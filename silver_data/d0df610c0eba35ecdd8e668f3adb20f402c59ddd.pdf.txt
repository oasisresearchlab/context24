Using Drosophila , we examined in which step of the synaptic vesicle cycle this motif functions . Polylysine motif mutants exhibited an apparent decreased Ca 2 (cid:1) afﬁnity of release , and , at low Ca 2 (cid:1) , an increased failure rate , increased facilitation , and increased augmentation , indicative of a decreased release probability . Disruption of Ca 2 (cid:1) binding , however , cannot account for all of the deﬁcits in the mutants ; rather , the decreased release probability is probably due to a disruption in the coupling of synaptotagmin to the release machinery . Mutants exhibited a major slowing of recovery from synaptic depression , which suggests that membrane trafﬁcking before fusion is disrupted . The disrupted process is not endocytosis because the rate of FM 1 - 43 uptake was unchanged in the mutants , and the polylysine motif mutant synaptotagmin was able to rescue the synaptic vesicle depletion normally found in syt null mutants . Thus , the polylysine motif functions after endocytosis and before fusion . Finally , mutation of the polylysine motif inhibits the Ca 2 (cid:1) - independent ability of synaptotagmin to accelerate SNARE ( soluble N - ethylmaleimide - sensitive factor attachment protein receptor ) - mediated fusion . Together , our results demonstrate that the polylysine motif is required for efﬁcient Ca 2 (cid:1) - independent docking and / or priming of synaptic vesicles in vivo . INTRODUCTION Synaptotagmin I is a synaptic vesicle protein whose cyto - plasmic region contains two C 2 domains , C 2 A and C 2 B ( Perin et al . , 1991 ; Brose et al . , 1992 ) . Although synaptotag - min is a Ca 2 (cid:1) sensor for synaptic vesicle exocytosis ( Brose et al . , 1992 ; Geppert et al . , 1994 ) , primarily via its C 2 B Ca 2 (cid:1) - binding motif ( Figure 1A , circles ; Mackler et al . , 2002 ; Nishiki and Augustine , 2004 ) , it likely mediates other molecular interactions via additional functional motifs . The C 2 B domain of synaptotagmin contains a highly con - served polybasic region ( Figure 1A , dashes ; Rickman et al . , 2004 ) . Three lysines within this region ( the polylysine motif ; Figure 1A , asterisks ) are required for full synaptotagmin function . In Drosophila , when these lysines are mutated to glutamines ( syt KQ ) and the syt KQ transgene is expressed in a syt null background ( (cid:2) / (cid:2) ; P [ syt KQ ] ) , evoked transmitter re - lease is decreased compared with transgenic wild - type con - trols ( (cid:2) / (cid:2) ; P [ syt WT ] ) ( Mackler and Reist , 2001 ) . The function of the polylysine motif within the synaptic vesicle cycle remains controversial . Results from in vitro experiments suggest this motif may mediate three steps in the synaptic vesicle cycle : 1 ) endocytosis , 2 ) Ca 2 (cid:1) - triggered vesicle fu - sion , and 3 ) Ca 2 (cid:1) - independent docking and / or priming of synaptic vesicles . Functional studies demonstrate that synaptotagmin I is re - quired for synaptic vesicle endocytosis ( von Poser et al . , 2000 ; Jarousse and Kelly , 2001 ; Jarousse et al . , 2003 ; Poskanzer et al . , 2003 ; Llina´s et al . , 2004 ; Nicholson - Tomishima and Ryan , 2004 ) , and in vitro studies suggest that the C 2 B domain of synaptotagmin may mediate this role ( von Poser et al . , 2000 ; Jarousse and Kelly , 2001 ; Littleton et al . , 2001 ; Jarousse et al . , 2003 ; Llina´s et al . , 2004 ) . Speciﬁcally , synaptic vesicle endo - cytosis may be mediated by the polylysine motif in the C 2 B domain of synaptotagmin ( Takei and Haucke , 2001 ; but see Poskanzer et al . , 2006 ) via Ca 2 (cid:1) - independent interactions with the clathrin adaptor protein AP - 2 ( Zhang et al . , 1994 ; Chapman et al . , 1998 ; Haucke and De Camilli , 1999 ; Haucke et al . , 2000 ; Littleton et al . , 2001 ; Grass et al . , 2004 ) and / or with phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate ( PIP 2 ) ( Bai et al . , 2004 ) . Both AP - 2 and PIP 2 play a role in clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( Cremona and De Camilli , 2001 ; Hurley and Wendland , 2002 ) . A second proposed function for the polylysine motif of synaptotagmin is regulation of Ca 2 (cid:1) - dependent processes ( Chapman et al . , 1998 ; Wu et al . , 2003 ; Borden et al . , 2005 ; Arac¸ et al . , 2006 ; Li et al . , 2006 ) . Polylysine motif mutations decrease the apparent Ca 2 (cid:1) afﬁnity of synaptotagmin ( Borden et al . , 2005 ; Li et al . , 2006 ) . Furthermore , in vitro studies have implicated this motif in three Ca 2 (cid:1) - depen - dent processes : the ability of synaptotagmin to oligomer - ize ( Chapman et al . , 1998 ; Wu et al . , 2003 ) , the ability of synaptotagmin to simultaneously bind to two membranes ( Arac¸ et al . , 2006 ) , and the ability of synaptotagmin to bind to negatively charged phospholipids ( Li et al . , 2006 ) .

The simultaneous bind - ing of synaptotagmin to two membranes has been proposed to accelerate membrane fusion by bringing the synaptic vesicle and plasma membrane into proximity ( Arac¸ et al . , 2006 ) . Finally , the polylysine motif may participate in a Ca 2 (cid:1) - independent interaction that either holds synaptic vesicles at release sites ( docking ) and / or subsequently increases their probability of release ( priming ) . Priming likely consists of multiple maturation steps that transform vesicles from a docked but not releasable state , through multiple releasable states with differing release properties ( Martin , 2003 ) . In the absence of Ca 2 (cid:1) , the polylysine motif of synaptotagmin preferentially binds to PIP 2 - containing membranes , poten - tially mediating vesicle docking via a trans - interaction be - tween the synaptic vesicle and the plasma membrane ( Bai et al . , 2004 ; Li et al . , 2006 ) where PIP 2 is predominantly located ( Holz et al . , 2000 ; Micheva et al . , 2001 ) . This interaction could also mediate Ca 2 (cid:1) - independent vesicle priming , because it increases the rate of synaptotagmin penetration into lipid membranes in vitro upon Ca 2 (cid:1) inﬂux ( Bai et al . , 2004 ) , which is postulated to be important for fusion ( Bai et al . , 2000 , 2002 ; Wang et al . , 2003 ; Rhee et al . , 2005 ) . Additionally , the poly - lysine motif of synaptotagmin binds to target membrane - soluble N - ethylmaleimide - sensitive factor attachment pro - tein receptor ( t - SNARE ) heterodimers ( syntaxin / synaptosome - associated protein 25 kDa [ SNAP - 25 ] ) in the absence of Ca 2 (cid:1) ( Rickman et al . , 2004 , 2006 ) . This Ca 2 (cid:1) - independent interaction may prime vesicles by bringing the synaptic vesicle ( v ) - SNARE ( vesicle - associated membrane protein [ VAMP ] or synaptobrevin ) into proximity with the t - SNARE heterodimer , preparing the vesicle for Ca 2 (cid:1) - trig - gered fusion via formation or stabilization of the SNARE complex ( VAMP / syntaxin / SNAP - 25 ; Xu et al . , 1999 ; Rick - man et al . , 2004 , 2006 ; Bhalla et al . , 2006 ) . Indeed , inclusion of synaptotagmin in v - SNARE – containing vesicles directly ac - celerates SNARE - mediated membrane fusion in a Ca 2 (cid:1) - in - dependent manner ( Mahal et al . , 2002 ) . Using Drosophila mutants , we show that the polylysine motif plays a role during synaptic vesicle recycling after endocytosis and before fusion . This role serves to increase the rate of recovery from synaptic depression and increase the efﬁcacy of synaptic vesicle fusion in vivo . Using a ﬂuo - rescent lipid mixing assay , we show that the polylysine motif mediates the Ca 2 (cid:1) - independent ability of synaptotag - min to accelerate SNARE - mediated fusion . We discuss these results in the context of a single deﬁcit hypothesis where the polylysine motif plays an important role in Ca 2 (cid:1) - indepen - dent docking / priming of synaptic vesicles . MATERIALS AND METHODS Fly Stocks The polylysine motif ( Figure 1A , asterisks ) of Drosophila synaptotagmin was mutated ( K 379 , 380 , 384 Q ) , and the mutant synaptotagmin was expressed from a transgene in a synaptotagmin null ( syt AD4 ) line . The experimental ﬂies ( (cid:2) / (cid:2) ; P [ syt KQ ] ) had the genotype yw ; syt AD4 P [ elav - Gal4 ] / syt AD4 ; P [ UAS syt K379 , 380 , 384Q ] / (cid:1) and were generated as described previously ( Mackler and Reist , 2001 ) . The control ﬂies ( (cid:2) / (cid:2) ; P [ syt WT ] ) expressed wild - type synaptotag - min I from a transgene ( Mackler and Reist , 2001 ) and had the genotype yw ; syt AD4 P [ elav - Gal4 ] / syt AD4 ; P [ UAS syt WT ] / (cid:1) . Two independent transgenic wild - type synaptotagmin lines and two independent transgenic C 2 B polylysine motif lines were generated . Because both lines of a given genotype had similar levels of evoked release ( control lines [ our unpublished data ] ; mutant lines , Mackler and Reist , 2001 ) , one control line ( 2C ) and one mutant line ( # 59 ) were used in subsequent experiments . Solutions Standard saline for these experiments is composed of 5 mM KCl , 2 mM CaCl 2 , 130 mM NaCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 36 mM sucrose , and 5 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 3 ( Jan and Jan , 1976 ) . In Ca 2 (cid:1) - free saline , the CaCl 2 was replaced by additional MgCl 2 . Stimulating saline contained 90 mM KCl , 5 mM CaCl 2 , 45 mM NaCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 36 mM sucrose , and 5 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 3 . HL3 saline contained 5 mM KCl , 70 mM NaCl , 20 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM NaHCO 3 , 5 mM HEPES , 115 mM sucrose , 5 mM trehalose , and 1 . 5 mM CaCl 2 ( Stewart et al . , 1994 ) . For the Ca 2 (cid:1) dependence curves , the CaCl 2 concentration in the HL3 saline varied ( 0 . 3 , 0 . 5 , 0 . 6 , 0 . 8 , 1 . 0 , 1 . 5 , 2 . 5 , 3 . 5 , 5 . 0 , or 6 . 0 mM ) , whereas the MgCl 2 concentration was held constant at 20 mM . Hyperosmotic saline consisted of HL3 saline containing 0 . 8 mM Ca 2 (cid:1) and 0 . 5 M sucrose . Dye Uptake Assay Synaptic boutons in Drosophila third instars were labeled with the activity - dependent , ﬂuorescent dye FM 1 - 43 ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) . Larvae were Figure 1 .

C . A . Loewen et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 5212 dissected in Ca 2 (cid:1) - free saline , stimulated for 6 min with stimulating saline , and then the stimulating saline was replaced with standard saline containing 3 (cid:2) M tetrodotoxin ( TTX ) for a variable length of time ( (cid:6) t (cid:4) 0 , 30 , 60 , or 180 s ) . TTX was added to block spontaneous activity coming from the attached CNS . After (cid:6) t , the preparation was incubated in standard saline (cid:1) 3 (cid:2) M TTX (cid:1) 4 (cid:2) m FM 1 - 43 dye for 6 min to load endocytosing vesicles , and then it was washed for 15 min with three changes of Ca 2 (cid:1) - free saline to remove excess extracellular dye . Fluorescence Microscopy and Image Processing FM 1 - 43 – labeled preparations were viewed using a 40 (cid:7) / 0 . 80 numerical ap - erture water immersion objective lens ( Leica , Bannockburn , IL ) on a DMRA light microscope ( Leica , Nussloch , Germany ) equipped with epiﬂuorescence optics ( 51019 EGFP / DsRed ﬁlter ; Chroma Technology , Brattleboro , VT ) and ﬁtted with a microstepping servomotor in the z - axis . Images were captured with a Hamamatsu charge - coupled device camera ( C4742 – 95 ) . A through focal series by using 0 . 4 - (cid:2) m steps was taken of each labeled neuromuscular junction . All imaging was accomplished within 2 min of ﬁrst exposure to light . Images were acquired , stored , and processed using Open Lab 2 . 2 . 0 software ( Improvision , Boston , MA ) on a Mac G - 4 platform . The average ﬂuorescence intensity of 12 – 15 brightly stained boutons with diameters (cid:3) 2 (cid:2) m were measured at each neuromuscular junction . Only boutons on muscle ﬁbers 6 and 7 from segment 3 or 4 were used . Only one neuromuscular junction per preparation was imaged . Nine neuromuscular junctions ( from 9 larvae ) were analyzed for each genotype . Each bouton was imaged in its optimal focal plane . Images were imported into the public domain Object Image program ( http : / / simon . bio . uva . nl / object - image . html ) . Background ﬂuorescence was measured over nearby muscle nuclei and was subtracted from the ﬂuorescence intensity of each bouton . Statistical compar - isons between genotypes were tested with a mixed model analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) by using SAS software 6 . 12 ( SAS Institute , Cary , NC ) . Electrophysiology Electrophysiology experiments were performed at room temperature in HL3 saline ( Stewart et al . , 1994 ) containing variable levels of Ca 2 (cid:1) ( see above ) . Recordings were from muscle ﬁber 6 from abdominal segments 3 and 4 of third instar ﬁllet preparations . Fibers were impaled with 15 - to 45 - M (cid:8) elec - trodes ﬁlled with a solution of 3 parts 2 M potassium citrate to 1 part 3 M potassium chloride or a 4 M potassium acetate solution . Segmental nerves were stimulated with a 5 - to 10 - (cid:2) m diameter glass micropipette ﬁlled with HL3 to evoke excitatory junctional potentials . Nerves were stimulated with 1 - ms pulses at the indicated frequency , and voltage traces were collected using an AxoClamp 2B ( Molecular Devices , Sunnyvale , CA ) and digitized using a MacLab4s A / D converter ( Chart or Scope software ; ADInstruments , Colorado Springs , CO ) . The resting membrane potential of each muscle ﬁber was normally between (cid:2) 65 and (cid:2) 45 mV but was maintained at about (cid:2) 55 mV by passing a bias current . KaleidaGraph software ( Synergy Software , Reading , PA ) was used to ﬁt linear regression lines to the data in Figure 3B and the Hill equation [ ( Max (cid:7) [ Ca 2 (cid:1) ] n ) / ( EC 50 n (cid:1) [ Ca 2 (cid:1) ] n ) ] to the data in Figure 3 , A and C . Hyperosmotic saline was pressure injected with a PLI - 100 PICO - INJECTOR ( Medical Systems , Greenvale , NY ) onto the neuromuscular junction for 10 s with an injection pressure of 1 . 0 psi by using a glass micropipette with a tip diameter (cid:5) 1 (cid:2) m . The recording electrode impaled the muscle at the extreme posterior end of the muscle , outside the area of hyperosmotic saline applica - tion , to reduce nonspeciﬁc leak current ( Aravamudan et al . , 1999 ) . Voltage traces were collected as described above . In a blind analysis , the number of quantal events within 1 - s intervals was binned during the 10 - s hyperosmotic puff as well as during the 10 s before and after the puff . Immunohistochemistry Experimental and control third instars were dissected in the same dish in cold Ca 2 (cid:1) - free HL3 saline ; ﬁxed in 4 % paraformaldehyde in phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) ; rinsed in PBS containing 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 and 0 . 02 % azide ( PBST ) ; and incubated overnight at 4°C in monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) nc82 ( Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank , University of Iowa , Iowa City , IA ) , diluted 1 : 100 in PBST containing 5 % normal goat serum ( PBST - NGS ) and anti - GluRIII antibody ( Marrus et al . , 2004 ) , diluted 1 : 200 in PBST - NGS . The preparations were washed in PBST , incubated for 1 h in Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti - mouse IgG ( Invitrogen ) , diluted 1 : 500 in PBST - NGS and Texas Red goat anti - rabbit IgG ( Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories , West Grove , PA ) , diluted 1 : 200 in PBST - NGS . Preparations were washed in PBST and mounted in Citiﬂuor AF - 1 ( Ted Pella , Redding , CA ) . Neuromuscular junctions from abdominal segments 3 or 4 were imaged on a Zeiss LSM 510Meta confocal microscope ( Carl Zeiss Microimaging , Thorn - wood , NY ) equipped with argon and HeNe1 lasers . Emissions were collected using a band pass 505 – 530 emission ﬁlter ( for Alexa Fluor 488 ) or a long pass 585 emission ﬁlter ( for Texas Red ) . Images were collected at 40 and 63 (cid:7) ( pinhole set for 1 Airy unit for each ) , and confocal settings were adjusted to optimize the intensity range of the signal . For all images used for quantitative analysis , the settings were held constant between control and experimental preparations . Eight - bit images were acquired and z - stacks were converted to projections using Zeiss LM510 software . For analysis , a region of interest ( ROI ) of constant area was drawn around each synaptic arborization as well as around a nearby area that contained only background staining . The histogram function of the software was used to determine the absolute number of pixels at every intensity ( 0 – 255 ) in these ROIs . To determine the intensity range of the signal ( i . e . , the range where the number of pixels in the signal was consistently greater than the number of pixels in the background ) , the number of pixels in the background ROI was subtracted from the number in the ROI containing the stained arborization for each intensity level . Once the intensity range of the signal was determined , the area of the signal was calculated by summing the number of pixels in the signal range . For Figure 2 , the gamma setting of a Codonics NP - 1600 Photo - graphic Network Printer was adjusted to match the image appearance on the screen . Electron Microscopy Third instars were dissected in cold Ca 2 (cid:1) - free HL3 saline and then embedded , sectioned , and stained as described previously ( Reist et al . , 1998 ) . Electron micrographs of neuromuscular junctions on muscle ﬁber number 6 and 7 from abdominal segments 3 or 4 were taken at 15 , 000 (cid:7) magniﬁcation on a JEOL JEM 2000 EX - II transmission electron microscope operated at 100 kV . Images were scanned using an Agfa DuoScan T2500 and adjusted for contrast using Adobe Photoshop software ( Adobe Systems , Mountain View , CA ) . Plasmid Construction and Site - directed Mutation for Fusion Proteins Syntaxin 1A ( amino acids 4 - 288 ) , SNAP - 25 ( amino acids 1 - 206 ) , and VAMP2 ( amino acids 1 - 116 ) from rat were all inserted into pGEX - KG ( between EcoRI and HindIII sites ) as glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) fusion proteins . Four native cysteines in SNAP - 25 , one in VAMP2 and three in syntaxin 1A , were replaced with alanines . The plasmid for rat synaptotagmin I with a truncated luminal domain ( amino acids 57 - 421 ) was inserted into pET - 28 ( b ) ( between NcoI and XhoI ) as a C - terminal His 6 - tagged protein . Among six native cys - teines of synaptotagmin I , ﬁve cysteines located in the transmembrane do - main were changed to alanines . The triple mutant ( K 326 , 327 , 331 Q ) was made using a QuikChange site - directed mutagenesis kit ( Stratagene , La Jolla , CA ) . The DNA sequences were conﬁrmed by DNA sequencing ( Iowa State Uni - versity DNA Sequencing Facility , Ames , IA ) . Protein Expression and Puriﬁcation The details of protein expression and puriﬁcation were described previously ( Lu et al . , 2005 ; Xu et al . , 2005 ) . Brieﬂy , GST - tagged proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli Rosetta ( DE3 ) pLysS ( Novagen , Madison , WI ) . GST fusion proteins were puriﬁed by afﬁnity chromatography using glutathione - agarose beads ( Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO ) . To purify proteins , the cell pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of PBST buffer [ phosphate - buffered saline , pH 7 . 4 , with 0 . 5 % ( vol / vol ) Triton X - 100 ] with the ﬁnal concentrations of 1 mM 4 - ( 2 - aminoethyl ) benzenesulfonyl ﬂuoride ( AEBSF ) , 1 mM EDTA , and 5 mM di - thiothreitol ( DTT ) . n - Lauroyl sarcosine ( 0 . 5 % ) was added to the solution . Cells were broken by sonication on the ice bath and centrifuged at 13 , 000 (cid:7) g for 20 min at 4°C . The supernatant was mixed with 5 ml of glutathione - agrose beads ( 50 % ) in PBST buffer and incubated in the cold room for 2 h . During incuba - tion for binding , 20 (cid:2) g / ml DNase I and 4 (cid:2) g / ml RNase were added . The beads were then washed with PBST buffer 10 times . The GST - tagged proteins were cleaved by bovine thrombin ( Calbiochem , San Diego , CA ) in PBS buffer containing 1 % n - octyl - d - glucopyranoside ( OG ) . The His - tagged synaptotagmin I was expressed in E . coli condon plus ( BL21 ) pLysS ( Stratagene ) and induced by 0 . 3 mM isopropyl - d - galactopyr - anoside . The cell pellet was sonicated and centrifuged in 10 ml of lysis buffer ( 25 mM HEPES , 400 mM KCl , 10 mM imidazole , 2 mM EDTA , 2 mM AEBSF , 2 mM DTT , 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 , and 0 . 5 % n - lauryl sarcosine , pH 7 . 4 ) . The supernatant was mixed with 2 ml of nickel - nitrilotriacetic acid ( Ni - NTA ) agarose beads ( QIAGEN , Valencia , CA ) . DNase I and RNase were added to the supernatant and the Ni - NTA beads mixture . After binding for 2 h at 4°C , Ni - NTA beads were washed with wash buffer six times . Synaptotagmin I was eluted in elution buffer ( 25 mM HEPES , 400 mM KCl , 400 mM imidazole , and 1 % OG , pH 8 . 0 ) . Puriﬁed proteins were examined with 15 % SDS – PAGE , and the purity was at least 90 % for all proteins . Membrane Reconstitution The procedure was described previously ( Lu et al . , 2005 , 2006 ) . Brieﬂy , syn - taxin 1A was incubated with SNAP - 25 for 1 h at room temperature to allow the formation of t - SNARE complex . The liposomes containing 1 - palmitoyl - 2 - dioleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphatidylcholine ( POPC ) and 1 , 2 - dioleoyl - sn - glyc - ero - 3 - phosphatidylserine ( DOPS ) ( molar ratio 85 : 15 ; 50 mM ) were reconsti - tuted with the preformed t - SNARE complex in a lipid / protein ratio of 200 : 1 . The ﬂuorescent liposomes containing POPC , DOPS , 1 , 2 - dioleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphoserine - N - ( 7 - nitro - 2 – 1 , 3 - benzoxadiazol - 4 - yl ) ( NBD - PS ) , and 1 , 2 - dio - leoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphoethanolamine - N - ( lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl ) ( rhodamine - PE ) ( molar ratio of 83 : 15 : 1 : 1 ; 10 mM ) were reconstituted with C 2 B Polylysine Motif of Synaptotagmin Vol . 17 , December 2006 5213 VAMP2 in 200 : 1 lipid / protein ratio . Synaptotagmin I was reconstituted with VAMP2 ( molar ratio 1 : 1 ) . To remove OG , the samples were diluted two times with dialysis buffer ( 25 mM HEPES and 100 mM KCl , pH 7 . 4 ) and then dialyzed against 2 liters of dialysis buffer at 4°C overnight . After dialysis , the solution was centrifuged at 10 , 000 (cid:7) g to remove protein and lipid aggregates . The reconstitution efﬁciencies were determined using SDS - PAGE and were at least 70 % . Total Fluorescence Lipid Mixing Assay To measure the lipid mixing , v - SNARE liposomes with or without synapto - tagmin I were mixed with t - SNARE liposomes in the ratio of 3 : 7 . The ﬁnal solution for each reaction contained (cid:9) 1 mM lipids in HEPES buffer ( 25 mM HEPES and 100 mM KCl , pH 7 . 4 , and 5 % glycerol ) with the total volume of 100 (cid:2) l . Fluorescence intensity was monitored with the excitation and emission wavelengths of 465 and 530 nm , respectively . The ﬂuorescence signal was recorded using a Varian Cary Eclipse model ﬂuorescence spectrophotometer with a quartz cell of 100 (cid:2) l with a 2 - mm path length . After 4000 s , 0 . 25 % n - dodecylmaltoside was added to obtain the maximum ﬂuorescence inten - sity . All of the lipid mixing experiments were carried out at 35°C . RESULTS Synaptic Transmission Is Disrupted in Synaptotagmin Polylysine Motif Mutants The C 2 B polylysine motif of synaptotagmin I is required for efﬁcient synaptic transmission ( Figures 1 , B and C , and 3 ; Mackler and Reist , 2001 ; Borden et al . , 2005 ; Li et al . , 2006 ) . We examined excitatory junctional potentials ( EJPs ) in Dro - sophila synaptotagmin null third instars that expressed either a wild - type synaptotagmin transgene ( (cid:2) / (cid:2) ; P [ syt WT ] ) or a C 2 B - polylysine motif mutant transgene ( (cid:2) / (cid:2) ; P [ syt KQ ] ) . Fig - ure 1B shows representative traces recorded in saline con - taining 1 . 5 mM Ca 2 (cid:1) . Because both the polylysine motif transgene and the control transgene exhibit similar levels of synaptotagmin expression ( Mackler and Reist , 2001 ) , the only difference between these lines is the mutation in the C 2 B polylysine motif of synaptotagmin . Figure 1C illustrates that the average EJP amplitude at third instar neuromuscu - lar junctions in saline containing 1 . 5 mM Ca 2 (cid:1) was 14 . 2 (cid:3) 0 . 82 mV for polylysine motif mutants ( (cid:2) / (cid:2) ; P [ syt KQ ] ; n (cid:4) 34 ﬁbers ) and 32 . 4 (cid:3) 0 . 99 mV for transgenic wild - type controls ( (cid:2) / (cid:2) ; P [ syt WT ] ; n (cid:4) 42 ﬁbers ) . Thus , similar to what has been reported previously for this synapse ( Mackler and Reist , 2001 ) , evoked transmitter release in 1 . 5 mM Ca 2 (cid:1) was de - creased in polylysine motif mutants to (cid:9) 45 % of transgenic controls . The Postsynaptic Responsiveness Is Not Changed in Synaptotagmin Polylysine Motif Mutants To verify that the decrease in the evoked response was not due to a developmental disruption that resulted in a re - duced number of postsynaptic glutamate receptors or pre - synaptic active zones , we examined GluRIII ( Marrus et al . , 2004 ) and nc82 ( an active zone marker ; Wucherpfennig et al . , 2003 ; Qin et al . , 2005 ) staining in polylysine motif mutants and controls ( Figure 2 ) .

Loewen et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 5214 47 , 000 (cid:3) 5500 pixels at 40 (cid:7) magniﬁcation ( mean (cid:3) SEM ) ] was not signiﬁcantly different in polylysine motif mutants compared with transgenic controls ( p (cid:10) 0 . 78 , Student’s t test ; n (cid:4) 6 junctions for each genotype ) . In addition , the ampli - tude of spontaneous fusion events is unchanged in the mu - tants ( Mackler and Reist , 2001 ) , demonstrating that the den - sity of glutamate receptors is unchanged . Because neither the area nor density of postsynaptic receptors is changed , the postsynaptic response to neurotransmitter release is un - altered in the mutants . Furthermore , the area of nc82 stain - ing [ polylysine motif mutants : 65 , 200 (cid:3) 7500 ; transgenic controls : 63 , 800 (cid:3) 7600 pixels at 40 (cid:7) ( mean (cid:3) SEM ) ] is also not signiﬁcantly different in the mutants ( p (cid:10) 0 . 78 , Student’s t test ; n (cid:4) 6 junctions for each genotype ) . Thus , the decrease in the evoked response in polylysine motif mutants likely results from a defect in vesicle availability or release prob - ability , because it does not result from a decrease in the ability of the postsynaptic cell to respond to neurotransmit - ter nor a decrease in the active zone area . The Calcium Cooperativity of Release Is Unchanged in the Polylysine Motif Mutants , but the Apparent Calcium Afﬁnity of Release Is Decreased During synaptic transmission , the amount of neurotransmit - ter release triggered by nerve stimulation depends on some power ( n ) of the extracellular Ca 2 (cid:1) concentration . In 1967 , Dodge and Rahamimoff showed at frog neuromuscular junctions that the dependence of release on extracellular Ca 2 (cid:1) can be explained by assuming a cooperative action of (cid:9) 4 Ca 2 (cid:1) ions ( Dodge and Rahamimoff , 1967 ) . Support for the hypothesis that the binding of three to ﬁve Ca 2 (cid:1) ions to a Ca 2 (cid:1) sensor ( s ) triggers neurotransmitter release has sub - sequently been demonstrated at other synapses as well , such as goldﬁsh retinal bipolar synapses ( Heidelberger et al . , 1994 ) , the rat Calyx of Held ( Bollmann et al . , 2000 ) , and Drosophila neuromuscular junctions ( Littleton et al . , 1994 ; Stewart et al . , 2000 ; Yoshihara and Littleton , 2002 ; Okamoto et al . , 2005 ) . To determine whether a disruption of Ca 2 (cid:1) binding by the polylysine motif mutant synaptotagmin con - tributed to the mutants’ decreased release , we examined the Ca 2 (cid:1) dependence of release in both the polylysine motif mutants and the transgenic controls ( Figure 3 ) . To estimate the Ca 2 (cid:1) dependence of release , we measured the mean EJP amplitude at various extracellular Ca 2 (cid:1) con - centrations for both polylysine motif mutants and transgenic controls ( Figure 3A ) . To examine the Ca 2 (cid:1) cooperativity of release , we graphed the mean EJP amplitude versus extra - cellular Ca 2 (cid:1) concentration on a double log plot ( Figure 3B ) , and we determined that the slope for the polylysine motif mutants was 3 . 3 in nonsaturating Ca 2 (cid:1) ranges . This is sim - ilar to the cooperativity of 3 . 1 that was measured in our transgenic wild - type controls and to values ( 3 . 0 – 3 . 6 ) re - ported previously for Drosophila neuromuscular junctions ( Littleton et al . , 1994 ; Stewart et al . , 2000 ; Yoshihara and Littleton , 2002 ; Okamoto et al . , 2005 ) . Thus , the polylysine motif mutation does not alter the number of Ca 2 (cid:1) ions necessary to trigger neurotransmitter release . Although the Ca 2 (cid:1) cooperativity of release was not changed in the polylysine motif mutants , the EC 50 was changed . To illustrate the increase in EC 50 in the polylysine motif mutants , the EJP amplitudes were normalized to the predicted maximum value of the Hill equation for each genotype and replotted in Figure 3C [ EC 50 (cid:4) 1 . 69 (cid:3) 0 . 08 mM for (cid:2) / (cid:2) ; P [ syt KQ ] and EC 50 (cid:4) 1 . 20 (cid:3) 0 . 05 for (cid:2) / (cid:2) ; P [ syt WT ] ( mean (cid:3) SEM ) ] . Thus , the polylysine motif mutants exhibit an (cid:9) 40 % increase in EC 50 . Because the cooperativity of release is unchanged in these mutants , the increase in EC 50 corresponds to an (cid:9) 40 % decrease in the apparent Ca 2 (cid:1) afﬁnity of release . Similar results have been reported for cultured , hippocampal neurons expressing synaptotagmin Figure 3 . Calcium cooperativity of release is unchanged in the polylysine motif mutants , but the apparent calcium afﬁnity and efﬁcacy of release are decreased .

Synaptotagmin Polylysine Motif Mutants Have a Decreased Release Probability The ﬁnding that the mutants exhibit less release at every Ca 2 (cid:1) concentration indicates that the polylysine motif mu - tants have a decreased release probability and / or a decrease in the number of readily releasable vesicles . To examine release probability , we measured synaptic facilitation and augmentation during high frequency stimulation . Although the mechanisms underlying short - term plasticity are not completely understood , generally a decrease in release prob - ability results in greater synaptic augmentation and facilita - tion ( Atwood and Karunanithi , 2002 ; Zucker and Regehr , 2002 ) . EJPs were evoked by 10 - Hz stimulation for 30 s . Polylysine motif mutants exhibited larger synaptic augmen - tation than transgenic control larvae in 1 . 5 mM extracellular Ca 2 (cid:1) ( Figure 4A ) and still exhibited synaptic augmentation at 2 . 0 mM extracellular Ca 2 (cid:1) , a concentration where control larvae no longer augment ( Figure 4B ) . In addition , polyly - sine motif mutants exhibited facilitation during the ﬁrst few pulses of 10 Hz stimulation in 1 . 5 mM Ca 2 (cid:1) , but transgenic control larvae did not ( Figure 4A , insets ) . Examination of the Ca 2 (cid:1) concentration where evoked release failed in the mu - tants also indicates a decrease in release probability . At 0 . 5 mM extracellular Ca 2 (cid:1) , the failure rate in controls was 21 (cid:3) 5 % , whereas that of the polylysine motif mutants was 64 (cid:3) 14 % ( p (cid:5) 0 . 05 ) . Thus , polylysine motif mutants exhibit a decreased release probability compared with transgenic con - trol larvae . The Readily Releasable Pool of Synaptic Vesicles Is Unaltered in Synaptotagmin Polylysine Motif Mutants To determine whether there was also a change in the number of readily releasable vesicles , we elicited synaptic vesicle fusion with hypertonic sucrose . In Drosophila ( Aravamudan et al . , 1999 ; Suzuki et al . , 2002a , b ) as in frog ( Fatt and Katz , 1952 ; Chen and Grinnell , 1997 ; Kashani et al . , 2001 ) and in cultured neuronal cells ( Stevens and Tsujimoto , 1995 ; Rosenmund and Stevens , 1996 ; Mochida et al . , 1998 ) , application of a hypertonic sucrose solution dramatically increases the frequency of min - iature synaptic potentials . External Ca 2 (cid:1) is not needed for this response ( Rosenmund and Stevens , 1996 ; Mochida et al . , 1998 ; Suzuki et al . , 2002a , b ) ; however , the response is blocked when neuronal synaptobrevin ( n - syb , also known as VAMP ) , SNAP - 25 , or syntaxin ( syx ) is cleaved by clostridial neurotoxin ( Ca - pogna et al . , 1997 ) , and it is greatly reduced in n - syb , syx , or Unc - 13 Drosophila knockouts ( Aravamudan et al . , 1999 ) . Thus , the hypertonic sucrose response is thought to bypass the Ca 2 (cid:1) - sensing step of vesicle fusion and to trigger the fusion of docked vesicles ( Rosenmund and Stevens , 1996 ; Schikorski and Stevens , 2001 ) by using the same basic fusion machinery that underlies Ca 2 (cid:1) - triggered fusion . Furthermore , at Drosophila neuromuscular junctions , the size of the hypertonic response correlates with the size of the readily releasable pool of synap - tic vesicles ( Aravamudan et al . , 1999 ; Suzuki et al . , 2002a , b ; Okamoto et al . , 2005 ) . During a puff - application of 500 mM sucrose for 10 s , the frequency of miniature synaptic potentials ( minis ) dramati - cally increased in both polylysine motif mutants and trans - genic controls ( Figure 5 ) . Figure 5A shows sample record - ings from mutant and control larvae in both synaptic and nonsynaptic regions of the muscle ﬁber . The basal frequency of minis is elevated in each genotype only when sucrose is puffed on the synaptic region . The frequency before , during , and after the sucrose puff was determined and is plotted in Figure 5B . The basal frequency was higher in polylysine motif mutants than in controls ( Figure 5B ; Mackler and Reist , 2001 ) . Therefore , to facilitate comparison between ge - notypes , the average frequency during the 10 s before the sucrose puff was subtracted from the calculated frequencies within each genotype ( Figure 5C ) . The sucrose response in the polylysine motif mutants was comparable to that of controls . Thus , the decrease in the Ca 2 (cid:1) - evoked response recorded in the polylysine motif mutants ( Figure 3 ) is not Figure 4 . Polylysine motif mutants have a de - creased release probability compared with trans - genic controls . EJPs were evoked by 30 s of 10 - Hz stimulation in 1 . 5 mM ( A ) or 2 . 0 mM ( B ) extracellu - lar Ca 2 (cid:1) . EJP amplitudes were normalized to the amplitude of the EJP evoked by the ﬁrst pulse and then averaged . After the ﬁrst nine points , the points plotted are averages of 10 EJPs .

Molecular Biology of the Cell 5216 due to a decrease in the size of the readily releasable pool of synaptic vesicles ( Figure 5 ) , but rather to a decrease in the release probability ( Figure 4 ) . The Polylysine Motif Mutation Slows Synaptotagmin (cid:1) SNARE - mediated Lipid Mixing In Vitro A decreased release probability could result from disruption of either Ca 2 (cid:1) sensing or synaptic vesicle docking / priming . The decrease in apparent Ca 2 (cid:1) afﬁnity of release ( Figure 3C ) suggests a disruption in Ca 2 (cid:1) sensing . Yet , decreased Ca 2 (cid:1) afﬁnity could only account for a decrease in the maximum amplitude of release ( Figure 3A ) if the Ca 2 (cid:1) afﬁnity has decreased to such an extent that the intracellular Ca 2 (cid:1) con - centration can never reach a level sufﬁcient to trigger max - imal release . Although at high extracellular Ca 2 (cid:1) concentra - tions , the Ca 2 (cid:1) inﬂux through voltage - gated Ca 2 (cid:1) channels is expected to saturate ( Hagiwara and Takahashi , 1967 ) , at Drosophila neuromuscular junctions , this saturation is only reached when extracellular Ca 2 (cid:1) is (cid:3) 10 mM ( Okamoto et al . , 2005 ) . Because the maximal response recorded in our poly - lysine motif mutants occurs around 5 mM ( Figure 3A ) , well below saturation levels for Ca 2 (cid:1) channels , the decrease in maximal release recorded in these mutants is not due to the decrease in apparent Ca 2 (cid:1) afﬁnity . Indeed , a decrease in the efﬁcacy of release is more likely due to a disruption in the coupling of synaptotagmin to the release machinery ( Borden et al . , 2005 ) . On Ca 2 (cid:1) inﬂux , the interaction of synaptotagmin with the presynaptic membrane is thought to be important for fusion ( Bai et al . , 2000 , 2002 ; Wang et al . , 2003 ; Rhee et al . , 2005 ) . The Ca 2 (cid:1) - independent interaction of the polylysine motif with t - SNARE heterodimers ( Rickman et al . , 2004 ) may play an important role in coupling synaptotagmin to the release machinery by positioning the Ca 2 (cid:1) - binding site of the C 2 B domain near the plasma membrane . This Ca 2 (cid:1) - independent interaction would thus prime synaptic vesicles for efﬁcient fusion . To directly test the importance of the C 2 B polylysine motif in Ca 2 (cid:1) - independent facilitation of fusion , we exam - ined the rate of fusion in a ﬂuorescence lipid mixing assay . When v - SNARE – containing liposomes are mixed with lipo - somes containing t - SNARE heterodimers in the absence of Ca 2 (cid:1) , SNARE complex - speciﬁc fusion of the two popula - tions occurred ( Figure 6A ; Weber et al . , 1998 ; Parlati et al . , 1999 ) . Addition of membrane - bound synaptotagmin into the v - SNARE – containing liposomes directly accelerated the rate of fusion in a Ca 2 (cid:1) - independent manner ( Figure 6 , A and B ; Mahal et al . , 2002 ) consistent with the hypothesis that a Ca 2 (cid:1) - independent interaction between synaptotagmin and t - SNARE heterodimers facilitates SNARE - dependent fusion . Mutation of the polylysine motif , which has been shown to block the Ca 2 (cid:1) - independent interaction between synapto - tagmin and t - SNARE heterodimers ( Rickman et al . , 2004 ) , abolished the ability of synaptotagmin to accelerate the fu - sion reaction ( Figure 6 , A and B ) . These results indicate that the polylysine motif of synaptotagmin plays a critical role in Ca 2 (cid:1) - independent vesicle docking / priming and / or fusion in vitro . Synaptic Vesicle Recycling Is Slowed in Polylysine Motif Mutants In Vivo If the polylysine motif were important for synaptic vesicle docking / priming before Ca 2 (cid:1) - triggered fusion in vivo , then the polylysine motif mutants should exhibit a defect in synaptic vesicle availability , a process upstream of Ca 2 (cid:1) sensing . First , we investigated whether the polylysine motif functions in maintaining the supply of synaptic vesicles available for Ca 2 (cid:1) - triggered fusion by examining the ability of the mutants to sustain neurotransmitter release at the neuromuscular junction during high - frequency stimulation . When the rate of resupply is slower than the rate of synaptic vesicle exocytosis , the result is a net loss of synaptic vesicles available for release , which is reﬂected in decreasing EJP amplitudes . Thus , the degree of synaptic depression reﬂects the balance between synaptic vesicle exocytosis and synaptic vesicle resupply , which would include both synaptic vesicle mobilization and recycling ( Delgado et al . , 2000 ) . Second , because recovery from synaptic depression occurs by syn - aptic vesicle recycling rather than vesicle mobilization from a reserve pool ( Pyle et al . , 2000 ; Richards et al . , 2003 ) , we Figure 5 . Size of the readily releasable pool of synaptic vesicles is unchanged in synaptotagmin polylysine motif mutants . ( A ) Sample traces showing that application of a hypertonic sucrose solution ( bar ) to synaptic regions for 10 s increases the frequency of minia - ture synaptic potentials . ( B ) Frequency of miniature synaptic poten - tials is plotted versus time from 10 s before to 10 s after the application of sucrose . ( C ) Because the basal rate of spontaneous release is greater in the mutants , the frequency of release was normalized to the basal rate within each genotype for comparison . The sucrose - induced , increased frequency in polylysine motif mu - tants ( gray triangles , n (cid:4) 9 ﬁbers ) is comparable to that in transgenic controls ( black circles , n (cid:4) 9 ﬁbers ) . Error bars are SEM . C 2 B Polylysine Motif of Synaptotagmin Vol . 17 , December 2006 5217 investigated whether the polylysine motif functions specif - ically during synaptic vesicle recycling by examining the mutants’ ability to recover from synaptic depression . During 30 s of 10 - Hz stimulation in 5 mM Ca 2 (cid:1) , the larval neuromuscular junction exhibited synaptic depression ( Fig - ure 7 ) . Both the sample traces in Figure 7A and the averaged data graphed in Figure 7B illustrate that during 30 s of stimulation , evoked release decreased to a greater extent in polylysine motif mutants than in transgenic controls . To compare the magnitude of depression in mutant and control transgenic lines , EJP amplitudes were normalized to the EJP amplitude elicited by the ﬁrst pulse in the train . Despite that the polylysine motif mutants have a decreased release prob - ability and release fewer vesicles with each stimulus ( Figure 3 , 5 mM Ca 2 (cid:1) ) , they exhibited a small ( (cid:9) 6 % ) increase in the magnitude of depression ( Figure 7B ) . However , this appar - ent increase in synaptic depression might be an artifact of nonlinear summation . Because the EJP amplitudes are larger in the controls ( Figures 3A and 7A ) , they would be more affected by nonlinear summation , which would underesti - mate their true degree of synaptic depression relative to the mutants . To explore this possibility , we applied the equation of Martin ( 1955 ) as an estimate to correct for nonlinear summation ( our unpublished data ) . Indeed , using this cor - rection factor , the polylysine motif mutants exhibited slightly less ( (cid:9) 4 % ) synaptic depression than controls . How - ever , because this formula is an imperfect correction ( McLachlan and Martin , 1981 ) , the true degree of synaptic depression is likely somewhere between that calculated from the noncorrected and corrected EJP amplitudes . Thus , the degree of synaptic depression is likely quite similar between mutants and controls . Recovery from synaptic depression was examined either 5 or 15 s after the 30 s of 10 - Hz stimulation ceased ( Figure 7B ) . Only larvae that exhibited (cid:3) 95 % recovery at an extended time point were included . Recovery from synaptic depres - sion was dramatically slower in polylysine motif mutants than in transgenic controls . After 5 s , the mutants showed 41 % less recovery than controls and by 15 s the mutants were still depressed 24 % , whereas controls had already com - pletely recovered . The slower rate of recovery in polylysine motif mutants in vivo demonstrates that a major defect caused by the polylysine motif mutation occurs during syn - aptic vesicle recycling before the Ca 2 (cid:1) - dependent fusion step ; if a disruption of Ca 2 (cid:1) - dependent fusion were the primary defect in these mutants , they should recover from synaptic depression as quickly as controls . It also suggests that the polylysine motif functions in a Ca 2 (cid:1) - independent process , because Ca 2 (cid:1) levels drop rapidly upon the cessa - tion of stimulation ( within a few seconds ; Wu and Betz , 1996 ; Karunanithi et al . , 1997 ; Suzuki et al . , 2000 ; Macleod et al . , 2002 ) . Synaptic Vesicle Endocytosis Is Not Impaired in Polylysine Motif Mutants Our in vitro studies demonstrate a Ca 2 (cid:1) - independent role for the polylysine motif in docking / priming and / or fusion , whereas our in vivo studies demonstrate a Ca 2 (cid:1) - indepen - dent role before Ca 2 (cid:1) - triggered fusion . Together , these stud - ies support a role for the polylysine motif in docking / priming ; however , they do not exclude additional disruptions during synaptic vesicle recycling . Recycling consists of many steps that include , but are not limited to , endocytosis , clathrin uncoating , reﬁlling with neurotransmitter , docking , and priming of vesicles . Because functional studies demon - strate that synaptotagmin I is required during endocytosis ( von Poser et al . , 2000 ; Jarousse and Kelly , 2001 ; Jarousse et al . , 2003 ; Poskanzer et al . , 2003 ; Llina´s et al . , 2004 ; Nicholson - Tomishima and Ryan , 2004 ) and the polylysine motif of the C 2 B domain of synaptotagmin is postulated to mediate this role ( Takei and Haucke , 2001 ; but see Poskanzer et al . , 2006 ) , we wanted to determine whether endocytosis was disrupted in our mutants . However , the rate of endocytosis is difﬁcult to assess in mutants with defects in exocytosis . Therefore , we investigated the importance of the C 2 B polylysine motif for endocytosis by using three approaches . Figure 6 . Polylysine motif mutation abolishes synaptotagmin’s Ca 2 (cid:1) - independent ability to accelerate SNARE - mediated fusion . Fusion of v - SNARE liposomes ( VAMP ) with t - SNARE liposomes ( syx / SNAP - 25 ) was monitored via a ﬂuorescence lipid mixing assay in the absence of Ca 2 (cid:1) . ( A ) Sample traces showing the increase in ﬂuorescence when t - SNARE liposomes are mixed with v - SNARE liposomes that do not contain synaptotagmin ( syx / SNAP - 25 (cid:1) VAMP ) , with v - SNARE liposomes that contain wild - type synaptotagmin ( syx / SNAP - 25 (cid:1) VAMP , syt WT ) or with v - SNARE liposomes that contain the polylysine motif mutant synaptotagmin ( syx / SNAP - 25 (cid:1) VAMP , syt KQ ) . Light gray trace shows the background rate of lipid mixing when SNAP - 25 is omitted from the t - SNARE liposomes ( syx (cid:1) VAMP ) .

After subtraction of background fusion ( syx (cid:1) VAMP ) , values were normalized to fusion in the absence of synaptotagmin and plotted as fusion efﬁciency . n (cid:4) 3 ; error bars are SD . C . A . Loewen et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 5218 As a ﬁrst step in examining endocytosis , the ability of the mutants to maintain a supply of synaptic vesicles for release was further challenged by stimulating preparations at 10 Hz for 4 min in 5 mM Ca 2 (cid:1) . The averaged data ( Figure 8A ) illustrate that during the 4 min of stimulation evoked release decreased to a greater extent in polylysine motif mutants than in transgenic controls . To compare the magnitude of depression in mutant and control transgenic lines , EJP am - plitudes were binned at 5 - s intervals and normalized to the ﬁrst EJP amplitude bin ( Figure 8B ) . EJP amplitudes from polylysine motif mutants did decrease to a greater extent than the transgenic controls . Although this result seems to suggest that the rate of synaptic vesicle resupply relative to the rate of exocytosis is slowed in the polylysine motif mutants compared with controls , again this apparent differ - ence is probably exaggerated by nonlinear summation . In - deed , when the correction factor of Martin ( Martin , 1955 ) is applied , the polylysine motif mutants again show less de - pression ( (cid:9) 4 % ) than controls ( our unpublished data ) . Even without the correction factor , the increased synaptic depres - sion in the polylysine motif mutants is not severe ( 5 % more depression after 60 s and 15 % more after 4 min ) . Thus , the polylysine motif mutants are able to maintain release rela - tively well for at least 4 min of 10 - Hz stimulation , an unex - pected result if the polylysine motif were critical for endo - cytosis . A common ultrastructural phenotype seen at neuromus - cular junctions in endocytic mutants is severe synaptic ves - icle depletion ( Koenig et al . , 1989 ; Fernandez et al . , 1998 ; Verstreken et al . , 2002 , 2003 ) . Indeed , syt null mutants in Dro - sophila exhibit such depletion , along with an accumulation of larger membranous structures ( Figure 9 , bottom ; Reist et al . , 1998 ; Loewen et al . , 2006 ) . Therefore , our second approach was to examine the synaptic ultrastructure of polylysine motif mutants to see whether they exhibited synaptic vesicle depletion , indicative of an endocytic defect . The boutons of transgenic control larvae ( Figure 9 , top ) and polylysine motif mutants ( Figure 9 , middle ) contain numerous synaptic vesicles located at active zones and throughout the nerve terminal , and no accumulation of larger membranous structures ( compare to syt null mutants , Figure 9 , bottom ) . Thus , both the polylysine motif mutant transgene and the wild - type transgene are able to rescue the ultrastructural deﬁcits seen in syt null mutant terminals . Again , this ﬁnding suggests that the polylysine motif of synaptotagmin does not mediate the role of synaptotagmin in synaptic vesicle endocytosis . Furthermore , it is consistent with our ﬁnding that the readily releasable pool size is not changed in polylysine motif mutants ( Figure 5 ) . Finally , to examine the rate of endocytosis in polylysine motif mutants directly , we used an FM 1 - 43 dye uptake assay . FM 1 - 43 ﬂuoresces when it inserts into lipid mem - branes . If it is present when synaptic vesicle membrane is internalized , these synaptic vesicles will be ﬂuorescently labeled . Subsequently , the dye can be washed from the outside of cells , leaving only the internalized synaptic vesi - cles labeled . Thus , FM 1 - 43 makes it possible to examine the process of endocytosis directly ( Betz et al . , 1992 ) . Figure 10A illustrates the endocytic assay we used to test the involvement of the polylysine motif in endocytosis [ adapted from the assays of ( Ryan et al . , 1996 ; Kuromi and Kidokoro , 1998 ; Stimson et al . , 2001 ; Kim et al . , 2002 ) ] . Dro - sophila third instars were stimulated for 6 min with a stim - ulating saline containing high potassium . Stimulation was terminated when the stimulating saline was replaced by standard saline plus 3 (cid:2) M TTX . TTX was included to block any spontaneous action potentials coming from the attached CNS . The standard saline (cid:1) TTX was left on the preparation for a variable amount of time ( (cid:6) t (cid:4) 0 , 30 , 60 , or 180 s ) . After (cid:6) t , the preparation was bathed in standard saline containing TTX and FM 1 - 43 for 6 min to label endocytosing vesicles . Finally the preparation was washed for 15 min with 3 changes of Ca 2 (cid:1) - free saline to remove extracellular FM 1 - 43 from the plasma membrane . Ca 2 (cid:1) - free saline was used to minimize vesicle fusion during the washing stage . After washing , the ﬂuorescence intensity of the FM 1 - 43 - labeled synaptic boutons was measured . Because FM 1 - 43 is present after stimulation ceases , and the signal is subsequently normalized to its maximum ( see below ) , the above - mentioned protocol allowed us to deter - mine the rate of internalization independent of the rate of exocytosis ( Ryan et al . , 1996 ; Stimson et al . , 2001 ; Kim et al . , 2002 ) . However , only those synaptic vesicles that remain on Figure 7 . Polylysine motif mutants recover more slowly from syn - aptic depression than transgenic controls . Synaptic depression was elicited by stimulating ﬁbers at 10 Hz for 30 s in 5 mM extracellular Ca 2 (cid:1) . Recovery was monitored by recording the EJP amplitude of a single shock either 5 or 15 s after the 10 - Hz stimulation stopped . Each ﬁber was also stimulated at an extended time point ( (cid:9) 140 s ) to verify full recovery .

C 2 B Polylysine Motif of Synaptotagmin Vol . 17 , December 2006 5219 the surface at the end of the stimulation can be labeled . Thus , a strong stimulus was needed to provide sufﬁcient ﬂuorescent signals for analysis . In standard saline contain - ing 1 . 5 mM Ca 2 (cid:1) , evoked release is only 14 . 2 (cid:3) 0 . 82 mV in the polylysine mutants ( Figures 1B and 3A ) and the FM 1 - 43 labeling achieved by the above - mentioned protocol was quite dim . Because our goal in these experiments was to determine whether endocytosis is a major defect in the poly - lysine motif mutants , we increased the Ca 2 (cid:1) in the stimu - lating saline to 5 mM to maximize release in these mutants and thus to increase FM 1 - 43 labeling . During the delay period between the end of stimulation and addition of FM 1 - 43 dye , (cid:6) t , some fraction of the syn - aptic vesicle membrane remaining on the plasma membrane undergoes endocytosis . As (cid:6) t increases , more and more vesicle membrane is internalized , leaving less vesicle mem - brane on the surface to be labeled when FM 1 - 43 is subse - quently applied . Therefore , as (cid:6) t increases , less FM 1 - 43 is internalized and nerve terminal labeling becomes progres - sively dimmer . This is illustrated in Figure 10B , which shows FM 1 - 43 - labeled synaptic boutons on muscle 6 and 7 in both transgenic control and polylysine motif mutant lar - Figure 8 .

In both polylysine motif mutant and transgenic control larvae , labeling was brightest at (cid:6) t (cid:4) 0 s and dimmest at (cid:6) t (cid:4) 180 s . Loading was dependent on both stimulation and Ca 2 (cid:1) ( our unpublished data ) . At all time points , the mean ﬂuorescence of polylysine motif mutant boutons was somewhat lower than the mean ﬂuorescence for controls . This is most likely because the mutants exocytose fewer vesicles than the controls during the stimulation . Figure 10C shows the mean level of FM 1 - 43 labeling at (cid:6) t (cid:4) 0 s for both mutants and controls . Under these stimulation conditions ( high K (cid:1) , high Ca 2 (cid:1) for 6 min ) , the amount of membrane awaiting endocytosis after stimu - lation ceased was only (cid:9) 10 % less in the polylysine motif mutants . Because exocytosis is (cid:9) 40 % less in the mutants in 5 mM Ca 2 (cid:1) ( Figure 3A ) , this relative buildup of vesicle membrane stranded in the plasma membrane could indicate that endocytosis is slowed in the mutants . However , a single time point cannot accurately measure the rate of endocytosis because other factors , such as the size of the releasable pools and saturation of the endocytic machinery , can also inﬂu - ence the amount of membrane awaiting endocytosis . So , to determine the kinetics of synaptic vesicle internalization independent of this (cid:9) 10 % difference , we normalized our data according to previous methods used to compare endo - cytic rates between preparations with different amounts of exocytosis ( Ryan et al . , 1996 ; Stimson et al . , 2001 ; Kim et al . , 2002 ) . Thus , the ﬂuorescence value of each bouton was normalized to the mean ﬂuorescence value of boutons of the corresponding genotype at (cid:6) t (cid:4) 0 s . If the rate of endocytosis were impaired in polylysine motif mutant larvae , then during any given (cid:6) t , they should not be able to endocytose as large a fraction of the remaining synaptic vesicle membrane as controls . As a result , a larger proportion of synaptic vesicle membrane would remain in the plasma membrane when the FM 1 - 43 was applied , lead - ing to proportionally more FM 1 - 43 internalization . Thus , if polylysine motif mutants had endocytic deﬁcits , then after any given (cid:6) t , polylysine motif terminals should exhibit a normalized ﬂuorescence that was brighter than controls . Indeed , stoned mutants , which also exhibit a decrease in evoked release , were shown to have an endocytic defect using a similar assay ( Stimson et al . , 2001 ) . C 2 B polylysine motif mutants , in contrast , do not ( Figure 10D ) . At each time point , the normalized ﬂuorescence of the mutant terminals was slightly lower than that of controls . Lower ﬂuorescence values would suggest a faster rate of endocytosis in the mutants , not an impaired rate . However , the differences between polylysine motif mutants and transgenic controls were not statistically signiﬁcant . The mixed model ANOVA used to generate a 95 % conﬁdence interval for the true difference between mutants and controls included 0 ( (cid:2) 11 . 6 , 2 . 75 ) . Because the rate of endocytosis was not disrupted in the mutants , the relatively small difference in labeling at (cid:6) t (cid:4) 0 s ( Figure 10C ) suggests that endocytosis was the rate - limiting step and that our strong stimulation protocol successfully drove the majority of the cycling vesicle mem - brane ( which is approximately equal in mutants and con - trols ; Figure 5C ) to the surface . DISCUSSION The highly conserved C 2 B polylysine motif plays a func - tional role in the synaptic vesicle cycle . Mutations in this motif decrease the amplitude of the evoked response at all Figure 10 . Rate of endocytosis is not signiﬁcantly different in synaptotagmin polylysine motif mutants .

C 2 B Polylysine Motif of Synaptotagmin Vol . 17 , December 2006 5221 Ca 2 (cid:1) concentrations ; increase the EC 50 of Ca 2 (cid:1) for release ; increase augmentation , facilitation , and failure rate at low Ca 2 (cid:1) concentrations ; cause a marked decrease in the rate of recovery from synaptic depression ; block Ca 2 (cid:1) - independent interactions with t - SNARE heterodimers ( Rickman et al . , 2004 ) ; and abolish the ability of synaptotagmin to accelerate Ca 2 (cid:1) - independent , SNARE - mediated fusion . However , poly - lysine motif mutations do not alter postsynaptic receptor area , the size of minis ( Mackler and Reist , 2001 ) , active zone area , the Ca 2 (cid:1) cooperativity of release , the size of the hypertonic response , or the rate of endocytosis , and they do not result in synaptic vesicle depletion . These ﬁndings are discussed in terms of a single deﬁcit hypothesis , namely , disruption of Ca 2 (cid:1) - independent synaptic vesicle docking / priming ( Fig - ure 11 ) . Neither the response to a single quantum of neurotrans - mitter ( Mackler and Reist , 2001 ) nor the area occupied by the postsynaptic receptors has decreased . Therefore , the post - synaptic responsiveness is unchanged and the decrease in the evoked response must be due to a presynaptic deﬁcit ; either the size of the readily releasable pool and / or the release probability of synaptic vesicles must be decreased in the polylysine motif mutants . Because neither the area of presynaptic active zones nor the response to a hypertonic solution is decreased , the size of the readily releasable pool has not changed in the mutants . Together with the ﬁnding that facilitation , augmentation , and failure rate are increased in the mutants , these data provide strong support for the hypothesis that the polylysine motif regulates the release probability of synaptic vesicles . Of the previously hypothesized functions for the polyly - sine motif , a decrease in either Ca 2 (cid:1) - triggered fusion and / or Ca 2 (cid:1) - independent docking / priming could result in a de - crease in vesicle release probability . We discuss each possi - bility in turn below . Although a defect in Ca 2 (cid:1) - triggered fusion could result in a decrease in release probability , it cannot account for all of the deﬁcits seen in polylysine motif mutants . Ca 2 (cid:1) - depen - dent binding to negatively charged phospholipids ( PC / PS ) is reportedly unchanged by a polylysine motif mutation when a GST - pull - down assay is used ( Bai et al . , 2004 ) , sug - gesting that Ca 2 (cid:1) sensing is not disrupted by this mutation in vitro . However , recent results using a centrifugation assay and PC / PE / PS / PI ( phosphatidylinositol ) / cholesterol lipids suggest otherwise ( Li et al . , 2006 ) . In our polylysine motif mutants , the apparent Ca 2 (cid:1) afﬁnity of release has decreased , suggestive of a Ca 2 (cid:1) - sensing defect . However , the mutants exhibit their maximal response at a Ca 2 (cid:1) concentration well below the level thought to saturate Ca 2 (cid:1) channels ( Okamoto et al . , 2005 ) . Therefore , the decrease in maximal response cannot be fully accounted for by the decrease in the apparent Ca 2 (cid:1) afﬁnity . Instead , the decrease in maximal response suggests that the decrease in release probability is due to disrupted coupling between the mutant synaptotagmin and the release machinery ( Borden et al . , 2005 ) . Although dis - rupted coupling could disrupt fusion , our data demonstrate that the polylysine motif must play a role in the synaptic vesicle cycle at a step other than fusion . If the primary defect in the polylysine motif mutants were in Ca 2 (cid:1) - triggered fu - sion , then the mutants should recover from synaptic depres - sion as quickly as controls , but they do not . Recovery from depression is dramatically slower in mutants than in con - trols . Thus , the defect in the polylysine motif mutants cannot be solely in the Ca 2 (cid:1) - triggered fusion step . In contrast , a defect in Ca 2 (cid:1) - independent docking / prim - ing can account for all of the deﬁcits seen in the polylysine motif mutants , even the decrease in the apparent Ca 2 (cid:1) af - ﬁnity of release . It has been shown that negatively charged phospholipids increase the apparent Ca 2 (cid:1) afﬁnities of the C 2 domains of synaptotagmin by completing the coordination Figure 11 . Model of the role of the polylysine motif in Ca 2 (cid:1) - independent synaptic vesicle docking / priming . Nuclear magnetic resonance structures of C 2 A ( PDB ﬁle 1BYN ) and C 2 B ( PDB ﬁle 1K5W ) domains ( yellow ) of synaptotagmin , the crystal structure of the core complex ( PDB ﬁle 1SFC , containing VAMP [ blue ] , SNAP - 25 [ green ] , and syntaxin [ red ] ) , and Ca 2 (cid:1) ( pink ) are shown to scale by using the PyMOL Molecular Graphics System ( DeLano , 2002 ) . The N termini of the SNARE proteins are darker and the C termini are paler to indicate depth . The membranes , the link between C 2 A and C 2 B domains of synaptotagmin , as well as transmembrane links for synaptotagmin , VAMP , syntaxin , and SNAP - 25 were subsequently added . ( A ) Ca 2 (cid:1) - independent interactions between the polylysine motif lysines in C 2 B ( yellow , space - ﬁlled residues ) with negatively charged residues of SNAP - 25 ( green , space - ﬁlled residues ; Rickman et al . , 2004 , 2006 ) could hold the C 2 B Ca 2 (cid:1) binding site in the immediate vicinity of negatively charged phospholipids of the presynaptic membrane . ( B ) On Ca 2 (cid:1) inﬂux , Ca 2 (cid:1) - binding pockets of synaptotagmin insert into the plasma membrane ( Bai et al . , 2000 , 2002 , Wang et al . , 2003 ; Rhee et al . , 2005 ) allowing these negatively charged phospholipids to complete the coordination sphere for Ca 2 (cid:1) ( Ferna´ndez - Chaco´n et al . , 2002 ) . The opposite end of the C 2 B domain interacts with the vesicle membrane ( Arac¸ et al . , 2006 ) pulling the vesicle and plasma membranes closer together . C . A . Loewen et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 5222 spheres for Ca 2 (cid:1) ( Ferna´ndez - Chaco´n et al . , 2001 ) . It may be that the Ca 2 (cid:1) - independent interaction between the C 2 B polylysine motif and t - SNARE heterodimers primes vesicles for Ca 2 (cid:1) - triggered fusion by positioning the C 2 B Ca 2 (cid:1) - bind - ing pocket near the negatively charged phospholipids of the presynaptic membrane ( Figure 11A ) . Thus , upon Ca 2 (cid:1) in - ﬂux , these lipids are immediately at hand to complete the coordination sphere of calcium ( Figure 11B ) , thereby effec - tively increasing the afﬁnity of synaptotagmin for Ca 2 (cid:1) . It should be noted that the Ca 2 (cid:1) - independent interaction be - tween the polylysine motif and PIP 2 - containing membranes could also mediate such a function ( Bai et al . , 2004 ) . The decreased afﬁnity in the polylysine motif mutants ( Figure 3 ; Borden et al . , 2005 ; Li et al . , 2006 ) may result from the lack of a Ca 2 (cid:1) - independent interaction that normally strengthens Ca 2 (cid:1) - dependent phospholipid binding . Thus , although our data do not preclude a defect in Ca 2 (cid:1) sensing , direct disrup - tion of Ca 2 (cid:1) binding is not required to account for the decrease in Ca 2 (cid:1) afﬁnity seen in the polylysine motif mu - tants . Further evidence in support of the hypothesis that the polylysine motif mediates Ca 2 (cid:1) - independent docking / priming comes from our experiments where we monitored recovery from synaptic depression . The ability of the mu - tants to maintain neurotransmitter release during 30 s of high - frequency stimulation is less affected than their ability to recover from this synaptic depression ( Figure 7 ) . This difference may be because intracellular Ca 2 (cid:1) is higher dur - ing stimulation compared with after stimulation ( Wu and Betz , 1996 ; Karunanithi et al . , 1997 ; Suzuki et al . , 2000 ; Macleod et al . , 2002 ) . Elevated intracellular Ca 2 (cid:1) during a stimulus train is thought to accelerate the rate of recovery from synaptic depression during the train compared with the rate of recovery poststimulation ( Zucker and Regehr , 2002 ) . Our observation that the polylysine motif mutants have greater difﬁculty recovering from depression ( when intracellular Ca 2 (cid:1) levels have fallen ) than maintaining neu - rotransmitter release ( when intracellular Ca 2 (cid:1) levels are el - evated ) also indicates that the defect in these mutants is in a Ca 2 (cid:1) - independent process . This ﬁnding suggests that dur - ing the stimulus train , Ca 2 (cid:1) - dependent processes that are not impaired by the mutation may partially rescue the Ca 2 (cid:1) - independent defect . We provide direct support for the hypothesis that Ca 2 (cid:1) - independent docking / priming is impaired in polylysine motif mutants with our ﬁnding that the mutation abolished the Ca 2 (cid:1) - independent ability of synaptotagmin to accelerate the fusion of v - SNARE – containing vesicles to t - SNARE het - erodimer - containing vesicles ( Figure 6 ) . Other in vitro stud - ies also support this hypothesis . The C 2 B polylysine motif exhibits Ca 2 (cid:1) - independent interactions with t - SNARE het - erodimers ( Rickman et al . , 2004 ) , suggesting that the polyly - sine motif may dock vesicles by bringing the synaptic vesicle v - SNARE into proximity with the t - SNAREs ( Rickman et al . , 2004 , 2006 ) . Such an interaction could also prime vesicles by positioning the C 2 B Ca 2 (cid:1) - binding pocket near the presyn - aptic membrane , thereby facilitating Ca 2 (cid:1) - triggered fusion ( Figure 11 ) . Ca 2 (cid:1) - independent docking / priming by the polylysine motif could also be mediated by its Ca 2 (cid:1) - inde - pendent interaction with PIP 2 ( Bai et al . , 2004 ) , which is located predominately in the plasma membrane ( Holz et al . , 2000 ; Micheva et al . , 2001 ) . This interaction may facilitate a trans - interaction between synaptotagmin in the synaptic vesicle membrane and PIP 2 in the plasma membrane . This Ca 2 (cid:1) - independent interaction has been proposed to mediate docking / priming of vesicles because it increases the rate of Ca 2 (cid:1) - dependent penetration of synaptotagmin into lipid membranes ( Bai et al . , 2004 ) , a step thought to be important for fusion . Alternatively , a very recent report indicates that the polylysine motif does not increase the rate of vesicle fusion , but instead increases the number of vesicles capable of fusing with a fast time constant ( Li et al . , 2006 ) . This ﬁnding is consistent with the polylysine motif facilitating synaptic vesicle docking / priming . In this scenario , the poly - lysine motif mutation would result in fewer synaptic vesi - cles existing in a fully primed state . Fewer primed synaptic vesicles could explain the selective decrease in the amount of fast release ( Li et al . , 2006 ) , and the decreased release probability ( Figure 4 ; Borden et al . , 2005 ; Li et al . , 2006 ) seen in polylysine motif mutants . Furthermore , if the polylysine motif did indeed facilitate synaptic vesicle priming , then priming would be slower in its absence , and recovery from synaptic depression would be slower in polylysine motif mutants ( Figure 7 ) . Thus , disruption of either of these inter - actions ( with t - SNARE heterodimers , as indicated by Figure 6 , or with PIP 2 ) could impair Ca 2 (cid:1) - independent docking / priming while leaving many interactions proposed to medi - ate Ca 2 (cid:1) - dependent docking / priming intact ( Augustine , 2001 ) . Ultrastructural studies have demonstrated that synapto - tagmin is important for synaptic vesicle docking . In synap - totagmin null mutants , the number of morphologically docked vesicles is speciﬁcally decreased ( Reist et al . , 1998 ; Loewen et al . , 2006 ) . A detailed ultrastructural analysis would be required to determine whether the C 2 B polylysine motif participates in the function of synaptotagmin in vesi - cle docking . However , in random electron micrographs of neuromuscular junctions from transgenic controls ( Loewen et al . , 2006 ) and polylysine motif mutants ( our unpublished data ) , vesicles located immediately adjacent to the presyn - aptic membrane are common , unlike synaptotagmin null mu - tants ( Reist et al . , 1998 ; Loewen et al . , 2006 ) . In addition , because the readily releasable pool maybe correlated with the number of docked synaptic vesicles ( Rosenmund and Stevens , 1996 ; Schikorski and Stevens , 2001 ) , our observa - tion that the readily releasable pool is unchanged would be consistent with no disruption in synaptic vesicle docking . Thus , although we cannot exclude vesicle docking , it is more likely that the polylysine motif functions primarily after docking to prime vesicles for rapid , efﬁcient fusion upon the inﬂux of Ca 2 (cid:1) . The marked slowing of recovery from synaptic depression after high - frequency stimulation demonstrates that the poly - lysine motif is necessary for a membrane trafﬁcking step of the synaptic vesicle cycle in vivo . Although our in vitro data demonstrate a role for the polylysine motif in Ca 2 (cid:1) - inde - pendent docking / priming , they do not exclude additional defects such as in endocytosis . However , further analysis of our mutants ruled out a major role for the polylysine motif in synaptic vesicle endocytosis . Electrophysiological , ultra - structural , and FM 1 - 43 studies are all inconsistent with the hypothesis that the polylysine motif functions during endo - cytosis . In known endocytic mutants ( e . g . , synaptojanin and endophilin ) , evoked release during low - frequency stimula - tion is not different from controls . However , during 4 min of 10 - Hz stimulation , these mutants exhibit severe synaptic depression ( Verstreken et al . , 2002 , 2003 ) . In contrast , poly - lysine motif mutants have a signiﬁcant defect in evoked release during low frequency stimulation ( Figures 1 and 3 ; Mackler and Reist , 2001 ; Borden et al . , 2005 ; Li et al . , 2006 ) , yet they exhibit only modest if any increase in synaptic depression during 4 min of 10 - Hz stimulation ( Figure 8 ) . Thus , the electrophysiological phenotype of the polylysine motif mutants is inconsistent with an endocytic defect . C 2 B Polylysine Motif of Synaptotagmin Vol . 17 , December 2006 5223 Ultrastructural analysis of nerve terminals in endocytic mutants show severe synaptic vesicle depletion ( Koenig et al . , 1989 ; Fernandez et al . , 1998 ; Guichet et al . , 2002 ; Verstreken et al . , 2002 , 2003 ) . Indeed , syt null mutants in Dro - sophila and Caenorhabditis elegans also show severe synaptic vesicle depletion ( Figure 9 , bottom ; Jorgensen et al . , 1995 ; Reist et al . , 1998 ; Loewen et al . , 2006 ) , consistent with the role of synaptotagmin in endocytosis ( von Poser et al . , 2000 ; Jarousse and Kelly , 2001 ; Jarousse et al . , 2003 ; Poskanzer et al . , 2003 ; Llina´s et al . , 2004 ; Nicholson - Tomishima and Ryan , 2004 ) . However , nerve terminals in polylysine motif mu - tants do not exhibit synaptic vesicle depletion ( Figure 9 , middle ) . On the contrary , the polylysine motif mutant syn - aptotagmin transgene rescues the syt null ultrastructural phe - notype , again inconsistent with an endocytic defect . We directly measured the rate of synaptic vesicle internal - ization in polylysine motif mutants and controls using an FM 1 - 43 assay and found that it was not signiﬁcantly differ - ent ( Figure 10D ) . Previous studies indicate that the rate of endocytosis may decrease as more and more membrane is internalized ( Wu and Betz , 1996 ; Sankaranarayanan and Ryan , 2001 ) . Thus , the trend toward faster internalization in the polylysine motif mutants may be due to the fact that they have (cid:9) 10 % less membrane to endocytose after stimulation than do their controls ; the boutons of polylysine motif mu - tants are (cid:9) 90 % as bright as control boutons at (cid:6) t (cid:4) 0 ( Figure 10C ) . The ﬁnding that polylysine motif mutants have only (cid:9) 10 % less membrane to endocytose than controls at (cid:6) t (cid:4) 0 ( Figure 10C ) , whereas their evoked release is (cid:9) 40 % less in 5 mM Ca 2 (cid:1) ( Figure 3A ) , may seem in conﬂict with our ﬁnding that endocytosis is not disrupted . However , that endocytosis is much slower than exocytosis and our ﬁnding that the size of the readily releasable vesicle pool is similar in polylysine motif mutants and controls ( Figure 5B ) could account for this apparent discrepancy . If the strong stimulation protocol used in the dye uptake assay ( 90 mM K (cid:1) and 5 mM Ca 2 (cid:1) for 6 min ) fully mobilized the readily releasable pool in both genotypes and endocytosis were the rate limiting step , then when stimulation stopped a major fraction of the cycling membrane in both genotypes would remain incorporated in the plasma membrane awaiting endocytosis . Because evoked release is decreased in polylysine motif mutants , it is likely that for the mutants , the total time required to fully mobilize the readily releasable pool would be longer than for controls . However , if this time were (cid:5) 6 min , then at (cid:6) t (cid:4) 0 both genotypes would have fully mobilized their readily releasable pool . Because the size of this pool is similar in both genotypes ( Figure 5B ) , both would have similar amounts of vesicle membrane awaiting endocytosis at (cid:6) t (cid:4) 0 . Multiple studies have indicated a functional role for syn - aptotagmin I in synaptic vesicle endocytosis in vivo ( Figure 9 , bottom ; Jorgensen et al . , 1995 ; Reist et al . , 1998 ; Poskanzer et al . , 2003 ; Llina´s et al . , 2004 ; Nicholson - Tomishima and Ryan , 2004 ; Loewen et al . , 2006 ) . Whereas the C 2 B domain has been implicated in endocytic function of synaptotagmin ( Jarousse and Kelly , 2001 ; Littleton et al . , 2001 ; Jarousse et al . , 2003 ; Llina´s et al . , 2004 ) , our studies clearly demonstrate that the polylysine motif within the C 2 B domain is not involved . Our results do not , however , rule out a role for other motifs within the C 2 B domain of synaptotagmin in synaptic vesicle endocytosis . Indeed , the conserved WHXL motif in the C 2 B domain of synaptotagmin has been shown to be critical for internalization of synaptotagmin in PC12 cells ( Jarousse et al . , 2003 ) . Three molecular mechanisms have been proposed to me - diate the role of the polylysine motif in the synaptic vesicle cycle : 1 ) synaptic vesicle endocytosis , 2 ) regulation of Ca 2 (cid:1) - triggered fusion , and 3 ) Ca 2 (cid:1) - independent docking and / or priming of synaptic vesicles . Our data demonstrate that the polylysine motif mutation decreases the release probability of synaptic vesicles . Electron micrographs show that the polylysine motif mutant larvae do not exhibit synaptic ves - icle depletion and an FM 1 - 43 assay demonstrates that the rate of endocytosis is not impaired in these mutants . The mutant larvae maintain release relatively well during high - frequency stimulation when Ca 2 (cid:1) levels are elevated . How - ever , they are slow to recover from synaptic depression , when intracellular Ca 2 (cid:1) levels are low , indicating that a Ca 2 (cid:1) - independent process is likely disrupted in these lar - vae . The decreased probability of release observed in poly - lysine motif mutants , coupled with their slow rate of recov - ery from depression , is consistent with the hypothesis that Ca 2 (cid:1) - independent docking / priming of synaptic vesicles is disrupted in these mutants . The fact that the polylysine mutation abolished the ability of synaptotagmin to acceler - ate Ca 2 (cid:1) - independent , SNARE - mediated fusion provides direct support for this hypothesis . Thus , we propose that the major role of the polylysine motif of synaptotagmin during the synaptic vesicle cycle in vivo is to facilitate Ca 2 (cid:1) - inde - pendent priming of synaptic vesicles at release sites .
