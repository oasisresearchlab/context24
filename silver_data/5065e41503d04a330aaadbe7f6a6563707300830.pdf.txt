Ank1 ankyrin repeats associate with the Myo1 lever arm and Ank1 acidic tail binds the Myo1 TH1 domain to inhibit Myo1 membrane binding . Ank1 orthologs exists in budding yeast ( Ank1 ) and humans ( OSTF1 ) . 2 Abstract Myosin - 1s are monomeric actin - based motors that function at membranes . Myo1 is the single myosin - 1 isoform in Schizosaccharomyces pombe that works redundantly with Wsp1 - Vrp1 to activate the Arp2 / 3 complex for endocytosis . Here , we identified Ank1 as an uncharacterized cytoplasmic Myo1 binding partner . We found that in ank1Δ cells , Myo1 dramatically redistributed from endocytic patches to decorate the entire plasma membrane and endocytosis was defective . Biochemical analysis and structural predictions suggested that the Ank1 ankyrin repeats bind the Myo1 lever arm and the Ank1 acidic tail binds the Myo1 TH1 domain to prevent TH1 - dependent Myo1 membrane binding . Indeed , Ank1 over - expression precluded Myo1 membrane localization and recombinant Ank1 blocked purified Myo1 liposome binding in vitro . Based on biochemical and cell biology analyses , we propose budding yeast Ank1 and human OSTF1 are functional Ank1 orthologs and that cytoplasmic sequestration by small ankyrin repeat proteins is a conserved mechanism regulating myosin - 1s in endocytosis . 3 Introduction Type I myosins are actin binding proteins that link membrane to F - actin to support cellular shape changes . Myosin - Is are characterized by an N - terminal motor domain , a neck region , and a tail region of varying length and composition . The long - tailed subclass of myosin - 1s is found in many eukaryotes ( Lee et al . , 2000 ; Sirotkin et al . , 2005 ) and contain extended C - terminal tails that mediate protein - protein interactions , membrane binding , and / or actin binding . The single type I myosin present in Schizosaccharomyces pombe , Myo1 , belongs to the long - tailed subclass and localizes to actin patches which assemble at sites of endocytosis ( Lee et al . , 2000 ) . Myo1 contains an N - terminal motor domain followed by a lever arm containing two IQ motifs that bind the calmodulin - related light chains Cam1 and Cam2 ( Toya et al . , 2001 ; Sammons et al . , 2011 ) . The C - terminus includes a tail homology 1 ( TH1 ) , a tail homology 2 ( TH2 ) , a src homology 3 ( SH3 ) and a central - acidic ( CA ) domain . The CA domain binds and activates Arp2 / 3 ( Lee et al . , 2000 ; Sirotkin et al . , 2005 ) . However , Myo1 - dependent activation of Arp2 / 3 is dispensable for endocytosis ( MacQuarrie et al . , 2019 ; Sun et al . , 2019 ) and mammalian orthologs , such as the human Myo1e , do not contain CA domains . Additional roles at sites of endocytosis are proposed such as generating force for internalization and / or tethering actin - based processes to the membrane ( Sirotkin et al . , 2005 ; Berro et al . , 2010 ; Basu et al . , 2014 ; Lewellyn et al . , 2015 ; Sun et al . , 2019 ) . Saccharomyces cerevisiae myosin - 1 motor mutants have altered endocytic patch lifetimes ( Lewellyn et al . , 2015 ; Manenschijn et al . , 2019 ; Sun et al . , 2019 ) , suggesting that Myo1 motor activity is important for its function . In addition , both motor function and TH1 domain membrane binding are required for proper endocytosis ( Lewellyn et al . , 2015 ; Pedersen and Drubin , 2019 ) . Intriguingly , the majority of both yeast and human long - tailed myosin - 1s are found in the cytoplasm ( Sirotkin et al . , 2010 ; Tanimura et al . , 2016 ; Manenschijn et al . , 2019 ) but how myosin - 1 membrane localization is controlled is unknown . Here , we identified a previously uncharacterized protein , Ank1 , in a Myo1 - GFP purification . The ankyrin repeats of Ank1 bind a conserved lever arm residue in Myo1 4 and the Ank1 acidic tail extends to also bind the Myo1 TH1 domain . This cytoplasmic complex precludes Myo1 from membrane binding and cells lacking this mode of regulation have non - specific Myo1 membrane localization and endocytic defects . An Ank1 ortholog is also present in budding yeast that regulates the localization of both long - tailed myosin - 1s , Myo3 and Myo5 . Lastly , the human Ank1 ortholog , OSTF1 , controls Myo1e localization to endocytic sites in cultured cells indicating that this mechanism of long - tailed myosin - 1 regulation is conserved . Results and Discussion The uncharacterized S . pombe protein encoded by SPAC105 . 02c was identified by mass spectrometry in affinity purifications of Myo1 - GFP along with known Myo1 associated proteins including the calmodulin - like light chains Cam1 and Cam2 , WIP homolog Bbc1 , F - BAR protein Cdc15 , verprolin homolog Vrp1 and WASp homolog Wsp1 ( Fig . 1A ) ( Toya et al . , 2001 ; Carnahan and Gould , 2003 ; Sirotkin et al . , 2005 ; Sammons et al . , 2011 ; MacQuarrie et al . , 2019 ) . The SPAC105 . 02c ORF encodes a predicted 18 kDa protein containing three ankyrin repeats and an acidic tail that we named Ank1 ( Ankyrin repeat - protein 1 ) . The Myo1 - Ank1 association was validated by co - immunoprecipitation ( Fig . 1B ) . Cam1 and Cam2 also co - immunoprecipitated with Ank1 , dependent on Myo1 ( Fig . S1A - B ) . Thus , we investigated Ank1’s potential relationship to Myo1 function . In wildtype cells , Myo1 - GFP localized to endocytic actin patches enriched at the cell tips and cell division site , as previously described ( Lee et al . , 2000 ; Sirotkin et al . , 2005 ) . In ank1Δ cells , Myo1 - GFP was instead localized uniformly along the plasma membrane ( PM ) ( Fig . 1C ) . Because Cam1 and Cam2 directly bind the Myo1 IQ motifs ( Toya et al . , 2001 ; Sammons et al . , 2011 ) and co - immunoprecipitate with Ank1 , their localization was also analyzed . Like Myo1 - GFP , mNG - Cam1 and Cam2 - mNG localized to actin patches in wildtype cells , as previously shown ( Sammons et al . , 2011 ) , but like Myo1 , they were also mis - localized along the PM in ank1Δ cells ( Fig . 1C ) . mNG - Cam1 also localizes to the cytokinetic ring and spindle pole bodies ( SPBs ) ( Moser et al . , 1997 ; Eng et al . , 1998 ) , and these localizations are unchanged in ank1Δ cells ( Fig . 1C ) . F - actin visualized with LifeAct - mCherry and Fim1 - mNG localized in patches in wildtype 5 and ank1Δ cells indicating that actin patches are present in ank1Δ cells ( Fig . 1C ) . Interestingly , although Vrp1 and Wsp1 directly or indirectly associate with Myo1’s C - terminus , respectively ( Carnahan and Gould , 2003 ; Sirotkin et al . , 2005 ; MacQuarrie et al . , 2019 ) , they localized to patches in both wildtype and ank1Δ cells ( Fig . S1C ) . Thus , Ank1 specifically controls myosin - 1 localization . To investigate if Ank1 impacts Myo1 function in endocytosis , we analyzed wildtype and ank1∆ cells expressing Fim1 - mNG . Whereas > 95 % of Fim1 - mNG patches internalized in wildtype cells , as expected ( Barger et al . , 2019 ) , only 65 % of patches internalized in ank1∆ cells ( Fig . 1C - D ) . Genetic analysis revealed that ank1Δ was synthetically lethal with wsp1Δ ( Fig . 1E ) and synthetically sick with vrp1Δ , as previously noted ( Ryan et al . , 2012 ) , and was also synthetically sick with arp3 - C1 ( Fig . S1D ) ( McCollum et al . , 1996 ) . We did not detect a significant genetic interaction between ank1Δ and myo1Δ , consistent with ank1 functioning in the same genetic pathway as myo1 ( Fig . S1D ) . These results implicate Ank1 in promoting Myo1 function in endocytosis . Because Ank1 co - purified with Myo1 , is required for proper Myo1 localization and plays a role in endocytosis , we investigated Ank1’s localization . Unexpectedly , Ank1 - GFP localized diffusely in the cytoplasm and did not apparently co - localize with Myo1 - mCherry at actin patches ( Fig . 1F ) . However , when Ank1 - GFP was targeted to the SPB via Ppc89 - GBP ( Rothbauer et al . , 2008 ) , Myo1 - mCherry was recruited to the SPB ( Fig . 1F and S1E ) . Taken together , these data support an association between Ank1 with Myo1 and suggest that Ank1 may interact with a pool of Myo1 that is cytoplasmic , an intriguing possibility given 84 % of the Myo1 protein is in the cytoplasm ( Sirotkin et al . , 2010 ) . To further investigate the nature of the Ank1 - Myo1 interaction , we performed immunoprecipitations of Myo1 C - terminal truncations ( Lee et al . , 2000 ) and assayed if Ank1 co - purified . Myo1 lacking the CA [ Myo1Δ ( 1 - 1165 ) ] , CA and SH3 [ Myo1Δ ( 1 - 1102 ) ] , or CA , SH3 and TH2 domains [ Myo1Δ ( 1 - 964 ) ] still associated with Ank1 - GFP ( Fig . S1F ) . In fact , we found that a fragment containing only the motor domain and IQ motifs [ Myo1 ( 1 - 772 ) ] or a shorter fragment containing the motor domain and the first few 6 residues of the lever arm ( but not the IQ motifs ) [ Myo1 ( 1 - 721 ) ] also still associated with Ank1 ( Fig . 2A - B ) . In accord , Myo1Δ ( 1 - 772 ) - mNG localized to endocytic patches in wildtype cells but in ank1Δ cells , Myo1Δ ( 1 - 772 ) - mNG localized along the PM ( Fig . 2C ) , consistent with the Myo1 C - terminal domains being dispensable for Ank1 interaction . To test for direct binding between Ank1 and Myo1 , we co - produced a fragment of Myo1 containing the motor domain , lever arm and TH1 domain tagged with FLAG 3 [ Myo1 ( 1 - 964 ) - FLAG 3 ] with Cam1 and Cam2 in Sf9 cells and purified the complex . We also purified His 6 - Ank1 from bacteria and removed the tag . The Myo1 - Cam1 - Cam2 complex bound Ank1 , supporting a direct interaction between Myo1 and Ank1 ( Fig . 2D ) . To gather more information about how Ank1 and Myo1 may associate , we employed AlphaFold2 ( AF ) to model their interaction ( Jumper et al . , 2021 ; Mirdita et al . , 2022 ; Varadi et al . , 2022 ) . AF predicted that the ankyrin repeats of Ank1 are positioned at the back of the Myo1 motor domain , opposite from the actin binding cleft , where the lever arm extends ( Fig . 2A and E ) . In addition , the Ank1 acidic tail was predicted to extend away from the ankyrin repeats and bind the Myo1 TH1 domain ( Fig . 2E ) . The myosin - 1 TH1 domain is an extended pleckstrin homology domain ( Hokanson et al . , 2006 ) and typical membrane binding loops ( β1 / β2 and β3 / β4 ) ( Cronin et al . , 2004 ; Hokanson et al . , 2006 ; Feeser et al . , 2010 ; Brzeska et al . , 2020 ) is where the Ank1 acidic tail is predicted to associate ( Fig . 2E ) . Given the AF model and the above results , we hypothesized that Ank1 precludes Myo1 membrane binding and sequesters the myosin - 1 complex in the cytoplasm ( Fig . 2F ) . We next tested if Myo1 membrane binding is controlled by Ank1 in vitro . As expected , a portion of Myo1 ( 1 - 964 ) - FLAG 3 - Cam1 - Cam2 co - pelleted with liposomes made from Folch fraction lipids ( Fig . 2F ) . Addition of Ank1 resulted in a reduction in the amount of co - pelleting of the Myo1 ( 1 - 964 ) - FLAG 3 - Cam1 - Cam2 complex with liposomes ( Fig . 2F ) . We therefore conclude that Ank1 directly binds and inhibits Myo1 membrane binding , supporting our model . Based on the above results , we predicted that Ank1 overexpression would result in increased cytoplasmic Myo1 . In control myo1 - mNG fim1 - mCherry cells , Myo1 - mNG and Fim1 - mCherry both localized at actin patches ( Fig . 3A ) . In contrast , in myo1 - mNG 7 fim1 - mCherry cells overproducing Ank1 , while Fim1 - mCherry was at patches , almost all Myo1 - mNG was cytoplasmic ( Fig . 3A ) . These data support our model that Ank1 blocks Myo1 membrane association and normally sequesters the bulk of Myo1 in the cytoplasm . Consistent with this conclusion , it was previously shown that overexpressed GFP - Myo1 localized along the entire PM ( Lee et al . , 2000 ; Attanapola et al . , 2009 ) , as would be predicted if there was an excess of Myo1 over available Ank1 . Furthermore , in cells overproducing ank1 + , ~ 10 % of Fim1 - mCherry patches internalized compared to ~ 95 % of Fim1 - mCherry patches internalized in the control cells ( Fig . 3B ) . These data illustrate the importance of proper regulation of Myo1 membrane localization during endocytosis . We next used the AF generated model to inform Ank1 structure - function analysis . AF predicted that Ank1 R17 within the ankyrin repeats binds to Myo1 E710 within the lever arm ( Fig . 2D ) . We therefore constructed an ank1 allele in which R17 was substituted with glutamate ( ank1 - R17E ) to test whether this would disrupt the Myo1 - Ank1 interaction . Indeed , Ank1 - R17E - GFP did not co - immunoprecipitate with Myo1 - myc 13 ( Fig . 3C ) . Further , Myo1 - mCherry localized along the PM in ank1 - R17E - GFP cells indicating it is a non - functional ank1 allele ( Fig . 3D ) . In addition , ank1 - R17E displayed endocytic defects compared to wildtype with only 70 % of the Fim1 - mNG patches internalizing ( Fig . 3E ) . We conclude that Ank1 R17 is a key residue for binding Myo1 . We next explored the function of the Ank1 acidic tail that AF predicted bound the Myo1 TH1 domain ( Fig . 2D ) . We removed it by adding sequences encoding GFP at the ank1 endogenous locus to construct the ank1Δ ( 1 - 155 ) - GFP strain ( Fig . 2A ) . Immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that Ank1Δ ( 1 - 155 ) - GFP still bound Myo1 - myc 13 but reproducibly less well ( Fig . 3C ) . That the Ank1 acidic tail is not required for Myo1 interaction is consistent with our previous experiment demonstrating that the Myo1 TH1 domain is dispensable for Ank1 co - immunoprecipitation ( Fig . 2B ) . In ank1Δ ( 1 - 155 ) - GFP cells , Myo1 - mCherry was redistributed all along the PM in a manner indistinguishable from its localization in ank1∆ ( Fig . 3B ) . ank1Δ ( 1 - 155 ) - GFP cells also displayed endocytic defects with only 70 % of Fim1 - mNG puncta internalizing ( Fig . 3E ) . 8 We also assayed the overproduction of Ank1Δ ( 1 - 155 ) in Myo1 - GFP cells . Overproduced Ank1Δ ( 1 - 155 ) resulted in Myo1 - GFP localizing along the entire PM ( Fig . 3F ) . We interpret these findings to indicate that overproduced Ank1Δ ( 1 - 155 ) can out - compete endogenous Ank1 for binding to Myo1 - GFP , but Ank1Δ ( 1 - 155 ) cannot inhibit Myo1’s membrane association , thus resulting in a dominant negative effect . Overall , we conclude that the Ank1 acidic tail negatively regulates Myo1 membrane association . Because Ank1 appears to be an important Myo1 regulator , we postulated that this mode of control likely exists in other organisms . Indeed , a predicted Ank1 ortholog is encoded by the ORF YGL242C in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and we named it Ank1 ( Fig . S2A ) . Large - scale screens found that Ank1 co - purified with both budding yeast myosin - 1s , Myo3 and Myo5 , and calmodulin Cmd1 ( Krogan et al . , 2006 ) , and that ank1Δ has negative genetic interactions with vrp1Δ , las17Δ ( WASp ortholog ) and arp2 - 14 ( Costanzo et al . , 2016 ) . We determined that Ank1 - mNG is cytoplasmic and does not apparently co - localize with Myo3 - mCherry at actin patches ( Fig . S2B ) . In addition , while both Myo3 - mNG and Myo5 - mNG localize to endocytic patches in wildtype cells ( Sun et al . , 2006 ) , a portion of the myosin - 1s were redistributed along the PM in ank1Δ cells ( Fig . S2C ) . AF also predicted an interaction between Ank1 and Myo3 or Myo5 in a similar arrangement to Ank1 - Myo1 ( Fig . S2D ) . These data indicate that fission and budding yeast Ank1 proteins are likely orthologs . The budding and fission yeast myosin - 1s belong to the long - tailed subclass , a group that is conserved in humans ( Myo1e and Myo1f ) . Thus , we explored if Ank1 orthologs exist beyond yeast . One of the top co - purifying proteins with both human Myo1e and Myo1f was OSTF1 ( SH3P2 in mice ) , a protein with three ankyrin repeats , an acidic tail , an N - terminal proline rich region ( PRR ) and an SH3 domain ( Tanimura et al . , 2016 ; Huttlin et al . , 2017 , 2021 ; Cho et al . , 2022 ) ( Fig . 4A ) . Interestingly , it was previously found that OSTF1 and Myo1e interact via two interfaces : the OSTF1 PRR binds the Myo1e SH3 domain and the OSTF1 acidic tail binds the Myo1e TH2 domain ( Tanimura et al . , 2016 ) . Intriguingly , in humans and mice , OSTF1 is cytoplasmic and it interacts with Myo1e in the cytoplasm ( Tanimura et al . , 2016 ; Nakamura et al . , 2020 ) . In addition , Myo1e at lamellipodia is also controlled by OSTF1 ; OSTF1 depletion leads to 9 increased membrane - bound Myo1e and overexpression of OSTF1 results in cytoplasmic Myo1e ( Tanimura et al . , 2016 ) . Because of the striking similarities between OSTF1 and Ank1 in domain structure and function , we used AF to explore if OSTF1 may associate with the Myo1e lever arm and TH1 domain as in the Ank1 - Myo1 interaction . AF predicted a multivalent interaction with three interfaces . The first predicted interaction was the previously mapped Myo1e SH3 domain binding to the PRR of OSTF1 ( Fig . 4B ) ( Tanimura et al . , 2016 ) . The second predicted interaction was the OSTF1 ankyrin repeats binding near the Myo1e motor domain and lever arm , an interaction not previously reported ( Fig . 4B ) . Lastly , the OSTF1 acidic tail was predicted to bind the Myo1e TH1 domain , and this interaction was not previously noted ( Fig . 4B ) . AF did not predict the reported association between the OSTF1 acidic tail and the Myo1e TH2 domain ( Tanimura et al . , 2016 ) . Instead , unlike in the Ank1 - Myo1 case , AF predicted that the unstructured TH2 domain wraps around the Myo1e motor domain to accommodate the C - terminal Myo1e SH3 domain - OSTF1 PRR interaction ( Fig . 4B ) . Because of the similarities in predicted structure and that over - or under - expression of OSTF1 modulates Myo1e membrane association ( Tanimura et al . , 2016 ; Nakamura et al . , 2020 ) , we hypothesized that these proteins interact in a manner analogous to Ank1 - Myo1 to inhibit membrane association of Myo1e and Myo1f . We therefore investigated if the residues involved in Ank1 - Myo1 interaction are conserved . The Myo1 glutamate ( E710 ) that is predicted to mediate Ank1 binding is present in all long - tailed isoforms of budding yeast , fission yeast and humans ( Fig . 4C ) . Interestingly , this residue is positively charged or absent in all human short - tailed myosin - 1s and all other fission yeast myosins ( Fig . 4C ) . The Ank1 R17 residue necessary for Myo1 interaction is conserved as an arginine or lysine in all Ank1 orthologs identified ( Fig . 4D ) . Lastly , each Ank1 ortholog contains a C - terminal acidic tail of varying length ( Fig . 4D ) . Thus , the Ank1 - Myo1 interaction interfaces appear to be conserved . Depending on the cell type , Myo1e can localizes to a variety of actin structures including lamellipodia , podosomes and sites of endocytosis ( Cheng et al . , 2012 ; Tanimura et al . , 2016 ; Zhang et al . , 2019 ) . However , OSTF1 - dependent control of Myo1e localization has only been demonstrated at lamellipodia ( Tanimura et al . , 2016 ) . To investigate if OSTF1 controls Myo1e endocytic localization we used CRISPR / Cas9 - 10 mediated gene editing to insert sequences encoding mNG at the C - terminus of endogenous MYO1E in HeLa cells ( Fig . 5A ) . Correct insertion of the tag was verified by PCR and immunoblotting ( Fig . 5A - C ) . Myo1e - mNG localized to PM puncta in fixed and live cells visualized by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy ( TIRFM ) ( Fig . 5D - E ) . The Myo1e - mNG PM puncta represented endocytic sites as they colocalized with fluorescently labeled transferrin ( Fig . 5D ) and Myo1e membrane puncta were shown previously to be endocytic sites ( Cheng et al . , 2012 ) . Myo1e - mNG cells were transfected with plasmids expressing mCherry or OSTF1 - mCherry . In cells overexpressing mCherry , Myo1e - mNG localized to PM puncta normally ( Fig . 5E ) . In contrast , in cells overexpressing OSTF1 - mCherry , Myo1e - mNG PM puncta were not detected and the signal was instead diffuse ( Fig . 5E ) . Thus , OSTF1 negatively regulates Myo1e localization to sites of endocytosis and likely represents an Ank1 ortholog . Over - production of Ank1 or OSTF1 resulted in a redistribution of the corresponding myosin - 1 from endocytic sites to the cytoplasm ( Fig . 5F ) . This suggests that , in addition to inhibiting membrane binding , myosin - 1 F - actin binding and / or motor activity may also be inhibited by Ank1 / OSTF1 . Given where the ankyrin repeats are predicted to bind myosin - 1 , it is possible that the myosin - 1 ATPase cycle is negatively impacted and / or the lever arm is physically constrained . Future studies are required to understand how , in addition to membrane binding , myosin - 1 activities are controlled by Ank1 / OSTF1 . Conversely , ank1 deletion results in a milder endocytic defect compared to myo1Δ ( Basu et al . , 2014 ; Barger et al . , 2019 ) . In ank1Δ cells , myosin - 1 is uniformly distributed along the PM but not specifically concentrated at sites of endocytosis ( Fig . 5F ) . Therefore , when an actin patch forms , a fraction of myosin - 1 may be available to promote endocytosis , potentially explaining the relatively mild ank1∆ endocytic defect . The precise role of myosin - 1s in endocytosis is still not fully understood . One model proposes that myosin - 1 motors translocate F - actin away from the PM to facilitate monomer addition at barbed ends and growth of the F - actin network ( Manenschijn et al . , 2019 ) . By preventing spurious PM localization , Ank1 / OSTF1 may promote the local accumulation of myosin - 1 at endocytic sites . 11 One remaining question is how the Ank1 / OSTF1 - myosin - 1 associations are controlled to ensure the proper balance of myosin - 1 at membranes and in the cytoplasm . Several regulatory mechanisms have been proposed for OSTF1 . First , OSTF1 is phosphorylated by ERK on S202 to control its association with Myo1e ( Tanimura et al . , 2016 ) . Fission yeast Ank1 phosphorylation sites are reported ( Swaffer et al . , 2018 ) , but none are analogous to S202 or in proximity to the predicted interaction interfaces . OSTF1 also has additional binding partners , one of which , RP2 , is proposed to regulate the subcellular localization of OSTF1 and its ability to bind and regulate Myo1e ( Lyraki et al . , 2018 ) . Further studies will be needed to elucidate the full set of regulatory mechanisms affecting Ank1 / OSTF1 - myosin - 1 complex formation . Although OSTF1 and Ank1 have many similarities in function and protein structure , OSTF1 contains additional N - terminal domains that are not found in the yeast orthologs . One of these , the PRR , binds the Myo1e SH3 domain which is predicted to result in the unstructured TH2 domain of Myo1e looping around the motor domain . The TH2 domain also contributes to Myo1e membrane binding ( Zhang et al . , 2019 ) . Thus , interaction between the OSTF1 PRR and the Myo1e SH3 domain may preclude TH2 from associating with the PM . How exactly each interaction interface influences myosin - 1 function will be interesting to explore further . Materials and Methods Yeast methods All S . pombe strains used in this study ( Table S1 ) were cultured using standard methods in YE media or Edinburgh minimal media plus selective supplements ( Moreno et al . , 1991 ; Forsburg and Rhind , 2006 ) . All budding yeast strains used in this study ( Table S1 ) were derived from wildtype diploid S288C and cultured in YPD using standard methods . Transformation of yeast with plasmid or linear DNA was accomplished using electroporation ( Forsburg and Rhind , 2006 ) and lithium acetate methods ( Keeney and Boeke , 1994 ; Forsburg and Rhind , 2006 ) , respectively . Strain construction was accomplished through tetrad analysis using standard methods . Tagged strains were generated by endogenously tagging the 3′ end of ORFs with 12 sequences encoding the appropriate epitope tag or fluorescent protein and / or resistance or auxotrophic selection cassette ( kanMX6 , natMX6 , or hphMX6 ) using pFA6 cassettes as previously described ( Wach et al . , 1994 ; Bähler et al . , 1998 ) . G418 ( Geneticin , 100 mg / mL , Thermo Fisher Scientific ; cat # 11811031 ) , hygromycin B ( 50 mg / mL , Life Technologies Cat # 10687010 ) , or nourseothiricin ( clonNAT , 100 mg / mL , GoldBio ; cat # N - 500 - 100 ) were used for selection of kanMX6 , natMX6 , or hphMX6 cells , respectively . All fusion proteins were expressed from their native promoters at their chromosomal loci . The ank1Δ : : ura4 + allele was constructed by performing a marker swap from the ank1 : : kanMX6 strain ( Bioneer ) . The ank1 gene was amplified from genomic DNA with 300bp flanking regions by PCR and cloned into BamHI / PstI sites in pIRT2 by Gibson assembly . The ank1 - R17E allele was created by site - directed mutagenesis and sequenced to confirm . To integrate the ank1 - R17E allele into the genome , a haploid ank1Δ : : ura4 + strain was transformed with pIRT2 - ank1 - R17E and selected on minimal media lacking leucine . Colonies were then grown up in YE and plated on YE plates containing 1 . 5 mg / mL of 5 - fluoroorotic acid ( United States Biological ; cat # F5050 ) . Integrants were validated by colony PCR and all constructs and integrants were sequenced to ensure their accuracy . Overexpression of Ank1 was accomplished by using the repressible nmt1 promoter in pREP1 . 1 μg of pREP1 , pREP1 - ank1 + and pREP1 - ank1Δ ( 1 - 155 ) were transformed into myo1 - mNG fim1 - mCherry or myo1 - GFP strains by electroporation and plated in medium containing 5 μg / mL thiamine . Cells were then grown in liquid media in the presence of thiamine before being washed into medium lacking thiamine for 24 h to induce overexpression . DNA constructs All cloning was performed by Gibson Assembly . The pSK - mNG - cam1 : kanMX6 construct to make the mNG - Cam1 strain was made by cloning the cam1 5’ flank , mNG and cam1 coding sequence into the NotI / BamHI restriction sites in pSK . Then the sequences encoding kan R and cam1 3’ flank were cloned into BamHI / KpnI . ank1 + was amplified from cDNA and cloned into pREP1 and pET15b at the NdeI / BamHI . 13 The cam1 + coding sequence was cloned into the KpnI / XhoI sites of pFastBac - Dual ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ; 10712024 ) . The cam2 + coding sequence was then cloned into the BamHI / SacI sites . In addition , the sequence encoding Myo1 ( 1 - 964 ) - FLAG 3 was synthesized in a gene block ( Integrated DNA Technologies ) and codon optimized for expression in Sf9 cells and cloned into the BamHI / SacI sites in pFastBac - Dual . The ank1 + sequence was cloned in the KpnI / XhoI sites . pcDNA - OSTF1 - mCherry were made by amplifying OSTF1 cDNA from an ORF clone ( Sino Biological ; cat # HG20537 - U ) and cloned into the BamHI / EcoRI sites in pcDNA . mCherry was cloned into the EcoRI site of pcDNA . Cell culture and gene editing HeLa cells ( TKG cat # TKG 0331 , RRID : CVCL _ 0030 ) were cultured in Dulbeco’s modified eagle medium ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ; cat # 11965092 ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( Fisher Scientific ; cat # 50 - 152 - 7066 ) and 1 % penicillin / streptomycin ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ; cat # 15140122 ) . Cells were plated on glass bottom dishes ( MatTek ; cat # P35G - 1 . 5 - 20 - C ) before transfection with pcDNA - mCherry or pcDNA - OSTF1 - mCherry constructs using lipofectamine 3000 reagent ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ; cat # L3000001 ) . HeLa cells were fixed with 3 . 5 % PFA for 15 min at RT . Cells were washed with TBS - BSA and then incubated with TBS - BSA and 20 μg / mL Alexa 594 - conjugated human transferrin ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ; cat # T13343 ) for 1h at RT . Coverslips were washed with TBS - BSA and then mounted on slides using Prolong Diamond antifade mounting media ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ; cat # P36961 ) . For CRISPR / Cas9 gene editing , guide RNAs ( gRNA ) were designed using the “design custom gRNA” tool from Integrated DNA Technologies ( IDT ) website ( https : / / www . idtdna . com / site / order / designtool / index / CRISPR _ CUSTOM ) . Three gRNAs were chosen based on high on - target and off - target scores . Single guide RNA ( sgRNA ) containing the gRNA , crRNA , and trans - activating crRNA were synthesized by Synthego Corporation . Tagging MYO1E with mNG by CRISPR - mediated gene - editing was performed as described ( Paix et al . , 2017 ) with modifications . Neon transfection 14 system ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ; cat # MPK1025 ) was used for introduction of sgRNA / Cas9 RNP complex into cells . Briefly , 0 . 5 μL of 15 μM sgRNAs were mixed with 0 . 5 μL of 15 μM Alt - R HiFi - Cas9 ( IDT ) in Neon transfection resuspension buffer R ( total volume 5 μL ) and incubated for 10 min at RT , followed by adding 0 . 5 μL of 2 . 8 μM repair template , which is purified PCR product of mNG with 35 bp homologous sequences to either ends of MYO1E stop codon . The preformed RNP complex were delivered into 5x10 4 HeLa cells by electroporation with Neon transfection system using 10 μL Neon tips per manufacturer’s instructions under the condition of voltage 1005 V , width 35 ms and pulse number 2 , and the electroporated cells were cultured in 500 μL antibiotics free medium in the presence of 1 μM HDR enhance ( IDT ) in 24 - well plates . Medium was replaced with regular growth medium after 24 h . Three days after electroporation , green positive cells were sorted into single cells in 96 - well plates through the Vanderbilt Flow Cytometry core facility . Clones were validated by whole cell PCR amplification of a fragment between 200 bp upstream and 500 bp downstream of MYO1E stop codon ( with a product of 1 . 4 kb suggesting successfully tagged clone and that of 700 bp for untagged clone ) . Edited clones were further verified by Sanger DNA sequencing . Correct edits were also verified by western blotting of whole cell lysate . Microscopy Yeast cells were grown at 25°C prior to live - cell imaging unless otherwise stated . All fission yeast imaging was performed in YE media , except for figures 3A and 3F which were imaged in minimal media supplemented with adenine , uracil and leucine . Budding yeast strains from Figure S2 were grown up in YPD and washed with water prior to imaging . Images of yeast and HeLa cells were acquired with a Personal DeltaVision microscope system ( Leica Microsystems ) that includes an Olympus IX71 microscope , 60X 1 . 42 NA PlanApo oil immersion objective , a 60X 1 . 49 TIRF objective , a pco . edge sCMOS camera , and softWoRx imaging software . TIRF mNG images were acquired with a Sapphire LP 50 25 mW 488 laser ( Coherent ) . Images in figures are deconvolved maximum intensity projections of z sections spaced at 0 . 5 µm unless otherwise indicated . Quantification of images was performed using Fiji ( a version of ImageJ software available at https : / / fiji . sc ) ( Schindelin et al . , 2012 ) . Percent actin patch 15 internalization was measured by acquiring 40 - 60s movies with a 1s interval focused at the medial z plan of the cell as determined by the DIC channel . Patches were followed over a 20 - second time period in at least 8 cells . Internalization was considered successful if the patch moved at least 2 pixels from the cell membrane . For live - cell imaging of HeLa cells the environmental chamber was set to 37 °C with 5 % CO 2 . Biochemistry methods Yeast cell pellets ( 30 OD ) were snap frozen and lysed by bead disruption using a FastPrep - 24 cell homogenizer ( MP Biomedicals ; cat # 116004500 ) for 20s in NP - 40 lysis buffer ( 6 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 4 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 1 % NP - 40 , 150 mM NaCl , 50 mM NaF , 4 μg / ml leupeptin , 0 . 1 mM Na 3 VO 4 ) ( Gould et al . , 1991 ) with the addition of 1 mM PMSF , 2 mM benzamidine and protease inhibitor cocktail ( Sigma - Aldrich ; cat # 11697498001 ) . Buffer modifications were made for the following figures : Figure S1A used NP - 40 lysis buffer with 2 mM EGTA and Figure 3C used NP - 40 lysis buffer with 300 mM NaCl . For immunoprecipitation , 5 µL of GFP - TRAP magnetic beads ( Proteintech ; cat # gtma ) or mNG - TRAP magnetic beads ( Proteintech ; cat # ntma ) were added to cleared cell lysates , then beads were washed 3 times with NP - 40 buffer and proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer . Proteins were separated on 12 % , 10 % , 6 % Tris - glycine or NuPAGE 4 - 12 % Bis - Tris gels ( Invitrogen ; cat # NP0321BOX ) and transferred to Immobilon - P PVDF membranes ( Millipore Sigma ; cat # IPVH00005 ) and immunoblotted with 12CA5 anti - myc ( Vanderbilt Antibody and Protein Resource Core ) ( 1 : 1000 ) , anti - GFP ( Sigma - Aldrich ; cat # 11814460001 , RRID : AB _ 390913 ) ( 1 : 1000 ) , anti - RFP ( Proteintech ; cat # 67378 - 1 - Ig , RRID : AB _ 2882625 ) ( 1 : 1000 ) or ( ChromoTek Cat # 6g6 - 100 , RRID : AB _ 2631395 ) ( 1 : 2000 ) , anti - mNG ( Vanderbilt Antibody and Protein Resource Core , VU527 ) ( 1 : 1000 ) or anti - ɑ - tubulin ( Sigma - Aldrich Cat # T5168 , RRID : AB _ 477579 ) ( 1 : 5000 ) followed by secondary antibodies conjugated to IRDye 680 or IRDye 800 ( LI - COR Biosciences ) ( 1 : 10000 ) and imaged with an Odyssey CLx instrument ( LI - COR Biosciences ) .

For immunoblotting , whole cell lysate was resolved by SDS - PAGE on a 6 or 12 % gel and transferred by electroblotting to PVDF membrane . Proteins were detected with anti - ɑ - tubulin ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ; cat # MA1 - 80017 , RRID : AB _ 2210201 ) or anti - Myo1e ( Sigma - Aldrich ; cat # HPA023886 , RRID : AB _ 1854253 ) . Immunoblots were Imaged with an Odyssey instrument . Protein expression and purification Rosetta2 ( DE3 ) pLysS bacteria cells were grown in Terrific Broth media ( 23 . 6 g / L Yeast Extract , 11 . 8 g / L tryptone , 9 . 4 g / L K 2 HPO 4 , 2 . 2 g / L KH 2 PO 4 , 4 mL / L glycerol ) with appropriate antibiotics to log - phase ( OD 595 1 – 1 . 5 ) at 36°C . Cells were incubated on ice for 15 min and protein expression was initiated with the addition of 0 . 4 mM isopropyl β - D - 1 - thiogalactopyranoside ( IPTG ) ( Fisher Scientific ; BP1755 ) . Cells were then incubated for 16 – 18 hr at 18°C for optimal protein production . To purify His 6 - Ank1 from bacteria , frozen cell pellets expressing His 6 - Ank1 were lysed in 20 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 4 and 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM DTT , 1 mM PMSF , 2 mM benzamidine , and protease inhibitor cocktail . Lysates were sonicated three times for 30s , with a 30s pause between sonications ( Sonic Dismembrator Model F60 , Fisher Scientific ; power 15 watts ) . Lysates were cleared for 15 min at 12k rpm . Cleared lysate was then used in a batch purification protocol by addition of cOmplete His - Tag resin ( Roche ; 5893682001 ) for 1 hr at 4°C . Resin was then washed three times with buffer . Protein was eluted with 200 mM imidazole , incubated with thrombin for 2 h at RT and concentrated ( Amicon Ultra - 0 . 5 centrifugal filter unit ) . Myo1 ( 1 - 964 ) - FLAG 3 , Cam1 , Cam2 were expressed in baculovirus - infected Sf9 insect cells using the Bac - to - Bac system ( Invitrogen ) . Sf9 cells were coinfected with recombinant baculovirus and after 72 h at 27 °C , the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5 , 000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C . The cells were resuspended in ice - cold buffer containing 50 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 4 150 mM NaCl , 2 mM EGTA , 1 mM DTT , 1 mM PMSF , 2 mM benzamidine , and protease inhibitor cocktail and lysed by sonication on ice . Cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 12k rpm for 10 min at 4 °C . The clarified supernatant was batch - incubated with Fab - TRAP agarose ( Proteintech , ffa ) for 1 h at 4°C . The resin was then washed with buffer . 17 In vitro binding In vitro binding assays were performed in buffer containing 20 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 4 , 150 mM NaCl , 2 mM EGTA and 1 mM DTT . Recombinant Myo1 ( 1 - 964 ) - FLAG 3 - Cam1 - Cam2 conjugated to Fab - TRAP beads were incubated with recombinant Ank1 for 1 h at 4°C before washing samples in buffer . Samples were resolved by SDS - PAGE for Coomassie blue staining and imaged on an Odyssey CLx instrument . Liposome methods Liposome were made from Folch fraction lipids ( Sigma Aldrich ; B1502 ) . CHCl 3 lipid stocks were mixed and dried under N 2 gas followed by removal of chloroform under high vacuum . Liposomes were then rehydrated in 50 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 4 and 150 mM NaCl 2 mM EGTA for 30 mins , vigorously vortexed for 1 min and then subjected to ten freeze / thaw cycles and extruded through polycarbonate filters of 400 nm pore size ( Millipore Sigma ; WHA10417104 ) using a mini - extruder ( Avanti Polar Lipids ; 610017 ) . For co - pelleting assays Myo1 ( 1 - 964 ) - FLAG 3 , Cam1 , Cam2 with or without 1 - 2 uM Ank1 was added to 5 - 10 nM liposomes or buffer for control . The reaction was incubated for 30 min at 4°C and then centrifuged at 150 , 000 g in an Optima TL ultracentrifuge for 15 min at 25°C . Pellet and supernatant fractions were resuspended in equal volumes and analyzed by SDS - PAGE . Protein bands were visualized using Coomassie staining and imaged using an Odyssey CLx instrument . Large - scale purifications and LC - MS / MS analysis A 2 L culture of myo1 - GFP was grown in 4X YE media ( meaning 4x the concentration ) , generating a pellet of cells ( approximately 20 mL packed volume ) . Cells were lysed under native conditions in a glass bead beater with NP - 40 lysis buffer . The lysate was cleared at low speed ( 3000 rpm ) on a tabletop centrifuge . The supernatant was transferred to a clean tube and 30 μL of GFP - TRAP magnetic agarose beads ( Proteintech , cat # gtma ) pre - washed with NP - 40 buffer were added and nutated at 4°C for 1 - 1 . 5 h . The beads were then washed with NP - 40 buffer two times ( 5 mL ) and then once with 5 mL low - NP - 40 buffer ( 0 . 02 % NP - 40 ) prior to elution from beads with 100 μL 18 of 200 mM glycine twice . The eluate was TCA precipitated ( 25 % TCA on ice ) and proteins were identified using liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry ( LC - MS ) as detailed below . A control purification was also performed from untagged yeast and proteins identified by MS were subtracted from the list of potential interactors . MS analysis Protein pellets were resuspended , digested with trypsin and analyzed by 2D - LC - MS / MS as previously described ( Chen et al . , 2013 ) using a Thermo LTQ ( Thermo Scientific ) with the following modifications : Peptide identifications were filtered and assembled using Scaffold ( version 4 . 4 . 8 ; Proteome Software ) using the following filters : minimum of 99 . 0 % protein identification probability , minimum of 2 unique peptides , minimum of 95 % peptide identification probability . Protein hits were further filtered in Excel to define proteins localized to the division site ( TSC ≥ 5 ) according to Pombase . org ( Wood et al . , 2012 ) . Protein structure prediction and sequence alignment Protein structure predictions were generated with the ColabFold interface to the AlphaFold2 pipeline on the Colab platform ( AlphaFold2 . ipynb ) ( Jumper et al . , 2021 ; Mirdita et al . , 2022 ; Varadi et al . , 2022 ) .

E ) Live - cell TIRFM of Myo1e - mNG cells expressing mCherry or OSTF1 - mCherry . Scale bar , 10 μm . F ) In wildtype cells ( left ) myosin - 1 exists in a cytoplasmic pool bound by Ank1 / OSTF1 , and a membrane bound pool at sites of endocytosis that lack Ank1 / OSTF1 . When yeast cells lack ank1 + ( middle ) , myosin - 1 constitutively binds along the entire PM and these cells have defects in endocytic internalization . Overproduction 22 of Ank1 or OSTF1 ( right ) causes all the myosin - 1 to be cytoplasmic and not localize to sites of endocytosis . In yeast cells this leads to severe endocytic internalization defects . Created with BioRender . com . Supplemental Figure 1 – Ank1 associates with myosin - 1 .
