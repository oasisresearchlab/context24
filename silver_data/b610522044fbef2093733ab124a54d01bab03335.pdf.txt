Rapid - Response Splicing Reporter Screens Identify Differential Regulators of Constitutive and Alternative Splicing (cid:1) †‡ Ihab Younis , Michael Berg , Daisuke Kaida , Kimberly Dittmar , Congli Wang , and Gideon Dreyfuss * Howard Hughes Medical Institute , Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics , University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine , Philadelphia , Pennsylvania 19104 - 6148 Received 25 September 2009 / Returned for modiﬁcation 6 November 2009 / Accepted 19 January 2010 Bioactive compounds have been invaluable for dissecting the mechanisms , regulation , and functions of cellular processes . However , very few such reagents have been described for pre - mRNA splicing . To facilitate their systematic discovery , we developed a high - throughput cell - based assay that measures pre - mRNA splicing by utilizing a quantitative reporter system with advantageous features . The reporter , consisting of a destabi - lized , intron - containing luciferase expressed from a short - lived mRNA , allows rapid screens ( < 4 h ) , thereby obviating the potential toxicity of splicing inhibitors . We describe three inhibitors ( out of > 23 , 000 screened ) , all pharmacologically active : clotrimazole , ﬂunarizine , and chlorhexidine . Interestingly , none was a general splicing inhibitor . Rather , each caused distinct splicing changes of numerous genes . We further discovered the target of action of chlorhexidine and show that it is a selective inhibitor of speciﬁc Cdc2 - like kinases ( Clks ) that phosphorylate serine - arginine - rich ( SR ) protein splicing factors . Our ﬁndings reveal unexpected activities of clinically used drugs in splicing and uncover differential regulation of constitutively spliced introns . Extensive posttranscriptional processing of eukaryotic pre - mRNA is required for the biogenesis of mRNAs , including 7 - methylguanosine cap addition at the 5 (cid:1) end , cleavage and polyadenylation at the 3 (cid:1) end , and splicing of introns . The vast majority of genes in complex eukaryotes contain multiple in - trons that need to be spliced out by the spliceosome with high ﬁdelity in order to generate the open reading frame ( ORF ) and the 5 (cid:1) and 3 (cid:1) untranslated regions ( UTR ) carried by the exons . Splicing depends on the recognition of short consensus sequences at the intron - exon boundaries and within introns by a set of small nuclear ribonucleoprotein ( snRNP ) complexes ( consisting of snRNPs U1 , U2 , U4 , U5 , U6 , U11 , U12 , U4atac , and U6atac ) and a large number of proteins , including spli - ceosomal proteins and positively as well as negatively acting splicing modulators ( 12 , 59 ) . Serine - arginine - rich ( SR ) - do - main - containing proteins ( 36 ) generally serve to promote con - stitutive splicing . They also modulate alternative splicing by binding to intronic or exonic splicing enhancer ( ISE or ESE , respectively ) sequences ( 5 , 20 ) . Other pre - mRNA binding pro - teins , such as hnRNPs , that lack SR domains regulate splicing by binding to intronic or exonic splicing suppressor ( ISS or ESS , respectively ) sites and also act as general splicing modu - lators ( 14 , 62 ) . Alternative splicing allows for a single gene to express dif - ferent isoforms of mRNA , thus playing a major role in con - tributing to the cellular complexity in higher eukaryotes with - out the need to expand the genome ( 6 ) . Global surveying of the human transcriptome estimates that up to 95 % of mul - tiexon genes undergo alternative splicing ( 46 , 60 ) . Importantly , these events are highly regulated by numerous splicing factors in a tissue type - , developmental stage - , and signal - dependent manner . Aberrations in splicing due to mutations in the pre - mRNA are responsible for up to 15 % of inherited diseases ( 32 ) . In addition , defects in the splicing machinery itself due to the loss / gain of function of splicing factors or their relative stoichiometry are causes of a wide range of human ailments , from cancer to neurodegenerative diseases ( 12 , 18 , 35 , 57 ) . It has been established that splicing is subject to regulation by upstream signaling pathways . However , the details of the un - derlying mechanisms or the speciﬁc proteins involved in such regulation remain largely unclear . The signiﬁcant link between splicing defects and human diseases underscores the para - mount importance of understanding the mechanisms of splic - ing , including the signaling pathways that regulate general splicing as well as splicing of speciﬁc subsets of transcripts . Small molecules have been essential in uncovering the mechanisms , regulations , and functions of many cellular pro - cesses , including DNA replication , transcription , and transla - tion . While several recent reports have described screens for effectors of splicing , only a small number of constitutive or alternative splicing inhibitors have been identiﬁed ( 24 , 31 , 34 , 42 , 47 , 53 – 55 ) . Here , we describe a cell - based reporter system with advantageous properties that can be used for systematic discovery of modulators of splicing and splicing - dependent processes . Screening a collection of (cid:2) 23 , 000 compounds iden - tiﬁed small molecules that modulate both constitutive and al - ternative splicing . We describe here three of the most active compounds , all of which are in wide clinical use . While none was a general splicing inhibitor , we show that , unexpectedly , clotrimazole and ﬂunarizine each inhibited a different set of constitutively spliced introns .

MATERIALS AND METHODS Reporter construction and generation of stable cell lines . An intron - contain - ing luciferase reporter was generated by inserting a 132 - nucleotide chimeric (cid:3) - globin / immunoglobulin intron ( Promega ) at nucleotide position 1344 of the ﬁreﬂy luciferase gene . The luciferase protein is destabilized using both a PEST protein degradation sequence and a CL1 sequence . In order to destabilize the mRNA , ﬁve tandem AUUUA repeats were introduced into the 3 (cid:1) UTR of the reporter luciferase gene . Both intron - containing and intronless luciferases were transcribed from a cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) promoter . To generate stable cell lines , transfected HeLa cells were selected for integration using hygromycin for 2 to 3 weeks . The luciferase assay was done according to the manufacturer’s recommendation ( Promega ) . Chemical compounds and high - throughput screen ( HTS ) . A collection of (cid:2) 23 , 000 small molecules , including known bioactive compounds and FDA - ap - proved drugs , was assembled from several commercial sources ( Microsource Diversity , Sigma - Aldrich , BioMol , Tocris , Lopac , Prestwick , Maybridge , and Chembridge ) and maintained at a 2 mM stock concentration in dimethyl sulfox - ide ( DMSO ) . For conﬁrmation studies , clotrimazole , ﬂunarizine , and chlorhexi - dine were purchased from Sigma - Aldrich . For HTS , 2 , 000 cells in 4 (cid:4) l medium per well were seeded on white 1 , 536 - well plates ( Corning ) by using an automated dispenser ( Deerac Fluidics ) and allowed to grow overnight . For each plate , the ﬁrst two and last two columns were controls treated with DMSO and assigned an activity of 100 % . Compounds were administered to the central wells in duplicates . Brieﬂy , 70 nl of compounds diluted in growth medium ( ﬁnal concentration of 20 (cid:4) M ) was added to wells by using a Pintool ( V & P Scientiﬁc ) attached to a Biomek FX workstation ( Beckman Coulter ) , and the plates were incubated for an additional 4 h . Subsequently , 4 (cid:4) l of One - Glo reagent ( Promega ) was added , and luminescence signals were mea - sured using an EnVision microplate reader ( Perkin Elmer ) with standard lumi - nescence settings . RNA extraction and reverse transcription - PCR ( RT - PCR ) . To analyze the effect of the splicing inhibitors on reporter RNA and endogenous RNA splicing , HeLa cells were seeded in 12 - well plates for 24 h , followed by treatment with the various compounds for the indicated times . Total RNA was extracted using an RNeasy kit ( Qiagen ) in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions , fol - lowed by cDNA synthesis from 1 (cid:4) g total RNA . Nonquantitative PCR was performed using 5 (cid:4) l of diluted cDNA and Pfx DNA polymerase ( Invitrogen ) . Quantitative real - time PCR using 5 (cid:4) l of the same cDNA and relative quanti - ﬁcation analysis were performed with an Applied Biosystems 7500 fast system by using SYBR green dye chemistry in accordance with the manufacturer’s recom - mendations . All primers are listed in Table S2 in the supplemental material . In vitro splicing . The pre - mRNA minigenes CDC14 - 15 ( chicken delta crystal - line ) , HIV Tat2 - 3 , H (cid:3)(cid:5) 6 ( Globin1 - 2 ) , and (cid:4) C3 - C4 and their splicing conditions were previously described ( 27 , 37 , 38 ) . Brieﬂy , the pre - mRNAs were labeled with [ (cid:6) - 32 P ] UTP by in vitro transcription with SP6 polymerase , followed by gel puri - ﬁcation . Splicing reactions were performed using HEK 293T total ( CDC14 - 15 ) or HeLa nuclear ( Tat2 - 3 , (cid:4) C3 - C4 , and H (cid:3)(cid:5) 6 ) extract in the presence of DMSO or the speciﬁed compounds and incubated for 90 to 120 min at 30°C . Splicing products were puriﬁed by Trizol for CDC14 - 15 or by proteinase K digestion , followed by phenol - chloroform extraction for HIV Tat2 - 3 , (cid:4) C3 - C4 , and H (cid:3)(cid:5) 6 , and resolved on denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( PAGE ) gel . Quantitative Western blotting . Protein samples were resolved by SDS - PAGE and transferred to a 0 . 2 - (cid:4) m nitrocellulose membrane , which was blocked in Li - COR blocking buffer . Primary antibodies were diluted in Li - COR blocking buffer plus 0 . 2 % Tween 20 . The membranes were then washed 4 times , 15 min each , with phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) containing 0 . 1 % Tween 20 . Second - ary antibodies ( IRDye 800 ; Rockland ) were used at a 1 : 5 , 000 dilution . The membranes were washed 4 times as described above . Detection of signal and quantiﬁcation were done using an Odyssey infrared imaging system . Anti - phos - pho - SR protein ( 1H4 ) , anti - SF2 / ASF , anti - SRm160 , and anti - SRp20 antibodies were purchased from Abcam . Anti - eIF4A3 ( 3F1 ) and anti - Magoh ( 18G12 ) were previously described ( 10 , 28 ) . In vitro kinase proﬁling . Activated recombinant kinases , including Cdc2 - like kinases 1 to 4 ( Clk1 - 4 ) , SR protein kinases 1 and 2 ( SRPK1 - 2 ) , Jun N - terminal protein kinase ( JNK ) , and extracellular signal - related kinase ( ERK ) , were incu - bated with a synthetic SR - rich substrate peptide in the presence of 50 (cid:4) M ATP and [ (cid:6) - 32 P ] ATP cocktail in kinase assay buffer ( 5 mM MOPS , pH 7 . 2 , 2 . 5 mM (cid:3) - glycerol - phosphate , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 0 . 4 mM EDTA , 0 . 05 mM dithiothreitol [ DTT ] ) for 20 min . Either DMSO or chlorhexidine was added at various concentrations . The assay was terminated by spotting 10 (cid:4) l of the reac - tion mixture onto a phosphocellulose P81 plate , followed by washing 3 times for 15 min each in 1 % phosphoric acid solution . The radioactivity on the P81 plate was counted with scintillation ﬂuid in a TriLux scintillation counter . Exon microarray target preparation , array hybridization , and data analysis . Biotinylated sense - strand DNA targets were prepared using the Affymetrix Ge - neChip whole - transcript ( WT ) sense target labeling assay in accordance with the manufacturer’s directions . One microgram of total RNA from cells treated with chlorhexidine ( n (cid:7) 3 ) , clotrimazole ( n (cid:7) 3 ) , ﬂunarizine ( n (cid:7) 3 ) , and DMSO ( n (cid:7) 6 ) was used as an input for rRNA reduction with an Invitrogen RiboMinus transcriptome isolation kit in accordance with the manufacturer’s directions . The total resulting volume was used for the ﬁrst round of ampliﬁcation . Ten micro - grams of the resulting cRNA was used to proceed to the second round of ampliﬁcation . A hybridization cocktail including 5 . 5 (cid:4) g of fragmented , end - labeled single - stranded DNA ( ssDNA ) was applied to GeneChip Human Exon 1 . 0 ST arrays . Hybridization was performed using F450 - 001 ﬂuidics wash and stain script on an Affymetrix GeneChip Fluidics Station 450 . Arrays were scanned using an Affymetrix GCS 3000 7G and GeneChip operating software ( GCOS ) to produce CEL intensity ﬁles . Probe set intensities were calculated from the CEL ﬁles of the 15 samples by using the robust multiarray average ( RMA ) algorithm with default settings at both the gene level and the probe set level in Partek Genomic Suite 6 . 4 , using the core probe sets as deﬁned by Affymetrix . Probe sets with a maximum RMA intensity of 3 across all samples were excluded to eliminate probe sets with low expression levels . Alternative splicing multiway analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) was applied using Partek defaults with terms ( probe set identiﬁcation number and group ) not only reﬂecting experimental conditions but also allowing detec - tion of alternative splicing events that differ between the treated samples and their appropriate controls . Step - up false discovery rates ( FDR ) were calculated , and genes with FDR values of (cid:8) 0 . 01 for differential expression or alternative splicing were considered . One - way ANOVA was also applied at the exon level to determine differential expression of exons . These data were used to generate heat maps by using SpotFire DecisionSite . Microarray data accession number . The CEL ﬁles were deposited in the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus repository under accession number GSE19891 . RESULTS Rapid - response splicing reporter system for discovery of modulators of splicing . In order to identify small molecules that regulate the splicing machinery or splicing - dependent pro - cesses , we generated a reporter in which the ORF of ﬁreﬂy ( Photinus pyralis ) luciferase is interrupted by a chimeric (cid:3) - glo - bin / immunoglobulin intron ( Luc - I ) that has been optimized to splice with high efﬁciency ( 51 ) ( Fig . 1A ) . In cases where this intron is not spliced out , several stop codons appear in frame , resulting in a truncated luciferase protein that has no enzy - matic activity . To characterize the splicing reporters , we trans - fected cells with either intronless ( Luc ) or intron - containing luciferase reporters . Consistent with previous reports ( 13 , 43 , 63 ) , splicing conferred an advantage to gene expression , as equal amounts of transfected DNA generated 2 - to 3 - fold more luciferase signal from Luc - I than from Luc ( Fig . 1B ) . Since splicing is an essential process in mammalian cells , we reasoned that splicing inhibitors would be toxic to cells . To circumvent this , we designed a reporter system that enables the readout of signals in a short screening time ( (cid:8) 4 h ) so that the time during which cells are exposed to small molecules is minimal , and no global toxic effects are observed , but is long enough for the reporter to sense changes in splicing . To achieve this , the splicing reporter needs to be highly sensitive and fast responding . Thus , we designed the reporters with elements to shorten the half - life of the luciferase protein as well as the luciferase mRNA . We utilized destabilizing se - V OL . 30 , 2010 SPLICING SCREENS SHOW DIFFERENTIAL SPLICING REGULATION 1719 a t UN I VE R S I T Y O F PE NN SY L VA N I A L I B R A R Y on M a y 20 , 2010 m c b . a s m . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m quences ( DS ) that were added to the C terminus of the protein ( protein DS CL1 and PEST ) as well as ﬁve consecutive AUUUA elements to the 3 (cid:1) UTR ( RNA DS ARE ) for rapid mRNA turnover ( Fig . 1A ) . We conﬁrmed that these elements confer a fast response by treatment of Luc - or Luc - I - trans - fected cells with either cycloheximide or actinomycin D . As shown in Fig . 1C , 4 h of treatment with cycloheximide , which blocks protein synthesis , leads to the loss of 90 % of the lucif - erase signal , indicating that the reporter protein did not accu - mulate in cells and that this protein is highly sensitive to in - hibitors of gene expression . Blocking transcription with actinomycin D for the same time period caused 60 % reduction in the signal , suggesting that the mRNA has a half - life of around 4 h . Importantly , both reporters showed similar re - sponses to regulation of gene expression , eliminating the need to adjust for potentially differential stability conferred by splic - ing of the Luc - I reporter . We concluded that the reporter should be able to detect changes in splicing , especially inhibi - tion , within 4 h of drug treatment of cells and thus performed all further analyses of the luciferase reporter within that time frame . High - throughput screening identiﬁes splicing inhibitors . We next generated HeLa cell lines harboring the Luc or Luc - I luciferase reporter . Analysis of RNA processed from these cells revealed that the majority of detectable Luc - I mRNA from the stable lines is spliced ( data not shown ) . To identify modulators of splicing , we performed an ultra - high - throughput screen ( 1 , 536 - well format ) utilizing these cell lines . The strategy of the screen , including the validation and characterization assays , is summa - rized in a workﬂow diagram in Fig . 2A . Shown in Fig . 2B are data from a representative plate treated with DMSO , actinomycin D , or cycloheximide . Analysis of this plate shows a high signal - to - noise ratio ( more than 100 - fold ) , a coefﬁcient of variance ( CV ) of 11 to 15 % , and a Z (cid:1) factor of at least 0 . 6 , indicating that this cell - based assay is highly robust and reliable . The short assay time made it unnecessary to normalize the signal - to - cell number . A collection of (cid:2) 23 , 000 chemically and functionally diverse com - pounds assembled from commercial sources was ﬁrst screened on the Luc - I cell line . Approximately 250 compounds showed an effect of more than 3 times the standard deviation ( SD ) in com - parison to the level for the DMSO control wells on the same plate . However , compounds that affect ﬁreﬂy luciferase enzymatic activity or protein stability could be mistakenly identiﬁed as gene expression modulators if counterscreened on Renilla luciferase or other reporters ( 2 ) . We therefore counterscreened the same com - pounds in cells expressing an intronless ﬁreﬂy luciferase ( Luc ) . This also allows us to ﬁlter away compounds that modulate gen - eral processes other than splicing , such as transcription or trans - lation . Indeed , a large fraction of compounds modulated Luc in the same manner as Luc - I and were therefore eliminated . The FIG . 1 . Characterization of the splicing reporter .

Three of these , clotrimazole { 1 - [ ( 2 - chlorophenyl ) - di ( phenyl ) - methyl ] imidazole } , ﬂunarizine { 1 - [ bis ( 4 - ﬂuorophenyl ) methyl ] - 4 - [ ( E ) - 3 - phenylprop - 2 - enyl ] piperazine } , and chlorhexidine { ( 1E ) - 2 - [ 6 - [ [ amino - [ [ amino - ( 4 - chloroanilino ) methylidene ] - amino ] methylidene ] amino ] hexyl ] - 1 - [ amino - ( 4 - chloro - anilino ) methylidene ] guanidine } , which are compounds in wide clinical use and have not previously been shown to affect splicing , are described here in detail . Measurements of a wide range of concentrations showed that clotrimazole and ﬂunarizine had a dose - dependent inhibition of Luc - I , with 50 % inhibitory concen - trations ( IC 50 s ) between 40 and 50 (cid:4) M , while chlorhexidine had a smaller effect on Luc - I at concentrations up to 20 (cid:4) M ( Fig . 3 ; see also Fig . S1 in the supplemental material ) . Higher concentra - tions of chlorhexidine were toxic to these cells even at the 4 - hour treatment time point . To verify that the change in Luc - I signal is due to splicing modulation , we used real - time PCR to measure the levels of spliced luciferase mRNA in cells treated with the three compounds at their IC 50 s . Both clotrimazole and ﬂunarizine strongly decreased spliced Luc - I mRNA levels , while chlorhexi - dine had a modest but reproducible effect ( Fig . 3 ) . The spliced mRNA measurements were normalized to those of intronless Luc in order to eliminate effects on transcription or mRNA stability . Effect of inhibitors on splicing of endogenous genes in vivo . To determine the effect of the compounds on splicing of en - dogenous genes , we analyzed constitutive and alternative splic - ing patterns of several genes by RT - PCR . Interestingly , none of the compounds inhibited every splicing event ; rather , each compound showed a unique pattern of inhibition and induced distinct alternative splicing changes ( Fig . 4A and data not shown ) . For example , both clotrimazole and ﬂunarizine inhib - ited splicing of coilin intron 2 , whereas chlorhexidine , which had no effect on this intron , modulated the splicing of several alternatively spliced exons , including SR protein - regulated RON exon 11 and caspase 9 ( Fig . 4A ) . To obtain a quantitative measure of the differential effects of these compounds , we performed detailed real - time PCR for spliced and unspliced mRNAs of several major ( U2 - dependent ) and minor ( U12 - dependent ) introns . As shown in Fig . 4B , splicing of both major FIG . 2 . High - throughput screen for splicing modulators . ( A ) Workﬂow for HTS .

We further extended this analysis to more than 30 constitutively spliced introns that had a wide range of sizes and have not previously been shown to be regulated ( Fig . 4C ) . These data indicated that clotrimazole and ﬂunarizine are not general splicing in - hibitors . Instead , each inhibited a subset of these introns , whereas chlorhexidine inhibited a smaller and distinct set of constitutively spliced introns ( Fig . 4C ) , suggesting that these compounds regulate splicing by different mechanisms . Bioin - formatic analysis of the affected introns did not show distinc - tive features such as splice site strength or common motifs . Nevertheless , these data uncover an unexpected differential regulation of constitutively spliced introns in cells . Chlorhexidine modulates SR protein - regulated splicing by inhibiting the Clk family of SR protein kinases . We next tested the effect of the compounds on constitutive and SR protein - regulated splicing in vitro . CDC14 - 15 pre - mRNA is constitutively spliced in HeLa nuclear extract , and none of the compounds inhibited its splicing in vitro ( Fig . 5A ) . However , the splicing of the same intron in the context of the luciferase reporter was modulated by the three compounds when tested with intact cells ( data not shown ) . This suggests that the com - pounds do not target the basal splicing machinery but rather FIG . 3 . Splicing inhibitors identiﬁed from HTS inhibit luciferase protein and mRNA expression . Luc - I cells were treated with various concentrations of clotrimazole , ﬂunarizine , and chlorhexidine for 4 h . Luciferase activity , measured in light units , reﬂects the amount of luciferase protein produced ( blue bars ) . To quantify the amount of spliced luciferase mRNA , real - time qPCR was performed at the IC 50 of each compound ( red bars ) . The spliced mRNA measurements were normalized to those of intronless Luc in order to eliminate effects on transcription or mRNA stability . Data are presented as percentages of the level for DMSO - treated cells , and error bars denote the standard deviations for three independent experiments . 1722 YOUNIS ET AL . M OL . C ELL .

Interestingly , chlorhexidine mod - ulated the in vitro splicing of the three SR protein - regulated pre - mRNAs that were tested ( Tat , (cid:4) C3 - C4 , and H (cid:3)(cid:5) 6 ) , sug - gesting that it can modulate SR protein - regulated splicing both in vitro and in vivo ( Fig . 5B and 4A ) . We therefore investigated the effect of chlorhexidine on SR protein phosphorylation , which is a major determinant of splic - ing regulation . Western blotting using antibodies speciﬁc for phosphorylated SR proteins revealed that chlorhexidine de - creased the phosphorylation of several SR proteins , including SRp75 , SRp55 , SRp40 , and SRp30 , at concentrations as low as 10 (cid:4) M ( Fig . 6A ) . These effects were comparable to those observed for TG003 , a previously described regulator of SR protein phosphorylation ( 42 ) . Other SR and SR - like proteins , such as SF2 / ASF , SRp20 , and SRm160 , were not signiﬁcantly affected at these concentrations . For reference , the levels of other proteins involved in mRNA biogenesis were not affected ( Fig . 6A ) . In light of the pronounced effect of chlorhexidine on SR protein - regulated splicing and SR protein phosphorylation , we tested its effect on several kinases known to target SR proteins . With the use of recombinant kinases and an SR - rich peptide derived from SF2 / ASF as a substrate , chlorhexidine showed speciﬁc inhibition of the Cdc2 - like kinase ( Clk ) family of SR protein kinases . No inhibition by chlorhexidine of other known SR protein kinases ( SRPK1 and SRPK2 ) as well as other FIG . 4 .

( B ) Real - time qPCR analysis of the samples shown in panel A . For each endogenous gene , a set of primers was designed to distinguish between exon - exon junction ( spliced ) and exon - intron junction ( unspliced ) . Coilin intron 2 and ILF2 introns 4 and 5 are major ( U2 dependent ) , whereas CCDC56 intron 1 and IK intron 14 are minor ( U12 dependent ) . Three independent replicates were used for each treatment , and data are presented relative to the level for DMSO , which was set to 1 .

Each bar represents the average of results from three measurements , and data are presented relative to the level for DMSO , which was set to 1 . All qPCR measurements were normalized to the level for (cid:3) - actin .

Moreover , chlorhexidine showed selectivity for different members of the Clk family . Clk4 and Clk3 were most sensitive to chlorhexidine treatment , with IC 50 s of 10 and 15 (cid:4) M , respectively , whereas Clk2 and Clk1 were less affected , with IC 50 s of 25 and (cid:2) 50 (cid:4) M , respectively . Differential effects of the compounds on alternative splicing . Given the effect of chlorhexidine on several alternatively spliced exons , we wished to assess its effect , as well as those of clotrimazole and ﬂunarizine , on splicing at a genome - wide level . RNAs processed from cells treated with clotrimazole ( 40 (cid:4) M ) , ﬂunarizine ( 40 (cid:4) M ) , and chlorhexidine ( 10 (cid:4) M ) were analyzed by exon arrays . For chlorhexidine , the data showed a large number of alternative splicing changes ( 1 , 444 transcripts at FDR values of (cid:8) 0 . 01 ) , compared to only 191 genes affected at the whole - transcript level , namely , at transcriptional or mRNA stability levels , indicating high selectivity of chlorhexi - dine for alternative splicing regulation ( see Table S1 in the supplemental material ) . Clotrimazole and ﬂunarizine were found to cause fewer alternative splicing changes when the same statistical cutoff was used ( 874 and 326 genes , respec - tively ) . Conﬁrmation of a select number of the affected tran - scripts is presented in Fig . S2 in the supplemental material , and the overlap among these transcripts and the breakdown of the splicing alterations are shown in Fig . S3 in the supplemental material . We note that transcripts that were affected by at least two of the compounds frequently showed different proﬁles at the exon level ( Fig . 7 ) . For example , some exons were in - creased or decreased in all three treatments ( DOM3Z , MYLIP , and TTYH3 ) . Others were affected by two of the three compounds ( ARNT2 , SCN4A , DNTT , and NAV3 ) , whereas some showed opposing effects in different treatments ( APBB1IP , JAK3 , MTMR11 , C11orf60 , PLAU , and SRPK2 ) . In addition , some transcripts with intronic probes showed unique effects for each of the three compounds ( DFFA , OGT , MTMR11 , MAPKAPK2 , TUBGCP3 , and SFRS10 ) . Thus , clo - trimazole , ﬂunarizine , and chlorhexidine have differential ef - fects on constitutively spliced introns and on alternative splic - ing in cells . DISCUSSION The splicing reporter system that we describe here has sev - eral advantageous properties that make it a powerful tool for the discovery of inhibitors and modulators of splicing and splicing - dependent processes in cells . Our assay system was designed to overcome two major potential problems . First , given the essential role of splicing in gene expression , pro - longed exposure to splicing inhibitors would be toxic to cells and preclude their discovery . We therefore reasoned that the reporter needed to be highly sensitive and robust and provide real - time readout of changes in splicing before general toxic effects interfere . We achieved this by incorporating destabiliz - ing elements in both the luciferase protein and the mRNA encoding it , generating a rapid - response reporter with a half - life of less than 4 h . Second , many compounds could affect the enzymatic activity or stability of the reporter or steps in its expression other than splicing , such as transcription and trans - lation . To address this , we constructed a ﬁreﬂy luciferase re - porter gene that was the same except for its lack of an intron and eliminated compounds that showed an effect on both Luc and Luc - I . The assay is suitable for large - scale screens for chemical and genetic modiﬁers of splicing in 384 - and 1 , 536 - well formats . This strategy opens up the possibility of discov - ering splicing inhibitors that would likely not be identiﬁed by other recently described cell - based assays ( 34 , 44 , 54 ) . Further - more , the short time frame of the assay helps minimize sec - ondary effects of compounds and increases the likelihood of capturing direct effects on splicing . Screening with this assay , using a strong intron commonly FIG . 5 . In vitro effects of splicing modulators .

Importantly , each showed differential effects on constitu - tive and alternative splicing . Both clotrimazole and ﬂunarizine inhibited splicing of many introns but had distinct proﬁles . Of the introns tested , each compound inhibited some that the other did not ; some were inhibited by both , and some showed different degrees of inhibition for the two compounds . This suggests that although both clotrimazole and ﬂunarizine inhibit the splicing of the reporter , they do so by different modes of action . We note that neither compound inhibited splicing in vitro of several test introns . Thus , unlike spliceostatin A and pladienolide ( 24 , 31 ) , clotrimazole and ﬂunarizine do not in - hibit components of the basal splicing machinery such as U2 snRNP , which is surprising because the (cid:3) - globin / immunoglob - ulin intron used in the screen is considered to be independent of splicing factors due to its strong ( constitutive ) splice sites ( 51 ) . These ﬁndings also underscore the capacity of cell - based screens to reveal regulatory mechanisms that are not recapit - ulated in an in vitro system . Our observations suggest that entirely constitutive splicing may not exist in cells and that all introns are regulated . The compounds that we identiﬁed should make it possible to discover the pathways and factors involved in this unexpected aspect of regulation of constitu - tively spliced introns . Clotrimazole is widely used without prescription for treat - ment of fungal infections . In mammalian cells , it inhibits cyto - chrome P450 , interferes with cellular calcium homeostasis ( 1 , 4 , 58 ) , and inhibits proliferation of cancer and vascular endo - thelial cells ( 4 , 29 , 56 ) . Flunarizine is a calcium channel blocker and vasodilator that is used to treat neurological disorders , including vertigo , migraine , and epilepsy ( 22 , 49 ) . It has a protective effect on neurons from serum and nerve growth FIG . 6 . Chlorhexidine inhibits SR protein phosphorylation . ( A ) Total protein extracts from cells treated with 0 , 10 , and 20 (cid:4) M chlorhexidine or TG003 for 6 h were separated by SDS - PAGE , and phosphorylated SR proteins were detected by Western blotting using the SR protein phospho - speciﬁc monoclonal antibody ( 1H4 ) . Quantiﬁcation of the phosphorylated SR proteins is depicted in the histogram . Values are presented relative to the level for DMSO , which was set to 1 ( dashed line ) .

Clotrim - azole and ﬂunarizine have not previously been shown to have an effect on splicing . The mechanism by which these com - pounds inhibit splicing is not presently known , and it is thus not clear whether this is related to their clinical efﬁcacy . It is noted , however , that both affect calcium physiology . Several antican - cer drugs have been recently shown to affect alternative splic - ing of a group of apoptosis - related test genes ( 52 ) . However , the drug treatments were for 24 h , and thus , the effects on splicing could be an adaptive response rather than a direct effect . Some of these were included in the library of com - pounds that we screened but did not show speciﬁc activity in our assay . Our results demonstrate that chlorhexidine had a weaker effect on constitutive splicing than clotrimazole and ﬂunariz - ine . However , it was highly effective in modulating alternative splicing . Chlorhexidine is a widely used , prescription - free dis - infectant and topical anti - infective agent , most commonly used in mouthwash . In addition to its broad - spectrum antibacterial activity , chlorhexidine is active against yeast and some lipid - enveloped viruses , including HIV ( 40 ) . It has also been re - ported to induce an inﬂammatory reaction ( 45 , 65 ) and tissue necrosis ( 16 ) . Several mechanisms have been suggested for this induced toxicity , including inhibition of mitochondrial activity , protein and DNA synthesis , endoplasmic reticulum stress , an increase in intracellular calcium , and induction of oxidative stress ( 19 , 23 ) . However , chlorhexidine has not previously been known to have an effect on splicing . Because our data demonstrated that chlorhexidine affected alternative splicing of many exons , including those of RON , caspase 9 , and HIV Tat2 - 3 , which are known to be regulated by SR proteins , we studied its effect on this major class of splicing factors . SR proteins play critical roles in both constitutive and alternative splicing ( 5 , 7 , 20 , 36 ) . Phosphorylation of the RS domain of SR proteins regulates their activity in alternative splicing by modulating their protein - protein interactions , RNA binding , cellular localization , and stability ( 8 , 9 , 15 , 41 , 64 ) . We found marked reductions in the phosphorylation states of SRp75 , SRp55 , and SRp30 after chlorhexidine treatment . Other SR proteins , such as SRp20 , were not affected . It has been shown that the relative stoichiometry of SR proteins on a given pre - mRNA is complex and depends on their phosphor - FIG . 7 . Differential effects of splicing modulators on alternative splicing . Heat maps of representative transcripts from the exon array are shown , with the gene structure depicted below the heat map . 1726 YOUNIS ET AL . M OL . C ELL .

Since chlorhexidine did not affect the phosphorylation of all SR proteins to the same level , it is impossible to predict the outcome of chlorhexidine treatment on a given splicing event . For example , while inhibition of (cid:4) C3 - C4 splicing could be due to the inability of a dephosphor - ylated SR protein ( s ) , such as ASF / SF2 , to bind and enhance splicing , the increased splicing efﬁciency of Tat2 - 3 could be explained in light of previous data showing that SC35 can bind to an exonic splicing silencer and repress splicing of Tat2 - 3 ( 38 ) . Thus , the release of SC35 from this pre - mRNA or the disruption of the balance between SC35 and ASF / SF2 could lead to enhanced splicing of Tat2 - 3 pre - mRNA . Several ki - nases that phosphorylate SR proteins and regulate their activ - ity have been described , particularly SRPKs ( 21 , 33 ) and Clks ( 3 , 11 ) . Other potential SR protein kinases have also been reported but remain less characterized , including pre - mRNA processing mutant 4 ( PRP4 ) ( 30 ) and topoisomerase I ( 48 ) . Our studies show that chlorhexidine is a selective inhibitor of Clk4 and Clk3 and to a lesser extent Clk2 . Clk1 , on the other hand , is only weakly inhibited by chlorhexidine . This activity proﬁle is different from that of a previously described Clk inhibitor , TG003 , which mainly targets Clk1 and Clk4 ( 42 ) . While all Clks can phosphorylate any SR protein in vitro , it was not previously known whether the individual Clks have activi - ties toward different SR proteins in cells . Our ﬁndings suggest that by inhibiting Clk4 and Clk3 , chlorhexidine decreases or alters the phosphorylation signature of a subset of SR proteins , resulting in a change in the splicing pattern of a distinct group of exons . Further characterization of these splicing events should provide a better understanding of the functional rela - tionship between phosphorylation of speciﬁc SR proteins by different Clks and their role in regulating alternative splicing . Chlorhexidine is therefore a valuable tool with which to dissect these mechanisms . Exon array analysis of clotrimazole - , ﬂunarizine - , or chlo - rhexidine - treated cells showed that each compound affects a distinct set of splicing events . Closer analysis of the transcripts that were affected by at least two compounds showed that a large fraction of these transcripts were affected on different exons or in opposite directions , indicating that each compound regulates splicing by a unique mechanism . The effect of the clinically used drugs clotrimazole , ﬂunarizine , and chlorhexi - dine on splicing is unexpected and off target at concentration ranges in which they show pharmacologic activity . This effect may provide a molecular basis for their toxicity as well as their activity and should help design more - speciﬁc next - generation drugs . The screening method that we describe will provide a wealth of additional reagents for studying the mechanism and regulation of splicing . With slight modiﬁcations , the same re - porter can be used to screen for effectors of speciﬁc introns and of other splicing - dependent processes .
