Interaction of Actin Monomers with Acanthamoeba Actophorin ( ADF / Cofilin ) and Profilin * ( Received for publication , May 1 , 1998 , and in revised form , July 7 , 1998 ) Laurent Blanchoin and Thomas D . Pollard‡ From the Structural Biology Laboratory , The Salk Institute for Biological Studies , La Jolla , California 92037 Acanthamoeba actophorin is a member of ADF / cofilin family that binds both actin monomers and filaments . We used fluorescence anisotropy to study the interac - tion of actin monomers with recombinant actophorin labeled with rhodamine on a cysteine substituted for Serine - 88 . Labeled actophorin retains its affinity for ac - tin and ability to reduce the low shear viscosity of actin filaments . At physiological ionic strength , actophorin binds Mg - ADP - actin monomers ( K d 5 0 . 1 m M ) 40 times stronger than Mg - ATP - actin monomers . When bound to actin monomers , actophorin has no effect on elongation at either end of actin filaments by Mg - ATP - actin and slightly increases the rate of elongation at both ends by Mg - ADP - actin . Thus actophorin does not sequester actin monomers . Sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifuga - tion shows that actophorin and profilin compete for binding actin monomers . Actophorin and profilin have opposite effects on the rate of exchange of nucleotide bound to actin monomers . Despite the high affinity of actophorin for ADP - actin , physiological concentrations of profilin overcome the inhibition of ADP exchange by actophorin . Profilin rapidly recycles ADP - actin back to the profilin - ATP - actin pool ready for elongation of actin filaments . Acanthamoeba actophorin ( 1 , 2 ) belongs to a family of low molecular weight actin - binding proteins including vertebrate cofilin , destrin , and ADF ( 3 – 9 ) , echinoderm depactin ( 10 , 11 ) , and yeast cofilin ( 12 , 13 ) . Cofilin is dephosphorylated in re - sponse to various agonists ( Refs . 14 – 16 ; and reviewed by Moon and Drubin , Ref . 17 ) suggesting that it may be part of a regu - lated signal transduction mechanism controlling the assembly of the actin cytoskeleton . The original protein of this type , ADF , 1 got its name “actin depolymerizing factor” by virtue of its ability to depolymerize actin filaments . Similar evidence led to the name depactin . However , cofilin copolymerizes with actin at pH , 7 . 3 , depolym - erizing filaments only at higher pH ( 18 , 19 ) . Subsequent work has not led to a consistent view of the mechanism of action of ADF / cofilin proteins . A variety of evidence suggested that ADF / cofilin proteins sever actin filaments and hasten depolymeriza - tion by creating more ends to dissociated subunits ( 2 , 18 – 20 ) . Carlier et al . ( 21 ) questioned the severing activity of the ADF / cofilin family and proposed a “dynamizing” mechanism for plant cofilin . Their interpretation was that plant cofilin pro - motes actin filament turnover by increasing the rates of ATP - actin association at the barbed end and ADP - actin dissociation at the pointed end . Either by severing or enhancing dissociation of subunits from the pointed end , ADF / cofilin proteins should release Mg - ADP - actin monomers , which bind actophorin and cofilin with higher affinity than ATP - actin ( 21 , 22 ) . Both porcine brain and yeast cofilin inhibit the exchange of Mg - ATP bound to actin ( 23 , 24 ) . The effect of ADF / cofilin proteins on ADP exchange is not known , but high affinity binding might trap ADP - actin bound to an ADF / cofilin protein . Using a new fluorescence anisotropy assay , we confirm the higher affinity of actophorin for Mg - ADP - actin than Mg - ATP - actin and characterize in detail the effect of both actophorin and profilin on the exchange of the bound nucleotide . Without profilin , actophorin forms a stable complex with ADP - actin . Profilin competes with actophorin for binding actin monomers . Even with saturating concentrations of actophorin , a low con - centration of profilin promotes the rapid exchange of ADP for ATP . Given the higher affinity of Mg - ATP - actin for profilin , these reactions rapidly transfer actin from actophorin to profi - lin , allowing actophorin to recycle back to actin filaments . We also show that actophorin bound to ADP - or ATP - actin does not inhibit actin filament elongation at either the barbed or pointed end of filaments . MATERIALS AND METHODS Reagents— Materials came from the following sources : Sigma , dithi - othreitol ( DTT ) , EDTA , Tris , sodium azide , Me 2 SO , hexokinase , ATP , ADP , phalloidin , Sephadex G - 25 medium ; Molecular Probes ( Eugene , OR ) , 1 , N 6 - ethenoadenosine - 5 9 - diphosphate ( e - ADP ) , TCEP ( Tris - ( 2 - car - boxyethyl ) phosphine , 5 9 - tetramethylrhodamine maleimide isomer ; Whatman ( Maidstone , United Kingdom ) , DEAE - cellulose DE - 52 . Preparation of Mutant Actophorins— Residues Asn - 33 , Glu - 70 , and Ser - 88 of actophorin were changed to cysteine by reverse polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis ( 25 ) , and the mutations were verified by sequencing . These cysteines were the only reactive sulfhydryls , because neither of the two native cysteines are accessible to solvent ( 26 ) . Wild type and mutant actophorins in plasmid vector pMW172 were ex - pressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 ( DE3 ) pLysS and purified according to Quirk et al . ( 27 ) , except that 2 m M dithiothreitol was included in all buffers for mutant actophorins to avoid cysteine oxida - tion . Purified actophorins were stored in 10 m M Tris - Cl , pH 7 . 5 , 1 m M EDTA , 2 m M DTT , 1 m M NaN 3 . Preparation of Fluorescent Conjugates— A 4 - ml sample of 50 m M actophorin in storage buffer was dialyzed 3 h into labeling buffer ( 10 m M Tris - Cl , pH 7 . 5 , 1 m M EDTA , 2 m M TCEP , 1 m M NaN 3 ) and then reacted with 7 - fold molar excess of 5 9 - tetramethylrhodamine maleimide isomer from a 20 m M stock in Me 2 SO for 2 h at 4 °C with gentle stirring . Centrifugation removed precipitated dye . Two steps removed free dye : first , gel filtration on a 60 3 1 . 5 - cm column Sephadex G25 equilibrated with 10 m M Tris - Cl , pH 7 . 5 , 1 m M EDTA , 2 m M DTT , 250 m M NaCl , 1 m M NaN 3 , at 4 °C ; and second , chromatography on a 13 3 1 . 5 - cm column of DEAE - cellulose DE - 52 equilibrated with 10 m M Tris - HCl , pH * This work was supported by National Institutes of Health Grant GM 26338 ( to T .

Labeled protein was eluted with a 0 – 250 m M gradient of NaCl and dialyzed overnight against 10 m M Tris - Cl , pH 7 . 5 , 1 m M EDTA , 2 m M DTT , 1 m M NaN 3 . Protein purity was confirmed by SDS - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( 15 % acryl - amide ) , and protein concentration was determined by a solid phase dye binding method ( 28 ) . Other Proteins— Profilin - II was purified from Acanthamoeba castel - lanii ( 29 ) . Actin was purified from rabbit muscle acetone powder ( 30 ) or from Acanthamoeba ( 31 ) and isolated as Ca - ATP - G - actin through Sephacryl S - 300 chromatography ( 32 ) at 4 °C in G buffer ( 5 m M Tris - Cl , pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 2 m M ATP , 0 . 1 m M CaCl 2 , 0 . 5 m M DTT ) . Actin was labeled on Cys - 374 to a stoichiometry of 0 . 8 – 1 . 0 with pyrene iodoacetamide ( Ref . 33 , as modified by Pollard ; see Ref . 31 ) . Mg - ATP G - actin was prepared on ice by addition of 0 . 2 m M EGTA and an 11 - fold molar excess of MgCl 2 over actin and used within hours . Mg - ADP G - actin was prepared by treatment of Mg - ATP G - actin with soluble hexokinase and glucose ( 31 ) . Binding of Actophorin to Actin Monomers— For binding experiments , variable concentrations of actin were mixed with a fixed concentration of rhodamine - S88C - actophorin . Fluorescence measurements were made with a PTI Alpha - scan spectrofluorimeter ( Photon Technologies International , South Brunswick , NJ ) . Fluorescence anisotropy of rho - damine - S88C - actophorin was measured with excitation at 550 nm and emission at 574 nm . 2 Data were analyzed using Kaleidagraph software ( Synergy Software , Reading , PA ) and fitted to Eq . 1 where r is the observed anisotropy , r acf is the anisotropy of free actophorin , r acb is the anisotropy of actophorin bound to actin , [ C ] is the total concentration of actophorin , [ A ] is the total concentration of actin and K d the dissociation equilibrium constant of the complex . r 5 r acf 1 ~ r acb 2 r acf !

Seeds were diluted 10 – 50 times into F buffer with 15 m M actophorin and 4 m M pyrenyl - labeled Mg - ADP - or Mg - ATP - actin . The time course of polymerization was measured by fluorescence with excitation at 366 nm and emission at 387 nm . Effect of Actophorin and Profilin on Nucleotide Exchange from Ac - tin— The dissociation Mg - e - ADP from actin muscle monomers was measured by the decrease in fluorescence with excitation at 360 nm and emission at 410 nm . A Hi - tech SFA - II rapid mixer allowed mixing of equal volumes of 600 m M ATP from one syringe with 2 . 8 m M Mg - e - ADP - actin , 6 m M actophorin , and various concentrations of Acanthamoeba profilin - II from the other syringe . Sedimentation Equilibrium— Sedimentation equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation was carried out in a Beckman model XL - I in 6 - hole , charcoal - filled centerpieces with quartz windows in a Beckman model An60ti rotor . We determined the molecular weight and the ratio of rhodamine to actophorin after centrifugation to equilibrium at 14 , 000 rpm . The protein concentration was determinate by Raleigh interferom - etry assuming 3 . 3 fringes per mg / ml protein and the rhodamine con - centration was measured by absorbance at 541 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of 91 , 400 cm 2 1 M 2 1 . We analyzed competitive binding of 10 m M rhodamine - S88C - actophorin and various concentra - tions of profilin - II to 10 m M Mg - ADP - actin monomers by sedimentation equilibrium . We monitored rhodamine absorption at 550 nm . The data was collected and analyzed according to ( 35 ) . Data were fit using Eq . 2 ln ~ absorbance , 550 nm ! 5 ~ s ~ r 2 / 2 2 r 2 m / 2 ! ! ( Eq . 2 ) where the logarithm of the absorbance is a function of the effective reduced molecular weight s5 M v 2 ~ 1 2 v # r ! RT ( Eq . 3 ) M is molecular mass ( g / mol ) , v is the angular velocity ( rad / sec ) , v¯ is the partial specific volume ( cm 3 / gm ) , r is the solvent density ( gm / cm 3 ) , R is the gas constant , and T is the absolute temperature ( K ) , and r m and r are the radii of the meniscus and the bottom of the sample cell , respectively . Simulation of Kinetics and Steady State— We used KINSIM ( 36 ) to simulate the time course of actin nucleotide exchange in presence of actophorin and profilin and the redistribution of actophorin / Mg - ADP - actin monomer complex at steady state . RESULTS Characterization of Rhodamine - Actophorin—Acanthamoeba actophorin has two cysteines , Cys - 9 and Cys - 60 ( 27 ) , but nei - ther reacts with rhodamine maleimide when the protein is folded in its native conformation . To label actophorin with rhodamine , we replaced Asn - 33 , Glu - 70 , or Ser - 88 individually with cysteine ( Fig . 1 ) . We chose these residues for three rea - sons : ( a ) each is outside the actin binding site mapped for other members of the ADF / cofilin family ( 37 – 40 ) ; ( b ) each is a serine in at least one member of the family 26 ; and ( c ) each is exposed to solvent in the crystal structure ( 26 ) . Actophorin labeled with 5 9 - rhodamine maleimide isomer on any of the new cysteines has the same mobility on SDS - poly - acrylamide gel electrophoresis as unlabeled actophorin ( Fig . 2 A , lanes 1 – 6 ) . Rhodamine maleimide labels mutants E70C and S88C ( Fig . 2 A , lanes 4 and 5 ) more efficiently than N33C ( Fig . 2 A , lane 6 ) . By sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifu - gation rhodamine - S88C - actophorin is a single ideal species with a molecular weight of 15 , 200 ( Fig . 2 B ) . In this experiment , the ratio of rhodamine ( measured by A 550 ) to protein ( measured by Rayleigh interferometry ) is constant across the ultracentri - fuge cell with 0 . 44 dyes per protein molecule ( Fig . 2 B ) . If conjugation of the dye with the protein affects its extinction coefficient , the stoichiometry will be different , but in any case , the labeled protein is homogeneous . A second experiment gave similar results . The labeled mutant proteins are indistinguish - able from wild type actophorin in their ability to reduce the low shear viscosity of actin filaments ( data not shown ) using the falling ball assay ( 1 , 2 ) . The fluorescence polarization aniso - tropy r of rhodamine - labeled S88C and E70C is 0 . 14 independ - ent of the concentration , as expected for a 14 - kDa monomeric protein ( 41 ) . Labeling of N33C never exceeded 0 . 1 dye per protein , so we did not use this mutant .

Actophorin Binding Actin Monomers 25107 a t Y a l e U n i v e r s i t y on M a r c h 26 , 2009 www . j b c . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m actophorin mutants , we could use fluorescence anisotropy to determine the affinity of actophorin for monomeric actin . The anisotropy of rhodamine - S88C - actophorin is 0 . 14 when free and 0 . 21 when bound to actin monomers . Under all of the conditions tested , a bimolecular binding isotherm with a stoi - chiometry of 1 : 1 fit the dependence of the anisotropy on actin concentration ( Fig . 3 ) . The nucleotide bound to actin has a strong effect on the affinity of actophorin for actin monomers ( Table I ) . At physio - logical ionic strength ( 2 m M MgCl 2 , 100 m M KCl ) actophorin binds Mg - ADP - actin monomers 40 times stronger than Mg - ATP - actin ( Fig . 3 ) , as observed with other assays ( 22 ) and other members of the ADF / cofilin family ( 21 ) . In contrast , in low salt concentration actophorin binds Mg - ATP - actin monomers bet - ter than Mg - ADP - actin . Rhodamine - S88C - actophorin binds Acanthamoeba and rabbit skeletal muscle actin monomers with similar affinities . Actophorin Is Not a Sequestering Protein— To test the ability of actophorin to sequester actin monomers , we measured the rates of elongation from actin filament seeds stabilized with an excess of phalloidin . Phalloidin prevents actophorin binding to the filaments , 3 so that the actophorin added to the polymeriz - ing mixture was in a simple equilibrium with 4 m M actin mono - mers and actophorin did not quench the fluorescence of newly polymerized pyrene - actin ( 21 ) . After the addition of the com - plex of actophorin with Mg - ATP - or Mg - ADP - actin monomers to the end of a filament , phalloidin binds , induces rapid disso - ciation of actophorin and allows the fluorescence increase as - sociated with pyrenyl - actin polymerization . Elongation is pri - marily at the barbed end of free seeds and exclusively at the pointed end of seeds capped with gelsolin . Excess actophorin has no effect on the rate or extent of elongation at either end by Mg - ATP - actin ( Fig . 4 A ) in agree - ment with the observations of Carlier et al . ( 21 ) but slightly increases the rate of elongation at both ends by Mg - ADP - actin ( Fig . 4 B ) . These experiments show that actophorin does not sequester actin monomers in the sense that bound actophorin does not inhibit subunit addition at either end of actin filaments . Competitive Binding of Actophorin and Profilin to Mg - ADP Actin— We analyzed competition of profilin and actophorin for binding to actin monomers by sedimentation equilibrium ultra - centrifugation ( Fig . 5 ) . At equilibrium , labeled actophorin dis - tributes with actin . Unlabeled profilin displaces labeled acto - phorin from actin in a concentration - dependent fashion . This confirms less direct chemical cross - linking experiments ( 2 ) , which suggested that binding of actophorin and profilin to actin monomers is mutually exclusive . Thus , although actophorin does not sequester actin monomers from polymerization , it does inhibit interactions with at least one other ligand , profilin . Effect of Actophorin and Profilin on Nucleotide Dissociation from Actin— Saturating concentrations of actophorin inhibit Mg - ADP dissociation from muscle actin by a factor 13 to a rate constant of 0 . 006 s 2 1 in buffer with 2 m M MgCl 2 ( Fig . 6 A , inset ) . This is similar to the effect of cofilin on ATP dissociation from actin monomers ( 18 , 24 , 42 ) . Profilin reverses this effect of actophorin , increasing the rate of nucleotide exchange from actin - actophorin complex in a concentration dependent manner ( Fig . 6 A ) . 3 L . Blanchoin and T .

A represents nucleotide - free actin , N nucleotide ATP or ADP , C actophorin , and P profilin . Remarkably , this simple mechanism and the rate and equilibrium constants measured here and in previous work ( 43 ) 2 account quantitatively for the time course ( Fig . 6 A ) and rate ( Fig . 6 B ) of ADP exchange in the presence of actophorin and a wide range of profilin concentrations . Two constants were unknown : k 1 3 is the rate constant for nucleo - tide binding the complex of nucleotide - free actin monomer with actophorin , and K 4 is the association equilibrium constant for actophorin binding nucleotide - free actin . Using measured equi - librium constants and detailed balance , we estimated these values to be 1 . 5 m M 2 1 s 2 1 for k 1 3 and 3 . 8 m M 2 1 for K 4 . The available data did not constrain these constants further , be - cause variation of the values of these constants 6 a factor of 10 does not affect the simulated time course of nucleotide exchange . DISCUSSION Comparison of Methods to Measure Actophorin Binding to Actin Monomers— The present work is the first measurement of the affinity of actophorin for actin . Maciver et al . ( 44 ) and Maciver and Weeds ( 22 ) estimated the affinity of actophorin for actin by a change in critical concentration measured by pyrene fluorescence and light scattering or by gel filtration . However , Carlier et al . ( 21 ) showed ( and we confirm 3 ) that ADF - family proteins quench the fluorescence of pyrene - actin when they bind actin filaments . Carlier et al . ( 21 ) used quenching of NBD - actin fluorescence to study the interaction of ADF1 from Ara - bidopsis thaliana with muscle actin monomers . In our hands , actophorin binding did not affect the fluorescence of NBD - actin monomers , so we used anisotropy to study the interaction of actophorin and actin monomers . This approach has the advan - tage that the fluorescent dye is placed outside of the binding site where it does not interfere with binding . Assays dependent on a change in fluorescence are more convenient and sensitive , but changes in fluorescence are likely to result from direct or indirect interactions of the fluorophore with the ligand and thus may influence the reaction being studied . Thus fluores - cence anisotropy has some advantages , and the labeled protein can also be used for observations in live cells . Effect of Nucleotide on Actophorin Binding to Actin— The fluorescence anisotropy assay confirms that interaction of ac - tophorin with both cytoplasmic and muscle actin monomers depends on the nucleotide bound to actin . At physiological ionic strength , actophorin binds Mg - ADP - actin tightly ( K d 5 0 . 15 m M ) but Mg - ATP - actin weakly ( K d 5 5 . 9 m M ) . These values are in the range estimated by Maciver and Weeds ( 22 ) and agree with the affinity of ADF1 for muscle actin monomers ( 21 ) . The bound nucleotide also affects the affinity of monomeric actin for other proteins . Some proteins like thymosin - b 4 and profilin bind ATP - actin monomers more tightly ( 45 , 46 ) , 2 and others like ADF1 , actophorin , and gelsolin bind ADP actin monomers more tightly ( 21 , 22 , 47 ) . Because the atomic structures of ATP - and ADP - actin bound to DNase I are nearly identical ( 48 ) , it is S CHEME 1 F IG . 4 . Analysis of the actin monomer sequestering activity of actophorin by elongation of actin seeds . Conditions : 10 m M Tris - Cl , pH 8 . 0 , 50 m M KCl , 1 m M MgCl 2 , 1 m M EGTA , 0 . 5 m M DTT , 0 . 1 m M CaCl 2 , 0 . 2 m M ATP , 3 m M NaN 3 . Samples contained either no ( open symbols ) or 15 m M actophorin ( filled symbols ) . Seeds with both ends free for elongation ( squares and triangles ) were prepared by polymerizing 20 m M actin with 200 m M phalloidin for 2 h at 25 °C . Seeds with capped barbed ends and free pointed ends ( circles ) were prepared by polymer - izing 20 m M actin with 200 m M phalloidin and 0 . 4 m M actin / gelsolin seeds for 2 h at 25 °C . A , elongation by Mg - ATP - actin monomers was initiated by mixing concentrated polymerizing buffer and a 50 - fold dilution of actin seeds with 4 m M muscle pyrenyl - Mg - ATP actin monomers ( M , E ) or Acanthamoeba pyrenyl - Mg - ATP actin monomers ( (cid:130) ) alone or in presence of 15 m M actophorin ( f , l , (cid:140) ) . The thick line is the time course of polymerization of 4 m M muscle Mg - ATP - actin monomers without seeds . B , elongation by Mg - ADP - actin monomers was initiated by mix - ing concentrated polymerizing buffer and a 10 - fold dilution of actin seeds with muscle pyrenyl - Mg - ADP actin monomers ( M , E ) alone or in the presence of actophorin ( f , l ) .

Actophorin Binding Actin Monomers 25109 a t Y a l e U n i v e r s i t y on M a r c h 26 , 2009 www . j b c . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m unclear why the nucleotide should have such a large effect on affinity of actophorin and related proteins for actin monomers . The structure of actophorin - G - actin complex will be required to give the answer . Actophorin has the same affinity for muscle and amoeba actin monomers , unlike profilin , which binds better to amoeba actin . 2 This is convenient , because muscle actin is somewhat easier to purify . Unfortunately the situation is different with actin filaments where actophorin binds much better to muscle than amoeba actin . 3 Clearly , every case requires a direct com - parison to establish whether muscle and cytoplasmic actins interact the same with test proteins . Effect of Actophorin on Elongation— Actophorin was origi - nally thought to make a nonpolymeric complex with actin ( 1 , 2 ) , but Carlier et al . ( 21 ) called this into question . They showed that multiple effects of ADF / cofilin proteins on actin filaments complicate the design and interpretation of polymerization ex - periments . Our new assay ( Fig . 5 ) clarifies the effects of acto - phorin on actin filament elongation . We used phalloidin to inhibit binding of actophorin to actin filaments ( 2 ) , 3 so that all added actophorin bound actin monomers and none bound actin filament seeds or elongating pyrene actin filaments . This is essential to avoid quenching of the pyrene fluorescence of the polymerized actin by actophorin . Phalloidin binds actin fila - ments relatively slowly ( 49 ) , but a concentration of 4 m M will bind with a half - time of 1 s , faster than the rate of phosphate release from ADP - P i - actin subunits in filaments ( 50 ) . Acto - phorin does not bind ADP - P i - actin filaments ( 2 ) . Actin monomers saturated with actophorin still elongate both ends of actin filament seeds . Actophorin has no effect on the rate of elongation at either filament end by Mg - ATP - actin in 100 m M KCl . Carlier et al . ( 21 ) reported that plant ADF1 increases the rate of muscle actin filament elongation 20 - fold at low ionic strength but not in 400 m M KCl . ADP - actin saturated with actophorin consistently elongates both filament ends slightly faster than ADP - actin alone . The pointed end reaction is not diffusion limited ( 51 ) , so actophorin may alter the con - formation of actin monomers in a way that favors association . Competition of Actophorin and Profilin for Binding Actin Monomers— Profilin and actophorin compete for binding actin monomers , suggesting that their actin binding sites overlap . This fits well with the proposal of Hatanaka et al . ( 9 ) that the actophorin relative , destrin , binds between subdomains 1 and 3 of actin , directly overlapping the profilin binding site . However , a reconstruction of actin filaments with bound cofilin ( 34 ) does not support this model . Instead , cofilin appears to bind along the two start actin filament helix , interacting with two adja - cent actin subunits : one at a site between subdomains 1 and 3 F IG . 6 .

Effect of profilin on the simulated time course of the redistribution of actophorin / Mg - ADP - actin monomer complex at steady state . We used Scheme 1 and K d 5 5 . 9 m M for actophorin binding to Acanthamoeba ADP - actin filaments 3 to simulate the time course of the redistribution of 0 . 4 m M actophorin bound to Mg - ADP - actin monomers when added to a steady - state mixture of proteins at time 0 . ( l , f ) actophorin bound to Mg - ADP - actin monomers , ( E , M ) actophorin bound to ADP - actin filaments . ADP - actin monomers leaving the complex with actophorin are converted to ATP - actin . In the absence of profilin ( circles ) , the initial steady - state mixture contained 5 m M ATP - actin monomers , 100 m M ADP - actin filaments capped at both ends , 18 . 5 m M actophorin bound to actin filaments , 1 . 5 m M free actophorin , 5 m M ATP , and 0 . 1 m M ADP . In the presence of profilin ( squares ) , the initial steady - state mixture contained all of the same components as well as 5 m M free profilin and 95 m M profilin bound to ATP - actin .

More detailed structures of actin bound to ADF / cofilin proteins will be required to un - derstand the competitive interactions of actophorin and profilin . Effect of Actophorin and Profilin on Nucleotide Exchange— Saturating concentrations of actophorin reduce 13 - fold the rate of MgADP exchange for ATP on actin monomers , similar to the effect of brain cofilin ( 42 ) and yeast cofilin ( 24 ) on ATP ex - change . We assume that the rate of ADP dissociation is rate - limiting , as in other actin nucleotide exchange reactions . Given the 20 m M concentration of actophorin in Acanthamoeba and its higher affinity for MgADP - actin monomers than filaments , 3 a large pool of monomeric ADP - actin might be bound to acto - phorin if dissociation of ADP were slow . To examine the fate of ADP - actin / actophorin as it is released from depolymerizing filaments , using KINSIM and the meas - ured rate and equilibrium constants , we simulated what hap - pens when 0 . 4 m M ADP - actin / actophorin is added to a steady - state mixture of cellular concentrations of actin monomers , actin filaments , actophorin , ATP , and ADP ( Fig . 7 ) . In the absence of profilin the reaction has two phases . In less than 1 s the actophorin distributes about equally between ADP - actin monomers and ADP - actin filaments . This is followed by slow ( t 1 / 2 5 30 s ) exchange of ADP for ATP in the actin monomer pool . Cellular concentrations of profilin accelerate the slow phase ( Fig . 7 ) . Profilin promotes the exchange of ADP for ATP on actin monomers , rapidly depleting the pool of high affinity ADP - actin / actophorin complex . This allows actophorin to redis - tribute rapidly ( t 1 / 2 5 3 s ) back to actin filaments and actin monomers to form a high affinity ATP - actin complex with profilin , ready for rapid elongation of actin filament barbed ends . Our new information regarding monomer binding , filament elongation , and nucleotide exchange focuses attention on inter - actions of actophorin with actin filaments . This is in accord with the effects of mutations in yeast cofilin . Mutations that inhibit binding to actin filaments but not actin monomers are lethal or temperature - sensitive ( 24 ) . Actophorin binds with high affinity to ADP - actin monomers , the species likely to be released from depolymerizing actin filaments . In a simple sys - tem with these two proteins , actophorin would build up a pool of ADP - actin monomers . However , in the presence of profilin , ADP - actin / actophorin released from filaments is only a transi - tory state . Released actophorin quickly recycles back to actin filaments and the ADP - monomers enter the ATP - actin / profilin pool . Under physiological conditions , actophorin does not ap - pear from its biochemical properties to have the capacity to sequester a large pool of actin monomers in the cell either by blocking elongation or inhibiting nucleotide exchange . More likely its role is to stimulate filament turnover , either by sev - ering filaments or increasing the rate of subunit dissociation or both . ATP hydrolysis within the filament and dissociation of the g phosphate are essential as a timer for actophorin binding ( 2 ) , singling out older actin filaments for depolymerization .
