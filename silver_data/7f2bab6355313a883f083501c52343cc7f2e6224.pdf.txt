Since epidermis represents a barrier against infectious agents and balanced apoptosis is essential in epidermal homeostasis , we explored if mycolactone A / B induces apoptosis on two human keratinocyte populations , stem cells ( KSC ) and transit amplifying cells ( TAC ) , and on human keratinocyte line , HaCaT . Treatment of TAC with 1 and 10 ng / ml mycolactone - induced 60 and 90 % apoptosis . KSC were more resistant than TAC : 50 and 75 % of cells underwent apoptosis after 10 and 100 ng / ml toxin - treatment . Higher doses ( 1000 ng / ml ) induced about 30 % apoptosis on HaCaT . In contrast , mycolactone A / B was devoid of toxicity neither on human hepatoma HuH7 nor on human embryonic kidney HEK 293 T cell lines . In conclusion , mycolactone induces apoptosis in human keratinocytes , thus contributing to Buruli ulcer lesions development . (cid:1) 2010 Institut Pasteur . Published by Elsevier Masson SAS .

Introduction Buruli ulcer is a severe infection caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans that affects skin , muscle and bone . In 1999 a poly - ketide toxin called mycolactone produced by M . ulcerans was puriﬁed and characterized . Recently it has been shown that mycolactone induces tissue destruction through apoptosis in both animal models and human tissues [ 1 e 3 ] . The effect of M . ulcerans toxin on some murine and human cell types has been reported : in particular , mycolactone induces apoptosis or necrosis on inﬂammatory cells such as neutrophils and macrophages , T cells , ﬁbroblasts and adipocytes [ 4 e 6 ] . Although epidermis may represent the ﬁrst barrier against M . ulcerans infection , the toxicity of mycolactone on human keratinocytes has not yet been investigated . The human epidermis maintains a constant cellular turnover based on the presence in the basal layer of a population of kera - tinocyte stem cells ( KSC ) that retains a high capacity of self - renewal throughout life . KSC generate transit amplifying cells ( TAC ) that , after a discrete number of cell divisions , ﬁnally differentiate in terminal keratinocytes of the stratum corneum . Epidermal keratinocytes with the characteristics of KSC or TAC can be identiﬁed and isolated in vitro through their adhesion property on type IV collagen . KSC , which express the highest levels of b 1 integrin , rapidly adhere to collagen IVand display the greatest colony - forming efﬁciency [ 7 ] . Instead , TAC , expressing lower amounts of b 1 integrin , slowly adheres to collagen IV [ 8 ] . Apoptosis plays a fundamental role in epidermal homeostasis by counterbalancing cell proliferation , thus maintaining the proper cell number . In the epidermis , apoptosis can be induced by different stimuli and it can also be physiologically activated . * Corresponding author . Tel . : þ 39 0321 660640 ; fax : þ 39 0321 620421 .

It has been shown that KSC , which most rapidly adhere to collagen IV , are more protected from apoptosis by survival signals generated via integrin activation , than TAC . In fact apoptotic keratinocytes are almost undetectable in KSC ( about 5 % ) , whereas they are signiﬁcantly more numerous in TAC ( about 15 % ) ( [ 9 ] and our unpublished data ) . In our study , we investigate the apoptotic action of myco - lactone A / B in primary human keratinocytes KSC and TAC , and in the human keratinocyte cell line HaCaT . A recent study reported that in experimentally infected mice , mycolactone diffuses from infected tissues into internal organs , such as liver , kidneys and spleen [ 10 ] . Since liver and kidneys are emunctory organs involved in the detoxiﬁcation process , we also examine if mycolactone can affect survival of human hepatic and kidney cell lines . Our data demonstrate that mycolactone displays speciﬁc cytotoxicity against epidermal cells invitro byinducing apoptosis . 2 . Materials and methods 2 . 1 . Cell cultures Primary human keratinocytes were obtained from biopsy specimens from dorsal skin ( informed consent was obtained from each donor ) . The ﬁve healthy donors , aged 40 e 50 yrs , were not affected from recognised dermatological diseases . Specimens were incubated at 4 (cid:2) C overnight in dispase II ( Roche Diagnostics Corporation , Indianapolis , IN , USA ) . Weak enzymatic digestion allowed the epidermis to easily detach from the underlying dermis . Isolated keratinocytes were obtained by incubating the epidermal sheet into 0 . 25 % trypsin / 0 . 02 % EDTA solution ( Sigma , St . Louis , MO , USA ) at 37 (cid:2) C for 15 min [ 11 ] . KSC and TAC were separated using their distinct adhesion property : isolated keratinocytes were ﬁrst plated onto plastic dishes coated with 100 m g / ml collagen IV ( Sigma , St . Louis , MO , USA ) . Keratinocytes which were adherent to collagen - coated dishes after 5 min were considered KSC . The non - adherent keratinocytes were then transferred to fresh collagen - coated dishes and allowed to adhere overnight ( TAC ) . Finally , kerati - nocytes which were not yet adherent after one night were dis - carded ( terminal differentiated keratinocytes ) . Both KSC and TAC were then cultured in keratinocyte growth medium ( KGM , Clonetics , San Diego , CA , USA ) . The spontaneously transformed keratinocyte cell line HaCaT ( CLS , Cell Lines Service , Eppelheim , Germany ) , the human hepatoma cell line HuH7 ( ECACC , European Collection of Cell Cultures , London , UK ) and the human epithelial embryonic kidney cells HEK 293 T ( 293tsA1609neo ) ( ATCC , American Type Culture Collection , Rockville , MD , USA ) were cultured in Dulbecco modiﬁed Eagle’s medium ( DMEM ) , supplemented with 10 % foetal calf serum ( FCS ) and antibiotics . 2 . 2 . Treatments KSC and TAC primary keratinocytes were cultured until subconﬂuence , then treated with increasing concentrations of mycolactone A / B ( 0 . 1 e 100 ng / ml ) for 24 h in KGM . ( We chose not to treat terminal differentiated keratinocytes with mycolactone A / B , since very high levels of apoptosis are physiological in this population . ) HaCaT , HuH7 and HEK 293 T were cultured until subconﬂuence , then treated with myco - lactone A / B ( 0 . 1 e 1000 ng / ml ) for 24 h in DMEM plus 10 % FCS , unless otherwise stated . Mycolactone A / B is the most potent of the M . ulcerans macrolides and is produced by almost all M . ulcerans strains [ 12 ] . Mycolactone A / B ( about 3 : 2 ratio ) , isolated from M . ulcerans 1615 was obtained from P . L . Small [ 1 , 13 , 14 ] , solubilized in 95 % ethanol at 1 mg / ml and diluted in cell media . As a control , all cell types were treated with the same ethanol volumes . 2 . 3 . Irradiation of cells with ultraviolet B radiation As internal known apoptosis control , we irradiated KSC , TAC , HaCaT , HuH7 and HEK 293 T with ultraviolet B radi - ation ( UVB ) . Before KSC and TAC irradiation , KGM was discarded and replaced with medium depleted of growth factors and bovine pituitary extract . Likewise , before HaCaT , HuH7 and HEK 293 T irradiation , DMEM plus 10 % FCS was discarded and replaced with serum - free DMEM . Cells were irradiated with UVB at the doses of 10 , 25 , 50 , 75 mJ / cm 2 by Ultraviolet Crosslinker UVC 500 ( Amersham Biosciences , Fairﬁeld , CT , USA ) , cultured for 24 h and then evaluated for the apoptotic rate . 2 . 4 . Detection of apoptotic cells by confocal microscopy After treatments , cells were detached with 5 mM EDTA and seeded on poly - L - lysine - coated coverslips . Cells were ﬁxed in methanol / water ( 80 : 20 ) and stained with propidium iodide ( Sigma , 5 m g / ml in PBS ) [ 15 ] . Coverslips were rinsed and mounted onto glass slides in glycerol / PBS ( 1 : 1 ) and examined in a Leica confocal microscopy system ( True Confocal Scanner Leica TCS SP2 , Leica Microsystem Hei - delberg , Germany ) . Chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation were used as morphological criteria to quantify apoptotic cells . Nuclei were scored and more than 400 nuclei were counted for each sample . The results are expressed as percentage of the number of apoptotic nuclei over the total number of nuclei examined . 2 . 5 . Detection of apoptotic cells by measure of mitochondrial membrane potential Mitochondrial membrane potential was measured by means of the lipophilic cationic probe 5 , 5 0 , 6 , 6 0 - tetrachloro - 1 , 1 0 , 3 , 3 0 - tetraethylbenzimidazol carbocyanine iodide ( JC - 1 probe , Molecular Probes , Eugene , OR , USA ) . This molecule , able to selectively enter the mitochondria , exists in a monomeric form that forms aggregates when the mitochondrial membrane is polarized , with a change in color of the dye from green to greenish orange that can be detected by ﬂow cytometry . After treatment , cells were trypsinized , resuspended , incubated with JC - 1 probe and analyzed by a ﬂow cytometer FACScalibur 1259 C . Bozzo et al . / Microbes and Infection 12 ( 2010 ) 1258 e 1263 Becton e Dickinson ( Franklin Lakes , NJ , USA ) . The results are expressed as percentage of cells with depolarized mitochon - dria over the total number of cells . 2 . 6 . Detection of apoptosis in skin tissues Skin biopsies were taken for diagnostic purpose in subjects affected by Buruli ulcer at the Centre de De´pistage et de Traitment de l 0 Ulce ` re de Buruli ( Allada , Benin ) . The tissues were ﬁxed by 10 % formalin and parafﬁn embedded . The presence of apoptotic cells was investigated on parafﬁn sections by in situ terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase - mediated dUTP - biotin nick - end labelling ( TUNEL ) assay ( Apo Tag Plus Peroxidase kit ) ( Intergene , New York , NY , USA ) [ 16 ] . The reaction product was observed and imaged under an optical microscope . 2 . 7 . Assessment of cell viability HaCat , HuH7 and HEK 293 T cells viability after treat - ments was detected by Trypan Blue exclusion test . Cell count was performed by Countess Automated Cell Counter ( Invi - trogen , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) . 2 . 8 . Measurement of cell metabolic activity by MTT assay After treatments cell lines were incubated with the MTT solu - tion . MTT ( 3 - ( 4 , 5 - Dimethylthiazol - 2 - yl ) - 2 , 5 - diphenyltetrazolium bromide ) , a yellow tetrazole , is reduced to purple formazan in living cells . After solubilization with dimethylsulfoxide , the formazan dye formation was evaluated using a scanning multiwell spectrophotometer at 595 nm . The results are expressed as optical density units ( OD ) . 2 . 9 . Statistical analysis Data are presented as mean (cid:3) SEM of different experi - ments and evaluated by the one - way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) test . 3 . Results Treatment of primary human keratinocytes KSC and TAC with mycolactone A / B induced apoptosis in dose - dependent manner . The evaluation of mycolactone - induced apoptosis either by morphological criteria using confocal microscopy or by the measure of mitochondrial membrane potential gave similar results . TAC were more sensitive to mycolactone toxic effect than KSC : 1 ng / ml mycolactone was able to induce more than 60 % apoptosis and at higher concentrations , 10 and 100 ng / ml , about 90 % of cells were apoptotic . KSC responded to 0 . 1 e 100 ng / ml mycolactone with increasing apoptotic rate , in particular we observed 50 and 75 % of apoptotic KSC at 10 and 100 ng / ml , respectively ( Fig . 1A and C ) . A representative image of KSC treated with the highest mycolactone A / B dose is shown in Fig . 2A . Fig . 1 . Mycolactone A / B induces apoptosis on human keratinocytes . ( A and C ) Primary human transit amplifying ( TAC ) and stem ( KSC ) keratinocytes and ( B and D ) human keratinocyte cell line ( HaCaT ) were treated with increasing mycolactone A / B concentrations for 24 h . Apoptosis was evaluated by confocal laser microscopy after propidium iodide staining ( A and B ) or by analysis of mitochondrial membrane potential ( C and D ) . Data are expressed as mean (cid:3) SEM of ﬁve ( TAC ) , ﬁve ( KSC ) and seven ( HaCaT ) independent experiments and evaluated by ANOVA : TAC and KSC : p ¼ 0 . 0009 ( A ) , p ¼ 0 . 0001 ( C ) ; HaCat : p ¼ 0 . 028 ( B ) , p ¼ 0 . 016 ( D ) . 1260 C . Bozzo et al . / Microbes and Infection 12 ( 2010 ) 1258 e 1263 The effect of M . ulcerans toxin was also investigated on a human keratinocyte cell line , HaCaT . Mycolactone A / B was moderately toxic on these cells . Indeed , about 25 and 30 % of HaCaT cells underwent apoptosis after treatment with 100 and 1000 ng / ml mycolactone , respectively ( Fig . 1B and D ) . Trypan Blue exclusion test ( a wide accepted indicator of cell necrosis ) detected no signiﬁcant variation of cell viability at all myco - lactone concentrations employed ( data not shown ) . To eval - uate if mycolactone , despite the moderate induction of apoptosis , may exert its toxicity otherwise in HaCat , we measured the cell metabolic activity in treated cells : 100 and 1000 ng / ml mycolactone reduced HaCat metabolic activity by about 10 % ( OD ¼ 2 . 93 (cid:3) 0 . 03 , 2 . 60 (cid:3) 0 . 03 and 2 . 59 (cid:3) 0 . 03 at 10 , 100 and 1000 ng / ml , respectively vs 2 . 88 (cid:3) 0 . 01 in control ; p ¼ 0 . 0001 ) . Mycolactone A / B citotoxicity was the same when HaCaT cells were treated in serum - free medium as in presence of FCS ( data not shown ) . Furthermore , we also demonstrated the presence of apoptotic cells in vivo by TUNEL assay . The apoptotic bodies were diffusely distributed in Buruli ulcer tissues , scattered amongst the inﬂammatory cells ( Fig . 2C ) . Mycolactone A / B was devoid of toxicity neither on human hepatoma HuH7 nor on human embryonic kidney HEK 293 T cell lines , whether the treatment was performed in the presence of 10 % FCS or not . We did not detect apoptotic cells after treatment with a wide range ( 0 . 1 e 1000 ng / ml ) of mycolactone . Moreover , HuH7 and HEK 293 T cells viability , assessed by Trypan Blue exclusion test , was never lesser than 90 % and cell metabolic activity , measured by MTT assay , was not inﬂuenced by mycolactone A / B treat - ment ( Table 1 ) . Irradiation with UVB , a known effective apoptotic stim - ulus , induced apoptosis at 50 and 75 mJ / cm 2 , respectively , in both KSC ( 93 . 0 (cid:3) 3 . 9 % and 99 . 0 (cid:3) 0 . 9 % vs 0 % in control ) and TAC ( 98 . 5 (cid:3) 1 . 4 % and 97 . 5 (cid:3) 2 . 5 % vs 12 . 4 (cid:3) 0 . 4 % ) as well as in HaCaT ( 69 . 3 (cid:3) 4 . 0 % and 76 . 3 (cid:3) 4 . 5 % vs 2 . 1 (cid:3) 1 . 1 % ) , HuH7 ( 61 . 8 (cid:3) 5 . 0 % and 64 . 5 (cid:3) 4 . 5 % vs 0 % ) and HEK 293 T ( 75 . 9 (cid:3) 5 . 5 % and 95 . 9 (cid:3) 4 . 0 % vs 0 % ) cell lines ( all p ¼ 0 . 0009 ) . 4 . Discussion Buruli ulcer is acquired from environment by a mechanism involving small aquatic organisms , like hemiptera [ 17 ] , although the exact mode of transmission remains unknown . Fig . 2 . Mycolactone A / B toxicity : representative images of apoptotic human skin cells . Propidium iodide staining and confocal microscopy analysis of primary human stem keratinocytes ( KSC ) : ﬁfteen to eighteen focal frames were taken along the z axis at 300 nm intervals and then merged to obtain a reconstructed image ( 600 (cid:4) ) . Numerous apoptotic cells , which displayed highly ﬂuorescent , condensed nuclei and polarized chromatin aggregates according to an apoptotic phenotype were observed after treatment with 100 ng / ml mycolactone A / B for 24 h ( A ) . Nuclei of control cells displayed typical chromatin morphology with distinct organization ( B ) . Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase - mediated dUTP - biotin nick - end labelling ( TUNEL ) staining in a case of Buruli ulcer . A number of apoptotic cells ( some of these identiﬁed by arrows ) are scattered in an area heavily inﬁltrated by granulocytes . The reaction product was revealed by an immunoperoxidase method ( 220 (cid:4) ) ( C ) . 1261 C . Bozzo et al . / Microbes and Infection 12 ( 2010 ) 1258 e 1263 Insect vectors living in aquatic niches may introduce M . ulcerans into the skin or deposit it on skin surface . Mycolactone A / B induces necrosis and / or apoptosis in mouse ﬁbroblasts and macrophage - like cell lines [ 14 ] , in human adipocytes [ 6 ] and in human macrophages [ 3 ] . In particular , high mycolactone concentrations ( about 15 m g / ml ) induce necrosis , whereas at lower concentrations mycolactone preferably induces apoptosis [ 4 ] . Since epidermis is of course the ﬁrst barrier against envi - ronmental insults and likely against M . ulcerans , we investi - gated the effect of mycolactone A / B on keratinocyte survival . We isolated primary human keratinocytes from skin biopsies and separated them into keratinocyte stem cells ( KSC ) and transit amplifying keratinocytes ( TAC ) by means of their different adhesion properties . KSC and TAC undergo apoptosis after in vitro treatment with mycolactone A / B . KSC are less sensitive to mycolactone - induced apoptosis than TAC . Indeed , relatively low toxin concentrations ( 1 and 10 ng / ml ) are highly cytotoxic on TAC , thus inducing high apoptotic rate . Instead , we observed elevated apoptotic rate on KSC after treatment with higher mycolactone concentration ( 100 ng / ml ) . It is well known that KSC and TAC from unaffected skin undergo apoptosis at different rates , in order to maintain epidermal homeostasis . Physiological apoptosis is very low in human epidermal KSC , since they are protected by the stem cell microenvironment or niche [ 18 ] , while TAC usually have a higher turnover rate . The observed greater vulnerability of TAC to mycolactone - induced apoptosis may be relevant for M . ulcerans infection and for lesion development . Immunohistological analysis of skin biopsy taken from lesional tissue in Buruli ulcer affected patients evidences apoptosis in a wide dermal area . It is important underline that ulcerative tissue lacks epidermal layer . Unfortunately tissue samples of preclinical phases are not available , but we believe that , at the initial asymptomatic stage of infection , the toxin might induce apoptosis in epidermal keratinocytes . Mycolactone A / B induces apoptosis also on the human keratinocyte cell line , HaCaT , notwithstanding the phenom - enon is not remarkable as in primary human keratinocytes . This is not surprising , since we observe that HaCaT cells are more resistant than primary human keratinocytes to different pro - apoptotic stimuli , such as UVB irradiation ( as reported here ) and detachment - induced apoptosis ( anoikis ) ( our unpublished data ) . Therefore it might be that the toxin is able to affect HaCat metabolic activity or engender necrosis : here we demonstrate that mycolactone slowly reduces HaCat metabolic activity and it affects their viability , only through the induction of apoptosis . It may be outlined that caution must be necessary when data obtained on transformed cells are related to primary cells . A recent study reported that following injection , via different routes , of radiolabeled mycolactone or M . ulcerans in mice , the toxin diffuses into blood and accumulates in internal organs , revealing a tropism for spleen , liver and kidneys [ 9 ] . Since liver and kidneys represent the emunctory organs and receive the majority of cardiac output , we decide to test the effect of mycolactone A / B on human hepatic and kidney cells . We observe that mycolactone A / B is devoid of any in vitro toxicity on hepatoma and embryonic kidney cell lines , which instead respond to UVB damage with high levels of apoptotic cells . Notwithstanding the absence of myco - lactone A / B toxicity on hepatoma or kidney cells may be potentially interesting , it must be stated that this evidence might to be limited to these cell line models and to the condition tested . Our data demonstrate that mycolactone A / B displays cytotoxicity for the epidermal cells in vitro : the toxin induces high apoptosis levels in primary human stem and transit amplifying keratinocytes and to a lesser extent in human keratinocyte cell line . The role of mycolactone in the induc - tion of skin ulcers and the mechanism of wound - healing are up to investigate . On the basis of our study it seems that not only the connective and adipose tissues are the targets of the toxic action of mycolactone , but that epidermal keratinocytes may be directly involved in the mechanism of M . ulcerans infection too . The suggested model of infection implies that , initially , M . ulcerans has an intramacrophage proliferation and later an extracellular proliferation [ 19 ] . Mycolactone , produced by M . ulcerans , might diffuse from infected areas to surrounding tissues , such as epidermis , and enter keratinocytes owing to its lipophilic structure .

Bozzo et al . / Microbes and Infection 12 ( 2010 ) 1258 e 1263 The presence of the bacteria in vivo in lesional epidermis was not yet investigated . Recently , an interesting in vitro study reported that keratinocyte toll - like receptors 2 and 4 and dectin - 1 actively sense , internalize M . ulcerans and participate in the innate immune response to the bacteria [ 20 ] . In conclusion , we suggest that the development of Buruli ulcer lesions is not only due to apoptotic and necrotic phenomena in the subcutaneous tissues with the consequent indirect damage of epidermal layers , but also to the direct toxic action of mycolactone on keratinocytes .
