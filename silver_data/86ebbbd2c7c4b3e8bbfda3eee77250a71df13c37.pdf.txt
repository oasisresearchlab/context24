Immunoglobulin domains 58 / 59 ( Ig58 / 59 ) of obscurin bind to a diverse set of proteins that are essential for the proper structure and function of the heart , including giant titin , novex - 3 , and phospholamban ( PLN ) . Importantly , the pathophysiological significance of the Ig58 / 59 module has been further underscored by the discovery of several mutations within Ig58 / 59 that are linked to various forms of myopathy in humans . We previously generated a constitutive deletion mouse model , Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 , that expresses obscurin lacking Ig58 / 59 , and characterized the effects of this deletion on cardiac morphology and function through aging . Our findings demonstrated that Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 male animals develop severe arrhythmia , primarily manifesting as episodes of junctional escape and spontaneous loss of regular p - waves , reminiscent of human atrial fibrillation , accompanied by significant atrial enlargement that progresses in severity with aging . Methods and Results : To comprehensively characterize the molecular alterations responsible for these pathologies , we performed proteomic and phospho - proteomic analyses in aging Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 atria . Our studies revealed extensive and novel alterations in the expression and phosphorylation profile of major cytoskeletal proteins , Ca 2 + regulators , and Z - disk associated protein complexes in the Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 atria through aging . Discussion : These studies implicate obscurin , particularly the Ig58 / 59 module , as an essential regulator of the Z - disk associated cytoskeleton and Ca 2 + cycling in the atria and provide new molecular insights into the development of atrial fibrillation and remodeling . KEYWORDS obscurin , atrial fibrillation , arrhythmia , Z - disk , Ca 2 + cycling , cytoskeleton Introduction Obscurin ( 720 – 870 kDa ) , comprised of 65 – 67 tandemly arranged immunoglobulin ( Ig ) domains , 2 – 3 fibronectin - III motifs , and a unique assortment of signaling domains at its COOH - terminus depending on the isoform , is a giant cytoskeletal protein that localizes to the periphery of M - bands and Z - disks where it modulates diverse structural and regulatory functions in striated muscles ( 1 , 2 ) . Given its large size , modular nature , and unique cellular distribution as a peripheral sarcomeric protein , obscurin is ideally situated to interact with proteins localizing to different cellular compartments , ranging from the sarcomere and the surrounding sarcoplasmic reticulum ( SR ) membranes to the cytoskeleton and the sarcolemma ( 1 , 2 ) . Accordingly , obscurin serves essential roles in the assembly and stabilization of the myofibril , Ca 2 + signaling , cell adhesion , and the physical integration of the sarcomere with the cytoskeleton and surrounding membrane structures ( 1 , 2 ) .

Grogan et al . 10 . 3389 / fcvm . 2023 . 1085840 Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine 02 frontiersin . org Over the past several decades , the discovery of > 20 missense , splicing , and frameshift mutations spanning the entire length of the obscurin gene ( OBSCN ) in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ( HCM ) , dilated cardiomyopathy ( DCM ) , left ventricular non - compaction ( LVNC ) , and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy ( ARVC ) has increasingly implicated obscurin in the development of cardiac disease in humans ( 3 – 5 ) . To date , the disease mechanisms underlying the majority of these mutations have remained entirely uninvestigated , with the exception of the HCM - linked R4344Q variant residing within obscurin Ig58 which our lab has previously characterized ( 6 ) . Our findings demonstrated that mice carrying the R4344Q variant ( Obscn - R4344Q ) exhibited a “gain - of - function” phenotype wherein enhanced binding between mutant Ig58 and phospholamban ( PLN ) resulted in disinhibition of the sarco - endoplasmic reticulum Ca 2 + ATPase ( SERCA ) , increased Ca 2 + cycling kinetics , and the development of ventricular arrhythmia through aging ( 6 ) . The direct binding between obscurin - Ig58 / 59 and PLN and their enhanced association in the presence of the R4344Q variant was recently corroborated by Fukuzawa and colleagues , reporting a ~ 2 . 5 - fold decrease in the K d ; yet , the physiological relevance of the obscurin / PLN interaction was questioned ( 7 ) . As a small modulatory protein that is extensively regulated by phosphorylation and assumes multiple oligomeric conformations in physiological settings , PLN inherently interacts weakly and / or transiently with its binding partners . Thus , technical limitations of different in vitro systems perhaps mask a complex and dynamically regulated ( i . e . , on a beat - to - beat basis ) interaction between obscurin - Ig58 / 59 and PLN . In addition to its binding to PLN , obscurin - Ig58 / 59 has been reported to interact with the extreme NH 2 - terminus of titin ( 3 – 4 MDa ) as well as a unique 198 - amino acid long sequence of titin’s smaller splice variant , novex - 3 ( ~ 700 kDa ) , at the level of the Z - disk ( 8 , 9 ) . Of note , the obscurin / novex - 3 interaction was recently contested by Fukuzawa and colleagues ( 7 ) . Nevertheless , given that obscurin - Ig58 / 59 may interact with a diverse set of structural and regulatory proteins that are essential for normal muscle function , we generated the Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 model that expresses obscurin constitutively lacking Ig58 / 59 to extensively characterize the pathophysiological significance of this region in the heart ( 10 ) . Our studies demonstrated that sedentary Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 males develop severe arrhythmia characterized by frequent episodes of spontaneous junctional escape and atrial fibrillation beginning at 6 - months of age accompanied by significantly increased atrial mass and dilated left ventricles by 12 - months ( 10 ) . Herein , we performed proteomic and phospho - proteomic analysis using 6 - and 12 - month old Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 atria in order to comprehensively investigate the molecular basis for the prominent atrial arrhythmia and remodeling in aging Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 males . Our studies revealed extensive and novel changes in the expression and phosphorylation profile of the Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 atrial proteome , mainly impacting cytoskeletal and signaling complexes at the Z - disk and Ca 2 + regulating proteins . Together , these results provide new molecular insights into the pathophysiology of spontaneous atrial arrhythmia and remodeling . Materials and methods Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 constitutive deletion mice The Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 constitutive deletion model was generated and genotyped as previously described ( 10 ) . Animal care and procedures were conducted under protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Maryland , School of Medicine ( UMSOM ) and in accordance with the NIH guidelines ( Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals ) . Lysate preparation and western blotting Lysates were prepared from flash frozen cardiac tissue and protein expression was evaluated by immunoblotting as previously described ( 10 ) . Briefly , frozen right and left atria were combined , ground to a powder in a glass homogenizer while immersed in liquid nitrogen , and incubated at − 20 ° C for 20 min . The ground tissue was solubilized in urea - thiourea lysis buffer ( 8 mol / L urea , 2 mol / L thiourea , 3 % SDS , 0 . 05 mol / L tris – HCl , 0 . 03 % bromophenol blue , 0 . 075 mol / L dithiothreitol , pH 6 . 8 ) and 50 % glycerol supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors ( Halt Protease and Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail , Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham , MA , United States ) in a 60 ° C water bath . Homogenates were centrifuged and supernatants were aliquoted and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen . For western blotting , equal amounts of protein lysates were thawed at 55 ° C for 5 min , separated by SDS - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis , transferred to nitrocellulose membrane , and probed with the respective primary antibodies . Alkaline phosphatase ( AP ) - conjugated or horseradish peroxidase ( HRP ) - conjugated secondary antibodies and the respective chemiluminescent reagents ( NovaBright ; AP , or Pierce ECL ; HRP ) were used to detect immunoreactive bands . Densitometry was performed using ImageJ and each band was normalized to a loading control ( glyceraldehyde 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase , GAPDH ; heat shock protein 90 , Hsp90 ; or α - actinin ) . At least two technical replicates of at least three different biological samples ( i . e . , hearts ) were quantified per genotype for each protein evaluated . The original representative blots shown in Figures 1 , 2 and 8 are included in Supplementary Image 1 ; please note that in some instances , immunoblots were flipped for ease of presentation .

Louis , MO , United States ) . The following secondary antibodies were used for western blotting : goat anti - mouse IgG ( 1 : 3000 ; A3688 , Sigma - Aldrich ) , goat anti - rabbit IgG ( 1 : 3000 ; AB _ 2337947 , Jackson Immunoresearch , West Grove , PA , United States ) , goat Grogan et al . 10 . 3389 / fcvm . 2023 . 1085840 Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine 03 frontiersin . org anti - mouse IgG ( 1 , 3 , 000 ; CST - 7076S , Cell Signaling Technology ) , and goat anti - rabbit IgG ( 1 , 3 , 000 ; CST - 7074S , Cell Signaling Technology ) . Electrophoresis and Coomassie Blue staining for titin Atrial lysates prepared as described above were separated on 16 × 18 cm gels composed of 1 % agarose in 1X running buffer ( 50 mM tris , 0 . 384 mol / l glycine , 0 . 1 % SDS ) and 30 % glycerol using the Hoefer SE600 unit system at 4 ° C for 3 h as described previously ( 10 ) . Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue and the bands corresponding to giant titin were quantified using ImageJ and normalized to myosin heavy chain ( MHC ) as a loading control . Any digital adjustments to promote visualization of the bands were applied uniformly across the entire gel . At least two technical replicates of three different biological samples ( i . e . , hearts ) were quantified for each genotype . The original representative titin gels shown in Figure 2 are included in Supplementary Image 1 ; please note that in some instances , gels were flipped for ease of presentation . Proteomic and phospho - proteomic analysis Proteomic experiments were performed in the Mass Spectrometry Center at the University of Maryland School of Pharmacy . Atrial tissues dissected from male wild - type and homozygous Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 mice ( n = 5 hearts per group ) were homogenized in phosphate buffered saline using the Precellys CK14 lysing kit ( Bertin Corp . , Rockville , MD , United States ) . Proteins were extracted and purified from tissue lysates by trichloroacetic acid precipitation . Protein concentration was measured by bicinchoninic acid assay as described previously ( 14 ) . Lysates were reduced , alkylated , and trypsinolyzed on a 10 K filter for shotgun proteomics as in ( 15 ) . Phospho - peptides were enriched by TiO 2 affinity chromatography ( Sigma ) . Tryptic peptides were separated by a nanoACQUITY UPLC analytical column on a Waters nano - ACQUITY UPLC system and analyzed with a coupled Thermo Scientific Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Tribrid mass spectrometer as previously described ( 16 ) . In detail , tryptic peptides were separated on a nano - ACQUITY UPLC analytical column ( BEH130 C18 , 1 . 7 μ m , 75 μ m × 200 mm , Waters ) over a 165 - min linear acetonitrile gradient ( 3 – 40 % ) with 0 . 1 % formic acid on a Waters nano - ACQUITY UPLC system and analyzed on a coupled Thermo Scientific Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Tribrid mass spectrometer as previously reported ( 17 ) . Full scans were acquired at a resolution of 120 , 000 and precursors were selected for fragmentation by higher - energy collisional dissociation ( normalized collision energy at 30 % ) for a maximum 3 - s cycle . Tandem mass spectra were searched against a UniProt reference Mus musculus proteome using Sequest HT algorithm ( 18 ) and MS Amanda algorithm ( 19 ) with a maximum precursor mass error tolerance of 10 ppm . Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was treated as static modification . Phosphorylation of serine ( Ser ) , threonine A C C’ A’ B FIGURE 1 Expression levels of obscurin in wild - type and Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 atria .

( C , C’ ) Immunoblotting ( C ) and relative quantification ( C’ ) of giant obscurin in 6 - and 12 - month - old wild - type and Obscn - Δ Ig5859 LV and atria using antibodies to Ig67 indicated that obscurin A expression is unchanged in Obscn - Δ Ig5859 atria compared to wild - type ; t - test , p = 0 . 32 ( 6 - months ) , p = 0 . 36 ( 12 - months ) . Notably , the up - regulation of obscurin B observed in Obscn - Δ Ig5859 LV was barely detectable in Obscn - Δ Ig5859 atria ; n = 3 animals per group ; data points represent the average of at least two technical replicas ; densitometric values were normalized to Hsp90 , which was used as loading control .

Resulting hits were validated at a maximum global false discovery rate ( FDR ) of 0 . 01 using a semi - supervised machine learning algorithm Percolator ( 20 ) . Label - free quantifications were performed using Minora , an aligned AMRT ( Accurate Mass and Retention Time ) cluster quantification algorithm ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , 2017 ) . Label - free quantitation of protein abundances was measured by comparing the MS1 peak volumes of peptide ions , whose identities were confirmed by MS2 sequencing . The above abundance values were imported into Partek GS software for further statistical and bioinformatic analyses ( Transcriptomics and Deep Sequencing Core , Johns Hopkins University ) . There were two mappings of the mass spectra : ( a ) to individual proteins , and ( b ) to unique phospho - peptides , wherein a phospho - peptide represents a unique specific position within its peptide . Both the individual proteins and unique phospho - peptide proteins were annotated with their cognate genes’ approved MGI / NCBI nomenclature . Following log 2 transformation , the abundance values were then quantile normalized for each time point to minimize experimental noise among the lanes that represent replicate samples for the two biological classes ( i . e . , genotypes ) , and the Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 samples were compared to the wild type with two - tailed one - way t - test ANOVA . Each protein or unique phospho - peptide compared received a relative abundance and statistical value , as a fold - change and value of p , and the log 2 fold changes were analyzed to determine their standard deviation from the mean value of no change . Proteins and phospho - peptides with a value of p of < 0 . 05 and log 2 fold A A’ FIGURE 2 Expression and phosphorylation status of Ig58 / 59 binding partners and selected Ca 2 + cycling proteins are unaffected in aged Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 atria .

Results and discussion Immunoblot analysis of aging Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 atria did not reveal significant differences in the levels of obscurin , titin , or canonical Ca 2 + cycling proteins We recently generated a constitutive deletion mouse model , Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 , that expresses obscurin lacking the Ig58 / 59 region and comprehensively evaluated the effects of this deletion on cardiac morphology and function through aging . Our studies showed that male Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 mice exhibit episodes of severe atrial arrhythmia by 6 - months , manifesting as junctional escape and spontaneous loss of regular p - waves ( 10 ) . By 12 - months , the incidence and severity of arrhythmias intensified accompanied by significant atrial enlargement ( 10 ) . Notably , female Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 mice do not exhibit any structural or functional deficiencies through aging and develop only mild arrhythmia that occurs less frequently compared to Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 males ( 10 ) . Therefore , we focus our molecular characterization on Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 males only . To investigate the mechanistic basis for the development of atrial fibrillation and remodeling in aging Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 males , we first evaluated the expression levels of obscurin , the binding partners of obscurin - Ig58 / 59 , and a panel of Ca 2 + regulators that are commonly associated with the development of atrial fibrillation . Earlier studies assessing the expression of obscurin during embryonic development reported reduced obscurin transcript levels in mouse atria compared to ventricles at embryonic day 12 ( 23 ) . However , comparison of obscurin expression between adult atrial and ventricular tissues has not yet been experimentally determined . We therefore performed immunoblotting experiments using lysates prepared from 12 - month - old wild - type hearts but did not observe significant differences in the levels of giant obscurin between the left ventricle and atria ( Figures 1A , A’ ) . We next evaluated the impact of the Ig58 / 59 deletion on atrial obscurin expression in sedentary aging animals . Immunoblotting experiments utilizing antibodies to obscurin - Ig58 / 59 confirmed the absence of this region in lysates generated from 6 - and 12 - month - old Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 atria ( Figure 1B ) . Similar to our prior findings in Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 left ventricles ( 10 ) , antibodies to obscurin - Ig67 did not reveal significant differences in prototypical obscurin A expression between wild - type and Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 atria at 6 - or 12 - months ( Figures 1C , C’ ) . Intriguingly , the up - regulation of obscurin B ( the largest known isoform containing two serine / threonine , Ser / Thr , kinases ) previously reported in Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 left ventricular tissue ( 10 ) was barely detectable in Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 atria ( Figures 1C , C’ ) . This finding indicated that the Ig58 / 59 deletion leads to distinct molecular alterations in Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 atria compared to the ventricle and suggested that Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 atria potentially lack compensatory signaling mechanisms that could be mediated by obscurin - kinase bearing isoforms in Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 left ventricles . We next evaluated the expression and phosphorylation levels of the known binding partners of Ig58 / 59 in addition to select Ca 2 + cycling regulators . Interestingly , there were no statistically significant differences in the levels of giant titin , novex - 3 , PLN or its phosphorylation at Ser16 or Thr17 , small ankyrin 1 ( sAnk1 ) , sarcolipin ( SLN ) , SERCA2 , RyR2 or its phosphorylation at Ser2808 or Ser2814 in Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 atria compared to age - matched controls at either 6 - or 12 - months ( Figures 2A , A’ ) . Therefore , the atrial remodeling and arrhythmia in aging Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 male mice cannot be explained by changes in the expression levels and / or canonical phosphorylation sites of these proteins , as is the case for Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 left ventricles ( 10 ) . This suggested alternative mechanisms in the atria , perhaps involving additional Ca 2 + or cytoskeletal regulators and / or less characterized / novel phosphorylation events . Along these lines , many studies have reported the presence of phosphorylation sites on titin ( 24 ) , RyR2 ( 25 – 27 ) , PLN ( 28 ) , sAnk1 ( 29 ) , and SERCA2 ( 30 ) , for which their ( patho ) physiological impact has not been established . Proteomic and phospho - proteomic analysis revealed deregulated structural and regulatory proteins in aging Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 atria Given the lack of significant alterations in the levels of obscurin , the binding partners of obscurin - Ig58 / 59 , and canonical Ca 2 + cycling regulators , we performed proteomic and phospho - proteomic experiments using 6 - and 12 - month - old male wild - type and Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 atrial tissue ( n = 5 hearts per group ) to obtain a more comprehensive molecular profile of the Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 atria . At 6 - months , we identified 45 proteins ( out of 1700 detected ) that exhibited significantly altered expression levels ( Figure 3A ; Supplementary Table S1 ; Supplementary Data Sheet 1 ) and 30 phospho - peptides ( out of 1 , 401 detected ) originating from 27 different proteins that displayed altered phosphorylation levels ( Figure 3A’ ; Supplementary Table S2 ; Supplementary Data Sheet 2 ) . By 12 - months , we identified 48 proteins ( out of 1708 detected ) with altered expression levels ( Figure 4A ; Supplementary Table S3 ; Supplementary Data Sheet 3 ) and 78 phospho - peptides ( out of 2 , 656 detected ) corresponding to 67 different proteins that exhibited altered phosphorylation levels ( Figure 4A’ ; Supplementary Table S4 ; Supplementary Data Sheet 4 ) . Of the 45 – 48 affected proteins and 27 – 67 affected phospho - proteins in Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 atria , relatively few were commonly deregulated throughout aging ( Figure 5 ) . In order to discover the functional relationships and / or physical associations shared by the deregulated proteins or phospho - proteins in Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 atria through aging , we performed a network analysis using the publicly available STRING database ( v . 11 . 0b ) ( 22 ) . At 6 - months , there was a single network exhibiting a high confidence interaction score ( > 0 . 7 ) among the proteins displaying deregulated expression in Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 atria ( Figure 3B ) , which consisted of ubiquitin - specific protease 14 ( Usp14 ) and the proteasome subunit alpha type - 2 ( Psma2 ) , possibly reflecting deregulated protein degradation pathways . Also connected to this network , albeit with a medium confidence interaction score ( > 0 . 4 ) , is the purine biosynthetic enzyme , phosphoribosylaminoimidizole carboxylase / succinocarboxamide synthetase ( Paics ) , possibly implicating altered DNA synthesis , intracellular signaling , and / or metabolic processes ( 31 ) . On the other hand , STRING analysis of the deregulated phospho - proteins at 6 - months revealed a high confidence network ( Figure 3B’ ) comprised of sarcomeric proteins ( i . e . , titin , Ttn ; myosin light chain 7 , Myl7 ) and cytoskeletal proteins localizing to the Z - disc ( i . e . , myozenin , Myoz2 ; synaptopodin 2 - like , Synpo2l ; LIM domain binding protein 3 , Ldb3 ) . Grogan et al . 10 . 3389 / fcvm . 2023 . 1085840 Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine 07 frontiersin . org This network also included β - taxilin , a muscle - specific member of the taxilin family of vesicular trafficking regulators that is proposed to regulate myoblast differentiation ( 32 ) . At 12 - months , we observed a significant clustering of intermediate filament proteins ( i . e . , keratins , Krt1 , Krt5 , Krt6a , Krt14 , Krt16 , Krt17 ) , in addition to a smaller high confidence network of protein homeostasis regulators ( i . e . , eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 , Eif2s3x ; eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4 gamma 2 , Eif4g2 ; proteasome 20s subunit beta 3 , Psmb3 ; 26S proteasome regulatory subunit 4 , Psmd4 ) that all exhibited reduced expression levels in Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 atria ( Figure 4B ) . Lastly , STRING analysis of the deregulated phospho - proteins at 12 - months revealed an extensive high confidence network comprised of 23 interconnected sarcomeric proteins , cytoskeletal proteins , ion channels , Ca 2 + regulators , and kinases ( Figure 4B’ ) . Of note , titin represents the most prominent node in the phospho - proteomic network at both timepoints , forming functional and / or physical associations with 4 / 6 ( 66 % ) and 10 / 23 ( 43 % ) of the phospho - proteins that were deregulated at 6 - or 12 - months , respectively . Given that titin is a binding partner of the obscurin Ig58 / 59 A A’ B B’ FIGURE 4 Proteomic and phospho - proteomic analysis of Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 atria at 12 - months .

Grogan et al . 10 . 3389 / fcvm . 2023 . 1085840 Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine 08 frontiersin . org module , this suggests that the disruption of the obscurin / titin complex could be integral to the deregulated phosphorylation events in Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 atria . To more quantitatively delineate the major molecular pathways and cellular functions that were impacted by the Ig58 / 59 deletion , we performed an enrichment analysis on the proteins that exhibited significantly altered expression or phosphorylation levels ( Figures 6A , B , 7A , B ; Supplementary Tables S5 – S8 ) . At 6 - months , proteins exhibiting altered expression were associated with the regulation of inositol phosphate metabolism ( Figures 6A , B ; Supplementary Table S5 ) , whereas at 12 - months , proteins exhibiting altered expression largely belonged to the keratin subfamily of intermediate filaments ( Figures 7A , B ; Supplementary Table S7 ) . Additionally , proteins displaying altered phosphorylation were primarily associated with the regulation of cellular assembly / organization ( i . e . , organization of sarcomeres , filaments , and microtubules ) , ion transport , and cardiac hypertrophy at 6 - months ( Figures 6A , B ; Supplementary Table S6 ) and various signaling cascades ( i . e . , protein kinase A ; PKA , integrin , apelin , and Ca 2 + cycling ) , striated muscle development , formation , morphology , and hypertrophy , as well as cardiomyopathy and familial arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia at 12 - months ( Figures 7A , B ; Supplementary Table S8 ) . Given the large number of deregulated proteins and phosphorylation events identified in our proteomic screen , we decided to focus on ( 1 ) direct alterations to obscurin , and ( 2 ) proteins that belong to enriched molecular pathways or cellular functions and represent nodes within high confidence protein networks identified via STRING analysis . Of note , we discuss these deregulated proteins and phospho - proteins in terms of their canonical protein class since many of them belong to multiple affected cellular processes and / or protein interaction networks . Alterations in obscurin in aging Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 atria At 12 - months of age , we observed a significant , yet modest , reduction ( ~ 1 . 8 fold ) in the expression levels of obscurin in Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 atria compared to wild - type ( Figure 4A ; Supplementary Table S3 ) . Of note , the lack of statistical significance in our immunoblotting analysis ( Figures 1C , C’ ) that revealed only a trend toward decreased obscurin expression in Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 atria ( ~ 1 . 1 fold ; p = 0 . 3 ) , is most likely due to the reduced sensitivity of the immunoblotting technique compared to proteomics . Nevertheless , complete knockout or down - regulation of obscurin in striated muscles has been linked to major structural defects , including the disorganization of the longitudinal SR ( 33 ) , disrupted thick filament assembly ( 34 ) and lateral alignment of myofibrils ( 35 ) , loss of dystrophin at costameres , and alterations in the arrangement of the subsarcolemmal microtubule lattice ( 36 ) . Therefore , this moderate reduction in obscurin expression in aged Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 atria could indicate a mild loss in the structural integrity of the myofibril , the cytoskeleton , and / or the SR membranes . Accordingly , obscurin expression levels are also reduced in human cardiac biopsies carrying DCM - linked point mutations in OBSCN ( E963K , V2161D , or D5966N ) ( 37 ) , substantiating that obscurin haploinsufficiency is pathogenic in the heart . FIGURE 5 Venn diagram depicting commonly deregulated proteins and phospho - proteins in Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 atria through aging . Of the 45 ( 6 - months ) and 48 ( 12 - months ) proteins that exhibited significantly deregulated expression in Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 atria , only 1 ( Cd151 ) was deregulated at both timepoints . In contrast , of the 27 ( 6 - months ) and 67 ( 12 - months ) deregulated phospho - proteins in Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 atria , a total of 8 ( Ttn , Cavin2 , Myl7 , Myoz2 , Nucks1 , Srrm1 , Synpo2l , and Sorbs1 ) were consistently deregulated through aging , albeit at different sites and / or affected in opposite directions at 6 - versus 12 - months ( Supplementary Tables S2 , S4 ) . Lastly , CaMKII δ exhibited deregulated expression at 6 - months and altered phosphorylation at 12 - months in Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 atria . Venn diagram generated with jvenn ( 84 ) .

In particular , the Ig58 / 59 deletion induced profound abnormalities in the expression and / or phosphorylation of intermediate filaments , sarcomeric proteins , Z - disk - associated and / or actin - linked cytoskeletal modulators , and structural components of the costamere . Intermediate filaments : Keratins At 12 - months , the expression levels of seven different keratin isoforms , including keratins 1 , 5 , 6A , 14 , 16 , 17 , and 42 , were significantly reduced in Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 atria ( Figure 4A ; Supplementary Table S3 ) . Although keratins have not been extensively studied in the heart , studies evaluating keratin 19 - deficient skeletal muscles show that they contribute to the organization of the costamere and the development of contractile force . Therefore , these findings indicate a drastic loss of intermediate filament proteins that are integral to the organization of costameres and force development in striated muscles ( 38 , 39 ) . Sarcomeric cytoskeleton : Titin , T - cap , MyBPC - 3 , and Myosin Light Chain 7 Our phospho - proteomic analysis revealed age - related alterations in the phosphorylation status of titin in Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 atria . In particular , we observed decreased levels of a bi - phosphorylated peptide , Ser34063 / Ser - Thr - Tyr 34062 - 34 , 080 , localizing to the titin M - band interdomain A B FIGURE 6 Ingenuity pathway analysis of the deregulated proteins and phospho - proteins in Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 atria at 6 - months .

The number of proteins associated with each biological process is indicated within the respective bar . Grogan et al . 10 . 3389 / fcvm . 2023 . 1085840 Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine 10 frontiersin . org sequence 2 ( Mis2 ) in Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 atria compared to wild - type at 6 - months ( Figure 3A’ ; Supplementary Table S2 ) . The physiological function ( s ) of these phosphorylation events are not yet known , however the titin Mis2 region has been previously established as a binding site for DRAL / FHL2 ( 40 ) . DRAL / FHL2 is a member of the four and a half LIM domain protein family that is thought to target metabolic enzymes to the M - band via binding to titin Mis2 ( 2 , 40 ) . Therefore , the deregulated phosphorylation of titin within Mis2 in Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 atria could potentially influence metabolic complexes that localize to the M - band . Along these lines , recent proteomic studies from our group and others conducted in heart or skeletal muscle where obscurin is either mutated ( 29 ) or deleted ( 41 ) have also reported alterations in proteins involved in metabolism , specifically lipid catabolism and amino acid metabolism ( 29 ) or glycogen metabolism ( 41 ) . Titin phosphorylation was also deregulated in Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 atria at 12 - months at three distinct locations : a bi - phosphorylated peptide corresponding to the Mis2 region of titin ( Ser33875 / Ser33880 ) , a site within the M - band ( Ser34470 ) , and a site within titin - Ig76 / 77 ( Ser9459 ; Figure 4A’ ; Supplementary Table S4 ) . Interestingly , the Ser34470 residue which exhibited enhanced phosphorylation resides within the third Lys - Ser - Pro ( KSP ) motif in titin - Mis4 . Of note , the KSP motifs have been shown to be highly phosphorylated during development in muscle and are thought to regulate the assembly of the M - band ( 42 ) . Thus , these findings are in line with the significantly increased atrial mass observed in Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 atria at 12 - months ( 10 ) in addition to our pathway analysis that indicated alterations in developmental processes such as cardiogenesis , striated muscle development , and the morphology of cardiomyocytes . A B FIGURE 7 Ingenuity pathway analysis of the deregulated proteins and phospho - proteins in Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 atria at 12 - months . ( A , B ) The molecular pathways ( A ) and cellular functions ( B ) associated with proteins that exhibited significantly altered expression or phosphorylation in 12 - month - old Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 atria . The number of proteins associated with each biological process is indicated within the respective bar . Grogan et al . 10 . 3389 / fcvm . 2023 . 1085840 Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine 11 frontiersin . org Telethonin , also known as Titin - cap or T - cap , is a Z - disk associated protein that binds to titin’s extreme NH 2 - terminal Ig1 / 2 domains where it is proposed to regulate sarcomeric development , stability , and stretch responses ( 43 , 44 ) . Our proteomic screen revealed reduced phosphorylation of T - cap at Ser161 in Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 atria at 12 - months ( Figure 4A’ ; Supplementary Table S4 ) . Candasamy et al . ( 44 ) previously reported that endogenous T - cap is constitutively bi - phosphorylated by both protein kinase D and CaMKII at Ser157 and Ser161 in rodent myocardia , and that disruption of these phosphorylation events results in disorganized t - tubule structures and abnormal Ca 2 + cycling . Given that the COOH - terminal region of T - cap containing Ser157 / Ser161 binds accessory proteins that localize to t - tubules , it has been further suggested that Ser157 / Ser161 phosphorylation may regulate T - cap’s ability to serve as an “adapter protein” linking t - tubules to the Z - disk ( 44 ) . An important observation is that the obscurin - Ig58 / 59 binding site on titin ( Ig9 / 10 ) exists in relative proximity to T - cap’s binding site to titin ( i . e . , titin - Ig1 / 2 ) . It is therefore conceivable that the Ig58 / 59 deletion could possibly disrupt the titin / T - cap complex at the Z - disk and / or influence the nearby regulatory networks that mediate Ser161 phosphorylation . Along these lines , the observed reduction of Ser161 phosphorylation in 12 - month Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 atria could possibly lead to disorganized t - tubule morphology , disrupted Ca 2 + - induced Ca 2 + - release , and potentially contribute to the development of arrhythmia . Lastly , we saw altered phosphorylation levels of proteins localizing to the thick filament in Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 atria through aging , including myosin light chain 7 and myosin binding protein - C ( MyBP - C ) . In particular , we observed a ~ 60 - fold decrease in the phosphorylation of Ser22 on myosin light chain 7 at 6 - months ( Figure 3A’ ; Supplementary Table S2 ) , which is the atrial myosin regulatory light chain isoform . The exact function of this phosphorylation event is not thoroughly characterized , though it was previously shown to be mediated by myosin light chain kinase in response to α - adrenergic signaling ( 45 ) . Moreover , phosphorylation of Ser23 on myosin light chain 7 , immediately adjacent to the phosphorylation site Ser22 that was deregulated in Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 atria at 6 - months , was significantly reduced at 12 - months ( Figure 4A’ ; Supplementary Table S4 ) . Furthermore , we also identified a novel phosphorylation event on cardiac MyBP - C , Ser268 , which exhibited a ~ 2 . 5 - fold reduction in phosphorylation in 12 - month old Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 atria ( Figure 4A’ ; Supplementary Table S4 ) . Importantly , this phosphorylation site localizes within the M - motif ( between Ig domains C1 and C2 ) , which is well established as a phosphorylation ‘hot - spot’ for cardiac MyBP - C . Previous studies have shown that reduced phosphorylation of cardiac MyBP - C within the M - motif is associated with the development of heart failure in mice and results in reduced rates of contraction and relaxation . It is therefore possible that reduced phosphorylation of Ser268 on cardiac MyBP - C and / or Ser23 on myosin light chain 7 could indicate deregulation of contractility in Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 atria at 12 - months . Actin - linked and / or Z - disk - associated cytoskeleton : Plectin , Cortactin , Myozenin , Synaptopodin 2 - l , LIM - domain - binding protein 3 , Myospryn Plectin , a cytoskeletal protein that forms physical links between actin , microtubules , and intermediate filaments , exhibited increased phosphorylation at Ser4415 in Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 atria at 12 - months ( Figure 4A’ ; Supplementary Table S4 ) . Additionally , cortactin , a scaffold protein that regulates the polymerization and stabilization of the actin cytoskeleton , exhibited decreased phosphorylation at a tri - phosphorylated peptide , Thr401 / Ser405 / Ser407 ( Figure 4A’ ; Supplementary Table S4 ) . Phosphorylation of the Thr401 / Ser405 residues on cortactin , mediated by Erk ( Ser405 ) ( 46 ) , Akt ( Thr401 / Ser405 ) ( 47 ) , and / or PKC δ ( Ser405 ) ( 48 ) , promotes actin polymerization and cell migration via enhancing the interaction between cortactin and actin nucleation promoting factors . Together , these results demonstrate alterations in the phosphorylation status of proteins regulating the assembly and organization of the actin cytoskeleton in 12 - month Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 atria . Our proteomic results indicated deregulated phosphorylation of three additional actin - associated proteins in Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 atria . In particular , phosphorylation of synaptopodin 2 - like , which is a member of the synaptopodin family of proteins that regulate actin polymerization at the Z - disk , was altered at Ser89 / Ser - Thr 83 - 126 and Thr88 / Ser97 at 6 - months and 12 - months , respectively ( Figures 3A’ , 4A’ ; Supplementary Tables S2 , S4 ) . Of note , Thr88 represents a novel phosphorylation event on synaptopodin 2 - like . In addition , LIM - domain - binding protein 3 , also known as Z - band alternatively spliced PDZ motif protein ( ZASP ) , displayed decreased phosphorylation at Thr119 / Ser123 in Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 atria at 6 - months ( Figure 3A’ ; Supplementary Table S2 ) . LIM - domain - binding protein 3 ( ZASP ) is a cytoskeletal protein that regulates Z - disk integrity and signal transduction through forming complexes with an array of Z - disk proteins , including α - actinin - 2 ( 49 , 50 ) , myozenin ( 51 , 52 ) , myotilins ( myotilin , myopalladin , and palladin ) ( 52 ) , and telethonin / Tcap ( 53 ) . Accordingly , the phosphorylation status of ZASP - interactive myozenin was also disrupted at phosphorylated peptides Ser95 / Ser116 and Thr111 / Ser116 / Ser - Thr - Tyr 92 - 132 at 6 - months , and Thr107 at 12 - months ( Figures 3A’ , 4A’ ; Supplementary Tables S2 , S4 ) . Together , these findings provide strong evidence that major cytoskeletal signaling complexes at the level of the Z - disk / thin filament are disrupted in Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 atria throughout aging . Dystrophin complex at the costamere : Dystrophin , Vinculin , Synemin Several proteins that serve as integral components of the dystrophin / dystroglycan complex and / or form structural links between the costamere and the cytoskeleton exhibited altered phosphorylation in Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 atria at 12 - months . In particular , synemin , an intermediate filament protein that mediates the lateral transmission of force and maintains the structural integrity of the myofibril during mechanical stress , exhibited increased phosphorylation at Ser1087 in Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 atria ( Figure 4A’ ; Supplementary Table S4 ) . Synemin is present at the level of the Z - disk where it interacts with α - actinin , desmin , vinculin , and components of the dystrophin glycoprotein complex ( 54 ) . Interestingly , vinculin , which links integrins to the actin cytoskeleton , exhibited increased phosphorylation at Ser721 in Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 atria at 12 - months ( Figure 4A’ ; Supplementary Table S4 ) . Furthermore , the abundance of a phospho - peptide corresponding to dystrophin , Ser - Thr 3624 - 3 , 664 , was decreased ( Figure 4A’ ; Supplementary Table S4 ) . Together , these results suggest phosphorylation defects in protein complexes that contribute to the formation of cytoskeletal links between the sarcomere and the extracellular matrix . Grogan et al . 10 . 3389 / fcvm . 2023 . 1085840 Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine 12 frontiersin . org Gap junctions : Connexin - 43 We also identified altered phosphorylation levels of connexin - 43 , the core protein that comprises gap junctions , in Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 atria at 12 - months . In particular , we saw increased phosphorylation of connexin - 43 at Ser325 / Thr326 , and decreased levels of the phospho - peptide , Ser - Thr 320 - 345 ( Figure 4A’ ; Supplementary Table S4 ) . Notably , the phosphorylation of Ser325 on connexin - 43 , along with nearby residues Ser328 and Ser330 , is mediated by casein kinase 1 and has been shown to stabilize the formation of gap junctions at the intercalated disc ( 55 ) . Thus , up - regulation of pSer325 on connexin - 43 could indicate enhanced gap junction formation in Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 atria at 12 - months and potentially impacting synchronous cardiomyocyte contraction therefore underlying arrhythmic events . In summary , our proteomic screen revealed extensive abnormalities in the expression and phosphorylation status of major structural regulators in aging Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 atria , including proteins that regulate the assembly and organization of the myofibril , form gap junctions , physically link the sarcomere to the surrounding membranes , and are integral components of the Z - disk associated cytoskeleton . Notably , obscurin and titin , two key cytoskeletal regulators , interact at the level of the Z - disk ( 8 ) . Given that the Z - disk is a region that integrates proteins of the sarcomere and the surrounding cellular structures , including the cytoskeleton , intercalated disc , and plasma membrane ( 56 ) , it is interesting to speculate that the disrupted binding between obscurin - Ig58 / 59 and titin could severely affect the stability and / or regulation of protein complexes that localize to this region . Moreover , many cytoskeletal proteins that localize to the Z - disk , particularly those forming connections to the extracellular matrix via costameres , aid in the transmission of force and mediate mechanical transduction pathways ( 56 ) . Therefore , our proteomics and phospho - proteomics findings could reflect pathological alterations in the stabilization of the myofibril during mechanical stress in Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 atria . Alterations in regulatory proteins and signaling mediators in aging Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 atria Our proteomic and phospho - proteomic analysis also revealed alterations in the expression and phosphorylation of regulatory proteins and signaling mediators in aging Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 atria . Specifically , we observed alterations in canonical regulators of Ca 2 + cycling and major protein kinases that could potentially contribute to the development of atrial fibrillation in Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 mice . Calcium cycling proteins : SERCA2 , SERCA3 , RyR2 , HRC Our phospho - proteomic screen and subsequent enrichment analysis identified several differentially phosphorylated Ca 2 + cycling regulators in Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 atria at 6 - and 12 - months . At 6 - months , we identified a novel phosphorylation site localized within the hydrolase domain of SERCA3 , Ser729 , which was significantly reduced in Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 atria ( Figure 3A’ ; Supplementary Table S2 ) . SERCA3 was originally thought to be exclusively expressed in non - muscle tissues , however , SERCA3 isoforms were ultimately detected in normal human LV tissue as well ( 57 ) . Notably , a significant distinction between SERCA3 and the more abundantly expressed SERCA2a isoform is that SERCA3 is unable to bind PLN ( 58 ) . Given that loss of binding between Ig58 / 59 and PLN in Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 atria could lead to enhanced inhibition of SERCA2 ( via loss of Ig58 / 59 - mediated sequestration of PLN ) , it is possible that the decreased phosphorylation of SERCA3 at Ser729 at 6 - months could serve as a compensatory response . Moreover , at 12 - months , we observed a significant reduction in the levels of the SERCA2 phospho - peptide , Ser - Thr - Tyr 372 - 397 , demonstrating potential abnormalities in Ca 2 + reuptake into the SR through aging ( Figure 4A’ ; Supplementary Table S4 ) . Histidine rich Ca 2 + binding protein ( HRC ) , a protein that localizes to the SR lumen where it regulates Ca 2 + storage and release ( 59 ) , exhibited reduced phosphorylation at Ser272 in Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 atria at 12 - months ( Figure 4A’ ; Supplementary Table S4 ) . Although this phosphorylation site has not been experimentally characterized , previous studies have suggested that phosphorylation of HRC by casein kinase II regulates RyR2 function in skeletal muscle ( 59 , 60 ) . Importantly , we also observed up - regulation of phosphorylated Ser2810 ( Ser2811 in humans ) on RyR2 in Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 atria at 12 - months ( Figure 4A’ ; Supplementary Table S4 ) . Hyper - phosphorylation of RyR2 , specifically at the canonical Ser2808 and Ser2814 sites ( human notation ) , has been strongly linked to enhanced RyR2 open probability and susceptibility to arrhythmia ( 25 , 26 ) . Although there is still controversy regarding the roles of individual RyR2 phosphorylation sites and their potential functional redundancies , it is generally accepted that the “phosphorylation hot - spot” in RyR2 encompassing human Ser2808 through Ser2814 ( 26 ) is an effective modulator of Ca 2 + release from the SR . In addition to the Ser2808 and Ser2814 sites which are regulated by CaMKII and / or PKA , there are two additional sites within the hot - spot , Thr2810 and Ser2811 , for which less information is known , although both are predicted to impact RyR2 function similarly to Ser2808 and Ser2814 ( 26 , 27 ) . Therefore , hyper - phosphorylation of RyR2 at Ser2810 ( human Ser2811 ) combined with altered HRC phosphorylation in Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 atria could potentially lead to abnormal Ca 2 + release and / or Ca 2 + leak from the SR in Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 atria at 12 - months . Kinases : CaMKII δ , SPEG , MAPKs , myosin light chain kinase 3 In addition to proteins directly regulating Ca 2 + homeostasis , we also identified alterations in the expression and phosphorylation of several kinases in our proteomic screen including Ca 2 + / calmodulin - dependent protein kinase δ ( CaMKII δ ) and striated muscle preferentially expressed gene ( SPEG ) . CaMKII δ is one of the major protein kinases that regulates Ca 2 + dynamics in the heart via phosphorylation of Ca 2 + handling proteins in response to physiological and / or pathological stimuli ( 61 , 62 ) . Importantly , the expression level of CaMKII δ was ~ 2 . 5 fold lower in Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 atria compared to wild - type at 6 - months ( Figure 3A ; Supplementary Table S1 ) . At 12 - months , CaMKII δ abundance was no longer altered , but its phosphorylation was increased at both Thr331 and another site within the Ser - Thr 323 - 344 region ( Figure 4A’ ; Supplementary Table S4 ) . The physiological significance of pThr331 has not yet been experimentally determined . However , the deregulation of CaMKII δ in aged Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 male atria along with its preeminent role in cardiac hypertrophy makes it a key target for future investigation . Our phospho - proteomic analysis also identified a novel phosphorylation site , Ser2200 , that localizes to the inter - kinase Grogan et al . 10 . 3389 / fcvm . 2023 . 1085840 Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine 13 frontiersin . org region of SPEG , a paralog of obscurin that arose from gene duplication of OBSCN , that was significantly decreased in Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 atria at 12 - months ( Figure 4A’ ; Supplementary Table S4 ) . SPEG , sharing high homology to obscurin , also possesses two tandem kinase domains at its COOH - terminus ( termed SK1 and SK2 , highly homologous to obscurin Kin1 and Kin2 ) that have been implicated in the regulation of Ca 2 + homeostasis ( 63 ) . In addition to Ser2200 , SPEG also exhibited decreased phosphorylation at Ser2182 , which is located within the same inter - kinase region ( Figure 4A’ ; Supplementary Table S4 ) . The functions of these phosphorylation events are not known , but they could potentially affect the substrate specificities and / or activities of SPEG SK1 , which phosphorylates junctophilin 2 , and / or SPEG SK2 , that phosphorylates SERCA2 and possibly RyR2 ( 63 ) . Additionally , phosphorylation of myosin light chain kinase 3 was decreased at Ser155 in Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 atria at 12 - months ( Figure 4A’ ; Supplementary Table S4 ) . Although the function of this site is not precisely known , this finding could corroborate the reduction in phosphorylation of its substrate , myosin regulatory light chain 7 , that we also observed in Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 atria ( Figure 4A’ ; Supplementary Table S4 ) . Lastly , we observed altered phosphorylation levels of mitogen - activated protein kinase 1 ( MAPK1 ) and 14 ( MAPK14 ) at Thr183 / Thr188 ( up - regulated ) and Thr185 ( down - regulated ) , respectively ( Figure 4A’ ; Supplementary Table S4 ) . MAPKs are a family of highly conserved signaling mediators that regulate a diverse set of cellular processes such as proliferation , cell death / survival , transcription , migration , and differentiation by phosphorylating hundreds of downstream targets . In the heart , MAPK1 and MAPK14 isoforms regulate cardiac development and differentiation and promote the hypertrophic response ( 64 ) . Importantly , Thr183 / Thr188 and Thr185 reside within the regulatory loop of MAPK1 and MAPK14 . In fact , Thr183 in MAPK1 is part of the canonical Thr - Glu - Tyr motif , which is phosphorylated by the upstream kinase , MEK1 / 2 ( 65 , 66 ) . Lastly , tyrosine hydroxylase , the rate limiting enzyme involved in the synthesis of catecholamines such as epinephrine and norepinephrine , exhibited reduced phosphorylation at Thr30 in Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 atria at 12 - months ( Figure 4A’ ; Supplementary Table S4 ) . While not a kinase itself , alteration of tyrosine hydroxylase could impact adrenergic activity and / or downstream PKA signaling in Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 atria . Conclusion Collectively , our proteomics and phospho - proteomics data demonstrated extensive alterations in the expression and phosphorylation status of proteins involved in diverse cellular processes , including major Ca 2 + cycling regulators , protein kinases , and cytoskeletal protein complexes associated with the Z - disk that likely drive atrial structural remodeling and arrhythmogenesis in Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 male mice . It is interesting to note the lack of proteins that consistently exhibit altered expression in Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 atria at both timepoints ( Figure 5 ) . In contrast , multiple phospho - proteins are affected throughout aging in Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 atria including titin ( Ttn ) , caveolae associated protein 2 ( Cavin2 ) , myosin light chain 7 ( Myl7 ) , myozenin 2 ( Myoz2 ) , nuclear casein kinase and cyclin - dependent kinase substrate 1 ( Nucks1 ) , sorbin and SH3 domain containing 1 ( Sorbs1 ) , serine / arginine repetitive matrix 1 ( Srrm1 ) , and synaptopodin 2 - like ( Synpo2l ; Figure 5 ) . Notably , several of these proteins ( i . e . , titin , myosin light chain 7 , myozenin , and synaptopodin 2 - like ) also constitute core components of the phospho - proteomic STRING networks at both timepoints , comprising 4 / 6 of the functionally and / or physically interconnected phospho - proteins at 6 - months or contribute to a much larger network composed of 23 interconnected phospho - proteins at 12 - months . Together , these observations suggest that these commonly deregulated phospho - proteins could represent key players in disease development due to deletion of obscurin - Ig58 / 59 , and that disrupted phosphorylation events could largely contribute to the progressive pathologies that manifest through aging . Along these lines , our proteomics analysis revealed alterations in the expression and / or phosphorylation status of major protein kinases in aging Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 atria , including CaMKII δ and MAPK1 and 14 . To corroborate our proteomics findings and underscore the contribution of deregulated phosphorylation to the Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 disease phenotype , we performed immunoblots evaluating the expression and phosphorylation levels of two major deregulated kinases in Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 atria that are amenable to validation due to the availability of relevant ( phospho ) - antibodies . In contrast to our proteomics results ( Figure 3A ; Supplementary Table S1 ) , we were not able to confirm decreased expression of CaMKII δ in Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 atria at 6 - months via immunoblot analysis ( Figures 8A , A’ ) , possibly reflecting the reduced sensitivity of immunoblotting techniques compared to proteomics , or a potential artifact in our proteomics data . We next evaluated the phosphorylation levels of MAPK1 ( also known as ERK2 ) at pThr183 / pTyr185 , given that our phospho - proteomic screen revealed a 2 . 35 - fold increase in the levels of the bi - phosphorylated peptide , Thr183 / Thr188 , in Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 atria at 12 - months ( Figure 4A’ ; Supplementary Table S4 ) . Consistent with our proteomics results , our immunoblotting analysis revealed a 2 . 89 - fold increase in the phosphorylation of the canonical activation motif , pThr183 / pTyr185 ( Figures 8B , B’ ) , demonstrating up - regulated MAPK1 activity in 12 - month Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 atria . Given the established role of MAPK1 in the hypertrophic response and atrial fibrillation ( 64 , 67 – 69 ) , this may contribute to the development of progressive remodeling and / or arrhythmogenesis in aging Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 atria . In addition to potential hypertrophic remodeling mediated by MAPKs , the abundance of deregulated cytoskeletal proteins in Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 atria ( particularly those localizing to the Z - disk ) suggests abnormalities in the organization of sarcomeres and the cellular structures that form connections to the Z - disk ( i . e . , t - tubules , the intercalated disc , costameres ) . In particular , the dramatic reduction in keratin protein levels , and decreased phosphorylation of residues with defined ( patho ) physiological functions such as T - cap ( Ser161 ) , cortactin ( Thr401 / Ser405 / Ser407 ) , and connexin - 43 ( Ser325 ) , implicate disrupted cytoskeletal structures , t - tubules , and intercalated discs in Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 atria at 12 - months . Interestingly , we did not observe any major defects in myofibril or sarcomeric ultrastructure in our evaluation of Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 left ventricles ( 10 ) , suggesting potential distinctions in the cellular and molecular pathogenesis of the Ig58 / 59 deletion between cardiac chambers . Along these lines , neither our immunoblotting nor our proteomics analysis revealed reduced phosphorylation of PLN ( Thr17 ) or RyR2 ( Ser2814 ) in aging Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 atria , which were both significantly decreased in Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 left ventricles ( 10 ) . In contrast , RyR2 was hyperphosphorylated at a distinct site , Ser2810 Grogan et al . 10 . 3389 / fcvm . 2023 . 1085840 Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine 14 frontiersin . org ( human Ser2811 ) , in Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 atria at 12 - months . Our future studies will more closely interrogate the cellular impacts of the Ig58 / 59 deletion specifically in atrial tissues to determine how chamber - specific molecular alterations caused by the Ig58 / 59 deletion affect atrial structure and function . Our physiological evaluations of the Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 model revealed the presence of severe arrhythmia characterized by episodes of junctional escape and the sporadic loss of regular p - waves reminiscent of atrial fibrillation ( 10 ) . Atrial fibrillation represents the most common type of sustained arrhythmia in humans and its prevalence increases substantially with aging ( 70 , 71 ) . The entire complex of structural , architectural , contractile , and electrophysiological alterations occurring in diseased atrial myocardium has recently established “atrial cardiomyopathy” as a new disease entity ( 72 ) . Previous proteomic efforts aiming to characterize the molecular changes underlying atrial fibrillation and / or atrial cardiomyopathy in animals ( 73 , 74 ) and humans ( 75 – 82 ) have similarly reported alterations in structural and metabolic proteins , ion channels and Ca 2 + regulators ( 82 ) . However comprehensive phospho - proteomic analyses remain scarce , although they are integral to deciphering the role of phosphorylation in the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation ( 83 ) . Nonetheless , the discovery of novel and / or uncharacterized phosphorylation events via phospho - proteomic screens must be further validated in situ and in vivo and investigated in terms of pathophysiological and functional relevance . In summary , to our knowledge , the present study is the first to evaluate the atrial phospho - proteome through aging using a genetic model of spontaneous atrial arrhythmia and remodeling . Given the presence of both structural and regulatory proteins exhibiting deregulated expression and / or phosphorylation in aging Obscn - Δ Ig58 / 59 atria ( including many phosphorylation events with unknown functions ) , our present findings reveal numerous molecular targets associated with novel and / or uncharacterized pathways to be interrogated in future studies and provides new mechanistic insights into atrial remodeling and dysfunction .
