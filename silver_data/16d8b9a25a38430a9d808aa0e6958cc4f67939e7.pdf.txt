One of these adaptor pro - teins , huntingtin interacting protein 1 ( HIP1 ) , induces cellu - lar transformation and is overexpressed in some prostate cancers . We have discovered that HIP1 associates with the androgen receptor through a central coiled coil domain and is recruited to DNA response elements upon androgen stimulation . HIP1 is a novel androgen receptor regulator , I signiﬁcantly repressing transcription when knocked down using a silencing RNA approach and activating tran - scription when overexpressed . We have also identiﬁed a functional nuclear localization signal at the COOH termi - nus of HIP1 , which contributes to the nuclear transloca - tion of the protein . In conclusion , we have discovered that HIP1 is a nucleocytoplasmic protein capable of associat - ing with membranes and DNA response elements and regulating transcription . Introduction Endocytosis is important for receptor internalization , nutrient uptake , antigen presentation , pathogen internalization , and maintenance of plasma membrane surface area . Endocytosis occurs via several distinct pathways and requires coordinated interactions between a variety of molecules at the membrane and cell cortex . In yeast , a functional connection between the actin cytoskeleton and endocytosis has been firmly established ( Geli and Riezman , 1998 ) . Mutations in actin and in several actin - binding proteins inhibit both receptor - mediated and fluid - phase endocytosis ( Kubler and Riezman , 1993 ; Munn et al . , 1995 ) . To gain insights into the roles of actin in endocytosis , it was important to identify actin - binding proteins with a func - tional involvement in endocytosis . Sla2p was one of the first to be identified in a synthetic lethal screen in yeast against a null allele of ABP1 , a gene encoding an actin - binding protein impli - cated in cytoskeletal regulation , endocytosis , and cAMP sig - naling . Sla2p is a peripheral membrane protein that contains a novel NH 2 - terminal domain , three putative coiled coil domains , a putative leucine zipper , and a COOH - terminal talin - like domain ( Holtzman et al . , 1993 ; Wesp et al . , 1997 ) . Sla2p binds to F - actin in vitro through the talin - like domain and partially colocalizes with F - actin in cortical patches ( McCann and Craig , 1997 ; Yang et al . , 1999 ) . Homologues of Sla2p have since been identified in nem - atodes ( ZK370 . 3 ) and humans ( HIP1 and HIP1R ) . Huntingtin interacting protein 1 ( HIP1 ) is predominantly expressed in brain and was first identified in a yeast two - hybrid screen for interacting partners of huntingtin ( Kalchman et al . , 1997 ; Wanker et al . , 1997 ) . Huntington’s disease is an inherited neu - rodegenerative disorder caused by expansion of the codon CAG in the huntingtin gene , which leads to expression of a polyglutamine tract in the protein ( Reddy et al . , 1999 ) . The af - finity of the huntingtin protein – HIP1 interaction is inversely correlated to the polyglutamine repeat length ( Kalchman et al . , 1997 ) . HIP1 is a 116 - kD AP180 NH 2 - terminal homology ( ANTH ) domain – containing protein capable of binding to phosphatidylinositol lipids and recruiting clathrin via a short peptide motif of the LLMDMD type in the vicinity of a central coiled coil domain ( Mishra et al . , 2001 ; Hyun et al . , 2004 ) . Consequently , much of the functional work on the HIP1 fam - ily has focused on its ability to modulate actin dynamics in clathrin - mediated endocytosis . However , HIP1 was recently found to be overexpressed in a subset of cancers of the prostate and colorectum ( Rao et al . , 2002 ) . Prostate cancer is a disease , which in its advanced form is associated with changes in the transcriptional response and expression of a polyglutamine repeat – containing transcription I . G .

The AR is a member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily of transcription factors . The AR consists of an NH 2 - terminal do - main containing polyglutamine and polyglycine repeats , which interacts with a series of transcriptional coregulators ; a zinc finger DNA - binding domain ; a hinge region encompassing nu - clear localization signals ; an acetylation site ; and a COOH - ter - minal ligand - binding domain . The nuclear translocation of this transcription factor is dependent on the binding of androgen by the COOH - terminal ligand - binding domain . An actin - binding protein , filamin , was recently shown to interact with the recep - tor and to be required for translocation ( Ozanne et al . , 2000 ) . A subset of endocytic adaptor proteins including Eps15 and Epsin1 have been reported to undergo nucleocytoplasmic shuttling on the basis that their steady - state distribution be - comes nuclear upon treating cells with an antifungal antibiotic , Leptomycin B , which inhibits nuclear export ( Hyman et al . , 2000 ; Vecchi et al . , 2001 ) . A strong argument against a nuclear distribution of these proteins is the absence of a nuclear sub - fraction under untreated conditions , although this can be ex - plained by a high rate of nuclear export . A potential nuclear function for Eps15 and CALM was reported to be the regula - tion of transcription on the basis of their modulatory effects us - ing a GAL4 - based transactivation assay ( Vecchi et al . , 2001 ) . In this study , we have examined the effects of androgen treatment on the subcellular distribution of HIP1 and the ef - fects of this protein on AR - mediated transcription . We have uncovered a functional association of HIP1 with androgen re - sponse elements ( AREs ) , providing the first direct evidence for transcriptional modulation of hormone - responsive genes by an endocytic adaptor . Results HIP1 is both nuclear and cytosolic A characteristic of prostatic tissue is a transcriptional response to androgen , which is mediated by the AR . We used an AR expressing prostate cancer cell line LNCaP to examine by subcellular fractionation changes in the distribution of the en - dogenous AR and HIP1 in response to treatment with a synthetic androgen , Mibolerone . Treating LNCaP cells with Mibolerone resulted in a 70 % increase in nuclear AR but also resulted in a nuclear redistribution of HIP1 of up to 50 % ( Fig . 1 C ) . In con - trast , clathrin , a binding partner of HIP1 , remained entirely cytosolic ( Fig . 1 A ) . This nuclear translocation was observed using confocal microscopy after Mibolerone treatment ( Fig . 1 B ) . Translocation of endogenous AR and HIP1 was also induced by treating LNCaP cells with the physiological androgen dihy - drotestosterone ( unpublished data ) . HIP1 associates with the AR HIP1 was first identified as an interacting partner of a poly - glutamine repeat – containing protein , huntingtin , in a yeast two - hybrid screen with a binding affinity inversely proportional to the size of the polyglutamine tract ( Wanker et al . , 1997 ) . We tested whether HIP1 also interacts with the AR , also a poly - glutamine repeat – containing protein , using immunoprecipitation . Endogenous AR and HIP1 were coimmunoprecipitated from the LNCaP cell line ( Fig . 2 A ) . This has been confirmed inde - pendently by band identification using mass spectroscopy ( un - published data ) . We have also confirmed this interaction using transfected COS7 cells in a mammalian two - hybrid screen with the AR coactivator Tip60 as a positive control ( Brady et al . , 1999 ; unpublished data ) . We used a GAL4 - based transactivation assay in an at - tempt to identify domains of HIP1 with potential nuclear functions ( Fig . 2 B ) . Expression constructs encoding the GAL4 DNA - binding domain fused to full - length HIP1 , a con - struct bearing the FxDxF / coiled coil and I / LWEQ domains ( (cid:1) ANTH ) , and a construct consisting of the COOH - terminal I / LWEQ domain alone were cotransfected along with a reporter plasmid encoding the luciferase gene under the transcriptional control of a GAL4 - responsive promoter into AR - null COS7 cells . GAL4 - HIP1 and GAL4 - (cid:1) ANTH produced a three - to fourfold transactivation over the basal value produced by GAL4 alone ( Fig . 2 B ) . Although the degree of transactivation was lower than that produced by E2F1 , an established trans - Figure 1 . HIP1 is found in a nuclear subcellular fraction .

Nuclear ( N ) and cytosolic ( C ) fractions were resolved by SDS - PAGE ( 50 (cid:2) g per lane ) , trans - ferred to nitrocellulose , and blotted for the AR , HIP1 , lamin B , and clathrin , illustrated here with representative blots .

We attempted to narrow down the binding site for the AR in HIP1 by expressing and purifying GST - tagged domain con - structs of HIP1 encompassing the coiled coil domain , the coiled coil / DxF region , and the COOH - terminal I / LWEQ do - main from Escherichia coli . We then incubated these recombi - nant domains with lysate extracted from COS7 cells trans - fected with the AR and , after immunoprecipitation with a polyclonal AR antibody , blotted for the AR , GST , and HIP1 . Equal quantities of the AR were immunoprecipitated in the conditions used . A HIP1 blot detected an association with the FxDxF / coiled coil domain and this was confirmed using an antibody raised against GST ( Fig . 2 C ) . From these data we conclude that HIP1 and the AR associate , and that this associa - tion requires the central FxDxF / coiled coil domain of HIP1 . HIP1 is a transcriptional regulator of hormone receptors We investigated the effects of ectopic HIP1 expression on the transcriptional activity of the AR using a luciferase reporter construct driven by a prostate - specific antigen ( PSA ) promoter , pPSALuc . COS7 cells were cotransfected with the AR and in - creasing quantities of HIP1 . The transcriptional response to an - drogen stimulation was enhanced in a dose - dependent manner with a maximal fourfold enhancement above the stimulatory level achieved in the absence of HIP1 ( Fig . 3 A ) . Coactivation was selectively blocked with an anti - androgen , bicalutamide ( Ca - sodex ; Fig . 3 A ) . HIP1 - dependent coactivation is therefore un - likely to be a cross talk effect occurring through AR - independent Figure 2 . Association between HIP1 and the AR . ( A ) LNCaP cells were transiently transfected with 2 (cid:2) g pcDNA3 - AR and pcDNA3 - Myc - HIP1 per 90 - mm dish . Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti - AR anti - body and immunoblotted with an anti - AR polyclonal antibody and an anti - HIP1 mAb . ( B ) HIP1 acts as a transcriptional regulator in GAL4 - based assays . COS - 7 cells were cotransfected with a GAL4 - regulated luciferase reporter construct , and chimeric constructs encompassing the GAL4 DNA - binding domain fused to HIP1 and the following domains : ANTH ( encom - passing aa 1 – 310 ) , (cid:1) ANTH ( encompassing aa 320 – 1037 ) , and I / LWEQ ( encompassing aa 800 – 1037 ) . Luciferase activity was measured 48 h af - ter transfection on equal amounts of total cellular lysates that expressed comparable levels of the various GAL4 fusion proteins as assessed by anti - GAL4 immunoblot ( inset ) . Graphed data represent the means of three in - dependent experiments with error bars for the SD . ( C ) COS7 cells were transfected with 2 (cid:2) g pcDNA3 - AR per 9 - cm dish . Lysates were prepared and the AR was immunoprecipitated from 300 (cid:2) g of lysate supplemented with 10 (cid:2) g of recombinant proteins . The left panel is a Coomassie - stained gel illustrating the equivalent loading of GST ( lane 1 ) , GST - ANTH domain ( lane 2 ) , GST - FxDxF / coiled coil domain encompassing aa 320 – 800 ( lane 3 ) , and GST - I / LWEQ domain ( lane 4 ) . Immunoprecipitates were blotted for AR , HIP1 , and GST as indicated . Figure 3 . HIP1 is a transcriptional coregulator for the AR .

Cells were treated with10 nM Mibolerone (cid:3) 1 (cid:2) M bicalutamide ( Casodex ) for 48 h and luciferase activ - ity was normalized for transfection efficiency as determined by (cid:4) - galac - tosidase assays and expressed relative to vehicle - treated singly transfected AR - positive cells .

After 48 h , cells were lysed and luciferase assays were performed as described .

Coactivation was also observed when a minimal ARE reporter construct was used , further arguing against surrogate effects on the activities of other transcription factors ( Fig . 3 B ) . To determine whether the effects on AR - mediated tran - scription reflected an association between HIP1 and AREs , or were less direct , chromatin immunoprecipitations ( ChIP ) were undertaken using antibodies against HIP1 and the AR . Se - quences corresponding to the proximal ( AREI ) and distal ( AREIII ) AREs were amplified by PCR ( Fig . 4 A ) . ChIP as - says were performed over 4 h after treatment of LNCaP cells with Mibolerone . A temporal recruitment of HIP1 and the AR to both AREI and AREIII was observed , though the temporal recruitment of HIP1 differed somewhat from that of the AR ( Fig . 4 B ) . HIP1 was recruited within 1 h of Mibolerone treat - ment to AREI at levels that were sustained over the 4 - h treat - ment period in contrast to the biphasic recruitment of the AR , which peaked at 1 and 4 h maxima . Recruitment of the AR to AREIII was also biphasic , resembling the pattern of recruit - ment to AREI ( Fig . 4 B ) . In contrast , the recruitment of HIP1 to AREIII was monophasic with maximal recruitment detectable 1 h after stimulation with Mibolerone . In a reChIP assay , im - munoprecipitated chromatin extracts were blotted for HIP1 and the AR after 2 h of treatment with Mibolerone . HIP1 and the AR were reciprocally immunoprecipitated and associated with AREI but not with a non - ARE – containing region of the PSA promoter ( AREX ; Fig . 4 C ) . Synchronous AR binding is not a requisite for the associa - tion of HIP1 with AREs , and HIP1 may therefore potentially as - sociate with other promoters / response elements and regulate the transcriptional activity of other nuclear hormone nuclear recep - tors . Indeed , cotransfection of HIP1 with (cid:5) and (cid:4) isoforms of the estrogen receptor enhanced their transcriptional response to estradiol treatment . The coactivation effect of HIP1 was appre - ciably greater than that of one of the best - characterized estrogen receptor coactivators , p300 ( Fig . S1 , A and B , available at http : / / www . jcb . org / cgi / content / full / jcb . 200503106 / DC1 ; Hanstein et al . , 1996 ) . Furthermore , increasing quantities of HIP1 cotrans - fected into COS - 7 cells along with the glucocorticoid receptor produced progressive transcriptional coactivation of this recep - tor ( Fig . S1 C ) . Interestingly , when HIP1 is cotransfected into COS7 cells along with a fusion of GAL4 with the ligand - bind - ing domain ( GAL4 - LBD ) of the glucocorticoid receptor , no ad - ditional transcriptional enhancement is observed ( Fig . S1 D ) . This implies that the effects of HIP1 on other nuclear hormone receptors may depend on the NH 2 - terminal domains of these proteins . HIP1 therefore affects the transcriptional activity of other members of the nuclear hormone receptor family and this is characteristic of many AR coregulators . HIP1 levels affect the rate of AR degradation We examined whether endogenous HIP1 was also required to sustain AR transcriptional activity by taking a silencing RNA ( siRNA ) approach to knockdown HIP1 in LNCaP cells ( Fig . 5 A ) . HIP1 levels were reduced by 70 – 80 % using this ap - proach , as were levels of PSA , an androgen - responsive gene product for which AR activity is required . Protein levels of the AR were also reduced and quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR for HIP1 , HIP1R , AR , and PSA was used to determine whether the reduction in the protein levels was reflected at the mRNA level . HIP1 mRNA was significantly reduced as pre - dicted from the siRNA targeting of this protein , as were the mRNA levels of PSA , which reflects both the decreased level of AR in the treated cells and perhaps reduced transcriptional activity although it was not possible to differentiate between these two factors ( Fig . 5 B ) . Strikingly , the mRNA levels of the AR itself were unaffected , and this implied that the reduction in the protein levels of the AR reflected an effect on protein rather than mRNA turnover . We explored this further by repeating the siRNA experiment and at 36 h after treatment inhibiting new protein synthesis by treating the cells with cycloheximide . Ly - sates were then prepared at two hourly time points after the ap - plication of the cycloheximide block and blotted for the AR , HIP1 , and (cid:4) - tubulin . The half - life of the AR was found to be reduced threefold in cells treated with siRNA - targeting HIP1 versus control siRNA ( Fig . 5 C ) . HIP1 therefore reduces the rate of AR degradation . It is not currently known what the mechanism for AR degradation may be . There is evidence that the AR is ubiquitinated and that this enhances its transcrip - tional activity , whereas treatment with proteasomal inhibitors reduces the rate of AR dissociation from the AREs and AR - mediated transcription ( Beitel et al . , 2002 ; Burgdorf et al . , 2004 ) . However , treatment of cells with MG132 , a proteasomal inhibitor , has not been shown to increase the protein levels of Figure 4 . HIP1 associates with ARE .

( B ) ChIP was performed in LNCaP cells using both HIP1 and AR antibodies over a 4 - h androgen time course . PCR was performed for AREs I and III . ( C ) ReChIP assays were performed in LNCaP cells by reprobing AR immunocomplexes with AR and HIP1 antibodies after 2 - h androgen treatment . AR - HIP1 association was analyzed at ARE I and a non - ARE – containing portion of the PSA promoter ( AREX ) . on A ugu s t 29 , 2008 www . j c b . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m Published July 18 , 2005 HIP1 IS A NOVEL TRANSCRIPTIONAL COREGULATOR • MILLS ET AL . 195 the AR appreciably and so a direct link between AR ubiquitina - tion and AR degradation is yet to be made ( Tanner et al . , 2004 ) . Transcriptional regulation by HIP1 is distinct from lipid binding and requires a COOH - terminal NLS HIP1 has in the past been reported to play a role as an adaptor in clathrin - dependent membrane trafficking of growth factor recep - tors through the binding of phosphoinositides and clathrin ( Hyun et al . , 2004 ) . It was therefore important to dissect the transcriptional effects of HIP1 from its other established func - tions . To do this , mutations were made in the phosphoinositide - binding ANTH domain of HIP1 based on the strong homology with other ANTH domain – containing proteins ( Fig . 6 A ) . The crystal structure of the ANTH domain of clathrin assembly lym - phoid myeloid leukemia protein ( CALM ) in complex with a sol - uble short - chain ( diC 8 ) L - (cid:5) - D - myo - phosphatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate has been resolved and the strong homology with HIP1 therefore enabled us to identify conserved basic residues predicted to lie in the lipid binding pocket ( Ford et al . , 2001 ) . Two conserved lysine residues were mutated ( K56E / K58E ) and the effects of these HIP1 mutations were tested using bacterially expressed wild - type and mutant HIP1 ANTH domains ( HIP1N ; amino acids 1 – 310 ) in a liposome sedimentation assay . Mutation of the equivalent conserved residues in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Sla2p ( Lysines - 24 and - 26 to alanine ) result in the complete ab - lation of lipid binding ( Sun et al . , 2005 ) . In our study , neither the wild - type nor the mutant construct bound efficiently to control Figure 5 . Silencing HIP1 expression reduces the transcriptional activity and protein levels of the AR .

However , the double lysine mutation knocked out lipid binding as predicted . To determine whether the K56E / K58E mutation affected the subcellular distribution of HIP1 , LNCaP cells were trans - fected with Myc - His HIP1 or the HIP1 K56 / K58E double mu - tant . Enriched clathrin - coated vesicle fractions were prepared and blotted for clathrin , HIP1 , and adaptors . The double mutant of HIP1 was significantly de - enriched from the CCV fraction relative to the wild - type protein ( Fig . 6 C ) . The lipid binding mutation may therefore increase the size of the “free” or cyto - solic pool of HIP1 available to associate with the AR and / or al - ternative scaffolds such as DNA response elements and tran - scription complexes . The COOH - terminal I / LWEQ domain has regularly spaced , conserved amino acids believed to comprise four (cid:5) - helices , and in Sla2p and HIP1R this domain binds to F - actin ( Engqvist - Goldstein et al . , 1999 ; Legendre - Guillemin et al . , 2002 ) . Mutation of a conserved residue , arginine - 958 , in Sla2p ablates actin binding ( McCann and Craig , 1999 ) . Although by sequence alignment this arginine residue ( R1005 ) is also present in HIP1 , there is only limited biochemical evidence for an asso - ciation between a recombinantly expressed I / LWEQ domain fragment and actin ( Senetar et al . , 2004 ) . Indeed binding is ab - sent if a larger expression construct incorporating an upstream (cid:5) - helix ( USH ) is used in the same binding assay . Other groups have also been unable to detect actin binding with expression constructs encompassing the entire talin - like ( I / LWEQ ) do - main ( Legendre - Guillemin et al . , 2002 ) . Given this ambiguity and in light of the nuclear role that we have uncovered for HIP1 , we undertook algorithmic searches for other motifs within this COOH - terminal do - main . We identified a putative NLS at the COOH terminus be - tween amino acids 996 and 1009 resembling the consensus RK ] x [ RK ] x [ KR ] x [ 4 – 6 ] RKK , which is strikingly absent in other proteins with talin - like domains ( Fig . 6 A ; Cokol et al . , 2000 ) . This implied an alternative role for R1005 in nuclear transport . We therefore mutated this residue to a glutamate and tagged GFP expression vectors with the HIP1 NLS , the mu - tated NLS , and the equivalent sequence region in HIP1R . Con - focal imaging revealed that the GFP - HIP1 construct has an in - complete but clear nuclear colocalization in comparison to GFP - HIP1R ( Fig 7 , A and B ) . Subcellular fractionation re - vealed that this amounted to an approximate doubling in the amount of nuclear GFP when compared with GFP - HIP1R , the R1005E mutant , or GFP alone ( Fig . 7 , C and D ) . This indicates that an NLS within HIP1 itself can contribute to nuclear import and predicts an interaction between HIP1 and importins . A large number of imported proteins contain multiple or bipartite NLS motifs , which cumulatively result in high efficiency of import . Given the fact that the AR contains NLS motifs in its hinge region , we cannot rule out the possibility that other NLS - containing proteins may translocate into the nucleus in a com - plex with HIP1 . This would explain why , in COS7 cells cotransfected with HIP1 and the AR , the nuclear translocation of both is androgen - reponsive and more efficient than that of the GFP - tagged minimal NLS ( Georget et al . , 2002 ; Saporita et al . , 2003 ) . On the basis of this preliminary characterization of the HIP1 mutants , we predicted that the lipid binding mutant ( K56E / K58E ) might enhance the ability of HIP1 to coactivate the AR by increasing the available cytosolic pool of HIP1 for nuclear import . We also hypothesized that reducing nuclear import with the R1005E mutation might conversely reduce the transcrip - tional activity of the AR by having a dominant negative effect on the nuclear import of both HIP1 and , owing to their association , the AR . To test this , we transfected mutant and wild - type HIP1 into COS7 cells and examined the Mibolerone response of the pPSALuc reporter construct . The K56E / K58E HIP1 mutant pro - duced a twofold greater enhancement of transcription than wild - type HIP1 under conditions of androgen stimulation ( Fig . 8 A ) . In contrast , the R1005E mutation repressed transcriptional activ - Figure 7 . Characterization of an NLS at the COOH terminus of HIP1 .

Examining androgen - treated cells expressing the R1005E mutant we noted that there was a reduction in the appar - ent nuclear translocation of the AR in cells coexpressing the AR and the mutant ( Fig . 8 B and Fig . S2 , available at http : / / www . jcb . org / cgi / content / full / jcb . 200503106 / DC1 ) . Discussion Nuclear translocation of membrane trafficking proteins It has previously been proposed that certain endocytic proteins undergoing nucleocytoplasmic shuttling might function as pro - tein scaffolds in the nucleus and exert regulatory effects on tran - scription ( Vecchi et al . , 2001 ) . Endocytic proteins first reported to undergo nucleocytoplasmic shuttling were not found to be stimulated to translocate to the nucleus upon treatment with epi - dermal growth factor or phorbol ester ( Vecchi et al . , 2001 ) . In contrast , we report here that HIP1 translocates to the nucleus and that this translocation is androgen inducible ( Fig . 1 ) . The theme of a direct integration between signal - dependent mem - brane trafficking events and transcription is a new and emerging one . The only other example of a stimulus - induced nuclear translocation of an endocytic protein is the EGF - dependent translocation of APPL ( adaptor protein containing PH domain , PTB domain , and leucine zipper motif ) to the nucleus , which complexes with histone deacetylase multiprotein complex to regulate chromatin structure and transcription ( Miaczynska et al . , 2004 ) . In contrast , HIP1 associates with a transcription fac - tor , the AR , and perhaps other members of the nuclear hormone receptor family to enhance their transcriptional activity . The overexpression of HIP1 in prostate cancer , as an en - docytic protein capable of translocating to the nucleus and co - activating androgen - dependent transcription , is of potential importance in the study of hormonal responses in prostate can - cer . A major focus of the prostate cancer field thus far has been on androgen hypersensitivity and kinase - dependent cross talk between growth factor pathways and nuclear hormone recep - tors rather than adaptor - based cross talk acting on both promot - ers and membranes ( Chen et al . , 2004 ; Culig , 2004 ) . Our work now suggests that HIP1 may be capable of such integration given the association with AREs and the coactivation of AR - mediated transcription ( Figs . 3 and 4 ) . HIP1 as a transcriptional regulator of the AR It remains to be shown whether the association between HIP1 and the AR and between HIP1 and DNA is indirect or direct . Immunoprecipitation has demonstrated an association between the AR and the FxDxF / coiled coil domain of HIP1 ( Fig . 2 , A and C ) . Mammalian two - hybrid assays suggest that the NH 2 - terminal domain of the AR is a potential binding site for HIP1 ( unpublished data ) . However , this region also binds other tran - scriptional coregulators , which could act as a molecular bridge to HIP1 , and so more detailed mapping of the interaction site in the AR is required ( Metzler et al . , 2001 ; Sampson et al . , 2001 ; Waelter et al . , 2001 ) . The function of the I / LWEQ domain of HIP1 has previ - ously proven difficult to confirm despite strong sequence homol - ogy with well - characterized actin - binding proteins ( Legendre - Guillemin et al . , 2002 ; Senetar et al . , 2004 ) . We have identified an NLS within the COOH - terminal I / LWEQ domain , which promotes the nuclear localization of GFP , and we believe that this distinguishes HIP1 from its actin - binding homologues ( Figs . 6 A and 7 ) . This motif may also explain a nuclear pool of HIP1 of variable size observed in transfected and untransfected COS7 cells by others ( unpublished data ) . The NLS , although not strong enough to localize GFP constitutively to the nucleus , suggests that HIP1 may therefore have additional nuclear func - tions and transcriptional effects that are independent of hor - monal stimulation and AR expression . HIP1 is believed to be recruited from the cytosol to mem - branes through the binding of phosphoinositides by the ANTH domain . We have demonstrated that the nuclear translocation of HIP1 is an alternative dynamic event using cytosolic HIP1 . Ablating lipid binding and therefore membrane recruitment with a double lysine mutation in the ANTH domain increases the transcriptional coactivation of HIP1 ( Figs . 6 and 8 ) . The Figure 8 . Effects of lipid binding and NLS mutations on the coregulator functions of HIP1 . ( A ) COS7 cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA3 - HIP1 , HIP1 K56E / K58E , or HIP1 R1005E constructs , pcDNA3 - AR and the pPSALuc reporter . Luciferase assays were performed after treat - ment with 10 nM Mibolerone and 1 (cid:2) M Casodex . Data shown represent the means of three independent experiments (cid:3) SD . Lysates were blotted for HIP1 and AR as well as actin as a loading control . ( B ) HIP1 R1005E was transfected into LNCaP cells undergoing steroid depletion . Cells were treated with 10 nM Mibolerone for 2 h , fixed , and stained for the AR ( red ) and with a Myc antibody for HIP1 R1005E ( green ) .

Although this mutant can still bind to the AR ( not depicted ) , the steady - state distribution of AR in R1005E - trans - fected cells is altered such that the AR appears largely cyto - solic in certain cells ( Fig . 8 B ) . Other groups have in the past reported a requirement for F - actin binding proteins in the nuclear translocation of the AR although HIP1 itself has not been found so far to bind to F - actin other than in vitro in biochemical experiments ( Ozanne et al . , 2000 ; Schrantz et al . , 2004 ; Senetar et al . , 2004 ) . Our findings imply that the R1005E mutation exerts its influence on AR sig - naling as a nuclear trafficking mutant by in part interfering with nuclear entry after androgen treatment ( Fig . 8 B and Fig . S2 ) . Previously , it has been reported that the AR shuttles in and out of the nucleus several times after androgen treatment ( Tyagi et al . , 2000 ) . Given that the NLS in HIP1 is weak and that the AR contains its own NLS motifs in the hinge domain , it is un - likely that the R1005E HIP1 mutant could block the nuclear translocation of the AR . The more plausible explanation must therefore be that the association between HIP1 and the AR oc - curs to some degree in the cytoplasm and affects the cycling and turnover of the receptor . A role for HIP1 in regulating the degra - dation or turnover of the AR is implied by the reduction in steady - state AR levels induced by HIP1 siRNA and the in - creased rate of AR degradation after the imposition of a cyclo - heximide block ( Fig . 5 ) . A link between nuclear translocation of the AR and its degradation was made when lysine mutations in the NLS of AR were shown to delay nuclear entry of the protein in response to ligand and inhibit proteasomal degradation ( Thomas et al . , 2004 ) . Degradation of native AR by a cytosolic complex incorporating the E3 ubiquitin ligase , Hsc70 interact - ing protein ( CHIP ) , was recently reported ( Thomas et al . , 2004 ) . We therefore hypothesize that the R1005E mutant delays AR nuclear translocation in response to ligand , thus making the re - ceptor available to such a complex for degradation and so re - pressing transcription . However , other factors that may contrib - ute to the striking repressive effect of the R1005E mutant on transcription by the AR include an alteration in the steady - state nucleocytoplasmic distribution of the AR or disruption to the as - sembly of an active AR transcription complex on promoters . In conclusion , the field of endocytosis is now developed enough for network theory to be applied to the large inventory of adaptors and their protein – protein and protein – lipid interac - tions ( Praefcke et al . , 2004 ) . In contrast , mapping adaptor inter - actions at a nuclear and promoter level , be it by ChIP - on - ChIP or ChIP display , is only just beginning ( Barski and Frenkel , 2004 ; Praefcke et al . , 2004 ; Wang , 2005 ) . HIP1 is an example of an emerging subset of adaptor proteins capable of nuclear translocation and associating with promoters and transcriptional machinery . It and other adaptors have been linked with cancer progression through correlative changes in expression and , in leukemias , gene fusions . Although their mechanistic contribu - tion to cancer progression remains to be elucidated , a role as transcriptional regulators at promoters may prove as significant as their involvement in membrane trafficking and endocytosis . Materials and methods Constructs and protein expression Derivatives and mutants were subcloned into pGEX4T1 or 4T2 , expressed in E . coli BL21 cells , and affinity purified before use . HIP1 expression con - structs were made with the pcDNA3 . 1 Myc - His6 expression vector as de - scribed previously ( Rao et al . , 2002 ) . GFP - tagged NLS constructs used primers spanning aa 992 – 1009 ligated into the BamHI – NotI sites of the NH 2 - terminal GFP - tagging vector pQN1 - FC3 ( Qbiogene ) , HIP1NLS ( GATCCGAATTGCAGGATCCAAGGAGCGTCAAAAACTGGGAGAGC - TTCGGAAAAAGCACTACGAGGGC ) , and HIP1R - NLS ( GATCCA - CGGCTGAGGCTGAACGCATGCGGCTGGGGGAGTTGCGGAAGCA - ACACTACGTGGGC ) . The K56E / K58E was made using sense and antisense primers incorporating the appropriate single base changes highlighted in bold : gtggctgta g aggaa g aacacgccagaacg and cgttctggcgt - gtt c ttcct c tacagccac ; and for the R1005E mutant using sense and antisense primers : gggagagctt ct caaaaagcac and gtgcttttt ga gaagctctccc using two cycling conditions for each construct . Cycling protocol 1 : 13 cycles con - sisting of 94 (cid:6) C for 40 s , 65 (cid:6) C for 30 s , and 70 (cid:6) C for 18 min and fol - lowed by a final 67 (cid:6) C extension step lasting 18 min . Cycling protocol 2 : 18 cycles consisting of 94 (cid:6) C for 40 s , 62 (cid:6) C for 30 s , and 67 (cid:6) C for 18 min and followed by a final 67 (cid:6) C extension step lasting 15 min . In both cases the template DNA was digested using DpnI , with a 37 (cid:6) C incuba - tion lasting 45 min and a subsequent denaturation step ( 65 (cid:6) C , 20 min ) before transformation into an XL - 1 Blue strain of E . coli . An NH 2 - terminal construct of HIP1 comprising aa 1 – 310 was PCR subcloned into the EcoRI – NotI sites of pGEX4T2 using a sense ( ggaattcatatggatcggatggc - cagctccatgaag ) and an antisense primer ( ttttccttttgcggccgctaagggctgatat - gttctgacagggctg ) .

Nuclei were solubilized by soni - cation , and protein concentrations of nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were determined using the BCA protein assay ( Pierce Chemical Co . ) . Equal amounts of protein from all fractions were boiled in 2 (cid:9) Laemmli sample buffer , separated by SDS - PAGE , and transferred to nitrocellulose . Membranes were blotted with antibodies to AR ( Santa Cruz Biotechnol - ogy , Inc . ) and HIP1 ( NOVUS Biologicals ) , as well as anti - lamin B ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Inc . ) and clathrin heavy chain ( Transduction Labora - tories ) that were used as nuclear and loading control probes . Primary an - tibodies were followed up with appropriate HRP - conjugated secondary antibodies ( Dako ) .
