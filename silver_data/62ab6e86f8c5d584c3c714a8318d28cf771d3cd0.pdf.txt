An architecture for non - linear discovery of aggregated multimedia document web search results Abdur Rehman Khan , Umer Rashid , Khalid Saleem and Adeel Ahmed Department of Computer Sciences , Quaid - i - Azam University , Islamabad , Pakistan ABSTRACT The recent proliferation of multimedia information on the web enhances user information need from simple textual lookup to multi - modal exploration activities . The current search engines act as major gateways to access the immense amount of multimedia data . However , access to the multimedia content is provided by aggregating disjoint multimedia search verticals . The aggregation of the multimedia search results cannot consider relationships in them and are partially blended . Additionally , the search results ’ presentation is via linear lists , which cannot support the users ’ non - linear navigation patterns to explore the multimedia search results . Contrarily , users ’ are demanding more services from search engines . It includes adequate access to navigate , explore , and discover multimedia information . Our discovery approach allow users to explore and discover multimedia information by semantically aggregating disjoint verticals using sentence embeddings and transforming snippets into conceptually similar multimedia document groups . The proposed aggregation approach retains the relationship in the retrieved multimedia search results . A non - linear graph is instantiated to augment the users ’ non - linear information navigation and exploration patterns , which leads to discovering new and interesting search results at various aggregated granularity levels . Our method ’ s empirical evaluation results achieve 99 % accuracy in the aggregation of disjoint search results at different aggregated search granularity levels . Our approach provides a standard baseline for the exploration of multimedia aggregation search results .

The progressive easy access to the internet has transformed the web into an in ﬁ nitely complex virtual organism consisting of immense multimedia content ( Batrinca & Treleaven , 2015 ) . The format of the information is now extremely varied . The individual bits of data coming from blogs , articles , web services , picture galleries , etc . , are resulting in exponential growth of multimedia data on the web ( Batrinca & Treleaven , 2015 ; Rashid & Bhatti , 2017 ) . The web is becoming the most ubiquitous platform ever since its birth and has increased in both quantity and quality ( Taheri et al . , 2018 ) . In 2009 , less than 1 petabyte of digital data was created daily ( Kumar & Ogunmola , 2020 ) . It grew to Howtocite this article Khan AR , Rashid U , SaleemK , Ahmed A . 2021 .

Distributed under Creative Commons CC - BY 4 . 0 approximately 2 . 5 exabytes in 2012 and reached 4 . 4 zettabytes in 2013 . On the web , the digital data in different formats created , replicated , and consumed exponentially ( Oussous et al . , 2018 ) . It is doubling every 2 years . By 2015 , digital data grew to 8 zettabytes , and the volume of data will reach 40 zettabytes by the end of 2020 ( Oussous et al . , 2018 ) . Keywords - based general web search engines have made early efforts to provide access to multimedia information ( Lewandowski , 2008 ) . These search engines required a user to enter one or a few keywords , and the search engines produced the relevant results in a short time ( Lewandowski , 2008 ) . Kerne & Smith ( 2004 ) ﬁ rst discussed a new search paradigm called information discovery . They elaborated discovery as a long journey of search that begins with a vague description of a problem , may have an articulated set of criteria during which a searcher specify a query and evaluate the returned information surrogates , and may continue iteratively by re - evaluating the result sets and forming a sense of desired results . Marchionini ( 2006 ) gives the same idea in a broader perspective by categorizing the search paradigm into an exploratory by incorporating not only lookup searches but learning and investigation activities . Adequate support in the users ’ search leads to the discovery of new information items . In contrast , many current search systems assume an exploratory search process as a series of homogeneous steps of submitting a query and consulting search results . Research in information seeking has shown that users go through discrete phases in their search journey , from exploring and identifying preliminary information to re ﬁ ning and narrowing their information needs and search strategies to ﬁ nalize the search . It is reported as a highly complex problem bridging the different areas of information seeking , interactive information retrieval , and user interface design ( Gäde et al . , 2015 ) . Moreover , the increasing amount of heterogeneous content on the web has transformed user needs from simple lookup - based queries to broader exploratory queries , requiring the diverse heterogeneous contents to satisfy the desired information needs ( Rashid & Bhatti , 2017 ) . Several studies indicate that more intricate tasks resulted in a diversity of the information sought and more varied approaches to information seeking ( Campbell , 2013 ) . Today , to ﬁ nd interesting multimedia content , an enormous number of users use search engines ( Deldjoo et al . , 2018 ) . It has changed users ’ information need from textual to multi - modal ( audio , image , and video ) searching . Approximately 40 – 50 % of users engage in dynamic and unplanned nature of web multimedia searches ( Tseng , Tjondronegoro & Spink , 2009 ) . When the information need is ambiguous and dynamic ( e . g . , in exploratory search ) , people often consult more multimedia search results ( Bron et al . , 2013 ) . The need for multimedia documents , in this case , increases to 58 % ( Tseng , Tjondronegoro & Spink , 2009 ) . As human information needs and search tasks become complex , the users have to collect and assemble information from diverse information sources . The goal is to compose the most appropriate responses to the tasks at hand in the form of multimedia documents ( Kopliku , Pinel - Sauvagnat & Boughanem , 2014 ) . A multimedia document is a collection of co - existing heterogeneous multimedia objects sharing the same semantics ( Rashid & Bhatti , 2017 ) . Users prefer aggregation of useful multimedia information residing in diverse sources through uni ﬁ ed interfaces ( Kopliku , Pinel - Sauvagnat & Boughanem , 2014 ; Rashid & Bhatti , 2017 ) . Similarly , the user interface presenting Khan et al . ( 2021 ) , PeerJ Comput . Sci . , DOI 10 . 7717 / peerj - cs . 449 2 / 27 aggregated contents encouraged participants to view more diversi ﬁ ed sources from the search results , and 75 % of the participants found this blended approach more comfortable to use ( Sushmita , Joho & Lalmas , 2009 ) . The user click - through rate analysis reported approximately 33 % on augmented multimedia artifacts and nearly 55 % multimedia artifacts were found relevant and useful during information exploration activities ( Sushmita et al . , 2010 ) . Overall , users explore the multimedia contents 78 % of the time to answer their dynamic information needs ( Kopliku et al . , 2011 ) . Based on recent user behavior in complex information needs , we can easily forecast even more increasing multimedia artifacts consumption from the users in satisfaction of complex information needs and discovering information . Aggregating disjoint verticals provide access to diverse multimedia documents . A vertical is de ﬁ ned as a specialized assembly of same - typed documents ( Bakrola & Gandhi , 2016 ) . This assembly can be media - speci ﬁ c or domain - speci ﬁ c . The former may include media types ( e . g . , video , blog , image , etc . ) . The latter may consist of verticals ( e . g . , travel , shopping , news , etc . ) . The aggregation process consists of either cross - vertical Aggregated Search ( cvAS ) or Relational Aggregated Search ( RAS ) . The ( cvAS ) ignores the relation during retrieval and aggregation of multimedia content . The ( RAS ) considers the relationships in the multimedia information . Despite the key - role of aggregation in bridging the modality gap , this area of research only received limited attention in the past ( Achsas & Nfaoui , 2019 ) . Without substantial creativity , this area of research will soon be abandoned . Our discovery approach aims to bring innovation and creativity in this area of search . We envision bridging the modality gap and shortcomings of current search engines , allowing users to discover multimedia information by aggregating disjoint verticals . The contributions of our solution are threefold . Firstly , we presented a creative search results aggregation technique using state - of - the - art semantic analysis . Secondly , we enhanced the current search engine shortcomings in information exploration and discovery activities by augmenting non - linear information seeking patterns . Thirdly , we bridged the information modality gap by encoding the search results in various representations . Our proposed solution is the ﬁ rst to address all of the stated challenges of information aggregation , exploration , and discovery . The rest of the discussion is organized as follows . We discuss the related work in “ Related Work ” . We highlight the de ﬁ ciencies in the existing approaches and motivation behind this research in “ Problem & Motivation ” . We provide the theoretical foundation and formalization of our proposed approach in “ Architecture Design : De ﬁ nition , Formalization & Instantiation ” . We present the implementation of the architecture in “ Architectural Implementation ” . We discuss the experimental results in “ Results ” . Finally , we compare our approach with state - of - the - art and conclude our discussion in “ Comparison & Discussion ” and “ Conclusion & Future Work ” , respectively . RELATED WORK Theoretical background and frameworks According to Kerne et al . , ( 2008 ) , information discovery tasks require ﬁ nding and collecting relevant information elements ; ﬁ ltering the collected elements ; developing an Khan et al . ( 2021 ) , PeerJ Comput . Sci . , DOI 10 . 7717 / peerj - cs . 449 3 / 27 understanding of the found elements and their relationships . The overall goal is assembling information and connecting answers to open - ended questions ( Kerne et al . , 2008 ) . It is a multidisciplinary approach and is built on anomalous states of knowledge ( Belkin , Oddy & Brooks , 1982 ) , berry - picking ( Bates , 1989 ) , psychological relevance ( Harter , 1992 ) , exploratory search ( White et al . , 2006 ) , information foraging ( Pirolli & Card , 1999 ) , information seeking ( Marchionini , 1997 ) and sensemaking ( Baldonado & Winograd , 1996 ; Russell et al . , 1993 ) . During a task performed by a user , the lack of information triggers the requisite for the information needs . The recognized information needs refer to as an anomalous state of knowledge ( Belkin , Oddy & Brooks , 1982 ) . During the recognized anomalous state of knowledge , the users refer to the information retrieval systems to initiate the information seeking journey ( Marchionini , 1997 ) . During this journey , the user picks relevant information analogous to an organism picking berries in the forest scattered on the bushes ; they do not come in bunches . One must select them one at a time ( Bates , 1989 ) . Similar to this analogy , the user has to forage for the information and pick items from information patches giving information scent the most ( Pirolli & Card , 1999 ) . Information scents are the cues that help the user in making sense of the provided information . It can be augmented by sensemaking activity . It involves making sense of the data during data analysis , searching for representation , and encoding the data to answer speci ﬁ c task - oriented questions ( Russell et al . , 1993 ) . This whole journey can incorporate lookup search , learning , and investigation activities , resulting in a non - linear search pattern . To do this non - linear search of the information successfully , researchers must leverage their skills and experience to develop search systems that actively engage searchers using semantics , inherent structure , and meaningful categorization ( White & Roth , 2009 ) . In general , the user cannot precisely specify what is needed to resolve recognized information anomaly ( Belkin , Oddy & Brooks , 1982 ) . It often results in the shortcomings of the existing retrieval systems in a scenario where the user cannot correctly formulate information need expression resulted in low precision of the retrieval systems ( Belkin , Oddy & Brooks , 1982 ) . In such case , the users ’ information needs are not fully satis ﬁ ed by a single ﬁ nal retrieved set , but by a series of selections of individual bits of information at each stage of the ever - modifying search strategies ( Bates , 1989 ) . Hence , these tasks require more recall over precision ( Tablan et al . , 2015 ) . We must consider the user perspective of information relevance , taking into account how effective the topic of the information retrieved matches the subject of interest and how to represent a piece of information that induces a change in the users ’ cognitive state ( Harter , 1992 ) . Our proposed solution encodes the multimedia search results semantically by aggregating them in multimedia documents . These documents allow users to pick the most suitable collection of information suf ﬁ cing their information need the most . Furthermore , we provide multimedia document groups , analogous to patches of information , allowing the user to forage for the information patches giving the most information scent . We increased the information scent for multimedia documents and groups by summarizing the data inside them . Semantically aggregated disjoint multimedia verticals provide the conceptualization of multimedia documents and groups . Furthermore , Khan et al . ( 2021 ) , PeerJ Comput . Sci . , DOI 10 . 7717 / peerj - cs . 449 4 / 27 we augment the non - linear information searching and seeking pattern by instantiating a non - linear graph comprising various granularity levels of search results and proximally similar multimedia content links . From federation to aggregation & diversification Traditional research mostly centered on assisting users in providing relevant multimedia information federated from various sources and information providers . Koh et al . ( 2006 ) provided discovery of search results by dispatching the user query to multiple search engines and extracting the relevant pieces of text snippets and images snapshot on the user interface . Similarly , Sushmita , Lalmas & Tombros ( 2008 ) provided a digest - based information exploration approach by collecting various pieces of multimedia information from a variety of sources and encapsulating them in the form of a digest . Afterward , researchers identi ﬁ ed the modality gap of information with enormously increasing heterogeneous content on the web , which hindered the information exploration . Hence , the ﬁ rst idea of search results aggregation was presented in a workshop at ACM SIGIR 08 conference ( Kopliku , 2009 ) . Later on , Sushmita , Joho & Lalmas ( 2009 ) advanced this idea towards the blending and evaluation of disjoint multimedia verticals into the web search results ( Sushmita et al . , 2010 ) . Information aggregation is now widely recognized , considered a bridge that narrows the information modality gap and fosters information exploration . Meanwhile , search engines are also starting to adopt a similar approach in their presentation of the search results ( Bakrola & Gandhi , 2016 ) . The progress in multimedia retrieval presented another challenge in deciding the optimal choice and position of vertical in the search engine result page and was explicitly labeled as a vertical prediction problem . Bakrola & Gandhi ( 2016 ) provided a solution to this challenge by using implicit feedback of the user in the form of several clicks and then using a support vector machine classi ﬁ er to predict the most suitable vertical suf ﬁ cing the given user information needs . Nowadays , the most common and popular commercial web search engines such as Baidu ( https : / / www . baidu . com / ) , Bing ( https : / / www . bing . com / ) , Google ( https : / / www . google . com / ) , Yahoo ! ( https : / / www . yahoo . com / ) , Yandex ( https : / / yandex . com / ) etc . , are blending some vertical - speci ﬁ c results , assembled from the other data sources into the linear ranked list of standard results . Moreover , a recent trend focuses on the information diversi ﬁ cation aspects of the information ( Taramigkou , Apostolou & Mentzas , 2017 ) . It usually involves integrating more diverse verticals ( e . g . , other than image , news , video , and web ) . This diversi ﬁ cation may include the integration of verticals from social media , shopping , movies & dramas , maps , songs , etc . However , this integration of the verticals is mostly partial - blended ( Rashid & Bhatti , 2017 ) . The relationship between the multimedia artifacts inside each disjoint vertical is often ignored . The aggregation approaches can be implmented as a multimedia or multimodal system . The multimedia system uses single modality ( usually textual metadata associated with multimedia content ) to bridge the multiple modalities ( Benavent et al . , 2013 ) . The multimodal systems incorporates multiple modalities to provide access to multimedia content ( Benavent et al . , 2013 ) . The aggregation of the multimedia artifacts demands a Khan et al . ( 2021 ) , PeerJ Comput . Sci . , DOI 10 . 7717 / peerj - cs . 449 5 / 27 better solution to enhance user interaction with the search results . It is essentially a very broad problem and answered by ( RAS ) techniques . The researchers leveraged some effort in ( Rashid & Bhatti , 2017 ) , they performed ( RAS ) using textual , visual , and acoustic descriptors of the multimedia contents . However , this multimodal aggregation was provided using a generic similarity measure for each modality and ignored the semantics relationships in aggregated multimedia documents . In ( Achsas & Nfaoui , 2018 ) , researchers presented a stacked auto - encoders model for multimedia aggregation of the disjoint verticals . However , their research addresses a small aspect of the aggregation and ignores information exploration perspectives . Renovation in information exploration data - models & semantic web The current practices for information exploration include presenting the aggregated verticals as a linear list ( Tablan et al . , 2015 ) . It is due to a lack of data - model ﬂ exibility . Initially , using the semantic web techniques and ontologies was perceived as a promising start . For instance , Tablan et al . ( 2015 ) presented an open - source semantic framework providing indexes and searches using document structure , metadata , annotations , and semantics through linked open data . The architecture supported both ; information seeking and exploration & discovery tasks by two distinct user interfaces designed , respectively . Similarly , Lisena et al . ( 2017 ) developed a modern web application for music exploration and discovery using semantic RDF graphs to establish links between entities and relationships among them . Khalili et al . ( 2017 ) used inference techniques on the semantic linked open data to produce notably unique information fostering discovery . However , due to scalability challenges in exploiting the whole web of Linked Data limits the practicality of this aspect ( Elzein et al . , 2018 ) . Similarly , in ( Kanjanakuha , Janecek & Techawut , 2019 ) , researchers provided semantic data representation in a hyperbolic tree format . Their framework consists of a 3 - layers hyperbolic tree - based modal approach that takes the input in the form of keywords from the user . The information is then presented in the form of a graph . The 3 - layer approach divides the complexity of information in each layer . It reduces the confusion caused by information overload and enhances signi ﬁ cant interaction and navigation . Similar to our proposed approach , their graph data - model provides highlighting , node describing , zooming , panning , and linking functionalities . More researchers are presently making an effort to provide a generalized approach to exploring and discovering multimedia artifacts on the web . It includes mixing different aspects of data - model , diverse information aggregation , and visualization . For instance , in ( Rashid & Bhatti , 2017 ) , researchers provided a generalized framework for relational aggregation of the multimedia artifacts belonging to disjoint sets using a graph - based visualization and exploration of a multimedia search result space . Similarly , in ( Zhang et al . , 2018 ) , researchers developed a discovery engine for arti ﬁ cial intelligence research . Their architecture crawls the web , downloads the research papers from various journal websites , and performs full - text indexing using a cosine similarity measure . It builds a similarity - based network having similarity links in documents . Users ’ stars , clicks , and tweets are primarily used to reinforce the graph ’ s essential connections . Khan et al . ( 2021 ) , PeerJ Comput . Sci . , DOI 10 . 7717 / peerj - cs . 449 6 / 27 However , the past approaches focused on using a domain - speci ﬁ c dataset and data - model using generic textual and visual similarity metrics . We establish a data - model using the semantics that exists inside the data . Speci ﬁ cally , we semantically found part - of or containment relationships in the multimedia artifacts . Moreover , we also instantiate similarity links among the multimedia artifacts that allow navigation to similar multimedia artifacts . We opt to keep the data - model as generic as possible without relying on domain knowledge and explicit feedback , making our solution implementable on a wide range of domains . PROBLEM & MOTIVATION The users ’ complex information - seeking behavior is modeled as a non - linear journey requiring adequate support during the navigation of the information space ( Ruotsalo et al . , 2018 ) . Users ’ forage for the information ( Bates , 1989 ) . Their complex information needs are not suf ﬁ ced through the current ideology of returning the most precise information in response to the given queries ( Russell - Rose & Tate , 2012 ) . Instead , users pick the most interesting items like barries from various patches of information , providing more information scent ratio to the effort required for examining the information . It results in a non - linear information searching pattern of users ( Russell - Rose & Tate , 2012 ) . The search engines are more tuned towards simple lookup searches favoring precision over recall ( Tablan et al . , 2015 ) . However , even though they have recognized the users ’ multimedia information needs and started to blend some vertical - speci ﬁ c results assembled from the other data sources ( Bakrola & Gandhi , 2016 ) . The current practices of presenting information in a linear ranked list of standard results limit information exploration ( Rashid & Bhatti , 2017 ) . Furthermore , the integration of the verticals is mostly partial - blended ( Rashid & Bhatti , 2017 ) , which may suf ﬁ ce in simple lookup searches when a user knows what to look for ; however , this strategy inadequately support complex information exploration and discovery tasks ( Tablan et al . , 2015 ) . These tasks go beyond simple keyword - based queries . Users often have dif ﬁ culties in information need expression , and they usually are dynamic ( Ruotsalo et al . , 2015a ) . Such tasks require more recall over precision and diversity of information sources ( Tablan et al . , 2015 ) . It challenges the current practices of displaying the search results belonging to different verticals as disjoint sets ( Rashid & Bhatti , 2017 ) . On the other hand , the search engines remain almost the same as they were about a decade ago . There exist numerous problems ( P ) with current search engines . The Fig . 1 shows the difference between the Google Search Engine Results Page ( SERP ) back in 2010 ( Sullivan , 2020 ) and now in 2020 ( Google , 2020 ) . The verticals are integrated as disjoint components ( P 1 ) . The relationships between multimedia objects are ignored ( P 2 ) . The information presented is still displayed as linear lists ( P 3 ) . This presentation of the general search engines ’ information may suf ﬁ ce for simple lookup tasks but lacks adequacy for complex exploratory and discovery tasks ( Klouche et al . , 2015 ) . These tasks require increased recall over precision ( P 4 ) , information scent ( P 5 ) , and sensemaking ( P 6 ) . The existing exploration approaches ’ de ﬁ ciencies demand a better mechanism to encode and present the multimedia information for discovery ( P 7 ) . Khan et al . ( 2021 ) , PeerJ Comput . Sci . , DOI 10 . 7717 / peerj - cs . 449 7 / 27 ARCHITECTURE DESIGN : DEFINITION , FORMALIZATION & INSTANTIATION Existing techniques are usually speci ﬁ c to a problem and employed on a particular dataset . Many researchers consider one side of the discovery , such as information diversi ﬁ cation , visualization , data - modal etc . , and ignore the other factors highlighted in the previous section . To the best of our knowledge , a generalized multimedia search results discovery mechanism , particularly in aggregated search , is the ﬁ rst to address in this research . Notably , we provided a balanced architectural approach for information discovery , emphasizing the dataset , data - model , and information diversi ﬁ cation equally . We used real - dataset retrieved from the search engines in real - time . We instantiated a non - linear graph data modal consisting of diverse information while preserving the semantics and similarity relationships . Finally , we provided a theoretical background to foster exploration and discovery activities . Our component - based architecture design includes sub - components . Each sub - component produces a consumable output . There are ﬁ ve main components , referred to as ( A ) Search Results Aggregation ; ( B ) Multimedia Document Creation ; ( C ) Multimedia Figure 1 Comparison of Google SERP between 2010 ( left ) and 2020 ( right ) .

Each component is concerned with delegated responsibility , and their internal working is separate from each other . A discussion on each component is provided in the following sections . ( A ) Search results retrieval & aggregation Search results retrieved from the search engines are presented in the form of disjoint verticals . Adversely , users ’ information needs are becoming complex and multi - modal , requiring the employment of multimedia artifacts for satisfaction . To aggregate scattered disjoint verticals ( P 1 ) , we introduced a search results aggregation component . The aggregation process of this component is subdivided into three steps . ( i ) Vertical retrieval De ﬁ nition : We de ﬁ ne vertical as a specialized assembly of same - typed search results and retrieval as a process of obtaining them from some external source .

Sci . , DOI 10 . 7717 / peerj - cs . 449 9 / 27 Formalization : Let S be the set of α , β , γ , λ respectively given as S = { α , β , γ , λ } , where α is de ﬁ ned as a set of video snippets V given as α = { { V ψ 1 , V ψ 2 , V ψ 3 , … , V ψ n } , { V ϕ 1 , V ϕ 2 , V ϕ 3 , … , V ϕ n } } , β is de ﬁ ned as a set of news snippets N given as β = { { N ψ 1 , N ψ 2 , N ψ 3 , … , N ψ n } , { N ϕ 1 , N ϕ 2 , N ϕ 3 , … , N ϕ n } } , γ is de ﬁ ned as a set of image snippets I given as c ¼ ff I w 1 ; I w 2 ; I w 3 ; … ; I w n g ; f I (cid:1) 1 ; I (cid:1) 2 ; I (cid:1) 3 ; … ; I (cid:1) n gg , and λ is de ﬁ ned as a set of web snippets W given as λ = { W ψ 1 , W ψ 2 , W ψ 3 , … , W ψ n } , where ψ and ϕ denotes the textual and visual modality associated with a snippet respectively . Instantiation : We retrieved top hundred search results from each web , news , image , and video verticals . Since exploratory and discovery tasks require increased recall over precision ( P 4 ) , we chose to retrieve maximum search results from the API provider . With each search result , we preserve the metadata associate with it . The verticals are retrieved from the Google search engine in real - time because Google is highly preferred by web users ( Ali & Gul , 2016 ) . The Table 1 shows the vertical retrieval parameters . Figure 3 outlines the possible features of a snippet . ( ii ) Verticals aggregation De ﬁ nition : We de ﬁ ne verticals aggregation as a single container of all the retrieved disjoint verticals . Formalization : Let X be the subset of S consisting of the all the elements α , β , γ and λ from S . We consider only textual modality information given as X ¼ P ni ¼ 1 S w i . Instantiation : Each retrieved snippet has unwanted data ( e . g . , HTML tags , numbers , special characters , etc . ) . These impurities do not add meaning to the semantic analysis .

Sci . , DOI 10 . 7717 / peerj - cs . 449 10 / 27 We are restraining to perform extra pre - processing steps such as stopwords removal and stemming . It results in the loss of contextual information necessary for semantic analysis . Afterward , we preserve the scattered disjoint verticals textual data inside a single container as a linear list . ( B ) Multimedia document creation Previous studies indicate user interest in exploring multimedia documents encapsulating relevant multimedia objects during information exploration ( Rashid & Bhatti , 2017 ) . We de ﬁ ne a multimedia document as a semantic container of similar content belonging to multiple modalities . Instead of providing a linear list of snippets , which forces web users to locate scattered relevant multimedia objects from disjoint verticals , we give document - based multimedia exploration ( P 6 ) . The multimedia document semantically gathers the scattered multimedia objects belonging to various disjoint verticals . This process is again sub - divided into three steps . ( i ) Semantic analysis De ﬁ nition : We de ﬁ ne semantic analysis as a process of obtaining semantic information ( relatedness and containment ) from transformed multidimensional vector representation of search results textual data ( P 2 ) . Formalization : ∀ x ε X let E x be the set of sentence embedding given as E x = { e 1 , e 2 , e 3 , … , e n } , where each element in E x is represented by a multidimensional vector e ! ¼ ð r 1 ; r 2 ; r 3 ; … ; r 768 Þ ; r e ð R Þ . Instantiation : Firstly , we transformed each multimedia snippet in the aggregated list into sentence embeddings . This transforms each snippet into a multidimensional vector space for semantic analysis . Since each snippet contains minimal textual description , sentence embedding is deemed a better choice over the Doc2Vec technique . ( ii ) Clustering De ﬁ nition : We de ﬁ ne clustering as a process of grouping the search results , having highly related intra - group coherence and otherwise for the inter - group search results . Formalization : E x = c 1 ∪ … c i ∪ c n ; c i ∩ c j = 0 ( i ≠ j ) , where E x denotes original data , c i , c j are clusters of E x and n is the number of clusters . Let C d be the set of clusters of E x given as C d = { c 1 , c 2 , c 3 , … , c n } , where each cluster contains a set of coherent text t and c = { t 1 , t 2 , t 3 , … , t n } . Instantiation : We performed the agglomerative clustering on all the semantic search results vectors . Agglomerative clustering is chosen due to ﬂ exibility in the clustering process as it allows the clusters to be obtained using cut - off criteria instead of prede ﬁ ned number of clusters . This process groups similar search results in various buckets , called multimedia document . ( iii ) Summarization De ﬁ nition : We de ﬁ ne summarization as a process of extracting the most representative words from the bucket of search results . Khan et al . ( 2021 ) , PeerJ Comput . Sci . , DOI 10 . 7717 / peerj - cs . 449 11 / 27 Formalization : Let W d be a set of words sequence w from c ε C d , generated by text summarizer representing the collection of text given in c as W d = { w 1 , w 2 , w 3 , … , w n } , let M d be the multimedia document , we formed M d by mapping function M d ¼ 8ð C d Þ8ð W d Þð f ð C d Þ ¼ f ð W d Þ ! C d ¼ W d Þ . Instantiation : To enhance sensemaking ( P 6 ) , instead of merely labeling a multimedia document by assigning prede ﬁ ned categories , we are performing summarization based on the text of the snippets inside the multimedia document . Speci ﬁ cally , we perform extractive text summarization techniques to extract the combination of the most representing text inside the multimedia document for its representation . ( C ) Multimedia document grouping Prior research has shown that web user information exploration behavior is analogous to a foraging animal in the forest ( Pirolli & Card , 1999 ) . They look for the patches containing more information scent as compared to the effort performed . In traditional linear list presentation of the search results , a user has extreme dif ﬁ culty locating the appropriate patches of information and comprehending search results space ( Ruotsalo et al . , 2015b ) . This component groups multimedia documents to provide patches of information and enhance search results in space comprehension ( P 5 ) . This process is sub - divided into three steps . ( i ) Semantic analysis De ﬁ nition : We de ﬁ ne semantic analysis as a process of obtaining semantic information ( relatedness and containment ) from transformed multidimensional vector representation of multimedia documents . Formalization : From W d , we produce the set Y to perform semantic analysis , given as Y ¼ P ni ¼ 1 W di . ∀ y ε Y let M x be the set of sentence embedding given as M x = { e 1 , e 2 , e 3 , … , e n } , where each element in M x is represented by a multidimensional vector e ! ¼ ð r 1 ; r 2 ; r 3 ; … ; r 768 Þ ; r e ð R Þ . Instantiation : Firstly , we extract summaries of multimedia documents and aggregated them inside a linear list . Then we performed semantic analysis on each multimedia document summary using sentence embeddings . This transformed each multimedia document to a multidimensional vector space for semantic analysis . Similarly , since each multimedia document contains minimal textual description , sentence embedding is deemed a better choice over the Doc2Vec technique . ( ii ) Clustering De ﬁ nition : We de ﬁ ne clustering as a process of grouping the multimedia documents having high intra - group relatedness and otherwise for the inter - group multimedia documents . Formalization : Let M x = c 1 ∪ … c i ∪ c n ; c i ∩ c j = ø ( i ≠ j ) , where M x denotes original data , c i , c j are clusters of M x and n is the number of clusters . Let C g be the set of clusters of M x given as C g = { c 1 , c 2 , c 3 , … , c n } , where each cluster contains a set of coherent text t and c = { t 1 , t 2 , t 3 , … , t n } . Khan et al . ( 2021 ) , PeerJ Comput . Sci . , DOI 10 . 7717 / peerj - cs . 449 12 / 27 Instantiation : We performed the agglomerative clustering on all the semantic vectors of multimedia document summaries . Similarly , agglomerative clustering is chosen for ﬂ exibility in clusters creation process using a cut - off criteria . This process groups similar multimedia documents in various buckets . ( iii ) Summarization De ﬁ nition : We de ﬁ ne summarization as a process of extracting the most representative words from the bucket of multimedia documents . Formalization : Let C g be the set of clusters of M x given as C g = { c 1 , c 2 , c 3 , … , c n } , where each cluster contains a set of similar text t c = { t 1 , t 2 , t 3 , … , t n } ; t ε C g . Text summarizer W g produces a set of words sequence w from c ε C g representing the collection of text given in c as W g = { w 1 , w 2 , w 3 , … , w n } . Similarly , let M c be the multimedia document cluster , we formed M c by mapping function M c ¼ 8ð C g Þ8ð W g Þð f ð C g Þ ¼ f ð W g Þ ! C g ¼ W g Þ . Instantiation : We call each generated bucket of multimedia documents from the clustering process a multimedia document group . To enhance sensemaking , instead of merely labeling a multimedia document group by arranging them in taxonomic order , we perform summarization based on the multimedia document summary . The summarization process is performed using extractive text summarization technique . This extracts the most representing text inside the multimedia document group . ( D ) Graph instantiation Present search engines display the search results in a linear list and often ignores the relationship between multimedia content . As a result , users have to navigate the results space and berry - pick the relevant items of interest ( Bates , 1989 ) . This results in a non - linear searching pattern of a user in the exploration of information ( Bates , 1989 ) . To overcome these challenges , we instantiated a non - linear graph augmenting the users ’ non - linear exploratory information - seeking behavior while preserving the relationships ( P 3 ) . This process is sub - divided into three steps , as well . ( i ) Vertices creation De ﬁ nition : We de ﬁ ne vertex as an atomic data structure encapsulating the complete details of the representing entity . Formalization : Let a graph G be a set of vertices V and edges E , given as G = ( V , E ) and vertices V represent all the vertical snippets , multimedia documents and clusters given as V = { S , M d , M c } . Instantiation : Firstly , we represented each multimedia document group , multimedia document , and multimedia snippet as a vertex . We associate with each vertex the metadata . It includes a text summary for the multimedia documents and multimedia document groups . Similarly , metadata belonging to the multimedia snippet include their title , description , URI , date , and thumbnail ( where available ) . Khan et al . ( 2021 ) , PeerJ Comput . Sci . , DOI 10 . 7717 / peerj - cs . 449 13 / 27 ( ii ) Part - of linking De ﬁ nition : We de ﬁ ne part - of linking as a process of establishing containment relationship between vertices . Formalization : The edge ( δ ) between the S and M d denotes the part - of relationship given as δ : ∀ x ε S , ∃ d ε M d , f ( M d ) = S . Similarly , edge ( δ ) between the M d and M c denotes the part - of relationship given as δ : ∀ m ε M d , ∃ c ε M c , f ( M c ) = M d . Instantiation : Since a multimedia document is a part of some multimedia documents group , similarly , a multimedia snippet is a part of some multimedia document , the edges established between them represents the part - of ( or containment ) relationship . ( iii ) Similarity linking De ﬁ nition : We de ﬁ ne similarity linking as a process of establishing proximally similarity - based relationship between vertices . Formalization : Edges ( δ ) among M c denotes the similarity relationship based on Cartesian product of M c given as : d : M c (cid:2) M c ¼ P n i ¼ 1 P n j ¼ i þ 1 J ð M ci ; M cj Þ ; if . h [ ; otherwise 8 < : Similarly , edges ( δ ) among M d in each M c denotes the similarity relationship based on Cartesian product of M d within M c given as : d : P n k ¼ 1 M ck 8 M d e M ck : M d (cid:2) M d ¼ P n i ¼ 1 P n j ¼ i þ 1 J ð M di ; M dj Þ ; if J . h [ ; otherwise 8 < : where J is the Jaccard similarity de ﬁ ned as J ð A ; B Þ ¼ j A \ B j j A [ B j and θ is the average similarity score of all the selected vertices pairs in the graph . Instantiation : Exploratory search also involves navigation of proximally similar multimedia documents in the collection ( Savolainen , 2018 ) . It helps a user explore the environment to understand better how to exploit it , selectively seek and implicitly obtain cues about coming steps ( Savolainen , 2018 ) . Hence , we provide navigational links to proximally similar multimedia document groups and multimedia documents . These links are established if there is a high proximal similarity between the source and destination vertices . We chose the Jaccard similarity measure because it is computationally less expensive than other similarity techniques ( Rashid & Bhatti , 2017 ) . ( E ) Semantic lookup list At present , the aggregation of the verticals on the major search engines is provided as partially - blended . The relationship between the multimedia snippets in those retrieved disjoint verticals is ignored ( Rashid & Bhatti , 2017 ) . On the other hand , information lookup is an eminent component of information exploration and discovery , and linear lookup lists have proven to be effective in information lookup ( Tablan et al . , 2015 ) . To overcome this challenge of disjoint and relation - less aggregation of the verticals and provide ease in lookup searches , we introduce a semantic lookup list component that Khan et al . ( 2021 ) , PeerJ Comput . Sci . , DOI 10 . 7717 / peerj - cs . 449 14 / 27 fully - blends the disjoint verticals using semantics of the multimedia snippets ( P 1 ) . This component consists of two steps . ( i ) Similarity calculation De ﬁ nition : We de ﬁ ne similarity calculation as a process of extracting numeric similarity score between pairs of text using a textual similarity measure . Formalization : Let the E x be the same set of sentence described previously , we also transformed user query Q as a sentence embedding Q x represented by Q x (cid:2) ! ¼ f r 1 ; r 2 ; r 3 ; … ; r 768 g ; r e ð R Þ . We calculated similarity as L s ¼ f8 e ! e E x j 0 (cid:3) SIM ð Q x (cid:2) ! ; e ! Þ (cid:3) 1 g , using a cosine similarity measure de ﬁ ned as SIM ð Q x (cid:2) ! ; e ! Þ ¼ Q x (cid:2) ! : e ! Q x (cid:2) ! (cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3) (cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3) (cid:2) e ! (cid:3)(cid:3) (cid:3)(cid:3) . Instantiation : In this part , we transform the user query itself into the sentence embeddings . This transformation eliminates the data representation gap . We perform a similarity calculation operation on the pair - wise ( query and each snippet embedding ) obtained semantics using a cosine similarity measure . We use cosine similarity because our query and search results are in vector representation . ( ii ) Re - ranking De ﬁ nition : We de ﬁ ne re - ranking as a process of arranging search results in descending order of query and search results embedding pairwise intra - similarity scores . Formalization : Using similarity scores L s , we de ﬁ ne L r the ranked linear search results list , sorted in descending order of similarity , given as L r = { l 1 , … , l | X | | f ( l i ) ≥ f ( l j ) , i < j ≤ | X | , l i , l j ∈ X } , where f : X / L s . Instantiation : In lookup searches , the ordering of information is mandatory . The most relevant information must be present on the most top . The search engines return disjoint ranked verticals . To calculate the ranking order for snippets belonging to aggregated disjoint verticals , we re - rank each multimedia snippet in their descending order of similarity , allowing the most relevant snippet to appear ﬁ rst on the linear list . ARCHITECTURAL IMPLEMENTATION We implemented our architecture in Python 3 programming language using publicly available libraries . Search results are retrieved using freely available APIs to fetch the verticals from a search engine in real - time . We used Google search engine to retrieve the search results belonging to the web , news , image , and video verticals . We preserved the metadata associated with each snippet , such as the URL , title , date , length , description , and thumbnail , where available . For text summarization , we used LexRank ( https : / / gist . github . com / rodricios / fee45381356c8fb36004 / ) extractive text summarization algorithm . Semantic analysis is done using SBERT ’ s ( https : / / pypi . org / project / sentence - transformers / ) sentence embedding on pre - optimized bert − base − nli − mean − tokens ( https : / / github . com / UKPLab / sentence - transformers / ) pre - trained modal and agglomerative clustering using the ward ’ s linkage method from sklearn ( https : / / scikit - learn . org / ) python library to Khan et al . ( 2021 ) , PeerJ Comput . Sci . , DOI 10 . 7717 / peerj - cs . 449 15 / 27 obtain the clusters . We used Networkx ( https : / / networkx . github . io / ) python library to instantiate an undirected network to build the graph . Each node represented either a web snippet , multimedia document , or a multimedia document cluster . The snippet nodes attribute includes their metadata . The multimedia document and multimedia document cluster nodes attribute include their summarized text . Figure 4 shows the visualization of the instantiated graph generated from Cytoscape ( https : / / cytoscape . org / ) . RESULTS There is still no standard empirical evaluation measures for evaluating the aggregated search approach effectiveness ( Li et al . , 2017 ) . These approaches are mostly considered in terms of the achieved precision & recall ( Rashid & Bhatti , 2017 ) and judgment reports from the human experts ( Ruotsalo et al . , 2018 ) . Calculating precision and recall in our case is a non - trivial task . It is mainly due to the nature of the data . Therefore , we used a real dataset with no prior labeling by human experts . Our empirical evaluation measures mostly depend on metrics requiring no initial labeling of data . We used internal clustering stability measures to evaluate the internal cluster model stability ( Wani & Riyaz , 2016 ) , and clustering accuracy based on the judgment of the human experts ( Ruotsalo et al . , Figure 4 Visualization of the instantiated graph . The orange and pink color represents cluster and multimedia document respectively . The rest denotes snippets belonging to disjoint verticals . Full - size  DOI : 10 . 7717 / peerj - cs . 449 / ﬁ g - 4 Khan et al . ( 2021 ) , PeerJ Comput . Sci . , DOI 10 . 7717 / peerj - cs . 449 16 / 27 2018 ) . We obtained accuracy and stability scores by dispatching pre - de ﬁ ned queries on Google ’ s real dataset . We collected queries from the recently published ORCAS ( Craswell et al . , 2020 ) dataset consisting of 10 million distinct records . Selecting all queries in the dataset for evaluation purposes was not practical . Hence , we performed bi - gram and tri - gram query analysis on the ORCAS dataset . Afterward , we selected 25 queries from the top 100 most repeating bi - gram and tri - gram combinations . The average query length for this evaluation was set to 2 . 5 words . The chosen length was due to a recent study in ( Degbelo & Teka , 2019 ) indicating average user query length between 2 . 44 and 2 . 67 words , which con ﬁ rms that users ’ information needs are becoming exploratory . Since in exploratory search , user needs are ambiguous , and the primary objective is to gain an overview of the information . Users type short queries instead of well - articulated longer queries as in the lookup search scenarios ( Athukorala et al . , 2016 ) . We selected queries covering broad aspects . Therefore , an average query length of 2 . 5 words was considered based on the average of 2 . 44 and 2 . 67 words . Internal clustering parameterizing We used agglomerative clustering for the creation of multimedia documents and multimedia documents groups . We speci ﬁ ed cut - off threshold criteria for the cluster creation process θ to form the desired number of clusters . We chose θ empirically by determining the best possible average mean value of internal cluster stability measures . We used a well - known Rousseeuw ( 1987 ) Silhouette Coef ﬁ cient ( SC ) , Cali ń ski & Harabasz ( 1974 ) Index ( CHI ) and Davies & Bouldin ( 1979 ) Index ( DBI ) to calculate internal cluster stability . We calculated the mean average value of θ 1 by performing ﬁ ve experiments and taking their mean value to create multimedia documents . Based on the obtained θ 1 threshold , we again repeated the same procedure for multimedia documents clustering to obtain θ 2 . This process of obtaining θ 1 and θ 2 is displayed in Table 2 . Finally , we parameterized the clustering model for multimedia documents and documents clusters based on empirically obtained values , as displayed in Table 4 . Clustering precision Precision is referred to as a fraction of relevant retrieved out of total relevant results ( Rashid & Bhatti , 2017 ) . In clustering , precision is a fraction of relevant results out of total results inside a cluster . Precision is mostly calculated by cross - matching obtained cluster results with correct labeled data . In a real dataset , the labeling of data is unavailable . We logged the search results retrieved from the pre - de ﬁ ned queries during the empirical internal clustering model parameterization process to overcome this challenge . These logged search results were then presented to two human experts to label relevant and irrelevant search results inside each cluster . The existing literature mostly use two human experts for veri ﬁ cation of the judgments between the experts ( Achsas & Nfaoui , 2018 ; Koh et al . , 2006 ; Taramigkou , Apostolou & Mentzas , 2017 ) . To perform the rigorous expert - based evaluation , we hired two human experts from opposite backgrounds , we then statistically measured their amount of agreement . To the best of our knowledge , this Khan et al . ( 2021 ) , PeerJ Comput . Sci . , DOI 10 . 7717 / peerj - cs . 449 17 / 27 human - expert background diversity and their inter - relevance agreeability has not been considered previously . The ﬁ rst human expert is a graduate in education and had no prior knowledge about computing - related technical aspects . The second human expert is a graduate in computer science and had substantial knowledge about computing technical aspects , including the concept of clustering . This diversity in the background helps in obtaining unbiased validation of our clustering approach . Table 3 show the results obtained from the human experts . We run a total of 25 experiments , divided into 5 iterations . From each iteration , we obtained the mean results . Afterward , we took the mean average of 5 iterations . This process was repeated for both ; the multimedia documents and multimedia document groups . The results show no Table 2 Empirical clustering results for ( 1 ) Multimedia Documents ( 2 ) Multimedia document groups .

COMPARISON & DISCUSSION Our approach outperforms in terms of accuracy ( 99 % ) in comparison to the approach provided by Achsas & Nfaoui ( 2018 ) ( 89 % ) . It mainly can be due to variations in the data used for model training , choice of deep learning model , and parameterization process . We have performed rigorous and statistically signi ﬁ cant empirical evaluation using average scores from human experts having diverse backgrounds and internal clustering stability measures . It presents as a baseline , and a promising start for future search results aggregation approaches . This signi ﬁ es that the previous researches in this domain are excessively concerned with innovations in the existing techniques , which we believe , is unnecessary while the present search engines are still suffering from the major issues discussed in this paper . We also made an effort to emphasize the fact that the existing techniques are suf ﬁ ciently optimized to solve real issues and there exists a need for attention from the researchers towards more emerging trends . Each research utilizes different techniques and mechanisms to provide information exploration and discovery . We have extracted the major parameters and their possible values for an in - depth comparison of our approach with existing state - of - the - art . To ease comprehension of these parameters , we have further categorized parameters according to their purpose , as displayed in the Table 5 . The provided functionalities are marked with the “ + ” symbol , whereas the missing functionalities are left blank . Table 5 emphasizes the three signi ﬁ cant aspects of discovery techniques . The ﬁ rst aspect is searching for search results , including search type , search results granularity , and searching activity . The second aspect concerns data management , including information sources , instantiation of data - modal , and assembling mechanism . Finally , the third aspect is concerned with technical information retrieval aspects of the discovery and exploratory approaches , including media sources and information retrieval modal . The most crucial factor in information discovery is ﬂ exibility in representing the information to avoid information overload . Most of the existing research solely relies on ﬁ ltering capabilities but lacks in providing appropriate granularity control of the search results ( di Sciascio , Sabol & Veas , 2016 ) . Our approach provides three - level granularity ; snippets , multimedia documents , and multimedia documents clusters . The data - modals employed by the existing researches are mostly centered around a speci ﬁ c domain and speci ﬁ c data .

Approaches providing real datasets were also primarily concerned with integrating a few verticals such as web and image ( Koh et al . , 2006 ) . To enable our approach to be generic and applicable to all the domains and datasets , we presently use only real datasets to observe our approach ’ s integrity even in the most variate and uncertain data coming from the search engines in real - time . Information exploration and discovery is a long , non - trivial , and non - linear journey . To foster non - linear navigation of the search results , existing literature mostly instantiated a graph data - modal using either existing domain knowledge , such as ontologies ( Khalili et al . , 2017 ; Lisena et al . , 2017 ; Kanjanakuha , Janecek & Techawut , 2019 ) , or using some generic similarity measures ( Rashid & Bhatti , 2017 ) . Our approach uses domain - independent semantics and similarity measures to construct a non - linear graph to provide non - linear means of search results exploration and discovery . Information management is also an essential factor in enabling information discovery and a compelling exploration of the search results . Numerous information management approaches organize and present the users ’ search results , increasing their cognitive abilities . These approaches include linear and non - linear browsing of information and summarization . However , previously , these were implemented as disjoint components , combined on a single interface ( Fung & Thanadechteemapat , 2010 ) . Our approach uni ﬁ es all of the speci ﬁ c techniques and encapsulates it in a single component . With our generic information discovery architecture based on a strong theoretical background and promising empirical evaluation results , we hope to provide a new baseline for future researches on relational aggregated search and search engines alike . CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK In this research , we proposed a generic discovery architecture using multimedia search engine results . A brief discussion on information exploration and theoretical discovery background was provided , and an architectural solution was formalized and instantiated . Before this work , the exploration and discovery of information on the web search engine were leveraged using traditional heuristics . We identi ﬁ ed potential gaps and issues in the current general web search engine approach . To overcome these issues , we presented a new baseline using search results aggregation . Our approach was employed using state - of - the - art sentence embeddings . We bridged the gap between the abundant multimedia contents by encapsulating semantically multimedia artifacts in multimedia documents and summarizing them . Moreover , we eased the navigation problem in the search results space by grouping multimedia documents in semantically similar patches . The proposed discovery architecture emphasizes all the aspects of the discovery , including information exploration and lookup . We supported information exploration by providing the nonlinear proximal navigation and exploration support through the instantiation of a complex graph and lookup searches through a semantically fully - blended ordered linear search results list . Finally , a comprehensive empirical evaluation was presented . The empirical evaluation out - performed previous aggregation approaches at all granularity levels of aggregation provided in this research . To the best of our knowledge , our approach is the ﬁ rst to be assessed comprehensively from the system and the user Khan et al . ( 2021 ) , PeerJ Comput . Sci . , DOI 10 . 7717 / peerj - cs . 449 22 / 27 perspective on the dataset and the queries obtained from the user and the search engine , respectively , in real - time . We believe that the user experience and the user interface both play an important role to in ﬂ uence information discovery . This aspect requires a detailed and comprehensive discussion , which was out of the scope of this research . In the future , we look forward to providing a more ablative evaluation from the usability perspective of architecture involving an even broader audience with extremely varied backgrounds and experiences with more focus on human aspects , including user interfaces . We have intentions to provide the adaptable clustering of multimedia documents by considering the users ’ diverse information need and information - seeking behavior . We are interested in investigating multimodal verticals aggregation and exploiting various nonlinear data models consisting of multiple modalities in the enhanced discovery of aggregated multimedia based document search results in real - time scenarios .
