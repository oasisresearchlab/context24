However , the growth of these communities has led to a large influx of ideas of mixed quality , which has made it difficult for firm experts to select and implement ideas . In this paper we propose a novel theoretical framework to ( 1 ) extract important features from a collaborative crowdsourcing community and ( 2 ) apply them to the practice of recommending ideas that are most likely to be implemented in the future . More specifically , we adopt the design science research paradigm , introduce the knowledge persuasion model as the kernel theory , operate users’ persuasive attempts and firm experts’ persuasive coping , and identify a rich set of features as predictors of the likelihood of idea implementation . We test our prediction framework on a large - scale collaborative crowdsourcing community . The results of our data analysis show that the proposed framework is effective and efficient in predicting the likelihood of idea implementation . To increase the interpretability of the prediction model , we also implement the SHapley Additive exPlanations ( SHAP ) analysis and discuss the relationships between important features and idea implementation . We conclude by discussing the theoretical and practical implications of these findings . Keywords : idea recommendation , persuasion attempt , persuasion coping , prediction model , interpretable machine learning 1 1 . Introduction Compared to ideas generated by firms’ internal research and development ( R & D ) departments , ideas from external users are especially valuable to firms because they often contain a greater degree of novelty and greater commercial value ( Magnusson , 2009 ; Poetz & Schreier , 2012 ) . However , it is difficult for firms to access users’ ideas because they are located outside the organization ( Schweisfurth , 2017 ) . A potential solution to this problem is to establish collaborative crowdsourcing communities for open innovation . Prominent examples of open innovation platforms include Dell’s IdeaStorm ( Bayus 2013 ) , Starbucks’s MyStarbucksIdea ( Sullivan , 2010 ) , and Xiaomi’s MIUI ( Liu et al . 2020 ) . In collaborative crowdsourcing communities , users participate in firms’ new product or service development and continually generate and submit new ideas to the company ( Djelassi & Decoopman , 2013 ) . Firms adopt the users’ ideas which they consider valuable and incorporate them into their new products , which can ultimately result in offerings that better meet user demands or preferences ( Schlagwein & Bjørn - Andersen , 2014 ) . Through collaborative crowdsourcing , firms effectively integrate internal and external resources to achieve open innovation in new products development ( Brabham , 2009 ; Howe , 2006 ) . Experts within firms play a critical role in collaborative crowdsourcing , serving as a bridge between external users and internal R & D departments . These experts work on behalf of the firm to identify valuable ideas generated by external users and internalize them into the organizational knowledge to be applied to the open innovation of new products ( Di Gangi et al . , 2010 ) . They typically determine which ideas should be implemented and which are abandoned . However , when the sheer volume of user ideas , it becomes very challenging for these experts to sift through and identify the ideas that are worth implementing ( Di Gangi et al . , 2010 ; Schulze & Hoegl , 2008 ) . For example , since the IdeaStorm launch in 2007 , only 2 . 2 % of the 2 ideas offered have been implemented , that is , out of 25 , 186 ideas presented , DELL identified 549 as worth implementing ( Hoornaert et al . , 2017 ) . MyStarbucksIdea’s idea implementation rate is 0 . 2 % ( 320 implemented ideas out of 162 , 156 submitted ideas ) , since the community launch in 2008 ( Hossain & Islam , 2015 ) . The information overload faced by firm experts is increasing rapidly , often requiring significant time and effort to manually process and select worthy ideas out of a large amount of low - quality or repetitive information . To lower firm experts’ excessive evaluation costs , some online communities introduce topic labels / keyword tags , which to some extent help firm experts obtain information on related topics quickly . Yet , this does not completely resolve the issue and firm experts still need to read and respond to each idea individually . Some communities use a crowd - based evaluation system , such as ratings , to screen for high - quality information . However , providing a rating is voluntary and participation is often very low , which leads to a systematic problem of “errors of omission” ( Cao et al . , 2011 ; Liu et al . , 2020 ) . As a result , there is an urgent practical need to automatically identify ideas with potential for implementation to help firm experts efficiently select and evaluate the most promising options ( Blohm et al . , 2011 ; Dahan et al . , 2010 ) . A potential solution is to adopt a machine - learning approach that automatically predicts user ideas and their implementation possibilities . Our research constructs an idea - recommendation model in open innovation platforms to assist firm experts in filtering ideas automatically . According to the research paradigm of design science ( Hevner et al . , 2004 ) , information system design theory ( ISDT ) ( Walls et al . , 1992 ) , we first introduce the persuasion knowledge model ( PKM ) ( Fristard & Wright , 1994 ) as the kernel theory to explain idea implementation . Second , we use meta - requirements to operationalize idea implementation as the persuasive outcome of 3 agents’ persuasion attempts and targets’ persuasion coping . Third , we use meta - design operationalization to meet the computable dimensions of the meta - requirements . Fourth , to test the efficacy of our model , we collected 110 , 384 idea threads from an open innovation community - - Xiaomi’s MIUI forum . We construct two models for predicting idea implementation : the proposed PKM - based model and the “3Cs” model ( Hoornaert et al . , 2017 ) . Then , we compare the model performance with two design evaluation tasks . Lastly , we apply SHapley Additive exPlanations ( SHAP ) analysis to understand the advantages of the proposed model , particularly the importance and specific effects of each proposed feature . Moreover , we conduct a feature selection procedure to find a quasi - optimal subset of features for idea implementation prediction . This study makes several notable contributions to the open innovation literature . First , we construct a multilevel analysis framework for idea implementation based on PKM , which contains a comprehensive and concise feature set for predicting the likelihood of idea implementation . Second , we introduce PKM and provide a new theoretical explanation for the idea implementation . Unlike the theoretical logic of creative value ( Bayus , 2013 ) , we propose that the ides implementation results from a dyadic persuasion process in which users make persuasion attempts and firm experts practice persuasion coping ( Friestad & Wright , 1994 ) . Third , based on the theory - driven design paradigm , we combine the prediction model with SHAP analysis , with the latter opening up the black box of a predictive model and analyzes the significance of important features in driving idea implementation . By introducing new important features and verifying their significance in predicting the likelihood of idea implementation , this paper enriched the existing set of antecedents of idea implementation . Fourth , our study constructs and operationalizes the user’s persuasion attempts in detail , expanding the research findings related to PKM . 2 . Background and Related Research 2 . 1 Collaborative Crowdsourcing Community for Open Innovation Innovation is at the core of the knowledge economy and carries enormous social and economic value ( Marjanovic et al . , 2012 ) . Traditional innovation relies on the efforts within a single firm or within a limited number of firms with complementary technologies ( Chesbrough , 2003 ) . Open innovation challenges this traditional concept by encouraging companies to break firm’s operational boundaries and reorganize existing processes like new product development ( Billington & Davidson , 2013 ) . Chesbrough ( 2006 ) defined open innovation as the process by which firms integrate internal and external knowledge to stimulate internal innovation and seek external channels to commercialize products and ideas . The core idea behind open innovation is the crowdsourcing of knowledge , skills , and ideas from the public ( Chesbrough , 2012 ) . Open innovation should become an integrated part of internal R & D rather than a replacement for it , as noted by Chesbrough and Crowther ( 2006 ) . Studies by and Cohen and Levinthal ( 1990 ) indicate that open innovation can enable companies to integrate and utilize external knowledge , technologies , and resources . In the current service economy era , users are regarded as co - creators of value ; the knowledge and technologies they provide have become important strategic resources for firms ( Lusch & Vargo , 2006 ) . With the rapid development of online sharing platforms , companies can gather a wider range of users than ever before through crowdsourcing , which allows them to acquire external knowledge , technologies , and resources at a lower cost ( Brabham , 2009 ) . Crowdsourcing , as defined by Howe ( 2006 ) , is the act of outsourcing a task once performed by an employee to a large , undefined group of people external to the company in the form of an open call . Some crowdsourcing applications are competitive and consist of a 1 one - time contest or multistage tournament ( Terwiesch & Xu , 2008 ) . The competitive crowdsourcing process involves proposing tasks , inviting the public to complete these tasks and submit their results , selecting the winning submissions , and providing the winners with a monetary ( or other ) prize ( Morgan & Wang , 2010 ) . The type of crowdsourcing considered in this paper is referred to as collaborative crowdsourcing . Collaborative crowdsourcing enables users to share their ideas and collaborate with companies to create new—or modify existing—products and services ( Di Gangi & Wasko , 2009 ) . Di Gangi et al . ( 2010 ) suggested that identifying the best ideas is one of the major challenges associated with successfully integrating a crowdsourcing community into a firm’s product - innovation processes . In collaborative crowdsourcing communities , as a wide range of users continues to submit a large number of ideas , firm experts often fall into the idea overload trap ( Jensen et al . , 2014 ; Ma et al . , 2019 ) . Given the limited time and resources , it is difficult for experts to evaluate and identify the promising ideas among many ( Schulze & Hoegl , 2008 ) . Time and resource constraints limit experts’ capacity to absorb such a high volume of ideas ( Blohm et al . , 2011 ) . To make matters worse , the firm’s experts have to spend time evaluating duplicate ideas submitted by new users viewing the site , even if they are similar to existing ideas ( Di Gangi et al . , 2010 ) . In summary , there is an urgent need to establish a new idea - recommendation model for the pre - evaluation of ideas before they reach the firm’s experts ( Blohm et al . , 2011 ) . 2 . 2 Empirical Studies on Idea Implementation In the context of collaborative crowdsourcing for open innovation , user innovation performance is reflected by the implementation or rejection of their ideas . In addition to several case studies ( Di Gangi & Wasko , 2009 ; Schlagwein & Bjørn - Andersen , 2014 ) , empirical studies on idea implementation have been conducted from two perspectives : user - related and idea - related characteristics . From the standpoint of user - 2 related characteristics , previous studies have explored the effects of users’ prior successful ideas , submissions , commenting behavior , tenure , and identity on the likelihood of idea implementation . Examining Dell’s IdeaStorm , Bayus ( 2013 ) found that past success had a negative effect on the implementation of a user’s ideas , while past commenting activity had a positive effect . Li et al . ( 2016 ) suggested that prior participation and implementation rates were positively related to the likelihood of idea implementation in IdeaStorm and Salesforce . com’s IdeaExchange . Schemmann et al . ( 2016 ) found that users who pay major attention to others’ crowdsourced ideas ( and the commenting behavior of users ) positively influence whether or not an idea is implemented by the crowdsourcing company , an internationally active beverage producer and retailer . Hoornaert et al . ( 2017 ) suggested that contributor information ( e . g . , number of past ideas , number of previous contributor comments , number of past implemented ideas , and tenure ) is useful for predicting idea implementation in a crowdsourcing community for an IT product ( Mendeley ) . Examining Salesforce . com’s IdeaExchange community , Yan et al . ( 2018 ) found that ideas contributed to and promoted by employees are more likely to be implemented than those contributed and promoted by product users . Ma et al . ( 2019 ) showed that the prior adoption experience of the innovator positively influenced the adoption of user innovations by the firm in an online game community . Liu et al . ( 2020 ) found an inverted U - shaped relationship between users’ past successful experience and idea implementation . Regarding the second perspective , previous studies have discussed the effects of idea - related characteristics ( e . g . , popularity , presentation , and content ) on the likelihood of implementation . Di Gangi and Wasko ( 2009 ) used the diffusion of innovation theory to propose that the relative advantage of an idea ( e . g . , appropriability , market value , return on investment , development of a new capability ) , the 3 compatibility of the idea with others , and the changes in users’ promotional efforts ( e . g . , votes and comments ) all have a positive effect on an organization’s likelihood of accepting the idea . However , these hypotheses have not been empirically validated . Hossain and Islam ( 2015b ) classified ideas as either “linked” or “sole” in reference to their connection to other ideas . They found that “sole” ideas were more quickly accepted and implemented by organizations than were “linked” ideas . In their study based on message persuasion theory , Li et al . ( 2016 ) concluded that popular ideas are more likely to be adopted and implemented by companies . They also found that idea length , in terms of the number of reference pages and supplementary pictures , was negatively related to the likelihood of implementation . Schemmann et al . ( 2016 ) revealed that an idea’s popularity and its potential innovativeness positively influence whether or not an idea is implemented by the crowdsourcing company . Hoornaert et al . ( 2017 ) indicated that crowd feedback ( e . g . , votes and comments ) and idea content ( e . g . , LSI components and relative distinctiveness ) are the best predictors of idea implementation . Ma et al . ( 2019 ) showed that the popularity , integrity , maintenance , and rareness of the idea positively influence the innovation adopted by the firm . Both the complexity of a user idea and its descriptive images have an inverted , U - shaped relationship with the likelihood of adopting the innovation . Liu et al . ( 2020 ) found that the length of ideas is positively associated with idea implementation ; there is an inverted U - shaped relationship between supporting evidence and idea implementation . To explain idea implementation in the collaborative crowdsourcing community , the previous studies introduced many factors of user - related and idea - related characteristics . However , to analyze the effects of these factors on the likelihood of implementation , the studies focus on the potential theoretical logic of the creative value—that is , they hold that a high - value idea is more likely to be implemented by a 4 firm’s experts ( Bayus , 2013 ; Ma et al . , 2019 ) . The previous theoretical discussion on creative value logic has deepened our understanding of idea implementation from the perspective of the individual users as content creators . On the other hand , however , it has neglected firm experts’ role as the creative recipients who identify and evaluate this content and ultimately decide whether or not to implement an idea . Firm experts not only have professional knowledge , but are also very familiar with the relevant product information , so they can correctly evaluate the value of an idea . However , when there is an enormous number of ideas , firm experts face the challenge of dealing with a massive volume of information . Their identification and evaluation of information as information recipients will also become a key factor that affects decision - making . 3 . Kernel - Theory - Based Design Fundamentally , design science is a problem - solving paradigm that seeks to expand the boundaries of human or organizational capabilities by creating new and innovative artifacts ( Hevner et al . , 2004 ) . Such artifacts are not exempt from natural laws or behavioral theories . Instead , their creation relies on existing kernel theories that are applied and expanded through the researchers’ experience and creativity ( Markus et al . , 2002 ; Walls et al . , 1992 ) . Walls et al . ( 1992 ) define the ISDT as a prescriptive theory that integrates kernel theories into design paths of information systems . There are three main components of ISDTs in the information system design process , including kernel theories , meta - requirements , and meta - design . First , kernel theories come from the natural or social sciences , which govern design meta - requirements . Second , meta - requirements of product design describe the class of goals and problems to which the kernel theory applies . Finally , meta - design represents a class of artifacts hypothesized to meet the meta - requirements . Following three main components of the ISDT , we build a model that predicts the likelihood of idea 5 implementation in a collaborative crowdsourcing community . 3 . 1 Kernel Theory : Persuasion Knowledge Model Fristard and Wright ( 1994 ) proposed the PKM to explain “how people cope with persuasion attempts” ( page 1 ) . PKM describes an interaction process of persuasion , explaining how people’s persuasion knowledge affects their response to persuasion attempts and the persuasion process itself ( Ham et al . 2015 ) . The PKM can be applied to explain the persuasion process from both parties’ perspectives , including those of the agent ( i . e . , message senders ) and the target ( i . e . , message receivers ) . Specifically , the agent tries to choose an appropriate persuasion tactic , and the target attempts to cope with a persuasion attempt ( Friestad & Wright , 1994 ; Ham et al . , 2015 ) ( see Figure 1 ) . Figure 1 . Persuasion Knowledge Model The PKM focuses on how three knowledge structures interact to determine the outcomes of persuasion attempts : persuasion knowledge ( i . e . , how persuasion occurs ) , agent / target knowledge ( i . e . , of the other party ) , and topic knowledge ( i . e . , of the issue or content ) . First , persuasion knowledge refers to 6 how persuasion agents attempt to persuade , including beliefs about marketers’ motives , strategies , and tactics . In essence , persuasion knowledge enables the agent or target to recognize , analyze , interpret , evaluate , and remember persuasion attempts and select and implement coping strategies that are considered useful and appropriate . For the agent , increasing the understanding of persuasion may mean that they choose the persuasion strategy that provides the most relevant information or persuasion possibilities for the target . For the target , more persuasive knowledge may mean that they ignore or refute a misleading statement to best respond to every persuasion event . Second , agent knowledge refers to beliefs about the traits , competencies , and goals of the persuasion agent , such as an advertiser or salesperson . Similarly , target knowledge refers to beliefs about the traits , competencies , and goals of the persuasion target , such as customers . Third , topic knowledge relates to beliefs about the message’s topic , such as a product , service , social cause , or candidate . The PKM has also been applied to a range of persuasion contexts , including retail sales ( Campbell & Kirmani , 2000 ; Hibbert et al . , 2007 ) , advertising and marketing ( Chen et al . , 2019 ; Ham et al . , 2015 ; Hibbert et al . , 2007 ) , product placement ( Wei et al . , 2008 ) , and advergames ( Waiguny et al . , 2014 ) . Although the PKM was developed in a context focused on consumers , it is a general framework that can be applied to any persuasive interaction ( Kirmani & Campbell , 2009 ) . In the following section , we propose a comprehensive set of quantitative metrics to measure agents’ persuasion attempts and targets’ persuasion coping using the PKM in the collaborative crowdsourcing communities that aim for idea implementation . 3 . 2 Meta - Requirements and Meta - Design According to the PKM , we propose that idea implementation is the outcome of dyadic interaction between the persuasion attempts of users and firm experts’ persuasion coping . Specifically , users’ persuasion 7 knowledge is combined with the topic and the target’s knowledge to influence idea generation . Then , firm experts’ persuasion knowledge is combined with the topic and the agent’s knowledge to cope with users’ persuasion attempts . Finally , firm experts decide whether to implement users’ ideas . 3 . 2 . 1 Agents’ Persuasion Attempts The creation and submission of ideas by users is an attempt to persuade firm experts ; these users hope that their ideas will be applied to new products to better meet their needs . According to the PKM , we propose that users’ persuasion knowledge , the target’s knowledge , and topic knowledge jointly affect idea generation and then affect their creative performance . Knowledge is the information or skills that users obtain from past community experiences , which are generally invisible , implicit , and challenging to measure ( Ardichvili et al . , 2006 ) . Therefore , the information that users glean from the community experience becomes an effective way to measure knowledge ( Liu et al . , 2020 ) . Persuasion knowledge . In online communities , users can observe that some ideas have been implemented , while others have not . These ideas , implemented or unimplemented , might become examples of subsequent user - generated ideas . To increase the probability of successful persuasion attempts , users may consciously or unconsciously seek the firm experts’ preferences from these examples ( Hey et al . , 2008 ) . Therefore , we use firm expert preferences ( D1 ) to capture agents’ persuasion knowledge . Then , we use three key variables to operationalize the preferences of firm experts : firm expert preference ( V1 ) , similarity to firm expert preference ( V2 ) , and subtask type ( V3 ) . Target knowledge . Interaction is the leading way for online community members to understand each other ( Jones et al . , 2004 ) . Users obtain information about the firms’ expert groups through online interaction experiences ; these constitute the users’ target knowledge . Thus , we adopt interaction with firm 8 experts ( D2 ) to capture users’ knowledge of the targets . Based on the two dimensions of the breadth and depth of the interaction , we try to answer three questions : 1 ) How many experts did the user interact with ? , 2 ) On how much content does the user interact with the experts ? , and 3 ) What is the valence of the interactive content among them ? Therefore , we use three key variables to operationalize interactions with the firm’s experts : number of firm experts ( V4 ) , number of comments from firm experts ( V5 ) , and comments’ valence ( V6 ) . Topic knowledge is the product - related information obtained by users from past experiences in the community . Users , as external personnel of the company , lack knowledge of product - related information , resulting in the insufficient feasibility of their ideas ( Yan et al . , 2018 ) . The feasibility feedback ( D3 ) that users continuously obtain from the community experience can help them understand the process of new - product development , which constitutes the agents’ topic knowledge related to the product . With an increasing amount of feasibility - related feedback ( V7 ) , users are more likely to propose a new idea by evaluating , managing , or lowering the potential risks or mistakes that can be made when the company implements an idea ( Liu et al . , 2016 ) . 3 . 2 . 2 Targets’ Persuasion Coping Firm experts decide whether to implement an idea by coping with the users’ persuasion attempts . If they are persuaded , they will implement the idea , and vice versa . Based on the PKM , we argue that firm experts’ persuasion knowledge , agent knowledge , and topic knowledge jointly influence their decisions to implement ideas . Ideas are the primary carriers of the dyadic interaction between firm experts and users . In other words , ideas are the result of users constructing persuasion attempts , and they are a path for firm experts to identify and cope with users’ persuasion attempts . Thus , we leverage information obtained by 9 firm experts from user ideas to effectively measure the three types of knowledge . Persuasion knowledge . In the context of a collaborative crowdsourcing community , firms’ experts acquire persuasion knowledge by thinking critically about the quality of the arguments presented in favor of user ideas ( Sussman & Siegal , 2003 ) . We propose that high - quality ideas are more likely to meet experts’ needs and catch their attention than are their lower - quality counterparts ( Shi et al . , 2018 ) . To conceptualize the concept of idea quality , we not only emphasize the importance of idea content ( D4 ) but also consider the influence of the idea presentation ( D5 ) ( Li et al . , 2016 ) on the decision by firm experts to implement the idea ( or not ) . Firm experts evaluate user - generated ideas by not only what the idea expresses but also how users communicate it ( Ng & Bradac , 1993 ) . Following previous research ( Franke et al . , 2006 ) , we use three key variables to conceptualize the “what” : novelty ( V8 ) , customer benefit ( V9 ) , and feasibility ( V10 ) . We conceptualize the “how” using three other variables : topic - focused ( V11 ) , emotion ( V12 ) , and abstractness ( V13 ) . In addition , attractive idea presentation increases the potential for attitude changes of the firm’s experts , which may affect the effectiveness of their persuasive efforts ( Mowen et al . , 1987 ) . Following previous research ( Liu et al . , 2020 ; Li et al . , 2016 ) , we use two key variables to conceptualize idea presentation : idea length ( V14 ) and supporting evidence ( V15 ) . Agent knowledge . This comes from the authenticity , credibility , and integrity of the source of user ideas as perceived by firm experts ( Cacioppo & Goldman , 1981 ) . General agreement seems to exist over the dimensions of source credibility , which are expertise and trustworthiness ( Hyan Yoo & Gretzel , 2008 ; Pornpitakpan , 2004 ; Tseng & Fogg , 1999 ) . Expertise refers to the degree to which the experts believe that the user , as a source , is capable of devising accurate and valuable ideas ( Homer & Kahle , 1990 ) . Since user 10 knowledge in online virtual communities is intangible and often tacit , we use the past experience of users as its proxy . Trustworthiness describes the believability of the user as a source ( Mowen et al . , 1987 ) , which is the most influential dimension in determining a source’s credibility ( Berlo et al . , 1969 ) . We also introduce individual traits , such as mood state , as the third dimension of agent knowledge based on the PKM . Following the above discussion , we adopt three dimensions to capture the targets’ knowledge of agents : past experience ( D6 ) , trustworthiness ( D7 ) , and mood state ( D8 ) . According to the theory of persuasion , the past participation experience of ideators can change firm experts’ attitudes , thus affecting the likelihood of idea implementation ( Petty & Cacioppo , 1986 ; Bhattacherjee , 2006 ) . In the open innovation literature , the past experience of users is an essential factor influencing the implementation of ideas ( Bayus , 2013 ; Li et al . , 2016 ; Schemmann et al . , 2016 ; Hoornaert et al . , 2017 ; Yan et al . , 2018 ; Ma et al . , 2019 ; Liu et al . , 2020 ) . Following previous research , we use five key variables to conceptualize past experience : submission experience ( V16 ) , implementation experience ( V17 ) , diversity experience ( V18 ) , same - day experience ( V19 ) , and tenure in community ( V20 ) . Previous studies on social network structure have used centrality to measure the trustworthiness of each actor ( Liu et al . , 2012 ) . There are two options for how to capture centrality : out - degree and in - degree ( Lowry et al . , 2014 ) . For example , Liu et al . ( 2020 ) found that centrality can be used as a trustworthiness dimension for predicting information usefulness in online knowledge communities . We adopt two key variables to conceptualize trustworthiness : comments sent ( V21 ) and comments received ( V22 ) . According to mood - as - information theory , moods state ( V23 ) in the stream of affective experience can promote creativity in a supportive context ( Schwarz & Clore , 1983 ) . Positive mood states cause individuals to show divergent thinking , fluid ideation , flexible categorization , the ability to build unusual 11 word associations , inspired insights , and broadened thought - action , thereby enhancing creative performance ( Kaufmann , 2003 ) . Negative mood states indicate a problem state and prompt us to exert a high level of effort to learn about and solve the problem ( Schwarz , 2002 ) . Topic knowledge . Generally speaking , firm experts have the dual identities of internal employees and industry experts and are proficient in product - related topic knowledge . However , in developing new products , it is difficult for firm experts to estimate the market value , such as popularity , of new ideas ( Lüthje et al . , 2005 ; Morrison et al . , 2000 ) . Firm - hosted crowdsourcing communities establish the pre - evaluation mechanisms used to solicit feedback from potential customers on the popularity of ideas ( Di Gangi et al . , 2010 ; Schemmann et al . , 2016 ) . Hence , we use popularity ( D9 ) to capture the targets’ topic knowledge . Popularity indicators can reveal the concerns and priorities of other users , which helps firms gain insight into the needs and desires of their customers . Popularity ( V24 ) as an early indicator of future market trends may help firms develop more commercially attractive products and services that meet or exceed user needs ; thus , it can provide a significant advantage in market competition ( Lüthje et al . , 2005 ; Morrison et al . , 2000 ) . Table 1 is the PKM - based prediction model for the likelihood of idea implementation , which summarizes the quantitative metrics ( measure variables ) for all the computable dimensions and variables in our study . In addition , Appendix I details Meta - Design and discusses the relationship between variables and idea implementation likelihood . And Appendix II details the operationalization of idea implementation and measure variables . 12 Table 1 .

Design Instantiation : An Idea Implementation Prediction Model We now introduce the design process—the architecture of our proposed system . The goal of this system is to design a well - performing framework to predict the likelihood of idea implementation . As shown in Figure 2 , the proposed framework consists of three parts : data collection , feature extraction , and model construction . Figure 2 . System Architecture of a PKM - based Prediction Model First , we developed a web page scraper to collect the necessary information , such as the information in idea threads , from the targeted online open innovation community . Then , the crawled HTML documents were parsed by the Python library beautifulsoup4 , and we extracted idea content , user information , firm expert’s response , comments from other users , and other information . We stored this information in a relational database and ignored the HTML tags and other metadata of the web pages . In particular , firm experts’ responses ( e . g . , to adopt an idea or not ) are the outcome of each idea ; the other characteristics of each idea are used as the indicators for predicting that idea’s outcome . Finally , the data tuples ( idea information , idea outcome ) were employed as the data instances for training the idea implementation 16 prediction model . Second , we extracted the features from the idea information . Specifically , we applied topic modeling , text similarity , linguistic inquiry , and expertise profiling techniques to generate the variables , such as originality , topic dispersion , abstractness , firm expert preference , ideator expertise , and others , from the unstructured textual idea content . Finally , we converted each idea into a tuple ( x i , y i ) , where x i is a feature vector extracted from idea - related information , and y i is the outcome of each idea . Third , we trained and tested the idea implementation prediction model . In detail , the tuple set { ( x i , y i ) , i Î N , where N is the set of all ideators } was randomly selected and split into the training set and testing set . Then , we adopted six classic supervised learning algorithms , including Adaboost , logistic regression , Support Vector Machine ( SVM ) , random forest , convolutional neural network ( CNN ) , and XGBoost 1 , for training the proposed model . Based on the training data set , each learning algorithm was used to fit the objective function and generate the idea implementation prediction model . Finally , the trained prediction model was assessed and evaluated using the test data set . 5 . Design Evaluation Setting 5 . 1 Evaluation Data To show the validity and quality of our proposed model , we collected data from Xiaomi’s MIUI new function discussion ( MIUI NFD ) forum , which is a prominent firm - hosted open innovation community in China . The MIUI NFD forum was established and is operated by Beijing Xiaomi Technology Inc . ( Xiaomi ) . By the third quarter of 2020 , Xiaomi was reported to have become the world’s third - largest smartphone 1 We applied the python packages keras to implementing CNN and scikit - learn to implementing Adaboost , logistic regression , SVM , random forest , and XGBoost . 17 manufacturer , 2 after Samsung and Huawei . The MIUI NFD forum invites users to submit ideas for optimizing or adding functions to the operating system of MIUI mobile phones . The effective integration of users’ ideas and Xiaomi’s internal resources boost the iterative innovation of the MIUI mobile phone operating system , allowing for constant innovation and creation of products that meet multiple user needs and that are in line with user habits . We collected all idea threads from the MIUI NFD forum , from August 2010 to December 2015 . During this period , users submitted 110 , 384 ideas to the forum . We preprocessed the ideas by deleting special posts , including 515 posts released by the MIUI Official Team , moderators , or the MIUI Designer Team ; 578 posts that did not list a submission time ; 217 summary posts ; and 3 posts with missing information . In addition , we deleted 19 , 165 posts without an idea description . After preprocessing , 89 , 906 ideas remained . The summary statistics for our data are shown in Table 2 . Table 2 . Summary statistics of the MIUI NFD forum Data set MIUI NFD forum No . of ideas 89 , 906 No . of ideators 53 , 885 No . of users 201 , 655 Average no . of replies per idea 7 . 78 No . of words in data set 13 , 366 , 946 5 . 2 Evaluation Setup As shown in Figure 3 , we designed two tasks for predicting idea implementation . In the first task , we only used the data for ideas posted before 2015 to train and test the prediction models . It is noted that the data are highly imbalanced in terms of the number of implemented and unimplemented ideas ( 4 , 388 and 53 , 211 2 See https : / / www . counterpointresearch . com / global - smartphone - share / . 18 ideas , respectively ) because most ideas fail to earn a positive response from firm experts . Japkowicz and Stephen ( 2002 ) claim that data skewness in a training set , especially high skewness , can lead to bad performance of prediction or classification . To alleviate the negative effect of data imbalance , we applied an under sampling strategy 3 to reduce instances of the majority class to make the data balanced . Specifically , we randomly selected ten samples , each of which included 4 , 000 implemented ideas ( positive instance ) and 4 , 000 unimplemented ideas ( negative instance ) . For each sample , we employed a ten - fold cross - validation technique to train and test the baseline model and our proposed model . However , this setting does not consider the potential effect of ideas’ posted time . In the real world , we are not able to use later ideas ( in the training set ) to predict the outcomes of earlier ideas ( in the testing set ) . In addition , the prediction performance of the supervised learning methods might be overestimated because later ideas ( in the training set ) can provide extra information , in hindsight , to implementation predictions . To address the hindsight issue in Task 1 , we developed the second task in which the training and testing sets were strictly divided by a specific date : January 1 , 2015 . Table III in Appendix II shows that 57 , 577 ideas were posted before 2015 ( 4 , 366 implemented ideas and 53 , 211 unimplemented ideas ) , and 32 , 329 ideas ( 1 , 852 implemented ideas and 30 , 477 unimplemented ideas ) were posted during 2015 . Similarly , we applied the under sampling technique to randomly generate ten data samples for the training set , where each sample consisted of 4 , 000 implemented and 4 , 000 unimplemented instances . Different from Task 1 , we generated two types of testing sets , namely , balanced and unbalanced . In the balanced set , we 3 Other strategies exist to reduce the impact of data skewness , such as oversampling , synthetic sampling , and cost sensitivity learning . However , sampling strategies are not our main focus , so we do not apply each of them in this study . 19 randomly selected ten testing samples , each of which contained 1 , 852 positive and 1 , 852 negative instances . In the unbalanced set , we maintained the original data distribution that reflects the real - world scenarios ( Batista et al . , 2004 ) . Figure 3 . Evaluation setup Based on the setting , we conducted some experiments to confirm the efficacy and quality of our proposed model . To mathematically evaluate the performance of the baseline model and our proposed model , we adopted five commonly used metrics for information retrieval : accuracy , precision , recall , f - measure , and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ( AUC ) . Following Liu et al . ’s work ( 2020 ) , all method performance results are presented in the evaluation results section using these five metrics : ! " " # $ ! " % = !

Design Evaluation Results 6 . 1 The PKM - Based Model vs . the Baseline To demonstrate the advantages of our proposed model , we constructed the baseline and proposed models with some variations using Python . First , we repeated the work of Hoornaert et al . ( 2017 ) and built the “3Cs” model as the baseline model . Then , we built incremental models ( e . g . , baseline + target and baseline + agent ) by adding each part of our PKM - based prediction model to identify the contribution of each part in the PKM for idea implementation prediction . Finally , we ran the full proposed model ( baseline + target + agent ) . Following the evaluation setting , the performance results of Task 1 are shown in Table 3 , in which the accuracy , precision , recall , f - measure , and AUC are reported . The paired t - test results demonstrate that our model outperformed the baseline model in all supervised learning algorithms , and each independent part ( e . g . , target and agent ) based on the PKM is critical to improving the performance of idea implementation prediction . Particularly , XGBoost performed best in all five metrics , and our model using XGBoost significantly outperformed the baseline model in all five metrics by 11 . 9 % , 15 . 1 % , 13 . 4 % , 13 . 5 % , and 15 . 9 % , respectively . To reduce the impact of the hindsight issue in Task 1 , we followed the evaluation setting to execute 21 Task 2 . Based on the performance in Task 1 , we applied XGBoost to the baseline and proposed models in Task 2 . The results in Table 4 again show that our proposed model performed significantly better than the baseline model . For balanced testing of the data set , our model easily defeated the baseline model without any surprises , although its performance decreased a bit compared to its performance in Task 1 . For unbalanced testing of the data set , the advantage of our model remained . Meanwhile , the target and agent components can also provide significant contributions to predicting idea implementation in both scenarios . Surprisingly , the deep - learning method , CNN , failed to deliver the best performance in both Task 1 and Task 2 . The poor performance of CNN might be caused by the small training set that leads to overfitting in the training process . Taken together , the results support all three testable hypotheses listed in Section 3 . Specifically , the results in Tables 3 and 4 indicate that the model considering agents’ persuasion attempts and the model considering targets’ persuasion coping perform better than the “3Cs” model for predicting the likelihood of idea implementation . Those performance results also demonstrate the efficacy and quality of our PKM - based idea implementation prediction model . 22 Table 3 .

Prior research ( Rai , 2020 ) points out the importance of interpretability for machine - learning methods . According to Rai’s argument , interpretability can contribute from two perspectives : theoretical explanations of the model ( i . e . , helping us identify comprehensive and meaningful features ) and technical explanations of a prediction ( i . e . , providing technical explanations for a specific prediction ) . To better understand the efficacy of the PKM - based model and open the black box of machine - learning methods , we adopted the SHAP module to analyze and illustrate our proposed model . The goal of SHAP is to explain the prediction of an instance x by computing the contribution of each feature to the prediction . It is always used to calculate the SHAP value , which is defined as the expected marginal contribution over all possible coalitions ( Shapley , 1953 ) . This module can generate some figures to show the theoretical and technical explanations for a given prediction or classification model . As discussed in Section 3 , our proposed model is driven and guided by the PKM . Based on the PKM , we suggested 34 variables derived from the two critical components ( e . g . , target and agent ) , and we applied some computing techniques to quantify these variables . However , due to the limited transparency of machine - learning methods , we failed to observe the importance of the proposed features . Fortunately , SHAP can alleviate the negative effects of this issue . Figure 4 lists the top 20 features in terms of SHAP values , which means that these features are the 20 most important features for idea implementation prediction . It is noted that only six are from the baseline model ( “3Cs” model ) , and the other 14 were introduced in this study for the first time ; thus , our proposed features have more impact on prediction output . This result tells us that these newly proposed features play great roles in idea implementation prediction . 26 In addition , the SHAP summary plots on the right side of Figure 4 display the real impact of each variable on predicting an idea’s outcome . For example , first , we found that a positive label for firm expert preference and similarity to a positive label for firm expert preference positively affects the likelihood of idea implementation . However , a negative label for firm expert preference and similarity to a negative label for firm expert preference was found to have detrimental effects on an idea’s implementation probability . In other words , new ideas that are more similar to implemented ideas are more likely to be adopted and implemented by firms’ experts . Conversely , new ideas that are more similar to unimplemented ideas are less likely to be implemented . Second , the plots show that same - day submission , implementation experience , diversity experience , and tenure positively affect an idea’s implementation . However , the submission experience negatively affects idea implementation . Third , more popular ( views , comments , and votes ) , concrete , and topic dispersion - focused ideas are more likely to be adopted and implemented by a firm’s experts . However , novelty negatively affected idea implementation . Finally , we found that the number of firm experts has positive effects on idea implementation . However , the number of comments received has adverse effects on idea implementation . SHAP can also provide technical explanations for a specific prediction . Taking Figure 5 as an example , given an idea , the outcome of which is “implemented , ” the baseline model predicts it as “unimplemented , ” but our proposed model classifies it correctly as “implemented . ” In this figure , the variables in red contribute to the “implemented” prediction , whereas the variables in blue contribute to the “unimplemented” prediction . Comparing the two plots above , we find that the proposed model has more variables in red , pushing the model to make an “implemented” prediction . This means that the newly added variables indeed provide more predictive power and improve the performance of the prediction model . 27 Figure 4 . Top 20 features in terms of SHAP values Note . The features in the red rectangles are included in “3Cs” model proposed by Hoornaert et al . ( 2017 ) . Figure 5 . An example of idea implementation prediction 6 . 3 Feature Selection and a Quasi - Optimal Subset of Features Feature selection always plays a critical role in machine learning , and it hugely impacts the performance of prediction and classification tasks . The data features used to train machine - learning models directly 28 influence the performance that we can achieve . To optimize model performance , feature selection analysis is needed ; this is the process of automatically or manually selecting the features that contribute most to the prediction models from the whole feature set . In this section , we perform feature selection analysis to find the “optimal” subset of all features to construct the best prediction model . A previous study ( Chandrashekar & Sahin , 2014 ) pointed out that finding the globally optimal solution for feature selection is impossible because it is an NP - hard problem , and the search procedure needs almost an infinite amount of time when the feature number is large . For this reason , the goal of our study is not to solve this NP - hard problem , but to find a quasi - optimal feature subset that can help further improve the performance of the idea implementation prediction . We adopt a filter - type feature selection algorithm to rank all features ( 34 features from the PKM - based model , control variables , and other features from the baseline “3Cs” model ) by SHAP values . All features are placed in descending order in terms of the SHAP values , and every five features are sequentially added into the model at one step . After 15 filtering steps , we find a quasi - optimal feature subset ( the top 25 features in terms of SHAP values ) . Table 5 shows the performance of our proposed model using difference feature sets . We find that our proposed model , using the quasi - optimal feature set , succeeds in delivering better performance than when all features are used . Table 5 .

Discussion and Conclusions In the era of the service economy , a growing number of consumers tends to actively express their views on products to influence the direction of new product development ( Lusch & Vargo , 2006 ) . The explosion of ideas makes it challenging for firm experts to screen and identify ideas with potential implementation possibilities . Therefore , it is necessary to develop more effective automatic idea - screening tools to assist firm experts in identifying high - potential ideas efficiently . In this study , we propose a theory - driven analysis framework that can automatically extract important features and predict which ideas have more potential for implementation . We conducted a series of rigorous and robust tests using MIUI community data to evaluate the performance of our predictive model . The results show that our predictive model has superior efficacy compared to the baseline model ( “3Cs” ) . 7 . 1 Implications for Research Our study introduces a comprehensive set of features based on the theory of the PKM to construct an analysis framework to predict the likelihood of idea implementation , which can effectively address the idea evaluation overload problem in open innovation . Hoornaert et al . ( 2017 ) identified a few important features and established a learning algorithm based on those features to indicate the likelihood of idea implementation within collaborative open innovation communities . However , they did not develop their model based on a holistic theory and approach . Our research follows the design science research paradigm ISDT and the PKM to construct a multilevel analytical framework of idea implementation . Our framework builds a comprehensive and concise feature set by introducing existing features and proposing important new features . Our framework provides a solid foundation for future applications that aim to extract admissible information from online communities . 30 Based on the PKM , our study introduces a new theoretical logic—a dyadic interaction process of persuasion—to explain idea implementation . Previous research generally uses the theoretical logic of individual creativity from an idea generator to explain idea implementation ( e . g . , Bayus , 2013 ; Schemmann et al . , 2016 ; Ma et al . , 2019 ) , ignoring the information processing by firm experts as information recipients and its effects on their idea - implementation decisions . Our study operationalizes idea implementation as the outcome of the dyadic persuasion process ; that is , the user tries to choose an appropriate persuasion attempt , and the firm expert carries out persuasion coping before deciding whether to implement the idea or not . Persuasion logic advocated by the PKM is a supplement to individual creation logic . It comprehensively explains creative implementation from the perspective of both the information generator and processor . Persuasion logic deepens our understanding of user - generated ideas and firm experts’ selection of ideas in a collaborative open innovation community . Based on the theory - driven design paradigm , our study introduces SHAP analysis to further increase the prediction model’s interpretability . Applying natural or social science theory to guide the design process is challenging . Our study illustrates a detailed approach to using the PKM in the design of information adoption analysis systems . According to the PKM , we discuss how to derive computational features from the conceptual dimension to predict idea implementation likelihood and demonstrate that our theory - driven design can significantly outperform other intuitively driven methods . The application of kernel theory not only provides theoretical guidance for framework design but also arouses researchers’ curiosity to explore the relationship between important features and prediction problems . However , the prediction model is generally considered a black - box model , losing the interpretability of the linear model . By introducing SHAP analysis , we discuss the direct and interactive effects between important features and 31 idea implementation , which makes up for the limitation of the lack of interpretability of the prediction model . Our study can enlighten future research on information system design and adopt the research paradigm of “theory - driven design and SHAP analysis” to achieve the dual goal of prediction and interpretation . Our study also offers some interesting extension for the PKM framework . Previous studies applied the PKM to a wide range of persuasion scenarios , such as retail sales , advertising , and marketing . Although the PKM emphasizes the dyadic interaction of persuasion , previous studies mainly focused on the target’s persuasion coping while ignoring the agent’s persuasion attempt ( Chen & Cheng , 2019 ; Nelson et al . , 2004 ) . Our study fills this application gap and provides operational examples for the complete application of the PKM . Also , the results of the SHAP analysis show that the top 20 important features are distributed in the three knowledge dimensions of agent and target : persuasion knowledge , agent / target knowledge , and topic knowledge . Our conclusion provides empirical support for the importance of the three types of knowledge proposed in the PKM . Finally , we further find that there are interaction effects between the top six important features , which involve interactions between two types of knowledge and two variables of a specific kind of knowledge . Our conclusions extend the PKM and inspire the exploration of possible interaction effects in future studies . Finally , our framework contributes to the open innovation literature by introducing new important features to predict and explain the likelihood of idea implementation . Prior literature has primarily focused on user - related and idea - related perspectives ( Bayus , 2013 ; Hoornaert et al . , 2017 ; Li et al . , 2016 ; Ma et al . , 2019 ; Schemmann et al . , 2016 ; Yan et al . , 2018 ) , which may be insufficient to fully explain the likelihood of idea implementation . According to the PKM , we proposed nine new features under four new conceptual 32 dimensions : D1 : firm expert preference ( positive / negative label for firm expert preference , similarity to positive / negative label for firm expert preference ) ; D3 : feasibility feedback ( feasibility - related feedback ) ; D4 : idea content ( customer benefit , feasibility , and topic dispersion ) ; and D8 : mood state ( positive / negative ) . The results of the SHAP analysis show that our new features are distributed in the top 20 important variables list . These new features enrich the existing antecedents of idea implementation in the context of the collaborative crowdsourcing community . 7 . 2 Implications for Practice An important practical implication of our study is to allow companies that utilize collaborative open innovation to improve upon their external resource - acquisition processes and establish a system that can more effectively serve firm experts to screen and evaluate ideas . Idea selection and evaluation generally rely on enterprises investing significant human resources to complete these tasks manually . Experts representing companies need to spend a lot of time and energy dealing with large amounts of low - quality or repetitive information . Although companies have introduced topic classification and crowd - based evaluation systems , these two methods have their limitations , as mentioned earlier . We use machine - learning technology to automatically identify ideas with potential for implementation , which is an effective way to solve the challenges of idea screening and evaluation . Our framework has been rigorously evaluated and has shown excellent capabilities , providing practical guidance for companies on building a machine - learning - based idea screening and evaluation system . Another practical application of the agent model is to assist companies in the management of user resources and to establish a system that can automatically identify users with creative potential . Attracting , cultivating , and guiding users to participate in creative tasks is the key to the success of an enterprise - led 33 collaborative innovation community . To effectively implement user management strategies , companies need to understand and analyze user characteristics in real time . However , due to the anonymity of virtual communities and the concealment of personal knowledge , it is difficult for companies to grasp the knowledge structure of users this rapidly . According to the PKM , our agent model provides a potential solution for an operational user knowledge framework . The agent model demonstrated excellent performance in predicting the probability of creative implementation , and it reflected the creative potential of users to a large extent . Our agent model is a potential solution for companies interested in building user - recognition systems based on machine learning and new ideas for future system developers . Our framework can also be applied to the R & D of other content - recommendation systems , such as the question - recommendation system for online Q & A communities . Online Q & A is gradually becoming a mainstream way to help people discover any information at any time . This requires the recommendation system to accurately push the real - time questions to potential answerers to achieve a higher response rate and content quality . The precise matching of questions and answers is one of the most challenging tasks in existence . Our framework provides another perspective to improve the accuracy of the question - recommendation system , through which a predictive model of the user’s answer probability can be established . Future system developers can use our framework and historical data to construct an answer probability index and incorporate it into the existing question - recommendation system . Our conclusions from the SHAP analysis , the top five important features , and their correlation with idea implementation provide practical suggestions for companies to set up collaborative open innovation management strategies . For example , we recommend that companies continue to refine the classification management of ideas . A feasible solution is to add the topic classification of idea content based on the 34 existing product function classification . More detailed classification management helps the gathering of similar peers and provides more possibilities for idea explosion . We recommend that companies show users the implemented ideas as positive examples and appropriately hide unimplemented ideas to avoid negative examples . On the one hand , showing positive examples helps to properly regulate and guide the idea - generation process of users ; on the other hand , hiding negative examples may help avoid the cognitive fixation effect they cause . Also , we recommend that companies encourage users to “speak freely” and welcome the submission strategy of “volume wins . ” 7 . 3 Limitations and Future Work There are several limitations of this study that merits discussion , which opens up opportunities for future research . First , our research did not consider the unobservable group decision - making process of firm experts , which may be an important factor affecting the implementation of ideas . Future research can focus on group decision - making by firm experts and explore the causes and consequences . Second , machine - learning algorithms , especially deep - learning algorithms , have been broadly used to help business decision - making . However , those algorithms suffer from low interpretability . Although this study proposes the research paradigm of “theory - driven design and SHAP analysis” for both prediction and interpretation , further interpretation of machine - learning algorithms is warranted . Future data science research is therefore needed to further the interpretable approach for machine learning prediction models . Another interesting future research is the balance between efficiency and diversity of users’ ideas in the long run . The idea recommendation model potentially limits the preferences of firm experts to the existing interests . Future research can further explore decision - making power allocation between idea recommendation tools and firm experts and explore feasible measures to enhance both the efficiency and diversity of ideas . 35 References Ardichvili , A . , Maurer , M . , Li , W . , Wentling , T . , & Stuedemann , R .

Meta - Design Table I . The relationship between variables and idea implementation Variables in PKM - based prediction model Idea implementation V1 : Firm expert preference The implemented ideas represent a positive preference—that is , the kinds of ideas that firm experts tend to implement . Meanwhile , unimplemented ideas represent a negative preference—that is , the kinds of ideas that firm experts tend not to implement . According to the new product design literature , implemented ideas—as examples of successful proposals—may stimulate creativity ( Helms et al . , 2009 ) or trigger a cognitive fixation ( Chan et al . , 2011 ) , thus positively or negatively affecting users’ subsequent ideation . Although unimplemented ideas are examples of failures , users may still unconsciously copy elements with apparent defects and affect the development of their subsequent creative ideas ( Charysikou & Weisberg , 2005 ) . V2 : Similarity to firm expert preference The positive label indicates that users are striving to cater to the idea implementation preferences of firm experts . In contrast , a negative label implies that users are more affected by negative examples and unconsciously deviate from the idea implementation preferences of firm experts . Therefore , whether an idea is given a positive or negative label , it will affect the idea implementation decision of the firm experts ( Liu et al . , 2020 ) . V3 : Sub - task type Furthermore , implemented and unimplemented ideas under the subtask type more precisely represent the preference of the firm’s experts responsible for this subtask type . Generally speaking , the firm’s experts are responsible for different subtasks , so the priorities for idea implementation under different subtasks are varied ( Bayus , 2013 ; Li et al . , 2016 ) . To control for differences in implementation preferences , we add the subtask type of an idea to the prediction model . V4 : Number of firm experts The more experts with whom the user has interacted , the more comprehensively and accurately the user understands the characteristics of the expert group . Based on this , we propose that number of experts affects the process of user creation of ideas and ii the likelihood of idea implementation . V5 : Number of comments from firm experts More comment content generally contains richer information ( Wang et al . , 2014 ) , which helps users deepen their understanding of the characteristics of the expert group . Therefore , we believe that the amount of interactive content with the firm’s experts affects the user’s tendency to generate ideas , which affects the likelihood of idea implementation . V6 : Comments’ valence Positive or negative comment content shows , on the one hand , the evaluation of each idea by the firm’s experts ( Zhou , 1998 ) . On the other hand , it demonstrates the emotional state of the interaction between the firm’s experts and the user ( Liu et al . , 2020 ) . Users acquire knowledge about the firm’s experts from positive or negative comments , which helps them make strategic choices in persuasive attempts . V7 : Feasibility - related feedback With an increasing amount of feasibility - related feedback , users are more likely to propose a new idea by evaluating , managing , or lowering the potential risks or mistakes that can be made when the company implements an idea ( Liu et al . , 2016 ) . V8 : Novelty Idea novelty plays an essential role in new product development ( Dahl & Moreau , 2002 ) . Thus , novel ideas that experts have never encountered are more likely to attract their attention and , therefore , have a greater likelihood of being implemented . Previous studies found that an expert’s decision regarding idea implementation is affected by an idea’s novelty ( Hoornaert et al . , 2017 ) . V9 : Customer benefit It is necessary to put effort into intensively developing a small core of carefully selected projects with higher customer benefits to create maximum business value and profit ( Kirschbaum , 2005 ) . Ideas with customer - benefit - related content are more likely to attract the interest of the firm’s experts and persuade them to implement them . Di Gangi ( 2009 ) proposes that market value and return on investment are two critical dimensions of an idea’s relative advantage , which affects the likelihood of idea implementation V10 : Feasibility Feasibility is one of the top concerns for a firm’s experts when they initiate any attempt to judge risk and implement innovative ideas ( Fan et al . , 2012 ; Ramachandran & Gopal , 2010 ) . A firm’s experts can improve the probability of success of new products by identifying and managing potential risks of creative implementation ( Turner et al . , 2012 ) . Ideas that have passed a feasibility analysis are more in line with the needs of the firm’s experts . Therefore , they are more likely to be adopted and implemented . V11 : Topic dispersion Although proposals may be of similar length ( e . g . , word count ) , some proposals address multiple dimensions of innovation ( we call these “balanced” ideas ) , whereas other proposals focus on fewer dimensions ( we call these “focused” ideas ; Li et al . , 2016 ) . For example , an idea for a mobile phone design with high topic dispersion might involve discrete elements , such as appearance , sound quality , and browser speed , while an idea with low topic dispersion may only provide in - depth suggestions for improving the appearance of the phone . Although narrower , ideas with low topic dispersion tend to be valued more highly , as they provide deeper information on a iii specific product dimension . In a collaborative crowdsourcing community , firm experts have professional knowledge about a product , and they , therefore , may prefer more specific ideas that provide a deeper perspective about one dimension , or a select few dimensions , of the product ( Filieri , 2015 ) . Compared to balanced ideas , focused ideas tend to be perceived by experts as having higher value for adoption and implementation . V12 : Emotion Emotional expressions in user - generated ideas are likely to come from the user’s positive or negative experiences using the product . These experiences cause users to apply positive or negative words to express their ideas and describe their emotional experiences in the process of writing up an idea ( Huang , 2012 ) . In the collaborative crowdsourcing community , the firm’s experts can identify users’ needs through the emotional expression of their idea content . In particular , negative emotional expressions reflect unmet user needs , which will likely inform the development direction of product renewal . Prior studies have acknowledged the importance of capturing the emotions expressed in online opinions , such as product reviews . We believe that the expression of users’ positive or negative emotions is conducive to strengthening the credibility of ideas and improving idea implementation . V13 : Abstractness The Linguistic Category Model identifies four levels of linguistic abstractness that people use to describe single events ( Maass et al . , 1989 ) . The most concrete level corresponds to descriptive action verbs , which refer to observable behaviors with a definite beginning and end . Next are interpretive action verbs , which describe and interpret actions . The third level consists of state verbs , which refer to the unobservable psychological states of actors . Finally , the most abstract level corresponds to adjectives , which allow people to generalize behaviors at the trait level ( Semin & Fiedler , 1988 , 1991 ) . Previous studies have examined a possible concreteness effect , which suggests that concrete information has a stronger impact on judgments and decision - making than does abstract information ( Larrimore et al . , 2011 ) . In the collaborative crowdsourcing community , a concrete idea includes more details and specifics about context , actions , objects , and outcomes ; it is also more vivid and thereby attracts more attention from the firm’s experts ( MacKenzie , 1986 ) . V14 : Idea length In the persuasion literature , higher information length weakens its quality ( Huhmann et al . , 2002 ) . Li et al . ( 2016 ) proposed that a longer idea contains complex content and structure , which triggers information overload effects . They found that idea length is negatively related to the likelihood of idea implementation . However , Liu et al . ( 2020 ) adopt idea length to explore the effects of user engagement in the process of idea generation . They suggested that idea length positively correlates with the likelihood of idea implementation . V15 : Supporting evidence Li et al . ( 2016 ) suggested that the effects of supporting evidence on idea implementation likelihood are optimal at medium levels of supporting evidence ( not more than one reference page or two supplementary images in Salesforce . com IdeaExchange ) . From the perspective of process engagement , Liu ( 2020 ) proposed iv that ideas with an appropriate amount of supporting evidence ( standardized value reaches 1 . 25 ) are more likely to be implemented by a firm’s experts . V16 : Submission experience Hossain and Islam ( 2015a , 2015b ) and Hoornaert et al . ( 2017 ) found that the number of past ideas has a positive relationship with idea implementation . V17 : Implementation experience Previous research explored users’ past implementation experience on the likelihood of idea implementation and offered different views . Bayus ( 2013 ) found that past success experience is negatively related to idea implementation . However , Hoornaert et al . ( 2017 ) and Ma et al . ( 2019 ) suggested that the number of ideas implemented in the past has a positive relationship with idea implementation . Moreover , Liu et al . ( 2020 ) proposed an inverted , U - shaped relationship between past implementation experience and the likelihood of implementation . V18 : Diversity experience Compared with those who do not participate in creative tasks or those who engage in one or a few types of tasks , users who are involved in different creative tasks have accumulated more information and knowledge for the development of attractive ideas ( Jeppesen & Lakhani , 2010 ) . Therefore , the diversity of user experience affects the idea implementation decisions of the firm’s experts . Bayus ( 2013 ) found that an individual’s likelihood of proposing an idea that is later implemented is related to the diversity of their past idea and past commenting activity . Jensen et al . ( 2014 ) suggested an inverted , U - shaped relationship between the variety of design activities and the likelihood of commercially attractive design . V19 : Same day submission Hossain and Islam ( 2015a , 2015b ) and Liu et al . ( 2020 ) suggested that same - day submission experience positive affects the likelihood of idea implementation . V20 : Tenure Li et al . ( 2016 ) and Hoornaert et al . ( 2017 ) found that tenure has a positive relationship with idea implementation . V21 : Comments sent Users’ active comments on others’ ideas strengthen the interaction with other community members . As a result , a user’s past commenting behavior is an essential factor for their reputation in the community ( He & Wei , 2009 ; Wasko & Faraj , 2005 ) . Prior research on the open innovation community found that the number of previous user comments has a positive relationship with idea implementation ( Bayus , 2013 ; Li et al . , 2016 ; Schemmann et al . , 2016 ; Hoornaert et al . , 2017 ) . V22 : Comments received Receiving more comments illustrates a user’s popularity among community members ( Di Gangi & Wasko , 2009 ) ; it can also represent that the user has acquired relevant and diverse knowledge in their interactions with community members ( Kohn & Smith , 2011 ) . Therefore , we believe that a larger number of comments received increases the probability of the firm’s experts adopting a user’s ideas by enhancing the trustworthiness of their information sources . V23 : Mood state In the collaborative crowdsourcing community , users interact and communicate through comments , showing positive or negative mood states . On the one hand , positive or negative mood states may affect creativity through the idea - generation process ; on the other hand , positive or negative mood states may also affect the likelihood of idea implementation by influencing the impressions of users held by v the firm’s experts . V24 : Popularity In the collaborative crowdsourcing community , users can freely browse , comment , and vote on the ideas of a user . Thus , the number of views , comments , and votes are good indicators of an idea’s popularity in the community . Prior research has demonstrated the impact of popularity on the likelihood of idea implementation ( Di Gangi & Wasko , 2009 ; Li et al . , 2016 ; Schemmann et al . , 2016 ; Ma et al . , 2019 ; Hoornaert et al . , 2017 ) . Table 1 is the PKM - based prediction model for the likelihood of idea implementation , which summarizes the quantitative metrics for all the dimensions in our study . vi Appendix II . Operationalization of Idea Implementation and Measure Variables The Operationalization of Idea Implementation To train the selected supervised learning algorithms , sufficient data with idea implementation labels are required . These labels refer to the outcome of idea submissions ( e . g . , implemented or not implemented ) , which is the objective result of the comprehensive measurement of an idea’s innovation value ( Bayus , 2013 ) . In the MIUI NFD forum , the firm’s internal experts ( members of the MIUI development group ) provide users with feedback by affixing a seal at the upper - right area of the thread ( see Table II ) . We assign a value of 1 to an implemented idea and a value of 0 to ideas that were not implemented . Table III summarizes the statistics on the ideas’ outcomes . In total , there were 6 , 218 ( 6 . 9 % ) implemented ideas and 83 , 688 ( 93 . 1 % ) unimplemented ideas . Table II . Coding rules for idea implementation Coding rules Seal Instructions Definition Ideas are implemented by the firm experts Labeled “1” SUBMITTED The SUBMITTED seal represents that the idea has been adopted by firm experts and submitted to the product R & D group . COLLECTION The COLLECTION seal represents that the idea has been adopted by firm experts and collected by the product R & D group . PROCESSING The PROCESSING seal indicates that the product R & D group is launching idea - related development . RESOLVED The RESOLVED seal indicates that the product R & D group has completed product updates related to the idea . The firm experts did not implement the idea Labeled “0” No seal Ideas that did not receive the firm experts’ seal were not implemented . UNRESOLVED The UNRESOLVED seal represents that the idea has not been adopted or implemented . PLEASE ADD PLEASE ADD seal represents that the idea lacks adequate information . TO BE DISCUSSED The TO BE DISCUSSED seal indicated that the idea needs further discussion and will not be implemented temporarily . vii HAVE A REPLY The Have A REPLY seal indicates that the firm experts have responded the issues involved in the idea .

The formula is shown as follows , in which A and B is the text representations of ideas . ! " # " $ % & " ' ( ( * , , ) = * ∙ , | | * | | × | | , | | M3 : Similarity to positive label for firm expert preference & M4 : Similarity to negative label for firm expert preference . M3 & M4 is defined as the similarity between idea i and the implemented / unimplemented ideas in the community . First , we segmented Chinese sentences into phrases using the JieBa segmentation package , removed stop words ( words which are removed before or after processing of natural language data ) , and kept only the noun phrases . Second , we tokenized all ideas i and implemented / unimplemented ideas into a vector space representation . Third , we calculated cosine similarity between the subsequent idea i and implemented / unimplemented ideas . Finally , we get a sum score of all the cosine similarity score mentioned above as the value of M3 / M4 . M11 : novelty . For novelty , we first applied different methods to generating text representations , including tfidf , LDA representation ( Blei et al . , 2003 ) , doc2vec representation ( Le & Mikolov , 2014 ) , and BERT representation ( Reimers & Gurevych , 2019 ) . In particular , doc2vec and BERT is based on deep learning , and they can convert a sentence / paragraph to a distributed semantic vector . Then , we calculated the variable of “originality” comparing each idea to all prior submitted ideas . Finally , we constructed the PKM - based model using the four different text representation methods . The results show that BERT is the best for novelty measurement despite no significant improvement than other three methods . Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count ( LIWC ) LIWC is a text analysis software along with a group of built - in dictionaries based on Java programming language ( Tausczik & Pennebaker , 2010 ) . It can be used to calculate the proportion of words in a given text that fall into one or more of over 100 psychological , linguistic , and topical categories indicating various social , cognitive , and affective processes . For example , we can use it to determine the degree in which a text uses positive or negative emotions , authentic , risk or affect words . M8 : positive comments from firm experts & M9 : negative comments from firm x experts . We applied LIWC to generate the positive / negative emotion score of the comments from experts on the user’s previous ideas before submitting idea i . M15 : positive emotion & M16 : negative emotion . We applied LIWC to generate the positive / negative emotion score of the idea i . M30 : positive mood state & M31 : negative mood state . We also applied LIWC to generate the positive / negative emotion scores of the comments users posted before submitting idea i . M12 : Customer benefit refers to the monetary - related content of idea i . We used LIWC text analysis software to calculate the score of total words that match the Money category to all the words in idea i . The Money category includes words such as money , cost , value , benefit , expenditure , price , business , investment , payment , etc . M10 : Feasibility - related Feedback refers to the feedback content ( comments from others ) related to product implementation risks obtained by users before submitting idea i . We used LIWC text analysis software to calculate the score of total words that match the Risk category to all the words in the comments obtained by users before submitting idea i . The Risk category includes words such as mistakes , doubt , worry , mistakes , accidents , loss , etc . M13 : Feasibility refers to the risk - related content of idea i . We used LIWC text analysis software to calculate the score of total words that match the Risk category to all the words in idea i . The Risk category includes words such as mistakes , doubt , worry , mistakes , accidents , loss , etc . Latent Dirichlet Allocation ( LDA ) M14 : Topic dispersion . We applied the Latent Dirichlet Allocation ( LDA ) model ( Blei et al . 2003 ) to the idea content to discover the main topics related to customers’ requirements . The LDA model attempts to extract a hidden structure—based on the co - occurrence of observed words in different documents—that consists of a set of topics in the whole body of text . To determine the topic number k , following the instruction of Griffiths and Steyvers’ work ( 2004 ) , we calculate coherence scores of LDA models with different topic numbers k ( k (cid:0) K = { 5 , 6 , 7 , … , 25 } ) . Based on Figure I , we set k = 14 as the best topic number , with which LDA model has the highest coherence score . LDA model ( k = 14 ) calculates the posterior distribution of the unobserved variables in the collection of documents . Given a set of documents , the LDA’s output contains two main components . One is the list of topics associated with a set of words , as shown in Table V . The other is a list of documents with a vector , where each dimension indicates the probability of a document belonging to a specific topic . In this work , we define topic dispersion using the Gini index of the probabilities associated with all topics . A high score for topic dispersion denotes that the content is likely to focus on one or a few topics ; smaller scores indicate that the idea content covers many topics . In addition to Gini index , we also adopted standard deviation , Herfindahl – Hirschman Index ( HHI ) , and Entropy to quantifying topic dispersion . The results show that Gini index performs best , although there is no significant improvement than other three measurements . xi Figure I .

We generate the variable abstractness according to Semin and Fiedler’s method ( 1991 ) , namely The Linguistic Category Model ( LCM ) ( Free University of Amsterdam ) . Higher scores denote content that is more abstract ; lower scores indicate the content is more concrete . xiii Sub Task Type : Idea Categories Table VI .
