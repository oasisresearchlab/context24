Cover glasses were soaked in 0 . 1 M NaOH and aminosilanized with ( 3 - aminopropyl ) - 18 triethoxysilane under vacuum . Next , the glasses were treated with Sulfo - SANPAH ( 1 mg / ml in Hepes ) 19 and glass surface was photoactivated with UV - light . After washing with Hepes ( 50mM , pH 8 . 5 ) , EV1 20 in PBS ( 2 . 5  g / cm2 ) was added on top of the cover glass and incubated at + 4 overnight . For 21 noncovalent linking , glasses were treated with 0 . 1 M NaOH . 22 23 Flow cytometry 24 SaOS cells were trypsinised , washed and suspended in blocking buffer ( 1 % FCS in PBS ) . Cells were 25 incubated for 1 h with  2 integrin primary antibody ( 12F1 , BD Biosciences ) and for 1 h with FITC - 26 conjugated anti - mouse secondary antibody ( A16167 , Novex , Life Tecnologies ) . As controls , FITC - 27 labelled cells were used . Cells were washed and suspended in PBS , and  2 integrin levels were 28 measured with FACS Calibur ( BD Biosciences ) . Graphs were drawn with Flowing Software 2 ( Turku 29 Centre for Biotechnology , Turku , Finland ) . 30 2 Immunoprecipitation of  2 -  1 heterodimer 31 SaOS  2 - , SaOS  2 + and SaOS  2E336A cell monolayers were washed with ice cold buffer containing 150 32 mM NaCl , 1mM CaCl 2 , 1mM MgCl 2 , and Tris - HCl ( pH 7 . 4 ) . Cells from three 10 cm plates were 33 collected with 1 ml of a buffer by scraping , and then pooled . Cells were pelleted by centrifugation ( 500 34 G , 4 min ) and the pellets were solubilized with 0 . 5 ml of the same buffer containing 100 mM n - octyl - 6 - 35 D - glycopyranoside ( Sigma ) on ice for 15 min with occasional vortexing . The lysates were cleared first 36 by centrifugation ( 13000 G , 4 min , + 4 ) and then by 1 hour incubation with G - Sepharose 4 Fast Flow 37 beads ( GE Healthcare ) in the presence of bovine serum albumin ( 0 . 5 mg / ml ) and Triton x - 100 ( 0 . 5 38 v / v % ) . The resulting supernatants were immunoprecipitated with  2 integrin 12F1 antibody ( mouse 39 anti - human , BD Biosciences ) for 12 hours and the complexes were recovered by binding to G - 40 Sepharose beads for 1 hour . The beads were washed three times with a buffer containing 150 mM 41 NaCl , 25 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 7 . 4 ) , 0 . 1 v / v % Triton x - 100 and 1 mg / ml bovine serum albumin , and twice 42 with a buffer containing 150 mM NaCl and 25 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 7 . 4 ) . The immunoprecipitates were 43 detached from the beads with a non - reducing Laemmli - buffer ( with SDS ) by boiling for 5 min and 44 analysed by electrophoresis on SDS - PAGE gels . Proteins were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose 45 membrane and the membrane was blocked with blocking buffer ( 5 % milk powder , 1 % BSA , TBST ) 46 for 1 hour .  1 integrin was detected with rabbit  1 antibody R332 ( Heino et al . , 1989 ) in blocking 47 buffer for 1 hour in RT and using a donkey anti - rabbit secondary antibody ( Li - COR IRDye 800CW , 48 Li - COR Biosciences ) . Antibody was removed with stripping buffer ( Glycine - HCl , 2 times 10 min ) .  2 49 integrin was detected with rat anti - human antibody ( R & D Systems , clone 430903 ) in a blocking buffer 50 for 1 hour in RT and using goat anti - rat secondary antibody ( Li - COR IRDye 680RD , Li - COR 51 Biosciences ) . Odyssey CLx from Li - COR Biosciences was used for the detection of fluorescent 52 secondary antibodies . 53 54 Inhibitor - effect on EV1 infection 55 Cells were treated with Safingol ( 10 µM , 30 minutes , Calbiochem ) and NSC 23766 ( 100 µM ; 1 hour ; 56 Santa Cruz Biochemistry , Inc ) prior to and during EV1 infection . Inhibitors were added to the cells in 57 DMEM without serum and incubated at + 37 °C . For EV1 infection assay adherent SaOS  2 + cells were 58 incubated with EV1 in serum free DMEM on ice for 1 hour . Unbound virus was removed by washing 59 the cells with PBS , and DMEM including 10 % FCS was added . Virus infection was allowed to 60 proceed for 5 to 6 hours at + 37 C . Cells were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde ( Thermo Scientific ) for 61 3 20 minutes at room temperature , permeabilised with 0 , 2 % Triton x - 100 in PBS for 5 minutes , and 62 labelled with anti - EV1 antibody 17 and DRAQ5 ( Cell Signaling ) or DABI nuclear label . Cells were 63 imaged with Leica TCS SP5 Matrix or Zeiss Axiovert 200M . Number of infected cells was analysed 64 with BioImage XD 29 . 65 66 Analysis of EV1 infected cells 67 For the analysis of EV1 infection after PKC  and Rac1 inhibition , three replicate wells and 9 images 68 per well were analysed in each experiment . Image analysis was performed with BioImage XD Batch 69 processor – function 29 . Percent of infected cells was calculated as a ratio of EV1 positive areas versus 70 DAPI / DRAQ5 labelled nuclei . Noise from both channels was reduced using Gaussian smoothing – 71 filter . Thresholds for EV1 and DAPI / DRAQ5 channels were determined manually . EV1 channel was 72 segmented using Connected component labelling , and DAPI / DRAQ5 channel using Object separation . 73 Infection percent was calculated using the value Number of segmented objects from each image . 74 75 76 SUPPLEMENTARY REFERENCES 77 78 Buxboim A , Rajaqopal K , Brown AEX , Discher DE ( 2010 ) How deeply cells feel : methods for thin 79 gels .
