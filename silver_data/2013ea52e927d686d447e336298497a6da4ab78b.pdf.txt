Nowadays , insect , microalgae and yeast are feedstuff candidates for new feeds . However , the characterization of aquafeed is still based on proximate and targeted analyses which may not be sufficient to assess feed quality . Objectives Our aim was to highlight the soluble compounds that specifically differ between selected plant - based feeds complemented with alternative feedstuffs and discuss their origin and potential for fish nutrition . Methods A growth trial was carried out to evaluate growth performances and feed conversion ratios of fish fed plant - based , commercial , insect , spirulina and yeast feeds . 1 H NMR metabolomics profiling of each feed was performed using a CPMG sequence on polar extracts . Spectra were processed , and data were analyzed using multivariate and univariate analyses to compare alternative feeds to a plant - based feed . Results Fish fed insect or yeast feed showed the best growth performances associated with the lowest feed conversion ratios compared to plant - based feed . Soluble compound 1 H NMR profiles of insect and spirulina alternative feeds differed signifi - cantly from the plant - based one that clustered with yeast feed . In insect and spirulina feeds , specific differences compared to plant - based feed concerned glycerol and 3 - hydroxybutyrate , respectively . Conclusion This strategy based on compositional differences between plant - based and alternative feeds can be useful for detecting compounds unsuspected until now that could impact fish metabolism .

Fish feed has evolved considerably to support such trends , moving progressively from traditional fish meal ( FM ) and fish oil ( FO ) based feeds to plant - based ( PB ) feeds . The difficulty of supplying all aquaculture sectors with marine resources has been the main reason for replacing FM , which is now largely substituted by cereals and grain legumes ( National Research Council ( U . S . ) 2011 ) . In salmonids , including rainbow trout , FO can be substituted almost exclusively by vegetable oil , which provides essential fatty acid precursors of the long chain Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article ( https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1007 / s1130 6 - 018 - 1454 - 5 ) contains supplementary material , which is available to authorized users . * Simon Roques simon . roques @ inra . fr Extended author information available on the last page of the article S . Roques et al . 1 3 155 Page 2 of 12 polyunsaturated fatty acids docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) and eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) ( Oliva - Teles et al . 2015 ) . The total replacement of FM for carnivorous species by PB feedstuffs , however , leads to reduced growth performances , mainly due to numerous anti - nutritional factors and unbal - anced amino acid profiles ( Geay et al . 2011 ; Collins et al . 2013 ; Lazzarotto et al . 2018 ) . Furthermore , the exclusive use of PB feedstuffs for aquaculture is no longer sustainable . For example , the land used for PB feedstuff production is the same as that used for other livestock feeds and human nutrition ( Troell et al . 2014 ) . Thus , there is an urgent need of alternatives to FM and PB products , either other animal protein feedstuffs such as insects , or micro - organisms such as microalgae and yeast . The potential for insects to be included in the formulation of animal feeds is gaining importance thanks to their high protein content and well - balanced amino acid profiles ( Rum - pold and Schluter 2013 ; van Huis 2013 ; Barroso et al . 2014 ; Henry et al . 2015 ; Barragan - Fonseca et al . 2017 ) . Promising results with insect meals have been obtained in carnivorous species including rainbow trout ( St - Hilaire et al . 2007 ; Sea - ley et al . 2011 ; Lock et al . 2016 ; Stadtlander et al . 2017 ) . Microalgae have mostly been used for DHA and EPA sub - stitution and as feed supplement rather than as FM substitu - tion , yet their nutritional values are promising for aquacul - ture feeding with high contents of protein and high protein digestibility ( Nakagawa and Montgomery 2007 ; Teimouri et al . 2013 ) . Spirulina platensis is commonly described as a microalga although it belongs to the cyanobacteria due to several common characteristics such as a prokaryotic struc - ture and peptidoglycan - based cell walls , as opposed to cellu - lose in algae ( Belay et al . 1996 ; Spolaore et al . 2006 ; Becker 2007 ) . Yeast , another micro - organism widely known in ani - mal nutrition to provide high quality nutrients , can also be used as a probiotic and for its immune stimulant properties in the form of yeast cell walls ( Ferreira et al . 2010 ; Ringø et al . 2010 ; Navarrete and Tovar - Ramrez 2014 ; Broadway et al . 2015 ) . Indeed , yeast cell walls have mainly been used in fish nutrition for their immune function enhancement but have not yet been tested as a substitute for FM ( Robersten et al . 1990 ; Jørgensen et al . 1993 ; Gopalakannan and Arul 2010 ; Refstie et al . 2010 ; Meena et al . 2013 ) . Commercial fish feeds are usually characterized by their feedstuff composition and their chemical proximate compo - sition , which indicates the protein , lipid and carbohydrate content , as well as amino acids and fatty acids profile of the feed ( Jobling 2016 ) . It is possible to predict the nutritional value of a feed based on its chemical nutritional profile . However , this does not guarantee that feed will be well tol - erated by fish because of the possible presence of antinu - tritional factors or other compounds . Large differences in feedstuff quality , as revealed by their severe impact on fish growth and metabolism , appear to be related to compounds other than macro - nutrients such as anti - nutritional factors and derivative compounds produced by poor processing conditions ( Cheng et al . 2016 ) . Thus , the numerous solu - ble compounds in feeds and feedstuffs originating either from feedstuff itself or from their processing need to be characterized . Metabolomics is a reliable technique used in the food industry to assess the authenticity and quality of foods ( Wishart 2008 ; Cevallos - Cevallos et al . 2009 ; Mannina et al . 2012 ; Astarita and Langridge 2013 ) . Over the last decade , metabolomics approaches have emerged in fish nutrition to assess the impact of alternative feedstuffs and diets on fish metabolism ( Kullgren et al . 2010 ; Schock et al . 2012 ; Wagner et al . 2014 ; Gatesoupe et al . 2018 ) . Recent stud - ies have used targeted metabolomics directly on fish feeds combined with metabolomics on fish . Using 1 H NMR profil - ing , Cheng et al . ( 2017 ) identified specific compounds in a diet containing Baltic Sea FM with mussel meal and intact yeast that impacted salmon metabolic response . Jasour et al . ( 2017 ) demonstrated the importance of oxidation products in feather meal feedstuff used as a protein source on amino acid digestibility . Similarly , they showed that biogenic amines present in FM modulate growth performances ( Jasour et al . 2018 ) . These findings support the idea that numerous solu - ble feed compounds account for fish feed quality , although untargeted analyses of feeds are rarely carried out to char - acterize their profiles . Using 1 H NMR metabolomics , we analyzed soluble com - pounds of selected plant - based feeds supplemented either by insect larvae ( Hermetia illucens ) meal , microalgae ( S . platensis ) biomass or yeast ( Saccharomyces cerevisiae ) pro - tein fraction . A trial was implemented in rainbow trout to investigate the effect of each experimental feed on growth compared with trout fed plant - based feed or FM - and FO - based feed as a reference . Our results show that some of the feeds supplemented with alternative feedstuffs presented higher intensities of specific compounds compared to the plant - based feed . Some of these compounds are discussed for their potential impact on fish metabolism . 2 Materials and methods 2 . 1 Fish experimental design The experiment was carried out in the INRA experimental facilities ( UMR1419 Nutrition , Métabolisme , Aquaculture , Donzacq , France ) authorized for animal experimentation by the French veterinary service , which is the competent authority ( A 64 - 495 - 1 ) . The experiment was in strict accord - ance with EU legal frameworks concerning the protection of animals used for scientific research ( Directive 2010 / 63 / EU ) and according to the National Guidelines for Animal Characterizing alternative feeds for rainbow trout ( O . mykiss ) by 1 H NMR metabolomics 1 3 Page 3 of 12 155 Care of the French Ministry of Research ( decree n°2013 - 118 , February 1st , 2013 ) . The scientists in charge of the experimentation received training and personal authorization ( N°B64 10 005 ) . In agreement with the ethical committee “Comité d’Ethique Aquitaine Poissons Oiseaux” ( C2EA - 73 ) , the experiment reported here did not need approval by a specific ethical committee since it involved only classical rearing practices with all diets used in the experiment for - mulated to cover the nutritional requirements of rainbow trout . During the experiment , fish were monitored daily . If any clinical symptoms ( i . e . morphological abnormality , rest - lessness or uncoordinated movements ) were observed , fish were sedated by immersion in 10 mg / l benzocaine solution and then euthanized by immersion in a 60 mg / l benzocaine solution ( anesthetic overdose ) for 3 min . Fifteen groups of thirty juvenile rainbow trout ( Onco - rhynchus mykiss ) were randomly constituted ( five diets in triplicates ) . The mean initial body weight was 48 . 98 ± 1 . 00 g ( n = 450 fish ) and it was not significantly different between the tanks . Fish were reared in 100 L tanks in a flow - through system supplied with natural spring water at 17 ± 1 °C . Fish were fed twice daily until visual satiety . The duration of the experiment was 84 days . Mortality was recorded daily . The total biomass and the amount of feed distributed per tank were recorded every 3 weeks . The mean body weight per tank was calculated by dividing the total biomass by the number of fish alive in the tank . Feed conversion ratio ( FCR ) per tank was calculated by dividing the biomass gain by the amount of feed distributed . 2 . 2 Feed description and characterization Five different feeds were tested : a commercial - like ( COM ) feed containing FM and FO , a totally plant - based feed ( PB ) and plant - based feeds with 15 % insect meal ( INS ) , spirulina biomass ( SPI ) or yeast protein fraction ( YST ) , respectively ( Table 1 ) . A fraction of plant proteins and vegetable oils were substituted with each alternative feedstuff depending on their composition to get isoenergetic , isolipidic and iso - proteic diets ( proximate compositions are detailed in Online Resource 1 ) . The insect meal was prepared as for a fish pro - tein concentrate : live larvae were frozen , then successively minced , ground and sieved . The mixture was defatted by centrifugation and the supernatant which contained most of the lipid fraction was removed . The residue which contained the protein - enriched fraction was collected and dried . The spirulina meal was prepared from whole spirulina which was dried then ground . The yeast protein fraction was produced from autolyzed yeast , then separated to obtain the parietal fraction which was further dried . The feeds were produced at the INRA experimental fish facility ( Donzacq , France ) . Pellets were obtained using an extrusion cooking process ( CLEXTRAL BC45 extruder with double screw , Firminy , France ) with a 44 . 5 bar pressure and a 52 °C mean tem - perature then dried at 40 °C with an air flux for a minimum of 2 h . A sample of pellets was collected just after produc - tion and stored at − 20 °C until extraction . Approximately 1 g of frozen pellets of each diet was cryo - ground ( 6750 Freezer / Mill , Spex SamplePrep , Metuchen , USA ) before freeze - drying . Extraction was performed on five randomized replicates of 50 . 0 ± 0 . 5 mg of freeze - dried powder as previously pub - lished by Moing et al . ( 2004 ) . Briefly , lyophilized powdered samples were successively extracted with 2 ml of 80 / 20 ( v / v ) ethanol ( Absolute , Sigma - Aldrich , St Quentin - Fallavier , France ) and MilliQ water ( Millipore , Molsheim , France ) , 2 ml of 50 / 50 ethanol and MilliQ water and 3 ml of 0 / 100 ethanol and MilliQ water at 80 °C for 15 min . The super - natants were combined , dried under vacuum ( SpeedVac Savant , Asheville , USA ) and freeze - dried . Extracts were Table 1 Feed formulation ( g / 100 g feed ) of control feeds ( COM , PB ) and experimental feeds ( INS , SPI , YST ) All feedstuffs are displayed in g / 100 g of feed a Processed animal proteins : blood meal , hydrolyzed feather meal , poultry meal b Vegetable oils : rapeseed oil and linseed oil c Plant proteins : wheat gluten , hydrolyzed wheat gluten , pea protein , fababean protein concentrate , soy concentrate , soybean meal , rape - seed meal , peeled fababean and wheat . Amongst the plant proteins , soybean meal , rapeseed meal and peeled fababean were only used in COM feed .

Roques et al . 1 3 155 Page 4 of 12 then solubilized in 300 µl of a deuterated solution [ 200 mM potassium phosphate buffer solution , 2 mM ethylene diamine tetra - acetic acid disodium salt ( EDTA ) ] at appar - ent pH 6 . EDTA was added to chelate paramagnetic cations in order to improve the spectrum resolution , especially in the citrate area . The pH was adjusted to apparent pH 6 . 00 ± 0 . 02 using NaOD or DCl by means of a titration robot ( BTpH , Bruker , Kalrsruhe , Germany ) . Adjusted extracts were fro - zen and freeze - dried . The dried pH - adjusted extracts were stored in obscurity under vacuum at room temperature until 1 H NMR analysis . Each extract was solubilized in 600 µl of D 2 O and 10 µl of TSP [ ( trimethylsilyl ) propionic - 2 , 2 , 3 , 3 - d4 acid sodium salt ] 9 . 5 mM before vortexing and 5 min cen - trifuging at 17 , 746× g ( Juan A14 , ThermoFisher Scientific , City , country ) . Five hundred and fifty microliters were then transferred to a 5 mm NMR tube ( Wilmad , Vineland , USA ) for NMR acquisition . For NMR analysis , D 2 O ( 99 . 8 % D ) was purchased from Eurisotop ( Gif sur Yvette , France ) , TSP ( 98 % ) and EDTA from Sigma - Aldrich . 2 . 3 NMR acquisition NMR spectra were acquired on a Bruker Avance III 500 MHz spectrometer ( Bruker , Wissembourg , France ) operating at 500 . 16 MHz at 300 K using a 5 mm ATMA broadband inverse probe flushed with nitrogen gas . 1D spectra were acquired using a Carr – Purcell – Meiboom – Gill ( CPMG ) sequence with a T2 filter to remove macromolecule signals and pre - saturation to remove the water signal . CPMG acquisition sequence does not give quantitative information because it reduces signal intensities of compounds based on their spin – spin ( T2 ) relaxation times , and signal inten - sity is no longer correlated to absolute concentration only . Moreover , the short recycle delay ( 2 s ) may truncate FID of long spin – lattice ( T1 ) resonances . However , comparisons of a selected bin intensity between samples remained possible as acquisition parameters were kept constant . Sixteen scans of 64K data points were recorded with a 90° pulse angle , a 6000 Hz spectral width , a 5 . 46 s acquisition time , a 2 s recycle delay , 200 µs echo time and 400 loops , preceded by 16 dummy scans . The assignments of metabolites in the 1 H NMR spectra were based on chemical shifts , signal multiplicities , inten - sity ratios , comparison with database values ( HMDB , http : / / www . hmdb . ca , BMRB , http : / / www . bmrb . wisc . edu and Che - nomX NMR Suite 8 . 3 library ( ChenomX Inc . , Edmonton , Canada ) ) and with spectra of authentic compounds recorded in the same solvent conditions ( in - house library ) and by spiking the samples with corresponding compound stand - ards when doubt remained . 2D NMR experiments ( COSY , Correlation SpetroscopY ; HSQC , Heteronuclear Single Quantum Correlation ; HMBC , Heteronuclear Multiple Bond Correlation ) with non - uniform sampling ( NUS percent at 25 % and 128 points for COSY and HSQC and 512 points for HMBC ) were performed for selected samples for assignment verification . COSY experiment observed 1 H nuclei in both direct and indirect dimensions where 16 dummy scans pre - ceded a 64 - scan series of 8 . 97 µs 90° pulse in each dimen - sion . Spectral width was 6000 Hz for each dimension , with 4K data points in f2 and 1K in f1 . The HSQC experiment observed 1 H in direct dimension and 13 C in indirect dimen - sion , 16 dummy scans preceded a 128 - scan series of 8 . 97 µs 90° pulse in direct dimension and 14 . 50 µs 90° pulse in indi - rect dimension . Spectral width was 20 , 000 Hz in indirect dimension and 6 , 000 in the direct one , 2K data points were recorded in the direct dimension and 1K in the indirect one . The HMBC experiment observed 1 H in direct dimension and 13 C in indirect dimension , 16 dummy scans preceded a 128 - scan series of 8 . 50 µs 90° pulse in direct dimension and 14 . 50 µs 90° pulse in the indirect dimension . Spectral width was 30 , 000 Hz in indirect dimension and 6000 in the direct one , 4K data points were recorded in the direct dimension and 2K in the indirect one . The 2D spectrum was recon - structed using the recursive multidimensional decomposition available within the Bruker software . Identification levels were based on the Metabolomics Standards Initiative ( Sumner et al . 2007 ) . A representative 1 H NMR CPMG spectrum of each feed extract has been uploaded to the Zenodo repository ( https : / / zenod o . org / recor d / 14231 24 ; https : / / doi . org / 10 . 5281 / zenod o . 14231 24 ) . 2 . 4 Spectra processing Free induction decay ( FID ) , spectra processing , signal - to - noise ratio determination and spectral data reduction ( binning ) were processed using the NMRProcFlow tool ( Jacob et al . 2017 ) . Prior to Fourier transformation , each FID was zero - filled to 256K data points and multiplied by an exponential window function with a line broadening of 0 . 3 Hz . Spectra were then automatically zero - order phased and manually calibrated on – CH 3 groups of TSP - d4 ( δ 0 ppm ) before manual baseline correction and resonance alignments . Residual water signal ( δ 4 . 768 – 4 . 789 ppm ) was excluded . Binning was performed by the adaptive intelligent binning method of Meyer et al . ( 2008 ) on the spectral area δ 0 . 896 – 9 . 134 ppm . Binning consists in dividing spectra into smaller spectral regions or “bins” to isolate and integrate the area under the signal curve to obtain extracted bin intensities . The total intensity of each spectrum was kept constant and each spectral bin inten - sity was normalized to this constant sum before exporting the resulting table of relative bin intensities for statistical analyses . Spectral bins with a signal - to - noise ratio under 3 were removed . Thereafter , relative bin intensities will be referred as “relative intensities” . Characterizing alternative feeds for rainbow trout ( O . mykiss ) by 1 H NMR metabolomics 1 3 Page 5 of 12 155 2 . 5 Data analyses Statistical analyses were performed with R statistical software ( v . 3 . 3 . 2 , R Development Core Team , 2008 ) and BioStatFlow web application ( v . 2 . 8 , http : / / www . biost atflo w . org ) . To study the effect of feed on fish final body weight and FCR , the three supplemented plant - based feeds were compared to the COM and PB control feeds . First , a one - way ANOVA was carried out on the five feeds to assess their effect on final body weight . Then , the mean fish final body weight or FCR of each experimental feed was compared to the COM or PB control mean by using Student’s t test . Differences were considered statistically significant when P < 0 . 05 . For feed analysis , a principal component analysis ( PCA ) was run on 473 1 H NMR spectral bins used as variables for a total of 23 feed samples after removal of one outlier sample in PB and one in COM feed . Variables were Pareto - scaled prior to PCA . The same 473 variables were used for volcano plot analyses with Wilcoxon’s test with false discovery rate ( FDR ) correction . Signals with significant differences at the P < 0 . 001 level and fold threshold between means set to 2 were considered to highlight the most affected spectral bins . 3 Results 3 . 1 Fish zootechnical performances Fish final body weight and FCR of juvenile rainbow trout fed control and experimental feeds for 84 days are pre - sented in Table 2 . Feeds had a significant impact on final body weight ( ANOVA , P = 0 . 023 ) . Fish fed INS and YST feeds had a significantly higher body weight than fish fed PB feed ( Student’s t test , P = 0 . 004 and P = 0 . 010 , respec - tively ) . Final body weight of the SPI and COM groups did not significantly differ from that of the PB group ( Student’s t test , P = 0 . 219 and P = 0 . 0625 , respectively ) . However , the P - value ( P = 0 . 065 ) for the COM group was close to the defined threshold , indicating a trend in higher body weight . Final body weight in the COM group was not significantly different from that of the other groups . FCR differed significantly between the feeds ( ANOVA , P = 0 . 002 ) . INS , YST and COM diets were significantly more efficient than PB ( Student’s t test ) . On the other hand , SPI feed did not differ from COM or PB feeds . 3 . 2 Feed composition overview with PCA A PCA was performed on the 473 spectral bins of the 1 H NMR CPMG feed profiles ( Fig . 1 ) . The first two principal components ( PCs ) explained 82 % of the total variance . Feed extract samples were well clustered and clearly sepa - rated depending on the feedstuff composition , except for YST feed samples which overlapped PB ones . INS and COM feeds were both on the positive side of PC1 , com - pared to PB and YST feeds on the negative side , and they clearly separated along PC2 . SPI , PB and COM samples were clearly separated . SPI samples had an intermediary position between PB and COM feeds .

Roques et al . 1 3 155 Page 6 of 12 3 . 3 Comparison of each alternative feed with PB Volcano plot analyses on the 473 1 H NMR CPMG spec - tral bins of feed extracts were used to assess which spectral regions and corresponding compounds differentiated INS , SPI or YST alternative feeds from the PB control ( Fig . 2 and Online Resources 3 and 4 ) . In INS feed ( Fig . 2a ) , 119 1 H NMR spectral bins were significantly higher and 19 bins were significantly lower than in PB feed with the chosen thresholds . The highest significant log 2 ( FC ) reached almost 5 and the lowest was almost − 4 . For SPI diet ( Fig . 2b ) , 93 1 H NMR spectral bins were significantly higher , whereas 6 bins were significantly lower than in PB feed with the chosen thresholds . The highest significant log 2 ( FC ) reached about 4 . 5 and the lowest was about − 2 . 5 . For YST feed ( Online Resource 2 ) , only one 1 H NMR bin was significantly higher , while none was lower than in PB feed . The log 2 ( FC ) associ - ated of this bin was 1 . 5 . The 1 H NMR spectral bins high - lighted with the volcano plots were tentatively annotated . Figures 3 and 4 shows annotated superimposition of one representative 1 H NMR CPMG spectrum for INS or for SPI compared to one representative spectrum of PB feed extract , respectively . Signals were well super - imposed within each feed , which demonstrated a good reproducibility . The annotated signals—16 in INS and 12 in SPI—correspond to spectral bins that fulfilled the volcano plot thresholds ( Online Resources 3 and 4 ) . INS feed exhibited higher relative intensities of four essential free amino acids—isoleucine , leucine , valine , and phe - nylalanine—compared to PB feed . Similarly , the relative intensities of free non - essential and other free amino acids , alanine , proline , tyrosine and pyroglutamate , were higher in INS feed compared to PB . The relative intensities of the organic acids lactate and succinate were also higher in INS feed compared to PB . Finally , glucose , glycerol ( showing the highest fold change of 31 ) , phosphocholine , ethanola - mine , uridine , hypoxanthine and carnitine were identified , and their relative intensities were also higher in INS than in PB feed . We verified the presence of glycerol in the INS feedstuff polar extract , as it presented the highest fold change in the corresponding feed ( Online Resource 6A ) . For SPI feed , the relative intensities of four essential free amino acids , isoleucine , leucine , valine and phenylala - nine , were higher than in PB feed . The non - essential free amino acids ornithine , alanine and glutamate , the organic acids lactate , 3 - hydroxybutyrate ( showing the highest fold change of 22 ) as well as AMP and trehalose were also identified in SPI feed and their relative intensities were higher than in PB feed . We verified the presence of 3 - hydroxybutyrate in an SPI feedstuff polar extract as it presented the highest fold change in the corresponding diet ( Online Resource 6B ) .

In the quest for sustainable feed , we focused on INS , YST and SPI . Thanks to an approach based on untargeted feed characterization , numerous free soluble compounds were highlighted . Several of these compounds are known to have an impact on fish metabolism and could thus potentially help to explain differences in growth per - formances . Growth and FCR were significantly impacted by several alternative diets compared to PB . Our findings indi - cate that INS or YST feedstuff inclusion in these plant - based feeds can improve growth performances of trout . Insect meal and yeast are already known to be good candidates for FM substitution in rainbow trout and Atlantic salmon ( Øverland et al . 2013 ; Stadtlander et al . 2017 ) . However , the price of each of these feedstuffs is higher than that of fish meal so far , especially for insect meal as insect production chains are still emerging . Our results confirm the interest of complementing PB feeds with insect or yeast feedstuffs . Similar soluble compounds were found in YST and PB feed . The yeast feedstuff used was a yeast parietal fraction . Yeast cell walls are widely composed of non - soluble poly - saccharides , mainly β - glucans , mannan - oligosaccharides and proteins . This probably explains why so few of the soluble compounds of YST and PB feed are significantly different ( Lesage and Bussey 2006 ; Alsteens et al . 2008 ) . Therefore , the higher growth performance of YST feed compared to PB feed cannot be attributed to a direct effect of soluble compounds . However , it could be reasonably ascribed to other demonstrated effects such as changes in gut health and the immune effect of yeast cell walls , which could offset the negative effect of pathogens or enhance nutrient digestibility ( Jørgensen et al . 1993 ; Refstie et al . 2010 ; Broadway et al . 2015 ) . On the other hand , differences in the relative intensities of soluble compounds in INS and PB feeds were greater . The insect meal tested contained high quantities of low molecular weight compounds ( see molecular weight profile in Online Resource 5 ) . This seems in agreement with the higher relative intensities of several free amino acids found Fig . 3 Superimposition of one representative 1 H NMR CPMG spec - trum of a polar extract for INS and one for PB feed . a Spectral region δ 0 . 75 – 5 . 5 ppm . b Spectral region δ 5 . 5 – 9 . 2 ppm .

Roques et al . 1 3 155 Page 8 of 12 in the INS feed than in the PB feed . Feeding high levels of low molecular weight compounds to carnivorous fish such as salmon or trout has been shown to increase growth ( Hevroy et al . 2005 ; Aksnes et al . 2006 ) . A similar positive impact on growth was also observed with insect meal in the pre - sent study performed in rainbow trout . It is known that free amino acids and small peptides are absorbed specifically and more rapidly than the bolus of amino acids produced by protein digestion , especially in juveniles ( Oliva - Teles et al . 1999 ; Lundquist and Artursson 2016 ; Wang et al . 2017 ) . Furthermore , amino acids , especially branched - chain amino acids , are known as signaling molecules . Together with insu - lin , branched - chain amino acids , especially leucine , contrib - ute to the activation of the TOR signaling pathway , which regulates protein translation and metabolism ( Seiliez et al . 2008 ; Laplante and Sabatini 2012 ; Zhang et al . 2017 ) . As the highest relative intensities of free branched - chain amino acids were found in INS feeds , which exhibited the best growth performances , our results support the hypothesis that the positive impact on growth with INS feedstuff may be due to enhanced protein synthesis under amino acid stimulation . Glycerol relative intensities were higher in INS feed than in PB . Some insect larvae are known to produce glycerol , which protects insects from extreme cold temperatures ( Sto - rey and Storey 2012 ) . Moreover , the analysis of the insect raw material used in the present study confirmed that the glycerol originated from this feedstuff . In fish nutrition , glycerol is primarily a substrate of lipid metabolism for the synthesis of triglycerides and phospholipids . However , this substrate is not limiting due to the large dietary supply of lipids . Glycerol seems to act as an energetic substrate in herbivorous species such as Nile tilapia ( Oreochromis niloticus ) . However , in carnivorous species , Menton et al . ( 1986 ) reported that glycerol is not an effective energy sup - plier because its conversion into glucose exceeds the glu - cose requirement of such fish ( Neu et al . 2013 ; da Costa et al . 2015 , 2017 ) . Glycerol could act as a microorganism substrate , as Enterococus populations are modulated in gut microbiota of rainbow trout fed insect feed ( Bruni et al . 2018 ) . In addition , microbiota plays a key role in glycerol degradation in human ( Weirdt et al . 2010 ) . However , our data are too limited to support this hypothesis .

Spectrum of PB feed extract in green and that of SPI in red Characterizing alternative feeds for rainbow trout ( O . mykiss ) by 1 H NMR metabolomics 1 3 Page 9 of 12 155 The dried spirulina biomass used in the present study contained a complete set of the micro - organism metabolites . Indeed , the higher fold change with SPI feed corresponded to 3 - hydroxybutyrate . Like several micro - organisms , S . platensis is known to synthesize poly - 3 - hydroxybutyrate ( PHB ) and activate depolymerization to use monomers as carbon source under nitrogen - starved conditions ( Jau et al . 2005 ) . Moderate inclusion levels of poly ( 3 - hydroxybu - tyrate ) enhance growth in the carnivorous fish European sea bass and Siberian sturgeon , but there are still no data on 3 - hydroxybutyrate supplied in the free form as in SPI feed ( Schryver et al . 2010 ; Najdegerami et al . 2012 ) . As a ketone body , 3 - hydroxybutyrate could be used as energy substrate in the event of glucose depletion during fasting for specific tissues such as brain and heart in mammals ( Newman and Verdin 2017 ) . Moreover , 3 - hydroxybutyrate could act as an epimetabolite ( Showalter et al . 2017 ) by inducing lysine histone methylation ( Newman and Verdin 2017 ) . However , little is known about its utilization in fish . Similarly , higher relative intensities of trehalose were detected in SPI compared to PB feed . This higher intensity may directly result from trehalose presence in the SPI feed - stuff , and suggests that the spirulina culture conditions may have been sub - optimal as S . plantensis is known to produce trehalose under stress ( Ohmori et al . 2009 ) . Trehalose in rainbow trout can be hydrolyzed into glucose by brush bor - der trehalase in gastrointestinal mucosa , but the regulation of its enzymatic activity by carbohydrates in diets is unclear as contradictory results were found with other disaccharide enzymes ( Buddington and Hilton 1987 ; Krogdahl et al . 2004 ) . To check this hypothesis , the production of glucose from trehalose should be monitored in trout . Other mechanisms such as the effect of microbiota or differences in the digestibility of diets are probably involved in the growth performances of alternative feeds . Apparent digestibility of alternative feedstuffs should not be the main cause of growth performance differences as it seems quite high in yeast protein fraction ( 92 . 1 % of protein , unpublished data ) and in published data on similar feeds including spir - ulina biomass and H . illucens larvae meal ( Hernández et al . 2012 ; Magalhães et al . 2017 ) . However , our untargeted approach highlighted several compounds that are rarely described in the analysis of feeds , despite their potential metabolic activity . Their role deserves to be investigated into more detail . 5 Conclusions 1 H NMR metabolomics profiling revealed differences in the soluble compounds of new aquaculture feeds , except for YST feed that could not be discriminated from PB feed due to the low solubility of the cell wall fraction of the yeast feedstuff . Numerous soluble compounds in INS and SPI feeds differed from those in PB feed . Some of these compounds are spe - cific to the insect or to the microalgae . This metabolomic approach to feed characterization could prove relevant in revealing unsuspected compounds that potentially impact fish metabolism . Future trends in the untargeted analysis of aquaculture feeds should also focus on the characterization of alternative feedstuffs themselves to assess their potential values and limits .
