MATERIALS SCIENCE Capillarity - induced folds fuel extreme shape changes in thin wicked membranes Paul Grandgeorge , 1 Natacha Krins , 2 Aurélie Hourlier - Fargette , 1 , 3 Christel Laberty - Robert , 2 Sébastien Neukirch , 1 Arnaud Antkowiak 1 , 4 * Soft deformable materials are needed for applications such as stretchable electronics , smart textiles , or soft biomedical devices . However , the design of a durable , cost - effective , or biologically compatible version of such a material remains challenging . Living animal cells routinely cope with extreme deformations by unfolding preformed membrane reservoirs available in the form of microvilli or membrane folds . We synthetically mimicked this behavior by creating nanofibrous liquid - infused tissues that spontaneously form similar reservoirs through capillarity - induced folding . By understanding the physics of membrane buckling within the liquid film , we developed proof - of - concept conformable chemical surface treatments and stretchable basic electronic circuits . G eometry is behind the curious mechani - cal behavior of the capture silk spun by ecribellate spiders : Whether stretched or compressed , this fiber remains straight while seemingly adjusting its length , as if telescopic . In reality , the pulling force caused by surface tension allows coiling , spooling , and packing of excess fiber within the glue droplets decoratingthethread . These fiberreservoirscan be recruited on demand and give the thread an apparent extreme stretchability of + 10 , 000 % ( 1 ) . Another example arecellsthatdisplaya particu - lar ability to cope with stretch . Macrophages ex - tend their surface area by a factor of 5 to engulf large microbes or cellular debris ( 2 ) , patroling Tlymphocytesstretchby40 % tosqueezeintothe microvasculature ( 3 ) , hundreds of micrometer - sized neuronal projections extrude from 10 - m m - wide neurons ( 4 , 5 ) , and the osmotic swelling of fibroblasts leads to a 70 % increase in area ( 6 ) . Such an extreme deformability is all the more spectacular given that the lytic stretching level atwhichtheplasmamembranerupturesisabout4 % ( 4 , 7 ) . Why do these cells not burst under stress ? Cells store excess membrane in the form offoldsand microvilli ( 8 , 9 ) thatcanberecruited and deployed on demand . These local geometri - cal ruffles do not alter the global shape of the cell , because cellular tension is preserved with thepulling actionoftheunderlyingcorticalactin layer ( 10 ) . The considerable deformations that biological materials undergo could inspire a new generation of synthetic stretchable materials , which are in demand for emerging technologies such as stretchable electronics ( 11 ) , flexible bat - teries ( 12 ) , smarttextiles ( 13 ) , biomedicaldevices , tissue engineering , and soft robotics ( 14 , 15 ) . Our technique for making synthetic fabrics withhighstretchabilitytakesadvantageofspon - taneously formed membrane folds and ruffles . Figure1illustratesthekeystepsin designingsuch an extensible tissue . We first manufacture , using an electrospinning technique , a light and free - standing nonwoven fabric made of poly ( vinylidene fluoride - co - hexafluoropropylene ) ( PVDF - HFP ; Fig . 1 ) ( 16 ) . Without further treatment , this mem - brane would show early signs of damage above a few percent of extension and would rupture at 30 % area extension . We therefore infuse the fibrous membrane with a wetting liquid , so as to mimic the pulling action of the cortical actin layer with surface tension . The membrane be - comes tight while seemingly adjusting its sur - face , storinganyexcessmembraneintoavenation network ( visible in Fig . 1 and movie S1 ) , thus remaining globally flat . These veinsaremade of membrane ruffles and furrows that can be un - folded as required , fueling any imposed shape change to the membrane . By buffering excess membraneand mediating stretching , theseveins play the same role as the membrane reservoirs in living cells , and we therefore refer to these structures as reservoirs . The unfolding process is reversible ; the membrane reservoirs , after being smoothed out upon extension , spontaneously reform upon compression . To elucidate the mechanics of membrane res - ervoir formation , we investigated the inner conformationofthemembranewithintheliquidfilm .

( A ) A thin fibrous membrane ( electrospun PVDF - HFP membrane dyed blue ) and the corresponding scanning electron microscope micrograph . The membrane has a typical thickness of a few micrometers ; the fibers composing it have diameters around 300 nm . Scale bar , 50 m m . ( B ) The membrane is attached to eight translational supports and wicked with 3 cSt silicone oil . ( C to E ) The eight supports are brought together , but the wicked membrane remains globally flat by locally storing excess membrane in apparent veins . ( F ) A closer view of these veins , or membrane reservoirs , which buffer the imposed deformations on the wicked membrane .

We first focus on the emer - gence of the lightly wrinkled pattern ( Fig . 2B , panelb ) . Wrinklingisatrademarkofthinelastic sheets , anditdevelopsspontaneouslyinavariety of contexts : pinched skin , shriveling fruits ( 17 ) , brain sulci ( 18 ) , hanging curtains ( 19 ) , or , more generally , thin sheets under tension ( 20 ) . This elastic instabilityoccurswhenever acompressed slender structure is bound to a substrate resist - ing deformation . The emerging wavelength l of this particularform of bucklingthereforeresults from a trade - off between the deformation of the membrane and that of the substrate in order to minimize globalenergy . Here , the substrate role is played by the liquid filminterfaces , which can be seenassoftcapillary wallsconfining themem - brane . Experimentsrevealedthatthewavelength l is neither particularly sensitivetotheinterfacial tension g , nor to the fibrous membrane thick - ness t 0 , but scales linearly with the liquid film thickness h , which is measured by means of co - lorimetry ( Fig . 2D and figs . S1 and S2 ) ( 16 ) . We developed a simple model in which a pe - riodicsinusoidalmembraneofbendingstiffness B per unit depth interacts with a liquid film , exposing two free interfaces of surface tension g ( Fig . 2C and figs . S8 and S9 ) ( 16 ) . This model ignores the effects of gravity on wavelength , but gravity only plays an important role in the orientation of the wrinkling pattern ( 16 ) ( figs . S16 to S20 ) . Under the constraint of constant liquid film volume and imposed compression e , we minimize the total energy of the system , consisting of the membrane elastic energy E el = ½ B ∫ k 2 d s and the surface energy E g = 2 g S , where k and S respectively denote the local mem - brane curvature and the exposed surface of the liquid film per unit depth ( 16 ) . The model reveals h / L ec asarelevantparameterofthesystem , where L ec = ( B / g ) 1 / 2 istheelastocapillarylength ( 21 ) . The limit h / L ec < < 1 typically corresponds to everyday - lifesoakedfibrous membranes ( e . g . , wet paperor cloth ) thatsagorbucklegloballywhencompressed , irrespectiveofanysurfacetensioneffects ( Fig . 2C ) . Conversely , our experiment is characterized by valuesof h / L ec > > 1 for whichthemicrostructure differsmarkedlyfromthatofacommonwetfabric : Interface energies can no longer be neglected , and the membrane now buckles under capillary confinement ( Fig . 2C ) . In this regime , the ratio of surface energy to elastic energy scales as E g / E el ~ ( h / L ec ) 2 > > 1 ; that is , any deformation of the liquid surface introduces a strong energetic penalty , which means that in - film wrinkling is a low - energy configuration . This phenomenon is therefore reminiscent of buckling under rigid confinement , for which the wavelength l also scales linearly with the confinement gap h for a given compression e ( 22 ) , and this behavior is re - coveredbyourmodel ( Fig . 2D , inset , andfig . S10 ) . Incontrasttoclassicbucklingunderconfinement ( 22 ) , the experimentally measured wavelengths l prove to be insensitive to compression .

( A ) Polyacrylonitrile ( PAN ) membrane wicked with water and attached to two straight mobile edges . Upon small compression , the wicked membrane exhibits a clear wrinkling pattern ( L = 4 cm ) . ( B ) Close - up on the wicked membrane throughout compression . At its extended state , the wicked membrane is smooth ( a ) and a small compression generates a wrinkled surface of wavelength l ( b ) . Further compression then leads to a two - phase texture ( c ) . One phase corresponds to the wrinkled texture ( wavelength l ) and the other to a closely packed stack of folds , which gradually expands throughout compression . The whole membrane is packed in this stack of folds at the end of compression ( d ) . Scale : 10 l = 3 . 1 mm . ( C ) Physical interpretation of the early wrinkling of the membrane inside the liquid film . Depending on the ratio of liquid film thickness to elasto - capillary length , h / L ec , three different buckling scenarios emerge . ( D ) Experimental wavelength l of the wrinkles observed at an early compression stage of the wicked PAN membrane as a function of the liquid film thickness h for different membrane thicknesses t 0 and wicking liquids . The inset provides the data normalized by the elasto - capillary length L ec ( 16 ) .

This second phase , corresponding to the mem - brane reservoir , consists of tightly stacked folds and is therefore characterized by a high mem - brane storagecapacity ( Fig . 2B ) . Thecoexistence between these phases allows continuous trans - fer of material from one phase to another and ensures the effectiveness of the wicked mem - brane as a stretchable material . Wenextsubjectedwickedmembranestothree different elementary deformations correspond - ingtothestretchingofplanar , cylindricallyshaped , andsphericallyshapedmembranes ( moviesS3 to S5 , respectively ) . Theequilibriumshapeadopted by the wicked membrane in each configuration stronglyresemblesthatofaliquidfilmunderthesameconditions : planar film ( Fig . 3B ) , catenoid ( Fig . 3Eand fig . S5 ) , and bubble ( Fig . 3Hand fig . S6 ) . Once again , this behavior is made apparent by realizing thatin the limit h / L ec > > 1 , theenergy of the wicked membrane is dominated by its capil - lary contribution ; the equilibrium shapes therefore essentiallycorrespondtominimalsurfaces . Although theydifferstronglyinlongevity , fabricationmethods , and internal structure , the wicked membranes and liquid films therefore present interesting similar - ities . Upon closerinspection , however , theshapes of the membranes appear to differ from their liquid counterparts in some respects . For exam - ple , a planar wicked membrane attached on only two straight edges adopts a stable shape ( Fig . 3 , A to C ) , whereas a liquid film in the same configuration would burst . To understand this stabilizationmechanismformembranes , wemust recognize that some regions of the membrane may undergo stretching up to a point where the membrane reservoirs are fully exhausted . For the thin fibers composing the membrane , pure stretching deformations represent a far higher energeticalcostrelativetobendingdeformations ( 23 ) , and as a first approximation , this sharp en - ergeticalpenaltycanbeseenasaninextensibility constraint . The shapes adopted by the planar configuration can therefore be captured with a surface area minimization under isoperimetric constraint ( 16 ) ( figs . S11 toS13 ) . Thismixedliquid - solidbehaviorallowsstabilizationofthecatenoidshapebeyonditsclassicpointofburstingtoun - veilnewequilibria ( 16 ) ( Fig . 3 , DtoF , andfigs .

Thepeculiarbehaviorofourwickedmembrane stems from its compound nature : Capillarity - induced folds allow it to undergo ample shape changes while remaining taut , while its solid underlying matrix provides mechanical robust - ness . Geometrical reorganizations at the micro - structural level ( reservoir folding or unfolding ) are key in the mechanics of the wicked mem - brane , and in particular they prevent any notable Grandgeorge et al . , Science 360 , 296 – 299 ( 2018 ) 20 April 2018 3 of 4 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 A D E G H I F B C Fig . 3 .

This results in a marked resistance of this material to fatigue , as illustratedbytheunvaryingmechanicalresponseofthemembraneaftermorethan100 , 000 cycles of extension and compression by a factor of 10 ( 16 ) ( Fig . 3C and figs . S3 and S4 ) . Themechanicsofreservoirfoldingandunfold - ing is a priori material - independent , as it relies only on a combination of elasticity , capillarity , and geometry ( see tested polymers in table S1 ) . To illustrate a few potential applications , we present some proofs of concept in Fig . 4 . First , we demonstrate how thenatural conformability of the wicked membrane can be used to confer instantchemicalfunctionstononplanarsurfaces . As an example , we tune the chemical surface propertiesofazirconbead . Atitsnativestate , the beadisdippedand pulled outfromadyed - water bath , thus withdrawing a liquid film . Zircon is only partially wet by water , and the liquid film coating the bead therefore rapidly disintegrates into a series of droplets ( Fig . 4A , panel a , and movie S6 ) . We now cover the bead with a hydro - philic ( PAN ) membrane and repeat the experi - ment . As soon as the bead is pulled out from the bath , the membrane folds within the drawn liq - uid film and therefore adapts to the bead curva - ture ( Fig . 4A , panel b , and movie S7 ) . Here , the membrane acts as an adaptable scaffold that secures and stabilizes the liquid film onto the bead . Conversely , this strategy can also be used to prevent contact between the bead and water : If the bead is covered with a silicone oil – wicked oleophilic membrane ( a PVDF - HFP membrane ) , itssurfaceinheritsboththeimmisciblecharacterandlowsurfaceenergyofoil . After the bead is withdrawnfromthebath , nowatertraceremains atthe bead surface ( Fig . 4A , panel c , and movies S8and S9 ) . Wenowshowhowstretchabilitycan be combined with electrical function ( fig . S7 ) . In Fig . 4B , we affix 100 - nm - thick gold paths to a wicked PVDF - HFP membrane to design an ele - mentary electronic circuit . A LED is powered through the metallic tracks that follow the de - formation of the membrane . When the mem - brane is compressed , the tracks are localized in themembranereservoirs . Uponextension , these tracksareunfolded , thusexhibitingconductivity throughout a factor of 8 extension - compression cycle ( 16 ) ( Fig . 4B and movie S10 ) . The use of membrane reservoirs to fuel large shape changes is encountered in a variety of animal cells . Our results show that capillarity - induced folding in thin wicked membranes en - dowsconventionalmaterialswithlargeeffectivestretchabilityandconformability , and thereby constitutes a promising tool for the design of soft deformable materials .

Conformability and stretchability for chemical and electrical functionalization of the wicked membrane . ( A ) Without previous treatment ( a ) , a clean zircon bead is dipped in a dyed water bath and subsequently pulled out . A water film is drawn at the bead surface , and because water only partially wets zircon , it rapidly disintegrates into droplets . A dry hydrophilic PAN membrane ( b ) is now applied on the bead and the experiment is repeated . After dipping and extracting the bead around 10 times , water has percolated through the membrane , and the bead is coated with a fairly homogeneous dyed water film , the PAN membrane adapts to the bead surface and secures the water film , thus providing a hydrophilic surface treatment . The bead is now covered with a silicone oil – wicked PVDF - HFP membrane ( c ) , which acts as a water repellent coating ; when the bead is dipped and pulled out of the bath , no water is drawn at its surface . Diameter of the zircon bead : 1 . 5 cm . ( B ) Two 100 - nm - thick gold strips are affixed to a silicone oil – wicked PVDF - HFP membrane and are connected to a 1 . 55 - V LED .
