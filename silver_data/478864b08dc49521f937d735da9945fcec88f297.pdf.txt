As an additional control , the changes in adhesion energy after a 10 min incubation with the PKC activators phorbolester ( PMA , 100 nM ) and DiC8 ( 10 (cid:109) g / ml ) are shown . Addition of thapsigargin ( increases cytosolic calcium by blocking calcium store calcium pumps ; 0 . 3 (cid:109) M ) and thapsigargin plus PMA ( 0 . 3 (cid:109) M and 1 (cid:109) M , respectively ) also showed only a small effect on adhesion energy . this goal by fusing a myristoylation / palmitoylation se - recombinant Inp54p under conditions tested thus far , did not show hydrolytic activity toward I ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 or quence as well as a GFP tag to Inp54p , a specific 5 (cid:57) - phosphatase ( Stolz etal . , 1998 ) .

The only small elevation of PI ( 4 ) P suggests that its concentration PI , - PI ( 3 ) P , - PI ( 4 ) P , - PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 , and - PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , as well as several D - 5 phosphorylated inositol polyphosphates . is tightly regulated by a PI ( 4 ) P hydrolyzing phosphatase . When the same construct was expressed in NIH - 3T3 Mixed bilayer or micellar ( inclusion of triton ) lipid sub - strates were incubated with recombinant Inp54p for 30 fibroblasts , adhesion energy was markedly reduced ( Figure 3E ) .

Since PIP2 lipids have many structural and anchoring functions , it is not surprising that the number of PIP2 lipids in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane is higher than the number of dynamic binding interactions required to generate adhesion energy . Indeed , if PIP2 is present in a concentration range of 0 . 1 % to 5 % of inner plasma membrane bilayer lipids ( Kleinig , 1970 ; Tran et al . , 1993 ) , this would correspond to several thou - Figure 5 .
