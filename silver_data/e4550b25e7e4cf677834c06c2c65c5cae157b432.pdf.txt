Here we report the efficient reconstitution of ATP - , GTP - , cytosol - and dynamin - dependent formation of clathrin - coated vesicles in permeabilized 3T3 - L1 cells . The SH3 domains of intersectin , endophilin I , syndapin I and amphiphysin II inhibit coated - vesicle formation in vitro through interactions with membrane - associated proteins . Most of the SH3 domains tested selectively inhibit late events involving membrane fission , but the SH3A domain of intersectin uniquely inhibits intermediate events leading to the formation of constricted coated pits . These results suggest that interactions between SH3 domains and their partners function sequentially in endocytic coated - vesicle formation . eceptor - mediated endocytosis is driven by the assembly of clathrin and AP2 protein complexes , and appears to be regu - lated by a surprisingly diverse array of accessory proteins . One such protein is the GTPase dynamin , which is targeted to the necks of endocytic coated pits and regulates the fission reaction that leads to clathrin - coated vesicle ( CCV ) formation 1 , 2 . More recently , a number of Src - homology - 3 ( SH3 ) domain - containing proteins have been identified that interact with the carboxy - terminal pro - line / arginine - rich domain ( PRD ) of dynamin . They include amphiphysin I ( ref . 3 ) , amphiphysin II ( refs 4 , 5 ) , endophilin 6 , 7 , intersectin 8 – 10 , syndapin I ( ref . 11 ) and the signalling molecule Grb2 ( ref . 12 ) . Several of these proteins also bind equally well or better to synaptojanin , an inositol 5 - phosphatase with a C - terminal PRD that co - localizes with dynamin in nerve terminals 13 . Although these interactions imply a role for SH3 - domain proteins in endocytosis , many of these proteins also bind synapsin I ( ref . 14 ) , a protein that functions in synaptic - vesicle exocytosis . The function of these pro - teins in membrane trafficking remains to be determined . Amphiphysin I and II , the best studied among these SH3 - domain - containing proteins , form dimers that bind to the coat constituents , clathrin and AP2 , suggesting that they may target dynamin to the clathrin lattice 15 . Indeed , microinjection or the transient overexpression of the SH3 domain of amphiphysin blocks endocytosis in both neuronal 16 and non - neuronal cells 17 . Another recently identified protein implicated in endocytosis is Drosophila Dap160 ( ref . 8 ) . Its vertebrate homologue intersectin 9 , 10 contains five C - terminal SH3 domains , a central coiled - coil region and two amino - terminal Eps15 - homology ( EH ) domains , which also medi - ate protein – protein interactions 18 . The preponderance of protein - interaction domains in intersectin , and its localization at sites of endocytosis , suggests that it may function as a scaffolding molecule to gather together proteins of the endocytic machinery 8 , 19 . There is much less information regarding the recently identified protein syndapin I , which interacts with N - WASP ( neuronal Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein ) and may serve as a link between the endocytic machinery and the actin cytoskeleton 11 . Endophilin’s potential role in endocytosis is also unknown . Clearly , assays that faithfully reconstitute endocytic CCV formation are needed to establish the function of these proteins . Results Efficient clathrin - coated vesicle formation in vitro . Endocytic CCV formation can be mechanistically dissected into three stages : coat assembly ; the formation of constricted coated pits ; and membrane fission to release the vesicle . Assays using isolated plasma mem - brane sheets have been developed that measure either coat assembly 20 or the detachment of previously formed coated pits 21 , 22 . All three stages of endocytic CCV formation have been reconsti - tuted in perforated A431 cells and stage - specific assays have been developed to distinguish between these various steps 23 , 24 . Early and intermediate events leading to the accumulation of transferrin ( Tfn ) receptors in constricted coated pits are detected in these assays when receptor - bound Tfn that has been biotinylated through a cleavable disulphide bond ( B - SS - Tfn ) becomes sequestered from exogenously added avidin . Constricted coated pits maintain an opening to the surface and are accessible to the small membrane - impermeant reducing agent 2 - mercaptoethane sulphonic acid ( sodium salt ) ( MesNa ) . Late events are specifically detected when the ligand is enclosed in a membrane - bound endocytic CCV and acquires resistance to MesNa . As previously reported , in perforated A431 cells , B - SS - Tfn was efficiently ( > 70 % ) sequestered into con - stricted coated pits , whereas only ~ 10 % of B - SS - Tfn was internal - ized into sealed CCVs ( Fig . 1a ) . These and other biochemical and morphological data indicated that in perforated A431 cells , clath - rin - coated pits efficiently invaginate and become constricted , but CCV formation is inefficient ( reviewed in ref . 25 ) . Similar results have been reported for COPI - and COPII - coated vesicle formation in vitro , where electron microscopic analysis reveals extensive accu - mulation of COPI - or COPII - coated buds on donor membrane fractions , but vesicle formation occurs with apparently lower efficiency 26 , 27 . We screened several cell lines and conditions of permeabiliza - tion for their ability to support efficient CCV formation in vitro and found that internalization of B - SS - Tfn into sealed CCVs was effi - ciently reconstituted in undifferentiated 3T3 - L1 cells permeabilized using liquid N 2 freeze / thaw . As can be seen ( Fig . 1a ) , > 40 % of total cell - associated B - SS - Tfn was taken up into MesNa - inaccessible , sealed endocytic vesicles , approaching the efficiency of sequestra - tion from avidin ( > 60 % ) in this system . Thus , ~ 75 % of the con - R © 1999 Macmillan Magazines Ltd © 1999 Macmillan Magazines Ltd articles 120 NATURE CELL BIOLOGY | VOL 1 | JUNE 1999 | cellbio . nature . com stricted coated pits formed in permeabilized 3T3 - L1 cells underwent fission to generate sealed CCVs . Dynamin is required for clathrin - coated vesicle formation . To con - firm that the increase in MesNa - inaccessible B - SS - Tfn obtained in 3T3 - L1 cells reflected endocytic coated - vesicle formation as it occurs in vivo , we examined the biochemical requirements for these events . Internalization of B - SS - Tfn into CCVs in permeabilized 3T3 - L1 cells required raised temperatures , and the presence of ATP and cytosol ( Fig . 1b ) . Moreover , as expected , dynamin was required for efficient CCV formation in permeabilized 3T3 - L1 cells ( Fig . 2a ) . Thus , when brain cytosol was depleted of > 99 % of its dynamin using the monoclonal antibody Hudy - 1 , which recognizes both dynamin - 1 and dynamin - 2 ( ref . 28 ) , it could support only 40 % of the level of B - SS - Tfn internalization seen with mock - depleted cytosol . The residual activity was probably due to a membrane - associated pool which could be detected by western blotting ( data not shown ) . Efficient CCV formation could be fully restored by addition of purified recombinant dynamin - 1 ( not shown ) or dynamin - 2 ( Fig . 2a ) to the dynamin - depleted cytosol . Assays performed in the presence of dynamin but the absence of cytosol resulted in only ~ 10 % of CCV formation relative to control levels ( Fig . 2a ) , indicating that although dynamin is necessary for CCV formation , it is not sufficient . This result agrees with new find - ings suggesting that dynamin does not directly mediate fission but instead functions to positively regulate the fission machinery 2 . In contrast , it has been reported that dynamin is sufficient to detach preformed and invaginated caveolae 29 and clathrin - coated pits 22 from adherent membrane fractions . However , these assays measure only very late stages in vesicle formation , and it is possible that other membrane - associated factors , already recruited to the sites of mem - brane fission , can be activated there by dynamin . To detect internal - ization in our assay , CCVs must be derived from open coated pits originally accessible to biotinylated ligand . Thus , our results suggest that fission requires the recruitment of other cytosolic components to earlier intermediates in CCV formation . Consistent with dynamin being insufficient for CCV fission , we find that GTP alone does not fully support endocytosis ( Fig . 2b ) . Previous reports on the ATP dependence of CCV formation from isolated membrane fractions have been controversial 21 , 22 ; however , our data are in agreement with Gilbert et al . 22 in that ATP is required for efficient vesicle formation ( Fig . 2b ) . Similarly , COPI and COPII vesicle formation requires GTP but is also most efficient in the pres - ence of both GTP and ATP 27 , 30 , 31 . The molecular basis for the ATP requirement in vesicle formation has not been identified , but a recently established requirement for phosphatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate in endocytic CCV formation in vitro 32 and in vivo 33 – 35 suggests a role for lipid kinases in this reaction . In sum , although it remains unclear why CCV formation is more efficiently reconstituted in 3T3 - L1 cells , the biochemical requirements for these events mirror those required for endocytosis in vivo . Similarly , extensive biochemical and morphological charac - terization of endocytic events reconstituted in perforated A431 cells establishes the validity of this model system ( refs 24 , 32 , 36 ; reviewed in ref . 25 ) . In combination , the measurement of B - SS - Tfn uptake into permeabilized 3T3 - L1 and A431 cells detected by both avidin and MesNa provides the means of dissecting the molecular events required for formation of constricted coated pits and CCVs . SH3 domains can block endocytosis in vitro . The development of robust assays that faithfully reconstitute both early events and dynamin - dependent late events in endocytic vesicle formation pro - vides the first opportunity to study SH3 - domain interactions in the functional context of receptor - mediated endocytosis , and to iden - tify the stage at which they are required . Transient transfection of cells with green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) fusion proteins encoding the SH3 domains of endophilin I , amphiphysin II or intersectin inhibited the intracellular accumulation of Tfn , establishing the physiological relevance of interactions with these SH3 - domain pro - teins in receptor - mediated endocytosis in vivo ( data not shown ) . Glutathione - S - transferase ( GST ) - fusion proteins containing these SH3 domains also strongly inhibited endocytic CCV formation in permeabilized 3T3 - L1 cells ( Fig . 3a ) . The intersectin SH3A domain was most potent ( half - maximal inhibition at ~ 4 m M ) ; the SH3 domains of amphiphysin II and syndapin I had intermediate poten - cies ( half - maximal inhibition at ~ 6 and ~ 9 µM , respectively ) ; and the endophilin I SH3 domain was least potent ( half - maximal inhi - bition at ~ 11 m M ) . Such quantitative data are helpful in under - standing the role of SH3 domain proteins in endocytosis . For example , the SH3 domain of endophilin I binds preferentially to synaptojanin as compared with dynamin 7 , 37 and the opposite is true for the SH3 domain of syndapin I ( ref . 11 ) . However , the two SH3 domains both inhibit endocytic vesicle formation with approxi - A431 cells A431 cells 3T3 - L1 cells 3T3 - L1 cells 3T3 - L1 cells B - SS - T f n s eque s t e r ed ( % o f t o t a l ) ( % o f t o t a l ) B - SS - T f n up t a k e 0 20 40 60 80 0 10 20 30 Time ( min ) 0 20 40 60 80 Temp .

The N - terminal SH3 domain of Grb2 binds both dynamin and synaptojanin in vitro ; however , this SH3 domain failed to inhibit CCV formation ( Fig . 3b ) except at very high concentrations ( half - maximal inhibition at 80 m M ) , consistent with previous reports using intact cells 17 , 38 . Whereas wild - type syndapin I SH3 domain strongly inhibited endocytic CCV formation , the Pro434Leu mutant , which fails to bind dynamin or synaptojanin 11 , was only weakly inhibitory . Finally , the c - Abl SH3 domain , which binds nei - ther dynamin nor synaptojanin 39 , failed to inhibit endocytosis , even at very high concentrations . Together these results demonstrate the specificity of the in vitro assay in terms of SH3 - domain effects . Intersectin has five SH3 domains , denoted A to E going from the N to the C terminus . In GST pulldown experiments , SH3A , - C and - E can quantitatively deplete dynamin and synaptojanin from brain extracts , whereas SH3B and - D interact weakly , if at all , with these proteins 9 . These SH3 domains have correspondingly different effects on endocytosis in permeabilized 3T3 - L1 cells ( Fig . 3c ) . SH3A was the most potent , consistent with its being the only intersectin SH3 domain able to detect dynamin or synaptojanin by blot overlay experiments 9 . SH3C and SH3E required ~ 10 m M for half - maximal inhibition , whereas SH3D failed to inhibit , and SH3B only weakly ( 10 – 20 % ) inhibited , endocytosis , even at concentrations of 100 m M ( data not shown ) . Thus the inhibitory effects of the various inter - sectin SH3 domains correlated quantitatively with their established abilities to bind dynamin and synaptojanin in brain extracts , sug - gesting that these might be the functionally relevant partners for intersectin in endocytosis . SH3 - domain effects occur at the membrane . To determine the localization of the SH3 - domain targets , GST – SH3 - domain fusions were preincubated at 4 (cid:176) C with permeabilized 3T3 - L1 cells alone , cytosol alone , or cells and cytosol together , before addition of nucleotides and incubation at 37 (cid:176) C ( see Methods ) . The results shown in Fig . 4a are for the endophilin I SH3 domain , but similar results were obtained with the SH3 domains of amphiphysin II , syndapin I and the SH3C and - E domains of intersectin ( not shown ) . When cytosol alone was preincubated with GST – SH3 domains , the extent of inhibition was negligible at intermediate Figure 3 GST – SH3 domains inhibit Tfn endocytosis in permeabilized 3T3 - L1 cells . a , Assays were performed after incubation in the presence of increasing concentrations of GST - fusion proteins containing the following SH3 domains : intersectin SH3A ( solid square ) , amphiphysin II SH3 ( diamond ) , syndapin I SH3 ( solid circle ) , endophilin I SH3 ( triangle ) or Grb2 N - SH3 ( open square ) , as described in Methods . b , Inhibition of CCV formation in the presence of syndapin I GST – SH3 ( solid square ) , the syndapin I GST – SH3 point mutation P434L ( triangle ) 11 or c - Abl GST – SH3 ( open circle ) . c , Inhibition of CCV formation in the presence of the individual SH3 domains from intersectin .

Maximal inhibition of endocytic CCV formation required preincu - bation of SH3 domains with permeabilized membranes before addition of cytosol and incubation at 37 (cid:176) C , demonstrating that the functional pools of binding partners for the SH3 - domain proteins are at the membrane . The presence of cytosol during preincubations with membrane fractions did not neutralize the inhibitory effects of the SH3 domains tested . Because endocytosis requires a cytosolic pool of dynamin , our results show that these SH3 domains were unable to functionally interfere with dynamin ( or other potential partners ) in the cytosolic pool . This inability could reflect different conforma - tional states of partner proteins in the two pools , differential mask - ing of SH3 - binding sites and / or differential phosphorylation of the membrane and cytosolic pools , as has been reported for dynamin - 1 ( ref . 40 ) . Together , these data suggest that SH3 - domain interac - tions are spatially and temporally regulated , and that interactions with membrane - associated binding partner ( s ) are functionally rel - evant for endocytic coated - vesicle formation . The behaviour of the SH3A domain of intersectin in this assay was distinct in one respect from that of all other SH3 domains tested ( Fig . 4b ) . As with the other SH3 domains , maximal inhibi - tion required preincubation with permeabilized membranes , indi - cating that interactions critical for interference with endocytosis occurred at the membrane . However , if cytosol was included in the preincubation period , then the extent of inhibition was significantly reduced . Thus , unlike the other SH3 domains , interactions with binding partners in the cytosol can neutralize the inhibitory effects of the intersectin SH3A domain . SH3 domains inhibit CCV formation at distinct stages . To deter - mine the stage at which CCV formation is blocked by SH3 - domain interactions , we compared the effects of various SH3 domains in perforated A431 cells and permeabilized 3T3 - L1 cells using avidin inaccessibility to detect both B - SS - Tfn sequestration into con - stricted coated pits and its internalization into sealed coated vesi - cles . As with 3T3 - L1 cells , the SH3 domains completely abolished the internalization of B - SS - Tfn into MesNa - resistant CCV in perfo - rated A431 cells ( not shown ) . Again , the inhibitory effects of the intersectin SH3A domain were strikingly different from those of the other SH3 domains ( Fig . 5 ) . The intersectin SH3A domain strongly inhibited the avidin - inaccessible signal in both A431 cells and 3T3 - L1 cells to background levels ( Fig . 5 ) . In contrast , the avidin - inac - cessible signal was only partially inhibited by the syndapin I SH3 domain ( Fig . 5 ) , intersectin SH3C and - E or the SH3 domains from endophilin I and amphiphysin II ( not shown ) . Because early events in CCV formation are more efficiently reconstituted in perforated A431 cells , ~ 80 % of the total avidin - inaccessible signal obtained in this system reflects the sequestration of B - SS - Tfn into constricted coated pits ( Figs 2a , 6 ) . By contrast , only ~ 25 % of the total avidin - inaccessible signal obtained in permeabilized 3T3 - L1 cells reflects the accumulation of B - SS - Tfn in constricted coated pits . For both membrane preparations , the residual signal resistant to inhibition by SH3 domains corresponded to the fraction of activity that results from the accumulation of constricted coated pits . These data sug - gest that the interaction of the intersectin SH3 domain with one of its partners is required for early events leading to the formation of constricted coated pits , and that the other SH3 domains preferen - tially inhibit late events leading to CCV fission . Our results suggest that the formation of constricted coated pits and the formation of coated vesicles are independently reconsti - tuted in vitro . Earlier analysis of CCV formation in perforated A431 cells ( refs 23 , 24 , 36 ; for review see ref . 25 ) led to a model proposing that endocytic coated vesicles formed in vitro are exclusively derived from a subset of ‘fission - competent’ coated pits already assembled ( and primed ? ) in vivo ( Fig . 6 , model 1 , pathway B ) . Coated pits that assemble efficiently de novo on membrane preparations become constricted but do not undergo fission 24 , 41 ( Fig . 6 , model 1 , pathway A ) . In this model , a constricted coated pit is an obligate intermedi - ate to CCV formation . Although the structural correlate to a con - stricted coated pit has not been identified , this operationally defined intermediate has been detected in vivo under conditions of ATP depletion 42 .

Assays were performed in permeabilized A431 cells ( solid symbols ) or 3T3 - L1 cells ( open symbols ) in the presence of increasing concentrations of GST – syndapin I SH3 domain ( squares ) or GST – intersectin SH3A domain ( circles ) as described in Methods .

Constricted coated pit formation and coated - vesicle fission are independently reconstituted in permeabilized cells , enabling the development of stage - specific assays for CCV formation . Two models are presented , both of which are consistent with the available data . In model 1 , flat clathrin lattices formed in vitro become constricted coated pits but fail to detach ( A ) . Alternatively , ‘fission - competent’ coated pits 23 ( indicated by an asterisk ) , preassembled in vivo , undergo constriction and detachment to form coated vesicles ( B ) . In model 2 , coated pits assembled in vitro or in vivo either form constricted coated pits that fail to bud ( A : a dead - end pathway ) or form coated vesicles by a mechanism in which constricted coated pits are not a stable intermediate ( B ) . Although biochemically identical events are reconstituted using membrane preparations from A431 and 3T3 - L1 cells , the relative contributions of the two independent , parallel or divergent , pathways to the overall signal vary , as indicated in the table . Most SH3 domains , including that from syndapin I , appear to selectively inhibit the B pathways , whereas the intersectin SH3A domain inhibits an early event along both pathways .

This led us to consider a second model for endocytic CCV formation in vitro ( Fig . 6 , model 2 ) . In this model , the constricted coated pit is not an obligate stable intermediate in CCV formation and instead accumulates only under artificially induced conditions . Resolution of these two models will require further biochemical and morpho - logical analysis in vivo and in vitro . Significantly , the biochemical requirements for formation of these endocytic intermediates in vitro mirror those required for endocytosis in vivo . Moreover , membrane preparations from the two cell lines behave qualitatively the same and differ only quantitatively in the relative contributions of the two pathways to the total endocytic events ( Fig . 6 ) . Discussion We have directly demonstrated a role for SH3 - domain - mediated interactions with syndapin I , amphiphysin II and intersectin in endocytosis . Dynamin is a likely target for the inhibitory effects of these SH3 domains because it binds to all these proteins and is required for late events in CCV formation . Most of the SH3 domains tested in our study inhibit through interaction with a membrane - associated partner ( s ) and our evidence supports the existence of a functionally active pool of dynamin on the mem - brane . However , dynamin is unlikely to be the only relevant part - ner : the endophilin I SH3 domain , which binds dynamin only weakly , is an equally potent inhibitor of endocytosis . These inhibi - tory effects could be due to interference with synaptojanin , its main binding partner . The SH3A domain of intersectin was unique among the SH3 domains tested in several ways . It was the most potent inhibitor of endocytosis ; its inhibitory effects could be competed with excess cytosol ; and it inhibited the formation of constricted coated pits . These qualitatively different properties of the SH3A domain may reflect its interactions with partners other than dynamin and synap - tojanin . Intersectin GST - pulldown experiments have shown that SH3A binds several as yet unidentified partners that are not bound by the other SH3 domains of intersectin ( B . K . K and P . S . M , unpub - lished ) . Moreover , the four SH3 domains of the Drosophila homo - logue Dap160 also have different ligand specificities 8 . Together these results suggest a complex and dynamic function for intersec - tin SH3 - domain interactions in endocytosis . Many of the SH3 - domain proteins have multiple protein - inter - action domains and interact with other components of the endo - cytic machinery as well as with components of the actin cytoskeleton . It has been proposed that these ‘scaffolding’ interac - tions serve to establish endocytic ‘hot - spots’ which have been observed at presynaptic nerve terminals 11 , 43 , 44 and , more recently , in non - neuronal cells using GFP – clathrin 45 . Many of the SH3 - domain interactions seem to be involved at late stages in vesicle formation . These late events are the most difficult to reconstitute in vitro , per - haps reflecting the molecular complexity of membrane fission and vesicle formation and / or constraints placed on vesicle formation by the cortical cytoskeleton . Thus , it is possible that instead of , or in addition to , marking sites suitable for coated - pit assembly , endo - cytic hot - spots mark sites suitable for CCV release . In this context , temporally and spatially controlled interactions mediated by SH3 - domain proteins might function sequentially to coordinate coated - pit assembly , membrane fission and release of vesicles through the cell cortex . Resolution of these issues will require reconstitution of the full - length SH3 - domain proteins in functional assays , such as those described here , for the formation of endocytic coated vesicles . h Methods Cells and reagents . Human adenocarcinoma A431 cells were cultured as previously described 23 . Undifferentiated mouse 3T3 - L1 adipocytes were a gift from S . van Delft and A . J . Verkleij and were cultured on 150 - mm tissue culture plates in DMEM containing 10 % Hyclone FCS and penicillin / streptomycin and maintained at 50 to 80 % confluency . Cells were trypsinized 20 h before use with a maximum trypsinization time of 1 min , and seeded so that they were 80 – 90 % confluent . After retrieval from liquid nitrogen storage , cells must be maintained in culture for a minimum of 2 weeks before use . GST - fusion proteins encoding the SH3 domain of intersectin 9 , endophilin I ( ref . 46 ) , syndapin I ( ref . 11 ) and amphiphysin II ( ref . 5 ) were prepared as previously described . They were then concentrated and exchanged into KSHM assay buffer ( 100 mM potassium acetate , 85 mM sucrose , 20 mM HEPES , 1 mM magnesium acetate , pH 7 . 4 ) using Centriplus Concentrators ( Amicon ) before use . Rat brain cytosol was prepared by dicing 20 snap - frozen rat brains ( PelFreeze ) into small pieces with a razor blade followed by homogenization in 2 vols KSHM using a Dounce homogenizer and 10 passes each of the A and B pestles . The homogenate was centrifuged at 10 , 000 g for 15 min and the supernatant subjected to a second centrifugation in a Ti45 rotor ( Beckman Instruments ) at 100 , 000 g for 1 h . Cytosol aliquots were rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at - 70 (cid:176) C for up to 3 months . Sheep anti - transferrin antibody was a gift from the Scottish Antibody Production Unit . Nucleotides were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim . Diferric human transferrin ( Sigma ) was biotinylated using NHS - SS - biotin ( Pierce ) as described 36 . Perforated cell assays for formation of endocytic coated vesicles . The in vitro internalization assay using perforated A431 cells was performed essentially as described 23 , 36 with minor modifications 32 . To prepare permeabilized 3T3 - L1 cells , two 150 - mm dishes were washed five times in KSHM buffer , drained of excess buffer , frozen by submerging in liquid N 2 and rapidly thawed by floating in a 37 (cid:176) C waterbath . The cells were then scraped from the dish and washed for 15 min by rocking at 4 (cid:176) C in 15 ml KSHM before recovery using low - speed centrifugation ( 800 g for 3 min ) . Permeabilized cells ( > 90 % permeabilized as assessed by Trypan blue ) were resuspended at ~ 10 7 cells ml - 1 in KSHM containing 0 . 8 % BSA and 8 m g ml - 1 B - SS - Tfn and left for 15 min at 4 (cid:176) C before dispensing 10 m l of the cell suspension to eppendorf tubes containing the other reagents . Each assay typically contained an ATP - regenerating system 23 , 40 m M GTP , 150 – 300 m g cytosol ( or BSA equivalent , for controls ) in 40 m l final volume . Tubes were mixed gently and transferred to a 37 (cid:176) C waterbath for 20 min before returning to ice . After incubation the assay was washed by addition of 500 m l ice - cold KSHM + 1 % BSA , then spun at 10 , 000 g . Supernatants were carefully aspirated and the pellets were processed to detect avidin - inaccessible or MesNa - resistant B - SS - Tfn using an ELISA - based assay exactly as described 36 . Each assay point was performed in duplicate . For SH3 - domain - inhibition experiments , permeabilized cells were preincubated with SH3 domains in 30 m l total volume for 15 min , submerged on ice . Cytosol and nucleotides were added , and the cells were incubated at 37 (cid:176) C for 20 min to allow for endocytosis . In some cases cytosol was preincubated separately with SH3 domains before addition of cells , or both cytosol and cells were preincubated together . Dynamin depletion and rescue . Hudy - 1 monoclonal antibody ( 3 mg ) 47 was crosslinked to 1 ml Protein G – Sepharose using DTSSP as described 48 . The matrix was equilibrated in KSHM and drained of all excess buffer before use . Rat brain cytosol was incubated with 0 . 5 ml of the affinity matrix for 1 h on ice . The matrix was spun and the cytosol reincubated with the remaining 0 . 5 ml of the affinity matrix . To control for dilution and nonspecific depletion , mock - treated cytosol was prepared by passing the cytosol over rabbit anti - mouse IgG - conjugated matrix . Rescue experiments were performed by adding 10 – 40 m g purified recombinant dynamin - 1 or - 2 , prepared as described 49 , 50 . The dynamin - only assays were performed as described , but the cytosol was replaced with an equivalent concentration of BSA .
