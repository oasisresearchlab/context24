To that end , we have used the web - based testbed of the Problem Map ( P - map ) computational framework which represents designers’ problem formulation in terms of a series of state models , where each state consists of six types of entities in addition to relations within and between different entity types . We gave two design problems to twenty five graduate students in an advanced product design course . We collected their problem formulation data in the P - map testbed and their ideation data through concept sketches . We conducted correlation analysis between variables extracted from the P - maps , and the ideation metrics . We also built regression models for each of the ideation metrics as the dependent variable , and the P - map variables as the independent variables . We used the data from the first problem to predict the ideation scores for the second problem . The predicted results were compared to the actual outcome reported by an independent panel of judges . Models of variety , average and max quality had more accurate predictions while average novelty , average and max quality had statistically more reliable models . 1 . INTRODUCTION Problem formulation is an important part of the design process which has major influences on the design outcome . Yet , this effect is not well understood [ 1 ] . The main objective of our research is to understand the role of problem formulation in creative design . To that end , we have developed the Problem Map ( P - map ) framework [ 2 ] . It is a computational framework which facilitates the representation and comparison of designers’ problem formulation , in the form of a series of state models . The states show data fragments under six entities ( requirements , use scenarios , functions , artifacts , behaviors , and issues ) , a hierarchical structure within each category ( entity type ) , and relations among the categories . A node - link representation similar to Concept maps [ 3 ] provides a convenient way to see a designer’s thinking process over time , in addition to comparing different designers approach towards formulating a problem [ 4 ] . The formalized and bounded structure of P - map ( limited number of categories to choose , and defined relation types ) also makes it possible to measure different characteristics of designers’ problem formulation , by extracting different types of variables , e . g . , the total number of requirements , or the entity type that is mostly expressed in the last quarter of a designing session . In this paper , we investigate the relation between problem formulation , measured with the aforementioned P - map characteristic variables , and ideation , evaluated by the ideation effectiveness metrics [ 5 ] . With data collected from students of a design course working on two design problems , we conduct correlation analyses as well as building linear regression models to reveal patterns of creative designing . Using P - map data as independent variables and ideation metrics as dependent variables in the linear regression model built for the first problem , we also predict the outcomes of the second design problem given its P - map data . We evaluate the accuracy and the precision of our predictions compared to the actual assessments 2 Copyright © 2015 by ASME made by an independent panel of judges . We also locate our results in discoveries from the literature to find similarities or differences . Therefore , we should review the literature first . 2 . REVIEW OF PAST WORK 2 . 1 . Relevant findings from empirical studies of conceptual design A detailed review of relevant findings from empirical studies of conceptual design is beyond the scope of this paper . A recent comprehensive review on empirical studies in designer thinking can be found at [ 6 ] . Here , we focus on a few strategies that designers adopt during the early stages of conceptual design : depth or breadth first exploration of the design space , role of abstraction , and order and direction in decomposing the design space . We should state that because of the well - received notion of the co - evolution of the problem and solution spaces [ 7 , 8 ] , we take the liberty of not finding a clear distinction between problem and solution spaces ; therefore , we interchangeably use the terms design space , and problem - solution spaces . A few studies that have looked at the differences between expert and novice designers provide examples for the strategies that designers use . Ho [ 9 ] have found that expert designers approach directly the main goals and work backward for required knowledge . One can infer a depth - first exploration from this observation . Contrarily , Ball et al . [ 10 ] have conducted a protocol study where they have observed experts use more breadth - first search while novices use depth - first search in ideation . However , they also report that experts utilize a strategic knowledge about how to conduct the design process effectively when they face impasses , by switching from a predominantly breadth - first mode of problem solving to an opportunistic depth - first mode . In another protocol study with three subjects Cai , Do , and Zimring [ 11 ] have found no relation between creative outcome and depth vs . breadth exploration of the design space . Another influencing strategic behavior in conceptual design is abstraction . Ward , Patterson , and Sifonis [ 12 ] have conducted experiments to investigate the role of abstraction in creative ideation . By actively instructing the participants to formulate the given task in either very specific or more abstract ways , they found that the latter instructions led to more novel ideas . Ball , Ormerod , and Morley [ 13 ] have found that experts lean on experiential abstract knowledge while novices rely on case - driven analogies , mainly driven by surface - level cues . Problem decomposition is another designerly behavior that can affect conceptual design . Liikanen and Perttula [ 14 ] have analyzed the prevalence of explicit and implicit problem decomposition modes through a protocol study involving 16 senior students of mechanical engineering . They have found that the subjects implicitly employ top – down problem decomposition while explicit decomposition is rarely used and often does not foster creativity . In contrast , Ho [ 9 ] have found that expert designers are more likely to utilize explicit problem decomposition , leading to more creative ideas . 2 . 2 . Relevant applications of search for patterns , modeling , and prediction We have already explained how our P - map framework benefits from a node - link representation inspired by concept maps . We have found the work of Oxman on Think maps [ 15 ] to be similar to ours in using concept maps . However , it does not exploit the computational framework in search for patterns in the way we do , perhaps because the objective of the framework is strictly comparing students’ maps to that of a teacher or a norm . While we have applied P - maps for similar purposes [ 16 ] , we find more ways in benefiting from such a computational framework , one of which we present in this paper . One of the established works in using a simpler computational framework compared to concept maps , has been the linkography of Goldschmidt [ 17 ] where she has used a node - link representation for capturing the problem space at the fuzzy front end of product design . States in the problem space are described as nodes and operators as links among them . The result is a network that resembles a semantic network , but the structure of a state is not clearly specified ; each state represents the problem space at a time with one node . In contrast , our P - map representation shows each state at a time with a network of nodes of different types , adding more specificity and clarity to the representation of the problem space , and in turn facilitating a finer - grained means for comparing different designers’ approaches to the formulation of a problem [ 4 ] . Cai , Do , and Zimring [ 11 ] have developed an extension of linkography in addition to a distance graph to investigate design patterns among designers of different expertise levels and exposure to different stimuli . They modify the definition of links based on lateral transformation and vertical transformation to represent both the breadth and the depth of the problem space explored in design . In lateral transformation the movement is from one idea to an alternative . In a vertical transformation the move is from one idea to a more detailed or elaborated version of the same idea . They report that the more creative the design is , the higher number of alternatives and more chucks and webs are displayed in their representation , the extended linkograph . A different application of linkography in finding patterns in conceptual design , Kan and Gero [ 18 ] conduct protocol studies to acquire information from linkographs . They define two methods to abstract information from the linkographs : one based on clustering , and one based on Shannon ' s entropy measure . They state that cluster analysis is able to group the linkographs into meaningful clusters , while entropy measures the opportunities for idea development . There have also been efforts in combining the different representations and search methods that we described above . An example is Hao et al . [ 19 ] where they extend previous research on concept map assessment , to develop an evaluation metric in order to predict individuals ' problem - solving performance . They 3 Copyright © 2015 by ASME propose their EntropyAvg novelty metric based on the Shannon’s entropy in information theory . They have conducted a controlled experiment where they find a strong correlation between individuals ' problem - solving performance and their EntropyAvg measure . 3 . DATA COLLECTION 3 . 1 . Subjects Twenty five graduate students in an advanced product design course were the subjects of this study . Since the students had different educational backgrounds , we had them take the Divergent Thinking skill test [ 20 ] to have a gauge of conceptual design skill level among our sample subjects . The results suggest a distribution similar to that of 2000 students who had previously taken the test ; hence an appropriate representation of individuals’ conceptual design skill levels from the sample at hand ; see Figure 1 . In addition to conceptual design skills , the course syllabus consisted of guidelines for embodiment design ( form synthesis , material selection , failure modes ) , GD & T , model - based design ( behavior models such as Modelica , kinematics ) , and optimization and utility theory . The course prepared the students for taking on two design projects which were assigned in the second half of the semester . The projects are explained in the following section .

Distribution of the Divergent Thinking test [ 6 ] scores among the students in this study compared to a norm population 3 . 2 . Design problems Two design problems were given to the students . The first design problem—D1—was to design the shot buddy ( a design problem from [ 21 ] ) ; a device which could return shot basketballs to the shooter , whether the basket was made or missed . The device must be able to automatically adjust the return angle based on the position of the shooter when the ball is shot . The shooter may be initially located anywhere within a 25 ' semicircle with respect to the basket . It must also accurately and quickly return balls to the shooter and not block the shooters access to the basket . Ideally , the return speed would be adjustable to accommodate different skill levels . The device should be user friendly for kids ages 10 - 18 , easy to setup and applicable to a wide variety of basket types . The device should be affordable for the average family . The second design problem—D2—was to design an autonomous surveillance vehicle to automatically and periodically tour the perimeter of two structures , stopping as close as possible to the start point , see Figure 2 . Figure 2 . The settings for the D2 challenge problem 3 . 3 . Characteristics of the data set For each of the two assigned design problems , different types of data were collected corresponding to different steps of the design process . This study involves two steps : problem formulation , and ideation . For problem formulation , students were asked to express their thoughts within the P - map framework , using the Problem Formulator web - based tool [ 22 ] . The input data in the tool was short phrases of text put under one of the six entities . These fragments could then be put in a hierarchy within each category , or be related to fragments of other categories . Examples from the data collected for the shot buddy problem ( D1 ) include requirement “withstand impacts from the basketball” , use scenario “outdoor environment” which has the children entities “rain / moisture” and “sunlight” , function “collect ball” which is related to behavior “impact force” , artifact “funnel” , and issue “Is there a minimum distance from the net the shooter needs to be able to shoot ? ” . Different measures can be defined and computed for the collected data . In this paper , we utilize two ways of measuring the problem formulation data . The first one is basically different types of counts of the final state of the P - map ; we call these P - map state counts . An example of a P - map state count is the total number of expressed functions . A variety of state count variables can be defined , but in order to avoid the curse of dimensionality , we limit ourselves to the counts of each entity ( six variables ) , in addition to counts of isolated entities ( entities in each category that are not part of a hierarchy , i . e . , entities with no parents and children ; six variables ) , and counts of disconnected entities ( entities that are not related to other categories ; six variables ) . The second type of P - map variables count traces of specific series of actions which constitute certain problem formulation strategies . An example of a strategy is the tendency to abstract 4 Copyright © 2015 by ASME ideas . When thinking about an aspect of the problem , a designer can either explore details or sub - types of an aspect , or a more general idea about that aspect . The latter ability , abstraction , is considered to influence creative idea generation [ 12 ] . Table 1 summarizes five different strategies , whose traces were counted for the collected P - map data . Table 1 . List of formulation strategies traced in P - maps Strategy Definition Conditions Abstraction The designer refers to a more abstract aspect of the problem or solution  Entity parent added at time t1  Entity child added at time t2  t1 > t2 Entity depth prevalence The designer develops details of an aspect of the design before looking for its relations to other categories  Entity parent of type A added at time t1  Entity child of type A added at time t2  Entity of type B added at time t3  Entity of type B related to parent entity of type A at time t4  t4 > t2 Order req _ use The designer follows a specific order adding use scenarios after all related requirements  A requirement is added at time t1  A use scenario is related to the requirement at time t2  Entity of other type added at time t3 and related to the requirement at time t4  t2 < t3 < t4 Order req _ fun The designer follows a specific order adding functions after all related requirements  A requirement is added at time t1  A function is related to the requirement at time t2  Entity of other type added at time t3 and related to the requirement at time t4  t2 < t3 < t4 Conflict identification The designer identifies an issue about conflicting requirements  Requirement R1 is added at time t1  Requirement R2 is added at time t2  Issue I1 is added at time t3  I1 is related to R1 and R2 To evaluate the outcome of the ideation step , sketches were collected from the students and scored with respect to the measures of ideation effectiveness [ 5 ] : quantity , variety , average and max novelty , average and max quality . For each design problem , a few high level functions were chosen and judges would identify the solution concepts for each function within each sketch . For the D1 problem , the functions were control - move , collect , store - guide , locate , aim , and return ; wheels , funnel , rail , optical sensor , revolving barrel , and spring cannon are examples of each function respectively . For the D2 problem , the functions were move , start , control direction , steer , and stop ; propeller , power switch , cam , rudder , and anchor are examples of each function respectively . To reduce bias , different judges evaluated the sketches for the D1 and D2 problems . 4 . RESULTS AND ANALYSES To investigate the relation between problem formulation and ideation , first we conducted correlation analysis between the P - map variables and the ideation metrics . Second , we built regression models with each of the ideation metrics as the dependent variable and the P - map variables as the regressors ( independent variables ) . Third , with the models based on the D1 problem , we predicted the ideation scores for D2 . The prediction results were compared to the actual metrics that were computed from the assessment of conceptual design sketches by an independent panel of judges . 4 . 1 . Correlation analysis A correlation study was conducted to find significant correlations between P - map variables and ideation metrics for problems D1 and D2 . For the twenty five data points that were collected from the students ( one record per student for each set of formulation input and ideation output ) correlation coefficients of magnitude 0 . 34 ( less than - 0 . 34 and more than 0 . 34 ) were statistically significant , with 95 % confidence . The significant correlations between problem formulation measures and ideation metrics for the D1 and D2 problems are shown in Table 2 . Correlations that have a similar trend in both problems are shown Table 3 . The results for problem D1 show a positive correlation between quantity and the number of raised issues , isolated artifacts , and isolated issues . One can infer that leaving artifacts and issues in a flat list , i . e . , not focusing on the architecture of the final product or organizing the issues lead to generating more ideas . There is also a high correlation between all five strategies except for entity depth prevalence and quantity ; breadth expansion breeds quantity . Having more issues in a flat list has a moderate positive correlation with variety as well . In addition , the more abstraction and conflict identification happened , the more likely it was for the students to come up with different types of concept solutions . Correlation results for both average and max novelty show that the more the use scenarios were left unorganized , the less the possibility of having original ideas . 5 Copyright © 2015 by ASME Additionally , higher rates of entity depth expansion led to more novel ideas ; in other words , the more the students developed an entity before searching for ( or being reminded of ) related entities in other categories , the more likely it was to propose novel solutions . Finally , students came up with solutions of higher quality when they did consider the relations between issues and other entity types . Best quality of solutions occurred when students did not fail in recognizing the relations between elicited requirements and other entity types , and when they identified conflicting requirements . Table 2 . Significant correlations between problem formulation measures and ideation outcome for D1 and D2 Ideation metric D1 D2 Quantity  Isolated artifacts 0 . 34  Abstraction 0 . 40  Conflict identification 0 . 43  Function 0 . 38  Disconnected artifact - 0 . 40  Entity depth prevalence 0 . 53 Variety  Abstraction 0 . 40  Conflict identification 0 . 42  Order req _ use 0 . 35 Avg . novelty  Entity depth prevalence 0 . 42  Disconnected function - 0 . 41  Conflict identification 0 . 42 Max novelty  Isolated use scenario - 0 . 35  Entity depth prevalence 0 . 40  Disconnected function - 0 . 38  Disconnected artifact - 0 . 37 Avg . quality  Disconnected issues - 0 . 35  Behavior 0 . 38  Isolated use scenario - 0 . 35 Max quality  Disconnected requirements - 0 . 48  Conflict identification 0 . 40 The results for the D2 problem show a few different significant correlations . The total number of identified functions has a moderate positive correlation with variety . The degree to which students made abstractions and found conflicts also have substantial correlations to variety too . An interesting difference between the correlations for the two problems is that entity depth prevalence is positively correlated with average and max novelty . As we will discuss later , the progression of class over time , and the more constrained nature of the second problem resulted in an overall lower variability in the novelty of the students . It is plausible to infer that a more constrained problem requires more focus on each category of entities prior to the designer’s shifting attention towards a different category , i . e . , within - group depth exploration breeds novelty in more constrained problems . However , this does not contradict with the observation that the more the students failed in organizing the entities within each category and recognizing the relations to entities in other categories , the worse their ideas were in terms of novelty and quality .

Regression analysis To have an understanding of how different variables in the problem formulation together influence ideation metrics , we conducted regression analysis . First , a model was built with P - map state variables as the input variables , and each of the corresponding ideation metrics as the output . Separately , a model was built for the number of times different strategies were utilized during problem formulation with respect to the ideation results . Table 4 and Table 5 show the coefficients of regression for the P - map state variable counts and counts occurrences of strategies respectively . Significant regressors are shown in bold in Table 4 and Table 5 . Since this study is in its early stages , the criterion for choosing significant regressors was set not to be too strict . For P - map state counts , a p value below 0 . 2 was considered significant ; for P - map strategies counts , the bound was set at 0 . 1 . If there were no p values below the set limit , the lowest p value was considered significant ( those regressors are starred in the tables ) . Additionally , regressors that have the same sign in the models for the two problems are italicized . This comparison shows if both problems provide models that can have the same sense with respect to some variables , i . e . , if some parts of the models are generalizable and insensitive to the problem . Among the P - map state counts models , average quality has the highest number of variables with similar signs for D1 and D2 ( 13 ) while max quality and variety have 4 and 5 similar variables . One can infer that average quality is easier to predict for new problems . 4 . 3 . Prediction results In order to test how accurate the regression models were in predicting new observations for new problems , data for one problem was taken as a training set and for the other as a test set . We predicted the ideation metrics for the D2 problem based on the regression models of the D1 problem . The structure of the collected data for both problems was the same . For problem formulation , P - map state counts and occurrences of strategies were obtained from the Formulator tool . Concept sketches were assessed by a panel of judges different from the one which assessed sketches of problem D1 . For each student , the problem formulation data from D2 was fed into the three models build based on D1 . We recorded the difference between the actual 6 Copyright © 2015 by ASME ideation scores , and the predicted outcomes from the three models . Table 6 summarizes how accurately the models for D1 predicted each of the ideation metrics for D2 . Since the ideation metrics have normalized scores ( on a scale of 1 - 10 ) , we counted the number of observations which were predicted within 1 or 2 units ( 10 % or 20 % margin of error ) . It can be seen that predictions of variety , average and max quality were highly accurate in models based on state counts and strategies . The strategies counts model is slightly more accurate in predicting quantity , average novelty , and average quality ( within 10 % margin of error ) . Table 4 .

DISCUSSION This section discusses some of the challenges that we have faced in providing a model that can predict ideation outcome from the characteristics of designers’ problem formulation . We also show some statistical measures that we have used to test the reliability of the predicting linear regression models . Additionally , we examine components of the linear models as well as the correlation coefficients that were presented in section ‎4 . 1 in order to see if we can find an agreement between our observations and previous findings in the literature . 5 . 1 . Challenges in data collection We faced three major problems in the way that data was collected . The first challenge related to the difficulties that we experienced in using the data collection tool , the web - based Problem Formulator [ 22 ] . Similar to any software tool there is a learning curve . Prior to working on the two problems which we used in this study , the students learned about the tool and its underlying ontology in an hour long workshop , in addition to working on a different practice design problem . Yet , we saw that some students still misused the tool in entering fragments under the wrong categories . Another common mistake was to mistake conjunctive relations with disjunctive relations ( which mean alternatives ) under a parent node . A part of our ongoing work is to embed a pre - verification system in the tool where users will be prompted to correct their entries , or a more appropriate category is suggested by the tool . Another challenge in this study was the limitations of selecting appropriate design problems . Even though the ideation metrics have a normalized scoring schema with respect to either a historical pool from previous designs for the same problem , or the sample of designers’ concepts at hand , it is difficult to find two problems which lead to ideation outcomes of the same distribution of scores . Some problems , by the inherent constraints that they have , lead to less ideas with less variety in the proposed solutions , which in turn lowers the chance of having high scores of novelty . Figure 3 shows the changes in the variety scores of the students for the D1 and D2 problems . Even though the median remains fairly the same in both problems , the distribution is much narrower in the variety scores of D2 compared to D1 . Figure 4 shows how average novelty goes down from D1 to D2 , mainly because the second problem was more constrained since the students were asked to build a working prototype to compete with other students . It is plausible to assume that the students became more conservative in proposing their designs merely due to the fact that they were subconsciously searching for a design that worked .

Decreasing mean and variability of average novelty scores from D1 to D2 The challenge in problem selection is coupled with the nature of a progressing class of students throughout a semester in further lowering the variation in outcomes . As the class progressed , through multiple assignments and design projects , the students design skills improved , resulting in a convergence in some of the ideation metrics from D1 to D2 . An alternative interpretation of Figure 4 is that it was less likely to come up with a novel idea when students’ level of competence had become close . 5 . 2 . Reliability of the results In order to inspect how reliable the results were , we conducted statistical tests . We have already mentioned in section ‎4 . 1 that the correlation coefficients above 0 . 34 were considered statistically significant for 25 observations with 95 % confidence ( p < 0 . 05 ) . For the regression models , two statistical 8 Copyright © 2015 by ASME tests were used . One was the test of the hypotheses that the coefficients were 0 , i . e . , the input variable did not have a linear effect on the output . For this test , the ratio of the coefficient over its standard error , the T statistic , is compared to a Students’ t distribution for the same number of observations , and p values are derived . We explained earlier in section ‎4 . 2 how we determined which p values to consider . The other statistic that we checked for each model was the R - squared value . The R - squared of the regression is the degree to which the variation in the output variable is accounted for by the independent variables . The R - squared is often used to examine how accurate the predictability of the model is . Table 7 shows the R - squared values for each of the regression models which were derived for the six corresponding ideation metrics . The test of significance of the model predictability suggests that the prediction results of the P - map state count model is more reliable than the strategies counts model . The results also suggest that average novelty and max quality lead to more reliable predictions in both problems . Table 7 . Test of prediction reliability with R - squared Predicted variable State counts Strategies counts D1 D2 D1 D2 Quantity 65 % 75 % 64 % 33 % Variety 56 % 57 % 32 % 8 % Avg . novelty 78 % 65 % 30 % 25 % Max novelty 66 % 72 % 24 % 35 % Avg . quality 72 % 62 % 7 % 9 % Max quality 87 % 71 % 19 % 7 % The choice of the significant regressors for problem D1 ( highlighted in Table 4 ) was a basis for a preliminary feature selection task . We removed the insignificant regressors and used the P - map state counts reduced model of D1 to predict D2 scores as well . We examined the distribution of the residuals ( the difference between the actual ideation scores , and the predicted outcomes ) for the prediction which were made with the D1 models . A good model fit , i . e . , good predictability of the model would be manifested in a normal distribution with mean zero and a low standard deviation , preferably within 10 % of the unit of the metric . Figure 5 through Figure 8 show the distributions of the residuals for four of the ideation metrics which we predicted for D2 in all three regression models based on D1 ( full state counts , strategies , and reduced models ) . The reduced state count regression model is the best predictor of variety , with the closest mean to zero and the lowest standard deviation . Compared to quantity , predictions of variety ( which has the same unit is quantity ) in all three models seem to be more accurate . The majority of differences in the actual and predicted variety scores fall close to zero . Results of predicting average novelty show that the full state counts model has the closest mean to zero ; though , the residuals are more spread out compared to the reduced state count model . Another difference between the full model and the other two models is that they undershoot the results , predicting lower variety on average than the actual outcome . The model based on the occurrences of the strategies has the narrowest spread similarly to the previous metrics . 10 5 0 10 5 0 4 0 - 4 - 8 30 15 0 P - map variables - full model F r e q u e n c y P - map strategies - full model P - map variables - reduced model Mean - 0 . 1433 StDev 1 . 840 N 25 model P - map variables - full Mean - 1 . 321 StDev 2 . 110 N 25 model P - map strategies - full Mean - 0 . 5489 StDev 0 . 6431 N 25 reduced model P - map variables - Histogram of differences between actual and predicted variety concepts per function Figure 5 .

Prediction accuracy of D2 average novelty from models built based on D1 Finally , average and max quality are predicted in an accurate yet imprecise fashion . The distribution of the residuals in Figure 7 and Figure 8suggest that quality scores are the easiest to get a rough estimate of among all the ideation outcome metrics . All three models result in a mean around zero with nearly identical standard deviations . However , unlike the other metrics , none of the regression models lead to a predictor that one can use with offsetting for an error from the mean . 9 Copyright © 2015 by ASME 5 . 0 2 . 5 0 . 0 4 2 0 2 . 4 1 . 2 0 . 0 - 1 . 2 - 2 . 4 - 3 . 6 5 . 0 2 . 5 0 . 0 P - map variables - full model F r e q u e n c y P - map strategies - full model P - map variables - reduced model Mean 0 . 007961 StDev 1 . 425 N 25 model P - map variables - full Mean - 0 . 5967 StDev 1 . 262 N 25 model P - map strategies - full Mean - 0 . 3687 StDev 1 . 241 N 25 reduced model P - map variables - Histogram of differences between actual and predicted average quality score range 1 - 10 Figure 7 .

Prediction accuracy of D2 max quality from models built based on D1 We have found abstraction to positively influence the quantity and the variety of ideas , though for one of the two assigned design problems . Our linear regression models also showed a positive but not statistically significant influence on max novelty and max quality ( p 0 . 52 and coefficient of 0 . 26 for max novelty ; p 0 . 33 and coefficient of 0 . 14 for max quality ) . The literature shows that abstraction generally improves novelty [ 12 ] , and experts utilize abstraction more frequently than novices do [ 13 ] . Finally , we have found that following specific orders in decomposing different aspects of the problem breeds the quantity of ideas . We reported quite contrasting observations in the literature where one study has found decomposition does not affect creativity [ 14 ] while the other shows that the opposite among expert designers [ 9 ] . We should also add that some of the studies that we reviewed in this paper suggest promising alignment between qualitative results with results obtained from quantitative analyses that utilize computational frameworks [ 11 , 18 ] . We believe that using computational methods with data collected on a large scale , coupled with text analysis methods and formal ontologies might help us to reach new findings while avoiding tedious and resource - consuming qualitative research methods . 6 . CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK We have used the Problem Map ( P - map ) computational framework to investigate the relation between problem formulation and ideation in engineering design problems at the early conceptual design stages . Our P - map framework provides the means for extracting different types of information from data fragments that is collected with the web - based Problem Formulator tool . Specifically , two types of variables have been elicited : [ final ] state counts of six types of entities in addition to the counts of entities that are not related to other entities within each group and between the six groups ; counts of traces of strategies which defined with specific series of actions . We have collected data from twenty five students of a product design course , working on two design problems . Problem formulation data is found in P - maps . Ideation data is in the form of concept sketches which has been turned into the ideation effectiveness metrics : quantity , variety , average and max novelty , average and max quality . We have conducted correlations and linear regression studies to examine the relationship between problem formulation and ideation . Common correlation results between the two assigned design problems show that the more issues specified in an unorganized way , the higher the quantity and variety of the ideas . By contrast , when use scenarios are not organized in a hierarchical form , there is a slight drop in average novelty . Additionally , developing use scenarios and functions after related requirements significantly influences quantity . We have built three regression models for each of the ideation metrics : one with all the P - map state count variables , one with the counts of defined strategies , and one with the P - map state count variables that are significant contributors to the initial model ( the reduced model ) . We have built models based on the data from the first problem in order to predict the ideation outcome of the second problem . Our prediction results show that the reduced model is the more accurate in its predictions . However , a test of significance of for model fit suggests that the prediction results of the full P - map state count model is the most reliable among the three regression models . Additionally , we have found average novelty , average quality , and max quality to have more reliable predictor models . We have faced challenges in evaluating text - based data fragments collected with the Formulator tool , as well as finding appropriate design problems and human subjects that represent 10 Copyright © 2015 by ASME enough variability in the distribution of the ideation outcomes . In the future we plan on collecting more data from more subjects working on different problems in a more controlled experimental setting . Our computation framework facilitates an easily scalable study for a large number of data records , since the data structure is predefined . Once an analysis code or a query is written , it can be used to extract information from the database of the web - based tool at nearly no addition computational cost for a large number of records ( different students , problems , and episodes ) . The way towards higher rate of discoveries might lie in employing computational frameworks for data collection on a large scale , guarded with formal ontologies to assist advanced text and natural language processing , while avoiding resource - consuming research methods such as protocol analysis .
