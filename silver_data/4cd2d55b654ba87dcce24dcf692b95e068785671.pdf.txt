Christian Johansson Luleå , November 2009 iv v ABSTRACT In today’s fast - paced industry where fight for market share is fierce and reaching the market ahead of competition imperative , product development is a target for lead - time reductions . In this context , in product development in stage - gate processes , decisions need to be made even though knowledge and information are scarce and flawed . The challenge is how to support the decisions that are made in light of uncertainty and ambiguity . The thesis moves from analysing the role of the stage - gate process within the aerospace industry . The stage - gate process was more than a decision making mechanism , and instead a mechanism that facilitated communication , discussion and knowledge sharing between team members , as well as supported knowledge creation and shaping of the boundaries between people’s different perceptions of the knowledge base . However , the communicative and negotiative function of the stage - gate was highly dependent on the ability of the participating individuals to reflect on the status and quality of the available knowledge assets used throughout the process . To make this reflective activity an explicit part of the stage - gate practice , this thesis proposes the application of a knowledge maturity concept at the gates to raise the decision makers’ awareness of the status of the knowledge assets handled at the decision point . The knowledge maturity concept considers three basic dimensions : input , method / tool and experience / expertise in assessing the knowledge base maturity . The scale is intended to act as a boundary object , facilitating the knowledge creation process by highlighting the current status of the knowledge base and making stakeholders aware of the nature of the project’s uncertainties and ambiguities . In the knowledge maturity concept , its purpose is to support design teams at the gates in taking appropriate action , mitigating risk and focusing their efforts on improving the knowledge assets where it is needed most , regarding the situation at hand and , finally , to make more confident decisions . The thesis was developed within the EU FP6 VIVACE ( Value Improvement through a Virtual Aeronautical Collaborative Enterprise ) and EU FP7 CRESCENDO ( Collaborative and Robust Engineering using Simulation Capability Enabling Next Design Optimisation ) projects , and within the Faste Laboratory , a VINNOVA Excellence Centre involving partners from the Swedish manufacturing industry . Keywords : Knowledge Maturity , Knowledge Management , Stage - Gate , Decision Support , Product Development , Product - Service Systems , Aerospace vi vii SAMMANFATTNING För att vara konkurrenskraftiga behöver företag i dagens industri korta ledtider och nå ut på marknaden med sina produkter före konkurrenterna . Därför är produktutvecklingsfasen ett mål för ledtidsförkortningar , där beslut behöver fattas även där beslutsunderlag kan vara ofullständigt . Utmaningen är stödja detta beslutsfattande som sker trots att beslutsgrunden är osäker . Avhandlingen analyserar stage - gateprocessens roll i flygindustrin , där den befanns ha en vidare roll än enbart vara ett beslutsstöd . Den stödjer kommunikation och kunskapsdelning mellan medlemmar i team , genom att bistå konsultation om medlemmarnas tolkning av kunskapsbasen . Denna kommunikativa aspekt är beroende av medverkande individers förmåga att reflektera statusen och kvaliteten på kunskapen i processen . Den här avhandlingen föreslår ett kunskapsmognadsverktyg ( knowledge maturity ) , för att formalisera den här aktiviteten och stärka beslutsfattares medvetenhet om kunskapens status i beslutspunkter . Verktyget fokuserar på tre dimensioner : indata , metod och expertis / erfarenhet . Mognadsskalan fungerar som ett boundary object , för att underlätta skapande av ny kunskap genom att belysa kunskapsbasens mognad och därigenom göra intressenter medvetna om osäkerheter i projekten . Kunskapsmognad stödjer åtgärder för att hantera risk genom att fokusera den kunskap som är i störst behov av förbättring . Detta ökar beslutsfattarens konfidens i beslut . Arbetet i den här avhandlingen har utförts i projekten VIVACE ( Value Improvement through a Virtual Aeronautical Collaborative Enterprise ) i EUs sjätte ramprogram ( FP6 ) , CRESCENDO ( Collaborative and Robust Engineering using Simulation Capability Enabling Next Design Optimisation ) i EUs sjunde ramprogram ( FP7 ) samt i Fastelaboratoriet , ett VINNOVA Excellence Centre , tillsammans med företag från svensk tillverkningsindustri . viii ix LIST OF ABBREVIATIONS CMM Capability Maturity Model CMMI Capability Maturity Model Integrated DoD Department of Defense DRM Design Research Methodology CRESCENDO Collaborative and Robust Engineering using Simulation Capability Enabling Next Design Optimisation GKMMM General Knowledge Management Maturity Model GMA Gated Maturity Assessment KM Knowledge Management KMMM Knowledge Management Maturity Model KRL Knowledge Readiness Level PAP Project Assurance Plan PDMA Product Development and Management Association PSS Product - Service System R & D 3 Research and Development Degree of Difficulty SECI Socialisation , Externalisation , Combination , Internalisation TORL Total Offer Readiness Level TRL Technology Readiness Level VIVACE Value Improvement through a Virtual Aeronautical Collaborative Enterprise x xi THESIS This thesis comprises of an introductory part and the following appended papers : Paper A Ericson , Å . , Bergström , M . , Johansson , C . , and Larsson , T .

Gate Product Development 1 1 INTRODUCTION The introduction comprises a discussion of the background to my work , followed by a description of the problem I address as well as the aim and purpose of the work . Finally , I present the delimitation of this work , regarding what I am focusing on and the applicability of the work . 1 . 1 Background In a global industry such as aeronautics , the fight for market share is as always very fierce . To gain market share , companies need to constantly improve themselves and thus reach the market quicker and reduce lead - time to get ahead of the competition . Therefore , the product development phase is a constant target for lead - time improvements . However , rendering product development more efficient means rationalising the decision making process and making decisions in a shorter time frame . This puts pressure on making decision making as efficient as possible to do things right from the beginning ( Engwall , 2003a ) . As many as 60 % of the major companies in a 1997 PDMA survey ( Cooper , 2001 ) have implemented a Stage - Gate ( Cooper , 2001 ) influenced process model to manage and govern the product development effort in their companies . Even though the stage - gate is often adapted to suit different companies’ contexts ( Phillips et al . , 1999 ) , the governing qualities of the stage - gate process are attractive for many managers to keep projects on track and ensure that they have control of the projects ( Engwall et al . , 2005 , Christiansen and Varnes , 2006 ) . Engwall ( 2003a , 2003b ) criticises the stage - gate for its lack of learning support and allowance of change in the process , claiming that there is a need to support learning and the knowledge journey that invariably takes place in the process . However , the controlling function and the common language that it provides still makes it a popular choice in many companies ( Engwall et al . , 2005 ) . Engwall ( 2003a , 2003b ) further highlights a major challenge with the stage - gate to balance the controlling function and rigidity of the stage - gate with a pragmatic approach , thus allowing for learning and a flexible approach to the model . This is especially important in innovative projects with a high ambiguity and uncertainty , because it is impossible to know all that needs to be known before the project starts . In essence , there will always be a learning curve in product development projects since something is created that did not exist before . The high level of ambiguity and uncertainty is even more prevalent in the context of product - service systems ( PSS ) ( Mont , 2002 ) and total offers ( Alonso - Christian Johansson 2 Rasgado et al . , 2004 ) . Because PSS is an integration of hardware and services , developed simultaneously in an integrated approach ( Tukker and Tischner , 2004 ) , many diverse knowledge areas ( e . g . engineering design , manufacturing , business development , etc . ) need to be more closely integrated . Further , the total offer concept means that the manufacturer is the owner ( compared to the customer with a traditional product ) for the full duration of the PSS lifecycle ( Tukker and Tischner , 2004 ) , from the first idea to when it is recycled . Customers buy the function that the PSS provides when they need it . This means that all risk related to the maintenance and availability of the ‘product’ lies with the manufacturer ( Alonso - Rasgado et al . , 2004 ) , thus adding an incentive for developers and providers to explore ways of designing the product as efficiently as possible from a lifecycle perspective ( Williams , 2006 ) , to maximise the profit and value that can be drawn from it . As part of a PSS , hardware goes from being a value adding artefact to something that primarily incurs cost and expenditure to the manufacturer ( Williams , 2007 ) . To manage this , the manufacturer and its partners need to bring as much ‘downstream’ knowledge as possible to the early phases of product development . For instance , such downstream knowledge could relate to in - use behaviour , expected maintenance cycles , or recycling considerations . What are the knowledge base’s weaknesses regarding a full lifecycle perspective ? What information do they lack to make confident decisions about lifecycle parameters ? What do they assume , and when are these assumptions correct ? These aspects are filled with inherent uncertainty and ambiguity , since knowing about them is mainly learning about what is currently unknown . Key questions include how much is actually known about the parameters and values related to the decision to be made , and what can they do to advance their understanding before making a decision . According to Carlton et al . ( 2008 ) , ambiguity is “not knowing what to measure , how to structure any measurements , or possibly even where to start looking for variables” ( Carleton et al . , 2008 , p . 1 ) . Uncertainty is “the state in which variables are defined , although the parameters may be incomplete , insufficient or imprecise” ( Carleton et al . , 2008 , p . 1 ) . In product development , especially from an innovation perspective , it can be beneficial to preserve ambiguity and keep an open design space ( Bucciarelli , 1994 ) , and avoid premature closure . However , from a project risk management perspective , when passing the gate into the next stage , ambiguity and uncertainty can also be negative ( Stacey and Eckert , 2003 ) , posing a risk to the decision makers that they will have to deal with and make trade offs where at gaps in the decision base . Today , a single manufacturer produces few products alone . Products are increasingly produced in close collaboration with partners , customers and suppliers , with whom they team up in strategic partnerships , such as virtual ( Browne and Zhang , 1999 , Davidow and Malone , 1993 , Hardwick and Bolton , 1997 ) and extended enterprises ( Boardman and Clegg , 2001 , Browne and Zhang , 1999 , Ericksen and Suri , 2001 ) , to share risk , costs , and revenue , and most importantly allow access to each other’s core competencies and knowledge bases . An example of this approach is the Engine Alliance between General Electric Aircraft Engines and Pratt & Whitney formed a 50 / 50 joint venture to Knowledge Maturity as Decision Support in Stage - Gate Product Development 3 develop a new engine for a new larger version of the Boeing 747 airplane ( Engine Alliance Public Website , 2008 ) . Due to the high capital investments relative to the number of products they would supply , neither of the companies wanted to develop the new engine alone . However , as a team , the business case became sustainable for them to develop the new engine . Even though companies are teaming up more and more in an increasingly competitive market , the challenges with collaborating and the risk with sharing one’s own core knowledge means that few companies would collaborate if they were not forced to . These companies work in a mode of coopetition ( Brandenburger et al . , 1995 ) , a blend of cooperation and competition , i . e . while they are partners and collaborate on one project , they are also competitors in other ventures . Therefore , they have to safeguard their own knowledge and competitive advantage as well as learn from others to maintain or even increase their market share in future ventures . Depending on the situation , the core knowledge that their partners provide can be valuable enough to make it worth the collaborative effort . The main purpose of the stage - gate process is to make decisions and more specifically , facilitate rational decision making ( Christiansen and Varnes , 2006 , Engwall , 2003a ) , where decision makers make the optimal and rational decision based on full knowledge of all alternatives and their outcomes as well as a clear rule and preference ordering by which they should make decisions . In industry practice , rational decision making is something of an unattainable situation in the context of the stage - gate and decision making ( Christiansen and Varnes , 2008 , Simon , 1979 ) . Sufficient available knowledge is very rare to make a truly rational decision . Due to the amount of ambiguity and uncertainty that is common in these kinds of projects , knowing all alternatives and their potential outcomes is a tall task in any situation . Therefore , it is more common that the decision is about choosing a satisfactory alternative given the current understanding of the available knowledge base . Essentially , the decision is about satisficing ( Simon , 1979 ) ( a combination of satisfying and sufficing ) and doing what you can with what you have . Another term related to this is bounded rationality ( Simon , 1979 ) . To make these decisions , the team gathers knowledge and information through activities performed in the different phases of the product development process . These results are packaged in deliverables and other sorts of information carriers and presented at the gate review to influence a decision . There is a need to support decision makers in making confident decisions concerning uncertainty and ambiguity . 1 . 2 Problem Statement In a PSS context , many decisions are increasingly made based on incomplete information and knowledge , with a poor awareness of how this information and knowledge are flawed , uncertain , or ambiguous , i . e . there will always be gaps in the decision base , because information and knowledge have limited degrees of completeness , trustworthiness or accuracy ( Darlington et al . , 2009 ) . However , Christian Johansson 4 decision makers are not always aware of the gaps , how serious they are and what the consequences might be if the gaps are not dealt with adequately . These satisficing decisions still need to be made to keep projects moving , because companies are hesitant to stop projects . Therefore , companies have to deal with decision making situations , where not all information and knowledge are in place . In these situations , decision makers need to raise their awareness of the knowledge and information under review and develop an increased understanding of the flaws in the decision base , to increase their confidence level when making their decisions . Decisions need to be made even though knowledge and information are scarce and flawed . The challenge is how to support the decisions that are made in light of uncertainty and ambiguity . According to Cooper ( 2008 ) , the character of gate criteria by which decision alternatives are contemplated is related to the performance of the product , i . e . a Go / No - Go decision in the gate is mainly based on how the product is anticipated to perform in its intended market . However , Cooper does not focus on uncertainty , ambiguity or knowledge in the gate criteria . Engwall ( 2003b ) stresses that the stage - gate needs to support learning and the knowledge journey that the team conducts , while performing design in projects and thus learning about the product and its usage environment . According to Engwall ( 2003b ) , the strict interpretations of the stage - gate that Cooper advocates make it difficult to support learning , because all knowledge needs to be present . Further , Engwall et al . ( 2005 ) also stress the sense - giving aspect of the stage - gate in controlling the work and facilitating communication in and between teams . Christiansen and Varnes ( 2006 ) find a lack of rational decision making in gate decision , concluding that the stage - gate has more of managerial control function than that of supporting rational decision making and highlights the ignorance of information and the omnipresence of ambiguity . Numerous company strategies and approaches aim to support decision making related to the development of new technologies , e . g . Technology Readiness Level ( TRL ) ( Mankins , 1995 ) among others . Although these approaches might be suitable in a PSS context , the complexity of PSS offers implies that companies not only need to assess the readiness of technological components , but also develop a shared understanding from a wide set of disciplinary concerns and perspectives and assess how each piece of information or knowledge contributes to the knowledge base used to make decisions . Further , providing decision makers with a deeper understanding of the status of the knowledge base is needed to help them deal with the uncertainty and ambiguity of the decision base , and thus provide them with increased confidence . Because essentially knowledge and information prepared in the previous stage are presented as results to the gate meetings , there is a need to support decision making in the gate , by being able to value the knowledge and information in Knowledge Maturity as Decision Support in Stage - Gate Product Development 5 relation to its level of completeness and quality , and not just its performance related aspects . 1 . 3 Aim and Purpose The aim of this work is to provide confidence for decision makers by providing them with a better understanding of the knowledge base that they use to make decisions . The purpose is to investigate and understand the decision making process , and to elaborate on how to support the decision making practice in this process , thus enhancing confidence for decision makers . Therefore , a guiding research question was used : How can decision making in stage - gate processes be supported ? As the work progressed , the analysis highlighted issues of ambiguity and uncertainty . Therefore , focusing on how to support decision making by providing a better understanding of uncertainty and ambiguity has emerged as interesting for this work . 1 . 4 Delimitations Many decisions in product development happen between the gates , perhaps without even being visible from the outside ( e . g . ( Kihlander and Ritzén , 2009 ) ) . For instance , Bragd ( 2002 ) studied over 400 hours of recorded meetings in the Volvo XC90 project – without observing a single ( explicit ) decision being made . “In retrospect , it appeared that they more or less relied on ‘directions’ or ‘main leads’ , ‘recommendations’ , ‘streams’ or ‘tracks’ all of which were concluded in discussions , which organised and structured these different relevant matters . The project team looped the issues within the company . ” ( Bragd , 2002 , p . 86 ) This is also an important aspect for the projects’ progress in addition to the formal and rational decision making that the gates facilitate . While acknowledging this as very important , the main focus of this work is to support the decision making in the gates . A key concern in this thesis is to support the process of highlighting and making decision makers aware of the quality of the material produced for the gates . The main focus of this thesis is on decision making in the stage - gate process and the decisions made at the gates as a social activity by a team of diverse stakeholders ( e . g . from production , design , purchasing , business development , etc . ) . Even though cognitive personal processes have an influence on this activity , the psychology of decision making and cognitive personal processes are not within the scope of this thesis . The aerospace context is vital in this work , with two of the projects purely related to aerospace . Therefore , the main parts of the work were framed within aerospace , and generalising the results to other contexts will therefore require further investigation . Christian Johansson 6 1 . 5 Reader’s Guide This thesis is comprised of an introduction and five appended papers . The introduction is comprised of eight chapters with the contents outlined below .

Chapter 3 highlights the knowledge domains that this thesis uses as a starting point . Here , the focus is on PSS , stage - gate , decision making , knowledge management , boundary objects and maturity constructs . Chapter 4 summarises the appended papers regarding their content , relation to this thesis and work division between the authors . Chapter 5 introduces the aerospace domain , presenting aspects pertaining to this context regarded as important for the reader to be aware of when interpreting the results . The scenario presented in this section introduces how the stage - gate is applied in this context . Chapter 6 presents the main body of results , focusing on the outcomes of both the descriptive and prescriptive research undertaken in this work . The current application and role of the gate in the case companies is presented first , indicating some deviations from the prescribed application in theory .

As well , research contribution in relation to the aim and purpose , and the role of knowledge in gated processes are presented . Chapter 8 concludes the contribution of this work by revisiting the aim and purpose , and then summarising how the results answer these points . Finally , some thoughts on opportunities for future research are presented . Knowledge Maturity as Decision Support in Stage - Gate Product Development 7 2 RESEARCH APPROACH This chapter presents the approach with which I performed the work in the different studies that this thesis is comprised of . It deals with the environment that work has been done in , the DRM framework that has guided the work on a holistic level , and finally , the different approaches to data collection and analysis . 2 . 1 Research Environment Essentially , the work throughout the project has been closely related to the aerospace industry , where two of the projects were purely related to aerospace . 2 . 1 . 1 VIVACE VIVACE stands for Value Improvement through a Virtual Aeronautical Collaborative Enterprise ) ( VIVACE , 2007 ) and was a integrated research project within the European Union’s Sixth Research Framework Programme ( FP6 ) , that ran from 2004 to 2007 . The project was based on the strategies laid forward by the ACARE ( Advisory Council for Aeronautics Research in Europe ) ( ACARE , 2009 ) , which is charged with forecasting air travel and the development of Europe’s aeronautics operations and industry , and to devise plans for research initiatives to reach these targets . Their forecast for the year 2020 , which was a basis for the VIVACE project high level objectives and research goals , was reported in the Strategic Research Agenda ( SRA ) ( SRA , 2002 ) . The main objectives were : • Achieve a 5 % cost and time reduction in aircraft development • Contribute towards a 50 % cost reduction of aero engine development • 30 % lead - time reduction in aero engine development These goals were to be achieved by supporting the design of an aircraft with engines as a virtual product , to be conducted in a virtual enterprise . This process relied upon the support of numerous advanced capabilities developed in the project . In this project , numerous work packages were used to gather research issues in the areas of interest . In the area of future business scenarios for the aero engine development sector ( work package Extended Jet Engine Enterprise Scenario ) , a case called 7 Day Proposal illustrates that the early offer development ( request for proposal ) phase should be shortened from several months to just 7 days . In other words , from the time a request for proposal is received from a potential customer , the virtual enterprise consortium should deliver an offer within 7 Christian Johansson 8 days . This requires radically different ( i . e . more effective and efficient ) practices , methods and tools compared with those deployed in the current business environment . Part of the solution lies in the advanced capabilities of Knowledge Enabled Engineering ( KEE ) , and as a member of this work package in the VIVACE project , the author of this thesis developed the Gated Maturity Assessment tool ( see paper C ) , which supports the assessment of knowledge maturity in a gated rapid proposal development process . This also served as a basis for the Knowledge Maturity tool from paper E . Some of the partners in VIVACE include : • Volvo Aero Corporation , Sweden • BAE Systems , UK • Avio , Italy • Rolls - Royce , UK • Airbus , France / UK / Germany • EADS , France / UK / Germany Participation in both the “problem side” and the “solution side” of the project has given unique insights into the challenging situations and issues that aerospace companies experience , and how they attempt to deal with these issues in the search for product and process improvements . 2 . 1 . 2 Faste Laboratory The Faste Laboratory ( The Faste Laboratory , 2009 ) , a VINNOVA VINN Excellence Centre with a 10 - year mandate from 2007 - 2016 , was named in honour of the late Stanford professor Rolf Faste , an authority and pioneer in creativity and innovation . The main goal of the Faste Laboratory is to achieve functional product innovation ( FPI ) , with special focus on the functional product development process . In the Faste Laboratory network , eight companies from various Swedish industries participate and contribute to the research results , Partners in the Faste Laboratory are : • Volvo Aero Corporation • Sandvik Coromant • Volvo Construction Equipment • Volvo Car Corporation • BAE Land Systems Hägglunds • Hägglunds Drives • Gestamp HardTech • LKAB 2 . 1 . 3 CRESCENDO CRESCENDO stands for Collaborative and Robust Engineering using Simulation Capability Enabling Next Design Optimisation , and is a successor of the VIVACE project , described above . It is a large - scale integrating project , operating in the European Union’s seventh research framework programme ( FP7 ) with partners from Europe’s aeronautics industry and is scheduled to run Knowledge Maturity as Decision Support in Stage - Gate Product Development 9 for 3 years from 2009 - 2012 . This project utilises the results from VIVACE and aims to raise the bar even higher , to contribute to a strong European aerospace industry . The project aims to support the development of a Behavioural Digital Aircraft ( BDA ) among enterprise partners , by taking the concept of the virtual product and virtual enterprise from the VIVACE goals a step further and stressing the importance of supporting the development throughout the entire product life cycle , even during the testing and certification phases that normally require the manufacturing of many expensive physical prototypes . Here , the idea is to minimise the number of physical models and perform more work in the virtual domain . One of the focus areas is enterprise collaboration , which supports collaboration , knowledge sharing and decision making for the development of a behavioural digital aircraft in the virtual enterprise . Some of the partners in CRESCENDO include : • Volvo Aero Corporation , Sweden • Rolls - Royce , UK • Alenia Aeronautica , Italy • EADS , France / UK / Germany • Airbus , France / UK / Germany • SAAB , Sweden 2 . 2 Research Framework In this work , I have been influenced by the Design Research Methodology ( DRM ) ( Blessing and Chakrabarti , 2002 ) , working as a holistic framework when setting up studies and relating them to the main research process . In the summer of 2007 , I had the opportunity to take part in the Summer School on Engineering Design Research , offered by professors Lucienne Blessing and Mogens Myrup Andreasen . This course is essentially structured around DRM , and was therefore my first introduction to the DRM framework . This approach has proven useful when planning the research project and setting up studies , because the phases ( research clarification , descriptive study I , prescriptive study , and descriptive study II ) are intuitive and help to position the studies in an implicit mental framework . Figure 1 . Design Research Methodology , after Blessing and Chakrabarti ( Blessing and Chakrabarti , 2009 ) . Christian Johansson 10 In this work , the main focus of the DRM model has been on the first three phases ( see Figure 2 ) , i . e . exploring the industry practice and a wider problem area to find an overall focus and further investigating this area to uncover challenges , problems and current ways of working . Finally , a suggestion for a support that would approach the problem area and support stakeholders in stage - gate product development practice was designed and elaborated upon . Figure 2 highlights these aspects , positioning the studies—with information about the mode of data collection , participants and focus—in the different papers regarding which phase of the DRM was the main focus and which were complementary . Figure 2 . Use of DRM model in the work . 2 . 3 Case Study Research The main influence for designing individual studies in this work has been case studies ( Yin , 2003 ) , which provided a useful baseline because the area of concern has been in a contemporary live process in industry that cannot be lifted out of its context and where the events cannot be controlled ( Yin , 2003 ) . Yin ( 2003 ) states that a case study is “…an empirical study that investigates a contemporary phenomenon within its real - life context” ( Yin , 2003 , p . 13 ) . A case study approach is applicable , especially when the boundaries between the phenomenon being studied and its context are unclear . This matches the reality in the case companies with their stage - gate instantiations . For instance , it is difficult to remove the stage - gate from its context and conduct experiments Knowledge Maturity as Decision Support in Stage - Gate Product Development 11 without making it difficult to analyse the data adequately , because the complexity of different environmental factors are virtually impossible to mimic . Further , because the project is about understanding “how” the practical decision making in gates can be supported , the case study approach is also appropriate ( Yin , 2003 ) . During the work , studies resembling both single - case and multiple - case studies were undertaken . 2 . 4 Data Collection Data in this research work was mainly collected through interviews and workshops . Some process descriptions were referred to in the interviews , and the interviews were followed up with additional structured interview forms , albeit with a limited response rate , to fill gaps from the interviews and possibly strengthen the aspect of using additional sources of evidence to some extent . Figure 2 , above , depicts which approaches were used in which studies . 2 . 4 . 1 Semi - structured interviews The main form of data collection were interviews , specifically semi - structured interviews with an open - ended character ( Yin , 2003 ) . According to Yin ( 2003 ) , this is one of the most important sources of data in a case study . The qualitative nature of interviews provides a breadth for the data collection ( Fontana and Frey , 1994 ) . Open - ended interviews allow the researcher to follow a strict line of inquiry , as prepared and planned , and to diverge into other areas as they become apparent during the interview ( Yin , 2003 ) . The informants are also great sources in directing the researcher towards other sources of evidence as well as other respondents in their networks that can be of interest for the researcher to address and interview ( Yin , 2003 ) . The interviews were recorded to aid in capturing the information correctly after the interview . Here , it is important that recording does not inhibit the respondents or makes them feel uncomfortable ( Yin , 2003 ) . Therefore , an approach where the material is made anonymous was adopted and where the material was iterated with the respondents to make sure that information was captured accurately and to their satisfaction . Finally , recording the interviews can never act as a substitute for listening and participating actively in the interview ( Yin , 2003 ) , which normally include taking field notes . It is important that the researcher does not become complacent and stays alert to moderate the direction of the open - ended interview . 2 . 4 . 2 Workshops Workshops were another form of data collection , performed as group interviews . The group interview is a useful tool , since it has the benefit of being ( relatively ) inexpensive , data rich , flexible , and stimulating for the respondents ( Fontana and Frey , 1994 ) . If facilitation and moderation are important aspects in semi - structured and open - ended interviews , then it is an imperative quality of a researcher in the Christian Johansson 12 workshop mode , since the group can assume a life of its own and diverge the discussion into all sorts of areas that it might find interesting . This makes the workshop an attractive method because it can yield large quantities of information from a broad area in a relatively small amount of time , if used wisely . Still , the risk is that the information will be too diverse and off topic , given the difficulty of keeping the group focused on the topic of interest and thus moderating the session properly ( Fontana and Frey , 1994 ) . Another challenge for the moderator is to allow all respondents to contribute in a somewhat equal and satisfactory fashion , balancing the shy and less talkative with the more dominating participants ( Fontana and Frey , 1994 ) . “First , the interviewer must keep one person or a small coalition of persons from dominating the group ; second , he or she must encourage recalcitrant respondents to participate ; and third , he or she must obtain responses from the entire group to ensure the fullest possible coverage of the topic . ” ( Fontana and Frey , 1994 , p . 365 ) The workshops reported in paper B also had the character of a focus group ( Fontana and Frey , 1994 ) at times , where the respondents reacted to proposed developments suggested by the researcher . 2 . 4 . 3 Future workshop In paper A , the main data collection method was workshops and in particular an approach called future workshop ( Kensing and Madsen , 1991 ) . A future workshop consists of three phases : a critique phase , a fantasy phase , and an implementation phase . The critique phase highlights specific problems of the current practice , focusing on the as - is situation with its issues from a critical perspective . The fantasy phase is focused on the future , where the mindset is ‘in the best of worlds’ and there are no obstacles and nothing is impossible . This phase deals with focusing on the to - be situation , as forecasted by the participants . The implementation phase deals with how the fantasy should be reached . What activities and developments are needed to reach this fantasy ? How does the environment have to change to get there ? 2 . 5 Analysis Data collected from the interviews and workshops were transcribed into plain text . The transcripts were then read through and reflected upon both from a detailed perspective and on a holistic level . To maintain a chain of evidence ( Yin , 2003 ) , the transcripts were also iterated with the respondents , allowing them to read the transcripts , comment and suggest changes , where the corrections needed to truthfully reflect their views on the situation being studied . The analytical lens has been focused on the concept of maturity as a way of creating an awareness of the current status of the knowledge assets available to decision makers . Interesting excerpts from the interviews were highlighted in the transcripts and copied into a mind map format . This simplified a comparison of the answers from multiple respondents , where themes could be identified and strengthened .

Christian Johansson 14 3 KNOWLEDGE DOMAINS This chapter presents the theoretical concepts that this work is based on and begins by giving the reader an awareness of the base of my work . These areas are product - service systems , product development , where the stage - gate receives special attention , decision making , knowledge management , boundary objects , and maturity . 3 . 1 Product - Service Systems Product - Service Systems ( PSS ) ( Mont , 2002 ) is a term depicting an integration of products and services in one offering , called total offers ( Alonso - Rasgado et al . , 2004 ) . Figure 3 shows a spectrum of PSS , with different types of PSS depending on orientation and the amount of product and service proportion . Product oriented PSS depicts a product with a service add - on , whereas a result oriented PSS does not specify which product content is needed to reach a certain result ( Williams , 2007 ) , i . e . perform a specific service . Figure 3 . Product - service system , adopted from Tukker and Tischner ( 2004 ) . PSS takes a more holistic perspective to the concept of the product , integrating diverse knowledge areas and taking on a lifecycle responsibility ( Tukker and Tischner , 2004 , Williams , 2006 ) . In a traditional approach ( also known as time and materials in the aerospace context ) where the product is first developed , then sold to the customer , who finally have to by maintenance and spare parts uphold the product on the aftermarket . In a PSS scenario , the manufacturer is the owner of the product from the beginning to the end of the product’s lifecycle , i . e . when it will be recycled . This means that the manufacturer takes on the risk , while the customer will only pay for the utilisation of the function that is provided . Knowledge Maturity as Decision Support in Stage - Gate Product Development 15 The extended responsibility on the manufacturer side as well as the integration of many domains ( i . e . product development , service development , recycling , etc . ) , means that the manufacturers need to move ‘downstream’ knowledge into the early phases of the PSS development ( Rovida et al . , 2009 ) and have a good understanding of the diverse knowledge base regarding which ambiguities and uncertainties that there are in the PSS offering . 3 . 2 Product Development Ulrich and Eppinger ( 2008 ) describe product development as “… the set of activities beginning with the perception of a market opportunity and ending in the production , sale and delivery of a product” ( Ulrich and Eppinger , 2008 , p . 2 ) . From the description above , the general normative description of product development is similar in that the process starts with an idea and ends with a product that is sold . It is generally perceived as a sequential process , albeit with some feedback loops in the process , and some put phases in parallel ( cf . integrated product development ( Andreasen and Hein , 1987 ) ) . For instance , the concept design phase precedes the detail design phase ; it is an intuitive way of organising the activities . A very popular model in especially larger companies with many people and much resources invested in product development is the stage - gate model ( Cooper , 2001 ) . It is popular because of its fit for management and control of the processes ( Engwall , 2003a ) , with the gates as milestones where management can intervene and control the project . In aerospace , having a stage - gate process is a mandatory standard ( Society of Automotive Engineers and European Association of Aerospace Industries , 1999 ) . 3 . 2 . 1 Stage - gate The stage - gate process , developed by Cooper ( Cooper , 2001 , Cooper , 2008 ) , is a process that facilitates taking projects from the idea state to the launch of a product . It is based on a phased review process ( Cooper , 2001 , Cooper , 2008 ) implemented by NASA , called Phased Project Planning ( Engwall , 2003b ) . This was first used in the major development programs that NASA undertook during 1960s , where the need to manage projects effectively became apparent . With the phased process , it was possible to break the long process up into distinct stages , where reporting and decision making were possible between two stages . An important benefit with the phased process was that it allowed NASA to cancel or re - prioritise projects , including being able to change contractors in the middle of a running project ( Engwall , 2003b ) . Based on an investigation of numerous successful and unsuccessful projects in various industries ( Cooper , 2001 ) , distinguishing the factors of why successful companies succeed and why others fail , concluding that ‘winners’ , among many things , have an articulated product innovation strategy and tough go / kill decision points to focus their efforts on the core value creating activities . Cooper ( 2001 ) thus revisited the phased project management idea when devising his Stage - Gate process ( Cooper , 2001 ) . Christian Johansson 16 The original stage - gate process is broken down into five main stages with predefined activities and five gates where evaluation and decision making take place , as seen in Figure 4 . In practical applications of the model , the structure can be changed , either adding or removing gates , as well as changing the content and task of the stages and gates ( Phillips et al . , 1999 ) . Figure 4 . Stage - gate process overview ( adapted from ( Cooper , 2008 ) ) . The main structural idea ( see Figure 5 ) with the stage - gate process is a stage , where activities are performed and where information and knowledge are collected and aggregated . A gate , where the information and knowledge are assessed and decisions are made follows the stage . Figure 5 . Stage - gate structure with a stage followed by a gate ( adapted from ( Cooper , 2008 ) ) . Each stage ( see Figure 5 ) is comprised of activities performed simultaneously , to take the project and mature the product , from one gate to the next in the project planning . These activities can be seen as an information and knowledge creation and gathering activity that produces input to the gate ( Cooper , 2008 ) . The information is analysed and packaged in deliverables and information carriers that the project leader brings to the gate . The gate ( see Figure 5 ) is a decision point , where the progress of the project until the gate moment and its future direction are reviewed . The progress is initially evaluated and compared with a set of criteria ( e . g . alignment with business strategy , competitive advantage of product , market potential , leverage Knowledge Maturity as Decision Support in Stage - Gate Product Development 17 of core competencies , technical feasibility , and financial reward versus risk ) ( Cooper , 2008 ) that need to be fulfilled to open the gate . Based on this , a decision is made . According to Cooper ( 2001 ) there are four options to choose from . The first is ‘Go’ , when the project status is in line with the targets and requirements for the project and no changes to the previous results are needed . The options of ‘Recycle’ and ‘Hold’ are next , depicting that the project cannot be released from the gate to the next stage and that changes are needed for the gate to open . Finally , the ‘Kill’ option means that the project should not continue , because the prospect of having a successful product has vanished , either because the project results are of substandard quality or the environmental climate has changed . Once a decision is made , the final action at the gate is to decide on advancing forward , including expectations for the next gate ( i . e . criteria are reviewed ) and the resources that the project team have a their disposal during the coming stage . The stage - gate process is quite rigid , allowing for little flexibility in the development process , though one of its main benefits is that it is an ample tool for managing and governing projects ( Engwall , 2003b ) , needed from a management perspective . In industry , the main benefit with this process is not the detailed description of the activities that should be performed in each phase ( Cooper , 2008 ) , but rather its basic ( visual ) structure with stages and gates as decision points ( Cooper , 2008 ) , making it an intuitive model for project management . Further , because stage - gate is almost an industry standard , it is easy for new project members to adapt to , giving confidence to those working in the projects ( Engwall , 2003a ) . The rigidity of the process has an important consequence from a learning and knowledge perspective . Engwall ( 2003b ) highlights this perspective and points to the importance of approaching the model with a mindset that allows for learning as well as adjustment of the project goals as new knowledge becomes available . Essentially , he advocates a pragmatic frame of mind when working with the stage - gate process ( Engwall et al . , 2005 ) . 3 . 3 Decision Making Mintzberg et al . ( 1976 ) define a decision as a specific commitment to action . Further , they define the decision process as the “set of actions and dynamic factors that begins with the identification of a stimulus for action and ends with the specific commitment to actions” ( Mintzberg et al . , 1976 , p . 246 ) . Based on a three - step model to decision making by Simon ( 1954 in ( Mintzberg et al . , 1976 ) ) , Mintzberg et al . ( 1976 ) developed a model consisting of the stages identification , development , and selection . The identification phase consists of decision recognition and diagnosis . Recognition is about recognising opportunities , problems and crises , and to evoke decision activity . A need for a decision is discovered , because there is a difference between information of a situation compared to what is expected . Diagnosis is about clarifying and defining the issues . Christian Johansson 18 As Mintzberg et al . ( 1976 ) state , the decision development phase is the heart of the decision making process , where solutions to decision making problems are introduced . Development can take place as one or both of the search and design routines . Search deals with searching for existing solutions , whereas design deals with custom made solutions that are created . Finally , the selection phase has three sub - steps : screen , evaluation - choice , and authorisation . Screen is used to narrow down the amount of alternatives to a few feasible ones , by eliminating those that are unfeasible . Evaluation - choice evaluates the remaining alternatives and selects a course of action . Authorisation deals with ratifying the selected alternative with higher levels of the organisation and thus builds support for it so that it can be carried through . Drucker ( 2001 ) highlights six step involved in effective decision making : 1 ) Classifying the problem : Whether generic , exceptional or unique . Is it the first instantiation of a generic problem , or just a one - time occurrence ? 2 ) Defining the problem : Ensuring that you define the problem correctly and thus solve the right problem . Continually revisit the problem , and check it again and again . 3 ) Specifying the answer to the problem : Finding and specifying the boundary conditions . Sometimes the boundary conditions change , turning a right decision into a wrong decision . 4 ) Deciding what is “right” , rather than what is acceptable : Important to start with what is the right decision to make , you will still always need to make compromises . 5 ) Building into the decision the action to carry it out : No decision has been made unless it is put into action . The people charged with carrying out the action need incentive to do it and the mandate to do it . 6 ) Testing validity and effectiveness by following up on actual course of events : Even the best decision has a probability of going wrong . Feedback reports ( written ) are not enough ; decision makers have to go into the field to look at it . 3 . 3 . 1 Rational decision making Rational decision - making is based on four aspects ( March , 1999 ) : knowledge of alternatives , knowledge of consequences of alternative actions , consistent preference ordering , and a decision rule by which to select a single alternative of action . Similarly , according to Simon ( 1979 ) rational decision - making : “…calls for knowledge of all the alternatives that are open to choice . It calls for complete knowledge of , or ability to compute , the consequences that will follow on each of the alternatives . It calls for certainty in the decision maker ' s present and future evaluation of these consequences . It calls for the ability to compare consequences , no matter how diverse and heterogeneous , in terms of some consistent measure of utility . ” ( Simon , 1979 , p . 500 ) Rational decision making is related to rational choice theory , which is based on the notion that all action is rational and that people calculate costs and benefits of everything they do beforehand . Scott ( 2000 ) states that rational choice theory Knowledge Maturity as Decision Support in Stage - Gate Product Development 19 “denies the existence of any kinds of action other than the purely rational and calculative . All social action , it is argued , can be seen as rationally motivated , as instrumental action , however much it may appear to be irrational or non - rational . ” ( Scott , 2000 , pp . 126 - 127 ) . 3 . 3 . 2 Bounded rationality and satisficing However , rational decision making is rare in practical situations ( Simon , 1979 ) . The rational choice approach places rather severe demands on the decision - maker ( Simon , 1955 ) , since he or she has limited computational capacity and limited access to information , making rational decision making hard . Sometimes all alternatives are not sought out and their consequences are not known ( Simon , 1979 ) . “Of course the solution , though it provides optimal decisions for the simplified world of our assumptions , provides , at best , satisfactory solutions for the real - world decision problem [ … ] . In - principle , unattainable optimization is sacrificed for in - practice , attainable satisfaction . ” ( Simon , 1979 , p . 499 ) . Rationality becomes bounded when all alternatives are not known , when external factors cannot be managed , or when consequences cannot be calculated ( Simon , 1979 ) . Central to bounded rationality is ‘search’ and ‘satisficing’ . Satisficing is a portmanteau of ‘satisfying’ and ‘sufficing’ . Essentially , it describes the selection of something that is good enough ( Simon , 1955 ) or close enough with regards to most needs of the decision situation . “Model construction under these stringent conditions has taken two directions . The first is to retain optimization , but to simplify sufficiently so that the optimum is computable . The second is to construct satisficing models that provide good enough decisions with reasonable costs of computation . ” ( Simon , 1979 , p . 498 ) In this context , gut feeling is important for decisions , because when complete information is lacking , decision makers have to take the decisions that they feel is best , trusting emotions and intuitions ( Hayashi , 2001 ) . Simon ( 1955 ) mentions the concept of an aspiration level , where many possible alternatives sets the bar high for the decision and few or no alternatives force the decision maker to lower the aspiration level to bring satisfactory solutions into existence . When an alternative is found , or when the aspiration level matches a good enough alternative , the search is terminated and a decision is made ( Simon , 1979 ) . 3 . 4 Knowledge Management Knowledge Management ( KM ) can be defined as “…the systematic processes by which knowledge needed for an organization to succeed is created , captured , shared and leveraged . ” ( Rumizen , 2002 , p . 9 ) . KM focuses mainly on organisational aspects and how knowledge can be managed for the benefit of the organisation . A major focus is to make sure that knowledge does not leave with the employee who leaves or quits ( Kreiner , Christian Johansson 20 2002 , Jasimuddin et al . , 2005 ) , thus focusing on storing the knowledge in the organisational memory ( Holsapple , 2003 ) . Another interesting aspect in this context is expertise sharing , where expertise symbolise a relative level of knowledge among people . Experts are people who are relatively knowledgeable in a specific area among their peers . Ackerman et al . ( 2003 ) states that : “Relatively few people will claim to be experts , but many people agree that they have some measure of expertise in some area” ( Ackerman et al . , 2003 , p . xv ) . One way to distinguish knowledge is to differentiate it based on whether it is formalised or if it resides in the mind of the owner , i . e . whether it is explicit or tacit . Tacit knowledge Michael Polanyi ( Polanyi , 1962 , Polanyi , 1966 , Polanyi , 1967 ) first mentioned tacit knowledge as knowledge that is hard to encode and communicate . Polanyi also uses the term ‘personal knowledge’ , which stresses that tacit knowledge is highly personal and deeply rooted in the person holding it . Tacit knowledge is rooted in action , procedures , routines , commitment , ideals , values , emotions and involvement in a specific context ( Nonaka , 1994 , Nonaka et al . , 2000 ) and includes subjective insights , intuition and hunches . This makes it hard to formalise and communicate ( Nonaka , 1994 , Nonaka and Takeuchi , 1995 ) . Tacit knowledge is created from people’s own experiences and is difficult to understand and imitate ( Jasimuddin et al . , 2005 ) . Tacit knowledge is ambiguous in nature , making duplication difficult . However , there is also a risk of losing the knowledge due to the loss of employees ( Kreiner , 2002 , Jasimuddin et al . , 2005 ) . The transfer of tacit knowledge is best achieved by using shared experiences , such as spending time together in the same environment ( Nonaka et al . , 2000 ) , on , for example , in apprenticeships , since it relates to personal skills ( Nonaka et al . , 2000 , Wyatt , 2001 ) . In these apprenticeships , apprentices learn the tacit knowledge needed for their craft through hands on experience ( Nonaka and Takeuchi , 1995 , Snowden , 2003 ) , under the guidance of experts . Tacit knowledge forms the basis of explicit knowledge ( Jasimuddin et al . , 2005 ) , but is often understood to comprise the main body of knowledge . Polanyi proposes that we “know more than we can tell” ( Polanyi , 1967 , p . 4 ) . Explicit knowledge Explicit knowledge , or codified knowledge , is knowledge that is transmittable in formal , systematic language ( Hey , 2004 , Nonaka , 1994 , Polanyi , 1966 ) . This knowledge includes facts , rules , relationships , and policies that can be codified and shared without need for discussion ( Wyatt , 2001 ) . Becasue explicit knowledge is codified , it is easy to communicate and store ( Jasimuddin et al . , 2005 ) . The risk of losing explicit knowledge due to employee turnover is quite small ( Jasimuddin et al . , 2005 ) . Hey ( 2004 ) relates to tacit and explicit knowledge with the metaphor of viscosity , illustrating that explicit knowledge is “sticky” , whereas tacit knowledge is “leaky” and hard to retain . Relation between tacit and explicit , and the conversion between them Tacit and explicit knowledge are closely related , with a main target of knowledge management to formalise and codify tacit knowledge so that it Knowledge Maturity as Decision Support in Stage - Gate Product Development 21 becomes explicit and can be stored in knowledge repositories or other types of databases . A driver for this process is the knowledge’s accessibility ( Jasimuddin et al . , 2005 ) , and that explicit knowledge is accessible by everyone as opposed to just the owners , and thus stays in the company despite employee turnover . Further , Jasimuddin et al . ( 2005 ) propose that the tacit and explicit parts are inseparable and complimentary to each other , with all knowledge having both tacit and explicit parts . Their relationship is similar to an iceberg , where the visible , explicit part is supported and given meaning by the hidden , tacit part ( Jasimuddin et al . , 2005 ) . Nonaka et al . ( 2000 ) state that “…to understand the true nature of knowledge and knowledge creation , we need to recognise that tacit and explicit knowledge are complimentary” ( Nonaka et al . , 2000 , p . 8 ) , where new knowledge is created through interactions between tacit and explicit knowledge . Nonaka et al . ( 2000 ) suggest a knowledge creation process consisting of three elements : the SECI ( socialisation , externalisation , combination , and internalisation ) process , the concept of ‘ba’ ( shared context ) , and knowledge assets ( inputs , outputs and moderator of the knowledge creation process ) ( Nonaka et al . , 2000 ) . The SECI process is the process of converting and recreating explicit and tacit knowledge . The SECI process is depicted in the form of a spiral , since the interaction between explicit and tacit knowledge amplifies knowledge creation , creating new and improved knowledge as it is transformed . Socialisation is about creating new tacit knowledge from existing tacit knowledge through shared experiences . Externalisation is about articulating tacit knowledge into explicit . Combination depicts converting explicit knowledge into more complex and systematic sets of knowledge . Internalisation is “learning by doing” by embodying the explicit into tacit . Figure 6 . The SECI process , depicting modes of knowledge creation and conversion , from ( Nonaka et al . , 2000 ) . ‘Ba’ ( Nonaka et al . , 2000 ) roughly translates into ‘place’ , and depicts the context where knowledge is created , be it physical , virtual or mental . A key concept Christian Johansson 22 with ‘ ba’ is the interaction between people , as well as their interaction with their environment . Knowledge assets are knowledge that work as “…firm - specific resources that create value for the firms , by being inputs , outputs and moderators of the knowledge - creating process” ( Nonaka et al . , 2000 , p . 20 ) . 3 . 5 Boundary Objects The concept of Ba , being a place for knowledge creation that facilitates interaction among people , has an interesting relation to artefacts that fill a similar function in product development , facilitating communication between designers . People working on solving problems in product development come from different social worlds ( Star and Griesemer , 1989 ) and because these worlds need to cooperate , there is a need to facilitate this cooperation – sharing knowledge , information of the other person’s tasks , and information of the design process ( Boujut and Blanco , 2003 ) – even though they are not automatically equipped with the vocabulary and language to do this . Boundary objects are defined by Star and Griesemer ( 1989 ) as : “…objects which are both plastic enough to adapt to local needs and the constraints of the several parties employing them , yet robust enough to maintain a common identity across sites . [ … ] These objects may be abstract or concrete . They have different meanings in different social worlds but their structure is common enough to more than one world to make them recognizable , a means of translation . The creation and management of boundary objects is a key process in developing and maintaining coherence across intersecting social worlds . ” ( Star and Griesemer , 1989 , p . 393 ) A boundary object ( Star and Griesemer , 1989 ) is a concept to depict an artefact ( tangible or intangible ) that is used as a means to cooperate across boundaries , different disciplines or social worlds , and which does not share a common vocabulary for solving problems . The boundary object is used to transmit information and knowledge about the product across these boundaries and to achieve a shared understanding for the product . Teams can gather and discuss problems , possible solutions , etc . , where the boundary object serves as an interface among the team members . However , a boundary object is not about achieving consensus among the actors ( Star and Griesemer , 1989 ) , and the boundary object as such may mean different things to different people ( Larsson , 2003 ) . The main purpose of the boundary object is to facilitate cooperation and communication between project members ( Henderson , 1991 , Stacey and Eckert , 2003 , Star and Griesemer , 1989 ) . Carlile ( 2002 ) highlights three characteristics that make boundary objects useful for solving problems at boundaries : ( 1 ) “a boundary object establishes a shared syntax or language for individuals to represent their knowledge” ( Carlile , 2002 , p . 451 ) , ( 2 ) a boundary object “provides a concrete means for individuals to specify and learn about their differences and dependencies across a given boundary” ( Carlile , 2002 , p . 452 ) , and Knowledge Maturity as Decision Support in Stage - Gate Product Development 23 ( 3 ) a boundary object “facilitates a process where individuals can jointly transform their knowledge” ( Carlile , 2002 , p . 452 ) into new knowledge . Examples of boundary object can be sketches , process models , CAD files , prototypes , etc . Star and Griesemer ( 1989 ) found that the State of California was a boundary object for the people involved in the museum project from their particular case . Conversely , any artefact or prototype used and developed by several team members from different functions or areas does not necessarily have to be a boundary object ( Clark , 2004 , Lee , 2007 ) . If it does not fulfil the purpose of bridging different disciplines and facilitating a shared understanding between people , it is merely an object or an artefact , which may still be vital to the end product . The concept of boundary objects can be regarded as a subset of coordinative artefacts ( Schmidt and Wagner , 2002 ) . Another type of coordinative artefacts and a related concept is intermediary objects ( Boujut and Blanco , 2003 ) , which depict objects that represent intermediate states of a future product . The intermediary objects act as representations of either the product itself or the design process , i . e . Gantt charts , process descriptions , etc . ( Boujut and Blanco , 2003 ) . Essentially , as more information and knowledge are created the intermediary object evolves . Boundary negotiating artefacts ( Lee , 2007 ) , is a term to illustrate artefacts related to boundary objects , but differ because they not only cross boundaries , they are also used to push existing boundaries and establish new ones . In doing so , they reach new levels of knowledge by synthesising and innovating across the different practices and thus enable knowledge sharing and knowledge creation . “Boundary negotiating artifacts are used to : record , organize , explore and share ideas ; introduce concepts and techniques ; create alliances ; create a venue for the exchange of information ; augment brokering activities ; and create shared understanding about speci ﬁ c design problems . ” ( Lee , 2007 , p . 333 ) . Lee ( 2007 ) states that they can sometimes be predecessors of boundary objects . However , boundary negotiating artefacts may often be more than sufficient for collaboration . Boundary objects are often found in projects comprised of routine tasks , whereas boundary negotiating artefacts are more common in projects with non - routine work and fairly complex tasks ( Lee , 2007 ) . 3 . 6 Maturity The word ‘maturity’ is defined as “the state of being fully grown or developed” ( Oxford University Press , 2000a , p . 791 ) , i . e . maturity deals with describing an end state when something is fully developed or ready . In the context of this thesis , maturity and level of maturity deals with assessing a percentage or a proportion of completeness of an artefact , service or both . For instance , Grebici et al . ( 2007 ) define maturity as “a compromise between the target uncertainty and the expected uncertainty . ” ( Grebici et al . , 2007 , p . 282 ) , i . e . maturity reflects the “distance” between the actual level of completeness relative to what should be the level of completeness . Related to maturity , e . g . in the Technology Readiness Level ( TRL ) ( Mankins , 1995 ) , the word ‘readiness’ is described as Christian Johansson 24 “the state of being ready or prepared for sth” ( Oxford University Press , 2000b , p . 1053 ) , and in this context is also related to the relative difference between actual status and the targeted status . 3 . 6 . 1 Maturity in relation to knowledge Bohn ( 1994 ) defines maturity of knowledge as “understanding the effects of the input variables on the output” ( Bohn , 1994 , p . 63 ) . In this process , not everything can be known . Some effect can be clearly stated and therefore controlled , whereas others are exogenous and uncontrollable . Bohn ( 1994 ) further states that : “The manager ' s or process engineer ' s goal is to manipulate the raw materials , controls and environment to get output that is as good as possible . It is customary to treat the environmental variables as exogenous and uncontrollable . However , with enough knowledge , the environmental variables can be turned into control variables and , therefore , are not exogenous” ( p . 63 ) Assessing the maturity of knowledge can be intended as a way to increase the understanding of where knowledge is positioned in this continuum between the controllable and that of the exogenous and uncontrollable to start the process of moving it towards a more controllable state . Grebici et al . ( 2007 ) propose an information maturity framework to aid exchange of immature information between designers by specifying uncertainty in information , thus highlighting their confidence in the information . “The information maturity could be the means by which the actors can exchange the information while expressing their level of commitment and their responsibility regarding the risks caused by the information uncertainty” ( Grebici et al . , 2007 , p . 283 ) Knowledge Management Maturity Model ( KMMM ) is a term that has been used in various places . Pee et al . ( 2006 ) provide a review of different efforts , while proposing their own ‘General KMMM’ that attempts to unite them into one easier to use model . The main purpose of the general KMMM is to assess the capability or maturity of a company’s Knowledge Management initiatives . In a technical report on microgravity fluids , Chiaramonte and Joshi ( 2004 ) of NASA briefly mention the concept of Knowledge Readiness Level ( KRL . Sometimes the engineer needs to know if the answer to an issue is just a phone call away or if there is a need for a fundamental research program , to mention the two extremes . This could serve as a guide in selecting certain solutions as : “…the cost of the " answer " is related to the KRL . Low KRL ' s are relatively inexpensive , while high KRL ' s require substantial research funding“ ( Chiaramonte and Joshi , 2004 , p . 36 ) Knowledge Maturity as Decision Support in Stage - Gate Product Development 25 3 . 6 . 2 Technology Readiness Level NASA ( Mankins , 1995 ) developed the concept Technology Readiness Level ( TRL ) to work as a framework and guide the development of technologies and systems to be used on space missions . Because the cost of any failure can be extremely high , ensuring that any component or system fitted onto a product going into space is properly and sufficiently tested and validated in environments relevant to the final mission is needed . The United States Department of Defense ( DoD ) uses TRL to assess technology maturity when acquiring new technologies for the U . S . military , as part of the DoD “Defense Acquisition Guidebook” ( DoD Defense Aquisition Guidebook , 2009 ) to support the assessment of technologies before making acquisition decisions . The TRL features a 9 - level criterion scale , using the analogy of a thermometer ( see Figure 7 ) , which represents technologies in development from a research / laboratory state to a “flight proven” implementation in a product . There are many approaches to tweak or extend the TRL concept , one example is the product readiness level that expand the scope to cover a whole product , i . e . with ideas for integration of multiple technologies and rating and weighting functionalities ( Hicks et al . , 2009 ) . In Graettinger et al . ( 2002 ) , the TRL concept has a great value as something that can be associated to a boundary object or at least an artefact that facilitates discussions between stakeholders . “…the greatest value from using TRLs comes from the discussions between the stakeholders that go into negotiating a TRL value” ( Graettinger et al . , 2002 , p . 8 ) , since the TRL scale provides a common language for different stakeholders affected by a technology . Figure 7 . Technology Readiness Level , from ( Nasa . gov ) . 3 . 6 . 3 Capability Maturity Model Dooley et al . ( 2001 ) define process maturity as “…the extent to which a process is explicitly defined , managed , measured , and continuously improved” ( Dooley et al . , 2001 , p . 25 ) . Further , they find a positive correlation between higher levels of Christian Johansson 26 maturity and successfully performing projects that meet cost , schedule , and other organisational objectives . The US Department of Defense ( DoD ) initiated a focus onto the maturity of a software process as a way to curb development costs ( which were growing at annual rate of 12 % during mid to late 1980s ) and to manage budget overruns and quality issues attributed to software ( Humphrey , 1987 ) . Because so many systems are intertwined with software , the successful deployment of these systems depends greatly on the quality of the software code ( Humphrey , 1987 ) . Therefore , the Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon University ( SEI , 2009 ) , which was founded by the DoD to deal with software related issues , has developed a maturity based scale to characterise the software development process , and to prescribe target areas and actions for how companies can develop their own software development processes and thus make them more mature . The maturity scale , called the Capability Maturity Model ( CMM ) ( Paulk et al . , 1993 ) ( see Figure 8 ) , is based on five maturity levels ( initial , repeatable , defined , managed , and optimised ) ( Paulk et al . , 1993 ) to gradually develop the process by defining , managing , measuring , and continually improving the activities in the process . These improvements are introduced into the companies at different stages , since the idea is that a company will gradually develop their capabilities and climb the maturity levels step - by - step . The steps are achieved by applying a number of key process areas , see Figure 9 , which prescribe areas of improvement efforts that companies have to master to say that they have improved their CMM level . Figure 8 . Capability Maturity Model , adapted from ( Paulk et al . , 1993 ) . This work eventually developed into and was superseded by the Capability Maturity Model Integrated ( CMMI ) ( CMMI Product Team , 2001 ) , which mainly aimed to improve the integration of several process improvement initiatives . However , the CMM is still the theoretical backbone to these efforts .

CMM & CMMI view as understood by NASA , adopted from ( Salas et al . , 2003 ) . 3 . 6 . 4 Research & Development Degree of Difficulty NASA developed the conceptual tool called Research & Development Degree of Difficulty ( R & D 3 ) ( Mankins , 2002 , Mankins , 1998 ) , where the idea is to assess the effort needed to reach a certain level of TRL and this measure should complement the existing TRL metric in NASA’s processes . As development begins a number of parallel paths are used to mitigate risk , with a high - risk project needing more parallel paths to keep the options open , and less risk requiring fewer paths . With the help of R & D 3 , the idea is that the appropriate number of paths can be decided upon . Table 1 , below , describes the R & D3 scale . The scale fills the purpose of distinguishing between for instance interpolations and basic research efforts at both ends of the scale . For instance , a technology may be closely related to another ( mature ) technology , but because the environment of its usage has drastically changed , it drops several levels on the TRL scale . Elevating it up to the targeted TRL level is in this case relatively easy compared to a whole new systems development , as reflected with the R & D3 concept , and thus resources can be deployed accordingly .

Knowledge Maturity as Decision Support in Stage - Gate Product Development 29 4 SUMMARY OF APPENDED PAPERS This chapter provides a summary of the appended papers in this thesis , a summary of the main results , their relation to the thesis , and my role in the division of work between the authors in the papers . 4 . 1 Paper A Ericson , Å . , Bergström , M . , Johansson , C . and Larsson , T . ( 2007 ) On the way to knowledge awareness in early design . In proceedings of 17th CIRP design conference , Berlin , D . 607 - 616 . Summary Paper A is based on a study using future workshop ( Kensing and Madsen , 1991 ) for data collection . The focus is on decision support for the development of total offers ( Alonso - Rasgado et al . , 2004 ) , or product - service systems ( Mont , 2002 ) , and investigates the need for a computer - based tool to support a Go / No - Go decision of whether or not a company should offer a product as a total offer . The paper suggests a total offer readiness level ( TORL ) tool , based on the technology readiness level ( TRL ) , with a focus on knowledge maturity . To confidently offer a product - service system to a customer , the increased ambiguity that this brings needs to be handled , by being able to visualise the components’ knowledge maturity level . This gives decision makers a ‘seeing - first’ ( Mintzberg and Westley , 2001 ) perspective for their decision making , thus adding confidence . Tacit knowledge is an important factor in the context of total offers and a decision support tool needs to handle the tacit components of the decision base . The ambiguity early in the PSS’s lifecycle means that formalised data and information are scarce , leaving much of the decision making to a gut feeling and being able to rely on people with experience and expertise . Knowing who needs to attend a decision meeting is important , since it adds validity to the decisions and increases the chance that they will be followed through . Also important , a support tool for the decision making of total offers needs to support a wider set of parameters and knowledge areas ( e . g . business , design , manufacturing , etc . ) , since the total offer integrates all areas of the product’s lifecycle and not just the technical product development aspects . Knowledge maturity support needs to manage this and avoid integrating the areas into a single maturity thermometer . Christian Johansson 30 Relation to thesis This paper relates to the thesis because it highlights the complexity of dealing with ambiguity , especially in the early phases of a product development project when knowledge and information are scarce , and decisions still needs to be made . Hence , it points to the importance of gut feeling and experience , where a decision support needs to be capable of supporting this intangible and tacit aspect of the knowledge base . Further , it highlights knowledge maturity as a possible solution . Division of work between authors All authors developed the material in collaborating , planning and conducting the research .

( 2008 ) Gated Maturity Assessment : Supporting Gate Review Decisions with Knowledge Maturity Assessment . Presented at CIRP Design Conference 2008 , April 7 - 9 2008 , Twente , NL . Summary This paper reports on an exploratory research effort based on four workshops where the respondents aided in the development of a knowledge maturity demonstrator tool by providing concrete feedback on the development iterations of the tool . This tool is supposed to be used to support a gated rapid offer development process that is modelled from a stage - gate structure with stages and gates . The model is used in an aerospace context when an offer is to be prepared for a prospective customer . This process is a condensed version of the product development process , i . e . they need to know what they will develop and that they can do it within certain time and cost frames . The idea is that a knowledge maturity tool , termed Gated Maturity Assessment , will be able support decision making in the gated process and thus reach the required level of knowledge faster , accelerating the process to reach the 7 - day target that this new process should have . The GMA tool bases the assessment of knowledge maturity on three dimensions : input , method , and experience / expertise , thus covering aspects of input data , refinement tools and methods , and people . This work shows promise in dealing with the knowledge aspect , how well people know what they know , and in dealing with assumptions . Basically , the ‘focus - light’ shines on the knowledge , which people have to reflect upon , and articulate how well they know what they are bringing into a decision . This shows promise in asserting confidence for decision makers . Knowledge Maturity as Decision Support in Stage - Gate Product Development 31 Relation to thesis This paper’s relation to the thesis is that it reports on the initial development of a knowledge maturity tool consisting of a narrative criteria scale . Further , the main dimensions on which to assess knowledge maturity ( e . g . input , method and experience / expertise ) are first identified in this paper . Finally , the need for a generic base scale , to be developed by the stakeholders to fit the specific contexts of whatever is assessed , is also identified as an important part of a knowledge maturity tool . Division of work between authors In this paper , I planned and performed most of the study and data collection , and most of the writing . Andreas Larsson , Tobias Larsson and Ola Isaksson provided valuable feedback and comments during the data collection , analysis and writing . 4 . 3 Paper C Johansson , C . , Parida , V . , and Larsson , A . ( 2009 ) How are Knowledge and Information Evaluated ? - Decision Making in Stage - Gate Processes . In proceedings of The 17th International Conference on Engineering Design , Stanford , CA , USA . Summary This paper explores the state - of - practice in industry regarding the usage of knowledge and information at gates in the stage - gate process , and reports on a descriptive study with semi - structured interviews that target the ‘as - is’ situation at the case companies in their development processes . The results indicate that the principle areas of interest in the current processes are mainly related to the assessment of performance ( mainly technical ) and function that is to be achieved in the products . In this context , relatively little attention is given to assess the quality or maturity of the knowledge base , but essentially how well they know what they know . Further , tacit knowledge and gut feeling are aspects of the knowledge base that play an important role , but neither is dealt with structurally . It is difficult to distinguish unproven knowledge , such as assumptions , from ‘strong’ knowledge . A conclusion from the analysis is that there are opportunities to strengthen the knowledge base with a support that focuses on assessing and supporting the use of knowledge maturity . Further , from our study , the rational and relentless decision making that Cooper ( 2008 ) , the founder of stage - gate , advocates are evidently difficult to find in a project in a mature phase . There are examples of projects stopping before they start , basically being terminated at the entry point of the process , though once they are allowed to start , they will generally not be stopped . By then , the commitments of the companies are too strong . In one of the companies , contracts are signed among all the extended enterprise partners when they begin , which are very hard to terminate . Basically , the respondents talk of pragmatic solutions to decision making and process execution , where they try to appreciate and manage the risk of proceeding with a project that is not ready to Christian Johansson 32 pass a gate . In this case , the respondents devise action plans to manage delays and thereby facilitate and help the projects through the process , instead of stopping the projects , as Cooper advocates , when they do not show enough benefit . Therefore , this needs to be investigated further and support for this situation should be elaborated from a knowledge maturity perspective . Relation to thesis This paper is related to the thesis because it reports on the current status of the decision making process , the stage - gate process . It identifies the lack of knowledge support in dealing with uncertainty , and about an intriguing approach to decision making at the gates , where they have a somewhat pragmatic approach to the gate criteria and the decisions that need to be made . Since keeping pace is important , they need to make apparent satisficing decisions , allowing uncertainty and ambiguity into the decision base . Division of work between authors In this paper , I planned and performed most of the study and data collection , and all of the writing . Vinit Parida and Andreas Larsson contributed with comments and to discussions throughout the process . Of note that I performed this study in collaboration with Vinit , where his parts on Open Innovation were reported in another paper . 4 . 4 Paper D Johansson , C . ( 2009 ) Exploring the Need of a Knowledge Maturity Approach to Support Decision Making in Gated Product Development . Submitted Journal . Summary This paper starts with paper C and continues the investigation into the stage - gate process in the aerospace company . It investigates the additional role of the stage - gate as a valuable support for the teams , and identifies its role as a boundary object . Further , the knowledge sharing and negotiations that occur in the stage - gate resemble more that of a boundary negotiating artefact or an intermediary object , where the boundaries are negotiated while new knowledge is synthesised from people’s different perceptions of the knowledge base . By thinking of the stage - gate as a boundary object , this is a way for teams to deal with the state of bounded rationality that is common in the stage - gate processes in practice , where information and knowledge are sometimes scarce for the team to make decisions with the desired confidence to move past a gate . Having to advance with some degree of ambiguity and uncertainty , the stage - gate proves to be valuable not only because it is a tool for decision making , but also for its usefulness as the common denominator that the boundary object represents . Further , this paper also identifies the role of knowledge maturity as a boundary object that supports the management of uncertainty and ambiguity , identified as one of the reasons behind the pragmatic approach to decision making in the stage - gate process in the case company . Knowledge Maturity as Decision Support in Stage - Gate Product Development 33 Relation to thesis This paper relates to the thesis because it investigates the current usage of the stage - gate and its role in relation to handling issues , such as ambiguities and uncertainties in the decision bases . It investigates the opportunities to support the stakeholders in the gate meetings with a knowledge maturity approach . In conclusion , there are opportunities for the stage - gate , to utilise the knowledge maturity approach as a boundary object to facilitate discussion and communication of issues relating to ambiguity and uncertainty as well as dealing with assumptions .

However , my supervisors , Andreas Larsson and Marco Bertoni , provided valuable feedback and coaching , reviewing the paper throughout its creation . 4 . 5 Paper E Johansson , C . , Hicks , B . , Larsson , A . , Bertoni , M . ( 2009 ) Development of Knowledge Maturity Scales to Support PSS Development in the Aerospace Sector . Submitted to Journal . Summary This paper revisits previous results on knowledge maturity and explores a practical decision support tool that aims to increase the decision makers’ awareness and understanding of the current status of the knowledge base that they draw upon when making decisions . The purpose of the knowledge maturity tool is to provide the users ( i . e . stakeholders in the gate reviews ) with an increased awareness of the status of information and knowledge handled at the gate , highlighting ambiguities and uncertainties in the process and supporting the team in taking actions to mitigate risk from a knowledge perspective . The knowledge maturity tool is developed on the basis of a generic narrative knowledge maturity scale that was already introduced in paper B . The scale considers three basic dimensions , specifically input , method / tool and experience / expertise for the assessment of the knowledge base maturity . The paper discusses the importance of such dimensions and explains how the value associated with these dimensions may alter the decision makers’ level of confidence at the gate . The paper guides the reader through the process of preparing such a criteria scale and adapting it to the working context of the knowledge asset to be assessed . Finally , some thoughts on the hands - on application of the knowledge maturity tool in the gate reviews are also provided , discussing how stakeholders in the stage - gate process can use the concept of knowledge maturity to deal more effectively with uncertainty and ambiguity in the stage - gate process . Christian Johansson 34 Relation to thesis This paper is related to the thesis because it presents an approach for working with knowledge maturity in the stage - gate process and for its abiltiy to highlight the assumptions , ambiguities and uncertainties in the decision base . Division of work between authors The main idea behind the knowledge maturity framework and guideline was mine , where I set the focus of the paper , and did most of the writing . The contributions of Ben Hicks , Andreas Larsson and Marco Bertoni included valuable comments , input and concrete writing of the paper . Knowledge Maturity as Decision Support in Stage - Gate Product Development 35 5 AEROSPACE INDUSTRY The majority of the work undertaken during my Ph . D . studies and reported in this thesis has related to the aerospace industry context . As uncovered in this work , the aerospace context varies in many ways from other contexts ( e . g . automotive , consumer products , etcetera . ) . Therefore , this section aims to give the reader an introduction based on my personal observations and the literature . Becket ( 2002 ) presents a comparison ( see Table 2 ) of how the aerospace industry has developed and transformed from its early days , when the main incentives were to develop airplanes that flew higher , faster and farther almost regardless of the costs ( Murman et al . , 2000 ) , into a more cost aware industry . At one point , coinciding with the end of the cold war around 1990 , the cost of maintaining the chase for performance - related mantras was too high and no longer as important : hence , the switch to a more conscious and sustainable thinking also arrived in the aerospace domain ( Murman et al . , 2000 ) . Before this point , the aerospace industry , which has also been greatly involved in the defence industries , performed much of their product development with government support , since it was important to stay ahead of other nations in the race for technological advantage ( Murman et al . , 2000 ) . With a gradual switch to a low - cost airline market , product requirements became different . Cost , quality and value considerations over an entire lifecycle were more important to deal with . Here , concepts like PSS ( Mont , 2002 ) and Power by the Hour / Total Care ( TotalCare , 2009 ) are the new aspects to make the aerospace market more sustainable in this new era ( Murman et al . , 2000 ) . Table 2 . Evolution of aerospace in recent years , adapted from ( Beckett , 2002 ) . Market reach Dominantmarketsector Typicalproductionscope Company I . P . contribution Pre - 1990’s Domestic Defence aerospace Limited quantities of whole aircraft , short - term production Other people’s designs and productionconcepts Post - 1990 Global Commercialaerospace Larger quantities of parts of aircraft , long - term production Company detail design and productionconcepts Christian Johansson 36 The products manufactured in the aerospace industry normally fall within what has been defined as Complex Products and Systems ( Acha et al . , 2004 , Acha et al . , 2007 , Hobday , 1998 ) , termed as high - cost , engineering intensive products , systems , networks and constructs ( Hobday , 1998 ) . “The term ‘complex’ is used to denote the high number of customized components , the breadth of the knowledge and skills required , and the extent of new knowledge involved in development and production . ” ( Acha et al . , 2004 , p . 507 ) The development of these products requires large investments compared to many other industries . The purchasing price of the products—for instance , the estimated price of an Airbus A380 in 2008 was around $ 327 million ( Flightglobal . com , 2008 ) —also forces developers to be slightly unconventional in how they sell the products , e . g . with the use of discounts , as much as 70 % off the list price of an aero engine ( Buxton et al . , 2006 ) , and thus earning the main profit on after market activities ( i . e . maintenance , repair and overhaul ) . This implies longer payback times , sometimes as long as 10 years before cash flow from customers equals spending on development ( Buxton et al . , 2006 ) . Another approach is the various product and service bundled offerings ( Alonso - Rasgado et al . , 2004 , Mont , 2002 ) , i . e . Total Care , where customers pay for the use of the product and buy the required function when needed from the manufacturers . Given these challenges , companies are preferring to team up in partnerships with each other to manage the risks , investments and skill challenges ( Prencipe , 2004 ) , in risk and revenue sharing agreements , which adds another degree of complexity to the situation . For instance , the Boeing 787 Dreamliner development team consists of 50 first tier suppliers and risk and revenue sharing partners ( Boeing Commercial Airplanes , 2009 ) . Examples of partnerships are the extended ( Boardman and Clegg , 2001 , Browne and Zhang , 1999 , Ericksen and Suri , 2001 ) and virtual enterprises ( Browne and Zhang , 1999 , Davidow and Malone , 1993 , Hardwick and Bolton , 1997 ) . A practical example in aerospace is the Engine Alliance ( Engine Alliance Public Website , 2008 ) between General Electric Aircraft Engines and Pratt & Whitney , co - developers of the GP7000 , one of the engine alternatives for the Airbus A380 . The terms show collaborative partnerships where companies team up to share workload , resources , knowledge , risk and investments . Hence , individual companies can focus on their core ( i . e . value creating ) knowledge and leave the other areas to their partners to focus on . Also , by collaborating they can take on initiatives that would otherwise have been impossible , since the business case would not be viable for one manufacturer alone . This was the main reason for the Engine Alliance partnership , when neither of the companies found a viable business case to conduct the project alone . However , the market opportunity was still significant enough to not to abandon it , hence they found a solution in teaming up together ( Engine Alliance Public Website , 2008 ) . “Each company had independently forecast worldwide demand for aircraft in this market segment and determined that it might not be large enough to Knowledge Maturity as Decision Support in Stage - Gate Product Development 37 justify the approximate $ 1 Billion cost to develop a new - centerline engine . Still , the market segment and potential customer base were too large to ignore . ” ( Engine Alliance Public Website , 2008 ) The main difference between virtual and extended enterprises lies in the longevity and agility of the partnerships ( Browne and Zhang , 1999 ) , where virtual enterprises are short - term and disband upon completion of a project , whereas the extended enterprise can be stable over multiple projects . Companies teaming up in these partnerships as collaborators are at the same time competitors . This phenomenon is called coopetition ( Brandenburger et al . , 1995 ) , depicting the coexistence competitive and a cooperative atmosphere . Product development in aerospace is contract - driven , i . e . before any commitments are made and before any real development work starts , a binding contract is signed regarding delivery to the customer and other partners . This aspect is relatively unique compared to many other industries ( e . g . automotive , consumer products , etc . ) , where the product is first built and then sold . Conversely , in the aerospace context the product is first sold and then it is built , i . e . they are committed to the contracts they sign and are obliged to see the program through and actually deliver on time to avoid breaching the contracts in place . As one of the respondents in paper D stated : “…we have already sold what we are developing . ” Before they sign these contracts , the incentive to terminate a project is at its highest . This is because the commitment is relatively low , with companies doing their homework to ensure that the business case is viable and that technologies and other developments needed for the project are in place to mitigate the risk that they take by going into the binding contracts . As one of the respondents from paper D said : “There is a breakpoint when you enter a contract . Before this breakpoint we do work to assess the risk that we take . ” Very little ambiguity and “freedom” are permitted once in the project . This has to be taken care of beforehand ; hence , aerospace companies spend much effort on R & D and conduct technology development outside of live product development projects . As discovered in paper C , when the technology is in a state of maturity that relates to the technology readiness levels ( TRLs ) between 1 and 6 , the technologies and methods are matured in various research projects . Only thereafter , when deemed mature enough to move into the product development phase are they adapted for specific products and systems . 5 . 1 Scenario : A Stage - Gate Process in Aerospace Based on the understanding gained from several data collection activities , this section aims to describe how the stage - gate process may look in an aerospace company , from the perspective of working through an arbitrary stage and gate . From a focal company perspective , the stakeholders in this process are : • the project team , consisting of members , experts and a project leader , and Christian Johansson 38 • the management group , consisting of managers from various functions concerned with the outcome of the decisions made in the gate meeting . • Further , in these projects there are always customers and partners who are directly dependant on the performance of the focal company in the project . These partner companies are sometimes in direct contact with the project leader and other people in the company . Additionally , at certain times in the process , the project leader will attend gate reviews at their customer ( i . e . engine integrator ) to answer for the developments ( i . e . aero engine components ) that the focal company provides to the whole product ( i . e . aero engine ) , and which the engine integrator integrates . During the stage , various activities are taking place in the project , as stipulated in the process description , including design work , various analysis activities , business case related activities , etc . Performing these activities are engineers specialised in different areas and other experts with expert knowledge regarding specific methods and functions , such as purchasing , manufacturing , production , and strength and aerodynamics simulation analysis , to name a few . All activities are reported in the deliverables , i . e . documents used for documentation and as a basis for decisions in the gates . Apart from the technical reports , a condensed version of this information is summarised and compiled in a summary document , called a project assurance plan ( PAP ) , which is the main document in the gate . The PAP document is structured in accordance with the criteria that the gate is concerned with , i . e . the project leader fills out the file answering to his / her perception of the gate criteria and adds rationale to it by summarising information from other information carriers . As the gate review approaches , the documents and any other information are sent to the management group in due course ahead of the gate , typically at least two weeks ahead of time , so that those evaluating the information have time to prepare . Since the technical part can be very comprehensive , the evaluation process is divided into two meetings . A technical review is initially carried out , with various experts from the company , external to the project , evaluating the technical solutions and progress . Their recommendation then serves as input to the gate meeting , and together with the other evaluation criteria are brought into the decision . Usually , the only person from the project team attending the gate meeting is the project leader , to represent and answer for the results of the project . If necessary , experts answering for specific areas may participate in either the gate meeting or the technical review meeting . The management group evaluate the project , primarily focusing their attention on the PAP file containing the criteria as agreed in the previous gate and a summary of the results to match the criteria . The main criteria are related to the performance and function of the product , whether the business case holds or not , and whether the needed weight or thrust will be met , to name a few . When things are unclear or more information is needed , they will review the other documentation more carefully and ask questions to the project leader or expert concerned . Essentially , the gate meeting is a Q & A between the Knowledge Maturity as Decision Support in Stage - Gate Product Development 39 management group and the project leader ( and perhaps some other team member ) , to evaluate the project and dig deeper into areas that are unclear . Here , there is a challenge in making judgements , since which decision to make is not often obvious . Once the decision is to be made , there are three options . The first is Go , marked green in the PAP file , i . e . things are ok and the targets have been met . The second is Rework / Improve , marked yellow in the PAP file , i . e . an action plan is created to catch up the specific area at the same time as the next gate . This is understood to be a rather common option , albeit most of the time , the actions are quite minor . These activities are completed together with the next phase , adding to the workload and sometimes requiring more resources . Finally , the Terminate / Stop option , marked red in the PAP file , means that the project will stop immediately . This option is rare in running projects , since the company signs contracts to develop products . Instead , a common option is to flag yellow when the decision point is not good enough to make a Go - decision , returning an action to the team . The main reason for the terminate option would be if flight safety regulations are not met , or if it is anticipated that a mandatory certification test will fail . Being unable to fulfil their commitments is usually not a reason for a company to break a contractual agreement , which if still terminated , the company will be liable to their customers and partners major compensation . Therefore , the main understanding is that things can be caught up and covered within the scope of the running project . The decision point is then flagged as yellow and an action plan is created with dates for when the changes or improvements are due and to be controlled by the management group . However , before projects receive a go - ahead and before contracts are signed , the incentive to stop project initiatives that do not show enough promise is great , which makes the option of flagging red more common and attractive during the early stages of a project initiative , mainly at the first gate , when they do feasibility studies are conducted and they have to decide how to answer a proposal request . The gate also has an influence on decision making regarding the next stage , adapting the plan to move forward based on the current status . For instance , if there are many actions that require a lot of work , it might be necessary to add some extra resources or prioritise these activities . Christian Johansson 40 6 KNOWLEDGE MATURITY AS A DECISION SUPPORT IN STAGE - GATE PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT This chapter presents the main empirical results of my thesis , focusing on the role of the gate in decision making , dealing with knowledge and information as well as ambiguities and uncertainties . Further , the knowledge maturity concept , with a suggested tool for how stakeholders in the stage - gate can work with issues of ambiguity and uncertainty in the decision base , is also presented . 6 . 1 Role of the Gate While briefly described in the stage - gate scenario from the previous chapter , the role of the gate will be examined more closely in this section . When investigating the state - of - practice regarding the role of the gate as in papers C and D , the gate has a somewhat different role compared to that prescribed as the norm in literature ( Cooper , 2001 , Cooper , 2008 ) . Product development projects in a mature phase , i . e . having passed the initial feasibility studies and been given the go ahead and commitment to be seen through , appear to lack the hard rational decision making that Cooper ( 2001 , 2008 ) advocates . The kill decisions , as prescribed by Cooper , on decision points that do not meet the acceptance criterion , are rare in the gate decision making investigated in papers C and D . In Cooper’s words , the gates seem to ‘lack teeth’ ( Cooper , 2008 ) . The gates fill a different role in the companies investigated . Instead of terminating projects , the decision making in the case companies , from papers C and D , mainly has a pragmatic character . Therefore , instead of terminating or temporarily stopping projects , the decision points are flagged yellow and action plans are devised for the teams to catch up within a given time - frame . The main reason to put projects on hold is when flight regulations are involved , and the criterion at the gates relates to flight safety . For instance , if a flight certification test needs to be done and the decision is whether or not to go ahead with the test , the team needs to be assured that the test will be conducted , since a failed test will nonetheless result in rework and the investments and costs in conducting these tests are so high that there is no point in the company taking a chance . From the studies in papers C and D , it appears that by passing the first gate the projects pass a sort of “point of no return” , i . e . beyond this point it is basically too late to stop a project , and therefore it will proceed until completion , when a Knowledge Maturity as Decision Support in Stage - Gate Product Development 41 product is launched . In company A from papers C and D in the aerospace domain , this point is when a contract is signed with customers and partners , and obliging them to stick with their commitment and finish the contract . Breaching a contractual agreement is expensive and would also label them as an unreliable partner ; hence , it is rare that they will resort to this option . Rather , they will do their utmost to stick with their commitments , even though it would sometimes be better for the specific case and project to walk away . This also applies to any delays relating to their partners , where not being able to make a delivery implies that a breach contract terms and thus will incur penalties . Therefore , it is often better to make a pragmatic decision and keep pace with the other partners in the partnership , catching up as soon as possible . As a reference , the point of no return in the metalworking industry found in paper C was possibly to leave quite late , when substantial investments are made , though they would normally see through what they started . In paper C , the perspective of the pragmatics inherent in the gate decisions was discovered , where decisions and components that do not meet the gate criteria are flagged yellow , and the projects proceed through the gates . The companies are pragmatic in trying to deal with the risks by letting decisions pass through , only after catch - up actions are devised and agreed by all stakeholders . These issues are , as one respondent puts it , “no showstoppers” . It is important to be a good collaborator , and not inflict delays on the partner companies and the customer . It should be noted though , that the pragmatic decisions also brings ambiguity and uncertainty along in the decision base , that needs to be handled in future decisions to ensure confidence for the decision makers . Figure 10 shows how the pragmatic approach decisions found in papers C and D , as outcome of the descriptive study , in relation to the approach advocated by Cooper ( 2001 , 2008 ) . The size of the bars is not representative of the amount of either type of decision , due to the unavailability of this kind of data . This view is mainly applicable for gate decision making in an aerospace context , given the lack of kill - decisions ( i . e . the dotted line around that box ) found as well as the tendency to opt for conditional go - decisions , with actions to continually progress in the projects . Apart from advocating kill - decisions , Cooper also thinks that a project should not be given resources to move forward unless all acceptance criteria are met , i . e . the recycle and hold options imply that the project stops at the gate until all criteria are met and the project is green . In practice , this option also tends to be given the conditional go - decision with actions . The main reason for stopping a project would be if , for example , flight safety is at risk , otherwise they will want to keep projects moving , which is what happens in most of the cases . Christian Johansson 42 Figure 10 . The pragmatic decision making approach versus the normative approach as prescribed by Cooper ( 2001 , 2008 ) . The character of the gate acceptance criterion advocated by Cooper ( 2008 ) relates to how solid the business case is , what the anticipated function of the product will be and what kind of performance will be extracted from it . The current gate criteria in the case companies were similar to the general focus areas advocated by Cooper , i . e . meeting specifications , and if time , cost and scheduling are satisfactory , albeit with priority given to the technical requirements on function and performance in the business case . A company committed to a project focuses on solving the technical issues , ensuring that the technical performance can be met , as required or expected . The role of knowledge as well as ambiguities and uncertainties are things that they do not focus on specifically . There is a level of implicit understanding of tacit knowledge in particular , where they are interested in who has done a certain work and who they can staff the projects with in an effort to gather the dream team to every project . An experienced team has a positive influence on the end result , because they know the pitfalls and where extra effort and resources are needed to reach a satisfactory conclusion . However , once at the gates they assume that the project team will learn about the product and little attention is given to the quality or maturity of the knowledge base . As one respondent in paper C stated : “…it’s [ … ] assumed that the people [ … ] learn [ … ] and that they build up their personal knowledge and this is reused in the next project [ … ] But it’s very much their own knowledge…” Therefore , there are no formalised acceptance criteria that stipulate what the quality of the knowledge base should be to make a confident decision . From the study in paper C , there are opportunities to work more towards handling this aspect in the stage - gate process , since both companies see the benefits from being able to assess knowledge from the beginning of a project . 6 . 2 Stage - gate as a boundary negotiating artefact From paper D , the stage - gate evidently has a coordinative role among the people in the projects who work on different areas that have intersecting interests and dependencies . Using the stage - gate and its criteria , they can then Knowledge Maturity as Decision Support in Stage - Gate Product Development 43 reflect on and communicate among themselves the status of their work and where they are , and what they need to do to make sure that things are all right . Engwall et al . ( 2005 ) found that one of the reasons why formalised product development models like the stage - gate are so popular in companies is because they facilitate a common way of working , communicating and making sense of situations . Process models provide a framework that enables communication . According to Engwall et al . ( 2005 ) , the models are a vehicle for collective procedures and he uses the analogy of a boundary object ( Star and Griesemer , 1989 ) to enable coordination between individuals with different conceptions of the development task ( Engwall et al . , 2005 ) . The findings from this work ( primarily from paper D ) confirm this understanding of the stage - gate as a support for communication . From a knowledge perspective in dealing with ambiguity and uncertainty , the findings in paper D suggest that this process is more dynamic , not only about communicating the status between team members . A strength of the stage - gate , as perceived by the case company in paper D , was that it allowed team members to bring their perceptions to the table and challenge and defend perceptions of the knowledge assets . This meant that what they actually did was negotiate and reinterpret ( Lutters and Ackerman , 2007 ) the boundaries of people’s perception of the knowledge base . Therefore , the boundary object concept can be conceived as too static . This process means that the artefacts resemble what Lee ( 2007 ) calls boundary negotiating artefacts , which are also a subset of coordinative artefacts ( Schmidt and Wagner , 2002 ) , or boundary objects . Figure 11 shows the idea of approaching the stage - gate process as a coordinative artefact . The three - dimensional aspect of the figure depicts that all three view the artefact from their own side , without seeing what the others see , and not seeing the same thing , i . e . they see different perspectives of the knowledge base . A discussion must be conducted as they share their perception of the knowledge base , which then brings the whole understanding forward . Figure 11 . Stage - gate as a coordinative artefact . Christian Johansson 44 In addition to managing projects and making decisions , the stage - gate serves as an artefact that the stakeholders can gather around and use to aid communication , discussion and negotiation about the knowledge base , challenging the boundaries of each member’s perception of the knowledge assets that he or she brings to the gate . The stage - gate becomes a common denominator for the stakeholders that can be used to visualise progress and bring the status of the project to table , i . e . what knowledge do they have , what knowledge is missing , and what knowledge do they need to bring to feel confident about the knowledge base ? Looking beyond the face value of the documents and other pieces of information and knowledge brought up at these meetings enables a sharing of knowledge between team members , offering an opportunity to synthesize knowledge provided by various stakeholders , and creating new knowledge . This further enables them to guide the projects forward . The negotiation of the boundaries , as perceived by team members , in conflict with other team members’ perceptions allows them to create new knowledge by synthesizing their beliefs . Basically they have an intermediary object ( Boujut and Blanco , 2003 ) that represents the knowledge they have about the future product , which supports knowledge creation as it matures , from immature to mature knowledge , through the intermediary states of the product . 6 . 3 Knowledge Maturity A result from paper B was the concept of knowledge maturity to support decision making in a gated process . Knowledge maturity is a concept that can highlight the status of knowledge going into the gate – what the team knows , what do not know and what they need to know . In paper A , the concept of knowledge maturity was already identified as an area that supports decision making in the development of total offers and PSS . The Total Offer Readiness Level is a conceptual idea that gives an overview of the knowledge maturity level of the many diverse components in a PSS . Knowledge maturity is about putting knowledge at the centre of attention to allow aspects regarding the quality of the knowledge base as well as the customary aspects of performance and function to feature in the deliberations of the decisions taken in gates . This way , it is possible to assess what the team really knows about the results they take to the gate and their learning about the product they are developing . It is about knowing what is known and what is unknown as opposed to not knowing what is known and unknown . A strength with the knowledge maturity concept is that engineers have to relate their perception and understanding to the bigger picture , by reflecting upon how much they have learned and know about the product in relation to how much they should know at a given stage to feel confident . Continuous reflection is an important ingredient when learning about the product and gaining knowledge about why solutions are the way they are . Knowledge Maturity as Decision Support in Stage - Gate Product Development 45 A principle aspect with knowledge maturity is that it can help the team in highlight uncertainties and ambiguities in the knowledge base . Similarly , the concept of knowledge maturity can also assist in the identification and assessment of assumptions that are ingrained in the process . Sometimes , often in the early stages , many decisions are based on knowledge from the gut feelings of experienced team members that fill a spot in the knowledge base as placeholder values ( Flanagan et al . , 2007 ) , until they can be replaced or improved through concrete results from the team’s activities . However , there is a risk that these placeholder values are mistaken for proven knowledge and facts and this is where the opportunity arises to highlight these assumptions , using the knowledge maturity approach . Without the knowledge maturity concept , stakeholders are faced with a reduced understanding of the ambiguity and uncertainty in the knowledge base . Merely focusing on the performance related aspects means that the team will only have access to the numbers , but not the quality of the knowledge behind these numbers , why they are the way they are and with what level of confidence the team can say that the numbers are correct and will be transferable to the end product from the production line . Further , as highlighted in paper C , the decision makers will not have a structured way of distinguishing assumptions from verified facts . Especially in the beginning of projects , decisions are made based on the assumptions and gut feelings of experienced team members as placeholders for future improvements . With a knowledge maturity approach , distinguishing the placeholders from the verified facts and supporting the team in dealing with the assumptions are possible . With knowledge maturity , it is also possible to look beyond the face value of the documents , i . e . the information and results brought to a gate , and not only focus on aspects relating to the numbers , such as performance , function , etcetera . With this approach , it is possible to assess the knowledge behind the numbers and to understand the background of a certain number and with what level of accuracy and confidence that number can be true . By understanding the knowledge base better , the team can possibly assess in which areas the knowledge assets are of sufficient quality for a particular decision point , compared to in which areas the knowledge assets are of inferior quality and should be improved . Hence , it is possible to support the utilisation of knowledge , to focus the efforts where they are best spent and avoid doing ‘too much’ work , or over - do , on areas where the knowledge base is sufficient to make a confident decision regarding the safe opening of a gate . Here , it is important to highlight that the knowledge maturity concept is not a magic silver bullet that solves the issue of having a decision base that does not reach the level of what is needed to open the gate ( i . e . flagging green ) . By highlighting the status of the knowledge base , including ambiguities and uncertainties , the team can prime for improvement efforts and make it possible for them to catch up . Highlighting ambiguities , uncertainties and immature Christian Johansson 46 knowledge is the first step towards mitigating risks by taking corrective action . However , a conditional go - decision with the inferior decision base and thus increased confidence can be made , because they now understand that it is inferior and where it is inferior . Confidence is a keyword in this work . In exploring the knowledge maturity concept , the main contribution of knowledge maturity is to provide confidence for decision makers . By making decision makers aware of the status of the knowledge that forms the decision base , whichever decision they make can be made with more confidence because they will have a better understanding of the strengths , weaknesses and limitations of the decision base . The knowledge maturity concept can thus support decision makers in making pragmatic decisions , an important aspect in the practical application of the stage - gate process . With an improved understanding of the knowledge base , decision makers have a better chance of appreciating the risk with moving forward , though all the acceptance criteria might not be fulfilled . Figure 12 , which depicts the outcome of the prescriptive study to support the descriptive results shown before , shows how knowledge maturity can support this pragmatic decision making situation . The idea is that with an understanding of the knowledge maturity level , the team will understand where they are in the conditional go space , and thus better understanding what kind of work efforts are needed to bring the level to a fully green level . This means that whether they choose to do the work or if they simply open the gate , they should be more confident , since they know more about the maturity and quality of the knowledge base as well as any of their uncertainties and ambiguities . Figure 12 . Knowledge maturity support for the pragmatic decision making in gates . From paper D , the knowledge maturity concept can be thought of as a boundary object that the team can use to negotiate and move the boundaries of their knowledge bases forward in the stage - gate process . It provides a way of Knowledge Maturity as Decision Support in Stage - Gate Product Development 47 visualising the knowledge base and facilitates discussions about assumptions , ambiguities and uncertainties . It works as a common denominator for the teams to communicate about knowledge and advancing the common knowledge base in the project . It is a structured way of triggering knowledge creation , by forcing members to assess their knowledge and discuss where perceptions differ , i . e . they can synthesise their perceptions and advance the knowledge base . A strength with this kind of approach is not its ability to assess the exact value of the maturity , but rather the fact that by having to assess and perhaps reach differing conclusions about the state of readiness of the knowledge base , they will have to discuss about what really is behind the face value of the documents . Graettinger et al . ( 2002 ) witnessed this as a major benefit with assessing TRLs in projects . In paper B , an assessment loop ( see Figure 13 ) was suggested for how a team should work with the knowledge maturity approach . Here , the work in the business process ( i . e . stage - gate process ) is performed and according to an acceptance criterion ( i . e . the required knowledge maturity ) , the work and the result are assessed and analysed , whereby a decision is made that results in actions of either moving ahead to the next gate or iterating the work from the phase ( albeit while moving ahead ) . The spiral depicts that the loop will not go back to the same activities in the business process after a decision and action , but that it will be new activities as part of the next stage . What has become particularly interesting , given the view of knowledge maturity as a boundary object , is the analysis activity conducted in the team ahead of the gate . Cooper ( 2008 ) also highlighted this activity in preparing the decision base for the gate and packaging the results into deliverables . This is the point where the team can discuss and share their perceptions of the knowledge base , elaborating where they are in relation to where they should be . Using the knowledge maturity concept as a boundary negotiating artefact , they can negotiate their perception of the knowledge and reach a common awareness of the knowledge used at the gate . Figure 13 . Assessment loop , adapted from paper B . Table 3 below , summarises the knowledge maturity aspects , providing short explanations to the main results . Christian Johansson 48 Table 3 . Summarising the knowledge maturity aspects . Knowledge at the centre of attention Add another dimension to the decision base . In addition to performance related acceptance criteria , the knowledge maturity concept will allow the team to make decisions based on the knowledge of the product , and what the team have learnt about it . Quality of decision base Have an understanding of the maturity of the knowledge base means that decision makers are aware of strengths and weaknesses related to what the team knows about the product . Knowledge of uncertainties and ambiguities Knowledge maturity enables the team to highlight uncertainties and ambiguities . Manage assumptions A focus on knowledge maturity forces assumptions to be assessed regarding the origin and what is the confidence level in them . Focus on both performance and knowledge By focusing on knowledge , it is possible to look behind face value of documents and understand the knowledge behind the numbers and results . Insights about what knowledge is enough and what knowledge is needed Knowing the status of the knowledge base enables the team to make improvement efforts , where they are needed . Confidence for decision makers With a better understanding of the knowledge base , decision makers can devise actions and make decisions based upon awareness of limitations of decision base . Support pragmatic decisions Make decisions based on knowledge of limits in decision base . Boundary object Knowledge maturity supports communication about knowledge base and sharing of knowledge . 6 . 3 . 1 Knowledge maturity tool In paper B a demonstrator tool for assessing knowledge maturity is presented , the Gated Maturity Assessment . This is then further developed in paper E as support for assessing knowledge maturity in the development of rapid proposals concerning PSSs . These developments were influenced by TRL and CMM , the two principle maturity frameworks used in industry . TRL and CMM provide complementary focus in assessing the readiness of the artefact itself ( i . e . the decision material ) and the process that the artefact was developed in , i . e . the procedures and the approach to develop the decision material . Knowledge Maturity as Decision Support in Stage - Gate Product Development 49 Three dimensions of knowledge maturity Further , to assess knowledge maturity , the assessment was divided into three complementary dimensions : input , method , and expertise / experience . Quality / maturity of input To assess the information that comes into the project from external sources to the project team because the quality of the input may have a profound influence of the quality and contents of the output . Quality / maturity of methods and tools To assess the tools , methods , and procedures that the project team make use to refine and transform whatever input information they have into a result for the gate . Companies often have a way of working or doing tasks that is specific to them , i . e . a company standard . Additionally , different methods provide different levels of confidence and different methods have different levels of cost attributed to them . It is about finding the best match for the decision to be made . Quality / maturity of expertise and experience To assess the people working in the stages , preparing the information and knowledge for the gates and compiling the deliverables that the management group will assess . The people doing the work will greatly influence the outcome of the work , as the results of paper C highlighted that an experienced and capable person usually finds the challenging areas easier than a novice , and thus can focus more attention to those aspects . For instance , the aerospace case company has a sort of insignias system , similar to a military insignia system , to formalise responsibilities and authorisation to perform certain tasks . These three dimensions can complement each other , i . e . if the methods and tools are not understood to be good enough , bringing in an expert with a higher expertise / experience level may still make the total assessment satisfactory . Similarly , a good tool or good input can spare the use of an expert for the benefit of other projects that might make better use of the expert as a resource . Seven requirements for a knowledge maturity tool In paper E , one contribution is a set of requirements for a knowledge maturity tool , which were synthesised based on the work in papers A - D . These requirements are presented here : 1 . Support for boundary negotiation Knowledge maturity needs to support the negotiation of boundaries seen in the stage - gate , allowing people to challenge each other’s perceptions of the knowledge base . 2 . Support for tacit knowledge sharing Knowledge maturity needs to support the assessment of expertise , and support the highlighting of experienced people who can have an influence on the decision material . Christian Johansson 50 3 . Support for learning Support for learning needs to be provided through the exploration of ‘what - if’ scenarios and ‘seeing first’ ( Mintzberg and Westley , 2001 ) approach to the implications of feedback from team members who elaborate on certain actions . 4 . Support for visualisation Visualisation of the knowledge maturity relative to the required level is needed , as it can act as a discussion that triggers the elaboration of future activities . 5 . Support for traceability It is important to trace individual factors and their knowledge maturity level in the whole PSS , thus being able to follow the individual component’s influence on the maturity of the total offer . 6 . Support for prioritisation Some areas in a total offer are bound to be more important than others . For instance , aerospace regulations and flight safety are important to aerospace companies and require close attention . From a knowledge maturity perspective , this must be supported to allow teams to focus their knowledge creation efforts on the areas that matter the most . 7 . Support for pragmatic decision making Knowledge maturity needs to support the elaboration of risk in taking loosely - based Go - decisions , i . e . differentiating between No - Go and Conditional - Go decisions based on the quality of the knowledge base . One result from paper E is also the identification of the need of complementary developments to the knowledge maturity criteria scales . There is also a need to develop rating and weighting functionalities as well as computer support tools to visualise knowledge maturity and to integrate the diverse parts of the total offer knowledge maturity . Knowledge maturity scales The knowledge maturity scales presented below were developed with cooperation of and assessed by people in industry , accustomed to working in development projects , while participating in workshops . The base of this development work is a generic knowledge maturity scale ; see Table 4 . The initial development took the main ideas behind the TRL and CMM concepts and developed them into a five - level criterion scale with a greater knowledge perspective on things . The base scale is intended to serve as a reference point that any future adaptation can begin from , i . e . whatever application is used , there is the same basic understanding of knowledge maturity and what constitutes a certain knowledge maturity level . This enforces its role as a boundary object , since it is easier to use it as a discussion facilitator . Of note that in the developments of the scales , levels 2 and 4 have been omitted as far as definition of criteria , to provide the teams with intermediary levels that can be used when perhaps all criteria for a level are not met to a fully adequate level . Knowledge Maturity as Decision Support in Stage - Gate Product Development 51 Table 4 . Generic knowledge maturity scale . 5 Excellent • The content and rationale is tested and proven . It reflects a known confidence regarding , for instance , risks . • The procedure to produce the content and rationale reflects an approach where tried out methods are used and where workers continually reflect and improve . • Lessons learnt are recorded . 4 Good 3 Acceptable • The content and rationale is more standardized and defined ( i . e . documented and formalised ) . • There is a greater extent of detailing and definition . • The procedure to produce the content and rationale is more stable ( compared to previous levels ) with an element of standardization and repeatability . 2 Dubious 1 Inferior • Content and rationale is characterized by instability ( e . g . poor / no understanding of knowledge base ) . • The procedure to produce the content and rationale is dependant on individuals and formalized methods are non - existent . After the base scale was developed , the scale was adapted to fit the three dimensions and essentially create criteria for three scales in one , i . e . one for each dimension ; see Table 5 . This provides a solid base to start any effort of adapting the criteria to specific contexts . Table 5 . Generic scales for input , method , experience . Input Method Experience 5 Excellent Input is detailed and verified Tested , standardised and verified methods that are under continuous review and development Long verified experience and expertise within area of concern 4 Good 3 Acceptable Input is available in detailed form , but is not verified Standardised and tested methods have been used . Proven experience and competence within area of concern 2 Dubious 1 Inferior Risk of incorrect input Untried methods have been used ( ad - hoc ) Person doing the work is inexperienced ( first time ) While the more generic scales are useful , it is of more benefit for the development team to adapt the knowledge maturity criteria to the working context of the task at hand . Essentially , this means creating their own scales , in their own natural language , to what they are accustomed to , from the generic definitions with criteria . The scales are therefore adapted specifically to the specific working context , making it easier to assess what actions needs to be taken , e . g . which methods are specifically mature in the working context , which competences are needed , and what input data with which quality are needed . This process requires input from experts accustomed in working with the specific context to contribute and make the assessment of what are appropriate definitions for the specific knowledge maturity levels . Table 6 , below , shows an example of a contextualised scale for a market assessment scenario . Based on the generic base scale from Table 5 , above , and the assistance from several experts on market assessment , the scale was created to support the assessment of knowledge maturity in a specific market assessment Christian Johansson 52 case in a stage - gate process . With my assistance , the experts related the maturity definitions to their every day working environment , relating to prior cases in performing market assessment . Table 6 . Contextualized scale for market assessment . Input Method Experience / expertise 5 Excellent Very good quality of input data with assessment by customer as well as several independent sources Developed support system for risk assessment regarding future volume and prices Long verified experience and expertise within area of concern 4 Good 3 Acceptable Market survey based solely on data from customer Systematic modus operandi with qualitative risk assessment regarding prices and volume Proven experience and competence within area of concern 2 Dubious 1 Inferior Data from customer and independent sources is missing No evaluation of external data Person doing the work is inexperienced ( first time ) Here , a validation process with independent people acting as reviewers of the scale definitions being developed is also needed , to ensure that the definitions are kept at the right level and that the scales are not tweaked too much and become useless . Further , an iteration process with the management group to decide and allow the scales to be used as criteria in the next gate is needed , especially where the decision component represents a high stake in the company , or where an accurate decision is ‘mission critical’ , i . e . that confidence mirrors a truly correct decision . Once at the gate making a decision , there is a need for acceptance criteria that represent the knowledge level needed to make a go - decision . This can be visualised in a pass profile ( from paper B ) , which represents the level of maturity needed : see Figure 14 . Figure 14 . Pass profile representing acceptance level . Since this practice adds to the team workload , not all areas are likely to go through this process . Some things may not be considered of significant importance and the base scale will be sufficient . Of course , the contextualized scales will be useful beyond the first project , where the definitions can be reused when the next time project is faced with a similar development effort . Here , a structure for storing past definitions and a process for reusing them are needed , to ensure that a “chain of evidence” is kept and that they are verified before reusing them so that errors are not propagated . Knowledge Maturity as Decision Support in Stage - Gate Product Development 53 6 . 3 . 2 Use of knowledge maturity in gated process To illustrate the application of the knowledge maturity scale , the following example adopted from paper E will show how the scale works in a decision of the market assessment earlier described in an offer development process , such as the 7 Day Proposal process . Initially , the team and the management group need to create the contextualised scale from the base scale with the application of expertise regarding cost calculations . The management group completes and approves the scale as having levels that adequately represent the levels of knowledge in the case at hand . Thereafter , acceptance criteria for the next gate is set by the stakeholders and agreed upon by the team . For instance , what is needed in this example to pass the gate is an input of level 4 , a method of level 4 , and an expertise level 3 : see Figure 14 above . Now , the team will start working and performing the work in the stage . The acceptance criteria will serve as a guide for the team in how the work in the stage should be approached , regarding the fidelity of the input , methods and expertise needed for the activity . For instance , the expertise level ( 3 ) in this example means that the team can do without the experts in the company , and still manage a solid level on the decision as long as the input and method remain at an adequate level . As the team prepares for the gate they analyse the work conducted during the stage and compose the results into deliverables . They then analyse the results relative to what is needed , i . e . what numbers the market assessment activity can produce in terms of possible market size . At the same time , they use the knowledge maturity scales to assess how well they can trust the numbers that they have produced . After some discussions within the team , they feel content with the results and prepare for the gate review . Once at the gate review , they will bring their understanding of the level of completeness to the gates . The management group performs the same assessment , and will then discuss the results , mainly focusing on areas they perceive as too weak , where the perception between stakeholders differs , or both . The group will try find ways to advance the project by either clarifying the perception or , if necessary , devising actions and milestones where the project needs to be up to the right standards . Having knowledge as an additional assessment dimension means that they have a more nuanced base to reason with , where adequate results and adequate knowledge level is of course the ultimate situation . If either is too low , the team needs to assess whether improvements are necessary , and thus what kind of improvements are needed and how quickly things need to catch up . Essentially , these types of coordinative artefacts ( Schmidt and Wagner , 2002 ) or boundary objects ( Star and Griesemer , 1989 ) , play the role of highlighting the knowledge base and triggering communication between stakeholders , which is a major benefit with the knowledge maturity scale . Christian Johansson 54 7 DISCUSSION The contribution in relation to other perspectives from the theory is discussed , as well as some complementary aspects based on the findings in this work . 7 . 1 Supporting Decision Making in gates Cooper ( 2001 , 2008 ) advocates the use of kill decisions to focus resources on projects that show more promise of being successful . In this work , this approach is quite rare . There is always an option to terminate a project , but this option is seen as a last resort for the companies , not something to be used with any particular frequency . There is a gap between the company’s working procedure and theory ( Kihlander and Ritzén , 2009 ) . The main reason to avoid terminating projects or even stopping projects at a gate is because product development is contract - driven , i . e . before product development starts in any major format , a contractual agreement is signed between the collaborating partners . With these contractual agreements , penalties will be imposed on the companies if they either choose to terminate the project or if they fall behind their partners . Specifically , the rational decision making that Cooper advocates is not something that is seen to any particular degree in practice , where uncertainty and ambiguity are an occurrence to be dealt with , e . g . by actions for the coming phases . Christiansen and Varnes ( 2006 ) also witnessed this lack of rational decision making in the gates . Further , Simon ( 1955 , 1979 ) , for example , has also questioned the practical application of rational decision making in general given the common occurrence of ambiguity and uncertainty , since it is nearly impossible to know everything about every option introduced to a decision . Therefore , decision situations can be regarded as characterised by bounded rationality and decisions characterised by satisficing ( Simon , 1979 ) . The role of the stage - gate as a boundary object is an interesting finding in this work . Engwall et al . ( 2005 ) also mentioned this , highlighting the stage - gate’s role in facilitating communication and sense - giving for the development team . The findings in this thesis support this view , as well as extend it , arguing that the stage - gate plays an important role in allowing people to challenge other’s perception of the knowledge base . However , the stage - gate allows people to defend their perceptions , thus facilitating knowledge creation through a discussion that can allow people to synthesise their perceptions and advance the knowledge base . This aspect seems to be more dynamic dimension compared to what Engwall introduced . Knowledge Maturity as Decision Support in Stage - Gate Product Development 55 Further , knowledge maturity is introduced as a boundary object in itself , aimed at supporting this boundary negotiating activity , and improve the stage - gate’s role as a boundary negotiating artefact . 7 . 2 Role of Knowledge It is interesting to look at the role of knowledge ( in explicit terms ) in the context of the stage - gate . Although many respondents comment that one of the most important aspects in the stage - gate is knowledge , few attempts actually assess both this factor and the learning about the product that the team is doing during the stages , which is packaged in information carriers and deliverables and brought to the gates . The main interest regards the function and performance that the team expects to be able to draw from the future product , and not focus on assumptions or other sources of ambiguity and uncertainty . In the theory on stage - gate ( Cooper , 2008 , Cooper , 2001 ) , the main focus of the gate reviews is related to the performance of the product and the strength of the business case , which makes this aspect understandable . This also seems to be the case with the tacit dimension of knowledge . From papers A and C , tacit knowledge is an integral part in many decisions , especially during the early phases of a project when few formal and explicit knowledge and information components are available . Gut feeling is important in these early decisions and naturally , the gut feeling of a recognised expert with much experience will implicitly be worth more in the gate decision . Knowing who ( Larsson , 2005 ) has done a certain analysis or prepared a document in the decision base is an important decision input in the gates . On the same line , it is very important to gather the right people when making a decision , so that experienced people have contributed to add validity to the decision , which reduces the risk that a decision will be overturned or that it will not be implemented . This work and the knowledge maturity approach do not attempt to turn tacit knowledge into explicit knowledge or to codify any tacit knowledge . However , the concept of boundary objects and the negotiation of the boundaries , as found in the stage - gate and the knowledge maturity concept , is claimed ( Henderson , 1991 ) to support the articulation of tacit knowledge , and the sharing of tacit knowledge , externalisation and socialisation in the SECI model by Nonaka et al . ( 2000 ) . Further , the boundary object also resembles ‘ba’ , i . e . the context or place where knowledge is created , thus facilitating the SECI model . Using a knowledge maturity approach and focusing on the knowledge , ambiguity and uncertainties can help in sharing tacit knowledge among team members . 7 . 3 Assumptions Management Feedback from industry representatives on this topic points to the importance of dealing with assumptions . Flanagan et al . ( 2007 ) use the term placeholder values to denote the knowledge assets that are temporarily placed in the decision base Christian Johansson 56 and be replaced by more proven knowledge assets . A challenge for decision makers at the gates is to assess assumptions and judge their truthfulness . On a related note is the importance and influence of a gut feeling in the decision base , particularly early on in the process when facts can be scarce . Usually , when facts might be lacking , estimations and assumptions are based on the gut feelings and past experience of experts and other experienced team members . Assumptions management ( Lewis et al . , 2004 ) is a field that has evolved from software development , from where this issue can be very problematic , since the ripple effect throughout the project can be severe and difficult to deal with once they find their way into the software code . Similarly , when making decisions in product development , these issues can greatly influence future decisions , i . e . the decision base can become flawed . The knowledge maturity approach is one way of dealing with this , by highlighting the assumptions in the knowledge base as uncertainties . 7 . 4 A Hidden Criterion : Time Apparent in this work is the constant hidden and implicit acceptance criterion that weighs heavily and can override almost any other acceptance criterion in the gate . This aspect is time . Time lost in rework loops , time falling behind customers’ schedules , etcetera . Christiansen and Varnes ( 2008 ) have also highlighted that time is the most important criterion and more so than any other criterion , because falling behind is not recommended . This also relates to Simon’s ( 1979 ) concept of bounded rationality , which states that decisions are not made when they have reached the optimal state , as advocated by rational decision making , but rather when the decision base has reached an adequate , ‘good enough’ level , i . e . the search for better material is terminated . Of course , as presented in this work , this occasionally does not apply and when projects have to be stopped , e . g . when flight safety and aviation authority regulations influence or coincide with the acceptance criterion at the gates . 7 . 5 The Role in Product - Service Systems In functional products or product - service systems scenario , more aspects will be integrated into the hardware . With a service component , the manufacturer will maintain responsibility of the product throughout its lifetime , selling only the function that it provides . In paper A , a knowledge maturity approach is needed to trace and integrate the diverse sets of decision points to be taken care of at the gates . For instance , the maturity of a hardware component will have an influence on the decision of a relating service component , or an immature hardware component might be pushed back in product development , instead opting for a safer , tested option and then devising an upgrade in the use phase of the PSS . Knowledge Maturity as Decision Support in Stage - Gate Product Development 57 Further , as more and more aspects become integrated and “softer” values take on a larger role compared to the traditional “hard” points , the concept of rational decision making will be even more rare in the future . The lifecycle aspect requires more knowledge about the product’s performance in the downstream phases of its lifecycle to be known upfront , e . g . in the use phase and the recycling phase . However , this knowledge will not be any easier to obtain and decision - makers will therefore be forced to deal with bounded rationality and satisficing even more in the future , since decisions will still need to be made . Here , a knowledge maturity approach will be beneficial because it allows the decision maker to know more about the quality of the decision base , and with this additional knowledge , he or she will have increased confidence in their conditional go decisions . Essentially , they might not be able to make the “optimal” decision , but they will at least know of the limitations of the knowledge base and therefore in the quality of their decision . Further , they will better understand the activities needed to fill the gaps in the knowledge base , and can focus on those most important . Christian Johansson 58 8 CONCLUSION The conclusions chapter begins with a revisit to the aim and purpose from the first chapter , and then elaborates on how the results of the thesis relate to and answers to these aspects . This is followed by remarks regarding the implications that the result of this thesis has on both academia and industry . Finally , some suggestions for interesting areas and avenues to explore in future research are presented at the end of this chapter . 8 . 1 Revisiting the Aim and Purpose The aim with this work was to give decision makers confidence by providing them with a better understanding of the knowledge base that they use in making decisions . The purpose of this work was to investigate and understand the decision making process , and to elaborate on how to support the actual decision making in that process , thus enhancing confidence for decision makers . 8 . 2 Summary of Results To briefly summarise , the results of this thesis are : • The nature of the aerospace business means that the teeth of the gates that Cooper advocates are difficult to find in practice . Although it is still possible to terminate projects , this is a rare option for companies . • Conditional go - decisions and pragmatic decisions are applied in many cases , allowing projects to continue with actions instead of stopping or terminating them • The maturity and quality of knowledge were not acceptance criteria in the practical applications of gate reviews . o The nature of the gate criteria are centred on product performance related aspects . However , the informants see a benefit with having a better focus on knowledge related aspects as well , e . g . with the knowledge maturity concept . • The stage - gate has a boundary negotiating role , resembling a boundary object and supporting communication , collaboration and knowledge sharing in the stage - gate process . • Knowledge maturity was introduced to support decision making in gates , focusing on the knowledge . More specifically , knowledge maturity supports : o Putting knowledge at the centre of attention and allowing decision makers to focus on highlighting and eventually addressing assumptions , ambiguities and uncertainties . Knowledge Maturity as Decision Support in Stage - Gate Product Development 59 o Assessment of the quality of the decision base , thus looking beyond the face value of documents and focusing on performance related aspects at gate reviews . o The ability to focus improvement efforts on areas with low knowledge maturity . o Confidence for decision makers through raised awareness , allowing them to confidently devise actions and make decisions on a ( known ) flawed knowledge base . o Pragmatic decision making where an enhanced awareness of the decision base allows for taking more confident conditional go decisions . • The knowledge maturity tool was developed as a support tool aimed at supporting decision making in gates when dealing with uncertainty and ambiguity in the decision base by comparing current ( as - is ) levels of knowledge maturity with required ( to - be ) levels for go - decisions . 8 . 3 Scientific and Industrial Contribution From an industrial perspective , the main contribution from this work is to provide awareness for decision makers of issues regarding assumptions , ambiguities and uncertainties in the decision base in the stage - gate process , in addition and as a complement to the customary project management functions . Further , the suggestion of a knowledge maturity tool in paper E allows the stakeholders to approach these issues when concerned with making decisions in gates . They now have a concrete way of starting to deal with ambiguity and uncertainty , highlighting the strengths and weaknesses in the knowledge base . Hence , it is possible for stakeholders to deal with the ambiguity and uncertainty , and to devise actions and other mitigation approaches to raise the level of confidence in the knowledge base . Additionally , this approach can support decision makers in making the conditional go decisions found in the descriptive studies in this work . From an academic perspective , the proposition to add knowledge as a dimension to consider in addition to the current considerations in the gates is interesting . This means that the focus of acceptance criteria in the gates are also on the knowledge , ambiguities and uncertainties , in addition to the performance related criteria that Cooper advocates . Further , the connection between both stage - gate and knowledge maturity with the boundary object concept is interesting and would be interesting to understand even better , especially if focusing on the dynamic nature that the boundary negotiating perspective of the stage - gate highlights . 8 . 4 Suggestions for Future Research Paper E presents the knowledge maturity tool related to the prescriptive study phase in the Design Research Methodology ( DRM ) ( Blessing and Chakrabarti , 2002 ) ( see Figure 2 on page 10 of this thesis ) , whereas papers A through D are related to the earlier phases of research clarification and descriptive study I . The Christian Johansson 60 next step is to complete a full loop of the DRM methodology and conduct descriptive study II , i . e . the approach should be tested and evaluated . This is planned for future work , by doing it in a stepwise fashion where the fidelity of the test is gradually increased . Initially , easier and quicker thought experiments will be done with different experts , to verify that the concept corresponds to the intended applications and to prepare for a more large - scale test . When the concept is suitable for a live test at the case company , where the bulk of the data was collected . When analysing the tests , any opportunities for further improvements will be considered and integrated into the knowledge maturity approach . These results are mainly applicable to the aerospace context , as was highlighted in the delimitations . However , taking these ideas and issues and testing them in other contexts ( i . e . consumer products , etc . ) that has development that is not driven by contracts is of interest . Investigating the applicability of knowledge maturity ideas in these kinds of contexts would be an interesting future work activity . Further , the applicability of knowledge maturity ideas to support the sharing of immature knowledge is also something that is interesting to investigate further , allowing designers to ‘tag’ their knowledge with the level of maturity to prepare the receiving designer for how he or she could make use of it . This could potentially allow people to make use of each other’s knowledge assets earlier in the process , and allow them to build on each other’s developments to a greater degree .

(cid:2) (cid:2)(cid:2) On the way to knowledge awareness in early design Å Ericson , M Bergström , C Johansson , T Larsson Division of Computer Aided Design , Luleå University of Technology , Sweden Abstract This paper discusses views on decision support in product development to identify factors of relevance when designing computer - based decision sup - port for total offers . Providing services in form of physical artefacts of - fered as ‘functions per unit’ is at the heart of total offers . Total offers gain access to possibilities to ‘design in’ value added characteristics into the physical artefact , e . g . , maintenance , monitoring , training , remanufacture . Contemporary computer tools seem to be insufficient to support a GO / NO GO decision for total offers . Relevant factors to take into consideration are to support learning and provide the decision makers with insights in a number of plausible ‘what - if’ scenarios to improve the solution space . Keywords Product development , decision - making process , decision support , collabo - rative engineering Introduction Globalization , increased competition , dynamic and constantly changing business demands are no exception for manufacturing companies in the Swedish industry . In this scenery , the companies have to manage aspects that could be considered as not compatible . For example , customers’ want individualized products at the same time as industry has to strive for stan - dardization , since cost and time savings are paramount to be viable . The competition is not only about providing high - quality artefacts , but also to provide added value , i . e . , a shift towards providing services . The vision to differentiate physical products by supplying them as ser - vices are captured within the idea to provide customers with total offers [ 1 ] . The physical artefact , services related to that artefact and company specific knowledge are thought of as elements in the total offer . The total offer is in itself a service , since what is provided is offered as ‘functions per unit’ . Inherent in a total offer is the intention to provide customers with functions in time and place ‘as - needed’ in a long term commitment . The sale of functions also gain access to possibilities to upgrade and remanu - facture the physical product , as well as provide for ‘embedded’ mainte - nance . However , services are developed differently than physical artefacts . One difference is , “Whereas goods are manufactured , services are performed” [ 2 ] ( p . 65 ) . The customer is present and contributes to the service develop - ment process . From a service perspective , the physical artefact is “…just one element in the total , ongoing service offering . For a manufacturer , the physical good is a core element of the service offering , of course , because it is a prerequisite for a successful offering” [ 3 ] ( p . 9 ) . Archetypically , the view on products as physical things is embodied in a product development perspective [ e . g . , 4 - 6 ] . Yet , the intentions to provide a total offer affects this view by increased intangibility , for example , in terms of the final result , i . e . , functions meeting the customers needs , and in terms of the development process , i . e . , to design those functions into physical artefacts . The total offer calls for integrating a diversity of knowl - edge areas , e . g . , business , design and manufacturing , accordingly affecting the product development process in the same way . Besides insisting on co - ordination and communication in a cross - boundary setting , making the right decisions at the right time is vital in this setting . Contemporary prod - uct development is extensively computer aided and the use of Computer Aided Engineering ( CAE ) tools is established in the industrial context . For example , finite element analysis techniques , as well as knowledge - based systems are used in design activities and , by tradition , bound to geometry modelling . Current tools , focused on hardware parameters , seem to be in - sufficient to support GO / NO GO decisions for total offers , since they do not provide an overview of a wider set of parameters . It is not apparent which aspects a tool to aid decisions in early design phases of physical ar - tefacts sold in total offers needs to support . Thus , the purpose in this paper is to describe views on decisions in product development to identify relevant factors to consider when design - ing computer - based decision support for total offers . Data generation In general , data for the study presented in this paper has been generated during informal and formal meetings with companies affiliated to a re - search centre . Data for a functional product development process and a collaborative engineering model have evolved during these meetings . Spe - cifically , data has been generated in a series of workshops , whereas two are in focus for this paper . The participating companies are found within manufacturing industry . There were 15 participants ( 10 from industry and 5 from academia ) in one of the two workshops . 5 companies were repre - sented in that workshop . The intention to focus on computer - based support for total offers evolved during this workshop , as well as the purpose for this study . Notes have been taken during the workshop . In addition , the second workshop was performed as a ‘future workshop’ [ 7 ] , at one of the affiliated companies . The workshop consisted of 8 par - ticipants from industry and 4 from academia . The group in a future work - shop should include people who will get in direct contact with the tool that is going to be developed . Accordingly , the industry was represented by people from service , business , design and manufacturing departments . The academia was represented by people with different research interests . This made it possible to generate rich data . This workshop has been tape re - corded . A future workshop runs in three phases , critique , fantasy and im - plementation phase . All were performed during the workshop . The critique phase highlights specific problems about the practice ‘as - is’ , and is in fo - cus for this paper . Approaches to decision - making Three approaches to decision - making are put forward by Mintzberg and Westley [ 8 ] . Firstly , the ‘thinking first’ supports planning and works best in , e . g . , an established production process , since it is characterised by : a clear issue , reliable data , a structured context , thoughts that can be pinned down and control can be applied . This describes a rational decision - making process , where the steps are ; ( 1 ) define the problem , ( 2 ) diagnose its causes , ( 3 ) design possible solutions , and ( 4 ) decide which is best and implement the choice . Despite being a frequent description , this is an un - common approach and insufficient to explain decision - making [ 8 ] . Secondly , the ‘seeing first’ supports visioning and works best in , e . g . , new product development , when : the combinations of many elements into creative solutions are needed , a key to those solutions is commitment and cross - boundary communication is vital . This approach suggests that ac - tions might be driven as much by insights ( seeing into ) as by what is thought . Experiences and knowledge developed over years is a vital start - ing position . The seeing first is a base for the following incubation time , “…during which the unconscious mind mulls over the issue . [ Then ] … there is that flash of illumination” [ 8 ] ( p . 90 ) . This ‘eureka moment’ often comes when the rational thinking is turned off , e . g . in sleep . So , the actual deci - sion of the choice to go for is more erupting than emerging . However , the verification , e . g . , reasoning it all out for elaboration and proof and / or to write it down , takes time [ 8 ] . Thirdly , the ‘doing first’ supports learning and works best when , e . g . , companies face disruptive technology . This situation is : novel and confus - ing , hampered by complicated specification and moved forward by a few simple relationship rules . When it is not possible to see it or think it up , a doing approach is supportive and encourages learning by doing [ 8 ] . A traditional approach to decision - making leads actors to view the situa - tion in a binary way , assuming that the world is either certain or uncertain [ 9 ] . The former view makes the actors believe that the future situation is possible to predict precisely , and the latter view makes them consider the future as completely unpredictable . Actors that experiences very uncertain environments might not trust their gut - feelings and thus , suffer from deci - sion paralysis . They focus on reengineering , quality management or inter - nal cost - reduction programs instead [ 9 ] . To make sound strategic decisions when facing uncertainty , a binary view has to be avoided . The identifica - tion of a range of potential outcomes or even a discrete set of scenarios is a simple insight that is extremely powerful to determine which strategy is best [ 9 ] . A decisions - making process is intertwined in human analysis processes , thus a work - oriented approach to computational support seems promising [ 10 ] . Total Offer Readiness Level – the idea “ We have something to take into account which we cannot really do to - day” and an increased intangibility in design decisions were emphasised in the workshops . The discussions rendered up in a need for understanding the maturity level on knowledge to provide total offers . Computational support was recognized as important to engineering activities and an inter - est for a computer tool to visualise knowledge maturity level emerged . The base for decisions was recognized to support GO / NO GO decisions for to - tal offers . The idea for a computer tool , to give insights in the maturity level of knowledge in the company as a whole and to give overview to the possi - bilities to provide total offers , was named Total Offer Readiness Level ( TORL ) . The discussion was inspired by the technology readiness level used by NASA [ 11 ] . The technology readiness level is visualised by a ‘thermometer’ showing 9 readiness levels , where level 9 correspond to ‘flight proven’ system , see Figure 1 . The overview given by the ‘ther - mometer’ was particularly appealing . Though , it was also recognised , by the participants in the workshop , that a total offer aim to encompass more than technical aspects and this is complicating product development , as well as the base for decisions . Figure 1 : NASA Technology Readiness Level [ 11 ] . Problems in decision - making process – as - is The informants talked about gathering people with relevant competences and people possessing the ability to influence the decision at higher organ - isational levels as critical to the decision - making process . It was empha - sised that including high level persons in the meetings was necessary to give the decision - making process validity and stability over time . The in - formants could not describe how they know who had relevant compe - tences , but they mentioned time as a constraint to gather the right people . “A meeting the same day would not be possible since there would proba - bly be a drop off of 90 % ” , they said . Two weeks notice was perceived as a necessary time limit to gather most of the relevant people . Collecting facts from existing computer support were mentioned as easy to access . Existing support were , for example , management tools for pro - ject costs and time or process management tools . Tools for process man - agement were described as relating to roles and not to positions in the or - ganisation . “How do I know who to talk with when problem occurs in the process ? ” , said one respondent . The possibilities to predict costs for manufacturing over a longer time span was mentioned as causing prob - lems . Many decisions were based on the fact of being an experienced team member , i . e . , the task has been done in previous projects . However , the computer support for historical events was found sparse . Despite access to and possibilities to collect facts , the analysing activities were perceived as time consuming . The informants emphasised gut - feeling as important , and as a base for many decisions . The design process was explained as a continuous dialog with customers about boundaries and possibilities for the physical artefact . The dialogue starts with some kind of document , for example a mechanical drawing or even a very simple form of drawing . From this starting position , the proc - ess was described as a long chain of analyses to perform . The procedure to acquire offers from subcontractors in the design phase was found particu - larly time consuming . One informant said “Here we work very tradition - ally . To make an inquiry , via our purchase department , we have to have a drawing of some kind . The problem is that documents like that do not exist at this point . Purchase staff has to make guesses sometimes , or describe , as best they can , what they want . ” He continued , “And , you know , how you put forward your questions affect the answers” , and emphasised that the level of details is important . Being focused on an overarching level , small details , e . g . , a bolt , can be forgotten , even though utterly important . The informants started to talk about decisions in the design phase , but realised that “some homework had to be done before” . This call attention to that “the right decisions are made long before” the design phase in product development starts . Identifying relevant factors The provision of total offers and the step towards designing physical arte - facts to provide ‘functions per unit’ is likely to affect product develop - ment . These changes are in this context captured and addressed in a Func - tional Product Development ( FPD ) process . There are elements building up a total offer , e . g . , training , maintenance and services , which by some of its characteristics could be perceived as based on experiences , i . e . , tacit knowledge . These elements can be handled as separate in product devel - opment , for example in aftermarket activities , however in FPD these as - pects are thought of as having a holistic effect on the design of the product in early phases . The design phases in FPD may need an extended design space to take , for example , life - cycle issues , into account . Early on it is needed to pro - vide a number of business scenarios to be considered , e . g . , to develop a physical artefact for transaction , or to develop a physical artefact for a total offer , or to adapt existing artefacts for a long term provision . Hence , it seems like FPD needs to handle ambiguity differently than traditional product development , e . g . , to widen the design space and assimilate ill - structured goals into the design process . Activities in such a design process can be described as “…creating visions and new ideas , formulating speci - fications on the basis of a range of competence , and mutual learning and understanding” [ 12 ] ( p . 289 ) . Viewing product development as occurring on a line of sequences , downstream activities , e . g . , product use , monitoring , maintenance and re - cycling , are needed to be understood as early as possible to influence de - sign decisions . However , in this study it is identified that a design process seems to start earlier than what is thought of . At this stage information about the project are sparse , even tough resolutions has to be made . Ini - tially , gathering people with relevant competences is necessary . The identi - fication of these people is essential to give the decisions validity and sta - bility over time . Furthermore , to enable integration and movement of downstream experiences into early phases , multifunctional design teams seem necessary . In this pre - design decision phase , it seems like computer - based tools needs to support identification of relevant resources and give an overview of when and how they can be used for the upcoming project . A supportive tool might also highlight what resources are lacking , as well as provide aid to identify key people in the organisation when problem oc - curs in the process . A tool for an overview of the maturity knowledge level should facilitate documentation of these problems to enable new knowl - edge to emerge based on these experiences . The novel issues to take into account can be derived from the shift in view and / or from the need to integrate business , design and manufacturing knowledge areas . This integration is fundamental , yet not trivial . The re - spondents in this study has emphasised that gut - feeling serves as a base for many decisions . In our interpretation this is particularly happening in a pre - design phase when ambiguity about the contents in the project as such is prevalent . So , firstly , the nature of knowledge to integrate from some ar - eas can be understood as tacit , thus not easily identified , captured , justified and formalised into computer applications . Knowledge can also be thought of as in constant change and evolving over time . The task to keep the data - base up to date might be overwhelming . As a result , there might become a gap between the knowledge maturity level held by people and the knowl - edge maturity level shown by the computer - based support tool . Thus , a situation where people do not trust the result given by the tool can occur . In light of this , learning capabilities could be a relevant factor to the design of the decision tool . Secondly , people from divergent disciplines have different preferences for how to interact with a computer - based decision tool . This affects the visualisation of the result and the interface . The type of decision tool dis - cussed here is aiming to give an overview of the company’s knowledge maturity level . This understanding has to be provided on the right level and in the way that is comprehensible for those working and making decisions on that level . For instance , people from manufacturing functions are more interested in technical details than sales people . Salesmen would like to combine elements into an offer and be able to communicate with custom - ers . In turn , early input from this customer communication is crucial to de - signers , especially if the offer include new product development . Besides being easy to use and provide for substantial improvements in the design process , the decisions support tool should increase the confidence for those who are using it . Figure 2 : Readiness Level views Figure 2 is representing the idea , not an application view . The keyholes at the bottom of figure 2 symbolise a ‘right’ level view . Through these windows a set of related knowledge maturity level visualisations appear . These are in the figure presented as thermometers each showing nine readiness levels ( RL 1 - 9 ) ; however in reality the visualisation might differ on different levels and from different views . It is important that the pa - rameters represented are separate , not integrated into one and the same ‘thermometer’ , since it is the relations between these that are of interest and provide an overview . For example , in figure 2 , in the middle , the sales - man can see that the business readiness level is high . This indicates , e . g . , that agreement for total offers with customers is under discussion , the company strategy and vision are in line with total offer businesses and cus - tomer needs and / or requirements are identified . From this view , it can also be seen that the readiness level for manufacturing is very low . This indi - cates , e . g . , that the company might not have appropriate production equipment , that manufacturing procedures does not exist and has to be de - veloped . And , it can also be seen , that the design readiness level has not yet reached a predefined level . The decision to go for a total offer in this case is not recommendable , since it will not be possible to provide the functions needed by the customer . However , based on this overview , re - sources to increase the readiness level for design and manufacturing can be put in . The shift towards service provision could be interpreted as new product development , i . e . , the product offered to customers has changed by its na - ture from primarily a tangible artefact to an intangible service . A ‘seeing first’ approach [ 8 ] enables new ways of thinking and could be aided by a computer - based decision tool which allows visualisation of a number of ‘what - if’ scenarios and / or a range of potential outcomes . In this way a bi - nary view on the situation as either certain or uncertain [ 9 ] can be avoided . A decision tool which provide simulation opportunities support a virtual ‘doing first’ approach [ 8 ] , and in turn also provide learning possibilities without causing costly prototyping etc . The use of computer tools can pro - vide swift access to information , yet the analysis of the result is human based . Conclusion The aim in this paper was to discuss views on decisions in product devel - opment to identify relevant factors to consider when designing computer - based decision support for total offers . The incitement for the study stem from a need identified in manufacturing industry to understand the knowl - edge maturity level in the company to be able to provide total offers to customers . Additional knowledge aspects to take into account in total offers can be understood as tacit , i . e . , based on experiences and interpretations . This kind of knowledge is difficult to translate into computer applications , yet it is identified as a relevant factor . Another relevant factor that has been identified is the importance to provide insights in the relations between each parameter , thus integration of parameters into one readiness level should be avoided . Decisions for novel and unfamiliar situations could be supported by visualisation and simulation of plausible outcomes and a ‘learning by doing’ approach . So , to support a GO / NO GO decision for to - tal offers a computer - based decision tool seems to insist on taking learning capabilities as another relevant factor . In this paper an engineering perspective has been prevalent . We have not considered a business perspective on computer tools to support total offers , still this is of most concern to improve decisions . Studies to further improve the understanding of parameters crucial to total offer readiness level is an ongoing work . For example , a demonstrator capturing some main ideas will be presented and evaluated in a workshop . References 1 . Alonso - Rasgado , T . , Thompson , G . , Elfström , B - O . ( 2004 ) .

This requires the way a proposal is developed to change substantially and knowledge support is important here . Knowledge Maturity is about improving the use of knowledge by comparing existing knowledge with needed knowledge . Using a criterion scale , knowledge maturity is assessed to improve confidence in decisions . Gated Maturity Assessment is an example where stage - gate decisions are supported with maturity capabilities . Teams can reason about knowledge at gate reviews similarly as with results . Keywords : Maturity , Knowledge Enabled Engineering , Decision Support 1 INTRODUCTION Lead - time reduction is constantly in focus for many organisations in the manufacturing industry . Reducing lead - time means that products reach markets quicker and the companies can capitalise on opportunities in the markets , earning money , instead of spending , as is the case in the development phase of a product’s life cycle . What is important to remember is that this cannot happen at the expense of quality or total cost . Aeronautics is by no means different in comparison to any other sector on this point . Companies need to constantly reduce their development cycles [ 1 ] , where the same amount of decisions needs to be taken in a shorter time frame , while maintaining the quality of the process . As a consequence – the importance of decision - making in a rational manner increases . Understanding the decision base , and predicting the consequences of decisions must be done in a quite limited time frame . Before moving on to the core topic of this paper , a brief description of the conditions in the aeronautical industry will highlight the context . What makes an already competitive situation even more challenging is the fact that the aeronautical business environment is in rapid transition . Contracts between customers ( i . e . airlines ) and manufacturers are showing an increasing bias towards service provision and total offers . The product detailed in such contracts can be referred to as a Functional Product [ 2 ] . A functional product can be summarised as the provision of a service , including hardware ( i . e . aero engines ) where a function responsibility is targeted . One example is Rolls Royce that together with its partners ( e . g . Volvo Aero ) provides ‘Power - by - the - Hour’ offers to their customer . In such an arrangement , the manufacturers remain owners of the aero engine and the airline operator merely pays for the function utilised , i . e . the customers only pay for the function when they use it . With this arrangement , the risk associated with managing the product’s function provision , throughout its life cycle , remains with the manufacturer , as opposed to the risk mainly staying with the customer in a traditional ‘time and materials’ arrangement , where the customer buys the product and continues to pay for servicing as the need arises along the product life cycle . Due to the relatively high cost of products in the aeronautics industry , buying a fleet of aircraft is an expensive proposition for most airline operators . Therefore , manufacturers usually subsidise the initial price , by as much as 70 % [ 3 ] , and then bring home the profits on the aftermarket activities by charging for servicing to make the product profitable over the product’s life cycle . With this arrangement , spending is quite unpredictable for the customers as maintenance activities can be hard to plan for over a fleet of aircraft , hence , the interest in functional products . Given the risks and the rather substantial investments needed to develop the products , the manufacturers most often team up in partnerships to share cost and risk – and thus also revenue and profit . These ‘risk and revenue sharing partnerships’ are also formed on the basis of companies wanting to better utilise their knowledge assets and focus on their core competencies . Therefore , companies begin to team up in ‘virtual enterprises’ [ 4 ] to be able to better perform the projects , by utilising the partner companies’ core competencies in an effective manner . A virtual enterprise is a loosely coupled network of partner organisations that form on the basis of a market opportunity that they will be able to produce together in a superior manner . The partners in the virtual enterprise are equal in the sense that they are collectively responsible for integration , and that they have equal stakes and say in the partnership . After project completion , the virtual enterprise usually disbands and the companies leave the partnership . CIRP Design Conference 2008 This paper explores the use of knowledge maturity – a concept to assess the maturity of the decision base ( i . e . the quality of the knowledge used to make a decision ) – to enable a proposal development team to reduce the lead - time of the proposal development process of an aeronautics product , to be developed in a virtual enterprise . The paper describes the Gated Maturity Assessment approach that uses maturity scales to assess the quality of the knowledge in decision documents in the development process of an offering of a functional product by a virtual enterprise . 2 THE VIVACE PROJECT The work presented in this paper was conducted within the frame of the European project VIVACE ( Value Improvement through a Virtual Aeronautical Collaborative Enterprise ) [ 5 ] . The VIVACE project is a (cid:1) 70M EC - funded integrated project and features participation from most parts of Europe’s aeronautics industry , including Airbus , Rolls - Royce , Volvo Aero Corporation , BAE Systems , EADS , Avio , etc . VIVACE has its roots in ACARE ( Advisory Council for Aeronautics Research in Europe ) [ 6 ] , a group representing the European aeronautics industry’s research interests , that has devised a strategy for the development of air travel and of the aerospace industry in Europe for the year 2020 , i . e . what scenarios are feasible and what changes and improvements are needed to respond to theses scenarios . Parts of these goals include the high level objectives of the VIVACE project . These are to achieve a 5 % cost reduction in aircraft development and contributions towards a 50 % cost reduction and a 30 % lead - time reduction in engine development . This will be achieved through supporting the design of a complete aircraft , including its engines , with the development of a virtual product in a virtual enterprise , which implies a substantial reliance on improved simulation capabilities as well as new ways of collaborating . To support this , a number of ‘Advanced Capabilities’ , of which Knowledge Enabled Engineering ( KEE ) [ 7 ] is one , has been developed . KEE is the use of Knowledge Management ( KM ) within an engineering context to support a real business scenario ( i . e . a Use Case ) . This paper describes the development of one such KEE capability , the Gated Maturity Assessment , used in the 7 Day Proposal ( 7DP ) use case of the VIVACE project . The 7DP use case was created as a challenging scenario where an offer is generated following a gated process in a quite accelerated manner . 3 DATA COLLECTION As described above , the work has been developed around the 7DP use case . Therefore , following the work structure in the project , the business experts , stating the needs of the use case , have been involved during the development of the solutions presented in this paper . Data has been collected ; both by having workshops with representatives from business development at Volvo Aero and through project meetings and telephone conferences where representatives of the 7DP use case have provided feedback relating to the solutions developed . Essentially , the data collection has been performed using participative methods , where qualitative feedback and suggestions have been provided throughout the development process . 4 7 DAY PROPOSAL As mentioned in the introduction of this paper , lead - time reduction is a prioritised area in virtually any industrial sector . The 7 Day Proposal ( 7DP ) use case is an envisioned , future business scenario , where the lead - time for the offer development phase of a business deal , pertaining to an aeronautical product ( i . e . an airplane or an aero engine ) is substantially reduced . Today , the normal time to get from a ‘Request for Proposal’ ( RFP ) to a delivery of the proposal to the customer is from two weeks up to six weeks in the cases where it is a fairly straightforward proposal with low ambiguity that will be developed . In the cases where extensive development work is needed and where the ambiguity is higher , the time can be substantially longer , in some cases over a year . In the 7DP vision , a virtual enterprise consortium , consisting of a number of aeronautics companies working together , develops an offer for a comprehensive aerospace product in seven days while maintaining appropriate quality . Hence , reducing the lead - time to seven days requires activities to be performed differently , compared to today . It is not enough to merely ‘speed up’ the current process , but there is a need for new ways of working and performing tasks , such as making greater use of modelling and simulation capabilities at this very early stage in the product’s life cycle . There is also a need for structuring the work performed , especially when there are several companies involved , as the risk is otherwise that different companies have different ways of calculating and developing results , which is hard to integrate into one solution in the end . Using a structured development process with clearly defined decision points is one way of catering for this need . In the 7DP , a stage - gate process of similar structure ( but not contents ) to Cooper’s Stage - Gate process [ 8 ] , with stages and gates for decision points is used . In each stage of the process , there are parallel sub - processes with activities performed concurrently to further contribute to the lead - time reduction needed . The decision points provide timely opportunities to catch up with any weak points as quickly as possible , to be able to devise actions to bring the proposal up to a sufficient level . In some cases , rework is needed , and the decision points enable decision makers to decide on this as quickly as possible . Coupled with this , there is a ‘support system’ , which is a specification of the type of model - , tool - , IT - support needed to use the process and deliver the proposal on time . While working with the 7DP Process , there are pointers to different support tools that are needed to complete the activities as intended . Further , the team producing the proposal needs to make use of downstream knowledge , i . e . to bring in knowledge related to the later phases of a product’s life cycle . Knowing more in the early stages promises to reduce the amount of rework that would otherwise be needed further down the line . In the case of an offer development process , knowing a lot early on will enable decisions to be made on a better basis and will contribute to a reduced risk of problems occurring down the line of the product’s life cycle . Figure 1 : Technology Readiness Level ( TRL ) from NASA [ 9 ] . 5 MATURITY There are several concepts surrounding maturity to be found in literature . This section reports on a few of them that were used as stepping - stones for the results presented in this paper . Technology Readiness Levels ( TRL ) [ 10 ] is an approach developed by NASA during the mid 1990’s to assess maturity of technologies ( i . e . components , systems , etc ) to assess its flight readiness status . It is today a standard way of assessing technology maturity in many parts of the aeronautics sector . TRL is used both by manufacturers and government agencies ( i . e . US Department of Defense ) making technology acquisitions , where manufacturers need to demonstrate a certain readiness , or proven capability , in their technologies and systems to be awarded contracts . TRL features a nine level scale ( illustrated on a thermometer as in Figure 1 ) to assess where the particular technology is positioned on the scale from basic research to ‘flight proven’ status . The scale features criterion definitions based on ‘generic’ sentences to help decision makers and design teams to define where on the scale they are . An important ingredient is the fact that the technology needs to be proven worthy of a level through tests in different environments , such as a laboratory environment for the immature technologies and ( in the case of NASA ) a space environment for a very mature technology . Finally , it should be noted that not all components and systems go through all levels of the TRL scale . As the cost of proving the readiness of the technologies can be quite high , only “mission critical” systems go to level 9 , whereas less important components , not in connection with any critical systems , might only be taken to level 6 before being regarded as mature enough . The Capability Maturity Model ( CMM ) [ 11 ] is a concept in software development where it is used to assess the capability of software development in a company , i . e . how mature the company’s software development process is . The Software Engineering Institute ( SEI ) at Carnegie Mellon University developed the CMM , and is also responsible for the successor model called Capability Maturity Model Integration ( CMMI ) [ 12 ] that have taken the ideas of CMM further . In a similar way to TRL , CMM is used by government agencies such as the US Department of Defense to assess software contractors and determine whether or not they can deliver software systems on time , on budget and to sufficient quality . Proving a high enough level on this scale is an insurance of sorts that the company is reliable in delivering , which lowers the overall risk for the customer . Climbing the CMM scale is not something that is done quickly by targeting the top level directly . In this case , the team will incrementally move through the scale , proving their worthiness of the particular level by mastering a number of key process areas that are defined within each level . Figure 2 below depicts the CMM scale , with the ‘stairs’ illustrating that the team needs to climb them to reach the highest level . Figure 2 : Capability Maturity Model ( CMM ) adopted from Paulk et al [ 11 ] . Even though the TRL and CMM models are the most widely accepted frameworks applied in industrial sectors , there are other concepts that have brought forward some interesting ideas in this area . Knowledge Management Maturity Model ( KMMM ) is a term that has been used on numerous occasions . The General KMMM framework described by Pee et al ( 2006 ) [ 13 ] is an attempt to summarise most of these attempts and produce a concept that unifies most of these ideas . The KMMM concept is basically about assessing an organisation’s capabilities pertaining to knowledge management , in a similar way to the CMM assessing software development . It is about assessing the organisation’s processes for knowledge management and how different support systems – such as expert systems and repositories – are implemented and used . The perception of this model is that the focus is , as with knowledge management , on an organisational level – meaning that the assessment is on how the organisation can best manage their knowledge assets . Research & Development Degree of Difficulty ( R & D 3 ) [ 14 ] is a concept , brought forward by NASA that is related to TRL in the sense that it describes the effort needed to reach a certain level on the TRL scale . In some cases , the technology may only be a derivate from another component or system , i . e . an interpolation , where the difficulty is relatively low , as similar efforts have already been undertaken . On the other hand , in some other cases , the effort may be quite substantial with fundamental research projects and breakthroughs needed to achieve the particular TRL for the component . Knowledge Readiness Level [ 15 ] is an idea that is also brought forward by NASA . In this case , it is about assessing the amount of knowledge that is available and accessible to the team . At one extreme of the scale , it is about getting the right people together , whereas at the other end this is not enough . Here , a fundamental research program is needed to fill the void . Chiaramonte and Joshi ( 2004 ) [ 15 ] write , “ …the cost of the “answer” is related to the KRL . Low KRL’s are relatively inexpensive , while high KRL’s require substantial research funding ” ( p . 36 ) [ 15 ] . 6 KNOWLEDGE MATURITY As described in the section about the 7DP , making use of knowledge from downstream phases is essential to reduce lead - time without losing quality in the 7DP process . Today , in offer processes , a lot of time is lost because the wrong or not enough information and knowledge is available at gate reviews when decisions are due , resulting in rework . The main idea behind the concept in this paper is to support the utilisation of this knowledge by assessing the maturity of the knowledge that is utilised ( i . e . shared , created , used etc . ) in the proposal versus the knowledge defined to be necessary from the beginning . Knowledge maturity is about knowing what is known . As the famous HP quote ”If only HP knew what HP knows…” ( p . 47 ) [ 16 ] says , it is about giving the design team a means to assess what they , or the company , might already know about a certain activity or artefact . Hence , knowledge maturity is about providing design teams with insights about which areas they have sufficient knowledge and information in , and it is also about highlighting the areas where more knowledge is needed . Therefore , the team can take action to correct any area where knowledge might be too poor for providing a base for a confident decision . Being confident in the fact that the decisions are made from a solid knowledge base is what the concept of knowledge maturity attempts to reach ; i . e . assuring confidence for decision makers and design teams . It is about putting the knowledge at the centre of attention , and examining what the team knows about a certain result , instead of just looking at the facts and figures . What is essentially an assumption can be mistaken for being much more truthful than is actually the case , just because team members do not back up the results on the basis of the knowledge behind the numbers . As this work is centred on the 7DP process , the knowledge maturity concept needs to support decision - making in stage - gate processes . O’Donnell and Duffy ( 2005 ) [ 17 ] writes about a feedback loop used in assessing and analysing design performance . In this work the assessment loop ( see Figure 3 below ) is quite similar , with the main difference being that it is not the design performance being considered , but rather the knowledge that builds up the performance . Performing work in a business process ( i . e . 7DP process ) the team use criteria to assess the knowledge in the process . Thereafter , especially when too little knowledge is available , the team needs to analyse why that is the case and how they can best manage this . Thereafter they decide on actions ( i . e . rework or tweaks to the coming stages ) at the gate . Figure 3 : Assessment loop . 7 GATED MATURITY ASSESSMENT The Gated Maturity Assessment ( GMA ) is an example to demonstrate and test a possible implementation of the thoughts and ideas behind the knowledge maturity concept , and how this can support a situation in a proposal development process in industry . The GMA technique has been developed to support the 7DP process that was described earlier in this paper . The idea is to support decisions in a stag - gate process by providing an instrument to assess and evaluate the level of knowledge that builds up the material ( i . e . content and rationale ) that is used to support the decisions . The GMA relies on three components to decide the knowledge level in a decision base , namely : • Quality of input data , • Quality of the method ( and / or tool ) used to produce the contents , and finally • The experience and expertise of the people that has produced the proposal . To describe these in a bit more detail , input data is about the information that comes into the team , from external sources such as suppliers , customers or other departments . Method represents the way a task has been carried out , with what tool and to what accuracy the method permits the task to be done , i . e . a FEM ( Finite Element Method ) analysis can be performed with different meshes and fidelity depending on the amount of calculations that are feasible . Experience and expertise deals with the people doing the work . Sometimes access to the most knowledgeable experts is not possible , or perhaps sometimes the key person might just be ill at the wrong time . Also , sometimes ‘gut feeling’ is all that is available , for instance , at an early stage of the process . This factor reflects the quality and confidence of the end results and thus the material put up for a decision . To be able to assess the maturity of each part in the decision base , a set of criteria ( i . e . metrics ) is used to assess the outcome of the process activities . The initial development of the GMA criterion scale has borrowed ideas and taken inspiration from many of the concepts of maturity described earlier in this paper . Essentially the GMA concept is built up from a criterion scale in a similar way such as the Technology Readiness Levels are built up from . As the decision base is in many cases a document , which can be seen as an artefact , TRL is used as inspiration for the GMA concept . The fact that the contents of a decision base is also a result of a development process , and thus is reflected by that process , the CMM concept is also of interest . Table 1 below , depicts the initial development of the GMA scale with keywords representing the end levels and middle level . At this early stage , levels 2 and 4 have been omitted and are used as intermediate levels between the others as ‘step on the way’ levels . 5 Excellent : Proving , optimising , known confidence 4 Good : 3 Acceptable : Standardised , defined , stable , repeatable , controllable 2 Dubious : 1 Inferior : Ad - hoc , heroic efforts , unstable , person - dependant , no focus , no formal support / methods Table 1 : Initial criterion scale . Assessing maturity using the GMA technique is essentially about comparing the ‘as - is’ level with a predefined ‘pass profile’ ( i . e . ‘to - be’ ) on the components that are being assessed . This pass profile is decided in advance to be the required level of the particular case . Figure 4 depicts a tentative pass profile where components B and D would require substantial improvements to reach a confident level , while A and C are ‘nearly there’ . Figure 4 : Tentative ‘pass profile’ with four components . 7 . 1 Support Tool Complementary to the concept and the criterion scale , a support tool developed in Microsoft Excel is intended to support the assessment of maturity in the stage - gate process . When working in the proposal process , workers can input progress made and in a similar manner see progress made by others . This provides a ‘helicopter perspective’ on the project that enables action to be taken on issues with too low knowledge maturity . Figure 5 shows a screenshot of the support tool . 2 TITLE Responsible 1 ( 2 ) 3 ( 4 ) 5 Sum Maturity Sum Maturity Method y y y y 0 4 Input y y y y y 5 Exp . y y y y y 5 Method y y n 0 0 2 Input y y y y 0 4 Exp . y y n n 0 2 Method y n n 0 0 1 Input y y n n 0 2 Exp . y n n n n 1 Method y y y 0 0 3 Input y y n n 0 2 Exp . y y y n n 3 Method y n n 0 0 1 Input y n n n 0 1 Exp . y y y n n 3 Method y n n 0 0 1 Input n n n n 0 0 Exp . y y y n n 3 GATE LEVEL : Market Need Assessment 2 1 Cost Calculation TOTAL : 2 Generic # 2 2 Generic # 1 2 Generic # 3 2 Generic # 4 2 Figure 5 : Screenshot of support tool . 8 CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION The objective of this paper was to explore the use of knowledge maturity to contribute to lead time reduction by assessing content and rationale in decision material ( explicit and implicit ) . The GMA technique is a concept for assessing the maturity of information and knowledge in decision material by using a criterion scale to assess the contents and rationale with . Using the GMA , the teams have an instrument to reason about knowledge as a core result in a similar manner as performance is presently assessed and analysed . The team members can start discuss knowledge – or in the worst case , lack of knowledge – in a similar way as they discuss thrust , weight and fuel burn . The usage of ‘pass profiles’ provides an interesting aspect to this concept , as they enable comparison of pass profiles for different offers with a view of ‘carrying over’ knowledge from a previous project to the current one , to make better use of previous knowledge . The knowledge maturity concept shows promise of actually supporting how a team deals with assumptions . Especially early in a process , assumptions are quite frequent . The problem is that people can tend to believe in the interest of self - preservation that it is bad behaviour to visualise uncertainty in the knowledge base ( e . g . a little better would always have been possible and desirable ) . On the contrary , what is needed just this kind of uncertainty to be visible and this visibility is needed as early as possible in the process . For instance , knowing that a value of a parameter is somewhere between 10 and 14 ( depending on other factors ) , and hence , not exactly 13 makes a huge difference to how that parameter is approached . Having this extra amount of knowledge is extremely valuable to the design team when they are to decide on actions such as rework and planning of future activities and phases . Initial feedback from industry representatives in the VIVACE project shows promise in supporting this with the knowledge maturity approach . This is an important aspect , especially in a business offer context , as the kind of precision that is mandatory in the technical domain , regarding for instance weight , thrust , and fuel burn in the aeronautical domain , is harder to reach in the business domain . 9 FUTURE WORK This paper reports on the initial development of the Gated Maturity Assessment technique and the ideas behind knowledge maturity , but there is more work to come . First , the development of the GMA technique is ongoing with evaluation and validation in a business process context being underway . Then , as the concept should work in virtually any stage - gate process context , it is a future whish to bring the ideas forward and test them in a wider ( functional ) product development context , where new challenges and issues can be found . 10 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This work was performed in the European Union’s 6 th Framework Programme project VIVACE ( Sixth Framework Programme contract number AIP - CT - 2003 - 502917 ) .

Larsson 1 ( 1 ) Division of Functional Product Development , Luleå University of Technology , Luleå , Sweden ( 2 ) Division of Entrepreneurship and Industrial Organization , Luleå University of Technology , Luleå , Sweden ABSTRACT In stage - gate processes decisions are made based on the knowledge and information developed during the preceding phase . The purpose of this study is to explore the state - of - practice in industry regarding the assessment of knowledge and information at gates . The result indicates that gate reviews relate mainly to assessments of technical performance and function . Relatively little attention is given to assess the quality of the knowledge base , making it difficult to identify outdated , irrelevant and non - applicable information and knowledge . Further , tacit knowledge plays an important role in the decision - making process , as reviewers ask for the design rationale and further evidence of what has been done and why . However , evaluating such knowledge is currently a poorly understood aspect of gate reviews . It is concluded that even though the specific focus of such meetings is not on the evaluation of knowledge and information , the opportunity to work towards a better support of such activities is promising , especially since the respondents perceive the benefits that come from an increased attention to assessments of both the explicit and tacit knowledge base used in gate reviews . Keywords : Knowledge management , stage - gate process , decision support , maturity 1 INTRODUCTION Striving for innovation and generating new ideas and product offerings is one way for firms to stay competitive in a business environment driven by globalization and fierce competition . In this environment firms need to team up in strategic alliances , such as virtual enterprises [ 1 ] , to make effective use of each other’s competitive advantage , i . e . their knowledge , when developing new product and service offerings . Being able to trust each other’s information and knowledge will then be an important part of the day - to - day work ; therefore , ensuring confidence in the material used in product development processes , such as the common stage - gate process [ 2 ] , is paramount . Ensuring that the knowledge used in decision - making is valid , mature and of high quality will become increasingly important , since this is the main constituent that actions are based upon . Identifying situations when the knowledge base is of low quality is crucial to avoid loosely - based decision - making . A better understanding of the knowledge base status promises better results from future actions in the product development process , since it becomes clearer whether or not additional work is needed at decision points . Hence , a decision support that can help ensure the high quality and maturity of the knowledge and information is needed , or at least to help decision makers in conducting an honest appraisal of the knowledge base and determine a clear course of action depending on the current level of maturity . Until now the main work in this area has been to evaluate stage - gate from a learning perspective , i . e . [ 3 , 4 ] , to evaluate the rigidity of stage - gate versus facilitation of learning . Gated maturity assessment [ 5 ] was an action - based development effort , where the respondents assisted in the development of the assessment method and its tool , while they elaborated on issues seen in companies today . However , to guarantee that the right problem is solved , some groundwork in this area is required . Therefore , this paper will attempt to fill this void , by stepping back slightly and examining the problem situation in industry today , when it comes to the relation between decision - making practices and the status of the knowledge assets used to support gate reviews . ICED’09 / 342 The purpose of this study is to examine decision - making in new product development ( NPD ) from two Swedish manufacturing companies . From this , two sub - goals can be derived . Firstly , the focus is to identify the knowledge and information required in the decision - making process in new product development , and to gain an understanding for how it is used . Secondly , the aim is to identify the critical aspects that influence decision - making in new product development . Essentially , this research work stems from the hypothesis that assessing maturity and thus the quality of knowledge in a decision - making situation will positively influence the quality of the decisions taken . This should lead to better quality in projects , though many other factors influence project success , i . e . it might be able to measure this in terms of performance measurements . The research approach used in this paper describes the design of the study , the data collection and the analysis and relates them to the literature . Further , the case companies and respondents are shortly presented . After this the theoretical background is presented , focusing on areas related to stage - gate , knowledge management and maturity . Thereafter a report on the interview results follows . Finally , the paper is rounded off with a discussion of the results , the conclusions that can be drawn from the paper , and some elaboration on future work . 2 RESEARCH APPROACH This paper is based on a multiple case study [ 6 ] performed at two Swedish manufacturing companies . Case study was chosen because the purpose is ( partly ) derived from a “how” - based research question ( i . e . How are knowledge and information used in the Stage - gate decision process ? ) , the focus is on contemporary events , and finally , it is not possible to conduct an experiment because the area of focus is embedded in the processes . According to Yin ( 2003 ) this points towards case studies being a viable approach . This study was conducted as a multiple case study [ 6 ] , since the two companies operate in two rather distinct environments , adding variety to the sample . The stage - gate process is common , but its application is often quite different . In addition , having multiple cases provides varying views of the studied phenomena and the possibility to compare results [ 7 ] . The main unit of analysis [ 6 ] in this study is the respondents’ perception of the information and knowledge that they prepare for and bring to the gate meetings . What is the form of information and knowledge ? What are the contents ? What is the quality of the information and knowledge ? How is it used to aid decision - making ? As sampling criterion , the respondents should have long experience from different development projects within areas related to the innovation process . The modes of data collection were semi - structured interviews and workshops with respondents at both case companies . These modes were chosen because they allow the respondents the freedom to speak from their experience of working at the companies . The respondents’ stories and experiences were important to capture in this phase of the study . Telephone interviews were performed and recorded to be replayed later and transcribed . The atmosphere of the conversations was understood to be quite honest ; the interviewees stated clearly when they could not answer a question . Therefore , the risk that the respondents were guessing or making up answers to any questions is assumed quite small . During the analysis , any answers with a risk that the respondents might have misunderstood the question were removed from further analysis . In the analysis , the recordings made during the interviews were first transcribed . These transcripts were sent to the interviewees for iteration , so that they could read , agree or correct , and comment on the answers . At this point they also responded to questions that the researchers developed during the initial screening and analysis of the material . Thereafter , themes originating from the purpose of the study were used to classify the information provided by the respondents . The data were reduced , where information and quotes were ordered in a mind map to provide an overview of the contents , which then formed the basis for the report , i . e . this article . Based on the material , a story of the current situation in the case companies unfolded , with several quotes from the interviews used to further illustrate some important points . Of note , a need to complement the data from this study with other types of data and make use of triangulation is still needed [ 6 ] . This is further elaborated upon in the future work section . ICED’09 / 342 3 THE CASE COMPANIES AND THE RESPONDENTS In this study , two Swedish manufacturing companies participated . These companies and their respondents have been anonymized in this paper and will be referred to as Company A and B , and Respondent A1 , A2 , B1 and B2 . Company A is a developer and manufacturer of components for both civil and military airplane engines as well as rocket engines used for space applications and gas turbine engines . Further , they have a business in the maintenance , repair and overhaul ( MRO ) of airplane engines . They usually work as a tier 1 supplier or risk - and - revenue - sharing partner to the main engine integrators of airplane engines . The company has a business philosophy of working very closely with their partners . Respondent A1 is employed as an industrial Ph . D . Student at Company A , but is not affiliated to the same university as the authors , or directly involved in this study . He is educated as an engineer and has 13 years experience at the company . He has worked as a line manager at the company and has participated in several projects related to technology development . Respondent A2 works as a project leader for a technology development project at Company A and holds a Master of Science and Business Administration . He has 16 years experience at the company , including working in different areas and locations ( i . e . Sweden , USA ) . Company B is a manufacturer of tools for the metalworking industry , with products in areas such as turning , milling and drilling . They mainly develop their products in - house , but are heavily reliant on the cooperation with their customers to identify and understand the needs and problems to address . Respondent B1 is a manager at the milling department of Company B and responsible for design and product development . He has worked there since 1985 , during which time he has held different positions , such as product leader , designer and developer . Respondent B2 is product development manager for drilling tools at Company B . His educational background is in mechanical engineering . He has 10 years experience at the company . During this period he worked as development engineer and later in various product management positions . 4 THEORETICAL BACKGROUND 4 . 1 Decision - making in New Product Development ( NPD ) One of the primary focuses of the stage - gate process is decision - making [ 8 ] . The idea is to decide to either continue or disband a project as early as possible , to reduce wasting resources on projects that show little promise . Stage - gate is based [ 8 ] on principles of rational decision - making [ 9 ] . Rational theories of decision - making are mainly based on four aspects [ 9 ] : knowledge of alternatives , knowledge of consequences of alternative actions , consistent preference ordering , and a decision rule by which to select a single alternative of action . This is reflected in the Stage - Gate model . 4 . 1 . 1 Stage - Gate Stage - gate , developed by Cooper [ 2 , 10 ] , is a process that moves projects from idea to launch of product . It is based on a process referred to as phased review [ 2 , 10 ] or phased project planning [ 3 ] , which NASA implemented [ 3 ] during the 1960s to manage development projects by breaking the process into stages with reporting in - between . At that time , projects were very complex because they were essentially at the forefront of technical development . Therefore , the phased process was implemented to gain control of the projects and to either cancel or re - prioritize projects at an earlier stage [ 3 ] . Stage - gate can be seen as a set of information - gathering activities [ 10 ] . The overall process map is showed in Figure 1 below . ICED’09 / 342 Figure 1 . Stage - gate process overview ( from [ 10 ] ) . The main structure of stage - gate is the presence of one stage , where activities take place and one gate where information is assessed and decisions are made , see Figure 2 . These two are described more in detail below . Figure 2 . Stage - gate structure with a stage followed by a gate ( from [ 10 ] ) . Each stage can be seen as a information and knowledge gathering activity that produces deliverables as input to the gate [ 10 ] , see Figure 2 . Within each stage , activities are normally undertaken in parallel and sequentially . The role of the gate is to evaluate what has been done in the previous stage and to decide the way forward , what should be done in the next stage , how that path forward should be undertaken and how much resources should be allocated for the next stage [ 10 ] . Reviewers evaluate the information , or the deliverables , developed during the stage . This information is matched against a number of criteria to make a decision . According to Cooper [ 2 ] , the reviewers have four options to choose from . The first option is “GO” , when the project is fine and can keep going onto the next stage . Resources are allocated for continued work . The opposite of this is “KILL” , when the work has not progressed as expected and moving further presents a major risk , and the project is thus terminated . In the middle is either the option to “HOLD” or to “RECYCLE” , meaning that providing certain changes are made , the project can still go on . Once at the gate , Cooper [ 10 ] advocates the use of scorecards to score the project against a set of predefined key criteria . These criteria include , for instance ( from Cooper [ 10 ] , p . 227 ) : • Alignment with business strategy and impact on business • Competitive advantage of product • Market potential and attractiveness • Leverage of core competencies • Technical feasibility • Financial reward versus risk 4 . 2 Information and knowledge Information and knowledge are usually defined in relation [ 11 ] to one another , to define the relation of the terms data , information , knowledge , and wisdom [ 12 ] . This can be done using the Data— Information—Knowledge—Wisdom ( DIKW ) hierarchy [ 13 ] , also known as the knowledge hierarchy or the knowledge pyramid , see Figure 3 . ICED’09 / 342 Figure 3 : Knowledge Pyramid also known as knowledge hierarchy or DIKW hierarchy ( adapted from [ 13 ] ) . Data is about the raw facts and symbols ; it has no meaning by itself and no relation to other data or information . Information is data that has been given meaning and understanding by relating it to other datasets and other information . Knowledge appears when even more understanding and context are added and when , by combining different sets of information and data [ 11 ] , a pattern appears . Data and information are about the past , but knowledge is more about the present , when you can start taking action and make decisions based on it . Knowledge is also about knowing “how” , which relates to actions . Wisdom is about the future , where accurate forecasts on the impacts of decisions and actions can be produced . Wisdom is about knowing “why” . In this paper information and knowledge depict the material produced and the learning that people do in the development process . Another way to relate to knowledge is to distinguish between tacit and explicit knowledge [ 14 ] . Tacit knowledge is dependant on the people who possess it and their contexts . It is difficult to write down and codify so that it can be shared in a document format . Explicit knowledge is the opposite , the kind found in documents , written down and codified . 4 . 3 Maturity Maturity is a way to assess the state of completeness and predictability of either an artifact or in a process . Bohn [ 15 ] defines maturity of knowledge as “understanding the effects of the input variables on the output” ( Bohn [ 15 ] , p . 63 ) . He further states that : “The manager ' s or process engineer ' s goal is to manipulate the raw materials , controls and environment to get output that is as good as possible . It is customary to treat the environmental variables as exogenous and uncontrollable . However , with enough knowledge , the environmental variables can be turned into control variables and , therefore , are not exogenous” ( Bohn [ 15 ] , p . 63 ) There are two widely adopted frameworks on maturity in different industrial sectors , Technology Readiness Level ( TRL ) and Capability Maturity Model ( CMM ) , where the latter has evolved into Capability Maturity Model Integrated ( CMMI ) in later years . TRL is a concept that was developed by NASA [ 16 ] to work as a framework and guide the development of technologies and systems to be used in space missions . Because the cost of any failure can be extremely high , there is a need to ensure that any component or system being fitted onto a product going into space is properly and sufficiently tested and validated in environments relevant to the final mission . The TRL features a 9 - level criterion scale that represents technologies in development from a research / laboratory state to a “flight proven” implementation in a product . CMM / CMMI was developed to support software engineering [ 17 ] . It was previously common that development projects ran over time , over budget and did not deliver the functionality as promised . Successes were often dependant on the heroic efforts of individuals , and when they did not work on a project , the project failed . Therefore , CMM / CMMI models were developed to assess the capability of development processes in the software companies . This is in contrast to TRL , where the artifact is assessed . A company with high process maturity will meet targets on time and budget , because the development process is well developed . Further , there is also a level of repeatability in a mature process , where companies continuously manage to deliver . Based on the maturity frameworks of TRL and CMM / CMMI , Johansson et al [ 5 ] have explored the use of maturity thinking in the context of knowledge , rather than technologies or processes . The idea behind this knowledge maturity concept is to narratively prescribe the necessary activities and the necessary level of detail needed to sufficiently fulfill a level and pass a decision point with confidence . As it works prescriptively , it is also a way to evaluate the level of knowledge . In this work , knowledge is based on three dimensions , viz . the input to the project , the method used to refine and create ICED’09 / 342 knowledge , and the experience and expertise of the people doing the work . Figure 4 depicts a generic scale that is intended to be adapted to the specific working context . Figure 4 . Knowledge Maturity criterion , adapted from [ 5 ] . 5 RESULTS Findings from the interviews are presented here , beginning with an overview of the development process in the respective companies and an overview of the gate meetings . The focus is then on the knowledge and information in the gate meetings . Innovation & Innovation process Innovation activities at the case companies are managed through a series of processes with activities that take the products from ideas to finished product . The drivers of innovation are different in the two companies . In Company A , common aerospace industry goals drive the direction of aerospace development and what type of development efforts the company should focus on . In Company B , the voice of the customer is an important driver together with the technology insight that drives the development of new technologies . Company B works very closely with “driving customers” ( i . e . lead users [ 18 ] ) from markets that the company prioritizes , because they believe these markets will grow better than average and still have representative needs for their other customer base . In both companies , new product development activities are divided into sub - processes , called technology development and product development in Company A , and knowledge development and product development in Company B . Product development contains little uncertainty , i . e . the products are very well - defined . When this part of the development project is initiated , they have little doubt that they cannot deliver . In Company A contracts are signed before this phase is initiated , in Company B there is a fixed launch date . In the phase prior to product development ( technology or knowledge development ) , both companies have development activities to ensure that they master their technologies and know enough about the technology to introduce it to product development . In Company A , technology development projects follow the TRL scale from level one to level six ( out of nine ) , before being handed over to product development . In Company B , similar activities are referred to as knowledge development projects . Stage - Gate process In both companies , processes are managed with a stage - gate influenced process to control the process and make decisions . In Company A , the process has been redesigned compared to Cooper’s definition [ 2 , 10 ] , where several gates have been added . Further , the decisions are divided into either two or three meetings , depending on if the customer is involved in the decision process at the particular gate or not . The first point is the technical review meeting , where technical details and technical feasibility are reviewed . This works as input to the main gate meeting , where the focus is on risk , scheduling and ICED’09 / 342 cost issues . The final part is the customer gate meeting , where technical progress and scheduling are again the main interest for the customer . Company A values input from the customer and collaboration with the customer very highly . The stage - gate process in Company B is very similar to the definitions by Cooper [ 2 , 10 ] and is managed with a computer support using predefined templates that must be filled out and stipulate what should be taken care of during the gate meeting . Gates All company functions affected by the project are represented from the management at the decision meeting and from the project the project leader is present . In Company B , where the decision has little uncertainty and the material is of good quality , the project leader may not even be required to take part . In Company A , due to the nature of technical review meetings , technical experts are present . The main focus in an internal gate meeting is on the business case and representatives from these functions are therefore present , whereas at the customer gate meeting the engine integrator hosts the meeting and key personnel from Company A are present . Some gates are more important than others , where shortcuts and bending the gate criteria are not accepted . At Company A , the most important gate meetings are those involving the customer , because they are so dependant on what their customers , the engine integrators , think . Gate meetings with management are also important , because this where resources for the next phase are decided . In Company B , the most important gates are those where big investments are due or where stock buildup needs to be decided . It is very rare in both companies that projects in the product development phase are stopped at the gates . Projects in Company A are managed a bit softer due to , for instance , contractual terms . “…we already signed the contracts with our partners , so it would be a breach of contract actually…” In Company B , introduction dates are an important driver . Therefore , they sometimes have to take a shortcut if time is short . This is especially true for high profile projects . “…most of the times it ' s successful , but the risk that something is forgotten or that something goes wrong are of course very high . ” Both companies usually try to catch up as much as possible during the course of the project , and still meet the final deadline . For instance , the project leader in Company A has to devise a detailed plan with actions for catching up with the things that fall behind at a particular gate . However , technology development and knowledge development phases have a stronger incentive to make sure that projects going through are mature . Developments can be either reworked or killed , because the technology is either too complex , too costly , or not sophisticated enough , to name a few reasons . Presently , neither company focuses explicitly on knowledge or information and the quality in the gate reviews . They are mainly concerned with aspects such as product performance , if the function meets the specification , if the time schedule is met , what the cost is , and so on . It is usually assumed that the people in the project are knowledgeable , that they learn , and that the knowledge base builds during the course of the project . One respondent at Company A said : “…it ' s kind of assumed that the people who are involved in the development , they learn as they go through product development , and they build up their personal knowledge and this is reused in the next project when they enter into the next project , and they take that knowledge with them . But it ' s very much their own knowledge” However , Company A has a design justification file where they document the progress made and why things look the way they do . Company B is moving towards focusing more explicitly on knowledge to ensure that they document their activities better with rationale for each gate . One respondent said : “…when you start the project with more knowledge , the project time will be shorter . ” As with knowledge in general , tacit knowledge is not an explicit topic at the gate reviews . However , there is an indirect understanding for it . One respondent at Company A said that the management group is interested in who has done the work or who the project leader is : ICED’09 / 342 “…you are always interested in who has done this analysis , or who is leading this project , or who are the designers involved in this design group…” Further , when project teams are assembled , there is an understanding for the concept of tacit knowledge , as reflected in this quote regarding when experienced project leaders want to recruit team members : “When I worked as a line manager…they gave me a list of names of the people who they wanted for their project team . And it was always the list with the dream team . ” It is understood that an experienced team has an influence on the end result , the quality of the work , and on the time and money spent on the project . An experienced team knows what to do , where are the challenges and where they should focus . Similarly , in Company B experience is an important element for passing the gates . Regarding gut feeling , in particular , there is no doubt that this is an important component in the gate meetings . In Company A gut feeling is important , but this needs to be supported with figures and data , and technical information to prove the validity in decisions is therefore important : “If you say my feeling is that this will work and you have twenty years of experience , then the review team will say ‘fine that sounds really good , that makes us more comfortable , but we need you to come up with the figures that support your gut feeling’ . ” One respondent at Company B said that they come from a tradition of very much trusting their gut feeling . They trust their employees highly . In some cases , gut feeling may help bend the rules slightly at the gate , where the project leader says that he / she has a feeling that things will be ok for the next gate . Still , Company B is moving towards a more fact - based style of assessing the gates , where as at Company A , you need to come up with the figures . In both companies however , gut feeling needs to complement the facts . As one respondent at Company B said : “If the project members are not convinced themselves , or believe in the product , we have a huge problem . Because if you don ' t believe in it , it won ' t happen , it ' s just that simple . ” Further , he said that there is a risk when you have contradictory analysis results , when teams want it so badly that they do not see the bad result and try to understand why things are the way they are . This is where decision makers have to be careful and try to be aware of the state of the team’s gut feeling . A gut feeling can also tip over changes to design solutions , if the gut feeling is that the original option will not work . Table 1 below summarizes some of the main points from the interviews to provide the reader an overview of the results from the two companies . ICED’09 / 342 Table 1 . Summary of interview results 6 DISCUSSION Knowledge is focused upon in this study because based on knowledge , actions are taken [ 11 ] . This is especially interesting in this context , since the purpose of the gate meeting in the Stage - Gate process is to make decisions and take action . Therefore , it is not inconceivable to assume that the better knowledge and quality of knowledge ( i . e . better quality of result from development activities ) in the stage - gate process , the better are the decisions and actions . Presently , neither company explicitly focuses on knowledge and information . In Company A , it is assumed that project teams learn in the project , but this is not verified . It is interesting to relate to Engwall [ 3 ] , who says that product development is a knowledge journey and that you have to allow for learning in the stage - gate process . Therefore , it seems reasonable that to check that you have actually learned something when making decisions . There is an importance to not only focus on the performance related aspects more explicitly in the gate meetings , but also on the knowledge that these aspects reflect and the maturity of this knowledge . Clarifying that the performance aspects should still be the central focus of the gate meetings is necessary , but there is a need to bring in the knowledge maturity aspect as a complement to the review process . Making progress in a project is not just about meeting the technical objective in terms of performance ; it is also about learning about the product . This is essentially the core of the knowledge maturity idea . Having high knowledge maturity is a reflection of you having learned about the product you are developing and that unpleasant surprises are rare or non - existent . The lack of focus regarding knowledge and information is consistent with findings from a previous study [ 19 ] , where comments from industry experts point towards the issue of assumptions versus facts when presenting solutions and concepts for decisions . In that case , the feedback was that it was difficult to differentiate assumptions from the proven facts because people wanted things so badly . Just because you reach a desired level of performance or functionality in a conceptual design activity does not mean that this will be the end product . From the interviews it is evident today that the main Company A Company B Innovation Driver Common industry goals Voice of the customer ; driving customers R & D process ( pre - PD ) Yes ; “Technology Development” Yes ; “Knowledge Development Process” Stage - gate Yes ; revised according to company needs Yes ; computer support with pre - defined templates Decision meetings ( gate meetings ) Technical review ( tech . experts ) ; Internal Gate meeting ( business case & management ) ; Customer Gate Meeting ( engine integrator ; technical focus ) Review of templates Gate “let - through” ( i . e . without fulfilling criterion ) Yes ; catch up during the project ( contracts have penalties for delays ; final gate important due to aerospace regulations ) Yes ; catch up or modify acceptance criteria ( introduction dates are drivers ) Knowledge and information focus N ot explicit ; implicit assumption and understanding ; design j ustification file contains rationale N ot explicit ; more focus will come in future with new developments to p rocess Tacit knowledge focus N ot explicit ; indirect understanding ; “who” is important ; dream team formation by experienced project managers ; tacit knowledge needs the figures and facts as well N ot explicit ; experience is an important element ; trust gut feeling ; moving towards more fact - based decision Maturity thinking Yes ; TRL drives development ( Technology development versus Product Development ) N ot explicitly ICED’09 / 342 focuses of the gate meetings are the performance and function aspects of the material , and not the learning aspects or quality of information and knowledge created in the process . This lack of knowledge and information focus is something that they feel is either a disadvantage or they are making strides towards improving . Further , it is interesting to see in the interviews that the gates seem to lack the teeth or influence that Cooper ( 2008 ) [ 10 ] prescribes . In these companies keeping the projects running and not falling behind with deliveries is more important ; thus , only in extreme cases are projects stopped . In Company A , product development is based on contracts with customers and partners . These contracts have clauses that make it a breach of contract to stop a project at a gate . Therefore , they try to catch up during the course of the project . Cooper [ 10 ] brings up this phenomena as “’We never kill projects , we just wound them . ’” ( p . 218 , [ 10 ] ) . On a similar note , we have comments from one of the case companies , when discussing these issues , stating that “ [ the stage - gate ] is the law [ of the company ] , but where is the sheriff ? ” ; pointing towards the different views on this topic . Theoretically [ 10 ] , the main objective with the stage - gate process is to facilitate the movement of a product from idea to launch in as an effective and efficient manner as possible . Feeding into this , the main purpose of the gate is to take GO / KILL decisions to facilitate the overall objective with the stage - gate process . What is evident from our studies is that reality is not as clear - cut as Cooper states . In practice HALT or KILL are very rare , it is more that you try to appreciate the risk of going forward with a GO decision that might not have full confidence and devise a suitable action plan for how to catch up . A maturity approach could help companies in their current situations and further assure better confidence for decision makers . Having a good understanding of the limitations and benefits with their current knowledge base is better than not knowing anything about it at all . In technology development in Company A and knowledge development in Company B , there is , however , an incentive to at least not push the project through . In these activities there are no contracts with external partners or launch dates that pressure the project . In fact , here you do not want the technology to move into product development at an immature stage . Only once it proves to provide a benefit for the company , it will be taken into the product development stage . There is a need to value information and knowledge more easily and to reduce the dependency of individuals in the team . It should be possible for outsiders to contribute to the development effort and to solve problems if the picture of what knowledge already exists , what knowledge needs to evolve and what knowledge is missing altogether are clear . 7 CONCLUSIONS This has been an explorative study whose purpose was to examine decision - making in new product development ( NPD ) in two Swedish manufacturing companies . From this , two sub - goals were derived . First , to identify the knowledge and information required in the decision - making process in new product development , and to get an understanding for how it is used , and second , to identify the critical aspects that influence decision - making in new product development . General conclusions It is quite evident that the main focus of the gate meetings in both companies is the performance and function related aspects , together with others such as business case feasibility and risk . Decisions are taken when the performance or business case matches what is good enough , i . e . the performance indicators indicate that the product should have a desired level of performance or the business case indicates that the company will make a certain profit . However , decisions are also occasionally taken when they have to and not when the performance or the business case is healthy . Regarding knowledge and information , content is needed but quality is not a specific topic in its own right . Of course , it is a feature in the sense that a certain level of evidence is needed , such as a certain method for analysis ( i . e . simulation , physical tests , etc . ) . Knowing this in advance , they plan for it and try to perform what is good enough . However , no true acceptance criteria exist in terms of what quality level in the knowledge base is sufficient to make a confident decision . Industrial implications Since this study has had a descriptive focus , the main contribution of this article towards an industrial perspective is mainly the awareness of the opportunities available from attaining a more explicit focus concerning knowledge and information , as discussed in this paper . ICED’09 / 342 For instance , a more pragmatic handling of gate decisions is an example where focusing on knowledge maturity could support in making a more confident decision about how to handle the gate , which actions are necessary and how much resources should be devoted to catching up with the particular item . ‘How much do we know ? ’ and ‘What are the difficulties we can expect ? ’ are some of the questions that can be asked and answered when more attention is given to the knowledge aspects . This study points to the value of both tacit knowledge and gut feeling in the process and its implicit understanding . However , focusing more explicitly and systematically on this factor is valuable to have a greater conscious of it when managing projects and taking decisions . Academic contribution This study has pinpointed the pragmatic perspective of stage - gate found in the companies as a point where practice differs from the theoretical view presented by Cooper [ 2 , 10 ] . This echoes some of the critique that other authors have voiced regarding the rigidity of Cooper’s stage - gate . This provides an opportunity to further investigate this aspect and find ways of supporting these decisions that become even more delicate . ‘Should the project be allowed to continue even though the criteria are not fulfilled ? ’ . This is a question that should be supported to provide better confidence for the decision makers . In the theory [ 2 , 10 ] , the stage in the stage - gate process is regarded as an information gathering activity that creates a foundation for the decisions needed to be taken in the gate . However , from this study and the theory it is evident that there is no real focus on the quality of the information and resulting knowledge created in the gate , when the decisions are to be taken . Hence , the main focus is what the content says , i . e . what is the function , performance , etc . that can be drawn from the product . This finding provides opportunities for an increased focus on maturity of knowledge as well as product in the gate decision . 8 FUTURE WORK To further improve the work , more sources of evidence should be investigated [ 6 ] , what Yin [ 6 ] refers to as triangulation . Therefore , it would be of interest to observe a typical gate meeting in either of the companies , as well as study archival data , such as process descriptions , guidelines for gate meetings , and protocols from previous gate meetings . Also , it would be interesting to interview more people in other functions at the two companies to gain an even better picture of the situation . More interviews are needed , especially from complimentary areas of expertise , as both companies try to form the development work and the decision - making around cross - functional teams . On a more specific note , it would be interesting to dig deeper into the more pragmatic handling of the gates decisions , where many things are allowed to pass the gate with action plans , instead of being stopped as theory [ 2 , 10 ] prescribes . Understanding the reasons behind this , finding the nuances where different decisions are taken and then naturally being able to support these kinds of decisions made so often in the development processes is of great interest for future efforts .

Johansson @ ltu . se This paper investigates the stage - gate process and related decision making practices in an aerospace company by exploring how the stage - gate approach supports dealing with ambiguity and uncertainty at the decision gates . The stage - gate process was found to be more than a decision making mechanism , facilitating communication , discussion and knowledge sharing between team members . Similar to the concept of a boundary object , the stage - gate process supports knowledge creation and the shaping of the boundaries between people’s perceptions of the knowledge base , and the knowledge elements brought to such meetings often take the form of boundary negotiating artefacts . However , this communicative and negotiating function of the stage - gate approach is often implicit and dependent on participating individuals’ ability to reflect on the status of the available knowledge assets . The role of the knowledge maturity concept is to facilitate the knowledge creation process by acting in itself as a boundary object , to highlight the current status of the knowledge base , and to make stakeholders aware of the project’s uncertainties and ambiguities . By doing so they can take appropriate action , mitigate risk and focus their efforts on improving the knowledge assets where they are needed most and thus make more confident decisions . Keywords : product development ; knowledge management ; stage - gate ; decision making ; maturity Introduction To be competitive in the global marketplace , product developing companies need to constantly improve their offers and processes to stay ahead of competitors . One priority is to cut lead times in the product development process . By being able to launch a product onto the market earlier than their competitors , they can beat the opposition . In the aerospace industry , this goal is similar to other industries , albeit with particularly strong 2 ( 35 ) requirements to comply with rigorous requirements and regulations ( e . g . flight safety concerns ) . One challenge of cutting lead times without sacrificing quality and performance is that the decision making process needs to be rationalised ( Larsson et al . 2006 ) . To meet this challenge , many companies use the stage - gate process ( Cooper 2001 , 2008 ) to manage the development effort and aid effective decision making . To add further complexity , the nature of the products ( Acha et al . 2007 ) and the industry ( Prencipe 2004 ) ( e . g . investments and risks cannot be managed by one single company ) means that companies are usually closely intertwined in strategic partnerships with other companies , such as virtual enterprises ( Davidow and Malone 1993 , Hardwick and Bolton 1997 , Browne and Zhang 1999 ) and extended enterprises ( Boardman and Clegg 2001 , Browne and Zhang 1999 , Ericksen and Suri 2001 ) ( e . g . Engine Alliance ( Engine Alliance Public Website 2008 ) ) , sometimes operating in a mode of coopetition ( Brandenburger et al . 1995 ) , i . e . companies can be both collaborators and competitors simultaneously . In a stage - gate process , information and knowledge assets of many different kinds ( e . g . analysis results , technical reports , drawings , lessons learned and rationale , physical and digital mock - ups , etc . ) are created , collected and shared during the different stages , when engineering work is performed , to reflect the learning about the product . In addition , tacit knowledge ( Polanyi 1967 ) and experience plays a crucial part since decisions also need to be made even when available documentation is scarce , thus relying more heavily on experience - based opinions and even assumptions . Tacit knowledge is often understood to comprise the main body of knowledge , where Polanyi ( 1967 ) proposes that we “know more than we can tell” ( Polanyi 1967 , p . 4 ) , signalling that tacit knowledge is difficult to capture in documentation , and is normally said to belong to an 3 ( 35 ) individual , residing in the heads of people ( Polanyi 1967 ) . At the gate , both explicit and tacit information and knowledge provide the basis for decisions . An issue in the context of gate review meetings is the role of ambiguity and uncertainty . Carleton , Cockayne and Leifer ( 2008 ) distinguish ambiguity and uncertainty , with ambiguity as “not knowing what to measure , how to structure any measurements , or possibly even where to start looking for variables” ( ibid . , p . 1 ) , and uncertainty as “the state in which variables are identified , although the parameters may be incomplete , insufficient or imprecise” ( ibid , p . 1 ) . In product development , especially from an innovation perspective , ambiguity should be preserved to keep a wide and open design space ( Bucciarelli 1994 ) , and thus avoid premature closure . However , from a project risk management perspective , when passing the gate to the next stage , ambiguity and uncertainty can also be negative ( Stacey and Eckert 2003 ) , posing a risk to the decision makers that they will have to deal with and make trade offs , where there are gaps in the decision base . In such cases , it could be argued that the project has low knowledge maturity ( Johansson et al . 2009 ) , meaning that the knowledge base is flawed , consisting of placeholder values ( Flanagan et al . 2007 ) , uncertain information about competitors ( Rosenzweig 2007 ) , assumptions ( ibid . ) , missing information ( ibid . ) , etcetera , depicting that a detailed understanding of the ambiguities and uncertainties is missing , potentially having a negative influence on decision making because the company finds itself in a position of satisficing ( i . e . satisfying and sufficing at the same time ) ( Simon 1955 , 1979 ) when making decisions , thus reducing confidence for the decision makers , which is essentially what the knowledge maturity concept is all about ; assuring that the decision makers feel confident in their decisions by providing them and the design teams with a means of knowing in which areas to focus their 4 ( 35 ) attention and how to make the best use of their resources in light of ambiguity and uncertainty . Since product development activities in the aerospace industry are growing in complexity and scope ( Flanagan et al . 2007 , Acha et al . 2007 ) , such development activities will always include aspects of ambiguity and uncertainty . However , there is a need to deal more confidently with such situations where all knowledge is not in place , since decisions in the gates still need to be taken . An initial step towards a solution is to provide decision makers with an increased awareness of the situation and the knowledge assets under review . Knowing about ambiguities and uncertainties at the gate reviews provides awareness for the team to manage and mitigate these uncertainties , allowing decision makers to make confident decisions . Here , the concept of ‘conscious uncertainty’ ( Modica and Rustichini 1994 ) is interesting , a state of knowing that we do not know something ( e . g . ‘known unknowns’ ) . Establishing this type of increased awareness about what the project team knows , captured in the observation “If only HP knew what HP knows” ( Sieloff 1999 ) , could make decision makers more confident in their decisions at the gates . In previous work that focused on the role of knowledge and information in the stage - gate in the aerospace industry as well as the metal cutting tools industry ( Johansson et al . 2009 ) , a main finding was that the status and quality of the information and knowledge assets brought to gate meetings was not an explicit point of discussion . The main focus at the gate meeting was instead on product attributes such as performance and function . The results brought forward at the gate denote knowledge that the team has created on how the product is likely to perform in operation and what features it will have . However , the maturity of this knowledge seemed to be of less interest than the 5 ( 35 ) content , or face value , it displayed . Uncertain placeholder values are occasionally mistaken for exact requirements and , similarly , exact values are sometimes mistaken for placeholders ( Stacey and Eckert 2003 ) ; this lack of process rationale poses risks related to the traceability of decisions throughout the process and increases the likelihood that decisions will be based on ill - founded assumptions . Further , when considering the role of the gate , decision makers will rarely opt to terminate a project once it has passed the first gate and approved to go - ahead . Realistically , the main stopping point is before development starts and , in the aerospace case , before the partners sign contracts with each other , binding them to deliver . Thereafter , it is important to keep up with the established timelines and in a controlled manner , a challenge for the company in many projects . In the aerospace industry , there is a regulatory framework to pay close attention to regarding , for example flight safety regulations . Of course , this is the highest priority , i . e . if there are risks to flight safety the project partners may be forced to delay projects . Apart from this , the company seeks to match the progress of their partners , and avoid causing unwanted ripple effects throughout the extended enterprise . The main purpose of this paper is to further investigate the role of the stage - gate process at an aerospace industry case company and gain a deeper understanding of how the gated process and the decision making practices relate to ambiguity and uncertainty . This aspect is focused upon because the stage - gate seems to have an additional role apart from making hard decisions on whether or not to terminate projects . This study investigates hidden opportunities and benefits that might arise from a closer assessment of knowledge maturity in the stage - gate process , with the aim to improve the confidence 6 ( 35 ) of decision makers as they manage ambiguity and uncertainty in the product development process . Following this introduction , the research approach , case and background theory is presented . Thereafter , the aerospace context is presented with some aspects being important for the results of the study . Then the results from the study are presented along with analysis of these results , pointing towards the additional role of the stage - gate , facilitating communication and knowledge sharing , apart from a decision making mechanism that is the main focus of it in theory . Finally the some concluding remarks round off the paper . Research approach This paper is based on an in - depth study at an aerospace , where the main objective has been to review current decision making practices from the main perspectives in the stage - gate process , involving respondents from these areas ( e . g . steering group , project leader , etc . ) , thus allowing for an investigation of the stage - gate from different perspectives , and enabling the researcher to look at the situation and the data from several perspectives to strengthen the analysis . Focusing on one company allowed the data collection and analysis to focus on uncovering a deeper understanding of the stage - gate approach performed in the company . Naturally , the possibilities for cross - case analysis and generalisation from the results are reduced with this approach , though at this point , it was fundamental to attain a deeper understanding of stage - gate related practices in the case company . The main aspects of interest in the data collection were to understand the respondents’ perception of the stage - gate process as well as their perception of how they 7 ( 35 ) deal with knowledge related aspects , such as management of assumptions , ambiguity and uncertainty . The respondents were approached for the study , with the help of a gatekeeper ( Neyland 2008 ) at the case company , who knew who would be suitable for this study and who helped to find respondents with long enough experience from working with the stage - gate process in the company , to draw upon experiences with the stage - gate and reflect upon it . Regarding data collection , the main modes were semi - structured interviews ( Yin 2003 , Fontana and Frey 1994 ) and workshops ( Yin 2003 , Fontana and Frey 1994 ) in a mode of group discussion . These approaches are suitable , since they allow the respondents to talk freely based on and drawing from their experiences , sometimes diverging to supplementary topics and areas . This needs to be facilitated and moderated by the researcher , who has to have an analytical lens during data collection to moderate the discussion in the desired direction , and not limit the opportunity to uncover topics that were not anticipated beforehand , which is especially true for the workshop ( Fontana and Frey 1994 ) . In the workshops , findings from previous studies were used to drive the discussions . All interviews and workshops were tape recorded and transcribed to ensure that the researcher did not miss anything in translation to the analysis phase and to ensure that the ‘chain of evidence’ ( Yin 2003 ) is kept intact . A structured questionnaire with open - ended questions was sent to the respondents following the qualitative data collection phase , to supplement the data collected in the interviews and to fill in some apparent lacking details in the initial analysis . A similar 8 ( 35 ) interview guide was sent to other companies in the aerospace domain to confirm common patterns and uncover possible anomalies that could not be regarded as general for the aerospace industry . In either case , the response rate was low with only one response from each group . In the analysis phase , the transcripts were iterated with the respondents , who received the transcripts , allowing them to verify and complement their statements to ensure that the researcher had captured their views correctly , and thus increase the construct validity ( Yin 2003 ) . As a basis for the analysis , the analytical lens of knowledge maturity was used , a perspective that has essentially influenced the whole work . Although the respondents do not talk in explicit terms of knowledge maturity , the researcher can relate the discussed issues to this aspect . Sometimes , what the respondents do not say is as important as what they do say , highlighting a lack of awareness about knowledge maturity related aspects . All transcripts were thoroughly analysed and interesting areas and quotes were given more attention , focusing on knowledge - related aspects of the stage - gate , how they deal with ambiguity and uncertainty , and a perceived lack of knowledge in the stage - gate process . This information was also collected in a mind - map format , where the visual and tangible mode of working allows for a visual representation of links between different interviews and with the theory . This was iterated back and forth with the transcripts , so as not risk losing the holistic overview when focusing on the excerpts . Input from the structured interviews was also included as it became available . In the analysis phase , theoretical constructs such as boundary objects ( Star and Griesemer 1989 ) and bounded rationality ( Simon 1979 ) have played an important role in 9 ( 35 ) making sense ( Yin 2003 ) of the stage - gate’s role and the role of information and knowledge , especially since much of the interest has been on what is not there , and on what perhaps should be there , i . e . the knowledge maturity focus . According to Yin ( 2003 ) , this aspect is important for validity , particularly when single - case studies have been applied to a research project . Company A is a company developing and producing parts of entire aeronautical systems . Their closest partners and customers are Aeronautical Systems original equipment manufacturer ( OEM ) companies . Company B is also a company developing and producing parts of entire aeronautical systems . Similarly to Company A , their closest partners and customers are Aeronautical Systems OEM companies . Company B has contributed with limited information from a structured interview study , primarily to provide a complimentary perspective to the data from Company A , highlighting the role of the aerospace context . The conclusions drawn in the present paper mainly originate from the data gathered from 9 key respondents , i . e . engineers and process developers with different background and skills deeply involved in and experienced from the product development activities of Company A . Theoretical foundation for the research S t age - Ga t e Stage - gate , developed by Cooper ( 2001 ) , is a process that facilitates projects from idea to product launch . It is based on a phased review ( Cooper 2001 , 2008 ) process implemented at NASA called Phased Project Planning ( Engwall 2003 ) , which was first used in the 1960s to manage development projects by dividing the long processes into distinct stages with reporting in - between . The phased process was implemented to gain control of the 10 ( 35 ) projects and to have the option of either cancelling or re - prioritising projects while they are running ( Engwall 2003 ) . The process can be seen as a set of information - gathering activities or phases ( Cooper 2008 ) with evaluation and decision points at intervals in between the phases . The overall process map is showed in Figure 1 below . Figure 1 . Stage - gate process overview ( adopted from ( Cooper 2008 ) ) . The key components of the stage - gate process are the ‘stage’ , where activities take place , and the ‘gate’ , where information is assessed and decisions are made , see Figure 2 . Figure 2 . Stage - gate with a stage followed by a gate ( adopted from ( Cooper 2008 ) ) . Each stage can be seen as an information and knowledge gathering activity that , after analysis and deliberation by the project team , produce deliverables as input to the 11 ( 35 ) gate ( Cooper 2008 ) , see Figure 2 . In the context of Company A , some knowledge elements and information carriers used in the gate meeting are : • Projec t assurance p l an ( PAP ) - This document is structured as a representation of the main criteria document that summarises the project and explains the gate criteria . It is an important document at the gate review , since it is the main artefact used . • Design jus t ifica t ion fi l es - a document collecting rationale on solutions and why the product looks as it does . • Genera l documen t s and t echnica l repor t s - essentially technical reports and similar types of documents . The main points are lifted to the summary document . • Tes t repor t s - the results of various physical tests , such as engine tests , are important ingredients in decisions made at the gate . • Ana l ysis resu lt s – reports on different kinds of analysis , such as Finite Element ( FE ) analysis , Computational Fluid Dynamics ( CFD ) analysis , etc . , provide an important basis for decisions . • Taci t know l edge - the team creates tacit knowledge and builds an implicit understanding of the product . Not all tacit knowledge is recorded in the documents , so access to engineers and experts may be necessary to complement written information . Note that even though decision makers have many sources to use in the decision making process , a crucial challenge is how to assess these information and knowledge sources regarding their fitness - for - purpose . What is the level of readiness of the presented information ? Does the information reflect assumptions or verified facts ? What is missing ? Which areas would need more resources for further development ? Is there a need to prioritise development of some aspects over others ? Also , it is interesting to assess how well these pieces of information and knowledge work in harmony with each other ; i . e . how does the tacit knowledge complement ( or perhaps challenge ) the formal documentation ? Is there an alignment in the knowledge base , or does the gut feeling of the participants contradict the formal data ? In these situations , a degree of ambiguity and uncertainty , e . g . assumptions , etcetera , needs to be handled , perhaps by not initially focusing directly on reducing the 12 ( 35 ) uncertainty , but rather by assisting decision makers in achieving a better understanding of what these ambiguities and uncertainties , and assumptions actually involve . Within each stage , activities are normally conducted simultaneously . The role of the gate is to evaluate what has been done in the previous stage and determine the way forward , what should be done in the next stage , how this path forward should be undertaken and the resources to be allocated for the next stage ( Cooper 2008 ) . Reviewers evaluate the information , or the deliverables , developed during the stage . This information is matched against a number of criteria to make a decision . According to Cooper ( 2001 ) , the reviewers have four options to choose from . The first option is ’Go’ , when the project is healthy and can keep going into the next stage . Resources are then allocated for continued work . The opposite of this is ’Kill’ , when the work has not progressed as expected and moving further presents a major risk , and the project is thus terminated . In the middle , the option is to ’Hold’ or ’Recycle’ , i . e . providing certain changes are made , the project can still continue – with or without a delay depending on the required changes . The main functionality of the stage - gate process is decision making ( Christiansen and Varnes 2006 ) . Christiansen and Varnes ( 2006 ) claim that decision making in the stage - gate prescribes the use of rational choice theory to facilitate arriving at the right decision , essentially whether to go ahead , rework , or terminate a project . Decision Making Mintzberg et al ( 1976 ) define a decision as a specific commitment to action . Further they define the decision process as the “set of actions and dynamic factors that begins with the identification of a stimulus for action and ends with the specific commitment to actions” ( ibid . , p . 246 ) 13 ( 35 ) Rational decision making is related to rational choice theory ( Scott 2000 ) , which is based on the idea that all action is rational and that people calculate costs and benefits of everything they do beforehand . Rational decision making is based on four aspects ( March 1999 ) : knowledge of alternatives , knowledge of consequences of alternative actions , consistent preference ordering , and a decision rule by which to select a single alternative of action . Similarly , according to Simon ( 1979 ) , rational decision making : “…calls for knowledge of all the alternatives that are open to choice . It calls for complete knowledge of , or ability to compute , the consequences that will follow on each of the alternatives . It calls for certainty in the decision maker ' s present and future evaluation of these consequences . It calls for the ability to compare consequences , no matter how diverse and heterogeneous , in terms of some consistent measure of utility . ” ( Ibid . , p . 500 ) However , rational decision making is rarely found in practice ( Simon 1979 ) . Many problems in product development are intrinsically ‘wicked’ ( Rittel and Webber 1973 ) or ‘ill - defined’ ( Cross 1982 ) , since it is virtually impossible to know everything about all alternatives : “there are no true or false answers . [ … ] solutions are expressed as " good " or " bad " or , more likely , as " better or worse " or " satisfying " or " good enough . " ” ( Rittel and Webber 1973 , p . 163 ) . Making a decision is sometimes about settling for what is good enough rather than striving for the optimal solution , i . e . the decision maker needs to approach the situation knowing that the decision made will be based on what could be flawed information . Having a good awareness of what such flaws entail is a first step to solving this issue . Bounded rationality ( Simon 1979 ) , arises when all alternatives are not known , when external factors cannot be managed , or when consequences cannot be calculated ( Simon 1979 ) . ‘Satisficing’ , a combination word of ‘satisfy’ and ‘suffice’ , is an important word in this context , and describes the selection of something that is good enough ( Simon 1979 ) . 14 ( 35 ) Mintzberg et al ( 1976 ) have developed a three - step model for decision making consisting of the phases : ‘identification’ , ‘development’ , and ‘selection’ . The identification phase consists of decision recognition and diagnosis . Development can be both searching for existing solutions and designing customised solutions . Finally , the selection phase has three sub - steps : screen , evaluation - choice , and authorisation , to narrow down the alternatives , evaluate the final alternatives , select and ensure that management supports the decision . Ma t uri t y The word ‘maturity’ in the Oxford dictionary , is defined as “the state of being fully grown or developed” ( Oxford University Press 2000a , p . 791 ) , i . e . the word maturity deals with the description of an end state where something is fully developed or ready , including the assessment of a percentage or a proportion of completeness of an artefact . For instance , Grebici et al ( 2007 ) define maturity as “a compromise between the target uncertainty and the expected uncertainty” ( Ibid . , p . 282 ) , where maturity reflects the distance between the current and the expected ( or final ) level of completeness . A similar concept is expressed by the word ‘readiness’ ( e . g . Technology Readiness Levels or TRL ) , described as “the state of being ready or prepared for sth” ( Oxford University Press 2000b , p . 1053 ) , and is thus also related to the relative difference between the actual status and the targeted status . Bohn ( 1994 ) defines maturity of knowledge as “understanding the effects of the input variables on the output” ( Ibid . , p . 63 ) . In this process , not everything is known . Some aspects can be clearly stated and therefore controlled , whereas others are exogenous and uncontrollable . Bohn ( 1994 ) further states that : “The manager ' s or process engineer ' s goal is to manipulate the raw materials , controls and environment to get output that is as good as possible . It is customary to treat the environmental variables as exogenous and uncontrollable . However , with enough knowledge , 15 ( 35 ) the environmental variables can be turned into control variables and , therefore , are not exogenous” ( p . 63 ) Assessing the maturity of knowledge can be intended as a way to increase the understanding of the position of knowledge in this continuum , between the controllable and the exogenous and uncontrollable to start the process of moving it towards a more controllable state . Knowledge maturity is a concept where the state of readiness , knowledge - wise , in a product is assessed using a narrative scale ( Johansson et al . 2008 ) . The basic idea is to represent knowledge and information over three dimensions : input , method ( + tool ) , and expertise ( + experience ) . The knowledge maturity concept provides a means to assess the level of completeness and reliability of the input data in the process , of the tools used to develop and refine the input into an output , and of the expertise of the people contributing to the activity . Fundamentally , the knowledge maturity concept is intended to support the design team in reasoning these issues by providing a means to visualise and discuss them and thus reach an increased awareness of the maturity of the knowledge base , directing the effort more precisely towards what needs to be improved . In adopting a knowledge maturity approach , engineers can reason about knowledge , or lack thereof , in a manner similar to what they usually do with performance related aspects . The concept of knowledge maturity aims to put knowledge at the centre , to highlight and facilitate a discussion about the perceived status of the knowledge base and to raise the confidence of decision makers dealing with assumptions ( Lewis et al . 2004 ) , ambiguity and uncertainty . Consequently , the design team can avoid wasting time because of a limited understanding of the risks and opportunities related to the available knowledge . Early in 16 ( 35 ) the process , engineers are enabled to shape a clearer view of where mitigation efforts are needed so that action can be taken before it is too late in the process for corrective action . Knowledge Readiness Level ( KRL ) ( Chiaramonte and Joshi 2004 ) is a concept related to knowledge maturity , underlining the need to assess the level of readiness of the knowledge available in the team . In some cases , ensuring that the right people meet and collaborate , sharing what they know , is all that is needed , Conversely a fundamental research initiative might be needed at other times . Chiaramonte and Joshi ( 2004 ) argue that “…the cost of the “answer” is related to the KRL . Low KRL’s are relatively inexpensive , while high KRL’s require substantial research funding” ( p . 36 ) . Related to KRL , Research and Development Degree of Difficulty ( R & D 3 ) ( Mankins 2002 ) deals with estimating the difficulty expected in a certain development effort . A high R & D 3 value means that the company should have several parallel development efforts . Knowledge Maturity is based on the Technology Readiness Level ( TRL ) ( Mankins 1995 ) and Capability Maturity Model ( CMM ) ( Paulk et al . 1993 ) concepts . The TRL concept was developed by NASA to work as a framework to guide the development of technologies and systems to be used on space missions . Because the consequences of any failure can be extremely high , both in material and immaterial values , there is a need to ensure that any component or system being fitted onto a product going into space is properly and sufficiently tested and validated in environments relevant to the final mission . The TRL features a 9 - level criterion scale representing technologies in development from a research / laboratory state to a ‘flight proven’ implementation in a product . 17 ( 35 ) Figure 3 . Technology Readiness Level , from ( Nasa . gov ) . TRLs provide a common language between the technology developers , program office , and engineers who will adopt / use the technology . From this perspective , Graettinger et al ( 2002 ) argue that the TRL concept has a great value as something possibly associated to a boundary object or at least as an artefact , facilitating discussions between stakeholders . “… the greatest value from using TRLs comes from the discussions between the stakeholders that go into negotiating a TRL value . ” ( Graettinger et al . 2002 , p . 8 ) . The CMM and its derivate Capability Maturity Model Integrated ( CMMI ) ( CMMI Product Team 2001 ) are maturity concepts from software engineering . The Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon University ( SEI 2009 ) , on commission from the US Department of Defense ( DoD ) , developed these concepts as a way to measure and develop the capability of software companies’ development processes , and avoid costly delays and problems with software in the products that the DoD acquire ( Humphrey 18 ( 35 ) 1987 ) . CMM includes a maturity scale consisting of five levels , ranging from an initial , ad - hoc level to an optimising level at the top of the scale . The CMM concept comes with a number of key process areas that assist companies in their efforts to improve their processes . From a knowledge maturity perspective , the process focus of the CMM concept is interesting to build upon , since the process and its methods and tools for creating knowledge will reflect the end result . A mature and conscious process for developing the knowledge base should be more prone to develop knowledge of higher maturity compared to an immature , ad - hoc process . In relation to the CMM development , the SEI at Carnegie Mellon has also developed knowledge around supporting the people and teams working with software engineering process improvements . These concepts are called Personal Software Process ( PSP ) ( Humphrey 1995 ) and Team Software Process ( TSP ) ( Humphrey 2000 ) . The idea is to focus on the individuals , teams and process being targeted by the CMM initiative , see Figure 4 . Figure 4 . CMM related to TSP and PSP ( adopted from ( Humphrey 2000 ) ) . 19 ( 35 ) Drivers and Motives : the aerospace context The drivers and motives behind this paper and , to some extent , the limitations regarding generalisation of the results are related to the aerospace context and to this specific working environment . The aerospace industry differs significantly from many other industries ( e . g . automotive , metalworking tools , etcetera ) . The products ( airplanes , engines , components , etc . ) are relatively complex and require large investments to be developed compared to many other industries ( Acha et al . 2007 ) . The high purchasing price — e . g . the Airbus A380 is estimated to cost around $ 327 million ( Flightglobal . com 2008 ) — makes the business model slightly unconventional , where extensive subsidies are used and the main profits are made on the aftermarket activities , doing maintenance , repair and overhaul . In some cases , the discounts on an aero engine might be as much as 70 % ( Buxton et al . 2006 ) . Payback times can be very long , as much as 10 years ( Buxton et al . 2006 ) . Additionally , various product and service - bundled offerings ( i . e . product - service systems ( Mont 2002 ) ) where customers pay for the use of the product and only buy its function ( Alonso - Rasgado et al . 2004 ) , is becoming more and more popular , especially in the aero engine industry with Total Care agreements ( TotalCare 2009 ) as an example , thus distributing the customer’s expenditure over the lifecycle of the product . Given these challenges , companies will tend to team up in risk and revenue sharing partnerships to deal with time , investment and skill challenges ( Prencipe 2004 ) . Extended enterprises ( Boardman and Clegg 2001 , Browne and Zhang 1999 , Ericksen and Suri 2001 ) and virtual enterprises ( Browne and Zhang 1999 , Davidow and Malone 1993 , Hardwick and Bolton 1997 ) are examples of such partnerships , where the partners focus on their core competencies with which they create value and leave the rest to the other 20 ( 35 ) partners . A challenge of these partnerships is that the participating companies are often both collaborators and competitors , working in a mode of coopetition ( Brandenburger et al . 1995 ) . In these kinds of product development projects , the effort is highly collaborative in nature and contract - driven , i . e . before commitments are made and before the product development starts as a project , contracts are signed between the partners to regulate participation , responsibility and delivery , and thus oblige the companies to deliver on time to the other partners and to customers . This aspect greatly influences how product development and the stage - gate is approached in the aerospace context , as expressed by one of the respondents : “In our projects , we get an order from the customer over here [ author’s note : early in the stage - gate ] , so we have already sold what we are developing . ” Consequently , the company has to ensure that once the order comes and the contracts are signed , it will be able to deliver what is promised . Therefore , research and preliminary development activities are typically proceeding already before the contracts are signed to build competence and to mitigate this risk in the development phase . Before the contract is signed , homework is done to assess risks taken by signing on . When signing , they essentially chooses to take a certain risk , as one of the respondents puts it : “There is a breakpoint when you enter the contract . Before this breakpoint we do work to assess the risk that we take . Once the contract is signed and the project is launched , you have chosen to take a certain risk " Research activities , however , require relatively little capital investment and can also be targeted towards several development programs . Once in progress , they do not want to release the constraints in these contracts unless there is a substantial change to the terms of the projects or unless there is a risk for 21 ( 35 ) flight safety . Not fulfilling one’s own commitments is usually not a reason to break a contractual agreement . If a project is not viable , a breach of contract will mean fines and penalties . One of the respondents made it clear that although there are internal issues that are not clear enough to move forward - these are seldom a big enough reason to delay the project . There is simply not an option to delay the entire systems development initiative where the company’s portion is a part . Role of the stage - gate An earlier study ( Johansson et al . 2009 ) , found that the stage - gate process differs in Company A compared to theory ( Cooper 2001 , 2008 ) , mainly because the projects are rarely disbanded once they have started and they have received commitment . Contracts are actually signed very early in the process , requiring Company A to be very pragmatic in their decision making and prioritise completion of projects . Further , the company is tightly intertwined with its partners and is eager to be a good counterpart for collaborators and customers . As a consequence , in practice , contractual - based issues are often more important than individual gate criterion . Similarly in Company B , No - Go decisions merely occur in the very early stages when feasibility studies are conducted and the commitment is low . Onece up and running , the decision making approach at the gate is more pragmatic and does not follow the theoretical model described in literature , e . g . Cooper ( 2001 , 2008 ) . No - Go decisions are taken mainly when uncertainties relate to flight safety . Otherwise , companies deal with so - called ‘deviations’ , devise actions to solve them , and ultimately even changing the ‘flight envelope’ , resulting in restrictions in flight manuals . In practice , decision makers instead 22 ( 35 ) try to deal with issues that arise at the gate while moving ahead , opening the gate , instead of terminating or delaying an entire project , as shown also in the interview form from Company B . As one respondent puts it : “To identify where the risk is and deal with that risk [ … ] is more rational than to say ; ‘full stop , finish up before moving on’” What happens in reality is that the weaker areas are flagged yellow and an action plan is created with a time plan for completing and catching up the area in question . This is done in conjunction with the next development phase to not lose time in the project . This aspect is also found in other companies ( Christiansen and Varnes 2008 ) , which report that kill decisions are rare and that they make extensive use of what they call “conditional go” ( p . 92 ) decisions . Christiansen and Varnes ( 2008 ) also found that time is the most important criterion , more vital than any other criterion , since falling behind is not recommended . Similarly , as one respondent puts it : “From the beginning I think that the idea was that we were supposed to take ‘Go / No - Go’ decisions . But in the end nobody really believed it , since projects were never stopped . ” The stage - gate’s main benefit is not the ‘Go / No - Go’ decision logic , but rather a logic related to supporting development . Respondents see the stage - gate as a valuable tool to keep projects on the right track ( i . e . control purpose ) . The team can gather around it to discuss and visualise the status of the product and of the activities . At the gate , people have to present and defend their own views and answer for their choices by sharing information and knowledge with others . At the same time , they can challenge perceptions of others and advance the knowledge base . 23 ( 35 ) The role of the stage - gate was found to facilitate communication and discussion between the team members , gathering around it and relating their perception to it . As one respondent puts it : “This is the strength with the gated process . Allow things to mature for long enough , then bring it up and relate to it . ” For people with different perceptions of reality , the gate acts as a discussion trigger , obligating people to unveil their opinions and discussing why their views differ and what they can learn from it . As one respondent puts it , this aspect is something that they often need to deal with : “Even though you think that you have things under control , there are all sorts of things popping up , that you have to relate to and deal with . ” The stage - gate appears to have an important role in this context , facilitating communication to the stakeholders what the status of a project is and where more knowledge might be needed to continue and confidently move forward . The latter is crucial when dealing with strict contractual obligations , since aerospace partners need to see and know early in the development process if they are on track and if changes are needed , or as one respondent puts it : “… ( the ) gated process is so important to us , since we need to keep on track and not end up in a situation where we find out that the project is not profitable . ” Falling behind means coming under intense pressure from customers and partners ; therefore , the highest priority is to stay on track and not slow the project down . Analysing the findings from the study , the stage - gate resembles a boundary object ( Star and Griesemer 1989 ) that the team and other stakeholders can gather around , discuss and use to deal with issues in the project , and which assumes a similar role to a prototype or a model . The stage - gate is a common denominator that the stakeholders can 24 ( 35 ) use to visualise progress and communicate the status of the project , what is missing and what is needed . It synchronises people’s perception of progress being made , bringing people onto the same page . Similarly , Engwall ( 2005 ) concludes that the stage gate resembles a boundary object , because it mainly supports coordination , communication and sense giving ( Engwall et al . 2005 ) . From a knowledge perspective , boundary objects provide “a concrete means for individuals to specify and learn about their differences and dependencies across a given boundary . ” ( Carlile 2002 , p . 452 ) . It provides a means for people to specify what they know and what they are unsure about ( Carlile 2002 , Browne and Zhang 1999 ) , to the other team members . However , from a knowledge perspective , the concept of a stage - gate as a boundary object needs to be taken a step further . The negotiations between the engineers support learning about the product . For instance , a boundary object means different things to different people ( Larsson 2003 ) . Thus , the stage - gate is closer to the concept of boundary negotiating artefacts ( Lee 2007 ) , which deviates from the boundary object idea , since the artefacts are in a state of continuous change and reinterpretation , and the people dealing with them are pushing and renegotiating the boundaries . Basically , boundary negotiating artefacts support the team members in questioning the conception of a project and question the knowledge they believe to possess . This kind of conflict is an important basis for new knowledge creation , since people , synthesising their beliefs and questioning what they see , they can create new knowledge . The stage gate process , therefore , plays a more refined and deep role in the design activity and should be not merely considered a means to support communication between the team members . 25 ( 35 ) However , this communicative and negotiating function of the stage - gate is often implicit and dependent on participating individual’s ability to reflect on the status and quality of the available knowledge assets . The boundary negotiating artefact ( Lee 2007 ) is not merely a physical exhibition of the knowledge , but rather a way of challenging and questioning what the design team thinks to know . In such a context , the knowledge maturity concept represents a means to discuss the learning that takes place at the gate , challenging the team’s confidence on the knowledge supporting the decision making activity , thus acting as a boundary object that facilitates the team in dealing with the knowledge dimension . The use of the knowledge maturity concept as a boundary object strengthens the role of the stage - gate as an artefact supporting the negotiation of the boundaries between team members . The narrative knowledge maturity scale , see Table 1 below , is therefore an interesting concept to explore and thus support the boundary negotiation activity , by allowing them to focus on the knowledge as well as uncertainties and ambiguities . This scale , influenced theoretically from the TRL and CMM concepts , and developed and validated in workshops with industry experts , is intended as a structured way of supporting the knowledge creation process by generating small , constructive conflicts among the team members as a means to raise the perception on the knowledge possessed by the team , and force people to stop and reflect on what they really know . 26 ( 35 ) Table 1 . Generic narrative criteria scale for knowledge maturity concept ( adopted from ( Johansson et al . 2008 ) ) . 5 Excellent • The content and rationale are tested and proven . It reflects a known confidence regarding , for instance , risks . • The procedure to produce the content and rationale reflects an approach where validated methods are used and where workers continually reflect and improve . • Lessons learnt are recorded . 4 Good 3 Acceptable • The content and rationale are more standardized and defined ( i . e . documented and formalised ) . • There is a greater extent of detailing and definition . • The procedure to produce the content and rationale is more stable ( compared to previous levels ) with an element of standardization and repeatability . 2 Dubious 1 Inferior • Content and rationale are characterized by instability ( e . g . poor / no understanding of knowledge base ) . • The procedure to produce the content and rationale is dependant on individuals and formalized methods are non - existent . A closer look shows that the stage - gate is intended to support the knowledge creation through the intermediary states , from immature to mature knowledge , of the product . Hence it can also be considered as an intermediary object ( Boujut and Blanco 2003 ) , since it essentially conceptualises the boundary objects and any artefacts as intermediary states of a product . Similarly , Engwall ( 2003 ) highlights the need for supporting such a knowledge journey in the context of the stage - gate , where a pragmatic and less rigid instantiation of the gate better supports learning about the product . Here , the knowledge maturity approach is a valuable tool to highlight the knowledge status , what the team really knows — or does not know — and what it needs to know , thus supporting this knowledge creation and knowledge journey , from immature through intermediary stages to a mature state of knowledge . The continuous reflection triggered by the method is an important ingredient when learning about the product and gaining knowledge about why solutions are the way they are . Engineers are requested to relate their individual understanding to the bigger 27 ( 35 ) picture and check where they are in relation to where they are supposed to be and in relation to the perception of others . Unrelated specifically to the knowledge maturity concept , one of the respondents highlights the importance of reflecting about their position in relation to the goals : “You reflect over where you are and what you are doing , instead of just keeping on working and running your head into the wall . ” The method aims to bring everyone onto the same playing field when dealing with information , knowledge and objectives in the stage - gate process , while forcing the team to reflect on issues such as ’What do we know about the product , process , market , etc . ? ’ ’What do we not know ? ’ and ’What do we need to know ? ’ . Also related to decision making , considered the main objective of the stage - gate , the boundary object is a way of dealing with uncertainty , with ‘wickedness’ ( Rittel and Webber 1973 ) and the ‘ill - defined’ ( Cross 1982 ) nature of problems . As Christiansen and Varnes ( 2006 ) highlight , stage - gate is supposed to be about making rational decisions . However , from the actions that are devised in company A , the practical instantiation of the gate obviously does not support the rational approach to decision making that Cooper ( 2008 ) advocates , which agrees with Simon’s ( 1955 , 1979 ) thoughts about rational decision making not existing in practice . Christiansen and Varnes ( 2008 ) have identified a similar tendency , referring to a concept of appropriate decision making ( March et al . 2001 ) : “Decision making thus becomes more a matter of making appropriate decisions than of optimal or rational decision making . ” ( Christiansen and Varnes 2008 , p . 87 ) . This concept builds on a logic of appropriateness as opposed to a logic of consequence , which the rational paradigm of decision making advocates ( Cyert and March 1992 ) . The pragmatic approach found in practice can be compared to bounded rationality ( Simon 1955 , 1979 ) . 28 ( 35 ) In a state of bounded rationality , access to information is limited , which basically makes rational decision making impossible , since it is not possible to evaluate all alternatives ( Simon 1979 ) . “Of course the solution , though it provides optimal decisions for the simplified world of our assumptions , provides , at best , satisfactory solutions for the real - world decision problem that the quadratic function approximates . In - principle , unattainable optimization is sacrificed for in - practice , attainable satisfaction . ” ( Ibid . , p . 499 ) . As noted earlier , a concept that is closely related to bounded rationality and wicked problems is satisficing ( Simon 1955 ) , i . e . decision makers have to make a trade - off between the optimal and the sufficient , being forced to select an option that is basically good enough . This is closely related to the way decision making is done at Company A , as in virtually any decision making situation to varying degrees , where decisions have to be made , gates have to be cleared and the next stage must begin to keep up with the partners . The action plans are then devised to deal with what is not yet considered good enough . This is naturally an area for concern , since these decisions need to be made , even though the team might not be 100 % confident about the status of the knowledge base influencing the decisions . Although the numbers may be right , the knowledge behind them is occasionally based on assumptions rather than real facts . Without knowing the real characteristics of the knowledge used at the gate , the decision makers are challenged to make decisions despite these uncertainties . In this context , the knowledge maturity approach can play an important role in making the team aware that everything is unlikely to be known at the gate . The knowledge maturity approach can signal imprecision , provisional information and support the team in dealing with the ambiguity in the process ( Stacey and Eckert 2003 ) , where the acceptance level is normally adjusted to let things through . 29 ( 35 ) It has to be noted , however , that ambiguity is recognized to represent both a drawback and an opportunity for the design team ( Stacey and Eckert 2003 ) , especially when making decisions at the gates . Decisions are sometimes made even though it is hard to judge whether the foundation reflects verified knowledge or weak assumptions , i . e . the quality of information is assumed good . On a related note , Stacey and Eckert ( 2003 ) state that “communicating imprecise , uncertain and provisional ideas is a vital part of design teamwork , but what is uncertain and provisional needs to be expressed as clearly as possible . ” ( p . 153 ) , highlighting the need to accept that ambiguity and assumptions exist in any development process , and that this needs to be managed more effectively . Assumption management is a concept that is found in software engineering ( Lewis et al . 2004 ) , since an assumption in one part of a code can quickly have wide - spread consequences . Some artefacts can be misleading because they fail to convey information about uncertainty and ambiguity ( Stacey and Eckert 2003 ) . Therefore , there is a need for what Stacey and Eckert ( 2003 ) call ‘meta - notations’ to convey these aspects . The knowledge maturity concept can be seen as a way of making such ‘meta - notations’ , allowing design teams to make decisions with a higher level of confidence , because it renders the quality of the knowledge base clearer to all the stakeholders in the activity . Different situations will certainly make different use of this kind of approach , and thus experience different levels of benefits from using it . Relating to the Mintzberg et al ( 1976 ) model , with three main steps for decision making ; identification , development , and selection , the use of the knowledge maturity approach seems to provide a greater benefit when discussing ambiguous and uncertain matters in the earlier steps of the decision making model . In addition , experienced participants and novices might also find 30 ( 35 ) the knowledge maturity support useful to different degrees , where people with experience might know better how to navigate around uncertainty and ambiguity , whereas novices might find a structured support useful , helping them deal with the unawareness and reach confidence from knowing the unknowns . It should be noted that the main purpose of the gate is still to make decisions , albeit not focusing specifically on kill decisions in this context . The boundary object dimension offers a supplementary way of approaching the stage - gate , beyond that of merely making a choice between two or more alternatives . Supporting the stage - gate process with a knowledge maturity approach has the potential of facilitating the communication leading up to a decision , enabling stakeholders to become aware of how their peers perceive and evaluate the risks and rewards related to the knowledge assets presented and communicated at the gate . Concluding remarks The purpose of this paper has been to investigate the role of the stage - gate process at the aerospace case company and gain a deeper understanding of how the gated process and the decision making practices relate to ambiguity and uncertainty . The stage - gate process has been found to have a different role in this study compared to what is prescribed by Cooper ( 2001 , 2008 ) in theory . In practice , in the aerospace context , the kill decision that is advocated by Cooper , appears to be very rare , if not missing altogether , when the product development is in a mature phase . What normally happens , if the decision does not relate to flight safety , is that the area is flagged yellow , and an action plan for catching up is devised . The main reason for this can be attributed to that the development in the industry is contract - driven , meaning that 31 ( 35 ) contracts are signed before any commitment to develop a product is assigned . Breaching these contracts is , naturally , something that the manufacturers want to avoid , hence the pragmatic role of decision making in the stag - gate . Therefore , they try to identify risks as best as possible , and move forward , dealing with these risks . This is where the true benefit of the stage - gate for the companies is visible . It provides a common denominator that they can use to bring things up on the table , communicate and visualise their progress , and make sense of the knowledge base to manage open issues . In the analysis of the results of this paper , the role of the stage - gate process as what can be likened to a boundary object has been highlighted , facilitating communication , discussion and knowledge sharing as well as highlighting where additional knowledge is needed , to deal with ambiguities and uncertainties to raise confidence in decisions . The concept of the boundary object as well as the boundary negotiating artefact is a way to theoretically represent the activity that goes on in the gates , where team members have to bring their perception of the knowledge base on the table and defend their perceptions to the challenges posed by others , thus negotiating the boundaries of people’s perceptions of the knowledge base . This process can be supported further by the knowledge maturity concept , where the team members will have a boundary object that is directly aimed at dealing with the ambiguities and uncertainties , by focusing specifically on the knowledge base . So what does this mean then , practically ? Dealing with ambiguity and uncertainty means that the team are in a state of bounded rationality , having to make satisficing decisions , settling for what is ‘good enough’ , as opposed to the optimal decision . The knowledge maturity concept is not a silver bullet that will erase the existence of the 32 ( 35 ) pragmatic decision making that was found in the study . However , with a better support for dealing directly with ambiguity and uncertainty , and the knowledge base in general means that the team has a means to look beyond the face value of the documents in the gate reviews . This enables team members to share knowledge and also to generate new knowledge , both by devising new knowledge creation through actions and by synthesising their current knowledge assets . By raising the decision maker’s awareness concerning knowledge maturity , they can more confidently devise actions to seek complementary information , knowledge and expertise in areas where there is a perceived high level of ambiguity and uncertainty .

Larsson 1 and Marco Bertoni 1 1 Division of Functional Product Development , Luleå University of Technology , Luleå Sweden 2 Bath University , Bath , United Kingdom Abstract : Streamlining new product development processes forces companies to make decisions on preliminary information and assumptions . It is important to understand and deal with such ambiguities and uncertainties , especially when dealing with product - service systems with hardware and services combined . This paper explores a practical decision support to increase decision makers’ awareness of the knowledge base when making decisions , where cross - boundary discussions on the perceived maturity of available knowledge assets need to be supported , ensuring that limitations can be identified and mitigated . Requirements are elicited from previous research on knowledge maturity and a knowledge maturity model is developed in five industry - based workshops . Keywords : Knowledge Management , New Product Development , Stage - Gate , Aerospace , Product - Service System Introduction To stay ahead of the competition in an increasingly global marketplace , product - developing companies need to continuously improve both what they offer to the market and the processes by which they produce such offers . Since the research and development ( R & D ) process requires capital investment , which cannot be returned until the products reach the market , one priority is to make the product development process more effective and efficient , to reduce lead - time and cost without sacrificing quality . This means that the decision making process , typically structured according to a stage - gate ( Cooper , 2001 , 2008 ) format , with stages and gates , where information and knowledge are prepared in the stages for decisions to be taken in the gates , needs to be rationalized . For many capital - intensive products , such as aerospace products , the break - even point , when product sales generate enough profit to cover the initial product development investment , can lie several years into the life cycle of the product ( Buxton , Farr , and C . Johansson , B . Hicks , A . Larsson , M . Bertoni MacCarthy , 2006 ) . A key challenge when shortening development cycles is that the same amount of decisions needs to be made , only in a much shorter time frame – without decreasing quality . Alternative viewpoints on how to meet this challenge include being able to make the right decision directly to avoid costly iterations , or to fail early and often to succeed sooner ( Kelley , 2001 , Schrage , 2000 , Thomke , 2001 ) . Regardless of the view taken , the continuous streamlining of product development processes forces companies to make decisions based , to a higher degree than before , on preliminary information and assumptions rather than on established facts . While acknowledging that product development and innovation will always be an exploratory activity laden with ambiguity and uncertainty ( Bucciarelli , 1994 , Stacey and Eckert , 2003 ) , it has become more important than ever to efficiently and explicitly identify and understand such ambiguities and uncertainties during the development process ( Stacey and Eckert , 2003 ) . The sources of uncertainty can be many including ; considerations related to technology ( e . g . will it perform as expected ? ) , production ( e . g . can it be effectively produced ? ) , user needs ( e . g . do the customers perceive it as valuable ? ) , and market conditions ( e . g . is the market large enough to justify the investment ? ) ( Thomke , 2003 ) . Aside from uncertainties that the development teams are aware of , but might not have answers to , there are also implicit assumptions and ingrained views that might pose significant risks if not attended to carefully . For example , Thomke ( 1998 , 2001 ) reported on how car manufacturer BMW’s engineers assumed that the stronger the area next to the base of a car’s pillars ( the structures connecting the roof to the chassis ) , the better the car would perform in the event of a crash . However , they later found that strengthening that particular area would actually decrease the crashworthiness of the vehicle , and that the safer option was to weaken , not strengthen , the area . Product - Service Systems ( PSS ) In the context of PSS ( Mont , 2002 ) and total offers ( Alonso - Rasgado , Thompson , and Elfström , 2004 ) , being an integration of hardware and service , developed simultaneously in an integrated approach ( Tukker and Tischner , 2004 ) , many diverse knowledge areas ( e . g . engineering design , manufacturing , business development , etc . ) need to be more closely integrated . As a consequence , no one team or individual can integrate such knowledge and the integrated development teams ( Ulrich and Eppinger , 2008 ) are heavily dependent upon developing and maintaining a shared understanding . In addition , the total offer concept means that the manufacturer is the owner ( compared to the customer with a traditional product ) for the full duration of the PSS lifecycle ( Tukker and Tischner , 2004 ) from the first idea to when it is recycled , and the customers buy the function that the product - service system provides when they require it . Therefore , all the risk related to maintenance and availability of the ”product” lies with the manufacturer ( Alonso - Rasgado , Thompson , and Elfström , 2004 ) adding an incentive for developers and providers to explore ways of designing the product as efficiently as possible from a life cycle perspective ( Williams , 2006 ) , to maximize the profit and value that can be drawn from it . As part of a PSS , the hardware goes from being a value adding artefact to something that primarily incurs cost and expenditure for the manufacturer ( Williams , 2007 ) . To manage this , the manufacturer and its partners need to bring as much “downstream” knowledge as possible to the early phases of product development . For instance , such downstream knowledge could relate to in - use behaviour , expected maintenance cycles , or recycling considerations . What are the weaknesses in the knowledge base when taking a full life cycle perspective ? What do they not know well enough to make confident decisions about life cycle parameters ? What are their assumptions , and under which circumstances can those assumptions be trusted ? These Development of Knowledge Maturity Scales to Support PSS Development in the Aerospace Sector aspects are filled with inherent uncertainty and ambiguity , as knowing about this is largely about knowing what is unknown . Key questions include : How many people actually know the unknown parameters and values related to the decision to be made , and how can they advance their understanding before making a decision ? A major concern in PSS development is that such development efforts normally begin with relatively little shared understanding with respect to the many disciplines and functions involved in the development process . While ”traditional” product development is also highly integrated and cross - functional , the total life cycle perspective and the integration of hardware and services inherent in product - service system development further intensifies the challenge of bridging a wide diversity of data , information and knowledge coming from all parts of the value chain ( Nergård et al . , 2006 ) . In the process of developing a product or service , it is considered most advantageous to make changes in the early stages , when relatively little capital is committed . However , the ”design process paradox” by Ullman ( 2003 ) highlights that “ the more you learn the less freedom you have to use what you know ” ( ibid . , p . 18 ) . This means that development teams are in the unfortunate situation of having limited knowledge in the early stages , when they have good opportunities to influence the design , whereas when they have established a more developed knowledge base in the later stages , major decisions have already been made , capital has already been committed , and it is therefore more costly and time - consuming to make changes . With assumptions and uncertainties abounding about the status of technical and process knowledge , regarding where to go next and why , companies need to deploy several complementary ( Mankins , 1998 , 2002 ) strategies and approaches to deal with such uncertainties . There are a range of strategies and approaches in companies aimed at supporting decision making on the development of new technologies , e . g . Technology Readiness Level ( TRL ) ( Mankins , 1995 ) among others . However , while these approaches can also be suitable in a PSS context , the complexity of the total offers implies that companies not only need to assess the readiness of technological components , but also need to develop a shared understanding from a wide set of disciplinary concerns and perspectives , and assess how each piece of information or knowledge contributes to the knowledge base used to make decisions . Further , there is a need to provide decision makers with a deeper understanding of the status of the knowledge base , to help them deal with the uncertainty and ambiguity of the decision base , thus providing increased confidence for decision makers . This paper explores practical decision support for PSS development aiming to increase decision makers’ awareness and understanding regarding the current status of the knowledge base they draw upon when making decisions . In particular , cross - boundary discussions focused on the perceived maturity of available knowledge assets need to be supported , ensuring that any potential risks related to limitations in the knowledge base are identified and mitigated . The purpose of this paper is to revisit previous exploratory and descriptive research on knowledge maturity and to propose a framework for how stakeholders in the stage - gate process can use the concept of knowledge maturity to more effectively deal with uncertainty and ambiguity in the stage - gate process . C . Johansson , B . Hicks , A . Larsson , M . Bertoni Research Approach For the purpose of this research the design research methodology framework ( DRM ) ( Blessing and Chakrabarti , 2002 ) is adopted . The DRM framework ( see Figure 1 ) consists of four main phases : ( 1 ) research clarification , ( 2 ) descriptive study I , ( 3 ) prescriptive study , and ( 4 ) descriptive study II . The aim is to support and guide the research effort from initial ideas of a research problem to a tested and evaluated support in a systematic way . Previous work on knowledge maturity as a decision support for stage - gate processes has mainly been undertaken in the research clarification and descriptive study I phases ( Ericson et al . , 2007 , Johansson , 2009 , Johansson et al . , 2008 , Johansson , Parida , and Larsson , 2009 ) , exploring the problem area and providing a description of the challenge . In contrast to these previous studies , this paper deals with the prescriptive study with an attempt to devise a support tool for the situation discovered in the previous phases . Based on the analysis of the problem situation and on other developments in the area ( e . g . TRL , etc . ) ; by attending to the quality and maturity of knowledge it reports on the development of a set of knowledge maturity scales to support decision making in stage - gate processes . The aim is to increase the confidence for decision makers working in the stage - gate process , since they will be provided with a better understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the knowledge base by which they make decisions . Figure 1 - Design Research Methodology ( adapted from Blessing and Chakrabarti , 2009 ) . Motivation The main motivation for the development of the knowledge maturity scales comes from the increasing need for aerospace industries to further make the product development process more efficient through cost and time savings . This was also the main target of VIVACE ( Value Improvement through a Virtual Aeronautical Collaborative Enterprise ) ( VIVACE , 2007 ) , an integrated project within the European Union’s ( EU’s ) sixth framework programme ( FP6 ) . The VIVACE goals stem from the ACARE ( Advisory Council for Aeronautics Research in Europe ) ( ACARE , 2009 ) targets , outlined in the Strategic Research Agenda ( SRA , 2002 ) , developed under the initiative of the European Commission ( EC ) . The ACARE group consists of members from the EC , EU member states , and aerospace stakeholders ( i . e . airlines , manufacturers , academia , etc . ) , with the aim to develop the SRA , which is intended to guide development efforts in the aerospace Development of Knowledge Maturity Scales to Support PSS Development in the Aerospace Sector domain to create a competitive industrial sector in the EU , able to compete on equal terms mainly with their American counterpart . Specifically , the targets of VIVACE ( VIVACE , 2007 ) were to achieve cost and lead - time savings both in development of aircraft ( 5 % cost and lead - time reduction ) and engine ( 30 % lead - time reduction and 50 % cost reduction ) development . These targets were to be achieved through deployment of numerous advanced capabilities to deal with challenges and problems elicited in the partner companies’ processes during the project . One of those capabilities was Knowledge Enabled Engineering , being able to provide the engineers working in the processes with the right knowledge , at the right time . One of the challenges elicited was the 7 Day Proposal ( 7DP ) use case ( originally reported in a VIVACE technical report by Bovik ( 2006 ) ) as part of the Extended Jet Engine Enterprise Scenario work package , forecasting future business scenarios and business models . The 7 Day Proposal ( 7DP ) The main purpose of the 7DP was to develop a customized value proposal for e . g . a PSS in a virtual enterprise within 7 days , thus managing a wide range of aspects in a very short time frame , while still minimizing or at least having a good awareness of the ambiguities and uncertainties in the decision material produced for the gates . As a reference , the current nominal time period for such an activity is somewhere from six weeks to many months , with peaks of several years . Shortening this phase would allow companies to anticipate competitors in the market as well as reducing the time between proposal and sale , thus speeding up the return on investment timetable and increasing competitiveness in the global marketplace . One of the main drivers behind aiming for the kind of extensive reduction in lead - time that the 7DP represent , was to force radical changes to how things are done in practice . With a 7 - day timeframe , it is virtually impossible to do things the same way as previously . For instance , the virtual enterprise partners have to be better prepared managing ambiguity and uncertainty in the decision base , making decisions on immature and sometimes unproven information and knowledge , but still maintaining confidence or at least understanding the level of confidence in the decision base and the decisions that need to be taken . The core of the 7DP work was a definition of the process to develop a proposal in a stage - gate format ( see Figure 2 ) as well as a set of definitions of support tools and methods ( i . e . advanced capabilities ) needed to support the development . C . Johansson , B . Hicks , A . Larsson , M . Bertoni Figure 2 - 7DP process with stage and gate structure ( adapted from Bovik , 2006 ) . Knowledge Support for the 7 Day Proposal The knowledge maturity concept was perceived as an advanced capability to support the knowledge intensive 7DP process , where PSS necessitates sharing of large quantities of data and information between partners , as well as efficiently dealing with ambiguity and uncertainty due to the limited amount of time available to both identify relevant knowledge assets and to assess their maturity and readiness with respect to the needs and objectives identified in the 7DP process . The development of the framework is underpinned by the needs of the 7DP process as well as data collected in previous exploratory and descriptive studies ( Ericson et al . , 2007 , Johansson , 2009 , Johansson et al . , 2008 , Johansson , Parida , and Larsson , 2009 ) , where a synthesis of this data has formed an input to a set of requirements for knowledge maturity assessment . To elicit the needs of the 7DP a research effort preceded the development of the knowledge maturity scale , spending about 18 months in the VIVACE project with partners from Europe’s aerospace industry with Original Equipment Manufacturers ( OEMs ) , tier 1 suppliers , and risk and revenue sharing partners as well as research institutions taking part . This was then refined through a series of workshops with one of the partner companies , where knowledge support for the 7DP Process was identified as one of the key enablers . The process involved five workshops ( see Table 1 ) with up to eight participants , loosely following a future workshop approach ( Kensing and Madsen , 1991 ) , where participants from the working contexts that are the subject of the workshop take part to , in three steps : ( 1 ) criticize and problematize the current situation , ( 2 ) wish for a future scenario that solves the current problem , and ( 3 ) assist in the development of the future solution . Here the main focus was to elicit the participants’ expertise of their Development of Knowledge Maturity Scales to Support PSS Development in the Aerospace Sector work contexts to develop general knowledge maturity scales as well as to learn of their contexts to find what is the Utopian situation for them in a decision making situation , and conversely what is the worst situation they can think of . This served as input to the knowledge maturity scales , together with established theories from related developments found in literature . The focus of each workshop and the outputs are described in Table 1 . Table 1 - Methodology for development of the knowledge maturity scale . Workshop # No . Participants Company ( s ) ?

To handle the paradox of doing more with less , decision makers need to improve their understanding of the ”fitness - for - purpose” of a piece of information or knowledge , to make sure that the decision making process is guided by well - founded ideas , principles , theories , insights , and so on . In this C . Johansson , B . Hicks , A . Larsson , M . Bertoni context , ”better decisions” does not automatically result in ”better results” , but is rather a way of ensuring that decisions are taken with appropriate consideration of the maturity or readiness in relation to the decision making objectives , i . e . that companies can choose to move forward with ”known risk” as the result of a voluntary , conscious choice , rather than moving forward with unknown risk through an implicit , unconscious choice . In many situations , the end result of a conscious decision and an unconscious decision might be identical , but when it comes to successfully capturing and tracing decision rationale throughout a project , such an assessment can be of crucial importance ( Bracewell , Ahmed , and Wallace , 2004 , McAlpine et al . , 2006 ) . To further contextualize the importance of assessing knowledge maturity in product development projects , the forthcoming sections will highlight key aspects related to the role of knowledge maturity in stage - gate decision making processes . Decision Making Mintzberg , Raisinghani , and Théorêt ( 1976 ) define a decision as a specific commitment to action . Further , they define the decision process as the “ set of actions and dynamic factors that begins with the identification of a stimulus for action and ends with the specific commitment to actions ” ( Mintzberg , Raisinghani , and Théorêt , 1976 , p . 246 ) . Rational decision making is related to rational choice theory ( Scott , 2000 ) , which is based on the idea that all action is rational and that actors calculate the costs and benefits of everything they do beforehand . Rational decision making is based on four aspects ( March , 1999 ) : knowledge of alternatives , knowledge of consequences of alternative actions , consistent preference ordering , and a decision rule by which to select a single alternative of action . Similarly , according to Simon ( 1979 ) , rational decision making : “…calls for knowledge of all the alternatives that are open to choice . It calls for complete knowledge of , or ability to compute , the consequences that will follow on each of the alternatives . It calls for certainty in the decision maker ' s present and future evaluation of these consequences . It calls for the ability to compare consequences , no matter how diverse and heterogeneous , in terms of some consistent measure of utility . ” ( Simon , 1979 , p . 500 ) However , rational decision making is a rare occurrence ( Simon , 1979 ) . Many problems in product development are intrinsically ”wicked” ( Rittel and Webber , 1973 ) or ”ill - defined” ( Cross , 1982 ) , because it is virtually impossible to know everything about all alternatives : “ there are no true or false answers . [ … ] solutions are expressed as ’good‘ or ’bad‘ or , more likely , as ’better or worse‘ or ’satisfying‘ or ’good enough . ’ ” ( Rittel and Webber , 1973 , p . 163 ) . Making a decision is often about settling for what is good enough rather than waiting for the optimal solution to emerge , which means that the decision makers need to approach the situation knowing whether or not the decision is based on flawed information ( e . g . placeholder values ( Flanagan , Eckert , and Clarkson , 2007 ) , uncertain information about competitors ( Rosenzweig , 2007 ) , assumptions ( ibid . ) , missing information ( ibid . ) , etc . ) , coming back to the limited degree of completeness , trustworthiness or accuracy ( Darlington et al . , 2009 ) . Raising the awareness of what such flaws entail is a first step on the way to a solution of this issue . Simon ( 1979 ) talks about bounded rationality , which arises when not all alternatives are known , when external factors cannot be managed , or when consequences cannot be Development of Knowledge Maturity Scales to Support PSS Development in the Aerospace Sector calculated ( Simon , 1979 ) , essentially when decision making is not fully rational . ”Satisficing” , a portmanteau of ”satisfying” and ”sufficing” , is an important word in this context , describing the selection of something that is good enough ( Simon , 1979 ) . Mintzberg , Raisinghani , and Théorêt ( 1976 ) have developed a three - step model for decision making consisting of the stages of identification , development , and selection ( Mintzberg , Raisinghani , and Théorêt , 1976 ) . The identification phase consists of decision recognition and diagnosis . The development phase is both about searching for existing solutions and designing customized solutions . Finally , the selection phase has three sub - steps : screen , evaluation - choice , and authorization , to narrow down the alternatives , evaluating the final ones , selecting and then making sure that the decision is supported by management . Stage - Gate Stage - gate , developed by Cooper ( 2001 ) , is a process that facilitates projects from idea to launch of a product . The process can be seen as a set of information - gathering activities or phases ( Cooper , 2008 ) , with evaluation and decision points at intervals between the phases . The overall process map is shown in Figure 3 below . Figure 3 - Stage - gate process overview ( from Cooper , 2008 ) . The key components of the stage - gate process are the ”stage” , where activities take place , and the ”gate” , where information is assessed and decisions are made , see Figure 4 . Figure 4 - Stage - gate structure with a stage followed by a gate ( from Cooper , 2008 ) . C . Johansson , B . Hicks , A . Larsson , M . Bertoni Each stage can be seen as an information and knowledge gathering activity that , after analysis and deliberation by the project team , produce deliverables as input to the gate ( Cooper , 2008 ) , see Figure 4 . As identified in previous research ( Johansson , 2009 , Johansson , Parida , and Larsson , 2009 ) , the deliverables brought to the gate meetings include summary documents , criteria documents , design rationale documents , technical reports , analysis results , test reports as well as the tacit knowledge of the people performing the work . It is important to note here that even though the decision makers may have many complementary sources to use in the decision making process , a crucial challenge is how to assess these knowledge sources and knowledge assets with respect to their fitness - for - purpose . What is the level of readiness of the presented information ? Is it reflecting assumptions or verified facts ? Is there anything missing ? Is the information current or out of date ? Are there specific knowledge assets that would need further development to contribute more clearly to the objective ? Is there a need to prioritize refinement of some aspects over others ? Also , it is important to assess how well these pieces of information and knowledge work in harmony with each other , i . e . how does the tacit knowledge complement ( or perhaps challenge ) the formal documentation ? Is there an alignment in the knowledge base , or does the gut feeling of the participants contradict the formal data ? In these situations , there is a degree of uncertainty that needs to be handled , perhaps not by directly focusing on reducing the uncertainty , but rather by assisting the decision makers in achieving a better understanding of what those uncertainties , ambiguities , and assumptions actually involve . Within each stage , activities are normally undertaken in parallel . The role of the gate is to evaluate what was done in the previous stage and to decide the way forward , what should be done in the next stage , how that path forward should be undertaken and the resources to be allocated for the next stage ( Cooper , 2008 ) . Reviewers evaluate the information , or the deliverables , developed during the stage . This information is matched against a number of criteria to make a decision . According to Cooper ( 2001 ) , the reviewers have four options to choose from . The first option is ”Go” , when the project is in good health and can keep going into the next stage . Resources are then allocated for continued work . The opposite of this is ”Kill” , when the work has not progressed as expected and moving further presents a major risk . The project is thus terminated . In the middle is either the option to ”Hold” or to ”Recycle” , i . e . providing certain changes are made , the project can still go on – with or without a delay depending on the nature of the required changes . The main functionality of the stage - gate process is decision making ( Christiansen and Varnes , 2006 ) . Christiansen and Varnes ( 2006 ) also propose that decision making in the stage - gate prescribes the use of rational choice theory to facilitate arriving at the right decision , essentially whether to go ahead , rework , or kill a project . Knowledge Maturity Maturity is defined by Grebici et al . ( 2007 ) as “ a compromise between the target uncertainty and the expected uncertainty . ” ( ibid . p . 282 ) , denoting maturity as the distance between the level of completeness relative to what should be the level of completeness , i . e . as - is status versus to - be status . Information maturity is thus the relative state of the development of a piece of information with respect to achieving a purpose , which implies that a piece of information may be mature for one purpose and immature for another . For Development of Knowledge Maturity Scales to Support PSS Development in the Aerospace Sector example , a preliminary analysis result concerning the heat tolerance of an aero engine component may be good enough in the feasibility stage of designing the component , whereas the same numbers may be too inaccurate to be of value in the detail design stage . Bohn ( 1994 ) defines maturity of knowledge as “ understanding the effects of the input variables on the output ” ( ibid . , p . 63 ) . He further states that : “ The manager ' s or process engineer ' s goal is to manipulate the raw materials , controls and environment to get output that is as good as possible . It is customary to treat the environmental variables as exogenous and uncontrollable . However , with enough knowledge , the environmental variables can be turned into control variables and , therefore , are not exogenous ” ( ibid . p . 63 ) The knowledge maturity concept builds on the assertion that everything cannot be known – some things are known , while other things are not . As noted above , some variables are exogenous and uncontrollable , and others can be controlled . In PSS development , and in particular of the innovative kind , there are many environmental and contextual variables , with varying degrees of controllability . While it would not be feasible to create innovative PSS , and at the same time completely eliminate uncertainty and ambiguity , companies would most likely benefit from learning more about what exactly those uncertainties and ambiguities involve . The same amount of decisions have to be made earlier in the process , but information and knowledge that can help guide such decisions is often in limited supply or based on preliminary findings and even vague assumptions . Johansson et al ( 2008 ) build upon the concept of knowledge maturity to create a measure of maturity , where the state of readiness of a knowledge asset is assessed using a narrative scale , highlighting how ”fit - for - purpose” a piece of information or knowledge is with regard to the objectives brought forward in , for example , a stage - gate review meeting . The basic idea behind the knowledge maturity model is to represent information and knowledge over three dimensions : input , method ( tool ) , and expertise ( experience ) . This enables an assessment of the input data , the tool to refine or develop the input into an output , and the individuals contributing to the work , and allows teams to have a shared artefact around which they can identify and discuss issues of concern , visualize the current status of the knowledge base , and negotiate a shared understanding of the advantages and drawbacks with the available knowledge base . In turn , this will enable them to take action on improving the knowledge assets that are not yet perceived to be fit - for - purpose . Teams can thus reason about their collective knowledge , or lack thereof , in a similar manner as they usually do with aspects related to technical performance ( i . e . technology readiness ( Hicks et al . , 2009 , Mankins , 1995 ) . Requirements for Knowledge Maturity Assessment When designing a supportive approach for assessing knowledge maturity within the context of decision making in the stage - gate process , a set of features and considerations can be elicited from previous work . These include dealing with a diverse set of product and service parameters ( Ericson et al . , 2007 ) , dealing with ambiguity and uncertainty , as well as being able to take conditional go - decisions in the stage - gate even though knowledge and information is immature or even incomplete ( Johansson , 2009 , Johansson , Parida , and Larsson , 2009 ) . Also , the development of other maturity based C . Johansson , B . Hicks , A . Larsson , M . Bertoni tools relating to , for instance , technology readiness levels ( Hicks et al . , 2009 , Johansson et al . , 2008 ) , need to be taken into consideration . When dealing with the design of PSS , while being under pressure to keep up with tight schedules in a highly distributed and diverse virtual enterprise , we have identified seven fundamental requirements related to knowledge maturity assessment . The requirements are summarized in Table 2 at the end of this section . Support for Boundary Negotiation The stage - gate process was found to fill a role of establishing as well as negotiating the boundaries that relate to people’s potentially different perceptions of the available knowledge , thus facilitating collaboration and knowledge sharing ( Johansson , 2009 ) . Using the stage - gate as a boundary object , they can challenge each other’s perception of the knowledge base and synthesize what they know , thus creating new knowledge ( ibid . ) . The knowledge maturity approach needs to support this boundary negotiating activity and enable the collective shaping of knowledge , allowing team members to share and challenge each other’s perceptions of the maturity of the proposed decision base . Support for Tacit Knowledge Sharing Making decisions related to total offers and product - service systems ( Ericson et al . , 2007 ) means that the decision makers must take account of numerous aspects that they have limited knowledge about , and which they would have difficulties turning into a formal ( explicit ) ( Polanyi , 1967 ) basis for decisions for the purpose of a gate review meeting . In the early stages of product development projects , the relative importance of gut feeling , or intuition , were seen as having a greater influence on decision making ( Ericson et al . , 2007 ) , because more formal decision materials , such as blueprints , virtual models , and bills of material are often not developed at this stage ( Ericson et al . , 2007 ) . Therefore , decision makers can sometimes be forced to rely on guesses based on a designer’s experience of the way it usually is and what should be acceptable ( ibid . ) . Additionally , also later on in projects tacit knowledge and gut feeling plays an important role in complementing the formal decision material ( Johansson , Parida , and Larsson , 2009 ) . Recognizing that such gut feeling or intuition might be a result of years of experience , it is very hard to judge the level of maturity and quality of such emotionally laden knowledge since it is based on personal assumptions and experience more often than established facts . Here , it could be important to gather the ”right” people for the task at hand , the ones that are experienced and recognized in the company for being knowledgeable to influence , and perhaps validate , the decisions that need to be taken so that they can be carried out in the company with increased confidence . A knowledge maturity framework therefore need to support this aspect and both point towards the people who are knowledgeable , as well as being able to assess the expertise and experience that underpins the decision material . It should be noted that another , complementary role of the knowledge maturity framework would be to challenge ingrained assumptions and rule - of - thumb perspectives at decision points . Support for Learning As seen with early development of PSS , the early phases , which require a lot of downstream knowledge about the PSS’s life cycle phases ( i . e . use , maintenance , recycling , etc . ) , are characterized by uncertainty and ambiguity , making decision making challenging ( Ericson et al . , 2007 ) . Based on Mintzberg and Westley’s ( 2001 ) ”thinking first” – ”seeing first” – ”doing first” dimensions to decision making , the ”seeing first” Development of Knowledge Maturity Scales to Support PSS Development in the Aerospace Sector approach involves aspects related to the insecure situation of innovative PSS development , enabling team members to cocreate a shared picture that allows them to see everyone’s concerns , which is particularly relevant in situations where differences in opinions need to be voiced to challenge premature consensus , i . e . avoiding groupthink ( Janis , 1972 ) . A ”thinking first” approach is strong when issues are clear and information is reliable , allowing them to carefully define a problem , analyze its cause , and design a solution . PSS development is normally not as straightforward , and it includes visioning , imagining , playing with ideas or alternatives – learning about the various options to move forward , and reasoning about the pros and cons of each possible decision . Within the knowledge maturity approach , there is a need to support the exploration of what - if scenarios , such as how the perceived risk and expected outcome is influenced by an influx of resources , e . g . adding a certain competence to the team or by starting a knowledge gathering activity . Support for Visualization Closely related to the learning aspect is the requirement to visualize the status of knowledge maturity . Visualization also relates to the ”seeing first” approach ( Mintzberg and Westley , 2001 ) , in that a team needs to see the influence that their individual and collective actions have on the knowledge maturity and the project . Further , the visualization aspect is important when considering knowledge maturity as a boundary object , i . e . the visualization of the criteria and the generic scale works as a catalyst for discussions around knowledge maturity and ambiguity issues , explicating any gaps in the knowledge base and facilitating knowledge sharing and creation to manage those perceived weaknesses ( and take advantage of the strengths ) . A knowledge maturity support needs to provide visualization of the level of maturity relative to the required level at any time of the development activity . Further , impacts of changes ( e . g . influx of resources , etc . ) should also be visualized as part of a learning - focused approach . Support for Traceability In the context of PSS , where the value , performance and life cycle impact of such systems ( or functions ) is related to a wide range of cross - disciplinary , cross - enterprise issues , it is important to trace all the factors that compose the total offer , enabling stakeholders to track and address the relations and dependencies between different areas of the PSS . Using the Technology Readiness Level ( TRL ) scale developed by NASA as a reference , the problem in a PSS perspective is not merely related to the aggregation of the different technical considerations into an overall metric , i . e . deciding whether or not individual technologies are ready for integration into a system or subsystem . Here , the focus is shifted from merely aggregating different issues and topics into a whole , towards supporting the individual traceability of all the aspects that influence the design of a total offer . Support for Prioritization For the purpose of decision making there is a need to prioritise certain factors and decisions . As a consequence it is more important to have a solid knowledge base in certain areas than others . For instance , in the context of aerospace , the most important areas are the ones that have an impact on flight safety and certifications and tests of the products by aerospace authorities , such as the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) in the USA . In these cases a pragmatic decision or adjusting the gate criteria slightly is impossible , because the product will still not be allowed to fly in the end . This has to be C . Johansson , B . Hicks , A . Larsson , M . Bertoni reflected in the maturity scales , highlighting the relative higher importance of these areas . Therefore , there is a need to provide a weighting or a prioritization mechanism to reflect the impact of the more important areas and parts in the whole . Support for Pragmatic Decision Making There is a need to differentiate between the strict no - go decisions ( i . e . when to flag red and possibly terminate the project ) and the more pragmatic decision situation ( i . e . when to flag yellow and continue on the condition that changes are made ) . Considering the complexity and scope of many development projects , particularly those in the PSS domain , obtaining a green flag across all criteria would be an unlikely situation . Furthermore , with so many decisions to be made , work will not stop completely in search of answers to problems raised at the gate reviews . Therefore , it becomes a matter of moving forward with manageable and known risk . Table 2 . Summary of the knowledge maturity requirements . Requirement Knowledge maturity needs to… Boundary negotiation …support establishment and negotiation of boundaries , challenging perceptions of knowledge base .

Pragmatic decision making …support elaboration on risk of taking go - decisions on loose decision bases , i . e . differentiating between no - go and conditional - go decisions based on the quality of the knowledge base . Development of a Knowledge Maturity Scale for the Aerospace Industry From a decision making perspective , shortening lead - time in the offer development phase in the 7DP means that decisions need to be taken with shorter intervals as well as based on incomplete information since they will not have the time to either perform thorough analysis tasks or to wait for final results from ongoing technology / knowledge development projects . However , the need to ground the decisions on a confident knowledge base is as strong as before , or perhaps even stronger due to the life cycle and ownership concerns that forces companies to make a long - term commitment to deliver , without having the time or resources to carefully analyze the consequences of such a commitment . Dealing efficiently with ambiguity and uncertainty in the knowledge base , especially when the most important parameters are not even known to the decision maker ( i . e . unawareness ( Modica and Rustichini , 1994 ) ) is a crucial success factor in this challenging context . Development of Knowledge Maturity Scales to Support PSS Development in the Aerospace Sector This argument shows strong similarities with the knowledge maturity concept in the stage - gate product development process . In both situations , highlighting the uncertainties and the ambiguities in the knowledge base is a main concern . In a stage - gate decision as well as during the quick decision iterations in the 7DP case , it becomes crucial to provide improved confidence for decision makers at the decision point , i . e . when the decision base is too poor , decision makers need to choose to either move on in spite of their poor understanding , thus accepting the risks and dealing with the issues , or if necessary choose to take corrective action immediately . What became evident from the early development steps ( Workshops W1 and W2 ) was the need to assess a decision base over multiple dimensions , since many different , and sometimes contradicting , parameters could influence the quality of the knowledge used at the decision point . These parameters were synthesized into three main dimensions , thought of as having significant influence on the quality of the knowledge base . The three dimensions considered were Input , Method / Tool , and Experience / Expertise . The main rationale for this selection relates to the need to break down the knowledge / information carrier instead of just looking at it as - is and trying to assess it , which would require a very high degree of abstraction , i . e . analyzing the face - value of the information . By dividing the focus onto three dimensions there is a way of getting behind the face - value of the information , making it easier to digest the knowledge and reach adequate conclusions about its maturity as well as understanding the reasons why the knowledge elements look the way they do at the decision point , i . e . essentially describing the underlying process resulting in the knowledge base used at the gate review . Inpu t The input dimension plays an important role for the achievement of the output , i . e . what is introduced into an activity strongly influences what the team gets out of it , regardless of how the team can efficiently perform at the decision point . Therefore , having indicators that help indicate the level to which people may trust the material entering in the design activity is highly beneficial to understand the expected level of quality of the final output , i . e . correctness of the decision taken regarding the design solutions proposed at the gate . Me t hod The means with which the input is formalized is an interesting aspect to consider when analyzing the decision material . Some methods provide more confidence than others . For instance , a full - scale prototype test might give the decision makers more confidence than a hand - based calculation of an idealized model , which is a lot cheaper . Different methods provide different confidence , and this is assumed to have an influence on the confidence of the decision base . Since investing in a prototype test would not be appropriate in some situations , a cheaper and less refined approach might be better suited . It is about finding an appropriate match for the case , and knowing which is good enough for the confidence level needed at the specific time in the decision making process . Experience C . Johansson , B . Hicks , A . Larsson , M . Bertoni The experience and expertise dimension of the decision base considers the people performing the work . Having an expert onboard will add confidence in the material , especially in the early stages where facts are scarce and where the gut feeling and intuition related to experienced and knowledgeable people will be a strong influence , as discovered in Johansson , Parida , and Larsson ( 2009 ) . It should be noted that there is interplay between the three dimensions . For instance , a less refined method can be weighed up by having an expert contribute to the work , which means that if he or she says things are acceptable they can still move on to the next phase with the less refined method applied to the material . The Know l edge Ma t uri t y Sca l e Initially , a base scale was developed ( Workshops W2 and W3 ) to serve as a reference for decision makers . The strength of this is that any team and any development project will have the same base knowledge maturity scale that they start out from . The generic scale was developed through consideration of TRL ( Mankins , 1995 ) and the Capability Maturity Model ( CMM ) ( Paulk et al . , 1993 ) . These were chosen because they are the two main maturity constructs in use in industrial settings and since they deal with the both the artefact ( TRL ) and the development process ( CMM ) which is useful when assessing the knowledge maturity of a decision base , since the decision base and its knowledge maturity will be reflected in both the process to develop it as well as its contents being an artefact . Table 3 depicts the generic narrative scale developed for the knowledge maturity concept , as developed in Johansson et al . ( 2008 ) . Table 3 - Generic narrative scale for knowledge maturity ( adapted from Johansson et al . , 2008 ) . 5 Excellent • The content and rationale is tested and proven . It reflects a known confidence regarding , for instance , risks . • The procedure to produce the content and rationale reflects an approach where tried out methods are used and where workers continually reflect and improve . • Lessons learnt are recorded . 4 Good 3 Acceptable • The content and rationale is more standardized and defined ( i . e . documented and formalized ) . • There is a greater extent of detailing and definition . • The procedure to produce the content and rationale is more stable ( compared to previous levels ) with an element of standardization and repeatability . 2 Dubious 1 Inferior • Content and rationale is characterized by instability ( e . g . poor / no understanding of knowledge base ) . • The procedure to produce the content and rationale is dependant on individuals and formalized methods are non - existent . From the generic base scale , three dimensions related to input , method and experience / expertise were developed ( Workshops W3 and W4 ; see Table 4 ) , with the rationale for them described earlier . As with the generic base scale , this also provides a common reference point for the team from which they can feel confident that the levels Development of Knowledge Maturity Scales to Support PSS Development in the Aerospace Sector are based on a structured thinking , i . e . a level ”5” basically means the same to everyone . Having these pre - defined base scales enforces its usefulness as a boundary object , where a major benefit with the maturity approach is not primarily the exactness of the assessment or having an exact measurement . Rather , the main benefit is that the stakeholders have something to reason about and around , and that they have something related to knowledge , learning and uncertainty to reason about and around . Whenever there is a differing opinion on these issues , this can be highlighted through their individual perceptions of the maturity levels , triggering a discussion relating to the stakeholders’ perception of the project . Table 4 . Generic knowledge maturity scales for input , method , experience . Input Method Experience 5 Excellent Input is detailed and verified Tested , standardized and verified methods that are under continuous review and development .

Essentially , this means that they create their own scales , in their own natural language , as they are accustomed to , from the generic definitions . This makes them adapted specifically to the working context , making it easier to assess what actions needs to be taken , i . e . which methods are specifically mature in the working context , which competences are needed , and what input data , with which quality is need . This process requires the input from experts accustomed to working in the specific context to contribute and make the assessment of what constitutes appropriate definitions for the specific knowledge maturity levels . Of course the assistance of someone acquainted with the knowledge maturity definitions and the rationale behind these definitions is also needed to assist the experts in the definition work . There also needs to be a validation process with independent people coming in as reviewers of the scale definitions being developed , to make sure that the definitions are kept at the right level and that the scales are not altered too much rendering them useless . Further , there is a need for a iteration process with the steering group allowing the scales to be used as acceptance criteria in the following gate , especially in the cases where the decision component represent a high risk C . Johansson , B . Hicks , A . Larsson , M . Bertoni for the company , or where it is ”mission critical” that the decision is accurate , i . e . that confidence mirrors a truly correct decision . Table 5 , below , shows an example of a contextualized scale for a market assessment , which was created by the participants in a VIVACE workshop ( Workshops W3 , W4 and W5 ) . Based on the generic base definitions from Table 4 , the help of several people related to business development in general as well as one person working with market assessment in particular was used for this part of the work . The participants , using the assistance of the researcher to relate the knowledge maturity definitions , discussed and related prior cases of market assessment to arrive at the definitions described in Table 3 . In this process , the industry participants , being experts of how they work , ubiquitously used previous projects that they had worked in , moving back and forth between examples based on experience , making sense of the challenges with creating the scale . The main challenge in this phase is to relate to the best and worst cases imagined , and not the best and worst cases experienced . For example , the fifth level is supposed to represent an optimal state making it rare that it is reached unless extraordinary resources and effort is devoted to it . Therefore , there is a need to be aware of this , so that they do not chose levels they know that they will reach and thus justifying those actions . Table 5 : Contextualized scale for market assessment , as developed by workshop participants . Input Method Experience / expertise 5 Excellent Very good quality of input data with assessment by customer as well as several independent sources Developed support system for risk assessment regarding future volume and prices Long verified experience and expertise within area of concern 4 Good 3 Acceptable Market survey based solely on data from customer Systematic modus operandi with qualitative risk assessment regarding prices and volume Proven experience and competence within area of concern 2 Dubious 1 Inferior Data from customer and independent sources is missing No evaluation of external data Person doing the work is inexperienced ( first time ) Since this practice adds overhead to the team’s workload , not all areas are likely to go through this process . Some areas may be considered as insignificant and thus the base scale will be sufficient . The contextualized scales will naturally be useful beyond the first project , reusing the definitions in future projects faced with similar development efforts . The reuse of adapted TRL scales in the same company shows this value , i . e . reusing the TRL definitions adapted for manufacturing ( i . e . Manufacturing Readiness Level ) . A structure for storing past definitions and a process for reusing them is needed , making sure that the “chain of evidence” is kept , verifying them before reuse , ensuring that errors are not propagated . Development of Knowledge Maturity Scales to Support PSS Development in the Aerospace Sector As the scales have been adapted to the working contexts , the next stage is to apply them in the projects and at the gates . The definitions can be useful both for the teams doing the work , being able to assess ”on the fly” what the level of confidence is , and naturally for the decision makers at the gates . It is therefore recommendable to agree on the scale and the required level of maturity before the work phase , so that the team can know their boundaries and what to expect . As with the current – performance related – criteria , the team and the steering group should agree at the first gate what the level of expectation is for the following gate and so on , also with regard to the knowledge maturity scale . This clarifies the expectations for the next gate and reduces the risk that the scale will be mishandled , setting targets that would be below what it is customary . Once at the gate , when evaluating the previous phase and about to make a decision , it can be useful to allow all stakeholders , regardless of if they are projects leaders or if they are decision makers from the steering group , to assess the project results from a knowledge maturity perspective based on their perception of the results . Thereafter , they have a useful tool for discussing the confidence in the decision being taken by focusing naturally on the weak areas , but also on the ones that have a difference in opinion among the stakeholders . This is where the ambiguity and uncertainty is most likely to be found , and it is here that any decisions on corrective efforts should start . Case to Illustrate the Knowledge Maturity Scale To illustrate the application of the knowledge maturity scale , the following example will show how the scale works in a decision on the market assessment earlier described in an offer development process , such as the 7DP process . The first thing the team and the steering group needs to do is to create the contextualized scale from the base scale , with the application of expertise regarding cost calculations . In the first gate , the scale is completed and approved by the steering group as having levels that adequately represent the levels of knowledge in the case at hand . Thereafter , acceptance criteria for the following gate is set by the stakeholders and agreed by the team . For instance , in this example what are needed to pass the gate are an input of level 4 , a method of level 4 , and an expertise of level 3 . At this point it is time for the team to start working and doing the work in the stage . The acceptance criteria will serve as a guide for the team in how the work in the stage should be approached , regarding the fidelity of the input , methods and expertise that is needed for the activity . For instance , in this example , the expertise level ( 3 ) means that the team can do without the top expertise in the company , and still manage a solid level for the decision , as long as the input and method stay at an adequate level . As the team prepares for the gate they analyze the work conducted during the stage , and compose the results into deliverables . At this point they analyze the results relative to what is needed , i . e . what numbers the market assessment activity can produce in terms of possible market size that is possible . At the same time they use the knowledge maturity scales to assess how well they can trust the numbers that they have produced . After some discussions among the team , they feel content with the results and prepare for the gate review . C . Johansson , B . Hicks , A . Larsson , M . Bertoni Once at the gate review , they will bring their understanding of the level of completeness to the gates . The same assessment is performed by the steering group , and thereafter they discuss the results , mainly focusing on areas that are perceived as too weak and / or areas where the perception between stakeholders differ , trying to find ways to help the project move forward , either by clarifying the perception or , if necessary , by devising actions and milestones where the project needs to be up to the right standards . Having knowledge as an additional assessment dimension , means that they have a more nuanced base to reason about , where of course adequate results and adequate knowledge level is the ultimate situation . If either of them is too low , the team needs to assess whether improvements are necessary , and in that case what kind of improvements are needed and also how quickly things need to catch up . Essentially , this type of coordinative artefacts ( Schmidt and Wagner , 2002 ) or boundary objects ( Star and Griesemer , 1989 ) , plays the role of highlighting the knowledge base and triggering communication between stakeholders , which is a major benefit with the knowledge maturity scale . Discussion The work presented in this paper is based on a conceptual framework , which was developed in close collaboration with aerospace industry partners . Taking into account the extraordinary challenges related to the 7DP , companies in this industry need to develop methods and approaches that are better suited for cross - disciplinary decision making in a virtual enterprise context . However , it should be acknowledged that the knowledge maturity work presented here also builds on a number of assumptions when it comes to forecasting the needs that are not only experienced and expressed within today’s industry context , but which might arise in a not too distant future in light of an increasing interest in product - service system provisions and radically shorter proposal and development phases . Thus , the future workshop approach outlined in the research approach section has been useful in the investigation of both the limitations of the current stage - gate practices , and in the exploration of perceived opportunities to improve those practices with an increased focus on the assessment of the knowledge base used in stage - gate meetings . The knowledge maturity concept puts knowledge at the centre of attention , creating awareness of assumptions ( Lewis , Mahatham , and Wrage , 2004 ) , uncertainties and ambiguities from the different perspectives of the stakeholders participating in the stage - gate process . By highlighting the assumptions and uncertainties , and facilitating a discussion on which uncertainties it makes sense to deal with immediately and which to leave for future consideration , the framework thus provides the decision makers with a tool that can help them feel more confident about the decisions they make . Here , making a confident decision does not imply that all issues have been solved , but rather that the issues are raised – increasing the possibility to identify and mitigate risks by using the collective reasoning ability of the team , as opposed to basing decisions on what can often be ill - founded assumptions or uncertain results . Again , the objective is not to completely eliminate uncertainties or assumptions , but to make decision makers aware that they exist , so they can more confidently start to deal with them . Among other things , the knowledge maturity concept aims to avoid wasting time because the knowledge foundation is too weak . Gaining insights related to the status of the Development of Knowledge Maturity Scales to Support PSS Development in the Aerospace Sector knowledge base early in the process means that mitigating actions could be applied before arriving at a point in the process where it is too late to act . Related to knowledge maturity is a concept briefly described as Knowledge Readiness Level ( KRL ) ( Chiaramonte and Joshi , 2004 ) , which highlights the need to assess the knowledge available to the team . In some cases , all that is needed is to make sure that the right people meet and collaborate , sharing what they know , whereas at the other end of the spectrum a fundamental research initiative is needed , Chiaramonte and Joshi ( 2004 ) argue that “…the cost of the ’answer‘ is related to the KRL . Low KRL’s are relatively inexpensive , while high KRL’s require substantial research funding” ( ibid . , p . 36 ) . One of the crucial aspects related to the acceptance of this kind of method in industry is how to balance its usefulness with the level of overhead required on the part of its users . There are plenty of methods for project management in general , and risk management in particular , and the extra workload on the user is a real barrier towards broad acceptance . A perceived benefit with the proposed approach is that teams do not need to prepare for a knowledge maturity assessment in advance , it merely offers an opportunity to discuss , create awareness and shape shared understanding of the status of the information and knowledge assets under review . Triggering a discussion is the point , so one could argue that there needs to be little precision involved in calibrating the method . It could serve as a checklist , or guideline , which can be dealt with rather quickly in gate review meetings . If major issues should happen to arise as a result of the discussion , the issues need to be acknowledged and mitigation actions registered . If no issues should arise , the team can move on to other agenda items without paying more attention to the method . Thus , the ambition is that the method should be ”lightweight” enough to be perceived as a useful contribution at a low overhead cost , in terms of resources and time . Table 6 elaborates on how knowledge maturity supports the seven requirements that were presented earlier in the paper , explaining the scale’s role of meeting the requirements and supporting the stakeholders in dealing with ambiguities and uncertainties in the gates as well as making decisions on knowledge that potentially is flawed . Given the range of requirements it is not possible to address all the dimensions through a single tool rather in the fullness of time a suite of complementary tools are likely to be needed . As can be seen in Table 6 , there is a need to supplement the knowledge maturity scale with additional developments to fully support decision making in gates when developing PSS . More specifically there is a need for a computer based support tool to integrate and trace the vast amounts of information in the components of a PSS . Additionally , a mechanism for rating and weighting the decision components based on their importance and impact to the development of the PSS also needs development to support the stakeholders both in managing acceptance criteria and in devising and prioritizing actions . Notwithstanding this , the fundamental scales developed and the process of their application provides varied levels of support for the seven requirements . C . Johansson , B . Hicks , A .

Different aspects of a knowledge asset ( i . e . input , method and experience / expertise ) as well as different knowledge elements can be given preference depending on importance to decisions . Pragmatic decision making Knowledge maturity scale . Knowing current status of knowledge base relative to required status provide added confidence ; i . e . stakeholders know when decision base is immature , on what points it is immature , and what they will need to recover before future decision points . Conclusions The purpose of this paper is to revisit previous exploratory and descriptive researches on knowledge maturity , and to propose a practical decision support to increase decision makers’ awareness and understanding of the current status of the knowledge base on which they draw upon when making decisions . Previous studies have observed the decision making dynamics at the gates in an aerospace company , thus discussing how such activity could possibly be supported from a knowledge perspective , as opposed to the traditional performance - based approach . Further , the analysis has outlined the need for methods and tools able to support cross - boundary discussions at the gate , to ensure that any potential risks related to limitations in the knowledge base could be identified and mitigated when making a decision . Development of Knowledge Maturity Scales to Support PSS Development in the Aerospace Sector Thus the paper presents a framework , built upon the knowledge maturity concept , aiming to help stakeholders in more effectively dealing with uncertainty and ambiguity at the decision gate . A total of seven requirements , elicited from previous studies on knowledge maturity , have initially been identified to support decision making in the gates . The requirements include : support for boundary negotiation , tacit knowledge sharing , learning , visualization , traceability , prioritization , and pragmatic decision making . T hree main dimensions have been proposed to assess the maturity of the knowledge at the decision gate : input , method and experience / expertise . With these dimensions ambiguities and uncertainties in the knowledge base may be highlighted by breaking down the knowledge assets into their constituents , going behind the face - value of the documents and outlining the inputs of an activity , the methods and tools by which the activity refines and improves the inputs , and the people contributing to the output , measuring their skill , expertise and experience ( i . e . their fit for purpose ) . Moving from these dimensions , generic as well as contextualized knowledge maturity scales have been created through five workshops involving industrial experts , i . e . design stakeholders often involved in gate activities and in the preparation of the decision material . The knowledge maturity scales are intended as hands - on tools that prescribe stakeholders how to practically work with issues related to knowledge , assumptions , ambiguities and uncertainties . To exemplify their use , the tools have been applied to a case study in an aeronautical industry , with the purpose to assess the role of the knowledge maturity scales as a support for decisions in a gate . The approach presented in this paper offers a way of boosting decision makers’ confidence in situations where information and knowledge about alternatives is in limited supply . Assumptions , ambiguities and uncertainties are inherent features in product development . The knowledge maturity concept may therefore represent a valuable approach for companies to take more conscious decisions at the gates , ensuring that implicit assumptions , ingrained views and provisional results are not mistaken for verified facts . Creating an increased awareness of the status of information and knowledge assets could allow companies to move forward with known risk , rather than making decisions that based on unclear rationale . The use of the knowledge maturity decision support does not ensure that all issues concerning assumptions , uncertainty and ambiguity can be solved . However , it represents a way to ensure that such issues are at least discussed in the cross - disciplinary gate review meetings . By doing so , the possibility to identify and mitigate risks through the collective reasoning ability of the team may be significantly increased . The next step in this work is to test this tool in a number of industrial settings to evaluate its benefits and generality , and also to iterate and improve the tool further .
