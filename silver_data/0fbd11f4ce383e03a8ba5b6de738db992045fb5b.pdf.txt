Specifically , when growing osteoblasts on titanium surfaces with regular micro - ranged geometry , filaments are shorter , less aligned and they concentrate at the top of the geometric structures . Changes to the cytoskeleton network , i . e . , its localization , alignment , orientation , and lengths of the filaments , as well as the overall concentration and distribution of key - actors are induced . For example , integrin is distributed homogeneously , whereas integrin in activated state and vinculin , both components of focal adhesions , have been found clustered on the micro - ranged geometries . Also , the concentration of Rho , an intracellular signaling protein related to focal adhesion regulation , was significantly lower . Results : To explore whether regulations associated with the focal adhesion complex can be responsible for the changed actin filament patterns , a spatial computational model has been developed using ML - Space , a rule - based model description language , and its associated Brownian - motion - based simulator . The focus has been on the deactivation of cofilin in the vicinity of the focal adhesion complex . The results underline the importance of sensing mechanisms to support a clustering of actin filament nucleations on the micro - ranged geometries , and of intracellular diffusion processes , which lead to spatially heterogeneous distributions of active ( dephosphorylated ) cofilin , which in turn influences the organization of the actin network . We find , for example , that the spatial heterogeneity of key molecular actors can explain the difference in filament lengths in cells on different micro - geometries partly , but to explain the full extent , further model assumptions need to be added and experimentally validated . In particular , our findings and hypothesis referring to the role , distribution , and amount of active cofilin have still to be verified in wet - lab experiments . Conclusion : Letting cells grow on surface structures is a possibility to shed new light on the intricate mechanisms that relate membrane and actin related dynamics in the cell . Our results demonstrate the need for declarative expressive spatial modeling approaches that allow probing different hypotheses , and the central role of the focal adhesion complex not only for nucleating actin filaments , but also for regulating possible severing agents locally .

According to the distinct physico - chemical properties of the biomate - rial surfaces , cells have the capacity to adapt to it via cell - specific morphological [ 2 - 4 ] and functional aspects , e . g . , changes in cell morphology , intracellular architecture of adhesion components [ 5 - 7 ] and / or gene and protein expression pathways . For bone cells that were grow - ing on titanium surfaces with regular micro - geometry ( namely pillars or grooves ) , an adaptation of extracellu - lar and intracellular phenotypic traits , including signifi - cantly emerging actin filament patterns , has been shown [ 8 , 9 ] . It could be recognized in diverse experiments that expression and appearance of intracellular structures as well as overall cell shape are influenced by diverse environmental parameters , especially the physical and geometrical properties of the extracellular matrix , e . g . , rigidity , dimensionality , composition and ligand spacing [ 10 - 12 ] . In our experiments human osteoblasts rearrange their actin cytoskeleton in typical patterns mimicking the underlying micro - topography ( 5 μ m dimensions , mate - rial surface in Figure 1 right ) . Those changes have so far emerged independently on several chemical cues and vari - ations [ 13 ] , e . g . , usage of glass instead of the bulk material titanium , micro - structured titanium surfaces modified with ( i ) fibronectin layer due to fetal calf serum , ( ii ) colla - gen I coating of the pillars , ( iii ) sputtering with gold [ 14 ] as well as ( iv ) deposition of a plasma polymer nanolayer exhibiting positively charges to cells [ 7 , 15 ] . However , the mechanisms behind this restructuring of the actin - cytoskeleton are not clear . Actin is an abundant and highly conserved eukaryotic cellular protein and the major cytoskeletal component in all eukaryotic cells . It plays a central role in impor - tant cellular processes , comprising the transduction of extracellular forces and tensions to the nucleus as well as cell spreading and migration processes [ 16 ] . In particu - lar , many studies report that the structural arrangement of the actin cytoskeleton is decisive for subsequent cellu - lar events [ 17 ] , like the length control of cells or protein expression pathways [ 18 ] . Actin exists in two forms : as globular / monomeric G - actin and filamentous / polymeric F - actin , which is self - assembled in linear filaments con - taining + / - ends ( also known as barbed and pointed ends , respectively ) as growing and shrinking sites . The dynamic equilibrium of the continuous reorganization of the actin network is based on its controlled polymerization and depolymerization events , which are guided by a complex interplay of actin with a huge number of regulatory molecules ( 131 listed in [ 19 ] ) . Among those , ADF / cofilin , Rho and ROCK [ 20 ] play a central role . These sustain the balance of actin polymerization and depolymerization and therefore are strongly controlled in their expression and activity pattern [ 16 , 18 , 21 ] . Here , the actin regulatory protein , actin depolymerization factor ( ADF ) / cofilin acts as a key player by severing filaments [ 22 ] . ADF / cofilin becomes inactive when it is phosphorylated at its ser - ine 3 residue . ADF / cofilin activity is controlled by the Rho family of small GTPases . Thereby the recruitment of Rho small GTPase and Rho - associated protein kinase ( ROCK ) leads to subsequent ADF / cofilin phosphoryla - tion [ 23 ] ( see also Figure 2 ) . Also , PIP2 has been shown to influence the activity of ADF / cofilin via different mecha - nisms , including a competitive binding of actin and PIP2 on cofilin [ 21 , 24 ] . Integrins , as transmembrane receptors consisting of an alpha and a beta - chain , are known to provide physical linkages between the extracellular matrix and the actin cytoskeleton via adaptor proteins , e . g . , talin , vinculin , pax - illin , and α - actin [ 25 - 28 ] , thus building a bridge between extracellular space and the cell’s interior [ 29 , 30 ] . In addi - tion , they initiate specific biochemical reactions that fur - ther regulate the formation of actin filaments locally , e . g . , by influencing PIP2 and the cycling of Rho being GTP and GDP bound [ 21 ] . Our hypothesis is that transmembrane receptors like integrin might be affected mechanically by the micro - ranged geometry of the titanium surfaces , and successive biochemical spatial - temporal mechanisms regulate actin polymerization locally . To explore whether this could explain the observed actin filament patterns , i . e . , on a planar surface the growth of long , roughly aligned stress fibers , i . e . , filament bundles , and in cells on pillar struc - tures only shorter filament segments on pillar tops and edges , we conduct a computational study focusing on the interplay of membrane related dynamics and actin formation . Related computational models Many efforts have been made to study actin dynamics at a macroscopic level , incorporating actin’s three nucleotide forms ( ATP - , ADP · Pi - , ADP - bound ) , filament branching , capping and severing at different levels of detail [ 31 - 34 ] . For a comprehensive overview of experiments and mod - els , exploring dynamics of filament formation and the regulation of formation - and branching - enabling proteins , see [ 19 ] . Most of the models are non - spatial . The problem of representing spatial properties can be approached in different ways . For example , the rule - based modeling tool BioNetGen has been applied to model actin filaments growth [ 35 ] , based on previous kinetic models of filament elongation , depolymerization [ 32 ] Bittig etal .

On the planar surface cells are closely attached to the surface with their entire cell body and exhibit a flattened phenotype . On the pillared surface P - 5 × 5 × 5 , cells are elongated and their adhesion is mainly restricted to the surface plateaus ( FE - SEM Supra 25 , Carl Zeiss ; bar = 10 μ m ) , image in cooperation with Regina Lange , Institute of Electronic Appliances and Circuits , University of Rostock ) . Long and well defined filaments actin filaments form in cells on planar surfaces , whereas on the pillared structure P - 5 × 5 × 5 the actin filaments are accumulated on top on the pillars in short fibers ( LSM 410 , Carl Zeiss , green : reflexion mode from the surface , red : phalloidin - TRITC for actin ) [ 9 ] . and branching [ 33 ] . The respective models allow study - ing length and branching structure of a single filament representing its structure as a graph , i . e . , in terms of which molecule is bound to which , without position - ing the actin filament in space . Microscopic simulations of actin filaments , i . e . , where every molecule is repre - sented by an individual model entity with its own position , include a Brownian dynamics simulation of ATP - actin polymerization [ 36 , 37 ] with focus on the process of tread - milling , i . e . , filament growth on the barbed end and simultaneous shrinking at the pointed end . The different polymerization schemes of lammellipodum and lammel - lum are analyzed in [ 38 ] . There , the competing roles of ADF / cofilin and tropomyosin lead to two compart - ments in the cell , one dominated by ADF / cofilin and closer to the leading edge , and another dominated by tropomyosin . As a result , with the distance to the lead - ing edge , a steep increase of filament length could be observed . In [ 34 ] , a comprehensive spatial model incorporat - ing many previous efforts ( cf . [ 19 ] ) is presented . Based on partial differential equations , it is used to investi - gate the effect of the presence of N - WASp ( nuclear Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein ; known to activate Arp2 / 3 , which in turn mediates filament branching ) at the leading edge of migrating cells . By using differential equations , filaments are not individually represented , but their presence and mean length can be determined from the concentrations of filamentous actin and of barbed ends . In our particle - based approach , we decided to leave many details of actin polymerization and depolymeriza - tion processes aside . To shed some light on the mecha - nisms that drive the observed actin filaments patterns on the micro - structured surface , processes at the membrane have to be integrated . Integrin receptors and the form - ing of focal adhesion complexes have been subject to a series of models , e . g . , of focal adhesion - related signaling with focus on RNA inference [ 39 ] , or focusing on mechan - ical aspects [ 40 ] . In the above examples the simulation approaches [ 41 , 42 ] range from non - spatial determinis - tic population - based modeling ( ODEs in [ 31 , 33 , 34 , 39 ] ) , Bittig etal .

The blue arrows express the total protein expression on the micro - pillared surface in relation to the planar reference based on the biological data obtained from the wet - lab experiments ( see Results ) . discrete stochastic ( [ 32 , 35 ] ) , via mesoscopic ( PDEs in [ 34 ] ) to microscopic techniques ( individuals with Brownian motion in [ 38 ] , Browian dynamics in [ 36 , 37 ] ) . Focus of this work Whereas most actin models are aimed at analyzing phys - iological processes that drive actin polymerization and depolymerization , our goal is to understand the impact of a micro - topographic material structure . The focus of modeling turns towards spatial temporal processes close to the membrane . For this , we need to describe geomet - ric structures in continuous space and their interaction with the cell . Thus , a spatial modeling approach shall be pursued [ 43 ] . As polymerization of actin filaments shall be described as concrete structures developing in continuous space , approaches that are based on discrete space , or assume no volumes associated with the key players ( e . g . , as adopted in [ 44 ] ) do not appear suitable . The same hinders exploit - ing approaches based on partial differential equations ( e . g . , as in [ 34 ] ) . A definition as cellular automata [ 45 ] would constrain the spatial dynamics to the chosen grid granularity and shape . To represent structures emerging from moving molecules in the cell , we thus pursue a microscopic , individual - based approach with movement of molecules approximated by Brownian motion , where molecules cease moving when binding to form fila - ments . We use an adapted variant of ML - Space [ 46 ] that allows placement of molecules in relation to their binding partners . Similarly as in [ 38 ] , we keep our model of filament formation as abstract as possible in order to reduce both the number of unknown parameters and the num - ber of simulated particles . Regarding the former , while kinetics of regulatory proteins have been explored pre - viously , conversion of these macroscopic rates to micro - scopic rates for particle - based simulation would require knowledge of size and diffusion constants of the involved species . Regarding the latter , particle - based simulation is computationally expensive , so simulating a realistic amount of entities ( i . e . , approaching the number of those present in the cell ) becomes infeasible . Unlike models that cover the actin dynamics at the leading edge dur - ing cell migration , in our study , the processes of interest take place at the center of the osteoblasts growing on the micro - topographies .

BMCSystemsBiology 2014 , 8 : 106 Page 5 of 19 http : / / www . biomedcentral . com / 1752 - 0509 / 8 / 106 In the following sections , we first present wet - lab exper - iments done in addition to previously published ones [ 9 ] . These experiments motivated the modeling efforts and influenced the choices of abstraction in the model . In the next section , we describe our choice of modeling and sim - ulation approach and introduce the key reactions of the model created here . The following section contains results of wet - lab and dry - lab experiments . We conclude with model extensions and wet - lab experiments planned in the future . Methods Wet - lab experiments Titanium arrays For the experiments , defined micro - structured titanium arrays ( single sizing 10 × 10mm ) with a periodical cubic pillar geometry with a pillar dimension of 5 × 5 × 5 μ m ( length × width × height ) and a pitch width of 10 μ m ( subsequently called P - 5 × 5 × 5 or P - 5 × 5 ) were used . These samples were fabricated by using deep reactive - ion etching technology ( DRIE ) ( Center for Microtechnologies ZFM , Chemnitz , Germany ) for defined micro - structuring of the titanium wafers . As respective control planar titanium wafers were used ( subsequently called Ref ) . Qualitative analysis of the samples was made by using field - emission scanning electron microscopy ( FE - SEM Supra 25 ; Carl Zeiss , Jena , Germany ) . Cell culture Samples were washed in 70 % ethanol for 15 min , rinsed in phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) ( PAA Labo - ratories , Pasching , Austria ) and then placed into 4 - well NUNC dishes ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , NUNC GmbH & Co . KG , Langenselbold , Germany ) . Afterwards human osteoblastic cells ( MG - 63 , purchased from ATCC ; No . CRL - 1427 ) were seeded at a density of 3 × 10 4 cells / array in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium ( DMEM ) ( Invitro - gen GmbH , Karlsruhe , Germany ) , containing 10 % fetal calf serum ( FCS ) ( PAA Laboratories , Pasching , Austria ) and 1 % gentamicin ( Ratiopharm GmbH , Ulm , Germany ) at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere with 5 % CO 2 . Cell morphology Cell morphology of MG - 63 cells was visualized after 24 h cultivation time on the titanium arrays ( see Figure 1 top ) by using the field - emission scanning electron microscope FE - SEM Supra 25 ( Carl Zeiss , Jena , Germany ) without gold coating at a low acceleration voltage of 1 kV . Before examination of cell morphology , cells that were grown on the titanium arrays for 24 h were fixed with 2 . 5 % glu - taraldehyde ( 1 h , 4°C ) , dehydrated through a graded series of acetone ( 30 % 5 min , 50 % 5 min , 75 % 10 min , 90 % 15 min , 100 % twice for 10 min ) and dried in a critical point dryer ( K 850 , EMITECH , Taunusstein , Germany ) . Microscopic analysis of the actin cytoskeleton MG - 63 cells were cultured on the samples for 24 h and then fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde ( PFA ; 10 min , room temperature ) . Afterwards cells were washed twice with PBS , permeabilized with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 ( 10 min , room temperature ) ( Merck , Darmstadt , Germany ) . Afterwards cells were incubated with phalloidin - TRITC ( diluted 1 : 10 ) ( Sigma Aldrich Chemie GmbH , München , Germany ) for 30 min in the dark at room temperature , washed again and embedded with a cover slip in mounting medium . Actin staining was investigated with an inverted confo - cal laser scanning microscope LSM 410 ( Carl Zeiss , Jena , Germany ) equipped with a helium / neon - ion laser ( excita - tion : 543 nm ) and a ZEISS 63x water immersion objective ( C - Apochromat 63 , 1 . 25 W / 0 . 17 ) . Actin quantification via FilaQuant software The confocal images ( 512 × 512 pixels ) were used for subsequent actin quantification via mathematical image processing by the FilaQuant software [ 9 , 47 ] . They were automatically processed in three steps : preprocessing , where the main sources of errors based on image acqui - sition , i . e . , noise and irregular background illumination , were reduced , followed by feature detection and quan - tification . The resulting parameters for the description of actin filament formation were as follows : total filament length , average filament length , maximum filament length and orientation dispersion . The parameter “orientation dispersion” , also known as angular deviation , describes the presence of a preferred orientation of the actin filaments . We here use normalized values ranging from 0 % , implying exactly one preferred orientation , to 100 % , indicating the maximum possible value determined by the method ( [ 48 ] , p . 28 ) and thus a uniform distribution of oriented length to total length ratio . For examining actin filament forma - tion in MG - 63 cells on the pillared ( P - 5 × 5 × 5 ) and planar reference titanium array ( Ref ) , 30 cells per specimen were analyzed with FilaQuant . Microscopic analysis of integrin receptor β 1 Integrin β 1 : MG - 63 cells were cultured for 24 h on the titanium samples , then washed twice with PBS ( + Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + ) and incubated with mouse anti - human mon - oclonal antibody against the integrin β 1 ( CD29 , 1 : 20 ) ( Beckman Coulter ) for 30 min . After washing with PBS , cells were incubated with AlexaFluor 488 - labeled sec - ondary goat anti - mouse IgG ( 1 : 300 ) ( Molecular Probes ) for 30 min in the dark , afterwards fixed with 4 % PFA for 10 min and embedded . The formation of integrin adhe - sions was analyzed with the LSM 410 using the argon laser ( excitation : 488 nm ) ( Carl Zeiss ) . Activated β 1 integrin via 9EG7 : 9EG7 detects a specific epitope of the receptor – the ligand - bound conformation of β 1 integrins [ 49 ] . MG - 63 cells were cultured for 24 h Bittig etal . BMCSystemsBiology 2014 , 8 : 106 Page 6 of 19 http : / / www . biomedcentral . com / 1752 - 0509 / 8 / 106 ( DMEM , + 10 % FCS ( Superior , Biochrom AG / Merck ) on the titanium samples , washed with PBS and incubated with the primary antibody purified rat anti - mouse CD29 , 9EG7 ( 1 : 40 in PBS ; BD Pharmingen , BD Biosciences ) for 60 min at room temperature . After washing with PBS , cells were incubated with the secondary antibody Alexa Fluor® 488 goat anti - mouse IgG ( 1 : 100 in PBS , Life Tech - nologies GmbH , Invitrogen ) for 30 min in the dark . After washing again , cells were fixed with 4 % PFA for 10 min at room temperature and embedded in Fluoroshield ( Sigma - Aldrich Co . LLC ) . The activated integrins were analyzed with the LSM 780 using the argon laser ( excitation : 488 nm ) ( Carl Zeiss ) . Protein extraction After 24 h cultivation time on the titanium arrays , cells were harvested with 0 . 05 % trypsin - 0 . 02 % EDTA and kept on ice , immediately . Cell extracts were prepared with Bio - Plex Cell Lysis Kit ( Bio - Rad Laboratories , Hercules , USA ) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations . The cell lysates were sonicated and centrifuged at 8 , 000 g for 2 min at 4°C . The protein in the supernatants were pooled together and stored at - 80°C . Total soluble protein con - centrations were estimated by Bradford protein assay [ 50 ] and verified by Coomassie staining [ 51 ] so that equal amounts of total cellular protein could be used for sub - sequent Western Blot analysis and quantification of the phosphorylation level of signaling proteins . Western blot For Western Blot analysis total cellular protein lysates were separated by SDS - PAGE and blotted on PVDF membranes . After the protein transfer membranes were blocked with 5 % skim milk in Tris - buffered saline ( TBS ) and washed six times in TBS . For protein detec - tion primary antibodies anti - Rho A , anti - ROCK and anti - vinculin ( Sigma Aldrich Co . LLc , US ) were incu - bated overnight at 4°C followed by a labeling with a horseradish peroxidase - conjugated secondary antibody ( Dako , Glostrup , Denmark ) for 1 h at room temperature . Protein signals were visualized by using SuperSignal West Femto Chemiluminescent Substrate ( Pierce Biotechnol - ogy , Rockford , USA ) for detection of peroxidase activity from HRP - conjugated antibodies ( Thermo Fisher Scien - tific Inc . , Rockford , USA . Band intensity was analyzed densitometricly with the Molecular Imager ChemiDoc XRS and Image Lab 3 . 0 . 1 software ( Bio - Rad Laboratories , Hercules , USA ) . Each protein detection was repeated at least three times with individual prepared cell lysates from independent passaged cells . Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS - software version 15 . 0 for Windows ( SPSS Inc . , Chicago , IL , USA ) : Kolmogorov - Smirnov test and unpaired samples t - test . Data were presented as a mean ± standard deviation ( SD ) . In silico modeling Modeling and simulation approach : ML - Space ML - Space is a model description language for spatial sim - ulation . It is based on ML - Rules [ 52 ] , a multi - level mod - eling language that allows describing dynamically nested systems . Both ML - Rules and ML - Space are rule - based approaches ( see also [ 53 , 54 ] ) . While ML - Space aims to facilitate modeling and simulation with discretized and continuous space , we here focus on the latter part where entities are modeled individually moving in continuous space ( hence we will use the term particles synony - mously ) . SRSim [ 55 ] is another approach bringing together rule - based modeling and spatial simulation . Recently , also the rule - based language Kappa has been equipped with a coarse grained Brownian dynamics execution approach [ 56 ] . However , neither supports nesting of enti - ties , which is a distinctive feature of ML - Space and will be used here to represent regions that can contain the same kinds of entities as their surroundings , but where these entities may behave differently . In our approach , Brownian diffusion of particles is rep - resented by position updates in continuous space in dis - crete time steps . For each particle , such a simulation step consists of 1 . determining a vector such that the particle moves a random distance drawn from N ( 0 , 2 D i (cid:4) t ) along each coordinate axis , where D i is the particle’s associated diffusion constant and (cid:4) t the time since the last posi - tion update attempt . This approach is derived from Einstein - Smoluchowski equation and commonly used for particle - based simulation ( e . g . , [ 38 , 56 ] ) . The aver - age step length here is chosen to correspond to the diameter of the smallest particle ( or a factor thereof ) and the time steps (cid:4) t between position updates are chosen accordingly for each particle . 2 . determining overlap with other particles after the move , i . e . , after updating the position by the said vec - tor . If this results in overlap with other particles ( i . e . , a collision ) , either ( a ) letting the particles react , i . e . , finding an appli - cable reaction rule ( see below ) in the model and applying the associated changes , then resolving the collision by moving the updated particle slightly such that it does not overlap the other anymore , or ( b ) in absence of applicable reactions , undo move and start again with the first step , unless this is already the 4th such attempt ( number Bittig etal . BMCSystemsBiology 2014 , 8 : 106 Page 7 of 19 http : / / www . biomedcentral . com / 1752 - 0509 / 8 / 106 customizable ) ; then conclude that there is no space for the particle to move . 3 . scheduling a new move event for this particle in (cid:4) t . Check for changes in first - order events , i . e . , rates of first - order reactions for this particle , and reschedule appropriate event like in classical stochastic simula - tion ( cf . [ 57 ] ) . Reactions are formulated as rules consisting of a left side specifying initial reactants , a right hand side with changed reactants and products , if applicable , and finally a rate expression . The rules can describe time - triggered or collision - triggered events . Time triggered events ( zeroth - or first - order reactions ) affect at most one ( previously existing ) model entity ( although they may entail the cre - ation of new ones ) . Here , the rate expression relates to the propensity of the reaction to occur as in usual stochas - tic simulation , i . e . , time intervals between occurences of a reaction with rate r j follow an exponential distribution with parameter 1 r j . A reaction applicable to several par - ticles is scheduled for each of them separately , as the particles are distinct entities due to their different posi - tions . Stochastic race is used to determine who is first . ( Note that in non - spatial stochastic simulation , reactions of order larger than one , like the example given , are also time - triggered , and parameter of the exponential distri - bution from which the next reaction time is drawn is adjusted for the concentration of available reactants in the given volume ) . Second - order reactions can happen only between spa - tially close entities . We thus call them collision - triggered , since they are only applicable when the entities’ move - ment ( i . e . , diffusion , see above ) has resulted in a colli - sion . The reaction rate expression is to be interpreted as probability of the reaction happening once the col - lision has already occurred . These probabilities can be calculated based on macroscopic and microscopic rate constants , particles diffusion constants and sizes [ 58 ] , however , the latter are often not known with reason - able accuracy ( and may depend on organism and cell type ) . Reactions of order three or higher must be broken down into several elementary reactions of lower order , as is cus - tomary in spatial simulation , with intermediate entities or entity states . Collision - triggered reactions may consist of a smaller entity entering a larger one it collides with , e . g . , a cellular compartment . We use this here to specify regions of the cell with possible contact to the struc - tures on the underlying titanium surface . As men - tioned , rules can be specified as being applicable only to entities nested in a given other , i . e . , compartment or region . Second - order reactions may also involve binding of enti - ties , i . e . the participants stay together after the reaction . Dissolution of a bond again may be a time - triggered reac - tion or triggered by collision with another , non - bound entity . The unbound entity or entities can simply diffuse freely again starting from their current position ( which may lead to prompt rebinding ; cf . [ 59 ] ) . For all entities , the number of binding sites and angles between binding sites must be specified , and an entity binding to a previously free binding site of an entity with an already occupied site will always be placed such that the relative angle matches the specification , independent of its previous position , i . e . , the angle from which it collided . This is used here , for example , to achieve straight actin filament segments by placing an free actin binding to a barbed end of a filamen - tous actin directly opposite ( i . e . , at a relative angle of 180° ) the latter’s already present binding partner at the pointed end . A demo software tool containing the ML - Space simula - tor is provided as Additional file 1 . Model abstractions Since we will primarily focus on the interface of the ( struc - tured ) surface and the membrane of the cell growing on it , and since the cells ultimately are lying relatively flat on the surface ( see also the cell morphology shown in Figure 1 ) , we use a two - dimensional model to describe the system ( although ML - Space supports 2D and 3D simula - tions ) . Our model thus covers a section of the cell near the surface and involves both entities that are actually mostly part of the membrane ( e . g . , receptor complexes ) as well as those from the cytoplasm ( e . g . , free actin ) . To keep com - putational effort to a reasonable limit , our models only comprise a section of the center of the cell . We chose an area large enough to fit 3 × 3 pillars of 5 μ m width with an equally wide gap between them . Even this area can fit a much higher number of enti - ties ( many million proteins at a diameter of 4 – 6 nm , for example ) than can be simulated in reasonable time ( usu - ally a five - digit number of steps per second depending on machine and scenario ) . We thus needed to simu - late fewer actin molecules than realistically present in the considered area , usually a few thousand per run . Since what is observed in microscopic images of fila - ment formation are actually bundles of actin filaments , we chose the size of actin particles larger than it should be relative to the surface structures . The simulation of actin binding in silico can be thought of as represent - ing the formation of several filaments at once . We chose the remaining particle size parameters in proportion to the protein sizes ( measured in number of amino acids ) for lack of authoritative information , and their diffu - sion constants inversely proportional to the size’s square roots .

The part in angle brackets gives the binding sites and their angles relative to each other . The pointed end is for connecting to an exist - ing filament and the barbed end is where filament growth can subsequently continue . Two binding sites for branch - ing are given to allow for branches extending to either side of the filament chain ( at an angle of 70° relative to the growth direction ) . In our model , the focal adhesion complexis represented solely by the integrin entity that forms part of it ( whose attribute “focal” has the value “yes” ) ; further binding part - ners of the complex are not explicitly represented in the model . Its sole binding site will later be used to bind an actin to form the start of a filament . A full model description including definitions of used constants , the branch - initiating species’ defini - tion and branching reactions is provided as Additional file 2 . Modeling surface structure The model also explicitly includes the surface structures . As ML - Space supports hierarchical nesting , e . g . , to repre - sent a cell nucleus and proteins inside and outside of it , the extra - cellular surface structure can be represented the same way as a cellular compartment . 3 SurfStruct ( shape : square , boundary : soft , size : 5 * 5 ) ; A specially treated attribute “boundary” has been added whose value “soft” indicates that this structure is not bounded by a membrane , which would require placing other model entities completely on either side of it . With a soft boundary the structure represents a “region” whose boundary can be overlapped ( whether a particle belongs to the structure or the surrounding is then decided by the position of the particle’s center ) . Still , rules have to be specified indicating which particles can enter and leave the region and with which probability they do so when their center moves across the boundary . Attribute values of the moving entities may be changed in the process . Integrin ( ) + SurfStruct ( ) - > SurfStruct ( ) [ Integrin ( focal : yes ) ] @ 1 SurfStruct ( ) [ Integrin ( ) ] - > Integrin ( focal : no ) + SurfStruct ( ) @ 1 The example would express that integrins can enter the surface structure anytime ( probability 1 after the @ symbol ) and that each integrin that moves onto a sur - face structure is considered to immediately bind to an ( excluded ) surface - sensing agent and become part of a focal adhesion complex ( attribute change on the right ) . This may not be a realistic assumption . It should also be considered that a complex of proteins would in real - ity diffuse more slowly and thus the diffusion attribute should be changed along the way . Moreover , slowing dif - fusion in distinct regions typically implies accumulation of the slowed down entities in that region [ 60 ] , while at the same time the slowdown of activated integrin at the sur - face structure might facilitate the recruitment of cytosolic proteins ( as indicated in [ 61 ] for slow binding kinetics ) and might help clustering the focal adhesion complexes at the surface structure . The forming of the focal adhe - sion / integrin receptor complex can thus alternatively be modeled to happen on surface structures with a certain rate rIntComplexFormation . 4 SurfStruct ( ) [ Integrin ( focal : no ) ] - > SurfStruct ( ) [ Integrin ( focal : yes , diffusion : intDiff * intSlowdownFactor ) ] @ rIntComplexFormation 5 Integrin ( focal : yes ) < bs : FREE > - > Integrin ( focal : no , diffusion : intDiff ) @ rIntComplexDis 6 Integrin ( ) + SurfStruct ( ) - > SurfStruct ( ) [ Integrin ( ) ] @ pIntOntoStruct 7 SurfStruct ( ) [ Integrin ( ) ] - > Integrin ( focal : no ) + SurfStruct ( ) @ 1 The above also includes a reaction of a focal adhesion complex dissolving , resulting in a freely moving integrin .

We start with a very simple model where free actin exists in only one state ( ready to bind to a filament ) , filaments grow only at the barbed end and filament formation is dependent on an activated integrin receptor / focal adhesion complex . 8 Integrin ( focal : yes ) < bs : FREE > + Actin ( ) < pointed : FREE > - > Integrin ( diffusion : 0 ) < bs : new > . Actin ( diffusion : 0 ) < pointed : new > 9 Actin ( ) < pointed : OCC , barbed : FREE > + Actin ( ) < pointed : FREE > - > Actin ( ) < pointed : OCC , barbed : new > . Actin ( diffusion : 0 ) < pointed : new > Here , O CC ( or O CCUPIED ) indicates that something , no matter what , is bound at this binding site , where F REE specifies the opposite . The keyword new ( or a different one that occurs exactly twice , e . g . , “bind” ) indicates a bond of the respective two entities via the respective binding sites , or establishing of a new bond if it occurs on the right hand side of a rule . All our “filaments” , even those consist - ing of only two molecules , are considered to be immobile , i . e . , we do not model any filament movement . Model reactions : filament severing We include in our model a species filling the role of severing actin filaments on collision at the impact site ( i . e . , the filamentous actin it collided with ) . This species , called cofilin , can be active or not ( although actual cofilin proteins influence actin filaments in significantly more complex ways [ 32 , 34 , 63 ] ; note that the actual cofilin is inactive when phosphorylated ) . 10 Cofilin ( active : yes ) + Actin ( ) < pointed : OCC > - > Cofilin ( ) + Actin ( diffusion : actinDiff ) < pointed : FREE , barbed : FREE > @ pActRelease 11 Actin ( ) < pointed : FREE , barbed : OCC > - > Actin ( diffusion : actinDiff ) < barbed : FREE > @ rFilDissolution The first rule specifies that if active cofilin collides with an actin that has another entity bound at the pointed end , all bindings of the actin are released ( potential branching sites omitted above ) with given probability . As binding is a symmetric relationship , what is bound at the pointed and barbed end will be affected by this rule , too : the value of its respective binding site will be set to F REE as well . The second rule says that the remaining filament part start - ing with a free pointed end actin will be dissolve from the pointed end ( if the specified rate rFilDissolution is > 0 ; in our simulations we used an infinite rate , i . e . , the whole chain will be converted to free actins in the same time step , as the same rule will be applied successively to all actins in the remaining filament trunk ) . Wet - lab results indicated that cofilin activity is ( nega - tively ) regulated by actors related to the integrin receptor complex . We integrated two different potential regulatory relations into our model . First , we let cofilin be deactivated on every contact with the focal adhesion complex , and get reactivated on its own ( i . e . , by agents assumed to be constant and not explicitly in the model ) with a given rate rCofilinReactivation . 12 Integrin ( focal : yes ) + Cofilin ( active : yes ) - > Integrin ( ) + Cofilin ( active : no ) @ pCofDeactAtInt 13 Cofilin ( active : no ) - > Cofilin ( active : yes ) @ rCofilinReactivation Secondly , we represented the intermediate steps by an intermediate component called CofReg , which stands in for several potential regulatory proteins possibly in a multi - step cascade whose details , including kinetic parameters , i . e . , reaction rates , are not known . Our CofReg deactivates cofilin and is itself activated at the focal adhesion complex . We let CofReg appear near the recep - tor complex and disappear with a certain rate . Alter - natively , one could simulate a fixed amount of CofReg entities that are activated near the receptor and get deac - tivated on their own , like cofilin . Both variants should lead to the same patterns with respect to amounts and distribution of active CofReg during the simula - tion . The second alternative requires more simulation effort for the inactive CofReg not present otherwise ( and could also lead to more molecular crowding effects due to molecules impeding each other’s movement more often , which is undesired here since our 2 - dimensional approach already leads to occasional spurious blocking of particles ) . 14 Integrin ( focal : yes ) - > Integrin ( ) + CofReg ( ) @ rCofRegAppearance 15 CofReg ( ) - > @ rCofRegDisappearance 16 CofReg ( ) + Cofilin ( active : yes ) - > CofReg ( ) + Cofilin ( active : no ) @ 1 17 Cofilin ( active : no ) - > Cofilin ( active : yes ) @ rCofilinReactivation By setting either pCofDeactAtInt or rCofRegAppearance to 0 one can then select the mechanism to be simulated .

BMCSystemsBiology 2014 , 8 : 106 Page 10 of 19 http : / / www . biomedcentral . com / 1752 - 0509 / 8 / 106 Simulation and experiments We simulated models with differences in some mecha - nisms , e . g . , regarding cofilin activity ( holding active cofilin constant , having it deactivated as first - order reaction , cofilin deactivation by the integrin / focal adhesion com - plex or by an intermediate entity that is itself activated by the receptor complex ) . For lack of information on the amounts of proteins of each type and the reaction proba - bilities , we tested different values for crucial parameters . We simulated our model with all possible combina - tions of values for key parameters given in Table 1 . In addition , we also ran simulations with cofilin activ - ity regulation directly at the integrin receptor com - plex ( pCofDeactAtInt = 1 ) , i . e . , without any CofReg ( rCofRegAppearance = 0 ) . For collision - triggered reac - tion , a decrease in the probability of the reaction happen - ing on each collision and an increase in the amount of a reactant by the same factor have opposite effects on the number of occurring reactions , which roughly cancel each other . Probabilities of collision - triggered reactions were thus set to 1 or near 1 , unless otherwise noted . The simulations were repeated several times , with a very small variance . Thus , in the following we will focus on one set of results . The simulation end time was the same for all runs ( 48 a . u . ) and chosen from experience with pre - vious tests such that no significant change in key model outcomes , especially average filament lengths , should be expected anymore .

Results Wet - lab experiments Cell morphology The morphology of MG - 63 osteoblasts after 24 h cultiva - tion time on the titanium arrays is shown in Figure 1 . The SEM images show that on the planar reference ( Ref ) , the cells are flattened and attached to the surface with their whole cell body . In contrast , on P - 5 × 5 × 5 cells preferen - tially adhere to the surface plateaus , namely the top of the pillars , and only the filopods reach the bottom of the sur - face . Regarding cell shape , cells are more elongated on the micro - pillared surface than on the planar sample . Quantification of actin filament formation Actin is the major component of the cellular cytoskeleton and is of elementary importance for diverse cellular pro - cesses that control morphological and physiological cellu - lar traits . We investigated actin cytoskeleton architecture in dependence on defined surface topography with con - focal laser scanning microscopy subsequently followed by the quantification of actin filament formation via the software FilaQuant . Confocal microscopy demonstrated that on the planar reference ( Ref ) actin is organized in a network of long and well - defined stress fibers typically spanning the entire cell body ( Figure 1 bottom ) . In con - trast , on P - 5 × 5 × 5 actin only forms short fibers , which are concentrated on the edges and tops of the micro - pillars and demonstrate an adaptation of actin fila - ment formation to the underlying surface topography [ 8 ] . Based on the confocal images , actin filament formation was subsequently quantified automatically via FilaQuant software [ 9 , 47 , 48 ] . The average length of filaments ( μ m ) was lower by more than 60 % on the pillared structure in comparison to the planar structure , the spatial orientation was significantly disturbed as calculated by the parameter orientation dispersion [ 9 ] . Protein expression The actin - binding proteins Rho A and ROCK - 1 , also linked with cofilin , are of essential relevance in actin remodeling process . Western blot analysis revealed that the expression of Rho A in MG - 63 osteoblasts on P - 5 × 5 × 5 was significantly lower after 24 h compared to the reference ( Ref ; Figure 3 ) . Also vinculin as protein in focal adhesions was significantly lower expressed in cells on pillars . In contrast no statistical difference in ROCK - 1 protein expression between the micro - pillared and the planar titanium surface could be detected . Bittig etal .

Formation of β 1 integrin adhesions Integrins are central members of focal adhesions sites between cells and biomaterial and play a major role in receptor - mediated adhesion processes . Via distinct adap - tor proteins they are linked to the actin cytoskeleton and thus have decisive effects on its formation . Confocal microscopic analysis of β 1 integrin formation in MG - 63 cells after 24 h showed that on both titanium surfaces – the micro - pillared P - 5 × 5 × 5 surface as well as on the pla - nar reference ( Ref ) – there is a homogeneous distribution and no clustering or accumulation of β 1 integrins near micro - pillars could be observed ( Figure 4 ) . However , these measurements cover integrins in any state , not only activated integrins required for forma - tion of focal adhesions . More recent experiments , also motivated by the results of our simulation experiments , investigate the activated integrin state via the 9EG7 anti - body . They revealed that on pillars the activated integrins of the cells seem to be more clustered in parts compared to the surroundings ( Figure 5 ) . However , activated integrins can be still found between the pillars ( Figure 5 bottom right ) , whereas the actin appears strictly constrained to the pillared regions . Note that vinculin , which is also part of focal adhesions , was already previously found to be clustered on pillars ( [ 8 ] , Figure ten ) . Simulation In our in silico experiments , we compare different strate - gies of activating integrin , analyze the impact of changing the amount of integrin , actin , or cofilin in the system , and take a closer look at the impact of the severing mechanisms and the local distribution of the severing agent . Amounts of key players The amount of actin is the most obvious determining factor of filament lengths . Too few of them , and fil - aments eventually run out of free monomers to bind , staying short . Too many actins , however , and many simulation steps consist of actin moves and possibly Figure 4 Localization of β 1 integrin in MG - 63 osteoblasts on the planar surface ( left ) and the micro - pillars ( dimension 5 × 5 × 5 μ m , right ) after 24 h . On both titanium surfaces there is a homogeneous distribution of integrin β 1 receptor throughout the whole cell ( LSM 410 , Carl Zeiss ) . Bittig etal . BMCSystemsBiology 2014 , 8 : 106 Page 12 of 19 http : / / www . biomedcentral . com / 1752 - 0509 / 8 / 106 Figure 5 Activated β 1 integrin , detected by 9EG7 , in MG - 63 osteoblasts on micro - pillars . On the planar surface ( left ) activated β 1 integrins are homogeneously distributed , whereas on the micro - pillared surface ( right ) activated β 1 integrins are partly clustered on top of the pillars ( arrows ) . Note that activated β 1 integrins are not clustered solely on pillars but formed also aggregates in parts in between the pillars ( arrowhead ) . Confocal microscopy ( LSM 780 , Carl Zeiss , bars = 10 μ m upper row , 2 μ m lower row ) . collisions without reaction , especially at the beginning of the simulation when few nucleation points or filament ends are available . Since actins in filaments are more tightly packed than free actins , once enough actins are bound to filaments , the few left free actins ( or those freed again by depolymerization ) move through larger patches of empty space before occasionally encountering a fila - ment to bind to again . Thus , we decided to start with a comparatively low amount of actin and to create actin molecules during the simulation to roughly maintain the density of free actin . This can be interpreted as recruit - ment of free actin from the cytosol . Once we did this , the initial amount of actin was no longer a key parameter for the length of filaments encountered later . Since in our model filament formation starts at an inte - grin receptor complex and we allow only one filament at each of them , the amount of integrins in the system lim - its the number of filaments that can form . When integrins could easily turn into focal adhesions ( and thus filament nucleation points ) , their amount was indeed found to neg - atively influence the resulting average filament length ( as illustrated in Figure 6 ) , at least when keeping other param - eters constant . This means that when actin is added at a constant rate as above and filaments are severed , a sim - ulation with more integrin must be run longer to exhibit filaments of same average length as a simulation with fewer integrin . When filament severing happens often , the integrin amount becomes less relevant : filaments stay comparatively short independent of whether there are few or many of them . More cofilin , i . e . , filament severing agent , in the sim - ulation expectedly lead to shorter filaments ( again when keeping other parameters constant ) . However , it was the amount of active cofilin that is relevant for fila - ment lengths , and the amount of active cofilin depends on these other parameters , i . e . , the rates of reactions Bittig etal .

Magenta circles represent actin entities with other entities bound at both ends ( i . e . , in filament chains ) , light blue circles are actins at filement ends ( i . e . , occupied pointed end , free barbed end ) , Purple / dark blue circles : free actin , smaller red circles : integrins at start of filament , dark green and brown circles , free integrin on and outside of a surface structure . Surface structure boundaries marked by green dashed lines . Too little actin can lead to relatively short filaments ( left ) , too little integrin and abundant actin to a few long filaments and many free actins that have no room to bind to a filament ( right ) . Filament “growth” can also be impeded by the two - dimensional approach where filament crossing or bending is not allowed ( center right ; note also several free actins trapped in regions bound by different filament segments ) . regulating cofilin activity ( see “Severing by cofilin” below and Figure 7 ) , so the total cofilin amount alone is not a key parameter . Mechanisms of integrin activation The mechanism by which free integrin turned into focal adhesions – with a certain stochastic rate ( but only when on surface structures ) or instantly upon entering such a surface structure ( cf . “Modeling surface structure” ) – made no difference to the simulation results .

Each marker indicates the result of a simulation run with different parameters . Colors denote parameters related to the cofilin activation mechanism , marker types distinguish simulations of pillar structure systems ( triangles ) and planar surfaces ( circles ) , and larger markers indicate simulations with 200 initial integrin entities vs . 100 for the smaller markers ( mostly to be found above the former ) . More active cofilin thus coincides with shorter filaments . integrin had the same effect – what mattered was the amount of active integrin / focal adhesions available for filament formation . The initially hypothesized slowdown of integrin on pil - lars in our simulations leads to accumulation on these structures . When at the same time integrins cannot eas - ily enter a surface structure ( see also Additional file 3 ) , a rougly homogeneous distribution of integrin can be achieved , too ( cf . Figure 4 ) . However , in our simulation most integrins eventually organize in focal adhesions . This is partly because we limited the number of integrins to reduce calculation time . Nevertheless , the wet - lab obser - vation of more activated integrin on pillars than between them can thus also arise in models without a slowdown . Severing by cofilin We compared cofilin regulation directly at ( i . e . , on colli - sion with ) the focal adhesion complex with a short cas - cade with an intermediate signaling entity , CofReg . The amount of active cofilin in the whole system depends on the parameters of the cofilin - regulating reactions ( and the total amount of cofilin ) . With more CofReg ( rCofRe - gAppearance > rCofRegDisappearance , purple markers in Figure 7 ) , only a small fraction is active and filaments grow longer on average , with little CofReg ( rCofRegAppearance < rCofRegDisappearance , blue markers ) , filaments are sev - ered earlier and / or more often . Since we assume that a significant part of the cofilin regulation mechanism happens in regions where the focal adhesion complexes reside , we compared the ratio of active cofilin to total cofilin in the respective regions , i . e . , on and between surface structures ( pillars ) . A small difference can be seen between the respective fraction Bittig etal . BMCSystemsBiology 2014 , 8 : 106 Page 14 of 19 http : / / www . biomedcentral . com / 1752 - 0509 / 8 / 106 for surface structures and for regions between them , also when cofilin ( de ) activation does not depend on an inter - mediate signaling entity ( see Figure 8A ; note that the comparison only makes sense for experiments with pil - lared surface structures , not for planar surfaces ) . This can go so far that there is almost no active cofilin on pil - lars , but at the same time the vast majority of cofilin between pillars is also inactive . This is not an artifact of a skewed overall distribution of cofilin ( e . g . , resulting from accumulation outside pillar regions ; Figure 8B ) . Note that all shown results stem from simulations with the same rate at which deactivated cofilin becomes active again ( rCofilinReactivation ) . With higher or lower values for this rate , the active cofilin ratios can be made higher ( towards the blue markers in Figure 8A ) or lower ( towards the purple markers ) , respectively . Also , the pillared region experiments lead to slightly shorter actin filaments than comparable experiments with a planar surface ( Figure 9 right vs . left ; cf . Tables 2 and 3 ) . As the ratio of active cofilin vs . total cofilin on pillars is roughly equal to the one in comparable pla - nar surface simulations , we attribute the shorter filaments in pillar structure simulations to the higher chance of filaments being cut off between pillars rather than on them . Filament orientation and branching Average filament length is slightly negatively correlated with our parameter angular deviation , which lets the fila - ments grow in similar direction , again when holding other parameters constant . More specifically , here the angle of each filament relative to the horizontal is set to a nor - mally distributed value with mean 0 and a certain standard deviation ( representing orientation dispersion ) . When fil - aments are more closely aligned , they can become slightly longer on average , mostly because when we allow fila - ments to grow in whichever direction they please ( which would be the direction from which the first bound actin approached the original focal integrin ) , they get in each other’s way more often , limiting further growth ( provided the other chosen parameters allow long filaments in principle ) . This could be considered an artifact of the chosen two - dimensional approach , assuming that one fil - ament could simply grow above or below the other for a small segment in a three - dimensional approach . Occurrences of one filament segment preventing fur - ther growth of another one are slightly more frequent in simulations where proteins are allowed to branch , i . e . , where a certain amount of Arp2 / 3 entities are available from the simulation start . Here , overall filament sizes ( when counting all entities in one filament complex , i . e . , all branches of it ) become larger relative to simulations with otherwise equal parameters but only straight filaments , although the longest segment chains in filaments seem shorter on average ( cf . Figure 10 ) . The angular deviation model parameter then has little effect on the orienta - tion dispersion observed in the simulation , as branches always grow with an angle of 70° relative to the filament from which they branch off , leading to differently oriented branches . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 A C o f ili n a c t i v e / t o t a l be t w een p il l a r s Cofilin active / total on pillars 0 . 22 0 . 24 0 . 26 0 . 28 0 . 3 0 . 32 0 0 . 02 0 . 04 0 . 06 0 . 08 0 . 1 0 . 12 0 . 14 0 . 16 0 . 18 0 . 2 Cofilin on pillars / Cofilin anywhere C o f ili n a c t i v e / t o t a l be t w een p ill a r s − C o f ili n a c t i v e / t o t a l on p ill a r s B cofilin regulation by integrin rCofRegApp = 0 . 5 rCofRegDis = 0 . 5 rCofRegApp = 0 . 5 rCofRegDis = 2 . 0 rCofRegApp = 2 . 0 rCofRegDis = 0 . 5 rCofRegApp = 2 . 0 rCofRegDis = 2 . 0 Figure 8 Overrepresentation of active cofilin between pillars due to ( de - ) activation mechanism tied to the focal adhesion complex .

Discussion So far we focussed on the effect of changes to single or few parameters while keeping the others constant . We also found that the “structure parameter” , i . e . , the size of the area where the cell has surface contact and thus where filament growth can start and where the actin depoly - merizing factor ( cofilin ) is regulated , can already explain part of the lower filament length in systems with the pil - lar structure compared to planar surfaces ( Figure 9 left vs right ) .

Wet - lab experiments demonstrated that several of the aforementioned parameters ( e . g . , orientation dispersion and severing agent regulation as exemplified by Rho and vinculin expression ) are different between the two situa - tions , it is more appropriate to compare the planar surface simulations with low dispersion and low severing with the pillar structure simulation with high orientation disper - sion and high severing agent ( cofilin ) activity ( Figure 9 top left vs . bottom right ) . Then , the difference in filament lengths and patterns becomes more pronounced ( see also Table 3 ) . Since we could establish that average filament lengths are sensitive to several parameters , some of which should be different between cells on planar surfaces and those on micro - structured ones , tweaking these parameters in one of the two settings can make the difference between their simulations larger or smaller . Conclusion Our results indicate that sensing mechanisms and bio - chemical regulation of actin filament severing via cofilin might play a central role in explaining the phenotyp - ical differences between osteoblasts grown on planar vs . geometrically micro - structured surfaces , the former due to the apparent concentration of filaments in areas where the cells had surface contact , the latter because of expression differences in regulatory proteins upstream of cofilin .

BMCSystemsBiology 2014 , 8 : 106 Page 17 of 19 http : / / www . biomedcentral . com / 1752 - 0509 / 8 / 106 Based on the wet - lab results , we developed a spatial computational model of actin filament formation with several abstractions that lumped multi - step processes with yet unquantified components into single steps . First , based on a hampered entry of integrin into the pillar structure regions and a subsequent slowdown of integrins , the observation of homogeneously distributed integrin in wet - lab experiments could be reproduced . Subsequent wet - lab experiments then showed that activated integrins are slightly clustered on pillars . In earlier studies , it had already been shown that vinculin can be found strongly clustered on pillars . From both finding , we hypothesized that the focal adhesions , of which vinculin is a part , indeed form predominantly on pillars . The spatial patterns of further selected members of the focal adhesion complex will be analyzed in future stud - ies , also to shed light on their role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton . Our results indicate that filament growth pattern can result from the receptor complex’ role in regulating the actin depolymerizing factor ( ADF ) / cofilin . Due to deactivation of cofilin in the vicinity of focal adhesion complexes ( containing vinculin and activated integrin ) , which were clustered on the pillars , a higher concentration of active cofilin could be found between the pillars in our simulations , which increased the prob - ability of actin filaments being cut off outside the pillar structures . The resulting differences in our simulations , if we assume otherwise identical model parameters ( i . e . , reac - tion rates and actor amounts ) for structured and non - structured surfaces , appear less pronounced than in in vitro observations . However , our findings in wet - lab experiments suggest that these identical model parame - ters are not realistic . e . g . , we find a higher alignment ( i . e . , orientation dispersion ) of actin filaments and higher Rho expressions on planar surfaces . The simulation results for pillar structure surfaces and those for planar sur - faces were even closer to the wet - lab observation if these measured differences were added explicitly to the sim - ulated models , i . e . , orientation dispersion and the reg - ulation parameter for cofilin were adjusted accordingly . The effect of shorter actin filaments on pillared structures compared to planar ones is , however , still more promi - nent in vitro than observed in silico . Therefore , current wet - lab studies are aimed at revealing possible mech - anisms behind , among other things , the differences in orientation dispersion and processes that could induce the release and activation of additional cofilin at the pillared surface . Further potential expansions of our approach include wet - lab experiments to measure concentrations of pro - teins that were lumped together into one model entity here , and the identification of realistic amounts and rate parameters for the reactions included in the model . First experiments indicate that , for example , the concentration of actin is significantly lower in the pillared case , although it remains to be seen whether this is the cause or an indi - rect effect of filaments not being able to grow long . Also the question what lies behind the observed phenomena of different actin alignments and species concentrations like Rho needs further exploration . On the computational side , the rule - based spatial mod - eling approach ML - Space allowed to probe different hypothesis and a successive extension of the model eas - ily . In addition to the particles , their location , spatial extension , Brownian movement and reaction , the model explicitly includes the surface structures by exploiting the hierarchical nesting in ML - Space . The approach can be expanded to allow for movement of bound entities together , i . e . , filaments , instead of fixing their position in the event of binding , to find ways of representing the cel - lular stress to be the source of orientation alignment , and to speed up the simulation to allow more simulation runs with more realistic protein sizes and consequently many more proteins in the system .
