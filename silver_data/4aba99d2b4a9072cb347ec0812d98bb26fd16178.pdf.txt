Here , we show that the myopodin sequence 58 KKRRRRARK 66 , when tagged to either enhanced green ﬂuo - rescent protein ( EGFP ) or to enhanced cyan ﬂuorescent pro - tein - CapG ( ECFPCapG ) , is able to target these proteins to the nucleolus in HeLa or HEK293T cells . By contrast , 58 KKRR 61 - ECFP - CapG accumulates in the nucleus . Mutation of 58 KKRRRRARK 66 into alanine residues blocks myopodin nucle - ar import and promotes formation of cytoplasmic actin ﬁla - ments . A second putative nuclear localization sequence , 612 KTSKKKGKK 620 , displays much weaker activity in a heterol - ogous context , and appears not to be functional in the full length protein . Thus myopodin nuclear translocation is dependent on a monopartite nuclear localization sequence . (cid:1) 2005 Federation of European Biochemical Societies . Published by Elsevier B . V .

Introduction Many physiological processes like cell migration , adhesion , division and development are accompanied by cytoskeletal rearrangements , and occur by virtue of actin binding proteins [ 1 ] that reversibly organize actin monomers into ﬁlamentous structures . Within this large group of actin binding proteins , many of which are expressed simultaneously in eukaryotic cells , actin bundling proteins take up a prominent role by cross - linking ﬁlaments into tight bundles allowing cells to per - form distinct functions . In recent years , there has been a noticeable trend towards research focusing on nuclear actin binding proteins . Nucleocytoplasmic protein traﬃcking occurs through nucle - ar pore complexes embedded in the nuclear membrane , and is mediated by transport receptors called importins and expor - tins . These in turn recognize transport signals in their cargoes known as nuclear localization signals and nuclear export sig - nals [ 2 , 3 ] , resulting in translocation through the nuclear pore complex via interaction with nucleoporins , the basic constitu - ents of the nuclear pore complex . Actin binding proteins such as CapG [ 4 , 5 ] , plastins / ﬁmbrins [ 6 ] , proﬁlin [ 7 , 8 ] , thymosin [ 9 ] , supervillin [ 10 ] and Flightless I [ 11 ] , among others , have been observed to shuttle between the cytoplasm and nucleus of eukaryotic cells . While it is not entirely clear in each case which role ( s ) these proteins perform in the nucleus , is has been shown that some of them can modulate gene transcription controlled by steroid hormone receptors [ 12 , 13 ] . Myopodin is an actin bundling protein that shuttles between nucleus and cytoplasm in a diﬀerentiation - dependent manner in muscle cells ; its nuclear localization in myoblasts shifts to the cytoplasm and Z - disc as muscle cells diﬀerentiate into myo - tubes [ 14 ] . Myopodin is also expressed in other tissues and ( cancer ) cells [ 15 , 16 ] where it localizes to the nucleus and cyto - plasm . We identiﬁed a weak nuclear export sequence in myo - podin that is able to export an otherwise nuclear protein [ 5 ] but as such little is known about myopodin key sequences that control its nuclear import . Here we show that this is regulated by a monopartite nuclear localization sequence ( NLS ) . 2 . Materials and methods 2 . 1 .

All constructs were veriﬁed by sequencing . The EGFP - b - gal construct was generously provided by Prof . Dr . M . Bollen ( Division of Biochemistry , KU Leuven , Bel - gium ) . CapG in the pECFP - C1 vector ( BD Biosciences Clontech ) was adapted for gateway cloning [ 17 ] . 2 . 3 . Cell culture and transfection HEK293T cells and HeLa cells were maintained as described [ 18 ] . HeLa cells were transiently transfected using lipofectamine reagent ( Invitrogen , Merelbeke , Belgium ) according to the manufacturer (cid:1) s instructions . HEK293T cells , seeded on rat tail collagen - coated cover - slips , were transfected using calcium phosphate . HeLa cells were incu - bated with 0 . 2 l M cytochalasin D starting at 8 h post - transfection for 16 h . Subsequently , the cells were processed for ﬂuorescence micros - copy . Quantiﬁcation of nucleocytoplasmic distribution of fusion pro - teins was performed by scoring 100 cells ( cytoplasmic only , or cytoplasmic and nuclear ) . Experiments were performed in triplicate . Mean values and S . D . were calculated . Axiovision 4 . 4 software ( Zeiss , Go¨ttingen ) was used to calculate the ratio of nuclear ﬂuorescence ver - sus cytoplasmic ﬂuorescence in transfected cells . 2 . 4 . Fluorescence microscopy and immunocytochemistry Staining of cells and ﬂuorescence microscopy were performed as de - scribed [ 6 ] .

Miscellaneous Lysis of cells and Western blot analysis were performed as described [ 20 ] . Proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence detec - tion ( ECL , Amersham Pharmacia Biotech , Buckinghamshire , UK ) . Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford [ 21 ] using bovine serum albumin as a standard . 3 . Results 3 . 1 . Myopodin deletion fragments exhibit a diﬀerential localization in cells A previous study [ 14 ] showed that two putative nuclear localization signals of myopodin , 58 KKRR 61 and 616 KKGK 619 , were not functional because mutation of two ly - sine residues in these sequences ( 58 AARR 61 ; 616 AAGK 619 ) did not aﬀect the localization of the actin binding protein . Initially , we studied nuclear targeting of myopodin in various cell types using enhanced green ﬂuorescent protein ( EGFP ) - tagged trun - cation variants of myopodin ( Fig . 1A ) . Full length myopodin - EGFP localized to the nucleus and cytoplasm ( also onto actin stress ﬁbers ) following expression in HeLa cells , but stronger nuclear enrichment was observed in HEK293T cells ( Fig . 1B ) . The myopodin fragment 56 M – P 432 , tagged to EGFP , lacks the nuclear export sequence 3 P – L 24 [ 5 ] and localized to the nucleus and cytoplasm in HeLa or HEK293T cells ( Fig . 1C ) . Nuclear entry by passive diﬀusion of this fusion pro - tein is unlikely because its molecular mass exceeds 60 kDa , which is above the limit for passive diﬀusion [ 22 ] . By contrast , expression of myopodin 219 M – E 758 - EGFP promoted a subcel - lular distribution in HeLa cells consisting of a ﬁber - like pattern in the cytoplasm , due to association with actin ﬁlaments ( Fig . 1D , left ) . No nuclear enrichment of this myopodin trun - cation mutant was observed in HEK293T cells either ( Fig . 1D , right ) . Expression of these constructs was conﬁrmed by Wes - tern blotting ( Fig . 1E ) , and quantiﬁcation of data for HeLa cells is depicted in Fig . 1F . The nuclear localization of myopo - din - EGFP constructs in HEK293T cells was observed in close to 100 % of the cells . Full length myopodin - EGFP and myopo - din 56 M – P 432 - EGFP displayed a nuclear / cytoplasmic ratio of 1 . 66 and 1 . 56 ( arbitrary units ) , respectively , while the ratio of myopodin 219 M – E 758 - EGFP was 0 . 70 . These ﬁndings strongly suggest that the myopodin fragment 56 M – Q 218 har - bors a nuclear targeting sequence . 3 . 2 . Nuclear / nucleolar shuttling of reporter proteins by myopodin targeting sequences Thorough analysis of the amino acid sequence of the 56 M – Q 218 myopodin fragment revealed only one potential mono - partite NLS , 58 KKRRRRARK 66 ( (cid:2) NLS1 (cid:1) ) , that overlaps with the putative NLS previously reported by Weins et al . [ 14 ] ( 58 KKRR 61 ) . Surprisingly , when the sequence 58 KKRRRR - ARK 66 ( NLS1 ) was coupled to EGFP , we noticed strong enrichment in nucleoli of HEK293T and HeLa cells , suggest - ing that this region could act as a nucleolar targeting sequence ( Fig . 2A , top panel ) . This ﬁnding led us to re - investigate the equally ineﬀective 616 KKGK 619 NLS2 sequence in a broader context . Coupling of 612 KTSKKKGKK 620 ( (cid:2) NLS2 (cid:1) ) to EGFP also promoted nucleolar targeting ( Fig . 2A , bottom panel ) . Be - cause EGFP shows a strong tendency to accumulate in the nucleus through passive diﬀusion , the myopodin 58 KKRRRR - ARK 66 / 612 KTSKKKGKK 620 sequences were also tagged to enhanced cyan ﬂuorescent protein ( ECFP ) - CapG , a 67 kDa fusion protein that is not enriched in the nucleus when the ﬂuo - rescent protein is tagged to the amino terminus of CapG ( Fig . 2B , left panels ) . We observed nucleolar ﬂuorescence for myopodin NLS1 - ECFP - CapG in various cell types , as evi - denced by co - staining with the nucleolar marker nucleophos - min ( B23 ) ( Fig . 2B ) . These ﬁndings were conﬁrmed by confocal microscopy ( data not shown ) . By contrast , 612 KTSKKKGKK 620 ( NLS2 ) - tagged ECFP - CapG remained entirely cytoplasmic ( data not shown ) . As mutation of both ly - sine residues in the sequence 58 KKRR 61 did not aﬀect myopo - din localization [ 14 ] , we coupled all four residues 58 KKRR 61 to ECFP - CapG and compared its targeting activity to 58 KKRRRRARK 66 . Interestingly , this fusion protein exhib - ited strong ﬂuorescence in the nucleus , but not in the nucleolus ( Fig . 3A ) . Myopodin NLS1 , NLS2 or the 58 KKRR 61 sequence were also expressed as a fusion protein with EGFP - b - gal , resulting in a large tetrameric polypeptide of > 500 kDa . In HeLa or HEK293T cells we noted that both myopodin NLS1 and the 58 KKRR 61 sequence strongly enhanced nuclear , but not nucleolar , accumulation of EGFP - b - gal . NLS2 was unable to target EGFP - b - gal to the nucleus ( Fig . 3B ) . As such our ﬁndings suggest that 58 KKRRRRARK 66 and 58 KKRR 61 can be classiﬁed as a strong NLS while 612 KTSKKKGKK 620 is unable to target medium size or large proteins autonomously to the nucleus . 3 . 3 . Mutation of the myopodin sequence 58 KKRRRRARK 66 prevents nuclear targeting and promotes cytoplasmic actin ﬁlament association The role of both NLS1 and NLS2 in regulating the localiza - tion of myopodin was investigated by mutating all basic amino acids into alanine ( 58 KKRRRRARK 66 to 58 AAAAAAAAA 66 for NLS1 and 612 KTSKKKGKK 620 to 612 ATSAAAGAA 620 for NLS2 ) , rather than deleting them as this could disturb the structure of myopodin more profoundly , and therefore hamper interaction with other proteins . Because myopodin shows a strong tendency to associate with actin stress ﬁbers 6674 A . De Ganck et al . / FEBS Letters 579 ( 2005 ) 6673 – 6680 ( see Fig . 1A ) , we treated HeLa cells with 0 . 2 l M cytochalasin D ( see Section 2 ) . This promoted disruption of actin stress ﬁ - bers ( not shown ) but facilitated myopodin nuclear entry , thus allowing a more balanced comparison with HEK293T cells . Expression in HeLa or HEK293T cells of a myopodin cDNA in which NLS2 was mutated ( Myo NLS2Ala ) did not promote a signiﬁcant change in subcellular localization ( Fig . 4A , com - pare with wild type ) : Myo NLS2Ala predominantly stained the nucleus in HEK293T cells , as did the wild type protein . Similarly , wild type myopodin and Myo NLS2Ala stained the nucleus and short actin ﬁbers in HeLa cells ( Fig . 4A ) . By contrast , Myo NLS1Ala no longer localized to the nucleus in HeLa or HEK293T cells , and promoted formation of extended actin ﬁlaments or actin loops in 46 ± 3 . 9 % of HEK293T cells observed ( Fig . 4B , upper panels , arrowheads ) . Confocal microscopy conﬁrmed co - localization between actin ﬁlaments and Myo NLS1Ala ( data not shown ) .

Simulta - neous mutation of all basic amino acids of both NLS1 and NLS2 ( Myo NLS1 + 2Ala ) showed a phenotype similar to Myo NLS1Ala ( Fig . 4C ) , and 44 ± 4 . 0 % of HEK293T cells exhibited cytoplasmic actin loops . Mutation in myopodin of the ﬁrst four basic residues of NLS1 ( 58 KKRR 61 – 58 AAAA 61 ) also prevented nuclear entry of myopodin , nearly as eﬃciently as NLS1 ( Fig . 4D ) . It is not clear at present why cytoplasmic actin ﬁlaments were observed in a smaller number of cells here ( 10 ± 5 % ) . Quantiﬁcation of these data is shown in Fig . 5 . Ta - ken together , our ﬁndings indicate that NLS1 is necessary and suﬃcient to regulate subcellular targeting of myopodin in cells , with 58 KKRR 61 representing the minimal fragment . 4 . Conclusion We have presented evidence that myopodin harbors a single regulatory sequence required to target the protein to the nu - cleus . Mutation of 58 KKRRRRARK 66 ( NLS1 ) or 58 KKRR 61 is necessary and suﬃcient to prevent nuclear accumulation of myopodin . Of note , p73 [ 23 ] , a member of the p53 family of proteins , and the ubiquitin - activating enzyme [ 24 ] are also tar - geted to the nucleus via a KKRR sequence . However the KKRR sequence of the IL - 1 a propiece is required but not suf - ﬁcient to localize it to the nucleus [ 25 ] . Using ﬂuorescent reporter proteins with molecular masses ranging from small to large sizes we have demonstrated that myopodin 58 KKRRRRARK 66 targets ECFP - CapG to nucle - oli whereas the shorter sequence 58 KKRR 61 translocates ECFP - CapG to nuclei . This ﬁnding is reminiscent of the NF - j B inducing kinase NIK , a protein that harbors a se - quence 143 RKKRKKK 149 targeting NIK to nucleoli when nu - clear export sequences of the kinase are deleted [ 26 ] . By contrast , NIK 143 AAAAKKK 149 prevents translocation into nucleoli while retaining its nuclear accumulation . Although unexpected , it is not unprecedented that nuclear localization sequences fail to mediate nuclear / nucleolar accu - mulation of large carrier molecules like beta - galactosidase in contrast to small or medium size reporter proteins . Indeed , in this respect our ﬁnding that NLS1 translocates ECFP - CapG to nucleoli but not EGFP - b - gal , is similar to that reported for Fig . 2 . Nuclear and nucleolar targeting of heterologous proteins by myopodin NLS1 or NLS2 . ( A ) Myopodin NLS1 - EGFP or NLS2 - EGFP accumulate in nucleoli of HeLa and HEK293T cells . ( B ) The cytoplasmic localization of ECFP - CapG in HEK293T , HeLa or C2C12 cells ( left panels ) shifts to nucleoli when ECFP - CapG is tagged with myopodin NLS1 , as evidenced by anti - B23 staining . Bar = 20 l m . 6676 A . De Ganck et al . / FEBS Letters 579 ( 2005 ) 6673 – 6680 the NLS from angiogenin ( a potent inducer of angiogenesis ) [ 27 ] , HIV - Tat [ 28 ] and mouse upstream binding factor [ 29 ] . It is diﬃcult to gauge at present whether the myopodin nucleolar targeting sequences are physiologically relevant . However , although myopodin is a genuine dynamic shuttling protein , changing its localization during diﬀerentiation from nucleus to cytoplasm / actin ﬁbers , but apparently absent from nucleoli , a nucleolar localization of endogenous or overexpres - sed myopodin can be clearly discerned in various bladder can - cer cell lines [ 16 ] . Since myopodin NLS2 is able to target EGFP , but not ECFP - CapG or EGFP - b - galactosidase to nucleoli , we cannot rule out at present that this sequence may contribute to nucleolar localization of myopodin ( i . e . , during speciﬁc stages of diﬀerentiation or in cancer cells ) . This would be similar to the human ribosomal L7a protein where nucleolar targeting requires a basic domain represented by an NLS or a stretch of basic amino acids without NLS activity , in addition to another domain [ 30 ] . Our ﬁndings are at variance with a recent report showing that deletion in myopodin of either 58 KKRR 61 or of 616 KKGKK 620 prevents its translocation to the nucleus [ 31 ] , suggesting that myopodin contains two nuclear localization se - quences . However , these authors also observed that mutation of two basic residues in these sequences has no eﬀect on myo - podin localization [ 14 ] . We consider it not unlikely that delet - ing these sequences aﬀects the overall structure and biological properties of myopodin more severely than mutating them . While the function of myopodin in the nucleus remains un - clear at present , recent studies have shown that several ( cyto - plasmic ) actin binding proteins are able to enter the nucleus transiently , and modulate transactivation activity of various nuclear steroid receptors ( reviewed in [ 13 ] ) . For instance , a - ac - tinin2 ( a bona ﬁde actin crosslinking protein ) enhances andro - gen receptor activity , most likely through its LXXLL motif [ 32 ] , a signature sequence typical of receptor coactivators [ 33 ] . Since myopodin also contains an LXXLL motif ( 372 LLSLL 376 ) we speculate that nuclear receptors could repre - sent a target for nuclear myopodin . Alternatively , nuclear myopodin could modulate gene transcription by regulating the interaction between actin and RNA polymerase II . Indeed , nuclear actin is a component of the RNA polymerase II - con - taining preinitiation complex [ 34 ] and as such indispensable Fig . 3 .

( B ) Myopodin NLS1 or the 58 KKRR 61 NLS1 fragment directs EGFP - b - gal to the nuclei of HeLa or HEK293T cells , but not to nucleoli ; NLS2 is unable to mimick this eﬀect . Bar = 20 l m . A .
