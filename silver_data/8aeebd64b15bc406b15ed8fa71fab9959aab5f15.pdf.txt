Activation of RhoA has been shown to be an essential part of the signaling mechanism of these proteins . Here we report an additional signal , which determines whether these proteins promote or inhibit axon outgrowth . Myelin - associated glycoprotein ( MAG ) and Nogo trigger the intracellular elevation of Ca 2 (cid:1) as well as the activation of PKC , presumably mediated by G i / G . Neurite outgrowth inhibition and growth cone collapse by MAG or Nogo can be converted to neurite extension and growth cone spreading by inhibiting conventional PKC , but not by inhibiting inositol 1 , 4 , 5 - triphosphate ( IP 3 ) . Conversely , neurite growth of immature neurons promoted by MAG is abolished by inhibiting IP 3 . Activation of RhoA is independent of PKC . Thus , a balance between PKC and IP 3 is important for bidirectional regulation of axon regeneration by the myelin - derived proteins . Key words : p75 ; myelin ; myelin - derived proteins ; G - protein ; PKC ; spinal Introduction Three distinct myelin proteins , myelin - associated glycoprotein ( MAG ) , Nogo , and oligodendrocyte myelin glycoprotein , inhibit axon growth by binding to a common receptor , the Nogo recep - tor ( McKerracher and Winton , 2002 ) . Because the Nogo receptor is glycoslyphosphatidylinositol - linked to the cell surface and does not have an intracellular signaling domain , it plays a role as a binding partner for the myelin proteins . Recently , p75 NTR in complex with the Nogo receptor has been shown to be a signal - transducing element for these proteins ( Wang et al . , 2002 ; Wong et al . , 2002 ; Yamashita et al . , 2002 ) . One potential clue to under - standing the signal transduction mechanism involved is found through observations demonstrating that the small GTPase Rho is a key intracellular effector for growth inhibitory signaling by myelin . In its active GTP - bound form , Rho rigidifies the actin cytoskeleton , thereby inhibiting axon elongation and mediating growth cone collapse ( Davies , 2000 ; Schmidt and Hall , 2002 ) . RhoA , a member of the Rho GTPases family , is activated by MAG , Nogo , and oligodendrocyte myelin glycoprotein through a p75 NTR - dependent mechanism , thus inhibiting neurite out - growth from postnatal sensory neurons and cerebellar neurons ( Wang et al . , 2002 ; Yamashita et al . , 2002 ) . Regulation of RhoA activity by MAG and Nogo through p75 NTR is mediated by the release of RhoA from Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor ( GDI ) , which suppresses the activity of RhoA ( Yamashita and Tohyama , 2003 ) . Although RhoA seems to play a key role in regulating axon growth , we were interested in the possibility that some other signals also may influence the effects of the myelin - derived inhib - itors . An intriguing observation is that MAG promotes axon growth from dorsal root ganglion ( DRG ) neurons of rats up to postnatal day 4 ( P4 ) ( Johnson et al . , 1989 ; Mukhopadhyay et al . , 1994 ) . This finding lead to the possibility that the myelin - derived proteins are bifunctional molecules inhibiting or promoting axon regeneration . To test this hypothesis , we examined other signals that may be regulated by these proteins . Here we report a new signal , which determines whether these proteins promote or inhibit axon outgrowth or growth cone spreading . MAG and Nogo trigger the intracellular elevation of Ca 2 (cid:1) as well as the activation of PKC . Neurite outgrowth inhibi - tion and growth cone collapse by MAG or Nogo can be converted to neurite extension and growth cone spreading by inhibiting conventional PKC . Conversely , neurite growth of immature neu - rons promoted by MAG is abolished by inhibiting inositol 1 , 4 , 5 - triphosphate ( IP 3 ) . A balance between PKC and IP 3 is suggested to be a key factor for bidirectional regulation of axon regenera - tion by the myelin - derived proteins . Materials and Methods Calcium imaging .

Hank’s MEM was used to prevent pH changes during experiments . The antibody against the extracellular domain of p75 NTR was added 2 hr before imaging , and U73122 ( 50 n M ) , U73343 ( 50 n M ) , or pertussis toxin ( PTX ) ( 20 ng / ml ) was added 30 min before imaging . The cells were illuminated with 488 nm light from an argon laser . Fluores - cence images for the entire cell body were used for ratiometric calcium measurements . Fura Red and Oregon Green emission signals were col - lected at 605 – 700 and 500 – 560 nm , respectively , and analyzed at 10 sec intervals . The Oregon Green / Fura Red ratio was calculated by dividing pixel values at 530 nm by those at 640 nm . MAG – Fc chimera ( R & D Systems , Minneapolis , MN ) or human Siglec - 3 - Fc chimera ( R & D Sys - tems ) was used at the concentration of 25 (cid:1) g / ml . The number of the cells examined is 70 – 120 for each experimental group ( five to seven indepen - dent experiments were done for each ) . Assessment of PKC activities . PKC assays were performed using the PepTag assay kit for nonradioactive detection of protein kinase C system ( Promega , Madison , WI ) . Serum - starved cultured cerebellar cells were stimulated by MAG – Fc ( 25 (cid:1) g / ml ) and the Nogo peptide ( 4 (cid:1) M ; Alpha Diagnostic , San Antonio , TX ) in the presence or absence of PTX ( 20 ng / ml ) . The inhibitors at the indicated concentration have been shown previously to be effective in enhancing the Rho activity as well as neurite inhibition ( Tang et al . , 1997b ; Yamashita et al . , 2002 ; Yamashita and Tohyama , 2003 ) . Each sample was incubated with the PKC substrate PepTagC1peptide ( 2 (cid:1) g ) at30°Cfor30min . Thesampleswereseparated on a 0 . 8 % agarose gel at 100 V for 15 min . Phosphorylated peptide substrate migrated toward the anode ( (cid:1) ) , whereas nonphosphorylated peptide substrate migrated toward the cathode ( (cid:2) ) . The gel was photo - graphed on a transilluminator . For assessment of phosphorylated PKC , phosphospecific antibodies were used . The cells were lysed with 0 . 1 % NP - 40 containing 10 m M Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 5 , 150 m M NaCl , 10 % glycerol , 100 m M sodium or - thovanadate , 50 m M sodium fluoride , 5 m M sodium pyrophosphate , 1 m M EGTA , and protease inhibitor mixture ( Roche Biochemicals ) . The lysates were subjected to SDS - PAGE , followed by immunoblot analysis . Polyclonal anti - phospho PKC - (cid:2) ( Ser 657 ; Upstate Biotechnology , Char - lottesville , VA ) , phospho - PKC - (cid:3) / (cid:4) ( Cell Signaling Technology , Beverly , MA ) , and PKC (cid:2) ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA ) antibodies were used . In other sets of experiments , the lysates were incubated with anti - PKC - (cid:2) , - PKC - (cid:5) 1 , or - PKC - (cid:5) 2 ( all from Santa Cruz Biotechnol - ogy ) , followedbyincubationwithproteinG – Sepharose ( AmershamBio - sciences , Arlington Heights , IL ) for 2 hr at 4°C . The beads were washed three times and subjected to SDS - PAGE , followed by immunoblot anal - ysis . Western blotting was done using the antibody against phosphory - lated pan - PKC ( Cell Signaling Technology ) . Specificity of antibodies against PKC - (cid:5) 1 or PKC - (cid:5) 2 has been described in multiple references ( Miranti et al . , 1999 ) . Anti - PKC - (cid:2) antibody reacts with PKC - (cid:2) and very weakly with PKC - (cid:5) 1 and - (cid:5) 2 . Anti - PKC - (cid:5) 1 and - PKC - (cid:5) 2 are specific to corresponding isoform . Neurite outgrowth assay . Dorsal root ganglia were removed from P1 rats and dissociated into single cells by incubation with 0 . 025 % trypsin ( Sigma , St . Louis , MO ) for 15 min at 37°C . For cerebellar neurons , the cerebella from two animals ( both P7 rats ) were combined in 5 ml of 0 . 025 % trypsin , triturated , and incubated for 10 min at 37°C . DMEM containing 10 % FCS was added , and the cells were centrifuged at 800 rpm . Neurons were plated in Sato media ( Doherty et al . , 1990 ) on poly - L - lysine - coated chamber slides . For outgrowth assays , plated cells were incubated for 24 hr , fixed in 4 % ( weight per volume ) paraformaldehyde , and immunostained with a monoclonal antibody ( TuJ1 ) for the purpose of recognizing the neuron - specific (cid:5) - tubulin III protein . The length of the longest neurite or the total process outgrowth for each (cid:5) - tubulin III - positive neuron was then determined . For each experiment , we mea - sured at least 100 neurites length and repeated the same experiments three times . Where indicated , MAG – Fc ( 25 (cid:1) g / ml ) , the Nogo peptide ( 4 (cid:1) M ) , PTX ( 2 ng / ml ; Sigma ) , U73122 ( 20 n M ; Sigma ) , Xestspongin C ( XestC ) ( 1 (cid:1) M ; Sigma ) , the cell - permeable PKC inhibitor 20 – 28 ( 2 (cid:1) M ; Calbiochem , La Jolla , CA ) , G 0 6976 ( 200 n M ; Sigma ) , or myristoylated PKC (cid:6) pseudosubstrate ( 2 (cid:1) M ; Sigma ) was added to the medium after plating . Growth cone collapse assay . Explants of embryonic day 12 ( E12 ) chick dorsal root ganglion were incubated for 24 hr on plastic slides precoated with 100 (cid:1) g / ml poly - L - lysine and treated for 30 min with soluble CNS myelin extracts ( Sigma ) at the indicated concentrations , MAG – Fc ( 25 (cid:1) g / ml ) or the Nogo peptide ( 4 (cid:1) M ) . Explants were fixed in 4 % ( w / v ) para - formaldehydeandstainedwithfluorescence - labeledphalloidin ( Sigma ) . For eachexperiment , weassessedatleast100growthcones , andwerepeatedthe same experiments three times . Affinity precipitation of GTP – RhoA . Cells were lysed in 50 m M Tris , pH 7 . 5 , containing 1 % Triton X - 100 , 0 . 5 % sodium deoxycholate , 0 . 1 % SDS , 500 m M NaCl , and 10 m M MgCl 2 , with leupeptin and aprotinin , each at 10 (cid:1) g / ml ( Renetal . , 1999 ) . Celllysateswereclarifiedbycentrifugationat 13 , 000 (cid:3) g at 4°C for 10 min , and the supernatants were incubated with 20 (cid:1) g of GST – Rho binding domain of Rhotekin beads ( Upstate Biotech - nology ) at 4°C for 45 min . The beads were washed four times with a washing buffer ( 50 m M Tris , pH 7 . 5 , containing 1 % Triton X - 100 , 150 m M NaCl , 10 m M MgCl 2 , and 10 (cid:1) g / ml each of leupeptin and aprotinin ) .

Results Phospholipase C – PKC / IP 3 pathways are activated by MAG and Nogo It has been shown previously that MAG induces a rise in intracel - lular Ca 2 (cid:1) concentration in cultured Xenopus spinal neurons ( Wong et al . , 2002 ) and that MAG - dependent repulsion of ax - onalgrowthconesrequiresCa 2 (cid:1) signaling ( Songetal . , 1998 ) . We confirmed these findings through a series of experiments using cerebellar neurons from P7 rats . Fluorescence imaging using the Ca 2 (cid:1) - sensitive dyes Oregon Green 488 BAPTA - 1 and Fura Red showed that the cytosolic Ca 2 (cid:1) was significantly elevated in the soma of the cells within 1 min after the addition of MAG – Fc to themedium ( Fig . 1 a – c ) . WewereunabletomonitorCa 2 (cid:1) signals on the neurites because of the limited amount of fluorescent dyes loadedintothesesmallcerebellarcellneurites ( Xiangetal . , 2002 ) . The rapid and massive Ca 2 (cid:1) elevation we observed in the cere - bellar neurons is different from the previous observation using Xenopus spinal neurons , for which the Ca 2 (cid:1) increase was mild ( Wong et al . , 2002 ) . This may be attributable to the fact that our imaging was performed in the cell bodies , whereas Wong et al . ( 2002 ) observed the growth cones . No increase in the intracellu - larCa 2 (cid:1) wasobservedbyhumanSiglec - 3 - Fc , oneofthemembers of the Ig superfamily ( Fig . 1 c ) . Results showed that the Ca 2 (cid:1) elevation was blocked by U73122 , an inhibitor of phospholipase C ( PLC ) , but not by U73343 ( Fig . 1 c ) . Because PLC is a major downstream effector of G i , a heterotrimeric GTP - binding pro - tein , in neurons , intracellular Ca 2 (cid:1) elevation may be dependent on the activation of G i – PLC . Involvement of the G i pathway is suggested by the observation that MAG blocks neurotrophin - induced cAMP accumulation ( Cai et al . , 1999 ) , which is attenu - ated by PTX , an inhibitor of the G i and G 0 proteins . These results suggest that the G - proteins activated by MAG inhibit accumula - tion of cAMP . Indeed , the increase in the Ca 2 (cid:1) concentration by MAG – Fc was attenuated by PTX as well ( Fig . 1 c ) . As reported previously ( Wong et al . , 2002 ) , elevation of Ca 2 (cid:1) by MAG – Fc was inhibited by the antibody against the extracellular domain of p75 NTR ( data not shown ) , thereby demonstrating that p75 NTR participates in the Ca 2 (cid:1) signal . These findings not only confirm the previous results but also suggest that G i – PLC is activated by MAG . Activation of PLC leads to the hydrolysis of phosphatidylino - sitol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PIP 2 ) and produces two cytoplasmic sec - ond messengers ( Berridge , 1998 ) : diacylglycerol ( DAG ) and IP 3 . PKC activation results from the production of DAG together with the elevation of Ca 2 (cid:1) because of IP 3 - sensitive Ca 2 (cid:1) release Hasegawaetal . • AxonExtensionbyMAGandNogo J . Neurosci . , July28 , 2004 • 24 ( 30 ) : 6826 – 6832 • 6827 from internal stores . These results prompted us to examine whether PKC is involved in MAG or Nogo signaling in cerebellar neurons . When cultured cells were treated for 5 min with 25 (cid:1) g / ml MAG or a 4 (cid:1) M concentration of the Nogo peptide , the PKC activity was significantly increased ( Fig . 2 a ) . Activation of PKC by MAG – Fc or the Nogo peptide was prevented by 20 ng / ml PTX . These results suggest the activation of the MAG - or Nogo - mediated G i pathways , which in turn trigger PKC activation as well as IP 3 receptor activation . Our results are consistent with data published very recently ( Sivasankaran et al . , 2004 ) showing the activation of PKC by anti - phospho - PAN - PKC antibody . PKC - (cid:2) , - (cid:5) 1 , - (cid:5) 2 , and - (cid:7) are expressed as conventional PKC in postnatal cerebellar neurons ( data not shown ) . Western blot analysis revealed a significant increase in phosphorylation of PKC - (cid:2) at Ser 657 by MAG – Fc , whereas protein levels of PKC - (cid:2) were not significantly changed ( Fig . 2 b ) . However , experiments using phosphospecific antibodies showed that some of atypical PKCs , PKC - (cid:3) / (cid:4) , were not phosphorylated by MAG ( data not shown ) . To explore further isoform specific activation of conven - tional PKC , we immunoprecipitated each isoform of conventional PKC with the specific antibodies and immunoblotted with pan - phospho PKC antibody . Results showed that PKC - (cid:2) , - (cid:5) 1 , and - (cid:5) 2 were activated by MAG – Fc ( Fig . 2 c ) . These results demonstrate that conventional PKCs are activated by MAG – Fc . Promotion of neurite outgrowth by MAG and Nogo when PKC is inhibited We next examined whether the G i pathway is associated with the effects of MAG or Nogo on the neurite outgrowth . It was shown that soluble MAG , released in abundance from myelin and found in vivo , and MAG – Fc could inhibit axon growth ( Tang et al . , 1997a , b ) . MAG – Fc at 25 (cid:1) g / ml inhibited neurite outgrowth of cerebellar neurons from P7 rats ( Fig . 3 a ) . Fc had no effect on the neurons ( data not shown ) . The exact same results were obtained regardless of whether total process outgrowth or length of the longest neurite was measured ( data not shown ) . The Nogo pep - tide ( 4 (cid:1) M ) also significantly inhibited the neurite outgrowth ( Fig . 3 a ) . However , neither PTX nor U73122 modulated the ac - tion of MAG – Fc or the Nogo peptide ( Fig . 3 a ) . These results Figure1 .

There are two divergent signaling cascades downstream of PLC activation : the PKC and IP 3 pathways . Therefore , we tested the hypothesis that a balance of the two signals may have an effect on these inhibitors . The involvement of PKC in the function of MAG and Nogo was assessed first . Surprisingly , MAG – Fc and the Nogo peptide dramatically stimulated neurite outgrowth in the presence of a specific membrane - permeable inhibitor of PKC - (cid:2) and - (cid:5) , although the PKC inhibitor itself had no effect on the growth ( Fig . 3 b , c ) . PKC activity was blocked by the inhibitor ( Fig . 3 d ) . The extent of neurite outgrowth induced by MAG – Fc or the Nogo peptide was found to be approximately twice as much as that in the control condition . Myristoylated PKC (cid:6) pseudosub - strate did not modulate the effect of MAG – Fc or the Nogo pep - tide ( Fig . 3 c ) . The neurite length induced by MAG – Fc and the PKC inhibitor returned to that with MAG – Fc alone , when per - tussis toxin or XestC was added together with the PKC inhibitor ( Fig . 3 c ) . The same results as the PKC inhibitor were obtained when G 0 6976 , another inhibitor of PKC - (cid:2) , - (cid:5) , and - (cid:8) , was used ( Fig . 3 c ) . Although our data show that G 0 6976 promoted neurite outgrowth in the presence of soluble MAG – Fc , Sivasankaran et al . ( 2004 ) dem - onstrated that G 0 6976 abolished the neu - rite inhibitory effect of the MAG – Fc sub - strate . Different observations of the effects of G 0 6976 , which should be elucidated in the future , might be attributable to the cul - ture conditions : soluble MAG – Fc in our assay and MAG as a substrate in their as - say . These data show bidirectional regula - tion of neurite elongation by MAG and Nogo , which is dependent on the activity of conventional PKC . Growth cone spreading by myelin - derived inhibitors To confirm the neurite growth assay data , we adopted another assay to test the func - tion of MAG or Nogo - 66 . Chick E12 DRG neurons are known to respond to MAG or Nogo - 66 ( Fournier et al . , 2001 ) . We used chick E12 DRG explants to monitor the effects of MAG – Fc and the Nogo peptide on neuronal growth cones . Bath applica - tions of MAG – Fc ( 25 (cid:1) g / ml ) or the Nogo peptide ( 4 (cid:1) M ) exhibited significant growth cone - collapsing activity ( Fig . 4 a , b ) . Consistentwiththedataobtainedby the neurite outgrowth assays , MAG – Fc and the Nogo peptide enhanced the spreading of growth cones in the presence of the PKC inhibitor compared with the control . Although purified myelin from bovine white matter elicited growth cone collapse at 0 . 1 – 10 ng / (cid:1) l , the PKC inhibitor completely reversed the effects mediated by myelin ( Fig . 4 b ) . These findings suggest that MAG , Nogo , and myelin inhibit neu - rite outgrowth and elicit growth cone col - lapse by activating PKC , whereas promo - tion of neurite outgrowth and spreading of growth cones by these inhibitors are mediated by a mechanism that is independent of PKC . Considering that the inhibition of G i or PLC did not result in the modulation of the effects mediated by MAG or Nogo , a balancing mechanism of two pathways , diverg - ing at a point downstream of heterotrimeric G i and PLC , may determine whether these inhibitors promote or inhibit neurite outgrowth as well as growth cone spreading . Dependence on PLC – PKC / IP 3 pathways Because our data demonstrate that conventional PKC is involved in the effects of myelin - derived inhibitors , we next focused on IP 3 , another signal downstream of G i and PLC . To test whether the IP 3 pathway mediates the effect of MAG and Nogo , we bath - applied XestC , an inhibitor of the IP 3 receptor . The increase in the Ca 2 (cid:1) concentration by MAG – Fc was attenuated by XestC ( Fig . 1 c ) . In contrast to the PKC inhibitor , neurite outgrowth inhibition by MAG – Fc or the Nogo peptide in cerebellar neurons was enhanced further by XestC ( Fig . 5 a ) . In these neurons , there - fore , the PKC pathway may dominate over the IP 3 pathway , lead - ing to inhibition of neurite outgrowth in response to MAG and Nogo .

Hasegawaetal . • AxonExtensionbyMAGandNogo J . Neurosci . , July28 , 2004 • 24 ( 30 ) : 6826 – 6832 • 6829 promotion of the axon regeneration induced by MAG or Nogo is that PKC modulates Rho activity , because Rho has been shown to be a key signaling molecule in inhibiting neurite elongation ( Wang et al . , 2002 ; Yamashita et al . , 2002 ) . To address this , we measured RhoA activity in the neurons . Using the RhoA - binding domain of the effector protein Rhotekin ( Ren et al . , 1999 ) , the GTP - bound form of RhoA can be affinity - precipitated . The assay revealed that RhoA was activated 30 min after the addition of MAG – Fc or the Nogo peptide to the P7 rat cerebellar neurons ( Fig . 5 b ) . The PKC inhibitor had no effect on the Rho activity induced by MAG – Fc or the Nogo peptide . Thus , the promotion of neurite outgrowth of the cerebellar neurons by the inhibiting influence of PKC was not mediated by blocking RhoA activation , showing that conventional PKC is not upstream of RhoA . MAG promotes axon growth from DRG neurons of rats up to postnatal day 4 ( Johnson et al . , 1989 ; Mukhopadhyay et al . , 1994 ) , suggesting that responses to these inhibitory cues are de - pendent on cell type and cell context and not simply on age . Because inhibition of PKC leads to the promotion of axon out - growth by MAG in postnatal cerebellar neurons , it is postulated that the IP 3 pathway dominates over the PKC pathway when G i - PLCisactivatedintheseDRGneurons ( Fig . 6 a ) . Toassessthis , the neurite outgrowth from dissociated DRG neurons from P1 rats was measured . As before , MAG – Fc ( 25 (cid:1) M ) promoted neu - rite outgrowth from the DRG neurons ( Fig . 6 b ) .

These findings clearly show that MAG promotes neurite outgrowth , depending on the activity of IP 3 . Finally , to assess whether activation of RhoA is necessary for these effects mediated by MAG – Fc or Nogo , a Rho - kinase inhib - itor , HA1077 , was used at 10 m M . HA1077 , which efficiently blocked the effects of MAG – Fc on the neurite outgrowth from cerebellar neurons , abolished also the effects of MAG – Fc plus the PKC inhibitor ( Fig . 3 c ) . In DRG neurons from P1 rats , the neurite - promoting effect of MAG – Fc was abolished by HA1077 , although HA1077 itself had no effect ( Fig . 6 b ) . In addition , HA1077 abolished the effect of XestC in these neurons . Discussion A new signal was identified with regard to the important effects mediatedbyMAG , Nogo , andmyelin . Theseinhibitorsefficiently promoted neurite outgrowth and elicited growth cone spreading of the neurons when conventional PKC was inhibited , compared with the controls . Our data are consistent with those of Sivasan - karan et al . ( 2004 ) and extend them . Promotion of neurite out - growth of the immature neurons by MAG was converted to inhi - bition if IP 3 was inhibited . Because inhibition of G i or PLC did not result in the modulation of the effects mediated by MAG or Nogo , it is suggested that a balance of the divergent signals is the determinant of these effects . Because PTX did not modulate the effects mediated by MAG on both types of neurons , basal activi - ties of PKC and IP 3 may be important for the regulation of neu - rite outgrowth in the presence of PTX . Future study will focus on the molecular mechanism of how these divergent signals are regulated . Because the elevation of intracellular Ca 2 (cid:1) concentration in - duced by MAG is abolished when treated with the antibody against p75 NTR , p75 NTR may be required for the signal transduc - tion . Therefore , some G - protein - coupled receptors may be func - tionally associated with p75 NTR to transduce the conventional PKC / IP 3 signals . It has long been known that p75 NTR is a receptor for neurotrophins that promote survival and differentiation . Consistent with its function in controlling the survival and neu - rite formation of neurons , p75 NTR is expressed during the devel - opmental stages of the nervous system . In contrast , p75 NTR is re - expressed in various pathological conditions in the adult and may even act as an inhibitor of axon regeneration . Our data pro - vide conceptual evidence that the myelin - derived proteins are bifunctional regulators of axon growth . Diverse effects mediated by p75 NTR are , in part , the consequence of the interaction of p75 NTR with other membrane - associated proteins , such as Trk tyrosine kinases , the Nogo receptor and the ganglioside GT1b , and multiple intracellular signaling molecules ( Dechant and Barde , 2002 ) . The precise molecular mechanism of G i – PLC sig - nals related to p75 NTR should be explored , perhaps by searching for interactors with p75 NTR . Previous studies suggest that Rho plays a central role in inte - grating myelin - derived growth inhibitory signals . Rho is acti - vated by myelin , MAG , and NogoA ( McKerracher and Winton , 2002 ) . We note that Rho signal is a prerequisite for the regulation of neurite elongation , because inhibition of Rho results in disap - pearance of the effects ( Yamashita et al . , 2002 ) . Rho activity was not affected by modulating the activity of conventional PKC . Activation of RhoA by soluble MAG was slow ( 5 – 10 min after exposure ) ( Niederost et al . , 2002 ; Yamashita et al . , 2002 ) , whereas the elevation of the intracellular Ca 2 (cid:1) concentration by MAG – Fc is very rapid . Therefore , it is suggested that there is some cross talk between PKC and the downstream signals of Rho , eliciting bidirectional effects on actin cytoskeleton reorganization . There are some reports exploring the role of Ca 2 (cid:1) with regard to neurite outgrowth . Takei et al . ( 1998 ) demonstrated that IP 3 receptor in the neurons has an important role in neurite exten - sion and that local loss of IP 3 receptor function results in growth arrest and neurite retraction , although the neurons undergo Ca 2 (cid:1) influx across the plasma membrane . Considering these re - sults and our data indicating that XestC inhibits the neurite ex - tension induced by MAG – Fc , IP 3 receptor function , but not Ca 2 (cid:1) itself , mightbeimportantfortheregulationofneuriteelon - gation . The precise molecular events should be explored in the future . It is known that inactivation of Rho or one of its intracellular targets , Rho kinase , actually abolishes the effects of myelin , MAG , and NogoA , thereby providing potential therapeutic agents against CNS injuries ( McKerracher and Winton , 2002 ) . Another promising agent is the silencing peptide that associates with the intracellular domain of p75 NTR ( Yamashita and Tohyama , 2003 ) . p75 NTR , which transduces the signal from every myelin - derived inhibitor found to date , facilitates the release of Rho GDI from RhoA , thus enabling RhoA to be activated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors . Therefore , the peptide inhibits the association ofRhoGDIwithp75 NTR andthesignaltransduction . Inaddition , the peptide antagonist of the Nogo receptor and the IN - 1 anti - body that was generated against a fraction of myelin are shown to be effective in CNS axon regeneration ( McKerracher and Win - ton , 2002 ) . Previous work implicates the cAMP – PKA pathway in the neurite outgrowth regulation ( Cai et al . , 1999 , 2001 ; Neu - mann et al . , 2002 ; Qiu et al . , 2002 ) , showing that previous activa - tion of this pathway counteracts the effects of the inhibitors in vitro as well as in vivo . A consequence of activation of cAMP – PKA was shown to be the synthesis of polyamines , resulting from an upregulation of Arginase I , a key enzyme in their synthesis ( Cai et al . , 2002 ) . Inhibition of polyamine synthesis blocked the cAMP effect on regeneration . Many of the proposed strategies either block inhibitory proteins or block signaling by inhibitory pro - teins . In contrast , our data demonstrate that PKC has the effect of reversing the function of these inhibitors and instead promoting neurite outgrowth or growth cone spreading , providing a potent molecular target against CNS injuries . Myelin - derived inhibitors may act as trophic factors for axotomized neurons under certain conditions . However , it should be noted that none of the neurons used in this study are relevant ones for spinal cord injury . This is a general problem , because much work investigating the in vitro function of the axon growth inhibitors does not use relevant neurons because of the technical difficulty . Because different neurons have different responses to the inhibitors , it is important to focus on the relevant target population to permit identification of relevant pathways in future studies .
