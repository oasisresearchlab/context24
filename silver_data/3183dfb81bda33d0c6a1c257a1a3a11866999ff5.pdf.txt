Fox , and Lauren Ancel Meyers Contact : utpandemics @ austin . utexas . edu Overview In this report , we estimate the spatial distribution of SARS - CoV - 2 infections and vaccine administration across Austin , TX . We find marked geographic differences in these outcomes . In particular , ZIP codes on the western side of the city tend to have higher vaccine coverage and lower estimated cumulative infections than ZIP codes on the eastern side of the city . These differences mirror disparities in social vulnerability , as measured by the CDC’s social vulnerability index ( SVI ) , which tends to be higher in eastern ZIP codes than in western ZIP codes . Estimated SARS - CoV - 2 infection rates and vaccine uptake by ZIP code in Austin Figure 1 maps the spatial distribution of three key estimates across the city of Austin as of early April 2021 : ( 1 ) social vulnerability , ( 2 ) cumulative SARS - CoV - 2 infections , and ( 3 ) proportion of adults aged 16 and older that have received at least one vaccine dose . There is east - west geographic clustering for each indicator , with ZIP codes on the eastern side generally having a higher social vulnerability index ( SVI ) [ 1 ] , higher estimated cumulative infections , and lower estimated rates of vaccine uptake than ZIP codes on the western side of the city . Figure 2 provides a scatter plot showing the correlations between these three variables . Generally , as social vulnerability increases , infection rates increase and vaccination rates decrease . As of the first week of April 2021 , a one percent increase in the estimated cumulative infections in a ZIP code is associated with 0 . 52 percentage point decrease in vaccination coverage in that ZIP code ( p < 0 . 001 ; R - sq = 0 . 36 ) . Similarly , a 0 . 01 increase in the SVI a ZIP code is associated with a 0 . 43 percentage point decrease in vaccination coverage in that ZIP code ( p < 0 . 001 ; R - sq = 0 . 50 ) . We also considered the possibility that the estimated disparities in vaccine coverage are simply caused by differences in the proportion of the population over 65 in each ZIP code , rather than general differences in uptake . For this , we conducted a linear regression analysis relating vaccine coverage by ZIP code to three variables : the proportion of the population over 65 , the social vulnerability index , and the estimated cumulative infection rate . Even after adjusting for demographics ( over 65 ) and the cumulative infection rate , we found that social vulnerability is significantly associated with lower vaccine coverage . An increase in SVI of 0 . 01 corresponds to a decrease in vaccine coverage of 0 . 40 percentage points ( p = 0 . 007 ) , compared to 0 . 43 percentage points when not accounting for demographics . Figure 1 . Estimated social vulnerability ( left ) , cumulative SARS - CoV - 2 infections ( middle ) , and SARS - CoV - 2 vaccine coverage ( right ) for 43 ZIP codes in Austin , Texas . The CDC’s social vulnerability index ( SVI ) is a measure of poverty , lack of access to transportation , crowded housing and other factors that increase the likelihood of human suffering and economic loss [ 1 ] . Cumulative infections is the percentage of the population in each ZIP which has been previously infected by SARS - CoV - 2 , and is estimated from COVID - 19 hospital admissions data through March 29 , 2021 [ 2 ] . Vaccine coverage is defined as the percentage of the adult population age 16 and older which has received at least one dose of a COVID - 19 vaccine as of April 5 , 2021 [ 3 ] . Black lines represent highways I - 35 and US - 183 . Colors are scaled to reflect values relative to the city average , with white corresponding to the average value across all 43 ZIP codes . There is a marked geographic pattern in all three measures , with eastern ZIP codes tending to have higher social vulnerability , higher infection rates , and lower vaccination coverage . UT COVID - 19 Consortium 2 April 12 , 2021 Figure 2 . Relationship between social vulnerability , cumulative SARS - CoV - 2 infections , and vaccine uptake in the 43 ZIP codes of Austin , Texas . Each point represents a ZIP code . The color of each point indicates the social vulnerability index ( SVI ; higher is more vulnerable ) of the ZIP code , which is a measure of poverty , lack of access to transportation , crowded housing and other factors that increase the likelihood of human suffering and economic loss [ 1 ] . Cumulative infections is the percentage of the population in each ZIP which has been previously infected by SARS - CoV - 2 , and is estimated from COVID - 19 hospital admissions data through March 29 , 2021 [ 2 ] . Vaccine coverage is defined as the percentage of the adult population over age 17 which has received at least one dose of a COVID - 19 vaccine as of April 5 , 2021 [ 3 ] . A one percentage point increase in attack rate is associated with a drop in vaccine coverage of 0 . 52 percentage points ( p < 0 . 001 ; R - sq = 0 . 36 ) . Similarly , a 0 . 01 increase in SVI is associated with a decrease in vaccine coverage of 0 . 43 percentage points ( p < 0 . 001 ; R - sq = 0 . 50 ) . UT COVID - 19 Consortium 3 April 12 , 2021 Limitations Vaccination coverage estimates Vaccination data from Texas DSHS [ 3 ] are subject to reporting delays and thus may not be up to date in all ZIP codes . Furthermore , the ZIP code of the vaccine recipient is reported by the vaccine provider to ImmTrac2 and may be inaccurate if the recipient’s ZIP code : ● is not provided accurately or at all by the vaccine recipient ● no longer reflects the recipient’s residence ● is not entered accurately or at all into ImmTrac2 by the provider Of the 8 . 2 million vaccine recipients in the data set , approximately 0 . 9 % have an invalid or unknown ZIP code and approximately 0 . 6 % are outside of Texas . Therefore , our estimates may not fully or accurately represent vaccination coverage throughout the city . Cumulative infection estimates We note several assumptions of our analysis . First , the population composition of each ZIP code is based on 2015 - 2019 ACS data , which does not account for annual fluctuations in ZIP codes . Fluctuations may occur due to large numbers of university student residents migrating seasonally ( 78705 for UT Austin ) or those who may have relocated permanently during 2020 , both influx of new residents and outflux of those displaced . Estimates for ZIP codes have additional uncertainty and should be considered with caution . Second , our estimates for age groups and ZIP codes with small numbers of hospitalizations have a high level of uncertainty . Finally , the case and hospitalization data does not include individuals who were tested or required hospitalization for COVID - 19 while traveling outside of Austin or whose addresses were not correctly recorded . For example , people experiencing homelessness or undocumented residents may be less likely to provide addresses . Such omissions would lead to underestimation of the cumulative infections and overestimation of the reporting rates . Data and Methods The CDC social vulnerability index ( SVI ) was calculated for Texas at the census tract level using the 2014 - 2018 American Community Survey ( ACS ) [ 1 ] . SVI is a composite of a number of factors which may make a community vulnerable to natural or UT COVID - 19 Consortium 4 April 12 , 2021 human - made disasters , and includes measures of poverty and crowded housing . SVI values are percentile ranks of census tracts within Texas . For example , a census tract with an SVI of 0 . 6 is more vulnerable than 60 % of the census tracts in Texas . SVI was converted to ZIP code level using the percent of residential addresses in each census tract from the 3rd quarter 2020 crosswalk provided by the U . S . Department of Housing and Urban Development ( HUD ) [ 4 ] . For each ZIP code , total infections were estimated from reported age - stratified COVID - 19 hospitalizations in the Austin area through March 29 , 2021 and the estimated infection hospitalization ratio ( IHR ) for each age group and ZIP code . To transform these estimates into percents , we divided each by the population size of the ZIP code , according to the 2015 - 2019 ACS [ 5 ] . Children under one year of age were excluded from the analysis . Children ages 1 - 19 were grouped together , adults 20 or over were grouped into 10 year bins up to age 70 . IHRs for each age group were based on estimates from France [ 6 ] and then transformed for each ZIP code based on the ratio between the high risk proportion in the ZIP code versus France . Individuals with conditions listed as high risk for severe illness by the CDC were separated into high risk subgroups [ 7 ] . For Austin , we estimated the high risk proportion of each ZIP code based on the CDC PLACES dataset [ 8 ] and calculated pregnancy rates by following the methodology in the CDC reproductive health report [ 9 ] . For France , we used a similar methodology to estimate high risk proportions based on comorbidity data for France [ 10 – 13 ] . The high risk group was assumed to be six times more likely to be hospitalized than the low risk group [ 14 ] . A prior report on the spatial burden of COVID - 19 infections in the Austin - Round Rock Metropolitan area [ 2 ] provides a detailed description of the methods for estimating cumulative infections . However , in this analysis , we grouped age groups across ZIP codes with zero reported hospitalizations to avoid overestimation . Vaccine administration data are provided daily by the Texas Department of State Health Services , aggregated by residential ZIP code of the vaccine recipient [ 3 ] . As of April 2021 , the FDA has authorized SARS - CoV - 2 vaccines to be used in person at least 18 years old ( Moderna ; Janssen ) or 16 years old ( Pfizer ) . Therefore , we combine vaccine administration data and ZIP code population estimates from the 2015 - 2019 ACS to estimate adult vaccine coverage , that is , the percentage of the adult population aged 16 and older that has received at least one dose of a SARS - CoV - 2 vaccine . Our estimates for vaccine coverage reflect data collected through the end of April 5 , 2021 . UT COVID - 19 Consortium 5 April 12 , 2021 References 1 .
