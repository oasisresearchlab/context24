Abstract The process of clathrin - coated vesicle ( CCV ) formation / disassembly has been studied intensively , and numerous proteins have been identiﬁed which aid this process . We have learnt a great deal about individual components of the CCV machinery , and now the ultimate aim is to elucidate the mechanisms regulating clathrin - mediated trafﬁcking . One of the fundamental processes governing the complicated network of interactions is phosphorylation . It has been known for some time that several proteins associated with clathrin - coated vesicles are substrates for protein kinases . These proteins include clathrin , three of the four adaptor complex subunits , dynamin 1 , synaptojanin 1 and the amphiphysins . However , the identities of the kinases involved in this process remained largely unknown until recently . This short review discusses advances in our knowledge of how CCV formation / disassembly is regulated by the phosphorylation / dephosphorylation cycle and the role played by speciﬁc protein kinases in that process . Introduction to clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) CME is a major vesicular transport mechanism in eukaryotic cells . It is designed to allow the internalization of nutrients , hormones and other molecules from the plasma membrane into intracellular compartments . The carrier vesicles of this pathway are designated clathrin - coated vesicles ( CCVs ) , as they are encapsulated into the cage formed by the interaction of clathrin molecules . The clathrin molecule is called a triskelion , and consists of three heavy chains each of which is bound to one of two light chains ( LCa and LCb ) . A central feature of clathrin triskelia is their ability to assemble spontaneously into polymers that play a pivotal structural role in CCVs ( reviewed in [ 1 , 2 ] ) . Receptors and their ligands are recruited into CCVs forming at the plasma membrane . This process is facilitated by specific adaptors that have the bivalent capacity to interact with both cytosolic domains ( ‘tails’ ) of receptors and clathrin . The main adaptor molecule of CME is the heterotetrameric assembly protein designated adaptor protein - 2 ( AP - 2 ) . AP - 2 consistsoftwoheavy ( α and β 2 ) subunits ( whichinteractwith clathrin ) , a medium µ 2 subunit ( which binds to some sorting signals of internalized receptors ) and a small σ subunit . AP - 2 recognizes a variety of receptors that contain a tyrosine - based YXX (cid:4) motif ( where (cid:4) denotes a bulky hydrophobic residue ; e . g . transferrin receptor ) , a dileucine - based motif ( e . g . CD3 - γ ) or an NPXY motif ( e . g . low - density lipoprotein receptor ) in their cytosolic tails ( reviewed in [ 1 , 2 ] ) . In addition , other proteins such as monomeric β - arrestins can also act as adaptors . Arrestins are linker proteins for the sequestration of ligand - activated G - protein - coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) Key words : adaptor protein - 2 ( AP - 2 ) , clathrin - coated vesicle , clathrin - mediated endocytosis , kinase , phosphorylation .

Generally , endocytic CCVs should be viewed as a heterogeneous pool of vesicles that vary significantly in composition , but use a universal protein coat . In addition to the main structural components , CCVs contain many accessory proteins that play various roles at different stages of vesicle formation and disassembly . Thus , for example , AP - 180 / CALM ( adaptor protein - 180 / clathrin assembly lymphoid myeloid leukaemia protein ) , amphiphysin and synaptotagmin are thought to regulate clathrin and adaptor assembly [ 4 – 6 ] , epsin has recently been implicated in the process of membrane invagination [ 7 ] , dynamin , amphiphysin and endophilin I participate in the fission reaction [ 8 – 11 ] , while Hsc70 , auxilin and synaptojanin play a role in CCV uncoating [ 12 , 13 ] . All of these , and the other proteins implicated in CME , are interconnected by a complicated network of interactions that ensure that CCV assembly and disassembly are well - orchestrated processes . Regulatory role of kinases Phosphorylation is one of the fundamental mechanisms gov - erning interactions in cells . The CCV cycle does not seem to beanexception , sincemanyofthecoreandaccessoryproteins of the CCV machinery are phosphorylated reversibly in vivo [ 14 – 17 ] . One can classify phosphorylation events in CCVs into two functionally opposite classes : ( i ) those that are in - hibitoryforCCVformation ( ‘negativephosphorylation’ ) and ( ii ) those that facilitate the assembly of CCVs ( ‘positive phos - phorylation’ ) . Probably the best characterized example to date of negative regulation by phosphorylation is phos - phorylation in the hinge region of the α and β 2 subunitsof the AP - 2 complex . Phosphorylated AP - 2 has a reduced ability to interact with clathrin and requires dephosphorylation for efficient interaction [ 14 , 19 ] . Clathrin LCs ( primarily LCb ) are also subject to phosphorylation both in vitro and in vivo C (cid:1) 2003 Biochemical Society 858 Biochemical Society Transactions ( 2003 ) Volume 31 , part 4 Table 1 Proteins involved in CME and kinases regulating their function MAPK , mitogen - activated protein kinase ; PKC , protein kinase C ; PKA , protein kinase A ; CaMKII , Ca 2 + / calmodulin - dependent protein kinase II .

The very limited data on this suggest that the phosphoryla - tion of LCs could be inhibitory for coat assembly [ 15 , 19 ] . Phosphorylation also appears to be important in modulating the function of several other proteins implicated in endocyto - sis ; these include dynamin 1 , amphiphysins 1 and 2 , AP - 180 , synaptojanin , epsin and Eps15 ( collectively called dephos - phins ) . These proteins are found in the phosphorylated state in resting nerve terminals , and are dephosphorylated when stimulation invokes a burst of CCV formation [ 17 ] . It was shown that phosphorylation of dynamin 1 and synaptojanin 1 inhibits their binding to amphiphysin , while phosphorylated amphiphysin has an impaired affinity for AP - 2 and clathrin [ 20 ] . In contrast with the bulk of CCV - associated proteins ( where phosphorylation appears to correlate with disasso - ciation of the coat from the vesicle ) , phosphorylation of the µ 2 subunit is an example of positive regulation in the CCV cycle . When phosphorylated on its medium subunit , AP - 2 has a 25 - fold higher affinity for tyrosine - containing sorting motifs in the cytosolic tails of receptors and an increased affinity for lipid membranes [ 21 , 22 ] . Recent structural data on AP - 2 suggest a possible molecular explanation for these observations . Apparently , the binding site in µ 2 for the tyrosine - containing motif is buried in the AP - 2 complex ; thus a conformational change is required for its exposure . This could be triggered by phosphorylation of µ 2 [ 23 ] . Tyrosine phosphorylation of the clathrin heavy chain in its hub domain by Src - family kinases is another example of positive phosphorylation . It was shown that ligand binding to the epidermal growth factor receptor leads , via activation of protein kinase activity , to clathrin phosphorylation . This phosphorylation enhances clathrin recruitment to the plasma membrane [ 24 ] . EnhancedinteractionwithCCVcomponents is also observed during internalization of ligand - activated GPCRs . In this case , ligand binding leads to phosphorylation of the GPCR , which is then recognized by β - arrestins [ 3 ] . Identiﬁcation of CCV - associated kinases It has been known for many years that kinase activities could be found in purified preparations of CCVs . Several groups attempted to identify the kinases responsible for the phosphorylation events mentioned above ; this information is presented in Table 1 . Thus it was shown that CK2 ( formerly known as casein kinase 2 ) plays an essential role in endocytosis , as inhibition of CK2 leads to a significant decrease in transferrin uptake [ 25 ] . CK2 is highly enriched in CCV preparations and phosphorylates LCb in vitro [ 18 ] . As mentioned above , LCb is also found to be phosphorylated in vivo , but the functional role of this phosphorylation event in endocytosis is not entirely clear at present . It was also found that CK2 phosphorylates the α and β 2 subunits of the AP - 2 adaptor complex in vitro [ 26 ] . It is possible that CK2 plays the same role in vivo . In vitro phosphorylation of AP - 2 by CK2 prevents AP - 2 from binding to clathrin cages , thus mimicking the effect observed in vivo [ 14 ] . There is also evidence that a kinase other than CK2 may phosphorylateAP - 2 invivo . Thiscomesfromtheobservation that β 2 - adaptin was phosphorylated even in the presence of a CK2 inhibitor [ 27 ] . It is therefore possible that more than one kinase is responsible for phosphorylating β 2 - adaptin . Additional studies are required to ascertain the identity of the kinase ( s ) phosphorylating the α and β 2 subunits of AP - 2 in vivo . CK2 may phosphorylate a number of other targets im - plicated in endocytosis ; these include AP - 180 , dynamin and synaptotagmin [ 4 , 16 , 28 ] . These phosphorylation events can C (cid:1) 2003 Biochemical Society Molecular Mechanisms of Exocytosis and Endocytosis 859 probably be classified as ‘negative’ ( ones that inhibit CCV formation ) , so the presence of an active kinase on a CCV would be harmful to the integrity of that CCV . Therefore it is significant that we have found CK2 to be inactive on intact CCVs , but active after uncoating of CCVs [ 26 ] . The inactivity of CK2 when associated with CCVs is due to inhibition by an unknown component of lipid membranes . Such inhibition might be a regulatory mechanism for preventing unwanted phosphorylation of CCV components [ 26 ] . The molecular mechanisms regulating the activity of CK2 remain to be elucidated . Another kinase activity found in purified CCVs is directed towards the medium ( µ 2 ) subunit of the AP - 2 adaptor complex . The identity of the kinase that phosphorylates µ 2 remained obscure for a long time . Recently , two candidate kinases have been described in the literature [ 21 , 26 , 29 – 32 ] . One of them , termed GAK ( for cyclin G - associated protein kinase ) , was shown to phosphorylate both µ 1 ( the medium - chain subunit of the AP - 1 adaptor complex that functions in clathrin - coated vesicular transport between the trans - Golgi network and endosomes ) and µ 2 recombinant proteins in vitro [ 29 ] . It was also demonstrated that GAK co - purifies with CCVs , and that immunoprecipitated GAK can phosphorylate the endogenous µ 2 subunit in vitro [ 26 ] . GAK is a complex protein ; in addition to an N - terminal kinase domain , it contains a central tensin homology domain and a C - terminal J domain . This C - terminal domain shows similarity to auxilin , a neuronal protein that facilitates Hsc70 in the uncoating of CCVs . Hence an alternative ( and possibly more appropriate ) name for GAK is auxilin 2 [ 30 ] . GAK was shown to bind directly to both clathrin and the appendage domain of α - adaptin [ 29 ] . GAK / auxilin 2 is localized mostly to the trans - Golgi network ( in HeLa cells at least ) . However , its overexpression completely prevents transferrin uptake [ 29 , 30 ] , implying a role for GAK / auxilin 2 in endocytosis . Given the multifunctional nature of GAK / auxilin 2 , it is presently difficult to conclude whether the effect of GAK / auxilin 2 overexpression on endocytosis is due to its role in clathrin uncoating or µ 2 phosphorylation . Another kinase , called AAK1 ( for adaptor - associated kinase 1 ) , is also capable of phosphorylating the µ 2 subunit of AP - 2 . AAK1 was identified using a phage display library screening strategy [ 31 ] . Just like GAK / auxilin 2 , AAK1 is enriched in purified CCV preparations and phosphorylates the µ 2 subunit of AP - 2 in vitro [ 31 ] . Importantly , the phosphorylation site for AAK1 in µ 2 ( Thr - 156 ) is identical to the one used by the endogenous kinase [ 21 ] . AAK1 is composed of three domains : an N - terminal serine / threonine kinase domain that is 40 % identical to the kinase domain of GAK / auxilin 2 , a QPA - rich domain and a C - terminal α - adaptin - interacting domain that contains both adaptin - and clathrin - interacting motifs . In cultured cells AAK1 co - localizes with AP - 2 in sites that show active endocytosis , and overexpression of AAK1 in HeLa cells selectively inhibits transferrin uptake [ 31 ] . An intriguing question concerns the relationship between GAK / auxilin 2 and AAK1 kinase activities in endocytosis . It is possible that the kinases act simultaneously , or that their functions might be temporally and / or spatially separated . Co - localization and direct interaction of GAK / auxilin 2 with the AP - 1 adaptor complex [ 29 ] also hint at a possible role for GAK / auxilin 2 in transport from the trans - Golgi network . Other kinases in CCVs Various kinases have been suggested to be present in CCVs , and several of the peripheral membrane proteins associated with CCVs have been shown to be substrates for a range of different kinases ( e . g . see Table 1 ) . However , it is beyond the scope of this short review to go beyond the major kinases that appear to be involved , i . e . CK2 , GAK / auxilin 2 and AAK - 1 . A model for the roles of CK2 , GAK / auxilin 2 and AAK - 1 in CME Figure 1 illustrates the possible role ( s ) of GAK / auxilin 2 and AAK - 1 in the CCV assembly / disassembly cycle . Although very little is known about the precise timing of the action of the different kinases , it is possible to speculate that the µ 2 subunit of AP - 2 is phosphorylated immediately prior to the adaptor complex interacting with a tyrosine - based motif in a receptor protein , thus facilitating this interaction . µ 2 is predicted to remain phosphorylated during the life of the CCV . Dissociation of clathrin then triggers release of GAK / auxilin 2 and / or AAK - 1 from the CCV . This leads to dephosphorylation of µ 2 and the subsequent release of AP - 2 from the CCV membrane . Newly formed CCVs would also incorporate CK2 in an inactive , membrane - bound form that prevents premature phosphorylation of several components of the CCV machinery and subsequent disassembly . Un - coating of clathrin would immediately release CK2 from the inhibition imposed by the CCV membrane and allow CK2 to phosphorylate its diverse CCV peripheral membrane protein substrates . This phosphorylation would render the relevant CCV peripheral membrane proteins incompetent for assembly , and thus preclude re - assembly of the clathrin coat components on the membrane of the vesicle from which the coat has just been removed . Thus phosphorylation of LCb might prevent its re - association , and phosphorylation of the heavychainsofAP - 2wouldleadtotheirreleasefromvesicles . Subsequent dephosphorylation of these coat components in the cytosol would make them available for incorporation into newly forming CCVs at the cell surface . What is next ? As is evident from Table 1 , we currently have only a few pieces of the puzzle available . Many collaborative efforts are required in order to obtain more detailed insight into how the process of endocytosis is regulated at the molecular level . The identity of many kinases and phosphatases , their location and the timing of their action remain to be determined .
