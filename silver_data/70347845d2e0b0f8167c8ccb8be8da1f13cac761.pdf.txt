Enteric and diarrheal diseases are global concerns . They are responsible for more than half of the bur - den of foodborne illnesses 1 , kill ~ 500 , 000 children under the age of 5 years each year and were responsible for an estimated 1 . 7 billion episodes of childhood diarrhea in 2010 2 . Consequently , the societal impact of salmonellosis and the global burden are large , estimated at US $ 3 . 3 billion a year for the United States alone 3 . Bacterial motil - ity is a key determinant of pathogenicity and biofilm formation . More than 70 % of bacterial species carry one or more flagella 4 . Flagellar motility relies on the hook , which transmits torque across a dynamic polypeptide network . Its molecular mechanism has broad implications for biophysics , antimicrobial strategies , engineering and nanotechnology . The bacterial flagellum is a large protein complex composed of a filament propeller , a rotary motor anchored in the cell mem - brane and a hook - shaped flexible joint ( ‘the hook’ ) connecting the two structures . A central channel runs through the entire length of the flagellum , allowing protein components of the filament and the hook to reach the tip of a growing structure 5 . The filament is com - posed of a single protein ( FliC ) , forming a supercoiled tubular helix . In earlier studies , the term ‘flagellum’ was often used to indicate the helical filament . A helix can be defined by a pair of helical parameters : its pitch P ( the distance along the helical axis to reach the exact same subunit configuration ) and its diameter D . In wild - type Salmonella filament ( often called ‘normal’ ) , P and D are 2 . 55 and 0 . 60 µ m , respectively , and the helix is left - handed . Under different physiological conditions , the normal filament changes into different helical forms : ‘coiled’ ( P and D of 0 and 1 . 00 µ m , left - handed ) , ‘semi - coiled’ ( 1 . 29 and 0 . 50 µ m , right - handed ) , ‘curly I’ ( 1 . 20 and 0 . 20 µ m , right - handed ) and ‘curly II’ ( 1 . 00 and 0 . 15 µ m , right - handed ) 6 – 8 . These helical polymorphs are discrete ( or discontinuous ) , suggesting that the component subunits may assume several distinguishable conformations . In addition to these polymorphs , there are two types of straight filament produced in two strains of Salmonella . They appear similar microscopically and their FliC proteins differ only by a few point mutations , but on close examination in an electron microscope , their protofilaments are tilted against the filament axis , 3 . 4 ± 1 . 0° to the left ( called L type ) or 7 . 8 ± 0 . 8° to the right ( R type ) . By mixing these two types of flagellin in various ratios , the polymorphs men - tioned above appeared in reconstituted filaments . These data led to the conclusion that polymorphs were composed of the two subunit conformations in various ratios 9 . Asakura and others illustrated this concept by employing the allosteric model of cooperativity of Monod – Wyman – Changeux ( MWC ) 10 – 12 . This ‘two - state model’ ( bistable switching ) was further developed and substantiated by Calladine , and the helical parameters were replaced with the terms ‘twist’ and ‘bend’ 13 . The flagellar hook is also a supercoiled tubular helix , composed of a single protein ( FlgE ) and , like the filament , shows several polymorphs 14 . By analogy with the flagellar filament , it has been assumed that the underlying molecular mechanism for hook poly - morphism was based on a two - state model . Because the number of polymorphs observed in polyhooks ( abnormally long hooks from a mutant strain ) is larger than in filaments , the number of protofila - ments in the hook was proposed to be 16 ( ref . 14 ) . Here , we show the complete structure of the bacterial hook in its supercoiled ‘curved’ state , determined at 2 . 9 Å resolution by single - particle cryo - EM using a variation of the iterative helical recon - struction method 15 , without imposing helical symmetry . We found that subunits in the curved hook are grouped into 11 distinctive conformations , each shared along protofilaments running in the 11 - start direction of the hook . The coiled macroscopic shape of the hook is caused by small cooperative conformational changes in its subunits , whose domains behave as rigid bodies connected by two hinge regions . These findings demonstrate how chemically identical subunits can dynamically change conformations through physical interactions while bending , and how they transmit torque through a curved tubular structure . Our data explain a molecular mechanism for supercoiling of tubular structures and provide a rational basis for understanding allosteric transitions between polymorphic states of superhelical assemblies . Torque transmission mechanism of the curved bacterial flagellar hook revealed by cryo - EM Satoshi Shibata 1 , 3 , Hideyuki Matsunami 1 , 3 , Shin - Ichi Aizawa 2 * and Matthias Wolf 1 * Bacterial locomotion by rotating flagella is achieved through the hook , which transmits torque from the motor to the filament . The hook is a tubular structure composed of a single type of protein , yet it adopts a curved shape . To perform its function , it must be simultaneously flexible and torsionally rigid . The molecular mechanism by which chemically identical subunits form such a dynamic structure is unknown . Here , we show the complete structure of the hook from Salmonella enterica in its super - coiled ‘curved’ state , at 2 . 9 Å resolution . Subunits in the curved hook are grouped into 11 distinctive conformations , each shared along 11 protofilaments . The domains of the elongated hook subunit behave as rigid bodies connected by two hinge regions . The reconstituted model demonstrates how identical subunits can dynamically change conformation by physical interactions while bending . These multiple subunit states contradict the two - state model , which is a key feature of flagellar polymorphism .

We purified polyhooks from a fliK mutant of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium , which produces uncontrolled long hooks due to lack of a length - measuring mechanism 16 . The poly - hooks were then fragmented with ultrasonic pulses . The sample was suspended in 50 mM glycine buffer ( pH 3 . 5 ) at room temperature . Under these conditions , polyhooks form ring - like structures on flat support grids when negatively stained ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) 14 and adopt a coiled form in amorphous ice ( Fig . 1a ) . Cryo - EM images clearly visualize the distinctive subunits in the curved hook , which are maximally separated at the outermost line ( OML ) and most closely packed at the innermost line ( IML ) . The cross - sectional views observed in electron micrographs ( Fig . 1a , arrows ) and in two - dimensional ( 2D ) class averages ( Fig . 1b , bottom right corner ) suggest that these are projections of a 3D superhelix of the polyhook . 3D reconstruction demonstrated that this was the case ( Fig . 1c ) . We reconstructed the curved hook structure by single particle analysis from 234 , 536 image segments , without imposing helical symmetry ( Table 1 ) . The achieved resolution of 2 . 9 Å allowed us to build atomic models of a complete assembly of 66 individual subunits ( Fig . 1c and Supplementary Figs . 2 and 3a ) . The hook subunit is composed of three domains including a Dc domain . The hook subunit protein , FlgE , is an elongated molecule similar to flagellin , and it consists of three domains ( D0 , D1 and D2 ) ( Fig . 2a ) . Its polypeptide chain threads its way from D0 at the central channel through D1 to the peripheral D2 and back to the channel . An additional Dc domain that lies between D0 and D1 was previously thought to be disordered based on homology mod - eling 17 , or else its resolution was too low to trace by cryo - EM 18 . Thus , it has been regarded as a separate domain . The Dc domain is not essential for hook assembly , because deletion ( 40D – 59D ) of the Dc peptide does not prevent hook assembly 18 . However , Dc is important for strengthening the hook structure , because the addi - tion of a foreign peptide gives rise to a straight hook and increases its stiffness , matching the rod 18 . Our analysis indicates that Dc is a structurally well - defined anti - parallel β - hairpin composed of 34 residues ( 30G – 63G ) ( Fig . 2a ) and behaves as part of the D0 domain in the hook . a b c IML OML + 6 – 11 – 5 Fig . 1 | cryo - EM of polyhooks from Salmonella enterica . a , Digital EM image of polyhooks in amorphous ice , showing their supercoiled form .

We chose a set of 11 subunits from a complete helical turn and superimposed them . When the structures were aligned on their D0 domains , the D1 and D2 domains displayed a pivoting and swaying motion ( Fig . 2a , b and Supplementary Video 1 ) , in which D2 moves as much as 27 Å . To quantify this motion , we calculated the cen - troids ( geometric centers of the atomic coordinates ) of each domain , which behaved as rigid bodies , and measured the distances between the domain centers ( d0 – 1 and d1 – 2 ) ( Fig . 2a – c ) . The two distances changed cyclically in a synchronous manner . Accordingly , the angle between the centroids of D0 – D1 – D2 oscillated synchronously with opposite phase ( Fig . 2c ) . We identified two sets of hinge regions by aligning the 11 unique subunits on their D1 domains . Hinge regions are defined by a root mean square deviation ( r . m . s . d . ) of < 1 . 5 Å of their α - carbon atoms . They consist of adjacent amino acid residue pairs on the outward - and inward - running polypeptide chains : hinge regions h1 ( residues 62TDG and 362SNV ) and h2 ( 139PNT and 309QVLG ) ( Fig . 2d ) . As each hinge region is formed by two polypeptide backbones , its bending direction is restricted , explain - ing the elliptical trajectory of the exterior D2 domains ( Fig . 2b ) . Furthermore , multiple sequence alignment of FlgE from a vari - ety of 20 bacterial species revealed that this hinge motif is wide - spread in the bacterial kingdom , suggesting a common design ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . Eleven distinct subunit conformations are arranged on 11 pro - tofilaments . We found 11 groups of quite similar conformations ( r . m . s . d . < 1 . 5 Å ) by systematic comparison of all subunits with geometries refined against the cryo - EM electron potential map ( Supplementary Table 1 ) ; that is , six nearly identical subunits were aligned in the 11 - start direction of the helical lattice along the OML and IML ( Supplementary Figs . 3 and 5 ) . We then picked a group of subunits at positions 0 , 11 , 22 , 33 , 44 and 55 along the helical lat - tice and confirmed that the superimposed structures of the subunits within each of these groups were almost identical ( Fig . 3a ) —that is , subunits from each group were part of a protofilament . The subunits on the other protofilaments between the OML and IML exhibited gradual changes between the two extreme conformations ( Fig . 2c ) . In other words , the hook is a short , supercoiled helix composed of quasi - equivalent subunits arranged on 11 protofilaments . Subunit domains carry out unique biomechanical functions . Each domain forms a layer at different radii of the hook . The D0 domain assembles into a tube and constitutes the central channel , the D1 domain composes the middle body and the D2 domain is mostly exposed on the surface 19 , 20 ( Fig . 3b ) . Views of hook lay - ers in the OML and IML directions revealed that each domain forms distinctive lattice structures in its corresponding layer : D0 domains interact along the 11 - start direction . Their long α - helices , which form the central channel , are linked by hydrophobic inter - actions ( Fig . 3b bottom and Supplementary Fig . 5 ) . Together with Dc domains , they are responsible for longitudinal connectivity , but permit flexible bending . D1 domains interact with many partners along the 5 - start ( Fig . 3b middle ) , 11 - start and 6 - start directions . These interactions between the tightly packed spoke - like subunits convey torsional rigidity and must be responsible for transmitting most of the torque generated by the bacterial motor . In contrast to OML , the D1 loop ( residues 117 – 132 , Fig . 3a , c ) closely approaches the center - facing surface of D2 from the next subunit on the same protofilament at the IML h1 h2 a b d c 1 2 3 4 5 I n t e r - do m a i n ang l e ( deg ) I n t e r - do m a i n d i s t an c e ( Å ) 6 50 170 160 150 d1 – 2 d0 – 1 38 40 42 44 46 48 180 140 No . of turns d1 – 2 A ng l e d0 – 1 D2 D1 D0 Dc D0 D1 1 3 5 17 7 9 11 4 2 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 13 15 19 21 × Angle Fig . 2 | Domain motions of subunits around helical turns . a , The three major domains ( centroids of D0 ( including Dc ) , D1 and D2 are depicted as colored spheres ) behave as rigid bodies linked by flexible hinges .

( See Source data . ) d , The alignment of 11 subunits on the D1 domain reveals two hinge regions , h1 ( residues 62TQD and 362SNV ) and h2 ( 139PNT and 309QVLG ) . The hinges are composed of pairs of flexible amino acid residues on two adjacent polypeptide chains , providing directionally constrained bending .

However , we could only identify a single direct polar con - tact ( N132 - T186 ) , because most of the side chains were more than 3 . 6 Å apart . D1 loop deletion reduced motility , but is non - essential for hook function 21 . Our structure suggests that the sliding inter - action of the D1 loop against D2 may couple this interface only indirectly , by weak hydrogen bonding interactions via intermediate water molecules . The D2 domains interface tightly along the 6 - start direction ( Fig . 3b , top ) , giving rise to the deep grooves of the hook surface ( Fig . 1b , c ) . Although the D2 domains are tightly linked by hydro - gen bonding and electrostatic interactions , they do not interact in the axial 11 - start direction , allowing a large bending motion ( OML versus IML in Fig . 3b top and Supplementary Fig . 5 ) . Mutant hooks lacking the D2 domain are straight 22 . Hence , the D2 domain is essential for the curvature of the hook . We propose that the tightly bonded peripheral D2 domains synchronize subunit inter - domain angles on the same protofilament while gradually adjusting them between protofilaments during rotation , as the structure flexibly bends via its central D0 domains . In summary , each layer contributes an essential set of unique inter - domain interactions that confer different physical properties , such as bending and twisting . Discussion Previous structures based on straight hooks 19 , 20 , 23 did not reveal a molecular mechanism for supercoiling of these tubular structures . The bacterial flagellar hook acts as a universal joint to transmit torque to filaments , which work together in a bundle pointed in a certain direction 24 . Both the filament and the hook are helical tubes . The two - state model ( bistable switching ) proposed by Calladine 13 , 25 has been employed to explain polymorphism of the filament . Based on our structure of the curved hook , it is clear that the two - state model is not applicable to the hook , because we observed at least 11 distinct subunit conformations , suggesting that there is no pre - determined conformation . Instead , each subunit undergoes con - tinuous transitions between several conformations by coordinated domain motions in each subunit . The subunit conformation of the straight hook 26 ( PDB 3A69 ) is quite close to one or two of the states observed in our reconstruction , but not precisely the same ( Fig . 2c , horizontal lines ) . This difference might be explained by the limited resolution of the straight hook structure . Classic models of allosteric interactions , most prominently the symmetry model ( MWC ) 11 , 12 , which stands in opposition to the sequential model ( Koshland – Nemethy – Filmer , KNF ) 27 , describe cooperativity among subunits . Their assumptions are that a ligand ( agonist or antagonist ) affects the conformation of an enzyme by an allosteric effect , causing a change in affinity for the substrate . In the hook , the protomers ( subunits in a given conformation arranged on protofilaments ) act simultaneously as ligands and substrates , influencing the conformations of adjacent protofilaments in a cyclic manner . In this respect , the present mechanism is more consistent with the sequential model . However , there is no explicit change in domain conformations , which act as rigid bodies connected by flex - ible hinges . We define allosteric change as the change in shape of the entire subunit . Thus , the hook is a mechanically synchronized pas - sive element , which performs the niche task of a flexible joint , and its mechanism of cooperativity represents a special case that does not fit the classical models of allosteric cooperativity . Although we have reconstructed a static view of the curved hook , it contains all of the necessary subunit conformations to visu - alize its dynamic behavior during actual rotation . We have created a video of the rotating hook using our 66 - subunit model , by cyclically replacing the positions of the 11 protofilaments ( Supplementary Video 2 ) and morphing between them .

Their subunit conformations are nearly identical ( Supplementary Table 1 ) , indicating that the subunits along the 11 - start direction behave as protofilaments ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . b , Each domain forms a unique helical lattice with a different cylinder radius . Arrangement of the domains at the OML , with close - ups of molecular interactions ( inter - atomic distances < 3 . 6 Å ) , are shown on the left , and at the IML on the right . The following inter - domain relationships do not change significantly between the OML and IML : the D2 domains are tightly linked by hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions in the 6 - start direction ( top ) between protofilaments , but do not interact in the 11 - start direction , allowing flexible bending . The most prominent inter - protofilament interaction between the central D1 domains is a polar contact in the 5 - start direction ( N351 – D287 , middle ) . Contacts between the D0 domains within the same protofilament are dominated by hydrophobic interactions linking the beginning and end of their C - terminal α - helices ( bottom ) . c , A significant change in the relative positions between D1 and D2 is observed when comparing the OML and IML . The D1 loop marked in a closely approaches D2 at the IML on the next subunit from the same protofilament ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . However , the large distance > 3 . 6 Å suggests that this variable interaction involves a solvent - mediated hydrogen bonding network .

As such , the protofilaments are not parallel to the projected outline of the hook , but run at a narrow angle following the 11 - start direction around the helical axis . This geometry , together with the cooperative synchronization of the two hinge regions on each subunit via inter - protofilament links by the D2 domains , can achieve the rotational mode required for efficient torque transmission as a flexible joint . The hook is not actually stress - free , but represents a ‘zero - stiff - ness’ structure 28 that is self - stressed without an overall change in strain energy as it goes through its motions , unless the overall cur - vature of the device is changed by using additional energy . However , it is necessary to point out that the hook presented in the present study is not under an active load—its superhelical curvature is a result of the chosen environmental conditions , such as low pH and temperature . Most likely , those environmental conditions are responsible for small chemical changes ( for example , protonation of acidic amino acid side chains ) that cause the structure to adopt its superhelical polymorphic state 29 . These environmental conditions may indeed be replaced by external forces when the motor - driven hook is under mechanical load during actual operation in the native environment of Salmonella enterica . online content Any methods , additional references , Nature Research reporting summaries , source data , statements of code and data availability and associated accession codes are available at https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41594 - 019 - 0301 - 3 .

Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium SJW880 30 was grown overnight in 1 l of LB medium at 37 °C . Cells harvested by low - speed centrifugation ( 5 , 000 r . p . m . for 10 min ) were gently suspended in 100 ml of sucrose solution ( 30 % sucrose , 100 mM Trizma ) on ice . A 10 ml volume of lysozyme solution ( 10 mg ml − 1 ) was added slowly over 5 min , followed by addition of 2 ml of 100 mM EDTA . After 10 min of gentle stirring , the suspension was warmed in a water bath at 30 °C , and then 5 ml of 10 % ( wt / vol ) n - dodecyl - N , N - dimethylamine - N - oxide ( LDAO ) were added . The suspension was stirred at room temperature until the DNA - induced viscosity had dissipated . Then , the supernatant was ultra - centrifuged ( 30 , 000 r . p . m . for 30 min ) . Pellets were resuspended in 5 ml water and sonicated using an ultrasound homogenizer ( Sonics Bibracells ) for 1 min at 5 s intervals . Undissolved aggregates were removed by low - speed centrifugation . The suspension was mixed with CsCl powder ( final concentration 33 % ) and subjected to high - speed centrifugation ( 20 , 000 r . p . m . , 14 h at 20 °C ) , and the thick pale protein band formed in the middle of the tube was collected with a glass pipette . After dialysis against two changes of water , polyhooks were collected by high - speed centrifugation to remove the CsCl , and resuspended in 2 ml of water . Cryo - electron microscopy specimen preparation . A 4 µ l volume of purified polyhook solution , at a concentration 3 . 0 mg ml − 1 , was applied to Quantifoil R1 . 2 / 1 . 3 grids pre - treated with H 2 / O 2 plasma ( Gatan Solarus ) . Grids were blotted and vitrified in liquid ethane , using a Vitrobot Mark IV system ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . Cryo - electron microscopy . Images of polyhooks in amorphous ice were acquired with a Titan Krios transmission electron microscope ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) operating at 300 kV at liquid nitrogen temperature , using a Falcon 3 direct electron detector in counting mode . Automatic data collection was performed with EPU software ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) ( Table 1 ) . Image processing . In total , 2 , 655 gain - normalized movie frames were aligned , dose - weighted and summed using MOTIONCOR2 31 . Subsequent image processing operations , including phase contrast transfer function ( CTF ) determination , were performed on summed images with cis TEM software 32 . Afterward , 1 , 742 images with good CTF fits to better than 5 Å resolution were used for automatic particle selection , using the ab initio algorithm of 998 , 061 particles at a box size of 512 2 pixels . 2D image classification into 100 classes resulted in 41 classes containing a total of 594 , 560 hook fragments . Unsymmetrized ab initio 3D reconstruction resulted in a map that reproduced the overall features of the hook , including its central channel , but contained artefacts caused by anisotropic insertion of image projections into the reconstruction at preferred orientations , such as an elliptical cross - section . We overcame this problem by generating an alignment reference with the IMAGIC 33 threed - create - volume command in the form of a smooth , supercoiled rod segment with roughly similar parameters ( option super _ coil , 0 . 3 turns , pitch 1 . 8 , radius 0 . 3 , thickness 0 . 1 ) . A subsequent global orientation search of the segmented hook particle images against this imperfect initial reference limited to 40 Å led to a more isotropic reconstruction at 12 Å resolution , which could be iteratively refined to 4 . 4 Å , such that the initial reference bias disappeared entirely . The reconstruction adopted a wider superhelical curvature , reproduced the polar character of the natural hook and clearly resolved secondary structure elements in 3D . The refinement was then continued with three classes , all of which showed very similar superhelical curvatures ( Supplementary Video 3 ) . The best class with the highest resolution ( 3 . 0 Å ) was then refined individually , including CTF refinement and likelihood blurring , to a final resolution of 2 . 9 Å ( FSC = 0 . 14 ) . No symmetry was applied . The reconstruction was figure of merit - weighted 34 and sharpened with an exponential B - factor of − 90 Å 2 . The final 3D map was normalized ( MAPMAN 35 ) and mirrored to match the handedness of the atomic subunit model . Atomic model building and refinement . To build an initial model of a single subunit of the hook , domains D1 ( residues 70 – 144 and 285 – 359 ) and D2 ( residues 144 – 285 ) from the X - ray crystal structure ( PDB 1WLG ) were independently fitted as rigid bodies into the reconstructed map using SITUS 36 ( program colores ) . Missing domains D0 ( residues 1 – 68 ) and Dc ( residues 360 – 402 ) were manually modeled de novo with COOT 37 and refined with PHENIX ( programs phenix . real _ space _ refine ) 38 to complete a single subunit model ( residues 1 – 402 ) . To expand the single model to cover the reconstructed map thoroughly , each domain ( D0 , D1 and D2 ) was separately fitted into the map and connections between the domains were rebuilt with MODELLER 39 ( program automodel ) . Initial hook models were iteratively refined with phenix . real _ space _ refine and rebuilt with COOT . The final model containing 66 subunits was evaluated with MOLPROBITY 40 and EMRinger 41 from the PHENIX suite . Structural analysis of the models was performed with PyMOL ( Schrödinger ) . Figures were prepared with PyMOL , UCSF Chimera 42 and UCSF ChimeraX 43 . Statistics and reproducibility . The 58 data points for each curve in Fig . 3 are based on model coordinates fitted into the cryo - EM reconstruction , which is an ensemble average of all single particle images ( Table 1 ) . The figure was created and the curves were fitted as sine waves using Igor Pro ( Wave Metrics ) . Only 58 from a total of 66 data points were used for visualization , because the sequential order of subunit assembly is discontinuous at the filament ends . A spreadsheet containing all 66 data points is available as a Supplementary data file . The resolution estimate ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) is based on independently refined datasets . Reporting Summary . Further information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article . Data availability The cryo - EM map of the curved hook has been deposited in the Electron Microscopy Data Bank under accession no . EMD - 9909 . The atomic coordinates of all 66 subunit models have been deposited in the wwPDB as a single file in mmCIF format under accession no . 6K3I .
