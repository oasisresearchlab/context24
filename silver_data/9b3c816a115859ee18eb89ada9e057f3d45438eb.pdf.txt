How the array of actin nucleators , elongators , and bundlers work together to orchestrate actin assembly when and where it is needed remains a key question ( Skau and Waterman , 2015 ) . Clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) in mammalian cells provides a striking ex - ample of the need for regulated actin assembly . Though it is well established that actin plays a critical role for endocytosis in yeast , where it drives inward invagination and fission of endocytic membranes ( Picco et al . , 2015 ) to - gether with the pulling action of myosin motors ( Lewellyn et al . , 2015 ) , in mammalian cells , the picture is more complicated . The degree to which actin assembly is required for CME differs depending on whether the clathrin - coated pits ( CCPs ) are bud - ding from adherent , glass - facing membranes or nonadherent , media - facing areas of the cell ( Yarar et al . , 2005 ) , and different cell types use actin to greater or lesser extents ( Fujimoto et al . , 2000 ; Mooren et al . , 2012 ) . One explanation is that the force from actin polymerization is used to aid deformation and scis - sion of the vesicle when membrane tension is high ( Aghamo - hammadzadeh and Ayscough , 2009 ; Ferguson et al . , 2009 ; Boulant et al . , 2011 ) . How this tension might be sensed to trig - ger actin assembly is unknown . Actin assembly is regulated by PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , the major signaling lipid in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane ( Saarikangas et al . , 2010 ; Michelot and Drubin , 2011 ) . During endocytosis , plasma membrane PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is dephosphorylated by the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 phosphatases , synaptojanin , and oculocerebro - renal syndrome of Lowe ( OCRL ) . The resulting PI ( 4 ) P product can be phosphorylated to PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 by the class II PI 3 - kinase , PI 3 - kinase C2 - α ( Posor et al . , 2013 ) , and then dephosphory - lated at position 4 by INPP4A , yielding PI ( 3 ) P , the hallmark of the early endosomal compartment ( Shin et al . , 2005 ) . Thus , during the budding of endocytic vesicles , a cascade of The conditional use of actin during clathrin - mediated endocytosis in mammalian cells suggests that the cell controls whether and how actin is used . Using a combination of biochemical reconstitution and mammalian cell culture , we elu - cidate a mechanism by which the coincidence of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and PI ( 3 ) P in a curved vesicle triggers actin polymerization . At clathrin - coated pits , PI ( 3 ) P is produced by the INPP4A hydrolysis of PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 , and this is necessary for actin - driven endocytosis . Both Cdc42 ⋅ guanosine triphosphate and SNX9 activate N - WASP – WIP - and Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin nucle - ation . Membrane curvature , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , and PI ( 3 ) P signals are needed for SNX9 assembly via its PX – BAR domain , whereas signaling through Cdc42 is activated by PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 alone . INPP4A activity is stimulated by high membrane curvature and synergizes with SNX9 BAR domain binding in a process we call curvature cascade amplification . We show that the SNX9 - driven actin comets that arise on human disease – associated oculocerebrorenal syndrome of Lowe ( OCRL ) deficiencies are reduced by inhibiting PI ( 3 ) P production , suggesting PI ( 3 ) P kinase inhibitors as a therapeutic strategy in Lowe syndrome .

How these lipid kinases and phosphatases are con - trolled to ensure proper spatial and temporal regulation of this cascade remains unknown .

Bars , 3 µm . membrane microenvironment in actin polymerization • Daste et al . 3747 by disease - causing mutations in OCRL . Deficiencies in OCRL cause Lowe syndrome , a multisystem genetic condition char - acterized by congenital cataracts , intellectual disability , and kidney absorption problems ( Bökenkamp and Ludwig , 2016 ) . OCRL is recruited to CCPs at late stages of CME and remains associated with early endosomes ( Ungewickell et al . , 2004 ; Vicinanza et al . , 2011 ) . Patient - derived cells exhibit defects in actin organization and endocytosis , with aberrant actin assem - bly on endosomes that rocket through the cytoplasm on actin comet tails ( Suchy and Nussbaum , 2002 ; Nández et al . , 2014 ) . Congruent with the kidney absorption defects , cultured human kidney 2 and patient proximal tubule cells display reduced trafficking through the early endosomal pathway , resulting in enlarged and PI ( 3 ) P - enriched structures that accumulate actin ( Vicinanza et al . , 2011 ) . Both PI 3 - kinases and synaptojanin are activated by high membrane curvature ( Hübner et al . , 1998 ; Chang - Ileto et al . , 2011 ) . Interestingly , several actin regulators that assemble at CCPs , including the adapter proteins SNX9 and TOCA - 1 , con - tain membrane curvature - sensing BAR domains . SNX9 and TOCA - 1 localize to sites of CME and are also candidates for regulating actin during endocytosis via clustering of the nucle - ation - promoting factor neural Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome pro - tein ( N - WASP ; Lundmark and Carlsson , 2003 ; Ho et al . , 2004 ; Itoh et al . , 2005 ; Soulet et al . , 2005 ; Tsujita et al . , 2006 ; Yarar et al . , 2007 ) . The isolated BAR – PX domain of SNX9 binds preferentially to membranes of high curvature ( Pylypenko et al . , 2007 ) , and a pathway from SNX9 to actin polymeriza - tion has been reconstituted from purified components ( Yarar et al . , 2008 ) . Actin polymerization downstream of TOCA - 1 is observed preferentially on larger , less curved vesicles in vitro , which are subsequently deformed to the desired curva - ture . Thus , TOCA - 1 – mediated actin assembly drives curva - ture rather than responding to it ( Takano et al . , 2008 ) . Whether SNX9 - mediated actin assembly is dependent on membrane cur - vature has not been tested . To determine how the membrane environment informs when and where actin is polymerized , we have dissected a path - way from phosphatidylinositol conversions and high membrane curvature through to actin polymerization in endocytosis . We find that high membrane curvature stimulates PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 dephos - phorylation by INPP4A and that the resulting PI ( 3 ) P in turn recruits SNX9 in conjunction with both PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and high membrane curvature . This three - way coincidence detection integrates the mechanics , lipid signaling , and protein cascades of CME to ensure its efficiency . We further propose that this signaling cascade can function to trigger actin assembly in re - sponse to delays in vesicle scission . Furthermore , we show that Lowe syndrome is a disease that mimics this membrane micro - environment , with the aberrant formation of a PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 / PI ( 3 ) P intermediate giving rise to actin comets . We demonstrate that the formation of actin comets in OCRL deficiency can be alle - viated by reducing PI ( 3 ) P levels using PI 3 - kinase inhibitors , suggesting a possible therapeutic strategy in Lowe syndrome . Results PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and PI ( 3 ) P signal actin polymerization via SNX9 Our previous work showed that the coincidence of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , PI ( 3 ) P , and membrane curvature stimulates actin polymerization in Xenopus egg extracts in an SNX9 - dependent manner ( Gallop et al . , 2013 ) . PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is a well - known activator of Cdc42 and N - WASP , and in turn the Arp2 / 3 complex . However , SNX9 has previously been implicated as an effector of PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 after it is produced by the sequential actions of synaptojanin and PI 3 - kinase C2 - α ( Posor et al . , 2013 ) . Therefore , to test the roles of PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 or PI ( 3 ) P in actin polymerization within a cytoplasmic environment , we developed a competitive assay that examines phosphatidylinositol preferences in the context of high - speed supernatant ( HSS ) frog egg extracts ( Fig . 1 B ) . HSS extracts provide a rich mixture of proteins necessary for early frog de - velopment and are depleted for endogenous membranes . Vesi - cles that contain either PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 plus PI ( 3 ) P or PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 plus PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 in a phosphatidylcholine ( PC ) and phosphatidylserine ( PS ) background were labeled with rhodamine - phosphatidy - lethanolamine ( PE ) or nitro - 2 - 1 , 3 - benzoxadiazol ( NBD ) – PE , respectively , as probes to distinguish the two vesicle popula - tions ( Fig . 1 B ) . To mimic the range of curvatures at a budding CCP , we prepared a continuous distribution of unilamellar ves - icles for each lipid composition , spanning a size range from 50 nm to 5 µm in diameter ( Fig . 1 B ) . The vesicles were mixed and mounted in a microscopy chamber , and HSS extracts supple - mented with Alexa Fluor 647 – labeled actin were added , with or without the addition of excess recombinant SNX9 . We observed dense accumulations of labeled actin at the vesicle surfaces that form actin comets , leading to vesicle motility ( Fig . 1 C ) . In - terestingly , comets formed exclusively from PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 / PI ( 3 ) P vesicles ( Fig . 1 C , purple vesicles ) . Within a competitive assay format , it is possible that the concentrations of actin regulatory proteins are limited and that PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 / PI ( 3 ) P is simply pre - ferred , rather than there being no activity arising from PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 . To distinguish between these possibilities and to provide an in - dependent assay format to test the activity of PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 , we per - formed pyrene actin assays with vesicles containing PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( which is needed to activate Cdc42 and N - WASP ) and PI ( 3 ) P or PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 . Consistent with the results from the competition assay , supplementing PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - containing vesicles with PI ( 3 ) P resulted in a substantial increase in both the rate and extent of actin polymerization , whereas the presence of PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 re - producibly inhibited actin polymerization ( Fig . 1 D ) . The in - hibitory effect could be caused by PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 - binding proteins within the HSS occluding PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - binding sites , thereby in - hibiting N - WASP or Cdc42 activation . However , the presence of PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 did not inhibit actin polymerization from PI ( 3 ) P / PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - containing vesicles ( Fig . 1 D ) . Even upon incorporation of 10 % PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 and with addi - tional SNX9 , actin comets failed to form on vesicles containing PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 ( Fig . 1 , E and F , cyan vesicles ; > 250 liposomes were analyzed for each condition ) . Interestingly , when excess SNX9 was added , the actin comets appeared to form preferentially on the small liposomes and always on those containing PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and PI ( 3 ) P ( Fig . 1 F , purple vesicles ) . Our in vitro findings are inconsistent with previous in vivo data suggesting that SNX9 is recruited to CCPs via its interac - tions with PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 ( Posor et al . , 2013 ) . To reconcile these dif - ferences , we considered that although PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 is not a direct upstream signal for actin polymerization by SNX9 in our model system , it could be a substrate for the production of PI ( 3 ) P via the action of INPP4A . To test this possibility , and also to con - firm the integrity of our PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 , we repeated the previous ex - periment and included a preincubation of PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 - containing liposomes with recombinant INPP4A , which may be limiting JCB • Volume 216 • NumBer 11 • 2017 3748 in our HSS . Confirming our hypothesis , actin comet tails then arose from both sets of vesicles that originally contained either PI ( 3 ) P or PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 ( Fig . 1 G ) . Therefore , rather than PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 being a direct agonist of SNX9 ( Posor et al . , 2013 ) for actin polymerization , we show that PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 hydrolysis provides a source of PI ( 3 ) P . Together , these data establish that SNX9 is preferentially recruited to liposomes bearing PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and PI ( 3 ) P where it triggers actin assembly . Identifying the minimum machinery required for SNX9 - regulated actin assembly We previously identified SNX9 , Cdc42 ⋅ GTP - γ S , and N - WASP as components necessary for PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 / PI ( 3 ) P - triggered actin polymerization ( Gallop et al . , 2013 ) . To determine whether these factors were sufficient , we reconstituted the pathway from purified components . SNX9 , Cdc42 ⋅ GTP - γ S , N - WASP ( pu - rified in its physiological complex with Wiskott - Aldrich syn - drome – interacting protein [ WIP ] , which is thought to be a more autoinhibted form ; Ho et al . , 2004 ) , the Arp2 / 3 complex , and actin were mixed , and actin polymerization was measured using either a pyrene actin assay to quantify the rate of actin polym - erization or a microscopy assay to directly visualize actin struc - tures . In a pyrene actin assay , significant actin polymerization was only observed on vesicles containing both PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and PI ( 3 ) P ( Fig . 2 , A and B ; protein purifications are shown in Fig . S1 , A – E ) . The GST - VCA domain of N - WASP , which triggers Arp2 / 3 complex – mediated actin polymerization independently of Cdc42 ⋅ GTP or BAR domain adapter protein regulation , was used as the positive control ( Fig . 2 A ) . Unlike previous reconsti - tutions with SNX9 that used N - WASP alone ( Yarar et al . , 2008 ) , Cdc42 was required under our assay conditions ( Fig . 2 B ) , likely because of the use of the N - WASP – WIP complex . To confirm these findings , we visualized the polymerization of actin directly at the membrane surface via confocal imaging of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 plus PI ( 3 ) P vesicles ( in a PC / PS background with rhodamine - PE as a probe ) together with all purified components and Alexa Fluor 647 – actin . The polymerization of actin over time was detected by the dense accumulation of labeled actin at the vesicle sur - faces ( Fig . 2 C ) . We also confirmed that Cdc42 must be in the GTP - bound state ( Fig . 2 D ) , and we visualized F - actin by EM , showing the disordered nature of the actin consistent with a highly branched Arp2 / 3 complex – generated network ( Fig . 2 E ) . Finally , conducting microscopy experiments in the absence of each individual component confirmed that ( a ) Cdc42 is essen - tial and that ( b ) removal of any other component also abolishes actin polymerization ( Fig . 2 , F – I ) . Thus , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , PI ( 3 ) P , Cd - c42 ⋅ GTP , N - WASP – WIP , Arp2 / 3 complex , and SNX9 are nec - essary and sufficient to trigger actin polymerization . Synergistic binding of two phosphoinositide lipids by SNX9 subfamily PX – BAR domains SNX9 has previously been shown to bind promiscuously to a variety of phosphoinositide lipids ( Pylypenko et al . , 2007 ; Yarar et al . , 2008 ) , each assayed independently . To look in more detail at the apparently synergistic binding of two phosphoinositide lipids , we probed the role of the adjacent BAR and PX domains in determining the ability of SNX9 to detect the coincidence of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and PI ( 3 ) P . By aligning Xenopus sequences with the existing crystal structure ( Fig . 3 A ; Pylypenko et al . , 2007 ) , we generated mutants in the proposed lipid - binding sites within the PX and BAR domains of Xenopus SNX9 and compared their lipid - binding specificities with the WT protein ( Fig . 3 B ) . Two mutants were generated : K511E / K517E ( Xenopus residue numbers ) , which make up a positively charged patch within the SNX9 BAR domain , and Y276A / K302A , which is present in the phosphoinositide lipid – binding pocket within the PX do - main ( Fig . 3 A ) . We first examined the binding of these mutants to PI ( 3 ) P - containing liposomes compared with WT protein ( Fig . 3 B ) . The weak binding observed with WT SNX9 was reduced to background levels seen with PC / PS liposomes by either of the mutations ( Fig . 3 B ) . Thus , both the PX and BAR domains contribute to weak PI ( 3 ) P binding with no apparent synergy . As previously reported for mammalian SNX9 ( Py - lypenko et al . , 2007 ; Yarar et al . , 2008 ) , Xenopus SNX9 bound more strongly to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - containing liposomes . Interestingly , this binding was unaffected by the PX domain mutation but was markedly inhibited by the BAR domain mutation . When PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and PI ( 3 ) P were presented together , the membrane – protein interaction was of substantially higher affinity , and then both the PX phosphoinositide lipid – binding pocket and the BAR domain made significant contributions to the interaction ( Fig . 3 B ; gels are shown in Fig . S2 A ) . These data thus support a model in which the PX – BAR domain encodes a dual speci - ficity phosphoinositide lipid – binding module that enables the coincident detection of two phosphoinositide lipids . SNX9 is a member of a subfamily of closely related sort - ing nexins that includes SNX18 and 33 ( Carlton et al . , 2005 ) , as well as a larger family that encodes PX – BAR domains ( Worby and Dixon , 2002 ) , but lacks the SH3 domain . These include SNX2 , 4 , 5 , and 8 , which function in trafficking from the early endosome to the TGN , plasma membrane , or late en - dosome ( Fig . 3 C ) . To determine whether synergistic binding to two lipid species was a unique property of the SNX9 subfamily , or rather of all PX – BAR modules , we expressed these proteins and examined their liposome - binding properties ( Fig . 3 D and Fig . S2 B ) . Though all the SNX PX – BARs interact with the membranes used , we could not detect specific double phospho - inositide selectivity testing against likely lipid combinations implied by their involvement in trafficking from endosomes ( Fig . 3 C ) . In contrast , sedimentation assays and Western blot - ting for SNX18 and 33 showed that these SNX9 subfamily members also preferentially bound to liposomes containing both PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and PI ( 3 ) P ( Fig . 3 E and Fig . S2 C ) . We verified these results using flotation assays instead of the sedimentation assay ( Fig . S2 , D and E ) . Although we have not tested all pos - sible combinations of phosphoinositide lipids , our assays using the most likely combinations indicate that dual phosphoinosit - ide lipid binding is likely a property unique to the SNX9 , 18 , and 33 subfamily of PX - BARs . Membrane curvature – dependent SNX9 binding and INPP4A activity combine to regulate actin polymerization The BAR – PX domain of SNX9 has previously been reported to preferentially bind smaller , highly curved liposomes via the curvature of the BAR domain and the insertion of an am - phipathic helix ( Pylypenko et al . , 2007 ) . Consistent with this , we previously observed SNX9 - dependent , curvature - sensitive actin polymerization on PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 / PI ( 3 ) P liposomes ( Gallop et al . , 2013 ) . Close examination of the microscopy images in Fig . 1 suggested that , compared with extracts alone , there was a drive toward actin polymerization from small , diffraction - lim - ited vesicles both when SNX9 was added and after hydrolysis of PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 by INPP4A ( Fig . 1 , compare E with F and G ) . We membrane microenvironment in actin polymerization • Daste et al . 3749 therefore explored this phenomenon further to better define the mechanism for membrane curvature sensing in the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 / PI ( 3 ) P pathway of actin polymerization . To measure the preference of SNX9 for binding small PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 / PI ( 3 ) P liposomes , we generated 100 - or 250 - nm mean diameter liposomes and used superresolution microscopy to directly measure their underlying size distribution . Lipo - somes were superresolved with point accumulation for imag - ing nanoscale topology ( PAI NT ) microscopy using Nile red , and their individual diameters were measured by fitting with a Figure 2 .

Schematic diagram showing putative double phosphoinositide compositions for trafficking between compartments where SNX PX – BAR domains are implicated . ( D ) Sedimentation assay of SNX2 , 4 , 5 , or 8 on liposomes that contain various double phosphoinositide lipid compositions . The liposome compositions were 5 % of each phosphoinositide with 65 % PC and 30 % or 25 % PS . Data are the mean of three independent liposome batches and sedimentation assays . No binding is above background suggesting that double phosphoinositide binding is a property specific to the SNX9 subfamily . membrane microenvironment in actin polymerization • Daste et al . 3751 two - dimensional Gaussian function ( Fig . 4 , A and B ; Sharonov and Hochstrasser , 2006 ) . By measuring the liposomes one by one , it is possible to directly extract both the entire size distribu - tion and total membrane area from a liposome count ( under the assumption that the liposomes are spherical ; Fig . S3 , A and B ) . Dynamic light - scattering data indicate a slightly larger size , as expected from the disproportionate effect of larger vesicles to the scattering ( Fig . S3 D ) . To determine a binding curve , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 / PI ( 3 ) P liposomes of each size distribution were incubated with increasing concentrations of SNX9 , and the fraction of lipo - somes with SNX9 bound was counted by two - color confocal imaging ( between 152 and 518 liposomes were counted for each condition ; Fig . 4 , A – C ) . Though measuring number alone shows some effect of curvature , saturating at 50 % of liposomes bound for 100 nm and 35 % bound for 250 nm ( i . e . , there are more binding sites for SNX9 present on more highly curved surfaces ) , the key measure is actually the surface area of mem - brane presented to a given concentration of SNX9 . Because the more highly curved liposomes are smaller , less surface area of membrane is present per liposome compared with less curved ones . To adjust for this , we calculated the surface area of mem - brane provided by the numbers of 100 - or 250 - nm liposomes recorded from the confocal images based on the size distribu - tions measured by PAI NT microscopy ( Fig . 4 A and Fig . S3 ) . The SNX9 binding curve reveals an ∼ 10 - fold increase in SNX9 binding per surface area on small liposomes ( Fig . 4 C ) . INPP4A is predicted to contain a double C2 domain ( Ivetac et al . , 2005 ) , which is known to confer curvature sensitivity in synaptotagmin ( Martens et al . , 2007 ) . We therefore assessed whether INPP4A activity exhibited curvature sensitivity . As shown in Fig . 4 D , the rate of hydrolysis of PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 to PI ( 3 ) P by recombinant INPP4A was approximately twofold faster for 100 - nm liposomes as compared with 250 - nm liposomes . Thus , as was shown for other lipid phosphatases and kinases , INPP4A phosphatase activity exhibits curvature sensitivity ( Fig . 4 D ) . Cdc42 guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity in extracts is not regulated by membrane curvature Various Cdc42 guanine nucleotide exchange factors contain BAR domains and are predicted to localize to regions of high membrane curvature . To test whether the activation of Cdc42 is dependent on either membrane composition or curvature , we assayed for the presence of Cdc42 ⋅ GTP ( i . e . , Cdc42 activa - tion ) on vesicles by sedimentation assays using the G protein – binding domain ( GBD ) from N - WASP ( which binds Cdc42 ⋅ GTP and not Cdc42 ⋅ GDP ) in the context of HSS . These experiments demonstrated that GBD recruitment occurs preferentially on PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - containing membranes as compared with PI ( 3 ) P - containing liposomes , but without any curvature sensitivity ( Fig . 4 E and Fig . S3 E ) . The addition of PI ( 3 ) P to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - containing liposomes had no further effect on Cdc42 activation . These data show that neither curvature nor synergy with PI ( 3 ) P triggers Cdc42 activation in the actin polymerization pathway ; rather , Cdc42 is triggered by PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 alone . Mechanism of membrane curvature – activated actin polymerization To assess the effects of the combined curvature dependence of SNX9 and INPP4A on actin polymerization on the surface of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 / PI ( 3 ) P liposomes , we adapted our competitive microscopy assay by using 100 - nm and 250 - nm distributed vesicles containing rhodamine - PE or NBD - PE , respectively , so that they could be distinguished in the images . Note that the vesicles are diffraction limited and will have different flu - orescent intensities depending on their position in the plane of focus as well as their size ( Fig . 5 , A – D ) . To obtain a base - line measure , we first incubated PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 / PI ( 3 ) P liposomes of both sizes with HSS ( Fig . 5 , A and E ) . The addition of SNX9 increased the number of 100 - nm liposomes that had a comet tail ( Fig . 5 , B and E ) without affecting 250 - nm li - posomes . This shows that the curvature selective binding of PI ( 3 ) P is transduced down the cascade of the actin regulatory network to actin polymerization itself . To assess the effect of the curvature selectivity of INPP4A , we performed the same assay with PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 / PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 liposomes , preincubating them with INPP4A before adding extracts . Compared with PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 / PI ( 3 ) P liposomes , there was an increase in the number of comet tails from 100 - nm liposomes , showing that PI ( 3 ) P pro - duction is limiting and again that the curvature sensitivity in PI ( 3 ) P formation is transduced down the cascade of the actin regulatory network ( Fig . 5 , C and E ) . Combining the effects of INPP4A activity with added SNX9 resulted in a further in - crease in actin polymerization on 100 - nm PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 / PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 liposomes , again without affecting polymerization on 250 - nm liposomes ( Fig . 5 , D and E ) . Altogether , these results provide evidence that at least two molecular mechanisms , SNX9 bind - ing and INPP4A activation , synergize to trigger actin polym - erization at sites of high membrane curvature . INPP4A is important for SNX9 recruitment to CCPs , revealing CME as a functional site of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 / PI ( 3 ) P actin polymerization As yet , no cellular role has been proposed for the coincidence detection of two phosphoinositide lipids and membrane cur - vature . The important combination of signals we identified for actin polymerization in frog egg extracts is evocative of endo - cytosis for several reasons . First , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is enriched at the plasma membrane , PI ( 3 ) P is produced at the early endosome , and membrane curvature increases during CCP maturation . Second , SNX9 is mainly recruited at the end of CCP matura - tion ( Taylor et al . , 2011 ; Posor et al . , 2013 ; Schöneberg et al . , 2017 ) and can induce actin polymerization , which has been im - plicated in the scission of endocytic vesicles ( Lundmark and Carlsson , 2009 ) . Finally , knockdown of the PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 phospha - tase INPP4A , which produces PI ( 3 ) P from PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 , has been seen to reduce transferrin uptake ( Shin et al . , 2005 ) . Moreover , although PI ( 3 ) P is more conventionally associated with early endosomes , PI ( 3 ) P is observed at the plasma membrane ( Ivetac et al . , 2005 ; Shin et al . , 2005 ) . Thus , we hypothesized that ( E ) Sedimentation assay of extracts with liposomes that contain 4 % PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ; 1 % PI ( 3 ) P ; or 4 % PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 / 1 % PI ( 3 ) P and 65 % PC ; and 30 , 34 , or 31 % PS with SNX9 , 18 , and 33 detected by Western blotting .

JCB • Volume 216 • NumBer 11 • 2017 3752 PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 is hydrolyzed to PI ( 3 ) P at very late stages of CCP maturation and that PI ( 3 ) P mediates SNX9 recruitment . To test whether hydrolysis of PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 by INPP4A is im - portant for recruitment of SNX9 and CME , HeLa cells stably expressing GFP - SNX9 at approximately twofold endogenous levels ( Fig . S4 , A and B ) , together with clathrin light chain – mCherry , were imaged using time - lapse total internal reflection fluorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy ( TIR FM ) . In control condi - tions , these cells recapitulate the previously reported kinetics of SNX9 recruitment ( Taylor et al . , 2011 ; Posor et al . , 2013 ) , in which SNX9 colocalizes with some CCPs shortly before their disappearance ( Fig . 6 A ) . In contrast , when levels of INPP4A are reduced using any of three separate siRNA sequences , there is a drastic drop in the number of SNX9 spots arising in the time - lapse experiments ( Fig . 6 B , Fig . S4 C , and Videos 1 and 2 ) . Quantifying the number of spots that appears per unit area showed a significant decrease ( Fig . 6 C ) . To confirm the spec - ificity of the RNAi treatment , we expressed siRNA - resistant murine INPP4A isoform 1 in INPP4A siRNA1 – treated cells and rescued the numbers of SNX9 spots ( Fig . 6 C and Fig . S4 D ) . Expression of INPP4A isoform 2 , which is missing the N - terminal C2 domain , failed to rescue SNX9 assembly ( Fig . 6 C ) . At the few CCPs that recruit SNX9 under INPP4A knockdown conditions , the SNX9 foci persisted for the same time as in WT cells , showing that INPP4A regulates recruitment rather than SNX9 lifetime at CCPs ( Fig . S4 E ) . Western blotting confirmed INPP4A depletion for each siRNA sequence and that endogenous and GFP - tagged SNX9 levels remained the same under all conditions ( Fig . 6 D ) . The extent to which CME depends on actin is variable between cell types and conditions and remains poorly under - stood . We measured the rate of transferrin uptake and found that INPP4A knockdown resulted in a modest but significant decrease ( Fig . 6 E ) . Interestingly , treatment of these cells with latrunculin A inhibited transferrin to a similar extent , whereas combining INPP4A knockdown and latrunculin A treatment appeared to compound the effect ( Fig . 6 E ) . As these inter - ventions are not complete , these data could suggest either that the two perturbations can both contribute to a single process or that there are INPP4A - independent ways in which actin is contributing to endocytosis . To measure the effects of INPP4A knockdown on the rate of CCP maturation , we quantified the Figure 4 . Membrane curvature - dependent SNX9 binding and INPP4A activity combine to regulate actin polymerization .

All error bars show SEM . membrane microenvironment in actin polymerization • Daste et al . 3753 dynamic , diffraction - limited CCPs using previously described software ( Aguet et al . , 2013 ) . As expected for HeLa cells as well as the larger clathrin plaques , numerous clathrin spots within the cells remain for a duration longer than the length of the video . The numbers of these persistent CCPs were unaf - fected by INPP4A siRNA ( Fig . 6 F ) . However , the mean life - time of the bona fide CCPs was increased ( Fig . 6 G ) from a mean of 24 . 3 s in control to 56 . 4 s for INPP4A siRNA1 , 35 . 9 s for siRNA2 , and 47 . 9 s for siRNA3 . These lifetime data are con - sistent with the inhibition of CME we detected by transferrin uptake . Thus , inhibiting the conversion of PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 to PI ( 3 ) P inhibits the recruitment of BAR domain protein SNX9 to CCPs and decreases the efficiency of CME . PI ( 3 ) P production and the INPP4A – SNX9 pathway are needed for actin comets in OCRL deficiency The activity and recruitment of PI 5 - phosphatase OCRL to very early endosomes to degrade PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is highly regulated by membrane curvature , protein – protein interactions , and Rab35 ( Billcliff et al . , 2016 ; Cauvin et al . , 2016 ) . SNX9 is also reported to directly interact with the OCRL ( Nández et al . , 2014 ) , sug - gesting a role in rocketing early endosomal intermediates into the cell . At the cellular level , mutations in OCRL , which cause Lowe syndrome and the less severe Dent - 2 disease , disrupt actin organization and lead to the formation of SNX9 - mediated comet tails propelling clathrin - coated vesicles through the cy - tosol in patient fibroblasts ( Nández et al . , 2014 ) . We therefore surmised that the defects in OCRL may be caused by dysregu - lation of the SNX9 actin assembly pathway defined herein and therefore could be disrupted by inhibiting PI ( 3 ) P production . As an almost complete depletion of OCRL expression is required to manifest endocytic defects ( Vicinanza et al . , 2011 ) and as PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 enrichment alone might also be expected to cause actin comets ( by recruiting SNX9 and Cdc42 ) , we sought a complete deficiency while also controlling the genetic back - ground of cells to create control and OCRL - deficient cells that were perfectly matched . We made retinal pigmented epithelial ( RPE - 1 ) cells deficient in OCRL and similar to mutations that occur in Lowe syndrome by targeting exon 9 using CRI SPR - Cas9 D10A nickase – based genome editing ( Fig . S5 , A – D ) . The OCRL - deficient cells recapitulated the actin comet phenotype previously characterized in patient fibroblasts as observed by expression of the fluorescent actin probe F - tractin using live - cell spinning - disk confocal microscopy ( Fig . 7 , A and B ; and Video 3 ) . Expression levels of SNX9 are unchanged in OCRL - deficient cells compared with control RPE - 1 cells ( Fig . 7 C ) . However , immunolabeling for the endogenous pro - tein revealed the accumulation of distinct SNX9 foci at the heads of the actin comets in OCRL knockout ( KO ) cells ( Fig . 7 , D and Figure 5 .

Expression of a murine mCherry - OCRL rescue construct abolished the appearance of these comets ( Fig . S5 , F and G ; and Video 4 ) . To reduce PI ( 3 ) P availability on the aberrant rocketing vesicles , we first targeted INPP4A , the endocytic source of PI ( 3 ) P we identified earlier . Treatment of OCRL KO cells with INPP4A siRNA resulted in a significant , ∼ 50 % decrease in the number of actin comets ( Fig . 7 , F – H ; and Video 5 ) . There was no difference in the mean duration , distance , or speed of the comets tracked . To more broadly inhibit PI ( 3 ) P production , we treated OCRL - deficient cells with either a broad range or a more specific class III PI 3 - kinase inhibitor . We used the irre - versible covalent inhibitor wortmannin , which targeted PI ( 3 ) P production by class I ( for example , via SHIP2 dephosphoryla - tion of PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ) , class III ( that phosphorylate phosphatidy - linositol on early endosomes ) , and class II PI 3 - kinases ( that are used during endocytosis to make PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 ) . To specifically inhibit class III PI 3 - kinases , which are of particular interest because of the late CCP / early endosome character of the rocket - ing intermediates , we used Vps34 - IN1 ( Bago et al . , 2014 ) .

( Values are the means ± SEM , and statistics were assessed by ordinary one - way ANO VA with Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test ) . Thus , these data suggest that ( a ) PI ( 3 ) P is needed for actin comet tail formation , ( b ) the PI ( 3 ) P arises from INPP4A and class III PI 3 - kinase routes of phosphoinositide conversion , and ( c ) PI 3 - kinase inhibitors may provide a therapeutic option for disease symptoms . Discussion We have discovered and fully reconstituted a SNX9 - depen - dent signaling pathway that links its unique ability to coinci - dently detect PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , PI ( 3 ) P , and membrane curvature with recruitment and activation of Cdc42 , N - WASP , and Arp2 / 3 complex to trigger actin polymerization ( Fig . 8 D ) . Given the well - established conversion of phosphatidylinositol that occurs during CME progression and the kinetic data on SNX9 ( Tay - lor et al . , 2011 ; Schöneberg et al . , 2017 ) , we propose that this pathway functions at late stages of CME , in concert with the curvature - dependent activity of the PI 4 - phosphatase INPP4A to activate actin assembly at stalled CCP intermediates . SNX9 has recently been localized to highly curved regions of late CCPs by high precision using correlative single - molecule lo - calization and EM , suggesting the coincidence of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and PI ( 3 ) P at late budding profiles ( Schöneberg et al . , 2017 ; Sochacki et al . , 2017 ) . Previous studies have suggested that PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 functions to recruit SNX9 to late - stage CCPs ( Posor et al . , 2013 ; Schöne - berg et al . , 2017 ) . However , our findings instead suggest that PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 serves as a substrate for the INPP4A phosphatase to generate PI ( 3 ) P that functions synergistically with PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 on the plasma membrane to recruit SNX9 and activate actin po - lymerization . Consistent with this , we show that INPP4A is necessary for SNX9 recruitment to CCPs . We reconstituted SNX9 - dependent actin polymerization from purified components to show that Cdc42 and N - WASP are both necessary and sufficient to activate the Arp2 / 3 complex in response to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 / PI ( 3 ) P signals . Cdc42 activation responds to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 but not PI ( 3 ) P or membrane curvature . SNX9 - me - diated actin polymerization has previously been reconstituted on PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 vesicles in a purified system similar to this one , but without Cdc42 ( Yarar et al . , 2007 ) . We speculate that the difference in these results comes from our use of the N - WASP – WIP complex , which is more strongly autoinhibited than free N - WASP , as used previously ( Yarar et al . , 2007 ) . The SNX9 PX – BAR domain is uniquely structured to in - tegrate all three combinatorial membrane signals . SNX9 binds to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - containing vesicles primarily via clusters of posi - tive charges on the BAR domain and with lower affinity to PI ( 3 ) P - binding sites via the PX domain . Both sites are necessary for the high - affinity binding to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 / PI ( 3 ) P - containing vesi - cles . In addition to specific lipid binding , we determined that SNX9 binds membranes of clathrin - coated vesicle – sized radius ∼ 10 - fold better than those of lower curvature . Interestingly , the ability to bind two phosphoinositide lipids synergistically appears to be conserved and unique among the closely related SNX9 / 18 / 33 subfamily but not shared by other more distantly related PX – BAR domain – containing sorting nexins . The curva - ture dependence of INPP4A activity in generating PI ( 3 ) P works in concert with SNX9 to drive actin polymerization of curved PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - and PI ( 3 ) P - containing membranes . During maturation and the inward budding of CCPs , their increasing curvature activates phosphatidylinositol modifica - tions via activation of synaptojanin ( Chang - Ileto et al . , 2011 ) , class II PI 3 - kinase ( Hübner et al . , 1998 ) , and OCRL ( Billcliff et al . , 2016 ) . We now show that this is also the case for a subsequent step , INPP4A hydrolysis of PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 to PI ( 3 ) P . The production of PI ( 3 ) P acts as a second messenger for curvature through the multistep enzyme catalysis . As binding to PI ( 3 ) P by SNX9 is also curvature dependent , these combinatorial inputs trigger a signaling cascade toward actin polymerization ( Fig . 8 D ) . To our knowledge , this work is the first demonstration of membrane curvature controlling a complex process ( Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerization ) downstream of an initial curvature - dependent event ( INPP4A catalysis and SNX9 binding ) . In CME , this signaling cascade could act as a timer : if ves - icle scission occurs rapidly , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , PI ( 3 ) P , and curvature will not coincide and thus , CME will be actin independent . However , if scission is delayed ( for example when membrane tension is high ) , the lifetime of this normally transient triple intermediate would be prolonged , allowing for SNX9 recruitment and the re - sulting actin polymerization to exert force on the membrane . The role of actin in CME has been debated but appears to be required at only a subset of CCPs ( Taylor et al . , 2011 ) or when membrane tension is high ( Boulant et al . , 2011 ) . Consistent with this model , we observed a significant but modest inhibition of CME in HeLa cells treated with INPP4A that was no greater than the effect of disrupting actin assembly with latrunculin A . SNX9 knockdown has been similarly shown to have a modest effect on CME in most cells ( Soulet et al . , 2005 ; Bendris et al . , 2016 ) . In agreement with our model , actin and SNX9 are co - opted when scission fails in dynamin KO cells ( Ferguson et al . , 2009 ) . Likewise , in COS - 7 cells , LifeAct fluorescence was ob - served during the final five frames of the clathrin signal at about half the budding CCPs , consistent with a model in which the triple PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 / PI ( 3 ) P / curved intermediate is only sometimes formed ( Li et al . , 2015 ) . In yeast , where actin is used constitu - tively , there is no SNX9 , and the molecular mechanism of actin involvement is different to the one we find here ( Lewellyn et al . , 2015 ) . Though we have provided initial data that the path - way we identified biochemically is relevant to studies of CME , much further work is needed to fully understand how the path - way we have identified functions during CME . In view of our model , it will be particularly interesting to determine whether INPP4A and SNX9 are more strongly required in cells where actin is always used during CME ( Grassart et al . , 2014 ) or in high membrane tension conditions , such as in clathrin plaques where actin is used for scission ( Boulant et al . , 2011 ) . Previous observations had revealed that OCRL - deficient cells have aberrant actin organization and that reducing the membrane microenvironment in actin polymerization • Daste et al . 3757 Figure 8 .

( D ) Pathway of curvature signaling to actin polym - erization via PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 / PI ( 3 ) P / SNX9 during CME . High curvature activates a cascade of phosphoinositol metabolism to change membrane identity and trigger actin polymerization at PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 / PI ( 3 ) P - enriched and highly curved sites via the oligomerization of SNX9 during endocytosis . In Lowe syndrome , OCRL deficiency increases PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels on PI ( 3 ) P intermediates , triggering SNX9 assembly . PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 also activates Cdc42 ( independently of the curvature ) for the relief of N - WASP inhibition . N - WASP oligomerization ( via SNX9 binding ) finally drives superactivation of the Arp2 / 3 complex and , thus , actin polymerization . JCB • Volume 216 • NumBer 11 • 2017 3758 levels of either N - WASP , SNX9 , or PI 5 - kinase , adding latrun - culin B , or overexpression of the actin - severing protein cofilin all rescued actin organization and endosomal trafficking defects ( Vicinanza et al . , 2011 ; Nández et al . , 2014 ) . Here , we have shown that the normally transient coincidence of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and PI ( 3 ) P is sustained in OCRL mutant cells and that the formation of actin comets on endocytic vesicles in OCRL mutant cells in - volves the SNX9 and INPP4A signaling cascade we have identi - fied . By editing the genome of RPE - 1 cells to mimic the OCRL deficiency in Lowe syndrome , we revealed that PI ( 3 ) P has a role in stimulating actin polymerization at the aberrant , still clathrin - coated ( Nández et al . , 2014 ) endocytic intermediates that rocket around these cells . siRNA knockdown and inhibitor studies established that not only is there a role for PI ( 3 ) P pro - duction via INPP4A , but also through PI 3 - kinases , particularly class III PI 3 - kinase . The effect of inhibiting PI ( 3 ) P production is substantial but not complete . This likely reflects the fact that actin polymerization can still be triggered by high PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ob - served in OCRL - deficient cells ( Vicinanza et al . , 2011 ) , which can still recruit SNX9 and activated Cdc42 . Nonetheless , these findings suggest the use of PI 3 - kinase inhibitors initially devel - oped for cancer indications as therapeutic approaches for Lowe syndrome ( Rodon et al . , 2013 ; Pasquier et al . , 2015 ) . We demonstrate here how a trio of coincident effectors , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , PI ( 3 ) P , and membrane curvature , operates transiently to amplify and transduce signals from the membrane to locally activate the actin machinery . Our work provides a novel mech - anism by which actin polymerization can be specifically trig - gered when and where it is needed in the cell . We show here that adapter proteins and the membrane environment can be critical factors driving actin polymerization at specific cellular locations . Arp2 / 3 complex – mediated actin nucleation is consti - tutively autoinhibited , and we demonstrate how a timed triple confluence of membrane signals unlocks an actin burst to power vesicle rocketing in health and disease .

Their concentrations were determined based on their absorption at 280 nm , and they were stored at − 80°C in 10 % glycerol after snap freez - ing in liquid nitrogen . Arp2 / 3 complex Bovine Arp2 / 3 complex was purified as previously described , except using GST - CA rather than GST - VCA ( Ho et al . , 2006 ) . Arp2 / 3 was purified from X . laevis egg extracts using a modified similar proto - col . Crude cytosolic extract was prepared as described previously ( Walrant et al . , 2015 ) , diluted 1 : 2 into MES buffer ( 100 mM MES , pH 6 . 8 , 0 . 2 mM EGTA , 0 . 5 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 1 mM EDTA , and 1 mM DTT ) , and centrifuged at 50 , 000 rpm for 1 h in a rotor ( 70Ti ; Beckman Coulter ) . The supernatant was collected and dialyzed into SP buffer ( 50 mM MES , pH 6 . 8 , 1 mM EDTA , 1 mM MgCl 2 , and 1 mM DTT ) in a 10 , 000 MWCO cassette ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) and then applied to a sulphopropyl fast flow ( SP FF ) column ( Hi Trap ; GE Healthcare ) on an ÄKTA flow pressure liquid chromatography ( FPLC ) system ( GE Healthcare ) . The column was washed with 10 mM KCl - SP buf - fer and then eluted with 80 mM KCl - SP buffer .

After extensive washing in buffer A / high salt buffer A ( 300 mM NaCl ) , the dialyzed SP column elution was applied to the GST - CA column . After extensive washing in 0 . 2 M KCl - GST - CA loading buffer , samples were eluted in a disposable column by the addition of 0 . 5 - ml aliquots of 0 . 2 M MgCl 2 - GST - CA loading buffer . Fractions containing Arp2 / 3 complex were pooled and underwent gel filtration on a gel filtration column ( HiLoad 26 / 600 Superdex 200 ; GE Healthcare ) into Arp2 / 3 storage buffer ( 10 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 4 , 50 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , and 1 mM DTT ) . 6×His - SNAP - SNX9 and SNX9 mutants , 6×His - mKate - wGBD , 6×His - mCherry - 2×FYVE , 6×His - eGFP - 2×PH - TAPP1 , and GST - SNAP - 2×FYVE pCS2 constructs were transfected into 293F cells by 293fectin reagent ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions 48 h before harvesting . 293F cell pellets were resuspended in buffer con - taining EDTA - free cOmplete protease inhibitor tablets ( Roche ) before lysis by probe sonication . pET and pGEX plasmids were transformed into BL21 pLysS E . coli and induced overnight at 19°C . Bacteria were harvested and lysed by probe sonication in buffers containing 150 mM NaCl and 20 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 4 , with 2 mM 2 - mercaptoethanol for 6×His tags and 2 mM EDTA and 2 mM DTT for the GST tag . After ultracentrifugation ( 40 , 000 rpm for 45 min in a 70Ti rotor ) , proteins were affinity purified on nickel – nitrilotriacetic acid ( Ni - NTA ) agarose beads ( Qiagen ) for the 6×His tag or GS beads ( GE Healthcare ) for the GST tag . GST proteins were cleaved using tobacco etch virus ( TEV ) protease . 6×His tag proteins were eluted from Ni - NTA beads by step - wise addition of increasing concentrations of 50 – 300 mM imidazole in a buffer also containing 20 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 4 , 150 mM NaCl , and 2 mM 2 - mercaptoethanol .

Cdc42 For expression of GST - Cdc42 , 293F cells were transfected as above , subcultured 48 h after transfection at a 1 : 2 ratio , and given a second transfection of the plasmid , with the cells harvested 24 h later . Iso - prenylated GST - Cdc42 was purified from the membranes of 293F pellets and loaded with GTP - γ S or GDP as described by Lebensohn et al .

Samples containing eluted protein were pooled and buffer exchanged by spin concentration into storage buffer . Iso - prenylated hexahistidine - tagged Q61L Cdc42 was extracted from the membranes of 293F pellets as for GST - Cdc42 and purified on Ni - NTA agarose beads as above . SNAP – N - WASP – ZZ - WIP SNAP - tagged X . tropicalis N - WASP in complex with ZZ - tagged human WIP was purified from 293F cells based on methods previously described ( Ho et al . , 2004 ) . The ZZ - WIP contains a TEV cleavage site between the tag and the protein . Lysates were incubated with IgG Sep - harose 6 beads ( GE Healthcare ) in XB buffer ( 100 mM KCl , 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM MgCl 2 , and 10 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 4 ) . After extensive wash - ing , TEV protease was added in XB buffer containing 10 mM DTT and 10 % glycerol and incubated overnight to cleave the N - WASP – WIP complex from the beads . The disposable column was drained to collect the cleaved protein complex and applied to a small volume of GS beads to sequester the TEV protease . Actin preparation procedure Actin was prepared according to the previously published protocol ( Pardee and Spudich , 1982 ) . The muscle from the leg of a freshly killed rabbit ( same day , kept on ice ) was taken , removing fat and connective tissue . The muscle was minced twice with a meat grinder and extracted in Guba Straub buffer ( 0 . 3 M NaCl , 0 . 1 M NaH 2 PO 4 [ 2H 2 0 ] , 5 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 1 mM NaN 3 , 0 . 05 mM PMSF , 1 mM MgCl 2 , and 1 mM Na 4 P 2 O 7 , pH to 6 . 5 , adding 1 ml of 200 mM ATP just before use ) , stir - ring consistently for 10 – 15 min . The muscle was centrifuged at 3 , 000 rpm in a J6 - MC centrifuge ( rotor TY . JS 4 . 2 ; Beckman Coulter ) pre - cooled to 4°C . The muscle residue was resuspended in 1 liter of buffer containing 4 % NaHCO 3 and 1 mM CaCl 2 plus 9 liters distilled H 2 O ( dH 2 O ) , stirred for 15 min and filtered through four layers of cheese - cloth . The muscle residue was diluted into 10 liters dH 2 O and quickly squeezed through cheesecloth ( working quickly as muscle swells at low ionic strength , and F - actin is converted to G - actin and would be lost ) . The residue was suspended in 2 . 5 liters of cold acetone , stirred at room temperature for 15 min , and then filtered through cheesecloth . Ace - tone washing and filtering was repeated until the supernatant became clear ( three to four times ) . The muscle powder was spread out on filter paper and dried in the fume hood overnight . Once dry , it was stored at − 80°C . Stringy parts of the muscle acetone powder were separated , and 5 g was weighed out and added to 100 ml of ice - cold G - buffer ( 2 mM Tris , pH 8 , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 5 mM NaN 3 , 0 . 2 mM Na 2 ATP , and 0 . 5 mM DTT ) . The mix was slowly stirred on ice for 30 min until viscosity increased . The suspension was carefully transferred into polycarbonate centrifuge tubes for the 70Ti rotor ( Beckman Coulter ) , topped up with G - buffer , and centrifuged at 20 , 000 g for 35 min at 4°C . The superna - tant was filtered through two small pinches of glass wool packed into the neck of a funnel and then filtered with a 0 . 45 - µm filter , followed by 0 . 22 - µm filters . At room temperature , a final concentration of 0 . 8 M KCl and 2 mM MgCl 2 was added . The actin was stirred slowly and consistently for 30 min at room temperature to let it polymerize and then stirred gently at 4°C to dissociate contaminating tropomyosin . The suspension was poured into tubes for the rotor ( 70Ti ) and centrifuged at 45 , 000 rpm ( 80 , 000 g ) at 4°C to sediment the F - actin . 1 – 2 ml G - buffer was added , and the pellet was gently resuspended using a Teflon - coated rod . The actin was homogenized and transferred to a dialysis cassette . The actin was dialyzed in the cold room against 1 liter of G - buffer and then dialyzed again overnight . Dialysis continued by changing the G - buffer three times , each over the next 2 d in the cold room . On day 4 , the dialysis buffer was changed two to three times over 4 h in the morn - ing . Then , the actin was centrifuged at 80 , 000 g for 2 h to sediment aggregates . A gel filtration column ( S200 ) was equilibrated with fresh G - buffer using an FPLC , and the G - actin was applied to the column and repeated as needed , avoiding the lower part of the tube containing the pellet of actin aggregates . The fractions were run on SDS - PAGE , and the pure actin - containing fractions were pooled and dialyzed into G - buffer minus NaN 3 . Sucrose was added to 5 % final concentration , and 5 - ml aliquots were snap frozen , dried in a freeze dryer , and stored at − 80°C . Cold dH 2 O was added to resuspend the actin , which was then able to be stored on ice for up to 1 mo . Lipid protonation and liposome preparation All lipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids ( natural brain lip - ids for PC , PS , and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , and synthetic for PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 and PI ( 3 ) P ) , apart from C16 - NBD – labeled PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 [ Echelon Biosciences ] , which was a gift from P . Vecino , Tebu - Bio ) . Phosphoinositide powders were resuspended in CHCl 3 , dried under a stream of nitrogen , and desiccated for 1 h . The lipid film was resuspended with 2 CHCl 3 / 1 MeOH / 0 . 001 1N HCl , incubated for 15 min , dried under nitrogen , and desiccated for 1 h . The lipid film was then resuspended with 3 CHCl 3 / 1 MeOH , dried under nitrogen , resuspended with CHCl 3 , dried under nitrogen , and fi - nally resuspended with CHCl 3 at 1 mg / ml and stored at − 20°C . Lipo - some samples for microscopy experiments ( with a broad size distribution from 50 nm to 5 µm ) were prepared at a 1 - mM total lipid concentration by mixing lipid chloroform / methanol stocks as appropriate ( with 0 . 2 % rhodamine - PE or 0 . 6 % NBD - PE ) in a glass test tube and drying with ni - trogen and then under vacuum for 1 h . Lipid films were resuspended in a sucrose solution with an osmolarity equivalent to XB buffer ( 204 mosM ) and then shaken vigorously on a vortexer for 30 min at room tempera - ture . Giant unilamellar vesicles were prepared from these samples by freeze / thawing in liquid nitrogen / 37°C water bath five times ( Traïkia et al . , 2000 ) , followed by gentle centrifugation to discard small liposomes and membrane residues . In parallel , large unilamellar vesicles and small unilamellar vesicles were prepared from the same sample by freeze / thawing as above eight times , followed by extrusion 15 times , initially through an 800 - nm polycarbonate filter and then a 50 - nm polycarbonate filter ( Mini - Extruder ; Avanti Polar Lipids ) . The giant , large , and small unilamellar vesicle samples were mixed together ( molar ratio 3 : 1 : 1 ) and stored at 4°C before observation . SUV samples for sedimentation assays and microscopy assays were prepared at a 1 - mM total lipid concentration by mixing lipid stocks as appropriate in a glass test tube and drying with nitrogen and then under vacuum for 1 h . Lipid films were resuspended in XB buffer for sedimentation assays or a sucrose solution with an osmo - larity equivalent to XB buffer ( 204 mosM ) for microscopy assays and then shaken vigorously on a vortexer for 30 min at room temperature . Li - posomes were prepared by freeze / thawing in liquid nitrogen / 37°C water bath eight times followed by extrusion 15 times initially through an 800 - nm polycarbonate filter to prepare the largest liposomes and then a 100 - nm polycarbonate filter . Loss of lipids during filtering was quantified using SDS - PAGE and Coomassie staining , after which the lipid concen - tration of the 100 - nm vesicles was adjusted to match the 800 - nm sample . membrane microenvironment in actin polymerization • Daste et al . 3761 Liposome size and surface area determination by PAI NT and analysis Superresolution imaging was performed using a home - built TIRF mode based on an inverted optical microscope ( IX73 ; Olympus ) and coupled to an electron - multiplied charged - coupled device ( EMC CD ) camera ( Evolve II 512 ; Photometrics ) . A continuous wave diode - pumped sol - id - state laser operating at 532 nm ( LAS OS ; Lasertechnik GmbH ) was used as the excitation light source to induce fluorescence in the Nile red molecules . The laser was prepared to circularly polarized light by a quarter wave plate and directed off a dichroic mirror Di02 - R532 - 25 × 36 for 532 nm of illumination ( Semrock ) through a high numerical aperture oil - immersion objective lens ( Plan Apochromat 60× NA 1 . 49 ; APON 60× OTI RF ; Olympus ) to the sample coverslip . Total internal reflection was achieved by focusing the laser at the back focal plane of the objective , off axis , such that the emergent beam at the sample interface was near collimated and incident at an angle greater than the critical angle θ c ∼ 67 ° for a glass / water interface for TIRF imaging . This generated an ∼ 50 - µm diameter excitation footprint with power densities in the range of ∼ 0 . 5 kWcm − 2 at the coverslip . The emitted fluorescence was collected through the same objective and further fil - tered using a longpass filter ( BLP01 - 532R - 25 ; Semrock ) , a bandpass filter ( FF01 - 650 / 200 - 25 ; Semrock ) , and a shortpass filter ( FF01 - 715 / SP - 25 ; Semrock ) for 532 nm of illumination before being expanded by a 2 . 5× relay lens ( PE 2 . 5× 125 ; Olympus ) . The fluorescence image was captured on the EMC CD camera running in frame transfer mode at 20 Hz , with an electron multiplication gain of 250 , operating at − 70°C with a pixel size of 16 µm and automated using the open source micros - copy platform Micromanager . Nile red ( N1142 ; Thermo Fisher Scien - tific ) stock solutions were prepared by dissolving Nile red into DMSO ( D2650 > 99 . 7 % purity ) to a concentration of 1 mM . The stock solution was divided into 10 - µl aliquots , flash frozen in liquid N 2 , and stored in the dark at − 80°C until required . For a working solution , the aliquot was diluted into the filtered XB buffer to a final concentration of 50 nM . For the observation chamber , glass coverslips ( 0 . 13 - mm thickness , 22 × 22 mm , VWR collection , 631 – 0124 ) were cleaned by using an argon plasma cleaner ( PDC - 002 ; Harrick Plasma ) for at least 1 h . After that , frame - seal slide chambers ( 9 × 9 mm ; BioRad ) were firmly af - fixed to the cleaned glass coverslips . The chamber was covered with poly - l - lysine solution ( 0 . 01 % wt / vol , P4832 - 50ML ) to fully coat the coverglass surface , incubated for 30 min , and then washed at least four times with the filtered XB buffer . After that , the chamber was covered by the filtered XB buffer to prevent any contaminations of the covers - lip’s surface until loaded with the liposome samples . To determine the liposome size , 500 nM ( 100 - nm liposomes ) and 1 µM ( 250 - nm lipo - somes ) concentrations were added to the chamber and incubated for 10 min , and then 1 µl of the working Nile red solution ( 50 nM ) was added to the chamber to a final concentration of 1 nM . Superresolution images of 100 - nm and 250 - nm liposomes on a glass surface were observed during 2 , 000 frames at a frame rate of 20 ms . Nile red localizations in the image were determined using the Peak Fit plugin for ImageJ ( National Institutes of Health ) . Individual liposome diameters in the su - perresolution image were determined by calculating the full width half maximum ( FWHM ) from the standard deviation of a two - dimensional Gaussian fit . With the FWHM value , we calculated the surface area ( A ) of individual liposomes using the equation A = 4 πr 2 ≈ 4π ( FWHM _ _ _ _ _ _ 2 ) 2 . Liposome size determination by dynamic light scattering Liposome samples were measured by dynamic light scattering using a molecular size analyzer ( Zetasizer Nano ZS ; Malvern Instruments ) , with liposomes at a 150 - mM final concentration in XB buffer . The size distribution output in intensity was converted into number distribution using the Zetasizer software transformation method , with the following parameters : shell refractive index at 1 . 43 , particle core refractive index at 1 . 33 , and core radius / shell ratio at 20 for 400 - nm extruded liposomes and 10 for 100 - nm extruded liposomes . Samples were stored on ice before sedimentation assays . Liposome in vitro imaging and analysis The observation chamber was prepared by adding a 50 - µl drop of 5 % BSA solution ( wt / vol , in water , filter with 0 . 22 - µm membranes ) to a silicon gasket on a coverslip and incubating for 1 h , after which the area was extensively rinsed with XB buffer . To test for SNX9 binding , 45 µl of XB was applied to the chamber , followed by 3 µl liposome mix ( rhodamine - PE labeled ) , which was left for 5 – 10 min to sediment , after which 125 nM ( final ) Alexa Fluor 647 – SNAP - SNX9 was slowly in - jected on top of the sample , and several representative regions were im - aged ( immediately after injection ) . To test for actin polymerization in the presence of frog egg extract , 22 µl XB was applied to the chamber , followed by 3 µl liposome mix , which was left to sediment for 5 – 10 min . 35 µl of reaction mix was prepared in XB containing ( final assay concentration after addition to liposome mix ) energy mix ( 5 . 25 mM phosphocreatine , 0 . 7 mM ATP , 0 . 7 mM MgCl 2 , pH 7 , 2 mM DTT , 3 . 5 mg / ml HSS frog egg extract , 0 . 8 mM unlabeled actin , 0 . 3 mM Alexa Fluor 647 – labeled actin , and ±100 nM SNX9 ) . These were added to the sample , and several representative regions were imaged after 10 min of incubation . To test the activity of the phosphatase INPP4A , the same protocol was used , except that liposome samples were pre - incubated with the enzyme before sedimentation ( 20 nM final ; 1 h at 25°C in the dark ) . To examine actin polymerization in the presence of the minimal purified system , 21 µl XB was applied to the chamber , followed by 3 µl liposome mix , which was left to sediment for 5 – 10 min , after which a final assay concentration of 50 nM GTP - γ S – loaded Cdc42 was gently added on top of the sample . 25 - µl reaction mixes were prepared in XB containing ( final assay concentration ) 0 . 2 mM ATP , 2 mM DTT , 8 µM unlabeled actin , 0 . 3 µM Alexa Fluor 647 – labeled actin , 50 nM X . laevis Arp2 / 3 complex , 100 nM SNX9 , and 100 nM N - WASP – WIP and were added to the sample , and several repre - sentative regions were imaged after 10 min of incubation . Images were analyzed using MetaMorph software . Sedimentation assays For SNX9 ( WT and mutants ) , SNX2 , SNX4 , SNX5 , SNX8 , SNX18 , and SNX33 , 20 µl liposomes ( 1 mM total lipid ) was mixed with pro - teins ( 1 . 5 µM final ) in a 100 - µl final volume of XB . These were incu - bated for 20 min at room temperature , followed by ultracentrifugation at 120 , 000 g ( TLA - 100 rotor ; Beckman Coulter ) . For Cdc42 activation , 25 µl liposomes ( 1 mM ) were mixed with HSS ( 3 . 5 mg / ml final ) and mKate GBD ( 10 nM final ) . These were incubated for 15 min at room temperature , followed by ultracentrifugation at 120 , 000 g . Superna - tants and pellets ( resuspended in 100 µl XB ) were collected and ana - lyzed by SDS - PAGE Coomassie staining ( SNX9 ) or Western blotting ( mKate - GBD ) . Quantification was performed using the LI - COR imag - ing system and Image Studio software . INPP4A phosphatase thin - layer chromatography ( TLC ) assay Silica TLC plates ( Merck Millipore ) were preimpregnated in a solu - tion of 2 mM EDTA and 1 % potassium oxalate / MeOH ( 2 : 3 ) . 48 % PC / 47 . 5 % PS / 4 % PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 / 0 . 5 % C16 - NBD PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 liposomes were prepared to a 2 - mM total lipid concentration and extruded through 100 - nm or 800 - nm polycarbonate filters . The 800 - nm extruded population had a mean diameter of 250 nm . 110 µl of each liposome suspension was incubated with 10 nM INPP4A at room temperature in the dark JCB • Volume 216 • NumBer 11 • 2017 3762 in a buffer containing 150 mM NaCl , 20 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 4 , 2 mM EDTA , and 5 mM CaCl 2 . 10 - µl samples were taken after 0 , 1 , 2 , 5 , 10 , 20 , 30 , 60 , 90 , 120 , and 150 min and immediately boiled to inactivate the enzyme . For each time point sample , lipids were extracted by add - ing 10 µl chloroform , shaking vigorously , and the organic phase was collected . The extraction was repeated , and the organic phases were pooled , with 10 µl lipid solution in chloroform for each time point spot - ted on a TLC plate . The plate was eluted with 65 % propan - 1 - ol / 35 % 2 M acetic acid for several hours in the dark , after which the plates were read on a phosphorimager ( Fujifilm ) with the band intensity analyzed using the gel tool in ImageJ . Graphs were made in Excel ( Microsoft ) . Pyrene actin assays Pyrene actin assays were performed using the purified minimal recon - stituted system based on a previous protocol ( Ho et al . , 2006 ) . Actin was purified as previously described ( Pardee and Spudich , 1982 ) . 100 - µl assay mixes were prepared in a quartz cuvette by adding components in the following order : 10× assay buffer ( 500 mM KCl , 100 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 4 , 20 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM ATP , and 2 mM DTT ) , 100 µM ( total lipid concentration ) liposomes , 500 nM Q61L Cdc42 , 100 nM SNX9 , 100 nM N - WASP – WIP , and 50 nM bovine Arp2 / 3 complex , with reac - tions started by the addition of a 67 % unlabeled / 33 % pyrene actin mix at a final actin concentration of 1 . 2 µM . For each series of experiments , a negative control of background actin polymerization in assay buffer and a positive control of using GST - VCA to activate the Arp2 / 3 com - plex were performed . Polymerization curves were collected on a spec - trophotometer ( FluoroMax - 4 ; Horiba Scientific ) and analyzed in Excel . Transmission EM Samples were prepared as for the liposome minimal purified system microscopy assay and verified for actin aster formation by fluorescence microscopy immediately before negative staining . Small drops of sam - ples were dotted onto dental film and glow discharged , and formvar - car - bon – coated EM grids ( provided by the Cambridge Advanced Imaging Centre , University of Cambridge ) were inverted onto the samples for 2 min , after which they were quickly spotted on filter paper and imme - diately transferred to a spot of 3 % aqueous uranyl acetate for 1 min . Excess negative stain was removed with filter paper , and the grids were allowed to dry before imaging on a transmission electron microscope ( Tecnai G2 ; 80 – 200 kv ) . Images were cropped in Photoshop ( Adobe ) . Fluorescence microscopy For liposome in vitro analysis , confocal images were acquired on an in - verted microscope ( Ti - E ; Nikon ) equipped with spinning - disk ( X - light Nipkow ; Crest ) , 250 - µm piezo - driven Z stage / controller ( NanoScanZ ) and Lumencor Spectra X LED illumination using a 100× 1 . 40 oil objec - tive ( Plan Apo VC ; Nikon ) . Images were collected at room temperature with an EMC CD ( Evolve Delta ; Photometrics ) camera in 16 - bit depth using Metamorph software version 7 . 8 . 2 . 0 . Alexa Fluor 488 , 568 , and 647 samples were visualized using 470 / 40 , 560 / 25 , and 628 / 40 exci - tation and 525 / 50 , 585 / 50 , and 700 / 75 emission filters , respectively . Live - cell imaging of actin comets in RPE - 1 cells was performed on the same microscope supplemented with a stage top heated chamber ( Okolabs ) at 37°C . Cells were grown in glass - bottomed dishes ( Ibidi ) , transfected as outlined above , and imaged in phenol red – free media containing 20 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 4 . Confocal imaging of immunola - beled cells was performed on a laser - scanning microscope ( FV1000 ; Olympus ) using a 100× UPlanSApo 1 . 4 oil objective controlled by FV10 - ASW software version 4 . 2 . Alexa Fluor 488 , 568 , and 647 sam - ples were imaged at room temperature using laser excitation lines at 488 , 561 , or 635 nm and the standard FV1000 photomultiplier tube detectors with emission windows set to 500 – 545 nm , 570 – 625 nm , and 655 – 755 nm , respectively . For live - cell imaging of CME in HeLa cells , cells were grown and transfected according to standard protocols on uncoated MatTek dishes . Experiments were conducted using a growth chamber ( 37°C , 5 % CO 2 ) in connection with an A1 R laser - scanning confocal microscope system with an EMC CD camera ( AND OR iXon ; Nikon Instruments ) under control of the NIS - Elements microscope im - aging software , allowing real - time TIRF acquisitions with a 100× lens ( Apochromat 1 . 49 oil 0 . 13 – 0 . 20 DIC N2 ; Nikon ) . Analysis of CME in HeLa cells The representative microscopic images viewed in the figures were drift corrected using ImageJ and prepared ( cropped , rotated and linearly adjusted for intensity ) using Photoshop CS5 . Spots of GFP - SNX9 or clathrin - Lca - mCherry after siRNA transfection were evaluated by ana - lyzing TIRF live - cell acquisitions ( 800 ms between frames , over 193 s ) using the Imaris software V7 . 5 ( Bitplane ) , tracking mode . A region of interest sized 100 × 100 pixels ( 256 µm 2 ) was segmented for spots using an estimated diameter of 0 . 4 µm , background subtraction , a filter using a quality threshold > 102 , Brownian motion , maximum distance of 0 . 7 µm , maximum gap size of 1 , no fill gap , and a track duration minimum of 32 s . Graphs were made in Excel and Prism ( GraphPad ) . Analysis of persistent CCPs and endocytic lifetimes was performed in MatLab ( MathWorks ) using custom - written software ( Aguet et al . , 2013 ) . The latest software is available for download from M . Mettlen . In brief , the analysis focuses on diffraction - limited objects , and the detection of all clathrin - labeled structures is based on the assumption that all relevant fluorescent signals can be described by a Gaussian point spread func - tion . Signals were selected as valid detections if their amplitude was higher than a 95th percentile confidence threshold in the local back - ground noise distribution . Fluorescent trajectories were automatically calculated from the detections obtained in individual frames , and bona fide CCPs that undergo stabilization and maturation were distinguished from transient subthreshold clathrin - labeled structures based on quan - titative analysis of the progression of their fluorescence intensity during early stages of growth , as previously described ( Aguet et al . , 2013 ) . The lifetimes ( i . e . , time elapsed between first and last detection of a given trajectory ) of these bona fide CCPs were then extracted and plot - ted . Tracks were categorized as persistent if their diffraction - limited fluorescent signal was present throughout the entire acquisition period ( i . e . , present in the first and last frames of the time lapse ) . Transferrin internalization assay Flp - In TRex GFP - SNX9 HeLa cells were treated with 60 nM stealth siRNA ( Invitrogen ) for 72 h before uptake . The day before the assay , 10 5 cells / well were seeded on coverslips in 24 - well plates and induced with 1 ng / ml doxycycline ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . Cells were pretreated with 1 µM latrunculin A ( Sigma - Aldrich ) or DMSO in medium for 10 min at 37°C immediately before addition of transferrin . Medium with 8 µg / ml 650 - s - s - transferrin together with DMSO or 1 µM latrunculin A was then added to each well . After a 10 - min incubation at 37°C , the medium was removed and cells were quickly washed once with PBS followed by cell fixation for 20 min with 3 % PFA in PBS at room tem - perature . Cells were then washed once in 4°C stripping buffer ( 100 mM NaCl , 50 mM Tris - HCl , and 2 . 5 mM CaCl 2 , pH 8 . 7 ) and incubated two times for 20 min with freshly prepared 100 mM Mesna ( Sigma - Aldrich ) in stripping buffer . Cells were then incubated with 1 : 25 , 000 DAPI in PBS for 15 min and mounted for microscopy . Z stacks of the samples were imaged with a spinning - disk confocal live - cell imaging system ( Cell Observer ; Zeiss ) , controlled by ZEN interface with an inverted microscope ( Observer . Z1 ; Axio ) and equipped with a spin - ning - disk unit ( CSU - X1A 5000 ) and an EMC CD camera ( iXon Ultra ; AND OR ) . Endosomes were segmented as spots using IMA RIS . Total membrane microenvironment in actin polymerization • Daste et al . 3763 intensity of detected endosomes in the Z stacks was divided by the amount of cells in the image ( DAPI ) . Data were prepared , analyzed , and presented in Excel and Prism . Tracking analysis of actin comets in RPE - 1 OCRL KO cells Images were captured as a small Z series ( 4 × 0 . 2 µm ) , taken every 2 s over a 4 - min period . Representative images and videos show a maximal projection of this Z stack and were prepared in FIJI ( ImageJ ) . FIJI was also used to create the temporally color - coded images ; the representative videos were bleach corrected , and a maximal projection of the Z stack was created . Background subtraction was performed by creating a mean intensity projection of the entire time course and subtracting this from each individual frame . The resulting stack was fed into the Temporal Color - Code plug - in using the ice LUT to create the images presented . Comet tracking analysis was performed using the Trackmate plug - in in FIJI . Images were blinded before analysis and then processed to isolate moving comets and allow the plug - in to detect them . Each image was converted to a Z series maximal projection . The triangle threshold function was used to identify cells in the image , followed by an erosion function to remove outer processes ( such as filopodia or membrane ruffling , which the plug - in could detect as motile puncta and attempt to track ) . This region was isolated , and the area of interest was recorded . After this , a stack of the difference between adjacent frames in this isolated region was created to isolate objects that had moved . This was analyzed using the Trackmate plug - in . Images were analyzed using the LoG detector with the median filter and subpixel localization turned on . Spots representing comet heads were detected using an estimated blob diameter of 0 . 75 µm , and an appropriate threshold was set manually . Identified blobs were determined as comets by tracking their movement using the Simple LAP tracker , using a maximum linking distance of 2 . 4 µm ( determined by manually tracking a selection of control comets from several reference cells ) , with no gap closing . Detected tracks were cate - gorized as comets when they persisted for 8 s or longer ( five consecutive frames ) , with the number detected for each region recorded . The dura - tion , track displacement , and mean track speed for all the comets in the image were also recorded . For data analysis , each cell region represents the number of comets detected in an individual image . These normally come from a single cell , but can include more than one cell when neigh - boring cells are also expressing F - tractin and therefore included after the thresholding step , with the data expressed as the number of tracks detected / thresholded area ( micrometers squared ) / total time ( minutes ) . Graphs and statistical analysis were prepared using Prism software . Immunolabeling of RPE - 1 OCRL KO cells Cells grown on coverslips were fixed based on the Golgi fixation pro - tocol outlined by Hammond et al . ( 2009 ) . Washes were performed be - tween each step . Cells were fixed in 2 % PFA ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) in PBS for 15 min and permeabilized in 20 µM digitonin ( Sigma - Al - drich ) in buffer A ( 150 mM NaCl , 20 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 4 , and 2 mM EDTA ) for 5 min . Cells were blocked in 5 % goat serum ( in buffer A ; Sigma - Aldrich ) for 45 min and then treated with primary antibody for 1 h ( in 0 . 5 % goat serum in buffer A ) , followed by secondary antibody for 30 min , before being postfixed in 2 % PFA for 5 min . Coverslips were mounted onto slides using Hydromount ( National Diagnostics ) . To label PI ( 3 ) P , purified mCherry - 2×FYVE was added during the blocking step at a final concentration of 1 µg / ml and then immunolabeled using an RFP primary antibody and Alexa Fluor 568 secondary antibody . Images were captured as a laser - scanning confocal Z series ( 10 × 0 . 2 µm ) and are displayed as a maximal projection of this stack , prepared in FIJI . OCRL actin comet inhibitor treatments Wortmannin ( Sigma - Aldrich ) and Vps34 - IN1 ( Selleck Chemicals ) were made up in DMSO at 2 - and 10 - mM stock concentrations , re - spectively . Cells were treated with wortmannin at a final concentration of 2 µM , Vps34 - IN1 at 10 µM , and DMSO at an appropriate 1 : 1 , 000 dilution in serum - free media 1 h before analysis .
