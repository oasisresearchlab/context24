An emerging mechanism for biological organization , particularly within the crowded nucleus , is biomolecular phase separation into condensed droplets of protein and nucleic acids . However , the way in which chromatin impacts the dynamics of phase separation and condensate formation is poorly understood . Here , we utilize a powerful optogenetic strategy to examine the interplay of droplet coarsening with the surrounding viscoelastic chromatin network . We demonstrate that droplet growth dynamics are directly inhibited by the chromatin - dense environment , which gives rise to an anomalously slow coarsening exponent , ùõΩ ~ 0 . 12 , contrasting with the classical prediction of ùõΩ ~ 1 3‚ÅÑ . Using scaling arguments and simulations , we show how this arrested growth can arise due to subdiffusion of individual condensates , predicting ùõΩ ~ ùõº / 3 , where ùõº is the diffusion exponent . Tracking the fluctuating motion of condensates within chromatin reveals a subdiffusive exponent , ùõº ~ 0 . 5 , which explains the anomalous coarsening behavior and is also consistent with Rouse - like dynamics arising from the entangled chromatin . Our findings have implications for the biophysical regulation of the size and shape of biomolecular condensates , and suggest that condensate emulsions can be used to probe the viscoelastic mechanical environment within living cells . Introduction Liquid - liquid phase separation ( LLPS ) has emerged as a common assembly mechanism within living cells 1 , 2 . LLPS drives formation of a multitude of biomolecular condensates such as nucleoli 3 , stress granules 4 , and P granules 5 . Phase separation of proteins typically relies on multivalent interactions , and many efforts have been made to understand the role of self - interactions via intrinsically disordered protein regions ( IDRs ) 6 , and heterotypic interactions , often mediated by folded protein - protein interaction domains and oligomerized RNA ( or other substrate ) binding domains . The condensates that result from these interactions are multicomponent structures , which range from compositionally homogeneous liquid - like structures , to multiphase liquids and kinetically arrested gel states 7 ‚Äì 9 . Their structural features and material properties are thought to enable a diversity of functions , ranging from increasing reaction rates by concentrating reactants , to inhibiting reactivity through sequestration , and even structurally rearranging their environment 1 , 10 . Many phase - separated condensates appear to exhibit stable sizes dependent on cell type 11 , 12 . It is unclear how these sizes are maintained , since liquid compartments should not have an intrinsic size scale . Rather , given enough time , individual liquid condensates should coalesce to form a single , large droplet . In general , following a full quench of the system , i . e . , after nucleation and depletion of the dilute phase , the mean droplet radius is expected to evolve as a power law with exponent ùõΩ , such that ‚å©ùëÖ‚å™ ~ ùë° ùõΩ where ùõΩ = 1 3‚ÅÑ . Two distinct processes identically predict this exponent : Lifshitz - Slyozov Wagner ( LSW ) theory describes growth by Ostwald ripening 13 , and Brownian - motion driven coalescence ( BMC ) describes how individual droplets collide and fuse 14 . Droplet growth obeying this 1 / 3 power law has been observed in a variety of biological systems , including lipid membranes 15 , in vitro protein droplets , and nucleoli in C . elegans embryos 16 , but distinguishing between the two mechanisms is not always possible . In addition to the ambiguity in distinguishing these two processes , our understanding of the physics governing condensate coarsening within living cells is further complicated by the strongly viscoelastic nature of the intracellular environment . Indeed , droplet movements and interactions are expected to be strongly impacted by their viscoelastic environment . A particularly striking example of this interplay is found in Xenopus laevis oocytes , whose nuclei contain hundreds of nucleoli , which are strongly constrained by an F - actin scaffold that only relaxes on very long time scales , giving rise to a broad power - law distribution of nucleolar sizes 3 . Upon actin disruption , the nucleoli sediment under gravity and undergo large scale coalescence into a single massive nucleolus 17 . In human cell lines , nucleoli exhibit liquid - like properties of formation and fusion but vary in their shapes and sizes 18 . Interestingly , these size and shape variations are tied to nuclear processes such as transcription and chromatin condensation 19 , suggesting that active processes can influence the properties and distribution of phase separated condensates . Taken together , these findings are consistent with the shapes and sizes of nuclear condensates being strongly influenced by their physical environment . In addition to nucleoli , the nucleus contains dozens of different types of condensates , including Cajal bodies , paraspeckles , PML bodies , and nuclear speckles , each of which is intimately associated with the surrounding chromatin network . Chromatin is the active polymeric material into which DNA and its associated proteins assemble and is packed into the nucleus at dense volume fractions , with measurements ranging from 12 to 52 % 20 . Chromatin can be considered a continuous material on the length scale of microscopically visible droplets : electron microscopy images 20 , as well as experiments utilizing microinjected fluorescent dextrans 21 , both suggest an average chromatin pore size of less than 100 nm 22 , although chromatin exhibits significant heterogeneity on micron length scales 23 . Micromanipulation of extracted nuclei has also revealed that chromatin exhibits its own force response independent of the nuclear lamina , which has been the focus of most nuclear mechanics studies . The mechanical response of chromatin appears to depend on its epigenetic modifications and degree of compaction 24 , although chromatin‚Äôs frequency - dependent viscoelastic response has not been studied in detail . Despite the clear functional importance of understanding the link between the dynamics of phase separation and the surrounding viscoelastic genetic material , very few studies have examined this connection . Most studies to date have relied on simplified in vitro systems using purified components in an aqueous buffer . As a result , the impact of the cellular milieu on phase separation has generally been unexplored , partly due to a lack of tools for interrogating phase separation in living cells 25 . However , recent advances have led to the development of optogenetic approaches , which utilize light to control intracellular phase separation through oligomerization of disordered and substrate binding domains 7 , 22 , 26 , 27 . Experiments using these systems have suggested that nuclear condensates preferentially form in relatively chromatin - poor regions and tend to exclude chromatin as they grow 22 . However , the physics governing the relationship between chromatin‚Äôs material properties , and the formation , mobility , growth , and ultimate size distribution of embedded condensates , remains unclear . Here , we utilize the biomimetic Corelet system 27 to generate model IDR - based condensates and examine their coarsening dynamics and interactions with chromatin in living cells . We demonstrate that coarsening in the nucleus is significantly slower than classical theory predicts , and occurs primarily via coalescence , rather than via Ostwald ripening . Using particle tracking experiments , we show that this slow coarsening results from strongly subdiffusive condensate motion , in quantitative agreement with a theoretical prediction relating the coarsening and diffusive exponents . The growth dynamics of embedded condensates are thus sensitively dependent on the viscoelasticity of the surrounding chromatin , representing a novel emulsion - based readout of the mechanical environment within living cells . Results Optogenetically engineered condensates exhibit slow coarsening dynamics . To study interactions between proteinaceous condensates and chromatin , we utilized the two - component Corelet system 27 ( Fig . 1 ) , to control condensate formation in living cells . Corelets are based on a ferritin core composed of 24 subunits each fused to an iLiD domain , and a phase separation - driving IDR fused to sspB , iLiD‚Äôs optogenetic heterodimerization partner . Here , we used the IDR from the Fused in Sarcoma ( FUS ) protein , a member of the FET family of transcription factors 28 . We expressed these constructs in human osteosarcoma ( U2OS ) cells , which contain nuclei typical of mammalian cells , and yet are experimentally tractable , particularly for microscopy studies . Consistent with previous work 27 , upon blue light activation , iLiD and sspB bind , resulting in oligomerized IDR assemblies that phase separate above a threshold of concentration and valence ( degree of oligomerization ) . These model phase - separated nuclear condensates are visible within seconds of blue light activation , providing a powerful platform for spatially and temporally interrogating the impact of the viscoelastic environment on their dynamic coarsening behavior . We first sought to characterize droplet coarsening in live nuclei , by activating cells and measuring Corelet droplets over the course of 105 minutes . At very early times , coarsening could be convoluted with nucleation and growth , initially driven by the supersaturated dilute phase , with an early - stage growth exponent predicted to be ¬Ω 29 . We found that the dilute - phase intensity rapidly decreased and began stabilizing after roughly 3 minutes of activation ; a slow subsequent linear decrease is likely due to photobleaching ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . We thus wait until after this transient dilute - phase equilibration and then probe the coarsening dynamics by determining the mean radius of droplets over time ( Fig . 1d ) . Averaging over cells , we find a consistent power - law exponent of ùõΩ = 0 . 12 ¬± 0 . 01 ( Fig . 1e ) . This low exponent is surprising , given that both Ostwald ripening and Brownian motion coalescence - dominated coarsening predict ùõΩ = 0 . 33 , which is commonly observed in nonliving systems 15 . Our results are not an artifact of the small size of droplets , as similar results were found by using integrated intensity as a proxy for size ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . Moreover , the observed heterogeneity across cells in initial droplet sizes is accounted for by variation in the expression of protein constituents ; individual fits on a per - cell basis show that scaling behavior follows a similar exponent , with more noise at low volume fraction ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . Droplet coarsening is dominated by coalescence events . To elucidate the mechanism underpinning this anomalously slow growth , we investigated the relevance of two possible scenarios of droplet coarsening , Ostwald ripening ( i . e . LSW ) and Brownian - motion - driven coalescence ( BMC ) ( Fig . 2a , b ) . While both mechanisms are driven by the minimization of surface energy , Ostwald ripening would occur via continuous growth / shrinkage of droplets , while a merger - dominated process would take place via discrete jumps in size associated with collision events . Consequently , we tracked pairs of droplets that merged , finding that their sizes were stable for minutes before merger , at which point the resulting merged droplet attained the size predicted by volume conservation and remained that size for minutes in the absence of further collisions ( Fig . 2c ) . This behavior was consistent over 29 apparent mergers analyzed across 18 cells , based on single bookending frames independently segmented before and after identified in - plane merger events ( Fig . 2d ) , suggesting that growth over the entire bookended time interval ( 648¬±62 seconds on average ) was accounted for by coalescence . These data are consistent with BMC - dominated coarsening , albeit with an anomalously low exponent . However , we reasoned that Ostwald ripening could also play a role , but would manifest relatively infrequently , in shrinkage and growth of unequal - sized droplets . To create a particularly polydisperse distribution , we activated nuclei with a low - intensity spatial gradient of blue light for 30 seconds , resulting in nuclei with droplets accumulated on one side and a local enrichment of protein in the dilute phase on the activated side , consistent with previously observed ‚Äòdiffusive capture‚Äô of core molecules 9 . Switching to uniform blue light stimulation resulted in fast equilibration of the dilute phase ( < 10 seconds , Supplementary Fig . 3 ) and therefore a uniform influx of newly - activated molecules . Within minutes , we observed nucleation and growth of droplets on the previously unactivated side ( Fig . 2e , f ) . We reasoned that if Ostwald ripening played an important role in the growth of our droplets , any small , newly nucleated droplets would quickly vanish since ripening would favor the preexisting ones , which are on the order of 3 - 5 fold larger in radius . However , we observed the opposite , finding that the new droplets grew to a similar size as the preexisting ones . Thus , we conclude that late - stage growth of our droplets is primarily driven by droplet coalescence events . Coarsening exponent is predicted to depend on diffusive exponent . Having empirically concluded that the coarsening of droplets is primarily driven by coalescence , we sought to quantitively explain the anomalously slow coarsening exponent . We therefore revisited scaling arguments from the literature 15 which assume ordinary diffusion of droplets . More generally , the rate at which droplets collide should depend on their mean squared displacement ( MSD ) , i . e . ‚å©ùë• 2 ‚å™ ~ ùê∑ ùëü Œîùë° ùõº where Œ± is the diffusion exponent ( Œ± = 1 for ordinary diffusion , Œ± < 1 for subdiffusive motion , e . g . in a viscoelastic environment ) . At fixed droplet volume fraction ( i . e . , having reached a steady - state dilute - phase concentration ) , the typical spacing ùëô between droplets is related to their typical radius ùëü by ùëô ~ ùëü . Then , assuming that droplets collide over a time scale at which their mean - squared displacement equals their typical spacing , i . e . ‚å©ùë• 2 ‚å™ ~ ùëô 2 , and assuming a diffusion coefficient ùê∑ ùëü ~ ùëü ‚àí1 as in Stokes drag , we find that ùëü ( ùë° ) ~ ùë° ùõº 3‚ÅÑ , i . e . , ùõΩ = ùõº 3‚ÅÑ , confirming our intuition that subdiffusing droplets should coarsen slowly . Note that , in the case of ordinary diffusion ( ùõº = 1 ) , we recover the expected ùõΩ = 1 3 ‚ÅÑ . To examine the validity of this scaling argument , we performed simulations on the coarsening of subdiffusing droplets . We generated 500 droplets of identical initial radius , randomly placed in a 3D continuous space with periodic boundary conditions at a volume fraction of 5 % . Droplets diffused according to fractional Brownian motion ( fBM ) , with a step size inversely proportional to their radius such that ùê∑ ùëü ~ ùëü ‚àí1 . After initial placement and subsequently after each timestep , overlapping droplets were merged with volume conserved and the new droplet placed at their center of mass . Unsurprisingly , the more subdiffusive the motion , the slower the coarsening of the droplet size distribution ( Fig . 3a ) . The average droplet radius over time was calculated for each simulation ( Fig . 3b ) , and the coarsening exponent ùõΩ was obtained by fitting a power law starting at t = 10 2 . We found that ùõΩ ‚âà 0 . 3ùõº , in good agreement with our scaling argument . Droplets exhibit subdiffusive motion due to constraints from surrounding chromatin . Our simulations and scaling argument suggest that the surprisingly small coarsening exponent ùõΩ could arise from subdiffusive droplet dynamics . Since the nucleus contains a dense chromatin network , we reasoned that droplets may indeed exhibit subdiffusive dynamics due to the presence of chromatin . We therefore first examined the physical interactions between the droplets and chromatin . To generate droplets of a size significantly above the diffraction limit we applied a local light activation protocol . We illuminated an approximately 2 - micron diameter circular region for 10 minutes , in cells stained with Hoechst 33342 , a marker of bulk DNA density . Consistent with previous experiments using the related CasDrop system , we observed depletion of the DNA marker from the droplet , suggesting that chromatin is largely excluded from the droplets ( Fig . 4a , b ) . We found that IDRs from several transcriptionally relevant proteins , including those from HNRNPA , TAF15 , and BRD4 , show a similar chromatin - exclusion effect ( Fig . 4c ) . Qualitatively , all these large droplets moved relatively little , over minutes of observation . Likewise , following global activation for well over an hour , smaller droplets remained distributed throughout the nucleus , with their spatial position changing very little ( Fig . 1c ) . We therefore surmised that droplets are constrained by the surrounding chromatin network . To quantitatively test the predicted relationship between the coarsening and diffusive exponents , i . e . ùõΩ = ùõº / 3 , we performed particle tracking on individual droplets to characterize their motion . Droplets were tracked over two timescales , at a rate of 60 ms / frame for 2 minutes and later at a rate of 3 seconds / frame for 100 minutes . The plotted MSDs were calculated by first time averaging within trajectories and then ensemble averaging over all droplets for multiple cells . Over long timescales ( several minutes ) , we found that bulk translation of the nucleus appeared to increase the MSD ; the diffusive exponent was therefore taken from the early times . We find that droplets do , in fact , exhibit subdiffusive motion : from a fit over lag times Œîùë° ranging from 60ms to 12s , we obtain an exponent of approximately ùõº = 0 . 48 ¬± . 08 . This anomalous exponent ùõº was calculated using ensemble - averaged MSDs taken from droplets generated with a global activation protocol and relatively low variation in size . Since ùõº could depend on size , for example if droplet size were comparable to the chromatin mesh size , we sought to examine this aspect further . We applied local activation as described above to generate droplets of greatly varying sizes ( ranging from approximately 200 to 1000 nm in radius ) ( Fig . 6a inset ) . After switching to global activation , the sizes of these droplets were estimated , and they were tracked for 5 minutes at a frequency of 60 ms . Trajectories were binned based upon size and MSDs , were ensemble averaged , and then fit ( Fig . 6a ) . The subdiffusive exponent Œ± was approximately 0 . 5 for all sizes ( Fig . 6b ) , consistent with a chromatin mesh size below the radius of all interrogated droplets , in agreement with previous estimates 22 . This data also allows us to examine the dependence of the anomalous diffusive coefficient on droplet size ( Fig 6c ) . Interestingly , rather than exhibiting the usual Stokes dependence , ùê∑ ùëü ~ ùëü ‚àí1 , the best fit power - law yields ùê∑ ùëü ~ ùëü ‚àí0 . 44¬±0 . 18 with a coefficient of determination of ùëÖ 2 = 0 . 45 , compared to a ùëÖ 2 = ‚àí0 . 26 for a power - law slope of - 1 . Discussion In this study , we sought to understand how the size distribution of intracellular condensates is impacted by their local mechanical environment . We utilized a model system comprised of light - activated condensates , nucleated within the dense viscoelastic chromatin environment in the nucleus of living cells . Consistent with prior results 22 , we found that droplets assembled using intrinsically disordered protein regions ( IDRs ) from transcriptional proteins tend to localize within chromatin - poor regions , and exclude chromatin as they grow . We found that these model condensates remain relatively stable , even over the span of hours , failing to coarsen into a single large domain , which would be expected for a simple phase - separating system . We find that the viscoelastic chromatin network appears to underlie subdiffusive motion of droplets , which hinders droplet coalescence , giving rise to an anomalously small coarsening exponent . The two primary mechanisms for droplet coarsening are droplet coalescence ( BMC ) and Ostwald ripening ( LSW ) , both of which predict a coarsening exponent of ùõΩ = 1 3‚ÅÑ , significantly larger than our measurement of ùõΩ = 0 . 12 ¬± 0 . 01 . We provide evidence that Ostwald ripening does not strongly contribute to the coarsening of droplets . We attribute the lack of Ostwald ripening to a low surface tension , which is expected to be on the order of ùõæ ~ ùëòùëá / ‚Ñì 2 where ‚Ñì is a characteristic molecular length scale 30 , which for macromolecules ( i . e . biomolecules ) is relatively large . Indeed , previous work on nucleolar protein condensates in and out of cells suggest that their surface tension is on the order of 10 - 7 N / m 18 , 31 ; considering parameters for FUS N Corelets 27 , we estimate that Ostwald ripening should drive droplet growth at a rate of ùëëùëÖ ùëëùë° ~ 10 ‚àí9 ¬µm / s for droplets with an initial radius of 300nm . By contrast , we estimate a significantly larger initial growth rate due to subdiffusive merger : based on an average initial droplet spacing of 1 . 3 ¬µm ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) , and our tracking data ( Fig . 5b ) , we obtain an approximate growth rate of 6 √ó 10 ‚àí6 ¬µm / s ( Supplementary Note ) . Calculating the average growth rate from our coarsening data ( Fig . 1d ) , we obtain an average growth rate of 2 . 4 ¬± 0 . 3 √ó 10 ‚àí5 ¬µm / s , within an order of magnitude of this latter , independent estimate . Ostwald ripening is thus minimal , and instead the coarsening dynamics clearly appear to be dominated by droplet coalescence events , which we reasoned may be retarded by chromatin viscoelasticity . Indeed , from scaling arguments , and our simulation of a fractional Brownian walk , the classic ùõΩ = 1 / 3 prediction for BMC can be extended to subdiffusive random walks , yielding ùõΩ = ùõº / 3 , where ùõº is the anomalous diffusion exponent . Consistent with this picture , tracking the motion of our model condensates reveals a high degree of subdiffusive constraint , with ùõº = . 48 . From this measurement , the ùõΩ = ùõº / 3 prediction of ùõΩ ~ 0 . 16 , is relatively close to the measured value of ùõΩ = 0 . 12 . The 30 % deviation between these numbers could reflect additional physics which we do not account for . For example , the dependence of the diffusive prefactor on droplet size may be non - Stokesian . However , our best fit yields ùê∑ ùëü ~ ùëü ‚àí0 . 5 , which invites a correction of the scaling argument to ùõΩ = ùõº / 2 . 5 ( which was confirmed in simulation , Supplementary Fig . 4 ) , increasing the deviation from theory . Instead , we attribute the lower value of the ripening exponent ùõΩ to caging : on very long timescales , we anticipate that the MSD should saturate , due to the presence of boundaries ( e . g . heterochromatic domains ) , further slowing the merger process . This saturation of the MSD may take place on very long timescales which were not captured here due to drift of the nuclei and stage ; it is also possible that drift contributed to a small overestimation of the MSD even after correction by image registration . We also note that we tracked condensates and considered them to be entirely independent , while local compressive stresses could cause droplets to slow down when in the vicinity of one another but still merge rapidly when the cavities they induce in the chromatin meet , explaining correlated motions observed in endogenous organelles immediately preceding merger 19 , 32 . Interestingly , while the strongly viscoelastic nature of the surrounding chromatin thus appears to retard droplet coalescence , it may also underlie our finding that droplet coalescence is dominant compared to Ostwald ripening . Previous work on synthetic ( nonbiological ) systems has demonstrated that Ostwald ripening can be suppressed by elastic constraints , stabilizing small droplets even in the presence of large ones 33 , 34 . Though surface tension drives a preference for the growth of larger droplets , when embedded in a porous elastic matrix , smaller droplets result in smaller deformations and therefore potentially lower energetic costs , dependent on the relative magnitudes of surface tension and matrix elasticity . It has also been shown that the spring constant of chromatin for micron - scale perturbations is ~ 10 ‚àí3 N / m , four orders of magnitude larger than its surface tension , suggesting that elastic forces could further slow Ostwald ripening in the nucleus . The intimate link between droplet coarsening dynamics and chromatin viscoelasticity underscores the potential for utilizing these model condensates as passive microrheological probes . Nucleoli and other endogenous condensates have been proposed as probes in a similar fashion 19 , but their dynamics are confounded by essential biological processes , such as nucleation at specific sites and nonequilibrium activity , and by their multicomponent nature . By contrast , our engineered optogenetic droplets can be assembled from IDRs lacking specific interaction domains , and the resulting probe ( droplet ) size can be controlled using local activation protocols . Within the nucleus , our optogenetic droplets report on the viscoelastic nature of the entangled chromatin matrix . We find strongly subdiffusive dynamics , with ùõº = 0 . 48 and ùê∑ ùëü = ùëü ‚àí0 . 44¬±0 . 18 , roughly consistent with the Rouse polymer model , which predicts ùõº = 0 . 5 and ùê∑ ùëü = ùëü ‚àí0 . 5 . The Rouse model describes the dynamics of a polymer of beads connected by springs and has been used to describe subdiffusion in other biological systems 35 ; we speculate that a droplet immersed in a viscoelastic gel and far above the mesh size should exhibit similar dynamics . Future studies will apply this technique to interrogate the mechanical properties of chromatin under varying perturbations . Our findings also have implications for the assembly of endogenous membraneless organelles . Cajal bodies and nucleoli , associated with relatively chromatin - poor regions , have also been shown to exhibit subdiffusive dynamics , which , moreover , are sensitive to drug treatment , e . g . , ATP depletion and transcriptional inhibition 36 , 37 . Similarly , nuclear speckles display increased mobility as well as increased merger frequency upon transcriptional inhibition and subsequent chromatin condensation . Thus , chromatin condensation and mechanics likely influence the sizes of endogenous membraneless organelles . Future studies will investigate the roles of nonequilibrium biological processes and of specific interactions in the interplay between chromatin mechanics and phase separation .

Methods Cell culture U2OS ( a kind gift from Mark Groudine lab , Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center ) and Lenti - X 293T ( Takara ) cells were cultured in growth medium consisting of Dulbecco‚Äôs modified Eagle‚Äôs medium ( GIBCO ) , 10 % fetal bovine serum ( Atlanta Biologicals ) , and 10 U / mL Penicillin - Streptomycin ( GIBCO ) , and incubated at 37¬∞C and 5 % CO 2 in a humidified incubator . Lentiviral transduction Lentivirus was produced by transfecting the transfer plasmids , pCMV - dR8 . 91 , and pMD2 . G ( 9 : 8 : 1 , mass ratio ) into LentiX cells grown to approximately 80 % confluency in 6 - well plates using FuGENE HD Transfection Reagent ( Promega ) per manufacturer‚Äôs protocol . A total of 3 Œºg plasmid and 9 ŒºL of transfection reagent were delivered into each well . After 60 - 72 hours , supernatant containing viral particles was harvested and filtered with 0 . 45 Œºm filter ( Pall Life Sciences ) . Supernatant was immediately used for transduction or aliquoted and stored at ‚àí80¬∞C . U2OS were seeded at 10 % confluency in 96 - well plates and 20 - 200 ŒºL of filtered viral supernatant was added to the cells . Media containing virus was replaced with fresh growth medium 24 hr post - infection . Infected cells were imaged no earlier than 72 hr after infection . Cell line generation To generate a population of cells stably expressing H2B - miRFP670 , cells were infected in a 6 - well plate , transferred to 60mm plate , and finally sorted with a flow cytometer ( BD Biosciences ) , with gating for single - cells intermediate to high levels of miRFP670 . The sorted cell line was then infected with viral supernatant as described above to express Corelet components . Gradient activation experiments were performed in this cell line so that the entire nucleus was visible at all times . Hoechst Staining Media was removed from 96 well plate and replaced with fresh media containing 1ug / mL Hoechst 33542 ( Thermo ) and incubated for 20 minutes prior to imaging . Cell fixation Cells infected with lentivirus and plated on a 96 well plate as described above were placed on an 96 well plate LED array ( Amuza ) for 15 minutes , after which media was aspirated and 4 % paraformaldehyde ( Electron Microscopy Sciences , diluted in PBS ) was added and the plate remained on the LED array for 15 more minutes . Cells were then imaged and droplets tracked as otherwise described . MSDs were calculated and used to reflect systematic experimental error in the live - cell data . Microscopy All images were taken with a spinning - disk ( Yokogawa CSU - X1 ) confocal microscope with a 100X oil immersion Apo TIRF objective ( NA 1 . 49 ) and an Andor DU - 897 EMCCD camera on a Nikon Eclipse Ti body . A 488nm laser for imaging GFP and global activation , and a 561 was used laser for imaging mCherry . The imaging chamber was maintained at 37¬∞C and 5 % CO 2 ( Okolab ) with a 96 well plate adaptor . Local activation was performed by using a Mightex Polygon digital micromirror device ( DMD ) to pattern blue light ( 488nm ) stimulation from a Lumencor SpectraX light engine . All image acquisition was performed using Nikon Elements Advance Research software . Image Analysis Image Segmentation All images were analyzed in Fiji ( ImageJ 1 . 52p ) 38 and MATLAB 2019b ( Mathworks ) . Individual cells were cropped by hand and saved as . tifs , which were analyzed in MATLAB . Briefly , droplets were segmented in the GFP channel by using Otsu‚Äôs algorithm to identify the nucleus in the first frame ; an intensity threshold was defined as two standard deviations above the mean of the initial nuclear GFP intensity . This threshold was applied to all following frames to identify droplets ; regions 4 pixels and smaller were discarded . Then , r egionprops was used to identify individual domains and calculate their area . Radii were calculated by dividing the area by œÄ and taking the square root . To calculate volume fraction , the dilute phase of the nucleus was identified by applying a threshold at 3 standard deviations above background concentration ( characterized by imaging a sample with no fluorescence ) . In instances where no initial , pre - activation green channel was available ( e . g . , local activation experiments ) , Otsu‚Äôs method ( imbinarize in MATLAB ) was used to determine an intensity threshold for droplets . For gradient activation experiments , Otsu‚Äôs method was used to segment nuclei in the miRFP channel , and again applied to pixels identified as being inside the nuclei to identify droplets on a per - frame basis . All results were validated by manual inspection . Analysis in Figures 1c , 1d , 2c , 2d , and 5 utilized the same raw data . Particle Tracking and Registration To track particles image registration was first performed to correct for rigid body motion using the StackReg plugin in Fiji . Subpixel tracking was then performed in Trackmate 39 using a Laplacian of Gaussians filter - based detector and a blob diameter of 500nm ( or an appropriate size for local activation experiments with large droplets ) , a threshold of 250 . Trajectories were then constructed using the simple LAP tracking with max linking and gap - closing distances of 500nm and no frame gap accepted . Only trajectories spanning the entire movie ( or in the case of the 100 minute movies , at least half the movie ) were accepted . Coordinates were then loaded into MATLAB to calculate MSD and cross - correlations . Simulations Simulations were performed in MATLAB on the Della cluster ( Princeton Research Computing ) . First , 500 droplets of identical radius ( 1AU ) were generated in 3D with periodic boundary conditions . Box size was set based on the volume fraction ( generally set at 5 % ) . Overlapping droplets were then merged . Droplet merger was implemented by randomly selecting a pair of overlapping droplets and replacing them with one new droplet centered at their center of mass . The size of the new droplet was size determined by volume conservation of the original pair . This was iterated until no pairs of overlapping droplets remained . Then , for each droplet , a fractional Brownian motion trajectory with the appropriate ùõº was synthesized ( wfbm ) for the appropriate number of timesteps ( generally set to 10 4 ) . The step size was set such that a droplet of radius 1 AU would diffuse an average of 1AU in 3D per timestep . At each timepoint , each droplet proceeded one step along the synthesized trajectory , scaled by the inverse of the droplet size in the case of ùê∑ ùëü ~ 1 / ùëü . Droplets were merged as previously described .

Figure 1 Fig . 1 : Coarsening dynamics of light - activated protein condensates in living cells . a , In the presence of blue light , the Corelet system recruits IDRs ( red ) to the ferritin cores ( green ) , to drive phase separation in the nucleus of living cells . b , Within seconds of exposure to blue light , droplets nucleate and grow . c , Top images show snapshots of FUS Corelet condensates at indicated times . Main plot shows average droplet radii for 18 cells calculated over 105 minutes and plotted starting 3 minutes after activation . The size distribution for 8 cells with similar supersaturation ( mean supersaturation of 0 . 77 with standard deviation 0 . 08 ) was taken at timepoints of 5 , 45 , and 105 minutes . d , The average radius of droplets per cell ‚å©ùëÖ / ùëÖ 0 ‚å™ was plotted over time , after normalizing by the radius ùëÖ 0 of each droplet at the defined t 0 of 3 minutes , revealing a power law with exponent approximately 0 . 12 ( solid red line ) . Error was propagated as standard error of the mean ( SEM ) . Dashed red lines have slopes of 0 . 15 and 0 . 10 , respectively . Figure 2 Fig . 2 : Droplet growth is dominated by coalescence . a , b , Emulsions generally coarsen by Ostwald ripening or by mergers , respectively characterized by continuous and discrete growth . c , Example ( plot with select corresponding images ) showing condensates are stable over long timescales , remaining the same size for minutes and then coming into contact ( cyan and green points ) , merging , and settling at a stable size consistent with volume conservation ( black line shows predicted conserved volume of final droplet ; uncertainty of prediction is propagated from standard errors of the time - averaged means of the original two droplets ) . d , Volume conservation accounts for size changes over many collisions ( n = 29 ) . e , Gradient activations were used to generate polydisperse droplets . Following 30 seconds of activation with an intensity gradient of blue light , droplets formed primarily on the high intensity side of the nucleus . After switching to global activation , new smaller droplets nucleated and grew on the other side of the nucleus . f , Quantification of the experiment described in e over 10 cells . Droplets were segmented and binned by location along the axis of the nucleus ; droplet size was normalized for each cell and averaged over cells . Error bars are SEM . Figure 3 Fig . 3 : Simulations quantitatively demonstrate the scaling relation between the diffusive exponent and the coarsening exponent . a , 500 droplets were placed in a three dimensional box at a volume fraction of 0 . 05 and allowed to diffuse with a specified subdiffusive exponent ùõº , and merge upon collision . b , Values of Œ± were chosen ranging from 0 . 3 to 1 ; for each of twenty replicates per condition , the average radius of the droplets was calculated , normalized to the average at t = 0 . Shaded region indicates standard error of the mean . c , For each simulation condition , the coarsening exponent was calculated by fitting a power law starting at t = 10 2 and plotted against the input diffusive exponent ùõº . Figure 4 Fig . 4 : Droplets occupy chromatin - poor regions . a , Droplets can be locally ‚Äòwritten‚Äô in specific locations by patterning blue light stimulation . Co - staining with Hoechst 33342 demonstrates that droplets are generally associated with chromatin - sparse regions . b , Radially averaged intensity profiles of the Hoechst and droplet channels demonstrate that the chromatin is depleted within the droplet ( averaged over 5 droplets ) . c , Identical analyses on droplets formed using three other IDRs ( BRD4dN , TAF15 N , HNRNPA C ) reveal similar exclusion of chromatin . Error bars show SEM over 5 , 7 , and 5 droplets respectively . Figure 5 Fig . 5 : Droplets within the nucleus exhibit strongly subdiffusive motion . a , FUS Corelet condensates were tracked at a framerate of 60ms per frame for two minutes ( starting 3 minutes after activation ) . They were then tracked for the following 100 minutes at 3s / frame . Only droplets with continuously visible trajectories were tracked , with a minimum duration of 2 minutes in the short phase and 50 minutes in the long phase . b , Mean squared displacements for the short and long tracking phases are shown in blue and magenta respectively , ensemble averaged over 18 cells . Shaded region indicates standard error of the mean . The magenta MSD follows a similar slope but demonstrates nonlinear increase , likely due to stage and whole - nucleus drift . Noise floor ( black data points ) was estimated to be ~ 30ùëõùëö by applying the same tracking protocol on fixed cells , which exhibited similar long - term increases ; fitting the MSD of the fixed condensates gave an exponent of . 07 which was used as a conservative estimate of the uncertainty for the diffusive exponent . Figure 6 Fig . 6 : Condensates can be used as microrheological probes of the cellular environment . a , Local activation protocols generate size - selectable stable droplets ( inset image ) . After initial stimulation , droplets were imaged for 5 minutes at 60ms / frame and tracked for the entire movie . Trajectories were binned by droplet size and time - and ensembled - averaged to produce an MSD for each size bin . Shaded region indicates standard error of the mean . b , Subdiffusive exponent versus droplet size . Horizontal error bar is standard deviation of droplet sizes in each bin ; vertical error bar is 95 % CI of mean diffusive exponent from power - law fits . c , The effective diffusion coefficient decreases with droplet size . Best fit line ( solid ) is ùê∑ ùëü ~ ùëü - 0 . 44¬±0 . 18 ( standard error of the fit ; ùëÖ 2 = 0 . 45 ) ; a ùê∑ ùëü ~ ùëü ‚àí1 reference line is also shown ( dashed line ; ùëÖ 2 = ‚àí0 . 26 ) . Horizontal error bar is standard deviation of droplet sizes in each bin ; vertical error bar is 95 % CI of effective diffusion coefficient from power - law fits . For this fit , the smallest point ( ÔÉ° ùëÖ ÔÉ± = 0 . 13 ¬± 0 . 3ùúáùëö ; plotted in grey ) was excluded because its standard deviation overlapped with the diffraction limit significantly .
