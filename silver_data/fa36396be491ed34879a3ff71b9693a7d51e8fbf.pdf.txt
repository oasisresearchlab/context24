Collective interactions of multivalent molecules mediated by modular binding domains can induce gelation and phase separation in several cytosolic and membrane - associated systems . The adaptor protein Nck has three SRC - homology 3 ( SH3 ) domains that bind multiple proline - rich segments in the actin regula - tory protein neuronal Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein ( N - WASP ) and an SH2 domain that binds to multiple phosphotyrosine sites in the adhesion protein nephrin , leading to phase separation . Here , we show that the 50 - residue linker between the first two SH3 domains of Nck enhances phase separation of Nck / N - WASP / nephrin assem - blies . Two linear motifs within this element , as well as its overall positively charged character , are important for this effect . The linker increases the driving force for self - assembly of Nck , likely through weak interactions with the second SH3 domain , and this effect ap - pears to promote phase separation . The linker sequence is highly conserved , suggesting that the sequence determinants of the driving forces for phase separation may be generally important to Nck func - tions . Our studies demonstrate that linker regions between modular domains can contribute to the driving forces for self - assembly and phase separation of multivalent proteins . phase separation | multivalency | interdomain linker | adaptor proteins | intrinsically disordered E ukaryotic cells are compartmentalized into different organ - elles , which have specific functions . Membrane - bound or - ganelles , such as the endoplasmic reticulum and vacuoles , have been studied extensively , and their functions are relatively well understood . Non – membrane - bound organelles also exist in cells . These organelles include P - granules , Cajal bodies , promyelocytic leukemia ( PML ) bodies , paraspeckles , and the nucleolus , for example ( 1 ) . Recently , many of these non – membrane - bound structures have been proposed to form via liquid – liquid demix - ing phase transitions of their constituent molecules ( protein , DNA , and RNA ) ( 2 ) . For example , germ - line P - granules and the nucleolus show liquid - like properties , including droplet fusion , fission , and shearing , and they dissolve and condense in a fashion reminiscent of a phase separation process ( 3 – 5 ) . Similarly , stress granules also condense and dissolve , sequestering the family of DYRK kinases ( 6 ) . Organelles , such as the centrosome , have also been studied through the lens of phase separation ( 7 ) . A molecular understanding of the physical properties that pro - mote formation of new phases is important for understanding the nature , function , and regulation of non – membrane - bound organ - elles . We recently showed that multivalent proteins interact with multivalent ligands to form higher order species in aqueous solution that phase - separate and give rise to liquid droplets . The constituent proteins are highly concentrated in these droplets ( ∼ 100 - fold ) ( 8 ) . This phenomenon appears to be general for multivalent proteins ; we have observed it for both natural and engineered systems in - volving both protein – protein and protein – RNA interactions ( 8 ) . When one of the interacting species is tethered to a membrane , multivalent polymerization and phase separation can also result in formation of analogous dynamic puncta on the surface of the membrane ( 9 ) . A recent study demonstrated a similar multivalency - based behavior based on constituents of the mRNA decapping machinery ( 10 ) . In that work , interactions between high - valency helical Leu - like motifs and the oligomeric RNA - binding protein LSm caused the formation of a separate liquid phase . These studies have emphasized the formation of large oligo - mers through the interactions of ordered domains . These domains bind their ligands through well - defined molecular interfaces , with affinities in the range of 1 – 100 μ M through specific interactions to form discrete complexes . The connection of the domains by flex - ible tethers has been regarded largely as a mechanism to achieve multivalency and promote dynamics in the ligand - induced 3D networks . In other studies , however , disordered regions of proteins , particularly those regions composed of low - complexity amino acid sequences , have been found to promote phase separation in vitro and in cells ( 11 – 15 ) and to promote association with RNA granules ( 11 , 12 , 16 , 17 ) . These disordered elements can self - associate , leading to liquid droplets ( 15 ) or hydrogels ( 11 , 12 ) , with the former being apparently isotropic and latter being enriched in amyloid - like fibers . These studies highlight the importance of disordered regions in the molecular self - assembly leading to formation of phase - separated structures in cells . The adaptor protein Nck and its orthologs function in sig - naling pathways that control diverse cellular processes , including axon guidance , cell movement , cell – cell fusion , stress responses , and maintenance of cell – cell adhesions ( 18 – 23 ) . In many cases , these responses are coupled to the polymerization of actin through Significance Many eukaryotic proteins are composed of tandem arrays of modular domains , which bind peptide ligands that also often appear in tandem arrays . The interdomain linkers in such systems are often considered merely passive elements that flexibly con - nect the functional domains . Collective interactions among mul - tivalent molecules lead to micron - sized phase - separated states that are thought to be important in cellular organization . Here , we show that in the multivalent signaling adaptor protein Nck , weak interactions involving an interdomain linker play a signifi - cant role in self - assembly and phase separation with ligands neuronal Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein ( N - WASP ) and phosphorylated nephrin . Our results suggest that interactions mediated by ordered modular domains may generally act synergistically with weak interactions of disordered inter - domain linkers to promote phase separation .

Nck is composed of an SRC homology 2 ( SH2 ) domain and three SRC - homology 3 ( SH3 ) domains ; the former binds phosphotyrosine ( pTyr ) in pYDEV sequence motifs , and the latter bind a variety of proline - rich motifs ( PRMs ) ( 14 , 30 , 31 ) . These modules are connected by linkers ranging from 24 to 50 residues that are predicted based on amino acid sequence to be intrinsically disordered ( 32 , 33 ) . NMR analysis of Nck2 has shown that the linkers are mostly disordered , although a portion of the linker between the first and second SH3 domains inter - acts weakly with the latter domain ( 32 ) . We have demonstrated that Nck phase - separates upon interaction with PRMs in its ligand , N - WASP , and that this process occurs at lower concen - trations in the presence of the pTyr - containing ligand , phosphor - ylated nephrin ( p - nephrin ) ( 8 , 9 ) . Phase separation is dependent upon the number of pTyr motifs in p - nephrin and SH3 domains in Nck . Other than the NMR study cited above , the possible functions of linkers in Nck have , to the best of our knowledge , not been systematically examined . The linkers are often viewed as passive , flexible tethers between the SH2 and SH3 domains . In this study , we demonstrate that the linker between the first and second SH3 domains of Nck can affect the phase separation behavior of p - nephrin / Nck / N - WASP oligomers . The linker consists of a basic N - terminal element and an acidic C - terminal element . The basic element promotes phase separation of Nck assemblies through two short linear motifs , as well as its overall positively charged character . This effect correlates with increased self - assembly of Nck , which NMR analyses and computer simulations suggest may be mediated by weak interactions of the linear motifs with the second SH3 domain . Taken together with analysis of the linker - mediated phase behavior , our data suggest that weak in - teractions of the linker act synergistically with higher affinity interactions of the modular domains ( SH3 - PRM and SH2 - pTyr ) to promote collective interactions among the constituent mole - cules that give rise to phase separation . Given that the sequence compositions and lengths of the linkers in different adaptor proteins are highly variable , these disordered regions may help specify when and where phase separation occurs in biological multivalent systems . Results Linker Between the First and Second SH3 Domains Can Promote Phase Separation of Nck Constructs . The three SH3 domains of Nck share 27 – 30 % pairwise amino acid sequence identity to each other . Previous studies have suggested that the different domains have different binding specificities for PRMs ( 31 , 34 – 36 ) . To elimi - nate these differences and isolate valency as the examined pa - rameter , our recent investigation of p - nephrin / Nck / N - WASP on supported bilayers used engineered Nck - like proteins containing tandem repeats of the second Nck SH3 domain . This work dem - onstrated that phase separation is dependent on both the number of SH3 domains in Nck and the number of pTyr sites in p - nephrin , supporting the idea that phase separation is driven by collective interactions of multivalent species ( 9 ) ( Fig . 1 A ) . Here , we began by asking if differences between the three SH3 domains in natural Nck might add complexity to this simple model . To test for specific roles of the different SH3 domains , we engineered a series of Nck truncation mutants containing only two SH3 domains ( plus the SH2 domain ) and examined their ability to phase - separate in the presence of N - WASP ( plus 7 . 5 μ M triple p - nephrin in all phase separation experiments hereafter , except where explicitly noted ) . We term the SH3 domains of Nck S1 , S2 , and S3 , from N - terminal to C - terminal . We term the linkers between these domains L1 and L2 , respectively , and we term the linker between S3 and the SH2 domain L3 ( Fig . 1 B ) . We varied the concentration of an N - WASP fragment con - taining the basic , proline - rich , and VCA ( verprolin homology , central and acidic ) regions of the protein ( named simply N - WASP hereafter ) and the various Nck proteins . Varying full - length Nck and N - WASP in concert ( i . e . , moving along the diagonal of the phase diagram ) , phase separation is observed at 5 μ M of both proteins ( 8 ) ( Fig . 2 A and SI Appendix , Fig . S1 ; note that in the complete phase diagram , phase separation is observed with as little as 5 μ M Nck and 1 μ M N - WASP ) . With the divalent molecules S1 - L1 - S2 - L3 - SH2 and S1 - L1 - S3 - L3 - SH2 , phase separation is observed at a concentration of 20 μ M plus 20 μ M N - WASP ( Fig . 2 B and C ) . The increase in the concentration required for phase separation with loss of S3 or S2 , re - spectively , is consistent with the valency dependence observed previously with the engineered Nck - like proteins ( 9 ) . Further , the data suggest that S2 and S3 make similar contributions to phase separation , because exchanging them produces identical behavior . However , to our surprise , the divalent molecule S2 - L2 - S3 - L3 - SH2 does not phase - separate even up to a concentration of 250 μ M plus 250 μ M N - WASP ( Fig . 2 D ) . Thus , the three di - valent molecules are not equivalent in their ability to drive phase separation . To examine whether different binding specificities of the SH3 domains could account for these observations , we measured the affinities of each domain for a panel of PRM peptides derived from N - WASP by NMR spectroscopy . We analyzed 12 peptides consisting of individual PRMs , as well as three peptides consisting of two PRMs ( Table 1 ) . In each case , we titrated unlabeled pep - tide into 15 N - labeled SH3 domain and fit the 1 H and 15 N chemical shifts of the domain , measured in 1 H / 15 N heteronuclear single quantum coherence ( HSQC ) spectra , to a single - affinity binding isotherm . The dissociation constants ( K d s ) for the binding of S1 to the individual PRMs ranged from 255 to 1 , 080 μ M , with some values too weak to measure ( K d > 1 , 080 μ M ) ; the diPRM con - structs had apparent K d values greater than or equal to 720 μ M , suggesting negative cooperativity compared with some of the in - dividual PRM peptides ( Table 1 ) . S2 had dissociation constants ≥ 150 μ M against the single PRMs and ≥ 64 μ M for the diPRMs ( Table 1 ) . S3 had behavior similar to S2 , with K d values against individual PRMs ≥ 220 μ M and against diPRMs ≥ 67 μ M . In general , S2 and S3 had similar patterns of affinities for the various peptides and typically bound with higher affinity than did S1 . The similar affinity patterns of S2 and S3 toward the PRMs are also consistent with the identical phase separation behaviors of Bar 50 m p - Nephrin Nck N - WASP p p p p p p p p p L1 - S2 - L2 - S3 - L3 - SH2 S2 - L2 - S3 - L3 - SH2 L1 - S2 - L2 - S3 - L3 - SH2 S1 - L1 - S2 - L3 - SH2 Nck S1 L1 S2 S3 L2 L3 SH2 L1 - S2 - L2 - S3 - L3 - SH2 L1basic - S2 - L2 - S3 - L3 - SH2 S1 - L1 - S3 - L3 - SH2 L1chargeshuffle - S2 - L2 - S3 - L3 - SH2 L1c30shuffle - S2 - L2 - S3 - L3 - SH2 DR L1D / R - S2 - L2 - S3 - L3 - SH2 L1addcharge - S2 - L2 - S3 - L3 - SH2 L1 - S2 - L2 - S3 - L3 - SH2 A B Fig . 1 .

( B ) Some constructs based on Nck used in this study . Banjade et al .

However , the binding affinities appear insufficient to explain the absence of phase sep - aration by S2 - L2 - S3 - L3 - SH2 , because S2 and S3 bind better than S1 to virtually every peptide , and thus should promote oligo - merization more strongly . Another difference between constructs that phase - separate and constructs that do not was the presence and absence of L1 , which was previously shown to bind to S2 in an autoinhibitory fashion ( 32 ) ( Fig . 2 ) . Therefore , we added the L1 motif to the inactive divalent construct to produce L1 - S2 - L2 - S3 - L3 - SH2 . This construct phase separated at a concentration of 30 μ M plus 30 μ M N - WASP ( Figs . 3 A and B ) . Thus , L1 was able to impart the ability to phase - separate to an apparently inactive di - SH3 protein . An L1 - only peptide does not phase - separate at concentrations as high as 2 mM , suggesting that the effect of the linker is syner - gistic with multivalent interactions of the SH3 domains of Nck with the PRMs of N - WASP . Positively Charged Element in L1 Promotes Phase Separation . The sequence of L1 shows a striking distribution of charges , with a highly basic N terminus and a highly acidic C terminus ( Fig . 3 A ) . All but one of its 10 basic residues lie within its N - terminal half , and all but one of its six acidic residues lie within its C - terminal half . This distribution is conserved across evolution from fish to humans , and also in Nck2 . To understand how L1 promotes phase separation , we initially examined several L1 - S2 - L2 - S3 - L3 - SH2 constructs lacking dif - ferent portions of the linker . A construct lacking the first 17 residues of the N - terminal basic region ( Δ L1 - S2 - L2 - S3 - L3 - SH2 ) did not phase - separate up to 250 μ M concentration plus 250 μ M N - WASP ( Fig . 3 C ) . Mutation of three Lys residues in this region to Glu ( L1K / E - S2 - L2 - S3 - L3 - SH2 ) or deletion of the central KVKRK motif ( L1 Δ KVKRK - S2 - L2 - S3 - L3 - SH2 ) , which was previously shown to interact with S2 ( 32 ) , had similarly deleterious effects on phase separation ( Fig . 3 D and E , respectively ) . However , replacing the C - terminal 25 amino acids with an uncharged ( GGSA ) 3 linker did not affect phase separation , producing liquid droplets at a concen - tration of 30 μ M plus 30 μ M N - WASP ( L1 Δ CT - S2 - L2 - S3 - L3 - SH2 ; Fig . 3 F ) . Thus , in the context of the di - SH3 proteins , two regions of L1 appear to be most important for promoting phase separation : the 17 N - terminal residues and the central KVKRK motif . In systems composed of disordered regions with linear binding motifs , the amino acid sequence contexts of those motifs ( i . e . , the flanking regions ) can influence their interactions with ligands . Because basic elements within the N terminus are important for phase separation , we asked whether the degree of positive charge in L1 could affect phase separation ( SI Appendix , Fig . S2 A ) . Increasing the overall positive charge in L1 ( L1basic ; SI Appendix , Fig . S2 B ) or increasing the positive charge density in the N - terminal element ( L1addcharge and L1D / R ) enhances the driving force for phase separation such that phase separation is observed at concentrations of 10 or 20 μ M di - SH3 protein plus 10 or 20 μ M N - WASP ( SI Appendix , Fig . S2 C and D , re - spectively ) . In contrast , shuffling charged residues throughout L1 ( L1charge - shuffle ) or all residues in the C - terminal 30 amino acids ( L1c30shuffle ) leads to impairment of phase separation ( SI Ap - pendix , Fig . S2 E and F , respectively ) . It is noteworthy that both sets of mutations also perturb the central KVKRK motif . The combined mutagenesis data suggest a model in which two regions , the N - terminal 17 residues and the KVKRK motif , as well as the overall positive charge / positive charge density in the sequence , are responsible for the promotion of phase separation by L1 . We also observed similar effects of L1 perturbations in full - length Nck . In experiments performed in the presence of 7 . 5 μ M Table 1 .

S3 B ) . A construct where L1 is replaced with a ( Gly - Gly - Ser - Ala ) 10 linker [ Nck ( L1ggsa ) ] requires a concentration of 40 μ M plus 40 μ M N - WASP to phase - separate ( SI Appendix , Fig . S3 C ) . Deletion of 15 residues from the N terminus of L1 ( Nck Δ L1b ) shifts the phase separation boundary to a concentration of 20 μ M plus 20 μ M N - WASP ( SI Appendix , Fig . S3 D ) , as does shuffling the entire L1 sequence ( Nck L1shuffle ; SI Appendix , Fig . S3 E ) . Therefore , the enhancement of phase separation by L1 occurs consistently across a wide range of di - SH3 and full - length Nck proteins , and appears to depend on the degree and density of positive charge in the se - quence . We note that because Nck has higher SH3 valency than the di - SH3 proteins , polymer theory predicts that its propensity to oligomerize ( and thus phase - separate ) should be less affected by the added valency provided by L1 interactions , consistent with our data ( 37 ) . A summary of the constructs examined here and their phase separation behaviors is presented in SI Appendix , Fig . S4 . L1 Promotes Self - Assembly of Nck . We focus the remainder of our analysis on the mechanism by which L1 promotes phase separation . We used isothermal titration calorimetry to compare the affinity of L1 - S2 - L2 - S3 - L3 - SH2 and L1chargeshuffle - S2 - L2 - S3 - L3 - SH2 for N - WASP . Although this experiment is complicated by the presence of multiple SH3 domains and multiple PRMs in the respective partners , a simple 1 : 1 model of the binding isotherms yielded essentially identical apparent K d values of 54 μ M and 58 μ M for L1 - S2 - L2 - S3 - L3 - SH2 and L1chargeshuffle - S2 - L2 - S3 - L3 - SH2 , respectively ( Fig . 4 A ) . These affinities are not higher than the af - finities of the individual SH3 domains for the di - PRM peptides ( Table 1 ) . Together , the calorimetry and NMR data suggest that L1 does not substantially increase the affinity of the di - SH3 proteins for N - WASP . L1 did not substantially decrease the af - finity either , as might be expected based on the work of Takeuchi et al . ( 32 ) , likely because of the very low affinity of the L1 – S2 interaction ( discussed below ) . Thus , the difference in phase separation behavior of these constructs is probably not due to differential ability to bind N - WASP . Further , as shown in SI Appendix , Fig . S5 A and B , the ability of L1 to promote phase separation does not require p - nephrin , suggesting that the effect is not due to increased affinity of the Nck SH2 domain for pTyr A B C D E F Fig . 3 .

Thus , L1 does not appear to act by enhancing modular SH3 - PRM or SH2 - pTyr interactions . We next asked whether L1 might promote self - association of Nck . We used dynamic light scattering ( DLS ) to measure the diffusion coefficients of the di - SH3 proteins as a function of concentration ( Fig . 4 B ) . The construct containing L1 ( L1 - S2 - L2 - S2 - L3 - SH2 ) showed decreasing diffusion coefficients as the concentration increased from 1 to 25 mg / mL ( 27 . 6 to 690 . 9 μ M ) . Over this same concentration range , the construct lacking L1 ( S2 - L2 - S2 - L3 - SH2 ) showed a smaller decrease . These data in - dicate that the Nck constructs can weakly self - associate , and that L1 enhances this effect . As described below , NMR data support a similar conclusion ( Fig . 5 ) . To assess self - association mediated by electrostatic interac - tions involving L1 further , we examined the salt dependence of the DLS data . We measured the diffusion coefficients of diSH3 proteins containing either WT L1 or L1chargeshuffle in buffer containing 150 – 750 mM KCl ( SI Appendix , Fig . S5 C ) . At lower KCl concentrations ( 150 mM and 250 mM ) , the L1 - S2 - L2 - S3 - L3 - SH2 protein shows lower diffusion coefficients than the L1charge - shuffle - S2 - L2 - S3 - L3 - SH2 protein , suggesting greater self - asso - ciation in the WT L1 protein . The diffusion coefficient of the WT construct increases significantly as salt concentration is raised , consistent with disruption of intermolecular electrostatic in - teractions . At KCl concentrations higher than 500 mM , the diffu - sion coefficient of the WT construct equals the diffusion coefficient of the charge - shuffled mutant , which is less sensitive to salt than the WT . The combined data suggest that L1 has a propensity to en - hance Nck self - association due to electrostatic interactions . These interactions are weakened either by the screening in high salt or by the screening that is encoded by shuffling the charge , thus weak - ening the linear charge density . We note that the concentrations used in the DLS experiments are appreciably higher than the concentrations required for phase separation , indicating that the enhancement of association due to L1 is very weak . Nevertheless , when acting in concert with multivalent SH3 – PRM interactions , such weak effects are evidently significant . We previously showed that dimerization or , more generally , oligomerization of N - WASP increases activity toward the Arp2 / 3 complex , due to the presence of two binding sites for the N - WASP VCA region on the Arp2 / 3 complex ( 38 , 39 ) . We asked if the weak self - association of L1 in the presence of multivalent SH3 – PRM interactions could also increase the activity of N - WASP in Arp2 / 3 - mediated pyrene - actin assembly assays ( 40 ) ( Fig . 4 C ) . In such assays , the fluorescence of pyrene - labeled actin increases upon incorporation of the protein into filaments such that changes 0 500 1000 1500 2000 3 4 5 6 7 50 nM Arp2 / 3 + 50 nM N - WASP + 5 µM L1 - S2 - L2 - S3 - L3 - SH2 + 50 nM N - WASP + 5 µM S2 - L2 - S3 - L3 - SH2 + 50 nM N - WASP Time ( sec ) F l uo r e sc en c e ( A .

Ad - dition of 5 μ M S2 - L2 - S3 - L3 - SH2 to assays containing 50 nM N - WASP , 50 nM Arp2 / 3 complex , and 2 μ M actin ( 5 % pyrene - labeled ) had no effect on the kinetics of actin assembly . However , addition of 5 μ M L1 - S2 - L2 - S3 - L3 - SH2 decreased the lag time and increased the rate of assembly , indicating higher N - WASP activity ( Fig . 4 C ) . These experiments were performed without nephrin , in conditions where phase separation does not occur . Furthermore , the construct we use does not include the GTPase binding domain ( GBD ) region of N - WASP ; therefore , the increase in activity to - ward the Arp2 / 3 complex is not due to regulation of autoinhibition of N - WASP ( 41 ) . These data are consistent with the idea that L1 enhances the self - association of Nck / N - WASP complexes . Overall , the correlation between stronger self - association and the promotion of phase separation among the di - SH3 constructs examined here ( S2 - L2 - S3 - L3 - SH2 ∼ L1chargeshuffle - S2 - L2 - S3 - L3 - SH2 < L1 - S2 - L2 - S3 - L3 - SH2 ) suggests that these properties are related . Thus , weak self - association of Nck through positively charged elements in L1 could act cooperatively with stronger SH3 – PRM and SH2 – pTyr interactions to promote phase sepa - ration in the p - nephrin / Nck / N - WASP system . The effect of enhancement in phase separation by L1 also occurs , although to a lesser degree , in an independent system of multivalent proteins . A protein consisting of five small ubiquitin - like modifier ( SUMO ) domains fused to five SUMO interac - tion motifs ( SIMs ) through a ( GGS ) 4 linker ( SUMO 5 - SIM 5 ; SI Appendix , Fig . S5 D ) phase - separates at 12 μ M . However , a pro - tein in which SUMO 5 and SIM 5 are connected by L1 ( SUMO 5 - L1 - SIM 5 ) phase - separates at 4 μ M . A protein in which L1 is replaced with L1chargeshuffle phase separates at 10 μ M , quite similar to the construct containing a ( GGS ) 4 linker ( SUMO 5 - L1chargeshuffle - SIM 5 ; SI Appendix , Fig . S5 D ) . Thus , the effects of L1 are not entirely specific to the p - nephrin / Nck / N - WASP system . Rather , the linker can act autonomously to promote the phase separation of multivalent proteins . This observation suggests that the charged blocks of residues can interact nonspecifically with charges on the surfaces of other protein partners , but when the acidic and basic residues are shuffled to decrease the local charge density , these interactions are diminished . In this regard , it is probably important that like S2 and S3 of Nck , both SUMO 5 and SIM 5 are acidic ( pI = 5 . 34 and 4 . 07 , respectively ) and that SUMO structures show a prominent acidic surface patch , which could enable favorable interactions with the basic element of L1 . In the context of multivalent binding , these weak interactions could pro - duce an enhancement in assembly of these complexes . L1 Can Interact with the Second SH3 Domain of Nck . To learn how L1 might promote self - assembly of Nck , we examined 1 H / 15 N transverse relaxation - optimized spectroscopy ( TROSY ) spectra of several 15 N - labeled Nck proteins . The spectrum of L1 - S2 - L2 - S3 - L3 - SH2 shows a large number of well - dispersed resonances , indicative of folded domains , as well as a series of intense , poorly dispersed resonances , representing disordered , dynamic residues ( Fig . 5 A and SI Appendix , Fig . S6 A ) . Deletion of L1 , which elimi - nates 48 backbone amides of the protein , causes the disappearance of 36 resonances , all of which are in the poorly dispersed region ( 1 H chemical shifts between 7 . 8 and 8 . 7 ppm ) .

Intensities were normalized to the intensities at 50 μ M . Banjade et al . PNAS | Published online November 9 , 2015 | E6431 B I O C H E M I S T RY P N A S P L U S lost suggests that 12 residues in L1 are undergoing chemical exchange , and thus have highly broadened / missing resonances in the L1 - S2 - L2 - S3 - L3 - SH2 spectrum . In addition to eliminating many cross - peaks , loss of L1 causes shifts in 18 backbone cross - peaks of lower intensity , 15 of which are in the well - dispersed regions of the spectrum ( 1 H chemical shifts < 7 . 8 ppm and > 8 . 7 ppm ) ( SI Appendix , Fig . S6 A ) . Three Trp side - chain cross - peaks shift as well ( Fig . 5 B ) . Overlaying the spectrum of isolated S2 reveals that all of these shifting cross - peaks correspond to this domain ( Fig . 5 B and SI Appendix , Fig . S6 A ) . Thus , our data suggest that as in Nck2 , L1 of Nck contacts S2 . To understand this interaction better , we further analyzed the spectra of L1 - S2 and S2 constructs , which could be assigned with greater completeness and certainty than the spectra of the longer proteins . Consistent with data on the longer proteins , resonances from L1 in the L1 - S2 protein show poor chemical shift dispersion . Furthermore , peaks corresponding to the C - terminal acidic por - tion of L1 have high and relatively uniform intensity , whereas peaks in the N terminus are appreciably weaker ( SI Appendix , Fig . S6 B ) . Five of the N - terminal 11 residues could not be assigned due to exchange broadening ; the first Lys residue of the KVKRK motif also could not be assigned . Notably , these regions correspond well to the elements of L1 that promote phase separation ( Fig . 3 ) . As in the longer proteins , loss of L1 also causes substantial changes in chemical shift to 18 backbone amide resonances in S2 ( SI Appendix , Fig . S7 A ) and all three Trp indole cross - peaks . Mapping these crosspeaks to the S2 structure shows that they localize to one face of the domain ( SI Appendix , Fig . S7 B ) , with highest density near one end of the canonical PRM binding site ( SI Appendix , Fig . S7 B , denoted by a circle ) . Notably , the highly acidic Arg – Thr loop ( RT loop ) is located near the center of the affected region , and all five of its residues are perturbed ( E120 - R121 - E122 - D123 - E124 ; SI Appendix , Figs . S6 and S7 ) . This site overlaps with the L1 binding site in Nck2 previously identified by Takeuchi et al . ( 32 ) . Interestingly , comparing 1 H / 15 N HSQC spectra of S3 and an engineered L1 – S3 fusion showed chemical shift changes of many residues belonging to S3 upon deletion of L1 ( SI Appendix , Fig . S8 A ) , suggesting that L1 can also make cis - interactions with S3 when fused directly to it . This effect likely explains the ability of the S1 - L1 - S3 - L2 - SH2 construct to phase - separate ( Fig . 2 C ) . We note that S2 and S3 are both acidic ( pI = 4 . 6 ) , suggesting that the basic nature of L1 could allow it to interact with acidic ordered domains in proximity . We also used atomistic simulations based on the ABSINTH implicit solvation model and force - field paradigm ( 42 ) to obtain atomic - level insights regarding the pattern and likelihoods of contacts that might form between L1 and S2 . The construct for these simulations was Ac - L1 - S2 - Nme , where Ac and Nme , re - spectively , refer to N - acetyl and N ′ - methylamide capping groups . For the simulations , we used the recently developed Hamiltonian switch - metropolis Monte Carlo ( HS - MMC ) methodology that is designed to enhance conformational sampling of disordered re - gions tethered to ordered domains ( 43 ) . The details of the sim - ulation methodology and the analysis are presented in SI Appendix . The main results are summarized in SI Appendix , Figs . S9 and S10 . SI Appendix , Fig . S9 A shows the ensemble - averaged interresidue distances we compute within L1 and between L1 and S2 . We performed 10 independent HS - MMC runs , and the patterns of contacts are consistent across all 10 runs . SI Appendix , Figs . S9 B and S10 provide quantitative summaries of the probabilities as - sociated with observing persistent interresidue contacts between the L1 and S2 domains . The results point to a pattern of inter - domain distances that is suggestive of spatial proximity between residues within the N - terminal half of L1 and the acidic surface of S2 , specifically the RT loop and residues in its spatial neigh - borhood . The simulation results are in accord with the NMR ex - periments and suggest that spatially proximal contacts between the N - terminal half of L1 and the S2 domain ( smallest distances ≤ 3 . 5 Å ) are observed in 2 – 5 % of the conformations sampled . In addition , the simulated ensembles show a consistent pattern of intermediate - range distances being sampled between the residues of the N - terminal half of L1 and the acidic surface of S2 . A rep - resentative conformation demonstrating the types of interdomain contacts that can form is shown in SI Appendix , Fig . S9 C . Finally , we also examined intermolecular binding of L1 to S2 . First , we recorded 1 H / 15 N HSQC spectra of S2 in the presence of various concentrations of an isolated L1 protein ( SI Appendix , Fig . S8 B and C ) . Addition of L1 causes progressive changes in many resonances of S2 . The pattern of affected resonances is very similar to the pattern observed in comparing the S2 and L1 - S2 spectra , indicating that the interaction occurs in similar fashion in trans and in cis ( SI Appendix , Fig . S7 A and B ) . Fitting the chemical shift changes in trans to a single - site binding isotherm yields a K d value of ∼ 1 . 3 mM , similar to the K d value previously measured by Takeuchi et al . ( 32 ) for Nck2 ( ∼ 1 . 7 mM ) . We further examined intermolecular binding of L1 by measuring the intensity of peaks in 1 H / 15 N HSQC spectra of S2 and L1 - S2 as a function of concentration between 50 μ M and 2 , 000 μ M ( Fig . 5 C ) . As expected for a noninteracting system , intensities of S2 peaks scale nearly linearly with concentration . In contrast , peak intensities for L1 - S2 are highly nonlinear with concentration due to line - broad - ening . Together , these data suggest that at higher concentrations , binding of L1 to S2 in trans can cause self - assembly of the protein through interactions analogous to those interactions occurring in cis at lower concentrations . The simplest explanation for our NMR and simulation data are that in L1 - S2 - L2 - S3 - L3 - SH2 ( and , by inference , full - length Nck itself ) , residues within the N - terminal half of L1 that include the KVKRK motif make low - likelihood contacts with the surface of the S2 in a region that is spatially proximal to the acidic RT loop , in or near the PRM binding site . At low concentrations , these interactions are predominantly in cis . However , they can also oc - cur in trans at high concentrations . In the context of p - nephrin / Nck / N - WASP assemblies , where multiple Nck proteins are held in close proximity , the weak interactions likely promote Nck self - assembly and , consequently , phase separation . We recognize that if L1 interacts with the PRM binding site , this interaction could increase the apparent valency of Nck ( by enabling multiple mol - ecules to come together ) , but at the expense of total free SH3 concentration in solution . Nevertheless , the interaction of L1 in trans would increase the sizes of the complexes formed , decreasing their solubility ( 37 ) and therefore promoting phase separation . Discussion Phase separation of biological molecules into distinct liquid - like structures may be a general approach used by cells to form and regulate non – membrane - bound compartments . We previously demonstrated that phase transitions can result from collective interchain interactions between multivalent proteins and their multivalent ligands ( 8 ) . The collective effects of multiple specific interactions between modular elements ( with K d s in the 1 – 100 μ M range for the binding of pairs of modules ) can lead to increased local concentration of complementary modules and the formation of a system - spanning network ( i . e . , a sol - gel transition ) . Our ob - servations are in accord with theories that have been developed to describe the phase behavior of linear chains that have multiple complementary binding modules and are also characterized by weak , nonspecific self - associations ( 44 ) . According to these theo - ries , multivalent polymers with complementary binding modules can undergo phase transitions through a combination of demixing driven by weak nonspecific self - associations and a sol - gel transition that is realized through collective interactions among networks of binding modules . Linkers between binding modules are necessary for generating multivalent proteins with complementary binding modules . These E6432 | www . pnas . org / cgi / doi / 10 . 1073 / pnas . 1508778112 Banjade et al . linkers need not just be passive generators of multivalency . They can also serve as scaffolds for linear interaction motifs . Addition - ally , they can drive self - associations or compete for complementary interactions with ordered domains . We used the behavior of Nck and its ligands p - nephrin and N - WASP to examine the interplay between modular domain interactions and the properties of interdomain linkers . We have found that the linker between the first and second SH3 domains of Nck can promote phase separa - tion of multivalent assemblies with N - WASP and p - nephrin . This effect is seen for both di - SH3 and tri - SH3 Nck constructs , and in complexes with N - WASP alone and those complexes containing all three proteins . This property of the linker results from three se - quence features , namely , the N - terminal 17 residues , the central KVKRK motif , and the basic character of the N - terminal half of the sequence . For several constructs , the enhancement of phase separation correlates with an increased ability to promote weak Nck self - association , but not with higher affinity Nck / N - WASP or Nck / p - nephrin binding . Thus , increased self - association of Nck may be the mechanism by which the linker promotes phase separation of Nck / N - WASP and p - nephrin / Nck / N - WASP complexes . NMR analyses and atomistic simulations provide a potential “ structural ” mechanism for self - association , by revealing weak specific in - teractions of L1 to the second SH3 domain of Nck . The corre - spondence of the sequence motifs in L1 that bind the SH3 domain ( SI Appendix , Fig . S6 ) with those sequence motifs that promote phase separation ( Fig . 3 and SI Appendix , Figs . S2 – S4 ) , as well as the acidic character of the interaction site on the SH3 domain ( SI Appendix , Fig . S7 C ) and the importance of the overall basic char - acter of L1 in promoting phase separation ( SI Appendix , Fig . S2 ) , support the idea that L1 – SH3 interactions provide the mechanism for L1 to promote phase separation . At high concentrations , this interaction can also occur in trans , which enables self - binding . We note that L1 also enhances phase separation in the S1 - L1 - S3 - SH2 and polySUMO - polySIM systems , which obviously lack the second Nck SH3 domain . Nevertheless , both proteins are characterized by acidic surfaces ( S3 , SUMO , and SIM ) . We found that L1 can bind to S3 ( SI Appendix , Fig . 8 A ) , and we speculate that the acidic re - gions of SUMO and / or SIM could similarly bind weakly to the basic element of L1 , leading to self - assembly and phase separation . ClustalW analysis of ∼ 50 Nck sequences reveals that the protein is highly conserved from fish to mammals , with average pairwise identity to human Nck1 of ∼ 95 % across the entire sequence . The average pairwise identity in the linker ( 94 . 9 % ; Fig . 6 ) is comparable to the average pairwise identity in the three SH3 domains ( 95 . 1 % , 95 . 7 % , and 94 . 8 % , respectively ) and the SH2 domain ( 97 . 3 % ) , and slightly higher than the average pairwise identity in L2 and L3 ( 89 . 5 % and 86 . 3 % , respectively ) . The strong conservation of the linkers is unusual for multidomain proteins , suggesting that the properties of these elements in Nck are functionally important , perhaps through a general role of self - assembly and phase sepa - ration in Nck pathways . In this regard , it is notable that a large number of reported Nck ligands have three or more predicted or demonstrated pTyr binding sites for the Nck SH2 domain ( 45 , 46 ) , which would enable them to promote polymerization and phase separation analogous to p - nephrin . Proteomic analysis has shown that several Ser and Thr residues in the basic region of L1 can be phosphorylated in cells ( 47 , 48 ) . The importance of the basic N - terminal region in the behavior of L1 suggests that these phosphorylation events could be used to regulate the phase separation of Nck assemblies , because the phosphoryla - tion of the N - terminal residues would likely be inhibitory toward self - association of Nck . To our knowledge , Nck phosphorylation has not yet been examined in the context of localization / assembly or biological function of the protein . Such analyses will be needed to test these potential regulatory mechanisms in the future . In addition to promoting phase separation of Nck constructs , we observed that L1 can enhance actin assembly through the Arp2 / 3 complex . We previously demonstrated that the affinity of N - WASP for the Arp2 / 3 complex is increased ∼ 100 - fold by di - merization . This effect suggests that the activity of assemblies containing autoinhibited N - WASP should increase with their size , due to the increased probability of containing two active conformers ( 38 ) . Our actin assembly data here are consistent with low - level oligomerization of N - WASP ( below the phase separation concentration ) through the linker – SH3 interaction . We previously demonstrated that phase - separated droplets have much higher activity in Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin assembly assays ( 8 ) . This activity likely arises because the droplets contain large polymers of N - WASP . We hypothesize that in cells , low - level association of N - WASP would have modest effects on activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex , whereas phase separation would act in a switch - like fashion to enhance activity greatly . Our investigations here have all used an N - WASP construct that lacks the GBD of the protein . In native N - WASP , the GBD binds a helix from the VCA element in an intramolecular fashion , blocking interactions of the latter with the Arp2 / 3 complex . This autoinhibition can be relieved by the Cdc42 GTPase , which destabilizes the GBD , releasing the VCA ( 49 , 50 ) . The accompanying paper by Okrut et al . Fig . 6 . L1 is highly conserved . Sequence alignment of the L1 region in Nck1 generated by ESPript ( 58 ) . Conserved charged residues are colored blue for basic residues and red for acidic residues . Banjade et al . PNAS | Published online November 9 , 2015 | E6433 B I O C H E M I S T RY P N A S P L U S ( 51 ) reports that the L1 region of Nck can also bind the GBD of N - WASP , leading to activation toward the Arp2 / 3 complex . In this context , the N - terminal basic region of L1 forms a helix that appears to displace the VCA by structural mimicry . Interestingly , the EspFu protein from the pathogen enterohaemorrhagic Escher - ichia coli ( EHEC ) which hijacks the N - WASP / Arp2 / 3 pathway during infection , uses an identical mechanism to drive N - WASP activation ( 52 ) . The L1 – GBD interaction would provide an addi - tional mechanism of cross - linking in Nck / N - WASP assemblies . In native systems , this interaction likely acts together with the L1 – S2 interaction that we have described here to promote oligomerization ( and potentially phase separation ) of these molecules . The relative contributions of the two L1 binding modes could be regulated by Cdc42 , whose binding should block the L1 – GBD interaction by destabilizing the GBD . The consequences of such switching of L1 interactions on oligomerization , phase separation , and signaling to the Arp2 / 3 complex remain to be explored . Even a cursory analysis of the interdomain linkers of different adaptor proteins demonstrates wide variability in lengths and sequence compositions . Our findings here suggest that adaptors containing linkers with blocks of charges may be more prone to phase separation than those adaptors with more evenly distributed charges . Interactions between opposite charges could occur between linkers and ordered domains , between two different linkers , or even between charged surfaces of ordered elements . The nature of the linkers is expected to influence the propensity to phase - separate , along with features such as module - module binding affinity , avidity effects , and module valency ( 8 ) , and could provide additional mechanisms of regulation . Fine - tuning of these properties likely specifies which multivalent molecules are capable of forming supramolecular polymers and phase - separating in vivo . Biophysical and computational studies , based on these ideas , may be helpful in identifying molecules and pathways that could function and be regulated through phase separation .

Nephrin was expressed with an N - terminal maltose binding protein tag and a TEV protease site , as well as a C - terminal His6 tag preceded by a Prescission protease site , and was affinity - purified using nickel - nitrilotriacetic acid ( Ni - NTA ) agarose beads ( Qiagen ) ; the tags were cleaved using TEV and Prescission proteases , and the nephrin was then applied through ion exchange and size - exclusion purification methods .

Phase Separation Assays . Corning 384 - well plates ( catalog no . 3712 ) were washed with Milli - Q ( Millipore ) water and then with ethanol , and they were then dried under argon . Plates were then incubated with 0 . 1 % BSA in 150 KMEI buffer [ 150 KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 10 mM imidazole ( pH 7 ) , and 1 mM DTT ] for 10 min , and the BSA was washed twice with 100 μ L of 150 KMEI buffer .

Actin assembly experiments were performed as de - scribed earlier ( 40 ) using a high - throughput multiwell plate fluorimeter from Varioskan . The experiments were performed in 150 KMEI buffer . The con - centrations of Arp2 / 3 complex and actin used were 50 nM and 2 μ M , re - spectively . Fifty nanomolar N - WASP ( B - P - VCA regions ) was used in the presence of 5 μ M L1 - S2 - L2 - S3 - L3 - SH2 or S2 - L2 - S3 - L3 - SH2 . Isothermal Titration Calorimetry . Proteins were dialyzed in the same buffer [ 150KMEIand1mMTris ( 2 - carboxyethyl ) phosphine ( TCEP ) inthesamevessel ] before using them for isothermal calorimetry measurements . Measurements were performed at 15 °C on an iTC200 instrument from GE Healthcare . Isotherms were analyzed using the software NITPIC ( 53 ) , and fits were per - formed using the software SEDPHAT ( 54 ) . NMR Spectroscopy . 1 H / 15 N HSQC or 1 H / 15 N TROSY experiments were per - formed with 15 N - labeled L1 , L1 - S2 - L2 - S3 - L3 - S3 , S2 - L2 - S3 - L3 - S3 , and S2 proteins on Varian 500 ( 600 - MHz or 800 - MHz ) spectrometers at 25 °C . In the K d measurements , the initial concentration of the SH3 domains was 100 μ M . PRM peptides were titrated from concentrated aqueous stock solutions into the SH3 domains . Spectra were processed using NMRPipe ( 55 ) and NMRView ( 56 ) . Dissociation constants were derived from fits to single - site binding isotherms . Peaks that appear in the 1 H / 15 N HSQC spectrum of L1 - S2 - L2 - S3 - L3 - SH2 but not in the 1 H / 15 N HSQC spectrum of S2 - L2 - S3 - L3 - SH2 were assumed to be in L1 and were assigned using HNCaCb , CbCa ( CO ) NNH , and CCC - TOCSY - NNH experiments ( 57 ) .
