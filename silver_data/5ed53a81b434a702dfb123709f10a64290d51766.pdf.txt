However , the 25 efficiency of PE varies widely and depends not only on the genomic region targeted , but also 26 on the genetic background of the edited cell . To determine which cellular factors affect PE 27 efficiency , we carried out a focused genetic screen targeting 32 DNA repair factors , spanning 28 all reported repair pathways . We show that , depending on cell line and type of edit , ablation 29 of mismatch repair ( MMR ) affords a 2 - 17 fold increase in PE efficiency , across several human 30 cell lines , types of edits and genomic loci . The accumulation of the key MMR factors MLH1 31 and MSH2 at PE sites argues for direct involvement of MMR in PE control . Our results shed 32 new light on the mechanism of PE and suggest how its efficiency might be optimised . 33 34 35 36 2 Introduction 37 CRISPR - Cas9 - based genome editing technologies are powerful new tools of functional 38 genomics , with considerable potential as future therapeutics ( Jinek et al . , 2012 ) . However , the 39 efficiency of currently available genome editing protocols is limited . Moreover , the process 40 gives rise to undesirable side products that hinder the implementation of this technology in 41 clinical settings . To overcome these hurdles , there is need to identify the DNA metabolic 42 pathways and molecular mechanisms that govern editing outcomes , as well as the activities 43 of these pathways in different cellular and tissue contexts ( Richardson et al . , 2018 ; Yeh et al . , 44 2019 ; Ferreira da Silva et al . , 2021 ; Hussmann et al . , 2021 ) . The first generation of Cas9 - 45 based genome engineering tools used nucleases that could be directed to any desired region 46 of the genome by a single - guide RNA ( sgRNA ) . Following the targeting of a site - specific DNA 47 double - strand break ( DSB ) , the endogenous DNA end - joining pathways frequently repair this 48 lesion in an error prone manner , leading to insertions or deletions ( indels ) that give rise to loss - 49 of - function alleles ( Bothmer et al . , 2017 ) . This approach was further adapted to include either 50 a single - or double - stranded donor template containing the desired edit . Here , the DSB is 51 processed by homology - directed repair ( HDR ) , which catalyses the insertion of the donor 52 template that includes the edit . Unlike the former approach , which generates random indels , 53 the latter method permits the introduction of desired indels , as well as point mutations , into the 54 genome ( Yeh et al . , 2019 ) . However , since HDR is inefficient , depends on potentially 55 deleterious DSBs and requires cell division , alternative approaches were needed . 56 57 Amongst such alternative approaches are Base Editing ( BE ) and Prime Editing ( PE ) . The 58 former uses nucleobase modification chemistry to efficiently and precisely incorporate single 59 nucleotide variants into the genome of cells ( Komor et al . , 2016 ; Gaudelli et al . , 2017 ; Gu et 60 al . , 2021 ) , but its scope is limited to single - base substitutions . This led to the development of 61 PE as a highly versatile genome editing approach that allows for the targeted insertion of 62 indels , point mutations and combinations thereof into the genome ( Anzalone et al . , 2019 ) . PE 63 utilises a fusion of a Cas9 ( H840A ) nickase ( Jinek et al . , 2012 ) and reverse transcriptase ( RT ) 64 that is targeted to a precise genomic region by a PE guide RNA ( pegRNA ) . The pegRNA 65 includes the desired sequence change , as well as a short 3’ terminal extension complementary 66 to the 5’ sequence upstream from the nick within the target site . Annealing of the 3’ terminus 67 of the pegRNA to the 3’ segment of the nicked DNA strand generates a substrate for the RT , 68 which copies the RNA template and thus incorporates the desired edit into the 3’ extension of 69 the nick . Dissociation of the RNA and annealing of the DNA strands generates a 3’ flap 70 containing the edit . Transient melting and reannealing of the nicked target site give rise to a 71 mixture of molecules containing either 3’ or 5’ flaps . Successful installation of the desired edit 72 requires removal of the 5’ flap and ligation of the resulting nick to yield a DNA heteroduplex 73 3 containing the edit in the RT - synthesised strand . The editing outcome of this method , referred 74 to as PE2 , depends on the resolution of this heteroduplex . Utilising an additional sgRNA that 75 directs nicking to the original DNA strand , either concurrently to the edit installation ( PE3 ) , or 76 subsequently ( PE3b ) , increases PE efficiency ( Anzalone et al . , 2019 ) . The increased 77 efficiency in PE3 strategies has been suggested to require the DNA repair pathway known as 78 DNA Mismatch Repair ( MMR ) that would function in the repair of the nicked , non - edited 79 strand , by utilising the edited strand as template ( Petri et al . , 2021 ; Scholefield and Harrison , 80 2021 ) . 81 82 Due to its versatility , PE has been used in a wide variety of models , such as zebrafish ( Petri 83 et al . , 2021 ) , rice and wheat ( Lin et al . , 2020 ) , mouse ( Liu et al . , 2020 ) and human stem 84 cells ( Sürün et al . , 2020 ) . A notable feature of PE is its highly variable rates across different 85 genetic backgrounds , even within the same genomic locus and using the same 86 pegRNA ( Anzalone et al . , 2019 ) . To address whether this could be explained by different DNA 87 repair capacities , we performed a targeted genetic screen aimed at identifying DNA repair 88 factors involved in PE . Here , we uncover an inhibitory role for MMR pathway in PE and show 89 that MMR proteins localise to sites of PE to directly counteract edit installation , rather than 90 promote it . Thus , deletion or transient depletion of MMR factors increase PE efficiency and 91 fidelity across different edit sites , types and cell lines . 92 Results 93 A targeted genetic screen identifies the DNA repair pathway mismatch repair as 94 inhibitory for prime editing 95 To investigate the DNA repair requirements for PE , we conducted a targeted genetic screen , 96 utilising a collection of isogenic knockouts in the human near - haploid HAP1 cell line 97 ( Supplementary Data 1 ) . The 32 targeted genes were selected to represent divergent 98 functions within all known human DNA repair pathways . The library thus provided a 99 comprehensive coverage of the DNA damage response . The cell lines received the PE 100 machinery , including the Cas9 ( H840A ) - RT and a pegRNA encoding a 5 - base pair ( bp ) 101 deletion in the HEK3 locus . PE efficiency was determined by amplicon sequencing of the 102 genomic locus . 103 Wild - type HAP1 cells were remarkably inefficient at PE ( < 1 % alleles edited ) . In contrast , 104 isogenic HAP1 cell lines mutated at the MLH1 , PMS2 , MSH2 , EXO1 and MSH3 loci displayed 105 higher PE levels , ranging from 2 to 6 . 8 - fold ( Figure 1A ) . Disruption of other DNA repair 106 pathways had little or no impact on PE efficiency . This finding clearly indicates that MMR 107 4 functions to inhibit PE . Of all MMR genes targeted in the screen , only the loss of MSH6 failed 108 to increase PE efficiency . 109 The MMR pathway evolved to correct base / base mispairs and small indels arising in DNA 110 during replication and recombination . To initiate repair , these lesions are recognised by the 111 heterodimers MutSα ( MSH2 - MSH6 ) or MutSβ ( MSH2 - MSH3 ) . Whereas MutSα recognises 112 base / base mismatches and indels of 1 - 2 nucleotides , larger indels are recognised by MutSβ 113 ( Drummond et al . , 1995 ; Palombo et al . , 1995 , 1996 ; Acharya et al . , 1996 ; Gradia et al . , 1997 ) . 114 Substrate binding brings about an ATP - dependent conformational change of the MutS 115 complexes and recruitment of the MutLα ( MLH1 - PMS2 ) ( Li and Modrich , 1995 ) or MutL 116 β ( MLH1 - MLH3 ) ( Lipkin et al . , 2000 ) heterodimers . Assembly of the MutL complex together 117 with RFC and PCNA ( Pluciennik et al . , 2010 ) , bound at a pre - existing strand discontinuity 118 ( either a nick or a free 3’ terminus ) , activates cryptic endonucleases of the PMS2 or MLH3 119 proteins , which then introduce additional DNA single - strand breaks ( SSBs ) into the 120 discontinuous DNA strand , in the vicinity of the mismatch . These SSBs act as entry points for 121 EXO1 , which degrades the discontinuous strand in a 5’ to 3’ direction up to , and some distance 122 past , the misincorporated nucleotide ( s ) ( Kadyrov et al . , 2006 ) . The resulting gap is filled - in by 123 DNA polymerase δ and the remaining nick is ligated by DNA ligase I ( Stojic et al . , 2004 ; Iyer 124 et al . , 2006 ; Fishel , 2015 ) . Since the edit introduced in our screen is a 5 bp deletion , this makes 125 it a substrate of MutSβ , but not MutSα ( Palombo et al . , 1996 ) , which explains the lack of an 126 effect on editing upon the loss of MSH6 ( Figure 1A ) . This result highlights the highly 127 specialised nature of the DNA damage response that functions on different substrates . 128 5 129 Figure 1 : Mismatch repair inhibits prime editing in human cells .

We used the colorectal cancer 164 line HCT116 , which is mutated in both MSH3 and MLH1 , alongside the MMR - proficient 165 HCT116 cell line complemented with chromosomes 5 and 3 that house the wild - type copies 166 of the two genes , respectively ( Supplementary Figure 1A ) ( Koi et al . , 1994 ; Haugen et al . , 167 7 2008 ) . The endometrial adenocarcinoma cell line HEC59 , which is mutated at 168 the MSH2 locus , was used together with its MMR - proficient counterpart complemented with 169 chromosome 2 that carries the wild - type MSH2 gene ( Supplementary Figure 1B ) ( Umar et 170 al . , 1997 ) . Additionally , we used a doxycycline - inducible model of MLH1 deficiency in the 171 embryonic kidney cell line HEK293T ( 293T - Lα ) ( Supplementary Figure 1C ) ( Cejka et al . , 172 2003 ) . Finally , we generated an isogenic pair of MLH1 wild - type and knockout HEK293 cells 173 ( Supplementary Figure 1D ) . 174 175 We controlled for the transfection efficiencies of all the matched MMR - deficient and proficient 176 cell line pairs and showed that these were comparable , as measured by the percentage of 177 cells transfected with a GFP expressing plasmid ( Supplementary Figure 1E ) . We then 178 performed PE2 editing by deleting 5 bp within the HEK3 locus . All cell lines showed 179 significantly increased PE2 editing ( ranging from 1 . 7 to 6 . 6 - fold ) when MMR was ablated , 180 compared to their MMR - proficient counterparts ( Figure 1B ) . Importantly , even though PE 181 efficiencies were increased by MMR deficiency , this did not come at the expense of higher 182 indel frequencies within the amplicon region ( Figure 1C ) . Indeed , we observed that loss of 183 MMR prevented unwanted indels at the HEK3 locus in the HEC59 , 293T - Lα and HEK293 cell 184 lines ( Figure 1C ) . 185 To further investigate the substrates of MMR in PE , we measured the editing efficiencies of a 186 transition ( G > A ) , two transversions ( C > G and C > T ) , a 1 bp insertion and a 3 bp deletion , all 187 within a different endogenous locus , the RNF2 locus . We found that active MMR significantly 188 diminished the efficiency of all these edits , ranging from 1 . 6 to 14 - fold , using HEK293 cells 189 that lack MLH1 , a factor that is part of both the MutLα and MutLβ heterodimers , which together 190 repair base / base mismatches , indels of 1 - 2 nucleotides and larger indels ( Figure 1D ) . These 191 findings were also corroborated in the MLH1 / MSH3 - deficient HCT116 cell line 192 ( Supplementary Figure 1F ) . To test the inhibitory role of MMR on different PE strategies , we 193 measured the efficiency of PE2 , PE3 and PE3b on the FANCF locus , via the installation of 194 either an A > C or a G > T substitution in HEK293 and HCT116 cells . Editing efficiency was 195 improved by MMR deficiency for all types of PE ( 1 . 8 - 16 - fold ) , albeit to a lesser extent for PE3 196 ( Figure 1E , Supplementary Figure 1G ) . Overall , these results show that MMR counteracts 197 PE efficiency across different edits and different genomic loci , in various human cell lines . 198 Since both HCT116 and HEC59 are cancer - derived cell lines that display MMR deficiency , it 199 is possible that the higher levels of PE efficiency are due to cellular adaptation . The human 200 retinal pigmental cell line RPE1 is a non - cancer derived cell line , thus we utilised this for 201 corroborating our findings . PE efficiencies are generally very low in RPE1 wild - type cells 202 8 ( Supplementary Figure 1H ) . To overcome this shortcoming , we developed a lentivirus 203 system for stable delivery of the PE3 system , where RPE1 cells constitutively 204 express Cas9 ( H840A ) - RT ( denoted RPE1 PE2 - BSD ) . We generated a CRISPR genetic 205 knockout for the MLH1 factor in this cell line ( Supplementary Figure 1I ) and performed PE3 , 206 by transducing both the pegRNA and the nicking sgRNA installing a 5 bp deletion within the 207 HEK3 locus . We observed an editing efficiency of approximately 35 % in WT RPE1 that was 208 further increased to 60 % in RPE1 - MLH1 - / - ( Figure 1F ) . We additionally extended our findings 209 to human induced - pluripotent stem cells ( hiPSCs ) , engineered to be deficient for either MLH1 210 or MSH2 ( Zou et al . , 2021 ) ( Supplementary Figure 1J ) . Wild - type hiPSCs demonstrated 211 20 % editing efficiency of a 5 bp deletion in the HEK3 locus , while the MLH1 and MSH2 212 deficient counterparts displayed an increased efficiency of approximately 55 % and 40 % , 213 respectively ( Figure 1G ) . Overall , these results confirm that the MMR pathway specifically 214 plays a role in counteracting PE . 215 Mismatch repair factors are recruited to sites of prime editing 216 To confirm that the MMR proteins are directly involved in the processing of PE intermediates , 217 we determined if they are recruited to sites of ongoing editing marked by Cas9 ( H840A ) - RT . 218 Cas9 ( H840A ) - RT was directed to human repetitive telomeric regions , a strategy that has 219 proven efficient for imaging Cas9 ( Chen et al . , 2013 ) ( Figure 2A ) . Using this experimental 220 approach , we were able to colocalize TRF1 ( an essential component of the telomeric shelterin 221 complex ) with catalytically inactive Cas9 ( dCas9 ) , as previously described ( Wang et al . , 2008 ) 222 and also with Cas9 ( H840A ) - RT ( Supplementary Figure 2A - B ) . Therefore , this setup allows 223 for the visualisation of genomic loci undergoing PE , in a pegRNA - dependent manner . Next , 224 we used this system in U2OS cells to express Green Fluorescent Protein ( GFP ) , or GFP - 225 tagged MMR proteins , as well as two additional DNA repair proteins that do not function in 226 MMR ( DDB2 that functions in nucleotide excision repair and 53BP1 that promotes non - 227 homologous end - joining ) . We observed that 65 % of MLH1 - GFP foci and 25 % of MSH2 - GFP 228 foci colocalised with Cas9 ( H840A ) - RT foci ( Figure 2B - C ) . Importantly , we did not observe 229 colocalisation of either DDB2 - GFP or 53BP1 - GFP foci and Cas9 ( H840A ) - RT foci ( Figure 2B - 230 C ) . Furthermore , by using an antibody against MLH1 ( Supplementary Figure 2C - D ) we 231 confirmed the localisation of endogenous MLH1 to sites of PE ( Figure 2D - E ) . We found that 232 30 % of MLH1 foci colocalised with Cas9 , while we did not observe colocalisation when a 233 dCas9 , or a sgRNA , were used ( Figure 2D - E ) . These findings reveal that intermediates of PE 234 are substrates of MMR and we propose that MMR functions to degrade the invading 235 heterologous strand and thus restore the original DNA sequence . 236 9 237 238 10 Figure 2 : The mismatch repair protein MLH1 localises to sites of active prime editing . 239 A ) Scheme of the setup used for imaging .

All scale bars , 5 μm . 251 252 Reversible mismatch repair depletion can be exploited to increase prime editing 253 efficiency 254 We next sought to transiently deplete MLH1 as a strategy to improve PE efficiency . Since loss 255 of MMR leads to increased mutational burden and genome instability ( Jiricny , 2006 ) , long - 256 term inhibition of MMR is not desirable . Thus , to achieve transient MMR ablation , we depleted 257 MLH1 in HEK293 cells with a pool of siRNAs ( Supplementary Figure 3A ) , and subsequently 258 showed that this effectively increased PE efficiency by approximately 2 - fold through the 259 generation of a 5 bp deletion in the HEK3 locus ( Figure 3A ) . 260 An alternative approach for achieving transient loss - of - function is through targeted protein 261 degradation . The degradation tag ( dTAG ) system has proved to be an efficient strategy for 262 rapid and transient ligand - induced targeted protein degradation ( Nabet et al . , 2018 ) . Using 263 CRISPR - mediated knock - in , we introduced the dTAG into the MLH1 locus of HAP1 cells , 264 which allowed for the targeted degradation of MLH1 after treatment with the dTAG ligand . 265 Importantly , the protein levels of MLH1 were restored to those found in wild - type cells after 24 266 hours of removal of the ligand ( Figure 3B ) . Using a flow cytometry - based readout , in which 267 the pegRNA encodes a 1 bp substitution that converts the Blue - Fluorescent Protein ( BFP ) to 268 GFP , we observed a 3 - fold increase in BFP to GFP conversion upon treatment of the cells 269 with the dTAG ligand and subsequent endogenous degradation of MLH1 ( Figure 3C ) . PE 270 efficiency at the HEK3 locus through a 5 bp deletion , as measured by sequencing genomic 271 DNA , was also significantly increased by 3 - fold upon treatment with the dTAG - ligand 272 11 ( Supplementary Figure 3B ) . Importantly , this effect could be rescued to wild - type levels by 273 removing the dTAG - ligand from the medium , thus restoring MLH1 levels ( Figure 3B - C ) . Taken 274 together , these results indicate that transient ablation of MMR represents a promising strategy 275 that can be used to increase PE efficiency . 276 277 Figure 3 : Reversible ablation of MLH1 can be exploited to increase prime editing 278 efficiency A ) PE efficiency of a 5 bp deletion in the HEK3 locus in HEK293 cells transfected 279 12 with non - targeting control ( NTC ) or MLH1 siRNA pools , two days prior to PE vector delivery . 280 Values correspond to editing efficiency , measured by Sanger sequencing and analysed by 281 TIDE ( Brinkman et al . , 2014 ) , in three independent biological replicates , with two technical 282 replicates each .

After 289 the cleavage of the non - edited 5’ - flap by the flap endonuclease ( FEN1 ) , a nick is installed in 290 the edited strand ( D ) . This nick is recognised as a mismatch by the MutS complex , after which 291 MutL is recruited and catalyses incisions that flank the mismatch ( E ) . Exonuclease 1 ( EXO1 ) 292 degrades the incised DNA and Replication protein A ( RPA ) coats the single - stranded DNA 293 ( ssDNA ) ( F ) . Polymerase ! fills the gap and Ligase 1 ( LIG1 ) ligates the nick ( G ) . This repair 294 culminates in an unedited DNA molecule ( H ) . If the nick is ligated before mismatch recognition , 295 an heteroduplex DNA is generated , containing the edit in one of the strands ( I ) . The resolution 296 of this heteroduplex potentially relies on replication ( J ) . In PE3 , the non - edited strand is 297 simultaneously nicked ( L ) , which directs MMR to repair the mismatch depending on which 298 strand is ligated first ( M ) . However , it is possible that the nicking of the non - edited strand is 299 inefficient , leading to the MMR - mediated removal of the edit ( O ) . In MMR - deficient 300 backgrounds , there is ligation of the heteroduplex without removal of the edit ( P , Q ) . Statistical 301 analysis using unpaired t tests . Error bars reflect mean and SEM .

Our results provide clear evidence to the contrary , namely that the MMR 310 system functions on the PE intermediate by degrading the invading , RT - synthesised strand 311 to restore the original sequence . This outcome conforms to our understanding of the molecular 312 mechanism of MMR as gleaned from in vitro systems that made use of circular heteroduplex 313 substrates and extracts of human cells ( Holmes et al . , 1990 ; Thomas et al . , 1991 ) . On these 314 13 substrates , activation of MMR was strictly dependent on the presence of two factors : a 315 mismatch and a pre - existing nick in one strand that was less than 1 kb distant . The repair 316 process was then directed to the nicked strand . Following the extrapolation of these insights 317 into a cellular setting , MMR , activated by misincorporated nucleotides during replication , would 318 be initiated either by the mismatch / indel and either end of an Okazaki fragment in the lagging 319 strand , or the 3’ - end of the primer of the leading strand . During recombination of homologous 320 but non - identical fragments , MMR would be initiated by the heterology ( mismatch or indel ) 321 between the invading donor and the recipient DNA strands , with the 3’ - terminus of the invading 322 strand acting as the signal required to activate the MutL endonucleases . 323 324 We speculate that PE2 resembles the latter mechanism , whereby the RT - synthesised 3’ flap 325 would displace the 5’ terminus of the Cas9 ( H840A ) - RT - generated nick . This would give rise 326 to a 5’ flap , which could be cleaved off by one of several structure - specific endonucleases 327 ( SLX1 , FAN1 , DNA2 ) and finally trimmed by flap endonuclease 1 ( FEN1 ) ( Figure 3D ) . Binding 328 of MutS at the mismatch and its interaction with MutL and RFC / PCNA bound at the 3’ - terminus 329 ( not shown ) would activate the MutL nickase to generate additional incisions flanking the edit 330 ( Figure 3E ) . Exonuclease 1 ( EXO1 ) would then degrade the discontinuous strand to generate 331 a long single - stranded gap bound by Replication Protein A ( RPA ) ( Figure 3F ) . Finally , 332 polymerase δ ( POL δ ) would fill the gap and Ligase 1 ( LIG1 ) ligate the nick ( Figure 3G ) . This 333 process would result in the removal of the edit ( Figure 3H ) . Ligation of the nick ( Figure 3D ) 334 prior to MMR activation ( Figure 3I ) would generate an heteroduplex with one edited and one 335 non - edited strand ( Figure 3I ) , which would be refractory to MMR , and would persist until 336 replication , which would give rise to 50 % progeny carrying the edit and 50 % non - edited 337 ( Figure 3J ) . The path in Figure 3 D - I - J would be favoured in the absence of MMR , thus 338 accounting for the increased yield of edited alleles in MMR - deficient backgrounds . 339 340 Importantly , our data confirm the results of biochemical characterisations of the substrate 341 specificities of MutSα and MutSβ ( Drummond et al . , 1995 ; Palombo et al . , 1995 , 1996 ; 342 Acharya et al . , 1996 ; Gradia et al . , 1997 ) , which showed that the former recognises 343 preferentially base / base mismatches and indels of 1 - 2 nucleotides , whereas the latter binds 344 to larger indels ( Figure 3K ) . Based on these findings , deletion of MSH6 should have failed to 345 affect the outcome of PE using a 5 bp deletion , which was indeed the case , as we report here 346 ( Figure 1A ) . 347 348 Besides types of edits , different PE strategies are likely to be impacted by MMR activity to 349 different degrees . PE3 was developed as a more efficient PE strategy , in which both edited 350 and non - edited DNA strands are nicked ( Figure 3L ) . When nicks are present in both strands , 351 14 the nick nearer the mismatch will be preferentially deployed by the MMR system , but the 352 excision will destabilize the duplex and may lead to a DNA DSB , which explains the increased 353 presence of indels in the final outcome of PE3 ( Anzalone et al . , 2019 ) . If one strand of the 354 heteroduplex is ligated first , MMR is directed to the nicked strand . Therefore , ligation of the 355 edited strand directs MMR to repair the non - edited strand leading to editing on both strands 356 of the DNA heteroduplex , whereas ligation of the non - edited strand results in an unedited DNA 357 molecule ( Figure 3M ) . These outcomes rely on the assumption that the nicking sgRNA acts 358 as efficiently as the pegRNA . This might not always be the case as some DNA molecules 359 might have been edited and nicked by the pegRNA only ( Figure 3N ) . This would lead to the 360 same outcome as PE2 , which is removal of the edit by MMR ( Figure 3O ) . In PE3 , as well as 361 PE2 , cells that lack functional MMR ligate the heteroduplex DNA without removal of the edit 362 ( Figure 3P - Q ) . Thus , we propose that MMR activity counteracts PE3 efficiency , as well as 363 PE2 , albeit to a lesser extent . This difference is due to the loss of a clear discrimination signal 364 of which strand to repair , created by the nick . In PE3b , the nicking of the non - edited strand is 365 designed to happen only after the integration of the edit . Hence , we propose that the MMR 366 dependency of PE3b is the same as PE2 . 367 368 It remains to be seen what the size limitation of PE - generated indels is , that are addressed by 369 MMR . While our work was under revision , two other studies described the suppression of PE 370 efficiency by MMR activity and extensively characterised the types of edits that are efficiently 371 repaired by this pathway . Chen and colleagues showed that MMR involvement decreases with 372 increasing indel size and that G / C to C / G edits , which form C : C mismatches , are less 373 frequently removed by MMR factors ( Chen et al . , 2021 ) . Koeppel and colleagues 374 systematically measured the insertion efficiency of indels ranging from 1 - 69 bp in length 375 ( Koeppel et al . , 2021 ) . The authors observed an overall increase of insertion efficiency upon 376 MMR depletion , with the greatest difference seen for indels 1 - 4 bp long . These results agree 377 with the known substrate specificities of MutSα and MutSβ ( Drummond et al . , 1995 ; Palombo 378 et al . , 1995 , 1996 ; Acharya et al . , 1996 ; Gradia et al . , 1997 ) . Given that one of the most 379 promising applications of PE includes insertion , deletion or replacement of large sequences 380 of DNA , for example to tag endogenous loci within the genome ( Anzalone et al . , 2019 ; Ioannidi 381 et al . , 2021 ) , how these lesions are processed and how their insertion efficiency can be 382 augmented , remains of substantial future interest . 383 384 Our findings suggest that the improvement in PE efficiencies in the absence of MMR does not 385 come at the cost of generation of undesirable indels around the edit site ( Figure 1C ) . However , 386 MMR deficiency brings about a mutator phenotype , which will severely limit the utility of PE 387 protocols that make use of long - term MMR inactivation . This deleterious outcome might be 388 15 substantially reduced by interfering with MMR transiently . Our results suggest that targeting 389 MMR factors with siRNA or protein degradation technologies , such as proteolysis targeting 390 chimeras ( PROTAC ) , represent promising approaches to improve PE efficiencies . Another 391 exciting approach would be to interfere with MMR solely at the edit site , similarly to what had 392 been described for improving the efficiency of HDR ( Charpentier et al . , 2018 ; Rees et al . , 393 2019 ) . While our article was under revision , two new PE strategies were described , PE4 and 394 PE5 , that rely on co - expressing dominant negative MLH1 fragments with the PE2 and PE3 395 machineries , respectively ( Chen et al . , 2021 ) . The authors also reported that pegRNAs 396 encoding contiguous silent or benign mutations around the intended edit function to evade 397 recognition and repair by MMR ( Chen et al . , 2021 ) . This strategy has the potential to improve 398 PE efficiency without the increase in mutational burden that is associated with long - term MMR 399 loss . 400 401 Together with recent reports ( Chen et al . , 2021 ; Koeppel et al . , 2021 ) , our data shed new light 402 on the molecular mechanism of a new and highly promising genome editing technology . We 403 have shown that the MMR pathway inhibits PE efficiency by physically localising to edit sites 404 and promoting their reversion to non - edited sequences . However , the variability in PE 405 observed across cell lines cannot be explained solely by the involvement of MMR and other 406 factors such as cell cycle stage ( Wang et al . , 2021 ) or cellular metabolism might also be 407 contributing factors . Hence , further studies are warranted to identify alternative cellular 408 determinants that might limit or promote the use of this technology . The advancement in 409 knowledge reported here can be applied to further the development of prime editors , as well 410 as in the design of novel therapeutic strategies . 411 412 Methods 413 414 Plasmids and oligos 415 DNA oligos were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies ( IDT ) unless otherwise noted . 416 pCMV - PE2 was a gift from David Liu ( Addgene plasmid # 132775 ) . pLenti PE2 - BSD was a 417 gift from Hyongbum Kim ( Addgene plasmid # 161514 ) ( Kim et al . , 2021 ) . pU6 - pegRNA - GG - 418 acceptor was a gift from David Liu ( Addgene plasmid # 132777 ) .

Genomic DNA was extracted 96 hours after 646 transfection , by removing the medium , resuspending the cells in a lysis solution ( 100 μL 647 DirectPCR Lysis Reagent ( Cell ) ( Viagen Biotech ) , 76 μL of water and 4 μL Proteinase K ) and 648 incubating 45 minutes at 55 o C and 45 minutes at 85 o C . Prime editing efficiency was 649 determined by Sanger sequencing , after amplifying genomic DNA with appropriate primers 650 ( Supplementary Data 2 ) and measured by sequence decomposition using TIDE ( Brinkman 651 et al . , 2014 ) . 652 653 Immunoblotting 654 Cell extracts were prepared in RIPA lysis buffer ( NEB ) supplemented with protease inhibitors 655 ( Sigma ) and phosphatase inhibitors ( Sigma , NEB ) . Immunoblots were performed using 656 standard procedures . Protein samples were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate - 657 polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS - PAGE ) ( 3 – 8 % gradient gels , Invitrogen ) and 658 subsequently transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes . Primary antibodies for MLH1 659 ( 554073 , BD Pharmigen ) , MSH2 ( ab52266 , Abcam ) , MSH3 ( ab69619 , Abcam ) , Tubulin ( 3873 , 660 Cell Signaling ) and ß - Actin ( A5060 , Sigma ) were used at 1 : 1 , 000 . Secondary antibodies were 661 used at 1 : 5 , 000 ( HRP - conjugated goat anti - mouse or anti - rabbit IgG from Jackson 662 Immunochemicals ) . Immunoblots were imaged using a Curix 60 ( AGFA ) table - top processor . 663 664 Immunofluorescence 665 U2OS cells were reverse transfected using PEI ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . 50 , 000 cells were seeded 666 per well of μ - Slide 8 well ( Ibidi ) chambered coverslip plates . Pre - extraction was performed 667 using 0 . 1 % Tween in PBS 24 hours after reverse transfection . Cells were then fixed with 4 % 668 para - formaldehyde and fixed cells were processed for immunofluorescence using the 669 following antibodies : anti - Cas9 ( Cell Signalling , 14697 ) , anti - TRF1 ( Abcam , ab1423 ) , anti - 670 MLH1 ( ThermoFisher , A300 - 015A ) , anti - MSH2 ( Bethyl , A300 - 452A ) , anti - GFP ( Abcam , 671 ab6556 ) . Primary antibodies were diluted 1 : 500 and secondary antibodies ( Alexa Fluor® 568 672 goat anti - mouse and Alexa Fluor® 488 goat anti - rabbit , LifeTechnologies ) were diluted 673 1 : 2 , 000 . 674 675 Imaging 676 16 - bit fluorescence images were acquired using an Olympus IXplore spinning disk confocal 677 microscope ( equipped with the Yokogawa CSU - W1 with 50 µm pinhole disk and a Hamamatsu 678 ORCA Fusion CMOS camera ) . A 60X oil immersion objective ( NA 1 , 42 ) in combination with a 679 3 . 2X magnification lens ( equalling 192X total magnification ) was used for super - resolution 680 23 imaging of fixed cells and z - stacks with a 0 . 24µm slice interval were acquired . These z - stacks 681 were then processed using the Olympus 3D deconvolution software ( constrained iterative 682 deconvolution , using automatic background removal and noise reduction , filter using 683 advanced maximum likelihood algorithm and 5 iterations ) . Finally , “maximum - z” projection 684 images of the deconvoluted z - stacks were generated . For further data analysis , the ImageJ 685 ( NIH ) distribution FIJI was used . Nuclear foci were counted manually and at least 50 cells per 686 condition were imaged in each experiment . Quantification of the foci was performed manually 687 based on maximum intensity projections . 688 689 References 690 Acharya , S . , Wilson , T . , Gradia , T . , Kane , M . , Guerrette , S . , Marsischky , G . , et al .
