Bershadsky , Weizmann Institute of Science , Rehovot , Israel , and accepted by the Editorial Board November 22 , 2011 ( received for review April 21 , 2011 ) The organization of cells into epithelium depends on cell in - teraction with both the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) and adjacent cells . The role of cell – cell adhesion in the regulation of epithelial topology is well - described . ECM is better known to promote cell migration and provide a structural scaffold for cell anchoring , but its contribution to multicellular morphogenesis is less well - under - stood . We developed a minimal model system to investigate how ECM affects the spatial organization of intercellular junctions . Fi - bronectin micropatterns were used to constrain the location of cell – ECM adhesion . We found that ECM affects the degree of sta - bility of intercellular junction positioning and the magnitude of intra - and intercellular forces . Intercellular junctions were perma - nently displaced , and experienced large perpendicular tensional forces as long as they were positioned close to ECM . They remained stable solely in regions deprived of ECM , where they were submit - ted to lower tensional forces . The heterogeneity of the spatial or - ganization of ECM induced anisotropic distribution of mechanical constraints in cells , which seemed to adapt their position to mini - mize both intra - and intercellular forces . These results uncover a morphogenetic role for ECM in the mechanical regulation of cells and intercellular junction positioning . tissue architecture | cytoskeleton | actin | traction force | integrin cadherin crosstalk E pithelial sheets lie on a layer of extracellular matrix ( ECM ) , the so - called basement membrane . In such epithelia , cells establish integrin - based adhesions on the basal part of the cell in contact with ECM , and cadherin - based intercellular adhesions on the apical part of contacting lateral domains , away from contact with ECM . The two adhesion systems display non - overlapping spatial distributions . Both cell – cell and cell – ECM adhesions are required to establish proper epithelium morphol - ogy ( 1 ) . They both participate in mechano - transduction of ex - ternal physical cues into intracellular signaling ( 2 ) . The biochemical nature of adhesion molecules engaged in intercellular adhesion , the energy of the interaction , as well as the mechanical tension developed along intercellular junctions have been shown to govern epithelial cell shape and orient intercellular junctions in various systems ( 3 – 6 ) . However , whereas the contribution of cell – cell adhesion to epithelial topology has been the focus of many studies , much less attention has been paid to the role of ECM . ECM is a dynamic scaffold that is actively remodeled during morphogenesis , where it plays major roles in stimulating and guiding cell migration as well as orienting stem cell fate ( 7 , 8 ) . ECM is also known to impart morphoregulatory signals to epi - thelia , and thereby regulates tissue morphogenesis ( 8 , 9 ) . How - ever , the mechanism by which ECM guides cell positioning at the single - cell scale is still not known . ECM geometry has been shown to regulate intracellular architecture ( 10 ) and provide spatial information for cell polarization ( 1 , 11 , 12 ) , but how it regulates cell positioning and thereby spatially organizes multi - cellular architectures remained to be investigated . Results Intercellular Junctions Are Stabilized in Regions Deprived of ECM . The effect of the spatial distribution of ECM on the localization of MCF10A intercellular junctions was investigated by control - ling the location of ECM with ﬁ bronectin micropatterns ( 13 , 14 ) ( SI Methods ) . To provide a maximum degree of freedom to the intercellular junction and to minimize the number of parameters participating in its positioning , we focused our analysis on cell doublets , formed by daughter cells after mitosis . The positioning of cells , as revealed by the spatial coordinates of their nucleus , was recorded by time - lapse microscopy during a complete cell cycle and automatically quanti ﬁ ed ( Fig . S1 , Movie S1 , and SI Methods ) . We measured the angular distribution of the nucleus – nucleus axis as well as the proportion of time during which cells were moving . As expected from previous work ( 15 ) , cells were almost randomly positioned and turned steadily around each other on [ square ] - shaped micropatterns ( Fig . 1 A and Movie S2 ) . Under such conditions , ECM is present all along the contour of the cell doublet and provides a continuous peripheral track for cell movement . Because in epithelia , cadherins tend to ﬂ ow from the ECM - rich basal pole to the ECM - free apical pole ( 16 ) , we tested whether the absence of ECM could stabilize the in - tercellular junction and interfere with cell movement . [ H ] - shaped micropatterns were designed to provide two large regions devoid of ECM . In striking contrast to their behavior on [ square ] , a large proportion of cell doublets on [ H ] did not move at all , resulting in highly stable con ﬁ gurations in which cells were positioned on each side of the gap ( Fig . 1 B and Movie S3 ) . We further tested whether the nuclear axis was perpendicular to the intercellular junction by staining E - cadherin on ﬁ xed cells . We con ﬁ rmed that the intercellular junctions were positioned over the gap where ECM was absent ( Fig . 1 D and E ) . On [ H ] , the absence of ECM was probably not the only factor contributing to cell - doublet stabilization .

[ Hourglass ] - shaped micropatterns were designed to provide both a continuous peripheral track for cell movement and two regions along the cell - doublet contour in which ECM was absent ( Fig . 1 C ) . Thereby we could test the speci ﬁ c effect of ECM on intercellular junction positioning un - der conditions where migration was not impaired . Analysis of both nucleus position and junction position con ﬁ rmed that cell doublets tend to stabilize their positions in con ﬁ gurations where their intercellular junction lies above regions deprived of ECM ( Fig . 1 C and F ) . Under these conditions , the central part of the junction lies above ECM . However , cadherins tend to concen - trate at the extremity of the junction ( 17 ) , where most of the intercellular force is applied ( 18 ) , and we could show that it is indeed the absence of ECM at the extremity and not in the central part of the junction that stabilizes junction displacements ( Fig . S2 ) . Notably , these orientations of cell doublets did not merely result from the orientation of the mother cell division but instead implied an active repositioning mechanism of the in - tercellular junction in response to ECM geometry ( Fig . S3 ) . If epithelial cells actively tend to form their intercellular junction away from ECM , the geometry of ECM and the size of ECM - deprived regions should directly regulate the degree of stability of the intercellular junction positioning . We tested this hypothesis by varying the size of the gap in [ C ] - shaped micro - patterns ( Fig . 2 ) . As the gap size increased from 7 to 20 μ m , the proportion of cells with the intercellular junction positioned over the gap increased progressively , whereas the proportion of cell movement gradually decreased ( Fig . 2 ) . Intercellular Junctions Are Destabilized by the Presence of ECM . To further con ﬁ rm whether ECM promotes intercellular junction displacement , we tested a complementary approach in which ECM was added along a stable intercellular junction position . To that end , we ﬁ rst designed a micropattern geometry in which cell doublets could adopt two stable con ﬁ gurations . On [ cross ] , the intercellular junction was positioned along the midlines , either horizontally or vertically , within the two large regions devoid of ECM ( Fig . 3 A ) . Cell - doublet angular speed was high when the intercellular junction passed over ECM - rich diagonals . It slowed down when the junction passed over ECM - free midlines ( Fig . 3 C ) . When ECM was introduced along the horizontal midline , the cell – cell junction was no longer slowed down along this axis , and cell doublets could not adopt the corresponding orientation anymore ( Fig . 3 B and C ) . From these experiments , we concluded that the proximity of cell – cell adhesion sites with ECM promotes the displacement of the intercellular junction , whereas the distance between cell adhesion sites and ECM stabilizes it . Regulation of Tensional Forces Is Implicated in Intercellular Junction Guidance by ECM . To further investigate the molecular mechanism governing intercellular junction positioning in response to ECM geometry , we inactivated some of the signaling pathways spe - ci ﬁ cally associated with cell adhesion and modi ﬁ ed the formation 81624 % 90° 180° 270° orientation of nucleus - nucleus axis N cell = 146 N angle = 8561 100 60 20 proportion of moving frames ( % ) 8 24 90° 180° 270° 40 % 100 60 20 B C E - c a d h e r i n a c t i n a v e r a g e d E - c a d h e r i n n = 23 max min n = 16 max min 100 60 20 n = 18 max min A E F D E - c a d h e r i n a c t i n a v e r a g e d E - c a d h e r i n E - c a d h e r i n a c t i n a v e r a g e d E - c a d h e r i n 0° 81624 % 90° 180° 270° orientation of nucleus - nucleus axis proportion of moving frames ( % ) 0° N cell = 117 N angle = 5442 0° orientation of nucleus - nucleus axis proportion of moving frames ( % ) N cell = 69 N angle = 3991 Fig . 1 .

We tested the effects of these treatments on cell doublets plated on the [ hourglass ] , because this geometry guides intercellular junction positioning without impairing cell migration . We quan - ti ﬁ ed the orientation of the intercellular junction and the precise positions of its extremities on ﬁ xed cells stained for α - catenin ( Fig . 4 A ) . Under control conditions , most intercellular junction extremities were positioned intheregiondeprivedofECM , on both sides of the narrow part of the [ hourglass ] ( Fig . 4 B and Fig . S4 ) . This phenotype was not signi ﬁ cantly perturbed by the inhibition of FAK , ERK , JNK , Rac , or Src , which are the main kinases con - veying biochemical signaling from cell adhesions ( 19 ) ( Fig . 4 B and Fig . S4 ) . However , intercellular junction position and orienta - tion were strongly perturbed by the inactivation of cell con - traction using either Rho kinase inhibition or myosin II inhibition ( Fig . 4 B and E and Fig . S4 ) . Down - regulation of focal adhesion proteins , on which traction forces are applied , im - paired cell spreading and precluded the analysis of their speci ﬁ c contribution to intercellular junction positioning . However , cell spreading on laminin , which is known to engage a distinct subset of integrins than ﬁ bronectin ( 20 ) , signi ﬁ cantly perturbed junc - tion positioning ( Fig . 4 C and E and Fig . S4 ) and thereby showed that this positioning was directly regulated by the nature of the cell – ECM interactions . We then tried to perturb the assembly of junctional complexes that are able to transfer the forces applied on ECM to the adjacent cells . Down - regulation of p120 - catenin by siRNA treatment is known to affect intercellular junction turnover and actin dynamics ( 21 ) . It signi ﬁ cantly perturbed junction positioning ( Fig . 4 D and E and Fig . S4 ) . These results suggested that the production of mechanical forces on in - tercellular junctions was responsible for junction positioning away from ECM .

Defor - mations of polyacrylamide gels were used to measure the forces exerted by cell doublets on the substrate ( 23 – 25 ) ( Fig . 5 A ) and indirectly derive the forces they exert on each other ( 26 ) ( SI Methods ) . The analysis of force balance in cell doublets on [ square ] and [ H ] revealed that intercellular forces were signi ﬁ - cantly reduced when intercellular junction extremities lay above ECM gaps ( Fig . 5 B ) . Because intercellular tension reduction on [ H ] could result from a decrease in global traction force rather than a speci ﬁ c decrease of the intercellular force , we calculated the ratio between the intercellular force and the total traction force . Like the intercellular force , this ratio was lower when the junction was stabilized over ECM gaps ( Fig . 5 B ) . To further explain how large traction forces on sites ﬂ anking ECM gaps could be associated with reduced levels of intercellular forces over such gaps , we analyzed force orientations depending on the 0 100 200 300 0 100 200 300 0 100 200 0 0 . 5 1 A B C intra adhesive inter adhesive intra adhesive inter non - adhesive Force ( nN ) Force ( nN ) D Cell - cell force ( nN ) Ratio cell - cell / total force * * * * * ns * * * = −Σ F i F cell - cell 100 200 300 400 500 100 200 300 400 500 n = 30 n = 33 n = 30 n = 33 1500 pN 250 500 750 1000 1250 ECM independent J intra = J inter = 1 J cell - cell = 0 . 1 E F inter intra inter cell - cell H = 2 .

The various orientations of the in - tercellular junction can be described by a simple energy function H takinginto account the length L and the tensionJ along all edges of the cell doublets . The two curves corre - spond to numerical simulations of the energy function for various junction orientations when the tension depends ( red ) or not ( blue ) on the local presence of ECM . A favored orientation ( junction orientation at 0° ) , corresponding to ex - perimental observations , only occurs when tension depends on ECM . Tseng et al .

Traction forces at cell apices were decomposed into a component perpendicular to the junction , considered as contributing mainly to intercellular forces , and a component parallel to the junction , considered as contributing mainly to intracellular forces ( Fig . 5 D ) . This component of the traction perpendicular to the junction was a good approximation of the global cell – cell force ( Fig . S5 ) . On [ square ] , intercellular forces along ECM - rich edges were equivalent to intracellular forces . However , on [ H ] , intercellular forces along ECM - free edges were almost half the strength of intracellular forces ( Fig . 5 D ) . We further compared the intra - and intercellular forces on var - ious micropattern shapes ( Fig . S6 ) and found that the presence of ECM had an opposite effect on each : It reduced intracellular forces but increased intercellular forces ( Fig . 5 E ) . Overall Tension Minimization Accounts for Cell Positioning . To test whether the regulation of intra - and intercellular forces in re - sponse to the presence of ECM could account for the favored cell positioning we observed , we performed numerical simu - lations to take into account all cortical forces and compare the energetic costs of all cell positions . We used a well - established physical model of the energy associated with the development of cortical forces ( 4 , 27 ) and applied it to the simpli ﬁ ed case of cells having a ﬁ xed area ( 28 ) ( Fig . 5 F and SI Methods ) . Numerical simulations showed that when tension was considered to be in - dependent of the presence of ECM , all cell orientations had approximately the same energetic cost . However , when we in - corporated into the model the relative differences of tension we measured in response to the presence of ECM , the tension along cell edges became anisotropic , and the con ﬁ gurations associated with the lower total energy actually corresponded to those we observed experimentally ( Fig . 5 F and Fig . S7 ) . This suggested that cell positioning could actually result from minimization of global tension in response to ECM geometry . Discussion Here we described the development of an experimental system to study multicellular morphogenesis . Although this system partly lacks some of the physiological characteristics found in situ in an - imal systems ( 3 ) and in vitro in 3D cyst formation ( 29 , 30 ) , it offers the possibility of quantifying cell movement and accurately mea - suring the spatial distribution of forces in a large number of re - producible assays . In addition , the ﬁ ne manipulation of ECM geometry allows precise control of the degree of freedom for cell movements . Thus , although spatially con ﬁ ned , multiple cells can reveal their natural self - assembly process . ECM has been shown to guide tissue morphogenesis by modu - lating cell – cell interactions ( 31 , 32 ) . The biochemical , structural , and mechanical interactions between cell – ECM and cell – cell adhesions have been well - characterized ( 2 , 33 , 34 ) . However , how these interactions translate into spatial organization of multicellu - lar arrangements remained to be clari ﬁ ed . Our results suggest that intercellular junction positioning away from ECM did not result from the action of a single ECM signal . Indeed , most of the main signaling pathways associated with cell – ECM adhesion could be impaired individually without affecting junction position , at least in therange of inhibitorconcentration andthe time window wetested . Neither did it result from oriented cell divisions . Instead , it ap - peared to stem from ECM - regulated production of intra - and in - tercellular forces and overall minimization of global tension . We found that the contact of intercellular junctions with ECM caused the displacement of the cell – cell junction and the pro - duction of large perpendicular tensional forces and constant motion of the cells . In support of these ﬁ ndings , work from others has shown that cell adhesion to ECM alters cell – cell ad - hesion and promotes the development of large tensional forces responsible for junction disruption and subsequent cell migration ( 35 , 36 ) . In addition , we found that when cells place their in - tercellular junction on ECM - deprived regions , intra - and in - tercellular tension gets reduced and cell position is stabilized ( Fig . 6 ) . How cell interaction with ECM regulates inter - and intracellular forces in an opposed way remains to be elucidated . We suspect this involves complex interplays between the growth and dynamics of several types of actin - based structures formed in proximity to cell – ECM and cell – cell contacts . Anisotropic distribution of forces along the cell periphery has been shown to regulate cell shape , junction remodeling , and cell spatial repositioning within tissues ( 3 ) . Our results suggest that ECM could participate in similar morphogenetic processes . In response to heterogeneous distribution of ECM , cell doublets developed anisotropic force ﬁ elds and adopted stable positions along the axis of low tension . According to this mechanism , cells tend to stabilize the position of their intercellular junctions away from ECM . This could account for many important processes during epithelium morphogenesis ( Fig . 6 ) . For example , during tubulogenesis , cells ﬁ rst form a single - ﬁ le chain of cells . This stage , during which cell – cell junctions are close to ECM , is only transient . Cells reorganize and move their junctions away from ECM to form a multilayered cord with a central lumen ( 30 , 37 ) . During this transformation , intracellular forces that were de - veloped across the ECM gap get relocalized along ECM ﬁ bers , whereas intercellular forces undergo the opposite reorientation . According to the mechanism we describe , this transformation would be favored by the relaxation of both intra - and inter - cellular tensions ( Fig . 6 ) . Although much attention has been paid to the role of cell – cell interaction in the shaping of epithelia , our results suggest that we should also consider the organizing role of ECM , which , far from being a mere supporting scaffold , plays an instructive role in regulating mechanical forces and orienting multicellu - lar assembly . Methods Cell Culture . The culture of mammary epithelial cells MCF10A was described previously ( 38 ) . Cells were seeded on patterned substrates at a density of 8 × 10 4 / cm 2 . Cells not attaching to the adhesive region on the substrate were unstable high inter - cellular forces high intra - cellular forces moving inter - cellular junction low inter - cellular forces low intra - cellular forces non moving inter - cellular junction stable inter - cellular junctions in contact with the ECM inter - cellular junctions away from the ECM Fig . 6 . Summary and illustration . On micropatterns , cells develop elevated intra - and intercellular tension when the intercellular junction is in contact with ECM ( Left ) and reduced tension when it is far from ECM ( Right ) . In situ , as shown here in the case of tubulogenesis , this mechanism would promote the relocalization of junctions away from ECM and the formation of multi - layered structures of opposed polarities .

Fixed cells were incubated with a 1 : 200 dilution of anti - α - catenin ( B52975 ; Calbiochem ) or a 1 : 50 dilution of anti - E - cadherin ( sc8426 ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) for 1 h , and then incubated with cor - responding secondary antibodies and FITC - phalloidin ( Invitrogen ) at 1 μ g / mL for 30 min . Traction Force Microscopy . Images of ﬂ uorescent beads with and without cell doublets were ﬁ rst aligned to correct experimental drift using the ImageJ plugin “ align slices in stack . ” The displacement ﬁ eld was subsequently calculated by a custom - written particle image velocimetry ( PIV ) program implemented as an ImageJ ( http : / / rsb . info . nih . gov / ij ) plugin . The PIV was performed through an iterative scheme . In each iteration , the displacement was calculated by the normalized correlation coef ﬁ cient algorithm , so that an individual interrogation window was compared with a larger searching window . The next iteration takes into account the displacement ﬁ eld mea - sured previously , so that a false correlation peak due to insuf ﬁ cient image features is avoided . The normalized cross - correlation also allowed us to de ﬁ ne an arbitrary threshold to ﬁ lter out low correlation values due to in - suf ﬁ cient beads presented in the window . The resulting ﬁ nal grid size for the displacement ﬁ eld was 1 . 63 × 1 . 63 μ m , with six beads per interrogation window on average . The erroneous displacement vectors due to insuf ﬁ cient beads present in the window were ﬁ ltered out by their low correlation value and replaced by the median value from the neighboring vectors . With the displacement ﬁ eld obtained from the PIV analysis , the traction force ﬁ eld was reconstructed by the Fourier transform traction cytometry ( FTTC ) method with regularized scheme ( 25 ) on the same grid ( 1 . 63 × 1 . 63 μ m ) without further interpolation or remapping . The regularization parameter was set at 9 × 10 − 10 for all traction force reconstructions . The FTTC code was also written in Java as an ImageJ plugin , so that the whole traction force microscopy procedure from PIV to force calculation could be performed with ImageJ .
