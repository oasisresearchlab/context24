Identifying and quantifying the importance of these settings is critical for designing 3 interventions . A tightly - knit religious community in the UK experienced a very large COVID - 19 epidemic 4 in 2020 , reaching 64 . 3 % seroprevalence within 10 months , and we surveyed this community both for 5 serological status and individual - level attendance at particular settings . Using these data , and a network 6 model of people and places represented as a stochastic graph rewriting system , we estimated the relative 7 contribution of transmission in households , schools and religious institutions to the epidemic , and the 8 relative risk of infection in each of these settings . All congregate settings were important for transmission , 9 with some such as primary schools and places of worship having a higher share of transmission than 10 others . We found that the model needed a higher general - community transmission rate for women ( 3 . 3 - 11 fold ) , and lower susceptibility to infection in children to recreate the observed serological data . The 12 precise share of transmission in each place was related to assumptions about the internal structure of 13 those places . Identiﬁcation of key settings of transmission can allow public health interventions to be 14 targeted at these locations . 15 Keywords : COVID - 19 , Ethnic Minorities , Epidemic Model , Stochastic Graph Rewriting 16 1 Introduction 17 The transmission dynamics of SARS - CoV - 2 in settings such as households ( 1 – 5 ) , schools ( 6 – 8 ) and work - 18 places ( 9 , 10 ) has been the subject of considerable interest , since understanding the relative risk of transmis - 19 sion by setting ( 11 – 15 ) enables more eﬀective targeting of public health interventions ( 16 – 22 ) to minimise 20 the extent and impact of the epidemic . Characterisation of transmission dynamics and evaluation of inter - 21 ventions is often done with agent - based or network models where the network structure is either generated 22 synthetically ( 23 , 24 ) or inferred from mobility data ( 25 , 26 ) . However , because dynamics are formulated in 23 terms of interactions between individuals , the role of setting is implicit and can only be measured indirectly . 24 1 .

There is a need for further investigation into the importance of diﬀerent transmission settings . Ideally 25 information on attendance at those settings would be coupled with evidence of infection , to allow the 26 relative importance of each setting to be disentangled . 27 We developed a transmission model where setting is explicit to examine the role of diﬀering types of 28 places and their relative contribution to SARS - CoV - 2 transmission in a strictly - Orthodox Jewish commu - 29 nity in the UK . 30 We previously documented ( 27 ) 64 . 3 % ( 95 % CI 61 . 6 - 67 . 0 % ) SARS - CoV - 2 seroprevalence in Novem - 31 ber 2020 in this community which was more than ﬁve times the estimated seroprevalence of the wider 32 metropolitan area ( 28 ) . Because we collected data on attendance at community institutions from all mem - 33 bers of 394 households , approximately 10 % of the total community’s population . These data aﬀord a 34 unique opportunity to estimate the relative contributions of diﬀerent settings to SARS - CoV - 2 transmis - 35 sion and to understand what dynamics could have given rise to the particular pattern of seroprevalence 36 observed . 37 To analyse transmission , we represented the community as a bipartite network of people and places . 38 We constructed a transmission model using an extended version of the kappa - calculus ( 29 ) to implement 39 a transmission model as a stochastic graph rewriting system ( 30 , 31 ) , a generalalisation of how explicit 40 epidemic dynamics are usually formulated on networks ( 32 ) . In this model , individuals have disease 41 progression states and transmission is mediated by place , with a separate transmission process for each 42 setting or kind of place . These place - mediated transmission processes are augmented with population - wide 43 well - mixed transmission processes akin to general community transmission outside of the deﬁned set of 44 places . We ﬁt the transmission rate parameters of this model to the measured distributions of positive test 45 results from the seroprevalence survey . We used the ﬁtted model to analyse the contribution of diﬀerent 46 places to transmission within the community . 47 2 Results 48 2 . 1 Structure of the social network of people and places 49 We surveyed 1 , 942 people in 374 households from a community of approximately 20 , 000 people in November 50 and early December 2020 . 33 % of the population were under 10 years of age and 60 % under 20 , which 51 which is a higher percentage than the surrounding metropolitan area . Survey data included household 52 membership and composition , which school children attended , which place of worship individuals attended , 53 and which ritual bath adult men attended ( adult men attend ritual baths collectively , women attend 54 individually but no speciﬁc data were available about the latter ) . 1 , 377 people from 309 households also 55 provided a blood sample from which we found 64 . 3 % had IgG antibodies to the SARS - CoV - 2 spike protein , 56 ranging from 50 % in under 10 year olds to 75 % in over 10 year olds ( 27 ) . 57 We observed a strong partitioning of attendance at places by both age and sex ( Figure 1 B , C ) . Schools , 58 both primary ( under 13 ) and secondary ( 13 and over ) , were predominantly segregated by sex . The vast 59 majority of individuals reporting a connection with a place of worship and all of those reporting attendance 60 at a ritual bath were adult ( 18 + ) men . 61 We used the information reported in the household survey to generate a bipartite network of people 62 and places ( illustrative example in Figure 1A . In this network there is an edge between every individual 63 and each place with which they reported an association . We found that the greatest mean degree was in 64 primary schools , and the least within households ( Table 1 ) . 65 2 . 2 Transmission and relative risk 66 Using a transmission model with varying susceptibility to infection by age , we ﬁtted the rate parameters for 67 each setting to the empirical distributions of household infection from the serosurvey using the sequential 68 2 .

Monte - Carlo method for approximate Bayesian computation ( 33 ) ( Figure 2C , Table 1 ) . As well as place - 69 mediated transmission processes , we included several transmission processes directly between individuals . 70 These transmission processes distinguish susceptibility by age group to account for reduced susceptibility 71 of children ( 34 ) and account for a diﬀerence in general community transmission to women because we lack 72 data about places frequented by adult women . 73 Using the place - mediated transmission rate parameters , the model also freely ( i . e . without ﬁtting ) 74 reproduced the overall seroprevalence of 65 % measured in the population as well as the age - speciﬁc sero - 75 prevalence ( Figure 2 D ) though exhibits a male - female asymmetry that was not present in the empirical 76 data , clearly visible in Figure S1 . This asymmetry is due to a lack of explicit data about which places adult 77 women have a connection with which cannot be captured by a place - mediated transmission process . To 78 mitigate this , we used an additional well - mixed transmission process for adult women described in more 79 detail in Methods . We additionally found that it was not possible to accurately reproduce prevalence in 80 children assuming age - independent susceptibility Figure S1 . When children were assumed to be on average 81 50 % less susceptible than adults in line with other studies ( 34 ) then prevalence more closely matched the 82 empirical estimates . 83 We found that the highest share of transmission within the surveyed population was attributable to 84 households at 24 % [ 95 % CI : 20 - 28 % ] ( Figure 2 A ) , and the lowest to secondary schools at 5 . 1 % [ 3 . 4 - 7 . 0 % ] . 85 The share of transmission outside of places , i . e . the background community rate was 14 % [ 11 - 18 % ] . This 86 result was stable : and the strongest estimates of transmission rate ( e . g . the parameter with the lowest 87 variance in its posterior distribution and the least sensitivity to changes in network topology ) are for general 88 community transmission ( Figure S2 ) . That households are identiﬁed as the largest share of transmission 89 is perhaps not surprising as every individual belongs to a household but not necessarily to any other 90 setting . Transmission in places of worship was comparable to but slightly lower than households at 23 % 91 [ 19 - 28 % ] . Finally , primary schools at 20 % [ 17 - 25 % ] , and ritual baths account for about 12 % [ 9 . 5 - 15 % ] of 92 total transmission . 93 The relative risk of transmission in each place is the amount of transmission in a place relative to the 94 total amount of transmission possible in that setting ( Figure 2 B ) . Thus , for households the distribution 95 was centered at 16 % [ 12 - 19 % ] which can be interpreted as the relative risk of being infected in the household 96 setting . This quantity is related to the household secondary attack rate but without distinguishing between 97 single and multiple infections acquired elsewhere introduced into the household . All other settings had a 98 greater risk with considerable variance ( primary schools 38 % [ 28 - 47 % ] , secondary schools 41 % [ 31 - 49 % ] , 99 places of worship 38 % [ 31 - 45 % ] , and ritual baths 40 % [ 32 - 47 % ] ) . The background risk of infection in the 100 community was 9 . 3 % [ 6 . 6 - 12 % ] . 101 To facilitate comparisons with other studies of COVID - 19 transmission in households , from the ﬁtted 102 transmission rate parameters we calculated the susceptible - infectious transmission probability ( SITP ) ( 35 , 103 3 .

This is the probability that a single infectious individual transmits the virus to a single susceptible 104 individual in a given place , when both are in the reference age group ( adults ) for each household size . 105 These values are shown in Table 2 . Similar quantities can be deﬁned for other settings , but with much 106 larger population sizes the per - pair transmission probabilities are much smaller and diﬃcult to compare 107 across settings . Therefore , we also report the average number of secondary cases a single initial infective 108 in the reference age class would generate in each setting , if all other members were susceptible and in the 109 reference age class . In households , we found this to be 0 . 52 [ 0 . 46 - 0 . 56 ] . For other deﬁned settings we found 110 0 . 56 [ 0 . 50 - 0 . 59 ] for primary schools , 0 . 64 [ 0 . 58 - 0 . 67 ] for secondary schools , 0 . 58 [ 0 . 52 - 0 . 63 ] for places of 111 worship , and 0 . 61 [ 0 . 56 - 0 . 64 ] for ritual baths . 112 2 . 3 Multiple household introductions 113 To determine the most frequent route of introduction of infection into a household we calculated the route of 114 introduction for each household size from our simulations . We found that a minority of transmission events 115 occurred within households , stabilising at 24 % [ 0 - 62 % ] for the larger households ( Figure 3 ) . Examining the 116 distribution of transmission events by source for each household size in more detail ( SI Figure 5 ) we found 117 that the most common situation was a single introduction from any given source , the exception being 118 primary schools and to a lesser extent places of worship which commonly produced multiple infections 119 for households of size greater than 6 . This is consistent with an epidemic with an appreciable amount of 120 transmission pressure from outside households . 121 2 . 4 The role of network structure 122 Our model is characterised by six transmission mechanisms corresponding to the ﬁve types of place and the 123 general community . The degree distributions for some settings , primary schools and places of worship in 124 particular , were very skewed , with a small number of very large places . We hypothesised that large places 125 may have internal structure such as classrooms in schools , or prayer groups during religious observance at 126 places of worship and that it may be inaccurate to represent them as uniformly mixed environments . To 127 determine sensitivity to place size , we split these large places into several smaller places to capture internal 128 structure within those places . The splitting was done such that the total number of edges to each type of 129 place were preserved , and transmission rate parameters were unchanged ; only the number of places was 130 modiﬁed . 131 We found that there was an inﬂuence of ﬁne structure but this did not substantially aﬀect the dis - 132 tribution of positive tests ( Figure 4 ) . If places of worship are constrained to be no larger than the 50th 133 percentile , a reduction of approximately 20 % of the peak epidemic size as well as the overall attack rate 134 can be achieved , however sizes above this value have minimal eﬀect . A further reduction by 40 - 60 % can be 135 further achieved if places of worship are made very small , though below the 30th percentile this essentially 136 corresponds to closing them . The eﬀect of smaller school sizes is similar but less pronounced . A 20 % 137 reduction in both peak and overall epidemic size can be achieved by closing schools and , short of such a 138 drastic step , smaller school sizes yields approximately a 10 % reduction . The percentile diﬀered between 139 places of worship and schools , where the 50th percentile was critical in the former ( Supplementary section 140 4 .

We did ﬁnd an eﬀect on the 141 relative share of transmission attributable to diﬀerent settings as well as the relative risk . The uncertainty 142 in these observations is relatively high and at the most optimistic , smaller school sizes could produce as 143 much as a 30 % improvement only splitting at the 50th percentile and still be within the 95 % conﬁdence 144 intervals . Correspondingly , splitting places of worship at the 50th percentile could yield as much as a 40 % 145 improvement in the epidemic trajectory . 146 We also tested the sensitivity of the results to network size , and found that removing up to 20 % of 147 households or adding up to 20 % has little eﬀect on the household distributions of positive tests or the 148 setting - speciﬁc share of overall transmission or relative risk . This suggests that the sampled population 149 was suﬃciently large for the present analysis to generalise to the whole population . However , increasing 150 the network size does increase the share of transmission from general well - mixed activity in the community 151 ( see Supplementary Section E ) . It is well - known that a well - mixed dynamic overestimates transmission ( 32 ) 152 and the addition of more individuals emphasises the role of this mechanism . 153 3 Discussion 154 We have estimated the relative contribution of diﬀerent settings to transmission using explicit people - and 155 place - data in this community . We found that the highest share of transmission within the community was 156 within households , followed by places of worship and primary schools in approximately equal measure . By 157 calculating the relative risk of attending each of these places , we found that primary and secondary schools 158 as well as ritual baths and places of worship had very similar risks . Households have been identiﬁed as an 159 important source of transmission since the beginning of the pandemic ( 37 ) , potentially becoming a higher 160 fraction of transmission during physical - distancing interventions , which could increase the amount of time 161 spent within households . 162 The relative risk of other settings was higher where adults and children congregate separately . The 163 importance of schools within total community transmission varied between primary and secondary schools . 164 However , only 155 individuals reported an association with secondary schools compared with 686 for pri - 165 mary schools . We found that the relative transmission risk for primary and secondary schools was approx - 166 imately equal , so the share of total transmission attributable to secondary schools would be comparable 167 if the number of individuals attending were similar . Given the young population , the large proportion of 168 transmission in schools is not surprising and this result may not be generalisable to older populations with 169 a smaller proportion of people in school or similar settings . 170 We found that by limiting the eﬀective size of gatherings in places of worship to be smaller than the 171 median size , that the peak size of a COVID - 19 epidemic in such a tightly knit religious community can 172 be signiﬁcantly reduced even as the overall size of the epidemic is less aﬀected due to the presence of 173 other transmission pathways . A similar , though less pronounced eﬀect is visible with primary schools ; the 174 eﬀect is smaller due to lower susceptibility of children ( 34 ) . Nearly 200 years ago , Rabbi Eiger wrote of 175 interventions against epidemic cholera : 176 “In my view , it is true that gathering in a small space is inappropriate , but it is possible to 177 pray in groups , each one very small – about 15 people altogether . The groups should begin with 178 ﬁrst light and then another group , and each one should have a designated time to come and 179 pray there . ” 180 – Letter from Rabbi Akiva Eiger , Posen , 1831 181 Though this would likely have had little eﬀect for limiting the spread of cholera the overall message is 182 strikingly similar for COVID - 19 , and likely for similarly - transmitted infections . 183 These results also emphasise the importance of structure in the contact patterns of the population . In 184 the case of this study , this is evident with the larger schools and places of worship but the principle could 185 reasonably be extended to workplaces . Schools are divided into classes , group lessons take place at places 186 5 .

It 187 is reasonable to expect some mixing between classes but the majority of time spent in proximity is within 188 a class group . We found that accounting for this eﬀect reduced the overall contribution of these settings 189 which indicates caution in interpreting studies involving transmission in large settings that do not consider 190 heterogeneity within them . 191 Strictly - Orthodox Judaism consists of diverse groups but can be characterised by stringent interpreta - 192 tions of Jewish law ( halachah ) , which governs almost every aspect of daily life and most relevant for this 193 study , social roles of and relations between men and women ( 38 , 39 ) . Activities unique to men in this 194 population , as compared to the wider UK population , include three - times daily collective prayer , religious 195 study , and daily immersion in ritual baths . Moreover , strictly - Orthodox Jews often maintain some social 196 and spatial separation from the wider metropolitan population that has implications for education and 197 adult employment patterns . Strictly - Orthodox communities have larger youth populations and due to 198 larger household sizes , within metropolitan areas , there is often household overcrowding ( 40 , 41 ) . These 199 factors may potentially aﬀect the generalisability of the transmission rates to the entire population : for 200 example , the contributions of places of worship and ritual baths in this subpopulation are far higher than 201 they would be in a population that does not attend these places . In other populations there may be 202 settings such as certain kinds of workplaces that play a similar role in transmission ( 42 ) . We did ﬁnd a 203 substantial contribution of school settings to transmission in this high - prevalence setting , consistent with 204 some ﬁndings of the contributions of schools to transmission in moderate prevalence settings ( 22 ) . The 205 techniques that we developed to conduct this analysis do generalise and can usefully be applied to other 206 populations where appropriate data is available . Cognate data would include households and schools and 207 could sensibly include workplaces for which we do not have explicit information from this survey . 208 The probability of transmission in each setting , as measured by the SITP , was comparable for households 209 to other studies in the UK ( 36 ) based on prevalence , but higher than those calculated for traced contacts ( 43 , 210 44 ) . The estimates for community transmission are higher than those found for other populations ( 43 ) , 211 which is not surprising given that strictly - Orthodox communities have practices and requirements that 212 may increase the chance of repeated contacts , compared with the wider population . 213 We did not have explicit information about all possible places that community members attend , for 214 example workplaces , and some respondents indicated non - speciﬁc responses for attendance at places of 215 worship . To address this , we augmented the setting - speciﬁc transmission model with general community 216 transmission and this improved the ﬁt to the seroprevalence data . This indicates that transmission outside 217 of those places that are explicitly represented is relevant . The lack of information was particularly marked 218 for adult women about whom we have the least place - based information . In strictly - Orthodox Jewish 219 communities women do not , as a rule , regularly attend places of worship and when attending ritual baths 220 they do so alone ( apart , perhaps from a shared waiting area ) whereas for men it is a group activity . We 221 know from the serological data that women became infected at approximately the same rate as men . We 222 compensated for this lack of information in the survey data with an additional well - mixed transmission 223 mechanism by which adult women may become infected and added a ﬁtting penalty for sex asymmetry . 224 These mechanisms necessarily mean that a smaller proportion of transmission events were simulated to 225 occur households . Nevertheless , we ﬁnd that the overall amount of transmission outside of explicitly known 226 places was relatively small , accounting for about 14 % of the total . We can therefore conclude that the 227 majority of transmission is captured by the setting - speciﬁc part of the model . 228 At the time of data collection in November and early December 2020 , the second wave of the COVID - 229 19 epidemic was beginning . At various times from March 2020 through to the time of the survey , UK 230 government interventions such as closure and reopening of schools and places of worship , and stay at 231 home orders had changed . We have anecdotal evidence from communal leaders of signiﬁcant eﬀort among 232 residents to adhere to these measures and strong motivation on their part as leaders to ﬁnd culturally 233 appropriate solutions to reduce local transmission rates . Indeed the project that produced our previous 234 article ( 27 ) and the present one was initiated from within the community . However , we have little speciﬁc 235 6 .

The common strategy of estimating this for 237 populations from mobility data , for example , is not available here . We therefore took a time - homogeneous 238 approach to estimate the overall eﬀect of interventions and measures over this time - period to reproduce 239 the cross - sectional data that was available . 240 We used an extension of the κ - calculus ( 29 ) , in κ language for this study , which is a rule - based stochastic 241 process calculus that is best understood as a graph rewriting system ( 30 , 31 ) for labelled site graphs . It has 242 been extensively used in its original form in molecular biology to study the dynamics of interacting large 243 molecules or polymers , and has been shown to be applicable to population biology and epidemics ( 45 ) . 244 Here we have applied the method to epidemics on networks in a real - world setting for the ﬁrst time . We 245 exploited the rule - based formulations to include several distinct processes : infection in diﬀerent settings , 246 infection of subpopulations within the community , and disease progression . To implement the setting - 247 speciﬁc transmission processes we extended the κ - calculus from site graphs to generalise to places with an 248 unlimited number of edges connecting them to individuals , and rules parameterized by graph nodes . These 249 generalisations are a small step in the direction envisioned by the theory of stochastic bigraphs ( 46 ) . 250 We have constructed a transmission model suited to this kind of network , but there is ample scope for 251 further development for example , a dynamic network that removes edges to capture changing practices 252 over the course of the epidemic , household - or self - isolation , or incorporating within - host immune response 253 models and the interaction of these phenomena with the epidemic at a population level . 254 We found an important role played by diﬀerent settings of transmission in a strictly - Orthodox Jewish 255 community in the UK . This study underlines the inﬂuence of structure within institutions for understanding 256 transmission , and it follows that altering this structure for example with cohorting strategies , smaller groups 257 and class sizes can be a useful measure to reduce transmission . This study also shows the beneﬁt of analysis 258 of a real network representing connectivity between people and the places that they frequent , in order to 259 allow detailed understanding of transmission dynamics which can inform public health interventions . 260 Author contributions WW and RME designed and WW implemented the mathematical model .

The remaining 28 households were chosen from a list with at least one conﬁrmed or suspected 279 COVID - 19 case in the household ( “enriched households” ) . The survey methodology is described in detail 280 in our original paper on the descriptive epidemiology of this community ( 27 ) . We asked each household 281 survey respondent about the membership and composition of their household : which individuals are part 282 of it and their basic demographic details , and about the schools , places of worship , ritual baths ( men only ) 283 that each household member attended . 284 We conducted a serological survey for IgG antibodies with aﬃnity to trimeric spike , receptor binding 285 domain and nucleocapsid protein targets from individuals in 309 households of which 24 were in the 286 enriched group , and deﬁned a cut - oﬀ value for seropositivity . The seropositivity in this population , 64 . 3 % 287 ( 95 % CI 61 . 6 - 67 . 0 % ) in total , and 74 % ( 70 - 77 . 6 % ) in adults was greater than estimates for the surrounding 288 metropolitan area at that time , estimated to be 10 . 8 % ( 9 . 3 - 12 . 5 % ) by the ONS38 . There is some censoring 289 in the serosurvey : not every individual surveyed provided a blood sample , and the distribution of censorship 290 for diﬀerent household sizes is shown in Figure S2 . We excluded serology from the enriched subset of 291 households . 292 4 . 2 Network generation 293 We used the information from the household survey to construct a bipartite network as substrate for a 294 transmission model . Vertices or nodes in the network are partitioned into two groups representing people 295 and places . Places furthermore have a label indicating their kind : primary or secondary school , place 296 of worship , ritual bath , or household . The distinction between primary and secondary school is imputed 297 based on age with a culturally - appropriate division at 13 years of age . There is an undirected edge joining 298 a person and a place if that person has reported an association with that place in the survey . If a person 299 is a member of a household , then they have an edge connecting them to that household . If they go to 300 a particular school , they have an edge connecting them to that school . Person nodes are additionally 301 annotated with age and sex as well as lifecycle stage ( pre - school , primary school , secondary school and 302 adult ) . 303 4 . 3 Transmission model 304 We used a susceptible - exposed - infectious - removed ( SEIR ) model for SARS - CoV - 2 transmission formulated 305 as a stochastic graph rewriting system ( 45 ) . Dynamic simulation of this class of rewriting system is done 306 with Gillespie’s algorithm with propensities for a rule given by the number of embeddings of its left - hand 307 side in the underlying graph and its rate constant . This formulation allows us a reﬁned representation of 308 transmission dynamics with two classes of rewriting rule for transmission . The ﬁrst class is place - mediated 309 transmission where transmission is from a place to an individual connected to that place . It is expressed 310 with rules of the form , 311 S L i βι ( L i ) E L i ( 1 ) where the left - hand side of the rule is understood as a pattern to match in the underlying graph . The 312 result of matching these patterns is a set of embeddings . The right - hand side is the replacement for a 313 given embedding . The pattern contains an edge between the individual and a speciﬁc place L i for this 314 explicitly place - mediated transmission process . The individual is in the susceptible state , S , and becomes 315 exposed indicated with the label E . The transmission rate in a place is proportional to the fraction , ι ( L i ) 316 8 .

This follows standard mass - action kinetics assuming that 317 within - place interactions are well - mixed . We ﬁt a rate constant , β , particular to each kind of place . 318 Reporting of places of each type was by characteristic demographic groups and therefore we did not need 319 explicit demographic stratiﬁcation - diﬀering degrees of contact between demographic groups is implicit in 320 the network topology itself and are a feature of the type of place and not of particular pairs of groups . 321 The second class of transmission rule occurs directly between individuals , 322 S I β E / N E I ( 2 ) Here , the left - hand side of the rule matches any pair of individuals with the indicated disease progression 323 states regardless of the network connectivity . There are ﬁve such well - mixed rules ( Equations S13 and 324 S14 ) to represent transmission at random within the community . The ﬁrst four represent infection by 325 lifecycle stage . This reﬂects lower susceptibility of children which we found was necessary to reproduce 326 the probabilities of positive test results by age ( Figure 2 D ) comparable to the empirical data and as has 327 been reported elsewhere ( 34 ) . We take the mean estimate of 50 % lower susceptibility of children32 and 328 interpolate step - wise , assuming that pre - school children are 25 % , primary school 50 % , secondary school 329 75 % as susceptible to infection as adults . The ﬁfth is a mechanism for additional infection of adult women 330 in order to compensate for lack of explicit information about the places that they frequent . 331 The complete model is given in the technical supplement both schematically ( Section A ) and in code 332 ( Section F ) . 333 4 . 4 Estimating transmission rate parameters 334 We ﬁt the six transmission rate parameters to the distribution of positive serological tests in the subset 335 of households that are randomly chosen . These would correspond to household attack rate distributions 336 were there no censoring . In the presence of censoring , these distributions underestimate the attack rate 337 because there is a non - zero probability that individuals who have been infected have not participated in 338 the serological survey . We compare the distribution of simulated censored positive cases to the data using 339 the Wasserstein metric ( 47 , 48 ) which is designed to provide a well - deﬁned distance between probability 340 distributions . The measure for evaluating goodness of ﬁt is the sum of the distances between distributions 341 for each household size . To calibrate the well - mixed process introduced to compensate for the lack of 342 information about the places frequented by adult women , we augment the ﬁtting measure with a penalty 343 term for asymmetric rates of infection between men and women in the population . 344 We inferred the transmission rate parameters using the sequential Monte - Carlo method of approximate 345 Bayesian computation ( ABC - SMC ) starting with 10 % of randomly chosen individuals in the infectious 346 state . For eﬃciency , we ﬁt in two stages . First , we used a uniform prior distribution on all transmission 347 parameters for 10 generations consisting of a total of 2 × 10 5 samples with an acceptance rate of 512 348 particles per generation to obtain a coarse estimate . Then , for 6 further generations with a total of 3 × 10 5 349 samples also with an acceptance rate of 512 particles per generation , we used a prior normally distributed 350 about the mean obtained from the ﬁrst step , with standard deviation of 10 % . The resulting kernel density 351 estimates are provided in Supplementary ﬁgures 3 and 4 . 352 4 . 5 Simulation 353 We present results from 1024 simulated epidemics with parameters randomly drawn from the ﬁtted pos - 354 terior distribution . As with ﬁtting , 10 % of individuals are randomly selected to be infectious at the start , 355 and epidemics run for 90 days . 356 9 .

For 360 example , if the 95th percentile of primary schools is used as the threshold , the largest primary school with 361 103 edges would become two primary schools with 51 and 52 edges each . We did this , holding all else the 362 same , in 10 percentile increments from the 90th to the 10th percentile separately for both primary schools 363 and places of worship . 364 4 . 7 Sensitivity to population size 365 The data , understood as a bipartite network , are asymmetric in the following sense . One partition , con - 366 taining places , is complete meaning that all schools , places of worship & c are represented in the data . The 367 partition containing individuals , however , is incomplete ; only about 10 % of the population was sampled . 368 Furthermore , the total sizes of most places is not known . This asymmetry means that special attention 369 is required to the sensitivity of the results from a place - mediated transmission model on absolute popu - 370 lation size . We address this by varying the size of the population . To decrease the population , we select 371 households uniformly at random without replacement to remove , and remove those individuals who are 372 members of the selected households . To increase the population , we select households uniformly at random 373 with replacement and , for each , create a duplicate household whose members are connected to the same 374 places as the role - model . This sensitivity analysis is then to simulate epidemics on these smaller or larger 375 networks and check that the results hold . 376 4 . 8 Code and data availability 377 The simulator for the extended version of the κ - calculus that we use here is implemented as part of 378 the NetABC package ( https : / / git . sr . ht / ~ wwaites / netabc ) .

A . Illustrative represen - tation of a bipartite people and places network . Circles represent people and squares represent places . All people are connected to a household ( H ) . Some people are connected to primary ( P ) or secondary ( S ) schools , places of worship ( G ) or ritual baths ( M ) . The orange dotted , and red solid edges represent embed - dings of a transmission rule ( Equation 6 ) capturing the situation immediately before a transmission event that will result in the individual p14 becoming infected . B . The distribution of the fraction of individuals in each setting who were male . Households were mixed , but the attendees of both primary and secondary schools were strongly bimodal : either predominantly male or predominantly female . Attendance at places of worship and ritual baths was predominantly reported by males . Overall , the community was balanced to within a few percent . C . The distribution of average ages in the various settings ( for the community in general , this is simply the age distribution of individuals ) . Note that attendance at primary school is disjoint with attendance at secondary schools , and attendance at schools was mostly disjoint with places of worship or ritual baths . 16 .
