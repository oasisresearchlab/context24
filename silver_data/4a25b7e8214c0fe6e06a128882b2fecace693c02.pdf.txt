To address this gap , we created scenes of toy photographers taking pictures of layouts of objects from different angles , and presented them to 4 - to 8 - year - olds ( N = 80 ) . Children were asked to choose which one of four pictures could have been taken from a speciﬁc viewpoint . Results showed that this new technique conﬁrmed the classic pattern of developmental progress on this kind of spatial skill : ( 1 ) 4 - year - olds responded near chance level , regardless of layout complexity , ( 2 ) there was a growing ability to inhibit egocentric choices around age 6 with layouts of low complexity ( one object ) , ( 3 ) performance increased and egocentric responses decreased dramatically around age 7 , ( 4 ) even at age 8 , children still showed considerable individual variability . This perspective taking task can thus be used to address important questions about the supports for early spatial development and the structure of early intellect . Keywords : cognitive development , spatial cognition , perspective taking , child , viewpoint , reference frame INTRODUCTION Visual perspective taking , or the ability to mentally represent a viewpoint different from one’s own , has been extensively studied in the developmental literature , beginning with Piaget and Inhelder’s ( 1956 ) seminal work on The child’s conception of space . In their Three Mountains Task , Piaget and Inhelder asked children to look at a model display of three mountains and to indicate how an observer would see this layout from another position . Up to the age of 9 or 10 years , children made many errors on this task and often picked their own view instead of the observer’s view , thus committing egocen - tric errors . Piaget and Inhelder argued that young children were unable to coordinate multiple perspectives and they interpreted these difﬁculties as being indicative of a lack of understand - ing of what they called projective space . This work inspired hundreds of studies , many of which focused on demonstrat - ing success earlier than 9 or 10 years ( see review by Newcombe , 1989 ) . One important distinction in understanding the development of perspective taking was proposed by Flavell et al . ( 1981 ) and Masangkayet al . ( 1974 ) . Theseresearcherspointedoutthatknowl - edge about which objects are visible at all from another viewpoint appears quite early in life . They called this type of non - egocentric inference Level 1 knowledge . Thus , a child at Level 1 knows that another person may currently see an object that is not visible for the child , or vice versa . However , computing exactly how the other person perceives things is not possible until Level 2 . In support of this distinction , recent studies have demonstrated Level 1 abilities even in infancy ( Moll and Tomasello , 2006 ; Sodian et al . , 2007 ) . In contrast , Level 2 rules are ﬁrst evident at around 4 or 5 years of age ( Masangkay et al . , 1974 ; Flavell et al . , 1980 ; Pillow and Flavell , 1986 ) but performance improves considerably between age 6 and 8 ( Salatas and Flavell , 1976 ) . Despite a large body of research on perspective taking , our knowledge of the individual and task factors affecting the emer - genceof Level2perspectivetakingisstillverylimited . Onerelevant factor was suggested by Fishbein et al . ( 1972 ) , who found that chil - dren from 3 – 9 years performed better in picture selection tasks if only one object was involved , compared to when an array of three objects was presented ( see also Gzesh and Surber , 1985 ) . Tasks with only one object may be spatially less complex as no array - internal relations have to be encoded and coordinated with the position ( or line of sight ) of the observer . Consistent with this notion , Ives ( 1980 ) found that responses of children as young as 3 years old were about 90 % correct if they were asked whether they would see the front , side , or back of a single fronted object ( e . g . , a horse ) from a speciﬁed position . However , several other studies with children from kindergarten to 6th grade have failed to ﬁnd an effect of number of objects in the array ( Brodzinsky et al . , 1972 ; Minnigerode and Carey , 1974 ; Nigl and Fishbein , 1974 ) . Another important factor affecting the emergence of perspec - tive taking lies in the nature of the dependent variable and whether it requires the suppression of conﬂicting frames of reference . Piaget and Inhelder ( 1956 ) used picture selection or model build - ing tasks , in which children sat within the frame of reference of a room while attempting to imagine an array from a different vantage point . Huttenlocher and Presson ( 1973 , 1979 ) found that 8 - or 9 - year - olds did much better when asked about particular items from a different vantage point ( e . g . , if you sat over there , what would be closest to you ? ) , and argued that such questions were easier because they suggested a frame of reference other than the surrounding room ( i . e . , the child’s body in an imagined www . frontiersin . org April 2014 | Volume 5 | Article 386 | 1 Konstanzer Online - Publikations - System ( KOPS ) URL : http : / / nbn - resolving . de / urn : nbn : de : bsz : 352 - 2 - 9ausg3nwdjne4 Erschienen in : Frontiers in psychology ; 5 ( 2017 ) . - 386 https : / / doi . org / 10 . 3389 / fpsyg . 2014 . 00386 Frick etal . Development of perspective taking position served as the reference point ) . Even preschoolers suc - ceed on tasks in which responses are not inﬂuenced by conﬂicting frames of reference ( Newcombe and Huttenlocher , 1992 ) . Impor - tantly , however , such questions are not easier in general ; they are harder when children are asked to imagine the array rotating ( Huttenlocher and Presson , 1973 , 1979 ) . The contrast between array rotation and perspective taking and its interaction with the processing demands of the dependent variable have been con - ﬁrmed in many subsequent studies ( Simons and Wang , 1998 ; Wang and Simons , 1999 ; Wraga et al . , 2000 ; Hegarty and Waller , 2004 ; Nardini et al . , 2006 ) . Taken together , a great deal of research tells us that , on tasks that minimize spatial and representational complexity , the basic abil - ity to take someone else’s perspective is present from infancy , and may provide the foundation for social cognitive abilities , such as theory of mind ( Sodian et al . , 2007 ) . However , from a spatial cog - nition point of view , the spatially rich Level 2 perspective - taking tasks with conﬂicting frames of reference are interesting because they concern the ability to represent and coordinate multiple per - spectives in one coherent spatial framework . This ability may be ecologically meaningful and predictive of real - world spatial per - formance , as suggested by research in adults ( Hegarty and Waller , 2004 , 2005 ) . For example , Hegarty and Waller ( 2004 ) found that perspective taking was correlated with participants’ self - reported sense of direction , which in turn had predictive validity as a mea - sure of spatial cognition in large - scale environments ( Sholl , 1988 ; Hegarty et al . , 2002 ) . One of the very few developmental studies showed that perspective taking ( measured by a modiﬁed Three Mountains Task ) correlated with performance in a mapping task ( Liben and Downs , 1993 ) . One reason why individual differences in Level 2 perspec - tive taking and their correlates are little investigated in chil - dren may be that there is no simple and easy - to - administer test of the ability . Many existing paradigms were not applied below age 6 ( Brodzinsky et al . , 1972 ; Liben and Downs , 1993 ; Surtees and Apperly , 2012 ) . The ones that are suitable for younger children require complex setups involving farm scenes , toy houses , dolls , toy boats , blocks , or papier - mâché moun - tains , ( Coie et al . , 1973 ; Minnigerode and Carey , 1974 ; Ives , 1980 ; Liben and Belknap , 1981 ; Brodzinsky , 1982 ; Gzesh and Surber , 1985 ) . Such three - dimensional setups are hard to repro - duce in replication studies and cumbersome to haul to schools in large - scale studies . Furthermore , some of the previous tasks required children to understand or even produce com - plex spatial terms in describing how displays looked to them ( e . g . , “right side up” ) or other observers ( “upside down” ; e . g . , Masangkay et al . , 1974 ) . In the present study , we thus investigated the development of Level 2 perspective taking in children from 4 – 8 years , using a task similar to the original Three Mountains Task in terms of spatial and representational complexity . However , in the present task , spatial layouts were presented on paper , which made the task easier to administer than using a three - dimensional display or model . The general format of the present task was based on a study with adult participants ( Hegarty and Waller , 2004 ) . In this task , computer graphics showed three photographers taking pictures of a complex three - dimensional layout of objects . Different pictures of the layout were presented and adults were asked to decide which of the photographers ( or none ) could have taken the picture . As this task was hard even for adults , a simpliﬁed version was created for the age groups of the present study . We presented scenes with toy photographers taking pictures of different layouts of objects and asked children to choose which one of four pictures was most likely taken by a speciﬁc photographer . Most notably , our task differed from Hegarty and Waller’s in that we used photographs of Playmobil ﬁgures rather than computer graphics , and the choice alternatives showed perspectives that were easier to differentiate as they differed by larger angles ( 90 ◦ ) . Children from 4 – 8 years were tested , based on previous work showing that Level 2 knowledge emerges around 4 or 5 years of age ( Masangkay et al . , 1974 ; Flavell et al . , 1980 ; Pillow and Flavell , 1986 ) , and improves considerably between age 6 and 8 ( Salatas and Flavell , 1976 ) . We investigated Level 2 perspective taking abil - ities in this age range using a single methodology , and also tested effects of different angular disparities between observer and tar - get perspectives . Given that previous studies led to mixed results about effects of spatial complexity of presented layouts , we also systematically examined effects of layout complexity . We expected performance to be highest on trials presenting only one fronted object , lower performance if two symmetrical objects were pre - sented and the viewpoint had to be inferred based on their spatial relation , and the lowest performance if arrays of multiple objects were presented for which internal spatial conﬁgurations had to be considered . MATERIALS AND METHODS PARTICIPANTS Participants were 80 children , with 16 children ( 8 boys and 8 girls ) in each of the following age groups : 4 - year - olds ( mean age = 4 ; 4 , range = 4 ; 0 – 4 ; 11 ) ; 5 - year - olds ( mean age = 5 ; 6 , range = 5 ; 1 – 5 ; 11 ) ; 6 - year - olds ( mean age = 6 ; 4 , range = 6 ; 0 – 6 ; 11 ) ; 7 - year - olds ( mean age = 7 ; 6 , range = 7 ; 1 – 7 ; 11 ) ; 8 - year - olds ( mean age = 8 ; 7 , range = 8 ; 1 – 9 ; 0 ) . Two additional children ( one 4 - and one 5 - year - old ) were tested but excluded from analyses due to incorrect responses on one of the three criterion trials ( see next section ) . Children were recruited from a database of families who had volunteered to participate in developmental research . They were predominantly Caucasian , from middle - class backgrounds , and lived in urban and suburban areas of a large U . S . city . All par - ents provided written informed consent and all children provided verbal assent . All procedures used in this research were conducted according to ethical guidelines and approved by the Institutional Review Board at Temple University . STIMULUS MATERIAL AND PROCEDURE Participants were tested in a laboratory room . In four instruc - tion trials , real three - dimensional objects and photographers were presented ( Figure 1 ) . A cone and a cylinder were presented side - by - side on a letter - size white cardboard and placed on a table . Two Playmobil ﬁgures were placed on the cardboard and introduced as Lisa and Peter . Both ﬁgures were holding a camera , pointing it at the objects , one at 90 ◦ and one at 180 ◦ angular difference to the child’s line of sight . In each of the four practice trials , a pic - ture of the cone and cylinder was presented that was taken from Frontiers in Psychology | Developmental Psychology April 2014 | Volume 5 | Article 386 | 2 Frick etal . Development of perspective taking FIGURE 1 | Schematic of the layout and stimuli presented in the instruction phase . The symbolic eye indicates the children’s viewing position . a different perspective . Children were asked whether they thought that Lisa or Peter ( or no one ) has taken the picture . After the chil - dren gave their responses ( verbally ) , the experimenter encouraged them to walk behind Lisa and Peter and peek over their shoul - ders to check . One picture showed the child’s own perspective so neither of the photographers could have taken it . In this case , the experimenter encouraged the child to return to its seat after check - ing , and pointed out that neither Lisa nor Peter could have taken this picture because it was taken from where the child was sitting . A three - dimensional setup was chosen for the instruction trials , as pilot experiments showed that young children had difﬁ - culties understanding the instructions if they were not allowed to physically move behind the photographers to check their answers . Furthermore , a setup with two photographers was used in instruction trials ( in analogy to the original task by Hegarty and Waller , 2004 ) , to highlight the fact that different positions of photographers afford different perspectives . Moreover , previ - ous work had shown that children are more likely to understand the task if a doll was used in the instruction ( Newcombe and Huttenlocher , 1992 ) . Subsequent trials were presented as color printouts in letter - sized transparent document pockets in a binder . The ﬁrst two trials served to ease the transition from the three - dimensional instruc - tion trials . These trials showed two photographers at 0 , 90 , or 180 ◦ angular difference from the child’s perspective , and children had to guess which photographer could have taken one particular pic - ture . Thenextthreetrialsshowedonlyonephotographerwithfour alternative pictures , and children were asked which picture this photographer could have taken . These three trials served as crite - rion trials and were very easy , as the four alternatives each showed completely different objects , only one of which was in front of the photographer’s camera . Thus , following the photographer’s line of sight ( or Level I perspective taking ) was sufﬁcient to succeed on these trials . The subsequent test trials presented one photographer and four choice alternatives , but now all alternatives showed the same object ( s ) from different perspectives ( see Figure 2 ) . The choice alternatives were distributed horizontally below the layout pic - ture . One of the alternatives showed the correct view and three were foils , in which the orientation or spatial relations among the objects would not match the photographer’s perspective . Whereas on 0 ◦ trials the child’s own perspective was the correct answer , on 90 and 180 ◦ trials the child’s perspective served as one of the foils . The layouts consisted of one , two , or four objects . To clearly distinguish the views on one - object trials , a fronted asymmetric object was used : a ﬁgurine with a face , a bag over one shoulder , and one arm raised . On four - object trials , roughly half of the foils also differed regarding the internal spatial relations between objects . All layout pictures were taken from an oblique angle ( camera slanted by ca . 45 ◦ ) , similar to how a layout on the table would look from the child’s eye level ( e . g . , in instruction trials ) . Thus , all objects in the array were clearly visible and none of them was occluded . The choice pictures were taken from a slightly lower camera position , so that the 0 ◦ choice alternative was similar but not identical to the layout picture ( and the child’s perspective ) . Children were instructed to “point to the picture Lisa ( Peter ) has taken from where she ( he ) is standing . ” Children were also encouraged to “pretend peeking over her ( his ) shoulder to ﬁnd out . ” If a child pointed ambiguously , the experimenter asked the child to point again because she did not clearly see which one the child had chosen . If a child pointed to two pictures in a row the child was asked again which one was the ﬁnal answer . The experimenter wrote down the response and ﬂipped the page for the next trial . There was no time limit to complete a trial and the whole experiment took about 5 to 7 min . DESIGN Test trials varied in the angular difference between the photographer’s and the child’s perspectives ( 0 , 90 , or 180 ◦ ) and complexity ( 1 , 2 , or 4 objects in the layout ) . Each of these combi - nations was presented twice , with different objects and a different photographer , amounting to a total of 18 test trials . The num - ber of objects in the layout was blocked , such that complexity increased from block to block . However , half of the children of each age group and sex were presented with the reverse trial order , such that complexity decreased from block to block , in order to rule out confounding effects of fatigue or practice . The different angles were presented in a predetermined quasi - random order , with the restriction that no angle was presented twice in a row . Photographers ( Lisa or Peter ) and objects ( colors , spatial conﬁgu - rations ) were also changed between trials , in order to make the task more entertaining and prevent children from trying to remember their answers in previous trials . The position of the correct choice was quasi - randomized across trials . A trial was scored with one point if the correct picture was selected , and with zero points if any of the three foils were chosen , thus a total score of 18 could be reached . RESULTS INTERNAL CONSISTENCY We calculated Guttman’s split - half coefﬁcient ( i . e . , the correla - tion between trials analogous in terms of angle and complexity , www . frontiersin . org April 2014 | Volume 5 | Article 386 | 3 Frick etal . Development of perspective taking FIGURE 2 | Examples for stimuli presented in test trials , varying in spatial complexity ( 1 , 2 , or 4 objects ) and perspectives ( 90 , 0 , or 180 ◦ ) . Stimuli were presented exactly as shown , as color printouts on separate letter - sized sheets of paper . but with different objects and photographers ) , which showed an excellent internal consistency of 0 . 91 . ABOVE CHANCE PERFORMANCE In a ﬁrst analysis , performance was classiﬁed according to whether or not it exceeded chance , that is , whether children solved 9 trials or more out of 18 trails correctly ( Binomial distribution , p < 0 . 05 ) . The number of children who performed above chance increased with age , with signiﬁcant improvements from 5 to 6 and from 7 to 8 years of age ( see Table 1 , ﬁrst column ; asterisks indicate signiﬁ - cant chi - square statistics showing more above - chance performing children than in the previous age group ) . MEAN ACCURACY To test for effects of spatial complexity and angular difference between the photographer’s and the child’s perspectives on the proportion of correctly solved trials , data were averaged across measurement repetitions . A preliminary ANOVA was calculated with angle ( 0 , 90 , 180 ◦ ) , complexity ( 1 , 2 , 4 objects ) , age group ( 5 ) , sex ( 2 ) , and trial order ( forward vs . backward ) as independent variables , and accuracy as dependent variable . The analysis showed no signiﬁcant main effects of or inter - actions with trial order ( all F s < 2 . 02 , all p s > 0 . 05 ) . This suggests that there were no signiﬁcant effects due to practice or fatigue ; therefore this variable was not included in subsequent analyses . An ANOVA was calculated with angle ( 0 , 90 , 180 ◦ ) , complexity ( 1 , 2 , 4objects ) , agegroup ( 5 ) , andsex ( 2 ) asindependentvariables and accuracy as dependent variable . Results showed signiﬁcant main effects of age group , F ( 4 , 70 ) = 16 . 04 , p < 0 . 001 , η 2 = 0 . 48 . Post hoc tests ( Sidak corrected here , and throughout ) showed that there was a dramatic increase in correct choices especially between 7 and 8 years of age ( from 51 to 76 % , p < 0 . 001 , see Table 1 ) . The group of 8 - year - olds differed from all other age groups ( all p s < 0 . 001 ) , whereas age groups younger than 8 years did not differ from each other ( all p s > 0 . 08 ) . However , even at age 8 , there was still considerable variability in individual test scores ( see Table 1 for standard deviations ) .

Frontiers in Psychology | Developmental Psychology April 2014 | Volume 5 | Article 386 | 4 Frick etal . Development of perspective taking Furthermore , there was a signiﬁcant main effect of angle , F ( 2 , 140 ) = 191 . 24 , p < 0 . 001 , η 2 = 0 . 73 , and an interac - tion of age group and angle , F ( 8 , 140 ) = 4 . 56 , p < 0 . 001 , η 2 = 0 . 21 . Post hoc tests investigating this interaction showed that 4 - year - olds differed from all other age groups on 0 ◦ tri - als ( all p s < 0 . 01 ) . On the other hand , 8 - year - olds differed from all other age groups on 90 and 180 ◦ trials ( all p s < 0 . 05 ) . Other age groups did not differ signiﬁcantly at any angle ( all p s > 0 . 44 ) . An interaction between sex and angle , F ( 2 , 140 ) = 4 . 76 , p < 0 . 05 , η 2 = 0 . 06 , was due to males outperforming females on 0 ◦ trials that did not require a perspective change ( p < 0 . 05 ) , whereas on 90 and 180 ◦ trials there were no sex differences ( p s > 0 . 11 ) . A main effect of complexity , F ( 2 , 140 ) = 13 . 21 , p < 0 . 001 , η 2 = 0 . 16 , was qualiﬁed by a two - way interaction between com - plexity and angle , F ( 4 , 280 ) = 2 . 65 , p < 0 . 05 , η 2 = 0 . 04 , and a three - way interaction of complexity , angle , and age group , F ( 16 , 280 ) = 2 . 59 , p < 0 . 01 , η 2 = 0 . 13 ( see Figure 3 ) . Post hoc tests showed that complexity mattered mostly on 90 ◦ trials ( all p s < 0 . 05 ) and 180 ◦ trials ( one object signiﬁcantly better than two , p < 0 . 05 ) . On the other hand , on trials requiring no per - spective change , the number of objects did not signiﬁcantly affect accuracy ( all p s > 0 . 11 ) and performance was high overall ( 87 % accuracy ) . However , the three - way interaction with age group indicates that this was not true for 4 - year - olds , who performed better on 0 ◦ trials when only one object was involved ( 84 % accu - racy ) as compared to multiple objects ( p s < 0 . 05 ) . In addition , they performed poorly on trials that required a perspective change ( from 9 – 31 % accuracy ) regardless of complexity ( p s > 0 . 67 ) . The ANOVA showed no other signiﬁcant effects ( all F s < 1 . 09 , p s > 0 . 36 ) . EGOCENTRIC ERRORS Finally , children’s responses were analyzed regarding their ten - dency to choose the alternative showing their own perspective . Such an egocentric response is the correct solution on 0 ◦ trials , but incorrect on 90 and 180 ◦ trials . Therefore , only 90 and 180 ◦ trials were included in this analysis . An ANOVA was calculated with angle ( 90 , 180 ◦ ) , complexity ( 1 , 2 , 4 objects ) , age group ( 5 ) , and sex ( 2 ) as independent variables and proportion of egocentric responses as dependent variable . The analysis yielded signiﬁcant main effects of age group , F ( 4 , 70 ) = 5 . 80 , p < 0 . 001 , η 2 = 0 . 25 , and complexity , F ( 2 , 140 ) = 3 . 40 , p < 0 . 05 , η 2 = 0 . 05 , and a signiﬁcant inter - action between age group and complexity , F ( 8 , 140 ) = 2 . 32 , p < 0 . 05 , η 2 = 0 . 12 . Figure 4 shows that , especially when mul - tiple objects were involved , egocentric errors increased from 4 to 5 years of age , but generally decreased after 5 years of age . Post hoc tests suggested that 5 - , 6 - , and 7 - year - olds chose the egocentric view signiﬁcantly more often than 8 - year - olds when multiple objects were involved ( p s < 0 . 05 ) . However , when only one object was in the layout , 6 - and 7 - year - olds did not differ from 8 - year - olds ( p s > 0 . 13 ) . A main effect of sex , F ( 1 , 70 ) = 5 . 00 , p < 0 . 05 , η 2 = 0 . 07 , indicated that boys chose the egocentric perspective more often than girls ( 64 and 51 % , respectively ) . The ANOVA yielded no other signiﬁcant effects , ( all F s < 2 . 21 , p s > 0 . 11 ) . FIGURE 3 | Mean correct responses ( in % ) by age group and number of objects per angle . Error bars indicate the standard error of the mean . DISCUSSION In the present study , we investigated 4 - to 8 - year - old children’s ability to represent and coordinate multiple perspectives when dealing with conﬂicting frames of reference . We presented pictures showing scenes with a toy photographer taking pictures of a single fronted object or multiple objects from different angles . Children were asked to select the toy photographer’s perspective among four photographs . Results showed an increase in correct choices with age , with the most dramatic improvement between 7 and 8 years of age . The number of children who performed above chance level also increased with age , with signiﬁcant improvement from 5 to 6 and from 7 to 8 years of age . A more detailed analysis of children’s incorrect responses showed that when multiple objects were involved , egocentric errors increased from 4 to 5 years of age . In combination with the low accuracy observed in 4 - year - olds , it appears that 4 - year - olds may have responded randomly , whereas at 5 years of age www . frontiersin . org April 2014 | Volume 5 | Article 386 | 5 Frick etal . Development of perspective taking FIGURE 4 | Mean egocentric errors ( in % ) in trials requiring a perspective change , by age group and number of objects . Error bars indicate the standard error of the mean . children began to more systematically choose their own perspec - tive . Egocentric errors peaked at 5 years of age , followed by a general decrease in this response bias , suggesting a growing ability to inhibit egocentric choices and to rely on allocentric represen - tations of space with increasing age ( Lourenco and Frick , 2013 ) . Boys made more egocentric errors than girls , indicating that they chose a view that corresponded to their own perspective more often than girls . This may also explain why boys generally outper - formed females on 0 ◦ trials , where the egocentric response was the correct choice . However , there were no sex differences in accuracy on trails that required a perspective change . Even though performance improved with age , there was still considerable variability in individual test scores , as suggested by large standard deviations . Thus , although some 8 - year - olds per - formed almost perfectly , there was still room for improvement for many 8 - year - olds , especially for spatially complex layouts show - ing multiple objects . For all children except the youngest age group , spatial complexity mattered most on trials that required a perspective change , whereas performance on 0 ◦ - trials was gen - erally very high . On the other hand , spatial complexity did not affect performance on trials that did not require a perspective change – again with exception of 4 - year - olds , whose perfor - mance suffered even on 0 ◦ - trials when more than one object was involved . Layouts of low spatial complexity , exhibiting only one fronted object , appeared to be easier for 4 - year - olds , and a decrease in egocentric responses was observed about 2 years earlier on such items . These results corroborate previous ﬁndings that children succeededearlierif fewerobjectsareinvolved ( Fishbeinet al . , 1972 ; Gzesh and Surber , 1985 ) . When only one fronted object is pre - sented , success can be achieved by following an observer’s line of sight and noticing whether he would see the front , back , or a par - ticular side of the object . This may have reduced task difﬁculty , and made the task more similar to a Level 1 perspective taking task . On the other hand , if multiple objects are involved , spatial relations between the objects in the array have to be considered . Our results suggest that this ability was virtually non - existent in 4 - year - olds , and improved considerably from 7 to 8 years of age . These results are consistent with previous literature showing that Level 2 rules are acquired at around 4 or 5 years of age ( Masangkay et al . , 1974 ; Flavell et al . , 1980 ; Pillow and Flavell , 1986 ) , and improve considerably between age 6 and 8 ( Salatas and Flavell , 1976 ) . At the same time , our results stand in contrast to claims that younger children can demonstrate Level 2 perspective taking skills . For example , in a study by Liben ( 1978 ) that aimed to minimize spatial complexity , the child and / or experimenter wore colored glasses and the child was asked to describe in which color a white card appeared to each of them . At ages 6 – 7 , answers were consis - tently correct , and even at ages 4 – 5 more than half the children were able to correctly answer questions about the experimenter’s view . In similar but more recent studies , Moll et al . ( 2013 ) and Moll and Meltzoff ( 2011 ) showed that children as young as 3 years old knew how an object would look to another person if viewed through a color ﬁlter . However , it is not entirely clear whether tasks such as these are essentially Level 1 tasks , as even though they ask a how - question , tracing a line of sight shows a path that traverses the ﬁlter . These conﬂicting results also suggest the need for ﬁner - grained research on the processes underlying the different perspective tak - ing tasks . The classic perspective taking task involves arrays of multiple objects and tests with picture choice and model build - ing . This task probably indexes several different skills , which may include internal coding of the array of targets ( i . e . , rela - tive distances and positions among multiple objects forming a coherent conﬁguration ) , possibly using a common framework of landmarks or an external frame of reference . However , if such a frame of reference is used in coding the array , the challenge is suppressing awareness of the physically present frame of ref - erence when responding ( Huttenlocher and Newcombe , 1984 ; Newcombe , 1989 ) . In support of this notion , individual differ - ences in children’s perspective taking ( measured by a task similar to the Three Mountains Task ) have previously been linked to cog - nitive styles , such as reﬂection - impulsivity ( Brodzinsky , 1982 ) . Future research should take a closer look at whether and how the development of perspective taking is associated with progress in other spatial and non - spatial cognitive abilities . Taken together , the present ﬁndings showed a growing ability to inhibit egocentric choices and to recognize the correct view - point between 5 to 8 years of age , with the largest change between 7 and 8 years . Using a new paradigm that is easy to administer in school settings and allows for systematic experimental varia - tion of task factors such as layout complexity , the present study showed that an increase in accuracy and a decrease in egocentric responses can be observed earlier when spatial complexity is low . Most 4 - year - olds responded near chance level when a change in perspective was required , and large standard deviations in chil - dren’s responses suggest that there are large individual differences in this ability at an early age , which may be precursors of the individual differences found in adults ( for a review see Hegarty and Waller , 2005 ) . In light of ﬁndings that the ability to coordi - nate perspectives and reference frames bears importance to many spatial tasks in adults ( Hegarty and Waller , 2004 , 2005 ) , a deeper understanding of the origins and long - term effects of this ability is essential .
