1 Introduction The last 30 years have seen an enormous research effort devoted to studying visual search . There are a number of justifications for this focus . First , visual search provides a convenient method to study low - level perceptual processes by using a reaction time measure . Such a justification has resulted in a large number of studies that attempt to identify visual properties that can be extracted in parallel as distinct from those that require some serial - like processes ( eg Rensink and Enns 1995 ; Gilchrist et al 1997 ; Davis and Driver 1998 ) . A second justification is that visual search provides a constrained experimental paradigm in which to study a more general and ubiquitous behaviour . Indeed , many review papers in this area start with examples of everyday foraging tasks such as finding car keys or finding a book on the bookshelf ( eg see Wolfe 1994 , page 202 ) . Klein and MacInnes ( 1999 ) have recently explicitly argued that inhibition of return acts in visual search as a ‘‘foraging facilitator’’ . This second justification for carrying out visual - search experiments begs the question to what extent is visual search a good model for foraging in general ? As far as we know , no systematic study has been carried out to investigate this . The experiment reported here is a first attempt at testing this relationship . In order to test the extent to which visual search is a valid model for foraging we constructed a foraging task in which participants search for a marble hidden in a film canister in a room ( see figure 1 ) . There are a number of well - established properties of visual search . First , when search becomes more difficult , search time increases linearly with display size for both target - absent and target - present displays . In addition the target - present slope is half the target - absent slope ( Treisman and Gelade 1980 ) . In the current study , we aimed to see whether these features of visual search also characterised foraging . We were also interested in the memory mechanisms that support foraging . Gilchrist and Harvey ( 2000 ) used a visual - search paradigm and recorded eye movements to investigate memory in search . They argued that , if search was supported by a perfect memory for which locations had been visited , then participants should never return to refixate a distractor . In the current study , in an analogous manner , we measured the extent to which rechecking occurs in foraging . Is visual search really like foraging ?

The visual - search paradigm provides a controlled and easy to implement experimental situation in which to study the search process . However , little work has been carried out in humans to investigate the extent to which traditional visual - search tasks are similar to more general search or foraging . Here we report results from a task in which search involves walking around a room and leaning down to inspect individual locations . Consistent with more tradi - tional search tasks , search time increases linearly with display size , and the target - present to target - absent search slope is 1 : 2 . However , although rechecking of locations did occur , compared to more traditional search it was relatively rare , suggesting an increased role for memory . DOI : 10 . 1068 / p3249 2 Method 2 . 1 Participants There were ten participants with a mean age of 26 years ( range 22 ^ 33 years ) . All participants were right - handed and were recruited with posters placed in the Psychology Department . 2 . 2 Displays A 10 by 10 ( 3 m 6 3 m ) grid was marked on the carpeted floor of a room with map pins of the same colour as the carpet . For each trial , black film canisters with grey lids were placed at random locations on the grid . On half the trials , one of the film canisters contained a marble which could only be located by reaching down and shaking the canister . The displays also varied in the number of canisters(cid:246)there could be 4 , 12 , 20 , 28 , or 36 . Each participant carried out a total of 20 trials : 2 trials at each display size for both target - present and target - absent . Trial types were randomised in a block for each participant . 2 . 3 Procedure All participants were run individually and continuously on the 20 trials , with a between - trial interval to reset the display during which the participant was in another room . Participants were asked to search for a ball in one of the canisters , which could be identified by shaking a canister . All began the search from a point ˆ ~ ˜ metre below one side of the grid . Participants were instructed that the target would not always be present , and that the number of canisters would change across trials . Only two constraints were placed upon participants : ( i ) to be careful not to knock any of the canisters over in the process and return any they did knock over to their original positions ; and ( ii ) to use one hand only . Participants indicated when they had com - pleted their search . Each participant was recorded onto digital video and subsequently analysed . We recorded two key variables from these videos : ( i ) the search time , defined as the time from the first to last touch of canisters ; and ( ii ) rechecking frequency , defined as the number of times in a trial that a given canister was returned to .

All other participants used their right hand . 2 . 4 . 1 Search - time data . Overall search times are plotted in figure 2 . Search time increased linearly for both target - absent and target - present . For target - present the search slope , which indicates the average increase in search time per additional items , was 0 . 67 s per item ( t (cid:136) 6 : 61 , p 5 0 : 001 ) with an intercept of 1 . 25 s ( t (cid:136) 0 : 534 , ns ) . For target - absent , the search slope was 1 . 57 s per item ( t (cid:136) 11 : 4 , p 5 0 : 001 ) with an intercept of (cid:255) 0 : 98 s ( t (cid:136) 0 : 302 , ns ) . The target - present to target - absent search slope ratio was 1 : 2 : 33 . To test if the search slope ratio differed significantly from 1 : 2 we carried out a further linear regression with the target - absent search times divided by 2 . There was no effect of target - present / target - absent in this regression ( t (cid:136) 0 : 363 , ns ) , indicating that the search slope ratio did not differ significantly from 1 : 2 . 2 . 4 . 2 Rechecking data . Rechecking frequency is plotted against display size for target - absent and target - present in figure 3 . Rechecking rates were typically between 0 and 2 rechecks per trial . Overall , there was more rechecking in target - absent trials ( N (cid:136) 60 ) than in target - present trials ( N (cid:136) 11 ) . This probably reflects the overall time spent searching in these two conditions ( see figures 2 and 3 ) . The extent of rechecking also increased with display size . Compared to the number of movements made , these rechecking rates are low . For example for the largest display size ( 36 ) participants made on average 20 . 3 inspections for target - present and 35 . 3 inspections for target - absent , with an average of only 0 . 61 , 1 . 72 rechecks per trial . 3 Discussion Foraging time increased linearly with number of items and the target - present to target - absent slope ratios did not differ significantly from 1 : 2 . This is consistent with visual search . A number of authors have argued that this property of the search functions is a hallmark of serial self - terminating search in which each item is sampled in turn until the target is located ( eg Treisman and Gelade 1980 ) . However , such an interpretation is far from being noncontroversial as such functions can result from noisy parallel systems ( Humphreys and Mu«ller 1993 ) . In this foraging task , it is clear that search does occur in a serial manner . Participants can only sample one item at a time and 80 60 40 20 0 S e a r c h t i m e = s 0 10 20 30 40 Number of items Figure 2 . Search time plotted against the number of items in the display .

Is visual search really like foraging ? 1461 then move on to the next item . Serial self - terminating models of visual search also assume that once an item is sampled it is excluded from the search set . In this sense , these data do not fit the strictest of serial self - terminating models as revisits do occur . Rechecking in this foraging task was rare , suggesting an important role for memory . Memory here allows the participant to avoid locations that have been visited and facilitate search . When rechecking did occur it was systematically related to the display size . This suggests that , rather than being random , these rechecks represent the limits of the mechanisms that were determined by either the display size or search time . In a similar manner to the current study , Gilchrist and Harvey ( 2000 ) investigated refixation frequency in visual search . The closest direct comparison that can be made between the current data and the data from Gilchrist and Harvey ( 2000 ) is between the larger display size here ( 36 items ) and the fixed display size used in the saccade study ( 31 items ) . Note , first , that the overall search times are radically different : in the search task the average overall search time was 1 . 9 s for target - present and 4 . 2 s for target - absent . In contrast , in the current experiment , average search times were 29 and 56 s for target - present and target - absent , respectively . One of the fundamental proper - ties of memory systems is the drop in memory performance over time ( eg Ebbinghaus 1885 / 1913 ) . As a result , such a large increase in overall search time should reduce the efficiency of any store for visited locations . This difference in search time between the two studies also co - occurs with an increase in the number of visits or fixations that occur . In the saccade study , participants made on average 5 . 7 fixations for target - present trials and 14 . 1 for target - absent trials . In the current study , participants made on average 20 . 3 inspections for target - present and 35 . 3 inspections for target - absent . The number of locations or items that have to be retained also has an influence on memory performance ( eg Miller 1956 ) . It would appear then that memory plays a more important part in determining foraging behaviour in the current study compared to search as reported by Gilchrist and Harvey ( 2000 ) . This suggests that foraging and search differ in the extent to which they rely on memory to prevent revisits . However , this may not reflect the memory capacity of either search process , but rather the extent to which the memory capacity is exploited in any given task . The estimates of the extent and importance of memory mechanism in visual search vary widely ( eg Horowitz and Wolfe 1998 ; Klein and MacInnes 1999 ; Gilchrist and Harvey 2000 ; Shore and Klein 2000 ) . Gibson et al ( 2000 ) offered one possible resolution to this issue . They argued that the extent of memory for ‘tagging’ locations depends present absent 2 . 0 1 . 5 1 . 0 0 . 5 0 . 0 N u m b e r o f r ec h ec k s p e r t r i a l 4 12 20 28 36 Number of items Figure 3 .

The filled bars relate to target - present and the unfilled bars to target - absent . 1462 I D Gilchrist , A North , B Hood on the extent to which the benefits of tagging each location outweigh the costs of holding in memory a number of locations . Such a cost ^ benefit model may include the difficulty in returning to the previously visited locations to recheck them . In the current foraging experiment , there is a substantial cost associated with revisiting a location that has been previously inspected : the participant has to walk across the room , lean over , and shake the canister . As a result , the foraging task may be an example of a search task in which memory is important because of the cost of forgetting . The difference in revisiting frequency reported here and refixation frequency reported by Gilchrist and Harvey ( 2000 ) may not simply reflect differences in the extent of ‘tagging’ of locations . Multiple types of memory are probably important in search ( Shore and Klein 2000 ) : from remembering which items have been visited to the identity of the target . Search may also be supported by a long - term memory of a strategic route followed consistently on each trial ( for example ‘‘search left to right’’ ) . Such strategic scanning appears to be an important characteristic of eye - movement patterns in visual search ( Gilchrist et al 1999 ) and refixation frequency in search is presumably modulated by the extent to which such a mechanism is employed . Refix - ation frequency may be influenced by the extent to which each individual item is tagged and the extent to which strategic scanning occurs . This has implications for the current study , the relatively small revisiting frequencies in foraging could represent an increase in strategic scanning or an increase in the use of a memory for which individ - ual items have been inspected on any given trial . Which type of memory leads to this difference across the two types of ‘search’ is an exciting topic for further study . The present study illustrates some important similarities between search and foraging , but also highlights a difference . This difference is explained in terms of the different task demands . Further studies will be required to make a more detailed comparison between search and foraging , but the methodology developed has the potential to be an ideal testing ground for investigating whether results from visual search can genuinely provide predictions about more general foraging ( eg Klein and MacInnes 1999 ) .
