Much Ado About Aha ! : Insight Problem Solving Is Strongly Related to Working Memory Capacity and Reasoning Ability Adam Chuderski and Jan Jastrze˛bski Jagiellonian University A battery comprising 4 fluid reasoning tests as well as 13 working memory ( WM ) tasks that involved storage , recall , updating , binding , and executive control , was applied to 318 adults in order to evaluate the true relationship of reasoning ability and WM capacity ( WMC ) to insight problem solving , measured using 40 verbal , spatial , math , matchstick , and remote associates problems ( insight problems ) . WMC predicted 51 . 8 % of variance in insight problem solving and virtually explained its almost isomorphic link to reasoning ability ( 84 . 6 % of shared variance ) . The strong link between WMC and insight pertained generally to most WM tasks and insight problems , was identical for problems solved with and without reported insight , was linear throughout the ability levels , and was not mediated by age , motivation , anxiety , psychoticism , and openness to experience . In contrast to popular views on the sudden and holistic nature of insight , the solving of insight problems results primarily from typical operations carried out by the basic WM mechanisms that are responsible for the maintenance , retrieval , transformation , and control of information in the broad range of intellectual tasks ( including fluid reasoning ) . Little above and beyond WM is unique about insight . Keywords : insight problem solving , reasoning , working memory , personality Human ability to solve novel abstract problems via knowledge - lean analytical reasoning ( called reasoning ability , fluid reasoning , or fluid intelligence ) , which strongly predicts academic and profes - sional success , socioeconomic status , and even longevity ( Deary , 2012 ) , is the key component of general cognitive ability ( Holyoak , 2012 ) . Plausible theories of the structure ( Carroll , 1993 ; Cattell , 1971 ) and processes underlying analytical reasoning and problem solving ( Anderson , 2005 ; Eliasmith , 2013 ; Hummel & Holyoak , 2003 ; Johnson - Laird , 2006 ; Laird , 1929 / 2012 ; Newell & Simon , 1972 ) have been developed . Individual differences in analytical reasoning and its relationships to other psychological constructs are studied by means of valid and reliable tests , large samples , and advanced statistical methodology ( see Wilhelm & Engle , 2005 ) . The key finding is that reasoning ability is strongly related ( i . e . , shares from half to all of the variance ; Colom , Abad , Quiroga , Shih , & Flores - Mendoza , 2008 ; Kane , Hambrick , & Conway , 2005 ) with the storage capacity and control efficiency of the working memory ( WM ) system ( Cowan , 2001 ) . Simply speaking , WM briefly stores representations crucial for whatever our minds are currently working on , actively switching to new pieces of information as needed to do the work , and at the same time blocking irrelevant and distracting information ( Kane & Engle , 2002 ) . The most crucial feature of WM is its limited capacity ( WMC ) : people can simultaneously represent in WM only a few “chunks , ” such as objects , bindings between objects ( or their features ) , or relational attributes ( Cowan , 2001 ) . Although the actual nature of WMC limitation is a matter of debate , a robust finding is that substantial differences in WMC exist within the population ( Cowan , 2001 ; Kane & Engle , 2002 ; Oberauer , Farrell , Jarrold , & Lewandowsky , 2016 ) . Tasks that impose high loads on WM ( e . g . , those strongly correlating with WMC and / or strongly depleted by a parallel task ) are believed to rely on the systematic , analytical processing that requires complex representations in WM ( mental models , mappings , schemas ; see Holyoak , 2012 ; Johnson - Laird , 2006 ) . In contrast , tasks not loading on WM are believed to rely on nonanalytical processes including automatic and intuitive heuris - tics and associations ( Evans , 2010 ; Kahneman , 2011 ) . It has been proposed that one potentially important category of nonanalytical problem - solving processes ( Ohlsson , 2011 ; Wiley & Jarosz , 2012 ) , which may lead to new and valuable scientific discoveries , tech - nological inventions , and artistic masterpieces ( Finke , 1996 ; Per - kins , 1981 ; but see Beaty , Nusbaum , & Silvia , 2014 ) , are processes leading to insight —a sudden understanding of an idea or a solution resulting from seeing the problem from a completely novel per - spective ( Koffka , 1935 ; Köhler , 1947 ; Maier , 1930 ; Wertheimer , 1945 ) . One way to analyze such processes is to study the cases of great inventors and artists who came up with breakthrough solu - tions to important problems of their time ( Ohlsson , 2011 ; but see Weisberg , 2006 , 2015 ) . In laboratories , insightful problem solving is studied by means of so - called insight problems ( Batchelder & Alexander , 2012 ; Chu & MacGregor , 2011 ; Kounios & Beeman , 2014 ) . Like standard analytical problems , insight problems have one correct solution but , unlike the former and regardless of the This article was published Online First October 23 , 2017 .

This is so because such problems suggest mis - leading problem representations , yielding mental constraints that block the correct representations . To solve the problem , these initial obstacles have to be overcome and an effective representa - tion of the problem has to be developed ( its restructuring has to occur ) . Once the problem is properly restructured , the solution should be obvious and yield the phenomenological experience of insight ( Aha ! or Eureka ! ) . Indeed , some authors suggested that there is a different type of processing during solving analytical problems versus insight prob - lems ( e . g . , Metcalfe , 1986 ; Ohlsson , 2011 ) . Moreover , studies reported null or even negative correlations between reasoning / WMC and insight problem performance ( see Wiley & Jarosz , 2012 ) . Unfortunately , in contrast to analytical thinking , insight problem solving seems to lack the precise and testable theories ( Ash , Cushen , & Wiley , 2009 ; Batchelder & Alexander , 2012 ) , and only few studies have used advanced methodological tools ( e . g . , Benedek et al . , 2014 ; Chuderski , 2014 ; Nusbaum & Silvia , 2011 ) . Many studies on the relationship among insight , reasoning , and WMC included questionable assumptions ( e . g . , on what given tasks measure ) , weak methodology ( e . g . , small samples , unreliable measures ) , and problematic data analysis ( for a critical review see Chuderski & Jastrze˛bski , 2017 ) . In consequence , the comprehen - sive study of the differences and similarities between the two paradigmatic types of thinking—analytic and insightful—is still lacking . The present work was aimed at such a comprehensive test of the relationships between insight problem solving and reason - ing , with each ability measured by a solid battery of problems . We also accounted for the broad WM construct , measuring five most commonly identified functions of WM , as well as calculating its general capacity . Crucially , we tested if WMC’s contribution to insight problem solving is similar to , or different from , its contri - bution to analytical problem solving . Insight Problems Although there is no actual definition of insight problem , Batch - elder and Alexander ( 2012 ) list eight features shared by most problems used in current insight research . The description of a “good” insight problem ( 1 ) is equivocal , ( 2 ) suggests initial inter - pretations that are unlikely to lead to the correct solution , and ( 3 ) misleads a solver about the correct interpretation . When ( 4 ) such a description is ignored , the finding of the correct solution is facil - itated . The solution of a “good” insight problem ( 5 ) is quickly found when the problem is represented in the correct manner ( when the traps it posed have been overcome ) , ( 6 ) relies on common sense and general knowledge , ( 7 ) is obvious to solvers when found , and ( 8 ) is obvious to nonsolvers when revealed to them ( i . e . , it elicits a similar Aha ! experience in both cases ) . The available catalogue of so - called classical insight problems accumulated during the 20th century as researchers published newly devised problems . Dow and Mayer ( 2004 ) collected the hallmark problems , and , on the basis of their content , categorized them into verbal , spatial , and math problems . An example verbal problem is “how an archaeologist could immediately claim that his colleague lied when declaring that he had found a coin dated 21 BC . ” Solving it requires realizing that things could be dated B . C . no earlier than in the AD times . Probably the best known spatial problem is the nine - dot problem , in which dots arranged in a 3 (cid:2) 3 grid have to be connected with four straight lines drawn without lifting a pencil from the paper . An aspect of the problem that people are misled by ( Kershaw & Ohlsson , 2004 ) is that the grid suggests that the lines should fit within it ( but a maximum of eight dots can be connected in such a way ) . In fact , there is no such constraint in the description . The task is extremely difficult , as usually only a few participants find the solution without additional hints ( see MacGregor , Ormerod , & Chronicle , 2001 ; Weisberg & Alba , 1981 ) . A simple math problem can ask “The giraffes and ostriches in a zoo altogether have 30 eyes and 44 legs . How many animals are there ? ” The misleading information suggests that the difference in the number of legs between giraffes and ostriches must be used to tell the exact numbers of giraffes ( 7 ) and ostriches ( 8 ) ; this requires some mental arithmetic . In fact , the legs infor - mation may be ignored , because the question is not about the numbers of giraffes and ostriches , but about the total number of animals ; only the information about the number of eyes is needed to deduce that there are 15 animals in total ( each having two eyes ) . However , most existing insight problems involve more than one modality ( e . g . , all spatial problems have verbal instructions that can be semantically undetermined ) , so their univocal categoriza - tion is impossible . Unfortunately , several methodological and practical issues are associated with classical problems . First , they are too complex for laboratory studies : most of them yield long solution times and low accuracy . Second , such problems are highly idiosyncratic ( e . g . , obstacles they pose belong to disjoint types ; Ash et al . , 2009 ) , so a few selected problems may not generalize to the whole class of problems . Third , idiosyncrasy may negatively affect the internal consistency of tests composed from highly disparate problems . In order to attenuate the above weaknesses of classical prob - lems , several other types of insight problems were developed , such as compound remote associates ( Bowden & Jung - Beeman , 2003 ) , modeled after Mednick’s ( 1962 ) remote associates , matchstick equations ( Knöblich , Ohlsson , Haider , & Rhenius , 1999 ) , and rebus puzzles ( MacGregor & Cunningham , 2008 ) . Remote asso - ciates are triples of seemingly unrelated words for which , however , one and only one meaningful semantic associate exists ( e . g . , “cap - tain” , “hotel” , “sky” ¡ “stars” ) . A matchstick problem is an incorrect arithmetic equation including Roman numerals and arith - metic operations composed from matchsticks , which requires a nontrivial decomposition of either the numeral or the operation sign in order to make the equation correct ( e . g . , “V—I (cid:3) IX” ¡ “X—I (cid:3) IX” , “III (cid:4) III (cid:3) III” ¡ “III (cid:3) III (cid:3) III” ) . Rebus puzzles represent popular phrases or sayings by a combinations of letters , digits , and / or spatial layouts ( e . g . , “1t345” – (cid:5) “tea for two” ) . Substantial collections of such problems were published , with either norms ( Bowden & Jung - Beeman , 2003 ) or clear rules ( Knö - blich et al . , 1999 ; MacGregor & Cunnigham , 2008 ) pertaining to their restructuring requirements . Their satisfactory reliability and validity were also supported ( e . g . , Chuderski , 2014 ; Cunningham , MacGregor , Gibb , & Haar , 2009 ) . Theories of Insight Problem Solving Unlike many robust theories of analytical problem solving and reasoning ( e . g . , Anderson , 2005 ; Hummel & Holyoak , 2003 ; Johnson - Laird , 2006 ; Laird , 1929 / 2012 ) , for insight there are only T h i s do c u m e n t i s c opy r i gh t e d by t h e A m e r i ca n P s y c ho l og i ca l A ss o c i a ti on o r on e o f it s a lli e d pub li s h e r s .

The Gestalt psychologists ( e . g . , Duncker , 1945 ; Koffka , 1935 ; Köhler , 1947 ; Maier , 1930 ; Wertheimer , 1945 ) originally viewed insight as a sudden change in the problem representation due to its restructuring in response to an impasse . This line of theorizing has been revived in the eighties as the neo - Gestalt account of insight ( Ohlsson , 1984 ; Metcalfe & Wiebe , 1987 ) , including the representational change theory ( RC ; Knö - blich et al . , 1999 ; Ohlsson , 1992 ; for a related but newer redistri - bution theory , see Ohlsson , 2011 ) , which predicts that initial unsuccessful attempts to solve an insight problem are followed by the relaxation of unnecessary constraints that block access to the correct solution , as well as by a decomposition of the problem chunks into simpler pieces of information to be recomposed more adequately . The most effective insights come from holistic relax - ations and decompositions ( seeing a problem in a completely new perspective ) . In sum , theories such as RC , named “special - process view” ( Davidson , 1995 ) , claim that insight is a qualitatively dif - ferent process from analytic problem solving ( see Ohlsson , 2011 ; Wiley & Jarosz , 2012 ) . The contrasting perspective , developed within modern cognitive psychology ( Davidson & Sternberg , 1984 ; Perkins , 1981 ; Weis - berg & Alba , 1981 ) , attempts to explain insight problem solving in terms of mechanistic chains of specific , well defined ( but not necessarily easily identifiable ) mental operations , such as attention shifts , memory retrievals , and imagery . This “nothing - special” or “business - as - usual” approach treats insight as involving the same elementary processes that underlie systematic , analytic thinking . The only difference to solving analytic problems is that insight problem solving often consists of an all - or - nothing , instead of a gradual , conscious access to a solution . The best known account in this vein , the progress monitoring theory ( PM ; later renamed the criterion for satisfactory progress theory , MacGregor et al . , 2001 ) , proposes that people start solving an insight problem using general problem - solving strategies that are often useful in analytic prob - lems ( such as hill - climbing or means - ends analysis ; Newell & Simon , 1972 ) . According to the PM theory , however , such strat - egies rarely work in insight problems ( e . g . , in the nine - dot problem analyzed by MacGregor et al . ) . Solvers persevere with these un - promising strategies unless , at some point , they represent in their WM either the whole hill - climbing path or the complete subgoals sequence ( depending on the strategy adopted ) that is available to them ( i . e . , unless they are able to “look ahead” ) . When they realize that this path / sequence cannot lead them to the correct solution , they re - represent the problem and change their problem solving strategy to one that helps to solve this specific problem . Thus , the PM theory predicts that the effective solving of insight problems involves substantial loads on WM . Jones ( 2003 ) , using a car park game ( a nontrivial moving of cars in order to exit a jammed car park ) , reported eye - tracking data supporting the PM theory : when participants could look three potentially unpromising moves ahead , they reached the correct solution faster than when they looked one or two moves ahead . However , Jones suggested also that his data support the RC theory : moving the car that was key for the unblocking of the car park ( interpreted as a nonobvious insight in the game ) was directly preceded by an impasse ( indicated by prolonged fixations ) . Thus , to some extent , both theories accounted for the data ( although the PM theory accounted for most of the effects ) . Fleck and Weisberg ( 2013 ; see also Fleck & Weisberg , 2004 ) reached a similar conclusion after analyzing the verbal protocols of people solving five classical insight problems . Only a minority of participants produced protocols that matched the impasse – restructuring – insight sequence , whereas others solved problems by means of their knowledge and general problem solving heuristics ( for similar data see Danek , Wiley , & Öllinger , 2016 ; Salvi , Bricolo , Kounios , Bowden , & Beeman , 2016 ; Webb , Little , & Cropper , 2016 ) . Moreover , some people effectively restructured the problem representation with no impasse . In order to explain these results , Fleck and Weisberg ( 2004 , 2013 ) proposed a hybrid theory of problem solving using four hierarchical stages ( for a recapitulation of this theory see Weisberg , 2015 ) . Later stages are elicited only when earlier stages cannot yield a solution . First , people try to recall potential solutions from long - term memory ( solutions can match directly or by analogy ) . Second , if no solution is found after this knowledge search , a solver attempts general problem solving strategies ( heuristics ) , such as hill - climbing . Third , even if neither knowledge search nor heuristics bring a ready - to - go solution , the failure may yield some additional infor - mation about the problem ( e . g . , some kind of feedback ) that can help to restructure its representation and enable a new perspective leading to the solution . Only if neither recall , nor heuristics , nor restructuring succeeds in bringing the solution does the classical impasse occur . As a result , at the fourth and final stage the solver may approach the problem description and available data once again , potentially reencoding them as well as relaxing unnecessary constraints , and this time may be able to restructure the problem successfully . Thus , the solution of insight problems is driven by the interaction of various analytical processes . What some scholars take as “insight , ” may just be a “restart” of this interaction after an impasse . Overall , relatively little progress has been made so far in devel - oping theory of insight problem solving , as compared with ana - lytical problem solving ( see Batchelder & Alexander , 2012 ) . The Fleck and Weisberg ( 2013 ) proposal is possibly the most compre - hensive , but the empirical tests of all existing theories are scarce ( e . g . , Danek et al . , 2016 ; Fleck & Weisberg , 2004 , 2013 ; Jones , 2003 ; Knoblich et al . , 1999 ; Lung & Dominowski , 1985 ; MacGregor et al . , 2001 ; Salvi et al . , 2016 ; Weisberg & Alba , 1981 ) . Thus , it may be fruitful to compare performance on insight problems to performance on WM and reasoning tasks , because the two latter domains have acquired deep theoretical explanations ( e . g . , Anderson , 2005 ; Cowan , 2001 ; Johnson - Laird , 2006 ; Ober - auer , 2016 ; Hummel & Holyoak , 2003 ) . Knowledge of relation - ships between insight , WM and reasoning may allow the transfer of some of these explanations into the insight problem solving domain . The Psychometric Approach to Insight and Its Relation to Fluid Reasoning and Working Memory In the psychometric approach to insight , participants take a test involving insight problem solving , and another test capturing some form of analytical thinking . The correlation between these tests reflects the amount of commonality between both types of think - ing . The special - process approach expects weak correlations ; the T h i s do c u m e n t i s c opy r i gh t e d by t h e A m e r i ca n P s y c ho l og i ca l A ss o c i a ti on o r on e o f it s a lli e d pub li s h e r s .

Several studies have correlated a single fluid reasoning test with a com - posite insight score , and have reported positive correlations rang - ing from r (cid:3) . 41 ( Gilhooly & Murphy , 2005 ) to r (cid:3) . 65 ( David - son , 1995 ) . However , psychometricians acknowledge ( Wittmann , 1988 ) that single tasks contaminate wanted variance in a certain ability with unwanted method - and task - specific variance , and can only partly measure this ability . One should apply at least two ( ideally three or four ) superficially differing tests designed to assess this ability in different ways . Variance shared among all these tests ( called a latent variable ) will filter specific factors out , and will thus more closely represent true ability . Latent variables can be correlated using confirmatory factor analysis ( CFA ) , or regressed in structural equation modeling ( SEM ; see Kline , 1998 ) . Such a method has been the gold standard of investigating WMC and its correlates for more than 15 years ( e . g . , Engle et al . , 1999 ) . The CFA / SEM approach must assume that general insight prob - lem solving ability ( reflected by the latent variable ) really exists ; that is , scores on various insight tests correlate more strongly mutually than with other measures . The first attempt ( Cinan , Özen , & Hampshire , 2013 ) to identify such a factor failed , as the CFA model including the insight factor ( loading on the remote associate and classical insight problems ) and the ( noninsight ) planning fac - tor showed a worse fit than the one - factor model that assumed insight and planning to be one and the same ability ( both variables correlated at r (cid:3) 1 . 0 ) . However , Chuderski ( 2014 ) succeeded in demonstrating an insight factor ( on which the verbal and figural classical insight tasks loaded in one study , and additionally the remote associates test loaded on it in another study ) that was statistically distinguishable from the reasoning factor ( i . e . , the two - factor model fit best ) , even though the factors strongly corre - lated ( r (cid:6) . 8 ) . Thus , various insight tasks seem to show convergent validity . However , fluid reasoning tests are themselves complex , and the strong link between performance on them and performance on insight problems might result from the shared complexity and requirements of both types of tasks . In order to avoid possible confounds , several studies examined relation of insight with WM , instead of reasoning , because the WM tasks involve rules of relatively low complexity , and usually involve processing , main - tenance , and later recall / recognition of very simple stimuli ( single letters , digits , figures , etc . ) . The extent to which insight problem solving and fluid reasoning differ / agree in their reliance on WM will help us to know not only conceptual but also processual differences / agreements between them . So far , highly inconsistent results have been reported , from moderately positive ( e . g . , Chuderski , 2014 ) , through null ( Ash & Wiley , 2006 ) , to even negative effects of WMC on insight problem solving ( DeCaro , Van Stockum , & Wieth , 2016 ) . Significant pos - itive correlations , varying greatly in strength , were reported be - tween WMC and insight problem solving performance ( e . g . , Chein , Weisberg , Streeter , & Kwok , 2010 ; Chuderski , 2014 ; Chuderski & Jastrze˛bski , 2017 ; De - Young , Flanders , & Peterson , 2008 ; Gilhooly & Murphy , 2005 ) as well as remote associates performance ( e . g . , Chein & Weisberg , 2014 ; De Dreu , Nijstad , Baas , Wolsink , & Roskes , 2012 ; Kane et al . , 2004 ; Storm & Angello , 2010 ) . In contrast , Wiley and Jarosz ( 2012 ) reviewed evidence on null or even negative correlations between WMC and various insight tasks , suggesting that overefficient WM may harm insight problem solving . However , a closer look ( Chuderski & Jastrze˛bski , 2017 ) at these studies ( e . g . , Ash & Wiley , 2006 ; DeCaro et al . , 2016 ; Ricks , Turley - Ames , & Wiley , 2007 ; Van Stockum & DeCaro , 2014 ) suggests that most of them examined too small samples , or reported too weak effects , to be able to support the hypothesis of the null / negative WMC - insight link . Goals of the Present Study To date no WM - insight study has examined more than one category of insight problems , with the risk that the observed results strongly depended on the peculiarities of the selected problems instead of reflecting broad insight problem solving ability ( a prob - able reason why the results varied so much from study to study ) . Furthermore , no study has examined substantially more than 100 participants ; that is , the sample sizes were greatly below the widely adopted standards for correlational studies ( at least 200 people or more , see Kline , 1998 ) . Thus , a comprehensive , large - sample study was necessary for a valid and reliable evaluation of the relationship of insight problem solving performance to both the specific functions of WM and its general capacity ( WMC ) , when controlling for reasoning ability , personality , anxiety , motivation , and age . Our general goal consisted of carrying out such a comprehen - sive psychometric test of the relationship between WMC and insight problem solving ability ( henceforth , insight ability ) , with both constructs defined at the latent level . Furthermore , we not only used objective measures of performance on the insight tasks , but also subjective reports on whether or not a person experienced insight during problem solving . The WMC - insight ability relation - ship was compared with the relationship between WMC and reasoning ability , in order to test whether or not insightful and analytical thinking differed in their WM mechanisms . No study to date has investigated the link between WM and insight problem solving in such a comprehensive way . We attempted to meet our general aim by employing five specific analyses discussed below . Links Between Specific WM Functions and Insight Problem Solving Ability The literature on WM suggests that its several specific functions may be distinguished as follows : a . active maintenance of information , often termed the short - term memory ( STM ) , primary memory , or storage function of WM , usually examined with simple span and change - detection tasks ( Cowan , 2001 ) ; b . storage during processing ( the need to maintain informa - tion in face of a distracting task ) , measured by the com - plex span tasks that interleave stimuli encoding with simple decisions ( Kane & Engle , 2002 ) ; c . updating ( frequent exchange of outdated pieces of infor - mation with those that become task relevant ) , assessed by tasks such as n - back , mental counters , and running mem - ory ( Smith & Jonides , 1999 ) ; d . executive control ( focusing on a task goal while block - ing / inhibiting the interference / distraction / habitual re - T h i s do c u m e n t i s c opy r i gh t e d by t h e A m e r i ca n P s y c ho l og i ca l A ss o c i a ti on o r on e o f it s a lli e d pub li s h e r s .

Although several published results pointed to a positive rela - tionship between WMC and insight problem solving ability , it might be possible that such a relationship exists for only some functions of WM , but not others . For example , Wiley and Jarosz ( 2012 ) , citing Fleck ( 2008 ) , suggested that insight may be more strongly related to storage than to executive control and to com - plex span , but did not formally test this difference in the data . Gilhooly and Fioratou ( 2009 ) , using hierarchical linear regression , indeed found that switching ability ( possibly involving executive control ) was a significant predictor for performance on noninsight problems , but not on insight ones ; however , the difference in their 120 - people sample was not significant . Chuderski ( 2014 ) found a similar contribution to insight of both executive control and stor - age , but he noted a weaker link for binding ( important for fluid reasoning ) . In Analysis 1 , individual capacities were measured for each of the five above listed WM functions . Three tasks per function were used ( with an exception for updating ) , and relevant latent variables were calculated . Then , using CFA , we assessed correlations be - tween each WM function and insight ability , and between WM function and reasoning ability . We tested for any differences in correlation strengths between the functions , as well as between insight and reasoning for a particular function . The True Strength of the Relationship Between General WMC and Insight Problem Solving Ability Even if all key functions of WM contributed to insight ability , the “true strength” of the relationship between the general WMC factor and insight problem solving is unknown . As most reported effect sizes pertained to single insight tests ( often encompassing just a few insight problems ) , the reliability and validity of such tests must have been ( and was ) limited , and the links found must have been specific and attenuated , compared with the true strength of the relationship . Simply , the maximum strength of correlation between even two isomorphic measures cannot surpass the square root of the product of their reliabilities . To date , no study has measured insight problem solving with a varied and large enough battery of problems that could reflect insight ability at the latent level . Nor has any study related this ability to WMC defined as a higher - level factor , loading on several WM functions . Only such a method allows for estimation of the true size of the link between insight ability and WMC ( unspoiled by low reliability , test pecu - liarity , and stimulus modality ) . Thus , the goal of Analysis 2 was to assess the true size of the relationship between insight ability and WMC . The Relationship Between WMC and Insight Problem Solving Ability for Subjective Measures of Insight Recent studies ( e . g . , Danek et al . , 2016 ; Fleck & Weisberg , 2013 ; Salvi et al . , 2016 ; Webb et al . , 2016 ) that have analyzed participants’ reports about their experience of insight during in - sight problem solving suggest that it may be required for solving only some of the existing problems , whereas other problems do not elicit such an experience . Moreover , differences in solution strat - egy exist , with only a relatively low proportion of participants reporting insight , while others admit the use of more systematic strategies ( for a discussion , see Weisberg , 2015 ) . It is possible that WMC predicts solutions that are not accompanied by subjectively perceived insight , whereas “real” insightful solutions are unrelated to WMC . To test this possibility , for each verbal and spatial insight problem , each remote associate and each matchstick equation ( but not for the math problems , for justification see below ) we recorded participants’ ratings of whether or not “the solution came suddenly and unexpectedly to mind” ( henceforth , both correct and incorrect solutions which were rated positively are called insightful ) . In Analysis 3 , we reran Analysis 2 , but used two subjective scores for each test : ( 1 ) the proportion of correctly solved insightful problems in all problems ( “insight accuracy” ) and ( 2 ) the proportion of correctly solved noninsightful problems in all problems ( “analysis accuracy” ) . We tested if insight accuracy yielded either weaker ( as expected by the special - process account ) or comparable ( as pre - dicted by the nothing - special account ) correlations with WMC , as compared with analysis accuracy . Threshold in the WMC - insight Ability Relationship A well - known prediction pertaining to creativity called the threshold hypothesis ( Barron , 1969 ; Guilford , 1967 ) assumes that a certain level of cognitive ability is a necessary condition for an individual to produce creative thought ( or outcome ) . Recently , by means of a novel statistical technique , Jauk et al . ( 2013 ) suggested that such a threshold does indeed exist . It was rather low ( IQ 85 ) for fluency on a divergent thinking test , and higher for originality ( IQ range (cid:3) 100 – 120 ) , but there was no threshold for creative achievement ( the self - reported real success in creative domains , such as art , literature , and science ) . Analogously , a significant WMC effect on insight may exist only for people below a given threshold , while participants above this threshold may already have the necessary cognitive resources to solve insight problems ( ceiling effect for WMC ) , so the real link is null . Due to the mathematical properties of correlation , even when only a minority of a sample shows the effect , the correlation can still be substantial ( Smolen & Chuderski , 2015 ) . In Analysis 4 , in order to test the possibility of threshold in the WMC - insight ability link , we ex - amined invariance of WMC - insight correlations for groups below / above the mean in fluid reasoning . Mediation of Personality and Motivational Variables Unlike reasoning ability ( Ackerman & Heggestad , 1997 ; Moutafi , Furnham , & Crump , 2003 ) , creative problem solving T h i s do c u m e n t i s c opy r i gh t e d by t h e A m e r i ca n P s y c ho l og i ca l A ss o c i a ti on o r on e o f it s a lli e d pub li s h e r s .

Apart from openness to experience , which notably links to creativity for rather trivial reasons ( it reflects novelty seeking as well as is the personality trait most strongly related to intelligence ; Kaufman , 2013 ; Moutafi et al . , 2003 ) , the most replicated ( Rawlings , 1985 ) and interpretable link ( Eysenck , 1993 ) exists for psychoticism—a tendency toward ego - centric , impulsive , and antisocial behavior . It is suggested that the prolonged self - focus , strong self - assertion , and breaking of the established rules helps to deliver creative outcomes . However , similar factors ( e . g . , anxiety ) were reported to influence WM and fluid reasoning ( e . g . , Chuderski , 2014 ; Eysenck , Payne , & Derak - shan , 2005 ; Owens , Stevenson , Hadwin , & Norgate , 2014 ; Un - sworth et al . , 2009 ) . Thus , it is at least theoretically possible that individual differences in state anxiety , motivation level , and / or personality traits can mediate to some extent the WMC - insight link . In Analysis 5 , the links between residual variances in WM and insight variables were examined after explaining them by age , psychoticism , openness to experience , state anxiety , and motiva - tion . The Study In this section we report how we determined our sample size , all data exclusions ( if any ) , all manipulations , and all measures in the study . Participants We defined a relatively large sample size , surpassing the sam - ples studied to date in insight research . The sample included 318 volunteers ( 216 women , 102 men ) recruited via advertisements on popular networking websites . Participants were paid the equivalent of 20 euros in Polish zloty . The mean age was 24 . 5 years ( SD (cid:3) 6 . 02 , range 18 – 46 ) . The sample included 3 secondary school pupils , 17 people who attended high school and another 55 who graduated it , 165 college students , and 78 people holding a BA or MA degree ( or equivalent ) . All participants had normal or corrected - to - normal vision . All participants were informed in a general way that the study investigates human thinking , that their data would be anonymous , and that they could end their partici - pation at will at any moment . The study was carried out in accordance with the ethical principles of the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki as well as the psychological research guidelines sug - gested by the Polish National Science Center ( www . ncn . gov . pl ) . Materials For the insight problem categories that were described above , we chose 19 classical problems ( consisting of six verbal , six spatial , and seven math problems ) as well as 15 remote associates and 8 matchstick equations . The classical problems were selected on the basis of two criteria : ( 1 ) they were used in at least two studies that , for the given task , reported effects typical for insight problems ( frequent impasse etc . ) ; and ( 2 ) their reported accuracy was around 33 % ; this is the optimal trade - off between the required difficulty and the avoidance of the floor effect . We tried to select the most frequently used problems . For remote associates , we selected 15 out of 24 items used in our previous study ( Chuderski , 2014 ) which yielded accuracy levels of around 33 % . For match - stick equations , we used two chunk decomposition ( CD ) and two constraint relaxation ( CR ) items from Knöblich et al . ( 1999 ) and designed two CD and two CR items ( see below ) . However , these two new CR items did not yield the expected difficulty and were discarded , so the final set included six matchstick equations . There were 40 insight problems in total—probably the largest set of insight problems ever used in a study . All insight problem solving tests were paper - and - pencil tests . We also used four paper - and - pencil fluid reasoning tests ( with 74 items in total ) , as well as 13 computerized WM tasks . Five questionnaires investigated person - ality , anxiety , and motivation . Verbal and spatial problems . In order to decrease transfer and learning effects , we interleaved the six verbal and the six spatial problems on two pieces of paper . See Table 1 for the description of the problems , in the order matching the actual test . The verbal problems included Woman and policeman , Candle , The game of checkers , Four coins , Two people , and Two strings . The spatial problems consisted of Triangle , Pig pen , Four dots , Sheep pen , Figure L , and Ten dots . The task instructions specified flex - ible and nonstandard thinking , and required the answer for each problem to be written below the problem . Participants were given 20 min to complete the test . The numbers of solutions that satisfied the description of the respective problems were taken as the verbal problems and the spatial problems scores . Each problem also included a box to be checked by a participant if this problem’s solution “came to mind suddenly and unexpectedly” ( for discus - sion and justification of this method see Bowden et al . , 2005 ) . Participants were reminded that they should report their subjective state when arriving at solutions . Math problems . The test included seven math problems pre - viously used in insight problem solving studies ( e . g . , Lilies , Horse trading ; see Frederick , 2005 ; Weisberg , 1995 ) . Unlike the verbal and spatial problems , for which initially the solver cannot find any answer , for each math problem there is an intuitive , but incorrect solution that results from a specific misrepresentation of the prob - lem ( see Table 2 ) . To solve the problem , one needs to override the initial incorrect solution ( or avoid the misrepresentation in the first place ) and come up with a proper , more reflective representation of the problem . As some problems have already been popularized in the media , we changed the specific contents of these problems while leaving their internal structures intact ( e . g . , the spread of water lilies was substituted by the spread of fire in a forest ) . Descriptions of all math problems were printed on one paper sheet , and participants wrote their solutions directly below each respec - tive problem . The number of correctly solved problems in five minutes represented the score on this test . One easy problem ( Seven sisters ) preceded the seven problems as a run - up , and was not included in the score . Because for this test both incorrect and correct solutions come to mind suddenly , this was the only test for which the subjective reports on solutions were not collected . Matchstick equations . The test included 16 matchstick equations printed on two sides of a single sheet of paper ( see Table 3 for the equations list , in the order in which they appeared in the test ) . There were eight standard type ( ST ) problems that were relatively easy to solve analytically ( they acted as controls ) . Such problems required moving a vertical matchstick from one numeral to another ( e . g . , “I (cid:4) V (cid:3) IV” ¡ T h i s do c u m e n t i s c opy r i gh t e d by t h e A m e r i ca n P s y c ho l og i ca l A ss o c i a ti on o r on e o f it s a lli e d pub li s h e r s .

The eight remaining items were meant to require restructuring in order to discover a nonstandard move of one matchstick that made the equation correct . Two more difficult CD problems called for the decomposing of chunk “V” into “X” or vice versa ( Knoblich et al . , 1999 ) . Two even more difficult CR problems required relaxation of the constraint that only one equal sign is allowed per equation ( Knoblich et al . , 1999 ) . Two newly designed items required introducing a neg - ative number by changing the number “I” into a minus sign , and another two such items called for equating two positive / nega - tive numbers by eliminating the number “I” and making a plus / minus sign . Participants were given 20 min to complete all 16 problems and were instructed to think in a nonstandard and creative way . Items from each pair were printed on the opposite sides of the paper sheet , so one could not directly see the analogy between the two items . Unfortunately , problems 2 and 16 appeared too easy ( mean accuracy around 90 % , matching the ST equations ) , so the final score on the test was the sum of correctly solved problems out of six equations ( Items 4 , 5 , 7 , 9 , 12 , 13 ) . The check - boxes for subjective ratings ( a solution “came to mind suddenly and unexpectedly” ) were placed beside each equation . Remote associates . The task included 15 remote associates problems ( Mednick , 1962 ) verified in our previous study ( Chud - erski , 2014 ; note that they are untranslatable from Polish to Eng - lish ) . Ten minutes were given to complete all remote associates . Also in this test , the subjective ratings were collected , as in the verbal and spatial problems test and the matchstick equations test . Active maintenance tasks . Active maintenance of informa - tion in WM was measured with three variants of the visual arrays task ( Cowan , 2001 ; Luck & Vogel , 1997 ) . Each of the 90 trials in each of the tasks consisted of a virtual , 4 (cid:2) 4 array filled with five , seven or nine stimuli ( i . e . , only some cells in the array were filled ) . The stimuli were 10 Greek symbols ( e . g . , (cid:9) , (cid:10) , (cid:11) ) , 10 figures ( e . g . , a square , a triangle , a star ) or squares in 10 distinctive colors , in the letter , figure and color arrays , respectively . The array was pre - sented for the time equal to the number of stimuli presented multiplied by 0 . 5 s , and followed by a 1 - s black square mask of the same size as the array . In a random half of the trials , the second array was identical to the first , while in the remaining trials both differed by exactly one item at one location . If they differed , the new item was highlighted by a square red border . If they were identical , a random item was highlighted . The task was to press one of two response keys , depending on whether the highlighted item differed or not in the two arrays ( see Figure 1 for a sample trial ) . The second array was shown until a response was given or 8 s elapsed . The task was preceded by six training trials . The score on the task was the estimated number of objects held in the storage capacity buffer ( the k value ; Cowan , 2001 ) , calculated as the difference between the proportion of correct responses for arrays with one item changed and incorrect responses for unchanged arrays , multiplied by the set size . The total scores were the mean k in each task . Storage and processing tasks . Each of the three variants of the complex span task , which was used to assess the storage and processing function of WM , required memorizing four , six , or eight ( set size ) stimuli , presented for 1 . 2 s apiece . Each stimulus was followed by a simple decision task to prevent the chunking of stimuli . The participants were instructed to recall as many stimuli T a b l e 1 ( c on ti nu e d ) P r ob l e m n a m e P r ob l e m d e s c r i p ti on S a m p l e s o l u ti on A cc u r ac y I n s i gh t acc u r ac y (cid:7) W M C s o l v e r s (cid:7) W M C i n s i gh t F i gu r e L D i v i d e t h e f i gu r e i n t o f ou r e qu a l p a r t s . . 03 . 13 1 . 15 . 36 T w o s t r i ng s T w o s t r i ng s h a ng fr o m a ce ili ng bu t a r e t oo f a r a p a r t t o a ll o w a p e r s on t o ho l d on e a nd g r a b t h e o t h e r .

Five trials for each set size ( in increasing order ) were presented in each variant . The letter span task required memorizing letters , while indicating with a mouse button whether or not intermittent simple arithmetical equations ( e . g . , 2 (cid:2) 3 – 1 (cid:3) 5 ? ) were correct ( see Figure 1 ) . The digit span consisted of memorizing digits , and the decision task was to decide whether the five - letter string presented after each stimulus started and ended with a consonant ( e . g . , “KVTAR ) , or started and ended with a vowel ( e . g . , “ENYBA” ) . In the figure span task , participants memorized simple geometric figures , while judging colors as light ( yellow or beige ) or dark ( brown or navy blue ) . During response procedure , in each task as many 3 (cid:2) 3 matrices as was a particular set size were displayed . Each matrix contained the same set of all nine possible stimuli for a given task . The participants were required to select with the mouse those stimuli that had been presented in a sequence , in the correct order . There was no time limit for responding . The dependent variable for each complex span task was the proportion of correctly selected stimuli of the 90 stimuli presented in the task . The WM updating task . To assess the updating function of WM , we used just one task—mental counters ( Larson , Merritt , & Table 2 Description of Math Problems Applied in the Study Problem name Problem description Correctsolution Implicated incorrect solution Accuracy (cid:7) WMCsolvers Bat and ball A flashlight and a battery cost $ 11 in total .

There were two reasons for using just this task . First , it is the best of several existing updating tasks at conceptually reflecting the updating of information ( it requires updating of the number of times a particular stimulus appears in a sequence ) . Other tasks , such as n - back ( Kirchner , 1958 ) or the running memory task ( Pollack , Johnson , & Knaff , 1959 ) , either have been criticized for assessing processes beyond WMC ( Chuderski & Necka , 2012 ; Kane et al . , 2007 ; Roberts & Gibson , 2002 ) or , on the other hand , have reflected the variance isomorphic to nonupdating WM tasks ( e . g . , Chuderski , Taraday , Necka , & Smolen , 2012 ; Ecker , Le - wandowsky , Oberauer , & Chee , 2010 ; Schmiedek , Hildebrandt , Lövdén , Lindenberger , & Wilhelm , 2009 ) . Second , in a previous study of one of us ( Chuderski et al . , 2012 ) , the mental counters task yielded an internal consistency of (cid:9) (cid:3) . 97 and loaded at r (cid:3) . 902 on the updating latent variable ( strongly surpassing the n - back and the keep track task ; Yntema & Mueser , 1962 ) . Thus , the mental counters task accounts for most of the updating variance . The task consisted of a sequence of 120 single letters ( B , C or D ) presented in random order in the center of the screen ( plus 12 training letters ) . The goal was to count how many times each letter had been presented , up to four ( see Figure 1 ) . Each time a letter was presented , participants provided a response by pressing one of the two response keys to indicate whether they had seen the letter for the fourth time ( target ) or less than four ( nontarget ) . So , after each fourth occurrence , participants should have reset their mental counter of a particular letter to zero . In order to help resetting the counters , the participants were presented with feedback after false alarms and missed targets . Each letter , approximately 2 (cid:2) 2 cm in size , was displayed for 2 . 5 s , followed by a mask displayed for 0 . 3 s . The final scores were the proportion of correct hits in the target trials and correct rejections in the nontarget trials . Executive control tasks . Three tasks were used to measure executive control : the antisaccade ( Hallett , 1978 ) , the Stroop ( see MacLeod , 1991 ) , and the go / no - go ( Eimer , 1993 ) . The antisaccade task consisted of five training and 50 test trials . Each test trial consisted of four events ( see Figure 1 ) . First , a cue was presented for 1 . 5 s , reminding participants that a target would be presented in the middle of the side opposite from the flashing square . Next , a fixation point was presented at the center of the screen for between 1 s and 2 s . Then , a rapidly flashing black square ( 3 cm in size ) was shown on the left or right side of the screen , about 16 cm from the fixation point , for 0 . 2 s . Finally , a small dark gray arrow ( 0 . 6 cm long ) , pointing left , down , or right , was presented in the location opposite the square for 0 . 15 s and was then replaced by a mask . The visual angle from both the square and the arrow to the fixation point was around 15° . The task was to look away from the flashing square , to detect the direction of the arrow , and to press the arrow key matching the stimulus arrow . The trials were self - paced . The dependent variable in the task was mean accuracy . The stimuli in the classic color - word variant of the Stroop task were four capital Polish words ( approx . 7 cm (cid:2) 2 cm in size ) , printed in bold Arial font , naming the colors red , green , blue , and brown . Each word could be displayed in any of the four ink colors . For congruent stimuli ( random 200 trials ) , the meaning of the word and the color of the ink were the same . For incongruent stimuli ( another 50 trials ) , the former differed from the latter . There was a constraint that the direct repetition of the target stimuli was not possible . Trials lasted until a response was given , or for a maxi - mum of 2 . 2 s , and a 0 . 5 - s mask separated the subsequent trials . The instruction was to avoid reading a word and to press a response key ( Z , X , N , or M ) that was assigned to a respective color . The stimuli were displayed in the center of the screen , and a reminder of the response buttons was displayed at the bottom . The task was pre - ceded by a training session that included 20 neutral stimuli ( HH - HHHHH strings ) , aimed at strengthening the stimulus - key associ - ations . The dependent variable was the difference between mean accuracy in the incongruent and congruent trials . In the go / no - go task , digits ( 1 or 2 ) were presented sequentially in the center of the screen . The task was to categorize the presented number by pressing one of the two respective keys when the digit was displayed in a color other than green ( red , blue , or yellow ; go trials ) , but to withhold the response if the presented digit was green ( no - go trials ) . Trials lasted until a response was given , or for a maximum of 0 . 9 s , and each trial was followed by a 0 . 1 - ms mask . There were 325 go and 25 no - go trials . The score on the task was mean accuracy on no - go trials . Binding task . Three variants of the relation monitoring task , originally introduced by Oberauer et al . ( 2007 ) , and later modified by Chuderski ( 2014 ) , were used to measure the capacity to set and maintain bindings between information held in WM .

Each trial included a 3 (cid:2) 3 array ( approx . 6 (cid:2) 6 cm in size ) of pairs of stimuli ( see Figure 1 ) . The stimuli were Greek letters , digits or figures ( e . g . , triangle , square ) in letter , digit , and figure variants , respectively . On each trial , only one ( random ) of the three following relations between the stimuli was present : there were three pairs in a row or a column ending with the same stimulus ( three - same ) , three pairs in a row or a column ending with a different stimulus ( three - different ) , or there was a pair of iden - tical stimuli , which was a control condition . The task was to detect the relation in an array , and respond by pressing one of the three respective keys ( a reminder of the response keys was displayed at the bottom of the screen ) . To decrease the amount of information changed from trial to trial , four pairs ( at random ) in each subse - quent array were the same as in the preceding array . Trials lasted until a response was given , to a maximum of 10 s . Each task consisted of 120 trials ( and 10 training trials ) . The total score on each task was the mean accuracy on the three - same and three - different trials . As the task did not require active storage of stimuli in WM ( which were present on the screen for the total duration of a trial ) , but it demanded detecting the relationships between se - lected elements , the task is assumed to capture the ability to construct bindings in WM ( for justification see Chuderski , 2014 ; Oberauer et al . , 2007 ) . Fluid reasoning tests . Four tests of fluid reasoning were used . Two tests included figural material . The well - known Raven’s Advanced Progressive Matrices ( Raven , Court , & Raven , 1983 ) consists of items that include a three - by - three matrix of figural patterns which is missing the bottom - right pattern , and eight re - sponse options comprising the patterns that can potentially match the missing one . The goal is to discover the rules that govern the distribution of patterns and to apply them to the response options in order to choose the single correct pattern . The Figural Analogies Test ( Chuderski & Necka , 2012 ) consists of analogies in the form of “A is to B as C is to X , ” where A , B , and C are relatively simple patterns of figures . A is related to B according to two , three , four , or five rules ( e . g . , symmetry , rotation , change in size , color , thickness , number of objects ) , and X is an empty space . The task is to choose one figure from a choice of four which relates to Figure C , as B relates to A . In each test , 18 odd - numbered items out of 36 original items were used , printed on several sheets of paper ; the administration time was half of the original ( 20 min and 15 min , respectively ) . In the newly designed number series test ( Number series ) , the task is to find the hidden rule according to which a sequence or an array of numbers is constructed , and to complete the sequence or the array with the missing number . Participants were given 18 min to solve 18 number series prob - lems . The fourth reasoning test ( logic ) required deductive reason - ing in order to infer one out of four ( one logically valid and three invalid ) conclusions from a set of premises in syllogistic , propo - sitional , and predicate calculi . Premises were described in natural language . Some incorrect conclusions were believable ( consistent with common knowledge ) and this made the task of choosing the logically correct answer even more difficult . The score on the test was the sum of correct conclusions selected in all 20 items within 20 min . There were 74 fluid reasoning test items in total ( see Figure 2 for sample items ) . Personality questionnaires . We aimed to measure three la - tent variables reflecting personality traits—extraversion , neuroti - cism , and psychoticism—assumed by the PEN model of person - ality ( Eysenck , 1990 ) . However , we used more recent scales for measuring the traits ; the Polish adaptations of the NEO - Five Factor Inventory ( NEO - FFI ; Costa & McCrae , 1992 ) , Behavioral Inhibition / Activation System scales ( BIS / BAS ; Carver & White , 1994 ) , and the brief Dark Triad Scale ( Jonason & Webster , 2010 ) , the latter measuring Machiavellianism , narcissism , and psychop - 1 3 5 7 9 12 15 18 21 25 29 33 37 42 47 ?

The extraversion variable was loaded by the NEO - FFI ex - traversion subscale and BAS , the neuroticism variable included the neuroticism subscale and BIS , and the psychoticism variable com - bined the agreeableness subscale ( reversed ) and the Dark Triad score . We also used the Openness to Experience scale from NEO - FFI . Anxiety and motivation measures . Anxiety was assessed with 12 items of the Polish adaptation of the X - 1 part of the State – Trait Anxiety Inventory ( STAI ; Spielberger , Gorsuch , & Lushene , 1970 ) . X - 1 measures state anxiety and contains questions about the current emotional state of a participant , such as “I am relaxed” ( reversed scoring ) or “I am nervous” . Motivation to deal with the tasks was probed with a set of 10 questions , for example , “It was important to me to perform well in the task” . The total score on each motivation and STAI measurement was the sum of answers obtained using a 5 - point Likert scale . Procedure . Participants were tested in a psychological labo - ratory in groups of six people on average . The session was divided into two 4 - hr parts with a 45 - min lunch break between them . Each part included a 15 - min break and several shorter breaks in order to prevent mental fatigue . Cookies and tea / coffee / water were served throughout to maintain optimal levels of glucose , arousal , and hydration . In order to minimize procedure - dependent variance , all the tasks were applied in the following fixed order . The insight , WM , and reasoning tests were intermixed in order to balance such factors as tiredness , boredom , learning effects , and so forth . The tasks for each WM function were grouped , to minimize the time devoted to understanding the task instructions . The first part of the procedure included : mental counters , math , logic , verbal and spa - tial problems , letter binding , digit binding , figure binding , letter span , digit span , and figure span . After the lunch break , partici - pants completed : letter arrays , figure arrays , color arrays , Raven matrices , analogies , antisaccade , Stroop , go / no - go , matchstick equations , remote associates , number series , and personality ques - tionnaires ( computerized variants ) . Several other tests serving sci - entific aims unrelated to the present study were also administered during the session , including a computerized transitive reasoning test , an analogical pattern matching task , a probability assessment task , as well as questionnaires of rationality and religiosity . The motivation and anxiety level of each participant was assessed at the beginning , in the middle , and at the end of data collection . Importantly , regardless of the whole - day procedure , there was no significant drop in motivation level , F ( 2 , 634 ) (cid:3) 0 . 19 , while anxiety even decreased from its first to the second measurement , F ( 1 , 317 ) (cid:3) 30 . 99 , p (cid:12) . 001 . Data screening and elimination . Regarding the insight , WM , and reasoning scores , there were no missing data . Cook’s distance revealed no multivariate outliers ( all D s (cid:12) 1 . 0 ) . For anxiety and motivation , single scores were missing for one participant , and they were substituted with the mean from the two remaining measurements . For personality questionnaires , some scores were missing for 13 participants , and they were not substituted , so Analysis 5 used data from 305 people . Model fitting . The fit of CFA / SEM models was evaluated by three indices of fit ( see Hu & Bentler , 1999 ; Kline , 1998 ) : the chi - square statistic ( its value divided by the number of degrees of freedom should not surpass (cid:11) 2 [ 2 . 0 ] ) , the comparative fit index ( CFI should exceed . 92 ) , and the root mean square error of ap - proximation ( RMSEA should be less than . 08 ) . Comparing the well - fitting initial model with alternative models ( i . e . , either more constrained models , with some parameters fixed , or the group models , in which parameters were calculated separately for two groups ) , we investigated whether a simpler model ( with more degrees of freedom ) yielded a worse fit , as indicated by a signif - icant increase in the chi - square statistic ( if it did not , then this simpler model was preferred ) . Results Table 4 provides descriptive statistics and reliabilities for all 44 measures used in the CFA and SEM analyses . As many as 37 scores fit the widely accepted rule - of - thumb criteria of normality ( skew (cid:12) 2 . 0 , kurtosis (cid:12) 4 . 0 ) . All four insight accuracy measures slightly deviated from normality due to floor effects , which are commonly reported for subjective measures ( e . g . , Fleck & Weis - berg , 2013 ) . Also , the Stroop and go / no - go scores slightly deviated from normality due to ceiling effects , reflecting the common psychometric problems with these measures ( see Chuderski , 2014 ) . The same observation applied to the nontarget accuracy in the mental counters task . As none of these deviations from nor - mality was substantial , and the maximal likelihood estimation is relatively robust , we decided not to transform the deviating data in any way . Reliabilities for most of the tasks were acceptable or high ( (cid:9) s (cid:5) . 65 ) , with the exception of verbal ( (cid:9) (cid:3) . 42 ) and spatial problems ( (cid:9) (cid:3) . 48 ) , as well as the corresponding insight accuracy and analysis accuracy measures . This fact indicated the above mentioned psychometric inadequacy of classical insight problems ( probably related to their idiosyncrasy ) . However , reliability for all the 12 classical problems was higher ( (cid:9) (cid:3) . 58 ) . Accuracy on single insight problems ( see Tables 1 - 3 ) suggested that most of the problems were sufficiently difficult for partici - pants , with accuracy oscillating around 33 % . Problem Ten dots , solved only by three participants ( M (cid:3) . 01 ) , was the most difficult ( but was also the last problem on the paper sheet ) , whereas Four coins was the easiest ( M (cid:3) . 61 ) . Finally , Table 5 presents the correlation matrix for all variables used in Analyses 1 through 4 . Table 6 shows data used in Analysis 5 . These data were used to test the consecutive CFA and SEM models presented below . Relationships of the specific WM functions to insight and reasoning ability ( Analysis 1 ) . The results of CFA , which mod - eled seven factors ( the storage , storage & processing , updating , executive control , binding , insight ability , and reasoning ability latent variables ) are presented in Figure 3 , and the correlations between the WM factors are presented in Table 7 . The model had a good fit to the data , (cid:11) 2 ( 209 ) (cid:3) 357 . 63 , (cid:11) 2 ( 1 . 71 ) , CFI (cid:3) . 958 , RMSEA (cid:3) . 048 [ . 039 – . 056 ] . Inspection of the factor loadings on respective measures indicated that , for the insight ability variable , all tests had satisfactory validity ( loadings of at least . 565 ) , espe - cially given the low number of items that each test included . The exception was the remote associate test that , despite counting as many as 15 items , showed low validity ( . 395 ) . For reasoning ability , the two figural tests yielded slightly higher loadings than the two alphanumerical tests , but all loadings were satisfactory ( . 693 or higher ) . All WM measures properly loaded the respective variables ( . 633 or higher ) , except for the loadings of the Stroop ( . 459 ) and go / no - go tasks ( . 376 ) on executive control , probably due to their weak psychometric quality . As expected , all WM T h i s do c u m e n t i s c opy r i gh t e d by t h e A m e r i ca n P s y c ho l og i ca l A ss o c i a ti on o r on e o f it s a lli e d pub li s h e r s .

However , no link approached unity , so all WM func - tions were clearly identifiable . The positive correlations between the consecutive WM func - tions and insight ability were all significant at p (cid:12) . 001 and varied between r (cid:3) . 491 ( storage ) and r (cid:3) . 759 ( executive control ) . Analogous links with reasoning were stronger by (cid:7) r (cid:6) . 15 , with binding being the weakest correlate ( r (cid:3) . 675 ) , while executive control was the strongest ( r (cid:3) . 920 ) . As the magnitude of differ - ences in correlations for particular WM functions was limited , the invariance model was tested . This model assumed that the loadings of all five WM functions on the insight ability variable were equal , and that the loadings of these functions on the reasoning ability variable were equal ( but different than the loading on insight ) . Such a model had an additional eight degrees of freedom , but its fit worsened significantly , (cid:7)(cid:11) 2 ( 8 ) (cid:3) 22 . 53 , p (cid:3) . 004 , so it was rejected . Interestingly , the correlation between the insight and reasoning ability variables was as strong as r (cid:3) . 920 , suggesting that these variables might not be distinguishable , and thus any further com - parisons between the WM contributions to insight versus reason - ing might be meaningless . However , due to a negligible standard error , the model which assumed a correlation of r (cid:3) 1 . 0 between both variables yielded a significant loss of fit , (cid:7)(cid:11) 2 ( 1 ) (cid:3) 11 . 02 , p (cid:12) Table 4 Descriptive Statistics and Reliabilities for all Measures Used in the Study Measure Variable Mean SD Min .

Thus , we assumed that both variables are separate , though extremely strongly intercorrelated , sharing as much as 84 . 6 % of their variance . The strength of relationship of the high - level WMC factor to insight and reasoning ability ( Analysis 2 ) . In order to express in the model the general effectiveness of WM in a wide range of WM tasks , we introduced another latent variable that loaded all five latent variables reflecting the WM functions investigated . The model also included the insight and reasoning ability variables correlated with WMC . The fit of the resulting model ( see Figure 4 ) was good , (cid:11) 2 ( 222 ) (cid:3) 386 . 26 , (cid:11) 2 ( 1 . 74 ) , CFI (cid:3) . 953 , RMSEA (cid:3) . 050 [ . 042 – . 058 ] . The loadings of WM functions on WMC varied between r (cid:3) . 676 ( binding ) and r (cid:3) . 990 ( executive control ) . The WMC factor was strongly linked to insight ( r (cid:3) . 720 ) , and very strongly to reasoning ( r (cid:3) . 933 ) , though the latter link was sig - nificantly below unity , (cid:7)(cid:11) 2 ( 1 ) (cid:3) 11 . 59 , p (cid:12) . 001 . The relationship to WMC of reasoning was significantly stronger than the relation - ship of WMC with insight , as equating them substantially de - creased the fit of the model , (cid:7)(cid:11) 2 ( 1 ) (cid:3) 30 . 07 , p (cid:12) . 001 . Next , by means of SEM , we used WMC to predict the insight and reasoning ability variables , in order to investigate the corre - lation between the residual variances of these variables ( i . e . , dis - turbance terms , reflecting for each variable the variance unex - plained by WMC ) . The resulting model had the same structure as the CFA model and therefore the same goodness of fit , as well as the same coefficients for links between insight and WMC , and reasoning and WMC . In this model , the insight and reasoning disturbances correlated weakly ( r (cid:3) . 248 , p (cid:12) . 001 ) , meaning that only 6 . 1 % of insight ability variance unaccounted for by WMC was shared with reasoning ability . So , the strong link between insight and reasoning was primarily due to their common WMC mechanisms . It is possible that various insight problems depend differently on WM ( see Batchelder & Alexander , 2012 ; Fleck , 2008 ) , so the WMC correlation of a given insight test might be driven by a small number of its items , while most items might be unrelated to WMC . To assess the role of WMC for each individual insight problem and matchstick equation , the WMC factor value was compared be - tween solvers and nonsolvers of a given item , and the effect size was expressed as the difference in SD ( see the respective columns of Tables 1 through 3 ) . For most of these items ( 19 out of 25 ) , solvers had a higher WMC at p (cid:12) . 01 or less . Averaging across all 25 insight problems / equations , the WMC of solvers surpassed that of nonsolvers ( (cid:7) M (cid:3) 0 . 57 , SD (cid:3) 0 . 28 , p (cid:12) . 001 ) . The respective average difference for remote associates was (cid:7) M (cid:3) 0 . 34 , SD (cid:3) 0 . 19 , p (cid:12) . 001 .

Relationships of WMC and reasoning ability to problems solved with insight versus by analysis ( Analysis 3 ) . In order to establish whether the solutions of insight problems accompanied by ( reported ) insight differed in their relationship to WMC and reasoning ability , compared with the solutions without insight ( i . e . , supposedly reached by some incremental , analytical processes ) , the insight ability latent variable from the CFA model in Analysis 2 was split into two corresponding variables . The first of these was the insight variable loaded by insight accuracy on the verbal and spatial problems as well as the matchstick equations and remote associates ( please remember that no subjective reports for the math problems were collected ) . The second was the analysis variable , loaded by analysis accuracy on the same four tests . The model ( see Figure 5 ) yielded good fit , (cid:11) 2 ( 288 ) (cid:3) 507 . 45 , (cid:11) 2 ( 1 . 76 ) , CFI (cid:3) . 937 , RMSEA (cid:3) . 049 [ . 042 – . 056 ] . Naturally , the insight’ and analysis variables were not significantly correlated ( r (cid:3) (cid:8) . 062 ) , as the more a person reported insightful solutions , the less she or he reported the noninsightful solutions . Although the WMC and rea - soning correlation coefficients seemed to be numerically higher for the analysis variable , compared with the insight’ variable ( (cid:7) r (cid:6) . 10 ) , their pairwise equaling between insight’ and analysis ( to r (cid:3) . 520 for WMC and r (cid:3) . 650 for reasoning ) did not bring about any significant loss of fit , (cid:7)(cid:11) 2 ( 2 ) (cid:3) 2 . 07 , p (cid:3) . 355 . Analogously to Analysis 2 , we also compared the WMC of people who solved each single insight problem / matchstick equa - tion using insight with the WMC of those solving it by means of analysis ( see the last columns of Tables 1 and 3 ) . The comparison revealed that significant differences ( with p (cid:12) . 01 of the two - tailed t test ) in WMC for insight versus noninsight solvers were observed in only two items ( and those who reported insight showed higher STORAGE IN WM STORAGE AND PROCESSING WM UPDATING EXECUTIVECONTROL BINDING IN WM REASONINGABILITY INSIGHT ABILITY WORKING MEMORY CAPACITY . 48 . 13 . 25 [ . 16 - . 34 ] . 94 [ . 90 - . 98 ] . 72 [ . 64 - . 80 ] . 79 [ . 73 - . 85 ] . 83 [ . 79 - . 89 ] . 73 [ . 63 - . 83 ] . 99 [ . 89 - 1 . 0 ] . 68 [ . 60 - . 76 ] Figure 4 .

Averaging across 17 insight problems / equations , the WMC difference in favor of insight solvers was only (cid:7) M (cid:3) 0 . 24 , SD (cid:3) 0 . 16 ( ns ) , whereas the average difference for remote asso - ciates was even smaller , (cid:7) M (cid:3) 0 . 12 , SD (cid:3) 0 . 41 ( ns ) . Thus , whether people declared insight when solving the problems was not apparently related to WMC . Testing the threshold in the WMC - insight problem - solving relationship ( Analysis 4 ) . In Analysis 4 , we calculated the CFA model which related the WMC variable only to the insight ability variable , whereas the value of the reasoning ability variable was used as a criterion ( breakpoint ) for splitting the sample into two groups . Then , although the model assumed invariance in factor loadings , it estimated the WMC - insight ability correlations sepa - rately for the groups of people below and above the breakpoint . As existing studies have reported varied breakpoints ( see Jauk et al . , 2013 ) , we calculated three alternative models , with the breakpoint set at 0 . 5 standard deviation below the mean in the reasoning ability factor , at that mean , and at 0 . 5 standard deviation above that mean ( i . e . , correcting by (cid:4) 5 IQ points for our academic - city , young - adult sample , the thresholds equaled around 97 , 105 , and 113 IQ , respectively ) . We tested whether assuming invariance in the WMC - insight ability correlation for the groups would harm the fit in any of the three models ( indicating the different relationship of WMC to insight ability between the groups ) . However , it did not , as the (cid:7)(cid:11) 2 for the invariance models was highly nonsignifi - cant , (cid:7)(cid:11) 2 ( 1 ) (cid:3) 0 . 01 , 0 . 91 , and 0 . 92 ( all p s (cid:5) . 33 ) , for the 98 - , 105 - , and 113 - IQ model variants , respectively . Thus , it seems that every WMC point counted for insight problem solving ability . For each model variant , we also tested if the invariance of factor loadings of the WMC latent variable on the respective WM func - tions as well as of the insight variable on the respective insight tests harmed the model fit , as compared with the model variants in which both the WMC - insight ability correlation and the factor loadings could vary freely between the groups . No significant loss of fit was observed in the models assuming invariance , (cid:7)(cid:11) 2 ( 11 ) (cid:3) 10 . 31 , 8 . 24 , and 10 . 60 ( all p s (cid:5) . 47 ) , respectively . The WMC contribution to insight ability after accounting for age , personality , anxiety , and motivation ( Analysis 5 ) . In order to test if the strong relationship persisted between WMC and insight ability after accounting for age , current levels of anxiety and motivation , and the personality traits of extraversion , neurot - icism , psychoticism , and openness to experience , in Analysis 5 we aimed to calculate the SEM model in which the latter seven variables would predict the WMC and insight and reasoning ability variables , and the correlation between the WMC and insight and reasoning disturbance terms would reflect the link after the vari - ance accounted for was extracted . First , we computed the CFA model assuming the seven predictors as intercorrelated latent vari - ables . Unfortunately , such a CFA model yielded unacceptable fit , (cid:11) 2 ( 61 ) (cid:3) 268 . 06 , (cid:11) 2 ( 4 . 39 ) , CFI (cid:3) . 852 , RMSEA (cid:3) . 103 [ . 090 – . 116 ] . Inspection of the model revealed that eliminating the extra - version and neuroticism variables ( note that they were not related to creative problem solving in existing literature ) made the fit of this measurement model acceptable , (cid:11) 2 ( 61 ) (cid:3) 268 . 06 , (cid:11) 2 ( 3 . 55 ) , CFI (cid:3) . 928 , RMSEA (cid:3) . 089 [ . 070 – . 110 ] . See Table 8 for the links among its variables . In consequence , we calculated the above mentioned SEM model using age , motivation , anxiety , psychoticism , and open - ness to experience as predictors . Because the hierarchical latent variable of WMC , which was calculated in Analyses 2 through 4 , could not be used as an endogenous variable in this Analysis , we submitted each set of three respective WM measures ( two in the case of updating ) to exploratory factor analysis ( all Eigenvalues (cid:5) 1 . 46 ) , and used the calculated five factors as manifest measures for the WMC factor . The fit of the SEM model ( see Figure 6 ) was also acceptable , (cid:11) 2 ( 226 ) (cid:3) 471 . 81 , (cid:11) 2 ( 2 . 09 ) , CFI (cid:3) . 913 , RMSEA (cid:3) . 058 [ . 050 – . 066 ] . Unsurpris - ingly , age negatively predicted performance on WM , insight , and reasoning tasks ( r (cid:3) (cid:8) . 329 , (cid:8) . 210 , (cid:8) 336 , respectively ; note that all r s above | . 17 | are significant at p (cid:3) . 05 level ) . Also as expected , motivation predicted such performance positively ( r (cid:3) . 223 , . 320 , . 312 , respectively ) . Openness was positively related to both insight problem solving ( r (cid:3) . 358 ) and reasoning ( r (cid:3) . 354 ) but not to WMC . Psychoticism weakly predicted insight problem solving ( r (cid:3) . 172 ) but was unrelated to rea - soning ( r (cid:3) . 012 ) . Anxiety was not significantly related to the three cognitive variables at all ( r s (cid:12) | . 11 | ) . Most importantly , after the influence of age , motivation , anxi - ety , psychoticism , and openness to experience had been partialed out , the residual variances of WMC and insight and reasoning ability still correlated strongly ( from r (cid:3) . 534 to r (cid:3) . 728 ) , losing on average (cid:7) r (cid:3) (cid:8) . 209 from their respective correlations reported in Analysis 2 . This specific observation supports the robustness of relationships among the three cognitive ability variables , which could not be explained away by the most important noncognitive factors . General Discussion In a study of 318 young and middle aged adults , we adminis - tered five several - item tests of insight problem solving , four fluid reasoning tests , and as many as 13 WM tasks assessing the five most important functions of WM . We controlled for age , motiva - tion , anxiety , and the two personality factors that in previous studies were associated with creativity . The insight problems stud - ied showed good convergent validity that allowed for calculation of the insight ability latent variable . One exception was remote associates , which did not share sufficient variance with the other insight ability tests ; this finding questions the validity of remote associates as a measure of insightful thinking ( for similar concerns see Dailey , 1978 ; Lee , Huggins , & Therriault , 2014 ) . Analysis 1 showed that each WM function substantially pre - dicted insight problem solving , although these correlations were weaker than in the case of reasoning . WM functions varied in predictive strength , but the relative advantage of executive control Table 8 Correlations Between Predictors in the Structural Equation Model From Analysis 5 Predictor 1 2 3 4 1 .

We conclude that insight problem solving is related to WM in a general way , and their relationship is not restricted to any particular WM function . Irrespective of which function was used as a predictor , from a quarter ( storage ) to a half of variance ( executive control ) in insight problem solving could be explained . In consequence , Analysis 2 used a general WMC latent variable that loaded each specific WM function , in order to predict insight problem solving versus fluid reasoning . The WMC factor ex - plained 51 . 8 % of insight variance , as well as 87 . 0 % of reasoning variance . Both types of thinking shared above 84 . 6 % of variance ; however , the lion’s share of this common variance was due to WMC . The strong effects of WMC were revealed not only at the insight ability latent variable level and each insight test level , but were also demonstrated for most single items ( insight problems , matchstick equations , remote associates ) . Analysis 3 ruled out a possibility that the strong link between WMC and insight problem solving was driven by the items solved by means of some analytic strategy , for which the solvers did not report the sudden and unexpected subjective experience of realiz - ing the solution . Solutions that did or did not yield such an experience were equally strongly related to WMC . Tables 1 and 3 show that the proportion of correct solutions due to ( reported ) insight , among 17 problems with such data available , was 22 . 6 % ( varying between 5 % and 35 % for particular problems ) . This outcome matches previous reports ( e . g . , Fleck & Weisberg , 2013 ) which suggested that sudden insights in insight problem solving are relatively infrequent . Nevertheless , even if they occur , respec - tive solution rates still strongly depend on WMC . In Analysis 4 , the relationship between WMC and insight prob - lem solving was perfectly linear , with no threshold detected above which this relationship would weaken . Simply speaking , every WMC point counts for insight problem solving ability , exactly as it does for fluid reasoning ( Gignac & Weiss , 2015 ) . This result rejects the possibility that the WMC - insight ability link could rely on a minority of outlier participants . Finally , Analysis 5 demonstrated that the relationship between WMC and insight problem solving remains robust , even after the openness to experience , psychoticism , anxiety , motivation , and age were partialed out . Generally , these variables were weak predictors of insight problem solving and fluid reasoning , in com - parison to WMC as a predictor . As expected , openness to experi - ence predicted up to 10 % of the variance in both insight and reasoning ability ( but not in WMC ) . A significant but weak link was also replicated between insight problem solving and psychoti - cism , supporting the renowned theories linking psychoticism and creativity ( Eysenck , 1993 ) . That link was found neither for fluid reasoning nor for WMC .

The present study may thus be criticized as measuring insight problem solving in a way not representative of this type of problem . In this section , we discuss several points of such a potential criticism ( some of them expressed by reviewers of our already published articles ) . For example , one may argue that the CFA / SEM methods applied to many multiitem tests are so powerful that they estimate overly strong correlations between phenomena that might actually be much more weakly correlated ( e . g . , Ackerman , Beier , & Boyle , 2005 ) . The latent variable calculated , instead of truly representing insight problem solv - ing , might extract some artificial factor out of many problems so idiosyncratic as to lack meaningful commonality . For instance , such a factor might reflect a strategy that a person tended to use in most of the problems , her / his particular way of understanding the instructions ( e . g . , how easily one was trapped by misleading cues ) , or her / his task commitment . This possible argument may be rebutted in three ways . First , other noncognitive phenomena included in our models , espe - cially motivation , did not yield substantial correlations regardless of also being latent variables . So , just calculating a latent variable does not suffice to account for the almost perfect correlations reported for the cognitive factors . Second , when the consecutive measures of each ability were just averaged , the mean score of the five insight tests still strongly correlated with both the WMC ( r (cid:3) . 562 ) and reasoning ability ( r (cid:3) . 666 ) mean scores . Third , even when we averaged scores on the first items of each test ( i . e . , single problems attempted with no preexposure to problems of that type ) , such a 5 - item insight measure still substantially predicted both the WMC ( r (cid:3) . 456 ) and reasoning ( r (cid:3) . 550 ) summary scores . In sum , the factor analysis cannot take the credit for the reported strong correlations between insight problem solving and WMC ( and fluid reasoning ) . However , although fully convergent with the CFA / SEM analyses , unlike them , the second and third method above underestimated the true relationship between WMC and insight , due to limited reliability of insight tests . For example , the reliability of one 25 - item compound ( a “metatest” ) of insight problem solving ( including all the verbal , spatial , math , and matchstick items , with remote associates skipped because of their low validity ) was imperfect ( (cid:9) (cid:3) . 81 ) . Analogous reliability ( (cid:9) (cid:3) . 89 ) of the WMC compound ( with single tasks serving as “items” ) was higher but also below unity . So , even if both con - structs had been perfectly isomorphic ( “real” r (cid:3) 1 . 0 ) , the imperfect reliability of their measures would have made their correlation only r (cid:3) . 849 ( i . e . , the square root for . 81 times . 89 ) . CFA / SEM helps to resolve this problem . Another possible line of criticism might argue that the require - ment for continuous monitoring of participants’ thoughts in order to report whether insight did or did not occur might promote a more analytic way of problem solving ( more reflection , more metacognition ) . This argument cannot stand , as the math problem performance that required no monitoring and had been adminis - tered before the other insight tests were administered correlated with WM more strongly ( r (cid:3) . 497 ) than the monitored verbal ( r (cid:3) . 375 ) and spatial problems ( r (cid:3) . 465 ) . So , the present results cannot be attributed to the need to report insights . Many problems of each type were administered ; this could also be criticized because of possible learning effects that might have favored high - WMC participants . For example , facing a sequence of problems containing a similar hidden clue ( e . g . , each math problem required a part of its description to be ignored , enabling a simpler calculation ) , high - WMC people might recognize the clue more quickly . However , this argument can be rebutted on three grounds . First , the strong correlation between WMC and the initial items of each insight test , as well as the observation that solvers of such items had a significantly larger WMC than nonsolvers ( see Tables 1 through 3 ) , suggest that performance on even the initial items before any learning could occur was substantially associated with WMC . Second , having already learned how to deal with problems of a given type , the participants would be unlikely to report insights . So , it might be reasonable to assume that solutions with reported insights did not result from learning ; nevertheless , they substantially correlated with WMC . Third , another study by us ( Chuderski & Jastrze˛bski , 2017 ) divided the insight problems into two separate sessions , each comprising three classical prob - lems and four matchstick equations . If learning had occurred , its effects should have been more pronounced in the second session . However , the WMC correlations of insight scores were perfectly comparable between the sessions ( r s were stable between . 30 and . 35 , irrespective of a session and a problem type ) . So , learning is unlikely to matter for the WM - insight ability link . The latter study also ruled out any influence on the respective correlation strengths of whether the insight problem instructions insisted on the partic - ipants thinking in flexible and nonstandard ways ( as in the present study ) or just required “following test instructions . ” Finally , the amount of time allowed did not affect these correlation strengths ( no difference between speeded and unspeeded sessions ) . Given all the above reservations , we claim that the present psycho - metric approach to insight still captured the most important aspects of insight problem solving , comparably to single - problem studies in experimental settings . At the same time , the use of multiitems tests , latent variables and maximum likelihood estimation helped to correct biases resulting from limited reliability and increased idiosyncrasy of the single - problem studies ( e . g . , our use of the insight latent variable helped to account for low reliability of our spatial and verbal classical insight problems ) . We suggest that valid conclusions on the true relationship between WMC and insight problem solving can only be drawn from the CFA / SEM or equivalent methods . How can WM Contribute to Insight Problem Solving ? Above half of the variance in insight problem solving explained here by WMC constitutes a strong refutation of the recent theo - retical claims ( e . g . , Wiley & Jarosz , 2012 ) assuming that WM is unrelated , or even negatively related , to insight problem solving . ( For a methodological critique of these claims , see Chuderski & Jastrze˛bski , 2017 ) . Specifically , these claims assume that insights result from weakened executive control , leading to a faster divert - ing of attention from the initial ineffective problem representation , and a less constrained , broader search for alternatives in long - term memory , and thus high WMC ( associated with strong control over attention and memory ) hinders insight problem solving . Although such claims are rooted in popular views on creative thinking ( Guilford , 1967 ; Mednick , 1962 ) , the strong positive links between WMC and insight problem solving reported here , especially pro - T h i s do c u m e n t i s c opy r i gh t e d by t h e A m e r i ca n P s y c ho l og i ca l A ss o c i a ti on o r on e o f it s a lli e d pub li s h e r s .

In contrast , the present data strongly imply that processing of insight problems relies substan - tially on multiple components of WM , both in the case of reported insights and solutions provided without such insights . Moreover , the current study suggests that even if the processing of insight problems can sometimes be facilitated by defocused attention and broad memory search , it is highly unlikely that for such a reason high - WMC people lose their general cognitive advantage over low - WMC ones . Even if the beneficial effects of defocused attention for insight problem solving exist , the latter will still be facilitated by higher WMC . For instance , the dynamic interaction between associa - tive exploration of the state space and its systematic generation , postulated by several models of problem solving ( e . g . , Finke , 1996 ; Necka , 2003 ; Simonton , 2015 ) , allows that , even if high - WMC peo - ple permanently focused attention and directed memory search ( which might hinder their hitting upon good initial ideas ) , they could catch up during systematic generation of the final solution . Moreover , even assuming that most WM task scores reflect controlled attention and directed retrievals , people who score high need not display such attention / retrievals all the time . Instead , high WMC may be rooted in the flexible adjustment of WM to processing demands , such as zoom - ing WM in when blocking distractors , but zooming WM out in order to grasp many elements at once ( Cowan , 2005 ) . High - WMC people can be better in adjusting their WM than are low - WMC individuals : although they are able to more effectively focus their WM in the WM tasks , they may also better de - focus WM when some stages of insight problem solving require less constrained operation of attention and mem - ory . What can the knowledge of its strong links with WMC and rea - soning tell about insight problem solving ? The most plausible expla - nation suggests that finding solutions for insight problems is sup - ported by the same well - defined incremental processes that also underpin analytical ( noninsight ) problem solving ( Perkins , 1981 ; Weisberg , 2015 ; Weisberg & Alba , 1981 ) . An analytical problem can be described as a discrepancy between the starting and goal states within the problem’s state space . A solution is the path from the start to the goal . Often , the solution can be just retrieved from memory ( the same or an analogous problem has been solved in the past ) or potential solutions can be quickly generated and tested ( the state space is small ) . However , in nontrivial problems no memorized solution is available , and the state space is so huge that without intelligent heuristics ( e . g . , hill - climbing , means - ends analysis ; Newell & Simon , 1972 ) , allowing one to explore only the most promising paths , its search results in combinatorial explosion . The primary role played by WM in problem solving was elucidated by its numerous computa - tional models ( e . g . , Altmann & Trafton , 2002 ; Anderson , 2005 ; Laird , 1929 / 2012 ) , with WM being responsible for storing the subgoals and subproducts during the search / generation of solutions across the prob - lem’s state space , as well as for directing that process ( via goal representations ) . WM is also the mental place for binding the crucial pieces of the solution together , either spatially ( Lyon , Gunzelmann , & Gluck , 2008 ; Ragni & Knauff , 2013 ) or relationally ( Chuderski & Andrelczyk , 2015 ; Hummel & Holyoak , 2003 ) . Existing studies re - ported substantial positive links between WM and performance on problems that required the search of state space ( Gilhooly & Fioratou , 2009 ; Zook , Davalos , Delosh , & Davis , 2004 ) , complex calcula - tions ( Holmes & Adams , 2006 ) , combinatorial operations ( Tsapar - lis , 2005 ) , and the control over dynamical environment ( Bühner , Kröner , & Ziegler , 2008 ; Schweizer , Wüstenberg , & Greiff , 2013 ) . The same positive relationship with WMC can thus be expected in the case of insight problems if they also depend on a similar search of state space , calculations , combinatorial operations , as well as plan - ning and visualization ( MacGregor et al . , 2001 ) . Although the present data evidently support the large common - ality of performance on insight and analytical problems , two results seem to question their complete equivalence . First , insight ability was more weakly associated with WMC than was reason - ing . WMC explained almost all the variance in reasoning , while it left almost half the variance in insight problem solving unex - plained . Second , the residual variance in reasoning , which could be ascribed to the learning of proper problem solving strategies and heuristics from previous items ( Chuderski , 2016 ; Hayes , Petrov , & Sederberg , 2015 ) , only weakly correlated with residual variance in insight problem solving . The relative independence of both resid - ual variances suggests that insight problem solving requires spe - cific strategies and heuristics beyond those involved in reasoning . Previously , one of us ( Chuderski , 2014 ) proposed that insight problem solving can best be described as “nothing special with special add - ons” . In light of the present results as well as the PM theory ( MacGregor et al . , 2001 ) and the hybrid account of problem solving ( Fleck & Weisberg , 2013 ) , the “nothing special” in this framework refers to general - domain cognitive processes , shared with analytical thinking , that include selective attention , memory access , learning , analogical retrieval and mapping , problem space search , and transfor - mation of mental representations ( also using imagery ) . All these processes are strongly dependent on active maintenance and control of information exerted by the WM system . The special add - ons comprise the set of strategies , heuristics , and abilities specific for insight problem solving . Such add - ons can , for instance , encompass a tendency to frequently check whether a given approach to a problem at hand can effectively lead to its solution ( as suggested by the PM theory ) , an ability to decouple from this approach ( if it is unpromis - ing ) and to restart the problem solving process ( as suggested by the hybrid theory ) , as well as a general strategy for trying out as many diverse approaches as possible . Most likely , people differ in the extent , to which they employ such add - ons , because of many reasons , including previous experience , training , and personality ( psychoticism ) . Nevertheless , the add - ons contribute to a minor portion of variance in insight problem solving , as compared with general - domain processes underpinned by WM . Moreover , the add - ons themselves constitute ana - lytic processes ( high - order ones ; Fleck & Weisberg , 2013 ) , and need not imply any role for associative , unconstrained , holistic , and intuitive think - ing in insight problem solving ability . Conclusion This comprehensive psychometric study included a solid battery of insight problems , fluid reasoning tests , and working memory tasks , and a large sample , as well as adequate methods of data analysis . The findings show that WMC explained above half of the variance in insight problem solving ability as well as almost all of its isomor - phism to fluid reasoning ability . Analyses excluded the possibility that the strong link between WMC and insight problem solving might T h i s do c u m e n t i s c opy r i gh t e d by t h e A m e r i ca n P s y c ho l og i ca l A ss o c i a ti on o r on e o f it s a lli e d pub li s h e r s .

These results thus contradict the popular view as well as neo - Gestalt claims on the special , sudden , and holistic nature of insight , and are in line with the nothing - special account . The strong association of in - sight problem solving with WM implies that this type of thinking primarily results from typical mental operations , important also for analytical thinking , which are carried out by the relatively simple and domain - general mechanisms of WM that are responsible for the maintenance , retrieval , transformation , and control of information in a broad range of thinking tasks . The special - process theories of insight made much ado about the uniqueness of Aha ! experience within human cognition ; however , it seems that if anything is unique about insight problem solving ( i . e . , add - ons ) , it is marginal as compared with the standard machinery of WM . In contrast , the present results speak for a relatively uniform structure of human cognitive abilities , with WM playing the central role in various intellectual tasks . References Ackerman , P .
