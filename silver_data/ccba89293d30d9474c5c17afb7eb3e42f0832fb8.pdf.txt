The Arp2 / 3 protein complex has been impli - cated in the control of actin polymerization in cells . The human complex consists of seven subunits which in - clude the actin related proteins Arp2 and Arp3 , and five others referred to as p41 - Arc , p34 - Arc , p21 - Arc , p20 - Arc , and p16 - Arc ( Arp complex ) . We have deter - mined the predicted amino acid sequence of all seven subunits . Each has homologues in diverse eukaryotes , implying that the structure and function of the complex has been conserved through evolution . Human Arp2 and Arp3 are very similar to family members from other species . p41 - Arc is a new member of the Sop2 family of WD ( tryptophan and aspartate ) repeat – con - taining proteins and may be posttranslationally modi - fied , suggesting that it may be involved in regulating the activity and / or localization of the complex . p34 - Arc , p21 - Arc , p20 - Arc , and p16 - Arc define novel protein families . We sought to evaluate the function of the Arp2 / 3 complex in cells by determining its intracellular distribution . Arp3 , p34 - Arc , and p21 - Arc were local - ized to the lamellipodia of stationary and locomoting fi - broblasts , as well to Listeria monocytogenes assembled actin tails . They were not detected in cellular bundles of actin filaments . Taken together with the ability of the Arp2 / 3 complex to induce actin polymerization , these observations suggest that the complex promotes actin assembly in lamellipodia and may participate in lamelli - podial protrusion . T he protrusion of the cell membrane is fundamental to cell shape change and locomotion . Actin poly - merization plays a critical role in this process . The leading edge of motile cells is dominated by thin actin - rich structures called lamellipodia , which exhibit highly dy - namic behavior characterized by rapid extension and re - traction . In lamellipodia , actin filaments are oriented al - most exclusively with their fast growing barbed ends facing the membrane ( for review see Small , 1988 ) . Actin polymerization adjacent to the membrane is coupled to protrusion , and may provide the driving force for this pro - cess ( Hill and Kirschner , 1982 ; Mogilner and Oster , 1996 ) . Many aspects of the mechanism of lamellipodial protru - sion are echoed in the intracellular motility of certain bac - terial and viral pathogens ( for review see Cossart , 1995 ; Theriot , 1995 ; Higley and Way , 1997 ) . Of these , the most extensively studied is the bacterium Listeria monocytoge - nes . L . monocytogenes move in arcing trajectories within cell cytoplasm , forming cometlike tails composed of actin filaments oriented with their barbed ends towards the bac - terium ( Tilney et al . , 1992 ) . Actin polymerization at the bacterial surface is tightly coupled to propulsion ( Sanger et al . , 1992 ; Theriot et al . , 1992 ) , suggesting that it provides the motile force . Although a role for myosins in bacterial propulsion and lamellipodial protrusion cannot be defini - tively ruled out , the myosin inhibitor butanedione mon - oxime ( BDM ) which inhibits classic myosin - driven pro - cesses such as muscle contraction , does not affect either process ( Cramer and Mitchison , 1995 ) . The central role of actin polymerization in both lamelli - podial protrusion and L . monocytogenes propulsion sug - gests that the underlying mechanisms for promoting poly - merization and generating force may be similar in both processes . Since L . monocytogenes motility can be recon - stituted in cell extracts ( Theriot et al . , 1994 ; Laurent and Carlier , 1997 ; Welch et al . , 1997 ) understanding the bio - chemical mechanisms that underlie this process has proven more tractable . We have recently purified a multiprotein complex from human platelets that induces actin polymerization at the L . monocytogenes cell surface and mediates bacterial mo - tility ( Welch et al . , 1997 ) . This complex contains actin - related proteins in the Arp2 and Arp3 families and there - fore was named the Arp2 / 3 complex . In addition to Arp2 Please address all correspondence to Matthew D .

Fax : ( 415 ) 476 - 5233 . e - mail : welch @ cgl . ucsf . edu The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 138 , 1997 376 and Arp3 , the human complex consists of 41 / 40 - , 34 - , 21 - , 20 - , and 16 - kD subunits , all present in approximately equal stoichiometry . These subunits are referred to as p41 - Arc , p34 - Arc , p21 - Arc , p20 - Arc , and p16 - Arc ( Arp com - plex ) . A similar Arp2 / 3 complex was first discovered by profilin affinity chromatography of cell extracts from Acanthamoeba castellanii ( Machesky et al . , 1994 ) . In addi - tion , Arp2 and Arp3 proteins appear to be found in all eu - karyotes ( for reviews see Frankel and Mooseker , 1996 ; Mullins et al . , 1996 ) , suggesting that the Arp2 / 3 complex itself has been conserved through evolution . However , the molecular identities of all but one of the non - Arp subunits have remained undetermined . The exception is p41 - Arc , which contains WD ( tryptophan and aspartate ) repeats and is similar to proteins in the Sop2 family ( suppressor of profilin ; Machesky et al . , 1994 ; Balasubramanian et al . , 1996 ; McCollum et al . , 1996 ) . The mechanism by which the Arp2 / 3 complex promotes actin polymerization remains enigmatic . Structural model - ing of Arp2 and Arp3 proteins has led to the prediction that the Arp2 / 3 complex serves as a seed for the nucle - ation of actin assembly ( Kelleher et al . , 1995 ) . Thus far , only filament binding and bundling activity have been ob - served in vitro ( Mullins et al . , 1997 ) . Despite the lack of detailed information regarding mechanism , several lines of evidence indicate that the Arp2 / 3 complex is important for actin function in cells . Subunits of the A . castellanii Arp2 / 3 complex colocalize with actin in ameba , particularly at sites of dynamic actin assembly at the cell cortex ( Ma - chesky et al . , 1994 ; Kelleher et al . , 1995 ; Mullins et al . , 1997 ) . The Saccharomyces cerevisiae Arp2 and Schizosac - charomyces pombe Arp3 proteins are also localized to cor - tical actin structures . Deletions of their corresponding genes are lethal , and temperature - sensitive mutations cause defects in actin function ( Lees - Miller et al . , 1992 ; Schwob and Martin , 1992 ; McCollum et al . , 1996 ; Moreau et al . , 1996 ) . In this study we have begun to explore the function of the Arp2 / 3 complex in animal cells . We have determined the complete amino acid sequence of all seven subunits of the human complex . Each protein has homologues in diverse eukaryotic organisms , indicating that the subunit composi - tion , and most likely the function of the Arp2 / 3 complex , have been conserved through evolution . The ability of the complex to promote actin assembly and mediate L . mono - cytogenes motility suggests that it may play a correspond - ing role in cellular lamellipodia . In fact , multiple subunits of the complex are localized to L . monocytogenes assem - bled actin clouds and tails as well as to lamellipodia in sta - tionary and motile fibroblast cells . These subunits are ab - sent from less dynamic actin filament bundles in fibroblasts . Our observations further strengthen the analogy between L . monocytogenes motility and lamellipodial protrusion and suggest that the Arp2 / 3 complex plays a central role in both processes . Materials and Methods Protein and DNA Sequence Determination To determine the amino acid sequence of the non - Arp polypeptide sub - units of the Arp2 / 3 complex , the proteins were first subjected to SDS - PAGE , and then blotted to polyvinylidinedifluoride ( PVDF ) 1 membrane ( Applied Biosystems , Inc . , Foster City , CA ) . Proteins were identified by staining with Ponceau S ( Hirano and Watanabe , 1990 ) . The PVDF - immo - bilized proteins were reduced , S - carboxymethylated , and digested in situ with Achromobacter protease I and endoproteinase Asp - N ( Iwamatsu , 1992 ) . Digested peptides were chromatographed by reverse - phase HPLC using a Wakosil - II AR C18 300 Å column ( 2 . 0 (cid:51) 150 mm ; Wako Pure Chemical Industries , Ltd . , Osaka , Japan ) . Amino acid sequencing was performed with a gas - phase sequencer ( model PPSQ - 10 ; Shimadzu Corp . , Tokyo , Japan ) . To identify cDNA clones encoding the individual subunits of the hu - man Arp2 / 3 complex , the peptide sequences were used to search the EMBL / GenBank / DDBJ database of expressed sequence tags ( dbEST ) . The following cDNA clones were identified in the database and were ob - tained from Genome Systems , Inc . ( St . Louis , MO ) ( clone Id numbers are indicated ) : Arp3 , 328293 ; Arp2 , 587272 ; p41 - Arc , 527050 ; p34 - Arc , 547253 ; p21 - Arc , 326562 ; p20 - Arc , 187446 ; and p16 - Arc , 300395 . In addi - tion , a cDNA - encoding p34 - Arc was isolated from a (cid:108) phage Uni ZAP HeLa cell cDNA expression library ( Stratagene , La Jolla , CA ) by screen - ing with anti - p34 antibody using standard procedures . The DNA sequence of each clone was determined by sequencing both strands ( performed by the Biomolecular Resource Center Sequencing Facility at the University of California , San Francisco , CA ) . Protein Expression , Antibody Production , and Immunoblotting Polyclonal anti - peptide antibodies that recognize p34 - Arc were generated by immunizing rabbits ( Berkeley Antibody Co . , Richmond , CA ) with the synthetic peptide ( C ) KVFMQEFKEGRRASHTAPQVLFSHRE , corre - sponding to amino acids 179 – 204 of the protein . An amino - terminal cys - teine was added for sulfhydryl coupling . Peptide conjugation and antibody affinity purification were carried out as previously described ( Sawin et al . , 1992 ) . Antibodies were concentrated by dialysis into 10 mM MOPS , pH 6 . 8 , 150 mM NaCl , 35 % glycerol . To generate polyclonal antibodies that recognize p21 - Arc ( formerly re - ferred to as the 23 - kD subunit ; Welch et al . , 1997 ) , the corresponding gene was amplified by PCR and cloned into pGEX - 3X ( Smith and Johnson , 1988 ) to create a glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) fusion protein . Purified GST fusion protein was used to immunize rabbits ( Berkeley Antibody Co . ) . An affinity matrix for purification of anti - p21 antibodies was created by cleaving p21 - Arc from the GST - p21 fusion protein using Factor Xa ( New England Biolabs Inc . , Beverly , MA ) and covalently coupling it to af - figel - 10 ( Bio Rad Laboratories , Hercules , CA ) . Antibody affinity purifica - tion was performed using standard procedures ( Harlow and Lane , 1988 ) . Antibodies were concentrated by dialysis into 10 mM MOPS , pH 6 . 8 , 150 mM NaCl , 35 % glycerol . Immunoblotting was carried out using affinity - purified anti - Arp3 ( 0 . 4 (cid:109) g / ml ) , anti - p34 ( 0 . 04 (cid:109) g / ml ) , and anti - p21 ( 0 . 6 (cid:109) g / ml ) antibodies using the ECL system ( Amersham Corp . , Arlington Heights , IL ) . Cell Culture and Immunofluorescence Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts were grown in DME - H16 medium with 10 % FBS , penicillin , and streptomycin . To create a confluent layer of cells for the wounding experiment , cells were plated at a density of 3 (cid:51) 10 4 cells per ml onto 22 - mm diam coverslips and allowed to grow to confluence . A wound was created using a plastic pipette tip . HeLa cells were grown in DME - H16 medium with 10 % FBS , penicillin , and streptomycin . Cells were plated onto glass coverslips 1 – 2 d before immunofluorescence experi - ments . Infection of HeLa cells with L . monocytogenes strain 10403S was carried out as previously described ( Theriot et al . , 1994 ) . Locomoting fi - broblasts were prepared from heart explants from 7 - d - old chick embryos as described in Cramer et al . , 1997 . Cells were plated onto glass coverslips treated with 1 mg / ml poly - d - lysine ( Sigma Chemical Co . , St . Louis , MO ) , and 125 (cid:109) g / ml matrigel ( Collaborative Research , Inc . , Waltham , MA ) and were grown in DME - H16 medium with 10 % FBS and 10 % heat - inacti - vated chicken serum , penicillin , and streptomycin . Immunofluorescence experiments were carried out within 20 h of plating , which was shown by Cramer et al . ( 1997 ) to be optimal for observing rapidly locomoting cells . For immunofluorescence experiments , cells were extracted for 30 s in 1 .

Cells were fixed in CBS plus 4 % formaldehyde for 20 min followed by (cid:50) 20 (cid:56) C methanol for 3 min ( methanol fixation was necessary to observe staining with the anti - p34 and anti - p21 antibodies , indicating that they rec - ognize only denatured protein ) . Indirect immunofluorescence was per - formed using affinity - purified rabbit anti - Arp3 ( 4 (cid:109) g / ml ) , anti - p34 ( 0 . 4 (cid:109) g / ml ) , anti - p21 ( 6 (cid:109) g / ml ) and mouse anti - actin ( 5 (cid:109) g / ml ; Boehringer Mann - heim Biochemicals , Indianapolis , IN ) primary antibodies , and Texas red – conjugated goat anti – rabbit and FITC - conjugated goat anti – mouse sec - ondary antibodies ( Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories , Inc . , West Grove , PA ) . Fluorescent phalloidin staining of filamentous actin was car - ried out with 1 (cid:109) g / ml FITC - conjugated phalloidin ( Sigma Chemical Co . ) . Photomicrographs were taken using a cooled CCD camera ( Princeton Sci - entific Instruments , Inc . , Princeton , NJ ) on a Nikon Optiphot - 2 micro - scope . Images were handled digitally using Adobe Photoshop ( Adobe Systems Inc . , Mountain View , CA ) . Construction of Arp3 - Green Fluorescent Protein Fusion and Cell Transfection The gene encoding Arp3 was isolated by PCR and was cloned into pEGFP - N1 ( Clontech , Palo Alto , CA ) to create a fusion of Arp3 with green fluorescent protein ( EGFP ) attached to its carboxy terminus ( pArp3 - EGFP ) . ( The DNA sequence of the Arp3 gene isolated by PCR was identical to the sequence of the Arp3 cDNA clone . ) pArp3 - EGFP was introduced into HeLa cells using calcium phosphate – mediated trans - fection as described previously ( Heald et al . , 1993 ) . To visualize Arp3 - EGPF in L . monocytogenes – infected cells , HeLa cells were infected 1 d after transfection . For fluorescence experiments , cells were extracted in CBS with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 and 1 (cid:109) g / ml phalloidin for 30 s , and then fixed in CBS with 3 . 2 % formaldehyde for 10 min . To visualize polymer - ized actin , cells were stained with 1 (cid:109) g / ml 5 - carboxytetramethyl rhodamine phalloidin ( Sigma Chemical Co . ) for 2 min . Cells were photo - graphed as described above except that a blocking filter was used to elimi - nate bleed through from the rhodamine to the fluorescein channel . Results The Sequence of Human Arp2 and Arp3 To further understand the role of the Arp2 / 3 complex in the control of actin assembly in cells , we determined the predicted amino acid sequences of all of the subunits of the human protein complex . Using peptide sequence in - formation ( Welch et al . , 1997 ) to search the EMBL / Gen - Bank / DDBJ dbEST we obtained and sequenced full - length human cDNA clones encoding Arp2 and Arp3 ( these sequence data are available from EMBL / GenBank / DDBJ under accession numbers AF006082 for Arp2 and AF - 006083 for Arp3 ) . The Arp2 cDNA encodes a pre - dicted protein of 394 amino acids with a molecular mass of 45 kD ( 43 kD as determined by SDS - PAGE ; Welch et al . , 1997 ) . Human Arp2 is 99 % identical to chicken Arp2 ( these data are available from EMBL / GenBank / DDBJ under accession number X73971 ) , and is also highly simi - lar to Arp2 proteins from Drosophila melanogaster ( 81 % identical ; accession number X78486 ) , Caenorhabditis ele - gans ( 76 % identical ; accession number Z71181 ) , A . castel - lanii ( 72 % identical ; accession number U29609 ) , and S . cerevisiae ( 67 % identical ; accession number X61502 ) . Hu - man Arp3 is 418 amino acids in length and has a predicted molecular mass of 47 kD ( 50 kD as determined by SDS - PAGE ; Welch et al . , 1997 ) . It is identical in sequence to bovine Arp3 ( accession number D12816 ) , and shows ex - tensive similarity to Arp3 proteins from D . melanogaster ( 80 % identical ; accession number X71789 ) , A . castellanii ( 70 % identical ; accession number U29610 ) , Dictyostelium discoideum ( 69 % identical ; accession number Z46418 ) , Neurospora crassa ( 59 % identical ; accession number U79737 ) , S . pombe ( 59 % identical ; accession number M81068 ) , and S . cerevisiae ( 58 % identical ; accession num - ber Z49565 ) . p41 - Arc Is a Member of the Sop2 Family of WD Repeat Containing Proteins We also searched the dbEST database using peptide se - quences derived from the five non - Arp subunits of the Arp2 / 3 complex . Full - length cDNA clones encoding each subunit were identified , and their DNA sequences were determined . The predicted polypeptides encoded by these clones are similar in sequence to proteins from a wide vari - ety of eukaryotes . Based on its high degree of sequence similarity , the p41 - Arc subunit of the platelet Arp2 / 3 complex is a new mem - ber of the Sop2 family of proteins . As is shown in Fig . 1 A , p41 - Arc is 67 % identical to the previously identified hu - man Sop2 protein Sop2Hs ( Balasubramanian et al . , 1996 ) , making them similar but distinct members of the same family . p41 - Arc is also similar to Sop2 proteins from D . melanogaster ( 49 % identical ; accession number L39625 ) , S . pombe ( 37 % identical ; accession number Y08998 ) , and S . cerevisiae ( 34 % identical ; accession number Z36103 ) . Previous evidence has suggested that Sop2 family proteins encode the 41 - kD subunit of the Arp2 / 3 complex . The ca - nonical member of this family , S . pombe Sop2p , associates with Arp3 in a protein complex , and mutations in the sop2 and arp3 genes interact genetically . Moreover , Sop2 pro - teins contain sequences that are similar to peptide se - quences from the 40 - kD subunit of the A . castellanii Arp2 / 3 complex ( Balasubramanian et al . , 1996 ) . Like previously identified Sop2 family proteins , human p41 - Arc contains WD repeat sequences ( also known as (cid:98) - transducin re - peats ) . We identified seven potential WD repeats in p41 - Arc ( Fig . 1 A ) that correspond to the consensus sequence described by Neer et al . ( 1994 ) with one to five mis - matches . These repeats are highly conserved in both se - quence and position within p41 - Arc and Sop2Hs . The 41 - and 40 - kD subunits of the platelet Arp2 / 3 com - plex ( Fig . 2 , far left lane ) , which differ slightly in their mo - bility by SDS - PAGE , are different versions of the p41 - Arc polypeptide . Digestion of p41 and p40 with Achromobacter protease I and endoproteinase Asp - N produced identical peptide maps by reverse phase HPLC ( not shown ) . This suggests that p41 and p40 may differ in their state of post - translational modification . Furthermore , this indicates that the platelet Arp2 / 3 complex contains seven polypep - tides , identical to the number found in the A . castellanii complex . Both p41 and p40 are the only subunits of the plate - let Arp2 / 3 complex that are present in substoichiometric quantities , while the other six subunits are represented in slightly larger and roughly equal amounts ( Welch et al . , 1997 ) . However , when summed together , the quantity of the p41 and p40 is stoichiometric with that of the other subunits . This indicates that the seven polypeptide sub - units of the complex are present in a 1 : 1 : 1 : 1 : 1 : 1 : 1 stoichi - ometry , similar to that found in the A . castellanii Arp2 / 3 complex ( Machesky et al . , 1994 ; Mullins et al . , 1997 ) . The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 138 , 1997 378 p34 - Arc , p21 - Arc , p20 - Arc , and p16 - Arc Define Novel Protein Families The four other subunits of the human Arp2 / 3 complex— p34 - Arc , p21 - Arc , p20 - Arc , and p16 - Arc ( formerly the 34 - , 23 - , 22 - , and 19 - kD subunits as determined by SDS - PAGE ; Welch et al . , 1997 ) —are similar to proteins from diverse eukaryotic organisms . However , they do not share similarity with any proteins of known function . These therefore define four novel protein families , which are shown in Fig . 1 B . The p34 - Arc family is comprised of the human and S . cerevisiae proteins ( 34 % identical ) . Further - more , a region in p34 - Arc is similar in sequence to a pep - tide from 35 - kD subunit of the A . castellanii complex ( Fig . 1 C ) . A partial sequence of human p34 - Arc had previously been determined and its gene maps to chromosome 13 in the BRCA2 region ( Couch et al . , 1996 ) . Like p34 - Arc , p21 - Arc has a single homologue in S . cerevisiae ( 45 % iden - tical ; Fig . 1 B ) and contains a region similar to a peptide in the 18 - kD subunit of the A . castellanii complex ( Fig . 1 C ) . The p20 - Arc family has members in multiple organisms ( Fig . 1 B ) including C . elegans ( 73 % identical in its amino - terminal 168 amino acids ) , S . pombe ( 68 % identical ) , and S . cerevisiae ( 67 % identical ) . In addition , it contains a se - quence that is similar to the 19 - kD subunit of the A . castel - lanii complex ( Fig . 1 C ) . Finally , p16 - Arc resembles pro - teins in C . elegans ( 34 % identical ) , S . pombe ( 26 % identical ) , and S . cerevisiae ( 21 % identical ) . The S . cerevisiae proteins that share sequence similarity with human p34 - Arc , p21 - Arc , p20 - Arc , and p16 - Arc have recently been shown to be components of the yeast Arp2 / 3 complex ( Winter et al . , 1997 ) . Although the sequences of these subunits have not pro - vided clues to their potential function in the Arp2 / 3 com - plex , we have used the sequence information as well as the cloned genes to generate reagents to probe the function of the complex in cells . We have raised polyclonal antibodies to a GST - p21 fusion protein and to a peptide from p34 - Arc . Affinity - purified antibodies recognize p21 - Arc and p34 - Arc in the pure Arp2 / 3 complex ( not shown ) , and spe - cifically recognize 21 - and 34 - kD proteins in whole cell ex - tracts made from a variety of mammalian and avian cell types ( Fig . 2 ) . In addition , we have taken advantage of the previously described anti - Arp3 antibody ( Welch et al . , 1997 ) , which specifically recognizes Arp3 in the same cell Figure 1 .

Welch et al . Arp2 / 3 Complex Sequence and Localization 379 extracts ( Fig . 2 ) . Together , these reagents provide a means of examining the function of the Arp2 / 3 complex by deter - mining its intracellular distribution . Arp3 , p34 - Arc , and p21 - Arc Are Localized to L . monocytogenes Assembled Actin Tails The Arp2 / 3 complex promotes the assembly of actin fila - ments at the surface of L . monocytogenes . Moreover , the Arp3 subunit of the complex is localized to the actin tails assembled by moving intracellular bacteria and to actin clouds surrounding stationary bacteria ( Welch et al . , 1997 ) . To confirm that other subunits of the Arp2 / 3 com - plex exhibit the same localization pattern , we carried out immunofluorescence experiments on L . monocytogenes – infected HeLa cells using anti - p34 and anti - p21 antibodies . As is shown in Fig . 3 , A and C , both p34 - Arc and p21 - Arc are localized to L . monocytogenes assembled actin clouds , and throughout tails with a distribution that mirrors that of Arp3 ( Welch et al . , 1997 ; and see below ) and polymer - ized actin ( Fig . 3 , B and D ) . Punctate cytoplasmic staining also was evident , and was reduced by briefly pre - extract - ing cells with detergent in the presence of phalloidin to stabilize actin structures ( see Materials and Methods ) . To further confirm the observed localization pattern , we created a tagged Arp3 with green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) at its carboxy terminus . We chose to create this par - ticular fusion because S . cerevisiae Arp3 tagged at its car - boxy terminus can complement a null mutation in the ARP3 gene ( Winter et al . , 1997 ) . HeLa cells were trans - fected with pArp3 - EGFP plasmid DNA , and 1 d later were infected with L . monocytogenes . Arp3 - GFP fluores - cence was observed in actin clouds and tails with a distri - bution indistinguishable from that seen by immunofluo - rescence ( Fig . 3 E ; actin localization in F ) . GFP alone did not localize to actin clouds or tails ( not shown ) . As was seen in the immunofluorescence experiments , cytoplasmic Arp3 - GFP fluorescence was always apparent , even in cells expressing lower levels of the fusion protein . A brief pre - extraction of the cells before fixation significantly reduced this cytoplasmic background . The Arp2 / 3 Complex Is Localized to Lamellipodia in Stationary Cells The actin - based motility of L . monocytogenes may be mechanistically similar to actin - driven cellular movements such as the protrusion of lamellipodia . To evaluate whether the Arp2 / 3 complex may be involved in actin polymeriza - tion – driven membrane protrusion , we determined its in - tracellular distribution . We observed the localization of Arp2 / 3 complex subunits in a variety of tissue culture lines by immunofluorescence . Mouse Swiss 3T3 fibroblast cells gave the most consistent results , although a similar stain - ing pattern was evident in all cell lines tested ( including human HeLa epithelial - like cells and mouse MC7 3T3 fi - broblasts ) . As is shown in Fig . 4 , Arp3 ( A ) , p34 - Arc ( C ) , and p21 - Arc ( E ) were distributed throughout the thin ac - tin - rich lamellipodia at the edges of Swiss 3T3 cells ( actin staining in the same cells is shown in Fig . 3 B , D , and F ) . Staining was not observed along the entire margin of the cell , but was confined to lamellipodia ( Figs . 4 and 5 ) . Strik - ingly , other actin - containing structures such as stress fibers and focal adhesions were not stained . The punctate cyto - plasmic staining pattern was especially prominent in thicker regions of the cell in the vicinity of the nucleus ( Fig . 5 ) . The Arp2 / 3 Complex Is Localized to the Leading Lamellipodia of Motile Cells Stationary Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts produce actin - rich lamel - lipodia that actively protrude and retract but are not in - volved in directional motility . These were randomly dis - persed over the cell surface as is illustrated by the distribution of the p21 subunit of the Arp2 / 3 complex and actin in these cells ( Fig . 5 , A and B ) . To ascertain whether the Arp2 / 3 complex may be involved in membrane protru - sion during cell migration , we observed the localization of the complex in motile fibroblasts . We generated a popula - tion of moving Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts by wounding a con - fluent layer of cells . Cells at the margin of the wound re - sponded immediately by generating membrane ruffles at Figure 3 . Localization of Arp2 / 3 complex subunits in L . monocy - togenes – infected HeLa cells .

Within 30 min , they began to move outwards towards the center of the wound . p21 - Arc was localized to the broad actin - rich lamellipodia at the leading edges of these moving cells ( Fig . 5 , C and E , and actin localization in D and F ) . We also generated a population of motile primary cul - tured fibroblasts and looked at the distribution of Arp2 / 3 complex subunits in these cells by immunofluorescence . To prepare moving fibroblasts , tissue explants from the hearts of 7 - d - old embryonic chicks were plated onto cov - erslips . Cells migrate outward from explants within 12 h , and continue to move rapidly for up to 20 h ( Cramer et al . , 1997 ) . These cells assumed a morphology typical of loco - moting cells , with a cone - or fan - shaped cell body and broad lamellipodia at their leading edges ( Fig . 6 ) . Both Arp3 ( Fig . 6 A ) and p34 - Arc ( Fig . 6 C ) were localized through - out lamellipodia . Neither protein was found in actin bun - dles , fully consistent with their distribution in Swiss 3T3 fi - broblasts . Discussion The Arp2 / 3 Complex Consists of Evolutionarily Conserved Subunits The seven subunits of the human Arp2 / 3 complex define seven protein families that are present in diverse eukary - otic organisms . Six share sequence similarity with subunits of the A . castellanii complex ( sequence information for A . castellanii p14 is not yet available ) . Moreover , every sub - unit has a homologue S . cerevisiae , and the yeast equiva - lents of human p34 - Arc , p21 - Arc , p20 - Arc , and p16 - Arc have recently been shown to be components of the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Winter et al . , 1997 ) . This indicates that the struc - ture of the Arp2 / 3 complex has been conserved through evolution and suggests a corresponding conservation of its activity in all eukaryotic cells . The complex appears to be essential for cell viability and actin cytoskeletal function , as deletion of the genes encoding Arp2 , Arp3 , and Sop2p is lethal in yeast , and less severe mutations cause defects in actin organization and disrupt actin - dependent processes ( Lees - Miller et al . , 1992 ; Schwob and Martin , 1992 ; Moreau et al . , 1996 ; McCollum et al . , 1996 ; Balasubrama - nian et al . , 1996 ; Winter et al . , 1997 ) . Sequence , Structure , and Function—the Role of the Arp2 and Arp3 Subunits The Arp2 / 3 complex induces actin polymerization at the cell surface of L . monocytogenes ( Welch et al . , 1997 ) , sug - gesting that it performs a similar function in cells . It is likely to promote actin assembly by filament nucleation . Structural modeling of Arp2 and Arp3 proteins ( Kelleher et al . , 1995 ) has suggested that these subunits may serve as a template for the nucleation of polymerization , similar to the function performed by (cid:103) - tubulin in the initiation of mi - crotubule assembly ( Moritz et al . , 1995 ; Zheng et al . , 1995 ) . Although structural considerations led Kelleher et al . ( 1995 ) to propose that the Arp subunits interact with the pointed end of the filament , interaction with the barbed end remains a possibility . Of the Arp2 / 3 complex subunits , the sequences of Arp2 and Arp3 proteins are among the most highly conserved between species , consistent with their proposed role in nucleating actin polymerization . Sequence , Structure , and Function—the Role of p41 - Arc The other five subunits of the Arp2 / 3 complex may be im - portant for stabilizing its structure , regulating its biochem - ical activity , and / or determining its intracellular localiza - tion . The sequence and biochemical properties of one of these subunits , p41 - Arc , suggest that it plays an important regulatory role . This subunit is a member of the Sop2 fam - ily of proteins and is most similar to another human pro - tein , Sop2Hs . The similarity between these proteins sug - gests that they may both function as the p41 subunit of the human Arp2 / 3 complex . Multiple versions of the p41 sub - unit may adapt the functions of the complex to different cell types or developmental stages . Platelets appear to use only p41 - Arc since the peptides derived from the 41 - and 40 - kD polypeptides were all identical to it in sequence , Figure 4 .

Bar , 10 (cid:109) m . Welch et al . Arp2 / 3 Complex Sequence and Localization 381 and clearly different from the corresponding regions in Sop2Hs . p41 - Arc , like Sop2Hs , contains seven putative WD re - peats that are evenly dispersed over the entire sequence of the protein . The presence of WD repeats may provide some insight into the potential functions of this subunit . These repeats , which were first identified in the G (cid:98) sub - unit of heterotrimeric GTP - binding proteins , have since been found in between four to ten copies in proteins with a wide variety of functions ( for review see Neer et al . , 1994 ) . The repeat unit is involved in the formation of a character - istic three - dimensional structure known as a (cid:98) - propeller , each repeat constituting one blade of the propeller ( Wall et al . , 1995 ; Lambright et al . , 1996 ; for review see Neer and Smith , 1996 ) . Because many WD repeat - containing pro - teins participate in the formation of multiprotein com - plexes , one possibility is that p41 - Arc is involved in assem - bling and maintaining the structure of the Arp2 / 3 complex . Another intriguing possibility is that p41 - Arc mediates the interaction of the complex with other molecules that regulate its localization or activity . One known ligand of WD repeats is the pleckstrin homology ( PH ) domain ( for reviews see Lemmon et al . , 1996 ; Shaw , 1996 ) , which is found in a variety of cell signaling and cytoskeletal pro - teins that interact with cell membranes . In addition to binding WD repeat sequences , PH domains can simulta - neously bind phosphatidyl inositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate , and thus may serve as adapters that link WD repeat – contain - ing proteins to the cell membrane . We have found that the Arp2 / 3 complex is localized to the cell edges in lamellipo - dia . An interaction between p41 - Arc in the Arp2 / 3 com - plex and a PH domain – containing protein may mediate the recruitment of the complex to the cell membrane and may also serve to activate the actin polymerization pro - moting capacity of the complex . A protein that recruits the Arp2 / 3 complex to cell membranes would be functionally similar to the L . monocytogenes ActA protein , which is re - quired for actin polymerization by bacteria in vivo ( Do - mann et al . , 1992 ; Kocks et al . , 1992 ) and for the activity of the Arp2 / 3 complex at the bacterial surface ( Welch et al . , 1997 ) . Posttranslational modification of p41 - Arc may also reg - ulate the activity and intracellular distribution of the com - plex . We have determined that the 41 - and 40 - kD subunits of the platelet Arp2 / 3 complex are the same polypeptide , suggesting that they may differ in their state of posttrans - lational modification . However , the nature of this putative modification and its effect on the Arp2 / 3 complex remain to be determined . Sequence , Structure , and Function—the Role of p34 - Arc , p21 - Arc , p20 - Arc , and p16 - Arc The four other subunits of the Arp2 / 3 complex ( p34 - Arc , p21 - Arc , p20 - Arc , and p16 - Arc ) define four novel protein families .

The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 138 , 1997 382 family members from different species indicates that the structure of these subunits has been conserved through evolution . However , the sequences of these proteins do not indicate what their role in the structure or regulation of the complex may be . Two of these subunits of the A . castellanii complex—the 35 - , and either the 19 - , 18 - , or 14 - kD subunits—were found by chemical cross - linking to be intimately associated with actin ( Mullins et al . , 1997 ) . The Arp3 subunit and actin could be also cross - linked . It was suggested that these sub - units mediate the ability of the A . castellanii complex to bind the sides of actin filaments and to bundle actin fila - ments into parallel arrays in vitro . However , these sub - units do not exhibit any similarity to known actin - binding proteins , implying that they may possess novel actin - bind - ing motifs . Localization of the Arp2 / 3 Complex in Vertebrate Cells The localization of subunits of the Arp2 / 3 complex in yeast and A . castellanii is consistent with its proposed role in promoting actin polymerization in cells . The S . cerevi - siae Arp2 and Arp3 proteins are found in the motile corti - cal actin patches , but not in cytoplasmic cables that consist of bundled actin filaments ( Moreau et al . , 1996 ; Winter et al . , 1997 ) . S . pombe Arp3 shares a similar distribution , and in addition is absent from the contractile ring ( McCollum et al . , 1996 ) . In ameba , subunits of the complex colocalize with actin at the cell cortex ( Machesky et al . , 1994 ; Kelle - her et al . , 1995 ) . Staining is enriched in actin fibrils that may represent bundles of actin filaments , in agreement with the bundling activity exhibited by the A . castellanii complex in vitro ( Mullins et al . , 1997 ) . We have now determined the localization of multiple subunits of the Arp2 / 3 complex in vertebrate cells . The Arp3 , p34 - Arc , and p21 - Arc subunits are found in the lamellipodia of motile and stationary fibroblasts . They are also localized to L . monocytogenes assembled actin clouds and tails in infected cells . In contrast , Arp3 , p34 - Arc , and p21 - Arc were not detected in cellular bundles of actin , in - cluding stress fibers in tissue culture fibroblasts and graded polarity bundles ( Cramer et al . , 1997 ) in primary cultures of chick embryo fibroblasts . Moreover , they have not been observed in filopodia , which also contain bun - dled actin ( DePace , A . , M . Welch , and T . Mitchison , un - published results ) . Actin filaments in lamellipodia and those in actin bun - dles differ in their spatial organization and dynamic prop - erties . Filaments in lamellipodia are arranged as an or - thogonal meshwork and are oriented at an angle of (cid:122) 45 (cid:56) , relative to the direction of protrusion ( Small et al . , 1995 ) . They exhibit rapid polymerization dynamics , turning over Figure 6 . Localization of Arp2 / 3 complex subunits in primary culture fibroblasts from embryonic chick hearts by indirect immunofluores - cence .

Bar , 10 (cid:109) m . Welch et al . Arp2 / 3 Complex Sequence and Localization 383 with a t 1 / 2 of (cid:44) 1 min in some cell types ( Theriot and Mitch - ison , 1991 ) . This rapid turnover is similar to that seen for filaments in L . monocytogenes tails ( Theriot et al . , 1992 ) . Conversely , filaments in stress fibers and other cellular bundles are arranged in closely spaced parallel arrays . They exhibit much slower polymerization dynamics than filaments in lamellipodia ( Theriot and Mitchison , 1991 ) . We do not detect the Arp2 / 3 complex in actin bundles , suggesting that the filament side - binding and bundling ac - tivity exhibited by the complex in vitro ( Mullins et al . , 1997 ) may not be a primary determinant of its function in vertebrate cells . Instead , we find that the Arp2 / 3 complex is present with the rapidly polymerizing and depolymeriz - ing populations of actin filaments in lamellipodia and L . monocytogenes tails , further strengthening the analogy be - tween bacterial motility and lamellipodial protrusion . To - gether with the biochemical activity of the Arp2 / 3 com - plex , these results suggest a model in which the complex promotes actin polymerization in the lamellipodium and participates in lamellipodial protrusion . The ability of the complex to bind filaments might serve to retain the com - plex in the lamellipodium , making it readily available for additional rounds of polymerization . Before we can put together a comprehensive model of actin polymerization dynamics in lamellipodia , several outstanding questions need to be answered . For example , it is not clear whether actin polymerization occurs through - out the lamellipodium , matching the distribution of Arp2 / 3 complex , or only at the leading edge . In addition , it is not known whether the mechanism of new actin filament poly - merization involves the elongation of existing filaments or continuous nucleation of new filaments . Finally , the mech - anisms that regulate the spatial and temporal control of actin polymerization have yet to be determined . Further characterization of the interactions of the Arp2 / 3 complex with actin filaments and with factors that regulate its activ - ity and localization should help shed light on the answers to these outstanding problems .
