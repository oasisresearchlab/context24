The functional versatility of this system could be explained by an underlying anatomical complexity ; however , the detailed characterization of the medial prefrontal cortical ( mPFC ) innervation of the NAc and VTA is still lacking . Therefore , combining classical retrograde and conditional viral tracing techniques with multiple fluorescent immunohistochemistry , we sought to deliver a precise , cell - and layer - specific anatomical description of the cortico - mesolimbic pathways . We demonstrated that NAc - ( mPFC NAc ) and VTA - projecting mPFC ( mPFC VTA ) populations show different laminar distribution ( layers 2 / 3 - 5a and 5b - 6 , respectively ) and express different molecular markers . Specifically , calbindin and Ntsr1 are specific to mPFC NAc neurons , while mPFC VTA neurons express high levels of Ctip2 and FoxP2 , indicating that these populations are mostly separated at the cellular level . We directly tested this with double retrograde tracing and Canine adenovirus type 2 - mediated viral labelling and found that there is indeed minimal overlap between the two populations . Furthermore , whole - brain analysis revealed that the projection patter of these populations is also different throughout the brain . Taken together , we demonstrated that the NAc and the VTA are innervated by two , mostly non - overlapping mPFC populations with different laminar distribution and molecular profile . These results can contribute to the advancement in our understanding of mesocorticolimbic functions and its disorders in future studies . Introduction The medial prefrontal cortex ( mPFC ) , the nucleus accumbens ( NAc ) and the ventral tegmental area ( VTA ) are the three major elements of the mesocorticolimbic system that controls a wide range of behaviors ( Tzschentke and Schmidt , 2000 ; Russo and Nestler , 2013 ; Riga et al . , 2014 ) . mPFC provides the major source of glutamatergic input to the NAc ( Brog et al . , 1993 ; Asher and Lodge , 2012 ; Li et al . , 2018 ) and to the VTA ( Geisler and Zahm , 2005 ; Mahler and Aston - Jones , 2012 ; Faget et al . , 2016 ) . Direct mPFC innervation in the NAc has been implicated in various cognitive processes and malfunctions , such as attention regulation ( Christakou et al . , 2004 ) , impulse control ( Feja and Koch , 2015 ) , addiction ( Schmidt et al . , 2005 ; Peters et al . , 2008 ; Seif et al . , 2013 ; Domingo - Rodriguez et al . , 2020 ) and depression ( Vialou et al . , 2014 ) . mPFC can also bidirectionally modulate neuronal activity in VTA , including NAc - and mPFC - projecting dopaminergic neurons ( Gariano and Groves , 1988 ; Carr and Sesack , 2000 ; Lodge , 2011 ) . Accordingly , stimulation of excitatory neurons in the mPFC elicits dopamine release in the NAc via the VTA ( Taber et al . , 1995 ; Karreman and Moghaddam , 1996 ) and optogenetic activation of mPFC input in the VTA is reinforcing ( Beier et al . , 2015 ; Pan et al . , 2021 ) . Although , excitatory neurons in the mPFC are distributed in distinct layers and possess various projection patterns and molecular identity , it is not known how this diversity correlates to the above - mentioned cortical functions . Several well established classification systems exist , based on anatomical , physiological , molecular and connectivity profile of excitatory neurons in primary motor / sensory neocortical areas ( Harris et al . , 2014 , 2019 ; Harris and Shepherd , 2015 ; Baker et al . , 2018 ; Bakken et al . , 2021 ) . A widely accepted one divides principal neurons to three major classes according to their laminar distribution and projection pattern . Intertelencephalic ( IT ) cells are present in layers 2 - 6 ( L2 - 6 ) and project to ipsi - and contralateral neocortex and striatum . Neurons of the pyramidal tract ( PT , also known as extratelencephalic ) class are located mostly in the L5b and innervate mostly mesencephalic and diencephalic regions . The third , corticothalamic ( CT ) class is composed of neurons in the L6 that innervate the thalamus . However , some studies suggest that this classification might be oversimplified and not universally applicable to all cortical areas ( Groh et al . , 2010 ; Kim et al . , 2015 ) . Indeed , recent publications divided motor cortical neurons into even more new subclasses according to their genetic identity ( Callaway et al . , 2021 ; Zhang et al . , 2021 ) . Thus , detailed class - , layer - and cell - selective examination is necessary to validate traditional classification systems of cortical pyramidal neurons , also in the mPFC . The lack of wide - spread adoption of such specific experimental approaches in the mPFC might be the source of numerous contradictions and inconsistencies present in the mesocorticolimbic literature . For instance , in a recent publication , Kim et al . ( 2017 ) demonstrated that NAc - and VTA - projecting mPFC neurons are mostly separated at the cellular level , while other experiments investigating the target selectivity of mPFC cells yielded contradictory results ( Thierry et al . , 1983 ; Ferino et al . , 1987 ; Cassell et al . , 1989 ; Pinto and Sesack , 2000 ; Gabbott et al . , 2005 ; Morishima and Kawaguchi , 2006 ; Vázquez - Borsetti et al . , 2011 ; Stuber et al . , 2011 ; Kim et al . , 2017 ; Otis et al . , 2017 ; Gao et al . , 2020 ) . Such inconsistencies could be resolved by applying combined layer - and cell - selective approaches . Therefore , combining classical tracing techniques , conditional viral labelling , and multiple fluorescent staining , we have begun to describe the prefrontal innervation of the NAc and VTA in a class - , layer - and cell - specific manner . Here we report that these two structures are innervated by two , rather non - overlapping mPFC neuron populations . While NAc - innervating neurons tend to be found in the L2 / 3 and L5a , VTA - projecting cells are mostly localized in the L5b and L6 , resembling IT and PT projection classes , respectively . Accordingly , these two populations express different combination of molecular markers and have different afferent connections throughout the brain . Furthermore , we found that in comparison with primer cortical areas , the mPFC differs in several cytoarchitectural features . Results Distribution and molecular characterization of NAc - projecting mPFC cells In order to investigate the mPFC - NAc connection , first , we injected retrograde tracers Cholera toxin B subunit ( CTB ) or FluoroGold ( FG ) into the NAc ( Fig . 1 A - C ) . Injection sites included both the core ( NAcC ) and shell ( NAcSh ) region ( Fig . 1 C ) . Retrogradely labelled NAc - projecting mPFC cells ( mPFC NAc ) were present throughout the mPFC . To identify the exact subregional distribution of mPFC NAc neurons , we performed multiple fluorescent immunohistochemical ( IHC Fluo ) staining for different molecular markers . As it was previously reported ( Mátyás et al . , 2014 ) , parvalbumin ( PV ) staining delineates the dorsal and ventral borders of the prelimbic ( PrL ) subregion of the mPFC ( Fig . 1 - 1 A , asterisk ) . Calbindin ( Calb1 ) was used to define layer 2 / 3 ( L2 / 3 ) ( van Brederode et al . , 1991 ; Sun et al . , 2002 ) and the ventral border of the infralimbic cortex ( IL ) , where the clearly visible L2 / 3 diminishes , as well as to visualize the thickening of L1 , a characteristic of the deep peduncular cortex ( DP ) ( Akhter et al . , 2014 ) ( Fig . 1 - 1 B , number sign ) . COUP - TF - interacting protein 2 ( Ctip2 , also known as Bcl111b ) was used to outline the L5b and L6 ( Arlotta et al . , 2005 ; Ueta et al . , 2014 ; Kim et al . , 2017 ) ( Fig . 1 - 1 C ) . Furthermore , forkhead box protein P2 ( FoxP2 ) staining identifies the L6 ( Ferland et al . , 2003 ) and the gradual thinning and disappearance of a distinct L6 towards the ventralmost part of the mPFC ( Fig . 1 - 1 D , cross ) .

According to the obtained molecular - based mPFC map , most mPFC NAc neurons were found in the PrL , medial orbital ( MO ) and IL subregions and , to a lower extent , in the DP , cingulate area 1 - 2 ( Cg1 - 2 ) and secondary motor ( M2 ) cortices . Only a few cells were found in the dorsal tenia tecta ( DTT , also known as anterior hippocampal continuation ) , primary motor ( M1 ) and the adjacent orbital cortices ( Fig . 1 D - E ) . Next , we analyzed the laminar distribution of the retrogradely labelled cells using IHC Fluo against Calb1 , Ctip2 and FoxP2 ( Fig . 1 F - H , Fig . 1 - 1 ) . This analysis revealed that most mPFC NAc neurons localized in the Calb1 - rich L2 / 3 and in the L5a , and , to a lower extent , in the L5b ( Fig . 1 F - G ) . Only a small number of cells were found in the FoxP2 - expressing L6 ( Fig . 1 H ) . To characterize the molecular identity of mPFC NAc cells , we quantified their Calb1 - , Ctip2 and FoxP2 - expression ( Fig . 1 , F3 - H3 , J - K ) . Our analysis revealed that about two - thirds ( 68 . 64 ± 2 . 62 % , n = 3 animals , N Calb1 + / FG + = 197 / 289 cells ; Fig . 1 F3 , I , left bar ; Table 1 ) of mPFC NAc neurons in the L2 / 3 expressed Calb1 , while only a small proportion did so in the L5 - 6 ( 2 . 87 ± 1 . 15 % , N Calb1 + / FG + = 18 / 655 cells ; Fig . 1 I , middle bar ; Table 1 ) . Collectively , approximately one - fifth of all mPFC NAc neurons expressed Calb1 ( 22 . 78 ± 1 . 86 % , N Calb1 + / FG + = 215 / 944 cells ; Fig . 2 I , right bar ; Table 1 ) . Although most of the mPFC NAc cells were found in the Ctip2 - negative L2 / 3 and 5a , some cells were found in the deeper layers as well . Confocal analysis revealed that only a small proportion of superficial ( i . e . , L2 / 3 - 5a ) cells are Ctip2 - positive ( 8 . 26 ± 2 . 6 % , n = 3 animals , N Ctip2 + / FG + = 45 / 767 cells ; Fig . 1 G3 , J , left bar ; Table 1 ) , while in the deeper layers ( i . e . , L5b - 6 ) , although relatively few in number , the majority of cells expressed Ctip2 ( 64 . 1 ± 4 . 76 % , N Ctip2 + / FG + = 130 / 204 cells ; Fig . 1 J , middle bar ; Table 1 ) . Collectively , approximately one - fifth of all mPFC NAc cells expressed Ctip2 ( 20 . 8 ± 12 . 1 % , N Ctip2 + / FG + = 175 / 971 cells ; Fig . 1 J , left bar ; Table 1 ) . Finally , only a negligible number of mPFC NAc cells expressed FoxP2 ( 2 . 11 ± 1 . 84 % , n = 3 animals , N FoxP2 + / FG + = 22 / 862 cells , Fig . 1 H3 , K ; Table 1 ) . Altogether , retrograde tracing experiments revealed that mPFC NAc neurons were mostly localized in the L2 / 3 and 5a of the PrL , MO and IL cortices . Approximately one - fifth of these cells express Calb1 – most of them are localized in the L2 / 3 , where Calb1 expression is higher ( ~ 70 % ) – , and another one - fifth express Ctip2 , mostly in the L5b - 6 . Distribution and molecular characterization of VTA - projecting mPFC cells Next , we investigated the distribution of VTA - projecting neurons in the mPFC ( mPFC VTA ) . We used the previously described retrograde tracing approach in the VTA ( Fig . 2 A ) identified with IHC Fluo against tyrosine hydroxylase ( TH ; Fig . 2 B - C ) ( Oades and Halliday , 1987 ; Morales and Margolis , 2017 ) . Most mPFC VTA neurons were localized in the PrL , MO , Cg1 - 2 , IL and DP cortices ( Fig . 2 D - E ) . There were also several labelled cells in the adjacent orbital and motor cortices as well as in the DTT ( Fig . 2 D ) . Regarding their laminar distribution , we found that there were two main clusters of mPFC VTA cells ( Fig . 2 D , F - H ) . One , visually smaller population was found in the more superficial part of the posterior MO , PrL and Cg1 , and throughout the Cg2 , IL and DP cortices ( Fig . 2 D ) . Cells in this cluster were mostly localized close to the border of L5a and L5b ( Fig . 2 F - G ) . The other cluster was found in the deeper parts ( L5b - L6 ) of the anterior MO , PrL and Cg1 , and posterior IL and DP cortices ( Fig . 2 D , H ) . The separation of these two mPFC VTA clusters was most prominent between Bregma + 1 . 2 - 1 . 8 mm , as it was also shown in previous publications ( Geisler and Zahm , 2005 ; Mahler and Aston - Jones , 2012 ) .

Note that the labelled cells are almost exclusively localized in the L5b ( Ctip2 ) and L6 ( Ctip2 + FoxP2 ) layers . F3 - H3 , High magnification confocal images showing the coexpression of FG and Calb1 ( F3 ) , Ctip2 ( G3 ) or FoxP2 ( H3 ) . White arrowheads indicate coexpression , empty arrowheads indicate the lack of marker expression .

All data are shown as mean ± SD . Higher magnification confocal analysis revealed that only a marginal proportion ( 1 . 31 ± 0 . 5 % , n = 3 animals , N Calb1 + / FG + = 15 / 1165 cells , Fig . 2 F3 , I ; Table 2 ) of all mPFC VTA cells expressed Calb1 . We also quantified the Ctip2 - expression of mPFC VTA neurons and found that the vast majority of these cells express Ctip2 ( 95 . 07 ± 0 . 6 % , n = 3 animals , N Ctip2 + / FG + = 481 / 506 cells ; Fig . 2 G3 , J ; Table 2 ) . This finding is in accordance with previous results ( Kim et al . , 2017 ) showing CTIP2 gene enrichment in mPFC VTA neurons . Finally , most L6 mPFC VTA cells expressed FoxP2 ( 78 . 86 ± 8 . 79 % , n = 3 animals , N FoxP2 + / FG + = 761 / 951 cells ; Fig . 2 H3 , K , middle bar ; Table 2 ) . On the other hand , in the superficial layers ( L2 / 3 - L5 ) , only a small proportion ( 8 . 69 ± 2 . 13 % , N FoxP2 + / FG + = 77 / 920 cells ; Table 2 ) of mPFC VTA cells were FoxP2 - positive ( Fig . 1 K , left bar ) . In total , about half of all mPFC VTA neurons expressed FoxP2 ( 45 . 93 ± 17 . 15 % , N FoxP2 + / FG + = 838 / 1871 cells ; Fig . 2 K , right bar ; Table 2 ) . Taken together , using retrograde tracing experiments we identified two clusters of mPFC VTA neurons distributed throughout the mPFC : one FoxP2 - , and most probably Ctip2 - expressing population localized mostly in the L6 ( approximately half of all neurons ) ; and one , mostly FoxP2 - negative , but Ctip2 - positive population in the layer 5b . Utility of Cre mouse lines to label mPFC neurons in a layer - selective manner We found retrogradely labelled mPFC NAC and mPFC VTA neurons in all cellular layers of the mPFC in varying densities . Next , we sought to confirm the laminar organizations of the projecting cells using transgenic mice expressing Cre - recombinase enzyme in a layer - selective manner . We used the following layer - specific Cre - expressing mouse strains : Calb1 - ( L2 / 3 ) , Retinol Binding Protein 4 - ( Rbp4 ; L5 ) , Neurotensin Receptor 1 ( Ntsr1 ; L6 ) and FoxP2 - Cre ( L6 ) ( van Brederode et al . , 1991 ; Hof et al . , 1999 ; Sun et al . , 2002 ; Ferland et al . , 2003 ; Molyneaux et al . , 2007 ; Harris et al . , 2014 , 2019 ; Sundberg et al . , 2018 ; Callaway et al . , 2021 ; Matho et al . , 2021 ; Muñoz - Castañeda et al . , 2021 ) in combination with Cre - dependent adeno - associated viral vectors ( AAVs ) ( Fig . 3 A - E ) . Furthermore , we used a Thymocyte differentiation antigen 1 ( Thy1 ) - Cre mouse line as control , in which Cre enzyme is expressed in all pyramidal neurons , regardless of their laminar localization ( Fig . 3 F ) . Virally labelled cell bodies in all strains were primarily found in the PrL , IL , Cg1 - 2 , MO , and , to a lower extent , in the DP , the ventromedial M2 , the dorsal part of the DTT and the medial part of the VO cortex ( Fig . 3 B - F ) in good correspondence with the distribution of the retrogradely labelled mPFC NAC and mPFC VTA neurons ( Fig . 1 , Fig . 2 ) . Note that viral expression was always analyzed after IHC - enhancement of eYFP / mCherry , because this method revealed structures – mostly thin axon - branches , but also some cell bodies - and fine details ( e . g . , dendritic spines ) otherwise not detectable ( see Methods ) ( Fig . 3 - 1 ) .

Since the majority of previous publications describing cortical layer - specific markers focused on primary cortical areas , we compared the expression pattern of virally labelled cells in the mPFC – a higher - order cortical region - ( Fig . 3 - 2 A - E ) and in the primary motor cortex ( M1 , Fig . 3 - 2 F - J ) - a primary frontal cortical area – in each mouse strain . Labelled cells in the Calb1 - Cre animals showed similar distribution in both cortical areas : most of them were found in the L2 / 3 with scattered cells in the L5 ( Fig . 3 - 2 A , F ) ( Muñoz - Castañeda et al . , 2021 ) . Interestingly , Rbp4 - , and Ntsr1 - expressing cells showed somewhat different distribution in the two cortical regions ( Fig . 3 - 2 B - C , G - H ) . In the Rbp4 - Cre strain , virally labelled cells in the mPFC were found to some extent in the L2 / 3 – especially in the ventral part of the mPFC , in the IL and DP – besides the well - known L5 location . In the M1 , only the L5 population was present ( Callaway et al . , 2021 ; Muñoz - Castañeda et al . , 2021 ) ( Fig . 3 - 2 B , G ) . In the Ntsr1 - Cre animals , no virally labelled neurons were found in the L6 in the mPFC , only in the L5a ( Fig . 3 - 2 C ) . In the M1 cortex , Ntsr1 - expressing labelled cells were found exclusively in the L6 , as it was previously reported ( DeNardo et al . , 2015 ; Tasic et al . , 2016 ; Sundberg et al . , 2018 ; Callaway et al . , 2021 ; Muñoz - Castañeda et al . , 2021 ) ( Fig . 3 - 2 H ) . In the Foxp2 - and Thy1 - Cre animals we did not observe any difference between the two cortical regions : AAV transduced cells were found in the L6 ( Fig . 3 - 2 D , I ) , or in all cellular layers of the mPFC ( Fig . 3 - 2 E ) and the M1 ( Fig . 3 - 2 J ) , respectively . Figure 3 - 2 . Layer - specific Cre mouse lines reveal different laminal distribution of mPFC and primary motor cortical cells .

Note the different distribution of Rbp4 - ( B , G ) and Ntsr1 - expressing ( C , H ) cells in the two cortical regions . Dashed lines indicate layer borders defined with IHC Fluo against Calb1 , Ctip2 or FoxP2 ( Fig . 1 - 2 ) . Scale bars : 200 µm . Together , these results show that these mouse strains can be used to label and investigate distinct layers of prefrontal cell populations , confirming previous findings ( van Brederode et al . , 1991 ; Hof et al . , 1999 ; Sun et al . , 2002 ; Ferland et al . , 2003 ; Molyneaux et al . , 2007 ; Harris et al . , 2014 , 2019 ; Sundberg et al . , 2018 ; Callaway et al . , 2021 ; Matho et al . , 2021 ; Muñoz - Castañeda et al . , 2021 ) . However , in some cases ( Rbp4 - , Ntsr1 - Cre ) the distribution of labelled neurons was somewhat different in the mPFC compared to M1 . Layer - selective prefrontal cortical innervation of the NAc and VTA After validating the use of these Cre mouse strains and AAV vectors to label mPFC neuron populations in a layer - selective manner , we sought to explore their projection patterns in the NAc and VTA . In order to do this , we performed confocal microscopy combined with multiple IHC Fluo in tissue samples taken from the mPFC animals described in the previous section . In the Calb1 - Cre strain – where viral transduced cells were confined to the L2 / 3 – labelled axons were found in the NAc ( Fig . 3 G ) but not in the VTA ( Fig . 3 L ) . These results are in accordance with our retrograde tracing results showing that a high proportion of mPFC NAC neurons in the L2 / 3 express Calb1 ( Fig . 1 ) , and the lack of mPFC VTA cells in the Calb1 - rich layer 2 / 3 ( Fig . 2 ) . In the Rbp4 - Cre animals ( L2 / 3 - 5 ) , AAV labelled axons were found both in the NAc ( Fig . 3 H ) and VTA ( Fig . 3 M ) also confirming our retrograde tracing result ( Fig . 1 , Fig . 2 ) . Ntsr1 - Cre expressing cells – localized in the L5a ( Fig . 3 - 1 C ) , where most of the mPFC NAc neurons were found previously ( Fig . 1 ) – projected to the NAc with visually dense arborization ( Fig . 3 I ) but avoided the VTA ( Fig . 3 N ) . In the FoxP2 - Cre strain ( L6 ) , only a small number of AAV - labeled axons was present in the NAc ( Fig . 3 J ) , while a relatively dense arborization of labelled axons was found in the VTA ( Fig . 3 O ) . This is in good accordance with our previous findings demonstrating that only a marginal proportion of mPFC NAC neurons express FoxP2 ( Fig . 1 ) , while almost half of all mPFC VTA cells does so ( Fig . 2 ) . Finally , in the control Thy1 - Cre strain we observed dense axonal arborization both in the NAc ( Fig . 3 K ) and VTA ( Fig . 3 P ) . Taken together , our classical retrograde and cell type - specific anterograde viral tracing experiments revealed that mPFC NAc and mPFC VTA neuron populations are mostly separated in the L2 / 3 - 5a and L5b - 6 ( respectively ) , although this separation is not exclusive . Conversely , these populations seem to overlap in the L5 , but it is not clear whether a single mPFC neuron projects to both targets simultaneously or shows target selectivity . NAc - and VTA - projecting mPFC populations are mostly non - overlapping Next , we aimed to answer the open question whether a single mPFC can innervate the NAc and VTA simultaneously or not . Although previous studies investigated the target selectivity of mPFC neurons extensively , some reported relatively high ratio of multiple - projection ( Thierry et al . , 1983 ; Ferino et al . , 1987 ; Cassell et al . , 1989 ; Vázquez - Borsetti et al . , 2011 ; Rojas - Piloni et al . , 2017 ) , while others found the opposite ( Pinto and Sesack , 2000 ; Gabbott et al . , 2005 ; Morishima and Kawaguchi , 2006 ; Kim et al . , 2017 ; Otis et al . , 2017 ; Cruz et al . , 2021 ) . Therefore , we carried out two independent experimental approaches to clarify this issue ( Fig . 4 ) . Figure 4 . VTA and NAc are mostly innervated by non - overlapping mPFC cell populations .

Data are shown as mean ± SD . First , we performed double retrograde tracings with FG and CTB ( interchangeably ) from the NAc and the VTA ( Fig . 4 A - B ) and investigated the overlap of the labelled populations in the mPFC ( Fig . 4 C ) . Our results showed that only a small proportion of all cells contained both tracers ( NAc + VTA / VTA = 6 . 78 ± 5 . 97 % , NAc + VTA / NAc = 1 . 54 ± 1 . 40 % , NAc + VTA / total = 1 . 26 ± 1 . 12 % ; N NAc = 269 , 2940 , 2551 cells , N VTA = 111 , 489 , 770 cells , N VTA + NAc = 0 , 55 , 70 cells ; n = 3 mice ; Fig . 4 D ; Table 3 ) and most of them were found in the L5 . Although these results indicate that mPFC NAc and mPFC VTA populations are mostly non - overlapping at the cellular level , we considered that double retrograde technique tends to underestimate the actual proportion of multiple projecting cells . Therefore , we also applied an intersectional viral tracing approach to clarify the target selectivity of mPFC neurons . We injected Canine adenovirus type 2 carrying Cre - recombinase gene ( CAV2 - Cre ) into the NAc or VTA , and Cre - dependent AAV - DIO - mCherry into the mPFC ( Fig . 5 A - C ) , a technique that was previously shown to be suitable to label cortico - tegmental and cortico - accumbal pathways ( Beier et al . , 2015 ; Kerstetter et al . , 2016 ; Kim et al . , 2017 ; Cruz et al . , 2021 ) . Using this method , we could selectively label mPFC NAC and mPFC VTA neurons with their entire axonal arborization , including collaterals projecting to other brain regions . After confirming that the injection sites were correctly positioned in the NAc or VTA ( se e Methods , Fig . 5 B1 , C1 ) and in the mPFC ( Fig . 5 B2 , C2 ) , we compared the projection pattern of mPFC NAc and mPFC VTA neurons both in the NAc and the VTA ( Fig . 5 D - E ) . We found that mPFC NAc axons were abundant in the NAc ( Fig . 5 D , left ) , while only a few labelled axons were present in the VTA ( Fig . 5 D , right ) . Conversely , mPFC VTA neurons sent only sparse innervation to the NAc ( Fig . 5 E , left ) , but we found dense innervation in the VTA ( Fig . 5 E , right ) . Figure 5 .

Data are shown as mean ± SD . To quantify these results , we applied high magnification confocal imaging ( 63x ) to measure and compare the relative axon densities ( RAD ) in the two target areas . This quantitative analysis showed that mPFC NAc neurons innervated the NAc almost ten - fold stronger than the VTA ( RAD ( VTA / NAc ) = 0 . 11 ± 0 . 06 ; n = 3 animals ; Fig . 5 H ; Table 4 ) . On the other hand , mPFC VTA cells innervated preferentially the VTA as opposed to the NAc ( RAD ( VTA / NAc ) = 3 . 45 ± 0 . 41 ; n = 3 animals ; Fig . 5 H ; Table 4 ) . As controls , we used Rbp4 - ( mPFC Rbp4 ) and Thy1 - Cre ( mPFC Thy1 ) animals from the previous viral tracing experiments ( Fig . 4 ) , since these two cell populations innervated both the NAc and VTA intensively ( Fig . 5 F - G ) . Our analysis revealed that mPFC Rbp4 cells innervated both regions similarly ( RAD ( VTA / NAc ) = 0 . 88 ± 0 . 49 ; n = 3 animals ; Fig . 5 F , H ; Table 4 ) , while mPFC Thy1 cells tended to innervate NAc slightly more intensively ( RAD ( VTA / NAc ) = 0 . 53 ± 0 . 28 ; n = 3 animals ; Fig . 5 G - H ; Table 4 ) . One - way ANOVA analysis revealed significant differences between groups ( F ( 3 , 8 ) = 55 . 56 ; p = 0 . 000011 ; mPFC NAc vs mPFC VTA , p = 0 . 0000026 ; mPFC NAc vs mPFC Rbp4 , p = 0 . 028 ; mPFC NAc vs mPFC Thy1 , p = 0 . 18 ; mPFC VTA vs mPFC Rbp4 , p = 0 . 000018 ; mPFC VTA vs mPFC Thy1 , p = 0 . 0000072 ; LSD post - hoc test ; Fig . 5 H ) . These and the double retrograde tracing results indicate that mPFC NAc and mPFC VTA neurons are rather non - overlapping , although there is a marginal population – in the L5 – that innervates both areas . mPFC NAc and mPFC VTA populations have different efferent connections After confirming that mPFC NAc and mPFC VTA neurons are mostly separated at the cellular level , we sought to investigate the projection pattern of these populations throughout the brain . Therefore , we used immunoperoxidase development with DAB - Ni as a chromogen ( IHC DAB - Ni ) ( Fig . 3 - 1 ) for the mPFC NAc ( n = 3 mice ) and mPFC VTA ( n = 3 mice ) brain samples . Semi - quantitative investigation of the samples revealed clear differences between the two populations ( Fig . 6 ; Table 5 ) . Most notably , mPFC NAc neurons projected intensively to the ipsi - and contralateral striatum – including the NAc ( Fig . 6 C , left ) - , various cortical areas ( Fig . 6 A - H , left ) , and the amygdala ( Fig . 6 F , left ) . On the other hand , mPFC VTA innervation was strongest in the lateral ( LS ) and medial septum ( MS ; Fig . 6 C , right ) , the hypothalamus ( HT ) , the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis ( BNST ; Fig . 6 D - F , right ) , the midline thalamic nuclei ( Fig . 6 E - F ) , the zona incerta ( ZI ; Fig . 6 F , right ) and various tectal ( Fig . 6 G - H , right ) , tegmental – including the VTA – ( Fig . 6 G - I , right ) and pontine regions ( Fig . 6 G - I , right ) . Taken together , our investigation revealed that mPFC NAc and mPFC VTA populations differ in their projection patterns not only in the NAc and VTA , but throughout the brain .

Discussion Here we described the molecular , neurochemical , and anatomical characteristics of mPFC neurons innervating the mesocorticolimbic system . We found that most mPFC neurons projecting to the NAc and the VTA were localized in the same subregions , but in different layers . Accordingly , mPFC NAc and mPFC VTA neuron populations showed minimal overlap at the cellular level , expressed different combination of layer - specific molecular markers and their efferent connections showed clear differences throughout the brain . While mPFC NAc neurons mostly innervated ipsi - and contralateral cortical , striatal and amygdalar regions , mPFC VTA axons were most abundant in various ipsilateral diencephalic and mesencephalic areas . Figure 7 . Summary : molecular characteristics and laminar distribution of the two identified projection groups in the mPFC . Neurons that innervate the NAc ( ‘IT - like’ ) are mostly localized in the upper layers of the mPFC ( L2 / 3 - 5a ) and express Calb1 ( green ) , Ntsr1 ( purple ) , Rbp4 ( orange ) and , to a lesser extent , Ctip2 ( magenta ) . mPFC cells that innervate the VTA ( ‘PT - like’ ) are mostly localized in the deeper layers ( L5b - 6 ) and express Ctip2 , FoxP2 ( cyan ) and Rbp4 . Connections between NAc and VTA , and ascending VTA pathways ( gray arrows ) are based on literature data ( see Introduction , Discussion ) . Generally , mPFC NAc and mPFC VTA neurons were found in the same subregions , namely the PL , IL , MO , Cg1 , DP and DTT , confirming previous results ( Gabbott et al . , 2005 ) . However , one notable difference emerged between the two populations . While mPFC NAc neurons formed one , mostly continuous cluster with the highest number of cells in the PL , IL , and MO , mPFC VTA neurons formed two visually distinct laminar clusters : one in the middle and another in the deeper part of the mPFC . Regarding their laminar distribution , mPFC NAc neurons were mostly found in the superficial layers ( L2 / 3 and L5a ) , as previously reported ( Kim et al . , 2017 ) . Traditionally , most striatum - projecting cortical neurons belong to the IT projection group ( Harris and Shepherd , 2015 ) . High ratio of Calb1 expressing neurons in the L2 / 3 ( ~ 70 % ) and strong innervation of the NAc in the Calb1 - Cre animals also suggest their IT - like nature , since Calb1 is considered to be an IT - marker ( Harris et al . , 2019 ) . The functional importance of these L2 / 3 mPFC cells has been shown by Shrestha and colleagues ( 2015 ) demonstrating that their genetic perturbation leads to augmented depressive behavior in response to stressful events , possibly via the NAc - hypothalamic pathway . In addition to Calb1 , Rbp4 - a genetic marker for both IT and PT neurons ( Rojas - Piloni et al . , 2017 ; Harris et al . , 2019 ) - , was also expressed to some extent in the L2 / 3 besides the L5 of the mPFC . Accordingly , these cells provided strong input to NAc . Surprisingly , despite their relatively low number , mPFC neurons expressing Ntsr1 , distributed only in the L5a , also heavily innervated the NAc . These observations indicate regional differences in the distribution of the Rbp4 and Ntsr1 - expressing cortical neurons , since Rbp4 is known to be present in the L5 , while Ntsr1 is a generally used marker for L6 CT neurons in other , mostly primary cortical regions ( Jeong et al . , 2016 ; Sundberg et al . , 2018 ; Matho et al . , 2021 ) . We confirmed these results using the same viral tracing experimental approach and the same animal strains targeting the neighboring primary motor cortex to exclude the possibility of a faulty mouse / viral strain . In fact , Rbp4 cells were exclusively localized in the L5 of M1 . Furthermore , Ntsr1 neurons were only distributed in the L6 of the M1 and innervated the thalamus but not the striatum ( data not shown ) . These results indicate that some molecular markers have distinct laminar distribution and projection patterns in primary and higher order cortical areas . Further supporting this notion , we demonstrated that Ctip2 , which is generally present in PT neurons of the L5b - L6 ( Arlotta et al . , 2005 ; Ueta et al . , 2014 ; Kim et al . , 2017 ) was expressed in about one - fifth of all mPFC NAc ( IT - like ) neurons . This suggests that either some PT - like mPFC neurons innervate the striatum or , alternatively , some IT - like neurons express Ctip2 in the mPFC . Previous results reported that PT neurons in the motor cortex can weakly innervate the striatum ( Economo et al . , 2018 ; Matho et al . , 2021 ) supporting the first option . However , to the best of our knowledge , there is no direct evidence for the complete absence of Ctip2 - expression in IT neurons , so we cannot completely rule out the second possibility either . While mPFC NAc neurons were present rather superficially , mPFC VTA neurons were mostly localized in the deeper layers , namely in L5b and L6 ( Geisler and Zahm , 2005 ) and the vast majority ( ~ 95 % ) of them expressed Ctip2 . Furthermore , Rbp4 neurons – shown to have reinforcing effect ( Pan et al . , 2021 ) – innervated the VTA and the NAc with a similar intensity . If we assume that IT - and PT - like Rbp4 neurons are spatially separated ( in L2 / 3 - L5a and L5b , respectively ) , and that IT - like neurons innervate the NAc but not the VTA , then , these results suggest that mPFC VTA neurons have a PT - like phenotype . However , FoxP2 , a L6 CT neuron marker ( Kast et al . , 2019 ; Matho et al . , 2021 ) was also expressed by almost half of all mPFC VTA cells . This observation was confirmed by cell - specific viral tracing in the FoxP2 - Cre mouse strain , where labelled neurons were found in the L6 and projected heavily to the VTA and to the thalamus ( data not shown ) , resembling a mixed PT - CT population . Accordingly , axons of the CAV2 - Cre - labelled mPFC VTA neurons collateralized to the thalamus as well . In contrast , FoxP2 neurons in the M1 cortex showed clear CT phenotype ( data not shown ) , as it was previously reported ( Matho et al . , 2021 ) . These results strengthened our previous assumption that some cell - types have different anatomical phenotype in primary and prefrontal cortical regions . The different laminar distribution and molecular characteristics of mPFC NAc and mPFC VTA neurons suggest that these populations are mostly separated . However , previous publications yielded contradictory results about the target - selectivity of mPFC neurons , which can be resolved , if we consider that multiple projection was found to be high when the experiments were carried out in one neuron population ( e . g . , only IT or only PT neurons ) ( Thierry et al . , 1983 ; Ferino et al . , 1987 ; Cassell et al . , 1989 ; Vázquez - Borsetti et al . , 2011 ; Rojas - Piloni et al . , 2017 ) , but low when the experiments involved mixed populations ( e . g . , PT and IT neurons ) ( Pinto and Sesack , 2000 ; Gabbott et al . , 2005 ; Morishima and Kawaguchi , 2006 ; Kim et al . , 2017 ; Otis et al . , 2017 ; Cruz et al . , 2021 ) . Gao et al . ( 2020 ) found relatively high overlap between NAc - ( IT ) and VTA ( PT ) projecting neurons in the Cg1 , however , examining only a relatively small sample size . Recent publications ( Callaway et al . , 2021 ; Muñoz - Castañeda et al . , 2021 ; Peng et al . , 2021 ) showing extensive collateralization of fully reconstructed IT and PT neurons also suggest that cortical pyramidal neurons have a multiple - projecting nature . Collectively , these results imply that a single mPFC neuron is not target - selective , but target - preference can be identified at class , or subclass level . We directly tested this and found that retrogradely labelled mPFC Nac and mPFC VTA neurons showed minimal overlap ( < 2 % ) , indeed . Furthermore , using CAV2 - Cre - mediated viral tracing we demonstrated that mPFC NAc cells innervate the NAc approximately ten times stronger than the VTA . On the other hand , mPFC VTA neurons also showed clear preference ( 3 . 5 - fold ) for the VTA over the NAc . Considering that mPFC innervates the VTA with a relatively sparse axon - arborization ( Carr and Sesack , 2000 ; Geisler and Zahm , 2005 ) , these result further support that these populations are rather non - overlapping at the single - cell level . Complete projection pattern analysis revealed that these populations tend to innervate different areas throughout the brain . Specifically , mPFC NAc neurons showed IT - like projection pattern ( mainly ipsi - and contralateral cortical , amygdalar and striatal targets ) , while mPFC VTA efferents resembled PT neurons ( mainly ipsilateral mesencephalic and diencephalic targets ) . In general , mPFC NAc neurons participate in a range of reward - related tasks . For example , activation of mPFC NAc neurons suppresses reward seeking in a conflicting situation ( Kim et al . , 2017 ) . On the other hand , others reported that optical stimulation of mPFC NAc neurons promote conditioned reward seeking ( Otis et al . , 2017 ) . In accordance , Britt et al . ( 2012 ) demonstrated that optical stimulation of mPFC terminals in the NAc can facilitate self - stimulation , although Stuber and colleagues ( 2011 ) reported the lack of such effect . Therefore , it seems plausible that there is a topographical segregation within the mPFC - to - NAc pathway with different functional properties or different cell - types conveying different behavioral information , or the combination of both . Similarly , it was previously reported that mPFC neurons can excite and inhibit VTA dopamine neurons equally ( Lodge , 2011 ) , which also suggests functional separation within the mesocorticolimbic system . Recent findings of topographically biased input - output connectivity of different mPFC ( Cruz et al . , 2021 ) and VTA dopamine neurons ( Aransay et al . , 2015 ; Beier et al . , 2015 ) , as well as high topographic precision in corticostriatal pathways ( Hooks et al . , 2018 ) further support this suggestion . So , cell - specific studies are needed to completely clarify the functional complexity of these pathways . Taken together , mPFC NAc and mPFC VTA populations are rather non - overlapping and their afferent connectivity shows IT - and PT - like features , respectively . However , high CT marker ( FoxP2 ) expression in mPFC VTA neurons , as well as PT ( Ctip2 ) and CT ( Ntsr1 ) marker expression in mPFC NAc neurons indicate that the traditional IT - PT - CT classification is less evident in the mPFC . In accordance , recent publications also demonstrated high genetic diversity of cortical neurons ( Bakken et al . , 2021 ; Callaway et al . , 2021 ; Matho et al . , 2021 ; Zhang et al . , 2021 ) , even within projection neuron classes in primary cortices . Therefore , in the future , understanding the versatility of prefrontal cortical influence over mesocorticolimbic functions requires a combination of molecular - , cellular - , laminar - and region - specific approaches . Anatomical considerations It is generally accepted that the rodent mPFC is anatomically homologous to the primate anterior cingulate cortex ( Russo and Nestler , 2013 ; Vogt and Paxinos , 2014 ) . However , there are notable nomenclatural inconsistencies ( Laubach et al . , 2018 ; Le Merre et al . , 2021 ) in the rodent mPFC literature ( Lodge , 2011 ; Bossert et al . , 2012 ; Adhikari et al . , 2015 ; Shrestha et al . , 2015 ; Warren et al . , 2019 ; Lichtenberg et al . , 2021 ) . For example , the exact definition of the PrL subregions greatly varies between publications , just like the distinction between dorsal and ventral mPFC . Such inaccuracies can contribute to the still abundant contradictions in the literature and complicate the proper interpretation of the results . To overcome these setbacks , we combined multiple IHC Fluo against different molecular markers that can ( 1 ) delineate the borders between different subregions ( PV , Calb1 ) ( van Brederode et al . , 1991 ; Sun et al . , 2002 ; Akhter et al . , 2014 ; Mátyás et al . , 2014 ) and ( 2 ) clearly define cortical layers in the mPFC ( Calb1 , Ctip2 , FoxP2 ) ( Ferland et al . , 2003 ; Kim et al . , 2017 ) . We always used these markers to locate injection sites and labelled neurons within the mPFC . Reliable primary antibodies raised in several different species against all of these markers are commercially available and they can be combined easily . Therefore , we suggest the general adoption of this method to precisely define and separate mPFC subregions and layers in future studies .

Animals were group housed in a humidity - and temperature - controlled environment . Animals were entrained to a 12 h light / dark cycle ( light phase from 07 : 00 AM ) with food and water available ad libitum . All procedures were approved by the Regional and Institutional Committee of the Research Centre for Natural Sciences . Stereotactic surgeries Classical retrograde tracing . All animals were anesthetized under ketamine - xylazine ( 5 : 1 , 3x dilution , ketamine : 100 mg / kg ; xylazine : 4 mg / kg ) during all anatomical surgeries . Single and double retrograde tracing surgeries were carried out with 0 . 5 % Cholera Toxin B subunit ( CTB ; List Biological Laboratories : 104 ) and / or 2 % Fluoro - Gold ( FG ; Fluorochrome LLC ) to reveal the prefrontal cortical source of NAc ( AP / L / DV : + 1 . 4 / ±0 . 8 / 3 . 9 - 4 . 2 ) and VTA ( AP / L / DV : - 3 . 3 / ±0 . 3 / 4 . 0 - 4 . 2 ) innervation . Tracers were iontophoretically injected ( 7 - 7 sec on / off duty cycle , 3 - 5 µA , for 5 - 10 min ) with IonFlow Bipolar electrophoretic equipment ( Supertech Instruments Hungary ) . After all surgeries , animals received Rimadyl ( Carprofen , 1 . 4 mg / kg ) . For anatomical analysis , after 7 days of survival time , mice were perfused transcardially first with saline ( ~ 50 ml ) , then , with ~ 150 ml of fixative solution containing 4 % paraformaldehyde ( Sigma ) in 0 . 1 M phosphate buffer ( PB ) . Animals in which the injections sites or tracer tracks reached regions that could affect labelling ( e . g . : caudate putamen , substantia nigra , ventral pallidum ) were excluded from further analysis . Identification of different brain regions and cortical layers . We used different neurochemical markers to identify brain regions of interest and to separate cortical layers in the tissue samples labelled with fluorescent immunohistochemistry ( IHC Fluo ) . Calbindin ( Calb1 ) staining ( see below ) was used to delineate the core ( strong Calb1 expression ) and shell ( weak Calb1 expression ) region of the NAc ( Jongen - Rêlo et al . , 1994 ) , and tyrosine hydroxylase ( TH ) staining for the VTA ( Oades and Halliday , 1987 ; Morales and Margolis , 2017 ) . Layer 2 / 3 ( L2 / 3 ) of the cerebral cortex was identified using Calb1 staining ( van Brederode et al . , 1991 ; Sun et al . , 2002 ) , while L6 with forkhead box protein P2 ( FoxP2 ) staining ( Ferland et al . , 2003 ) . COUP - TF - interacting protein 2 ( Ctip2 ) staining was used to label L5b and L6 ( DeNardo et al . , 2015 ) ( Fig . 1 - 1 ) . We used the 2nd Edition of the Mouse Brain is Stereotaxic Coordinates by Paxinos and Franklin ( 2001 ) as a reference , because the vast majority of mPFC literature uses this nomenclature . In comparison with the newest , 5th edition ( Franklin and Paxinos , 2019 ) , the mPFC region we defined as prelimbic cortex ( PrL ) is approximately equivalent to the A32 area , the infralimbic cortex ( IL ) to the A25 , and the rostral aspects of the cingulate cortex , area 1 and 2 ( Cg1 - 2 ) to the A24b and A24a , respectively . The secondary motor ( M2 ) , medial orbital ( MO ) , dorsal peduncular cortex ( DP ) and dorsal tenia tecta ( DTT ) regions have not changed significantly between the two editions . Anterograde viral tracing . For cell type - specific anterograde viral tracing AAV5 . EF1a . DIO . eYFP . WPRE . hGH ( 30 - 100 nl ; Penn Vector Core ; # 27056 - AAV5 ; titer : 5 * 10 12 GC / ml ) or AAV5 - EF1a - DIO - mCherry viruses ( 30 - 100 nl ; UNC Vector Core ; # 50462 ; titer : 7 * 10 12 GC / ml ) were injected at a rate of 0 . 5 - 1 nl / sec into mPFC ( AP / L / DV : + 1 . 7 - 1 . 9 / ±0 . 3 / 2 . 1 - 1 . 6 mm ) and M1 ( AP / L / DV : + 1 . 4 / ±1 . 6 / 1 . 3 - 1 . 0 mm ) using a Nanoliter Injector ( World Precision Instruments , FL , USA ) . Animals were perfused ( see above ) after 4 - 6 weeks of survival time . Viral expression was always analyzed after IHC Fluo - enhancement ( Fig . 3 - 1 ) ( Falcy et al . , 2020 ) , even for eYFP ( see below ) . Intersectional retro - anterograde viral tracing . In order to selectively label NAc - projecting ( mPFC NAc ) and VTA - projecting mPFC cells ( mPFC VTA ) , we injected Canine adenovirus type 2 carrying Cre - recombinase gene ( CAV2 - Cre , CMV promoter , titer : 2 . 5 * 10 10 pp / ml , Plateforme de Vectorologie de Montpellier , France ; a gift from D . Zelena ) into the NAc ( n = 3 animals ) or VTA ( n = 3 animals ) ( see coordinates above ) of wild - type animals , mixed with 5 % biotinylated dextrane amine ( BDA , MW : 10 . 000 , Molecular Probes : D1956 , RRID : AB _ 2307337 ; 1 : 1 ; 80 - 120 nl / animal ; 1nl / sec ) . Note that BDA was used to locate the tip of the injecting pipette ( Fig . 5B1 , C1 ) , not the whole extent of viral diffusion . At the same time , the mPFC ( see coordinates above ) of the same animals was injected with AAV5 - EF1a - DIO - mCherry ( see details above ) . After 6 weeks of survival , animals were perfused , and their brains were processed for further analysis ( see above ) . Tissue processing and immunohistochemistry Tissue blocks were cut on a VT1200S Vibratome ( Leica ) into 50 µm coronal sections . Free - floating sections were intensively washed with 0 . 1 M PB . All antibodies were diluted in 0 . 1 M PB . For fluorescent labeling , sections were first treated with a blocking solution containing 10 % normal donkey serum ( NDS , Sigma - Aldrich : S30 - M ) or 10 % normal goat serum ( NGS , Vector : S - 1000 , RRID : AB _ 2336615 ) and 0 . 5 % Triton - X in 0 . 1 M PB for 30 minutes at room temperature ( RT ) . Fluorescent immunohistochemistry . Sections were incubated in primary antibody solution overnight at RT or for 2 - 3 days at 4°C . The following primary antibodies were used : green fluorescent protein ( GFP , chicken , Life Technology : A10262 , RRID : AB _ 2534023 ; 1 : 2000 ) , mCherry ( mCherry ; rabbit , BioVision : 5993 - 100 , RRID : AB _ 1975001 ; 1 : 2000 ) , red fluorescent protein ( RFP ; rat , Chromotek : 5F8 , RRID : AB _ 2336064 ; 1 : 2000 ) FoxP2 ( mouse , Merck Millipore : MABE415 , RRID : AB _ 2721039 ; 1 : 2000 ; Invitrogen : MA5 - 31419 , RRID : AB _ 2787055 ; 1 : 2000 ; rabbit , Abcam : ab16046 , RRID : AB _ 2107107 ; 1 : 500 ) , Calb1 ( rabbit , SWANT : CB38 , RRID : AB _ 10000340 ; 1 : 2000 ; mouse , SWANT : 300 , RRID : AB _ 10000347 ; 1 : 2000 ; chicken , Synaptic Systems : 214 006 , RRID : AB _ 2619903 ; 1 : 2000 ) , TH ( mouse , Immunostar : 22941 , RRID : AB _ 572268 ; 1 : 8000 ) , FG ( rabbit , FluoroChrome , 1 : 50 . 000 ; guinea pig , Protos Biotech : NM - 101 , RRID : AB _ 2314409 ; 1 : 5000 ) , CTB ( goat , List Biological Laboratories : 703 ; 1 : 20 . 000 ) , parvalbumin ( PV ; mouse , SWANT : PV 235 , RRID : AB _ 10000343 ; 1 : 2000 ) and Ctip2 ( rat , Abcam : ab18465 , RRID : AB _ 2064130 ; 1 : 500 ) . For IHC Fluo staining , after primary antibody incubation , sections were treated with the following secondary IgGs ( 1 : 500 ; 2 hours at RT ) : Alexa 488 - conjugated donkey anti - rabbit ( DAR - A488 ; Jackson : 711 - 545 - 152 , RRID : AB _ 2313584 ) , donkey anti - mouse ( Jackson : 715 - 545 - 150 , RRID : AB _ 2340846 ) , goat anti - chicken ( Molecular Probes : A11039 , RRID : AB _ 142924 ) , donkey anti - guinea pig ( Jackson : 706 - 545 - 148 , RRID : AB _ 2340472 ) ; Alexa 555 - conjugated donkey anti - goat ( Molecular Probes : A21432 , RRID : AB _ 141788 ) , donkey anti - mouse ( Molecular Probes : A31570 , RRID : AB _ 2536180 ) , donkey anti - rat ( Southern Biotech : 6430 - 32 , RRID : AB _ 2796359 ) ; Cy3 - conjugated donkey anti - rabbit ( Jackson : 715 - 165 - 152 , RRID : AB _ 2307443 ) , donkey anti - mouse ( Jackson : 715 - 165 - 151 , RRID : AB _ 2340813 ) ; Alexa 594 - conjugated donkey anti - mouse ( Molecular Probes : A21203 , RRID : AB _ 141633 ) , donkey anti - rabbit ( Molecular Probes : A21207 , RRID : AB _ 141637 ) , Alexa 647 - conjugated donkey anti - mouse ( Jackson : 715 - 605 - 151 , RRID : AB _ 2340863 ; Invitrogen : A - 31571 , RRID : AB _ 162542 ) or donkey anti - rabbit ( Jackson : 711 - 605 - 152 , RRID : AB _ 2492288 ) . When necessary , staining was enhanced after primary antibody incubation with biotinylated secondary antibodies ( biotinylated horse anti - goat IgG , Vector Laboratories : BA - 9500 , RRID : AB _ 2336123 ; 1 : 300 ; biotinylated goat anti - rabbit – bGAR , Vector Laboratories : BA - 1000 , RRID : AB _ 2313606 ; 1 : 300 ; biotinylated goat anti - guinea pig , Vector Laboratories : BA - 7000 , RRID : AB _ 2336132 ; 1 : 300 ; 1 . 5h , RT ) , Elite Avidin - Biotin Complex ( eABC , 1 : 300 , Vector Laboratories : PK - 6100 , RRID : AB _ 2336819 ; 1 . 5h , RT ) and streptavidin conjugated fluorescent antibodies ( SA - A488 , Jackson : 016 - 540 - 084 , RRID : AB _ 2337249 ; 1 : 2000 ; SA - Cy3 , Jackson : 016 - 160 - 084 , RRID : AB _ 2337244 ; 1 : 2000 ; SA - A647 , Jackson : 016 - 600 - 084 , RRID : AB _ 2341101 ; 1 : 2000 ; 2 hrs , RT ) . All fluorescent slices were mounted in Vectashield ( Vector Laboratories : H - 1000 , RRID : AB _ 2336789 ) . To reveal the CAV2 - Cre / BDA injection site we used eABC ( see above ) and SA - A488 or SA - A647 ( see above ) . Immunoperoxidase staining . For the whole - brain projection pattern analysis of the CAV2 - Cre animals , we also performed immunoperoxidase staining and used nickel - amplified diaminobenzidine ( DAB ) technique ( DAB - Ni ; IHC DAB - Ni ) . Every 6 th section ( thus , at 300 µm resolution , from Br . + 3 . 10 to - 8 . 00 mm ) was treated first with 1 % H 2 O 2 solution for 10 minutes , then , after intensive washing , in 10 % NDS and 0 . 2 % Triton - X solution as a blocking serum ( 30 mins , RT ) . After primary antibody incubation ( mCherry , see above ) , slices were incubated in biotinylated secondary antibody ( bGAR ) and eABC ( see above ) . Then we developed DAB - Ni for 5 minutes . Sections were then dehydrated in xylol ( 2 * 10 mins ) and mounted in DePex ( Serva , Heidelberg , Germany ) . Viral signal amplification . To compare native mCherry expression to IHC Fluo and IHC DAB - Ni enhancement , we stained slices from the CAV2 - Cre experiments with primary antibody against mCherry and DAR - A488 ( see above ) ( Fig . 3 - 1 A - B ) . Then we captured confocal images ( see below ) from the same brain regions in two channels ( i . e . , A488 and mCherry ) . For better visualization , we recolorized the A488 channel at Fig . 3 - 1 A2 , B2 . Next , we stained the neighboring slices ( i . e . , 50 µm apart ) with IHC DAB - Ni against mCherry ( see above ) and captured them with brightfield microscopy ( see below ) ( Fig . 3 - 1 C - D ) . Microscopy Fluorescent sections were first analyzed with epifluorescent microscope ( Leica DM 2500 , Leica Microsystems GmbH ; Camera : Olympus DP73 , CellSens Entry 1 . 16 , Olympus Corporation ) with low magnification ( 2 . 5x N PLAN 2 . 5x / 0 . 07 ∞ / - / OFN25 , 5x HCX FL PLAN 5x / 0 . 12 ∞ / - / B ) to find injection sites and labelled cells . Higher magnification ( 10x Plan Apochromat 10x / 0 . 45 M27 ; 20x Plan Apochromat 20x / 0 . 8 M27 , 63x Plan Apochromat 63x / 1 . 4 Oil DIC M27 ) images were taken with confocal microscope ( Zeiss LSM 710 ; Zeiss ZEN 2010B SP1 Release version 6 . 0 ; Carl Zeiss Microimaging GmbH ) . Brightfield imaging and whole brain projection analysis was completed with a PANORAMIC MIDI II ( 20x ( NA 0 . 8 ) ; 3DHistech , Hungary ) device and the manufacturer’s official software ( CaseViewer 2 . 4 ) for every 6th slice ( i . e . , at 300 µm resolution ) . Colocalization . In order to reveal the proportion of FoxP2 - , Ctip2 - and Calb1 - positive cells among retrogradely ( FG / CTB ) labelled mPFC NAc and mPFC VTA cells , we captured 20x magnification confocal Z - stack ( step size : 5 µm ) imaging of double - labelled fluorescent sections ( 3 - 4 slices / animal , n = 3 - 3 animals ) . Labelled cells were then manually analyzed with ImageJ ( NIH ) . Only cells visible in two separate sections with a visible nucleus were analyzed . The same protocol was used to identify double - labelled cells in the double retrograde tracing experiments ( n = 3 animals ) . Axon density analysis . We sought to compare mPFC axon densities in the NAc and VTA in the CAV2 - Cre injected mPFC NAc , mPFC VTA , and AAV5 - EF1a - DIO - mCherry injected Rbp4 - ( mPFC Rbp4 ) and Thy1 - Cre ( mPFC Thy1 ) samples using high - magnification ( 63x ) confocal Z - stacks ( step size : 0 . 27 µm ) . In the VTA we captured three stacks in each animal ( n = 3 in each strain ) at three different AP levels between Bregma - 3 . 10 and - 3 . 80 mm . In the NAc , we captured five - five stacks in the same animals as for the VTA at three different AP levels between Bregma + 1 . 00 - 1 . 80 mm . We aimed to capture stacks where axon density was visibly the highest at each AP levels in each region . We analyzed the confocal stacks using a custom made automatic ImageJ macro ( Mátyás et al . , 2018 ) . The macro calculated the axon length for each stack and the total axon length was summated for each brain region in each animal . Then , the total axon length was compared to the summated stack volume ( ROI area * number of slices * step size = total volume ) for each brain region to calculate the relative axon density ( RAD = total axon length / total volume ) . Then , the ratio of RAD VTA / RAD NAc ( RAD ( VTA / NAc ) ) was calculated for each animal , where RAD ( VTA / NAc ) = 1 means that the two areas are equally innervated . Statistical analysis Values are given as mean ± SD in all figures . n represents number of animals ; N represents cell counts . We used SPSS Statistics ( ver . 27 . 0 . 1 . 0 . , IBM ) to analyze the axon - density data . We used one - way ANOVA method with LSD post - hoc test to compare relative axon - density values after testing for the homogeneity of variances . * p < 0 . 05 , * * * p < 0 . 001 . mPFC NAc Layers Total 2 / 3 5a 5b 6 C a l b 1 # FG + / animal 128 , 101 , 60 287 , 200 , 168 415 , 301 , 228 # Calb1 + / animal 84 , 71 , 42 7 , 4 , 7 91 , 75 , 49 % Calb1 + ( AVG ± SD ) 68 . 6 ± 2 . 6 % 2 . 9 ± 1 . 1 % 22 . 8 ± 1 . 9 % C t i p 2 # FG + / animal 62 , 356 , 349 37 , 29 , 138 99 , 385 , 487 # Ctip2 + / animal 9 , 9 , 27 22 , 20 , 88 31 , 29 , 115 % Ctip2 + ( AVG ± SD ) 8 . 26 ± 6 . 01 % 64 . 1 ± 4 . 76 % 20 . 8 ± 12 . 1 % F o x P 2 # FG + / animal 288 , 357 , 173 20 , 24 , 0 308 , 381 , 173 # FoxP2 + / animal 5 , 10 , 0 4 , 3 , 0 9 , 13 , 0 % FoxP2 + ( AVG ± SD ) 1 . 5 ± 1 . 4 % - * 2 . 1 ± 1 . 8 % Table 1 .
