Posted on 12 February 2016 ABSTRACT Integrin - mediated activation of small GTPases induces the polymerisation of G - actin into various actin structures and the release of the transcriptional co - activator MRTF from G - actin . Here we report that β1 - and / or αV - class integrin expressing pan - integrin - null fibroblasts seeded on fibronectin ( FN ) contained different G - actin pools , nuclear MRTF - A levels and MRTF - A / SRF activities . The nuclear MRTF - A levels and activities were highest in cells expressing both integrin classes , lower in cells expressing β1 - class integrins and lowest in cells expressing the  V - class integrins . Quantitative proteomics and transcriptomics analyses linked the differential MRTF - A activities to the expression of the ubiquitin - like modifier interferon - stimulated gene 15 ( ISG15 ) , which is known to modify FA and cytoskeletal proteins . The malignant breast cancer cell line MDA - MB - 231 expressed high levels of β1 integrins , ISG15 and ISGylated proteins , which promoted invasive properties , while non - invasive MDA - MB - 468 and MCF - 7 cell lines expressed low levels of β1 integrins , ISG15 and ISGylated proteins . Our findings suggest that integrin adhesion - induced MRTF - A / SRF activation and ISG15 expression constitute a new signalling circuit that promotes cell migration and invasion . J o u r n a l o f C e ll S c i e n c e • A d v a n c e a r t i c l e INTRODUCTION Integrin - mediated cell adhesion and signalling control numerous cellular processes , which are crucial for development , postnatal homeostasis and influence diverse pathological processes such as cancer development and metastasis ( Hynes , 2002 ; Winograd - Katz et al . , 2014 ) . Integrin signalling is a multistep process that is initiated with integrin activation and ligand binding , followed by integrin clustering and the progressive assembly of signalling platforms consisting of adaptor , signalling / catalytic and cytoskeletal proteins ( Legate et al . , 2009 ) . The first integrin - based adhesion sites are small and short - lived and termed nascent adhesions ( NAs ) . They eventually mature into large and stable focal adhesions ( FAs ) that are connected to filamentous ( F - ) actin ( Vicente - Manzanares et al . , 2009 ) . Integrin signalling induces both short - and long - term effects in cells ( Legate et al . , 2009 ) . The short - term effects mainly affect cytoskeletal rearrangements that allow cells to adopt their characteristic shape and initiate migration , and are to a large extent triggered by the activation of Rho family GTPases and actin - binding proteins ( Danen et al . , 2002 ) . Long - term effects of integrin signalling result from changes in gene expression , which regulate numerous cellular processes including proliferation and differentiation ( Legate et al . , 2009 ) . Integrin - dependent regulation of gene expression is primarily thought to arise from cross talk with growth factor receptors that increase the activity of mitogen - activated protein ( MAP ) kinase pathways . A recent study , however , reported that integrins can also control gene transcription by releasing the association of the transcriptional co - activator myocardin - related transcription factor - A ( MRTF - A ) from monomeric or globular ( G - ) actin ( Miralles et al . , 2003 ; Plessner et al . , 2015 ) . MRTF - A belongs to the myocardin - related family of transcriptional co - activators , which consists of myocardin , MRTFA - A / MKL1 / MAL and MRTF - B / MKL2 . MRTF - A and MRTF - B can bind monomeric G - actin , which retains them in the cytoplasm and from binding to SRF . Once G - actin is polymerized into different actin networks , MRTF - A / B are released from cytoplasmic and nuclear G - actin , associate with the transcription factor serum response factor ( SRF ) and regulate the expression of cytoskeletal proteins including actin and numerous FA proteins ( Esnault et al . , 2014 ; Posern and Treisman , 2006 ) . In the present paper we investigated whether fibronectin ( FN ) - binding integrins of the αV - and β1 - class can regulate MRTF / SRF activity . To this end we used integrin - deficient fibroblasts ( pan - knockouts , pKO cells ) that were reconstituted with αv and / or β1 integrin cDNAs giving rise to cells that express αVβ3 and αVβ5 ( pKO - αV cells ) , cells that express α5β1 ( pKO - β1 ) , and cells that express both integrin classes ( pKO - αV , β1 cells ) . We have shown in a previous paper that reconstituting cells with different FN - binding integrins results in the formation of different types of adhesion sites and the induction of different actin structures ( Schiller et al . , 2013 ) . Whereas the pKO - αV cells form large FAs and primarily activate Rho - J o u r n a l o f C e ll S c i e n c e • A d v a n c e a r t i c l e mDia - mediated actin polymerisation leading to thick , transversal stress fibers , pKO - β1 cells assemble small NAs along the cell edge , activate Rac , induce dense cortical actin networks and lamellipodia and link Rho primarily to myosin II activation . pKO - αV , β1 cells develop NAs , a cortical actin network at the cell edge and lamellipodia , and FAs associated with stress fibers and high myosin II activity ( Schiller et al . , 2013 ) . Using these cell lines we demonstrate that αV - and β1 - class integrins synergize to induce high activation of MRTF / SRF and expression of target genes . We also identify the ubiquitin - like modifier Interferon - specific gene 15 ( ISG15 ) as a novel integrin - induced MRTF / SRF target gene , and find that high levels of FN - binding integrins and ISG15 promote the invasion of the malignant breast cancer line MDA - MB - 231 and correlate with poor survival rates in a large cohort of breast cancer patients . J o u r n a l o f C e ll S c i e n c e • A d v a n c e a r t i c l e RESULTS Fibronectin - binding integrins differentially regulate actin distribution and G / F ratios To assess whether FN - binding integrins differentially regulate MRTF - A / SRF activity , we seeded pKO - αV , pKO - β1 , pKO - αV , β1 cells ( Schiller et al . , 2013 ) on FN and analysed the levels and distribution of MRTF - A , G - and F - actin . Western blots of whole cell lysates revealed significantly higher levels of β - actin in pKO - αV cells compared to pKO - β1 and pKO - αV , β1 cells ( Fig . 1A , B ) , and staining with fluorescently labelled phalloidin showed that pKO - αV and pKO - αV , β1 cells developed thick stress fibers , while pKO - β1 contained thin stress fibers on FN - coated culture dishes and micropatterns ( Fig . 1C , S1A ) . Furthermore , pKO - β1 and pKO - αV , β1 cells formed multiple lamellipodia with subcortical actin networks , which were rarely seen in pKO - αV cells ( Fig . 1C ) . Visualisation of cytoplasmic G - actin with fluorescently labelled DNAseI revealed high cytoplasmic signals in pKO - αV and lower signals in pKO - β1 and pKO - αV , β1 cells ( Fig . 1D ) . To quantify the G - and F - actin levels in our cell lines , we performed cell fractionation assays followed by Western blotting and found that the soluble fractions ( G , containing G - actin and positive for GAPDH ) contained higher β - actin levels in pKO - αV cells compared to pKO - β1 and pKO - αV , β1 cells ( Fig . 1E ) , while the cytoskeletal fractions ( F , containing F - actin and positive for Vimentin ) contained highest β - actin levels in pKO - αv , β1 , intermediate in pKO - β1 and lowest in pKO - αV cells ( Fig . 1E ) . The calculated G / F - actin ratio from 9 different Western blot analyses was significantly higher in pKO - αV cells compared to pKO - β1 and pKO - αV , β1 cells ( Fig . 1F ) . To determine monomeric G - actin levels in the cytoplasm and nucleus , respectively , we prepared soluble and nuclear cell fractions and performed sepharose - coupled DNaseI pull - downs followed by Western blotting with anti - β - actin antibodies . The experiments revealed that in both compartments the G - actin levels were highest in pKO - αV , intermediate in pKO - β1 and lowest in pKO - αV , β1 cells ( Fig . 1G - I ) . Importantly , BSA - coupled control beads pulled down β - actin from neither subcellular fraction ( Fig . 1G ) , and FACS analysis excluded nuclear size differences between our cell lines as a possible cause for the different nuclear G - actin contents ( Fig . S1B ) . Re - analysis of our previously published whole cell - and phospho - proteome of pKO - αV , pKO - β1 and pKO - αV , β1 cells ( Schiller et al . , 2013 ) revealed significantly elevated levels of Thymosin β4 ( Tβ4 ) and phospho - Serine - 3 ( pSer3 ) - cofilin in β1 - expressing cells ( Fig . S1C - E ) indicating that G - actin is significantly more sequestered by the high Tβ4 levels and F - actin less severed by the pronounced inactivation of cofilin in pKO - β1 and pKO - αV , β1 cells compared to pKO - αV cells , which is further decreasing the free G - actin contents in pKO - β1 and pKO - αV , β1 cells . Altogether , these results show that FN - binding integrin classes differentially regulate cellular G - / F - actin contents . J o u r n a l o f C e ll S c i e n c e • A d v a n c e a r t i c l e Fibronectin - binding integrins differentially regulate nuclear MRTF - A levels MRTF - A is a transcriptional co - activator that is sequestered in the cytoplasm through binding G - actin and released upon actin polymerisation ( Posern and Treisman , 2006 ) . Therefore , the different levels of monomeric G - actin in pKO - αV , pKO - β1 and pKO - αV , β1 cells may correlate with different MRTF - A distributions . To test this hypothesis , we stained the cells with specific rabbit polyclonal anti - MRTF - A antibodies ( Descot et al . , 2009 ) . Indeed , nuclear MRTF - A levels were lowest in pKO - αV , intermediate in pKO - β1 and highest in pKO - αV , β1 cells ( Fig . 2A ) . Treatment with Jasplakinolide , which polymerizes free G - actin and stabilizes actin filaments ( Fig . 2B , Fig . S1F ) , increased nuclear MRTF - A localization , while treatment with Latrunculin A , which increases monomeric G - actin by depolymerizing F - actin , decreased nuclear MRTF - A levels in all three cell lines ( Fig . 2C , Fig . S1F ) . To quantify MRTF - A levels in the cytoplasm and nucleus , the lysates of the respective cell fractions were analysed by immunoblotting using anti - MRTF - A antibodies . Western blot analysis revealed weak nuclear MRTF - A signals in pKO - αV cells , intermediate signals in pKO - β1 cells and highest signals in pKO - αV , β1 cells ( Fig . 2D ) . Similarly , the nuclear / cytoplasmic ratios of MRTF - A were significantly higher in pKO - αV , β1 cells compared to pKO - β1 and especially pKO - αV cells ( Fig . 2E ) . These results show that FN - binding integrin classes differentially regulate nuclear MRTF - A levels . αV - and β1 - class integrins cooperate to control MRTF - A / SRF activity To test the functional consequences of the different nuclear MRTF - A contents in our three cell lines , we first measured MRTF / SRF transcriptional activity using luciferase reporter assays ( Busche et al . , 2008 ) . The assays revealed low SRF reporter activity in pKO - αV cells , 5 - fold higher activity in pKO - β1 cells and ~ 10 fold higher activities in pKO - αV , β1 cells ( Fig . 3A ) . Serum treatment , which is known to induce nuclear translocation of MRTF - A , increased SRF reporter activities in pKO - β1 and pKO - αV , β1 cells to a much higher extent compared to pKO - αV cells ( Fig . S2A ) , suggesting that β1 integrin - mediated adhesion in cooperation with serum or growth factor - signaling facilitates maximal MRTF / SRF activity . Overexpression of a dominant - negative version of MRTF - A reduced SRF reporter activity to basal levels in the three cell lines ( Fig . S2B ) , while overexpression of a G - actin binding - deficient MRTF - A ( ∆N - MRTF - A ) or a constitutive active mDia , which catalyses actin polymerization , increased MRTF / SRF - driven luciferase activities to similar extents in all three cell lines ( Fig . 3A ) . Cell spreading defects can also lead to reduced nuclear MRTF - A localization and MRTF / SRF reporter activities ( Connelly et al . , 2010 ) . To exclude that the spreading defects of pKO - αV cells ( Schiller et al . , 2013 ) were responsible for the reduced MRTF - A activities we seeded the three cell lines on FN - coated circular micropatterns with 28μm or 40μm diameters ( which have twice the surface area of 28μm sized patterns ) , J o u r n a l o f C e ll S c i e n c e • A d v a n c e a r t i c l e and performed SRF luciferase reporter assays and immunostainings . The experiments revealed that pKO - αV cells displayed similarly low SRF reporter activities and nuclear MRTF - A levels on small as well as large FN - coated circular micropatterns , while pKO - β1 and pKO - αV , β1 cells exhibited increased SRF activities and nuclear MRTF - A levels on 40µm sized micropatterns compared to 28µm sized micropatterns ( Fig . 3B - C ) . Altogether these results indicate that reduced spreading of pKO - αV cells is not responsible for their low MRTF / SRF activity . Next we investigated whether changes in the activities of FN - binding integrin classes affect SRF reporter activity . First , we activated integrins by treating the cells with Mn 2 + , which significantly elevated SRF reporter activity in all three cell lines , most prominently in pKO - β1 and pKO - αV , β1 cells ( Fig . 3D ) . Second , we inhibited individual integrin classes in pKO - αV , β1 cells , either with antibodies or peptidomimetics that block specific classes of FN - binding integrins . After seeding pKO - αV , β1 cells on FN ( bound by αV - and β1 - class integrins ) , Vitronectin ( VN ) or Gelatin ( both ligands bound by αV - class integrins only ) , they were treated with either anti - α5β1 blocking antibodies or the αV - class specific small molecule inhibitor cilengitide and immunostained for MRTF - A . The experiments showed that inhibition of either α5β1 or αVβ3 Integrins on FN adherent pKO - αV , β1 cells significantly reduced nuclear MRTF - A levels and thus phenocopied the situation in pKO - αV or pKO - β1 cells ( Fig . 3E , S2C ) and confirmed the synergistic role of both FN - binding integrin classes for nuclear MRTF - A accumulation . Similarly , when pKO - αV , β1 cells were seeded on VN and Gelatin , respectively , they showed weak nuclear MRTF - A signals , which was not further decreased by blocking the function of α5β1 integrin ( Fig . S2C ) . Treatment of VN - or Gelatin - seeded pKO - αV , β1 cells with cilengitide blocked cell adhesion ( Fig . S2C ) . Altogether these data indicate that αV - and β1 - class integrins cooperate to maximise MRTF - A / SRF activity . αV - and β1 - class integrins cooperate to promote transcription of MRTF / SRF target genes The high nuclear MRTF - A content and SRF activity in pKO - αV , β1 cells suggest that MRTF - A / SRF - induced gene transcription is controlled , at least in part , by a cooperation of αV - and β1 - class integrins . To test this possibility , we compared published MRTF / SRF transcriptomes ( Balza and Misra , 2006 ; Cooper et al . , 2007 ; Descot et al . , 2009 ; Philippar et al . , 2004 ; Selvaraj and Prywes , 2004 ; Sun et al . , 2006 ; Zhang et al . , 2005 ) with the whole cell proteome data of pKO - αV , pKO - β1 and pKO - αV , β1 cells ( Schiller et al . , 2013 ) and found a large number of MRTF / SRF targets including SRF itself and FA proteins such as Vinculin and Talin - 1 enriched in pKO - β1 and pKO - αV , β1 cells ( Table I ) . The increased levels of SRF , Talin - 1 and Vinculin mRNA and protein in pKO - β1 and pKO - αV , β1 cells were confirmed by qRT - PCR and Western blotting ( Fig . 4A , B ) . We also noted that the Isg15 mRNA and protein was significantly higher in pKO - αV , β1 cells , compared to pKO - αV cells ( Fig . 4A ; Table I ) and that its mRNA was previously shown to be downregulated upon SRF - J o u r n a l o f C e ll S c i e n c e • A d v a n c e a r t i c l e deletion in mouse embryonic stem ( ES ) cells ( Philippar et al . , 2004 ) . Western blotting confirmed high ISG15 levels in pKO - αV , β1 , intermediate levels in pKO - β1 and low levels in pKO - αV cells ( Fig . 4B , C ) . Although it has been reported that ISG15 can be secreted we did not detect ISG15 in the supernatant of either cell line ( Fig . S3A ) . Immunostainings also detected high ISG15 levels in pKO - αV , β1 and low levels in pKO - αV cells . The immunostaining also demonstrated that ISG15 co - localised with F - actin fibres , with the actin cortex in membrane protrusions ( Fig . 4D ) and with Paxillin in FAs of unroofed cells ( Fig . 4E ) . ISG15 is an ubiquitin - like modifier , whose expression is induced by type I ( α and β ) interferons ( Farrell et al . , 1979 ; Haas et al . , 1987 ) . While ELISA and qRT - PCR excluded expression of interferon α and β by pKO - αV , β1 cells as cause for the high ISG15 levels ( Fig . S3B - E ) , Poly ( I : C ) treatment induced interferon α and β expression ( Fig . S3B - E ) , which in turn triggered a strong Isg15 expression ( Fig . S3F ) . To demonstrate that Isg15 is an MRTF / SRF target gene , we searched for SRF consensus binding sites ( CArG box ) in the mouse Isg15 locus and performed chromatin - immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) assays . The mouse Isg15 gene contains a CArG box in the first intron ( Fig . 4F ) . The MRTF / SRF targets vinculin and talin - 1 were used as controls and gapdh as a negative control ( Vartiainen et al . , 2007 ) . ChIP samples were obtained using either anti - MRTF - A , anti - SRF or control IgG antibodies and the resulting chromatin DNA samples were PCR amplified with primers flanking the indicated CArG boxes of Isg15 , talin - 1 and vinculin ( Fig . 4F ) . As expected the gapdh gene was not amplified and control rabbit IgG precipitates did not produce PCR products ( Fig . 4G , H ) . αV - and β1 - class integrin - induced MRTF - A / SRF activity and ISG15 levels promote cell migration MRTF - A / SRF and ISG15 are up - regulated in cancer and promote tumor cell invasion ( Desai et al . , 2012 ; Kressner et al . , 2013 ) . To test whether the invasive properties of MRTF - A and ISG15 are associated and triggered by β1 integrin - mediated adhesion we compared the integrin expression profile , nuclear MRTF - A and ISG15 levels between the , non - invasive MCF - 7 ( luminal type ) and the low invasive MDA - MB - 468 ( basal - A type ) and highly invasive MDA - MB - 231 ( basal - B type ) breast carcinoma cell lines ( Neve et al . , 2006 ) . FACS analysis revealed significantly higher α5 and β1 levels and higher Integrin β1 activity ( shown with the activation - epitope binding 9EG7 antibody ) on MDA - MB - 231 cells compared to MCF - 7 cells ( Fig . 5A ) . Interestingly , the low invasive MDA - MB - 468 cells demonstrated no detectable α5 and low total and active β1 surface levels ( Fig . 5A ) . The levels of αV integrin were significantly elevated in MDA - MB - 468 and MCF - 7 cells compared to MDA - MB - 231 cells ( Fig . 5A ) . To test whether the high β1 integrin levels and activity in MDA - MB - 231 cells are associated with high nuclear MRTF - A activity we stained for F - actin and MRTF - A , and investigated MRTF / SRF activity with luciferase reporter assays . We found that MDA - MB - 468 cells spread poorly , contained cortical F - actin rings and showed high cytoplasmic and low nuclear MRTF - J o u r n a l o f C e ll S c i e n c e • A d v a n c e a r t i c l e A signals , while MCF7 cells were well spread , formed tight , F - actin rich cell - cell contacts and contained MRTF - A in the cytoplasm as well as in the nucleus ( Fig . 5B ) . In contrast , MDA - MB - 231 cells were not adhering to each other , contained numerous F - actin stress fibres throughout the cytoplasm and almost the entire pool of MRTF - A protein was detected in the nucleus ( Fig . 5B , C ) . In line with high nuclear MRTF - A levels , MDA - MB - 231 cells also displayed significantly higher MRTF / SRF reporter activity ( Fig . 5D ) and expressed significantly higher levels of MRTF / SRF target gene transcripts ( Fig . 5E ) . The free levels of ISG15 protein were highest in MDA - MB - 231 , lowest in MDA - MB - 468 and intermediate in MCF7 cells ( Fig . 5F ) . Interestingly , the ISGylation of target proteins was highest in MDA - MB - 231 , intermediate in MDA - MB - 468 and lowest in MCF - 7 cells ( Fig . S4A ) indicating that MDA - MB - 468 use their entire low ISG15 pool to ISGylate proteins . The invasive properties of MDA - MB - 231 cells were shown to depend on the expression of MRTF - A ( Hu et al . , 2011 ; Medjkane et al . , 2009 ) . To test whether ISG15 is required for SRF / MRTF - A - induced cell invasion , we depleted ISG15 or overexpressed the de - ISGylase UBP43 in MCF - 7 , MDA - MB - 468 and MDA - MB - 231 cells and performed transwell migration assays through FN - coated membranes and 3D - Matrigel invasion assays . MCF - 7 cells were unable to invade through FN - coated membranes and invade 3D - Matrigels ( not shown ) . MDA - MB - 231 and - 468 cells , however , efficiently migrated through FN - coated membranes , which significantly diminished upon shRNA - mediated depletion of ISG15 or overexpression of the de - ISGylase UBP43 ( Fig . 5G , S4B ) . Furthermore , MDA - MB - 231 and to a lesser extent MDA - MB - 468 cells invaded 3D - Matrigels , which was further enhanced upon overexpression of ISG15 ( Fig . 5H , S4C ) . Interestingly , overexpression of ISG15 significantly increased the basal MRTF / SRF activities in MCF - 7 , MDA - MB - 468 and MDA - MB - 231 cells ( Fig . 5I ) pointing to a positive feed - forward loop between integrin - mediated adhesion signalling , MRTF / SRF and ISG15 . In line with a potential feed - forward loop , the decreased migration of MRTF - A - depleted MDA - MB - 231 cells through FN - coated membranes could not be improved by simultaneously overexpressing ISG15 ( Fig . S4D ) . J o u r n a l o f C e ll S c i e n c e • A d v a n c e a r t i c l e Our results suggest that high levels of β 1 - integrin and ISG15 represent prognostic markers for breast cancer patients . To evaluate this possibility , we consulted microarray databases of breast cancer samples and correlated αV integrin , β 1 integrin and ISG15 transcript levels with patient survival . The analyses clearly revealed that patients with high expression of β 1 integrin or ISG15 displayed a significant increase in the hazardous ratio ( HR ) compared to patients with low levels of either transcript ( Fig . 6A , B ) . Importantly , however , patients with high levels of αV , β 1 integrin and ISG15 transcripts in their tumor samples showed a pronounced reduction in disease free survival rate compared to patients with low ISG15 levels ( Fig . 6C ) . These findings demonstrate that integrin - mediated MRTF - A / SRF / ISG15 signaling is elevated in breast cancer and associated with a poor prognosis . J o u r n a l o f C e ll S c i e n c e • A d v a n c e a r t i c l e DISCUSSION Metastasis is initiated with the detachment of an individual cancer cells from the tumour cell aggregate followed by invasion into the surrounding tissue , entry into the circulation and finally settlement in a distant organ . The process of tumour cell invasion is critically dependent on the selection of tumour cells that are able to survive without tumour stroma , on the release of proteases that degrade and remodel the tumour - and tissue - derived ECM , and on cell adhesion molecules such as integrins ( Hood and Cheresh , 2002 ) . Integrins constitute the core components of the invasive machinery of cancer cells . They regulate the activity of small GTPases , actin binding , bundling and modifying proteins to enable cytoskeletal dynamics , membrane protrusions and invadopodia formation ( Bishop and Hall , 2000 ; Hall , 2012 ; Hoshino et al . , 2013 ; Murphy and Courtneidge , 2011 ) . Interestingly , a recent paper showed that inetgrins also regulate the nuclear translocation of MRTF - A and induce MRTF - A / SRF target gene expression ( Plessner et al . , 2015 ) . Since tumour cells express different types of integrins , it is unclear whether and how they co - operate to achieve maximal efficiency in tissue invasion and migration . The aim of the present study was to define integrin subfamilies and the signaling pathways involved in tumour cell invasion . We have recently engineered a fibroblast - like cell line that allows expressing the FN - binding integrin αVβ3 and / or α5β1 . These cell lines were used to demonstrate that αVβ3 and α5β1 integrins control actomyosin - based cell contractility in a cooperative manner ( Schiller et al . , 2013 ) . In the present study we also observed that the cells expressing αVβ3 and α5β1 integrins ( pKO - αV , β1 cells ) most markedly decrease their G - actin pool , which results in the nuclear translocation of the G - actin binding transcriptional transactivator MRTF - A . The nuclear accumulation of MRTF - A allows binding to the transcription factor SRF and transcriptional activation of MRTF - A / SRF target genes , which comprise known target genes such as Actin , Vinculin and Filamins ( Esnault et al . , 2014 ) , as well as novel targets such as Talin - 1 and ISG15 , which contain functional CArG boxes known to bind MRTF - A / SRF complex ( Olson and Nordheim , 2010 ) . Our findings show that ISG15 is particularly highly elevated when αVβ3 and α5β1 are co - expressed and bind FN . ISG15 is a ubiquitin like modifier protein that is conjugated to specific lysine residues of target proteins ( Kerscher et al . , 2006 ) . ISG15 expression , which is elevated in almost all tumours investigated so far ( www . oncomine . org ) , is thought to be induced by type I interferons ( Farrell et al . , 1979 ; Haas et al . , 1987 ) . Since the tumour stroma is infiltrated by immune cells , it is believed that they are the source of interferon α / β production and hence the trigger for the high ISG15 expression in cancer cells ( van der Veen and Ploegh , 2012 ) . While immune cell - derived interferon α / β strongly promotes expression of ISG15 in tumours , it remained unknown why high ISG15 levels persisted in tumour cells isolated and cultured ex J o u r n a l o f C e ll S c i e n c e • A d v a n c e a r t i c l e vivo in the absence of immune cells and interferon α / β ( Han et al . , 2002 ; Hermeking et al . , 1997 ; Lock et al . , 2002 ) . Based on our findings we propose that synergistic αVβ3 / α5β1 - induced nuclear translocation of MRTF - A and activation of SRF are responsible for the high ISG15 transcription ex vivo . ISG15 is conjugated to proteins ( ISGylation ) in a multistep process that requires E1 , E2 and E3 enzymes that is comparable to the protein - ubiquitination pathway ( Haas et al . , 1987 ; Lenschow et al . , 2005 ; Loeb and Haas , 1992 ; Morales and Lenschow , 2013 ; Okumura et al . , 2008 ; Yuan and Krug , 2001 ) . Protein modifications with ISG15 are reversible and can be removed ( or de - ISGylated ) by the ISG15 de - conjugating peptidase , called Ubp43 ( Malakhov et al . , 2002 ) . Protein ISGylation can alter protein function ; for example , ISGylation of Filamin - B can release Filamin - B - bound Rac1 , MKK4 and MEKK1 leading to the termination of JNK signaling and inhibition of apoptosis ( Jeon et al . , 2009 ) . On the other hand , it has also been shown that ISG15 modification can stabilize proteins by inhibiting ubiquitin - specific E2 enzymes ( Desai et al . , 2006 ; Malakhova and Zhang , 2008 ; Okumura et al . , 2008 ) or by competing with ubiquitin for lysine residues on common target proteins ( Liu et al . , 2003 ) . Finally , ISGylation was shown to inhibit protein translation by either increasing the cap structure - binding activity of the ISGylated translational suppressor 4EHP ( Okumura et al . , 2007 ) or by down - regulating elF2α through ISGylation of dsRNA - dependent protein kinase ( PKR ) ( Okumura et al . , 2013 ) . The high expression of ISG15 in tumour cells in vivo and ex vivo indicates that ISGylation - dependent inhibition of apoptosis or stabilization of certain oncogenic proteins represents a tumour promoting function in primary tumors where interferon α / β levels are high as well as during metastasis when interferon levels decrease . Hence , it is conceivable that during invasion and metastasis for example , cooperative signaling via αVβ3 / α5β1 integrins compensates for low interferon levels to sustain high ISG15 expression . Previously published mass - spectrometry analyses of ISG15 - modified proteins ( ISGylome ) in tumor cells revealed that Actin , Actin regulatory and FA proteins ( Filamin - B , Vinculin , Talin - 1 ) can be ISGylated ( Durfee et al . , 2010 ) . It is therefore , possible that αVβ3 / α5β1 integrin - mediated signaling has two major consequences for tumor cell invasion ; αVβ3 / α5β1 integrins activate GTPases leading to polymerization of F - actin networks and stress fibers , which are essential for membrane protrusions , cell contractility and adhesion reinforcement . In addition , the consumption of G - actin for the formation of different F - actin networks results in liberation and nuclear translocation of MRTF - A , binding to SRF and transcription of cytoskeletal , FA proteins and ISG15 itself . ISG15 modifies various proteins , including FA proteins and Actin - binding or - modifying proteins to increase their stability and / or improve their function ( Fig . 7 ) . Such a feed forward circuit operates in mouse fibroblasts as well as in invading MDA - MB - 231 J o u r n a l o f C e ll S c i e n c e • A d v a n c e a r t i c l e breast cancer cells . The metastatic breast cancer cell line MDA - MB - 231 expressed significantly more α5β1 - integrin , contained higher levels of nuclear MRTF - A and ISG15 - conjugated proteins , and performed better in FN - based transwell migration assays and in 3D - Matrigel invasion assays than the less invasive MDA - MB - 468 or non - metastatic MCF7 cells . We could also demonstrate that the ability of the invasive MDA - MB - 231 and MDA - MB - 468 cells to migrate relies on ISG15 expression and ISGylation and that ISG15 overexpression enhances 3D - Matrigel invasion of both , MDA - MB - 231 and MDA - MB - 468 cancer cells . Most importantly , transcriptome analyses of breast cancer samples from large cohorts of patients revealed a statistically highly significant association between disease free patient survival and high β1 integrin ,  V - integrin and ISG15 transcript levels . These findings suggest that breast cancer cells with high integrin levels are selected in a primary tumor mass , which renders them independent of decreasing interferon and growth factor signals for sustaining nuclear MRTF - A activity , ISG15 expression and metastatic potential . J o u r n a l o f C e ll S c i e n c e • A d v a n c e a r t i c l e MATERIAL AND METHODS Cell lines The generation of pKO - αV , pKO - β1 and pKO - αV , β1 cell lines was reported previously ( Schiller et al . , 2013 ) . The breast cancer cell lines MDA - MB - 231 and MCF - 7 were purchased from ATCC ( http : / / www . lgcstandardsatcc . org / Products / CellsandMicroorganisms / Cell _ Lines . aspx ? geo country = de ) , MDA - MB - 468 cells were obtained from Dr . Axel Ullrich ( MPI Biochemistry , Martinsried ) . Immunostainings and surface coating For immunofluorescence microscopy , cells were seeded on ECM - coated micropatterns or glass surfaces ( Coating : 5 µg / ml Fibronectin ( Calbiochem ) or 1 % Gelatin ( Sigma ) or 10 µg / ml Vitronectin ( STEMCELL technologies ) in PBS ) in DMEM ( GIBCO by Life Technologies ) containing 10 % FCS at 37 °C , 5 % CO 2 . To culture cells on micropatterns the culture medium contained 0 . 5 % FCS . After indicated time points the medium was soaked off , and cells were fixed with 3 % PFA in PBS for 10 min at room temperature , washed with PBS , blocked with 1 % BSA in PBS for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with antibodies in a solution of 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 , 3 % BSA in PBS . The fluorescent images were collected with a laser scanning confocal microscope ( Leica SP5 ) . For visualization of G - and F - actin structures , we followed a previously published protocol ( Small et al . , 1999 ) . Antibodies All antibodies are listed in Supplementary Information Table S2 . Crosslinking Enrichment for focal - adhesion - associated proteins was achieved by shortly fixing the ventral cell cortex using DSP crosslinker ( DTSP ; Dithiobis [ succinimidyl propionate ] ) , followed by removal of non - crosslinked proteins and big organelles by stringent cell lysis and hydrodynamic sheer flow washing . Cell fractionation For cell fractionation the ProteoExtract® Cytoskeleton Enrichment and Isolation Kit ( Millipore ) and for G - Actin / F - actin analyses the In Vivo Assay Biochem Kit ( Cytoskeleton , Inc ) were used . For the centrifugation - based method to isolate the nuclei , cells were washed with PBS and harvested in a buffer containing 250 mM sucrose , 10 mM HEPES and 1 . 5 mM EDTA . With the help of a syringe and a 26Ga needle ( Terumo ) cells were disrupted further . After centrifugation the pellet ( nuclei fraction ) was washed 5 times with a buffer containing 20 mM Tris , 0 . 1 mM EDTA and 2 mM MgCl 2 . The pellet was re - suspended in FACS buffer or staining solution for immunostaining . J o u r n a l o f C e ll S c i e n c e • A d v a n c e a r t i c l e G - actin pulldown by DNaseI DNaseI ( Sigma - Aldrich ) was covalently linked to CNBr - activated Sepharose beads ( Sigma - Aldrich ) at a concentration of 1 mg / ml according to the manufacturer´s protocol . BSA - Sepharose beads , which served as control , were prepared in the same way . For G - actin pulldown , nuclear and cytosolic fractions were incubated with 35µl of DNaseI - or BSA - coupled Sepharose beads in a volume of 200 µl over night at 4°C in an end - over - end - mixer . Next day , the beads were washed five times with cold wash buffer ( 1 % NP - 40 , 0 . 1 % SDS , 1 mM DTT , 1 mM PMSF in PBS ) . Beads were dried with a syringe and needle and SDS - sample buffer was added for subsequent western blot analysis . Constructs and transfections Constitutive active MRTF - A ( ∆NMRTF - A ) , dominant negative MRTF - A ( DN MRTF - A : ∆N1B1 and ∆N∆C ) and MRTF - A / SRF reporter constructs have been previously characterized ( Leitner et al . , 2011 ) . Constitutive active myc - mDia1 expression construct ( myc - mDia1 FH1FH2 ) was amplified from an existing plasmid with forward primer 5’ - gccaagaatgaaatggcttc - 3’ and reverse 5’ - tgcagagcttctagaagact , then the PCR product was cloned into the pCRII - TOPO vector and sequenced . The integrin αV - mCherry and integrin β1 - mCherry were provided by Ralph Böttcher . The knockdown constructs for stable knockdown of human ISG15 were purchased from Sigma and the UBP43 overexpression construct was obtained from Addgene . All transfections were carried out with Lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitrogen through Life Technologies ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Immunoblot detection of conjugated ISG15 Cells were incubated for 20 min with 50 µM of N - Ethylmaleimide ( NEM ) and lysed on ice in RIPA buffer supplemented with 25 mM NEM and protease and phosphatase inhibitors . Protein concentration was measured by Bradford assay , samples were boiled for 5 min in Laemmli buffer containing 2 % 2 - Mercaptoethanol . MRTF - A / SRF luciferase reporter assay Cells were plated on FN coated 12 - well plates ( 6 . 0 x 10 5 cells per well ) before transient transfection with 0 . 5 µg of MRTF - A / SRF reporter ( p3DA . luc ) ( Sotiropoulos et al . , 1999 ) , indicated expression plasmid and 25 ng thymidine kinase - driven renilla luciferase ( Promega ) for normalization of transfection efficiency . The total amount of transfected plasmid DNA was kept constant at 1 . 5 µg per well by using pEGFP - C1 expression vector ( Clontech ) . After 24h luciferase activity was analyzed with a Dual Luciferase reporter assay kit ( Promega ) using GloMax® Microplate Luminometer ( Promega ) . Jasplakinolide ( 100 nM , # 420107 - J o u r n a l o f C e ll S c i e n c e • A d v a n c e a r t i c l e 50UG from Merck Millipore ) and Latrunculin A ( 500 nM , L5163 from Sigma ) treatment was initiated 3h prior to cell lysis . Micropatterning Micropatterns were generated on PEG - coated glass coverslips with deep - ultraviolet lithography ( Azioune et al . , 2010 ) . Glass coverslips were incubated in a 1 mM solution of a linear PEG , CH3 – ( O – CH2 – CH2 ) 43 – NH – CO – NH – CH2 – CH2 – CH2 – Si ( OEt ) 3 in dry toluene for 20 h at 80 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere . The substrates were removed , rinsed intensively with ethyl acetate , methanol and water , and dried with nitrogen . A pegylated glass coverslip and a chromium - coated quartz photomask ( ML & C , Jena ) were immobilized with vacuum onto a mask holder , which was immediately exposed to deep ultraviolet light using a low - pressure mercury lamp ( NIQ 60 / 35 XL longlife lamp , quartz tube , 60 W from Heraeus Noblelight ) at 5 cm distance for 7 min . The patterned substrates were subsequently incubated overnight with 100 μl of fibronectin ( 20 μg ml−1 in PBS ) at 4 °C and washed once with PBS . FACS analysis For FACS analysis suspension of fibroblasts was incubated for 1 h with primary antibodies on ice and then washed twice with FACS - PBS ( 3 mM EDTA , 2 % FCS in PBS ) . Cell viability was assessed by propidium iodide staining . FACS analysis was carried out using a FACSCalibur Cytometer ( BD Biosciences ) and cell sorting with an AriaFACSII high - speed sorter ( BD Biosciences ) , both equipped with FACS DiVa software ( BD Biosciences ) . Purity of sorted cells was determined by post sort FACS analysis and typically exceeded 95 % . Data analysis was conducted using the FlowJo program ( Version 9 . 4 . 10 ) . Quantitative real - time PCR Total RNA from cells was extracted with RNeasy Mini extraction kit ( Qiagen ) following manufacturer’s instructions . cDNA was prepared with an iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit ( Biorad ) . Real - time PCR was performed with an iCycler ( Biorad ) . Each sample was measured in triplicates and the values were normalized to gapdh levels . PCR primers are listed in Supplementary Information Table S1 . Interferon ELISA Cells were plated on FN - coated tissue culture dishes for three days and the cells ` supernatant was analyzed . To induce interferon production cells were transfected with 100 µg / ml Poly ( I : C ) . ELISA for interferon α and interferon β secretion was performed with the VeriKine TM Mouse IFN - α and Mouse IFN - β ELISA kit ( PBL Interferon Source , product # 42120 and # 42400 ) according to manufacturer´s instructions . J o u r n a l o f C e ll S c i e n c e • A d v a n c e a r t i c l e Transwell migration assay Invasion assay ( Merck Millipore’s QCM™ Boyden chamber , 8 µm pore size ) was performed according to manufacturer´s instructions . MCF - 7 , MDA - MB - 468 and MDA - MB - 231 cells were seeded into polycarbonate transwells at a density of 3x10 4 cells and in a volume of 300  l medium . Migration occurred for 12 hours from serum - free medium towards medium with 10 % FCS . After removing the non - migrating cells and staining the transmigrated cells with Phalloidin - TRITC and DAPI , micrographs were taken at 200x magnification . For each condition , cell migration was deduced by counting DAPI + cell nuclei within 10 random regions on the transwell membrane . Chromatin immunoprecipitations ( ChIP ) For all ChIP experiments , pKO - αV , β1 cells were used . Cross - linking , nuclei preparation and nuclease digestion of chromatin was performed according to manufacturer ` s instructions ( SimpleCHIP Enzymatic Chromatin IP Kit ( Magnetic Beads , # 9003 , Cell Signaling Technology ) . Then , 500 µl of chromatin was incubated overnight at 4°C with 10 µl anti - SRF antibodies ( # 5147 ; Cell Signaling Technology ) or 30 µl home - made anti - MRTF - A rabbit serum ( # 79 ) . After washing the immunoprecipitated chromatin , the DNA – protein complexes were eluted with the ChIP elution buffer . Crosslinks were reversed overnight at 65°C , and DNA was purified via columns provided in the kit . Quantification was done by quantitative real - time PCR and is shown as the percentage of input chromatin . Gene - specific primers for amplification of immunoprecipitated DNA are listed in supplementary material Table SI . Primers for gapdh and srf loci were published previously ( Vartiainen et al . , 2007 ) . RNA interference Cells were infected with retroviral 29mer shISG15 expression constructs purchased from Sigma ( # TG502956 ) . The puromycine selection was used to select for cells carrying integrations . Kaplan Meier analysis of gene expression microarray To analyze the prognostic value of integrin αV , integrin β 1 and ISG15 mRNA expression levels the Kaplan - Meier plotter was used ( http : / / kmplot . com / analysis / ; ( Gyorffy et al . , 2010 ) . The patient samples were split into two groups according to various quantile expressions of the proposed biomarker ( low and high expression ) . The two patient cohorts were compared by a Kaplan - Meier survival plot , and the hazard ratio with 95 % confidence intervals and logrank P value were calculated . Statistics Data are expressed as the mean±s . e . m . of at least three independent experiments . Unless otherwise indicated , statistical significance was determined using unpaired two - tailed Student t test .
