R100005200 Allen P . Minton‡ From the Section on Physical Biochemistry , Laboratory of Biochemistry and Genetics , NIDDK , National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , Maryland 20892 Detailed knowledge of the rates , equilibria , and mechanism of biochemical reactions has traditionally been acquired through experiments conducted on solutions containing low concentrations ( less than about 1 mg / ml ) of total protein , nu - cleic acid , and / or polysaccharide together with buffer salts , low molecular weight substrates , and cofactors as required . In con - trast , biochemical reactions in living systems take place in media containing substantially greater total concentrations ( 50 – 400 mg / ml ) of macromolecules that may be present in solution and / or in indefinitely large arrays ( e . g . cytoskeletal fibers ) ( 1 , 2 ) . Because no single macromolecular species may be present at high concentration , but all species taken together occupy a significant fraction of the volume of the medium , such media are referred to as “crowded” ( 3 ) and / or “confining” ( 4 ) rather than “concentrated , ” depending upon whether the mac - rosolutes are soluble and / or structured . Fig . 1 provides a sche - matic illustration of crowding and confinement in eukaryotic cytoplasm . In such media , nonspecific interactions between macrosolutes contribute significantly to the total free energy of the medium . High concentrations of “background” macromole - cules that do not participate directly in a particular test reac - tion have been observed to induce order - of - magnitude or greater changes in the rates and equilibria of numerous test reactions ( see below ) . To properly assess the physiological role of a particular reaction or set of reactions characterized in vitro , it is important to consider the possible influence of crowd - ing and / or confinement upon the reaction in its physiological milieu . Nonspecific Interaction A nonspecific interaction between a pair of macromolecules does not depend strongly upon details of the primary , second - ary , or tertiary structure ( s ) of the interacting macromolecules but rather upon global properties such as net charge , dipole or multipole moment , the polarity of surface residues , and mac - romolecular “shape . ” Nonspecific interactions may be either repulsive ( steric , electrostatic ) or attractive ( electrostatic , hy - drophobic ) and are generally substantially weaker on a pair - wise basis than specific interactions between reaction partners . The concept of “nonspecific interaction” is widely misunder - stood . Many if not most biomedical researchers still regard such interaction as an artifact of a particular experimental system that interferes with the acquisition of meaningful data . Strategies such as extrapolation of results to zero macromolec - ular concentration are devised for the reduction or elimination of the influence of nonspecific interaction on a test reaction . Although such procedures may be appropriate in certain spe - cific experimental situations , they do not necessarily provide results that are more meaningful in a biological context . On the contrary , significant nonspecific interaction is an unavoidable consequence of crowding and confinement in most or all phys - iological fluid media . To understand molecular processes in such media one must therefore take account of nonspecific interactions rather than attempt to eliminate them . Effect of Nonspecific Solute - Solute Interaction upon Chemical Equilibria The contribution of a particular solute species X to the total free energy of the system is a function of an effective concen - tration , called the thermodynamic activity of X , denoted by a x . Thermodynamics teaches that equilibrium constants are gen - erally expressed in terms of equilibrium activities rather than actual concentrations . As a simple example , consider a protein molecule that may reversibly self - associate to form a dimer . The equilibrium association constant for this reaction is K 12 o 5 ( a 2 / a 12 ) , where subscripts 1 and 2 refer to monomer and dimer , respectively . Biochemists are accustomed to seeing equilibrium constants written as ratios of equilibrium concentrations . However , the so - called equilibrium constant written in terms of concentrations , K 12 , is actually an apparent constant re - lated to the true equilibrium constant , K 12 o , by K 12 [ ( c 2 / c 12 ) 5 K 12 o ( g 12 / g 2 ) , where g i denotes the ratio of effective to actual concentrations of species i , termed the activity coefficient . The activity coefficient has a precise definition in terms of nonspe - cific solute - solute interaction , ln g i 5 , g i . / kT , where , g i . denotes the ( composition - dependent ) equilibrium average free energy of nonspecific interaction between a molecule of species i and all of the other macrosolutes present in the medium , k is the Boltzmann constant , and T is the absolute temperature . Excluded and Available Volume Steric repulsion is the most fundamental of all interactions between macromolecules in solution and is always present at finite concentration , independent of the magnitude of addi - tional electrostatic or hydrophobic interactions . Because solute molecules are mutually impenetrable , the presence of a signif - icant volume fraction of macromolecules in the medium places constraints on the placement of an additional molecule of test macrosolute that depend upon the relative sizes , shapes , and concentrations of all macrosolutes in the medium . Fig . 2 depicts a region , demarcated by a square outline , in a solution contain - ing spherical “background” macrosolutes of radius r b , colored black , that occupy ; 30 % of the total volume ( v tot ) of the spec - ified region . The available volume ( v a , T ) is defined to be that part of the volume of the region which may be occupied by the center of mass of a molecule of a spherical test species T of radius r t added to the solution . If the test species is very small relative to the background species ( Fig . 2 A ) , then the available volume , indicated in blue , is approximately equal to that part of the total volume not occupied by the background species , i . e . ; 0 . 7 v tot . However , if the size of the test species is comparable * This minireview will be reprinted in the 2001 Minireview Compen - dium , which will be available in December , 2001 . ‡ To whom correspondence should be addressed : Bldg . 8 , Rm . 226 , NIH , Bethesda , MD 20892 - 0830 .

Then the volume available to the test species , indicated by the blue - colored regions in Fig . 2 B , is that part of the total volume which is not occupied by any background molecule or by any shell . It is evident upon inspection of Fig . 2 , A and B , that the available volume is a sensitive function of the relative sizes ( and shapes ) of test and background molecules and the number density of background molecules . 2 Volume may be excluded to a test particle by the surfaces of immobile structures as well as by individual background mac - rosolutes ( 4 , 5 ) , as illustrated in Fig . 3 , which depicts a pore with square cross - section . 3 The center of a spherical test mol - ecule whose diameter is comparable with the largest dimension of the pore ( Fig . 3 B ) is excluded from the pink - colored region , which in this instance represents a significant fraction of the total volume of the solution enclosed in the pore . Available Volume , Free Energy , and Chemical Reactivity In a solution of macromolecules interacting exclusively via steric repulsion there exists an extremely simple relationship between the effective and actual concentration of each solute species ( 6 ) , g i [ ( a i / c i ) 5 ( n tot / n a , i ) , where n tot and n a , i denote the total volume and volume available to species i , respectively . The thermodynamic activities of macromolecules in fluid media may be measured by several physical - chemical methods . In Fig . 4 , the experimentally measured ratio of the effective to actual concentration of hemoglobin , under experimental condi - tions comparable with those encountered in a red blood cell , is plotted as a function of the actual concentration . The first remarkable feature of this dependence is its highly non - linear nature ; the effective concentration of hemoglobin exceeds the actual concentration by a factor of . 10 at 200 g / liter and a factor approaching 100 at 300 g / liter . ( For reference , the con - centration of hemoglobin within a normal red blood cell typi - cally exceeds 300 g / liter . ) The second remarkable feature is that the experimentally measured dependence may be ac - counted for quantitatively over the entire concentration range by a simple geometrical model for available volume , in which each hemoglobin molecule is represented by a rigid spherical particle of radius ; 29 . 5 Å , i . e . a particle closely resembling a “shrink - wrapped” hemoglobin molecule ( 7 , 8 ) . The ratio of effective to actual concentration ( i . e . activity coefficient ) of a protein within a polymer gel may be calculated from the extent to which the protein partitions between the gel and bulk solution ( 4 , 5 ) . In Fig . 5 , this ratio , measured exper - imentally in a dextran gel occupying about 3 % of total solution volume , is plotted for a variety of globular proteins as a func - tion of molar mass . We note that the dependence of activity coefficient upon molar mass is reasonably independent of the identity of the protein , indicating that it is a property primarily of protein size and is insensitive to small changes in shape or composition . The solid curve was calculated using a simple geometrical model for available volume ( 9 ) , in which each pro - tein is modeled as a hard spherical particle with a radius proportional to the cube root of mass , and polymer is modeled as a random matrix of hard cylindrical rods . Estimated Magnitude of Crowding Effects on Association Equilibria We present a simple example of how the difference between activity and concentration in a crowded medium may qualita - 1 For markedly non - spherical molecules , r C is a function of the mu - tual orientations of test and background molecules . For approximately spherical molecules , r C may be treated as a constant equal to the sum of the average radii of test and background molecules . 2 Although Fig . 2 , A and B , reflects a static distribution of background molecules , these conclusions hold also for a dynamic distribution , as - suming equivalence of spatial and time averages . 3 This pore is one possible idealized representation of a small element of volume bounded by large macromolecular assemblies , such as inter - stices within a lattice of rodlike fibers or lamellar space between adja - cent membrane surfaces .

For the sake of illustration , we set the molar mass of A equal to 100 , 000 and assume that both A and A 2 have roughly spherical shape . 5 Using the same geometrical model for excluded volume and the same size and shape parameters used to fit the data in Fig . 5 ( 9 ) , the values of g 1 and g 2 may be estimated to be about 3 3 10 2 and 1 3 10 4 , respectively , for a fractional volume occupancy f of 0 . 2 , and about 1 3 10 4 and 1 3 10 6 , respectively , for f 5 0 . 3 . It follows from the second equation that the experimentally observed equilibrium constant , K 12 , would be expected to ex - ceed K 12 o ( the value of K 12 in the limit of high dilution ) by a factor of ; 10 in a medium of f 5 0 . 2 and ; 100 in a medium of f 5 0 . 3 . Although this estimate is only qualitative , the large magnitude of the predicted effect of excluded volume tran - scends the crudeness of the theoretical model . Indeed , similar but somewhat more refined predictions have been confirmed , in some cases quantitatively , by experimental observation ( see references in Ref . 11 and in Table I ) . Effect of Excluded Volume on Macromolecular Association Reaction Rates There are two opposing effects of excluded volume on reac - tion rates ( 12 ) . If the overall rate of the reaction is limited by the rate with which a transition state complex decays to prod - ucts , then crowding would be expected to enhance the relative abundance of the transition state complex and hence the for - ward reaction rate . Under these conditions , the forward rate constant may be increased by up to the equilibrium enhance - ment factor , depending upon details of the particular reaction . However , if the overall rate of the reaction is limited by the rate with which reactant molecules encounter each other through diffusional motion , then crowding , which retards diffusional motion ( 13 , 14 ) , would be expected to lower the forward reac - tion rate . In the limit of high fractional volume occupancy , all association reactions are expected to be diffusion limited and hence slowed by crowding ( 11 ) . Hence , depending upon the nature of a particular reaction , one of two types of behavior may be observed as the fractional volume occupancy of back - ground molecules increases : the forward rate for a macromo - lecular association may decrease monotonically or may initially increase , pass through a maximum , and then decrease . A bi - modal dependence of reaction rate on crowder concentration has been observed experimentally ( 15 ) . Macromolecular Reactions Affected by Excluded Volume Macromolecular crowding and / or confinement by back - ground molecules or structures can in principle affect the equi - librium and kinetics of any macromolecular reaction in which there exists a significant difference between the volume ex - cluded to reactants and the volume excluded to products . Such reactions include self - or heteroassociation , condensation ( crys - tallization , nucleation - controlled fiber formation ) , binding of macromolecules to specific surface sites , nonspecific surface adsorption , and protein isomerization , including folding / un - folding ( 4 , 10 , 11 , 16 – 18 ) . Crowding may also affect enzyme - catalyzed reactions of small molecules if the mechanism of catalysis involves significant conformational change of the en - zyme ( 3 , 10 ) . Many such effects have indeed been observed experimentally . Most of the older observations are cited in Ref . 11 , and some more recent observations are listed in Table I . Broader Physiological Ramifications In recent years increased attention has been paid to the functioning of ever larger macromolecular assemblies and sys - tems of interacting components , sometimes referred to as mo - lecular machines ( 19 ) . As larger and more complex systems have come under closer scrutiny , a growing number of biomed - ical researchers have emphasized the extremely broad ramifi - cations of macromolecular crowding and confinement for bio - chemistry in the intact cell ( see for example Refs . 20 – 25 ) . It is becoming more widely appreciated that under physiological conditions of crowding or confinement , the size - and shape - de - pendent reduction of volume available to every species of mac - romolecule results in major shifts in the rates and equilibria of a broad range of macromolecular reactions relative to those measured in dilute solution . We now recognize that nonspecific interactions , including ( but not limited to ) steric repulsion , provide a substantial contribution to the free energy balance of a physiological system such as an intact cell or tissue . It seems likely that the constituent elements of these sys - tems have evolved to function optimally under normal physio - logical ( i . e . crowded and / or confined ) conditions and that the proper functioning of the system depends upon maintenance of the free energy balance established under those crowded and / or confined conditions . Excluded volume theory predicts that at the high level of macromolecular fractional volume occupancy characteristic of all living cells ( i . e . . 0 . 20 – 0 . 30 ) , the reactivity of almost every soluble macromolecular species , di - lute as well as concentrated , will depend sensitively upon its 4 A more complete treatment is presented in Ref . 10 . 5 Although the dimer is unlikely to be spherical , its deviation from sphericity will not be so large that treatment as an approximate sphere will introduce a qualitative error into the present estimate ( 10 ) .

It follows that rela - tively small changes in the fractional volume occupancy of the cellular interior are expected to have major effects on the equilibria and kinetics of a broad variety of intracellular reac - tions ( 26 , 27 ) . These considerations help us to understand two very general properties of living cells . 1 ) Relatively modest changes of cellular volume in animal cells ( i . e . concentration of intracellular macromolecules ) are associated with changes in the rates of a broad spectrum of diverse intracellular processes that are much too large to be accounted for on the basis of simple mass action ( 28 ) . 2 ) Every type of cell so far examined , from bacterial to human , is equipped with one or more mech - anisms ( varying widely among different types of cells ) for the maintenance or restoration of cellular volume , water content , and / or turgor pressure in response to changes in composition of the extracellular fluid ( 29 ) . The examples presented here are only a few of many sup - porting the hypothesis that macromolecular crowding and con - finement play important and perhaps essential roles in cell biology and physiology ( 11 , 24 , 30 – 34 ) . Effects of excluded volume in physiological media are of sufficient magnitude to mandate careful consideration when postulating a role in vivo for any macromolecular reaction characterized in vitro .
