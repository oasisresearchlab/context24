Within the endocytic network , clathrin functions as a central organizing platform for coated pit assembly and dissociation via its terminal domain ( TD ) . We report the design and synthesis of two compounds named pitstops that selectively block endocytic ligand asso - ciation with the clathrin TD as conﬁrmed by X - ray crystallography . Pitstop - induced inhibition of cla - thrin TD function acutely interferes with receptor - mediated endocytosis , entry of HIV , and synaptic vesicle recycling . Endocytosis inhibition is caused by a dramatic increase in the lifetimes of clathrin coat components , including FCHo , clathrin , and dy - namin , suggesting that the clathrin TD regulates coated pit dynamics . Pitstops provide new tools to address clathrin function in cell physiology with potential applications as inhibitors of virus and path - ogen entry and as modulators of cell signaling . INTRODUCTION Clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) regulates the cell surface levels and endocytic uptake of important plasma membrane proteins ( Brodsky et al . , 2001 ; Conner and Schmid , 2003 ) . These include nutrient and growth factor receptors , ion channels , adhe - sion proteins , and synaptic vesicle ( SV ) proteins in the brain . The clathrin - based endocytic machinery is also hijacked by patho - gens such as bacteria and viruses to get access to the cell inte - rior ( Conner and Schmid , 2003 ; Miyauchi et al . , 2009 ; Veiga et al . , 2007 ) . Assembly of clathrin - coated pits ( CCPs ) likely is initiated by the recruitment of early - acting endocytic proteins such as FCHo 1 / 2 , intersectins , and Eps15 / Eps15R ( Henne et al . , 2010 ; Pechstein et al . , 2010 ) . These factors serve as scaffolds for the coassembly of AP - 2 , which coordinates recognition of trans - membrane cargo ( Edeling et al . , 2006 ) with recruitment of acces - sory proteins . Early endocytic structures are stabilized by an assembling clathrin coat built from soluble clathrin triskelia comprising three heavy and three light chains ( Brodsky et al . , 2001 ; Conner and Schmid , 2003 ; Edeling et al . , 2006 ) . The central building block of triskelia is the 190 kDa clathrin heavy chain , which forms an extended three - legged structure . The N - terminal b - propeller domain ( TD ) at the distal end of the leg adopts a WD40 - like fold ( ter Haar et al . , 2000 ) , while the C terminus is near the vertex of the triskelion ( Brodsky et al . , 2001 ) . The clathrin cage has been postulated to serve at least two major functions in endocytosis : ( 1 ) stabilizing deformed mem - brane domains ( Hinrichsen et al . , 2006 ) and ( 2 ) providing an inter - action hub for the recruitment of accessory factors that regulate progression of endocytosis ( Schmid and McMahon , 2007 ) . Structural and proteomic studies have revealed a surprisingly simple architecture of accessory protein - clathrin interactions ( Schmid and McMahon , 2007 ) . Most of these factors , including amphiphysins , AP180 , and SNX9 , harbor so - called clathrin box motifs ( or variants thereof ) , simple degenerate peptides that bind to a structurally well - deﬁned site on the TD of clathrin heavy chain ( ter Haar et al . , 2000 ) . Consistent with the proposed func - tion of the TD as a central protein - protein interaction hub ( Schmid and McMahon , 2007 ) overexpression of clathrin - binding fragments of endocytic proteins causes the sequestra - tion of clathrin within the cytoplasm ( Slepnev et al . , 2000 ) , sug - gesting that multiple redundant interactions of accessory proteins with the TD serve to recruit clathrin to membranes . However , overexpression experiments need to be interpreted Cell 146 , 471 – 484 , August 5 , 2011 ª 2011 Elsevier Inc . 471 Figure 1 .

Moreover , dominant - negative and genetic approaches bear the inherent disadvantage that indirect effects caused by sustained expres - sion or loss - of - function cannot be distinguished from direct phenotypes . It is thus essential to identify molecular reagents that can selectively and acutely interfere with CME . No speciﬁc compounds targeting clathrin are available so far . Here , we describe the identiﬁcation and characterization of two small molecule inhibitors of clathrin TD function , named pit - stops for their ability to stall clathrin - coated pit ( CCP ) dynamics , which acutely interfere with receptor - mediated endocytosis , entry of HIV , and SV reformation . Pitstops provide tools to address clathrin function in cell physiology with potential appli - cations as inhibitors of virus and pathogen entry and as modula - tors of cell signaling . RESULTS Pitstops Are Nontoxic Speciﬁc Inhibitors of Endocytic Ligand Association with the Clathrin Terminal Domain Clathrin function in mammalian cells has been addressed mainly via knockdown ( Motley et al . , 2003 ) or dominant - negative approaches ( Dittman and Ryan , 2009 ; Slepnev et al . , 2000 ) . At invertebrate neuromuscular junctions using transgenic ﬂies cla - thrin has also been targeted by photoinactivation ( Heerssen et al . , 2008 ) . While these strategies have shown that clathrin is essential for CCP formation or stability , no information exists regarding the physiological role of endocytic ligand association of its TD . This is a surprising knowledge gap given the fact that clathrin box - TD interactions form a major hub within the endo - cytic network ( Schmid and McMahon , 2007 ) . Based on previous cell biological and biochemical studies , it was suggested that multiple redundant interactions of the clathrin TD with its endo - cytic ligands may serve to stably recruit clathrin to membranes , thereby facilitating clathrin assembly through local enrichment ( Figure 1A , left ) . Alternatively , clathrin assembled at nascent en - docytic sites could serve as an organizing scaffold that regulates CCP dynamics by providing spatially deﬁned binding sites on its TD for accessory proteins that drive CCP maturation and disas - sembly ( Figure 1A , right ) . To distinguish between these models , we used a chemical biology approach designed to identify inhibitors of complex formation between the TD and its endocytic ligands . We carried out an ELISA - based screen for small molecules that can interfere with clathrin TD association of the B / C domain of amphiphysin , an endocytic protein harboring a clathrin box motif ( Slepnev et al . , 2000 ) . Screening a library of about 17 , 000 small molecules from the central open access technology platform of the Chem - BioNet , we identiﬁed and validated ( see Extended Experimental Procedures available online ) two lead compounds that exhibited selective inhibition of clathrin TD - amphiphysin association ( Fig - ure 1B ) . Retrosynthetic analysis identiﬁed simple approaches to in - house synthesis of two focused compound libraries based on the original leads . This led to the identiﬁcation of two mole - cules of distinct chemical scaffolds , which speciﬁcally disrupt ligand association with the clathrin TD . Based on subsequent studies and their ability to impair CCP function ( see below ) we named these compounds pitstops 1 ( from the naphthalimide library ) and 2 ( from the rhodanine library , Figure 1C ) . Pitstops 1 and 2 selectively inhibited amphiphysin association of clathrin TD with IC 50 values of 18 and 12 m M , respectively ( Figure 1D ) . Consistent with a crucial role for the clathrin box within amphi - physin for clathrin TD association a truncation mutant lacking the clathrin box sequence displayed a near complete loss of its clathrin TD binding ability ( Figure 1F ) , similar to that seen in pit - stop - treated samples . Clathrin TD binding of other endocytic proteins such as the C - terminal domains of AP180 and synapto - janin 1 ( p170 ) , or the PH domain of OCRL was also inhibited with IC 50 s between 24 and 40 m M ( Figure 1E ) . By contrast , neither compound affected complex formation between the ear domain of AP - 2 a and amphiphysin ( a top - site ligand ) or stonin 2 ( a side - site ligand ) , or between the AP - 1 g - ear and its accessory binding partner gadkin ( Figure 1G ) . Pitstops also did not inﬂuence the in vitro GTPase activity of full - length native sheep brain dynamin 1 ( data not shown ) . Pitstops did not exhibit generalized cytotox - icity after 8 hr exposure in HeLa cells assayed by LDH activity ( Figure S1A ) or TUNEL staining to detect apoptotic cells ( Fig - ure S1B ) . Prolonged exposure ( 20 hr ) to pitstops did not affect cell membrane integrity ( Figures S1C and S1D ) or induce apo - ptotic cell death ( Figure S1E ) . Even longer exposure ( 72 hr ) did not affect cell viability and proliferation in a variety of cell lines ( Table S1 ) . We conclude that pitstops act as selective inhibitors of clathrin TD function that do not adversely affect cell viability . Pitstop Association with the Clathrin Terminal Domain Obstructs Binding of Clathrin Box Ligands To understand the molecular basis of clathrin TD inhibition by pitstops , we determined the structure of the clathrin TD in com - plex with pitstops by protein X - ray crystallography . Clathrin TD - containing crystals diffracted up to a resolution of 1 . 7 A˚ and the structure was solved by molecular replacement using the cla - thrin TD as a search model ( Table S2 ) . Following reﬁnement , inhibitor molecules in complex with clathrin TD could be identi - ﬁed and modeled into the electron densities ( Figures S2A and S2B ) . The overall structures of clathrin TD in complex with either pitstops 1 or 2 are shown in Figures 2A and 2C . The clathrin TD adopts a WD40 - like structure comprised of a seven bladed b - propeller each with four antiparallel strands ( ter Haar et al . , 2000 ) . Both inhibitors bind the interface between the ﬁrst and second blades ( Figures 2B and 2D ) at a site largely overlapping with that used by clathrin box - containing accessory proteins ( Figures 2E and 2F ) . Pitstop 1 lies in a hydrophobic cavity formed by four isoleu - cines ( 52 , 62 , 80 , 93 ) , Leu82 , and Phe91 . Its conformation is stabilized by ﬁve hydrogen bonds at both ends of pitstop 1 . Only one direct hydrogen bond is formed between the sulfonate ( F ) Bindingofamphiphysin1B / C ( 250 - 578 ) oratruncationlackingtheclathrinbox ( 365 - 578 ) toclathrinTD .

All other hydrogen bonds are mediated by water ( Figure 2B ) . Comparison of ligand - free clathrin TD with the pitstop 1 - bound form shows that two residues in the clathrin box - binding site undergo major conformational changes upon ligand binding . While the phenyl ring of Phe 91 rotates by 60 (cid:1) around the C a - C b bond and stacks against the nonpolar portion of the compound on one side , the guanidinium group of the Arg64 side - chain stacks on pitstop 1 on the opposite side ( Figure S2C ) . Pitstop 2 occupies the identical hydrophobic cavity used by pitstop 1 . However , we also note signiﬁcant differences in the binding modes of both molecules ( Figure 2D ) . The side chain of Arg64 is positioned along the central part of pitstop 2 and forms bidentate hydrogen bonds with O and N atoms of the thia - zol - 4 ( 5 H ) - one ring . The conformational change of Arg 64 allows enough space for the nonpolar portion of pitstop 2 to insert deeply into the hydrophobic cavity , toward the ﬁrst blade . The phenyl ring of Phe 91 stacks against the nonpolar edge of the bromobenzene group of pitstop 2 ( Figure 2D ) . Since the solvent - exposed bromobenzene moiety lies on the second blade of the clathrin TD , the ﬁrst and the second blades are blocked by pitstop 2 . Our analysis reveals that two chemically unrelated pitstops ﬁt into the targeted TD groove in two different poses and induce distinct structural changes in clathrin TD ( Figure S2C ) . This provides a molecular basis for the selective displacement of cla - thrin box ligands from the TD and accounts for the in vitro and in vivo activities of pitstops . Pitstop 2 Selectively Inhibits Clathrin - Mediated Endocytosis and HIV Entry To examine whether pitstop 2 can act in living cells , we analyzed its effect on the internalization of transferrin ( Tf ) and epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) , known ligands for CME ( Conner and Schmid , 2003 ; Goh et al . , 2010 ) . When exposed to Alexa 568 - Tf HeLa cells efﬁciently internalized Tf into perinuclear recycling en - dosomes . Preincubation of HeLa cells with pitstop 2 led to a dose - dependent inhibition of Tf uptake with an IC 50 value ( 12 – 15 m M ) very similar to that measured for blocking clathrin TD function in vitro ( Figures 3A and 3B ) . Application of 30 m M pitstop 2 completely blocked Tf endocytosis , similar to what has been observed in clathrin knockdown cells ( Motley et al . , 2003 ) . Pitstop 2 - induced block of Tf endocytosis in HeLa cells was completely reversed within 1 – 3 hr of drug washout . In another cell line , U2OS , the IC 50 for Tf uptake was 9 . 7 ± 1 . 5 m M ( n = 5 independent experiments , three distinct synthetic batches ) . Treatment with similar concentrations of pitstop 2 also blocked Tf uptake in other cell types including Cos7 and BSC1 cells , astrocytes , or primary neurons ( compare Figure S6 ) . Pit - stop 2 also caused a potent inhibition of EGF uptake ( Figure 3C ) , consistent with the notion that the majority of EGF is endocy - tosed via a clathrin - mediated entry route in most cell types ( Goh et al . , 2010 ) . Pitstop 1 , which displays comparably low cell membrane penetration , exhibited qualitatively similar effects , albeit at much higher doses ( data not shown ) . To better understand the mechanism by which pitstop 2 inhibits receptor - mediated endocytosis , we incubated Cos7 cells with Alexa 488 - EGF at 4 (cid:1) C to accumulate ligand - receptor complexes in CCPs . A similar , albeit slightly enhanced accumu - lation of EGF was observed in pitstop 2 - treated cells ( Figures 3D and 3E ) , suggesting that pitstop 2 does not interfere with cargo recognition or sequestration into CCPs , a step mediated by en - docytic adaptors such as AP - 2 . These data argue against nonspeciﬁc effects of pitstop 2 on plasma membrane organiza - tion and suggests that pitstop 2 blocks CME at a step subse - quent to cargo sequestration . Shiga toxin is known to enter cells via a clathrin - independent glycosphingolipid - dependent route ( Johannes and Ro¨mer , 2010 ) . HeLa cells rapidly internalized Shiga toxin , which accu - mulated in the cis - Golgi area , irrespective of the presence of pitstop 2 ( Figures 3F and 3G ) . We noticed a slight , though statis - tically insigniﬁcant delay , in Shiga toxin delivery to the cis - Golgi in pitstop 2 - treated cells ( Figure 3H ) , indicating that clathrin TD - ligand interactions are not required for retrograde transport of Shiga toxin , although they may facilitate its endosomal sorting ( Saint - Pol et al . , 2004 ) . This supports the speciﬁcity of pitstop 2 for the CME pathway . Many viruses and pathogens exploit the clathrin - dependent endocytic machinery for cell entry . HIV - 1 entry into cells has recently been shown to occur predominantly or exclusively via CME in studies using dominant - negative dynamin or Eps15 ( Daecke et al . , 2005 ) , or the small molecule dynamin inhibitor dynasore ( Miyauchi et al . , 2009 ) . This suggests an obligatory role for clathrin in HIV - 1 entry . To address this , we infected HeLa reporter cell lines for 2 hr with HIV - 1 in the presence or absence of pitstop 2 . Subsequent fusion events were blocked with an HIV entry inhibitor and infection was scored by luciferase readout . Pitstop 2 potently and speciﬁcally reduced HIV - 1 infec - tivity by > 90 % ( Figure 3I and Figure S3F ) . A similar inhibition was seen if cytosolic HIV - 1 entry was measured by quantifying virus - associated b - lactamase activity ( Figure 3J ) or by visualizing synthesis of the HIV structural protein p24 ( Figure S3G ) . These data conﬁrm that CME is the main route of productive HIV entry in this cell line . Our results demonstrate that pitstop 2 is an efﬁcient and selec - tive inhibitor of CME that acts via blocking ligand access to the clathrin TD . The Clathrin TD Plays a Crucial Role in Regulating Coated Pit Dynamics Given the lack of knowledge regarding the physiological role of ligand binding to the clathrin TD in endocytosis , we chose to study clathrin dynamics in more detail . Live Cos7 cells stably expressing eGFP - clathrin light chains ( LC ) were monitored by total internal reﬂection microscopy ( TIRFM ) . Consistent with previous data ( Ehrlich et al . , 2004 ) clathrin LC - containing CCPs formed and disappeared at the plasma membrane with most events exhibiting lifetimes between 26 and 89 s . A smaller frac - tion of long - lived clathrin - coated structures were detected with lifetimes of more than 90 s ( Saffarian et al . , 2009 ) . Treatment of cells with pitstop 2 led to a dramatic shift toward long - lived cla - thrin - coated structures , many of which exhibiting lifetimes well beyond our usual imaging time ( limited by the eventual bleaching of clathrin LC - eGFP ) ( Figures 4A and 4B ) . This is obvious from kymographs ( Figure 4A ) and from cumulative plots of CCP life - times ( Figure 4C ) . Increased CCP lifetimes were paired with Cell 146 , 471 – 484 , August 5 , 2011 ª 2011 Elsevier Inc . 475 Figure 3 . Pitstop 2 Reversibly Inhibits Clathrin - Mediated Endocytosis ( A ) Pitstop 2 reversibly inhibits Tf uptake . After 15 min preincubation HeLa cells were incubated with Alexa 568 - Tf in the presence of DMSO or 30 m M pitstop 2 for 15 min . Tf uptake is seen to resume after washout of the drug for 1 hr .

We noted a slightly increased dimming of CCPs in confocal when compared to TIRF imaging , presumably due to increased bleaching of stalled clathrin puncta . Thus , surprisingly , pitstop 2 - mediated interference with clathrin TD - ligand association does not have a strong effect on the stability of membrane - associated clathrin , but dramati - cally perturbs CCP dynamics . To corroborate the role of clathrin TD function in CCP dynamics ﬂuorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) was paired with live cell spinning disc confocal microscopy imaging . Following the bleaching laser pulse clathrin LC - eGFP ﬂuorescence rapidly recovered to about 80 % of its initial value with a t of approximately 30 s in control cells , consistent with the mean CCP lifetimes measured by TIRFM - based particle tracking ( compare Figures 4B and 4C ) . Pitstop 2 - treated cells did not show recovery of clathrin LC - eGFP ﬂuorescence within 120 s , conﬁrming that clathrin TD function indeed regulates CCP dynamics . Recovery was so slow that a reliable t value could not be determined under the imaging conditions . These data indicate that pitstop 2 stalls the maturation and / or consumption of pre - existing CCPs . We next asked whether clathrin TD function may be required for the de novo assembly of clathrin - coated structures . We made use of 1 - butanol , an alcohol which depletes cellular PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels causing CCP disassembly and loss of clathrin from the plasma membrane ( Boucrot et al . , 2006 ; Henne et al . , 2010 ) . Clathrin LC - eGFP containing pits rapidly reformed after washout of 1 - butanol in control and pitstop 2 - treated cells ( Fig - ure S3A ) . To corroborate that TD - ligand interactions are not required for the de novo clathrin recruitment , we re - expressed siRNA - resistant clathrin HC mutants in cells depleted of endog - enous clathrin HC . Mutation of R64A / Q89M / F91A within the cla - thrin TD nearly abolished its ability to associate with amphiphysin to an extent similar to that seen for an amphiphysin mutant lack - ing its clathrin box ( compare Figure 1F ) but did not impair recruit - ment of full - length clathrin HC ( R64A / Q89M / F91A ) to the plasma membrane or to the TGN ( Figure S3C ) . A clathrin HC mutant lacking the TD altogether ( D TD ) was also recruited to mem - branes ( Figure S3C ) . We conclude that TD - ligand interactions are dispensable for clathrin recruitment to membranes . If indeed pitstop 2 mainly interferes with CCP dynamics , one would expect relatively subtle effects on the distribution of endogenous endocytic proteins . Indeed , no signiﬁcant changes were observed in the colocalization of clathrin , FCHo 1 / 2 , inter - sectin , AP - 2 , or dynamin 2 ( Figures S4A and S4B ) . We also did not detect overt changes with respect to the steady - state local - ization of HIP1 , Dab2 , GAK / auxilin2 , or CALM ( data not shown ) . This is not surprising as many endocytic proteins likely are re - tained at the plasma membrane by multiple interactions , i . e . , by binding to AP - 2 and / or membrane PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 as well as to each other ( Schmid and McMahon , 2007 ) . Among the endocytic proteins analyzed , two clathrin acces - sory proteins displayed altered localizations . Endogenous am - phiphysin 1 was partially lost from the plasma membrane of pit - stop 2 - treated cells ( Figures S4C and S4D ) . Conversely , the mean intensity of SNX9 - containing puncta was increased in pit - stop 2 - treated cells , often resulting in the formation of large clus - ters ( Figures S3E – S3G ) . These ﬁndings correlate with the recent observation that amphiphysin and SNX9 operate at consecutive steps during CME ( Taylor et al . , 2011 ) and suggest that clathrin TD interactions may coordinate turnover of endocytic proteins at nascent CCPs . We also determined the distribution of various TGN or endoso - mal proteins including AP - 1 , EEA1 , Gadkin , CD63 , TGN46 , or the mannose 6 - phosphate receptor MPR46 . None of these factors showed a signiﬁcant change in localization within 15 min of pit - stop 2 application ( Figures S5A and S5B ) . We did , however , note a partial shift of transferrin receptor ( TfR ) from perinuclear endosomes to the cell surface of pitstop 2 - treated cells ( Fig - ure S4H ) , consistent with defective Tf endocytosis ( Figures 3A and 3B ) . Dynamics of FCHo2 , AP - 2 , and Dynamin in Pitstop 2 - Treated Cells Since pitstop 2 impaired clathrin dynamics we next examined the behavior of other key endocytic proteins , which act either prior to or concomitant with clathrin assembly . FCHo proteins are early - acting factors that link PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - rich sites to AP - 2 binding scaffolds such as intersectin and Eps15 / Eps15R ( Henne et al . , 2010 ) . TIRFM - based imaging of eGFP - FCHo2 dynamics in Cos7 cells revealed that FCHo2 - containing structures were rela - tively long - lived , with lifetimes between 26 s and over 120 s . The mean lifetimes of FCHo2 - eGFP - containing puncta were dramat - ically increased following application of pitstop 2 with puncta ap - pearing nearly immobile ( Figures 5A and 5B ) . Moreover , FCHo2 - positive spots failed to recover in FRAP experiments ( Figures 5C and 5D ) . Hence , clathrin TD function is required for the produc - tive consumption of nascent CCPs containing FCHo2 . Consis - tent with this and with the observation that pitstop 2 displaces the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - consuming 5 - phosphatases OCRL and synaptoja - nin 1 - p170 from the clathrin TD ( Figure 1E ) pitstop 2 treatment also stabilized clathrin coats on membranes in vitro ( Figures S3D and S3E ) . Surprisingly , pitstop 2 induced a comparatively minor shift in the mean life span of AP - 2 s - eGFP puncta ( Figures 5E and 5F ) . ( E ) Pearson’s correlation between Alexa 488 - EGF and AP - 2 .

These results are consistent with our observation that pitstop 2 - treated cells remain able to sequester cargo into CCPs , a process largely mediated by AP - 2 ( compare Figures 3D and 3E ) . Finally , we investigated the life span of the ﬁssioning enzyme dynamin 2 . Dynamin 2 - eGFP displayed a lifetime distribution similar to that observed for AP - 2 or clathrin . Pitstop 2 shifted this distribution to longer life spans with a behavior intermediary between the effects seen for clathrin and AP - 2 ( Figures 5G and 5H ) . Prolonged lifetimes of dynamin puncta at CCPs also ﬁt well with the altered distribution of the dynamin - binding clathrin accessory proteins amphiphysin and SNX9 observed in pitstop - treated cells ( Figures S3C – S3G ) . Morphological Analysis of Pitstop 2 - Treated Cells Our live imaging data collectively argue that pitstop 2 - mediated inhibition of CME results from defects in endocytic protein dynamics . As CME is a constitutive process in nonneuronal cells with CCPs forming and disassembling continuously , one would expect that acute perturbation of endocytic protein dynamics by pitstop 2 - mediated inhibition of clathrin TD function results in acute ‘‘trapping’’ of clathrin - coated intermediates represent - ing multiple stages of the pathway . To this aim , control or pitstop 2 - treated Cos7 cells were subjected to electron microscopic and morphometric analyses . Clathrin - coated endocytic intermedi - ates were classiﬁed according to their morphological proﬁles as shallow CCPs , nonconstricted u - shaped CCPs , constricted U - shaped CCPs corresponding to late ﬁssion stages , and struc - tures containing a complete clathrin coat ( Figure 6A ) . These latter intermediates may comprise free clathrin - coated vesicles as well as late intermediates that remain attached to the plasma membrane . Endocytic proﬁles of control cells and those incu - bated with pitstop 2 appeared very similar . No major changes in the total number of CCPs ( Figure 6B ) or in the representation of various endocytic stages were observed ( Figure 6C ) . We conclude that pitstop - mediated inhibition of clathrin TD function acutely arrests CME at multiple stages . Pitstops Inhibit Endocytic Recycling of Synaptic Vesicles in Neurons and In Situ One of the most prominent functions of CME in vertebrates is the exo - endocytic recycling of synaptic vesicle ( SV ) membranes at nerve terminals ( Dittman and Ryan , 2009 ) . Unlike CME in non - neuronal cells endocytic reformation of SVs in neurons is strictly coupled to stimulation - dependent exocytosis resulting in a wave of endocytic activity ( Dittman and Ryan , 2009 ) . We tested the effects of pitstop 2 - mediated clathrin inhibition on SV reforma - tion in primary hippocampal neurons . Chemical stimulation of SV exocytosis resulted in a pronounced depletion of SVs from nerve terminals of pitstop 2 - treated neurons , suggesting that SV reformation by endocytosis was inhibited . No signiﬁcant changes in SV numbers were seen in resting control neurons ( Figures S6A – S6C ) . Loss of SV membranes in pitstop 2 - treated neurons appeared to be counterbalanced partly by presynaptic membrane expansion ( Figure S6D ) . The poor membrane penetration of pitstop 1 prevented anal - ysis of its effects on endocytosis in living cells . However , its high solubility in aqueous media provided ideal conditions for its intracellular application by microinjection . We therefore as - sessed the effect of pitstops 1 and 2 on SV endocytosis in the lamprey reticulospinal synapse ( Pechstein et al . , 2010 ) . We mi - croinjected pitstop 1 into lamprey reticulospinal axons and stim - ulated at 5 Hz for 20 min to induce SV recycling at a physiological rate . Analysis of ultrathin sections revealed a profound loss of SVs at active zones in synapses from these axons ( Figures 7A , 7B , and 7G ) , compared to control noninjected axons ( Figure 7C ) . No morphological alterations were observed in axons microin - jected with pitstop 1 and kept at rest ( Figure 7E ) . Loss of SVs in stimulated axons was accompanied by a dramatic expansion of the plasma membrane , which due to anatomical constraints formed membrane pockets around the active zone ( Figures 7A , 7B , and 7H ) . A signiﬁcant accumulation of CCPs was observed within the membrane expansions compared with control syn - apses ( Figures 7A – 7C and 7I ) . Consistent with our observations in Cos7 cells , no dramatic alterations in stage representation of CCPs were observed ( Figure 7J ) . No detectable morphological differences of CCPs were detected at high - magniﬁcation ( Figures 7D and 7E ) . A similar phenotype including a pronounced loss of SVs and accumulation of multistage CCPs was observed in pitstop 2 - injected reticulospinal synapses ( Figure S7 ) . We conclude that intra - axonal application of pitstops strongly inhibits SV recycling in situ by inhibiting CME at multiple stages . DISCUSSION We have developed chemically distinct small molecule inhibitors of clathrin TD function termed pitstops that competitively inter - fere with the association of endocytic clathrin box ligands . In vitro experiments in conjunction with structural data based on protein X - ray crystallography as well as experiments in living cells clearly demonstrated that these compounds selectively perturb clathrin TD function . Effects of pitstop 2 on CME are evident within a few minutes of cell treatment , presumably only being limited by the rate of drug diffusion across the cell membrane . We observe reversible inhibition of CME in a broad variety of cells at concentrations closely matching the IC 50 values of the in vitro binding experiments . While pitstop 2 readily crosses cell membranes , pitstop 1 has greatly reduced efﬁcacy , limiting its use to live cell applications based on intracellular application . The similarity of phenotypes exhibited by pitstops 1 and 2 in lamprey reticulospinal synapses in situ and in Cos 7 cells in vitro suggests that both compounds share a common ( E ) Pitstop 2 stalls clathrin dynamics .

In the pres - ence of pitstop 2 clathrin - independent internalization pathways and secretory trafﬁc ( data not shown ) remain unperturbed . Therefore , pitstops represent new cellular tools to selectively inhibit CME . Pitstops Block CME by Interfering with CCP Dynamics The use of pitstops in living cells revealed an unexpected role for the clathrin TD and its ligands in endocytic pit dynamics while clathrin recruitment was unperturbed . Together with the obser - vation that clathrin lacking its TD is targeted to CCPs , it is likely that other interactions such as the association of the b - ear domain of AP - 2 with the clathrin leg ( Knuehl et al . , 2006 ) mediate clathrin recruitment to membranes . Our data are explained by a model where pitstops interfere with the progression of CCPs at multiple stages , consistent with the functional diversity of clathrin TD ligands . Clathrin is one of a few molecules within the endocytic network with the ability to spatiotemporally regulate vesicle formation and disas - sembly after ﬁssion . Most endocytic proteins partially lack stable tertiary structure or contain extensive segments of natively unfolded polypeptide chains , but clathrin triskelia are stable enti - ties with a ﬁxed arrangement , distance , and geometry between their TDs ( Brodsky et al . , 2001 ) . We , thus , favor a model whereby clathrin assembled at nascent endocytic sites serves as an orga - nizing scaffold that regulates CCP dynamics by providing spatially deﬁned binding sites on its TD for accessory proteins that drive CCP maturation and disassembly ( Figure 1A , right ) . The speciﬁc mechanisms that regulate such transitions within an assembling or disassembling CCP are unknown , but pitstops together with dynamin inhibitors ( Joshi et al . , 2010 ; Macia et al . , 2006 ) may provide powerful tools to tackle these questions . Unraveling the Roles of Clathrin in Cell Physiology Evidence from morphological , genetic , and knockdown studies has suggested that CME may be a key mechanism for SV recy - cling ( Dittman and Ryan , 2009 ) . The fact that synapses can adapt to chronic loss of endocytic proteins is a substantial drawback for RNAi and genetic approaches . Our data using pitstops provide a direct demonstration for an important role of clathrin Figure 6 .

The development of pitstops will allow further molecular dissection of clathrin function under different stimulation para - digms and in different preparations . Our data also lend strong support to the hypothesis that HIV enters cells largely via CME ( Daecke et al . , 2005 ; Miyauchi et al . , 2009 ) . Hence , we predict that the inhibitors developed here or derivatives thereof may serve as lead compounds for the development of drugs blocking the entry of viruses and path - ogens , which hijack the clathrin machinery , including HIV , hepa - titis C virus ( Blanchard et al . , 2006 ) , ebola virus ( Bhattacharyya et al . , 2010 ) , and Listeria monocytogenes ( Veiga et al . , 2007 ) . It is to be expected that acute interference with clathrin TD function will affect other clathrin - dependent pathways . Clathrin plays roles in bidirectional trafﬁc between the trans - Golgi net - work and endosomes , a pathway mediated by AP - 1 and GGA adaptors ( Bonifacino and Traub , 2003 ; Hirst et al . , 2009 ) . Clathrin coats have also been observed on endosomes , where clathrin may fulﬁll a structural role in the segregation of endosomal membrane domains involved in targeting of growth factor recep - tors ( Goh et al . , 2010 ) to the multivesicular body pathway or in directing retrograde transport ( Saint - Pol et al . , 2004 ) . Finally , clathrin has been detected at the mitotic spindle where it has been proposed to stabilize microtubules ( Royle et al . , 2005 ) . Whether and to which degree these functions depend on the association of conventional clathrin box ligands with the TD can now be addressed using the small molecule inhibitor approach . Pitstops will serve as an important tool to address these ques - tions as well as more generally the role of clathrin function in cell physiology including cell signaling . The availability of crystal structures of pitstops in complex with the clathrin TD will pave the way for the development of second - and third - generation compounds with increased afﬁnity and improved molecular properties that could serve as prodrugs for the treatment of Figure 7 .

Nonspeciﬁc binding was blocked by incubation in 50 m l blocking buffer ( 20 mM HEPES [ pH 7 . 4 ] , 50 mM NaCl , 1 mM DTT , 1 mM PMSF , 2 % BSA , 2 . 5 % milk ) overnight at 4 (cid:1) C . Following extensive washes with 20 mM HEPES ( pH 7 . 4 ) , 50 mM NaCl , 0 . 05 % Tween 20 , chemical compounds diluted in DMSO ( 10 m l ) were added and incubated together with GST - tagged protein for 1 hr at RT in screening buffer . After three washes , HRP - coupled anti - GST antibodies were added in screening buffer and the plate was incubated for 15 min at RT .
