Methods We used data from a cross - sectional COVID - 19 questionnaire ( September - December 2020 ) linked to baseline ( 2011 – 2015 ) and follow - up ( 2015 – 2018 ) data from a population - based cohort including 23 , 757 adults 50 + years to examine how age , sex , and pre - pandemic physical , psychological , social , and functional health were related to the severity and persistence of 23 COVID - 19 - related symptoms experienced between March 2020 and questionnaire completion . Results The most common symptoms are fatigue , dry cough , muscle / joint pain , sore throat , headache , and runny nose ; reported by over 25 % of participant who had ( n = 121 ) or did not have ( n = 23 , 636 ) COVID - 19 during the study period . The cumulative incidence of moder - ate / severe symptoms in people with COVID - 19 is more than double that reported by people without COVID - 19 , with the absolute difference ranging from 16 . 8 % ( runny nose ) to 37 . 8 % ( fatigue ) . Approximately 60 % of male and 73 % of female participants with COVID - 19 report at least one symptom persisting > 1 month . Persistence > 1 month is higher in females ( aIRR = 1 . 68 ; 95 % CI : 1 . 03 , 2 . 73 ) and those with multimorbidity ( aIRR = 1 . 90 ; 95 % CI : 1 . 02 , 3 . 49 ) ; persistence > 3 months decreases by 15 % with each unit increase in subjective social status after adjusting for age , sex and multimorbidity . Conclusions Many people living in the community who were not hospitalized for COVID - 19 still experience symptoms 1 - and 3 - months post infection . These data suggest that additional supports , for example access to rehabilitative care , are needed to help some individuals fully recover . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s43856 - 023 - 00266 - 0 OPEN 1 Department of Health Research Methods , Evidence , and Impact , McMaster University , Hamilton , ON , Canada . 2 Labarge Centre for Mobility in Aging , McMaster University , Hamilton , ON , Canada . 3 McMaster Institute for Research on Aging , McMaster University , Hamilton , ON , Canada . 4 School of Rehabilitation Science , McMaster University , Hamilton , ON , Canada . 5 Division of Geriatric Medicine , Department of Medicine , Cumming School of Medicine , University of Calgary , Calgary , AB , Canada . 6 Department of Epidemiology , Biostatistics , and Occupational Health , McGill University , Montreal , QC , Canada . 7 Department of Medicine , McGill University , Montreal , QC , Canada . 8 Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre , Montreal , QC , Canada . 9 Department of Community Health & Epidemiology , Dalhousie University , Halifax , NS , Canada . 10 Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science , University of Waterloo , Waterloo , ON , Canada . * A list of authors and their af ﬁ liations appears at the end of the paper . ✉ email : praina @ mcmaster . ca Plain Language Summary Some people who develop COVID - 19 experience persistence of symptoms . Here , we aimed to understand the factors associated with the severity and persistence of these symptoms in adults 50 years and older living in the community who had COVID - 19 . Using information provided by 23 , 757 participants from across Canada we compared the symptoms between those who had COVID - 19 and those who did not . The number and severity of symptoms in participants who had COVID - 19 was beyond what would be expected due to other causes . Over two - thirds of participants who had COVID - 19 reported symptoms persisting for more than one month , and over half of the participants more than three months . Symptom persis - tence was higher in females , those with multiple chronic conditions , and lower perceived social status . This suggests that a substantial proportion of people who were not hospitalized for COVID - 19 may require further healthcare assistance . COMMUNICATIONS MEDICINE | ( 2023 ) 3 : 36 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s43856 - 023 - 00266 - 0 | www . nature . com / commsmed 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 89 0 ( ) : , ; I n addition to the immediate health consequences of cor - onavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) , it is becoming increas - ingly evident that many people experience persistent symptoms for more than 4 weeks , often termed “ long COVID ” 1 . On February 25 , 2021 , the World Health Organization urged national authorities to prioritize the understanding the long - term consequences of COVID - 19 infections 2 . Research on how best to identify those at greatest risk of long COVID is urgently required 3 , especially in older adults 4 . To date , most studies of symptom persistence have been con - ducted amongst individuals requiring hospitalization for COVID - 19 5 – 8 . The largest study conducted by Huang et al 9 . found that 76 % of patients reported at least one symptom 6 months after symptom onset , the most common being fatigue , weakness , sleep dif ﬁ culties , and anxiety / depression . While information on survi - vors of serious COVID - 19 illness is critically important , millions have managed COVID - 19 in the community without being hospitalized 10 , 11 . Of the few studies examining symptom persis - tence in both hospitalized and non - hospitalized adults , most use convenience sampling and / or have low response rates limiting the generalizability of results 1 , 12 – 15 , or focus on special subgroups ( e . g . , COVID cases with severe symptoms ) 16 – 18 Those using administrative data 19 , 20 include well de ﬁ ned populations , but include limited information on socio - demographic and con - textual variables that can help better understand symptom per - sistence . Importantly , only one study includes a control group 20 making it dif ﬁ cult to determine to what extent the long - term symptoms reported by people with COVID - 19 can be directly attributed to SARS CoV - 2 infection . Furthermore , only one other long - COVID study is embedded in an existing population - based cohort . Matta et al . examine symptoms persisting ≥ 8 weeks among French adults 21 using both information on the presence of antibodies to SARS - CoV - 2 virus and self - report COVID - 19 sta - tus , but does not examine other relevant de ﬁ nitions of symptom persistence , such as post - acute ( > 1 month ) and chronic ( > 3 months ) as suggested by Greenhalgh et al . 22 . To help address these research gaps and better understand community - based symptom persistence , we analyze data from a COVID - 19 questionnaire launched in an existing population - based cohort , the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging ( CLSA ) . In this study , we estimate the cumulative incidence of symptoms reported during the pandemic in participants with and without a COVID - 19 diagnosis by age and sex . In those with COVID - 19 , we further examine symptom persistence and the factors asso - ciated with the number of persistent symptoms . Methods Study design / setting . Globally , the CLSA is one of the largest and most comprehensive research platforms examining health and aging 23 . Recruitment and CLSA baseline data were collected on 51 , 338 participants in 2011 – 2015 , follow - up 1 ( FUP1 ) was completed on 48 , 893 participants ( 95 % retention ) in 2015 – 2018 , and FUP2 was completed in mid - 2021 . The CLSA COVID - 19 study was launched on April 15 , 2020 and comprised a COVID - 19 baseline questionnaire , weekly / biweekly / monthly symptoms questionnaires , and an Exit questionnaire . The Exit questionnaire ( September 29 – December 29 , 2020 ) captured information on COVID - 19 symptom persistence . This analysis uses data from the CLSA baseline , FUP1 , and the COVID - 19 questionnaires . The study was approved by the Hamilton Integrated Research Ethics Board and by the research ethics boards of all the participating institutions across Canada ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . Written informed consent was obtained all participants . Participants had the study and data collection procedures explained to them and had the opportunity to seek clari ﬁ cation before consenting . Participants . CLSA participants were community - living adults aged 45 – 85 years residing in the ten provinces of Canada at recruitment ( 2010 – 2015 ) . Full - time armed forces members , people living on First Nations reserves , residing in institutions , unable to respond in English or French , or with cognitive impairment were excluded . Of 51 , 338 CLSA participants 42 , 700 were invited to take part in the CLSA COVID - 19 study . The 8633 excluded comprised individuals who died ( n = 2500 ) , had with - drawn prior to FUP2 ( n = 3406 ) , required a proxy ( n = 318 ) , or were unreachable for administrative reasons ( n = 2414 ) . Partici - pants with email addresses were invited to participate via a Web questionnaire ( n = 34 , 498 ) and all others completed telephone interviews ( n = 8202 ) . During the CLSA COVID - 19 Study recruitment process , an additional 166 participants were identi - ﬁ ed as deceased and 23 as needing a proxy to arrive at the overall eligible sample of 42 , 511 , of which 28 , 559 ( 67 . 2 % ) agreed to participate in the study and 24 , 114 ( 56 . 7 % ) completed the Exit questionnaire ( Supplementary Table 2a ) . Compared to those not participating ( n = 18 , 343 ) , those completing the Exit ques - tionnaire ( n = 24 , 114 ) were more likely to be aged 65 - 74 ( 34 . 7 % vs . 33 . 1 % ) , less likely to be < 55 ( 13 . 2 % vs . 18 . 20 % ) , and less likely to be a current smoker ( 5 . 8 % vs . 8 . 9 % ) . ( Supplementary Table 2b ) . Our analyses include participants who reported a positive test for or a physician diagnosis of COVID - 19 ( COVID - 19 group ) or did not ( non - COVID - 19 group ) . Participants who reported it was “ very likely ” they had COVID - 19 but did not have a positive test or diagnosis ( n = 357 ) were excluded from the primary analyses . A subgroup of these participants were included in sensitivity analyses ( see “ Statistical analysis ” ) . Variables . All CLSA questionnaires are available on the CLSA website ( https : / / www . clsa - elcv . ca / data - collection ) . COVID - 19 status / symptoms . Participants reporting a positive COVID - 19 test or were told they had COVID - 19 by a healthcare professional were considered “ COVID - 19 positive . ” We included those told by a healthcare professional as many people were not tested early in the pandemic 10 . Participants reporting they “ very likely ” had COVID - 19 but did not report a positive test or a physician diagnosis were excluded from analyses ( n = 357 ) . All Participants were asked if they experienced any of 23 COVID - related symptoms since March 1 , 2020 and if so to rate the symptom as mild , moderate , or severe . There was also the option for participants to report “ other ” symptoms beyond the 23 included in the survey . Participants with COVID - 19 were further asked how long the symptom persisted ( 2 weeks or less , > 2 weeks , > 1 month , > 2 months , > 3 months , or ongoing ) . We considered two persistent symptom de ﬁ nitions based on the Greenhalgh et al 22 . classi ﬁ cation of post - acute ( > 1 month ) and chronic ( > 3 months ) COVID - 19 . Symptom status was also collected at the baseline , 2 bi - weekly , and 3 monthly questionnaires . For each of the 23 symptoms we summed the number of times the symptom was reported across the six questionnaires ( n _ sym ) . Thus , for participants responding to all six questionnaires n _ sym was between 0 and 6 . To assess the validity of self - reported symptom persistence in the COVID - 19 positive participants at the Exit interview , we compared the mean number of symptoms ( n _ sym ) for those indicating the symptom was persistent ( > 1 month ) to those who did not . For each symptom , n _ sym was signi ﬁ cantly higher in the persistent symptom group ; with an average of 2 . 4 more reports of the symptom over the six follow - up questionnaires ( Supplementary Table 3 ) . When persistence status was missing ( n = 52 ( 2 . 1 % ) ) , symptoms reported on the previous six questionnaires were used to impute the status when possible . For example , if a participant ARTICLE COMMUNICATIONS MEDICINE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s43856 - 023 - 00266 - 0 2 COMMUNICATIONS MEDICINE | ( 2023 ) 3 : 36 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s43856 - 023 - 00266 - 0 | www . nature . com / commsmed with missing persistence data reported a symptom at the Exit but did report the symptom on any of the six preceding ques - tionnaires , their symptoms status was imputed “ not persistent ” and if a participant reported the symptom at all three monthly questionnaires preceding the Exit interview their symptom status was imputed “ persistent ” for both de ﬁ nitions ( > 1 month and > 3 months ) . As a sensitivity analysis we also used multiple imputations for missing persistence information . Covariates . All analyses included age ( 50 – 65 , 65 – 74 , and ≥ 75 years ) and sex . Regression analyses also included indicators of physical , psychological , and social health and function taken from the participants ’ FUP1 data ( pre - pandemic ) . Multimorbidity was based on the number of chronic conditions from 10 disease categories ( musculoskeletal , respiratory , cardiovascular , endo - crine - metabolic , neurological , gastrointestinal , genitourinary , ophthalmologic , renal , and cancer ) and categorized into “ 0 or 1 ” vs . 2 + . Self - reported depression and / or anxiety was considered an indicator of psychological health . Relative social standing was operationalized as a continuous variable using MacArthur social ladder scale 24 . Participants were asked to place themselves on a ladder where the steps represented where people stand in their communities ; the top step ( 10 ) represented the highest standing and bottom step ( 1 ) represented the lowest standing 25 . Partici - pants needing help with any of the following mobility - related activities of daily living : dressing , walking , getting to bed , bathing and toileting , shopping , or housework they were considered to have a functional limitation 26 . Statistics and reproducibility . Descriptive statistics were calcu - lated as mean ( standard deviation ( SD ) ) for continuous variables and n ( % ) for categorical variables ; standardized differences and two - sided p - values were reported comparing those with and without COVID - 19 . We graphically displayed the proportion of participants with and without COVID - 19 experiencing mild and moderate / severe symptoms for each of the 23 symptoms ordered by overall symptom cumulative incidence in the COVID - 19 group . Because multimorbidity is strongly associated with symptoms and was more common in the COVID - 19 group , we conducted a sensitivity analysis in which we used direct stan - dardization in the COVID - 19 group to re ﬂ ect the age , sex , and multimorbidity distribution of the non - COVID - 19 group . We further strati ﬁ ed these ﬁ gures by sex and age and qualitatively examined how patterns varied across sub - groups . We graphically summarized the 10 most prevalent persistent symptoms ( > 1 month and > 3 months ) reported as moderate / severe by the COVID - 19 group . We then calculated the overall number of persistent symptoms . Univariate and multivariable negative binomial regression was used to identify covariates associated with the risk of persistent symptoms . Negative binomial regression was chosen rather than Poisson regression because the data were over - dispersed . Data were analyzed separately for the two persistence de ﬁ nitions ( > 1 month and > 3 months ) . Age and sex were forced into each multivariable model and then a stepwise procedure was used to identity additional indicators of physical ( multimorbidity ) , psychological ( anxiety / depression ) , social ( subjective social status ) health , and physical function ( mobility - related activities of daily living limitations ) were independently associated with persistence using a p < 0 . 1 as criteria for inclusion . Model ﬁ t was assessed using the deviance goodness of ﬁ t test . Incidence rate ratios ( IRR ) and 95 % con ﬁ dence intervals ( CIs ) were reported . As a sensitivity analysis multiple imputation using Classi ﬁ cation and Regression Trees method was conducted to create 5 datasets used to estimate the IRRs for the ﬁ nal models . Finally , for 15 participants indicating they “ very likely ” had COVID - 19 but did not report a positive test or a physician diagnosis ( currently excluded from our analysis ) , we had seroprevalence results indicating that they had COVID - 19 antibodies and were not vaccinated ( see details in Supplementary Table 7 ) . Therefore , as a ﬁ nal sensitivity analysis , we included these participants in the persistent symptom regression analysis . All analyses were conducted using R version 4 . 1 . 0 27 or SAS Enterprise Guide 8 . 3 ( https : / / www . sas . com / content / dam / SAS / en _ us / doc / factsheet / sas - enterprise - guide - 101431 . pdf ) .

Compared to the non - COVID - 19 group ( n = 23 , 636 ) , those reporting COVID - 19 ( n = 121 ) had more multimorbidity ( 78 . 15 % vs . 67 . 31 % ) , depression / anxiety ( 32 . 50 % vs . 20 . 68 % ) , mobility limitations ; 26 . 27 % vs . 18 . 18 % ) , and lower subjective social status ( 6 . 10 vs . 6 . 45 ) but there were no signi ﬁ cant differences in sex or age . Of the COVID - 19 participants , 14 reported visiting the emergency department and 7 ( 5 . 8 % ) reported a hospital admission , of whom 3 ( 2 . 5 % ) reported an ICU stay . Figure 1 displays the proportion of participants with and without COVID - 19 reporting 23 symptoms since the beginning of the pandemic . Over 25 % of both groups reported fatigue , dry cough , muscle or joint pain , sore throat , headache , and runny nose . While the overall cumulative incidence of many symptoms was high in both groups , the proportion reporting moderate / severe symptoms was consistently higher in the COVID - 19 group with over 35 % reporting moderate / severe fatigue and muscle or joint pain . Symptoms in the COVID - 19 group were only slightly attenuated after direct standardization ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . Other symptoms reported by participants ( beyond the 23 listed ) are summarized in Supplementary Table 4 . Female participants with COVID - 19 tended to report more moderate / severe symptoms than males ( Fig . 2a , b ) . This was most evident for fatigue ( 52 . 7 % vs . 44 . 7 % ) , muscle and joint pain ( 40 . 5 % vs . 30 . 4 % ) , headache ( 32 . 4 % vs . 19 . 2 % ) , and decreased sense of smell ( 33 . 78 % vs . 14 . 9 % ) . Generally , participants with COVID - 19 who were < 65 years old reported a higher cumulative incidence of symptoms than those of age 65 – 74 and 75 + years ; however , a higher proportion of the symptoms reported in the 75 + COVID - 19 group were moderate / severe ( Supplementary Fig . 2a – c ) . For participants with COVID - 19 , persistence of > 1 month and > 3 months was reported for both mild and moderate / severe symptoms , but persistence patterns varied by symptom ( Fig . 3 ) . Over 15 % reported moderate / severe fatigue , dry cough , and decreased sense of smell , and over 10 % reported moderate / severe shortness of breath , muscle or joint pain , or runny nose for > 1 month ; over 10 % reported mild fatigue for > 3 months . In addition , over half of the respondents reporting moderate / severe shortness or breath , decreased sense of smell , trouble with balance , and wet cough indicated the symptom lasted > 1 month and over a third indicated they lasted > 3 months . Approximately 60 % of male participants reported at least one symptom persisting > 1 month compared to 75 % of female participants , with over 10 % of females reporting 8 or more persistent symptoms compared to 4 % of males ( Supplementary Fig . 3a ) . More than 50 % of male and 40 % of female participants reported no persistent symptoms > 3 months , while over 10 % of females compared to 2 % of males reported 5 or more ( Supplementary Fig . 3b ) . There were no consistent patterns with age ( Supplementary Fig . 4a , b ) . Table 2 and Supplementary Table 5 presents the univariate and multivariable regression results for the number of persistent symptoms > 1 month and > 3 months . In both univariable models , female sex was associated with a higher rate of persistent symptoms ( 1 . 68 times higher ( 95 % CI 1 . 03 , 2 . 74 ) for > 1 month and 1 . 95 times higher ( 95 % CI 1 . 09 , 3 . 45 ) for > 3 months ) and the rate did not differ by age group .

Whereas other studies have not differentiated between mild and moderate / severe symptoms , we consistently found higher symptom cumulative incidence and severity in the COVID - 19 group beyond the background level observed in community - living middle - aged and older adults during the same time frame . In our study of primarily non - hospitalized patients with COVID - 19 , over two - thirds reported at least one symptom persisting > 1 month and over half reported at least one symptom persisting > 3 months . This extends previous work and further substantiates long - COVID as an important syndrome in both hospitalized and non - hospitalized individuals . We demonstrated a higher cumulative incidence and severity of symptoms in participants with COVID - 19 compared to those without . Lund et al . 20 was the only other population - based study examining symptom as the time of COVID - 19 to include a comparison group . They used information from Danish pre - scription , patient , and health insurance registries and propensity - score weighting to compare PCR - test positive and negative individuals with respect to hospital - based diagnoses and pre - scriptions , as well as general practitioner and outpatient clinical visits in 2 weeks to 6 months after diagnosis . While they did not ﬁ nd differences in overall hospital - based diagnoses or prescrip - tions between those who tested positive and negative , they did ﬁ nd increased prior event adjusted rate ratios for general prac - titioner and outpatient clinic visits , suggesting that persistent symptoms may lead to increased healthcare utilization but not to the initiation of hospital - based acute treatment . Most symptom persistence studies to date have been con - ducted in hospitalized patients . While hospital - based cohorts include the most severe cases of COVID - 19 , our study provides important evidence for similar levels of persistent symptoms in a population - based cohort where the vast majority of partici - pants with COVID - 19 , like the general population , did not require hospitalization . In recent systematic reviews , the med - ian prevalence of ≥ 1 post - acute symptom has been reported as 70 . 0 % ( IQR , 46 . 3 – 78 . 9 % ) by Nalbandian et al . 6 and 72 . 5 % ( IQR , 55 . 0 – 80 . 0 % ) by Nasserie et al . 5 . This is in line with our estimate of 67 . 8 % having at least one symptom persisting > 1 month and higher than 53 . 4 % persisting > 3 months in community - living individuals with COVID - 19 . The largest multicenter hospital - based study , PHOSP - COVID , found that only 28 . 8 % of patient were fully recovered at a median of 5 . 9 months post - discharge 28 . In our study , only 5 . 8 % of indi - viduals with COVID - 19 reported any hospitalization . There are fewer studies of non - hospitalized individuals with COVID - 19 . Hernandez - Romieu et al . 19 reported 68 % of participants had a new diagnosis ( i . e . , a new ICD - 10 code ) within 1 – 6 months , Jacobson et al . 13 reported 66 . 9 % of participants had at least one symptom at a median of 4 months , and Gaber reported 45 % still had symptoms 3 - 4 months post COVID - 19 diagnosis . While the estimated cumulative incidence of persistent symp - toms is slightly lower in primarily non - hospitalized groups , it is nonetheless substantial . The largest community - based study examining 29 persistent symptoms including participants from the REACT - 2 study 29 found 37 . 7 % of participants reported symptoms at 12 weeks . Similar to studies in hospitalized and non - hospitalized individuals with COVID - 19 5 , 6 , 12 – 14 , 19 , 21 , 28 , 29 , we found the most commonly reported persistent symptoms were fatigue , shortness of breath , dry cough , and muscle and joint pain ; however , Matta 21 and Whitaker 29 also reported sleep problems , which we did not capture . We also found that over a third of individuals with COVID - 19 who reported moderate / severe shortness of breath , decreased sense of smell , trouble with balance , and wet cough indicated that these symptoms persisted for > 3 months , consistent with NICE guidance on long COVID ( symptoms lasting > 12 weeks ) 30 .

ARTICLE COMMUNICATIONS MEDICINE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s43856 - 023 - 00266 - 0 6 COMMUNICATIONS MEDICINE | ( 2023 ) 3 : 36 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s43856 - 023 - 00266 - 0 | www . nature . com / commsmed many of these symptoms can be improved with rehabilitation and these data suggest there may be unmet needs for rehabi - litative care among community - dwelling patients with COVID - 19 who did not require hospital treatment 31 , 32 . Finally , we found the rate of persistent symptoms was higher in females , those with pre - pandemic multimorbidity and lower levels of subjective social status but did not differ signi ﬁ cantly by age . There have been mixed results on the association between symptom persistence and age with some studies reporting an association with symptom persistence 12 or post - COVID - 19 healthcare utilization 19 and others not 13 , 15 . Although we found differences in the pattern of mild and moderate / severe symptom cumulative incidence by age group qualitatively , we did not ﬁ nd an association between age group and the rate of persistent symptoms in our regression analysis . While the associations with sex 13 – 15 , 19 , 28 , 29 and multimorbidity 13 , 15 , 19 , 28 , 29 , 33 have been pre - viously reported , no studies to date have examined pre - pandemic subjective social status . As many studies have used administrative data or patient records , this type of measure may not be readily available . Until recently no other studies have found an associa - tion between an indicator of socioeconomic status and symptom persistence 15 , 28 , 29 , 34 Interestingly , the two largest studies includ - ing community samples in the UK had con ﬂ icting results . Thompson et al . 34 conducted a meta - analysis of 10 longitudinal studies and electronic health records . The authors found no sig - ni ﬁ cant relationship between a postal - code based index of mul - tiple deprivation in the longitudinal studies but found those in the least deprived areas had increased odds of long - COVID com - pared to those in the most deprived areas . In contrast , Whitaker et al . 29 found an increased risk of persistent symptoms ( > 12 weeks ) for those living in areas of higher deprivation compared to those living in areas of lower deprivation . Our results using individual - level subjective social status as a predictor of symptom persistence at 3 months support the results of Whitaker et al . Subjective social status has been shown to explain variance beyond more objective measures of SES such as income and education 35 . Studies have also reported an association between race and symptom persistence 13 , 36 and in post - COVID - 19 healthcare utilization 19 . The National Institutes of Health has identi ﬁ ed the short - and long - term effects of COVID - 19 on health and how to reduce differential outcomes among racial and ethnic groups as a research priority 37 . Our ﬁ nding that lower subjective social status ( re ﬂ ecting the relative perception that individuals have of their place in the social hierarchy ) is asso - ciated with COVID - 19 symptom persistence may indicate that other social factors should be considered in addition to race in future studies . This study has many strengths including its design nested within an existing population - based nationally generalizable cohort 23 with pre - morbid data on many aspects of health . This study also has some limitations within which to interpret the results . While the CLSA cohort has been shown to be general - izable to the target population in Canada on many factors 23 , the response rate of the COVID - 19 study was 67 . 2 % which may lead to participation bias . This is not unusual compared to other studies in non - hospitalized patients that were not based on administrative data , where most response rates were less than 50 % 5 . One advantage of using the CLSA data is that we can understand how our COVID - 19 questionnaire study population compares to the full CLSA and the target population in Canada , which is not possible for most of the non - hospital - based and hospital - based cohorts published to date . Nonetheless , while our sample size is large , the actual number of participants with COVID - 19 was relatively small . While the number of COVID - 19 positive participants aligns with Canadian prevalence statistics in community - living older adults for the period in which the Exit questionnaire was administered 38 , the small sample size is re ﬂ ected in the width of our 95 % CIs . Furthermore , by excluding participants reporting they “ very likely ” had COVID - 19 but had no positive COVID - 19 test or physician diagnosis , we may have left out some participants who in fact had COVID - 19 . However , our results were robust to a number of sensitivity analyses . We also do not have the exact date that participants experienced COVID - 19 . It is possible that some participants had recovered from COVID - 19 less than 1 month prior to the questionnaire administration , and thus we may be underestimating the cumu - lative incidence of symptom persistence . Finally , we cannot comment on symptom persistence longer than 3 months . One additional potential limitation is that , despite that our COVID - 19 prevalence estimates are in - line with other PCR - test - based Canadian data sources at the time , our de ﬁ nition of COVID - 19 is based on self - report . Self - reported data are com - mon in population - based community cohorts and while they may be more susceptible to recall bias , a positive COVID - 19 test or physician diagnosis was such a salient event in the ﬁ rst year of the pandemic that recall bias is likely be minimal . Furthermore , measuring COVID - 19 antibody status retrospectively also has limitations . Matta et al . examined the association between antibody - based results and people ’ s self - reported belief that they had COVID - 19 with persistent symptoms in the CON - STNANCES cohort . Because that author found signi ﬁ cantly lar - ger associations with persistent symptoms with belief compared to antibody results they concluded that “ physical symptoms persisting 10 - 12 months after the COVID - 19 pandemic ﬁ rst wave may be associated more with the belief in having experienced COVID - 19 infection than with actually being infected with the SARS - CoV - 2 virus ” . This may be problematic however because their conclusions were based on measuring antibody status using dry blood spots collected up to 8 months post COVID - 19 infection . The authors did not consider the issue of false positives or the issue of decaying antibodies with time since infection which could decrease the presumed speci ﬁ city of their assay 39 . Even with a reported speci ﬁ city of 97 . 5 % the number of false positives can be substantial with a low cumulative incidence condition in a large population - based study . While the authors note in the discussion that the negative predictive value of the test in quite high ( 99 . 4 % ) they do not take into account that the positive predictive value of the assay is only 59 . 2 % . This is not to say that population - based seroprevalence studies are not impor - tant or reliable , but rather that the totality of evidence needs to be considered to move our understanding forward . With the new omicron variant , many countries have substantially reduced PCR testing . Self - reported COVID - 19 status and symptoms may become increasingly salient . Evidence from large well - established cohorts will allow us to examine factors related to health and aging pre - during - and eventually post - pandemic . Clinical and public health implications . All follow - up studies of hospitalized COVID - 19 patients post acute - care that incorpo - rated assessments of health - related quality of life and functional capacity measures have universally reported substantial de ﬁ cits in these domains 6 . However , because most COVID - 19 infected individuals are managed in the community 40 , it is of major public health importance to better understand the longer - term con - sequences of COVID - 19 in the general population . With millions of individuals experiencing COVID - 19 illness , persistent symp - toms are a burden on individuals and their families as well as on outpatient care and public health . We found that a non - trivial proportion of people living in the community who may not have been hospitalized for COVID - 19 still experience symptoms 1 month and even 3 months post infection .
