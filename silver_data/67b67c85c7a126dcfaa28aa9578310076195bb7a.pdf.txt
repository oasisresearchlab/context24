We aimed to 35 detect SARS - CoV - 2 surface and air contamination and study associated patient - level factors . 36 245 surface samples were collected from 30 airborne infection isolation rooms of COVID - 19 37 patients , and air sampling was conducted in 3 rooms . 38 Air sampling detected SARS - CoV - 2 PCR - positive particles of sizes > 4 µm and 1 - 4 µm in 39 two rooms , which warrants further study of the airborne transmission potential of SARS - 40 CoV - 2 . 56 . 7 % of rooms had at least one environmental surface contaminated . High touch 41 surface contamination was shown in ten ( 66 . 7 % ) out of 15 patients in the first week of illness , 42 and three ( 20 % ) beyond the first week of illness ( p = 0 . 010 ) . 43 All rights reserved .

Understanding the different 47 transmission routes of SARS - CoV - 2 is crucial in planning effective interventions to break the 48 chain of transmission . Although extensive surface contamination with SARS - CoV - 2 by a 49 symptomatic patient has been demonstrated 1 , little is known about airborne transmission of 50 SARS - CoV - 2 . It is also unknown if asymptomatic individuals pose the same environmental 51 contamination risk as symptomatic ones , although viral shedding has been demonstrated to 52 continue even after clinical recovery of COVID - 19 patients 2 . There are multiple reports of 53 asymptomatic patients testing positive for SARS - CoV - 2 3 , 4 , and the potential transmission of 54 the virus by an asymptomatic person has been described 5 . Therefore , viral contamination of 55 the air and surfaces surrounding asymptomatic or recovering COVID - 19 patients could have 56 serious implications for outbreak control strategies . This knowledge gap is recognized in the 57 Report of the WHO - China Joint Mission on Coronavirus 2019 6 . 58 The primary objective of our study was to identify potential patient - level risk factors for 59 environmental contamination by SARS - CoV - 2 by sampling the air and surfaces surrounding 60 hospitalized COVID - 19 patients at different stages of illness . 61 Methods 62 Study design , patient selection and data collection 63 We conducted this cross - sectional study in airborne infection isolation rooms ( AIIRs ) at the 64 National Centre for Infectious Diseases , Singapore . These rooms had 12 air changes per hour , 65 an average temperature of 23°C , relative humidity of 53 – 59 % , and exhaust flow of 579 . 6 66 m 3 / h . 67 All rights reserved .

Clinical characteristics , 69 including the presence of symptoms , day of illness , day of stay in the room , supplemental 70 oxygen requirement , and baseline characteristics , were collected . One patient from a 71 previously published pilot study on environmental sampling in the same facility ( Patient 30 ; 72 Supplemental Table 1 ) was also included in the current analysis 1 . 73 Air sampling 74 Six NIOSH BC 251 bioaerosol samplers were placed in each of three AIIRs in the general 75 ward to collect air samples . Particles collected with the NIOSH sampler are distributed into 76 three size fractions . Particles > 4 μm in diameter are collected in a 15 mL centrifuge tube , 77 particles 1 - 4 μm in diameter are collected in a 1 . 5 mL centrifuge tube , and particles < 1 μm in 78 diameter are collected in a self - assembled filter cassette containing a 37 - mm diameter , 79 polytetrafluoroethylene ( PTFE ) filter with 3μm pores . All NIOSH samplers were connected 80 to either SKC AirCheck TOUCH Pumps or SKC Universal air sampling pumps set at a flow - 81 rate of 3 . 5 L / min and run for four hours , collecting a total of 5 , 040 L of air from each 82 patient’s room . 83 In the room of Patient 1 , three NIOSH samplers were attached to each of two tripod stands 84 and situated at different heights from the ground ( 1 . 2m , 0 . 9m , and 0 . 7m ) near the air exhaust 85 to capture particles from the unidirectional airflow in the room . Throughout the four - hour 86 sampling period , Patient 1 was intermittently facing the NIOSH samplers while seated one 87 meter from the first tripod and 2 . 1 meters from the second tripod . Four SKC 37mm PTFE 88 filter ( 0 . 3μm pore size ) cassettes were also distributed throughout the room and connected to 89 SKC Universal air sampling pumps set at a flow - rate of 5 L / min , each collecting an 90 additional 1 , 200 L of air from the room . 91 All rights reserved .

Throughout 93 the four - hour sampling period , Patients 2 and 3 remained in bed within 1 meter from all 6 94 NIOSH samplers ( Supplementary Figure 1 ) . Patient 3 was also talking on the phone for a 95 significant proportion of time during sampling . Additional SKC pumps with PTFE filter 96 cassettes were not used in the rooms of Patient 2 and 3 . 97 The 6 NIOSH samples from each room were pooled prior to analysis , but the particle size 98 fractions remained separated . Each sample pool was representative of 5 , 040 L air . 99 Surface sampling 100 Surface samples were collected with Puritan® EnviroMax Plus pre - moistened macrofoam 101 sterile swabs ( 25 - 88060 ) . Eight to 20 surface samples were collected from each room . Five 102 surfaces were designated high - touch surfaces , including the cardiac table , entire length of the 103 bed rails including bed control panel and call bell , bedside locker , electrical switches on top 104 of the beds , and chair in general ward rooms ( Supplemental Figure 1 ) . In ICU rooms , the 105 ventilator and infusion pumps were sampled instead of the electrical switches on top of the 106 beds and chair ( Supplemental Figure 2 ) . Air exhaust outlets and glass window surfaces were 107 sampled in five rooms , including the three rooms in which air sampling was performed . 108 Toilet seat and automatic flush button ( one combined swab ) were sampled in AIIR rooms in 109 the general ward . 110 Sample transfer and processing 111 All samples were immediately stored at 4°C in the hospital prior to transfer to a BSL - 3 112 laboratory where samples were immediately processed and stored at - 80°C unless directly 113 analyzed . Prior to RNA extraction , NIOSH aerosol sample tubes and filters were processed as 114 previously described 7 , with slight modification due to the pooling of samples . 115 All rights reserved .

Real - time PCR assays targeting the envelope ( E ) genes 8 and an in house orf1ab 118 assay were used to detect SARS - CoV - 2 in the samples 9 . All samples were run in duplicate 119 and with both assays . Positive detection was recorded as long as amplification was observed 120 in at least 1 assay . 121 Statistical analysis 122 Statistical analysis was performed using Stata version 15 . 1 ( StataCorp , College Station , 123 Texas ) and GraphPad Prism 8 . 0 ( GraphPad Software , Inc . , San Diego ) . P < 0 . 05 was 124 considered statistically significant , and all tests were 2 - tailed . For the surface environment , 125 outcome measures analyzed were any positivity by room and pooled percentage positivity by 126 day of illness and respiratory viral load ( represented by clinical cycle threshold ( Ct ) value ) . 127 We analyzed the factors associated with environmental contamination using the Student t - 128 test , or the nonparametric Wilcoxon rank - sum test was used for continuous variables 129 depending on their distribution . The χ2 or Fisher exact test was used to compare categorical 130 variables . We plotted the best fit curve by least - square method to study the environmental 131 contamination distribution across various the days of illness and clinical Ct value . 132 Results 133 Environmental sampling was conducted in three AIIRs in the ICU and 27 AIIRs in the 134 general ward . Air sampling was performed in three of the 27 AIIRs in the general ward . All 135 patients reported COVID - 19 symptoms . Seven patients ( 23 % ) were asymptomatic at the time 136 of environmental sampling . Of the 23 symptomatic patients , 18 ( 78 % ) had respiratory 137 symptoms , one had gastrointestinal symptoms , one had both respiratory and gastrointestinal 138 symptoms , and three patients ( 10 % ) had fever or myalgia only ( Supplemental Table 1 ) . 139 All rights reserved .

Total SARS - CoV - 2 concentrations in air 141 ranged from 1 . 84x10 3 to 3 . 38x10 3 RNA copies per m 3 air sampled . Rooms with viral 142 particles detected in the air also had surface contamination detected . 143 There were no baseline differences between patients with environmental surface 144 contamination and those without , in terms of age , comorbidities , and positive clinical sample 145 on the day of sampling . Median cycle threshold ( Ct ) values of the clinical specimens for 146 patients with and without environmental surface contamination were 25 . 69 ( IQR 20 . 37 to 147 34 . 48 ) and 33 . 04 ( 28 . 45 to 35 . 66 ) respectively ( Table 2 ) . 148 Of the rooms with environmental contamination , the floor was most likely to be contaminated 149 ( 65 % ) , followed by the bed rail ( 59 % ) , and bedside locker ( 42 % ) ( Figure 1 ) . Contamination 150 of toilet seat and automatic toilet flush button was detected in five out of 27 rooms , and all 151 five occupants had reported gastrointestinal symptoms within the preceding one week of 152 sampling . We did not detect surface contamination in any of the three ICU rooms . 153 Presence of environmental surface contamination was higher in week 1 of illness ( Figure 2 ) 154 and showed association with the clinical cyclical threshold ( P = 0 . 06 ) . Surface environment 155 contamination was not associated with the presence of symptoms or supplementary oxygen 156 ( Table 2 ) . In a subgroup analysis , the presence and extent of high - touch surface 157 contamination were significantly higher in rooms of patients in their first week of illness 158 ( Figure 2 ) . The best fit curve with the least - squares fit ( Figure 3 ) showed that the extent of 159 high - touch surface contamination declined with increasing duration of illness and Ct values . 160 There was also no correlation between the Ct values of clinical samples and the Ct values of 161 environmental samples across the days of illness ( Supplemental Figure 3 ) . 162 Discussion 163 All rights reserved .

The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted April 9 , 2020 . ; https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1101 / 2020 . 03 . 29 . 20046557 doi : medRxiv preprint 8 Surface sampling revealed that the PCR - positivity high - touch surfaces was associated with 164 nasopharyngeal viral loads and peaked at approximately day four to five of symptoms . Air 165 sampling of the AIIR environments of two COVID - 19 patients ( both day five of illness with 166 high nasopharyngeal swab viral loads ) detected the presence of SARS - CoV - 2 particles sized 167 1 - 4 µm and > 4 µm . The absence of any detection of SARS - CoV - 2 in air samples of the third 168 patient ( day nine of illness with lower nasopharyngeal viral load concentration ) suggests that 169 the presence of SARS - CoV - 2 in the air is possibly highest in the first week of illness . 170 Recent aggregated environmental sampling and laboratory experiments have examined the 171 particle size distribution of SARS - CoV - 2 in the air . A study from Wuhan , China sampled 172 three different environmental settings and detected aerosol size range particles 10 . 173 Additionally , a recent laboratory study demonstrated the ability of SARS - CoV - 2 to remain 174 viable in aerosols for up to 3 hours 11 . While limited in subject numbers , our study examined 175 this issue at the individual patient - level , thus enabling correlation of particle size distribution 176 in the air with symptoms duration and nasopharyngeal viral loads . The absence of aerosol - 177 generating procedures or intranasal oxygen supplementation reduces the possibility of our 178 current findings being iatrogenic in nature . Larger individual patient - level studies examining 179 the droplet and aerosolizing potential of SARS - CoV - 2 over different distances and under 180 different patient and environmental conditions are rapidly needed to determine the 181 generalizability of our current findings . 182 In the current analysis the presence and concentration of SARS - CoV - 2 in air and high - touch 183 surface samples correlated with the day of illness and nasopharyngeal viral loads of COVID - 184 19 patients . This finding is supported by multiple observational clinical studies have 185 demonstrated that SARS - CoV - 2 viral loads peak in the first week among COVID - 19 patients 186 2 , 12 , 13 , with active viral replication in the upper respiratory tract in the first five days of 187 illness 14 .

Another study from Nebraska 193 attempted virus culture on SARS - CoV - 2 PCR - positive air samples , however could not isolate 194 viable virus 15 . The difficulty in culturing virus from air samples arises from low virus 195 concentrations , as well as the compromised integrity of the virus due to air sampling 196 stressors . Future studies using enhanced virus culture techniques could be considered 16 , and 197 efforts to design a culture method to isolate virus from our samples is underway . Second , 198 sampling in an AIIR environment may not be representative of community settings and 199 further work is needed to generalize our current findings . Third , we sampled each room at a 200 single timepoint during the course of illness and did not track environmental contamination 201 over the course of illness for individual patients . Fourth , as clinical results were within 72 202 hours of environmental testing , it is plausible that during the day of testing , viral load was 203 actually low or negligible , hence limiting environmental contamination . 204 Current evidence does not seem to point to aerosolization as the key route of transmission of 205 SARS - CoV - 2 , and there have been reports of healthcare workers not being infected after 206 exposure to confirmed patients despite not using airborne precautions 17 . Detailed 207 epidemiologic studies of outbreaks , in both healthcare and non - healthcare settings , should be 208 carried out to determine the relative contribution of various routes of transmission and their 209 correlation with patient - level factors . 210 In conclusion , in a limited number of AIIR environments , our current study involving 211 individual COVID - 19 patients not undergoing aerosol - generating procedures or oxygen 212 All rights reserved .

Even though particles in this size range have the potential to 214 linger longer in the air , more data on viability and infectiousness of the virus would be 215 required to confirm the potential airborne spread of SARS - CoV - 2 . Additionally , the 216 concentrations of SARS - CoV - 2 in the air and high - touch surfaces could be highest during the 217 first week of COVID - 19 illness . Further work is urgently needed to examine these findings in 218 larger numbers and different settings to better understand the factors affecting air and surface 219 spread of SARS - CoV - 2 and inform effective infection prevention policies . 220 All rights reserved .
