The experiment allows for the comparison between individual and group health utilities measured using the Time Trade - off ( TTO ) and Standard Gamble ( SG ) methods , the latter involving risk and the former being riskless . The results indicate a significant difference between the group and individual health utilities measured using the TTO method , but not the SG method . Furthermore , there is a significant difference between the SG and TTO utilities calculated for the grouped participants , but not the individual subjects . However , when the SG utilities are adjusted for prospect theory , a significant difference is found between the TTO and SG elicited health utilities for the individual participants , but not for the grouped subjects , indicating a reduction in biases is present in the grouped participants for the TTO method , but not when making use of the SG method . 4 Introduction Decision - making within healthcare is an intricate process involving several stakeholders with varying levels of expertise , from the patient themselves to a team of surgeons with different specializations . There is , however , one clearly overarching objective , which is to reduce the discomfort of the patient to a minimal level , especially in case of chronic conditions for which a cure is not possible . Although the patientsâ€™ care is the number one priority , cost effectiveness must also be considered when assessing different health policies . In order to reach both goals from a more standardized point of view , it is first necessary to calculate and evaluate the utility of the specific health state in the patientâ€™s mind . Although this is a personal preference , there is a lot of information that a medical professional provides that will have a large effect on the evaluation of the health state . Furthermore , it is virtually impossible for an individual to make a decision concerning their health without an active discussion with their medical professional , or without gaining the opinion of family members or friends , especially when referring to chronic medical conditions . Thus it is illogical to measure health utilities on which medical decisions are assessed through isolated questionnaires , given that there are significant biases that affect individual decision - making . In order to gain a more realistic indication of the value assigned to a specific health state , a different approach should be taken that includes a collaborative method . The challenge surrounding medical decision - making is the wide variety of cases , and the high variation even between cases with the same diagnosis . In the proposed study , the focus will lie primarily on the comparison between a decision made by an individual compared to one made in a pair , concerning a strictly defined health state to avoid further confusion . In order to define shared decision - making , several criteria must be met . These include the involvement of at least two participants , participation towards a shared decision by both , information sharing , and agreement on the final decision ( Charles et al . , 1997 ) . Thus , the terms paired decision - making and group decision - making will be used interchangeably throughout this paper . The following literature review will outline the current methods used to elicit health utilities , the biases that arise from making use of these methods , and the strengthening of decision making through group cooperation . 5 Health Utilities Firstly , it is important to understand what health utilities are , how they are measured and how they are used in medical decision - making . Health utilities are values customarily between 1 . 0 ( healthy state ) and 0 . 0 ( death state ) that indicate the strength of individualsâ€™ preferences for certain health related outcomes ( Torrance , 1986 ) . More specifically , health utility assessment is the process of assigning a quality weight to a specific health state , which then plays an important role in cost - effectiveness analysis ( Doctor , Bleichrodt & Lin , 2010 ) . One of the leading methods makes use of utility theory , and the preferences are thus considered utilities due to the fact that they are measured under uncertainty , whereas other methods determine values provided under certainty , eliminating the individualâ€™s risk attitude ( Torrance , Furlong & Feeny , 2002 ) . The three most common direct measures of health utility include the standard gamble ( SG ) , the time trade - off ( TTO ) , and the visual analog scale ( VAS ) . For the purpose of this research , the visual analog scale will not be covered in depth since it does not require that the subjects make a trade - off ( choice ) between different arguments , and thus is viewed by economists as inferior to the SG and TTO methods ( Dolan , 2000 ) . Furthermore , the SG and TTO methods are suitable for a variety of applications , including cost - utility analysis , quality adjusted life years ( QALYs ) and monitoring the health of a population ( Torrance , Furlong & Feeny , 2002 ) . The QALY model takes into account both the quality ( health state utility ) and quantity of life generated by a healthcare intervention , and is thus a measure of health effectiveness to be included in cost - effectiveness analysis ( Weinstein , Torrance & McGuire , 2009 ) . Given that health has a large influence on oneâ€™s utility function , both methods are founded on the principle that it is possible to measure the welfare change associated with a change in health , if the compensating change in another factor in the utility function can be determined ( Dolan , 2002 ) . The methods can be seen as sharing a common theoretical background if it is assumed that improvements in health are a negative function of risk for the SG , and a positive function of longevity for the TTO method ( Dolan , 2002 ) . 6 Standard Gamble Method There are many possible variations of the SG method , the essence being that a subject must make a choice between two alternatives . The first maintains a chronic health state ( X ) with certainty for T years , while the second offers the probability p of living in full health ( FH ) for T years and probability 1 - p of death immediately . By varying the value of p until the subject is indifferent between the two alternatives we uncover the health utility U ( X ) = p ( Torrance , 1986 ) . The probability p indicates the point of indifference between the certain chronic state ( X ) and said probability of living in full health . When this indifference is evaluated by expected utility theory the following is obtained : U ( T years in health state X ) = p U ( T years in FH ) + ( 1 - p ) U ( death ) Thus given the scaling of U ( T years in FH ) = 1 and U ( death ) = 0 , the resulting utility of the chronic health state is U ( X ) = p . Time Trade - off Method Alternatively , the TTO method involves a tradeoff between living with a chronic condition , and living for a shorter time at full health . As can be seen in the figure below , the subject must make a decision between state X ( chronic health state preferred to death ) for T 1 years , and full health ( FH ) for T 2 years ( T 2 < T 1 ) . In this case T 2 is varied until the subject is indifferent between the alternatives . Finally , the specific health state utility is 7 computed by U ( X ) = T 2 / T 1 given that the utility is linear in duration ( Torrance , 1986 ) . This implies that giving up years of life now rather than later will have an equal effect on an individualâ€™s utility , since each year of life yields the same utility ( Dolan & Jones - Lee , 1997 ) . This assumption will be discussed in depth in the following section . The two methods outlined above are those most commonly used . However , they often provide different quality weights to the same given health state ( Krabbe , Essink - Bot & Bonsel , 1997 ) . A summary of the necessary notation for both methods can be found in Appendix A . 1 . 8 Health Utility Biases Although the methods described above are standardized methods that have been used for many years , they are not immune to human biases . This is apparent from the differing results obtained from the different methods while measuring the utility of the same health state ( Hornberger , Redelmeier & Petersen , 1992 ) . Biases are the result of making use of heuristics in order to simplify tasks , leading to systematic error ( Tversky & Kahneman , 1974 ) . Essentially , these biases stem from violations of expected utility , and the three identified as leading to systematic error in either the SG or TTO methods include , probability weighting , loss aversion , and scale compatibility ( Bleichrodt , 2002 ) . Utility curvature was also identified as affecting the elicited health utilities using the TTO method , but stems from the violation of assumption of linear duration rather than a violation of expected utility . For the purpose of this study , the focus will lie on the difference in health utilities obtained through the SG and TTO . The latter has consistently been proven to elicit lower individual quality weights than the SG method through a number of empirical studies ( Torrance , 1976 ) . In order to understand this difference in results , it is important to consider the systematic error effects mentioned above . A previous study by Bleichrodt determined the effect of each bias on the utilities elicited through the SG and TTO methods , as can be seen in the table below ( 2002 ) . Each one will be covered individually in the following sections , addressing the reason for the direction of the bias . 1 1 Overview of the biases in the SG and TTO utilities ( Bleichrodt , 2002 ) 9 Utility Curvature The first effect discussed is only relevant for the TTO method since there is an assumption of linear utility in duration , which is not the case in the standard gamble . This assumption of linear utility for duration leads to downward bias in TTO utilities , given a concave utility function over duration . This is due to the fact that for most people the marginal utilities for length of life vary from year to year , increasing more rapidly in the short term compared to long term ( Stiggelbout et al . , 1994 ) . In laymanâ€™s terms , people are more concerned with their short - term health than long - term health , and will act accordingly when making decisions concerning their well - being . Dolan and Jones - Lee indicate that a participant completing a TTO task will be more willing to sacrifice more years in the future rather than years of life now , thus having a positive rate of time preference and a concave utility function over duration , as seen below ( 1997 ) . This downward bias is thus intensified in utility measurement concerning oneâ€™s health in the short - term , leading to higher inaccuracy in the elicitation . 2 2 Concave utility function indicates the downward biased TTO utilities ( Bleichrodt , 2002 ) 10 Probability Weighting This bias , on the other hand , does not affect the TTO method since there are no probabilities involved . Therefore , the focus lies on the SG method and the probabilities this method relies on . Expected utility assumes that people evaluate probabilities in a linear fashion . However , this is not the case and there is a vast amount of empirical evidence indicating that people assign weights to different probabilities , and these are demonstrated by an inverse S - shaped probability weighting function as seen below ( Tversky & Kahneman , 1992 ) . One non - expected utility theory that allows for the non - linear weighting of probabilities is rank - dependent utility ( RDU ) theory , and does so by creating a decision weight ( w ) of an outcome that is a function of the probability of the outcome along with its rank compared to the other outcomes ( Bleichrodt , van Rijn & Johannesson , 1999 ) . Thus under RDU , the SG utility of health state X becomes as follows : U ( T years in health state X ) = w ( p ) U ( T years in FH ) + w ( 1 - p ) U ( death ) Thus given the scaling of U ( T years in FH ) = 1 and U ( death ) = 0 , the resulting utility of the chronic health state becomes U ( X ) = w ( p ) . The point at which the probability weighting function switches from concave to convex occurs between . 3 and . 4 , leading to an upward bias given that w ( p ) < p and the probabilities are thus underweighted . Since the standard gamble method used in this study only presents options with percentages greater than . 5 , the focus lies on the upper half of the probability weighting function . The health utilities elicited through the SG method are thus overstated due to the underweighting of larger probabilities . 11 3 Loss Aversion One of the more familiar deviations from expected utility introduced by Tversky and Kahneman is the evaluation of outcomes relative to a reference point with a higher sensitivity to losses than to gains known as loss aversion ( 1979 ) . It is logical that a bias such as loss aversion would play a role in decisions concerning oneâ€™s health and duration of life , given the high value assigned to oneâ€™s own life . In the following sections the reference points used in both methods will be explored . In the time trade - off method , the participant must indicate how many years in full health ( T 2 ) will make him indifferent to a given number of years ( T 1 ) in a chronic health state . Loss aversion implies that one will take T 1 as a reference point , and be less willing to give up years of life in order to gain health status , thus creating an upward bias in the TTO elicited health utilities . However , as Bleichrodt ( 2002 ) points out , this effect is reversed by framing the question differently . If an individual is asked to give up health to gain years on their life , this effect will be reversed and the TTO utilities will be biased 3 Probability weighting function for gains ( w + ) and losses ( w - ) ( Tversky & Kahneman , 1992 ) 12 downwards . In that situation , the reference point becomes the state of full health , and a subject will be less willing to give up what they already perceive to have . In the standard gamble method , the certain chronic health state ( X ) is the reference point when it comes to evaluating the options presented . The choice presented to the subject is thus the decision between T years in a chronic health state versus the probability ( p ) of living the same number of years in full health , with probability ( 1 - p ) of immediate death . Given that the reference point taken will be the certain option ( T years in a chronic health state ) , a higher probability ( p ) of living in full health will be necessary for a loss averse subject to renounce the certainty of the other option . This can be attributed to the fact that the loss of years of life has a greater impact than the gain in overall health , and thus a higher chance of full health is necessary to offset the loss of certainty . This behavior indicates a systematic upward bias in the health utility elicited through the SG method in case of loss aversion . 13 Scale Compatibility The final effect addresses the violation of procedural invariance , which is the assumption that people have a well - defined utility function leading them to provide the same preference ordering through different elicitation techniques ( Tversky , Sattath & Slovic , 1988 ) . DelquiÃ¨ ( 1993 ) proved that this assumption is systematically violated , triggering research to determine various explanations . Scale compatibility provides an explanation for the violation of procedural invariance by demonstrating that oneâ€™s preferences are dependent on the response scale used and an individual attaches more weight to an attribute given its higher compatibility with the response scale used . Given that the response scale used in the TTO method is in years , scale compatibility indicates that the subject will place more weight on the information provided concerning duration rather than health status . Therefore , with the focus laying on duration , the participant will be less willing to give up years for an improvement in health status , leading to an upward bias in the elicited health utilities . Alternatively , the response scale used in the SG method is probability , shifting the subjectsâ€™ weight to those provided . However , the direction of this bias is not clearly defined , since it is impossible to determine whether a participant will put more weight on the probability of full health ( p ) , the probability of death ( 1 - p ) that are provided , or the certainty ( p = 1 ) of the certain option . The direction of this bias on health utilities elicited using the SG method is ambiguous , since which probability the subject focuses on will lead to opposite effects on the health utilities ( Bleichrodt , 2002 ) . 14 Group decision - making Group decisions play a large role in everyday life and it is common for people to consult with others , expert or not , in order to make a difficult decision . Therefore , it is logical that this would be especially present in the case of medical decision - making , given the high value people assign to their overall well - being and the complexity that such decisions involve . A large body of research can be found concerning the performance of groups compared to individuals , with varying results for different types of tasks . Pagliari et . al . defined the group decision making process into 3 separate stages of orientation , evaluation and control ( 2001 ) . The first involves the group members defining the problem at hand . They must then evaluate the options , which is where the most discussion takes place , and finally come to an agreement concerning the alternative to select . Within these three stages the group is susceptible to social influences from one another , which can lead to biases associated with group dynamics . It is not common for an individual to make decisions concerning their health without further discussion with a medical professional or friends and family , meaning that external players influence their decisions positively or negatively . For example , certain motivation losses are associated with group decision - making , commonly known as social loafing ( Kerr & Tindale , 2004 ) . This refers to the reduced effort of certain members , given the reduced risk of evaluation and opportunity to rely on others to complete the work . However , social loafing is moderated by high task involvement , thus less common in smaller groups with high engagement ( Smith , Kerr , Markus & Stasson , 2001 ) . For the purpose of this research , we will explore whether group decision - making intensifies the biases found in individual decision - making . Kerr , Kramer and MacCoun investigated the bias they denote as Sin of Omission , which refers to the effect of framing in terms of gains or losses on oneâ€™s decision ( 1996 ) . Although mixed results were found , there was stronger evidence to the reduction of the bias through group collaboration . Furthermore , it was found that , on average , groups outperform individuals on various decision - making tasks ( Kerr , MacCoun & Kramer , 1996 ) . 15 Charness , Karni and Levin explored how moving away from the unrealistic laboratory environment , where decisions are made in isolation , affects the rationality of the decisions made ( 2007 ) . To this end , they studied the hypothesis that decisions made by groups are more likely to be to be correct compared to individual decision makers . The results indicate that violations of stochastic dominance and Bayesian updating are reduced through social interaction , and decrease with the growing size of the group ( Charness , Karni & Levin , 2007 ) . Charness and Sutter also studied the evidence that groups have a higher chance of making rational decisions , following standard game - theoretic predictions , compared to individuals who are more affected by social considerations , cognitive limitations and biases ( 2012 ) . This can be attributed to different factors , such as the reduced effect of bounded rationality and increased self - interest behavior found in groups . Another aspect to consider in relation to the SG method is the comparative risk attitude of groups and individuals . The empirical studies comparing decision - making under risk for groups and individuals have thus far found mixed results . Rockenbach , Sadrieh & Mathauschek ( 2007 ) found that there is little difference in the rates of violation of expected utility between groups and individuals . There is also evidence supporting both claims that groups are less risk averse than individuals ( Zhang & Casari , 2009 ) , and more risk averse than individuals when high levels of risk were involved ( Shupp & Williams , 2008 ) . Furthermore , other studies found no differences between the risk attitudes of groups and individuals ( Harrison et al . , 2013 ) . There is currently no literature addressing group decision - making directly in relation to health utility measurement . Therefore , the combination of the research on systematic biases present in health utility measurement and the evidence supporting group decision - making , leads to the following experiment exploring the reduction of systematic biases in health utility measurement through group decision - making . The possibility that performing SG and TTO tasks in a group will result in the reduction of systematic biases found in individualsâ€™ preferences will be studied . 16 Methodology The literature indicates an overall mixed opinion on the benefits of group decision - making due to the wide variety of situations examined , especially in decisions involving risk . However , the research addressing the reduction of biases through group decision - making and the nature of the collaboration necessary in this experiment leads me to the following hypothesis : H 1 : The grouped subjects will demonstrate a reduced difference between the SG and TTO utilities compared to the individual subjects . In order to measure the difference in bias through group decision - making , an experiment was conducted involving one group of individual participants and one group of pairs . These groups were given the same tasks , an SG and TTO task to determine their indifference points , and from that measure their health utilities for the given health state . According to Torrance ( 1986 ) , this process requires 4 steps , namely : 1 ) Health state identification The health state that was used for both the SG and TTO methods is the EQ - 5D 22122 , which describes a state of chronic moderate back pain . This health state was chosen since it is not an uncommon ailment and subjects can therefore relate to the symptoms . More importantly was the time in years ( also known as gauge duration ) that the subjects would be affected by this ailment , since this can affect their decision greatly . As found by Bleichrodt , Pinto , and Abellan - PerpiÃ±an , the inconsistencies found in the TTO method due to loss aversion decrease with a higher gauge duration , and TTO exceeded SG utilities only when short gauge times were used ( 2003 ) . Therefore , in this experiment 24 years was chosen as the gauge duration for both tasks , given that the subjects are students , and could find it challenging to realistically judge much longer gauge times . 17 2 ) Health state description The description of the EQ - 5D 22122 health state is and was presented as follows : ï‚· Some problems walking about ï‚· Some problems performing self - care activities ï‚· No problems performing usual activities ï‚· Moderate pain or discomfort No further information was given concerning the health state , and the participants were instructed to imagine they were currently living in this health state . The description is intended to have a functional focus , rather than providing the clinical details of the health state , as described by a physician ( Torrance , 1986 ) . This specificity allows for the subjects to judge the health state without room for their own interpretation or confusion due to uncommon medical terms . 3 ) Subject selection and Incentives The 64 subjects selected were students of Erasmus University Rotterdam , recruited in person at university or invited to participate via means of social media . All participants were given the option to qualify for the chance of winning a 20â‚¬ Bol . com gift card as an incentive to participate by providing their e - mail address after having completed the tasks . Those completing the two tasks in a group were recruited in person at the university , thus ensuring that the members of a group knew one another beforehand . This was done purposefully in order to enable a certain level of discussion that may not occur between strangers . 4 ) Use of utility measuring instruments As discussed previously in detail , the instruments used are two choice lists presented in a table , one making use of the SG method and the other of the TTO method . The forms given to the subjects can be found in Appendix B . In the time trade - off method , the choices given involve durations that are not multiples of 5 , since subjects are more likely to choose round numbers over non - round numbers ( Bleichrodt , Pinto & 18 Abellan - PerpiÃ±an , 2003 ) . On the other hand , the SG method presents probabilities in round numbers at equal distances , since it can be harder to process percentages . Procedure After the students had agreed to participate , they were instructed on the choice list method used and the pairs were explicitly told that they should discuss the decision before filling out the form . Finally , they were left to complete the task on paper , which was then picked up once they had finished . Due to time limitations and lack of willing subjects present at the university during the summer holidays , the individual participants filled out the exact same form , but through an online questionnaire tool . They were incentivized through the same offer of a chance to win a 20â‚¬ Bol . com gift card by providing their e - mail address at the end of the two tasks . The forms shown were identical , whether administered online through Qualtrics or in paper form , thus the content did not affect their responses . Furthermore , Ross et al . developed a Paper Standard Gamble ( PSG ) questionnaire that would be simple to administer , and found no difference between the SG and PSG methods , concluding PSG to be a reliable substitute for the standard SG method ( 2003 ) . Statistical Methods In order to test the hypothesis , H 1 : The grouped subjects will demonstrate a reduced difference between the SG and TTO utilities compared to the individual subjects , it was firstly necessary to calculate the individual health utilities from the switching points indicated by the subjects for each method . From a quick glance at the table below summarizing the average health utilities indicated per method and group , the SG method appears to have a higher average compared to the TTO , and the individual subjectsâ€™ average health utility appears higher . In the following section the statistical tests used will be discussed to determine the significance of these differences . Due to the unknown distribution of the populations , non - parametric tests were chosen to analyze the data . 19 Between Subject Analysis Firstly , two Mann - Whitney U tests were performed to determine whether there was a significant difference between methods for groups and individuals ( Appendix C1 . 1 ) . There was a significant difference between the health utilities elicited using the TTO methods for groups and individual participants , at a 1 % significance level with p = 0 . 0001 . However , this was not present in the SG health utilities , where the resulting p - value was 0 . 4824 . In fact , there was essentially no difference between the two groups for the SG method , indicating that the upward biases were not removed through executing the task in collaboration with another person . This result indicates that the upward biases in the TTO method caused by loss aversion and scale compatibility were likely reduced through discussing the choice with another person . Within Subject Analysis A Wilcoxon test was performed to assess whether there was a significant difference within groups , thus whether the individual participantsâ€™ SG health utilities were significantly different from their TTO health utilities , and similarly for the grouped participants . The results found in Appendix C1 . 2 indicate that the grouped participants demonstrated significantly different health utilities elicited using the two different methods at a 1 % significance level , with p = 0 . 000 . The individual participants , on the other hand , resulted in a p - value of 0 . 1570 and thus did not show a significant difference . These results are contrary to the hypothesis , given the expectation that the difference would be greater in the individual participants , whereas this indicates that the opposite is true . However , as Average HU Standard Gamble Time Trade - off Individual 0 . 875 0 . 8479 Group 0 . 8318 0 . 5777 20 expected from the available literature ( Torrance , 1976 ) , the SG utilities were higher than the TTO elicited for both groups and individuals . In order to test the hypothesis more precisely , a Mann - Whitney U test was performed on hu _ diff , indicating the difference between SG utilities and TTO utilities , with grouping variable individual , that specifies whether the participants completed the task alone ( 1 ) or in a pair ( 0 ) . The output indicates that there is in fact a statistically significant difference between SG and TTO for the pairs and individuals at a 1 % significance level , with p = 0 . 000 . Furthermore , from the resulting rank sums , it is apparent that the group difference is significantly higher than the individual difference , contrary to the prediction . Adjusted SG Utility Analysis Due to the findings in literature indicate that the SG method health utilities are consistently biased upwards , adjusted SG utilities were calculated in accordance with prospect theory . Kahneman and developed this alternative to the expected utility model for decision - making under risk in which probabilities are replaced by decision weights , given the systematic violation of expected utility axioms ( 1979 ) . Bleichrodt , Pinto and Wakker explored the use of prospect theory to correct for the common violations of expected utility under risk and uncertainty ( 2001 ) . In order to quantify these adjustments , two deviations from expected utility were assumed , namely the non - linear weighting of probabilities and the tendency to assign more weight to gains than losses , known as loss aversion . The resulting corrected probability equivalent utilities that were used to adjust the SG health utilities can be found in Appendix C . 2 , and the average adjusted SG utilities are presented below . Average HU Standard Gamble Time Trade - off Adjusted SG Individual 0 . 875 0 . 8479 0 . 6627 Group 0 . 8318 0 . 5777 0 . 6195 21 The average adjusted SG utilities are clearly much lower than the non - adjusted values , and for the individuals the average is lower than that of the individual TTO utilities . This difference indicates that the upward biases found using the SG method were not reduced through group decision - making , as they were with the TTO utilities . The significance of the difference between the adjusted SG utilities is explored below for both individuals and grouped participants . The interesting result obtained from adjusting the SG utilities according to prospect theory is the reversal of the significant differences previously found . Where before being adjusted the difference between the group SG and TTO was statistically significant , it now results in no significant difference ( p = 0 . 2484 ) . This indicates that the group collaboration reduced the TTO elicited health utilities in the same way as the adjustment for prospect theory did the SG utilities . The differences between individual health utilities were previously found to be non - significant , whereas the prospect theory adjusted SG health utilities are significantly difference from the TTO utilities at a 1 % significance level , with p = 0 . 0003 . 22 Results Whether we consider the SG health utilities adjusted for prospect theory or not , there is not a significant difference between the values elicited for individuals or grouped participants . This indicates that the biases present in the SG elicitation procedure were not eliminated or reduced through group collaboration . This is also apparent when comparing the SG utilities to those adjusted for prospect theory , since there is a strong upward bias in the original values elicited , for both the individuals and grouped participants . The table below provides an overview of the statistical tests performed and those that were found to be significant at a 1 % significance level . The fact that there is not a significant difference between the group TTO utilities and the adjusted SG values , along with the significant difference between the same values for the individual participants , indicates that the collaboration led to a reduction of biases in the TTO method . Since both methods are known to lead to utilities with an upward bias in individual participants ( Torrance , 1976 ) , the fact that the grouped TTO was much lower is in line with the expectations stated in the hypothesis , unlike the SG health utilities . It is likely that the nature of the methods is responsible for the difference in the results . The SG method involves risk and the percentages represent this risk for each option . This can have an effect on the benefit of collaboration , since people can have very different risk attitudes . If one member is more risk averse , it will be much harder to convince them Test Sample 1 Sample 2 Significant at 1 % Ranksum SGg SGi No Ranksum TTOg TTOi Yes Wilcoxon signed - rank SGg TTOg Yes Wilcoxon signed - rank SGi TTOi No Wilcoxon signed - rank TTOg Corrected SGg No Wilcoxon signed - rank TTOi Corrected SGi Yes 23 to take a more risky option regarding their own well - being , compared with the opposite situation , especially since groups are known to be more risk averse than individuals when confronted with high levels of risk ( Shupp & Williams , 2008 ) . Even if one subject is generally more risk seeking , it is simpler to convince someone to select an option that will protect his or her own well - being . Furthermore , previous studies have found little evidence that group decision making under risk leads to greater compliance with expected utility theory ( Rockenbach , Sadrieh & Mathauschek , 2007 ) . Bone et al . also demonstrated that groups and individuals had similar rates of violation of expected utility when making decisions under risk ( 1999 ) . In the TTO method , on the other hand , there is not a risk factor but simply a decision based on certain outcomes . This situation could enable more discussion , leading to the results seen above of reduced biases in the group setting . 24 Conclusion The field of medical decision - making and group decision - making are developed fields that each provide a large amount of information , yet the link between the two fields has purely addressed the psychological effects of groups acting in a medical setting . With this experiment , I explored the effect of group decision - making specifically on the measurement of health utilities , in order to provide further insight into the reduction of specific biases through collaboration . The initial results were ambiguous , indicating a significant reduction through the riskless TTO method , but a lack of a significant effect through the SG method involving risk . The contrast between the elicited SG utilities before and after the adjustment according to prospect theory indicates how greatly the original values are biased upwards . It also allows for a more reliable comparison between the SG and TTO elicited utilities , although the latter are also highly inflated in the individual subjects . It is apparent that the biases found using the TTO method are highly reduced through a group decision - making process , supporting the initial hypothesis . From comparing the two elicitation methods , the significant difference between the adjusted individual SG utilities and the individual TTO values represents the highly biased nature of the latter . Furthermore , the fact that these health utilities are not significantly different for the grouped participants indicates that the grouped TTO method does in fact reduce the biases present , while the ( unadjusted ) SG method does not . A possible explanation concerning the group TTO method reducing biases present and the group SG method not is that the former is much simpler for participants to understand . The probabilities involved in the SG elicitation method could create more confusion amongst participants . Furthermore , in a group it is likely that different members have different risk attitudes , and it is generally less challenging to convince someone to be more loss averse rather than less , leading to the same biases present in the individual participantsâ€™ health utilities . It is also possible for the participants to have differing time preferences that could affect their responses in the TTO method . However 25 Sozou and Seymour provide evidence that a U - shaped relationship exists between age and time preference ( 2003 ) , thus leading to believe that this would not have a large effect on the results given that the participants fall within the same age range . Limitations One clear limitation of this study was the setting in which the participants were asked to complete the task . Due to limited resources , it was not possible to measure the health utilities in a lab setting , thus allowing for the distraction of the participants . Furthermore , since the groups were approached while already sitting together , it is very likely that the group members knew each other already . This could lead to a higher level of trust between them and therefore influence their decisions accordingly . Another factor that could have influenced the results is the fact that the individual participants completed the task online , meaning the setting was most likely different than for the groups as university . Although the task was identical and there is evidence supporting the equality of the results obtained through online and paper methods , the vocal instructions provided to the grouped participants could have led to a difference in their overall understanding of the task ( Ross et al . , 2003 ) . It would also have been beneficial to sample a larger number of participants in order to gain a more representative result and increase the power of the tests . More importantly , the number of subjects in one group performing the task was always two . Increasing this number to 3 or more could have influenced the group dynamics and affected the results as well , since violations of stochastic dominance and Bayesian updating are reduced through social interaction , and decrease with the growing size of the group ( Charness , Karni & Levin , 2007 ) . However , a larger group presents more biases associated with group dynamics , which could lead to various effects on the results . Furthermore , it would have been interesting to have the participants complete the tasks individually as well as in a group to control for between subject confounding effects . 26 Suggestions for Future Research In previous studies by Charness , Karni and Levin ( 2007 ) , the biases associated with individual decision - making were found to decrease with group size . Therefore , it would be highly beneficial to conduct this experiment in a controlled environment with groups formed by three or more participants . Given the results from the comparison of SG and TTO health utilities , a study about the ease of persuasion to taking a more risk averse attitude would be informative to determine what lead to the difference in group decision - making . It is logical that people are more easily convinced in a social setting to take a more risk averse stance , given that the decisions affects others , not only their own well - being ( Zhang & Casari , 2009 ) . An individual will not feel entitled to push others to select a more risky option since the outcome will have a more widespread effect in case of a negative outcome . Another adjustment that could improve the validity of the study would be to create a medical setting in which the subjects would complete the task . Given that health utilities are being elicited , it would be interesting to explore the effect of the presence of a medical professional on the resulting health utilities . Lastly , the results of this study address only one chronic health state with consequences that are not extremely dire for the patient . It is recommended to explore the effect of group decision - making on health utility elicitation in different settings and with a range of health states to gain a more reliable insight into its effect on the resulting utilities . 27 References Bleichrodt , H .
