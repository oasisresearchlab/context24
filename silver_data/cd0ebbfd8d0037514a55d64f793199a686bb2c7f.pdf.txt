Different subjective methodologies ex - ist , from direct rating with single or double stimuli to indirect rating with pairwise comparisons . Triplet and quadruplet - based comparisons are a type of indirect rating . From these compar - isons and preferences on stimuli , we can place the assessed stimuli on a perceptual scale ( e . g . , from low to high quality ) . Maximum Likelihood Difference Scaling ( MLDS ) solver is one of these al - gorithms working with triplets and quadruplets . A participant is asked to compare intervals inside pairs of stimuli : ( a , b ) and ( c , d ) , where a , b , c , d are stimuli forming a quadruplet . However , one limitation is that the perceptual scales retrieved from stim - uli of different contents are usually not comparable . We previ - ously offered a solution to measure the inter - content scale of mul - tiple contents . This paper presents an open - source python im - plementation of the method and demonstrates its use on three datasets collected in an in - lab environment . We compared the ac - curacy and effectiveness of the method using pairwise , triplet , and quadruplet for intra - content annotations .

They are necessary to benchmark objective quality metrics and to create datasets to train machine learning and deep learning models . However , running an in - lab or crowdsourced subjective experi - ment is time - consuming and expensive . Furthermore , due to the subjectivity of the stimuli and the task of annotating them , there is not always an agreement in people’s judgment . Accurate estima - tions are needed to reduce noise and uncertainty in collected data . It is then critical to select the most suited subjective methodology to boost and allocate the annotation resources to the right set of stimuli . Multiple methodologies exist to rate stimuli , with direct esti - mation like Absolute Category Rating ( ACR ) or Double Stimuli Impairment Scale ( DSIS ) . Indirect methods are , for example , two - Alternative Forced Choice ( 2AFC ) or pairwise comparison ( PC ) . PC is more reliable since observers only need to provide their prefer - ence on a pair , and comparisons are more sensitive . It improves the discriminability between stimuli . PC experiments generate matrices of values indicating how often a stimulus has been preferred over another . These Pair Compari - son matrices ( PCM ) are transformed to a continuous scale , using models ( e . g . , Thurstone [ 18 ] , Bradley and Terry [ 1 ] , Tversky [ 19 ] ) . Due to the pairwise manner of presenting stimuli , the PCM size and the number of possible comparisons grow quadratically with the number of stimuli , introducing efficiency in a subjective proto - col . A lot of previous works focused on active - sampling solutions [ 2 , 4 , 6 , 7 , 16 , 22 ] and more recently [ 8 , 10 , 11 , 17 , 21 ] to select the most informative pairs and minimize experimental effort while maintaining accurate estimations and robustness to bad annotator behavior ( e . g . , spammers ) . In this paper , we focus on providing an understanding of the code we make open - source on GitHub as an extension to the Maximum Likelihood Difference Scaling ( MLDS ) methodology [ 5 , 9 ] . MLDS estimates how pre - ordered stimuli are perceived with comparisons of supra - threshold perceptual differences . The stimuli are generated from a reference stimulus with an increasing alter - ation process ( e . g . , encoding , color - grading , rotation ) . We have a perceptual scale per set of stimuli and lack a global scale where all sets of stimuli can be represented . In [ 15 ] , we presented an ap - proach to address this limitation and validate it through simulated annotations . In this work , three datasets of annotations using quadruplets , triplets , or pairwise comparisons are made available . They are col - lected from participants in an in - lab subjective experiment over 458 MMSys ’23 , June 7 – 10 , 2023 , Vancouver , BC , Canada Pastor , et al . small video patches to estimate the local distortions in videos . We provided an analysis and a comparison of the accuracy of the esti - mates retrieved from these three experiments . Figure 1 : Example of quadruplets that an observer needs to rate . The task is to judge where he perceives a greater difference between the top pair of patches and the bottom pair . 2 MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD DIFFERENCE SCALING In this section , we present the MLDS methodology [ 5 , 9 ] and the extension we introduced in [ 15 ] to estimate an inter - content scaling for cross - content perception comparison . A content 𝐶 𝑖 has a reference stimulus 𝑆 𝑖 1 and 𝑛 − 1 modified ver - sions ofit undertest : 𝑆 𝑖 2 , . . . , 𝑆 𝑖𝑛 . This setof stimuli 𝐶 𝑖 = { 𝑆 𝑖 1 , 𝑆 𝑖 2 , . . . , 𝑆 𝑖𝑛 } is pre - ordered along a physical continuum , with the assumption that larger alterations introduce higher perceptual differences : 𝑆 𝑖 1 < 𝑆 𝑖 2 < . . . < 𝑆 𝑖𝑛 ( 1 ) Duringeachtrialofthesubjective test , aquadruplet ( 𝑆 𝑖 , 𝑆 𝑗 , 𝑆 𝑘 , 𝑆 𝑙 ) is presented to the observer ; see figure 1 for an example . In return , the observer needs to estimate where he perceives a greater dis - tance between the pair ( 𝑆 𝑖 , 𝑆 𝑗 ) or ( 𝑆 𝑘 , 𝑆 𝑙 ) . A trial outcome is 0 or 1 , corresponding to the following judgment : (cid:12)(cid:12) 𝑆 𝑖 − 𝑆 𝑗 (cid:12)(cid:12) − | 𝑆 𝑘 − 𝑆 𝑙 | > 0 . ( 2 ) During solving , MLDS estimates scalar values ( 𝜙 𝑖 1 , . . . , 𝜙 𝑖𝑛 ) to fit to the observer judgments . 2 . 1 Intra - content difference scaling Judgments of observers can be interpreted as a system of linear equations , with the assumption introduced in the previous section : larger alterations on the reference stimulus present higher percep - tual differences . This system can be solved with a General Linear Model ( GLM ) using a link function 𝜂 = 𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑖𝑡 ( 𝜋 ( 𝑥 ) ) or 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑏𝑖𝑡 ( 𝜋 ( 𝑥 ) ) where 𝜋 ( 𝑥 ) is P ( 𝑌 = 1 | 𝑋 1 = 𝑥 1 , . . . , 𝑋 𝑛 = 𝑥 𝑛 ) and , 𝜋 ( 𝑥 ) = 𝐹 ( 𝜙 1 𝑋 1 + 𝜙 2 𝑋 2 + . . . + 𝜙 𝑛 𝑋 𝑛 ) , ( 3 ) where F is the inverse of the link function 𝜂 . Maximum Likeli - hood Estimation ( MLE ) can also be used for solving , more detail in [ 5 , 9 ] . We provide in our software an implementation of the MLE version and adapt it for inter - content scaling . We give an example for 5 quadruplets on 7 stimuli ( 1 - 7 ) from a content 𝐶 𝑖 . Each line describes a quadruplet and stimuli potentially presented to an observer : (cid:169)(cid:173)(cid:173)(cid:173)(cid:173)(cid:173) (cid:171) 2 4 5 6 1 2 3 7 1 5 6 7 1 2 4 6 3 5 6 7 (cid:170)(cid:174)(cid:174)(cid:174)(cid:174)(cid:174) (cid:172) ( 4 ) yield the following matrix used in the software solver , 𝑋 = (cid:169)(cid:173)(cid:173)(cid:173) (cid:173) (cid:173) (cid:171) 0 1 0 − 1 − 1 1 0 1 − 1 − 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 − 1 − 1 1 1 − 1 0 − 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 − 1 − 1 1 (cid:170)(cid:174)(cid:174)(cid:174) (cid:174) (cid:174) (cid:172) ( 5 ) This matrix X allows estimating the ( 𝜙 𝑖 1 , . . . , 𝜙 𝑖𝑛 ) for 𝐶 𝑖 and then be plotted as a perceptual curve . ( e . g . each line in fig . 2 corresponds to the 𝜙 𝑖 of a 𝐶 𝑖 ) . 2 . 2 Inter - contents difference scaling In the previous section , we introduced the MLDS method and how to estimate perceptual differences from a set of stimuli of a content 𝐶 𝑖 . However , with this method , the scaling inter - content is not retrieved . In other words , we are missing how stimuli from a content 𝐶 𝑖 are perceived differently than those from a content 𝐶 𝑗 . We added inter - content comparisons to estimate a scaling fac - tor for each perceptual curve ( reminder : one perceptual curve per content ) . Here , a quadruplet is composed of a pair of stimuli from a first content 𝐶 𝑖 and a pair from a second content 𝐶 𝑗 : ( 𝑆 𝑖𝑎 , 𝑆 𝑖𝑏 , 𝑆 𝑗𝑐 , 𝑆 𝑗𝑑 ) . The observer is asked , similarly as in intra - content comparison , to judge where he perceives a significantly larger perceptual distance : (cid:12)(cid:12) 𝑆 𝑖𝑎 − 𝑆 𝑖𝑏 (cid:12)(cid:12) − (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) 𝑆 𝑗𝑐 − 𝑆 𝑗𝑑 (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) > 0 ( 6 ) With the addition of this set of inter - content trials , we can con - struct a larger matrix 𝑋 , solved with GLM or MLE , and estimate the difference of scales between a group of perceptual curves , refer to figure 2 for a complete example of solving . 𝑋 = (cid:169)(cid:173)(cid:173)(cid:173)(cid:173)(cid:173)(cid:173)(cid:173)(cid:173)(cid:173)(cid:173)(cid:173) (cid:171) 0 0 0 0 0 0 𝑋 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 𝑋 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 − 1 0 0 0 0 − 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 − 1 0 0 0 0 0 − 1 0 1 0 (cid:170)(cid:174)(cid:174)(cid:174)(cid:174)(cid:174)(cid:174)(cid:174)(cid:174)(cid:174)(cid:174)(cid:174) (cid:172) ( 7 ) 𝑋 is composed of submatrices ( 𝑋 1 , 𝑋 2 ) of intra - content compar - isons for a content 𝐶 1 and 𝐶 2 and a third matrix of inter - content comparisons : the last two rows in the example above . GLM and MLE implementation for intra and inter - content scal - ing are available in this software implementation . In addition , we 459 Perceptual annotation of local distortions in videos : tools and datasets MMSys ’23 , June 7 – 10 , 2023 , Vancouver , BC , Canada provided three datasets of inter - content annotations to run a demon - stration of the code . The stimuli evaluated are borrowed from the dataset presented in [ 14 ] . We applied MLDS methodology to estimate supra - threshold differences in small videos , tubes , encoded using libaom - AV1 1 . In this application context , 𝐶 𝑖 defined previously is a tube - content , a set with a reference tube and 5 levels of distortions : 𝐶 𝑖 = { 𝑆 𝑖 1 , 𝑆 𝑖 2 , . . . , 𝑆 𝑖 6 } . The reference tube of size 64 × 64 pixels and 400 ms is extracted from a 1080p video source ( SRC ) . The 5 distorted tubes are extracted at the exact spatial and temporal location but in 5 Processed Video Sequences ( PVS ) . The PVSs are generated from an SRC encoded using libaom - AV1 at various Quantization Parameter ( QP ) values . The datasets were collected in an in - lab experiment with 15 subjects . Each session lasts , on average , 7 minutes and contains 40 trials to annotate . We collected quadruplet , triplet , and pair - based intra - content comparisons . In addition , we collected inter - content comparisons from quadruplets to retrieve the scaling between the tube - contents . It is worth noting that for inter - content comparison , triplets and pairs are not possible with this type of stimuli . Since we want to estimate with a quadruplet ( a , b , c , d ) how far a stimulus 𝑎 is from its reference stimulus 𝑏 , compared with another stimulus 𝑐 and its reference stimulus 𝑑 . 2 . 3 Quadruplet - based intra - content dataset We collected data on the 8 tube - contents described above for the quadruplet dataset . The 6 stimuli yield 15 possible quadruplets per tube - content . From a 𝐶 𝑖 = { 𝑆 𝑖 1 , 𝑆 𝑖 2 , . . . , 𝑆 𝑖 6 } , quadruplets are { ( 𝑆 𝑖 1 , 𝑆 𝑖 2 , 𝑆 𝑖 3 , 𝑆 𝑖 4 ) , ( 𝑆 𝑖 1 , 𝑆 𝑖 2 , 𝑆 𝑖 3 , 𝑆 𝑖 5 ) , . . . , ( 𝑆 𝑖 3 , 𝑆 𝑖 4 , 𝑆 𝑖 5 , 𝑆 𝑖 6 ) } . We divided these 120 quadruplets from the eight tube - contents into three playlists of 40 trials . We collected 1800 annotations in total , with 15 participants on each of the playlists . 2 . 4 Triplet - based intra - content dataset In this dataset , we collected data on the 8 tube - contents using triplets generated following the procedure presented in the MLDS paper [ 5 ] . Here the 6 stimuli ( i . e . , reference + 5 levels of distortions ) yield 20 triplets to annotate for each content . We divided the 160 triplets from 8 tube - contents into four playlists of 40 trials . We collected 1760 annotations with 11 participants on each of the playlists . From 𝐶 𝑖 = { 𝑆 𝑖 1 , 𝑆 𝑖 2 , . . . , 𝑆 𝑖 6 } , triplets are { ( 𝑆 𝑖 1 , 𝑆 𝑖 2 , 𝑆 𝑖 3 ) , ( 𝑆 𝑖 1 , 𝑆 𝑖 2 , 𝑆 𝑖 4 ) , . . . , ( 𝑆 𝑖 4 , 𝑆 𝑖 5 , 𝑆 𝑖 6 ) } 2 . 5 Pairwise - based intra - content dataset This dataset uses pairwise comparisons with 6 stimuli ; 15 pairs must be annotated . From 𝐶 𝑖 = { 𝑆 𝑖 1 , 𝑆 𝑖 2 , . . . , 𝑆 𝑖 6 } , pairs are { ( 𝑆 𝑖 1 , 𝑆 𝑖 2 ) , ( 𝑆 𝑖 1 , 𝑆 𝑖 3 ) , . . . , ( 𝑆 𝑖 5 , 𝑆 𝑖 6 ) } We decided to divide the 120 pairs into three playlists . We collected 1800 annotations with 15 participants on each of the playlists . 1 AV1 encoder v3 . 1 . 2 , from AOM Alliance Open Media : https : / / aomedia . googlesource . com / aom / 2 . 6 Quadruplet - based inter - content dataset We used the active - sampling method proposed in [ 15 ] to collect inter - content scaling information . The sampling of the quadruplets was iteratively performed on the estimates recovered by the GLM solver . The data used to initialize the active - sampling is a concate - nation of the three previously described datasets to avoid any unfair advantage in later analysis . The sampling procedure was stopped after 55 sessions of 40 quadruplets were annotated . All the datasets are summarized in table 1 .

The results from the three datasets are avail - able in figure 2 . In figure 2 ( left ) , the MLE solving is applied on a matrix contain - ing the Pairwise - based intra - content dataset and the Quadruplet - based inter - content dataset : in total 4000 annotations . In figure 2 ( middle ) , the same solving is applied to the Triplet - based intra - content dataset with the Quadruplet - based inter - content dataset ( e . g . , 3940 annotations ) , and figure 2 ( right ) the Quadruplet - based intra - contentdatasetwiththeQuadruplet - based inter - contentdataset ( e . g . , 4000 annotations ) . Confidence Intervals ( CI ) in the three solv - ing are retrieved via bootstrapping [ 20 ] . To comment on the results , all the curves start with stimulus 0 being the reference at a perception of 0 : The reference being indistinguishable from itself . The stimuli from " patch 1750 " seems to have the most visible distortions across the three datasets , with , for example , in 2 ( left ) solving an estimation of 1 . 53 on the perception scale for the 6th stimulus . This stimulus corresponds to the highest compression level applied on the patch with libaom - AV1 . In figure 3 , we analyzed the impact of increasing the number of annotations for each dataset . Curves always start on the x - axis with annotation count corresponding to 100 % of intra - content re - spective datasets plus 5 % of the inter - content comparison dataset . Increments are a fraction of the inter - content comparison dataset from 5 % to 100 % . The CIs on the curves are obtained via 100 random Monte Carlo sampling simulations . In figure 3 ( left ) , we compare the evolution of the Root Mean Score Error ( RMSE ) between the retrieved scores for each stimulus of the dataset and the retrieved scores using 100 % of the dataset . Usually , the right part of each curve should be expected to be at 0 , but variations can occur due to the bootstrapping involved in the MLE solving . We can see from this figure that the quadruplet and pairwise methodologies converge faster to their final estimates than the triplet - based intra - content method . 460 MMSys ’23 , June 7 – 10 , 2023 , Vancouver , BC , Canada Pastor , et al . Figure 2 : MLE solving on the three datasets with intra - content comparisons using pairs ( left ) , triplets ( middle ) , or quadruplets ( right ) and also the inter - content quadruplet comparison dataset . CIs are obtained via bootstrapping [ 20 ] over 100 runs . Figure 3 : Analysis of the MLE solving accuracy on the three datasets with increasing annotations count ( x - axis ) . On the y - axis , we compare the evolution of RMSE to the estimated ground truth , the size of bootstrapped CI , and the ratio of significantly different pairs in each dataset . CI on the curves obtained via 100 random Monte Carlo sampling simulations . In figure 3 ( middle ) , the evolution of the size of the CIs estimated by the MLE solver is compared . This value is obtained by taking the average the CI of each score after solving . Again quadruplet and pairwise methodologies’ CI sizes are decreasing faster than the triplet - based method . With an advantage for the quadruplet method since , with around 2000 annotations , the average CI size is 0 . 1 and over 0 . 125 for the pairwise approach . Finally , in 3 ( right ) , we analyzed the evolution of discriminability between stimuli with an increasing number of annotations ( x - axis ) . In [ 3 , 12 ] , the authors investigated the growth of subjective scores discriminability to show how well a subjective methodology can retrieve accurate Mean Opinion Scores . A two - sample Wilcoxon test is performed on all the possible pairs of stimuli of the dataset . A p - value of 0 . 05 is used to compute the percentage of significantly different pairs . We can see that the quadruplet method is of higher discriminabil - ity , with a curve above the triplet and pairwise method . After 3000 annotations on each dataset , we can comment that adding more inter - content quadruplet annotations does not in - crease the discriminability or decrease the size of CIs . A plateau is formed . We can conclude that , for our use case of annotation of local distortion in videos , we reach the limit of the methods , and adding more time and resources is not worth it . 4 CONCLUSION In this work , we provide an open - sourced python implementation of Maximum Likelihood difference Scaling with inter - content dif - ference scaling . We explored a use case to quantify the perceived local distortion in patches of videos encoded using libaom - AV1 . We show from judgments collected , using pairwise , triplet , and quadruplet comparisons , that we can retrieve a scaling inside a group of eight contents . We are proving that our method of inter - quadruplet comparisons can reliably be applied to scale the esti - mated scores from these three datasets on a unique global percep - tual scale . We analyzed the collected datasets to showcase the accuracy and the discriminability that this method can achieve . In future work , we plan to collect a large - scale dataset of tube - contents using this method , following the research proposal we presented at ACM MMSys’22 Doctoral Symposium in [ 13 ] .
