CorrÞa , Jr . * [ a ] Introduction The ability to study the dynamic functions of proteins in living cells has been greatly aided by the development and applica - tion of tagging tools . [ 1 , 2 ] An emerging technique for live - cell imaging and proteomics applications is the site - specific label - ing of cellular proteins with chemical probes . [ 3 – 6 ] In this ap - proach , small organic molecules are coupled to the protein being studied via a fusion tag , either by self - labeling or enzy - matic ligation . Several different peptide and protein fusion tags have been developed to study proteins in living systems , including the tetracysteine tag , [ 7 ] HaloTag , [ 8 ] TMP - tag , [ 9 ] b - lacta - mase - tag , [ 10 ] ACP - tag , [ 11 ] BirA acceptor peptide , [ 12 ] and LplA ac - ceptor peptide . [ 13 ] Among the most prominent fusion tags is the SNAP - tag , an engineered variant of the human repair pro - tein O 6 - alkylguanine - DNA alkyltransferase ( hAGT ) that covalent - ly reacts with O 6 - benzylguanine ( BG ) derivatives bearing a chemical or optical probe . [ 14 , 15 ] During the reaction with a sub - strate , a stable thioether bond is formed between the reactive cysteine of the tag and the label . SNAP - tag reactions proceed with a well - defined mechanism , predictable stoichiometry and rapid kinetics , irrespective of the fusion protein attached to the tag . SNAP - tag labeling offers a variety of advantages over traditional tagging of proteins using autofluorescence . In addi - tion to labeling by fluorescent probes , SNAP - tag fusion pro - teins can be modified with affinity ligands or other binding moieties , [ 16 ] used for selective crosslinking of interacting pro - tein partners , [ 17 , 18 ] immobilization on solid surfaces for purifica - tion , pull - downs , and protein microarray experiments , [ 19 ] and allows temporal control over labeling . All these features pro - vide an additional level of sophistication and flexibility for as - sessing protein function and dynamics in cell biology . The utili - ty of the SNAP - tag self - labeling technology has been demon - strated for the study of protein localization and trafficking in live mammalian cells . [ 20 , 21 ] Despite the ease of temporal control and broad range of commercially available fluorescent probes , widespread use of SNAP - tag for visualization and study of protein dynamics is limited by background fluorescence from unreacted or non - specifically bound substrates . Klein et al . have recently report - ed that coating the glass chambers with glycine prior to seed - ing cells minimizes the nonspecific adsorption of fluorophore conjugates on glass surfaces for super - resolution imaging ap - The ability to specifically attach chemical probes to individual proteins represents a powerful approach to the study and manipulation of protein function in living cells . It provides a simple , robust and versatile approach to the imaging of fusion proteins in a wide range of experimental settings . However , a potential drawback of detection using chemical probes is the fluorescence background from unreacted or nonspecifically bound probes . In this report we present the design and appli - cation of novel fluorogenic probes for labeling SNAP - tag fusion proteins in living cells . SNAP - tag is an engineered var - iant of the human repair protein O 6 - alkylguanine - DNA alkyl - transferase ( hAGT ) that covalently reacts with benzylguanine derivatives . Reporter groups attached to the benzyl moiety become covalently attached to the SNAP tag while the gua - nine acts as a leaving group . Incorporation of a quencher on the guanine group ensures that the benzylguanine probe be - comes highly fluorescent only upon labeling of the SNAP - tag protein . We describe the use of intramolecularly quenched probes for wash - free labeling of cell surface - localized epider - mal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) fused to SNAP - tag and for direct quantification of SNAP - tagged b - tubulin in cell lysates . In addition , we have characterized a fast - labeling variant of SNAP - tag , termed SNAP f , which displays up to a tenfold in - crease in its reactivity towards benzylguanine substrates . The presented data demonstrate that the combination of SNAP f and the fluorogenic substrates greatly reduces the background fluorescence for labeling and imaging applications . This ap - proach enables highly sensitive spatiotemporal investigation of protein dynamics in living cells . [ a ] Dr . X . Sun , Dr . A . Zhang , B . Baker , Dr . L . Sun , A . Howard , J .

[ 22 ] However , as for the vast majority of chemical la - beling approaches , a thorough wash step is still required to reduce fluorescence signals due to the presence of unreacted probes . Besides being a tedious and time - consuming process , this requirement may potentially limit some applications , such as direct quantification of protein concentration in cell lysates or real - time monitoring of molecular events like receptor - ligand binding , endocytosis , trafficking , and expression of newly synthesized proteins . Thus a strong need remains for efficient molecular imaging methods that enable researchers to access real - time detection and high - contrast imaging . Herein , we report the design and application of intramolecu - larly quenched ( “dark” ) fluorogenic benzylguanine probes that become highly fluorescent upon reaction with a SNAP - tag . The utility of this approach has been very recently demonstrated by Komatsu et al . using SNAP - tag technology and three acti - vatable fluorescent probes to conduct real - time measurements of protein dynamics . [ 23 ] We further advance the value of SNAP - tag labeling technology by combining a faster labeling variant of SNAP - tag , termed SNAP f , with a broader range of fluorogen - ic benzylguanine probes for wash - free labeling of fusion pro - teins in living cells . Our strategy was to explore different com - binations of fluorophore / quencher pairs in an attempt to obtain optimal intramolecularly quenched substrates with fluo - rescence emission across the visible spectrum , while retaining a rapid reaction rate between the probe and fusion protein tag ( Figure 1 ) . Fluorogenic substrates generate an intense fluorescence signal only after reaction with their targets , therefore greatly reducing background fluorescence . [ 10 , 24 , 25 ] The high signal - to - noise ratio of the fluorogenic substrates enables wash - free assays , and as a consequence , facilitates high - throughput screening [ 26 – 28 ] and real - time analysis of dynamic cellular pro - cesses , such as protein expression , localization , trafficking and degradation . [ 29 – 31 ] In order to demonstrate the utility of SNAP f and these self - quenching probes , we designed an assay to measure the concentration of proteins in cell extracts and demonstrated wash - free , high - contrast imaging of plasma membrane localization of the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) in living HEK293 cells . We also describe a colocalization study of SNAP f - EGFR with epidermal growth factor ligand fused to a fast labeling version of the related CLIP - tag [ 32 ] pro - tein ( EGF - CLIP f ) . Results and Discussion Design and synthesis of fluorogenic substrates SNAP - tag fluorogenic probes consist of benzylguanine sub - strates bearing an organic fluorophore attached at the periph - ery of the benzylic ring and an appropriate dark quencher lo - cated on the C - 8 position of the guanine ring ( Figure 1 ) . Upon reaction with the SNAP - tag , the free quencher - bound guanine group is released into solution leading to a large increase in the relative fluorescence intensity of the fluorophore , which re - mains attached to the protein tag . Analysis of the structure of the wild - type human AGT suggested that the introduction of substituents at the C - 8 position of guanine would have few sterically unfavorable interactions within the active site of the protein . [ 33 ] Several other positions were ruled out based on previous studies showing that minor changes such as the addi - tion of methyl groups to the N - 2 or N - 7 position of O 6 - benzyl - guanine impedes AGT activity , [ 34 ] while caging of BG substrates at N - 7 or N - 9 abolishes activity towards the SNAP - tag . [ 35 ] It is important to note that although the presence of substituents at solvent - exposed C - 8 and N - 9 positions may be tolerated for wild - type AGT , N - 9 substituted BG substrates exhibit much lower reactivity towards the SNAP - tag because mutations have been introduced in the protein that obstruct the guanine - bind - ing pocket at the N - 9 position . [ 36 ] These observations have been confirmed by Komatsu et al . , who measured the activity of the SNAP - tag protein with various C - 8 and N - 9 BG deriva - tives . They found that while the C - 8 modification decreased the labeling rate by a factor of 4 ( C - 8 - carboxyethyl - BG , k ~ 5(cid:3) 10 3 s (cid:2) 1 m (cid:2) 1 ) compared to unmodified BG substrates ( BG , k ~ 2(cid:3) 10 4 s (cid:2) 1 m (cid:2) 1 ) , the N - 9 modification dramatically reduced the Figure 1 .

[ 23 ] The efficiency of FRET - based quenching is dependent on the distance between the fluorophore donor and the quencher acceptor , and the degree of overlap between the fluorophore emission and quencher absorption spectra . Therefore , we se - lected fluorophore / quencher pairs from commercially available probes displaying significant spectral overlap and complemen - tary reactive chemical functionalities for the design of the fluo - rogenic substrates ( Table 1 ) . We also employed a broad range non - fluorescent quencher , IRDye QC - 1 , which has been report - ed to efficiently quench the visible to near - infrared emission of fluorophores . [ 37 ] Substrates were prepared in a sequential one - pot , 2 - step protocol , starting from the coupling of the CBG - NH 2 building block with succinimidyl esters of the correspond - ing fluorophores , followed by a HBTU - mediated reaction with the amino - modified quenchers ( Scheme 1 ) . The synthetic strat - egy was designed to avoid the need for purification of any intermediate compounds and to expedite the assembly of fluorophore / quencher pairs into a SNAP - tag - reactive benzyl - guanine core for initial screening studies . The fluorogenic probes CBG - 488 - DABCYL and CBG - 488 - TQ2 were synthesized using the fluorescent dye ATTO 488 , which has an emission maximum at 523 nm , and the dark quenchers DABCYL and TQ2 , which exhibit absorption maxima between 450 and 550 nm . The fluorogenic probes CBG - 549 - TQ3 , CBG - 549 - QSY7 and CBG - TF3 - TQ3 were synthesized using the fluo - rescent dyes DY - 549 and TF3 , which have emission maxima at 575 and 578 nm , respectively , and the quenchers TQ3 and QSY - 7 , which exhibit absorption maxima between 550 and 600 nm . The fluorogenic probes CBG - TF5 - QSY21 and CBG - TF5 - QXL670 were synthesized using the fluorescent dye TF5 , which has emission maximum at 670 nm , and the quenchers QSY - 21 and QXL - 670 , which display absorption spectra ranging from 600 – 700 nm . The fluorogenic probes CBG - 549 - QC1 , CBG - 647 - QC1 and CBG - AF647 - QC1 were synthesized using the fluores - cent dyes DY - 549 , DY - 647 , and Alexa Fluor 647 , which have emission maxima at 575 , 672 , and 665 nm , respectively , and the non - fluorescent broad range quencher dye IRDye QC - 1 , which is compatible with fluorophores that emit in the 500 – 800 nm range . The final products were purified by reverse - phase C18 HPLC and characterized by HRMS and UV spectros - copy . The fluorescent covalent adducts resulting from the re - action between the SNAP - tagged protein and the fluorogenic substrates were further characterized by mass spectrometry ( Table S2 in the Supporting Information ) . The synthetic ap - proach is illustrated for the CBG - 549 - QSY7 substrate ( Scheme 1 ) . Characterization of a fast - labeling SNAP - tag variant SNAP f , a SNAP - tag variant based on a previously described hAGT mutant , [ 38 ] was used for the labeling experiments . The additional point mutations in SNAP f are described in Figure S1 . SNAP f carries 19 amino acid substitutions and a C - terminal Table 1 . Characterization of fluorogenic SNAP - tag substrates .

We first compared the reactivity of purified SNAP f and SNAP26m proteins towards several fluorophore BG conjugates using their second order rate constants . SNAP f showed up to tenfold increased in vitro activity relative to SNAP26m ( Table S1 ) . The time required for 50 % labeling of SNAP f at 1 m m protein con - centration with 5 m m SNAP - Surface 488 ( BG - 488 ) , SNAP - Cell TMR - star , SNAP - Surface 549 ( BG - 549 ) , and SNAP - Surface Alexa Fluor 647 ( BG - AF647 ) , was calculated to be 11 , 12 , 13 , and 34 s , respectively . Having shown that SNAP f efficiently reacts with fluorescent BG substrates , we next examined the rate of reaction of SNAP f with the self - quenching fluorogenic probes . An improved rate of covalent labeling was desirable as we expected the reactivi - ty of substrates carrying a quencher group at the guanine C - 8 position to be slower than C - 8 unmodified BG substrates . This hypothesis was later validated by ourselves as well as Komatsu et al . [ 23 ] The fluorogenic probe CBG - 488 - TQ2 was used as a model to compare the relative activities of SNAP f and SNAP26m . Initial experiments revealed that the labeling of SNAP f with CBG - 488 - TQ2 was approximately tenfold faster than of SNAP26m ( Figure S3 ) . The SNAP f mutant showed in - creased reactivity against various BG derivatives ( Table S1 ) and proved to be essential to achieve experimentally useful reac - tion rates with the BG fluorogenic probes . Furthermore , we found that a single specific mutation ( E30R ) of SNAP f trans - ferred to the benzylcytosine - specific CLIP - tag resulted in in - creased labeling rates of this mutant ( CLIP f ) towards CLIP - tag substrates ( data not shown ) . In vitro characterization of fluorogenic substrates Based on these results , we decided to investigate the labeling of SNAP f with a collection of fluorogenic substrates containing combinations of fluorophore / quencher pairs spanning the visi - ble spectrum . We first determined the quenching efficiency of each substrate . To this end , substrate ( 5 m m ) was incubated in the presence or absence of purified SNAP f protein ( 10 m m ) , and the fluorescence recovery was monitored in 5 min intervals over 2 h at 25 8 C using a scanning fluorometer . In vitro quench - ing assays indicated 76 – 99 % fluorescence recovery after incu - bation of the fluorogenic probes with SNAP f ( Table 1 ) . The ma - jority of quenchers were effective , resulting in substantially lower fluorescence signals for the free substrate species com - pared to unquenched BG conjugates . No single fluorophore or quencher was universally better than the others . Rather , our results indicate that quenching and labeling efficiencies were highly dependent on the pairwise combinations . Several fluorogenic substrates showed quenching efficien - cies greater than 95 % , which corresponds to a ~ 20 - fold in - crease in the fluorescence signal upon labeling the SNAP f pro - tein . CBG - 488 - TQ2 and CBG - 549 - QSY7 showed quenching effi - ciencies greater than 98 % or ~ 50 - fold increase in the fluores - cence signal . It has previously been observed that guanine can quench the fluorescence of particular dyes by photo - induced electron transfer ( PET ) . [ 39 ] Stohr et al . investigated 21 different BG - fluorophore conjugates , some of which showed a tenfold increase in fluorescence emission upon reaction with SNAP - tag . Assessment of our BG - fluorophores indicate that guanine - induced PET quenches the following fluorophores to various degrees : SNAP - Surface 488 ( 80 % ) , SNAP - Surface 549 ( 55 % ) , SNAP - Surface 647 ( 22 % ) , and SNAP - Surface Alexa Fluor 647 ( 7 % ) . Therefore , we conclude that the overall observed quenching efficiency of the fluorogenic substrates is a result of both the FRET - based and the guanine PET - based quenching . We also analyzed quenching and labeling efficiencies by in - gel fluorescence scanning ( Figure 2 ) . For this purpose , sub - strate ( 10 m m ) was incubated in the presence or absence of pu - rified SNAP f protein ( 5 m m ) for 30 min , followed by SDS - PAGE and analysis with a fluorescence imager . In - gel detection analy - sis indicated the SNAP f protein was labeled with fluorogenic substrates ( Figure 2A lanes 4 and 6 , Figure 2B lanes 4 , 6 , and 8 , and Figure 2C lanes 4 , 6 , and 10 ) with an intensity that was comparable to the SNAP f product labeled with unquenched substrates ( Figure 2A lane 2 , B lane 2 , and C lanes 2 and 8 ) . Moreover , we observed a significant reduction in the fluores - cence intensity of the unreacted fluorogenic substrates ( lower bands ; Figure 2A lanes 3 – 6 , B lanes 3 – 8 , and C lanes 3 – 6 and 9 – 10 ) compared to the unquenched substrates ( lower bands ; Figure 2A lanes 1 – 2 , B lanes 1 – 2 , and C lanes 1 – 2 and 7 – 8 ) . As expected , these results clearly demonstrate an efficient fluores - cence recovery after incubation of the quencher - containing substrates with the SNAP f protein . Kinetic analysis A kinetic analysis of the SNAP labeling reaction was carried out with the fluorogenic substrates having the highest quenching efficiencies . The kinetic analysis was determined by incubating substrate ( 5 m m ) with purified SNAP f protein ( 1 m m ) in reaction buffer ( 1 m m DTT , 1(cid:3)PBS ) at 22 8 C and removing aliquots at 0 , 0 . 25 , 0 . 5 , 0 . 75 , 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 16 , 32 , and 64 min . Labeling efficiency was evaluated using SDS - PAGE and in - gel fluorescence scan - ning . The individual rate constants were determined from the average of triplicate experiments ( Table 1 ) . Two important re - sults emerged from these kinetics studies . First , the quencher - containing substrates showed a marked decrease in the second order rate constants compared to the corresponding unquenched substrates . We attribute this decrease to an ad - verse steric effect caused by the incorporation of a quencher at the C - 8 position of guanine on binding and transfer of the fluorophore moiety to the protein tag . This is supported by the observation that incorporation of different quenchers re - duced the reactivity of the fluorogenic substrates from 10 - to 100 - fold relative to their parent substrates . For instance , CBG - 488 - TQ2 reacts 15 - fold slower than SNAP - Surface 488 , whereas CBG - 488 - DABCYL reacts about 72 - fold slower than SNAP - Sur - face 488 . Despite the fact that fluorogenic substrates are signif - icantly less reactive ( t 1 / 2 3 to 18 min ) than the substrates with - out a quencher moiety ( t 1 / 2 11 to 34 s ) , ESI - TOF mass analysis indicates complete labeling of SNAP f after 60 min incubation with most of the substrates ( Table S2 ) . Additionally , our results 2220 www . chembiochem . org (cid:2) 2011 Wiley - VCH Verlag GmbH & Co . KGaA , Weinheim ChemBioChem 2011 , 12 , 2217 – 2226 I . R . CorrÞa , Jr . et al . show the fluorophore itself affects activity towards SNAP - tag . For example , SNAP - Surface 488 and SNAP - Surface 549 react up to threefold faster than SNAP - Surface Alexa Fluor 647 . Taken together , these data suggest both fluorophore and quencher affect the binding and conjugation of the substrate to the SNAP f protein . Quantification of fusion proteins in cell lysates We next investigated the application of these fluorogenic sub - strates as a tool for protein quantification . In view of the fact that the fluorescence recovery of the fluorogenic substrates di - rectly correlates with their labeling by SNAP f , we hypothesized that their relative fluorescence intensity could serve as the basis for the measurement of the concentration of a given tagged protein . To test this hypothesis , the fluorescence inten - sity of CBG - 488 - TQ2 after incubation with various concentra - tions of purified SNAP f protein was measured . All reactions were carried out in triplicate and a nontransfected U2OS cell lysate was included in the reaction buffer to mimic mammalian cell lysis conditions . The results show a linear correlation ( R > 0 . 99 ) between the fluorescence signal and SNAP f protein con - centration ( Figure 3A ) . Next the assay was extended to a U2OS stable cell line expressing SNAP f - b - tubulin . Serial dilution of the total U2OS cell lysate was incubated with 0 . 5 m m of CBG - 488 - TQ2 for 4 . 5 h at room temperature , and the total protein concentration ( mgmL (cid:2) 1 ) was plotted against the concentration of SNAP f - b - tu - bulin in the cell lysate ( Figure 3B ) . We observed a reproducible linear relationship between the SNAP f - b - tubulin protein con - centration and the total protein concentration , and that the signal - to - background ratio over the nontransfected cell lysate was approximately 13 : 1 ( Figure 3C ) . To test whether this assay was compatible with a high - throughput screening format , we plated the U2OS cells stably expressing SNAP f - b - tubulin into a 96 - well plate , directly lysed cells by adding lysis buffer to the wells , and then detected the fluorescence recovery of the CBG - 488 - TQ2 substrate under the same conditions . In these experi - ments , the signal - to - noise ratio ( average fluorescence intensi - ty / standard deviation ) and the signal - to - background ratio ( average fluorescence intensity of transfected U2OS cells / aver - age fluorescence intensity of nontransfected U2OS cells ) were 316 . 8 and 5 . 3 , respectively , indicating the versatility and ro - bustness of the fluorogenic substrates and their potential for direct detection and quantification of tagged proteins in com - plex biosystems . Wash - free labeling of fusion proteins in living cells Finally , we sought to demonstrate the feasibility of wash - free labeling of fusion proteins in living cells . To this end , we de - signed a SNAP f - EGFR fusion protein and stably expressed the fusion protein in HEK293 cells . EGFR was selected as a model system because it is thought to contribute to cell signaling [ 40 , 41 ] and is implicated in many disease states . [ 42 ] To test if the label - ing of the SNAP f - EGFR fusion protein could be performed in wash - free conditions , we selected the fluorogenic substrates that displayed quenching efficiencies greater than 90 % ( i . e . , at least tenfold increase in fluorescence signal upon SNAP f label - ing ) . Cells were incubated with 1 m m of each fluorogenic sub - strate for 30 min and then treated with SNAP - Surface Block ( New England Biolabs ) at a concentration of 20 m m to inhibit further labeling of SNAP f - EGFR . The fluorescence images of cells labeled with CBG - 549 - QSY7 revealed clear cell - surface Figure 2 . In - gel detection analysis of fluorogenic substrates . Purified SNAP f protein ( + ) was labeled by various fluorogenic substrates : SNAP - Surface 488 ( BG - 488 ) , CBG - 488 - Dabcyl , CBG - 488 - TQ2 , SNAP - Surface 549 ( BG - 549 ) , CBG - 549 - TQ3 , CBG - 549 - QSY7 , CBG - 549 - QC1 , CBG - TF5 , CBG - TF5 - QSY21 , CBG - TF5 - QXL670 , SNAP - Surface Alexa Fluor 647 ( BG - AF647 ) , and CBG - AF647 - QC1 . The samples were subjected to SDS - PAGE and scanned with a Typhoon 9400 imager using appropriate filter sets . The upper band ( marked with * ) corre - sponds to the labeled SNAP f protein ; lower bands correspond to unreacted dyes .

KGaA , Weinheim www . chembiochem . org 2221 SNAP - Tag Fluorogenic Probes imaging even in the presence of the labeling medium contain - ing an excess of the unreacted fluorogenic substrate ( Fig - ure 4B ) . Similarly , cells labeled with the fluorogenic substrate CBG - 488 - DABCYL , CBG - 488 - TQ2 , CBG - AF647 - QC1 , and CBG - TF5 - QSY21 showed high signal - to - background contrast both in the presence and in the absence of the labeling medium ( Fig - ures S4B , S4C , S5B , and S6B ) . On the other hand , fluorescence images of the HEK293 cells labeled with conventional SNAP - tag substrates , such as SNAP - Surface 488 , SNAP - Surface 549 and SNAP - Alexa Fluor 647 , taken under the same conditions , showed cell surface staining with much less contrast and higher background signal ( Fig - ure 4A and Figures S4A , S5A , and S6A ) , therefore requiring a washing step to remove excess unreacted fluorophore . Howev - er , one should note that the cell images obtained with both unquenched and quenched substrates after rigorous washing are virtually indistinguishable . Notably , SNAP - Surface 488 , whose fluorophore is strongly quenched by guanine , exhibited a remarkably high signal - to - noise ratio in live cells even before the removal of media and subsequent washing steps ( Fig - ure S4A ) . It is clear from our observations that the data ob - tained for wash - free live cell labeling is consistent with the high quenching efficiencies observed in the in vitro assays . Fur - thermore , distinct and specific surface labeling of HEK293 ex - pressing SNAP f - EGFR could be visualized after an incubation time as short as 5 min using 5 m m CBG - 549 - QSY7 . This demon - strates that the visualization of cell membrane - localized targets can be achieved within a few minutes of labeling without the removal of any unreacted substrates . Figure 3 .

Next , we investigated whether the fluorogenic substrates could be used for in vivo labeling of intracellular targets . We found that all fluorogenic probes described in the Table 1 were cell - impermeant . These results are consistent with previous re - ports that fluorescent dyes carrying negatively charged groups cannot passively cross cell membranes . [ 43 ] Consequently , we evaluated some of the cytoplasmic delivery techniques that have been reported to allow membrane - impermeant fluoro - phore conjugates to be introduced into living cells . [ 43 , 44 ] We successfully obtained wash - free images of intracellular SNAP f - tagged histone H2B or b - tubulin in U2OS cells using a bead - loading method to deliver the CBG - 549 - TQ3 probe ( Figure S7A and B ) . In addition , commonly used transfection reagents , such as Fugene 6 ( Roche ) , were also shown to deliver cell - imperme - ant substrates and thus enable the labeling of cytosolic SNAP - tagged proteins ( Figure S7C ) . It should be noted that only a small fraction ( < 5 % ) of the cells were labeled using either the glass beads or transfection reagents . Lastly , we demonstrated the application of this approach for a two - color fluorescence visualization of the EGF / EGFR ligand – receptor complex ( Figure 5 ) . To study the colocalization of the ligand – receptor complex , EGF was cloned as a fusion to the engineered CLIP f mutant . CLIP f contains an extra amino acid substitution ( E30R ) compared to the CLIP - tag . For the colocali - zation assay , purified recombinant EGF - CLIP f was fluorescently labeled with CLIP - Surface 488 . HEK293 cells stably expressing SNAP f - EGFR were labeled with CBG - 549 - QSY7 . Cells were then incubated for 2 min with labeled EGF - CLIP f and directly imaged by a confocal microscope without removal of the medium or any washing step . Analyses of fluorescence images clearly showed colocalization ( yellow ) of labeled SNAP f - EGFR ( red ) and its receptor EGF - CLIP f ( green ) . The data demonstrate the potential of this system for rapid and sensitive detection of EGFR and the EGFR / EGF receptor – ligand complex . The possibil - ity of performing real - time analysis of receptor endocytosis in response to extracellular stimulus , such as ligand binding , could now be envisaged as a prospective application of this system . Conclusions In summary , we have developed and characterized novel fluo - rogenic substrates of high quenching efficiency for analysis of dynamic processes in living cells utilizing a new generation of fast self - labeling SNAP - tag protein . This site - specific labeling system offers unique advantages , including wash - free , real - time visualization of SNAP - tagged proteins in cell lysates and in living cells . This method should be particularly applicable in systems where sensitive detection is required , including pro - tein quantification and single - molecule microscopy , or in high - throughput screening platforms where the response of screen - ing assays needs to be clearly defined and assessed in a timely fashion , minimizing the interference from nonspecific fluores - cent species and avoiding separation steps which can make automation difficult . The labeling system described here opens new avenues for the spatiotemporal resolution of fluorescence signals that is required for real - time monitoring of highly dynamic processes in living cells , and for high - throughput screening of proteins in complex biosystems and drug discov - ery . Experimental Section Chemical methods : Commercially available compounds were used without further purification . All fluorogenic substrates for the label - ing of SNAP - tag fusion proteins were prepared by reacting the building block CBG - NH 2 ( New England Biolabs ) with commercially available N - hydroxysuccinimide esters of the corresponding fluoro - phores and amines of the corresponding quenchers . ATTO - 488 NHS was purchased from ATTO - TEC GmbH ( Siegen , Germany ) . Tide Fluor 3 ( TF3 ) NHS , Tide Fluor 5 ( TF5 ) NHS , Tide Quencher 2 ( TQ2 ) acid , Tide Quencher 3 ( TQ3 ) acid were purchased from AAT Bio - quest , Inc . ( Sunnyvale , CA ) . Dabcyl C2 amine and QXL670 C2 amine were purchased from AnaSpec , Inc . ( Fremont , CA ) . DY - 549 NHS and DY - 647 NHS were purchased from Dyomics GmbH ( Jena , Germany ) . Alexa Fluor 647 NHS , QSY - 7 amine , and QSY - 21 NHS were pur - chased from Life Technologies Co . ( Carlsbad , CA ) . IRDye QC - 1 NHS was provided by LI - COR Biosciences ( Lincoln , NE ) . QSY - 21 amine , TQ2 amine , TQ3 amine , and IRDye QC - 1 amine were synthesized by reacting N - Fmoc - 1 , 2 - diaminoethane hydrobromide ( Sigma – Al - drich ) with commercially available QSY - 21 NHS , TQ2 acid , TQ3 acid , and IRDye QC - 1 NHS , respectively . Due to the confidential or pro - prietary nature of the majority of fluorophores and quenchers used in this study , very limited information about chemical structures is available from dye manufacturers . Purification and analysis of substrates : Reversed - phase high - per - formance liquid chromatography ( RP - HPLC ) was performed on an Agilent LCMS Single Quad System 1200 Series ( analytical ) and Agilent 1100 Preparative - scale Purification System ( semi - prepara - tive ) . Analytical HPLC was performed on a Waters Atlantis T3 C18 column ( 2 . 1(cid:3)150 mm , 5 m m particle size ) at a flow rate of 0 . 5 mLmin (cid:2) 1 with a binary gradient from solvent A ( 0 . 1 % aq . formic acid ) to solvent B ( acetonitrile with 0 . 1 % formic acid ) and monitored by UV – visible absorbance at 280 nm and at the absorp - tion maximum of each fluorophore . Semi - preparative HPLC was performed on a VYDAC 218TP series C18 polymeric reversed - phase column ( 22(cid:3)250 mm , 10 m m particle size ) at a flow rate of 20 mLmin (cid:2) 1 using a water / acetonitrile gradient with trifluoroacetic acid ( 0 . 1 % ) or 1 m triethyl ammonium bicarbonate buffer ( 0 . 1 % ) .

Detailed experimental protocol and 1 H NMR spectrum for CBG - 549 - QSY7 ( Scheme S1 ) can be found in the Sup - porting Information . Substrates were further characterized by ESI - TOF mass spectrometry after their binding to the SNAP f protein ( Table S2 ) . Expression constructs ( Figure S2 ) : pSNAP f was constructed by in - sertion of the cDNA encoding SNAP f , synthesized by IDT , between the restriction sites EcoRI and SbfI of pSNAP - tag ( m ) ( New England Biolabs ) . This SNAP - tag variant , SNAP f , contains 19 amino acid sub - stitutions and an additional 24 - residue deletion at the C - terminus compared to the wild - type AGT . Constitutive expression of the SNAP f is under the control of a CMV promoter . The cDNA encoding the CLIP f was introduced between the EcoRI and SbfI sites of pSNAP f , resulting in pCLIP f . pSNAP f - tag ( T7 ) and pCLIP f - tag ( T7 ) were constructed by replacing the SNAP - 26 m coding region of pSNAP - tag ( T7 ) - 2 using the unique EcoRI and SbfI sites with the coding re - gions of SNAP f and CLIP f , respectively . The mouse EGF coding sequence was fused in - frame to the 5 ’ - end of SNAP f and CLIP f , and a hexahistidine tag ( His 6 ) was fused to the 3 ’ - end of SNAP f and CLIP f in pSNAP f - tag ( T7 ) and pCLIP f - tag ( T7 ) , re - spectively . The resulting plasmids pEGF - SNAP f - His 6 and pEGF - CLIP f - His 6 were used for expression of EGF - SNAP f and EGF - CLIP f fusion proteins in E . coli and subsequent affinity purification by Ni - NTA agarose ( Qiagen ) . A linker encoding the signal sequence of EGFR , formed by annealing 5 ’ - CTAGC ATGCG ACCCT CCGGG ACGGC CGGGG CAGCG CTCCT GGCGC TGCTG GCTGC GCTCT GCCCG GCGAG TCGGG CTG - 3 ’ - and 5 ’ - AATTC AGCCC GACTC GCCGG GCAGA GCGCA GCCAG CAGCG CCAGG AGCGC TGCCC CGGCC GTCCC GGAGG GTCGC ATG - 3 ’ , was inserted into the 5 ’ - MCS of the pSNAP f vector using the unique NheI and EcoRI sites ( underlined ) . Subsequently the coding sequence of mature EGFR ( GeneCopoeia ) was amplified by PCR and subcloned into the plasmid described above using the unique SbfI and NotI sites , creating pSNAP f - EGFR . SNAP f - b - tubulin was generated from the human b - tubulin coding sequence ( Open Biosystems ) which was amplified by PCR and fused in - frame to the 5 ’ - end of SNAP f in the pSNAP f vector . Fluorescence in - gel detection : SNAP f protein was labeled at 37 8 C for 30 min in the presence of SNAP f ( 5 m m ) , BG conjugate ( 10 m m ) and DTT ( 1 m m ) in PBS . The samples were submitted to electro - phoresis on a 10 – 20 % Tris - glycine gel under denaturing condi - tions . The gels were scanned using a Typhoon 9400 imager at 300 V PMT with a 488 / 526 nm ( Figure 2A , 488 in green ) , 532 / 580 nm ( Figure 2B , 549 in orange ) or 633 / 670 nm excitation / emis - sion filter set ( Figure 2C , TF5 and Alexa Fluor 647 in red ) . Assay of quenching efficiency : Fluorescence signals of the SNAP f proteins labeled with a fluorophore from a quenched or non - quenched substrate were analyzed with a FLEXstation scanning fluorometer ( Molecular Devices ) . The reactions were performed in 96 - well plates ( Costar ) and the fluorescence was measured at the appropriate wavelength . Reactions were carried out with dye ( 5 m m ) and DTT ( 1 m m ) in PBS in the presence or absence of SNAP f protein ( 10 m m ) . SNAP - Surface 488 and its fluorogenic derivatives were excited at 488 nm and measured at the maximum emission wavelength of 526 nm . SNAP - Surface 549 , CBG - TF3 and their fluo - rogenic derivatives were excited at 546 nm and measured at the maximum emission wavelength of 580 nm . Fluorescence of SNAP - Surface 647 , SNAP - Alexa Fluor 647 , CBG - TF5 and their fluorogenic derivatives was read at 636 nm with maximum emission of 670 nm . Fluorescence was followed in 5 min intervals over 2 h at 25 8 C . Quenching efficiencies were calculated by the equation E = 1 (cid:2) ( I FD / I SNAPf ) , where I FD indicates fluorescence intensity of free dyes and I SNAPf indicates fluorescence intensity of labeled SNAP f protein at the end of the 2 h reaction . Kinetic study : Labeling reactions were carried out at 22 8 C in the presence of dye ( 5 m m ) , SNAP f protein ( 1 m m ) and DTT ( 1 m m ) in PBS . At each of the following time points : 0 , 15 , 30 or 45 s , 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 16 , 32 or 64 min , 18 m L of the labeling reaction was removed and added to a microfuge tube containing 18 m L of 3(cid:3)Red SDS - PAGE loading buffer ( New England Biolabs ) . After boiling the sam - ples for 5 min , each sample ( 7 . 5 m L ) was loaded on a 10 – 20 % Tris - glycine gel ( Invitrogen ) . Following separation of proteins and free dyes on SDS - PAGE , the labeled SNAP f protein was detected with 2224 www . chembiochem . org (cid:2) 2011 Wiley - VCH Verlag GmbH & Co . KGaA , Weinheim ChemBioChem 2011 , 12 , 2217 – 2226 I . R . CorrÞa , Jr . et al . fluorescence imager Typhoon 9400 ( GE Healthcare ) . Gel scanning was performed with appropriate filter sets : excitation at 488 nm and emission at 526 nm for SNAP - Surface 488 and its fluorogenic derivatives ; excitation at 533 nm and emission at 580 nm for SNAP - Surface 549 , CBG - TF3 and their fluorogenic derivatives ; exci - tation at 633 nm and emission at 670 nm for SNAP - Surface 647 , SNAP - Alexa Fluor 647 , CBG - TF5 and their fluorogenic derivatives . The imaging data were quantified with ImageQuant TL software ( GE Healthcare ) . The data were fitted to an exponential rise model using the KaleidaGraph 4 . 0 software ( Synergy Software ) to get the pseudo - first - order rate constants . Second - order rate constants were then obtained by dividing the pseudo first - order constant by the concentration of substrate . Quantification of SNAP f - b - tubulin in cell lysates : To generate a standard curve of fluorescence intensity versus SNAP f protein con - centration , purified SNAP f protein ( 25 m L ) at a final concentration of 0 . 025 , 0 . 05 , 0 . 075 , 0 . 1 , 0 . 125 , and 0 . 25 m m were incubated with CBG - 488 - TQ2 ( 2 m m , 25 m L , final concentration 0 . 5 m m ) and of cell lysate ( 50 m L ) from nontransfected U2OS cells at room temperature for 4 . 5 h . The reaction was performed in triplicate in a 96 - well plate ( Costar ) . The fluorescence intensity was recorded at 526 nm emission maximum upon excitation at 488 nm and plotted against SNAP f protein concentration . The curve was fitted to a linear equa - tion . The concentration of SNAP f - b - tubulin was measured from cell ly - sates of U2OS cells stably expressing SNAP f - b - tubulin . Cells grown at 37 8 C in phenol red - free DMEM medium supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) , l - glutamine ( 2 m m ) , penicillin ( 100 units per mL ) , streptomycin ( 100 m gmL (cid:2) 1 ) and G418 ( 200 m gmL (cid:2) 1 ) were harvested from a 75 cm 2 ; cell culture flask ( BD Falcon ) with 0 . 25 % trypsin treatment , then washed and spun down . The cell pellet was lysed in 500 m L of CelLytic M cell lysis reagent ( Sigma – Aldrich ) for 15 min at room temperature . Total protein concentra - tion was determined by the Bradford assay . The cell lysate was seri - ally diluted with PBS buffer ( 1 : 1 , 1 : 2 , 1 : 4 , 1 : 8 , and 1 : 16 ) to generate cell lysate samples with various total protein concentrations . 50 m L of each dilution was mixed with 1 m m CBG - 488 - TQ2 ( 50 m L , final concentration 0 . 5 m m ) and incubated at room temperature for 4 . 5 h . The reaction was performed in triplicate in a 96 - well plate and the fluorescence intensity was recorded at 526 nm upon exci - tation at 488 nm . The fluorescence intensities were converted to SNAP f - b - tubulin protein concentrations by using the standard curve generated for SNAP f . The total protein concentration ( mgmL (cid:2) 1 ) was plotted against the concentration of SNAP f - b - tubu - lin in the cell lysate ( m m ) . The signal - to - noise ( S / N ) ratios were de - termined as S / N = ( I F (cid:2) I B ) / SD , where I F is the average fluorescence intensity , I B is the average background intensity , and SD is the stan - dard deviation of background . The signal - to - background ( S / B ) ratios were determined as S / B = I FT / I FNT , where I FT is the average fluorescence intensity of transfected U2OS cells and I FNT is the aver - age fluorescence intensity of nontransfected U2OS cells . Live cell labeling and imaging : Human embryonic kidney ( HEK 293 ) cells stably transfected with pSNAP f - EGFR were maintained at 37 8 C in phenol red - free DMEM medium supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) , penicillin ( 100 units per mL ) , streptomy - cin ( 100 m gmL (cid:2) 1 ) and G418 ( 200 m gmL (cid:2) 1 ) . Cells were seeded in Lab Tek II chambered coverglasses ( Nalge Nunc Int ) . At 24 h post - seed - ing , cell membrane - localized SNAP f - EGFR was labeled by incuba - tion of live HEK 293 cells stably expressing SNAP f - EGFR with SNAP - tag substrate ( 1 m m ) for 30 min at 37 8 C . Then SNAP - Surface Block ( New England Biolabs ) was added to the cells ( final concentration 20 m m ) to inhibit further labeling . Images were taken on a wide - field Axiovert 200 m Zeiss microscope using a 63(cid:3) objective and fixed exposure setting . Cell nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst 33342 . For imaging with medium removal , labeling was carried out as above , except that labeling medium was replaced with complete growth medium containing SNAP - Surface Block ( 20 m m ) . Images were processed using AxioVision 4 . 7 software . EGF - CLIP f isolation and labeling : Expression of recombinant EGF - CLIP f - His 6 was performed in SHuffle T7 E . coli ( New England Bio - labs ) . EGF - CLIP f - His 6 was purified from E . coli cell lysate using Ni - NTA Agarose ( Qiagen ) . Analysis of protein expression and purifica - tion was done with Coomassie Blue - stained SDS - PAGE . Labeling of EGF - CLIP f - His 6 was carried out with EGF - CLIP f - His 6 ( 40 m m ) , CLIP - Surface 488 ( 15 m m ) and DTT ( 1 m m ) in PBS on ice for 4 h . Colocalization of SNAP f - EGFR and EGF - CLIP f : HEK293 cells stably expressing SNAP f - EGFR were labeled with 5 m m CBG - 549 - QSY7 ( red ) at 25 8 C for 5 min . Cells were then incubated for 2 min with EGF - CLIP f labeled with CLIP - Surface 488 ( green ) at 500 ngmL (cid:2) 1 prior to imaging by confocal fluorescence microscopy . Cells were counterstained with Hoechst 33342 for nucleus ( blue ) . Images were acquired on a Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning confocal micro - scope using a 63X objective .
