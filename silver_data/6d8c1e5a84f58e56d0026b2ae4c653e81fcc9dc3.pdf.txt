INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY 41 : 2128 - 2138 , 2012 2128 Abstract . Cancer cells need to become motile in order to escape the primary tumor and move to distant areas to form metastasis . They move as single cells or as a group , following different stimuli , including growth factors . Among them , insulin - like growth factor - 1 ( IGF - 1 ) and epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) and their receptors have been implicated in the development and progression of human breast carcinoma . In this report , we provide evidence that the tyrosine kinase Src is responsible for migration promoted by both IGF - 1 and EGF in MDA - MB - 231 and MCF7 cells , although with a different effect . Moreover , both IGF - 1 and EGF induce reorganization of actin cytoskeleton in lamellipodia and membrane ruffles in a time - and Src - dependent manner . Furthermore , we analyzed the tyrosine phosphoryla - tion status of the actin - binding protein cortactin upon growth factor stimulation , showing that even the activation of cortactin is time - and Src - dependent . In addition , immunofluorescence analysis with anti - paxillin antibody reveals that , after treat - ment with growth factors , tyrosine phosphorylated cortactin is localized on the plasma membrane in correspondence of focal adhesions . Collectively , our findings suggest a crucial role for Src - mediated activation of cortactin in cell migration , reorga - nization of actin cytoskeleton and phosphotyrosine cortactin localization to the focal adhesions in human breast cancer cell lines upon both IGF - 1 and EGF stimulation . Introduction Metastasis is a complex process characterized by the detach - ment of cells from the primary tumor followed by their dissemination into surrounding tissues to form secondary tumors at distant sites , which is the most common cause of death for cancer patients ( 1 ) . Several types of molecules are involved in the metastatic process , including adhesion molecules , such as cadherins and integrins , various metallopro - teases , as well as growth factors and their receptors ( 2 ) . Cancer cells need to be motile in order to escape the tumor mass to form metastasis . They move in different ways : as a group or as single cells , adopting an elongated phenotype or moving in an ameboid shape ( 1 ) , depending on the organization of actin cytoskeleton . Among a variety of molecules involved in cell migration , cortactin plays a pivotal role . Discovered as a Src kinase substrate in RSV - transformed fibroblasts ( 3 ) , cortactin is a multidomain actin - binding protein ( 4 , 5 ) . The N - terminal half of the molecule includes the acidic domain ( NTA ) , responsible for the interaction with the Arp2 / 3 complex , and a tandem repeats containing the F - actin binding site . The C - terminal half is composed by an Î± - helical region , followed by a region rich in proline , serine and threonine , which harbors critical tyrosine residues , and finally an Src - homology 3 ( SH3 ) domain ( 6 ) . Cortactin is enriched at membrane ruffles and lamellipodia of several different cell types ( 4 ) , and plays a crucial role in regulating membrane dynamics and actin assembly for the control of membrane movements ( 5 ) . Furthermore , cortactin is reported to be overexpressed in many different tumor types . The cortactin gene EMS1 , located on chromosome 11q13 , is amplified in numerous human carcinomas ( 7 ) and is usually correlated with poor patient prognosis ( 8 ) . Moreover , cortactin can be activated by phosphorylation of tyrosines in position 421 , 466 and 482 by Src kinase after many different stimuli ( 9 ) . These properties of cortactin prompted us to examine its role in cell migration promoted by insulin - like growth factor - 1 ( IGF - 1 ) , one of the component of the IGF system , and the epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) in human breast cancer cell lines . Previous studies have demostrated that IGF - 1 is a physiolog - ical peptide , whose biological function is carried out following binding to its specific receptor ( IGF - 1R ) , a ubiquitous and multifunctional tyrosine kinase receptor ( 2 ) . Overexpression and activity of IGF - 1R have been associated with many different types of tumors , such as breast , prostate , lung , colon and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( 10 ) . The IGF - 1R is over - expressed in estrogen receptor ( ER ) - positive cells . These data are prominent because IGF - 1R has been implicated in different growth - related and growth - unrelated processes , critical for the development and progression of malignant tumors , such Involvement of the Src - cortactin pathway in migration induced by IGF - 1 and EGF in human breast cancer cells SILVIA MEZI 1 , LAURA TODI 2 , ERRICO ORSI 3 , ANTONIO ANGELONI 4 and PATRIZIA MANCINI 2 1 Department of Radiology , Oncology and Human Pathology , Division of Oncology B , 2 Department of Experimental Medicine , 3 Department of Surgical Science , Division of DEA , 4 Department of Molecular Medicine , Sapienza University of Rome , Rome , Italy Received June 21 , 2012 ; Accepted July 30 , 2012 DOI : 10 . 3892 / ijo . 2012 . 1642 Correspondence to : Dr Patrizia Mancini , Department of Experimental Medicine , Viale Regina Elena 324 , I - 00161 Rome , ItalyE - mail : patrizia . mancini @ uniroma1 . it Key words : cell migration , actin cytoskeleton , cortactin , Src , insulin - like growth factor - 1 , epidermal growth factor MEZI et al : Src - CORTACTIN ROLE IN BREAST CANCER CELL MIGRATION 2129 as proliferation , survival , and anchorage - independent growth , as well as cell adhesion , migration and invasion ( 11 , 12 ) . The activation of the IGF - 1R pathway promotes cell growth and counteracts the anticancer - induced apoptosis . Nevertheless , ER - negative tumors and cell lines , often exhibiting less differ - entiated , mesenchymal - like phenotypes , express low levels of IGF - 1R ( 11 , 13 , 14 ) . Notably , these cells do not respond to IGF - 1 with growth ( 11 , 15 - 18 ) . The lack of IGF - 1R pathway activation impaired the metastatic potential of ER - negative breast cancer cells by inhibiting both mitogenic response and migration in vitro and tumorigenesis in vivo ( 19 - 21 ) . The epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) is involved in various aspects of cell growth , survival , differentiation , migration and invasion ( 22 , 23 ) . EGFR is overexpressed in MDA - MB - 231 breast cancer cells , although the event is not due to gene amplification ( 24 ) , while MCF7 breast cancer cells lack EGFR - overexpression ( 25 ) . Here we analyzed the effect of IGF - 1 and EGF on the epidermal growth factor receptor - 2 ( ERB - B2 ) negative human invasive ductal breast carcinoma cell lines , MDA - MB - 231 and MCF7 ( 26 ) . The two cell lines differ in several cytological and biochemical parameters : MCF7 cells possess a functional ER , have an epithelial - like morphology and grow in colonies , whereas MDA - MB - 231 cells are ( ER ) - negative and proges - terone receptor ( PgR ) - negative and show a mesenchymal - like morphology and grow as a monostrate . Furthermore , MDA - MB - 231 cells exhibit strong invasive and metastatic capacities , and are representative of cells in late - stage breast cancer , while MCF7 are a poorly invasive and non - metastatic breast cancer cell line ( 27 ) . MCF7 have a characteristic luminal epithelial profile ( 27 , 28 ) , conversely MDA - MB - 231 shows a gene expression pattern similar to the claudin - low tumor subtype with the lowest expression of genes involved in epithe - lial cell - cell adhesion ( i . e . , E - cadherin and claudins 3 , 4 and 7 ) vs the other breast cancer phenotypes , low luminal differentia - tion ( i . e . , CD24 , EpCAM ) , and high values for the CD44 / CD24 and CD49f / EpCAM mRNA ratios ( 29 ) , and poor prognosis . The present study investigates the mechanism underlying the IGF - 1 mediated migration of human HER2 negative breast cancer cells , and all the experiments were performed comparing the results obtained by using IGF - 1 with those obtained by EGF . We demonstrate that both growth factors mediate : i ) the motogenic effect on the two cell lines , with a stronger effect of IGF - 1 on the claudin - low cell line , ii ) the actin cytoskeletal organization in typical migratory structures , iii ) the transloca - tion of the phospho - Y421 - cortactin to the focal adhesions , and we show that all these processes are Src - dependent .

The human breast cancer cell lines MDA - MB - 231 and MCF7 were cultured in Dulbecco ' s modified Eagle ' s medium ( DMEM , Euroclone , Pero , Italy ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum and antibiotics . For inhibition of Src specific family protein tyrosine kinases , cells were preincu - bated with SU6656 ( 30 ) , 5 ÂµM for 1 h , before incubation with IGF - 1 or EGF in the presence of the same inhibitor at 37ËC in pre - warmed medium . Scratch assay . MDA - MB - 231 and MCF7 cells were seeded at 5x10 5 and 1 . 2x10 6 cells on 35 - mm plates , respectively , and grown until confluence . Confluent cells were serum starved for 12 h and then a standardized cell - free area was introduced by scraping the monolayer with a sterile tip . After intensive washing , the remaining cells were incubated for 24 h in the presence of IGF - 1 ( 10 ng / ml ) or EGF ( 50 ng / ml ) . After incubation , the cells were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde for 30 min at 25ËC and photo - graphs were taken using an AxioObserver inverted microscope ( Carl Zeiss Inc . ) . Some plates were fixed and photographed immediately after scratching , representing a T0 control . For inhibition of Src family protein tyrosine kinases , cells were preincubated with SU6656 ( 5 ÂµM ) for 1 h before stimulation with the growth factors . The effects of growth factors and inhib - itor on cell migration was evaluated by measuring the distance remaining between the two sides of the scratch area , performed using Axio Vision software ( Carl Zeiss Inc . ) .

MDA - MB - 231 and MCF7 cells , grown on coverslips , were treated with IGF - 1 or EGF for 10 , 30 or 60 min , or pre - incubated with the Src inhibitor SU6656 for 1 h before adding the growth factors , as above . Cells were subse - quently fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde in phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) for 30 min at 25ËC , followed by treatment with 0 . 1 M glycine in PBS for 20 min at 25ËC and with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 in PBS for additional 5 min at 25ËC to allow permeabilization .

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY 41 : 2128 - 2138 , 2012 2130 Immunoprecipitation and western blot analysis . Subconfluent cultures of MDA - MB - 231 and MCF7 cells , treated with IGF - 1 or EGF and SU6656 , as above , were lysed in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 4 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 % NP - 40 , 1 mM EDTA , supplemented with protease inhibitors ( 10 Âµg / ml aprotinin , 10 Âµg / ml leupeptin , 2 mM PMSF ) , and phosphatase inhibitors ( 1 mM sodium orthovanadate , 20 mM sodium pyro - phosphate , 50 mM sodium fluoride ) . Î¤otal protein ( 50 Âµg ) was resolved under reducing conditions by 8 % SDS - PAGE and transferred to reinforced nitrocellulose ( Protran , Schleider and Schuell , Keene , NH , USA ) . The membrane was blocked with 5 % non - fat dry milk in PBS 0 . 1 % Tween - 20 , and incubated with anti - cortactin polyclonal antibodies diluted 1 : 1 , 000 , followed by enhanced chemiluminescence detection ( ECL ) . For the equal loading , the membrane was probed with anti - tubulin monoclonal antibody . For immunoprecipitation experiments , 1 mg of total protein from cell lysates , prepared as above , was incubated with 4 Âµg / ml anti - cortactin polyclonal antibodies . Immunocomplexes , aggregated with 50 Âµl of Î³ - bind protein - G sepharose ( Amersham Biosciences ) , were washed four times with 0 . 5 ml of buffer . The pellets were boiled in Laemmli buffer for 5 min , and the protein resolved under reducing conditions by 8 % SDS - PAGE and trans - ferred to reinforced nitrocellulose ( Protran ) . The membranes were blocked with 5 % non - fat dry milk in PBS 0 . 1 % Tween - 20 and incubated with anti - phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody diluted 1 : 1 , 000 for 1 h at 25ËC , followed by goat anti - mouse - HRP secondary antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence detection ( ECL , Amersham Biosciences , Arlington Heights , IL , USA ) . To estimate the protein equal loading , the membranes were rehydrated by being washed in PBS Tween - 20 , stripped with 100 mM mercaptoethanol and 2 % SDS for 30 min at 55ËC , and then reprobed with anti - cortactin polyclonal antibodies diluted 1 : 1 , 000 . Densitometric analysis was performed using Image J software . The signal intensity for each band was calculated and the background subtracted from experimental values . The resulting values were then normalized , expressed as fold increase with respect to the control value and visualized as a graph . Results IGF - 1 induces migration of breast cancer cells in a Src - dependent manner . In order to assess the motogenic effect of IGF - 1 on human breast cancer cells , we analyzed cell migration through scratch assay . To this aim , MDA - MB - 231 and MCF7 cells were seeded onto Petri dishes and allowed to grow to confluence . Then , a cell - free area was introduced in monolayers and cells were allowed to migrate from the edge of the scratch for 24 h in the presence of IGF - 1 . To better evaluate the effect of IGF - 1 , we used EGF as positive control for migration , as this growth factor has been shown to be strongly motogenic for cancer cell lines ( 31 , 32 ) . As shown in Fig . 1 , IGF - 1 displayed a stronger migratory effect on MDA - MB - 231 cells compared to MCF7 . On the other hand , EGF treatment induced a more evident migration on MCF7 with respect to MDA - MB - 231 ( Fig . 1 ) . Moreover , both the growth factors induced significant migration with respect to control untreated cells ( Fig . 1 ) . Since the protein tyrosine kinase Src has been previously shown to be involved in cell motility ( 33 ) , to evaluate the potential role of Src in regulating the migratory effect of IGF - 1 and EGF on MDA - MB - 231 and MCF7 cells , we performed the scratch assay , as above , in the presence of the selective Src family protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor , SU6656 ( 30 ) . Treatment with SU6656 was able to significantly prevent the migration of both the cancer cell lines upon either IGF - 1 and EGF stimulation ( Fig . 1 ) , thus suggesting the involvement of Src in this process . Taken together , these data indicate that both IGF - 1 and EGF stimulate migration of human cancer cells and strongly suggest a crucial role of Src in this process . IGF - 1 differentially affects migratory phenotype and actin reor - ganization in MDA - MB - 231 and MCF7 cells . Since the actin cytoskeleton reorganization in lamellipodia and membrane ruffles is a crucial step for cells to migrate ( 34 ) , here we analyzed the reorganization of actin cytoskeleton in human breast cancer cells upon IGF - 1 treatment . To this purpose , starved MDA - MB - 231 and MCF7 cells were stimulated with IGF - 1 or EGF at different time points , and stained with TRITC - phalloidin , that specifically recognizes filamentous actin cytoskeleton . Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that untreated MDA - MB - 231 cells exhibited a polygonal , enlarged and flat shape , with actin cytoskeleton mainly organized in stress fibers ( Fig . 2 , arrows , upper left panel ) , as previously described ( 35 ) . Upon treatment with IGF - 1 , MDA - MB - 231 cells showed actin reorganization in membrane ruffles and lamellipodia already after 10 min ( Fig . 2 , arrowheads , left panels ) , which were still present at 30 and 60 min ( Fig . 2 , arrowheads , left panels ) , althought after 60 min of treatment with IGF - 1 some stress fibers were also evident ( Fig . 2 , arrow , left panels ) . Moreover , cells displayed an elongated shape , which is the typical phenotype of migrating cells ( Fig . 2 , left panels ) . In contrast , the actin cytoskeleton organization in membrane ruffles and lamellipodia was evident after 30 and 60 min of stimula - tion with EGF ( Fig . 2 , arrowheads , left panels ) . whereas , after 10 min the actin cytoskeleton was organized mainly in stress fibers ( Fig . 2 , arrows , left panels ) and in some small lamellipodia and ruffles ( Fig . 2 , arrowheads , left panels ) . Furthermore , cells displayed phenotype that changes depending on time of treat - ment with EGF , being polygonal at 10 min , and elongated at 30 and 60 min of stimulation , showing a clear leading edge ( Fig . 2 , left panels ) . In the case of MCF7 , we focused our attention on cells that are localized at the periphery of colonies , because they are the ones that undergo migration . Untreated MCF7 showed clearly separated colonies with regular edges , and the actin mainly organized in well defined stress fibers ( Fig . 2 , arrows , upper right panel ) . Upon IGF - 1 treatment , MCF7 cells showed the actin cytoskeleton organized in membrane ruffles and lamel - lipodia , more evident at 30 and 60 min of stimulation , and only partially at 10 min ( Fig . 2 , arrowheads , left panels ) . The treat - ment with EGF induced reorganization of actin cytoskeleton in membrane ruffles and lamellipodia already after 10 min , which were less evident at 30 and 60 min of stimulation ( Fig . 2 , arrow - heads , left panels ) . Interestingly , in MCF7 cells both IGF - 1 and EGF induce reorganization of actin in a large array of lamel - lipodia , which remain confined throughout the cell cluster and do not extend beyond the edges of the cell colonies ( Fig . 2 , left panels ) . Moreover , after stimulation of both growth factors , cells at the periphery of MCF7 clusters showed a partially elongated cell shape , typical of cells that are separating from the colony ( Fig . 2 , left panels ) . Thus , a migratory phenotype was achieved by breast carcinoma cells after stimulation with both growth factors , but at different time points . To evaluate if the actin MEZI et al : Src - CORTACTIN ROLE IN BREAST CANCER CELL MIGRATION 2131 cytoskeleton reorganization in the cell lines that we assayed is dependent on Src activation , we performed parallel experiments in the presence of the Src inhibitor SU6656 . Results showed that SU6656 prevented both the migratory phenotype and the forma - tion of membrane ruffles and lamellipodia on MDA - MB - 231 and MCF7 cells ( Fig . 2 , right panels ) . Taken together , these results suggest that IGF - 1 and EGF are able to induce actin reorganiza - tion in human carcinoma cell lines , although the effect of IGF - 1 was more rapid and consistent in MDA - MB - 231 than in MCF7 cells , and that this process is Src - dependent . IGF - 1 induces rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin in breast cancer cells . Since one of the molecules involved in the reorganization of actin cytoskeleton is cortactin , an actin - binding protein , whose activity depends on tyrosine phosporylation mediated by the tyrosine kinase Src ( 6 ) , we evaluated the possible involvement of cortactin in human breast carcinoma cells upon IGF - 1 stimulation . To this purpose , we first determined the expression of cortactin in MDA - MB - 231 and MCF7 cells by western blot analysis . Cells were lysed and blotted with anti - cortactin antibodies , and the membrane was Figure 1 . IGF - 1 induces cell migration on human breast cancer cells in an Src - dependent manner . MDA - MB - 231 and MCF7 cells were seeded onto Petri dishes and allowed to grow until confluence . A cell - free area was introduced in monolayers , and then cells were immediately fixed ( T0 ) or allowed to migrate from the edge of the scratch for 24 h at 37ËC in the presence or not of IGF - 1 or EGF . IGF - 1 stimulation induces a more evident cell migration on MDA - MB - 231 cells than on MCF7 , while EGF is more motogenic on MCF7 with respect to MDA - MB - 231 . Treatment with SU6656 inhibits migration of both cancer cell lines upon either IGF - 1 and EGF stimulation , strongly suggesting the involvement of Src in this process . The images are representative of three independent experiments . Bar , 200 Âµm . Cell migration was quantified measuring the mean gap distance between the edges of the scratch area as reported in Materials and methods . Student ' s t - test was performed and significant differences are reported ( * * * p < 0 . 0001 ) . INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY 41 : 2128 - 2138 , 2012 2132 Figure 2 . IGF - 1 induces actin cytoskeleton reorganization and migratory phenotype on the two breast cancer cell lines in a different manner . MDA - MB - 231 and MCF7 cells were stimulated with IGF - 1 or EGF at 10 , 30 and 60 min , fixed , permeabilized and stained with TRITC - phalloidin to visualize the actin cytoskeleton organization . Untreated MDA - MB - 231 cells show a polygonal cell shape , with actin cytoskeleton mainly organized in stress fibers ( arrows ) . In MDA - MB - 231 , IGF - 1 induces actin organization in membrane ruffles and lamellipodia already after 10 min of stimulation ( arrowheads ) , still present at 30 and 60 min , during which some stress fibers are also evident ( arrow ) . Moreover , cells display a typical migratory phenotype . After 10 min of stimulation with EGF , actin cytoskeleton is organized mainly in stress fibers ( arrows ) and in membrane ruffles and lamellipodia after 30 min ( arrowheads ) , which were more evident at 60 min ( arrowheads ) . Furthermore , cells show a phenotype that changed depending on the time of stimulation , being at 10 min polygonal , and elongated at 30 and 60 min . Untreated MCF7 show clearly separated colonies with regular edges , and the actin mainly organized in well defined stress fibers ( arrows ) . Upon IGF - 1 stimulation , MCF7 cells display actin organized in membrane ruffles and lamellipodia , especially evident after 30 and 60 min of stimulation , and only partially at 10 min ( arrowheads ) . The treatment with EGF promotes formation of membrane ruffles and lamellipodia already after 10 min , which are less evident at 30 and 60 min ( arrowheads ) . After stimulation of both growth factors , cells at the periphery of MCF7 clusters display a partially elongated cell shape , typical of cells that are separating from the colony . In addition , in the presence of the Src inhibitor SU6656 the formation of membrane ruffles and lamellipodia on either MDA - MB - 231 and MCF7 cells was prevented , and the cells do not achieve a migratory phenotype . The images are representative of three independent experiments . Bars , 10 Âµm . MEZI et al : Src - CORTACTIN ROLE IN BREAST CANCER CELL MIGRATION 2133 Figure 3 . IGF - 1 induces tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin . ( A ) Expression of cortactin in MDA - MB - 231 and MCF7 cells by western blot analysis . Cells were lysed and blotted with anti - cortactin antibodies and the membrane was subsequently stripped and blotted with anti - Î± - tubulin antibody to assess the equal loading . A band corresponding to the protein cortactin is present in both the cell lines , although the amount of the protein expressed by MCF7 cells is greater than that exhibited by MDA - MB - 231 . Biochemical study of cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation in serum starved ( B ) MDA - MB - 231 and ( C ) MCF7 . Cells were treated with IGF - 1 or EGF at different time points , immunoprecipitated with anti - cortactin antibodies and immunoblotted with anti - phosphotyrosine antibody . In MDA - MB - 231 cells ( B ) , IGF - 1 stimulation induces a strong intensity level of tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin already evident after 10 min and still present at 30 and 60 min . Whereas , EGF stimulation promotes a lower intensity of tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin , with a peak after 30 min of treatment . In the case of MCF7 cells ( C ) , the highest point of the phosphorylation of the protein is found after 30 min of treatment with IGF - 1 , still present at 60 min , whereas , the treatment with EGF induces a good activation of cortactin already after 10 min , which decreases at 30 min and is virtually absent after 60 min of stimulation . The membranes were subsequently stripped and blotted with anti - cortactin antibodies to assess the equal loading . Parallel experiments performed in the presence of SU6656 , show that the Src inhibitor blocks tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin ( B and C ) . The intensity of the bands was evaluated by densitometric analysis ; the values from a representative experiment were normalized , expressed as fold increase with respect to the control value and reported as a graph ( A - C ) . INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY 41 : 2128 - 2138 , 2012 2134 subsequently stripped and blotted with anti - Î± - tubulin antibody to assess the equal loading . Results showed that both the human breast cancer cell lines expressed the protein cortactin , although MCF7 cells exhibited a greater amount of the protein with respect to that expressed by MDA - MB - 231 ( Fig . 3A ) , in keeping with previous reports ( 36 ) . To analyze the activation of cortactin , we performed a biochemical study of cortactin tyrosine phos - phorylation in serum starved MDA - MB - 231 and MCF7 cells , treated with IGF - 1 or EGF at different intervals of time , as reported in Materials and methods . Immunoprecipitation with anti - cortactin antibodies and immunoblot with anti - phosphoty - rosine antibody , demonstrated that in MDA - MB - 231 cells both IGF - 1 and EGF induced tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin , although IGF - 1 effect was already evident at 10 min , and was still present at 30 and 60 min of stimulation ( Fig . 3B , left panels ) . On the other hand , EGF induced a lower intensity of tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin , with a peak of phosphorylation after 30 min of treatment ( Fig . 3B , right panels ) . In MCF7 cells , the highest point of phosphorylation of the protein is found after 30 min of treatment with IGF - 1 , still present at 60 min ( Fig . 3C , left panels ) , whereas , the treatment with EGF led to a good activation of cortactin already after 10 min , which decreased at 30 min and was virtually absent after 60 min of stimula - tion ( Fig . 3C , right panels ) . Thus , both IGF - 1 and EGF were able to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin in breast cancer cells , althoug with a different intensity and kinetics , being IGF - 1 stronger , faster and lasting with respect to EGF in MDA - MB - 231 . To analyze if the activation of cortactin in the cellular models that we assayed is dependent on Src activity , we performed parallel experiments in the presence of SU6656 . The results showed that the Src inhibitor was able to block tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin ( Fig . 3B and C ) , as expected ( 37 ) , thus suggesting a direct involvement of Src in the activation of cortactin also in our cellular models . IGF - 1 induces translocation of tyrosine phosphorylated cortactin to the plasma membrane at sites of focal adhesion . Since we have previously shown that after KGF or FGF10 treat - ment , cortactin translocates to the plasma membrane of human keratinocytes in areas where actin is organized in ruffles and lamellipodia ( 37 ) , we wondered whether upon IGF - 1 treatment the activated phosphorylated cortactin translocates to the plasma membrane also in breast cancer cells . To this purpose , we first performed immunofluorescence analysis of cortactin localiza - tion in the cellular models assayed in the present study , using polyclonal antibodies directed against cortactin and , subse - quently , the TRITC - phalloidin to stain the filamentous actin cytoskeleton . Cells were treated with either IGF - 1 or EGF and observed at time points in which cortactin activation has been documented to be stronger , as described in experiments shown in Fig . 3 . Results demonstrated that in untreated MDA - MB - 231 and MCF7 cells the cortactin staining appeared mainly localized in the cytoplasm , with no localization at the plasma membrane ( Fig . 4 ) , as previously shown ( 37 ) . After stimulation with IGF - 1 for 10 min or EGF for 30 min , MDA - MB - 231 cells showed translocation of cortactin to the plasma membrane , in areas where actin is mainly organized in ruffles and lamel - lipodia ( Fig . 4 , arrowheads , left panels ) . Similar results were obtained in MCF7 cells after treatment with IGF - 1 for 30 min or EGF for 10 min ( Fig . 4 , arrowheads , right panels ) . Figure 4 . IGF - 1 promotes cortactin traslocation to the plasma membrane . MDA - MB - 231 and MCF7 cells were treated with IGF - 1 or EGF at different time points , fixed , permeabilized and stained with polyclonal antibodies directed against cortactin and the TRITC - phalloidin to stain the filamentous actin cytoskeleton . In untreated MDA - MB - 231 and MCF7 cells the cortactin labeling is mainly localized in the cytoplasm , with no localization to the plasma membrane . After stimula - tion with IGF - 1 for 10 min or EGF for 30 min , MDA - MB - 231 cells displayed translocation of cortactin to the plasma membrane , in areas where actin is mainly organized in ruffles and small lamellipodia ( arrowheads ) . Similar results were obtained in MCF7 cells after treatment with IGF1 for 30 min or EGF for 10 min ( arrowheads ) . The images are representative of three independent experiments . Bars , 10 Âµm . MEZI et al : Src - CORTACTIN ROLE IN BREAST CANCER CELL MIGRATION 2135 It has been shown that cortactin is phosphorylated at tyrosine residues Y421 , Y466 and Y482 ( 9 , 38 ) upon various signals , including growth factors ( 39 ) , and that this occurs in a sequential manner , the tyrosine position 421 being the first to be phosphorylated , and then tyrosine 466 and finally 482 ( 9 ) . In addition , cortactin phosphorylated on tyrosine 421 is found localized on lamellipodia ( 9 ) . Based on these observations , we wondered whether the cortactin form that translocates to the Figure 5 . Phospo - cortactin localizes to the focal adhesions . ( A ) Serum starved MDA - MB - 231 and MCF7 cells were treated with IGF - 1 or EGF at different time points , fixed , permeabilized and labeled with anti - cortactin monoclonal antibody and anti - pY421 cortactin polyclonal antibodies , which specifically recognize the cortactin phosphorylated on tyrosine in position 421 . Double immunofluorescence analysis show that in MDA - MB - 231 cells upon stimulation with IGF - 1 for 10 min or EGF for 30 min phospho - cortactin and cortactin colocalize on the plasma membrane ( arrowheads ) , whereas , in untreated cells no virtual colocalization between them is evident . Upon treatment with IGF - 1 for 30 min or EGF for 10 min , even in the case of MCF7 cells , cortactin colocalizes with the phosphorylated form of cortactin on the plasma membrane ( arrowheads ) , whereas no virtual colocalization is observed in untreated cells . Parallel experiments performed in the presence of SU6656 demonstrate that there are neither translocation of cortactin nor staining of phospho - cortactin on the plasma membrane . ( B ) Serum starved MDA - MB - 231 and MCF7 cells were stimulated with IGF - 1 or EGF , fixed , permeabilized and incubated with anti - paxillin monoclonal antibody to reveal paxillin , a component of the focal adhesions and with anti - pY421 - cortactin to reveal the phospho - cortactin . In untreated MDA - MB - 231 and MCF7 cells , paxillin staining is present on the plasma membrane ( arrowheads ) , whereas the labeling of phospho - cortactin is not . After IGF - 1 treatment for 10 min or EGF for 30 min , in MDA - MB - 231 cells colocalization of phospho - cortactin with paxillin at the plasma membrane is evident ( arrowheads ) . Similar results are obtained in MCF7 cells , upon stimulation with IGF - 1 for 30 min or EGF for 10 min ( arrowheads ) . SU6656 is able to prevent the movement of pY421 cortactin to the focal adhesions , whereas the staining of paxillin is regular ( arrowheads ) .

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY 41 : 2128 - 2138 , 2012 2136 plasma membrane upon IGF - 1 and EGF stimulation , is the one phosphorylated on tyrosine in position 421 in our cellular models . To this purpose , we performed double immunofluorescence analysis using anti - cortactin monoclonal antibody and anti - pY421 cortactin polyclonal antibodies , that specifically recognize the cortactin phosphorylated on tyrosine in position 421 . Results obtained showed that in MDA - MB - 231 cells upon stimulation with IGF - 1 for 10 min or EGF for 30 min , phospho - cortactin colocalized with cortactin on the plasma membrane , where it was translocated ( Fig . 5A , arrowheads , upper panels ) , whereas , in untreated cells no colocalization between phosphorylated and normal cortactin was evident on the plasma membrane ( Fig . 5A , upper panels ) . Also in MCF7 cells , after stimulation with IGF - 1 for 30 min or EGF for 10 min , cortactin colocalized with the phosphorylated form of the protein on the plasma membrane ( Fig . 5A , arrowheads , lower panels ) , as previously demon - strated ( 40 ) , whereas no colocalization was observed in untreated cells ( Fig . 5A , lower panels ) . The presence of SU6656 showed that there were neither translocation of cortactin nor staining of phospho - cortactin on the plasma membrane ( Fig . 5A , upper and lower panels ) . Since the cortactin translocated to the plasma membrane appeared at specific sites which resembled focal adhesion , we focused our attention on paxillin , a component of focal adhesions , with a role in cell migration ( 41 ) . Serum starved MDA - MB - 231 and MCF7 cells were stimulated with IGF - 1 or EGF , fixed , permeabilized and incubated with anti - paxillin monoclonal antibody to reveal paxillin , and with anti - pY421 - cortactin to reveal the phospho - cortactin . In untreated MDA - MB - 231 and MCF7 cells the labeling of phospho - cortactin was not present at the plasma membrane ( Fig . 5B , upper and lower panels ) , whereas the staining of paxillin was evident at the periphery of the cells ( Fig . 5B , arrowheads , upper and lower panels ) . After IGF - 1 treatment for 10 min or EGF for 30 min , MDA - MB - 231 cells showed an evident colocalization of phospho - cortactin with paxillin in correspondence of focal adhesions ( Fig . 5B , arrowheads , upper panels ) . Also in the case of MCF7 cells stimulation with IGF - 1 for 30 min or EGF for 10 min induced the localization of pY421 - cortactin at the plasma membrane where paxillin was evident ( Fig . 5B , arrow - heads , lower panels ) . The presence of SU6656 inhibited the localization of pY421 cortactin to the focal adhesions , whereas the staining of paxillin was regular ( Fig . 5B , arrowheads , upper and lower panels ) . Taken together , these results indicate that IGF - 1 and EGF were able to induce translocation of pY421 - cortactin to the plasma membrane at the focal adhesions , where it colocalizes with paxillin . Moreover , the employment of SU6656 strongly suggest a direct involvement of Src in this process . Discussion The rationale of our investigation on IGF - 1 and EGF - dependent migration and on the pathways involved in ER - negative and ER - positive breast cancer cell lines , is that the migration of cancer cells greatly contribute to their metastatic potential , that is the major clinical threat in cancer patients . Overexpression and acti - vation of IGF - 1R have been associated with some different aspects of the progression in cancer ( 10 ) . Several studies indicate that in breast cancer , both IGF - 1 and EGF are involved in the processes of cell adhesion , invasion and anchorage - independent growth that finally lead to the migration and metastatic spreading ( 19 - 23 ) . Both IGF - 1R and EGFR activate common downstream signaling pathways , meanly those involving MAP kinase and Akt . IGF - 1R functions are predominantly mediated through IGF - 1 - induced activation of the phosphoinositide 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) - AKT , RAS - RAF - MAPK and p38 MAPK signaling cascades ( 42 ) . The cooperativity between Src and EGFR , as well as other motogenic receptors , is well established ( 43 ) , and a variety of docking proteins that contain Src homology - 2 ( SH2 ) and phosphotyrosine binding ( PTB ) domains , bind the intracellular domains of the activated receptors ( 44 ) . Our study demonstrates that both IGF - 1 and EGF induce a significant effect on migration of human breast cancer cells . IGF - 1 treatment of MDA - MB - 231 cells resulted in significantly enhanced cell migration . The effect is earlier , stronger and steadier , when compared to the EGF and untreated control cells under the same experimental conditions . The effect of EGF , with respect to IGF - 1 treatment , on ER - positive MCF7 cells in inducing cell migration is , on the contrary , greater . Our results are consistent with those obtained by Bae et al ( 45 ) , who concluded that the motogenic effect of IGF - 1 does not induce a motile phenotype on MCF7 cell line , and with those of Jackson et al ( 46 ) , who showed that IGF - 1 stimulated the migration of MDA - MB - 231 cells . Moreover , we are in agreement also with Tong et al ( 47 ) , who observed that EGF produced a chemoat - tractant effect in estrogen receptor ( ER ) - positive MCF - 7 cells , whereas in ER - negative MDA - MB - 231 breast cancer cells , EGF produced very little invasive activity . All these observations are consistent with the view that the expression level of IGF - 1R , as well as that of EGFR , are important in controlling cellular responses in terms of migration to both the growth factors . This scenario has been strenghten by the demonstration that the knockdown of the IGF - 1R decreases the migration stimulated by IGF - 1 in MCF7 and MDA - MB - 231 cells ( 48 ) . These data strongly suggest a cell specific ability of the motogenic receptor to modulate the migratory potential of breast cancer cells . The modulation of cell motility and cell adhesion , that is essential for metastasis , arises as a result of changes in the cytoskeletal architecture ( 49 , 50 ) . Engagement or activation of cell surface growth factors and adhesion receptors affects the assembly and arrangement of F - actin networks ( 51 , 52 ) , and the cell shape . In a previous paper , DePasquale ( 53 ) showed that the treatment of MCF7 cells with estrogen induces a reorgani - zation of the actin cytoskeleton in a complex arrangement of lamellipodia that is actively motile . In line with this report is our observation that in MCF7 cells both IGF - 1 and EGF induce reorganization of actin in a large array of lamellipodia , which remains confined throughout the cell clusters and do not extend beyond the edges of the cell colonies , suggesting that the cells at the periphery of the colonies move all together along the direc - tion of migration . Moreover , we found that MDA - MB - 231 cells show typical migratory features and an evident motile phenotype upon both IGF - 1 and EGF treatment , although the effect of IGF - 1 is more rapid than that of EGF , reflecting the behavior of cells in terms of migration . Cortactin has been shown to enhance lamellipodial persistence and the rate of adhesion formation in lamel - lipodia , consistent with an important function in regulating directed cell motility ( 54 ) . As reported by Wang et al ( 55 ) , we MEZI et al : Src - CORTACTIN ROLE IN BREAST CANCER CELL MIGRATION 2137 demonstrate that upon IGF - 1 stimulation , cortactin is tyrosine phosphorylated at Y421 and translocates to the focal adhe - sions , where it colocalizes with paxillin . This finding may explain the observed phenotype and these changes in local F - actin dynamics may regulate cell motility . Our data show that the inhibition of Src abolishes IGF - 1 - and EGF - mediated migration in both ER - positive and ER - negative cells . We demonstrated that the motogenic effect and the switch in the phosphorylation state of cortactin is Src signaling - depen - dent , as shown by using the selective Src - inhibitor SU6656 . In our model system , MDA - MB - 231 cells , which have a high invasive potential , the translocation of phospho - cortactin to the focal adhesion is IGF - 1 - dependent , and Src is necessary , because tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin is linked to Src activity , as previously shown ( 3 , 56 , 57 ) . The initial accumulation of the post - translational activated cortactin and actin , is poten - tially involved in the clinical aggressiveness of both ER - positive and ER - negative breast carcinoma , because actin polymeriza - tion at the leading edge provides the protrusive force required for the extension of lamellipodia observed during cell motility and spreading ( 58 ) . In agreement with Liu and Feng ( 59 ) , our data suggest the Src inhibition as a potential clinical therapeutic strategy for Her2 - negative breast cancer patients , but the treat - ment approach and the combination with chemotherapy needs to be further elucidated . We also showed that the expression level of cortactin is different in the two cell lines , being higher in MCF7 , according to their molecular subtype characteristic of luminal epithelial phenotype ( 27 , 28 ) , compared to MDA - MB - 231 . Our data are in agreement with a previous report in which a profile of the level of cortactin expression was assessed in a panel of breast cancer cells related to the different degree of EMS1 gene amplification ( 36 ) , and with the reduced epithelial properties of MDA - MB - 231 cells according to their gene expression pattern , similar to the claudin - low tumor subtype with a strong tendency to mesenchymal transition , and a low expression of genes involved in epithelial cell - cell adhesion ( 29 ) . Epithelial cells are characterized by the formation of intercellular junctions , which connect and immobilize adjacent cells . Cortactin is reported to be involved in the formation of adhesion junc - tions after recruitment to cell - cell adhesive contacts , and it is recruited in response to homophilic cadherin liga - tion ( 60 ) . Recently , it has been reported that inhibition of cortactin enhanced the expression of fibronectin , a specific mesenchymal marker , and accelerated TGF - Î² 1 - induced EMT , indicating that cortactin is involved in maintaining the epithelial properties of cells ( 61 ) . Based on these observa - tions and on the results of this study , we speculate that also in our cellular models the basal level of cortactin is related to a potential function in maintaining epithelial properties in Her2 - negative breast cancer cells . In addition , we observed that cortactin is tyrosine phos - phorylated by IGF - 1 and EGF with different amplitude and kinetics , IGF - 1 is stronger and faster than EGF in activating this protein in MDA - MB - 231 cells . Whereas , in MCF7 cells , EGF - induced activation of cortactin appears to be more intense than that of IGF - 1 . We hypothesize that these differences in the expression , kinetics , magnitude and duration of cortactin tyro - sine phosphorylation can account for the discrepancies between IGF - 1 and EGF in promoting cell migration . Collectively , our study underlines the multipotential proper - ties of the actin - binding protein cortactin in tumor cell migration , and , in conclusion , suggests that the IGF - 1 / EGF - Src - cortactin pathway dependent enhancement of cell motility leads to a motile phenotype , and determines the formation of cancer cells which are migratory and invasive , hallmarks of cells that have the potential to generate metastases .
