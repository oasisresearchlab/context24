Hence such domains are distinct from the remaining membrane by their lipid structure ( liquid - ordered vs . - disordered domains ) . Here , we di - rectly visualize membrane lipid structure of living cells by using two - photon microscopy . In macrophages , liquid - ordered domains are particularly enriched on membrane protrusions ( ﬁlopodia ) , adhesion points and cell – cell contacts and cover 10 – 15 % of the cell surface at 37°C . By deconvoluting the images , we demonstrate the existence of phase separation in vivo . We compare the properties of microscopically visible domains ( < 1 (cid:1) m 2 ) , with those of isolated detergent - resistant membranes and provide evidence that mem - brane coverage by lipid rafts and their ﬂuidity are principally governedbycholesterolcontent , therebyprovidingstrongsupport for the lipid raft hypothesis . membrane domains (cid:1) macrophages T he lipid raft hypothesis proposes that the lateral organization of cellular membranes is based on the presence of distinct , cholesterol - rich , rigid domains ( rafts ) ( 1 ) , which are involved in signal transduction ( 2 ) , protein sorting , and membrane transport ( 3 , 4 ) . Our understanding of lipid structure and the formation of specific lipid domains within membranes , however , is almost exclusively based on model membrane systems ( 5 ) . Although phase separation of domains of liquid - ordered structure is predicted to exist in cellular membranes ( 6 , 7 ) , direct demon - stration using methodologies such as fluorescence quenching has been difficult to apply to living cells ( 8 ) . The evidence for the existence of lipid rafts in living cells is largely based on mea - surements of the clustering ( 9 , 10 ) or diffusion ( 11 , 12 ) of lipid raft proteins , which are secondary to the lipid organization . In the present study , we labeled living cells with the fluores - cent probe 6 - acyl - 2 - dimethylaminonapthalene ( Laurdan ) , which has been previously used to characterize domain formation and phase separation in model membranes using phospholipid mix - tures ( 13 – 15 ) or lipid extracted from cellular membranes ( 16 – 18 ) . Laurdan is an environmentally sensitive fluorescence probe that exhibits a 50 - nm red shift as membranes undergo phase transition from gel to fluid , due to altered water penetration into the lipid bilayer ( 19 ) . Its dipole is aligned parallel to the hydrophobic lipid chains in membranes and is located in both bilayers ( 20 ) . The probe’s fluorescence in water is negligible , and it is not influenced spectroscopically by surface modifications such as lipoprotein binding ( 20 , 21 ) . The environmentally in - duced red shift allows the translation of intensity measurements at different wavelengths into lipid packing orders within the membranes of intact and living cells ( 20 , 22 , 23 ) . Generalized polarization ( GP ) , with a correcting factor G for the experimen - tal setup , is defined analogously to fluorescence polarization by measuring the intensities ( I ) between 400 and 460 nm and 470 and 530 nm : GP (cid:1) I ( 400 – 460 ) (cid:2) G (cid:1) I ( 470 – 530 ) I ( 400 – 460 ) (cid:3) G (cid:1) I ( 470 – 530 ) . [ 1 ] GP values range from – 1 ( most fluid ) to (cid:3) 1 ( most condensed ) membranes and are independent of local probe concentrations . Laurdan distributes equally into fluid or condensed membranes and does not associate itself with specific fatty acids or phos - pholipid head groups ( 20 ) ; GP values therefore reflect the overall membrane structure and not a specific lipid or protein composition ( 22 ) . Lipid order can be visualized by its effect on the spectroscopic properties of Laurdan , and deconvolution of the GP distribution gives additional quantitative structural in - formation . Lipid phase boundaries for GP values were estimated by using liposomes with compositions similar to those of cellular membranes ( 17 , 24 ) . In liposomes with equal molar ratios of dioleoylphosphatidylcholine ( DOPC ) , cholesterol , and sphingo - myelin , GP values of (cid:4) 0 . 55 and (cid:5)(cid:2) 0 . 05 represent membranes in gel and fluid phase , respectively ( 17 ) . Moreover , distinct liquid - disordered (cid:2) nonraft domains ( 0 . 25 (cid:5) GP (cid:5) (cid:2) 0 . 05 ) and liquid - ordered (cid:2) raft domains ( 0 . 55 (cid:4) GP (cid:4) 0 . 25 ) , which are inter - mediate between gel and fluid phases , are also identified in liposomes . Separation of liquid - ordered and - disordered phases at GP values between 0 . 2 and 0 . 3 has also been shown with other phospholipid mixtures ( 13 – 15 ) . Methods Cells .

No nonspecific binding or crossreaction between secondary mouse and rabbit antibodies was observed . Where indicated , cells were treated with 0 – 10 mM methyl (cid:3) - cyclodextrin ( mCD , Sigma ) for 0 – 1 h at 22°C or 37°C in media with 1 mg (cid:2) ml BSA ( essentially fatty acid free , Sigma ) . Crosslinking of fibroblasts used 0 . 5 mM BS 3 [ bis ( sulfosuccinimidyl ) suberate , Pierce , Dorra , Australia ] at 4°C for 45 min in PBS ( 27 ) . For patching of domains , living fibroblasts were treated with mouse antitransferrin receptor ( 1 : 100 ) in DMEM with 2 mg (cid:2) ml BSA for 45 min at 10°C , washed , and incubated with donkey anti - mouse IgG ( 1 : 100 ) in DMEM with 2 mg (cid:2) ml BSA for 45 min at 10°C ( 28 ) . Lipid raft isolation used postnuclear supernatants of whole - cell homogenate ( 15 (cid:6) 10 6 cells ) or purified plasma membranes ( 50 (cid:6) 10 6 cells ) ( 29 ) . Samples were sonicated for 30 sec ( whole - cell homogenate ) or 120 sec ( plasma membranes ) with a high - power output probe sonicator or treated with detergent for 30 min on ice ( 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 or 0 . 2 % Lubrol WX ) and separated on a 45 – 5 % sucrose gradient ( 16 h at 198 , 000 (cid:6) g av in a swing - out rotor ( SW41 , Beckman Coulter ) as described ( 30 ) . Rafts were collected at densities of 1 . 060 – 1 . 090 g (cid:2) ml and nonraft material at 1 . 150 – 1 . 180 g (cid:2) ml . Microscopy . Images were obtained with a DM IRE2 Microscope ( Leica , Gladesville , Australia ) . Laurdan fluorescence was ex - cited with a mode - locked titanium – sapphire laser ( Verdi (cid:2) Mira 900 , Coherent Radiation , Palo Alto , CA ) . Two - photon intensity input was regulated with an amplitude modulator linked to the Leica software system . For living cells a (cid:6) 63 water objective , numerical aperture ( NA ) (cid:1) 1 . 2 and for fixed cells a (cid:6) 100 oil objective , NA (cid:1) 1 . 4 was used . To record intensities at selective wavelengths , internal photon multiplier tubes collected images in an eight - bit , unsigned images with 512 (cid:6) 512 pixels at a 400 - Hz scan speed . Laurdan intensity images were recorded simulta - neously with emission in the range of 400 – 460 nm and 470 – 530 nm for the two channels , respectively . The relative sensitivity of the two channels was determined with 0 . 5 (cid:2) M Laurdan in DMSO for each experiment and the G - factor calculated . For confocal microscopy , a helium - neon laser ( green and blue ) line was used to excite Cy3 [ excitation ( Ex ) : 543 nm ; emission ( Em ) : 550 – 620 nm ] and Cy5 ( Ex : 633 nm , Em 650 – 720 nm ) with appropriate cutoff filters and minimal pinhole widths .

All image calculations were carried out in floating point format and images converted into eight - bit unsigned images for presentation using the imaging software WIT . The GP was calculated for each pixel using the two Laurdan intensity images ( I 400 – 460 and I 470 – 530 ) . GP images ( as eight - bit unsigned images ) were pseudocolored in Adobe PHOTOSHOP ( Adobe Systems , Mountain View , CA ) and stacks of GP images ( 50 – 100 slices ) reconstructed in VOXVIEW . Background values ( defined as intensities below 7 % of the maximum intensity ) were set to zero and colored black . GP distributions were obtained from the histograms of the GP images ( or stacks of images ) and fitted to one or two Gauss distributions by using the nonlinear fitting algorithm ( Microsoft EXCEL ) .

G factor had (cid:5) 2 % variation across the imaging area . For comparison with GP images , confocal images were con - verted to binary images ( with background value set to zero and above - background intensities set to one ) and multiplied with the corresponding GP image . The histogram of these multiplied images was regarded as the GP distribution of the confocal images . GP values of confocal images could not be corrected , because the G factor for fixed cells in mounting fluid and residual paraformaldehyde could not be accurately determined . Results and Discussion Laurdan - stained macrophage images were collected at different focal depths and GP images calculated as described above . Fig . 1 shows pseudocolored GP images of RAW264 . 7 ( mouse ; Fig . 1 A ) and THP - 1 ( human ; Fig . 1 B ) macrophages that have been reconstructed to a 3D image from 50 – 100 images . The GP images , as well as distribution of GP values ( Fig . 1 C ) , clearly show nonarbitrary differences in GP values across the cell surface . RAW264 . 7 macrophages exhibit knob - like membrane protrusions that colocalize with areas of high GP , indicating condensed , possibly raft - like domains . These membrane evagi - nations are also found on THP - 1 macrophages but here , long slender filopodia are more common . These surface morpholo - gies , cell - to - cell contacts , and possibly adhesion points ( Fig . 1 B ) are also enriched with high GP domains . Primary hMDMs also display high GP filopodia but also have membrane invaginations that do not always colocalize with high GP domains ( data not shown ) . Studies with liposomes have established that membranes with high curvature have lower GP values , i . e . , appear more fluid than membrane areas with lesser curvature ( 15 ) . Hence the high GP values we observe at filopodia , adhesion points , and cell – cell contact points most likely reflect the condensed structure of the membrane , not altered curvature . Areas enriched in high GP domains are from several hundred nanometers to micrometers in diameter . Lipid raft size estimates are controversial , with suggested sizes varying from 30 to 50 nm ( 12 ) to several micrometers ( 11 ) ; different techniques , cell types , and molecules tagged and tracked could account for the con - siderable differences . Two - photon fluorescence microscopy has limitation in spatial resolution ( 183 nm at 800 nm ) and is not capable of visualizing individual rafts of previously predicted diameter . However , discrimination between high vs . low GP domains indicates either that individual small rafts cluster in certain membrane morphologies or that lipid raft size in mac - rophages has previously been underestimated . When living or fixed fibroblasts are imaged ( Fig . 2 A and B ) , some , but relatively few , high GP domains at cell – cell contact points are seen . More high GP domains are revealed when fibroblasts are crosslinked nonspecifically ( Fig . 2 D ) or patched with specific antibodies ( Fig . 2 E ) as described ( 27 , 28 ) . Crosslinking of either raft or nonraft membrane proteins causes coalescence of common lipid mi - crodomains , segregating larger areas of both raft and nonraft domains on the plasma membrane ( 28 ) . Disruption of lipid rafts ( 10 mM mCD at 37°C for 1 h ) causes complete loss of high GP domains ( Fig . 2 C ) , and remaining domains cannot be revealed by patching ( Fig . 2 F ) , as reported ( 31 ) , but contrary to the findings by Hao et al . ( 32 ) . Studies of protein diffusion in and out of rafts suggest that these domains are highly dynamic , although some raft compo - nents have residence times of several minutes ( 12 ) . Domains of high GP in macrophages were stable for at least 30 sec at room temperature , thereby allowing intensity images to be averaged . Surface area covered by lipid raft domains has been difficult to Table 2 .

Prior et al . ( 33 ) , using immunogold electron microscopy , estimated that 35 % of the cell surface is covered by rafts with a mean diameter of 44 nm . We deconvo - luted the histograms of stacks of GP images to obtain two populations of high and low GP ( Fig . 1 C ) . The number of pixels associated with a given GP is an indication of the surface area of that population . The estimation of surface coverage is likely to be most accurate for macrophages , where domains of high GP values cluster to reach sizes above the resolution limit of the microscope ( 183 nm ) in specific membrane morphologies . In other cells , such as fibroblasts , where clustering of visible lipid raft - rich regions may be less pronounced , deconvolution of the GP images may underestimate the surface area covered by lipid rafts . High GP populations in macrophages cover on average 29 – 44 % of the cells’ surface . Table 1 gives the mean values of the two GP populations , together with the widths ( half width of half maximum ) of their Gaussian distributions . The GP data clearly indicate a coexistence of liquid phases in macrophage membrane with separation at GP values of 0 . 3 – 0 . 4 . A compar - ison with liposomes [ 1 : 1 : 1 dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (cid:2) cholesterol (cid:2) sphingomyelin ( 17 ) ] suggests a coexistence of liquid - disordered membranes ( lower GP population ) and liquid - ordered membranes ( higher GP population ) , although phase separation in these liposomes is lower ( at GP (cid:9) 0 . 3 ) than found here . GP values for phase separation in cells and liposomes are expected to differ for two main reasons . First , cellular membrane order is probably affected by membrane proteins , which are absent in model systems . Second , measurements in liposomes are conducted in thermodynamic equilibrium , whereas in cells , there is a constant turnover of lipids and proteins . In our experiments with living cells , there is some overlap between the two main GP distributions resulting from broader population widths ( see also Fig . 1 B ) . This is distinct from model membranes , where , at room temperature , domains and populations are well separated with population widths of 0 . 15 – 0 . 25 . The temperature dependency of GP populations is well documented in model systems ( 13 – 15 , 17 ) . The overlap between populations could reflect raft heter - ogeneity , with rafts of different structure and fluidity obscuring clear separation . Raft lipid heterogeneity has been proposed to explain the differential detergent insolubility of proteins ( 34 , 35 ) , but little is known of the lipid composition and structure of various raft populations . Further , the scatter in the data does not allow a deconvolution into more than two populations . Mean values and surface coverage of high GP domains were also temperature - dependent ( Fig . 1 D ) . As expected , with in - creasing temperature , all membranes become more fluid . In fact , mean values of both populations decreased in parallel so that the fluidity difference between the two populations is maintained at physiological temperatures . Slopes of – 0 . 0112 (cid:2) °C and (cid:2) 0 . 0132 (cid:2) °C were determined for the centers of low and high GP population , respectively , when fitted to a linear regression line ( R 2 for linear fit , and sigmoidal fitting curves are very similar ) . These values agree very well with the temperature dependency of GP values in artificial membranes that mimic cellular mem - brane lipid composition ( slopes – 0 . 008 (cid:2) °C to – 0 . 012 (cid:2) °C , data not shown ) and with the GP values of isolated lipid rafts or nonraft domains ( Table 2 ) , validating the deconvolution of the living cells . Surface coverage of the high GP population de - creased rapidly with increasing temperature , so that at 37°C , the coverage by lipid raft - like domains was 10 – 15 % . This surprising finding may reflect a decrease in individual raft size , or in raft abundance , or that rafts disperse to smaller more mobile units below the time and spatial resolution of the two - photon microscope . With a liquid - ordered structure , the question remains whether a high GP population comprises or is identical to ‘‘lipid rafts . ’’ Rafts are usually separated by extraction with either detergents or sonication and isolated by density gradient centrifugation . Some membrane proteins are characteristically associated with ( caveolin - 1 , caveolin - 2 , flotillin - 1 ) or excluded from ( transferrin receptor ) the buoyant rafts , although varying isolation methods , particularly detergents , generate rafts with various protein com - positions ( 35 ) . We evaluated the colocalization of some proteins with GP domains in paraformaldehyde - fixed (cid:2) saponin - permeabilized cells . It should be noted that fixation (cid:2) permeabilization does alter lipid structure ; it decreases the surface coverage of the high GP domains ( Table 1 ) . Schuck et al . Fig . 4 .

( 36 ) have shown that treatment with saponin can decrease the buoyancy of raft protein similar to cyclodextrin treatment , suggesting that permeabilization may alter raft structure ( 36 ) . We used single - photon confocal immunofluorescent images to mask the GP images of the fixed cells ( visualized in Fig . 3 ) and deconvoluted the resulting GP population to a single Gaussian distribution ( Table 2 ) . The widths of these immunostained populations are broad due to the spatial limitation of the confocal microscopy ( 37 ) . The GP populations of caveolin - 1 and transferrin receptor most clearly segregate with the high and low GP domains of fixed RAW264 . 7 cells , respectively . ABCA - 1 , which is Triton - soluble but partially Lubrol - insoluble , has GP populations between the two means ( 0 . 17 (cid:5) GP (cid:5) 0 . 42 ) , giving further evidence of raft heterogeneity ( see also GP values of Lubrol - insoluble membranes in Table 2 ) . Furthermore , GP values of isolated rafts are in good agreement with the mean values found microscopically ( Table 1 ) , thereby validating iden - tification of rafts by microscopy . Although the dependency of raft structure on cholesterol is frequently assumed , the effect of removing or adding cholesterol by agents such as cyclodextrins has not been directly determined in living cells . Here we assess the effect of mCD on raft cholesterol content ( Table 2 ) and raft structure in living RAW 264 . 7 cells ( Fig . 4 ) . Even at low concentration ( 1 . 0 mg (cid:2) ml ) , where only 9 . 5 (cid:8) 1 . 2 % of total cell cholesterol is removed after 10 min at 22°C , the morphology of the macrophages changes rapidly . The cells lose their characteristic membrane protrusions , and surface coverage of the high GP population falls ( from 44 % to 37 % ) , and its mean raft GP shifts to more fluid values ( from 0 . 52 to 0 . 39 , Table 1 ; a statistically significant shift in population with P (cid:5) 0 . 05 ) . Small high GP areas ( GP (cid:9) 0 . 5 – 0 . 6 , area 3 – 5 (cid:2) m 2 , circled in Fig . 4 A ) decrease in GP [ – 0 . 036 ( (cid:8) 0 . 011 ) min (cid:2) 1 ] more rapidly than low GP ( GP (cid:1) 0 . 08 – 0 . 13 ) areas [ – 0 . 0066 ( (cid:8) 0 . 009 ) min (cid:2) 1 ] , suggesting that lipid raft structure is altered more severely than nonraft domains . Conversely , increasing cell cholesterol with cholesterol - complexed mCD ( 0 . 5 mg (cid:2) ml for 1 h , 1 . 3 - fold increase in cell cholesterol ) caused an increase in raft coverage but no alteration in mean GP values . Morphologically , short - term incubations with cholesterol - complexed mCD in - creased the number of high GP - enriched filopodia and cell – cell contact points . These data demonstrate that raft coverage and membrane fluidity in living cells are cholesterol - and temperature - dependent , and that rafts appear to associate with specific cellular structures such as filopodia . Direct microscopic visual - ization is uniquely placed to determine cellular mechanisms that govern lipid raft structure and their physiological roles . GP values of living cells may not always directly correspond to those obtained in artificial membrane systems . However , comparisons of GP values within cells clearly establish fluidity differences within the plasma membrane , and comparisons before and after treatments allow an insight into raft maintenance . At this time , GP images cannot replace traditional microscopy or biochemical lipid raft characterization but can facilitate studies of lipid rafts on living cells . K .
