Jenness * Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology , University of Massachusetts Medical School , Worcester , Massachusetts 01655 Submitted May 16 , 2000 ; Revised June 22 , 2000 ; Accepted June 23 , 2000 Monitoring Editor : Howard Riezman a - Factor receptors from Saccharomyces cerevisiae are G - protein - coupled receptors containing seven transmembrane segments . Receptors solubilized with the detergent n - dodecyl b - d - maltoside were found to sediment as a single 8S species in glycerol density gradients . When the membranes from cells coexpressing two differentially tagged receptors were solubilized with detergent and sub - jected to immunoprecipitation , we found that the antibodies speciﬁc for either epitope tag resulted in precipitation of both tagged species . Coprecipitation was not a consequence of incomplete detergent extraction because the abundant plasma membrane protein Pma1 did not coprecipitate with the receptors . Moreover , the receptor complexes were present prior to detergent extraction because coimmunoprecipitation was not observed when cells expressing the single tagged species were mixed prior to membrane preparation . Treatment of cultures with a - factor had little effect on the extent of oligomerization as judged by the sedimentation behavior of the receptor complexes and by the efﬁciency of coimmunoprecipitation . The ability of receptor complexes to undergo ligand - mediated endocytosis was evaluated by using membrane fractionation and ﬂuorescence microscopy . Mutant receptors that fail to bind a - factor ( Ste2 - S184R ) or lack the endocytosis signal ( Ste2 - T326 ) became competent for ligand - mediated endocytosis when they were expressed in cells containing wild - type receptors . Coimmunoprecipitation experiments indicated that the C - termi - nal cytoplasmic domain and intermolecular disulﬁde bonds were unnecessary for oligomer formation . We conclude that a - factor receptors form homo - oligomers and that these complexes are subject to ligand - mediated endocytosis . Furthermore , we show for the ﬁrst time that unoc - cupied receptors participate in these endocytosis - competent complexes . INTRODUCTION The G - protein - coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) comprise the larg - est and most diverse superfamily of cell - surface receptors ( Hebert and Bouvier , 1998 ; Bockaert and Pin , 1999 ) . GPCRs mediate responses to a variety of extracellular stimuli such as light , odorants , calcium , hormones , and neurotransmit - ters . They contain a central core of seven putative transmem - brane domains , and signal transduction is mediated by a heterotrimeric G - protein . Until recently , GPCRs have been assumed to function as monomers . Examples of early obser - vations suggesting oligomerization of GPCRs include allelic complementation of coexpressed mutant receptors ( Konopka and Jenness , 1991 ) , and the presence of large SDS - resistant receptor – protein aggregates on SDS - PAGE gels ( Herberg et al . , 1984 ; Blumer et al . , 1988 ; Konopka et al . , 1988 ; Ng et al . , 1993 ) . More direct evidence was obtained recently by using cross - linking and coimmunoprecipitation approaches , suggesting oligomerization of the b 2 - adrener - gic ( Hebert et al . , 1996 ) , d - opioid ( Cvejic and Devi , 1997 ) , D 2 and D 3 dopamine ( Ng et al . , 1996 ; Nimchinsky et al . , 1997 ) , m3 muscarinic ( Zeng and Wess , 1999 ) , metabotropic gluta - mate ( Romano et al . , 1996 ) , and Ca 2 1 - sensing receptors ( Bai et al . , 1998 ) . Although oligomerization is emerging as a common theme for GPCRs , our understanding of this phenomenon is limited . The inﬂuence of agonists on receptor oligomeriza - tion and the structural determinants of the receptor that are important for oligomerization have been shown to vary among the GPCRs investigated . For example , agonists ap - pear to stabilize dimers of b 2 - adrenergic receptors ( Hebert et al . , 1996 ) , whereas agonist binding favors the monomeric state of d - opioid receptors ( Cvejic and Devi , 1997 ) and fails to alter the oligomeric state m3 muscarinic receptors ( Zeng and Wess , 1999 ) . Transmembrane region VI is thought to * Corresponding author : E - mail address : duane . jenness @ umassmed . edu . © 2000 by The American Society for Cell Biology 2873 mediate the association of b 2 - adrenergic receptors because peptides containing this sequence interfere with the recov - ery of receptor dimers and interfere with signaling ( Hebert et al . , 1996 ) . In contrast , 15 amino acids in the C - terminal tail of d - opioid receptor are associated with dimerization ( Cvejic and Devi , 1997 ) , and the Ca 2 1 - sensing receptor and metabo - tropic glutamate receptor 5 oligomerize through disulﬁde bonds ( Romano et al . , 1996 ; Bai et al . , 1998 ) . Functional signiﬁcance of GPCR oligomerization is cur - rently unclear . Functional interactions between oligomer - ized receptors have been inferred from the cooperative bind - ing of subtype - speciﬁc ligands to receptor heterodimers containing d - and k - opioid receptors ( Jordan and Devi , 1999 ) . The relationship between oligomerization and signal transduction is controversial . Although the transmembrane VI peptide from the b 2 - adrenergic receptor interferes with detection of both receptor dimers and receptor - signaling activity ( Hebert et al . , 1996 ) , this region of the D 1 dopamine receptor inhibits receptor function without affecting oli - gomerization ( George et al . , 1998 ) . For the d - opioid receptor , ligand - induced dissociation of receptor oligomers is found to precede ligand - mediated endocytosis ( Cvejic and Devi , 1997 ) . This correlation suggests that the dissociation of oli - gomers may be an essential step in the endocytic pathway . The a - factor pheromone receptor Ste2p is a GPCR that is present on the surface of yeast haploid cells of the a mating type ( a cells ) . It binds the a - factor pheromone secreted by haploid a cells during mating of a cells and a cells . After a - factor binding , the receptor undergoes a conformational change ( Bukusoglu and Jenness , 1996 ) , resulting in the acti - vation of a heterotrimeric G - protein and a protein kinase cascade . These intracellular signals inhibit cell division and promote transcription of mating - speciﬁc genes . a - Factor re - ceptors are subject to ligand - mediated endocytosis and deg - radation in the vacuole ( Jenness and Spatrick , 1986 ; Schandel and Jenness , 1994 ; Hicke , 1997 ; Mulholland et al . , 1999 ) ; endocytosis is associated with phosphorylation and ubiq - uitination of the cytoplasmic C - terminal domain of the re - ceptor ( Hicke and Riezman , 1996 ; Hicke et al . , 1998 ) . Oli - gomerization of a - factor receptors in the plasma membrane was ﬁrst proposed by Jenness and Spatrick ( 1986 ) because receptors were found to be internalized more rapidly than bound a - factor at subsaturating concentrations . We sought to determine whether yeast a - factor receptors form oli - gomers and whether oligomers are subject to ligand - medi - ated endocytosis . MATERIALS AND METHODS Plasmids pJBK008 is a yeast centromeric plasmid that contains the STE2 and URA3 genes ( Konopka et al . , 1988 ) . pYe ( CEN3 ) 30 is a yeast centro - meric plasmid that contains the TRP1 gene ( Fitzgerald - Hayes et al . , 1982 ) . Plasmid pNED1 ( - Cys ) ( provided by Pam Torrance and Jer - emy Thorner , University of California , Berkeley , Berkeley , CA ) is a derivative of plasmid pNED1 ( David et al . , 1997 ) ; it encodes a modiﬁed Ste2p that contains the Flag epitope and the 6His tags at the C terminus , lacks Cys residues 59 and 252 , and is expressed from the TDH3 promoter . pDJ123 ( provided by Kim Schandel , University of Massachusetts , Worcester , MA ) was constructed by cloning the 4 . 3 - kilobase ( kb ) Bam HI fragment that contains the STE2 gene into the Bam HI site of plasmid vector pYe ( CEN3 ) 30 . pDJ323 ( provided by Gul Bukusoglu , University of Massachusetts , Worcester , MA ) contains ste2 - S184R and was created by hydroxylamine mutagene - sis of plasmid pJBK008 ; the STE2 - coding region was conﬁrmed by DNA sequencing . The yeast integrating plasmid pDJ320 contains the URA3 gene , and it directs synthesis of a fusion protein that contains the a - factor receptor and the green ﬂuorescent protein ( GFP ) under the control of the STE2 promoter ( Li et al . , 1999 ) . Integrating plasmid pDJ379 contains the URA3 gene and the STE2 codons 302 – 431 fused to the coding sequence for GFP ( Li et al . , 1999 ) . Cleavage of pDJ379 with Pst I followed by integration at the chromosomal STE2 locus results in production of full - length Ste2p tagged at the C terminus with GFP . Integrating plasmid pDJ466 contains the TRP1 gene and STE2 codons 302 – 431 fused to the coding sequence for the triple inﬂuenza hemagglutinin ( HA ) epitope . Cleavage of pDJ466 with Pst I followed by integration at the chromosomal STE2 locus results in production of full - length Ste2p tagged at the C terminus with the triple HA epitope . pDJ466 was constructed in two steps : ﬁrst , the 0 . 4 - kb NsiI / Sac II fragment from pDJ320 ( containing STE2 codons 302 – 431 ) was subcloned into plas - mid vector pRS304 ( Sikorski and Hieter , 1989 ) that had been cut with Pst I and Sac II ; and second , the resulting plasmid was digested with Sac I and Sac II and ligated with the Sac I / Sac II - digested product of a polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) that contains the triple HA epitope DNA ( from Mike Tyers , Mount Sinai Hospital , Toronto , ONT ) as template and oligonucleotide primers PO - 140 ( CGTGC - CGAGCTCCCATGGTCAAGCAGCGTAATCTGGAACGTCATA ) and PO - 177 ( GGCTCCCCGCGGTCTTTTACCCATACGATGTTCCTGAC - TAT ) . Integrating plasmid pDJ467 contains the URA3 gene and STE2 codons 156 – 326 fused to the GFP - coding sequence . Cleavage of pDJ467 with Cla Ifollowedbyintegrationatthechromosomal STE2 locusresultsin production of Ste2 - T326 tagged at the C terminus with GFP . pDJ467 was constructedbyligatingthe4 . 5 - kb Nsi I / Sac IIfragment ( lacking STE2 ) from pDJ320 with the Pst I / Sac II - digested product of a PCR reaction that con - tained STE2 DNA ( pDJ320 ) as template and oligonucleotide primers PO - 141 ( GCGAAACTGCAGGGCGACAACTTCAAAAGGATAGGTTT ) and PO - 147 ( CCACACCTACGAGTTCAA ) . pDJ469 ( provided by Padhma Radhakrishnan , University of Massachusetts , Worcester , MA ) is a yeast centromere plasmid that contains URA3 and directs synthesis of Ste2 - T326 tagged at the C terminus with GFP . pDJ469 was created by cloning the Cla I - Xba I fragment ( containing STE2 codons 259 – 326 and GFP ) from pDJ467 into Cla I - Spe I sites in plasmid pDB02 ( Dube and Konopka , 1998 ) . Integrating plasmid pDJ470 contains TRP1 and STE2 codons 156 – 326 fused to the triple HA - coding sequence . Cleavage of pDJ470 with Eco 47III followed by integration at the chromosomal STE2 locus results in production of Ste2 - T326 tagged at the C terminus with the triple HA epitope . pDJ470 was created in two steps . In the ﬁrst step , primers PO - 177 and PO - 186 ( GCGAAAGGTACCGGCGACAACT - TCAAAAGGATAGGTTT ) were used to amplify DNA encoding the tri - ple HA epitope , and the PCR product was cloned between the Sac II and Xba I sites of plasmid pDJ467 , replacing the GFP gene . In the second step , a 0 . 6 - kb sequence in this plasmid ( containing STE2 codons 156 – 326 and the triple HA epitope ) was PCR - ampliﬁed with oligonucleotide primers PO - 140 and PO - 141 , and the Pst I / Sac I - digested product was cloned be - tween the Pst I and Sac I sites of pRS304 .

Oligomerization of a GPCR in Yeast Vol . 11 , September 2000 2875 ary reagent . The results were quantiﬁed by using laser - scanning densitometry ( Molecular Dynamics , Sunnyvale , CA ) . Glycerol Gradient Sedimentation Cells ( 2 3 10 9 ) were collected from exponentially growing cultures that had been untreated or treated with 10 2 7 M a - factor for 5 min . Crude membranes were extracted with n - dodecyl b - d - maltoside as described in the previous section . The extract was cleared by cen - trifugation for 15 min at 13 , 000 3 g and mixed with 4 . 5 m g of BSA ( 4 . 3S ) , 5 m g of mouse IgG ( 7S ) , and 10 m g of ATCase ( 11 . 7S ) as internal marker proteins . The mixture was applied to an 8 – 30 % glycerol gradient in IP buffer and centrifuged in an SW50 rotor at 40 , 000 rpm for 14 h at 4°C . Fourteen 350 - m l fractions were collected assayed for the presence of the tagged receptors and the marker proteins by using SDS - PAGE and immunoblotting methods . Fluorescence Microscopy Cultures were grown overnight at 34°C to a density of 2 3 10 6 cells / ml in 2 Trp 1 CAA medium . These conditions provided se - lection of the plasmids bearing the TRP1 gene . Cells were collected and resuspended in the same volume of YM - 1 medium , and then cultured at 30°C to a density of 10 7 cells / ml . Cultures received cycloheximide ( 10 m g / ml ) for 5 min and were then incubated at 30°C for 15 min in the presence or in the absence of a - factor ( 10 2 7 M ) . Endocytosis was terminated by chilling the cells and adding the metabolic poisons , NaN 3 ( 10 mM ) and KF ( 10 mM ) . Cells were collected by centrifugation , washed with ice - cold phosphate - buff - ered saline , and suspended in 1 / 10 volume of phosphate - buffered saline . Epiﬂuorescent images were obtained with a Nikon micro - scope equipped with a cooled charge - coupled device camera . RESULTS Immunoprecipitation of Differentially - tagged Receptors Interactions between a - factor receptors were evaluated by performing coimmunoprecipitation experiments with differ - entially tagged receptors that had been solubilized with nondenaturing detergent n - dodecyl b - d - maltoside . We ex - amined cells that express a - factor receptors tagged with the inﬂuenza HA epitope ( Ste2 - HA ) as well as a - factor receptors tagged with the GFP ( Ste2 - GFP ) . Both epitope tags were fused to the receptor after the C - terminal residue . The genes encoding the two fusion proteins were present in single copy and used the native STE2 promoter . Crude membranes were prepared and extracted with the detergent . Glycerol gradients were performed to evaluate the size and the ho - mogeneity of the complexes containing receptors . Both Ste2 - HA and Ste2 - GFP sedimented as a single peak with sedimentation coefﬁcient of roughly 8S in glycerol density gradients ( Figure 1A ) , although Ste2 - HA sedimented slightly faster than Ste2 - GFP . The relatively small differences in the molecular weights of the two tagged species are not expected to inﬂuence the sedimentation rate . Similar results were obtained when the cultures had been exposed to a - fac - tor ( Figure 1B ) . Both Ste2 - HA and Ste2 - GFP were found to coimmunoprecipitate , when the receptors in the detergent extract were precipitated with anti - HA antibodies and ana - lyzed with immunoblotting methods ( Figure 2A , lane 3 ) . The two tagged species were resolved on the blot because Ste2 - GFP is signiﬁcantly larger than Ste2 - HA ( 80 vs . 55 kDa , respectively ) . No precipitation of Ste2 - GFP was detected in the analysis of the control cells that expressed only Ste2 - HA or only Ste2 - GFP ( Figure 2A , lanes 1 and 2 , respectively ) . Similar results were obtained by using two other detergents , 1 % Triton X - 100 and 0 . 1 % C12E8 , suggesting that the inter - actions detected between the receptors are not speciﬁc to n - dodecyl b - d - maltoside ( our unpublished results ) . Two protein species containing Ste2 were detected that had molecular weights greater than 100 kDa ( Figure 2A , lanes 1 and 3 ) . Such high - molecular - weight forms , desig - nated “SDS - resistant dimers , ” are commonly observed when analyzing Ste2 and other GPCR proteins ( Blumer et al . , 1988 ; Konopka et al . , 1988 ; Hebert et al . , 1996 ) . We found , however , that the proportion of receptors that migrated as SDS - resistant dimers was variable among different prepara - tions . In earlier work , it has been unclear whether this high - molecular - weight species reﬂects the aggregation of Ste2 with itself or with other proteins , and also it has been Figure 1 . Glycerol gradient sedimentation . Membrane proteins from strain DJ1414 - A were solubilized in IP buffer containing n - dodecyl b - d - maltoside and then resolved on an 8 – 30 % glycerol gradient . Cultures had been untreated ( A ) or treated with 10 2 7 M a - factor for 5 min ( B ) . Fractions were assayed for Ste2 - HA ( E ) and Ste2 - GFP ( F ) and for marker proteins , BSA ( 4 . 3S ) , mouse IgG ( 7S ) , and ATCase ( 11 . 7S ) .

Cells that expressed one or two tagged forms of the receptor ( Ste2 - HA and Ste2 - GFP ) were analyzed . Membrane proteins extracted with n - dodecyl b - d - maltoside were subjected to immunoprecipitation and then analyzed by using immunoblotting methods . The antibodies used for precipitation and for immunoblotting are denoted below each panel ( “IP” and “Probe , ” respectively ) . As indicated above each lane , the cells analyzed expressed Ste2 - HA , Ste2 - GFP , or both . ( A ) Anti - HA antibody precipitates Ste2 - HA , Ste2 - GFP , and SDS - resistant dimers .

Strains were DJ1400 - A ( Ste2 - HA only ) , DJ1404 - A ( Ste2 - GFP only ) , DJ1414 - A ( Ste2 - HA / Ste2 - GFP ) , and DJ211 – 5 - 3 ( Ste2 ) . Oligomerization of a GPCR in Yeast Vol . 11 , September 2000 2877 unclear whether it represents receptor dimers present in the membrane or dimers that arise only after SDS extraction . Interestingly , we detected a single high - molecular - weight protein from cells expressing Ste2 - HA alone ( Figure 2A , lane 1 ) , consistent with Ste2 - HA dimers , whereas cells expressing both Ste2 - HA and Ste2 - GFP produced bands consistent with Ste2 - HA / Ste2 - GFP heterodimers in addition to Ste2 - HA ho - modimers ( Figure 2A , lane 3 ) . The absence of Ste2 - GFP homodimers is expected because the sample had been im - munoprecipitated with anti - HA antibodies . These observa - tions indicate that an SDS - resistant dimer contains more than one molecule of Ste2 . As a more deﬁned method of evaluating coimmunopre - cipitation of Ste2 - HA and Ste2 - GFP , we performed recipro - cal immunoprecipitation experiments . Antibodies against one epitope were used to precipitate receptors from the detergent extract , and then antibodies against the second epitope were used to test for the presence of the second tagged species in the immunoprecipitate . In Figure 2B , an - ti - HA antibodies precipitated 11 % of the Ste2 - GFP from the extracts of cell expressing both receptors ( compare lanes 3 and 7 ) , whereas no detectable Ste2 - GFP was precipitated from the control cells’ extracts containing only Ste2 - GFP or only Ste2 - HA ( lanes 1 and 2 , respectively ) . Similar results were obtained when the cultures had been exposed to a - fac - tor for 5 min ( lanes 4 and 8 ) or 15 min ( our unpublished results ) prior to the analysis . Receptors are normally de - pleted from the plasma membrane after 20 min ( Schandel and Jenness , 1994 ) . In the reciprocal experiment ( Figure 2C ) , anti - GFP antibodies precipitated ; 6 % of the Ste2 - HA from the extracts of cell expressing both receptors ( compare lanes 3 and 6 ) , and no Ste2 - HA was precipitated from either control extract ( lanes 1 and 2 ) . Again , prior exposure to a - factor 5 or 15 min ( our unpublished results ) had no dis - cernable effect . In both experiments , the antibody used for immunoprecipitation cleared all the antigen from the super - natant ( our unpublished results ) . Coprecipitation of Ste2 - HA and Ste2 - GFP was not a con - sequence of incomplete membrane solubilization or nonspe - ciﬁc aggregation of membrane proteins . The coprecipitated Ste2 - HA and Ste2 - GFP were apparently part of the 8S com - plex because essentially all of Ste2 - HA and Ste2 - GFP ex - tracted under these conditions sediment as 8S species ( Fig - ure 1A ) . Moreover , when the 8S peak in Figure 1A was pooled and analyzed according to the reciprocal immuno - precipitation method , we found that 5 % of Ste2 - GFP was precipitated with anti - HA antibody and that 5 % of Ste2 - HA was precipitated with anti - GFP ( our unpublished results ) . In addition , the protein complexes containing Ste2 do not ap - pear to result from nonspeciﬁc aggregation of membrane proteins because the more abundant transmembrane pro - tein , plasma membrane ATPase ( Pma1p ) , was not found in immunoprecipitates containing Ste2 - HA ( Figure 2E ) . We considered the possibility that receptor complexes that we observed were formed only after the proteins were ex - tracted from the membrane with detergent . To test this possibility , we mixed cells that only expressed Ste2HA with cells that only express Ste2 - GFP , and then processed the mixture for immunoprecipitation as described above ( Figure 2D ) . We detected Ste2 - GFP coprecipitate with Ste2 - HA only when both receptors were expressed in the same cells ( Fig - ure 2D , lane 3 ) but not from the mixture of the two cultures expressing Ste2 - HA and Ste2 - GFP receptors individually ( Figure 2D , lane 4 ) . We conclude that a - factor receptors are present in the plasma membrane as complexes containing two or more receptor molecules . Although we were unable to detect changes in the complexes induced by a - factor pretreatment , we cannot rule out the possibility that a - factor inﬂuences higher order states of aggregation that were not stable in the solvent conditions used . Ste2 - S184R Is Internalized with Wild - Type Receptors upon a - Factor Exposure Early work with a - factor receptor endocytosis suggested that receptors are internalized as oligomeric units ( Jenness and Spatrick , 1986 ) . When yeast cells are exposed to sub - saturating concentrations of a - factor , the rate at which a - fac - tor receptor sites are lost from the plasma membrane is greater than the rate of a - factor uptake . This observation suggests that unoccupied receptors are internalized together with the occupied receptors . Three explanations ( not mutu - ally exclusive ) account for these phenomena : 1 ) binding of a - factor may be necessary only to initiate the events that lead to the internalization , i . e . , receptor internalization may proceed even after a - factor dissociates ; 2 ) the invaginations of the plasma membrane that occur during endocytosis may be large enough to include both occupied receptors and neighboring unoccupied receptors ; and / or 3 ) the occupied and unoccupied receptors may exist as oligomeric units that remain coupled during endocytosis . To determine whether a - factor binding is required to initiate receptor internaliza - tion , we coexpressed wild - type Ste2 and the a - factor – bind - ing - defective mutant Ste2 - S184R . In the presence of a - factor , these two receptors represent occupied and unoccupied re - ceptors , respectively . If the internalization of the unoccupied receptors requires prior occupancy , then endocytosis of Ste2 - S184R should not be induced by a - factor because it does not bind a - factor . Conversely , if internalization of un - occupied receptors reﬂects cointernalization , then Ste2 - S184R internalization should be stimulated by a - factor . Membrane fractionation was used to evaluate ligand - induced exit of Ste2 - S184R from the plasma membrane in the presence and in the absence of the wild - type receptor . We created strains that coexpress both wild - type Ste2 and mutant Ste2 - S184R receptors . Genes encoding both recep - tors were present in a single copy and contained the native STE2 promoter . In each experiment , the chromo - somal allele directed synthesis of HA - tagged receptors and a plasmid - borne , allele - directed synthesis of un - tagged receptors . Exponentially growing cultures were treated with cycloheximide to block new receptor synthe - sis , incubated further either in the presence or in the absence of a - factor , and then after 15 min , the membranes were resolved on Renograﬁn density gradients . Because essentially all of the receptors were on the cell surface prior to treatment , receptors detected in internal mem - brane fractions represent molecules that have exited the plasma membrane . As shown previously ( Schandel and Jenness , 1994 ) , the cells that expressed only wild - type receptors internalized essentially all their receptors in response to a - factor , as indicated by a shift of the Ste2 protein from the denser plasma membrane fractions to the more buoyant internal membrane fractions ( Figure 3A ) . In contrast , cells expressing only Ste2 - S184R showed no Yesilaltay and Jenness Molecular Biology of the Cell 2878 a - factor – induced internalization ( Figure 3B ) . Upon a - fac - tor exposure , a signiﬁcant fraction of the tagged Ste2 - S184R receptors were internalized in cells containing un - tagged wild - type receptors ( Figure 3D ) . This observation suggests that internalization of unoccupied receptors is not a consequence of prior a - factor occupancy because Ste2 - S184R receptors do not bind a - factor . In the recipro - cal experiment , internalization of tagged wild - type recep - tors was not inﬂuenced by the presence of the mutant Ste2 - S184R receptors ( Figure 3C ) . As a second assay for endocytosis of occupied and unoccupied receptors , we used ﬂuorescence microscopy to monitor wild - type and mutant receptors that had been tagged with GFP . Ste2 - S184R - GFP was coexpressed with untagged wild - type receptors to test whether internaliza - tion of the wild - type receptors would cause the internal - ization of the Ste2 - S184R - GFP receptors . To this end , cul - tures that had been treated with cycloheximide were challenged with a - factor . In the absence of a - factor , the cells containing GFP - tagged mutant and wild - type recep - tors exhibited ﬂuorescence both at the plasma membrane and in the vacuole ( Figure 4 ) . Our previous results ( Li et al . , 1999 ) indicate ﬂuorescence in the vacuole reﬂects the free GFP that remains after the Ste2 - GFP fusion protein has been endocytosed and the Ste2 portion of the protein degraded . In presence of a - factor , the wild - type Ste2 - GFP was completely removed from the plasma membrane and appeared as punctate structures presumably correspond - ing to endocytic vesicles ( Figure 4 , top row ) , whereas cells expressing only the Ste2 - S184R mutant receptors showed very little internalization of cell - surface ﬂuorescence ( Fig - ure 4 , middle row ) . In contrast , in cells expressing both Ste2 - S184R - GFP and untagged Ste2 , the plasma mem - brane ﬂuorescence was signiﬁcantly reduced and a greater proportion of the ﬂuorescence appeared in inter - nal punctate structures ( Figure 4 , bottom row ) . When analyzed quantitatively , 32 % of the cells expressing both Ste2 - S184R - GFP and Ste2 showed three or more ﬂuores - cent foci after a - factor treatment , whereas only 7 % of the cells expressing Ste2 - S184R - GFP alone showed more than three ﬂuorescent foci ( Table 2 ) . These observations are consistent with our results from the Renograﬁn gradients , indicating that Ste2 - S184R receptors are internalized with the wild - type receptors in the presence of a - factor . Two criteria were used to judge whether endocytosis of occupied receptors results in the internalization of a sig - niﬁcant portion of surrounding plasma membrane and membrane proteins . First , essentially all of the abundant plasma membrane protein ATPase Pma1 remained at the plasma membrane when the cells containing wild - type receptors were treated with a - factor ( Figure 3 ) . Second , the bulk endocytosis of plasma membranes marked with the vital stain FM4 - 64 ( Vida and Emr , 1995 ) was not inﬂuenced by a - factor ( our unpublished results ) . A sig - niﬁcant portion of the FM4 - 64 was internalized after only 2 min ; however , the staining pattern was indistinguish - able for the cells that were untreated or treated with a - factor . These results suggest that the endocytosis of unoccupied receptors does not simply reﬂect an increased rate of plasma membrane internalization in response to a - factor , and they are consistent with the hypothesis that unoccupied receptors are endocytosed because they form oligomeric complexes with occupied receptors . Figure 3 . Binding - defective receptors , Ste2 - S184R , undergo ligand - induced endocytosis when expressed with wild - type receptors . Each of the four strains analyzed expressed an HA - tagged receptor ( Ste2 - HA or Ste2 - S184R - HA ) en - coded by a chromosomal allele and an untagged plasmid - encoded receptor ( Ste2 or Ste2 - S184R ) . Log - phase cultures in 2 Ura 1 CAA medium were treated with cycloheximide and then cul - tured for 15 min in the absence ( E ) or presence of a - factor ( F ) .

Oligomerization of a GPCR in Yeast Vol . 11 , September 2000 2879 Wild - Type Ste2 Causes Internalization of Endocytosis - defective Receptors in the Presence of a - Factor The C - terminal cytoplasmic tail of Ste2 contains sequence elements that are essential for both basal and ligand - induced endocytosis ( Rohrer et al . , 1993 ; Schandel and Jenness , 1994 ) . The truncated receptor Ste2 - T326 binds a - factor normally , even though it lacks most of the C - terminal tail ( Konopka et al . , 1988 ) . This domain contains the well - characterized en - docytosis motif DAKSS ( Rohrer et al . , 1993 ) . We wished to determine whether the severe endocytosis defect associated with this mutant receptor could be overcome by forming oligomers with wild - type receptors . Coimmunoprecipita - tion of Ste2 - HA and Ste2 - T326 was observed ( our unpub - lished results ) when detergent extracts were analyzed ac - cording to the methods depicted in Figure 2 . Renograﬁn density gradients and ﬂuorescence microscopy were used to monitor endocytosis of Ste2 - T326 tagged with GFP . Table 3 summarizes a - factor – induced internalization of receptors , as judged by Renograﬁn density gradients . Consistent with previous results ( Schandel and Jenness , 1994 ) , Ste2 - T326 - Figure 4 .

The percentage of cells with one or more ﬂuorescent foci ( n $ 1 ) and the percentage of cells with three or more ﬂuorescent foci ( n $ 3 ) are indicated for the cells that had been cultured in the presence or absence of a - factor . More than 200 cells were examined for each entry . b The forms of Ste2 expressed in each strain are shown . Strains used are DJ1408 - A ( rows 1 and 2 ) , DJ1407 - A ( rows 3 and 4 ) , and DJ1406 - A ( rows 5 and 6 ) . Yesilaltay and Jenness Molecular Biology of the Cell 2880 GFP showed no net internalization when the mutant cells were treated with a - factor in the absence of protein synthe - sis . In Table 3 and in the previous study ( Schandel and Jenness , 1994 ) , a small number of the truncated receptors ( 17 . 6 % ) cofractionated with the internal membranes , and this quantity decreased slightly ( to 13 . 5 % ) in the cells that had been exposed to a - factor . However , under these condi - tions , a - factor resulted in a nearly ﬁvefold increase in the accumulation of Ste2 - T326 - GFP in the internal membrane fraction when Ste2 - T326 - GFP and wild - type Ste2 were coex - pressed . This result is consistent with the endocytosis of oligomeric complexes containing truncated and wild - type receptors . It is currently unclear why some of the truncated receptors accumulate in the internal membrane pool , and why this quantity decreases when truncated and wild - type receptors are coexpressed . As has been proposed for CCR5 receptors ( Benkirane et al . , 1997 ) , it is possible that the trun - cated a - factor receptors are partially retained in the endo - plasmic reticulum and that the defect is overcome by form - ing oligomers with the wild - type receptors . Internalization of Ste2 - T326 - GFP also was monitored by using ﬂuorescence microscopy . In the control cells exposed to a - factor , wild - type Ste2 - GFP was depleted from the plasma membrane ( Figure 5 , top row ) , and all of the cells examined contained ﬂuorescent foci ( Table 4 ) . When ex - pressed alone , the majority of Ste2 - T326 - GFP was at the cell Table 3 .

Oligomerization of a GPCR in Yeast Vol . 11 , September 2000 2881 surface at all times , consistent with the endocytosis defect of this mutant ( Figure 5 , middle row ; Table 4 ) . However , when cells coexpressing both Ste2 - T326 - GFP and untagged wild - type receptors were exposed to a - factor , plasma membrane ﬂuorescence was diminished , accompanied by intracellular accumulation of ﬂuorescent foci ( Figure 5 , bottom row ; Ta - ble 4 ) . These results are in agreement with the Renograﬁn density gradient experiments ( Table 3 ) and suggest that oligomeric complexes containing internalization - defective truncated receptors and wild - type receptors are internalized in an a - factor – dependent manner . C - Terminal Cytoplasmic Tail and Cysteine Residues of Ste2 Are Not Required for Oligomerization Coimmunoprecipitation experiments were used to test whether speciﬁc structural features of the receptor play an essential role in the formation of oligomers . To test whether the C - terminal cytoplasmic tail of the receptor is dispensable for oligomerization , we coexpressed two truncated forms of the receptor that were tagged differentially and performed coimmunoprecipitation tests on the detergent - solubilized receptors as described in Figure 1 . We found coprecipitation of Ste2 – T326 - GFP and Ste2 – T326 - HA when the precipitating antibodies were either anti - GFP or anti - HA ( Figure 6 ) . This result suggests that the C - terminal cytoplasmic tail of the receptor is not required for oligomerization . This efﬁciency of precipitation was unaltered when the cells were cultured for 5 min in a - factor prior to analysis . We also considered whether either of the two cysteine residues in the receptor was essential for oligomer formation . The Ca 2 1 - sensing and metabotropic glutamate receptors are proposed to dimerize through disulﬁde bonds ( Romano et al . , 1996 ; Bai et al . , 1998 ) . Two differentially tagged forms of the receptor were coex - pressed under the direction of the strong TDH3 promoter . Plasmid pNED1 ( - Cys ) encodes a mutant form the receptor ( Ste2 - C59S , C252A - Flag - His6 ) that lacks both cysteines and contains the Flag epitope , and this plasmid was introduced into strain 440 - A that directs synthesis of wild - type recep - tors containing the T7 epitope . We were able to precipitate Ste2 - C59S , C252A - Flag - His6 with the anti - T7 antibodies ( our unpublished results ) , indicating the presence oligomers even though one of the receptors lacked cysteine residues . We conclude that the C - terminal cytoplasmic domain and interchain disulﬁde bonds are unnecessary for the formation of receptor oligomers . DISCUSSION In this study , we present evidence indicating that the a - fac - tor receptors from S . cerevisiae form oligomeric complexes in the plasma membrane . Protein complexes containing the receptor were efﬁciently solubilized with the nondenaturing detergent n - dodecyl b - d - maltoside , and , on glycerol density gradients , they sedimented as a monodisperse species with a sedimentation coefﬁcient of ; 8S . When the complexes containing differentially tagged receptors were solubilized under these conditions and subjected to immunoprecipita - tion , both tagged species were precipitated with antibodies speciﬁc for either of the two tags . The efﬁciency of copre - cipitation was not inﬂuenced by the presence of a - factor in Figure 6 . C - terminal tail of Ste2 is not required for coprecipitation . Cells expressing both Ste2 - T326 - HA and Ste2 – T326 - GFP ( strain DJ1417 - A ) were treated with a - factor and processed for immuno - precipitation as in Figure 2 .

Yesilaltay and Jenness Molecular Biology of the Cell 2882 the culture prior to extraction . Membrane fractionation and ﬂuorescence microscopy indicated that oligomeric receptor complexes were subject to endocytosis and that unoccupied receptors could participate in these complexes . First , tagged mutant receptors that lacked the DAKSS endocytosis signal and were unable to undergo constitutive and ligand - in - duced endocytosis became competent for endocytosis when they were coexpressed with untagged wild - type receptors . Second , unoccupied receptors were able to enter these en - docytosis - competent complexes because tagged mutant re - ceptors that were unable to bind a - factor also showed li - gand - dependent endocytosis when they were coexpressed with untagged wild - type receptors . A recently published independent study also reports evidence for oligomerization of a - factor receptors ( Overton and Blumer , 2000 ) . These authors used ﬂuorescence resonance energy transfer be - tween differentially tagged receptors in whole cells as an indicator for oligomerization . They also showed that tagged receptors lacking the DAKSS endocytosis signal were endo - cytosed when coexpressed with wild - type receptors ; how - ever , they did not explore the endocytosis of unoccupied receptors , and they did not identify complexes in a mem - brane - free detergent - soluble system . Little is known about the size and the structure of the oligomeric complexes that contain GPCRs . Although deter - gent - solubilized a - factor receptors ( 48 kDa ) sedimented faster than the IgG marker protein ( 160 kDa ) , we do not know the extent to which detergent , shape , hydration , and other proteins contribute to the sedimentation rate . Two observations indicate that at least a portion of the a - factor – receptor complexes contain more than one receptor mole - cule . First , the HA - tagged receptors sediment slightly faster than the GFP - tagged receptors even though the GFP - tagged receptors are larger . One interpretation is that oligomers containing Ste2 - HA are more stable than those containing Ste2 - GFP ; however , we have no direct corroborating evi - dence for a difference in afﬁnity . Second , 6 – 11 % coprecipi - tation of the differentially tagged receptors indicates that a minimum of 12 – 22 % of these complexes are in oligomers ( assuming two receptors per complex ) . This value is likely to be an underestimate because some complexes may disag - gregate during analysis and because tighter associating forms ( i . e . , Ste2 - HA ) may tend to reassociate into relatively stable homo - oligomers leaving the weaker interacting spe - cies ( i . e . , Ste2 - GFP ) to form less stable oligomers . Based on the extensive cointernalization of mutant and wild - type re - ceptors , it is likely that most of the receptors are in the oligomeric form in vivo . The structural determinants that bind a - factor receptors together are also unclear . Although metabotropic glutamate and Ca 2 1 - sensing receptors require the disulﬁde bonds of cysteines for oligomerization and d - opioid receptors oligomerize through sequences in the C - terminal domain , we ﬁnd that neither of these structural features play an essential role in the oligomerization of a - factor receptors . Although transmembrane segment VI of b 2 - adrenergic receptors and D 1 dopamine receptors are thought to play an essential role in aggregation , this possi - bility has not yet been explored for the a - factor receptor . Our data do not exclude the possibility that a bridging protein mediates the association of receptor molecules . Functional consequences of GPCR oligomerization are not well understood . The ability of one receptor to inﬂuence the activity of another receptor in the same oligomeric complex has been inferred from the cooperative binding of type - speciﬁc agonists to cells that coexpress d - and k - opioid re - ceptors . Although the hypersensitivity phenotype of trun - cated a - factor receptors is reversed when they are coexpressed with wild - type receptors ( Konopka et al . , 1988 ; Reneke et al . , 1988 ) , this phenomenon is most readily ex - plained by competition of the mutant and wild - type recep - tors for a common pool of G - proteins ( Dosil et al . , 2000 ) rather than by direct aggregation of the two receptor forms . The functional consequences of disrupting GPCR oligomer - ization in vivo have been investigated by exposing cells to peptides corresponding to single transmembrane segments of the receptor . A peptide that comprises transmembrane VI of b 2 - adrenergic receptors inhibits both oligomerization and signal transduction activities of these receptors , suggesting that oligomerization may be essential for signaling ( Hebert et al . , 1996 ) . However , the signiﬁcance of this argument has recently been called into question because , for D 1 dopamine receptors , a peptide containing transmembrane segment VI inhibits signaling without inhibiting oligomerization ( George et al . , 1998 ) . It is possible that variations in the amount of oligomerized GPCRs mediate the response to agonists because the oligomeric state of some GPCRs is either increased or decreased by ligand binding ( Hebert et al . , 1996 ; Cvejic and Devi , 1997 ) . For the d - opioid receptor , the dimer - to - monomer transition has been associated with endocytosis because the natural agonists induce monomers prior to endocytosis and because morphine does not induce receptor internalization and does not alter the oligomeric state ( Cvejic and Devi , 1997 ) . Disaggregation of a - factor receptors does not appear to control ligand - mediated endo - cytosis because the aggregation state is unaffected by the a - factor and because endocytosis - defective mutant receptors are internalized when they are associated with wild - type receptors . a - Factor receptors provide a genetically tractable model to study the role that oligomerization plays in the GPCR function .
