WETIERER Wilkes Honors College , Florida Atlantic University , Jupiter ( USA ) Many authors have written about how exotic ants invaded the Atlantic islands of Madeira and negatively impacted or even completely exterminated its native ants , despite the lack of firsthand observations concerning such impact . I examine how quotation error ( misrepresentation of previous work ) and citation copying ( citing unexamined publications referred to by others ) led to the origin and spread of the erroneous story of ant extinctions in Madeira . Quotation error and citation copying may be more common than most scientists realize , particularly when authors cite references that are written in languages they do not understand . Introduction The big - headed ant ( Pheidole megacephala ) and Argentine ant ( Linepithema humile , formerly Iridomyrmex humilis ) are invasive species well known for negative impacts on native invertebrates . As a dramatic illustration of these impacts , many authors cite the case of Madeira . According to HASKINS & HASKINS ( 1965 ) : " Heer ' s careful studies ( 1852 , 1856 ) leave no doubt that by the middle of the nineteenth century Pheidole megacephala had supplanted the entire native ant fauna of Madeira . By 1898 it had itself been as completely supplanted by I . humilis . " This often repeated story , if true , would be remarkable . Ecological domination of this scale by a single ant species is not known in any other place in the world . Fortunately , it is not true . I found no published studies documenting any impact of P . megacephala or L . humile on native ants of Madeira . In recent surveys , WETIERER et al . ( in press ) found nine of the ten native ant species ever collected in Madeira were still present ; all except a single endemic species , Temnothorax wollastoni , described in 1940 that was collected only once . WETIERER et al . ( in press ) found that native ants dominated almost all of Madeira ; P . megacephala and L . humile were restricted to - 0 . 3 % and - 6 % of Madeira ' s land area , respectively , and probably never occupied more than 10 % of the island . Any impact of P . megacephala and L . humile on the native ants of Madeira appears to have been quite limited . So how did HASKINS & HASKINS ( 1965 ) and others get the story wrong ?

K . WElTERER : Ant extinctions in Madeira Here , I examine firsthand and secondhand accounts of P . megacephala and L . humile in Madeira , retracing how the story of two successive mass exterminations originated and spread . My presentation focuses on problems of quotation error ( misrepresenting research and conclusions of others ) and citation copying ( citing without examination a publication found in the reference list of a secondhand source ) . Methods I compiled publications that presented secondhand information concerning the spread and / or impact of P . megacephala and L . humile in Madeira , but lacked any firsthand information on the topic . I excluded many papers that had firsthand observations on ants from Madeira ( see below ) and local publications from Madeira ( e . g . , SARMENTO , 1937 ; DA SILVA & DE MENEZES , 1940 ) . For books with mUltiple editions , I consulted only one edition , in English if available . I did not include publications that simply noted the presence of P . megacephala or L . humile in Madeira ( e . g . , PASSER A , 1994 ) , or only referred to P . megacephala by its once popular common name , the " Madeira house ant " ( e . g . , BLACKBURN & KIRBY , 1880 ) . For each secondhand source , I noted the information presented concerning the spread and impact of P . megacephala and L . humile in Madeira , what source they cited for this information , whether the information included errors , and whether these errors were also in the cited publication . If the errors were not in the cited publication , I evaluated the probable source of the errors , based on the nature of the errors and what other sources were cited elsewhere in the publication . As a rough guide to how often each publication has been used in recent research , and thus may have acted as a recent information source , I counted the number of times each has been cited in recognizable form as compiled by the Institute for Scientific Information ( lSI ) Web of Knowledge as of May 2005 . Results I found 55 sources of exclusively secondhand information on the spread and / or impact of P . megacephala and / or L . humile in Madeira ( Tables 1 - 3 ) . There have been many publications with substantial firsthand information concerning ants from Madeira ( e . g . , SMITH , 1858 ; MA YR , 1865 ; 1876 ; EMERY , 1882 ; 1893 ; FOREL , 1904 ; 1928 ; SCHMITZ , 1897 ; SAUNDERS , 1903 ; STITZ , 1940 ; WELLEN IUS , 1949 ) . The information that formed the basis of the Madeira ant extinction story , however , traced back to just two papers , HEER ( 1852 ) and STOLL ( 1898 ) , though STOLL ' S ( 1898 ) information was not tirsthand , but instead based on personal communications from Forel about his work with Schmitz ( FOREL , 1895 ; SCHMITZ , 1896 ) . 352 Scientometrics 67 ( 2006 ) J . K . WETIERER : Ant extinctions in Madeira Here I present a reconstruction of the main events in the origin and spread of the ant extinction story , starting with the original firsthand observations . Although the popularization of the story can be traced primarily to the work of Wheeler and Haskins and their citing of HEER ( 1852 ) and STOLL ( 1898 ) , my analyses suggest that the erroneous extinction story actually originated in three papers that have never been cited as sources for this information . The often - cited firsthand account of P . megacephala Oswald Heer , 1809 - 83 , a Swiss botanist and paleontologist , spent several months in Funchal , Madeira ' s capital , from winter 1850 to spring 1851 , recovering from tuberculosis ( DA SILVA & DE MENEZES , 1940 ) . Heer ' s paper " On the house ant of Madeira " ( 1852 in German ; 1856 in English ) concerned an ant that he described as a new species , Oecophthora pusilla , but which was later recognized as P . megacephala . HEER ( 1852 ; 1856 ) primarily reported on the morphology and behavior of P . megacephala . Concerning its distribution in Madeira , he wrote only that : " they are found on the whole south side of the island of Madeira , up to a height of about 1000 feet above the sea , in incalculable numbers , especially in hot sunny places . In turning over ten stones in such places , these ants are pretty sure to be living under eight . In the city of Funchal there can scarcely be a house which does not harbour millions of these creatures , which mount up to the highest stones , issue forth in whole troops out of chinks of the walls and floor , and in orderly regular columns traverse the room in all directions . They creep up the table legs , along their edges , upon the tables themselves , and even into chests of drawers , boxes , etc . " ( HEER , 1856 ) . It is worth noting that the island of Madeira is very mountainous , with 90 % of its land area above 500 m elevation ( SZIEMER , 1999 ) . Thus , the land below 1000 feet ( 308 m ) of the south side on Madeira reportedly occupied by P . megacephala represents less than 5 % of the island ' s land area . Concerning impact , HEER ( 1856 ) mentioned that P . megacephala consumed food around his house and destroyed his dried insect collection . He also observed P . megacephala workers attacking houseflies and captive termites and grasshoppers inside his house , and attacking cochineal insects in his garden . The only impact HEER ( 1856 ) mentioned outside his home was that " snails , worms , caterpillars , and the like , in general are never found under the same stone ; seldom even a millepede [ sic ] ( Juius ) , which they attack only when the nest is disturbed . " HEER ( 1856 ) made no mention of any impact of P . megacephala on other ants in Madeira . Scientometrics 67 ( 2006 ) 353 J . K . WElTERER : Ant extinctions in Madeira The seldom - cited firsthand accounts of L . humile Auguste - Henri Forel , 1848 - 1931 , a Swiss neuro - anatomist and myrmecologist , reported on ant specimens he received from Madeira . FOREL ( 1895 , in German ) wrote : " to my surprise Mr . Schmitz twice sent me from Madeira the typical Iridomyrmex humilis Mayr from the Neotropical fauna , which is already a house and land pest in Madeira . . . Mr . Schmitz believed he had Heer ' s Madeiran house ant , however the latter type is Pheidole megacephala Fabr . . . In Heer ' s time Iridomyrmex humilis was not obvious in Madeira and since that time this type has displaced Pheidole from house and garden . . . Heer ' s Madeiran house ant ( Oecophthora pusilla ) was found however at wild places of the island and no longer in houses . " FOREL ( 1921 in French ; 1928 in English ) further recounted events in Madeira : " In 1852 , during a long stay in Madeira , Oswald Heer ( Die Hausameise Madeiras ) very carefully described the habits of Pheidole megacephala , which he named Oecophthora pusilla , the ant of the Madeira houses . In 1895 , Father Schmitz , who thought he had come in contact with Heer ' s ant , sent me as such a South American ant Iridomyrmex humilis Mayr . I wrote to him pointing out his error and requesting him to make a thorough investigation of the surrounding rocks ; and there he discovered Pheidole megacephala , which had fled thither for refuge , at the same time confirming my belief that no house ants were left in Madeira except Iridomyrmex humilis " ( FOREL , 1928 : 167 - 168 ) . Ernst Schmitz , 1845 - 1922 , a German priest and ornithologist , moved to Madeira in 1878 and became head of the Funchal Seminary ( DA SILVA & DE MENEZES , 1940 ) . SCHMITZ ( 1896 in Portuguese ) described how Funchal and its outskirts were overrun with L . humile . SCHMITZ ( 1896 ) could not find P . megacephala in Funchal or its suburbs , writing " only at a distance of one league from Funchal , near the S . Gon ~ alo crossroad , in sandy and rocky land , can it be encountered . " SCHMITZ ( 1896 ) noted that L . humile was common on Madeira ' s south coast , but it was stilJ uncommon on the east and north coasts . Although SCHMITZ ( J 896 ) reported that L . humile had replaced P . megacephala as the house ant of Funchal , he did not report any impact on other ant species . In total , SCHMITZ ( 1896 ; 1897 ) reported 12 ant taxa from the Madeira archipelago . STOLL ' S ( 1898 ) often - cited secondhand account Otto Stoll based his paper " The Geographical Spreading of Ants " ( 1898 in German ) on information " partly by oral communications from my friend Prof . Forel , partly by handwritten notes which he sent to me . " STOLL ( 1898 ) devoted just two sentences to the ants of Madeira , writing only : " When Heer visited Madeira he found there as ' house ant ' Pheidole megacephala Heer . Since then however a different type Iridomyrmex 354 Scientometrics 67 ( 2006 ) J . K . WETIERER : Ant extinctions in Madeira humilis Mayr has been transported to Madeira , which at present plays the role of ' house ant ' to such an extent that the original ' house ant ' has been driven out of houses by the invader and now occurs only in the countryside . " These two sentences succinctly and accurately summarized the main conclusions of Heer , Schmitz , and Forel regarding P . megacephala and L . humile in Madeira , and included mention of no other species , ant or otherwise . Remarkably , this paper became the most commonly cited source concerning the spread and impact of P . megacephala and L . humile in Madeira . Wheeler ' s original popularization William Morton Wheeler , 1865 - 1937 , a prominent American myrmecologist , wrote accounts concerning ants in Madeira in at least seven publications . The earliest three accurately presented the conclusions of Heer , Schmitz , Forel , and Stoll . In a paper on exotic ants in the USA , WHEELER ( 1906a ) wrote : " according to Stoll ( 1898 ) [ L . humile ] has also been imported into Madeira where it has become a pest in houses and has supplanted another previously introduced species ( Pheidole megacephala Fabr . ) which was the house - ant of the island in the days of Heer ( 1852 ) . " WHEELER ( 1906a ) followed this with his own translation of the extended quote from HEER ( 1852 ) concerning the distribution of P . megacephala in Madeira , which I quoted from HEER ( 1856 ) above . In a paper on the ants of Bermuda , WHEELER ( 1906b ) wrote , without mention of houses : " In Madeira , for example , according to Stoll ( 1898 ) , Pheidole megacephala , which was extremely abundant in the first half of the nineteenth century , as we learn from the careful work of Heer ( 1852 ) , has been displaced by another tramp species , Iridomynnex humilis . " In a book on ants , WHEELER ( 1910 : 154 ) repeated almost verbatim what he wrote about P . megacephala and L . humile in WHEELER ( 1906a ) . WHEELER ( 1910 ) followed this with an account of P . megacephala on the tiny Caribbean island of Culebrita that was much like later erroneous accounts of this species in Madeira " I was astonished to find [ Culebrita ] completely overrun with Ph . megacephala . This ant was nesting under every stone and log , from the shifting sand of the sea - beach to the walls of the light - house on the highest point of the island . The most careful search failed to reveal the presence of any other species . . . It is highly probable that Ph . megacephala . . . had exterminated all the other ants which must have previously inhabited Culebrita " ( WHEELER 1910 : 155 ) . Earliest quotation error : the story begins The earliest secondhand accounts that I found with quotation errors were by MARTINS ( 1907 ) , WOODWORTH ( 1910 ) and NEWELL & BARBER ( 1913 ) . In a paper on L . humile invading Europe , MARTINS ( 1907 in French ) wrote : " About 25 years ago , a Scientometrics 67 ( 2006 ) 355 J . K . WElTERER : Ant extinctions in Madeira terrible blight distressed the inhabitants of Madeira . A very small insect , Iridomyrmex humi / is , an almost microscopic ant , probably from Brazil or British Guyana , invaded the island , and through its ravages grieved the Madeirans , who were powerless to defend themselves against the attacks of this fearsome enemy , and found no remedy to oppose its quick spread . . . In Madeira , one was unable to rent some houses at great expense because of the bad habits of this insect , which are unforgiving . Before this pest disappear other larger ants , and many other types of wildlife . " MARTINS ( 1907 ) cited no source for information on Madeira , and mentioned only one source in the entire paper : Fore \ . This paper is the oldest paper mentioning an impact of L . humile on ants and other species in Madeira . In a monograph on the control of L . humile in the USA , WOODWORTH ( 1910 ) wrote : " the previous record , besides the native countries Brazil and the Argentine Republic , were the Madera [ sic ] Islands , with an area of over 500 square miles completely infested as early as 1898 , " citing no source reference . WOODWORTH ' s ( 1910 ) baseless statement on the spread of L . humile is particularly remarkable given that the entire Madeira archipelago has a total area of only 307 square miles ( 796 km 2 ) . Although WOODWORTH ( 1910 ) cited no source of information , the date 1898 no doubt referred to STOLL ( 1898 ) , probably obtained from WHEELER ( 1906a or 1906b ) . In two papers on L . humile , NEWELL ( \ 908 ) and NEWELL & BARBER ( 1913 ) accurately wrote that WHEELER ( 1906a ) " gives an interesting account of how this species obtained a foothold in Madeira and supplanted another introduced species , Pheidole megacephala Fabr . " NEWELL & BARBER ( 1913 ) , however , went further , writing : " according to Stoll [ 1898 ] and Wheeler [ 1910 ] the Argentine ant , after its accidental introduction into the island of Madeira , entirely exterminated another species , Pheidole megacephala Fabr . , which was itself an introduced species that had exterminated the native ants before it . " This is the earliest paper to present the full blown ant extinction story . NEWELL & BARBER ( \ 913 ) clearly did not read STOLL ( \ 898 ) and they misinterpreted WHEELER ( \ 910 ) . Perhaps NEWELL & BARBER ( 1913 ) mistakenly believed that events that WHEELER ( \ 910 ) observed on Culebrita also occurred in Madeira . NEWELL & BARBER ( \ 913 ) cited MARTINS ( \ 907 ) and WOODWORTH ( 1910 ) for other information , and were probably influenced by their accounts of L . humile in Madeira . No later paper has cited MARTINS ( \ 907 ) , WOODWARD ( \ 910 ) , or NEWELL & BARBER ( 1913 ) as a source of information on ants in Madeira . NEWELL & BARBER ( 1913 ) , however , has continued to serve as an important source of information on L . humile ( e . g . , with 100 citations listed by lSI ) , exposing several generations of scientists to the Madeira ant extinction story . 356 Scientometrics 67 ( 2006 ) J . K . WElTERER : Ant extinctions in Madeira Wheeler ' s evolving story In a monograph on African ants , WHEELER ( 1922 : 128 ) wrote that P . megacephala : " has been carried to all parts of the tropics and has become a great pest in and about dwellings and plantations as it assiduously cultivates coccids on many economic plants and ruthlessly destroys and replaces the native ant - faunas . This has been observed in the Madeira Islands , Hawaii , Australia , and the West Indies . " WHEELER ( 1922 : 342 - 343 ) further wrote that P . megacephala " is the famous house ant of Madeira ( 0 . Heer , 1852 and 1856 ) , which has now established itself everywhere in the tropics and sUbtropics . Pheidole megacephala has of late been replaced as house ant in Madeira by the Argentine ant , lridomyrmex humilis . " Thus , WHEELER ( 1922 ) implicated P . megacephala in destroying the native ants of Madeira . I believe WHEELER ' S ( 1922 ) erroneous presentation was probably influenced by the erroneous accounts of MARTINS ( 1907 ) , WOODWARD ( 1910 ) , and NEWELL & BARBER ( 1913 ) , all three of which he cited in his summary of information on L . humile ( WHEELER 1922 : 921 ) . In a book on social insects , WHEELER ( 1926 in French , 1928 in English ) apparently completely forgot what HEER ( 1852 ) and STOLL ( 1898 ) actually wrote , and shifted essentially to NEWELL & BARBER ' s ( 1913 ) scenario , writing : " Heer showed that by 1852 this ant had taken complete possession of the island of Madeira , " . . . but . . . " according to Stoll ( 1898 ) , [ L . humile ] landed also in Madeira and succeeded in supplanting Pheidole megacephala , which had held possession of the island since the days of Heer " ( WHEELER 1928 : 319 - 320 ) . In a paper on the ants of the Canary Islands , WHEELER ( 1927 ) returned to a faithful retelling of firsthand observations , writing : " In 1893 when Father Ernest Schmitz tirst sent specimens to Professor Forel from Madeira , the latter expressed himself as surprised to receive the insect from such a locality . During the same year Father Schmitz published a Portuguese article in which he stated that the insect had just become a ' veritable plague and public calamity ' in Funchal . " WHEELER ( 1927 ) went on to quote extensively from SCHMITZ ' ( 1896 ) work . WHEELER ( 1927 ) also wrote , concerning P . megacephala being driven out of Funchal , that " a similar observation is also cited by Stoll ( 1898 ) . " WHEELER ( 1927 ) was clearly unaware that Stoll ' s information was simply a repetition of Schmitz ' observations by way of personal communications from Forel . WHEELER ( 1927 ) listed fifteen ant taxa from the Madeira archipelago , though he did not cite the source of this information . Finally , in a paper on Hawaiian ants , WHEELER ( 1934 ) wrote " Among the intercepted species we find also the Argentine ant , lridomyrmex humilis , an originally neotropical species and the most pernicious of those recorded . Should it eventually secure a foothold in the islands , we may look forward to a repetition of what has occurred in Madeira and the Canary Islands , where it has not only exterminated Pheidole megacephala , but has also practically wiped out the indigenous ant fauna at Scientometrics 67 ( 2006 ) 357 J . K . WETIERER : Ant extinctions in Madeira elevations below 3 , 000 feet , " citing no source for this misinformation . It is unclear how WHEELER ( 1927 ) could have extensively quoted SCHMITZ ( 1896 ) and listed many of ant species known from Madeira , and then a few years later write this clearly contradictory account . It is also striking that WHEELER ( 1922 ) implicated P . megacephala in exterminating the native ants of Madeira , but WHEELER ( 1934 ) now blamed L . humile . Haskins ' elaboration of the story : the legend grows Caryl P . Haskins , 1908 - 2001 , an American inventor who also published numerous papers on ants and fish , expanded the story of Madeira ants to mythic proportions , particularly in his popular book , Of Ants and Men ( HASKINS 1939 in USA , 1945 in England ) , which was translated into 13 other languages ( ABELSON , 2003 ) . HASKINS ( 1939 ) wrote that P . megacephala : 358 " was introduced into many islands of the Atlantic and Pacific , and proceeded in its conquest in a very definite way . We have a particularly good picture of the way in which this happened in Madeira , thanks to the observations of Heer . Pheidole megacephala apparently came into Madeira early in the nineteenth century . At first it confined its nesting sites and its foraging activities almost wholly to the houses and gardens of the settlers , where food was abundant and the composition of foreign species small . New types of bulbs and other plants appeared in the settlers ' gardens , and before long they became infested with aphids and such sweet excreting insects . Pheidole promptly took charge of these insects , encouraged their increase , and fed largely upon the manna which they produced . Gradually , as pressure within its own species increased , and as the native ants weakened with the advent of man , Pheidole pushed back into unsettled territory . It first established itself in the bleaker , less hospitable regions of the Island , in which it alone was titted to survive . With these regions as a base , it shortly raided more attractive ground , and began a steady , deadly push against the less hardy , less adaptable , and less organized types . Mass raids are the rule with Pheidole , and hosts of the tiny creatures evidently invaded nest after nest of larger but more loosely organized species , killing the queens , and forcing the workers to evacuate . Their own losses in workers were territic , but the great fecundity of their queens maintained the pressure of numbers , and the race pushed onward . When Heer visited Madeira in 1852 , no species of ant save Pheidole could be found . It occupied every crack and cranny from the shore line to the highest crest of the Island , and had become a serious house pest . Outdoors it fed on dead insects , occasionally on seeds , and cultivated aphids and other forms of nectar - producing insects . Indoors it abandoned every form of raiding and cultivation and subsisted quite simply on human food stuffs " ( HASKINS , 1939 : 156 - 157 ) . Scientometrics 67 ( 2006 ) 1 . K . WEITERER : Ant extinctions in Madeira A few pages later , HASKINS ( 1939 ) continued his story with the Argentine ant ' s subsequent arrival and conquest : " Madeira is a crossroads for the traffic of the South Atlantic , and as such it could hardly better be missed by Iridomyrmex , coming from the western New World , than by Pheidole in its march from the East . Accordingly , the former arrived some time between 1852 and 1898 , and immediately came into conflict with Pheidole , which had by 1852 exterminated all of the native ants of its environment , as we have seen . Nowhere could a better theatre of action have been found for the observation of this conflict of two world - conquering races . Proceeding by methods almost identical with those employed by Pheidole on the same soil a half - century or less earlier , but undoubtedly with superior strategy born of its more complex organization , Iridomyrmex completely displaced the earlier invader , and today Madeira is overrun with the foraging columns of the tiny brown " Argentine ant " pest , while the Pheidole colonies of yore are not to be found . The conquest is complete , and the relative merits of this Myrmicine and this Dolchoderine [ sic ] ant as world - conquerors have been determined for all time " ( HASKINS , 1939 : 161 ) . Most of HASKINS ' ( 1939 ) vivid descriptions of the events in Madeira did not come from any firsthand source . HASKINS ' ( 1939 ) use of the dates 1852 and 1898 no doubt referred to HEER ( 1852 ) and STOLL ( 1898 ) , though the inaccurate details suggest that Haskins did not read either paper . Haskins ' reference to settlers in the early 1800 ' s is strikingly incongruent with the settlement of Madeira by the Portuguese in the early 1400 ' s . Elsewhere in his book , HASKINS ( 1939 ) states that " a drive goes on today in the Bermuda Islands between two rival communities of these sorts , and a similar fierce battle was fought a decade ago for the possession of Madeira " ( HASKINS , 1939 : 140 ) . To match the dates of a battle that he wrote had finished by 1898 , Haskins must have written this statement before 1908 , except that 1908 is the year Haskins was born . In a paper on ants in Bermuda , HASKINS & HASKINS ( 1965 ) repeated the erroneous ant extinction story : " Heer ' s careful studies ( 1852 , 1856 ) leave no doubt that by the middle of the nineteenth century Pheidole megacephala had supplanted the entire native ant fauna of Madeira . By 1898 it had itself been as completely supplanted by I . humilis . Thus the complete replacement required , at a maximum , 44 years . But it could have been very much swifter . We have no record of when I . humilis was introduced to Madeira . In fact , we know nothing in detail of the replacement pattern , either as to space or to time . " In reference to P . megacephala in Madeira , HASKINS & HASKINS ( 1965 ) wrote " we have few detailed accounts of its pattern of occupation beyond those of Heer ( 1852 , 1856 ) and of Stoll ( 1898 ) . " HASKINS & HASKINS ( 1988 ) further propagated the story ( see Appendix I ) . Scientometrics 67 ( 2006 ) 359 J . K . WEITERER : Ant extinctions in Madeira Passing on the ant extinction story HASKINS ' ( 1939 ) vivid account helped entrench the Madeira ant extinction story in the scientific literature . For example , in a book on social insects , RICHARDS ( 1953 in England , 1961 in USA ) wrote " as Haskins has shown " L . humile has " established itself in many of the warmer parts of the world and in some , such as the island of Madeira , it has completely eliminated the local ant fauna " ( RICHARDS , 1961 : 208 ) . Interestingly , RICHARDS ( 1961 ) cited Haskins as implicating L . humile in killing off the native ants of Madeira , this contradicts Haskins , who consistently blamed P . megacephala . In a paper on Myrmica ants , BRIAN ( 1956 ) wrote : " Haskins ( 1945 ) has given a graphic account of the changes in ant distribution that have followed in the wake of man . The island of Madeira has been the scene of two such changes in the past century : early in the nineteen century Pheidole megacephala Forel began a replacement which was certainly complete by the middle of the century ( Heer 1852 , 1856 ) ; it has since been replaced by Iridomyrmex humilis Emery which is still expanding its range . " SIMBERLOFF ( 1978 , 1981 ) introduced the Madeira ant extinction story to an audience beyond those studying social insects . In a paper on island biogeography , SIMBERLOFF ( 1978 ) wrote that Pheidole megacephala had replaced " virtually the entire native ant fauna on Madeira . Somewhat later , I . humilis spread in similar fashion from western South America , completely replacing P . megacephala on Madeira by 1898 . " In a paper on the community effects of introduced species , SIMBERLOFF ( 1981 ) wrote : " Extinction , apparently competitive , is known in ants . Pheidole megacephala replaced native ants on Bermuda and Madeira , but was subsequently extinguished itself by Iridomyrmex humilis , the ' Argentine ant ' , on Madeira , and appears to be fading fast on Bermuda ( Haskins & Haskins , 1965 ; Crowell 1968 ) . In spite of extensive field observation , no direct evidence exists on the nature of the competition . " Quantitative analyses In addition to the 18 secondhand accounts presented above ( see Table 1 ) , I found 37 other secondary sources , including 26 with errors ( Table 2 , Appendix 1 ) and 11 without ( Table 3 , Appendix 2 ) . Of the 55 publications , 17 did not cite any source for their information ( Tables 1 - 3 ) . Among the 38 publications that did credit one or more sources , Stoll was cited in 17 publications , Heer in 14 , Wheeler in eight , Haskins in seven , Schmitz in two , Forel in one , a letter from " the Madeira Entomologist " in one , and Fluker & Beardsley who cited Wheeler in one ( Tables 1 - 3 ) . Besides two papers that I wrote , only 13 publications cited a firsthand source concerning P . megacephala in Madeira , and only three cited a firsthand source concerning L . humile in Madeira . FELLERS & FELLERS ( 1981 ) cited a firsthand source , but for the wrong species , crediting " Heer ( 1892 , in Wheeler 1910 ) " for misinformation on L . humile , though HEER ( 1852 ) only wrote about P . megacephaZa . 360 Scientometrics 67 ( 2006 ) J . K . WETfERER : Ant extinctions in Madeira In all , 38 of the 55 secondhand sources included errors with regard to the spread and / or impact of P . megacephala and / or L . humile in Madeira , i . e . , inconsistent with the firsthand accounts of Heer , Schmitz , and Forel ( Tables 1 - 2 ) . Among the 38 secondhand sources that included errors , ten cited no source , 19 attributed the Madeira information exclusively to papers without errors , and nine credited at least one earlier secondhand sources with errors . I only found evidence that Wheeler and Illingworth actually read HEER ( 1852 ) . All other authors who cited HEER ( 1952 ) attributed misinformation to this paper , and I expect they did not read it . It appears that among the citing authors , only Wheeler may have read STOLL ( 1898 ) , and in his later writing Wheeler apparently forgot what Stoll had written . I believe that many authors who cited STOLL ( 1898 ) and WHEELER ( 1906a ; 1910 ) for errors not found in these publications , probably did so because NEWELL & BARBER ( 1913 ) cited them . Further evidence supporting the contention that citing authors did not read HEER ( 1852 ) or STOLL ( 1898 ) comes from the fact that HEER ( 1852 ) and STOLL ( 1898 ) wrote primarily of P . megacepha / a and L . humile in the houses of Madeira , but few later retellings ( besides those of Wheeler and Illingworth ) mentioned houses ( Tables 1 - 3 ) . Those that do ( HASKINS , 1939 ; MORLEY , 1939 ; 1953 ; YARROW , 1967 ) probably obtained this information from a source other than Heer or Stoll ( namely Forel or Wheeler ) . Table I .

K . WETfERER : Ant extinctions in Madeira Discussion Misinformation on the spread and impact of Pheidole megacephala and Linepithema humile in Madeira is now well entrenched in the scientific literature . I expect that all current researchers studying P . megacephala or L . humile have read several sources alleging impacts of these ants in Madeira . Most recent secondhand sources of information on the spread and impact of P . megacephala and L . humile in Madeira include in their bibliographies several earlier papers with errors ( Tables 1 - 3 ) . It is ironic that the papers that apparently originated the ant extinction story ( MARTINS , 1907 ; WOODWORTH , 1910 ; NEWELL & BARBER , 1913 ) have never been cited as sources of information concerning Madeira , while the most often credited source ( STOLL , 1898 ) is error - free , yet is the cited source for a wide range of errors . I believe that all authors citing STOLL ( 1898 ) , including Wheeler , assumed incorrectly that this reference was a firsthand source , despite Stoll ' s clear statement that he got his information from Fore ! ' The fact that STOLL ( 1898 ) wrote in German no doubt helps explain why non - German - speaking authors did not know the contents of this paper . I spoke with two researchers who recently cited STOLL ( 1898 ) as the source of misinformation not actually found in that paper and both told me that they actually took the misinformation from Haskins ' work . Although science is typically viewed as being " self - correcting , " I found no paper that has questioned the validity of the many extraordinary and often contradictory claims concerning the spread and impact of P . megacephala and L . humile in Madeira . It seems improbable that no one noticed this problem before . Correcting these erroneous reports , however , would not add to the arguments of authors writing on how exotic ants can be highly destructive . Authors who questioned the validity of information on the impact of exotic ants in Madeira probably simply chose to omit this example . I also imagine that , outside the realm of anonymous reviews , many scientists feel that the benefits of correcting errors in the literature are often outweighed by the costs of raising the ire of corrected colleagues , who may later act as anonymous reviewers of their own papers and grant proposals ( see ANONYMOUS , 1999 ) . Directly criticizing the research of colleagues is often viewed as " non - collegia ! . " Most scientists probably have some awareness quotation error and citation copying in the scientific literature , but I believe few have much appreciation for how common or important these problems may be . The proliferation of quotation errors and secondary citation documented here parallels findings of earlier analyses ( e . g . , those concerning the " Ortega Hypothesis , " see HOERMAN & NOWICKE , 1995 ; SZAVA - KovATS , 2004 ) , and may be representative of general practices in the scientific literature . For example , HERNANDEZ & WHITE ( 1989 ) compared 1 , 189 direct quotes with their original sources and found 519 ( 43 . 7 % ) had one or more deviations . Based on the frequency ofrepeated errors in the citation of 12 highly cited papers published between 1969 and 1989 , Scientometrics 67 ( 2006 ) 363 J . K . WETTERER : Ant extinctions in Madeira SIMKIN & ROYCHOWDHURY ( 2005 ) estimated that about 70 - 90 % of scientific citations are copied from reference lists of other papers rather than from the original paper . If quotation error and citation copying are common when citing easily accessible , recent publications , these problems are probably even more common when authors cite old references that are difficult to acquire or written in foreign languages . Papers written in foreign languages may be mistranslated and are probably more likely to be left unread . One more problem In my analyses , I only considered how accurately secondhand sources represented the conclusions of others concerning exotic ants in Madeira . Another important consideration , however , is the reliability of the firsthand sources . Most scientists are probably guilty of citing unreliable and anecdotal information on occasion , particularly when data are scarce and when earlier conclusions match their own expectations . Although HEER ( 1852 ; 1856 ) did not make most of the dramatic observations later attributed to him , he did repeat some sensational ant stories . For example HEER ( 1852 ; 1856 ) reported this tale told to him by a Dr . Delacour about a dramatic impact of " wood " ants : " In the year 1834 , he says , a young man of respectable family , resting under a tree on the way from Tampico to Mexico , was attacked by the ants and completely eaten up . On the following day nothing was found but his skeleton , with the clothes . " Standards of evidence in science are now stricter than they were 150 years ago , and it is difficult to imagine an author today passing on this story as reliable information . But what about the relatively modest conclusions of HEER ( 1852 ; 1856 ) that virtually all houses in Funchal were infested with P . megacephala , and of FOREL ( 1895 , 1928 ) that L . humile had completely replaced P . megacephala as the house ant of Madeira ? Both claims are anecdotal and , I suspect , based on very little evidence . In my experience , it is not particularly easy to determine the relative prevalence of different ant species in other people ' s houses , unless you work as an exterminator . In June 2002 , I asked undergraduates at the University of Madeira in Funchal to collect ants from inside their homes . They brought me six species : Lasius grandis ( 4x ) , Monomorium carbonarium ( 3x ) , Plagioiepis schmitzii ( 3x ) , Monomorium subopacum ( Ix ) , L . humile ( I x ) , and Technomyrmex albipes ( Ix ) . Of these , only the last two are exotic to Madeira . I have found no study attempting to determine how often claims in the scientific literature are based on anecdotal observations without any quantitative data , nor how often unsupported claims are cited uncritically . Some recent papers have examined whether claims made in the abstracts of papers in the literature are actually supported by data in the papers ( e . g . , SIEBERS , 2001 ) . I hope this present paper encourages other researchers to pursue questions concerning the use and misuse of secondary sources in the scientific literature . I only request that these newly inspired researchers do not start their inquiries by examining shortcomings of my own published papers . 364 Scientometrics 67 ( 2006 ) J . K .

About L . humile , he wrote : " It displaces local species , and seems to have entirely exterminated Pheidole megacephala in Madeira " ( DONISTHORPE ( 1915 : 342 ; 1927a : 394 ) , citing WHEELER ( 1910 ) . ILLINGWORTH ( 1917 ) , in a paper on P . megacephala in Hawaii , wrote : " it is a rather common experience , in the tropics , to find that one species becomes dominant in a certain region , at the expense of all the other ant - fauna . A notable case ( Wheeler , 1906 ) is the supplanting of Pheidole megacephala , by the Argentine ant ( lridomyrmex humilis ) , in Madeira . " I believe most people would interpret this as indicating that L . humile became dominant at the expense of all other ants of Madeira . ILLINGWORTH ( 1917 ) also summarized much of HEER ( 1856 ) , using the translated phrasing found in HEER ( 1856 ) , rather than that in WHEELER ( l906a , 1910 ) , e . g . , " the whole south side of the island " ( in HEER , 1856 and ILLINGWORTH , 1917 ) versus " throughout the southern portion of the island " ( in WHEELER , 1906a ; 1910 ) , indicating he had read HEER ( 1856 ) . In a paper on the ants of Sicily , DONISTHORPE ( l927b ) wrote about L . humile " In Madeira it has exterminated the local species , " citing no source . In a review paper on exotic ants , WEBER ( 1939 ) wrote that " an introduced ant may even drive out an earlier migrant as Iridomyrmex humilis Mayr , a South American ant , drove out Pheidole megacephala from Madeira , " citing WHEELER ( 1906a ) as his source . In a book review of HASKINS ( 1939 ) , BRUES ( 1939 ) wrote : " several pages are devoted to a detailed account of two species ( Pheidole megacephala and Iridomyrmex humile ) that have spread widely in warm countries during recent times , driving out the indigenous ant - fauna over extensive areas that they have exploited . Finally , meeting in Madeira in a fight to the finish where the militant Pheidole had already taken possession , an unexpected outcome has been the usurpation of the island by the gentle Iridomyrmex which now holds sway after having completely ousted the earlier invaders . " In a note reporting the arrival of L . humile in Hawaii , ZIMMERMAN ( 1941 ) repeated WHEELER ' s ( 1934 ) quote ( see text ) , starting with " Should it eventually secure a foothold in the islands . . . " In a book on ants , GOETSCH ( 1953 in German ; 1957 in English ) wrote that " from 1882 on the same sort of battles that took place in my artificial nest must have raged on a large scale in the Azores and Madeira , for since that date , when the Argentine ant was introduced , the Pheidole has disappeared from Madeira " ( GOETSCH , 1957 : 44 ) , citing no source . GOETSCH ' S ( 1953 , 1957 ) arrival date of 1882 for L . humile in Madeira may have come from MARTINS ( 1907 ) . 368 Scientometrics 67 ( 2006 ) 1 . K . WETTERER : Ant extinctions in Madeira In a review paper on the Argentine ant , SKAIFE ( 1955 ) showed a map indicating that L . humile arrived in Madeira in 1905 . In a book on ants , SKAIFE ( 1961 : 7 ) wrote that after L . humile was collected in Argentina in 1866 , " nothing more was heard of the ant for twenty - five years , until 1891 it was reported as a nuisance in New Orleans . . . By 1905 [ L . humile ] had found its way to Madeira , and to Portugal by 1907 . In Madeira it wiped out another species , the brown house ant , Pheidole megacephala , which was also an invader from overseas and which had exterminated the native species before the Argentinian ' s arrival . " SKAIFE ( 1955 , 1961 ) did not cite any sources . The late date he listed for the arrival of L . humile in Madeira , I found in no other publication . SKAIFE ( 1955 , 1961 ) was clearly not aware of FOREL ( 1895 ) , SCHMITZ ( 1896 , 1897 ) , or STOLL ( 1898 ) . SKAIFE ( 1955 ) cited only one publication that mentioned ants in Madeira : NEWELL & BARBER ( 1913 ) . In a book on ants , LARSON & LARSON ( 1965 : 173 - 174 ) wrote : " Pheidole megacephala was imported into Madeira in the early 1800 ' s . Oswald Heer wrote of its conquest in 1852 . By this year it was the only ant to be found on the entire island , having destroyed all species of ant to be found previously endemic to the island . . . But , as these conquerors had vanquished their opponents , so were they to be conquered and eliminated . For into Madeira from South America came a second invader called the Argentine ant , lridomyrmex humilis . . . The Pheidole are gone today from Madeira , replaced by the Argentine ant . " In a monograph on ants of Europe and the Mediterranean region , BERNARD ( 1967 , but dated 1968 ) wrote ( in French ) " In Madeira and several other Atlantic islands , / . humilis succeeded in destroying Pheidole and other local kinds dominating previously , " citing no source . In a book on ants , COSTELLO ( 1968 , p . 120 ) wrote : " When the Argentine ants were introduce into Madeira the Pheidole ants disappeared . Elsewhere , the battle is still going on , " citing no source . In a paper on invasive ants in Hawaii , FLUKER & BEARDSLEY ( 1970 ) wrote : " / . humilis apparently eliminated P . megacephala from the Island of Madeira and the Canary Islands ca . 60 or 70 years ago , " citing WHEELER ( 1906a ) . In a paper on the impact of L . humile , ERICKSON ( 1972 , but dated 1971 ) wrote of P . megacephala : " in 1852 , in Funchal , the capital of Madeira , this species was itself displaced by I . humilis ( Stoll 1898 , Wheeler 1906 ) , " erroneously listing the date of Heer ' s paper on P . megacephala as the date of L . humile ' s displacement of this species . In a paper following up HASKINS & HASKINS ' ( 1965 ) work on ants in Bermuda , LIEBERBURG et al . ( 1975 ) wrote " on the island of Madeira during the last century ( Stoll 1898 ) , lridomyrmex replaced Pheidole within a period of 50 yr . However , the actual details of this replacement were never recorded . " Although LIEBERB URG et aI . ' s ( 1975 ) cited STOLL ( 1898 ) as the source , their wording was very similar to that of HASKINS & HASKINS ( 1965 ) , suggesting that they used this as their source of information . Scientometrics 67 ( 2006 ) 369 J . K . WETfERER : Ant extinctions in Madeira In a paper on ants in Hawaii , FELLERS & FELLERS ( 1981 ) wrote " Heer ( 1892 , in Wheeler 1910 ) reports that Argentine ants on the island of Madeira ( off the NW coast of Africa ) could be found under eight out of every 10 stones , " getting both the date and species in Heer ' s study wrong . FELLERS & FELLERS ( 1982 ) repeated the citation error " Heer 1892 in Wheeler 1910 , " but did not mention Madeira . In a paper on ants in Bermuda , HASKINS & HASKINS ( 1988 ) wrote : " by 1852 , judging by Heer ' s vivid account ( Heer 1856 ) [ Po megacephala ] had thoroughly occupied , among many other western European locations , the island of Madeira , exterminating a very large fraction ( if not all ) of the indigenous ant fauna . " HASKINS & HASKINS ( 1988 ) also described how in Bermuda , P . megacephala " behaved essentially as in Madeira , displacing the greater part of the indigenous ant fauna and ' blanketing ' the Islands . . . . its situation as a ubiquitous field and house ant closely resembled Heer ' s account of it in Madeira . " HASKINS & HASKINS ( 1988 ) further wrote that by 1882 L . humile " had found its way ( likewise as a ' tramp ' species exploiting human transport ) to Madeira , which it occupied , in competition with the resident P . megacephala . It was a successful ' occupation ' , and by 1898 , according to Stoll ( 1898 ) P . megacephala had completely disappeared from the island , leaving I . humilis as the sole ant reported . Nothing is known of further details of the explosive interaction between these species in this limited island environment . " The date of 1882 for the arrival of L . humile in Madeira may have come from MARTINS ( 1907 ) or GOETSCH ( 1953 , 1957 ) . Contrary to HASKINS & HASKINS ' ( 1988 ) assertion , P . megacephala is not known in Europe outside of houses ( X . Espadaler , pers . comm . ) . A 1990 paper on pest ants in Hawaii wrote that FLUKER & BEARDSLEY ( 1970 ) " concluded that the Argentine ant was unlikely to completely displace P . megacephala in Hawaii as it did in Madeira and the Canary Islands . " A 1994 paper on the spread of L . humile in Australia wrote that L . humile in Madeira " colonized most of island , eliminating main resident ant , " P . megacephala , citing STOLL ( 1898 ) . A 1996 paper on invasions by social insects wrote that P . megacephala displaced " several native ant species " on " Madei " [ sic ] , citing HASKINS & HASKINS ( 1965 ) as the source . A 1997 government - funded report on L . humile in Hawaii wrote that L . humile " typically predates on and displaces native invertebrates , such as in Madeira ( Stoll 1898 ) , " though STOLL ( 1898 ) never mentioned any native invertebrate . They continued : " the Argentine ant has even proven aggressive enough to displace other tramp species , as it has in Bermuda and Madeira where Pheidole megacephala was usurped . " A 2000 paper on the impact of P . megacephala in Australia wrote : " on the island of Madeira , the introduction and subsequent spread of P . megacephala in the mid f ) ineteenth century , resulted in the extermination of a large fraction of the native ant fauna ( Haskins & Haskins 1988 ) . Pheidole megacephala was in turn completely 370 Scientometrics 67 ( 2006 ) J . K . WElTERER : Ant extinctions in Madeira displaced by Linepithema humile ( the Argentine ant ) about a century later ( Haskins & Haskins 1965 ) . " The mid - 20th century displacement of P . megacephala reported here appears to be unique to this paper . A 2001 paper on the spread of L . humile wrote : " the earliest reported introduction occurred in 1882 on Madeira Island . Although new records continue to accumulate , many populations were established by the 1950s ( Table I ) " citing STOLL ( 1898 ) in Table 1 as the source of the date , though no date is found in Stoll ' s paper . Instead , I have found this date previously in GOETSCH ( 1953 ; 1957 ) and HASKINS & HASKINS ( 1988 ) . In a paper on the impact of L . humile on Santa Cruz Island , California , WETTERER et al . ( 2001 ) wrote : " If left unchecked , it seems likely that the L . humile populations will continue to spread until they occupy much of SCI , as they have on other islands of similar latitude that they have invaded , such as Madeira ( 32 " 45 ' N ; Schmitz 1896 ) and Bermuda ( 32°20 ' N ; Haskins & Haskins 1965 , 1988 ) . " Analyzing the distribution described by SCHMITZ ( 1896 ) , I now estimate that L . humile at its peak may have occupied - 10 % of Madeira . This does not really qualify as " much " of Madeira . A 2003 book on ants wrote of P . megacephala that " in some areas , especially islands such as Madeira , Culebrita , and the Dry Tortugas , they form a virtually continuous supercolony that excludes most other ant species , " citing no source . In a World Conservation Union report on invasive ants in the Pacific , the Pacific Invasive Ant Group ( PIAG ) wrote : " When introduced , [ L . humile ] is typically predatory toward , and displaces , native invertebrate species , such as in Madeira ( Stoll 1898 ) " ( PIAG , 2004 ) . Appendix 2 Additional secondary accounts without quotation errors In a report on L . humile in South Africa , LOUNSBURY ( 1909 ) wrote : " a recent letter from the Madeira Entomologist to this Office states that the ant is now the worst insect pest on the island . " In a paper promoting the use of ants as biological control agents , MORLEY ( 1939 ) wrote that the tropical fire ant , Solenopsis geminata " would lend itself to introduction into other countries , and would not like the Dolichoderine lridomyrmex humilis Mayr itself become a pest . This latter after replacing Pheidole megacephala Fore I as the ' house ant ' in Madeira , having been introduced , unintentionally , from the West Indies , spread also to Spain and Ireland . " In evaluating whether a particular ant species should be introduced , MORLEY ( 1939 ) wrote that one must ask : " Would the species to be introduced be likely to become a ' house pest ' ? ( e . g . , lridomyrmex humilis in Madeira . ) " Although MORLEY ' S ( 1939 ) suggested introductions of S . geminata were misguided , his Scientometrics 67 ( 2006 ) 371 J . K . WEITERER : Ant extinctions in Madeira speculations of the source of L . humile were almost certainly incorrect , and his credit of authorship of P . megacephaZa was incorrect , at least his portrayal of P . megacephala and L . humile as house pests in Madeira agreed with firsthand accounts . In a book on ants , MORLEY ( 1953 ) wrote : " In 1852 it was said that every single house in Funcha1 , capital of Madeira , had its colony of Pheidole megacephala . To - day most houses there still have their ' House Ants ' , but now the dreaded Argentine Ant , Iridomynnex humilis , has replaced the PheidoZe " ( p . 123 ) . MORLEY ( 1939 , 1953 ) cited no reference for the Madeira information , but in both works cited FOREL ( 1928 ) elsewhere . FOREL ( 1928 ) was probably MORLEY ' S ( 1939 , 1953 ) source , explaining why Morley accurately passed on information of Heer ' s and Schmitz ' accounts . In a note on the distribution of L . humile , SKAIFE ( 1962 ) mentioned that L . humile " is nowadays a harmful pest in the southern states of the United States , Madeira , Portugal , Spain , the Riviera , and Australia . " In a paper on the ants of the Azores , YARROW ( 1967 ) wrote of P . megacephala that " In Madeira this ant was at one time a real domestic menace until it was driven from this position at the end of the last century by the arrival of the ' Argentine Ant ' , Iridomynnex humilis ( Mayr ) . " Concerning L . humile , YARROW ( 1967 ) wrote " by 1893 it had replaced PheidoZe megacephala as the ' house ant ' in Madeira , " and " the Argentine ant , Iridomynnex humilis , which so rapidly overran Madeira seems for the time being to be no more than ' well established ' in the Azores . " Although YARROW ( 1967 ) cited no source for any of this information , he got the story basically correct , probably from WHEELER ( 1927 ) whom he cited for much other information . In his book on social insects , WILSON ( 1971 : 451 ) accurately wrote that " Iridomynnex humilis and Pheidole megacephala are wholely incompatible species , with humilis the usual if not invariable winner in such subtropical localities as Madeira , Oahu , and Bermuda , " citing no source . In two books on ants , HOLLDOBLER & WILSON ( 1990 : 400 ; 1994 : 64 ) wrote that L . Ilumile dominates disturbed habitats on the island of Madeira , citing no references , though domination in disturbed habitats does fit with SCHMITZ ' ( 1896 ) observations of L . humile dominating in houses . In a paper on exotic ants in Brazil , FOWLER et al . ( 1994 ) listed L . humile in Madeira as an example of an exotic ant that replaced another exotic ant , citing STOLL ( 1898 ) . In a paper on an exotic ant in the Pacific , JOURDAN et al . ( 2002 ) wrote of " the competitive replacement between P . megacephaZa and L . humile in Madeira ( Stoll 1898 ) . " In a paper on the ants in Florida , WETIERER & O ' HARA ( 2002 ) wrote : " Mutually exclusive distributions between pairs of dominant ant species have also been noted for many other species , such as between Ph . megacephala and Linepithema humile on Madeira ( Schmitz , 1896 ) and Bermuda ( Haskins & Haskins , 1965 ) .
