Related to Figure 2 . We applied a grouped dose - symmetric tilt scheme for cryo - ET data acquisition , where the goniometer is successively tilted in opposite directions ( Hagen et al . , 2017 ) . Four images were collected in succession in one direction ( relative to the untilted 0º image ) , followed by four images in the other direction , while moving from 0º to ±60º . Changing direction after every four images proved to be time - efficient , as well as dose - efficient , since high cumulated doses were restricted to high tilt images . This allowed discarding high tilt images without compromising the lower tilt images . Supplemental Figure S2 : Gallery of cryo - correlative microscopy and corresponding cryo - ET data . Related to Figures 2 and 3 . A : Single focal plane cryo - FM images , merge of red ( shown in magenta ) and green channels , rotated , cropped and scaled to match the corresponding intermediate magnification cryo - EM images shown in B . The coordinates of the Pil1 - GFP signals indicated by the white circle ( A ) , were transformed using the fiducial markers highlighted by the yellow circles in A and B . The centres of the green dashed circles ( B ) are the predicted positions of Pil1 - GFP signals of interest . Note that the white circles ( A ) in rows II , V and VI contain two Pil1 - GFP signals each . The white dashed rectangles correspond to the field of view imaged by cryo - ET , shown in C as a single virtual slice through the reconstructed tomogram . Dashed rectangles in C indicate the location of the eisosomes shown in D and E . The images in D and E are magnifications of the virtual slice shown in C , except for EI and EII , which are magnifications of different virtual slices than those shown in C . Green dashed boxes indicate eisosomes that are also shown in Figure 3 and that have resulted in interpretable 2D class averages of eisosomal as well as nearby plasma membrane . Due to a defect of the direct electron detector , the EM images have a stripe of faulty pixels . They appear as a narrow stripe of repeating image features apparent in some of the images shown in B . Images shown in EI and Figure 3BI , EII and Figure 3BII , DIV and Figure 3BIV , and EV and Figure 3BV , are details from the same image , respectively . Scale bars : 2 µm in A and B , 100 nm in C and 25 nm in D and E . Supplemental Figure S3 : Room - temperature correlative light and electron microscopy of Pil1 - GFP . Related to Figure 3 . Room - temperature correlative light and electron microscopy confirms that eisosomes correspond to furrow - like invaginations that are oriented at various angles relative to the plane of the plasma membrane , as well as shallow indentations of the plasma membrane .

Overlay of green ( Pil1 - GFP ) and far - red ( fiducial markers , shown in magenta ) signals . B : Virtual slices through scanning transmission electron microscopy tomograms acquired at the predicted positions of the Pil1 - GFP spots marked by white dashed circles in A . Scale bars : 1 µm in A , 50 nm in B .
