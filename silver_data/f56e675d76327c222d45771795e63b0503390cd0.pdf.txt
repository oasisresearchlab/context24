A s an aspiring engineer in the early 1970s , Lynne Kiorpes was easy to spot in her undergraduate classes . Among a sea of men , she and a handful of other women made easy targets for a particular professor at Northeastern University in Boston , Massachusetts . On the first day of class , “he looked around and said ‘I see women in the classroom . I don’t believe women have any business in engineering , and I’m going to personally see to it that you all fail’ . ” He wasn’t bluffing . All but one of the women in the class ultimately left engineering ; Kiorpes went on to major in psychology . Such blatant sexism is almost unthinkable today , says Kiorpes , now a neuroscientist at New York University . But Kiorpes , who runs several mentoring programmes for female stu - dents and postdoctoral fellows , says that subtle bias persists at most universities . And it drives some women out of science careers . By almost any metric , women have made great gains in closing the scientific gender gap , but female scientists around the world continue to face major challenges . Accord - ing to the US National Science Foundation , women earn about half the doctorates in science and engineering in the United States but comprise only 21 % of full science profes - sors and 5 % of full engineering professors . And on average , they earn just 82 % of what male scientists make in the United States — even less in Europe . Scientific leaders say that they continue to struggle with ways to level the playing field and entice more women to enter and stay in science . “We are not drawing from our entire intellectual capital , ” says Hannah Valantine , dean of leadership and diversity at the Stan - ford School of Medicine in California . “We’ve got to put on the accelerator to evoke social change . ” One of the most persistent problems is that a disproportionate fraction of qualified women drop out of science careers in the very early stages ( see ‘Women in science’ ) . A 2006 sur - vey of chemistry doctoral students by the Royal Society of Chemistry in London , for example , found that more than 70 % of first - year female students said that they planned a career in research ; by their third year , only 37 % had that goal , compared with 59 % of males 1 . Many experts say that a big factor driving this trend is the lack of role models in the upper divisions of academia , which have been slow to change . The Royal Society of Chemis - try has found , for instance , that female chem - istry students are more likely than males to express low self - confidence and to report dis - satisfaction with mentorship 2 . Female students “conclude consciously and unconsciously that these careers are not for them because they don’t see people like them” , suggests Valantine . “That effect is very , very powerful — this sense of not belonging . ” The attrition continues at later stages . In biology , for example , women comprised 36 % of assistant professors and only 27 % of tenure candidates in a 2010 study by the US National Research Council 3 . “We’re not talking about a lack of talent here . Part of the story is that women leave earlier . In a sense , they give up on an academic career , ” says Curt Rice , vice - president of research and development at the University of Tromsø in Norway , who has studied gender equality in US and European universities . FAMILY VALUES Many of the UK chemistry students viewed research as an all - consuming endeavour that was incompatible with raising a family . Meet - ing the demanding schedule of academic research can seem daunting for both mothers and fathers . But family choices seem to weigh more heavily on the career goals of women . Law professor Mary Ann Mason at the University of California , Berkeley , and her colleagues have found 4 that male and female postdocs without children are equally likely to decide against research careers , each leav - ing at a rate of about 20 % . But female postdocs who become parents or plan to have children abandon research careers up to twice as often as men in similar circumstances . “The plan to have children in the future , or already having them , is responsible for an enor - mous drop - off in the women who apply for tenure - track jobs , ” says Wendy Williams , a psy - chologist at Cornell University in Ithaca , New York . Furthermore , women who do become faculty members in astronomy , physics and biology tend to have fewer children than their male colleagues — 1 . 2 versus 1 . 5 , on average — and also have fewer children than they desire 5 . In response to these concerns , many uni - versities have taken steps to establish family - friendly policies such as providing child - care assistance and extending tenure clocks for new MIND THE GENDER GAP Despite improvements , female scientists continue to face discrimination , unequal pay and funding disparities .

In some European countries , women outnumber men in science degrees but there is significant variation between nations and fields . POSTGRADUATE POSITIONS A 2009 survey of postdoctoral fellows at the University of California showed that women who had children or planned to have them were more likely to consider leaving research . EARLY CAREER Female representation among science and engineering faculty members in the United States has lagged behind gains in graduate education , in part because many women do not apply for tenure - track jobs . But women who do apply are more likely than men to receive interviews and offers . RISING IN THE RANKS A study of US science departments showed that women were more successful than men in gaining tenure between 2002 and 2004 . In Europe as in the United States , the gender gap is greater among senior than among junior faculty members .

Shirley Tilghman , president of Prince - ton University in New Jersey , believes that such initiatives provide crucial support for women , but that other solutions are still needed . “I don’t think there’s a single obstacle , ” she says . “I think there’s a whole series of phenomena that add up . ” LIVE ISSUE At Yale University in New Haven , Connecticut , microbiologist Jo Handelsman is one of many researchers who think that gender discrimina - tion continues to be a significant part of the problem . In a much - talked - about experiment last year 6 , her team showed that science faculty members of both sexes exhibit unconscious biases against women . Handelsman’s group asked 127 professors of biology , chemistry and physics at 6 US universities to evaluate the CVs of two fictitious college students for a job as a laboratory manager . The professors said they would offer the student named Jennifer US $ 3 , 730 less per year than the one named John , even though the CVs were identical . The scientists also reported a greater willingness to mentor John than Jennifer . “If you extrapolate that to all the interactions that faculty have with students , it becomes very frightening , ” says Handelsman . Her findings match well with the results of a survey 7 done in 2010 by the American Asso - ciation for the Advancement of Science . Of the 1 , 300 or so people who responded , 52 % of women said that they had encountered gender 18 % AVERAGE PAY GAP ALL POSITIONS $ 65 , 000 $ 50 , 000 THE FUNDING GAP Women are earning an increasing share of research grants from the US National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) but the average size of their awards has consistently lagged behind what men receive . BIOLOGY 2012 2002 2012 2002 THE SALARY GAP Female scientists in the United States earn much less than men , on average , with the difference varying strongly by field . $ 79 , 000 $ 62 , 000 CHEMISTRY $ 89 , 000 $ 54 , 000 PHYSICS AND ASTRONOMY 2008 median salaries 2008 median salaries 2008 median salaries NUMBER OF NIH RESEARCH GRANTS 30 , 768 13 , 025 $ 507 , 279 $ 421 , 385 AVERAGE SIZE OF GRANT NUMBER OF NIH RESEARCH GRANTS 31 , 801 10 , 199 $ 403 , 047 $ 330 , 169 AVERAGE SIZE OF GRANT 24 % Proportion going to women 30 % Proportion going to women MEN WOMEN KEY { bias during their careers , compared with just 2 % of men . Still , other concrete evidence of bias is hard to find . Some measures show female scientists outperforming male rivals in landing inter - views and job offers early in their careers . The National Research Council study 3 showed that women accounted for 19 % of the interview pool and received 32 % of job offers for tenure - track electrical - engineering positions . Women fared just as well as men in tenure evaluations , but female assistant professors in many disci - plines seemed less likely to reach tenure con - sideration compared with men . Women face even more daunting odds in Spain . Men are 2 . 5 times more likely to rise to the rank of full professor than female col - leagues with comparable age , experience and publication records 8 . Disparities can also be found in grant fund - ing in some countries . In one frequently cited study 9 , Christine Wennerås and Agnes Wold at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden found in 1997 that female applicants for postdoctoral fellowships had to score 2 . 5 times higher on an index of publication impact to be judged the same as men . Several groups , such as the UK Medical Research Council and biomedical research charity the Wellcome Trust , have since inves - tigated their grant programmes and found negligible or very subtle effects of gender 10 . The Canadian Medical Research Council found no differences in success rate in most of its research grant programmes , but reported lower success rates for women in some training grants 11 . In the United States , women are slightly more suc - cessful than men in obtaining grants from the National Science Foundation , but the trend is reversed for the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) . The NIH also gives women smaller awards on average ( see ‘The funding gap’ ) . Information provided to Nature by the NIH through a Freedom of Information Act request indicates that the percentage of women on review panels has improved marginally over the past decade , from 25 % in 2003 to 30 % in 2012 . Those figures roughly parallel the per - centage of women applying for and receiving grants in that time . PAY PROBLEMS The inequalities also extend to salaries . In the European Union , female scientists earned on average between 25 % and 40 % less than male scientists in the public sector in 2006 ( ref . 12 ) . Although the average pay gap is smaller in the United States , the disparity is particularly large in physics and astronomy , where women earn 40 % less than men . For young academic scientists , however , those differences may be fading . The National Research Council found an 8 % pay gap at the level of full science and engineering professors but no significant differences among junior fac - ulty members 3 . Some experts argue , however , that the salary gap may reflect other continued trends , such as the fact that a disproportionate share of women move into non - tenure posi - tions or faculty jobs at lower - status universities . Tilghman says that Princeton and many other universities have grown increasingly conscious of the need to track and rectify gen - der gaps in salary and other institutional sup - port . “Absolutely , it needs eternal vigilance , ” she says . “But we’re in a much better place . ” ■ Helen Shen is an intern with Nature in Washington DC . 1 .
