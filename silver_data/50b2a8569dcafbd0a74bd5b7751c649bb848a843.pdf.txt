The folate receptor is clustered on the sur - face of MA104 cells in association with caveolae . This relationship is thought to be essential for the proper internalization and recycling of the receptor during the delivery of 5 - methyltetrahydrofolate to the cytoplasm of folate - depleted cells . Both the clustered organization of the receptor and the integrity of caveolae are dis - rupted when cells are deprived of cholesterol . We now show that cholesterol depletion of MA104 cells markedly reduces the rate of 5 - methyltetrahydrofolate internalization and causes a 70 % decline in the num - ber of receptors present in the internal , recycling com - partment . This effect is consistent with morphologic data showing that cholesterol - depleted MA104 cells have a reduced number of caveolae as well as fewer receptors per caveolae . T HE folate receptor is a glycosyl - phosphatidylinositol ( GPI ) ~ anchored membrane protein ( 12 , 13 ) that me - diates the high affinity uptake of 5 - methyltetrahydro - folate into cells . The internalization process involves a novel endocytic pathway ( 2 ) that requires four steps ( 8 - 11 ) : ( a ) binding of the vitamin to the receptor ; ( b ) internalization of the vitamin - receptor complex into a membrane bound compartment ; ( c ) dissociation of the vitamin from the receptor and movement across the membrane into the cyto - plasm ; and ( d ) covalent addition of multiple glutamic acid residues to the vitamin . The presence of the receptor af - fords cells greater than a 30 - fold efficiency in 5 - methyltetra - hydrofolate uptake ( 11 ) , which allows tissue culture cells to divide when grown in physiologic concentrations of the vitamin ( 14 ) . Biochemical ( 10 ) and immunofluorescence ( 19 ) experi - ments have shown that the folate receptor cyclically moves in and out of a membrane - bound compartment . Immunogold cytochemistry demonstrated that receptors are clustered in association with caveolae ( 19 ) , a membrane specialization that previously has been shown to transport molecules across endothelial cells ( 21 ) . Caveolae are present on the surface of most cells ( 23 ) and are the likely sites of folate receptor in - ternalization ( 19 ) . The formation of folate receptor clusters is dependent on membrane cholesterol ( 18 ) . Cholesterol binding drugs such as filipin disperse the receptors in the plane of the mem - brane , even if the cells are first incubated in the presence of polyclonal , anti - receptor IgG and fixed with formaldehyde . Lowering the cellular concentration of cholesterol also causes receptors to become unclustered . Receptor cluster - 1 . Abbreviations used in this paper : GPI , glycosyl - phosphatidylinositol ; LDL , low density lipoprotein . ing , therefore , is dependent upon the lipid phase of the mem - brane . Caveolae have a distinctive , striated coat that decorates the cytoplasmic face of the membrane ( 16 , 20 ) . The coat is not removed by treatment with either high salt or carbonate ( 20 ) . This suggests that , unlike clathrin - coated pits , the visible portion of the coat consists of integral membrane protein ( s ) . Recently , we identified a protein component of the coat called caveolin ( 20 ) . It too behaves like an integral mem - brane protein . Despite the integral nature of the coat pro - tein ( s ) , when isolated plasma membranes are exposed to cholesterol binding drugs , the coat disassembles and caveo - lin scarers with the remnants of the coat material ( 20 ) . Also , cholesterol depletion markedly reduces the number of caveo - lae in MA104 cells ( 18 ) . The profound effects of cholesterol depletion on both the organization of the folate receptor and the structure of caveo - lae predicts that this treatment should affect the receptor - mediated uptake of folate . The current study shows that when the cholesterol content of MA104 cells is lowered by > 50 % , the rate of 5 - methyltetrahydrofolate delivery to the cell interior is reduced by 50 % and the number of receptors in the internal , recycling compartment is reduced by 70 % .

Human lipoprotein - deficient serum ( d > 1 . 215 g / ml ) was prepared as previously described ( 6 ) . Tissue Culture and Cholesterol Depletion MA104 cells , a monkey kidney epithelial cell line , were grown as previ - ously described ( 9 ) . 1 . 5 x 105 cells were seeded into a T - 25 culture flask and grown for 2 d in folate - free M199 supplemented with 0 . 68 mM gluta - mine and 5 % ( vol / vol ) FBS ( medium A ) . Cells were then transferred to folate ~ free M199 supplemented with 0 . 68 mM glutamine and 5 % lipoprotein deficient serum ( medium B ) containing either 200 / tM mevalonate or 200 # M mevalonate plus 25 # M compactin and cultured for an additional 2 . 5 d ( 60 h ) . The low concentration of mevalonate was required to maintain cell viability during the 60 - h incubation . For indirect immunofluorescence ex - periments , 5 x 104 cells were seeded onto coverslips in 35 - mm dishes and grown under cholesterol depletion conditions as described above . Cells were counted using a standard hemocytometer . lmmunofluorescence Cells were chilled to 4 ~ for 20 min , rinsed with ice - cold medium C ( Folate - free Mt99 , 0 . 68 mM glutamiue , 20 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 4 , and 0 . 15 % crystalline BSA ) and incubated with 25 # g / ml of monoclonal anti - folate receptor IgG ( 5 ) , diluted in medium C , for 1 h at 4 ~ Cells were rinsed with buffer A ( PBS plus 0 . 15 % crystalline BSA ) and then fixed with 3 % paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min . After the indicated incubation , cells were rinsed with buffer A and processed to localize mouse IgG with rabbit anti - monse IgG conjugated to fiuorescein isothiocyanate for 1 h at 4 " C as previously described ( 19 ) . Folate Binding and Uptake Folate binding and accumulation were measured as previously described ( 8 , 9 ) . On day five of cell growth , the medium was removed by aspiration and 1 . 5 ml of medium D ( Folate - free M199 , 20 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 4 , and 0 . 68 mM glutamine ) were added to each T - 25 flask . The indicated type of radio - labeled folate was added to the dish in the presence and absence of 100 - fold unlabeled folate of the same type , and the cells were incubated as indicated in the figure legends . For the measurement of folate binding using 3Hfolic acid , the medium was removed by aspiration at the end of the incubation . After rinsing with 2 x 5 ml PBS , folate was released from the cells by wash - ing rapidly for 30 s with 2 ml of acid saline ( 0 . 15 M NaCI , adjusted to pH 3 with glacial acetic acid ) followed by a rinse with 1 . 5 mi of PBS . The radio - labeled folate in the acid saline plus the rinse equaled the acid - releasable fraction of folate . The cells were removed from the 1 " - 25 flask by addition of 1 mi 0 . 1 N NaOH for at least 10 rain at room temperature followed by rinsing with 2 ml of PBS . To measure the membrane and cytoplasmic 3Hfolic acid , we used the following procedures at 4 ~ At the end of in - cubation , cells were chilled on ice , and the medium was removed by aspira - tion . The cells were washed with 2 x 5 ml ice - cold PBS and 1 . 5 mi of bullet B ( 10 mM Tris - base , pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 02 mg / mi leupeptin and aprotinin , and 1 t ~ M VL - 5 - methyltetrahydrofolic acid ) was added to each I " - 25 flask at 4 ~ and the flasks were placed at - 80 ~ for at least 15 rain . After the freezing step , the cells were placed on an ice tray . The dissolved r was aspirated , each flask was rinsed with 1 ml of buffer B , and the two samples were com - bined . The combined extracts were centrifuged for 20 rain at 100D00 g in a TL - 100 centrifuge using a TLA 100 . 3 rotor ( Beckman Instruments , Inc . , Palo Alto , CA ) to separate the membrane fraction ( pellet ) from the cyto - plasmic fraction ( supematant fluid ) . The addition of unlabeled folate to the buffer B prevented cytoplasmic 3Hfolate from binding to unoccupied receptors on the membrane . Radioactivity was measured by liquid scintilla - tion counting using a Packard Tri - carb 1900A liquid scintillation analyzer ( Packard Instrument Co . , Downers Grove , IL ) . LDL Binding and Uptake On day five of cell growth , the medium was removed by aspiration and the cells were washed with 5 ml of PBS . Two mi of MEM supplemented with 2 mg / ml of BSA and 100 U / ml of penicillin / streptomycin ( medium E ) were added to each 60 - mm dish . 125I - LDL ( 10 pg / ml , specific activity , 350 - 456 cpm / ng ) was added to the dish in the presence and absence of 500 # g / ml of unlabeled low density lipoprotein ( LDL ) , and the cells were incubated at 37 ~ for 4 h . The surface bound , internalized , and degraded LDL were measured by the method of Goldstein et al . ( 6 ) . Cholesterol Assay Cholesterol measurements were made using a modification of the method of Heider and Boyett ( 7 ) . Cells were removed from the T - 25 flask with 1 ml trypsin - EDTA and transferred to a conical graduated centrifuge tube . The cells were washed three times by suspending them in PBS , centrifuging at 800 g for 5 rain , and aspirating the supernatant fluid . Isopropyl alcohol ( 0 . 5 ml ) was added to the cell pellet and the sample was sonicated with 3 x 30 Joules on a Vibra Cell ( sonics & Materials Inc . , Danbury , CN ) soni - cator . After centrifugation for 15 rain at 800 g the clear supernatant was decanted and an aliquot was taken for cholesterol analysis . The residue was dissolved in 0 . 1 N NaOH and an aliquot was taken for protein determi - nation . The isopropyl alcoholic solutions of standards , samples , and blank ( isopropyl alcohol alone ) were treated in a similar manner . An aliqout of 2 ml of reagent A ( 0 . 05 M sodium phosphate buffer , pH 7 . 0 , 0 . 16 U / mi cho - lesterol ester hydrolase , 0 . 08 U / ml cholesterol oxidase , 30 U / ml HRP , 5 mM sodium tanrocholate , 0 . 08 % Triton X - 100 , and 0 . 6 mg / ml p - hydroxyphenyl - acetic acid ) was added to a 10 x 75 mm disposable glass test tube to which 200 ~ l of the isoprovYt alcoholic solution was added and mixed . The mix - tures were incubated at 37 ~ for 30 rain in a shaking water bath and then 350 ~ l of 0 . 5 N NaOH was added and mixed . Samples were placed in a 1 - cm light path cuvette and fluorescence was measured with a spectrofluorometer ( model 8000C ; SLM Instruments Inc . , Urbana , IL ) with an excitation wavelength of 325 nm and emission wavelength of 415 nm . Other Assays All protein measurements were determined by the method of Bradford ( 4 ) using BSA as a standard . Results Distribution of Folate Receptor Cells can be depleted of cholesterol by allowing them to con - sume endogenous stores of sterol through repeated cell divi - sions . 60 h of growth without an exogenous or endogenous source of cholesterol routinely reduced total sterols in MA 104 cells from 5 . 86 # g / 10 s cells to 2 . 23 tzg / 106 cells ( 62 % decrease ) . This treatment did not affect either cell viability or morphology . Further lowering the cholesterol concentra - tion caused cell death . Immunofluorescence showed that the degree of folate receptor unclustering among the cells was quite heteroge - neous ( Fig . 1 ) . Some cells had normal - appearing receptor clusters ( compare Fig . l , A with B ) but other cells ( Fig . 1 C ) in the same dish had smaller clusters with diffuse fluores - cence across the membrane . Using these examples as ex - tremes , we found that ~ 60 % of the cells showed some de - gree of receptor unclustering . Inhibition of l ~ HFolic Acid Internalization The high affinity ligand for the folate receptor , folic acid , re - mains bound to the receptor as it moves in and out of the cell ( 9 ) . The effects of cholesterol depletion on the relative rate of 3Hfolic acid delivery to an internal compartment at 37 ~ is shown in Fig . 2 ( dotted lines ) . Control cells ( o , Fig . 2 ) internalized folate at 0 . 832 pmol / h / mg of protein . By con - trast , the rate of internalization in cholesterol deplete cells ( o , Fi ~ . 2 ) was only 0 . 405 pmol / h / mg of protein ( a 52 % de - The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume ItS , 1992 64 Figure 1 .

Con - trol cells ( o , Fig . 3 , A and B ) and cholesterol deplete cells ( . , Fig . 3 , A and B ) were incubated in the presence of [ 3H ] folic acid at 4 ~ The cells were warmed to 37 ~ and the amount present in either an internal compartment ( Fig . 3 A ) or on the cell surface ( Fig . 3 B ) was measured at various times . Cholesterol depletion had a nearly reciprocal , inhibi - tory effect on the rate of [ 3H ] folic acid internalization ( compare (cid:12)9 with o , Fig . 3 A ) and the rate of pH ] folic acid loss from the cell surface ( compare (cid:12)9 with o , Fig . 3 B ) . In this experiment we observed a much greater inhibition than in other trials : the rate of internalization was inhibited ~ 85 % while the rate of loss was inhibited ~ 65 % . Receptor recycling is necessary for the sustained uptake of folate ( 9 ) . The early plateau of [ 3H ] folic acid internaliza - tion seen in Fig . 2 ( - , - ) prompted us to analyze the effects of cholesterol depletion on recycling ( Fig . 4 ) . Control and cholesterol - deplete cells incubated in the presence of [ 3H ] - folic acid for 4 h at 37 ~ had both internal and external re - ceptors labeled . Treatment of these cells with an acid wash removed [ 3H ] folic acid from external receptors ( first wash , 100 % ; Fig . 4 , A and B ) but not internal receptors . Incubat - ing the cells at 37 ~ for 30 min followed by chilling and acid stripping ( second acid wash , Fig . 4 , A and B ) removed [ 3H ] folic acid that returned from internal sites during the period . When this procedure was repeated three more times ( third , fourth , and fifth acid wash , Fig . 4 , A and B ) , any ad - ditional ligand that recycled to the cell surface was removed . A decreasing amount of ligand returned to the cell surface of both cells with each repetition , indicating that the internal pool of [ ~ H ] folic acid became depleted . The total amount of internal pH ] folic acid that came to the cell surface in control cells equaled 80 % ( sum of acid wash 2 - 5 , Fig . 4 A ) of the amount initially exposed at the cell surface ( first wash , 100 % ; Fig . 4 A ) . This corresponds to a 1 : 0 . 8 ratio of external to internal receptors . By contrast , in cholesterol - depleted cells only 30 % of what was initially bound returned ( sum of acid wash 2 - 5 , Fig . 4 , ) , which corresponds to a 1 : 0 . 3 ratio of external to internal receptors .

The surface - bound ( heparin releasable ) and internalized ( heparin resistant plus degraded ) nnI - LDL were measured by the method of Goldstein et al . ( 6 ) . terol - deprived cells . Incubating the cells in the presence of compactin plus serum lacking LDL inhibited uptake by 45 % ( compare control o , with cholesterol deplete e , Fig . 7 ) . The uptake rate was restored to near normal when the cells received LDL as a source of cholesterol 24 h before the mea - surements ( ~ , Fig . 7 ) . The internalization index is the amount of a ligand inter - nalized in a period divided by the amount bound to receptors at the cell surface . The index measures the efficiency of up - take by a receptor - mediated process ( 1 ) . The folate receptor is not internalized by clathrin - coated pits in MA104 cells even though LDL receptors do use this route ( 19 ) . For this reason , we compared the effects of cholesterol depletion on the internalization index for LDL and folate ( Table I ) . This treatment decreased the internalization index for LDL by ' ~ 13 % , even though a lack of cholesterol caused a five - to sixfold increase in the number of LDL receptors . By con - trast , cholesterol depletion reduced the internalization index for 5 - methyltetrahydrofolate an average of 41 % . These re - suits also show that folate internalization in MA104 ceils is far less efficient than LDL internalization . Discussion The results of this study functionally connect together two previous studies showing that both folate receptor clustering ( 18 ) and the structure of eaveolae ( 20 ) are dependent on membrane cholesterol . The impaired folate uptake observed in cholesterol - deprived cells can be directly attributed to the disruption of these two organizational features of the plasma membrane . Cholesterol depletion had several effects on the behavior of the folate receptor : as judged by ligand binding , a 40 % reduction in the total number of receptors ; a shift in the steady distribution of surface membrane receptors so a greater proportion were external ; and a markedly slowed in - ternalization rate . An alteration in receptor traffic from the Chang et al . Cholesterol Required for Folate Internalization 67 Golgi apparatus to the cell surface can account for the first effect , although we do not have any direct evidence concern - ing the fate of newly synthesized receptors . The second effect can be attributed to the smaller size of each receptor cluster . This would result in fewer receptors over each caveolae , thus reducing the number of receptors available for internaliza - tion . Fewer receptors to internalize would reduce the size of the internal receptor pool at steady state . Finally , cholesterol depletion has been shown to reduce the number of caveolae ( 18 ) . Fewer caveolae available for taking up receptors would cause a slower rate of folate internalization . Other evidence also indicates that cholesterol - depleted cells have fewer functional caveolae . First , receptor recy - cling was unaffected by cholesterol depletion even though there were fewer internal receptors ( Fig . 3 B ) . This is consis - tent with there being a residual population of functional cav - eolae capable of both internalizing receptors and returning them to the cell surface . Second , in normal cells only a sub - population of caveolae are able to function at low tempera - ture ( 9 ) . We observed that at both 37 and 8 ~ there was a 70 % decline in the number of internalized receptors in cholesterol - depleted cells ( Fig . 5 ) . Therefore , in both con - trol and cholesterol - depleted cells low temperature appears to inactivate a constant percentage of those caveolae that are functional at 37 ~ Indirect immunofluorescence staining for folate receptor clusters showed that not all cells were equally affected by the cholesterol depletion protocol . We attribute this to an in - complete removal of cholesterol from the cell population . The functional caveolae as well as the normally clustered receptors most likely were enriched on the surface of cells that had not responded to the cholesterol lowering condi - tions . This heterogeneity accounts for why this protocol does not completely inhibit folate receptor internalization . Other studies have shown that a variation in the cholesterol content of the cell membrane can alter the rate of transmem - brane ion transport ( 3 ) . Therefore , the altered transport of 5 - methyltetrahydrofolate observed in cholesterol - depleted cells could have been due to changes in the function of the anion carrier that allows 5 - methyltetrahydrofolate to reach the cytoplasm . The parallel reduction in the rates of both 3Hfolic acid internalization and 3H - 5 - methyltetrahydro - folate delivery to the cytoplasm argues that the primary effect of cholesterol depletion is on the function of receptors in caveolae . Cholesterol depletion reduced the internalization index of 5 - methyltetrahydrofolate ( Table I ) , which is expected if receptor function is impaired . The LDL receptor internali - zation index , by contrast , was much less inhibited by this treatment . A requirement for cholesterol is expected for coated pit function because it is abundant in endosomal membranes ( 15 ) and the infectivity of Semliki Forest virus , which enter cells through coated pits , is inhibited in cholesterol - depleted cells ( 17 ) . Nevertheless , these results indicate that a clear difference exists in the cholesterol re - quirement of these two endocytic pathways . We do not know how cholesterol controls folate receptor clustering . On the other hand , the sterol may have its effect on caveolae function by altering membrane fluidity or reduc - ing the ability of the caveolae to seal off from the extracellu - lar space . Previous studies have found evidence for the pres - ence of high concentrations of cholesterol around the rim of each caveolae ( 22 ) . Conceivably this cholesterol is essential for membrane - membrane interactions that are necessary for caveolae internalization . The receptor - mediated uptake of folate involves a novel endocytic pathway called potocytosis ( 2 ) . A model for this pathway proposes that many different GPI - anchored mem - brane proteins are able to generate high concentrations of physiologically important , low molecular weight molecules within closed caveolae . These molecules then move across the caveolae membrane by a carrier - mediated process . The effect of cholesterol depletion on folate uptake directly tests the model by showing that when sequestration in caveolae is impaired , the delivery of 5 - methyltetrahydrofolate to the cytoplasm of the cell is inhibited . Cholesterol depletion may be a useful method for identifying other examples of GPI - anchored membrane proteins that deliver molecules to ceils by potocytosis . We would like to thank Catherine A .
