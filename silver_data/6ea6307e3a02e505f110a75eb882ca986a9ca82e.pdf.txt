Uncovering the similarities and differences of these two activation mechanisms is fundamental to understanding the regulation and function of Arp2 / 3 . Analysis of individual filaments reveals that the catalytic VCA domain of WASP , N - WASP and WASH , accelerate the Arp2 / 3 - mediated nucleation of linear filaments by SPIN90 , in addition to their known branch - promoting activity . Unexpectedly , these VCA domains also destabilize existing branches , as well as SPIN90 - Arp2 / 3 at filament pointed ends . Furthermore , cortactin and GMF , which respectively stabilize and destabilize Arp2 / 3 at branch junctions , have a similar impact on SPIN90 - activated Arp2 / 3 . However , unlike branch junctions , SPIN90 - Arp2 / 3 at the pointed end of linear filaments is not destabilized by piconewton forces , and does not become less stable with time . It thus appears that linear and branched Arp2 / 3 - generated filaments respond similarly to regulatory proteins , albeit with quantitative differences , and that they differ greatly in their responses to aging and to mechanical stress . These results indicate that SPIN90 - and VCA - activated Arp2 / 3 complexes adopt similar yet non - identical conformations , and that their turnover in cells may be regulated differently . 2 Introduction Branched actin filament networks , such as the ones found in the lamellipodia of migrating cells , or in endocytic patches , are a hallmark example of dynamic actin networks in cells . Branches result from the activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex by the VCA domains of nucleation - promoting factors ( NPFs ) , such as WASP or WAVE ( See ( Gautreau et al . , 2022 ) for a review ) . The VCA domain binds to the Arp2 / 3 complex via its CA domain , and recruits an actin monomer ( G - actin ) via its V - domain ( also known as WH2 domain ) . Two VCA domains can bind to the same Arp2 / 3 complex , and activate it more efficiently ( Padrick et al . , 2011 ; Zimmet et al . , 2020 ) . Following the binding of this large complex to the side of a pre - existing filament , commonly called the ‘mother’ filament , the VCA domains detach , thereby allowing the elongation of the branch ( Smith et al . , 2013 ) . Actin subunits are added at the dynamic ‘barbed’ end of the branchs’ , while its less dynamic ‘pointed’ end is stabilized and connected to the mother filament by the Arp2 / 3 complex . The Arp2 / 3 complex can also be activated by the protein WISH / DIP / SPIN90 , thereafter referred to as SPIN90 ( Wagner et al . , 2013 ) . The binding of SPIN90 to the Arp2 / 3 complex results in the nucleation of an actin filament that elongates freely at the barbed end , while SPIN90 - Arp2 / 3 remains attached to the pointed end . This activation mechanism generates de novo linear filaments , in the absence of a pre - existing mother filament . The binding site of SPIN90 on Arp2 / 3 does not overlap with the binding sites of VCA but sits in the region where the mother filament would bind , in the VCA - induced branching reaction ( Luan et al . , 2018 ) . Consistent with this , dip1 and wsp1 , the fission yeast homologs of SPIN90 and WASP , respectively , can simultaneously bind and co - activate the Arp2 / 3 complex , to generate linear filaments ( Balzer et al . , 2020 ) . During endocytosis in yeast , linear SPIN90 - nucleated filaments provide the initial mother filaments that will ‘prime’ the formation of branched networks ( Balzer et al . , 2020 , 2019 ; Basu and Chang , 2011 ) . In contrast , in the cortex of animal cells , SPIN90 - induced nucleation decreases the branching density and favors the rapid elongation of filaments by formin mDia1 ( Cao et al . , 2020 ) . It thus appears that , depending on the context , the two activation machineries of the Arp2 / 3 complex can synergize or compete . Whether they can be regulated independently is an open question : can one activation machinery be stimulated or inhibited without similarly affecting the other ? It was also shown that formin mDia1 could bind to the SPIN90 - activated Arp2 / 3 , indicating that it differs from the Arp2 / 3 complex in nascent branches ( Cao et al . , 2020 ) . The high - resolution cryo - EM structures of Arp2 / 3 bound to SPIN90 ( dip1 from yeast ) , and of Arp2 / 3 at branch junctions in cells , indicate that Arp2 / 3 undergoes similar conformation changes in both activation mechanisms ( Fäßler et al . , 2020 ; Shaaban et al . , 2020 ) . Small differences in inter - subunit contacts could also be detected ( Fäßler et al . , 2020 ) . Understanding whether these conformational differences give rise to different responses to regulatory factors is a fundamental question that requires further investigation . 3 An important aspect of Arp2 / 3 regulation is the control of the stability of Arp2 / 3 - generated filaments . With time , branches detach from mother filaments . Debranching is favored by the hydrolysis of ATP within the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Dayel and Mullins , 2004 ; Le Clainche et al . , 2003 ) . Debranching can be modulated by proteins interacting with Arp2 / 3 : branch junctions are stabilized by cortactin , and destabilized by GMF ( Gandhi et al . , 2010 ; Weaver et al . , 2001 ) . In addition , debranching is accelerated by mechanical tension applied to the branch ( Pandit et al . , 2020 ) . The impact of these factors on SPIN90 - activated Arp2 / 3 is an open question . More generally , the stability of SPIN90 - Arp2 / 3 at the pointed end , which is important to understand the reorganization and disassembly of actin filament networks , remains to be established . Here , we address these questions using purified proteins in single - filament experiments , using microfluidics and TIRF microscopy . We show that Arp2 / 3 nucleation is similarly stabilized by cortactin and destabilized by GMF , when activated either by VCA or SPIN90 to generate branches or linear filaments , respectively . Yet key differences , in particular regarding their sensitivity to mechanical stress and to Arp2 / 3 aging , indicate that the Arp2 / 3 complex adopts different conformations when activated by these two mechanisms . Results Experiments were performed at 25°C , using actin from rabbit skeletal muscle , Arp2 / 3 from bovine brain , and recombinant mammalian isoforms of other proteins ( see Methods ) VCA enhances the nucleation of linear filaments by SPIN90 - Arp2 / 3 We first sought to verify that , as with their yeast homologs ( Balzer et al . , 2020 ) , mammalian VCA and SPIN90 can co - activate the Arp2 / 3 complex to generate linear filaments . To do so , we exposed surface - anchored SPIN90 to the Arp2 / 3 complex , and subsequently flowed in solutions of profilin : actin complex and different concentrations of VCA into the microfluidics chamber . Since the outcome of these experiments is very sensitive to small variations in protein concentration , we have taken advantage of a microfluidics assay to simultaneously perform experiments and control experiments , in two different regions of the same microchamber to minimize variations between experiments ( see Methods , Fig 1A ) ( Jégou et al . , 2011 ; Wioland et al . , 2022 , 2020 ) . We found that the presence of VCA domains from either WASP , N - WASP or WASH , all induce a faster nucleation of filaments from SPIN90 - Arp2 / 3 ( Fig . 1B ) . VCA from N - WASP appeared to be slightly more potent than VCA from WASP and WASH in enhancing nucleation from SPIN90 - Arp2 / 3 ( with 2 µM G - actin and 1µM profilin , the estimated nucleation rate is 25 - 40 % higher ) . We wondered if the VCA domains from these three NPFs ranked similarly for the activation of Arp2 / 3 - induced branching . We thus compared the branch densities on pre - formed filaments , 90 seconds after exposing them for 90 seconds to Arp2 / 3 , G - actin , and VCA from the different NPFs ( see Methods ) . We observed the same ranking , with a more pronounced difference 4 between NPFs : the branch density was 0 . 95 , 0 . 43 and 0 . 27 branches / µm with VCA domains from N - WASP , WASP and WASH , respectively . VCA recruits G - actin as part of the branched nucleation process ( Chereau et al . , 2005 ) . With yeast homologs , it was found that the co - activation of Arp2 / 3 by VCA to form linear filaments required the recruitment of G - actin by VCA ( Balzer et al . , 2020 ) . We thus hypothesized that the availability of G - actin would impact the ability of VCA to enhance the nucleation of filaments from SPIN90 - Arp2 / 3 . To test this hypothesis , we took advantage of profilin , which competes with VCA for G - actin . We found that , in the presence of an excess of profilin , VCA from N - WASP no longer enhanced the nucleation of filaments from SPIN90 - Arp2 / 3 ( Fig . 1C ) . This observation confirms that VCA enhances SPIN90 - induced nucleation by recruiting actin monomers . Figure 1 . VCA domains accelerate the nucleation of filaments by SPIN90 - Arp2 / 3 . A . Schematic of the nucleation experiment . In a microfluidics chamber , SPIN90 - Arp2 / 3 is attached to the coverslip surface , via the His - tag on SPIN90 . Half of the chamber is then exposed to actin and profilin , while the other half is exposed to actin , profilin and VCA . Actin is labeled with Alexa488 ( 15 % ) , and one can monitor filaments as they nucleate and grow from the surface . Right : TIRF microscopy image of actin filaments . B . Normalized number of filaments nucleated over time , from SPIN90 - Arp2 / 3 exposed to 2 μΜ G - actin ( 15 % labeled with Alexa488 ) and 1 μΜ profilin , with 0 or 0 . 5µM of GST - VCA from different NPFs . Solid lines are exponential fits , yielding nucleation rates k nuc = ( 1 . 06±0 . 03 ) х10 - 3 s - 1 without VCA , and k nuc = ( 3 . 23±0 . 08 ) х10 - 3 , ( 2 . 58±0 . 05 ) х10 - 3 , and ( 2 . 28±0 . 03 ) х10 - 3 s - 1 with VCA from N - WASP , WASP and WASH , respectively . 5 C . Same as in ( B ) , with 3 µM G - actin and 3 . 5 µM profilin . The exponential fits yield k nuc = ( 1 . 2±0 . 02 ) х10 - 3 s - 1 without VCA , and k nuc = ( 1 . 3±0 . 02 ) х10 - 3 s - 1 with 0 . 5µM GST - VCA from N - WASP . In ( B , C ) , indicated values of n are the number of filaments observed in each individual experiment . These experiments were repeated three times , with similar results . VCA domains destabilize Arp2 / 3 at the pointed end of branches and linear filaments During the course of our experiments , we also noticed that the nucleated filaments detached faster from the surface in the presence of VCA ( Supp Fig S1 ) . This indicates that VCA destabilizes SPIN90 - Arp2 / 3 at pointed ends . To obtain further insights into this destabilization mechanism , we decided to quantify VCA - mediated detachment of SPIN90 - Arp2 / 3 - nucleated filaments , in the presence of 0 . 15 µM G - actin ( to maintain filaments at a constant length ) . Taking advantage of the sequential exposure provided by microfluidics , we elongated filaments from surface - anchored SPIN90 - Arp2 / 3 , and subsequently monitored their detachment , over time , as we exposed them to different concentrations of VCA domains ( Fig . 2A - C ) . We found that all VCA domains accelerated the detachment of filaments from the surface , in a dose - dependent manner , albeit to different extents . Interestingly , the NPFs did not rank the same as for the enhancement of nucleation : VCA from N - WASP was still the most effective ( increasing the detachment rate up to 16 - fold in the 0 - 1 µM range ) but WASP was much less effective than WASH . As dimerization enhances the branching activity of VCA domains ( Padrick et al . , 2008 ) we decided to compare the effectiveness of dimerized GST - and monomeric GFP - tagged VCA N - WASP . We found that dimerization had no impact on the ability of VCA to accelerate the nucleation of filaments by SPIN90 - Arp2 / 3 ( Supp Fig S2A ) . It did , however , enhance its ability to destabilize SPIN90 - Arp2 / 3 at the pointed end of the filaments : the apparent K D of GFP - VCA was 5 . 6 - fold higher than that of GST - VCA ( Supp Fig S2B - D ) . To determine if VCA domains could also destabilize Arp2 / 3 - mediated branches , we also performed similar experiments on branched filaments ( Fig . 2D - F ) . We found that all VCA domains accelerated debranching , in a dose - dependent manner . However , the NPFs did not rank the same as for the detachment of SPIN90 - Arp2 / 3 - nucleated filaments : VCA from WASP was still the least effective , but VCA from WASH was the most effective ( accelerating debranching up to 83 - fold in the 0 - 3 µM range ) . Intriguingly , this ranking also differed from the branching situation , where we found VCA from WASH to be the least effective . Since the recruitment of G - actin by VCA is necessary both for branching and for the enhancement of SPIN90 - induced nucleation ( Balzer et al . , 2020 ; Chereau et al . , 2005 ) ( Fig . 1C ) , we wondered how the availability of G - actin would affect the ability of VCA to induce debranching and / or destabilize SPIN90 - Arp2 / 3 at filament pointed ends . We thus repeated the experiments of figure 2 with different amounts of G - actin . We found that the ability of VCA to destabilize Arp2 / 3 , either at branch junctions or at the pointed end of linear filaments , was 6 reduced by the presence of G - actin ( Supp Fig S3 ) . These observations suggest that the ability of VCA to destabilize Arp2 / 3 - nucleated filaments relies on the availability of its V - domain . Figure 2 .

Error bars in ( C , F ) result from fits of the extremes of the 95 % confidence intervals of survival functions ( not shown in ( B , E ) for readability ) . The debranching factor GMF destabilizes SPIN90 - Arp2 / 3 - nucleated filaments Given our observations , we wondered whether branch destabilizers such as GMF also impact the stability of SPIN90 - Arp2 / 3 - nucleated filaments . To do so , we performed detachment experiments similar to the ones in Figure 2A , where we exposed the filaments to different concentrations of GMF . We found that GMF accelerated the detachment of filaments from the surface ( Fig 3 ) , with a higher affinity than VCA ( Fig 2A - C ) : K D = 25 + / - 130 nM for GMF , compared to 100 - 820 nM for the VCA domains from different NPFs . Figure 3 . GMF accelerates the detachment of SPIN90 - Arp2 / 3 - nucleated actin filaments . A .

Black lines are exponential fits . B . Detachment rates , determined by exponential fits of survival curves shown in A , as a function of the concentration of GMF . The error bars are determined by the exponential fits in A . The data are fitted by a Michaelis - Menten equation , yielding an apparent dissociation constant K D = 25±11 nM . 8 VCA and GMF generate free pointed ends as they dissociate the Arp2 / 3 complex from both SPIN90 and the filament So far , our readout of the destabilization of SPIN90 - Arp2 / 3 at the filament pointed end is the detachment of the filament from the surface . Since SPIN90 is strongly anchored to the surface via their His - tag ( see Methods ) , the detachment of the filament could result either from the rupture of the SPIN90 - Arp2 / 3 bond , or from the removal of the Arp2 / 3 complex from the filament pointed end . To determine whether the SPIN90 - Arp2 / 3 interaction is destabilized by GMF and VCA , we examined whether the Arp2 / 3 complex was still bound to SPIN90 after the detachment of the actin filament , in our microfluidics assay ( Fig . 4A - C ) . To do so , we quantified the fraction of functional SPIN90 locations that were able to renucleate a filament , following the departure of the initial actin filament , in different conditions . The new filaments took several tens of seconds to appear , consistent with renucleation , and ruling out regrowth from broken filaments which would be instantaneous . Based on the density of nucleated filaments in our experiments , it is very unlikely that renucleated filaments result from a different , co - localized SPIN90 . When only actin and profilin were flowed into the chamber , we observed that 36 % of surface - anchored SPIN90 were able to renucleate a filament , within the 500 seconds following the detachment of their first filament ( Fig . 4A - C ) . Based on our earlier experiments ( Fig . 1B ) , this number is the expected nucleation fraction after that time . This confirms that the population of anchored - SPIN90 from which filaments were first nucleated is still attached to the surface . This also indicates that , upon detachment of the filament , the Arp2 / 3 complex stays bound to SPIN90 . Consistent with this interpretation , supplying fresh Arp2 / 3 during the experiment did not increase the fraction of renucleated filaments ( Fig . 4B - C ) . In the presence of GMF , however , the renucleation fraction dropped to 15 % , and was rescued when fresh Arp2 / 3 was supplied ( Fig . 4B ) . This indicates that GMF destabilizes the SPIN90 - Arp2 / 3 bond in the presence of actin . We obtained similar results with the VCA domain of N - WASP ( from here onward , VCA refers to GST - NWASP - VCA ) indicating that VCA also destabilizes the SPIN90 - Arp2 / 3 bond in the presence of actin ( Fig . 4C ) . However , these experiments do not tell us if the separation of Arp2 / 3 from SPIN90 causes filament detachment , or if it occurred after . They also do not indicate whether Arp2 / 3 remains attached to the pointed end of the departing filament . To determine whether the Arp2 / 3 complex remained bound to the pointed ends of the filaments exposed to GMF or VCA , we performed experiments in open chambers ( no microfluidic flow ) where we could monitor the filaments’ ability to elongate from their pointed ends . To evaluate the fraction of capped pointed ends , we exposed preformed Alexa488 ( 15 % ) - actin filaments to barbed end capping proteins , and to Alexa568 ( 15 % ) - G - actin ( Fig . 4D ) . The vast majority of spontaneously nucleated filaments were able to elongate from their pointed ends , validating the rationale of the assay ( Fig . 4E - F ) . In contrast , most filaments nucleated by SPIN90 - Arp2 / 3 were unable to do so , indicating that their pointed ends were capped by SPIN90 - Arp2 / 3 . In the 9 presence of GMF or VCA , the fraction of elongating pointed ends increased significantly ( Fig . 4E - F ) . This demonstrates that the Arp2 / 3 complex was removed from the pointed end following , or during , the destabilization of SPIN90 - Arp2 / 3 by GMF or VCA . To determine if SPIN90 - Arp2 / 3 is also destabilized by GMF or VCA in the absence of a filament , we performed bead pull - down assays . We show that GMF and VCA both decrease the amount of Arp2 / 3 bound to SPIN90 - decorated beads ( Fig 4G ) . This observation indicates that , in the absence of actin , GMF and VCA interfere with the binding of Arp2 / 3 to SPIN90 . Figure 4 . GMF and VCA accelerate the detachment of Arp2 / 3 from both SPIN90 and filament pointed ends . A . Sketch of the renucleation assay , using microfluidics . The SPIN90 - Arp2 / 3 complex - decorated surface is exposed to 2 μΜ ( 15 % Alexa488 ) G - actin and 1 μΜ profilin , with 0 or 0 . 5 μΜ GMF , and with 0 or 5 nM Arp2 / 3 . Filaments nucleated by SPIN90 - Arp2 / 3 elongate ( 1 ) and , over time , detach from the surface ( 2 ) . Some of them renucleate , from the same location ( 3 ) . 10 B - C . The fraction of SPIN90 that renucleated a filament 500 seconds after the detachment of the initial filament , was quantified for different conditions The error bars represent the 95 % confidence intervals . P - values were calculated based on a chi - square test . D . Sketch and microscope image of the pointed end uncapping assay . Preformed filaments made with ( 15 % Alexa488 ) - actin were mixed with 10 nM Capping protein , 1 μΜ ( 15 % Alexa568 ) - G - actin , and 0 or 0 . 5 μΜ GMF ( or 0 . 5 µM VCA ) . In the microscope image ( left ) , filaments were nucleated by SPIN90 - Arp2 / 3 , and exposed to 0 . 5 µM GMF . Slow elongation of the filaments at one end ( white arrowheads ) indicates freely growing pointed ends . E - F . The fraction of elongating , i . e . not capped , pointed ends was determined for different conditions . The error bars represent the 95 % confidence intervals . P - values were calculated based on a chi - square test . The experiments in ( A - F ) were repeated twice , with similar results . G . GST pull - down assays showing that GMF and VCA interfere with Arp2 / 3 binding SPIN90 . GST beads , decorated with GST or GST - SPIN90 - Cter ( the functional domain of SPIN90 ) , were incubated with 0 . 4 μΜ Arp2 / 3 and gradient concentrations of GMF or VCA for 1 hour at room temperature . After the unbound protein was washed out , the amount of Arp2 / 3 attached to the beads was detected by Anti - 2C antibody . We verified that the beads were loaded with equal amounts of GST or GST - SPIN90 ( Supp Fig S4 ) . Piconewton forces promote debranching , but have no impact on SPIN90 - nucleated filaments It was recently shown that debranching is accelerated when ( sub ) piconewton forces are applied to the branch ( Pandit et al . , 2020 ) . We therefore wondered whether tensile forces also destabilize SPIN90 - Arp2 / 3 at the pointed end of filaments . By controlling the flow rate in our microfluidics assay , we can vary the force applied to actin filaments ( Jégou et al . , 2013 ) . Forces ranging from 0 . 2 to 2 pN accelerated debranching ( Fig . 5A ) . This observation remained true in the presence of VCA and GMF : pulling forces further accelerated debranching ( Fig 5 B - D ) . In contrast , we found that forces up to 2 pN had no impact on the detachment of SPIN90 - Arp2 / 3 - nucleated filaments , even in the presence of VCA or GMF ( Fig . 5E - H ) . To make sure that this result does not depend on our anchoring SPIN90 by its C - terminus ( see Methods ) , we also attached the protein by its N - terminus ( Supp Fig S5A ) . Again , we found that mechanical tension had no impact on filament detachment . We also verified that tension had no impact on detachment when exposing the filaments to GFP - VCA instead of GST - VCA ( Supp Fig S5A ) , or to a higher concentration ( 1 µM ) of GST - VCA ( Supp Fig S5B ) . 11 Figure 5 .

Summary of the detachment rates for SPIN90 - Arp2 / 3 - nucleated filaments , resulting from the exponential fits in ( E - G ) . Aging promotes debranching but has no impact on SPIN90 - nucleated filaments Debranching is enhanced as ATP is hydrolyzed in Arp2 and Arp3 , within the Arp2 / 3 complex at a branch junction , within minutes ( Le Clainche et al . , 2003 ; Pandit et al . , 2020 ) . Branches thus become less stable over time . Quantifying ATP hydrolysis in SPIN90 - activated Arp2 / 3 is particularly challenging , because of the large background of ATP hydrolysis taking place in F - actin , and because SPIN90 activates even lower amounts of Arp2 / 3 than the branching 12 reaction . Instead , to gain insights into this question , we sought to determine if time destabilizes SPIN90 - Arp2 / 3 at filament pointed ends , as seen with branch junctions . In our experiments up to now , we observed the detachment of branches and SPIN90 - nucleated filaments on average 5 minutes following their nucleation . Here , we aged filaments and branches for an additional delay while exposing them to minimal forces with a gentle flow , and subsequently monitored their detachment , on average 25 minutes after their nucleation . We confirmed that 25 - minute - old branches detach faster than 5 - minute - old branches , and found that this remains true when debranching is enhanced by VCA ( Fig . 6A ) . In contrast , we observed no significant difference between 5 - and 25 - minute - old SPIN90 - Arp2 / 3 - nucleated filaments , with or without VCA ( Fig . 6B ) . Figure 6 .

Shaded areas represent 95 % confidence intervals . The flowing solutions apply a weak force to the filaments ( < 1pN ) and branches ( 0 . 2 pN ) . 13 Cortactin stabilizes branches and SPIN90 - Arp2 / 3 at filament pointed ends Finally , we asked if cortactin , a protein proposed to interact with the Arp2 / 3 complex to stabilize branches ( Abella et al . , 2016 ; Weaver et al . , 2001 ) , could have a similar effect on SPIN90 - Arp2 / 3 - nucleated filaments . Since the stabilizing activity of cortactin was never observed directly on filament branches , we sought to confirm this property by carrying out debranching experiments as in Figure 2D . We observed that 30 - 100 nM cortactin indeed slows down debranching , by approximately 2 - fold ( Fig . 7A , Supp Fig . S6 ) . We next monitored the nucleation and the detachment of actin filaments from a SPIN90 - Arp2 / 3 - decorated surface , in the presence of cortactin . We found that cortactin very efficiently stabilizes SPIN90 - Arp2 / 3 at filament pointed ends ( Fig . 7B ) : 10 nM cortactin were enough to prevent all filament dissociation from the surface over the course of the experiment ( 1000 seconds ) . We then wondered what would be the outcome of SPIN90 - nucleated filaments in the presence of both cortactin and a destabilizer like VCA . We found that , in the presence of 0 . 5 µM VCA , the addition of 10 nM cortactin reduces the filament detachment rate by 3 orders of magnitude ( Fig . 7C ) . We also observed that cortactin accelerates the nucleation of filaments by SPIN90 - Arp2 / 3 , even in the presence of an excess of profilin ( Supp Fig S7 ) . The latter result is in contrast with VCA , whose enhancement of SPIN90 - induced nucleation requires G - actin ( Fig . 1 ) . This observation is consistent with the fact that cortactin does not bind G - actin . Figure 7 . Cortactin stabilizes Arp2 / 3 - mediated branches as well as SPIN90 - Arp2 / 3 at the pointed end of filaments . A . The fraction of remaining branches , versus time , exposed to 0 . 16 µM G - actin ( black ) supplemented with 50 nM cortactin ( red ) . The branch junctions were exposed to an average force of 1 . 4 pN . Similar results were obtained with different forces and different protein concentrations ( Supp Fig S6 ) . B . The fraction of remaining SPIN90 - Arp2 / 3 - nucleated filaments , versus time , exposed to 0 . 15 µM G - actin ( black ) supplemented with 10 nM cortactin ( red ) . 14 C .

Shaded areas represent 95 % confidence intervals . Discussion In cells , the Arp2 / 3 complex can be activated by VCA to generate branches , or by SPIN90 to generate linear filaments . Whether these two mechanisms can be regulated separately is an outstanding question . Here , we measured the impact of different regulatory factors on both mechanisms . We found that both systems were stabilized by cortactin , and destabilized by GMF as well as by the VCA domains of NPFs . While these regulatory proteins similarly affect branched and linear Arp2 / 3 - generated filaments , they do so with clear quantitative differences . For example , cortactin appears far more efficient at stabilizing SPIN90 - Arp2 / 3 at the pointed end than at stabilizing branches ( Fig . 7 ) . Likewise , SPIN90 - Arp2 / 3 at pointed ends is destabilized by lower concentrations of GMF , compared to branches ( Fig . 5 ) . Also , we found that VCA from different NPFs did not rank the same in their ability to destabilize SPIN90 - Arp2 / 3 and branches ( Fig . 2CF ) . These quantitative biochemical differences suggest that proteins in cells may differently regulate branched and linear Arp2 / 3 - generated filaments , thereby providing a means to control the two Arp2 / 3 machineries independently . Additional factors may further tune these regulatory activities . For instance , we found that aging and mechanical forces , which both strongly favor debranching , have little effect on the stability of SPIN90 - Arp2 / 3 at pointed ends ( Fig . 5 and 6 ) . This is an important feature in the cellular context , where actin networks containing both types of Arp2 / 3 - generated filaments , such as the cell cortex or during endocytosis , are exposed to mechanical stress . It indicates that mechanical stress can contribute to debranching , but that regulatory proteins are likely required to remove SPIN90 from the pointed ends . The differences we observe , where it appears that SPIN90 - Arp2 / 3 is globally more sensitive to regulatory proteins and less sensitive to aging and mechanical tension than branch junctions , can be linked to conformational differences between activated Arp2 / 3 in the two situations . The cryo - EM structures of the two forms of activated Arp2 / 3 exhibit small differences in contacts between subunits ArpC3 and Arp2 , and between ArpC5 / C5L and Arp2 ( Fäßler et al . , 2020 ; Shaaban et al . , 2020 ) . These differences are likely to affect interactions with GMF and VCA , which can both bind to Arp2 ( Luan and Nolen , 2013 ; Zimmet et al . , 2020 ) . Branch junctions become less stable as ATP in Arp2 and Arp3 is hydrolyzed , within minutes after a branch is formed ( Dayel and Mullins , 2004 ; Le Clainche et al . , 2003 ) . In contrast , ATP is still detected in Arp2 and Arp3 by cryo - EM , hours after activation by SPIN90 ( Shaaban et al . , 2020 ) . This suggests that SPIN90 - activated Arp2 / 3 does not hydrolyse ATP , or does so very slowly , and is consistent with our observation that SPIN90 - Arp2 / 3 does not seem to age ( Fig . 6 ) . The structural basis for the mechanical robustness of SPIN90 - Arp2 / 3 is less clear . SPIN90 binds 15 primarily to ArpC4 while , in a branch junction , the mother filament forms an extensive interface with several subunits of Arp2 / 3 ( Fäßler et al . , 2020 ; Luan et al . , 2018 ) . One could thus have expected Arp2 / 3 to detach more readily from SPIN90 than from the mother filament . Our results suggest that yet undetected conformational differences may be at play . Our observation that VCA enhances debranching ( Fig . 2 ) indicates that VCA can bind to Arp2 / 3 at the branch junction . This was unexpected because VCA detaches from Arp2 / 3 on the side of the mother filament during the branching reaction ( Smith et al . , 2013 ) . This result further suggests that VCA , beyond its role in the formation of branched filament networks , may also contribute to their reorganization by enhancing debranching . In cells , NPFs expose their VCA domains upon activation and binding to the membrane , meaning that branch junctions would need to contact the NPF - decorated membrane in order for debranching to be enhanced . This situation could be encountered during endocytosis , for example , where the branched filament network is densely packed against the membrane , and where debranching appears to be required to complete endocytic internalization ( Martin et al . , 2006 ) . A limitation , however , would come from the high concentration of cytoplasmic profilin - actin , which would bind to the polyproline domain of NPFs and ultimately load G - actin onto their V - domain ( Bieling et al . , 2018 ) . Unless G - actin is locally depeleted , this would likely inhibit , at least partially , the destabilizing activity of NPFs ( Supp Fig S3 ) . In cells , where the turnover of actin networks is tightly controlled , the state of filament pointed ends is of primary importance . Early EM observations of branched filaments detected the Arp2 / 3 complex also at the pointed end of linear filaments , suggesting that Arp2 / 3 could act as a pointed end capper ( Mullins et al . , 1998 ) . The persistence of SPIN90 with Arp2 / 3 at pointed ends makes this cap very stable , blocking filament depolymerization and renealling , and preventing SPIN90 from nucleating other filaments ( Balzer et al . , 2019 ) . We show that the destabilization of SPIN90 - Arp2 / 3 by GMF or VCA results in free pointed ends and renews the pool of free SPIN90 and Arp2 / 3 complexes ( Fig . 4 ) . In cells , we expect such mechanisms to contribute to controlling the state of pointed ends , and thus to controlling the stability and turnover of actin filament networks . Future studies should reveal if other inhibitors of branching , like Arpin or coronin , can play a similar role with SPIN90 - Arp2 / 3 at pointed ends . METHODS Biochemistry Protein preparation Skeletal muscle actin was purified from rabbit muscle acetone powder following the protocol from ( Spudich and Watt , 1971 ) , as described in ( Wioland et al . , 2017 ) . We have recombinantly expressed the following proteins in bacteria , with a N - ter GST tag : human N - WASP - VCA ( 392 - 505 , uniprot O00401 ) , WASP - VCA ( 418 - 502 , uniprot P42768 ) , mouse WASH - VCA ( 319 - 475 ) , human SPIN90 full - length ( 1 - 722 , uniprot Q9NZQ3 ) , SPIN90 Cter ( 267 - 722 ) , and mouse cortactin full length ( 1 - 546 Q60598 ) . Expression was performed in E . Coli Rosetta 2 ( DE3 ) for 16h at 18 °C . GST - tagged 16 proteins were purified by affinity chromatography over a Sepharose 4B GSH affinity column ( Cytiva ) in GST - buffer ( 20 mM Tris pH 7 . 5 , 500 mM NaCl , 1 mM DTT ) . The GST protein was eluted with the same buffer supplemented with 50 mM GST . The purification is followed by gel filtration over a Hiload Superdex 200 column ( Cytiva ) in GF - buffer ( 20 mM Tris pH 7 . 5 , 50 mM KCl , 1 mM DTT , 5 % Glycerol ) . Before the gel filtration step , the GST - tag of GFP - N - WASP - VCA and cortactin was cut by PreScission Protease ( Sigma - Aldrich ) overnight at 4°C , to obtain monomeric N - WASP - VCA and untagged full length cortactin . C - terminal His - tagged versions of recombinant human SPIN90 full - length ( 1 - 722 ) and drosophila GMF ( 1 - 138 , uniprot Q9VJL6 ) were purified by affinity chromatography over a HisTrap HP column ( Cytiva ) in His - buffer ( 20 mM Tris pH 7 . 5 , 500 mM NaCl , 1 mM DTT , 20 mM Imidazole ) and eluted in the same buffer supplemented with 300 mM Imidazole . The purification was polished by gel filtration over a Hiload Superdex 200 column ( Cytiva ) in 20 mM Tris pH 7 . 5 , 500 mM NaCl , 1 mM DTT . Recombinant human profilin1 was expressed and purified , as described in ( Cao et al . , 2018 ) . Arp2 / 3 was purified from bovine brain , as previously described ( Le Clainche and Carlier , 2004 ) . Protein labelling Actin was fluorescently labeled on the surface lysine 328 , using Alexa - 488 or Alexa - 594 succinimidyl ester ( Life Technologies ) as described in detail in ( Romet - Lemonne et al . , 2018 ) . To minimize potential artifacts caused by the presence of the fluorophores , we typically used an actin labeling fraction of 15 % . Microscopy Buffers All microfluidics experiments were performed in F - buffer : 5 mM Tris HCl pH 7 . 0 , 50 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM EGTA , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 10 mM DTT , 1 mM DABCO and 0 . 1 % BSA . Open chambers experiments ( figure 4D - F ) were performed using the same buffer supplemented with 0 . 3 % methylcellulose 4000 cP . Single filament assays in microfluidics Microfluidics experiments were done with Poly - Dimethyl - Siloxane ( PDMS , Sylgard ) chambers based on the original protocol from ( Jégou et al . , 2011 ) . The chambers have cross - shaped channels with three inlets and one outlet . A MFCS system and Flow Units ( Fluigent ) were used to control and monitor the microfluidic flows . PDMS chambers were cleaned and mounted by following the protocol described in ( Cao et al . , 2018 ) . The experiments were performed on a Nikon TiE inverted microscope , equipped with a 60x oil - immersion objective , in F - buffer . The temperature was controlled and set to 25°C ( using an objective heater from Oko - lab ) , except for the experiments with GMF where the temperature was a few degrees above 25°C . Actin filaments were visualized using TIRF microscopy ( iLAS2 , Gataca Systems ) with 150 mW tunable lasers . Images were acquired using an Evolve EMCCD camera ( Photometrics ) , controlled with the Metamorph software ( version 7 . 10 . 4 , from Molecular Devices ) . SPIN90 - Arp2 / 3 assays Full length GST - SPIN90 or SPIN90 - His were specifically anchored to the coverslip surface of a microfluidics chamber using specific antibodies adsorbed to the surface , prior to passivation by exposing the chamber to a 3 % BSA solution for at least 5 minutes , as described in ( Cao et al . , 2020 ) . The chamber was subsequently exposed to 30nM Arp2 / 3 complex for 5 minutes and rinsed with F - buffer . - SPIN90 - Arp2 / 3 filament nucleation The nucleation rate is measured by exposing surface - anchored His - tagged SPIN90 - Arp2 / 3 to 2 μM 15 % Alexa - 488 actin and 1 μM profilin , with or without 0 . 5 μM of the different VCA domains ( figure 1 ) , or in the presence or absence of 50 nM cortactin ( Supp Fig S7 ) . 17 - Dissociation of SPIN90 - Arp2 / 3 - nucleated filaments Surface - anchored SPIN90 - Arp2 / 3 was exposed to 0 . 7 μM 15 % Alexa - 488 actin for 5 minutes to nucleate and elongate actin filaments , in the presence of varying concentrations of the different VCA domains ( figure 2A - C ) . The survival fractions of SPIN90 - Arp2 / 3 - nucleated filaments over time were fitted with a single exponential function that yields the dissociation rates of filament from SPIN90 - Arp2 / 3 for each condition . The dissociation rates were plotted versus the concentration of VCA , and a fit using the Michaelis - Menten equation was used to obtain the affinity constant and maximum dissociation rate . The dissociation rate of SPIN90 - Arp2 / 3 nucleated actin in the presence of cortactin was measured following the same procedure ( Fig 7 ) . The dissociation rate of SPIN90 - Arp2 / 3 nucleated actin in the presence of GMF was measured following the same procedure but using the full - length GST - SPIN90 construct ( Fig 3 ) . To measure the impact of time on the dissociation rate , generated actin filaments were incubated with 0 . 15 μM G - actin for an extra duration of 20 minutes , before being exposed to buffer only or 0 . 5 µM of N - WASP - VCA ( Fig 6 ) . - Impact of mechanical tension on the detachment of SPIN90 - Arp2 / 3 - nucleated filaments . With the same experimental procedure described in the previous paragraph , various pulling forces can be applied to the filaments by varying the flow rate and filament length ( Jégou et al . , 2013 ) ( Fig 5 ) . - Detachment of Arp2 / 3 from both SPIN90 and the filament pointed end ( Figure 4 ) . To assess the ability of GMF to separate Arp2 / 3 from SPIN90 , surface - anchored GST - SPIN90 - Arp2 / 3 - nucleated filaments were exposed to 2 μM 15 % Alexa - 488 labeled G - actin , 1 μM profilin , with and without 0 . 5 μM GMF , and with or without 5 nM Arp2 / 3 ( figure 4B ) . The renucleation fraction of a randomly picked population of SPIN90 - Arp2 / 3 - nucleated filaments was assessed after 500 seconds . To assess the ability of GST - N - WASP - VCA to separate Arp2 / 3 from SPIN90 , surface - anchored SPIN90 - His - Arp2 / 3 - nucleated filaments were alternatively exposed to 0 . 5 μM GST - N - WASP - VCA or buffer for 30 seconds , then to a nucleation solution containing 2 μM 15 % Alexa - 488 labeled actin and 1 μM profilin , with or without 5 nM Arp2 / 3 for 90 seconds . In this assay , VCA and Arp2 / 3 were not mixed together with actin to avoid unnecessary generation of branched actin in solution and on the surface - anchored filaments . The renucleation fraction of a randomly picked population of SPIN90 - Arp2 / 3 - nucleated filaments was assessed after 500 seconds . ( Fig 4C ) . - Single filaments in open chambers ( Figure 4D - F ) Experiments aimed at observing pointed end elongation were not performed using microfluidics , but using so - called ‘open chambers’ , i . e . mPEG - silane - passivated flow chambers made following the protocol described in ( Cao et al . , 2020 ) . 50 nM Arp2 / 3 , 1 μM SPIN90 Cter , 0 . 5 μM 15 % Alexa - 488 actin were mixed together for 3 minutes to generate SPIN90 - Arp2 / 3 nucleated actin filaments . As a positive control , 1 μM 15 % Alexa - 488 actin were mixed together for 3 minutes to generate spontaneously nucleated actin filaments . 4 μL of SPIN90 - Arp2 / 3 nucleated filaments or 2 μL of spontaneously nucleated actin filaments were mixed with 10 nM Capping protein , 1 μΜ 15 % Alexa - 568 actin with or without 0 . 5 μΜ GMF and flowed into the chamber immediately , using an F - buffer supplemented with 0 . 3 % methylcellulose 4000 cP . The fraction of actin filaments with an elongating pointed end is quantified at time t = 350 seconds after solution mixing . To study the uncapping effect of VCA , the same experiment was done except that we used 5 nM Arp2 / 3 , 2 μM SPIN90 Cter , 0 . 5 μM 15 % Alexa - 488 actin to generate SPIN90 - Arp2 / 3 nucleated actin filaments to minimize the amount of Arp2 / 3 in the system . 18 Arp2 / 3 - mediated branches assays - Dissociation of branches by VCA domains , cortactin , and forces The coverslip surface of a microfluidics chamber was functionalized by exposing it to 2 . 5 pM spectrin - actin seeds for 5 minutes , followed by a passivation with a solution containing 3 % BSA for 5 minutes . Mother filaments were grown from seeds by exposing them to 0 . 7 μM 15 % Alexa - 488 actin . Mother filaments were then exposed to 0 . 15 μM unlabelled actin for 1 minute . To generate the branches , the mother filaments are sequentially exposed to a solution of 30 nM Arp2 / 3 and 0 . 25 μM VCA for exactly 2 minutes , followed by a solution of 0 . 5 μM 15 % Alexa - 568 actin for 5 minutes in order to obtain branches in a different color than the one of the mother filaments . Arp2 / 3 - generated branches were exposed to 0 . 15 μM 15 % Alexa - 488 actin in the presence or absence of varying concentrations of the different VCA domains ( Fig 2D - F ) or 50 nM cortactin ( Fig 7A ) . The survival fractions of branches over time were fitted with a single exponential function that yields the dissociation rates of branches for each condition . The dissociation rates were plotted versus the concentration of VCA , and a fit using the Michaelis - Menten equation was used to obtain the affinity constant and maximum dissociation rate . Various pulling forces can be applied to actin branches as described in ( Pandit et al . , 2020 ) . The dissociation of actin branches is measured under a range of pulling forces , in the presence or absence of 1 µM VCA or 1 µM GMF ( Fig 5A - D ) . Likewise , the dissociation rate of aged actin branches is performed by exposing branches to 0 . 15 μM G - actin for 20 minutes prior to monitor their dissociation ( Fig 6 ) . - Branching efficiency of different NPFs ( VCA domain of NWASP WASP , and WASH ) . The coverslip surface of a microfluidics chamber was functionalized by exposing it to 4 pM spectrin - actin seeds for 5 minutes , followed by a passivation with a solution containing 5 % BSA for 5 minutes . Mother filaments were polymerized by flowing 0 . 7 μM 10 % Alexa - 488 actin . Then for 90 seconds , we exposed the mother filaments to a solution of 20nM Arp2 / 3 , 50nM VCA , and 0 . 4 μM 10 % Alexa - 568 actin to generate branches . We next flowed in a solution of 0 . 5 μM 10 % Alexa - 568 actin for 90 seconds to further grow the branches . After that time , branch densities were determined by counting the number of branches on mother filaments , and measuring the length of mother filaments . GST pull - down assays Prior to each pull - down assay , the Glutathione Sepharose 4B resin ( GE Healthcare ) was incubated with 5 % BSA for 5 minutes and washed 3 times with 500 μL GST pull - down buffer containing 50 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 0 , 1 mM DTT , 50 mM KCl , and 5 % glycerol . 100 μL of 2 μM Glutathione Sepharose 4B attached GST SPIN90 full length was mixed with 250 nM Arp2 / 3 . A concentration gradient ( 0 , 0 . 5 , 2 , 4 μM ) of GMF or GFP - VCA was mixed with the loaded resin and allow to incubate for 1 hour at 4°C . The resin were then washed 3 times with 300 μL of GST pull - down buffer . Resin - attached proteins were eluted with 50 μL of 20 mM GSH . The sample was separated by SDS - PAGE for western blot analysis . Anti - ArpC2 ( Sigma ) was used to detect Arp2 / 3 . The negative control experiment was done in the same way except 50 μL of 2 μM Glutathione Sepharose TM 4B attached GST was mixed with 250 nM Arp2 / 3 , with or without 4 μM GMF or GFP - VCA for 1 hour at 4°C . 19 Data analysis Fiji software ( Schindelin et al . , 2012 ) was used to analyze images manually . Survival fraction analysis We used the Kaplan - Meier method ( ‘survival’ package in R ) to estimate and plot the survival fractions of the different populations probed in microfluidics assays . Data was fitted with a single exponential decay function to obtain the experimental detaching or debranching rates . In nucleation experiments ( Fig . 1 ) , the total number of nucleation sites in the field of view ( plateau ) was determined by the exponential fit of the curve , and used to normalize the number of nucleated filaments . VCA and GMF protein affinity for SPIN90 - Arp2 / 3 or Arp2 / 3 branches The binding affinity curves in figures 2 & 3 were derived using the Michaelis - Menten equation : k _ obs ( x ) = k _ max . x / ( K D + x ) , where x is the protein concentration in solution , k _ max is the maximum apparent rate of the reaction and K D the dissociation constant of the pseudo first - order reaction . Statistical significance To compare the survival distributions of two samples . , p - value from the log - rank test , using the ‘survival’ package in R . In figure 4 , to assess the significance of the statistical difference between fractions of SPIN90 - Arp2 / 3 complexes that renucleated a filament in different conditions ( figure 4 B & C ) , or the fraction of elongating pointed ends after their detachment from SPIN90 - Arp2 / 3 ( figure 4 E & F ) , p - values were calculated based on a chi - square test using R .
