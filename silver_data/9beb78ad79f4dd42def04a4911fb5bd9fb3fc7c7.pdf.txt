We found CD61 to be highly expressed in aged HSCs . Here we investigate the role of CD61 in identifying distinct subpopulations of aged HSCs and assess how expression of CD61 affects stem cell function . We show that HSCs with high expression of CD61 are functionality superior and retain self - renewal capacity in serial transplantations . A population of aged HSCs with highest CD61 expression is functionally comparable to young HSCs . These CD61 High HSCs display a notably higher quiescence compared to their CD61 Low counterparts . We also show that CD61 High and CD61 Low HSCs are transcriptomically distinct populations within aged HSCs . Collectively , our research identifies CD61 as a key player in maintaining stem cell quiescence during aging , ensuring the preservation of their functional integrity and potential . Moreover , CD61 emerges as a marker to prospectively isolate a superior , highly dormant population of young and aged HSCs , making it a valuable tool both in fundamental and clinical research . Highlights • CD61 expression marks a functionally superior population of long - term hematopoietic stem cells and plays a pivotal role in the maintenance of aged LT - HSCs by regulating their dormancy • Aged LT - HSCs with high expression of CD61 are functionally comparable to their young counterparts 3 Introduction Hematopoietic stem cells ( HSCs ) reside at the top of the hematopoietic hierarchy and are defined by their unique regenerative potential and ability to give rise to all the blood lineages throughout the lifetime of an organism . Nevertheless , normal aging has been shown to lead to a gradual functional decline of the hematopoietic stem cells 1 – 3 . Upon aging , murine HSCs lose their overall self - renewal and regenerative potential , skew towards the myeloid lineage and expand in numbers 4 – 7 . Long - term transplantation assays show that aged HSCs , when transplanted into a young bone marrow ( BM ) microenvironment , display a reduced functional activity , hence the age - related decrease in HSC activity seems to be mainly intrinsically - driven 8 . Numerous cell - intrinsic defects have been suggested to contribute to the decreased overall potential of aged HSCs , such as the loss of polarity 9 , 10 , impaired autophagy 11 , 12 , DNA damage accumulation 13 , 14 and epigenetic modifications 15 , 16 . However , it has also been shown that an altered BM microenvironment affects the functional activity of aged of HSCs . For example , aged HSCs transplanted into young recipients exhibited reduced myeloid - skewing compared to those transplanted into old recipients 17 . In addition , BM niche remodeling and localization of HSCs in their niche affect the aging process 18 , 19 . HSC aging is thus a very heterogenous process influenced and regulated by numerous intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms , where not every individual HSC is equally susceptible to or affected by the aging process 20 – 22 . Interestingly , some individual aged HSCs have been shown to function as if they have not aged at all 4 , 6 . Recently we published a meta - analysis of 16 independent studies in which the transcriptomes of young and aged murine HSCs had been assessed . From these studies we were able to derive an HSC Aging Signature – a robust list of genes that are differentially expressed upon murine HSC aging 23 . This signature , consisting of ~ 200 genes , included an abundance of novel genes previously not associated with aging , nor with HSCs . Unexpectedly , almost 50 % of the genes in the Aging Signature encode for membrane - associated genes , which suggests that communication between HSCs and the bone marrow environment is altered during aging . Itgb3 , a membrane - associated gene that encodes for CD61 – a widely expressed β - integrin from the integrin family 24 , 25 , was upregulated in 9 out 12 studies used to establish the Aging Signature . CD61 acts in heterodimers with the α - integrins CD41 and CD51 , and is known to regulate cell adhesion , cell signaling and differentiation 26 – 28 . Notably , it is the only member of the integrin family to be present in the Aging Signature . The role of CD61 in regulating HSCs has been studied previously and CD61 has been reported to affect several HSC - niche communication pathways , including thrombopoietin - mediated HSC regulation 29 , cell 4 adhesion and inflammation response via interferon γ signaling 30 . High expression of CD61 has also been shown to be correlated with a more quiescent subpopulation of HSCs in young mice 31 . Notwithstanding these effects , it has also been shown that downregulation or deletion of CD61 in HSCs had little to no effect on the overall functionality of HSCs 29 , 32 . CD61 has never been studied in the context of HSC aging . As we found CD61 to be one of the most robustly upregulated genes in aged HSCs , we aimed to assess whether altered expression of CD61 on aged HSCs affects stem cell functioning . Our study shows that CD61 expression identifies a functionally superior population of LT - HSCs in both young but particularly aged bone marrow and may be used to prospectively isolate these cells .

Results During aging expression of CD61 is specifically increased in the most primitive hematopoietic stem cells Recently , we published a transcriptome meta - analysis which revealed that Itgb3 – the gene encoding for CD61 - is the only consistently reported integrin family member that is differentially expressed upon murine hematopoietic stem cell aging ( Fig 1A ) . Using qRT - PCR we analyzed various subpopulations within the progenitor cell compartment ( Lin - , Sca1 + , c - Kit + ) and found that Itgb3 is exclusively upregulated in the most primitive LT - HSCs ( Lin - , Sca1 + , c - Kit + , CD150 + , CD48 - ) ( Fig . 1B ) . With FACS we confirmed that increased Itgb3 mRNA expression in aged LT - HSCs correlates with increased protein levels ( Fig . 1C - D ) . 7 Furthermore , to assess how expression of CD61 changes during the aging trajectory , we analyzed its expression at different ages . This revealed that CD61 expression increases gradually throughout the lifetime of a mouse ( Fig . 1C - D ) . Aged CD61 High and CD61 low express distinct transcriptomes To better understand the role of CD61 upregulation in LT - HSCs upon aging , we performed RNA sequencing on highly purified aged LT - HSCs separated by CD61 expression . To this end we isolated the 10 % highest ( CD61 High ) and lowest ( CD61 Low ) CD61 expressing LT - HSCs ( Fig . 2A and B ) . Even though Lin - Sca1 + c - Kit + CD150 + CD48 - are highly purified , we found that within this population CD61 High and CD61 Low expressing cells differed significantly in their transcriptomic landscape ( Fig . 2C ) . We identified 278 genes that were significantly differentially expressed between CD61 High and CD61 Low LT - HSCs , with 148 upregulated and 130 downregulated genes in CD61 High LT - HSCs ( Fig . 2D ) . To compare CD61 High and CD61 Low LT - HSC transcriptome signatures , we performed gene set enrichment analysis ( GSEA ) for previously published LT - HSC gene signatures ( Rodriguez - Fraticelli , 2020 ; Cabezas - Wallscheid , 2017 ) . Interestingly , CD61 High LT - HSCs showed enrichment for a dormant HSC signature , as well as low - output HSC signature ( Fig 2E - F ) . Both low - output and dormant HSCs are stem cell populations associated with superior reconstitution and self - renewal potential 33 , 34 . Additionally , GSEA analysis showed enrichment of cell cycle - related pathways in CD61 Low LT - HSCs , suggesting that these cells are actively cycling , compared to CD61 High LT - HSCs ( Fig . 2G ) . Together , these data show that aged CD61 High LT - HSCs are molecularly distinct from CD61 Low LT - HSCs and exhibit a signature that is associated with superior stem cell functionality . High expression of CD61 in aged LT - HSCs is associated with quiescence The RNA sequencing data revealed that aged LT - HSCs with differential CD61 expression are molecularly distinct ( Fig . 2C - D ) . We next tested whether these molecular differences would translate into functional consequences . We first analyzed the proliferation potential of CD61 Low and CD61 High LT - HSCs , isolated from young or aged donor mice , by sorting single LT - HSCs in a well and culturing these for 14 days . We analyzed the size of the colony that they were able to produce . After 14 days young CD61 High and CD61 Low LT - HSCs proliferated equally ( Fig . 3B ) . However , when isolated from aged mice , CD61 Low LT - HSCs proliferated significantly worse , with a large fraction of cells not proliferating at all ( Fig . 3C ) . Aged CD61 High LT - HSCs proliferated similarly to cells isolated from young mice , confirming their “young - like” phenotype . As the transcriptome data suggested that CD61 High and CD61 Low LT - HSCs may differ in their cell cycle activity , we performed cell cycle analysis using Ki67 and DNA staining . This 8 experiment showed that young CD61 High and CD61 Low LT - HSCs had a comparable distribution of cells in distinct cell cycle phases ( Fig . 3D ) . In contrast , in aged LT - HSCs essentially all CD61 High LT - HSCs were in G 0 , whereas CD61 Low cells were more abundant in G1 and G2 - S - M phases ( Fig . 3E ) . Next , we analyzed the division rate of young and aged CD61 High and CD61 Low LT - HSCs , by sorting single - cell into a well and after 48h counting the fraction of wells in which a cell division had occurred , i . e . , in which more than one cell was present . For both young and aged we found a lower division rate of CD61 High LT - HSCs ( Fig . 3F ) . These functional data corroborate the molecular data and show that CD61 High LT - HSCs are more quiescent . LT - HSCs with low expression of CD61 accumulate significantly more DNA damage Hypothesizing that the higher proliferation rate of aged CD61 Low LT - HSCs may result in increased DNA damage accumulation and subsequent cell death , we analyzed levels of DNA damage in aged stem cells . We stained freshly isolated aged CD61 High and CD61 Low LT - HSCs with an anti - γ H2AX antibody , which detects double - strand breaks ( DSB ) within cells . Using confocal microscopy , we imaged cells and counted the number of γ H2AX foci . Figure 3G shows a representative comparison between aged CD61 High and CD61 Low cells . The analysis revealed that CD61 Low LT - HSCs exhibited a significantly higher number of foci per cell compared to CD61 High cells ( Fig . 3H ) . This confirms that aged LT - HSCs with low CD61 expression accumulate more DNA damage , likely due to their higher division rate and proliferative potential . Consequently , increased DNA damage may trigger apoptosis , providing a possible explanation for their lower output in in vitro single - cell proliferation assays . CD61 - CD51 dimerization drives CD61 - mediated maintenance of aged LT - HSCs quiescence Integrins dimerize into distinct hetero - and homodimers to facilitate biological processes . CD61 can heterodimerize with CD51 ( Itgav ) or CD41 ( Itga2b ) 35 . To further understand the mechanism of CD61 - mediated LT - HSCs quiescence we explored which CD61 heterodimer is involved in this process . We first determined whether either CD51 or CD41 is co - expressed with CD61 in aged LT - HSCs . As shown in Figure 4B , CD51 , but not CD41 , expression levels correlated with CD61 expression . This suggests that CD61 - CD51 dimerization may occur in aged LT - HSCs . We then cultured aged LT - HSCs in the presence of dimer - specific small - molecule inhibitors – Tirofiban for CD61 - CD41 and cycloRGD γ K for CD61 - CD51 ( Fig 4B ) . Both inhibitors have been reported to selectively inhibit the activity of their target dimer 36 , 37 . We analyzed whether these inhibitors affected proliferation kinetics of aged CD61 High and CD61 Low LT - HSCs . As expected , Tirofiban had a minimal effect , whereas cycloRGD γ K supplementation induced 9 increased cycling in LT - HSCs in serum - containing cultures ( Fig . 4C ) . Interestingly , this effect was restricted to ( quiescent ) CD61 High stem cells , increasing their division rate comparable to those of CD61 Low LT - HSCs . The release of quiescence was not detectable in unfractionated LT - HSCs , which suggests that CD61 - CD51 heterodimerization occurs specifically in LT - HSCs with highest CD61 expression ( Supplementary Fig . S4A ) . Cell cycle analysis confirmed that CD61 High LT - HSCs treated with cycloRGD γ K had a higher percentage of cells in G2 - S - M phases in comparison to DMSO control . In addition , we found a higher number of cells in cycloRGD γ K - treated cultures ( Supplementary Fig . S4C ) . CD61 expression marks a subpopulation of functionally superior aged LT - HSCs . The transcriptomic data as well as in vitro experiments indicated that CD61 expression marks distinct populations of LT - HSCs . We next asked whether these differences would also translate in functional differences in in vivo assays . To this end we employed competitive transplantation assays using freshly isolated CD61 High and CD61 Low LT - HSCs ( CD45 . 2 + ) . We transplanted 500 CD61 High and 500 CD61 Low LT - HSCs , along with 2x10 6 whole bone marrow cells ( WBM ) obtained from W 41 mice ( C57BL / 6J - KitW - 41J / J ) , into lethally irradiated recipient mice ( CD45 . 1 + ) . Chimerism levels in the peripheral blood ( PB ) of recipient mice were analyzed every 4 weeks for at least 16 weeks using flow cytometry . After 16 weeks recipient mice were sacrificed and their bone marrow analyzed . Next , 500 LT - HSCs harvested from primary recipients were serially competitively transplanted into secondary recipients and chimerism levels were analyzed for another 16 weeks . After the second 16 - week period bones were harvested and analyzed . We first competitively transplanted CD61 High and CD61 Low LT - HSCs isolated from young mice . In young LT - HSCs , differential expression of CD61 did not affect the reconstituting potential in primary transplantations ( Fig 5B , 5D ) . CD61 High and CD61 Low LT - HSCs isolated from young mice possessed comparable lineage contribution to the myeloid , T - cell and B - cell peripheral blood cell compartments ( Supplementary Fig . S5J ) . However , when we performed these experiments using aged mice as donors , we observed significant differences in chimerism levels between mice transplanted with CD61 High or CD61 Low LT - HSCs as early as 4 weeks post - transplantation ( Fig 5C - D ) . Aged CD61 Low LT - HSCs produced significantly less peripheral blood cells compared to CD61 High LT - HSCs . Chimerism levels in mice transplanted with aged CD61 Low LT - HSCs remained below 25 % whereas contribution derived from aged CD61 High cells gradually increased , and were comparable to young HSCs ( 5B , C ) . The lineage contribution to different PB cell populations was similar between CD61 High and CD61 Low LT - HSCs ( Supplementary Fig . S5M ) . 10 After 16 weeks the BM of primary recipient mice was analyzed and although no significant differences were found in the bone marrow of recipient mice transplanted with young CD61 High or CD61 Low LT - HSCs , we discovered an average 8 - fold increase in the frequency of the donor - derived aged CD61 Low LT - HSCs ( Fig . 5E ) . As HSCs highly rely on their self - renewal / differentiation ratio and its balance to maintain their activity throughout the lifetime of the organism , we hypothesized that the reason for this increase is a higher proliferation rate of cells with a decreased CD61 expression . We performed secondary transplantations to determine self - renewal potential of LT - HSCs . Whereas young CD61 Low LT - HSCs engrafted perfectly fine in primary recipients , upon secondary transplantation young CD61 Low LT - HSCs exhibited a significant decline in their repopulation capacity ( Fig . 5F , 5H ) . Secondary transplantation of aged LT - HSCs revealed that CD61 High LT - HSCs retain some self - renewal capacity , whereas aged CD61 Low LT - HSCs showed a complete failure in reconstituting the hematopoietic system ( Fig . 5G - H ) . Even though secondary transplantation of young and aged CD61 High and CD61 Low LT - HSCs showed differential reconstitution capacity , the contribution to distinct peripheral blood cell populations remained evenly distributed , both in primary and secondary transplantation ( Supplementary Fig . S5J - S5U ) . As expression of CD150 has been associated with functional activity of HSCs 38 , we assessed whether CD61 expression correlates with expression of CD150 . We found no correlation between expression levels of CD61 and CD150 ( Supplementary Figure S5V ) . Thus , differential CD61 expression identifies functionally distinct LT - HSCs populations , independently from CD150 expression . Collectively , our data show that CD61 marks a functionally superior stem cell population , both in young and aged mice . In aged mice , CD61 marks a population of LT - HSCs that is functionally comparable to young LT - HSCs . Repression of CD61 in aged and young LT - HSCs leads to impairment of reconstitution potential To further assess the role of CD61 we asked whether enforced perturbation of CD61 expression would affect HSC functioning . We repressed CD61 in young and aged LT - HSCs using short - hairpin RNA ( shRNAs ) , with a scrambled shRNA ( SCR ) as a negative control ( Fig . 6A ) . We isolated LT - HSCs and infected cells ex vivo with a lentiviral pLKO . 1 shRNA - mCherry construct . After 5 days of culturing in expansion medium , we transplanted mCherry + cells into lethally irradiated recipients alongside 2x10 6 WBM W 41 competitor cells . Downregulation of CD61 was confirmed both on transcriptome and protein level ( Fig . 6B - C ) . Our data revealed that repression of CD61 expression in aged LT - HSCs is detrimental for their reconstitution potential ( Fig . 6D , 6E ) . In contrast to the control that gradually increased 11 their overall contribution to blood production , engraftment of CD61 KD LT - HSCs remained stable throughout the whole duration of the experiment . Although the reconstitution potential of CD61 KD was limited , the overall ratio of blood cells produced ( B , T and myeloid cells ) was comparable to that of the SCR control , with a trend toward higher myeloid cells output ( Fig . 6F ) . After 16 weeks the BM of the recipient mice was analyzed . Interestingly , we found a 2 - fold increase in the percentage of donor - derived LT - HSCs in CD61 KD group , in comparison to the SCR ( Fig . 6G ) . The observed results align closely with the findings from recipient mice transplanted with aged CD61 Low LT - HSCs ( Fig . 5C , 5E ) . Finally , we assessed whether perturbing CD61 expression levels in young LT - HSCs affected functioning as well . Unexpectedly downregulation of CD61 in young LT - HSCs almost completely diminishes their ability to replenish the hematopoietic system in a competitive transplantation experiment ( Fig . 6H ) . Collectively , we show that repression of CD61 expression is detrimental to the engraftment of young and aged LT - HSCs . Discussion In this study we show that differential expression of CD61 identifies transcriptomically and functionally distinct populations of aged LT - HSCs . Notably , we found that LT - HSCs exhibiting high levels of CD61 expression are more quiescent and exhibit superior functional properties compared to LT - HSCs with low CD61 expression . Our findings demonstrate that CD61 is not only a marker that can be used to identify a superior LT - HSC population , but CD61 is also essential for the proper functioning of both young and aged hematopoietic stem cells . Additionally , we provide evidence that aged LT - HSCs expressing high levels of CD61 exhibit a phenotype similar to " young - like " LT - HSCs , suggesting that HSCs displaying increased CD61 expression demonstrate enhanced resilience to the aging process . The role of CD61 has not been well studied in the context of hematopoietic stem cell aging , although we have recently shown that it is one of the most robustly upregulated genes during aging 23 . It has been shown that young CD61 High HSCs display enhanced quiescence and higher repopulation capacity 31 and our data confirm this . CD61 deficient mice are mostly embryonically lethal , but the few mice that do survive exhibit a phenotype similar to our young CD61 Low HSCs . Young CD61 deficient HSCs did not show distinct phenotypic changes in primary transplantation , but lost their self - renewal ability and failed in secondary transplantation , reinforcing the essential role of CD61 expression in HSC self - renewal , possibly by preserving dormancy 29 . It has been reported that while CD61 is dispensable for hematopoiesis , it is required for leukemogenesis 32 . CD61 expression has been associated with myeloid skewing in aged HSCs 39 , but in our functional experiments we did not observe any myeloid skewing as a result of perturbing 12 CD61 expression . However , we did find a myeloid signature in CD61 High LT - HSCs , confirming that , at least on transcriptomic level , CD61 High cells might have a myeloid bias 39 . It remains unknown why CD61 is upregulated in the aged LT - HSC compartment . We observed increased expression of CD61 preferentially in the most primitive compartments , as well as an increase in the population of CD61 High LT - HSCs . Elevated expression of CD61 in primitive LT - HSCs might be caused by age - associated epigenetic alterations , that are known to occur in aged stem cells 15 , 16 , 40 . In parallel investigations , we therefore explored whether the epigenetic status of the Itgb3 locus is altered in aged LT - HSCs . However , we have not been able to discern any significant modifications in overall chromatin accessibility , H3K4me3 , H3K27me3 , H3K36me3 , nor DNA methylation patterns between young and aged LT - HSCs ( data not shown ) . We hypothesize that the age - dependent increase in the population of CD61 High LT - HSCs may be the result of a selection process . During aging , dormant CD61 High LT - HSCs may preferentially be retained within the aged bone marrow environment , possibly as a result of the many dynamic changes of bone marrow remodeling that occur during aging . Age - associated bone marrow microenvironmental changes involve both cellular as well as non - cellular constituents . One such change is the downregulation of CD61 ligand – Osteopontin , in the aged bone marrow 41 . As a supplementary investigation , we examined the CD61 levels in LT - HSCs from Osteopontin knock - out mice and observed a 2 - fold increase in its expression in comparison to WT mice of the same age , suggesting a potential interplay between CD61 and its ligand as a compensatory system in the context of aging ( data not shown ) . This finding highlights the complexity of the interactions between CD61 and its various ligands within the ECM during aging and might explain the favored CD61 High expression in aged HSCs . Our data also show that CD61 High LT - HSCs are quiescent and functionally superior , and that inhibition of CD61 - CD51 heterodimerization induces cell cycling of CD61 High HSCs . Upon aging , alterations in the bone marrow niche may cause stress to the HSCs residing in it , and we propose that CD61 - CD51 - mediated maintenance of HSCs dormancy is one way for the stem cells to retain their repopulating potential and protect themselves against the detrimental changes of the environment . Finally , our study reveals that highly purified LT - HSCs can be further fractionated based on differential CD61 expression into populations of cells with distinct repopulating ability . Notably , a small population of aged CD61 High HSCs demonstrated comparable stem cell potential and self - renewal capacity to their young counterparts . This finding supports the existence and allows the prospective isolation of " young - like " stem cells within an aged stem cell compartment . As it has been well demonstrated that dormant HSCs engraft and repopulate better than cycling HSCs 34 , we assume that CD61 - mediated quiescence directly contributes to repopulating potential . In addition , it is likely that CD61 High LT - HSCs have accumulated less replicative stress ( supported also by lower levels of DNA damage ) , and are 13 functionally younger and more potent . If our findings can be corroborated for human HSCs , this may open avenues to prospectively isolate functionally superior stem cells for clinical transplantations .
