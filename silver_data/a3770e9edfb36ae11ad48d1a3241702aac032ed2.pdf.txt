A RT I C L E S Endocytic proteins are partitioned at the edge of the clathrin lattice in mammalian cells Kem A . Sochacki 1 , Andrea M . Dickey 1 , Marie - Paule Strub 1 and Justin W . Taraska 1 , 2 Dozens of proteins capture , polymerize and reshape the clathrin lattice during clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) . How or if this ensemble of proteins is organized in relation to the clathrin coat is unknown . Here , we map key molecules involved in CME at the nanoscale using correlative super - resolution light and transmission electron microscopy . We localize 19 different endocytic proteins ( amphiphysin1 , AP2 , β 2 - arrestin , CALM , clathrin , DAB2 , dynamin2 , EPS15 , epsin1 , epsin2 , FCHO2 , HIP1R , intersectin , NECAP , SNX9 , stonin2 , syndapin2 , transferrin receptor , VAMP2 ) on thousands of individual clathrin structures , generating a comprehensive molecular architecture of endocytosis with nanoscale precision . We discover that endocytic proteins distribute into distinct spatial zones in relation to the edge of the clathrin lattice . The presence or concentrations of proteins within these zones vary at distinct stages of organelle development . We propose that endocytosis is driven by the recruitment , reorganization and loss of proteins within these partitioned nanoscale zones . Clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) is the eukaryotic cell’s primary internalization mechanism and is central for nutrient uptake , cellular signallingandhomeostasis . Foranendocyticvesicletodevelop , dozens of unique proteins work together to recruit cargo and stabilize clathrin as a nanoscale honeycomb lattice on the membrane . Factors that associate with the lattice then regulate the growth and curvature of the pit and finally cut the coated vesicle free from the plasma membrane 1 . Decades ago , the protein EPS15 was observed at the rim of the clathrin - coated pit 2 , suggesting that the edge might be a distinct structural region important for regulating the growing vesicle . Biochemistry and imaging experiments have further led to speculative spatially organized models to explain how CME is controlled 1 , 3 – 6 . Due to the technical diﬃculty of localizing proteins at the nanoscale across large areas of the cell , however , the spatial organization of the complex and dynamic endocytic machinery is unknown . Here , in a large - scale correlative super - resolution light and transmission electron microscopy study , we map with nanometre - scale precision 19 key proteins involved in CME . Our data provide a comprehensive molecular architecture of endocytic structures across many cells . We discover a distinct spatial organization within clathrin - coated structures ; some factors localize only at the edge ( EPS15 , FCHO2 , dynamin , amphiphysin , syndapin , SNX9 ) , or centre of the lattice ( epsin , NECAP , CALM , HIP1R , receptor cargo ) , but several have discrete subpopulations in both zones ( AP2 , DAB2 , stonin2 , β 2 - arrestin , intersectin ) . Furthermore , the presence or concentrations of many factors within these zones are diﬀerent in morphologically distinct stages of organelle development . These data provide a structural framework for understanding the formation and regulation of clathrin - mediated endocytosis and a way forward to study the spatial organization of other nanoscale organelles within cells . RESULTS Correlative ﬂuorescence localization and platinum replica electron microscopy Platinum replica electron microscopy of unroofed cells provides a high - contrast nanoscale view of the clathrin lattice ( Fig . 1a ) 7 , 8 . This meshwork is visualized as flat patches , domes and vesicles attached to the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane . We previously developed a correlative super - resolution localization microscopy and platinum replica electron microscopy method to pinpoint the location of specific endocytic proteins with respect to the clathrin lattice 9 . We enabled and improved this technique here with the use of Alexa Fluor 647 - conjugated GFP - nanotrap 10 , a small ( 2 – 3nm ) nanobody specific to GFP . This provided three advantages : standardizing our imaging pipeline , placing a bright organic fluorescence label within 5nm of the target protein , and overcoming the problem of finding 19 individual well - behaved , validated , protein - specific antibodies that work with imaging .

With our super - resolution electron microscopy ( EM ) correlative imaging method we visualized clathrin - associated proteins from five broad functional categories . The first two categories ( Fig . 1b – e ) are principal structural components of the vesicle ( clathrin light chain and the major clathrin adaptor complex , AP2 ; refs 11 , 12 ) , and cargo proteins ( transferrin receptor ( TFR ; ref . 13 ) and vesicle - associated membrane protein 2 ( VAMP2 ; ref . 14 ) ) . The third ( Fig . 2 ) group includes proteins that , in addition to clathrin and AP2 ( ref . 5 ) , have been proposed to be important for the initiation of clathrin structures ( EPS15 ; refs 15 – 17 , intersectin1s ; refs 16 , 18 , FCHO2 ; refs 16 , 17 , and NECAP ; ref . 3 ) .

Proteins have distinct spatial localization with respect to the edge of the clathrin lattice After imaging , the positions of proteins on clathrin - coated structures ( CCSs ) were computationally analysed . To do this , we manually outlined clathrin patches in EM images of over 18 , 000 individual clathrin structures ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . These patches were sub - categorized as flat ( little to no visible curvature ) , domed ( curved but clathrin edge is visible ) , or highly curved ( curved beyond a hemi - sphere , nascent clathrin edge not visible ) ( Supplementary Fig . 1a – d ) . We plotted the average fluorescence pixel value as a function of distance from the EM - observed clathrin edge to obtain mean one - dimensional fluorescence intensity profiles ( 1DFLIPs ) ( see Methods ) . We binned pixels in 12nm increments , 10 bins ( 120nm ) outside the structure , and up to 7 ( 84nm ) bins toward the centre ( mean radius of a domed CCS in wild type ( WT ) ) ( Fig . 5a – d ) . The diﬀerence in curvature between a domed and flat structure causes the fluorescence from clathrin light chain to shift with respect to the edge of the lattice ( Fig . 5e – g ) . While localization microscopy had a precision of 20nm ( Supplementary Fig . 1e – i ) , slight correlation error and manual outlining broadened the 1DFLIPS ( Supplementary Fig . 1j – l ) , which 354 © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited , part of Springer Nature .

Amongst the 1DFLIPs for 18 diﬀerent clathrin - associated proteins in flat and domed CCSs ( Fig . 6 and Supplementary Fig . 2a – c ) , however , we see distinct structural trends . Thus , we classified each of these proteins into four unique categories with hierarchical clustering based on the correlation distance between their combined flat and domed 1DFLIPs ( Supplementary Fig . 2D ) . The four categories clearly separate proteins that co - localize with clathrin light chain throughout the lattice ( blue ) , from those that are regularly on the edge ( orange ) , scarce and mostly outside the structure ( red ) , and those that have fluorescence that NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 19 | NUMBER 4 | APRIL 2017 © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited , part of Springer Nature .

Highly curved CCSs were not analysed because their edges were not visible and they were prone to small movements between light and EM imaging modes causing registration errors . The structural categories generated from these imaging data are clearly diﬀerent from our previous functional classifications . Several additional correlative controls were performed to ensure that these observations were not artefacts specific to expressing GFP fusions or cell - specific diﬀerences . These include : HeLa expressing flag - tagged EPS15 and FCHO2 ( Fig . 6c , d and Supplementary Fig . 2e – i ) ; HeLa expressing σ - adaptin - GFP , a diﬀerent component of the heterotetrameric AP2 complex ( with β - adaptin ) ( Fig . 6c , d and Supplementary Fig . 2e – i ) ; HeLa labelled with seven diﬀerent protein - specific antibodies to mark endogenous proteins ( Supplementary Figs 3 – 4 ) ; SK - MEL - 2 cells labelled with five protein - specific antibodies ( Supplementary Figs 3 – 4 ) ; and SK - MEL - 2 with dynamin2 - GFP expressed from the genomic location ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) 30 . While quantity of localizations changed in some cases , we observed no obvious changes in the structural trends described above . Following overexpression of a few proteins , however , measurable changes in clathrin structure , size and density were observed , providing possible insights into their functional roles in endocytosis ( Supplementary Fig . 5 ) .

Both showed organization consistent with the categories discussed above , indicating that fixation , unroofing , labelling or EM preparations did not substantially alter the structural zones presented above . Protein position and quantity differs between different morphological stages of CME Previous live cell imaging experiments have shown that these proteins are dynamically recruited or change concentrations during the development and scission of single clathrin - coated structures in living cells 33 . Using our static nanoscale imaging method , we investigated whether the average concentrations of these proteins on flat , domed and highly curved CCSs could help give structural context to dynamic imagingdata . Todothis , butavoidcell - to - celldiﬀerencesinexpression and labelling , we measured the relative fluorescence density ratio of highly curved versus domed ( FDR cd ) , and flat versus domed CCSs ( FDR fd ) ( Fig . 7 and Supplementary Fig . 8a – c ) . In this plot , we expect that if the amount of protein scales proportionally to surface area , FDR cd ≈ 2 , FDR fd ≈ 0 . 5 ( based on sphere , hemisphere and disc surface areas ; Fig . 7 , dashed lines ) . When FDR cd > 2 ( above horizontal dashed line ) , the protein is gaining concentration and when FDR cd < 2 ( below horizontal dashed line ) the protein is losing concentration as a domed CCS gains curvature . Given that overexpression of certain proteins caused size changes in flat CCSs , and that edge proteins were found inside of large flat ‘plaques’ at breaks in the clathrin lattice ( Fig . 6 and Supplementary Fig . 8d ) , the FDR fd values were diﬃcult to interpret beyond generalized groupings of the diﬀerent structural classes . However , the FDR cd values combined with our 1DFLIP data ( Fig . 6 ) help contextualize previous live fluorescence imaging 33 and allows us to propose a spatially defined dynamic model of CME ( Fig . 8 ) 34 . This model of CME clearly separates the edge and inside of the clathrin lattice as distinct structural zones and speculates how proteins may reposition between these zones during pit maturation to drive endocytosis . The broad trends are discussed below . DISCUSSION During early stages in CME , the edge is most likely a critical zone through which all cargo must pass , curvature is highly dynamic , and growth must be carefully regulated . Thus , the biochemical components of the edge may play a key role in regulating endocytosis . As previously suggested from immunogold electron microscopy images 2 , 5 , 16 , we find EPS15 and FCHO2 to be localized solely at the edge . Here , in contrast to previous reports 35 , we show that dynamin2 is co - localized along with these proteins at the ‘edge’ zone of the clathrin lattice ( Fig . 6 ) . EPS15 and FCHO2 decrease in concentration as the pit gains curvature to become a vesicle and the edge circumference shrinks ( Fig . 7 and Supplementary Fig . 8a – c , e ) . Dynamin2 is present at a higher concentration in highly curved CCSs consistent with its enrichment during scission to form a collar ( Fig . 7 and Supplementary Fig . 8a – c , e ) . As discussed above , edge proteins are seen at the centre of large flat CCSs at sites of broken lattice ( Supplementary Fig . 8d ) , suggesting that the ‘edge’ zone is biochemically distinguished by the free unbound ends of clathrin triskelia .

The ‘inside’ zone contains seven proteins that are distributed like clathrin light chain throughout the clathrin lattice ; epsin ( 1 / 2 ) , TFR , NECAP , HIP1R , CALM and VAMP2 . For most of these proteins , the changes in concentration during maturation match those of clathrin and scale with the expected surface area of the lattice ( Fig . 7 ) . Two other ‘inside’ zone proteins , CALM and its cargo VAMP2 , are more concentrated on highly curved than domed CCSs ( Fig . 7 ) , which may indicate a relationship of these factors with high membrane curvature 36 . Of note , in the domed 1DFLIPs , our method resolves a 25nm shift inwards for TFR due to its extracellular carboxy - terminal label and a similar shift outward for HIP1R due to its radially extended C - terminal label ( Figs 3c and 6 , and Supplementary Fig . 2b , c ) 37 , 38 .

IntheFDRplot ( Fig . 7andSupplementary Fig . 8 ) these proteins cluster between the inside proteins and the edge proteins having a lower FDR cd than the inside proteins . This leads us to propose that the edge subpopulation decreases as domed CCSs invaginate and the edge develops into a neck . Of these proteins , intersectinandAP2standoutasmovinginoppositedirections ( Fig . 6 ) . Intersectin , which has 1DFLIPs like HIP1R but is most likely not long enough to be radially extended far from the membrane , appears in our measurements to move toward the edge . In contrast , AP2 repositions toward the centre as curvature increases . As an alternative , if intersectin assumes a long - extended conformation as expected for HIP1R , the 1DFLIPs could be explained by a centrifugal movement during the onset of curvature . The disappearing edge subpopulation of AP2 is consistent with live cell measurements 6 , 39 where the average AP2 fluorescence signal moves upwards into the cell at a faster rate than the average clathrin fluorescence signal . Our data , however , suggest that this change is a loss in the edge subpopulation instead of adaptors relocating to the tip of the CCS prior to scission . The observation that intersectin moves toward the edge supports the hypothesis that intersectin separates from AP2 to carry out its role in scission 18 and is consistent with the decreased presence of intersectin on purified vesicles 16 . The final group of proteins in our model , SNX9 , syndapin and am - phiphysin , are seldom on flat or domed CCSs but when they are , they are at the edge or displaced outside of the edge , usually associated with actin ( Figs 4 and 6 ) . Their high FDR cd values ( Fig . 7 ) are consistent with late - stage recruitment during scission . These proteins all have a BAR domain that binds curved membranes and an SH3 domain that binds dynamin or actin regulators . Our data are consistent with previous models that these BAR / SH3 proteins are enriched during the final stages of pit maturation along with dynamin and might aid in actin recruitment involved in membrane scission , vesicle movement and the transport of the vesicle into the cytoplasm 4 , 29 , 33 , 40 . In conclusion , clathrin structures are organized into distinct structural zones set by the edge of the lattice . From our data , we propose a hypothetical dynamic model of endocytosis where endocytosis is driven by changing populations of proteins within these nanoscale zones . In this model , during early stages , the proteins EPS15 , FCHO2 ( ref . 5 ) and dynamin are networked with the cargo - specific adaptors AP2 , β 2 - arrestin ( ref . 41 ) , stonin2 ( ref . 42 ) and DAB2 ( ref . 43 ) at the edge . As clathrin is added and cargo ( such as TFR ) is recruited , adaptors are relocated inside the lattice but dynamin , EPS15 and FCHO2 are continuously displaced to the edge 44 ( Fig . 8a ) . Meanwhile , epsin , CALM , NECAP and HIP1R are brought directly into the inside of the growing lattice , which encourages increased curvature as the lattice grows 3 , 24 , 36 , 45 ( Fig . 8b ) . As curvature increases , AP2 is depleted from the edge and intersectin moves towards the edge to prepare for scission 18 ( Fig . 8c ) . With further increases in curvature , CALM is recruited to the ‘inside zone’ bringing with it a burst in cargo including the essential SNARE protein VAMP2 ( ref . 46 ) ( Fig . 8d ) . As the neck narrows , the circumference of the edge decreases , and EPS15 , FCHO2 and intersectin 16 exit but dynamin is concentrated ( Fig . 8e ) . At scission , the dynamin collar at the edge polymerizes , recruiting additional dynamin and the BAR / SH3 domain proteins to recruit actin , which pushes the vesicle into the cytoplasm 29 , 33 , 40 , 47 ( Fig . 8f ) . Here , we identify a general architecture of clathrin - mediated endocytosis at the nanoscale . However , diﬀerent cell types express key proteinsindiﬀerentamountsorindiﬀerentforms . Thus , whilethetwo cell lines we tested did not exhibit diﬀerent localizations and we expect this zoned organization to persist across eukaryotic cells , individual components could be locally repositioned or replaced to regulate CME according to distinct mechanical , energetic , developmental or signalling needs . In the model presented here , live imaging and biochemical studies are placed into a nanometre - scale structural context to inform how the organization of protein is coordinated during clathrin - mediated endocytosis in living human cells .

HeLa cells ( ATCC CCL - 2 ) were maintained in phenol - free DMEM growth media containing DMEM ( Life Technologies 31053 - 036 ) , 10 % fetal bovine serum ( Life Technologies 26140 - 079 ) , 1 % vol / vol penicillin / streptomycin ( Invitrogen 15070 - 063 ) , 1 % vol / vol Glutamax ( Life Technologies 35050 - 061 ) , 1 % vol / volsodiumpyruvate ( SigmaS8636 - 100ML ) . Cellswereincubatedat37 ◦ C , with 5 % CO 2 . The cells were placed on gold - nanorod - embedded coverslips ( hestzig . com , part no . 600 - 200AuF ) that were previously boiled in an RCA etch solution ( 5 : 1 : 1 water / 30 % ammonia / 30 % hydrogen peroxide ) for 10min , stored in 100 % ethanol , and coated in poly - L - lysine ( Sigma P4832 ) for 20min prior to use . They were transfected with a plasmid to express the protein of interest 5 – 6h after being introduced to the coverslips . Transfection was performed overnight with 0 . 5ml of Optimem ( LifeTechnologies31985062 ) , 3 µ lLipofectamine2000 ( LifeTechnologies 11668027 ) , and 1 µ g of DNA with 2ml of added growth medium . No cell lines used in this study were found in the database of commonly misidentified cell lines that is maintained by ICLAC and NCBI Biosample . The cell lines tested negative for mycoplasma contamination . The wild - type cell lines were obtained directly from ATCC ( HeLa , 2012 ; SK - MEL - 2 , 2015 ) and used from low - passage frozen stocks but were not further authenticated . Nanobody purification and labelling . GFP - nanotrap was purified as previously described 48 . The purified GFP - nanotrap was labelled with Alexa Fluor 647 ( AF647 ) NHS ester ( Thermo Fisher 37573 ) using 2 – 6 molar excess dye for 1h at room temperature and 3 – 5h at 4 ◦ C . The labelled GFP - nanotrap was purified through a SuperDex 75 10 / 300 GL size - exclusion column and concentrated into PBS to a concentration of 18 – 35 µ M . In an SDS – PAGE gel , the labelled nanobody ran as 4 – 6 bands with relative molecular masses ranging from 14 , 000 – 17 , 000 , indicating diﬀerent species with 1 – 4 dyes per nanobody . Concentrations were estimated using A 280nm extinction coeﬃcient of 26 , 930 M − 1 cm − 1 for the GFP - nanotrap . Fixing , unroofing and labelling . After 18h of transfection , cells were rinsed in intracellularbuﬀer ( 70mMKCl , 30mMHEPESbroughttopH7 . 4withKOH , 5mM MgCl 2 , 3mM EGTA ) for 2min . They were then placed in 0 . 5 % paraformaldehyde ( Electron Microscopy Sciences 15710 ) in intracellular buﬀer and sonicated using a Branson Sonifier 450 with a 1 / 8 (cid:48) tapered microtip ( VWR International 33996 - 163 ) . Sonicationwasperformedatthelowestpossiblepowerfor400ms , 4 – 5mmabovethe coverslip . The coverslips were in fixative for less than 10s prior to sonication . After sonication , thecoverslipsweremovedtofresh2 % paraformaldehydeinintracellular buﬀer for 20min . They were then rinsed 4 × with PBS and blocked with blocking buﬀer ( 3 % bovineserum albumin ( BSA ) inphosphate - buﬀered saline ( PBS ) ) for1h atroomtemperature . Thecellswerethenlabelledwith17 . 5 – 35nMAF647nanotrap in 1ml blocking buﬀer for 1h at room temperature . During the last 15min of labelling , 16 . 5 pmol of Alexa Fluor 488 - Phalloidin ( Life Technologies A12379 ) was added . The coverslips were then rinsed 4 × with blocking buﬀer , 4 × with PBS , and then post - fixed with 2 % paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20min and imaged immediately or refrigerated overnight . Wild - type cells were not transfected . They were unroofed in 0 . 5 % paraformaldehyde and then transferred straight into 2 % glutaraldehyde prior to EM preparation . Other antibodies . For Flag - tag labelling , we used Cell Signaling no . 3916 - S , AF647 labelled rabbit anti - FLAG . This antibody was used at a final concentration of 2 µ gml − 1 with the same antibody labelling procedure as above . We also used mouse anti - clathrin heavy chain ( Pierce X - 22 ) at 1 : 1 , 000 , rabbit anti - clathrin heavy chain ( Abcam ab21679 ) at 1 : 50 for two - colour localization clathrin control , rabbit anti - EPS15 ( Cell Signaling D3K8R ) at 1 : 200 , goat anti - epsin1 ( Santa Cruz sc - 8673 , R - 20 ) at 1 : 50 , rabbit anti - FCHO2 ( Novus NBP2 - 32694 ) at 1 : 50 , goat anti - dynamin2 ( C - 18 ; Santa Cruz sc - 6400 ) at 1 : 50 for two - colour localization and 1 : 100 for correlation , rabbit anti - DAB2 ( Abcam ab33441 ) at 1 : 200 , and mouse anti - AP2 ( AP . 6 ; Pierce MA1 - 064 ) at 1 : 100 . After an hour of primary antibody labelling as discussed above , these were rinsed and labelled with the appropriate AF647 - labelled secondary antibody at 2 µ gml − 1 : goat anti - rabbit F ( ab (cid:48) ) 2 fragment ( Life Technologies A - 21246 ) , goat anti - mouse F ( ab (cid:48) ) 2 fragment ( Life Technologies A - 21237 ) , or donkey anti - goat full IgG ( Life Technologies A21447 ) . Plasmids . An existing library of GFP and flag - tag fusion plasmids were sequence - confirmed and identified as in Supplementary Table 2 . Localization fluorescence microscopy . Localization fluorescence microscopy was performed in blinking buﬀer ( 10 % w / v glucose , 0 . 8mgml − 1 glucose oxidase , 0 . 04mgml − 1 catalase , 100mM 2 - mercaptoethanol made fresh in PBS immediately before imaging ) in a sealed chamber . Imaging was performed on a Nikon NSTORM systemequippedwithanAndoriXonUltra897emccd . Priortolocalizationimaging , a 15 × 15 large image montage covering approximately 1mm 2 was acquired with 488nm and with 647nm epifluorescence excitation . This created a map of all cells in the region ( 488nm ) and which cells were expressing the target protein ( 647nm ) . Italsoallowedvisualizationofthequalityofunroofing . Localizationmicroscopywas performed on 6 – 11 regions ( 256 × 256 pixels ) with a 10kWcm − 2 , 647nm laser in deep TIRF or highly inclined ( HiLo ) illumination , 10ms frames , for 25 , 000 to 45 , 000 frames . After localization imaging and marking each region onto the large montage map , the bottom of the coverslip was etched with a 4 - mm - diameter circle using a diamond objective marker ( Leica 11505059 ) . This etched circle is the region that is subsequently processed for electron microscopy . The oil was cleaned oﬀ the coverslip , and the coverslip was rinsed with PBS and stored in 2 % glutaraldehyde at 4 ◦ C for a minimum of 1h and a maximum of 24h . Two - colourfluorescencelocalizationmicroscopy . HeLacellsweretransfectedwith Skylan 31 - clathrin light chain the night prior to fixation and immunolabelling as described above for other transfections . In HeLa cells , endogenous proteins of interest were labelled using protein - specific primary antibodies and Alexa Fluor 647 - labelled secondary antibodies . Labelling was performed as above except cells remained intact . After growth on nanorod embedded coverslips as above , cells were rinsed twice with Imaging Buﬀer ( 10mM HEPES , 130mM NaCl , 2 . 8mM KCl , 5mM CaCl 2 , 1mM MgCl 2 , 10mM glucose , 5 % FBSatpH7 . 4 ) andthenfixedin2 % paraformaldehydeinImagingBuﬀer for 20min . They were then rinsed with PBS 4 × . Cells were permeabilized with 0 . 5 % Triton - X , 3 % BSA in PBS and blocked in Blocking Buﬀer ( 0 . 2 % Triton - X , 3 % BSA inPBS ) for1hatroomtemperature . Cellswerethenexposedtoprimaryantibodyat the concentration listed above in Blocking Buﬀer for 1h . They were rinsed 4 × with Blocking Buﬀer and then exposed to secondary antibody at the concentration listed above for 30min . Cells were rinsed 4 × , fixed again with 2 % paraformaldehyde in PBS , and stored in PBS for less than 24h before imaging . Imaging of Alexa Fluor 647 was performed as described above except at 9ms framesandinsomecasesasfewas10 , 000frames . BlinkingbuﬀerwasmadeinaTris buﬀer ( 50mM Tris - HCl ( pH7 . 5 ) , 10mM NaCl ) instead of PBS because Skylan is sensitivetopH . Skylanwasimagedat ∼ 1kWcm − 2 with20 – 40msexposuretimefor 5 , 000 to 10 , 000 frames . Imaging of Alexa Fluor 647 was performed first and Skylan second . The images were then processed using Nikon Elements where minimum peak height = 200 , maximum height = 65 , 535 , camera baseline = 100 , minimum width = 200nm , maximum width = 400nm , initial fit width = 300nm , maximum axial ratio = 1 . 3 , maximum displacement = 1 pixel . All data were filtered with minimum photons = 500 and rendered with 8nm pixels . The resulting images were laterally shifted with respect to one another in MATLAB ( the Mathworks ) until findingthemaximalimagecorrelationvalue . Goldfiduciallocalizations , whichwere then in the same location by eye , were used to obtain exact centroid values of the fiducials in green and red . These values were then used to do a more exact aﬃne transformation of the red onto the green image . Refined correlation was performed with other independent image features in the DAB2 data due to insuﬃcient gold . Super - resolution total - internal reflection fluorescence - structured illumination microscopy ( TIRF - SIM ) . TIRF - SIM imaging 32 was performed on a DeltaVision OMX SR ( GE ) microscope equipped with an Olympus 60 × 1 . 42 NA PlanApo N objective . Imaging of live cells expressing clathrin - associated proteins of interest as GFP fusions and mCherry - clathrin light chain was done in Imaging Buﬀer ( 10mM HEPES , 130mM NaCl , 2 . 8mM KCl , 5mM CaCl 2 , 1mM MgCl 2 , 10mM glucose , 5 % FBS at pH7 . 4 ) at 37 ◦ C . Raw images were reconstructed using softWoRx 6 . 5 . 2 ( GE ) . For SIM data processing a Weiner constant of 0 . 001 was used and images zero - clipped to remove negative pixel values . Two - colour images were aligned with a field of 100nm TetraSpeck beads ( Thermo Fisher ) acquired before and after each imagingsessionwithcustomalignmentsoftwarewritteninMATLAB ( Mathworks ) . Reconstructed pixels were 40nm . SK - MEL - 2 correlative controls . SK - MEL - 2 cells , and SK - MEL - 2 hDNM2 EN ( which were a generous gift from D . Drubin , used without further authentication ) 30 were grown in cell culture as described above . However , coverslips were coated with fibronectin ( 0 . 1 % , Sigma F0895 ) diluted 1 : 100 in PBS . Unroofing was performed in the same way but with 2 % paraformaldehyde present during the unroofing sonication pulse . For dynamin controls , SK - MEL - 2 cells were transfected for one day in a T - 75 flask , sorted with fluorescence - activated cell sorting ( FACS ) ( Aria II ; BDBiosciences ) forGFP - positivecellsthefollowingdayandgrownoncoverslipsfor one more day before fixation and unroofing . No phalloidin was used on SK - MEL - 2 cells . SK - MEL - 2 WT cells were used as a control only for the dynamin2 data where indicated . All other correlative data were performed on SK - MEL - 2 hDNM2 EN . Electronmicroscopy . Coverslipsweremovedstraightfromglutaraldehydeinto0 . 1 % w / v tannic acid ( freshly dissolved in water ) for 20min . They were then rinsed 4 × with water and placed in 0 . 1 % w / v uranyl acetate for 20min . The coverslips were then dehydrated , critical point dried , and coated with platinum and carbon as previously described 49 . The region of interest on the coverslip was imaged with 10 × © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited , part of Springer Nature . All rights reserved . NATURE CELL BIOLOGY DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncb3498 M E T H O D S phase contrast to obtain another map of the imaged region . The replicas were lifted as previously described 9 and placed onto Formvar / carbon - coated 75 - mesh copper TEM grids ( Ted Pella 01802 - F ) that were recently glow - discharged . Again , the grid was imaged with 10 × phase contrast to find the same region that was originally imaged in fluorescence . Each cell of interest was located on the grid prior to EM imaging . Some cells were lost behind grid bars . TEM imaging was performed as previouslydescribed 9 at15 , 000 × magnification ( 1 . 2nmperpixel ) usingaJEOL1400 and SerialEM freeware for montaging 50 . Image processing and correlation . Localization data were processed using Nikon Elements 4 . 0 . The identification parameters for all HeLa correlation data were : minimum height = 100 – 200 , maximum height = 65 , 535 , CCD baseline = 100 , minimum width = 200nm , maximum width = 400nm , initial fit width = 300nm , maximumaxialratio = 1 . 3 , maximumdisplacement = 1pixel . Thedatawerefiltered assuming 0 . 18 photons per count with 50 – 300minimum photons . Drift correction by image cross - correlation was performed by Nikon Elements and isolated gold nanorods visible in the images appeared as single axially symmetric clusters of fluorescence localizations . Precision for Alexa Fluor 647 data was estimated at 20nm based on the full - width at half - maximum of isolated fluorescent peaks ( Supplementary Fig . 1e – i ) . The images were generated by Nikon Elements with Gaussian rendering at 5nm pixel resolution with uncertainty depicted as previously described 51 . Two - colour data , SK - MEL - 2 data , and HeLa antibody data for AP2 , DAB2 and dynamin2 were rendered with Nikon Elements version 4 . 1 at 8nm pixel resolution . Electron microscopy montages were processed using IMOD freeware 52 . Fluorescence images were mapped onto electron microscopy montages using three isolated gold nanorods . The Gaussian centres from the gold nanoparticles in the fluorescence localization image were mapped to the centres of the particles visible in EM using an aﬃne spatial transformation with nearest - neighbour interpolation . Aftertransformation , theothergoldnanoparticleswerevisuallycheckedfortightco - localization . In the case that the other nanoparticles were not co - localized , diﬀerent nanoparticles were used for the spatial transformation . Image analysis . A single ‘cell’ as designated in this manuscript refers to a single correlated image . These images can be assumed to be only a portion of a full cell membrane . Wearelimitedtoimagingonlywhatisleftbehindafterunroofingandwe alsolimitourEMimagingto475 µ m 2 sobowingoftheEMgridmembranedoesnot aﬀect correlation error . There are three cases where two separate correlation images couldhavecomefromthesameoriginalcell ( SNX9 , β - arrestin , clathrinlightchain ) . Looking at only the EM images , each clathrin structure was outlined at the edge of the visible clathrin meshwork using ImageJ 53 . Flat CCSs were identified as honeycomb objects with no visible curvature . Flat CCSs touching one another were all considered one single structure . Domed CCSs were identified as honeycomb objects with visible curvature that we could still see where the clathrin mesh met themembrane . HighlycurvedCCSswereidentifiedashoneycombobjectsthatwere invaginated to the point that we could not see where the clathrin met the membrane from a cytoplasmic view . Domed and highly curved CCSs were generally outlined using an elliptical tool , while flat CCSs were generally outlined with a freestyle tool . Clathrin regions were not outlined or analysed if they were within 500nm of the membrane edge or a gold particle ( Supplementary Fig . 1a – d ) . This is because the edge often experiences curling during EM processing that introduces registration errors and the gold localizations interfere with AF647 localizations . A binary mask of the domed , flat and highly curved CCSs and area analysed ( excluding edges and gold ) was created in ImageJ ( Supplementary Fig . 1a – d ) . This mask was used in conjunction with the spatially transformed localization image to analysethefluorescenceassociatedwiththeclathrinstructures . Thesewereimported intoacustomMATLAB ( TheMathworks ) programfortheremainderoftheanalysis . Edge fluorescence profiles ( 1DFLIPs ) . Ten - pixel ( 12nm ) bins outside and inside the edge of a structure were created by dilating or eroding the mask of each separate structure with a ten - pixel disc . Only structures with fluorescence inside or within 60nmoftheedgewereincludedinthe1DFLIPanalysis . Eachstructurewasanalysed with 10 bins outside of the edge border and 7 bins inside of the edge border unless the structure was too small to allow for 7 bins . We chose 7 bins inside of the structurebasedontheaverageradiusofadomedCCSinwild - typecells . Theaverage fluorescence in each bin ( sum fluorescence signal divided by pixel number ) created a profile for each structure . All of the profiles from each cell and structure type were averaged together . The maximum intensity from the single - cell average profile was used as a normalization factor for each separate profile when the profiles from diﬀerent cells were combined as averages . Relative fluorescence density ratio ( FDR ) measurements . The density of fluorescence ( FD ) associated with each structure was found by taking the pixel average of all pixels in the spatially transformed fluorescence image within 60nm of the object as it was circled in EM . For each cell , we found the average density associated with domed CCSs : FD domed , cell = (cid:80) ndomeddomed = 1 ( FD domed ) ndomed Then we found ratios of total fluorescence associated with highly curved to domed CCSs and flat to domed CCSs as shown in Fig . 3 .

Thesemeasurements are diﬀerent because they do not account for the area of the structure . Instead , they are useful in understanding how the total amount of proteins on an object may be changing as a structure matures .

( e ) Horizontal linescans through the center of images shown in ( e - h ) . The grey dotted lines are drawn down from the approximate half height to show that the localization precision can be described by the full - width at half max ( ~ 20 nm ) . ( j ) To understand how correlation error may affect our analysis , we induced additional correlation error into our existing experiments to see how the 1DFLIPs would change . All data used to study nanotrap labeled GFP - clathrin in HeLa cells were analyzed again with an additional lateral shift of the distance described ( 0 , 24 , 48 , or 72 nm ) . This artifically induced a correlation error causing a decrease in 1DFLIP slope . ( k ) The same induced correlation error analysis was done on nanotrap labeled EPS15 - GFP HeLa data . ( l ) A theoretical ring of fluorescence with 120 nm diameter was convolved with a Gaussian of 20 nm full - width at half maximum . The Gaussian width was chosen based off the localiza - tion microscopy precision measured in ( e - i ) . This modeled ring was then shifted with respect to the analyzed circle as was done in ( b ) for real data . According to this analysis , the slope of the data is largely dependent on the correlation error or outlining precision . The slope in our data is regularly 40 nm over half height indicating that correlation error and outlining precision are similar throughout different images . ( a - b ) Scale , 4 µm .

( a ) Data of nanotrap - labeled GFP - clathrin light chain on CCSs from Fig . 5e are shown with cell - to - cell averaging and standard deviation . 1DFLIPs from flat ( b ) and domed ( c ) CCSs are shown for the 18 clathrin - associated proteins studied also shown with cell - to - cell averaging and standard deviation . The N value listed is number of cells . Clathrin data from ( a ) is referenced in black . ( d ) Dendrogram of 1DFLIPs hierarchical clustering . For each protein that was studied , the flat 1DFLIP was appended to the domed 1DFLIP making a single linescan . The clustering was based on the correlation distance ( one minus the correlation value ) between points . This clustering was done using the Matlab function “linkage . m” . This is a way of grouping the 1DFLIP pairs from each data set with others of a similar shape . The results from the automated clustering are similar to how one would cluster these linescans by eye . ( e - i ) Control protein 1DFLIPs . Clathrin Heavy Chain Antibody is compared to clathrin light chain GFP labeling for domed and flat CCSs . ( b ) Epsin1 antibody is shown in comparison to epsin1 - GFP data . In ( a - b ) , the antibody data shifts slightly outward which is likely due to the 25 nm antibody tether . ( c ) EPS15 - GFP ( AF647 GFP - nanotrap ) is compared with EPS15 - flag ( direct primary antibody AF647 labeling ) and EPS15 primary and secondary labeling using anti - EPS15 . Low - expression in the EPS15 - flag data caused increased sampling noise . ( d ) GFP - FCHO2 ( AF647 GFP - nano - trap ) is compared with flag - FCHO2 ( direct primary antibody AF647 labeling ) and FCHO2 primary and secondary labeling using anti - FCHO2 . Less than 25 % of clathrin structures were labeled ( Table S1 ) with anti - FCHO2 antibody and those that were labeled had only one label causing increased error . ( e ) GFP - β - adaptin is compared with σ - adaptin - GFP . These are both components of AP2 and exhibit the same trend in domed and flat CCSs . Additional antibody data was used for in depth dynamin analysis ( Supp . Fig . 4 ) , or visual comparison of SK - MEL - 2 vs . HeLa cells ( Supp . Fig . 3 ) .

( a ) A histogram of the two - dimensional area of domed , flat , and highly curved CCSs in WT HeLa cells measured from platinum - replica EM images . There is a broad range of sizes . This highlights the need to look at a large amount of data before making statements about sizes changing due to overexpression or knock - out experiments . Domed CCSs occupy on average a larger area than highly curved CCSs consistent with pits needing to increase their curvature to become a vesicle . Some flat CCSs are quite large and likely could yield mul - tiple domed CCSs . ( b ) The density of flat CCSs is plotted versus the median area of flat CCSs for all the data discussed in this paper . Most notably , cells overexpressing EPS15 - gfp , amphiphysin1 - gfp , and gfp - SNX9 all exhibited small flat CCSs at a higher density than in wild type . Cells overexpressing dynamin2 - gfp exhibited abnormally large flat CCSs . ( c ) The density of domed CCSs is plotted versus the median area of domed CCSs for all the data . ( d ) The density of highly curved CCSs versus the median area of highly curved CCSs for all data discussed in this paper . For ( b - d ) the median areas from each cell were combined to obtain an average and standard deviation amongst the cells . The average and standard deviation of structure density amongst the cells is also shown . ( e - g ) All area data shown in ( b - d ) are shown as box plots ( 25 - 75 % boxes , whiskers set with outlier coefficient of 1 . 5 , central line is median ) . The median areas from each cell are also shown as grey diamonds . WT HeLa cells with are highlighted in red . Each plot is organized in the order of decreasing median area . Little change is observed in domed or highly rounded CCSs but there is a notable change in the area of flat CCSs for some proteins .

( a - c ) Fluorescence density ratios from Fig . 7 are shown are shown as box plots . The box plots are 25 - 75 percentiles and the whiskers are set with an outlier coefficient of 1 . 5 . All proteins are listed in order of decreasing mean FDR rds . Gray diamonds are means from all separate cells imaged for that protein . The cell averages in ( b ) middle plot are all one because all FDRs are ratios with respect to the mean domed fluorescence density per cell . ( d ) Edge proteins found within flat CCSs are found where there is a broken lattice . Images from the three edge proteins , EPS15 , FCHO2 , and dynamin are shown with correlative images on the left ( fluorescence in magenta ) and EM only images on the right . At the locations where it looks like the edge protein is located in the middle of the CCS , the EM images show that the clathrin lattice is broken . Scale bar , 400 nm . ( e ) Absolute fluorescence ratios . The absolute highly curved to domed CCS fluorescence ratio ( mean ) is plotted against the absolute flat to domed CCS fluorescence ratio ( mean ) . This plot is similar to Fig . 3 except the sizes of the structures are not taken into account . Therefore , this plot shows that on average , a domed CCS turning into a highly - curved CCS gains 25 - 50 % more clathrin . Similarly , it shows that over 50 % of the edge proteins , EPS15 and FCHO2 decrease in concentration as the average domed CCS turns into the average highly curved CCS . The flat - to - domed ratios are more difficult to interpret because some flat CCSs in HeLa cells are quite large and most likely turn into several pits . Standard error is shown . N values are based off sepa - rate CCSs as given in Supplementary Table 1 . Number of cells , structures , membrane area imaged , related protein controls , and independent coverslips imaged are listed in Supplementary Table 1 .

Supplementary Table Legends Supplementary Table 1 Table of the amount of data included in each of the separate data categories . The data categories include WT HeLa cells , the 19 GFP protein fusions studied in the paper with GFP - nanotrap labeling , seven antibody labeled proteins ( Ig ) , two flag - tagged proteins labeled with anti - flag primary Ig , and GFP - nanotrap labeled σ - adaptin - gfp control . For each category , the table shows the number of cells ( separate correlated image regions ) , the number of separate coverslips imaged , the total number of flat , domed , and highly curved CCSs in those images , the number of flat , domed , and highly curved CCSs that had fluorescence associated with them , and the total membrane area that was imaged . The number of structures containing fluorescence should not be considered as biologically significant because : 1 ) the value often includes structures that have fluorescence on a neighboring structure , 2 ) expression levels cause significant , cell - to - cell variability in these values , 3 ) the very low threshold set for determining if fluorescence is present may pick up background localizations . The value is included to show how many structures were included in the 1DFLIP data . Supplementary Table 2 Table of sequence - confirmed plasmid information .
