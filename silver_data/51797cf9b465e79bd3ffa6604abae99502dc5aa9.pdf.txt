ORIGINAL ARTICLE Open Access Gender Variance Among Youth with Autism Spectrum Disorders : A Retrospective Chart Review Aron Janssen , 1 , * Howard Huang , 2 and Christina Duncan 2 Abstract Purpose : Increasing clinical evidence suggests an overrepresentation of gender variance ( GV ) among patients with autism spectrum disorders ( ASDs ) . This retrospective chart review aims to contribute to the existing litera - ture on co - occurring ASD and gender dysphoria ( GD ) . We compare the rate of parent - reported GV in patients with an ASD diagnosis to that of parent - reported GV in a normative nonreferred data set . Methods : Child Behavior Checklist ( CBCL ) charts were collected from 492 children and adolescents ( 409 natal males and 83 natal females ) aged 6 – 18 years who have received a diagnosis of ASD at the New York University Child Study Center . Parent - reported GV was determined through endorsement of CBCL sex item 110 , which assesses the presence of gender - related issues . We calculated the odds ratio of endorsement of item 110 be - tween our ASD sample and the CBCL sample data . Results : The subjects diagnosed with ASD were 7 . 76 times more likely to report GV than the CBCL sample . This ﬁnding was statistically signiﬁcant . About 5 . 1 % of the patients in the ASD group and 0 . 7 % of the CBCL nonre - ferred group endorsed sex item 110 . 5 . 1 % of natal males and 4 . 8 % of natal females endorsed sex item 110 . Nei - ther gender nor age inﬂuenced the rate of endorsement . Conclusion : This ﬁnding supports the growing research suggesting a heightened co - occurrence rate of ASD and GD . Focus should be placed upon improving our understanding of the nature of this co - occurrence and on gender identity development within the atypical development of ASD . Key words : child and adolescent development ; gender dysphoria ; mental health Introduction Autism spectrum disorders ( ASDs ) are a set of neurode - velopmental disorders that are characterized by impair - ments in social communication skills and repetitive and restricted interests and behaviors . 1 There is increas - ing evidence that suggests an association between gender dysphoria ( GD ) , gender variance ( GV ) , and ASDs . 2 – 4 GD is a DSM - 5 diagnosis characterized by distress caused by a persistent incongruence between one’s natal sex and expressed gender , 1 and GV is a broader term that describes any numbers of variability between assigned sex and experienced / expressed gender . An in - creasing number of researchers and practitioners have noticed a high rate of co - occurrence between GD and / or GV and ASDs . Many case studies have suggested an overrepresentation of GD among clients with ASDs and vice versa . 5 – 8 De Vries et al . 4 systematically measured this overrepresentation in a large - scale Dutch - based 1 NYU Child Study Center , New York , New York . 2 New York University , New York , New York . * Address correspondence to : Aron Janssen , MD , NYU Child Study Center , New York , New York .

Among clients who presented for evaluation at a gender clinic in Amsterdam , a prevalence rate of 7 . 8 % was reported for ASDs . This is much higher than the prevalence rate expected for the general population in Northern Europe , which ranges from 0 . 3 % to 1 . 16 % . 9 Another study based in North America examined this association in the opposite direction . 3 It was found that 5 . 4 % of the subjects diagnosed with ASD answered positively for sex item 110 ( ‘‘wish to be opposite sex’’ ) on the Child Behavior Checklist ( CBCL ) . 3 , 10 This is sig - niﬁcantly higher than the rate of positive response expected of the general population , 0 . 7 % . 10 Despite these convincing results and their obvious clinical implications , literature on the co - occurrence of ASD and GD remains inchoate . The present study is a retrospective chart review that aims to contribute to this topic by exploring the following hypotheses in a child and adolescent mental health clinic based in New York City : 1 . In congruence with previous large - scale ﬁndings , 3 , 4 we expect a heightened rate of endorsement of sex item 110 on the CBCL in our local ASD sample compared to the nonreferred normative CBCL standardization data . 10 2 . Previous studies have suggested similar rates of gender - related issues between natal males and females diag - nosed with co - occurring ASD . 3 , 4 We expect to ﬁnd sim - ilar rates of endorsement of sex item 110 between natal males and natal females within the local ASD sample . 3 . Previous research has consistently shown a high rate of desistance in transgender identity among children as they grow into adolescence . 11 , 12 We hypothesize that this trend of desistance may also be present among the local ASD samples , presented by a negative correlation between age and rate of endorsement of sex item 110 . Methods All study activities were approved by the Institutional Review Board at the NYU Langone Medical Center , and patient data were protected by strictly following the approved methods and use of deidentiﬁed data . All data were manually entered into IBM SPSS Statis - tics , version 23 . Descriptive statistics ( frequencies , means , and standard deviations [ SD ] ) were calculated . Signiﬁcance tests ( chi - square test , Fisher’s exact test , and independent t - tests ) , odds ratios , and logistic re - gression models were calculated on R and the package ‘‘psych . ’’ 13 The present study is a retrospective chart review . CBCLs were collected from all patients who were be - tween ages 6 and 18 years and had received formal di - agnoses of ASDs ( i . e . , ASD , Asperger’s syndrome , pervasive developmental disorders , and all associated not otherwise speciﬁed [ NOS ] diagnoses ) between January 2011 and January 2015 at the New York University ( NYU ) Child Study Center in midtown Manhattan , New York City . Using this method , CBCL charts were pulled from 492 subjects . The average age of the sample was 8 . 96 years ( SD = 2 . 704 , age range : 6 – 18 years ) . Of these subjects , 409 ( 83 . 1 % ) were natal males and 83 ( 16 . 9 % ) were natal females . This is a fairly typical sex ratio of the ASD population , wherein males receive the diagnosis roughly four times more fre - quently than females . 9 Normative data were obtained from the nonreferred standardization sample of the CBCL ( N = 1605 ) . 10 Par - ticipant characteristics of both normative control group and our local sample group are summarized in Table 1 . Compared to the normative CBCL data , our sample was signiﬁcantly younger , t ( 1022 ) = 18 . 64 , p < 0 . 0001 . This signiﬁcant difference was addressed through logistic regression analysis and data manipula - tion . The natal sex ratio in our sample was signiﬁcantly more male than that in the normative CBCL data ( w 2 = 142 . 34 , p < 0 . 01 ) . Data on race , ethnicity , and so - cioeconomic status were not available for comparison between the normative data and local sample . CBCL charts are collected from all patients upon ini - tial evaluation as a part of standard care at the NYU Child Study Center . CBCL is an extensive checklist for both parent and self - report in assessing internalizing and externalizing behaviors , as well as a number of other speciﬁc behavioral problems . 10 In the present study , all CBCL charts had been ﬁlled out by the pa - tients’ parents . The CBCL is considered a ‘‘gold standard’’ for child and adolescent clinical evaluations . The present study looked particularly at sex item 110 on the CBCL , ‘‘wish to be opposite sex . ’’ Endorsement of sex item 110 with the responses ‘‘sometimes true’’ or ‘‘very true’’ has been Table 1 .

For the purpose of analyses , two groups were formed : those who answered the item negatively ( never true ) and those who answered positively ( some - what or sometimes true and very true or often true ) . It is worth mentioning , however , that endorsement of sex item 110 does not equate with a DSM - 5 diagno - sis of GD . In fact , it has been found that among a gender variant Dutch sample , Gender Identity Disor - der ( GID ) - NOS or transvestic fetishism appeared to occur more frequently among the gender referrals with ASD than among those without ASD . However , a majority of the patients in the study with ASD still met criteria for GID and were found to be appropriate for medical / surgical intervention . 4 Sex item 110 only assesses the presence of possible gender - related issues and GV and cannot provide further insight as to the particular clinical presentation or formal diagnoses of the child . Results Hypothesis 1 About 5 . 1 % of the local ASD sample endorsed sex item 110 . Of the ASD sample in Strang et al . , 3 5 . 4 % endorsed sex item 110 , as did 0 . 7 % of the nonreferred sample from CBCL standardization sample . 10 Percen - tages of endorsement by parents of item 110 among samples from our local clinic , Strang et al . , 3 and CBCL nonreferred data are shown in Figure 1 . Odds ratio was calculated between our ASD group and the nonreferred sample from CBCL nonreferred norma - tive data . Compared to the CBCL group , local subjects diagnosed with ASDs were 7 . 76 times more likely to report GV , which was statistically signiﬁcant . Table 2 summarizes the odds ratio ( OR ) , 95 % conﬁdence in - tervals , and p - values of the present study and those of Strang et al . 3 In response to the signiﬁcant age difference be - tween the local ASD sample and CBCL normative data , we randomly deleted participants younger than 10 years until the average age of the manipulated data set matched that of the CBCL data . This proce - dure , along with OR calculations , was repeated three times . Calculated ORs were statistically signiﬁcant for all three manipulated data sets and ranged from 8 . 25 to 9 . 22 . It should be noted , however , that 325 participants had to be deleted each time , leaving the manipulated sample sizes to be 167 . Nonetheless , lo - gistic regression from hypothesis 3 revealed no signif - icant age effect on the rate of endorsement . It is thus reasonable to infer that the rate of endorsement of sex item 110 was heightened across all age groups in our ASD sample . Hypothesis 2 Of the 492 subjects reviewed , 25 endorsed sex item 110 ( 5 . 1 % ) . Of these 25 individuals , 21 were natal males ( 5 . 1 % of all 409 natal males ) and 4 were natal females ( 4 . 8 % of all 83 natal females ) . A Fisher’s exact test revealed no signiﬁcant level of gender effect on the rate of endorsement ( p = 1 ) . Hypothesis 3 To evaluate the potential effect of age on the rates of endorsing sex item 110 , we modeled the indicator for Table 2 .

There was no evidence that age is related to the endorsement of sex item 110 ( b = 0 . 056 , se ( b ) = 0 . 074 , Wald’s t = 0 . 571 , p = 0 . 45 ) . Discussion and Limitations The present study joins a gradually growing body of lit - erature on the co - occurrence of ASD and gender - related issues among child and adolescent clinical populations . In comparing a local sample of patients diagnosed with ASDs with nonreferred normative data , we ﬁnd an elevated rate of GV . It is found that endorsement of sex item 110 , ‘‘wish to be opposite sex , ’’ is 7 . 76 times more likely among participants with an ASD diag - nosis than in a nonreferred comparison group . The ele - vation in endorsement remains signiﬁcant even after several adjustments for age differences between our local ASD sample and CBCL normative data . This ﬁnd - ing is in congruence with those from several previous studies . 3 , 4 , 15 , 16 In particular , our results are highly compa - rable to those of Strang et al . 3 In that study , as in ours , the response options of ‘‘sometimes true’’ and ‘‘very true’’ were counted as afﬁrmative responses to item 110 . Our study was not designed to differentiate between these two groups , and further investigation into its signiﬁcance is warranted . With one of the largest ASD sample sizes ( N = 429 ) to date , the present study provides strong evi - dence to the co - occurrence of ASD and GV—a topic that has heretofore been largely documented through single - case studies . Also congruent with previous ﬁndings , no gender effect has been found that contributes to the endorse - ment of GV among the local ASD samples . The rate of endorsement of sex item 110 among natal male participants ( 5 . 1 % ) is virtually the same as that of natal female participants ( 4 . 8 % ) . However , there have been several recent studies that suggest differ - ences in hormonal and physiological , 17 perinatal , 15 and clinical presentations between male and female patients who receive a co - occurrent diagnosis of ASD . 18 Although no difference in prevalence rate of GV has been found between male and female ASD clients , further research on the etiological and symptomatic presentations between the two groups is encouraged . A logistic regression reveals no age effect on the rate of endorsement of sex item 110 . In this sample , youn - ger children were as likely to endorse this item as ado - lescents . This is in contrast to the high rate of desistance in studies of childhood GV . 11 , 12 However , without follow - up CBCL data , we cannot make conclusions about the persistence or desistance of GV of individuals included in this data set . Generally , children demonstrate the ability to dis - criminate faces and voices by sex by 9 – 11 months 19 and reach gender constancy by 5 years of age in step - wise progressions . 20 – 22 There is preliminary evidence that , at least for gender distinction , individuals with ASDs may experience persistent impairment in gender - related developments . 23 – 26 Furthermore , a study by de Vries et al . 4 suggests that for some people with ASD , transgender identities may deviate from those of neuro - typical individuals . Individuals with ASDs were much more frequently diagnosed with GID - NOS and transves - tic fetishism than the neurotypical control group . 4 Although literature in gender identity development among individuals with ASDs is limited , there is at least some evidence that suggests uniqueness in gender - related concerns among individuals with ASDs . We hypothesize that such uniqueness may inﬂuence the presentation , development , and expression of GV among some individ - uals with ASDs . These ﬁndings have obvious conceptual and clini - cal implications . These ﬁndings contribute to the lit - erature that suggests increased rates of GV among individuals with ASDs . Given this increased preva - lence , practitioners working with youth with ASDs should screen for gender identity concerns . However , one must be careful not to infer a direct relationship with an afﬁrmative response on the CBCL and a DSM - 5 diag - nosis of GD , particularly given the increased prevalence of transvestic fetishism and GID - NOS among individu - als with ASDs . 4 Gender development is a complex pro - cess involving biological , psychological , and cognitive elements that are inﬂuenced by social norms . As such , individuals with ASDs may present with variance in their gender identity and expression that may defy easy categorization . Clinical practice must take into ac - count the social , cognitive , and developmental trajecto - ries of patients with ASDs to personalize treatment plans and ensure that individuals with ASDs are able to maintain their autonomy and have equal access to gender - related care . There are several limitations to the present study . First , the present study recruited clinical samples only , and future research is encouraged to explore the co - occurrence between ASD and GV in nonre - ferred populations . Janssen , et al . ; Transgender Health 2016 , 1 . 1 http : / / online . liebertpub . com / doi / 10 . 1089 / trgh . 2015 . 0007 66 Second , due to the retrospective nature of the pres - ent study , data collection was limited to preexisting mea - surements that provided only categorical data . Not all the desired demographic and clinical information was avail - able in the data set . While the Autism Diagnostic Obser - vation Schedule is most frequently used at the NYU Child Study Center to diagnose ASDs , the type of evaluation used to conﬁrm the diagnosis of an ASD was not available in this data set . The atypi - cality of the presentation of GV among individuals with ASDs warrants more encompassing measure - ment . Although sex item 110 on the CBCL has been shown to accurately assess GV , more compre - hensive measurements should be used in the future . Similar limitations are true for ASD - related mea - surements as well : Standardized measures of intellec - tual ability or ASD severity were unavailable for the present study . The use of standardized , comprehen - sive , and dimensional instruments for both autistic traits and GV is recommended for future research . Last , the present study did not explore the potential etiological factors behind the co - occurrence of ASDs and GV . Future research is encouraged to collect data on a wide array of factors—in particular , birth weight , 15 social awareness , and severity of ASD symptoms 3 , 15 have been suggested as major factors behind this phe - nomenon and deserve further investigation . Conclusions The present study is a large - scale retrospective preva - lence study that conﬁrms a heightened level of co - occurrence of ASDs and GV . It joins a growing body of literature that consistently suggests such co - occurrence . Longitudinal research is recommended to further our understanding of this phenomenon , espe - cially in regard to gender identity development within the atypical developmental time frame of child and ad - olescent patients presenting with ASDs . In terms of clinical implications , although there is no current con - sensus regarding the treatment of children presenting with both ASDs and GV , this high rate of co - occurrence warrants more efforts in screening for GV among autistic patients , as well as autistic symptoms among those who present with GV . Furthermore , more focus should be placed on deciphering the appro - priate and individualized classiﬁcation of gender - related issues among children and adolescents diag - nosed with ASDs . Facilitating our patients’ experience and understanding of their gender identity and expres - sion may be an important focus in treating clients with ASDs who also present with GV . It is hoped that future research may provide both scientiﬁc and clinical in - sights as to the nature of this phenomenon and best care strategies .
