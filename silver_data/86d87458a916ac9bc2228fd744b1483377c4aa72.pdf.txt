The long - range early endosomal trafficking during the hyphal 16 growth is crucial for nutrient uptake , sensing of host - specific cues , and regulation of effector 17 production . Bin1 / Amphiphysin / Rvs167 ( BAR ) domain - containing proteins mediate fundamental 18 cellular processes , including membrane remodeling and endocytosis . Here , we identified an F - 19 BAR domain protein ( ArF - BAR ) in the necrotrophic fungus Ascochyta rabiei and demonstrate 20 its involvement in endosome - dependent fungal virulence on the host plant , Cicer arietinum . We 21 show that ArF - BAR regulates endocytosis at the hyphal tip , localizes to the early endosomes , 22 and is involved in actin dynamics . Functional studies involving gene knockout and 23 complementation experiments reveal that ArF - BAR is essential for virulence . The loss - of - 24 function of ArF - BAR results in delayed formation of first septa from the hyphal tip , crucial for 25 host penetration and proliferation . ArF - BAR was induced in response to oxidative stress and 26 infection and localized to endocytic vesicles within the fungal hyphae . We also show that ArF - 27 BAR is able to tubulate synthetic liposomes , suggesting the functional role of F - BAR domain in 28 membrane tubule formation in vivo . Further , our studies identified a stress - induced transcription 29 factor , ArCRZ1 ( Calcineurin - responsive zinc finger 1 ) as key regulator for transcriptional 30 reprogramming of ArF - BAR . We propose a model in which ArCRZ1 functions upstream of ArF - 31 BAR to regulate fungal pathogenesis through a mechanism that involves membrane remodeling 32 and actin cytoskeleton regulation . 33 34 Author summary 35 BAR - domain superfamily is known to mold amorphous lipid bilayer into defined tubular shapes 36 and critical for endosome formation and trafficking . Although these processes are studied earlier 37 in the context of their structural and biochemical properties , there is limited evidence on the 38 direct role of F - BAR domain proteins in the pathophysiological development of other 39 economically important fungi . Our study assumes functional significance for plant infection as 40 we identified an F - BAR domain - containing protein that is regulated by a distinct transcriptional 41 network . We characterized F - BAR in a necrotrophic fungal pathogen , Ascochyta rabiei that 42 causes the Ascochyta blight ( AB ) disease in chickpea plants . Additionally , we have also 43 identified a calcium - regulated CRZ1 transcription factor that regulates the transcription of ArF - 44 BAR . Our study will help to understand the complex interplay underlying the endosome 45 formation required for fungal virulence . 46 47 Introduction 48 Polarized hyphal growth is a signature feature of filamentous fungi during host colonization [ 1 ] . 49 This feature allows the fungus to sense , coordinate , and respond to an array of cues from the host 50 [ 2 ] . Therefore , regulation of hyphal tip growth is one of the major virulence determinants in 51 filamentous fungi . In response to infection , the plant innate immune system recognizes 52 pathogens and fosters effective defense responses . Pathogens must recognize the plant surface 53 cues and counter host - generated defense responses for effective pathogenesis . Additionally , 54 invasive fungi must overcome an intracellular challenge posed by the distance between the 55 elongated invading hyphal architecture and the nucleus [ 3 ] . Mounting evidence strongly suggests 56 that the complications associated with this increased distance are overcome by long - distance 57 intracellular communication for rapid and precise transduction of external information [ 4 ] . 58 Moreover , the maintenance of extremely polarized hyphal morphology is heavily dependent on 59 endosome trafficking . It is also important to maintain the structural and functional features of a 60 fungal cell [ 5 ] . 61 In the case of filamentous fungi , long - distance signaling is mediated by early endosomes ( EEs ) . 62 Besides signal sensing for motor - dependent retrograde signaling , EEs are involved in the 63 recycling of cell wall components , polarisomes and various receptors required for polarized tip 64 growth [ 6 ] . Loss of these functions leads to impaired host invasion and virulence [ 7 , 8 ] . The 65 generation of EEs , which are multipurpose carriers , is a key step in the endocytic pathway and 66 involves the cooperative action of membrane bending and cytoskeleton reorganization . 67 Membrane bending is the cornerstone for the generation of EEs and is regulated by proteins 68 involved in the detection and stabilization of membrane curvature [ 9 , 10 ] . 69 In animal cells , BAR domain superfamily proteins have been shown to integrate membrane 70 dynamics with cytoskeletal changes [ 11 ] . F - BAR domain proteins possess N - terminal α - helical 71 coiled - coil dimers and bind to negatively charged membranes via their positively charged 72 domain . This binding generates membrane curvature and regulates intracellular vesicle 73 trafficking [ 12 , 13 ] . Depending on the degree of curvature of the dimer , BAR membrane domain 74 superfamily proteins are broadly classified into three families : classical BAR domain , Fer / CIP4 75 homology BAR ( F - BAR ) domain and inverse BAR ( I - BAR ) domain proteins . The N - BAR and 76 F - BAR domains induce positive membrane curvature through concave lipid - binding interfaces 77 and trigger cell membrane invagination . However , I - BAR domains interact with shallow 78 negatively curved membranes through convex lipid - binding interfaces , leading to cell membrane 79 protrusion [ 14 ] . The pioneering work in the corn smut fungus , Ustilago maydis , revealed the 80 importance of endocytosis for the pathogenic development and virulence of the filamentous 81 fungi by showing impaired early pathogenicity and germination in endocytic mutants [ 15 ] . The 82 Cdc15 , an F - BAR protein , is involved in cytokinetic ring and septa formation in U . maydis [ 16 ] . 83 Recent studies in Magnaporthe oryzae revealed the importance of N - BAR domain - containing 84 proteins in the growth and virulence of filamentous fungi [ 17 ] . Further , the I - BAR protein , 85 Rvs167 , was found to be involved in the extension of the rigid penetration peg required during 86 M . oryzae invasion [ 18 ] . The F - BAR protein like Bzz1p in yeast and Cip4 in Drosophila a cts 87 during the early stages of endocytosis in the formation of actin patches [ 19 , 20 ] . It triggers actin 88 polymerization via the Arp2 / 3 complex [ 21 ] . There has been an intense study on the structural 89 and biochemical properties of BAR domain proteins that contribute to their mode of action . 90 However , there has been limited functional characterization of BAR superfamily proteins in 91 phytopathogenic fungi . 92 Ascochyta rabiei ( Pass . ) Labr . [ teleomorph Didymella rabiei ] , a causal agent of Ascochyta blight 93 ( AB ) disease in chickpea plants ( Cicer arietinum L . ) , is one of the most devastating necrotrophic 94 phytopathogens . A . rabiei infects the above - ground parts of this legume plant and greatly reduces 95 the yield of the crop [ 22 ] . The fungal hyphae aggregate in the cortical cells of the chickpea plant 96 and differentiate into asexual spores called pycnidia [ 23 , 24 ] . The genome of A . rabiei has been 97 sequenced and analyzed to identify pathogenic determinants [ 25 ] . A . rabiei has emerged as an 98 interesting model system for elucidating the cell biology , especially the endocytic machinery , 99 during polar growth and pathogenesis in necrotrophic phytopathogenic fungi . 100 In this study , a F - BAR domain - containing protein , ArF - BAR , was identified in A . rabiei . A loss 101 of function mutation of ArF - BAR caused a dramatic reduction in EEs , severely compromised 102 fungal pathogenesis and delayed septa formation . The results showed that the F - BAR domain of 103 the ArF - BAR protein binds to and deforms synthetic liposomes and generates membrane tubules . 104 ArF - BAR was induced in response to oxidative stress and infection , and localized to endocytic 105 vesicles within the fungal hyphae . It was also found that ArF - BAR expression was regulated by a 106 stress inducible transcription factor , ArCRZ1 . The data suggested that ArF - BAR - dependent 107 membrane remodeling combined with actin cytoskeleton dynamics at the fungal hyphal tip was 108 crucial for pathogenesis . 109 Results 110 ArF - BAR expression is induced in response to oxidative stress and infection 111 Transcriptome analysis of A . rabiei during oxidative stress has provided a greater understanding 112 of the survival strategies used by necrotrophic fungi against host - generated oxidative stress [ 26 ] . 113 The study by Singh et al . [ 26 ] revealed that 70 unigenes were upregulated under oxidative stress 114 conditions . Of these 70 unigenes , a clone resembling “ST47 _ g8005” of the sequenced A . rabiei 115 genome [ 27 ] , showed early upregulation against oxidative stress . The deduced amino acid 116 sequence of this gene revealed a protein with four distinct domains : an N - terminal F - BAR 117 domain , a unique protein kinase C1 domain , and two consecutive C - terminal SH3 domains ( Fig 118 1A ) . Henceforth , this protein has been named as ArF - BAR . Phylogenetic analysis of selected 119 pathogenic fungi and other eukaryotes revealed that ArF - BAR shared sequence identity with 120 proteins of many closely related phytopathogens ( S1 Fig ) . ArF - BAR was found to share 121 approximately 33 % and 41 % sequence identity with Saccharomyces cerevisae BZZ1p and 122 Drosophila melanogaster Cdc42 - Interacting Protein 4 ( CIP4 ) proteins , respectively ( S2 Fig ) . 123 To validate the results of the transcript profiling , quantitative real - time PCR ( qRT - PCR ) was 124 performed using primers specific to the F - BAR domain encoding region . The qRT - PCR 125 experiments revealed a higher expression level of the ArF - BAR transcript after a 1 h treatment of 126 menadione , which is an oxidative stress generator ( Fig 1B ) . To directly assess ArF - BAR 127 transcript induction during pathogenesis in a susceptible chickpea variety ( PUSA - 362 ) , the time 128 course of ArF - BAR transcript expression was measured following plant inoculation with conidial 129 suspension using qRT - PCR . Consistent with the previous observations , a significant increase in 130 the ArF - BAR transcript level was found following infection . The maximum transcript level was 131 at 24 hours post - infection ( hpi ; Fig 1C ) , which is within the critical time period for spores to 132 germinate on the host surface [ 27 ] . 133 ArF - BAR is a membrane tubulating protein 134 To understand whether ArF - BAR has a functional F - BAR domain , synthetic liposomes 135 containing Rhodamine B - conjugated PE were incubated with purified His - tagged recombinant 136 ArF - BAR protein ( S3A Fig ) . The spherical liposomes transformed into an intense network of 137 narrow tubules within 30 min of incubation ( Fig 1D and 1E ) . This indicated that ArF - BAR was 138 capable of robust liposome tubulation activity ( S3B Fig ) . Additionally , the sequence alignment 139 of the ArF - BAR , F - BAR domain with that of other F - BAR domain - containing proteins , revealed 140 the presence of positively charged conserved residues ( S2 Fig ) . Earlier , the positively charged 141 present in the F - BAR domains of CIP4 and Syndapin , have been shown to interact with 142 negatively charged phospholipids to induce membrane curvature [ 28 , 29 ] . Since ArF - BAR has 143 conserved positively charged amino acids at positions 57 , 58 , 131 and 132 ( S2 Fig ) , the role of 144 these residues in membrane deformation were evaluated . This evaluation was performed by 145 replacing the residues with glutamate ( K57E , K58E , R131E and K132E ) via site - directed 146 mutagenesis , and the mutant was referred to as ArF - BAR mut1 ( S3C Fig ) . Predictably , it was 147 found that substituting the conserved lysine / arginine with glutamate abolished the tubulation 148 activity of the F - BAR domain ( Fig 1F ) . Protein kinase C ( PKC ) proteins are diversely known to 149 interact with diacylglycerol ( DAG ) , which has a role in membrane interactions . To abolish the 150 involvement of the unique protein kinase C1 domain of ArF - BAR in membrane deformation , the 151 W428 and L430 residues were replaced with G428 and G430 , respectively [ 30 ] , and the mutant 152 form was referred to as ArF - BAR mut2 ( S3 D ) . Further , this mutated protein was used to assess the 153 liposome tubulation activity , and a similar activity to that of the native protein was found ( Fig 154 1G ) . To test whether the tubulation activity of ArF - BAR correlated with its lipid binding ability , 155 a liposome co - sedimentation assay was used ( Fig 1H ) . Compared to the native ArF - BAR protein , 156 ArF - BAR mut1 showed reduced lipid sedimentation efficiency . In contrast , the sedimentation was 157 unaffected with ArF - BAR mut2 . This indicated the importance of the direct interaction of the BAR 158 domain with the lipids in liposome tubulation ( Fig 1H ) . Together , these results suggest that the 159 F - BAR domain of ArF - BAR , along with its positively charged residues , plays a major role in 160 interacting with the lipid membrane for binding and deformation . 161 ArF - BAR is required for the virulence of A . rabiei in chickpea 162 To elucidate the biological importance of ArF - BAR in A . rabiei pathogenesis , an A . rabiei 163 knockout mutant that lacked the entire ArF - BAR gene was generated ( Δarf - bar ) . The ArF - BAR 164 gene was targeted for deletion using a homologous recombination approach . The results 165 confirmed that the open reading frame ( ORF ) of ArF - BAR had been successfully replaced with a 166 single copy of the hygromycin resistance gene ( Hph , S4A and S4B Fig ) . Simultaneously , Δarf - 167 bar mutant strain was complemented with a T - DNA cassette that expressed ArF - BAR under its 168 own promoter ( Δarf - bar / ArF - BAR , S4B and S5A Fig ) . 169 Notably , the knockout mutants showed reduced radial growth compared to wild - type A . rabiei 170 ( WT ) and this radial growth was restored in the Δarf - bar / ArF - BAR complementation mutant ( Fig 171 2A ) . To determine the virulence of the fungal strains , an in planta infection bioassay was 172 performed on a susceptible chickpea variety . Typical AB disease symptoms were observed on 173 plants challenged with the A . rabiei ( WT ) and Δarf - bar / ArF - BAR , but not on plants challenged 174 with Δarf - bar ( Fig 2B ) . The degree of pathogenicity was measured according to lesion number 175 and lesion size , which were compared among the A . rabiei ( WT ) and mutants at 144 hpi . The 176 lesion number per plant in Δarf - bar was significantly lower than in the A . rabiei ( WT , Fig 2C ) . 177 The mean lesion size was also much lower in Δarf - bar than in the A . rabiei ( WT , Fig 2d ) . 178 However , for the Δarf - bar / ArF - BAR complementation mutant , the disease symptoms were 179 comparable to those of the A . rabiei ( WT ) . Overall , the disruption of the ArF - BAR gene 180 significantly impaired the pathogenicity of A . rabiei . 181 To ascertain the role of the evolutionary conservation of the F - BAR and unique PKC domains in 182 contributing to fungal pathogenicity , the two domains were independently inactivated by site - 183 directed mutagenesis as described earlier . The Δarf - bar knockouts were complemented with 184 mutated ArF - BAR s encoding for mutated F - BAR ( Δarf - bar / ArF - BAR mut1 ) and PKC domains 185 ( Δarf - bar / ArF - BAR mut2 ; S4B , S5B and S5C Fig ) . The degree of pathogenicity in Δarf - bar / ArF - 186 BAR mut1 strain was lower than that of the WT . Meanwhile , in the case of Δarf - bar / ArF - BAR mut2 , 187 the number of lesions per plant was significantly lower than in the WT , but there was no 188 significant difference in the size of the lesions ( Fig 2B , 2C and 2D ) . The severity of the disease 189 symptoms increased in the plants after 10 days post infection ( dpi ) , but no significant differences 190 were observed for plants challenged with Δarf - bar ( S6 Fig ) . Together , these results confirm that 191 ArF - BAR is an important pathogenicity determinant and that the F - BAR domain is indispensable 192 for fungal pathogenesis . 193 It was subsequently hypothesized that the loss in pathogenicity of Δarf - bar could have resulted 194 from at least two factors : a ) knockout mutants of ArF - BAR may have had a compromised ability 195 to penetrate host tissue , or b ) the virulence phenotype of the mutant was a consequence of a 196 reduction in fungal viability . To address these possibilities , the depth of hyphal penetration in 197 chickpea leaves infected with the WT and Δarf - bar mutant strains were examined and compared . 198 The leaves of the chickpea plants challenged with the fungi were subjected to wheat germ 199 agglutinin ( WGA - 488 ) staining . At 48 hpi , the infected leaves were stained with WGA - 488 to 200 enable visualization of the fungus [ 30 ] . The infected leaves were optically sectioned using 201 confocal microscopy starting from the surface of the leaves . It was observed that hyphae of the 202 wild - type strain efficiently penetrated into the chickpea leaves up to depths of 20 . 25 µm ± 3 . 92 203 ( mean ± SD ; n = 3 ) . In stark contrast , the hyphae of the Δarf - bar mutant were unable to penetrate 204 beyond 9 . 83 µm ± 2 . 54 ( mean ± SD ; n = 3 , S7A and S7C Fig ) . Thus , the depth and efficiency of 205 hyphal penetration by Δarf - bar were significantly impaired ( S7B and S7C Fig ) . 206 Further , to investigate the direct involvement of ArF - BAR in fungal viability under oxidative 207 stress conditions , radial growth assays were performed for WT , Δarf - bar , Δarf - bar / ArF - BAR , 208 Δarf - bar / ArF - BAR mut1 and Δarf - bar / ArF - BAR mut2 strains . These strains were inoculated on either 209 potato dextrose agar ( PDA ) or PDA supplemented with menadione ( 250 µM and 500 µM ) or 210 H 2 O 2 ( 2 mM ) . The diameter of radial growth was analyzed at 10 dpi . The mycelial growth of 211 Δarf - bar was considerably reduced compared to that of the WT . The mycelial growth was 212 restored in the Δarf - bar / ArF - BAR and Δarf - bar / ArF - BAR mut2 mutants . However , the mycelial 213 growth of Δarf - bar / ArF - BAR mut1 was unable to match that of the WT . Exposure to oxidative 214 stress led to a greater growth inhibition rate in Δarf - bar than in the WT ( S8A and S8B Fig ) . The 215 involvement of ArF - BAR in oxidative stress tolerance was confirmed by the complementation 216 mutant , Δarf - bar / ArF - BAR , which showed similar resistance to the WT ( S8A and S8B Fig ) . 217 Further , exposure to oxidative stress led to greater growth inhibition in Δarf - bar / ArF - BAR mut1 218 than in the WT . However , the growth inhibition of Δarf - bar / ArF - BAR mut2 was similar to that of 219 WT . Consistent with the previous findings , these results strongly support the hypothesis that 220 ArF - BAR is a positive regulator of pathogenicity in A . rabiei and is required for the viability of 221 the fungus under stress conditions . 222 Absence of ArF - BAR delays septa formation 223 The next aim was to determine the subcellular localization of ArF - BAR . In this regard , an 224 enhanced yellow fluorescent protein ( EYFP ) was used to create the fusion protein , ArF - 225 BAR : : EYFP , which was transiently expressed in Δarf - bar . The bioimaging of the fluorescently 226 tagged ArF - BAR showed punctate distribution throughout the cytoplasm of the fungal hyphae . 227 The chimeric protein was mostly concentrated at the growing hyphal tip and at the septa ( Fig 3A 228 and 3B ) . Fungal hyphae transformed with chimeric ArF - BAR mut1 : : EYFP exhibited disrupted 229 localization of these punctate structures and the fluorescence was completely diffused throughout 230 the cytoplasm . However , the distribution of the fluorescent puncta was unaffected in hyphae 231 transiently expressing ArF - BAR mut2 : : EYFP . The punctate structures were distributed throughout 232 the cytoplasm and were prominently concentrated at the growing hyphal tip and septa ( Fig 3A ) . 233 Further , to validate the spatiotemporal distribution pattern of the ArF - BAR protein during 234 infection , fungal spores expressing ArF - BAR : : EYFP were allowed to infect susceptible chickpea 235 leaves . Microscopic observation of these hyphae infected chickpea leaves revealed a distribution 236 pattern that was similar to that of the ArF - BAR : : EYFP expressing hyphae growing on glass 237 slides ; the chimeric protein was predominantly distributed at the hyphal tip and septa ( S9 Fig ) . 238 The arrangement of septa within the fungal hyphae of both the WT and the Δarf - bar strain were 239 examined . Microscopic analysis of the Δarf - bar mutant using calcofluor white , which precisely 240 stains cell wall components , showed that the filaments lacked regularly spaced septa . 241 Interestingly , the distance of the first septum from the growing hyphal tip ( polarized end ) was 242 significantly greater in the Δarf - bar mutant ( 58 . 5µm ± 4 . 65 ; mean ± SEM ) than in the WT 243 ( 23 . 5µm ± 3 . 23 ; mean ± SEM ; Fig 3C and3D ) . Overall , these results reveal that the ArF - BAR 244 gene is necessary for appropriate fungal architecture , which is , in turn , important for host 245 penetration and virulence . 246 ArF - BAR mediates early endosome biogenesis and endocytosis 247 Since F - BAR domain proteins are known to form a canonical banana - shaped fold and to 248 dimerize [ 31 ] , the dimerization of ArF - BAR was confirmed using a yeast two - hybrid ( Y2H ) 249 system . This evidence indicated the evolutionarily conserved nature of the BAR protein function 250 ( S10A Fig ) . To further gain insights of ArF - BAR in endocytosis an endocytic tracer dye , N - ( 3 - 251 triethylammoniumpropyl ) - 4 - ( p - diethyl - aminophenyl - hexatrienyl ) pyridiniumdi bromide ( FM4 - 252 64 ) , was used [ 32 ] . Both WT and Δarf - bar were stained , and the microscopic analysis revealed 253 visible internal staining of the hyphae . The results suggested that in WT - hyphae , the dye was 254 rapidly internalized . In contrast , in Δarf - bar strain , no such obvious internalization was observed , 255 even after 10 – 15 min of FM4 - 64 incubation ( Fig 4A ) . To quantify these findings , the mean 256 fluorescence intensity was determined ( Fig 4A ) . The results provided evidence for the 257 involvement of ArF - BAR in the endocytic mechanism . 258 The central components of the endocytic pathway are the EEs , where the small GTPase Rab5 259 plays a major regulatory role in biogenesis [ 33 ] . ArRab5 , an orthologue of Rab5 , was identified 260 in the A . rabiei through NCBI blast search , against Rab5 of M . oryzae , and U . maydis . The 261 relationship between ArF - BAR - associated endocytosis and ArRab5 - associated early endosomes 262 was determined using a double - labeling experiment . ArF - BAR was tagged with mCherry and 263 ArRab5 with EGFP . This was followed by sequential transformation into the WT . The 264 coalescence of fluorescence obtained showed perfect positive correlation between the two fusion 265 proteins ( Fig 4B ) . 266 Early endosomes mature to late endosomes followed by the replacement of Rab5 to Rab7 [ 34 ] . 267 Thus , we aimed to determine whether the punctate distribution of ArF - BAR was associated with 268 all endocytic vesicles or specifically to the EEs . In this context , similar to Rab5 orthologue , an 269 orthologue of Rab7 was identified in A . rabiei , and was tagged with EYFP ( ArRab7 : EYFP ) . A 270 similar double - labeling experiment was performed that showed that least correlation between the 271 ArF - BAR : : mCherry and ArRab7 : : EYFP fusion proteins ( S10B Fig ) . In summary , these results 272 uncover a novel role of ArF - BAR proteins ; they specifically bind to early endocytic vesicles , 273 regulate the biogenesis of EEs , and mediate their motility during endocytosis . 274 ArF - BAR modulates the actin cytoskeleton 275 The presence of SH3 ( SRC homology 3 ) domains in F - BAR proteins is well documented for 276 their relationship with the actin cytoskeleton via interactions with the Arp2 / 3 complex activator 277 Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASp ) [ 35 ] . Since ArF - BAR in A . rabiei , contains two 278 consecutive SH3 domain at its C - terminus , we initially hypothesized for the probable existence 279 of interactions of ArF - BAR with that of ArActin . Using Y2H system , it was shown that ArF - 280 BAR does not interact directly with actin ( Fig 5A ) , rather it physically interacts with WASp 281 through its SH3 domain ( 572 - 760 amino acids ; Fig 5B , S11A and S11B Fig ) . Further , to check 282 the role of ArF - BAR in actin polymerization , a well - established in vitro actin polymerization 283 assay was performed . The kinetics of actin polymerization was monitored by the increase in the 284 fluorescence of pyrene - labeled actin . The effect of purified ArF - BAR protein on actin nucleation 285 ( actin , Arp2 / 3 and WASp ) was tested using a minimal set of components for all reactions . 286 Interestingly , the addition of purified recombinant protein led to an increase in the actin 287 polymerization rate ( Fig 5C ) . By increasing the concentration of purified protein , a significant 288 gradual activation in the rate of actin polymerization was observed ( Fig 5C ) . These results 289 strongly suggest that ArF - BAR plays an active role in WASp - dependent actin polymerization . 290 Appropriate organization of actin is required for vesicular dynamics , organelle movement and 291 cytokinesis . Actin microfilaments or F - actin are organized into higher order structures 292 comprising of actin patches , cables and rings that serve as the track for long distance transport 293 [ 36 ] . To elucidate the relative importance of ArF - Bar in actin organization the actin dynamics 294 were compared in the WT and Δarf - bar mutants . Here , we took advantage of LifeAct , an actin 295 binding peptide fused with a fluorescence protein . LifeAct has been successfully employed for in 296 vivo visualization of actin filaments and dynamics in a variety of organisms including fungi and 297 plants [ 37 ] . In this study , a LifeAct : mCherry fusion construct was generated and transformed into 298 both the WT and Δarf - bar mutants to visualize cytoplasmic actin in the fungal hyphae . Confocal 299 microscopy revealed discrete actin patches , and cables in the WT hyphae ( Fig 5D ) . In contrast , 300 the actin patches were rarely visible in the Δarf - bar mutant ( Fig 5D and 5E ) . Moreover , the actin 301 cables were dramatically disorganized in the Δarf - bar mutant . Although ArF - BAR does not 302 directly interact with actin , it regulates actin polymerization and the actin cytoskeleton through 303 its association with WASp in the growing fungal hyphae . 304 ArCRZ1 is a potential transcriptional regulator of ArF - BAR 305 Thus far , the findings of the present study have revealed the importance of ArF - BAR in the 306 regulation of endocytic pathways , which is crucial for the pathogenesis of A . rabiei . However , 307 the transcriptional regulatory machinery associated with the endocytic pathway in filamentous 308 pathogenic fungi is largely unknown . Hence , the transcriptional mechanism associated with the 309 regulation of ArF - BAR in response to infection was subsequently analyzed . Binding motifs for 310 fungal transcription factors ( TFs ) were identified in the upstream regulatory sequences of ArF - 311 BAR . Seven different putative TF binding sites were identified ( S1 Table ) . Among these , three 312 binding sites , positioned at - 106 , - 136 , and - 254 upstream of the ArF - BAR promoter , were found 313 for calcineurin - responsive zinc finger transcription factor 1 ( CRZ1 ; Fig 6A ) . 314 CRZ1 is an evolutionarily conserved TF from yeast to mammals . CRZ1 was chosen for analysis 315 because it regulates the expression of various genes involved in stress tolerance [ 38 ] and is 316 widely known to translocate inside the nucleus with an increase in cytosolic Ca 2 + ion 317 concentration . CRZ1 of A . rabiei ( ArCRZ1 ; ST47 _ g3738 ) possesses a serine - rich region ( SRR ) , 318 two consecutive calcineurin docking domains ( CDD ) , characterized by PxlxlT motif ( PRlLPQ 319 and PElNlD ) and a single C 2 H 2 zinc finger motif ( S12A Fig ) . To determine the role of ArCRZ1 320 in the transcriptional regulation of ArF - BAR , the binding of ArCRZ1 to the regulatory sequences 321 of ArF - BAR was confirmed . This confirmation was performed via an electrophoretic mobility 322 shift assay ( EMSA ) using recombinant His - tagged ArCRZ1 proteins . Shifting was observed for 323 the DNA fragment possessing the calcineurin - dependent response element ( CDRE ) in the 324 presence of purified His - ArCRZ1 . However , mutations in this CDRE resulted in the abolishment 325 of binding ( Fig 6B and 6C ) . 326 Subsequently , the sub - cellular localization of ArCRZ1 under Ca 2 + and oxidative stress conditions 327 was determined . The WT was transformed with a translational fusion of ArCRZ1 with EYFP 328 towards C - terminus . Confocal microscopy revealed the elegantly concentrated nuclear 329 localization of the ArCRZ1 : : EYFP signal under stress conditions ( Fig 6D ) . Interestingly , the 330 ArCRZ1 : : EYFP fusion protein was uniformly distributed within the cytoplasm in the absence of 331 these stresses ( Fig 6D ) . Since , the nuclear translocation of ArCRZ1 is mediated by a phosphatase 332 ( calcineurin ) , a chemical genetics approach was used to confirm the relationship between 333 calcineurin and ArCRZ1 . Here , the immunosuppressant FK506 , which is a potent calcineurin 334 inhibitor [ 39 ] , was used to silence the enzymatic activity of calcineurin . FK506 potentially 335 inhibited nuclear translocation of ArCRZ1 : : EYFP , which indicates that calcineurin plays a role 336 in the nuclear translocation of ArCRZ1 under stress conditions ( Fig 6D ) . 337 To corroborate and extend these findings during infection , susceptible plants were challenged 338 with fungal conidia expressing ArCRZ1 : : EYFP , and nuclear localization of EYFP was observed 339 ( S12B and S12C Fig ) . Overall , these results confirm the evolutionarily conserved signaling of 340 calcineurin - dependent ArCRZ1 under oxidative stress conditions . 341 To uncover the functional regulation of the ArF - BAR gene mediated by ArCRZ1 , a targeted 342 deletion of the ArCRZ1 gene was generated ( Δarcrz1 ) , followed by complementation 343 with ArCRZ1 controlled by its own promoter ( Δarcrz1 / ArCRZ1 ; S12C - S12E Fig ) . Interestingly , 344 no significant difference in radial growth diameter was observed between Δarcrz1 and the WT 345 ( Fig 7A ) . The expression pattern of ArF - BAR in the WT and Δarcrz1 was analyzed using semi - 346 quantitative RT - PCR . The results clearly showed significant reduction in ArF - BAR gene 347 expression in the Δarcrz1 mutant . Imposing oxidative stress to both the WT and the Δarcrz1 348 mutant via menadione treatment revealed an upregulation of the ArF - BAR transcript in the WT . 349 This upregulation was found to be completely abolished in the Δarcrz1 mutant ( Fig 7B ) . Overall , 350 these results substantiate that the novel transcriptional regulation of ArF - BAR expression is 351 mediated by the TF ArCRZ1 under oxidative stress conditions . 352 Loss - of - function of ArCRZ1 compromises pathogenicity similar to Δarf - bar 353 As ArCRZ1 transcriptionally regulates the expression of ArF - BAR , it was hypothesized that the 354 pathogenicity phenotypes of Δarcrz1 should be similar to those of the Δarf - bar mutants . 355 Consistent with this hypothesis , it was observed that Δarcrz1 mutants displayed compromised 356 pathogenicity during an in planta infection bioassay . The number and size of legions were lower 357 in the Δarcrz1 mutant than in the WT . This pathogenicity defect was rescued in Δarcrz1 / ArCRZ1 358 ( Fig 7C – 7E ) . The radial growth patterns of Δarcrz1 mutants grown on PDA supplemented with 359 Ca 2 + , menadione and sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) were also monitored . Under these tested 360 stress conditions , the growth inhibition was significantly greater for Δarcrz1 than for WT . 361 However , the growth phenotype was restored in the Δarcrz1 / ArCRZ1 strain , which suggests 362 that ArCRZ1 plays a crucial role in calcium ion signaling , oxidative stress response and 363 maintaining cell - wall integrity during infection ( S13 and S14 Fig ) . Taken together , these results 364 demonstrate that ArCRZ1 is a key regulator of the endocytic process . ArCRZ1 induces the 365 expression of ArF - BAR by directly binding to its gene promoter region and is critical for ArF - 366 BAR - dependent pathogenesis . 367 Discussion 368 Dynamic membrane remodeling is essential for maintaining the integrity and identity of cells and 369 cellular compartments [ 40 ] . Biological macromolecules , such as BAR superfamily proteins , can 370 sense or induce membrane curvature . They are well - known modulators of transient membrane 371 deformation [ 39 ] . Emerging evidence strongly suggests that EEs are crucial for long - distance 372 intracellular communication . Thus , EEs and their roles have broad implications for a wealth of 373 cellular processes such as growth , development , and virulence in filamentous fungi [ 4 , 41 , 15 ] . 374 The results of the present study further corroborate this conclusion and provide new information 375 regarding signaling and transcriptional control of F - BAR proteins in phytopathogenic fungi . To 376 date , our understanding of the role played by F - BAR proteins in membrane curvature generation 377 and efficient long - range endosome trafficking in fungi during plant - pathogen interactions 378 remains very limited . 379 This study unravels the intrinsic mechanism of EE formation in phytopathogenic fungi during 380 polarized hyphal tip growth and host - penetration . To the best of our knowledge , this study 381 provides the first evidence that an F - BAR domain protein can act as a key mandate for 382 pathogenicity . In phytopathogenic fungi , Ar F - BAR navigates endosome trafficking via the 383 coordinated action of cell membrane remodeling and actin reorganization . The present findings 384 suggest a model in which Ar F - BAR modulates the invagination step and recruits the apical 385 plasma membrane for EE formation during filamentous growth and host penetration of A . rabiei . 386 Based on the evidences provided in the present study , we propose that Ar F - BAR performs two 387 different but well - coordinated functions that result in EE formation during A . rabiei hyphal 388 growth ( Fig 8 ) . 389 Previous studies , largely conducted in animal models , have highlighted that the F - BAR domain 390 is a membrane - deforming module and is involved in endocytosis [ 42 , 29 ] . The endocytic event is 391 crucial for the uptake of signal cues and nutrition from the host , and aids apical recycling of 392 membrane receptors and proteins . This process thus helps to maintain the overall polarity of the 393 hyphae that is required for fungal growth and virulence [ 6 , 38 ] . The generation of EEs and their 394 trafficking involves microtubule dynamics , actin cytoskeleton rearrangements and most 395 importantly , extensive membrane remodeling [ 43 ] . Actin dynamics and microtubule organization 396 have been extensively studied . However , the detailed mechanism underlying the functional 397 regulation of fungal EE biogenesis and EE trafficking at the hyphal tip during plant pathogenesis 398 remains poorly understood . 399 The present study identifies an unprecedented role for the ArF - BAR protein as an essential 400 component of endocytosis that positively regulates EE biogenesis . Unveiling other networks 401 associated with this system , ArF - BAR in coordination with Arp2 / 3 - WASp , was found to mediate 402 actin cytoskeleton assembly at the hyphal tip . The Arp2 / 3 - WASp assembly is a prerequisite for 403 host penetration [ 44 , 45 ] . The distribution of the F - actin network , which serves as the molecular 404 track for endosome trafficking [ 8 , 35 ] , was disorganized in the Δarf - bar mutant , affecting 405 endocytic transport . This phenomenon would explain why the loss of the ArF - BAR function 406 leads to the attenuation of virulence compared to WT . This loss in virulence is similar to that 407 observed in the rice blast fungus M . oryzae and U . maydis where endocytosis is crucial for the 408 recognition of host partners during the early stages of pathogenic development [ 7 ] . Therefore , we 409 conclude that ArF - BAR proteins act as membrane - bound tethers to properly recruit the apical 410 plasma membrane for EE formation during endosome trafficking in A . rabiei . 411 During host - pathogen interactions , the key to successful pathogenesis is to overcome the rigid 412 defense responses of the host . Collectively , the first challenge the pathogen encounters is an 413 oxidative burst at the site of infection , which initiates various signaling cascades in the pathogen 414 that aid its survival . Calcium , an essential secondary messenger , mediates one such signaling 415 cascade [ 46 ] . In response to stimuli , the cytosolic Ca 2 + concentration increases [ 47 ] and 416 modulates various Ca 2 + - binding proteins such as calmodulin . The Ca 2 + and calmodulin complex 417 activates calcineurin . In many eukaryotes , calcineurin is known to regulate the activity of CRZ1 , 418 which is usually localized in the cytosol in phosphorylated form . Upon activation , CRZ1 gets 419 relocated to the nucleus . In pathogenic fungi , many of the CRZ1 - dependent targets , such as those 420 involved in the maintenance of cell wall integrity , thermo - tolerance , cation homeostasis , azole 421 tolerance and hyphal growth have been identified [ 39 ] . However , in the present study ArF - BAR 422 was identified as a novel ArCRZ1target . The identification of ArF - BAR as a target improves our 423 understanding of the novel regulatory mechanism of endocytosis in filamentous fungi , where 424 ArF - BAR functions downstream of ArCRZ1 . 425 The development of septa is an important event during hyphal differentiation that is required for 426 the formation of sexual structures and asexual spores [ 48 ] . Septation is comparable to cytokinesis 427 that additionally includes cell separation . A cascade of events is involved in septum biogenesis , 428 which includes assembly of the contractile actomyosin ring ( CAR ) , plasma membrane ingression 429 and cell wall constriction [ 49 ] . In fission yeast , Cdc15 and Imp2 , and in budding yeast , Hof1 are 430 the major F - BAR domain - containing proteins implicated in the formation of the CAR , and the 431 primary and secondary septa during cytokinesis [ 50 , 51 ] . Additionally , Cdc15 of U . maydis also 432 implicated for similar phenotype [ 16 ] . Therefore , the localization of ArF - BAR along the septum 433 ring indicates that endocytosis is one of the pathways responsible for regulating the development 434 of the septa . Septation is initiated at the definitive size of the hyphae [ 52 ] . With the initial 435 recognition and establishment of disease in the host , the pathogen needs to proliferate at an 436 enormously increased rate . Therefore , maintaining proper hyphal architecture and polarity is 437 fundamental for pathogenesis that demands rapid coordinated internalization and recycling 438 events [ 53 ] . The fungal mutant Δarf - bar , deficient in ArF - BAR protein , displayed a delay in 439 septum formation and displayed decreased virulence in the absence of proper hyphal structure . 440 In silico analysis of F - BAR proteins from various filamentous fungi , revealed the evolution of 441 the conserved protein kinase C1 domain . The PKC proteins are phospholipid - and DAG - 442 dependent kinases involved in various intracellular signaling cascades . Fungal PKC has a 443 serine / threonine kinase domain . In Saccharomy cescerevisae and S . pombe , the PKC is known to 444 activate MAP kinase signaling that helps in cell wall damage repair and in C . albicans , PKC 445 helps to provide osmotic tolerance [ 54 ] . Preliminary studies from other filamentous pathogens , 446 such as Aspergillus fumigates and Neurosspora crassa , suggest the involvement of PKC proteins 447 in cellular integrity maintenance . PKC family members have three regulatory domains C1 , C2 448 and HR1 , where the C1 domain of classic PKC enzymes has the ability to bind to DAG and 449 phorbol esters [ 55 ] . Studies have reported the presence of two different cysteine - rich ( C1 ) 450 motifs , C1A and C1B , termed as “typical” and “atypical , ” respectively , depending on whether 451 they “do” or “do not” bind to DAG and phorbol esters [ 57 ] . Interestingly , the presence of a 452 specific C1 domain provides uniqueness to the F - BAR protein of filamentous fungi . However , in 453 the current study , the targeted mutation of this domain did not have any functional relevance for 454 virulence . This lack of relevance may have been for two reasons ; a ) C1 might be present in an 455 “atypical” form or b ) the lack of the C2 domain in ArF - BAR ; both the C1 and C2 domains are 456 required for full - enzymatic activation of PKC [ 58 ] . 457 In summary , we propose that the ArF - BAR protein of A . rabiei has the potential to interactively 458 affect the hyphal growth and pathogenic developmental trajectories of filamentous fungi . This 459 evolving model provides mechanistic insight into the role of a membrane scaffolding protein in 460 the process of endosome trafficking in fungal pathogenesis . In turn , this provides many 461 additional potential targets for the development of effective and durable strategies to control AB 462 fungal disease . Therefore , the observations of the present study in context to the intracellular 463 trafficking , during the early stages of plant - pathogen interactions , have broad relevance for 464 shaping disease - control strategies . These findings may also be helpful for the disease control of 465 animal - infecting fungal pathogens such as A . fumigatus and C . albicans . Thus , further studies 466 will be directed to characterize the interacting partners influenced by ArF - BAR during endosome 467 formation . A diverse spectrum of studies has revealed the existence of two parallel independent 468 endocytic mechanisms : a ) clathrin - mediated and b ) clathrin - independent [ 59 ] . Similarly , 469 extensive studies will be required to fully elucidate the ArF - BAR - mediated endocytic 470 mechanism . Such studies would help us to understand the complex interplay underlying the 471 endosome formation required for fungal virulence . Further , the understanding of its regulatory 472 mechanism would help in scrutinizing the molecular and cellular basis of disease development , 473 which would subsequently help develop disease - control strategies for filamentous fungi . 474 Methods 475 Fungal strains and growth conditions 476 A virulent isolate of Ascochyta rabiei ( ArD2 ; ITCC No . 4638 ) was procured from IARI , New 477 Delhi . The single spore culture of this mating type 2 isolate was generated and maintained as 478 wild type fungi for research work . The WT and its derivative fungal strains ( S2 Table ) were 479 maintained on potato dextrose agar ( PDA ; Difco Laboratories , pH 5 . 2 - 5 . 5 ) at 22ºC for 10 - 15 480 days to assess the growth pattern and colony characteristics [ 26 ] . The fungus was routinely 481 subcultured on the PDA plate supplemented with chickpea extract to maintain virulence . To 482 determine the vegetative growth pattern of fungal mycelia in response to oxidative stress , PDA 483 plate supplemented with menadione ( 250 µM and 500 µM ; Sigma - Aldrich , USA ) and H 2 O 2 ( 2 484 mM ; Sigma - Aldrich , USA ) were used . The conidial suspensions of 10 µl ( 1x10 3 conidia / ml ) 485 were inoculated at the center of PDA plate for growth assay . After 10 days of incubation under 486 optimum condition , the diameters of fungal colonies were measured using ImageJ software . 487 Three independent biological experiments were performed with three technical replicate each 488 time . 489 RNA extraction and expression analysis 490 Total RNA was extracted from 5 - 6 days old fungal mycelia grown in potato dextrose broth 491 ( PDB ; Difco Laboratories , USA ) or from plant tissues inoculated with WT using TRIzol reagent 492 ( Invitrogen , USA ) . The isolated total RNA was subjected to DNase1 ( Promega , USA ) treatment 493 and subsequently used for first - strand cDNA synthesis using SuperScript IV reverse transcriptase 494 ( ThermoFisher Scientific ) . Targeted gene expression was determined by qRT - PCR with 495 ABI7900 ( Applied Biosystems , USA ) , using SYBR Green PCR master mix ( Applied 496 Biosystems , USA ) . Relative expression of fungal genes was calculated after normalized with 497 elongation factor α ( ArEFα ; ST47 _ g4052 ) using 2 - ΔΔct method [ 60 ] . The data were analysed from 498 three biological replicates each having three technical replicates . 499 Site - directed mutagenesis 500 The mutations at requisite sites of ArF - BAR were achieved by PCR amplification of 501 pET28a ( + ) : ArF - BAR clone with pre - designed primers containing mutations of interest . 502 Mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange II Site - directed mutagenesis kit ( Agilent , 503 USA ) . Web - based Quik Change Primer Design tool ( www . agilent . com / genomics / qcpd ) was used 504 to design primers . The presence of mutations in clones was confirmed by Sanger sequencing . 505 Targeted gene knockout and complementation in A . rabiei 506 Homologous gene replacement with hph cassette strategy was used to generate knockout ( KO ) 507 constructs for A . rabiei genes . Genomic DNA was isolated from 5 - day grown PDB culture of A . 508 rabiei using GenElute TM Plant Genomic DNA miniprep kit ( Sigma - Aldrich , USA ) . The 5  509 flanking genomic sequences of ArF - BAR were amplified from A . rabiei genomic DNA using 510 primer pairs of ArF - BARKOif5F and ArF - BARKOif5R while the 3  flanking sequences were 511 amplified using Ar72KO3 and Ar72KO4 ( S3 Table ) . These amplified 5  and 3  flanking 512 sequences were cloned sequentially into pGKO2 vector at Kpn I / Pst I and Bam HI / Eco RI sites , 513 respectively . The cloned ArF - BAR gene replacement cassette of ~ 3 . 4 kb , including 5  and 3  514 flanking sequence along with hph , was amplified using primer pair ArF - BARKOif5F and 515 Ar72KO4 , and transformed into A . rabiei protoplasts . The A . rabiei protoplast transfection was 516 performed as described earlier [ 61 ] . , with some minor modifications . The putative transformants 517 were selected on a PDA plate supplemented with 50 µg / µl hygromycin . To generate the 518 complementation constructs of ArF - BAR and its mutated ( mut1 and mut2 ) versions , about 4 . 4 kb 519 DNA fragment having the native promoter , ORF region , and TrpC terminator was amplified and 520 cloned into pBIF2 vector ( Bacterial selection - kanamycin ; Fungal selection - G418 ) at Eco RI and 521 Hind III sites . These three constructs of ArF - BAR were independently transformed into Δarf - bar 522 mutant strain by ATMT [ 27 ] . Similarly , A . rabiei ArCRZ1 gene knockout mutant and 523 complementation strains were developed . 524 Gene knockout confirmation by PCR and Southern blot 525 The single spore culture of putative KOs selected on hygromycin was initially screened by 526 genomic PCR . A primer set binding at position 5  to the homologous recombination region and 527 TrpC promoter was used for gene upstream region while a primer set binding at Hph gene and 528 position 3  to the homologous recombination region was used for gene downstream integrity 529 check ( S3 Table ) . The complemented strains single spore culture was also confirmed by genomic 530 PCR . The PCR positive Δarf - bar , and Δarcrz1 mutants ( KOs ) and complemented strains were 531 further verified by Southern blot . The genomic DNA of WT , Δarf - bar and Δarcrz1 mutants was 532 digested with Eco RI enzyme while genomic DNA was digested with Eco RI and Hind III for the 533 complemented mutant strains ( Δarf - bar / ArF - BAR , Δarf - bar / ArF - BAR mut1 , Δarf - bar / ArF - BAR mut2 , 534 and Δarcrz1 / ArCRZ1 ) . The digested DNA was separated along with λ DNA / Hind III marker 535 ( ThermoFisher Scientific ) and blotted to a membrane followed by hybridization with radioactive 536 probe [ 62 ] prepared using the random primers labelingNEBlot ® kit ( New England Biolabs , 537 USA ) . The band detection was carried out using Typhoon ® phosphor imager ( GE Healthcare , 538 USA ) . 539 Pathogenicity assay 540 Two - week - old susceptible chickpea ( Pusa 362 ) plants grown in plant growth chambers under 541 controlled conditions ( D / N temperature : 24ºC / 18ºC ; Relative Humidity : 80 % ; light intensity 250 542 µE / m 2 / s ; D / N light duration : 14 / 10 h ) were used for infection assays . Conidial suspensions of A . 543 rabiei strains were collected separately from a 20 - days - old PDA plate grown culture . Two - 544 weeks - old plants were spray inoculated with conidial suspensions diluted to 2x10 6 conidia / ml . 545 Plants were again kept under optimum conditions . Disease lesions were examined 5 - 7 days after 546 spray inoculation . 547 In vitro Protein purification 548 Respective cDNAs were cloned in pET28a ( + ) and transformed into E . coli BL21 - CodonPlus 549 ( DE3 ) - RIPL cells . The protein expression was induced with 0 . 5 mM Isopropyl β - D - 550 thiogalactoside ( IPTG ) for 6 h at 23ºC . Bacterial pellet was lysed in buffer [ 500 mMNaCl , 50 551 mM NaPO 4 ( pH 8 . 0 ) , 10 mM Imidazole , 1mM β - Mercaptoethanol , 1 mg / ml lysozyme and 1mM 552 Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride ( PMSF ) ] by incubating 30 min on ice , followed by sonication . 553 The cell lysates were precipitated followed by 0 . 45 µm filtration . The cleared lysate was 554 incubated with Ni - NTA resin for 30 min at 4ºC . The His - tagged fusion protein was purified 555 using a Ni - NTA column ( Bio - Rad , USA ) . Protein was eluted in elution buffer [ 500 mMNaCl , 50 556 mM NaPO 4 ( pH 8 . 0 ) , 10 % glycerol and 200 mM imidazole ] . The quality and quantity of eluted 557 protein were checked by SDS / PAGE and Bradford assay , respectively . The proteins were 558 dialyzed in respective compatible buffers followed by concentration . 559 Liposome preparation and Tubulation assay 560 Liposomes were prepared as described previously [ 63 ] using 70 % Phosphatidylethanolamine 561 ( POPE ) , 20 % Phosphatidylcholine ( POPC ) , and 10 % Rhodamine B - conjugated PE ( Echelon 562 Biosciences , USA ) . In an amber vial , all the lipids were initially dissolved in chloroform : 563 methanol ( 65 : 35 ; v / v ) mixture and vial were kept under liquid nitrogen for 10 min before being 564 immediately subjected to vacuum desiccation / lyophilisation for 2 h at 60 mTorr . The lipids were 565 hydrated with buffer [ 25mM Tris - HCl ( pH 6 . 8 ) and 100mM NaCl ] and subjected to three freeze - 566 thaw cycles of 5 min each at 68 ºC and liquid nitrogen . Extrusion was performed at 68 ºC on a 567 pre - heated mini extruder ( Avanti Polar Lipids , USA ) . The prepared liposomes were diluted as 568 desired and immediately proceeded for tubulation assay . Before use , the purified proteins were 569 subjected to 100 , 000 g centrifugation for 20 min at 4 ºC to remove the aggregate proteins . To 570 examine tubule formation , the mixed liposome and protein samples were analysed in Lumox ® 24 - 571 well plate ( Millipore , USA ) by live - cell imaging on Axio Examiner . Z1 ( Zeiss microscope ) . 572 Actin polymerization assay 573 The actin polymerization modulation activity of the proteins was checked using Actin 574 Polymerization Biochem Kit ( Cytoskeleton , USA ) , using the manufacturer’s instruction . Freshly 575 solubilized components ; 13 nM Arp2 / 3 protein complex and 15 nMWASp - VCA domain - GST 576 purified ( Cytoskeleton , USA ) along with freshly purified ArF - BAR protein in concentrations of 577 200 , 400 and 600 nM were used . The reaction was carried in an opaque 96 - well plate and kept in 578 the dark . The actin polymerization rate was recorded by monitoring the pyrene fluorescence 579 signals using CLARIO ® star plate reader ( BMG Labtech , Germany ) with the following settings ; 580 slow kinetics , 60 sec interval ,  ex = 360±15 nm and  em = 420±20 nm . 581 Liposome co - sedimentation assay 582 The purified fusion proteins were pre - centrifuged , before the assay , at 100 , 000 g for 15 min to 583 remove protein aggregates . Protein from the supernatant was mixed with freshly prepared 584 synthetic liposomes with gentle tapping . Ultracentrifugation was performed at 100 , 000 g for 15 585 min at 4ºC and the supernatant and the pellet were carefully separated . The supernatant was 586 mixed with 1 : 1 loading buffer while the pellet was re - suspended in 2x loading buffer . Samples 587 were analysed on Coomassie stained SDS - PAGE . 588 589 Yeast two - hybrid assays 590 The interactions of various combinations between ArF - BAR , ArActin , ArWASP , and ArF - BAR 591 domains in yeast cytoplasm were examined using the split - ubiquitin based DUALhunter system 592 ( Dualsystems Biotech ) . The ORFs were cloned at Not I and Asc I restriction sites or by LR 593 clonase II into pGDHB1 and pGPR3 - N vectors . The cloned plasmids were co - transformed along 594 with necessary controls into NMY51 strain using the EZ ‐ Yeast transformation kit ( MP 595 Biomedicals , USA ) and plated on SD ‐ L / ‐ W plates . The plating of yeast clones on required 596 synthetic media to check protein - protein interactions in yeast was done as described previously 597 [ 22 ] . All the interactions were verified by three independent experiments . 598 599 Electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) 600 His - tagged ArCRZ1 ( His - ArCRZ1 ) expression construct was developed and recombinant protein 601 was purified . The wild type and mutated CDRE DNA fragments were assembled by annealing 602 oligonucleotide pairs in a thermal cycler by heating at 95º C for 5 min followed by cooling at RT 603 for 15 min . End labelling of DNA fragments was performed by [ γ 32 P ] dATP BRIT , India ) , and 604 Polynucleotide Kinase ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , USA ) . Additionally , for competition assays , 605 two complementary oligonucleotides were annealed at equimolar concentration . Purified His - 606 ArCRZ1 protein was incubated with 10 ng of labelled DNA fragment in the presence of 1 mg of 607 poly - deoxy - inosinic - deoxy - cytidylic acid [ poly ( dI - dC ) ] and 1X binding buffer ( 15mM HEPES 608 ( pH 7 . 6 ) , 0 . 2 mM MgCl 2 , 35 mMKCl , 1 mM DTT and 1 % glycerol ) in a reaction volume of 30 609 µl for 25 min at room temperature . DNA loading dye was used to terminate the reaction . The 610 competitive assays were performed using 50 , 100 and 200 times of specific fragments in excess . 611 To identify the relative binding , the complexes were resolved on 6 % native PAGE , dried , and 612 autoradiographed on X - ray films . 613 614 Microscopic methods 615 Sample preparation for microscopic analysis 616 The conidia from the respective fungal strains were harvested in 1 ml sterile distilled water from 617 15 - day - old fungal mycelia grown on PDA plates . The conidial suspension was filtered through 618 Mira cloth . Ten microlitres ( 1×10 6 conidia / ml ) of suspension was kept on a sterile glass coverslip 619 and allowed to grow under the optimal condition for 24 h in dark . To investigate the localization 620 of chimeric proteins in fungal hyphae , growing on chickpea stem peel , the conidia were allowed 621 to grow for 36 h under optimum conditions of infection . The grown hyphae samples were then 622 used for confocal laser scanning microscopy . 623 624 Confocal laser scanning microscopy 625 For microscopic studies , TCS SP5 and TCS SP8 confocal laser scanning microscope ( Leica 626 Microsystems , Germany ) were used . For subcellular localization , the conidia were harvested 627 from transgenic fungal strains expressing fluorescent - tagged proteins . The Z - stacked images 628 with 1 µm step size were acquired using a high - resolution CCD camera . For calcofluor - white 629 ( CW ) , the hyphae grown on the glass slide were incubated for 10 min in the CW solution 630 ( Sigma - Aldrich , USA ) . After incubation , the stained hyphae were rinsed with PBS ( pH 7 . 4 ) 631 followed by rinsing with sterile distilled water , before image acquisition . For FM4 - 64 uptake , 1 632 ml of harvested conidial suspension was centrifuged at 2 , 500 g , washed twice with sterile 633 distilled water and then allowed to germinate on glass slides . The aqueous solution ( 10 µM ) of 634 FM4 - 64 dye ( Invitrogen , USA ) was added directly to the fungal mycelia . After 10 min 635 incubation , FM4 - 64 dye was rinsed from slides thoroughly before imaging fungal hyphae . 636 Images were captured in TCS SP8 . 637 For host penetration assay , infected chickpea leaves ( WT and Δarf - bar ) were placed in 638 100 % ethanol for 48 h to undergo bleaching for the complete removal of chlorophyll . 639 Subsequently , leaves were incubated for 4 h in 10 % KOH at RT followed by washing 4 - 5 times 640 in Phosphate buffer saline ( PBS , pH 7 . 4 ) . The processed leaves were then stained with chitin 641 specific dye WGA - AF 488 ( Invitrogen , USA ) . The leaf samples were rinsed in PBS ( pH 7 . 5 ) 642 before microscopic visualization . Confocal images were captured on a TCS SP5 confocal 643 microscope . 644 For sub - cellular localization of ArCRZ1 : : EYFP under oxidative stress condition , 645 chimeric protein - expressing fungal conidia were isolated and allowed to grow for 12 h . The 646 hyphae were exposed to CaCl 2 ( 200 mM , Sigma - Aldrich , USA ) for 1 min prior to microscopy . 647 To assess the involvement of calcineurin in nuclear localization of ArCRZ1 : : EYFP , the hyphae 648 was exposed to 5 µg / µl FK506 ( Sigma - Aldrich , USA ) , 5 min prior to the addition of CaCl 2 . The 649 confocal images were acquired in TCS SP5 . 650 For subcellular localization of ArCRZ1 : : EYFP during infection , susceptible plants were 651 challenged with conidia expressing ArCRZ1 : : EYFP .
