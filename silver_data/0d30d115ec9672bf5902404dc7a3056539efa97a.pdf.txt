There exists a large amount of data supporting the basis for their interaction in vitro and their function in clathrin uncoating in vivo . This review examines the key exper - iments in elucidating this interaction and introduces a third protein that may connect constriction or fission with hsc70 / auxilin mediated clathrin uncoating . INTRODUCTION The formation of the clathrin coat in receptor mediat - ed endocytosis ( RME ) requires a number of players . At the membrane , adaptor proteins ( AP - 1 and 2 recognize the cargo receptors and initiate the assembly of the clathrin triskelion . Then the triskelion legs interact with each other through their heavy chains and form the polyhedral lattice . The formation of this coat , which causes the membrane to deform and induces invagination , is thought to drive budding ( Schmid , 1997 ) . Once the vesicle is internalized , another set of protein players must come into action . They are required for the removal of the clathrin coat to allow two major events : ( 1 ) fusion of the vesicle to the target membrane and ( 2 ) recycling of coat components ( Goldstein et al . , 1979 ) . This is the key transition step that connects two protein families , emphasizing the importance of protein localization . The heat shock protein 70kDa ( Hsp70 ) and heat shock protein 90kDa ( Hsp90 ) , both part of the heat shock family of proteins , as well as chaperonins are well known molecular chaperones that assist in protein folding and prevent aggregation of unfolded proteins ( Frydman , 2001 ) . Hsp70 and heat shock cognate 70kDa ( Hsc70 ) , which is constitutively expressed in the cytosol , use adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) binding and hydroly - sis to power their interactions with a wide range of unfolded substrates ( Greene et al . , 1995 ) . One way to harness the chaperones’ ability to modulate protein conformation is through binding co - chaperone domains in “adaptor proteins . ” These co - chaperones also regulate the intrinsic ATPase activity of Hsc70 ( Frydman , 2001 ) . There are three classes of co - chaperone domains : ( 1 ) DNA J homology or J domain , ( 2 ) Bag - 1 homology or Bag domain , and ( 3 ) Tetratricopeptide repeat ( TRP ) clamp domain . The J domain transfers a bound protein substrate to Hsc70 - ATP and stimulates ATP hydrolysis , which enhances binding of Hsc70 - ADP to target sub - strates ( Suh et al . , 1998 ) . The Bag domain works in an opposite manner , where its activation of the Hsc70 ATPase domain stimulates ADP to ATP exchange and causes the release of substrates ( Sodermann et al . , 2001 ) . The TRP clamp domains have been shown to bind both Hsp90 and Hsc70 , but only inhibit Hsp90 ATPase cycle ( Scheufler et al . , 2000 ) . There are around 15 characterized co - chaperone proteins , expressed from fungi to yeast and mammals . Each has their pref - erence for Hsc70 or Hsp90 , and each utilize an addi - tional substrate interaction domain ( i . e . , clathrin , PLCgamma , or myosin binding sites ) to help localize heat shock protein for specific functions ( Young et al . , 2003 ) . Auxilin is a specific family of J domain containing pro - tein that is expressed in a wide range of organisms . Mammalian auxilin has a characteristic C - terminal J domain ( a conserved HDP tripeptide ) along with a clathrin - binding domain ( Lemmon , 2001 ) . Auxilin - 1 is expressed mainly in the brain , whereas auxilin - 2 is more ubiquitously expressed and contains an addition - al cyclin - G Associated protein Kinase ( GAK ) domain . Understanding the significance of Hsc70 interaction with auxilin may explain their functional role in uncoating of clathrin coated vesicles . DEFINING INTERACTIONS Hsc70 was first discovered in bovine brain cytosol as a participant of in vitro clathrin uncoating assays ( Schlossman et al . , 1984 ) . Originally this chaperone was called ‘the uncoating ATPase’ until antibodies and sequence analysis using 2 - dimensional gels and prote - olysis mapping confirmed its identity as the 70kD stress protein ( Ungewickell , 1985 ; Chappell et al . , 1986 ) . Additional studies suggested that a cofactor was involved in Hsc70 mediated clathrin uncoating . Adding purified bovine Hsc70 and ATP to purified clathrin with AP - 2 , forming preassembled baskets , was insufficient to stimulate uncoating unless a 100 kDA protein cofac - tor isolated from coated vesicles was added into the reaction ( Prasad et al . , 1993 ) . This cofactor was identi - 58 EJBM , Copyright © 2005 4 S CIENTIFIC R EVIEW Role of Auxilin and Heat Shock Protein 70kDa in Clathrin Uncoating fied as auxilin - 1 . Immunodepletion of this protein from brain cytosol inhibited coat dissociation , and uncoating was only restored when recombinant auxilin - 1 , Hsc70 , and ATP was added back ( Ungewickell et al . , 1995 ) . Structural analysis showed that auxilin - 1 had a high affinity for certain domains of the clathrin baskets , along with an ability to recruit Hsc70 to the basket in an ATP dependent manner . When auxilin - 1 lost its J domain , it was still able to bind to clathrin but was defective in Hsc70 mediated uncoating ( Ungewickell et al . , 1995 ) . Direct binding substrates for the J domain ( Hsc70 ) and its adjacent clathrin binding domain were confirmed using glutathione - S - transferase ( GST ) - constructs . Both domains retained their respective binding properties when incubated separately with preassembled baskets and Hsc70 / ATP , and only induced dissociation of clathrin baskets when expressed together in the pres - ence of ATP ( Holstein et al . , 1996 ) . Thus , rapid hydroly - sis of ATP was observed when the J domain and Hsc70 interacted , supporting a model where ( 1 ) auxilin - 1 interacts with the clathrin heavy chain via its clathrin binding domain and ( 2 ) the J domain then directs Hsc70 to this complex , which initiates basket dissociation in an ATP dependent manner . FUNCTIONAL STUDIES Understanding the functional significance of these interactions came with the design of highly specific antibodies and utilization of multiple microscopic tech - niques . Hsc70 antibodies that blocked in vitro clathrin uncoating were microinjected into cultured cells , reducing the amount of functional Hsc70 and disrupt - ing the endocytic pathways of labeled ligand for low density lipoprotein ( LDL ) receptors and Fc ( FcRII ) recep - tors ( Honing et al . , 1994 ) . Honing et al . used immuno - fluorescence , confocal laser scanning microscopy , scan - ning electron microscopy ( EM ) , and thin section microscopy to show that blocking Hsc70 caused accu - mulation of ligand at the clathrin pits . Yet still , this was not direct evidence that uncoating was affected . A group in Germany discovered that GAK was the non - neuronal form of auxilin that was expressed ubiqui - tously in eukaryotic cells , called auxilin - 2 ( Umeda et al . , 2000 ) . They determined its binding specificities for alpha and gamma appendages ( of AP2 and AP1 , respectively ) using GST - auxilin - 2 , and confirmed that ATP - dependent uncoating of clathrin vesicles required the J - domains of both Hsc - 70 and auxilin - 2 . More importantly , when they overexpressed green fluores - cent protein ( GFP ) - auxilin - 2 in HeLa cells , not only was the endocytosis of transferrin ( Tfn ) inhibited , but clathrin was sequestered in cytosolic aggregates that co - localized with GFP - auxilin - 2 while AP - 1 and AP - 2 remained membrane associated ( Umeda et al . , 2000 ) . These results supported an in vivo interaction between auxilin and clathrin , but did not provide evidence for Hsc70 - auxilin mediated clathrin uncoating . This required ablation of endogenous auxilin , via antisense or inactivating antibodies , or using dominant negative Hsc70 and looking into model systems to link genetic defects to physiological effects . Studies by two groups separately isolated the yeast homolog of auxilin ( Swa2p / Aux1 ) and showed for the first time auxilin’s essential role in clathrin function in vivo ( Gali et al . , 2000 ; Pishavee et al . , 2000 ) . The first group , Gali et al . , used Swa2p as bait in GST pull downs , confirming in vivo interactions with clathrin and map - ping the activation of Hsc70 ATPase activity to the J and TRP domains . Generating SWA2 mutant yeast cells revealed hallmark phenotypes of clathrin deficient yeast strains : ( 1 ) secretion of unprocessed alpha factor , ( 2 ) mislocalization of a late golgi protein , and ( 3 ) endo - cytic defects in the uptake of ‘a - factor plasma’ mem - brane receptor during pulse chase experiments . Differential centrifugation was used to separate pellets containing clathrin coated vesicles ( CCV ) from free clathrin in the supernatant . SWA2 mutants showed a marked increase in clathrin association with vesicles at the expense of the free clathrin pool . Since this equi - librium of assembled and unassembled clathrin was observed in wild - type cells , it implied that Swa2p was needed to uncoat CCVs to allow recycling and continu - ous rounds of endocytosis to occur . Thin EM sections confirmed that Swa2 deletion mutant yeast accumulat - ed abnormal amounts of clathrin at the membrane and not in the vesicles ( Gali et al . , 2000 ) . The second group , Pishvaee et al . , called their auxilin yeast homolog Aux1 ( Pishavee et al . , 2000 ) and showed , using similar assays as described above , that targeted gene replacement of Aux1 impaired cargo delivery and caused an accumulation of CCVs . EM of the clathrin fraction and column chromatography results confirmed clathrin accumulation in the coated pits . In situ analysis and immunofluorescence , using antibodies against clathrin light chain , confirmed clathrin redistribution in vivo in the mutant cell . Immunogold labeling of clathrin light chain in ultra thin cryosections allowed quantification of a 5 . 5 fold increase in coated vesicles for the mutant cells . In addi - tion , they created an Aux1 mutant lacking its J domain , which still resulted in CCV accumulation , implying that the J domain , which interacts with Hsc70 , is important for uncoating in vivo . Uncoating is also required for the efficient delivery of cargo , which is perturbed in these mutant cells ( Pishavee et al . , 2000 ) . These results confirm auxilin’s role in Hsc70 mediated uncoating and exemplify how a system can be used to investigate the function of potential uncoating factors . Additional work on clathrin uncoating has been per - formed in other organisms . Auxilin homologue in Caenorhabditis elegans ( C . elegans ) contains 18 % The Einstein Journal of Biology and Medicine 59 4 S CIENTIFIC R EVIEW Role of Auxilin and Heat Shock Protein 70kDa in Clathrin Uncoating amino acid identity and its J domain is 33 % identical ( Greener et al . , 2001 ) . Greener et al . took advantage of the fact that C . elegans oocytes yolk protein ( YP170 ) uptake employs a similar mechanism to LDL endocyto - sis in mammals ( Grant and Hirsch , 1999 ) , and used ribonucleic acid interference ( RNAi ) to inhibit auxilin expression . They wanted to monitor clathrin uncoat - ing / recycling by labeling the heavy chains or cargo with GFP , fixing the samples at each corresponding step , and using laser scanning confocal microscopy to monitor the vesicles and cargo . They first showed that endocy - tosis of GFP - YP170 , but not its secretion , was reduced in RNAi treated worms . Auxilin RNAi treated larvae expressing a transgene for GFP - clathrin heavy chain ( GFP - CHC ) showed a brighter , punctate fluorescence in somatic cells , implying an accumulation of clathrin coated vesicles . This conclusion would be stronger if they used a clathrin antibody to check endogenous lev - els of clathrin and confirm that the accumulation was not an effect of overexpression . One striking result was that survival rate for RNAi treated worms increased from 40 % to almost 100 % when expressing GFP - CHC . Although auxilin is knocked down , thus preventing recycling of clathrin , GFP - CHC worms overexpressing clathrin may partially compensate for recycling defects . Additional evidence for recycling defects used fluores - cence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) . After pho - tobleaching a portion of the larvae , recovery of fluo - rescence can reveal whether clathrin exchange occurs , with unbleached fluorescence proteins replacing the photobleached proteins in a time dependant manner . As expected , GFP - CHC worms showed complete recov - ery of fluorescence whereas RNAi auxilin worms did not ( Greener , Grant et al , 2001 ) . Drosophila melanogaster ( D . melanogster ) is a third model organism used to screen proteins for their func - tion in RME . Endosomal internalization of the Boss receptor , stimulated by the Sevenless binding in D . melanogster eyes , uses a dynamin dependent pathway ( Caganm et al . , 1992 ) . Screens of mutant flies with defi - ciencies in Boss internalization identified a point muta - tion in the fly homolog of Hsc70 ( Chang et al . , 2002 ) . Mutant Hsc70 - 4 flies were generated by FLP / FRP recom - bination and were screened for horseradish peroxidase positive ( HRP + ) vesicles . There was a block in internal - ization seen by a lack of uptake of endocytic tracers and Texas red labeled avidin in flies with a transgene for endosomal markers . Immunostaining and EM analy - sis in these mutant cells confirmed that avidin endocy - tosis was blocked , whereas HRP + vesicles , clathrin coat - ed vesicles , and labyrinthine channels characteristic of shibere mutants ( Kosaka and Ikeda , 1983 ) , on or near the plasma membrane , were absent . GFP - clathrin light chain was used to confirm that clathrin was centrally located in Hsc70 - 4 mutant cells . HRP - Boss and 2 - mer - captoethanesulfonic acid ( MESNA ) treated enzyme - linked immunoassay ( ELISA ) assays confirmed that mutant Hsc70 - 4 cells had proper Boss delivery to the plasma membrane but could not be internalized . In vitro binding analysis using Hsc70 - 4 mutants ( R447H ) did not affect clathrin or auxilin binding , yet clathrin uncoating was still compromised when measuring clathrin release from CCV ( Chang et al . , 2002 ) . Only a 33 % reduction was observed , probably since a null mutation in Hsc70 - 4 is lethal to cells . Nonetheless this modest reduction of in vitro uncoating activity was still sufficient to cause a dramatic reduction in endocytosis in vivo . One should note that these results only support a correlative observation between Hsc70 - auxilin inter - action and uncoating , and any cause and effect evi - dence requires clathrin uncoating to be measured in vivo . BIOCHEMICAL CHARACTERIZATION The in vitro and in vivo experiments described above support an interaction for Hsc70 and auxilin in clathrin uncoating . Another major focus is to understand the biochemistry of this interaction . It is believed that Hsc70 sequentially forms 2 types of complexes with the clathrin triskelions . In the first step , binding of auxilin to one clathrin triskelion causes further binding of three Hsc70 - ATP molecules ( Green and Eisenberg , 1990 ) . Next , the rapid catalysis of Hsc70 - ATP hydrolysis by auxilin triggers the dissociation of the clathrin triskelion from the basket . This leaves an uncoated triskelion with Hsc70 - ADP bound to it , called the pre - steady state complex , and free auxilin continues to act catalytically by directly attaching to another triskelion in the basket and initiating another round of uncoat - ing ( Barouch et al . , 1997 ) . The released Hsc70 - ADP / clathrin complex transforms from the pre - steady state to a steady state complex after ATP exchange , and this complex requires the pres - ence of AP - 180 and Hsc70 to keep it intact ( Jiang , et al . , 2001 ) . The pre - steady state / adenosine diphosphate ( ADP ) bound form cannot be immunoprecipitated easi - ly and can dissociate rapidly , so the exchange of ADP for ATP alters and stabilizes the structure of the AP - clathrin - Hsc70 complex . This supports the model that Hsc70 acts stoichiometrically , where formation of the energetically stable steady state Hsc70 - ATP / clathrin complex acts as the driving force for uncoating . This steady state complex also ties up the cytosolic triske - lion , thus preventing it from inappropriately binding to proteins actively involved in endocytosis . This has been supported by in vivo studies showing redistribution of clathrin away from the coated pits / membranes when auxilin or AP - 180 is overexpressed ( Zhoa et al . 2001 ) . The steady state complex is also proposed to “prime clathrin to interact with membranes” ( Jiang et al . , 2000 ) and allow rapid return of AP and clathrin to form a new coated pit . The steady state complex can now be used to characterize additional proteins and regulatory factors that are required for clathrin and AP recycling . 60 EJBM , Copyright © 2005 4 S CIENTIFIC R EVIEW Role of Auxilin and Heat Shock Protein 70kDa in Clathrin Uncoating Much effort has also been placed in trying to deter - mine the auxilin structure required to transfer clathrin to Hsc70 - ADP . Structures for Escherichia coli ( E . coli ) J domain presenting iron - sulfur cluster protein to Hsc66 ( Hsc70 homolog ) ( Cupp - Vickery and Vickery , 2000 ) , and SV40 large T - antigen J domain binding retinoblastoma ( Rb ) tumor suppressor ( Kim et al . , 2001 ) have been determined . For auxilin , Ma et al . has mapped 2 sepa - rate domains : ( 1 ) a C - terminal sub domain , within the clathrin binding domain , that is required for auxilin catalytic activity and ( 2 ) an N - terminal domain that enhances the binding to clathrin ( Ma et al . , 2002 ) . Scheele et al . has also characterized the C - terminal domain , Aux - C20 , and showed it contains the key inter - actions with clathrin and AP - 2 to support clathrin uncoating ( Scheele , et al . , 2001 ) . Since full length 100kD auxilin and the 60kDa recombinant fragment which has full uncoating activity , were too large to crystallize , one group used the Aux - C20 fragment to determine the 3 - dimensional structure of auxilin bind - ing domain via nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) ( Gruschus and Hanetal , 2004 ) . Their conclusion showed marked differences in the binding domains and the ori - entation in Aux - C20 compared to E . coli and large T anti - gen J proteins , implying that J domains determine which specific substrate is to be transferred to Hsc - 70 . This reflects the importance of understanding how J domain proteins interactions specify its function . A NEW PROTEIN PLAYER The dynamin superfamily of guanosine triphosphatase ( GTPase ) has been implicated in the scission of a wide range of vesicles and organelles . In clathrin mediated endocytosis , dynamin self assembles into coiled struc - tures at the neck of the invaginated pits and stimulates its GTPase , which drives dynamin disassembly ( Praefcke and McMahon , 2004 ) . There exist 2 competing models for dynamin function in RME : ( 1 ) dynamin functions as a mechanochemical enzyme to physically drive mem - brane vesiculation by acting as a ' pinchase ' to constrict and sever invaginated pits at their neck or ( 2 ) dynamin functions as a regulatory molecule in endocytic CCV formation to recruit and / or activate downstream effec - tors in its GTP - bound form ( Yang and Cerione , 1999 ) . Recent data from coated pit dynamics supports the lat - ter model . Uptake of fluorescently labeled transferrin at short time intervals was observed using a GFP - clathrin light chain fusion in COS - 1 cells ( Gaidarov et al . , 1999 ) . Automated tracking programs taking sequential time lapse images showed that clathrin coated pits had lim - ited mobility and repeatedly formed coated vesicles at discrete sites . Addition of latrunculin B , an inhibitor to actin assembly , showed partial inhibition of RME . This implied that pit formation was initiated on the cytoskeleton and may be regulated by protein factors recruited by the cytoskeleton , one potentially being dynamin ( Estes et al . , 1996 ) . Advances in microscopy now allow real - time imaging of cargo sorting and endocytosis in living cells ( Ehrlich et al . , 2004 ) , which confirmed the dynamics of clathrin assembly and corre - lated it to the dynamics of dynamin in these coated pits . When a D . melanogaster Hsc70 mutant was crossed with a fly line containing a dominant negative allele of dynamin , shi , there was an enhancement of the rough eye phenotype ( Chang et al . , 2002 ) , suggest - ing a connection between the two pathways . Characterization of dominant interfering Hsc70 mutants expressed in HeLa cells showed additional defects in endocytosis that could not be accounted for by uncoat - ing alone ( Newmeyer and Schmid , 2001 ) . These mutants inhibited clathrin release during in vitro uncoating assays and caused retainment of all internal - ized transferrin , supporting a defect in uncoating and recycling . In addition , the mutant Tfn trafficking assays also showed defects in the initial uptake of biotinlayt - ed Tfn , during avidin quenching ELISA and in the pres - ence of MESNA treatment , suggesting that coated vesi - cle formation was also inhibited by the dominant inter - fering Hsc70 . The best direct link comes from a paper describing aux - ilin and Hsc70 interactions with dynamin in the early stage of coated vesicle formation ( Newmyer et al . , 2003 ) . Dynamin has an intramolecular domain called the GTPase effector domain ( GED ) that controls its GTPase activity by acting as a GTPase activating protein ( GAP ) . Effectors from rat brain cytosol that interacted with GTP bound dynamin were isolated from in vitro GST - dynamin GTPase columns , supplemented with its GED / GAP domain and GTP - gamma - S . These substrates , Hsc70 and auxilin , were eluted using GDP and were not pulled down in the GDP column , proving that their interaction with dynamin was GTP dependent . Direct binding was confirmed using recombinant auxilin and purified Hsc70 with Gst - dynamin : GTPgammaS . When GTP hydrolysis was measured using dynamin - GTP in the presence of its GAP , addition of auxilin , but not Hsc70 , inhibited hydrolysis in a cooperative manner . Increasing concentrations of the GAP overcame the inhibition , suggesting that auxilin and GAP competed for the same binding site . Mapping domains in auxilin revealed 2 dynamin binding sites : an upstream site ( 405 - 491 ) and a downstream site ( 591 - 814 ) [ previously shown to interact with clathrin an AP - 2 ( Scheele , Kalthoff et al . , 2001 ] . The upstream binding site also did not inhibit clathrin uncoating in vitro , but was proved to be essential in coat formation . When HeLa cells were transfected with the 405 - 491 fragment , it acted as a dominant negative by blocking single round biotinylated Tfn sequestering into coated vesicles . This suggested that auxilin contains tandem binding sites which regulate CCV formation and uncoating in a sequential manner . A new model was proposed where : ( 1 ) auxilin and hsc70 are recruited by clathrin to be The Einstein Journal of Biology and Medicine 61 4 S CIENTIFIC R EVIEW Role of Auxilin and Heat Shock Protein 70kDa in Clathrin Uncoating involved in the initial stages of invagination , ( 2 ) auxilin may counteract dynamin’s GAP activity promoting sta - bilization of the coat at the membrane which in turns promotes invagination , and ( 3 ) Hsc70 - auxilin activity drives conformational changes in clathrin coat which drives constriction . Here dynamin acts as a regulatory protein that couples several rounds of clathrin uncoat - ing to drive constriction and fission . CONCLUSION In vitro assays have proven that auxilin and Hsc70 both interact with clathrin , adaptor proteins , and now dynamin . The latter interaction supports a new role for both auxilin and Hsc70 in RME . In the current model auxilin is thought to bind to assembled clathrin vesicles and recruit Hsc70 - ATP , where stimulation of the ATPase activity would disrupt clathrin - clathrin interactions and cause release of the coat . This model can now be mod - ified to include additional steps for auxilin and Hsc70 , where 2 separate binding domains in auxilin help reg - ulate chaperone mediated activity spatially and tempo - rally , which includes regulation of vesicle formation . The role of Hsc70 in early stages of RME has been observed in vivo using dominant negative proteins , and overexpression of auxilin has been shown to inhibit clathrin formation . Future in vivo experiments should use knock down experiments of dynamin or Hsc70 , with a focus on the early steps in endocytosis . They can take advantage of well - developed model organisms described above and advances in microscopy to help define the new roles for dynamin and auxilin / Hsc70 chaperone machinery in vesicle formation and fission .
