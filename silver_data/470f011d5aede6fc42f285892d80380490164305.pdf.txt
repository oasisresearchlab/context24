Gap junction - mediated cell - cell interactions have been implicated in the modulation of endothelial cell functions during vascular inflammation . Inflammatory mediators alter the mechanical properties of endothelial cells , although the exact role of gap junctions in this process remains unclear . Here , we sought to study the role of gap junctions in the regulation of endothelial stiffness , an important physical feature that is associated with many vascular pathologies . The endothelial cellular stiffness of living endothelial cells was determined by using atomic force microscopy . We found that tumor necrosis factor - α transiently increased endothelial cellular stiffness , which is regulated by cytoskeletal rearrangement and cell - cell interactions . We explored the role of gap junctions in endothelial cellular stiffening by utilizing gap junction blockers , carbenoxolone , inhibitory anti - connexin 32 antibody or anti - connexin 43 antibody . Blockade of gap junctions induced the cellular stiffening associated with focal adhesion formation and cytoskeletal rearrangement , and prolonged tumor necrosis factor - α - induced endothelial cellular stiffening . These results suggest that gap junction - mediated cell - cell interactions play an important role in the regulation of endothelial cellular stiffness . Endothelial cells ( ECs ) have been shown in vitro to increase their cellular stiffness when they were subjected to shear stress 1 , pro - inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor - α ( TNF - α ) 2 , and oxidized low - density lipopro - tein 3 , 4 . Depletion of cholesterol was found to increase endothelial cellular stiffness 5 . Furthermore , sub - endothelial substrate stiffness has been shown to be an important determinant of endothelial cellular stiffness 6 , 7 . Increased stiffness of the vascular wall and sub - endothelial tissues has been implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclero - sis 8 , 9 and vascular inflammation 10 , 11 ; however , mechanisms regulating alteration of ECs themselves remains less well defined . Cytoskeletal rearrangement plays a major role in the regulation of cellular stiffness 9 , 12 , and both the acto - myosin cytoskeleton and filamentous actin ( F - actin ) are important determinants of cellular stiffness 13 . The Rho - actomyosin pathway is known to be involved in regulating the cytoskeletal rearrangement induced by inflammatory mediators such as thrombin 14 and TNF - α 15 . Rho kinase inhibits myosin light chain phosphatase , promoting the phosphorylation of myosin light chains and resulting in increased myosin activity in the acto - myosin cytoskeleton 16 , 17 . Activation of the Rho - actomyosin signaling pathway enhances the formation of actin bundles , stress fibers , and tensile actomyosin structures 18 , all of which correlate with cellular stiffness 13 , 19 . The Rho pathway is also involved in integrin - dependent focal adhesion formation 20 . Integrins are essential for sensing substrate rigidity and generating the contractile forces associated with actin rearrangement 21 that lead to cellular stiffening . This suggests the important roles played by integrin - mediated EC - extracellular matrix interactions in regulating endothelial cellular stiffness . In addition to the interaction of ECs with the sub - endothelial matrix , the lateral hemophilic interactions between ECs have similarly been suggested to play a role in regulating cellular stiffness 12 , 22 .

GJs connect and synchronize the intracellular environment of neighboring cells by promoting the transfer of ions , amino acids , small metabolites , and secondary messengers 23 , 24 . GJs are formed by members of the connexin ( Cx ) family , which contains at least 20 highly conserved proteins with tissue - specific expression patterns 25 . Cx32 , Cx37 , Cx40 , and Cx43 are expressed by ECs 26 , 27 . These Cxs induce signaling via associating proteins , such as regulatory proteins , phosphatases and protein kinases , catenins , structural proteins , and micro - tubules 28 . Deletion of Cx40 from ECs , as well as the dysfunction of Cx37 , can promote the development of ath - erosclerosis by enhancing both monocyte adhesion and transmigration 29 , 30 . Alternatively , reduced expression of Cx43 by smooth muscle cells inhibits the formation of atherosclerotic lesions 31 , while the deletion of Cx43 modulates renin secretion , thereby leading to hypertension 32 . A Cx43 mutation in patients with cardiac infarction has been identified 33 . Abnormal expression and dysfunction of endothelial Cxs have been associated with the onset of cardiovas - cular diseases 29 – 31 . We have previously shown that the Cx32 - mediated intercellular transfer of small molecules decreases upon inflammation 34 , and that aberrant endothelial Cx32 increases pro - inflammatory cytokines 34 and pro - coagulant tissue factor expression 35 . Furthermore , we have shown that Cx32 enhances angiogenesis - related endothelial tube formation and migration , while Cx43 reduces them 36 . Although EC - EC communications via Cxs have been shown to regulate many EC functions such as leukocyte adhesion 29 , 30 , vascular permeability 37 , and angiogenesis 38 , it remains to be determined how Cxs regulate cellular stiffness . Here , using an atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) - based approach , we aimed to investigate whether endothelial cellular stiffening is induced by the aberrant regulation of GJs caused by inflammatory mediators . Results ECs stiffness increases in response to inflammatory stimulation . In order to determine the stiff - ness of primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) , we utilized AFM to measure the force curve only on the cell body , excluding the measurements on the nucleus or the cell edge . Cell stiffness was determined by analyzing the obtained force curve and reconstructing it as a stiffness image . The mean stiffness of normal HUVECs was approximately 10 . 4 kPa . In addition , we measured the stiffness of human aortic ECs ( 8 . 2 kPa ) , human pulmonary artery ECs ( 7 . 8 kPa ) , and human lung microvascular ECs ( 9 . 5 kPa ) . To study endothelial cellu - lar stiffness upon stimulation with inflammatory mediators , we used HUVECs treated with the pro - inflammatory cytokine TNF - α , in order to model inflamed endothelial cells 39 . We stimulated confluent HUVECs with TNF - α for 4 hours and 24 hours in serum - free media , and then measured cellular stiffness ( Fig . 1A ) . After 4 hours , endothelial cellular stiffness was remarkably increased , compared to non - stimulated control cells ; rigid fibrillate structures were observed in TNF - α - stimulated HUVECs ( Fig . 1A ) . Although ECs increased their stiffness in response to TNF - α stimulation at 4 hours , the stiffness of HUVECs returned to baseline levels at 24 hours . Thrombin , another inflammatory mediator that processes pro - coagulation activity , was tested . Thrombin acti - vates ECs via protease activated receptor - 1 and then induced Rho - mediated contraction 14 . Subsequently , Rho induced an increase in vascular permeability and the inflammatory responses associated with actin rearrange - ment 14 . Thrombin stimulation increased cellular stiffness after stimulation for 4 hours , and returned to baseline levels at 24 hours , as is shown in the stimulatory conditions using TNF - α ( Supplemental Fig . 1 ) . These results have shown that ECs increase cellular stiffness in response to pro - inflammatory stimulation . Actin rearrangement aids the increase of endothelial cellular stiffness . Pro - inflammatory stim - ulation induces stress fiber formation in HUVECs via actin rearrangement 40 , 41 . After TNF - α stimulation for 4 hours , rigid fibrillate structures were observed in the TNF - α - stimulated HUVECs associated with endothe - lial cellular stiffening ( Fig . 1A ) . To study the effect of cytoskeletal rearrangement on endothelial cellular stiff - ness , we investigated the relationship between rigid fibrillate structure and actin rearrangement by using the Lifeact - enhanced green fluorescent protein ( EGFP ) fusion protein expressed in HUVECs . Cellular stiffness at the sites of actin accumulation was higher than that at non - accumulated areas in HUVECs ( Fig . 2A ) . In addi - tion , blebbistatin , a selective inhibitor of myosin II , attenuated TNF - α - induced rigid fibrillate structures and endothelial cellular stiffening ( Fig . 2B , C ) . Cytochalasin D , an actin polymerization inhibitor , also impaired the rigid fibrillate structures and cellular stiffening of HUVECs ( Supplemental Fig . 2 ) . These findings suggest that TNF - α - induced actin rearrangement is a major determinant of endothelial cellular stiffening . Cell - cell interactions contribute to endothelial cellular stiffening . Cell - cell interactions influ - ence the regulation of cellular stiffness and morphological changes 12 ; however , the specific contributions of GJ - mediated cell - cell interactions to the regulation of cellular stiffness are as yet not fully understood . Consistent with the previous finding 12 , the stiffness of non - confluent HUVECs was higher than that of confluent HUVECs ( Fig . 3 ) , thereby supporting the contribution of cell - cell interactions to the regulation of cellular stiffness . As con - fluent cells are capable of signaling each other via GJs , this led us to examine the roles of GJs in regulating cellular stiffness . To interfere with the GJ functions , we treated confluent HUVECs with the GJ inhibitor carbenoxolone ( CBX ) . CBX treatment increased endothelial cellular stiffness ( Fig . 4A ) . The effects of individual applications of CBX or TNF - α in order to increase endothelial cellular stiffness were found to be transient in nature . The effects were seen at 4 hours or 6 hours but not at 24 hours ( Fig . 4 ) . By contrast , the effects of simultaneous application of CBX and TNF - α were found to be persistent , indeed remaining visible up to 24 hours . We confirmed that , like CBX , another inhibitor oleamide also increased endothelial cellular stiffness ( data not shown ) . These inhibitor treatments blocked the GJ function of HUVECs , but did not alter the morphology of HUVECs ( not shown ) . Subsequently , we blocked GJ functionality via an alternative approach involving intracellular delivery of anti - bodies to the cytoplasmic domain of Cx 35 , 36 . While the GJ inhibitors CBX and oleamide non - selectively inhibited Cxs 42 , 43 , intracellularly transferred anti - Cxs monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) blocked Cx - specific GJ formation and function . HUVECs endogenously express Cx32 , Cx37 , Cx40 , and Cx43 , which form GJs 27 . We previously showed www . nature . com / scientificreports / 3 SCientifiC RePORTS | 7 : 6134 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41598 - 017 - 06463 - x that Cx32 and Cx43 in HUVECs contribute more to the functional phenotypes of ECs than do Cx37 and Cx40 35 , 36 . We therefore focused on Cx32 and Cx43 , and intracellularly delivered anti - Cx32 mAb or anti - Cx43 mAb into HUVECs in order to block Cx32 - and / or Cx43 - mediated GJs ( Fig . 4B ) . Both antibodies increased cellular stiff - ness compared with the use of control IgG . These results suggest that the GJs formed by Cx32 and / or Cx43 are important to the regulation of endothelial cellular stiffness . F - actin localization and focal adhesion formation in the GJ blockade of HUVECs . We explored how GJ inhibition affected F - actin and focal adhesion . An individual application of TNF - α or CBX induced stress - fiber - like structures in HUVECs compared with untreated HUVECs ( Fig . 5B ) , although total F - actin con - tent , as assessed by flow cytometry , was not altered following TNF - α and / or CBX stimulation ( Supplemental Fig . 3 ) . Then we assessed the formation of focal adhesion in HUVECs by using vinculin staining ( Fig . 6 ) . The size and number of vinculin signals in HUVECs treated with TNF - α or CBX were greater compared with vehicle - treated control HUVECs . Cells simultaneously treated with TNF - α and CBX tended to increase the for - mation of focal adhesion compared with cells treated with TNF - α only . GJ inhibition appears to facilitate focal adhesion formations , thereby leading to cellular stiffening of HUVECs . Discussion Several studies have suggested that the regulatory mechanism governing cellular stiffness involves a cell - to - substrate component 6 , 7 , 44 , as well as cell - to - cell interactions 22 . It has been reported that a non - confluent single cell promotes spreading and enhances cell - substrate interactions by integrin - dependent focal adhesion formation 12 . These cellular responses generate contraction forces in a single cell , thereby resulting in increasing cellular stiffness . In contrast to an individual cell , a cell in a confluent monolayer , which restricts the space avail - able for cell spreading , establishes cell - cell junctions along with cell - substrate interactions 12 . As interactions with adjacent cells impair the generation of contraction forces via cell - to - substrate interactions , an individual cell is Figure 1 .

Furthermore , in a confluent monolayer , the weakening of cell - cell interactions by anti - vascular endothelial cadherin ( VE - cadherin ) antibody or low - dose cytochalasin B treatments augmented , in turn , cell - substrate interactions 12 , thereby leading to the stiffening of cells . Thus , the balance of adhesive strengths at the cell - substrate level ( e . g . , via integrins ) and cell - cell ( e . g , via VE - cadherin ) interactions would be an important mechanism for determining cellular stiffness . This concept is consistent with our results that the weakening of Cx - mediated cell - cell interactions leads to an increase in focal adhesion formation , which is indicative of the augmented cell - substrate interactions associated with the stiffening of cells . The link between Cxs with cytoskeletal proteins has been previously described . Chen and colleagues have reported that Cx43 associates with the F - actin cytoskeleton through zona occulden - 1 ( ZO - 1 ) , thus facilitating cell spreading and exploration during locomotion 45 . In addition , Cx proteins associate with other intracellular pro - teins , such as phosphatases and protein kinases , catenins , structural proteins , and microtubules . Cx32 interacts with Src , calmodulin , claudin , occludin , and β catenin 46 , 47 , whereas Cx43 interacts with ZO - 1 , Src family mem - bers , protein kinases , phosphatases and others 48 . Moreover , other groups have found that GJs possibly regulate the cell migration and polarization associated with cytoskeletal rearrangement 49 . In our study , the data indicates that Figure 2 .

Our results suggest that GJs may modulate cellular stiffness through the actin rearrangement regulated by GJ - associated proteins . In this study , we have shown that perturbation of GJ functions induced endothelial cellular stiffening and augmented TNF - α - mediated endothelial cellular stiffening partly by modulating cytoskeletal rearrangement and the formation of focal adhesion . While TNF - α induces EC activation and stiffening , it also , on the other hand , regulates Cx expression and the GJ function of ECs . It has been shown that TNF - α reduced mRNA and protein expression of Cx32 , Cx37 , and Cx40 , and up - regulated Cx43 expression in cultured ECs 34 , 50 . Furthermore , TNF - α did not alter Cxs mRNA and protein expression in cultured ECs after 4 hours , but TNF - α reduced endothelial GJ function 34 . Our results have shown that endothelial cellular stiffening occurs via the blockade of GJs with and Figure 3 . Cellular stiffness of a single cell and the confluent EC monolayer .

It appears that a GJ blockade and TNF - α stimulation might act independently to induce endothelial cellular stiffening . Whereas we used TNF - α - stimulated HUVECs as a model of inflamed endothelial cells , previous studies reported contrasting effects of TNF - α on endothelial cellular stiffness . Lee and colleagues described not only an increase in the mechanical stiffness of ECs after treatment with 10 ng / mL of TNF - α for 20 hours in the presence of serum , but also an increase of the density of F - actin filaments 2 . In contrast , Stroka and colleagues found that treatment with 10 ng / mL of TNF - α for 24 hours in the presence of serum decreased HUVEC stiffness , though it did induce F - actin rearrangements 7 , 51 . Our results indicate that TNF - α transiently increases HUVEC stiffness after 4 hours of stimulation in serum - free media . Thereafter , HUVEC stiffness returns to the same stiffness level as those of non - stimulated normal ECs after 24 hours . As HUVECs have been shown to be more sensitive to TNF - α activity under serum - starved conditions , different culturing conditions might account for these contrast - ing results . Furthermore , both previous studies employed an AFM probe consisting of a 5 μ m diameter particle at the edge of the cantilevers . In our AFM system , we utilized cantilevers with a tetrahedral type probe , in order to scan the heterogeneous distribution of cellular stiffness . Measurements of cellular stiffness are influenced by the force applied over the membrane , the velocity of the probe , and the depth distance of the probe . These different settings in the AFM measurements might also explain some of the discrepancies noted in the results . Endothelial GJs play important roles in many vascular functions . The reduction in Cx37 and Cx40 expres - sion , as well as the increase in Cx43 expression , have been reported following treatment of ECs using TNF - α 50 . Alterations in endothelial Cx expression patterns have been observed during the development of cardiovascular diseases 26 , 52 . Cx37 - deficient mice enhance the expression of those pro - inflammatory genes involved in advanced atherosclerosis 53 . In addition , Cx37 protects against early atherosclerotic lesion development by regulating monocyte adhesion 30 . The deletion of Cx40 in ECs promotes the development of atherosclerosis by leukocyte adhesion 29 . In heterogeneous Cx43 knock - out mice , atherosclerotic lesion formation was reduced 31 . We have pre - viously shown not only that Cx32 expression in HUVECs is reduced after TNF - α stimulation , but also that atten - uated Cx32 facilitates vascular inflammation and coagulation 27 , 34 . Taken together , abnormal Cxs facilitate the development of atherosclerosis and vascular inflammation , both of which are based on endothelial dysfunction . Figure 5 .

Neutrophils increased cell spreading on stiffer ECs , which served as a sub - strate for adherent neutrophils 7 . In addition , other studies , as well as our own , have shown the presence of het - erogeneous stiffness gradients on the cell surface with fibrillate structures 51 . Thus , leukocytes may sense and respond to endothelial stiffness gradients from the moment of adhesion to the crawling phase of transmigration including durotaxis . The latter requires the sensing of substrate stiffness by adhesion molecule interactions 56 . Furthermore , endothelial GJs play an important role in monocyte recruitment . Specifically , reduced expression of Cx37 and Cx40 in ECs enhances monocyte adhesion and atherosclerotic plaque formation 30 . Cx40 - mediated endothelial cell - cell communication positively regulates the expression of the ecto - enzyme CD73 , which induces anti - inflammatory signaling via adenosine 29 and prevents vascular cell adhesion molecule - 1 ( VCAM - 1 ) expres - sion . We also demonstrated that GJ - blocked ECs enhance intercellular adhesion molecule - 1 , VCAM1 , and E - selectin expression after TNF - α stimulation 35 . Taken together , endothelial GJs may regulate leukocyte adhesion and transmigration through the modulation of both molecular expression patterns and the physical properties of ECs . Arterial stiffening has been observed during atherosclerosis and is a cholesterol - independent risk factor for cardiovascular events 57 – 59 . Arterial stiffness is determined by the composition of matrix components , such as elastin and collagen , in the vascular wall 60 . In addition to the reconstitution of matrix components , the increased stiffness of vascular smooth muscle cells has also been associated with aging - related arterial stiffening 61 ; however , the alteration and contribution of endothelial cellular stiffness remain unclear and has only been assumed from several in vitro and in vivo findings . Kothapalli showed the increased stiffness of the endothelial luminal surface in adventitia using an ApoE knockout atherosclerotic mouse model 8 . Schaefer and colleagues found in vitro that increased α - actinin - 4 expression enhanced cellular stiffness of HUVECs , and in vivo that human and murine atherosclerotic plaques shows elevated levels of α - actinin - 4 in ECs 9 , thereby suggesting that endothelial cellular stiffening could happen in atherosclerotic plaques in vivo . Our studies raise the possibility that aberrant endothe - lial GJs trigger endothelial cellular stiffening in the context of endothelial dysfunction . Methods Cell culture . Primary HUVECs , human aortic ECs , human pulmonary artery ECs , human lung microvascu - lar ECs , and their culture media ( EGM - 2 BulletKit ) were purchased from Lonza Japan ( Tokyo , Japan ) . HUVECs were cultured in collagen - coated tissue - culture dishes ( BD Biosciences , San Jose , CA ) in an atmosphere con - taining 95 % air and 5 % CO 2 . All experiments were performed with cultured ECs during passages 3 – 5 . Cultured HUVECs were starved overnight before treatment with TNF - α or thrombin . Recombinant TNF - α had an activity range of 1 . 0 – 100 × 10 6 units / μ g ; 10 units / mL of TNF - α was smaller than 1 ng / mL . To stimulate HUVECs , cells in serum - free media were given either 10 units / mL of TNF - α or 1 units / mL of thrombin , and continued to be Figure 6 .

The stiffness measurements of stimulated HUVECs were performed at two time points : 4 and 24 hours after the addition of TNF - α or thrombin . These experiments were performed in triplicate and yielded similar results . Blockade of GJ function in HUVECs . In order to block GJ function , HUVECs were treated with 1 μ M of CBX ( Sigma , St . Louis , MO ) for 2 hours and were then stimulated by TNF - α in the presence or absence of CBX . In our previous studies , 1 μ M of CBX completely inhibited gap junction function of HUVECs 27 . Anti - Cx32 mAb ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham , MA ) and acti - Cx43 mAb ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) were intracellularly transferred into HUVECs using PULSin protein delivery reagent ( PolyPlus - transfection , New York , NY ) 34 . Briefly , HUVECs were grown to a semi - confluent state with cell - cell contact occurring at the proliferation phase in collagen - coated 60 mm tissue culture dishes and were then washed with prewarmed PBS . Mixtures of 200 μ L HEPES buffered saline ( 20 mM HEPES , 150 mM NaCl , pH 7 . 5 ) , 2 μ g of each antibody and 8 μ L PULSin were incubated at room temperature for 15 min . HUVECs were incubated with 1800 μ L Opti - MEM ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) with 200 μ L antibody / PULSin mixture at 37 °C for 4 hours . After washing with PBS , HUVECs were incubated with fresh serum - free medium . Purified mouse IgG ( Sigma ) from serum was used as a control IgG . After CBX treatment or antibody transfer for 2 hours , HUVECs were grown to a confluent state and were then stimulated with TNF - α ( 10 units / ml ) for 4 hours and 24 hours . Subsequently , the stiffness of HUVECs that estab - lished the onset of cell - cell interactions next to adjacent cells was determined . These experiments ware performed at least two times . Visualization and inhibition of actin - cytoskeletal rearrangement . To stain filamentous actin in living HUVECs , the Lifeact - EGFP fusion protein expressing pcDNA4 vector ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) was constructed . Lifeact - EGFP stained F - actin structures in cells without interfering in actin dynamics 62 . DNA frag - ments encoding Lifeact peptide and EGFP were amplified by PCR from pEGFP - C1 plasmid ( Takara Bio , Shiga , Japan ) . PCR amplicon was ligated into pcDNA4 vector by In - Fusion HD Cloning Kit ( Takara Bio ) . Lifeact - EGFP fusion protein expressing pcDNA4 vector was transfected to HUVECs by using lipofectamin2000 ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . HUVECs were grown to 70 % confluence in collagen - coated 60 - mm tissue - culture dishes and washed with pre - warmed PBS . The transfection solution was prepared as follows , 190 μ L Opti - MEM with 10 μ L lipo - fectamin 2000 and 200 μ L Opti - MEM with 3 μ g of Lifeact - EGFP fusion protein expressing pcDNA4 vector were mixed and incubated at room temperature for 30 min . HUVECs were then incubated with a mixture of 1600 μ L Opti - MEM and 400 μ L in a transfection solution at 37 °C for 4 hours . After removing the transfection solution , HUVECs were incubated with fresh medium at 37 °C for 24 hours before use in experiments . After administra - tion for 24 hours , Lifeact - EGFP positive HUVECs were observed under an Olympus IX71 fluorescence micro - scope and the cellular stiffness was measured . HUVECs were treated with 10 μ M of blebbistatin ( Merck Millipore , Darmstadt , Germany ) or 2 μ M of Cytochalasin D , stimulated with TNF - α ( 10 units / ml ) for 4 hours , and then the stiffness of the HUVECs was determined . This experiment was performed two times . AFM to measure cellular stiffness . Young’s modulus of live HUVEC monolayers was measured using the NanoWizard 3 AFM system ( JPK Instruments AG , Berlin , Germany ) with a cantilever and a tetrahedral type probe ( BL - AC40TS - C2 ; Olympus , Japan ) 63 . All force curves and scanning field images ( 10 μ m × 10 μ m ) were recorded at a resolution of 128 × 128 pixels in Quantitative imaging ( QI ) mode at 37 °C . The maximum force and contact point determined by the vertical deflection of the cantilever was set to 0 . 5 nN , and the scan rates were automatically controlled by the Z length ( 1 μ m ) , extension time ( 15 ms ) and retraction time ( 15 ms ) . The force constant of the cantilever was 0 . 05 – 0 . 10 N / m . The force constant for each cantilever was calibrated using the thermal noise method 64 . The indentation of depth determined by the tip - sample separation at each set point was always smaller than 400 nm . The contact points were determined by calculating the point where the extending force curve crossed the baseline of vertical deflection . Young’s modulus of cells was examined using the force curve obtained by measuring the amount of cantilever deflection . The force curves were measured in the contact mode . The loading rate of the probe was 1 μ m / s . The force curve during the extension of the Z - piezo was used to determine the Young’s modulus of the cell . The data were processed by curve - fitting with the Hertz contact model using JPK data processing software . The geometric mean of Young’s modulus was calculated from the acquired Young’s modulus at each point of the cell for a given condition . Fluorescence images and force curve images were fitted by JPK data processing software and direct overlay software ( JPK ) . Fluorescent imaging of F - actin and vinculin in HUVECs . After stimulation with TNF - α and CBX , HUVECs were fixed by 4 % paraformaldehyde , and then permeabilized by 0 . 05 % tween in phosphate buffered saline . Actin were visualized using rhodamine - phalloidin ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . Vinculin were stained with anti - human vinculin monoclonal antibody ( Sigma ) and Alexa488 conjugated anti - mouse IgG antibody . Nuclei were stained using 4 ′ , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ( DAPI ) . HUVECs were observed using Zeiss fluorescence microscopy . The number of vinculin spots was analyzed by using ImageJ software ( US National Institutes of Health ) . This experiment was performed three times . Statistical analyses . Statistical tests between data pairs was carried out using a Student t - test , and differ - ences between the groups were analyzed by using Tukey’s test followed by one - way ANOVA or two - way ANOVA ; * P < 0 . 05 , * * P < 0 . 01 was considered statistically significant . www . nature . com / scientificreports / 10 SCientifiC RePORTS | 7 : 6134 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41598 - 017 - 06463 - x References 1 .
