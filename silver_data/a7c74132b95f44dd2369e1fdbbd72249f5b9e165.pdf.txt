Therefore , targeting other neuromodulatory systems represents an important therapeutic strategy . Among these , the locus coeruleus - noradrenaline system has been extensively implicated in response inhibition deficits . Restoring noradrenaline levels using the noradrenergic reuptake inhibitor atomoxetine can improve response inhibition in some patients with Parkinson’s disease , but there is considerable heterogeneity in treatment response . Accurately predicting the patients who would benefit from therapies targeting this neurotransmitter system remains a critical goal , in order to design the necessary clinical trials with stratified patient selection to establish the therapeutic potential of atomoxetine . Here , we test the hypothesis that integrity of the noradrenergic locus coeruleus explains the variation in improvement of response inhibition following atomoxetine . In a double - blind placebo - controlled randomised crossover design , 19 people with Parkinson’s disease completed an acute psychopharmacological challenge with 40 mg of oral atomoxetine or placebo . A stop - signal task was used to measure response inhibition , with stop - signal reaction times obtained through hierarchical Bayesian estimation of an ex - Gaussian race model . Twenty - six control subjects completed the same task without undergoing the drug manipulation . In a separate session , patients and controls underwent ultra - high field 7T imaging of the locus coeruleus using a neuromelanin - sensitive magnetisation transfer sequence . The principal result was that atomoxetine improved stop - signal reaction times in those patients with lower locus coeruleus integrity . This was in the context of a general impairment in response inhibition , as patients on placebo had longer stop - signal reaction times compared to controls . We also found that the caudal portion of the locus coeruleus showed the largest neuromelanin signal decrease in the patients compared to controls . Our results highlight a link between the integrity of the noradrenergic locus coeruleus and response inhibition in Parkinson’s disease patients . Furthermore , they demonstrate the importance of baseline noradrenergic state in determining the response to atomoxetine . We suggest that locus coeruleus neuromelanin imaging offers a marker of noradrenergic capacity that could be used to stratify patients in trials of noradrenergic therapy and to ultimately inform personalised treatment approaches . .

The mainstay dopaminergic therapies often fail to improve cognitive deficits , and in some cases can exacerbate them ( Cools et al . , 2003 ; Lewis et al . , 2005 ; Kehagia et al . , 2010 ) . This has prompted a shift of focus towards other neuromodulatory systems that are affected by Parkinson’s disease and related to cognitive decline , including noradrenaline ( Halliday et al . , 2014 ) . The noradrenergic locus coeruleus is one of the earliest sites of alpha - synuclein pathology ( Braak et al . , 2003 ; Surmeier et al . , 2017 ; Weinshenker , 2018 ) , and noradrenergic treatments have been shown to modulate cognitive functions that are impaired in Parkinson’s disease , including response inhibition ( Eagle et al . , 2008 ; Vazey and Aston - Jones , 2012 ; Kehagia et al . , 2014 ; Ye et al . , 2015 ; Rae et al . , 2016 ) . Response inhibition deficits are a well - documented feature of Parkinson’s disease , ranging from subclinical impairments to extreme impulsive behaviours ( Gauggel et al . , 2004 , Obeso et al . , 2011 a ; O’Callaghan et al . , 2013 ; Nombela et al . , 2014 ; Napier et al . , 2015 ) . Impulsivity is clear in the florid ‘impulse control disorders’ that are exacerbated by dopaminergic therapy ( Weintraub et al . , 2010 ) . However , milder impulsivity is common in the absence of an impulse control disorder , including impairments in the ability to cancel an inappropriate action . Neurodegeneration of fronto - striatal circuits , including the subthalamic nucleus and its inputs , contributes to this impairment in Parkinson’s disease ( O’Callaghan et al . , 2013 ; Jahanshahi et al . , 2014 ; Mosley et al . , 2019 ) , while pharmacological modulation of these circuits offers a tractable route to restorative treatment ( Marsh et al . , 2009 ; Kehagia et al . , 2014 ; Ye et al . , 2015 ; Rae et al . , 2016 ) . The locus coeruleus - noradrenaline system modulates the stimulus detection and behavioural re - orienting required for rapid action cancellation ( Robbins and Arnsten , 2009 ; Bari and Robbins , 2013 ) . Phasic activation in the locus coeruleus – the brain’s main source of noradrenaline – occurs in response to salient events , and its activity is tightly time - locked to task - relevant responses ( Aston - Jones and Cohen , 2005 ) . Highly collateralised projections from the locus coeruleus enable release of noradrenaline in multiple brain regions , altering the gain , or responsivity , of target neurons . The action of noradrenaline at multiple targets can interrupt and reconfigure network architecture , promoting a change in goal - directed behaviour ( Bouret and Sara , 2005 ; Zerbi et al . , 2019 ) . This locus coeruleus - noradrenaline function directly supports rapid action cancellation . In healthy adults and in preclinical models , .

Atomoxetine selectively inhibits presynaptic noradrenaline transporters , resulting in a three - fold increase in extracellular levels of noradrenaline in the prefrontal cortex ( Bymaster et al . , 2002 ) . It is currently licensed for treating behavioural and cognitive symptoms associated with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder . However , experimental psychopharmacological studies indicate it may be of value in some patients with Parkinson’s disease , by increasing activity and connectivity in the fronto - striatal ‘stopping network’ ( Chamberlain et al . , 2009 ; Bari et al . , 2011 ; Rae et al . , 2016 ) . The stopping network includes the inferior frontal gyrus and presupplementary motor area , and their excitatory connection with the subthalamic nucleus which , via the globus pallidus , increases inhibition over thalamocortical output ( Aron , 2011 ; Rae et al . , 2014 ) . Within this network , noradrenaline increases cortical excitability ( McGinley et al . , 2015 ) , functional connectivity ( Eldar et al . , 2013 ) and network integration ( Shine et al . , 2018 ) . The prefrontal regions also provide descending input to modulate the locus coeruleus ( Arnsten and Goldman - Rakic , 1984 ; Jodo et al . , 1998 ) , by which prefrontal noradrenaline can influence locus coeruleus activity . Atomoxetine alters locus coeruleus firing patterns to increase the phasic - to - tonic ratio , making the locus coeruleus more responsive to task - relevant stimuli ( Bari and Aston - Jones , 2013 ) . The potential for atomoxetine to modulate the locus coeruleus - noradrenaline function and improve response inhibition holds therapeutic promise in Parkinson’s disease . Previous work using stop - signal tasks in Parkinson’s disease demonstrated that atomoxetine can improve response inhibition and enhance its attendant stopping network activation ( Kehagia et al . , 2014 ; Ye et al . , 2015 , 2016 ; Rae et al . , 2016 ) . However , there was considerable heterogeneity in treatment response . To accurately predict the patients who would benefit from noradrenergic therapy remains a critical goal for atomoxetine treatment to be considered therapeutically and to design the necessary clinical trials with stratified patient selection ( Matthews et al . , 2014 ; Ye et al . , 2016 ) . Here , we test the hypothesis that structural integrity of the noradrenergic locus coeruleus explains the improvements in response inhibition following atomoxetine . This is now possible through recent developments in ultra - high field 7T imaging of the locus coeruleus ( Priovoulos .

We tested this hypothesis by combining quantification of the locus coeruleus by 7T MRI with an acute psychopharmacological challenge , and measuring response inhibition using the stop - signal reaction time . Methods Participants Nineteen people with idiopathic Parkinson’s disease were recruited via the University of Cambridge Parkinson’s disease research clinic and the Parkinson’s UK volunteer network . They met the United Kingdom Parkinson’s Disease Society Brain Bank criteria and were not demented based on MDS criteria for Parkinson’s disease dementia ( Emre et al . , 2007 ) nor on the mini - mental state examination ( score > 26 ) ( Martinez - Martin et al . , 2011 ) . They were aged between 50 - 80 years , with Hoehn and Yahr stages 1 . 5 - 3 , and had no contraindications to 7T MRI or atomoxetine . None had current impulse control disorders , based on clinical impression and the Questionnaire for Impulsive - Compulsive Disorders in Parkinson’s Disease ( QUIP - Current Short ) screening tool ( Weintraub et al . , 2009 ) . Levodopa equivalent daily dose ( LEDD ) scores were calculated ( Tomlinson et al . , 2010 ) . Twenty - six age - , sex - and education matched healthy controls were recruited from local volunteer panels . Control participants were screened for a history of neurological or psychiatric disorders , and no controls were using psychoactive medications . The study was approved by the local Ethics Committees and all participants provided written informed consent according to the Declaration of Helsinki . Demographic details and clinical characteristics are provided in Table 1 and the Supplementary Material . Study procedure Participants with Parkinson’s disease were tested across three sessions . Firstly , they underwent MRI scanning and clinical assessment , including the Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale ( MDS - UPDRS ; ( Goetz et al . , 2008 ) ) , mini - mental state examination ( MMSE ) , Montreal cognitive assessment ( MoCA ; ( Nasreddine et al . , 2005 ) ) and the revised Addenbrooke’s cognitive examination ( ACE - R ; ( Mioshi et al . , 2006 ) ) . On the second and third sessions , patients completed a double - blind randomised placebo - controlled crossover study , with 40 mg of oral atomoxetine or placebo . Drug / placebo order was randomly permuted in groups of six successive recruits . The visits were ≥ 6 days apart ( mean 7 . 4 days ; standard deviation 1 . 7 days ; range 6 - 14 days ) . Blood samples were taken two .

Mean plasma concentration ( Teichert et al . , 2020 ) was 261 . 32 ng / mL after atomoxetine ( standard deviation 117 . 33 ng / mL , range 90 . 92 - 595 . 11 ng / mL ) and 0 ng / mL after placebo . After the blood sample , patients commenced an experimental task battery that included a stop - signal response inhibition task . Supine / lying and upright blood pressure and pulse rate measures were monitored three times across the session ( on arrival , two hours post tablet administration , on completion of testing ) . To monitor any changes in subjective feelings following the drug / placebo , prior to tablet administration and two hours post , we administered a set of 16 visual analogue scales ( VAS ) rating current mood and arousal levels . All sessions and MRI scanning were conducted with patients on their regular anti - parkinsonian medications and at a similar time of day . Control participants were tested in one session to provide normative data on the task , in which they underwent MRI scanning and completed the same experimental task battery as the patients . The control group did not undergo the drug / placebo manipulation . Both the patient and control groups completed a set of self - and informant - rated questionnaires to assess mood and behaviour , which are reported in detail in the Supplementary Material . Stop - signal task We used a stop - signal task to measure response inhibition . This paradigm involves a two - choice reaction time ( RT ) ‘go’ task that is occasionally interrupted by a ‘stop signal’ , which requires the initiated response to be cancelled ( Figure 1A ) . On go trials , a left - or right - pointing black arrow was presented on the screen , and participants indicated its orientation by pressing a left or right response button . On stop trials , the arrow changed colour from black to red at the same time as a tone ( i . e . , the stop - signal ) , after a short and variable delay ( i . e . , the stop - signal delay , SSD ) . Participants were instructed to inhibit any imminent response if the arrow became red . The length of the SSD was varied across stop trials using a staircase method to target a stop accuracy of 50 % . The SSD ranged from 50 ms to 1500 ms and increased or decreased by 50 ms after a successful or failed stop trial , respectively . On no - go trials , the SSD was set to zero . The task consisted of 4 blocks of 140 trials each , including 110 go trials , 10 no - go trials ( very low commission error rate ) , and 20 stop trials per block ( approximately 50 % commission error rate ) . The first 20 trials of each block were go trials , to compute a starting value for the SSD ( mean RT minus 200 ms ) . The remaining trials within each block were pseudorandomly .

At the start of each trial , a fixation cross was presented for 500 ms . Participants were given standardised instructions at the start of the experiment . They were asked to respond as ‘quickly and accurately as possible’ , and were discouraged from strategically slowing down in anticipation of a stop signal ( Verbruggen et al . , 2019 ) . After these instructions , they were given a practice block of 25 trials ( 20 go trials , 2 no - go trials , and 3 stop trials ) . The experimenters verified that the participant understood the task , and if necessary the practice block was repeated . The practice data was not analysed further . Figure 1 . Design of the stop signal task ( A ) and ex - Gaussian race model of response inhibition ( B ) . ( A ) In the stop - signal go / no - go task , participants respond as quickly and accurately as possible to the direction of a black arrow ( go trials ) . Occasionally , this task is interrupted by a stop signal ( red arrow and beep tone ) , which requires any imminent response to be inhibited . For no - go trials , the stop signal is presented immediately after the fixation cross . For stop trials , the stop signal is presented after an initial go stimulus , with a short and variable delay . ( B ) The ex - Gaussian race model characterises task performance as a race between three competing processes or ‘runners’ : One stop process , and two go processes that match or mismatch the go stimulus . The finishing times of each process are assumed to follow an ex - Gaussian distribution . Successful inhibition in no - go or stop trials occurs when the stop process finishes before both go processes . A correct go response occurs when the matching go .

For simplicity , the finishing time distribution of the mismatching go process is not illustrated .

Ex - Gaussian race model of response inhibition We used a Bayesian parametric model of the stop - signal task to infer the latency of the unobservable stop response – the stop - signal reaction time ( SSRT ; ( Matzke et al . , 2013 , 2019 ) . This model assumes a race between three independent processes : one corresponding to the stop process , and two corresponding to go processes that match or mismatch the go stimulus ( Figure 1B ) . For a given stop trial , successful inhibition occurs when the stop process finishes before both go processes . For a given go trial , a correct response occurs when the matching go process finishes before the mismatching go process . The finish time distribution of the stop process is inferred by estimating the RT distribution of unsuccessful stop trials ( i . e . , signal respond RTs ) . Specifically , the signal respond RT distribution is assumed to be a right - censored go RT distribution , where the censoring point for a given stop trial is drawn from the finish time distribution of the stop process ( see ( Matzke et al . , 2013 ) for details ) . The model assumes that the finish times of the stop and go processes follow an ex - Gaussian distribution , which is a positively skewed unimodal distribution that is commonly used to describe RT data ( Ratcliff , 1979 ; Heathcote et al . , 1991 ) . Thus , for each process , we estimated the three parameters of the ex - Gaussian distribution : The mean μ and standard deviation σ of the Gaussian component , and the mean ( i . e . , inverse rate ) τ of the exponential component . We additionally estimated two parameters that represent the probability that the stop and go processes failed to start , referred to as “trigger failure” and “go failure” , respectively ( Matzke et al . , 2019 ) . These attentional failures are common in both healthy participants ( Matzke et al . , 2017 b ; Skippen et al . , 2019 ) and in clinical cohorts ( Matzke et al . , 2017 a ; Weigard et al . , 2019 ) , and if not modelled can severely bias estimation of the stop process ( Band et al . , 2003 ; Matzke et al . , 2019 ; Skippen et al . , 2019 ) . Prior to fitting the model , we removed implausibly short ( < 0 . 25 s ) or long ( > 4 . 5 s ) RTs , as well as go RTs more extreme than ±2 . 5 standard deviations from the participant’s mean ( Matzke et al . , 2013 ) . .

The parameters were estimated hierarchically , such that parameters for a given participant were sampled from corresponding group - level distributions . We fitted this hierarchical model separately for the control group , the Parkinson’s disease group on placebo , and the Parkinson’s disease group on atomoxetine . We placed the same set of prior distributions on the group - level parameters for each of these three groups . The prior distributions were identical to those suggested by the model developers ( Heathcote et al . , 2019 ) , except for slightly higher prior mean values for μ go - match ( 1 . 5 s ) , μ go - mismatch ( 1 . 5 s ) and μ stop ( 1 s ) , to account for slower RT in older age ( see Supplemental Material for full list of priors ) . The model MCMC sampling initially ran with 33 chains ( i . e . , three times the number of parameters ) , with thinning of every 10th sample and a 5 % probability of migration . Model convergence was assessed with the potential scale reduction statistic 𝑅 " ( < 1 . 1 for all parameters ) , and with visual inspection of the time - series plots of the chains . After this , an additional 500 iterations for each chain were run to create a final posterior distribution for each parameter . To assess the model’s goodness of fit , the observed data was compared to simulated data generated from the model’s posterior predictive distribution ( see Supplementary Material Figures 4 - 6 ) . The primary outcome of interest , SSRT , was computed as the mean of the ex - Gaussian finish time distribution of the stop process , which is given by μ stop + τ stop . We repeated this for each MCMC sample to approximate a posterior distribution of SSRT . This approach was also used to approximate a posterior distribution of go RT ( μ go - match + τ go - match ) . Statistical analysis The go error rate and stop accuracy rate served as basic descriptive statistics for stop - signal task performance . We defined the go error rate as the proportion of go trials with an incorrect response , including commission errors ( responses that mismatch the arrow direction ) and omission errors ( missing responses ) . The stop accuracy rate was defined as the proportion of stop trials with successfully inhibited responses ( missing responses ) . For both outcomes , we examined differences between groups ( Parkinson’s disease placebo vs . controls ) and drug conditions ( Parkinson’s disease placebo vs . atomoxetine ) using independent and paired samples t - tests respectively . .

For group - level inference , we examined the posterior distributions of the group - level means of SSRT and go RT . For a given posterior distribution , we took the median as the posterior estimate , and the 95 % quantile interval ( QI ) as the range of most credible values . We also obtained posterior distributions for contrasts of interest ( Parkinson’s disease placebo vs . controls ; Parkinson’s disease placebo vs . atomoxetine ) by subtracting the sets of MCMC samples of the two groups under consideration . That is , for a given parameter , we computed the difference between the two groups for each MCMC sample , thereby yielding an approximate posterior distribution of the difference ( Kruschke , 2013 ) . To test for individual differences in the effect of atomoxetine on SSRT and go RT , we extracted the medians of the participant - level posterior distributions of SSRT and go RT from the placebo and atomoxetine model fits . We hypothesised that the effect of atomoxetine would depend on the integrity of the locus coeruleus , indexed by the contrast - to - noise ratio ( CNR ; described below ) . Therefore , the posterior parameter estimates were entered as the dependent variable with drug condition ( placebo vs . atomoxetine ) , CNR , and their interaction as fixed effects , allowing the intercept to vary across participants ( random effect ) . We additionally included a fixed effect of session ( first vs . second ) as a covariate of no interest . Taking the analysis of SSRT as an example , the model was specified in R formula syntax as follows : SSRT ~ drug * CNR + session + ( 1 | subject ) . For linear models , we report both frequentist and Bayes factor ( BF ) analyses for hypothesis testing , with a significance threshold of p = . 05 ( two - sided ) for frequentist analyses . We present the BF for the alternative hypothesis over the null hypothesis ( i . e . , BF 10 ) , such that BF > 1 indicates relative evidence for the alternative hypothesis , and BF > 3 indicates “positive evidence” for the alternative hypothesis ( Kass and Raftery , 1995 ) . All BF analyses used the default ‘JZS’ prior on the effect size under the alternative hypothesis ( Rouder et al . , 2009 , 2012 ) . To test for specific fixed effects in linear mixed models , we obtained p - values using the Kenward - Roger method , and BFs through Bayesian model averaging by estimating the change from prior to posterior inclusion odds ( inclusion BF ) . In other words , this model - averaged BF indicates how much more likely the data are under model variants that include a given fixed effect , compared to model variants that exclude the fixed effect ( Hinne et al . , 2020 ) . .

We nevertheless included these two participants in the linear mixed model analyses of the within - subject effect of atomoxetine , as participants were treated as a random effect . However , excluding these two participants did not meaningfully change any of the following results . Software and Equipment The stop - signal task was implemented in MATLAB R2018b using the Psychophysics Toolbox extensions ( Version 3 ; ( Kleiner et al . , 2007 ) ) . Participants responded using a two - button response box . The ex - Gaussian model fitting was performed with the Dynamic Models of Choice toolbox ( Heathcote et al . , 2019 ) , implemented in R ( version 3 . 6 . 1 , R Core Team , 2019 ) . Further statistical analyses in R used the ‘tidyverse’ ( Wickham et al . , 2019 ) and ‘tidybayes’ ( Kay , 2020 ) packages for data organisation and visualisation , the ‘afex’ package ( Singmann et al . , 2020 ) for ANOVA and linear mixed model fitting with the ‘emmeans’ package ( Lenth et al . , 2020 ) used for post hoc comparisons , and the ‘BayesFactor’ ( Morey et al . , 2018 ) and ‘bayestestR’ ( Makowski et al . , 2019 ) packages for Bayes Factor analysis . MRI acquisition All patients and controls underwent MR imaging . Two controls were excluded from further imaging analysis due to incidental structural abnormalities . MR images were acquired with a 7T Magnetom Terra scanner ( Siemens , Erlangen , Germany ) , using a 32 - channel receive and circularly polarised single - channel transmit head coil ( Nova Medical , Wilmington , USA ) . We used a 3 - D high - resolution magnetisation transfer - weighted turbo flash ( MT - TFL ) sequence for imaging the locus coeruleus ( based on ( Priovoulos et al . , 2018 ) ) . 112 axial slices were used to cover both the midbrain and the pontine regions . The sequence applied a train of 20 Gaussian - shape RF - pulses at 6 . 72 ppm off resonance , 420º flip - angle , followed by a turbo - flash readout ( TE = 4 . 08 ms , TR = 1251 ms , flip - angle = 8° , voxel size = 0 . 4 x 0 . 4 x 0 . 5 mm 3 , 6 / 8 phase and slice partial Fourier , bandwidth = 140 Hz / px , no acceleration , 14 . 3 % - oversampling , TA ~ 7 min ) . For each subject , the transmit voltage was adjusted based on the average flip angle in the central area of the pons obtained from a B1 pre - calibration scan . The MT - TFL sequence was repeated twice and averaged offline to improve signal - to - noise ratio . An additional scan ( MT - off ) was acquired with the same parameters as above but without the off - resonance pulses . A high resolution isotropic T1 - weighted ( T1 - w ) MP2RAGE image was also acquired sagittally for anatomical coregistration using the UK7T Network harmonised .

Image processing and coregistration pipeline Image processing and coregistration was based on the pipeline described in ( Ye et al . , 2020 ) . The Advanced Normalization Tools ( ANTs v2 . 2 . 0 ) software and in - house Matlab scripts were used for image pre - processing and the standardisation of MT images . MT images were first N4 bias field corrected for spatial inhomogeneity ( number of iterations at each resolution level : 50x50x30x20 , convergence threshold : 1x10 - 6 , isotropic sizing for b - spline fitting : 200 ) ( Tustison et al . , 2010 ) then averaged using the customised antsMultivariateTemplateConstruction2 function for improvements in signal - to - noise ratio . The T1 - w MP2RAGE data were generated offline from the complex images ( Clarke et al . , 2020 ) . T1 - w skull - stripped images were obtained after tissue type segmentation and reconstruction using SPM12 ( v7219 ) ( http : / / www . fil . ion . ucl . ac . uk / spm / software / spm12 / ) . The pre - processed MT - weighted and T1 - w images were then entered into a T1 - driven , cross modality coregistration pipeline to warp the individual MT and MT - off images to the isotropic 0 . 5 mm ICBM152 ( International Consortium for Brain Mapping ) T1 - w asymmetric template ( Fonov et al . , 2011 ) . The individual T1 - w images were first coregistered to the MT image with rigid only transformation . The MT - off image was used as the intermediate step for bridging the two modalities because the MT - off image shares similar tissue - specific contrasts with both T1 - w MP2RAGE and MT - on images . In parallel , an unbiased study - wise T1 - w structural template was created using individual skull - stripped T1 - w images from all controls and patients . Native T1 - w images were rigid and affine transformed , followed by a hierarchical nonlinear diffeomorphic step at five levels of resolution , repeated by six runs to improve convergence . Max iterations for each resolution from the coarsest level to the full resolution were 100x100x70x50x20 ( shrink factors : 10x6x4x2x1 , smoothing factors : 5x3x2x1x0 voxels , gradient step size : 0 . 1 mm ) . The Greedy Symmetric Normalisation ( SyN ) was adopted for the transformation model of the deformation step ( Avants et al . , 2008 ) . The resulting T1 - w group template was then registered to the standard ICBM152 T1 - w brain following the similar rigid - affine - SyN steps at four resolution levels ( max iterations : 100x70x50x50 , convergence threshold : 1x10 - 6 , shrink factors : 8x4x2x1 , .

For all the above registration steps , cross - correlation was used for similarity metrics estimation as it performs better for linear and non - linear components during intra - modality registration . Four steps of deformations were estimated as follows ( in order ) : MT - off to MT , T1 - w to MT - off , T1 - w to T1 - w group template and T1 - w group template to ICBM152 T1 - w template . These parameters were then used as the roadmap for MT image standardisation to the ICBM brain in one step . A trilinear interpolation method was selected to preserve the absolute location and relative contrast of the signal . Independent probabilistic locus coeruleus atlas creation To facilitate accurate extraction of the locus coeruleus signal we created a study - specific unbiased locus coeruleus atlas ( See Figure 2A ) . To do this , we used an independent sample of 29 age - and education matched healthy controls ( 13 female ; age mean ( SD ) = 67 ( 8 . 2 ) , age range = 52 - 84 ) collected under the same neuroimaging protocol . We used a validated pipeline for locus coeruleus atlas construction described in ( Ye et al . , 2020 ) . Briefly , for each axial slice on the rostrocaudal extent , the locations of the left and right locus coeruleus were determined using a semi - automated segmentation method . A threshold was defined as five standard deviations above the mean intensity in the central pontine reference region . After applying the threshold , locus coeruleus voxels on axial planes were automatically segmented into binarised images then averaged to construct a probabilistic atlas . The independent locus coeruleus atlas generated for this study had very high similarity in the spatial distribution of probabilities and contours relative to the validated 7T locus coeruleus atlas in ( Ye et al . , 2020 ) ( See Supplementary Figure 1 ) . Locus coeruleus signal extraction As a measure of locus coeruleus integrity , we quantified contrast by establishing the CNR with respect to a reference region in the central pons ( see Figure 2A ) . A CNR map was computed voxel - by - voxel on the average MT image for each subject using the signal difference between a given voxel ( V ) and the mean intensity in the reference region ( Mean REF ) divided by the standard deviation ( SD REF ) of the reference signals ( 𝐶𝑁𝑅 = ’ ( ) * + , - . / 01 - . / ) . CNR values were extracted bilaterally on the CNR map by applying the independent locus coeruleus probabilistic atlas ( 5 % probability version ) . We computed mean CNR values for the rostral , middle and caudal portions of the left and right locus coeruleus . As an index of locus coeruleus integrity .

Results Behavioural results As shown in Table 1 , the patient and control groups were matched in terms of age , years of education , sex ratio , MMSE and MoCA ( all p values > . 050 ; all BFs < 1 ) . Patients had a significantly lower ACE - R total score ( p = . 015 , BF = 4 . 16 ) , and lower memory subscale ( p = . 013 , BF = 7 . 00 ) . There were no group differences on any of the self - reported questionnaires assessing impulsivity , anxiety , depression and behavioural measures , with the exception of the Motivation and Energy Inventory where the patient group had significantly lower scores for the physical subscale compared to controls ( p = . 010 , BF = 6 . 18 ; Supplementary Material Table 1 ) . Within the drug and placebo sessions , there was some evidence of increased pulse rates and raised blood pressure on atomoxetine , although this was not considered clinically relevant and was not consistently observed across all supine and upright measures . Importantly , there was no change in subjective ratings of mood and arousal levels within the sessions . These analyses are described in detail in the Supplementary Material . .

There was a significant group by subdivision interaction ( F ( 1 . 27 , 52 . 22 ) = 7 . 89 , p = 004 ; BF = 32 . 98 ) .

Stop - signal task performance In keeping with the tracking algorithm , the stop accuracy for the Parkinson’s disease group on placebo ( Figure 3A ; M = 0 . 48 , SD = 0 . 15 ) was not significantly different from controls ( M = 0 . 58 , SD = 0 . 18 ; t ( 40 . 79 ) = 1 . 90 , p = . 065 , BF = 0 . 35 ) . Across the Parkinson’s disease patients , group - wise stop accuracy on atomoxetine ( M = 0 . 45 , SD = 0 . 13 ) was not significantly different from the placebo session ( t ( 16 ) = 0 . 88 , p = . 39 , BF = 0 . 35 ) . The go error rate approached zero for most participants , yielding a skewed distribution bounded at zero ( Figure 3D ) , and was therefore logit transformed prior to analysis ( Warton and Hui , 2011 ) . The logit go error rate was slightly higher in the Parkinson’s disease group on placebo ( M = - 4 . 29 , SD = 1 . 23 ) than in controls ( M = - 5 . 04 , SD = 0 . 93 ; t ( 29 . 94 ) = - 2 . 19 , p = . 037 , BF = 0 . 46 ) . Within the Parkinson’s disease group , the logit go error rate was marginally reduced on atomoxetine ( M = - 4 . 75 , SD = 1 . 22 ) compared to placebo ( t ( 16 ) = 2 . 23 , p = . 041 , BF = 1 . 73 ) . However , we note that the BF for both these tests fell below conventional thresholds for positive evidence ( i . e . , BF > 3 ) , and these effects on go error rate should therefore be regarded as ‘anecdotal’ at the group level .

The stop process finish times tended to be faster for the control group than the Parkinson’s disease group . Indeed , the posterior distribution of group - level mean SSRT ( Figure 3C ) was lower for the control group ( median = 0 . 39 s , 95 % QI : [ 0 . 36 , 0 . 41 ] ) than the Parkinson’s disease group on placebo ( median = 0 . 46 s , 95 % QI : [ 0 . 41 , 0 . 52 ] ) , and this group difference in SSRT was reliably different from zero ( ∆group median = 0 . 07 s , 95 % QI : [ 0 . 01 , 0 . 14 ] ) . The mean SSRT for the Parkinson’s disease group on atomoxetine ( median = 0 . 47 s , 95 % QI : [ 0 . 42 , 0 . 52 ] ) was comparable to the placebo session ( ∆drug median = 0 . 01 s , 95 % QI : [ - 0 . 07 , 0 . 09 ] ) . For the matching go process , the distributions of finish times varied widely across participants , but the group - level distributions were highly similar . The posterior distributions of group - level mean go RT ( Figure 3F ) did not differ between the control group ( median = 1 . 05 s , 95 % QI : [ 0 . 28 , 1 . 46 ] ) , Parkinson’s disease group on placebo ( median = 0 . 98 s , 95 % QI : [ 0 . 37 , 1 . 31 ] ; ∆group median = - 0 . 07 s , 95 % QI : [ - 0 . 78 , 0 . 77 ] ) , and Parkinson’s disease group on atomoxetine ( median = 0 . 97 s , 95 % QI : [ 0 . 30 , 1 . 34 ] ; ∆drug median = - 0 . 01 s , 95 % QI : [ - 0 . 72 , 0 . 67 ] ) .

Locus coeruleus integrity and atomoxetine - induced changes in SSRT Although there was no group - wise effect of atomoxetine on the Parkinson’s disease group in terms of their mean SSRT , we predicted that the effect of atomoxetine would depend on individual differences in locus coeruleus integrity , as indexed by the CNR . We confirmed a significant interaction effect between the drug condition and locus coeruleus CNR on the participant - level estimates of SSRT ( Figure 4A ; β = 0 . 27 , F ( 1 , 14 . 61 ) = 14 . 61 , p = . 002 ; BF = 11 . 56 ) . This interaction effect did not meaningfully change when including clinical covariates such as age , disease severity , atomoxetine plasma level and dopaminergic medication , as both frequentist and Bayesian model selection procedures indicated that such covariates did not significantly improve the model fit ( for details see Supplementary Material ) .

There were no significant main effects of drug condition ( β = - 0 . 05 , F ( 1 , 14 . 21 ) = 0 . 70 , p = . 416 ; BF = 0 . 37 ) or locus coeruleus CNR ( β = 0 . 11 , F ( 1 , 14 . 61 ) = 0 . 266 , p = . 613 ; BF = 0 . 55 ) on SSRT . To further understand the drug × locus coeruleus CNR interaction , we examined the relationship between locus coeruleus CNR and the drug - induced change in SSRT ( ∆drug : atomoxetine - placebo ) , adjusted for the main effect of session . This relationship was strongly positive , suggesting that patients with lower locus coeruleus CNR have a greater reduction in SSRT after atomoxetine ( Figure 4B ; r ( 15 ) = 0 . 73 , p < . 001 ; BF = 32 . 70 ) . There was no interaction effect between drug condition and locus coeruleus CNR on the participant - level estimates of go RT ( β = 0 . 01 , F ( 1 , 16 . 37 ) = 0 . 00 , p = . 971 ; BF = 0 . 47 ) , stop accuracy rate ( β = - 0 . 18 , F ( 1 , 16 . 52 ) = 1 . 15 , p = . 300 ; BF = 0 . 58 ) , or logit go error rate ( β = - 0 . 02 , F ( 1 , 15 . 14 ) = 0 . 03 , p = . 865 ; BF = 0 . 46 ) .

Following a single dose of atomoxetine 40 mg , individuals with lower locus coeruleus integrity had a greater improvement in response inhibition ( i . e . , reduction in their stop - signal reaction time ; SSRT ) . This result highlights the link between integrity of the noradrenergic locus coeruleus and action cancellation , which has previously been inferred from preclinical work and pharmacological manipulations . The finding also demonstrates the importance of baseline noradrenergic capacity in determining the response to atomoxetine , confirming the need to stratify patients for noradrenergic therapy . Locus coeruleus neuromelanin imaging would be a safe and affordable means to achieve this stratification . Previous work in Parkinson’s disease showed that atomoxetine led to greater improvements in SSRT and enhanced activation in the stopping network in patients with more severe disease ( Ye et al . , 2015 ; Rae et al . , 2016 ) . Extending this work , we confirm that improved SSRTs under atomoxetine occurred in those patients with more severe locus coeruleus degeneration . This was in the context of a general impairment in response inhibition , as patients on placebo had longer SSRTs compared to controls . Our result suggests that a single 40 mg atomoxetine dose confers most benefit on individuals with a severe loss of noradrenergic capacity . In this way , noradrenergic replacement in patients with a compromised system may achieve restoration closer to normal levels and improve behaviour . Conversely , in patients with a less affected system the same dose may offer no appreciable benefit or even ‘overdose’ the system , leading to worse behaviour . This relationship is captured by the inverted - U shaped curve ( known as a Yerkes - Dodson function ) that is common across monoaminergic and cholinergic systems , whereby intermediate levels of neuromodulatory influence are associated with optimal performance , with too much or too little having deleterious effects on behaviour ( Robbins , 2000 ; Aston - Jones and Cohen , 2005 ) . Baseline dependency in dose - response curves is well documented in relation to dopaminergic therapy ( Rowe et al . , 2008 ; Cools and D’Esposito , 2011 ) , such that the optimal level of dopamine enhancement needed to improve behaviour depends on pre - existing dopamine levels . This has had critical implications for Parkinson’s disease therapy . Dopamine dosages titrated to restore levels in the severely depleted dorsal striatum and motor system circuitry effectively overdose the less affected ventral tegmental area , ventral striatum and associated .

Our result suggests a similar baseline dependency for noradrenergic therapy , where optimal dosages needed for atomoxetine therapy may depend on the extent of degeneration in the locus coeruleus . This has important implications for optimising noradrenergic therapy in Parkinson’s disease , as patients could be stratified based on locus coeruleus integrity to inform appropriate dosages in clinical trials or personalised treatment ( Ye et al . , 2016 ) . Neuromelanin - sensitive magnetisation transfer imaging of the locus coeruleus represents a promising avenue to achieve this stratification . Although we have previously shown a relationship between disease severity ( as measured by the UPDRS - III ) and atomoxetine responsivity , such measures of motor function or disease duration may not be the most accurate measure of noradrenergic capacity . Whilst progressive degeneration of the locus coeruleus is expected over the disease course , this will vary widely across individuals and will reflect the disease phenotype . Neuropathological studies and neuromelanin imaging have shown more pronounced locus coeruleus degeneration in certain phenotypes , including those with cognitive impairment or dementia ( Cash et al . , 1987 ; Zweig et al . , 1993 ; Li et al . , 2019 ) , depression ( Wang et al . , 2018 ) , an akinetic - rigid syndrome ( Paulus and Jellinger , 1991 ) and REM sleep behaviour disorder ( García - Lorenzo et al . , 2013 ; Sommerauer et al . , 2017 ) , relative to patients at equivalent disease stages . In our results we note that including the MDS - UPDRS - III as an index of disease severity did not meaningfully improve the model fit for the interaction between the drug condition and locus coeruleus CNR . This highlights the added value of locus coeruleus imaging , above and beyond disease severity metrics , to explain variations in atomoxetine responsivity . Our locus coeruleus imaging identified that the greatest difference between controls and patients was in the caudal portion of the locus coeruleus . This has not previously been identified in Parkinson’s disease locus coeruleus imaging with 3T MRI , which limited analysis to the whole structure . While some neuropathology studies have noted comparable cell loss across the rostral - caudal extent of the locus coeruleus ( Chan‐Palay and Asan , 1989 ; German et al . , 1992 ) , others have reported more severe degenerative changes in the caudal segment ( Bertrand et al . , 1997 ) . .

In the prefrontal cortex , atomoxetine may also increase extracellular dopamine levels ( Bymaster et al . , 2002 ) . Due to the relative sparsity of dopamine transporters in the prefrontal cortex ( Sesack et al . , 1998 ) , a portion of dopamine uptake is mediated by the noradrenaline transporter ( Wayment et al . , 2001 ; Seamans and Yang , 2004 ) . Therefore , improved response inhibition under atomoxetine in Parkinson’s disease might potentially also reflect elevated prefrontal dopamine levels . Nevertheless , work in both rodents and humans implicates a selective link between noradrenergic transmission and action cancellation : increasing dopamine selectively does not affect the SSRT ( Overtoom et al . , 2003 ; Bari et al . , 2009 , Obeso et al . , 2011 b ) . The association we have shown between locus coeruleus integrity and the change in SSRT under atomoxetine suggests a direct link between the noradrenergic system and action cancellation in Parkinson’s disease . Our results do not speak directly to atomoxetine’s mechanism of action in Parkinson’s disease . However , convergent evidence indicates that atomoxetine may increase efficiency in brain networks mediating response inhibition , via actions at the prefrontal cortex and the locus coeruleus ( Bymaster et al . , 2002 ; Bari and Aston - Jones , 2013 ) . In Parkinson’s disease patients , atomoxetine has been shown to increase activity within and between regions of the stopping network , including the pre - supplementary motor area and inferior frontal gyrus ( Ye et al . , 2015 ; Rae et al . , 2016 ) . Locus coeruleus degeneration in Parkinson’s disease is accompanied by reduced noradrenaline levels in forebrain regions ( Scatton et al . , 1983 ; Cash et al . , 1987 ; Pifl et al . , 2012 ) . As noradrenaline release facilitates reconfigurations of large - scale networks ( Bouret and Sara , 2005 ; Zerbi et al . , 2019 ) , depletion of forebrain noradrenaline is likely to impact the rapid engagement of brain network activity that is necessary for successful action cancellation ( Tsvetanov et al . , 2018 ) . In patients with greater locus coeruleus degeneration , which may be accompanied by decreased or dysfunctional modulation of prefrontal noradrenergic targets , efficiency of the stopping network may be reduced . Consequently , these patients show the greatest benefit from a drug that can increase levels of prefrontal noradrenaline and upregulate locus coeruleus function . Given the role of noradrenaline in cognition and behaviour ( Sara , 2009 ) , noradrenergic dysfunction contributes to cognitive deficits beyond action cancellation in Parkinson’s disease . .

Our results confirm the potential for stratified noradrenergic therapy in Parkinson’s disease , whereby the efficacy of these drugs varies across individuals depending on their baseline noradrenergic state . Locus coeruleus neuromelanin imaging may offer a marker of noradrenergic capacity that can be used to stratify patients to optimise successful outcomes in trials of noradrenergic therapy , and ultimately inform a more personalised treatment approach . .
