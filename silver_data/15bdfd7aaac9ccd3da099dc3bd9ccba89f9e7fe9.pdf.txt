Methods : Residual sera from 177 24 symptomatic COVID - 19 positive patients , and 163 non - COVID - 19 patients were tested for 25 antibody with the Abbott SARS - CoV - 2 IgG assay ( Abbott Diagnostics , Chicago , US ) . 26 Clinical records for COVID - 19 patients were reviewed to determine the time from onset of 27 clinical illness to testing . Results : Specificity of the assay was 100 . 0 % ( 95 % CI : 97 . 1 – 28 100 . 0 % ) . The clinical sensitivity of the assay varied depending on time from onset of 29 symptoms , increasing with longer periods since onset of clinical illness . The clinical 30 sensitivity at ≤ 6 days was 8 . 6 % ( 7 / 81 ; 95 % CI : 3 . 8 – 17 . 5 % ) , 7 - 13 days : 43 . 6 % ( 17 / 39 ; 95 % 31 CI : 28 . 2 – 60 . 2 % ) , 14 - 20 days : 84 . 0 % ( 21 / 25 ; 95 % CI : 63 . 1 – 94 . 7 % ) , and ≥ 21 days : 84 . 4 % 32 ( 27 / 32 ; 95 % CI : 66 . 5 – 94 . 1 % ) . Clinical sensitivity was higher in the ≥ 14 days group 33 compared to < 14 . There were no differences between the 14 - 20 days and ≥ 21 days group ; the 34 combined clinical sensitivity for these groups ( ≥ 14 days ) was 84 . 2 % ( 49 / 57 ; 71 . 6 – 92 . 1 % ) . 35 Conclusion : The Abbott SARS - CoV - 2 IgG test has high specificity . Clinical sensitivity was 36 limited in early stages of disease but improved from 14 days after onset of clinical infection . 37 38 Introduction 39 Coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) continues to spread globally , and laboratory 40 confirmation of SARS - CoV - 2 is of paramount importance in the efforts to combat this 41 pandemic . Testing and turnaround time may vary from a few hours to days taking into 42 consideration the workload and throughput of analyzers in operation . 43 44 There is interest in developing other testing modalities for confirmation of diagnosis such as 45 antigen testing and serological assays [ 1 ] . SARS - CoV - 2 antibody response may comprise of 46 immunoglobulin A ( IgA ) , immunoglobulin M ( IgM ) , and / or immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) . Long 47 and colleagues have reported that in a cohort of 70 patients that the proportion of patients 48 with a positive IgG reached 100 % after 17 - 19 days of symptoms , as tested on a magnetic 49 chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay [ 2 ] . Nevertheless , questions remains regarding 50 clinical utility of serology testing as a diagnostic tool . In this study , we aimed to test the 51 Abbott Architect SARS - CoV - 2 IgG on our Abbott Architect i4000SR analyzer , which has a 52 throughput of 400 tests per hour . A cohort of positive COVID - 19 patients’ residual sera were 53 utilized for testing , and we established the clinical sensitivity and specificity of the assay to 54 determine the utility of SARS - CoV - 2 IgG detection . 55 56 Methods : 57 We prospectively identified confirmed COVID - 19 patients presenting to and admitted to our 58 institution from 30 th of March 2020 to 15 th of May 2020 . Patients were selected on the basis 59 of a positive SARS - CoV - 2 rRT - PCR from a respiratory sample . Residual sera were collected 60 from this cohort and stored for serological testing . Samples were handled in strict accordance 61 to the WHO biosafety precautions as previously described [ 3 ] . Two PCR assays were used 62 during this time period ( Fortitude , MirXES , Singapore and cobas® SARS - COV - 2 , Roche 63 Diagnostics , USA ) . Only unique or non - duplicate patients were included and stratified into 64 four groups based on day - of - illness ( ≤ 6 days , 7 - 13 days , 14 - 20 days , and ≥ 21 days ) . Clinical 65 records for COVID - 19 patients were reviewed to determine the time from onset of clinical 66 illness to testing . All patients had respiratory symptoms and / or fever . Patients who were 67 asymptomatic at time of PCR testing for contact screening purposes could not be stratified 68 according to time from onset - of - illness and were excluded . A repository of negative controls 69 were utilized with samples taken from patients prior to December 2019 . These include 70 patients with and without other positive serological tests ( anti - extractable nuclear antigen 71 antibodies [ 9 ] ; anti - glomerular basement membrane antibodies [ 4 ] ; anti - smooth muscle 72 antibody [ 3 ] ; hepatitis A IgM [ 3 ] ; Epstein - barr virus IgM [ 3 ] ; anti - intrinsic factor [ 5 ] ; 73 cytomegalovirus IgM [ 4 ] ; cytomegalovirus IgG [ 3 ] ; Syphillis Treponoma pallidum antibody 74 [ 5 ] ; hepatitis B E Antigen [ 2 ] ; Epstein - barr virus IgA [ 7 ] ; Leptospira IgM [ 3 ] ; hepatitis C [ 9 ] ; 75 hepatitis B surface antigen [ 7 ] ; anti - double strand DNA [ 3 ] ; rubella IgM [ 4 ] ; ANA [ 3 ] ; 76 hepatitis A IgG [ 3 ] ; dengue IgG [ 1 ] ; varicella zoster IgM [ 1 ] ; human immunodeficiency virus 77 [ 8 ] ; varicella zoster virus IgG [ 6 ] . All samples were collected in Serum Separator Tubes 78 ( Beckton Dickinson , New Jersey , USA ) and Abbott SARS - CoV - 2 IgG assay was performed 79 on the Abbott Architect i4000SR ( Abbott Diagnostics , Chicago , US ) as per manufacturer’s 80 instructions . The assay is a chemiluminescent immunoassay which detects IgG raised against 81 the nucleocapsid protein of SARS - COV - 2 . A Signal / Cut - off ( S / CO ) ratio of ≥ 1 . 4 was 82 interpreted as reactive and a S / CO ratio of < 1 . 4 was interpreted as non - reactive . Calibration 83 was performed and positive quality control ( QC ) S / CO 1 . 65 - 8 . 40 and negative quality control 84 S / CO ≤ 0 . 78 were fulfilled prior to analyses of patient samples . Within day imprecision 85 assessment was performed using QC material . Clinical sensitivity was determined using the 86 SARS - CoV - 2 PCR as the reference standard . For determining clinical specificity and cross - 87 reactivity , negative samples collected prior to December 2019 were assumed to be negative 88 as SARS - CoV - 2 was first identified late 2019 , and the first patients in Singapore were 89 identified in January 2020 . Further analysis of sensitivity and specificity was performed by 90 varying the S / CO ratio cut - off . Results were analyzed using Microsoft Excel 2018 and the 91 Statistical Package for Social Sciences ( SPSS ) . Our study was reviewed and approved by the 92 National Healthcare Group Domain Specific Review Board which provides ethical review for 93 our institution ( NHG ROAM Reference Number : 2020 / 00337 ) . 94 95 Results : 96 Within - day imprecision using negative QC material ( n = 20 ) on the Architect i4000SR had a 97 mean S / CO of 0 . 059 – 0 . 060 , with a coefficient of variation ( CV ) of 0 . 0 % to 5 . 4 % . Positive 98 QC material ( n = 20 ) had a mean S / CO of 3 . 332 - 3 . 432 , with a CV of 0 . 9 % to 2 . 9 % . This was 99 within the manufacturer’s CV claims of 1 . 1 - 5 . 9 % . 100 A total of 177 samples from COVID - 19 patients , and 163 samples from non - COVID - 19 101 patients were included . All 163 samples from non - COVID - 19 patients were negative ; the 102 clinical specificity of the assay was 100 . 0 % ( 95 % CI : 97 . 1 – 100 . 0 % ) . The clinical sensitivity 103 of the assay varied depending on time from onset of symptoms , increasing with longer 104 periods since onset of clinical illness . The clinical sensitivity at ≤ 6 days was 8 . 6 % ( 7 / 81 ; 95 % 105 CI : 3 . 8 – 17 . 5 % ) , 7 - 13 days : 43 . 6 % ( 17 / 39 ; 95 % CI : 28 . 2 – 60 . 2 % ) , 14 - 20 days : 84 . 0 % 106 ( 21 / 25 ; 95 % CI : 63 . 1 – 94 . 7 % ) , and ≥ 21 days : 84 . 4 % ( 27 / 32 ; 95 % CI : 66 . 5 – 94 . 1 % ) . 107 Clinical sensitivity was higher in the ≥ 14 days group compared to < 14 . There were no 108 differences between the 14 - 20 days and ≥ 21 days group ; the combined clinical sensitivity for 109 these groups ( ≥ 14 days ) was 84 . 2 % ( 49 / 57 ; 71 . 6 – 92 . 1 % ) . 110 111 The S / CO values are summarized in Table 1 . The maximum S / CO detected for negative cases 112 was 0 . 70 . The clinical sensitivity was calculated again using S / CO of 1 . 0 and 0 . 8 for 113 classifying reactive vs non - reactive results . These are summarized in Table 2 . At a cut - off of 114 1 . 0 , additional cases would be interpreted as reactive in the ≥ 21 days group ( two samples ) , 7 - 115 13 days group ( two samples ) , and ≤ 6 days ( one sample ) . At a cut - off of 0 . 8 , additional cases 116 would be interpreted as reactive in the ≥ 21 days group ( two samples ) , 7 - 13 days group ( three 117 samples ) , and ≤ 6 days ( one sample ) . A one - way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) was 118 conducted to compare the mean levels of SARS - CoV - 2 IgG S / CO between groups , and this 119 showed a significant difference amongst the different days of symptoms for the positive 120 COVID - 19 patients [ F ( 3 , 170 ) = 38 . 44 , p < 0 . 001 ] . Post - hoc comparisons using the Tukey 121 Honest Significant Test ( HSC ) indicated that there was no significant difference ( p = 0 . 839 ) 122 in mean S / CO IgG levels in patients with ≥ 21 days ( mean = 4 . 74 , SD = 2 . 85 ) as compared to 123 patients with 14 - 20 days of symptom ( mean = 5 . 29 , SD = 2 . 71 ) . Nevertheless , the mean 124 S / CO values were significantly lower in the 7 - 13 days group ( p < 0 . 001 ) and ≤ 6 days ( p < 125 0 . 001 ) as compared to the 14 - 20 days group . This implies that 14 days of symptoms is a 126 suitable timepoint to consider for testing SARS - CoV - 2 IgG antibodies , and that any fewer 127 days of symptoms would result in significantly lower S / COs , and false - negative results are 128 more likely . 129 130 Discussion 131 Our results demonstrated limited clinical sensitivity of the IgG assay , particularly in the 132 earlier stages of illness . IgG testing is not suitable for laboratory diagnosis in acute disease , 133 but is considered for retrospective testing for epidemiological purposes , if there is suspicion 134 of false - positive or false - negative PCR results , or for contact tracing purposes . Although high 135 technical specificity was demonstrated , clinicians should be aware of limitations of IgG 136 testing in interpreting these results . A positive test is an indication of a previous infection , but 137 the timing of the infection , whether it had occurred recently or in the distant past cannot be 138 determined . Avidity testing is used in other contexts but there is currently no data in the 139 context of SARS - CoV - 2 . As time goes by , the clinical specificity may continue to decline as 140 more patients are infected and develop baseline antibodies against the virus . The utility of 141 IgG testing may thus be further limited . In acute settings , adjudication of potential false 142 results with an alternative molecular test may be a better option than serological testing . 143 144 In our study , sample size comprised of a diverse multi - ethnic population from south - east Asia 145 thus reducing bias . We also included samples reactive to multiple viruses and autoimmune 146 disorder representing negative controls , collected prior to the SARS - CoV - 2 pandemic , which 147 serves to validate potential cross - reactivity . We confirmed that the Abbott SARS - CoV - 2 148 exhibited an excellent specificity , corroborating earlier reports [ 4 ] . A limitation in our 149 sample - set is that sera from patients with known infection with the other commonly 150 circulating human coronaviruses were unavailable . Future evaluations of serological assays 151 should include such samples where available . 152 153 In our study , we have shown that the S / CO of SARS - CoV - 2 IgG increased over time with 154 better clinical sensitivity demonstrated between samples that were taken ≥ 14 days compared 155 to < 14 days after onset of clinical illness . This was statistically significant , but no appreciable 156 differences in S / CO values were otherwise detected between 14 - 20 days and ≥ 21 days . This 157 important finding underscores the important point that for SARS - CoV - 2 IgG , samples taken 158 14 days after days’ illness may thus serve as an adequate threshold for testing to optimize 159 retrospective identification of COVID - 19 patients . Further evaluations should be performed 160 to confirm these findings and to develop a diagnostic algorithm integrating serological testing 161 with other testing modalities . 162 163 A number of cases remained negative even after ≥ 14 days after the onset of illness . In light 164 progressively increasing S / CO and high specificity of the assay , we propose that 165 modifications to the cut - off for determining reactivity may be considered . In Table 2 , 166 lowering the cut - off to 1 . 0 or 0 . 8 resulted in improved clinical sensitivity of the assay without 167 compromising specificity in our dataset . However , lowering cut - offs for specific assays 168 should be carefully considered as they may also lower specificity as has been demonstrated 169 by the analysis of borderline results by Tang et al [ 4 ] . A grey - zone or indeterminate range for 170 the assay may be useful in indicating that previous SARS - CoV - 2 infections cannot be 171 excluded . So far , cross - reactivity to commonly circulating human coronaviruses has not been 172 demonstrated [ 5 ] . Cross - reactivity may occur in SARS and MERS coronavirus patients , but 173 widespread community spread of these strains is uncommon [ 6 ] . 174 175 The correlation between antibody production and outcomes or long - term immunity has not 176 been established . There have also been media reports of possible re - infection with SARS - 177 CoV - 2 after recovery , although there are still questions about the testing used and to date , 178 there are no published data documenting reinfections . Animal studies suggest that reinfection 179 is unlikely [ 7 ] . Further work is required in determining whether the presence of neutralizing 180 antibodies confer long - term immunity in humans . This is vital for several reasons including 181 identifying potential donors of convalescent plasma , measuring immunogenicity in vaccine 182 development , and determining degree of herd immunity in the community [ 8 ] . Additional 183 studies are also required to correlate serological studies against clinical outcomes and long - 184 term immunity . 185 186 One advantage of the Abbott SARS - CoV - 2 IgG assay is that is it performed on the Abbott 187 Architect i4000SR analyzer , which has high throughput and allows for population - based 188 screening of a large number of patients . The fact is that many patients may be asymptomatic 189 throughout the infection period or have such mild symptoms that they do not come forward 190 for medical review and subsequent testing . Epidemiological and seroprevalence studies may 191 be too difficult and impracticable to conduct otherwise with testing platforms that have 192 limited throughput . 193 194 In conclusion , the Abbott SARS - CoV - 2 IgG test has high technical specificity . There is 195 potential room for improving clinical sensitivity of the assay to detect previous infection . 196 Testing of IgG after 14 days from onset of illness may be considered for retrospective 197 identification of patients . It should be noted however , that the interpretation of IgG testing 198 may change as a larger proportion of patients develop baseline antibodies against the virus . 199 SARS - CoV - 2 IgG testing instead could have multiple other potential applications particularly 200 if it can be correlated against immunity to subsequent infections . This would be instrumental 201 in vaccine development , clinical trials , and epidemiological studies . 202 203 Conflicts of Interest : 204 PT has received grants paid to the National University Hospital from Roche , Johnson & 205 Johnson , Sanofi Pasteur , GlaxoSmithKline , and Shionogi .
