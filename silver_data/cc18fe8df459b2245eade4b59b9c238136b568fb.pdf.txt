Given the challenge and uncertainty of gauging the quality of academic research , gatekeepers often possess incentives to prefer the work of established academ - ics . Such preferences breach scientific norms of universalism and can stifle innovation . This article analyzes repeat authors within academic journals as a possible exemplar of the Mat - thew Effect . Using publication data for 347 economics journals from 1980 – 2017 , as well as from three major generalist science journals , we analyze how articles written by repeat authors fare vis - à - vis less - experienced authors . Results show that articles written by repeat authors steadily decline in citation impact with each additional repeat authorship . Despite these declines , repeat authors also tend to garner more citations than debut authors . These contrasting results suggest both benefits and drawbacks associated with repeat author - ships . Journals appear to respond to feedback from previous publications , as more - cited authors in a journal are more likely to be selected for repeat authorships . Institutional char - acteristics of journals also affect the likelihood of repeat authorship , as well as citation out - comes . Repeat authorships – particularly in leading academic journals – reflect innovative incentives and professional reward structures , while also influencing the intellectual content of science . 1 . Introduction Cumulative advantage is a common mechanism underpinning and exacerbating social inequalities . Due to unique institutional , cultural , and personal attributes of academic profes - sions , cumulative advantage is an especially prevalent phenomenon in science . To explain cumulative advantage in science , Merton [ 1 ] famously coined the Matthew Effect , a term denoting processes by which privileged scientists accrue further advantages and rewards solely by virtue of their status . These processes are at odds with Merton’s [ 2 ] norm of universalism – the notion that scientists and their work should be judged and rewarded irrespective of their personal or social characteristics – as well as contemporary social norms regarding meritocracy PLOS ONE PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0265831 April 13 , 2022 1 / 17 a1111111111a1111111111a1111111111a1111111111a1111111111 OPEN ACCESS Citation : Siler K , Vincent - Lamarre P , SugimotoCR , Larivi è reV ( 2022 ) Cumulative advantageand citation performance ofrepeat authors in scholarly journals .

Academic journals are the heart of the scientific reward system , characterized by status hierarchies of publication outlets . In this system , top journals attract and develop what are believed to be the most important articles , which in turn bestow symbolic capital upon authors . Via talent , social status and / or luck , repeat authors occupy disproportionate intellectual space and attention in top journals and academic fields . This article examines repeat author - ships within academic journals – authors who publish repeatedly in the same journal – as an exemplar of the Matthew Effect in science . In particular , we analyze the prevalence of repeat authorships in various academic journals , as well the citation performance of articles written by repeat authors . Citation performance is one indicator – among others – of an article’s success and usefulness in academia . Recent studies have used citation outcomes of published articles to gauge whether gatekeepers were overly permissive or harsh in evaluating certain articles [ 3 , 4 ] . We apply this principle to repeat authors in academic journals . Specifically , we examine whether the citation performance of articles written by repeat authors is better or worse than contributions from debut authors . The citation performance of repeat authors can reveal evi - dence whether journal gatekeepers tend to be relatively harsh , permissive or neutral towards submissions from repeat authors . Using citation datasets of articles published in three leading generalist science journals , as well as 347 economics journals , we examine the citation perfor - mance of repeat authors in a variety of publishing contexts . Numerous status and professional life - course factors influence career and innovation incentives for academics , as well as signal - ing and gatekeeping incentives for journals . These factors will be discussed , focusing on how they might influence the prevalence and innovative impact of repeat authors in varying aca - demic journals . 1 . 1 . Article overview First , we discuss cumulative advantage processes in science , and how they relate to repeat authors in academic journals . Then , we discuss career and life - course factors in academic careers , which exert social and intellectual influences on the work scholars produce . Repeat authors may tend to offer different innovations than debut authors , which influences their prevalence and innovative impact in academic journals . We also discuss the role journals and gatekeepers play in promoting academic ideas and careers , particularly as high - status journals exert substantial intellectual and professional influence over academic reward structures . Given the high rejection rates and competitiveness of many high - status journals , the relative prevalence of repeat authors in such journals is intellectually and professionally significant . Using Web of Science data , we empirically identify the prevalence of repeat authorship in various types of academic journals . In particular , we focus on how journal status is related to the number of repeat authors in a journal . Then , we examine how the citation impact of pub - lished articles varies when written by repeat authors vis - à - vis debut authors . We also analyze how citation impact changes with each additional publication for the few – but significant – authors who have multiple repeat authorships in a given journal . Feedback and learning effects of successful publications are also investigated . Scholars and gatekeepers alike may be influ - enced by highly - cited articles with future submissions to the same journal . Thus , we examine how citation performance of an article increases the likelihood of future authorships in the same journal . We also analyze possible ‘chaperone’ effects [ 5 ] , where previous co - authorship with high - status senior authors can bolster the careers of junior scholars . Specifically , we com - pare the performance of debut authors with and without previous ‘chaperone’ publications . Our research provides new evidence and perspectives on the incentives , hierarchies and reward structures of modern science , as reflected through the publication system .

This raises normative and policy issues regarding systemic costs and benefits of cumulative advantage in professional life . Cumulative advantage affects fairness and innovation in professional and creative contexts , raising normative issues regard - ing whether stakeholders and institutions should take actions to mitigate such processes . 2 . Theoretical background 2 . 1 . Status and cumulative advantage in science Two main mechanisms underpin the Matthew Effect : privileged actors receive 1 ) more favor - able evaluations and 2 ) increased resources [ 6 ] . Causal relationships between quality and status can interact and flow in both directions [ 7 ] . When faced with uncertainty , people often weight the social status and other ascriptive characteristics of others to inform appraisals and deci - sions [ 8 ] . In science , academics are more likely to invoke particularistic characteristics of authors ( e . g . , institutional status , gender ) as decisive information under conditions of uncer - tainty [ 9 – 11 ] , such as at the frontier of new scientific research [ 12 ] . Particularly in evaluative settings , academics are often influenced by the social status of authors . Numerous studies have identified that higher - status academics tend to receive more favorable evaluations [ 13 – 17 ] . Merton [ 1 ] posited that science was prone to generating Matthew Effects ; self - fulfilling prophecies where high - status scholars accrue further rewards and cumulative advantages by virtue of their privileged status . Relatedly , intellectually conservative tendencies and incentives have also been identified in science [ 18 – 21 ] . Successful academics accrue power and influence , enabling leaders in scientific fields to judge academic work according to their preferred princi - ples , in a sort of ‘victor’s history . ’ The phenomenon of preferring intellectually similar work is known as cognitive particularism [ 22 ] . Biases favoring cognitively proximate work or from socially close authors may have benefits . Past studies have found that evaluation quality [ 23 ] and citation impact [ 24 – 26 ] improve with increased social and intellectual closeness of refer - ees . Further , academic journal editors tend to handle submissions from repeat authors more rapidly and favorably [ 27 ] . In turn , Matthew Effects in science can be partly underpinned by benign – if not rational – incentives and may sometimes generate some positive consequences for gatekeepers and broader academic fields . Established authors may have signalling advantages with accruing citations after high - pro - file publications , as they have pre - existing reputations and histories to establish visibility and credibility with other scholars . When academics receive high - profile awards , their previous publications receive a boost in citations [ 7 ] , which also causes intellectually proximate scholars to be crowded out of the research area [ 28 ] . Prestige - garnering publications in high - profile journals may function like similar public adornments of status on scientists . Established schol - ars also tend to possess professional advantages with social and intellectual networks , further helping them develop and disseminate their work . In turn , academia tends to reproduce itself in both ideas and personnel [ 18 ] . Consequently , academia usually updates orthodoxies slowly and tends to protect the status quo [ 29 ] . Paradigmatic and professional advances are often only made possible via the death or retirement of prominent scholars , opening attention and journal space for other academics , as science advances “one funeral at a time” [ 30 ] . Thus , the phenomenon of repeat authorship should be understood in part though social and intellectual advantages established scholars tend to possess . 2 . 2 . Career and aging effects in science Professional age is one factor which influences authorial strategies , goals , and cognitions in sci - ence . Cognitive skills vary – some qualities improving , others attenuating – over both PLOS ONE Cumulativeadvantage and citation performance of repeat authors in academicjournals PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0265831 April 13 , 2022 3 / 17 professional careers and the broader life - course [ 31 ] . In turn , people tend to reach peak career performance at different ages in different professions . Academic professions also present sci - entists with differing resources and incentives in their early , middle , and late careers . Accord - ingly , academics vary in their intellectual preferences and professional choices throughout their careers [ 32 , 33 ] . Creativity and prolificness vary throughout academic careers [ 34 , 35 ] , as the tacit knowledge , social networks , experience , and reputations scholars develop over time all influence their published outputs . Given advantages accrued by established academics , Merton [ 2 ] dubbed science a gerontoc - racy . A review of previous studies on scientific productivity and age found that different case studies yielded advantages for younger scholars [ 34 ] , while others showed advantages for older scholars [ 36 ] . In other cases , the relationship between age and productivity is curvilinear , with advantages [ 37 ] and disadvantages [ 38 ] for mid - career scientists . Over time , academics tend to transition into different authorship roles based on seniority [ 39 ] and previous publishing suc - cess [ 5 ] . In turn , academic careers and innovation involve navigating trade - offs between liabil - ities of newness [ 40 ] vis - à - vis liabilities of senescence [ 41 ] . Exogenous and institutional factors influence the relationship between age and innovation in academic careers . For example , the average age of scientists making major discoveries in science is getting progressively later [ 42 ] . Academic disciplines may be changing professionally and cognitively , but increases in lab size and specialization , as well as hiring bottlenecks and declines in funding are also influencing these delays [ 42 , 43 ] . Such changes in the academic opportunity structure favor older – if not also repeat – authors in academic journals . If older or repeat authors receive more citations with later articles , this could be an indica - tion of skill increasing over the course of the career of a scientist . Professional successes and failures influence future decision - making ; effective learning from outcomes can contribute to skill improvement [ 44 ] . However , success is also conducive to increased specialization in the future , as researchers tend to exploit and expand upon successful established niches in science , as opposed to exploring new terrain [ 45 – 47 ] . The inverse relationship between success and exploration may influence successful scientists to be more conventional and less innovative later in their careers . 2 . 3 . Skill and luck in academic careers Through internal labor markets , as well as tenure and promotion protocol , academia winnows scientists over time . Scholars cannot accrue lengthy publication histories if not given the opportunity . In turn , longevity alone may be associated with skill in science . The infamous “publish or perish” dictum in science may privilege quantity over quality . Numerous observers have expressed concerns that some academics sacrifice quality for quantity of publications in their careers [ 48 – 50 ] . A recent analysis of National Academy of Sciences members found that the positive relationship between productivity and highly - cited articles can be explained solely by the fact that prolific authors produce more opportunities to have a ‘hit’ article [ 51 ] . Simon - ton’s [ 35 ] Equal Odds Ratio posits that “the relationship between the number of hits and the total number of works produced in a given time period is positive , linear , stochastic , and stable . ” High citation counts accrued by authors or articles often involve random , lucky , or extrane - ous influences . However , more productive academics are more likely to have a relatively higher proportion of highly - cited papers , suggesting that cumulative advantages play a role in the attribution of rewards [ 52 ] . Reflective of the influence of luck and serendipity on academic careers and breakthrough innovations , previous studies have found that there are random ele - ments in academic publishing . Scientists can produce high - impact work at any juncture of PLOS ONE Cumulativeadvantage and citation performance of repeat authors in academicjournals PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0265831 April 13 , 2022 4 / 17 their careers [ 53 , 54 ] . Peer review often involves arbitrary or random elements that develop and select published science , particularly as many highly - competitive journals have acceptance rates of less than 10 % [ 55 – 57 ] . Similar analyses building on agent - based models corroborate the importance of luck in success in science [ 58 , 59 ] . 2 . 4 . Case study : Academic publishing and cumulative advantage Academic journals and their gatekeepers can both amplify and mitigate cumulative advantage in science . Our research focuses on repeat authorship within academic journals as a specific mechanism of cumulative advantage . In most social contexts , including academia , status affects evaluation . We use the context of academia to show how institutions affect cumulative advantage processes . Cumulative advantage influences the professional composition , as well as the innovative and intellectual content of science . These cumulative advantage processes underpin professional and innovative incentives for scholars and gatekeepers alike . We use the academic discipline of economics as a case study , due to its particularly strong professional boundaries and steep intra - professional status hierarchies [ 60 – 62 ] . The field of economics is distinctive within the social sciences both for its heightened prestige and visibility as a discipline , as well as low levels of interaction ( i . e . citations , publications , labor markets , training ) with other disciplines [ 63 – 65 ] . These relatively strong intellectual and professional boundaries [ 66 , 67 ] demarcate economics as a distinctive , autonomous academic field . In turn , the discipline and profession of economics offers a unique , competitive , hierarchical context to analyze factors that underpin cumulative advantage and innovative successes . To complement our analysis of the discipline of economics , we also examine three promi - nent generalist multidisciplinary journals – Nature , Science and Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ( PNAS ) . Using these three generalist journals as additional case studies , this enables analysis of repeat authorship in multiple contexts , including numerous different disciplinary and multidisciplinary academic fields . The economics journals provide a disci - plinary context to examine repeat authors , while the three generalist journals provide an inter - disciplinary context . 3 . Methods and data 3 . 1 . Data Published articles from 347 economics journals from 1980 – 2017 period were retrieved from Clarivate Analytics’ Web of Science , hosted at the Leiden University Centre for Science and Technology Studies ( CWTS ) . Our data includes all journals categorized under the discipline ‘Economics’ in the 2017 Clarivate Journal Citation Report . Article authors were disambiguated using the method developed by Caron and van Eck [ 68 ] . The dataset includes 74 , 697 distinct authors based in the United States who had at least one authorship on the 154 , 784 identified papers , leading to a total of 244 , 110 author - paper combinations ( or authorships ) . We also used a second dataset including all publications from Nature , Science , and the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ( NSP dataset ) including 235 , 409 unique authors having contrib - uted 134 , 030 articles , for a total of 549 , 175 authorships . We conservatively limited the analysis to United States authors in order to restrict potential influences caused by international differ - ences . Academic publishing cultures , incentives and dynamics vary by country , so limiting analysis to United States - based authors ensures a relatively homogenous collection of scholars to analyze . Moreover , United States - based authors account for the majority of economics arti - cles , as well as of articles in Nature , PNAS and Science in our dataset .

Dependent variable : Citations received Since we are analyzing factors conducive to article visibility and the diffusion of ideas in sci - ence , we use citations as an indicator of academic influence and attention . While citations are not necessarily a signal of inherent academic quality , they are signaling which articles receive attention , prominence , and usage in academic fields [ 69 ] . Since citations tend to be exponen - tially distributed , with a few articles possessing extremely large values on the right tail of the distribution [ 70 , 71 ] , the logarithm of citations was taken following this equation : c i ¼ log ð a i þ 1 Þ þ 1 : Where a is the number of citations received by each article . Then , we standardized the cita - tions received by journal per year , following : z i ¼ c i (cid:0) m JY s JY if s JY > 0 0 Otherwise : 8 < : Where μ JY and σ JY are the mean and standard deviation log citations c of all articles pub - lished in each year and journal . In turn , the dependent variable in this study is the z - score of the logarithm of citations received per year and journal for each published article . This transformation made it so that publications are compared to others published in the same year and journal . 3 . 3 . Independent variables In order to measure repeat authorship , we compiled for each author on the byline of each arti - cle , whether that article represented the 1 st , 2 nd , 3 rd , . . . N th article published in that journal by that author as the senior contributor . For each article , seniority is attributed to the author who published the most papers in the same journal prior to the publication of the manuscript . Many articles in our dataset have multiple authors . Authors with numerous different social and demographic characteristics can co - exist on the byline of the same article . For the pur - poses of our research , we assume that credit and attention will tend to focus on the most ‘dis - tinguished’ author on each co - authored paper . Like in most academic disciplines , there is a hierarchy of journals in economics . In in eco - nomics , this hierarchy is especially pronounced . Publishing in “Top Five” journals ( American Economic Review , Econometrica , Journal of Political Economy , Quarterly Journal of Economics , Review of Economic Studies ) carries enormous intellectual and professional influence in eco - nomics [ 72 ] . We use percentile ranks ( 0 – 50 , 50 – 75 , 75 – 90 , 90 – 99 ) by Journal Impact Factors ( JIFs ) and elite status ( “Top 5” journals ) as empirical measures of journal prestige . Notably , due to their special status in the economics profession , “Top 5” journals were analyzed sepa - rately from the top JIF decile . The rank of journals was obtained by ranking all journals for each year where they were each active between 1980 and 2017 . We then computed an average rank for each journal , and the distribution of average ranks was split into percentile rank cate - gories and “Top 5” journals . It is expected that journals with higher impact factors will inher - ently generate more citations for published articles . In turn , it is necessary to include JIFs as a control variable while using total citations as a measure of scientific influence . 3 . 4 . Mixed - effect models Linear mixed - effect models were used to account for repeated measures between journals and authors . We do not report p - values focusing instead on the coefficients of the models . We used PLOS ONE Cumulativeadvantage and citation performance of repeat authors in academicjournals PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0265831 April 13 , 2022 6 / 17 the lme4 package [ 73 ] in R to fit the mixed - effect models , and the arm package [ 74 ] to extract the standard error of the model coefficients . 3 . 5 . Author - level repeat authorship We modelled the citation score ( the natural logarithm of citations received , normalized by year and journal ) as the dependent variable . For the economics dataset , we modelled both the author and the journals as random effects and obtained random coefficients for the JIF ranks . The publication order was considered as a nominal variable because of the non - linear nature of the relationship . In other words , a separate coefficient is estimated for each JIF rank / order level . We did not include an intercept in the model in order for the polarity of the coefficients to be interpretable ( with an average citation score of 0 ) . In contrast to the economics dataset , for the NSP data the journals were not included as random effects , but as random coefficients instead of the JIF rank . 3 . 6 . Probability of repeat authorship We used a logistic mixed - effect model with a binary dependent variable indicating if an author published in the senior position again in the same journal in the future . Like the previous model , the economics dataset had the journal as a random effect and the NSP dataset had the journals as random coefficient instead of the JIF percentiles . This model included the authors as a random effect . However , this model predicted the future publication based on the citation score of the previous publication of the author as a senior author . We discretized the citation score in four quartiles , which were used as random coefficients with the JIF rank ( economics ) or journal ( NSP ) . 3 . 7 . Influence of chaperones Sekara et al . [ 5 ] identified the “chaperone effect” in academic publishing , where co - authoring with prominent senior authors is conducive to transitioning to senior authorship positions in the future . In order to establish the impact of publishing with a more senior author prior to publishing their first senior author publication , we used a mixed - effect model with the citation score of the first senior author publication as a dependent variable . The model uses the journal and authors as random factors for the economics dataset , and the authors for the NSP dataset . It then used the JIF rank ( or journal for NSP ) and whether or not the author has published with a more senior author before ( i . e . previous co - authorship with a chaperone in a focal jour - nal ) as random coefficients . 4 . Results Fig 1 shows the cumulative distribution functions of repeat authorships by JIF percentage and journal ( S1 and S2 Tables ) . Institutional characteristics appear to influence the prevalence of repeat authors in journals . Higher - status journals in economics tend to have more repeat authors . This is a notable finding given the intense competitiveness and selectivity of elite eco - nomics journals ( see [ 3 , 72 ] ) . PNAS has more repeat authors than Nature or Science , perhaps reflecting the influence of institutional membership with the National Academy of Sciences and concomitant publishing opportunities , especially with articles contributed to the journal by members of the National Academy of Sciences ( see [ 75 ] ) . Fig 2 presents the crossed linear mixed effect model without an intercept , showing expected citation differences depending on the repeat author status of senior authors of published arti - cles . Author - level analysis suggests diminishing returns to repeat authorships . Put differently , PLOS ONE Cumulativeadvantage and citation performance of repeat authors in academicjournals PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0265831 April 13 , 2022 7 / 17 senior repeat authors tend to produce their most highly - cited work with their debut contribu - tion , then citations gradually decline with each subsequent publication in the same journal . There were no major appreciable differences in tendencies between the three generalist jour - nals in the NSP dataset . However , the impact decline of repeat authors with each subsequent publication is much stronger in elite economics journals vis - à - vis all other economics journals . Fig 3 illustrates results from the article - level of analysis ( S3 and S4 Tables ) , which contrasts with the author - level analyses illustrated in Fig 2 . Each data point refers to the average citation and standard error for the JIF ( economics ) or journal ( NSP ) . On the whole , articles receive more citations with increases in repeat authorship . This supports the hypothesis that journals tend to benefit from publishing repeat authors , conditional on previous citation performance . Even if there are declines in citations within the careers of publishing authors , repeat authors can still be advantageous for journals because there is a positive correlation between consecu - tive publications ( S1 Fig ) , assuming that journals select repeat authors are influenced by previ - ous performance . In economics , there do not appear to be major status or institutional differences between journals with this general trend . PNAS exhibits a relatively weaker citation advantage for repeat authors than Nature and Science . This could be related to the finding that repeat authorships are less common in Nature and Science than in PNAS . Fig 4 illustrates a possible mechanism underpinning differential citation performance of repeat authors in different journals ( S7 and S8 Tables ) . Journals vary in the degree to which the previous citations accrued by an author affects the likelihood of future ( repeat ) authorship . The model in Fig 4 uses the citation score of the previous publication of an author as a predic - tor of whether or not they would publish a subsequent article in the same journal . Once again , we used a crossed logistic mixed - effect model where authors and journals have random inter - cepts . We binned the citation score in quartiles , with the lowest quartile ( 4 th ) as a reference cat - egory . The positive slope observed in the log - odds of repeat publication shows that the higher Fig 1 . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0265831 . g001 Fig 2 . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0265831 . g002 PLOS ONE Cumulativeadvantage and citation performance of repeat authors in academicjournals PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0265831 April 13 , 2022 8 / 17 quantile of the citation score of the previous publication , the higher the odds than an author will publish in the same journal again . The slopes are similar for journals of varying status lev - els , with the exception of lower - status ( bottom 50 % ) economics journals , which are slightly less sensitive to the previous citation score overall . Analogously , PNAS appears less sensitive to the previous citation scores of repeat authors than Nature or Science . Fig 5 illustrates effects of ‘chaperones’ on citation performance as another facet of repeat authorship . We took the first publication of every author in a given journal as a senior author . In co - authorship cases of authors with identical past experience , we attributed the senior posi - tion randomly . We then assigned the authors in two groups depending on whether they pub - lished with a more senior author in the journal . Across all of the journals in our dataset , authors without chaperones tended to receive fewer citations overall . In economics , the cita - tion penalty of lacking a chaperone was strongest in higher - status journals . Analogously , PNAS exhibited slightly greater citation underperformance for articles without chaperones than Nature and Science . 5 . Discussion Our findings suggest mixed incentives associated with repeat authors . Although the citation impact of articles from repeat authors steadily declined with each additional published article in the same journal , there are still incentives for journals to publish repeat authors . Even if individual repeat authors experience citation declines with each additional publication , they still tend to garner above - average citation counts within that particular journal . Thus , there appear to be incentives for journals and gatekeepers to publish repeat authors , especially when Fig 3 . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0265831 . g003 Fig 4 . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0265831 . g004 PLOS ONE Cumulativeadvantage and citation performance of repeat authors in academicjournals PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0265831 April 13 , 2022 9 / 17 those authors garnered high citation counts with previous articles . These creative incentives exist in contexts beyond academia . Analogously , the film industry is prone to preferring sequels over new franchises . Risk - averse studios prefer the security of leveraging the success of a proven ‘parent’ brand over trying new innovations . Much like the repeat academic authors in our research , although movie sequels are usually less profitable than predecessor films , they still tend to financially outperform most new contributions [ 76 ] . Institutional characteristics of journals influence the prevalence of repeat authors , as well as the citation outcomes of those repeat authors . The hierarchical academic field of economics exhibited varying trends and outcomes regarding repeat authorship , depending on the status of the journal . In particular , the elite “Top Five” economics journals – which hold substantial professional and intellectual influence – exhibited contrasting results with other economics journals . Even though publishing in those five economics journals is extremely competitive , they published more repeat authors relative to lower - status journals . Whether this is due to skill , luck and / or social connections of those repeat authors is an open question . Repeat authors in elite economics journals exhibited larger citation declines with repeat authorships than in other journals . This suggests that in elite economics journals , repeat authors make their largest impacts with their debut article . However , despite this apparent benefit of new contributors , debut authors without co - authoring ‘chaperones’ who have previously published in the journal were relatively less - cited in higher - status economics journals . With the general - ist journals in our study , PNAS exhibited some different trends vis - à - vis Nature and Science . PNAS had relatively more repeat authors than Nature and Science , repeat authors had a smaller citation advantage , and appeared to be less - sensitive to the previous performance of repeat authors in the journal . These differences are likely at least in part due to PNAS ’s institutional links to the National Academy of Sciences and unique peer review structure ( see [ 75 ] ) . In sum , strategic and cultural characteristics of academic publishing institutions affect representation and innovation . 5 . 1 . Risk , reward and editorial decision - making Editors and journals may rationally prefer articles written by repeat authors out of risk - aver - sion and / or a reasonable belief that repeat authors tend to achieve relatively better innovation and citation outcomes . Given our results – which showed that repeat authors generally receive more citations than debut authors – this is likely an additional incentive compelling editors and gatekeepers to harbor preferences for publishing repeat authors . Leaders tend to be more cog - nizant of downside risk than upside risk [ 77 ] . The uncertainty of the scientific research frontier [ 12 ] is also conducive to decision - making challenges . People tend to rely on heuristics – simple Fig 5 . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0265831 . g005 PLOS ONE Cumulativeadvantage and citation performance of repeat authors in academicjournals PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0265831 April 13 , 2022 10 / 17 rules and schemas – to inform decisions when faced with uncertainty [ 78 ] . These decisions and heuristics can be informed by otherwise irrelevant or arbitrary social and personal characteris - tics [ 8 ] . In turn , uncertainty can breed risk - aversion and preferences for the intellectual and professional status quo , particularly when more certain options are present [ 79 ] . Confirmation bias has been documented in science , where evaluators prefer work that reflects the status quo [ 80 ] . In short , there are numerous social - psychological reasons why editors and journals may prefer repeat authors . Our results also raise normative and empirical issues regarding whether academic journals should prefer repeat authors , from both fairness and innovation perspectives . Alternatively , should journal gatekeepers take action to include more debut and less - experienced authors ? Since academics tend to prefer to cite high - status authors and studies [ 7 , 11 ] , are redistributive policies and actions warranted to counteract such biases ? In some organizational contexts , rewards are redistributed to less - privileged actors in efforts to offset cumulative advantage pro - cesses [ 81 ] . For example , in a study of four high - status economics journals , Card and Della - Vigna [ 3 ] found that more prolific authors tended to be more highly - cited , leading them to conclude that editors at such journals judge submissions from high - status authors relatively stringently . Journal peer review can potentially amplify or mitigate cumulative advantage pro - cesses and hierarchies in science . 5 . 2 . Learning , feedback and editorial preferences Learning is another factor that influences the success of repeat authors in peer review , as well as the scientific output of those authors . The impact of citation feedback on institutional learn - ing is especially important given our findings that journals appear to select repeat authors in part on previous citation performance . Journal editors learn from their experiences interacting with authors in the peer review system [ 57 ] . For authors , experience with the peer review sys - tem in a given journal – whether as an author or peer reviewer – helps develop tacit knowledge to successfully navigate that system in the future . Since innovators tend to repeat or emulate successful outcomes , this underpins incentives to focus on exploiting successful niches , instead of exploring new terrain [ 45 , 47 ] . Exploitation of normal science might be a safer choice for authors and gatekeepers alike but tends not to generate breakthrough innovations and para - digm shifts [ 29 , 82 ] . Experience and positive feedback might be valuable for academics , by improving their propensity to successfully navigate peer review and publish their work in pre - ferred outlets . Paradoxically , these learning processes and incentives might also undermine strategies and preferences for generating high - impact work . Repeat authorship increases the likelihood of redundancy in both authors and academic output . If scientific innovation is a matter of randomness or volume of ideas produced [ 35 , 51 , 54 ] , then producing similar ideas will reduce the odds of a breakthrough innovation . 5 . 3 . Status and incentives in academic publishing Repeat authorship reflects innovative incentives within scientific careers , which has broader consequences for field - level innovation . While learning theory posits that success results in a narrowing of subsequent work [ 45 , 47 ] , accrued academic capital may be mutable and deployed in numerous ways . For example , after receiving the Fields Medal – the most presti - gious prize in the field of mathematics – many mathematicians began to “play the field” and engage with numerous new research areas , at the expense of short - term productivity [ 83 ] . Legitimacy and scientific status can be transferable within and between subfields . Depending on the context , processes of cumulative advantage – or Matthew Effects – can give repeat authors PLOS ONE Cumulativeadvantage and citation performance of repeat authors in academicjournals PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0265831 April 13 , 2022 11 / 17 latitude to publish similar work . On the other hand , Matthew Effects can also grant high - status academics latitude to publish work on new topics with a modicum of legitimacy . In recent years , high - status journals in economics have consolidated increasing influence over article citation outcomes . Regardless of whether article quality and / or journal status are influencing these changes , this further underpins competitive incentives to publish in high - JIF journals . Publishing in “Top Five” economics journals is extremely competitive . As of 2017 , acceptance rates in elite economics journals had declined to between 2 . 5 % ( Quarterly Journal of Economics ) and 5 % ( American Economic Review ) [ 3 ] . Whether it can be explained by skill , luck and / or social connections , the persistence of the phenomenon of repeat authorship in these intensely competitive journals is notable . More broadly , scientific incentives for scholars and innovation trajectories – particularly in regards to where to attempt to publish research – are influenced by disciplinary trends and cultures . This trend of increasing concentration of influence in leading journals runs counter to most other fields in contemporary science , which are instead exhibiting trends of decreased concentration of citations in top journals [ 84 ] . 6 . Conclusion Repeat authors are especially influential and important in science . Particularly in high - status journals , repeat authors exert disproportionate influences on disciplinary agendas . Despite the crowding and competitiveness associated with publishing in high - status journals , such jour - nals were relatively more prone to publishing repeat authors . In our case study of economics , higher - status journals were relatively more conducive to repeat authorship . Further investigat - ing the relationship between institutional status and cumulative advantage is a matter for future research , both inside and outside of academic contexts . Our research also suggests that repeat authorship offers different incentives to journal gate - keepers and academics . In terms of citation impact , journal gatekeepers benefit from publish - ing repeat authors , especially when gatekeepers select repeat authors based on previous citation performance . In contrast to the apparent benefits of publishing repeat authors in gen - eral , within the individual careers of scientists , citation impact steadily declines with each repeat authorship . Declining citation impact with repeat authorships also suggests costs of trading exploratory for exploitative innovation strategies . Our results also suggest a potential downside of the Matthew Effect in academic publishing . Preferring repeat authors may be a risk - averse decision - making strategy for journal gatekeepers dealing with the uncertainty of appraising and choosing the most meritorious science to publish . However , these cumulative advantage incentives and processes may also present risks of undermining innovation and diversity in science , if not also professional norms of meritocracy .
