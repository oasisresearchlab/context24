Through refexive ethnographic work with the Anti - Eviction Mapping Project , we trace three intertwined genres of temporality in our community - based design process : slow design with care ; rapid design in response to the urgency of crises ; and disruptive design that seeps in from Silicon Valley , proving to “move fast and break things . ” We assess temporal tensions and contradictions in an evolving data landscape by examining struggles over our pace of practice , time - based media lifecycles , and tooling trade - ofs . Theo - rizing community - based design dilemmas , we contemplate ways of mindfully designing with time , making the past present via digital storytelling , and reimagining technological relations over time .

Yet , the recklessness that this motto implies is largely incompatible with community con - texts of technological design—or at least in part .

On the other hand , breaking “things” wreaks harm and havoc , reproducing racial capitalist contexts of housing precarity , gentrif - cation , and dispossession . As Ruha Benjamin saliently questions , “What about the people and places broken in the process ? ” [ 13 ] . Community - building in contrast to breaking , at its core , hinges upon relational care , thoughtfulness , and trust . In such contexts , time is no less of the essence , but all the more fragile indeed . With this in mind , here we ponder how community - based design might move quickly enough to meet the urgency of particular crises , yet slowly enough to build rather than break community over time . In this paper , we conceptualize time as the fow and sequence of moments , and temporality as having to do with interpretations and experiences of the past , present , and future ( and all of their recursive in - betweens ) . Expanding upon literatures that examine temporal techniques in design research [ 63 , 64 , 100 , 125 – 127 , 132 , 140 ] and felds such as feminist technology studies [ 9 , 45 , 71 , 107 , 110 , 174 ] , we explore this conjuncture by examining oscillation between fast and slow community - based design techniques [ 10 , 44 , 72 , 73 , 94 ] . We also refect upon temporal trajectories and tensions through our engagement with a sub - project of the Anti - Eviction Mapping Project ( AEMP ) entitled the Covid - 19 Housing Story Map . The AEMP is a grassroots digital cartography , data visualiza - tion , and multimedia storytelling collective with chapters primarily in the San Francisco Bay Area , Los Angeles , and New York City . The collective works with an array of community partners toward housing justice futures , despite contexts of eviction , dispossession , displacement , and houselessness [ 111 , 137 ] . Throughout this paper , we rethink time and technology in community - based design by refecting upon our three - year long AEMP engagement to digitally map Covid - 19 pandemic evictions , tenant stories , and related hous - ing data in the US and globally [ 138 , 139 ] . Born digitally at the onset of the pandemic - exacerbated eviction crisis in March 2020 , our Covid - 19 Housing Story Map presents tenant stories of resis - tance amid a sea change of housing protection legislation , eviction data , and policy failures . As a technologically - complex endeavor , the project challenged the AEMP community - based design practices in new ways regarding divergent temporalities and technocultures . We focus on these challenges here , looking at instances of time tied up with technoculture , or the cultures of technology imbri - cated in modes of being in and thinking through , with , and against time . Indebted to vast bodies of scholarship on entanglements of temporality and technocultures [ 8 , 9 , 18 , 71 , 179 ] , we think through the spatio - technocultural dimensions , contradictions , and struggles of producing our Covid - 19 Housing Story Map in contexts of crisis 2469 DIS ’23 , July 10 – 14 , 2023 , Pitsburgh , PA , USA Halperin & McElroy Figure 1 : Covid - 19 Housing Story Map : Oral Hxstories of Tenant Resistance & Eviction Information tab [ 139 ] both new and not new . We theorize our encounters with what Eliza - beth Freeman describes as “chrononormative” relationships to time [ 45 ] —or time that socially reproduces capitalist materialities , heter - normative desires , and productive imaginaries . In our examination of Silicon Valley chrononormativity , we trace our encounters with the temporal impulses of technological practices such as “scrum master” protocols in software development and “design thinking” [ 83 , 84 ] , as they work to optimize and linearize time toward a “Silicon Valley - centric future” [ 38 ] . Further , we consider Judy Wajc - man’s analyses of how Silicon Valley technologists conceptualize time as a “quantitative , individualistic resource” that obscures its politics in the abstraction and digitization of calendars to optimize for productivity . She also observes the misconception that automa - tion will propagate more time : “digitalization has wrought a new temporality of acceleration , immediacy and instantaneity” [ 174 ] . In many ways , Wajcman’s intervention updates Marxist cri - tiques of how technological development produces capitalist tech - nocultures , relations , and alienation with promises of innovation [ 105 , 120 ] . We recognize these historical contexts as they inform the present . We thus refuse presentist framings [ 159 , 160 ] of techno - logical induced racial dispossession as new or novel , despite Silicon Valley hegemonic frameworks of analysis and historiography . Since Silicon Valley growth is entangled in processes of displace - ment [ 112 , 113 , 137 , 176 ] —and because the AEMP organizes against gentrifcation in Silicon Valley’s urban backyard , we fnd it impor - tant to interrogate the region’s technocultural temporalities that infltrated our project . With a critical lens , we explore ways that Silicon temporal logics subsumed and destabilized our grassroots organizing in pandemic times . We analyze three intertwined tem - poralities of care , crisis , and culture as “move fast and break things” practices harmed our urgent but delicate work involving technol - ogy . We focus upon this incursion as it impacted the creation of our Covid - 19 interactive digital story map , conversing with ongoing ex - plorations regarding temporality of design [ 100 , 125 , 126 , 132 , 142 ] and digital narrative - making [ 12 , 16 ] . Through refexive ethno - graphic work , we address the temporal technocultural tensions that impeded our community - based design process . We also articulate collective eforts made on behalf of the AEMP to , as adrienne maree brown has well articulated , “move at the speed of trust” [ 104 ] . By homing in on the design of our Covid - 19 Housing Story Map throughout this paper , we examine the temporal conjunctures of this Silicon dialectic , employing what Stuart Hall , inspired by An - tonio Gramsci , has described as conjunctural analysis . By this , he conceptualizes an analysis based upon the coalescing and opposing facets entangled within the power dynamics of a particular period of time [ 61 ] . For Hall , conjunctural analysis allows for mapping social and cultural spaces during a specifc moment in time to iden - tify sites of potential political intervention . Hall employed such 2470 Temporal Tensions in Digital Story Mapping for Housing Justice DIS ’23 , July 10 – 14 , 2023 , Pitsburgh , PA , USA analysis in his Policing the Crisis , describing the fault - lines of neolib - eralism not to ofer a clear path beyond it , but to diagnose stakes and trajectories [ 62 ] . Similarly , we experiment with conjunctural analysis here to , as Donna Haraway puts it , “stay with the trouble” [ 70 ] , regarding Silicon Valley spatiotemporal design struggles amid the pandemic - augmented housing crisis . In other words , we focus upon the contradictions and struggles that we encountered not to prescribe a way out , but rather to unveil and assess the temporal challenges and stakes of community - based design during fragile moments of crisis ( which are pervasive given that capitalism is al - ways in crisis ) . We thus explore the central question : what temporal tensions were entangled in our community - based design process ? In exploring temporal conjunctures and contradictions in our design process , we contribute nuanced understanding to literatures on community - based engagements and criticisms of technocultural temporalities . Building upon traditions of refection on design pro - cesses , we turn inward through ethnographic analysis that invokes critical introspection for understanding the time and technology relations that we encountered over three years . We engage in this self - refexive critique to theorize the oppressive and opportune tem - poralities that arise in community sites of design and technology . We also contribute sociotechnical insights in the context of housing justice work . Furthermore , our examination of normative time and temporality expands design repertoires for navigating temporal tensions at complex sites of engagement . In synthesis , we ofer community - based design implications : how designers might mind - fully design with time , make the past present by digitally rendering displaced histories visible , and reimagine technological relations over time , despite diferential pressures of crisis response and dis - ruptive practices . Our inquiry is shaped not only by the landscape of our situatedness in the AEMP as two of many members who contributed to the Covid - 19 Housing Story Map [ 138 , 139 ] , but also in the world writ large as tenants were faced with impending evictions and subpar housing protections unevenly but globally . 2 BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK Here , we provide background on the AEMP as a community - led col - lective united toward housing justice futures and review literatures on community - based design , as well as on time and temporality . 2 . 1 The Anti - Eviction Mapping Project ( AEMP ) and Brief Historical Context Co - founded in 2013 , the Anti - Eviction Mapping Project ( AEMP ) is a data visualization , digital cartography , and multimedia storytelling collective of volunteer artists , technologists , tenants , evictees , orga - nizers , geographers , data analysts , digital humanists , oral historians , housing researchers , urban planners , and more . Although we bring diferent lived experiences and knowledges to the project , we are grounded in a shared commitment to housing justice and to working in collaborative activist - based structures . From counter - mapping narratives of displacement and resistance [ 134 ] to co - creating a Counterpoints atlas [ 137 ] , the collective documents dispossession and resistance upon gentrifed landscapes with chapters primarily in the San Francisco Bay Area , Los Angeles , and New York City , and with community partners in countries such as Romania and Italy . The AEMP builds upon the rich history and tradition of coun - termapping , which recognizes the imperial and capitalist violence that cartography wields , while experimenting with cartographic practices of the otherwise [ 82 , 89 , 116 ] . The collective also designs software and tools to empower direct action organizing with data to embolden campaigns and identify serial evictors [ 109 , 112 ] . As means of accumulating capital and power , housing privati - zation and accumulation has long destabilized and displaced low - income tenants , neighborhoods of color , and those unable or unwill - ing to own land across the imperial space of US and beyond . This has in turn incentivized diverse forms of resistance , tool - making , and documentation . For instance , in response to Western imperial knowledge production and land theft , Indigenous oral history and countermapping has long functioned to document violence , while also producing other spatiotemporal understandings [ 58 , 103 ] . As Michael Frisch has articulated , oral histories enable spaces of shared authority , which helps destabilize the authoritative space of the “objective” historian [ 48 ] . Meanwhile , important archival , narrative , and oral history projects have archived rent strikes and practices of squatting , commoning , and more [ 56 , 81 , 150 , 162 ] . During the San Francisco Bay Area’s Dot Com Boom and racialized dispossession that it materialized , oral historians such as Nancy Mirabal led stu - dents and community members in recording oral histories of Latinx housing struggles and solidarities in the Mission District [ 118 ] . Prior to the Covid - 19 - exacerbated eviction crisis that began in 2020 , the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis expedited Bay Area racial - ized housing struggles and fnancial turmoil . The “Tech Boom 2 . 0” then unevenly exacerbated housing inequities , particularly in ar - eas proximate to big tech infrastructure such as “Google buses” [ 101 , 107 ] . This , along with ongoing forms of resistance and re - bellion , inspired the AEMP collective’s frst oral history project , Narratives of Displacement and Resistance [ 134 ] , which records and geocodes narratives across San Francisco and Alameda Counties [ 102 ] . However , given that other neighborhoods in the region have been struggling with anti - Black and colonial urban policies long before either technology boom transpired , the AEMP has since engaged in other narrative - based work such as the making of our ( Dis ) location Black Exodus zine and Counterpoints atlas to better chronicle long histories of racial expulsion , exclusion , infrastruc - tural and health inequities , and incarceration , as well as abolitionist and decolonial organizing [ 136 , 137 ] . Although much of the AEMP’s work has fused the digital with the analog—from crafting zines in multimedia formats to painting murals of digital oral stories— Covid - 19 social distancing challenged the viability of in - person co - creation of print materials , as well as on - the - ground physical meeting and organizing . Thus , the Covid - 19 - era foregrounded new reliance upon digitality , introducing a temporal and technocultural shift that reshaped the fabric of the project with consequences . 2 . 2 Community - Based Design Approaches Many scholars have approached community - based design [ 10 , 22 , 44 , 72 , 73 , 94 ] as a planned method of social change [ 74 ] rooted in the social science tradition of community - based participatory research [ 97 ] : social action programs to address social problems 2471 DIS ’23 , July 10 – 14 , 2023 , Pitsburgh , PA , USA Halperin & McElroy [ 153 ] like housing insecurity [ 35 , 66 , 72 , 91 , 181 ] . In working to - ward urban justice , researchers have developed promising geo - graphic information systems ( GIS ) [ 33 , 34 , 75 , 124 , 156 ] and nar - rative systems [ 37 , 65 , 115 , 155 , 161 ] —sometimes combining the two [ 30 , 102 , 151 , 181 ] . However , as many scholars have cautioned , without careful practices , such systems can propagate harms that include manifesting carceral and imperial geographies [ 82 , 85 ] , ad - vancing extractive agendas [ 106 , 111 ] , erasing community knowl - edge [ 1 ] , and motivating the criminalization of poverty ( e . g . , gen - erating narratives that cast squatters and renters as antagonistic threats to evict [ 67 ] ) . In community contexts , designing technology raises many techno - political [ 13 , 53 , 92 , 129 , 180 ] and value tensions [ 95 , 98 , 167 , 171 ] . Often enough , communities experience scholars parachuting in to collect data and design “solutions” in extractive and ungrounded ways that most beneft the researchers—even when conducted as “participatory action research” [ 99 ] . Even research conducted with good intentions can cause harm , leading to Eve Tuck’s request for researchers to “suspend damage” by rethinking analytical categories that many scholars impose upon “marginalized people” who they describe as one - dimensionally de - pleted , ruined , and without agency [ 170 ] . Epistemic violence be - comes re - inscribed through such framing and parachuting . It takes situated and feminist commitments , as Haraway describes [ 69 ] , to understand that across sites of inquiry , community , home , gentrif - cation , and dispossession may mean diferent things and appear in diferent ways [ 39 , 40 , 149 , 158 ] . As Robin D . G . Kelley , AbdouMaliq Simone , and others have shown , resistance does not have to appear revolutionary or be overt [ 86 , 157 ] . At the same time , gentrifca - tion , as Asher Ghertner argues , analytically may not apply to much of the world [ 6 ] . This makes designing a universalist map of gen - trifcation , resistance , evictions , and land tenure impossible and epistemologically violent—a project at odds with Silicon Valley romances with scaling . Given all the variation across places and spaces , a framework that imposes a singular notion of community inevitably inficts epistemic violence [ 111 , 114 ] . Thus , community - based design conceptions , contexts , and approaches must vary . Some approaches to community - based design are more efec - tive than others at encouraging substantive change over time . As Vera Khovanskaya and colleagues have argued , user - centered de - sign methods , for instance , work to maintain the status quo with technologies that ft into the existing world , rather than rework or challenge the inequities that communities face [ 87 ] . In looking to make community - based design engagements more equitable , Christina Harrington and colleagues found that some members of Latine and Black communities in a midwest US city viewed certain activities and materials often used in user - centered design ( e . g . , colored pencils and markers ) as “infantilizing and belittling ; ” this seemed to exacerbate the already - existing “barriers to obtaining nar - ratives” regarding their concerns about housing , which they were already hesitant to disclose out of fear of judgment and landlord retaliation [ 72 ] . To address these barriers , Halperin and colleagues probed a community - based conversational storytelling agent that they found to make some residents feel more comfortable and able to disclose their stories of housing insecurity , but also with the potential for it to advance harms in its algorithmic material and scalability—attributes often lauded at sites of design and technology [ 66 ] . What we see across these studies is the complexity of design in communities facing housing precarity . Conventional user - centered techniques and optimisms do not squarely ft . Community - based design requires an alternate orientation to ascertain the kind of meaningful change that works toward reorienting power structures . Looking beyond the dominant paradigms , numerous scholars have developed approaches to community - based design that can support thinking about and enacting change over time . While far from exhaustive , many researchers ofer methods and frameworks of particular relevance to our inquiry . For instance , Carl DiSalvo’s adversarial design considers the political expression of computation to challenge power structures over time [ 31 ] . Additionally , Daniela Rosner presents a generative framework with the concept of critical fabulations as narrative tactics that can abet design activism by fore - grounding marginalized histories [ 148 ] . Meanwhile , other works demonstrate how telling digital stories of past unjust events in the present can work toward more just futures [ 30 , 66 , 115 ] . In such eforts , Mariam Asad and Chris Le Dantec call for design to support existing activist practices , particularly in contexts of housing justice [ 4 , 5 ] . Similarly , Sasha Costanza - Chock posits design justice meth - ods to “amplify , support , and extend existing community - based processes” [ 24 ] —in efect , this positions design futuring in rela - tion to past and present processes . Such approaches align with social justice - oriented interaction design commitments to conficts , politics , and acts of resistance that may slow the progression of op - pressive systems [ 32 , 42 , 43 ] . These interventions dovetail with the grassroots culture of technology practice that Sucheta Ghoshal and colleagues scafold for designers to redress technocultural value ten - sions as social movements build over time [ 51 – 53 ] . With a similar outlook , Catherine D’Ignazio and Lauren Klein ofer feminist tech - niques for community data and design work to counter historically dominant practices [ 29 ] , while an anti - colonial and pluralistic lens can reorient the extractive colonial nature of design [ 36 ] . As these orientations provide fruitful basis for community - based design , they only scratch the surface of temporal relations and complications . 2 . 3 Time and Temporality Within design research and adjacent felds , there is a wealth of work ( far more than we are able to fully account for throughout this pa - per ) that is not dedicated to community - based design perse , but is to theories of time and temporality . Of particular relevance to the AEMP given its chapter in the San Francisco Bay Area , is Judy Wa - jcman’s analysis of how Silicon Valley conceives of a “temporality of acceleration , immediacy and instantaneity” for maximizing pro - ductivity [ 174 ] . Of additional relevance is how Elizabeth Freeman theorizes and defnes “chrononormative” time as “the use of time to organize human bodies toward maximum productivity” [ 45 ] . These critical perspectives , along with those of adrienne marie brown’s analysis of moving at the speed of trust [ 104 ] and Stuart Hall’s examination of how political crises form particular temporal re - lationships [ 61 ] , consider the underlying social practices of time . With respect to temporal design , Larissa Pschetz examines time as social coordination [ 144 ] , as well as how it emerges from cultural , social , economic and political relations that complicate normative focuses on duration , pace , direction , and productive activities [ 143 ] . By and large , design scholars have examined time and tempo - rality in interactions , interfaces , experiences , artifacts , materials , 2472 Temporal Tensions in Digital Story Mapping for Housing Justice DIS ’23 , July 10 – 14 , 2023 , Pitsburgh , PA , USA frames , and processes . Technology design inevitably moves at some pace over time - frames ; artifacts and materials exist with time ; inter - faces can represent time ; and user experiences are inherently tem - poral in terms of how long interactions last . Even media technology can be time - based as exemplifed by audio and video recordings in digital formats that involve direct manipulation of time with playback controls ( e . g . , fast - forward and rewind ) [ 122 ] . To con - sider and reconsider this range of concepts , several design research workshops have convened with a focus on time and temporality [ 100 , 125 , 126 ] . William Odom and colleagues have challenged the design research community to deviate from normative conceptions of time , compartmentalizing temporality concerns as follows : ( 1 ) social and cultural constructions of time ; ( 2 ) expressions , representa - tions , and materiality of time ; and ( 3 ) methodological matters [ 126 ] . Across these dimensions , we fnd varying perspectives around how the nature and value of time is conceived in design research [ 143 ] . Design scholars have argued both in favor of and against vari - ous demonstrations of time and temporality . Investigations have included temporal norms that technology creates in coordinated activities [ 17 ] ; temporal trajectories for shared interactive narra - tives [ 12 ] ; temporal modalities for refecting on data [ 128 ] ; temporal labor and technocultural politics of Silicon Valley services [ 147 ] ; and time - scale techno - politics [ 152 ] . In their seminal work , Lars Hallnäs and Johan Redström present a design philosophy for slow technology to support time for refecting and mentally recharging rather than turbocharging efciency [ 63 , 64 ] . Other researchers have similarly explored how technology can mediate experiences of time like moments for rest [ 20 ] and slowed productivity [ 96 ] . Along with technology - mediated experiences of time , design pro - cesses move at varying paces , ranging from slow design [ 49 , 163 ] for meaningful interactions [ 60 ] to rapid research and prototyping for accelerated software development [ 117 , 166 ] . The duration of design processes thus varies in tandem with time - frames of engage - ment and timelines of use , which can be particularly ephemeral [ 168 ] or expansive [ 68 ] . For instance , with multi - lifespan design , Batya Friedman , Daisy Yoo , and colleagues consider longevity , or how artifacts evolve and change across generations [ 46 , 47 , 182 ] . Ar - tifacts themselves can embody time [ 127 , 140 , 142 ] . These inquiries foreground time as socially entangled and relational [ 140 ] , as well as culturally - situated [ 90 ] . While this rich body of work has yet to examine community - based design temporalities , it reveals how time is conceived and calibrated to varying degrees technologically . Such temporal variation exists in part because of what James Pierce theorizes as a broader tension between progressional ( con - ventional ) design and frictional ( alternative ) design [ 132 ] . Frictional design tends to pump the breaks on production , bringing into play more critique , refection , and relationality [ Ibid ] . Frictional design here invokes Anna Tsing’s ethnographic investigation of frictions along global circuits of capital leading to non - scalability due to unexpected conjunctures , historical contingencies , and contact across vast diference [ 169 ] . It also relates to Laura Forlano and Anijo Mathew’s work on how design friction can tease out tensions rather than look to solve urban problems with techno - solutions [ 41 ] . Meanwhile , progressional design tendencies often converge toward techno - solutionism—or what Evgeny Morozov describes as the recasting of complex social problems into “neatly defned problems with defnite , computable solutions [ . . . ] if only the right algorithms are in place ! ” [ 119 ] . Progressional design progresses , indeed , with arrowy techniques like design thinking and the UK De - sign Council’s four - stage double diamond design ( DDD ) framework [ 25 ] , which break design into linear phases to efciently “deliver” products , as practiced at institutions like the Stanford d . school and IDEO [ 25 , 133 ] . However , this alleged progression comes at a cost . As Lilly Irani has noted , design thinking—a concept forged by Silicon Valley frms to meet global competitive pressures—relies upon racialized and capitalist forms of expertise that support “chas - ing innovation” [ 83 , 84 ] . This starkly contrasts with how frictional design embraces inefciency and slowness . James Pierce describes this divide of design tendencies as a “general rift” in the feld [ 132 ] . But what about design processes that are not clearly cut on one side or the other in contexts that call for a design to progress urgently , but with frictional tendencies ? What happens when a process has to oscillate between progressional and frictional design to rapidly respond , but also tread carefully—then what side of the rift is it on ? How does the process evolve ? What techniques are involved ? How might technoculture reinforce normative notions of time ? These are outstanding questions regarding the temporality of design ten - dencies . As scholars have yet to examine an oscillation between fast and slow community - based design , we trace this temporal tension . 3 METHODOLOGY In rethinking time and technology in community - based design , we take a refexive ethnographic approach [ 50 , 145 ] . We conduct multimodal qualitative research by immersing ourselves within the AEMP and refecting upon our participation in a three year - long engagement to collaboratively design the Covid - 19 Housing Story Map [ 138 , 139 ] . While McElroy co - founded the AEMP and its San Francisco Bay Area chapter in 2013 and has continued to colead its eforts to date , Halperin joined the New York City chapter while living there in 2020 to lead design eforts for the Covid - 19 Housing Story Map . This sub - project began at the onset of the Coronavirus pandemic in March 2020 to track the shifting landscape of emer - gency housing protection legislation , new and ongoing coalitional work , evictions , mutual aid , and direct action . The project also began to produce oral histories of tenant experiences regarding Covid - 19 - induced housing precarity . The project was neither in - tended , nor did it become , an academic project . It emerged as a grassroots response to urgent community needs for an aggregated source of emerging housing data and records of tenant experiences . During this pandemic conjuncture , Halperin and McElroy , along with an initial team of over a dozen AEMP volunteers , convened virtual meetings to adhere to Covid - 19 social distancing protocols . Unlike most AEMP projects , this one was born digital with vol - unteers based in various localities since all meetings were remote . Volunteers cycled in and out over time based on their capacities to support research , software development , design , critical cartogra - phy , translation , community conversations , and oral history . About half of the volunteers ( including ourselves ) were involved from inception and remain active participants today . The team initially met at least once and often several times per week , where we took hundreds of pages of notes . Most were taken for practical purposes in terms of moving the design forward and facilitating collaboration . We each also took individual notes related to our respective tasks . 2473 DIS ’23 , July 10 – 14 , 2023 , Pitsburgh , PA , USA Halperin & McElroy Further , we interviewed members of several community partner housing organizations whom we continued to consult with through - out the design process . These included organizations ranging from Tenants Together in California to a direct action mutual aid collec - tive in Rome , Italy . Not all partners were necessarily in community with each other , but were all grounded in shared political commit - ments to housing justice , and we have built sustained relationships with them through this . Based upon initial interviews with them , we produced design materials such as annotated wireframes and visual mockup iterations . To support our refexive analyses , we consult these records of the design process . Although the project has gradually eased in lockstep with the pandemic , it has not con - cluded ; much work still remains . Thus , our analyses are time - boxed from the start of the project ( March 2020 ) to the time of writing this paper in early 2023 : an approximately three - year time - frame . To make the map , we facilitated co - design activities with ten - ants , activists , housing organizations , policymakers , and many oth - ers across California and beyond . These activities included semi - structured interviews , testing sessions , and design reviews at AEMP meetings , where we presented wireframes , visual mockups , and interactive prototypes to our project team and partners for feed - back . We also attended coalition meetings about housing injustice through networks that we are a part of such as the San Francisco Anti - Displacement Coalition and the Regional Tenant Organizing Network to inform the design . Following numerous iterations and horizontal decision - making , the existing state of the Covid - 19 Hous - ing Story Map refers to a website that is two maps in one system . We designed a two - tab structure that contains a global housing protection legislation and housing justice actions map on one page ( Fig . 2 ) , as well as an oral history and evictions map on the other page ( Fig . 1 ) . Below , we elaborate on the data in each page . On the protections page ( Fig . 2 ) , the geospatial point data repre - sents actions that were generated via a crowdsourced survey on the site and translated into multiple languages . Through the survey , ten - ants submitted information about rent strikes , building occupations and squats , mutual aid solidarity actions , and eviction struggles . The geospatial polygon data on the same page were generated through a survey , but primarily supplied through our own research team , in which AEMP members conducted extensive research about housing protections and eviction moratoria being enacted in cities , counties , states , and countries globally . We assessed the strength of various policies and tracked their changes over time as moratoria expired , weakened , and shifted . We merged the database holding this re - search with polygon shapefles to represent counties , states , and countries geographically , while cities remained circular points . This culminated in one of two map designs within the unifed system . While the protections page is a global map , the oral histories and evictions page is US - based ( Fig . 1 ) . The stories were collected from one - on - one interviews with tenants and stored as audio fles , which volunteers translated , summarized , and transcribed as part of the AEMP’s double - consent oral history methodology [ 131 , 135 ] . The corresponding eviction data supplied on this page were generated by our research team , following the same geographic schema of polygons and points from our protections page . With all data hosted on one web domain , the double pagination ( the two maps ) refects the temporal nature of how the project as a whole evolved . Through - out the rest of the paper , we explore the process and challenges around how this bifurcated design came about over time . In refecting upon our design process , we draw inspiration from refexive ethnography to consider our stances as both researchers and project participants [ 145 ] . Our approach aligns with ongoing anthropological practices of collaborative and collective ethnogra - phy that move beyond the confnes of participant observation to think more deeply about reciprocity , embeddedness , and group and individual relations [ 23 , 93 , 146 ] . We also draw inspiration from the tradition of frst - person refections on design processes that excavate insights via refexivity [ 3 , 7 , 24 , 26 , 27 , 175 ] —often retro - spectively [ 77 , 79 , 80 ] . It is precisely these modes of refecting upon and tracing the past to connect it to the present and future that makes refexive ethnography apt for exploring temporality [ 77 , 88 ] . We analyze our ethnographic materials and refections by draw - ing inspiration from Adele Clarke’s situated mapping techniques ; we examine how our positions , relations , and social arenas inform our temporal experiences of the design process [ 21 ] . While both authors have participated in many AEMP projects ( some of which McElroy has ethnographically chronicled over 10 - years ) , our anal - yses focus on the temporal tensions entangled with the Covid - 19 Housing Story Map [ 138 , 139 ] to understand how time unfolded in a particular moment of the AEMP’s now decade - long life . 4 FINDINGS Through ethnographic refection , here we seek to address : what temporal tensions were entangled in our community - based design process ? We fnd that our Covid - 19 Housing Story Map [ 138 , 139 ] embodies four temporal tensions around data , pacing , storytelling , and tooling . The frst tension involves the temporal information that we mapped in real time amid a continuously evolving landscape of data in fux ( budding versus expiring eviction moratoria , evictions accumulating , and resistance growing ) . The second pertains to the pace of our community - based design practice as we aimed to balance rapid response with careful community - building . The third temporal tension concerns the time - based media lifecycle— sustaining storytelling , from digital production to preservation . The fourth encapsulates the tooling trade - ofs that we were forced to make for sake of expediency , but with unresolved hesitations and comprised values . Across these four temporal tensions , we look at how normative notions of time unfold by examining their underlying social practices , as well as their surrounding political , economic , and cultural forces tied to technology . 4 . 1 Evolving Data Landscape : Visualizing and Revisualizing Temporal Information From its inception , the Covid - 19 Housing Story Map was designed to track and visualize temporal data in fux at national , state , county , and city levels : emerging and expiring housing protection legisla - tion , growing housing justice actions to resist weak protections , tenant resources ( e . g . , rent relief programs ) , impending evictions , and oral histories of tenant experiences . In this section , we trace the temporal context of this ever - changing data and then describe how we visualized—and revisualized—the time - sensitive data amid shifting timelines tied to the uncertain duration of the viral spread . 2474 Temporal Tensions in Digital Story Mapping for Housing Justice DIS ’23 , July 10 – 14 , 2023 , Pitsburgh , PA , USA Figure 2 : Covid - 19 Housing Story Map : Global Housing Protection Legislation & Housing Justice Actions tab [ 138 ] Despite longstanding violent histories of dispossession preced - ing Covid - 19 displacement , the nexus of health and housing crises accelerated by the pandemic presented new threats with little to no policy remedies , despite an estimated 30 - 40 million people at risk of eviction in the US alone [ 11 ] . While pandemic - exacerbated housing precarity laid bare unresolvable matters of life - and - death under racial capitalism , powerful organizing nevertheless did and continues to transpire through forms of mutual aid , rent strikes , securing shelter for people who are unhoused , and more . Mean - while , early on into the pandemic , nonprofts and legislators pushed by those working on the frontlines began to legislate a series of eviction moratoriums—something that we , as housing organizers , had been dreaming up long before Covid - 19 . While moratoria , at the end of the day , were not as powerful as organizers had hoped , protections did aford many with relief . That said , because policies were being added and amended on city , county , state , and national levels globally with unique time constraints and expiration dates , it became increasingly difcult for tenants and housing organizers to track policies and document forms of resistance . As the virus spread to no clear end , its impact on housing continued to shift . The Covid - 19 Housing Story Map was born in March 2020 with a team of about a dozen part - time volunteers united around the initial goal of providing spatial data to support community part - ners in California and New York . However , soon enough , the scope enlarged as we joined with partners in other parts of the US and the globe , namely Romania , Brasil , and Italy , who also contributed to our eforts . Furthermore , as what became a growing patchwork of policies that failed to adequately protect many tenants , housing justice actions ranging from rent striking to squatting also surfaced globally . In response , we started recording these global acts of re - sistance as place - based coalition data points . AEMP oral historians also started documenting tenant experiences as the crisis intensifed . In aggregating the evolving data landscape of policies and evictions , while crowd - sourcing information of housing justice actions and collecting oral histories , our digital story mapping eforts informed by multiple partners became a multi - scalar community - based de - sign endeavor far beyond what we had anticipated . We frst began by tracking and ranking the protections ( e . . g , evic - tion moratoria ) , while aggregating tenant resources and mapping housing justice actions retrieved through a crowd - sourced form . This frst page maps the protections and resources on city , county , state , and national scales ( Fig . 2 ) . Once housing protections started to expire , mapping stories and eviction counts in the US ( where our collective is primarily based ) became the new focus . As this shifting focus required more complex architecture , we confgured a two - pronged tab structure to allow for housing all Covid - 19 related data in one digital place ( as opposed to building another website ) , all the while mediating cognitive load through the bifurcated pages . 2475 DIS ’23 , July 10 – 14 , 2023 , Pitsburgh , PA , USA Halperin & McElroy On the global protections page , we designed interactions for users to learn about policies based upon our own research and a crowd - sourcing form by clicking on polygons with a sequential grey - scale color scheme that corresponds with policy strength rankings . The ranking was based on a schematic that we devised to assess impact on stopping evictions . We represented expired policies with a cross - hatch pattern overlaying the polygons . Housing justice actions were recorded as point data with icons rendered as red homes with chimneys in the shape of lightning bolts . These design decisions supported our data visualization eforts early on in the pandemic . As protections expired and evictions accelerated , on the oral history page ( Fig . 1 ) , we represented eviction data based on our own research as interactive light red polygons . Meanwhile , the oral histories appear as animated bright red icons ( pulsating location vectors ) that , upon interaction , open a pop - up window with an audiovisual media player . The navigation menu at the top connects the two pages , as well as provides interactions for accessing re - sources , viewing additional tenant - generated stories ( collected in a separate project with other community partners ) , and adding data to contribute to crowdsourcing . With crowdsourced additive features in which people can add content within or beyond borders , we attempted to refute the atemporal static nature of map - making . The map was crafted as not merely a tool to use or exploit , but rather as a co - creative audio - visual experience to refect commu - nity values surrounding aesthetics and politics . For instance , at a housing and disability justice meeting that one of us attended , a disability activist mentioned how designs for disabled people are often void of aesthetics and overly clinical not in a superfcial way , but in an insidious “othering” kind of way . We thus worked against this design norm in storytelling about housing and disability justice . Similarly , when one Oakland - based tenant who shared their story provided feedback on the map design , they exclaimed appreciation for the thought and care that went into the aesthetic representation in particular . Another tenant also expressed afnity for its “ dark and apocalyptic ” look and feel because it refected the moment in time . We sought not to recreate just another serene blue and green map that many technology companies unimaginatively reproduce , but rather subvert that aesthetic to refect the reality of the dire land - scape : a pandemic - exacerbated housing crisis . By visualizing data with concern for aesthetics and politics , we worked to intervene in the static and atemporal nature of normative cartography , which fxes places , people , and lifeworlds into ready - made containers . By design , we aimed to resist the violence of state - sanctioned borders and territorial containment as best we could given time and labor constraints . One pillar of our community agreement speaks to how we collectively understood that “ properties ” only “ exist in the context of unceded territories of original populations and histories of colonial and imperial theft . ” As such , we had numerous debates as to how to engage with base - maps , boundaries , and topographies linked to colonial geographies . One of our project members from Brasil also made a point that most base - map options spelled the country as “Brazil , ” reinforcing Anglo language hegemony [ 121 ] . While we drew inspiration from anticolonial map - makers such as Native Land Digital [ 28 ] who visualize topographies in their Indigenous names and territories , we realized that the housing policies that we were visualizing existed within the imperial and nationalist boundaries of the state . Further , the last thing we wanted to do was include Native place names to be performative or divorced from ongoing landback movements ( a critique that Iralu makes of Google’s cooptation of Native labels [ 82 ] ) . Given this alongside time and labor constraints , we resigned to mobilizing colonial and / or nationalist labels already built into open sourced base - map tiles . With that said , we implemented some smaller , more manageable design decisions intended to reduce harms . For example , we chose a base - map that did not display or aestheticize the labels in plain sight ; the names only appear when clicking on or searching for a colonial and / or nationally - defned place - name . The base - map that we chose also did not represent non - US countries with US - based spellings , even when hovered or clicked upon . When we tested the map , we found that users were still able to retrieve the necessary data . Finally , we added a pop - up modal with a land acknowledgment statement that describes our limitations and appears as the frst interaction when loading the protections map . While this far - from - reparative modal conceived under time and resource constraints toys with performative , it recognizes the harms that imperial cartography has long imposed through map design . Perhaps with more time , we could have chosen a better or diferent way to trouble colonial and nationalist cartography , while also providing policy information . 4 . 2 Pace of Practice : Balancing Rapid Response with Careful Community - Building By forming a set of community agreements , the Covid - 19 Hous - ing Map team committed to carefully practicing design and engi - neering at a particular pace . In one sense , this entailed applying design methods and frameworks grounded in refexivity , critical - ity , relationality , and care . In another sense , it entailed rejecting user - centered design methods and frameworks misaligned with our community context . While the latter techniques like design sprints , rapid prototyping / ethnography , and design thinking crossed our minds as convenient short - cuts with linear phase - based timelines to ensure efciency , we deemed them at too far odds with the community agreement that we had established . We had agreed to move relatively slowly and to practice an ethics of care with par - ticular methods . Below , we unpack four pillars of our community agreement that encapsulate these concerns . While such points fore - grounded our values at the onset , we soon found that they were in tension with our needs to urgently respond to the severity of the crisis , as well as difcult to enforce in practice as Silicon Valley technoculture infltrated the project at several conjunctures . One pillar of our community agreement directly spoke to pacing and expanding the tool in sync with community partners . It reads : We intend to move at the speed of our relationships with housing justice organizations . As a result , we will only expand our tool to geographies where we have relationships , and we will move slowly and follow the pace of our collaborators . This pillar was established in light of how those of us working on the project embodied the passage of time as Covid - 19 demands grew . In these eforts to “ follow the pace ” of community partners but also “ move slowly , ” we found a severe contradiction that manifested as oscillating between slow and fast design . We faced a temporal tension between moving as fast as possible to respond urgently to 2476 Temporal Tensions in Digital Story Mapping for Housing Justice DIS ’23 , July 10 – 14 , 2023 , Pitsburgh , PA , USA crisis versus gradually building trust by patiently working out and understanding how we could best support our community partners . While this ethic around pacing has worked in prior projects , it proved to be particularly difcult with the evolving data landscape and unrelenting crisis . As eviction moratoria ended , got re - amended , and fuctuated while the needs and requests of our community partners escalated as the virus continued to wreak havoc , we , as volunteers , struggled to keep up . We also struggled to quell the kinds of “move fast and break things” practices that seeped into the project . By moving slowly to carefully tend to relations , we adhered to one part of our agreement but not to matching the pace of our partners who seemed to be moving faster . This risked failing to meet the moment . In wake of the urgent community partner requests and tenants facing immediate landlord abuse , harassment , and eviction , treading too slowly presented clear consequences . We encountered time as paradoxical since both paces conficted and surfaced positive and negative consequences . Although we worked as fast as we could as volunteers juggling many other responsibilities , we tried to stay grounded in our community agreement and values . Despite pressures to accelerate our design process , we remained committed to other pillars of our agreement that spoke to our meth - ods and values of practice—that is , until Silicon Valley design and technology practices infltrated the project on two separate occa - sions . One of these core pillars of the agreement reads as follows : We aim to practice nonviolent communication within our meetings , online communication , and more . We un - derstand that we all have diferent skills , backgrounds , abilities , and life experiences , and avoid condescension and hierarchical knowledge production . Instead , we aim to share plural forms of knowledge through generative , feminist , antiracist , and decolonial methods . With this pillar , we explicated how we wanted to collaborate with clear implications around how design and engineering ought to be practiced methodologically . Much of this corresponded to AEMP’s broader politics , which are rooted in dismantling Silicon Valley technocapitalist , white , sexist , and heteronormative cultures and cartographic methods in our own work and relations . It has also meant situating current housing justice struggles within a deeper history of resistance against colonial and racial capitalist housing economies ( e . g . , [ 110 , 130 ] ) . The AEMP’s recent atlas project , for instance , maintained a partnership with groups such as the Ohlone - led Sogorea Te’ Land Trust in the Bay Area who are actively seeking to rematriate stolen land and preserve Native Ohlone culture [ 59 ] . Other work has sought to decenter presentist San Francisco and Oakland geographies from broader Bay Area housing struggles , and to de - spectacularize Silicon Valley from all conversations regarding technology and infrastructure ( e . g . , [ 136 , 137 ] ) . But this proved to be all the more difcult amid the urgencies and perils of the crisis . Even with our community agreement prioritizing a particular set of methods and frameworks , we found limitations in maintaining it . We had not established ways of vetting volunteers’ practices . As a scrappy grassroots volunteer project , we did not have ample time , resources , people - power , or infrastructure to confgure procedures for safe - guarding the project’s integrity . We already struggled to meet the urgency of the crisis and its ever - mutating form . Mean - while , those who brought patriarchal , racist , capitalist , and colonial methods into the project found ways to latch onto the agreement without refecting about their own privileges and reproduction of Silicon Valley technocultures of meritocracy ( see [ 123 ] ) . At one point , a volunteer engineer who worked for a big technology frm in Silicon Valley installed software development hierarchies and corporate project management with “scrum master” protocols to manage workfow efciency . These practices disrupted our project . While the AEMP maintains a recruitment protocol to ensure that we bring in members with aligned values , it became increas - ingly difcult to do this well during the pandemic as we became inundated with an unprecedented number of volunteers seeking to help—not to mention a host of new projects ( the Covid - 19 Housing Map only being one ) . We also experienced people who had worked with us previously but disappeared and reappeared as the aug - mented housing crisis required an unprecedented response . This meant that the volunteers comprising our Covid - 19 mapping team were for the most part new to working together , minus a few core members who had been with the AEMP consistently for some time . Thus when one project member new to the team began espousing Silicon Valley technoculture in our meeting spaces , it led to numer - ous confusions and tensions . Soon enough , many project members found the practices to be oppressive and disconnected from com - munity organizing values and contexts . This further violated our other pillar that grounded an ethics of care : “As a community of developers , researchers , and community organizers we aim to treat each other with respect , love , and dignity , and do not tolerate any harmful behavior . ” Ironically , the Silicon Valley worker latched onto this pillar to avoid confict and to silent those who felt harmed by his actions . To re - ground our project , we had to pause all generative work and re - allocate our entire team’s time to mediate strained relations until ultimately asking him to leave for repeated ofenses . 4 . 3 Time - Based Media Lifecycle : Sustaining Storytelling , From Digital Production to Preservation We further encountered temporal tensions in the time - based media lifecycle , from digital production to preservation of oral histories . Despite our best intentions , it was not long before disruptive Silicon Valley practices like design thinking reentered the project through a partnership with Stanford University . Before this regress , however , we did have a fruitful Stanford partnership . In what follows , we describe how the story map engages time - based media and then comparatively analyze two classroom partnerships with Stanford , examining the tensions in sustaining storytelling . Around the same time that the housing protections side of the map launched , AEMP oral historians started producing digital sto - ries of tenant experiences of the pandemic . These stories , primarily in the form of audio fles , are time - based media , meaning that they unfold over time . The stories span tenant narrators calling for basic human dignity amid an inhumane housing climate . For example , some tenants shared stories of their personal experiences inter - spersed with explications that “nobody should have to be homeless , ” as well as aforementioned intersections of housing and disabil - ity justice—and recurring experiences of landlord abuse , harass - ment , and retaliation . As AEMP oral historians worked to digi - tally produce these stories via a double - consent methodology to 2477 DIS ’23 , July 10 – 14 , 2023 , Pitsburgh , PA , USA Halperin & McElroy Figure 3 : Sample Covid - 19 oral histories of tenants based in the San Francisco Bay Area and Los Angeles , California , USA [ 139 ] safely elevate tenant voices by prioritizing security and privacy ( see [ 131 , 135 ] ) , we struggled to sustain storytelling eforts . At the onset of the pandemic , we needed enough volunteers to do oral history interviews with narrators and to transcribe and edit them . Many well - intended volunteers eagerly joined at frst , seeking to conduct interviews with narrators , but soon exited . This left us with a backlog of administrative tasks , editing , and transcription work that was needed to produce and disseminate the stories in support of our community partners working to overturn the false narratives . Not only was producing hour - long stories and cutting their time down to digestible clips stalled , but so was making them playable to foster collective listening as well as shift public consciousness . While overworking ourselves as a low - resourced team , we en - countered an opportunity to collaborate with the Stanford Univer - sity Community - Engaged Learning Program through the Depart - ment of Urban Studies as one way to increase project support . This opportunity came through a member of the AEMP and former com - munity organizer , Deland Chan , who at the time was directing the program and teaching an urban studies course for undergraduates to engage in community - based projects . In fact , we had worked with Chan’s class as early as 2014 in conceptualizing our frst oral history map , Narratives of Displacement and Resistance [ 134 ] . We were excited for another opportunity to work with her class during the pandemic . In producing our Covid 19 Housing Story Map , we 2478 Temporal Tensions in Digital Story Mapping for Housing Justice DIS ’23 , July 10 – 14 , 2023 , Pitsburgh , PA , USA had the backlog of recorded oral histories to digitally produce and embed on the map . As part of the design process , we had previously conducted semi - structured interviews with community organizers who emphasized the importance of being able to disseminate indi - vidual stories—not just a link to the entire map of stories . So , we wrote a design brief for seven of Chan’s students to help us build out an audio - visual media player on the map with this function , as well as to support transcription , editing , and outreach to narrators . This partnership seemed to be a mutually - benefcial collabora - tion . We taught the students skills and theories surrounding this work . The students helped us produce stories and make them more expressive and shareable per our community partner requests . Em - bracing a critical lens , the students read articles that we suggested to learn about our work . They also helped reduce our production backlog and develop our design of an audio - visual media player with a button to generate unique links for each story . This media player provided stop , play , fast forward , and rewind controls for users to toy with the dimension of time . With stories live on the map , the time then came to focus on disseminating them to foster listening online and at activist conferences . Time - based media , af - ter all , invokes temporal elements such as duration and historicity , while also raising questions regarding conservation and restoration . We thus began to ponder how the recorded stories could have lives beyond the Covid - 19 era by being well - preserved and sustained as other oral histories often are . While struggling to address the present and future circumstances of these stories , another oppor - tunity to partner with Stanford surfaced , which appealed to our immediate need for additional support until it relapsed the project . Another organization at Stanford , the Computer Science for So - cial Good Studio , heard about our partnership with Chan’s class and contacted us , requesting a similar arrangement . This time , we wrote a design brief about how we were looking for support in thinking through a digital preservation and sustainability plan for the AEMP’s archival collection of stories . We were wary of how Stanford institutions like the d . school have historically propagated hasty practices void of critique and refexivity such as design think - ing , as well as inficted harm including that of Silicon Valley regional gentrifcation ( e . g . [ 176 ] ) . However , when some of us voiced these concerns to the studio , a student instructor assured us of the “social good” focus that promised to be diferent . While trying to embrace and move at the speed of trust , we decided to partake in what we had hoped would be an opportunity to receive timely development and digital archiving support , plus an opportunity to mentor stu - dents . In our mapping meetings , we deliberated about the merits of engaging in this partnership . On one hand , we were wary , but on the other , we considered this a way to support the critical de - sign education of future technologists in the region , even if the partnership turned out not to be materially “productive” in the end . To facilitate the classroom partnership , we prepared another list of readings about the AEMP and critical design ( e . g . , Lilly Irani’s work on design thinking [ 83 ] ) . Yet , the students either did not read or heed to the texts . Instead , they established a distant client re - lationship with us rather than an integrated collaboration , while immediately racing toward a mobile app - like “solution , ” despite our plea not to make an app . Incompatible practices grounded in Silicon Valley techno - culture seeped into the project yet again . Ultimately , the students “delivered” what appeared to be an artifact derived from a design thinking process of performative post - it noting ( e . g . , [ 106 ] ) and rapid prototyping : a shiny , yet not usable ( never mind sustainable ) artifact that failed to address our design brief about digital preservation . After apologizing for this , the student instruc - tor promised to rectify the misuse of our time and energy . Yet , he ignored follow up emails and the work that we requested help with was left undone . In short , the students parachuted in from the Sili - con Valley region with design thinking to “deliver” a rapid output that met their goals for the quarter , but not those of our collective . Ironically , our attempt to educate , share skills , and include more helping hands in thinking through the digital afterlife of story maps further derailed us from our community groundedness . 4 . 4 Tooling Trade - Ofs : Negotiating Values and Needs for Expedient Technologies Throughout the project , we grappled with the need to negotiate our values and needs for expedient technologies to collectively construct our digital story map . Here , we found recurring trade - ofs , whereby the tools that seemed to ofer us the greatest ease of use and efciency also seemed to most severely compromise our values . In this section , we explore how we encountered and wrestled with these trade - ofs as the crisis intensifed , pressuring us to respond in a timely manner despite our best intentions to stay committed to the values put forth in our community agreement . Throughout our community agreement , we expressed commit - ment to , in the words of one pillar , “ choosing non - corporate tools and platforms . ” This pillar was further contextualized by recognizing how software developers who carry certain privileges in selecting tools ought to foster skill - sharing and “ actively work to prevent hierarchical divisions between tech / non - tech collaborators . ” Since this map was computationally intensive , we wanted to ensure that soft - ware developers would not over - determine the decision - making , especially in terms of how we foreground particular values in the implementation of a geographic information system ( GIS ) . Many corporate GIS tools tend to support ( or at least exhibit complicity in ) spatial injustice , exploit user privacy , and contribute to many other societal harms ( e . g . , [ 55 , 111 , 121 , 137 ] ) . We therefore intended to avert using corporate tools in our map - making , as well as in our communication and organizing endeavors that could compromise the project’s overarching mission and integrity . Another pillar of our community agreement was written to ad - dress our concerns around the technologies that we use to support our mapping , storytelling , and organizing . It reads as follows : We recognize the seriousness of the housing crisis and the consequences of corporate land and computational infrastructure control and ownership . We aim to ensure that our work refects the gravity of the situation and does not trivialize or erase the violence of evictions and gentrifcation , nor the dangers of depending on corpo - rate platforms for our communication and organizing . With this articulation , we wanted to use not - for - proft and open - source tools or build our own ones from scratch , but that proved to be much easier said than done . At the onset , a team of mostly developers quickly built the map shown in Fig . 4 with Leafet , an open source JavaScript library , to support a single web - page . As the crisis and scope of data collection escalated , however , more 2479 DIS ’23 , July 10 – 14 , 2023 , Pitsburgh , PA , USA Halperin & McElroy Figure 4 : Initial pre - design state ( April 2020 ) : a single web - page built with Leafet before undergoing an intensive design process sophisticated software design and front - end frameworks had to be integrated , and thus the code had to be refactored . While already us - ing corporate tools such as Github to support development , as well as Google Drive and Slack to manage our communications ( despite our intentions not to ) , we ended up using a host of corporate tools to make the map more robust for similarly practical reasons . On the back - end , we integrated CartoDB for geospatial data , Netlify for hosting the website , and Airtable for narrative data manage - ment . As for the front - end , we used React and Redux as the main framework for creating design components and managing dynamic state information . We also used HTML for the basis and SCSS for styling , while Leafet remained in tact for the base - map . Jest was also utilized for unit testing and i18next for language localization . Although we hesitated before refactoring the code with these cor - porate tools , we concluded that this map would only be useful to our community partners if it actually worked with coherent infor - mation architecture . Thus , we exchanged some of our values for the ability to swiftly produce the map in the heat of the pandemic without delaying it by indefnitely searching for alternative tools that would not necessarily even pan out to be feasible or afordable for our low - resourced collective for a plethora of reasons . Time constraints also meant that some of our values and priori - ties such as accessibility and language justice became in confict with what was technologically possible for our small team to de - velop . As the initial state of the map reveals in Fig . 4 , much of the design was not accessible . By redesigning it , however , we worked to prioritize and improve the accessibility within our means , albeit imperfect . For instance , we implemented extra large buttons , high color contrast ratios , color blind safety , and a responsive design to support mobile users in and beyond the US ( Fig . 5 ) . Translators also confgured the map in 12 diferent languages to make it accessible for tenants who may not speak English in the US or other countries where we were mapping , redressing the hegemony of the English language . Herein was another temporal and technological tension tied to language justice . Volunteers manually translated the materi - als to ensure proper communication , and address concerns around how features like Google Translate surveil and commoditize such content . One of our project members , Luis Felipe Murillo , led an efort to use the open source database system Reclus to materialize translations with community partners globally . The goal was to make translation accessible and free from predatory companies , and to make the map’s crowdsourcing function available through the Tor network to avoid surveillance ( see [ 121 ] ) . Much of this efort was coordinated with our collaborators from the counter - cartography group , kollektiv orangotango , who have also refected upon the importance of avoiding corporate software in mapping the international housing landscapes amid the pandemic ( see [ 154 ] ) . To support all the translations on the front - end of the map , we also needed to select typefaces that were available in a multitude of languages . Soon enough , we realized that corporate entities like Google and IBM were the ones who readily provided this , while the lesser - known typefaces designed by independent type designers did not . For this reason , we primarily used corporate typography like Noto Sans and IBM Plex Mono , which were available in more 2480 Temporal Tensions in Digital Story Mapping for Housing Justice DIS ’23 , July 10 – 14 , 2023 , Pitsburgh , PA , USA Figure 5 : Wireframes and visual mockups of responsive design to support mobile devices than enough languages given their international business objec - tives . However , with this decision came not only aesthetic concerns around politics ( e . g , [ 14 ] ) , but also concerns in terms of how Google Fonts , for instance , stands to proft of our usage , which was in - tended to resist the very displacement that the technology company contributes to in the San Francisco Bay Area with its infrastructure . Thus , all of these design enhancements—ranging from accessibility to multi - language support—required appropriating corporate tools and compromising our values in a number of ways . With no clear way around this dilemma that far exceeded what we had expected when forming the community agreement before the scope metasta - sized , we were not prepared to prioritize abstinence from corporate tools over our values such as accessibility and language justice . In reluctantly trading in some of our values for expediency to make the map useful and usable in a timely manner , we committed to another pillar of our agreement that refects a tension and contra - diction . On one hand , considering the map as a sum of many tools , including corporate ones , questions the integrity of it . On the other hand , when looking at the bigger picture of the map , we see that appropriating corporate tools does not have to mean recreating its technocultural imaginaries . We also see that prioritizing organizers’ needs for immediate support is paramount . This pillar reads : We are not here to simply create a ‘cool’ tech tool ; we are here to support community organizing according to the Anti - Eviction Mapping Project’s mission . Our work is guided by the needs of housing justice groups and organizers on the ground . To the extent possible , we strive to prioritize the needs of organizers building Black - Indigenous - People - of - Color autonomy and self - determination . We thus committed to creating the digital story map not for the sake of making a technological object , but rather something utilitarian to support on - the - ground housing justice eforts . Many housing organizers reluctantly use corporate tools ranging from corporate - controlled social media to Google Drive because they , too , often do not have the time or resources to forage for alternatives that may require elite technological expertise and not even work well . As we looked to prioritize the urgent community needs , we concluded that trying to fnd and experiment with more value - aligned alternatives detracted too signifcantly from providing immediate support to our partners . Meanwhile , even prospective alternatives presented their own host of feasibility and accessibility limitations in terms of facilitating community input and control . Building tools from scratch would have taken us far too long even if we had the infras - tructural resources to do so . But herein lies the unresolved temporal tension tied to our project : a reluctant trade - of between our values as a housing justice collective and our needs for expediency and accessibility in order to produce useful technology for organizing against the corporate control of housing and the housing policies . 5 DISCUSSION Through refexive ethnographic work , we have examined tempo - rality in our community - based digital story mapping for housing justice engagement . By turning inward to interrogate our experi - ences as researchers and participants ( rather than turning outward with a user study as more commonly done ) , we have found subtle , yet signifcant temporal tensions entangled with our data , pacing , storytelling , and tooling . We have encountered an evolving data landscape that required visualizing and revisualizing temporal infor - mation ; a pace of practice that struggled to balance rapid response with careful community - building ; a time - based media lifecycle that vied to sustain storytelling , from digital production to preservation ; and inevitable tooling trade - ofs that meant negotiating values and needs for expediency . Since we have uncovered these insights over 2481 DIS ’23 , July 10 – 14 , 2023 , Pitsburgh , PA , USA Halperin & McElroy three years , we now fnd ourselves in positions to further refect upon and synthesize lessons learned . Our critical refection has not only enabled us to reconsider our own roles , methods , and frame - works , but also time and technology in community - based design more broadly . In what follows , we refect upon how community - based designers might navigate temporal tensions like the ones that we encountered by mindfully designing with temporal pres - ence , making the past present through digital storytelling , and reimagining technological relations along the long arc of justice . 5 . 1 Mindfully Designing with Time Based on our community engagement , we learn that mindfully designing with time—being and staying present with temporal presence—is one way to conscientiously navigate temporal tensions in the design process . By designing “with time , ” we do not only refer to the literal signifcance of the colloquial expression , meaning as time passes and happens or changes gradually . We also mean work - ing with time as malleable material that echos Sandjar Kozubaev and colleagues’ call for more metaphorical thinking around tem - porality as culturally - situated [ 90 ] . We also call for recognizing time’s presence like that of a person , extending how Howell and colleagues personify speculation in resistance to normative time [ 78 ] . Consider how in participatory community engagements de - signers make concerted eforts to design with those who the tool will afect [ 66 , 72 , 73 ] . In such cases , designers actively engage com - munity members in the design process , as opposed to designing for or even inadvertently against them [ 98 , 173 , 177 ] ( e . g . , by operating on universalist assumptions [ 148 ] ) . It is this frame of designing with that we call on for thinking about time in community contexts , particularly when urgent needs give rise to temporal contradictions that call for both slowing down to exert care and speeding up when a timely yet imperfect response is more efective than no response . Rather than approaching time as a universalized , static , or passive force by not recognizing its pliable presence ; or an uncontrollable force by operating at the whim of it ; or an antagonistic force by going against it ( e . g . , “racing against the clock” ) , we suggest that designers work with time . In our process amid crisis , this meant navigating the crossroads between fast [ 117 , 166 ] and slow design [ 49 , 163 ] : balancing rapid response and careful community - building . It also meant oscillating between what James Pierce frames as a “rift” between progressional and frictional design [ 132 ] by halting production design , at times , to enact critical , refexive design . Recall how when a volunteer engineer violated our community agreement we took a step back to critically refect and work to facilitate confict resolution . While it felt as though we were setting ourselves back from meeting the urgent material needs of our community partners at the time , we see in retrospect that this exemplifes what it means to design with time in a community - based process : to ( re ) calibrate time when ( if not before ) values and trust relations—the very core of community , solidarity , and movements—may be compromised . In rethinking time as malleable and personifed , while also rec - ognizing that the design process happens with time , designers may be able to exert greater control over the entropy ensued from ex - ternal pressures and threats such as a pandemic - exacerbated crisis . By recognizing the design process itself as temporal—as gradually happening or changing—designers may be more prepared to han - dle and adapt their processes to circumstances like the evolving data landscape that we encountered . Consider how temporal me - dia , as Janet Murray defnes it in relation to interaction design , involves direct manipulation of time with playback controls [ 122 ] . By designing with time , designers may then operate fgurative play - back controls to fast - forward , rewind , pause , and play their design practice . Conceiving of playback controls such as these may help designers calibrate and re - calibrate the process in real - time . Recog - nizing “controls” such as pause—as Batya Friedman and Daisy Yoo have conceptualized its rhythms [ 47 ] —as well as rewind can help designers slow down and take necessary steps back from “move fast and break things” practices that can seep into and over - determine ( if not guide ) [ 13 , 165 , 172 ] technological projects , even in digital story mapping for housing justice . Ultimately , we were not able to accomplish all that we had hoped in time largely because we had to allocate so much time to understanding what was happening in our design process . We hope that the knowledge and vocabulary that we now have around these tensions can allow us and others to work through contradictions with time as a resource and recourse . 5 . 2 Making the Past Present through Digital Storytelling Based on our engagement , we see potential for designers to tran - scend the normative notions of time by working to make the past present through digital storytelling—that is , remembering the past and understanding that it is present . In our story map design , this meant foregrounding the ways that colonial and racial capitalist his - tories haunt the Covid - 19 - era landscape , as well as documenting the tenant stories that present counter - narratives to the age - old tropes of housing insecurity that center on victim - blaming and shaming residents [ 178 ] . In other community contexts working toward so - cial justice , designers then may take take similar steps to utilize digital storytelling , as Lydia Michie , Jill Dimond , and colleagues do to not only reject the “false narratives , ” but also expose the realities [ 115 ] and shift collective consciousness around prevailing narra - tives [ 30 ] . To support these kinds of eforts , Daniela Rosner , for instance , conceptualizes critical fabulations as narrative tactics for foregrounding subaltern histories ; in particular , Rosner presents “recuperations” as a tactic ( borrowed from feminist speculative theorizing and bell hooks’ writing on radical aesthetics [ 76 ] ) for designers to revive hidden or absent stories [ 148 ] . Along with look - ing to the past , staying present is also important for designers . As Larissa Pschetz argues , homogenizing design as future - oriented can oversimplify the present in ways that disregard diferent commu - nities and realities [ 141 ] . Contemporary designs thus ought to not only work toward futures , but also work with the past and present . One way to do this in today’s digital landscape is to document counter - narratives that revitalize and render displaced histories visible , as our Covid - 19 Housing Story Map does with oral histories . Oral history in many ways epitomizes what it means to remem - ber and archive struggles that sanitized acts of memorialization elide . Meanwhile , digital technologies remediate oral storytelling traditions in ways that Jay David Bolter and Richard Grusin theo - rize [ 15 ] . As an illustrious example of this relation , we revisit the work of Nancy Mirabal . In producing a collaborative oral history 2482 Temporal Tensions in Digital Story Mapping for Housing Justice DIS ’23 , July 10 – 14 , 2023 , Pitsburgh , PA , USA project about gentrifcation in San Francisco’s Mission District , Mirabal writes that , despite the growing number of memorials in the city commemorating historical moments and fgures , there are never plaques or memorials dedicated to those evicted from their homes and neighborhoods [ 118 ] . The AEMP’s oral history focus was frst made in consultation with Mirabal back in 2014 , as we sought to similarly produce and digitize collaborative stories erased from normative archives of memorialization and deemed too unsa - vory for tourist consumption . In fact , we wanted to produce stories on digital maps that would discourage voyeuristic touristifcation and resultant dispossession [ 102 ] . This counter - narrative focus and mode of refashioning oral storytelling into digital formats has con - tinued to inform our narrative work through participatory mapping and artifact design , including in our Covid - 19 Housing Story Map . In the AEMP’s case , the digital oral histories of tenants’ present and ongoing housing struggles , including traumatic experiences of eviction , landlord abuse , and housing insecurity , refect a compli - cated series of past events with efects that extend into the future . Per Mirabal , there are no “memorials to a bygone time or concrete statues that speak of a past history and people , who once lived here . But there is a seething presence , a haunting if you will , that travels and moves through space , resting in the cracks of the sidewalks and waiting for what comes next” [ 118 ] . As Sarah Fox and Chris Le Dantec suggest , community histories can work to reclaim a shared sense of identity about the past that not only recognize current conditions , but also amplify local voices to motivate change [ 44 ] . By heeding to these kinds of temporal entanglements rather than operating in the present as if history is well in the past , designers can reshape the future of their communities . At the same time , following Eve Tuck [ 170 ] , we do not suggest reducing people to traumatic events or struggles . For this reason , we also highlight di - rect action , organizing , and acts of refusal [ 108 ] , as well as nostalgic memories of home and aesthetic sensory experiences of cities [ 66 ] that reject harm - centered analysis [ 170 ] . These acts , subtle or overt , create futures beyond those of dispossession and displacement . In community - led futuring , we argue against design tendencies that homogenize all people experiencing struggle as one singu - lar community . As Benedict Anderson’s work illustrates , maps and other forms of data collection such as censuses and museums have historically informed projects of nationalism , confning people into homogeneous empty time and formulate what he describes as “imagined communities” [ 2 ] . Maps , for instance , can fctionalize and fetishize community—what Debora de Castro Leal and colleagues recognize as “community fetishism” [ 95 ] . Community - based digital story mapping then can do just as much harm as good with its power to create false notions of cohesive groups of people and moments in time . Embracing conjunctural analysis [ 61 , 62 ] then lets us sit with the trouble [ 70 ] that digital story map - making can bring , and conceptualize a politics beyond simply that of representation . What might it mean to collectively create a map of counter - narratives that wishes to trouble reductive notions of time and of community ? 5 . 3 Reimagining Technological Relations Over Time Upon examining our community - based design process , we fnd un - resolved questions around how our relations with technology and technology - mediated relations with one another can work toward community justice . In wake of conjunctural crises , we sometimes resigned to using questionable tools that meant comprising our values of slowness to meet urgent needs . At times , we made imper - fect choices and deviated from our ideals of moving at a pace of care and trust grounded in community relations . This was in part due to having accepted the help of volunteers , ranging from a Sili - con Valley “scrum master” to design thinkers , whose technological relations further destabilized our already precarious project . In light of how our team expanded to create community - based technology synced with a changing moratoria landscape , we recog - nize the promises and perils of scholar - activism . As Ruth Wilson Gilmore warns against , projects that do not fully engage those subjected to the harms that the project seeks to organize against “will die prematurely of preventable causes” [ 57 ] . In the AEMP , we endeavor for our technological projects to avoid such a premature death through ongoing participatory engagement and sustained relations with tenants and communities who are bearing the brunt of racial capitalism . At the same time , we are careful not to reduce those bearing the brunt of housing injustice to victims of racial capitalism alone as doing so perpetuates damage - based scholarship [ 170 ] . In our collective futuring eforts that involve technology , we note the importance of patiently and gradually building solidarity by working toward shared sets of justice - based agreements , frames for evaluating infrastructure , methods for community ownership , and priorities of language justice and accessibility . In the AEMP , this means working toward a vision that Jack Gieseking deems “good enough” ( democratic , accessible , and useful “enough” ) GIS software [ 55 ] —sustainable , free , and open - source archival digital in - frastructure that can preserve place - based oral histories to support multi - generational interactions [ 47 , 68 , 152 , 182 ] . Yet , as Luis Felipe Murillo has refected upon , free and open - source alternatives are no panacea given the distribution of expertise that they require and the inaccessibility that they pose to many engaged in community organizing for justice [ 121 ] . Community - based software must then be widely accessible and operable for community members who are not technologists . It must also avoid Silicon Valley’s techno - cultures of meritocracy , perfection [ 123 ] , and individualistic temporalities [ 174 ] that are antithetical to shared ownership and collective action . With the AEMP Covid - 19 Housing Story Map as an example of how low - resourced grassroots organizations can create and oper - ate amid competing temporalities , we see that the technology that comprises it is a precarious patchwork of unsustainable corporate software dependencies reliant upon volunteer - based maintenance . These proprietary platforms not only misalign with organizing values and concerns for data privacy , but also limit abilities to sus - tainably archive and input community control into coding processes . We thus see further opportunity for reimagining existing models of digital infrastructure that not only have aforementioned attributes ( e . g . , accessibility ) , but that also operate under community leader - ship , meaning that , in Sasha Costanza - Chock’s words , designers “come to the table” to build upon what technologies communities are already working with , rather than “ [ build ] a new table” altogether [ 24 ] . In this community - led orientation met with extended listening and empathizing well beyond what “design thinking” rubricate as a feeting phase , solidarity may gradually be built to reestablish the rocky foundations of digital infrastructures . Such eforts may lay 2483 DIS ’23 , July 10 – 14 , 2023 , Pitsburgh , PA , USA Halperin & McElroy groundwork to collectively “build a new house”—that is , one situ - ated beyond confnes of capitalism and fattened representations of people and places , as Olufemi Taiwo implores ; his intervention here ofers insight regarding the importance of refusing capitalist imperatives as they seep into the representational politics in the design world , capturing time , data , and home in the process [ 164 ] . To build toward futures of community justice , designers must look beyond capitalist temporalities that are systemically violent [ 38 , 54 ] . In reimagining temporal registers with anti - colonial [ 36 , 99 ] , anti - oppressive [ 19 , 104 ] , politically - expressive [ 31 ] , and social justice - oriented [ 32 , 42 , 43 ] frames , community - based designers can challenge rather than reify the status quo with grassroots technolo - gies [ 52 ] that may upend—not ft into—today’s worlds of injustices [ 87 ] . With extended commitments to community members and lead - ers , designers rooted in fghts against systemic injustices may veer technological trajectories toward meaningful change over time . 6 CONCLUSION Following our three - year long digital story mapping engagement to support housing organizing with the Anti - Eviction Mapping Project , this paper narrates an ethnographic refection to theorize time and technology used in our community - based design process . We encounter three interlocked temporal genres in contexts of hous - ing precarity : slow design with care ; rapid design in response to urgent crises ; and disruptive design ( “move fast and break things” ) that seeps in from Silicon Valley . By foregrounding temporal ten - sions undergirding the crafting of our Covid - 19 Housing Story Map , we assess our data , pacing , storytelling , and tooling of an evolving datafed conjuncture requisite of visualizing and re - visualizing tem - poral eviction , housing policy , oral history , and resistance data . We highlight struggles over pace of practice to balance rapid response amid housing crises with the pace of building community and trust , while examining the time - based media lifecycle of oral stories along - side digital production and preservation perils . We also analyze tooling trade - ofs that occurred throughout our project , which re - quired negotiating our values and needs for expediency . Adding to ongoing conversations regarding the tensions and challenges faced in community - based design , this paper presents temporal elements and entanglements often understudied and overlooked in literatures . To this end , we share ways that community - based de - signers can mindfully design with temporal presence , make the past present through digital storytelling , and reimagine technological relations to reorient power structures over time .
