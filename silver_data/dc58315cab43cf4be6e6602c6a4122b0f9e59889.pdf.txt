In spite of the rapid development of novel transfection materials and methods , the influence of morphology - dependent nanomechanics of malignant osteosarcoma on gene transfection is still unsettled . In this study , cell spreading and adhesion area was adjusted by the prepared micropatterns to regulate focal adhesion ( FA ) formation and cytoskeletal organization in osteosarcoma cells .

Introduction Gene transfection , which introduces exogenous genes into the targeted cells for gene therapy and cancer treatment , has attracted considerable attention due to the potential applications in gene knockout or overexpression , protein decoration , and cell “old - to - young” reprogramming [ 1 – 3 ] . It has also become the significantly advantageous approach to produce the tailor - made genomes and func - tional proteins [ 4 ] . In past almost 40 years , various trans - fection technologies have been well expanded to enhance transfection efficiency , mainly including viral - mediated and nonviral - mediated methods [ 5 – 9 ] . Normally , viral - mediated method is a powerful technique to operate durable transfection because of the straightforward com - bination between viruses and genomes [ 10 ] . However , viral vectors may cause the non - specific inflammatory reaction in vivo and even trigger tumor incidence [ 11 , 12 ] . To cir - cumnavigate these problems , nonviral - mediated methods including physical and chemical ones are able to overcome Open Access Journal of Nanobiotechnology † Yongtao Wang and Nana Wang contributed equally to this work * Correspondence : yongtao _ wang @ shu . edu . cn ; yzchenbio @ zzu . edu . cn ; zzg7181 @ 126 . com 1 Department of Urology , The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University , Zhengzhou University , Zhengzhou 450052 , China 2 School of Medicine , Shanghai University , Shanghai 200444 , China 5 Medical 3D Printing Center , The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University , Zhengzhou University , Zhengzhou 450052 , China Full list of author information is available at the end of the article Page 2 of 13 Wang et al . Journal of Nanobiotechnology ( 2022 ) 20 : 499 these problems and present some advantages , such as operational simplicity , size - free gene package , and rela - tive biosafety [ 13 , 14 ] . For example , physical methods of microinjection , electropotation and sonoporation have been proposed to achieve the targeting gene delivery for efficient transfection [ 15 – 18 ] . Whereas , these strategies need expensive and complex equipments , and also destroy the integrity of host cells , thus leading to low cell viability [ 19 ] . Chemical methods including cationic liposomes , cati - onic polymers and cationic compounds are widely used to evaluate cellular uptake and trafficking of exogenous nanoparticles based on the interaction of cell membrane and electric charges [ 20 – 24 ] . Nevertheless , chemical tech - nologies usually cause low gene transfection efficiency and confine cell lines . Besides efficient gene carrier materials and transfec - tion techniques , cell nanomechanics is also considered as the important factor to allow exogenous genes to pass through cell membrane and be successfully expressed in cells [ 25 , 26 ] . Cellular microenvironment can induce cellular nanomechanics and regulate transfection of exogenous genes , including substrate chemistry , matrix stiffness , viscosity and cell topography [ 27 – 30 ] . These biophysical cues will arrange focal adhesion formation and cytoskeletal structures to alter cellular nanomechan - ics [ 31 ] . Plenty of studies have been reported that cellu - lar morphology mediates cytoskeletal nanomechanics and cell activity to affect cell behaviors , such as spread - ing and adhesion , division and differentiated fate , migra - tion and endocytosis [ 32 – 36 ] . Although internalization of exogenous nanoparticles has been investigated on various micro / nano - patterned surfaces , the influence of micropattern - dependent nanomechanics of malig - nant tumors on gene transfection is not clear and uptake mechanism of exogenous genes is extremely desired to be explained . Osteosarcoma is a highly malignant tumor originating from mesenchymal cells [ 37 ] . Cancerous mesenchymal cells in bone can rapidly expand to build tumor osteoid tissue and cause the death of human beings , especially children and adolescents [ 38 , 39 ] . Until now , in addi - tion to traditional treatments of surgery , chemother - apy and targeted drugs , gene - related therapy has been regarded as the most effective strategy to outstandingly cure malignant osteosarcoma in clinical applications [ 40 , 41 ] . However , due to the existing fact in the differ - ence of metabolism and metastasis in various microenvi - ronments , the enhancement of transfection efficiency in malignant osteosarcoma still maintains a great challenge . In this work , the morphology of osteosarcoma was con - trolled by micropatterns and then transfected by lipid / plasmid lipoplexes to elucidate the influence of micropat - tern - dependent nanomechanics in tumor cells on gene transfection . This study will pave a bright way to under - stand the interaction between tumor nanomechanics and gene transfection . Results and discussion Characterization of mask and micropatterns The topological morphology of osteosarcoma was con - trolled by photolithography - induced micropatterns and then transfected by lipid / plasmid lipoplexes to elucidate the influence of micropattern - dependent nanomechan - ics on gene transfection in osteosarcoma cells . The pho - toreactive PVA ( positive photoresist ) is served as the protein - resistant biomolecules against cell adhesion [ 31 ] . The photoreactive PVA was homogenously overlaid to establish the nanoscale thin layer on TCPS and conse - quently micropatterned by the designed mask ( Fig . 1a ) . The designed mask contained series of microcircles with different sizes ( Fig . 1b ) . In specific , the diameters of the circles were defined to be 30 , 40 , 60 and 80 μm , and the corresponding spreading areas were calculated to be 706 , 1256 , 2826 and 5024 μm 2 . During the process of photo - lithography , short - wave UV light of 254 nm could pass through the transparent regions of the mask to crosslink the photoreactive PVA , yet not irradiate the dark regions of microcircles under the mask . The micropatterns were emerged by removing the uncrosslinked PVA of regions to manifest the exposed TCPS microcircles . The con - firmation of micropatterns was observed by fluorescent microscope ( Fig . 1c ) . The results demonstrated that the micropatterns were successfully transferred from the designed mask to the TCPS plates by photolithography . Furthermore , the images of micropatterns were analyzed by ImageJ software . There were different gray values in both patterned and non - patterned regions to distinguish the integrity of micropatterns . The gray values displayed the similar results in all patterned regions and indicated the uniformity of micropatterns . In addition , the diame - ters and spreading area were also measured based on the images of micropatterns and showed the same characters with designed ones ( Additional file 1 : Table S1 ) . There - fore , the micropatterns could be controlled well through the synthesized PVA by photolithography . Cell micropatterning and FA formation MG63 cells were micropatterned on TCPS templates and the formation of focal adhesions was evaluated by vinculin staining . After MG63 cells were cultured on the micropatterned plates for 24 h , cell morphol - ogy was observed by an optical microscope ( Fig . 2a ) . The cells were particularly attached onto the micropat - terned areas , nevertheless , yet not to PVA - coated areas . The cell spreading area showed similar results with the designed area of micropatterns with 706 , 1256 and 2826 Page 3 of 13 Wang et al . Journal of Nanobiotechnology ( 2022 ) 20 : 499 μm 2 , while the cells could not spread their areas on the whole micropatterns with 5024 μm 2 ( Additional file 1 : Table S2 ) . The results indicated that cells could well accommodate to small micropatterns ( 706 , 1256 and 2826 μm 2 ) , instead of large micropatterns ( 5024 μm 2 ) . It has been reported that oversize microcircles cannot well control cell morphology due to the limitation of inherent MG63 cell spreading area [ 31 ] . In addition , MG63 cells were also cultured on traditionally un - patterned TCPS surface as the control group . The cells of control group developed the spindle - shaped morphology on non - pat - terned surface . Various cell morphologies can guide the formation and alignment of cellular attachment proteins [ 42 ] . Focal adhesion ( FA ) complexes that are tightly connected with cytoskeleton structures , act as the mechanosensor and transmitter during signal transduction [ 43 ] . FA kinase in FA sites is a fundamental ingredient of the signal delivery molecule within proximal cell membrane to administer extensive cell behaviors , including cell survival , spread - ing , division , differentiated fate , migration and endo - cytosis [ 44 – 46 ] . FA Kinase automatically maintains the dormant condition in mammalian cells , however , some biophysical cues from upstream microenvironment ena - bles to recruit the activated kinase into FA complexes to adapt to external changes [ 47 ] . Vinculin , serving as a cru - cial component of FA complexes , can regulate cell adhe - sion functions [ 48 ] . Therefore , the formation of vinculin was investigated with immune - fluorescence staining in different micropatterned cells ( Fig . 2b ) . The stain - ing results presented that vinculin could be assembled in the whole cells , regardless of cell spreading area . Further , vinculin area of MG63 cells was calculated by the step - by - step approach ( Fig . 2c ) . Vinculin area increased obvi - ously with increasing cell spreading area from 706 , 1256 and 2826 to 5024 μm 2 . Particularly , the cells with spread - ing area of 5024 μm 2 formed twice vinculin area than that of 706 μm 2 . The vinculin area of non - patterned cells was calculated to be approximately 448 μm 2 , demonstrating the similar results with the 5024 μm 2 cells . Some studies have reported that FA as the mechanotransductor will portray the signal bridge between integrin linkage and cytoskeleton structures [ 43 ] . The diverse signals derived from various FA structures have been confirmed and can affect cell spreading in malignant tumors [ 49 ] . The rela - tionship was illustrated to reveal the interaction between FA and integrin , RGD or cytoskeleton ( Fig . 2d ) . Focal adhesion sensed microenvironmental stimuli from the micropatterns and transferred these biophysical signals into the cytoskeleton and even the nuclei to command cellular behaviors , such as cellular internalization . FA‑induced cytoskeleton to determine cellular nanomechanics in micropatterned cells FA - induced cytoskeleton distribution and nanomechan - ics were analyzed by AFM nanoindentation . Microenvi - ronmental cues are converted into intracellular signals by mechanosensing FA to induce the formation and align - ment of cytoskeleton [ 50 ] . Actin is one of the basal com - ponents of cytoskeletal structures to support whole cell body [ 43 ] . Therefore , interconnected actin can produce intracellular nanomechanics due to convertible con - tractility to guide cell functions [ 51 ] . In this study , actin filaments were stained green in micropatterned cells ( Fig . 3a ) . Cells assembled their actin filaments along the limited micropatterns in 706 , 1256 and 2826 μm 2 cells , while 5024 μm 2 micropattern wasn’t filled with actin Fig . 1 Preparation and characterization of designed mask and obtained micropatterns . a Schematic illustration of micropattern preparation through positive photoresist PVA on TCPS plates . b Representative images of designed mask with various microcircles . The diameters were designed as 30 , 40 , 60 and 80 μm and the corresponding spreading areas were 706 , 1256 , 2826 and 5024 μm 2 . Scale bar : 100 μm . c Representative images of prepared micropatterns captured by a fluorescence microscope for upper row . Scale bar : 100 μm . The bottom was the gray value of micropatterns calculated from the fluorescent images Page 4 of 13 Wang et al . Journal of Nanobiotechnology ( 2022 ) 20 : 499 filaments . The cells on non - patterned surfaces formed the spindle - shaped network structures . Moreover , actin fila - ments developed fiber - like structures in 2826 , 5024 μm 2 cells and non - patterned cells , but disappeared in small cells ( 706 and 1256 μm 2 ) . As previously reported , stress fibers probably originate from radial fibers and trans - verse arcs by the interaction of cell - substrate interfaces . These emerging stress fibers may determine intercellular nanomechanics ( Fig . 3b ) . To certify this hypothesis , an AFM nanoindentation method was applied to measure the indentation curves of force and distance to evaluate cellular nanomechanics ( Fig . 3c ) . Further , cellular stiff - ness was analyzed by calculating the cellular stiffness of micropatterned and non - patterned cells ( Fig . 3d ) . Young’s modulus presented gradually increasing ten - dency with enlarging cell spreading area , which was associated with the formation of stress fibers in well - spread cells . Therefore , the reorganization of cytoskeletal structures in micropatterned cells could affect cellular nanomechanics and implement the dynamic tension for internalization of exogenous genes , generating high gene transfection efficiency . Influence of micropattern‑dependent nanomechanics on gene transfection of MG63 cells Some stimuli , including biochemical stimuli ( ECM , O 2 , growth factors and functional proteins ) and biophysical stimuli ( viscosity , stiffness , degradation and morphology ) are important factors to govern gene transfection [ 52 – 54 ] . Therefore , the influence of micropattern - dependent nanomechanics of MG63 cells on gene transfection was disclosed on different microcircles . After gene transfec - tion experiment was executed , the lipoplexes were inter - nalized into cells by endocytosis and the plasmid would escape from the liposomes or lysosomes into nucleus for transcription and translation of GFP genes ( Fig . 4a ) .

Focal adhesion sensed microenvironmental stimuli from the micropatterns and transferred these biophysical signals into the cytoskeleton and even the nuclei to command cellular behaviors Page 5 of 13 Wang et al . Journal of Nanobiotechnology ( 2022 ) 20 : 499 The transfected MG63 cells expressing GFP proteins on the micropatterns were captured by a fluorescent micro - scope ( Fig . 4b ) . Transfection efficiency was further cal - culated by analyzing the amount of GFP - positive cells in all checked cells ( Fig . 4 ( c ) . Transfection results indicated that the percentage of GFP - positive cells was enhanced with enlarging MG63 cell adhesion area . The 706 μm 2 cells showed the lowest transfection percentage ( 50 . 9 % ) . Intriguingly , the 5024 μm 2 cells and non - patterned cells showed similar transfection efficiency due to the con - sistency of cell adhesion area . The convergent results are confirmed to present the highest transfection efficiency in largest cell adhesion area of micropatterned hMSCs [ 55 ] . In addition , the micropatterns with larger size and aspect ratio enable to promote cell uptake capacity of gold nanoparticles [ 33 ] . Microscale pitted surfaces of 1 – 6 µm are also applied to disclose transfection mecha - nism of fibroblasts [ 56 ] . In addition of microscale patterns , nanoscale pat - terns and their composites are also prepared to regulate the effect of these aspects on gene transfec - tion [ 57 , 58 ] . Nanoscale grooves can induce different transfection efficiency of human lung fibroblasts by changing the width and height of nanogrooves [ 59 ] .

Journal of Nanobiotechnology ( 2022 ) 20 : 499 A combination of micropillars ( 2 μm ) and nanopillars ( 200 nm ) is applied to adjust cellular topography , and this hierarchical structure will affect cellular internali - zation of dextran in hMSCs and COS7 cell lines [ 58 ] . Furthermore , biofunctional proteins are coated in the vertical arrangement of nanopillars to reveal their influences on transfection [ 29 ] . Exogenous genes are trapped into hollow nanotubes for efficient gene trans - fection . Therefore , these results may indicate that the alternation of geometric topography enables to deter - mine gene transfection . Cytoskeletal nanomechanics to monitor cellular uptake capacity of FITC‑SiO 2 nanoparticles As the first step of gene transfection , successful trans - membrane delivery plays the decisive role in achieving highly efficient transfection [ 60 ] . Indeed , cell plasma membrane , as the natural semipermeable membrane can manipulate selective access to exogenous particles and deliver them into cells [ 61 ] . The internalization of nanoparticles ( NPs ) was explored by FITC - labeled NPs to declare cellular uptake capacity in micropatterned cells .

Journal of Nanobiotechnology ( 2022 ) 20 : 499 The fluorescent images indicated that the amount of NPs increased with increasing cell adhesion area ( Fig . 5a ) . Further , cellular uptake capacity was evaluated by the flu - orescent intensity of FITC - labeled NPs in cells ( Fig . 5b ) . The FITC - labeled intensity was improved with increasing cell adhesion area . The intensity of non - patterned cells showed similar results with 5024 μm 2 cells . Cytoskel - eton plays a decisive role in affecting cellular internaliza - tion capacity , which is associated with clathrin - mediated endocytosis [ 62 ] . As mentioned above , the reorganiza - tion of cytoskeleton in micropatterned cells could induce strong cell nanomechanics to stimulate high cell uptake capacity . Regulation of nuclear Ki67 activity and mechanotransduction by cytoskeletal nanomechanics Nuclear Ki67 activity and mechanotransduction by cytoskeletal nanomechanics were regulated in micropat - terned cells . Cytoskeleton - induced cell mechanics will affect cellular stemness and nuclear DNA synthesis on different substrates [ 32 ] . It has been reported that cell - morphology - dependent cytoskeleton can play a crucial aspect in regulating cellular behaviors , including cell adhesion , spreading , division , migration and uptake [ 30 , 33 ] . Moreover , cell proliferation can enhance transfection of exogenous genes due to the disappearance of nuclear envelope during division process [ 63 ] . Exogenous genes are accessibly delivered into nuclei to participate in the procedures of the DNA synthesis , transcription and translation [ 64 ] . In this study , Ki67 staining was used to explore the influence of cytoskeletal nanomechanics on transfection efficiency . The staining results exhibited that Ki67 preferred to nuclear expression in larger cells , while nuclear Ki67 marker disappeared in 706 and 1256 μm 2 cells ( Fig . 6a ) . Furthermore , cell proliferation ability was analyzed by calculating the amount of Ki67 - positive cells ( Fig . 6b ) . The results disclosed that the percentage of Ki67 - positive cells was enhanced with adjusting MG63 cell adhesion area from 706 to 5024 μm 2 . The cells on non - patterned surfaces presented the highest percent - age of Ki67 - positive cells because of the large adhesion area . The results disclosed that micropattern - induced cell mechanics could promote cellular proliferation ability on large micropatterns , which was beneficial for efficient gene transfection . The reorganization of cytoskeleton is also converted to biochemical and bioelectrical signals in cytoplasm and subsequently transmitted into nuclei to affect cell func - tions [ 65 ] . Current studies have manifested that biome - chanical signals regulate the highly positive expression of mechanics - related genes by altering cellular topography [ 31 , 66 ] . Yes - associated protein ( YAP ) as the downstream of Hippo pathway plays the crucial role in controlling cell behaviors of tension - related genes [ 51 ] . Therefore , YAP and nuclei were co - stained to reveal the influence of cell adhesion area on cellular mechanotransduction ( Fig . 6c ) . Because of the cytoskeletal difference induced by micropatterns , the expression of YAP gene showed dif - ferent activity in micropatterned cells . Perceptibly , YAP was localized in nuclear regions when the cells had large adhesion areas , while YAP of small cells would disperse into cytoplasm . Further , the percentage of YAP nuclear localization was analyzed by calculating the amount of nuclear YAP - positive cells ( Fig . 6d ) .

Journal of Nanobiotechnology ( 2022 ) 20 : 499 localization was enhanced with changing the adhesion area of MG63 cells , which showed the similar results with gene transfection . Therefore , cell morphology was con - trolled by micropatterns to investigate whether micropat - tern - controlled cell nanomechanics could affect gene transfection . Gene transfection showed a gradually rising tendency with enlarging cell adhesion area and nanome - chanics on micropatterns . The transfection results were associated with the formation of focal adhesion , cellular uptake capacity , nuclear Ki67 activity and YAP mecha - notransduction by the regulation of cytoskeleton - related nanomechanics ( Fig . 6e ) . Conclusion The topographical morphology of malignant MG63 cells was controlled by designed micropatterns through pho - tolithography to induce different FAs and cytoskeletal structures . Cellular nanomechanics could be affected by the formation of micropattern - induced FAs and cytoskel - eton structures . The micropatterned cells were trans - fected by lipid / plasmid lipoplexes to investigate their influence on gene transfection . Transfection results showed that the percentage of GFP - positive cells was notably enhanced with enlarging cell adhesion area , which could be explained by FA formation , cytoskeletal nanomechanics , high cell uptake capacity , cell division ability and YAP mechanotransduction . The results will make a deep understanding for the development of gene transfection in gene therapy and cancer treatment . Methods Mask design and micropattern preparation The circle geometry was micropatterned onto the tis - sue culture polystyrene ( TCPS ) plates through pho - toreactive poly ( vinyl alcohol ) ( PVA ) by traditional photolithography method . The mask contained the dark circle micropatterns . The diameter of microcircles was designed to be 30 , 40 , 60 and 80 μm and the correspond - ing spreading areas were 706 , 1256 , 2826 and 5024 μm 2 , respectively . Photoreactive PVA ( PhPVA ) was synthe - sized by the Steglich reaction , as previously reported [ 33 ] . Then , PhPVA aqueous solution with a concentration of 0 . 3 mg mL − 1 was dropped on TCPS plates to form a PhPVA thin layer in the dark . The mentioned - above mask was covered on the PhPVA - coated TCPS surfaces . After UV irradiation and washing in water bath , the micropat - terns were successfully transferred from the pre - designed mask to the PhPVA - coated TCPS plates . The mask was observed by using an optical microscope . The images of micropatterned cells were taken by using a fluorescent microscope and further characterized to analyze the integrity of micropatterns by an ImageJ software . Cell culture Human osteosarcoma cell line ( MG63 cells ) were pur - chased from Chinese Procell Lifer Science & Technol - ogy Co . , Ltd . and subcultured in DMEM medium ( Xi’an Mishu Biotechnology Co . , Ltd . , China ) at 37 ℃ in a 5 % CO 2 incubator . The medium was supplied with 10 % FBS ( Sigma - Aldrich Co . LLC . , USA ) and 1 % penicillin - streptomycin ( Xi’an Mishu Biotechnology Co . , Ltd . ) . Then , the MG63 cells were harvested from a 25 cm 2 cell culture flask and diluted to form the cell suspension with 3 × 10 4 cells / mL in cell density . Cell seeding experi - ment was carried out according to previous reports [ 30 ] . Before MG63 seeding on the micropatterns , the etha - nol - sterilized TCPS plates were placed into the 6 - well culture dishes and covered with a 1 . 5 × 1 . 5 cm 2 PDMS frame with 0 . 1 mm thickness ( Hangzhou Bald Advanced Materials Technology Co . , Ltd . , China ) to avoid cell leak - ing in MG63 seeding . A 200 μL aliquot of cell suspension solution ( 6000 cells ) was seeded into each PDMS frame . MG63 cells were cultured at 37 °C in a 5 % CO 2 incubator for 24 h to maintain the complete occupation of MG63 cells on micropatterns . An optical microscope was used to observe the morphology of MG63 cells on micropat - terns . All experiments of cell culture were implemented in super - clean bench and the used tools were sterilized in an autoclave machine . Plasmid treatment The plasmid ( pAcGFP1 - C1 , Clontech Laboratories , Co . LLC . , USA ) expressed green fluorescent proteins ( GFPs ) in eukaryotic cells . The commercial plasmid was prolif - erated in Escherichia coli to obtain batch plasmid prod - uct , as previously reported [ 36 ] . Then , the purification of proliferated plasmid was executed by American Qiagen Plasmid Mini Kit based on the company’s manners . The treated plasmid was analyzed by Nanodrop spectropho - tometry to measure the concentration ( Thermo Fisher Co . LLC . , USA ) . Immunofluorescence staining of focal adhesion After MG63 cells were incubated on micropatterned plates for 1 day , the samples were treated by 4 % para - formaldehyde ( Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical Technol - ogy Co . , Ltd . , China ) and 1 % Triton X - 100 ( Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co . , Ltd . , China ) for 10 min , handled with 0 . 02 % Tween - 20 for 30 min and blocked with 2 % BSA ( Sigma - Aldrich Co . LLC . , USA ) for 30 min . 1 % Mouse anti - vinculin primary antibody ( Merck KGaA , Germany ) was used to incubate the micropatterned cells overnight . After that , the cells were stained with 1‰ Alexa Fluor 488 - labeled anti - mouse sec - ondary antibody for 1 h . Nucleus was stained with 1‰ Page 10 of 13 Wang et al . Journal of Nanobiotechnology ( 2022 ) 20 : 499 DAPI in the dark for 10 min . The fluorescent images were observed by fluorescence microscope . Vinculin area of MG63 cells was calculated by using the ImageJ software to evaluate the formation of FA through a step - by - step method . Five independent experiments were applied to analyze the mean and SD . Cytoskeleton staining and stiffness measurement After incubation for 1 day , the micropatterned MG63 cells were treated by 4 % paraformaldehyde and 1 % Tri - ton X - 100 , blocked with 2 % BSA . After 3 PBS washes , nucleus and actin bundles were co - stained with 1‰ DAPI and Alexa Fluor - 488 phalloidin in the dark , respec - tively . The staining cells were observed by a fluores - cence microscope . Furthermore , the living MG63 cells were measured by a silicon nitride cantilever fixed on an atomic force microscope ( AFM ) to obtain the curves of force and distance . Young’s modulus was calculated by the curves based on Hertz model method [ 31 ] . All cells were evaluated less than 2 h to keep cell living ability . Ten MG63 cells were applied to analyze the mean and SD . Transfection of MG63 cells Transfection was executed by Lipofectamine 2000 ( Lipo2000 ) ( Invitrogen , USA ) . In specific , 1 μL Lipo2000 and 500 ng pAcGFP1 - C1 were dissolved in 100 μL Opti - MEM ( Life Technologies , USA ) , respectively . After 5 min incubation , the plasmid solution was added into Lipo2000 solution to prepare the cationic Lipo2000 / plasmid lipoplexes . The cationic lipoplexes were further cultured for 30 min to maintain the stable structures . After MG63 cells were incubated on the micropatterns for 1 day , the DMEM was replaced by Opti - MEM for 2 h . Then , 200 μL cationic Lipo2000 / plasmid lipoplexes was used to replace the Opti - MEM . The micropatterned cells were transfected in a 5 % CO 2 incubator for 6 h . Finally , Transfection solution was replaced by DMEM and the cells were further cultured for 18 h to express the GFP proteins . After gene transfection , the samples were treated by 4 % paraformaldehyde . The fixed cells were handled with 1 % Triton X - 100 and blocked with 2 % BSA . The nucleus and actin filaments of transfected cells were co - stained with 1‰ DAPI ( Shandong Sparkjade Scientific Instruments Co . , Ltd . ) and Alexa Fluor - 594 phalloidin ( Invitrogen , USA ) , respectively . MG63 cells were observed by fluorescent microscope to determine whether they were transfected to GFP - positive cells . The fluorescent images were taken and further evaluated by the ImageJ to calculate gene transfer efficiency , as previ - ously reported [ 36 ] . Five independent assays were used to analyze the mean and SD . Cell uptake of nanoparticles Cell uptake capacity was analyzed by FITC - labeled SiO 2 nanoparticles with a radius of 200 nm ( Xi’an ruixi bio - logical Technology Co . , Ltd . , China ) . First , Lipo2000 and nanoparticles solution were dissolved in Opti - MEM , respectively . After 5 min culture , the cationic Lipo2000 / nanoparticle complexes were prepared by directly adding the nanopaticles into Lipo2000 solu - tion and further incubated for 30 min . The uptake experiment was performed in the same process with gene transfection . After cellular uptake , the cells were covered with 0 . 4 % trypan blue ( Shanghai Aladdin Bio - chemical Technology Co . , Ltd . ) to quench the extracel - lular fluorescence of nanoparticles , and followed with PBS washing . Then , the MG63 cells were treated with paraformaldehyde and Triton X - 100 , blocked with BSA . After 3 PBS washes , nucleus of micropatterned cells and actin filaments were co - stained with DAPI and Alexa Fluor - 594 phalloidin . Finally , the fluorescent images were recorded by a fluorescence microscope and analyzed by the ImageJ . The equation of CFI = TFI - ( A × AFI ) was used to calculate the correct fluorescence intensity ( CFI ) of micropatterned cells , A was cell area of interest , TFI and AFI were total fluorescent inten - sity of checked cells and average fluorescent intensity ( background ) of the micropatterned surfaces . CFI was defined as cell uptake capacity . 25 cells were measured to analyze the mean and SD . Immunofluorescence staining of Ki67 and YAP Cell proliferation assay and nuclei mechanotransduction were evaluated by Ki67 staining and YAP staining . In brief , after the micropatterned MG63 cells were seeded and cultured for 1 day , the samples were rinsed with PBS and treated with 4 % paraformaldehyde and Triton X - 100 . The cells were blocked with 2 % BSA for 30 min . After 3 PBS washes , both of Ki67 and YAP staining were executed by the incubation with respective antibody , mouse anti - Ki67 primary antibody ( Thermo Scientific CO . LLC . , USA ) for Ki67 staining and mouse anti - YAP primary antibody ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , USA ) for YAP staining at 4 ℃ overnight . After 3 PBS washes , Alexa Fluor - 488 anti - mouse antibody ( 1 : 1000 in PBS ) was used as second antibody to stain the micropatterned cells . Additionally , nucleus and actin bundles were co - stained with DAPI and Alexa Fluor - 594 phalloidin in the dark . The fluorescent images were captured by a fluorescence microscope . The percentages of divisive cells and YAP nuclei localization were analyzed by calculating the ratios of Ki67 - positive and YAP - positive cells in all checked Page 11 of 13 Wang et al . Journal of Nanobiotechnology ( 2022 ) 20 : 499 cells . Five independent assays were used to analyze the mean and SD . Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was evaluated to calculate signifi - cant difference . The quantitative and fluorescent results were averaged to exhibit the mean ± SD . Significant difference was calculated by using one - way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) . The significant difference was con - sidered when p < 0 . 05 .
