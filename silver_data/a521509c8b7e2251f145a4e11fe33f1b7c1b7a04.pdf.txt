Endocytosis via caveolae : alternative pathway with distinct cellular compartments to avoid lysosomal degradation ? Anna L . Kiss * , Erzsébet Botos Department of Human Morphology and Developmental Biology , Semmelweis University , Budapest , Hungary Received : October 31 , 2008 ; Accepted : March 5 , 2009 Abstract Endocytosis – the uptake of extracellular ligands , soluble molecules , protein and lipids from the extracellular surface – is a vital process , comprising multiple mechanisms , including phagocytosis , macropinocytosis , clathrin - dependent and clathrin - independent uptake such as caveolae - mediated and non - caveolar raft - dependent endocytosis . The best - studied endocytotic pathway for internalizing both bulk membrane and specific proteins is the clathrin - mediated endocytosis . Although many papers were published about the caveolar endo - cytosis , it is still not known whether it represents an alternative pathway with distinct cellular compartments to avoid lysosomal degra - dation or ligands taken up by caveolae can also be targeted to late endosomes / lysosomes . In this paper , we summarize data available about caveolar endocytosis . We are especially focussing on the intracellular route of caveolae and providing data supporting that cave - olar endocytosis can join to the classical endocytotic pathway .

These characteristic membrane invaginations are abundantly present in many but not all eukaryotic cell membrane [ 2 ] . Biochemical studies revealed that caveolae are detergent resistant , highly hydrophobic membrane domains composed of mainly cholesterol and sphingolipids . These detergent - resistant liquid - ordered membrane domains are currently referred to lipid rafts [ 3 – 6 ] . The main structural proteins of caveolae are members of the caveolin gene family , caveolin - 1 , caveolin - 2 and caveolin - 3 . Morphologically defined caveolae can be formed by the expression of caveolin - 1 , which is a small integral membrane protein , whose 34 hydrophobic amino acids inserted into the inner leaflet of the membrane bilayer in a special hairpin - like form and never reaches the outside of the cell . The rest of the protein is cytosolic ; the N - terminal region has a special amino acid sequence functioning as scaffolding domain and has been suggested to be important for binding caveolin to cholesterol and sphingolipid - rich membrane domains [ 7 , 8 ] . This domain is also implicated in binding to sig - nalling molecules [ 2 ] . The C terminus aligns along the inner leaflet of the bilayer by multiple palmitoylations [ 9 ] . Individual caveolae were estimated to contain 144 molecules of caveolin [ 10 ] . Caveolae have been implicated in numerous functions , including cell signalling , lipid regulation , vesicular transport viatheir endo - cytosis , and they have been suggested to play a role in a variety of diseases , including cancer , diabetes and virus infection [ 11 ] . In this paper , we focus on the function of caveolae in endocytosis . Caveolae Review Series J . Cell . Mol . Med . Vol 13 , No 7 , 2009 1229 © 2009 The Authors Journal compilation © 2009 Foundation for Cellular and Molecular Medicine / Blackwell Publishing Ltd Cavolae on the plasma membrane Expression of caveolin - 1 has been described to be necessary and suf - ficient for the formation of morphologically defined caveolae [ 12 , 13 ] . The function of caveolin - 2 has not yet been defined in details ; it was thought to have accessory function in caveolae formation . Recent result suggests that in addition to caveolin - 1 , caveolin - 2 is necessary for formation of deep plasma membrane – attached caveolae [ 14 ] . At the level of endoplasmic reticulum , caveolin - 2 interacts with caveolin - 1 to form high molecular mass hetero - oligomeric complex . The current model of caveolae biogenesis suggests that cavolae form in the Golgi complex by binding these caveolin - 1 / caveolin - 2 het - erooligomers to cholesterol . Interaction of caveolin - 1 with caveolin - 2 renders caveolin - 2 detergent insoluble , and targets Golgi localized caveolin - 2 to the plasma membrane . Exit from the Golgi complex is accelerated by cholesterol [ 15 ] and inhibited by glycosphingolipid depletion [ 16 ] . The small ‘caveolae precursors’ ( also called ‘exocytic caveolar carriers’ [ 17 ] ) are trafficking to the plasma membrane [ 18 ] . When the small caveolar carriers are inserted to the plasma mem - brane , caveolae are becoming relatively immobile structures . Based on ultrastructural studies , it seems likely that caveolae for - mation requires proteins other than caveolins . Recently , PTRF - cavin ( p - cavin ) , a protein initially identified as polimerase I , a transcript release factor was found to be also required for caveolae formation in mammalian and zebrafish cells [ 19 – 22 ] . PTRF - cavin is a soluble cytosolic protein recruited to the membrane to generate caveolae , and it most likely operates as a coat protein for caveolae . Binding of PTRF - cavin to membrane domain containing oligomerized caveolins , cholesterol and phosphatidylserine stabilizes the membrane curva - ture to produce the classical flask shape of cavolae . Biochemical and morphological data [ 21 , 22 ] suggest that p - cavin associates with mature caveolae at the plasma membrane but does not associate with non - caveolar caveolin present in the Golgi complex . Caveolae are anchored to the plasma membrane by cytoskele - tal components [ 23 ] . An actin cross - linking protein , filamin , is one of the proteins identified as a ligand for caveolin - 1 [ 24 ] . However , the molecular mechanism for binding caveolae to the cytoskeleton has not been established . Liu and Pilch [ 22 ] provide experimental data suggesting that PTRF - cavin may serve as direct connection between caveolar components and the cytoskeleton . Cholesterol itself is essential for caveolae formation and caveolin transcription as well [ 5 , 25 ] . Cells treated with agents that remove cholesterol ( filipin , methyl - (cid:2) - cyclodextrin or nystatin ) lose caveolin and caveolae , resulting in flattened plasma membranes [ 26 ] . Internalization of caveolae Are caveolae stable , immobile invaginations at the plasma membrane ? Caveolae and caveolin - containing membrane domains on the plasma membrane have various curvatures and shapes ( (cid:3) , elongated flask , curved membrane invaginations with wide opening and narrow neck ) . This morphology strongly suggests that caveolae could be involved in endocytosis operating parallelly to clathrin - mediated endocytosis . In spite of the morphological evidence , it has been debated for a long time that caveolae can really pinch off from the plasma membrane . Studying the dynamic properties of caveolae by green - fluorescent - protein ( GFP ) - tagged caveolin - 1 fusion protein , it revealed that the exchange of caveolin - 1 - GFP between plasma membrane and intracellular pool is surprisingly slow ; indicating that plasma membrane caveolae are immobile structures [ 27 ] . Uptake of albumin receptor ( gp60 ) localized in caveolae in endothelial cells is inhibited by over - expression of caveolin - 1 [ 28 ] , suggesting that caveolin - 1 itself can be responsible for stabilizing caveolae on the plasma membrane . Increasing number of evidence show , however , that although caveolae are not normally involved in endocytosis , interaction of caveolae or caveolin with specific ligands can trigger the rapid internalization of caveolae . Several ligands like folic acid [ 29 , 30 ] , albumin [ 31 ] , autocrine motility factor [ 32 ] , alkaline phosphatase [ 33 ] , lactosyl ceramide [ 34 ] and pathogens as ganglioside - bound cholera toxin [ 33 ] , SV40 virus [ 2 , 35 ] , polyoma virus [ 36 ] , echovirus1 [ 37 ] , HIV virus [ 38 ] , respiratory syncytial virus [ 39 ] , certain FimH - expressing bacteria [ 40 ] are known to be internalized by caveolae . Binding of various ligands to caveolin / caveolae , cross - linking caveolar components , receptors accumulating in caveolae promote downstream of signalling events resulting in caveolar internalization [ 41 ] . Based on morphological and biochemical data recently , it is generally accepted that caveola - mediated endocytosis functions as a true uptake mechanism parallel to the clathrin - mediated path - way . Being ligand - triggered , caveolar endocytosis provides a highly regulated way for uptake of specified substances . Caveolar budding and pinching off from the plasma membrane Caveolar budding is regulated by kinases and phosphatases . Caveolin was first described as a substrate for Src - family tyrosine kinase [ 42 , 43 ] . Later a special interaction between Src and cave - olin - 1 was found : the scaffolding domain of caveolin - 1 binds Src [ 44 – 46 ] . Palmytoilation of caveolin - 1 at cystein 156 also con - tributes to the coupling of Src to caveolin - 1 [ 44 , 45 ] . Caveolin - 1 was described to be phosphorylated [ 41 ] on tyrosine residue 14 by Src family kinase [ 33 , 43 and 46 ] . Binding of albumin to gp60 , ( receptor for albumin localized in caveolae ) induces tyrosine phosphorylation of both gp60 and caveolin - 1 [ 47 ] . Tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( herbimycid A and genistein ) prevented the gp60 - activated vesicle formation and albumin endocytosis [ 47 ] . These data suggest that caveolin - 1 phosphorylation results in caveolar internalization . Lee et al . [ 48 ] showed that the other caveolin isoform , cave - olin - 2 also undergoes Src - induced phosphorylation on tyrosine 19 . Phosphocaveolin - 2 ( TyrP19 ) was strictly co - localized with phosphocaveolin - 1 ( TyrP14 ) indicating that the simultaneous 1230 © 2009 The Authors Journal compilation © 2009 Foundation for Cellular and Molecular Medicine / Blackwell Publishing Ltd phosphorylation of caveolin - 1 and caveolin - 2 might equally be important in regulation of caveolae pinching off from the plasma membrane . Similarly , phosphorylation of caveolin - 2 – induced internalization of cavolae in peritoneal macrophages [ 49 ] . As expected , phosphatases play an important role in caveolar internalization . Vanadate , a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor stimu - lates caveolar endocytosis by causing hyperphosphorylation of tyrosine residues of caveolin - 1 [ 50 ] . Treatment with a ser - ine / threonine phosphatase inhibitor ( ocadaic acid ) causes mas - sive mobilization of caveolae [ 33 , 34 , 49 – 52 ] . Ocadaic acid is a polyether metabolite , isolated from the black marine sponge Halichondria ocadaiand inhibits protein phosphatases , especially PP1 and PP2A [ 53 ] . PP1 and PP2A are two major classes of ser - ine / threonine protein phosphatases that dephosphorylate a broad spectrum of protein kinases [ 54 ] . The exact mechanism by which serine / threonine phosphatase ( PP1 and PP2A ) inhibitors can stimulate caveolar endocytosis is not known . Because PP2A is a specific inhibitor of Src kinase , one possible explanation for ocadaic acid effect to stimulate caveolar internalization is that these sequential inhibitions activate Src kinase that can phospho - rylate caveolin - 1 and / or - 2 ( Fig . 1 ) . Sowa et al . [ 14 ] mapped two serine phosphorylation sites in the N - terminal region ( 23 , 36 ) of caveolin - 2 . They showed that phos - phorylation of each site contributes to caveolin - 1 - dependent caveo - lae formation . Mutation of serine 36 to alanine markedly reduced the number of plasma membrane – attached caveolae . Phosphorylation of serine 23 had marginal influence on the formation of caveolae on the plasma membrane but enhanced the number of uncoated vesi - cles in the cytoplasm . When both 23 and 36 serine residues were replaced by alanine , the surface - attached caveolae were eliminated but appearance of non - coated vesicles in the cytoplasm was markedly increased . These results suggest that dephosphorylation of serine residues of caveolin - 2 might also be important to regulate caveolae pinching off from the plasma membrane . The GTP - binding protein dynamin is known to play an impor - tant role in pinching off of clathrin - coated vesicles [ 55 ] . It was a surprising finding when dynamin was found to recruit also to caveolar membranes [ 56 , 57 ] . Subsequent to the hydrolysis of GTP , dynamin triggers fission of caveolae by constricting its neck . Dynamin , however , is not a permanent component of caveolae ; association of dynamin with caveolae appears to be a transient phenomenon [ 2 ] . Intersectin - 2 has been reported to localize also at the neck of caveolae controlling caveolar endocytosis by regu - lating the GTP - ase activity of dynamin [ 58 ] . Recently , the endothe - lial NO synthase ( eNOS ) - trafficking inducer , NOSTRIN , was found to function as an adaptor recruiting dynamin - 2 molecules required for vesicle membrane fission [ 59 , 60 ] . The cytoskeleton has also important function in regulating the steady - state distribution of caveolae [ 23 ] . Although the cortical actin cytoskeleton appears to confine caveolae / caveolin - 1 to the cell surface acting as simple physical barriers to the detachment of caveolae , microtubules serve as tracks for the transport of caveo - lae in the cytoplasm . Thus , the internalization of caveolae depends on the integrity and / or reorganization of the cytoskeleton [ 33 ] , and local disassembly of cortical actin network is essential to initiate inward transport of caveolae along microtubules . Reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton was found to be crucial for SV40 virus entry . Accumulation of virus in caveolae initiates a signalling cascade that Fig . 1 The possible mechanism by which ocadaic acid can cause tyrosine phosphoryla - tion of caveolin and results in the internaliza - tion of caveolae . Ocadaic acid is a specific serine / threonine phosphatase ( PP1 and PP2A ) inhibitor . Src kinase is specifically inhibited by PP1 and PP2A . The sequential inhibitions activate Src kinase that can phos - phorylate tyrosine residues of caveolin - 1 and / or - 2 . Dephosphorylation of caveolin sup - posed to be necessary for the recycling of caveolae to the cell surface . J . Cell . Mol . Med . Vol 13 , No 7 , 2009 1231 © 2009 The Authors Journal compilation © 2009 Foundation for Cellular and Molecular Medicine / Blackwell Publishing Ltd leads to tyrosine phosphorylation and depolymerization of cortical actin cytoskeleton . Actin monomers are recruited to the virus - loaded caveolae and actin patches are formed . After internalization of caveolae , the cortical cytoskeleton returns to its normal pattern [ 2 ] . Ocadaic acid can also cause reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton , leading to caveolar internalization [ 27 ] . There are data suggesting that integrins , or rather integrin - mediated adhesion , also regulate the caveolar endocytosis [ 61 , 62 ] . Integrins connect the extracellular matrix to the actin cytoskeleton at special structures called focal adhesions through a protein complex that includes vinculin , pallixin , tallin and (cid:4) - actinin [ 63 ] . Caveolin - 1 – especially its tyrosin - phosphorylated ( pY14cav - 1 ) form – was found to strongly colocalize with vinculin at focal adhesion [ 61 ] . Although caveolin phosphorylation induces internalization , integrins inhibit internalization by retaining phos - pho - caveolin in focal adhesion . Cell detachment triggers a shift in phospho - caveolin localization to caveolae where it induces inter - nalization of this membrane domain [ 61 , 62 ] . Summarizing , phosphorylation of caveolin ( s ) , recruitment and activation of dynamin at the caveolar neck , reorganization of the cytoskeleton are essential for caveola internalization . Once caveolae pinched off from the plasma membrane , they may associate with motor molecules that propel them along the microtubules [ 23 ] . Intracellular route of caveolae Less extensively documented are the trafficking and the intracellu - lar fate of caveolae . Caveolae were shown to be equipped with sev - eral components of fusion machinery [ 64 ] . NSF , SNAP , VAMP were described to concentrate in caveolae and possibly associate with caveolin - 1 [ 65 , 66 ] . Thus , internalized caveolae co - opt the same mechanism used in trafficking of other vesicles [ 65 – 67 ] ; therefore , they can dock and fuse with cytoplasmic organelles [ 33 , 67 ] . The basic question is whether the internalized caveolae can fuse with endosomes and follow the classical endocytotic degradative pathway or the alternative endocytosis involves alter - native cellular compartments . Stimulated caveolar internalization is always accompanied by the appearance of grape - like multi - caveolar complexes ( Fig . 2A ) . Studying the entry of SV40 viruses Fig . 2 ( A ) Stimulated internalization of caveolae results in the appear - ance of caveola - clusters ( stars ) . ( B ) and ( C ) Some of these clusters are in connection with the cell surface through narrow tubular invagi - nation of the plasma membrane . ( C ) Using anti - caveolin - 1 antibody on ultra - thin – frozen sections , these multi - caveolar clusters were always found to be caveolin - positive .

The gold particles repre - sent caveolin - 1 and the diameter of the gold particles is shown in index . ) pm : plasma membrane . Bars : 200 nm . 1232 © 2009 The Authors Journal compilation © 2009 Foundation for Cellular and Molecular Medicine / Blackwell Publishing Ltd taken up by caveolae , the virus particles were detected in these multi - caveolar complexes of neutral pH , distinct from classical endocytotic compartments [ 35 ] . These multi - caveolar complexes never fused with lysosomes ; thus , viruses could escape lysosomal degradation . Since these structures were labelled with caveolin - 1 , they were named caveosomes [ 35 , 68 ] . Until now , only a few elec - tron microscopical pictures were published about the morphology of these organelles [ 35 , 69 ] . According to recent knowledge , caveosomes are multi - caveo - lar structures of heterogeneous morphology ; they are supposed to be early endosome - equivalent intermediate organelles in caveolar endocytosis . The further fate of caveosomes is not entirely known . Viruses were described to be sorted from caveosomes into vesic - ular and tubular structures that travel along microtubules to the smooth endoplasmic reticulum [ 35 , 37 ] . There are data , however , showing that ligands internalized by cavolae can be driven to the classical endocytotic organelles . Cholera toxin entering the cells by caveolar endocytosis passes through early endosomes and accumulates in the Golgi complex [ 70 ] . It was also shown that under normal conditions , caveolae carrying SV40 virus particles can transiently interact with early endosomes [ 71 , 72 ] . The existence of two caveolar trafficking routes involving caveosomes and early endosomes raises the questions whether caveosomes are independent structures or the downstream caveosomes interact with the classical endocytotic compartments . When we studied caveolar internalization in HepG2 cells , we found that many of these caveosome - like multi - caveolar complexes were connected with the cell surface by a narrow tubu - lar plasma membrane invaginations ( Fig . 2B and C ) , but some of them seemed to be independent structures in the cytoplasm . When Ruthenium red ( Ru red ) – an electron dense dye – was used to label the cell surface , many of these structures were Ru red – positive ( Fig . 3A – C ) indicating that they were still connected with the cell surface . These results support the idea that a signifi - cant portion of these multi - caveolar complexes described as caveosomes are not independent structures . The sub - cellular distribution of caveolin could provide insights into the endocytotic pathways . Caveolin - 1 in many cells is evident on the cell surface and within the Golgi complex , and only partial colocalization can be detected with endosomal markers such as EEA1 , a marker of the early sorting endosome [ 71 ] or CD63 , late endosomal marker [ 73 ] . When caveolar endocytosis was pro - voked by albumin , the number of CD63 and caveolin - 1 double - labelled multi - vesicular bodies or late endosomes significantly increased [ 73 ] . Studying the long - term internalization of albumin in HepG2 cells , albumin was found to accumulate in large , cave - olin - 1 - positive caveosome - like caveolar clusters . At the same time , the number of caveolin - 1 and CD63 containing multi - vesic - ular bodies significantly increased ( Fig . 4 ) indicating that caveo - lae - mediated endocytosis of albumin resulted in an increased Fig . 3 Using Ruthenium red ( Ru red ) to label the cell surface , single vesicles ( arrows ) as well as caveolar clusters ( arrowheads ) are found to be Ru red – positive . This finding indicates that they are still in con - nection with the cell surface . Note that many of the vesicles deeper in the cytoplasm are also labelled with Ru red showing that they are still connected with the cell surface . The caveolar clusters ( arrowheads ) are often described as caveosomes . The Ru red staining clearly shows that many of them are not independent structures . pm : plasma membrane . Bars : 400 nm .

Caveolin - 1 and CD63 ( late endosomal marker ) double labelling on ultra - thin – frozen section . Numerous caveolin - 1 and CD63 containing multi - vesicular bodies ( mvb ) are present in the cytoplasm indicating that caveola - mediated endocytosis of albumin resulted in an increased trafficking of caveolae to the classical degradative pathway .

Bars : 200 nm . caveolar trafficking along the classical endosomal degradative pathway [ 73 ] . Analysing the involvement of several small GTPases in the traf - ficking of caveolae , Pelkmans et al . [ 71 ] found that caveolae could move to early endosomes in a Rab5 - dependent manner . Although caveolae dock to and fuse with endosomal membrane , their mem - brane domains do not mix with each other . After some time , the caveolin - 1 sub - domains can pinch off again from early endo - somes as membrane vesicles . If caveolae transiently fuse with early endosomes , one can suppose that they should be able to pick up some fluid from that compartment and potentially carry it to caveosomes , suggesting that the traffic is bidirectional . Experiments using a fluid - phase tracer Lucifer yellow ( LY ) showed that after long - time incubation , small but significant amount of LY accumulated in caveosomes [ 72 ] . Human polyoma virus ( JCV ) that is known to enter the cell by clathrin - dependent endocytosis and transported immediately to early endosomes can also be sorted to a caveolin - 1 - positive endosomal compartment . This transport is also dependent on Rab5 - GTP - ase [ 74 ] . These experi - mental data clearly show that there is communication between caveola - mediated and classical endocytotic pathways and suggest that the communication between caveosomes and early endo - somes is bidirectional . The morphological entities by which this communication can occur are not known . Caveolin - 1 containing sub - domains pinching off from the early endosomes and / or caveosomes as vesicles can function as mediators between the two pathways . Since dynamin was found to accumulate along the surface - connecting tubular part of the caveolar clusters [ 75 ] , it cannot be excluded , however , that caveolar clusters ‘en mass’ can fuse with endosomes . Kinases and phosphatases also have regulatory role in fusion of caveolar carriers with endosomal compartments / or caveo - somes . Sorting , distribution , transfer to final destination of the cargo strongly depend on kinases and phosphatases . Using high - throughput RNA interference and automated image analysis , Pelkmans et al . [ 76 ] showed that a high number ( about 43 ) of kinases are required for caveolar entry of SV40 virus . By this genomewide screen , they could show specific role of kinases at different stages of the caveolar assembly and transport . Large group of these kinases was found to function in various signalling system indicating that endocytotic transport and signal transduc - tion are tightly coupled . Not only phosphorylation but also dephosphorylation of mem - brane - associated receptors or proteins can be critical to determine the sorting . The regulatory role of phosphatases , however , is less known . There are data indicating that PP2A – a serine / threonine phosphatase – plays an important role in endosomal sorting and movement of endocytotic compartments along the microtubules [ 77 – 79 ] . By dephosphorylation of proteins present in the endoso - mal membrane , PP2A can regulate maturation of endosomes , fusion of endosomes with lysosomes [ 78 , 80 , 81 ] . If PP2A is inhibited , the classical endocytotic sorting is blocked and the cargo can stuck in one of the intermediate compartments . The small T - antigen of SV40 virus is known to bind and inhibit PP2A [ 82 ] , by which it can interfere the maturation of virus and cave - olin - containing endosomes ( caveosomes ) and endo - some / lysosome fusion . This might explain why SV40 virus is retained in caveosomes resulting in an escape from lysosomal degradation . Caveolin - 1 itself is known to interact with and inhibit PP2A [ 83 ] that can result in accumulation of caveolae in caveo - somes . It seems likely that the interaction of the cargo with cave - olar components , caveolin itself or any of the regulatory kinases and / or phosphatases can be an important determinant for the final destination of the cargo . 1234 © 2009 The Authors Journal compilation © 2009 Foundation for Cellular and Molecular Medicine / Blackwell Publishing Ltd Fig . 5 Intracellular trafficking of caveolae . Phosphorylation of caveolin ( s ) , associa - tion of dynamin with the neck of caveolae , reorganization of the cytoskeleton result in pinching off of caveolae from the plasma membrane . Stimulated caveola internaliza - tion can result in formation of caveolar clusters as well . Internalized caveolae can fuse with early endosomes ( EE ) in a Rab5 - dependent manner . Pinched - off single caveolae might fuse with pre - existing caveosomes ( C ) or caveolar clusters ‘en mass’ detaching from the plasma mem - brane can form caveosomes . The caveo - some – endosome pathways seem to be bidirectional . Further sorting from early endosomes can occur to recycling endo - somes ( RE ) or multi - vesicular bodies ( MVB ) / lysosomes ( Ly ) . The sorting depends on Rabs and PP2A as well . It has been suggested that cholesterol itself plays an important role in intracellular transport [ 25 ] . Normally , cholesterol is present in the plasma membrane and early endosomes and is sorted away from late endosomes and lysosomes [ 84 ] . Recent studies have revealed that cholesterol is not a passive component of endoso - mal membranes but rather directly involved in the sorting and transport of endocytotic vesicles [ 85 ] . Conclusions Although caveolae are immobile lipid domains of the plasma mem - brane , under special conditions ( like binding - specific ligands to their receptors ) they can pinch off from the plasma membrane . Nowadays , it is generally accepted that caveola - mediated endocytosis functions as a true uptake mechanism parallel to the clathrin - mediated pathway . Being ligand - triggered , caveolar endocytosis provides a more selec - tive and highly regulated way for uptake of specified substances . Caveolar endocytosis is regulated by kinases and phosphatases . Tyrosin phosphorylation of caveolin - 1 ( and maybe caveolin - 2 ) can initiate budding and internalization of caveolae . The GTP - binding pro - tein dynamin that is temporally associated to caveolae triggers fission of caveolae by constricting its neck subsequent to the hydrolysis of GTP . The internalization of caveolae depends on the integrity and / or reorganization of the cytoskeleton : local disassembly of cortical actin network is essential to initiate inward transport of caveolae [ 33 ] . Once caveolae pinch off from the plasma membrane , they may associate with motor molecules that propel them along the microtubules [ 23 ] . Although the cortical actin cytoskeleton appears to confine caveo - lae / caveolin - 1 at the cell surface acting as simple physical barriers to the detachment of caveolae , microtubules serve as tracks for the transport of caveolae in the cytoplasm . After internalization , grape - like multi - caveolar complexes called caveosomes are appearing in the cytoplasm [ 2 , 35 , 68 ] . It is still debated whether these caveolar clusters are independent entities because many of them are connected to the cell surface by very narrow tubular plasma membrane invaginations . Viruses are accumulated in these multi - caveolar complexes of neutral pH , dis - tinct from classical endocytotic compartments [ 35 ] . They never fuse with lysosomes ; thus , viruses can escape lysosomal degra - dation . Other ligands using caveolae to enter the cells , however , are present in early endosomes following the classical endocytotic route . Long - term incubation with albumin also results in the appearance of caveolin - 1 in late endosomes / multi - vesicular bod - ies indicating that caveolae or caveosomes communicate with the classical endocytotic compartments . These data strongly suggest that although the first step of the uptake is different , but the intermediate organelles ( caveosomes / early endosomes ) can J . Cell . Mol . Med .

Endothelial cell - surface gp60 acti - vates vesicle formation and trafficking via communicate with each other ; thus , ligand internalized by caveolae can be driven to the classical endocytotic pathway . The route followed by different ligands is regulated by small GTPases ( Rab molecules ) , kinases and phosphatases . ( Fig . 5 sum - marizes the possible route for caveolae after internalization . ) It seems likely that the interaction of the cargo with caveolar components , caveolin itself or any of the regulatory kinases and phosphatases can have determining influence on the final destination of the cargo . Since numerous signalling molecules were identified to accu - mulate in caveolae , they can also be called ‘signaling organelles’ [ 86 ] . Large group of kinases identified in endocytosis function in various signalling pathways strongly support the idea that endo - cytotic transport and signal transduction are tightly coupled and the caveolar internalization should play an important role to regu - late signal transduction as well . It has to be point out that there are caveolae that are immobile ; they never pinch off from the plasma membrane . Smooth muscle cells have huge amount of caveolae on their plasma membrane by which the surface area is enlarged over 80 % . These caveolae , however , are never taking part in endocytosis , calcium handling seems to be one of the most important role of them [ 87 , 88 ] .
