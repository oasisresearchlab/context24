E - mail : demangel @ pasteur . fr Abstract Inflammation adversely affects the health of millions of people worldwide and there is an unmet medical need for better anti - inflammatory drugs . Here , we evaluated the therapeutic interest of mycolactone , a polyketide - derived macrolide produced by Mycobacterium ulcerans . Bacterial production of mycolactone in human skin causes a combination of ulcerative , analgesic and anti - inflammatory effects . While ulcer formation is mediated by the pro - apoptotic activity of mycolactone on skin cells via hyper - activation of Wiskott - Aldrich Syndrome proteins , analgesia results from neuronal hyper - polarization via signaling through angiotensin II type 2 receptors . Mycolactone also blunts the capacity of immune cells to produce inflammatory mediators , by an independent mechanism of protein synthesis blockade . In an attempt to isolate the structural determinants of mycolactone’s immunosuppressive activity , we screened a library of synthetic subunits of mycolactone for inhibition of cytokine production by activated T cells . The minimal structure retaining immunosuppressive activity was a truncated version of mycolactone , missing one of the two core - branched polyketide chains . This compound inhibited the inflammatory cytokine responses of human primary cells at non - cytotoxic doses , and bound to angiotensin II type 2 receptors comparably to mycolactone in vitro . Notably , it was considerably less toxic than mycolactone in human primary dermal fibroblasts modeling ulcerative activity . In mouse models of human diseases , it conferred systemic protection against chronic skin inflammation and inflammatory pain , with no apparent side effects . In addition to establishing the anti - inflammatory potency of mycolactone in vivo , our study therefore highlights the translational potential of mycolactone core - derived structures as prospective immunosuppressants . INTRODUCTION Whether mycolactone , the major virulence factor of Mycobacterium ulcerans , impacts the systemic generation of inflammatory mediators in infected hosts remains unclear ( 1 - 3 ) . Mycolactone production by bacteria infecting the skin provokes focal lesions called Buruli ulcers ( BU ) that are marked by an association of tissue necrosis , local analgesia and defective inflammation ( 4 ) . We reported previously that mycolactone - driven destruction of cutaneous tissues proceeds through hyper - activation of N - WASP , a protein controlling the junctional organization and coordinated migration of epidermal cells ( 5 ) . Recently , mycolactone was shown to inhibit pain perception by binding to angiotensin II type 2 receptors ( AT 2 Rs ) on neurons , leading to potassium - dependent hyperpolarization ( 6 ) . In addition to a lack of inflammatory infiltrates at the level of skin lesions ( 7 ) , patients with BU display systemic alterations in their cellular immune responses , evidenced by an impaired capacity of T cells to produce cytokines ex - vivo upon stimulation with mitogenic agents ( 8 - 10 ) . Contrary to wild - type strains , mycolactone - deficient mutants of M . ulcerans do not impair the capacity of T cells to produce interleukin ( IL ) - 2 in animal models , showing that mycolactone is the cause of these cellular response defects ( 11 ) . In vitro , nanomolar concentrations of mycolactone efficiently blocked the functional maturation of dendritic cells ( 12 ) and cytokine production by activated lymphocytes , monocytes , macrophages and epithelial cell lines ( 13 - 17 ) . Mycolactone also down - regulated the expression of L - selectin on naive T cells , profoundly impacting on lymphocyte homing and expansion upon antigenic stimulation in vivo ( 18 ) . Although the molecular receptor mediating these effects remains to be identified , there is recent evidence showing that mycolactone operates by an original mechanism of post - transcriptional blockade of protein synthesis , selectively affecting membrane and secreted proteins ( 17 ) . Following release by bacterial infection of the skin , or upon subcutaneous injection , mycolactone diffuses into the peripheral blood and reaches lymphoid organs ( 11 , 19 ) . This diffusion capacity , combined with potent immunosuppressive and analgesic properties , make mycolactone a drug candidate for the treatment of inflammatory disorders . Its development for clinical use nevertheless faces two major challenges . Firstly , the chemical synthesis of this complex natural product is a costly , multi - step process ( 1 , 20 - 22 ) , which challenges bulk industrial production . Secondly , whether mycolactone can be engineered to dissociate immunosuppression and analgesia from cytotoxicity is currently unknown ( 23 - 25 ) . Here we screened a large panel of structural variants of mycolactone in biochemical and cellular assays reflecting its biological activities . We identified a simplified and detoxified version of mycolactone that bound to analgesia - mediating receptors comparably to the natural product , and mimicked its inhibitory action on inflammatory cytokine production . Importantly , this synthetic compound efficiently protected mice against chronic skin inflammation and inflammatory pain , establishing the therapeutic potential of this mycolactone derivative . RESULTS Immune modulating and cytopathic features of mycolactone can be partially dissociated Mycolactone produced by M . ulcerans is composed of three structural modules , a 12 - membered lactone ring and two polyketide - derived chains that are branched to the core in the north and south positions ( Fig . 1 ) . Bacteria produce a mixture of cis / trans isomers designated A / B . To investigate the contribution of each subunit of mycolactone A / B to biological activity , we used synthetic compounds corresponding to the lactone core and fatty - acyl chains assembled in diverse combinations , and harboring variations in the structure and hydroxylation of the polyketide chains ( 20 , 23 ) ( Fig . 1 ) . Variants were compared to mycolactone for their capacity to block the activation - induced production of IL - 2 by Jurkat cells , using IC 50 as a comparator ( Fig . 2A , S1 ) . In this T cell model , mycolactone dose - dependently inhibited the production of IL - 2 upon cell stimulation with phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate ( PMA ) and ionomycin ( IO ) with an IC 50 of 40 nM ( 13 ) . Variants were also assessed for their cytopathic activity in the human epithelial cell line HeLa , a model that is highly susceptible to mycolactone - mediated anoïkis ( 5 ) . Here , we compared variants for their capacity to induce cell detachment after 48 h , conditions in which mycolactone induces > 80 % cytotoxicity ( Fig . 2A , S1 ) . Figure 2B plots the aforementioned parameters of immunomodulation and cytotoxicity of each variant . Notably , all variants were less active than mycolactone , indicating that each structural module of the natural molecule has a biological role ( Fig . 2B , S1 ) . Compared to mycolactone , immunomodulatory activity was best retained in compounds 32b , 30 , 5r and 5b ( IC 50 of 1 . 5 µ M ) , in which the north chain is missing ( 5b , 5r and 30 ) or replaced by a 4 - alkyl - 1 , 2 , 3 - triazole ( 32b ) . Amongst them , saturation of the lactone core ( 30 ) or substitution of the C1’ - C7’ sector of the south chain with a cinnamyl ( 5r ) did not alter activity . Of note , 32b , 30 and 5r were more cytotoxic than 5b , showing that cytotoxicity and immunosuppressive activity can be , at least partially , dissociated . A second group of mycolactone analogues displaying IC 50 in the 2 . 2 - 3 . 4 µ M range encompassed derivatives with inverted and / or deoxy C12 ' , C13 ' and C15 ' stereocenters . In accordance with previous reports ( 24 ) , a significant loss in immunosuppressive and cytotoxic activity was observed when the hydroxyl group in position C12’ was suppressed ( 5j ) . Likewise , modification of the C1’ - C5’ sector of the southern fragment by introduction of a benzoyl motif was also detrimental to activity ( 5q ) . A last group of 9 analogues showed no detectable inhibitory activity in the IL - 2 assay , in tested conditions ( IC 50 ≥ 4 µ M ) . Their lack of reactivity indicated that shortening the polyketide chain and removing more than one out of three hydroxyl groups in the C12’ - C13’ - C15’ sector has dramatic impact on immunosuppressive activity . Intriguingly , variant 4b corresponding to C8 - desmethyl mycolactone A / B fell in this category , suggesting that intra - molecular interactions between the northern chain and lactone core may limit reactivity . Overall , this study showed that the structural requirements for cytotoxic and immunosuppressive activities do not strictly overlap . The 5b variant , corresponding to mycolactone without north chain and core C8 - methyl , displayed an optimal ratio of immune suppression to cytotoxicity , prompting us to examine its biological properties in further detail . 5b suppresses inflammatory responses in human primary cells To gain insight into the translational potential of 5b , we next assessed its impact on the viability and functional biology of key subsets of human inflammatory cells . Polymorphonuclear neutrophils ( PMN ) dominate the early stages of inflammation , and activated PMN sustain inflammatory responses via the production of cytokines like TNF - α ( 26 ) . PMN isolated from venous blood of healthy donors were incubated for up to 24 h with mycolactone or 5b , prior to activation with PMA . Although the viability of PMN declined in culture , we did not observed increased mortality in the presence of mycolactone or 5b , irrespective of the cell activation state ( Fig . S2 ) . Notably , exposure to mycolactone , and 5b to a lower extent , efficiently blocked the ability of PMN to release TNF - α upon activation ( Fig . 3A ) . Production of TNF - α by LPS - stimulated monocyte - derived macrophages ( MDM ) was also potently inhibited by pre - incubation with mycolactone or 5b , without evidence of cell mortality ( Fig . 3B ) . Of note , prolonged exposure ( > 48h ) of MDM to immunomodulatory concentrations of mycolactone or 5b eventually altered cell viability ( Fig . 3C ) . In contrast , the viability of CD4 + T cells was not altered by exposure to mycolactone or 5b for up to 48 h ( Fig . S3 ) . Their PMA / IO - induced production of IL - 2 and interferon ( IFN ) - γ was markedly inhibited by pre - incubation with mycolactone or 5b ( as shown for IL - 2 in Fig . 3D ) . Mycolactone binding to AT 2 R , evidenced by competition with an AT 2 R agonist in vitro , was previously reported to mediate analgesia ( 6 ) . We found that mycolactone and 5b displaced the AT 2 R agonist with comparable efficacy ( Fig . 3E ) . Finally , since BU formation involves primarily the destruction of human dermis by mycolactone , we used primary human dermal fibroblasts ( HDF ) to model the potential ulcerative properties of 5b in vivo . As shown in Figure 3F , HDF displayed a high susceptibility to mycolactone - mediated killing , with a 50 % loss in cell viability upon incubation with nanomolar concentrations of mycolactone for 48 h . In support for safe use in humans , the cytotoxicity of variant 5b was markedly lower . Table 1 summarizes the IC 50 measured for mycolactone and 5b in the biochemical and cellular assays described above . They show that 5b conserved the biological activities of mycolactone to different degrees . Capacity to bind AT 2 R expressed on recombinant cells was largely preserved in 5b , suggesting that full and truncated molecules may have comparable analgesic effects in vivo . Variant 5b also mimicked mycolactone for inhibition of cytokine production by PMN , MDM and CD4 + T cells , with a 162 - 320 fold reduction in activity . Importantly , anti - inflammatory effects were always observed in the absence of cytotoxicity . In fact , the viability of PMN and CD4 + T cells was not altered by exposure to mycolactone or 5b , in the conditions tested . In the mycolactone - susceptible MDM and HDF , 5b was 514 and 1910 times less toxic than mycolactone , respectively . In addition to be synthetically simpler than the mycobacterial factor , 5b may therefore have a broader therapeutic window . Mycolactone and 5b both protect against chronic skin inflammation We used the PMA mouse model of chronic skin inflammation ( 27 , 28 ) to evaluate the anti - inflammatory potential of mycolactone and 5b in vivo . A 0 . 5 mg / kg dose was chosen for mycolactone , which is the maximum concentration allowing injections at > 2 days intervals without induction of skin ulceration . Because it was less potent than mycolactone in cellular assays , we administered 5b at 5 mg / kg , corresponding to the maximum solubility of the 10x injection solution in PBS . Repeated applications of PMA on the back of hairless mice ( from D 1 to D 8 then at D 10 and D 12 , Fig . 4A ) triggered a visible inflammation of dorsal skin ( Fig . 4B ) , characterized by cell infiltrates in dermis and epidermis , vascular dilation and tissue thickening ( Fig . 4C - D ) . Notably , intraperitoneal injections of mycolactone at D 0 , D 4 , D 8 and D 12 , and to a lower extent 5b , significantly reduced both macroscopic and microscopic signs of inflammation ( Fig . 4B - C , Table S1 ) . Of note , the protection afforded by 5b was more similar to that of mycolactone in skin areas situated at the periphery of the site of PMA application ( Fig . S4 ) . In histopathologic scoring of skin inflammation , 5b more closely resembled mycolactone’s anti - inflammatory effects in the dermis ( Fig . S4 ) . In this tissue , a marked reduction in the recruitment of both acute and chronic inflammatory cells , fibrosis and vascular damage could be observed in both mycolactone - and 5b - treated mice . Systemic mycolactone and 5b relieve local inflammatory pain Anti - nociceptive activity of mycolactone was recently demonstrated by injection of mycolactone in mouse footpads and local assessment of pain sensitivity to a thermal stimulus ( 6 ) . Having shown that mycolactone and 5b exert anti - inflammatory effects at a distance from the injection site , we investigated whether systemic delivery of the molecules induced local control of pain . We used the formalin assay in mice , as it is considered a reliable model of nociception that allows to discriminate inflammatory and non - inflammatory pain ( 29 ) . Injection of a formalin solution into mouse hindpaws induces two distinct periods of stereotypical licking and biting behaviors . The first 5 minutes reflect a direct effect on nociceptors ( acute pain ) while the second phase , lasting from 10 to 40 min , involves primarily inflammatory processes ( Fig . 5A ) . Figure 5B shows that intraperitoneal injection of mycolactone ( 0 . 5 mg / kg ) or 5b ( 5 mg / kg ) 1 h before formalin injection had no effect on the early phase of the assay . In contrast , both molecules were anti - nociceptive in the late phase ( Fig . 5C ) , demonstrating their systemic and selective effect against inflammatory pain . As a centrally acting analgesic , morphine was anti - nociceptive in both phases . DISCUSSION Pathogenic species of mycobacteria have evolved to produce original polyketide synthase products , with virulence and immunomodulatory properties ( 30 ) . This is well exemplified by M . ulcerans , which differs from its M . marinum ancestor essentially by the presence of giant plasmid - encoded polyketide synthases producing mycolactone ( 31 , 32 ) . Using cellular models , we and others have shown over the past few years that in addition to cause the formation of painless ulcers , mycolactone is a natural immunosuppressor operating via a novel mechanism of action ( 12 - 15 , 17 , 18 , 33 ) . Here , we demonstrate that mycolactone can be used therapeutically to suppress inflammatory responses . In agreement with cellular assays demonstrating its inhibitory activity on cytokine production by activated neutrophils , macrophages and T cells , systematically delivered mycolactone was effective at limiting inflammation in mouse models of skin inflammation and rheumatoid arthritis ( Fig . S5 ) . Mycolactone was recently reported to reduce pain locally , by stimulating the angiotensin / Cox - 1 / PGE 2 pathway in neurons , and potentially other AT 2 Rs expressing cells such as macrophages or fibroblasts ( 34 ) . In the present study , we showed that mycolactone is effective at controlling inflammatory pain generated distantly . Whether this analgesic effect operates via AT 2 Rs , suppression of inflammatory cytokine production , or both mechanisms , will require more investigations . Our observation that mycolactone selectively reduces inflammatory pain in the formalin test in mice does not allow us to discriminate between one or the other of these mechanisms , as PGE 2 and cytokine release both develop during the late phase . However , the high potency of mycolactone and 5b in suppressing inflammatory cytokine production , including pro - algesic TNF - α ( Fig . 3 ) , strongly suggests that this immunomodulatory activity is at play . The identification of the yet mysterious molecular receptor by which mycolactone blocks cytokine production will be a profitable area of research , as it will allow to dissect further the mechanisms of its analgesic properties . Since mycolactone is not easily amenable to large - scale synthesis , we aimed to determine whether its structure could be simplified without loss in biological activity . In vitro and in vivo assays identified the 5b subunit as an alternative to full mycolactone retaining capacity to block cytokine production by neutrophils , macrophages and lymphocytes , although with less potency . From a clinical perspective , 5b offers several advantages over the natural molecule , in addition to being easier to chemically synthesize . Firstly , its smaller size ( 572 vs 743 Da ) should allow a better distribution of the product throughout the fluids and tissues of the body . Secondly , cellular assays showed that 5b retains the desirable ( immunomodulatory and AT 2 R binding ) properties of mycolactone relatively better than its undesirable ( cytotoxic ) ones . Accordingly , 5b delivered at 5 mg / kg > 3 times at 2 days intervals was not ulcerative in mice . In comparison , injections of mycolactone at this frequency , and at ten times lower concentrations , caused skin lesions . The dosage regimen used in the present work to demonstrate the protective efficacy of 5b could therefore be intensified to improve clinical benefit , without inducing side effects . In conclusion , our study provides the proof - of - concept that mycolactone derivatives have a therapeutic potential . It paves the way for future research on mycolactone - inspired molecules , for the treatment of inflammatory pain and inflammatory diseases . MATERIALS AND METHODS Study design This study was designed to evaluate the potential of mycolactone , and a series of truncated synthetic variants of this natural product , as clinical immunosuppressants . A first screen of the molecules was performed in human cell lines , leading to the identification of a lead candidate retaining the immunosuppressive properties of mycolactone relatively better than its cytopathic activity . The translational potential of mycolactone and synthetic surrogate was then evaluated in functionally relevant subsets of human primary cells ( from at least three donors ) and mouse models of inflammatory disorders ( PMA - induced skin inflammation and formalin - induced pain ) . Mean clinical scores of inflammation were determined in mice randomly grouped on a weight basis , in a double blind manner . Outliers were defined as at least 1 . 5 x IQR greater than the upper quartile , or 1 . 5 x IQR less than the lower quartile ( IQR being the interquartile range = upper quartile value minus lower quartile value ) . There was no outlier in the skin inflammation study . Those detected in the formalin - induced pain assay were excluded from the statistical analysis . Natural mycolactone and synthetic variants Mycolactone was purified from Mycobacterium ulcerans bacterial pellets ( strain 1615 , ATCC 35840 ) then quantified by spectrophotometry ( 3 , 35 ) . Modular variants of mycolactone were synthesized as described ( 20 , 23 ) . Stock solutions of mycolactone and variants were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) , then diluted 1000x in culture medium for cellular assays or 10x in phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) before injection in animals . In all cases , controls exposed to the same volume of vehicle were included . Cell cultures HeLa cells ( ATCC CCL - 2 TM ) , Jurkat E6 . 1 ( ATCC TIB - 152 TM ) T cells and adult HDF ( Life Technologies , C - 013 - 5C ) cells were cultured in RPMI Glutamax TM ( Life Technologies ) , supplemented with 10 % heat - inactivated fetal calf serum ( FCS ) ( Invitrogen ) and penicillin / streptomycin ( 100 U / ml , 100 µg / ml ) . Human primary T cells were isolated from blood donors by Ficoll density gradient centrifugation and CD4 + T cell purification by negative depletion ( Miltenyi Biotec ) . Human primary macrophages were obtained from peripheral blood - derived monocytes , isolated by adhesion to tissue culture plastic - ware and cultured with 10 ng / ml human GM - CSF ( Peprotech ) for 7 - 12 days . For PMN isolation , blood samples from normal human donors drawn in EDTA were fractionated by density centrifugation on Lympholyte - Poly separation medium ( Cedarlane Labs ) as described ( 36 ) , and PMN maintained in X - Vivo 15 medium ( BioWhittaker ) . Assays of cytotoxic and immunosuppressive activity Detachment - induced cell death studies used HeLa cells seeded in 96 - well plates ( 10 4 cells / well ) and incubated with variants or mycolactone ( 16 µ M ) , or vehicle as control , for 48 h prior to enumeration of cells excluding Trypan Blue . The differential impact of mycolactone and 5b on the viability of human primary HDF , MDM and CD4 + T lymphocytes was measured with the methyl - thiazolyl - tetrazolium ( MTT ) reduction assay . We used phosphatidylserine exposure ( Annexin V staining ) and loss of membrane integrity ( propidium iodide ( PI ) staining ) to further assess the induction of apoptosis in human primary CD4 + T lymphocytes and PMN . Immunosuppressive activity on T cells was measured through the inhibition of IL - 2 and IFN - γ production by Jurkat or human primary CD4 + T lymphocytes incubated with mycolactone or 5b for 1 h prior to 16 h of activation with PMA / IO , as described ( 13 ) . Human primary PMN were incubated with mycolactone or 5b for 1 - 24 h before 2 h of activation with 100 ng / ml PMA . Human primary MDM were incubated with mycolactone or 5b for 1 h prior to 16 h of activation with 1 µ g / ml LPS . Supernatants of PMN and MDM were then collected to quantify TNF - α release using ELISA . Mean percentages of inhibition of viability or cytokine release were calculated in duplicates , relative to vehicle controls . Competitive binding to AT 2 R Differential binding of mycolactone and 5b to AT 2 R was assessed through dose - dependent displacement of the binding of an agonist radioligand ( [ 125 I ] CGP 42 , 112A at 0 . 01 nM ) from recombinant HEK cell membrane preparations ( Cerep Inc , Seattle , WA , Assay reference 0026 ) . Mice Studies on PMA - induced skin inflammation and formalin - induced pain used Hairless mice ( Skh - 1 ) and OF1 mice ( Crl : OF1 ) respectively , both purchased at Charles River and housed in conventional animal facilities of ETAP - Ethologie Appliquée . Before experimentation , animals were housed for 5 days in temperature - , humidity - and light - controlled conditions ( inverted 12 h light - dark cycle , light off at 8 am ) . Mice between 7 and 9 weeks of age were used in compliance with the European Communities Council Directive of 22 September 2010 on the approximation of laws , regulations , and administrative provisions of the Member States regarding the protection of animals used for scientific purposes , the rules edicted by the ASAB Ethical Committee for the treatment of animals in behavioral research and teaching ( Animal Behavior 2006 ; 71 : 245 - 253 ) , the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the UK legislation of in vivo aspects in inflammation research . The studies received the approval by the French Ministry of Higher Education and Research ( agreements no . CELMEA - 2012 - 0021 and 00404 . 01 ) . PMA - induced skin inflammation Hairless Skh - 1 mice were randomized in 4 groups of 6 mice after the acclimatization period . Inflammation was induced by a daily application of 20 µ g of PMA on dorsal skin , from D 1 to D 8 then at D 10 and D 12 , as previously described ( 27 ) . Mycolactone ( 0 . 5 mg / kg ) , 5b ( 5 mg / kg ) , or vehicle as control , were injected intraperitoneally at D 0 , D 4 , D 8 and D 12 . Administration of mycolactone or 5b with this regimen did not induce tissue damage at the site of injection . Inflammation of mouse dorsal skin was scored daily by clinical examination of the animals , and measure of an index of cutaneous inflammation ( 0 [ no or no further skin inflammation ] , 1 [ weak skin inflammation ] , 2 [ moderate skin inflammation ] , 3 [ important skin inflammation ] , and 4 [ very important skin inflammation ] ) in three areas : the site of PMA application , the periphery of this site and the rest of the mouse dorsum . A global score of the external aspect of cutaneous inflammation was then calculated , corresponding to the sum of these 3 measures ( Table S1 ) . Mice were sacrificed at D 14 , and photos of the mouse dorsum were taken . Biopsies were harvested at the different sites , fixed and stored in Roti ® - Histofix 4 % solution ( Carl Roth , Karlsruhe , Germany ) for histological examination at different depth of 6 - 10 cross - sections ( 5 µ m thickness ) and stained with hematoxylin and eosin . Inflammation was scored in epidermis , dermis and hypodermis on the basis of tissue - specific histopathological parameters . A global histopathological score was then calculated ( 0 - 44 ) , corresponding to the sum of these measures ( Table S1 ) . Formalin - induced pain The analgesic properties of mycolactone and 5b were tested in the formalin - induced paw licking test ( 37 , 38 ) in OF1 mice . Briefly , mice were randomized in 5 groups of 8 mice after the acclimatization period . Mycolactone and 5b were administered intraperitoneally at 0 . 5 and 5 mg / kg respectively , 60 minutes before the subcutaneous injection of the right hind - paw with 10 µ l of a 5 % formalin solution . Two negative control groups , injected with PBS ( neutral ) or ethanol vehicle ( vehicle ) were tested in the same conditions . A group injected with 3 mg / kg morphine 15 minutes before formalin injection was used as a positive reference . The duration of formalin - injected paw licking and the number of body tremors during the early phase ( 0 - 5 min ) and the late phase ( 10 - 40 min ) were recorded . Statistical analysis Data of the animal studies were analyzed with the Kruskal - Wallis test followed in case of significance ( p < 0 . 05 ) by the Mann - Whitney U test ( two - sided ) to compare each treated group with its vehicle control . Statistical treatments were performed with the Statview ® 5 software ( SAS Institute Inc . , USA ) and values of P ≤ 0 . 05 were considered significant . The Prism software ( 5 . 0d ; La Jolla , CA ) was used for graphical representation . SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS Fig . S1 .

C57Bl6 mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories and KRN TCR transgenic mice on a C57Bl6 background ( KRN ) provided by D . Mathis and C . Benoist were bred to NOD mice to generate K / BxN mice . Passive arthritis was induced by intravenous injection of 34 µl serum from K / BxN mice . Mice ( n = 8 ) were subcutaneously injected at the base of the tail with Mycolactone ( 0 . 5 mg / kg ) or vehicle as control at days - 1 and 1 . Arthritis was scored daily for ten days from day 2 post injection of serum , by clinical examination ( index of all four paws was added : 0 [ unaffected ] , 1 [ swelling of one joint ] , 2 [ swelling of more than one joint ] , and 3 [ severe swelling of the entire paw ] ) . Ankle joints were fixed and decalcified in Formical - 4 ( Decal Chemical Corp , NY , USA ) for two weeks and embedded in paraffin .
