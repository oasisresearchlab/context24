Bone Research ( 2016 ) 4 , 16050 ; doi : 10 . 1038 / boneres . 2016 . 50 ; published online : 13 December 2016 INTRODUCTION Bone or osseous tissue is a signi ﬁ cant and dynamic supporting connective tissue that continues to remodel and rebuild throughout the lifetime of an individual . Since bone is a scaffold of the body that is responsible for support , protection , locomotion and load bearing . In addition , it also undertakes responsibility for hematopoiesis , mineral homeostasis and other functions . Currently , musculoskeletal maladies that result in tissue degeneration and in ﬂ ammation are the main reasons for the disability and associated diseases around the globe . 1 In 2013 , as reported in the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 ( GBD 2013 ) led by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation ( IHME ) , the burden caused by musculoskeletal maladies around the globe was 149 435 700 disability - adjusted life - years ( DALYs ) , that mainly included rheuma - toid arthritis , osteoarthritis , gout , low back and neck pain and other musculoskeletal disorders . 2 DALY is a unit to express the health losses from a type of disease and injury which computes the years of living with disability and years of life lost . 3 Even though bone tissue has internal repair and regeneration capacity , healing of large - scale bone defects caused by trauma , infection and tumor still needs external interventions . 4 There is , therefore , a huge demand for technologies and materials to ameliorate such kind of maladies . Nanomaterials are synthetic or natural materials that have less than 100 nm size in either direction . 5 Technically , any material at nanoscale can be regarded as nanoma - terial , but for better biomedical applications , the size should be in the range of 10 – 100 nm . Size above 100 nm may induce embolism and can be phagocytized and removed by the spleen , whereas reticulo - endothelial system and kidneys can readily clear the materials with size less than 10 nm . 6 Moreover , the size below 10 nm is more toxic and reactive due to higher surface density and increased surface reactive electrons . Nano - biomaterials are structural analogs to various body proteins , receptors , ligands and DNA ( typically 5 – 20 nm size ) . This allows them to interact freely with various body receptors , easily cross - ing the cell membrane . 7 Nano - biomaterials are widely used in gene therapies , 8 nano - drug delivery systems , 9 cancer and various other disease theranostics , 10 – 14 sono and photo - dynamic therapies , 15 prosthetic orthopedic implants , 16 tissue engineering , 17 and so on . Nano - biomaterials combined with other medical methods may therefore have a key role in the near future . 18 In this review , we mainly focus on the recent advances in nanomaterials application for bone tissue repair and prosthetic implants used to support the skeletal system . Conventional biomaterials that are used for bone tissue amelioration have been reported to have complications 1 State Key Laboratory of Bioelectronics ( Chien - Shiung Wu Lab ) , School of Biological Science and Medical Engineering , Southeast University , Nanjing , China ; 2 Department of Biomedical Engineering , School of Basic Medical Sciences , Nanjing Medical University , Nanjing , China and 3 Hunan Key Laboratory of Green Chemistry and Application of Biological Nanotechnology , Hunan University of Technology , Zhuzhou , China Correspondence : Nongyue He ( nyhe1958 @ 163 . com ) Received : 28 June 2016 ; Revised : 19 September 2016 ; Accepted : 30 September 2016 Citation : Bone Research ( 2016 ) 4 , 16050 ; doi : 10 . 1038 / boneres . 2016 . 50 www . nature . com / boneres that result in elevated implant failure rate and delayed bone reparation . In this review , we will focus on the recent advances in nanotechnology for bone and supporting tissues reparation and amelioration . BONE BIOLOGY AND REGENERATION Macroscopically , bone tissue evolves into a variety of appearances to support different functions . To simplify the system , bones can be classi ﬁ ed based on shape ( that is , long , short , ﬂ at , and irregular bone ) , location ( that is , axial and appendicular bone ) , or composition ( that is , compact or spongy bone ) , and so on . Depending on their function , bones are only different in the pattern of arrangement , though they are all composed of same materials . The bone matrix Bone matrix consists of organic component , inorganic mineral component and water . Organic component accounts for approximately 25 % of the weight of bone matrix , which includes type I collagen ( ~ 90 % ) and other non - collagenous proteins ( for example , sialoprotein and osteopontin ) . 19 The non - collagenous proteins and proteo - glycans account for a small total weight of organic component , though they still have an important role in osteoblast differentiation and tissue mineralization . 20 The mineral compartment of bone contributes to ~ 65 % of the bone matrix by weight ( primarily in the form of calcium hydroxyapatite ( HA ) – Ca 10 ( PO 4 ) 6 ( OH ) 2 ) . The bone micro - environment and nanocomposites biocompatibility are highly preferred when bone repair nanoscale materials are selected or designed . Spongy bone and compact bone There are two types of bone tissue present in most of the bones in the body ; these are compact bone and spongy bone , representing 80 % and 20 % of the total bone mass , respectively . Compact bone , is formed by cylindrical construction called Haversian or osteons systems and has an ordered histological pattern . The osteons run parallel to long bones and each of them contains lamellae that encircle a Harversian canal . Nerves and vessels go through the centric osteons canals whereas nutrients and waste products diffusion is limited . To exchange materials between the osteocytes and blood vessels , all the canaliculi build a branching network throughout compact bone . Based on the structural variations , bone regenera - tion materials should provide an adequate scaffold to support the autologous tissues , that is , shape and structure . Progress in bone fracture healing Bone tissue repair and regeneration is a dynamic process that starts with proliferation and migration of osteoprogeni - tor cells , ﬁ nally realizing the reconstruction of bone with differentiation of osteoprogenitor cells and bone ECM formation . The scaffold materials which load different growth factors and drugs have achieved a great progress in bone tissue engineering . 21 BMPs are members of a TGF - β family 22 – 23 that can signi ﬁ cantly promote ossi ﬁ cation in endochondral cells in mice after subcutaneous injection . Moreover , in vivo studies reported death of mice in early stages of develop - ment due to lack of BMP - 2 or BMP - 4 . 24 To date , even though the BMPs role in bone regeneration remains a challenge , some clinical studies give interesting clues . For instance , in fracture mouse model , the RNA levels of BMPs were tested during the course of damaged bone reparation . The results demonstrated that the BMP - 2 and BMP - 4 were expressed higher in early stages while BMP - 5 , BMP - 6 , and BMP - 7 were expressed in terminal stages . 25 In humans , the expression of BMP - 2 , BMP - 3 , BMP - 4 , and BMP - 7 represents regional differences in a callus tissue , BMP - 3 and BMP - 7 by higher expression in generation of new osteo - blasts while BMP - 2 and BMP - 4 mainly exist in the mature bone tissue or hypertrophic chondrocytes . 26 All the clinical and pre - clinical researches support BMPs as an important factor in bone repair and clinical application . 27 – 28 Wnt signaling molecules also have crucial role in regulating cell function , especially in osteogenesis and differentiation . Many Wnt proteins ( for example , Wnt1 , Wnt3a , Wnt4 , Wnt5 , Wnt10b and Wnt13 ) have key roles in regulating bone formation . 29 The Wnt proteins can pro - mote proliferation of mesenchymal stem cell ( MSCs ) and their osteogenic differentiation ; however , it can also inhibit the formation of cartilage cells and fat cells . 30 Zhong et al . 31 found in rat models that , Wnt signaling members expressed signi ﬁ cantly , both at transcription level and protein synthesis after bone defect occurred . Chen et al . 32 , 33 found that fracture and β - catenin gene deletion in mice model can increase the proliferation of MSCs in the damage region , but they will differentiate to chondrocytes instead of osteoblasts , leading to the failure of bone repair . These results show that the Wnt / β - catenin signaling path - way is the core of mammalian bone biology and may provide new strategy for bone regeneration . 34 The active factors that are loaded on scaffold materials , such as BMPs , Wnt , TGF - β , FGF , and VEGF can assemble the osteoprogenitor cells and induce them into speci ﬁ c cells , further regulating the regeneration of bone tissue and formation of ECM . 35 In vivo studies also con ﬁ rmed that the growth factor could enhance the reparation of various fractures ( that is , cannot heal itself after certain period ) . 36 Bone Research ( 2016 ) 16050 Advances in nano scaffolds for bone repair H Yi et al 2 Requirements for materials in bone regeneration in ﬂ ammation Any material that has been utilized in bone repairs and as prosthesis should be highly acceptable to the biological system , with less adverse effects . In case of bone regeneration , various factors are affecting the healing process either that in ﬂ uence this process independently or as co - factor with other multiple factors . Mentioned below are some of the most pivotal properties of nanoscale biomaterials and composites for bone repair . Biocompatibility . A perfect bone repair scaffold materi - als should neither suppress the activity of normal cells nor toxicity during and after implantation . 37 In addition , it should also have osteogenesis - induced effects that may promote adhesion and proliferation of osteoblast or MSCs to form ECM . Cells can grow well in the three - dimensional ( 3D ) microenvironment composed of nano - ﬁ bers . This is mainly because of a larger speci ﬁ c surface area that can promote adsorption of proteins , cell adhesion and growth . 38 Meanwhile , more and more nanomaterials are being synthesized with good biocompatibility for biome - dical applications . 39 – 40 Mechanical property . The bone repair scaffold should satisfy the mechanical strength and provide transfer properties . Mechanical strength of bone tissue from cancellous to density has a broad range . The differences between mechanical strength and geometrical mechanics in bone tissue make it dif ﬁ cult to design an ideal scaffold . 41 At the same time , various nanomaterials with good mechanical property are designed , such as nano ﬁ bers , nanopillars , nanoparticles , and nanocomposites , 42 which may help in this challenge . Vesicular structure . The vesicular structure is a necessity for bone repair scaffold materials with porous diameter in at least 100 μ m , to ensure the transportation of nutrients and oxygen . 43 It was found in one research study that scaffold materials with aperture size of 200 – 350 μ m are best for bone tissue growth . 44 In addition , recent studies have shown that the scaffold with multiple aperture sizes have better repair effect than materials with only large aperture . 45 The bone repair materials have been success - fully prepared by using polymer , ceramic , metal , and composite materials . Porous metal scaffolds can satisfy the mechanical requirements but cannot realize fusion with implants and tissues . Moreover , the metal ion will dissociate after implantation , which is also a serious problem that needs to be addressed . 46 Bioabsorbability . Biological absorbability of the scaffold materials is another key factor for bone tissue regeneration . 37 An ideal scaffold material should be degraded in vivo at a certain time , with a controllable absorption rate that will ﬁ nally provide a space for new bone generation . The degradation time for scaffold should also satisfy the application requirements , such that the materials used in spinal fusion need to be degraded after 9 months or longer , whereas materials in skull or max - illofacial bone should degrade in 3 – 6 months . The nanoscale scaffold materials are porous and biodegrad - able that can also provide mechanical support during the bone repair . 47 Angiogenesis . An important requirement for bone repair materials is to promote the angiogenesis due to higher blood demands in the bone tissues . 43 , 48 – 50 The supply of oxygen and nutrients are indispensable for cells and tissues growth within the scaffold in vivo . 49 The in ﬂ amma - tory reaction for wound healing can induce spontaneous formation of blood vessels after scaffold implant . 43 It needs several weeks to form a vascular network ; however , most scaffold materials do not have the ability to induce angiogenesis . In addition , incorrect or insuf ﬁ - cient angiogenesis may hinder the delivery of oxygen and vital nutrients , which may result in uncontrolled differentia - tion or apoptosis of the cells . 51 NANOMATERIALS APPLIED IN BONE REPAIR AND REGENERATION The bone fracture , osteoporosis , osteoarthritis , and various neoplastic maladies are the most common clinical pro - blems associated with bone and skeletal system . These common problems may be associated with malnutrition , aging , hormonal imbalance or trauma . It is estimated that around 2 . 2 million bone tissue graft transplants are performed all around the globe annually . 52 The autograft is most common orthopedic implant but has certain well - documented limitations ( that is , resorption , donor site morbidity , compromised supply , and rejection rate of up to 50 % at some sites 53 – 54 ) . Mostly , the complicated and multiple fractures due to trauma or age ( mostly at hip joint , that is , femur head fractures ) are supported with prosthetic implants for proper healing . These implants are comprised of various materials known as biomaterials . Nevertheless , after 10 – 15 years on average , the traditional implant failure is associated with biomaterial associated in ﬂ ammation , loosening , wear or tear debris , osteolysis and autoimmune reactions . 55 These snags urge for the development of biomaterials with greater cytocompatibility and long lasting life , with higher patient ’ s quality of life . The role of nanotechnology and nanomaterials therefore becomes very pivotal . Various nanocomposites , materials and particles have been applied to mimic the growth of bone Bone Research ( 2016 ) 16050 Advances in nano scaffolds for bone repair H Yi et al 3 tissues , lower the autoimmune reactions and keep check on microbial infections . 56 – 59 Herein , we also mainly focus on the nanomaterials role in bone tissue repair , support , and maintenance . In ﬂ uence on bone regeneration Organic bone tissue has various protein ( collagen , ﬁ bro - nectin , laminin , and vitronectin ) and water as soft hydrogel nanocomposites , whereas HA and Ca 10 ( PO 4 ) 6 ( OH ) 2 are hard inorganic components for the bone . 60 The HA is present in nanocrystal line form which is 20 – 80 nm long and 2 – 5 nm thick , whereas the other proteins in the ECM are also at nanoscale size . This structural analogy allows the nanomaterials to interact easily with bone tissue and in ﬂ uence its functionality . Among the proposed nano - scaffolds for bone regeneration , Cerium ( Ce - HA ) 61 based structures are among the leading candidates for bone tissue engineering . Similarly , a Mg - HA / collagen type I scaffold may also have great utility in bone regeneration . 62 Besides , nano - HA together with chitosan ( CS ) , Jiang et al . 63 reported sodium carboxymethyl cellu - lose ( CMC ) hybrid membrane that was curled in a concentric manner to realize an anisotropic spiral – cylind - rical scaffold . The cylinder - shaped scaffold has similarity to natural bone expedited complete in ﬁ ltration of bone tissues in vivo and ﬁ nally realized osteointegration and functional reconstruction of damage bone , as shown in Figure 1a . Materials , at nanoscale , have been reported with better cell functionality than micro or macro scaled materials . 64 The ECM provides scaffolds for the growth , proliferation and in ﬂ uence functionality of various cells . The nanoscale materials mimic the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways of osteocyte differentiation and mobility . Cells in various parts of the body exist in either two - dimensional ( 2D ) or 3D environment , for example , stem cells in the intestinal crypts exists in 2D environment , whereas stem cells in bone marrow exist in 3D environment . 65 The nanomaterials may provide the desired environment for the proliferation of various cells in a bone niche . Similarly , the magnetic nanoparticles in addition to in ﬂ uence on osteocytes intrinsic pathways , may also act as mechanical stimulus that will help in the healing process . 66 The silk ﬁ broin - hydroxybutyl chitosan blended nano ﬁ bers successfully provided scaffold for the growth of porcine iliac endothe - lial cells . The nano ﬁ bers provided typical ECM to cells , where these cells formed endothelial monolayer with higher con ﬂ uency . 67 In Figure 1b , Wang et al . 68 developed apatite - collagen - polycaprolactone ( Ap - Col - PCL ) compo - sites that showed excellent bioactivity to promote fast bone regeneration in rabbit model with fractional long bone defect . They combined rapid prototyping ( RP ) fabrication technology and 3D functionalization strategy for biomimetic deposition and collagen incorporation . These composite materials showed outstanding mechan - ical properties similar to cancellous bone , good biode - gradability , and hierarchical architecture of three nano – micro – macro levels . 68 Bioactive materials Bioactivity is the ability for a material to mimic response in living system . 69 The orthopedic bioactive materials should elicit the biological response at interface and build a strong bond between the material and bone tissue . 70 Hence , the role of bioactivity is inevitable for biomedical applications of biomaterials . The bioactive materials for bone repair are mainly divided into osteoconductive and osteoproductive , depending upon the rate of implant and its tissue interaction . 71 The bioactive materials are mainly fabricated by either tailoring of bioactive composites and coatings or molecular surface tailoring . The later one is ideal for bone growth promoting factors , that is , BMPs . They are considered most important factors for the proliferation and growth of the bone tissue . 72 The nanoarrays of gold has immobilizing effect on BMP - 2 , which allows the controlled release of BMP - 2 that may have important role during the bone tissue repair via osteoblasts . 73 – 74 The BMP - 2 signals , differentiation and proliferation were also found to be signi ﬁ cantly increased after treating cells with ceramic conjugated nanoparticles . 75 Nano ﬁ brous membranes ( NFMs ) , for instance , with BMP - 2 in the core and silk ﬁ broin / chitosan / Nanohydroxyapatite ( SCH ) as the shell , were developed and tested both in vitro and in vivo for modulation of bone regeneration , results also suggesting the NFMs as an excellent scaffold for bone tissue engineering . 76 ( Figure 2a ) Similarly , collagen - containing hydrogel was seeded with magnetic nanoparticles to target TWIK - related K ( + ) channel ( TREK ) - 1 for enhanced mineralization on experimental basis . Moreover , the bone mineralization was signi ﬁ cantly increased by mechano - transduction . 77 In ﬂ uence on bone tissue cells and BMSCs . In osteogen - esis and bone mineralization studies , various biochemical mediators , including ascorbic acid , dexamethasone , BMPs , and β - glycerophosphate , are supplemented to differentiating medium or incorporated in biomaterials . However , some studies reported nanoscale composites with osteoinductive effect without addition of any bio - chemical mediator , suggesting strong in ﬂ uence of dimen - sional structure niche and cell ’ s shape . 78 Notably , Khanna et al . 79 reported chitosan - polygalactouronic acid hydro - xyapatite ( Chit - Pga - HA ) nano ﬁ bers with osteoconductive and osteoinductive properties by mimicking the natural bone mineralization and collagen formation . Similarly , Bone Research ( 2016 ) 16050 Advances in nano scaffolds for bone repair H Yi et al 4 Roohani - Esfahani et al . 80 coated biphasic calcium phos - phate struts with bioactive glass nanoparticles and found 14 times increase in compressive strength and enhanced differentiation of primary human derived bone cells by upregulating the Runx2 , osteopontin and sialoprotein genes . Moreover , the recent ﬁ ndings by Tutak et al . 81 suggested that poly ( ε - caprolactone ) ( PCL ) nano ﬁ bers promoted the differentiation of human osteoprogenitor cells by changing the organelle structure and positioning , which resulted in altered cells functionality . Besides , as reported by Tang et al . , 82 recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein - 2 ( rhBMP - 2 ) was loaded on a tri - modal ( macro / micro / nano ) mesoporous bioactive glass scaffold ( TMS ) with enhanced compressive strength . They tailored a 7 . 5 nm , 3D cubic mesoporous structure for a “ size - matched entrapment ” of rhBMP - 2 , so the TMS / rhBMP - 2 could achieve sustained release and appealing bone regeneration capacity ( Figure 2b ) . The nanostructure arrays of various biomaterials ( for example , polymethylmethacrylate ( PMMA ) 120 nm pit and 100 nm diameter size with 300 nm interspace ) have been reported with ef ﬁ cient osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells BMSCs . 83 Similarly , Tarpani et al . 84 used 130 nm silica ( SiO 2 ) nanoparticles functionalized by amino group ( SiO 2 - N ) and silver ( SiO 2 - Ag ) nanoparticles for the growth of human BMSCs Figure 1 .

Bone Research ( 2016 ) 16050 Advances in nano scaffolds for bone repair H Yi et al 5 and observed good interaction between the silica nanoparticles and BMSCs , making it a strong candidate for future bone tissue engineering . The recent ﬁ ndings by Rehman et al . 85 also suggested strong proliferating effect of TiO 2 nanowhiskers and tetra sulphonatophenyl porphyrin ( TSPP ) nanocomposites on rheumatoid arthritis BMSCs . In addition , Zuyaun et al . 86 used the mesoporous silica based nanocomposites loaded with BMP - 7 to differentiate the BMSC from osteocytes by slowly and constantly releasing the BMP - 7 as trigger of the osteogenesis . Xia et al . 87 reported the highly interconnected microporous HA bio ceramic scaf - folds whose surface was modi ﬁ ed by nanosheet , nano - rod and micro - nano - hybrids . The materials not only promoted cell attachment , proliferation , spreading and osteogenic differentiation of adipose derived stem cells ( ASCs ) , but also enhanced the expression of angiogenic factors . The combination of the HA scaffolds with nano - surface and ASCs could enhance both osteogenesis and angiogenesis in a rat critical - sized calvarial defect model . 87 Extra cellular matrix and bone supporting tissues . The bone tissue is a part of complex skeletal system that is also comprised of various tissues ( for example , ligaments and tendons ) . The attached ligaments and tendons after trauma may also need regeneration ; hence , the nano - technology may be applied for enhancing strength and biocompatibility . Recently , Sheikh et al . 88 incorporated multi - walled carbon nanotubes into polymeric nano ﬁ bers to form ideal candidate for bone tendon and ligament repair after trauma . They reported that addition of MWCNTs to the polymeric nano ﬁ bers increased the tensile strength from 11 . 40 ± 0 . 9 to 51 . 25 ± 5 . 5 Mpa . 88 Moreover , the ﬁ broblast cells attachment and higher viability rate indicated the biocompatibility of the said arti ﬁ cial liga - ments / tendon candidate . The ligament advanced rein - forcement system ( LARS ) is also considered a promising graft when nanomaterials , such as nano - silica , are applied to its surface ; both the biocompatibility and ligament reconstruction effectiveness of LARS are improved . 89 Moreover , some other studies reported the co - electrospun scaffold which was based on nano - hydroxyapatite particles , as well as Medtronic ’ s recombi - nant , could up - regulate the expression of BMP - 2 and osteopontin on mineral - containing region , and may promote the regeneration of the ligament - bone interface . 90 – 91 Figure 2 .

Bone Research ( 2016 ) 16050 Advances in nano scaffolds for bone repair H Yi et al 6 Composite materials Various synthesized hydrogels are good for providing extra cellular matrix for proliferation of cells during the healing process . The higher water content provides cells friendly microenvironment for performing various functions . Mostly during bone fracture the vasculature is compromised , which can be mimicked by various factors . The use of composite materials may allow the angiogen - esis without any vital biochemical factor . The recent ﬁ ndings by Mammadov et al . 92 suggest that the use of polymers to mimic angiogenesis without any soluble factor is a new approach in tissue regeneration . The same technique may be used for bone regeneration , especially in complex fractures where the vasculature is compromised . 92 Other composite nanomaterials , such as Ca 2 + - induced Bombyx mori silk sericin ( BS ) / HA , reduced graphene oxide ( rGO ) / HA and recombinant human vascular endothelial growth factor ( rhVEGF ) / nano - HA / coralline blocks could also signi ﬁ cantly promote the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of the BMSCs for bone repair . 93 – 95 Zhao et al . 96 recently used tetra sulphonatophenyl porphyrin derivatives adjuvant with TiO 2 nanowhiskers for theranostics of Rheumatoid Arthritis . These nanocomposites were not only biocompatible but also had protective effect on the synovial milieu and long bones tissue . 96 Similarly , nano - TiO 2 has been used for coating of orthopedic prosthetic implants . 97 The TiO 2 nanotubes have been used in the articular joints , that is , hip and knee joint , to minimize the wear and tear effect ; however , it was not very successful due to in ﬂ ammatory reactions . The nanos - cale TiO 2 particles coated on the surface of prosthetic implants are safer with enhanced bone mineralization and osteoblast adhesion . 98 – 99 Earlier studies reported that orthopedic prosthetic implants coated with TiO 2 nano - tubes were successfully loaded with non - steroidal anti - in ﬂ ammatory drugs ( for example , Ibuprofen 100 ) and variety of antibiotics and antibacterial ( for example , gentamycin 101 and cefuroxime 102 ) to keep check on infection and in ﬂ ammation , without compromising the adhesion of osteoblasts to the implanted biomaterial . Bone tissue requires dynamic mechanical stimulation for its proper functionality . In nanotherapeutics , it can be ful ﬁ lled by various magnetic nanoparticles that upon exposure to magnetic ﬁ eld may alter the cells physiological and biochemical environment by moving the charged particles into the cell by enhanced membrane permeability . 64 Nano - coating of implants Nanoscale structures and coating of various prosthetic implants is of higher interest in orthopedic surgery due to lower debris generation , especially in articular joints . The prosthesis main body is comprised of metallic alloy ( that is , Ti - 6AL - 4 V , cobalt - chromium - molybdenum ) which articulates against polymer or ceramic - polymer surface ( alumina , aluminia - zirconia , ultra - high molecular weight PE ) . The excellent tribo - corosion and biocompatibility can be achieved via surface coating with nanotubes , nano - whiskers , diamond , and graphite like carbon , titanium , 103 and tantalum . 104 Along with anti - friction coating , the nanobiomaterials are also favored for control of infections by loading various antimicrobials on prosthesis surface . The nano - titania and silver particles coating on the prosthetic implants are very extensively used in orthopedic prosthetic implants to control post - operative complications and infections . Recently , Singh et al . 105 prepared 25 – 35 nm HA coated on the Ti - alloy to lower the graft - versus - host disease ( GVHD ) to orthopedic implants and increased its biocompatibility . Stanic et al . synthesized Silver ( Ag 2 O ) ﬂ uroappatite nanopowder with 80 nm average length and 20 nm width , ﬁ nding excellent antibacterial effect on klebsiella pneumoniae , Staphylococcus aureus and Micro - coccus luteus due to the antibacterial effect of sliver , which can be potentially explored in orthopedic implants . 106 Another biomimetic HA nano - construct was synthesized by Koirala et al . , 107 which could modify a Ti implant . The nano - HA covered with a phospholipid bilayer may support long - term sustainability of implants . Although , the nanomaterials used in bone implants are also having adverse effects on the bone cells , for example , the silver ( Ag ) nanoparticles ( 80 nm ) and ions are reported with delayed differentiation of human MSCs to osteocytes and adipocytes , even at biocompatible concentration . 108 3D technology In early eighties of twentieth century , Charles Hull was the ﬁ rst to report 3D technology for printing various objects . Afterwards , applications of the 3D technology got momentum in various ﬁ elds , including biomedicine , for tissue regeneration and transplant , especially bone . Among various major concerns in the 3D technology , the bioresorption and biocompatibility are major issues . Most of the important bone materials used in bone 3D printing include calcium phosphate ceramics and cements , HA , brushite , monetite , β - tricalcium phosphate ( TCP ) and bioactive glass mixture , due to their comparable analogy to bone minerals and higher biocompatibility . 109 – 110 Porosity of the implant is pivotal for the growth and attachment of bone tissue to implant . The ideal porosity has been reported with 30 % – 70 % prosthetic comprised of 500 – 1000 μ m , respectively . 111 However , the bone tissue is comprised of various nano ( collagen – I and Bone Research ( 2016 ) 16050 Advances in nano scaffolds for bone repair H Yi et al 7 other proteins ) to macro structures , and subtle disturbance or disorientation in these structures will lead to maladies ( for example , osteogenesis imperfecta and brittle bone dis - ease ) . Recently , Kang et al . 112 demonstrated a mandible bone reconstruction using human amniotic ﬂ uid – derived stem cell ( hAFSC ) - laden hydrogel , a mixture of PCL and TCP , and Pluronic F127 ( Figure 3b ) . The PCL / TCP and hAFSCs mixed with the composite hydrogel were printed in a type I pattern with a Pluronic F127 temporary support ( Figure 3c ) . After induction of osteogenic differentiation for 28 days ( Figure 3d ) , they stained the structures with Alizarin Red S ; staining at the surface of the 3D bone structures indicated calcium deposition in the hAFSC - laden hydrogel ( Figure 3e ) . The HA based nanocomposites are favored for the nano 3D structure formation due to promotion of cell organization , proliferation and allowance of free movement of nutrients to the developing tissues . The recent ﬁ ndings by Jun et al . suggest that sphere shaped nano - HA - chitosan - gelatin based scaffolds accelerated the ﬁ broblast iPSC ( induced pluripotent stem cells ) osteogenesis as compared with rod shaped nano - HA - chitosan - gelatin scaffold both in vivo and in vitro . 113 CONCLUSION In summary , biomedical applications of the nanoscale materials in amelioration and regeneration of skeletal system , especially in bone and supporting tissues , are highly appreciated in modern therapeutics and surgery . The 3D scaffold , structural analogy , biocompatibility , growth promoting properties , and time - bound degrad - ability of nanoscale materials make them ideal candidates for orthopedic prosthetic surgeries and bone reparation .
