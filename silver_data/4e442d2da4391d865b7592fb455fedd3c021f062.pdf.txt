E ﬃ ciency and speed of cargo delivery are especially high for carrier vesicles that fuse with the cellular plasma membrane . This occurs for lipid mixture containing equal amounts of the cationic lipid DOTAP and a neutral lipid with an additional few percents of an aromatic substance . The fusion ability of such particles depends on lipid composition with phosphoethanolamine ( PE ) lipids favoring fusion and phosphatidyl - choline ( PC ) lipids endocytosis . Here , we examined the e ﬀ ects of temperature , ionic strength , osmolality , and pH on fusion e ﬃ ciency of cationic liposomes with Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) cells . The phase state of liposomes was analyzed by small angle neutron scattering ( SANS ) . Our results showed that PC containing lipid membranes were organized in the lamellar phase . Here , fusion e ﬃ ciency depended on bu ﬀ er conditions and remained vanishingly small at physiological conditions . In contrast , SANS indicated the coexistence of very small ( ~ 50 nm ) objects with larger , most likely lamellar structures for PE containing lipid particles . The fusion of such particles to cell membranes occurred with very high e ﬃ ciency at all bu ﬀ er conditions . We hypothesize that the altered phase state resulted in a highly reduced energetic barrier against fusion . Keywords : cationic liposomes ; membrane fusion ; lipid phases ; fusion conditions 1 . Introduction Artiﬁcial vesicles or liposomes are frequently investigated due to many applications in pharmacology and medicine . They have been used as carrier particles for various compounds , e . g . , DNA , RNA , proteins , and anti - cancer therapeutics [ 1 , 2 ] . Cargo delivery can be substantially improved using vesicle carriers that are able to fuse with the ﬁrst cellular barrier , the plasma membrane . To this end , viral membranes , which naturally contain fusogenic , membrane - associated peptides [ 1 , 3 , 4 ] and peptide - free cationic liposomes have been used with similar high - fusion e ﬃ ciency [ 2 ] . In viral carriers , proteins embedded into the lipid bilayer or associated with it are directly involved in fusion induction , as well as in processes that precede or follow membrane coalescence [ 5 – 8 ] . Synthetic liposomes can also beneﬁt from fusion peptides and proteins [ 9 , 10 ] , but their presence is not mandatory for e ﬃ cient membrane fusion induction . Cholesterol [ 11 ] , as well as DNA in lipoplexes [ 12 ] , have also been reported as membrane fusion initiators . Moreover , pure lipid bilayers assembled from phosphoethanolamines , for example , or its derivatives , are also known in the literature as fusogenic [ 13 , 14 ] . Such phospholipids , in general , have a small head group and long unsaturated chains with an inverse conical molecular Nanomaterials 2019 , 9 , 1025 ; doi : 10 . 3390 / nano9071025 www . mdpi . com / journal / nanomaterials Nanomaterials 2019 , 9 , 1025 2 of 16 shape , preferably forming three - dimensional phases like inverse hexagonal ( H II ) or cubic instead of a lamellar phase . During the phase transition from one into the other phase , a fusion - intermediate structure can form [ 14 – 19 ] . In some cases , two - dimensional lipid mixing entropy is the driving force regulating the spontaneous formation of multicomponent membranes [ 20 ] . Although such liposomes prevailed as fusogenic , they reach signiﬁcant fusion e ﬃ ciencies with living cells only in combination with a cationic lipid , e . g . , DOTAP , and an aromatic molecule , such as ﬂuorescence dyes [ 21 ] . Such so - called fusogenic liposomes ( FLs ) are able to fuse with mammalian cells with high e ﬃ ciency of about 80 – 100 % within 1 – 5 min without any toxic e ﬀ ect . As shown previously , the cargo molecules , e . g . , proteins [ 22 ] , nucleic acids [ 23 ] , or di ﬀ erent kind of lipids [ 24 ] , can e ﬃ ciently be delivered to many di ﬀ erent cell types due to successful membrane mixing of the liposomal and the plasma membranes and subsequent content release . Here , membrane fusion success correlated with the delivery e ﬃ ciency of the cargo . Therefore , we systematically varied the composition of empty FLs and identiﬁed the components essential for fusion with biological membranes [ 25 ] . Thereby , we found that a cationic lipid with an inverted conical shape and an aromatic molecule are mandatory for fusion induction . Although the addition of neutral lipids , e . g . , DPPC or DOPE , is not essential , it can be used to tune fusion e ﬃ ciency . The simple exchange of DOPE with DOPC can turn the fusion ability of liposomes from 90 % into 10 % without nominative changes either in particle size or zeta potential characteristic for the surface charge of the liposomes . The central event during membrane fusion is the merging of two membranes , which is deﬁned by the lipid matrix itself . Beside embedded proteins and lipid composition , environmental conditions determine fusion ability . For example , Zimmerberg and coworkers examined membrane fusion in a living cell system and found that it is driven by an osmotic gradient [ 26 ] , while Akimov et al . showed for a protein - free model system that changes of the environmental pH in the physiologically relevant range between 4 . 0 and 7 . 5 , notably a ﬀ ected the membrane fusion rate [ 27 ] . Because membrane fusion , in general , is in many instances dependent on environmental conditions we systematically studied the role of temperature , osmolality , pH and ionic concentration of the bu ﬀ er on the fusion e ﬃ ciency of cationic liposomes with living cells in vitro . Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) cells were used as mammalian cells , and fusion e ﬃ ciency of cationic liposomes containing phosphoethanolamine ( PE ) or phosphatidyl - choline ( PC ) as neutral compounds and an aromatic molecule were analyzed . Additionally , structural investigation of liposomes was carried out using small angle neutron scattering ( SANS ) [ 28 ] to study the inﬂuence of thermotropic lipid phases for e ﬃ cient membrane fusion . 2 . Materials and Methods 2 . 1 . Chemicals We used the cationic lipid 1 , 2 - dioleoyl - 3 - trimethylammonium - propane ( chloride salt ) ( DOTAP ) , and the neutral lipids 1 , 2 - dipalmitoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphoethanolamine ( C16 ( 0 ) PE ) , 1 , 2 - dipalmitoleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphoethanolamine ( C16 ( 1 ) PE ) , 1 , 2 - dipalmitoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine ( C16 ( 0 ) PC ) , 1 , 2 - dipalmitoleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine ( C16 ( 1 ) PC ) , 1 , 2 - distearoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphoethanolamine ( C18 ( 0 ) PE ) , 1 , 2 - dioleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphoethanolamine ( C18 ( 1 ) PE ) , 1 , 2 - distearoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine ( C18 ( 0 ) PC ) , and 1 , 2 - dioleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine ( C18 ( 1 ) PC ) . As ﬂuorescently labeled lipids 1 , 2 - dioleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphoethanolamine - N - ( dipyrrometheneborondiﬂuoride ) butanoyl ( TFPE - head ) and 1 - palmitoyl - 2 - ( dipyrrometheneboron diﬂuoride ) - undecanoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphoethanolamine ( TFPE - chain ) were applied . All mentioned lipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids , Inc . ( Alabaster , AL , USA ) and used without further puriﬁcation . The ﬂuorescently labelled lipid N - ( 4 , 4 - diﬂuoro - 5 , 7 - dimethyl - 4 - bora - 3a , 4a - diaza - s - indacene - 3 - propionyl ) - 1 , 2 - dihexadecanoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphoethanolamine ( triethylammonium salt ) ( BODIPY FL - DHPE ) and the lipid analogue 1 , 1 (cid:48) - dioctadecyl - 3 , 3 , 3 (cid:48) , 3 (cid:48) - Nanomaterials 2019 , 9 , 1025 3 of 16 tetramethylindotricarbocyanine iodide also called DiIC 18 ( 7 ) ( DiR ) was ordered from Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc ( Eugene , OR , USA ) . 2 . 2 . Preparation of Liposomes 2 . 2 . 1 . Liposomes for Treatment of CHO Cells and Microscopy Liposomes were prepared according to the method described by Kolasinac et al . with few modiﬁcations [ 25 ] . In brief , lipid components , like neutral and cationic lipids , and the ﬂuorescent compound were mixed in chloroform ( EMSURE grade , VWR , Darmstadt , Germany ) at a ratio of 1 / 1 / 0 . 1 mol / mol . Chloroform was evaporated under vacuum for 0 . 5 h . Afterward , lipids were dispersed in 20 mM N - 2 - hydroxyethylpiperazine - N - 2 ethane sulfonic acid ( HEPES ) bu ﬀ er ( VWR , Darmstadt , Germany ) at a total lipid concentration of 2 mg / mL and pH 7 . 4 ( osmolality 30 mOsm / kg ) or in distilled and deionized water at the same concentration . Bu ﬀ er osmolality was determined using a freezing point osmometer ( Osmomat 030 from Gonotec , Berlin , Germany ) . The solution was vortexed for 1 – 2 min to produce multilamellar liposomes . After homogenization in an ultrasonic bath ( Sonocool , Bandelin electronic GmbH , Berlin , Germany ) for 20 min at 5 ◦ C , mainly unilamellar vesicles were formed . Before usage , liposomes were kept at 4 ◦ C for no longer than two days . 2 . 2 . 2 . Liposomes for Small Angle Neutron Scattering ( SANS ) For SANS , preparation of liposomes was slightly altered . For these experiments , BODIPY - FL - DHPE was used as a dye . The total lipid concentration was set to 10 mg / mL . After evaporation of chloroform , the lipid ﬁlm was resuspended in 20 mM HEPES dissolved in D 2 O ( 99 atom % D , Sigma - Aldrich , Taufkirchen , Germany ) and vortexed vigorously without additional sonication . Samples were stored at − 20 ◦ C until usage . One hour before measurements , samples were thawed and vortexed vigorously before being transferred into quartz cuvettes ( 110 - QS , quartz glass , Suprasil , 1 mm path length , Hellma , Müllheim , Germany ) for SANS measurements . 2 . 3 . Cell Culture Experiments were performed on Chinese Hamster Ovary K1 cells ( CHOs ) purchased from American Type Culture Collection ( ATTC , Manassas , VA , USA ) . They were maintained in DMEM - F12 ( Sigma - Aldrich , Taufkirchen , Germany ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) ( Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc , Waltham , MA , USA ) , 10 , 000 units penicillin and 10 mg / mL streptomycin ( both Sigma - Aldrich ) . During culture , cells were kept at 37 ◦ C and 5 % CO 2 in a saturated humid atmosphere . Cell density never exceeded 80 % conﬂuence . Before microscopy , glass surfaces ( ∅ = 3 . 5 cm Petri dish ) were coated with human ﬁbronectin ( 10 µ g / mL , BD Biosciences , San Jose , CA , USA ) for 30 min at 37 ◦ C and 50 , 000 cells were seeded on them and cultivated for 24 h . Cell nuclei were stained for 15 min at 37 ◦ C with DRAQ5 ( red ﬂuorescence , Thermo Fischer Scientiﬁc , Waltham , MA , USA ) or Hoechst 33342 ( blue ﬂuorescence , Thermo Fischer Scientiﬁc , Waltham , MA , USA ) according to the manufacturer’s protocols . Furthermore , 10 µ L of the liposome stock solutions were diluted 1 / 50 with phosphate bu ﬀ er saline ( PBS , 290 mOsm / kg , 137 mM NaCl ; 2 . 7 mM KCl ; 1 . 47 mM KH 2 PO 4 ; 8 . 1 mM Na 2 HPO 4 ) at pH 5 – 9 ( adjusted by addition of 1 M NaOH or HCl ) , phosphate bu ﬀ er ( PB , 30 mOsm / kg , 2 . 7 mM KCl ; 1 . 47 mM KH 2 PO 4 ; 8 . 1 mM Na 2 HPO 4 ) , or glucose solution of deﬁned osmolality ( 30 mOsm / kg and 290 mOsm / kg ) and cells on glass substrates ( ~ 100 , 000 of cells ) were incubated in these solutions for 5 min in the incubator ( 37 ◦ C and 5 % CO 2 , saturated humid atmosphere ) . After the treatment , the suspension of liposomes was exchanged with fresh , pre - warmed cell culture medium . In some control experiments , cells were ﬁrst washed three times using a sodium heparin solution at 2 mg / mL concentration in PBS bu ﬀ er before medium exchange to eliminate remaining liposomes from the cell surfaces . For temperature - dependent experiments , 10 µ L of the liposomal stock solutions , stored at 4 ◦ C no longer than 24 h , were diluted 1 / 50 with phosphate bu ﬀ er saline ( PBS , 290 mOsm / kg ) at room temperature . Before , liposomes and cells were left for 5 min at room temperature . Immediately Nanomaterials 2019 , 9 , 1025 4 of 16 afterward , the cells were incubated with liposomal solutions at 4 ◦ C , 20 ◦ C , 30 ◦ C or 37 ◦ C for 5 min . Thereafter , they were washed by fresh , pre - warmed cell culture medium , and samples were immediately analyzed by laser scanning microscopy . 2 . 4 . Characterization of Size and Zeta Potential Distribution of Liposomes Both particle size and ζ - potential distributions were measured using a zetasizer ( Nano ZS from Malvern Instruments , Malvern , UK ) equipped with a HeNe laser ( 633 nm ) . Scattered laser light was collected at a constant angle of 173 ◦ . Prior to measurements liposome stock solutions were diluted using the appropriate bu ﬀ er . The temperature was set using the instrument thermostat . Data were collected from three independently prepared samples and analyzed using the instrument software ( DTS from Malvern Instruments ) . Reported data are mean peak position and its standard deviation ( mean ( s . d . ) ) 2 . 5 . Microscopy Samples were imaged using a confocal laser scanning microscope ( LSM 710 from Carl Zeiss MicroImaging GmbH , Jena , Germany ) equipped with a near UV laser ( 405 nm ) , an argon ion laser ( 488 nm ) , and a helium - neon laser ( 633 nm ) . Both TopFluor lipid derivatives were excited at 488 nm , and their ﬂuorescence emissions were detected using a bandpass ﬁlter BP 495 – 550 nm ( green channel ) . The lipid analog DiR and the nuclear stain DRAQ5 were excited using the 633 nm laser line , and the emitted signal was collected through the long pass ﬁlter LP 650 nm . Hoechst 33342 was excited by the 405 nm laser line , and its emission was detected using a BP 505 / 90 . For imaging , a Plan - Apochromat 40 × / 1 . 40 Ph3 ( Carl Zeiss , Oberkochen , Germany ) objective was used . To maintain appropriate culture conditions , the confocal microscope was equipped with an incubator ( Incubator XL 2 , Carl Zeiss , Oberkochen , Germany ) . Temperature and CO 2 were kept constant at 37 ◦ C and 5 % , respectively . The experiments were repeated at least three times . For each experiment minimum ﬁve images were taken , with at least one hundred cells per image . Overall , fusion e ﬃ ciency was determined from no less than 1500 cells at each condition . 2 . 6 . Analysis of Images An algorithm was developed to quantify fusion e ﬃ ciency from ﬂuorescence micrographs . It is based on staining intensity . The code was implemented in Matlab ( R2017 , Mathworks , Natick , MA , USA ) . In the ﬁrst step , individual cells were segmented . To this end , the nuclei channel was used . This image was ﬁrst smoothed ( Gaussian ﬁlter , standard deviation 3 pixels , pixel size 173 nm throughout ) and morphological opening ( disk - shaped structuring element of radius 9 pixels ) was performed . The bright nuclei were segmented using the mean grey value of the image as an intensity threshold . Subsequently , morphological opening and closing ( both with a disk of radius 5 pixels ) were performed on the mask . Next , the watershed transformation was used to separate overlapping nuclei and to segment cells . Therefore , the distance transform of the negative mask was calculated and multiplied by − 1 . Then , local minima ( depth less than 2 ) were eliminated from this resulting image , and ﬁnally , the watershed transform was applied to that image . Next , to the separated nuclei labels , the dividing lines between the “watershed” areas of neighboring nuclei , computed by the watershed transform , were used as the shape of the corresponding cell . Afterward , the ﬂuorescent lipid signal was analyzed . Since the many small , bright spots in the images indicated lumps , endocytic , or non - fused liposomes , they were removed . Therefore , the image was ﬁrst smoothed ( Gaussian ﬁlter , the standard deviation of 3 pixels ) . Then , local bright spots were detected using the algorithm described in the work of Hersch and colleagues [ 29 ] . In brief , the local z - score of each pixel was calculated within a 91 × 91 environment and segmented using a threshold of 2 for the z - score . Only regions with the area below 100 , 000 pixels × pixels were accepted . Each such region was then enlarged by morphological dilation ( the disk of radius 3 pixels ) . On the smoothed fusion signal image , all spots identiﬁed by the z - score segmentation were replaced by pixel values Nanomaterials 2019 , 9 , 1025 5 of 16 calculated by inward interpolation from the grey scale values at the rim of the spot ( MatLab function region ﬁll ) . Spot detection and interpolation of grey values were performed twice . Using the processed intensity image from the second part of the program and the cell label image from the ﬁrst part , the average grey value intensity for each cell was calculated individually . Using the same manually chosen threshold for all images , all cells were separated into fused ( all cells with an average grey value above the threshold ) and non - fused ( all cells below the threshold ) cells . 2 . 6 . 1 . Small Angle Neutron Scattering ( SANS ) SANS experiments were carried out at small angle scattering set - up KWS - 2 , operated by JCNS at Forschungsneutronenquelle Heinz Maier - Leibnitz , FRM II , in Garching ( Germany ) [ 30 ] . A wavelength of λ = 7 Å ( ∆ λ / λ = 10 % ) and sample - detector distances ( SDD ) of 1 . 58 , 7 . 58 , and 19 . 48 m were used to cover a q - range of 0 . 002 – 0 . 221 Å − 1 . The detector was a 3 He detector with a resolution of 8 mm . Exposure times were 5 min at SDD = 1 . 58 m , 10 min at SDD = 7 . 58 , and 20 min at SDD = 19 . 48 m . Samples were placed in an aluminum holder with plastic cover , and the temperature was controlled by a Peltier element combined with a counter cooling by a water thermostat . The cuvettes were Hellma quartz glass cuvettes with a 1 mm sample thickness . Experiments were performed at 37 ◦ C . The scattering of D 2 O and the empty cell were subtracted from the sample scattering taking the transmissions into account . The resulting intensities were azimuthally averaged . Good agreement was found wherever curves at di ﬀ erent SDDs overlapped . All data corrections were performed with the software QtiKWS provided by JCNS . Fitting was done by SasView software version 4 . 2 . 0 ( http : / / sasview . org ) . 2 . 6 . 2 . Model Functions Used for the Data Fitting All ﬁt functions contained a scale factor I 0 and background I b , i . e . , they were of the form I ( q ) = I 0 f ( q ) + I b ( 1 ) where q denotes the scattering vector . The scale factor contains the scattering volume and the scattering length density di ﬀ erence between solvent and structure . The lamellar model provides the scattering intensity , I ( q ) , for a lyotropic lamellar phase . A uniform scattering length density and random distribution in solution are assumed , which results in f ( q ) ∝ 1 − cos ( q δ ) δ q 4 ( 2 ) where δ denotes bilayer thickness [ 31 ] . The ellipsoid model is calculated from the form factor for randomly oriented ellipsoids of revolution with uniform scattering length density . This results in f ( q ) = [ sin ( qr ) − qr cos ( qr ) ] 2 9 ( qr ) 6 ( 3 ) with r = (cid:113) R b 2 sin 2 α + R a 2 cos 2 α ( 4 ) where α denotes the angle between the rotational axis of the ellipsoid and the q - vector , R a is its radius along this axis , and R b the radius perpendicular to it . The orientation of the ellipsoid is numerically averaged over a sphere to give the ﬁnal ﬁt model [ 28 , 32 ] . As the ﬁnal model , we used a general power law f ( q ) = (cid:107) q (cid:107) − m ( 5 ) Nanomaterials 2019 , 9 , 1025 6 of 16 2 . 7 . Statistical Analysis Statistical analyses of data were performed by one - way ANOVA using Origin 9 . 0 ( OriginLab Co . , Northampton , MA , USA ) . p < 0 . 01 was considered statistically signiﬁcant . Data are expressed as means ( s . d . ) . 3 . Results As shown recently , lipid composition strongly inﬂuences the fusion ability and fusion e ﬃ ciency of liposomes [ 25 ] . Depending on their lipid composition , liposomes are either taken up by endocytosis or membrane fusion . Here , we compared liposomes with compositions characteristic for both uptake pathways . The analyzed liposomes always contained the cationic lipid DOTAP , neutral lipid , and a ﬂuorescent dye at the molar ratio of 1 / 1 / 0 . 1 mol / mol . If the neutral lipid was a PC , endocytic uptake was expected . In the following , such liposomes will also be called “endocytic liposomes” or “Els” . However , liposomes containing a PE as neutral lipid were more able to fuse with cellular membranes [ 25 ] and are hence called “fusogenic liposomes” or “FLs” . Accordingly , PC and PE lipids with 16 and 18 carbon atoms ( C16 or C18 ) with or without unsaturation in the fatty acid chains ( ( 1 ) or ( 0 ) , respectively ) were tested as neutral compounds . Additionally , the Bodipy derivative TopFluor coupled at di ﬀ erent positions to PE ( TFPE ) or the carbocyanine dye with long fatty acid chains DiR ( for IUPAC names see Materials and Methods ) were incorporated into the liposomes and tested for fusion induction . To identify whether the di ﬀ erent ﬂuorescence signal patterns belonged to membrane fusion or endocytosis , 3D confocal imaging of CHO cells were carried out upon treatment with liposomes composed of DOPE / DOTAP / TopFluor - head ( 1 / 1 / 0 . 1 mol / mol ) ( FLs ) or DOPC / DOTAP / TopFluor - head ( 1 / 1 / 0 . 1 mol / mol ) . As shown in Figure 1A , FLs homogeneously stained the whole cellular plasma membrane while ELs was localized mainly on the cell surface without distributing in the membrane ( Figure 1B ) or internalized in the cell cytoplasm . Signal distributions were not signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by a washing step using sodium heparin , a polyanionic solution ( Figure S1 ) . Nanomaterials 2019 , 9 , x FOR PEER REVIEW 6 of 16 2 . 7 .

Liposomes containing DOPE as neutral lipid homogenously stained the plasma membranes of CHO cells in the whole temperature range from 4 ° C to 37 ° C ( see Figure 2A ) . Here , fusion efficiencies of above 80 % were determined from fluorescent micrographs ( Figure 2B ) . In contrast , liposomes containing a phosphocholine , here DOPC , as neutral lipid stuck to the cell surface resulting in an inhomogeneous dotted fluorescence pattern , and afterward were taken up by endocytosis . Internalization by endocytosis was detected in the whole temperature range from 4 °C to 37 °C ( Figure 2B ) . Despite the temperature shock inherent in the procedure , no indications for cell stress were observed . In all cases , the headgroup of the neutral lipid , PE or PC , respectively , controlled fusion ability , while chain length or saturation had much lower effects ( see Table 2 ) . Moreover , the replacement of the head labeled lipid ( TFPE - head ) as the aromatic component with a chain labeled lipid ( TFPE - chain ) or a fluorescent lipid analog ( DiR ) did not significantly influence fusion efficiency of liposomes in the analyzed temperature range ( see Table S1 ) .

Phase States of Endocytic and Fusogenic Liposomes To ﬁnd the reasons underlying the very di ﬀ erent fusion behaviors of PC and PE containing cationic liposomes , SANS analyses were carried out at the physiologically most relevant temperature of 37 ◦ C . For these measurements , liposomes were formed in HEPES bu ﬀ ered heavy water ( cf . Materials and methods for details ) . With this method , multi - dispersed , multilayered vesicles were formed . Experimental results and ﬁts are shown in Figure 3 . Nanomaterials 2019 , 9 , x FOR PEER REVIEW 9 of 16 Figure 3 .

Cyan lines indicate corresponding fits of a single measurement . 3 . 3 . Influence of Ionic Concentration The influence of the surrounding ionic concentration was examined for various ionic strengths of the medium . For the purpose of these experiments , the lipid film was hydrated in ultrapure water instead of a buffer to avoid the presence of ions in the liposomal stock solution . Subsequently , liposomes were diluted in phosphate buffer ( PB ) at low total ion concentration ( 30 mM ) or in phosphate buffer containing additional saline ( PBS ) at high total ion concentration ( 280 mM ) . The presence of ions drastically increased the hydrodynamic size of both types of liposomes ( compare Tables 1 and 3 ) and reduced the liposomal homogeneity , as shown in Table 3 . No significant differences were detected between FLs and ELs ( Table 1 ) . The analysis of liposomal zeta potential showed a significant reduction in liposomal charges of both liposomes in the presence of PBS and a moderate decrease in PB buffer compared to glucose solutions .

The fluorescence signal of liposomes after internalization was monitored by confocal microscopy . Liposomes containing DOPE as neutral lipid diluted in PB buffer showed homogeneous membrane staining with high fusion efficiencies of approximately 90 % . When the same liposomes were diluted in PBS buffer , they remained fusogenic with similar or slightly higher efficiencies ( Figure 4 ) . However , when DOPE was replaced with DOPC as a neutral component , liposomes displayed different behaviors depending on ionic strength . In PB , they fused with CHO cells with high efficiencies , while no significant fusion was detected in PBS ( Figure 4 ) . During the treatment with low ionic strength , cells Figure 3 . Scattering curves of DOPE / DOTAP / BODIPY - FL - DHPE ( 1 / 1 / 0 . 1 mol / mol ) ( black circles ) liposomes and DOPC / DOTAP / BODIPY - FL - DHPE ( 1 / 1 / 0 . 1 mol / mol ) ( red circles ) liposomes measured at 37 ◦ C . Cyan lines indicate corresponding ﬁts of a single measurement . The scattering proﬁle of DOPC containing liposomes was adequately modeled by a lamellar lipid phase , with a bilayer thickness of 42 . 7 Å . DOPE containing liposomes , however , displayed a di ﬀ erent scattering pattern with a characteristic shoulder at Q = 0 . 015 Å − 1 . The latter indicated the presence of small scale features and could not be described by a lamellar phase alone . The best ﬁt was achieved by a superposition of the scattering function of ellipsoid particles and a power law . The curve of DOPE containing liposomes could not be ﬁtted with a cylinder model . This argues against the familiar hexagonal / inverted hexagonal phase of DOPE . Also , the combination of the cylinder model combined Nanomaterials 2019 , 9 , 1025 9 of 16 with ellipsoid failed to ﬁt the curve . Additionally , combinations of models ( lamellar with ellipsoid and lamellar with power law ) did not ﬁt perfectly the speciﬁc region at Q = 0 . 015 Å − 1 . Apart from that part of the scattering curve , the lamellar model ﬁtted nicely , which indicates the presence of bilayers . The observed power law contribution is a common occurrence if the probed length scale is smaller than the scattering object ; it reﬂects local structures of the object [ 33 ] . Therefore , the agreeable ﬁt of this model combining a power law with an ellipsoid and separate ﬁtting of most of the pattern by the lamellar model leads to the following hypothesis on the structure : We propose small micelle - like structures are embedded into the lipid bilayers . The best ﬁtting power - law exponent was 2 . 99 , which can be attributed to large solid vesicles with a rough surface . The best ﬁtting ellipsoidal particles had a polar radius of 24 . 8 Å and an equatorial radius of 88 . 5 Å . The ﬁtting functions are described in the section Materials and Methods . 3 . 3 . Inﬂuence of Ionic Concentration The inﬂuence of the surrounding ionic concentration was examined for various ionic strengths of the medium . For the purpose of these experiments , the lipid ﬁlm was hydrated in ultrapure water instead of a bu ﬀ er to avoid the presence of ions in the liposomal stock solution . Subsequently , liposomes were diluted in phosphate bu ﬀ er ( PB ) at low total ion concentration ( 30 mM ) or in phosphate bu ﬀ er containing additional saline ( PBS ) at high total ion concentration ( 280 mM ) . The presence of ions drastically increased the hydrodynamic size of both types of liposomes ( compare Tables 1 and 3 ) and reduced the liposomal homogeneity , as shown in Table 3 . No signiﬁcant di ﬀ erences were detected between FLs and ELs ( Table 1 ) . The analysis of liposomal zeta potential showed a signiﬁcant reduction in liposomal charges of both liposomes in the presence of PBS and a moderate decrease in PB bu ﬀ er compared to glucose solutions .

During the treatment with low ionic strength , cells reacted on these hypo - osmotic conditions by membrane blebbing .

Influence of Osmolality To test if the remarkably different behavior of DOPC containing liposomes in PB and PBS originated from electrostatic or osmotic effects , we varied osmolality by an uncharged solute .

Liposomes containing DOPE as neutral lipid diluted in 30 mOsm / kg or 290 mOsm / kg glucose solutions fused with the cell membrane of CHO cells with similar high efficiencies of approximately 80 % . In contrast , liposomes containing DOPC as neutral component again showed fusion efficiencies that depended on osmolality . If such liposomes were diluted in 30 mOsm / kg glucose solution , significant fusion ( approx . 50 % efficiency ) was detected , while almost no fusion events were observed in 290 mOsm glucose solution ( see Figure 4 and Table 2 ) .

In contrast , liposomes containing phosphocholine , here DOPC , as neutral lipid adhered to the cell surface , which resulted in an inhomogeneous speckled fluorescence pattern . In the whole pH range from 5 to 9 , internalization by endocytosis was rarely detected with a fusion efficiency above 1 % ( Figure 5 ) . Figure 5 .

Discussion In the absence of fusogenic peptides or proteins , membrane fusion occurs in the following sequence [ 4 , 13 , 18 , 34 , 35 ] . First , the two membranes must be brought into close contact . This step requires the removal of tightly bound hydration water . Second , the locally disrupted outer membrane Nanomaterials 2019 , 9 , 1025 12 of 16 leaﬂets melt together , forming hemifusion intermediate structures called membrane stalks . Third , the inner lipid monolayers reorganize , which results in pore opening , as well as full membrane and content mixing . Each of the intermediate states is characterized by a well - deﬁned free enthalpy that together deﬁnes the activation energy barrier for fusion . Some chemical compounds , such as ions , drugs , or distinct lipids , as well as conditions like temperature , pH , or osmolality of the bu ﬀ er , can alter this barrier [ 18 , 35 ] . Because we recently analyzed the inﬂuence of the chemical composition of cationic liposomes on their fusion e ﬃ ciency with mammalian cell membranes [ 25 ] , we tackled here the e ﬀ ect of environmental conditions on fusion e ﬃ ciency . Changes of the environmental conditions such as ionic concentration , pH , or bu ﬀ er osmolality mainly inﬂuence the ﬁrst step in the fusion process . For overcoming the ﬁrst barrier and bringing the two membranes into close contact , the reduction of the water interface between the fusion partners is mandatory . For example , ions bound to the membranes ( Ca 2 + , Na + , and K + ) can modify their surface polarities , which in turn reduces the hydration - dependent intermembrane repulsion [ 34 , 36 – 38 ] . Nevertheless , our results showed that in the case of FLs , fusion e ﬃ ciency was not inﬂuenced by the ionic composition of the surrounding bu ﬀ er , suggesting the presence of another factor that is more important for the fusion process than the electrostatic interaction . Additionally , even though we observed no di ﬀ erences between size or zeta potential of fusogenic and endocytic liposomes , both types of liposomes were taken up by very di ﬀ erent cellular pathways . Also , model membrane experiments by other groups demonstrated that a mixture of giant unilamellar vesicles ( GUVs ) with opposite surface charge ( e . g . , DOTAP containing liposomes and DOPS containing liposomes ) aggregate readily and the lipid mixing e ﬃ ciency does not change with increasing ionic strength [ 39 , 40 ] . In the case of ELs , however , the ionic environment played a crucial role in membrane fusion induction . Here , an increased fusion e ﬃ ciency was detected only at a low salt concentration ( 30 mOsm / kg ) . At physiological salt concentration ( 280 mOsm / kg ) , the fusion e ﬃ ciency was reduced again . Additionally , the same trend was observed when bu ﬀ er osmolality was changed from low to high ( from 30 mOsm / kg to 280 mOsm / kg ) by adding sugar instead of salt . The only exception of PC containing liposomes showing elevated fusion capacity were liposomes with DSPC . This abnormal fusion behavior can most likely be explained by the particular phase state of DSPC in the presence of phospholipids with notably di ﬀ erent properties . For example , DSPC mixed with DMPC forms a non - ideal mixture with a broad gel - ﬂuid coexisting region [ 41 , 42 ] . We assume that such a phase coexistence , also present in a DOTAP / DSPC mixture , is favorable for the formation of fusion intermediates . Despite their extraordinary high - fusion ability , DSPC containing liposomes still showed the same trend of higher fusion e ﬃ ciency at low osmolality and ionic strength bu ﬀ ers compared to physiological conditions . Therefore , we suggest that the increased membrane fusion was caused by osmotic destabilization of CHO cells , rather than by the ionic interaction between the liposomal and the cellular membrane . In this context , the following recent observation is of interest . Middel et al . showed that repair of membrane lesions in skeletal muscle is accompanied by transiently increased concentrations of negatively charged phosphatidylserine lipids [ 43 ] . A similar mechanism might cause enhanced electrostatic attraction in osmotically stressed cell membranes . After a close contact of the two membranes , a transient disturbance of the bilayers structure and subsequent reorganization is required to overcome the energy barrier of the di ﬀ erent steps and form hemifusion intermediates [ 44 ] . It has been proposed that the phase transition between a lamellar ( L ) and an inverted hexagonal ( H II ) phase is essential for the formation of such intermediate structures [ 45 – 47 ] . Several molecules have been described as initiators for the H II phase , such as drugs , surfactants , and lipids , e . g . , PEs . However , for our fusogenic lipid mixture that contains DOPE , SANS measurements are not compatible with a H II phase ( Figure 2 ) , but rather suggest a mixture of lamellar membranes with membrane compartments of high curvature ( with polar radii of 24 . 8 Å and an equatorial radius of 88 . 5 Å , see Figure 2 ) . Bulavin and Lebovka reported similar ﬁtting models for rough interfaces of microcapsules carrying ﬁve or eight polymer bilayers [ 33 ] . We propose here that membrane fusion is facilitated by the observed micelle - like inclusions in the membranes . As they exhibit curvatures Nanomaterials 2019 , 9 , 1025 13 of 16 of similar magnitude than lipid H II phases , we expect an e ﬀ ect of comparable size . Because the fusogenic lipid mixture studied here can fuse with any biological membrane [ 21 ] without any inﬂuence of physical conditions such as temperature , osmolality , ionic strength , or pH of the bu ﬀ er , as shown above , we hypothesize that the observed structure generally occurs for this lipid mixture and causes the observed high fusogenicity . Lipid mixtures in the lamellar phase , here the ELs , have been found to be non - fusogenic . For a better understanding of the second and the third steps of membrane fusion , we have to take into consideration the e ﬀ ective shape of the membrane - forming molecules [ 13 ] . Lipids with an e ﬀ ective cylindrical shape ( e . g . , PC ) form bilayers with zero spontaneous curvature . Lipids obtaining inverted conical shapes lead to positive membrane curvature , while lipids with conical e ﬀ ective molecular shape ( e . g . , PE ) form membrane structures with negative curvature . Such membranes are postulated as more fusogenic [ 48 , 49 ] . Our results corroborate this hypothesis , namely , that the lipid composition has a high impact on liposomal behavior [ 25 ] . Here , we found that cationic liposomes containing PEs with a conical e ﬀ ective molecular shape fuse with the highest e ﬃ ciency with the plasma membrane of CHO cells , therefore , they are assigned as fusogenic , while PC containing cationic liposomes remain rather non - fusogenic . Similar behavior was also found for PE and PC containing cationic liposomes when they were incubated with red blood cells [ 50 ] . The fact that such FLs do not show any considerable di ﬀ erences in fusion e ﬃ ciency with cells depending on the temperature , osmolality , or ionic concentration of the bu ﬀ er indicates that the presence of a 3D lipid phase formed by spherical membrane structures with high curvatures lowers the energy barrier for fusion signiﬁcantly , and thus , e ﬃ ciently facilitates membrane fusion . In this context , the additional structures within the vesicle lamellae can be considered a pre - formation of the intermediate structures that are necessary for the lamellar fusion . Since they are already present , they do not need to be formed during the fusion process , and therefore , lower the barrier for the occurrence of fusion . 5 . Conclusions For a lipid formulation that fuses very e ﬃ ciently with cell membranes , we ﬁnd a structure characterized by the simultaneous presence of lipid bilayers and small micelle - like structures with high surface curvatures . We propose that this peculiar structure is present at a broad range of conditions and gives rise to e ﬃ cient fusion . In contrast , for lipids that are mainly organized in a lamellar phase , like the endocytic liposomes analyzed in our study , bu ﬀ er conditions strongly inﬂuence membrane fusion . However , under physiological conditions , overall fusion e ﬃ ciencies remain very low .
