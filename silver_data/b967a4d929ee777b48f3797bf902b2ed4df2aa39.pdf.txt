The enzyme F 1 - ATPase has been shown to be a rotary motor in which the central g - subunit rotates inside the cylinder made of a 3 b 3 subunits . At low ATP concentrations , the motor rotates in discrete 120 8 steps , consistent with sequential ATP hydrolysis on the three b - subunits . The mechanism of stepping is unknown . Here we show by high - speed imaging that the 120 8 step consists of roughly 90 8 and 30 8 substeps , each taking only a fraction of a millisecond . ATP binding drives the 90 8 substep , and the 30 8 substep is probably driven by release of a hydrolysis product . The two substeps are separated by two reactions of about 1 ms , which together occupy most of the ATP hydrolysis cycle . This scheme probably applies to rotation at full speed ( , 130 revolutions per second at saturating ATP ) down to occasional stepping at nanomolar ATP concentrations , and supports the binding - change model for ATP synthesis by reverse rotation of F 1 - ATPase . The ATP synthase is an enzyme ubiquitous in bacteria , plants and animals , which synthesizes ATP from ADPand inorganic phosphate using proton ﬂow through a membrane 1 – 3 . F 1 , a water - soluble portion of the ATP synthase , is the site of ATP synthesis , whereas protons ﬂow through the membrane - embedded F o portion . At least in vitro , F 1 can hydrolyse ATP to pump protons through the F o portion in the reverse direction . Isolated F 1 only hydrolyses ATP , and is called F 1 - ATPase . Its subunit composition is a 3 b 3 gde . The prevailing view is that ATP hydrolysis / synthesis in F 1 is coupled to proton ﬂow in F o through the rotation of a common shaft , of which the g - subunit of F 1 is a part . This rotational coupling mechanism was initially proposed by Boyer 1 – 3 , and by others 4 – 6 . Later , a crystal structure of F 1 showed that a rod - shaped g - subunit is surrounded by a cylinder made of three a - and three b - subunits , arranged alternately 7 ( Fig . 1a ) . An analogue of ATP , ADP and none were bound to the three b - subunits , indicating that sequential ATP hydrolysis on the three b - subunits would indeed induce rotation of the central , asymmetrical g - subunit . Rotation of the g - subunit in an isolated F 1 during ATP hydrolysis has been demonstrated experi - mentally by various methods 8 – 10 . We have visualized the rotation of the g - subunit under an optical microscope by ﬁxing F 1 on a surface and attaching an actin ﬁlament to the g - subunit as a marker of its orientation 10 . At nanomolar ATP , the actin ﬁlament rotated in discrete 120 8 steps 11 , consistent with the pseudo - three - fold symmetrical structure 7 of F 1 . The rotation rate was close to one - third of the rate of ATP hydrolysis in solution , suggesting that one ATP molecule is consumed per 120 8 step 11 . At high ATP concentrations , however , the actin rotation was smooth rather than stepwise , and the rotation was much slower than ATP hydrolysis . Viscous friction imposed on the actin ﬁlament prevented fast rotation of F 1 and obscured the stepping behaviour . Here we have used a smaller marker , a colloidal gold bead of 40 - nm diameter , for which the viscous friction is 10 - 3 to 10 - 4 times that for actin ( Fig . 1b ) . In the resultant high - speed rotation , we were able to resolve substeps . In this study we investigate the magnitudes , speeds , and timings of the substeps , and we also look at : ( 1 ) the motor speeds at no load ; ( 2 ) whether the motor uses different rotary mechanisms at low and high speeds ; ( 3 ) which parts of hydrolysis reactions drive the substeps ; and ( 4 ) what structural changes may underlie the substeps . Full - speed rotation with 40 - nm beads Bead rotation was imaged by laser dark - ﬁeld microscopy 12 ( Fig . 1c ) , articles 898 NATURE | VOL 410 | 19 APRIL 2001 | www . nature . com Biotin BSA F 1 Bead b a c d Laser beam Scattered light Iris Objective · 100 DFC Specimen Streptavidin a a a b ATP b ADP b Empty g Figure1 Observation ofF 1 rotation . a , Atomic structure 7 ofF 1 - ATPaseviewed from the F o side ( top in b ) . b , Side view of the observation system .

The 40 - nm bead appeared as a spot of diffraction - limited size ( , 300 nm ; Fig . 1d ) . When a bead is attached obliquely ( Fig . 1b ) , rotation of the g - subunit will result in a circular movement of the bead image . Some beads showed rotation ( Fig . 1d ; movies in Supplementary Information ) , and motions of these beads were analysed by calculating the centroid of the bead image 13 . The rotation diameter of bead centroid ranged between 25 – 55 nm . Diameters up to , 60 nm are possible for the height of F 1 of , 10 nm and the linker lengths of , 5 nm for streptavidin 14 and , 10 nm for BSA 15 ( Fig . 1b ) . Rotation was stepwise at all ATP concentrations examined ( see below ) . To see whether the friction on the 40 - nm bead impeded F 1 rotation , we varied the frictional load by attaching single or duplex polystyrene beads ( 108 , 196 or 291nm ) to the g - subunit . At both 2 mMand 2 m M ATP ( Fig . 2 ; red and blue circles , respectively ) , time - averaged rotation rates showed saturation behaviour at small fric - tion . Maximal rotation rate depended on ATP concentration [ ATP ] , but increasing [ ATP ] beyond 2 mM did not accelerate rotation ( see below ) . Thus , at 2 mM ATP , the 40 - nm bead rotated at the full speed of the F 1 motor , which was 134 revolutions per second ( r . p . s . ) at 23 8 C ; the bead was not an impeding load for F 1 . At saturating speeds , all beads rotated stepwise . On the load - dependent portions in Fig . 2 , however , bead rotation was smooth , as was rotation of actin at these ATP concentrations 11 . The load dependence of actin rotation 11 ( Fig . 2 ; triangles ) is consistent with the bead assay . One rotary mechanism at all speeds The time - averaged rate of rotation showed simple Michaelis – Menten dependence on [ ATP ] ( Fig . 3 ; the maximal rate at inﬁnite [ ATP ] , V max = 129 r . p . s . ; Michaelis constant , K m = 15 m M ) , suggest - ing that one mechanism accounts for rotation in the nM – mM range . This idea is corroborated by observations 11 , 16 , 17 that the torque and its angle dependence , as well as mechanical work done in a 120 8 step , are independent of [ ATP ] over the nM – mM range . Also , the apparent rate of ATP binding , k ATPon , given by 3 V max / K m of ( 2 . 6 6 0 . 5 ) · 10 7 M - 1 s - 1 agrees with previous estimates based on the analysis of step intervals at nanomolar ATP 11 , 18 . As seen in Fig . 3 , the rotation rate was close to one - third of the rate of ATP hydrolysis for bead - free F 1 in solution , supporting the contention that one ATP molecule is consumed per 120 8 rotation 11 , 16 – 18 . The hydrolysis rate , however , was lower , particularly around 50 m M . A probable cause is MgADP inhibition : F 1 is stochastically inactivated during ATP hydrolysis , when it binds MgADP tightly 17 , 19 , 20 . Although we started with nucleotide - free F 1 , some inactivation may have proceeded during the mixing time of , 2 s . Indeed , the rate of inactivation increases with [ ATP ] and reaches , 0 . 3 s - 1 at . 10 m M ATP 20 , the position of the concavity in Fig . 3 . Higher activity at still higher [ ATP ] is accounted for by binding of ATP to non - catalytic a - subunits , which tends to restore the hydrolysis activity 19 . Lauryldodecylamine oxide ( LDAO ) , a suppressor of the MgADP inhibition 19 , produced hydrolysis kinetics parallel to the rotation kinetics , although V max / 3 ( 82 s - 1 ) was only , 60 % of V max for rotation ( Fig . 3 ) . The 120 8 step consists of 90 8 and 30 8 substeps At 8 , 000 frames per s , steps were clearly resolved in the rotation of 40 - nm beads , even at saturating ATP . At 2 mM ATP , only 120 8 steps were seen ( Fig . 4a , b ) , whereas at 20 m M or 2 m M ATP , the 120 8 step was further split into roughly 90 8 and 30 8 substeps ( Fig . 4c – f , where each panel shows a continuous record ) . We call the interval between a 30 8 substep and a 90 8 substep a ‘0 8 dwell’ and the interval between 90 8 and 30 8 substeps a ‘90 8 dwell’ . In Fig . 4c – f , 0 8 dwells fall on black horizontal lines that are separated from each other by 120 8 , and 90 8 dwells fall on grey lines that are 30 8 below the black lines . The 90 8 dwells were about a few ms in duration , on average , both at 2 and 20 m M ATP , whereas 0 8 dwells became longer at 2 m M . The implica - tion is that F 1 waits for the arrival of ATP during the 0 8 dwell , which is terminated by a 90 8 substep induced by ATP binding . The subsequent 90 8 dwell is for a process or processes independent of [ ATP ] . This scheme predicts that , at [ ATP ] , K m = 15 m M , 0 8 and 90 8 dwells have approximately equal lengths , as was observed articles NATURE | VOL 410 | 19 APRIL 2001 | www . nature . com 899 0 . 1 1 10 100 1 , 000 10 – 4 10 – 3 10 – 2 10 – 1 10 0 10 1 10 2 Viscous friction ( pN nm s ) R o t a t i o n r a t e ( r . p . s . ) 40 nm Duplex291 nm Duplex196 nm 108 nm Duplex108 nm Figure 2 Relationship between rate of bead rotation and viscous friction on the bead .

At 2 mM ATP , the expected rate of ATP binding is ( 2 . 6 · 10 7 M - 1 s - 1 · 2 mM ) < 5 · 10 4 s - 1 . Then , 0 8 dwells will be , 0 . 02 ms and will not be detected at the current resolution . The absence of substeps in Fig . 4a , b is thus explained . We place dwells in Fig . 4a , b on grey lines , because they must be 90 8 dwells according to this explanation ( see also Fig . 7 ) . The 30 8 substeps were not always clear , but we could easily locate , in rotation records , steps that spanned most of a 120 8 interval ( , 90 8 or , 120 8 step ) . Positions of the bead centroid in 0 . 25 – 0 . 5 - ms intervals before ( red ) and after ( green ) these main steps are shown in the insets of Fig . 4 . At 2 m M and 20 m M ATP , red and green spots are separated by , 30 8 , showing the presence of substeps , whereas spots overlap with each other at 2 mM ATP . The traces are distorted , presumably because of oblique rotation on an obliquely situated F 1 . Circles on each trace are the projection of three equally spaced pairs of dwell positions on a circular trajectory oblique to the surface . A search for the best ﬁt with the observed traces show the separation between red and green circles to be 29 8 6 7 8 ( mean 6 s . d . ) for 13 runs at 2 , 6 and 20 m M ATP ; and 4 8 6 3 8 for 7 runs at 2 and 6 mM . Figure 5 shows histograms of angular positions . Separations of peaks at 20 m M ATP ( crosses ) averaged 35 8 6 13 8 ( mean 6 s . d . for 15 peak pairs ) . Substeps are less obvious at 2 m M , but histograms for the 2 - ms intervals before and after the main steps ( green ) show similar peak separations . Taking these and other experimental uncertainties into account , we estimate the substep sizes to be within 90 8 6 10 8 and 30 8 6 10 8 .

The average ( thick cyan line ) shows that a whole 120 8 step completes within 0 . 25 ms ( two frames ) at saturating ATP . This value is an upper boundary because faster transients are unresolved with the camera that we used . Thus , time for the mechanical stepping ( the times needed to reorientate the g - subunit through 90 8 and 30 8 ) occupies , 10 % of the ATPase cycle time . The 90 8 substeps at 2 m M ATP are also within 0 . 25 ms ( Fig . 6b ) . Stepping is fast , the instantaneous speed being well above 1 , 000 r . p . s . , whether [ ATP ] is above or below K m for rotation . Substeps of 90 8 by ATP binding and 30 8 by product release Figure 6c shows averages of all steps observed at indicated [ ATP ] . Presence of distinct and fast , 90 8 substeps is clear at all [ ATP ] , 60 m M , although whether the remaining , 30 8 is also stepwise cannot be judged in this ﬁgure . Fit with grey lines indicates the substep size to be 90 . 2 8 6 0 . 3 8 . The averaging was made after steps other than the central one were eliminated from each step record , such that it started with a near - 30 8 dwell and ended with a , 120 8 dwell . When the last dwell at 120 8 was too short to be distinguished , the previous dwell at , 90 8 was extended to the right edge of the ﬁgure ( see Methods ) . Thus , the portion of the curves between - 30 8 and 0 8 reﬂects the distribution of dwell times at 0 8 that were started at the end of a substep from - 30 8 to 0 8 , and terminated by a central 90 8 substep . The dwell is [ ATP ] - dependent , and can be explained by termination by ATP binding at the rate k ATPon = 3 . 0 · 10 7 M - 1 s - 1 estimated from Fig . 8 ( Fig . 6c ; grey lines ) . The kinetics above 90 8 , in contrast , is [ ATP ] - independent , except that the amplitude decreases with [ ATP ] . The decrease is accounted for by the fact that , at [ ATP ] > K m , the dwell at , 120 8 becomes too short and is not represented in our averaging pro - cedure . As shown ( grey lines ) , the kinetics are in accord with the scheme in Fig . 7a where two , 1 - ms reactions govern the dwell at , 90 8 ( the two reactions are deduced from Fig . 8 ) . Our proposed scheme is summarized in Fig . 7a . ATP binding drives a 90 8 substep ( A ! B ) . Next are hydrolysis reactions that are mechanically silent ( B , C ) . Eventually , the last hydrolysis product of the previously bound ATP ( ADP , phosphate , or both ) is released , accompanying a 30 8 substep ( C ! A 9 ) and resetting the system to the initial A state except for the 120 8 rotation that has taken place . At high [ ATP ] , another 90 8 substep occurs immediately , and thus the two substeps are not resolved ( Fig . 7b ) —this is why we propose that both of the hydrolysis products must have been released by the end of a 30 8 substep . At [ ATP ] , K m , ATP binding and hydrolysis take similar time , and 90 8 and 30 8 substeps are equally spaced . Two , 1 - ms reactions before a next step Figure 8a shows histograms of dwell times between two main steps ( 90 8 or 120 8 ) that were easily discerned at all [ ATP ] . At [ ATP ] p K m ( 0 . 02 and 0 . 2 m M ) , the histograms were ﬁtted with a single expo - nential ( pink lines ) with a rate proportional to [ ATP ] ( Fig . 8b ; open cirlces ) , indicating that ATP binding alone sets the pace of rotation at these [ ATP ] . At 2 m M ATP , the histogram starts at the origin at zero dwell and shows a distinct peak , indicating the appearance of another rate - limiting reaction . Between 2 and 60 m M , the histo - grams are explained , roughly , by the ATP - binding reaction and an ATP - independent , , 0 . 5 - ms - 1 reaction ( Fig . 8b ) . At [ ATP ] . > K m = 15 m M , the histograms still show a distinct peak , indicating the presence of at least two reactions . A ﬁt with two rate constants indicated both to be , 1 ms ( Fig . 8b ; ﬁlled black circles ) , which , taken together , can account for the 0 . 5 - ms - 1 reaction at intermedi - ate [ ATP ] . Thus , at least three rate constants , two for the , 1 - ms reactions and one for ATP binding , are required to describe the rotation kinetics at all [ ATP ] . Global ﬁt to all histograms ( green lines ) showed k ATPon to be ( 3 . 0 6 0 . 1 ) · 10 7 M - 1 s - 1 ( consistent with the estimate from Fig . 3 ( above ) and previous values in actin 11 and single - ﬂuorophore 18 assays ) , and the other two rates to be 1 . 64 6 0 . 06 ms - 1 and 0 . 71 6 0 . 02 ms - 1 . Of the latter two reactions , we cannot discriminate which is ﬁrst , and the two rates do not differ signiﬁcantly ( see also Fig . 8b ) . Thus we propose in Fig . 7a that two , 1 - ms dwells separate the 90 8 and 30 8 substeps . A simple explanation is that the ﬁrst dwell is terminated by release of a hydrolysis product ( phosphate or ADP ) and the second by release of the other product . Alternatively , the ﬁrst reaction may be splitting of ATP to ADP and phosphate , and the second reaction the release of the two .

Discussion In our rotation scheme ( Fig . 7a ) one or two of the three catalytic sites are ﬁlled at any time with ATP or its product ( s ) of hydrolysis . This is the so - called bi - site mechanism 2 , 3 , 17 , which is the norm at least at submicromolar [ ATP ] . Previously we have demonstrated rotation at [ ATP ] as low as 20 nM , indicating that bi - site hydrolysis accompanies rotation 11 and that bi - site is the fundamental mode of rotation 17 . Present results suggest bi - site to be the norm also at physiological ( mM ) [ ATP ] . Alternation between two - ﬁlled and three - ﬁlled states ( the tri - site mechanism ) has been proposed for hydrolysis at high [ ATP ] , from non - Michaelis – Menten kinetics 22 , 23 as in Fig . 3 , and from quenching of tryptophan ﬂuorescence in the active sites 24 . These results indicating the tri - site mechanism may have been inﬂuenced by the MgADP inhibition 25 . In contrast , ATP synthesis by ATP synthase is insensitive to the inhibition and seems to proceed by a bi - site mechanism 26 . Our rotation assay focuses only on active F 1 , and is unaffected by the inhibition . The rotation rate was higher than one - third of the hydrolysis rate at all [ ATP ] ( Fig . 3 ) , implying that part of F 1 in solution was not fully active already at several seconds after exposure to ATP . We do not necessarily deny possible occupancy of three sites , but we claim that ﬁlling all sites does not signiﬁcantly accelerate , nor add power to , rotation . Presence of the substeps indicates the appearance of two meta - stable structures during rotation , inwhich the equilibrium positions of the g - subunit differ by , 90 8 ( Fig . 7a : A versus B or C ) . If our bi - site interpretation is correct , the crystal structure in Fig . 1a probably corresponds to the two - nucleotide structure B ( or C ) . The other central structure with one nucleotide ( A ) is yet to be solved . A structure 27 reported recently indicates that the protruding portion of the g - subunit , where the bead was attached , is torsionally ﬂexible , therefore it is possible that the substeps revealed here might be an artefact : intrinsic steps of the g - subunit are always 120 8 , whereas the bead is somehow obstructed at 90 8 and lags behind for a few ms . We dismiss this possibility because ( 1 ) the bead rotated over 120 8 within 0 . 25 ms at 2 mM ATP ; ( 2 ) the dwell time at 90 8 was independent of the radius of bead rotation , which presumably reﬂects differences in bead attachment ; and ( 3 ) larger beads did not show any sign of obstruction . In Fig . 7a , binding of ATP drives the 90 8 substep . By reciprocity , the afﬁnity of the b - subunit for ATP , on the left of the arrow on the central g - subunit , must increase as the g - subunit rotates 6 , 16 , 17 , 28 . Likewise , because release of ADP ( or phosphate , or both ) drives the 30 8 substep , the afﬁnity of the b - subunit for ADP , on the right of the arrow , must decrease as the g - subunit rotates over the last 30 8 . The magnitude of these afﬁnity changes can be estimated as below . We have shown that , at least under a high load , F 1 does 80 – 90 pN nm of mechanical work per 120 8 step 11 and that the torque it produces is nearly independent of the rotation angle 16 , 17 ( the potential energy “ for g - subunit rotation is linearly downhill ) . Rotation of 291 - nm beads gave similar results ( R . Y . , unpublished observations ) . These results , combined with Fig . 7a , suggest the diagram in Fig . 7c for “ : in state A in Fig . 7a , “ A is minimal at 0 8 ; ATP binding produces state B where “ B is linearly downhill toward its minimum at , 90 8 ; “ C is also minimal at , 90 8 ; product release recovers state A 9 where “ A 9 is again linearly downhill toward 120 8 . Solid lines have the constant slope of 80 pN nm of work per 120 8 as indicated by experiment , whereas dashed lines are drawn arbitrarily to provide minima at experimental positions . Afﬁnity for ATP is proportional to exp [ ( “ A - “ B ) / k B T ] , where k B T , 4 . 1 pN nm is the thermal energy at room temperature 6 , 28 . Thus , rotation from 0 8 to 90 8 accompanies an increase in the afﬁnity of more than exp [ ( 60 pN nm ) / k B T ] , 2 · 10 6 . The afﬁnity for ADP , ~ exp [ ( “ A 9 - “ C ) / k B T ] , decreases more than exp [ ( 20 pN nm ) / k B T ] , 10 2 . These afﬁnity changes account for ATP synthesis by forced clockwise rotation of the g - subunit . Starting from state A 9 in Fig . 7a , the afﬁnity for ADP of the empty b - subunit on the right of the arrow increases as the g - subunit rotates clockwise , and this b - subunit will pick up ADP from the medium . Further rotation decreases the afﬁnity for ATP of the b - subunit carrying the previously synthesized ATP ( on the left of the arrow ) , and this ATP will eventually be released . In this simple scheme , it is the central , asymmetrical g - subunit that dictates which of the three b - subunits should change its afﬁnity , and to what extent . A corollary of the ‘ g - dictator model’ is that tri - site operation may take place during hydrolysis if ADP release is somehow slowed down , for example by partial inhibition . After a 90 8 substep , the g - subunit is already pointing close to the next b - subunit and signals this b - subunit to bind ATP . ATP binding may therefore occur without waiting for the 30 8 substep accompanying ADP release ; however , this would be an inefﬁcient tri - site mechanism with no additional power and speed , as we claim above . Synthesis ( or hydrolysis ) of ATP on a b - subunit does not require much energy , because ATPand ADP + phosphate are in equilibrium on the b - subunit 21 , 26 . This is in accord with our observation that the hydrolysis reaction , which we presume to occur during the two , 1 - ms reactions , is mechanically silent . The principal function of hydrolysis is to allow the release of bound ATP by converting it to products , thereby resetting the machine for the next round of stepping . Complete mechanical silence , however , is unfavourable for efﬁcient ATP synthesis , because clockwise rotation should release ATP , not ADP + phosphate . Indeed , it has been indicated that the equilibrium shifts toward ATP during synthesis 26 . One such mechanism ( a switch - less model for F 1 motor 16 , 17 ) is suggested in Fig . 7c , where the minimum in “ C ( after hydrolysis ) is placed slightly to the right of the minimum in “ B ( before hydrolysis ) . Such a slight shift would be undetectable at the present resolution . articles 902 NATURE | VOL 410 | 19 APRIL 2001 | www . nature . com 10 – 1 10 1 10 3 10 – 2 10 0 10 2 10 4 R a t e c o n s t a n t ( s – 1 ) [ ATP ] ( m M ) 0 10 2 , 500 5 , 000 0 25 250 500 0 30 25 50 0 15 25 50 0 60 5 10 0 80 5 10 0 150 5 10 0 70 0 5 10 0 . 02 m M 0 . 2 m M 2 m M 6 m M 20 m M 200 m M 2 , 000 m M 6 , 000 m M a C o un t s Time ( ms ) b 0 20 5 10 60 m M 0 Time ( ms ) Figure 8 Dwells between main steps . a , Histograms of dwell times between two main ( 90 8 or 120 8 ) steps at various [ ATP ] .

Similar to F 1 - ATPase , myosin hosts ATP and its hydrolysis product at near equilibrium 29 , 30 . This may be the general tactics adopted by many ATP - dependent molecular machines . If so , much of the free - energy drop accompanying ATP hydrolysis occurs in the ATP - binding step 17 , 29 , 30 . ATP binding may be the principal source of power in these molecular machines . Indeed , ATP binding induces large conformational changes in molecules such as myosin 31 , kinesin 32 , 33 and chaperonin 34 . M Methods Proteins A mutant ( a - C193S , b - His 10 at amino terminus , g - S107C , g - I210C ) a 3 b 3 g subcomplex ( referred to here as F 1 ) derived from a thermophilic Bacillus PS3 was biotinylated at two cysteines ( g - 107C and g - 210C ) by incubation with fourfold molar excess of 6 - N 9 - [ 2 - ( N - maleimido ) ethyl ] - N - piperazinylamidohexyl - D - biotinamide for 1h at 23 8 C . Unbound biotin was removed with PD10 ( Amersham Pharmacia ) . Two biotin moieties per protein werefoundinanassayusing4 - hydroxyazobenzene - 2 - carboxylicacid 35 . Eightmolarexcess ofstreptavidin ( Pierce ) wasaddedtothebiotinylatedF 1 andpuriﬁedonSuperdex - 200HR ( Amersham Pharmacia ) . Beads Colloidal gold ( diameter 40nm ; British BioCell International ) was coated with biotiny - lated BSA by incubating 0 . 2 % colloidal gold in 2mM potassium phosphate pH7 . 0 with 0 . 4mgml - 1 BSA and 0 . 2mgml - 1 sulphosuccinimidyl - N - [ N 9 - ( D - biotinyl ) - 6 - aminohexa - noyl ] - 6 9 - aminohexanoate ( biotin - ( AC 5 ) 2 sulpho - OSu ; Dojin ) for 1h at 23 8 C . We stored modiﬁed gold particles in a solution containing 2mMpotassium phosphate and 0 . 05 % polyethylene glycol . Polystyrene beads were biotinylated as follows : 2 . 7 % amino beads ( 108nm ; Polyscience ) in 20mM potassium phosphate pH7 . 0 was incubated with 1mgml - 1 of biotin - ( AC 5 ) 2 sulpho - OSu for 1h at 23 8 C . We incubated 2 . 5 % of carboxy beads ( 196 or 291nm ; Bangs ) in 20mM potassium phosphate with 3 . 6mM 5 - ( ( ( N - ( biotinoyl ) amino ) hexanoyl ) amino ) pentylamine triﬂuoroacetate salt ( Molecular Probes ) , 1 % 1 - ethyl - 3 - ( 3 - dimethylaminopropyl ) - carbodiimide hydrochloride and 1 % N - hydro - xysulphosuccinimide for 1h at 23 8 C . Rate of ATP hydrolysis Nucleotide - depleted F 1 was prepared 18 , and its ATPase activity was determined at 23 8 C withanATP - regeneratingsystem 18 , 36 containing1mMphosphoenolpyruvate , 200 m gml - 1 pyruvate kinase , 100 m gml - 1 lactate dehydrogenase , 0 . 15mMNADH , and indicated MgATP in bufferA ( 50mMKCl , 2mMMgCl 2 , 10mM 3 - [ N - morpholino ] propane - sulfonic acid - KOH , pH7 . 0 ) . The initial hydrolysis rate was determined from the slope of absorbance decrease at 340nm ; the average slope was estimated for the period of 2 – 5s ( 2mM – 12 m MATP ) , 2 – 7s ( 6 – 2 m M ) or 2 – 12s ( 0 . 2 – 0 . 06 m M ) after the start of the reaction . In the presence of LDAO , hydrolysis kinetics showed a lag , and thus the rate was estimated at steady state during 400 – 500s ( 2mM – 60 m M ) , 1 , 000 – 1 , 500s ( 20 – 6 m M ) or 4 , 500 - 5 , 000s ( 2 – 0 . 6 m M ) . Microscopy Beads of 196nm and 291nm were observed with transmitted light on an Olympus IX - 70 microscope . We observed 40 - nm and 108 - nm beads with laser dark - ﬁeld microscopy 12 ( Fig . 1c ) . Alaserbeam ( 532nm , diameter3mm , 200mW ; MilleniaII , SpectraPhysics ) was introduced into a dark - ﬁeld condenser ( numerical aperture , NA 1 . 2 – 1 . 4 ; Olympus ) to illuminate the specimen obliquely . Light scattered by beads was collected with a · 100 objective ( NA1 . 35 ; Olympus ) with its iris diaphragm set to NA , 1 . 1 to block the direct ray . The ﬁeld of view was , 50 m m . To conﬁrm that we observed single 40 - nm beads and not their aggregates , we measured the intensity of beads with regular dark - ﬁeld micro - scopy with a halogen lamp , which provided homogeneous illumination . The intensity distribution had a single , large peak and a secondsmall peak at four times the intensityof theﬁrstpeak . Becauseanobjectsmallerthanthewavelengthscatterslightinproportionto thesquareofitsvolume 37 , thesepeaksshouldcorrespondtosingleandduplexbeads . Most beads were thus single . Twenty - fold reduction in the laser intensity did not affect the rotation speed , indicating that heating by the laser was insigniﬁcant . Bead rotation assay A ﬂowcellwasmadeoftwoKOH - cleanedcoverslipsseparated bytwospacerswith50 m m thickness 11 . Mixture of 0 . 1 – 1nM beads and F 1 at 10 – 100 times the bead concentration in buffer B ( buffer A plus 5mgml - 1 BSA ) was applied to the ﬂow cell . Unbound beads were washed out with buffer B , and then buffer B plus MgATP ( Mg 2 + 2mM in excess ) , 0 . 1mgml - 1 creatine kinase , and 1mMcreatine phosphate was infused . Bead images were recordedasaneight - bitAVIﬁlewithafastframingCCDcamera ( HiD - Cam , Nac ) at8 , 000 frames per s at [ ATP ] $ 2 m M ; 125frames per s at 0 . 2 m M ; and 60framess - 1 at 0 . 02 m M . The temperature was 23 8 C . From each unmodiﬁed image , the bead centroid was calculated as S x i ( I i - I th ) / S ( I i - I th ) , where x i ( or y i ) is the pixel coordinate , I i the pixel intensity , I th a threshold value , and the summation was for I I $ I th . The rotational frictional drag coefﬁcient y for the beads was calculated as follows : for a single bead of radius a rotating in water with viscosity h ( = 10 - 9 pN nm - 2 s ) , minimal y is given by 8 p h a 3 when the rotation axis is at the bead centre , and maximal y by 8 p h a 3 + 6 p h a 3 = 14 p h a 3 when the axis is at a bead edge ; for a bead duplex , minimal y is given by 2 · 8 p h a 3 = 16 p h a 3 for a vertical duplex rotating around its centre , whereas maximal y is 2 · 8 p h a 3 + 6 p h a 3 + 6 p h a ( 3 a ) 2 = 76 p h a 3 for a horizontal duplex rotating around an edge . Analysis of substep kinetics We superimposed and averaged time courses of individual steps as in Fig . 6a , b . First , we identiﬁed all main ( 90 8 or 120 8 ) steps in a continuous run by eye . Then , individual steps werealignedonthetimeaxisbypositioningthemidpointofeachstepattime0 ( towithin 6 oneframe ) . Verticalalignmentwasmadebyshift , bymultiplesof120 8 . Next , stepsother than the central one were eliminated from individual step records : the part earlier than 0 . 25ms after the preceding 90 8 substep ( or 120 8 stepwhen substeps werecontiguous ) was replacedwithahorizontallineat theangle atthe 0 . 25 - mspoint ( forexample , aredline in Fig . 6a ) , andthepartlaterthan0 . 25msbeforethefollowing90 8 substep ( or120 8 step ) was replacedwiththeangleatthatpoint ( Fig . 6a ; redline ) . Finally , weaveragedallsteprecords ( Fig . 6a , b ; thick cyan lines ) . Step records averaged over several runs ( Fig . 6c ; coloured lines ) were ﬁtted with theoreticalkinetics ( Fig . 6c ; greylines ) onthebasisoftheschemeinFig . 7a ; rateconstants in the scheme were ﬁxed to the values determined in Fig . 8 .

For the rise from 90 8 to 120 8 , two reactions with rates k 1 = 1 . 64 ms - 1 and k 2 = 0 . 71ms - 1 are assumed , giving A 30 8 (cid:215) B (cid:215) { 1 - (cid:137) k 2 exp (cid:133) 2 k 1 t (cid:134) 2 k 1 exp (cid:133) 2 k 2 t (cid:134)(cid:138) / ( k 2 - k 1 ) } + ( 120 8 - A 30 8 ) where B = exp ( - k ATPon [ ATP ] (cid:215) 0 . 25ms ) accounts for the loss of some of the30 8 substeps intheaveraging process . Global ﬁt to allexperimentalcurves ( allowing a vertical shift for each curve ) yielded A 30 8 = 29 . 8 6 0 . 3 8 . Received 4 October 2000 ; accepted 26 February 2001 . 1 . Boyer , P .
