This paper is focused on estimating the effects of a history of tobacco smoking and pre - existing co - morbidities on the severity of COVID - 19 infection among adult patients admitted into the aforesaid hospital . We con - ducted a retrospective data analysis of COVID - 19 adult patients hospitalized from August 27 , 2020 to April 20 , 2022 . Based on inclusion criteria ; a total of 788 admitted patients were included in the analysis . We conducted a Chi - squared test and Fisher’s exact test for the categorical variables to see their associations . Multinomial logistic regression models were performed to explore the risk factors for the severity of COVID - 19 infection . Among 788 patients , 18 . 4 % , 18 . 8 % , 13 % , 7 . 1 % , 3 . 4 % , and 1 . 9 % have had a history of smoking , hyper - tension , diabetes , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , cardiovascular diseases ( CVD ) , and asthma respectively . Overall , the mean age of the patients was 40 . 3 ± 16 . 4 years and 51 % were female . In multivariate analysis , history of smoking and co - morbidities were identified as the risk factors for the severity of COVID - 19 infection ; the history of smok - ing was found linked with an increase in the risk of developing critical , severe , and moderate level of COVID - 19 infection - notably 3 . 17 times ( RRR = 3 . 17 ; 95 % CI : 1 . 3 – 7 . 68 ) , 2 . 98 times ( RRR = 2 . 98 ; 95 % CI : 1 . 87 – 4 . 76 ) and 1 . 96 times ( RRR = 1 . 96 ; 95 % CI : 1 . 25 – 3 . 08 ) respec - tively more than the patients who never smoked . It was evident that patients with at least one of the selected co - morbidities such as hypertension , diabetes , COPD , CVD , and asthma exhibited a significantly higher likelihood of experiencing severe illness of COVID - 19 compared to patients without any co - morbidity . History of tobacco smoking and pre - exist - ing co - morbidities were significantly associated with an increased severity of COVID - 19 infection .

Background The pandemic COVID - 19 ( Coronavirus Disease , 2019 ) was first detected in Wuhan province of China in early December 2019 [ 1 ] . It is a highly infectious , rapidly transmissible and fatal disease caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) [ 2 ] . Globally , it infected over 587 million people , including 6 . 44 million deaths till August 10 , 2022 [ 3 ] . COVID - 19 outbreak was declared a Public Health Emergency of Global Concern on January 30 , 2020 , and a pandemic on March 11 , 2020 , by the World Health Organization ( WHO ) [ 1 ] . In Bangladesh , the first 3 COVID - 19 cases were detected in March 2020 [ 4 ] and more than 2 . 0 million COVID - 19 cases were identified , including about 29 , 300 deaths till August 10 , 2022 [ 5 ] . Literature review Globally , several studies have been conducted to identify the factors associated with COVID - 19 disease severity , with most of the studies focusing on a limited number of conditions ( i . e . , comorbidities ) including smoking status [ 5 – 8 ] . Approximately 20 % of adults worldwide smoke tobacco , which is recognized as a significant risk factor for respiratory diseases [ 6 , 9 ] and smokers have a 34 % greater risk of contracting the common flu than among non - smokers [ 10 ] . Also , smoking leads to inflammation of the pulmonary epithelium causing cytokines release , increased mucous secretion , and impaired mucociliary clearance [ 11 , 12 ] . The preva - lence of tobacco use in Bangladesh is significant , with nearly 35 % of adults primarily smoking tobacco currently [ 13 ] . Since 2004 , this lower middle - income country has witnessed a dra - matic increase in the health and economic burden linked to smoking or smokeless tobacco use , as evidenced by primary data from a nationally representative survey of patients with tobacco - related illnesses , where tobacco smoking significantly contributes to non - communica - ble diseases ( NCDs ) , including cardiovascular and respiratory conditions , underscoring the imperative to address tobacco control measures to mitigate its impact on both public health and economic growth [ 14 ] . Several studies have found mixed results in regard to the association between smoking and the severity of COVID - 19 disease [ 5 , 7 ] . An analysis of a systematic review and meta - analysis indicated that current and former smokers are more likely to present with severe COVID - 19 conditions as compared with non - smokers [ 15 ] , while another study reported that the severity of COVID - 19 illness was not associated with smoking [ 7 ] . Additionally , smoking tobacco is strongly linked to the development of co - morbidities such as hypertension , cardiovascular dis - ease ( CVD ) , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , and asthma , which may worsen the outcome of COVID - 19 disease [ 7 , 17 ] . Hypertension is one of the most common and frequent co - morbidities which may contrib - ute to the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome in patients with COVID - 19 pos - itivity [ 16 ] . Various findings have been reported regarding the association between the comorbidity of hypertension and the severity of COVID - 19 [ 17 – 19 ] . According to a retrospec - tive cohort study , hypertension was not an independent risk factor but was linked to diabetes and cardiovascular disease [ 20 ] . Diabetes , another common comorbidity , has been identified as a significant public health issue in Bangladesh and affects approximately one in ten adults [ 21 ] . A study found that dia - betic patients with COVID - 19 had a more severe condition and poorer clinical outcomes , as well as a higher mortality rate and increased ICU admissions , highlighting the need for improved management strategies in order to improve their prognosis [ 22 – 24 ] . Nevertheless , a PLOS ONE Smokingand pre - existing co - morbiditiesas risk factors for developing severity of COVID - 19 infection PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0295040 December8 , 2023 2 / 14 Funding : The author ( s ) receivedno specific fundingfor this work . Competinginterests : The authorshave declared that no competinginterestsexist . study conducted in China with a limited sample size did not find diabetes to be associated with severe COVID - 19 [ 25 ] . Globally , approximately 200 million people suffer from COPD , and 3 . 2 million people die from COPD every year , making it the third leading cause of death among adults [ 26 ] , and cur - rently , 12 . 5 % of Bangladeshi adults have COPD [ 27 ] . People with chronic obstructive pulmo - nary disease can suffer from acute deterioration of their health status due to respiratory viruses , and since the start of the COVID - 19 pandemic , they have faced additional challenges [ 28 ] . Several studies have demonstrated that patients with underlying COPD are more likely to experience severe COVID - 19 outcomes ( e . g . , hospitalization , severe disease , and ICU admis - sion ) [ 6 , 29 ] . However , a study conducted on symptomatic patients found that COPD and asthma alone did not lead to worsening infections , hospitalizations , or deaths associated with COVID - 19 [ 30 ] . Similarly , a study found cases with CVD and asthma show a significantly ele - vated risk of increasing severity of COVID - 19 [ 31 ] . Despite several studies in many countries , to date , only one study has been found in Bangla - desh which focused on the association between the smoking habit and the severity of COVID - 19 infection but did not consider any specific co - morbidities [ 5 ] . To address this evidence gap ; our objective was to estimate the effects of a history of smoking , either cigarettes or other tobacco products and pre - existing co - morbidities on the severity of COVID - 19 infection in a rural setting of Bangladesh . Materials and methods The study setting The hospital , initiated as part of COVID - 19 outbreak management in Teknaf , began opera - tions on August 27 , 2020 , and it is still actively providing services to the local population and Forcibly Displaced Myanmar Nationals ( FDMN ) as a not - for - profit organization . Out of total 95 beds ; initially , 80 beds of this field hospital were dedicated to COVID - 19 patients inclusive of a 10 - bed High Dependency Unit ( HDU ) with central oxygen , concentrator , and cylinder oxygen supply . Besides ; 24 / 7 Emergency , Out - Patient Department , radiology , laboratory ser - vices , and referral by ambulance to higher level facilities in Cox’s Bazar district remain avail - able free of charge . Necessary medicines , high flow nasal cannula , pulse oximeter , PPE , masks , hand sanitizer , and other necessary medical appliances were adequately supplied by the donor . A large contingent of trained medical doctors , nurses , patient care attendants , medical tech - nologists , infection prevention and control ( IPC ) workers , and biomedical engineers were deployed by the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research , Bangladesh ( icddr , b ) to run the facility effectively . An uninterrupted supply of power and safe water was ensured in the hospital . However ; the physical structure of the hospital was made of bamboo huts with concrete floors . Study design and data source We conducted a retrospective analysis of the data collected from COVID - 19 positive adult patients who were hospitalized at Teknaf field hospital . Upon initial contact , the physician used a standardized Case Record Form ( CRF ) to record the patient’s background characteris - tics , medical history , smoking history ( current or past smoker ) , co - morbidity , the severity of illness and underlying co - morbidities . A skilled data management team maintains and updates the hospital’s online database system named " ONA " to accommodate the collection of patient information . We extracted data from COVID - 19 patients treated between August 27 , 2020 and April 20 , 2022 ( in . CSV format ) . There were 961 patients admitted to the study hospital PLOS ONE Smokingand pre - existing co - morbiditiesas risk factors for developing severity of COVID - 19 infection PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0295040 December8 , 2023 3 / 14 during this period who were diagnosed as positive for COVID - 19 by both nasal and oropha - ryngeal swabs in Real - Time Polymerase Chain Reaction ( RT - PCR ) . Because this study focused on adult patients ( aged 18 years or older or older ) , 173 patients under the age of 18 were excluded from this analysis . We chose to categorize patients as " adults " ( 18 – 60 years ) and " elderly " ( > 60 years ) [ 32 ] due to the observed significant association between these age groups and the severity of COVID - 19 infection in the pilot analysis . There - fore , finally , 788 COVID - 19 patients were included in this analysis . COPD , hypertension , car - diovascular disease , and diabetes were diagnosed based on patients’ history , clinical features and radiological and laboratory findings . For this study , the current and past smokers were grouped as ‘ever - smoker’ . The severity of COVID - 19 infection The severity of COVID - 19 infection was determined based on WHO standards [ 33 ] . The severity levels of COVID - 19 infection ( only for adult patients ) are explained as , • Mild type : Clinical symptoms ( e . g . , fever , cough , fatigue , anorexia , shore throat , nasal con - gestion , headache , diarrhea , nausea and vomiting , dizziness , weakness ) are present , without evidence of viral pneumonia or hypoxia ( Hypoxia : New - onset oxygen saturation of � 94 . 0 % ) . • Moderate type : clinical signs of pneumonia ( fever , cough , dyspnea , fast breathing ) and other non - specific symptoms ( sore throat , nasal congestion , headache , diarrhea , nausea , and vom - iting ) are present but no signs of severe pneumonia , including SpO 2 � 90 % on room air . • Severe type : Patients with at least one of the following : SpO 2 < 90 % on room air ; Severe pneumonia ; signs of severe respiratory distress ( in adults , accessory muscle use , inability to complete full sentences , respiratory rate > 30 breaths / min ; ) ; • Critical type : Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ( ARDS ) , sepsis , septic shock is present , and the need for invasive or non - invasive mechanical ventilation or vasopressor therapy . During the course of treatment , the duty physician assigned everyone included in this study a severity level based on the above definition . It was used in the analysis as a dependent variable . It is important to note that in this study , both cigarette smoking and other tobacco product use were considered as part of smoking , encompassing a broad spectrum of tobacco consump - tion habits . Statistical analysis The data was analyzed using STATA 16 . 0 ( StataCorp LLC ) statistical package and descriptive statistics were used to determine the frequency and percentage of background , characteristics , severity levels of COVID - 19 infection , pre - existing comorbidities , and smoking history . To assess the association between main variables of interest ( e . g . , history of smoking , underlying co - morbidities ) and severity of COVID - 19 infection , Pearson’s Chi - square test and Fisher’s exact test are used . Multinomial logistic regression models [ 34 ] were used to identify potential risk factors and determine the effect size of these factors on the progression of COVID - 19 infection severity in the patients . To measure statistical significance , a P - value of 0 . 05 was considered . The MNL model is described below : There are k categorical outcomes ( e . g . , mild , moderate , severe , and critical ) and—without loss of generality—let the base outcome be 1 .

The following Eq ( 2 ) was estimated to examine the relationship between the severity of COVID - 19 infection and the history of smoking with control variables such as age , sex , hypertension , diabetes , COPD , CVD , and asthma . To assess the goodness - of - fit of the model , we used the likelihood ratio chi - square test , and the McFad - den’s pseudo - R - squared . Ethical clearance The Ethical Review Committee ( ERC ) of the International Center for Diarrheal Disease Research , Bangladesh , waived the requirement for Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) review since all data is de - identified and no personal information will be disclosed . The participants gave verbal consent for their information to be used for further research since they did not intend to sign any documents or leave fingerprints , and many of them were analphabetic . Fur - thermore , no minors were included in this study , hence parent or guardian consent was not required . Results Patient characteristics A total of 788 COVID - 19 positive hospitalized patients were studied , of which 3 . 4 % were critical , 20 . 6 % were severe , 29 . 4 % were moderate and 46 . 6 % were mild . Overall , the mean age of the patients was 40 . 3 ± 16 . 4 years and 13 . 0 % of patients were aged above 60 years . The majority of patients were female , with 51 . 0 % being female , and 18 . 4 % being ever - smokers . Based on the selected co - morbidities , 18 . 8 % of patients had hypertension , 13 . 0 % had diabe - tes , 7 . 1 % had COPD , 3 . 4 % had cardiovascular disease , and 1 . 9 % had asthma as shown in Table 1 . Severity of COVID - 19 infection and patient’s characteristics Table 2 presents bivariate associations between the severity of the COVID - 19 infection and the characteristics of the patients . There was a significant association ( P < 0 . 05 ) between the age and smoking history of the patients and COVID - 19 infection . The percentage of severely COVID - 19 infection was higher among the elderly patients ( 60 and older ) , compared to rela - tively younger adults . The proportions of patient with moderate , severe , and critical COVID - 19 infection were higher among ever - smoker in comparison to non - smoker .

The unadjusted model indicated that ever - smoker COVID - 19 patients suffered 3 . 17 ( RRR = 3 . 17 ; 95 % CI : 1 . 3 – 7 . 68 ) times more critical stages of the COVID - 19 disease sever - ity in comparison with non - smoker COVID - 19 patients . Compared to non - smoker , the same group of patients suffered 1 . 96 ( RRR = 1 . 96 ; 95 % CI : 1 . 25 – 3 . 08 ) times more moderate and 2 . 98 ( RRR = 2 . 98 ; 95 % CI : 1 . 87 – 4 . 76 ) times more severe COVID - 19 infections . Similarly , co - mor - bidities were identified as risk factors for critical , severe , and moderate severity levels of COVID - 19 infection in the separate unadjusted models . As potential risk factors , the following variables were incorporated into the final model ( adjusted model ) : smoking history , hypertension , diabetes , COPD , CVD , asthma , gender , and age ( > 60 years old—elderly ) . In the adjusted model , while smoking history was recognized as a risk factor contributing to the severity of COVID - 19 infection , it was not associated with mod - erate and critical levels of severity . Hypertensive patients were 4 . 75 times more proneto experi - ence critical severity of COVID - 19 infection ( RRR = 4 . 76 ; 95 % CI : 1 . 47 – 15 . 04 ) compared to non - hypertensive patients . In addition , hypertensive patients were 8 . 51 times more vulnerable to develop severe infections ( RR = 8 . 51 ; 95 % CI : 3 . 80 – 19 . 08 ) and 9 . 13 times more vulnerable to suffering moderate infections ( RR = 9 . 13 ; 95 % CI : 4 . 25 – 19 . 59 ) compared to those without hypertension . Similarly , patients with diabetes had 42 . 29 times higher risk of developing critical COVID - 19 infections ( RRR = 42 . 29 ; 95 % CI : 10 . 65 – 167 . 93 ) , 16 . 2 times higher risk of severe infections ( RRR = 16 . 2 ; 95 % CI : 5 . 39 – 48 . 96 ) , and 13 . 19 times higher risk of moderate infections ( RRR = 13 . 19 ; 95 % CI : 4 . 5 – 38 . 69 ) compared to patients without diabetes . Patients with COPD were 36 . 55 times susceptible to experience critical COVID - 19 infection ( RRR = 36 . 55 ; 95 % CI : 6 . 45 – 207 . 1 ) , 18 . 78 times susceptible to have severe infections ( RRR = 18 . 78 ; 95 % CI : 4 . 12 – 85 . 48 ) , and 8 . 45 times susceptible to have moderate infections ( RRR = 8 . 45 ; 95 % CI : 1 . 82 – 39 . 13 ) when compared with non - COPD patients . Considering asthma , patients with this condi - tion were over 8 times risk of having worse COVID - 19 infection conditions of moderate to severe . As a result of the limited number of asthmatic participants in the study ( n = 15 ) , no asso - ciation was established between pre - existing asthma and the development of critical stages of COVID - 19 infection . Lastly , elderly patients ( > 60 years ) had 42 . 83 times critical COVID - 19 infection ( RRR = 42 . 83 ; 95 % CI : 13 . 2 – 138 . 9 ) , had12 . 35 times severe infections ( RRR = 12 . 35 ; Table 3 .

Age was also identified as a significant factor in determining the severity of COVID - 19 infection . Multiple factors were investigated that contributed to the severity of COVID - 19 infection independently and cumulatively . The prevalence of ever - smoker among the studied patients was approximately eighteen percent , with both females and males being ever - smoker , though the prevalence was not examined separately . Additionally , a subset of patients ( 30 . 6 % ) presented with at least one of the selected underlying co - morbidities . The study revealed a significant association between a history of smoking and the severity of COVID - 19 infection where patients with smoking habits were at a greater risk of developing severe , and critical stages of COVID - 19 infection than patients who did not smoke . This find - ing was supported by a meta - analysis which found that current or former smokers had a sig - nificantly higher chance of developing severe or critical cases of COVID - 19 infection . Another study conducted in Dhaka , Bangladesh showed that people who had actively smoked for a long time were more likely to develop severe and critical COVID - 19 [ 5 ] . Additionally , there is evidence that smokers have a greater risk of poor outcomes from COVID - 19 , such as hospitali - zation and progression to severe disease [ 35 ] . The effects of smoking may be attributed to the significant changes in cytokines that can affect systemic immunity and inflammation [ 36 ] since cytokines play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of COVID - 19 [ 37 ] . Furthermore , smok - ers are vulnerable to get common cold and respiratory viral diseases [ 11 ] . Lippi G and Henry BM , however , found that smoking did not contribute to the severity of COVID - 19 illness in their study [ 7 ] . Although a retrospective cohort study found that , hypertension was not an independent risk factor for COVID - 19 severity [ 20 ] . However , current study found that hypertension is sig - nificantly associated with the severity of COVID - 19 infection . Even after adjusting for other factors , it was identified as a potential risk factor attributable to moderate , severe , and critical stages of COVID - 19 infection . This finding is consistent with another systematic review and meta - analysis findings which revealed that hypertension was associated with an increased composite poor outcome ( risk ratio ( RR ) 2 . 11 ) and its subgroups , including mortality , severe COVID - 19 , ARDS , intensive care , and disease progression [ 38 ] . Moreover , another systematic review identified hypertension as the most prevalent comorbidity in COVID - 19 patients which noticeably increases the risk of hospitalization and death [ 39 ] . Likewise , diabetes and asthma were also found to be risk factors for COVID - 19 infection severity in the current study , with the adjusted odds of severe infection being higher among those with diabetes and asthma . There was , however , no significant association between diabe - tes and severe COVID - 19 outcomes in a study conducted in China with a limited sample size [ 25 ] . This study’s findings , however , may not be easily generalizable to wider populations or contexts due to the limitations of its sample size . The current study also found diabetes , and asthma as risk factors for the severity of COVID - 19 infection . Similarly , a study conducted in the United States of America found that diabetes and asthma are associated with an increased severity of COVID - 19 infection [ 31 ] . Additionally , asthma has been identified as a potential comorbid condition associated with severe illness of COVID - 19 [ 34 ] by the Centers for Dis - ease Control and Prevention [ 40 ] . Although univariate analysis found that two - thirds of the patients with cardiovascular dis - eases were severely ill and 11 % were critically ill , the multivariate analysis adjusted with covari - ates found CVD to be insignificant as an independent predictor of COVID - 19 infection severity . Kunihiro et al similarly , found that CVD was independently associated with COVID - 19 severity [ 19 ] . The presence of underlying COPD among 75 percent of patient was significantly associated with a greater risk of developing severe infection with COVID - 19 . Multivariate analysis after adjusting for the covariates such as age , gender , smoking history , hypertension , diabetes , PLOS ONE Smokingand pre - existing co - morbiditiesas risk factors for developing severity of COVID - 19 infection PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0295040 December8 , 2023 9 / 14 CVD , and asthma revealed that this association persisted , indicating COVID - 19 patients with COPD had worse conditions than those without COPD . As highlighted in a narrative review of the basic science and clinical outcomes of COVID - 19 , COPD is associated with an increased risk of severe illness independently [ 41 ] . Moreover , a study examined the distinct effects of asthma and COPD on the progression and outcomes of COVID - 19 patients and found that patients suffering from COPD were 23 times more likely to develop severe illness than patients without COPD [ 42 ] . Nevertheless , a study conducted on symptomatic patients found that COPD and asthma alone did not worsen infections , hospitalizations , or deaths associated with COVID - 19 [ 30 ] . Patients’ age was identified as a significant risk factor associated with hospitalization for COVID - 19 critical illness . Elderly patients , particularly those aged 60 years and older , had an increased risk of severe COVID - 19 - associated outcomes . This finding aligned with the data reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention which found that elderly patients with COVID - 19 infection were more likely to suffer severe COVID - 19 - associated outcomes [ 40 ] . Nevertheless , future large - scale research is warranted to address the lack of conclusive estimation of severe rates , thereby enhancing our understanding of COVID - 19 severity and elderly age [ 43 ] . The prevalence of undiagnosed hypertension , diabetes , and COPD is high - burden in Ban - gladesh [ 44 – 46 ] , and a majority of the population is unaware of these diseases and their conse - quences . Based on the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey ( BDHS ) , 50 % of hypertensive women and 66 % of hypertensive men are unaware of their high blood pressure , and 60 % of diabetic patients are unaware of their elevated blood glucose levels among adults ( aged 18 and older ) [ 47 ] . During the course of this study , we gained insight into the local peo - ple’s lifestyle , attitudes , and responses to diseases , as well as the environmental factors that con - tribute to disease . In Teknaf , the prevalence of smoking and undiagnosed non - communicable diseases ( NCDs ) is particularly high , especially among respiratory patients . While the patients in our study were tested for these co - morbidities during their hospital stay , there is a possibility that some patients may not have been aware of their pre - existing conditions . This particularly applies to first - time patients , like the Forcibly Displaced Myanmar Nationals ( FDMN ) refu - gees , who might lack prior medical records . Strength of the study The main strength of this study is the use of existing dataset which covers all the three waves of COVID - 19 surges in a remote rural setting of Bangladesh . All the stages of severity of COVID - 19 infection were well diagnosed by the trained physicians according to the pre - established standard definitions set by the National Guidelines on COVID - 19 Management . Therefore , the dataset was well representative of the defined severity of COVID - 19 infection in Bangladesh . Study limitations The vaccination uptake and its potential impact on moderating the severity of COVID - 19 infection were not considered in the analysis . Also , the clinical team did not perform spirome - try to diagnose COPD . However , physicians diagnosed the patients by clinical examination and X - ray chest in the hospital . Study patients were unwilling to share their monthly income and occupation for which this study could not capture their socio - economic status . Further - more , while we examined the individual effects of sex and smoking on the severity of COVID - 19 infection , we did not conduct a specific analysis to explore potential interaction effects between these factors that could influence the development of severe COVID - 19 .

Among the covariates of COVID - 19 infection severity , the age of patients also contributes to worsening the severity sta - tus . Policymakers , public health activists , and clinical practitioners need to take advantage of these findings to plan interventions that can contribute to improving the preventive strategy for reducing the above - mentioned risk factors and the management of those risk factors in clinical settings . Also , it is recommended that public health initiatives prioritize extensive smoking cessation programs and awareness campaigns aimed at reducing smoking rates , par - ticularly among individuals with pre - existing health conditions . Additionally , enhancing diag - nostic infrastructure for those with comorbidities can aid in the timely identification of their health issues . . Furthermore , efforts should be made to enhance the early detection and man - agement of hypertension , diabetes , COPD , and asthma in the community to mitigate the severity of COVID - 19 infections and improve overall health outcomes .
