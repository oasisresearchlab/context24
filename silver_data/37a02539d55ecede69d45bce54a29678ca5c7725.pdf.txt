Bynegative - stainingEM , dynamin 1 – cortactin complexes appeared as “open” or “closed” rings depending on guanine nucleotide conditions . By pyrene actin assembly assay , dynamin 1 stimulated actin assembly in mouse brain cytosol . In vitro incubation of F - actin with both dynamin 1 and cortactin led to the formation of long and thick actin bundles , on which dynamin 1 and cortactin were periodically colocalized in puncta . A depoly - merizationassayrevealedthatdynamin1andcortactinincreasedthestabilityofactinbundles , mostprominentlyinthepresenceofGTP . In rat cortical neurons and human neuroblastoma cell line , SH - SY5Y , both dynamin 1 and cortactin localized on actin filaments and the bundles at growth cone filopodia as revealed by immunoelectron microscopy . In SH - SY5Y cell , acute inhibition of dynamin 1 by appli - cation of dynamin inhibitor led to growth cone collapse . Cortactin knockdown also reduced growth cone filopodia . Together , our results strongly suggest that dynamin 1 and cortactin ring complex mechanically stabilizes F - actin bundles in growth cone filopodia . Thus , the GTPase - dependent mechanochemical enzyme property of dynamin is commonly used both in endocytosis and regulation of F - actin bundles by a dynamin 1 – cortactin complex . Introduction Dynamin 1 , a neuronal isoform of dynamin , has primarily been studied as a key molecule involved in clathrin - mediated endocy - tosis of synaptic vesicles . Dynamin 1 assembles into a helical ring at the neck of endocytic pits ( Takei et al . , 1995 ) , and the confor - mational changes of these polymerized dynamin upon GTP hy - drolysis provides the mechanical force to sever the endocytic pit ( Sweitzer and Hinshaw , 1998 ; Takei et al . , 1998 ; Marks et al . , 2001 ; Roux et al . , 2006 ; Ramachandran and Schmid , 2008 ) . Dynamin’s function as a mechanochemical enzyme in mem - brane fission is strongly supported by the recently revealed crystal structure of dynamin 1 ( dynamin (cid:1) PRD ) comprised of the GTPase domain , the bundle signaling element ( BSE ) , and the stalk and the pleckstrin homology ( PH ) domain ( Faelber et al . , 2011 ; Ford et al . , 2011 ) . The stalk is responsible for dimerization of dynamin in a criss - cross fashion , and for interaction with the PH domain and BSE of the neighboring dynamin molecule in a polymerized helix . In addition , dynamin 1 has a proline / arginine - rich domain ( PRD ) at the C terminus that interacts with various SH3 domain - containing synaptic endocytic proteins , in - cluding amphiphysin 1 ( David et al . , 1996 ; Takei et al . , 1999 ; Yoshida et al . , 2004 ) , endophilin ( Farsad et al . , 2001 ) , sorting nexin 9 ( Ramachandran and Schmid , 2008 ) , syndapin ( Kessels and Qualmann , 2004 ) , and intersectin ( Yamabhai et al . , 1998 ) . Cortactin , an F - actin - binding protein , binds to the ubiqui - tously expressed dynamin 2 ( McNiven et al . , 2000 ) . Cortactin has an N - terminal acidic domain that binds to Arp2 / 3 complexes , F - actin - binding “cortactin repeats , ” and a C - terminal SH3 do - main . Thus , dynamin2isthoughttobeinvolvedintheregulation oftheactincytoskeleton ( Schaferetal . , 2002 ; Caoetal . , 2003 ; Zhu et al . , 2005 ; Mooren et al . , 2009 ; Yamada et al . , 2009a ) . Several studies implicate dynamin’s GTPase activity in the regulation of actin dynamics , including remodeling of actin filaments ( Moo - ren et al . , 2009 ) , actin comet formation ( Lee and De Camilli , 2002 ; Orth et al . , 2002 ) or podosomes ( Ochoa et al . , 2000 ; Bruz - zaniti et al . , 2005 ) , and maintenance of cell shape ( Damke et al . , 1994 ) . It is currently unknown whether dynamin functions as a GTP - driven mechanochemical enzyme in actin regulation . ReceivedJune6 , 2012 ; revisedDec . 11 , 2012 ; acceptedDec . 18 , 2012 .

DOI : 10 . 1523 / JNEUROSCI . 2762 - 12 . 2013 Copyright©2013theauthors 0270 - 6474 / 13 / 334514 - 13 $ 15 . 00 / 0 4514 • TheJournalofNeuroscience , March6 , 2013 • 33 ( 10 ) : 4514 – 4526 Actin is enriched in growth cones that are implicated in axon guidance . Growth cone are stabilized when they encounter at - tractive guidance molecules , and they retract upon contact with repellent guidance molecules ( Dent and Gertler , 2003 ; Geraldo and Gordon - Weeks , 2009 ; Lowery and Van Vactor , 2009 ) . Growth cone is spread by radially arranged filopodia , which are supported by actin bundles ( Lewis and Bridgman , 1992 ) , and the stability of the actin bundles is crucial for the growth cone mor - phology . Although F - actin cross - linking proteins , including (cid:1) - actinin or Fascin , are thought to stabilize the F - actin bundles ( Courson and Rock , 2010 ) , precise mechanisms are hardly unknown . In this study , we demonstrate that dynamin 1 and cortactin form ring - shaped complexes , and the rings grab the F - actin bun - dles using dynamin’s mechanochemical properties and stabilize the bundles . This mechanism is implicated in the formation of growth cone filopodia , and essential for the stabilization of growth cones . Materials and Methods Antibodies and reagents .

Alexa Fluor 488 - conjugated anti - rabbit IgG , Rhodamine - conjugated anti - mouse IgG , and Rhodamine - and Alexa Fluor 488 - labeled phalloi - din were all purchased from Life Technologies . Goat anti - mouse IgG - and goat anti - rabbit IgG - conjugated gold particles were purchased from British BioCell International . Rabbit (cid:1) - actinin was purchased from Cytoskeleton Inc . Cell culture . Cortical neurons from postnatal day 0 ( P0 ) – P2 mouse brains of either sex were cultured for 4 – 6 d , as described previously ( Hayashi et al . , 2008 ) . SH - SY5Y ( CRL - 2266 , ATCC ) and NG108 - 15 ( HB - 12317 , ATCC ) cells were cultured in DMEM with 10 % FBS at 37°C under 5 % CO 2 and were differentiated with 10 (cid:3) M retinoic acid or 1 m M dibutyryl cAMP , respectively , 2 – 3 d before experiments . Poly - D - lysine was used as a coating substrate for cortical neurons and NG108 - 15 cells , while fibronectin was used for SH - SY5Y cells . Purification of recombinant proteins . A point mutation for dynamin 1 K44A was introduced into WT human dynamin 1 using the QuikChange Site - Directed Mutagenesis Kit ( Agilent Technologies ) . His - tagged dy - namin 1 or dynamin 1 K44A was expressed using the Bac - to - Bac bacu - lovirus expression system ( Life Technologies ) and purified as described previously ( Warnock et al . , 1997 ) . The purified dynamin solutions were concentrated using Centriplus YM50 ( Millipore ) . By reversed phase HPLC analysis , it was confirmed that (cid:2) 98 % of the purified dynamin 1 was guanine nucleotide free form . Rat dynamin 2 cDNA in baculovirus was a kind gift provided by Prof . Handa ( Tokyo Institute of Technology , Tokyo , Japan ) , andtherecombinantproteinwaspurifiedasdescribedfor dynamin 1 above . The cDNA encoding rat full - length cortactin ( Cort WT ) and the cor - tactin deletion mutants [ 1 - 80 aa , 1 - 450 aa ( Cort (cid:1) SH3 ) , 284 - 450 aa and 451 - 509 aa ( Cort SH3 ) ] were prepared by PCR ( McNiven et al . , 2000 ) and subcloned into the plasmid pGEX - 6P vector following digestion with BamH1 - EcoR1 . GST - tagged cortactin W525K ( Cort W525K ) was generated by mutation of pGEX - 6p - cortactin using the QuikChange Site - Directed Mutagenesis Kit ( Agilent Technologies ) ( Schafer et al . , 2002 ) . Forexpressionincells , CortWTorCort (cid:1) SH3wassubclonedinto the pEF1 myc - His vector ( Life Technologies ) as EcoR1 - Xba1 fragments . Cort WT or Cort W525K was subcloned into pIRES2 - AcGFP1 expres - sion vector ( Clontech ) as EcoR1 - BamH1 fragments . The resulting plas - mid was transformed into bacterial BL21 ( DE3 ) pLysS strain for protein expression . The expression of GST - fusion proteins was induced by 0 . 1 m M isopropyl - 1 - thio - D - galactopyranoside at 37°C for 3 – 6 h in LB media supplemented with 100 (cid:3) g / ml ampicillin at A 600 (cid:3) 0 . 8 . GST - fusion proteins were then purified as described previously ( Slepnev et al . , 2000 ) . The GST was cleaved using a PreScission protease ( GE Healthcare ) accord - ing to the manufacturer’s instructions , and purified on Mono Q columns equilibrated in 20 m M Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 7 , and 0 . 2 M NaCl . The nucleotide sequences of the constructs used in this study were verified with DNA se - quence analysis . All of the purified protein solutions ( 2 – 5 mg / ml ) were stored at (cid:4) 80°C and thawed at 37°C before use . Preparation of brain cytosol . Brain cytosol was prepared as described pre - viously with slight modifications ( Yamada et al . , 2009b ) . Briefly , 20 male mouse brains were homogenized in 5 ml of buffer ( XB : 10 m M HEPES , pH 7 . 4 , 100 m M KCl , 2 m M MgCl 2 , 0 . 1 m M CaCl 2 , 5 m M EGTA , 50 m M sucrose , 1 m M DTT , leupeptin at 1 (cid:3) g / ml , pepstatin at 5 (cid:3) g / ml , and PMSF at 0 . 4 mg / ml ) . The homogenate was centrifuged at 3000 (cid:5) g for 20 min and then 10 , 000 (cid:5) g for 20 min . The resultant supernatant was diluted with XB four - fold and centrifuged at 400 , 000 (cid:5) g for 1 h . The clear supernatant was care - fully collected and concentrated to one - fourth of the volume using Centriprep - 10 concentrators ( Millipore ) . The prepared cytosol ( 40 – 50 mg / ml ) was supplemented with an ATP generating system ( 1 m M ATP , 8 m M creatine phosphate , 8 U / ml phosphocreatine kinase , 1 m M MgCl 2 , 200 m M sucrose ) and stored at (cid:4) 80°C . In vitro actin assembly and disassembly assays . Actin assembly was quantified using pyrene - actin ( Yamada et al . , 2009b ) . Briefly , 12 mg / ml brain cytosol and 9 . 4 (cid:3) M pyrene - actin ( Cytoskeleton Inc . ) in Assay buffer ( 20 m M HEPES , pH 7 . 4 , 100 m M KCl , 1 m M MgCl 2 , 0 . 1 m M EDTA , 1 m M DTT , and 0 . 1 m M EGTA ) was preincubated with an ATP regenerating system in a quartz cuvette for 10 min at room tempera - ture . Then , 120 (cid:3) M small unilamellar liposomes consisting of 50 % phosphatidylserine ( PS ) and 50 % phosphatidylcholine were added . Pyrene fluorescence at 407 nm ( 10 nm slit width ) with excitation at 365 nm was then measured using an F - 2500 fluorescence spectropho - tometer ( Hitachi Ltd . ) . Actin disassembly was quantitatively analyzed as described previously ( Okamoto et al . , 2007 ) . F - actin was formed from 4 . 7 (cid:3) M pyrene - actin at room temperature for 30 min in F - buffer ( 0 . 2 m M CaCl 2 , 50 m M KCl , 2 m M MgCl 2 , and 1 m M ATP in 5 m M Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 5 ) . F - actin was then depolymerized by diluting at 1 : 10 with F - buffer in the absence or pres - ence of 5 (cid:3) M each of dynamin 1 and cortactin under the indicated gua - nine nucleotide conditions . To assess the effect of an actin depolymerization toxin on F - actin disassembly , 2 (cid:3) M Mycalolide B di - luted with G - buffer ( 0 . 2 m M CaCl 2 in 5 m M Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 ) was added to the preformed F - actin . Pyrene fluorescence was detected with a fluo - rescent microplate reader ( MTP - 600F , Corona Electric Co . Ltd . , Japan ) . All steps were done at room temperature . siRNA - mediated dynamin 1 or cortactin knockdown . Pre - annealed siRNA designed using sequences for human dynamin 1 or cortactin were synthesized and purified by Life Technologies . The target sequence for dynamin 1 was 5 (cid:6) - GCACUGCAAGGGAAAGAAAtt - 3 (cid:6) . The target sequences for cortactin were 5 (cid:6) - CCGAAUGGAUAAGUCA GUCtt - 3 (cid:6) for oligo 1 ; 5 (cid:6) - GGUUUCGGCGGCAAAUACGtt - 3 (cid:6) for oligo2 ; 5 (cid:6) - CGAAUAUCAGUCGAAACUUtt - 3 (cid:6) for oligo 3 . Scrambled RNA that has no significant sequence homology to mouse , rat , or human gene sequences was also purchased to use as a negative control . One day before transfection , cells were plated in six - well plates ( 5 . 0 (cid:5) 10 4 cells / well ) . DuplexsiRNA ( 100pmol ) wastransfectedintothe cells using 4 (cid:3) l of Lipofectamine RNAiMax ( Life Technologies ) . After 72 h , the cells were used for experiments . Three different siRNAs for cortactin were effective and yielded the same results . For rescue experi - ments , SH - SY5Y cells were first treated with Oligo 3 for cortactin knock - down , and cultured for 24 h . Cells ( 1 (cid:5) 10 5 / coverslip ) were then transfected with 0 . 25 (cid:3) g of cDNA of rat Cort WT or Cort W525K cloned into pIRES2 - AcGFP1 expression vector ( Clontech ) , and then 10 (cid:3) M reti - noic acid was added for differentiation . After 48 h , the cells were fixed . Yamadaetal . • Dynamin – CortactinRingComplexStabilizesActinBundles J .

Non - muscle actin ( Cytoskeleton Inc . ) was polymerized in F - buffer con - taining10m M Tris - HCl , 0 . 2m M DTT , 0 . 2m M CaCl 2 , 2m M MgCl 2 , 50m M KCl , and 0 . 5 m M ATP , pH 7 . 5 , for 1 h . Dynamin 1 and cortactin at indicated concentrations were then incubated with 3 . 3 (cid:3) M F - actin in the presence or absence of 0 . 1 m M GTP , GDP , or GTP (cid:4) S for 1 h . Actin bundles were sedimented by low - speed centrifugation , at 5000 (cid:5) g , for 10 min ( Dixon et al . , 2008 ) . The pellet and supernatant were separated by SDS - PAGE , stainedwithSYPROOrange ( LifeTechnologies ) , andquantitatedby densitometry using ImageJ . All steps were performed at room temperature . Pull - down assay and immunoprecipitation . GST pull - down assays were performed as described previously ( Yamada et al . , 2009b ) . GST - fusion proteins ( 100 (cid:3) g ) bound to glutathione - Sepharose beads ( GE Health - care ) wereincubatedwith1mgofmousebrainextractin1 % TX - 100 , 100 m M KCl , 0 . 5 m M EDTA , 10 m M NaF , 20 m M HEPES / KOH , pH 7 . 4 , and a Protease Inhibitor Cocktail tablet ( Roche Diagnostics ) . Dynamin 1 that bound to the beads was then analyzed by Western blotting . For detection of the direct interaction between dynamin 1 PRD and Cort WT , 5 (cid:3) g of GST - Cort WT or Cort W525K bound to glutathione beads was incu - bated with an equal amount of recombinant dynamin 1 PRD at 4°C for 2 h . Dynamin 1 PRD bound to the beads was then analyzed by SDS - PAGE and stained by Coomassie Brilliant Blue . For the immunoprecipitation assay , differentiated NG108 - 15 cells were cotransfected with GFP - tagged dynamin 1 and either myc - tagged cortactin or cortactin (cid:1) SH3 .

Samples were examined using a spinning disc confocal mi - croscope system ( CSU10 , Yokogawa Electric Co . ) combined with an inverted microscope ( IX - 71 , Olympus Optical Co . , Ltd . ) and a CoolSNAP - HQ camera ( Roper Industries ) . The confocal system was controlled by MetaMorph Software ( Molecular Devices ) . When necessary , images were processed using Adobe Photoshop CS3 or Illustrator CS3 software . Electron microscopy . For negative staining , actin bundles were formed in vitro as above and diluted 1 : 20 with F - buffer . Dynamin 1 – cortactin complexes were formed by incu - bating 1 (cid:3) M each of the proteins in cytosolic buffer ( 25 m M HEPES – KOH , 25 m M KCl , 2 . 5 m M magnesium acetate , 100 m M potassium glutamate , pH 7 . 2 ) at 37°C for 15 min . The samples were absorbed to a formvar - and carbon - coated copper grid and then stained with 3 % uranyl acetate in ddH 2 O for 2 min . For morphometric analysis of ring complex formation , negative - stained samples with similar density were photographed at 30 , 000 – 40 , 000 (cid:5) . For each condition , 5 areas corresponding to 0 . 5 (cid:3) m 2 ( total 2 . 5 (cid:3) m 2 ) were randomly selected , and the number of rings was counted . Close rings and open rings that have more than three quarters were de - fined as “rings . ” Preembedding immunoelectron microscopy was performed as described previously ( Naka - gawa et al . , 2001 ) . Briefly , SH - SY5Y cells were fixed with cytoskeleton buffer ( 10 m M MES , 150 m M NaCl , 5 m M EGTA , 5 m M MgCl 2 and 5 m M glucose , pH6 . 0 ) containing10 (cid:3) g / mlphalloidin , 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 , and 3 % formaldehyde for 1 min , and then for an additional 30 min with - out Triton X - 100 , before being washed with 5 (cid:3) g / ml phalloidin in PBS . After incubation in blocking solution ( 10 (cid:3) g / ml phalloidin , 2 mg / ml BSA , and 100 m M glycine in PBS ) , samples were incubated with primary anti - body diluted in blocking solution , washed with 5 (cid:3) g / ml phalloidin in PBS , incubated with 5 or 10 nm gold conjugated with sec - ondary antibodies , and then fixed with 2 . 5 % glutaraldehyde and 5 (cid:3) g / ml phalloidin in PBS . The samples were postfixed with 1 % OsO 4 in 0 . 1 M sodium cacodylate buffer for 1 h , dehydrated , and embedded in Epon 812 for ultrathin sectioning . For whole - mount immunoelectron mi - croscopy , SH - SY5Y cells cultured on fibronectin - and formvar - coated gold grids were fixed and immunostained by the preembedding method described above , and then negatively stained with 3 % uranyl ace - tate . Electron microscopic observation was performed using Hitachi H - 7100 transmis - sion electron microscope . Morphometric analysis . For measurement of filopodium length , SH - SY5Y cells were fixed and stained with rhodamine - or Alexa Fluor 488 - conjugated phalloidin . Actin - rich struc - tures that possessed lamellipodia and filopodia at tips of neurites were defined as “growth cones” and digital images were acquired at 100 (cid:5) magnification . Up to three filopodia for each growth cone were ran - domly selected , and their length was measured with ImageJ software ( v . 1 . 40 g ) . To assess colocalization of dynamin 1 with cortactin or clathrin , immunostained cells were photographed , and the immunoreactivi - ties along randomly selected filopodia were measured using Meta - Morph software . To quantify immunocytochemical expression of dynamin 1 , immunostained cells were photographed at fixed expo - sure of 1000 ms for dynamin 1 , and 1500 ms for phalloidin . Images of randomly selected 35 filopodia were used to measure “average fluo - rescence intensities ( F . I . ) in filopodia” using MetaMorph software after background subtraction Figure 2 .

GTP hydrolysis was measured at 1 m M GTP using a colorimetric assay to detect Pi release as previously described ( Soulet et al . , 2005 ) .

In - geldigestionandMSanalysis . Proteinsbindingwithdynamin1were separated by SDS - PAGE and stained by Coomassie Brilliant Blue . Gel pieces of interest were cut , and incubated with 10 m M DTT for 15 min and 100 m M Iodoacetamide for 15 min . After washing with methanol / water / acetic acid ( 50 : 40 : 10 ) 4 times , the gel pieces were soaked with 50 m M ammonium bicarbonate for 10 min and acetonitrile for 10 min . Gel pieces were then completely dried in a Speed Vac evaporator ( Thermo Savant ) . The dried gel pieces were swollen in 2 ml of 50 m M ammonium bicarbonate containing 0 . 02 mg of trypsin ( Promega ) . Another 30 ml of 50 m M ammonium bicarbonate was then added and the mixture was incubated in 37°C for overnight . After the in - gel digestion , dried samples were redissolved in 5 (cid:3) l of acetonitrile / water / TFA ( trifluoroacetic acid ; 5 : 95 : 0 . 1 ) , and a 0 . 5 (cid:3) l aliquot was used for matrix - assisted laser desorption - ionization mass spectrometry ( MALDI - MS ) analysis . The matrix solution was prepared by saturating 2 , 5 - dihydroxybenzoic acid in acetonitrile / water / TFA ( 33 : 67 : 0 . 1 ) and was diluted fourfold before being mixed with the peptide solution . Cocrystallization was per - formed by depositing 0 . 5 (cid:3) l of peptide solution and 0 . 5 (cid:3) l of the diluted matrix solution together to the same spot of a MALDI plate , followed by drying at room temperature . MALDI - MS spectra were obtained using a Voyager Linear DE ( Applied Biosystems ) . The Voy - ager was operated in delayed - extraction mode and the spectra were calibrated using the internal standards , angiotensin III [ average mo - lecular weight ( MW ) 931 . 1 Da ] and oxidized insulin B chain ( average MW 3495 . 9 ) . MASCOT ( Matrix Sciences ) was used as the search engine for peptide mass fingerprinting . Statistical analysis . Data were analyzed using KaleidaGraph ( v 4 . 1 ) for Macintosh ( Synergy Software ) to perform statistical analysis .

Results Dynamin 1 is implicated in actin dynamics in brain cytosol To examine whether dynamin 1 is involved in actin dynamics in mousebraincytosol , weperformedanactinassemblyassay , inwhich actin polymerization can be quantitatively monitored using pyrene - conjugated actin added to the cytosol . Rapid actin assembly was observed in the brain cytosol in the presence of PS - liposomes ( Fig . 1 A ) , confirming previously reported acidic phospholipid - stimulated actin polymerization ( Yamada et al . , 2009b ) . Addition of anti - dynamin 1 antibody , but not preimmune IgG to the cytosol , strongly inhibited the PS - dependent actin assembly . This inhibi - tory effect was blocked by the preincubation of the antibody with the correspondingantigenicpeptides ( Fig . 1 A ) , suggestingthat thedynamin1antibodyactedinaspecificmanner . Incubationofthe dynamin 1 antibodies with rat brain cytosol resulted in an (cid:10) 60 % immune - depletion of dynamin 1 ( Fig . 1 F ) . Actin assembly was sig - nificantlyreducedinthedynamin1 - depletedbraincytosol ( Fig . 1 B ) . Specificity of the dynamin 1 antibody used for the immune - depletion was suggested by the fact that the antibody did not recog - nize purified dynamin 2 or either dynamin 2 or dynamin 3 in testis cytosol ( Fig . 1 D ; Kusumi et al . , 2007 ) . Furthermore , the dynamin 1 antibody was inactivated by preincubation with the corresponding antigenic peptides ( Fig . 1 E ) . Dynasore , a potent inhibitor for dy - namins ( Macia et al . , 2006 ) , also inhibited the actin assembly in a dose - dependent manner ( Fig . 1 C ) . These results strongly indicate that dynamin 1 participates in the formation and / or stabilization of F - actin in the brain cytosol . In lipid - induced actin assembly , actin polymerization is initi - ated at the liposome surface ( Ma et al . , 1998 ) , to which dynamin is also recruited ( Otsuka et al . , 2009 ) . To search for actin - regulating proteins that cooperatively function with dynamin 1 , actin assembly in mouse brain cytosol was stimulated with lipo - somes , and proteins that cosedimented with the liposomes were analyzed by MALDI - MS ( Fig . 2 A ) . Using this method , we iden - tified cortactin , an F - actin associated protein , as a putative bind - ing partner for dynamin 1 . A specific interaction between dynamin 1 and cortactin was then found by pull - down assay and immunoprecipitation . The dynamin1 - cortactin interaction was mediated by dynamin 1 PRD and cortactin SH3 as demonstrated usingCort (cid:1) SH3orCortW525K , amutantdeficientindynamin - binding ( Schafer et al . , 2002 ; Fig . 2 B , C ) . Furthermore , we found that exogenously expressed myc - tagged Cort WT , but not Cort (cid:1) SH3 , coprecipitated with GFP - tagged dynamin 1 in NG108 - 15 cells ( mouse neuroblastoma (cid:5) rat glioma hybrid cells ) ( Fig . 2 D ) . Thus , we found a specific interaction between cortactin SH3 do - main and dynamin 1 PRD . Figure4 . Dynamin1andcortactinassociatewithactinfilaments .

Neurosci . , March6 , 2013 • 33 ( 10 ) : 4514 – 4526 • 4519 Dynamin 1 and cortactin colocalize in puncta arranged along growth cone filopodia , and accumulates at the F - actin bundles As demonstrated above , neuronal dy - namin 1 is involved in the regulation of actin assembly ( Fig . 1 ) . In addition , cor - tactin is implicated in the regulation of actin dynamics ( Ammer and Weed , 2008 ) . Therefore , we next examined the localization of these proteins in actin - rich neuronal growth cones . In primary cul - tured cortical neurons , dynamin 1 and cortactin were visible in puncta aligned along the growth cone filopodia , and they were often colocalized ( Fig . 3 A , bottom ) . While clathrin was enriched in the “palm” region of growth cones , only trace amounts were present in the filopodia ( Fig . 3 B ) . This suggested that participation in clathrin - mediated endocytosis is not a major func - tion of dynamin 1 or cortactin in the filopodia . To further elucidate function of dy - namin1andcortactiningrowthcones , we used SH - SY5Y cells ( a human neuroblas - toma cell line ) , widely used as model cells to study growth cones ( Meyerson et al . , 1992 ; Hynds et al . , 2003 ; Johnsson and Karlsson , 2012 ) . AsconfirmedbyWestern blotting , all the dynamin isoforms were expressed both in SH - SY5Y cells and NG108 - 15 cells as was the case in P0 mouse brain . ( Fig . 3 C ) . As in primary cul - tured neurons , dynamin 1 and cortactin in SH - SY5Y cells also localized as period - ically aligned dots along the growth cone filopodia ( Fig . 3 D , top ) , and (cid:10) 70 % of dynamin - positive puncta were positive for cortactin ( Fig . 3 E , left column ) . Using antibody against C terminus of dynamin 1 ( EP801 ) , similar immunolocalization was observed , and the dynamin - positive im - munoreactivities well colocalized with cortactin ( 73 . 2 (cid:8) 2 . 3 % , n (cid:3) 50 ) . Exogenously expressed Cort WT , but not Cort (cid:1) SH3 , colocalized with endogenous dynamin 1 in the filopodia of SH - SY5Y cells ( Fig . 3 D , middle and bottom , E ) , indicating that SH3 - mediated interaction is essential for the periodic localization of dynamin 1 in filopodia . We further confirmed , by RNAi depletion , that periodic local - ization of dynamin 1 along filopodia is specific to the protein . By RNAi expression of dynamin 1 was selectively knocked down in SH - SY5Y cells without disturbing the expression of other dy - namin isoforms and cortactin ( Fig . 3 F ) . Morphologically , the RNAi reduced the formation of growth cone filopodia ( Fig . 3 G , bottom left ) , and the fluorescence intensity for dynamin 1 was reduced to (cid:10) 10 % ( Fig . 3 H ) . Characteristic periodic staining for dynamin 1 was disappeared in growth cone filopodia formed in this condition ( Fig . 3 G , bottom right ) . Thus , specificity of the periodic localization of dynamin 1 along filopodia was con - firmed . Interestingly , immunoelectron microscopy revealed that both dynamin 1 and cortactin were associated with actin fila - ments in SH - SY5Y cells ( Fig . 4 A ) . Using whole - mount immuno - gold staining , we often observed dynamin 1 and cortactin on F - actin bundles in growth cone filopodia ( Fig . 4 B ) . Dysfunction of dynamin 1 and cortactin destabilizes filopodia of growth cones The striking colocalization of dynamin 1 and cortactin in growth cone filopodia , and their presence on actin filaments prompted us to investigate whether dynamin 1 and cortactin function in the filopodia . Time - lapsed observation of growth cones of SH - SY5Y cells revealed that the application of dynasore , a dynamin inhibitor , resulted in rapid retraction of the growth cone filopodia . Within 300 s of dynasore application , the mean filopodium length was decreased by (cid:10) 50 % ( Fig . 5 A – C ) . Furthermore , the retraction of filopodia was recovered by washing out dynasore ( Fig . 5 B , C ) , indicating that dynasore - induced retraction was reversible . The dynasore - induced filopodia retraction was abolished by the presence of Jas - plakinolide , an actin depolymerization inhibitor ( Bubb et al . , 2000 ; Fig . 5 B , C ) , indicating that inhibition of dynamin by dynasore leads to destabilization of F - actin .

These suppres - sivephenotypeswerecancelledbyexpressionofCortWT , butnotof Cort W525K mutant ( Fig . 5 E , F ) . These results strongly suggested that both dynamin 1 and cortactin are crucial for the stabilization of growth cone filopodia . Consistently , overexpression of cortactin in hippocampalneuronsresultsintheincreaseofsizeandspreadingofgrowthcones ( Kurklinsky et al . , 2011 ) . Dynamin 1 – cortactin complexes bundle F - actin Given the presence of dynamin 1 and cortactin on actin fila - ments , and the strong functional link to filopodia , which are supported by F - actin bundles , we next examined the effects of dynamin 1 and cortactin on actin filaments in vitro . F - actin bun - dling by dynamin 1 and cortactin was quantitatively assessed using a low - speed sedimentation assay ( Dixon et al . , 2008 ) , in which F - actin bundles are recovered in the pellet . Only trace amount of F - actin bundles were observed when F - actin was in - cubated with either dynamin 1 or cortactin alone . On the other hand , formation of F - actin bundles was drastically increased ( ap - proximately fourfold ) when 5 (cid:3) M both dynamin 1 and cortactin were added ( Fig . 6 A , B ) . In addition , considerable amounts of dynamin 1 and cortactin were coprecipitated in the pellet ( Fig . 6 A , B ) . F - actin bundle formation was not increased when cortac - tin was replaced either with Cort (cid:1) SH3 , or Cort W525K , mutants that are unable to bind to dynamin ( Fig . 6 A ) . TomorphologicallyvisualizetheformationofF - actinbundlesby dynamin 1 and cortactin , preformed F - actin was incubated with or without cortactin and dynamin 1 in the presence of GTP , and then observed by fluorescent microscopy . F - actin alone appeared as uni - form threads , and addition of dynamin 1 to F - actin did not produce any visible changes ( Fig . 6 C ) . F - actin incubated only with cortactin often formed small clusters , consistent with a previous report ( Fig . 6 C , Huang et al . , 1997 ) . Surprisingly , the presence of both dynamin 1 and cortactin resulted in the formation of long and thick F - actin bundles , 135 . 1 (cid:8) 8 . 3 (cid:3) m in length ( n (cid:3) 15 ) ( Fig . 6 C , right ) . Next , we examined the localization of dynamin 1 and cortactin on the thick F - actin bundles using immunofluores - cence . As shown in Figure 7 A , both dy - namin 1 and cortactin were observed as bright puncta periodically aligned along the F - actin bundles , where the two pro - teins were often colocalized . The immu - noreactive puncta were arranged along F - actin bundles with an average interval of 1 . 33 (cid:8) 0 . 03 (cid:3) m ( n (cid:3) 159 ) . Electron microscopic observation of the same samples revealed that F - actin bundles generated by dynamin 1 and cor - tactin were periodically decorated with protein clusters ( Fig . 7 B ) . The interval be - tween the protein clusters was in good agreement with that observed by immu - nofluorescence ( 1 . 03 (cid:8) 0 . 05 (cid:3) m , n (cid:3) 54 ) ( Fig . 7 B ) . Occasionally , rows of protein complexes twined around approximately three to four actin filaments , which were suggestive of a spiral , were observed ( Fig . 7 B , inset ) . It is very likely that the protein clusters observed on the F - actin bundles in this electron micrograph represent dynamin 1 – cortactin complexes . Dynamin 1 and cortactin copolymerize into ring - shaped structures that are sensitive to dynamin inhibition Dynamin 1 assembles into rings and spirals by itself under a low ionic condition ( Hinshaw and Schmid , 1995 ) , or in the presence of liposomes ( Takei et al . , 1998 ; Stowell et al . , 1999 ) . Dynamin 1 also coassembles into rings with amphiphysin or endophilin ( Takei et al . , 1999 ; Farsad et al . , 2001 ) . Likewise , dynamin 1 and cortactin formed ring - shaped complexes in the presence of GTP as revealed by negative - stain electron microscopy ( Fig . 8 A ) . Both open and closed ring complexes were observed , and the size of the closed rings was 25 (cid:8) 1 . 0 nm along the inner diameter ( n (cid:3) 20 ) , and 42 . 3 (cid:8) 1 . 0 nm along the outer diam - eter ( n (cid:3) 24 ) . Neither dynamin 1 nor cortactin alone formed rings using the same buffer conditions . Cort W525K failed to assemble into ring complexes with dynamin 1 ( Fig . 8 A ) . The formation of these ring complexes was sensitive to func - tional inhibition of dynamin 1 . Anti - dynamin 1 antibody that suppressed actin assembly in brain cytosol ( Fig . 1 ) prevented the formation of dynamin 1 – cortactin ring complexes ( Fig . 8 B , left ) . This inhibitory effect of the antibody was prevented by preab - sorption of the antibody with the corresponding peptides ( Fig . 8 B , middle ) . The dynamin 1 antibody also disrupted pre - formed dynamin 1 – cortactin ring complexes ( Fig . 8 B , right ) . Furthermore , dynasore suppressed formation of the ring com - plexes ( Fig . 8 C ) . Since dynamin functions in membrane fission as a mecha - nochemical enzyme driven by GTP hydrolysis ( Sweitzer and Hinshaw , 1998 ; Takei et al . , 1998 ; Marks et al . , 2001 ; Roux et al . , 2006 ; Ramachandran and Schmid , 2008 ; Faelber et al . , 2011 ; Ford et al . , 2011 ) , we next examined whether guanine nucleotide conditions affect the conformation of dynamin Figure6 .

The ring for - mation was observed even without gua - nine nucleotides , or with GDP , but the rings were the most prominent in the presence of GTP ( Fig . 8 D ) . Interest - ingly , in the presence of GTP (cid:4) S , an unhydrolyzable GTP analog , or substi - tution of dynamin 1 WT with dynamin 1 K44A , a GTPase defective mutant ( Damke et al . , 1994 ) , most of dynamin 1 - cortactin rings were widely open or al - most linear - shaped ( Fig . 8 D , E ) . These observations clearly indicate that the con - formation of the dynamin 1 – cortactin complex is altered upon GTP hydrolysis . Dynamin 1 and cortactin ring complexes stabilize actin filaments As conformational change of dynamin - cortactin ring was induced by guanine nu - cleotide conditions ( Fig . 8 D , E ) , we further examined whether dynamin 1 - cortactin - dependent F - actin bundle formation is af - fectedbyanalterationofguaninenucleotideconditions . As revealed by a low - speed sed - imentation assay , F - actin bundle formation wasunchangedbyalterationofguaninenu - cleotide conditions ( Fig . 9 A ) . Consistently , F - actin bundles were morphologically ap - parent in the presence of GTP (cid:4) S , an unhy - drolyzable analog . Moreover , substitution ofWTdynamin1iswithdynamin1K44A , a GTPase defective mutant ( Damke et al . , 1994 ) , also resulted in F - actin bundle for - mation ( Fig . 9 B , bottom ) . Interestingly , however , the localiza - tion of dynamin 1 and cortactin on F - actin bundles was dependent on gua - nine nucleotide conditions . While both proteins were periodically present along the F - actin bundles in the presence of GTP ( Fig . 9 B , top , see also Fig . 7 A ) , their localization became diffuse in the presence of GTP (cid:4) S or when using dynamin1 K44A ( Fig . 9 B , middle and bottom ) . We next wondered whether the altered localization of dy - namin 1 and cortactin caused any changes in the stability of F - actin bundles . To test this hypothesis , we analyzed the depoly - merization rate of F - actin to G - actin under various conditions . To this end , the kinetics of preformed pyrene - labeled F - actin depolymerization was examined either by tenfold dilution ( Oka - moto et al . , 2007 ) or by the addition of Mycalolide B ( Saito et al . , 1994 ) . In the presence of dynamin 1 and cortactin , the rate of depolymerization by dilution was clearly decreased as potent as by (cid:1) - actinin , an actin - crosslinking protein , indicating that dynamin 1 and cortactin stabilize F - actin bundles . ( Fig . 9 C ) . We next tested whether guanine nucleotide conditions affect the stability of the F - actin bundles decorated with dynamin 1 and cortactin . As shown in Figure 9 , D and E , the F - actin bundles were most resis - tant to the depolymerization treatments in the presence of GTP compared with GTP (cid:4) S or no nucleotide . We also found that cortactin , but not the Cort W525K mutant , stimulated dynamin GTPase activity (cid:10) 2 - fold ( Fig . 9 F ) . Together , these results suggest that F - actin bundles are stabilized by GTP hydrolysis that is me - diated by dynamin 1 – cortactin complexes . Discussion This study demonstrated that dynamin 1 – cortactin complexes stabilize F - actin bundles , which is necessary for the proper for - mation of growth cone filopodia . Thus , neuronal dynamin 1 plays an essential role in actin regulation in addition to its well studied function in synaptic vesicle endocytosis . Dynamin 1 is involved in actin dynamics in vivo and in vitro Growth cone filopodia require bundled F - actin , and the loss of the bundles leads to growth cone collapse ( Zhou and Cohan , 2001 ) . In this study , acute inhibition of dynamin 1 in neurons by dynasore application caused rapid collapse of the growth cone filopodia . This effect was prevented by application of Jasplakino - lide , an actin depolymerization inhibitor ( Fig . 5 B , C ) . In addi - tion , actin assembly in vitro was drastically decreased by the inhibition of dynamin 1 ( Fig . 1 ) . These results clearly indicated that dynamin 1 was essential for the stabilization of F - actin . Sup - porting this notion , immunoelectron microscopy revealed that dynamin 1 was present on actin filaments and F - actin bundles in the growth cone filopodia ( Fig . 4 ) . Consistently , it is recently Figure7 . Dynamin1colocalizeswithcortactininpunctaalongF - actinbundles .

Neurosci . , March6 , 2013 • 33 ( 10 ) : 4514 – 4526 Yamadaetal . • Dynamin – CortactinRingComplexStabilizesActinBundles reported that dynamin directly binds to F - actin and it can pro - mote the elongation of individual actin filaments by displace - ment of actin capping proteins from actin filaments ( Gu et al . , 2010 ) . A dynamin 1 – cortactin complex is required for bundling of the actin filaments Dynamin 1 and cortactin copolymerized into ring - shaped com - plexes ( Fig . 8 ) , and in the presence of F - actin , the complexes were often observed twined around F - actin bundles ( Fig . 7 B , inset ) . Replacing Cort WT with Cort W525K mutant inhibited the ring formation , in - dicating that the interaction between dy - namin 1 PRD and cortactin SH3 domain was essential for the complex formation . Furthermore , the formation of the ring complexes was disturbed by dynasore ap - plication and an antibody against amino acid residues 633 – 647 of dynamin 1 ( Fig . 8 B , C ) . Since the anti - dynamin 1 antibody recognizes a region adjacent to the dy - namin stalk domain ( Faelber et al . , 2011 ; Ford et al . , 2011 ) , in all likelihood , the presence of this antibody would interfere with intramolecular interactions via stalk domain of dynamin 1 that is required for dynamin dimerization and polymeriza - tion . It is noteworthy that acute inhibition of dynamin 1 by both dynasore applica - tion and the dynamin 1 antibody drasti - cally decreased actin assembly in vitro ( Fig . 1 ) and caused rapid retraction of growth cone filopodia ( Fig . 5 ) . Further - more , depletion of cortactin by RNAi also reduced filopodium formation , which is recovered by expression of cortactin WT but not by a dynamin binding - deficient mutant ( Fig . 5 ) . These observations strongly suggest that the dynamin 1 – cor - tactin complex functions to form F - actin bundles in vivo and inhibition of the com - plex formation yields destabilized F - actin bundles in growth cone filopodia . In sup - port of this notion , similar periodic local - izations of dynamin 1 and cortactin in puncta were observed along both F - actin bundles formed in vitro ( Fig . 7 ) and growth cone filopodia ( Fig . 3 ) . Stabilization of actin filaments by a dynamin 1 – cortactin complex In the presence of dynamin 1 and cortactin , F - actin became resistant to depolymeriza - tion induced by either dilution or a depo - lymerizing toxin ( Fig . 9 C – E ) . Furthermore , this effect was more prominent in the presence of GTP compared with unhy - drolyzable GTP (cid:4) S or in the absence of GTP ( Fig . 9 D , E ) . These observations indicate that dynamin 1 – cortactin com - plex is implicated in stabilizing F - actin bundles in GTP hydrolysis - dependent manner . How might GTP hydrolysis by the dynamin 1 – cortactin com - plex increase the stability of F - actin bundles ? In synaptic vesicle endocytosis , dynamin 1 polymerizes into a ring , and the confor - mational change of dynamin upon GTP hydrolysis provides the mechanical force necessary for membrane fission ( Sweitzer and Hinshaw , 1998 ; Takei et al . , 1998 ; Marks et al . , 2001 ; Roux et al . , 2006 ; Ramachandran and Schmid , 2008 ) . It is conceivable that dynamin 1 – cortactin complexes use this mechanochemical en - zyme property of dynamin 1 . The ring - shaped dynamin 1 – cor - tactin complex would hold several actin filaments and then Figure8 .

Neurosci . , March6 , 2013 • 33 ( 10 ) : 4514 – 4526 • 4523 mechanically grab the F - actin bundle more tightly upon GTP hydrolysis ( Fig . 10 ) . In support of this notion , dynamin 1 – cor - tactin ring complexes were observed both at open and closed conformations , and , in the presence of GTP (cid:4) S , the complexes were widely open or almost linear - shaped ( Fig . 8 ) , indicating that the conformation of the dynamin 1 – cortactin ring complex is altered upon GTP hydrolysis . The ring complexes were twined around several actin filaments that were interconnected each other to form thicker F - actin bundles ( Fig . 7 B ) . Such conforma - tional changes in dynamin 1 – cortactin complexes may have led to different localization patterns of dynamin 1 and cortactin on F - actin bundles in the presence of GTP or GTP (cid:4) S ( Fig . 9 B ) . The presence of dynamin 1 – cortactin complexes around F - actin bundles would physically obstructs treadmilling of F - actin . Alternatively , the interaction between dynamin 1 – cor - tactin complexes and actin filaments might interfere with the Figure 9 .

It has been reported that presence of dynamin and cortactin alter the affinity of F - actin to cofilin ( Mooren et al . , 2009 ) or a capping protein gelsolin ( Guetal . , 2010 ) . Ineithercase , however , themechanisms are currently unknown . Our results indicate that ring - shaped dynamin 1 – cortactin complexes stabilize F - actin bundles both in vitro and in vivo . It is noteworthy that the complex uses the GTP - dependent mechano - chemical enzyme property of dynamin 1 ( Fig . 10 ) . Now that the mode of action of dynamin has been largely clarified by crystal - lography studies ( Faelber et al . , 2011 ; Ford et al . , 2011 ) , future studies will be needed to clarify how the dynamin 1 – cortactin ring complexes may be involved in neuronal development .
