Peptide surfactant AM1 forms an interfacial ﬁlm that can be switched , reversibly , from a high - to low - elasticity state , with rapid loss of emulsion and foam stability . Using neutron reﬂectometry , we ﬁnd that the AM1 ﬁlm comprises a thin ( approx . 15 A ˚ ) layer of ordered peptide in both states , conﬁrming that it is possible to drastically alter the mechanical properties of an interfacial ensemble without signiﬁcantly altering its concentration or macromolecular organization . We also report the ﬁrst experimentally determined Young’s modulus of a peptide ﬁlm self - assembled at the air – water interface ( E Z 80 MPa for AM1 , switching to E ! 20 MPa ) . These ﬁndings suggest a fundamental link between E and the macroscopic stability of peptide - containing foam . Finally , we report studies of a designed peptide surfactant , Lac21E , which we ﬁnd forms a stronger switchable ﬁlm than AM1 ( E Z 335 MPa switching to E ! 4 MPa ) . In contrast to AM1 , Lac21E switching is caused by peptide dissociation from the interface ( i . e . by self - disassembly ) . This research conﬁrms that small changes in molecular design can lead to similar macroscopic behaviour via surprisingly different mechanisms .

INTRODUCTION Soft interfaces occur at the boundary between air and water , or oil and water , and are ubiquitous in industries ranging from pharmaceuticals and foods to oil and minerals ( Lucassen 1981 ; Debregeas et al . 1998 ) . Such interfaces are often stabilized by chemical or polymer surfactants which , in the case of static emulsions , induce stability to coalescence that can be partly understood within the Derjaguin – Landau – Verwey – Overbeek ( DLVO ) framework ( Israelachvili 1992 ; Myers 1999 ) . Nevertheless , the dynamic behaviour of surfactant - covered soft interfaces remains poorly understood in many respects and is an area of active research ( Fragneto et al . 1995 ; Chen et al . 2004 ; Dagastine et al . 2006 ) . The need for temporary emulsions or foams across a range of areas of practical interest has encouraged a search for switchable surfactants which are able to destabilize such systems in response to a trigger ( Rosslee & Abbott 2000 ; Abbott 2001 ; Aydogan & Abbott 2001 ; Dexter et al . 2006 ; Liu et al . 2006 ) . Several switchable surfactants have been described , including grafted copolymers that undergo a pH - induced struc - tural change ( Mathur et al . 1998 ) , azobenzene surfac - tants triggered by UV irradiation ( Shin & Abbott 1999 ; Shang et al . 2003 ) , ferrocenyl - based surfactants trig - gered by redox mechanisms ( Gallardo et al . 1995 , 1996 ; Aydogan et al . 2002 ) and an oil - soluble long - chain alkyl amidine surfactant triggered by conversion of the amidine group to a charged amidinium bicarbonate ( Liu et al . 2006 ) . These surfactants all switch by mechanisms that change surfactant interfacial afﬁnity ( i . e . by reducing or removing the DLVO stabilizing forces ) . Current systems suffer from slow rates of switching , incomplete removal of material from the interface leading to ﬂocculation but not coalescence , suitability for emulsions but not foams and / or require triggers that are difﬁcult to implement at large scale . Peptides comprise amino acid residues ordered into an informational chain , constituting part of a protein or else designed de novo , and are increasingly viewed as building blocks for the design of new materials including surfac - tants ( Zhang 2003 , 2006 ; Zhao & Zhang 2004 , 2006 ; J . R . Soc .

Received 3 April 2007 Accepted 14 May 2007 47 This journal is q 2007 The Royal Society Rapaport 2006 ; Reches & Gazit 2006 ) . Recently , an aqueous - soluble peptide ( AM1 ) has been reported which has switchable surfactant properties ( Dexter et al . 2006 ; Malcolm et al . 2006 a ) . Under conditions where the histidine - containing peptide binds metal ions , AM1 aids the formation of high - quality foams and emulsions , yet these can be efﬁciently and reversibly destabilized by a simple pH change or by the addition of a chelating agent . The transition between stable macroscopic states is extremely rapid , with coalescence complete in seconds , satisfying a key objective of research into switchable surfactants ( Liu et al . 2006 ) . Surprisingly , interfacial tension does not signiﬁcantly change as a result of the switch ( Dexter etal . 2006 ) suggestingthatdestabilization is not accompanied by a change in peptide interfacial concentration ( i . e . there was no evidence of interfacial depopulation ) . However , themaximum tensilestressthat the interfacial ﬁlm can transmit changed by more than an order of magnitude and a signiﬁcant change in interfacial elasticity occurred ( from 120 mN m K 1 in the strong - or high - elasticity state to less than 30 mN m K 1 in the weak - or low - elasticity state ) . This result suggests that , for AM1 , known emulsion and foam stabilization mechanisms might be supplemented with an additional stability - controlling factor that is related to the mechan - ical properties of the interfacial ﬁlm . The mechanical properties of protein and peptide ﬁlms located at ﬂuid – ﬂuid interfaces have been directly measured using the Cambridge interfacial tensiometer ( CIT ; Jones & Middelberg 2002 a – c , 2003 ; Dexter et al . 2006 ; Malcolm et al . 2006 a , b ) . The CIT can be thought of as a two - dimensional analogue of conventional volumetric materials stress – strain testing devices . It measures a force – strain curve of an interfacial ﬁlm connected between two parallel silica ﬁbres ( ﬁgure 1 ) from which an interfacial elasticity , which is the product of the Young modulus ( E ) and the ﬁlm thickness ( t ) , can be obtained ( Jones & Middelberg 2002 a – c ) . In practice , the ﬁlm thickness t is difﬁcult to experimentally measure for very thin protein and peptide ﬁlms and can change due to molecular rearrangement in the interfacial plane . These difﬁcul - ties have , to date , prevented experimental determina - tion of the Young modulus for such ﬁlms . The detailed structure of the AM1 peptide inter - facial ﬁlm and hence the basis for rapid switchability have not previously been known , and the absence of data on ﬁlm thickness has prevented calculation of the Young modulus . We have hypothesized that precise ordering of the peptide units at the interface leads to the separate control of peptide interface and peptide – peptide bonding in a way that is not possible with complex protein molecules and that this might be the basis for rapid switching of ﬁlm strength . In the present study , we carried out neutron reﬂectivity studies of the AM1 interfacial ﬁlm to directly determine ﬁlm thick - ness and also to investigate how the individual peptide molecules are organized at the interface . Neutron reﬂectometry is a direct method for probing the amount of material adsorbed at a soft interface ( Lu et al . 1996 , 1998 ) , while selective deuteration allows the reﬂectivity proﬁle of a nanostructure to be altered without changing its chemical composition ( Fragneto et al . 1995 ; Strzalka et al . 2004 ) . We conﬁrmed that the AM1 surface coverage is approximately the same in both high - and low - elasticity states and showed that in both cases the ﬁlm comprises a thin layer of ordered peptides . We also report here a designed peptide sequence , Lac21E ( Fairman et al . 1996 ) , which we show can be reversibly switched by pH change to give rapid and large changes in mechanical strength and also interfacial tension . Neutron reﬂectometry conﬁrmed that , unlike AM1 , the Lac21E ﬁlm switches via interfacial depopulation ( i . e . by self - disassembly ) . The results suggest that switchable peptide surfactants can be designed to allow independent control of phase destabilization through two different mechanisms—the known depopulation mechanism used by switchable chemical and polymer strain , ( e ) piezoelectricstrain ( ) application ε force ( F ) measurement T - piece length ( L ) ( a ) t not drawn to scale ( b ) F / L 0 . 01 Figure 1 .

The ﬁlm in this schematic comprises lysozyme ( PDB ID 1LYZ ) arrayed at the air – water interface ( Lu et al . 1998 ; Malcolm et al . 2006 b ) to give a ﬁlm connected between two T - piece ﬁbres that have been modiﬁed to promote protein binding ( Jones & Middelberg 2002 a ) . Hydrophobic residues ( yellow ) are distributed over the protein surface . ( b ) The force ( F ) measured by the CIT is normalized by T - piece length ( L ) to give a curve of interfacial stress ( F / L ) versus strain ( 3 ) . Interfacial elasticity ( E ! t ) , which is the product of Young’s modulus ( E ) and ﬁlm thickness ( t ) , is calculated as the gradient of the linear region ( 3 ! 1 % ) of the interfacial stress – strain curve . 48 The properties of switchable peptide ﬁlms A .

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Lac21E was custom synthesized by GenScript Corpo - ration ( Piscataway , NJ ) or GL Biochem ( Shanghai ) . Lac21E incorporating deuterated valine and leucine ( d Lac21E , d 8 - valine , d 10 - leucine ) and AM1 incorporat - ing deuterated valine and leucine ( d AM1 , d 8 - valine , d 10 - leucine ) were custom synthesized by AnaSpec ( San Jose , CA ) . Purity in each case was more than 95 % by RP - HPLC . Peptide content was determined by quan - titative amino acid analysis ( Australian Proteome Analysis Facility , Sydney ) . Sodium 4 - ( 2 - hydroxyethyl ) - 1 - piperazine ethanesulphonate ( HEPES ) was from Spec - trum Chemicals ( Gardena , CA ) and was chosen for its capacity to buffer at both pH 3 and 7 , as well as its low - binding afﬁnity for metal ions . All other reagents were analytical grade . 2 . 1 . Peptide ﬁlm mechanical properties Lac21E ( 5 m M , 6 . 5 ml ) in HEPES buffer at pH 3 . 0 or 7 . 0 was ﬁlled into a polytetraﬂuoroethylene bath forming part of the CIT . The ﬁlm was aged for 60 min before being subjected to initial tension – compression cycles to 5 and 300 % strain . To switch a preformed interface , a small volume of 1 N HCl or NaOH , sufﬁcient to adjust the pH to the desired ﬁnal value , was added to the bath by pipetting beneath the T - pieces , and the ﬁlm was allowed to age a further 120 min before the tension – compression cycles were repeated . 2 . 2 . Interfacial tension Air bubbles ( approx . 8 m l ) were formed via a U - shaped needle in a quartz Hellma cuvette ( 8 ml ) containing a solution of Lac21E ( 5 m M ) in 25 mM HEPES at pH 3 . 0 or 7 . 4 under magnetic stirring . The bubble shape was monitored automatically over 10 min to follow changes in the interfacial tension ( DSA - 10 , Kru¨ss , Hamburg , Germany ) . For switching experiments , a small aliquot of NaOH or HCl was added to the cuvette to switch the pH rapidly between 3 and 7 . 4 . Control experiments on buffer in the absence of peptide showed a stable interfacial tension close to 73 mN m K 1 . 2 . 3 . Foam switching Lac21E ( 100 nmol ) was dissolved in 1 . 0 ml of 10 mM HEPES ( pH 3 . 0 ) and transferred into a custom - made foam preparation apparatus . A foam of approximately 6 . 5 cm height was formed by passing air ( 7 ml ) through the peptide solution via a sintered glass disc . The foam was allowed to stand for 5 min during which time slight foam coarsening , but insigniﬁcant alteration in foam height , was noted . An aliquot ( 8 m l ) of NaOH ( 1 . 0 N ) was added to the top of the foam , causing foam collapse within 60 s . A new foam of approximately 6 . 5 cm height was prepared from the neutralized peptide solution ( pH 7 . 0 ) by the passage of air as explained above . The foam was unstable and collapsed within 60 s . 2 . 4 . Neutron reﬂectivity Neutron reﬂection experiments were performed using the SURF reﬂectometer , a time - of - ﬂight instrument at Rutherford Appleton Laboratory ( ISIS , Oxfordshire , UK ; wavelength 0 . 55 – 6 . 8 A˚ corresponding to a momen - tum transfer between 0 . 048 and 0 . 6 A˚ K 1 at an incident angle of 1 . 5 8 ) . Peptide solution ( 5 m M in 25 mM HEPES buffer , pH 3 . 0 or 7 . 4 , in the presence of 100 m M ZnSO 4 or 100 m M EDTA ) was added to a Teﬂon trough and aged for 1 . 5 – 6 h before measurement .

Together with selective deuteration of peptides , contrast variation was carried out by using a HEPES buffer with four different D 2 O / H 2 O ratios ( 8 . 1 , 39 . 1 , 70 and 100 % ( v / v ) D 2 O ) . Reﬂectivity data were calibrated to an absolute scale using pure D 2 O standard and are presented in the electronic supplementary material . The average reﬂec - tivity between 0 . 27 and 0 . 6 A˚ K 1 was taken as back - ground and subtracted from each reﬂectivity curve . Peptide molecular volume was calculated from the partial speciﬁc volume of amino acids ( Jacrot & Zaccai 1981 ) taking into account the contribution of N - terminal peptide acetylation and C - terminal amida - tion . Scattering length was calculated from the chemical composition of peptides ( Jacrot & Zaccai 1981 ) . Exchange of labile peptide hydrogens with solvent was considered to be complete before reﬂectiv - ity measurement . A model of two sub - layers was used to represent the peptide ﬁlm at the interface , with each sub - layer described by a Gaussian ( Lu et al . 1996 ) . The solvent proﬁle at the interface was described by an improved solvent distribution function ( Penfold & Thomas 2002 ) . Assuming that a peptide in protonated and deuterated form has identical chemical structure under different D 2 O / H 2 O ratios , the detailed structure of a peptide ﬁlm was obtained by simultaneously ﬁtting the data at different contrast variations . Goodness of ﬁt is shown in the electronic supplementary material . 3 . RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Although peptide adsorption at interfaces has been extensively researched ( Middelberg et al . 2000 ; Jones & Middelberg 2002 b ; Lu et al . 2003 , 2004 ; Sjogren & Ulvenlund 2004 ) , only AM1 ( Dexter et al . 2006 ) has , to date , been reported to act as a switchable peptide surfactant . The surprising ﬁnding that AM1 could switch the stability of a foam or emulsion , in seconds and without a signiﬁcant change in interfacial tension , stimulated us to characterize the interface using neutron reﬂectometry . To the best of our knowledge , neutron reﬂectometry has been used onlyonce before to probe the adsorption of small well - deﬁned peptide sequences at the air – water interface ( Lu et al . 2003 ) . In that study , a 14 - residue non - switchable b - hairpin peptide adsorbed at the air – water interface gave an area per molecule of 210 A ˚ 2 and a peptide Gaussian layer thickness of approximately 10 A˚ . Deuteration was not used in that study to obtain high - resolution information on amino acid location , the layer was not switchable , and its mechanical properties were not determined . Figure 2 shows neutron reﬂectometry results for peptide AM1 self - assembled at the air – water interface , under conditions shown previously to create a mechani - cally strong ﬁlm ( interfacial elasticity , E ! t of 120 mN m K 1 and maximum interfacial tensile stress of 6 . 9 mN m K 1 ) which is able to stabilize an emulsion or foam ( Dexter et al . 2006 ) . All valine and leucine residues in the 21 - residue AM1 sequence were deuter - ated , allowing contrast matching to reveal different molecular features ( Fragneto et al . 1995 ; Strzalka et al . 2004 ) . Data were described using a two - sub - layer hydrophilic – hydrophobic Gaussian model , with an allowance for roughness of the water surface ( Lu & Thomas 1998 ; Penfold & Thomas 2002 ) . An area per molecule of 380 G 15 A˚ 2 , a volume fraction of 55 G 5 % and sub - layer thicknesses of 9 G 2 A˚ for the hydrophobic component , and 12 A˚ for the hydrophilic component , were determined . The data indicate a spatial separation of the hydrophobic and hydrophilic amino acids in the peptide sequence . Deuterated leucine and valine residues partitioned to the air phase , such that the hydrophobic and hydrophilic layers were separated by 7 . 5 A˚ or slightly less than the full diameter of an a - helix ( approx . 10 A˚ ) . These results suggest that AM1 folds into an a - helix during interfacial self - assembly ( ﬁgure 3 ) , creating a thin ordered layer at the air – water interface . The formation of an ordered ﬁlm at the soft interface occurs even though the peptide has a random coil conformation in bulk solution at the concentration used , as assessed by circular dichroism ( data not shown ) . The interface imparts a dominant ordering effect that allows individual peptides to interact in such a way that a thin , but strong , interfacial ﬁlm is formed . The mechanical properties of the AM1 thin ﬁlm have been quantitatively determined by direct stress – strain measurement , in situ and in the plane of the interface , using the CIT ( ﬁgure 1 ; Dexter et al . 2006 ) . Previous studies using the CIT ( Jones & Middelberg 2002 a – c , 2003 ; Dexter et al . 2006 ; Malcolm et al . 2006 a ) do not report an experimental Young’s modulus for interfacial ﬁlms , as direct measures of ﬁlm thickness were not available . In this study , neutron reﬂectometry provides information on interfacial structure and thickness . From ﬁgure 2 , thickness can be estimated as t Z 15 . 0 A˚ by taking the peak width at half maximum height while recognizing that the distribution is non - symmetric . This result , coupled with the measured interfacial modulus of 120 mN m K 1 , allows a Young modulus of E Z 80 MPa to be calculated . This quantitative result is consistent with estimates for other biological materials such as peptide ﬁbres ( 1 – 20 MPa ; Leon et al . 1998 ) , collagen ﬁbres in buffer ( 200 – 500 MPa ; van der Rijt et al . 2006 ) and the wall of the yeast cell ( 100 – 130 MPa ; Smith et al . 2000 a , b ) . To the best of our knowledge , this result represents the ﬁrst in situ experimental determination of the Young modulus of a biological material self - assembled at a soft interface and has been performed on a molecularly thin ﬁlm . We next addressed the question of whether the characteristics of the interfacial ﬁlm changed substan - tially when the array was in the ‘off’ state ( i . e . when a mechanically weak ﬁlm exists at the interface ) . While restructuring is known for peptides following self - assembly at an interface , the extent and nature of interfacial ordering or disordering is highly dependent on the sequence of amino acids in the peptide , the nature of the interface ( hard or soft ) and the physico - chemical conditions of self - assembly ( Degrado & Lear 1985 ; Holt et al . 2002 ; Lu et al . 2004 ; Henderson et al . 2005 ; Rapaport 2006 ) . Therefore , we repeated the neutron reﬂectometry study for an AM1 ﬁlm assembled at the air – water interface in the off state ( in the presence of the chelating agent EDTA ) and found a very slight but insigniﬁcant 50 The properties of switchable peptide ﬁlms A . P . J . Middelberg et al . J . R . Soc . Interface ( 2008 ) decrease in molecular density ( molecular area increased to 390 A˚ 2 , volume fraction decreased to 54 % and ﬁlm thickness decreased to 14 . 6 A˚ ) . In the off state , the ﬁlm has an interfacial elasticity of less than 30 mN m K 1 and a maximum interfacial tensile stress of 0 . 5 mN m K 1 ( Dexter et al . 2006 ) , giving a Young modulus of less than 20 MPa . Neutron reﬂectometry of deuterated peptide conﬁrmed the structure of the interfacial ﬁlm whichwasalmostidenticaltothatassembledinthe‘on’orhigh - elasticity state ( data not shown ) ; in both states the ﬁlm comprised a thin layer of peptide having clear separation of the hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions . For AM1 it can be concluded that a change in the in - plane interactions , rather than interfacial depopula - tion or rearrangement , leads to the transition from high - to low Young’s modulus . This ﬁnding supports our proposal that , for AM1 , it is the existence of a mechanically strong ﬁlm at the interface , rather than the density or thickness of the peptide ﬁlm , that is important for foam stabilization . It appears that the air – water interface imparts a dominant ordering effect on AM1 , which has the classic 4 , 3 hydrophobic repeat characteristic of coiled coils ( Cohen & Parry 1990 ; Kohn & Hodges 1998 ) . Crick ( 1952 , 1953 ) showed that some coiled coil architectures adopt a ‘knobs - in - holes’ geometry whereby the hydro - phobic side chains from one helix pack into holes between side chains on an associated helix , thus minimizing the contact of hydrophobic residues with water . Other non - hydrophobic residues in the sequence drive inter - peptide interactions , for example by ion pairs ( Cohen & Parry 1990 ; Kohn & Hodges 1998 ) . At the air – water interface the hydrophobic driver for self - assembly is retained . However , the interface imposes less steric constraint and so the conformational entropy ( Lee et al . 2000 ) of the hydrophobic side chains is higher than when packed in a constrained hole . Consequently , the hydrophobic driver of AM1 self - assembly may stabilize peptide ordering independently of whether or not adjacent peptides interact with each other , for example through ion - pair interactions ( Cohen & Parry 1990 ; Kohn & Hodges 1998 ) or , in the case of AM1 , switchable metal ion coordination ( Ruben et al . 2004 ; Dexter et al . 2006 ) . This interfacial uncoupling of the energies of interfacial ordering and peptide – peptide interaction makes it possible to have AM1 interfacial ﬁlms that are similarly populated , but which display very different mechanical properties . We next asked whether changes in the amino acid sequence of the peptide would alter the mechanism of ﬁlm switching . Could we develop or discover a peptide which assembles a concentrated and precisely ordered ﬁlm , similar to AM1 , but which switches by changing the interfacial peptide concentration ? The peptide Lac21E ( Ac - MEELADS LEELARQ VEELESA - NH 2 ) contains a high content of carboxylate residues and is closely related to the AM1 parent sequence Lac21 ( Fairman et al . 1996 ) . Figure 4 shows rapid switching of interfacial tension with Lac21E as a function of pH . At freshly formed interface , with a bulk solution pH of 3 , the peptide adsorbed to give an interfacial tension of 43 mN m K 1 at 140 s in a stirred cell . Addition of NaOH to adjust the pH to 7 . 4 ( arrow ) gave a rapid increase in interfacial tension to 69 mN m K 1 as the peptide desorbed from the interface . Reacidiﬁcation ( arrow ) lowered the interfacial tension to 45 mN m K 1 as the peptide readsorbed . A second cycle of switching gave similar results . We probed the strength of the interfacial ﬁlm under both conditions using the CIT ( ﬁgure 5 ) . An interfacial ﬁlm assembled from Lac21E at pH 3 showed an interfacial elasticity of 430 mN m K 1 and a maximum interfacial stress of 17 . 5 mN m K 1 . On addition of sufﬁcient NaOH to adjust the bulk solution to pH 7 . 4 , followed by re - equilibration of the interface , the mechanical strength of the interface was lost ( interfacial elasticity 5 mN m K 1 and maximum interfacial stress 0 . 3 mN m K 1 ) . Subsequent addition of HCl to return the solution pH to 3 restored the original mechanical properties ( interfacial elasticity 380 mN m K 1 and maxi - mum interfacial stress 18 . 1 mN m K 1 ) .

Middelberg et al . 51 J . R . Soc . Interface ( 2008 ) conditions that lead to a strong interfacial ﬁlm as reported previously for AM1 ( Malcolm et al . 2006 a ) . We directly determined the structure of the interfacial Lac21E ﬁlm , using neutron reﬂectometry of deuterated Lac21E , as already done for AM1 . The interfacial area per molecule of 1400 G 200 A˚ 2 was signiﬁcantly higher at neutral pH than at acid pH ( 330 G 10 A˚ 2 ) . The corresponding volume fractions at the interface were 17 and 70 % , respectively . The Lac21E reversible switch operates by the dissociation of peptide from the interfacial ﬁlm , in a very different way to the mechanism for AM1 , and is consistent with the peptides being highly charged at neutral pH . In this case , loss of the strong state is accompanied by a decrease in interfacial molecular density ; the peptides transfer back into the bulk aqueous solution in a process of self - disassembly . Figure 7 shows the interfacial structure at pH 3 , where the strong ﬁlm is formed . The result closely resembles the structure of the AM1 ﬁlm ( ﬁgure 2 ) suggesting that Lac21E , like AM1 , is precisely organized into an interfacial layer of interacting a - helical peptides . In this case , the layer thickness is estimated as 12 . 8 A˚ , giving an initial Young’s modulus of E Z 335 MPa , switching to E ! 4 MPa . This high modulus in the populated ‘on’ state is stronger than that of the AM1 ﬁlm ( 80 MPa ) , most probably as a consequence of sequence differences and the higher peptide concentration at the interface ( 70 % volume fraction for Lac21E compared with 55 % for AM1 ) . The Lac21E modulus is comparable to that reported for collagen ﬁbres ( 200 – 500 MPa ; van der Rijt et al . 2006 ) , which comprise a dense nanostructure of interacting helices . These results suggest an upper limit for the Young modulus of hydrated biomaterials compris - ing interacting peptide or protein helices and a signiﬁcant dependence of modulus on peptide concentration . Neutron reﬂectometry coupled with deuteration of selected amino acids has provided a unique insight into the detailed structure of switchable interfacial ﬁlms . Both AM1 and Lac21E create thin but remarkably strong ﬁlms with neutron reﬂectivity suggesting , but not proving , ordered folding of the peptides into interacting a - helices . The molecular areas in populated states are similar for both peptides ( 18 A˚ 2 per residue for AM1 and 16 A˚ 2 for Lac21E ) and are consistent with earlier reports for non - switchable b - hairpin peptides at the air – water interface ( 15 A˚ 2 / residue , Lu et al . 2003 ) and for peptides adsorbed at solid interfaces ( 15 – 17 A˚ 2 , Lu et al . 2004 ; Strzalka et al . 2004 ) . This interfacial ordering occurs despite the fact that the peptide surfactant has random - coil characteristics in bulk solution as assessed by circular dichroism ( data not shown ) . 4 . CONCLUSIONS Neutron reﬂectometry has provided detailed infor - mation on the organization of interfacial ﬁlms that self - assemble from aqueous peptide solutions to give structures that can be reversibly switched between an ‘on’ state having high elasticity and an ‘off’ state where the ﬁlm is weaker . For peptide AM1 , the interfacial ﬁlm structure and concentration are almost the same in both states , and the reﬂectivity proﬁle is consistent with a thin but ordered layer of interacting a - helices . Experimental determination of the AM1 ﬁlm thickness ( approx . 15 A˚ ) allowed the Young modulus of the interfacial ﬁlm to be calculated ( 80 MPa in the ‘on’ state and less than 20 MPa in the ‘off’ state ) . To the best of our knowledge , this result , obtained for a molecularly thin ﬁlm , represents the ﬁrst experimental determination of the Young modulus of a biological ﬁlm self - assembled at a soft interface . Previous results have shown that AM1 stabilizes emulsions and foams in the high - elasticity state , but not when the ﬁlm is weak . This result , coupled with the current ﬁnding that the interfacial structure does not signiﬁcantly change when switched , suggests a fundamental link between the Young modulus of the interfacial ﬁlm and the macro - scopic stability of foam , and possibly emulsions , formed using peptide surfactants . We also studied a second designed peptide , Lac21E , which also switches between ‘on’ and ‘off’ states . Unlike AM1 , the reduction in Young’s modulus for Lac21E , from 335 MPa to less than 4 MPa , following a pH trigger , is caused by very ( a ) 5min ( b ) ( c ) 1min weak film strong film Figure 6 . Rapid modulation of the stability of a Lac21E - stabilized foam by changes in pH . A foam prepared from a Lac21E solution at pH 3 . 0 ( a ) was stable on standing for 5 min . After ( b ) , adjustment of the pH to 7 . 0 , the foam collapsed completely within 1 min ( not shown ) and a new foam was prepared which ( c ) collapsed completely in 1 min . 1 . 0 0 . 8 0 . 6 0 . 4 0 . 2 0 – 10 0 10 20 distance normal to interface ( Å ) vo l u m e fr ac ti on Figure 7 . Structure of the Lac21E ﬁlm at the air – water interface determined by neutron reﬂectometry of deuterated peptide . The overall peptide volume distribution ( black line ) comprises hydrophobic ( yellow line ) and hydrophilic ( cyan line ) distributions ; surface roughness is represented by a distribution of water density ( blue line ) . The ﬁlm was formed under conditions where the interface is strongly populated ( 5 m M deuterated Lac21E in 25 mM HEPES buffer at pH 3 ) . 52 The properties of switchable peptide ﬁlms A . P . J . Middelberg et al . J . R . Soc . Interface ( 2008 ) substantial transfer of peptide from the interfacial ﬁlm back into the aqueous bulk ( i . e . by self - disassembly ) . Nevertheless , neutron reﬂectometry using deuterated peptide conﬁrmed that the structure of the Lac21E strong ﬁlm is very similar to that formed by AM1 . The extent of foam destabilization following the pH trigger is also similar . Lac21E and AM1 allow the surfactant effect to be switched off by either depopulation of the interface ( Lac21E ) or by disconnection of the peptides within the interfacial ﬁlm ( AM1 ) . This complementarity of mechanism in closely related peptides potentially allows independent speciﬁcation of both interfacial strength and interfacial tension in basic soft - matter studies and suggests that conventional DLVO stabil - ization mechanisms do not fully describe the properties of peptide - covered soft interfaces . These molecular tools therefore have the potential to enable new fundamental insights in emulsions and foams , by drawing on the richness of the amino acid toolkit to design unique interfacial structures . Knowledge gained by their scientiﬁc study may motivate a search for new bio - inspired switchable surfactants and a more complete understanding of the mechanisms governing foam and emulsion stability .
