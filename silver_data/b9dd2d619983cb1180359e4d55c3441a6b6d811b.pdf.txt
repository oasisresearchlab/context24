Several limiting aspects have already been discussed ; however , still , no data have shown how specific AFM probe geometries are related to the biomechanical evalua - tion of cancer cells . Here , we analyze and compare the nanomechanical results of mechanically homogenous polyacrylamide gels and heterogeneous bladder cancer cells measured using AFM probes of various tip geometry , including symmetric and non - symmetric pyramids and a sphere . Our observations show large modulus variability aligned with both types of AFM probes used and with the internal structure of the cells . Altogether , these results demonstrate that it is possible to differ - entiate between compliant and rigid samples of kPa elasticity ; however , simultaneously , they highlight the strong need for standardized protocols for AFM - based elasticity measurements if applied in clinical practice including the use of a single type of AFM cantilever . Keywords Atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) · Cancer cell mechanics · Indenter geometry Introduction The biological functionality of cells and tissues is strongly correlated with their nanomechanical properties , usually quantified by Young’s modulus—a physical parameter describing the material’s resistance to elastic deformations ( Sneddon 1965 ) . One of the tools for studying cell mechan - ics in conditions close to physiological ones is atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) . In most cases , for the data recorded using AFM - based force spectroscopy , Young’s modulus is evaluated in the frame of Hertz contact mechanics , which describes the deformation ( indentation ) of two purely elas - tic spheres . The model can be extended into a case when a stiff sphere indents an infinitely thick , isotropic and elastic half - space in the absence of adhesion within the contact area ( Hertz 1881 ) . Sneddon’s modifications resolved the problem of indenter geometry by solving the Boussinesq problem , i . e . , finding the elastic state in a linearly elas - tic isotropic half - space , subjected to a concentrated load applied in a point of its boundary plane and perpendicular to it , assuming various axisymmetric geometries of the indenters of various shapes ( Sneddon 1965 ) . One of the main requirements in AFM is that sample height should be large enough to provide conditions avoiding the influ - ence of the underlying stiff supports . This implies that the indentation depth should be below c . a . 10 % of the sample height . Furthermore , a typical shape of the probing tip is a four - sided pyramid that is approximated either by a cone or paraboloid ( Schillers et al . 2017 ) . Although more relevant , less frequently , a Hertz contact model with the extension for the four - sided pyramidal indenter geometry is used ( Weber et al . 2019 ) . The use of spherical indent - ers to data collected with a spherical AFM probe does not introduce a large discrepancy ( Lin and Horkay 2008 ; Kim et al . 2013 ; Guz et al . 2014 ; Puricelli et al . 2016 ) . Instead discrepancies arise in the case of data recorded with pyramidal probes ( Radmacher 2007 ; Sirghi et al . * Joanna Zemła Joanna . Zemla @ ifj . edu . pl * Małgorzata Lekka Malgorzata .

A single cell cannot be treated as a purely elastic mate - rial as various studies show its viscoelastic nature ( e . g . , Nawaz et al . 2012 ) . However , despite the ongoing devel - opment in the modeling of the mechanical properties of single cells , the Hertz contact theory is still dominant and widely employed in AFM - based data analysis due to its simplicity . As a consequence , measurements of relative Young’s modulus are used to quantify changes in biologi - cal samples ( relativeness of the elastic modulus for bio - logical samples has been discussed in Lekka et al . 2012 ; Lekka 2016 ) . In the majority of pathological conditions , cells alter mechanical properties as has been reported for cancer ( Lekka et al . 1999 , 2012 ; Faria et al . 2008 ; Prab - hune et al . 2012 ; Ketene et al . 2012 ; Kim et al . 2013 ; Chiou et al . 2013 ; Ramos et al . 2014 ; Zhao et al . 2015 ; Lekka 2016 ; Rianna and Radmacher 2016 ; Alibert et al . 2017 ) . So far , only a few papers have reported on the effect of probe shape on the determined Young’s modu - lus ( Rico et al . 2005 ; Chiou et al . 2013 ; Kim et al . 2013 ; Lekka 2016 ; Managuli and Roy 2017 ; Alcaraz et al . 2017 ; Sokolov and Dokukin 2017 ) . Reported results indicate that cells probed with cantilevers possessing pyramidal tips mounted at the free end reveal larger elastic moduli ( cells seem to be more rigid ) as compared to measurements car - ried out on the same cell type with spherical probes ( Rico et al . 2005 ; Carl and Schillers 2008 ; Managuli and Roy 2017 ; Alcaraz et al . 2017 ; Sokolov and Dokukin 2017 ; Jorba et al . 2017 ; Giménez et al . 2017 ) . In most cases , a comparison was carried out for one cell type such as Chinese hamster ovary cells ( Carl and Schillers 2008 ) or fibroblasts ( Chiou et al . 2013 ) ; thus , it still is not clear how probe geometry affects the nanomechanics - based identifi - cation of cancer cells . This is important for improving the diagnostic significance of AFM - based elasticity measure - ments , especially given that the absolute value of Young’s modulus is difficult to obtain . Our earlier measurements have revealed that human bladder cancer cells are signifi - cantly more deformable as compared to non - malignant bladder cancer cells ( Lekka et al . 1999 , 2019 ; Ramos et al . 2014 ) . Therefore , we have chosen two cell lines , namely , HCV29 ( non - malignant cell cancer of ureter ) , and HT1376 ( bladder carcinoma ) for this study . Importantly , these cells are characterized by a distinct organization of actin fila - ments , as the main cytoskeletal component responsible for the elastic properties of the cells ( Ketene et al . 2012 ; Ramos et al . 2014 ) . Non - malignant cells have a well - organized actin cytoskeleton with developed thick , long fibers accompanied by short thin filaments . Carcinoma HT1376 cells display only short actin filaments ( Lekka et al . 2019 ) . Observed differences in actin cytoskeleton make these cells suitable as a cellular model to quantify differences in cellular deformability using indenters of various geometries . In our studies , we compare nanomechanical properties of soft samples ( polyacrylamide hydrogels and cells ) based on measurements carried out with AFM probes of various tip geometry , including symmetric and non - symmetric pyra - mids and a sphere . Our findings show the tip shape - depend - ent variability of Young’s modulus ; however , while working within the range of moduli characteristic for living cells , it is still possible to differentiate between compliant and rigid samples . Simultaneously , these results highlight the need for standardized protocols in choosing cantilever type if applied in clinical practice . Materials and methods Coverslips for hydrogels deposition and polymerization Bottom coverslips ( Ø15 mm , Thermo Scientific ) were soni - cated in acetone , subsequently rinsed with dH 2 O , and dried . Afterward , they were placed in a vacuum desiccator for 1 h and 3 - aminopropyltriethoxysilane ( APTES , Sigma - Aldrich ) vapor deposition occurred . Then , the slides were immersed in 0 . 5 % glutaraldehyde ( GA , Sigma - Aldrich ) in deion - ized water for an hour and dried . Top coverslips ( Ø22 mm , Thermo Scientific ) were coated with 5 % SurfaSil Solution ( Sigma - Aldrich ) in acetone for 10 s and subsequently rinsed in acetone and methanol and dried . Polyacrylamide gels Stock solutions of 40 % acrylamide ( Sigma - Aldrich ) and 2 % bis - acrylamide ( Sigma - Aldrich ) prepared in dH2O were used to make polyacrylamide gel ( PA ) precursor solutions . Polyacrylamide water solutions ( 1 ml total volume ) with final acrylamide concentration of 5 % and 7 % were prepared by mixing 125 μl and 175 μl of acrylamide precursor solu - tion with 200 μl of bis - acrylamide ( bis - A ) precursor solution ( 0 . 4 % ) , respectively . Before crosslinking , initiator ( 10 μl of 10 % ammonium persulfate water solution ) and accelera - tor ( 1 . 5 μl of tetramethylethylenediamine ( TEMED , Fisher Scientific ) were added to the polyacrylamide solutions and degassed in a vacuum desiccator . Then , after gentle mixing with the pipette , 60 μl drop of the final solution was placed on a bottom coverslip and covered with a SurfaSil modified coverslip , which was removed after 20 min polymerization time . Polyacrylamide gels were placed in dH 2 O and stored at a temperature of 4 °C prior to examination . Two samples per each case were prepared in one batch for the AFM meas - urements ( in total 30 – 40 elasticity maps were recorded per each case ) . This approach resulted from the fact that there European Biophysics Journal 1 3 might be discrepancies in the mechanical properties of PA gels among different batches , although the same prepara - tion protocol is used ( Denisin and Pruitt 2016 ) . The reason for choosing these acrylamide concentrations was to obtain gel samples characterized by a similar range of Young’s modulus as cells are . The thickness of PA gel samples was 1 – 2 mm . Cell cultures Two human cell lines were chosen for the study , i . e . , non - malignant cell cancer of ureter ( HCV29 , Institute of Exper - imental Therapy , Wrocław , Poland ) and urinary bladder carcinoma cell line ( HT1376 , grade III , ATCC , LGC Stand - ards ) . HCV29 cells were cultured in RPMI - 1640 ( Sigma ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS , Sigma ) and HT1376 cell line was cultured in Eagle’s medium ( EMEM , LGC Standards ) supplemented with 10 % FBS ( LGC Standards ) . The cells were grown on glass coverslips placed inside the polystyrene Petri dish at 37 °C in 95 % air / 5 % CO 2 atmosphere . The relative humidity was kept above 98 % . For elasticity maps , HCV29 cells were grown in the tissue culture dish ( Ø34 mm , TPP ® ) . The AFM meas - urements were carried out after 48 h culture , in the corre - sponding media , at room temperature . With each cantilever type , ~ 30 individual cells were measured . The height of the cells within the nuclear region was about 7 – 10 μ . AFM‑based force spectroscopy Force spectroscopy measurements were conducted using XE120 AFM ( Park Systems , South Korea ) equipped with a liquid cell setup . Various silicon nitride cantile - vers with mounted probing tips of diverse geometries were employed . They can be divided into three groups , namely , ( i ) symmetric pyramidal probes ( MSCT - AUH , Veeco ; customized PNP , Nanosensors ; OTR4 , Bruker ) ; ( ii ) non - symmetric pyramidal probes ( MSNL & MLCT , Bruker ) ; and ( iii ) a pyrex - nitride colloidal probes ( sQube , CP - PNP - SiO - C - 5 , NanoAndMore ) . Nominal values of half open - angles , cantilever spring constants , and radii of curvature are included in Table 1 . Spring constants of the cantilevers were calibrated using the thermal noise method in the air ( Schillers et al . 2017 ) . Photodetector sensitiv - ity , i . e . , the inverse of the slope , was obtained by fitting a line to the slope of the force curve acquired on the stiff substrate ( glass or Petri dish ) . Measurements were con - ducted on PA gels and cells . Both cells and PA gels were measured with the same cantilevers . Force curves were recorded within a scan area of 6 μm × 6 μm , within which a grid of 8 × 8 points was set . In total , 64 force curves were acquired ( in the case of cells , a nuclear region was probed ) . The force – distance curves were recorded at an approach velocity of 8 μm / s , the maximum force of 7 nN , and a force curve length of 4 μm . Young’s modulus determination Individual force curve is a relation between a cantilever deflection and a relative scanner position . The deflection of the cantilever is converted into a force by multiplying it by cantilever spring constant . An indentation depth is obtained by subtracting a calibration curve recorded on a stiff non - deformable surface ( Fig . 1a ) . This requires the knowledge of the position of the contact point . In this study , we used eye inspection convoluted with fitting a horizontal line to the baseline ; therefore , indentations lower than 100 nm are not considered during the analysis . The obtained force - versus - indentation curves were then fitted to the Hertz model ( Lekka et al . 1999 ; Schillers et al . 2017 ) . In our study , AFM probes with four - sided geometry were approximated by a cone . In such a case , the relation between the load force ( F ) and the indentation depth ( δ ) is Table 1 Characteristic parameters of one set of AFM probes used in the experiment Opening angle ( i . e . , back angle , α ) , height ( h ) , the radius of curvature ( R ) , and sphere diameter ( Ø ) were estimated based on SEM images with an accuracy of 1 % * n = 3 ; * * error is the half - width taken at half height ; * * * standard deviation Cantilever h [ μm ] h nom [ μm ] α nom [ ° ] ( R [ nm ] ) α SEM [ ° ] ν nom [ kHz ] ν meas [ kHz ] * k nom [ N / m ] k meas [ N / m ] * MLCT 4 . 49 2 . 5 – 8 . 0 23 ( 20 ) 23 7 8 . 28 ± 0 . 03 * * 0 . 01 0 . 014 ± 0 . 001 * * * MSNL 4 . 40 2 . 5 – 8 . 0 22 . 5 ( 2 ) 23 7 8 . 27 ± 0 . 02 0 . 01 0 . 014 ± 0 . 001 PNP customized 3 . 31 3 . 5 36 ( 40 ) 37 13 16 . 09 ± 0 . 21 0 . 03 0 . 054 ± 0 . 014 OTR 4 3 . 09 2 . 5 – 3 . 5 36 ( 15 ) 37 11 12 . 23 ± 0 . 05 0 . 02 0 . 025 ± 0 . 002 MSCT 3 . 13 2 . 5 – 8 . 0 36 ( 20 ) 37 8 8 . 27 ± 0 . 02 0 . 01 0 . 014 ± 0 . 001 Cantilever h [ μm ] h nom [ μm ] Ø nom [ µm ] Ø SEM [ μm ] ν nom [ kHz ] ν meas [ kHz ] * k nom [ N / m ] k meas [ N / m ] * sQube – – 6 . 62 6 . 4 17 16 . 22 ± 0 . 36 0 . 08 0 . 046 ± 0 . 002 European Biophysics Journal 1 3 where α is the open - angle of the cone . For a sphere of radius R , the following equation was applied : E eff is the reduced Young’s modulus given by When E sample < < E tip , the following relationship can be obtained : ( 1 ) F ( 𝛿 ) = 2 𝜋 tan ( 𝛼 ) E eﬀ 𝛿 2 , ( 2 ) F ( 𝛿 ) = 4 3 √ RE eﬀ 𝛿 32 . ( 3 ) 1 E eﬀ = 1 − 𝜇 2tip E tip + 1 − 𝜇 2sample E sample . ( 4 ) E eﬀ = E sample 1 − 𝜇 2sample , where µ sample and µ tip are Poisson’s ratio related to the com - pressibility of the sample and indenting tip . In our analysis , we set Poisson’s ratio to 0 . 5 for both polyacrylamide gels and cells assuming that these samples are incompressible . The apparent Young’s modulus was calculated by fitting a Gauss function to moduli distribu - tions ( Fig . 1b presents an exemplary histogram obtained for a 5 % PA sample measured with OTR4 AFM probe ) . The center of the distribution denotes the mean value , while the standard deviation is determined from the distribution width . Figure 1c shows the variability of elastic modulus present within the recorded scan area of 6 μ . Obtaining the relation between Young’s modulus and indentation depths In our analysis , we calculated the Young’s modulus as a function of indentation depth varied within a range of 100 – 700 nm , with a step of 50 nm . Indentation depth below 100 nm was omitted to a possible effect of a misdefined Fig . 1 a Schematic illustra - tion of AFM - based elasticity measurements carried out for soft samples . Young’s modulus is derived from force - versus - indentation curves being the subtraction results of reference ( stiff ; glass coverslip surface ) and sample ( soft ; cells or polyacrylamide hydrogels ) force curves . b Exemplary histogram showing Young’s modulus distribution obtained for ( 5 % PA / 0 . 4 % bis - A ) hydrogel sample probes over a squared scan area of 6 µm × 6 µm ( n = 64 force curves ; sam - pling interval Δ E = 0 . 5 kPa ) ; measured with OTR4 probe .

Starting from the contact point , the Hertz model was fitted to a fragment of the force curve corresponding to a specific indentation ( Fig . 1d ) . The shape of the indenting tip defines the relationship between a load force and indentation depth . The cone ( or pyramid ) predicts F = B · δ 2 , while for the sphere ( or paraboloid ) , F = A · δ 3 / 2 . Both A and B can be re - written in a form c · E , where c is the constant including all the geometrical information together with the Poisson’s ratio and E is Young’s modulus ( Weber et al . 2019 ) . Frequently , real data recorded during cell indentation rarely fully follow these relations . To elaborate more precisely how the diver - gence of fitting data with both relations affects the fitting parameters , experimental points ( δ n , F n ) in the force – inden - tation curve can be assumed to follow : F n = A · δ n 2− ε and δ n = n · δ 0 , where δ 0 is the indentation difference between adjacent points , n is the number of points , y n is the load force corresponding to the indentation δ n , A is the fitting param - eter proportional to Young’s modulus , and ε is the value expressing how much the cone ( or pyramid ) approximation differs from the experimental curve . The fitted parameter B can be calculated from F n = B · δ n 2 . For N experimental points recorded up to chosen maximum indentation : Thus , the larger N ( i . e . fitting data for larger indentation ) will generate the lower fitted B value ( Fig . 1e ) . Analogously , in the case of spherical ( or paraboloidal ) assumption of the indenter , the fitted parameter C follows the relation : The C value increases with the data size to be fitted ( for larger N , the higher fitted C is obtained , Fig . 1e ) . Depend - ing on the theoretical model , the divergence ε was calcu - lated . It shows how much the obtained data differs from the assumed theoretical model ( cone or paraboloid ) . In our case , the choosing a cone as an approximation of the AFM tip shape induces its smaller deviations ( Fig . 1f ) . Elasticity mapping Elasticity maps of cells were acquired with the use of JPK AFM equipped with NanoWizard 4 head by employ - ing a classical force volume mode . Rectangular cantilever ORC8 with nominal spring constant k = 0 . 05 N / m , nomi - nal resonance frequency f nom = 18 kHz , opening half - angle α = 36° , and nominal tip radius of 15 nm were used .

( 6 ) C = A ⋅ 𝛿 − 𝜀 0 ⋅ ∑ Nn = 0 𝛿 n 3 − 𝜀 ∑ Nn = 0 𝛿 n 3 . choose ORC8 instead of OTR4 as these cantilevers seems to be more stable when long force volume measurements are conducted . The AFM tip shape of OTR4 and ORC8 is the same . Due to cell heterogeneity , the size of maps varied between 45 µm × 45 µm and 50 μm × 50 μm , but , always , a size of a single - pixel kept being 1 µm 2 . Elasticity maps were recorded with the approach / retract speed of 8 μm / s and load force 10 nN . The time needed to record a single map varied from 45 to 70 min . Scanning electron microscopy The SEM images of the used cantilevers were recorded using the FEI Quanta FEG - SEM in low vacuum conditions . The electron beam was operating at 5 kV accelerating voltage , 5 nA current , and a working distance of about 5 mm . Images of AFM tips were captured using the secondary electrons signal for only one set of cantilevers ( one image per one cantilever ) . Statistical analysis All calculations and statistical analyses were performed using OriginPro 2015 . Data are represented as the mean ± standard error obtained from all measurements . Statistical significance was evaluated using two - sample Student’s t test for testing the equality of the means between two populations , assuming various numbers of samples ana - lyzed ( using OriginPro 2015 ) . All statistical tests were two - sided and p values of < 0 . 05 were considered statistically significant . Results and discussion Geometrical and mechanical properties of AFM probes AFM probes chosen for our study were non - symmetric ( MLCT , MSNL ) and symmetric ( PNP , MSCT , OTR4 ) pyramidal probes . As a reference , a spherical probe ( sQube ) was used . The geometry of probes ( Fig . 2 ) was visualized using scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) . Based on SEM images , the main parameters describing probe geometry , i . e . , height , opening angle , and sphere radius , were determined with 1 % accuracy . The height of symmetric pyramids was about 3 µm while non - symmetric ones were characterized by a height of about 4 μm . The radius of spherical probes used was found to be 3 . 31 ± 0 . 03 µm corresponding to a height of about 6 . 4 µm ( Table 1 ) . Spring constants of the cantilevers were calibrated using the thermal noise method in the air . For each cantilever , the resonant frequency was recorded with an accuracy below 2 . 5 % , and then , it was European Biophysics Journal 1 3 used to calculate spring constant using a protocol described elsewhere ( Schillers et al . 2017 ) . All pyramidal cantilevers reveal larger cantilever spring constants as compared to nominal values , while for the spherical probe , the cantilever spring constant was smaller . Such a relation is fully acciden - tal as spring constants depend strongly on production batch . Mechanical properties of polyacrylamide gels Knowing that cells are highly heterogeneous in their internal structure , in the first steps , polyacrylamide ( PA ) gels were applied , as they constitute samples of high homogeneity . To mimic the elasticity of bladder cancer cells ( Lekka et al . 1999 , 2019 ; Lin and Horkay 2008 ; Ramos et al . 2014 ) , two groups of gel samples , containing 5 % and 7 % of acrylamide monomers , were probed with all types of cantilevers . All samples were measured when immersed in deionized water after 24 h post - polymerization ( to minimize swelling effect ) . The Young’s modulus was calculated using Hertz – Sneddon mechanics and plotted as a function of indentation depth . Results show that for all pyramidal cantilevers , Young’s modulus decreases with increasing indentation depths , reaching a plateau for indentations above 300 nm ( Fig . 3a ) . We could identify two effects responsible for the shape of these relations , namely , contact point determination and the way of fitting the model to the data ( Fig . 1d ) . The former reason is mathematically obvious—a contact point posi - tion located within the region with higher deflections will deliver a larger Young’s modulus . The latter stems from the fact that the divergence of fitting data for the conical approximation of the AFM tip shape is larger for small indentations ( Fig . 1e , f ) . The relation between Young’s modulus and indentation obtained from data indented with a spherical probe was almost flat . To evaluate how large is the effect in the overall mechanical properties of poly - acrylamide samples , Young’s modulus was calculated for a whole and plateau regions of the indentation depth ( Fig . 3 ) . Results reveal that regardless of the tip geometry , for such highly elastic material like PA hydrogels , mutual relations between mechanical properties of the studied hydrogel samples were preserved , also regardless of the indentation depth region taken for the analysis . The moduli range for soft samples ( 5 % PA ) varied between 4 and 12 kPa while for stiffer samples ( 7 % PA ) —from 7 to 31 kPa . The low - est values were obtained from indenting experiments with spherical probes ( 4 . 43 ± 0 . 52 for 5 % PA and 7 . 41 ± 1 . 77 kPa ) in agreement with already published data ( Rico et al . 2005 ; Carl and Schillers 2008 ; Managuli and Roy 2017 ; Alcaraz et al . 2017 ; Sokolov and Dokukin 2017 ; Jorba et al . 2017 ; Giménez et al . 2017 ) . Although all moduli values originating from indentation experiments carried out using pyramidal cantilevers were larger , they were not uniform . As this stems from the shape of the indenting pyramid , thus , cantilevers were separated into non - symmetric and symmetric probes . Non - symmetric probes ( MLCT and MSNL ) deliver simi - lar modulus values of 8 – 9 kPa for 5 % PA and 17 – 19 kPa for 7 % PA . This could be an effect of optimization of the shape of these probes for indentation , as they are supposed to indent the sample perpendicularly . Moduli variations were much larger for symmetric probes , for which values of 6 – 12 kPa and 12 – 32 kPa were obtained for 5 % and 7 % PA , respectively . MSCT probes bring the corresponding Young’s moduli close to results obtained from non - symmetric canti - levers , i . e . , 8 . 56 ± 2 . 47 kPa but only for softer gel samples . Two other cantilever types ( PNP and OTR4 ) deliver values that deviate from that of MSCT , however , there is no pattern observed for these changes . Mechanical properties of soft PA gel samples ( 5 % PA ) were described by three different moduli values , i . e . , 8 . 56 ± 2 . 47 kPa ( MSCT ) , 6 . 29 ± 2 . 08 kPa ( OTR4 ) and 11 . 63 ± 4 . 05 kPa ( PNP ) . Stiffer gels ( 7 % PA ) were characterized by another set of values 12 . 64 ± 3 . 15 kPa ( MSCT ) , 12 . 51 ± 2 . 22 kPa ( OTR4 ) and 31 . 29 ± 7 . 18 kPa ( PNP ) . This is a bit surprising , as all symmetric cantile - vers have similar geometrical parameters : opening angle , height , and radius of curvature . Excluding the effect of the fit and contact point determination by considering only the plateau region did not unify the results . The moduli vari - ability between data obtained for MSCT , OTR4 , and PNP cantilevers remained . The only explanation considers the hydrogel’s response to a load rate , which changes with time Fig . 2 Representative SEM images of non - symmetric ( a ) , symmetric ( b ) , and spherical ( c ) AFM probes used in measure - ments of mechanical properties of hydrogels and cells European Biophysics Journal 1 3 during indentation and the applied load . This is dependent on the contact area with the probing tip . Altogether , these results demonstrate the shape of the AFM may play a role , even if mechanically homogenous samples are measured and support that it is important to use one type of cantilever dur - ing a set of measurements . Mechanical properties of bladder cancer cells To elaborate on the effect of the shape of the probing tip in cell - related measurements of mechanical properties , human bladder cancer cells were next studied . In comparison with PA hydrogels , cells are highly mechanically heterogeneous , as they are structurally heterogeneous . Analogously as for PA gels , measurements were conducted for three groups of cantilevers on non - malignant cell cancer of ureter ( HCV29 ) and bladder carcinoma ( HT1376 ) cells . The obtained results show that , similarly as for hydrogel samples , Young’s modu - lus varies as a function of the indentation depth ( Fig . 4a ) . Here , in addition to the approximation of the AFM tip shape and contact point determination , the high degree of mechanical heterogeneity of the superficial layers of the cell can contribute to the shape of the relation . Importantly , this does not affect the deformability difference between ref - erence ( non - malignant HCV29 ) and cancerous ( HT1376 ) cells . Independently of the cantilever type chosen for the study and indentation range taken for the analysis , always cancer cells are softer . Results recorded for data collected with the spherical probes were smaller ( 8 . 19 ± 0 . 46 kPa and 2 . 47 ± 0 . 25 kPa for HCV29 and HT1376 cells , respectively ) as compared to moduli calculated from data recorded with pyramidal cantilevers showing the corresponding values above 8 . 5 kPa and 3 . 5 kPa . Focusing on symmetric and non - symmetric cantilevers , there is no correlation with probe shape nor with cantilever spring constant . This prob - ably stems from the structure , heterogeneity , and viscoe - lastic nature of the cells . In our next step , we ask ourselves whether the choice of a specific geometry of the AFM probe and indentation range affects the difference between refer - ence and cancerous cells . In the case of considering a whole indentation range ( Fig . 4b ) , cancer cells were of 68 % , 48 % , 40 % , 46 % , 57 % and 67 % more deformable than HCV29 cells Fig . 3 a Relations between Young’s ( elastic ) modulus and the indentation depth , obtained for PA hydrogel samples measured with a set of AFM probes .

Note Y scale for PNP is twofold larger than for the other canti - levers ) European Biophysics Journal 1 3 when measured with MLCT , MSNL , PNP , MSCT , OTR4 and sQube types of cantilevers . In the case of considering indentations above 300 nm , the Young’s moduli of cancer cells were of 66 % , 50 % , 46 % , 52 % , 57 % and 72 % smaller than that for HCV29 cells when measured with MLCT , MSNL , PNP , MSCT , OTR4 and sQube types of cantilevers . These results show that by choosing a specific indentation range , it is possible to enhance the difference between refer - ence and cancerous cells from 2 to 6 % . This could have a significance when a smaller difference in cell deformability occurs . Our results allow us to conclude that for diagnostic purposes , all the types of AFM probes are suitable . This partially agrees with the observations by Kim et al . ( 2013 ) who studied mechanical properties of normal hepatocytes ( THLE - 2 ) and hepatocellular carcinoma cells ( HepG2 ) with a conical tip end and a bead probe . They state that the conical shape of the AFM tip delivers higher elastic modulus values and they also claim that conical probes are more suitable for comparative studies . However , Kulkarni et al . ( 2019 ) have recently shown that in certain biological conditions ( human pancreatic cancer cell line , Panc1 ) , one might observe the inverse relationship . It must be noted that indenting cells with sharp probes results in higher Young’s moduli than for cells indented with a spherical probe . This has already been reported by Carl and Schillers ( 2008 ) , who compared indentation data of living cells collected with sharp and various spherical probes . The results show that the size of the colloidal probe does not influence the elastic - ity results and that indenting the cells with sharp tips leads to higher Young’s moduli regardless of the cell type . In addi - tion , the standard deviation of modulus estimated for sharp probes is larger as compared to the spherical probe . This is related to the small radius of curvature of pyramidal probes enabling them to resolve a local ( nanometer scale ) spatial resolution . Consequently , such AFM measurements reveal cell - related variability resulting from the structural compo - nents of the cell .

Note Y scale for MLCT is twofold larger than for the other cantilevers ) European Biophysics Journal 1 3 is determined mainly by the cell membrane , the cytosol , and the cytoskeleton . The cytoskeleton is a mesh - like structure of actin filaments , microtubules , and intermediate filaments which causes anisotropic mechanical response due to the presence of stress fibers and attachments to the membrane . Elasticity maps recorded with a pyramidal AFM probe To analyze the effect of the choice of theoretical models , in our next step , we compare the outcome of the Young’s modulus determination for data recorded with a pyramidal probe , that shape was approximated either by a cone or a paraboloid . Acquired force curves were analyzed using two approximations of the shape of the AFM tip : cone and parab - oloid ( Fig . 5a , c ) . Young’s modulus calculated for parabo - loidal approximation of the tip shape is larger as compared to data obtained using a cone ( Fig . 5d ) . This is related to the mathematical function applied , i . e . , F = A · δ 1 . 5 instead of F = A · δ 2 . Instead of conical approximation , the data could also be approximated by a four - sided pyramid . Since the equations relating a load force and indentation follows the function F = A · δ 2 , the main difference between a cone and a pyramid is a constant factor . In such a case , the divergence between the raw data and the fitted curve will remain con - stant . A change will be observed in the fitted factor A . Analyzed data showed similarities in the calculated elas - ticity maps . In both cases , modulus changes depending on the force curve location . Single cells show a softer region around cell nuclei and are stiffer at the cell periphery . Higher Young’s modulus may also be a result of the presence of a stiff substrate used for cell culture . In such a case , the largest values are observed at the peripheral part of the cell , where their height is smaller than that in the nuclear regions ( Chiou et al . 2013 ) . The analysis focused on the force curves recorded only within a nuclear region shows a large variation in Young’s modulus in the case of parabo - loidal approximation of the AFM tip ( Fig . 5d ) . To evaluate whether such observation results from the effect of substrate , we applied finite thickness sample correction proposed by Dimitriadis et al . ( 2002 ) . Initial assumption that this stem from the substrate effect fails . Both histograms showing Young’s modulus distribution before and after finite thick - ness correction overlap ( Fig . 5d ) . Therefore , we assumed that the observed large modulus variability originated from the mismatch between recorded data and chosen mechanical model which was confirmed by looking at the R - squared ( a statistical measure describing how well a model was fit to the data ) . Its values change from 0 . 2 to 1 for the fits assum - ing paraboloidal approximation of the tip shape and from 0 . 7 to 1 for fitting with an assumed conical approximation of the tip shape .

In our study , the elastic modulus was determined from measurements with a wide range of AFM probes , and plotted as a function of the indentation depth . For highly elastic soft samples such as polyacrylamide gels , its value was not constant as expected ; oppositely , it reveals an exponential - like decrease showing a plateau for large indentations , which stems from the way the data are analysed but also it may include the load rate effect . Averaging over a whole sam - ple or only within the plateau range showed a significant difference in elastic properties of softer and stiffer hydro - gels . The magnitude of changes was dependent on the can - tilever used , more precisely on the shape of the probing tip . Spherical probes deliver the smallest Young’s modulus value ( according to already reported data ) , while pyrami - dal probes ( both non - symmetric and symmetric ) reveal a probe - dependent relation . Switching to results obtained from heterogeneous samples like cells , our analysis dem - onstrated that non - malignant HCV29 cells are stiffer than the cancerous HT1376 cells independently of the AFM cantilever type used . Analogously as for hydrogel samples , the smallest modulus was obtained for spherical probes , while for pyramidal probes , large moduli variability was observed . However , its character is different as compared to hydrogel samples and is linked with the structure of the cells or , as it was demonstrated for elasticity maps , with the fact that cells due to their viscoelastic nature fol - low neither with F = A · δ 1 . 5 nor with F = A · δ 2 functions . Altogether , these results show that the importance of the choice of cantilever type for studies of the mechanical properties of cells . In particular , the tip shape of the AFM probes affects the determination of Young’s moduli , even if mechanically homogenous samples are measured and support that it is important to use one type of cantilever during a set of measurements .
