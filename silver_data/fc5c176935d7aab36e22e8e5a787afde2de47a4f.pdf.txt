Abstract Fundamental to all living organisms and living soft matter are emergent processes in which the reorganization of individual constituents at the nanoscale drives group - level movements and shape changes at the macroscale over time . However , light - induced degradation of fluorophores , photobleaching , is a significant problem in extended live cell imaging in life science , and excellent prior arts of STED , MINSTED , or MINFLUX intentionally apply photobleaching optics for super - resolution , yet lack extended live - cell imaging capability as fluorophores reach an irreversible photobleaching limit . Here , we report an innovative way of opening a long - time investigation window of living matter by a nonbleaching p hase i ntensity n anoscop e : PINE . We accomplish phase - intensity separation to obtain phase differences between electric field components , such that nanoprobes within a diffraction limited region are distinguished from one another by an integrated phase - intensity multilayer thin film ( polyvinyl alcohol / liquid crystal ) . We obtain distributional patterns of precisely localized nanoprobes to overcome a physical limit to resolve sub - 10 nm cellular architectures , and achieve the first dynamic imaging of nanoscopic reorganization over 250 hours using nonbleaching PINE . Since PINE allows a long - time investigation window , we discover nanoscopic rearrangements synchronized with the emergence of group - level movements and shape changes at the macroscale according to a set of interaction rules . We believe that PINE and its application presented here provide a mechanistic understanding of emergent dynamics important in cellular and soft matter reorganization , self - organization , and pattern formation . 2 Keywords : plasmonic super - resolution , scattering super - resolution , bioplasmonics , nanoscopy Introduction How macroscale groups emerge over time from their individual constituents is fundamental to self - assembly , self - organization and pattern formation in material science 1 and biology 2 , 3 . The diverse range of emergent dynamics 4 – 6 spans at least three orders of magnitude in length scales and at least five orders of magnitude in time scales . Fluorescence super - resolution 7 – 11 – in which STED , MINSTED , MINFLUX intentionally apply photobleaching and STORM , dSTORM , PALM , dPALM cycle fluorescence states before photobleaching - have unlocked optical imaging across the spatial domain down to the sub - 10 nm length scale . However , light - induced degradation of fluorophores is permanent which ultimately sets an irreversible photobleaching limit and restricts observation time , making long - time super - resolution in live cells difficult to achieve . Thus , a long - time super - resolution method that can open a long - time investigation window down to the sub - 10 nm length scale is needed for visualizing emergent nanoscale - to - macroscale dynamics but has not been yet reported . Nanoprobes undergoing elastic scattering processes without photobleaching offers a nonbleaching approach to achieve long - time super - resolution . However , current methods 12 – 16 by moving analyzers / polarizers are subject to displacements and imprecise localization , making precise super - resolution difficult . Current demonstrations have resolved only two to few nanoprobes , whereas populations ( thousands ) are needed to form patterns of underlying cellular architectures . Additionally , all of the aforementioned methods have not achieved super - resolution down to the sub - 10 nm length scale . Herein , we present a nonbleaching p hase i ntensity n anoscop e , PINE to open a long - time investigation window of living matter down to the sub - 10 nm length scale . We designed an integrated phase - intensity multilayer thin film of polyvinyl alcohol and liquid crystalline polymers ( herein referred to as PI ) ( Figure 1a ) , enabling populations of randomly distributed nanoprobes 3 ( gold nanorods ) to exhibit phase differences between electric field components in a stochastic manner ( Figure 1b , 1c ) . Owing to the tunability of PI , we achieved phase - intensity separation of nanoprobes within a diffraction limited region by modulating phase differences between electric field components . As PI is displacement - free , precise localization of nanoprobe populations ( thousands ) form patterns of underlying cellular architectures enabling precise super - resolution down to the sub - 10 nm length scale . We quantified distributional parameters to overcome a physical limit to resolve sub - 10 nm cellular architectures . Using nonbleaching PINE , we obtained the first dynamic imaging of nanoscale reorganization over 250 hours , which outperforms state - of - the - art fluorescence super - resolution by more than two orders of magnitude . With a long - time investigation window by PINE ( Figure 1d ) , we identified emergent sy nchronized i n dividual - group c ontraction - expansion , SYNC , in which nanoscopic rearrangements coordinated with the emergence of group - level movements and shape changes at the macroscale during the cell division process according to a set of interaction rules . We are able to achieve long - time sub - 10 nm nanoscopy and follow the emergence of large scale collectives involving hundreds of cellular architectures ( > 900 ) in cells , all of which cannot be obtained using existing fluorescence 7 – 11 or nonbleaching 12 – 16 methods . Results Principle of PI device design We fabricated PI ( Figure 2a ) for precise control of phase differences between electric field components to accomplish phase - intensity separation of nanoprobes within a diffraction limited region ( Figure 2b ) . The compact multilayer design ( ~ 600 µm thickness ) was integrated into the infinity space between the objective and tube lens ( Figure 1c ) , enabling high transmission for nanoscopy . Scattering 17 – 23 without photobleaching was used . Input light to PI was the scattered light from a population of nanoprobes ( gold nanorods ) . Scattered light was reshaped , phase modulated , and converted from phase to intensity by PI . Phase differences between electric field 4 components enable nanoprobes within a diffraction limited region to be distinguished from one another by phase - intensity separation . Because the optical axis is stationary , PI is displacement - free for precise nanoscopy .

The Jones matrices represent a polyvinyl alcohol layer designed as a fixed retarding element for reshaping , 4 - cyano - 4 ′ - pentylbiphenyl and 4 - ( 3 - acryloyoxypropyloxy ) benzoic acid 2 - methyl - 1 , 4 - phenylene ester layer designed as a variable retarding element for phase modulation , and polyvinyl alcohol - iodine layer designed as a fixed linear polarizing element for phase - to - intensity conversion . The resulting variation of intensity corresponded to subsets of nanoprobes where 𝐼 ( 𝛾 ) = cos (cid:2870) (cid:4672) (cid:3082) (cid:2870) (cid:4673) 𝐸 (cid:3051)(cid:2870) + sin (cid:2870) (cid:4672) (cid:3082) (cid:2870) (cid:4673) 𝐸 (cid:3052)(cid:2870) + 2cos (cid:4672) (cid:3082) (cid:2870) (cid:4673) 𝐸 (cid:3051) sin (cid:4672) (cid:3082) (cid:2870) (cid:4673) 𝐸 (cid:3052) sin ( 𝛿 ) ( 2 ) PI was fabricated by a deposition process , where precursor of 4 - ( 3 - acryloyoxypropyloxy ) benzoic acid 2 - methyl - 1 , 4 - phenylene ester , 1 - hydroxycyclohexyl phenyl ketone , and 4 - cyano - 4 ′ - pentylbiphenyl was deposited and cured between two indium tin oxide - polyethylene terephthalate substrates on top of polyvinyl alcohol - iodine layer . Polyvinyl alcohol was layered on top of the aforementioned layers . We characterized the material alignment uniformity and millisecond response time . During phase - intensity modulation , the center coordinates were expressed as 𝑥 (cid:3082) = 𝑥 (cid:2868) , 𝑦 (cid:3082) = 𝑦 (cid:2868) ( 3 ) 5 where x 0 and y 0 are the center coordinates prior to modulation . Here , the optical axis was stationary such that ( x  , y  ) is equal to ( x 0 , y 0 ) , enabling zero displacement for precise nanoscopy . This allows for precise localization and eliminates potential error propagation in scaling up 24 . In scaling up , populations ( thousands ) of precisely localized nanoprobes forms patterns of underlying architectures of arbitrary shape . Conventional microscopy blurs the distribution of nanoprobes convolved with the point spread function ( PSF ) of the imaging system . To obtain sub - 10 nm information , nanoprobes within a diffraction limited region were isolated by phase - intensity separation with zero displacement for precise nanoscopy such that the distribution of precisely localized nanoprobes forms pattern of underlying architectures . From the distribution of precisely localized nanoprobes , surface or curvilinear features f ( p ) were defined . By defining a new parameter  , sub - 10 nm information was obtained from the distribution  ( p ) . Sub - 10 nm PINE To validate the phase - intensity separation concept , we investigated nanoprobes ( gold nanorods ) fabricated by electron beam lithography in order to systematically vary geometrical parameters . For this validation study , we chose electron beam lithography over chemical synthesis because of precise fabrication control of geometrical parameters . As a model , we fabricated plasmonic gold nanorods to determine whether phase differences between electric field components could be used to segregate nanorods in a diffraction limited region . Due to their high aspect ratio geometries significantly smaller than the wavelength , conduction electrons collectively oscillate in phase , resulting in strong scattering cross - sections 25 , 26 , 35 – 38 , 27 – 34 . As an initial test , the scattered light from a pair of nanorods was reshaped by PI . When PI modulated  from 0 to 2  rad , the phase difference between E x and E y was varied from -  rad and the positions of each nanorod emerged . PINE precisely determined the spatial positions of each gold nanorod ( Figure 2b and 2c ) . Localization was firstly optimized based on geometrical parameter , aspect ratio , via 6 simulation , whereby we then selected aspect ratio 2 . 9 to be fabricated by electron beam lithography . Due to the delicate nature of electron beam fabricated samples , a long working distance low NA objective and dry condenser with a diffraction limit of 450 nm were used . In Figure 2d , we benchmarked geometrical parameter l imaged by PINE against l measured by scanning electron microscopy . We fixed  and then varied l between 100 nm to 400 nm . We validated localization accuracy in agreement with scanning electron microscopy measurements with an R 2 of 0 . 97 ( Figure 2d ) . We then turned to geometrical parameter  . In Figure 2e , we varied  between 2° to 100° at a fixed known subdiffraction l of 300 nm which was below the diffraction limit of 450 nm . Owing to the displacement - free multilayer , nearly identical nanorods as 𝛼 → 0 could be precisely localized ( red curve Figure 2e ) . The minimum  that two proximal nanoprobes will require at an effective subdiffraction l is 2° . To answer the question of the minimum  that two nanoprobes at the minimum l will require , we then varied both  and l . The minimum  that two nanoprobes at the minimum l of 80 nm is 45° . Smaller  are resolvable at larger subdiffraction l below the diffraction limit . We verified multiple nanoprobes within a diffraction limited region were phase - intensity separated by PI ( Figure 2f ) . We estimate approximately twenty nanorods can be resolved in a diffraction limited spot . Randomly distributed nanoprobes introduce a stochastic variation within a population ( Figure 3a ) . We reasoned their phase differences between electric field components should be also stochastically distributed . We utilized this stochasticity for the purpose of enhancing resolution . In order to form patterns of underlying cellular architectures , structurally stabilized nanoprobes in which scaling up to distributions of nanoprobes are required . Traditionally , gold nanorods 39 , 40 are synthesized with a strong cationic charge from hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide capping in which achieving 100 % CTA + free necessary for structural stability has been 7 historically difficult due to the strong cationic charge 41 . Here , we chemically synthesized with bromide - free surfactants to yield 100 % CTA + free monodisperse gold nanorods with size variability of ~ 5 % . 42 , 43 We achieved structurally stabilized distributions of nanoprobes for nanoscopic imaging ( Figure 3 ) . In scaling up , populations of precisely localized nanoprobes formed patterns of the underlying cellular architectures . In cells , actin plays key roles both in bundled and single filament forms . Actin was labeled with CTA + free nanorods conjugated with antibodies targeting actin . Scanning electron microscopy images verified nanoprobes were randomly distributed along actin bundles . PI reshaped scattered light from the randomly distributed population of nanoprobes . PI then modulated  from 0 to 2  rad ( Figure 3b ) which varied the phase difference between E x and E y from -  rad . After phase - to - intensity conversion , the resulting variation of intensity corresponded to subsets of precisely localized nanoprobes . To form patterns , we were able to scalably resolve nanoprobe populations from few to 7 , 769 nanoprobes ( up to ~ 10 2 / µm 2 ) . Scaling up allowed for distributions of precisely localized nanoprobes to form patterns of the underlying actin bundles in agreement with scanning electron microscopy . Underlying architectures were identified for nanoprobe labeling densities of ~ 10 2 / µm 2 based on distribution of distances from every nanoprobe to its first neighbor following a distribution function 44 , enabling continuous features to be defined from the discrete nanoprobe distributions in agreement with scanning electron microscopy . In contrast to bundles we observed earlier , actin is often in single filament form in cells 45 . In SH - SY5Y cells , nanoprobes within a diffraction limited region were isolated by phase - intensity separation by modulating  from 0 to 2  rad using PI . Precisely localized nanoprobes formed patterns of the underlying single filaments . While the minimum l is 80 nm , sub - 10 nm information can be obtained . Surface or curvilinear features f ( p ) were defined . Parameter  was obtained from the pattern of precisely localized nanoprobe populations and f ( p ) . From the distribution  ( p ) , PINE revealed actin width to be 8 . 0 nm ( Figure 3c ) consistent with width of actin filaments in cells 46 . 8 Notably , sub - 10 nm features revealed single filament architectures ( Figure 3c iii ) and branched architectures ( Figure 3c iv ) which were indistinguishable from each other in the absence of sub - 10 nm information . Both controls - absence of both nanoprobes and antibody ; presence of nanoprobes without antibody - were negative . To our knowledge , this is the first sub - 10 nm demonstration by a nonbleaching nanoscopy method owing to the displacement - free mechanism of PI for precise nanoscopy . Long - time PINE ( Model : Emergent dynamics SYNC ) A longstanding question is how macroscale groups emerge from their individual constituents . Commonalities between diverse systems suggest general rules 47 – 50 guiding the collective reorganization of individuals into groups . This has prompted models of emergent phenomena ranging from microscale forces 51 – 53 and cellular forces at the macroscale 54 , 55 to microscale chemical reactions 56 , 57 and macroscale reactions among networks 58 , underscoring a need for experiments and theories bridging across diverse length scales and time scales . Using PINE , the ability to bridge across diverse length scales and time scales provides a unique opportunity to shed light on the collective reorganization of individuals and groups ( Figure 1b iii ) . When large scale collectives involve hundreds of individual constituents , increasing experimental evidence 5 , 59 suggests that collective behavior may arise from local interactions versus global instructions . From a set of local interaction rules , we describe sy nchronized i n dividual - group c ontraction - expansion , SYNC , in which individual constituents coordinate with group level movements and shape changes at the macroscale ( Figure 4a ) . A group of N individuals will expand or contract based on connectivity between neighboring individuals . Connectivity c is defined as the ability of individuals to connect with one or more others . Rule 1 : An individual will occupy more short - range space to increase connectivity with neighbors . 𝑠 (cid:3036) = ∑ (cid:3043) (cid:3284) ( (cid:3047) ) (cid:2879)(cid:3043) (cid:3286) ( (cid:3047) ) | (cid:3043) (cid:3284) ( (cid:3047) ) (cid:2879)(cid:3043) (cid:3286) ( (cid:3047) ) | (cid:3038)(cid:2999)(cid:3036) ( 4 ) 9 where s i is the direction of movement of individual i within a short - range space  , p i is the position vector of an individual i , and p k is the position vector of a neighbor k within the short - range space  . This simulates the movement direction of an individual to alter connectivity with short - range neighbors . Rule 2 : Long - range space between individuals will decrease to increase connectivity with neighbors . 𝑙 (cid:3036) = − ∑ (cid:3043) (cid:3284) ( (cid:3047) ) (cid:2879)(cid:3043) (cid:3285) ( (cid:3047) ) (cid:3627)(cid:3043) (cid:3284) ( (cid:3047) ) (cid:2879)(cid:3043) (cid:3285) ( (cid:3047) ) (cid:3627) (cid:3037)(cid:2999)(cid:3036) ( 5 ) where l i is the direction of movement of individual i within a long - range space  , p i is the position vector of an individual i , and p j is the position vector of a neighbor j within a long - range space  . This represents the movement direction of an individual to alter connectivity with long - range neighbors . Rule 3 : Group contracts with increased connectivity . Group expands with decreased connectivity . 𝑀 (cid:3036) ( 𝑡 + Δ𝑡 ) = − ∑ (cid:3030) [ (cid:3043) (cid:3284) ( (cid:3047) ) (cid:2879)(cid:3043) (cid:3285) ( (cid:3047) ) ] (cid:2879)(cid:3046) (cid:3284) (cid:3627)(cid:3030) [ (cid:3043) (cid:3284) ( (cid:3047) ) (cid:2879)(cid:3043) (cid:3285) ( (cid:3047) ) ] (cid:2879)(cid:3046) (cid:3284) (cid:3627) (cid:3036)(cid:2999)(cid:3037) ( 6 ) where M i is the direction of movement of individual i over time t influenced by connectivity c . This manifests in expansion or contraction of the group on the basis of connectivity between neighboring individuals . Thus , c was increased for expansion and c was decreased for contraction . SYNC was quantified by resultant connection defined as ( 1 − 𝒞 ) . We found there was a threshold group size for collective behavior at the group level . At the threshold group size , expansion - contraction behavior commenced ( Figure 4e i ) , meaning sufficient interactions between individuals and neighboring individuals were necessary . Thereafter , as the group size became larger , the expansion - contraction behavior increased . Threshold group size may impact expansile and contractile forces of a connected actin network ( group ) influenced by filament length and density 54 . Long - time PINE ( Experiment : Emergent dynamics SYNC ) 10 We applied the model together with PINE to investigate the emergent process of cell division 60 . In order to investigate nanoscopic dynamics , we benchmarked the temporal capabilities of PINE against fluorescence super - resolution ( Figure 4b ) . Benchmarking nanoprobe - labeled actin bundles resolved by PINE with fluorophore - labeled actin bundles resolved by fluorescence super - resolution , subdiffraction resolution was preserved under continuous analysis using PINE , whereas with fluorescence super - resolution , subdiffraction capabilities were lost over time ( < 200 s ) with continuous exposure to illumination . To validate long - time observation capabilities , we followed the temporal evolution of cellular architectures ( actin ) ( Figure 4c ) and observed nanoscale rearrangements below the diffraction limit in agreement with theoretical modeling . PINE can uniquely reveal individual constituents at the sub - 10 nm scale , their meso - and macroscale group level coordination , simultaneously with the temporal emergence of collective processes over time ( Figure 1b iii ) . If macroscale movements and shape changes are linked to the individual constituents , we reasoned that individuals and groups should exhibit coordinated behavior . To test this hypothesis , we followed individual , meso - and macro - scale reorganization as a parental cell grew and separated into daughter cells ( Figure 4d ) . To identify progression through cell division , we assessed variations in nuclear features 61 over time ( Figure 4d i ) . Using PINE , we observed a macroscale expansion - contraction behavior consistent with literature 62 , where the cell area of parental cells initially expanded corresponding to G 1 , S and G 2 phases ( corresponding to decreased connectivity in the model ) ; thereafter , cell area contracted corresponding to M phase ( corresponding to increased connectivity in the model ) , and then expanded as parental cells divided into daughter cells ( corresponding to decreased connectivity in the model ) . Shape changes are known to be related to the cytoskeleton 63 ; however , how individual constituents contribute to macroscale reorganization remain incompletely understood . Using PINE , we observed the sub - 10 nm width of individual filaments remained consistent over time , indicating actin maintained as individual filaments ( Figure 4d iii ) . By following hundreds of individual 11 constituents ( 904 filaments ) , we discovered individual filaments also underwent expansion - contraction behavior at the individual level synchronized with macroscale shape changes : i . length of individual filaments initially contracted during G 1 , S and G 2 phases ( corresponding to decreased connectivity in the model ) . ii . next , length of individual filaments expanded during the M phase ( corresponding to increased connectivity in the model ) . iii . finally , the length of individual filaments contracted as parental cells divided into daughter cells ( corresponding to decreased connectivity in the model ) . At the mesoscale , the density of individual filaments also exhibited expansion - contraction behavior observed by PINE coordinated with macroscale shape changes . During G 1 , S and G 2 phases , the density of individual filaments decreased ( corresponding to decreased connectivity in the model ) . In the M phase , the density of individual filaments increased ( corresponding to increased connectivity in the model ) . Finally , the density of individual filaments decreased as parental cells divided into daughter cells ( corresponding to decreased connectivity in the model ) . No expansion - contraction behavior was observed in the undivided control ( Figure 4e ii ) . Taken together , PINE revealed emergent dynamics in which individuals and groups exhibited synchronized reorganization at the individual , meso - and macro - scale levels ( Figure 4e ii ) . Discussion In discussion , the method introduced here can be used to overcome time limitations of fluorescence super - resolution for long - time nanoscopy . Using nonbleaching PINE , we demonstrated dynamic nanoscopy of living matter over 250 hours , more than two orders of magnitude outperforming state - of - the - art fluorescence super - resolution . We resolved sub - 10 nm cellular architectures and followed the emergence of their coordinated reorganization during the cell division process . We introduced a model based on local interactions of individuals to describe how individual constituents can synchronize with group level movements and shape changes at the macroscale . Presented here , we applied the model to the cell division process . This simple 12 model provides a direct link between individual constituents and overall shape changes at the macroscale . The mechanism of coordination we proposed here in the model showed local interactions between neighboring individual constituents are sufficient to emerge into group level reorganization ( Figure 4e ) . Analogous to disruption of animal herds under attack 64 , how individual - group coordinated reorganization may be disrupted in disease are possibilities to be explored in the future . This is important to our understanding of dynamical emergent processes involved in cellular reorganization , self - organization and pattern formation . This model can be applied to other soft matter , such as shape changing materials 65 . In this work , we achieved PINE - resolved images with nanoprobe densities of ~ 10 2 / µm 2 , whereas higher nanoprobe densities are typically utilized in traditional fluorescence super - resolution . Since the distribution of distances from every nanoprobe to its first neighbor follows a distribution function 44 , underlying protein architectures can be identified for nanoprobe labeling densities of ~ 10 2 / µm 2 , albeit lower than nanoprobe densities typically used in traditional fluorescence super - resolution . This offers an advantage for live imaging to minimize excessive nanoprobe labeling which may affect observed dynamics . PINE has the potential for in vivo nanoscopy . A current limitation is the nanoprobe size for sufficient scattering . In the future , in vivo sub - 10 nm nanoprobes displaying geometric singularities for extremely high field generation can be designed to be modulated by phase - intensity to overcome this limitation with interferometry . PINE has the potential for four - dimensional ( 4 - D ) nanoscopy ( t , x , y , z ) . A current limitation is the sample depth and background scattering . In the future , volume ( sample depth ) can be achieved by employing PINE with light - sheets ( i . e . , optical z sectioning ) and background subtraction algorithms . This could lead to exciting studies of long timescale processes , such as emergent processes , evolutionary processes , ageing and age - related phenomena . New control methods , such as subdiffraction optical tweezers , used in conjunction with PINE , would create exciting possibilities for spatiotemporal control of in vivo 13 processes . In conclusion , we believe PINE will open new nanoscopic opportunities for investigations demanding long - time observation windows . 14 Figure 1 .
