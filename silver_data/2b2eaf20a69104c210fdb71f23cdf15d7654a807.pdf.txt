This study sought to contribute to serosurveillance work within Northern Ireland to track SARS - CoV - 2 progression and guide health strategy . Methods : Sera / plasma samples from clinical biochemistry laboratories were analysed for anti - SARS - CoV - 2 immunoglobulins ( Ig ) . Samples were assessed using an Elecsys anti - SARS - CoV - 2 or anti - SARS - CoV - 2 S ECLIA ( Roche ) on an automated Cobas - e - analyser . Samples were also assessed via ELISA ( Euroimmun ) . A subset of samples assessed via Roche Elecsys anti - SARS - CoV - 2 IgG assay were subsequently analysed in an ACE2 pseudoneutralisation assay using a V - PLEX SARS - CoV - 2 Panel 7 for IgG and ACE2 by MesoScale Diagnostics Inc . Results : Across three testing rounds ( June - July 2020 , November - December 2020 and June - July 2021 ( rounds 1 - 3 respectively ) ) , 4844 residual sera / plasma specimens were assayed for SARS - CoV - 2 Ig . Seropositivity rates increased across the study , peaking at 11 . 6 % during round 3 . Varying trends in SARS - CoV - 2 seropositivity were noted based on demographic factors . For instance , highest rates of seropositivity shifted from older to younger demographics across the study period . In round 3 , alpha ( B . 1 . 1 . 7 ) variant neutralising antibodies were most frequently detected across age groups , with median concentration of anti - spike protein antibodies elevated in 50 - 69 year olds and anti - S1 RBD antibodies elevated in over 70s , relative to other age groups . .

Efforts to control SARS - CoV - 2 transmission led the UK government to impose nationwide lockdowns , strict social distancing measures and widescale testing programmes to rapidly identify and isolate infected individuals . Despite these restrictions , continued spread of SARS - CoV - 2 remained a challenge , highlighting the need for ongoing surveillance to track disease epidemiology and guide public health policy moving forwards . Numerous options exist for testing and monitoring of SARS - CoV - 2 , including the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) that has formed the gold standard diagnostic approach to date . 1 - 3 This highly sensitive technique facilitates the molecular detection of viral RNA that is typically collected via nasopharyngeal swabs , although it is prohibited by the need for significant laboratory infrastructure and longer turnaround times . Moreover , RT - PCR is of limited use beyond the acute phase of SARS - CoV - 2 infection so prevalence rates may be grossly underestimated . Alternatively , serological assays enable the detection of SARS - CoV - 2 - reactive antibodies in sera / plasma , which are released into the circulation in the weeks following infection and often persist for many months thereafter . 4 - 6 These assays therefore provide an indication of prior exposure to SARS - CoV - 2 and are particularly insightful for gathering information on asymptomatic infection in those who may not have satisfied eligibility criteria for PCR screening , providing a more refined estimate of SARS - CoV - 2 prevalence . Many serological studies have been conducted worldwide 7 - 12 and have informed planning in several contexts ( e . g . vaccination scheduling in response to waning .

For Northern Ireland in particular , estimates of SARS - CoV - 2 seroprevalence have been largely derived from the ongoing Coronavirus ( COVID - 19 ) Infection Survey , where sera are sampled from randomly selected households across each of the jurisdictions within the UK . Here , we employed an alternative sampling source to derive a further independent estimate of the proportion of Northern Irish residents who contracted SARS - CoV - 2 in the period to July 2021 . The Northern Ireland health system is divided into five Health and Social Care Trusts and therefore to efficiently sample a broad spectrum of the population , residual sera / plasma specimens were procured from clinical biochemistry laboratories within each of the five Trusts and analysed for the presence of anti - SARS - CoV - 2 immunoglobulins ( Ig ) using commercial immunoassay kits in both hospital and academic settings . We report temporal and demographic trends in Ig response , providing crucial insight into how seropositivity has evolved over time and how it has been influenced by characteristics including age , gender and place of residence . Methods Sample collection Ethical approval for this study was obtained from the Northern Ireland Biobank . The Northern Ireland Biobank has ethical approval from The Office of Research Ethics Committees Northern Ireland ( ORECNI REF 21 / NI / 0019 ) and can confer ethical approval for projects which have received material from the bank . 13 Residual blood sera / plasma specimens ( originally collected .

Samples were acquired during three timeframes : June - July 2020 , November - December 2020 and June - July 2021 . Anti - SARS - CoV - 2 IgG electrochemiluminescence immunoassay ( ECLIA ) Sera / plasma samples were assayed using the Elecsys anti - SARS - CoV - 2 or anti - SARS - CoV - 2 S ECLIA ( Roche ) on an automated Cobas e analyser in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions . Anti - SARS - CoV - 2 IgG enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) Sera / plasma samples were assayed using the anti - SARS - CoV - 2 IgG ELISA ( Euroimmun ) in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions . Semiquantitative assessment of anti - SARS - CoV - 2 IgG was achieved by calculating the ratio of the extinction of the control or donor sample over the extinction of the calibrator . Ratios were interpreted as follows : < 0 . 8 = negative , ≥ 0 . 8 to < 1 . 1 = borderline and ≥ 1 . 1 = positive . ACE2 pseudoneutralisation IgG assay A subset of n = 278 plasma samples collected in the June - July 2021 cohort with Roche Elecsys anti - SARS - CoV - 2 IgG assay data ( n = 219 S - antibody reactive samples ; n = 59 S - antibody negative samples as controls ) were subsequently analysed by an ACE2 pseudoneutralisation assay . Receptor Binding Domain ( RBD ) - specific IgG and their neutralising capacity against SARS - CoV - 2 wild type and variants B . 1 . 1 . 7 ( Alpha ) , B . 1 . 351 ( Beta ) and P . 1 ( Gamma ) were measured using .

( MSD , USA ) according to the manufacturer ' s instructions and expressed as neutralising antibody concentration in µ g / ml . Briefly , the assay uses spot multiplexing of 9 viral antigens within each plate well . For the ACE2 neutralisation assay , the ability of antibodies to block the binding of ACE2 to its cognate ligands was measured . Antibodies in plasma samples ( diluted 1 : 10 ) that block the RBD antigen interaction with ACE2 on the spots were analysed , and a recombinant human ACE2 conjugated with MSD SULFO - TAG™ was used for detection . All plates were analysed on a MESO QuickPlex SQ 120 electrochemiluminescence reader to measure the light emitted from the SULFO - TAG™ . Results for the MSD assays are reported in µ g / ml derived from back fitting the measured signals for samples to a calibration curve generated for each plate . For the 7 - point calibration curve , a 4 - fold serial dilution was used with two replicates at each calibrator level and an additional zero calibrator blank . By correcting for dilution , the final antibody concentrations in undiluted samples were obtained . Detailed information on antigens , control samples and ACE2 calibrator reagent , including concentrations in µ g / ml , are presented in the kit inserts provided by MSD ( ACE2 cat no . K15440U ) . Cut off values supplied by the manufacturer of 0 . 762 µ g / ml and 0 . 533 µ g / ml were used to determine participant reactivity to SARS - CoV - 2 S1 RBD and SARS - CoV - 2 spike , respectively . Data analysis Crude and standardised apparent proportions with anti - SARS - CoV - 2 Ig were determined along with 95 % confidence intervals . Additionally , crude and standardised true proportions were determined adopting the Bayesian method used by Public Health England 14 , which accounted for the sensitivity of 71 / 100 ( 71 % ) and specificity of 777 / 786 ( 98 . 9 % ) of the test . Crude true proportion was also determined using the Rogan - Gladen method 15 to account for test .

GraphPad Prism software ( version 9 . 1 . 1 ) was used to plot data . Variables including age , gender , Health and Social Care Trust and postcode area were analysed using descriptive statistics . Frequencies and percentages were calculated for categorical variables and median and inter - quartile range for continuous variables . The chi - squared test of independence was used to test whether the proportion of individuals with neutralising antibodies for spike and anti - RBD was similar across four age groups . Neutralising antibody concentrations in each age group , for wild type , alpha , beta , and gamma variants of spike and anti - RBD , were further compared using Kruskal - Wallis test ( comparison between > 2 groups ) and Wilcoxon test ( pairwise - comparison between groups ) with the Benjamini and Hochberg multiple comparisons test adjustment . The Shapiro - Wilk test was used to determine if the neutralising antibody concentration data significantly deviated from a normal distribution . The ‘outcode’ data , a partial UK postcode constituting the postcode area and the postcode district , available with each participant sample , was used to generate geographic maps of % reactivity and participant numbers . Outcode boundary shapes , the total number of individuals that tested positive for anti - SARS - CoV - 2 IgG , and the total number of tests performed were used to calculate outcode - level % reactivity rates . Statistical analyses were performed using the R statistical software ( version 3 . 6 . 3 ) in RStudio ( version 1 . 2 . 5033 ) . .

Initial analyses were conducted using the Euroimmun anti - SARS - CoV - 2 ELISA with the spike S1 domain as target antigen , whereas subsequent analyses employed the Roche Elecsys assay to examine sample reactivity towards the nucleocapsid protein . This ensured that seroprevalence estimates were confined to natural infection only and not confounded by vaccinated individuals with induced antibody responses against the spike protein . Our choice to sample at various timepoints enabled temporal assessment of antibody responses at different phases of the pandemic . Round 1 studies were performed following the first national lockdown that was enforced in March 2020 ( post - lockdown 1 ) , whereas rounds 2 and 3 coincided with the pre - and post - lockdown phases of the second national lockdown imposed in December 2020 ( pre - and post - lockdown 2 , respectively ) . Of the 1108 samples assayed during round 1 , a total of 43 showed detectable levels of anti - SARS - CoV - 2 Ig equating to a seropositivity rate of 3 . 9 % ( 95 % CI 2 . 9 % - 5 . 4 % ) ( Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Table 2 ) . This increased only marginally during round 2 , where 5 . 2 % ( 95 % CI 4 . 0 % - 6 . 5 % ) of samples were seropositive for anti - SARS - CoV - 2 Ig ( 64 of 1242 ) . However , a more pronounced increase was observed during round 3 , where 11 . 6 % ( 95 % CI 10 . 4 % - 13 . 0 % ) of samples were seropositive for anti - SARS - CoV - 2 Ig ( 290 of 2494 ) . .

Collective sera for the entire study were sampled from a wide age range of 0 – 100 years , although the majority were from persons aged 50 + years with comparatively fewer from those < 50 years during each testing round ( Supplementary Table 3 ) . Clear age - related differences in antibody responses were observed at various stages of the pandemic . For example , during round 1 of testing ( post - lockdown 1 ) , seropositivity rates were marginally lower in those aged 0 – 29 years at 2 . 7 % compared to other age brackets ( Figure 1 ) . However , subsequent testing rounds revealed a shift in this trend as seropositivity rates became higher in the younger age brackets , peaking at 16 . 1 % in 0 – 29 year olds during round 3 of testing ( post - lockdown 2 ) ( Figure 1 ) . The anti - IgG and anti - RBD IgG neutralising concentrations in round 3 sera / plasma showed age dependent increases for spike proteins ( Figure 2 ) . The majority of participants determined to be S - antibody reactive ( by anti - SARS - CoV - 2 IgG assay ) had neutralising antibodies above the reactive cut - off for wild type ( WT ) spike ( 70 . 1 % ) and S1 RBD ( 73 . 4 % ) ( Supplementary Table 4 ) . Amongst the variants tested , higher proportions of the S - antibody reactive population showed neutralising antibody reactivity toward the alpha versions of S1 RBD ( 72 . 7 % ) and spike ( 64 . 4 % ) proteins . In addition , significant differences in the proportion of S - antibody reactive individuals with neutralising antibodies for WT ( p < 0 . 001 ) , and alpha ( p < 0 . 001 ) , beta ( p = 0 . 001 ) and gamma ( p < 0 . 001 ) variants of spike protein were found between age groups . We observed no significant age differences in the proportion of subjects with neutralising antibodies targeting WT ( p = 0 . 22 ) , and alpha ( p = 0 . 26 ) , beta ( p = 0 . 06 ) , and gamma ( p = 0 . 08 ) variants of S1 RBD . However , significant differences in neutralising antibody concentrations .

The pairwise - comparison revealed statistically significant differences between : i ) 0 - 29 and 50 - 69 age groups ( p = 0 . 033 ) , 0 - 29 and 70 + age groups ( p = 0 . 033 ) , 30 - 49 and 50 - 69 age groups ( p = 0 . 004 ) , and 30 - 49 and 70 + age groups ( p = 0 . 004 ) for the wild type of spike protein ; ii ) 0 - 29 and 50 - 69 age groups ( p = 0 . 047 ) , 0 - 29 and 70 + age groups ( p = 0 . 022 ) , and 30 - 49 and 70 + age groups ( p = 0 . 045 ) for the alpha variant of spike protein ; iii ) 0 - 29 and 70 + age groups ( p = 0 . 041 ) and 30 - 49 and 70 + age groups ( p = 0 . 041 ) for the wild type of S1 RBD ; and iv ) 30 - 49 and 70 + age groups ( p = 0 . 043 ) for the alpha variant of S1 RBD . Variations in antibody response were also observed between genders as the pandemic progressed , with males showing higher seropositivity rates than females during rounds 1 ( 4 . 2 % vs . 3 . 4 % ) and 2 ( 5 . 4 % vs . 5 . 0 % ) of testing , whereas this trend was reversed in round 3 ( 9 . 9 % vs . 12 . 9 % ) ( Figure 3 ) . Of note , however , a much larger number of females were sampled versus males during all three testing rounds ( Supplementary Table 3 ) . In terms of Health and Social Care Trust , a comparable number of samples were assayed from each of the Belfast , Northern , South Eastern , Southern and Western Trusts during all three testing rounds ( Supplementary Table 3 ) . All Trusts recorded the highest seropositivity rates during round 3 of testing ( Figure 4A ) . For the Belfast , Northern and Western Trusts , seropositivity increased with each sequential testing round . However , the Southern and South Eastern Trusts showed an initial decline in seropositivity during round 2 versus round 1 of testing , which was reversed during round 3 . .

For round 1 of testing , overall seropositivity rates were highest in BT65 ( Legahory , Moyraverty , Tullygally , Drumgor , Monbrief ) , BT62 ( Craigavon , Portadown , Tandragee , Clare , Scotch Street ) , and BT17 ( West Belfast , North Lisburn ) postcode areas at 100 . 0 % , 22 . 2 % and 15 . 4 % respectively . However , the number of participants differ significantly between postcodes , with the number of samples assayed from BT65 , BT62 , and BT17 at 1 , 27 , and 13 respectively . During round 2 , the highest seropositivity rate of 33 . 3 % was recorded for BT10 ( South Belfast ) and BT70 ( Dungannon , Ballygawley , Cappagh , Castlecaulfield , Donaghmore , Galbally , Garvaghy , Pomeroy , Rock , Seskilgreen ) postcodes . Although the BT65 postal area showed an initial decline in seropositivity during round 2 versus round 1 of testing , round 3 revealed a shift in this trend , with BT65 having again one of the highest seropositivity rates ( 55 . 6 % ) in Northern Ireland . During round 3 , the BT94 postcode area ( Irvinestown , Ballinamallard , Brookeborough , Tempo , Maguiresbridge , Lisbellaw ) reported the highest proportion of individuals that tested positive for anti - SARS - CoV - 2 IgG . For the following postcodes , seropositivity increased with each sequential testing round : BT4 ( East Belfast ) , BT7 ( South Belfast ) , BT11 ( West Belfast ) , BT24 ( Ballynahinch , Drumaness , Saintfield ) , BT28 ( Lisburn , Ballinderry Lower , Ballinderry Upper , Stoneyford ) , BT30 ( Downpatrick , Ardglass , Ballyhornan , Ballykinler , Castleward , Clough , Crossgar , Kilclief , Killard , Killough , Killyleagh , Listooder , Loughinisland , Seaforde , Strangford , Toye ) , BT34 ( Newry , Annalong , Ballymartin , Cabra , Hilltown , Kilcoo , Kilkeel , Mayobridge , Rathfriland , Rostrevor , Warrenpoint ) , BT37 ( Newtownabbey ) , BT47 ( Derry , Waterside , Claudy , Feeny , Dungiven , Eglinton , Park , New Buildings ) , BT49 ( Limavady , Ballykelly ) , BT66 ( Derryadd , Derrytrasna , Dollingstown , Donaghcloney , Lurgan , Waringstown ) , and BT82 ( Strabane , .

In response , our study was initiated to gather information on the seroprevalence of anti - SARS - CoV - 2 Ig in Northern Ireland , which would provide an indication of those with previous exposure to the virus . Residual sera from clinical biochemistry laboratories were assayed at various timepoints throughout 2020 - 2021 using a combination of anti - SARS - CoV - 2 immunoassays against both the spike and nucleocapsid antigens . Our analysis showed that seroprevalence rates increased as the pandemic progressed and were also strongly influenced by demographics including age , gender and place of residence . A limited number of studies have investigated SARS - CoV - 2 seroprevalence in Northern Ireland to date . These include the ongoing COVID - 19 Infection Survey , which was initially piloted in England and subsequently extended to other devolved UK nations including Northern Ireland in September 2020 . A subset of the study participants provide blood samples for antibody testing , allowing seroprevalence rates to be closely tracked with updates published at regular intervals . Data indicated that in November 2020 , an estimated 3 . 3 % ( 95 % CI : 1 . 6 - 6 . 0 % ) of the Northern Ireland population would have tested seropositive for anti - SARS - CoV - 2 Ig , rising to 7 . 8 % ( 95 % CI : 3 . 5 - 14 . 4 % ) in December 2020 . 16 - 17 In comparison , the same time period was captured during round 2 of our study where seroprevalence was estimated at 5 . 2 % ( 95 % CI : 4 . 0 - 6 . 5 % ) . These figures are surprisingly similar despite the notable difference in sourcing sera for both studies ; either from hospital - based clinical biochemistry laboratories in our case , or from randomly selected private residential households throughout the general population for .

In another UK - wide multicentre study conducted between April to July 2020 , a seroprevalence of 0 . 9 % ( 95 % CI : 0 . 2 - 3 . 3 % ) was reported in children ( aged 2 - 15 years , N = 215 ) of healthcare workers based in Belfast . 18 This timeframe coincided with round 1 of our study , where 12 . 5 % of samples within this age bracket tested positive for anti - SARS - CoV - 2 Ig , although the low numbers involved ( N = 8 ) limit the robustness of these findings . In the round 3 cohort , neutralising antibodies were most frequently detected to spike and S1 RBD of the alpha ( B . 1 . 1 . 7 ) variant across most age groups , which was the predominant strain in the preceding winter and spring months of 2021 . 19 Since no record of vaccination or prior SARS - CoV - 2 infection was available , a more thorough interpretation of neutralising antibody persistence was not possible . However median concentration of neutralising antibodies directed toward spike protein WT and alpha variants were elevated in the 50 - 69 year olds relative to other age groups , whereas median concentrations of those directed against the S1 RBD WT and alpha variants were observed at higher levels in the over 70 year old group only . Also alpha variant specific neutralising antibodies were more frequently detected in the under 30 age group against S1 RBD than spike . These findings need confirmation in larger sized age groups with full vaccination and infection history , if high throughput ACE2 pseudoneutralisation assays are to be used to predict population protective immunity . The same ACE2 pseudoneutralisation assay has indicated that previous infection removed any negative influence of age or immune senescence on the level and quality of vaccine - induced immune responses in care home staff and patients . 20 However the round 3 data provide initial insight into age related variations in neutralising antibody diversity in response to likely variant .

However , similar to our sampling methodology , several studies also make use of existing residual sera from healthcare settings . 30 - 31 For example , a Scottish study between April and June 2020 reported a seroprevalence of 4 . 3 % ( 95 % CI : 4 . 2 - 4 . 5 % ) in residual samples from those accessing primary care via general practice . 32 This timeframe approximately correlated with round 1 of our study , where a similar seroprevalence of 3 . 9 % ( 95 % CI : 2 . 9 - 5 . 4 % ) was observed . Our choice of a ‘convenience’ sampling approach may have led to biased estimates of seroprevalence in our study . We identified residual sera from clinical biochemistry laboratories across Northern Ireland as a feasible sampling source , given that the routine processing of blood in this setting would facilitate access to sufficient sample numbers to address the urgent need for seroprevalence insights . However , with sera acquired from those accessing healthcare , it is possible that many of these individuals may have comorbidities that placed them at higher risk of severe infection . Such individuals may have been more likely to comply with preventive public health measures , potentially leading to a reduced incidence of .

A further limitation of our work relates to the demographic profile of the study population , which was not wholly representative of the Northern Ireland general population . Recent census data indicates that males and females comprise 49 % and 51 % of the Northern Ireland population , respectively . Gender misrepresentation was therefore apparent in our study , since sera were acquired from a disproportionate number of females ( N = 2679 ) versus males ( N = 2160 ) . Moreover , the age demographic of our study cohort did not reflect the Northern Ireland population at large , with 66 . 6 % of samples acquired from persons of 50 + years despite this age bracket only constituting 36 . 77 % of the overall population . 35 - 36 Although our estimates were adjusted in line with the true age and gender distribution of the Northern Ireland population , this may not fully mitigate sampling bias in our study . Our findings must therefore be interpreted with caution , especially in light of accumulating evidence that demographic characteristics can influence susceptibility to COVID - 19 . 38 - 40 In conclusion , our findings highlight the evolving trajectory of SARS - CoV - 2 in Northern Ireland , with seropositivity rates of < 15 % at three distinct timepoints suggesting that a significant proportion of the population had not yet naturally contracted the virus by mid - 2021 . Moreover , we report varying trends in seropositivity based on demographic factors , including age in particular where the highest rates were recorded in older generations in mid - 2020 before a shift to younger generations in mid - 2021 . Despite sampling constraints , our study fulfilled the critical need for seroprevalence data following the outbreak of SARS - CoV - 2 , .
