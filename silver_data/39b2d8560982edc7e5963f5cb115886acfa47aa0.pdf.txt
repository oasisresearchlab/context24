(cid:1) (cid:4)(cid:1) ABSTRACT Background : It is of paramount importance to understand the transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 in schools , which could support the decision - making about educational facilities closure or re - opening with effective prevention and control measures in place . Methods : We conducted a systematic review and meta - analysis to investigate the extent of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission in schools . We performed risk of bias evaluation of all included studies using the Newcastle - Ottawa Scale ( NOS ) . Results : 2 , 178 articles were retrieved and 11 studies were included . Five cohort studies reported a combined 22 student and 21 staff index cases that exposed 3 , 345 contacts with 18 transmissions [ overall infection attack rate ( IAR ) : 0 . 08 % ( 95 % CI : 0 . 00 % – 0 . 86 % ) ] . IARs for students and school staff were 0 . 15 % ( 95 % CI : 0 . 00 % – 0 . 93 % ) and 0 . 70 % ( 95 % CI : 0 . 00 % – 3 . 56 % ) respectively . Six cross - sectional studies reported 639 SARS - CoV - 2 positive cases in 6 , 682 study participants tested [ overall SARS - CoV - 2 positivity rate : 8 . 00 % ( 95 % CI : 2 . 17 % – 16 . 95 % ) ] . SARS - CoV - 2 positivity rate was estimated to be 8 . 74 % ( 95 % CI : 2 . 34 % – 18 . 53 % ) among students , compared to 13 . 68 % ( 95 % CI : 1 . 68 % – 33 . 89 % ) among school staff . Gender differences were not found for secondary infection ( OR : 1 . 44 , (cid:1) 95 % CI : 0 . 50 - 4 . 14 , P = 0 . 49 ) and SARS - CoV - 2 positivity ( OR : 0 . 90 , 95 % CI : 0 . 72 - 1 . 13 , P = 0 . 36 ) in schools . Fever , cough , dyspnea , ageusia , anosmia , rhinitis , sore throat , headache , (cid:1) myalgia , asthenia , and diarrhoea were all associated with the detection of SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies ( based on two studies ) . Overall , study quality was judged to be poor with risk of performance and attrition bias , limiting the confidence in the results . Conclusions : There is limited high - quality evidence available to quantify the extent of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission in schools or to compare it to community transmission . Emerging evidence suggests lower IAR and SARS - CoV - 2 positivity rate in students compared to school staff . Future prospective and adequately controlled cohort studies are necessary to confirm this finding . .

In response to the pandemic of novel COVID - 19 caused by a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) , 107 countries had implemented national school closures by March 18 2020 to reduce transmission [ 2 ] . Initial evidence suggests children have lower susceptibility and relatively small proportion of infections , compared to adults [ 3 ] . Children also have milder cases and better prognosis than adults [ 4 ] . According to data from 29 countries , the proportion of children among COVID - 19 cases varies from 0 . 3 % ( lowest in Spain ) up to 13 . 8 % ( highest in Argentina ) [ 5 ] . Many schools closed at the beginning of the COVID - 19 pandemic and therefore it is not known whether children are at risk of higher transmission in school settings compared to community settings . (cid:1) Multiple countries around the world have now re - opened schools for face - to - face teaching with varying non - pharmaceutical interventions ( NPIs ) in place including physical distancing measures , wearing of face masks , enhanced hand hygiene , reduced class sizes , and staggered class start and end times [ 6 ] . Evidence on SARS - CoV - 2 transmission in schools could support decision - making about schools / childcare facilities closure or re - opening with effective COVID - 19 prevention and control measures in place . A living systematic review to investigate the evidence of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission in the school environment is presented . We aim to keep updating this systematic review to include new studies as they become available and to re - evaluate the conclusions given the rapid pace of ongoing research . METHODS Protocol The protocol of this living systematic review was developed in accordance with the reporting guidance in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta - Analyses Protocols ( PRISMA - P ) statement [ 7 ] and was registered on PROSPERO ( register number : CRD42020192839 ) [ 8 ] . Literature search and eligibility criteria We ran a systematic search in MEDLINE , CINAHL , ERIC , Embase , WHO COVID - 19 database , medRxiv , The American Academy of Pediatrics ( AAP ) , The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health ( RCPCH ) , and Do not forget the bubbles websites with entry date limits from December 2019 to 14 July 2020 ( please see search strategies in Appendix S1 of the Online Supplementary Document ) , to identify studies that investigated SARS - CoV - 2 transmission in schools . We ran an updated search in MEDLINE up to 14 September 2020 . We further hand - searched reference lists of the retrieved eligible publications to identify additional relevant studies . We reviewed titles , abstracts , and subsequently full texts based on pre - defined inclusion and exclusion criteria following the population , exposure , comparison , outcome ( PECO ) approach . We included children ( defined as ≤18 years old ) who were attending school , and their close contacts ( family and household members , teachers , school support staff ) during the COVID - 19 pandemic . We excluded home - schooled children and their close contacts and schools with student numbers below 20 . For study outcomes , we included infections traced to a school index case with a COVID - 19 positive test . For study types , inclusion criteria spanned cohort studies regardless of active or passive follow - up in the exposed and non - exposed groups ( e . g . contact - tracing studies ) , viral genotyping studies , cross - sectional studies ( e . g . .

We included articles in peer - reviewed journals and pre - prints , and excluded comments , conference abstracts and interviews . Data extraction Data relevant to the evidence for SARS - CoV - 2 transmission in schools were extracted including : citation details , publication type , study design , country , region , city , investigation period , background population setting ( country / regional COVID - 19 prevalence rates where reported ) , types of non - pharmaceutical intervention in the background population setting , school closures at the time of the study , number of schools included , type of schools , size of schools , types of non - pharmaceutical interventions in place in schools , sampling method ( nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs / (cid:1) serum samples ) , provider testing versus self - testing , testing method ( PCR / SARS - CoV - 2 antibody testing ) , modality of follow - up , frequency of follow - up , case and contact demographics ( age and gender ) , clinical characteristics , number of index cases , number of contacts , number of secondary infected cases , infection attack rates ( IAR ) : no . of secondary infected cases / No . of contacts , number of participants tested for SARS - CoV - 2 , number of SARS - CoV - 2 positive cases , and SARS - CoV - 2 positivity rates : no . of positive cases / No . of participants tested . Data were extracted by one reviewer ( WX ) and checked by a second reviewer ( YH ) . Meta - analysis We pooled together SARS - CoV - 2 infection attack rates ( IAR ) and positivity rates using a random - effects model ( DerSimonian - Laird ) [ 9 ] . To account for zero cell counts , we transformed raw numbers / proportions with the Freeman - Tukey double arcine method to stabilize the variance [ 10 ] . We performed further random - effects meta - analyses ( DerSimonian - Laird ) of the association of SARS - CoV - 2 positivity with gender and clinical symptoms . Symptoms were further categorized as major ( fever , cough , dyspnoea , anosmia and ageusia ) or minor ( sore throat , rhinitis , myalgia , diarrhoea , headache , asthenia ) [ 22 - 23 ] . Heterogeneity among studies was tested using Cochran ' s Q statistic , the I 2 index , and the tau - squared test [ 11 ] . Funnel plots and the Egger test were used to detect evidence of publication bias [ 12 ] . P < 0 . 05 was considered as statistically significant ( two - sided ) . Assessment of methodological quality and risk of bias We applied the Newcastle Ottawa Scale ( NOS ) for controlled cohort studies to reflect the school setting [ 43 ] and used the NOS as a foundation to evaluate the quality of cross - sectional studies informed by earlier work [ 44 ] . The tools included an assessment of selection , measurement and attrition bias , and comparability . The tool is available in the supplementary materials ( Appendix S2 of the Online Supplementary Document ) . All statistical analyses were conducted using R , version 3 . 3 . 0 ( R Foundation for Statistical Computing ) . RESULTS .

After screening , 11 studies were eligible for inclusion ( Figure 1 ) , including five cohort studies [ 13 - 17 ] and six cross - sectional studies [ 18 - 23 ] . We did not identify viral genotyping studies . Characteristics and quality of the included studies The study characteristics of the 11 included studies are presented in Tables 1 and 2 . Cohort studies A cluster outbreak in schools was reported in Australia New South Wales ( NSW ) during 25 January - 9 April [ 17 ] . In NSW , 15 primary and secondary schools , and ten early childhood education and care ( ECEC ) settings had 27 primary SARS - CoV - 2 positive cases including 12 children and 15 school staff attending while infectious , with 1 , 448 contacts traced [ 17 ] . Secondary transmission was reported in three schools and one ECEC . Eighteen secondary infected cases were found among a total of 1 , 448 close contacts . IARs for primary school , secondary school , ECDC and overall were 0 . 92 % , 0 . 00 % , 2 . 25 % and 1 . 24 % respectively . Transmission rate of student - to - student was 0 . 31 % , and student - to - school staff was 0 . 97 % . By comparison , transmission rate of school staff - to - student was 1 . 49 % and school staff - to - school staff was 4 . 38 % . The remaining three studies in France ( Les Contamines - Montjoie ) , Ireland , and Singapore and a follow - up of the NSW Australian study indicated that the extent of any student - to - student and / or student - to - school staff transmission is limited [ 13 - 16 ] . In France ( Les Contamines - Montjoie ) , a 9 - year - old child attended three different schools while symptomatic , and of the 102 contacts identified , no secondary infections occurred [ 13 ] . A study in Ireland investigated SARS - CoV - 2 transmission in schools before school closures on 12 March and did not identify any cases of onward transmission to other students or school staff [ 14 ] . In this study , 6 primary COVID - 19 cases including three students , one teacher and two adult visitors who attended educational sessions were identified and 1 , 155 contacts ( 924 student contacts and 101 adult contacts ) were identified . During February and March , nationwide surveillance and contact - tracing in Singapore identified two SARS - CoV - 2 positive students ( 5 - year - old and 12 - year - old ) who attended pre - school and secondary school on the first day of their symptoms before subsequently being diagnosed with COVID - 19 , and one school staff who worked in a pre - school [ 15 ] . Screening of 119 students and staff who were close contacts ( secondary school : n = 8 ; pre - school 1 : n = 34 ; pre - school 2 : n = 77 ) did not detect any SARS - CoV - 2 infection . In the NSW follow - up study , ( school term 2 of the academic year between 10 April and 3 July ) , six SARS - CoV - 2 positive cases including four students and two school staff attended three primary schools , two high schools and one ECEC while infectious , and 521 contacts ( 459 student contacts and 62 adult contacts ) were identified [ 16 ] . No secondary infection was reported . Cross - sectional studies A study in Belgium measured the prevalence of SARS - CoV - 2 in randomly sampled 84 children attending eight daycare centres during the period 2 - 12 March , and found all analyzed samples were negative for SARS - CoV - 2 [ 21 ] . Four studies in Chile ( Vitacura , Santiago ) , Germany ( Saxony ) , and France ( Crépy - en - Valois ) identified antibody positive cases in schools , and overall seroprevalence varied from 0 . 01 % to 25 . 87 % [ 19 - 20 , 22 - 23 ] . .

Antibody positive rates were 9 . 91 % ( 100 / 1009 ) and 16 . 60 % ( 39 / 235 ) respectively . Antibody positive rates for pre - school , elementary school , middle school and high school were 12 . 24 % , 10 . 84 % , 11 . 80 % and 5 . 69 % . The peak rate was observed in pre - school . After reopening of schools in Germany ( Saxony ) on 18 May , 1 , 538 students from grade 8 – 11 and 507 teachers in 13 secondary schools were tested for SARS - CoV - 2 antibody to investigate their role in SARS - CoV - 2 transmission in schools [ 20 ] . The overall antibody positive rate was 0 . 58 % ( 12 / 2045 ) , and 0 . 72 % ( 11 / 1538 ) for student and 0 . 20 % ( 1 / 507 ) for school staff . In France ( Crépy - en - Valois ) , two sero - prevalence studies were conducted between 30 March - 30 April in one high school ( n = 661 ) and six primary schools ( n = 1340 ) [ 22 - 23 ] . Antibody positive rates were 25 . 87 % ( 171 / 661 ) in the high school and 10 . 37 % ( 139 / 1340 ) in primary schools . Specifically , seropositivity prevalence was 38 . 33 % ( 92 / 240 ) , 48 . 75 % ( 39 / 80 ) among students and staff in high school . By comparison , seropositivity prevalence was 8 . 82 % ( 45 / 510 ) , 5 . 71 % ( 4 / 70 ) among students and staff in primary schools . In Israel , ten days after schools reopened on 17 May , two index student cases were reported in a high school [ 18 ] . SARS - CoV - 2 real - time PCR tests were provided to 1 , 161 students and 151 school staff , a total of 178 positive cases ( overall positivity : 13 . 57 % ) including 153 students ( student positivity : 13 . 18 % ) and 25 school staff ( staff positivity : 16 . 56 % ) were identified . SARS - CoV - 2 positive rates were higher in junior grades for students aged 12 - 14 years old than in high grades for students aged 15 - 18 years old . The peak rates were observed in the 9th grade ( 14 year old , 32 . 62 % ) and the 7th grade ( 12 year old , 20 . 30 % ) . SARS - CoV - 2 infection attack rate We combined SARS - CoV - 2 IARs in schools in meta - analyses ( Table 3 ) . A total of five cohort studies early in pandemic before lockdown were included with 18 secondary infected cases in 3 , 345 contacts [ 13 - 17 ] . The pooled IAR of total study participants was calculated to be 0 . 08 % ( 95 % CI : 0 . 00 % – 0 . 86 % ) by using the Freeman - Tukey double arcine transformation and DerSimonian - Laird random - effects model ( Figure 2A ) . The heterogeneity in this meta - analysis was substantial with an I 2 value of 86 . 2 % . There was no evidence of publication bias ( Egger’s test p = 0 . 661 ; Figure 2B , 2C ) . We estimated the pooled IARs for students and school staff separately , [ 0 . 15 % ( 95 % CI : 0 . 00 % – 0 . 93 % ) and 0 . 70 % ( 95 % CI : 0 . 00 % – 3 . 56 % ) respectively ; Figure 3A and 4A ] . Heterogeneity was high and there was no evidence of publication bias ( Figure 3B , 3C and 4B , 4C ) . SARS - CoV - 2 positivity rate We also meta - analyzed SARS - CoV - 2 positivity rates in schools ( Table 4 ) from a total of six cross - sectional studies which included 639 SARS - CoV - 2 positive cases in 6 , 682 participants tested [ 18 - 23 ] . The result of the random effect meta - analysis showed that the pooled SARS - CoV - 2 positivity rate of total study participants was 8 . 00 % ( 95 % CI : 2 . 17 % – 16 . 95 % ) with substantial heterogeneity ( I 2 = 99 . 2 % ) ( Figure 5A ) , but no evidence of publication bias ( Figure 5B , 5C ) . Specifically , the positivity rates of SARS - CoV - 2 was estimated to be 8 . 74 % ( 95 % CI : 2 . 34 % – 18 . 53 % ) among students ( Figure 6A ) , compared to 13 . 68 % ( 95 % CI : 1 . 68 % – 33 . 89 % ) among school staff ( Figure 7A ) . Heterogeneity was reported with I 2 value of 98 . 9 % and 98 . 1 % . Funnel plot with Egger’s test ( P = 0 . 498 and 0 . 129 ) suggested that there was no notable evidence of publication bias ( Figure 6B , 6C and 7B , 7C ) .

Clinical symptoms We also explored symptoms association with SARS - CoV - 2 positivity ( Table 6 ) . Symptoms data was available from two sero - prevalence studies for both students and staff [ 22 - 23 ] . Study participants who had experienced major symptoms were more likely to test positive , compared to those who had had minor or no symptoms ( 27 . 09 % , 10 . 98 % , and 8 . 98 % , respectively , P < 0 . 001 ) . Fever , cough , dyspnea , ageusia , anosmia , rhinitis , sore throat , headache , (cid:1) myalgia , asthenia , and diarrhoea were all associated with the detection of SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies ( Table 6 ) . The most frequently reported symptoms were anosmia 84 . 27 % ( 95 % CI : 76 . 64 - 90 . 59 % ) , ageusia 79 . 58 % ( 95 % CI : 58 . 86 - 94 . 50 % ) , myalgia 30 . 61 % ( 95 % CI : 11 . 05 - 54 . 74 % ) , fever 29 . 88 % ( 95 % CI : 8 . 32 - 57 . 73 % ) , and diarrhoea 29 . 15 % ( 95 % CI : 8 . 74 - 55 . 32 % ) . Study quality We considered contact - tracing studies as potential controlled cohort studies with the contacts of the index case representing the exposed group and the non - contacts who were in the school environment representing the unexposed group ( a proxy community control group ) . Studies performed well in terms of representativeness of the groups and comparability . All studies employed active symptom screening in the exposed group with four of five studies employing passive or no screening in the unexposed groups and no testing . This difference in screening and testing introduces a risk of measurement bias . In a single study of three schools in Singapore [ 15 ] , both the exposed and unexposed groups underwent PCR testing regardless of symptoms . Follow - up rates were reported for the exposed groups with less than 80 % follow - up for all studies introducing a high risk of attrition bias across studies ( Table 7 ) . For cross - sectional studies , we noted that while the sample for the target school population was representative , four out of six studies experienced poor response rates , introducing selection bias . Studies performed variably across other domains ( Table 8 ) . DISCUSSION This systematic review summarizes the most recently available evidence to understand SARS - CoV - 2 transmission in schools and includes an assessment of study quality to aid interpretation . The results from cohort and cross - sectional studies found that the overall IAR and SARS - CoV - 2 positivity rate in school settings are low , and confirmed that students reported both lower IAR and SARS - CoV - 2 positivity rate compared to school staff . However , the quality of studies limits our confidence in the observed results . Cohort studies reported limited evidence of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission in school settings . Compiling the data from five studies of school exposures early in pandemic before lockdown , we report an overall IAR of 0 . 08 % ( 95 % CI : 0 . 00 % – 0 . 86 % ) . Clusters in educational facilities were identified in one of the five reporting countries , and those that occurred were limited in number and size [ 17 ] . NSW did not close schools during the beginning of COVID - 19 pandemic . Transmission rates of student - to - student , student - to - staff , staff - to - student and staff - to - staff were 0 . 31 % , 0 . 97 % , 1 . 49 % and 4 . 38 % respectively . Students reported lower IAR than school staff . In addition , there is uncertainty about in which grade school children are more likely susceptible to and transmit SARS - CoV - 2 . IARs for ECDC ( < 6 years old ) , primary school ( 6 - 12 years old ) , and secondary school ( 12 - 18 years old ) were 2 . 25 % , 0 . 92 % , 0 . 00 % respectively in NSW . The data is limited to reach a consensus . However , the clusters in NSW demonstrated that classroom crowding and other factors related to physical distancing may play a role in the spread of SARS - CoV - 2 under the school environment . .

The remaining four studies in France ( Les Contamines - Montjoie ) , Ireland , Singapore , Australia ( NSW ) reported that transmission rate from student - to - student , student - to - staff , staff - to - student and staff - to - staff was 0 . 00 % [ 13 - 16 ] . The limited evidence available to quantify the extent of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission in school settings , reflects the fact that cluster outbreaks have been studied and reported relatively infrequently in schools to date . Effective implementation of NPIs such as physical distancing , small - size class , cancellation of mass gatherings , and hand hygiene is likely to further limit our ability to study school transmission [ 6 ] . Cross - sectional studies estimated the proportion of SARS - CoV - 2 positive cases , to give an insight into how many people have been infected in schools . As described above , the positivity results in the general study population under school environment varied from 0 . 00 ( lowest in eight daycare centers in Belgium ) to 25 . 87 % ( highest in one high school in France ) , which is likely to reflect the community positivity rate at the time the study was conducted [ 18 - 23 ] . The lower positivity rate in students suggested that students are less susceptible to infection and / or less frequently infected than adult school staff , which indicated that students are not at higher risk of causing super - spreading events in schools . Our finding is in line with many previous studies comparing sero - prevalence between children and adults [ 27 - 31 ] . However , the quality of the included studies is low and we should interpret the result with caution . Sero - prevalence results from Sweden in which schools remained open , demonstrated that 5 - 19 year olds ( 6 . 0 % , 95 % CI 2 . 3 - 10 . 2 % ) children had similar sero - prevalence to 20 - 49 year olds ( 8 . 5 % , 95 % CI 4 . 99 - 11 . 7 ) adults [ 32 ] . We suggest more specialised and large - scale sero - surveillence studies need to be conducted to monitor SARS - CoV - 2 infection during school opening . In addition , there is no consensus about in which grade school children have higher susceptibility to SARS - CoV - 2 Infection . SARS - CoV - 2 positive rates for pre - school ( < 6 years old ) , primary school ( 6 - 12 years old ) , middle school and high school ( 12 - 18 years old ) were 12 . 24 % , 10 . 84 % , 11 . 80 % and 5 . 69 % in Chile ( Santiago ) . The peak rate was observed in pre - school . By comparison , SARS - CoV - 2 positive rates were 8 . 82 % in primary schools ( 6 - 12 years old ) in France ( Crépy - en - Valois ) , and were 0 . 72 % in middle schools ( 12 - 16 years old ) in Germany ( Saxony ) , and 38 . 33 % in high schools ( 12 - 18 years old ) in France , 13 . 18 % in high schools ( 12 - 18 years old ) in Israel . A single study in Israel investigated whether school transmission increased relative to community transmission . Compared with the school - closure period , the total number of COVID - 19 cases increased , and the proportion of infected children increased from 19 . 8 % to 40 . 9 % in the community . However , the role of school in the significant COVID - 19 increase in the community was unclear because school re - opening coincided with the relaxation of other prevention and control measures [ 18 ] . We did not find any gender differences for secondary infection and SARS - CoV - 2 positivity in schools . The lack of sex - disaggregated data for student and school staff specifically in the reviewed studies enhanced the difficulty to further explore potential explanations for the findings in gender . The main clinical symptoms for COVID - 19 patients were anosmia ( 84 . 3 % ) , ageusia ( 79 . 9 % ) , myalgia ( 30 . 6 % ) , fever ( 29 . 9 % ) , diarrhoea ( 29 . 2 % ) , dyspnea ( 28 . 6 % ) , and cough ( 22 . 9 % ) . We should interpret the result with caution because the symptom data only come from two sero - surveillance studies carried out in one high school ( n = 661 ) and six primary schools ( n = 1340 ) in France ( Crépy - en - Valois ) . Studies from Italy [ 33 - 35 ] , Germany [ 36 ] , UK [ 37 ] , Turkey [ 38 ] and Sweden [ 39 ] also reported similar clinical symptoms in children . In addition to common respiratory symptoms , gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea were present in around 25 % of pediatric patients [ 24 ] . It is noted that the persistent shedding of SARS - CoV - 2 in stools of infected children has been consistently reported , showing that SARS - CoV - 2 may be present in the gastrointestinal tract for a longer duration than viral presence in the respiratory system , compared to adults [ 40 - 42 ] . .

In addition , we estimated pooled IARs and SARS - CoV - 2 positivity rates for students and school staff , and to our best knowledge , this is the first meta - analyses conducted , to investigate what is the rate of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission in schools . However , the following potential limitations should be considered . First , further interpretation of age - group differences in IARs and positivity rates could not be performed because 80 . 0 % ( 4 / 5 ) of included cohort studies and 50 . 0 % ( 3 / 6 ) of included cross - sectional studies did not specify the ages of students and school staff . The remaining four included studies did not provide the raw data and we could not unify different age groups to run the meta - analysis . Second , cross - comparisons between IARs and positivity rates reported in different regions / countries is difficult because of differences in the sampling and testing methods used , timing of the studies in relation to the outbreak , response measures and underlying community transmission . Moreover , the differences may contribute to the heterogeneity observed in the meta - analyses results and raise methodological concerns around the validity of the meta - analysis . Due to the limited number of included studies , we could not conduct subgroup meta - analyses to further investigate the heterogeneity . As this is a living review , we anticipate that with the addition of more , well - conducted studies over time , heterogeneity may improve . Third , only two studies in the included 11 studies ( 18 . 2 % ) reported prevention and control measures in place in schools such as class size , physical distancing , and staggered class start and end times , making it difficult to further investigate the effectiveness of NPIs under the school environment . Forth , only one study ( 9 . 1 % ) compared school transmission rate with community transmission rate . Few studies have assessed the impact of school opening on transmission outside the school . Thus , we additionally searched study’s background sero - prevalence or SARS - CoV - 2 case rate per 100 , 000 population online , however , the data is limited . We suggest future studies could investigate this research question : does school increase or decrease transmission to the community . Fifth , although there is no evidence for publication bias , the number of included studies were less than ten . When there are fewer studies , the power of the tests is too low to distinguish chance from real asymmetry . Therefore , results should be interpreted with caution . Lastly , the majority of included studies are pre - print publications and have not been peer - reviewed . The quality of the included studies is low and we should interpret the results with caution . CONCLUSION In conclusion , although there is limited evidence available to quantify the extent of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission in schools , the balance of evidence so far indicates that the overall IAR and SAR - CoV - 2 positivity rate in the school environment are low . Specifically , lower IAR and positivity rates were reported in students compared to school staff , but poor study quality limits our overall confidence in these results . However , it is important to implement effective NPIs such as physical distancing , small - size class to prevent schools from becoming a setting for accelerating onward transmission during the re - opening of schools .
