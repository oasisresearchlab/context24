INTRODUCTION The endocytic pathway deﬁnes membrane traffic from the plasma membrane to the degradative compartment : the lysosome in animal cells and the vacuole in fungi and plants . All eukaryotic cells studied thus far are able to internalize extracellular components as well as components of their plasma membrane . A portion of the lipid bilayer engulfs the surrounding extracellular macromolecules and sequesters them through formation of an endocytic vesicle that detaches from the plasma membrane . Some of the internalized substances are then delivered to the lysosome / vacuole after passage through two endocytic compartments termed early and late endosomes . The original description of this route relied mainly on extensive morphological studies of animal cells . Later development of assays to quantitatively measure endocytic traffic ( in vivo and in vitro ) allowed more fundamental questions about the molecular mechanism to be addressed . Only recently , genetic approaches have been applied to its study using Drosophila melanogaster , Dictyostelium discoideum and Saccharomyces cerevisiae . Isolation and characterization of Saccharomyces cerevesiae mutants blocked in the endocytic pathway has been especially productive during the last few years regarding the identiﬁcation of molecules involved in the internalization step at the plasma membrane . An earlier , cursory examination of the requirements for endocytosis in yeast and animal cells did not point to a common endocytic mechanism . Therefore , use of yeast as a model to study higher eukaryotic endocytosis was brought into doubt ( Trowbridge et al . , 1993 ) . However , recent advances in the understanding of both systems reveals much stronger connections than originally thought . The fundamental differences between the approaches used in the different systems might be of great importance for further development of the ﬁeld , as it has been for study of the secretory pathway . The general organization of endocytic traffic inside yeast cells resembles that of mammalian cells . Both early and late endosomes have been morphologically and biochemically identiﬁed ( Singer - Krüger et al . , 1993 ; Hicke et al . , 1997 ; Prescianotto - Baschong and Riezman , 1998 ) , and the molecular machinery required for transport to proceed does not seem to differ fundamentally ( Riezman et al . , 1996 ) . However , lack of exhaustive ultrastructural studies and quantitative assays that measure post - internalization steps in yeast make comparison between the two systems difficult . In contrast , the internalization step in yeast can be monitored quantitatively by measuring uptake of radiolabeled a - factor pheromone after binding to its receptor , Ste2p ( Dulic et al . , 1991 ) , facilitating the identiﬁcation and characterization of several genetic requirements of this event . 1031 Journal of Cell Science 111 , 1031 - 1037 ( 1998 ) Printed in Great Britain © The Company of Biologists Limited 1998 JCS4543 The internalization step of endocytosis has been the focus of several laboratories during the last forty years . Unlike some other budding events in the cell , many fundamental questions regarding the molecular machinery involved in the mechanism of budding itself still remain unsolved . Over the last few years the general picture of the ﬁeld has quickly evolved from the originally simplistic view which postulated that clathrin polymerization is the major force driving budding at the plasma membrane . Reﬁnement of the assays and molecular markers to measure endocytosis in animal cells has shown that other factors in addition to the clathrin coat are required and that endocytosis can also take place through clathrin - independent mechanisms . At the same time , recent introduction of genetic approaches to study endocytosis has accelerated the identiﬁcation of molecules required for this process . The isolation of endocytosis mutants in budding yeast has been especially fruitful in this respect . Preliminary comparison of the results obtained in yeast and animal cells did not seem to coincide , but further progress in both systems now suggests that part of the divergence originally seen may be due to the particular experimental approaches used rather than fundamental differences in endocytic mechanisms . In this review we present a short historical overview on the advances made in yeast and animal cells regarding the study of endocytosis , underlining both emerging similarities and still interesting differences .

INTERNALIZATION IN ANIMAL CELLS Several morphologically and mechanistically different types of endocytic internalization occur in mammalian cells : phagocytosis is responsible for the uptake of solid particles , pinocytosis for the endocytosis of extracellular ﬂuid , macromolecules and solutes . Pinocytosis can further be subdivided into macropinocytosis , which is associated with the formation of relatively large vacuoles that are heterogeneous in size and shape ( 0 . 5 - 200 m m ) , and micropinocytosis which occurs through the generation of small vesicles ( 50 to 150 nm ) . Phagocytosis and macropinocytosis are triggered in specialized cells in response to speciﬁc stimuli and they will not therefore be the main subject of this review . Pinocytosis of bulk solutes is generally referred to as ﬂuid - phase endocytosis . In contrast , receptor - mediated endocytosis deﬁnes the adsorptive uptake of speciﬁc macromolecules bound to plasma membrane receptors . The ﬁrst insight into the mechanism of endocytosis came from electron microscopy studies . Electron - dense coated invaginations were discovered at the plasma membrane in insect oocytes that accumulated yolk proteins and appeared to give rise to endocytic coated vesicles ( CV ) ( Roth and Porter , 1964 ) . CVs were isolated from brain tissue and shown to be coated with a polygonal lattice whose main component is clathrin ( Pearse , 1975 ; Crowther et al . , 1976 ) . Later , coated pits and vesicles of mammalian cells were shown to be enriched in membrane receptors carrying endocytosis signals ( Anderson et al . , 1977a , b ) . The clathrin coat has been the subject of extensive biochemical characterization . A triskelion of three clathrin heavy chains tightly associated with three clathrin light chains constitutes the assembly unit of the polygonal lattice . A heterotetramer ( AP - 2 ) consisting of two large ( a and b ) and two small ( s 2 and m 2 ) subunits mediates assembly of clathrin cages on the plasma membrane ( Pearse and Robinson , 1990 ; Schmid , 1992 ) . The b subunit interacts with clathrin ( Ahle and Ungewickell , 1989 ) , whereas the m 2 subunit is capable of binding the tyrosine - based endocytic signals that mediate clathrin - dependent internalization of a number of membrane proteins ( Ohno et al . , 1995 ; Marks et al . , 1997 ; Robinson , 1997 ) . The fact that puriﬁed clathrin spontaneously forms coat - like structures that resemble those found at the plasma membrane suggests that clathrin oligomerization may be the major driving force generating endocytic vesicles . Inhibition of transferrin ( Tfn ) and liposome uptake by microinjection of antibodies against clathrin or a adaptin in living cells further supported their direct involvement in endocytosis ( Chin et al . , 1989 ) . However , development of assays that differentially measured coat assembly , invagination and vesicle ﬁssion in vivo and in vitro ( Schmid , 1992 ) demonstrated that additional energy requirements exist and most likely other proteins are involved . Growth and invagination of planar coats already assembled at the plasma membrane can take place in the absence of ATP . However , ATP depletion blocks the ﬁssion event , causing accumulation of constricted coated pits connected to the cell surface through thin necks ( Smythe et al . , 1989 ; Schmid and Carter , 1990 ; Schmid and Smythe , 1991 ) . On the other hand , growth and invagination of clathrin lattices is inhibited in the presence of GDP b S whereas the ﬁssion event is blocked by GTP g S indicating that invagination requires GTP binding whereas ﬁssion requires hydrolysis ( Carter et al . , 1993 ) . These results suggested that at least one GTPase might be required . Shortly afterwards , the involvement of the GTPase , dynamin , was demonstrated . Dynamin was identiﬁed as the product of the Shibire gene of Drosophila ( van der Bliek and Meyerowitz , 1991 ; Chen et al . , 1991 ) . Flies bearing a temperature sensitive ( ts ) mutation in this gene are paralyzed after short incubation at the restrictive temperature ( Grigliatti et al . , 1973 ) , their synapses are depleted of vesicles and accumulate constricted pits ( Kosaka and Ikeda , 1983 ) . In cultured cells , overexpression of a mutant dynamin , that is unable to bind GTP , inhibits Tfn and epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) internalization blocking coated vesicle budding in an intermediate stage before constriction of the neck ( van der Bliek et al . , 1993 ; Damke et al . , 1994 ) . Wild - type dynamin is localized homogeneously on planar and shallowly invaginated clathrin coated pits , but it concentrates at the neck of deeply invaginated constricted pits . In contrast , mutant dynamin fails to relocate ( Damke et al . , 1994 ; Warnock and Schmid , 1996 ) . Additionally , nerve terminals incubated with GTP g S accumulate long tubular invaginations bearing transverse electron dense rings that can be decorated with dynamin antibodies and are often capped with coated pits ( Takei et al . , 1995 ) . Puriﬁed dynamin can self assemble into rings and stacks of interconnected rings under certain conditions ( Hinshaw and Schmid , 1995 ) . Additionally , the high GTP affinity and hydrolysis rate of dynamin make this molecule much more similar to the mechanochemical enzymes than to the classical GTPases that work as molecular switches of different cellular process ( Warnock and Schmid , 1996 ) . This growing body of data has been used to suggest that after GDP / GTP exchange , dynamin might constrict the invaginated coated pits while polymerizing at their neck . GTP hydrolysis might ﬁnally trigger a conformational switch that could promote vesicle ﬁssion ( Warnock and Schmid , 1996 ) . Whereas there is evidence for the involvement of dynamin in coated pit constriction , no direct experiments address its role in the ﬁssion event itself . GTP promotes depolymerization of the in vitro oligomerized dynamin rings . It is therefore possible that GTP g S inhibits release of dynamin from the constricted neck preventing the binding of other proteins that are required for the ﬁssion event . The additional ATP requirement in this late event may suggest the involvement of other key players . Even though the involvement of clathrin in micropinocytosis is convincing , growing evidence indicates that both ﬂuid - phase and receptor - mediated endocytosis can take place under conditions that prevent clathrin polymerization ( Lamaze and Schmid , 1995 ) . In fact , the discovery of non - coated pits and vesicles preceded the discovery of CVs by about one decade ( Palade , 1953 ) . Still , however , very little is known about the cargo and the molecular machinery involved in clathrin - independent pinocytic pathways . The best characterized of these alternative endocytic routes is internalization through caveolae . Caveolae are ﬂask - shaped invaginations of 50 - 80 nm in diameter and are highly abundant in epithelial cells that have M . I . Geli and H . Riezman 1033 Endocytic internalization in yeast and animal cells been proposed to participate in transcytosis ( Schnitzer et al . , 1994 ) . Planar freeze - fracture views reveal a spiral - shaped coat surrounding caveolae which is very different from clathrin lattices ( Rothberg et al . , 1992 ) . Caveolae can be identiﬁed by the presence of a 21 kDa integral membrane protein called caveolin ( Rothberg et al . , 1992 ) and are enriched in sphingolipids and cholesterol ( Parton , 1996 ) . Whether endocytic uptake really occurs through caveolae has been a matter of debate for a long time . However , in vivo data showing caveolae - dependent internalization of cholera toxin B ( Tran et al . , 1987 ) , GPI - anchored horseradish peroxidase ( Parton et al . , 1994 ) or simian virus 40 ( SV40 ) ( Stang et al . , 1997 ) , as well as recent development of an in vitro assay to measure caveolae budding ( Schnitzer et al . , 1996 ) leave little doubt about their capacity to detach from the cell surface . It is not clear how different the molecular machinery implicated in caveolae - dependent , clathrin - independent pinocytosis is from that described above . Caveolae budding in vitro also requires cytosol and ATP , and budding in vitro or in vivo is inhibited by GTP g S ( Schnitzer et al . , 1996 ) . Recent data suggest that dynamin might also be required for caveolae ﬁssion ( Oh and Schnitzer , 1996 ) . Furthermore , it is worth noting that overexpression of caveolin in lymphoblastoid cells that do not normally express it causes accumulation of these structures ( Fra et al . , 1995 ) , indicating that any additional molecular machinery involved in their formation and possibly their budding is already present in these cells . INTERNALIZATION IN YEAST The study of yeast endocytosis is relatively young compared with studies in mammalian cells and the original approach is fundamentally different : genes that are not essential for viability can easily be deleted from the yeast genome to directly address their requirement in a given cellular process . However , the question often remains of whether an effect observed is a direct or indirect consequence of the gene deletion . This problem , as well as addressing the function of essential genes can be overcome by using thermosensitive ( ts ) or other conditional alleles that are only inactivated at a given temperature or under certain conditions . Rapid installation of a defect after shift to the restrictive condition is normally considered to be good evidence supporting a direct role for the corresponding protein in that process . Development of an assay that speciﬁcally measures the uptake step of receptor mediated endocytosis in yeast ( see above ) permitted the identiﬁcation of potential genes that are required for this event . A candidate protein to be tested was the main component of the clathrin coat : the clathrin heavy chain . Surprisingly , deletion of the only gene encoding this protein ( CHC1 ) or its inactivation using a ts allele , only caused a 50 % reduction in the a - factor internalization rate ( Tan et al . , 1993 ) . Even though the installation of the internalization defect in the chc1 ts mutant is quite rapid , the data depicted above brought into doubt whether receptor - mediated internalization in yeast was analogous to clathrin - dependent endocytosis in mammalian cells . In addition , identiﬁcation of a lysine - dependent endocytosis signal in the a - factor receptor that did not resemble the classical tyrosine - based mammalian signals further supported this view ( Rohrer et al . , 1993 ) . In order to search for other requirements , several available mutants were tested and different screening procedures to isolate endocytosis mutants ( end , ren , dim mutants ) were set up in the next years ( Chvatchko et al . , 1986 ; Davis et al . , 1993 ; Raths et al . , 1993 ; Munn and Riezman , 1994 ; Wendland et al . , 1996 ; Luo and Chang , 1997 ) . Identiﬁcation of proteins speciﬁcally required in the uptake step has been especially fruitful ( Table 1 ) . The initial analysis of these mutants revealed two fundamental aspects of the internalization process in yeast largely unnoticed in animal cells : the requirement for actin and a subset of actin - associated proteins , and the involvement of certain lipids ( Table 1 ) . The requirement of actin in the internalization of Ste2p seems to be direct for a number of reasons : ( 1 ) different actin ts alleles are completely blocked for receptor - mediated and ﬂuid - phase endocytosis immediately after shift to the restrictive temperature before other obvious defects in actin - dependent functions are installed ( Kübler and Riezman , 1993 ) . ( 2 ) A subset of proteins associated with the actin cytoskeleton such as the actin bundling protein Sac6p , calmodulin or the type I myosins are also required in the process ( Table 1 ) , however , this machinery seems to be very speciﬁc since mutations in many other genes with gross defects in the actin cytoskeleton do not affect endocytosis ( tropomyosin , myosins V , proﬁlin . . . ) ( Riezman et al . , 1996 ) . ( 3 ) Analysis of a collection of ts actin mutants ( Wertman et al . , 1992 ) reveals that different actin - dependent functions are Table 1 .

I . Geli , unpublished data ) . The second exciting and as yet unexplored mechanistic aspect of the endocytic internalization has been revealed by the cloning and sequencing of two END genes blocked in the uptake step of endocytosis : END8 encodes an enzyme involved in ceramide biosynthesis ( LCB1 ) and END11 encodes a gene involved in the synthesis of ergosterol ( ERG2 ) , the major yeast sterol ( Riezman et al . , 1996 ) ( Table 1 ) . IS INTERNALIZATION IN YEAST AND ANIMAL CELLS SO DIFFERENT ? Up to this point endocytosis in animals and yeast seemed to appear rather different , however , further insight into both systems in the last few years has highlighted some striking similarities and some fundamental differences . One difference between clathrin - dependent endocytosis in animal cells and endocytosis in yeast is that no dynamin - like proteins seem to be involved in the uptake step in yeast . Three different genes have been identiﬁed in the yeast genome that share some homology to animal dynamins : Mgm1p , Vps1p and Dnm1p . Mgm1p is a mitochondrial protein involved in mitochondrial DNA maintenance ( Jones and Fangman , 1992 ) . Vps1p and Dnm1p are both involved in membrane traffic , Golgi to vacuole and early to late endosome , respectively ( Vater et al . , 1992 ; Gammie et al . , 1995 ) . Strains deleted for either DNM1 or VPS1 do not show any internalization defect ( Gammie et al . , 1995 ; Alan Munn , personal communication ) suggesting that they are not involved in the process . The possibility still exists that these proteins are redundant for their endocytic internalization function , in which case a defect would only be noticed by introducing mutations in both genes . Whether they are true functional homologs of dynamin is not clear . Their homology lies mainly in the GTPase domain and they lack an important portion of the C - terminal tail that seems to be important for self assembly , binding to membranes and stimulated GTPase activity ( Warnock and Schmid , 1996 , and references therein ) . If dynamin works as a mechanochemical enzyme in endocytosis , a possible replacement has recently been identiﬁed in yeast : the unconventional myosins I ( Geli and Riezman , 1996 ) . Myosins I are ubiquitous actin / ATP - dependent molecular motors that bind cellular membranes through their short , positively - charged C - terminal tail ( Pollard et al . , 1991 ; Cheney and Mooseker , 1992 ) . Extensive biochemical analysis has been performed on mammalian and protozoa myosins I , and some of their features strikingly resemble those of dynamin . They both hydrolyze a similar number of nucleotide molecules per minute and their nucleotidase activity is modulated in vitro through binding to acidic phospholipids , Ca 2 + and phosphorylation events ( Pollard et al . , 1991 ; Cheney and Mooseker , 1992 ; Warnock and Schmid , 1996 ) . Type I myosins are additionally assembled with light chains . In yeast , Myo5p requires calmodulin as a light chain for its function in the endocytic internalization step ( Geli et al . , 1998 ) . A second striking feature of the endocytic internalization in yeast when compared to animal cells is the mild requirement for clathrin in that organism . Clathrin coated pits and vesicles have not yet been identiﬁed ultrastructurally in yeast and therefore the possibility still exists that the effect observed in chc1 mutants is indirect and is caused by primary defects in other membrane trafficking events . However , several pieces of evidence indicate that this is not the case : ( 1 ) some of the isolated end mutants affect genes sharing homology with recently identiﬁed mammalian proteins associated with clathrin / dynamin function ( eps15 and amphiphysin ) . ( 2 ) Further insights in the analysis of the endocytic signals in yeast and mammals demonstrate some important common features . The END3 and PAN1 / DIM2 ( Table 1 ) N - terminal portions share homology to the recently identiﬁed EGF receptor kinase substrate , eps15 ( Fazioli et al . , 1993 ; Bénédetti et al . , 1994 ; Wendland et al . , 1996 ; Tang et al . , 1997 ) . They contain an imperfect repeat of about 70 amino acids with an overall 60 % homology : the EH ( Eps15 homology ) domain ( Wong et al . , 1994 , 1995 ) . The role of Eps15 in clathrin - mediated endocytosis is strongly suggested by its interaction with a adaptin ( Benmerah et al . , 1995 , 1996 ) and its recent ultrastructural localization to the rim of coated pits ( Tebar et al . , 1996 ) . The function of the EH domain is unknown ; this domain does not seem to be required for binding to a adaptin ( Benmerah et al . , 1996 ) , but has recently been shown to bind proteins with an NPF motif ( Salcini et al . , 1997 ) . Other END genes with signiﬁcant homology to mammalian clathrin / dynamin - associated counterparts are END6 / RVS161 and RVS167 ( Table 1 ) . They share homology to the neuronal amphiphysin identiﬁed as the major autoantigen in the stiff - Man syndrome ( David et al . , 1994 ) . Amphiphysin interacts both with dynamin and clathrin ( David et al . , 1996 ; McMahon et al . , 1997 ) . The functional signiﬁcance of the amphiphysin - dynamin interaction has recently been elegantly demonstrated . Microinjection of peptides corresponding to the amphiphysin and dynamin interacting domains into neurons inhibited synaptic vesicle endocytosis at the stage of invaginated clathrin - coated pits ( Shupliakov et al . , 1997 ) . Additionally , an important insight into the mechanism involved in the lysine - mediated internalization of the a - factor receptor revealed that functionally analogous signals may also play a role in clathrin - dependent endocytosis in animal cells . The lysine residue undergoes ubiquitination in response to ligand binding . Preventing ubiquitination either by a point mutation in the receptor or by mutations in the ubiquitination machinery abolished receptor uptake , therefore demonstrating its role as an endocytic signal ( Hicke and Riezman , 1996 ) . Ubiquitination of plasma membrane receptors is also a common phenomenon in mammalian cells . Many growth factor receptors receive ubiquitin upon binding to their ligands ( Riezman et al . , 1996 , and references therein ) . In particular , the ubiquitination machinery has been proposed to be required for internalization of the growth hormone receptor which occurs through clathrin - coated pits ( Strous et al . , 1996 ) . Two new yeast endocytosis signals that resemble those that mediate clathrin - dependent internalization of mammalian proteins have recently been identiﬁed : The NPFSD and NPF peptides ( similar to FDNPVY of the LDL receptor ) present in the yeast Kex2p and Ste3p , respectively , are sufficient to trigger internalization . Uptake of these two proteins is dependent on clathrin and other END genes to a similar extent as Ste2p which depends upon ubiquitination , suggesting that a similar endocytic machinery is involved in their uptake ( Tan et al . , 1996 ) . On the other hand , the general amino acid permease bears a dileucine M . I . Geli and H . Riezman 1035 Endocytic internalization in yeast and animal cells sequence similar to the mammalian endocytic dileucine signals ( Aiken et al . , 1994 ) and which is required for its downregulation . In addition , ubiquitination of Gap1p is also apparently required for its internalization ( Hein and André , 1997 ) . How can one explain the partial effect of clathrin mutants in endocytosis in yeast ? Two hypothesis are consistent with the accumulated data . The ﬁrst one postulates that clathrin is not essential for the budding process itself but functions to recruit receptors . In this context , deleting clathrin heavy chain would diminish the efficiency of , but not abolish , receptor - mediated endocytosis . An alternative possibility would postulate that at least two endocytic pathways exist in yeast , one that is clathrin - and actin - dependent and another that is clathrin - independent , but still actin - dependent . As mentioned above , clathrin - independent endocytic pathways have been described in mammalian cells . Some interesting mechanistic parallels can be drawn between caveolar uptake and endocytosis in yeast . Caveolae structure and function seem to be dependent on actin and cholesterol in analogy to the endocytic internalization in yeast . Actin depolymerizing and cholesterol sequestering drugs both disturb caveolae structure and prevent internalization through this pathway ( Schnitzer et al . , 1994 ; Parton et al . , 1994 ) . It is worth noting that no caveolin homolog has been identiﬁed in the yeast genome , however , there are to date no data demonstrating that caveolin itself is a fundamental component of the machinery required for internalization though caveolae . It is also possible that this protein causes the accumulation of non - clathrin coated endocytic vesicles at the plasma membrane by preventing their ﬁssion . Many GPI anchored proteins seem to be internalized through caveolae upon antibody crosslinking in an actin and cholesterol dependent manner ( Parton et al . , 1994 ; Schnitzer et al . , 1994 ) . Interestingly , the GPI - anchored protein CD59 is internalized with the same requirements in lymphoblastoids cells ( Deckert et al . , 1996 ) , which as previously mentioned do not express endogenous caveolin but accumulate caveolae structures when this protein is overexpressed ( Fra et al . , 1995 ) . In contrast to the important role of clathrin in mammalian internalization versus its controversial role in yeast , actin is clearly required to support endocytosis in yeast whereas its involvement in mammalian cells has been a matter of debate for a long time . The actin requirement for clathrin - dependent and - independent internalization in mammalian cells has been addressed by analyzing the effect of actin depolymerizing drugs such as cytochalasin derivates . The results obtained seem to be conﬂicting and to depend on the cell type and the assay utilized to assess the endocytic defect . Fluid - phase endocytosis was inhibited by these drugs in different cell types ( Wagner et al . , 1971 ; Pratten and Lloyd , 1979 ) but not in others ( Piasek and Thyberg , 1980 ; Kyle et al . , 1988 ) . Cytochalasin also showed selective effects within the same cell . It inhibited uptake of ricin and Lucifer Yellow CH , while it had no effect on clathrin - dependent internalization of transferrin in A431 cells ( Sandvig and van Deurs , 1990 ) . It also completely blocked clathrin - dependent and independent endocytosis at the apical side of polarized MDCK cells but not at the basolateral surface ( Gottlieb et al . , 1993 ) . Are these results indicative of a selective requirement for actin in endocytosis or is it possible that the contribution of actin to mammalian endocytosis has been underestimated ? The cortical actin cytoskeleton can be stabilized by specialized proteins in different cell types and even in different regions of the same cell ( Luna , 1991 ) . Different actin depolymerizing drugs could therefore disrupt the cortical actin cytoskeleton to different extents depending on the cell type or the cell domain . Recent results from S . Schmid’s laboratory point to this direction . Latrunculin A , a drug that prevents actin polymerization ( Coué et al . , 1987 ) , but not cytochalasin D , completely blocked clathrin - dependent endocytosis ( Lamaze et al . , 1997 ) . Interestingly , latrunculin A , but not cytochalasin D , is efficient as an actin depolymerizating drug in yeast ( Ayscough and Drubin , 1996 ) . Ultrastructural and biochemical experiments suggesting a functional interaction between clathrin and the actin cytoskeleton have previously been reported in mammalian cells ( Salisbury et al . , 1980 ; Kohtz et al . , 1990 ) . Additionally , recent data demonstrate that clathrin associated proteins might be involved in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton . Strikingly , overexpression of dominant dynamin mutants in HeLa cells ( Damke et al . , 1994 ) or depletion of neuronal amphiphysin using antisense RNA ( Mundigl et al . , 1997 ) have a major effect on the structure of the cortical actin cytoskeleton . Additionally , calmodulin , which is essential for endocytosis and actin localization in yeast ( Kübler et al . , 1994 ; Ohya and Botstein , 1994 ) binds to clathrin light chains in animal cells ( Pley et al . , 1995 ) . In summary , the studies of endocytosis in animal and yeast cells are beginning to converge as the knowledge in both systems progresses . Even though , it is still early to decide exactly what is common and what is different , a few general guidelines can be drafted : the data indicate that clathrin - dependent and - independent endocytosis can take place in both cell types . An increasing number of proteins , with animal and yeast counterparts , seem to be involved in the process but it is not yet clear which machinery if at all is shared by clathrin - dependent and - independent pathways . Finally , the requirement of actin for the endocytic internalization which might have been underestimated in animal cells might turn out to be of key importance for the mechanism of formation of the endocytic vesicles . What is it in particular about the formation of endocytic vesicles that requires actin , whereas the formation of most vesicles at the ER or Golgi membranes does not ? Vesicle formation from internal membranes may occur at the rims of these structures , whereas endocytic internalization takes place from the mainly ﬂat or convex surface . Two additional forces may come into play here that work against vesicle formation , surface tension ( Dai and Sheetz , 1995 ) and osmotic pressure . We postulate that the force generated through actin polymerization and or actin - dependent molecular motors is used to deform the plasma membrane against these counterforces . M . I .
