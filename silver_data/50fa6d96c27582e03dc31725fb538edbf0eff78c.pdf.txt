It would be desirable to have independent control over biochemical and mechanical cues , to analyze their relative and combined effects on stem - cell function . We developed a synthetic , interfacial hydrogel culture system , termed variable moduli interpenetrating polymer networks ( vmIPNs ) , to assess the effects of soluble signals , adhesion ligand presentation , and material moduli from 10 – 10 , 000 Pa on adult neural stem - cell ( aNSC ) behavior . The aNSCs proliferated when cultured in serum - free growth media on peptide - modiﬁed vmIPNs with moduli of $ 100 Pa . In serum - free neuronal differentiation media , a peak level of the neuronal marker , b - tubulin III , was observed on vmIPNs of 500 Pa , near the physiological stiffness of brain tissue . Furthermore , under mixed differentiation conditions with serum , softer gels ( ; 100 – 500 Pa ) greatly favored neurons , whereas harder gels ( ; 1 , 000 – 10 , 000 Pa ) promoted glial cultures . In contrast , cell spreading , self - renewal , and differentiation were inhibited on substrata with moduli of ; 10 Pa . This work demonstrates that the mechanical and biochemical properties of an aNSC microenvironment can be tuned to regulate the self - renewal and differentiation of aNSCs . INTRODUCTION The mechanical properties of a cell’s environment affect a broad range of its properties , ranging from the morphology of embryonic cells and tissues ( 1 , 2 ) , to ﬁbroblast remodeling of collagen extracellular matrices ( ECMs ) ( 3 , 4 ) , to cell motility directed by substrate stiffness ( 5 , 6 ) . Recent work also indi - cated that peripheral nervous system cells ( 7 , 8 ) and PC12 adrenal tumor cells ( 9 , 10 ) show variable neurite extension and branching on mechanically tunable matrices and culture substrates . Substrate and matrix mechanical properties have been implicated in the behavior of tumor cell lines ( 11 ) and tumor progression ( 12 ) . Moreover , the differentiation of ep - ithelial cells ( 12 ) , myotubes ( 13 ) , and adult mesenchymal stem cells ( 14 , 15 ) toward particular lineages can be directed by substrate and matrix mechanical properties . These results indicate that cells in general and stem cells in particular are sensitive to the mechanical properties of a surrounding or underlying environment . The majority of cell types used in the aforementioned studies ( including ﬁbroblasts , mesenchymal cells , epithelial cells , and peripheral nervous system cells ) experience vari - able mechanical stimuli in vivo . Neural cells in the brain , in contrast , do not typically bear loads , and are mechanically isolated from the external environment by the cranium . Furthermore , native brain tissue is soft ( elastic moduli , E 9 (cid:2) 500 Pa ) ( 16 , 17 ) compared with muscle ( E 9 (cid:2) 10 4 Pa ) ( 13 , 18 ) , connective tissue ( E 9 (cid:2) 10 4 Pa ) ( 18 ) , skin ( E 9 (cid:2) 10 4 – 10 5 Pa ) ( 18 , 19 ) , and bone ( E 9 (cid:2) 10 9 – 10 10 Pa ) ( 18 , 19 ) . It is therefore unclear whether the mechanosensitive behavior observed in cells derived from stiffer tissues that are exposed to variable mechanical loads will be present in neural stem cells from the adult brain . Recent work showed that primary neural cells from the brain , such as postnatal day 0 ( PO ) mouse hippocampal neurons ( 20 ) and mixed embryonic stage 17 – 19 ( E1 – E19 ) rat embryonic cortical progenitors ( 21 ) , exhibit variable neuro - nal morphological differentiation and glial survival , respec - tively , on substrates of variable stiffness . Although these important studies shed light on neurogenesis in the embry - onic and early postnatal brain , the extent to which substrate stiffness inﬂuences the fate decisions of a homogeneous neural stem cell population has not been explored . We ana - lyzed the effects of substrate stiffness on the behavior of adult neural stem cells , a recently discovered cell population from the adult brain ( 22 , 23 ) . Adult neural stem cells ( aNSCs ) have the capacity to differentiate into the three major cell types of the adult nervous system ( 24 ) , are involved in new memory formation ( 22 , 25 ) , respond to neural injury ( 22 ) , and repre - sent an important potential resource for a wide range of biomedical and neuroregenerative applications ( 26 , 27 ) . In addition , aNSCs may encounter different mechanical envi - ronments in the adult brain ( including gray and white matter , blood vessels , layered cell structures , and glial scars ) which may present variable moduli ( E 9 (cid:2) 10 2 – 10 3 Pa ) ( 17 , 28 ) . Glial scarring in particular occurs after acute insults to the central doi : 10 . 1529 / biophysj . 108 . 132217 Submitted February 23 , 2008 , and accepted for publication July 17 , 2008 .

Furthermore , the range of stiffness over which primary neuronal cultures were studied ( 20 , 21 ) was not previously extended below physiological stiffness ( , 250 Pa ) , and the extracellular matrix proteins used ( gen - erally laminin or ﬁbronectin ) present a number of receptor binding motifs that bind numerous adhesion receptors . Therefore , we studied the behavior and cell fate commitment of aNSCs in terms of mechanical signals on a biochemically well - deﬁned substrate . Our work builds upon a synthetic materials platform , termed an interpenetrating polymer network ( IPN ) ( 29 – 32 ) . The IPN synthesis was modiﬁed such that substrate me - chanical properties could be quantitatively modulated over a wide range , including stiffness above and below the regime relevant to neural tissue ( E 9 (cid:2) 10 2 – 10 3 Pa ) ( 16 , 17 ) . The proliferation or self - renewal , and multipotent differentiation , of aNSCs were analyzed in these variable moduli IPNs ( vmIPNs ) . Results implicated a critical range of mechanical properties that modulate and support cell self - renewal , and bias cells toward neuronal versus glial differentiation . Intriguingly , optimal aNSC neuronal differentiation was observed near the mechanical properties of native brain tissue . MATERIALS AND METHODS Materials for vmIPN synthesis Acrylamide ( AAm ) , poly ( ethylene glycol ) 1000 monomethyl ether mono - methacrylate ( pEGMA ) , acrylic acid ( AAc ) , acetic acid , N , N 9 - methylenebis ( acrylamide ) ( BIS ; ultrapure grade ) , and N , N , N 9 , N 9 - tetramethylethylenedi - amine ( TEMED ) were purchased from Polysciences , Inc . ( Warrington , PA ) . We acquired N - hydroxysulfosuccinimide ( sulfo - NHS ) , 2 - ( N - morpholino ) ethanesulfonic acid , 0 . 9 % sodium chloride buffer ( MES ; BupH MES Buff - ered Saline Pack ) , and sulfosuccinimidyl 4 - ( N - maleimidomethyl ) cyclo - hexane - 1 - carboxylate ( sulfo - SMCC ) from Pierce ( Rockford , IL ) . We obtained QTX ( [ 3 - ( 3 , 4 - dimethyl - 9 - oxo - 9H - thioxanthen - 2 - yloxy ) - 2 - hydroxypropyl ] tri - methylammoniumchloride ) , ammoniumpersulfate , anddichlorodimethylsilane from Sigma - Aldrich ( St . Louis , MO ) . Methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane ( MTMS ) andallyltrichlorosilane ( ATC ) wereobtainedfromGelest ( Morrisville , PA ) . Diamino - poly ( ethylene glycol ) ( PEG ( NH 2 ) 2 ; 3400 g / mol , chromato - graphically pure ) was purchasedfromNektar ( Huntsville , AL ) . Thearginine - glycine - aspartic acid ( RGD ) and arginine - glycine - glutamic acid ( RGE ) peptides were synthesized by American Peptide Co . ( Sunnyvale , CA ) , and characterized using mass spectrometry and high - performance liquid chro - matography ( purities . 95 % ) . TheRGDandRGE peptides werebasedonthe integrin - binding sequence from rat - bone sialoprotein : acetyl - CGGNGEP - RGDTYRAY - NH 2 [ bsp - RGD ( 15 ) ] and acetyl - CGGNGEPRGETYRAY - NH 2 [ bsp - RGE ( 15 ) ] peptide , and acetyl - CGGNGEP RGE TYRAY - NH 2 . All other chemicals were reagent - grade , and were used as purchased without further puriﬁcation . All glassware was cleaned with a 2 % solution of Contrad 70 ( catalog number 04 - 355 , Decon Laboratories , King of Prussia , PA ) in water for 2 h , rinsed copiously with water , and baked dry . All water used in this study was ultrapure American Society for Testing and Materials ( ASTM ) type I reagent - grade water ( 18 . 2 M V - cm , pyrogen - free , endotoxin , 0 . 03 EU / m ) ( 33 ) . Cell culture surface preparation Laminin cell culture surfaces were coated with poly - ornithine and satu - rated with mouse laminin I from the Engelbreth - Holm - Swarm sarcoma ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) , as described previously ( 34 ) . For vmIPN synthesis , all reactions were carried out at room temperature unless oth - erwise stated . Glass coverslips ( 18 - mm diameter , Fisher Scientiﬁc , Santa Clara , CA ) were cleaned by submersion in ultrapure water ( UPW ) and sonicated for 30 min in UPW ( Bransonic 5510 , 40 kHz , 469 W , and 117 V , Branson Ultrasonic , Danbury , CT ) . This sonication step was repeated with acetone and again with UPW . After cleaning , samples were dried ( N 2 ) and cleaned with an O 2 plasma ( March Plasmod , Concord , CA ) at 1 torr and 125 W for 5 min , to remove any adsorbed surface species . As described below , vmIPN was then grafted to the glass coverslip , using a two - step sequential photopolymerization developed from previously published protocols ( 29 , 30 ) . To activate glass substrates for synthesis , glass coverslips were treated with an organosilane to functionalize the surface for polymerization . Sam - ples were covered in a 1 % ( v / v ) methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane , 94 % ( v / v ) methanol ( MeOH ) , and 5 % ( v / v ) water solution containing 5 m L of acetic acid . Samples were then rinsed 3 times in MeOH and baked for 30 min at 110 (cid:3) C . This activation method was compared with previously published glutaraldehyde activation methods ( 15 ) . For the ﬁrst polymerization step of vmIPN synthesis , AAm gels were polymerized directly onto the functionalized glass coverslips . Solutions of 3 – 5 % ( w / v ) AAm and varying amounts of BIS ( 0 . 3 – 0 . 03 % , w / v ) were produced in water . Polymerization was initiated by adding 10 – 20 m L of TEMED and 100 m L of 10 % ( w / v ) ammonium persulfate ( AP ) per 10 mL of reactant solution . We pipetted 60 m L of this solution immediately onto the coverslipsand covered it with glass ‘‘coverdisks’’ placed facedown ontop of the monomer / cross - linker solution to create a smooth surface for cell culture . Theseglasscoverdisksconsistedof18 - mm - diametercoverslips , weretreated with dichlorodimethylsilane for 1 min , and were wiped clean with Kimwipes ( Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO ) before use . Samples were allowed to po - lymerize for ; 10 – 30 min . Then the coverdisks were removed , and samples were stored in water overnight . An IPN was created by polymerizing a second layer of poly ( ethylene glycol ) ( pEG ) ( ; 4 nm thick ) within the top few nanometers of the ﬁrst AAm layer . A solutionof0 . 02g / mL poly ( ethylene glycol ) - 1000 - monomethylether ( pEGMA ) , 0 . 0162 mL / mL AAc , and 0 . 01 g / mL BIS was initiated with 0 . 005 g / mL QTX in a degassed solution of 97 : 3 ( v / v ) water / isopropanol ( IPA , Fisher Scientiﬁc ) for 1 h , using an ultraviolet light transilluminator table ( model TFL - 40 , Ultra - Violet Products , Upland , CA ) . The power of the table was measured at 2 . 3 mW / cm 2 , using a radiometer ( International Light , Peabody , MA ) with a 352 – 377 - nm bandpass ﬁlter . This resulted in an IPN with a high density of pEG at the surface ( 35 ) . Details regarding peptide grafting to the IPN can be found elsewhere ( 29 , 30 ) , and are described brieﬂy below . After formation of the IPN , samples were equilibrated with buffer ( . 30 min , MES , 0 . 5 M , pH 7 ) . To functionalize the IPN with biological ligands , 3400 M w PEG ( NH 2 ) 2 spacer chains were grafted to the AAc sites via a carbodiimide reaction ( 1 h , 0 . 5 M MES , pH 7 , 0 . 150 g / mL PEG ( NH 2 ) 2 , 0 . 005 g / mL EDC , 0 . 0025 g / mL Sulfo - NHS ) . After thereaction , thesolutionwasaspirated , andsampleswererinsedtwicewith0 . 1 M MES buffer ( pH 7 . 0 ) , followed by two rinses with 50 mM sodium borate buffer ( pH 7 . 5 ) . At this point , the samples were sterilized by ultraviolet irra - diation in a biosafety hood for 30 min . All subsequent solutions were sterile - ﬁltered through a 0 . 22 - m m ﬁlter . To couple bioactive molecules to the PEG ( NH 2 ) 2 - modiﬁed IPN , the heterobifunctional cross - linker , sulfo - SMCC , wasreactedwith the freeamineon thePEG ( NH 2 ) 2 chains ( 0 . 0005 g / mLsulfo - SMCC , pH 7 . 5 , borate buffer , 30 min ) . The solution was then aspirated , and samples were rinsed twice with borate buffer , followed by two rinses with peptide - coupling buffer ( sodium phosphate , 0 . 1 M , pH 6 . 6 ) . Finally , the pep - tide ( bsp - RGD ( 15 ) or bsp - RGE ( 15 ) ) was coupled ( 20 m M ) to the maleimide ( sulfo - SMCC ) atthepeptideN - terminalfreethiol . Aftertheovernightreaction , the solution was aspirated , and samples were rinsed 4 – 5 times with coupling buffer , sonicated ( UPW , 5 min ) , rinsed ( UPW ) , and stored in phosphate - Modulus Directs Neural Stem Cell Behavior 4427 Biophysical Journal 95 ( 9 ) 4426 – 4438 buffered saline with 5000 U - m g / mL PennStrep ( 5000 U penicillin and 5000 m g streptomycin per milliliter ) at 4 (cid:3) C . Rheological materials characterization During the AAm polymerization step of IPN synthesis , 5 mL of reactant so - lutions of AAm , BIS , TEMED , and AP were poured into a 60 - mm - diameter polystyrene dish . The resulting bulk gels ( ; 1 mm thick ) were swollen in water overnight and then trimmed and loaded into a rheometer . Oscillatory shear measurements of polyacrylamide ( pAAm ) gels were performed on a rheometer ( MCR300 , Anton Paar , Ashland , VA ) with 50 - mm parallel plates at a gap height of 0 . 5 – 3 . 0 mm . A humidity chamber was placed around the sample to prevent dehydration . The lower plate temperature was regulated with a Peltier heating element connected to a recirculating water bath . Fre - quency sweeps from 0 . 001 – 10 Hz at 5 % strain were performed ﬁrst at 25 (cid:3) C , and then at 37 (cid:3) C . No signiﬁcant difference in complex modulus was seen between the two temperatures . The elastic modulus , E 9 , was estimated as E 9 ¼ 2 G 9 ( 1 1 v ) , where G 9 isthe complex storagemodulusat 1Hzas measured by the rheometer and v is Poisson’s ratio , assumed to be 0 . 5 . Results from atomic - force measurements on vmIPNs and rheological measurements on the bulk polyacrylamide gels showed good agreement ( 35 ) . Furthermore , the modulus of the polyacrylamide layer and the full vmIPN were not statisti - cally different ( 35 ) . In addition , we assumed that the E 9 for tissue - culture polystyrene was ; 10 9 Pa , as measured previously ( 36 ) . Neural stem - cell culture Neural stem cells were isolated from the hippocampi of adult female Fischer 344ratsaspreviouslydescribed ( 24 ) , andwereusedbetween10 – 30passages of culturing . Cells were seeded ( 1500 cells / cm 2 for proliferation ; 25 , 000 cells / cm 2 for differentiation ) onto peptide - modiﬁed vmIPNs or laminin - modiﬁed culture wells , and incubated ( 37 (cid:3) C , 5 % CO 2 ) in serum - free media consisting of Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle medium ( F - 12 / DMEM , high glu - cose , with L - glutamine , with pyridoxine hydrochloride , and without sodium pyruvate ; Invitrogen ) with N - 2 supplement ( Invitrogen ) . These media were supplemented with various soluble factors to modulate cell behavior : 20 ng / mL FGF - 2 ( Invitrogen ) for cell proliferation , 1 m M retinoic acid ( BioMol , Plymouth Meeting , PA ) with 5 m M forskolin ( BioMol ) for neuronal differ - entiation , or 1 m M retinoic acid with 1 v / v % fetal bovine serum ( Invitrogen ) for mixed glial and neuronal differentiation . Wells were rinsed every 48 h with fresh media . The self - renewal and differentiation of these exact cells on IPNs grafted to polystyrene were described previously ( 29 ) and compared with laminin - coated polystyrene . Immunoﬂuorescence assays For immunoﬂuorescence staining , cells were cultured for 5 – 6 days and ﬁxed with 4 % paraformaldehyde ( Fisher Scientiﬁc ) , blocked for 1 h with 2 % goat serum ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , permeabilized with 0 . 3 % Triton X - 100 ( Calbio - chem , San Diego , CA ) , and incubated for 36 h with primary antibodiesrabbit anti - nestin ( 1 : 500 dilution ; AbCam , Cambridge , MA ) , mouse anti - b - tubulin III ( 1 : 500 dilution ; Sigma - Aldrich ) , and guinea pig anti - glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein ( GFAP ; 1 : 1000 dilution ; Advanced Immunochemical , Long Beach , CA ) . The primary antibody solution was then removed , and cells were rinsed andincubatedfor1 . 5hwithAlexaFluorsecondaryantibodies : 488goatanti - rabbit immunoglobulin G , 546 goat anti - mouse immunoglobulin G , and 647 goat anti - guinea pig immunoglobulin G at a dilution of 1 : 500 ( all from In - vitrogen ) . Nuclei were stained with DAPI ( Invitrogen ) . Images were col - lected on a Nikon Eclipse TE2000 - E and a Zeiss META 510 laser scanning confocal microscope . Quantitative real - time polymerase chain reaction assay Quantitative real - time polymerase chain reaction ( QRT - PCR ) was used as a complementary technique to immunoﬂuorescent staining , for accurate quantiﬁcation of speciﬁc mRNA concentrations in cells grown on vmIPNs and laminin ( using an iCycler 4 , Bio - Rad Laboratories , Hercules , CA ) ( 37 ) . Cells were lysed and frozen in TRIZOL ( Invitrogen ) , and mRNA was ex - tracted and reverse - transcribed to cDNA using the ThermoScript RT - PCR System for First - Strand cDNA Synthesis ( Invitrogen ) . The QRT - PCR assay used GFAP as a marker for astrocytic differentiation of progenitor cells , b - tubulin III as a marker for neurons , and nestin as a marker for aNSCs . Equivalent amounts of total RNA were transcribed into cDNA , which were subsequently used as templates for each QRT - PCR reaction . To normalize any remaining variations in starting cDNA amounts , each reaction was carried out in duplex format , with ribosomal 18S detected using Cal - Dye TaqMan probes ( Biosearch Technologies , Novato , CA ) . The lineage marker was detected using FAM - Dye TaqMan probes ( Biosearch Technologies ) . Duplicate QRT - PCR reactions were run for each biological sample , where n ¼ 5 – 6 for each condition . The primers and TaqMan probes included : GFAP , 5 9 - GACCTGCGA - CCTTGAGTCCT - 3 9 , 5 9 - TCTCCTCCTTGAGGCTTTGG - 3 9 , 5 9 - FAM490 - TCCTTGGAGAGGCAAATGCGC - BHQ - 3 9 ; b - tubulin III , 5 9 - GCATG - GATGAGATGGAGTTCACC - 3 9 , 5 9 - CGACTCCTCGTCGTCATCTTCA - TAC - 3 9 , 5 9 - FAM490 - TGAACGACCTGGTGTCTGAG - BHQ - 3 9 ; nestin , 5 9 - GAGCTCTCTGGGCAAGTGGA - 3 9 , 5 9 - CTCCCACCGCTGTTGAT - TTC - 3 9 , 5 9 - FAM490 - AGGACAGTCAGCAGTGCCTGCA - BHQ - 3 9 ; and18S , 5 9 - GTAACCCGTTGAACCCCATTC - 3 9 , 5 9 - CCATCCAATCGGTAGTA - GCGA - 3 9 , 5 9 - CAL610 - AAGTGCGGGTCATAAGCTTGCG - BHQ - 3 9 . Stan - dards for performing QRT - PCR were pPCR4 - TOPO plasmids ( Invitrogen ) , containing the amplicon of interest as an insert . The plasmids were linearized by restriction digest and quantiﬁed by absorbance , and 10 - fold serial dilutions from 1 ng / m L to 10 (cid:3) 9 ng / m L were prepared to generate a standard curve . Image analysis To assay self - renewal , aNSCs were seeded at 1500 cells / cm 2 on various surfaces and grown for 3 – 6 days , and phase - contrast images were taken every 12 – 24 h of culture . Cell number was determined by image analysis of phase contrast and bright - ﬁeld images of cells . Image analysis used ImageJ or CellProﬁler software ( 38 ) . The image - analysis method was validated by using the CyQUANT assay ( Invitrogen ) , following the manufacturer’s in - structions ( data not shown ) . Each cell in the differentiation immunostaining experiments was scored manually as positive for neuronal or glial markers with n ¼ 3 biological replicate wells per condition . In the neuronal differentiation experiment , b - tubulin III intensity histograms were generated in CellProﬁler software ( 38 ) . Primary objects / cells were identiﬁed by DAPI staining , and the average intensity of pixels within a circle with a set radius around the primary object was measured . Three biological replicate wells ( n ¼ 3 ) were used per con - dition . Samples without primary antibody added but with only secondary antibody were used as negative controls to measure background ﬂuores - cence . All images , including negative controls , were processed , and the negative - control levels were then subtracted from all images . The b - tubulin III staining of cells cultured in 1 m M retinoic acid and 5 m M forskolin on laminin - coated polystyrene was used to produce positive controls ( 24 ) . Cells on gels with similar intensities were scored b - tubulin III - positive . Likewise , GFAP staining of cells cultured in 1 v / v % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) on laminin / polystyrene was used to produce positive controls ( 24 ) . Relative numbers of marker - positive cells are shown in Fig . 5 . RESULTS Synthesis of vmIPNs A primary objective and central need of this work was to create materials with variable moduli and deﬁned and ad - justable surface chemistry ( Fig . 1 A ) . We modiﬁed the syn - thesis of well - studied IPNs to control the modulus within a range of 10 – 10 , 000 Pa , while allowing peptide modiﬁcation 4428 Saha et al . Biophysical Journal 95 ( 9 ) 4426 – 4438 of the interface to modulate cell adhesion . Table 1 lists the conditions used for the ﬁrst polymerization in the synthesis scheme that deﬁned the mechanical properties of our vmIPNs . Free - radical polymerization occurred in the reactant solution well above the underlying glass support , and created a network ; 70 m m thick ( characterized by Irwin et al . ( 35 ) ) . The poly ( acrylamide ) ( pAAm ) networks created in situ via free - radical polymerization exhibited a high degree of swelling when immersed in aqueous solvents . Both swelling and rheological measurements were made on bulk pAAm gels of ; 60 - mm diameter and 1 - mm thickness , which were polymerized in parallel during vmIPN AAm layer polymer - ization ( Fig . 1 and Table 1 ) . The swelling of pAAm gels in water increased as the weight % of BIS cross - linker de - creased in the reactant mixture ( Fig . 1 B ) . When pAAm network formulations that exhibited a high swelling ratio were formed on top of both methacryl and glutaraldehyde activated glass , surface defects appeared after immersing in aqueous media overnight ( Fig . 1 B ) . No difference in both the presence and spatial pattern of surface defects was seen be - tween the methacryl - mediated and glutaraldehyde - mediated surface chemistries ( data not shown ) . To overcome this problem , formulations in Table 1 were optimized to have a low swelling ratio ( i . e . , a high weight % BIS ) , while modu - lating the weight % AAm to tune the moduli to a desired value . Note that in the ; 10 - Pa formulation , the swelling ratio is high , because all other reactant formulations attempted for this extremely soft gel failed to polymerize reliably in am - bient conditions . Because of the high swelling ratio , surface defects were seen on some portions of the ; 10 - Pa vmIPN formulation listed in Table 1 . However , all subsequent con - clusions about cell behavior could be drawn by observation FIGURE 1 Synthesis of a vmIPN and characterization .

Molecular weights of the CH 2 CH 2 O repeat for m and n are 1000 and 3400 , respectively . ( B ) Swell - ing behavior of ﬁrst poly ( acrylamide ) ( pAAm ) layer in water . Swelling ratio ( S . R . ) is calculated as in Table 1 . After swelling in water , surface features ap - peared in the ﬁrst vmIPN pAAm layer of low moduli ( e . g . , , 1000 Pa for 10 wt % gels ) which have high swelling ratios . The pAAm layers shown at S . R . ; 1 . 8 were 13 . 5 6 1 Pa . After 10 min in a 50 / 50 v / v water : isopropyl alcohol ( IPA ) solution , surface morphology was altered in the ﬁrst vmIPN pAAm layer of low moduli ( e . g , , 1000 Pa for 10 weight % gels ) which have high swelling ratios . After the second polymerization of the vmIPN , surface features persisted in 50 : 50 v / v isopropyl alcohol ( IPA ) / water solvent conditions , but were absent in 3 : 97 v / v IPA / water solvent conditions . ( C ) The aNSC response was speciﬁc to peptide ligand on vmIPNs . The aNSCs adhere and proliferate on bsp - RGD ( 15 ) peptide - modiﬁed vmIPNs , whereas they form nonadherent cell aggregates on bsp - RGE ( 15 ) peptide - modiﬁed vmIPNs . Both substrates have an elastic modulus of 97 . 8 6 8 Pa ( Table 1 ) . These phase - contrast images were taken after 3 days of culture in FGF - 2 proliferating media conditions . Modulus Directs Neural Stem Cell Behavior 4429 Biophysical Journal 95 ( 9 ) 4426 – 4438 of aNSC behavior on areas of ; 10 - Pa vmIPN samples that were ﬂat without surface defects , and any exceptions are speciﬁcally noted . After optimizing the ﬁrst polymerization in the vmIPN synthesis scheme ( Table 1 ) , a second poly ( ethylene - glycol ) and acrylic - acid polymerization was conducted in a novel solvent system . For soft ( , 1000 Pa ) pAAm networks on glass , simple immersion of the pAAm network in a 50 : 50 v / v % isopropyl alcohol / water solution , the solvent previously used for the second polymerization ( 29 , 30 ) , induced formation of surface defects ( Fig . 1 B ) . Subsequent polymerization of the second , interpenetrating p ( EG - co - AAc ) layer under these poor solvent conditions effectively ‘‘locked’’ these surface features in the pAAm network into place ( Fig . 1 B ) . We reduced the 50 : 50 v / v % isopropyl alcohol / water solvent from previous protocols to a 3 : 97 v / v % ratio , which eliminated these surface features ( Fig . 1 B ) . Subsequent peptide - grafting to the vmIPN followed previously published protocols ( 29 , 30 ) . Surface chemical composition , as monitored by C 1 - s , N 1 - s , O 1 - s , and Si 1 - s peaks by x - ray photoelectron spectroscopy and ﬂuorescent peptide surface density , did not vary with modulus in surfaces prepared using these methods ( 35 ) . These vmIPNs deﬁned a thick , ﬂat substrate with a tunable , well - character - ized chemistry for our subsequent studies with aNSCs . aNSC self - renewal on vmIPNs The aNSCs isolated from adult rat hippocampi ( 34 ) were ﬁrst cultured on vmIPNs under media conditions that promoted proliferation ( 24 ) ( Figs . 1 C and 2 ) . Importantly , aNSCs re - sponded speciﬁcally to the grafted ligand for all formulations in Table 1 , because no aNSCs attached to RGE - modiﬁed vmIPNs , and they instead formed nonadherent spheres ( data not shown ; Fig . 1 C ) . In other words , aNSCs attached ef - fectively to all RGD - modiﬁed vmIPNs ( data not shown ) , and spread well on vmIPNs of moduli greater than ; 100 Pa soon after seeding ( data not shown ) . In addition , no difference in cell morphology was seen during proliferation on vmIPNs of $ 100 Pa versus laminin coated polystyrene ( data not shown ; Fig . 2 A ) . By contrast , on ; 10 - Pa vmIPNs , aNSCs did not disperse well , and grew in adherent clusters during the entire course of the experiment ( data not shown ; Fig . 2 A ) . Lineage markers were analyzed by immunoﬂuorescence to assess cell - differentiation state . After 5 days of culture in proliferating media conditions , cells were ﬁxed and stained to analyze protein markers for three lineages : immature stem cells , mature astrocytes , and mature neurons . All cells ex - pressed high levels of the progenitor cell marker protein nestin , and low levels of the astrocytic and neuronal marker proteins , GFAP and b - tubulin III , respectively ( Fig . 2 B ) . Therefore , under proliferating media conditions , all vmIPN substrates maintained the immature cell properties of the harvested nestin 1 aNSC population . To quantify cell - proliferation rate , cell number was deter - mined by analysis of phase - contrast images taken every 12 – 24 h during culture for 5 days , and was ﬁt to a Verhulst logistic growth model ( Fig . 2 C ) . The Verhulst model assumes ex - ponential growth with contact inhibition , and contains only three parameters : effective growth rate , maximal substrate carrying capacity , and initial cell number . Both the carrying capacity and initial cell number were determined experi - mentally , by counting cells in an aNSC conﬂuent layer and counting cells 2 h after seeding for each sample , respectively . The vmIPNs of moduli $ 100 Pa supported robust prolifer - ation , as indicated by only modest changes of effective growth rate , r , with time in this range ( Fig . 2 C ) . However , aNSCs divided much more slowly , and in clusters , on ; 10 - Pa IPNs ( Fig . 2 ) . Interestingly , a slight peak in cell prolifer - ation was observed between 1 – 4 kPa , near the stiffness of native brain tissue ( 17 , 28 ) . aNSC differentiation on vmIPNs In addition to self - renewal , aNSCs can exhibit multipotent differentiation into glial and neuronal lineages in vivo ( 39 ) and in vitro on laminin coated polystyrene dishes ( 24 ) . To determine the ability of vmIPNs to support multipotent dif - ferentiation , we seeded aNSCs in media containing 1 v / v % FBS , a condition shown to drive astrocytic differentiation on hard surfaces ( 24 , 40 ) . Control conditions included aNSCs on laminin - coated polystyrene either in 1 v / v % FBS or in the presence of 1 m M retinoic acid and 5 m M forskolin , which strongly promote neuronal differentiation . The aNSCs at - tached to and spread well on all RGD - modiﬁed vmIPNs of moduli greater than or equal to ; 100 Pa soon after seeding ( Figs . 3 A and 4 A and C ) , though aNSCs on ; 10 - Pa IPNs did not spread as well , and clustered during differentiation ( Fig . 3 , B and C ) . Quantitatively , equal numbers of aNSCs attached initially to all surfaces ( Figs . 3 A and 4 A – C ) . Cell number then reached a brief plateau at day 1 , likely representing cell - cycle TABLE 1 Tuning the vmIPN moduli to those of neural tissue Weight % AAm Weight % BIS Swelling ratio Measured elastic modulus ( Pa ) of swollen pAAm network ( 6 SD ) ( n ¼ 3 ) 10 . 0 0 . 300 1 . 11 9580 6 767 10 . 0 0 . 150 1 . 18 5460 6 290 5 . 00 0 . 200 1 . 10 902 6 71 4 . 00 0 . 200 1 . 15 431 6 26 3 . 00 0 . 100 1 . 25 97 . 8 6 8 3 . 00 0 . 025 1 . 80 13 . 5 6 1 By manipulating the concentration of monomers acrylamide ( AAm ) and bisacrylamide ( BIS ) , poly ( acrylamide ) ( pAAm ) gels were synthesized to range in modulus from ; 10 to 10 , 000 Pa . These formulations were chosen to minimize the swelling ratio of these gels ( Fig . 1 B ) . Polymerizations were conducted in 10 - mL batches . The 10 weight % AAm formulations utilized 20 m L TEMED and 100 m L of 10 weight % AP , whereas all other for - mulations used 6 m L TEMED and 50 m L AP . Swelling ratio was calculated as the ratio of the diameter of the AAm network after . 12 h of swelling in ultrapure water versus the diameter of the initial in situ polymerized diameter . Elastic modulus was determined through rheology ( see Materials and Methods ) . 4430 Saha et al . Biophysical Journal 95 ( 9 ) 4426 – 4438 arrest , and modestly decreased through day 6 . This gradual reduction in cell number on laminin - polystyrene surfaces with serum or forskolin / retinoic acid likely indicates that a fraction of cells was unable to undergo full differentiation into astrocytes or neurons , respectively , indicating a modest cell selection during the differentiation process . On the vmIPN surfaces , ﬁnal cell number gradually decreased with decreasing stiffness , indicating that cells did not survive or proliferate as effectively on softer surfaces under conditions that promote astrocytic differentiation ( Fig . 4 C ) . The extent of glial differentiation at 6 days was quantita - tively analyzed on different moduli ( Fig . 4 B ) , and GFAP staining intensity was divided into high and low bins ( Fig . 4 D ) . This analysis indicates that the extent of maturation of astrocytic ( GFAP 1 ) cells is constant over moduli , because no statistically signiﬁcant differences in GFAP staining were observed with modulus ( Figs . 3 C and 4 D ) . We also analyzed cell differentiation as a function of modulus under strong proneuronal media conditions ( 1 m M retinoic acid and 5 m M forskolin ) , shown to bias differenti - ation heavily toward neurons on laminin and stiff IPN sub - strates ( 29 , 40 ) . The aNSCs again attached effectively to all RGD - modiﬁed vmIPNs in this neuronal differentiation me - dia ( data not shown ) , and spread well on IPNs of moduli greater than ; 100 Pa soon after seeding ( data not shown ) . However , on ; 10 - Pa IPNs , NSCs differentiated in clusters ( Fig . 5 A ) . We analyzed the quality of neuronal differentia - tion after 6 days by measuring both b - tubulin III protein and gene expression levels via quantitative immunoﬂuorescence analysis and QRT - PCR , respectively ( Fig . 5 , B and C ) .

Modulus Directs Neural Stem Cell Behavior 4431 Biophysical Journal 95 ( 9 ) 4426 – 4438 cause the cultures were composed solely of neurons , both of these methods provided information on the average b - tubulin III expression per cell . Quantitative real - time PCR revealed an optimum in neuronal differentiation on ; 500 - Pa vmIPNs , as indicated by the peak in b - tubulin III expression in Fig . 5 C ( left axis ) , whereas expression of GFAP , an astrocytic marker , remained low across all moduli ( data not shown ) . Immunoﬂuorescence staining to analyze marker expression at the single - cell level indicated that nearly all cells were positive for b - tubulin III across all substrates , but cells from each sample exhibited a range of b - tubulin III intensities . Intensity histograms for each image were analyzed , and the number of cells with high b - tubulin III staining intensity ( Fig . 5 C , right axis ) correlated well with QRT - PCR ex - pression results . These results show that below physiological stiffness , neuronal mRNA and protein expression decreases . Finally , we analyzed whether , under conditions where cells ordinarily differentiate into a mixture of neurons and astro - cytes ( 1 m M retinoic acid 1 1 v / v % serum ) , substrate stiffness could bias the lineage of the differentiated cell population . When retinoic acid was added to serum - containing media , the softest substrates showed a greater percentage of cells positive for the neuronal marker b - tubulin III , and a lower percentage of glial GFAP - positive cells ( Fig . 6 B ) . Strikingly , as the substrates became stiffer , more glia and fewer neurons were observed . Both the increase in glia and decrease in neurons with stiffer substrates appeared to be monotonic , with ap - proximately equal numbers of glia and neurons produced from FIGURE 3 The aNSCs differentiate on vmIPNs into glia over a wide range of moduli .

It should also be noted that all vmIPNs exhibited at least a 15 % greater percentage of neurons than the control laminin - coated polystyrene surface ( Fig . 6 ) . These results indicate that vmIPNs ; 100 Pa and stiffer can support both neuronal and glial differentiation , but interestingly , softer gels either instruct neuronal lineage commitment , or select for neuronal over glial cell survival . DISCUSSION We examined the self - renewal and differentiation of aNSCs in well - deﬁned biochemical and mechanical microenviron - ments . By developing a synthetic cell culture platform , we were able to vary the range of mechanical properties of the substrate by three orders of magnitude , spanning a range of elastic moduli above and below that of native brain tissue . The aNSC self - renewal was well - supported on vmIPNs of ; 100 – 10 , 000 Pa . Under conditions that induce neuronal differentiation , differentiation peaked on vmIPNs of ; 500 Pa , the approximate modulus of the hippocampus ( 17 ) . Cells differentiating into astrocytes did not survive well on softer surfaces , though the extent of astrocytic differentiation did not vary with modulus . Finally , under conditions that in - duced mixed differentiation , the fraction of glial cells FIGURE 5 The aNSCs differentiate on vmIPNs into neurons at ; 500 Pa .

Biophysical Journal 95 ( 9 ) 4426 – 4438 monotonically decreased and neurons increased in mixed differentiation conditions as vmIPNs became progressively softer . Therefore , modulus and soluble factors can be com - bined to control the composition and extent of differentiation of neural stem - cell cultures . In general , the vmIPN represents a versatile platform to tune independently both the biochemical and mechanical properties of a culture substrate ( Fig . 1 A ) . Both soluble and substrate biochemical signals , which are important regulators of stem - cell behavior ( 29 , 41 , 42 ) , can function via ligand - re - ceptor engagement at the substrate - cell interface . However , it is preferable to employ well - deﬁned signals to control this interface , because serum and animal - derived or human - de - rived ECM proteins , for example , can obfuscate efforts to study substrate - mediated signaling . Serum proteins can adsorb to surfaces in a manner that is difﬁcult to control , and ECM proteins have variable isoforms , splice forms , and glyco - forms of unknown signaling properties . Our vmIPN was engineered to avoid these issues and promote speciﬁc ligand - receptor engagement between the bsp - RGD ( 15 ) and the a v b 3 integrin ( 29 ) . Furthermore , the substrate ligand motif can readily be varied in this system , enabling analysis of the capacities of different cell - surface receptors in mechano - transduction .

Modulus Directs Neural Stem Cell Behavior 4435 Biophysical Journal 95 ( 9 ) 4426 – 4438 strates with variable moduli typically used AAm polymeri - zation on an activated glass substrate ( 15 , 20 , 43 ) . The re - sulting immobilized pAAm network can swell substantially to create surface defects ( Fig . 1 B ) , particularly at low moduli . These features represent obstacles to using low - moduli pAAm substrates , e . g . , aNSCs preferentially migrate into and are retained within the surface defects of culture substrates that are swollen in aqueous media conditions ( data not shown ) . In this study , the monomer weight % was optimized to minimize swelling . Furthermore , IPN chemistry synthesis and sterilization conditions were modiﬁed from earlier pro - tocols ( 29 , 30 ) to avoid changes in the surface morphology attributable to the swelling of polymer networks . The se - quential chemistry of the vmIPN allows facile conjugation of many ligands over a large range of surface densities , a feature previously demonstrated with traditional IPNs ( 29 , 30 ) . Moreover , vmIPNs offer the capacity to create ligand arrays , using techniques that were successful on glass substrates for embryonic cortical progenitors ( 41 ) . The vmIPN platform was recently used with activated monocytes ( 35 ) , and can readily be extended to other cell types . The behavior of aNSCs differed markedly between ex - tremely soft culture substrates ( E 9 ; 10 Pa ) versus all other substrates of higher moduli ( Figs . 2 – 6 ) . The aNSCs attached to ; 10 - Pa substrates , but remained highly rounded and clustered ( Fig . 2 A ) . Hippocampal glial cells and tissue have elastic moduli of ; 100 and 300 Pa , respectively ( 17 ) , well above the 10 - Pa substrate , signifying that appropriate aNSC adhesion does not occur below the stiffness of the native microenvironment . These results also suggest that cytoskeletal compressive and tensile elements do not mature on ; 10 - Pa vmIPNs under both proliferating and differentiation condi - tions . Interestingly , cells on surfaces above this threshold experience an optimum in proliferation rate as a function of modulus ( Fig . 2 C ) . On laminin - coated polystyrene substrates , phosphoinositide 3 - OH kinase ( PI3K ) / Akt - mediated FGF - 2 stimulated aNSC self - renewal ( 44 ) , and this pathway may in - tersect with mechanotransducive pathways that are activated on RGD - modiﬁed vmIPNs of $ 100 Pa . Interestingly , the me - chanical stretch of 3T3 ﬁbroblast cells increased the activation of an important RGD receptor , a v b 3 integrin , and was medi - ated by PI3K / Akt ( 45 ) . How PI3K / Akt , integrins , and moduli combine to regulate aNSC self - renewal merits future work . The aNSCs also respond to the vmIPN modulus during cell differentiation . For example , GFAP , a marker of astrocytes , was uniform across vmIPN moduli , but cell number de - creased at lower stiffness ( Fig . 4 ) , indicating that softer vmIPN moduli selected against astrocytes , but did not affect the extent of differentiation of cells that did differentiate . In addition , b - tubulin III protein levels are known to increase progressively with neuronal differentiation during the early lineage commitment of aNSCs , and thus represent the extent of neuronal maturation ( 22 ) . Six days after FGF removal and retinoic - acid addition , staining revealed no overall difference in the percentage of b - tubulin III 1 cells as a function of substrate moduli ( data not shown ) . However , QRT - PCR and staining both showed that neurons have greater b - tubulin III mRNA and protein levels on vmIPNs of 500 – 1000 Pa ( Fig . 5 ) , indicating that modulus impacts neuronal maturation . Future studies involving pharmacologic inhibitors , geneti - cally modiﬁed NSCs , and global gene - expression analysis could probe potential stem - cell signaling and transcriptional networks that respond to stiffness ( 14 , 15 , 46 , 47 ) . Under conditions where cells undergo mixed differentiation ( serum and retinoic acid ) , the proportion of neurons progres - sively decreases and the fraction of astrocytes increases as vmIPN moduli increase ( Fig . 6 ) . This intriguing result could be attributable to an instructive role of modulus , where stiff - ness directly regulates cell - lineage commitment , or a selective role , where cells differentiate into the two lineages to the same extent on each surface , but survival is differentially favored at different stiffnesses . In support of a potential selective role , previous work with mixed rat embryonic ( E17 – E19 ) cortical progenitors showed that neuronal cell types engraft onto soft substrates better than glial cell types ( 21 ) . This interpretation is also consistent with the observation that astrocyte numbers decrease with softer moduli under astrocytic differentiation conditions ( Fig . 4 ) . However , the relative roles of instruction versus selection warrant further study . Full knowledge of the regulatory machinery specifying lineage commitment is lacking in aNSCs , but recent work indicated that speciﬁc basic - helix - loop - helix transcription factors control lineage commitment and neuronal differentiation in aNSCs ( M . J . Robertson and D . V . Schaffer , unpublished data ) . Our study used culture systems with physiologically rel - evant mechanical and biochemical properties , to advance both basic and applied stem - cell biology efforts . Adult NSCs ( 24 , 34 , 39 ) have different functional roles in vivo than do previously studied cells , including primary late embryonic neural cultures ( 21 , 41 , 48 ) or early postnatal differentiated neurons ( 20 ) . Moreover , our study examined cell behavior over a broad range of moduli , spanning native brain tissue , and with a speciﬁc well - deﬁned adhesion ligand , the bsp - RGD ( 15 ) peptide . Furthermore , we present novel quantita - tive data on self - renewal as a function of modulus . These results collectively suggest that optimal cell differentiation occurs in physiologically relevant environments . The optimal proliferation rate of dividing cells occurs near the stiffness of the brain ( E 9 (cid:2) 500 Pa ) , and biomedical applications that require scalable stem - cell expansion and differentiation could beneﬁt from using systems whose stiffness matches this modulus . Furthermore , local variation in stiffness could be used as a control parameter to tune cell differentiation in the brain , and stiffness could play a role in central nervous system pathology , including injury homing responses of NSCs to stiff glial scars or areas of hypoxia ( 49 ) . Finally , this work may provide design principles for tissue - engineering efforts involving injections of materials or materials plus cells into the adult brain or other central nervous system lo - cations . These possibilities merit future investigation . 4436 Saha et al . Biophysical Journal 95 ( 9 ) 4426 – 4438 CONCLUSIONS Synthetic vmIPN culture substrates with elastic moduli in the range of neural tissue were generated to explore the effects of modulus on adult neural stem - cell self - renewal and differ - entiation . Importantly , the synthesis procedure maintained a constant , well - deﬁned surface chemistry and peptide ligand density , so that the effects of substrate elastic modulus on stem - cell self - renewal and differentiation could be examined . The results demonstrated that aNSCs can self - renew and differentiate on RGD peptide - modiﬁed vmIPNs of $ 100 - Pa elastic modulus . In addition , the expression of a neuronal marker after 6 days of neuronal differentiation exhibited an optimum at vmIPNs of E 9 ; 500 Pa , and astrocyte numbers progressively decreased in softer materials under astrocyte differentiation conditions . Finally , the proportion of neurons versus glia under mixed differentiation is a strong function of modulus . These results demonstrate that tuning the me - chanical properties of a synthetic culture substrate offers a means to modulate or control neural stem - cell behavior . The authors thank R .
