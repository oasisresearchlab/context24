In this paper we show that all elusive groups G = N o G 1 with N an elementary abelian minimal normal subgroup and G 1 cyclic , can be constructed from transitive subgroups of AGL ( 1 , p 2 ) , for p a Mersenne prime , acting on the set of p ( p + 1 ) lines of the aﬃne plane AG ( 2 , p ) . 1 Introduction According to the Orbit - Counting Lemma ( see for example [ 1 , Theorem 2 . 2 ] ) , the average number of ﬁxed points of a ﬁnite permutation group acting on ∗ This paper forms part of an Australian Research Council Discovery project which supported the second author while the work for this paper was conducted . The ﬁrst author was supported by an Australian Postdoctoral Fellowship . † Current address : Via Libia , 29 , Padova 35141 PD , Italy 1 a ﬁnite set is the number of orbits . Since the identity ﬁxes all the points , it follows that a ﬁnite transitive permutation group of degree at least two must have a ﬁxed point free element . Using the Classiﬁcation of Finite Simple Groups , Fein , Kantor and Schacher [ 6 ] proved that there is actually a ﬁxed point free element of prime power order . However , there is not necessarily one of prime order as they demonstrated with the groups AGL ( 1 , p 2 ) for p a Mersenne prime acting on the set of p ( p + 1 ) lines of the aﬃne plane AG ( 2 , p ) . We call a ﬁnite transitive permutation group with no ﬁxed point free elements of prime order elusive . Any transitive subgroup of an elusive group is elusive and so we call any transitive subgroup of the elusive group AGL ( 1 , p 2 ) an FKS - group . Another example of an elusive permutation group is the Mathieu group M 11 in its action on 12 points . This contains AGL ( 1 , 9 ) and M 10 ∼ = A 6 . 2 as transitive subgroups . In fact , M 11 and M 10 in their actions on 12 points are the only elusive permutation groups which are almost simple [ 8 , Theorem 1 . 4 ] . It was also shown in [ 8 ] that the only elusive groups with a transitive minimal normal subgroup are the groups M 11 wr K acting on 12 k points with K a transitive subgroup of S k . More examples and constructions of elusive groups were given in [ 2 , 7 ] . The FKS - groups have abstract structure G = N o G 1 , where N is a minimal normal elementary abelian p - group G and G 1 is cyclic . Note that N has p + 1 orbits of length p . The elusive groups provided by the doubling construction in [ 2 , Theorem 3 . 3 ] using an FKS - group as input also have this abstract structure . The doubling construction was generalised in [ 7 ] ( see Construction 2 . 3 ) to a priming construction which multiplies the order of G 1 by a prime dividing p − 1 . Again all the groups constructed have abstract structure G = N o G 1 with N an elementary abelian p - group and G 1 cyclic . In this paper we prove that the groups yielded by the priming construction are the only elusive groups with this abstract structure . Theorem 1 . 1 . Let G be an elusive permutation group such that G = N o G 1 for N an elementary abelian minimal normal subgroup and G 1 cyclic . Then G can be obtained by repeatedly applying Construction 2 . 3 to an FKS - group . Corollary 1 . 2 . Let G be an elusive permutation group such that G = N o G 1 for N an elementary abelian minimal normal p - subgroup and G 1 cyclic . Then p = 2 l − 1 is a Mersenne prime , | N : N α | = p and the degree of G is p 2 j 0 r j 1 1 . . . r j t t where j 0 ≥ l , j 1 , . . . , j t ≥ 0 and r 1 , . . . , r t are distinct odd primes dividing p − 1 . 2 In [ 10 ] , a construction of Kantor is given as a possible source of elusive permutation groups . These groups are of the form G = N o G 1 where N ∼ = C dp and G 1 is a 2 - subgroup of the multiplicative group of GF ( p d ) . It was shown in [ 10 ] that when p = 3 this does in fact produce elusive permutation groups while the doubling construction in [ 2 ] shows that it produces examples for any Mersenne prime p . Theorem 1 . 1 shows that these are the only primes for which the construction produces elusive groups . The 2 - closure of a permutation group G acting on a set Ω is the largest subgroup of Sym ( Ω ) with the same set of orbits as G on the set Ω 2 . We say that G is 2 - closed if it is equal to its 2 - closure . The polycirculant conjecture ( see [ 2 ] ) states that every 2 - closed transitive permutation group has a ﬁxed point free element of prime order . The automorphism group of a digraph is 2 - closed , and Marusiˇc [ 12 ] originally asked if every vertex transitive digraph has a ﬁxed point free automorphism of prime order . This was later extended to 2 - closed groups by Klin [ 3 ] and has recently received a lot of attention , for example [ 2 , 4 , 5 , 8 , 9 , 13 ] . It was shown in [ 7 , p 2723 ] that the elusive permutation groups in Theorem 1 . 1 are not 2 - closed and that their 2 - closures are not elusive . 2 Priming and depriming We will need the following result about the representation theory of cyclic groups which follows from Schur’s Lemma . Lemma 2 . 1 . Let V be a d - dimensional vector space over GF ( q ) and G 1 a cyclic irreducible group of linear transformations of V . Then we can identify V with GF ( q d ) such that G 1 acts on V as a subgroup of GF ( q d ) ∗ with G 1 not contained in any proper subﬁeld of GF ( q d ) . In particular , | G 1 | is prime to q . If G is an elusive permutation group acting on the set Ω then every element g of prime order ﬁxes a point . Hence if α ∈ Ω , then g is conjugate to an element of G α . The following result is an application of this observation . Theorem 2 . 2 ( [ 2 ] Theorem 3 . 1 ) . Let G be a subgroup of GL ( V ) for some ﬁnite vector space V , and suppose that G has order prime to the characteristic of V . Let H be a subgroup of G , and U be an H - invariant proper subspace of V . Then the action of V o G on the set of right cosets of U o H is elusive if and only if the following hold : 3 ( i ) . The images of U by G cover V . ( ii ) . Every conjugacy class of elements of prime order in G meets H . We have the following priming construction from [ 7 ] . Construction 2 . 3 ( A priming construction ) . Let G = V o h a i be an elusive permutation group of degree p s l with point stabiliser H = U o h b i , where ( i ) . V is a ﬁnite dimensional vector space over GF ( p ) , ( ii ) . a ∈ GL ( V ) of order k , such that k is prime to p , ( iii ) . U is a codimension s subspace of V which is h b i - invariant . Let r be a prime which divides k . Let V 0 = V ⊕ V ⊕ · · · ⊕ V | { z } r copies and let g be the linear transformation in GL ( V ) wr S r of the vector space V 0 given by ( 1 , . . . , 1 , a ) τ where τ = ( 123 . . . r ) permutes the r copies of V . Next let U 0 = U ⊕ V ⊕ V ⊕ · · · ⊕ V | { z } r − 1 copies . Then U 0 is M - invariant , where M = h ( b , . . . , b ) i . Finally , let G ∗ = V 0 o h g i and H ∗ = U 0 o M . Theorem 2 . 4 . [ 7 , Theorem 2 . 6 ] Let G ∗ and H ∗ be as obtained from Con - struction 2 . 3 . Then the action of G ∗ on the set of right cosets of H ∗ is elusive of degree p s lr . An important part of our proof of Theorem 1 . 1 is the following depriming theorem . Theorem 2 . 5 . Suppose that G = V o G 1 is an elusive permutation group with point stabiliser H = U o H 1 such that V ∼ = GF ( q ) d and G 1 = h g i is a cyclic irreducible subgroup of GL ( d , q ) . Suppose that there is a decomposition V = V 1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ V t preserved by G 1 such that U = U 1 ⊕ V 2 ⊕ · · · ⊕ V t . Then V 1 o h g t i acts elusively on the set of right cosets of U 1 o H 1 . Moreover , G can be reconstructed from the elusive action of V 1 o h g t i via Construction 2 . 3 . 4 Proof . Let e 11 , e 12 , . . . , e 1 r be a basis for V 1 and for j = 2 , . . . , t , let e ji = e g j − 1 1 i for each i = 1 , . . . , r . Then { e ji | i = 1 , . . . , r , j = 1 , . . . , t } is a basis for V . Moreover , with respect to this basis g = ( 1 , . . . , 1 , a ) τ where a ∈ GL ( r , q ) and τ = ( 12 . . . t ) cyclically permutes the V i . Then g t = ( a , . . . , a ) and since G 1 is irreducible we have that h a i is an irreducible subgroup of GL ( r , q ) . Thus h g t i acts faithfully and irreducibly on V 1 . Moreover , since H 1 ﬁxes U , it follows that H 1 6 h g t i . As G 1 is cyclic and irreducible , Lemma 2 . 1 implies that | G 1 | is coprime to p and so by Theorem 2 . 2 , every element of prime order in G 1 is in H 1 . Thus every element of prime order in h g t i lies in H 1 . Let v ∈ V 1 . Then v 0 = ( v , . . . , v ) ∈ V and so by Theorem 2 . 2 , there exists g i such that ( v 0 ) g i ∈ U . Thus U 1 6 = { 0 } and there exists j such that v a j ∈ U 1 . Hence ( v 0 ) g tj ∈ U . Thus the set of images of U 1 under h g t i covers V 1 and so by Theorem 2 . 2 , the action of V 1 o h g t i on the set of right cosets of U 1 o H 1 is elusive . The fact that G can be reconstructed from V 1 o h g t i using Construction 2 . 3 follows from the representation of g as ( 1 , . . . , 1 , a ) τ . 3 Proof of main theorem We will have the following setup throughout this section and as such , these will be referred to collectively as Hypothesis 1 . Hypothesis 1 . Let G = V o G 1 be an elusive permutation group with point stabiliser H = U o H 1 , where ( i ) . V = GF ( q ) d with q = p f for some prime p and positive integer d ≥ 2 , ( ii ) . G 1 = h g i 6 GF ( q d ) ∗ and is irreducible , ( iii ) . | G 1 | = n and the primes dividing n also divide q − 1 , ( iv ) . U < V and dim U = e ≥ 1 , ( v ) . H 1 6 GF ( q ) ∗ , ( vi ) . H 1 < G 1 with m = | H 1 | and U is H 1 - invariant . We begin by showing that an elusive permutation group satisfying the conditions of Theorem 1 . 1 is of the form given in Hypothesis 1 . 5 Lemma 3 . 1 . Let G be an elusive permutation group such that G = N o G 1 for N an elementary abelian minimal normal subgroup and G 1 cyclic . Then G satisﬁes Hypothesis 1 . Proof . Let Ω be the set upon which G acts and α ∈ Ω . Suppose that | N | = p r for some prime p . Then N is an r - dimensional vector space over GF ( p ) . Since N C G , there exists a homomorphism φ : G 1 → GL ( r , p ) . Let K be the kernel of φ . Suppose that K 6 = 1 and let r be a prime dividing | K | and h ∈ K be an element of order r . Since G 1 is cyclic , h h i C G 1 and as h centralises N , we also have h h i C G . Since G is elusive , all elements of prime order in G are conjugate to an element of G α , and so h ∈ G α . Thus G α contains a normal subgroup of G , contradicting G acting faithfully on Ω . Thus K = 1 and so G 1 is isomorphic to a subgroup of GL ( r , p ) . Since N is a minimal normal subgroup of G it follows that G 1 is irreducible . By Lemma 2 . 1 , we can identify N with GF ( p r ) such that G 1 6 GF ( p r ) ∗ . Since all nontrivial elements of N are conjugate to an element of G α and hence of N α it follows that N α 6 = 1 and by the faithfulness of G we have that N α 6 = N . Moreover , since the elements of G 1 of prime order are conjugate to elements of G α , and these elements do not have order p , it follows that G α = N α o H 1 for some nontrivial subgroup H 1 of G 1 such that every prime dividing | G 1 | divides | H 1 | . Let V = N and U = N α . Now N α is a GF ( p ) - subspace of V invariant under H 1 ( vi ) . Let GF ( p f ) be the largest subﬁeld of GF ( p r ) such that U is invariant under GF ( p f ) ∗ and let q = p f and d = r / f . As G 1 is irreducible , d ≥ 2 . Then V is a d - dimensional vector space over GF ( q ) ( i ) and U is an e - dimensional GF ( q ) - subspace with e ≥ 1 ( iv ) . Moreover , G 1 6 GF ( q d ) ∗ ( ii ) and the stabiliser in GF ( q d ) ∗ of U is GF ( q ) ∗ . Since U is H 1 invariant , we have H 1 6 GF ( q ) ∗ ( v ) and so has order dividing q − 1 . By Theorem 2 . 2 , every prime dividing | G 1 | divides | H 1 | , and so only primes dividing q − 1 divide | G 1 | ( iii ) . Thus G is as in Hypotheses 1 . We now deal with the case where d = 2 . Proposition 3 . 2 . Suppose Hypothesis 1 holds . If d = 2 then q is a Mersenne prime and G is an FKS - group . Proof . The dimension e of U is necessarily 1 and so we can assume U = GF ( q ) and V = GF ( q ) 2 . By Theorem 2 . 2 , V is covered by the images of U under G 1 so G 1 is transitive on the set of 1 - spaces of V ( of which there are q + 1 ) 6 and so q + 1 divides n = | G 1 | . Moreover , by Hypothesis 1 , all primes dividing n divide q − 1 . Thus if r is a prime dividing q + 1 , it divides q − 1 and so r = 2 . Since r was arbitrary we have q + 1 = 2 i and so q = 2 i − 1 . It follows from [ 11 ] that q is prime and so G is an FKS - group . In the remaining part of this section we will have cause to refer to the largest power of some integer a that divides another integer b . This quantity will be denoted µ a ( b ) . Lemma 3 . 3 . Let q be a positive integer and let r be an odd prime dividing q − 1 . Then µ r ( q d − 1 ) = µ r ( q − 1 ) µ r ( d ) Proof . First suppose µ r ( d ) = 1 . Since r | ( q − 1 ) we have q ≡ 1 ( mod r ) and so 1 + q + · · · + q d − 1 ≡ d ( mod r ) . But µ r ( d ) = 1 so r 6 | d giving r 6 | 1 + q + · · · + q d − 1 and so µ r ( q d − 1 ) = µ r ( q − 1 ) = µ r ( q − 1 ) µ r ( d ) . Now we show that µ r (cid:16) q ri + 1 − 1 q ri − 1 (cid:17) = r for i ≥ 0 . We can expand the fraction to q ri + 1 − 1 q ri − 1 = 1 + q r i + q 2 r i + q 3 r i + · · · + q ( r − 1 ) r i and since q ≡ 1 ( mod r ) we see that r divides q ri + 1 − 1 q ri − 1 . To see that r 2 does not divide q ri + 1 − 1 q ri − 1 note that if a , b < r then ( ar + b ) r ≡ b r ( mod r 2 ) ( using binomial expansion ) . Since q ≡ 1 ( mod r ) we have q r ≡ 1 ( mod r 2 ) and so q ri + 1 − 1 q ri − 1 ≡ r ( mod r 2 ) . Now let ν = µ r ( d ) and δ = d / ν . We have ( q d − 1 ) = ( q − 1 ) q r − 1 q − 1 q r 2 − 1 q r − 1 q r 3 − 1 q r 2 − 1 . . . q ν − 1 q ν / r − 1 ( q ν ) δ − 1 q ν − 1 and so the lemma follows from the previous two cases . Lemma 3 . 4 . Let q be an odd integer . Then µ 2 ( q d − 1 ) = (cid:26) µ 2 ( q − 1 ) if d is odd µ 2 ( q 2 − 1 ) µ 2 ( d ) 2 if d is even Proof . We have q d − 1 = ( q − 1 ) ( q d − 1 + · · · + q + 1 ) . If d is odd then q d − 1 + · · · + q + 1 ≡ 1 ( mod 2 ) and so µ 2 ( q d − 1 ) = µ 2 ( q − 1 ) . Suppose d is even . First note that since q is odd and − 1 is not a square mod 4 we have µ 2 ( q 2 i + 1 ) = 2 for all i > 0 . 7 Now let ν = µ 2 ( d ) and δ = d / ν . We have q d − 1 = ( q 2 − 1 ) q 4 − 1 q 2 − 1 q 8 − 1 q 4 − 1 . . . q ν − 1 q ν / 2 − 1 ( q ν ) δ − 1 q ν − 1 = ( q 2 − 1 ) ( q 2 + 1 ) ( q 4 + 1 ) ( q 8 + 1 ) . . . ( q ν / 2 + 1 ) ( q ν ) δ − 1 q ν − 1 and so the result follows from the previous two cases . We can now eliminate the case where d is a prime . Lemma 3 . 5 . Suppose Hypothesis 1 holds . Then d is not an odd prime di - viding q − 1 . Proof . Suppose to the contrary . Then by Lemmas 3 . 3 and 3 . 4 , µ d ( q d − 1 ) = dµ d ( q − 1 ) and µ 2 ( q d − 1 ) = µ 2 ( q − 1 ) . Thus there are at most d ≤ q − 1 images of U under G 1 . Since U contains at most q d − 1 − 1 nonzero vectors , the images of U under G 1 do not cover V . This contradicts Theorem 2 . 2 and so the result holds . We also show that if d is twice a prime then U is a hyperplane . Lemma 3 . 6 . Suppose that Hypothesis 1 holds and d = 2 r for some prime r dividing q − 1 . Then U is a hyperplane . Proof . Since n is only divisible by primes dividing q − 1 , Lemmas 3 . 3 and 3 . 4 imply that the only primes dividing n / m are 2 and r . Moreover , µ 2 ( q 2 r − 1 ) = µ 2 ( q 2 − 1 ) µ 2 ( r ) , while if r is odd then µ r ( q 2 r − 1 ) = rµ r ( q − 1 ) . It follows that U has at most rµ 2 ( q + 1 ) ≤ q 2 − 1 images under G 1 . Suppose that U is not a hyperplane . Then the images of U under G 1 cover at most ( q 2 − 1 ) ( q 2 r − 2 − 1 ) = q 2 r − q 2 r − 2 − q 2 + 1 < q d − 1 non - zero vectors of V . This contradicts the fact that the images of U under G 1 cover V ( Theorem 2 . 2 ) and so U is a hyperplane . Next we obtain some results concerning decompositions of V . Lemma 3 . 7 . Let g ∈ GL ( d , q ) act irreducibly on the vector space V = GF ( q ) d and suppose that all primes dividing n = | g | also divide q − 1 . If there is an odd prime r dividing q − 1 such that µ r ( n ) does not divide q − 1 then there is a decomposition V = V 1 ⊕ V 2 ⊕ · · · ⊕ V r preserved by h g i . Furthermore , h g r i is the stabiliser in h g i of V 1 . 8 Proof . By Lemma 2 . 1 , h g i can be considered as a subgroup of the multiplica - tive group GF ( q d ) ∗ acting on V ∼ = GF ( q d ) . Thus n divides q d − 1 . Since r divides q − 1 but µ r ( n ) does not , it follows from Lemma 3 . 3 that r divides d . Moreover , µ r ( q d − 1 ) = µ r ( q − 1 ) µ r ( d ) = rµ r ( q − 1 ) µ r ( d / r ) = rµ r ( q d / r − 1 ) Now for every prime divisor r 0 6 = r of n , it also follows from Lemma 3 . 3 that µ r 0 ( q d − 1 ) = µ r 0 ( q d / r − 1 ) . So n / r = | g r | divides q d / r − 1 and therefore h g r i is a subgroup of GF ( q d / r ) ∗ . Now still identifying V with the additive group of GF ( q d ) we see that there is a h g r i - invariant GF ( q ) - subspace , namely the subﬁeld V 1 = GF ( q d / r ) . The images V 1 , V 2 , . . . , V r of V 1 under h g i are also h g r i - invariant since h g r i is a normal subgroup of h g i . Furthermore , the V i span a h g i - invariant subspace of V . Since h g i is irreducible it follows that the V i span V . By considering their dimensions we see that they form the required decomposition . Lemma 3 . 8 . Let g ∈ GL ( d , q ) act irreducibly on the vector space V = GF ( q ) d and suppose that all primes dividing n = | g | also divide q − 1 . Furthermore , suppose that d > 2 and n = 2 i n 0 > 2 with n 0 odd and dividing q − 1 . Then there is a decomposition V = V 1 ⊕ V 2 preserved by G 1 . Furthermore , h g r i is the stabiliser in h g i of V 1 . Proof . By Lemma 2 . 1 , h g i can be considered as a subgroup of the multi - plicative group GF ( q d ) ∗ acting on V ∼ = GF ( q d ) . Thus n divides q d − 1 . Moreover , by Lemmas 3 . 3 and 3 . 4 , if r is an odd prime dividing d then n divides q d / r − 1 , contradicting h g i being irreducible . Thus d is a power of 2 . For every odd prime divisor r of n , it also follows from Lemma 3 . 3 that µ r ( q d − 1 ) = µ r ( q d / 2 − 1 ) . Since d is a power of 2 , Lemma 3 . 4 implies that µ 2 ( q d − 1 ) = µ 2 ( q 2 − 1 ) µ 2 ( d ) 2 = 2 µ 2 ( q 2 − 1 ) µ 2 ( d / 4 ) = 2 µ 2 ( q d / 2 − 1 ) So n / 2 = | g 2 | divides q d / 2 − 1 and therefore h g 2 i is a subgroup of GF ( q d / 2 ) ∗ . The rest of the proof then follows along exactly the same lines as the proof for Lemma 3 . 7 . Lemma 3 . 9 . Let νr = d and let q , ν , r , d all be natural numbers with ν > 2 and q > 1 . Then q d − 1 q ν − 1 ( q ν − 1 − 1 ) > q d − 2 − 1 9 Proof . Let Q = q ν . Then q d − 1 q ν − 1 ( q ν − 1 − 1 ) > q d − 2 − 1 ⇐⇒ Q r − 1 Q − 1 ( Qq − 1 − 1 ) > Q r q − 2 − 1 ⇐⇒ r − 1 X i = 0 Q i ! Qq − 1 − r − 1 X i = 0 Q i ! > Q r q − 2 − 1 ⇐⇒ Q r q − 1 + r − 2 X i = 0 Q i ! Qq − 1 − r − 1 X i = 1 Q i ! − 1 > Q r q − 2 − 1 ⇐⇒ r − 1 X i = 1 Q i ! q − 1 − r − 1 X i = 1 Q i ! > Q r q − 2 − Q r q − 1 ⇐⇒ r − 1 X i = 1 Q i ! ( q − 1 − 1 ) > Q r q − 1 ( q − 1 − 1 ) ⇐⇒ r − 1 X i = 1 Q i < Q r q − 1 ⇐⇒ 1 + r − 1 X i = 1 Q i ≤ Q r q − 1 ⇐⇒ q d − 1 q ν − 1 ≤ q d − 1 ⇐⇒ q d − 1 ≤ q d − 1 ( q ν − 1 ) ⇐⇒ q d − 1 q − 1 ≤ q d − 1 q ν − 1 q − 1 ⇐⇒ d − 1 X i = 0 q i ≤ d − 2 + ν X i = d − 1 q i ⇐⇒ q d − 1 − 1 q − 1 ≤ q d + q d + 1 + · · · + q d − 2 + ν The last inequality holds as the left hand side is less than q d − 1 which is less than each term on the right hand side . Thus the result holds . A secumdum of a vector space is a subspace of codimension two . 10 Lemma 3 . 10 . Suppose that U is a secundum of V = GF ( q d ) considered as a GF ( q ) - vector space and that V has a decomposition V 1 ⊕· · ·⊕ V r with each V i invariant under GF ( q d / r ) ∗ for some prime divisor r of d with d / r > 2 . Then there is a ( possibly diﬀerent ) decomposition V 0 1 ⊕ V 0 2 ⊕ · · · ⊕ V 0 r with each V 0 i invariant under GF ( q d / r ) ∗ such that U = U 0 1 ⊕ V 0 2 ⊕ · · · ⊕ V 0 r where U 0 1 has codimension 2 in V 0 1 . Proof . Since GF ( q d ) ∗ is transitive on the set of nonzero vectors of V the images of V 1 under GF ( q d ) ∗ cover V . Since GF ( q d / r ) ∗ is the stabiliser of V 1 in GF ( q d ) ∗ , the number of images of V 1 is q d − 1 q ν − 1 , where ν = dr . As V 1 contains q ν − 1 non - zero vectors , it follows that every non - zero vector of V lies in a unique image of V 1 under GF ( q d ) ∗ . We denote this set of images by S . Since U has codimension 2 in V and ν > 2 , it follows that each element of S meets U in a nontrivial subspace of dimension ν , ν − 1 or ν − 2 . We wish to show that there is at least one element of S that intersects U in a subspace of codimension 2 . Suppose that there is no such subspace . Then each element of { U ∩ W : W ∈ S } contains at least q ν − 1 − 1 non - zero vectors . Since | S | = q d − 1 q ν − 1 and each non - zero vector of V lies in a unique element of S , this gives q d − 1 q ν − 1 ( q ν − 1 − 1 ) non - zero vectors . By Lemma 3 . 9 this is greater than q d − 2 − 1 , the number of non - zero vectors in U , a contradiction . Thus there must be at least one image V h 1 of V 1 under GF ( q d ) ∗ that intersects U in a subspace of codimension 2 . Setting V 0 i = V hi we obtain the required decomposition . Proposition 3 . 11 . Suppose Hypothesis 1 holds with d ≥ 3 and suppose that there is a prime r dividing q − 1 with µ r ( n ) not dividing q − 1 with the following conditions : ( a ) if r = 2 then r is the only prime divisor of n with µ r ( n ) not dividing q − 1 ; ( b ) if d / r = 2 then U is a hyperplane . Then there is a dimension d / r subspace V 1 of V containing another subspace U 1 such that V 1 o h g r i acts elusively on the set of cosets of U 1 o H 1 . Moreover , if e < d − 1 then we can take U 1 to be an H 1 - invariant secundum of V , while if e = d − 1 then U 1 is a hyperplane of V 1 and the elusive permutation group G can be reconstructed from V 1 o h g r i via Construction 2 . 3 . 11 Proof . By Lemma 3 . 5 , d / r ≥ 2 . It follows from Lemmas 3 . 7 or 3 . 8 that there is a decomposition V = V 1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ V r preserved by h g i with each V i invariant under h g r i . First suppose that U is a hyperplane and let U 0 = U 1 ⊕ V 2 ⊕ · · · ⊕ V r , where U 1 is a hyperplane of V 1 . Now G 1 C GF ( q d ) ∗ and GF ( q d ) ∗ is transitive on hyperplanes and so there exists h ∈ GF ( q d ) ∗ which maps U to U 0 . Moreover , h induces an automorphism of G which maps U o H 1 to U 0 o H 1 . Thus the action of G on the set of cosets of U o H 1 is equivalent to the action of G on the set of cosets of U 0 o H 1 . Thus without loss of generality we may replace U with U 0 . Then by Theorem 2 . 5 , V 1 o h g r i acts elusively on the set of cosets of U 1 o h h i and G can be reconstructed from V 1 o h g r i via Construction 2 . 3 . Now suppose that U is not a hyperplane . Then U is contained in a secundum U 0 . Moreover , since H 1 6 GF ( q ) ∗ , we have that U 0 is H 1 - invariant and since the set of images of U under G 1 covers V , so does the set of images of U 0 under G 1 . Hence by Theorem 2 . 2 , G = V o G 1 also acts elusively on the set of cosets of U 0 o H 1 . By Lemma 3 . 10 , we may assume that ( changing the decomposition if necessary ) U 0 = U 1 ⊕ V 2 ⊕· · ·⊕ V r where U 1 has codimension 2 in V 1 . By Theorem 2 . 5 , it follows that V 1 o h g r i acts elusively on the set of cosets of U 1 o h h i . We can now prove Theorem 1 . 1 . Proof of Theorem 1 . 1 . By Lemma 3 . 1 , we may take G as in Hypothesis 1 . The theorem is proved by induction on d . If d = 2 then G is an FKS - group by Proposition 3 . 2 . Suppose d > 2 . Since the images of U under G 1 cover V , it follows that n does not divide q − 1 . Thus we are in one of the following two cases . ( i ) . There is an odd prime r 0 such that µ r 0 ( n ) does not divide q − 1 . ( ii ) . n = 2 i n 0 with n 0 odd and dividing q − 1 and 2 i not dividing q − 1 . If ( i ) holds let r = r 0 while if ( ii ) holds let r = 2 . By Lemma 3 . 5 and the fact that d > 2 , we have d 6 = r and so d / r ≥ 2 . By Lemma 3 . 6 we may assume that if d = 2 r then U is a hyperplane . Thus we can apply Proposition 3 . 11 to obtain a new elusive group G 0 = V 1 o h g r i with point stabiliser U 1 o H 1 satisfying Hypothesis 1 such that V 1 has dimension d / r and U 1 < V 1 . Since d / r < d , the inductive hypothesis implies that G 0 can be obtained by repeatedly applying Construction 2 . 3 to an FKS - group and that U 1 is a hyperplane of V 1 . Thus by Proposition 3 . 11 , G can be reconstructed 12 from G 0 by applying Construction 2 . 3 using the prime r and hence is obtained by repeatedly applying Construction 2 . 3 to an FKS - group .
