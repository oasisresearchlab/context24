Values - led Participatory Design with Children : Reflection on Action Abstract We describe a values - led participatory design ( PD ) process with children in a project that aimed to tackle bullying in the social context of the class . Children collaborated in small teams to think of ideas and co - construct solutions that would increase their self - regulation in the prevention and intervention of bully - ing . The resulting artifacts and their verbal explanation were analyzed beyond the surface level of children’s ideas to identify the underlying discourse and values . This was an interpretative process for which we relied on the GLID method . In this paper , we present the PD process and we reflect on topics for further research . Author Keywords Participatory Design ; Co - design ; Values ; Children Introduction PD is a well - known methodology that can be useful in the fuzzy front end of design , to determine the specific experiences to aim for when designing technology . Future users are at the core of the methodology : in PD , these users are considered co - designers of their tech - nology , and of the practices that may be reified in that technology . In an attempt to determine the specific experiences to design for , recent work by Iversen et al . [ 1 ] has attempted to rekindle values in a more ‘authen - tic’ approach towards PD .

Instead of taking values for granted , Iversen et al . start from the emergent values as ‘the engine that drives the design process’ [ 1 ] . The project discussed in this paper fits within this values - led approach to PD . The aim of the project is to tackle bullying in the social context of the class group . In what follows , we first discuss the PD process and how we accounted for values . Then , we briefly reflect on the process and discuss topics for future work , relevant for the CHI workshop on Values in Computing . Participatory Design Process Overall Scope of the Project The overall scope of the project was to empower chil - dren by enabling self - regulation in tackling bullying , both in prevention and intervention . To this end , we wanted to develop digital , tangible tools to facilitate children to take their own initiative to create a safe class environment . Whereas most existing approaches to combat bullying focus on either traditional or cyber bullying , this study looked at the interrelationship and how both forms manifest themselves in the social con - text of the class . We conducted two studies to better define the problem space . First , we involved teachers and educational experts in a series of mapping sessions . Afterwards , we involved children in two co - design sessions . Based on a comparative analysis of the results of the mapping and co - design studies , we formulated a set of design rec - ommendations . Here , we reflect on the co - design ses - sions : ( 1 ) how we enabled children to voice their opin - ions and ideas , and ( 2 ) how we analyzed the co - design outcomes by looking beyond the surface level of chil - dren’s ideas to identify underlying values . Co - design Sessions with Children 49 children aged 9 to 10 were involved in a series of co - design sessions in two schools in Flanders , Belgium . Our aim to design tangible , digital tools to make class groups more self - regulatory in tackling bullying was translated into an understandable design challenge for children : What tools would improve the class atmos - phere and prevent bullying ? This focus on prevention was suggested by the teachers and experts during the mapping sessions . To make it more tangible , we used a fictional story of a class with a negative atmosphere as a starting point . In the story , our own values with re - gard to the problem of bullying were embedded : we aspired a proactive approach that would increase chil - dren’s self - regulative behavior , with the ultimate goal to create a safe environment for children . Although we started from these preliminary value orientations ( pre - vention , increasing self - regulation ) and from a broad view on what was to be designed ( tangible , digital tools ) , these preliminary ideas were open to change . During the co - design sessions , we allowed children’s work to broaden our perspective . Over a period of one month , two co - design sessions were organized in two primary schools ( 150 minutes each ) preceded by a general introduction ( 50 minutes ) , resulting in three visits per school . The first author facilitated all sessions . For a detailed description of the co - design procedure that was used , we refer to [ 2 ] [ 3 ] . During the introduction we explained the overall design challenge and introduced the fictional story . We fur - thermore introduced four individual assignments to trigger children’s reflections about the design challenge and to prepare them for the co - design sessions . The aim of the first co - design session was to create cohe - sive teams and , for each team , to define two problems based on the story and the design challenge . The aim of the second co - design session was to design and prototype tools to tackle bullying in class . Each team brainstormed , grouped and selected ideas and built a three - dimensional prototype incorporating these ideas . For this purpose , teams received a bag full of prototyp - ing materials . The session ended with presentations and a short group discussion about how we would take their designs forward in the next design stages . The co - design sessions resulted in various outcomes that were analyzed with the GLID method [ 4 ] . With GLID , verbal , material and other co - design outcomes are integrated in a structured and coherent analysis . GLID aims to go beyond the surface level of ideas , by identifying participants’ values embedded in co - design outcomes . Following the GLID procedure , we looked at the evolution from initial ideas to final solution , the proposed functional and non - functional attributes , the solution’s orientation ( i . e . , how it intervenes and changes a particular social reality ) , organization ( i . e . , how it presents a coherent solution ) and , finally , its underlying socially - shared values [ 4 ] . After this analysis per team , the results were compared across teams , and with the viewpoints of teachers and educational experts ( a paper about the results and design guidelines is currently under review ) . Discussion and conclusion The goal of the co - design activities was to generate ideas for future technologies and practices that would cope with bullying behavior in school . The co - design techniques served as constructivist tools to assist in - vestigations of ‘what may be’ rather than simply ‘what is’ . The simultaneous act of making and reflection in the co - design activities increased children’s awareness about the complexity of bullying behavior and how to establish and maintain a good class atmosphere . For example , a team of 5 children , The Collaborators , in - vented a Hypnotize Machine . With this industrial look - ing object , victims can hypnotize their bullies so they will not laugh at them again . Sad children can also use the machine to hypnotize themselves to become happy . The teacher regulates the use of the machine . Overall , children collaborated constructively while nego - tiating and building a solution . However , they did not explicitly discuss their values and value trade - off pro - cesses . This may be due to children’s developmental characteristics . The participants were 9 to 10 years old and although they were verbal and self - reflective enough to discuss what they were thinking , according to Piaget children’s abstract thinking skills are only beginning to develop at this age [ 5 ] . This implies that , when it comes to abstract concepts such as ‘values’ , 9 - to 10 - year - olds may still have a difficult time verbaliz - ing their thoughts and much of what they say needs to be interpreted in relation to concrete experiences [ 5 ] . Co - design techniques proved to be particularly useful here , because the making activities stimulated ad hoc reflection and children did not have to think about complex and abstract issues without specific reference materials . In addition , since values are critical motiva - tors for people’s attitudes and behavior [ 6 ] [ 7 ] , the way in which children approached the design challenge and co - constructed a solution told us something about their values . The artifact ( e . g . , the Hypnotize Machine ) and its verbal explanation were the result of a collective sense - making process in which children’s negotiated values were embedded , be it implicitly . This process , which Ehn [ 8 ] refers to as collective reflection - in - action , is at the heart of PD . With the GLID method [ 4 ] , we were able to arrive at a situated understanding of the values that underpin these co - design outcomes . For instance , the values deduced from the Hypnotize Ma - chine and its verbal explanation include a focus on ‘victim empowerment’ and a combination of ‘top - down with bottom - up regulation’ to tackle bullying in class . Values resulting from other co - design outcomes are ‘positively reinforcing victims’ , ‘facilitating collaborative and pretend play’ , and ‘supporting emotional literacy’ . Deducing these values was an interpretative process . Since the process of interpretation is not value free , multiple and equally valid interpretations can co - exist . This means that , when other researchers would have analyzed the data relying on the GLID method , it could have resulted in different readings . Therefore , it is important to be aware of the values that you bring to the co - design process , and to explicate how these val - ues influenced your interpretation . This type of reflexiv - ity is important to increase transparency and avoid confirmation bias . This aligns with Frauenberger et al . [ 9 ] who recently called for more internal rigor and accountability in PD practices . On a final note , since children were not involved in the analysis , it is important to debrief them about the re - sults and to continue their participation . The emergent values should be reconsidered when developing and testing the technology . References [ 1 ] O . S . Iversen , K . Halskov , and T . W .
