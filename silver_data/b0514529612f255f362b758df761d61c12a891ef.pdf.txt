In the present study , the ability of turbot IgM þ B cells to ingest microspheres of different sizes and the cor - responding internalization pathways were investigated . The results showed that IgM þ B cells exhibited relatively high endocytic capacities for 0 . 5 m m and 1 m m latex beads , and that different mechanisms were employed for IgM þ and IgM (cid:2) cells to uptake 0 . 5 m m and 1 m m beads . For 0 . 5 m m beads , IgM þ B cells apparently employed macropinocytosis - dependent endocytic pathway , whereas IgM (cid:2) cells utilized a different process involving both clathrin - and caveolae - mediated pathways . For the uptake of 1 m m beads , IgM þ cells relied mainly on macropinocytosis and partially on caveolae - mediated pathway , while IgM (cid:2) cells utilized the routes similar to that of internalizing 0 . 5 m m beads . Consistently , the internalized microspheres were co - localized with high - molecular - mass dextran in IgM þ phagocytic cells . In addition to latex beads , IgM þ B cells could also ingest inactivated bacteria predominately through macro - pinocytosis and caveolae - mediated endocytosis . These results collectively indicated that macro - pinocytosis is principally responsible for particle uptake by turbot IgM þ B cells . © 2018 Elsevier Ltd . All rights reserved . 1 . Introduction It has been recognized that vertebrate B cells have potent endocytic activities , in addition to their performance as Ab - producing cells . In rainbow trout , particles could be ingested by B cells , and phagocytic B cells have been demonstrated to have phagolysosome formation and serial downstream degradative ac - tivities ( Li et al . , 2006 ) . Zebra ﬁ sh B cells showed potent abilities to uptake and present both soluble antigens and bacterial particles to prime naïve CD4 þ T cell activation ( Zhu et al . , 2014 ) . Endocytic B cells have so far been identi ﬁ ed in many ﬁ sh species , such as lump ﬁ sh ( Cyclopterus lumpus L . ) , half - smooth tongue sole ( Cyn - oglossus semilaevis ) , Atlantic salmon ( Salmo salar L . ) and Atlantic cod ( Gadus morhua L . ) ( Ghebretnsae et al . , 2015 ; Øverland et al . , 2010 ; Yang et al . , 2017 ) ; and similar phenomenon was also con ﬁ rmed in amphibians , reptiles and mammals ( Li et al . , 2006 ; Parra et al . , 2012 ; Zimmerman et al . , 2010 ) . These ﬁ ndings sug - gest that innate endocytic capacity is evolutionarily conserved in B cells from ﬁ sh to mammals . In teleost ﬁ sh , leukocytes , macrophages , granulocytes , and monocytes are considered professional phagocytic cells , while B cells are non - professional phagocytic cells ( Ainsworth , 1992 ; Neumann et al . , 2001 ; Rønneseth et al . , 2007 ; Rabinovitch , 1995 ; Rowley and Ratcliffe , 1988 ) . The most important difference be - tween professional and non - professional phagocytes is that the former have higher endocytic capacity for a more extensive range of particles ( Rabinovitch , 1995 ) . For example , the phagocytic capability of salmon B cells is much lower than for neutrophils ( Øverland et al . , 2010 ) . However , the underling mechanism for the different phagocytic activities between professional and non - professional phagocytes is still unclear . In teleost ﬁ sh , B cells have been reported to produce three types * Corresponding author . School of Biological Sciences , Lake Superior State Uni - versity Sault Ste .

Among them , IgM is the predominant isotype , including membrane IgM as a monomer and secreting soluble IgM as a tetramer ( Edholm et al . , 2010 ; Hansen et al . , 2005 ; Warr et al . , 1979 ) . IgM þ B cells are the predominant B cells in the peripheral blood leukocytes ( PBL ) of teleost ﬁ sh like salmon and rainbow trout , and are specialized in systemic immu - nity ( Li et al . , 2006 ; Øverland et al . , 2010 ) . Endocytosis pathways have been subdivided into four cate - gories , including clathrin - dependent endocytosis , caveolae , mac - ropinocytosis and phagocytosis ( Doherty and McMahon , 2009 ; Ehrlich et al . , 2004 ) . In clathrin - mediated endocytosis , ( which is fundamental to neurotransmission , signal transduction and regu - lation of many plasma membrane activities ) , the cargo is packaged into vesicles with the aid of a clathrin coat ( Ferguson et al . , 2017 ; McMahon and Boucrot , 2011 ) . It has been reported that human B cells possess two distinct endocytic pathways for extracellular particles , which contain clathrin - coated pits and plasma membrane lipid rafts ( Putnam et al . , 2003 ) . Macropinocytosis is a highly conserved endocytic process by which extracellular ﬂ uid and large particles are internalized into cells through large , heterogeneous vesicles known as macropinosomes ( Commisso et al . , 2013 ; Marques et al . , 2017 ) . In Raji B cells , the internalization of non - speci ﬁ c bacteria was through macropinocytosis ( García - P (cid:1) erez et al . , 2012 ) . However , the endocytic pathways of ﬁ sh B cells involving in particle internalization are unknown . In this study , we aimed to gain better understanding of B cell endocytosis in teleost ﬁ sh . For this purpose , the ef ﬁ ciency of turbot IgM þ B cells ingesting particles of different sizes as well as the involved internalization pathways were investigated through the use of ﬂ ow cytometry , confocal microscopy , scanning electron mi - croscopy and endocytic inhibitors . Our results indicate that particle - uptake of turbot IgM þ B cells is mediated by macro - pinocytosis and limited to particles of a certain size . 2 . Materials and methods 2 . 1 . Fish Turbot ( Scophthalmus maximus ) , 18 e 20 cm in length and 600 e 800 g inweight , were obtained from a commercial ﬁ sh farm in Shandong Province , China and maintained at 19 e 20 (cid:3) C in aerated seawater . Before experimentation , ﬁ sh were acclimatized to labo - ratory conditions for two weeks and con ﬁ rmed to be absent of speci ﬁ c bacterial pathogens . Blood was collected from the caudal vein of turbot after the ﬁ sh were euthanized by being immersed in tricaine methanesulfonate solution ( Sigma , St . Louis , USA ) at a dose of 0 . 1 g / L in sterilized seawater . 2 . 2 . Fluorescent microspheres and bacteria Fluorescent microsphere beads ( Fluoresbrite R Yellow Green , l ex , 445 nm ; l em , 500 nm ) , sized 0 . 1 , 0 . 5 , 1 and 2 m m in diameter , were purchased from Polysciences ( Warrington , PA , USA ) . Escher - ichia coli DH5 a was cultured in LB medium to an OD 600 of 0 . 8 and inactivated with 0 . 4 % formaldehyde . For FITC conjugation , E . coli ( 1 (cid:4) 10 7 CFU ) were re - suspended in 200 mg / mL FITC ( Tiangen , Beijing , China ) dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide for 2 h , washed three times with PBS to remove unbound FITC , and adjusted to appro - priate concentrations . 2 . 3 . Isolation of peripheral blood leukocytes ( PBL ) Turbot PBL were prepared as reported previously ( Liu et al . , 2010 ) . Brie ﬂ y , blood was diluted immediately 1 : 4 with L15 cul - ture medium ( Jinuo , Hangzhou , China ) with 10 units / mL heparin ( Solarbio , Beijing , China ) . The diluted blood was then placed on the top of 1 . 070 g / mL Percoll ( GE Healthcare , Uppsala , Sweden ) and centrifuged at 400 (cid:4) g for 15 min . The red blood cell pellet was discarded , and the layer containing PBL was collected and washed twice with L - 15 medium ( Gibco , Carlsbad , USA ) , followed by sus - pension in L15 - medium containing 4 % calf serum ( Gibco , Carlsbad , USA ) , 100 U / mL penicillin ( Solarbio , Beijing , China ) , 100 m g / mL streptomycin ( Solarbio , Beijing , China ) , and 10 units / mL heparin . 2 . 4 . Phagocytosis assessment by ﬂ ow cytometry The phagocytic capacity of turbot PBL was evaluated as previ - ously reported ( Li et al . , 2006 ) . Brie ﬂ y , PBL ( 1 (cid:4) 10 6 cells / mL ) were cultured for 4 h at 20 (cid:3) C withyellowgreen microsphere beads of 0 . 1 , 0 . 5 , 1 , 2 m m in diameter at a cell / bead ratio of 1 / 10 . Non - ingested beads were removed by centrifugation ( 100 (cid:4) g for 10 min at 4 (cid:3) C ) by loading the cell suspension over a cushion of 3 % Bovine Serum Albumin ( BSA ) ( Aikerbo , Qingdao , China ) in PBS supplemented with 4 . 5 % D - glucose ( Sigma , USA ) . Then , the phagocytic cells were resuspended in L - 15 medium and incubated with 5 m g / mL mouse - anti - turbot IgM monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) ( Aquatic Diagnostics Ltd , Stirling , Scotland ) ( Feng et al . , 2009 ; Huo et al . , 2017 ) for 1 h at 20 (cid:3) C , followed by staining with Phycoerythrin ( PE ) - conjugated goat anti - mouse IgG ( Abcam , Shanghai , China ) for 1 h at 20 (cid:3) C . After washing , the ﬂ uorescence signals were determined by a FACScan ( FACS ) ﬂ ow cytometer ( BD Biosciences , USA ) . FlowJo was used for ﬂ ow cytometric analysis . 2 . 5 . Confocal microscopy Five hundred microliters of PBL suspension ( 10 5 cells / mL ) and yellow green microsphere beads of 0 . 5 or 1 m m in diameter were added to a confocal dish ( 35 mm ) at the ratio of 1 : 10 . The dish was incubated for 4 h at 20 (cid:3) C , and the cells were ﬁ xed with 4 % para - formaldehyde ( Solarbio , Beijing , China ) and blocked with 3 % BSA for 30 min . The cells were stained with 5 m g / mL mouse - anti - turbot IgM mAb for 1 h at 20 (cid:3) C , and then with Alexa Fluor 594 labeled - goat anti - mouse IgG ( Abcam , Shanghai ) for 1 h at 20 (cid:3) C . After washing , the cells were stained with 4 ’ , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ( DAPI , 10 m g / mL ) ( Solarbio , Beijing , China ) . The cells were washed again as above and examined with a confocal mi - croscope ( Zesis LSM710 , Germany ) . 2 . 6 . Cell sorting and scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) Turbot PBL were incubated with mouse anti - turbot IgM mAb and PE - conjugated goat anti - mouse IgG as above . Then IgM þ cells were sorted out by using FACScan ﬂ ow cytometer ( BD Biosciences ) sorting system and collected in tubes containing L - 15 medium , 4 % calf serum , 100 U / mL penicillin and 100 m g / mL streptomycin . For Scanning Electron Microscopy ( SEM ) analysis , sorted cells were ﬁ xed with 2 . 5 % glutaraldehyde in PBS on a glass coverslip coated with 0 . 1 % poly - L - lysine ; dehydrated in graded ethanol solutions , freeze - dried using t - butyl alcohol and coated with gold . The spec - imens were then examined with a high resolution ﬁ eld emission scanning electron microscope S - 3400N ( HITACHI , Japan ) . 2 . 7 .

Effect of endocytic inhibitors on the uptake of microspheres by IgM þ cells To determine the uptake pathways of IgM þ B cells , clathrin - dependent endocytosis was blocked with CPZ and dynasore , caveolin - dependent endocytosis pathway was blocked by M - b - CD and nystatin , and macropinocytosis was blocked by IPA - 3 and NSC23766 . As shown by FACS analysis , the endocytic rate of IgM þ B cells for 0 . 5 m m beads decreased signi ﬁ cantly ( P < . 05 ) in the pres - ence of IPA - 3 and NSC23766 , but not in the presence of CPZ , dynasore , M - b - CD , or nystatin ( Fig . 4 ; Fig . S1 ) . In contrast , the up - take activity of IgM (cid:2) cells was signi ﬁ cantly reduced ( P < . 05 ) in the presence of CPZ , dynasore , M - b - CD , and nystatin , but was not affected in the presence of IPA - 3 or NSC23766 ( Fig . 4 ; Fig .

The endocytic rate of IgM þ cells for 1 m m beads was signi ﬁ cantly reduced ( P < . 05 ) in the presence of IPA - 3 , NSC23766 , M - b - CD , and nystatin , but not in the presence of CPZ or dynasore ( Fig . 4 ; Fig . S1 ) . The uptake of 1 m m beads by IgM (cid:2) cells was signi ﬁ cantly reduced ( P < . 05 ) in the presence of CPZ , dynasore , M - b - CD , and nystatin but not in the presence of IPA - 3 or NSC23766 ( Fig . 4 ; Fig . S1 ) . 3 . 4 . Effect of endocytic inhibitors on the uptake of bacteria by IgM þ cells To determine the pathway of bacteria uptake in PBL , the cells were incubated with inactivated E . coli in the presence of various endocytic inhibitors . The FACS results indicated that the percentage of IgM þ cells ingesting E . coli was signi ﬁ cantly reduced ( P < . 05 ) in the presence of M - b - CD , nystatin , IPA - 3 , and NSC23766 , while the percentage of IgM (cid:2) phagocytic cells was signi ﬁ cantly reduced ( P < . 05 ) in the presence of CPZ , dynasore , M - b - CD , and nystatin ( Fig . 5 ; Fig . S2 ) . 3 . 5 . Macropinocytosis in IgM þ B cells during internalization of large particles Rhodamine - labeled high - molecular - mass dextran , an estab - lished marker of macropinocytosis , was used to con ﬁ rm the occurrence of macropinocytosis in IgM þ B cells . The result showed that IgM þ B cells displayed apparent dextran uptake ( Fig . S3 ) , which was inhibited by the presence of IPA - 3 or NSC23766 ( data not shown ) . The co - localization assay showed that when PBL were incubated with rhodamine - labeled dextran and 1 m m yellow green beads , both dextran and microsphere beads were detected in IgM þ cells ( Fig . 6 ) . 4 . Discussion Previous studies showed that endocytic IgM þ B cells exist in teleost ﬁ sh such as rainbow trout , Atlantic salmon , Atlantic cod , lump ﬁ sh , and half - smooth tongue sole ( Ghebretnsae et al . , 2015 ; Li et al . , 2006 ; Øverland et al . , 2010 ; Yang et al . , 2017 ) . Similar morphological characteristics and endocytic ability of turbot IgM þ B cells have been clearly demonstrated in our present study through ﬂ ow cytometry and microscopy analysis . However , approximately 10 % of turbot IgM þ B cells in PBL were capable to ingest 1 m m beads , which was particular lower in comparison to the IgM þ B cells from other teleost species , such as in rainbow trout ( 55 % ) , in Atlantic salmon ( 36 % ) , ; in half - smooth tongue sole ( 21 % ) and in Atlantic cod ( 19 % ) . This difference in ingestion capability by IgM þ cells implies a different function for IgM þ cells as non - professional phagocytes in different teleost ﬁ sh species . Addition - ally , such difference may be due to the ﬁ sh status as well as the experimental conditions varied in one laboratory from the other . Moreover , the uptake ef ﬁ ciency strictly depended on the size of the beads , with the highest ef ﬁ ciency being observed with 0 . 5 m m beads , and the ef ﬁ ciency dropping as the size of the beads increased . Although the endocytic activity of IgM þ B cells was discovered in teleost and amphibians more than ten years ago ( Li et al . , 2006 ) , the relevant internalization pathways have not been fully clari ﬁ ed ( Li et al . , 2006 ; Øverland et al . , 2010 ; Yang et al . , 2017 ; Zhu et al . , 2014 ) . Endocytosis by eukaryotic cells serves a variety of house - keeping and specialized cellular functions , and can be mediated by distinct molecular pathways including clathrin - coated pits , lipid raft / caveolin - mediated endocytosis , macropinocytosis and phago - cytosis ( Ivanov , 2008 ) . In mammals , mature B cells have been found to bind speci ﬁ c antigen through a unique and restricted B cell re - ceptor ( BCR ) and internalize ligand - receptor complexes via a clathrin - dependent pathway ( Malhotra et al . , 2009 ; Vidard et al . , 1996 ) . However , Raji B cells ( derived from Burkitt lymphoma ) engulfed non - speci ﬁ c bacteria through macropinocytosis ( García - P (cid:1) erez et al . , 2012 ) . Pharmacological inhibitors are often used to investigate which endocytic mechanisms are responsible for cellular uptake of particles ( Ivanov , 2008 ; Iversen et al . , 2011 ) . In the current study , we found that the number of endocytic IgM þ B cells in response to 0 . 5 m m beads was signi ﬁ cantly reduced in the presence of macropinocytosis inhibitors ( IPA - 3 and NSC23766 ) ; in contrast , the inhibitors of clathrin ( CPZ and dynasore ) and caveolin ( M - b - CD and nystatin ) signi ﬁ cantly decreased the uptake of 0 . 5 m m beads by IgM (cid:2) cells . These results indicate that for the uptake of 0 . 5 m m beads , macropinocytosis is important for IgM þ B cells , while clathrin - and caveolin - dependent endocytosis are important for IgM (cid:2) cells . Four inhibitors against macropinocytosis and caveolin pathways signi ﬁ cantly decreased the endocytosis of 1 m m beads by IgM þ cells . Of these inhibitors , IPA - 3 and NSC23766 ( against mac - ropinocytosis ) induced much higher levels of inhibition than M - b - CD and nystatin ( targeting caveolin ) , suggesting that Fig . 5 . Effect of endocytic inhibitors on the uptake of bacteria by IgM þ and IgM (cid:2) cells . Peripheral blood leukocytes ( PBL ) were incubated with Escherichia coli and treated with anti - IgM mAb and PE - labeled secondary antibody in the presence or absence ( control ) of CPZ , M - b - CD , IPA - 3 . Bacterial uptake was then determined by ﬂ ow cytometry . Data are representatives of 9 individual ﬁ sh from three independent ex - periments . * * P < . 01 . Y . - q . Li et al . / Developmental and Comparative Immunology 82 ( 2018 ) 31 e 38 36 macropinocytosis was vital to IgM þ cells endocytosis , while caveolin - mediated pathway provided a relatively moderate contribution . The uptake of 1 m m beads by IgM (cid:2) cells was clathrin - and caveolin - dependent , which is similar to that of the uptake of 0 . 5 m m beads . Based on these observations , we can propose that the internalization of large particles by turbot IgM þ B cells is mainly dependent on macropinocytosis . The different endocytosis pathway in mammalian B cells and turbot IgM þ B cells may be due to the different roles they play in the immune responses . High - molecular - mass dextran is an established marker for macropinocytosis and has been applied to the detection of mac - ropinocytosis ( Commisso et al . , 2013 ; Dharmawardhane et al . , 2000 ) . In our study , we found that a high level of rhodamine - labeled dextran was observed in IgM þ B cells . This was signi ﬁ - cantly decreased when the macropinocytosis inhibitors IPA - 3 and NSC23766 were present , indicating that turbot IgM þ cells could ingest dextran through macropinocytosis . Furthermore , the ﬂ uo - rescent beads ingested by IgM þ B cells were co - localized with dextran , suggesting that the uptake of large particles by B cells was executed via macropinocytosis . In addition to latex beads , we also investigated the uptake of inactivated bacteria by turbot IgM þ B cells . We found that the amount of IgM þ B cells that ingested inactivated E . coli was signi ﬁ cantly reduced by treatment with macropinocytosis and caveolin inhibitors , but not by clathrin inhibitors , suggesting that macropinocytosis and caveolin - mediated endocytosis are impor - tant for the internalization of E . coli . In contrast , in IgM (cid:2) cells , the inhibitors of clathrin and caveolin signi ﬁ cantly decreased the up - take of E . coli , indicating that IgM (cid:2) cells internalized E . coli via clathrin - and caveolin - dependent endocytosis . It is likely that the similar internalization pathways for E . coli and 1 m m beads employed by IgM þ cells is due to the similarity in the size of E . coli and the beads . In conclusion , we demonstrated for the ﬁ rst time that the par - ticle uptake capability of turbot IgM þ B cells varies with particle size , the latter affecting not only the uptake ef ﬁ ciency but also the choice of the internalization process . It is apparent that the endo - cytosis pathways of IgM þ B cells differ from that of IgM (cid:2) cells and mainly depend on macropinocytosis . These results provide new insights into the endocytosis mechanism of B cells in teleost ﬁ sh .
