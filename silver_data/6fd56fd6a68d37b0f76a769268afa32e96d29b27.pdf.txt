Dynamin2 mutants impair the formation of actin comets , which are induced by Listeria monocytogenes or phosphatidylinositol - 4 - phosphate 5 - kinase . However , the role of dynamin2 in the regulation of the actin comet is still unclear . Here we show that aberrant actin comets in dynamin2 - depleted cells were rescued by disrupting of microtubule networks . Depletion of dynamin2 , but not cortactin , significantly reduced the length and the speed of actin comets induced by Listeria . This implies that dynamin2 may regulate the actin comet in a cortactin - independent manner . As dynamin regulates microtubules , we investigated whether perturbation of microtubules would rescue actin comet formation in dynamin2 - depleted cells . Treatment with taxol or colchicine created a microtubule - free space in the cytoplasm , and made no difference between control and dynamin2 siRNA cells . This suggests that the alteration of microtubules by dynamin2 depletion reduced the length and the speed of the actin comet . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 3 Introduction Dynamin GTPase plays an essential role in vesicle formation during endocytosis [ 1 ] . Dynamin oligomerizes around the neck of the clathrin coat pit , and its GTPase activity is required for fission of the constricted membrane to produce endocytic vesicles . Dynamin has three isoforms in mammals . Dynamin1 is specifically expressed in the brain , dynamin2 is ubiquitously expressed , and dynamin3 is expressed in neurons and testes [ 2 , 3 ] . All dynamin isoforms have five domains — the N - terminal GTPase domain , middle domain , pleckstrin homology domain , GTPase effector domain , and C - terminal proline rich domain ( PRD ) . The GTPase domain plays a role in the hydrolysis of GTP . PRD connects with other SH3 domain - containing proteins , such as amphiphysin , intersectin , and cortactin [ 4 , 5 ] . Recently , it has been suggested that dynamin interacts with cortactin to regulate actin assembly [ 6 ] . Cortactin binds F - actin and induces an actin meshwork by activating the Arp2 / 3 complex [ 7 ] . The interaction between dynamin and cortactin plays a key role in the membrane deformation involved in cell motility , endocytic vesicle formation , and propulsive force [ 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 ] . Dynamin was originally identified as a specific microtubule - binding GTPase [ 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 ] . Recent research has shown that a dynamin2 mutant , which was 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 4 found in a neuropathy , induces the accumulation of stable microtubules [ 18 ] . Thus , dynamin has multiple functions other than endocytic fission . Dynamin2 and cortactin localize in the actin comet induced by Listeria or PIP5K overexpression , and dynamin2 mutants ( K44A , D208N , and ΔPRD ) perturb actin comet formation [ 19 , 20 ] . However , another study showed that cortactin is not essential for actin comet formation [ 21 ] . Several bacteria ( Listeria and Shigella ) and viruses recruit and activate the Arp2 / 3 complex in host cells to produce an actin comet [ 22 ] . After entering the host cell , Listeria can escape from the endosome using listeriolysin O . Once in the cytosol , Listeria induces nucleation and assembly of the host cell actin filaments . This can generate substantial force , pushing these pathogens forward through the cytoplasm [ 23 ] . To induce actin nucleation , Listeria expresses a surface protein , ActA , which directly binds to and activates the ARP2 / 3 complex . After escaping from the endosome , Listeria is surrounded by actin ( actin cloud ) . Then , an actin comet is created on the side of the bacterium , producing motile force that moves the bacterium rapidly through the host cell . This allows the spread of bacteria from cell to cell [ 23 ] . Although dynamin2 was found in the actin comet , its significance remains to be elucidated . In this study , we investigated the role of endogenous dynamin2 in the regulation of the actin comet . Dynamin2 depletion , but not cortactin , reduced 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 5 the length and the speed of actin comets . We found that microtubules are essential to the differences between control and dynamin2 - depleted cells . These results indicate that the alteration ( such as increased stability ) of microtubules by dynamin2 depletion may be responsible for the reduction of the length of the actin comet . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 6 Results Dynamin2 and cortactin were differentially recruited to actin comet To confirm localization of endogenous dynamin2 and cortactin in the actin comet , HeLa cells were infected with Listeria for 1 h and then placed in bacteria - free medium for 5 h before fixing . The HeLa cells were immunolabeled for F - actin and dynamin2 or cortactin . As shown in Fig . 1A , endogenous dynamin2 was detected only in the actin comet tail , but not in actin clouds . In contrast , endogenous cortactin was detected in both actin comet tails and actin clouds ( Fig . 1B ) . Thus , dynamin2 and cortactin were differentially recruited to actin clouds and actin comet tails , suggesting that they may play distinct roles on actin comets . Dynamin2 siRNA reduced the length of actin comet tail Next , we analyzed the role of endogenous dynamin2 and cortactin using siRNA . HeLa cells were transfected with specific siRNAs , infected by Listeria , fixed , and processed for immunofluorescence procedures . As shown in Figs . 2A and B , we found that the length of the actin comet tail was reduced in dynamin2 siRNA cells ( 18 . 4 ± 5 . 8μm in control cells , 8 . 2 ± 2 . 5μm and 9 . 3 ± 3 . 9μm in dynamin2 siRNA cells ; n = 20 , P < 0 . 001 ) . This was observed with two different dynamin2 - specific siRNAs , indicating that the reduction resulted from the lack 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 7 of dynamin2 . On the other hand , cortactin siRNA cells showed no significant reduction in the comet length . These results support those of a previous report , which showed that cortactin does not play any significant role in actin comet formation [ 21 ] . These results clearly indicate that dynamin , but not cortactin , plays an indispensable role in actin comet formation . Dynamin2 siRNA reduced actin comet formation We found that dynamin2 siRNA , but not cortactin siRNA , reduced the length of the actin comet tail . To investigate whether the reduction also affected the motility of the intracellular pathogen , we used live cell imaging to observe the dynamics of actin comet formation . Cells stably expressing GFP - actin were transfected with control or dynamin2 siRNA and imaged by time - lapse microscopy after Listeria infection . As shown in supplementary movies 1 and 2 , the speed of Listeria movement was significantly decreased in dynamin2 siRNA cells . Quantitative analysis ( Fig . 2C ) also showed a significant reduction in the speed of Listeria movement ( 16 . 7 ± 4 . 2 in control cells , 9 . 5 ± 3 . 0 and 10 . 4 ± 3 . 0 in dynamin2 knock down cells ; n = 20 , P < 0 . 001 ) . These results indicate that dynamin2 depletion reduced both the comet tail length and speed of Listeria movement . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 8 Perturbation of microtubules rescued the effect of dynamin2 siRNA As cortactin depletion had no significant effect on the actin comet , dynamin2 probably regulates the actin comet in a cortactin - independent manner . Microtubules are considered to act as a barrier to the actin comet of bacterial pathogens [ 24 ] . We recently found that dynamin2 regulates the dynamic instability of microtubules , and depletion of dynamin2 induces the accumulation of acetylated tubulin , a marker of stable microtubules ( Fig . 3A ) [ 18 ] . Thus , the accumulation of stable microtubules by dynamin2 depletion might form a strong barrier against bacterial pathogens , resulting in the inhibition of actin comet formation ( Fig . 3B ) . To investigate whether microtubule perturbation rescues the reduction in actin comet formation induced by dynamin2 siRNA , we treated Listeria - infected cells with microtubule - perturbing reagents . As the microtubule depolymerizing reagent nocodazole dramatically reduces the infectivity of bacteria , we used taxol to create a space for bacteria in the cytoplasm by aggregating microtubules . Infected cells were treated with taxol for 5 h , fixed , and processed for immunofluorescence procedures ( Fig . 3C ) . In taxol - treated cells , microtubules showed abnormal polymerization and microtubule - free spaces were observed . Thus , the taxol treatment appeared to be useful for creating a microtubule - free space . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 9 Next , we investigated whether actin comet formation in dynamin2 siRNA cells was affected by the taxol treatment . As shown in Fig . 3D , the length of the comet tail was increased by the taxol treatment in both control and dynamin2 siRNA cells , and no significant differences were observed between these siRNA cells ( Fig . 3E ) . Further , we used live cell imaging of GFP - actin to observe the speed of Listeria movement . Consistent with the immunofluorescence experiment , we found that Listeria was faster in dynamin2 siRNA cells treated with taxol than in untreated dynamin2 siRNA cells ( see supplementary movie S1 - 4 ) . Quantitative analysis also showed that the speed of Listeria movement in dynamin2 - depleted cells was comparable to that in control cells ( Fig . 3F ) . Similar experimetns were performed by using colchicine , a microtubules depolymerizing drug ( Fig . 4 ) . Colchicine inhibited microtubule polymerization in both control and dynamin2 siRNA cells ( Fig . 4A ) , and elongated the actin comets in dynamin2 siRNA cells ( Fig . 4B and C ) . Thus , microtubules appear to be responsible for the reduction of the comet tail length in dynamin2 siRNA cells . Previous studies have shown that the expression of dynamin2 K44A ( a dominant - negative mutant ) reduced the length and the speed of PIP5K - induced actin comet [ 19 , 20 ] . As dynamin2 K44A has no effect on the dynamic instability of microtubules , we investigated the effect on Listeria - induced actin 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 10 comet . Interestingly , when dynamin2 K44A was introduced , no significant difference in the actin comet length was observed ( Fig . 5A ) . The mutant effectively inhibited the endocytosis of transferrin ( the internalized transferrin was not detected in 0 . 05 % and 93 % of WT and K44A - expressing cells , respectively ) , indicating that the expression level was sufficient to inhibit endogenous dynamin2 . Moreover , taxol treatment was also elongated the actin comet even on dynamin2 K44A expressing cells ( Fig . 5B ) . These results indicate that the reduction of the length and the speed of Listeria - induced actin comet in dynamin2 - depleted cells could result , at least in part , from the state of microtubules . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 11 Discussion Here we investigated the role of dynamin2 and cortactin in actin comets . Both dynamin2 and cortactin localized in the actin comet tail , but cortactin also localized in the actin cloud . These proteins seem to play a distinct role in actin comet formation . To investigate the role of dynamin2 and cortactin in the actin comet , we depleted endogenous protein using siRNA . Cortactin depletion had no significant effect on the length of the actin comet , as previously reported [ 21 ] , but dynamin2 depletion significantly reduced both the comet tail length and speed of Listeria movement . As dynamin2 regulates actin polymerization via cortactin [ 9 ] , it is possible that dynamin2 regulates the actin comet in an cortactin / actin - independent manner . A recent finding indicates that dynamin2 directly binds the actin filaments and may regulates its organization [ 25 ] . This suggests that dynamin2 may regulate the actin polymerization of the actin comet in cortactin - independent manner . Whereas , dynamin2 regulates the dynamic instability of microtubules , and we investigated in this study whether microtubules are responsible for the aberrant actin comet induced by the depletion of dynamin2 . The cytoplasm of a cell is a dense , organized , tightly regulated structure [ 24 ] . Microtubules are considered to act as a barrier to the actin comet . Shigella uses 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 12 the protease VirA , which is secreted by the bacteria itself , to destroy microtubules in host cells , thus facilitating its movement [ 26 ] . In the case of Listeria , the bacterium recruits stathmin , a microtubule - sequestering protein of the host cell , to destabilize microtubules , thus allowing bacterial movement in the cytoplasm [ 27 ] . On the other hand , we have found that dynamin2 depletion increases the stability of microtubules [ 18 ] . Therefore , it is possible that the accumulation of stable microtubules , which was induced by dynamin2 siRNA , reduced the comet tail length and speed of Listeria movement . Interestingly , no significant difference between control and dynamin2 siRNA cells was observed in taxol - treated cells . Although both dynamin2 depletion and taxol treatment resulted in microtubule stabilization , opposite effect on actin comet formation was acquired . In dynamin2 siRNA cells , dynamic instability of microtubules was reduced , but overall structure of microtubule network was unaffected . On the other hand , taxol prevents only microtubule depolymerization and induces the accumulation of microtubule bundles . This resulted in making a free space for Listeria movement in taxol treated cells , but not in dynamin2 siRNA cells . As Listeria recruits stathmin , which inhibits microtubule polymerization or depolymerization [ 27 ] , it is possible that the stathmin in dynamin2 - depleted cells could not create free space to allow Listeria movement , and as a consequence , the speed of Listeria movement was decreased ( a hypothetical 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 13 model is illustrated in Fig . 6 ) . Another possibility is that microtubules itself regulates actin polymerization by a signaling connection . Microtubule disassembly promotes the formation of actin stress fibers [ 28 ] . Drug , which disrupts microtubules , induces rapid assembly of actin filaments and focal adhesion [ 29 ] , whereas microtubule stabilization with taxol attenuates these effects . Moreover , regulation of the actin filaments by microtubules requires Rho GTPases [ 30 ] and possibly dynamin [ 25 ] . It needs further investigation to uncover the molecular mechanism between the actin comet and microtubules , including the alteration of microtubule network and the signaling connections . Previous reports show that several dynamin2 mutants , including K44A ( dominant negative ) , D208N ( reduced affinity for GTP ) , and ΔPRD ( interaction with SH3 - containing proteins , including cortactin ) influence the morphology and motility of the actin comet [ 19 , 20 ] . Of these , the first two mutants localize in the actin comet tail and their expression reduces the comet tail length . However , our present study showed that dynamin2 seems not to have a direct role on the actin filament of Listeria - induced actin comet . This implies that these mutants might induce abnormal actin rearrangement in the actin comet tail by overexpression of exogenous proteins . ΔPRD does not localize in the actin comet tail , but its expression reduces the comet tail length . One possibility is that PRD interacts with microtubules , and ΔPRD ma y affect the dynamic 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 14 instability of microtubules , which indirectly influences on actin comet formation . Second possibility is that dynamin plays as an enzyme , which controls actin dynamics at actin comet , and dynamin2 directly regulates actin rearrangement in the actin comet or through other SH3 - containing proteins . Interestingly , a recent report has shown that dynamin regulates actin polymerization through direct dynamin - actin interactions [ 25 ] . In this study , we could not exclude the possibility that dynamin regulates directly the actin polymerization . At least in part , however , microtubules contribute dynamin - dependent actin comet formation induced by Listeria . Based on the finding that cortactin also regulates actin polymerization and localizes on actin comet , but has no significant role on the length and the speed of actin comet , dynamin and / or cortactin may adjust actin bundle for efficient propulsion . Hence , further detailed analysis is required to fully understand the regulation of the actin comet by dynamin and cortactin . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 15 Acknowledgments We thank Dr .
