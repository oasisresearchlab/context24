Abstract ( 240 words ) 27 Background : School closures have been used as a core Non pharmaceutical intervention 28 during the COVID - 19 pandemic , however the role of educational settings in COVID - 19 29 transmission is still unclear . 30 Methods : This systematic literature review assessed studies published between December 31 2019 and April 1 , 2021 in Medline and Embase , which included studies that assessed 32 educational settings from approximately January 2020 to January 2021 . The inclusion 33 criteria were based on the PCC framework ( P - Population , C - Concept , C - Context ) . The study 34 Population was restricted to people 1 - 17 years old ( excluding neonatal transmission ) , the 35 Concept was to assess child - to - child and child - to - adult transmission , while the Context was 36 to assess specifically educational setting transmission clusters . 37 Results : Fifteen studies met inclusion criteria , ranging from daycare centers to high schools 38 and summer camps , while eight studies assessed the re - opening of schools in the 2020 - 2021 39 school year . In principle although there is sufficient evidence that children can both be 40 infected by and transmit SARS - CoV - 2 in school settings , the SAR remain relatively low - when 41 NPI measures are implemented in parallel . Moreover , although the evidence was limited 42 there was an indication that younger children may have a lower SAR than adolescents . 43 Conclusions : Transmission in educational settings in 2020 was minimal - when NPI measures 44 were implemented in parallel . However , with an upsurge of cases related to variants of 45 concern , continuous surveillance and assessment of the evidence is warranted to ensure the 46 maximum protection of the health of students and the educational workforce , while also 47 minimising the numerous negative impacts that school closures may have on children . 48 Strengths and limitations of this study 49 • This study provides a rapid review of the peer - reviewed literature pertaining to SARS - 50 CoV - 2 transmission by children within educational settings . 51 • The review reflects the status quo of the previous school years ( January 2020 - January 52 2021 ) due to the lag time between study implementation , peer review and publication . 53 • The included studies represent child - to - child transmission within the context of previous 54 SARS - CoV - 2 strains and are not directly applicable to newer variants . 55 .

Are they drivers of the 59 pandemic , or are they merely innocent bystanders , affected in myriad ways by school 60 closures and other physical distancing measures while not being generally at - risk of COVID - 61 19 themselves ? 62 Epidemiologic indicators of SARS - CoV - 2 infection in children provide a complex picture 63 regarding their potential role in the transmission chain . Systematic reviews have concluded 64 that children and adolescents have lower susceptibility to SARS - CoV - 2 infection [ 1 , 2 ] . 65 However , when infected and symptomatic , children may shed viral RNA in similar quantities 66 to adults [ 3 ] , and that younger children ( under 5 years ) with mild to moderate symptoms 67 may shed even more virus than older children and adults [ 4 ] . While the proportion of 68 asymptomatic SARS - CoV - 2 infections among children in the general population is uncertain , 69 initial data had indicated that 16 % of paediatric cases in Europe in the first phase of the 70 pandemic were classified as asymptomatic [ 5 ] , while up to 90 % of paediatric cases in China 71 were deemed to be asymptomatic , mild , or moderate [ 6 ] . Moreover , it is possible that 72 children are less often asymptomatic carriers than adults : a study of non - COVID - 19 - related 73 hospitalizations in Milan identified 1 % of children and 9 % of adults as asymptomatic carriers 74 of SARS - CoV - 2 [ 7 ] . Meanwhile , while children are overall noted to have lower rates of 75 severe COVID - 19 cases [ 8 ] , there is evidence of differing transmission dynamics between 76 younger vs . older children [ 2 ] . There is evidence that when index cases , younger children , 77 such as under 10 years of age , lead to lower secondary attack rates than older children and 78 adult [ 9 , 10 ] . 79 Important potential sources of evidence surrounding the role of children in the COVID - 19 80 pandemic come from studies situated in the community , household , healthcare or 81 educational settings . Transmission of SARS - COV - 2 has thus far been documented to be 82 higher in household settings than in other community settings – including schools – a finding 83 which may be potentially attributable to the individual , behavioural and contextual factors 84 of households vs . other settings , as has been suggested elsewhere [ 9 ] . 85 .

However , as 89 decisions currently need to be taken to ensure high levels of preparedness in school settings 90 [ 11 ] , the literature published thus far may have important insights to guide decision - making 91 around school closures and re - openings , as well support decision making for mitigation 92 measures in educational settings . This systematic literature review was conducted to assess 93 child - to - child and child - to - adult SARS - CoV - 2 transmission within educational settings and to 94 calculate where possible the secondary attack rate ( SAR ) when the child is the index case . 95 METHODS 96 Search Strategy 97 This systematic literature review is reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting 98 Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta - Analysis ( PRISMA ) guidelines [ 12 ] . Relevant studies 99 published between December 2019 and April 1 , 2021 were identified by searching Medline 100 and Embase . The following set of inclusion criteria were used to determine eligibility of the 101 studies , which is based on the PCC framework ( P - Population , C - Concept , C - Context ) . The 102 study Population was restricted to people 1 - 17 years old ( excluding neonatal transmission 103 [ 13 ] ) , the Concept was to assess child - to - child and child - to - adult transmission when the 104 child is the index case , while the Context was to assess specifically educational setting 105 transmission clusters . Subject heading terms and free text words relating to the Population , 106 Concept and Context terms as identified in the inclusion criteria were used to develop a 107 comprehensive list of terms for the search strategy , from which this specific review was 108 based . We included all studies of quantitative research , while , opinion pieces , 109 commentaries , case reports and editorials were excluded . Mathematical modelling and 110 simulation studies were also excluded . We additionally screened reference lists of the 111 included articles to identify further relevant studies . The search was limited to the English 112 language . 113 114 Study selection 115 .

As a high measure of inter - rater agreement was achieved between the two 118 reviewers during the pilot assessment ( percentage agreement > 90 % and / or Cohen’s Kappa 119 > 0 . 81 ) , the remaining titles were randomly allocated to the two reviewers and screened for 120 eligibility independently by them . After an initial selection of the titles , each reviewer 121 assessed each other’s selected studies . The retrieved articles were then independently 122 double - screened by two reviewers based on the full text of the articles . 123 Data extraction 124 The data extraction template was piloted independently by the two reviewers on a random 125 sample of two included studies to enable an assessment of consistency in data extraction 126 and to identify where amendments needed to be made to the template . The remaining 127 studies were then data extracted independently by two reviewers , and the results were 128 double checked across the original manuscript by a third reviewer . 129 Data synthesis 130 Characteristics of the included studies were presented in tabulated form detailing the study 131 design , geographical location of the study , sample size , characteristics of the populations 132 considered , setting , context , parallel implemented Non Pharmaceutical Interventions ( NPI ) , 133 and the findings of the study . Depending on the level of information available , infection SAR 134 were noted . A narrative synthesis approach was applied to look systematically at the data 135 and to describe each study categorized by the study design . Patterns in the data were 136 identified through tabulation of results , and an inductive approach was taken to translate 137 the data to identify areas of commonality between studies . 138 Patient and Public Involvement statement 139 Patients or the public were not involved in the design , or conduct , or reporting , or 140 dissemination plans of our research . 141 RESULTS 142 Study selection and description 143 .

After the removal of duplicates , 5 , 233 were screened by 145 title / abstract , out of which 333 were assessed via full text , and 15 studies subsequently 146 included in this review . The PRISMA flowchart showing the flow of study selection is 147 presented in Figure 1 . 148 Fifteen published studies were identified to address child - to - child and / or child - to - adult 149 transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 . Timeframes of data collection within these studies ranged 150 between January 2020 and January 2021 . Studies from 11 countries were included ( United 151 States , South Korea , Israel , Germany , Italy , Ireland , France , Singapore , Australia , Norway , 152 and England ) . A full detailed overview of the published studies is provided in Table 1 . 153 Studies assessing outbreaks in Educational Settings 154 Heavey et al . [ 14 ] conducted a case study in order to explore the role of transmission among 155 children in the school setting in the Republic of Ireland , before school closure . Three 156 pediatric index cases of COVID - 19 with a history of school attendance were detected with 157 895 contacts . Child - to - adult transmission or child - to - child transmission was not reported in 158 this study . Similarly Danis et al . [ 15 ] presented the contact tracing results of a nine - year - old 159 child in France , who visited 3 different schools the first days of symptom appearance . There 160 was no evidence of secondary transmission in any of the school contacts . Moreover , Yung et 161 al . traced three COVID - 19 cases ( 2 pediatric and 1 adult ) in three different educational 162 settings , and the results were negative , as were the tracing of close contacts of a preschool 163 case in S Korea [ 16 ] . Gold et al , in early 2020 had also indicated the possibility of educators 164 playing a role in school transmission as identified through the assessment of a transmission 165 cluster in primary ( elementary ) schools in the US [ 17 ] while Lopez et al assessed three 166 COVID - 19 outbreaks in child care facilities in Utah , during April 1 – July 10 , 2020 and noted 167 that SARS - CoV - 2 Infections among young children acquired in child care settings were 168 transmitted to their household members [ 18 ] . 169 One study from New South Wales , Australia presented an overview of COVID - 19 cases and 170 transmission in schools . In a total number of 15 schools and 10 Early Childhood Educational 171 and Care Settings , 27 index cases were identified , among which 12 were children and 15 172 staff members . Secondary transmission was noted only in four out of 25 educational 173 .

A school 177 outbreak in Israel after reopening of schools in May 2020 was described by Stein - Zamir et al . 178 The outbreak assessment was initiated by two pediatric COVID - 19 cases that were not 179 epidemiologically related . The results showed that 153 / 1161 students and 25 / 151 staff 180 members tested positive for COVID - 19 . However , this outbreak was attributed to crowded 181 classes , combined with the exemption of facemasks and the use of air - condition due to an 182 extreme heatwave [ 20 ] . On the contrary , a study by Link - Gelles et al . , in Rhode Island , USA . 183 among 666 child care programs that reopened on 1 June , 2020 after a 3 - month closure 184 revealed 52 confirmed and probable cases ( 33 confirmed cases ) , of which 30 were among 185 children and 22 among adults . Secondary transmission for 10 cases was noted in only 4 / 666 186 childcare programs , which was attributed to class distancing , the use of face masks for 187 adults , universal symptom screening daily and disinfection [ 21 ] . The regional reopening of 188 schools in Germany in May 2020 was assessed by Ehrhardt et al . , who noted that child - to - 189 child transmission in schools / childcare facilities appeared very uncommon , with an 190 estimated six of the identified 137 cases that had attended school to have led to a 191 secondary transmission overall to 11 additional pupils [ 22 ] . While two additional studies 192 from S Korea by Yoon et al . , indicated that upon the return of children to school in May - June 193 2020 , no indication of secondary transmission was noted in kindergarten children , middle 194 school or high schools , while in primary school only two cases of secondary transmission 195 was noted [ 23 , 24 ] . The reopening of schools in September 2020 in Italy was not associated 196 with elevated SAR , which reached 3 . 8 % overall , 0 % in preschool , 0 . 38 % in primary and 197 6 . 46 % in secondary schools , however these percentages included both adult and child cases 198 [ 25 ] . Brandal et al . , assessed the transmission of COVID - 19 in school settings in Norway 199 between August - November 2020 and identified minimal child - to - child ( 0 . 9 % , 2 / 234 ) and 200 child - to - adult ( 1 . 7 % , 1 / 58 ) transmission [ 26 ] . 201 Summer educational camps are presented separately , as close proximity between students 202 is not only noted within school hours but throughout the day and night due to additional 203 extra curriculum activities and close sleeping proximity . Two studies assessed secondary 204 .

Pray et al 205 identified a rapid transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 at an overnight retreat where adolescents and 206 young adults aged 14 – 24 years had prolonged contact and shared sleeping quarters , where 207 one index case / child led to the infection of 76 % of attendees [ 27 ] . On the contrary Blaisdell 208 in four overnight camps noted no indication of secondary transmission following the 209 isolation of the paediatric index case and quarantine of their cohort , indicating the 210 importance of the implementation of NPI to reduce COVID - 19 transmission [ 28 ] . 211 Secondary attack rates of COVID - 19 transmission in educational settings 212 Table 2 presents the SAR extracted from the studies , ranging from 0 to 76 % , depending on 213 the setting , the timeframe and the implementation of NPI . With the exception of the study 214 by Pray et al . , [ 27 ] within the context of summer camps in which a high transmission rate 215 ( 76 % ) was noted , in all studies within the context of school settings , the reported SARs were 216 minimal . Age differentiations were noted , for instance in the study by Larosa et al . , across 217 36 schools in northern Italy , who identified an overall SAR of 3 . 2 % , reaching 6 . 6 % in middle 218 and high schools and 0 . 38 % in primary schools . 219 DISCUSSION 220 This study provides a rapid review of the peer - reviewed literature pertaining to SARS - CoV - 2 221 transmission by children within educational settings , a topic which is a crucial input to 222 assessments of the role of school settings in COVID - 19 transmission . The literature 223 appraised in this review provides sufficient evidence that children can both be infected by 224 and transmit SARS - CoV - 2 in school settings , however the SAR remained relatively low within 225 the studies assessed by our review , reflecting primarily schools in 2020 . Our results with 226 regards to educational settings are in line with population based studies published after the 227 cut - off of this review , in which SARS - CoV - 2 outbreaks were uncommon in educational 228 settings [ 29 ] in England [ 30 ] , Canada [ 31 ] and in Utah , [ 32 ] , Missouri [ 33 ] and New Jersey , 229 USA [ 34 ] , during similar periods . 230 During the first waves of the COVID - 19 pandemic , the vast uncertainty surrounding the 231 epidemiology of SARS - CoV - 2 led many countries globally to include school closure 232 concomitant with other NPIs for reducing COVID - 19 transmission . Within our review there 233 were limited cases in the assessed studies in which a child index case was responsible for 234 .

This finding 238 is supported by data from a large population based study assessing transmission dynamics 239 that identified that patterns of enhanced transmission risk in similar age pairs were 240 strongest among children aged 0 to 14 years [ 2 ] . 241 On the contrary , evidence from studies that note a very small number of cases after school 242 reopenings the authors attribute to the strict NPIs implemented including the use of face 243 masks , physical distancing , screening for symptoms and classroom disinfection . Close 244 proximity between students was linked to elevated transmission rates in both school 245 settings and educational camps [ 20 , 27 ] , while adult educators have also been noted to play 246 a role in school transmission [ 17 ] . 247 Modelling studies using various assumptions of infectivity from the first 3 - 4 months of the 248 pandemic [ 35 - 41 ] , have previously assessed the role of school closure , and overall indicated 249 that school closure is associated with a reduction in the number of cases , hospitalisations 250 and ICU admissions , with the effect of school closure dependent on the transmission rate , 251 and the duration of school closure . Within this context age is noted to be a crucial aspect , as 252 recent modelling studies from the Netherlands indicated that contact restrictions within the 253 age group of 10 - 20 years old caused a slightly more significant reduction in Re compared to 254 5 - 10 years old [ 54 ] . The same study also assessed the impact of reducing school contacts in 255 pandemic progression and showed that if complete school closure were implemented after 256 the summer holidays , R would be reduced by 10 % , however , if school closure was enacted 257 in November , after implementing a partial lockdown since August , it could further decrease 258 R by 16 % . Another recent European study that assessed school closure , based on the 259 population of two large cities of Norway , Oslo and Tromso , indicating that a controlled and 260 gradual school re - opening would only have a slight increase in the reproduction number of 261 less than 0 . 25 , and probably in the range between 0 . 10 and 0 . 14 , which would not 262 substantially affect the infection rates [ 55 ] . 263 While school closure may reduce SARS - CoV - 2 transmission as noted above , the societal and 264 economic impacts of prolonged school closure are noteworthy , as they may impact the 265 .

Furthermore , the impact of 268 school closures has been noted to impact significantly also special education [ 44 ] , while 269 research performed within the context of the COVID - 19 pandemic has identified that 270 contextual factors of particular relevance during school closures had negative impacts on 271 student wellbeing [ 45 ] . In light of the above , policy makers need to be aware of the 272 cost / benefit in each setting when considering school closures as a NPI [ 46 ] . 273 Transmission of SARS - COV - 2 has been noted to be higher in household settings than other 274 community settings , including schools , a finding which may be potentially attributable to the 275 individual , behavioural and contextual factors of the household vs . other settings , which 276 may support transmission dynamics [ 47 ] . Direct evidence showing children as a source of 277 transmission is scarce and largely based on small studies or studies investigating few 278 paediatric cases , however the results presented here concur with other and previous 279 systematic reviews that have summarised the evidence on the role of children in SARS - CoV - 280 2 transmission [ 48 - 50 ] . 281 There are important limitations to this study that may impact the direct implications for 282 decision - making . As we assessed peer - reviewed evidence published in two biomedical 283 databases , it inherently reflects the status quo of the interim of the previous school years 284 ( January 2020 - January 2021 ) due to the lag time between study implementation , peer 285 review and publication . A further limitation of this report refers to the fact that these 286 studies represent child - to - child transmission within the context of previous SARS - CoV - 2 287 strains and are not directly applicable to newer and more transmissible variants , such as the 288 SARS - CoV - 2 Delta ( B . 1 . 617 . 2 ) variant of concern . Finally , the included studies reflect a broad 289 geographical and temporal range and are limited in comparability due to varying factors 290 such as : background levels of community SARS - CoV - 2 transmission ; enrolment strategies 291 and varying NPI policies which in turn depends highly on the geographical region and the 292 socioeconomic context , while accountability to government and political stability were 293 found to exert influence [ 51 ] . Hence in light of the above , supporting educators and parents 294 in the implementation of NPIs is important as population based studies have indicated that 295 .
