Scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) 31 revealed that the fibers presented irregular and rough surfaces , with a grooved and heavily 32 striated morphology distributed throughout the structure . Dynamic mechanical analysis ( DMA ) 33 showed that , with the exception of elongation at break , the incorporation of chitosan into the 34 fibers improved their tensile properties . The invitro release profile of sulfathiazoleas a function 35 of chitosan’s molecular weight indicated that the fibers are viable carriers of drugs . Kinetic 36 models showed that the release of the model drug is first - order , and the release mechanism is 37 governed by the Korsmeyer - Peppasmodel . Likewise , fibers loaded with sulfathiazole showed 38 excellent inhibition of Escherichia coli growth after an incubation time of 24 hours at 37°C . 39 40 41 42 3 43 44 45 46 47 48 Keywords : Alginate , Chitosan , Polyelectrolyte Complex , Mechanical Properties , In - vitro 49 Release Models 50 51 4 1 . Introduction 52 In recent years , due to the search for green chemistry and environmentally - friendly materials , 53 there has been a reemergence of interest in the use of polysaccharides as a source of polymeric 54 materials ( Poulsen , 1996 ) . This renaissance in the chemistry of polysaccharides materials is 55 supported by their useful propertiesincluding non - toxicity , biocompatibility , biodegradability , 56 and water solubility ; making these compounds suitable for different applications . Several 57 polysaccharides , including starch , pectin , cellulose , chitin , and chitosan , have found potential 58 uses in the pharmaceutical and biomedical fields ( Munarin , Tanzi , & Petrini , 2012 ; Alvez & 59 Mano , 2008 ; Torres , Troncoso , Grande , & Diaz , 2011 ) . The direct beneficial effects of these 60 biopolymers on human health lie in their successful use in designing and developing drug 61 delivery systems , acting as inert diluents for drugs , serving as wound dressing and scaffolds for 62 tissue engineering , as well as many other applications ( Silva et al . , 2014 ; Lee & Kim , 2011 ; Luo , 63 Zhang , Xiaong , & Wan ; 2014 ) . 64 65 Amongst many natural and biocompatible polysaccharides , it is important to highlight the 66 potential use of the alginatesin the biomedical field . Being a family of unbranched copolymers , 67 alginates consist of ( 1 - 4 ) linked β - D - mannuronic acid and α - L - guluronic acid residues of varying 68 composition and sequence . Both structural units contain carboxylic functionalities which confer 69 an electronegative nature to these polymers in aqueous media . Another biopolymer with 70 considerable biomedical interestis chitosan . Chemically , chitosan is a linear polymer , considered 71 to be more versatile than chitin due to the presence of reactive amino groups at the C - 2 positions . 72 These amino groups are responsible for chitosan’s polycationic nature in aqueous media . 73 5 Due to chitosan’s polycationic nature and alginate’s polyanionic nature in aqueous solution , the 74 two charged polymers are able to spontaneously form polyelectrolyte complexes ( PECs ) when 75 they are mixed ( Kim etal . , 1999 ) . PECs are formed when macromolecules of opposite charge are 76 allowed to interact . The formation of polyelectrolyte complexes is mainly driven by an 77 electrostatic mechanism , where charge neutralization induces attraction between separated 78 segments of the polyelectrolytes ; even though hydrogen bonding , ion - dipole forces and van der 79 Waals interactions frequently play a significant role in determining the assemble of the ultimate 80 structures ( Verma & Pradesh , 2013 ) . In terms of thermodynamics , the entropy gain associated 81 with the release of counter ions is one of the major driven forces for PEC formation 82 ( Dautzenberg , 2001 ) . Complexes of different characteristics can be obtained by changing 83 thechemical characteristics of the constituent polymers ( Sankalia M . , Mashru , Sankalia 84 J . , & Sutariya , 2007 ) . The field of application of PECs is vast and it has been well supported by a 85 large number of publications ; including membranes for medical use ( Wan et al . , 2008 ; Haisch , 86 2000 ) , microcapsules ( Yi & Sukhorukov , 2014 , ) beads ( Du , Dai , Liu , & Danovich , 2006 ) , fibers 87 ( Liao , Wan , Yim , & Leong , 2005 ; Watthanaphanit et al . , 2009 ; Steplewski , Wawro , 88 Niekraszewicz , & Ciechańska , 2006 ) , films ( Yamanlar , Sant , Boudou , & Picart , 2011 ) , hydrogels 89 ( Raghothaman et al . , 2014 ) , binding of pharmaceutical products ( Verma & Pradesh , 2013 ) , and 90 many others . 91 92 Several scientists have looked into combining polyanionic alginate with polycationic chitosan in 93 order to assemble PECs . Alginate is one of the most interesting anionic polyelectrolytes to be 94 complexed with chitosan , because the material formed between these two polymers is still 95 biodegradable , but mechanically stronger at lower pH values where chitosan dissolves 96 6 ( Hamman , 2010 ) . As stated by Sæther et al . ( 2008 ) , aqueous solutions of alginate and chitosan 97 having pH values of ~ 6 . 5 and ~ 4 . 0 , respectively , ensured that both compounds are fully ionized ; 98 maximizing the electrostatic interactions and therefore the assemble of the polyelectrolyte 99 complex and its final properties . 100 101 The mechanism behind the PEC formation using alginate / chitosan mixtures mainly lies in the 102 electrostatic interactions between the negatively charged carboxylic acid groups of manuronic 103 and guluronic acid units in alginate , with the positively charged amino groups of chitosan in 104 aqueous solution . Polyelectrolyte complexes may be formed from alginate and chitosan using 105 different methods , andseveral reports about the preparation of fibersfrom these two biopolymers 106 can be found in the literature . These fibers can be biocompatible and non - toxic , factors making 107 them ideal for in vivo applications . They can also exhibit bioactivity , biodegradability and 108 hemostatic properties ( Knill et al . , 2004 ) . Chang , Lee , Wu , Yang , & Chien ( 2012 ) , were able to 109 complex alginate / chitosan to produce core - sheath fibersusing the electrospinning technique . 110 However , alginate fibers were commonly prepared by injecting an aqueous solution of alginate 111 into a gelling bath containing an acidic solution or calcium salt ( Ca + 2 ) solution to coagulate the 112 fibers . After that , the chitosan is commonly used to coat calcium alginate filaments . According to 113 Knill et al . ( 2004 ) , these agents might induce the precipitation of chitosan due to charge 114 neutralization ; leading to very low levels of incorporation of this biopolymer into the fibers 115 ( Miraftab , Qiao , Kennedy , Anand , & Groocock , 2003 ; Jeong et al . , 2011 ; Taqieddin & Amiji , 116 2004 ) . 117 118 7 In this study , the complexation process was carried out without the use of a gelling solution 119 composed of inorganic ions , such as calcium salt . The fibers were produced by a direct wet 120 spinning process , where the alginate aqueous solution was slowly pumped into a chitosan bath , 121 the gelling solution , using simple and low cost experimental equipment . Therefore , by taking 122 advantage of the beneficial and outstanding physicochemical properties previously mentioned , 123 this work reportsthe major aspects related to the preparation and characterization of fibers , 124 produced through wet spinning of alginate solution into a chitosan coagulation bath . The 125 chemical , physical , and mechanical properties of these new fibers were investigated as a function 126 of the chitosan’s molecular weight and retention time , which is the time that the fibers are 127 allowed to remain in the chitosan coagulation bath after spinning the alginate solution . Contrary 128 to previous investigations , in which their mechanical behavior is not extensively covered , in this 129 paper , tensile properties of the filaments are analyzed with the objective of providing study of 130 their laboratory performance . In addition , sulfathiazole ( a model antimicrobial agent ) was 131 incorporated into the fibers , and the drug release mechanism was completely characterized for 132 potential pharmaceutical and biomedical applications . 133 134 2 . Experimental 135 2 . 1 Materials 136 For this study there were two sources of chitosan . Commercial chitosan ( M W ~ 150 kDa ) was 137 purchased from Fluka Chemical Company ( US ) . The degree of deacetylation was ≥ 75 . 0 % , 138 moisture ≤ 10 % , ash content ≤ 2 % , insoluble matter ≤ 1 % , and viscosity ~ 100 mPa . s ( 1 . 0 % in 139 1 % acetic acid ) . Chitosan ( M W ~ 79 kDa ) was supplied by the Laboratory of Science and 140 Technology of Polymers , Costa Rica . The degree of deacetylation was ~ 68 . 5 % , moisture ~ 10 . 6 141 8 % , ash content ~ 0 . 20 % , and viscosity ~ 18 . 9mPa . s ( 1 . 0 % in 1 % acetic acid ) . Sodium alginate 142 was purchased from VWR ( US ) and used as received . The molecular weight was 450 to 550 143 kDa , sulfated ash content 30 . 0 % to 36 . 0 % , and viscosity 350 to 550 mPa . s ( 1 % , Brookfiled 144 LV , 20 ° C ) . The model drug used in this research was sulfathiazole ( C 9 H 9 N 3 O 2 S 2 , purity > 99 % ) , 145 acquired from Alfa Aesar ( US ) and used as received . This drug was selected due to its stability 146 under acidic conditions , as well as its UV - visible absorbance at 280 nanometers . Anhydrous 147 sodium acetate ( C 2 H 3 NaO 2 , purity > 99 % ) was purchased from Fisher Chemicals ( US ) and used 148 as received . Other materials included reagent grade glacial acetic acid and hydrochloric acid . 149 150 2 . 2 Methods 151 2 . 2 . 1 Reduction of Chitosan’s Molecular Weight through Sonication 152 In order to vary the molecular weight of the commercial chitosan , a sonicator was used . 153 Chitosan / acetic acid solution was placed in an ice bath and then put into the sonicator . The 154 sonicator was set at 40 % amplitude for 40 minutes with 30 seconds on and then 30 seconds off . 155 This mixture was hand - stirred approximately every 10 minutes to ensure homogenous 156 sonication . 157 158 2 . 2 . 2 Determination of Chitosan’s Molecular Weight 159 After sonication , dilute solution viscometry was used to determine the new molecular weight of 160 the chitosan samples . AnUbbelohde viscometer was used for this purpose . The viscometer was 161 placed into an approximately 12 L water bath which was kept at 25 o C and stirred by a 162 submersible stirrer / water heater . A series of five standards , at varying concentrations of chitosan , 163 were made and analyzed on the viscometer . For each standard , 10 measurements were made . The 164 9 solvent used was an acetic acid / sodium acetate buffer ( 0 . 3 M acetic acid , 0 . 2 M sodium acetate ) . 165 This data was then plotted on a Huggins - Kraemer Plot . The molecular weight was determined 166 using the Mark - Houwinkequation , employing α = 0 . 76 and K = 8 . 2 x 10 - 2 mL / g as stated by 167 Rinaudo ( 2006 ) . 168 169 2 . 2 . 3 Fiber Preparation throughWet Spinning Process 170 One percent ( w / v ) alginate aqueous solution was loaded into a syringe with a 30 G Precision 171 Glide Needle with an inner diameter of 0 . 29 millimeters . The alginate solutionwas spun into a 172 petri dish with approximately 50 mL of chitosan using a Fisher Scientific single syringe pump , 173 which was set at an extrusion rate of 75 mL / hour . The alginate solution gelled upon contact with 174 the chitosan / acetic acid solution . The dish was spun by hand to prevent the alginate from 175 clumping up . The fibers were then allowed to sit in the chitosan bath for varying amounts of 176 time . Pure alginate fibers were also produced by wet spinning technique . The alginate aqueous 177 solution was spun into a coagulating bath containing 0 . 2 M HCl to afford the corresponding 178 alginic acid fibers . After the appropriate retention time , the fibers were taken out of the bath with 179 tweezers and submerged into approximately 100 mL of distilled water for approximately 20 180 seconds . After this wash , the fibers were strung up , in approximately 10 cm segments , to dry in a 181 convection oven set at 30 o C , for 24 hours . 182 183 2 . 2 . 4 Preparation of Drug Loaded Fibers 184 In order to load the model drug into the fibers , an aqueous solution of alginate / sulfathiazole was 185 prepared . The solution was made by dissolving 1g of sodium alginate and 1 g of sulfathiazole in 186 100mL of deionized water . This suspension was vigorously stirred for 24 hours . Due to its high 187 10 viscosity , the solution was warmed to 40 o C before the wet spinning process . Wet spinning was 188 performed as stated in above . 189 2 . 3 Characterization 190 2 . 3 . 1 Determination of chitosan ` s content of alginate - chitosan fibers . 191 The chitosan ` s content of the fibers was determined by analyzing the nitrogen content ( on a 192 weight percentage basis ) using elemental analysis . 5 mg of alginate / chitosan fibers prepared with 193 36 kDa chitosan at 1 h , 24 h , and 48 h retention time , were freeze dried and sent to Atlantic 194 Microlab , Inc . The chitosan wt % , based on the nitrogen content , was calculated following the 195 method described by Sweeny et al . ( 2014 ) . 196 197 2 . 3 . 2 Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy ( FTIR ) 198 With the aim to study the chemical interaction between the alginate and chitosan , FTIR was 199 performed . Infrared spectra of the starting materials and alginate / chitosan blends were measured 200 by attenuated total reflection ( ATR ) method using a Thermo Nicolet 6700 Fourier transform 201 infrared spectrometer connected to a PC with OMNIC software analysis . All spectra were 202 recorded between 400 and 4000 cm - 1 over 64 scans with a resolutions of 16 cm - 1 . 203 204 2 . 3 . 3 Scanning Electron Microscopy ( SEM ) 205 SEM study was performed with the purpose of obtaining a topological characterization of the 206 fibers . After coagulation in the chitosan gelling solution , the fibers were taken out of the bath and 207 washed with distilled water . After this wash , the fibers were strung up and dried in a convection 208 oven ( set at 30 o C ) for 24 hours . The dried fibers were stored at 25 ° C and 65 % R . H . for 24 hours 209 prior to the SEM study . The fractured surfaces of pre - chilled fibers in liquid nitrogen were 210 11 studied by scanning electron microscope ( SEM , Cambridge 360 ) . Samples were sputtered with 211 gold prior to SEM observations . 212 2 . 3 . 4 Determination of Fiber Diameter by Optical Microscope 213 To determine the diameter of the fibers , a Spencer Optical Microscope ( American Optical 214 Company , US ) was used . Five random locationson the fiber surface were chosen and measured . 215 These values were then averaged to determine the cylindrical geometry of the fibers . All data are 216 expressed as means ± standard deviations . Statistical analysis was performed by one - way 217 analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) in conjunction with Tukey ` s post hoc test for multiple 218 comparisons using Minitab 17 software . 219 220 2 . 3 . 5 Determination of Mechanical Properties 221 In order to test the tensile properties of the fibers , a TA Instruments RSA3 DMA was used . After 222 coagulation in the chitosan gelling solution , the fibers were taken out of the bath and washed 223 with distilled water . After this wash , the fibers were strung up and dried in a convection oven 224 ( set at 30 o C ) for 24 hours . The dried fibers were stored at 25 ° C and 65 % R . H . for 24 hours prior 225 to the tensile testing . All the tested specimens were treated and stored under similar conditions , 226 and their tensile properties were evaluated with the degree of hydration provided by these drying 227 conditions . No further examination of their water content or moisture was performed . For the 228 tensile study , 10 millimeter segments of fiber were placed into the instrument . Anchors made of 229 Scotch Tape were attached to the fiber to ensure that the stress , and not the clamps , broke the 230 fibers . The instrument was set at an extension rate of 0 . 05 millimeters / second . During tensile 231 testing , data was only used from fibers which broke in between the clamps . Any fiber that broke 232 inside the clamped area , or broke as a result of being next to the metallic surface , was not used . 233 12 Any fiber for which three runs were not successfully completed was discarded . From this data , 234 the Young’s modulus , yield strength , ultimate strength , and elongation at break were determined 235 as a function of chitosan’s molecular weight and retention time in the coagulation bath . Tensile 236 tests were performed according to the ASTM D1708 - 93 ( 1993 ) . All data are expressed as means 237 ± standard deviations . Statistical analysis was performed by one - way analysis of variance 238 ( ANOVA ) in conjunction with Tukey ` s post hoc test for multiple comparisons using Minitab 17 239 software . 240 241 2 . 3 . 6 InVitro Drug Release Study 242 With the objective of quantifying the amount of released drug as a function of time , an invitro 243 drug release study was performed . A series of standards of sulfathiazole diluted in deionized 244 water were prepared . Using a Shimadzu UV - Visible Spectrophotometer ( UV - 2450 ) , with a slit 245 width of 5 . 0 nm , absorbance at 37 o C was measured . From this data , a standard curve was made . 246 Approximately 7 milligrams of drug - loaded fibers ( spun at room temperature and retained in a 247 chitosan bath for 1 hour ) were placed into a 100mL volumetric flask . This was filled with deionized 248 water at 25 o C . This flask was then heated to 37 o C in a water bath . At selected time intervals , 3 249 mL aliquots of the mixture were removed ( after mixing the solution with a micropipette ) . For 250 each aliquot collected , a 3mL aliquot of deionized water was used to replace the lost solution . In 251 this way , the volume of the solution was kept constant . 252 253 2 . 3 . 7 Drug Release Kinetic Studies 254 In order to study the kinetics and mechanism of drug release , the results of the invitro test were 255 fitted into different kinetic equations ( Dash , Murthy , Nath , & Chowdhury , 2010 ) , such as zero 256 13 order ( cumulative percent drug released vs time ) , first order ( log cumulative percent of drug 257 retained vs time ) , Higuchi [ cumulative percent of drug released vs ( time ) 1 / 2 ] , Hixson - Crowell’s 258 cube root model [ ( cumulative percent of drug retained ) 1 / 3 vs time ] and Korsmeyer - Peppas ( log of 259 cumulative percent of drug released vs log of time ) . The model that best fits the invitro data was 260 evaluated by comparing the regression coefficients ( r 2 ) . The equations of different release 261 kinetics are detailed as follows ( Sahoo , Chakraborti , & Behera , 2012 ) . 262 263 - Zero order model 264 (cid:1843) (cid:3047) = (cid:1843) (cid:2868) + (cid:1837) (cid:2868) (cid:1872) ( 1 ) 265 Where Q t is the amount of drug dissolved in time t , Q 0 is the initial amount of drug in the solution 266 ( most times Q 0 = 0 ) , and K 0 is the release constant . 267 268 - First order model 269 log (cid:1843) (cid:3047) = (cid:1864)(cid:1867)(cid:1859) (cid:1843) (cid:2868) − (cid:3012) (cid:3117) (cid:2930) (cid:2870) . (cid:2871)(cid:2868)(cid:2871) ( 2 ) 270 Where Q t is the amount of drug dissolved at time t , Q 0 is the initial amount of drug in the solution , 271 and K 1 is the first order release constant . 272 273 - Higuchi model 274 (cid:1843) (cid:3047) = (cid:1837) (cid:3009) (cid:1872) (cid:2869) / (cid:2870) ( 3 ) 275 Where Q t is the amount of drug dissolved at time t and K H is the release constant . 276 277 - Hixson - Cromwell model 278 (cid:1849) (cid:2868)(cid:2869) / (cid:2871) − (cid:1849) (cid:3047)(cid:2869) / (cid:2871) = (cid:1837) (cid:3046) (cid:1872) ( 4 ) 279 14 Where W 0 is the initial amount of drug in the pharmaceutical dosage form , W t is the remaining 280 amount of drug in the pharmaceutical dosage form at time t , and K s is a constant incorporating 281 the surface - volume relation . Diving equation ( 4 ) by W o1 / 3 and simplifying : 282 ( 1 − (cid:1858) (cid:3047) ) (cid:2869) / (cid:2871) = 1 − (cid:1837) (cid:3009)(cid:3004) (cid:1872) ( 5 ) 283 Where f t = 1 – ( W t / W o ) , f t represents the amount of drug dissolved at a time t , and K HC is the 284 release constant . 285 286 - Korsmeyer - Peppasmodel 287 (cid:3018) (cid:3295) (cid:3018) (cid:3116) = (cid:1837) (cid:3012)(cid:3017) (cid:1872) (cid:3041) ( 6 ) 288 Where Q t / Q 0 is the fraction of drug released at time t , K KP is the release constant , and n is the 289 release exponent , indicative of the drug mechanism . A detailed interpretation of the release 290 exponent is shown in Table 1 . 291 292 Table 1 .

This was then incubated overnight with shaking at 37°C . 302 Then , 100 µl of E . coli culture was spread onto 3 replicate LB agar plates . Each plate was labeled 303 with three different locations for samples ( A , B , C ) . Fibers A and B were loaded with 1wt % 304 sulfathiazole and fiber C ( without drug ) served as a control . Fiber A was prepared with 150 kDa 305 chitosan . Fibers B and C were made with 79 kDa chitosan . All fibers were spun with a 30 G 306 needle and were coagulated in a chitosan bath for 1 hour . The plates were then incubated for 24 307 hours at 37°C , and bacterial growth around the fibers was observed . 308 309 3 . Results and Discussion 310 3 . 1 Determination of chitosan ` s content of alginate - chitosan fibers . 311 The total nitrogen analysis was performed on chitosan – alginate fibers ( fibers prepared with 36 312 kDa chitosan ) to determine their nitrogen content so as to determine the percentage by weight of 313 chitosan in the chitosan - alginate fibers . The initial hypothesis was that longer retention times 314 would encourage greater incorporation of the chitosan into and onto the alginate fibers ; so the 315 elemental analysis was carried out to confirm if there is an increase in the chitosan content . As 316 shown in Table 2 , the amount of chitosan incorporatedinto the fibers was low , ranging from 2 . 96 317 to 7 . 61wt % for the tested specimens . The results obtained from the total nitrogen analysis 318 revealed that there is an increase of around 2 . 5 times in the chitosan content of the fibers , when 319 the time that the fibers were allowed to remain in the coagulation bath was increased from 1 to 320 16 48 hours . With longer retention times in the coagulation bath , chitosan was ableto penetrate more 321 into the gelled alginate fibers . The amount of chitosan incorporated into the fibers agrees with 322 the reported literature ( Knill et al . , 2004 ) . 323 324 Table 2 . Chitosan content of the fibers as a function of the retention time a . 325 Average Component Content ( wt % ) Retention time of the fibers ( hours ) 1 24 48 Nitrogen 0 . 21 ± 0 . 07 0 . 37 ± 0 . 06 0 . 54 ± 0 . 06 Chitosan 2 . 96 ± 0 . 90 5 . 21 ± 0 . 80 7 . 61 ± 0 . 80 a Fibers prepared with 36 kDa chitosan . 326 327 3 . 2 Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy ( FTIR ) 328 Due to the light weight and small diameter of the fibers , a blend of alginate - chitosan ( 50 / 50 329 wt % ) was prepared by solvent casting technique and used as a model to have a more reliable 330 study the interaction between these two biopolymers . Figure 1 shows the resulting FTIR spectra 331 of chitosan ( 1 ) , sodium alginate ( 2 ) , and the alginate - chitosan blend ( 3 ) . Chitosan , an amino 332 glucose biopolymer , showed a weak band of C - H stretching at around 2876 cm - 1 . The absorption 333 band for the carbonyl stretching of the secondary amide was found at 1639 cm - 1 , while the 334 bending vibration band of the N - H group appeared at around 1548 cm - 1 . The peaks at 1407 and 335 1325 cm - 1 respectively belong to the amide and N - H stretching . Sodium alginate showed the 336 following distinct peaks as a carboxyl salt : strong absorption bands at 1591 and 1405 cm - 1 due to 337 carboxyl anions ( asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations ) . The spectra of the pure 338 components are consistent with those reported in the literature ( Fan et al . , 2006 ) . In the case of 339 the alginate - chitosan blend ; the spectrum is dominated by the characteristic absorption peaks of 340 17 alginate , which suggests that the blend is mainly composed of this biopolymer . This finding is 341 supported by the total nitrogen analysis , which established that chitosan was incorporated in low 342 quantities into the fibers . 343 344 345 Figure 1 . FTIR spectra of chitosan ( 1 ) , sodium alginate ( 2 ) , and alginate - chitosan 50 / 50 wt % 346 blend ( 3 ) 347 3 . 3 Scanning Electron Microscopy ( SEM ) 348 In this work , alginate - chitosan fibers were produced using a wet spinning technique . Alginate 349 solution was coagulated in a chitosan bath at the three different chitosan’s molecular weights 350 ( using a fixed retention time of 24 hours ) and retention times ( using a fixed 36 kDa 351 chitosan ) . After coagulation in the chitosan gelling solution , the fibers were taken out of the bath 352 and washed with distilled water . After this wash , the fibers were strung up and dried in a 353 convection oven ( set at 30 o C ) for 24 hours . The dried fibers were stored at 25 ° C and 65 % R . H . 354 18 for 24 hours prior to the SEM study . Figures 2 and 3 show scanning electron micrographs of 355 alginate - chitosan fibers concerning the influence of three different chitosan’s molecular weights 356 ( low , medium , and high ) and three variable retention times , respectively . 357 358 Figure 2 . Scanning electron micrographs of alginate - chitosan fibers prepared using low ( A ) , 359 medium ( B ) , and high ( C ) molecular weight chitosan . Fibers retainedfor 24 hours in chitosan 360 bath . 361 362 Figure3 . Scanning electron micrographs of alginate - chitosan fibers ( prepared with 36 kDa 363 chitosan ) coagulated during 1 h ( A ) , 24 h ( B ) , and 48 h ( C ) . 364 365 As a general trend , it can be observed that the fibers presented irregular and rough surfaces , with 366 a grooved andheavily striated morphology distributed throughout the structure . From the 367 images , it is clearly seen that the change in both variables affected the morphology of the 368 19 fibers . Figure 2 revealed that the fibers containing low and medium molecular weight chitosan 369 exhibited a heavily rugged structure , whereas fibers containing high molecular weight chitosan 370 showed a smoother and considerably less rugged surface morphology . It has been established 371 that the structure formation of polyelectrolytes is determined by a fast initial process ( dependent 372 on both the concentration as well as the molecular weight of the polyelectrolytes ) and a 373 subsequent slower stage in which chains redistribute to a PEC conformation closer to 374 equilibrium ( Verma & Pradesh , 2013 ) . During coagulation , where complexation occurs , the 375 interactions between alginate and low and medium molecular weight chitosan led to 376 macromolecular rearrangements that resulted in fibers with more irregular structures . It has also 377 been shown that the formation of polyelectrolyte complexes is strongly dependent on electrical 378 parameters such as the degree of ionization of polymers , the density of charges , and its 379 distribution over the polymer chain ( Verma & Pradesh , 2013 ) . With the increase in the chitosan’s 380 molecular weight , there is also an increase in the number of positive charged amino groups , 381 pending from the backbone of the chitosan molecules . This increase in the charge density may 382 have induced stronger associations between the linear chains of these polymers , leading to more 383 fibrillar and less porous structures . In the case of the effect of retention time ( Figure3 ) , SEM 384 images revealed a more rugged or porous structure morphology with increasing time . Possibly , 385 due to molecular rearrangements during gelation , mainly driven by electrostatic interactions , the 386 incorporation of more chitosan changed the way the alginate matrix coagulated , leading to fibers 387 with highly porous surfaces . Besides these observations , no evidence of aggregation on the 388 fibers’ surface was noticed . 389 390 391 20 392 3 . 4 Determination of Diameter by Optical Microscope 393 In order to perform the mechanical testing of the fibers , it was necessary to evaluate their 394 cylindrical geometry . As shown in Figure 4 , the diameter of the fibers was significantly affected 395 by the presence of chitosan . According to the statistical analysis of the results , there is significant 396 variation in the diameters when incorporing this biopolymer into the fibers ( P < 0 . 05 ) . The 397 results also revealed that the fibers greatly grew in sizewith increasing chitosan molecular 398 weight . However , Tukey ` s test indicated that the data evaluating the influence of the molecular 399 weight can be classified into three groups of observations , showing significally different 400 means . Statistical evidence supports that the fibers with the largest diameters , corresponding to 401 one of groups , were ones obtained using chitosan with a molecular weight of 150 kDa . Likewise , 402 statistical treatment of the data also confirmed that the fibers made out of pure alginate ( second 403 group ) showed the shortest diameters . The fibers made using 79kDa and 36 kDa , presented 404 diameters in between the 150 kDa fibers and the pure alginate fibers ; nevertheless , there is no 405 statistical evidence to support that there ` s a significant difference in the variation of the diameter 406 when using either 36 kDa or 79 kDa chitosan ( therefore they correspond to the third 407 group ) . Chitosan has a rigid , stereo - regular structure containing voluminous pyranose rings . As 408 larger chitosan molecules interacted with the alginate , the structure of the polyelectrolyte 409 complex was affected by conformational changes , leading to bulkier structures due to the 410 macromoleculesassembled to the polymer chains forming the polyelectrolyte complex . 411 412 413 414 21 415 416 417 418 419 420 421 422 423 Figure 4 . Diameters of alginate - chitosan fibers with varying molecular weights ( fibers 424 retainedfor 24 hours in chitosan bath ) . 425 426 Another key variable in this study was the retention time of the alginate fiber in the chitosan 427 bath . The hypothesis was that longer retention times would encourage greater incorporation of 428 the chitosan into and onto the alginate fiber . Figure 5 shows the diameter of the fibers vs the 429 retention time . The analysis statistical analysis of the data revealed that there is a 430 significantincrease in the diameters of the fiberswhen lengthening the retention time ( P < 0 . 05 ) ; 431 however the magnitude of this effect seemed to be not very deep . Even though the Tukey ` s test 432 indicated that the data evaluating the influence of the retention time can be classified into four 433 groups of observations ( showing significally different means ) , it was observed that the diameters 434 are very close at 1 , 3 , 24 hours , with a slight uptick at 48 hours . From a practical perspective , it 435 can be concluded that the fibers with the largest diameters were the ones retained in the 436 0 0 . 01 0 . 02 0 . 03 0 . 04 0 . 05 0 . 06 0 . 07 0 . 08 150 kDa 79 kDa 36 kDa Alginate D i a m t e t e r ( mm ) 22 coagulation bath for 48 hours ; and that retention times of 1 , 3 , and 24 hours did not greatly 437 impact the diameter of the fibers . 438 439 440 441 442 443 444 445 446 447 Figure 5 . Diameters of alginate - chitosan fibers with varying retention times ( fibers prepared with 448 36 kDa chitosan ) . 449 450 3 . 5 Determination of Mechanical Properties 451 Regarding the mechanical characterization of the fibers , the four main tensile properties were 452 studied as a function of both the chitosan’s molecular weight and retention time . These tensile 453 properties included the Young’s modulus , yield strength , ultimate strength , and elongation at 454 break . After coagulation and washing , the fibers were dried in a convection oven ( set at 30 o C ) for 455 24 hours . The dried fibers were stored at 25 ° C and 65 % R . H . for 24 hours prior to the tensile 456 testing . All the tested specimens were treated and stored under similar conditions , and their 457 tensile properties were evaluatedwith the degree of hydration provided by these drying 458 conditions . No further examination of their water content or moisture was performed . 459 0 0 . 01 0 . 02 0 . 03 0 . 04 0 . 05 0 . 06 0 . 07 0 . 08 1 hour 3 hours 24 hours 48 hours D i a m e t e r ( mm ) 23 460 461 3 . 5 . 1 Effect of Chitosan’s Molecular Weight on Mechanical Properties 462 Table 3 shows the effect of varying molecular weights of chitosan on the fiber’s tensile 463 properties , retained in chitosan coagulation bath ( retention time ) for 24 hours . 464 465 Table 3 .

The fibers spun with 470 pure alginate and coagulated in a 0 . 2 M HCl bath were able to withstand signifcantly lower 471 amounts of stress than any of the fibers coagulated with chitosan . The Young ` s modulus was the 472 least impacted mechanical property . According to the statistical analysis of the results , there is 473 significant variation in the Young ` s modulus values when incorporing chitosan into the fibers ( P 474 < 0 . 05 ) . However , Tukey ` s test indicated that the data can be classified into two groups of 475 observations , having means that are significally different . There is a statisticalevidence to 476 support that there is an improvement in this property when using 150 kDa ( first group of 477 observations ) , compared to the pure alginate fibers ( second group of observations ) . Nevertheless , 478 24 there is no evidence to support that there ` s a significant difference in the value of this property 479 when using either 36 kDa or 79 kDa chitosan . In the case of elongation at break , significant 480 difference was observed when incorporing chitosan into the fibers ( P < 0 . 05 ) . Likewise , Tukey ` s 481 test indicated that there is a significant difference when varying chitosan ` s molecular weigth , and 482 the resulting data can be classified into three significally different groups of observations . The 483 fibers with the ability to elongate the most before breaking ( conforming one group ) , were the 484 fibers composed of pure alginate as well as fibers made with 79 kDa chitosan . Fibers made using 485 chitosan of 36 kDa conform the group with the lowest ability to withstand elogantion without 486 breaking . Fibers prepared using 150 kDa comprise another group of intermediate behavior , when 487 compared to the other two previous classifications . Regarding the influence of chitosan ` s 488 molecular weight on the yield strength and the ultimate strength , the analysis revealed that there 489 is statistical evidence to affirm that the incorporation of chitosan into the fibers improved the 490 values of these properties ( P < 0 . 05 ) . In both cases , the values were higher for the fibers 491 containing chitosan that the ones that lacked any chitosan . However , Tukey ` s test indicated that 492 there is no significant difference when varying the chitosan ` s molecular weight . 493 494 3 . 5 . 2 Effect of Retention Time on Mechanical Properties 495 Early in this research , it was hypothesized that the strongest fibers would be made utilizing the 496 smallest molecular weight of chitosan . At a lower molecular weight , the chitosan will be able to 497 more deeply incorporate itself into the fiber . Therefore , fibers prepared with 36 kDa 498 chitosanwere the subject of testing in this part of the study . Table 4 shows the effect of retention 499 time on the tensile properties of the fibers . Concerning the Young ` s modulus , the statistical 500 analysis revealed that the retention time has no effect on the magnitude of this parameter ( P < 501 25 0 . 05 ) . According to the grouping information provided by the Tukey method , all the observations 502 can be classified into one single category , indicating that the increase in the retention time has no 503 impact on the Young ` s modulus . Regarding the elongation at break , the results revealed that the 504 fibers made with 48 hour retention times are significantly different from the others ( P < 0 . 05 ) , 505 presenting nearly twice the elongation at break as other fibers . For this specific parameter , the 506 fibers made with 1 , 3 and 24 hours can be classified in one group ( statistically different from the 507 fibers at 48 hours ) , showing no significant difference between them , as suggested by the Tukey ` s 508 grouping method . In the case of the yield strength , the analysis supports that thefibers with the 24 509 hour retention time were able to carry more stress before plastic deformation ( P < 0 . 05 ) . The 510 fibers made with 1 , 3 and 48 hours can be classified in one category , showing no significant 511 difference between them , but significantly different from the ones obtained at 24 hours . With 512 respect to the evolution of the ultimate strength as a function of the retention time , the statistical 513 analysis revealed that the retention time has no effect on the values of this parameter ( P < 0 . 05 ) . 514 As in the case of the Young’s modulus , all the observations can be classified in one single 515 category , indicating that the increase in the retention time has no significant impact on the stress 516 needed to break the fibers . 517 518 Table 4 .

As can be seen in Figure 6 , all the 525 formulations showed a bi - phasic release pattern , suggesting that they all might follow the same 526 release mechanism . 527 528 529 530 531 532 533 534 535 536 537 Figure 6 . Drug release profile of alginate - chitosan fibers as a function of molecular weight ( the 538 fibers were spun at room temperature and retained in a chitosan bath for 1 hour ) . 539 540 This pattern is characterized by an initial period of fast release ( from zero time to approximately 541 1 hour of incubation ) , in which around 40 - 50 % of the drug loaded was released . After one hour , 542 the initial period of fast release is followed by a long period of slow release , where the release 543 rateis dramatically decreased and a cumulative release of around 50 % - 60 % is achieved by 6 544 27 hours . The fibers prepared with the lower molecular weight chitosan ( 36 kDa ) exhibited the 545 highest amount of sulfathiazole released after 6 hours of testing , while the ones containing 546 medium molecular weight chitosan ( 79 kDa ) showed the lowest values . Numerous research 547 groups , working with drug delivery systems of different morphologies , have also reported bi - 548 phasic patterns for the release of drugs from biopolymeric matrices ( Tiyaboonchai , 2003 ; Deng , 549 Zhou , & Lou , 2006 ; Cetin , Aktas , Vural , & Capan , 2007 ; Rafeeq , Junise , Saraswathi , & Dilip , 550 2010 ; Ma , Yeoh , & Lim , 2002 ) . It has been indicated that the initial release phase may be 551 associated with the dissolution of sulfathiazole crystals adsorbed onto the surface of the fibers . 552 During the initial incubation period , the sulfathiazole molecules are desorbed from the fiber’s 553 surface and rapidly diffuse into the dissolution medium . After this period of time , the release rate 554 falls abruptly , as is evidenced by the dramatic decrease in the slope of the profiles . At this point , 555 drug diffusion through the polymeric matrices becomes the dominant release mechanism . 556 Throughout incubation , the aqueous medium penetrates into the fibers due to the hydrophilic 557 nature of both chitosan and alginate . Sulfathiazole molecules , much smaller than either alginate 558 or chitosan , diffuse through the pores of the fibers into the dissolution medium . It is very 559 important to highlight that none of the systems released 100 % of the loaded drug within the time 560 tested . This partial drug release could be associated with the fact that sulfathiazole is an active 561 compound bearing ionizable amino functional groups in its structure . Under the acid conditions 562 of fibers formation in aqueous media , these groups can be protonated , generating charged drug 563 molecules able to interact ( through ionic bonding ) with the already charged polymer matrix , 564 affecting both the release rate as well as the amount of drug released to the dissolution medium . 565 566 28 The external morphology of the fibers ( defined by parameters such as dimension , external 567 porosity , and surface roughness ) , were studied by SEM as previously discussed . As suggested by 568 Donovan & Smyth ( 2010 ) , from a practical point of view , the surface area may be significantly 569 influenced by the extent of surface roughness . Given the fact that the fibers presented irregular 570 and rough surfaces , with a grooved and heavily striated morphology ; it can be inferred that they 571 also present a large surface area . Drug release begins when the polymer matrix - dissolution 572 medium fronts meetup ; creating an interphase in which mass exchange is possible , and the extent 573 of this interface is controlled by the magnitude of the surface area of the polymer matrix . 574 The mechanism by which drugs are released requires the dissolution of the drugs followed by 575 diffusion through the swelling porous structure to reach the release medium , and all these 576 phenomena occur at the interphase . The experimentally observed initial fast released of the drug , 577 known as burst effect , arises as a result of a large interphase ( product of the highly rough surface 578 of the fibers ) established between the matrix and the dissolution medium ; leading to the 579 dissolution and migration of sulfathiazole crystals adsorbed onto the surface of the fibers . After 580 this initial fast release , the slow release stage is reached . As a result of the large surface area , the 581 non - covalent interactions between therapeutic agent ( dispersed in the porous and rugged 582 structure of the fibers ) and the highly hydrophilic polymer matrixare maximized . This 583 phenomenon restricts the diffusion of the drug and therefore leads to a decrease in the release 584 rate . 585 586 3 . 7 Drug Release Kinetic Studies 587 In order to study the release rate of sulfathiazole from the fibers , the results of the invitro test 588 were fitted to the zero and first order models . The kinetic model that best fit the release of the 589 29 drug was evaluated by comparing the regression coefficient values ( r 2 ) obtained by regression 590 analysis of the dissolution data . Table 5 shows the obtained kinetic parameters for the drug - 591 loaded fibers as a function of chitosan’s molecular weight . The zero order model was plotted 592 using the obtained data ofcumulative percent of drug released ( Q t ) vs time , and first order was 593 plotted as log cumulative percentof drug retained ( 100 - Q t ) vs time . 594 595 As seen in the table , for both models , almost all the systems showed relatively good correlation 596 coefficients , ranging from 0 . 5502 to 0 . 9076 . Likewise , it can be observed that the kinetics 597 constants ( K 0 and K 1 ) decreased with the increase in the chitosan’s molecular weight . It is clear 598 that better correlation coefficients were obtained when fitting the data to the first order model . 599 This evidences that the release rate of sulfathiazole from alginate - chitosan fibers is dependent on 600 the concentration of the drug . 601 602 Table 5 .

The kinetic model that best fits the release of sulfathiazole was also evaluated 609 by comparing the r 2 values . The Higuchi model describes the drug release based on Fick’s 610 diffusion model and it establishes and proportionality relation between the fraction of released 611 drug and the square root of time . However , the Korsmeyer - Peppas model , is a semi - empirically 612 model exponentially relating the drug released to the elapsed time . The “ n ” values are used to 613 characterize different release mechanisms ( Table 1 ) . Likewise , the Hixson - Cromwell , recognizes 614 that the particle ` s regular area is proportional to the cube root of his volume . This model 615 describes the release form systems where there is a change in surface area and the diameter of 616 the particles . The data from the in vitro study were plotted for the Higuchi model as cumulative 617 percent of drug released ( Q t ) vs ( time ) 1 / 2 , forKorsmeyer - Peppasas log of cumulative percent of 618 fractional drug released ( Q t / Q o ) vs log of time , and for the Hixson - Crowell’s cube root model as 619 cubic root of the cumulative percent of drug retained ( 100 - f t ) vs time . The obtained linear 620 regression equations for the drug loaded fibers as a function of chitosan ` s molecular weight are 621 shown in Table 6 . 622 623 Table 6 .

It is also clear that better correlation coefficients were 629 obtained when fitting the data to the Kormeyer - Peppas model . This indicates that the mechanism 630 of sulfathiazole release from alginate - chitosan fibers seems to be governed by an exponential 631 relation , described by the Korsmeyer - Peppas model . Table 7 shows the resulting 632 kineticparameters for the fibers . 633 634 Table 7 . Kinetic Parameters for the Drug - Loaded Fibers as a Function of Chitosan ` s Molecular 635 Weight f . 636 Chitosan ` s Molecular Weight ( kDa ) Higuchi (cid:1843) (cid:3047) = (cid:2167) (cid:2164) (cid:1872) (cid:2869) / (cid:2870) Korsmeyer - Peppas log ( Q (cid:2930) / Q (cid:2868) ) = log ( (cid:2167) (cid:2167)(cid:2172) ) + (cid:2196) log ( (cid:1872) ) Hixson - Cromwell ( 1 − (cid:1858) (cid:3047) ) (cid:2869) / (cid:2871) = 1 − (cid:2167) (cid:2164)(cid:2159) (cid:1872) K H ( % h - 1 / 2 ) n K KP ( % h - n ) K HC ( % h - 1 ) 36 12 . 019 0 . 1688 45 . 603 0 . 0157 79 5 . 945 0 . 1175 38 . 637 0 . 0485 150 3 . 300 0 . 0461 49 . 091 0 . 0242 f Fibersretained in chitosan coagulation bath for 1 hour . 637 638 The parameter n presented the highest value ( n = 0 . 1688 ) when using chitosan having an average 639 molecular weight of 36 kD , and the lowest ( n = 0 . 0461 ) when using chitosan of 150 kDa . It is 640 very important to highlight that all the fibers exhibited n values less than 0 . 5 . Based on the 641 Korsmeyer - Peppas equation , this means that the mechanism of drug release for all the systems 642 could be described as a Pseudo - Fickian diffusion mechanism ( Sperling , 2001 ) . 643 32 644 The diffusion of particles through a polymeric matrix occurs in the solvent - filled domains 645 between the network chains . The mean free path length and residence time are quantities 646 strongly dependent on factors such as polymer chain mobility , size and functional groups of the 647 polymers , interactions between the permeant and the matrix , etc . ( Schmidt , Barmann , Isenberg , 648 & Sackmann , 1989 ) . Due to the increase in the chitosan ` s molecular weight , there is also an 649 increase in the number of hydrophilic functional groups ( amino , hydroxyl , and residual N - acetyl 650 units ) pending from the linear backbone of the chitosan molecules . As a result of the increase in 651 the number of these specific surface groups , the therapeutic agent is more retained by the highly 652 hydrophilic polymer matrix due to non - covalent interactions between the drug and the polymers . 653 This phenomenon creates a more hindered path through the polymeric network , in whichdrug 654 diffusion is more restricted , therefore slowing the diffusionrate from areas of high concentration 655 ( in the bulk polymer ) to low concentration ( the solvent molecules in the vicinity of the polymer 656 network ) . This fact is also supported by the decrease in the values of the kinetic constants for the 657 first order model , denoting a reduction in the release rate of sulfathiazole . The interactions 658 between chitosan matrices and hydrophilic drugs have been studied by several research groups 659 ( Puttipipatkhachorn , Nunthanid , Yamamoto , & Peck , 2001 ; Ma , Yeoh , & Lim , 2002 ; Wu , Yang , 660 Wang , Hu , & Fu , 2005 ) . 661 662 3 . 8 Growth Inhibition of E . coli 663 A preliminary qualitative efficacy test of bacterial growth inhibition was conducted by placing 664 fibers prepared with 150 kDa chitosan , loaded with 1 % sulfathiazole ( an antimicrobial drug ) , 665 onto an agar plate spread with an E . coli culture . Figure 7 ( where panel I is at time 0 and panel II 666 33 is after 24 hours of incubation ) shows a large area of bacterial growth inhibition around fibers A 667 & B ( loaded with the sulfathiazole drug ) after the 24 hr incubation . 668 669 670 671 Figure 7 . Efficacy of Drug - Loaded Fibers in inhibition of E . coli growth . Panel I is at time 0 , 672 while Panel II is after 24 hours of incubation . Fibers A ( 150 kDa ) and B ( 75 kDa ) are loaded 673 with sulfathiazole ( 1 wt % ) , and Fiber C ( 75 kDa ) is the control . Inhibition zones are evident 674 around Fibers A and B after 24 hours of incubation ( the areas inside the dashed area correspond 675 to the inhibition zones ) . 676 I II 34 Control fibers showed no apparent inhibition of E . coli . Chitosan is a biopolymer with proven 677 fungicidal and bactericidal activity ( Rabea , Badawy , Stevens , Smagghe , & Steurbaut , 2003 ; Liu 678 et al . , 2013 ; Mohamed , Clementine , Didier , Gérard , & Marie Noëlle , 2013 ) . According to the 679 literature ( Goy , Britto , & Assis , 2009 ) , three models , describing the antimicrobial potential of 680 chitosan , have been proposed ; the most acceptable being the interaction between positively 681 charged chitosan molecules and negatively charged microbial cell membranes . Literature 682 strongly emphasizes that higher positive charge confers stronger antibacterial activity to chitosan 683 ( Kong , Chen , Xing , & Park , 2010 ) . Since the formation of polyelectrolyte complexes is mainly 684 driven by an electrostatic mechanism , where charge neutralization induces attraction between 685 separated segments of the polyelectrolytes , there is a decrease in the positive charge density of 686 chitosan , leading to a decrease in its antibacterial activity , as reflected by the control fibers which 687 showed no inhibition of E . coli . The electrostatic interactions between the polycationic structure , 688 and the predominant anionic components of the microorganisms ` surface , play a primary role in 689 the antibacterial activity of chitosan . From this statement , it can be inferred that the antibacterial 690 activity is through inhibition contact . As in the case of the drug release studies , the irregular and 691 rough surfaces of the polymer matrices confer a large surface area to the fibers . The observed 692 bacterial growth inhibition arises as a result of a large interphase ( product of the large surface 693 area of the fibers ) established between the polymer matrix , in which the drug is mostly dispersed , 694 and the outer medium ( the E . coli . culture ) . Due to this large interphase , the interaction between 695 the sulfathiazole and the Escherichia Coli cultureis maximized , leading to a successful biocidal 696 activity . This test suggests that the resulting alginate - chitosan fibers , loaded with the 697 antimicrobial agent , have great potential for biomedical applications . 698 699 35 4 . Conclusions 700 Alginate - chitosan samples were produced by a wet extrusion technique . The prepared fibers 701 presented irregular and rough surfaces , with a grooved and heavily striated morphology 702 distributed throughout the structure . It is clearly seen that the change in both the chitosan’s 703 molecular weight and retention time affected the morphology of the fibers . The results of this 704 study also showed that , as a general trend and with the exception of elongation at break , the 705 incorporation of chitosan into the fibers improved their tensile properties . In addition , longer 706 retention times seemed to not greatly affect the mechanical performance of the fibers . 707 Preliminary invitro test results from the drug release profile showed that these fibers were able to 708 carry and release sulfathiazole under controlled conditions . Kinetic models showed that the 709 release of the model drug is first - orderand the release mechanism is governed by the Korsmeyer - 710 Peppas model , which comprises a mechanism combining drug diffusion and controlled swelling 711 of the polymer matrix . As shown by the bacterial inhibition test , the fibers also proved to be 712 capable of inhibiting the growth of E . coli during 24 hours of incubation . 713 714 Since the main goal of this research lies in developing fibers with potential applications in the 715 pharmaceutical and biomedical field , it is important to summarize that , after characterization , the 716 synthesized fibers comprise a biocompatible system with acceptable tensile properties , able to 717 provide a controlled release ( through diffusion and swelling ) of an biocidal agent capable of 718 inhibiting bacterial growth . Taking into account all these features , it is considered that these 719 fibers are suitable materials for designing and preparing biodegradable bandages , ideal for a 720 number of specific wound types . These dermal devices , due to the highly hydrophilic properties 721 of its components , could help to inhibit bodily fluids from flowing ( such as blood ) ; as well as 722 36 providing a moist wound environment necessary to facilitate wound healing . In addition , this 723 materials will form a barrier against bacteria , that my complicate healing due to inflections . 724 725 726 727 References 728 Alves , N . M . , & Mano , J . F . ( 2008 ) .
