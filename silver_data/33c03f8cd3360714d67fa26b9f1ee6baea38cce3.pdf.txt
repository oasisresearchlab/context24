The molecular machinery responsi - ble for protein trafficking is poorly understood in these apicomplexans . One of the most important proteins involved in clathrin - mediated protein trafficking is Epsin , which con - tains ENTH domain , a conserved domain crucial for mem - brane bending leading to vesicle formation . We undertook homology searching and phylogenetic analyses to produce a rigorously annotated set of Epsin homologs retrieved from diverse apicomplexan genomes . Genomic and phylogenetic comparisons revealed that apicomplexans contain unusual Epsin homologs that are distinct from those observed in mam - mals and yeast . Although there are four Epsin genes in mam - malian system and five in the yeast genome , apicomplexan parasites consist only a single Epsin gene . The apicomplexan Epsin contains the conserved ENTH domain consisting of phosphoinositide ( PtdIns ) - binding sites which indicate about their functional significance in the formation of vesicles ; how - ever , the absence of ubiquitin - interacting motif ( UIM ) sug - gests a possible different mechanism for protein trafficking . The existence of dileucine motif in Plasmodium , Cryptosporidum parvum and Eimeria tenella Epsins might solve their functionality while lacking a lot of conserved mo - tifs as this motif is known to interact with different adaptor protein complexes ( AP1 , AP2 and AP3 ) . Other Epsin homo - logs are also shown to have different peptide motifs reported for possible interaction with α - ear appendage , γ - ear append - age and EH domain present in different adaptors . Bioinformatic and phylogenetic analyses suggest that the apicomplexan Epsins have unusual functionality from that of the mammalian Epsins . This detailed study may greatly facil - itate future molecular cell biological investigation for the role of Epsins in these parasites . Keywords Epsin . Apicomplexan parasite . Protein trafficking .

Plasmodium ) , Piroplasmorida ( e . g . Theileria ) , Coccidia ( e . g . Toxoplasma ) , Gregarinasina ( e . g . Gregarina ) and Cryptosporidium , all of which are obligate parasites ( Adl et al . 2012 ) . Plasmodium is the most addressed parasite of this phylum for their parasitic mechanism causing malaria , a life - threatening disease that kills millions of people annu - ally ( Snow et al . 2005 ) . There are also a few other harmful parasites in this phylum including the following : Toxoplasma ( Toxoplasma gondii ) responsible for congeni - tal toxoplasmosis , Cryptosporidia ( Cryptosporidum parvum , Cryptosporidum hominis ) responsible for diar - rhoea , Babesia ( Babesia bovis ) responsible for Tick fever in cattle , Theileria ( Theileria parva ) responsible for theileriosis and Neospora ( Neospora caninum ) responsible for abortion in animals . These parasites are of enormous medical and economic importance due to their ability to infect humans and animals . Although some are zoonotic , the problem of them infecting animals is more to do with economic impact on farmers . Though many of the apicomplexan parasites have not been sequenced , database consisting of DNA sequence of some apicomplexan para - sites like PlasmoDB , GeneDB , UpathDB , PiroplasmaDB , ToxoDB , CryptoDB , etc . allowed us to retrieve and analyze important proteins of these organisms . In eukaryotic cells , protein trafficking is mediated by small single membrane vesicles from trans - Golgi network to the endosomal or lysosomal system and plasma mem - brane . The endocytic cargo molecules are packaged in these vesicles and bud from the donor compartments for carrying them to the acceptor compartments . The formation of ves - icles , recruitment of cargo proteins and fusion to the accep - tor compartment are highly regulated processes . The mo - lecular machinery involved in protein trafficking includes clathrin , adaptor protein complexes , ENTH domain - containing proteins ( Epsins ) , ADP ribosylation factors ( ARFs ) , SNARE , Dynamin and other accessory proteins ( Brodsky et al . 2001 ) . The apicomplexan parasites contain unique organelles known as apical complex structures that are responsible for invading into the host cells . They also contain food vacuole , endosomes and other sub - membrane vesicles ; all these organelles are potential targets to be in - volved in clathrin - mediated vesicular trafficking from / to trans - Golgi network . Epsin - like ENTH domain - containing protein is a family of conserved endocytic adaptors responsible for clathrin - mediated protein trafficking as well as endocytosis . Study about the structure and ligand binding site revealed that the ENTH domain is highly similar with AP180 N - terminal ho - mology ( ANTH ) domain , and both domains bind with inositol phospholipids and proteins . These bindings contribute to the nucleation and formation of clathrin coats on membranes for the development of membrane curvature through lipid remod - elling ( Legendre - Guillemin et al . 2004 ) . Epsin interacts with a group of proteins that are involved in the clathrin - mediated endocytosis , including clathrin , adaptor protein complex - 2 ( AP - 2 ) , Eps15 / intersectin , etc . ( Brodsky et al . 2001 ) . Epsins of animals and yeasts also interact with ubiquitin through their ubiquitin - interacting motif ( UIM ) ( Gabernet - Castello et al . 2009 ) . Epsins are well studied in yeast , mammalian and plant sys - tem . In human , Epsins bind to membranes enriched in phos - phatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P2 ) . It modifies membrane curvature to facilitate the formation of clathrin - coated invaginations and regulates receptor - mediated endocy - tosis ( Morinaka et al . 1999 ) . Both mammalian and yeast Epsins are also involved in endocytosis ( Chen et al . 1998 ; Wendland et al . 1999 ) . In Arabidopsis , ENTH domain - containing proteins are directly involved in vacuolar traffick - ing ( Song et al . 2006 ) and transport from the trans - Golgi net - work ( TGN ) through specific interaction with SNAREs ( Lee et al . 2007 ) . The same is also observed in yeast and mammals ( Chidambaram et al . 2008 ) . In Dictyostelium , Epsin has been shown to directly influence HIP1r , which plays a regulatory role in actin dynamics as a clathrin - associated protein ( Repass et al . 2007 ) . In case of apicomplexan parasites , little is known about clathrin - mediated protein trafficking . The role of clathrin has been shown to be essential for the formation of vesicles in trans - Golgi network as well as biogenesis of rhoptry , micronemes and pellicle ( Pieperhoff et al . 2013 ) . Single bioinformatic analyses identified the adaptor protein complexes in apicomplexan parasites ( Nevin and Dacks 2009 ) . Two further studies showed the association of AP - 1 with protein trafficking to rhoptry in P . falciparum and T . gondii ( Kaderi Kibria et al . 2015 ) ( Ngo et al . 2003 ) . There is no available article describing the role of Epsins in any of the apicomplexan parasites . Among parasites , single ENTH domain - containing protein is also identified in two important flagellate protozoan parasites , Trypanosoma brucei ( TbEpsinR ) and Giardia lamblia ( G lENTHp ) . The TbEpsinR has been shown to be involved in endocytosis and associated with clathrin although there is a discrepancy in the domain architecture with other eukaryotic systems 2192 Parasitol Res ( 2016 ) 115 : 2191 – 2202 ( Gabernet - Castello et al . 2009 ) . In G . lamblia , Epsin is shown to be associated with clathrin , AP - 2 , ubiquitin , phosphoinositides and involved in receptor - mediated endocytosis ( Feliziani et al . 2015 ) . Despite comprising a well - established endocytic and secre - tory system , no study has been carried out on the ENTH domain - containing proteins in apicomplexan parasites . So , it is still unclear to what extent the Epsins in these early branching eukaryotes is evolutionary conserved in compari - son to human , plant and yeast . This study intends to give a complete insight about this protein family and its domain and motif construction through comparative genomic and phylo - genetic analyses of the Epsin / Epsin - related ENTH domain - containing proteins in these parasites . Methods Retrieval of Epsin sequences Primarily , Epsin / ENTH domain - containing proteins in Apicomplexa were searched with human Epsin1 ( AAH44651 ) , Epsin2 ( AAH93974 ) , Epsin3 ( AAGA5223 ) and Epsin4 ( AAL30768 ) as initial queries . All the above searches were accomplished by the help of different databases of major eukaryotic supergroups ( Adl et al . 2005 ) . Therefore , the genome sequences of six Plasmodium species ( P . falciparum , Plasmodium vivax , Plasmodium berghei , Plasmodium chabaudii , Plasmodium knowlesi and Plasmodium yoelii ) from PlasmoDB ( http : / / plasmodb . org / plasmo / ) ; Eimeria tenella , N . caninum and Theileria annulata from Sanger Institute database ( http : / / www . genedb . org / genedb / annulata / blast . jsp ) ; C . parvum from CryptoDB ( http : / / cryptodb . org / cryptodb / ) ; Babesia bovis and T . parva from EuPathDB ( http : / / eupathdb . org / eupathdb / ) ; and T . gondii from ToxoDB ( http : / / www . toxodb . org / toxo / ) were used for the searches . Epsins from Homo sapiens , Mus musculus , Arabidopsis thaliana and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were retrieved from the NCBI ( http : / / www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov / ) database . The genome sequence of Phytophthora sojae was searched from Joint Genome Institute ( http : / / genome . jgipsf . org / Physo1 _ 1 / Physo1 _ 1 . home . html ) , which is a soil - borne plant pathogen used as an outgroup ( Tyler et al . 2006 ) . As it is also a member of king - dom Chromalveolata , it can assist in the reconstruction of the ancestral Epsins . Homology searching Homology searching was initially performed by using the BLASTp program ( Altschul et al . 1997 ) on all the above - mentioned databases . For the entire search , the H . sapiens Epsin homologues were used as initial queries against each database . Human proteins were selected because of their well - characterized domain structures and functional properties . The entire search was performed against non - redundant databases , and the homologs were retrieved with cut - off E value 0 . 005 or better . Identification of conserved domains and motifs To understand the functional significance of apicomplexan Epsins , we searched for conserved domains and motifs re - lated to the Epsin protein family . ENTH domain was searched in the Pfam ( http : / / pfam . sanger . ac . uk / ) program ( version 27 . 0 ) of the Sanger Institute , among all the genes obtained through BLASTp result . This database is a large collection of protein families that is represented by multiple sequence alignments and hidden Markov models ( HMMs ) ( Punta et al . 2012 ) . For the identification of motifs related to Epsins , we used ScanProsite ( http : / / prosite . expasy . org / scanprosite / ) of Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics ( de Castro et al . 2006 ) . Phylogenetic analysis Phylogenetic analysis was performed on the selected se - quences based on the conserved ENTH domain through mul - tiple sequence alignment using Jalview v2 . 0 tool ( www . jalview . org / help . html ) ( Waterhouse et al . 2009 ) . For the con - struction of phylogenetic tree , CLC Sequence Viewer v7 . 0 . 2 ( http : / / www . clcbio . com / ) was used . Here , the neighbour - joining tree construction method was used with bootstrapping replicates of 1000 . Secondary and tertiary structure determination Secondary structures of all the protein sequences were deter - mined by Jpred3 , a web - based server ( http : / / www . compbio . dundee . ac . uk / www - jpred / ) of the university of Dundee ( Cole et al . 2008 ) and visualized through Jalview , a multiple se - quence alignment editor and analysis workbench ( Waterhouse et al . 2009 ) . Secondary structure of the ENTH domain of Th . annulata was found to be different from the conserved domain structure , which was determined through SABLE ( http : / / sable . cchmc . org / ) ( Adamczak et al . 2005 ) . Three - dimensional structures of all the protein sequences were predicted by MODELLER ( Sali et al . 1995 ) through HHpred ( http : / / toolkit . tuebingen . mpg . de / hhpred ) and HHpred makemodel ( Soding 2005 ) ( Soding et al . 2005 ) , tools of the Max - Planck Institute for Development Biology . The respective templates used for modelling of all the Epsins as well as their identities over lengths with the targets are pre - sented in the Table S4 . Three - dimensional structures were visualized through PyMOL molecular graphics system , ver - sion 1 . 5 . 0 . 4 ( Schrödinger , LLC , Portland , OR , USA ) . Finally , Parasitol Res ( 2016 ) 115 : 2191 – 2202 2193 the quality of the predicted structure was determined by PROCHECK ( Fig . S4 ) ( Laskowski et al . 1996 ) . Results Only a single Epsin homolog present in apicomplexan parasites The genome of higher eukaryotes like human and mouse consists of four Epsin genes . Yeast genome contains five Epsin homologs labelled as Ent1p – Ent5p . However , only a single Epsin homolog was retrieved from each apicomplexan genome when the genomes were searched using Epsin sequences of H . sapiens as initial queries . We also utilized the yeast homologs to identify Epsin homolog from To . gondii and used it as an alternative query to im - prove the assessment . This alternative query was necessary to decide whether the other Epsin homologs were really missing or undetectable due to divergence from human ho - mologs . The gene names of apicomplexan Epsin homolog , their gene IDs , respective organism and respective orthologs in H . sapiens are mentioned in Table 1 . From the 14 apicomplexan parasites analyzed , nine Epsin homo - logs showed significant sequence similarities with Epsin1 , three Epsin homologs with Epsin2 and a single Epsin ho - molog with Epsin3 , and a single Epsin homolog showed sequence similarity with Epsin4 of H . sapiens ( Tables 1 and S1 ) . The location of the respective genes in Chromosome and relative protein characteristics are shown in Table 2 . Phylogenetic analyses of apicomplexan Epsins based on their conserved ENTH domain show a cluster among Plasmodium Epsins . The Plasmodium Epsins along with T . gondii and C . parvum Epsins are distantly related to A . thaliana Epsin1 . The Epsins of B . bovis , T . parva , T . annulata and P . sojae are distantly related to Epsin3 and Epsin4 of H . sapiens whereas E . tenella and N . caninum Epsins are related to A . thaliana Epsin3 ( Fig . 1 ) . A conserved ENTH domain present in apicomplexan Epsin The ENTH domain is ∼ 150aa residue region of Epsins which is highly conserved among yeast , plant and human and placed invariably at the N - terminus ( Kay et al . 1999 ) . Our study with apicomplexan Epsins shows a conserved ENTH domain at the N - terminus of each protein ( Fig . 2 ) . The length of this domain varies from 94aa ( T . annulata ) to 131aa ( P . yoelii ) ( Table S2 ) . Homology modelling suggests that all the apicomplexan Epsins consist of eight α - helices organized in a similar orientation as human Epsin1 ( Figs . 3 and 4 , S1 and S3 ) , except for T . annulata which comprises only six α - helices lacking the fifth and sixth α - helices ( Fig . S2 ) . The P . sojae Epsin is unique in its structure as it contains only the ENTH domain and lacks the remaining two thirds of unstructured region ( Figs . 2 and 4c ) . The se - quence alignments in Fig . 3 and the values in Table S1 show very little conservation between Epsin sequences . Apicomplexan Epsin losses canonical clathrin - binding motif except variants There are some subunits of adaptor protein complexes that recruit clathrin through a clathrin - binding sequence termed as clathrin box . This box contains the consensus sequence of L φ X φ D / E ( where φ is a bulky hydrophobic residue ) and lies Table 1 The Epsin homologues of apicomplexan parasites Protein Gene ID Gene name Organisms Orthologs Pf Epsin PF3D7 _ 1245800 Clathrin coat assembly protein AP180 , putative Plasmodium falciparum Epsin1 Pb Epsin PBANKA _ 145890 Clathrin coat assembly protein AP180 , putative Plasmodium berghei Epsin1 Pc Epsin PCHAS _ 146120 Clathrin coat assembly protein AP180 , putative Plasmodium chabaudii Epsin1 Pk Epsin PKH _ 146310 Clathrin coat assembly protein AP180 , putative Plasmodium knowlesi Epsin2 Pv Epsin PVX _ 101180 ENTH domain - containing protein Plasmodium vivax Epsin2 Py Epsin PY07827 Vitellogenin Plasmodium yoelii Epsin1 Ta Epsin TA20280 Serine - rich hypothetical protein Theileria annulata Epsin1 Tp Epsin TP01 _ 0558 Hypothetical protein Theileria parva Epsin2 Bb Epsin BBOV _ I002870 Hypothetical protein Babesia bovis Epsin4 Tg Epsin TGME49 _ 214180 ENTH domain - containing protein Toxoplasma gondii Epsin1 Cp Epsin cgd8 _ 1910 Epsin - like ENTH / VHS domain involved in endocytosis / vesicular trafficking Cryptosporidium parvum Epsin1 Ps Epsin PHYSODRAFT _ 384851 Hypothetical protein Phytophthora sojae Epsin1 Et Epsin ETH _ 00023390 EPN3 protein , putative Eimeria tenella Epsin 3 Nc Epsin NCLIV _ 051420 KLLA0B04587p , related Neospora caninum Epsin 1 2194 Parasitol Res ( 2016 ) 115 : 2191 – 2202 in the hinge region ( Owen et al . 2004 ) . As Epsins are reported to bind with clathrin and regulate the formation of vesicles , we searched for the common clathrin box motifs in the Epsins . The L φ X φ D / E is present in both human Epsin1 and 2 as well as Mouse Epsin1 at the C - terminal end , however absent in yeast Ent1p and Ent2p ( Fig . 2 ) . Among the apicomplexan Epsins , C . parvum consists of both clathrin box motifs L φ X φ D and L φ X φ E ; besides , T . gondii , E . tenella and N . caninum consist of only L φ X φ D . However , none of these two motifs could be found in other apicomplexan Epsins . The sequence alignment of all the apicomplexan Epsins shows an L φ X φ D / E islet in the same region as L φ X φ E in ENTH domain of C . parvum Epsin ( Fig . 3a ) . The amino acid in the φ region is not always hydrophobic rather partially hydropho - bic and / or hydrophilic suggesting the possible loss of classical clathrin box motif over time .

Neighbour - joining analysis with 1000 replicates ; bootstrap values shown as numbers from 1 to 100 at each node . The scale bar represents the branch length Parasitol Res ( 2016 ) 115 : 2191 – 2202 2195 There are some variants of clathrin - binding site termed as ‘ type II clathrin box ’ such as PWDLWand LMDLAwhich are found in mammalian Epsins and amphiphysins ( Drake and Traub 2001 ) . These types of clathrin box motifs are present in human and mouse Epsin1 , but totally absent in apicomplexans . Another variant of the clathrin box , dubbed the ‘ DLL motif ’ , comprises a central core motif of DLL or SLL surrounded by well - conserved residues , shown to exist in multiple copies in AP180 as well as in large subunits of all the tetrameric adaptor proteins ( Morgan et al . 2000 ) . The SLL motif is present in Plasmodium species ( P . yoelii , P . berghei , P . chabaudii , P . falciparum , P . knowlesi and P . vivax ) as well as P . sojae , E . tenella and yeast Ent2p ( Figs . 2 and 3 ) . On the other hand , DLL is present in B . bovis ( two copies ) , C . parvum , T . gondii , E . tenella and N . caninum ( Fig . 2 ) . On the whole analyses , no known clathrin box motifs were de - tected in T . parva and T . annulata . Apicomplexan Epsins lack ubiquitin - interacting motif The ubiquitin - interacting motif ( UIM ) is a short peptide motif in Epsin which has the ability to bind either monoubiquitin or Fig . 2 The domains and motifs of the Epsin homologs in apicomplexan parasite . The ENTH domain found at the N - termini of Epsins of apicomplexan parasites similar to that of the human and mouse . A series of motifs in Epsin ( present in ENTH domain and in the remaining two third of Epsin ) has the cpabilitytoperformmyriad roles to interact with the different types of proteins important for cellular function and clathrin - mediated vesicular trafficking . The ( D / E ) XXXL ( L / I ) motif is found within the ENTH domain of Plasmodium and E . tenella , whereas SLL motif is found in Plasmodium , E . tenella and P . sojae . The SLL motif is the clathrin - binding motif whereas D / ExxxL / I motif is known as dileucine signal . The ubiquitin - interacting motif ( UIM ) mediates the interaction with ubiquitylated proteins , lacking in apicomplexa but present in human , mouse and yeast . The other motifs are DLL , L X D / E and LMDLA responsible for the interaction with clathrin while FxDxF , DPW , DPF and NPF motifs interact with different adaptor proteins important in the clathrin - mediated vesicular trafficking  Fig . 3 Schematic diagrams showing conservation of ENTH domain of Epsins . a Sequence comparison of ENTH domains of apicomplexan Epsins with that of the human , mouse , plant and yeast , based on the ClustalW sequence alignment .

Colour coding is deep for conserved residues and light for semiconserved residues , and boxed residues designate specificity for ino - sitol ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P3 headgroups as in HsEpsin1 . Note that this alignment dif - fers from the optimal global alignment in a 2196 Parasitol Res ( 2016 ) 115 : 2191 – 2202 polyubiquitin . The ‘ UIM ’ motif is conserved throughout the eukaryotes and positioned following the ENTH domain of Epsins , which have possible roles in sorting the ubiquitinated cargoes ( Miller et al . 2004 ) . Our study shows the lack of classical UIM motif in apicomplexan Epsins that suggests the existence of a possible different mechanism by which Epsins can traffic the cargo proteins in these unicellular eukaryotes . Parasitol Res ( 2016 ) 115 : 2191 – 2202 2197 The existence of dileucine motif in some Epsins might solve the lack of known motifs [ D / E ] XXXL [ L / I ] is mainly known as dileucine signal which consists of a pair of leucine residues preceded by one or more acidic residues . The presence of dileucine signals in mamma - lian proteins mediates rapid internalization and transport of those proteins to endosomal or lysosomal compartments , sug - gesting that they can be recognized both at the plasma mem - brane and at the intracellular locations . Sequences conforming to this motif have also been implicated in basolateral targeting in polarized epithelial cells ( Matter et al . 1994 ; Vowels and Payne 1998 ) . This type of dileucine motif has never been reported in any kind of ENTH domain - containing proteins . Our study shows the existence of a single dileucine motif ( [ D / E ] XXXL [ L / I ] ) in the ENTH domain of Epsins in Plasmodium species ( P . vivax , P . falciparum , P . yoelii , P . berghei , P . knowlesi and P . chabaudii ) and at the exactly same position of E . tenella Epsin ( Figs . 2 and 3a ) . The motif is also present at the extreme N - terminus of C . parvum Epsin . Association with other adaptor proteins The N - terminal one third of Epsin is a conserved globular structure ; however , the remaining two thirds of the protein contain essentially no secondary structures ( Kalthoff et al . 2002 ) . There are multiple short peptide motifs within this extended , unstructured domain those might individually per - form related functions in protein trafficking . Human Epsin1 contains eight copies of DPW motif in this region which are mainly involved in the interaction with α - ear appendage of AP - 2 ( Owen et al . 1999 ) . DPW motif is present in human Epsin1 , Epsin2 and mouse Epsin1 ; however , Epsins from nei - ther of the apicomplexans , yeast and plant were found to con - tain the motif . The α - ear appendage domain binding candidate FXDXF and WXX ( F / W ) motifs show tight binding whereas DXF ( DPF ) and FXXF motifs show weak binding with α - ear ( Olesen et al . 2008 ) . DXF , FXXF , FXDXF and WXXX ( F / W ) motifs were found in single or multiple copies in different apicomplexan parasites for which the result is summarized in Table S3 . Epsins also contain multiple copies of NPF motif , which bind to the EH ( Eps15 homology ) domains of the endocytic proteins Eps15 and intersectin ( Chen et al . 1998 ; Hussain et al . 1999 ; Salcini et al . 1997 ) . Human Epsin1 and Epsin2 consist of three NPF motifs , whereas yeast Ent1p and Ent2p contain two NPF motifs . Single NPF motif is found in the Epsin ho - mologs of C . parvum , T . annulata , T . parva , T . gondii and N . caninum . Plasmodium Epsins and A . thaliana Epsin which do not contain any NPF motif which indicates no functional in - volvement with Eps15 and / or intersectin . Apicomplexan Epsins contain PtdIns - binding site The regulation of many trafficking events , like the formation of vesicles in specific sites is dependent on the controlled localization of some proteins to specific sites on membranes . These proteins mainly consist of conserved modular domains Fig . 4 Homology structure models of homologs of Epsins of T . annulata ( Ta ) , P . sojae ( Ps ) , P . falciparum ( Pf ) and B . bovis ( Bb ) and their comparison with 3D structure of human Epsin1 . a Hs Epsin1 . b Ta Epsin . c Ps Epsin . d Pf Epsin . e Bb Epsin . f Overlap 2198 Parasitol Res ( 2016 ) 115 : 2191 – 2202 to specifically recognize phosphoinositides , which can be re - stricted to particular sites on membranes ( Cullen et al . 2001 ) . The critical amino acid residues by which ENTH domain in - teracts with phosphoinositides were revealed when the crystal structure of ENTH in the presence of inositol - 1 , 4 , 5 - triphos - phate ( Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P3 ) was solved ( Ford et al . 2002 ) . Moreover , mutational studies showed that similar amino acids are re - sponsible for binding not only Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P3 but also PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P2 , which is essential for Epsin binding in mem - branes ( Itoh et al . 2001 ) . Our Conserved Domain Database ( CCD ) - based analyses show similar region in the apicomplexan Epsins suggesting their ability to bind PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P2 ( Fig . 3b ) , except for B . bovis and T . annulata . The amino acid residues are conserved among apicomplexan parasites , however diverse from that of the human and yeast . Discussion Membrane budding drives the formation of endocytic vesicles for the internalization of nutrients , receptors and other proteins at the cell surface . Epsin plays an important role to form the membrane budding for protein trafficking . In case of higher eukaryotes , different Epsins are involved in trafficking of pro - teins in different routes , like Epsin1 and 2 , which are involved in endocytosis ( Maldonado - Baez and Wendland 2006 ) . In yeast , Ent3p and Ent5p are shown to be involved in trafficking of proteins between TGN and endosome in association with AP1 and GGAs ( Copic et al . 2007 ) . Existence of only a single gene is really interesting for the possible functional role of apicomplexan Epsin in certain route of protein trafficking . As parasite Epsins are mostly homologs of Epsin1 and Epsin2 , we speculate a probable role of these Epsins in endo - cytosis . Endocytosis is a crucial process for the intracellular parasites as they take food from the surrounding host cell and recruit proteins by this mechanism . For instance , P . falciparum ingest proteins from red blood cells and traffic them to their food vacuole by their endocytic machineries . Phylogenetic analyses of early branching eukaryotes are particularly useful for defining their plant - like , protist - like or animal - like features . Such attributes are useful for predicting conserved functions and for identifying proteins that may have distinctly different properties in parasites . Homology - based searching in combination with phylogenetic analyses allowed classification of plant - versus animal - like pathways and identification of parasite - specific genes with probable functional role that will direct future functional studies . We have performed phylogenetic analysis of apicomplexan Epsins that shows orthologous character of parasite ENTH domains . ENTH domain contributes to the nucleation and formation of clathrin coats on membrane by interacting with inositol phospholipids and proteins . It can also function in the formation of clathrin - coated vesicles by developing mem - brane curvature through lipid remodelling ( Legendre - Guillemin et al . 2004 ) . Studies on Epsin1 show that this do - main is a compact globular structure consisting of eight α - helices that are connected by loops of varying length ( De Camilli et al . 2002 ; Hyman et al . 2000 ) . The ENTH domain shows high degree of structural similarities with the armadillo repeats of beta - catenin , the heat repeat of karyopherin - beta and the VHS domain of human Tom1 ( Hyman et al . 2000 ) . The structure of most of the apicomplexan Epsins is homolo - gous with the structure of human Epsin1 , whereas T . annulata lacks two α - helices . However , all these Epsins are showing little sequence similarities with that of human Epsins ( Table S1 ) . As only the ENTH domain is conserved and the remain - ing two thirds of the proteins are much more diverse , so se - quence similarities based on the full sequence are very low . However , the structures of ENTH domain in different Epsins are homologous , which has been shown in secondary struc - tures ( Fig . 3 ) and 3D structures ( Fig . S1 ) . The consensus clathrin - binding motif , e . g . L Φ X Φ D / E and some variants like DLL or SLL motifs , is present in apicomplexan Epsins providing evidence that these Epsins might play role in clathrin - mediated protein traffick - ing . However , the Epsins of T . parva and T . annulata lack these motifs , suggesting lack of their functional ability . Though there is no known clathrin - binding motifs present in yeast Ent1p , one interesting variant of clathrin - binding site has been discovered , which shows that extreme C - terminal residues ( RGYTLIDL ) are responsible for binding clathrin ( Wendland et al . 1999 ) . So , mutational study is required to understand their exact role in T . parva and T . annulata . Ubiquitylation is a post - translational modification resulting in the covalent attachment of ubiquitin through its COOH terminal Gly to the ε - NH2 group of a Lys residue on a target protein . Polyubiquitination via the Lys 48 of the ubiquitin re - sults in the degradation of the target protein by proteasome . However , ubiquitylation through the Lys 63 leads to some cel - lular processes , e . g . DNA repair , translation , I κ B kinase acti - vation , endocytosis and protein transport ( reviewed in ( Weissman 2001 ) ) . The absence of classical UIM motif in apicomplexan Epsins is an interesting observation , and further studies can be done to understand how apicomplexan Epsins can retain the functional ability without having the UIM mo - tifs as some studies showed that mutation of UIM motif from Epsin leads to defects in protein trafficking ( Shih et al . 2002 ) . It is possible that these Epsins contain some uncharacterized motifs rather than the classical UIM to maintain the interaction with ubiquitins . The dileucine motifs are reported in cargo proteins which are mainly sorted by adaptor protein complexes — AP1 , AP2 and AP3 ( Hofmann et al . 1999 ) . The affinity of these motifs with AP - complexes is mainly dependent on the LL or LI pairs Parasitol Res ( 2016 ) 115 : 2191 – 2202 2199 and , in some cases , on the acidic residues at positions 4 and 5 from the first leucine , thus paralleling the sequence require - ments for function of the signals . In this study , we have found dileucine motif in Ent1p and Ent2p of yeast ( Fig . 2 ) ; however , there are no bioinformatic or functional studies carried out on this motif in yeast as far as our concern . The presence of dileucine motifs indicates the possible role of Plasmodium , E . tenella and C . parvum to function in association with the adaptor protein complexes present in respective organisms . As this is found in the same position in Plasmodium and E . tenella , we checked the position of dileucine motif of P . falciparum and it is located at the surface of Pf Epsin 3D structure which is providing evidence that this is available for binding with other proteins ( Fig . S5 ) . The presence of multiple copies of α - ear appendage - binding motifs stands as a proof to the possible association of the Epsins with AP - 2 in these parasites , allowing us to presume about the role of these Epsins in endocytosis . On the other hand , DFG motif is shown to be responsible for binding with γ - ear appendage present in Golgi - localizing , gamma - adaptin ear domain homology ARF - binding adap - tors ( GGA ) . Only the Epsin homolog of C . parvum consists of DFG motif indicating its possible role for the interaction with AP - 1 . Most of the apicomplexan Epsins contain NPF motif indicating their interaction with EH domain - containing proteins . Plasmodium Epsins lack this motif suggesting absence of interaction . Recent study has shown the role of Eps15 homology domain - containing protein ( PfEHD ) of P . falciparum in endocytosis and targeted to the neutral lipid storage site localized near the food vacuole ( Thakur et al . 2015 ) . Phospoinositides are the phosphorylated forms of phospha - tidyl inositol ( PtdIns ) that have the ability to be modified rapidly by head group phosphorylation / dephosphorylation and create transient signals for membrane targeting at partic - ular locations . The domains reported to interact with phosphoinositides include pleckstrin homology ( PH ) , FYVE , phox homology ( PX ) , ENTH , ANTH , Tubby and FERM domains ( Cullen et al . 2001 ) . The binding of Epsin to membranes facilitates their deformation by insertion of the N - terminal helix of ENTH domain into the inner leaf - let of the bilayer , pushing the head groups apart . In this way , it reduces the energy required to curve the membrane into a vesicle which facilitates clathrin cage to fix and stabilize the curved membrane . This point suggests the role of Epsin in vesicle budding , as it provides both a driving force and a link between membrane invagination and clathrin polymerization . The amino acid residues in the PtdIns - binding sites in apicomplexan Epsins are con - served in this phylum , but they are diverse from Epsins of human and yeast indicating possible functional diver - gence . Variations within these residues may indicate al - tered affinity for PtdInsP binding . Conclusions On the whole , our data suggest the existence of single Epsin homolog in each apicomplexan parasite consisting of well - conserved ENTH domain with PtdIns - binding site . Motif analyses indicate their ability to bind clathrin and other adap - tor proteins required for vesicular trafficking in different di - rections . Although apicomplexan Epsins lack a lot of known motifs , C . parvum Epsin consists of several motifs suggesting its diverse role in protein trafficking . The absence of UIM motif in all the apicomplexan Epsins will surely direct future work about the existence of possible new mechanism for the functioning of these proteins . T . parva and T . annulata are shown to lack the clathrin - binding motif which might lead to their inability to function via the classical mechanism . However , the existence of α - appendage - binding domain sug - gests a possible way for the replenishment of clathrin incor - poration in the vesicles through AP - 2 . P . sojae Epsin , which contains only the ENTH domain and a single clathrin - binding motif , may have evolutionary significance for the loss of the remaining two thirds of the unstructured C - terminal domain . The carefully annotated and complete listing of the Epsin genes along with computational analyses performed in this study will facilitate future researches to characterize their functions in apicomplexan parasites . However , final annota - tions of molecular functions and respective biological path - ways require experimental evidences .
