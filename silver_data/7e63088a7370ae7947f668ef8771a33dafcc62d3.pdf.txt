Bafilomycin AI , a Specific Inhibitor of Vacuolar - type H + - ATPase , Inhibits Acidification and Protein Degradation in Lysosomes of Cultured Cells * ( Received for publication , April 15 , 1991 ) Tamotsu Yoshimori , Akitsugu Yamamoto , Yoshinori MoriyamaS , Masamitsu FutaiS , and Yutaka TashiroQ From the Department of Physiology , Kansai Medical University , Fumizono - cho , Moriguchi , Osaka 570 , Japan and the $ Department of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry , Institute of Scientific and Industrial Research , Osaka Uniuersity , Ibaraki , Osaka 567 , Japan Bafilomycin AI is known as a strong inhibitor of the vacuolar type H + - ATPase in vitro , whereas other type ATPases , e . g . F1 , Fo - ATPase , are not affected by this antibiotic ( Bowman , E . M . , Siebers , A . , and Altendorf , K . ( 1988 ) Proc . Natl . Acad . Sci . U . S . A . 85 , 7972 - 7976 ) . Effects of this inhibitor on lysosomes of living cultured cells were tested . The acidification of lyso - somes revealed by the incubation with acridine orange was completely inhibited when BNL CL . 2 and A431 cells were treated with 0 . 1 - 1 PM bafilomycin A1 . The effect was reversed by washing the cells . Both studies using 3 - ( 2 , 4 - dinitroanilino ) - 3’ - amino - N - methyldipro - pylamine and fluorescein isothiocyanate - dextran showed that the intralysosomal pH of A431 cells in - creased from about 5 . 1 - 5 . 5 to about 6 . 3 in the presence of 1 PM bafilomycin A1 . The pH increased gradually in about 50 min . In the presence of 1 PM bafilomycin A1 , ‘“SI - labeled epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) bound to the cell surface at 4 “C was internalized normally into the cells at 37 “C but was not degraded at all , in marked contrast to the rapid degradation of lZ5I - EGF in the control cells without the drug . Immunogold electron microscopy showed that EGF was transported into ly - sosomes irrespective of the addition of bafilomycin A1 . These results suggest that the vacuolar type H + - ATP - ase plays a pivotal role in acidification and protein degradation in the lysosomes in uiuo . The central vacuolar system consists of the membrane organelles that belong to the exo - and endocytic pathways : the endoplasmic reticulum , the Golgi apparatus including the trans - Golgi network , secretory granules , secretory vesicles , endosomes , lysosomes , and the plasma membrane ( Klausner , 1989 ) . These multiple compartments communicate with each other by shuttling transport vesicles and are involved in biosynthesis , processing , sorting , transport , and degradation of proteins and other macromolecules . The internal acidifi - cation of some compartments in the central vacuolar system is suggested to play an important role in such processes ( for review , see Mellman et al . ( 1986 ) ) . * This work was supported in part by a grant - in - aid for Scientific Research from the Ministry of Education , Science , and Culture of Japan .

Recently , proton - translocating ATPases have been identi - fied as a new class of H’ - ATPase and referred to as the vacuolar type H’ - ATPase ( V - ATPases ) ’ ( Nelson and Taiz , 1989 ) . V - ATPases have been identified and purified from organelles belonging to the central vacuolar system , such as coated vesicles ( Xie et al . , 1986 ; Arai et al . , 1987 ) , chromaffin granules ( Moriyama and Nelson , 1987 ) , the Golgi complex ( Moriyama and Nelson , 1989a ) , lysosomes ( Moriyama and Nelson , 1989b ) , neurosecretory granules ( Moriyama and Fu - tai , 1990 ) , and fungal vacuoles ( Uchida et al . , 1985 ; Bowman and Bowman , 1986 ) and have been characterized extensively at the molecular level in recent several years . At present , V - ATPases are the most probable candidate for the generator of the acidity in the central vacuolar system . . V - ATPases show distinct sensitivities against several in - hibitors when compared to F , , Fo - ATPase in the mitochondria and El , E2 - ATPases in the plasma membranes . The V - AT - Pases are sensitive to N - ethylmaleimide but insensitive to oligomycin and azide , which are inhibitors of F , , Fo - ATPase , and to vanadate , which is an inhibitor of El , E2 - ATPases . Moreover , recently , bafilomycin A1 , a macrolide antibiotic isolated from Streptomyces sp . ( Werner et al . , 1984 ) , was found to be a highly specific inhibitor of the V - ATPase ( Bowman et al . , 1988 ) . This inhibitor is effective at nanomolar concentra - tions in vitro and inhibits neither Fl , Fo - nor El , E2 - ATPases ( Bowman et al . , 1988 ; Hanada et al . , 1990 ) . If bafilomycin A , can permeate into the organelles of living cells through the plasma membranes without killing the cells , one could directly examine in vivo relationships between the V - ATPase , the acidification of the organelles , and the various functions of the central vacuolar system . In this study , we examined the effect of bafilomycin A , on living cultured cells and found that bafilomycin AI can effectively inhibit in viuo acidification of lysosomes and the degradation of an endocy - tosed protein . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Materials - The following materials were used : bafilomycin A , , kindly given by Prof . K . Altendorf ( Universitat Osnabruck , Ger - many ) ; acridine orange ( Chroma , Germany ) ; 3 - ( 2 , 4 - dinitroanilino ) - 3’ - amino - N - methyldipropylamine ( DAMP ) ( Oxford Biochemical Re - search , Oxford , MI ) ; fluorescein isothiocyanate ( F1TC ) - conjugated dextran ( average molecular weight , 71 , 200 ; Sigma ) ; serum - free com - The abbreviations used are : V - ATPase , vacuolar type H + - ATP - ase ; DAMP , 3 - ( 2 , 4 - dinitroanilino ) - 3’ - amino - N - methyldipropyla - mine ; FITC , fluorescein isothiocyanate ; EGF , epidermal growth fac - tor ; BSA , bovine serum albumin ; MEM , minimal essential medium ; DMEM , Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium ; FCS , fetal calf serum ; Me , SO , dimethyl sulfoxide ; PBS , phosphate - buffered saline . 17707 17708 Effects of Bafilomycin on Lysosomal Functions plete medium ( COSMEDIUM , Cosmo - Bio , Japan ) ; mouse epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) ( Wako , Japan ) ; ' 2 ' II - labeled EGF ( Amersham , Japan ) ; rabbit antiserum against dinitrophenol - conjugated bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) ( Seikagaku Kogyo , Japan ) ; mouse monoclonal antibody Ab - 1 against human EGF ( Oncogene Science , Inc . , Man - hasset , NY ) ; sheep antibody against human cathepsin B ( Binding Site , Ltd . , Birmingham , England ) ; rabbit antibody against mouse IgG ( Dakopatts , Denmark ) ; rabbit antibody against sheep IgG ( Cappel , West Chester , PA ) . Cell Culture - A431 , human epidermoid carcinoma cell line , and BNL CL . 2 , mouse normal embryonic liver cell line , obtained from the American Type Culture Collection ( Rockville , MD ) , were cultured in FCS / DMEM ( Dulbecco ' s modified Eagle medium ( DMEM ) con - taining 12 % fetal calf serum ( FCS ) ) . Vital Fluorescence Microscopy - The living cultured cells were stained with acridine orange following the method previously de - scribed ( Geisow et al . , 1980 ) . The cells grown on cover slips were incubated at 37 " C for 1 h with FCS / DMEM containing 1 / 100 volume of bafilomycin A , dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide ( Me , SO ) . For con - trol experiments , only Me2S0 was added to the medium instead of the bafilomycin A , solution . Then the cells were incubated at 37 " C for 10 min with 5 pg / ml acridine orange in Hanks ' solution . After four washings with Hanks ' solution , the coverslips were examined by a fluorescence light microscopy ( Olympus BH - 2 ) . Fluorescence mi - crographs were taken with the same shutter speed for each experiment by using Kodak Ektachrome film . Measurement of Zntralysosomal pH - The intralysosomal pH of A431 cells was measured by the two methods . The first is a DAMP method according to Orci et al . ( 1986 ) . Briefly , A431 cells grown in 96 - well culture plates were incubated at 37 " C for 1 h with 1 p ~ bafilomycin A , in FCS / DMEM or with only MezSO in the same medium . Then , DAMP was added at a final concentration of 50 p ~ , and the cells were incubated at 37 " C for 1 more h . After three washings with phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) , the cells were fixed , and the localization and quantity of DAMP were determined by immunogold electron microscopy as described below . We estimated pH according to the formula of Orci et al . ( 1986 ) ; pH = 7 . 0 - log I / N , where N is the density of DAMP - specific gold particles in a pH 7 . 0 compartment ( the nucleus ) and L is the density of DAMP - specific gold particles in lysosomes . Second is a FITC - conjugated dextrans method devised by Ohkuma and Poole ( 1978 ) . A431 cells grown on cover slips were exposed to 1 mg / ml FITC - conjugated dextran ( previously dialyzed against PBS ) for 24 h at 37 " C in the culture medium , washed with FCS / DMEM twice and incubated at 37 " C for 1 h with 1 p ~ bafilomycin A , in the same medium or for 10 min with other drugs . After washing the cells with PBS , fluorescence emission intensity , at 510 nm , of the cells in PBS was measured with excitation at 440 and 490 nm using a microspectrofluorometer ( IMT - 2 - OSP , Olympus ) , the detailed com - position of which was described elsewhere ( Tsunoda et al . , 1989 ) . The pH of any subcellular regions could be analyzed by using a pinhole unit ( 5 pm in diameter ) , a photomultiplier , and an Olympus UVFL X 100 objective lens . Backgrounds of cellular autofluorescence at each excitation wavelength ( Zb440 and Zb490 ) measured in the cells contain - ing no FITC - dextrans were subtracted from the data ( Z440 and 14w ) . The intralysosomal pH was calculated from a standard curve relating the ratio ( Z440 - Zb440 ) / ( Z490 - Zb490 ) with pH . The standard curve was generated using 220 pg / ml FITC - dextrans in 0 . 1 M Tris - HC1 or sodium acetate buffers at various pH values . Fluorescence micro - graphs were taken by an Olympus BH - 2 . For the time course experi - ment , A431 cells were incubated with FITC - dextrans , and the change in the intralysosomal pH was investigated in serum - free complete medium COSMEDIUM by a Hitachi F - 2000 fluorospectrophotometer according to the procedure of Ohkuma and Poole ( 1978 ) ( fluorescence emission at 519 nm with excitation at 450 and 495 nm ) . Measurement of Intracellular Degradation of 125Z - EGF - - Intracel - lular degradation of ' 2 ' II - labeled EGF was measured by essentially the same method as described previously by Glenney et al . ( 1988 ) . BNL CL . 2 and A431 cells grown in 6 - cm diameter dishes were washed twice with minimal essential medium containing 0 . 1 % BSA ( BSA / MEM ) . After preincubation in BSA / MEM at 37 " C for 20 min , cells were incubated in the same medium containing 1 pCi ( for BNL CL . 2 cells ) or 0 . 5 pCi ( for A431 cells ) of " ' I - EGF at 4 " C for 2 h . After three washings with BSA / MEM , cells were treated with 1 p ~ bafi - lomycin A , in COSMEDIUM containing 0 . 1 % bovine serum albumin or with only Me2S0 in the same medium at 37 " C . Aliquots of medium collected from dishes at the indicated times were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid at a final concentration of 8 . 3 % , placed in ice for 20 min , and then centrifuged to separate acid - soluble and - insoluble materials . Cells were solubilized with 1 % Triton X - 100 , centrifuged to remove insoluble material , and then precipitated with trichloroa - cetic acid . Radioactivities of each sample were measured by a Packard MINAXI y auto - y counter . The values were indicated as percent of total counts ( the sum of values from trichloroacetic acid - soluble and - insoluble fractions of cells and medium at the end of the incubation and Triton - insoluble fractions of cells ; about 80 , 000 cpm for BNL CL . 2 cells and about 400 , 000 cpm for A431 cells ) . The trichloroacetic acid - soluble counts of medium were regarded as degraded ' * ' I - EGF after correction by subtraction of the time 0 value ( 0 . 4 - 0 . 5 % ) . Measurement of Internalization of ' 2 ' Z - EGF - BNL CL . 2 cells grown in 3 . 5 - cm plastic dishes were treated with 0 . 25 pCi of " ' I - EGF as in the degradation experiment described above . Internalization of cell surface - bound " ' I - EGF into the cells was measured in the pres - ence of 1 PM bafilomycin A , or the absence ( adding only Me , SO ) , as previously described ( Haigler et al . , 1980 ; Glenney et al . , 1988 ) ; " ' I - EGF that was bound to the cell surface was removed with 5 mM acetic acid containing 0 . 15 M NaCl , and the cells were then lysed with 1 M NaOH . Zmmuno - gold Electron Microscopy - The DAMP - treated cells were fixed for 2 h with 1 % glutaraldehyde in 0 . 1 M sodium phosphate buffer ( pH 7 . 4 ) . The fixed cells were embedded in Lowicryl K4M ( Roth et al . , 1981 ) together with the plastic dishes ( 96 wells ) , and the plastic dishes were removed after hardening the resin . Ultrathin sections of the cells were cut parallel to the bottom of the dishes . The ultrastructural localization and quantity of DAMP in these cells was investigated by a postembedding protein A - gold technique , as de - scribed elsewhere ( Yoshimori et al . , 1990 ) , using rabbit anti - dinitro - phenol conjugated to BSA antiserum ( diluted 1 : 50 , v / v ) . In order to localize the endocytosed EGF , the A431 cells were preincubated as described above , treated with BSA / MEM containing 164 nM EGF at 4 " C for 2 h , and then incubated at 37 " C for 5 or 30 min in the absence ( only Me2SO ) or the presence of 1 p ~ bafilomycin A , . The cells were fixed for 10 min with 4 % formaldehyde and 1 % glutaraldehyde in 0 . 1 M cacodylate buffer ( pH 7 . 4 ) at the end of the incubation . Embedding and ultrathin sectioning was carried out as in the DAMP experiment . The ultrastructural localization of endo - cytosed EGF in these ultrathin sections was investigated using mouse monoclonal anti - EGF antibody ( 20 pg / ml ) and rabbit anti - mouse IgG ( 50 mg / ml ) . For double staining , after sequential reaction with the anti - EGF antibody , the anti - mouse IgG , and protein A - gold ( 4 - nm gold particles ) , the remaining free binding sites of protein A were blocked with 10 pg / ml protein A in PBS containing 0 . 5 % BSA at room temperature for 10 min . Then the ultrathin sections were incubated with sheep anti - human cathepsin B antibody ( 50 pg / ml ) , rabbit anti - sheep IgG ( 50 pg / ml ) , and protein A - gold ( 8 - nm gold particles ) , successively . RESULTS Bafilomycin A1 Inhibits Acidification of Lysosomes - Effects of bafilomycin A1 on acidification of lysosomes were tested by vital staining with acridine orange . This dye is an " acido - tropic " weak base , which is taken up by living cells and accumulates in acidified compartments such as lysosomes ( Allison and Young , 1969 ; Holtzman , 1989 ) . Fluorescence of acridine orange is green at low concentrations , whereas at high concentrations the fluorescence changes to orange ( Ai - lison and Young , 1969 ) . When A431 and BNL CL . 2 cells were stained with acridine orange , nuclei , particularly the nucleoli and the cytoplasms , showed green fluorescence , whereas or - ange fluorescence was observed in a granular pattern in the cytoplasm ( Fig . 1 , panels I and 3 ) . This distribution pattern suggests that the orange fluorescence is due to acidified lyso - somes . Treatment of both cells with 1 PM bafilomycin AI at 37 " C for 1 h before acridine orange - staining caused complete disappearance of the orange fluorescence , whereas the green fluorescence remained as such as shown in Fig . 1 , panel 2 ( A431 cells ) . ( A corresponding micrograph for BNL CL . 2 cells was not shown . ) Bafilomycin A , at lower concentrations was also effective . 10 nM bafilomycin A1 markedly decreased or - ange fluorescence in BNL CL . 2 cells ( panel 4 ) , and at a final concentration of 100 nM , the fluorescence in these cells com - FIG . 1 .

Panel 6 shows the staining pattern after treatment with 100 nM bafilomycin A , for 1 h followed by washing and incubation without baf - ilomycin AI for 30 min . Bur , 30 pm .

After washing , the acidification of lysosomes in BNL CL . 2 cells recovered completely , as shown in panel 6 ; the cells were treated with 100 nh4 bafilomycin AI for 1 h , washed , and then incubated for 30 min without the drug . These results suggested that bafilomycin AI can permeate through the plasma mem - branes and inhibit the acidification of lysosomes reversibly by interacting with vacuolar type H + - ATPase in the lysosomal membranes . Increase in Intralysosomal pH by Bafilomycin A , - The in - crease in intralysosomal pH by 1 p ~ bafiiomycin A , in A431 cells was also estimated by the DAMP method . DAMP is , like acridine orange , a weak base and accumulates in acidic com - partments . Moreover , this molecule is retained at the site of accumulation after aldehyde fixation and is detectable by immuno - gold electron microscopy because it contains a dini - trophenol group for easy detection with an anti - dinitrophenol antibody ( for review , see Anderson and Orci ( 1988 ) ) . Accu - mulation of DAMP - specific gold particles was observed in lysosome - like multivesicular structures of DAMP - treated A431 cells ( Fig . 2 , left ) . Treatment of the cells with 1 PM FIG . 2 . Ultrastructural localization of DAMP in baf ' ilomy - cin AI - treated cells . A431 cells were incubated at 37 " C for 1 h in the absence ( only Me , SO ) ( left panel ) or the presence of 1 p ~ bafilomycin A , ( right panel ) . 50 pM DAMP was then added to the cells , which were incubated at 37 " C for 1 more h . The cells were fixed , embedded in Lowicryl K4M , and processed for protein A - gold localization of DAMP .

' Numher of cells measured . of the bafilomycin - treated cells was about one - fifth that in lysosomes of control cells , whereas the density in neutral pH compartments such as the nucleus was not affected by the drug treatment . From the DAMP - specific gold particle den - sity , we estimated that the intralysosomal pH of A431 cells increased from 5 . 5 to 6 . 3 by 1 p ~ bafilomycin AI ( for the formula , see " Experimental Procedures " ) . This result was confirmed by measuring the fluorescence emission of fluid phase pinocytosed FITC - dextrans according to the procedure of Ohkuma and Poole ( 1978 ) . Incubation of A431 cells with FITC - dextrans for 24 h resulted in accumu - lation of this fluorescence probe within the cells as a punctate lysosome - like pattern ( Fig . 3 , left ) , and their fluorescence intensity was increased by the treatment with 1 p ~ bafilo - mycin A , for 1 h ( Fig . 3 , right ) . It has been reported that the fluorescence intensity of FITC increases according to the rise in surrounding pH ( Ohkuma and Poole , 1978 ) . Next , the ratios in fluorescence emission intensities at 510 nm following excitation at 490 and 440 nm were measured by microspectro - fluorometry ( Table 11 ) . Intralysosomal pH was calculated as 5 . 14 in control A431 cells and 6 . 30 in 1 pM bafilomycin - treated cells from the standard curve . The degree of the increase in pH by 1 p ~ bafilomycin AI was similar to that by the other various agents , such as acidic ionophore and weak bases , which are known to increase in intralysosomal pH . The time course of increase in intralysosomal pH by 1 p ~ bafilomycin Ai in A431 cells labeled with FITC - dextrans was monitored by the spectrofluorometer . The pH gradually in - creased and reached maximum value ( about 6 . 0 ) after 50 min ( Fig . 4 ) . The intralysosomal pH of BNL CL . 2 cells also increased in a similar way after the addition of 1 pM bafilo - mycin Ai ( data not shown ) . Rafilomycin Ai Abolishes Cellular Degradation of " . " I - EGF - Epidermal growth factor is internalized into cells through receptor - mediated endocytosis , then degraded into low molec - ular weight products in lysosomes ( Carpenter , 1987 ) . It is interesting to see the effect of bafilomycin A , , because acidic pH of lysosomes may be important for the processes of deg - radation of EGF . Fig . 5 shows the effects of bafilomycin AI on degradation of " " I - EGF in the BNL CL . 2 and A431 cells . After incubation at 4 " C with " " I - EGF , both cells degraded about 80 % of the cell surface - bound ' " ' I - EGF at 37 " C and _ . . . 5 . 75 - 5 . 50 - 4 . 500 1111111 . .

Values were corrected for autoluminescence of the cells measured in the cells not exposed to FITC - dextran , and pH was calculated from the stand - ard curve . 2 * o p " p 7 1 60 .

After preincuhation in the serum - free medium , HNI , CL . 2 ( pnnrl A ) and A431 ( pond H ) cells were incu - hated with " " I - EGF at 4 " C for 2 h . Then the unhound ligand was removed by several washings , and the cells were incuhated at : l7 " C for the indicated time in the ahsence ( only Me , SO ) ( 0 ) or the presence of 1 p ~ bafilomvcin A , ( 0 ) . Degradation of ' " ' I - EGF internalized into the cells was measured as described under " Experimental Proce - dures . " Values were corrected by suhtracting the values at time 0 . Effects of Bafilomycin on Lysosomal Functions 17711 released acid - soluble low molecular weight products to the medium within 4 h ( Fig . 5 , A and B , open circles ) . When 1 p ~ bafilomycin A1 was added to the incubation medium , degra - dation of ' " I - EGF was completely abolished ( Fig . 5 , A and B , closed circles ) . A431 cells are known to overexpress EGF receptor ( Carpenter , 1987 ) . In fact , A431 cells degraded about 10 times as much ' * ' I - EGF as BNL CL . 2 cells . The inhibition by bafilomycin A1 was complete even in A431 cells , and almost 100 % of the radioactivities associated with both cells were in acid - insoluble forms even after incubation for 4 h . Thus the inhibition of the degradation by bafilomycin A1 was not due to an inhibition of a release of degraded Iz5I - EGF . Bafilomycin A , Does Not Inhibit Endocytosis of lZ5I - EGF - In order to know which step in the process of endocytosis and degradation of EGF was inhibited by bafilomycin Al , first , internalization of lZ5I - EGF into BNL CL . 2 cells was chased under the presence of 1 p ~ bafilomycin A1 . As shown in Fig . 6 , the cell surface - bound T - E G F was rapidly internalized into the cells independently whether bafilomycin A1 was added or not . The decrease in lZ5I - EGF within the cells , which appeared at 45 min in the absence of bafilomycin A , , may reflect the release of degraded lZ51 - EGF . Next , delivery of internalized EGF to lysosomes was inves - tigated by immuno - gold electron microscopy using mono - clonal anti - EGF antibody . When EGF was bound to the surface of A431 cells at 4 " C , then internalized at 37 " C for 30 min , gold particles were detected in lysosome - like multive - sicular bodies ( Fig . 7A ) , whereas after incubation for 5 min at 37 " C , gold particles were distributed on the plasma mem - brane ( data not shown ) . Similar results were obtained when 1 MM bafilomycin A , was added to the medium at the 37 " C incubation ( Fig . 7B ) . This compartment in which EGF was localized was determined to be lysosomes by the double - staining method using anti - EGF and anti - cathepsin B anti - bodies ( Fig . 7 , C and D ) . Irrespective of the addition of 1 p ~ bafilomycin A , , the endocytosed EGF was co - localized with cathepsin B , which is a representative lysosomal marker enzyme . Morphology of lysosomes was not altered by the bafilomycin A , treatment . Thus , bafilomycin A , does not appear to affect the endocytic pathway of EGF to lysosomes . These results suggest strongly that the arrest of degradation of lZ51 - EGF by bafilomycin A1 is closely related to the increase in the intralysosomal pH . DISCUSSION We have investigated effects of a specific V - ATPase inhib - itor , bafilomycin A1 , on the acidification and digestive func - tion of lysosomes in uiuo . This drug strongly inhibited the Time ( mid FIG . 6 . Internalization of lZ5I - EGF into the cells . " ' I - EGF was bound to the cell surface of BNL CL . 2 cells at 4 " C and internal - ized into the cells at 37 " C as described in Fig . 5 . " ' I - EGF bound to the cell surface ( circles ) and " ' I - EGF internalized into the cells ( triangles ) were measured in the absence ( only Me , SO ) ( open symbols ) or the presence ( closed symbols ) of 1 FM bafilomycin AI ( see " Exper - imental Procedures " ) . acidification of lysosomes and increased the intralysosomal pH in the two cell lines , BNL CL . 2 and A431 cells . Further - more , it abolished lysosomal degradation of endocytosed EGF completely , whereas the reagent did not affect internalization of EGF and its transport into the lysosomes . These results suggest strongly that proton - translocating activity of V - AT - Pases is actually essential for the lysosomal function , such as EGF digestions , through maintaining the luminal acidic en - vironment of the organelles . The specificity and useful properties of bafilomycin A1 have been demonstrated mainly by in vitro experiments ( Bowman et al . , 1988 ; Moriyama and Nelson , 1989a ; Hanada et al . , 1990 ; Moriyama and Futai , 1990 ) . There have been only a few reports using the drug against living cells . Klionsky and Emr ( 1989 ) showed partial missorting of a vacuolar protein oc - curred after treatment with a high concentration ( 10 pM ) of bafilomycin AI . Bafilomycin Al obviously inhibited bone re - sorption by osteoclasts , although the effective site was not identified ( Sundquist et al . , 1990 ) . Cell - killing action of diph - theria toxin on monkey kidney cells was inhibited by bafilo - mycin A1 at the step of toxin penetration from endosomes to cytosol ( Umata et al . , 1990 ) . It is now confirmed by the present results that bafilomycin A , is a useful inhibitor for the inves - tigation of V - ATPases in intracellular organelles in living cells . Abnormal morphology of the cells and the organelles was not observed when bafilomycin A1 was used at a concentration of 1 p ~ . Intracellular protein transport , including the endo - cytotic pathway , appeared not to be inhibited by the bafilo - mycin A , treatment ( Figs . 4 and 5 ) . Furthermore , bafilomycin AI did not perturb bulk secretions of proteins from the two cell lines derived from rat hepatoma and pituitary , respec - tively . ' These results gave credence to use of the reagent in living cells to inhibit specifically V - ATPases . It is notable that the increase in intralysosomal pH by bafilomycin A1 is limited to about 6 . 3 . Addition of amines or ionophores also increases the pH to about 6 . 0 - 6 . 5 ( Ohkuma and Poole ( 1978 ) and our results shown in Table 11 ) . On the other hand , the degradation of EGF was completely inhibited by bafilomycin A , , in spite of the fact that several proteolytic enzymes in lysosomes have been reported to have optimal pH near 6 in vitro ( Barrett , 1972 ) . One possibility is that EGF is a specific substrate for a particular hydrolase ( s ) , which is inactive at pH 6 . 0 . However , this possibility is unlikely be - cause overall degradation of endogenous proteins was also markedly inhibited by bafilomycin A , . ' Perhaps the optimum pH for the enzymes in active lysosomes within living cells may differ from those assayed in vitro as the isolated form , or there may be some regulation systems for the function of the lysosomal enzymes in lysosomes in vivo , which are sensitive to small changes in intralysosomal pH . The importance of acidification in the functions of lyso - somes and other organelles in the central vacuolar system has been suggested mainly based upon indirect evidence ( for re - view , see Mellman et al . ( 1986 ) ) , using acidotropic weak bases ( Holtzman , 1989 ) , and no direct approaches to physiological roles of V - ATPases have been reported . We showed that the effect of bafilomycin A1 may be limited strictly to the inhibi - tion of V - ATPase activity . The complete abolishment of the degradation of EGF by the drug suggests that the acidification of the lysosomes is essential for the activation of lysosomal hydrolases . Now we have established that bafilomycin Al could be a very strong tool for studying the roles of V - ATPases in lysosomes within living cells . ' T . Yoshimori , A . Yamamoto , Y . Moriyama , M .
