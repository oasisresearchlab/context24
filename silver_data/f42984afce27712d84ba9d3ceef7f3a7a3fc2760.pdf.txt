K . The mammalian - infective bloodstream form of Trypanosoma brucei possesses a highly active endocytotic system . Evasion of the host immune response by T . brucei is dependent on antigenic variation of VSG ( variant surface glycoprotein ) , but additional mechanisms for removal of surface - bound antibody also operate . Four Rab proteins , Tb ( trypanosomal ) RAB4 , 5A , 5B and 11 are located to the endosomal system ; TbRAB5A and TbRAB11 co - localize with internalized anti - VSG antibody and transferrin . A live cell assay was used to record a single cycle of endocytosis of anti - VSG IgG and transferrin , their subsequent degradation within the endosomal system and exocytosis of the products . TbRAB5A and TbRAB11 were involved in the overall process of endocytosis , degradation and exocytosis , whereas TbRAB5B and TbRAB4 were not implicated . The kinetics of anti - VSG IgG and transferrin recycling depend on the nucleotide state of TbRAB5A and TbRAB11 . These data , together with previous work , suggest that IgG and transferrin initially enter a TbRAB5A sorting endosome and are most probably recycled subsequently via a TbRAB11 - dependent step . Analysis of the recycled IgG and transferrin demonstrated extensive degradation of these recycled proteins . Degradation of transferrin was enhanced in cells expressing increased amounts of TbRAB5A or TbRAB11 with a Ser → Asn mutation , but was decreased when active TbRAB11 was overexpressed . The extent of degradation of anti - VSG IgG was found to be unaffected by mutant Rab protein expression . The presence of an efﬁcient mechanism for the removal of IgG bound to the external surface of T . brucei and its subsequent proteolysis within the recycling system suggests a role for this pathway in immune evasion . Key words : antibody , endocytosis , Rab protein , small G protein , Trypanosoma , variant surface glycoprotein , vesicle trafﬁcking . INTRODUCTION Evasion of the host immune response is a critical component of the survival strategy of any pathogen . Numerous mechanisms to achieve this evasion have been exploited by prokaryotic and eukaryotic pathogens and include sequestration , modulation of immune mechanisms and antigenic variation [ 1 – 5 ] . In the case of the protozoan parasite , Trypanosoma brucei , the predominant mechanism is antigenic variation . This organism expresses approx . 10 7 copies of the GPI ( glycosylphosphatidylinositol ) - anchored VSG ( variant surface glycoprotein ) on the external surface of the plasma membrane [ 6 ] , which are proposed to act primarily as a steric barrier preventing antibody and complement binding to invariant surface determinants [ 5 ] . VSG is highly immunogenic , and a robust anti - VSG immune response can eliminate parasites from the bloodstream with high efﬁciency , but rapid switching of the expressed VSG gene to an immunologically non - cross reactive VSG results in chronic infection [ 4 ] . This process may be assisted by immunomodulatory mechanisms [ 7 ] . VSG is capable of rapid endocytosis and recycling ; the protein has a long half - life and is neither shed nor subject to signiﬁcant endogenous degradation [ 8 ] . Anti - VSG immunoglobulin bound to the surface of living parasites in in vitro cultures is rapidly internalized and degraded , whereas the stability of the VSG is unaltered [ 9 ] . Clearly , this process has the potential to prevent antibody - dependent destruction of trypanosomes during the immune response , and to be an important adjunct to antigenic variation .

The bloodstream form of T . brucei has an elevated level of endocytic activity compared with the insect form . This differen - tial endocytic activity is unlikely to reﬂect an increased nutrient requirement in the bloodstream form because trypanosomes in both stages of the life cycle have similar replication times when measured during culture in vitro . Nevertheless , the bloodstream form does have an increased rate of accumulation of one essen - tial nutrient , low density lipoprotein , compared with the procyclic form [ 10 , 11 ] , as well as a specialized GPI - anchored receptor for endocytosis of host TF ( transferrin ) [ 12 ] that is not expressed in the procyclic form . TF is degraded , but the precise compartment where proteolysis takes place has not been deﬁned [ 12 , 13 ] . Several distinct compartments within the endosomal system of trypanosomes have been described . These ﬁndings were based on the immunolocalization of several Rab GTPases , which are central components of vesicle transport systems . In particular , the bloodstream stage expresses two distinct TbRAB5 ( trypanosomal RAB5 ) proteins that accompany ﬂuid phase and receptor - mediated endocytic cargo , and are likely to be restricted in loc - alization to early / sorting endosomes [ 11 ] . In addition , TbRAB11 and TbRAB4 , both of which have homologues in higher eukaryotes , act within pathways that are responsible for recycling membrane proteins [ 14 – 17 ] . TbRAB5A and TbRAB5B proteins are constitutively expressed , but in the procyclic form they co - localize , whereas in the bloodstream form they display separate localizations and appear to mediate transport of distinct cargo sets . Speciﬁcally , TbRAB5A mediates trafﬁcking of GPI - anchored VSG and the TF - receptor , whilst TbRAB5B mediates the c (cid:2) 2003 Biochemical Society 444 A . Pal and others trafﬁcking of ISG ( invariant surface glycoprotein ) 100 [ 11 , 17 ] . Moreover , TbRAB11 is strongly upregulated in bloodstream stages , and partially co - localizes with TbRAB5A , VSG and the TF - receptor , suggesting that it may play a general role in recycling ligands . Using a novel live - cell assay to monitor endocytosis and recycling of anti - VSG IgG and TF , TbRAB5A and TbRAB11 , but not TbRAB4 and TbRAB5B , are implicated as important components of the recycling system . MATERIALS AND METHODS Culture of bloodstream forms of T . brucei Bloodstream forms of T . brucei MITat 1 . 2 , derived from Lister strain 427 and expressing VSG 221 , were cultured in HMI - 9 me - dium , at 37 ◦ C at 5 % CO 2 in medical ﬂats ( Corning ) in a humid at - mosphere . Continued expression of the 221 VSG was checked periodically by immunoﬂuorescence , and always approached 100 % . Trypanosomes were maintained at densities between 10 5 and 5 × 10 6 cells / ml . Mutant trypanosomes were maintained in HMI - 9 selection medium with 2 . 5 µ g G418 or phleomycin ( Gibco ) as appropriate . Generation of mutant trypanosomes Cell lines were derived by transfection of various TbRAB ORFs ( open reading frames ) using the pXS519 plasmid ( targeted to the tubulin locus on chromosome I ) , as described previously [ 11 ] . Following the transfection procedure , cultures were expanded in 24 - well plates and cloned by limiting dilution as required . Inte - gration and expression of the ectopic copy of the recombinant mutant Rab gene was veriﬁed by PCR [ 11 ] from genomic DNA using the primers 3pXS519 ( 5 (cid:3) - GGGAAAAGCCAACTAAAT - CGGC - 3 (cid:3) ) and 5pXS519 ( 5 (cid:3) - CGAAAGGGCACATCGGCAC - GC - 3 (cid:3) ) and by Western blot analysis . Silent restriction sites were introduced into the mutagenized TbRAB ORFs to facilitate veriﬁcation that the correct construct had been integrated ( see below and [ 11 ] ) . Construction of mutant TbRAB isoforms and production of antibodies Construction of the TbRAB5A and TbRAB5B mutants and pro - duction of rabbit polyclonal antibodies against these proteins have been described previously [ 11 ] . Rabbit anti - TbRAB11 anti - body has also been described previously [ 16 ] . For TbRAB4 , the complete ORF was ampliﬁed with the primers 5 (cid:3) - CGGAGGAT - CCCAACCATGTCAGAGAGATATC - 3 (cid:3) and 5 (cid:3) - GTGGAATTC - AAATACCTAACAAGCACACG - 3 (cid:3) . The product was digested with Bam HI and Eco RI and inserted into pGEX - 3X ( Amersham Biosciences ) . Polyclonal murine and rabbit antibodies were raised against afﬁnity puriﬁed TbRAB4 - GST ( glutathione S - transferase ) fusion protein expressed in E . coli , using RIBI ( Sigma ) as adjuvant and a minimum of four immunizations [ 15 ] . All antibodies were checked for cross - reactivity against a range of non - cognate TbRABs and by competition with the cognate TbRAB ; in no case was cross - reactivity detected , and cognate competition was always achieved conﬁrming speciﬁcity of the antibodies ( results not shown ) . TbRAB4 WT ( wild - type protein ) was ampliﬁed from genomic DNA using the primers 5 (cid:3) - CGGAAAGCTTCAACC - ATGTCAGAGAG - 3 (cid:3) and 5 (cid:3) - TTTGGATCCAATACCTAACAA - GC - 3 (cid:3) . The TbRAB4 SN ( Ser → Asn ) mutation was introduced with the primers 5 (cid:3) - CGGAAAGCTTCAACCATGTCAGAGAG - ATATCAACAGTTAATGAAGTTAATTGTTGTTGGAGATAG - CGGCACAGGTAAAAATTCTC - 3 (cid:3) and 5 (cid:3) - TTTGGATCCAA - TACCTAACAAGC - 3 (cid:3) . The TbRAB4 QL ( Gln → Leu ) mutant was prepared using the primers 5 (cid:3) - CCGGTCTAGAAAGATACAAA - TCAG - 3 (cid:3) and CTGATTTGTATCTTTCTAGACCGGC - 3 (cid:3) . PCR products were cut with Bam HI and Hin dIII and inserted into pXS219 vector and then subcloned into pUB39 . The pUB39 construct was transfected into BF4 cells ( trypanosome blood - stream - form cell line harbouring inducible T7 ) and selected with 2 . 5 µ g / ml phleomycin in the presence of 1 µ g / ml tetracycline [ 18 ] . The TbRAB11 ORF was ampliﬁed using the primers 5 (cid:3) - ATG - AATTCCTTATTCTTTGATGAAGCCAAG - 3 (cid:3) and 5 (cid:3) - ATACCC - GGGTTAACAGCACCCGCCACTCGC - 3 (cid:3) , and then ligated into pBluescript . The SN and QL mutants were generated by megaprimer PCR . The primers 5 (cid:3) - CCAAAGCTTATGGAAGA - CATGAACCTTACG - 3 (cid:3) and 5 (cid:3) - GTAGCGAGTCATGAGGGAA - TTCTTCCCAACACCGCT - 3 (cid:3) , were used to generate an S21N / N22S double point mutation PCR product within the portion of the recombinant gene encoding the N - terminal region of TbRAB11 . This PCR product was then used as a megaprimer in a second PCR , employing 5 (cid:3) - TCTGTCATGAATTCGTTAA - CAGCACCCGCCACT - 3 (cid:3) to regenerate the entire ORF , which was then cloned into pXS519 . Similarly , TbRAB11 Q66L was made by producing a mutagenic megaprimer with 5 (cid:3) - CCAAAGCTT - ATGGAAGACATGAACCTTACG - 3 (cid:3) and 5 (cid:3) - GCGGAAACGTT - CTAGACCAGCGGTATCCCA - 3 (cid:3) , followed by reconstruction of the ORF in a PCR using the megaprimer and 5 (cid:3) - TCTGTCA - TGAATTCGTTAACAGCACCCGCCACT - 3 (cid:3) , and subcloning into pXS519 . All mutant TbRABs were veriﬁed by DyeDeoxy sequencing using BigDye terminator chemistry on a 377 DNA sequencer ( Applied Biosystems Inc . ) . FITC - labelled probes Polyclonal rabbit IgG anti - VSG 221 from T . brucei ( MITat 1 . 2 ) was raised and puriﬁed as described previously [ 9 ] . IgG and bovine holotransferrin ( Sigma ) were covalently coupled to ﬂuor - escein isothiocyanate by standard methods and the labelled pro - teins separated from the reaction mixture by gel ﬁltration on Sephadex G - 25 . The yield and ﬂuorescein : protein molar ratio were determined by a standard method based on the absorbance of both the protein and the attached ﬂuorescent probe , employing a correction for the contribution of the probe absorbance to that of the protein as described previously [ 19 , 20 ] . Continuous ﬂuorescence single turnover assay Full details of the derivation of the method can be obtained from H . P . Voorheis , Department of Biochemistry Trinity College , Dublin , Ireland . Unless otherwise mentioned , all manipulations were carried out on ice ( < 4 ◦ C ) . Cells were harvested from culture vessels , washed and resuspended in 5 ml of TES buf - fer [ N - tris ( hydroxymethyl ) methyl - 2 - aminoethanesulphonic acid buffered saline : 120 mM NaCl , 5 mM KCl , 3 mM MgSO 4 , 16 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 5 mM KH 2 PO 4 , 30 mM Tris , 10 mM glucose , 0 . 1 mM adenosine , pH 7 . 4 ] at 10 9 trypanosomes / ml at 0 ◦ C . A preliminary incubation of typically 2 × 10 8 cells was then conducted in TES buffer at 30 ◦ C for 15 min at a cell density of 10 7 cells / ml with stirring in order to allow any cycles of endocytosis – exocytosis of material derived from the culture medium to be completed . The incubation was terminated by diluting the suspension into a 4 - fold excess ( v / v ) of ice - cold TES , centrifuging and resuspending at 2 × 10 8 cells / ml in ice - cold TES and then incubating with FITC – IgG or FITC – TF ( ﬁnal c (cid:2) 2003 Biochemical Society Rab5 and Rab11 mediated recycling in Trypanosomabrucei 445 concentrations of 20 µ g / ml or 65 µ g / ml respectively ) for 30 min at 0 ◦ C to allow the IgG or TF to bind to the cell surface . After two washes with TES buffer at 0 ◦ C , the cells were resuspended in the same buffer at 0 ◦ C to obtain a ﬁnal stock cell suspension ( 2 × 10 9 cells / ml ) . An aliqout ( 60 µ l ) of this ﬁnal cell suspension was added to a stirred ﬂuorescence cuvette containing 3 ml of prewarmed isosmotic TES buffer . Fluorescence was recorded over a period of 1 – 2 h in an LS50B PerkinElmer ﬂuorimeter ( excitation wavelength , 476 nm ; emission wavelength , 515 nm ; both slit widths 5 nm ) . Data were sampled every 10 s in each of four cuvettes in parallel and recorded digitally with FL WinLab 5 . 0 ( PerkinElmer ) . Correction for differences in cell concentration between cuvettes was accomplished by determining the concen - tration of cell protein in each cuvette at the termination of the assay . Gel ﬁltration chromatography Following the completion of a single turnover experiment , using FITC - labelled anti - VSG IgG or FITC – TF , trypanosomes were centrifuged ( 20 min , 4000 g ) and the supernatant was ﬁltered through a 0 . 2 µ m ﬁlter and applied to a column ( 1 cm × 55 cm ) of Bio - Gel P - 2 . The FITC - labelled material in the supernatant was eluted ( 20 ◦ C , 0 . 3 ml / min ) from the column with TES buffer andcollectedin2 . 5 mlfractions . Theﬂuorescenceofeachfraction was determined with a PerkinElmer LS50Bﬂuorimeter . Data were normalized to the total ﬂuorescence for that experiment . FITC – TF and FITC – IgG eluted at the void volume , whereas proteolysed FITC – TF and FITC – IgG ( 3 µ g Pronase overnight at 37 ◦ C ) eluted with the total inclusion volume ( determined with cysteine ) . RESULTS Generation of mutant trypanosomes Many studies of Rab proteins in higher eukaryotes have demon - strated that a speciﬁc point mutation within the region of the GTP binding site ( WDTAGQE : Q → L ) results in a dominant active mutant protein which has dramatically reduced GTPase activity but retains afﬁnity for GTP . Also , a speciﬁc point mutation in the ﬁrst consensus GTP - binding region ( SVGK : S → N ) generates a dominant inactive protein with enhanced GDP - binding charac - teristics [ 21 – 23 ] . In the highly conserved GTP - binding regions of the TbRAB family , analogous mutations result in similar alter - ations to the GTP - TbRAB interaction , e . g . TbRAB5A , 5B [ 11 ] , TbRAB18 [ 24 ] , TbRAB31 and TbRAB2 ( M . C . Field and H . I . Field , unpublished work ) ; therefore this strategy is valid for trypanosomatid Rab proteins . The precise mechanism by which the mutations affect function in vivo is not completely clear , and is not conﬁned to direct competition with the endogenous form . For example , some GTPase SN mutants are believed to sequester speciﬁc exchange factors , responsible for downstream function [ 25 ] , and thereby effectively deplete the cell of wild - type Rab activity . The intracellular localization and expression proﬁles of TbRAB4 , 5A , 5B and 11 in bloodstream forms of T . brucei , as well as speciﬁc alterations to the endocytic behaviour of cells pos - sessing either a TbRAB5A or a TbRAB5B mutant background , have been reported previously [ 11 , 15 , 16 ] . Parasites expressing SN or QL recombinant mutant Rab proteins or overexpressing the wild - type protein for each of the TbRAB4 , 5A , 5B and 11 isoforms , from genomically integrated pXS519 or pUB39 , were obtained by electroporation , selection and cloning ( see the Table 1 Western blot analysis of TbRAB overexpression Boiling - SDSlysatespreparedfrombloodstream - formcellsexpressingectopiccopiesofvarious TbRAB proteins were fractionated by reducing SDS / PAGE , blotted on to nitrocellulose , and transferred protein was visualized by Ponceau S . TbRAB proteins were detected as described in the Materials and methods section by enhanced chemoluminescence . Data were quantiﬁed by densitometry using NIH Image , and loading normalized for total protein transferred by referencetoPonceauSstain .

Materials and methods section ) in all but one case . The TbRAB5A SN form could not be generated despite repeated at - tempts [ 11 ] . All of the other TbRAB5 isoforms were ectopically expressed to a level 4 – 10 - fold greater than the endogenous protein ( Table 1 ) . Genomic insertion of the plasmids encoding isoforms of TbRAB4 and TbRAB11 was veriﬁed by PCR ( results not shown ) . Quantitative Western blot analysis ( Table 1 ) conﬁrmed that overexpression of the TbRAB11 isoforms was of the order of 4 - fold compared with the endogenous protein , whereas expression of ectopic copies of TbRAB4 isoforms were either equal to the endogenous protein ( TbRAB4 SN mutant ) or more than 4 - fold higher ( all other mutant types of TbRAB4 ) . FITC - labelled anti - VSG IgG can be monitored as it progresses through the trypanosome endocytic pathway The endocytic compartments of bloodstream - form trypanosomes are typical low pH internal compartments [ 26 ] ; hence a pH - sensitive ﬂuorophore will exhibit altered emission characteristics as a function of its location . For ﬂuorescein , a decrease in emission can be correlated with endocytosis of the probe from the exterior of the cell into the endosomal system . A return to the initial ﬂuorescence level will result if the probe is subsequently recycled to the exterior of the cell . Endocytosed antibody can be detected in deﬁned endosomal compartments [ 11 , 15 ] , conﬁrming that immunoglobulin traverses the endosomal system of bloodstream form trypanosomes . Trypanosomes were allowed to bind FITC - labelled anti - VSG antibody at 0 ◦ C , washed to remove unbound antibody , and then allowed to endocytose in the absence of additional antibody in the supporting medium . Recorded ﬂuorescence varied over time in a highly reproducible manner ( Figure 1 ) . The initial emission dropped rapidly to a minimum at approx . 300 s , and was then followed by a rapid return to the initial ﬂuorescence at approx . 500 s ( Figure 1A ) . The ﬁnal ﬂuorescence intensity was substan - tially greater than the initial value at the beginning of the ex - periment . The overshoot is at least partly explained by proteolysis , c (cid:2) 2003 Biochemical Society 446 A .

For cellstreatedwithchloroquine ( 1 mM ) , theinhibitorwasaddedtothecuvetteimmediatelybefore adding cells . Representative traces from at least three replicates are shown . as protease treatment of FITC – IgG results in increased ﬂuor - escence ( results not shown ) . If cells are de - energized , by removal of glucose , or the internal pH of the endosomal compartments are raised by addition of chloroquine , these changes in ﬂuorescence are lost . This is consistent with the model that the ﬂuorophore traverses a low pH compartment during an energy - requiring transport process . To facilitate comparison between cell lines , several parameters to describe the time - dependent changes in ﬂuorescence were in - troduced . The time from the beginning of endocytosis to the return of the ﬂuorescence to its initial emission , (cid:1) t , was found to be highly reproducible ( Figure 2 ) . This parameter can serve as a crude measure of how rapidly a probe traverses a portion of the recycling pathway . (cid:1) t for MITat 1 . 2 cells for FITC anti – VSG was 8 . 83 + − 1 . 25 min . Further , the extent to which the ﬁnal emission exceeded the initial value can be expressed as P ( Figure 2 ) , the ratio of the ﬂuorescence interval between the ﬁnal emission level and the minimum ( (cid:1) f 2 ) to the initial emission and the minimum ( (cid:1) f 1 ) ( Figure 2 ) . The ratio P was also found to be highly re - producible . For MITat 1 . 2 , ratio P = 6 . 7 + − 0 . 7 . The molecular basis for this parameter is somewhat complex and depends in part on the degree of degradation of the probe whereas traversing Figure 2 Schematic ﬂuorescence time - course to illustrate derivation of parameters in Table 2 Following endocytosis of surface - bound ﬂuorescent ligand , ﬂuorescence decreases owing to the lower pH in endosomes / lysosomes . Fluorescence rises again as a combined result of the higher pH in recycling compartments plus a contribution from proteolysis of the protein probe . At the present time the relative contributions of these two factors are not known , and hence the parameters are simply comparative and do not make predictions concerning mechanism . (cid:1) tis the time from the beginning of endocytosis ( t = 0 ) to a point when ﬂuorescence reaches the initial value again ; delayed recycling is accompanied by increased (cid:1) t . (cid:1) f 1 is the difference between the initial ﬂuorescence and the minimum , (cid:1) f 2 is the difference between the ﬁnal level andtheminimum . Pistheratio (cid:1) f 2 / (cid:1) f 1 , andisameasureforhowmuchtheﬁnalﬂuorescence exceeds the initial value . For completely abrogated proteolysis , the ﬂuorescence is determined by pH only , and P = 1 . 0 . the endosomal system and most likely additional factors . Overall these data indicate that this approach is a valid method for investigation of recycling kinetics . Effect of expression of TbRAB4 , 5 and 11 mutant isoforms on recycling of FITC - labelled anti - VSG IgG The 11 TbRAB mutant clones were analysed using continuous ﬂuorescence assay under single - turnover conditions . Each group of mutants was analysed concurrently with the untransfected parental line . Analysis of the results obtained with the re - combinant mutant isoforms of TbRAB11 were striking . First , there was no signiﬁcant effect of the expression of any of the recombinant TbRAB11 isoforms on the rate of the endocytic portion of the recycling of FITC - labelled anti - VSG antibody present within the surface immune complexes of bloodstream forms of T . brucei ( Figure 3A ) . However , marked effects were observed on the rate of exocytosis of the internalized antibodies from the endosomal compartment to the external supporting me - dium . The TbRAB11 WT cells showed signiﬁcant acceleration of the exocytic rate compared with the parent ( Figure 3A ) , whereas dominant - active TbRAB11 QL cells were even faster in exocytosis than the wild - type overexpressor ( Figure 3A ) and the dominant - inactive Rab11 SN was markedly slowed in exocytosis compared with the parental cells . These data establish that the release of antibody from bloodstream form trypanosomes requires trafﬁck - ing in a TbRAB11 - dependent manner . The participation of TbRAB11 in vesicle trafﬁcking from the endosomal compartment to the plasma membrane is consistent with previous observations on the trafﬁcking of different cargo in other types of cells [ 27 ] and with observations on the location of TbRAB11 compared with internalized VSG antibody in trypanosomes [ 15 ] . None of the TbRAB4 mutant cells displayed any signiﬁcant alteration at any stage in the recycling of FITC - labelled anti - VSG IgG ( Figure 3B ) ; the observed rates of initial ﬂuorescence decrease and subsequent increase were identical to those of the c (cid:2) 2003 Biochemical Society Rab5 and Rab11 mediated recycling in Trypanosomabrucei 447 Table 2 Parameters for anti - VSG IgG and transferrin transport in TbRAB mutant trypanosome cells An overview of characteristic parameters obtained in continuous uptake assays , as explained in the legend to Figure 4 , is given .

This result is signiﬁcant for two reasons : ﬁrst , the data indicate that unlike many organisms where TbRAB4 is implicated in recycling of receptors , in bloodstream trypanosomes it does not play a signiﬁcant role in this process ( [ 28 ] and see below ) , and second , the data indicate that neither the genomic integration of a plasmid carrying a gene encoding a TbRAB isoform , nor its subsequent expression , interferes nonspeciﬁcally with endocytosis . The effects on the recycling of FITC - labelled anti - VSG IgG in mutant trypanosomes carrying recombinant isoforms of TbRAB5A and TbRAB5B were restricted to the exocytic phase of the cycle ( Figure 3C and 3D ) . However , signiﬁcant effects on recyclingwereobserved . Forexample , whenanyoftheTbRAB5B isoforms were expressed , the exocytic rate was slowed to the same relatively small extent ( Figure 3D ) , but when the TbRAB5A WT was overexpressed the decreased rate was more marked than with any of the TbRAB5B isotypes . When the dominant - active TbRAB5A QL isoform was expressed , the slowing of the exocytic phase was the greatest observed among all TbRAB5 isotypes and was comparable with that obtained with TbRAB11 SN . These data suggest that the rate of recycling is inversely proportional to the level of TbRAB5A / GTP . Expression of either of the dominant - active isotypes , TbRAB5A QL and TbRAB5B QL , or expression of the dominant - inactive isotype , TbRAB5B SN did not affect the entry rate . Con - sequently , either TbRAB5A and 5B are not signiﬁcantly involved in the entry of this cargo in T . brucei , or the inward - directed vesicle trafﬁcking system in T . brucei is already rate - limiting for an additional component , such that expression of the recombinant TbRAB5 isotypes is without observable impact . These data indicate that TbRAB11 and TbRAB5A are major factors in the recycling of anti - VSG IgG , and are fully consistent with our previous morphological work [ 11 , 15 , 16 ] . Figure 3 Effect of overexpression of TbRAB4 , TbRAB5A , TbRAB5B and TbRAB11 isoforms on endocytosis and recycling of anti - VSG IgG Bloodstream form trypanosomes were harvested from culture and prepared for the experiment , allowed to bind FITC - labelled anti - MITat 1 . 2 VSG IgG at 0 ◦ C and then incubated at 30 ◦ C in stirred ﬂuorescence cuvettes and ﬂuorescence changes recorded . Panels ( A – D ) show isoforms TbRAB11 , TbRAB4 , TbRAB5A and TbRAB5B respectively . In each case , wild - type parental cells areindicatedwithathicklineandothertraces ( WT , QLandSN ) areasindicated . Theexperiments wereperformedtwice ( TbRAB4 , TbRAB5B ) orthreetimes ( TbRAB5A , TbRAB11 ) withessentially identical results . Effect of expression of TbRAB4 , 5 and 11 mutant isoforms on recycling of FITC - labelled TF A similar experimental procedure was used to examine endo - cytosis and recycling of TF ( see the Materials and methods section ) . Again , a rapid decrease in ﬂuorescence was observed , followed by a return to the initial emission and an overshoot . Interestingly , the process was rather more rapid , with the ﬂuor - escence minimum being achieved at approx . 3 . 3 min , and the return to starting ﬂuorescence at > 6 . 67 min , overall approx . 1 . 4 - fold more rapid than IgG ( Figure 4 ) ; a typical value of 5 . 75 + − 0 . 55 min for (cid:1) t for MITat 1 . 2 was found . These more rapid kinetics may simply reﬂect the size of the molecule or the efﬁciency of passage , and do not necessarily imply a distinct route . In addition , whereas the ﬂuorescence in IgG experiments continued to rise , albeit slowly after 50 min ( see Figure 3 ) , for TF a clear plateau was obtained at 25 min , with a typical value for P of 6 . 8 for parental cells . Taken together , these data suggest that c (cid:2) 2003 Biochemical Society 448 A .

Panels ( A – D ) show isoforms TbRAB11 , TbRAB4 , TbRAB5A and TbRAB5B . In each case , wild - type parental cells are indicated with a thick line and other traces ( WT , QL and SN ) are as indicated . The experiments have been performed twice ( TbRAB4 , TbRAB5B , TbRAB11 ) or three times ( TbRAB5A ) with essentially identical results . a rather more rapid system for the recycling of TF is present in T . brucei than for IgG . This may , in part , be a reﬂection of the heterogeneity of polypeptides in polyclonal IgG compared with the homogenous TF . In the majority of cases , the data obtained for each of the mutant trypanosomes for FITC – TF were highly similar to those obtained with the respective cells for anti - VSG IgG transport . Overexpression of TbRAB11 WT and TbRAB11 QL selectively increased recycling of TF , whereas expression of TbRAB11 SN selectively decreased export of TF ( Figure 4A ) . Expression of recombinant TbRAB4 mutant isoforms was without any detect - able effects ( Figure 4B ) . Trypanosomes expressing either the dominant - active TbRAB5A QL and TbRAB5A WT isoforms also led to a selective decrease of the export of internalized TF ( Figure 4C ) . Three signiﬁcant differences between the effects of the TbRAB mutants on TF and anti - VSG IgG transport were detected . First , whereas ectopic expression of TbRAB5B isoforms was without a speciﬁc effect on recycling of TF ( see Figure 4D where all TbRAB5B mutants show a similar decrease on recycling ) , a small but detectable inﬂuence was seen on anti - VSG IgG transport . Secondly , expression of TbRAB5A QL , both slowed the export of internalized TF and led to an elevated ﬁnal level of ﬂuorescence ( Figure 4C ) . This result was obtained in three replicates of the experiment , using separately prepared batches of cells , and did not result from a greater level of proteolysis ( see below ) . Thirdly , the overall recycling rate for TF was approx . 1 . 4 times as fast as that observed for anti - VSG IgG ; this increase was due almost entirely to the faster recycling step and not to the uptake phase ( compare Figures 3 and 4 ) . IgG degradation is unaltered by TbRAB mutant expression Altered endocytosis and recycling kinetics could be expected to affect proteolytic processing of immunoglobulin . Hence , IgG that had been recycled , i . e . released into the supernatant , was analysed after 4000 s . The contents of the assay vessel were centrifuged to remove cells and the supernatant ( approx . 3 ml ) was loaded di - rectly onto a BioGel P2 column . Importantly , essentially no ﬂuor - escence was associated with the cells at this time ( results not shown ) . Previous studies have shown that 125 I - labelled IgG is extensively degraded [ 9 ] . For MITat 1 . 2 , gel permeation chromatograms revealed that the majority of ﬂuorescence ( > 65 % ) was associated with material eluting in the included volume , i . e . with a molecular mass of < 1800 Da . The centroid of the major peak corresponded to the total volume ( V t , calibrated with cysteine ) , and represents remarkably efﬁcient and essentially complete degradation of the antibody ( Figure 5 and results not shown ) . Hence , these data fully conﬁrm earlier observations that IgG is extensively degraded , and that the fragments are predominantly released from the cell . Signiﬁcantly , none of the trypanosome cell lines analysed displayed altered gel permeation proﬁles ( Table 3 ) . Hence , despite signiﬁcant effects on recycling rate , the TbRAB proteins did not affect the processing of endocytosed IgG . TF degradation is altered in TbRAB5A and TbRAB11 mutants When the recycled material from a TF – FITC experiment was sub - jected to gel permeation analysis , extensive degradation was also observed , in agreement with earlier work [ 13 ] . Further , this ma - terial also corresponded to > 90 % of ﬂuorescence recovered at the end of the experiment , indicating a substantial recycling and release of degraded TF by the parasite . In this case , digestion was more complete than for IgG , with only 15 % of ﬂuorescence associated with material in the void volume . Again , the major included peak corresponded to V t , suggesting essentially com - plete degradation ( Figure 5 ) . As with the kinetic analysis , neither TbRAB4 not TbRAB5B mutant backgrounds affected the size distribution of the recovered material , suggesting little effect on proteolytic degradation of TF ( Table 3 and Figure 5 ) . In contrast , TbRAB5A and TbRAB11 mutants did signiﬁcantly alter the state of recovered TF ; the TbRAB5A WT , 5A QL and 11 SN mutants exhibited increased degra - dation , whereas the TbRAB11 QL mutant demonstrated decreased degradation . In all cases , only the proportion of material recovered in the included peak was altered ( Figure 5 and Table 3 ) , but in no case was the peak position altered , indicating no gross change to the process . These data are consistent with the recycling rate , and suggest that for TF , the extent of degradation is proportional to the time within the recycling system . For example the TbRAB11 SN background has a reduced recycling rate , and hence TF spends a longer period within the endocytic system ; material recycled from these cells is more processed . c (cid:2) 2003 Biochemical Society Rab5 and Rab11 mediated recycling in Trypanosomabrucei 449 Figure 5 Effect of overexpression of TbRAB4 , TbRAB5A , TbRAB5B and TbRAB11 isoforms on the degradation of TF Following a round of endocytosis and recycling of TF , assays were terminated after 4000 s by centrifugation and the supernatants removed and chromatographed on a column of BioGel P2 .

DISCUSSION Our data provide new evidence for the receptor - mediated endo - cytosis of surface immune complexes in trypanosomes , as well as providing conﬁrmatory evidence for receptor - mediated endocytosis of TF [ 12 ] . These ligands have been demonstrated to enter acidic compartments that quench the ﬂuorescence of an attached ﬂuorescein probe . In addition , transit through the cell is energy dependent and leads to extensive internal proteolysis of both ligands . Proteolysis of IgG and TF was shown by increased ﬂuorescence of the proteolysed ligands and their altered molecular mass following release from the cell . The use of mutant Rab proteins has been of major value in determining the physiological role of Rabs in other cell systems . The approach is based upon the ability to make GTP - and GDP - locked forms of the proteins , with dominant effects over the endogenous Rab protein . Effects of the mutant TbRAB11 isoforms on ligand recycling are clear : both the wild - type over - Table 3 Inﬂuence of TbRAB proteins on degradation of IgG and transferrin in trypanosomes Data are taken from gel ﬁltration experiments on the supernatants from cells allowed to endocytose and recycle anti - MITat 1 . 2 VSG IgG ( results not shown ) and transferrin ( data from Figure 5 ) .

In addition , the dominant negative , TbRAB11 SN mutant had no effect on endocytosis but did slow the recycling portion of the cycle . These results agree with previous data , where TbRAB11 co - localized with both internalized anti - VSG IgG and with TF [ 11 , 15 , 29 ] , and also with similar ﬁndings in mammalian cells where Rab11 acts on receptor - mediated endocytosis and recycling , including TF [ 27 , 30 , 31 ] . No inﬂuence was found for mutant TbRAB4 on ligand recycling , which is distinct from the mammalian system where Rab4 acts on receptor recycling and ligand recycling [ 32 ] . The effects of TbRAB5 on ligand cycling in bloodstream form T . brucei are more complex . Expression of TbRAB5B mutants slowed recycling but did not affect the endocytic part of anti - VSG IgG cycling , whereas their effects on TF recycling were much reduced or absent . The observation that TbRAB5A QL decreases the recycling rate is consistent with observations that TbRAB5A QL leads to moderately swollen endosomes [ 11 ] ; an increased volume of these compartments would be expected to decrease the efﬁciency of exit of cargo from the early endosome , and hence slow the overall recycling rate . The mechanism for the small continuous increase in the ﬁnal ﬂuorescence of the material derived from FITC - labelled TF following transit through cells that express TbRAB5A QL , is not yet clear , but is matched by an increase in the degradation of this material as assessed by gel ﬁltration . In mammalian cells Rab5 proteins are thought to be involved either close to or actually in the endocytic step and certainly act before Rab11 [ 22 ] . Overexpression of either the wild - type or QL isoform of TbRAB5A has no detectable effect on endocytosis of low density lipoprotein in the bloodstream form of the parasite , but does have a profound effect in the procyclic stage , where basal levels of endocytic activity are at least an order of magnitude lower [ 11 ] . It is possible that the level of endocytosis in the bloodstream form is so rapid , that a critical component is rate - limiting , with the consequence that it may be impossible to stimulate the process c (cid:2) 2003 Biochemical Society 450 A . Pal and others further . In addition , the mechanism of endocytosis itself may differ substantially in the trypanosome from that described for higher eukaryotes , as the AP - 2 ( activator protein 2 ) complex appears absent from the genome , and GPI - anchored proteins are endocytosed via a clathrin - mediated pathway [ 14 , 33 ] . The ﬂuorescein - tagged peptides derived from both TF and anti - VSG IgG were extensively degraded inside an endosomal compartment in the parent strain . The extent of proteolysis of IgG was unaffected by mutant TbRAB expression , but proteolysis of TF was increased by the expression of the mutant TbRABs ( TbRAB11 SN , TbRAB5A QL , TbRAB5A WT ) thatslowedtheoverall recycling of TF . In addition , TF proteolysis was decreased by the expression of TbRAB11 QL , which accelerated recycling . The most probable reason for these effects is an increase or decrease in residence time of the ligand in the endosomal compartment , leading to an equivalent change in exposure time to the proteolytic activities responsible for degradation . The lack of a similar effect onIgGcouldbeduetodifferencesinthepathwaytakenbyIgGandTF , or that TF and IgG signiﬁcantly differ in protease sensitivities . The ﬁrst possibility is supported by observations here that the tran - sit time for TF through the endosome is signiﬁcantly shorter than that for anti - VSG IgG . A role for TF recycling via the endocytic system is well es - tablished as a mechanism for the nutritional uptake of iron [ 12 ] , but the idea that recycling surface immune complexes play a role in the trypanosome life cycle is relatively new [ 9 ] . It is well established that antigenic variation is the major mechanism by which the African trypanosome avoids host immune defences . Endosomal recycling of surface immune complexes may con - tribute to the parasite defence repertoire against host antibody response , and is based on two recent ﬁndings . First , that blood - stream form trypanosomes can escape from antibody - mediated aggregates without injury and then remain competent to grow and divide at an undiminished rate [ 9 ] , and second , the ﬁndings in the present study , which demonstrate that surface immune complexes can be endocytosed and the surface immunoglobulins degraded within the endosomal system . Many trypanosomes found in more primitive vertebrates than mammals , for example in ﬁsh , appear to lack a VSG and yet their infections in these hosts persist for many days , and even as long as several months [ 34 ] . The clearance mechanism for surface immune complexes may have arisen as an early evolutionary defence mechanism for the parasite , appearing before the advent of antigenic variation .
