Stomatal movement is a response to many internal and external stimuli to increase adaptability to environmental change . The cytoskeleton , including actin filaments and microtubules , is highly dynamic in guard cells during stomatal movement , and the destruction of the cytoskeleton interferes with stomatal movement . In this review , we discuss recent progress on the organization and dynamics of actin filaments and microtubule network in guard cells , and we pay special attention to cytoskeletal - associated protein - mediated cytoskeletal rearrangements during stomatal movement . We also discuss the potential mechanisms of stomatal movement in relation to the cytoskeleton and attempt to provide a foundation for further research in this field . Keywords : stomatal movement , actin filament , microtubule , actin - binding proteins , microtubule - associated proteins INTRODUCTION The plant leaf epidermis and cuticle protect water against transpiration in relatively dry terrestrial environments but also limit gas exchange with the external environment for photosynthesis . Plants have evolved stomata on the leaf and stem epidermis ; these structures consist of two kidney - shaped or dumbbell - shaped guard cells and are responsible for 95 % gas exchange between the external atmosphere and the interior of the leaf ( Keenan et al . , 2013 ; Lawson and Matthews , 2020 ) . Furthermore , stomata provide major sites for pathogen entry ( Gudesblat et al . , 2009 ; Zeng et al . , 2010 ; Melotto et al . , 2017 ) . Plants are able to adjust stomatal opening and closure in response to environmental changes ( Hetherington and Woodward , 2003 ; Murata et al . , 2015 ) . Hence , an attractive research system for investigations of signal transduction and physiological responses has been developed on the basis of stomatal functions . The key factor driving stomatal movement is the turgor pressure change provoked by ions and water across plasma and vacuolar membranes , giving rise to swelling or deflation of the cells and opening or closing of the pores ( Kollist et al . , 2014 ; Woolfenden et al . , 2018 ; Lawson and Matthews , 2020 ) . In recent decades , a series of ion channels and transporters and their upstream regulators fine - tuning osmotic pressure in guard cells have been identified ( Kollist et al . , 2014 ; Lawson and Matthews , 2020 ) . The activities of these channels and transporters depend on voltage sensing , ligand binding , or protein posttranslational modification . For example , the H + - ATPase Li et al . Cytoskeleton in Stomatal Movement Frontiers in Plant Science | www . frontiersin . org 2 February 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 849729 AHA1 is activated by blue light , which leads to hyperpolarization of the plasma membrane in guard cells ( Kinoshita and Shimazaki , 1999 ; Kinoshita et al . , 2001 ; Hayashi et al . , 2011 ) . The change in membrane potential drives K + influx through KAT1 / 2voltage - gated K + channels , accompanied by anion Cl − and malate influx ( Lebaudy et al . , 2010 ; Yamauchi et al . , 2016 ) . Increased levels of osmotically active substances further increase water uptake , resulting in the inflation of guard cells and stomatal opening . Emerging studies provide evidences indicating that the cytoskeleton , including actin filaments ( AFs ) and microtubules ( MTs ) , is considered as an important factor involved in stomatal movement , possibly via affecting turgor pressure in guard cells ( Zhang and Fan , 2009 ; Khanna et al . , 2014 ) . The cytoskeleton participates in cell division and cell wall synthesis , which affect guard cell shape , structure , and mechanics ( Galatis and Apostolakos , 2004 ; Panteris et al . , 2018 ; Woolfenden et al . , 2018 ; Muroyama et al . , 2020 ) . MTs guide cellulose synthesis complexes and determine cellulose microfibril orientation , which might provide high tensile strength in guard cells during stomatal movement ( Woolfenden et al . , 2018 ) . On the other hand , the cytoskeleton undergoes rapid dynamic changes during stomatal movement , and stomatal movement is inhibited in cytoskeleton - deficient plants . In this review , we discuss current knowledge of cytoskeletal dynamics and their regulation in guard cells and aim to provide novel insights into the mechanisms of cytoskeleton - dependent stomatal movement . DYNAMICS AND FUNCTIONS OF ACTIN FILAMENTS IN GUARD CELLS Pharmacological inhibitors are commonly used to study the dynamics and functions of cytoskeleton and have demonstrated a prerequisite for actin remodeling in stomatal movement . Treatment with the AF stabilizers , such as phalloidin or jasplakinolide , inhibits stomatal closure induced by ABA , H 2 O 2 , and darkness , and phalloidin ( but not jasplakinolide ) also inhibited light - induced stomatal opening ( Kim et al . , 1995 ; MacRobbie and Kurup , 2007 ; Li et al . , 2014 ) . In contrast , the application of the AF - depolymerizing agent latrunculin B ( but not cytochalasin B or D ) accelerates ABA - induced stomatal closure , whereas cytochalasin B and D facilitate light - induced stomatal opening ( Kim et al . , 1995 ; MacRobbie and Kurup , 2007 ) . The different effects of phalloidin versus jasplakinolide treatment and latrunculin B versus cytochalasin treatment may be due to the different mechanisms on AFs of these drugs and different drug sensitivity for plant materials . For example , latrunculin B binds to actin monomers and cytochalasin D binds to the barbed end of AF to inhibit AF polymerization . Nevertheless , these pharmacological experiments support the necessity of AFs in both stomatal opening and closing . The interconversion and configurations of AFs are highly correlated with the movement of stomatal aperture . Based on orientation , bundling and density , AF configurations in guard cells have been classified into three types during stomatal movement : ( 1 ) “radial arrays” or “radial bundles” : sparse AFs or bundles are distributed radially from stomatal pores in three - dimensional projection images , and actually cortical AFs are arranged in a circular pattern in cross - sections ; ( 2 ) “random meshwork” : AFs are randomly distributed and organized into mesh - like networks with a high density ; and ( 3 ) “longitudinal arrays” : most AFs form long bundles aligned in the longitudinal direction in guard cells ( Gao et al . , 2008 ; Higaki et al . , 2010 ; Li et al . , 2014 ; Shimono et al . , 2016 ; Isner et al . , 2017 ) . In general , radial array and radial bundle configurations are more likely to be present in open stomata ; filaments are reorganized into promiscuous mesh - like arrangements in the transition state ; and longitudinal array configurations are dominant in closed stomata ( Higaki et al . , 2010 ; Shimono et al . , 2016 ) . Consistently , live - cell imaging of AF configurations in stomatal apertures revealed that AF remodeling during stomatal movement can be summarized as follows : the cortical radial AFs in open stomata first disassemble and are randomly distributed in response to environmental or endogenous signals , followed by reassembly into long bundles that are parallel to the long axis of guard cells , leading to stomatal closure . By observing AF behaviors in guard cells in the early stage of stomatal closure induced by the bacterial flagellin peptide flg22 at the single - filament level , Zou et al . observed that the AF - bundling frequency decreased while the severing frequency increased , which contributed to rapid AF disassembly ( Zou et al . , 2021 ) . Cotreatment with phalloidin inhibits ABA or darkness - induced stomatal closure , supporting the notion that AF disassembly may be a critical step for initializing stomatal closure ( Gao et al . , 2008 ) . AF dynamics is important factor regulating the activity of ion channels and NADPH oxidase at the membrane that participates in stomata movement . A study in cytochalasin D - treated guard cells evaluated the activity of plasma membrane - localized osmo - sensitive voltage - dependent inward K + channels and Ca 2 + - permeable channels at the single - channel level and found that the whole - cell current was increased ( Hwang et al . , 1997 ; Liu and Luan , 1998 ; Zhang and Fan , 2009 ) . In contrast , AF stabilizer phalloidin treatment restrained inward whole - cell Ca 2 + current ( Zhang and Fan , 2009 ) . Latrunculin B treatment enhances the vacuolar efflux transient induced by 10 μ M ABA ( Ca 2 + influx rather than internal Ca 2 + release at this concentration of ABA ) but inhibits that induced by 0 . 1 μ M ABA ( triggering internal Ca 2 + release rather than Ca 2 + influx ) , indicating that AFs also regulate vacuolar ion efflux transient ( MacRobbie and Kurup , 2007 ) . The depolymerization of AFs by latrunculin B also enhances ABA - induced H 2 O 2 production through increasing the activity of plasma membrane - localized NADPH oxidase RbohD ( Li et al . , 2014 ) . Whereas it is still poorly understood how the activity of these proteins is influenced by AF turnover , several possible mechanisms could be tested . A tethering model has been proposed in mammalian cells and Drosophila , where the channel is gated by tethering to the cytoskeleton for mechanosensing ( Jiang et al . , 2021 ) . For examples , AFs tether Piezo channels in mammalian cells and MTs tether NOMPC channels ( belonging to the TRP family ) in Drosophila for mechanogating ( Zhang et al . , 2015 ; Wang et al . , 2020 ) . Whether a similar mechanism whereby the cytoskeleton directly controls the activity of ion channels is conserved in guard cells still awaits further investigation . The distribution patterns and dynamic properties are also critical for membrane protein function . A recent study revealed that AFs and MTs participate in the dynamics of the aquaporin AtPIP2 ; 1 at the plasma membrane during flg22 - induced stomatal closure . Lat B treatment promotes the aggregation Li et al . Cytoskeleton in Stomatal Movement Frontiers in Plant Science | www . frontiersin . org 3 February 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 849729 of AtPIP2 ; 1 at the plasma membrane and accelerates water loss in response to flg22 ( Cui et al . , 2021 ) . This study provides a new point of view on the activity of plasma membrane proteins regulated by the cytoskeleton . Vacuoles play a critical role in the regulation of turgor pressure in guard cells . Large vacuoles invaginate to form transvascular strands in opened stomata and split into small vacuoles during stomatal closure , which contributes to changes in the volume of guard cells and the excessive storage of membrane materials ( Gao et al . , 2005 ; Tanaka et al . , 2007 ; Yang et al . , 2021 ) . AF dynamics is also involved in regulating the morphology of vacuoles in guard cells . AFs colocalize with tonoplasts and encircle small vacuoles ( Li et al . , 2013 ) . Both depolymerizing or stabilizing AFs by pharmacological agents inhibit the fusion of small vacuoles in guard cells during stomatal opening , as in other cell types ( Higaki et al . , 2006 ; Li et al . , 2013 ; Scheuring et al . , 2016 ) . SCAB1 is a plant - specific actin - binding protein that can bind , stabilize , and cross - link AFs through dimerization ( Zhao et al . , 2011 ; Zhang et al . , 2012b ; Wang et al . , 2015 ) . The mutation of SCAB1 affects the morphological remodeling of the vacuole , and an increased number of transvascular strands appear in the guard cells of scab1 mutants ( Yang et al . , 2021 ) . The ARP2 / 3 multi - subunit complex , containing two actin - related proteins ARP2 and ARP3 , and five other actin - related protein complex units ( ARPC1 - 5 ) , is an important nucleation - promoting and branching factor for AFs ( Deeks and Hussey , 2005 ; Yanagisawa et al . , 2013 ) . Vacuole fusion is impaired during stomatal opening in AF nucleator arp2 and arp3 mutants owing to abnormal reorganization of AFs ( Li et al . , 2013 ) . AFs are also involved in vesicle trafficking from Golgi and release to vacuole ( Kim et al . , 2005 ; Akkerman et al . , 2011 ) and the disassembly of AFs affects cargo trafficking from the Golgi complex to the vacuole ( Kim et al . , 2005 ) . AP3M , the medium subunit of the AP3 complex , serves as an AF - severing protein that participates AF reorganization and vacuole morphology . The mutation of AP3M alters AF status in guard cells and abolishes the transportation of Golgi cargoes , such as the sucrose exporter SUC4 , to the tonoplast , leading to defects in stomatal closure under drought stress ( Zheng et al . , 2019 ) . RESPONSE OF ACTIN - BINDING PROTEINS TO UPSTREAM SIGNALS IN GUARD CELLS Actin - binding proteins ( ABPs ) , which modulate AF nucleation , severing , bundling , polymerization , and depolymerization , alter AF dynamics to markedly respond to environmental changes ( Li et al . , 2015 ) . Recent studies have demonstrated that several ABPs are involved in the regulation of stomatal movement . Mutations in the ARP2 / 3 complex subunits arpc4 , arpc5 , arpc2 ( referred to as hsr3 ) , arp2 ( referred to as wrm ) , or arp3 ( referred to as dis1 ) cause a similar phenotype : reduced or abolished dark - , ABA - , and H 2 O 2 - induced stomatal closure and retarded light - induced stomatal opening ( Jiang et al . , 2012 ; Li et al . , 2013 , 2014 ; Isner et al . , 2017 ) . arpc4 and arpc5 mutants show sparser but thicker actin bundles in the guard cells of both opened and closed stomata , suggesting that AFs tend to form bundles in the mutants . AF reorganization is also hysteretic during stomatal closure in the mutants ( Li et al . , 2014 ) . The ABA - induced mesh - like network organization of AFs is suppressed and thus a more radial array of AFs is retained in the arpc2 mutant compared to the wild type ( Jiang et al . , 2012 ) . Cytochalasin D can restore the defect of stomatal closure in response to ABA in the hsr3 mutant , suggesting that ABA - induced AF disassembly is disrupted in hsr3 ( Jiang et al . , 2012 ) . The ARP2 / 3 complex is in an intrinsically inactive conformation , which could be converted to an active conformation by the WAVE / SCAR ( WASP family Verprolin homologous protein / Suppressor of cAMP Repressor ) complex ( Frank et al . , 2004 ; Deeks and Hussey , 2005 ; Yanagisawa et al . , 2013 ) . A mutation in the PIR1 gene encoding a subunit of the SCAR / WAVE complex results in reduced dark - induced stomatal closure , while a normal response to ABA or CaCl 2 is retained , and the dark - insensitive phenotype can be restored by latrunculin B or cytochalasin D treatment ( Isner et al . , 2017 ) . These results indicate that the ARP2 / 3 complex , along with its upstream regulator , the SCAR / WAVE complex , is required for stomatal movement through their roles in modulating AF disorganization and remodeling . However , it is still unclear how the ARP2 / 3 complex and the SCAR / WAVE complex contribute to AF disassembly or rearrangement in guard cells . Actin - Depolymerizing Factor ( ADF ) family is a conserved class of ABPs that are involved in plant development and stress responses . The Arabidopsis genome encodes 11 ADF genes categorized into four subclasses ( Inada , 2017 ; Nan et al . , 2017 ) , among which most members have conserved actin filament depolymerizing functions , while subclass III members have instead evolved filament bundling functions ( Nan et al . , 2017 ) . ADF4 , a member of subclass I , regulates stomatal closure in response to ABA . The adf4 mutant displays lower AF occupancy but thicker bundles in guard cells than the wild type ( Zhao et al . , 2016 ) . In contrast , the subclass III member ADF5 regulates drought - and ABA - induced stomatal closure via its AF - bundling activity . ABA and drought directly promote ADF5 expression mediated by ABF / AREB transcription factors in Arabidopsis and Populus ( Qian et al . , 2019 ; Yang et al . , 2020 ) . The guard cells of the adf5 mutant exhibit fewer and thinner bundles of actin filaments in open stomata and delayed actin filament reorganization during stomatal closure ( Qian et al . , 2019 ) . The activity of ADF proteins is governed by many factors , including pH , phosphorylation modifications , and phosphoinositide binding ( Inada , 2017 ) . The phosphorylation of the conserved sixth serine ( Ser - 6 ) of plant ADF1 and ADF4 inhibits their binding to AFs and therefore abolishes the AF - disassembling activity ( Porter et al . , 2012 ; Dong and Hong , 2013 ) . Recently , Shi et al . reported that ABA accumulates and inhibits PP2Cs activity through the ABA - PYLs - PP2Cs complex , resulting in the activation of CKL2 in guard cells ( Shi et al . , 2021 ) . The ABA - activated CKL2 ( Casein Kinase 1 - Like Protein 2 ) phosphorylates ADF4 at Ser - 6 , which contributes to AF reorganization in ABA - and drought - induced stomatal closure ( Zhao et al . , 2016 ) . More AF - severing events can be observed in the ckl2 mutant , and the severing activity of ADF4 is inhibited in the presence of CKL2 in vitro ( Zhao et al . , 2016 ) . Ser - 6 , Ser - 105 , and Ser - 106 of ADF4 can be phosphorylated by calcium - dependent protein kinase 3 ( CPK3 ) , which is required for the association with AFs , and stomatal immunity and Li et al . Cytoskeleton in Stomatal Movement Frontiers in Plant Science | www . frontiersin . org 4 February 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 849729 pattern - triggered immunity ( Lu et al . , 2020 ) . Moreover , the activity of ADFs is pH sensitive ( Zhang et al . , 2001 ; Nan et al . , 2017 ; Wioland et al . , 2019 ) . As stomatal movement is associated with changes in intracellular pH due to the influx or efflux of proton , it is plausible to speculate that pH changes may control stomatal movement at least partially by modulating the activity of ADFs . Villin belongs to a multifunctional villin / gelsolin / fragmin superfamily that exhibits multiple biochemical activities , including AF bundling , Ca 2 + - dependent AF severing , and barbed end capping ( Huang et al . , 2015 ) . A recent study detailed investigated the functions of Villin3 in stomatal immunity . Zou et al . reported that the vln3 mutant showed reduced AF turnover in guard cells treated with flg22 , resulting in failure to close stomata upon bacterial infection ( Zou et al . , 2021 ) . Flg22 - activated MPK3 / MPK6 phosphorylates Villin3 at Ser779 to specifically enhance its severing activity . Neither reduced AF bundling nor increased severing is observed in the guard cells of vln3 or mpk3 / 6 double mutant plants in the early stage of flg22 treatment compared to wild type . A phosphorylation mimic version of Villin3 can restore AF dynamics and stomatal movement in the vln3 and mpk3 / 6 mutants to the WT level , supporting the importance of VLN3 phosphorylation by MPK3 / 6 in modulating actin remodeling to activate stomatal defense in Arabidopsis ( Zou et al . , 2021 ) . Phosphoinositide exhibits an important function in stomatal movement and ABP activity regulation . The light - induced accumulation of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 triggers stomatal opening ( Lee et al . , 2007 ) . Phosphatidylinositol 4 - phosphate ( PI4P ) , a precursor of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 , and phosphatidylinositol 3 - phosphate ( PI3P ) are required for light - induced stomatal opening and ABA - induced stomatal closure and modulate actin dynamics in guard cells ( Jung et al . , 2002 ; Choi et al . , 2008 ) . The PI3P and PI4P synthesis inhibitors LY294002 and wortmannin inhibit the ABA - induced random orientation of AF arrays in the guard cells of dayflower ( Commelina communis ) ( Choi et al . , 2008 ) . Both overexpression and mutation of the AF cross - linking protein SCAB1 have similar effects , including a reduced rate of actin reorganization and a delay of stomatal closure induced by ABA . However , SCAB1 overexpression results in a higher frequency of bundled actin forms compared to the control , while the scab1 mutant shows similar actin filament reorganization to the wild type ( Zhao et al . , 2011 ) . Recent research has revealed that SCAB1 binds to PI3P through its RXLR - dEER PI3P - binding motifs . PI3P binding inhibits SCAB1 oligomerization , which further impairs AF destabilization and reorganization during ABA - induced stomatal closure ( Yang et al . , 2021 ) . Several members of other ABP families , such as Villins and ADFs , as well as the upstream regulator of ARP2 / 3 complex , the WAVE / SCAR complex ( Xiang et al . , 2007 ; Zhao et al . , 2010 ; Qin et al . , 2021 ) , bind to and are regulated by phospholipids . These interactions pose the possibility that phospholipids may regulate stomatal movement via multiple mechanism . MICROTUBULE ORGANIZATION CHANGES DURING STOMATAL MOVEMENT The function of MTs in stomatal movement has long been debated due to conflicting results from different experiments ( Assmann and Baskin , 1998 ; Fukuda et al . , 1998 ; Marcus et al . , 2001 ) . Assmann et al . reported that neither the microtubule - destabilizing drug colchicine nor the stabilization drug paclitaxel had any effect on stomatal opening or closing in epidermal peels of Vicia faba ( Assmann and Baskin , 1998 ) . Contrary results were observed by Fukuda et al . and Marcus et al . , where they showed that the microtubule - destabilizing drugs propyzamide , oryzalin , and trifluralin inhibited stomatal opening and that paclitaxel treatment suppressed stomatal closing in the same material ( Fukuda et al . , 1998 ; Marcus et al . , 2001 ) . It is still unclear why these experiments resulted in totally distinct conclusion . Nevertheless , accumulating evidences from recent decades favor the notion that the MT arrays participate in stomatal movement . During light - induced stomatal opening , oryzalin treatment blocks stomatal opening ( Eisinger et al . , 2012a ; Qu et al . , 2017 ) , while stabilization of microtubules by paclitaxel accelerates stomatal opening in a dose - dependent manner ( Qu et al . , 2017 ) . ABA - , darkness - , and NO - induced stomatal closure was markedly inhibited by cotreatment with paclitaxel , but no significant changes were observed when oryzalin was applied ( Zhang et al . , 2008 ; Eisinger et al . , 2012a ; Qu et al . , 2017 ; Biel et al . , 2020 ) . It has also been reported that treatment with oryzalin alone affects stomatal closure ( Khanna et al . , 2014 ) . Live - cell imaging revealed that the number and arrangement pattern of MTs in guard cells are correlated with the stomatal aperture . In open stomata , MTs radiate from the ventral side to the dorsal side in a more parallel , straighter and denser fashion relative to AF organization ( Eisinger et al . , 2012a ; Qu et al . , 2017 ; Biel et al . , 2020 ) . Following stomatal closing , MT structures decrease in number and become diffused . Some studies have shown that MTs completely depolymerized ( Qu et al . , 2017 ; Yu et al . , 2020 ) , while other studies have indicated that MTs are still present , but with reduced density , in closed stomata ( Khanna et al . , 2014 ; Biel et al . , 2020 ; Yu et al . , 2020 ; Dou et al . , 2021 ) . In the latter case , observable MTs tend to have a longitudinal arrangement and become crisscrossed or randomly patterned near the ventral side ( Fukuda et al . , 1998 ; Lahav et al . , 2004 ; Zhang et al . , 2008 ; Eisinger et al . , 2012a ; Biel et al . , 2020 ) . By using end - binding protein 1 ( EB1 ) to label the growing plus ends of microtubules , it was observed that there were no significant changes in the number of growing ends or the growth velocity rate of microtubules during stomatal closure . This observation suggested that the reduction of microtubule density during stomatal closure was most likely resulted from microtubule disassembly ( Eisinger et al . , 2012a , b ) . Recently , increasing observations indicate that cortical microtubules are sensitive to tensile stress ( Hamant et al . , 2008 , 2019 ; Gorelova et al . , 2021 ) . Based on the observations from atomic force microscopy and finite element method simulations , MT organization is found to be consistent with the tensile pattern of guard cell ( Sampathkumar et al . , 2014 ; Gorelova et al . , 2021 ) . Thus , changes in microtubule organization may be a consequence of stomatal movement . The functions of MTs in stomata movement are still poorly understood . MTs play essential roles in determining the arrangement of cellulose microfibrils and other non - cellulosic compounds in the cell walls , which provides mechanical properties for stomatal movement ( Oda , 2015 ; Rui and Anderson , 2016 ; Yi et al . , 2018 ) . MT guides the trajectories of the cellulose synthesis complexes Li et al . Cytoskeleton in Stomatal Movement Frontiers in Plant Science | www . frontiersin . org 5 February 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 849729 ( CSCs ) for cellulose synthesis at the cell surface ( Gutierrez et al . , 2009 ) . Colocalization between CSCs and MTs is reduced and CSC motility speed increase during dark - induced stomata closure ( Rui and Anderson , 2016 ) . During stomatal movement , cellulose in guard cell walls undergoes reorganization from a more diffuse distribution in opened stomata to extensive bundles in the closed state ( Rui and Anderson , 2016 ) . MTs also determine the alignment mode of callose deposition and disassembly of MTs by oryzalin disturbs the pattern of callose deposition in the guard cell ( Apostolakos et al . , 2009 ) . Thus , MT organization may impact on cell wall organization during stomatal movement and the detail mechanism deserves further investigation . MICROTUBULE - ASSOCIATED PROTEINS AND UPSTREAM SIGNALING IN REGULATING MICROTUBULE ORGANIZATION IN GUARD CELLS Several microtubule - associated proteins ( MAPs ) and their upstream regulators play vital roles in regulating MT organization and stomatal movement . WDL7 , a member of the WAVE - DAMPENED2 ( WVD2 ) / WVD2 - LIKE family , directly binds to and bundles MTs in vitro . WDL7 - overexpressing plants show delayed stomatal closure in response to ABA compared to WT plants . MTs are less sensitive to oryzalin - and ABA - induced MT disruption in WDL7 - overexpressing guard cells , indicating that WDL7 serves as a MT stabilizer . Consistently , the wdl7 mutant shows impairment of MT assembly and the stomatal opening response to light ( Dou et al . , 2021 ) . WDL7 protein stability is regulated by ubiquitination . MREL57 ( MICROTUBULE RELATED E3 LIGASE 57 ) directly targets and ubiquitinates WDL7 for degradation . mrel57 mutant exhibits ABA insensitivity of stomatal closure and microtubule disassembly in guard cells ( Dou et al . , 2021 ) . Several other ubiquitin E3 ligases , including JUL1 ( JAV1 - ASSOCIATED UBIQUITIN LIGASE1 ) and COP1 ( CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1 ) , also participate in MT remodeling during stomatal movement ( Khanna et al . , 2014 ) . JUL1 mediates ABA - induced microtubule disorganization and stomatal closure downstream of H 2 O 2 and calcium . JUL1 binds to polymerized microtubules but not tubulin heterodimers ( Yu et al . , 2020 ) . Darkness - and ABA - induced stomatal closure and MT disassembly are suppressed in the cop1 mutant , and oryzalin is able to reduce this effect , indicating that the function of COP1 is critical for MT destabilization upon darkness and ABA treatment in guard cells ( Mao et al . , 2005 ; Khanna et al . , 2014 ; Chen et al . , 2021 ) . It has been reported that COP1 directly ubiquitinates the MT stabilizer WDL3 in hypocotyl cells grown under darkness ( Lian et al . , 2017 ) . Whether an analogous mechanism exists in guard cells requires further evaluation . Phosphatidic acid ( PA ) has emerged as a vital signaling molecule involved in regulating cytoskeletal organization and dynamics under abiotic and biotic stresses , including the regulation of stomatal movement ( Pleskot et al . , 2013 ) . PA is produced through the hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine ( PC ) by phospholipase D ( PLD ) or the phosphorylation of diacylglycerol ( DAG ) by DAG kinase ( Testerink and Munnik , 2011 ; Pleskot et al . , 2013 ) . Heat shock triggers ROS production to stimulate the activity of plasma membrane - localized PLD δ , and PLD δ directly binds to and disassembles MTs and causes stomatal closure under heat stress ( Zhang et al . , 2017 ; Song et al . , 2020 ) . The mutation of PLD α 1 maintains stomatal opening and well - organized MTs in the presence of ABA . Exogenous application of PA but not PC , PE or PS promotes microtubule depolymerization in stomatal cells , suggesting that PA may regulate stomatal movement through its impact on MTs ( Jiang et al . , 2014 ) . However , the molecular mechanism underlying how PA induces MT depolymerization remains unclear . It has been reported that PA binds to MAP65 - 1 and promotes MT polymerization and bundling under salt stress ( Zhang et al . , 2012a ) . It still needs to be explored whether PA activates a MAP or a signaling pathway to disassemble MTs in guard cells . SINE1 and SINE2 ( SUN - INTERACTING NUCLEAR ENVELOPE PROTEIN 1 AND2 ) , which are two components of the plant LINC ( LINKER OF NUCLEOSKELETON AND CYTOSKELETON ) complex , are involved in regulating the reorganization of MTs in guard cells during stomatal movement . The loss of function of either SINE1 or SINE2 results in a disordered MT organization in open stomata ( Biel et al . , 2020 ) . There are fewer MT filaments or bundles in sine 1 or sine 2 mutants compared to the wild type during stomatal closure , leading to insensitivity to ABA - induced stomatal closure ( Biel et al . , 2020 ) . Translationally controlled tumor protein ( TCTP ) is a calcium - and tubulin - binding protein , and the binding of calcium facilitates TCTP binding to microtubules . The overexpression of TCTP increases ABA - and calcium - induced stomatal closure ratios to limit water evaporation by accelerating MT depolymerization ( Kim et al . , 2012 ) . The detailed characterization of the biochemical activities of SINE1 / 2 and TCTP toward MTs should be further defined . CONCLUSION AND PERSPECTIVE Based on the knowledge available , we propose a model of current progress about AF and MT dynamics that are regulated by different functional ABPs and MAPs during stomatal movement . In opened stomata , the ARP2 / 3 complex is activated by WAVE / SCAR complex and promotes AF nucleation and branching , contributing to AF network formation . In the transition stage of stomatal closure , AF - severing factors , such ADF4 and Villin3 , lead to AF depolymerization , and an increasing content of PI3P inhibits the cross - linking function of SCAB1 , promoting the disassembly of the AF network . Subsequently , the phosphorylation of ADF4 inhibits its severing activity , and the upregulation of ADF5 and SCAB1 dimer contributes to the formation of long AF bundles in closed stomata . WDL7 binds and stabiles MT in opened stomata . During ABA - induced stomatal closing , E3 ligase MREL57 ubiquitinates WDL7 for degradation ; ABA - triggered calcium influx activated TCTP to stimulate MT disassembly . PLD δ activated in an H 2 O 2 - and calcium - dependent manner and disassembles MTs upon heat stress ( Figure 1 ) . Li et al . Cytoskeleton in Stomatal Movement Frontiers in Plant Science | www . frontiersin . org 6 February 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 849729 FIGURE 1 | A schematic model of AF and MT remodeling accompanied by vacuole morphology during stomatal closure . The schematic model of stomata in the middle of the panel shows the distribution of AFs and MTs in guard cells with different stomatal apertures . The gray circular charts present the different morphology of vacuole during stomata movement . Several actin - binding proteins and microtubule - associated proteins are involved in regulating cytoskeletal rearrangement . ( 1 ) The Arp2 / 3 complex and the activator SCAR / WAVE complex are required for AF nucleation and branching , and darkness - induced stomata closure . ABA - triggered H 2 O 2 generation by RbohD / RbohF regulates AF dynamics through the Arp2 / 3 complex but does not regulate the SCAR / WAVE complex , and AF feedback regulates H 2 O 2 production . ( 2 ) ABA - triggered PI3P biosynthesis inhibits the oligomerization of SCAB1 . ( 3 ) A pathogen triggers MPK3 / MPK6 activation , and Villin3 is then phosphorylated to increase AF - severing activity . ( 4 ) AP3M of the AP3 complex severs AFs and regulates vesicles from Golgi carrying SUC4 fused to the tonoplast . ( 5 ) ADF4 binds to and severs AFs , and ABA - activated CKL2 and calcium - activated CPK32 induced by pathogens phosphorylate ADF4 to inhibit its activity and promote AF reorganization . ( 6 and 7 ) SCAB1 dimers and ADF5 monomers bundle and stabilize AFs and promote AF reassembly . ( 8 ) JUL1 and COP1 , two other E3 ubiquitin ligases , may control the degradation of unknown MT - stabilizing factors and promote MT disassembly . ( 9 ) WDL7 stabilizes MTs in open stomata . The E3 ubiquitin ligase MREL57 interacts with and ubiquitinates WDL7 for 26S proteasome degradation during ABA - induced stomatal closure . ( 10 ) ABA - triggered PA produced by PLD α induces MT depolymerization through an unknown mechanism . ( 11 ) An ABA - induced increase in cytosolic calcium increases TCTP binding to MTs and MT destabilization . ( 12 ) Heat shock stimulates H 2 O 2 production , and calcium influx activates PLD δ , which is required for MT depolymerization . Li et al . Cytoskeleton in Stomatal Movement Frontiers in Plant Science | www . frontiersin . org 7 February 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 849729 Although the dynamic distribution of AFs and MTs during stomatal movement has been reported , the underlying molecular mechanism is still not well understood . Additional ABPs , MAPs and upstream proteins involved in stomatal movement need to be detailed analyzed , which will facilitate to dissect the roles of cytoskeleton in transducing environmental signals to stomatal movement . The arrangement mode of AFs and MTs is somewhat similar in guard cells , posing the possibility that they may coordinate to control stomata movement . Some ABPs , such as formin proteins , have been reported to interact with both AFs and MTs ( Li et al . , 2010 ; Wang et al . , 2013 ; Sun et al . , 2017 ) . It is worthy to further investigate the interaction between AFs and MTs , as well as the underlying molecular mechanism in stomata . Although many evidences have demonstrated the potential for cytoskeleton in regulating the activity of ion channels , vesicles trafficking , and cell wall dynamics of guard cell , the detailed mechanisms need to be explored in further for advancing our understanding of the cytoskeleton function contributed to stomatal movement . Stomata are of great importance in the response and adaptation of plants to environmental changes . Previous research in this context has mainly focused on kidney - shaped guard cells in Arabidopsis , Vicia , and tobacco . The distribution of AFs and MTs in dumbbell - shaped guard cells in most crop plants is different from that in kidney - shaped guard cells ( Spiegelhalder and Raissig , 2021 ) . Advances in research on cytoskeletal dynamics in dumbbell - shaped guard cells remain relatively stagnant . Studies on the mechanisms of stomatal movement in crops will help to improve the efficiency of carbon assimilation and water use under the trend of global warming .
