Herein , we present a platform streamlining the production of hydrogel beads , detection of fluorescent signals , and post - analysis , using polyacrylamide ( PAA ) beads produced by droplet microfluidics as a model . A customized optical detection module is integrated with the data acquisition and analysis modules developed by LabVIEW and Python , respectively . The platform is evaluated by a series of characterizations . We expect to promote this platform for the quantitative assessment of biochemical reactions occurring in the PAA - based incubators . I . I NTRODUCTION Hydrogel beads are widely employed for biomedical applications including diagnostics [ 1 ] , drug delivery [ 2 ] and tissue engineering [ 3 ] , owing to the features of hydrophilicity , biocompatibility , and tailorable properties . Compared to their counterparts of solid and non - permeable particles , hydrogels are highly porous and permeable , providing an extended surface area for chemical functionalization for such as detection probes or targeting ligands required in biochemical reactions [ 4 ] . Moreover , the high liquid contents presented in hydrogels also provide the benefits of transparency and biocompatibility for the ease of optical detection [ 5 ] and aqueous - based biological reactions [ 6 , 7 ] . Recent developments on microfluidics [ 8 ] have enabled the production of hydrogel beads in a high - throughput ( > 1 , 000 drops per second ) and controllable ( uniform droplet size ) manner . Furthermore , the porosity of hydrogel network may also be regulated by the concentration of crosslinkers and polymerization catalysts , for an array of purposes including entrapment of cells or biomolecules [ 9 ] , DNA barcoding [ 6 ] , display of proteins [ 10 ] and as nanoreactors for enzymatic reactions [ 11 ] . While hydrogels have shown promise in many biological applications , an integrated and user - friendly platform is needed to further promote hydrogels for biosensing . Herein , we present a platform to streamline the production of functionalized hydrogel beads , optical detection and data analysis for the assessment of biochemical reactions confined in situ within the hydrogel beads . Polyacrylamide ( PAA ) , a widely employed hydrogel , was introduced in the droplet microfluidics for the production of PAA beads .

An Integrated Platform for the Assessment of Fluorescent Signals in Hydrogel Beads Produced by Droplet Microfluidics Kathrine Nygaard Borg , Guangyao Cheng , Ayush Shetty , Tianle Wang , Cinzia Tesauro , Birgitta Ruth Knudsen , and Yi - Ping Ho 2023 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Nanotechnology ( IEEE - NANO 2023 ) July 2 - 5 , 2023 Jeju , Korea 979 - 8 - 3503 - 3346 - 6 / 23 / $ 31 . 00 ©2023 IEEE 180 2023 I EEE 23 r d I n t e r n a t i o n a l C o n f e r e n c e o n N a n o t e c hn o l o g y ( N A N O ) | 979 - 8 - 3503 - 3346 - 6 / 23 / $ 31 . 00 © 2023 I EEE | D O I : 10 . 1109 / N A N O 58 4 06 . 2023 . 10231287 Authorized licensed use limited to the terms of the applicable license agreement with IEEE . Restrictions apply . Polydimethylsiloxane ( PDMS ) prepolymer was prepared in a 10 : 1 ratio ( base : curing agent , w / w ) ( Dow Corning ) , casted on the SU8 mold and cured at 55 ° C overnight . The crosslinked PDMS was peeled off and cut into slabs . Inlets and outlets were accessed using a hole - puncher of 1 . 0 mm in diameter ( Integra LifeSciences ) . Followed by a thorough cleaning with ethanol , the PDMS slabs were bonded onto a piece of cover glass with a layer of semi - cured PDMS ( base and curing agent at a weight ratio of 2 : 1 ) . The bonded assembly was incubated on a hotplate for 30 min at 95 ° C and subsequently baked overnight at 55 ° C to further strengthen the bonding . C . Production of Oligo Functionalized Polyacrylamide Beads PAA beads were prepared from an aqueous solution containing 1 ´ TBE buffer with 1 % ( w / v ) ammonium persulfate ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , 10 % acrylamide and bis - acrylamide solution ( 29 : 1 ) ( Bio - Rad ) and 15 µ M acrydite oligos . The oil solution consisted of 0 . 5 % Pico - Surf ( Sphere Fluidics ) and HFE - 7500 3M TM Novec TM ( Fluorochem ) supplemented with 0 . 5 % Tetramethylethylenediamine ( TEMED , Sigma Aldrich ) . Both solutions were loaded into 1 - mL syringes and connected to the two inlets of the droplet generator by 1 . 06 mm tubing ( Cole - Parmer ) . Controlled by two syringe pumps ( Harvard Apparatus ) , the volumetric flow rates of the aqueous ( Q A ) and the oil ( Q O ) solution were set at 2 µ L / min and 8 µ L / min , respectively . Generated droplets were collected from the outlet and transferred to a reaction tube and covered by a layer of mineral oil ( Sigma Aldrich ) to minimize evaporation . After polymerization overnight at 22 ° C , the PAA beads were released by adding a destabilizing surfactant , 1H , 1H , 2H , 2H - perfluoro - 1 - octanol ( final concentration 33 % v / v , Sigma - Aldrich ) to the emulsion phase . Followed by eight consecutive washes with 1 mL H 2 O , the retrieved acrydite oligo functionalized PAA beads were resuspended in H 2 O and stored at 4 ° C for the subsequent experiments . D . Characterization of Oligo Functionalization Acrydite oligo conjugation within the hydrogel network was confirmed by hybridization with the carboxyfluorescein ( FAM ) labelled complementary probes . The complementary probes were added to the beads in a molar ratio of 0 . 125 - 2 : 1 ( complementary probes : acrydite oligos ) . Followed by hybridization at 37 ° C for 1 hour , the beads were washed eight times by H 2 O before visualized by fluorescence microscopy . To estimate the number of acrydite oligos functionalized in each bead , a qPCR reaction was carried out in 1 ´ Phanta Max Buffer ( Vazyme ) supplemented with 0 . 2 mM dNTPs , 0 . 2 mM forward primer , 0 . 2 mM reverse primer , 0 . 02 U / µ L Phanta Max Super - Fidelity DNA polymerase ( Vazyme ) , 1 ´ EvaGreen ( Biotium ) and 3 % ( v / v ) acrydite oligo conjugated PAA beads or 10 % ( v / v ) DNA template . Samples containing 30 , 60 , 120 , 240 , 480 and 960 PAA beads were used . The DNA template in a range of 0 . 01 - 100 nM was used for the calibration . The thermocycling conditions were set as the following : initial denaturation at 95 ° C for 3 min followed by 25 amplification cycles , each comprising denaturation at 98 ° C for 15 sec , annealing at 62 ° C for 20 sec , and extension at 72 ° C for 20 sec . The number of acrydite oligos conjugated into each PAA bead was calculated using the following equation : Oligos per bead = ! ! " # ! $ × $ % & ’ ( ) * % & × % + % , & * - . , ( 1 ) Where x 1 and x 2 are the critical thresholds ( Ct values ) measured by qPCR obtained from the PAA beads and the calibration samples , respectively . n template denotes the number of moles of template used in the reaction , N A is Avogadro’s constant and N beads is the total number of beads . E . Optical Detection Module The detection channel was placed onto a fast XY scanning stage ( MLS203 - 1 , Thorlabs ) . Samples containing approximately 2 , 000 beads / µ L were loaded at a flowrate of 10 µ L / min . The optical detection module was customized as illustrated in Fig . 2 . Briefly , a blue diode laser emitting at 488 - nm ( MDL - III - 488L / 1 ~ 50mW , Changchun New Industries ) was used for the excitation , whereas the fluorescence emission was collected by a 20 ´ objective ( NA = 0 . 95 , Nikon ) and transmitted to a high - speed camera ( pco . dimax CS3 , PCO ) and a photomultiplier tube ( PMM02 - 1 , Thorlabs ) . A BNC adaptor ( BNC - 2110 , National Instruments ) was connected to a multifunction data acquisition ( DAQ ) device ( National Instruments ) for data logging . F . LabVIEW Programming and Post - Analysis The data acquisition and analysis were conducted by LabVIEW ( Version 18 . 0 . 1 , National Instruments ) and Python ( Version 3 . 10 . 9 ) , respectively , as shown in Fig . 3 . In the LabVIEW module , the 488 - nm laser was turned on and off to reduce unwanted excitation between different batches of data . A function of real - time modification of the PMT gain was designed to allow the user to set an appropriate gain based on the detected fluorescent intensities . The raw data were then recorded and multiplied by the PMT gain , defined as the calibrated values and stored together with the raw values in an array . A read , composing of an array of raw and calibrated values , was compressed and saved as a TDMS file at the user - given location after the recording was put to an end by the user . Figure 2 . Configuration of the optical detection module . 181 Authorized licensed use limited to the terms of the applicable license agreement with IEEE . Restrictions apply . Figure 3 . LabVIEW data acquisition module ( left panel ) and Python analysis module ( right panel ) . The Python program was used for post - analysis . Briefly , the TDMS file was read by the library of nptdms , followed by baseline calculation and signal analysis . The calibration column was extracted and saved as an array of floating points using the numpy library . The baseline was generated by taking the mean of the first 100 values . A threshold was set at the value equivalent to ( baseline + 10 ) . The scipy library then analyzed the signals beyond the threshold to identify the “peak” and the associated characteristics as shown in Fig . 4 . The highest value in each peak was defined as the peak height . The starting and end points of each peak were identified by comparing the values towards the left and right of a peak until approaching the baseline . The values were then registered , setting the threshold , for the determination of the peak width . Noted any peak with a width larger than 80 was filtered out and considered as noise or faulty reading . The area under a peak was then calculated using trapezoidal integration . These characteristics were then plotted in the form of histograms by the library matplot for visualization . Figure 4 . The definition of a “peak” and the associated characteristics . III . R ESULTS AND D ISCUSSION A . Production of Oligo Polyacrylamide Beads PAA beads were fabricated by a droplet generator as illustrated in Fig . 5a . The size of produced water - in - oil droplets was tunable by the volumetric flow rates of the dispersed ( Q A ) and the continuous ( Q O ) phase . At the flow ratio of 4 ( Q O / Q A ) ) the produced water - in - oil emulsions were measured 38 . 74 ± 1 . 64 µ m in diameter . After an overnight polymerization and removal of oil , the produced cross - linked and acrydite oligo functionalized PAA beads were observed swelled and measured 46 . 6 ± 1 . 98 µ m in diameter ( Fig . 5b ) , consistent with previous studies [ 14 ] . The porosity of PAA gels ( as illustrated in Fig . 5c ) , characterized by the concentration of total monomer and crosslinking monomer percentage [ 15 ] , was estimated to be approximately 14 nm based on the monomer concentration of 10 % [ 14 ] and considered as microporous , suitable for the molecular diffusion of solutes used in this study . B . Characterization of Oligo Functionalization The functionalization of acrydite oligos , as illustrated in Fig . 5c , was confirmed by fluorescent probes complementary to the acrydite oligos , as visualized by fluorescent microscopy ( Fig . 6a ) . Quantitative estimation of acrydite oligos per bead , calibrated by the Ct values obtained from qPCR curves ( Fig . 6b ) , showed that the higher initial concentrations yielded higher efficiency ( Fig . 6c ) . A plateau was observed at around 15 and 20 µ M initially added acrydite oligos with an approximate final concentration of 10 µ M of functionalized acrydite oligos per bead ( 1 . 15 ´ 10 8 oligos / bead , obtained in ( 1 ) with 20 fmol template and 120 N beads ) , i . e . ~ 50 - 60 % incorporation efficiency , consistent with previous studies [ 6 ] . 15 µ M of initial acrydite oligos was employed for the subsequent experiments .

Detection of Fluorescent Events and Post - Analysis Fig . 7 depicts the LabVIEW interface for real - time observation , showing a typical acquisition of fluorescent signals at a throughput of 352 Hz collected from ̴ 2 , 000 PAA beads / µ L flowing at 10 µ L / min in the detection channel . Beads of molar ratio 0 . 5 : 1 ( R = complementary probe : acrydite oligo ) was used for the initial analysis . The height , area and width of peaks were acquired by the developed program and shown in Fig . 8a - c , respectively . As observed in Fig . 8a and 8b , the distribution of peak height and peak area followed the normal distribution [ 16 ] . On the other hand , the peak width was observed rather uniform ( Fig . 8c ) , implying that the conjugation of complementary probes may be considered homogeneous . A calibration experiment was conducted by incubating an intended amount of acrydite oligo functionalized PAA beads with titrated amounts of complementary fluorescent probes , namely 2 ´ , 0 . 5 ´ and 0 . 125 ´ of the oligos functionalized into PAA beads , or R = 2 , 0 . 5 and 0 . 125 . As visualized in Fig . 8d , the fluorescent signals were observed stronger with higher concentration of complementary probes . Quantitative analysis was then conducted by the optical detection and analysis modules developed in this study . As shown in the distributions of peak heights from titrated samples ( Fig . 8e ) , elevated fluorescence was observed with increased complementary probes . Linear correlations were also observed between R and the maximum peak height , area under the peak , or the peak width with the R 2 of 0 . 98 , 0 . 9 , and 0 . 84 , respectively ( data not shown ) . Taken together , these measures may be subsequently used to assess the biochemical reactions in the PAA beads in a quantitative manner . IV . C ONCLUSION We have demonstrated a bead - based platform for the assessment of fluorescent signals with tailored optical detection and post - analysis modules . Decoding of fluorescent events in PAA beads was validated by a set of calibration samples containing fluorescent probes complementary to the oligos functionalized onto the beads . The proposed platform may be used for the analysis of biochemical reactions , such as enzymatic reactions , in a high - throughput and objective manner . Further , the platform may be integrated with a fluorescence - activated sorting module to extract the beads containing the intended products for subsequent analysis .
