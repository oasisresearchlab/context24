The post - acute phase of COVID - 19 refers to the persistent or new symptoms . This problem is becoming more relevant with the increasing number of patients who have contracted COVID - 19 and the emergence of new virus variants . In this case , preventive treatment with corticosteroids can be applied . However , not everyone beneﬁts from the treatment , moreover , it can have severe side eﬀects . Currently , no study would analyze who beneﬁts from the treatment . Methods : This work introduces a novel approach to the recommendation of Corticosteroid ( CS ) treatment for patients in the post - acute phase . We have used a novel combination of clinical data , including blood tests , spirometry , and X - ray images from 273 patients . These are very challenging to collect , especially from patients in the post - acute phase of COVID - 19 . To our knowledge , no similar dataset exists in the literature . Moreover , we have proposed a unique methodology that combines machine learning and deep learning models based on Vision Transformer ( ViT ) and InceptionNet , preprocessing techniques , and pretraining strategies to deal with the speciﬁc characteristics of our data . Results : The experiments have proved that combining clinical data with CXR images achieves 8 % higher accuracy than independent analysis of CXR images . The proposed method reached 80 . 0 % accuracy ( 78 . 7 % balanced accuracy ) and a ROC - AUC of 0 . 89 . Conclusions : The introduced system for CS treatment prediction using our neural network and learning algorithm is unique in this ﬁeld of research . Here , we have shown the eﬃciency of using mixed data and proved it on real - world data . The paper also introduces the factors that could be used to predict long - term complications . Additionally , this system was deployed to the hospital environment as a recommendation tool , which admits the clinical application of the proposed methodology . 1 . Introduction Since 2020 , the pandemic SARS - COV - 2 ( COVID - 19 ) aﬀected the lives of all people in the world . Although some cases have been re - ported as asymptomatic COVID - 19 infections [ 1 ] , almost 7 million cases ( November 2023 ) of COVID - 19 were fatal according to World Health Organization ( WHO ) statistics . Despite rapid and continuous improvements in prevention , diagnos - tics , and treatment , dealing with possible consequences and complica - tions in severe disease courses is still necessary . Those complications ( including thromboses , decompensation of comorbid diseases , and ﬁ - * Corresponding authors . E - mail addresses : anzhelika . mezina @ vut . cz ( A .

One of the common complications of severe COVID - 19 courses may be the subsequent development of PF [ 3 ] . Such compli - cations can be detected during the post - acute phase of COVID - 19 ( so - called long COVID ) . Preventive treatment with corticosteroids ( CS ) is one of the ways to decrease the risk . Nonetheless , not all patients beneﬁt from CS treatment , and , more - over , this medication is connected to numerous severe side eﬀects [ 4 – 7 ] . Some studies found that non - selected applications of CS treatment may be harmful [ 8 , 9 ] , and it is still unclear which patients may receive this therapy . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . csbj . 2023 . 11 . 057 Received 26 September 2023 ; Received in revised form 27 November 2023 ; Accepted 28 November 2023 Computational and Structural Biotechnology Journal 24 ( 2024 ) 53 – 65 54 A . Mezina , S . Genzor , R . Burget et al . Fig . 1 . The overall scheme of experiments for proposed recommendation system of CS treatment . Currently , there is still a lack of studies that would make per - sonalized recommendations on which patients will beneﬁt from the CS treatment and who will not . Additionally , not so many works use the combined clinical data for analysis because of the diﬃculty of collecting them . According to WHO statistics , there are 100 , 000 infec - tions on average a week ( at least in November 2023 ) , and there is a higher risk of development of PF after the severe acute phase of COVID - 19 [ 10 ] . The objective of this paper is to ﬁnd the relation between a pa - tient’s clinical condition in the post - acute phase of COVID - 19 at the beginning of treatment and the probability of beneﬁt from CS treatment using clinical information and chest X - ray image of the patient . Sometimes , patients may not be recommended to receive this medication and can avoid possible side eﬀects . To achieve this goal , we retrospectively analyzed the data from 273 patients showing the results of ( non - ) application of CS treatment and applied several techniques to preprocess this clinical data . We fur - ther proposed an ML - based and DL - based methodology that predicts whether the CS treatment is recommended or not based on the patient’s clinical data and the CXR . The application of artiﬁcial intelligence ( AI ) is an appropriate way because of its capability to process a large num - ber of parameters and to ﬁnd the relations in these data . The described experiment has two parts : 1 . CXR images have been used to predict whether the CS treatment is necessary . This part is performed using our novel deep learning ( DL ) architecture ; 2 . CXR images and data retrieved from spirometry , blood information , and anamnesis of the patient’s state of health were processed using our DL architecture and ML with a preprocessing of features . During these experiments , we show that such a combination of in - formation , such as clinical data and CXR images , provides about 8 % better accuracy than when it is used separately . The overall scheme of the experiment is depicted in Fig . 1 . The main contributions of this paper are : • Developed DL - based approach for treatment prediction for one of the most frequent long - term COVID - 19 complications . The method - ology is unique , and there is no comparable one published for this disease yet . • The proposed approach combines traditional machine learning methods for clinical data processing and our architecture of the neu - ral network , which consists of Vision Transformer and InceptionNet , for analysis of CXR images . • This study shows that combining clinical data and CXR images can give more accurate results than when used separately . • A wide range of parameters from patients’ anamnesis was analyzed , and the most statistically signiﬁcant parameters were identiﬁed . • The proposed framework was integrated into the internal hospital system as a part of the recommendation tool . • The dataset with clinical data and CXR from patients is introduced and available in [ 11 ] . The rest of the paper is structured as follows . Section 2 represents related work and describes relevant solutions based on utilizing mixed data and predicting treatment of other health problems . Next , Section 3 provides more details about the introduced methodology and neural network and the following prediction of CS necessity using clinical and CXR data . Further , Section 4 shows and discusses the experiment re - sults . The last Section 5 concludes the paper . 2 . Related work This Section represents the latest works and approaches that focus on applying AI in the related research ﬁelds to the stated problem . Firstly , the relevant DL methods for CXR processing are introduced . Sec - ondly , the overview of methods for processing mixed data is presented . Lastly , the application of ML for treatment prediction is provided . 2 . 1 . Chest X - ray image analysis CXR and Computed Tomography ( CT ) are mandatory and the most important diagnostic methods in pulmonology [ 12 ] . Since the amount of radiation received from a CXR is approximately 70 × lower than the Computational and Structural Biotechnology Journal 24 ( 2024 ) 53 – 65 55 A . Mezina , S . Genzor , R . Burget et al . radiation received from CT [ 13 ] , the CXR is still preferred for a general patient’s examination due to possible consequent risks . Therefore , the widespread task in the research ﬁeld is the analysis of CXR images , often performed using DL methods . These methods can be useful as an assistant tool for the radiologist [ 14 ] . One of the frequently used ways to construct the neural network for that is to use pre - trained models , such as ResNet [ 15 ] , DenseNet [ 16 ] , InceptionNet [ 17 ] , etc . , and to add some new blocks or modules , which help to adapt the model for a given problem . For example , the VGG16 with attention module distinguishes between COVID - 19 , viral , bacterial pneumonia , and normal [ 18 ] . Or , the same classes were detected us - ing EﬃcientNet - B5 with noisy student in [ 19 ] . Also , the approach [ 20 ] utilizes the pre - trained VGG16 model and several augmentation tech - niques ( conventional method , mixup , and Random Image Cropping and Patching ( RICAP ) ) to prevent the overﬁtting of the model . One of the ﬁrst approaches related to COVID - 19 detection is de - scribed in [ 21 ] . The authors proposed an ensemble deep learning model consisting of Densenet - 121 , Resnet - 50 , InceptionNet , Inception - Resnet , XCeption , and EﬃcientNet - B2 . As the input to the model , four images were generated : cropped and uncropped with sizes of 224 × 224 px and 331 × 331 px . The work results demonstrate that the achieved accuracy of 83 % is comparable with the consensus of experienced thoracic radi - ologists . The strategy of several branches is also applied in another work [ 22 ] . The authors used 20 individually trained deep neural networks to de - tect COVID - 19 and non - COVID - 19 pneumonia . This ensemble model achieved an AUC of 0 . 92 . The mentioned models can also be modi - ﬁed , as was done in [ 23 ] . The MobileNet network was adapted here for CXR image classiﬁcation to avoid the gradient vanishing problem and overﬁtting . Another work [ 24 ] performed experiments for COVID - 19 detection using pre - trained models EﬃcientNetB1 , NasNetMobile , and MobileNetV2 and achieved an accuracy of 96 % . EﬃcientNet was also applied for COVID - 19 detection in [ 25 ] . The proposed method has incorporated uncertainty into EﬃcientNetB3 . Some works describe the models , combining some pre - trained well - known models , as done in [ 26 ] . The authors proposed a model consist - ing of MobileNetV2 and VGG16 , and the ﬁnal classiﬁcation is performed with the concatenation of these two branches . The authors classiﬁed CXR images into COVID - 19 , Normal , Pneumonia Viral , and Pneumo - nia Bacterial . InceptionNetV3 can also be applied for this task [ 27 ] . Additionally to that , CycleGAN was used for data augmentation . Also , a possible way is to use the convolutional network , which consists of convolutional and max pooling layers . According to the authors of work [ 28 ] , it is possible to achieve an accuracy of 99 % for COVID - 19 detection . According to the studied literature , many approaches focus on pro - cessing CXR obtained from the acute phase of COVID - 19 and detecting viral and bacterial pneumonia and COVID - 19 . However , there is no at - tention to the post - acute phase of this disease . 2 . 2 . Analysis of mixed medical data In medical research , data analysis can be done over images , clini - cal data , or a combination of both . Such a combination of data can give much more information , and consequently , it can increase the accu - racy of AI methods [ 29 ] . Such application is also actual in a pandemic , where predicting the possible complications is necessary . It can assist in prescribing treatment or clinical outcomes and help organize hospi - tal resources . With this motivation , the authors of work [ 30 ] proposed a method - ology that uses mixed data to identify patients at risk of severe conse - quences , which can lead to intensive care or death . The article described three data - processing approaches : handcrafted , hybrid , and end - to - end learning . The best - achieved accuracy is 76 . 9 % , which is produced by a hybrid method . Another work [ 31 ] uses mixed data in an end - to - end manner . The proposed neural network consists of two branches : CNN , which pro - cesses CXR images , and MLP , which consists of two dense layers for numerical data processing . The goal is to diﬀerentiate between COVID - 19 and non - COVID - 19 patients . According to the results , the model has achieved 95 . 4 % accuracy . The comparison of three diﬀerent scenarios , diagnosis of COVID - 19 using clinical data with a fully connected neural network , CXR images with EﬃcientNetB7 , and a combination of both , is introduced in [ 32 ] . The authors used data from 270 patients . The most accurate case is the combination of clinical data and CXR images , which achieved an accuracy of 97 % . The disease severity and progression are also described in [ 33 ] . For the experiment , the EﬃcientNet for image - based severity prediction and a neural network with some dense layers for clinical - data - based severity prediction are used to perform the ﬁnal severity prediction . Combined progression prediction is performed using a so - called survival forest for output of the dense layer with 256 neurons from the previously men - tioned models for images , clinical parameters , and chest CXR severity scores . The results show that the image and clinical data combination performs better for severity prediction ( ROC - AUC 0 . 792 ) and progres - sion prediction ( C - index 0 . 752 ) on the external test set . Another application of DL to mixed data is represented in [ 34 ] . The methodology consists of the following steps : 1 ) the 3D CNN ex - tracts the features from CT images , the clinical data are concatenated , 2 ) dimensionality reduction is performed with the Principal Compo - nent Analysis ( PCA ) method , 3 ) ﬁnal classiﬁcation is performed using CatBoost . The algorithm is aimed to predict categories of patients : who needed intensive care unit admission or were dead and who were healed and moved to non - COVID wards for further care . The achieved results are promising : AUC of 0 . 949 . Currently , most studies using mixed data focus exclusively on the acute phase of COVID - 19 treatment . However , no approach analyzes data from the post - acute phase of COVID - 19 . In this way , our work ﬁlls the gap in research by providing analysis using AI of patients’ CXR and clinical data from the post - acute phase . 2 . 3 . Treatment recommendation Another research question is whether it is possible to predict the response to some treatment or an optimal dose of medication using AI . One of our latest research works [ 35 ] is primarily focused on CS treatment prediction , but it is based only on clinical data of patients . This approach compared several ML algorithms , such as Logistic Re - gression , k - NN , Decision Tree , XGBoost , Random Forest , SVM , MLP , AdaBoost , and LGBM , for the mentioned problem . The best - achieved results belong to the decision tree with a balanced accuracy of 73 . 52 % . Some works have already been focused on this task , but for other ﬁelds of medicine . One of the popular ﬁelds of research is related to cancer . For example , the work [ 36 ] proposes the two - staged DL frame - work , which consists of tumor segmentation and response prediction . The results show that the segmentation component is essential to re - sponse prediction . Another approach combines the information from the CT image and clinical data [ 37 ] . The article retrospectively analyzes the outcome predictions for individualized radiotherapy doses . The proposed model predicts treatment failures with a C - index of 0 . 72 . Also , ML was applied to predict insuﬃcient response to methotrex - ate in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis [ 38 ] . The results show logistic regression is the most successful in this task , and achieved an AUC of 0 . 77 . On the other hand , some works focused on predicting the outcome of treatment for COVID - 19 [ 39 ] . For example , work [ 40 ] proposes a DL framework with Whale Optimization Algorithm ( WOA ) , which uti - lizes CT images and some additional information about patients ( age , infection stage , etc . ) and is aimed to predict the patient’s response to treatment during the acute phase .

Related work summary All approaches mentioned in this section are summed up in Table 1 . Considering the studied literature and the current state of technolo - gies , it can be concluded that there is no work focusing on retrospective analysis based on clinical data and CXR images of patients’ COVID - 19 post - acute phase . Additionally , no ML / DL approach would recommend treatment for one of the most severe long - term post - COVID complica - tions , except our work . This way , we aim to ﬁll the gap in the research ﬁeld because our work represents the analysis of such data and provides a unique dataset with a combination of the clinical data and CXR im - ages and a detailed statistical evaluation of the proposed methodology . 3 . Methodology This section introduces a DL - based approach to recommend preven - tive CS treatment for one of the most severe long - term post - COVID - 19 complications – PF . First , data are preprocessed , including image processing and selec - tion from the clinical data . Then , the recently proposed our neural network and the following comparison with other architectures are de - scribed . Finally the two scenarios of experiments : 1 ) with only CXR images , and 2 ) a combination of CXR and clinical data , are introduced . Generally , the experiment consists of the following steps ( see Fig . 1 ) : 1 . Training our neural network on open large dataset ChestX - ray14 [ 41 ] and comparing it with other well - known architectures to select the most successful architecture for further use ; 2 . Testing trained model selected from the previous step on given CXR images to determine the necessity of CS ( experiment 1 ) ; 3 . Statistical evaluation and selection of most signiﬁcant parameters from clinical data ; 4 . Application of DL and ML to combined data : CXR image and se - lected parameters from clinical data ( experiment 2 ) . The dataset [ 11 ] and source code [ 42 ] are available online . 3 . 1 . Data preparation One of the main parts of ML methods is data preparation . Generally , this phase consists of CXR image preprocessing , parameter selection , and labeling . 3 . 1 . 1 . Custom dataset In this work , the new dataset with CXR images and clinical data of patients from post - acute COVID - 19 is introduced and provided by Uni - versity Hospital Olomouc , Czech Republic . Patients’ data were collected during the initial check - up , which is 4 – 12 weeks after the acute onset of COVID - 19 . All of the examinations , including blood tests , CXR , and pulmonary function tests , were performed at the same time . The dataset has a total of 273 patients , where the information about the necessity of CS is given : 141 patients will not beneﬁt from CS treat - ment , and 132 will beneﬁt from it . It is essential to note that all of the patients requiring CS treatment had pneumonia during the acute phase of COVID - 19 . In addition , all of those patients had persisting pulmonary involvement . However , in a signiﬁcant proportion of the patients , there was spontaneous regression of the lung damage . The model aimed to identify those with proﬁt from CS therapy . This dataset includes more than 100 parameters , including blood test values , pulmonary function test ( spirometry ) , the patient’s anamnesis , clinical condition , and X - ray images as summarized in Table 2 . Notably , several patients had negative or N / A results for COVID - 19 testing – anti - SARS - CoV - 2 IgG . COVID - 19 was diagnosed with very suspicious clinical symptoms , radiology images , and the presence of anti - SARS - CoV - 2 IgM antibodies ( only in non - vaccinated individuals at the beginning of the epidemic ) . 3 . 1 . 2 . Parameters selection The parameter selection from the clinical data represented with quantitative and categorical numbers is essential for avoiding over - ﬁtting . The clinical data consist of information taken at the time of initiation of post - COVID treatment . In this step , the parameters are pre - Computational and Structural Biotechnology Journal 24 ( 2024 ) 53 – 65 57 A . Mezina , S . Genzor , R . Burget et al .

The feature selection is depicted in Fig . 3 . The ﬁrst one is SHapley Additive exPlanations ( SHAP ) [ 43 ] , which explains the feature importance for a given ML method , i . e . , the Deci - sion Tree in our case . The output is depicted in Fig . 2 . As can be seen , the amount of CS received during the treatment ( i . e . , dose × period ) ( CS _ amount ) and Immunoglobulin M antibodies ( IgM ) ( SARS - CoV - 2 IgM ( quant . ) ) values from blood tests signiﬁcantly impact CS treatment . IgM indicates an early immune response after infection in the body . Another statistical method used was 𝑘 - highest scores based on 𝑝 - values [ 44 ] . The common parameters of both methods are the amount of used CS ( CS _ amount ) , peripheral blood monocytes % ( KO _ Mo % ) , and Expiratory Reserve Volume ( ERV ) ( ERV ( abs ) ) values . From the 𝑘 - best method following features were selected : CS use ( CS ) , olfactory loss ( olfactory _ loss ) , post - COVID disability ( postcovid _ disability ) , level of speciﬁc anti - SARS - CoV - 2 immunoglobulin M antibodies ( SARS - CoV - 2 IgM ( quant . ) ) , the dose of CS ( CS _ amount ) , duration of CS ( CS _ dura - tion _ weeks ) , red cell distribution width ( RDW ) ( KO _ RDW ) , vital capac - ity ( VC ) ( absolute ) ( VC ( abs ) ) , forced expiratory volume in 1 second FEV1 ( absolute ) ( FEV1 ( abs ) ) , and peak expiratory ﬂow ( PEF ) ( % of pre - dicted ) ( PEF ( % pred ) ) . Fig . 2 . Feature importance analysis based on SHAP method using the decision tree . Additionally , some other parameters were pre - selected manually af - ter series of trials to achieve the best eﬀect of CS prediction . These parameters correlate with the severity of the pneumonia and impact the persisting pulmonary damage , leading to an indication of CS treat - ment . A brief description of selected ones is introduced below : • Pneumonia – patients with this variable have had COVID - 19 pneu - monia ; • CS another problems – patients received CS treatment due to other indications ; • SARS - CoV - 2 IgG ( qualit . ) – presence of IgG antibodies against COVID - 19 ; • FVC ( % pred ) – forced vital capacity ( % of predicted values ) ; • DLCOcSB ( abs . ) – lung diﬀusing capacity for carbon monoxide ( ab - solute values ) , which is a transfer factor ( i . e . correlate of alveolar volume ) ; • KCOcSB ( abs . ) – lung diﬀusing capacity for carbon monoxide ( abso - lute values ) , which is a transfer coeﬃcient ( i . e . correlate of alveolar diﬀusion ) ; • Persistent cough – presence of long - lasting cough after COVID - 19 ( for more than 4 weeks ) ; • Persistent dyspnea – presence of long - lasting dyspnea after COVID - 19 ( for more than 4 weeks ) ; • MEF25 ( abs . ) – maximal expiratory ﬂow at 25 % of vital capacity . The ﬁnal set of features contains the following : Presence of pneu - monia at the acute COVID - 19 phase , comorbidity , CS use , olfactory loss during the acute COVID - 19 phase , post - COVID - 19 disability , SARS - CoV - 2 IgG ( qualit . ) , SARS - CoV - 2 IgM ( quant . ) , amount of used CS , total used CS , duration of CS use in weeks , RDW , VC ( abs ) , FVC ( % pred ) , FEV1 ( abs ) , Mo % , PEF ( % pred ) , DLCOc ( abs ) , KCOc ( abs ) , persistent cough , persistent dyspnea and MEF25 ( abs ) .

Data labeling The clinical data also contains information about the objective radi - ological score , which reﬂects the lung damage regression in the range of 0 ( immutable state ) to 10 ( complete regression ) . This parameter gives information on whether the patient’s health has improved . Patients with scores between 0 and 6 are not considered to have signiﬁcantly im - proved their health status . For the values 7 - 10 , it is considered that their status improved . Considering this information , it was possible to determine the necessity of CS , i . e . , whether the patient will beneﬁt from the CS treatment . The dataset was split into training and testing subsets . The training set has 218 patients ( 111 – not recommended , 107 – rec - ommended ) . The testing set has 55 patients ( 30 – not recommended , 25 – recommended ) . 3 . 1 . 4 . Chest X - ray image preparation The CXR images were cropped to the area of interest for all experi - ments . This step uses a pre - trained U - Net [ 45 ] model for lung segmen - tation , used in [ 21 ] . This step helps the neural network to focus on the lungs instead of considering the surrounding area . Another important step is data augmentation to reduce the model’s possible overﬁtting . For this purpose , transformations ( e . g . , translation , rotation , and zoom ) were applied to extend the dataset during the train - ing . This work uses two datasets with CXR images : the ChestX - ray14 dataset [ 41 ] for pre - training and our custom dataset for CS prediction . ChestX - ray14 has a total of 112 , 120 images with 14 pulmonary diseases : Atelectasis , Cardiomegaly , Consolidation , Edema , Eﬀusion , Emphysema , Fibrosis , Hernia , Inﬁltration , Mass , Nodule , Pleural thick - ening , Pneumonia , and Pneumothorax . Among the mentioned diseases , some images do not have any disease . It is one of the most frequently used datasets in this ﬁeld of research . However , the images with at least one pulmonary disease were selected for this experiment . The dataset was divided into training ( 36 , 024 images ) and testing ( 15 , 735 images ) parts according to the oﬃcial dataset split . Also , the validation set is 20 % of the training set . 3 . 2 . Neural network for feature extraction from X - ray images A neural network is selected for image processing in this part of the experiment . First , the description of our architecture of the neural network [ 46 ] is presented . Then , a comparison with other well - known architectures is performed . Fig . 4 . Scheme of the inception module . 3 . 2 . 1 . Architecture The recently proposed neural network is aimed to perform the clas - siﬁcation task over CXR images . The ﬁrst step is to classify images from the ChestX - ray14 dataset , which is prepared for multilabel classiﬁca - tion . That is why the following description will be focused on multilabel classiﬁcation . The overall scheme is introduced in Fig . 5 . This architecture applies the strategy of two branches to capture global and local features . This concept has been widely used in litera - ture [ 26 , 47 , 48 ] . On the one hand , using only one branch is not so eﬀec - tive , according to the results presented in the following sections . On the other hand , applying more branches increases the model’s complexity , making it more computationally demanding . That is why the optimal solution in this case is using two branches . The ﬁrst branch aims to ex - tract the global features and is represented with InceptionNetV3 [ 17 ] . After InceptionNetV3 , GlobalMaxPooling , Dense , and Dropout layers are used for the ﬁnal classiﬁcation . The second branch consists of four parts . First , feature extraction is performed with three inception mod - ules . Fig . 4 shows the architecture of the inception module . After the inception modules , the Vision Transformer ( ViT ) [ 49 ] was utilized for the following processing . Fig . 6 shows the architecture of ViT in more detail . The concatenation of two branches consists of three dense layers with 64 , 32 , and 14 units to provide the ﬁnal results .

Scheme of the transformer network used in the proposed architecture . has a sigmoid activation function since it is necessary to perform the multilabel classiﬁcation . Considering that the dataset is slightly imbalanced , the Asymmet - ric Loss ( ASL ) function was used [ 50 ] . Additionally , it was modiﬁed : instead of binary cross - entropy , the focal loss function was applied . Mathematically , it has a uniﬁed formula ( more details can be found in the original paper ) [ 50 ] : 𝐴𝑆𝐿 = { 𝐿 + = ( 1 − 𝑝 ) 𝛾 + log ( 𝑝 ) , 𝐿 − = ( 𝑝 𝑚 ) 𝛾 − log ( 1 − 𝑝 𝑚 ) , ( 1 ) where 𝐿 + and 𝐿 − are the positive and negative loss parts , 𝑝 is the output probability from the network , 𝑝 𝑚 is the shifted probability , 𝛾 is the focusing parameter . The set up parameters are 𝛾 − is 5 , 𝛾 + is 1 , clip is 0 . 001 . The focal loss function is described in [ 51 ] : 𝐹𝐿 ( 𝑝 𝑡 ) = − 𝛼 𝑡 ( 1 − 𝑝 𝑡 ) 𝛽 log ( 𝑝 𝑡 ) , ( 2 ) where 𝑝 𝑡 is the model’s estimated probability for the class with label 𝑦 = 1 , 𝛼 𝑡 is the balancing factor , and 𝛽 is the modulating factor . 3 . 2 . 2 . Comparison with traditional methods To compare the proposed model with other methods , some well - known architectures for image classiﬁcation were selected : DenseNet121 [ 16 ] , EﬃcientNetB4 [ 52 ] , InceptionNetV3 [ 17 ] , ResNet101 [ 15 ] and VGG16 [ 53 ] . These models were also trained on the ChestX - ray14 dataset to detect diseases in CXR . The following values were used for hyper - parameter tuning for all the mentioned architectures , including our architecture : batch size – 8 , number of steps per epoch – 1000 , num - Computational and Structural Biotechnology Journal 24 ( 2024 ) 53 – 65 60 A .

All mentioned methods used as a baseline apply the binary cross - entropy as a loss function . Tables 3 and 4 represent the results of trained models . The perfect and maximum value for each metric is 1 . Based on the results , it can be concluded that the proposed model achieves better accuracy than other neural network architectures with AUC – 0 . 7952 , speciﬁcity – 0 . 7326 , accuracy – 0 . 7334 , precision – 0 . 2541 , and F1 score – 0 . 3478 . The EﬃcientNetB4 model has worse results than the proposed model but has achieved better results among other methods from the baseline . It has an AUC of 0 . 7772 , sensitivity of 0 . 7079 , speciﬁcity of 0 . 7221 , accuracy of 0 . 7223 , precision of 0 . 2419 , and F1 score of 0 . 3324 . On the other hand , the worst results were achieved by ResNet101 for such metrics as accuracy ( 0 . 7520 ) and sensitivity ( 0 . 7011 ) . Tables 3 and 4 also show the results for InceptionNetV3 , used in the proposed model . It performed with an AUC of 0 . 7522 , sensitivity of 0 . 7073 , speciﬁcity of 0 . 6869 , accuracy of 0 . 6864 , precision of 0 . 2314 , and F1 score of 0 . 3171 . As can be seen , the application of InceptionNetV3 independently has worse results for all metrics than the proposed model . From this fact , it can be concluded that the application of ViT and asymmetric loss function is eﬀective for this ﬁeld of research . Considering the above - mentioned results , our model is the most suit - able for the following experiments . 3 . 3 . Experiments with custom dataset This section describes the experiments on our custom dataset con - taining CXR images and clinical data . As mentioned in previous sec - tions , the experiment’s goal is to determine whether treating the patient with CS is recommended . This experiment is divided into two parts . The ﬁrst one is aimed at experimenting only on CXR images . The second part is designed to apply CXR images and clinical data . The pre - trained model from section 3 . 2 is used for both parts . 3 . 3 . 1 . Classiﬁcation of chest X - ray images This part of the experiment is supposed to determine whether the CS treatment is needed , taking into consideration only a CXR image of the patient . The feature extractor is the main part , which is a pre - trained neural network from the previous step ( see subsection 3 . 2 . 1 ) . Instead of adding new layers to a pre - trained network , which would perform the binary classiﬁcation , we applied traditional ML methods to the latent space of the three last layers of the neural network . The combination of NN and traditional ML has been successfully applied in some other works , for example , in [ 54 , 34 , 55 ] . This method was selected because ﬁne - tuning pre - trained NN and adding several new layers to perform the classiﬁcation can be ineﬀective since the dataset is relatively small . The traditional ML algorithms in our experiment were independently applied to the last three layers . Consequently , three diﬀerent results were achieved . The scheme of the experiment is depicted in Fig . 7 . For the experiment , the following traditional ML algorithms [ 56 ] were evaluated : Random Forest ( RF ) , Multilayer Perceptron ( MLP ) , Lo - gistic Regression ( LR ) , Decision Tree ( DT ) , 𝑘 - Nearest Neighbors ( kNN ) , Support Vector Machine ( SVM ) , and AdaBoost . An optimization technique , random search with cross - validation with ﬁve folds , is used to ﬁnd the best hyper - parameter combination . The found optimal hyper - parameters for diﬀerent ML methods and dif - ferent outputs from the last layers are shown in Table 5 . 3 . 3 . 2 . Classiﬁcation with mixed data The second part of the experiment aims to determine the necessity of CS , considering the combination of CXR images and clinical data . The experiment scheme is depicted in Fig . 8 . As can be seen , the CXR image is fed into our neural network , which is pre - trained on general pulmonary diseases , where the features are extracted . The outputs from the last layers are concatenated with the preselected clinical features ( see section 3 . 1 . 2 ) . Here , it is considered that additional information can improve the prediction accuracy of the necessity of CS treatment . And , as was described in the previous part , the traditional ML methods are applied independently to each pair layer output + clinical data . There were three experiments because the three last layers were used for the experiment . As was presented in the previous part , the set of ML methods is used the same . Here also the optimization technique , such as random search with cross - validation ( 𝑛 = 5 ) . The optimal hyper - parameters are found and introduced in Table 6 . 4 .

Metrics The metrics used are accuracy , precision , recall , balanced accuracy , and F1 - score , which are usually used in evaluating classiﬁcation tasks . The deﬁnitions of the mentioned metrics are shown below [ 35 ] : 𝐴𝑐𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑦 = 𝑇𝑁 + 𝑇𝑃 𝑇𝑃 + 𝑇𝑁 + 𝐹𝑃 + 𝐹𝑁 , ( 3 ) 𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 = 𝑇𝑃 𝑇𝑃 + 𝐹𝑃 , ( 4 ) 𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙 = 𝑆𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑖𝑡𝑦 = 𝑇𝑃 𝑇𝑃 + 𝐹𝑁 , ( 5 ) 𝑆𝑝𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑓𝑖𝑐𝑖𝑡𝑦 = 𝑇𝑁 𝑇𝑁 + 𝐹𝑃 , ( 6 ) 𝐹 1 = 2 ⋅ 𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 ⋅ 𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙 𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 + 𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙 , ( 7 ) 𝐴𝑐𝑐 BAL = 𝑆𝑝𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑓𝑖𝑐𝑖𝑡𝑦 + 𝑆𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑖𝑡𝑦 2 , ( 8 ) where 𝑇𝑁 – number of True Negative cases , 𝑇𝑃 – True Positives , 𝐹𝑃 – False Positives , 𝐹𝑁 – False Negatives . 4 . 2 . Classiﬁcation of chest X - ray data This section introduces the results for predicting CS treatment ne - cessity based on CXR images . Table 7 shows the results for diﬀerent last layers output processed with some traditional ML methods . The best po - tential result for all metrics is 1 , and the worst is 0 . As can be seen , the most successful method is the RF , which was applied for the last layer ( - 3 ) . The results are : accuracy is 0 . 7273 , F1 is 0 . 7059 , balanced accu - racy is 0 . 7267 , and ROC - AUC is 0 . 7247 . However , MLP has the best result for recall 0 . 76 . The kNN method from the last layer ( - 1 ) has the best precision result 0 . 73 . For the other layers , the results are close to the ones mentioned above . For the last layer ( - 1 ) , RF has the best results for accu - racy ( 0 . 7091 ) , F1 ( 0 . 6923 ) , recall ( 0 . 72 ) , balanced accuracy ( 0 . 71 ) , and ROC - AUC ( 0 . 71 ) . The RF performs better than other methods for the last layer ( - 2 ) . It succeeded with an accuracy of 0 . 7091 , F1 of 0 . 6522 , pre - cision of 0 . 7143 , balanced accuracy of 0 . 70 , and a ROC - AUC of 0 . 6933 . DT method is the best for recall ( 0 . 64 ) . Another interesting direction for investigation is the identiﬁcation of the disease that has the most signiﬁcant impact on the decision for CS treatment . As mentioned above , for this experiment , the used neural network was pre - trained on the large dataset ChestX - ray14 , which is la - beled for 14 diﬀerent pulmonary diseases . The last layer output of this Fig . 9 . SHAP evaluation for the outputs of last layer ( - 1 ) of NN in experiments with only CXR . model is a vector of probabilities of various illnesses . This output is fed into selected traditional ML algorithms , and the decision on CS treat - ment is performed . To investigate , which values of NN output are the most signiﬁcant for decision - making , the SHAP analysis was applied to explain the model . Fig . 9 shows the feature importance for the selected algorithm , in this case , for RF ( accuracy is 0 . 7091 ) . As can be seen , the highest values have the following diseases : Eﬀusion , Fibrosis , and Edema . The other ones have less impact on output , but it is still high . 4 . 3 . Classiﬁcation of mixed data Another conducted experiment has not only CXR image data but also additional clinical information about every patient ( blood test , spirom - etry , and anamnesis ) . The results are shown in Table 8 . Here , it is more diﬃcult to determine the absolutely successful combination of one of the last layers and the ML method . However , the MLP for the last layer ( - 2 ) has the best results for accuracy ( 0 . 80 ) , balanced accuracy ( 0 . 7867 ) and ROC - AUC ( 0 . 8933 ) . On the other hand , DT for the last layer ( - 1 ) has achieved the best value Computational and Structural Biotechnology Journal 24 ( 2024 ) 53 – 65 63 A . Mezina , S . Genzor , R . Burget et al .

Finally , MLP for the last layer ( - 3 ) has the absolute result for precision ( 1 . 0 ) . Despite such diﬀerent results , comparing Tables 7 and 8 , it can be concluded that the combination of CXR and clinical data gives more accurate results than those performed only for CXR images . Here , it can also be noticed that using outputs from the last layer can beneﬁt the practical side . As less abstraction is used for decisions , it is easier to interpret the results . As mentioned in the previous section , the last layer of NN indicates the probability of a pulmonary disease . Another point that would be considered is the importance of met - rics . In some cases , paying attention to the rate of false negatives would be more essential since the missed therapy can be crucial for a patient . On the other side , considering several metrics can be more informative since they can give complete information regarding tested methods . Consequently , some weak sides can be identiﬁed . However , all these points should be consulted with experts ( doctors ) who will use the methodology . Compared to our previous work [ 35 ] , this approach has improved the capability of CS treatment prediction for more than 6 % accuracy . Here , it can be concluded that additional information , such as CXR is useful in CS treatment prediction . Notably , the proposed methodology is more complex than the previous one , which indicates that this research ﬁeld requires advanced processing methods . On the other hand , the problem of interpretation is arising . In previous work , the decision tree can be quickly drawn and the doctors can evaluate the correctness of the algorithm . However , in case of neural networks , it is getting more complicated , and several additional techniques are required to reveal the reasons for algorithm decisions . 4 . 4 . Summary and future work According to relatively good results , it can be concluded that the ap - plication of AI for preventive CS treatment can accurately recommend CS treatment to patients who can potentially beneﬁt from the treat - Computational and Structural Biotechnology Journal 24 ( 2024 ) 53 – 65 64 A .

We also conclude that combining the raw CXR image data with clinical data is signiﬁcantly more accurate than just CXR images . Despite the application of relatively computation - demanding architectures , such as InceptionNet and Vision Transformer , the proposed architecture can be applied to real - world environments . This is proved by deploying the methodology into the internal hospital system . This work attempted to use the optimal input image size so that the details would be preserved , and it is not computationally demanding . On the other hand , if this methodology is applied in another hospital environment , it is necessary to consider the allowed latency , processing time , and frequency of us - age . Depending on these points , the hardware should be chosen wisely . However , this work has some issues and requires some improvements . Firstly , the relatively small custom dataset is used , which is why the overﬁtting problem can appear . As future work , this dataset is sup - posed to be extended , especially with the appearance of new mutations . Here it is also worth mentioning , that some patients were diagnosed with other methods , than anti - SARS - CoV - 2 IgG testing , but with clini - cal symptoms , radiology image , and presence of anti - SARS - CoV - 2 IgM antibodies . It indicates , that other clinical information should also be considered during patient examination and treatment prescription . Secondly , in this work , the model was pre - trained on general pul - monary diseases . However , in future work , the model should be pre - trained also on COVID - 19 datasets . It would make the NN more adapted to the problems related to COVID - 19 . Thirdly , this paper utilizes the two methods of feature selection . However , the following work can extend this part too : more detailed analysis of clinical data using statistical methods and diﬀerent param - eter selection techniques is required . One of the possible directions is to use feature selection based on genetic algorithms as was proposed in [ 57 ] . Another raised problem is the interpretation of algorithm decision - making . Since the neural network is a kind of “black - box” it is necessary to apply the advanced interpretation techniques of such methods . This point will be addressed in future work . Considering the complexity of ML / DL methods , it is reasonable to experiment with other techniques , for example , fuzzy similarities [ 58 , 59 ] . Lastly , based on the received information on the patient and his treatment , the work can be extended by evaluating the severity and duration of the post - acute phase . 5 . Conclusion Prevention , diagnostics , and treatment of COVID - 19 have improved signiﬁcantly in recent years . However , severe cases may lead to long - term complications that may increase worldwide morbidity . One of the most severe complications is PF , which can be preventively treated us - ing CS . Unfortunately , CS treatment has severe side eﬀects , and the non - selected application of CS is considered harmful . Currently , no methodology can identify people who will beneﬁt from the treatment and who will not . This work introduced a novel , personalized AI - based methodology for CS treatment prescription during the post - acute phase of COVID - 19 . For the design of the methodology , we collected data from a total of 273 patients , which consist of more than 100 diﬀerent parameters for each person . It includes data that were collected at the ﬁrst examination of post - COVID treatment ( blood tests , spirometry test , anamnesis , and CXR images ) , which is , regarding its detail , the largest reported dataset . The proposed methodology is based on a neural network architec - ture pre - trained on a large dataset of pulmonary diseases ChestX - ray14 . In this way , the neural network can extract the relevant features from input images . The ﬁrst experiment is based on the processing of a CXR image by NN and the traditional ML algorithm with optimization , which was applied to get the ﬁnal decision on the necessity of CS treatment . The second experiment has the additional part : clinical data concate - nated to the NN output for the ﬁnal decision . Here results from CXR and a combination of CXR with clinical in - formation were evaluated . We demonstrated that combining CXR and clinical information achieves signiﬁcantly better results ( 78 . 7 % ) . The proposed methodology can be used in real - world practice . It can assist physicians in identifying individuals who need CS treatment . For sure , this ﬁeld of research is promising . It can help improve the speed of the patient’s examination , and more people would get personalized medical care and avoid overtreatment of patients who will not beneﬁt from the treatment . The same principle may be applied to other diseases with a risk of PF development ( e . g . , organizing pneumonia , acute respi - ratory distress syndrome , or drug - induced lung involvement ) . This way , the pandemic of COVID - 19 may give us lessons for future applications of AI .
