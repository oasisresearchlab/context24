It has been known for decades that blood group O individuals suffer more severe symptoms of cholera compared with individuals with other blood groups ( A , B and AB ) . The observed blood group dependence is likely to be caused by the major virulence factor of Vibrio cholera e , the cholera toxin ( CT ) . Here , we investigate the binding of ABH blood group determinants to both classical and El Tor CTB - pentamers using saturation transfer differ - ence NMR and show that all three blood group determi - nants bind to both toxin variants . Although the details of the interactions differ , we see no large differences between the two toxin genotypes and observe very similar binding constants . We also show that the blood group determinants bind to a site distinct from that of the primary receptor , GM1 . Transferred NOESY data con ﬁ rm that the conforma - tions of the blood group determinants in complex with both toxin variants are similar to those of reported X - ray and solution structures . Taken together , this detailed analysis provides a framework for the interpretation of the epi - demiological data linking the severity of cholera infection and an individual ’ s blood group , and brings us one step closer to understanding the molecular basis of cholera blood group dependence . Keywords : ABH blood group determinants / binding af ﬁ nity / cholera blood group dependence / cholera toxin / nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( STD and tr - NOESY ) Introduction Cholera is a life - threatening disease caused by the pathogenic bacterium Vibrio cholerae . The disease is caused by a secreted protein , the cholera toxin ( CT ) , which consists of a heterohexa - mer formed by one toxic A - subunit ( CTA ) anchored in the middle of a ring formed by ﬁ ve B - subunits ( CTB ) . The B - pentamer is re - sponsible for targeting the toxin to human intestinal epithelial cells by binding to the GM1 ganglioside ( Gal β 3GalNAc β 4 [ NeuAc α 3 ] Gal β 4Glc β Cer ) present on their surface . Binding of the toxin results in its internalization , and the release of the CTA subunit , which through a cascade of events ultimately leads to extreme diarrhea , and if untreated , death as a result of such rapid dehy - dration . The two major biotypes of cholera are Classical and El Tor , which produce toxins that typically differ only by two residues in their B - subunits at positions 18 and 47 ( Y18 and I47 in El Tor , H18 and T47 in classical CTB ( cCTB ) ) ( Sánchez and Holmgren 2008 ) . The severity of cholera symptoms , particularly for the El Tor biotype , has been reported to depend upon the patient ’ s blood group ( Clemens et al . 1989 ; Harris et al . 2005 , 2008 ) . Blood type is , in part , determined by the ABH antigens , oligosacchar - ides expressed on cell surfaces , including those of the gastro - intestinal tract . These three antigens de ﬁ ne the blood groups A , B and O , respectively . They contain a common 2 - O - fucosyl - galactoside structure ( as in H - tetrasaccharide 1 , Figure 1 ) , which is further substituted towards the non - reducing end by an α - galactosamine residue ( in A - pentasaccharide 2 , Figure 1 ) or an α - galactose ( in B - pentasaccharide 3 , Figure 1 ) . Blood group O individuals , carrying the H - antigen , appear to be more at risk of developing severe cholera than those of other blood groups ( Barua and Paguio 1977 ; Chaudhuri and De 1977 ; Glass et al . 1985 ; Swerdlow et al . 1994 ) . This appears to be related to the toxin B - pentamer structure . Previous crystallographic studies revealed a secondary binding site in a CTB homolog , the human heat - labile enterotoxin from Escherichia coli ( hLTB ) ( Holmner et al . 2007 ) as well as in a CTB / hLTB chimera ( Holmner et al . 2004 ) , which was able to interact with blood group oligosaccharides . These structural investigations showed the A type 2 - antigen analog 2b ( Figure 1 ) binding to the toxin B - pentamers in a region which includes residues 18 and 47 ( Y18 and T47 in hLTB and in the CTB / hLTB chimera ) . In the crystal structures , the Tyr18 hydroxyl group was found to exhibit strong van der Waals interactions with the reducing end Glc β of 2b and to coordinate a conserved water network at this site ( Holmner et al . 2004 ) . This suggested that the El Tor CTB ( possessing Y18 ) could be capable of stronger interactions 4 Present address : Department of Chemistry , Biotechnology and Food Science , Norwegian University of Life Sciences , PO Box 5003 , NO - 1432 Ås , Norway . 1 To whom correspondence should be addressed : Tel : + 39 - 0250314092 ; Fax : + 39 - 0250314092 ; e - mail : anna . bernardi @ unimi . it ( A .

( 1989 ) . However , more recently , we have reported preliminary studies performed using surface plasmon resonance ( SPR ) and NMR spectroscopy showing that both El Tor and classical CTB - pentamers bind blood group determinants H and Awith similar af ﬁ nities , although with dif - ferent kinetics ( Heggelund et al . 2012 ) . Concurrently , Turnbull and coworkers ( Mandal et al . 2012 ) reported isothermal titra - tion calorimetry ( ITC ) and NMR studies for the interaction of β - glycosides of H - and B - antigen analogs 1a and 3a , with El Tor CTB and hLTB , showing that the H - antigen analog binds to both El Tor CTB and hLTB . Surprisingly , the B - antigen analog 3a was found to bind only to hLTB but not to El Tor CTB . However , a single - point mutation at position 47 in El Tor CTB ( I47T ) restored the B - antigen - binding activity of the protein , which suggested a strong role for this residue in the interaction . Here we report a comprehensive analysis using saturation transfer difference NMR ( STD - NMR ) and transferred NOESY ( tr - NOESY ) experiments ( Dalvit 2009 ; Meyer and Peters 2003 ) to examine the interactions of cCTB and El Tor CTB with analogs of all three blood group determinants H - tetra , A - penta and B - penta ( compounds 1b , 2b and 3b , respectively , Figure 1 ) . In all cases , the STD spectra showed clear interactions with both proteins and indicated that each oligosaccharide binds to the two different CTB - pentamers in a similar orientation . We observed some small but signi ﬁ cant differences in the atomic details of the interaction of the three antigen analogs with either El Tor or cCTB , but the estimated K d values for the complexes are very similar . The tr - NOESY data support a binding con - formation consistent with that observed in the X - ray structure of the A - antigen analog 2b bound to hLTB ( Holmner et al . 2007 ) . In addition , we have shown , through competition experi - ments , that the blood group H - tetrasaccharide 1b and the GM1 oligosaccharide ( GM1 - os , 4 , Figure 1 ) bind at different sites on cCTB , as already suggested by Mandal et al . ( 2012 ) for El Tor CTB . Thus , this work offers a comprehensive frame for in - terpretation of the epidemiological analysis analysis linking cholera and blood type . Results The interaction of 1b – 3b ( Figure 1 ) with CTB was studied by STD - NMR and tr - NOESY . STD - NMR is one of the most used NMR methods to study the interactions between oligosacchar - ides and macromolecular receptors ( Meyer and Peters 2003 ; Fig . 1 . Structures of the blood group antigen oligosaccharides 1 – 3 and the GM1 oligosaccharide 4 ( GM1 - os ) .

The technique helps identifying the epitope group of the ligands , revealing which moieties are closest to the receptor in the bound state . It is based on the transfer of magnetization from the protein to the bound ligand , which , by exchange , is released into solution where it is detected . The degree of saturation of individual ligand protons ( expressed as absolute - STD percentage ) re ﬂ ects their proximity to the protein surface and can be used to describe the ligand – target interactions . In addition to epitope mapping , K d values can be estimated from STD - NMR experiments . In fact , the STD intensity , which depends on the fraction of bound ligand , can be converted into the STD ampli ﬁ cation factor ( STD - AF ) , which is a function of the fraction of bound protein ( Mayer and Meyer 1999 , 2001 ) . The evolution of the STD - AF along a ligand titration series enables the construction of a saturation curve , and the value of K d results from mathematical ﬁ tting of the experimental curve . An NMR spectroscopic technique complementary to STD is tr - NOESY ( Meyer et al . 1997 ; Haselhorst et al . 1999 ; Mayer and Meyer 2000 ; Post 2003 ) . The observation of tr - NOEs relies on the different behavior of a small ligand molecule free in solu - tion , rather than bound to a receptor protein . A ligand bound to a large molecular - weight protein behaves as part of the large mol - ecule and adopts the corresponding NOE behavior , showing strong negative NOEs , so - called tr - NOEs . Binding of a ligand to a receptor protein can thus easily be distinguished by looking at the sign of the observed NOEs . These tr - NOEs re ﬂ ect the bound conformation of the ligand , so that data can be inferred about the conformational equilibrium of the ligand during the binding event . Ligand interaction studies by saturation transfer difference and 1 H NMR The complete 1 H and 13 C NMR spectral assignments of free compounds 1b – 3b are provided in Supplementary data , Table S1 . All compounds are present as an equilibrium α / β anomeric mixture of the reducing end glucose . The STD - NMR experi - ments were performed on soluble classical and El Tor CTB in the presence of antigen analogs 1b – 3b in phosphate buffer at 298 K . STD spectra of the ligands in the absence of the CTB - pentamers did not show any signals . However , when the ligand complexes were analyzed , only signals resulting from the transfer of saturation from the protein receptor to the ligand protons were observed , thus permitting immediate mapping of the epitope . In all cases , clear binding was observed and binding constants could be determined from STD growth curves ( Meyer and Peters 2003 ) . Only one saturation time was selected for the data analysis , which allows only for a qualitative determination of binding epitopes . Indeed , the STD - NMR spectra showed rather low intensities that precluded a more quantitative approach using STD build - up curves , to avoid effects of different relax - ation times ( Mayer and James 2004 ) and rebinding effects ( Angulo et al . 2008 ) . However , the comparative nature of this study , both in terms of carbohydrate ligands and protein bio - types , supports the relevance of the qualitative approach used here . The absolute STD values obtained for 1b – 3b in the presence of cCTB and El Tor ( ET CTB ) are shown in Figure 2 . STD values of overlapping signals were not included . In all cases , the highest STD signal was obtained for the anomeric proton of the reducing - end glucose . This is most likely an artifact , due to interaction with water , and indeed these signals signi ﬁ cantly change in intensity , depending on the use of water suppression sequences . Therefore , relative STD values were calculated for each of the molecules based on the second strongest signal . The relative STD values obtained with cCTB and El Tor CTB are shown in Figure 3 . The relevant features of the interaction are discussed for each compound in the following sections . Blood group H tetrasaccharide Fuc α 2Gal β 4 [ Fuc α 3 ] Glc 1b The STD spectrum of H - tetra 1b in the presence of cCTB is shown in Figure 4 . Binding involves essentially the protons of the two fucose units , H1 - Fuc ( I ) ( 5 . 2 ppm ) and H1 - Fuc ( II ) ( 5 . 3 ppm ) ( Figures 2A and 3 ) . The signals of H2 - and H4 - Fuc ( I ) and H2 - and H4 - Fuc ( II ) also appear in the STD spectrum at 3 . 7 ppm , but cannot be quanti ﬁ ed due to overlapping signals and are thus not included in Figure 2A . The binding constant of H - tetra 1b to cCTB was calculated from a titration curve acquired by varying the H - tetrasaccharide concentration in the presence of the same amount of cCTB , which yielded a K d = 2 . 7 ± 1 . 0 mM . For El Tor CTB , the interaction with 1b occurs primarily via H1 Fuc ( I ) ( the most intense STD signal , 2 . 5 STD % ) , but also via H1 Fuc ( II ) ( 1 . 5 STD % ) ( Figures 2A and 3 ) , hence the binding strength is reversed between the two fucose residues compared with cCTB . Binding further involves the H3 proton of the glucose unit ( 1 . 1 STD % ) , an interaction not observed in the H - tetra / cCTB complex . The interaction of El Tor CTB was previously investigated by ITC and NMR by Mandal et al . for a slightly different H - tetra analog 1a ( Figure 1 ) containing GlcNAc rather than Glc at the reducing end and an alkyl linker ( R ) covalently attached to the anomeric position , yielding a K d value measured by ITC of 1 . 8 ± 0 . 2 mM ( Mandal et al . 2012 ) . Blood group H tetrasaccharide and GM1 - os can bind to classical CTB simultaneously In order to exclude the possibility that the H - tetrasaccharide binds to the cCTB subunits at the same site as GM1 - os ( i . e . the primary binding site ) , competition studies were performed both by tr - NOESY and STD NMR . The NOESY spectrum of H - tetra in phosphate buffer shows positive NOE contacts ( Figure 5A , red cross peaks ) . Addition of cCTB ( 1b / cCTB 20 : 1 ) to the solution results in negative NOE contacts in the tr - NOESY spectrum ( Figure 5B , black cross peaks ) , indicating the event of binding and allowing the determination of the bound conformation of the ligand . GM1 - os ( 4 , 1 : 1 molar ratio with 1b ) was then added to the mixture , and tr - NOESY spectra were recorded again ( Figure 5C ) . The binding af ﬁ nity of GM1 - os to cCTB was estimated as 43 nM by ITC ( Turnbull et al . 2004 ) , suggesting that GM1 - os could easily displace the weaker H - tetrasaccharide ligand ( K d in the mM range ) if there were competition for the same binding site , as observed before for competitive CTB ligands ( Bernardi et al . 2003 ) . The H - tetra cross peaks are negative in Figure 5C , showing that 1b is not displaced from its binding site by GM1 - os , and indicating that both compounds can interact simultaneously with CTB at their respective binding sites . F Vasile et al . 768 D o w n l oaded f r o m h tt p s : / / a c ade m i c . oup . c o m / g l yc ob / a r t i c l e - ab s t r a c t / 24 / 8 / 766 / 2900475 b y gue s t on 07 J anua r y 2019 This is supported by the STD spectra acquired from the same sample and clearly showing the simultaneous presence of the Fuc anomeric signals of H - tetra 1b ( 5 . 2 and 5 . 3 ppm ) and of the H3 - NeuAc signal of GM1 - os at 1 . 95 ppm ( Figure 6 ) . A titration at different H - tetra concentrations ( maintaining a ﬁ xed concentration of CTB and GM1 - os ) , yielded a K d value of 3 . 0 mM , unchanged from the value measured for the inter - action in the absence of GM1 - os . This is further evidence that GM1 and blood group antigens bind to CTB at different sites and corroborate the observations of Mandal et al . ( 2012 ) for 1a / El Tor CTB . Blood group A pentasaccharide GalNAc α 3 [ Fuc α 2 ] Gal β 4 [ Fuc α 3 ] Glc 2b Preliminary results investigating the interaction of A - penta 2b with cCTB have been reported previously ( Heggelund et al . 2012 ) . In brief , the STD spectra of 2b acquired in the presence of cCTB ( Figure 7A and B ) indicate that the protons of the oligosaccharide that are more involved in interactions with the toxin are H1 - GalNAc , H5 - Fuc ( II ) , H1 - Fuc ( II ) , H1 - Fuc ( I ) and Ac - GalNAc ( 2 . 0 , 1 . 3 , 1 . 1 , 1 . 1 and 1 . 0 absolute STD values , re - spectively ) ( Figure 2B ) . In addition , in the STD spectrum other signals belonging to the GalNAc , Gal , Fuc ( I ) and Fuc ( II ) Fig . 2 . Absolute STD values and calculated K d values for ABH antigen analogs .

The relative STD values , grouped in four intensity ranges , are reported in Figure 3 . The titration of A - penta in the presence of 43 μ M cCTB yielded a K d of 5 . 2 ± 0 . 8 mM . This value is compatible with the value obtained previously by SPR ( 1 . 2 ± 0 . 3 mM ) ( Heggelund et al . 2012 ) , especially given that overestimation of Fig . 3 .

A - penta 2b was also studied in the presence of El Tor CTB ( Figure 7B and C ) . Absolute and relative STD values are shown in Figures 2B and 3 . A comparison of the STD spectra acquired for both biotypes suggests that A - penta binds both proteins in a similar fashion , although with several important differences . When comparing the interactions of A - penta 2b with the toxin B - pentamers of the different biotypes , the STD signals are in general less intense for the 2b / El Tor CTB complex com - pared with the cCTB complex ( Figure 2B ) . Additionally , al - though the H1 - GalNAc proton remains the most intense STD signal in both spectra , all other GalNAc proton signals are missing in the 2b / El Tor CTB spectrum . Furthermore , the strong signal observed for H5 - Fuc ( II ) / cCTB is missing in the 2b / El Tor CTB spectrum . Despite these atomic - level differences , the K d value for the A - penta / El Tor CTB complex is 6 . 4 ± 2 . 1 mM , very similar to the value for 2b / cCTB . Blood group B pentasaccharide Gal α 3 [ Fuc α 2 ] Gal β 4 [ Fuc α 3 ] Glc 3b The STD spectrum of B - penta 3b , acquired in the presence of cCTB ( Figure 8A ) , shows interactions similar to those observed for the A - antigen analog 2b , involving principally the two fucose units , the blood group B - speci ﬁ c Gal ( II ) , and the reducing end glucose residue ( Figures 2C , 3 and 8A and B ) . A titration with in - creasing concentrations of B - penta in the presence of 43 μ M cCTB yielded a dissociation constant K d of 7 . 2 ± 1 . 6 mM . When B - penta was studied in the presence of El Tor CTB , STD signals were also clearly observed ( Figure 8C ) , and abso - lute values could be quantitatively calculated ( Figure 2C ) . A K d of 8 . 1 ± 2 . 3 mM was obtained , compared with cCTB . Only Fig . 5 . H - tetra and GM1 - os interact with cCTB simultaneously .

Otherwise , most of the absolute and relative STD values are very similar , although generally less intense for El Tor CTB ( Figures 2C and 3 ) , except for H1 - Gal ( II ) and H1 - Fuc ( II ) , where the opposite pattern was observed . The strongest interactions involve the two fucose units and the galactose residue Gal ( II ) characteristic of blood group B - antigens and , for cCTB , H2 - Glc . The observation made here that both classical and El Tor CTB bind to B - penta is consistent with previous preliminary experiments using surface plasmon resonance , where B - penta 3b was found to bind to El Tor CTB ( Heggelund et al . 2012 ) , although cCTB was not tested for binding in the previous study . These observations are con ﬂ icting with a recent report by Turnbull and coworkers , who found that the B - pentasaccharide glycoside 3a does not interact with El Tor CTB , except when Ile47 is replaced with Thr47 of the classical sequence ( Mandal et al . 2012 ) . Conformational studies by tr - NOESY To investigate the bound conformation of 1b – 3b , tr - NOESY experiments were performed with both toxins . Details of these studies are described in Supplementary data . In brief , the tr - NOESY spectra obtained in the presence of either classical or El Tor CTB were similar to one another and to the spectra of the free sugars . The solution conformation of blood group anti - gens has been studied in careful detail ( Yuriev et al . 2005 and references therein ; see Supplementary data for additional refer - ences ) , and it can be described in all cases by one major con - former . This is maintained upon binding to either toxin . For B - penta 3b in complex with cCTB , only one additional NOE contact was observed ( H5 - Fuc ( I ) / H2 - Gal ) , indicating that in the bound form , Fucose ( I ) has a lower degree of mobility than in the free form and suggesting the selection of a more rigid conformation . For the A - antigen analog 2b , the conformation supported by tr - NOESY experiments corresponds to the one observed in the X - ray structures ( PDB ID : 3EFX , Holmner et al . 2004 and PDB ID : 2O2L , Holmner et al . 2007 ; Figure 9 ) . Summary of interactions : Comparison of cholera biotypes All three blood group antigen analogs interact with both clas - sical and El Tor CTB - pentamers , with dissociation constants in the millimolar range . Despite the two amino acid substitutions ( H18Y and T47I ; cCTB to El Tor CTB ) , the binding constants are equivalent within error limits for the two biotypes , with H - tetra 1b showing the strongest binding , followed by A - penta 2b , and B - penta 3b showing the weakest binding . The blood group antigen - binding site is distinct from the GM1 binding site and presumably corresponds to the binding site identi ﬁ ed for the A - analog 2b in the X - ray crystal structures of hLTB ( Holmner et al . 2007 ) and the CTB / hLTB chimera Fig . 8 .

The two fucose residues are involved in the binding of both biotypes for all three blood group antigens , with the H1 atoms playing a dominant role , whereas the central galactose residue only contributes to the binding of the A - and B - determinants ( Figures 2 and 3 ) . The GalNAc and Gal resi - dues characteristic of A - and B - determinants , respectively , are involved in blood group antigen binding independent of the biotype . In each case , however , the intensity , number and exact positions of the STD contacts vary . The atomic details of the variations are clearly visible for A - penta GalNAc , which shows multiple STD contacts with cCTB ( H1 - , H2 - , H5 - , Ac - GalNAc ) and a single contact ( H1 - GalNAc ) with El Tor CTB ( Figure 2B ) . In the crystal struc - ture of 2b in the CTB / hLTB chimera ( Figure 9 ; PDB ID : 3EFX , Holmner et al . 2004 ) , which like cCTB features a threonine residue at position 47 , the GalNAc residue is positioned near Thr47 and binds to the protein mainly through water - mediated interactions , and through two H - bonds of the GalNAc N - acetyl nitrogen to Gly45 O and Thr47 OG1 . The lower resolution structure of hLTB ( T47 ) in complex with this ligand ( PDB ID : 2O2L , Holmner et al . 2007 ) shows the same interactions . It is not clear how a substitution of Thr47 for Ile47 in El Tor CTB would affect ligand binding . The substitution of Thr47 for Ile in its preferred rotamer conformation ( Figure 9 ) suggests that Fig . 9 . Modeled antigen interactions .

The ligand and selected amino acid residues are given in stick representation , while the protein is shown as a surface representation ( with different colors for the individual B - subunits ) . The ﬁ gure was generated based on the crystal structures of cCTB ( PDB ID : 3CHB , Merritt et al . 1998 ) and the ligand complex of a CTB / hLTB chimera ( PDB ID : 3EFX , Holmner et al . 2004 ) . The two residues differing between classical and El Tor CTB ( 18 , 47 ) are shown in purple ( classical ) and green ( El Tor ) , with Ile47 being introduced manually in its preferred rotamer conformation ( insert : collage of CTB binding to the A - pentasaccharide ( light gray ) and GM1 - os ( turquoise ) ) .

Note that the orientation of the blood group determinant is opposite to the conventional orientation shown in Figure 1 , since CTB is displayed in its standard view , with the GM1 binding site facing down towards the cell surface .

( 2012 ) observed no binding of this protein variant to a blood group B - determinant . The STD spectra of 2b further reveal small differences between the two biotypes in the region of Fuc ( II ) and , to some extent , Gal . Several contacts , most notably that of H5 - Fuc ( II ) , are only observed for one of the protein variants . On the other hand , Fuc ( I ) and Glc , which in the published crystal structures are in the proximity of residue 18 ( Holmner et al . 2004 , 2007 ) , are not affected . In the CTB / hLTB chimera ( PDB ID : 3EFX , Holmner et al . 2004 ) , Tyr18 coordinates a water network ( Figure 9B ) , which is of signi ﬁ cant importance for glucose binding of 2b . In cCTB , Tyr18 is replaced by the smaller His18 which is unlikely to form a similar network . However , this does not necessarily prevent the interaction from occurring . The absolute STD values measured for the fucose residues are essentially the same for A - penta 2b and B - penta 3b with either protein ( H1 - Fuc ( I ) , H6 - Fuc ( I ) , H1 - Fuc ( II ) , H6 - Fuc ( II ) , Figure 2B and C ) . The signal of H5 - Fuc ( II ) , which is strong in the STD spectrum of 2b , could not be analyzed for B - penta 3b due to overlapping signals ( at 4 . 71 ppm ) . Some differences between the analogs are associated with the different residues ( GalNAc and Gal ) at the non - reducing end of each sugar and with the terminal Glc H2 proton . Another small difference con - cerns H3 - Fuc ( II ) . It is worth repeating that these differences do not lead to major changes in the measured K d values , which are at the upper limit available to the technique . Discussion In the quest to understand the molecular mechanisms for the observed blood group dependence of cholera , a number of dif - ferent methods have been used , including protein crystallog - raphy ( Holmner et al . 2004 , 2007 ) , NMR ( Heggelund et al . 2012 ; Mandal et al . 2012 ) and quantitative - binding studies by SPR ( Heggelund et al . 2012 ) or ITC ( Mandal et al . 2012 ) . Both classical and El Tor CTB have been investigated , in addition to a CTB / hLTB chimera , which contains Tyr18 , Thr47 and the CTB - speci ﬁ c residue Asn4 ( Holmner et al . 2004 ) . The tested ligands are analogs of the A , B and H blood group determinants A Lewis - y , B Lewis - y and Lewis - y . A and B Lewis - y represent the epitopes on the glycosphingolipids from the human small intestinal epithelium that tested binding positive in an initial study ( Ångström et al . 2000 ) and are commonly found in the small intestinal mucosa , especially in secretors ( Ravn and Dabelsteen 2000 ) . In our current work , we expanded our inves - tigation of the potential involvement of CTB in the cholera blood group dependence phenomenon using NMR , in particu - lar STD and tr - NOESY . These are very versatile and sensitive methodologies that utilize NOE effects to investigate the inter - action between protein and ligand . We con ﬁ rmed that binding of the blood group oligosaccharides occurs at a site distinct from the primary GM1 binding site and showed that all three blood group antigen analogs ( H - tetra 1b , A - penta 2b and B - penta 3b ) bind to the El Tor CTB as well as to cCTB . This is in contrast to the recent report by Turnbull and cowor - kers ( Mandal et al . 2012 ) , who observed , using STD and ITC , that only a β - glycoside of the H - tetrasaccharide 1a , but not the corresponding β - glycoside of the B - pentasaccharide 3a bound to CTB El Tor . This raises the question as to why two studies have produced such contrasting data for the interaction of the B - antigen interaction with CTB . Disregarding any potential technical problems with the STD experiments , the most likely cause for the difference is the different oligosaccharides investi - gated , as the recombinant constructs for El Tor CTB were iden - tical ( generously provided to us by T . Hirst , through the hands of B . Turnbull ) . The oligosaccharides used in our study are from human milk 1b – 3b , which lack the N - acetyl group of GlcNAc and are used as anomeric mixtures at the reducing end residue . This choice was dictated by the commercial availability of compounds in earlier experiments ( Holmner et al . 2004 , 2007 ) . The Turnbull group employed synthetic analogs 1a and 3a ( Figure 1 ) , which contain the terminal N - acetyl group and in addition feature a 3 - methyloxycarbonylaminopropyl group ( R ) covalently attached to the anomeric position of GlcNAc , locking the anomeric carbon in the β - con ﬁ guration . Non - binding could hence depend either on the additional N - acetyl group of GlcNAc or on the alkyl linker attached to the anomeric position of the reducing end sugar . The published crystal struc - tures do not indicate any potential clash for the N - acetyl group , which in fact was mistakenly included in the original structural model of the CTB / hLTB chimera ( PDB ID : 3EFX , Holmner et al . 2004 ) . However , this structure featured Thr and not Ile at position 47 at the other end of the binding site ( see Figure 9 ) , and Turnbull and coworkers convincingly showed that they were able to restore the binding activity of the El Tor CTB for their B - analog by the substitution I47T ( Thr being the classical residue ) ( Mandal et al . 2012 ) . The CTB / hLTB chimera further showed signi ﬁ cantly increased binding af ﬁ nity to blood group A - and B - antigens in microtiter well assays compared with cCTB ( Ångström et al . 2000 ) , which features a histidine residue at position 18 . These studies , however , were undertaken with glycosphingolipids rather than with blood group oligosac - charides . Together , these studies suggest that both Tyr18 and Thr47 correlate with enhanced binding , whereas His18 and Ile47 may correlate with weaker binding . The combinations His18 / Thr47 and Tyr18 / Ile47 , as found in classical and El Tor CTB , respectively , may then compensate to yield a moderate effect , explaining why we obtained virtually identical binding constants for A - and B - penta , to either cCTB or El Tor CTB . V . cholerae strains that produce a toxin featuring both Tyr18 and Thr47 have also been reported , such as for some O139 Bengal strains circulating between 1999 and 2005 ( Bhuiyan et al . 2009 ) ; however , to the best of our knowledge , they have not been analyzed with respect to blood group dependence . When comparing the atomic details of binding interactions of the different blood group oligosaccharides to the two CTB variants , some differences were observed . For B - penta , the main difference in interaction intensity was observed at the re - ducing end of the oligosaccharide , which is expected to bind in the proximity of residue 18 of the protein in accordance with previous studies ( Holmner et al . 2004 , 2007 ) . It is at the redu - cing end of the oligosaccharide , where the B - antigen analog investigated by us differs from the analog studied by Turnbull and coworkers ( Mandal et al . 2012 ) . For A - penta , the strongest differences were found at the non - reducing end , close to residue 47 at the interface to the neighboring toxin B - subunit . NMR study of blood group antigen binding to cholera toxin 775 D o w n l oaded f r o m h tt p s : / / a c ade m i c . oup . c o m / g l yc ob / a r t i c l e - ab s t r a c t / 24 / 8 / 766 / 2900475 b y gue s t on 07 J anua r y 2019 While the structural changes caused by the amino acid substitu - tions are expected to be small , they may affect the ligand orien - tation , with consequences for ligand interactions at the other end of the binding site . Furthermore , the different binding kinetics of A - or B - compared with H - determinants ( as seen by SPR ; Heggelund et al . 2012 ) suggest that also adjustments of the subunits within the B - pentamer might occur , within a deli - cate balance of binding interactions . In conclusion , the observed interaction of all three blood group antigen analogs tested here ( H - tetra , A - penta and B - penta ) with both classical and El Tor CTB provides evidence that also the natural blood group antigens can interact with CTB . Although a trend is clearly visible in the measured K d ( K d of H - tetra < K d of A - penta < K d of B - penta ) , the small differ - ence in binding af ﬁ nities for the three blood group determinants is unlikely to cause a large biological effect . We still contend that the blood group dependence associated with cholera sever - ity is likely to occur due to the difference in kinetics as previ - ously reported ( Heggelund et al . 2012 ) . At present , we cannot explain why El Tor cholera should show a stronger blood group dependence than the classical disease , but we note that the data excluding classical cholera ( Clemens et al . 1989 ) have a small sample size . Furthermore , El Tor strains of V . cholerae O1 in Bangladesh have , since 2001 , been observed to produce the classical CT genotype ( Nair et al . 2006 ) , while blood group dependence is continuing to be reported ( Harris et al . 2005 , 2008 ) , suggesting that there is no statistically signi ﬁ cant differ - ence in blood group dependence between CT genotypes . The secretor status of the individuals is more likely to be an import - ant determining factor in cholera severity , as the presence of blood group antigens in the mucus layer can have a protective effect against cholera , in particular for blood group A and B individuals ( Chaudhuri and DasAdhikary 1978 ; Arifuzzaman et al . 2011 ) . A similar effect may underlie the protection con - ferred by fucosylated human milk oligosaccharides against diarrhea in breastfed infants ( Newburg et al . 2004 ; Blank et al . 2012 ) . Furthermore , with (cid:1) 80 % of the normal Indian popula - tion being secretor positive ( Chaudhuri and DasAdhikary 1978 ) , secretor status is likely to have strongly contributed to shaping the extreme blood group distribution in present Bangladesh . As the ancestral home of cholera and in addition a region endemic to malaria , which disproportionally affects blood group A individuals , this may explain why Bangladesh exhibits one of the highest incidences of the otherwise rare type B blood allele in the world . Materials and methods The blood group antigen analogs H - tetra , A - penta and B - penta were purchased from Elicityl ( catalog number GLY066 , GLY067 and GLY068 , respectively ) . Protein Production and sample preparation Lyophilized cCTB was purchased from Sigma – Aldrich con - taining Tris buffer salts , NaCl , NaN 3 and Na 2 EDTA . The powder was dissolved in D 2 O , resulting in cCTB in 0 . 05 M Tris buffer , 0 . 2 M NaCl , 0 . 003 M NaN 3 and 0 . 001 M Na 2 EDTA , pH 7 . 5 . The signals of Tris and EDTA fall in the same region as the signals of the ligand , so the sample was ultra ﬁ ltered using a Millipore Amicon Ultra - 4 centrifugal ﬁ lter unit ( MWCO 5000 Da ) , and the buffer was changed to phosphate buffer ( 20 mM , NaH 2 PO 4 / Na 2 HPO 4 ) at pH 7 . 5 in D 2 O . El Tor CTB was prepared as previously described ( Heggelund et al . 2012 ) . Brie ﬂ y , the protein was overexpressed in Vibrio sp . 60 , grown in LBS medium ( LB medium with 15 g / l NaCl ) at 30°C , 160 rpm , supplemented with 100 μ L / mL ampicillin , until OD600 reached 0 . 2 . After induction with 0 . 5 mM IPTG , the cultures were grown for additional 16 – 20 h . The CTB is naturally secreted into the growth medium , and after removal of bacteria by centrifugation , the supernatant was puri ﬁ ed by af ﬁ n - ity chromatography . The protein was captured by the immobi - lized D - galactose gel ( Thermo Scienti ﬁ c ) and eluted using a galactose gradient . After dialysis against 0 . 1 M MES pH 6 . 0 , the protein was further puri ﬁ ed by ion exchange chromatog - raphy ( HiTrap ™ SP XL , GE Healthcare ) using an NaCl gradi - ent . Finally , the puri ﬁ ed CTB was dialyzed against a storage buffer ( 20 mM Tris – HCl , 200 mM NaCl , pH 7 . 5 ) and concen - trated to 9 . 5 mg / mL . Prior to the NMR studies , the buffer was changed to phosphate buffer at pH 7 . 5 in D 2 O , as described for cCTB . NMR experiments Each sample was prepared in a 3 - mm NMR tube using different ligand concentrations ( from 1 to 20 mM ) in the presence of 43 or 46 μ M cCTB , depending on the experiment , or 34 μ M El Tor CTB , in 180 μ L phosphate buffer ( 20 mM , NaH 2 PO 4 / Na 2 HPO 4 ) at pH 7 . 5 in D 2 O . The spectra were acquired with a Bruker Avance 600 MHz instrument at 298 K . For the complete assignment of the mole - cules and the conformational analysis , the following experi - ments were used : 1D , COSY , TOCSY with a mixing time of 60 ms , NOESY with mixing times of 200 and 700 ms , 1 H , 13 C HSQC ( J = 145 Hz ) . In the presence of an intense unwanted water signal at 4 . 7 ppm , solvent suppression was achieved by use of an excitation sculpting pulse sequence . The spectrum shows two set of signals ( 1 : 1 ratio ) due to the presence of an equilibrium α / β anomeric mixture of the reducing end glucose . The STD spectra were performed with an on - resonance ir - radiation frequence at − 0 . 05 or − 0 . 5 ppm , while 200 ppm was chosen as off - resonance frequence . The experiments were per - formed at different temperatures ( 283 – 298K ) , but the best results were obtained at 298 K . Selective presaturation of the protein was achieved by a train of Gauss shaped pulses , each of 49 ms in length . STD experi - ments were acquired with 0 . 98 or 2 . 94 s of total saturation times . The STD sequence was obtained from standard Bruker library and water suppression was achieved by using the WATERGATE 3 - 9 - 19 pulse sequence .
