During bacterial infection , lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) potently activates the migration of macrophages via the NF - κ B / iNOS / c - Src signaling pathway . However , the downstream region of c - Src that participates in mac - rophage migration is unclear . EFhd2 , a novel actin bundling protein , was evaluated for its role in LPS - stimulated macrophage migration in this study . We found that LPS stimulated the up - regulation , tyrosine phosphorylation and membrane translocation of EFhd2 in macrophages . The absence of EFhd2 inhibited the recruitment of macrophages in the lungs of LPS - induced septic mice . LPS - induced macrophage migration was neutralized by the deletion of EFhd2 . EFhd2 - mediated up - regulation of NFPs ( including Rac1 / Cdc42 , N - WASP / WAVE2 and Arp2 / 3 complex ) induced by LPS could be used to explain the role of EFhd2 in promoting actin polymerization . Furthermore , the puri ﬁ ed EFhd2 could directly promote actin polymerization in vitro . Dasatinib , a c - Src speci ﬁ c inhibitor , inhibited the up - regulation of EFhd2 stimulated by LPS . Therefore , our study demonstrated that EFhd2 might be involved in LPS - stimulated macrophage migration , which provides a potential target for LPS - activated c - Src during macrophage mobilization . 1 . Introduction The ability of monocytes / macrophages to migrate to the site of in - fection or in ﬂ ammation is a crucial process in the developing innate immune response [ 1 , 2 ] . Classically , pro - in ﬂ ammatory signals ( in - cluding pro - in ﬂ ammatory cytokines and microbial molecules ) from in ﬂ amed foci induce monocyte emigration from the bone marrow , and circulating monocytes are targeted to in ﬂ ammatory sites by rolling , adhesion and cytoskeleton - driven transmigration of local endothelial cells depending on adhesion molecules and chemokines [ 3 , 4 ] . Substantially , the initial response of a cell to migration is to extend protrusions driven by actin cytoskeleton reorganization [ 5 ] . Actin polymerization is mediated by the actin - related protein ( Arp ) 2 / 3 complex , which is activated by actin nucleation promoting factors ( NPFs ) such as Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ) and WASP - family verprolin - homologous protein ( WAVE ) family members at the plasma membrane [ 6 , 7 ] . For migration to occur , a protrusion must still be stabilized by attaching to surrounding matrix , forming a new point of cell adhesion , such as though the interaction of myosin II with actin ﬁ laments [ 5 , 8 ] . Rho proteins are believed to be important for reg - ulating actomyosin contractility and actin polymerization by binding to Rho - associated coiled - coil forming protein kinase ( ROCK ) [ 5 ] . Myosin II activity is regulated by myosin light - chain ( MLC ) phosphorylation , which could be directly and positively regulated by ROCK [ 9 ] . Lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , a morbigenous component of the outer membrane of Gram - negative bacteria , is also known to cause actin cytoskeleton reorganization in a variety of cells , including macro - phages , which may directly contribute to the migration of monocytes / macrophages to the invaded region upon bacterial infection [ 10 , 11 ] . In vitro , LPS induces polarization , elongation and ru ﬄ ing of macrophage - like J774 cells and RAW264 . 7 cells as well as accelerated cell move - ment , and LPS - induced activation of macrophage motility is linked to reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton [ 10 , 12 ] . Src family kinases ( SFK ) , a family of non - receptor tyrosine kinases , phosphorylate and regulate the activity of NPFs that are required for actin polymerization [ 13 ] . For example , SFK activates N - WASP through tyrosine https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . intimp . 2017 . 12 . 030 Received 8 September 2017 ; Received in revised form 22 December 2017 ; Accepted 23 December 2017 ⁎ Corresponding authors . 1 Ye Tu and Lichao Zhang contributed equally to this study .

T phosphorylation , which can induce Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated actin polymerization [ 14 , 15 ] . SFK comprises nine proteins that share similar structural and biochemical properties . Among these subtypes , c - Src is barely detectable in resting macrophages . However , an enhancement of c - Src expression upon LPS stimulation implies that it may have an un - perceived role in transmitting LPS signaling [ 16 ] . In fact , LPS - mediated macrophage migration requires an enhancement of c - Src expression , which can be regulated by inducible nitric oxide synthase ( iNOS ) [ 17 , 18 ] . However , the molecular mechanism governing c - Src depen - dent migration of macrophage induced by LPS is unclear . Recently , EFhd2 was identi ﬁ ed as a novel actin bundling protein regulating cell spreading and migration in lymphocytes . EFhd2 was also found together with actin in the cytoskeleton fraction of human mast cells , NK - like cells and melanoma cells [ 19 , 20 ] . Morphologically , EFhd2 increased lamellipodia formation , whereas knock down of EFhd2 inhibited epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) - induced lamellipodia forma - tion , and led to a loss of actin stress ﬁ bers at the leading edges [ 21 ] . One possible mechanism is that EFhd2 strongly facilitates the formation of entangled or clustered F - actin by directly binding to F - actin and dose - dependently inhibiting co ﬁ lin - mediated actin depolymerization by preventing the binding of co ﬁ lin to F - actin [ 21 ] . In the current study , the expression of EFhd2 was identi ﬁ ed in murine peritoneal macro - phages and RAW264 . 7 cells , and its expression was up - regulated under LPS exposure . Therefore , it is easy to speculate that EFhd2 may also regulate actin polymerization and participate in the migration of macrophages . In this study , we observed the expression and distribution of EFhd2 in macrophage stimulated by LPS . Through a combination of loss - of - function and gain - of - function approaches , the e ﬀ ects of EFhd2 on cell migration , protrusion formation , cell spreading , actin polymerization , expression of Arp2 / 3 isoforms and NPFs were investigated . In addition , the regulation of c - Src on the expression of EFhd2 under LPS stimula - tion was studied . 2 . Materials and methods 2 . 1 . Materials LPS ( E . coli ) was purchased from Sigma ( St .

Mice C57BL / 6 mice were obtained from the Laboratory Animal Center of Second Military Medical University . Recombineering was used to gen - erate a gene - targeting construct from a bacterial arti ﬁ cial chromosome ( BAC ) containing the EFhd2 gene ( C57BL / 6 inbred strain ) . E14 ES cells were transfected with this construct , and successfully targeted ES cells were injected into C57BL / 6 blastocysts . Mice bearing this targeted al - lele of exon 2 – 4 deletion in the germline were bred to generate EFhd2 knockout mice [ 22 ] . All mice were housed and cared for in the Animal Care Facility at our Institution with free access to food and water . All protocols were approved by the Animal Care Committee at the Second Military Medical University . 2 . 3 . Sepsis model Sepsis was induced by single intraperitoneal ( i . p . ) injection of LPS ( 40 mg / kg ) . Clodronate liposome ( CLOP ) was used to deplete macro - phages of C57BL / 6J mice . Twenty - four hours after intravenous ( i . v . ) injection of CLOP ( 0 . 1 ml / 10 g ) , 3 × 10 7 peritoneal macrophages iso - lated from EFhd2 wild type ( WT ) of knock out ( KO ) mice were returned to macrophage - depleted mice before i . p . LPS . 2 . 4 . Cell culture Murine macrophage cell line RAW264 . 7 was obtained from the Type Culture Collection of the Chinese Academy of Sciences . Peritoneal macrophages were isolated from mice by peritoneal lavage 3 d after intraperitoneal injection with 3 % ( wt / vol ) thioglycollate . Cells were washed with PBS and used for migration or cultured overnight in Dulbecco ' s modi ﬁ ed Eagle ' s medium ( DMEM ) supplemented with 10 % ( v / v ) heat - inactivated fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) , 100 U / ml penicillin G , and streptomycin in a humidi ﬁ ed 37 °C , 5 % CO 2 incubator . 2 . 5 . Transwell migration assay As previously described before [ 23 ] , cells were stimulated with or without LPS for 12 h . Cells of each group were then added to the upper wells ( 24 - multiwell Corning Costar Transwell ) at a density of 1 × 10 5 per well . Migrating cells could pass through the polycarbonate ﬁ lter ( 8 μ m ) . Cells were ﬁ xed in 4 % paraformaldehyde for 10 min . The non - migratory cells were removed from the upper membrane surface care - fully with cotton sticks . After cells were stained with crystal violet and imaged by a ﬂ uorescence microscope with a 40× objective , the num - bers of migratory cells were counted in ﬁ ve areas chosen randomly for each membrane . Ex vivo , the migration of peritoneal macrophages isolated from LPS - induced septic mice was observed 3 h or 6 h after being implanted . 2 . 6 . G - actin / F - actin assay G - actin and F - actin were measured using the in vivo assay kit ac - cording to the manufacturer ' s directions . Brie ﬂ y [ 24 ] , macrophages were lysed in a detergent - based bu ﬀ er that stabilized and maintained the G and F forms of cellular actin . Only G - actin was solubilized by the bu ﬀ er , and after a centrifugation step , F - actin was pelleted , whereas G - actin remained in the supernatant . The F - actin was depolymerizated and aliquots of supernatant and pellet were analyzed by Western blot . 2 . 7 . F - actin polymerization assay As previously described [ 25 ] , we measured the change in ﬂ uores - cence intensity to analyze actin polymerization by using the Actin Polymerization Biochem Kit . First , 1 . 5 × polymerization bu ﬀ ers were prepared for the assay , and WASP - VCA Domain - GST Protein and Arp2 / 3 Protein Complex were pre - incubated as the positive control . The ﬁ nal Y . Tu et al . International Immunopharmacology 55 ( 2018 ) 263 – 271 264 concentrations of the proteins were as follows : 100 , 300 , and 1000 nM EFhd2 , 0 . 8 μ M pyrene actin , 10 nM Arp2 / 3 Complex and 400 nM WASP - VCA Domain - GST Protein . After establishing the ﬂ uorescence measurement baseline , protein was added to detect . Fluorescence in - tensity was detected by a Multifunctional Microplate Reader ( In ﬁ nite M200 , Tecan , M ā nnedorf , Switzerland ) . The excitation and emission wavelengths were 350 nm and 410 nm , respectively , and the entire detection process lasted 50 min . 2 . 8 . Immuno ﬂ uorescence Immuno ﬂ uorescence staining was performed as described pre - viously [ 26 ] . Isolated peritoneal macrophages in eight - well LabTek slides ( PEZGS0816 , Millipore , Billerica , Massachusetts , USA ) or lung sections were ﬁ xed in 4 % paraformaldehyde , blocked with 0 . 4 % Triton X - 100 / 2 % bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) at room temperature for 1 h , and then incubated with primary antibodies for EFhd2 ( 1 : 50 dilution ) and F4 / 80 ( 1 : 50 dilution ) overnight at 4 °C . After being washed with PBS 3 times , the samples were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 ( Jackson , Lancaster , Pennsylvania , USA ) and actin - stain 555 ﬂ uor - escent phalloidin for 1 h and washed again with PBS . Nuclei were stained with DAPI . Images were obtained by confocal microscopy ( TCS SP5 , Leica , Solms , Germany ) . To count macrophages , at least three vi - sual ﬁ elds were randomly selected for each lung slice and counted with ImageJ software . For measuring cell area , at least eight cells per ﬁ eld were randomly selected and analyzed with ImageJ software . 2 . 9 . Construction of EFhd2 over - expressed lentivirus Shanghai Innovation Biotechnology Co . synthesized the CDS se - quence ( residues 54 – 776 in the murine EFhd2 cDNA sequence , GenBank NM _ 025994 . 3 ) to construct recombinant lentivirus vector expressing EFhd2 . The viruses were concentrated by ultracentrifugation and titrated by infection of con ﬂ uent 293 T cells . 2 . 10 . Western blots Cells ( 2 × 10 6 ) were washed by pre - cooling PBS and then lysed in 80 μ l RIPA bu ﬀ er with protease inhibitors . After electrophoresis on SDS - PAGE gel with 30 μ g of protein per lane , proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose ﬁ lters and blocked with 5 % BSA compounded with PBST for 3 h at room temperature . The nitrocellulose membranes were incubated with various antibodies ( 1 : 1000 dilution ) overnight at 4 °C . The secondary antibodies ( 1 : 10 , 000 dilution ) were incubated for 50 min at room temperature . Finally , the proteins attached to the membrane were scanned by Odyssey ( LI - COR , Lincoln , Nebraska USA ) . 2 . 11 . Co - immunoprecipitation Co - immunoprecipitation was performed as previously described [ 27 ] . Cells were washed with PBS and then lysed in NP - 40 . Insoluble debris was cleared by centrifugation at 14 , 000 g for 15 min . Non - spe - ci ﬁ c background was removed by adding Protein G Beads . Added im - munoprecipitating antibody or mouse IgG in the protein lysate and incubated overnight at 4 °C . The lysate was mixed with Protein G Beads again overnight . The Protein G Beads were washed with PBS 3 times and boiled with 40 μ l 2 × sample bu ﬀ er for 5 min . Beads were removed by centrifugation at 14 , 000 g for 5 s . The supernatant was collected and used for Western blot . 2 . 12 .

Erythrocytes were lysed using Red Blood Cell Lysis Bu ﬀ er ( Beyotime , Shanghai , China ) . Macrophage counts were assessed by ﬂ ow cytometry ( BD Bioscience , New Jersey , USA ) analysis using F4 / 80 - PE ( eBioscience , Vienna , Austria ) and CD11b - FITC ( Bio - Legend , San Diego , CA ) ﬂ uorescent antibodies . 2 . 13 . Statistical analysis Data processing was performed using SPSS ( Version 18 . 0 for Window , SPSS , Chicago , IL ) and data was expressed as means ± S . D . Statistical signi ﬁ cance was determined using Student ' s t - test or ANOVA . A value of P < 0 . 05 was considered statistically signi ﬁ cant . 3 . Results 3 . 1 . LPS stimulated the up - regulation and membrane translocation of EFhd2 in macrophage The expression of EFhd2 was con ﬁ rmed both in peritoneal macro - phages and the RAW264 . 7 cells using Western blot assay ( Fig . 1A ) . A signi ﬁ cant up - regulation of EFhd2 was observed in peritoneal macro - phages when challenged with 1 μ g / ml LPS for 12 h in vitro ( Fig . 1B ) . Ex vivo , peritoneal macrophages isolated from LPS - induced septic mice also exhibited higher expression of EFhd2 than that in control macro - phages ( Fig . 1C ) . EFhd2 was also observed to be localized both in the cytomembrane and cytoplasm by immuno ﬂ uorescence analysis ( Fig . 1D ) . Interestingly , we found that the distribution of EFhd2 varied distinctly under LPS stimulation ( Fig . 1D ) . By comparing the expression of EFhd2 in the cytomembrane and cytoplasm separately , it was de - monstrated that LPS stimulated the translocation of EFhd2 to the membrane in macrophages ( Fig . 1E ) . 3 . 2 . EFhd2 de ﬁ ciency attenuated LPS - induced macrophage recruitment in the lungs In LPS - induced septic mice , macrophage in ﬁ ltration and aggrega - tion in the lung is an early event [ 29 ] . Liposome encapsulation of bi - sphosphonate clodronate is known to cause the transient depletion of macrophages [ 30 ] . F4 / 80 - positive macrophage recruitment was sig - ni ﬁ cantly attenuated in the lung of LPS - induced septic mice pretreated with i . v . injection of clodronate liposomes ( CLOP , 0 . 1 ml / 10 g ) ( Fig . 2A , B ) . Although supplementation of macrophages isolated from WT mice partially restored macrophage recruitment in the lung , the e ﬀ ect of macrophages from KO mice was unremarkable ( Fig . 2A , B ) . This phenomenon was also con ﬁ rmed by ﬂ ow cytometry analysis of F4 / 80 + CD11b + macrophages in BALF ( Fig . 2C ) . Interestingly , the numbers of total cells ( WT , 3 . 5 ± 0 . 14 × 10 7 vs . KO , 1 . 9 ± 0 . 45 × 10 7 , P < 0 . 05 ) and F4 / 80 - positive macrophages ( WT , 2 . 1 ± 0 . 14 × 10 7 vs . KO , 0 . 7 ± 0 . 09 × 10 7 , P < 0 . 0001 ) were also signi ﬁ cantly reduced in the peritoneal cavity isolated from KO mice . 3 . 3 . EFhd2 - mediated macrophage migration was dependent on F - actin polymerization Recent studies have shown that EFhd2 is involved in the regulation of cell motility [ 19 , 31 ] . It has been reported that macrophage migration is signi ﬁ cantly enhanced under the challenge of LPS [ 12 , 17 – 19 , 32 – 35 ] . In the current study , we con ﬁ rmed that LPS markedly increased peri - toneal macrophage migration using a Transwell assay in vitro . How - ever , this phenomenon was not observed in macrophages isolated from KO mice after LPS stimulation ( Fig . 3A ) . Ex vivo , peritoneal macro - phages isolated from LPS - induced septic mice also exhibited depressed migration in the absence of EFhd2 ( Fig . 3B ) . LPS - stimulated macro - phage migration was neutralized by cytochalasin D or latrunculin A ( F - actin depolymerization agents ) ( Fig . 3C ) . Furthermore , we found that over - expression of EFhd2 ( Fig . 3D ) alone could accelerate macrophage migration ( Fig . 3E ) . These data suggested that the participation of EFhd2 in macrophage migration was dependent on F - actin poly - merization . To gain insight into the mechanism by which EFhd2 con - tributes to macrophage migration , we measured EFhd2 ' s e ﬀ ect on the organization of the actin cytoskeleton . Stimulation of peritoneal mac - rophages with LPS induced considerable reorganization of actin , char - acterized by the appearance of typical mobile forms including polar - ization , elongation , membrane ru ﬄ es , lamellipodia and cell spreading ( Fig . 3F , G ) . In contrast , peritoneal macrophages isolated from KO mice maintained a rounded morphology and normal cell area enlargement under LPS stimulation ( Fig . 3F , G ) . 3 . 4 . EFhd2 interacted with F - actin and promoted actin polymerization in macrophages Several reports have demonstrated the co - localization of EFhd2 with F - actin in mast cells , T cells and B cells [ 19 , 20 ] . To describe the re - lationship between EFhd2 and F - actin in macrophage , we observed the distribution of EFhd2 and F - actin in the RAW264 . 7 cells with or without LPS stimulation . It was found that EFhd2 co - located with F - actin and the stimulation of LPS could enhance the co - located expres - sion at the front edge of macrophages ( Fig . 4A ) . Interestingly , over - expression of EFhd2 alone also increased the co - located expression of EFhd2 and F - actin even without LPS stimulation ( Fig . 4A ) , which in - dicated that EFhd2 might mediate the polymerization of F - actin to participate in macrophage migration under LPS stimulation . Next , we found that LPS increased the F - actin / G - actin ratio in macrophages , whereas this e ﬀ ect was abolished in the absence of EFhd2 ( Fig . 4B ) . EFhd2 interacted with actin under normal conditions , and this inter - action was more closely associated with the stimulation of LPS ( Fig . 4C ) . This result coincided with the co - location of EFhd2 and F - actin described above . Furthermore , we used an F - actin polymerization assay to observe the possible pre - polymerization e ﬀ ect of EFhd2 in vitro . The result showed that the e ﬀ ect of EFhd2 ( 100 nM ) on actin polymerization was comparable to that of Arp2 / 3 and WASP ( Fig . 4D ) . The e ﬀ ect of EFhd2 on the promotion of actin polymerization is dose - dependent ( Fig . 4D ) . 3 . 5 . EFhd2 de ﬁ ciency neutralized LPS stimulated up - regulation of NPFs According to the data obtained from STRING Protein - Protein Interaction Networks , ﬁ ve proteins of the top ten predicted functional partners associated with EFhd2 are Arp 2 / 3 complex subunits : ARPC2 , ARPC3 , ARPC4 , ARPC5 and ACTR2 ( Arp2 homolog ( yeast ) ) . These subunits function as actin - binding components of the Arp2 / 3 complex which is involved in the regulation of actin polymerization , and med - iate the formation of branched actin networks together with activating NPFs . Therefore , the results provide strong evidence for the correlation of EFhd2 and Arp2 / 3 complex . Here , we ﬁ rst detected the expression of Rac1 / Cdc42 , phospho - Rac1 / Cdc42 ( Ser71 ) , N - WASP , WAVE - 2 , Arp2 , Arp3 and Pro ﬁ lin - 1 using an Actin Nucleation and Polymerization Antibody Sampler Kit . LPS could up - regulate Rac1 / Cdc42 , phospho - Rac1 / Cdc42 , N - WASP , WAVE - 2 and Arp3 signi ﬁ cantly , whereas the absence of EFhd2 neutralized these changes ( Fig . 5A ) . However , Arp2 was up - regulated by LPS regardless of the absence of EFhd2 ( Fig . 5A ) . Pro ﬁ lin - 1 did not respond to LPS stimulation ( Fig . 5A ) . In addition , we observed that the up - regulation of ARPC5 induced by LPS could also be mediated by EFhd2 ( Fig . 5B ) . Deletion of EFhd2 did not a ﬀ ect the ex - pression of ARPC2 and ARPC4 increased under LPS incubation ( Fig . 5B ) . Because RhoGTPase ROCK has been proven to play an im - portant role in the reorganization of actin in macrophages , we then investigated whether EFhd2 participated in the activation of ROCK - MLC signal . Although the deletion of EFhd2 had little e ﬀ ect on the expression of ROCK - 1 , the expression levels of MLC , phospho - MLC ( Ser19 ) and phospho - MLC ( Thr18 ) were signi ﬁ cantly decreased in Y . Tu et al . International Immunopharmacology 55 ( 2018 ) 263 – 271 266 macrophages isolated from KO mice compared with the levels measured in WT macrophages ( Fig . 5C ) . 3 . 6 . Src inhibitor neutralized LPS - stimulated up - regulation of EFhd2 LPS - triggered macrophage migration is dependent on the activation of the NF - κ B / iNOS / c - Src pathway [ 45 ] . In resting macrophages , the expression of iNOS or c - Src was nearly absent . However , the expression of iNOS or c - Src was increased signi ﬁ cantly after LPS stimulation for 12 h . PP2 , an Src - family tyrosine kinase inhibitor , slightly inhibited LPS induced up - regulation of EFhd2 ( Fig . 6A ) . Furthermore , dasatinib , a c - Src - speci ﬁ c inhibitor , signi ﬁ cantly inhibited the expression of EFhd2 stimulated by LPS , which demonstrated that EFhd2 might serve as a downstream target of c - Src in regulating macrophage migration in - duced by LPS ( Fig . 6B ) . Moreover , LPS stimulated tyrosine phosphor - ylation of EFhd2 in RAW264 . 7 cells ( Fig . 6C ) . 4 . Discussion Upon Gram - negative bacterial infection , in addition to chemokines and adhesion molecules mediating the transendothelial migration of monocytes [ 36 , 37 ] , LPS itself can also directly induce rapid elongation , ru ﬄ ing and movement of macrophages [ 10 , 17 , 18 , 34 , 38 , 39 ] . In dif - ferent cells , the role of LPS in promoting cell migration depends on its stimulating concentration . Exposure of cardiac stem cells to a high LPS ( 1 μ g / ml ) inhibited cell migration , whereas 0 . 01 or 0 . 1 μ g / ml LPS sig - ni ﬁ cantly increased the number of migrated cells [ 40 ] . In human dental pulp stem cells , LPS increased migration of cells at a concentration of 1 μ g / ml while decreasing it signi ﬁ cantly at 10 μ g / ml [ 41 ] . In vitro , it has been reported that LPS at 25 – 200 ng / ml induces a signi ﬁ cant in - crease in RAW264 . 7 cell migration in a concentration - dependent manner [ 10 , 32 ] . In human serum , an equivalent amount of LPS ( ran - ging from 0 . 05 to 2 . 08 μ g / ml ) can create life - threatening septic shock [ 42 , 43 ] . Here , we used LPS at a concentration of 1 μ g / ml to stimulate monocytes / macrophages extracted from the abdominal cavity of mice , and found signi ﬁ cant increases in cell spreading , actin polymerization Fig . 2 .

Thus , the concentration of LPS we selected was also appropriate for observing the migration of macrophages in vitro . LPS - mediated macrophage migration requires the enhancement of c - Src expression and enzymatic activity [ 17 , 18 , 34 ] . The barely detect - able c - Src exhibits a remarkable LPS - inducible behavior and is activated by nitric oxide generated by iNOS in response to TLR engagement , leading to focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) activation and migration of macrophages [ 44 , 45 ] . However , the molecular mechanism involved in the promotion of macrophage migration after c - Src induction is unclear . Although it has already been reported that EFhd2 can regulate cell motility in several cells [ 19 , 21 , 31 , 46 , 47 ] , in this study we con ﬁ rmed that EFhd2 was involved in LPS - stimulated macrophage migration by promoting actin polymerization directly . In addition , we observed that the up - regulation of EFhd2 induced by LPS was dependent on the ac - tivation of c - Src and that LPS could also induce tyrosine phosphoryla - tion of EFhd2 in RAW264 . 7 cells . EFhd2 contains two tyrosine residues , tyr83 and tyr104 . However , substitution of the residues con ﬁ rmed that tyrosine phosphorylation was irrelevant to actin remodeling [ 21 ] . Si - multaneously , with actin polymerization , LPS - stimulated phosphoryla - tion of N - WASP on serine 484 / 485 was inhibited by Src inhibitor PP2 [ 10 ] . Here , we additionally observed that the absence of EFhd2 abolished LPS - induced up - regulation of N - WASP . Therefore , EFhd2 may serve as a downstream target of c - Src in mediating LPS - induced migration of macrophages by activating NPFs , including N - WASP and WAVE . However , the process of c - Src - dependent expression of EFhd2 remains to be studied . EFhd2 exhibits the microvilli - like protrusive structures and la - mellipodia of mast cells at high concentration , and highly co - localizes with F - actin , which indicates a possible role of EFhd2 in actin re - modeling [ 19 ] . In this study , EFhd2 - over - expressed RAW264 . 7 cells exhibited augmented migration . However , these changes could be eliminated by F - actin depolymerizing agent , demonstrating that EFhd2 - associated migration relies on remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton . The lamellipodium is the thin , sheet - like , leading edge of moving cells [ 48 ] . Accordingly , it has been reported that over - expression of EFhd2 in - creases the activity of Rac1 , which regulates the formation of mem - brane ru ﬄ es and lamellipodia [ 19 ] . In our study , LPS - induced ﬁ lipo - dium formation was also abolished in EFhd2 − / − macrophages ( data not shown ) . In view of the identi ﬁ cation of EFhd2 as a novel actin bundling protein [ 19 ] , it is easy to understand why EFhd2 can a ﬀ ect the for - mation of ﬁ lopodia , because ﬁ lopodia are generated by bundling of actin ﬁ laments [ 49 ] . Furthermore , Cdc42 activation also induces the Fig . 3 . EFhd2 mediated LPS - induced macrophage migra - tion was dependent on F - actin polymerization .

Kwon et al . used high - speed actin co - sedimentation assay to analyze the interaction between EFhd2 and F - actin . Co - sedimentation with puri ﬁ ed non - muscle actin and His - tagged EFhd2 revealed that EFhd2 could be bound to F - actin [ 19 ] . Here , we used coimmunoprecipitation to analyze the potential interaction between EFhd2 and actin in lysates of peritoneal macrophages . Immunoblotting showed that the antibody of EFhd2 was able to pull down actin , and the interaction of EFhd2 and actin was enhanced after LPS stimulation . In addition , we found that the absence of EFhd2 neutralized the increased ratio of F - actin / G - actin induced by LPS . More importantly , it was shown that EFhd2 dose - de - pendently promoted actin polymerization in vitro . To summarize , LPS stimulated EFhd2 up - regulation and increased the interaction between EFhd2 and actin , and ultimately promoted actin polymerization . The Arp2 / 3 complex consists of actin - related proteins Arp2 , Arp3 and ﬁ ve unrelated subunits named ARPC1 , ARPC2 , ARPC3 , ARPC4 and ARPC5 [ 51 ] . Based on the possibility that Arp 2 / 3 complex may interact with EFhd2 , we investigated the e ﬀ ect of EFhd2 on the ex - pression of Arp2 , Arp3 , ARPC2 , ARPC4 and ARPC5 in macrophages after LPS stimulation . Interestingly , deletion of EFhd2 only a ﬀ ected the up - regulation of Arp3 and ARPC5 induced by LPS , while the expression of Arp2 , ARPC2 and ARPC4 was not disturbed . EFhd2 - mediated up - regulation of NPFs ( including Rac1 / Cdc42 and N - WASP / WAVE2 ) in - duced by LPS can be used to explain the regulation of Arp2 / 3 complex , but why EFhd2 selectively regulates the expression of Arp2 / 3 complex remains to be studied . In conclusion , we proved that EFhd2 is involved in the LPS - stimu - lated migration of macrophages . EFhd2 regulated LPS - induced up - reg - ulation of NPFs and selectively mediated the expression of Arp3 and ARPC5 , which might result in actin polymerization . EFhd2 appeared to be a possible downstream target of c - Src in macrophage motility . Con ﬂ ict of interest The authors have declared that no competing interests exist . Fig . 4 .
