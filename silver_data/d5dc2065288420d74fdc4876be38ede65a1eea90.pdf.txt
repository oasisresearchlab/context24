Previous studies reported substantial heterogeneity in transmission of many infectious diseases ( including SARS - CoV - 2 ) . However , those results are difficult to interpret since the number of contacts is rarely considered in such approaches . Here , we analyze data from 17 SARS - CoV - 2 household transmission studies conducted in periods dominated by ancestral strains , in which the number of contacts was known . By fitting individual - based household transmission models to these data , accounting for number of contacts and baseline transmission probabilities , the pooled estimate suggests that the 20 % most infectious cases have 3 . 1 - fold ( 95 % confidence interval : 2 . 2 - 4 . 2 fold ) higher infectiousness than average cases , which is consistent with the observed heterogeneity in viral shedding . Household data can inform the estimation of transmission heterogeneity , which is important for epidemic management . One Sentence Summary : In this study , variation of individual infectiousness is quantified . Potential sources of such variation , particularly heterogeneity of viral shedding is discussed . .

The reproductive number is the widely adopted measure of infectiousness . However , it only measures the average number of secondary cases infected by an infected person , not the heterogeneity in the number of transmissions . Variation of individual infectiousness is particularly highlighted by superspreading events ( SSEs ) , in which a minority of cases are responsible for a majority of transmission events . Such phenomena , illustrated by the ‚Äú80 / 20 rule‚Äù ( i . e . , 20 % of cases responsible for 80 % transmission ( 1 , 2 ) ) , have been observed in emerging infectious disease outbreaks ( 3 ) , including severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) ( 4 ) , middle east respiratory syndrome ( MERS ) ( 5 , 6 ) and most recently the COVID - 19 pandemic ( 1 , 2 , 7 - 9 ) . In these outbreaks , the proportion of cases attributed to 80 % transmission ( p 80 ) , and the dispersion parameter ( k ) were estimated by fitting the negative binomial distribution to the number of secondary cases ( 3 ) as a measure of transmission heterogeneity . However , the number of contacts per index cases is often not reported in SSE studies , and hence not incorporated in the analyses . In addition , SSE studies usually analyze clusters from different settings , in which the baseline transmission risk and density of exposure could be different ( 10 ) . Finally , studies of transmission heterogeneity that focus on SSEs described in the literature may suffer from publication bias , with larger clusters having higher probability of being observed and reported ( 8 ) . Therefore , the observed heterogeneity in the number of secondary cases could be a result of large number of contacts in SSE settings , or confounding from these factors ( 11 , 12 ) , instead of variation in individual infectiousness . .

Hence , household transmission studies provide an ideal setting to quantify variations in individual infectiousness . In a household transmission study , an index case is identified , and their household contacts are followed - up for one to two weeks , during which there is high transmission potential ( 13 ) . Therefore , the number of contacts is known while transmission risks and reporting biases can be controlled . We aim to characterize the variation of individual infectiousness by analyzing data from household transmission studies . RESULTS Estimating the variation of individual infectiousness from household studies We conducted a systematic review to gather information on the number of secondary cases with the number of household contacts for each household , in the form of number of households with X cases among households of size Y . In total , we identified 17 studies , comprising 13098 index cases and 31359 household contacts ( Fig . S1 , Table S1 ) ( 14 - 30 ) . Most studies covered the cases from January to November 2020 , which was dominated by ancestral strains , except for Layan et al . ( from December 2020 to April 2021 ) and Hsu et al . ( from January 2020 to February 2021 ) , which covered both ancestral strains and the alpha variant . We then developed a statistical model to quantify the degree and the impact of variation of infectiousness of cases on transmission dynamics . The individual - based household transmission model describes the probability of infection of household contacts as depending on the time since infection in other infected persons in the household , so that infections from outside the .

We extend this model by adding a random effect ( ùõø ! ) on the individual infectiousness of cases . Here , the relative infectiousness of case i compared with case j is exp ( ùõø ! ) / exp ( ùõø " ) . The parameter for variation in individual infectiousness ( hereafter denoted as infectiousness variation , ùúé # $ % ) is the standard deviation ( SD ) of the random effect characterizing individual infectiousness , so that ùõø ! follows Normal distribution with mean equal to 0 and SD equal to ùúé # $ % . We separately fit the models to 14 studies with more than 150 contacts ( 14 - 27 ) ( Fig . 1 , Table S2 ) . For 12 studies out of 14 , models with infectiousness variation perform substantially better ( range of ‚àÜDIC : 5 . 8 - 268 ) ( Figure 2 , Table S2 ) . From these 12 studies , the estimated infectiousness variation ( ùúé # $ % ) ranged from 1 . 03 to 2 . 83 . This suggests that , the 20 % most infectious cases are 2 . 4 - fold to 10 - fold more infectious than the average case . Based on the two largest studies with 6782 and 3727 households ( 14 , 15 ) , the estimated infectiousness variation is 1 . 48 ( 95 % credible interval ( CrI ) : 1 . 29 , 1 . 7 ) and 1 . 41 ( 95 % CrI : 1 . 19 , 1 . 72 ) , suggesting that , among all cases , the 20 % most infectious are 3 . 5 - fold ( 95 % CrI : 3 . 0 - 4 . 2 fold ) and 3 . 3 - fold ( 95 % CrI : 2 . 7 - 4 . 3 fold ) more infectious than the average case . The estimated daily probability of infection from outside the household and estimated person - to - person transmission probability within households are ranged from 0 . 0003 to 0 . 017 , and from 0 . 06 to 0 . 51 respectively . The estimates of parameters for the relationship between number of contacts and transmission ( larger value indicates stronger inverse association ) are ranged from 0 . 43 to 0 . 92 , except for the study by Layan et al ( 18 ) where it is equal to 0 . 2 . For all studies , the predicted final size distribution is consistent with the observed data and the model fit is judged adequate ( Table S3 - S4 ) . .

The pooled estimate of infectiousness variation is 1 . 33 ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) : 0 . 95 , 1 . 70 ) , suggesting that the 20 % most infectious cases are 3 . 1 - fold ( 95 % CI : 2 . 2 - 4 . 2 fold ) more infectious than the average case ( Figure 4 ) . Based on this fitted distribution , we estimate that 5 . 9 % ( 95 % CI : 1 . 4 % , 11 . 1 % ) and 14 . 9 % ( 95 % CI : 7 . 2 % , 20 . 7 % ) of cases could be at least 8 - fold and 4 - fold more infectious than average cases , respectively . Proxy measures of infectiousness variation While such a modeling approach generates valuable information on infectiousness variation from household studies , directly applying this approach may be challenging due to the complexity in modelling and estimation . There is therefore a need to determine the relationship between characteristic of household transmissions and infectiousness variation , to design and validate a proxy of infectiousness variation , such as the widely used p 80 . We consider the following candidate : 1 ) p 80 , defined as the proportion of index cases that had > 80 % of their household contacts becoming cases in the study , 2 ) the proportion of households in which no contacts are infected ( p 0 ) , 3 ) the secondary attack rate ( SAR , the proportion of infected contacts ) , and 4 ) the standard deviation ( SD ) of the distribution of number of secondary cases ( ùúé & ‚Äô ( ) ( Fig . 2 ; Table S5 ) . In meta - regression , we find the infectiousness variation is associated with ùëù ) * , ùëù * and SAR . We estimate that doubling ùëù ) * and SAR are associated with 0 . 70 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 30 , 1 . 09 ) and 0 . 55 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 21 , 0 . 89 ) unit decrease in infectiousness variation , with R - squared equal to 76 % and 68 % .

We also estimate that doubling ùëù * is associated with 0 . 85 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 33 , 1 . 38 ) unit increase in infectious variation ( R 2 = 75 % ) . In addition , we find that higher infectiousness variation is associated with only using PCR to ascertain secondary cases . Regarding other statistics , we find that ùúé & ‚Äô ( is positively associated with mean and SD of number of contacts . Regarding other factors , we find that higher infectiousness variation is associated with only using PCR to confirm secondary cases . Other than these associations , we find no association between these statistics and implementation of lockdown , ascertainment method of index and secondary cases , and the circulating virus of SARS - CoV - 2 in the study period . DISCUSSION In this study , we characterize the impact of variation of individual infectiousness on heterogeneity of transmission of COVID - 19 in households . We demonstrate that it can be estimated from household data using a modeling approach . The pooled estimate of infectiousness variation from 14 studies suggests that the 20 % most infectious cases have 3 . 1 - fold ( 95 % CI : 2 . 2 - 4 . 2 - fold ) higher infectiousness compared with average index cases . This implies there is substantial variation in individual infectiousness of cases in households . This variation could be attributed to both biological factors and host behaviours . Regarding host behaviours , multiple contact patterns , particularly by age , could contribute to the variations in infectiousness of cases . For example , mother - child contacts are usually more intense than father - child contacts , and adult cases are more capable of self - isolation within a household compared with children . Furthermore , contact pattern studies suggested that school - age children and young adults tended to mix with people of the same age ( 34 , 35 ) . .

For example , the SAR for index cases with fever and cough are 1 . 4 - fold and 1 . 3 - fold higher than index cases without fever and cough respectively ( 36 ) . Viral shedding is used as a proxy measure of infectiousness , and consistently it also has substantial variations ( 37 ) . Regarding the magnitude of viral shedding , studies report high variations of temporal viral shedding patterns among individuals ( 38 - 40 ) . In addition , the duration of viral shedding can be highly heterogeneous , with pooled estimates of mean durations ranging from 11 . 1 days to 30 . 3 days , and almost all reviews report high heterogeneity of estimates identified from literatures ( 37 , 41 - 50 ) . Such heterogeneities still exist in subgroup analyses by age and severity ( 37 , 41 - 45 , 50 ) . Also , the infectious period , proxied by duration of replicant competent virus isolation , is also heterogeneous ( 50 ) . One review also suggest that heterogeneity in viral shedding is an intrinsic virological factor facilitating higher dispersion parameter for SARS - CoV - 2 if we compare it with the corresponding patterns in SARS - CoV - 1 and pandemic influenza A ( H1N1 ) pdm09 ( 51 ) . The observed variation in individual infectiousness is consistent with past analyses of the dispersion parameter in a negative binomial distribution fitted to number of secondary cases per index case of COVID - 19 ( 2 , 52 ) . However , in these studies , the number of contacts are not considered . Therefore , the observed variations may not apply directly to households with limited number of contacts . Here , we explore the relationship between infectiousness variations and household characteristics , and the commonly adopted measure of heterogeneity , proportion of cases attributed to 80 % transmission ( p 80 ) . We find that infectiousness variation is strongly .

Infectiousness variation is also correlated with the secondary attack rate ( SAR ) , and the proportion of households in which no contacts are infected ( p 0 ) . When secondary attack rate is higher , it is expected that more contacts are infected and therefore the observed number of secondary cases would be less heterogeneous . The strong association between p 0 and infectiousness variation suggests that the observed variations may also be attributed to some cases that are less infectious than average , which is consistent with Hong Kong data ( 53 ) . In contrast , the SD of the distribution of number of secondary cases ( ùúé & ‚Äô ( ) is only weakly correlated with infectiousness variation . This is because ùúé & ‚Äô ( is highly correlated with the mean and SD of number of contacts , suggesting that it may depend on distribution of number of contacts , and hence may not be comparable among studies . We find higher infectiousness variation is associated with only using PCR to confirm secondary cases . One potential reason is that using other methods may lower the sensitivity of detecting infection , resulting in lower estimates of SAR and hence higher estimates of infectiousness variation . Further investigations are needed to explore roles of other potential factors affecting infectiousness variation , such as contact frequency among different regions ( 35 ) . An important limitation of our study is that we do not have individual - level data . Therefore , we are unable to determine the impact of demographic factors like age and sex on infectiousness variation . Also , we cannot disentangle the host behaviors from biological factors . Previous analysis suggested no evidence of the impact of age on infectiousness of cases ( 2 , 9 ) . In addition , .

Our estimates of infectiousness variation should be interpreted in light of these limitations : they capture heterogeneity in infectiousness due to demographic , host and biological factors . If we were able to account for these factors thanks to the analysis of more detailed datasets , our estimates of infectiousness variations would likely be lower . However , in one study that included susceptibility component in the estimation of individual infectiousness , substantial heterogeneity remained with 20 % of cases estimated to contribute to 80 % of transmission ( 22 ) . Second , the recruitment methods among studies are different . This may affect the comparability of the results , although all index cases are laboratory - confirmed in all studies ( 32 ) . Finally , most of our identified studies were conducted in the period of circulation of ancestral strains , and therefore the identified infectiousness variation may not be directly applicable to other variants . In conclusion , we developed a modeling approach to estimate variation in individual infectiousness from household data . Result indicates that there is substantial variation in individual infectiousness , which is important for epidemic management . MATERIALS AND METHODS Study design The aim of this study was to develop a statistical model to quantify the variation of individual infectiousness in households , based on publicly available information . An index case was defined as the first detected case in a household , while secondary cases were defined as the identified infected household contacts of the index case . We conducted a systematic review to collect household studies with at least 30 households , reporting the number of secondary cases .

For each study , we also extracted the study period , the coverage of tests of household contacts , the case ascertainment methods , the circulating virus of SARS - CoV - 2 , and the public health and social measures in the study period . This information was used as an input of modeling analyses in this study . Details of systematic review could be found in Materials and Methods Section 1 . Estimation of variation of individual infectiousness in households To determine if there are variations of individual infectiousness of cases , we use an individual - based household transmission model ( 31 - 33 ) . The model describes the probability of infection of household contacts as depending on the time since infection in other infected people in the household , while infections from outside the household ( community infections ) , or infections via other household contacts rather than the index case ( tertiary infections ) are allowed . We extend the model by adding a random effect parameter ( ùõø ! ) on the individual infectiousness of each case . Here , ùõø ! follows a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation ùúé # $ % , which quantify the variation of individual infectiousness ( hereafter denoted as infectiousness variation ) . The relative infectiousness of case i compared with case j is exp ( ùõø ! ) / exp ( ùõø " ) . Since the data were extracted from publication , the infection time of cases was unavailable . Also , the individual infectiousness parameters ùõø ! for cases were augmented variables . Therefore , we conducted our inference under a Bayesian framework with using data - augmentation Markov chain Monte Carlo ( MCMC ) algorithm to joint estimate the model parameters , the missing infection time and augmented variables with using metropolis - hasting algorithm .

We assessed the model adequacy by comparing the observed and expected number of infections in households by household size . We compared the model with or without the random effect for variation of individual infectiousness by using Deviance Information Criterion ( DIC ) ( 54 ) . Smaller DIC indicated a better model fit . DIC difference > 5 was considered as substantial improvement ( 55 ) . Details of the model and inference could be found in Materials and Methods Section 2 and 3 . Statistical analysis We conducted random effects meta - analyses on identified studies to obtain pooled estimates of individual infectiousness and p 80 , using the inverse variance method and restricted maximum likelihood estimator for heterogeneity ( 56 - 59 ) . Cochran Q test and the I 2 statistic were used to identify and quantify heterogeneity among included studies ( 60 , 61 ) . An I 2 value more than 75 % indicates high heterogeneity ( 61 ) . We conducted a meta regression analysis to explore the association between these statistics , and further including the following factors : the mean and SD of number of household contacts , implementation of lockdown , ascertainment method of index and secondary cases , only ancestral strains are circulating in study period , and all household contacts were tested .

A standardized search was done in PubMed , Embase and Web of Science , using the search term ‚Äú ( " COVID - 19 " OR " SARS - CoV - 2 " ) AND ( " household " OR " family " ) AND ( " transmission " ) ‚Äù . The search was done on 22 June , 2022 , with no language restrictions . Additional relevant articles from the reference sections were also reviewed . Two authors ( XH and CW ) independently screened the titles and extracted data from the included studies , with disagreement resolved by consensus together with a third author ( TKT ) . Studies identified from different databases were de - duplicated . 2 Household transmission model Our aim was to explore the role of variation of individual infectiousness on transmission , with accounting for the variation and number of contacts , and the transmission probability . Therefore , we extended the household transmission model to account for variation of individual infectiousness of index cases ( 31 ) . We added a random effect on infectiousness of cases ( 33 ) . In the model , the hazard of infection of individual j at time t from an infected household member i , with infection time t i in household k , was ùúÜ ! ‚Üí " ( ùë° ) = ùúÜ , ùëã - . ‚àó exp ( ùõø ! ) ‚àó ùëì ( ùë° ‚àí ùë° ! ) where ùúÜ , was the baseline hazard , ùõø ! was the relative individual infectiousness of cases , which followed a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation ùúé # $ % . ùëã - was the number of household contacts . ùõΩ was the parameter describing the relationship between number of household contacts and transmission rate . It ranged from 0 to 1 , with 0 indicating that the transmission rate is independent of number of household contacts while 1 indicates that the transmission rate is inversely proportional to number of household contacts ( i . e . dilution effect of the contact time per contact which is lower when the number of household contacts is higher ) . f ( . ) was .

The daily hazard of infection from outside the household is assumed to be ùúÜ ( ( ùë° ) = ùúÜ ( . Hence , the total hazard infection of individual j on day t was ùúÜ " ( ùë° ) = ùúÜ ( + 3 ùúÜ ! ‚Üí " ( ùë° ) ! : ! 01‚Äô ( 2‚Äô3 Based on the transmission model , the probability that an individual i was infected with infection time ùë° ! * was ùëÉ ( ùë¶ ! = 1 , ùë° ! = ùë° ! * ) = [ 1 ‚àí exp9‚àíùúÜ !

Denote the total follow - up time for an individual i as ùëß ! 8 , then the probability that an individual i did not get infected within the follow - up period is ùëÉ ( ùë¶ ! = 0 , ùë° ! = ùë° ! * = ùëß ! 8 + 1 ) = ùëíùë•ùëù > ‚àí 3 ùúÜ !

Index cases did not contribute to the likelihood and hence the summation was only on household contacts . 3 Inference , model comparison and validation The infection time for cases were unavailable in the data extracted from publication . Also , the individual infectiousness parameter ùõø ! was an augmented variable . Therefore , we conducted our inference under a Bayesian framework with using data - augmentation Markov chain Monte Carlo ( MCMC ) algorithm to joint estimate the model parameters , the missing infection time and the relative individual .

For the parameter that only takes positive value , we used a vague Uniform ( 0 , 10 ) prior . For the parameter for relationship between number of household contacts and transmission , we used Uniform ( 0 , 1 ) . The algorithm runs for 50000 iterations after a burn - in of 50000 iterations . Converge was visually assessed . One run takes about 3 hours on our typical desktop computer . We fitted the model to all studies , but only 14 of them could converge and provide robust estimates of individual infectiousness . We assessed the model adequacy by comparing the observed and expected number of infections in households by household size . We simulated 10000 datasets with a structure identical to that of the observed data ( in terms of number of household contacts ) , with parameters randomly drawn from the posterior distribution of model parameter . We compared the model with or without the random effect for variation of individual infectiousness by using Deviance Information Criterion ( DIC ) ( 54 ) . Smaller DIC indicated a better model fit . DIC difference > 5 was considered as substantial improvement ( 55 ) . Since the likelihood of observed data could not be directly evaluated for a given model ( 65 ) , we used an importance sampling approach to estimate the likelihood for the observed data and evaluate the DIC ( 66 , 67 ) . For each household , we simulated 2000 datasets , with parameters randomly drawn from the posterior distribution . Then we compared the observed data and simulated data . The contribution to the likelihood of a household was equal to the proportion of simulated data with infection status that exactly matched the observed data , for all household members . To avoid the problem of 0 - valued likelihood , we used the approach developed by Cauchemez et al ( 66 ) , and assumed the sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing a case were both 99 . 99 % . 4 Data and code availability The data and computer code ( in R languages ) for conducting the data analysis can be downloaded from https : / / github . com / timktsang / covid19 _ transmission _ heterogeneity .
