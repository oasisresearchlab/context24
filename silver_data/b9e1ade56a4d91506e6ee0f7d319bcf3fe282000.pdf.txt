Virus entry is the process by which the incoming viral particle gains access to the host cell . Investigation of viral entry reveals novel targets for interfering with the virus before it can commandeer the host cell machinery for replication . Viruses use virally encoded and cellular factors to overcome multiple obstacles for successful entry , allowing for the delivery of the viral genome to the preferred subcellular site of viral replication . Virus - receptor interactions can play multiple roles in viral entry , including cell attachment , endocytosis , membrane fusion , and molecular signaling . Endocytosis is a fundamental cellular activity that is utilized by the majority of animal virus families to introduce their genetic material to the cell interior . The different pathways subjugated by viruses include clathrin - mediated endocytosis , caveolae , macropinocytosis , and nonclathrin , noncaveolae routes . Endocytic processes offer several advantages to the incoming virus , including transit through the cell periphery , which can contain a thick layer of cortical actin . The acidic environment of an endo - somal compartment is often needed to mediate penetration into the cytoplasm . This special issue on viral entry via endocytosis compiles five topical review articles on several diverse animal viruses . Two papers in this special issue review the entry of members of the nonenveloped picornavirus family . R . Fuchs and D . Blaas focus on the entry of types A , B , and C human rhinoviruses , a group of more than 100 distinct serotypes for which there are no vaccines . For nonenveloped viruses , delivery of genetic cargo to the cytoplasm can occur by pore formation or rupture of an endocytic membrane . Continuing on this theme , P . Merilahti et al . review the cellular entry pathways utilized by three additional human picornaviruses : coxsackievirus A9 , echovirus 9 , and parechovirus 1 . These viruses share the common ability to bind to host cell integrins during viral entry . Herpesviral entry is a complex interplay of multiple viral envelope proteins and multiple cellular factors . In the third paper , T . Maeki and Y . Mori present a review of the cell entry of two closely related betaherpesviruses , human herpesvirus - ( HHV - ) 6A and HHV - 6B . Interactions of both HHV - 6 species with the host cell receptor CD46 are considered . These viruses contain distinct glycoprotein complexes comprised of gH - gL and additional proteins . This is a characteristic shared by other human herpesviruses , such as human cytomegalovirus and Epstein - Barr virus . HHV - 6A and HHV - 6B both contain complexes of gH / gL / gO and gH / gL / gQ1 / gQ2 . In another paper , E . Rumschlag - Booms and L . Rong review the host cell entry of the global respiratory pathogen influenza A virus . Sialic acid moieties are critical for influenza pathogenesis , serving as binding receptors for entry and as determinants of tropism . Focus is on the genetics of influenza A viruses that contribute to entry tropism and on develop - ing anti - influenza entry therapeutics and their mechanism 2 Advances in Virology of action . Endocytosis is an important pathway for the entry of several retroviruses . In a paper of this special issue , Y . Kubo et al . review the role of endosomal acidification and cathepsin proteases in retroviral entry with an emphasis on murine leukemia viruses ( MLVs ) and human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) . Reports of the pH - dependent entry of CD4 - dependent and - independent HIVs are also discussed . Anthony V . Nicola Hector C . Aguilar Jason Mercer Brent Ryckman Christopher M . Wiethoff
