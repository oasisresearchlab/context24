Weisz 2 From the Laboratory of Epithelial Cell Biology , Renal - Electrolyte Division , University of Pittsburgh , Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania 15261 The mechanisms by which polarized epithelial cells target dis - tinctcarriersenrichedinnewlysynthesizedproteinstotheapicalor basolateral membrane remain largely unknown . Here we investi - gated the effect of phosphatidylinositol metabolism and modula - tion of the actin cytoskeleton , two regulatory mechanisms that have individually been suggested to function in biosynthetic traffic , on polarized traffic in Madin - Darby canine kidney cells . Overexpres - sion of phosphatidylinositol 5 - kinase ( PI5K ) increased actin comet frequency in Madin - Darby canine kidney cells and concomitantly stimulated trans - Golginetwork ( TGN ) toapicalmembranedelivery oftheraft - associatedproteininfluenzahemagglutinin ( HA ) , butdid not affect delivery of a non - raft - associated apical protein or a baso - lateral marker . Modulation of actin comet formation by pharmaco - logic means , by overexpression of the TGN - localized inositol poly - phosphate 5 - phosphatase Ocrl , or by blockade of Arp2 / 3 function had parallel effects on the rate of apical delivery of HA . Moreover , HA released from a TGN block was colocalized in transport carriers in association with PI5K and actin comets . Inhibition of Arp2 / 3 function in combination with microtubule depolymerization led to a virtual block in HA delivery , suggesting synergistic coordination ofthesecytoskeletalassembliesinmembranetransport . Ourresults suggest a previously unidentified role for actin comet - mediated propulsioninthebiosyntheticdeliveryofasubsetofapicalproteins . The maintenance of polarized cell function requires continuous active sorting and delivery of newly synthesized proteins and lipids to differentiated apical and basolateral plasma membrane domains . Tight junctions between the cells prevent the diffusion of surface proteins between these domains , but polarity is established and maintained largely by the selective delivery and recycling of proteins to their appro - priate site of function . In polarized renal cells , it is thought that newly synthesized proteins are sorted initially at the trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) 3 into distinct carriers destined for the apical or basolateral domain ( 1 , 2 ) . Transport of some proteins to their ultimate destination may be indirect and include passage through endosomal compartments or the opposite surface domain ( 2 ) . The sorting of individual proteins to the apical and basolateral cell surfacedomainsissignal - mediated . Basolateralsortingsignalsgenerally reside in the cytoplasmically disposed regions of proteins , whereas gly - can - , lipid - , and peptide - dependent signals have been identified that reside in the lumenal , membrane - associated , or cytoplasmic regions of distinct apically targeted proteins ( 2 ) . Little is known about how the sorting machinery recognizes these diverse signals ; however , a current model suggests that preferential incorporation of a subset of apical pro - teins , including those with glycosphingolipid anchors or sorting signals within their transmembrane domains , into glycolipid - enriched microdo - mains ( lipid rafts ) is important for their polarized delivery ( 1 ) . Interest - ingly , apical delivery of raft versus non - raft proteins may involve distinct transport carriers that are independently regulated ( 3 , 4 ) . There is increasing evidence for a role of phosphatidylinositols in the regulation of biosynthetic membrane traffic ( 5 ) . The Golgi contains a sizable pool of phosphatidylinositol 4 - phosphate ( PI4P ) and harbors two PI4P - synthesizing enzymes ( PI4KIII (cid:1) and PI4KII (cid:2) ( 6 – 9 ) ) . Our lab - oratory has previously demonstrated that overexpression of PI4KIII (cid:1) inhibits the rate of apical membrane delivery of the raft - associated pro - tein influenza hemagglutinin ( HA ) , whereas expression of a kinase - de - ficient mutant stimulates delivery ( 8 ) . However , it is conceivable that these effects are due to a downstream metabolite of PI4P , such as phos - phatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PIP 2 ) . Indeed , although there is only a small amount of this lipid that can be visualized in the Golgi complex ( 10 ) , PIP 2 is readily generated on isolated Golgi membranes incubated with phosphatidylinositol 4 - phosphate 5 - kinases ( PI5Ks ( 11 ) ) and sev - eral possible functions for PIP 2 in biosynthetic membrane traffic have been postulated ( 5 , 12 , 13 ) . Additionally , the presence of Ocrl , a TGN - localized PIP 2 5 (cid:1) - phosphatase that is defective or absent in patients with oculocerebrorenalsyndromeofLowe , lendsfurthersupporttoarolefor PIP 2 metabolism in that compartment ( 14 , 15 ) . Increases in PIP 2 levels upon expression of PI5Ks leads to production of rapidly nucleating branches of actin filaments , termed actin comets , which are capable of propelling transport vesicles through the cyto - plasm ( 16 ) . Neuronal Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein ( N - WASP ) , a potent stimulator of actin nucleation via the Arp2 / 3 complex , is acti - vated by PIP 2 and transduces elevated PIP 2 levels into an increased frequency of actin comets ( 17 ) . N - WASP and Arp2 / 3 are localized to the Golgi complex ( among other sites ) , and a link between actin comets and biosynthetic traffic has been previously suggested ( 18 ) . However , the effects of manipulating PI5K or Arp2 / 3 activity on the fidelity or rate of biosynthetic transport have not been explored . Here we have examined the effect of increasing PIP 2 synthesis on polarized biosynthetic traffic in Madin - Darby canine kidney ( MDCK ) cells . Expression of PI5K selectively stimulated the TGN to apical deliv - ery of a raft - associated protein without affecting the overall polarity of delivery . Moreover , the effect of PIP 2 appears to involve an Arp2 / 3 - de - pendent pathway , as a dominant - negative inhibitor of Arp2 / 3 function selectively inhibited biosynthetic transport of this protein . MDCK cells overexpressing PI5K had markedly increased numbers of actin comets , * ThisworkwassupportedinpartbyNationalInstitutesofHealthGrantsDK054407andDK064613andtheCommonwealthofPennsylvania ( to O .

Disruption of actin comet formation together with microtubule depolymerization led to a nearly total blockade in apical delivery , suggesting a concerted role ofthesedistinctcytoskeletalassembliesforefficientandpolarizedapical transport . Our data suggest that actin comets contribute selectively to the polarized delivery of apically destined transport containers enriched in lipid raft - associated cargo .

Constructs encoding myc - tagged W and WA domains of WAVE1 were generous gifts of Dr . Dorothy Schafer and Dr . James Casanova ( University of Virginia ) . Fluorescent protein - tagged actin constructs were provided by Dr . Ronald Montelaro ( University of Pittsburgh ) . The generation and purification of replication - defective recombinant adenoviruses ( AVs ) encoding tetracycline - repressible influenza HA ( Japan serotype ) , vesicular stomatitis virus G protein ( VSV - G ) , and a control virus ( encoding the influenza Rostock M2 coding sequence in the reverse orientation ) has been previously described ( 8 , 19 ) . AVs encoding PI5K , and human Ocrl ( both wild type and the phosphatase - deficient mutant R483G ; constructs pro - vided by Dr . Robert Nussbaum , National Institutes of Health ) were generated using similar methods . AV encoding p75 NTR was provided by Dr . Enrique Rodriguez - Boulan ( Weill Medical College ) with per - mission from Dr . Moses Chao , and AV - W and WA were kind gifts of Dr . James Casanova ( University of Virginia ) . Cell Lines and Adenoviral Infection —MDCK type II cells stably expressing tetracycline transactivator were cultured in modified Eagle’s medium ( Sigma ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum . For meas - urements of intra - Golgi transport , kinetics of surface delivery , and sur - face polarity , cells were seeded at superconfluence in 12 - mm transwells ( 0 . 4 - (cid:3) m pore ; Costar , Cambridge , MA ) for 2 – 4 days prior to infection with recombinant AVs at the following multiplicity of infection ( m . o . i . ) ( control AV , AV - PI5K , AV - W , and AV - WA , m . o . i . 100 – 250 ; AV - HA , AV - p75 , and AV - VSV - G , m . o . i . 25 – 50 ) as described in Ref . 19 . Experi - ments were performed the following day . Indirect Immunofluorescence —MDCK cells grown on transwell fil - ters or coverslips were infected with AVs at the indicated m . o . i . The following day , cells were rinsed once with PBS , fixed in 3 . 7 % formalde - hyde , rinsed with PBS containing 10 m M glycine ( PBS - G ) , then perme - abilized with 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 in PBS - G for 3 min at room temperature . After washing , nonspecific binding sites were blocked by incubation for 5 min in PBS - G containing 0 . 25 % ( w / v ) ovalbumin . Coverslips were incu - bated for 30 min with monoclonal anti - HA tag antibody ( 1 : 500 dilution ; Covance ) followed by washing in blocking buffer . Cells were then incu - batedfor30minwithsecondaryantibodiesAlexaFluorgoatanti - mouse 488 ( 1 : 500 ; Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) . Rhodamine phalloidin ( 1 : 80 ; Invitrogen ) was included in this step where indicated . After extensive washing , coverslips or filters were mounted onto slides . Filter - grown MDCK cells were fixed with formaldehyde using a pH - shift protocol and processed as described in Ref . 20 . Images were captured using a Leica TCS - SL confocal microscope equipped with argon and green and red helium neon lasers ( Leica , Dearfield , IL ) . Images were taken with a (cid:2) 100 ( 1 . 4 numerical aperture ) plan apochromat oil objective . TIFF images were processed using Adobe Photoshop ( Adobe , San Jose , CA ) . Intracellular Transport and Cell Surface Delivery Assays —AV - in - fected filter - grown MDCK cells were starved for 30 min and radiola - beled for 5 – 10 min ( endoglycosidase H ( endo H ) kinetics ) or 15 – 20 min ( TGN to surface delivery ) with 1 mCi / ml Tran - 35 S - label (cid:2) ( MP Bio - medicals , Irvine , CA ) . To measure endo H kinetics , cells were chased in bicarbonate - free modified Eagle’s medium for the indicated periods , solubilized , and HA immunoprecipitated as previously described in Ref . 19 . After collection of antibody - antigen complexes , samples were eluted , divided in half , and mock - treated or treated overnight with endo H prior to electrophoresis on 10 % SDS - PAGE gels . To measure TGN to surface delivery , radiolabeled cells were chased at 19 °C for 2 h unless otherwise indicated to stage newly synthesized membrane proteins in the TGN . The cells were then rapidly warmed to 32 or 37 °C as indi - cated . Apical delivery of HA was measured by trypsinization as described in Ref . 21 . Basolateral delivery of VSV - G was quantitated using domain selective biotinylation as described in Ref . 22 . To quanti - tatesurfacedeliveryofp75 NTR , cellswereradiolabeledon25 - (cid:3) ldropsof sulfate - free medium containing 100 (cid:3) Ci of [ 35 S ] sulfate at 18 °C and the rate of surface delivery was assessed using domain selective biotinyla - tion upon subsequent warmup to 37 °C ( 23 ) . Immunoprecipitation of HA , VSV - G , or p75 was performed using supernatants from cultured hybridomas ( Fc125 from Dr . Thomas Braciale , University of Vir - ginia ; 8G5 from Dr . Douglas Lyles , Wake Forest University ( 24 ) ; and MA 20 . 1 from Dr . Enrique Rodriguez - Boulan , Weill Medical Col - lege , respectively ) . Visualization and Quantitation of Actin Comets —MDCK cells ( 2 (cid:2) 10 5 ) were seeded on Bioptech 0 . 17 - mm (cid:3) T dishes ( Bioptech Inc . , Butler , PA ) . The following day cells were infected with AVs ( m . o . i . 100 – 250 ) encoding the indicated proteins , and incubated overnight with 0 . 25 ng / ml doxycycline ( DOX ) to partially suppress protein expression . The following morning DOX was removed by thorough washing . Cells were then pressure - injected with cDNA encoding GFP - or YFP - actin and were returned to culture for 5 h . Following that time the cells were imaged on an Olympus IX81 microscope using a (cid:2) 100 Olympus UPlanApo objective ( numerical aperture 1 . 35 ) . Random fields containing fluorescent actin - express - ing cells were imaged every 2 s for 4 min . Data were analyzed using acquisition software ( Slidebook ) to determine the percentage of cells with comets . Stable cells lines expressing fluorescent protein - tagged actin were generated using Lipofectamine 2000 and mixed popula - tions were isolated by selection in G418 . These cells were infected with AV - PI5K where indicated and used for the quantification of actin comets in cells treated with phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ; 5 (cid:3) g / ml ) , cytochalasin D ( 25 (cid:3) g / ml ) , 1 - butanol ( 1 % v / v ) , and t - butyl alcohol ( 1 % v / v ) . Visualization of Cargo Associated with Actin Comets —MDCK cells ( 3 (cid:2) 10 5 ) were seeded onto coverslips in 12 - well dishes . The following daythecellswereco - infectedwithAVsencodingHAandeitherPI5Kor control AV . After 8 h at 37 °C , the cells were incubated at 19 °C for 2 . 5 h to stage HA in the TGN . Dishes were then warmed to 37 °C for 0 or 30 min before fixation and processing for indirect immunofluorescence to detect HA , PI5K , and actin . RESULTS PI5K Selectively Stimulates Biosynthetic Delivery of an Apical Raft - associated Protein —We examined the effect of AV - mediated overexpression of murine PI5K (cid:2) on biosynthetic traffic in polarized MDCK cells . Overexpression of PI5K increased cellular levels of PIP 2 by 2 – 3 - fold ( not shown ) but did not alter intra - Golgi kinetics based on the quantitation of the rate of acquisition of resistance to endo H digestion of influenza HA ( Fig . 1 A ) . To examine the effect of PI5K on the kinetics of post - Golgi transport , we staged newly synthesized radiolabeled HA in the TGN at 19 °C , and using a cell surface Actin Comet - mediated Apical Transport JUNE 2 , 2006• VOLUME 281•NUMBER 22 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 15377 trypsinization assay measured the rate of its delivery to the apical cell surface upon warming to 37 °C . Roughly 50 % of the total HA expressed in control cells reached the apical membrane within 1 h ( Fig . 1 B ) . In contrast , HA delivery was markedly stimulated in cells overexpressing PI5K ( (cid:4) 67 % at 1 h ) . WenextexaminedtheeffectofPI5KontheTGNtosurfacetransport kinetics of p75 , an apical marker not known to associate with lipid rafts in MDCK cells ( Fig . 1 C ) , as well as on the basolateral marker VSV - G ( Fig . 1 D ) . PI5K had no effect on the biosynthetic delivery of either of these proteins . Thus , the stimulatory effect of PI5K on surface delivery appears to be selective for raft - associated proteins . Overexpression of Ocrl Selectively Inhibits Biosynthetic Delivery of InfluenzaHA —ToexaminewhetherstimulationofPIP 2 synthesisinthe TGN was responsible for the stimulatory effect of PI5K , we compared the effect of overexpressing the TGN - localized PIP 2 5 (cid:1) - phosphatase Ocrl ( or as a control , expressing a phosphatase - deficient mutant of Ocrl ) on the delivery of HA and p75 . Because overexpression of both wild type and mutant Ocrl slowed intra - Golgi transport as assessed by monitoring endo H kinetics , we used [ 35 S ] sulfate to selectively radiola - bel proteins in the TGN . As shown in Fig . 1 E , expression of wild type Ocrl inhibited TGN to apical delivery of HA , whereas mutant Ocrl had no effect . Consistent with the selective effect of PI5K on HA delivery , FIGURE1 . TGNtoapicalmembranedeliveryofaraft - associatedproteinisselectivelymodulatedbyPI5KandOcrl .

Actin Comet - mediated Apical Transport 15378 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY VOLUME 281•NUMBER 22• JUNE 2 , 2006 neither wild type nor mutant Ocrl affected the kinetics of p75 delivery ( Fig . 1 F ) . PI5K Stimulates the Formation of Actin Comets in MDCK Cells —Be - cause PI5K - mediated actin comets have been implicated in the trans - port of raft - associated proteins ( 18 ) , we asked whether actin comet - mediated propulsion of HA transport carriers could be responsible for the stimulated surface delivery we observed . First , we sought to deter - mine the relationship between PI5K and actin in fixed cells . MDCK cells were infected with AV expressing PI5K , then fixed and processed for indirectimmunofluorescence16hlater . Actinfilamentswerevisualized using rhodamine phalloidin and the HA epitope tag on PI5K was detected using a monoclonal mouse antibody . PI5K colocalized exten - sively with actin filaments in confocal sections of MDCK cells ( Fig . 2 A ) . This is consistent with previous reports that PI5K is found in actin - rich fractions isolated from thrombin - activated platelets ( 25 ) . Next , we used alivecellapproachtodeterminewhetherPI5Kstimulatestheformation of actin comets . Actin comets have not previously been reported in MDCK cells . MDCK cells were seeded on glass coverslips , infected with AV encoding PI5K or control AV , and then incubated in the presence of 0 . 25 ng / ml DOX to suppress PI5K expression . The following day , the DOX was washed out and cells were microinjected with cDNA encod - ing GFP - actin . Random fields were imaged 5 h later for 4 - min intervals using an Olympus IX81 equipped with a (cid:2) 100 Olympus UPlanApo objective . Actin comets were defined as rapidly moving bursts of actin followed by a fading tail of presumably depolymerizing actin . Comets generated in MDCK cells were distinct but generally smaller than com - ets described by others using different cell lines , which have been reported to be up to 5 (cid:3) m in length ( 18 , 26 , 27 ) . Comets were observed in 7 % of control cells and in 27 % of the cells overexpressing PI5K ( Table 1 , Fig . 2 B , and supplementary movie ) . Additionally , we were able to increase the frequency of actin comet formation in control cells by addition of the protein kinase C activator PMA , which has been previously demonstrated to stimulate actin com - ets in vivo ( Table 1 ) ( 16 ) . PMA also stimulated the rate of apical delivery of HA to an extent comparable with that observed upon overexpression of PI5K ( Fig . 3 ) . Conversely , addition of 1 - butanol , which disrupts phos - pholipaseD - mediatedsynthesisofthePI5Kactivatorphosphatidicacid , profoundly inhibited the formation of PI5K - stimulated actin comets FIGURE 2 .

MDCK cells infected with AV - HA were radiolabeled for 15 min and chased for 2 h at 19°C . PMA ( 5 (cid:3) g / ml PMA ) , 1 - butanol ( n - butanol ; 1 % v / v ) , or t - butyl alcohol ( t - butanol ; 1 % v / v ) were added as indicated 10 min prior to the end of the chase period and included upon subsequentincubationat37°Cfortheindicatedtimes .

The effects of PMA on actin comets were quantitated using MDCK cells stably expressing GFP - actin .

In contrast , t - butyl alcohol , which does not affect phosphatidic acid synthesis , had no effect on comet formation or HA delivery ( Fig . 3 ) . The Effect of PI5K on HA Delivery Is Mediated through Arp2 / 3 —If actin comets are involved in the TGN to apical membrane delivery of HA , then blockade of the N - WASP - Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymeri - zation would be expected to inhibit HA transport . The WA domain of WASP / WAVE family proteins provides the binding sites for actin monomers and Arp2 / 3 , and when expressed in isolation is a potent inhibitor of N - WASP function ( 18 , 29 ) . As a control , we expressed the W domain , which binds to actin monomers but not to Arp2 / 3 ( 29 ) . Infection of MDCK cells with AVs encoding W or WA yielded com - parable levels of the expected protein products ( W (cid:4) 16 kDa ; WA (cid:4) 18 kDa ; Fig . 4 A ) . As expected , expression of WA abolished PI5K - mediated formation of actin comets , demonstrating effective inhibition of Arp2 / 3 function ( Table 1 ) . We next examined the effect of the WA domain and PI5Konthemorphologyofpolarized , filter - grownMDCKcells .

Moreover , neither tight junction morphology nor the position - ing and morphology of the Golgi complex was affected by expression of these constructs ( Fig . 4 , C and D ) , although we did notice in cells expressing very high levels of WA that the Golgi appeared to be some - what dispersed toward the edges of the cells . Interestingly , whereas WA was diffusely expressed throughout the cytoplasm of polarized MDCK cells as expected , PI5K was concentrated near the apical membrane , a region that contains the supranuclear Golgi complex and the actin - rich terminal web of these cells ( Fig . 4 C ) . WenextassessedtheimpactofWorWAdomainexpressiononearly transport of HA through the biosynthetic pathway by monitoring the kinetics of HA acquisition of endo H resistance . Expression of WA or W had no discernable effects on the kinetics of HA traffic through the early Golgi ( data not shown ) . Next , we examined the effects of these domains on HA delivery from the TGN to the plasma membrane . Expression of WA inhibited kinetics of HA delivery to the apical cell surface by approximately (cid:4) 50 – 75 % relative to control over a 60 - min chase period ( Fig . 5 , A and B ) . Expression of the W domain did not significantly alter the delivery of HA indicating that expression of WA was not generally disrupting actin - driven processes . As with PI5K expression , the effect of WA on HA delivery was on rate rather than sorting , as HA surface polarity measured after long chase times was not compromised ( not shown ) . The stimulatory and inhibitory effects of PI5K and WA on HA delivery kinetics were highly reproducible , and were statistically signif - icantasassessedbyStudent’s t testanalysisofmultipleexperiments ( Fig . 5 B ) . The inhibitory effect of the WA domain was specific for lipid raft - enriched apical cargo , as there was no effect of the domain on the apical delivery of p75 ( Fig . 5 C ) . Moreover , expression of WA had no effect on the delivery of a basolateral marker , VSV - G ( Fig . 5 D ) . HA Is Associated with Actin Comets in MDCK Cells —The data described above suggested the selective involvement of PI5K - stimu - lated , Arp2 / 3 - dependent actin comets in the TGN to apical mem - brane delivery of HA . To test whether newly synthesized HA could be visualized in association with actin comets , MDCK cells seeded on glass coverslips were co - infected with AV - PI5K and AV - HA for 8 h , and then incubated at 19 °C for 2 . 5 h to accumulate HA in the TGN . Samples were then warmed to 37 °C for 30 min , fixed , and processed for indirect immunofluorescence to visualize actin , HA , and PI5K ( Fig . 6 ) . Numerous actin comets were detected in these cells , many of which stained positively for both PI5K and HA ( Fig . 6 , arrows ) . In 25 images we observed 71 comets of which 20 ( 28 % ) were positive for both HA and PI5K . By contrast , in 20 images we observed 57 comets of which only 2 ( 3 . 5 % ) were positive for p75 and PI5K . Together with our biochemical data , these studies provide strong evidence of a novel role for actin comets in polarized biosynthetic delivery of lipid raft - associated proteins . Efficient Apical Delivery of HA Requires Intact Actin and Microtubule Networks —The selective requirement for Arp2 / 3 in cell surface delivery of HA delivery suggests a role for actin dynamics in apical membrane traffic .

Actin Comet - mediated Apical Transport JUNE 2 , 2006• VOLUME 281•NUMBER 22 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 15381 resulted in dramatic inhibition of HA surface delivery as expected , but also had profound effects on the polarity of HA delivery , most likely due to global changes in actin cytoskeleton structure and cell morphology ( data not shown ) . However , the actin network in and of itself cannot confer directionality of transport , and targeted movement of at least some apically destined transport carriers in polarized cells has previ - ously been ascribed to microtubule - dependent mechanisms ( 30 – 34 ) . Moreover , inhibition of Arp2 / 3 function and actin comet formation by the WA domain or 1 - butanol treatment did not completely block HA surface delivery in polarized MDCK cells . We therefore examined whether Arp2 / 3 functions synergistically with the microtubule network to enable efficient and polarized delivery of HA . Polarized MDCK cells co - infected with AV - HA and either control or WA - expressing AVs were radiolabeled and chased at 19 °C for 2 h . Prior to warming , cells were pretreated with the microtubule - depolymerizing agent nocoda - zole and HA delivery was assayed after a 1 - h chase ( Fig . 7 ) . As expected , expression of WA or treatment with nocodazole alone partially inhib - ited delivery of HA ( Fig . 7 ) , and at this relatively short chase time , the polarity of delivery was intact ( not shown ) . Interestingly , the effect of jointly disrupting Arp2 / 3 function and microtubule structure was addi - tive , resulting in a nearly total blockade in HA delivery to the apical membrane . The dramatic inhibition of apical delivery was maintained over longer chase periods ( up to 4 h ; not shown ) . Treatment with nocodazole ( either alone or with WA ) also inhibited delivery of HA to the basolateral surface as well ( not shown ) . These data suggest that HA - containing transport carriers utilize both Arp2 / 3 and microtubule - dependent mechanisms to reach the apical surface , and that ablation of bothmechanismstogetherresultsinaprofounddisruptionintransport . DISCUSSION Here we have investigated the role of PIP 2 metabolism in polarized biosynthetic traffic . Expression of PI5K in polarized MDCK cells mark - edly stimulated TGN to apical delivery of the lipid raft - associated pro - tein influenza HA , whereas overexpression of Ocrl inhibited delivery . Delivery of the non - raft - associated apical protein p75 and the basolat - eral marker VSV - G were unaffected by PI5K . Overexpression of PI5K also caused a dramatic stimulation in actin comets that was blocked by inhibition of Arp2 / 3 function upon expression of the WA domain of Scar1 . Importantly , expression of this domain also selectively slowed HA transport . Moreover , pharmacological stimulation of actin comet formation by the protein kinase C activator PMA or inhibition by 1 - bu - tanol had parallel effects on HA delivery . HA and PI5K were visualized inassociationwithactincomets , confirmingaroleforArp2 / 3 - mediated comet formation in HA transport . Disruption of actin and microtubules together had a synergistic effect on apical transport , suggesting that the two cytoskeletal assemblies normally act in concert to direct efficient apical transport . Together , our data suggest that apical transport of raft - dependent and - independent cargo is differentially regulated , and that raft - dependent cargo are transported via a protein kinase C , PIP 2 - and Arp2 / 3 - dependent pathway consistent with the involvement of actin comets .

Actin Comet - mediated Apical Transport 15382 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY VOLUME 281•NUMBER 22• JUNE 2 , 2006 Role of Actin in Biosynthetic Traffic —Numerous studies have docu - mentedtherolesofactininintra - andpost - Golgitransport ( 35 ) . Thesehave ranged from observations of the presence of actin and actin - associated proteins associated with the Golgi complex ( 36 – 38 ) to more mechanistic insightsintothepotentialrolesofactinpolymerizationinbiosynthetictraf - fic ( 39 ) . Interestingly , the ADP - ribosylation factor ARF1 appears to be important for actin assembly on Golgi membranes ( 37 ) and this process requirescoatomer - boundcdc42andactivationoftheArp2 / 3complex ( 40 , 41 ) . Cdc42 may also regulate recruitment of dynein to coatomer protein complex I vesicles ( 42 ) . However , the consequences of these signaling cas - cades on intra - Golgi membrane traffic are not clear . We found no effect of expressionofeitherPI5KortheWAdomainofScar1onintra - Golgitrans - port kinetics , suggesting that PIP 2 - and Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymeri - zation are not required for the transport or maturation of cargo . ARF - dependent actin recruitment has also been implicated in post - Golgi transport . Recruitment to Golgi membranes of the actin - binding protein cortactin was shown to be ARF - dependent , and disruption of this complex in BHK cells had profound effects on the surface delivery of VSV - G without affecting intra - Golgi transport ( 43 ) . However , our labora - tory has previously demonstrated that TGN export of HA occurs inde - pendentlyofARFfunction ( 44 ) . Modulationofactindynamicsbytheclath - rin - and actin - binding protein Hip1R has also been suggested to regulate formation and release of clathrin - coated vesicles from the TGN ( 45 ) . Actin and Polarized Membrane Traffic —Specific roles for actin polymerization in the transport of apical proteins , and lipid raft - associ - ated cargo in particular , have previously been suggested . Rozelle et al . ( 18 ) observed that newly synthesized HA was preferentially localized to the tips of short polymers of actin reminiscent of N - WASP - dependent comets in PI5K - overexpressing cells . In support of this , PIP 2 has been suggested to be enriched in lipid rafts ( 46 – 48 ) although this conclusion has recently been challenged ( 49 , 50 ) . Moreover , our observation that expression of either PI5K or WA had no effect on apical delivery of a non - raft - associated protein adds support to the idea that transport of raft - associated and raft - independent proteins is differentially regulated . Jacob et al . ( 3 , 4 ) have previously suggested that biosynthetic transport carriers containing the lipid raft - associated hydrolase sucrase isomal - tase traffic via actin cables to the cell surface , whereas carriers enriched in the non - raft apical protein lactase - phlorizin hydrolase traffic in sep - arate carriers in an actin - independent manner . Recently , the same group identified (cid:2) - kinase 1 , which phosphorylates the motor protein myosinI , asacomponentofsucraseisomaltasebutnotlactase - phlorizin hydrolase - containing vesicles and demonstrated a role for this motor in apical delivery of sucrase isomaltase ( 51 ) . Whether (cid:2) - kinase 1 activity is important for the PI5K - mediated stimulation of HA delivery we observed is not known ; however , in a parallel scenario , both myosin motors and N - WASP - Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerization have been suggested as mechanisms that propel internalized endocytic vesi - cles through the actin - rich cortical cytoskeleton ( 16 , 52 – 55 ) . Role of PIP 2 Metabolism in Apical Membrane Traffic —What is the site of PI5K function in TGN to apical membrane delivery of HA ? Whereas no PI5K isoform has been localized to the Golgi complex , the majority of this enzyme was associated with actin filaments near the apical surface of polarized MDCK cells close to the supranuclear Golgi complex . However , there are indications that some apically destined proteins may traverse endosomal intermediates en route to the cell sur - face ( 56 – 58 ) , suggesting the possibility that the PI5K - and Ocrl - medi - ated effects on HA transport we observed might occur at post - TGN sites . Whereas the majority of Ocrl is localized to the TGN ( 15 ) , endo - somal localization of Ocrl has also been reported ( 59 , 60 ) and Lowe syndrome fibroblasts exhibit dramatically increased numbers of actin comets compared with normal fibroblasts ( 61 , 62 ) . Relationship between PI4P and PIP 2 Synthesis in Polarized Biosyn - thetic Traffic —Previously we found that overexpression of wild type PI4KIII (cid:1) or expression of frequenin / NCS - 1 , which stimulates PI4KIII (cid:1) activity , inhibited apical delivery kinetics of HA , suggesting a negative regulatory role for PI4P in TGN to apical membrane transport ( 8 , 63 ) . A selective role in apical membrane traffic for the PI4P - binding protein Fapp2 has also been demonstrated ( 64 ) . Our observation here thatover - expression of PI5K stimulates apical delivery is at odds with a simplistic precursor - product view of phosphatidylinositol metabolism in which changes in PI4P lead to parallel changes in PIP 2 . Indeed , we have previ - ously found that PI4KIII (cid:1) - mediated increases in cellular PI4P levels do not affect PIP 2 levels ( 8 ) . It is possible that PI5K - mediated conversion of PI4P to PIP 2 might stimulate membrane traffic by relieving the inhibi - tory effect of PI4P ; however , this is unlikely given the high levels of PI4P in the Golgi complex relative to PIP 2 . It is also possible that overexpres - sion of PI5K causes localized changes in PI4P distribution ; however , a more likely scenario is that PI4P and PIP 2 function independently to modulate distinct steps in membrane transport . Concerted Cytoskeletal Function in Polarized Membrane Traffic —Re - gardless of the role ( s ) for actin polymerization in apical membrane traf - fic , it is likely that the long - range directionality of biosynthetic mem - brane traffic is provided ultimately by the microtubule network . Previous biochemical studies have demonstrated a role for microtu - bulesinpolarizedmembranetransportinMDCKcells ( 31 , 32 , 65 , 66 ) . In addition , live cell imaging has clearly shown that VSV - G - containing transport carriers move to the plasma membrane on microtubule tracks ( 67 , 68 ) . We found that disruption of actin with cytochalasin D ( not shown ) or by expression of WA in concert with nocodazole treatment virtually abolished delivery of HA to the apical membrane , and ulti - mately disrupted the polarity of delivery . In contrast , expression of WA alone had no effect on HA polarity . Our data are reminiscent of studies by Maples et al . ( 69 ) who demonstrated a concerted role for actin and microtubules in basolateral to apical transcytosis of the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor . Our results do not necessarily suggest that actin comets are obligatory for apical delivery , but rather that they may facilitate apical transport of HA under some conditions . We hypothesize that actin - based movement of HA - containing transport carriers facilitates their access to microtubule tracks that provide the directionality for efficient transport to the apical mem - FIGURE7 .
