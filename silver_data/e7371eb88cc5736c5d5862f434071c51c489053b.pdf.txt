In this 50 study , we evaluated the enrichment of pathogenic germline variants in Ewing sarcoma relative 51 to other pediatric sarcoma subtypes , as well as patterns of inheritance of these variants . We 52 carried out an ancestry - matched case - control analysis to screen for enrichment of pathogenic 53 germline variants in 141 established cancer predisposition genes in 1138 individuals with 54 pediatric sarcoma diagnoses ( 222 Ewing sarcoma cases ) relative to identically processed 55 cancer - free controls . Findings in Ewing sarcoma were validated with an additional cohort of 425 56 individuals , and 301 Ewing sarcoma parent - proband trios were analyzed for inheritance patterns 57 of identified pathogenic variants . A distinct pattern of pathogenic germline variants was seen in 58 Ewing sarcoma relative to other sarcoma subtypes . FANCC was the only gene with an 59 enrichment signal for heterozygous pathogenic variants in the discovery Ewing sarcoma cohort 60 ( OR 14 . 4 , 95 % CI 3 . 5 – 51 . 2 , p = 0 . 002 , FDR = 0 . 28 ) . This enrichment in FANCC heterozygous 61 pathogenic variants was seen again in the Ewing sarcoma validation cohort ( OR 5 . 1 , 95 % CI 62 1 . 2 – 18 . 5 , p = 0 . 03 , single hypothesis ) , representing a broader importance of genes involved in 63 DNA damage repair , which were also nominally enriched in Ewing sarcoma cases . Pathogenic 64 variants in DNA damage repair genes were acquired through autosomal inheritance . Our study 65 provides new insight into germline risk factors contributing to Ewing sarcoma pathogenesis . 66 67 Introduction 68 Ewing sarcoma is the second most common bone and soft tissue cancer impacting 69 children and adolescents worldwide 1 . It is an aggressive malignancy that is metastatic in 25 % of 70 cases at presentation and requires a very intensive treatment regimen including multiple 71 chemotherapies , as well as surgery or radiation for local control . While overall survival for 72 localized disease has improved to 75 % , treatment confers significant morbidity , and cure rates 73 .

Through a better understanding of the 74 predisposing genetic factors contributing to Ewing sarcoma pathogenesis , the pediatric 75 oncology community would be able to develop more informed and less toxic treatment 76 regimens , as well as better screen children at risk for disease , opening the door to opportunities 77 for earlier detection and even prevention . 78 Ewing sarcoma is driven by EWSR1 - ETS gene fusions 1 , 3 , and is often characterized by 79 a complex rearrangement pattern known as chromoplexy 4 . The genetic events preceding these 80 simple and complex rearrangements remain largely unknown . Prior work has suggested a role 81 for pathogenic germline variants in DNA damage repair ( DDR ) genes in Ewing sarcoma , but 82 systematic case - control analyses to precisely define this role have not been undertaken 5 , 6 . 83 Much of what is known about germline predisposition to Ewing sarcoma has centered on 84 common population variants identified as susceptibility loci from genome - wide association 85 studies ( GWAS ) 1 , 7 – 9 , and a comprehensive evaluation of the relative contribution of rare coding 86 pathogenic germline variants is largely incomplete . 87 Furthermore , a more complete understanding of the familial inheritance patterns of 88 genetic risk factors in Ewing sarcoma is needed to guide cascade testing strategies with broad 89 potential clinical impact . While guidelines for familial testing have been developed for various 90 cancer predisposition syndromes 10 , 11 , patients with Ewing sarcoma and family members are not 91 uniformly referred for genetic testing . Case reports of siblings with metachronous Ewing 92 sarcoma diagnoses have suggested that germline variants shared within families may increase 93 risk , but these have not yet been identified 12 . Family - based germline sequencing , such as the 94 analysis of parent - proband trios , is thus a powerful tool for better understanding the inheritance 95 of pathogenic germline variants in pediatric sarcoma generally , and Ewing sarcoma in 96 particular 13 . 97 We hypothesized that through a systematic comparative analysis of germline 98 predisposition across pediatric sarcoma subtypes , we would elucidate distinct patterns of rare 99 .

We therefore undertook a three - stage study 100 comprising 1 ) an ancestry - matched case - control analysis utilizing a discovery pan - sarcoma 101 cohort , 2 ) validation with an ancestry - matched case - control analysis of an additional cohort of 102 patients with Ewing sarcoma , and 3 ) evaluation of inheritance in germline variants for patients 103 with Ewing sarcoma and their parents . 104 105 Materials and Methods 106 Ethics Approval and Consent to Participate 107 Written informed consent from patients and institutional review board approval , allowing 108 comprehensive genetic analysis of germline samples , were obtained by the original studies that 109 enrolled patients . The secondary genomic and deep - learning analyses performed for this study 110 were approved under Dana - Farber Cancer Institute institutional review board protocols 21 - 143 111 and 20 - 691 . This study conforms to the Declaration of Helsinki . 112 Study Participants 113 A total of 1138 individuals with pediatric sarcoma diagnoses were included in the 114 discovery cohort ( Supplemental Methods ) . A combination of germline whole - genome 115 sequencing ( WGS ) and whole - exome sequencing ( WES ) was aggregated for these individuals 116 across four data sources ; WGS was converted to WES equivalents using predefined target 117 intervals to focus on coding variants only ( Supplemental Methods ) . For validation , germline 118 WGS for 425 individuals with Ewing sarcoma from the Gabriella Miller Kids First ( GMKF ) 119 program was utilized . For 301 individuals with Ewing sarcoma from GMKF , germline WGS for 120 parents was available ( 602 parents ) and used for analysis of inheritance among trios ( Tables S1 121 and S2 ; Supplemental Methods ) . Sequenced exomes for 24128 cancer - free individuals from six 122 cohorts were extensively quality controlled , identically processed , and analyzed in the same 123 way as cases for use as controls in this study ( Supplemental Methods ) . 124 Population Stratification 125 .

We used a trained 127 random forest classifier to assign one of the five 1000 Genomes defined super populations 128 ( European , African , Admixed American , East Asian , and South Asian ) to each sample in our 129 case and control cohorts . Cases and controls were matched on genetic ancestry composition 130 based on the first ten principal components from the preceding analysis ( Supplemental 131 Methods ) . 132 Germline Variant Characterization 133 We called germline variants with a deep learning method , DeepVariant , which has 134 shown superior sensitivity and specificity compared with a joint genotyping - based approach 135 ( version 0 . 8 . 0 ) 14 , 15 . High - quality coding variants were utilized for subsequent analyses 136 ( Supplemental Methods ) . 137 Gene Sets 138 We evaluated the prevalence of pathogenic variants in a list of established germline 139 cancer predisposition genes ( n = 141 ; Table S3 ) 16 – 19 . A subset of these genes had an 140 established role in DDR ( n = 43 ) . The low - penetrance founder CHEK2 variant ( p . Ile200Thr ) was 141 considered separately from other CHEK2 pathogenic variants . We also evaluated predefined 142 and non - mutually exclusive functional subsets of the DDR gene list for pathway - based 143 enrichment analysis , curated through evaluation of known primary biological function in the 144 Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man ( OMIM ) 20 and Reactome 21 databases : mismatch repair ( n 145 = 4 ) , Fanconi Anemia ( n = 16 ) , double - strand break repair ( n = 12 ) , and nucleotide excision 146 repair ( n = 6 ) . 147 Germline Variant Pathogenicity Evaluation 148 Based on ClinVar database and Variant Effect Predictor ( VEP ) consequence 149 annotations , all detected germline variants in cancer predisposition genes were classified into 150 five categories : benign , likely benign , variants of unknown significance , likely pathogenic , and 151 .

Only putative 152 loss - of - function , pathogenic , and likely pathogenic variants were included in this study ( hereafter 153 collectively referred to as pathogenic variants ) . Pathogenic variants were manually evaluated 154 using the raw genomic data and the Integrative Genomics Viewer ( IGV ; Supplemental Methods ; 155 Tables S4 , S5 , and S6 ) 23 , 24 . 156 Outcomes 157 The primary outcomes included gene - level enrichment analysis of germline pathogenic 158 variants in individuals with Ewing sarcoma compared to other pediatric sarcomas , validation of 159 enrichment findings in Ewing sarcoma , and analysis of mechanisms of inheritance among 160 germline pathogenic variants in Ewing sarcoma . The secondary outcomes included exploratory 161 gene and pathway level enrichment analysis of germline pathogenic variants in DDR genes in 162 Ewing sarcoma . 163 Statistical Analysis 164 Two - sided Fisher’s exact tests were used to calculate the odds ratios , 95 % confidence 165 intervals ( CIs ) , and P values of germline pathogenic variant enrichment in affected versus 166 unaffected cohorts for each of the examined cancer predisposition genes . P < 0 . 05 was the 167 threshold for nominal enrichment signal . For the discovery cohort , the false discovery rate 168 ( FDR ) was calculated using the Benjamini - Hochberg procedure ; FDR < 0 . 05 was used as the 169 threshold for enrichment meeting multiple hypothesis testing criteria for validation in the 170 absence of a secondary cohort ( applied to the discovery cohort ; Supplemental Methods ) . 171 172 Results 173 Study overview and characteristics of discovery and validation cohorts 174 Our discovery cohort of 1138 primarily pediatric patients with sarcoma comprised 175 osteosarcoma ( 436 cases ) , rhabdomyosarcoma ( 180 cases ) , Ewing sarcoma ( 222 cases ) , and 176 other subtypes ( 300 cases ; Figure 1A ) . The mean age of patients in the discovery cohort was 177 .

Our validation cohort 178 comprised 433 patients with Ewing sarcoma ; of these , 425 cases were available for an 179 ancestry - matched case - control study , and 301 cases were available as parent - proband trios for 180 evaluation for mechanisms of inheritance ( Figure 1A ) . The mean age of patients in the Ewing 181 sarcoma validation cohort was 13 . 3 years ( SD 6 . 6 years ) , and 54 % of patients were male 182 ( Figure 1C ) . The germline exome - wide mean target coverage for the discovery cohort samples 183 was 53 . 9X ( interquartile range [ IQR ] 37 . 6 – 66 . 3X ) , and for the Ewing sarcoma validation cohort 184 samples was 27 . 3X ( IQR 24 . 6 – 30 . 2X ) ; exome - wide variant call rates were satisfactory for all 185 samples ( Figure S1 ) . Differential coverage for evaluated genes was assessed , and overall 186 comparable between cases and controls ( Figure S2 ) . All samples had satisfactory indel rates , 187 variant transition - to - transversion rates , and genotype quality ( Figure S3 ) . 188 189 Pathogenic germline variants in cancer predisposition genes are enriched across 190 pediatric sarcoma histologic subtypes relative to cancer - free controls 191 We assessed the frequency of pathogenic germline variants in 141 established cancer 192 predisposition genes in our discovery cohort 16 – 19 . Our discovery cohort had broad representation 193 from five major continental ancestries ( Figure 2A ; Figure S4 ) ; control cohorts for comparison 194 were identically processed and ancestry - matched . The presence of pathogenic germline 195 variants was not significantly associated with age ( mean 10 . 9 vs . 10 . 5 years , p = 0 . 42 by two - 196 sided t - test ) or sex ( p = 0 . 81 by Fisher’s exact test ) . Across the pan - sarcoma discovery cohort , 197 nominal enrichment signal at p < 0 . 05 was observed for multiple genes previously implicated in 198 sarcoma pathogenesis , including TP53 , NF1 , and DICER1 5 , 18 , 25 ; nominal enrichment signal was 199 also seen for MUTYH , PALB2 , NTHL1 , and FANCC , genes with less prior supporting evidence 200 for their role in sarcoma germline predisposition . The enrichment in TP53 was greatest , 201 reaching significance at FDR < 0 . 05 across the pan - sarcoma discovery cohort ( Figure 2B ; Table 202 S7 ) . 203 .

For osteosarcoma , nominal enrichment signal was observed for 5 205 genes ( Table S8 ) . These included TP53 and RB1 , previously validated as important in germline 206 predisposition to osteosarcoma ( Figure 2C ) 26 ; once again , only TP53 reached significance at 207 FDR < 0 . 05 . RECQL also had nominal enrichment signal in osteosarcoma cases relative to 208 controls ; however , due to relative underpowering , the previously implicated predisposition gene 209 RECQL4 did not , despite a higher absolute frequency in cases relative to controls ( Figure S5 ) . 210 Nominal enrichment signal was also observed for MUTYH and FANCM , genes without 211 substantial prior evidence supporting their role in germline predisposition to osteosarcoma 27 . 212 In rhabdomyosarcoma , nominal enrichment signal was observed for TP53 , NF1 , and 213 DICER1 , genes that have previously been implicated in germline predisposition to pediatric 214 rhabdomyosarcoma 28 . We were able to redemonstrate a nominal enrichment signal for BRCA2 215 and CHEK2 , genes with a previous moderate level of evidence for a role in germline 216 predisposition to rhabdomyosarcoma 25 , 29 – 31 . No genes reached significance at FDR < 0 . 05 217 ( Figure 2D ; Table S9 ) . 218 In Ewing sarcoma , the only gene with nominal enrichment signal was FANCC , with 219 heterozygous pathogenic variants seen in 3 out of 222 cases ( 1 . 3 % , OR 14 . 4 , 95 % CI 3 . 5 – 220 51 . 2 , p = 0 . 002 , FDR = 0 . 28 ; Figure 2E ; Figure S5 ; Table S10 ) . Prior work had shown a general 221 association between germline variants in Fanconi Anemia pathway genes and translocation - 222 driven sarcomas , but the role of FANCC in germline predisposition to Ewing sarcoma had not 223 previously been reported to our knowledge 5 . In contrast to osteosarcoma and 224 rhabdomyosarcoma , no pathogenic germline TP53 variants were observed in Ewing sarcoma . 225 Thus , our enrichment analysis of pathogenic variants in our discovery cohort 226 demonstrated a unique pattern of predisposing variants across pediatric sarcoma subtypes , with 227 a strong enrichment signal for TP53 in all sarcoma subtypes except Ewing sarcoma . Having 228 demonstrated a distinct enrichment pattern among Ewing sarcoma cases relative to 229 .

Heterozygous 236 pathogenic germline FANCC variants were again enriched , seen in 3 of 425 cases ( 0 . 7 % , OR 237 5 . 1 , 95 % CI 1 . 2 – 18 . 5 , p = 0 . 03 , single hypothesis ; Figure 3A ) . The pooled odds ratio for 238 FANCC enrichment between discovery and validation cohorts remained significant ( 6 of 647 239 cases , 0 . 9 % , OR 7 . 7 , 95 % CI 3 . 1 – 19 . 3 , p < . 0001 ) . 240 Prior mechanistic work has demonstrated that FANCC knockout contributes to 241 rearrangement signatures consistent with homologous recombination deficiency 32 . We thus 242 asked whether the recurrent enrichment of FANCC represented a broader importance of DDR 243 genes in germline predisposition to Ewing sarcoma , as has been previously suggested 6 . We 244 performed an exploratory analysis in the Ewing sarcoma validation cohort on the subset of 43 245 cancer predisposition genes with specific DDR pathway roles . In aggregate , pathogenic variants 246 in DNA double - strand break repair ( DSB ) genes ( OR 1 . 8 , 95 % CI 1 . 1 – 3 . 0 , p = 0 . 02 ) and 247 nucleotide excision repair genes ( OR 2 . 8 , 95 % CI 1 . 2 – 5 . 9 , p = 0 . 01 ; Figure 3B , Table S11 ) 248 were enriched . While the discovery Ewing sarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma cohorts were 249 underpowered for a comparative pathway analysis ( Tables S12 and S13 ) , the discovery 250 osteosarcoma cohort was of comparable size . In aggregate , DDR genes were enriched in 251 discovery osteosarcoma cases ( OR 1 . 9 , 95 % CI 1 . 4 – 2 . 6 , p = 0 . 0001 , Figure S7 ) ; notably and 252 in contrast to Ewing sarcoma , this was driven largely by germline TP53 mutations , as the DSB 253 and nucleotide excision repair pathways were not significantly enriched ( Table S14 ) . In the 254 validation cohort of patients with Ewing sarcoma , the presence of pathogenic germline variants 255 .

In combination with FANCC , these four genes harbored germline pathogenic variants in 262 16 of 425 Ewing sarcoma cases ( 3 . 8 % ) , compared with 60 of 7259 controls ( 0 . 8 % ; Figure 3C ) . 263 Similar to our discovery Ewing sarcoma cohort , we once again identified no pathogenic 264 germline TP53 variants in our validation Ewing sarcoma cohort . The rate of pathogenic germline 265 TP53 variants in patients with Ewing sarcoma ( 0 % ) was significantly lower than that seen for all 266 sarcomas in aggregate ( 1 . 6 % , p = 0 . 006 by Fisher’s exact test ) , and osteosarcoma in particular 267 ( 2 . 8 % , p = 0 . 0005 by Fisher’s exact test ; Figure 3D ) . This , in combination with the recurrent 268 enrichment of pathogenic germline mutations in FANCC , as well as the collective enrichment of 269 DSB and nucleotide excision repair pathways , demonstrated a distinct pattern of germline 270 mutations in Ewing sarcoma relative to other pediatric sarcoma subtypes . 271 272 Pathogenic germline variants in DNA damage repair genes are inherited in high - risk 273 families 274 Having identified pathogenic germline mutations in FANCC and other DDR genes in 275 Ewing sarcoma , we next sought to assess inheritance of these variants . Thus , we evaluated the 276 301 patients with Ewing sarcoma from our validation cohort that were part of parent - proband 277 sequencing trios . Among these 301 patients , 32 harbored pathogenic germline variants in DDR 278 genes ( 10 . 6 % ; Figure 4A ) . In 32 of 32 probands in which a pathogenic germline DDR variant 279 was identified in a proband , the same germline DDR variant was identified in one of the parents 280 ( 100 % ) . In contrast , for probands in whom a pathogenic germline DDR variant was not 281 .

In three instances , heterozygous 289 germline pathogenic variants affecting multiple DDR genes were seen in probands , with each 290 variant also identified in a parent ( Figure 4D ) . 291 We sought to understand whether as yet unidentified de novo pathogenic variants in 292 other coding genes may coordinate with or complement the inherited DDR variants to explain a 293 significant proportion of the unexplained germline risk for developing pediatric Ewing sarcoma . 294 Based on prior frameworks 33 – 35 , we reasoned that finding pathogenic de novo variants 295 recurrently impacting the same gene in a cohort of 301 proband - parent trios would be highly 296 unlikely by chance , implicating potential additional candidate risk genes . However , in our cohort , 297 we identified recurrent pathogenic de novo germline variants in only one gene , TTN , which 298 occurred in two separate Ewing sarcoma cases . As the frequency of pathogenic germline 299 variants in TTN between cases and cancer - free controls was not significantly different and there 300 is no established biological role for TTN in Ewing sarcoma oncogenesis , there was insufficient 301 evidence to support its role in germline predisposition to Ewing sarcoma ( Figure S9 ) . 302 Taken together , pathogenic germline variants in DSB genes were present more 303 frequently in families of patients with Ewing sarcoma relative to cancer - free controls . Autosomal 304 inheritance , as opposed to de novo development , was the mechanism of inheritance of these 305 moderate penetrance risk variants . 306 307 .

Having 310 assembled germline sequencing data from 1138 patients with pediatric sarcoma diagnoses , we 311 undertook rigorous ancestry - matched case - control analyses and illustrated distinct patterns of 312 enrichment amongst pathogenic variants in Ewing sarcoma relative to osteosarcoma and 313 rhabdomyosarcoma . Supporting the validity of our approach , we were able to recover 314 enrichment signal in many cancer predisposition genes known to be associated with pediatric 315 sarcoma risk , such as TP53 , RB1 , and DICER1 . We additionally demonstrated enrichment 316 signal in several cancer predisposition genes with less well - characterized links to pediatric 317 sarcoma , most notably FANCC in Ewing sarcoma . We then validated the enrichment of 318 pathogenic germline variants in FANCC among patients with Ewing sarcoma using an 319 independent cohort of 425 unique patients . This recurrent enrichment of heterozygous 320 pathogenic germline variants in FANCC provides evidence for its role in increasing risk for some 321 cases of Ewing sarcoma , and raises the possibility that monoallelic germline variants in Fanconi 322 anemia genes may confer increased risk in other translocation - associated cancers . 323 We demonstrated that the enrichment in FANCC pathogenic germline variants 324 represented a broader importance of DNA damage repair ( DDR ) genes , and both the DNA 325 double - strand break ( DSB ) and nucleotide excision repair pathways in particular , for Ewing 326 sarcoma germline predisposition . While prior studies have identified occasional instances of 327 pathogenic germline TP53 variants amongst cases of Ewing sarcoma , through comparative 328 analyses , we found that the frequency of pathogenic germline TP53 variants among cases of 329 Ewing sarcoma was significantly lower in relation to other pediatric sarcoma subtypes 6 , 29 . This 330 finding is supported by the clinical observation that Ewing sarcoma is not frequently seen in 331 families with Li - Fraumeni syndrome 36 . 332 .

We found pathogenic germline variants 335 in DSB genes enriched amongst parents of patients with Ewing sarcoma . As moderate 336 penetrance risk variants that are also present in parents , we reasoned that pathogenic germline 337 variants in DDR genes play a substantial role in increasing risk for developing Ewing sarcoma , 338 but are likely not sufficient to cause the disease in isolation . However , we did not identify de 339 novo variants recurrently impacting other genes to support a role for their interaction with 340 pathogenic germline variants in DDR genes to promote germline predisposition to Ewing 341 sarcoma . 342 Our study had some notable limitations . While pathogenic germline variants in FANCC 343 occurred at a rate greater than expected by chance in cases of Ewing sarcoma , the overall 344 frequency of these variants was low ( 1 . 3 % in the discovery cohort , 0 . 7 % in the validation 345 cohort ) , supporting the role of FANCC as a moderate penetrance cancer predisposition gene as 346 opposed to the sole driver of disease pathogenesis . Additionally , our focus on germline variants 347 in select DDR genes within Ewing sarcoma likely underestimated the total contribution of rare 348 coding pathogenic germline variants to Ewing sarcoma pathogenesis . Finally , similar to much 349 preceding work in germline predisposition in pediatric cancers , our methods were limited to 350 identifying known pathogenic germline SNVs / indels conferring increased risk in pediatric 351 sarcoma . As progress is made in germline structural variant discovery 37 and placing rare 352 pathogenic variants in the context of complex germline interactions 38 – 41 , future studies and new 353 statistical frameworks will be needed to more completely define the role of germline 354 predisposition in Ewing sarcoma pathogenesis . 355 Taken together , our analysis supports a unique contribution of germline variants in 356 FANCC and other DDR genes to Ewing sarcoma pathogenesis .
