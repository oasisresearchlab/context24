Weeds 1 * 1 MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology , Cambridge , CB2 2QH England 2 Verna and Marrs McLean Department of Biochemistry Baylor College of Medicine Houston , TX USA The actin depolymerizing factor ( ADF ) / coﬁlin family of proteins interact with actin monomers and ﬁlaments in a pH - sensitive manner . When ADF / coﬁlin binds F - actin it induces a change in the helical twist and fragmentation ; it also accelerates the dissociation of subunits from the pointed ends of ﬁlaments , thereby increasing treadmilling or depolymeri - zation . Using site - directed mutagenesis we characterized the two actin - binding sites on human coﬁlin . One target site was chosen because we previously show ? ed that the villin head piece competes with ADF for binding to F - actin . Limited sequence homology between ADF / coﬁlin and the part of the villin headpiece essential for actin binding suggested an actin - binding site on coﬁlin involving a structural loop at the opposite end of the molecule to the a - helix already implicated in actin binding . Binding through the a - helix is primarily to monomeric actin , whereas the loop region is speciﬁcally involved in ﬁlament association . We have characterized the actin binding properties of each site independently of the other . Mutation of a single lysine residue in the loop region abolishes binding to ﬁlaments , but not to monomers . Using the mutation analo - gous to the phosphorylated form of coﬁlin ( S3D ) , we show that ﬁlament binding is inhibited at physiological ionic strength but not under low salt conditions . At low ionic strength , this mutant induces both the twist change and fragmentation characteristic of wild - type coﬁlin , but does not activate subunit dissociation . The results suggest a two - site binding to ﬁlaments , initiated by association through the loop site , followed by interaction with the adjacent subunit through the ‘‘helix’’ site at the opposite end of the molecule . Together , these interactions induce twist and fragmentation of ﬁlaments , but the twist change itself is not respon - sible for the enhanced rate of actin subunit release from ﬁlaments . # 2000 Academic Press Keywords : ADF ; coﬁlin ; actin ; villin ; UNC - 60A * Corresponding author Introduction Coﬁlin and the actin depolymerizing factor ( ADF ) are essential actin regulatory proteins , found in all eukaryotes that enhance the turnover of the actin cytoskeleton ( reviewed by Bamburg et al . , 1999 ; McGough et al . , 2000 ) . They bind mono - meric ( G - ) and ﬁlamentous ( F - ) actin in a pH - dependent manner ( Yonezawa et al . , 1985 ; Hawkins et al . , 1993 ; Hayden et al . , 1993 ) and have a higher afﬁnity for actin / ADP than actin / ATP ( Blanchoin & Pollard , 1998 ; Ressad et al . , 1998 ) . F - actin binding is cooperative and gives rise to a change in the twist of the ﬁlament , which may account for the weak severing activity observed with these proteins ( McGough et al . , 1997 ) . In addition to fragmenting ﬁlaments , they enhance the rate of dissociation of subunits from their pointed ends 25 to 30 - fold ( Carlier et al . , 1997 ; Maciver et al . , 1998 ) . The mechanism by which this occurs is not understood , but may relate to the change in twist ( McGough et al . , 1997 ) .

Together , these features render the ADF / coﬁlins highly efﬁcient , ﬁnely tuned regula - tors of actin dynamics in cells ( Moon & Drubin , 1995 ; Bamburg et al . , 1999 ) . Like many F - actin binding proteins , ADF / coﬁlin binds two adjacent subunits along the two - strand long pitch helix ( McGough , 1998 ) . Studies using peptide mimetics ( Yonezawa et al . , 1989 ) , point mutational analysis ( Moriyama et al . , 1992 ; Lappalainen et al . , 1997 ) , and competition exper - iments ( Nishida et al . , 1985 ) have identiﬁed the long a - helix L 111 to L 128 ( numbering for human coﬁlin ) as being one of the sites involved in bind - ing to both F - and G - actin . An extensive alanine - scanning mutational analysis of charged surface amino acid residues in yeast coﬁlin implicated a number of other residues as being involved in actin binding ( Lappalainen et al . , 1997 ) . In particu - lar , F - actin binding only was impaired in two mutants : one involving two basic residues at the beginning of strand b 4 , the second involving three residues in the C - terminal helix ( two basic and one acidic ) . All of these residues are close together in the atomic structure ( Fedorov et al . , 1997 ) . Here , we investigated the possibility of two actin - binding sites on coﬁlin using site - directed mutagenesis . The mutants produced permit us to analyze the binding properties of the individual sites and the interplay between them that result in the actin ﬁlament twist change , fragmentation , and depolymerization . One of the mutations was cho - sen because we had shown that ADF competes with the headpiece of villin for binding to F - actin ( Pope et al . , 1994 ) . Sequence comparisons between the villin headpiece and ADF / coﬁlin revealed a short stretch of homology between the C terminus of headpiece ( 70 KKEKGLF 76 ) and a region in the middle of the human coﬁlin ( 95 KKEDLVF 101 ) . The KKEK residues of the headpiece had been shown to be essential for F - actin binding ( Friederich et al . , 1992 ) . The ﬁrst two basic residues are also con - served in yeast coﬁlin ( 79 KRSKIV 84 ) and are located in one of the regions highlighted by Lappalainen as essential for F - actin binding ( Lappalainen et al . , 1997 ) . These residues form part of an extended loop at the opposite end of the molecule to the site involving the long helix ( Hatanaka et al . , 1996 ; Fedorov et al . , 1997 ) . We mutated these lysine resi - dues to glutamine ( K95Q , K96Q ) and studied the effects on ﬁlament binding , depolymerization and severing . We also prepared the S3D mutant , which has been shown to inhibit actin binding ( Agnew et al . , 1995 ; Moriyama et al . , 1996 ; Arber et al . , 1998 ) . This has enabled us to study the effects of binding through the loop when binding through the long helix was inhibited . The two mutants are termed ‘‘loop mutant’’ and S3D , respectively . A further variant of the loop mutant ( K96Q ) was also prepared and a double mutant in which both of these sites were modiﬁed simultaneously ( S3D , K96Q ) . Our results show that the loop mutant does not co - sediment with F - actin , but binds monomers and shows a weak acceleration of ﬁlament disassembly . The S3D mutant also fails to bind F - actin at physio - logical ionic strength , showing that the afﬁnity of the loop site on its own is insufﬁcient for ﬁlament interaction . However , at lower ionic strength values , S3D both binds F - actin and induces the twist change characteristic of wild - type coﬁlin . Filament fragmentation accompanies this increase in twist , yet there was only a minimal increase in the rate of release of actin subunits . The results conﬁrm the presence of two distinct sites on coﬁlin for actin binding : one , identiﬁed using the loop mutant ( K95Q , K96Q ) involved in monomer bind - ing , and the second , identiﬁed using the S3D mutant , binds to ﬁlaments . In the F - actin bound state , these two sites interact with subdomains 1 and 2 of the lower adjacent subunit in the two - start helix ( termed 1 - 2L ) and subdomains 1 and 3 of the upper subunit , respectively ( termed 1 - 3U , closer to the pointed end of the ﬁlament ) . Filament binding is salt - sensitive and probably involves a two - step process akin to that for gelsolin : targeting the 1 - 2L region of one actin through the loop - site facilitates subsequent interaction of the ‘‘helix’’ site with the 1 - 3U region of the adjacent subunit , there - by inducing both the twist change and fragmenta - tion . The results suggest that the increase in ﬁlament twist is not in itself responsible for the increase in depolymerization rate . Results Point mutations ADF and the villin headpiece compete for actin ﬁlament binding ( Pope et al . , 1994 ) . ClustalW mul - tiple sequence alignment ( Thompson et al . , 1994 ) highlighted the sequence 70 KKEKGLF 76 at the C terminus of the headpiece as being similar to 95 KKEDLVF 101 in human coﬁlin ( Figure 1 ( a ) ) . These residues form part of a loop structure at the opposite end of coﬁlin to the proposed actin - bind - ing region of the long helix ( Figure 1 ( b ) ) . We mutated the two adjacent lysine residues to gluta - mine to retain as far as possible the large , polar character of these residues , and thus preserve the tertiary structural stability of coﬁlin . Although a basic residue is conserved at position K96 in all coﬁlins ( with the exception of those from Caenor - habditis elegans ( Ono & Benian , 1998 ) ) , both plant coﬁlins and actophorin already have glutamine residue in the position of K95 . We therefore con - structed a single point mutation , K96Q , to test whether this mutation alone gave the same pheno - type . We also prepared the S3D mutant , which has been shown to inhibit actin binding ( Agnew et al . , 1995 ; Moriyama et al . , 1996 ; Arber et al . , 1998 ) and constructed a double mutant at both the regulatory site and the loop site ( S3D , K96Q ) . 650 Coﬁlin - Actin Twist and Subunit Turnover Protein folding The mutants were expressed and puriﬁed in a similar manner and ﬁnal purity to wt - coﬁlin and ADF ( Hawkins et al . , 1993 ) . Folding of all mutants was analyzed by circular dichroism and found to be as for wt ( plots not shown ) . Thus , any differ - ences in activity are due to the effects of these localized charge changes and not to folding abnormalities arising from the amino acid residue replacements . Actin binding wt - cofilin ADF and coﬁlin have been routinely assayed for binding to ﬁlaments using co - sedimentation in 100 mM salt at a pH value of less than 7 . Figure 2 shows the effects of ionic strength on actin binding at pH 6 . 3 . Binding to F - actin decreased sharply with increasing ionic strength above about 120 mM salt and was eliminated at 250 mM NaCl ( Figure 2 ( a ) ) . By contrast , the extent of depolymeri - zation increased linearly with ionic strength to about 120 mM NaCl and remained constant at higher salt concentrations ( Figure 2 ( b ) ) . The maxi - mum extent of depolymerization was about 5 m M actin , much of which was complexed with coﬁlin . It should be noted that sedimentation of F - actin alone was also shown to increase the actin concen - tration in the supernatant by about 1 . 5 m M at 0 . 3 M NaCl . Taken together , these results show that the binding of coﬁlin to F - actin is reduced with increasing salt concentration . Figure 1 . ( a ) Sequence align - ments of coﬁlin / ADF .

The sites on the adjacent actins are denoted by the numbers of the cor - responding subdomains : 1 - 3U in boxes and 1 - 2L in circles . Coﬁlin - Actin Twist and Subunit Turnover 651 Loop mutants Unlike wt - coﬁlin , the K95Q , K96Q mutant ( or the single point mutant K96Q ) did not co - sediment with F - actin at pH 6 . 3 ( Figure 2 ( a ) ) . Further exper - iments were carried out to explore weak binding that might not be detected by co - sedimentation . We previously reported that human ADF quenched the ﬂuorescence of pyrene - labelled F - actin ( PI - actin ) ( Maciver et al . , 1998 ) , although the effect was much less marked than that of Arabidop - sis ADF1 ( Carlier et al . , 1997 ) . When wt - coﬁlin was mixed with the 100 % PI - F - actin there was an immediate drop in the ﬂuorescence ( Figure 3 ( a ) ) . The amplitude of ﬂuorescence quenching increased linearly with coﬁlin concentration and at a 1 : 1 molar ratio of wt - coﬁlin to actin , the ﬂuorescence was over 90 % quenched ( Figure 3 ( b ) ) . The K95Q , K96Q mutant gave only a negligible instan - taneous drop in ﬂuorescence even at equimolar ratios ( Figure 3 ( b ) ) . This ﬂuorescence change was Figure 2 .

Half - maximal binding occurs at NaCl concentrations of (cid:24) 160 mM for coﬁlin and (cid:24) 60 mM for S3D . There is negligible binding with K95Q , K96Q .

Figure 3 . Binding of coﬁlin and loop mutant to F - actin . ( a ) Time - course of the ﬂuorescence change on mix - ing 4 m M wt - coﬁlin ( lower trace ) or loop mutant ( upper trace ) with 5 m M PI - actin ( 100 % labeled ) in 10 mM bis - Tris ( pH 6 . 5 ) , containing 1 mM MgCl 2 and 20 mM NaCl . ( b ) Instantaneous drop in ﬂuorescence as a func - tion of the concentration of wt - coﬁlin ( triangles ) or loop mutant ( squares ) with 5 m M PI - actin as above . K d - values estimated from the slopes were : coﬁlin (cid:136) 0 . 4 m M and K95Q , K96Q (cid:136) 300 m M . 652 Coﬁlin - Actin Twist and Subunit Turnover approximately that expected from the effects of dilution , suggesting little or no interaction with the ﬁlaments . For both wt and mutant coﬁlins , after the instantaneous drop , the ﬂuorescence decreased exponentially with time , consistent with depoly - merization ( Figure 3 ( a ) ) . Assuming that the ﬂuor - escence drop in the initial phase is a quantitative measure of binding , we estimate from the two slopes that binding by the mutant is about 1000 - fold weaker than that of wt - coﬁlin . ( The K d - value for wt - coﬁlin ( 0 . 4 m M ) is similar to that measured for Acanthamoeba actophorin with rabbit muscle actin ( Blanchoin & Pollard , 1999 ) ) . Although there is negligible binding of the K95Q , K96Q mutant to F - actin , it nevertheless induces ﬁlament depolymerization . Figure 2 ( b ) shows that above 120 mM NaCl , the loop mutant depolymerized F - actin at a similar level to wt - coﬁ - lin , but the extent of depolymerization increased as the ionic strength was reduced and was almost complete at 10 mM NaCl . To test the effects of ionic strength on complex formation , we analyzed supernatant fractions from these assays by FPLC on Superdex 75 columns . Results showed that actin was complexed 1 : 1 with mutant under all salt conditions tested between 10 mM and 300 mM . The afﬁnity of the mutant for G - actin / ADP was determined using e - ATP exchange . The K d - value in 100 mM NaCl ( 0 . 33 m M ) was slightly higher than that of wt - coﬁlin ( 0 . 12 m M ) ( Figure 4 ) . S3D mutant This mutant did not co - sediment with F - actin in 100 mM salt at pH 6 . 3 , but F - actin binding increased at lower salt concentrations and was complete at below 40 mM NaCl ( Figure 2 ( a ) ) . Like wt - coﬁlin ( McGough et al . , 1997 ) , S3D binding was cooperative ( Figure 5 ) , but a Hill coefﬁcient of 2 . 2 was much lower than the value of 6 . 4 obtained for wt - coﬁlin under standard salt conditions ( McGough et al . , 1997 ) . The greatly reduced afﬁnity of S3D for F - actin can be appreciated from the fact that 50 % binding occurs at 33 m M free S3D ( Figure 5 ) , which compares to 9 m M for wt - coﬁlin in 100 mM NaCl ( McGough et al . , 1997 ) . The importance of ionic interactions in the binding of this mutant can be appreciated from the obser - vation that 50 % binding occurs at 60 mM NaCl for S3D compared to 160 mM NaCl for wt - coﬁlin ( Figure 2 ( a ) ) . Figure 4 shows that the K d - value for actin / ADP in physiological salt ( 3 . 6 m M ) is 30 - fold higher than wt - coﬁlin ( 0 . 12 m M ) and a similar ratio of afﬁnities was observed in the absence of salt ( 0 . 76 m M com - pared with 0 . 03 m M ) . Double mutant Because at 20 mM NaCl ( pH 6 . 3 ) S3D binds ﬁla - ments , while K96Q induces depolymerization , a double mutant containing both changes is pre - dicted neither to bind F - actin nor induce depoly - merization . Our results conﬁrmed this prediction ; S3D , K96Q did not co - sediment with ﬁlaments ( data not shown ) . Figure 6 compares the extent of depolymerization of these mutants at both pH 6 . 5 and 8 . 0 . Results show that the double mutant induces negligible depolymerization , particularly when compared with K96Q , which is most efﬁcient in maintaining ﬁlament disassembly . Figure 4 .

Coﬁlin - Actin Twist and Subunit Turnover 653 Depolymerization rates The depolymerizing activity of the loop mutant may arise solely because it sequesters monomers . However , because ADF and related proteins accel - erate subunit dissociation from the pointed ends of ﬁlaments ( Carlier et al . , 1997 ; Maciver et al . , 1998 ) , we measured the effects of these mutants on the rate of actin depolymerization using PI - actin ﬂuor - escence with gelsolin - capped ﬁlaments . Both mutants had a limited activating effect on the dis - assembly process : the slope for the loop mutant was 12 % of wt - coﬁlin and that for S3D was 8 % ( Figure 7 ( a ) ) . We also monitored depolymerization and dis - sociation of coﬁlin / actin complexes from the rate of release of actin / e - ADP from gelsolin - capped ﬁlaments . In 80 mM NaCl there was approxi - mately 50 - fold enhancement with wt - coﬁlin , whereas the loop mutant showed only ﬁvefold activation . Moreover , this activation required a sig - niﬁcantly higher concentration of loop mutant ( Figure 7 ( b ) , enlarged in 7 ( c ) ) . S3D gave no acti - vation whatsoever under these conditions ( data not shown ) . At lower ionic strength ( 10 mM NaCl ) both mutants gave maximally four - to ﬁvefold acti - vation , at a similar stoichiometry to the maximum observed with wt - coﬁlin ( 0 . 5 coﬁlin : 1 actin ; Figure 7 ( b ) and ( c ) ) . Electron microscopy Control F - actin was imaged at low magniﬁcation ( 10 , 000 ) so that full lengths of the long ﬁlaments might be measured . Filament lengths were typi - cally 4 - 6 m m . Samples treated with coﬁlin showed considerably shorter ﬁlaments : ADF or coﬁlin at 2 - 3 : 1 molar ratios to actin reduced the mean ﬁlament length to (cid:24) 15 % of the control , whether added 30 seconds or 30 minutes prior to ﬁxation ( Table 1 ) . Similar lengths were obtained when G - actin and coﬁlin were mixed and left overnight to polymer - ize . By contrast , samples treated with the F - actin binding domain of gelsolin , G2 - 3 ( Way et al . , 1992b ) , gave a similar length to controls , indicating that ﬁlament shortening is not a consequence of shearing due to the mixing process or of increased fragility when the ﬁlaments are decorated with an F - actin binding protein . Although the standard deviations of the measurements are high , showing considerable polydispersity of length , the exper - iments demonstrated that coﬁlin reduced the mean ﬁlament lengths to 0 . 7 m m , equivalent to about seven severing events per ﬁlament . Neither the S3D nor the loop mutant affected the mean ﬁlament length in 100 mM salt ( Table 1 ) . However , in 20 mM NaCl , using a 10 : 1 molar ratio to F - actin to ensure saturation ( Figure 2 ( b ) ) , the mean ﬁlament length in the presence of S3D was Figure 6 .

All other samples are for F - actin after mixing with coﬁlin or mutants . Similar experiments using Zea mays ADF or Acanthamoeba actophorin fragmented ﬁlaments to 0 . 72 m m ( 250 monomers ) and 0 . 83 m m ( 300 monomers ) , respectively . a Polymerized in 20 mM salt using higher ratios of coﬁlin or mutant to actin ( 8 - 12 : 1 ) . In 20 mM salt , the loop mutant ( K95Q , K96Q ) completely depolymerized the ﬁlaments . The lengths were converted to actin subunits using a rise of 2 . 75 nm per actin ( Holmes et al . , 1990 ) . 654 Coﬁlin - Actin Twist and Subunit Turnover 0 . 4 ( (cid:6) 0 . 26 ) m m , compared to a value of 0 . 3 ( (cid:6) 0 . 24 ) m m using wt - coﬁlin at the same ratio ( n (cid:136) 50 in both cases ) ( Table 1 and Figure 8 ) . Using the loop mutant at a similar molar ratio ( 8 : 1 ) under similar ionic conditions gave complete depolymerization of F - actin within the few minutes necessary to pre - pare grid samples . Filament twist measurements Figure 9 presents electron micrographs of bare F - actin and F - actin decorated with either wt - coﬁlin ( McGough et al . , 1997 ) or the S3D mutant . Both types of decorated ﬁlaments are about 20 % larger in diameter compared to bare F - actin . The cross - over lengths are difﬁcult to measure in the raw images . However , in the calculated diffraction pat - terns , the crossover lengths may be determined from the position of the ﬁrst layerline . Crossover length measurements conﬁrm that the S3D mutant retains the ability to change ﬁlament twist . The mean crossover length determined for S3D deco - rated ﬁlaments ( 3 . 5 : 1 ) was 266 A˚ ( SD (cid:136) 5 A˚ , N (cid:136) 19 ) , compared to 270 A˚ ( SD (cid:136) 4 A˚ , N (cid:136) 30 ) for wt - coﬁlin and 361 A˚ ( SD (cid:136) 7 A˚ , N (cid:136) 28 ) for bare ﬁlaments . Discussion Stable interaction of ADF / coﬁlin with F - actin , like that of other ﬁlament binding proteins requires interaction with two adjacent subunits ( McGough , 1998 ) . Here , by mutating residues at opposite ends of the coﬁlin molecule , we have characterized the interactions at the two sites in terms of the overall activities of ADF / coﬁlin . Mutants that bind the 1 - 3U site enhance disassembly without stable filament binding Mutation of basic residues in the loop site showed insigniﬁcant F - actin binding as measured by co - sedimentation or ﬂuorescence quenching of PI - actin over a wide range of salt concentrations . Nevertheless , this mutation did not inhibit ﬁlament depolymerization or monomer binding . Our results show that the afﬁnity of F - actin binding by this mutant is two to three orders of magnitude weaker than that of wt - coﬁlin . This is because this mutation abolishes the interaction between coﬁlin and the 1 - 2L site and it is through this site that coﬁlin stabilizes F - actin ( Figure 1 ( b ) ) . ( Interaction through the 1 - 2L site is demonstrated by the bind - Figure 7 . Effects of wt - coﬁlin and K95Q , K96Q on depolymerization rates .

Reaction was initiated by the addition of 1 mM ATP after mixing the coﬁlin or mutants with the ﬁlaments .

Coﬁlin - Actin Twist and Subunit Turnover 655 ing of S3D to F - actin ( Figure 2 ( a ) ) , since in S3D the 1 - 3U site is disrupted . ) Filaments are maximally stabilized at pH 6 . 3 when both the 1 - 2L and 1 - 3U contacts are involved . A further distinction between the loop mutant and wt - coﬁlin is that , at reduced ionic strength , the loop mutant shows greatly increased ﬁlament depolymerization at pH 6 . 3 compared to wt - coﬁlin ( Figure 2 ( b ) ) . Because the K d - value of the loop mutant for G - actin / ADP is close to the critical con - centration of actin , in the presence of excess mutant , depolymerization will be favored . More - over , because this K d - value was lower in the absence of salt than at 100 mM NaCl ( 0 . 14 m M compared to 0 . 33 m M ( Figure 4 ) ) , the extent of depolymerization should be higher as the ionic strength is reduced . This effect is observed in Figure 2 ( b ) . The enhanced depolymerization observed with the loop mutant is not simple sequestration of monomeric actin , because the rate is accelerated in the presence of the mutant ( Figure 7 ( c ) ) , albeit at only one - tenth of the level seen with wt - coﬁlin . This acceleration in the absence of signiﬁcant bind - ing to ﬁlaments is most readily explained if the mutant interacts with terminal subunits , resulting in their release in complex with mutant . Formation of complexes between the loop mutant and G - actin demonstrates stable binding to the 1 - 3U site and similar binding may also occur with terminal sub - units at either end of the ﬁlaments . Terminal sub - units are more weakly associated to their neighbors than internal subunits ( Korn , 1982 ) , because they are held in place by one longitudinal bond between neighbors in the long - pitch helix and one lateral contact in the genetic helix . Because both of these contacts are disrupted by coﬁlin bind - ing ( McGough et al . , 1997 ; McGough & Chiu , 1999 ) , any interaction of the loop mutant with the 1 - 3U site of terminal subunits will destabilize these subunits and accelerate their dissociation . The experiments shown in Figure 7 were carried out with gelsolin - capped ﬁlaments and relate only to pointed - end depolymerization . Preliminary exper - iments using uncapped ﬁlaments showed a higher activation by the loop mutant relative to wt - coﬁlin , suggesting that this effect may also occur at barbed ends . Comparative sequence analysis shows strong conservation of key basic residues in the loop region in ADF / coﬁlin homologues where F - actin binding is observed . For example , the nematode homologue , UNC - 60A is 165 amino acid residues long ( the same size as the vertebrate ADFs ) , and like the K96Q mutant , it binds G but not F - actin and depolymerizes ﬁlaments ( Ono et al . , 1998 ) . Sequence alignments show that although UNC - 60A retains much of the pattern of homology in the loop region ( K - M - D - K - I - I - F ) , in the key pos - ition of lysine 96 , it contains a methionine residue ( Figure 1 ( a ) ) . A more distant relative is twinﬁlin : a highly conserved actin binding protein composed of tandem repeats of coﬁlin , each about 20 % iden - tical to coﬁlin ( Goode et al . , 1998 ; Lappalainen et al . , 1998 ) . Twinﬁlin shows strong homology in the region of the long helix , but not in the loop region ( Figure 1 ( a ) ) . Our results would lead us to predict that twinﬁlin will bind G but not F - actin , as has been shown ( Goode et al . , 1998 ) . Interestingly , despite the fact that the seven - residue homology between the villin headpiece and coﬁlin loop are located in unrelated structures ( Hatanaka et al . , 1996 ; Leonard et al . , 1997 ; McKnight et al . , 1997 ; Varder et al . , 1999 ) , the K96 residue we have high - lighted as the essential residue in coﬁlin loop is precisely that essential to villin headpiece ﬁlament binding ( Friederich et al . , 1992 ; Doering et al . , 1996 ) . Figure 8 . EM showing ﬁlament fragmentation by S3D . Electron micrographs showing control actin ﬁlaments ( upper panel ) and S3D fragmentation of actin ﬁlaments in low salt ( 20 mM ) 10 mM succinate ( pH 6 . 3 ) , F - buffer ( lower panel ) . Fragmentation by wt - coﬁlin is equivalent to S3D . Scale bar represents 300 nm . 656 Coﬁlin - Actin Twist and Subunit Turnover Mutants that bind the 1 - 2L site twist and fragment filaments without depolymerizing them A major distinction between the two mutants in our assays is that S3D binds F - actin at low ionic strength , giving rise to the twist change and frag - mentation similar to wt - coﬁlin , but the loop mutant shows none of these activities . Our results demonstrate that S3D binds F - actin only at low ionic strength and has weaker cooperativity as compared to wt - coﬁlin ( Figure 5 ) . Consistent with this , S3D weakly accelerated depolymerization but only under low ionic strength conditions ( Figure 7 ( a ) and ( c ) ) . The low level of activation ( ﬁvefold ) shown in Figure 7 ( c ) may be due to an increase in ﬁlament number from a low level of fragmentation ( Table 1 ) . It is probable that this depolymerization results in the release of com - plexes of actin / ADP with S3D , but since the afﬁ - nity of S3D for actin / ADP is low ( K d (cid:136) 0 . 76 m M in the absence of salt compared to 0 . 03 m M for wt - coﬁlin ) , these complexes readily dissociate at low concentration . This was conﬁrmed from FPLC analysis of supernatant fractions prepared from co - sedimentation experiments at pH 8 . Cofilin binds two actins along the filament Fitting the actin ( Holmes et al . , 1990 ; Lorenz et al . , 1993 ) and ADF coordinates ( Hatanaka et al . , 1996 ) into the EM reconstruction of coﬁlin on actin ( McGough et al . , 1997 ) ( Figure 1 ( b ) ) , it becomes apparent that coﬁlin’s binding site involves sub - domains 1 and 3 of the upper subunit and sub - domains 1 and 2 of the lower subunit . Filaments of actin undergo random thermal motions which may allow ADF / coﬁlin to bind in the ﬁrst place . From our results we propose that the initial interaction between coﬁlin and F - actin occurs through the loop site with 1 - 2L . The increase in twist would then be initiated either by a conformational change in the actin subunits or by displacement of the upper subunit around the ﬁlament . In either case , binding through this site facilitates additional interaction at the other end of coﬁlin to the 1 - 3U site of the neighboring subunit , thereby stabilizing ﬁlament binding in the changed twist state . Coop - erativity would be explained if these local pertur - bations in twist lead to additional coﬁlin binding at adjacent subunits . In S3D , ﬁlament binding occurs by a similar mechanism , but it is much weaker than wt - coﬁlin and observed only under low salt conditions . We conclude that the loop site in S3D is fully competent to bind F - actin and that the helix site has residual weak actin afﬁnity , possibly involving K114 salt - bridging to actin ( Wriggers et al . , 1998 ) . Although this weak residual activity is sufﬁcient to support ﬁlament binding when initiated through the loop site , based on the FPLC results , it is insufﬁcient to hold the com - plexes together once they have dissociated from ﬁlaments . The double mutation , S3D , K96Q con - ﬁrms the need for the loop site to effect ﬁlament binding . Twist change induces fragmentation but not depolymerization From measurements of ﬁlament lengths in elec - tron micrographs we have calculated an average of six or seven fragmentation events per ﬁlament by Figure 9 . Cryo - EM and diffraction patterns of decorated actin ﬁlaments . Electron micrographs and computed dif - fraction patterns of ( ( a ) and ( d ) ) F - actin , ( ( b ) and ( e ) ) F - actin (cid:135) wt - coﬁlin , and ( ( c ) and ( f ) ) F - actin (cid:135) S3D . S3D retains the ability to change ﬁlament twist when bound to F - actin under low salt concentrations . Arrowheads show positions of the ﬁrst layerlines in the diffraction patterns . These correspond to ﬁlament crossover lengths of 353 ( d ) , 267 ( e ) , and 265 A˚ ( f ) . Scale bar represents 500 A˚ . Coﬁlin - Actin Twist and Subunit Turnover 657 coﬁlin or ADF . This correlates well with the ﬁve - fold increase in polymerization rates observed fol - lowing the addition of human ADF to actin ﬁlaments in a ﬂuorescence assay to measure frag - mentation ( Maciver et al . , 1998 ) . This conclusion is also supported from recent experiments on actin mutants by Moriyama & Yahara ( 1999 ) , who esti - mated cutting every 290 subunits . Because in low salt concentrations , S3D gives a similar increase in twist and reduced ﬁlament length comparable to wt - coﬁlin , this suggests that the twist change is associated with fragmentation . The weak accelera - tion of subunit dissociation by S3D can be accounted for by increased ﬁlament number con - centration resulting from fragmentation . By con - trast , the loop mutant , which does not bind ﬁlaments or induce fragmentation , still accelerates the disassembly process , probably by destabilizing terminal subunits . It is clear that the fragmentation and depolymerization reﬂect differences in the interactions of coﬁlin with the two adjacent sub - units in the ﬁlaments . Materials and Methods Protein preparations The S3D mutant was made by PCR - based oligonucleo - tide mutagenesis of wt - human coﬁlin in the expression vector pMW172 ( McGough et al . , 1997 ) . Mutation of lysine residues 95 , 96 to glutamate ( K95Q , K96Q ) were made ( Chen & Przybyla , 1994 ) , which utilises the pro - ducts from a ﬁrst round of PCR based oligonucleotide directed mutagenesis as primers for a second . K96Q was similarly prepared and the double mutation of S3D , K96Q was constructed from an Nde I - Sal I fragment of S3D inserted into the similarly cleaved construct for K96Q . Full - length expression clones were fully sequenced to ensure ﬁdelity . Human ADF , coﬁlin and mutants were expressed and puriﬁed from the super - natants of Escherichia coli lysates ( Way et al . , 1992a ) . These supernatants were dialyzed against 10 mM Tris ( pH 8 . 0 ) , 0 . 5 mM DTT , 1 mM NaN 3 and 0 . 2 mM EGTA and applied to DEAE - cellulose ( 10 cm (cid:2) 2 . 5 cm ) in the same buffer ( Hawkins et al . , 1993 ) . Generally the ﬂow - through fractions gave single bands on gels and needed no further puriﬁcation . When required , further puriﬁ - cation was performed by adjusting the DEAE eluate to pH 6 . 6 with sodium succinate buffer before applying to CM - cellulose ( 10 cm (cid:2) 2 . 5 cm ) in 10 mM sodium succi - nate ( pH 6 . 6 ) , 0 . 5 mM DTT , 1 mM NaN 3 . The coﬁlin was then eluted with a salt gradient to 0 . 2 M NaCl . The puri - ﬁed proteins were dialyzed into 10 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 8 . 0 ) , 0 . 2 mM EGTA , 2 mM DTT , 1 mM NaN 3 , con - centrated by Centricon ultraﬁltration , drop frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at (cid:255) 70 (cid:14) C . Rabbit muscle actin was prepared as described ( Taylor & Weeds , 1976 ) . Actin was polymerized in F - buf - fer ( 100 mM NaCl , 10 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 8 . 0 ) , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 1 mM ATP , 0 . 2 mM EGTA , 0 . 2 mM DTT , 1 mM NaN 3 ) . Protein concentrations Protein concentrations were calculated from absor - bance measurements at 280 nm , based on the tyrosine and tryptophan content of each ( Gill & von Hippel , 1989 ) . Values for A 280 (cid:136) 1 . 0 cm (cid:255) 1 were coﬁlin wt and mutants (cid:136) 72 . 2 m M and ADF (cid:136) 85 . 0 . The actin concen - tration was determined using an A 290 (cid:136) 1 . 0 cm (cid:255) 1 (cid:136) 38 m M . Circular dichroism Far - UV CD measurements were made on a Jobin - Yvon Dichrograph CD6 using 300 m l of protein in the concentration range of 0 . 2 to 0 . 6 mg / ml in 5 mM sodium phosphate ( pH 6 . 0 ) , 1 mM NaN 3 , 0 . 2 mM DTT , 50 mM NaCl at 20 (cid:14) C in a 0 . 5 mm light path ( Pope et al . , 1997 ) . Co - sedimentation assays ADF / coﬁlin proteins were ﬁrst clariﬁed by centrifu - gation at 100 , 000 rpm ( 390 , 000 g ) in a Beckman TLA100 ultracentrifuge for 20 minutes at 4 (cid:14) C . F - actin at 5 - 10 m M in F - buffer was mixed with protein and buffer to a ﬁnal volume of 100 m l . After mixing , samples were left for 20 minutes at 20 (cid:14) C before pelleting at 70 , 000 rpm ( 190 , 000 g ) for 20 minutes at 4 (cid:14) C . Supernatants and pellets were analyzed by SDS - PAGE as described ( Pope et al . , 1994 ) . Filament binding was also monitored from quenching of PI - actin ﬂuorescence ( Maciver et al . , 1998 ; Blanchoin et al . , 1999 ) . Unlike the depolymerization assays , in which we used gelsolin - capped ﬁlaments dosed with 10 % PI - actin , 5 m M neat pyrene G - actin was polymer - ized in 10 mM bis Tris ( pH 6 . 5 ) , 20 mM NaCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM EGTA , 0 . 1 mM ATP , 1 mM NaN 3 . Coﬁ - lin or K95Q , K96Q was added at ratios up to 1 . 2 mol per mol of actin and the ﬂuorescence signal monitored before and after mixing . Depolymerization assays The depolymerizing activity of coﬁlin and mutants was determined using PI - actin ﬂuorescence as described ( Hawkins et al . , 1993 ) . Gelsolin - capped PI - actin ﬁlaments were prepared from 5 m M actin ( containing 10 % PI - actin , Molecular Probes ) polymerized in the presence of 25 nM gelsolin and diluted to 200 nM in G 0 - buffer ( 10 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 8 . 0 ) , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 1 mM NaN 3 , 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 , 2 mM DTT ) . The initial rate of depoly - merization was measured from the rate of ﬂuorescence decrease using excitation and emission wavelengths of 366 and 384 nm , respectively . Coﬁlin was added after approximately 30 seconds and the rate constant for depolymerization determined by non - linear least - squares ﬁtting of the exponential decrease in ﬂuorescence . The rate of actin depolymerization or treadmilling was also measured from the turnover of actin - bound nucleotide using actin containing etheno - ATP ( e - ATP ; Molecular Probes ) ( Carlier et al . , 1997 ) . Actin / e - ATP was prepared from G - actin in G - buffer ( 2 . 5 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 8 . 0 ) , 0 . 1 mM ATP , 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 , 2 mM dithiothrei - tol and 1 mM NaN 3 ) as described ( Hawkins et al . , 1993 ) . Gelsolin - capped ﬁlaments were prepared by mixing gel - solin 1 : 200 with 5 m M actin / e - ATP and polymerizing with 1 mM Mg and 10 mM - 100 mM NaCl . Nucleotide exchange was monitored by ﬂuorescence , following addition of 1 mM ATP to 4 m M capped ﬁlaments in the presence of various concentrations of coﬁlin or mutants , using a Perkin - Elmer LS - 50B spectroﬂuorimeter with excitation and emission wavelengths of 360 and 412 nm , respectively . Rate constants were calculated from the exponential traces using non - linear least - squares ﬁtting . 658 Coﬁlin - Actin Twist and Subunit Turnover Since the ﬂuorescence of e - ATP is elevated when it binds either to G - actin or F - actin ( Hawkins et al . , 1993 ) , the reduction in ﬂuorescence occurs only after actin subunits have dissociated from either ﬁlament ends or from com - plexes with coﬁlin . Although the nucleotide exchange assays do not measure the dissociation process directly , the treadmilling rate is limited by subunit dissociation under steady - state conditions ( Brenner & Korn 1983 ) . G - actin binding G - actin binding was measured using e - ATP exchange ( Maciver et al . , 1998 ) , using actin / ADP prepared as fol - lows ( essentially after Pollard ( 1984 ) ) : G - actin in 2 . 5 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 8 . 0 ) , 0 . 1 mM ATP , 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 , 2 mM dithiothreitol and 1 mM NaN 3 was stripped of excess ATP by addition of a 20 % volume of a 50 % slurry of Dowex 1 (cid:2) 8 ( Hawkins et al . , 1993 ) . Following addition of 0 . 2 mM ADP , the remaining ATP was converted to ADP by addition of 2 units / ml of hexokinase - agarose plus 0 . 1 mM glucose , and the mixture was incubated for at least two hours on ice with occasional vortexing . The hexokinase resin was removed by centrifugation and actin / ADP used within a few hours of preparation . In order to minimize the level of contaminating ATP in commercially available ADP , we used ADP from Boeh - ringer Mannheim , because using the luciferase assay , this was found to contain only 0 . 07 % ATP contami - nation , less than 10 % that measured in other prep - arations . Assays were carried out using 0 . 5 m M actin / ADP , well below the critical concentration , with 0 . 1 mM e - ATP to ensure complete exchange . The rate of exchange was monitored by ﬂuorescence as described above . Analysis of complexes by FPLC Complexes of coﬁlin / G - actin were prepared by incu - bation of 40 m M F - actin with 48 m M K95Q , K96Q , 80 m M coﬁlin or 128 m M S3D in 10 mM Tris ( pH 8 . 0 ) , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 20 mM NaCl , 0 . 1 mM ATP , 0 . 2 mM EGTA , 0 . 2 mM DTT and 1 mM NaN 3 at room temperature for one hour . Samples were then clariﬁed at 250 , 000 g before analyzing on a Pharmacia FPLC Superdex 75 column in the same buffer containing 20 mM to 150 mM salt . Electron microscopy assays for fragmentation G - actin was polymerized at 2 m M in F - buffer with 10 mM succinate at pH 6 . 3 . ADF or coﬁlin was incu - bated with F - actin at different ratios and left for between 30 seconds and 30 minutes on ice , or polymerized with G - actin overnight at 4 (cid:14) C before ﬁxing on grids . Controls , using the same volume of buffer as ADF or coﬁlin or using an F - actin binding segment from gelsolin ( G2 - 3 ) , were run in parallel to assess fragmentation due to shearing . Capped ﬁlaments were prepared by gelsolin nucleation ( 1 : 100 ) of 2 . 5 m M G - actin and polymerizing the mixture for ten minutes under F - buffer conditions . Aliquots of 30 m l were applied to 400 mesh carbon - coated grids using a cut yellow tip to avoid shearing , left for 30 seconds , washed with ﬁve drops of F - buffer and stained with 1 % ( w / v ) uranyl acetate . Micrographs were taken at a magniﬁcation of 10 , 000 to 25 , 000 using a Philips 308S electron microscope at 80 kV . Measurements were made for all ﬁlaments present from the center of the ﬁeld of an image to avoid subjective selectivity , col - lecting values for 50 coﬁlin - treated samples . Filament twist measurements Measurements of crossover lengths , which are an indi - cation of the ﬁlament twist , were performed by electron cryomicroscopy and Fourier analysis ( McGough et al . , 1997 ) . Pre - formed actin ﬁlaments ( 2 . 6 m M ) were incu - bated at room temperature for (cid:24) 30 minutes with a 3 . 5 molar excess of S3D in 15 mM Mes ( pH 6 . 0 ) , 10 mM NaCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM DTT and 0 . 2 mM ATP . Deco - rated ﬁlaments were rapidly frozen in ethane slush cooled with liquid nitrogen then imaged using a JEOL 1200EX transmission electron cryomicroscope . Micro - graphs were recorded at an accelerating voltage of 100 kV and a nominal magniﬁcation of 30 , 000 (cid:2) . Suitable micrographs were digitised using a Zeiss SCAI ﬁlm scanner at a ﬁnal resolution of 4 . 66 A˚ per pixel . Filament images were analyzed using the helical image processing package PHOELIX ( Whitaker et al . , 1995 ) . Mean cross - over lengths were measured from positions of the ﬁrst layerline in computed diffraction patterns of computa - tionally straightened ﬁlaments . Acknowledgments A .
