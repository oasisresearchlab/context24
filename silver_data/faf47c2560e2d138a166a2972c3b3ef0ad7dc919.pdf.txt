Results : Loss of AGS3 expression results in defective leukocyte chemotaxis , calcium mobilization , and ERK1 / 2 and Akt activation . Conclusion : AGS3 is required for efficient chemokine receptor signal integration . Significance : These studies extend the functional repertoire for AGS3 in the immune system , providing unexpected regulatory mechanisms for immune function . Activator of G - protein signaling 3 ( AGS3 , gene name G - pro - tein signaling modulator - 1 , Gpsm1 ) , an accessory protein for G - protein signaling , has functional roles in the kidney and CNS . Here we show that AGS3 is expressed in spleen , thymus , and bone marrow - derived dendritic cells , and is up - regulated upon leukocyte activation . We explored the role of AGS3 in immune cell function by characterizing chemokine receptor signaling in leukocytes from mice lacking AGS3 . No obvious differences in lymphocyte subsets were observed . Interestingly , however , AGS3 - null B and T lymphocytes and bone marrow - derived den - dritic cells exhibited significant chemotactic defects as well as reductions in chemokine - stimulated calcium mobilization and altered ERK and Akt activation . These studies indicate a role for AGS3 in the regulation of G - protein signaling in the immune system , providing unexpected venues for the potential develop - ment of therapeutic agents that modulate immune function by targeting these regulatory mechanisms . Integration of signals emanating from chemokine receptors represents one of the most commonly used mechanisms for leukocyte distribution and recruitment to lymphoid organs and the periphery . Such signal integration involves not only the reg - ulated expression of individual chemokine receptors and the stoichiometries of the core signaling triad of receptor , hetero - trimeric G - protein , and effectors but also cell type - specific accessory proteins that modulate signals across this core signal - ing system . Such accessory proteins bestow upon leukocytes and other cells the ability to tightly control signaling pathways to maximize signal efficiency , strength , and duration while at the same time providing flexibility to quickly adapt to changes in environmental stimuli ( 1 , 2 ) . Perturbations of heterotrimeric G - protein signal input or duration result in defective leukocyte development , trafficking , motility , and overall chemokine responsiveness ( 3 – 9 ) . In addi - tion , accessory proteins at the GPCR 2 - G - protein interface also play key roles in regulating leukocyte function by modulating G - protein activity and responsiveness to chemokines . Many regulators of G - protein signaling ( RGS ) proteins are expressed in leukocytes ( 1 , 10 ) and play important functions in regulating chemokine responsiveness . For example , RGS1 plays an impor - tant role in modulating lymphocyte motility and trafficking ( 4 ) . RGS1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) lymphocytes move more rapidly in response to chemokines , suggesting that modulating the duration of G (cid:2) i activation in response to chemokines plays an important role in leukocyte activation and trafficking ( 4 ) . Additional mecha - nisms for modulation of G (cid:2) i activity are also likely important for spatio - temporal regulation of leukocyte responsiveness and for integration of signals from multiple chemokines at any given time . Another group of accessory proteins , the activators of G - pro - tein signaling ( AGS ) proteins , were identified in a yeast - based functional screen for receptor - independent activators of het - erotrimeric G - proteins ( 11 , 12 ) and can be broadly categorized into three groups based on their input into the G - protein acti - vation / deactivation cycle ( 13 ) . Group II AGS proteins are char - acterized by the presence of up to four G - protein regulatory * The research presented in this article was supported in part by the Flow Cytometry and Cell Sorting Shared Resource , funded by a Cancer Center Support grant P30 CA138313 to the Hollings Cancer Center at the Medical UniversityofSouthCarolinaandinpartbytheNationalCenterforResearchResourcesandtheOfficeoftheDirectoroftheNationalInstitutesofHealththroughgrantnumberC06RR015455andS10RR027777 .

GPR motif - containing proteins thus provide a novel mode of signal input to heterotrimeric G - proteins that may operate distinct from the superfamily of GPCRs and may also function as binding partners for G (cid:2) i subunits independent of heterotrimer formation . These theories have broad implica - tions for signal processing and provide a mechanism for unex - pected functions of G - proteins as signal transducers within the cell . A member of the Group II AGS proteins , AGS3 ( gene name , G - protein signaling modulator - 1 ( Gpsm1 ) ) 3 contains seven tet - ratricopeptide repeats , which are involved in protein - protein interactions and four G - protein regulatory ( GPR ) / GoLoco motifs , allowing AGS3 to simultaneously bind up to four G (cid:2) i - GDP subunits free of G (cid:3)(cid:4) . Previous data suggest functional roles for AGS3 in such diverse processes as neuronal plasticity and addiction , autophagy , membrane protein trafficking , poly - cystic kidney disease , cardiovascular regulation , and metabo - lism ( 18 – 28 ) . As part of an expanded approach to more fully understanding the in vivo role of AGS3 in G - protein signal processing , we previously reported the generation of a condi - tional AGS3 - null mouse strain , which is a valuable model to dissect physiological functions of AGS3 ( 18 , 23 , 26 ) . Our goal in this study was to define the functional role of AGS3 in leukocytes , beginning with its role in chemokine receptor signal integration . Our data suggest that AGS3 assists in the integration of signals from the receptor to the chemotac - tic machinery , including calcium mobilization , ERK1 / 2 and Akt phosphorylation , and leukocyte motility . These data indicate key roles for AGS3 in the integration of chemokine receptor signaling and expand the functional repertoire of accessory proteins in the immune system . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Materials —Recombinant mouse GM - CSF , CXCL12 , and CCL19 were purchased from BioAbChem Inc . ( Ladson , SC ) . AGS3 - antisera generated by immunization of rabbits with a GST - AGS3 fusion protein encoding the GPR domain ( Ala 461 – Ser 650 ) of AGS3 was kindly provided by Dr . Dzwokai Ma ( Uni - versity of California , Santa Barbara , CA ) . G (cid:2) i1 / 2 and G (cid:2) i3 anti - sera were kindly provided by Dr . Thomas Gettys ( Pennington Biomedical Research Center , Baton Rouge , LA ) . Protease inhib - itor cocktail tablets ( Complete Mini ) were obtained from Roche Applied Science . Gallein was obtained from Tocris ( Bristol , UK ) . Other materials were obtained as described elsewhere ( 29 , 30 ) . Mice —Generation of Gpsm1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) mice 3 used in this study was previously described ( 18 ) . Wild - type and Gpsm1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) female lit - termates at 6 – 12 weeks of age from Gpsm1 (cid:3) / (cid:2) intercrosses were used . Gpsm1 (cid:3) / (cid:2) breeding pairs were generated from backcrosses onto C57BL / 6J mice for more than 12 generations . Tissues and lysates were prepared and processed for immuno - blotting as described ( 31 ) . Flow Cytometry and Cell Sorting —Single - cell suspensions from spleen and thymus were prepared from female mice ( Gpsm1 (cid:3) / (cid:3) and Gpsm1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) littermates ) at 6 weeks of age by crushing freshly dissected tissues between frosted glass slides in PBS . After lysing red blood cells with ammonium - chloride - po - tassium ( ACK ) lysis buffer ( 170 m M NH 4 Cl , 170 m M Tris ) , cells were counted and washed with PBS with 1 % BSA and 0 . 05 % NaN 3 ( PBS - BSA ) . A total of 10 6 cells were first incubated with anti - Fc (cid:4) III ( CD16 / CD32 ) for 30 min at 4 °C to block Fc recep - tors , and then cells were incubated with primary FITC or phy - coerythrin - conjugated antibodies in PBS - BSA for 30 min at 4 °C ( BD Pharmingen ) . Cells were washed twice in PBS - BSA , resuspended in 500 (cid:5) l of PBS - BSA , and analyzed on a flow cytometer ( BD Pharmingen ) . CD4 and CD8 mAbs were used to characterize thymus cell subsets . The following mAbs were used to characterize spleen cell subsets : total B cells ( B220 (cid:3) , CD3 (cid:2) ) ; follicular B cells ( B220 (cid:3) , CD21 intermediate (cid:3) , CD23 (cid:3) ) ; marginal zone B cells ( B220 (cid:3) , CD21 high (cid:3) , CD23 (cid:2) ) ; double pos - itive T cells ( CD4 (cid:3) , CD8 (cid:3) ) ; and double negative T cells ( CD4 (cid:2) , CD8 (cid:2) ) . Primary Cells —Bone marrow cells from WT or Gpsm1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) mouse femurs and tibiae were filtered through a 40 - (cid:5) m nylon cell strainer , red blood cells were lysed with ammonium - chlo - ride - potassium lysis buffer , and cells were resuspended in DC media ( RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10 % FBS , 100 units / ml penicillin , 100 mg / ml streptomycin , and 20 ng / ml recombinant mouse GM - CSF ) and plated 4 – 5 (cid:4) 10 5 cells / ml in a 100 - mm tissue culture dish . On day 4 , 10 ml of fresh DC media was added to each dish . On day 8 , nonadherent and loosely adher - ent cells were harvested , washed , and replated in fresh DC medium containing 10 ng / ml recombinant mouse GM - CSF to generate immature dendritic cells ( iDC ) . On day 9 , cells were treated with or without 200 ng / ml LPS for the indicated times or for 24 h to generate mature dendritic cells ( mDC ) . Spleens of WT or Gpsm1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) mice were gently crushed between frosted glass slides in serum - free RPMI . Red blood cells were lysed with ammonium - chloride - potassium lysis buffer , and splenocytes were washed in PBS ( Ca 2 (cid:3) - , Mg 2 (cid:3) - free ) supplemented with 0 . 1 % BSA and 2 m M EDTA and then resuspended at 5 (cid:4) 10 7 cells / ml or 1 (cid:4) 10 8 cells / ml for subsequent B cell or T cell isolation , respectively . Cell isolation was performed according to Invitrogen Dynabeads protocol for untouched B cell isola - tion or negative T cell isolation . Chemotaxis —Corning Transwell 24 - well inserts ( 6 . 5 - mm diameter , 5 . 0 - (cid:5) m pore size ) or 96 - well inserts ( 5 . 0 - (cid:5) m pore size ) were used for all chemotaxis assays . For dendritic cell che - motaxis , serum - free RPMI with or without 250 ng / ml CXCL12 or CCL19 was added to the lower chamber , and (cid:5) 3 (cid:4) 10 6 cells / ml were loaded into the upper chamber . Where indicated , dendritic cells were preincubated with 10 (cid:5) M gallein ( final con - centration ) or vehicle ( 0 . 02 % DMSO final concentration ) in serum - free RPMI for 30 min at 37 °C prior to measuring che - motaxis . In these cases , 10 (cid:5) M gallein ( final concentration ) and vehicle ( 0 . 02 % DMSO final concentration ) were included in both upper and lower chambers as described previously ( 32 ) . 3 In2004 , theHumanGenomeOrganization ( HUGO ) committeeclassifiedthe gene names for multiple GPR motif - containing proteins with the designa - tion “G - protein signaling modulator ( Gpsm ) 1 – 4 . ” Therefore , by conven - tion , the gene name for AGS3 is Gpsm1 , and thus it is more appropriate to refer to the genotype of AGS3 - null mice as Gpsm1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) . We refer to the protein encoded by the Gpsm1 gene as AGS3 .

Chemotaxis chambers were incubated at 37 °C , 5 % CO 2 for 20 h for den - dritic cells and 5 h for lymphocytes . The upper chamber was then removed , and cells migrating to the lower chamber were counted . The percentage of cells migrating to chemokine was determined by subtracting the average cells migrating to vehi - cle alone and then comparing with the actual number of input cells . Determination of Intracellular Calcium Levels —Freshly har - vested splenocytes of WT and Gpsm1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) mice were seeded into clear bottom , black - walled 96 - well plates at 1 (cid:4) 10 6 cells / well in 100 (cid:5) l of serum - free , phenol red - free RPMI , and cells were serum - starved for at least 1 h . Cells were incubated in the Calcium 5 assay kit dye for 1 h at 37 °C , and then the plate was allowed to come to room temperature for 15 min prior to anal - ysis . CXCL12 or CCL19 was added at a final concentration of 200 ng / ml by the FLIPRtetra instrument , and measurements were taken every second for at least 300 s . Bone marrow cells were harvested from WT and Gpsm1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) female mice between 6 and 10 weeks of age and cultured to dendritic cells as described above . DCs were seeded at 2 . 5 (cid:4) 10 5 cells / well and serum - starved for (cid:5) 1 h followed by incubation in the calcium dye for 1 h . CXCL12 was added at a final concentration of 200 ng / ml by the FLIPRtetra , and measurements , reported as rela - tive light units , were taken every second for at least 300 s . Neg - ative control and response over baseline corrections were applied using the ScreenWorks 3 . 1 software . Immunoblotting —Single - cell suspensions from spleen and thymus were prepared by crushing freshly dissected tissues between frosted glass slides in PBS . After lysing red blood cells with ice - cold 0 . 17 M NH 4 Cl , 0 . 17 M Tris for 5 min at room temperature followed by centrifugation at 500 (cid:4) g for 5 min at room temperature , cells were pelleted and resuspended in 1 % Nonidet P - 40 lysis buffer ( 50 m M Tris , pH 8 . 0 , 150 m M NaCl , 5 m M EDTA , 1 % Nonidet P - 40 ) on ice for 20 min followed by centrifugation at 10 , 000 (cid:4) g for 30 min at 4 °C . Protein concen - tration was determined by a Pierce BCA protein assay . Protein samples were loaded on denaturing 10 % polyacrylamide gels and then were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride mem - branes for immunoblotting as described ( 31 ) . Cell pellets pro - cessed for phosphorylated proteins were lysed in 1 % Nonidet P - 40 buffer with protease and phosphatase inhibitors ( 50 m M NaF , 5 m M sodium pyrophosphate , 40 m M (cid:3) - glycerophosphate , and 200 (cid:5) M Na 3 VO 4 ) on ice for 20 min followed by centrifuga - tion at 10 , 000 (cid:4) g for 30 min at 4 °C . Samples were subjected to SDS - PAGE , and proteins were transferred to PVDF mem - branes and immunoblotted for anti - phospho - Akt ( Ser 483 ) ( Life Technologies ) , anti - phospho - ERK ( Tyr 402 ) ( Santa Cruz Bio - technology , Dallas , TX ) , or total ERK ( Abcam , Cambridge , MA ) and total Akt ( Cell Signaling Technology , Boston , MA ) anti - bodies . Densitometric quantification of the immunoblotted bands was performed using ImageJ densitometry software ( Version 1 . 46r , National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , MD ) . Selected bands were quantified based on their relative intensi - ties and normalized to total ERK or total Akt . RESULTS Increasing evidence indicates a growing number of cellular and physiological roles for accessory proteins such as AGS3 and other proteins containing the GPR motif in dynamic signaling systems such as the central nervous system ( CNS ) where signal modulation and adaptation of G - protein signaling systems are key to the responsiveness of the system ( 19 – 21 , 28 , 33 ) . The dynamic processing of signals in the immune system also involves highly specialized , spatially integrated , G - protein sig - naling mechanisms ( 1 , 34 ) . As an initial approach to define the role of GPR proteins in such modes of signal integration , we studied the role of the GPR protein AGS3 in chemotactic sig - naling in immune cells . Analysis of Protein Expression and Leukocyte Populations from AGS3 / Gpsm1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) Mice —To explore potential functional roles for AGS3 in leukocytes , we took advantage of a recently developed AGS3 / Gpsm1 - null mouse model ( 18 ) . 3 AGS3 ( M r (cid:5) 74 , 000 ) was abundant in cells isolated from the thymus and spleen of wild - type mice , but as expected , was completely absent from the same tissues in Gpsm1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) mice ( Fig . 1 ) . Immu - noblot analysis revealed no obvious compensatory alterations in expression of the AGS3 / Gpsm1 - related protein LGN / FIGURE 1 . Immunoblot of WT and Gpsm1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) mouse thymocyte and splenocyte lysates . Thymocytes and splenocytes were isolated following red blood cell lysis and filtering to remove cell and tissue aggregates as described under “Experimental Procedures . ” Lysates were prepared with 1 % Nonidet P - 40 lysis buffer and subjected to SDS - PAGE ( 100 (cid:5) g / lane ) and immunoblotting with AGS3 , LGN , G (cid:2) i2 , G (cid:2) i3 , and actin - specific antisera as described under “Experimental Procedures . ” AGS3 Regulation of Leukocyte Chemotaxis 10740 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY VOLUME 289•NUMBER 15• APRIL 11 , 2014 a t DA L HOU S I E UN I V on J u l y 9 , 2014 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m Gpsm2 . Expression analysis of G (cid:2) i2 and G (cid:2) i3 subunits , which are the predominantly expressed G (cid:2) i subunits in hematopoi - etic cells ( 35 – 37 ) , indicated that G (cid:2) i2 and G (cid:2) i3 expression was largely unaffected with a modest increase in expression of G (cid:2) i2 in Gpsm1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) splenocytes and thymocytes ( Fig . 1 ) . AGS3 and other proteins with the GPR motif together with G (cid:2) i and G (cid:3)(cid:4) play key roles in asymmetric cell division of many types of stem and progenitor cells , thus influencing cell fate decisions ( 38 , 39 ) . In addition , defects in G (cid:2) i signaling result in aberrant lymphocyte differentiation ( 7 , 35 , 40 ) . We therefore hypothesized that loss of AGS3 may result in defective lympho - cyte differentiation . However , analysis of lymphocyte subsets from spleens and thymi of naive Gpsm1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) mice indicated no statistically significant differences in the relative distribution of B and T cell and other leukocyte subsets as compared with wild - type mice ( Table 1 ) . Leukocyte Stimulation Enhances AGS3 Protein Levels —As we observed no obvious defects in lymphocyte subset differen - tiation , we next explored whether AGS3 levels were affected by stimulation of leukocytes . Indeed , dramatic up - regulation of AGS3 expression was observed in primary B cells stimulated with either LPS or IgM and primary T cells stimulated with anti - CD3 and interleukin ( IL ) - 2 ( Fig . 2 A ) . In addition , AGS3 levels were also markedly increased over time in primary bone marrow - derived dendritic cells ( BMDCs ) after treatment with LPS ( Fig . 2 B ) . Up - regulation of AGS3 upon immune cell acti - vation suggests a role for AGS3 in regulating immune respons - es ; furthermore , these results indicate that AGS3 levels are responsive to changes in the cellular environment , which is consistent with previous reports of regulation of AGS3 expres - sion by cell stress and maladaptation ( 19 – 21 , 23 , 24 , 26 ) . Defective Chemotaxis in AGS3 / Gpsm1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) Leukocytes —G (cid:2) i signal integration is a critical component of chemokine signal - ing ( e . g . ( 41 ) . We therefore sought to determine the effect of the loss of AGS3 on chemokine - directed signaling events . As an initial approach to address this question , we analyzed the che - motactic responses of leukocytes isolated from WT and Gpsm1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) mice . B and T lymphocytes isolated from Gpsm1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) mice showed nearly a 50 % reduction in chemotaxis toward either CXCL12 / SDF - 1 (cid:2) or CCL19 as compared with WT lym - phocytes ( Fig . 3 , A and B ) . Similarly , BMDCs from AGS3 - null mice showed (cid:5) 30 % reduction in migration toward the chemo - kine CXCL12 ( Fig . 3 C , left panel ) . There was no significant difference in random migration between WT and Gpsm1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) lymphocytes or BMDCs , 4 suggesting that the chemotactic defect in Gpsm1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) cells was not due to an overall decrease in cell motility . Chemokine receptor expression levels were not altered in Gpsm1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) BMDCs or lymphocytes as compared with WT cells as determined by flow cytometry , indicating that the chemotactic defect in Gpsm1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) leukocytes was not due to loss of chemokine receptor expression . 4 Treatment of BMDCs with inflammatory signals such as LPS induces differentiation from iDCs into mDCs . Chemokine receptor expression levels and subsequent chemokine respon - siveness in DCs are very sensitive to this maturation process , 4 M . Branham - O’Connor , W . G . Robichaux , III , and J . B .

As shown in Fig . 3 C , our results for WT BMDC chemotaxis before and after maturation ( iDC and mDC , respectively ) are consistent with previously published observations ( 44 – 46 ) in that iDCs preferentially responded to CXCL12 ( Fig . 3 C , left panel ) and mDCs preferentially responded to CCL19 ( Fig . 3 C , right panel ) . One would predict that if AGS3 is up - regulated upon LPS treatment ( Fig . 2 ) and if AGS3 plays a positive role in inte - grating chemokine signals , then the chemotactic defect in DCs from Gpsm1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) mice would be greater for mDCs as compared with iDCs . As expected , Gpsm1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) iDCs exhib - ited an (cid:5) 25 % decrease in chemotaxis to CXCL12 ( Fig . 3 C , left panel ) ; however , Gpsm1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) mDCs showed an (cid:5) 40 % decrease in chemotaxis to CCL19 as compared with WT mDCs ( Fig . 3 C , right panel ) . These data are consistent with the hypothesis that chemokine signal integration is sensitive to AGS3 levels and that AGS3 plays a positive role in chemo - kine signal processing . A possible explanation for AGS3 function in chemokine sig - nal integration is that by binding G (cid:2) i subunits prior to refor - mation of G (cid:2) i (cid:3)(cid:4) heterotrimer , AGS3 could enhance or prolong G (cid:3)(cid:4) signaling . As an initial approach to address this question , we treated WT and Gpsm1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) dendritic cells with gallein , a G (cid:3)(cid:4) inhibitor . Although the chemotactic response to chemo - kine was reduced in Gpsm1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) dendritic cells , the magnitude of inhibition of chemokine - induced chemotaxis by the G (cid:3)(cid:4) antagonist gallein was similar in both WT and Gpsm1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) den - dritic cells ( Fig . 3 D ) . These data suggest that the reduced che - motaxis observed in Gpsm1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) cells may result from the loss of a positive modulatory role of AGS3 on G (cid:3)(cid:4) signaling . Impaired Chemokine - mediated Signal Processing in AGS3 / Gpsm1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) Leukocytes —To further define the effects of loss of AGS3 on chemokine signaling , we investigated chemokine - in - duced mobilization of intracellular calcium in WT and Gpsm1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) leukocytes ( Fig . 4 ) . An increase in intracellular cal - cium plays a critical role in cell motility and chemotaxis ( 48 , 49 ) . FIGURE 3 .

AGS3 Regulation of Leukocyte Chemotaxis 10742 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY VOLUME 289•NUMBER 15• APRIL 11 , 2014 a t DA L HOU S I E UN I V on J u l y 9 , 2014 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m Indeed , Gpsm1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) splenocytes and BMDCs showed dimin - ished chemokine - induced calcium responses ( Fig . 4 ) , consis - tent with the chemotactic defect in Gpsm1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) cells as com - pared with WT cells . In addition to calcium mobilization , phosphorylation of ERK1 / 2 and Akt is also attributed to chemokine signaling . Stimulation of chemokine receptors such as CXCR4 activates the kinase ERK1 / 2 by stimulating its phosphorylation ( 50 ) , which in turn is an important regulator of cell motility in many cell types including lymphocytes and dendritic cells ( 41 , 51 ) . Interestingly , Gpsm1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) BMDCs showed significant impair - ment of CXCL12 - stimulated phosphorylation of ERK1 / 2 as well as Akt ( Fig . 5 ) . In addition , pretreatment with pertussis toxin blocked CXCL12 - induced ERK1 / 2 and Akt phosphoryla - tion in BMDCs from both WT and Gpsm1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) mice to the same extent ( Fig . 5 ) . GM - CSF - stimulated ERK1 / 2 phosphorylation , acting through a tyrosine kinase receptor pathway , was not affected by the loss of AGS3 expression in Gpsm1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) BMDCs . 4 Splenocytes from Gpsm1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) mice also showed significant defects in both CXCL12 - stimulated and CCL19 - stimulated ERK1 / 2 and Akt phosphorylation ( Fig . 6 ) . DISCUSSION Accessory proteins for G - protein signaling systems have revealed surprising diversity in modes of heterotrimeric G - pro - tein signal integration , including but not limited to the modu - lation of signal strength , duration , location , termination , and the formation of signal transduction complexes ( for review , see Refs . 2 , 13 , 16 , and 17 ) . Although functional roles for the acces - sory protein AGS3 have been described in asymmetric cell divi - sion , neuronal plasticity and addiction , autophagy , polycystic kidney disease and renal injury , cardiovascular regulation , and metabolism ( 18 – 28 , 33 ) , the data described in this study are the first to demonstrate a role for AGS3 in the regulation of chemo - kine responses in hematopoietic cells . Indeed , there are relatively few reports of GPCR signal modulation by GPR motif - containing proteins ( 21 , 28 , 52 – 56 ) , underscoring the significance of the current study , which , in contrast to the pre - vious studies , makes use of primary cells obtained from genetic null ( Gpsm1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) ) 3 mice . In this study we demonstrate that the loss of AGS3 expres - sion results in aberrant chemokine - directed cell motility , Ca 2 (cid:3) flux , and ERK and Akt activation . These data suggest expanding functional roles for accessory proteins that , like AGS3 , contain the GPR motif in the integration of chemokine receptor signals . As compared with the dramatic defects in chemokine respon - siveness in G (cid:2) i2 - null mice ( 3 – 9 ) , the (cid:5) 30 – 40 % reduction in agonist - induced chemotaxis rather than a complete loss of che - motaxis in Gpsm1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) leukocytes is consistent with its effect as a modulatory protein . With respect to the role of AGS3 in chemokine receptor signal integration , three distinct hypothe - ses present themselves : 1 ) the chemokine receptor couples to the AGS3 - G (cid:2) i complex in a manner analogous to G (cid:2) i (cid:3)(cid:4) het - erotrimer and releases G (cid:2) i - GTP to modulate the chemotactic response ; 2 ) the G (cid:2) i - AGS3 module itself initiates the formation of an additional , noncanonical signaling complex distinct from G (cid:3)(cid:4) that modulates chemokine - directed signaling events ; and / or 3 ) by virtue of its GPR motifs , AGS3 influences G (cid:2) i and G (cid:3)(cid:4) subunit interactions to prolong or enhance G (cid:3)(cid:4) signaling to facilitate directed migration . In the first hypothesis , the chemokine receptor couples to the G (cid:2) i - AGS3 complex ( 29 ) to integrate downstream signaling events involving both G (cid:2) i and G (cid:3)(cid:4) . In heterologous systems , the G (cid:2) i - AGS3 module appears to directly engage with and is regulated by G (cid:2) i - coupled GPCRs ( 29 ) including CXCR4 . 5 It is not immediately clear how such a signaling system may directly impact GPCR - initiated G - protein signaling events ; however , studies of G (cid:2) i subunit selectivity for chemokine - induced responses ( 5 , 35 , 57 , 58 ) may suggest that G (cid:2) i subunits ( partic - ularly G (cid:2) i2 ) do have a direct impact on chemokine signaling in addition to regulating G (cid:3)(cid:4) , and thus the AGS3 - G (cid:2) i module may be operative within this context . 5 W .

AGS3 Regulation of Leukocyte Chemotaxis 10744 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY VOLUME 289•NUMBER 15• APRIL 11 , 2014 a t DA L HOU S I E UN I V on J u l y 9 , 2014 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m The second hypothesis is that the AGS3 - G (cid:2) i - GDP complex generated subsequent to receptor activation by AGS3 binding to G (cid:2) i - GDP prior to reassociation with G (cid:3)(cid:4) acts in the context of a novel , noncanonical signaling complex that integrates with G (cid:3)(cid:4) - regulated events to influence chemotaxis . Interestingly , a recent study suggests that the G (cid:2) i - AGS3 module acting through the AGS3 binding protein mammalian inscuteable ( mInsc ) and the Par3 - atypical PKC ( aPKC ) complex is involved in regulating directed migration of neutrophils ( 57 ) . These observations would suggest that G (cid:2) i - GDP bound to GPR motif ( s ) would either function as an active signaling entity ( 38 ) or serve as a platform for additional signal input as proposed previously ( 16 ) . However , cellular responses to chemokine receptor activa - tion are generally thought to be predominantly due to the actions of G (cid:3)(cid:4) subunits , stemming from original observations by Neptune and Bourne ( 59 ) , Charo and co - workers ( 60 ) , and in Dictyostelium ( 61 ) . G (cid:3)(cid:4) - mediated stimulation of PI3K (cid:4) ( 62 , 63 ) , phospholipase C (cid:3) ( PLC (cid:3) ) ( 64 ) , ERK1 / 2 ( 65 , 66 ) , and exchange factors for small GTPases Rac and Cdc42 ( 67 , 68 ) ( reviewed in Ref . 69 ) as well as other scaffolding proteins ( 70 ) appears to underlie the requirement of G (cid:3)(cid:4) for regulating che - moattractant - directed cell motility . More recently , small mol - ecule inhibitors of G (cid:3)(cid:4) further implicate a role for G (cid:3)(cid:4) in mediating chemokine responses in multiple cell types ( 32 , 71 ) ( Fig . 3 D ) . Within this context , the third hypothesis is that AGS3 may influence interactions between G (cid:2) i and G (cid:3)(cid:4) subunits and thus impart a positive modulatory effect on cellular responses to chemokines . As AGS3 GPR motifs compete with G (cid:3)(cid:4) for G (cid:2) i binding ( 12 , 29 , 72 , 73 ) , one possibility is that AGS3 may “grab” free G (cid:2) i - GDP prior to reassociation with G (cid:3)(cid:4) and thus enhance or prolong G (cid:3)(cid:4) - regulated effector activation ( 13 , 16 ) , and this hypothesis does have some support in the broader con - text of GPR proteins influencing G (cid:2) i (cid:3)(cid:4) subunit interactions ( 12 , 23 , 24 , 26 , 33 , 53 – 56 ) . The loss of AGS3 may thus lead to reduced chemokine - mediated G (cid:3)(cid:4) signaling , which is the most likely explanation for the observed defects in Gpsm1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) leuko - cyte chemotaxis ( Fig . 3 ) , calcium mobilization ( Fig . 4 ) , and acti - vation of ERK1 / 2 and Akt ( Figs . 5 and 6 ) , all of which are known G (cid:3)(cid:4) effector pathways as discussed above . Taken together , the data strongly suggest that AGS3 plays a modulatory role on chemokine - mediated G (cid:3)(cid:4) signaling . As other GPR proteins are also expressed in immune tissues and cells , including LGN / Gpsm2 ( Fig . 1 ) ( 31 , 74 ) , AGS4 / Gpsm3 ( 75 ) , 4 and RGS14 ( 76 ) , it is possible that these proteins may be partially masking the effects of the loss of AGS3 in this process . Defining the roles of these GPR proteins in chemokine signal integration may reveal additional functional capacity of the GPR motif in this context and is a focus of current efforts . This study extends our previous work in defining functional roles of GPR proteins in the intact animal using the AGS3 / Gpsm1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) mouse model ( 18 , 23 , 24 , 26 ) . This model should continue to provide a valuable platform for further exploration into the functional impacts of GPR - G (cid:2) i module regulation on leukocyte function by examining other GPR proteins expressed in the immune system .
