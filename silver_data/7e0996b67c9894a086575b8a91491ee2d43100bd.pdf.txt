Institute of Structural Biology , University of Bonn , 53127 Bonn , Germany Abstract Nuclear actin has been demonstrated to be essential for optimal transcription , but the molecular mechanisms and direct binding partner for actin in the RNA polymerase complex have remained unknown . By using purified proteins in a variety of biochemical assays , we demonstrate a direct and specific interaction between monomeric actin and Cdk9 , the kinase subunit of the positive transcription elongation factor b ( P - TEFb ) required for RNA polymerase II pause - release . This interaction efficiently prevents actin polymerization , is not dependent on kinase activity of Cdk9 and is not involved with releasing P - TEFb from its inhibitor 7SK snRNP complex . Supporting the specific role for actin in the elongation phase of transcription , chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing ( ChIP - seq ) reveals that actin interacts with genes only upon their active transcription elongation . This study therefore provides novel insights into the mechanisms by which actin facilitates the transcription process . Introduction Actin is an abundant protein having essential roles both in the cytoplasm and in the cell nucleus . It is a key component of the cytoskeleton , but inside the nucleus its functions are mostly related to gene expression control and maintenance of genomic integrity ( Ulferts et al . , 2021 ) . The basic unit of actin is the globular monomer ( G - actin ) that can polymerize into filaments ( F - actin ) and the proper balance of these forms , maintained by actin - binding proteins ( ABPs ) , is critical for actin functions . Shuttling of actin between the cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments is an active process and the two pools of actin are dynamically connected . Actin is imported into the nucleus by Importin - 9 ( Ipo9 ) together with small ABP cofilin ( Dopie et al . , 2012 ) and exported by Exportin - 6 ( Exp6 ) as a complex with ABP profilin ( Stuven et al . , 2003 ) . Nuclear actin is an important regulator of gene expression . G - actin is a stoichiometric subunit of several chromatin remodeling and modifying complexes , which control the structure and accessibility of chromatin ( Klages - Mundt et al . , 2018 ) . Actin also directly regulates the activity of specific transcription factors , such as myocardin - related transcription factors ( MRTFs ) that are co - activators of the serum response factor ( SRF ) . G - actin binding to MRTF prevents SRF activation ( Vartiainen et al . , 2007 ) , and there are various mechanisms to regulate MRTF / SRF pathway via altering actin nucleo - cytoplasmic transport and polymerization status ( Sidorenko and Vartiainen , 2019 ) . One of the essential functions of nuclear actin is its role in transcription regulation . For optimal transcription , the levels of actin inside the nucleus have to be controlled , as manipulating actin levels impairs transcription both in vitro and in cells ( Dopie et al . , 2012 ; Hu et al . , 2004 ; Philimonenko et al . , 2004 ; Sokolova et al . , 2018 ) . Decreased nuclear actin levels in response to laminin - 111 and consequent PI3 kinase pathway attenuation leading to increased Exp6 activity have also been shown to destabilize Pol II and Pol III interactions with nuclear substructures , causing lower RNA synthesis rates and quiescence in mouse epithelial cells ( Fiore et al . , 2017 ; Spencer et al . , 2011 ) . In Drosophila ovaries , actin and Pol II co - occupy promoter regions of most transcribed genes , as well as the gene bodies of highly transcribed genes ( Sokolova et al . , 2018 ) . It is becoming clear that actin has functions throughout the transcription process . Actin has been linked to pre - initiation complex formation ( Hofmann et al . , 2004 ) and F - actin seems to cluster Pol II on inducible genes ( Wei et al . , 2020 ) , promoting the formation of the transcription machinery . Actin also functions in the elongation phase and in Pol I mediated transcription , also nuclear myosin I is suggested to be involved , possibly combining the motor function of myosin with actin polymerization ( Almuzzaini et al . , 2016 ; Philimonenko et al . , 2004 ; Ye et al . , 2008 ) . Furthermore , actin has been linked to Pol II pause - release ( Qi et al . , 2011 ) , an important control point of transcription by Pol II , in which the polymerase pauses shortly after elongation has started and needs positive transcription elongation factor b ( P - TEFb ) to proceed into productive elongation ( Core and Adelman , 2019 ) . In the transcription elongation phase , actin also associates with heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U ( hnRNP U ) ( Kukalev et al . , 2005 ) , and the function of actin here might be to recruit transcription coactivators , such as PCAF histone acetyltransferase ( Obrdlik et al . , 2008 ) . Finally , actin takes part in pre - mRNA processing , as previous results from our lab show that manipulating actin disturbs alternative splicing , either through a direct role in splicing , or by affecting Pol II elongation or pausing rate so that also weaker splicing sites could be used ( Viita et al . , 2019 ) . Altogether , there seems to be distinct roles for both monomeric and filamentous actin in transcription , and some interactions , in which the form of actin is not yet known . Despite vast evidence of actin functions in transcription , the direct binding partner of actin within the RNA polymerases is not known . Actin has been suggested to co - purify with all three RNA polymerases ( Pol ) : Pol I ( Fomproix and Percipalle , 2004 ) , Pol II ( Egly et al . , 1984 ; Smith et al . , 1979 ) and Pol III ( Hu et al . , 2004 ) and was already in the 1980’s indicated to be involved in transcription of protein coding genes ( Scheer et al . , 1984 ) . However , the form of actin associating with the polymerases is not known and the interaction remains to be characterized at a molecular level . Our mass spectrometry screen for nuclear actin interactome contained several transcription - related proteins as hits with BioID technique , detecting more transient interactions , but not in AP - MS that is best suited for stable binding events ( Viita et al . , 2019 ) . Also , most of the same proteins were captured with an actin mutant incapable of polymerization , suggesting that F - actin formation would not be needed for these interactions to take place . One of the BioID hits was both subunits of the P - TEFb complex ( Viita et al . , 2019 ) . Here we demonstrate that actin , in its monomeric form , binds directly and specifically to the P - TEFb subunit Cdk9 . We further demonstrate that actin associates with genes only upon their active elongation , and that the kinase activity of Cdk9 is neither required for the interaction with actin , nor actin recruitment to the transcribing genes . Functionally , actin is not involved in releasing P - TEFb from its inhibitory complex , and modestly influences Cdk9 kinase activity . Results Actin is recruited to the genes only upon active transcription elongation and does not directly interact with the RNA polymerase II Previous studies have implicated actin in several steps of transcription ( Hofmann et al . , 2004 ; Kukalev et al . , 2005 ; Obrdlik et al . , 2008 ; Qi et al . , 2011 ; Viita et al . , 2019 ) . By using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep - sequencing ( ChIP - seq ) , we have demonstrated that actin interacts with all transcribed genes near transcription start sites ( TSS ) in Drosophila melanogaster ovaries . In addition , we showed that actin accumulates on gene bodies of highly transcribed genes required for egg shell formation during Drosophila oogenesis ( Sokolova et al . , 2018 ) . Heat shock protein ( hsp ) genes encode chaperone proteins that are required to maintain proteostasis not only during proteotoxic stress , such as heat shock ( HS ) , but also during normal conditions . Indeed , many hsp genes are expressed also during Drosophila oogenesis ( Ambrosio and Schedl , 1984 ) . To study , if actin is binding to hsp genes in vivo , we used ChIP - seq on fly ovaries at room temperature ( 25°C ) . Similarly as we have reported earlier for the chorion genes ( Sokolova et al . , 2018 ) , actin was found on the gene body of Hsp68 ( Fig 1A ) . RNA polymerase II phosphorylated on serine 5 ( Pol II ) , peaked near the transcription start site ( TSS ) , but was also abundant on the gene body ( Fig 1A ) . Analysis of the 15 hsp genes revealed similarly that Pol II is more concentrated near the TSS than actin , which displayed a rather broad distribution centered on the coding region of the gene ( Fig 1B ) . Thus , actin and Pol II do not display identical binding patterns on the hsp genes . Since hsp genes are already abundantly expressed in fly ovaries without HS , we turned to the cultured fly cell line S2R + as a model to study robust HS - induced transcriptional activation , and performed ChIP - seq of actin and Pol II in cells cultured at room temperature ( non - heat shock ; NHS ) or heat shocked for 20 min at 37°C ( Fig 1C - E ) . In NHS conditions , Pol II is found mainly paused near the TSS of Hsp68 gene ( Fig 1C ) . However , actin did not display any significant enrichment on the Hsp68 gene ( Fig 1C ) under these conditions , when the gene is not being actively transcribed . When the cells were heat shocked , Pol II was strongly recruited to the Hsp68 gene and similarly as in fly ovaries , the distribution peaked near the TSS . Nevertheless , enrichment at the gene body and after the cleavage and polyadenylation site ( CPS ) was also very evident ( Fig 1C ) . Upon HS , and similarly as observed in fly ovaries , actin was enriched on the coding region of Hsp68 , but did not show particular enrichment near TSS ( Fig 1C ) . Analysis of the 15 hsp genes revealed the same pattern ( Fig 1D - E ) . Actin is not significantly associated with the hsp genes prior to their transcriptional activation by HS , but only accumulates to the genes upon their active transcription elongation ( Fig 1E ) . The binding patterns of Pol II and actin are not similar ( Fig 1D - E ) , indicating that actin does not interact with all Pol II complexes . In several earlier studies , actin has been shown to co - purify with the RNA polymerases ( Egly et al . , 1984 ; Fomproix and Percipalle , 2004 ; Hu et al . , 2004 ; Smith et al . , 1979 ) , but the details of this interaction have remained uncharacterized . We purified whole , transcriptionally active human Pol II from HeLa nuclear pellets to gain further insight into the possible interaction . However , in our Western blot of samples taken during the purification process ( Fig S1A ) , actin was present in the first steps of the purification , but was lost during anion exchange ( samples 3 - 4 ) , indicating that the interaction is not stable and that actin is not an integral component of the purified polymerase , since it is not found in the final protein preparation ( Fig S1A , sample 8 ) . We then studied , if the purified proteins would form a complex that would persist in size - exclusion chromatography ( SEC ) using buffer conditions optimal for actin and NaCl concentration of 100 mM to improve the performance of the gel filtration column . In this experiment , actin was complexed with Latrunculin B ( LatB ) , a small molecule inhibiting actin polymerization that would otherwise take place when salt is present . The two proteins eluted from the SEC column in different fractions ( Fig S1B ) , which means that no complex was formed . This experiment suggests that actin , in its monomeric form , cannot directly interact with Pol II . This finding is further supported by our mass spectrometry ( MS ) screen for nuclear actin binding partners , which did not identify any Pol II subunits as high - confidence interactors in either affinity - purification - MS or BioID experiments ( Viita et al . , 2019 ) . Actin monomers bind directly to the Cdk9 subunit of P - TEFb Our ChIP - seq data demonstrated that actin bound only to actively elongating genes ( Fig 1C , E ) , suggesting that a protein specifically required for transcription elongation may recruit actin to the transcribing polymerase . Previous studies had demonstrated that actin can be co - immunoprecipitated with P - TEFb ( Qi et al . , 2011 ) , which plays a critical role in releasing the paused polymerase to active transcription elongation . Moreover , we had identified P - TEFb as a high - confidence interactor in our MS - based nuclear actin interactome analysis ( Viita et al . , 2019 ) . Nevertheless , neither of these studies were able to establish whether the interaction between actin and P - TEFb is direct or not . To study this further , we first confirmed the interaction between these two proteins by using co - immunoprecipitation assay . Indeed , Flag - tagged Cdk9 , the kinase subunit of P - TEFb , could be co - immunoprecipitated with HA - tagged actin , but not with an empty vector control ( Fig 2A ) . To gain insight into the functional form of actin involved in this interaction , we then performed the experiment using actin mutants that are either predominantly monomeric ( R62D , G13R ) ( Posern et al . , 2002 ) , favor polymerization ( V159N ) ( Posern et al . , 2002 ) or have mutations in the hydrophobic cleft , which is a commonly used site for actin - binding in many proteins ( Cao et al . , 2016 ) . Rather surprisingly , all tested actin mutants were able to co - immunoprecipitate Cdk9 , and the amount of Cdk9 detected in the IP sample seemed to correspond to the expression levels of Cdk9 construct in the input sample ( Fig 2B ) . Thus , this experiment did not provide further insights into the form of actin engaged with P - TEFb . To study , if the binding between actin and P - TEFb is direct , we purified His - tagged Cdk9 from insect cells and actin from rabbit skeletal muscle . We then complexed the actin with Latrunculin B ( LatB - actin ) to perform a pulldown assay using His - Cdk9 as a bait under physiological salt conditions . LatB - actin was detected on beads coated with His - Cdk9 , but not on beads with His - GST lysate ( Fig 2C ) . This assay demonstrates a direct interaction between actin and the Cdk9 subunit of P - TEFb , and also indicates that actin interacts with P - TEFb as a monomer . Next , we used the NBD actin monomer - binding assay ( Fig 2D - E ) to characterize the interaction between actin and Cdk9 further . In this assay , lysine 372 of actin is labeled with NBD fluorophore and upon protein binding near this residue , fluorescence of NBD changes and the changes can be recorded ( Detmers et al . , 1981 ) . Actin is always bound to a nucleotide , ATP or ADP , and this is a critical factor that controls the polymerization process and interactions with other proteins . In addition , actin secondary structure is different between ATP - and ADP - bound forms ( Zheng et al . , 2007 ) . Many actin monomer - binding proteins , such as thymosin β4 , profilin and MIM prefer to bind ATP - actin ( Carlier et al . , 1993 ; Mattila et al . , 2003 ; Vinson et al . , 1998 ) , whereas cofilin and twinfilin have higher affinity towards ADP - actin ( Carlier et al . , 1997 ; Ojala et al . , 2002 ) . With the NBD - actin assay , we observed that Cdk9 has a higher affinity towards ATP - actin ( Fig 2D ) compared to ADP - actin ( Fig 2E ) . Average experimentally defined dissociation constant ( K D ) towards ATP - actin from three independent replicate experiments was 375 nM , but for ADP - actin the K D could not be reliably defined , since the affinity was low . Cofilin was used as a control in our experiment and the K D values obtained experimentally here for cofilin binding match earlier results ( K D = 20 - 100 nM towards ADP - actin ) ( Blanchoin and Pollard , 1998 ; Carlier et al . , 1997 ; Vartiainen et al . , 2002 ) , verifying that the assay worked as expected . The NBD - actin assay thus further confirmed the direct interaction between actin monomers and Cdk9 , and suggested that the interaction is sensitive to the nucleotide status of actin . P - TEFb inhibits actin polymerization and the interaction is not dependent on the kinase activity of the complex To study how binding of P - TEFb affects actin , we next investigated actin polymerization with purified proteins by using pyrene actin polymerization assay ( Fig 3 ) . In this assay , G - actin is labeled with fluorophore pyrene and buffer conditions are changed to favor actin polymerization , which can be measured by following the increase in pyrene fluorescence as filaments form ( Doolittle et al . , 2013 ) . The P - TEFb complex used in these assays consisted of full - length Cdk9 and a C - terminally truncated version of Cyclin T1 ( amino acids 1 - 272 ) containing the cyclin - boxes only . This N - terminal domain of Cyclin T1 is widely used in both P - TEFb crystal structures ( Baumli et al . , 2008 ) and in vitro biochemical experiments , and demonstrated to activate Cdk9 ( Bieniasz et al . , 1999 ) . Our results show that actin binding to P - TEFb ( Fig 3A ) and to Cdk9 alone ( Fig 3B ) inhibits actin polymerization in a concentration dependent manner , likely by sequestering actin monomers . However , Cyclin T1 alone did not have any effect on actin polymerization ( Fig 3C ) , further confirming that Cdk9 is the binding partner for actin in the P - TEFb complex , as suggested already by our pulldown ( Fig 2C ) and NBD - actin assays with Cdk9 ( Fig 2D ) . To test , if the interaction is specific to P - TEFb , or a more general phenomenon for transcriptional Cdk / cyclin complexes , we tested purified Cdk12 / Cyclin K and Cdk7 / Cyclin H / Mat1 complexes in the pyrene actin assay ( Fig 3D - E ) . Cdk7 / Cyclin H / Mat1 did not influence actin polymerization ( Fig 3E ) , whereas Cdk12 / Cyclin K modestly decreased actin polymerization ( Fig 3D ) , but the effect was clearly weaker than observed with P - TEFb . Since actin binds to the P - TEFb complex via Cdk9 , which is a kinase , we wondered whether the kinase activity of Cdk9 might be required for the interaction . To this end , we used Cdk9 inhibitors flavopiridol ( Chao et al . , 2000 ) , NVP - 2 ( Olson et al . , 2018 ) and iCdk9 ( Lu et al . , 2015 ) in the pyrene actin polymerization assay . None of the inhibitors alone influenced actin polymerization ( Fig 4A ) . Moreover , they also did not affect the ability of Cdk9 to inhibit actin polymerization ( Fig 4A ) , leading us to conclude that the kinase activity is not needed for Cdk9 binding to actin monomers . To explore this further , we took advantage of the strong binding of actin to the gene bodies of hsp genes upon their transcription activation with HS ( Fig 1C - E ) and performed ChIP - qPCR experiments on the HS - responding gene Hsp70 . Interestingly , and in line with the biochemical experiments ( Fig 4B ) , inhibiting Cdk9 activity did not reduce actin - binding to the Hsp70 gene . Thus , kinase activity of Cdk9 is dispensable for both actin binding to P - TEFb and to actin recruitment to actively transcribing genes . Actin does not release P - TEFb from the inhibitory complex and has a minor influence on its kinase activity In cells , most of P - TEFb is bound to an inhibitory 7SK snRNP complex that is needed to control P - TEFb kinase activity and consequently Pol II transcription ( C . Quaresma et al . , 2016 ) . Apart from P - TEFb itself , our BioID assay for nuclear actin interacting proteins ( Viita et al . , 2019 ) identified P - TEFb regulators LARP7 , BRD4 and DDX21 as hits . This led us to hypothesize that actin could control the association of P - TEFb with these factors or the release of P - TEFb from 7SK snRNP , since LARP7 is part of the inhibitory complex , binding P - TEFb to promote its incorporation into the 7SK snRNP and regulating the stability of the 7SK ( C . Quaresma et al . , 2016 ) . To test this idea , we performed an in vitro P - TEFb release assay , in which 7SK snRNP from HeLa cells was immobilized with HEXIM1 antibody and purified muscle actin was added to the reaction as a possible release agent under conditions that keep actin monomeric . As expected , RNAse A released P - TEFb from the complex by degrading the 7SK RNA , and thus reduced the amount of Cdk9 that was co - immunoprecipitated with HEXIM1 ( Fig 5A ) . However , actin , at two different concentrations , did not reduce Cdk9 in the HEXIM1 co - immunoprecipitation ( Fig 5A ) . Thus , at least under these in vitro conditions , actin is not able to release P - TEFb from the inhibitory 7SK snRNP complex . Another intriguing possibility is that actin could regulate Cdk9 kinase activity . The function of P - TEFb in releasing paused Pol II is based on Cdk9 phosphorylating the negative transcription elongation factors NELF and DSIF and serines at position 2 in the Pol II C - terminal domain ( CTD ) ( Fujinaga et al . , 2023 ) . We thus set out to do an in vitro kinase assay , in which the phosphorylation of a biologically relevant CTD substrate by P - TEFb in the absence and presence of LatB - actin was analyzed by monitoring radioactive ATP . Based on our results , actin does inhibit P - TEFb kinase activity , but only at high concentrations ( Fig . 5B ) . Significant effect was observed only when actin was used at 20 times higher concentration than P - TEFb , in line with the relative affinity measured for the Cdk9 - actin interaction ( Fig 2D ) . Discussion Actin was linked to RNA polymerase function already almost 40 years ago ( Scheer et al . , 1984 ) . Since then , several studies have demonstrated defects in transcription upon actin manipulations , whether with antibodies against actin ( Hofmann et al . , 2004 ; Miyamoto et al . , 2011 ; Philimonenko et al . , 2004 ) , by altering nucleo - cytoplasmic actin shuttling ( Dopie et al . , 2012 ; Knerr et al . , 2023 ; Le et al . , 2016 ; Sokolova et al . , 2018 ; Wei et al . , 2020 ) , by actin mutants that are either predominantly monomeric or filamentous ( Almuzzaini et al . , 2016 ; Huang et al . , 2022 ; Knerr et al . , 2023 ; Qi et al . , 2011 ; Serebryannyy et al . , 2016 ; Wei et al . , 2020 ; Ye et al . , 2008 ) or by using different actin - binding drugs ( McDonald et al . , 2006 ; Miyamoto et al . , 2011 ; Wu et al . , 2006 ; Ye et al . , 2008 ) . Nevertheless , the molecular mechanisms by which actin affects RNA polymerase function have remained rather unclear . Here we use ChIP - seq and biochemical experiments with purified proteins to demonstrate that actin interacts with genes only upon their active transcription elongation and that actin binds directly to the Cdk9 kinase subunit of P - TEFb . Since P - TEFb plays an essential role in releasing paused Pol II to productive transcription elongation , we postulate that this interaction recruits actin to elongating polymerase to facilitate co - transcriptional processes . Earlier studies on selected target genes had indicated variable chromatin - binding patterns for actin , with some studies finding actin only on promoter regions ( Hu et al . , 2004 ) , some also on the gene coding regions ( Obrdlik et al . , 2008 ; Philimonenko et al . , 2004 ) , and yet others also on intragenic sites ( Ye et al . , 2008 ) . Our ChIP - seq studies in Drosophila ovaries revealed that actin binds to the promoter region of essentially all transcribed genes , but on highly expressed genes , it is also found on the gene bodies ( Sokolova et al . , 2018 ) . Thus , the chromatin - binding pattern of actin depends on the expression level of the gene . Nevertheless , our earlier study was not able to discern the exact step of transcription , where actin plays a role . Here we took advantage of the fact that actin is strongly associated with hsp genes ( Fig 1C - E ) , which have been widely used to dissect transcriptional mechanisms due to their robust activation upon HS . We found that actin associates with hsp genes only upon their active transcription elongation , and is not significantly present on the genes in the absence of HS , although the RNA polymerase can be readily detected as the paused polymerase ( Fig 1C ) . This indicated a functional role for actin specifically during the transcription elongation phase . However , we cannot exclude the possibility that actin could play a role also during other steps of transcription . For example , actin has also been linked to pre - initiation complex assembly ( Hofmann et al . , 2004 ) . It is possible that actin in this complex is not accessible to the antibody utilized here , warranting development of further reagents to study chromatin - binding properties of different forms of actin . Actin has been demonstrated to copurify with all three RNA polymerases ( Egly et al . , 1984 ; Fomproix and Percipalle , 2004 ; Hu et al . , 2004 ; Smith et al . , 1979 ) . Nevertheless , it has not been detected as an integral polymerase subunit in any of the high - resolution structural studies that have recently been conducted e . g . using cryo - EM methods ( Bernecky et al . , 2016 ; Fianu et al . , 2021 ; Liu et al . , 2018 ) . Accordingly , we did not detect actin in the highly pure Pol II prep ( Fig S1A ) and actin also did not bind to the purified Pol II in SEC experiments ( Fig S1B ) . In this latter case , as well as in some other experiments in this study ( Fig S1B , 2C , 5B ) , we had to use actin complexed with LatB to overcome the limitation of actin polymerizing in physiological salt conditions . Even though LatB is a small molecule polymerization inhibitor , it can prevent interactions taking place at the exact same position on actin . Latrunculins bind near the nucleotide binding cleft of actin ( Furstner et al . , 2007 ; Yarmola et al . , 2000 ) , which leaves the cleft between subdomains 1 and 3 where most actin binding proteins bind free for interactions ( Dominguez , 2004 ) . It is , however , possible that LatB prevents the interaction between actin and Pol II . Another intriguing idea is that actin could interact with Pol II as a filament . Indeed , Pol II clusters formed upon serum stimulation colocalize with nuclear actin filaments ( Wei et al . , 2020 ) and the links of nuclear myosins to Pol function have raised the idea of an acto - myosin motor operating during transcription ( Percipalle and Vartiainen , 2019 ) . Unfortunately , we were not able to test this biochemically , since the purified Pol II co - sedimented not only with actin filaments , but also with microtubules ( data not shown ) . Earlier studies with co - immunoprecipitation techniques ( Qi et al . , 2011 ) and our own nuclear actin interactome analysis ( Viita et al . , 2019 ) had shown an interaction between actin and P - TEFb , but not provided any biochemical details of this interaction . Here we significantly extend these studies by demonstrating that the interaction between actin and Cdk9 , the kinase subunit of P - TEFb , is direct . Using purified proteins , the direct interaction was detected in a pulldown ( Fig 2C ) , pyrene actin polymerization ( Fig 3A - B ) and NBD - actin monomer binding ( Fig 2D - E ) assays , and the specificity of the binding demonstrated e . g . by using other transcription regulating Cdk / cyclin complexes ( Fig 3D - E ) . Unfortunately , our attempts to gain further biochemical and structural information of the actin - P - TEFb complex proved unsuccessful . It might be that the interaction is very dynamic , which would also be supported with the relatively low affinity measured from the NBD - actin assays ( Fig 2D - E ) and the fact in the nuclear actin interactome analysis , P - TEFb was detected as a high - confidence interactor only with BioID , which detects also transient interactions , and not with affinity purification , which requires stable complex formation ( Viita et al . , 2019 ) . In addition , the interaction might be electrostatic , which leads to practical problems when performing the assays with actin and P - TEFb . When purified , P - TEFb is usually kept in a high salt buffer to preserve its integrity and kinase activity , whereas actin polymerizes in high salt conditions . It therefore turned out to be difficult to find experimental conditions , where the salt concentration is high enough to maintain P - TEFb functional , and actin would be kept monomeric . Interestingly , also Cdk12 / Cyclin K complex inhibited nuclear actin polymerization in the pyrene actin polymerization assays ( Fig 3D ) , but to lesser extent than Cdk9 or P - TEFb ( Fig 3A - B ) , whereas Cdk7 / Cyclin H / Mat1 did not influence pyrene actin polymerization ( Fig 3E ) . Of note , Cdk12 / Cyclin K and Cdk9 / Cyclin T1 share structural similarity , having open conformations ( Bosken et al . , 2014 ) , whereas Cdk7 / Cyclin H form is more closed ( Peissert et al . , 2020 ) . In the future , it will be interesting to study , if actin may play a role in regulating Cdk12 / Cyclin K complex , and cellular processes dependent on it . It is tempting to speculate that the interaction between actin and P - TEFb plays a role in recruiting this complex to elongating Pol II . Indeed , Qi et al . ( 2011 ) found that in nuclear extracts depleted of actin , Cdk9 was not recruited to immobilized transcriptional template , but the mechanism has remained unclear . In cells , most of P - TEFb is sequestered to the 7SK snRNP complex ( C . Quaresma et al . , 2016 ) . Of note , one component of this complex , LARP7 , was a hit in the BioID nuclear actin interactome assay ( Viita et al . , 2019 ) . Thus , we speculated that actin could release P - TEFb from the 7SK snRNP , and thereby promote its recruitment to Pol II . However , we did not obtain evidence of this in the P - TEFb release assay with increasing actin concentrations ( Fig 5A ) . Another intriguing possibility is that actin could influence P - TEFb by modulating the kinase activity of Cdk9 . Qi et al . ( 2011 ) performed an in vitro kinase assay using immunoprecipitation of different actin mutants overexpressed in HeLa nuclear extracts , after which CTD template and ATP were added to the reaction and the results are followed by Western blot . In this experimental setup , G - actin , but not predominantly filamentous actin , was found to stimulate serine 2 phosphorylation of Pol II CTD . We tested effects of actin to P - TEFb kinase activity using purified proteins to avoid possible effects of other proteins in nuclear extracts . We found that contrary to earlier results , high concentration of actin leads to less kinase activity ( Fig 5B ) . However , the effect was visible only at the highest actin concentration used . Therefore , it is not possible to conclude that in cells , actin would have a significant role in modulating the kinase activity of P - TEFb . It therefore seems that the stimulatory effect of actin on Cdk9 kinase activity detected earlier ( Qi et al . , 2011 ) is not direct , but mediated by another protein that remains to be identified . Intriguingly , the kinase activity of Cdk9 is not required for its interaction with actin , since the interaction persisted in the presence of different Cdk9 inhibitors ( Fig 4A ) . Moreover , actin accumulates to Hsp70 gene upon heat shock even when flavopiridol is present ( Fig 4B ) . It has been reported that although flavopiridol reduces Pol II CTD Ser2 phosphorylation , it does not affect Pol II or P - TEFb density on genes ( Ni et al . , 2004 ) . This indicates that the kinase activity is not needed for recruitment of P - TEFb to the gene . Hence , we currently favor a model , where the direct binding to Cdk9 recruits actin to the elongating Pol II . There actin , through some additional binding partners , could stimulate Cdk9 activity as suggested earlier ( Qi et al . , 2011 ) . This could explain why altering nuclear actin levels affects transcription elongation rate ( Viita et al . , 2019 ) . In addition , actin could also recruit other nuclear complexes to facilitate co - transcriptional processes . For instance , earlier studies have demonstrated that actin interacts with several hnRNP proteins ( Kukalev et al . , 2005 ; Percipalle et al . , 2002 ; Percipalle et al . , 2001 ) and our nuclear actin interactome analysis identified numerous proteins implicated in RNA processing , including core components of the spliceosome ( Viita et al . , 2019 ) . Detailed biochemical analysis of the underlying molecular interactions are needed to fully understand these tightly intertwined processes .
