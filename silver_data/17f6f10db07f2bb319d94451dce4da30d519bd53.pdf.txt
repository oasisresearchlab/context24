While designing intelligent negotiating agents , they mainly focus on the interaction protocol ( i . e . , what to exchange and how ) and strategy ( i . e . , how to generate offers and when to accept ) . Apart from these components , the embodiment may implicitly influence the negotiation process and outcome . The perception of a phys - ically embodied agent might differ from the virtually embodied one ; thus , it might influence human negotiators’ decisions and re - sponses . Accordingly , this work empirically studies the effect of physical and virtual embodiment in human - agent negotiations . We designed and conducted experiments where human participants ne - gotiate with a humanoid robot in one setting , whereas they negotiate with a virtually embodied replica of that robot in another setting . The experimental results showed that social welfare was statistically significantly higher when the negotiation was held with a virtually embodied robot rather than a physical robot . Human participants took the negotiation more seriously against physically embodied agents and made more collaborative moves in the virtual setting . Fur - thermore , their survey responses indicate that participants perceived our robot as more humanlike when it is physically embodied . CCS CONCEPTS • Computing methodologies → Intelligent agents .

Various studies support human - agent negotiations where software agents negotiate with their human counterparts [ 18 , 27 , 29 ] . Apart from designing offering strategies [ 17 , 30 ] , some work fo - cus on investigating the effect of emotion and facial expressions in human - agent negotiation ( e . g . , adopting angry facial expression versus happy facial expression during the negotiation ) [ 9 , 14 , 19 , 39 ] . Moreover , some studies address designing natural language process - ing models and dialogue strategies for human - agent negotiations [ 8 , 25 ] . As a complement , this work investigates the effect of negoti - ating with a physically embodied agent versus a virtually embodied agent on both negotiation outcome and interaction . Almost all works in the negotiation literature except some recent studies [ 3 , 35 ] have been built on an agent framework supporting either disembodiment [ 13 , 32 ] , or virtual embodiment [ 10 , 37 ] . On the other hand , physical embodiment may influence the social interaction as stated in [ 23 ] . Underlying interaction with the human may end up with a different outcome depending on whether the physical or virtual embodiment is adopted [ 26 ] . This study aims to fill this gap by investigating the effects of embodiment in human - agent negotiations where an autonomous negotiating agent uses some gestures and arguments to build rapport with and convince a human negotiator . To achieve this , we utilized the framework introduced in [ 3 ] by enriching gestures and moods used by our humanoid robot and creating a digital replica of our humanoid robot along with its en - vironment . Accordingly , we designed and conducted experiments where human participants negotiated with the physical and virtual robots on a given resource allocation problem . According to the empirical results , the participants were inclined to act more com - petitively against a physically embodied robot as it was sensed as a real competitor . Human participants made more collaborative moves during the negotiation in the virtual setting compared to the physical environment as far as the product utilities ( i . e . , the higher product is the more efficient outcome for both sides ) are concerned , nego - tiating with the virtually embodied robot ends in better results . All aforementioned insights can be utilized to improve the efficacy of human - agent negotiation frameworks . As suggested by [ 7 ] , virtual human agent platforms could be used to train human negotiators . It has been shown that human negotiators can improve their negotiation skills through numerous negotiation experiences with a virtual agent . Given the results , a physically embodied robot could be preferred for more challenging training . 2 RELATED WORK The effect of embodiment on interaction has been studied for decades [ 1 , 5 , 16 , 20 , 21 , 23 , 24 , 40 ] . This section overviews some leading works and mentions some related human - agent negotiation studies . IVA ’23 , September 19 – 22 , 2023 , Würzburg , Germany To begin with , Wainer et al . investigate the effect of the embod - iment of a supporting agent , which aims to help the participants solve the Towers of Hanoi game [ 40 ] . They evaluate physical and virtual embodied agents regarding their perception of human partic - ipants and social interaction . Their results support that physically embodied robots are perceived as most enjoyable to interact with and considered the most watchful among other setups , although the embodiment type does not affect the task performance ( i . e . , task completion time ) . Similarly , Leite et al . report that human chess players’ enjoyment was higher while interacting with a physically embodied robot over a virtual one [ 24 ] . Another study emphasizes the importance of physical embodiment in human - agent interaction and reports empirically that participants rated physically embodied social robots higher in terms of social presence and the quality of the interaction [ 23 ] . Moreover , Kiesler et al . designed an agent that interviews with human participants about their health and studies the embodiment effect in four different settings [ 20 ] . In the first setting , participants were interviewed with a physically embodied humanoid robot and a projection of that robot . In the second setting , a virtual agent and its projection interview participants . According to their experimental results , participants perceived that the physi - cally embodied robot had a more positive personality . Consequently , participants spent more time with the physically embodied robot and liked it more than the virtually embodied software agent . Furthermore , Kose et al . compare the effect of physical embod - iment , virtual embodiment , and no embodiment on children in a drumming game setup with a humanoid robot [ 21 ] . According to the results , children mimicked playing the drums better while inter - acting with the physically embodied robot using gestures than two other setups . Bainbridge et al . show that participants obey orders from physically embodied robots more than virtually embodied ones [ 5 ] . According to the questionnaire results , participants rated phys - ically embodied robots more positively and naturally than virtual ones . Moreover , Hoffman et al . observed that human participants preferred collaborating with a physically embodied robot in task - oriented scenarios , whereas they preferred the virtually embodied robot in conversational scenarios [ 16 ] . On the other hand , they report no significant difference between physical versus virtual embodi - ment in terms of persuasion and task performance . In the context of negotiation , Bevan and Fraser examine the ef - fect of handshaking before the negotiation on negotiation outcome through human - human negotiation experiments [ 6 ] . In their setting , two human participants are asked to negotiate on a single issue , namely price , by adopting the role of buyer or seller . There are two independent variables in their setting : telepresence and handshaking . For the former case , one of the participants is represented by a hu - manoid robot ( i . e . , teleoperated by the human negotiator ) , while the other participant negotiates with the robot controlled by the other human negotiator . For the latter variable , there are three possible op - tions : ( 1 ) no handshake before the negotiation , ( 2 ) human participant handshakes with the robot before the negotiation but no feedback is given to the human negotiator controlling the robot , and ( 3 ) the same as the previous one but haptic feedback is given to the hu - man controller . Their experimental results show that shaking hands before a negotiation increases social welfare in agreement utilities . The highest level of cooperation is obtained when the participants handshake with haptic feedback . In that study , participants negotiate with each other and a robot . The robot is used to present one of the participants to examine the effect of handshaking before the negotiation . In contrast , our primary focus is studying the effect of physical embodiment on human - agent negotiations , where a human negotiator negotiates with a fully autonomous humanoid robot . Furthermore , Thellman et al . study the effect of physical embodi - ment in a one - shot ultimatum game ( UG ) [ 35 ] . In their study , either a physically embodied “Nao” robot or a virtually embodied agent offers how they will share a certain amount of money , and human participants should respond either by an acceptance or rejection . While some participants negotiate with the robot , others negotiate with the virtual agent . Their between - subject analysis results show that social presence is essential for human - robot interaction , and being physically or virtually present does not affect the robot’s per - ception in a social sense . In contrast to that study , our work examines the effect of embodiment in a multi - issue negotiation with a more sophisticated fully autonomous negotiating agent using gestures and arguments during the negotiation . 3 HUMAN - AGENT NEGOTIATION In general , negotiations are about a finite set of 𝑛 issues I = { 1 , 2 , . . . , 𝑛 } [ 33 ] . Each issue 𝑖 ∈ I has a range of possible instantia - tions . In a resource allocation problem , each issue denotes a resource to be allocated in the negotiation ( e . g . , a list of fruits to be shared ) . Their values could be the amount of resources to be given to a ne - gotiating party . An outcome is a complete assignment to the set of issues , an offer is represented by 𝑜 . Preferences are represented by means of linear additive utility functions as shown in Equation 1 where 𝑤 𝑖 represents the importance of the negotiation issue 𝑖 for the agent , 𝑜 𝑖 represents the value for issue 𝑖 in offer 𝑜 , and 𝑉 𝑖 ( . ) is the valuation function for issue 𝑖 , which returns the desirability of the issue value . It is assumed that (cid:205) 𝑖 ∈I 𝑤 𝑖 = 1 and the domain of 𝑉 𝑖 ( . ) is in the range of [ 0 , 1 ] for any 𝑖 . Note that each negotiating party knows only its preferences and does not have access to its opponent’s preferences and negotiation strategy . U ( 𝑜 ) = ∑︁ 𝑖 ∈I 𝑤 𝑖 × 𝑉 𝑖 ( 𝑜 𝑖 ) ( 1 ) We adopt the Alternating Offers Protocol [ 2 ] to govern the in - teraction between human and agent negotiators . According to the protocol , the human participant makes the first offer in the negoti - ation . The party who receives an offer can either accept or make a counteroffer . This process continues in a turn - taking fashion until a termination condition is reached ( i . e . , reaching a deadline or agree - ment ) . In our study , a human participant negotiates with a humanoid robot to allocate given resources ; consequently needs to specify what resources they want for themselves and their amount . Instead of chat - based communication , speech - based communication is more convenient for humanoid robots . To accomplish this , the robot listens to the human participants constantly and analyzes what it hears in order to extract a structured offer by using regular expressions . By utilizing speech - to - text technology and a negotiation corpus , we re - duce mispronounced terms and enable the robot to gather the human participant’s intents . We then employ several grammar structures built specifically for the underlying domain . Effects of Agent’s Embodiment in Human - Agent Negotiations IVA ’23 , September 19 – 22 , 2023 , Würzburg , Germany The bidding strategy determines what to offer during the nego - tiation [ 12 ] . In our work , the agent calculates a target utility and makes an offer whose utility is the closest to it . Accordingly , we use the “Hybrid” strategy proposed in [ 19 ] that combines well - known time - dependent and behavior - dependent strategies . According to this strategy , the agent considers its opponent’s bidding behavior more than the remaining time in the beginning . As the negotiation progresses and the deadline approaches , it pays more attention to the remaining time . Here , the target utility at each turn is calculated as shown in Equation 2 where 𝑇𝑈 𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑒𝑠 and 𝑇𝑈 𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑒𝑠 are estimated by a time - dependent concession function provided by Vahidov [ 38 ] and an extension of the Tit - For - Tat Strategy [ 11 ] , which replicates the opponent’s moves to some extent , respectively . 𝑇𝑈 𝐻𝑦𝑏𝑟𝑖𝑑 = ( 𝑡 2 ) × 𝑇𝑈 𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑒𝑠 + ( 1 − 𝑡 2 ) × 𝑇𝑈 𝐵𝑒ℎ𝑎𝑣𝑖𝑜𝑟 ( 2 ) 4 DECISION MODULES & GESTURES Since the study aims to investigate the effect of embodiment in human - agent negotiations , we use a Nao humanoid robot and its virtual replica in this study to represent our negotiating agent , which we refer “Caduceus” 1 in the rest of the paper . This section explains the decision - making module ( i . e . , bidding and acceptance strategies ) and presents the designed gestures and arguments for more human - like interaction . Algorithm 1 illustrates how Caduceus makes its decisions and how its mood changes during the negotiation . At the beginning of each round , Caduceus first checks whether the deadline is reached . If so , it ends the negotiation ( Line 1 – 2 ) . Otherwise , it gen - erates its next offer according to its bidding strategy ( Line 4 ) . In this study , our negotiating agent employs the “Hybrid” bidding strategy explained in Section 3 . If the utility of the opponent’s current bid is higher than or equal to the utility of Caduceus ’s incoming offer ( i . e . , Happy mood ) , it accepts the given offer ( Line 5 – 6 ) . Recall that the higher the utility , the more desired the offer is . Otherwise , it makes its counteroffer ( Line 8 ) . Recall that its opponent first makes an offer , and Caduceus responds with an acceptance or a counteroffer . While making its offer , the agent determines its mood and adopts convenient gestures and arguments ( Line 9 ) . As human negotiators’ mood changes overtime during the negotiation depending on their opponent’s attitude and remaining time , we describe a number of moods for Caduceus related to negotiation based on [ 34 ] as follows : Happy : Our humanoid robot is satisfied with its opponent’s offer and accepts it if its utility is greater than or equal to the robot’s next offer ( i . e . , 𝑈 ( 𝑂 𝑡ℎ ) > = 𝑈 ( 𝑂 𝑡𝑐 ) ) Pleased : If the opponent concedes and the robot’s utility has increased significantly ( i . e . Δ 𝑈 > 0 . 25 ) , but their offer is not still acceptable for the robot ( i . e . , the opponent’s offer utility is less than the acceptance threshold , 𝑈 ( 𝑂 𝑡ℎ ) < 𝑈 ( 𝑂 𝑡𝑐 ) ) , it feels pleased . Hopeful : The robot adopts a hopeful mood if its opponent con - cedes , although its utility is not considerably changed ( i . e . , 0 . 25 = > Δ 𝑈 > 0 ) . This mood is activated if the opponent’s offer utility is less than the acceptance threshold , similar to the pleased mood . Neutral : When the opponent changes its offer’s content , but the robot’s utility is not changed ( i . e . , Δ 𝑈 = 0 ) , its mood becomes neutral . 1 It is a recognized symbol of commerce and negotiation in Greek mythology . Algorithm 1 : Caduceus’s Decision Module 𝑇 𝑑𝑒𝑎𝑑𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑒 , 𝑡 : Deadline & the current time ; 𝑂 𝑡𝑐 , 𝑂 𝑡ℎ : Caduceus’s counter offer & Human opponent’s offer ; 𝑂 ℎ : Human opponent’s offer history ; 𝑈 ( 𝑂 𝑡ℎ ) : The utility of human opponent’s offer for Caduceus ; 𝑅 : Reservation Utility ( i . e . , minimum acceptable utility ) ; 1 if 𝑡 > = 𝑇 𝑑𝑒𝑎𝑑𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑒 then 2 End - Negotiation ( ) ; 3 else 4 𝑂 𝑡𝑐 ← generateOfferWithHybrid ( 𝑂 ℎ , 𝑡 , 𝑇 𝑑𝑒𝑎𝑑𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑒 ) ; 5 if 𝑈 ( 𝑂 𝑡𝑐 ) ≤ 𝑈 ( 𝑂 𝑡ℎ ) then 6 Accept ( ) ; 7 else 8 MakeOffer ( 𝑂 𝑡𝑐 ) ; 9 mood ← getMood ( 𝑂 ℎ , 𝑡 , 𝑅 ) ; Dissatisfied : If the opponent makes a selfish move and decreases the robot’s utility by a small portion ( i . e . , - 0 . 25 < = Δ 𝑈 < 0 ) , it becomes dissatisfied and shows its dissatisfaction by using some arguments . Annoyed : If the opponent makes a selfish move that reduces the robot’s utility significantly ( i . e . , Δ 𝑈 < - 0 . 25 ) or makes the same offer twice ( i . e . , 𝑈 ( 𝑂 𝑡 𝑐𝑢𝑟 ℎ ) = = 𝑈 ( 𝑂 𝑡 − 1 ℎ ) ) , it becomes annoyed and expresses its annoyance using arguments . Frustrated : When one of the three conditions is met , the robot becomes frustrated : when the utility of its opponent’s offer is less than the reservation utility ( i . e . , 𝑈 ( 𝑂 𝑡ℎ ) < 𝑅𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 ) ; when the current negotiation time is greater than 75 % , and the opponent’s offer utility for the robot is less than the half ( i . e . , 𝑡 > 75 % & 𝑈 ( 𝑂 𝑡ℎ ) < = 0 . 5 ) ; or when its opponent makes the same offer thrice or more ( i . e . , 𝑈 ( 𝑂 𝑡ℎ ) = = 𝑈 ( 𝑂 𝑡 − 1 ℎ ) = = 𝑈 ( 𝑂 𝑡 − 2 ℎ ) ) . Worried : As the deadline approaches , the robot hurries its op - ponent forward . Different predefined negotiation times . Caduceus used to inform the opponent three times on 40 % , 60 % , and 80 % of the negotiation time . We enriched the gesture set defined in [ 3 ] . As seen in Figure 1 , 14 different gestures are prepared for expressing the current moods . In line with those gestures , Caduceus picks one of the convenient arguments from the prepared argument set in Table 1 : 5 METHODOLOGY To study the effect of the robot’s embodiment ( i . e . , physical or virtual ) in human - agent negotiations , we set up a user experiment where the human negotiator negotiates with a virtually and physically embodied agent in a resource allocation scenario . Accordingly , we suggest and examine two hypotheses as follows : Hypothesis 1 ( H1 ) : The utility of the negotiation outcome reached by human negotiators would be significantly different when they negotiate with a virtually embodied agent than that of when they negotiate with a physically embodied agent . Hypothesis 2 ( H2 ) : The human negotiator would perceive the physically embodied agent as more humanlike than the virtually embodied agent .

You should revise it . I hope we can find a deal today ! Frustrated Do you really think that is a fair offer ? It is not acceptable at all . I am very disappointed with your offer . It is not acceptable at all . Your offer is not acceptable . Please put yourself in my shoes . We cannot reach an agreement . Let’s try to be more collaborative . Worried The deadline is approaching . Let’s find a deal soon . We are running out of time . Let’s be more cooperative to find a deal . Hurry up ! We need to find an agreement soon . 5 . 1 Experimental Setup To test the aforementioned hypotheses , we created a virtual replica of our physically - embodied agent along with our framework . Note that the agent employs the same negotiation strategy , speech recognition method , gesture , and argument sets in both settings . As Figures 2a and 2b show our experimental setups , participants can see their preference profiles ( lower left - hand corner ) , the current offer ( top center ) along with their utility ( upper right - hand corner ) , remaining time ( upper left - hand corner ) , and some auxiliary sentence structures for possible actions ( lower right - hand corner ) on the TV screen while negotiating with Caduceus . It is worth noting that virtual and physical setups are almost identical . Official Nao tool called Choregraphe [ 31 ] is used to generate robot gestures for both setups . For virtual setup , each gesture is prerecorded and then used by our negotiation tool to represent the virtual Caduceus . The physical robot that is used during the experiments is also the same model and version in the Choregraphe so the gestures are identical in both settings . The details of the experimental protocol are explained elaborately in the following section . ( a ) Physical setting ( b ) Virtual setting Figure 2 : Human - agent negotiation settings 5 . 2 Experiment Protocol In our experiments , human participants are asked to negotiate with the “Nao” humanoid robot named Caduceus in both physical and virtual settings ( i . e . , within - subject design ) . To minimize the learning effect , we counterbalance the negotiation session order . Half of the participants negotiate with the physically embodied Caduceus and then negotiate with the virtually embodied Caduceus while the other half negotiate in reverse order . Note that there is a 5 - minute break between two negotiation sessions . As a role - playing game , participants are asked to negotiate ac - cording to a given resource allocation scenario . According to the given scenario , participants and Caduceus are lucky customers in a supermarket who will receive free fruits as a reward . Eligibility of this reward requires finding an agreement on how they will share fruits between them . There are four types of fruits , and there are four of each fruit type . Each participant should collect at least 40 points ; otherwise , they will receive zero points . There is also a time limitation for this game . They need to reach an agreement in 15 minutes ( i . e . , deadline ) . If they cannot reach an agreement within 15 minutes , they fail the negotiation and receive zero points . Since it is essential to introduce an incentive for taking the underlying negotiations seriously , we promise them to give a 5 $ gift card from a well - known supermarket brand if they negotiate well and encourage them to maximize their score . Table 2 shows preference profiles of Caduceus and its human counterpart for both sessions . Note that the participants know only their scores and are informed that Caduceus does not know their scores either . The outcome utility space is plot - ted in Figure 3 to show that each party has the equivalent agreement space where there are 625 possible outcomes in this scenario . All participants experienced with the same negotiation scenarios 2 . Before each negotiation session , the interaction protocol is ex - plained to the participants via a demo video . Besides , they have a training session where they negotiate on a more straightforward problem for 5 minutes to get familiar with the negotiation process . During their negotiation , participants communicate with Caduceus via speech in both virtual and physical settings . In addition , we pre - pared an interface displaying some necessary information that makes 2 We would like to state that the experiment protocol adopted in this study was approved by the Ethics Committee of our university , and informed consent was obtained from all participants . Effects of Agent’s Embodiment in Human - Agent Negotiations IVA ’23 , September 19 – 22 , 2023 , Würzburg , Germany Figure 3 : Outcome utility space of the grocery scenario Table 2 : Preference profiles for negotiation sessions First Negotiation Second Negotiation Items Caduceus Participant Caduceus Participant Watermelon 4 12 12 4 Banana 1 8 8 1 Orange 12 4 4 12 Apple 8 1 1 8 a human participant’s life easier , as seen in Figure 2 . Figure 4 shows the environment we conducted the experiments . As seen , the par - ticipant sits across Caduceus so that it can observe the Caduceus ’s gestures and the display screen . Before their second negotiations , they are told that their preferences are utterly different , although only the order of the scores is changed , and the value distribution of the scores remains the same for a fair evaluation . In order to analyze the negotiation results , the framework automatically logs the negoti - ation results ( i . e . , whether or not they reach an agreement ; if so , the utilities of the negotiation agreement for both sides ) , the number of rounds to complete each session as well as duration , offer exchanges during the negotiation and the percentages of participants’ moves . After completing both sessions , they fill out two questionnaire forms regarding their first and second negotiation session . Figure 4 : Experimental setting for human - robot negotiation 5 . 3 Participants We have recruited 52 participants ( i . e . , bachelor and graduate stu - dents from the faculty of Engineering , and departments of Commu - nication Design , and Aviation ) ; 40 males , 12 females ; aged between 18 and 42 ) for our human - robot experiments . Since the medium of instruction in our experiments is English , we asked participants to rate their English level on a scale of 1 - 7 ( 1 for the beginner ; 7 for advanced ) . The average English level of participants is 5 . 65 . Since we mainly investigate to what extent the embodiment af - fects the interaction of the human negotiators with the designed negotiating robot from different perspectives , a fair evaluation re - quires a certain amount of experience in both settings . Sometimes , participants can find an agreement immediately after a few rounds . In such a case , they would not have enough experience with the developed environment , so we cannot detect the impact of the pres - ence even if it exists . In our previous human - robot negotiations , we observed that , on average , participants completed their negotiation around five rounds . Therefore , we decided to eliminate the records of the participants who completed one of their negotiations in less than five rounds . As a result , our analysis considers only 30 ( 23 males , seven females , aged between 18 and 36 ) participants’ negotiation sessions . The reader may wonder why we do not ask the participants to repeat the negotiation to satisfy the minimum number of interac - tions . If you allow the participants to repeat the same negotiation session in this case , the learning effect from their previous negotia - tions would change their negotiation behavior ; therefore , this bias effect is avoided by filtering those records . Note that counterbalance groups are not affected by this elimination . 6 EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS After conducting the experiments , applying a convenient statistical test is essential . Since our experimental setting is a within - subject de - sign , we could apply a two - tailed dependent sample t - test . To check the applicability of this test , we first apply the Kolmogorov - Smirnov normality test and Levene’s Test ( i . e . , homogeneity of Variance ) [ 22 ] . If the data distribution passes these tests , the dependent sample t - test is applied ; otherwise , a non - parametric statistics test , namely the Wilcoxon - Signed Rank test . All statistical tests results are given at the 95 % confidence interval ( i . e . , 𝛼 = 0 . 05 ) . We first compare the negotiation performance of the partici - pants / agents in both settings . It is worth noting that all negotiation sessions ended with an agreement . Figure 5 shows the average util - ities gained by both parties separately and the average normalized products of utilities where the orange and blue color bars denote their scores in physical and virtual environments , respectively . As far as the individual agent utility ( i . e . , Caduceus ’s utility ) is concerned , it is seen that Caduceus received higher utility by little difference on average when it was virtually embodied ( 0 . 66 versus 0 . 69 ) . When we applied the Kolmogorov - Smirnov normality test on physically and virtually embodied agent scores , results show that they are dis - tributed normally ( 𝑝 = 0 . 43 , 𝑝 = 0 . 25 for physical and virtual settings , respectively ) . We also tested the homogeneity of variance , and the homogeneity requirement was met ( f - ratio = 0 . 47 , p = 0 . 49 ) . There - fore , we applied the two - tailed dependent sample t - test . However , the results are not statistically significantly different on agent utility under the two - tailed dependent sample t - test with a 95 % confidence interval ( t = - 1 . 63 and 𝑝 = 0 . 11 ) . When the average utility gained by the human participants was investigated , we observed that their aver - ages were close to each other in both environments ( 0 . 80 vs . 0 . 81 ) . Since these utilities are not normally distributed according to the Kolmogorov - Smirnov , we applied a non - parametric statistics test , IVA ’23 , September 19 – 22 , 2023 , Würzburg , Germany namely the Wilcoxon - Signed Rank Test . We have observed no statis - tically significant effect of physical embodiment on the user utilities ( Z = - 0 . 085 , p = 0 . 92 ) . Our statistical test results do not reject the null hypothesis , so there is no statistical support for H1 . Figure 5 : Avg . individual utilities and normalized product scores Moreover , the normalized utility product , which denotes the so - cial welfare of the outcomes , is calculated by dividing the product of utilities of Caduceus and its human counterpart by the Nash Product ( i . e . , maximum utility product in the outcome space ) . In our scenario , the Nash Product is equal to 0 . 64 . When we applied the Kolmogorov - Smirnov normality test to the normalized utility product results , they were distributed normally ( 𝑝 = 0 . 17 , 𝑝 = 0 . 06 , for physical and virtual settings , respectively ) . We also tested the homogeneity of variance , and the homogeneity requirement was met ( f - ratio = 1 . 13 , p = 0 . 29 ) . Therefore , we applied the two - tailed dependent sample t - test . Although the averages of the utility prod - ucts in physical and virtual settings are close to each other ( 0 . 81 versus 0 . 86 , respectively ) , their means are statistically significantly different ( t = 2 . 209 , p = 0 . 03 ) , according to this test . Embodiment has a medium - large effect on normalized utility product ( Cohen’s D = - 0 . 59 , % 95 confidence interval [ - 0 . 994 - 0 . 185 ] ) . That is , the agreements were better for both parties when the negotiation was held in a virtually embodied setting . According to our observation , participants’ tendencies towards cooperation and negotiability increase while they are negotiating with the virtually embod - ied robot . Interactions become more severe , and competitiveness increases during physically embodied negotiations . As a result , the social welfare of the negotiation outcomes are higher when human negotiators negotiate with a virtually embodied agent . We investigate the bidding behavior of each participant in our ex - periments . In the literature , Thomas proposes the Thomas - Kilmann Conflict Mode Instrument based on the degree of assertiveness ( i . e . , satisfying own concerns ) and cooperativeness ( i . e . , satisfy - ing other person’s concerns ) of humans [ 36 ] . Accordingly , we study the assertiveness and cooperativeness of the participants . Since as - sertiveness measures the individual attempts to satisfy their con - cerns / preferences , we group the offers made by each participant and take their averages separately for both settings . When we applied the normality test on physically and virtually embodied assertiveness , results show that they are distributed normally ( 𝑝 = 0 . 1 , 𝑝 = 0 . 2 for physical and virtual settings , respectively ) . We also tested the homogeneity of variance and met the requirement of homogeneity . ( f - ratio = 0 . 00002 , 𝑝 = 0 . 99 ) . Therefore we applied the two - tailed dependent sample t - test . As seen , there is no statistically significant difference in the assertiveness of the participants on average in vir - tual and physical settings ( 0 . 83 and 0 . 84 , respectively ) according to the dependent t - test ( t = 0 . 47 , 𝑝 = 0 . 64 ) . However , when we investi - gate the assertiveness of the participants at the individual level , we can observe that some participants tended to offer higher utilities for themselves in the virtual environment compared to the physical environment , others acted in the other way around . Without a doubt , there are individual differences . Cooperativeness is the measurement of the individual attempts to find a mutual agreement . We consider the percentages of cooperative moves made by the human partic - ipants in order to estimate their cooperativeness level as seen in Equation 3 where definitions of those “moves” can be found in [ 15 ] . 𝐶𝑜𝑜𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑠𝑠 = % 𝐹𝑜𝑟𝑡𝑢𝑛𝑎𝑡𝑒 + % 𝑁𝑖𝑐𝑒 + % 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 ( 3 ) When we applied the Kolmogorov - Smirnov normality test on physically and virtually embodied cooperativeness , results show that they were distributed normally ( 𝑝 = 0 . 58 , 𝑝 = 0 . 51 for physical and virtual settings , respectively ) . We also tested the homogeneity of variance , and the homogeneity requirement was met ( f - ratio = 0 . 15 , p = 0 . 69 ) . Therefore , we applied the two - tailed dependent sample t - test . When we applied a two - tailed dependent t - test on the cooper - ativeness of the participants in the physical and virtual setting , we found that participants had more cooperative moves when negotiated against virtually embodied robots ( t = 2 . 178 , p = 0 . 04 ) . On average cooperativeness level of human participants while negotiating with the physically embodied robot , Caduceus , was 0 . 51 , whereas it was 0 . 57 while facing the virtually embodied robot . It is observed that human participants act more competitively against a physically embodied agent than a virtually embodied one . As far as the normalized agreement time is concerned , shown in Figure 6 , the parties reached agreements slightly faster when Caduceus was virtually embodied ( on average agreement time for physical embodiment : 0 . 483 versus for virtual embodiment : 0 . 467 ) . When we applied a two - tailed dependent sample t - test , we have not observed a statistically significant effect of using different embodi - ment on agreement time ( t = - 0 . 35 , p = 0 . 72 ) . Similarly , there is no statistically significant difference in the number of rounds to reach an agreement ( t = - 1 . 64 , 𝑝 = 0 . 11 ) . However , the participants agreed on slightly lower rounds ( on average 10 . 2 versus 12 . 13 ) . ( a ) Normalized time ( b ) Rounds Figure 6 : Average agreement time and negotiation round 6 . 1 Analysis of Questionnaire Subjective evaluation of the system was done through the question - naire filled in by the participants at the end of the experiment . The Likert questions are on a 7 - point scale ( 1 for strong disagreement , Effects of Agent’s Embodiment in Human - Agent Negotiations IVA ’23 , September 19 – 22 , 2023 , Würzburg , Germany four is for neutral , and 7 for strong agreement ) . The questionnaire consists of 17 questions about their first and second negotiation sessions . Since asking these questions after their first negotiation may influence their attitude in their second negotiation , we asked the questions at the end of their experiment . In addition , participants are asked about the experimental setup in general . The means and standard deviations of their responses to those questions are as fol - lows : ( i ) I understand the experimental instructions . They were clear . ( Average : 6 . 86 ± 0 . 36 ) ; ( ii ) The demo session shown before the experiment was instructive . ( Average : 6 . 86 ± 0 . 36 ) ; and ( iii ) Since our communication channel was speech , I found the interaction hu - manlike . ( Average : 5 . 23 ± 1 . 43 ) . It can be seen that the instructions and interaction protocol were clear . Figure 7 shows the negotiation and embodiment - related survey questions and the average rating of the participant’s responses . The responses are grouped according to what embodiment they face in the negotiation session . The resulting average ratings of the more positively structured statements are above 4 points ( i . e . , neutral ) , whereas the responses to the negative - structured statements , such as Q5 , are below 4 points . The questions where we found a statistically significant difference are boldfaced ( i . e . , Q2 and Q12 ) . When we applied the normality test on responses to Q2 results , they were distributed normally ( 𝑝 = 0 . 13 , 𝑝 = 0 . 29 for physical and virtual settings , respectively ) . The homogeneity requirement was also met ( f - ratio = 1 . 43 , 𝑝 = 0 . 23 ) . When the two - tailed dependent t - test is applied , we found that embodiment has a statistically significant effect on the participant’s response to “ Caduceus negotiated with me like a human negotiator . ” ( Q2 ) ( t = - 2 . 62 , 𝑝 = 0 . 013 ) . Embodiment has a small - medium effect on Q2 ( Cohen’s D = 0 . 36 , % 95 confi - dence interval [ - 0 . 027 0 . 744 ] ) . In the case of Q12 , we applied the Wilcoxon - signed Rank test . It also has a statistically significant effect on responses to “ Caduceus ’ gestures were mostly consistent with the situation” ( z = - 1 . 96 , p = 0 . 05 ) . As a result , participants perceived Caduceus as more humanlike ( on average 5 . 4 versus 4 . 9 ) and found Caduceus ’ gestures more consistent compared to virtual ( on average 6 . 2 versus 5 . 76 ) when it was physically embodied . Embodiment has a small - medium effect on Q12 ( Cohen’s D = 0 . 4 , % 95 confidence interval [ 0 . 012 0 . 788 ] ) ) . Those results support H2 . According to the question , “I was frustrated with Caduceus ’ attitude during the negotiation . ” ( Q5 ) , it can be observed that the robot’s attitude did not frustrate the participants for both physical and virtual versions ( on average , 3 . 13 and 3 . 63 , respectively ) . Moreover , regarding the question , “ Caduceus paid attention to my gestures during the negoti - ation . ” Q ( 15 ) , participants think that the robot does not consider their gestures ( on average , 4 . 1 and 3 . 86 , respectively ) . Indeed , Caduceus did not consider their gestures during the negotiation . During our unstructured interview at the end of the experiment , some participants stated that they enjoyed negotiating physically em - bodied Caduceus more than virtually embodied one . Some positive comments received from the participants are “ Caduceus’ gestures are understandable . ” , “ I wanted to negotiate with a physically em - bodied robot twice . ” , and “ I felt like physically embodied Caduceus was more than a robot . ” . We received a few negative comments such as “ Domain does not suit to negotiation with a robot . ” and “ I focused on the screen to maximize my utility instead of Caduceus ” . Q - 1 Caduceus negotiated in a fair way . Q - 2 Caduceus negotiated with me like a human negotiator . Q - 3 Caduceus guessed my preferences accurately . Q - 4 Caduceus tried to find the best deal for both of us . Q - 5 I was frustrated with Caduceus’ attitude during the negotiation . Q - 6 I am satisfied with my negotiation performance . Q - 7 Caduceus’ attitudes were important for my next offer during the negotiation . Q - 8 While Caduceus was making its offers , it consider my negotiation behavior . Q - 9 While Caduceus was making its offers , it consider remaining time . Q - 10 I enjoyed negotiating Caduceus . Q - 11 It was easy to communicate with Caduceus . Q - 12 Caduceus’ gestures were mostly consistent with the situation . Q - 13 I paid attention to Caduceus . Q - 14 Caduceus’ gestures affected my decisions during the negotiation . Q - 15 Caduceus paid attention to my gestures during the negotiation . Q - 16 Caduceus was convincing during the negotiation . Q - 17 I was likely to engage in negotiation with Caduceus . Figure 7 : Average scores of questionnaire responses 7 CONCLUSION We envision that human - agent collaboration considerably impacts society’s productivity and well - being if the underlying infrastruc - ture for such cooperation is carefully designed . The embodiment may implicitly influence human counterparts’ behaviors . The choice of agent’s embodiment could be made based on the expected en - gagement and collaborativeness . Accordingly , this work empirically investigates the effect of physical embodiment on human - agent nego - tiations . Experimental results showed that social welfare was higher when the negotiation was held with a virtually embodied robot rather than a physically embodied robot . Participants were more inclined to collaborate and reach an agreement while negotiating with the virtually embodied robot . While negotiating with the physically em - bodied robot , interactions grew tenser , and competitiveness increased based on our negotiation traces . Human participants made more col - laborative moves during the negotiation in the virtual setting . Lastly , questionnaire results showed that participants perceived our robot as more humanlike and the robot’s gestures more consistent with the underlying situation in the physical setup . As future work , we plan to study the effect of the embodiment on human - robot negotiations by involving different types of humanoid robots to see whether the cooperativeness of the human participants towards other humanoid robots varies concerning their appearance . Studying essential mea - sures of individual variations such as the Big Five , assertiveness , and cooperativeness would be interesting .
