This cross - sectional study aimed to assess adolescent health and anxiety during the COVID - 19 pandemic . 1300 male adolescents filled out the Male Adolescent Health Need Assessment Scale ( MAHNAS ) and corona - related anxiety scale ( CRAS ) from January to May 2021 . Data analysis was done using SPSS version 22 . The mean age of adolescents was 15 . 5±2 . 25 , and most of them ( 65 % ) were studying in high school . The mean scores for physical health were 78±7 . 55 , psychological health 48 . 8±5 . 55 , social health 48 . 21±8 . 61 , sexual health 50 . 35±9 . 05 , and anxiety scores were severe ( 46 . 76 ) in this study . There was a significant negative relationship between anxiety and health needs . The COVID - 19 pandemic greatly affected the health needs of adolescents . Effec - tive approaches and policies in this crisis , especially for adolescents , can alleviate the anxious reactions and be a way to meet their health needs appropriately .

SARS‐CoV‐2 ep - idemic is becoming a global problem [ 1 , 2 ] . Inhalation or con - tact with infected droplets is the main way of transmission . Fever , fatigue , sore throat , cough , breathlessness , and malaise are the most common symptoms . The case fatality rate is about 2 to 3 % , with all ages vulnerable [ 3 , 4 ] . There is no special treatment so far . The logical way to cope with SARS‐CoV‐2 is by controlling the source of infection , guarding vulnerable people , and cutting off the transmission . People should take measures to protect themselves , such as home quarantine , social contacts limitation , and use a mask in public places [ 5 ] . In addition , the authorities should recommend people to stay home , discourage mass gatherings , delay or cancel public events , and public institutions must be closed [ 3 ] . According to the WHO declaration , this universal situa - tion may negatively impact the well - being of individuals , which in turn impacts individuals ' performance [ 6 ] . Previous data on mass happenings , like natural disasters , shows that troublesome large - scale events are strongly associated with negative effects on health status and are followed by other behavioral and psycho - logical chaos [ 7 ] . One of the most vulnerable age groups who suffered great - ly from this crisis is adolescents . The period between childhood and adulthood , from ages 10 to 19 , has been identified as adoles - cence . It is a unique phase of human development and a unique time for laying the foundations of good health [ 8 ] . However , the COVID - 19 pandemic is putting the health and well - fare of all children and adolescents in danger . Injus - tice in this field is increasing every day , and there are no suitable health interventions for adolescents , adolescents being a vulner - able segment of society . Schools were closed in many countries at the height of lockdown , affecting 1 . 6 billion students [ 9 ] . Peer support groups and face - to - face services have been postponed , and cell phone or online support can be demanding for some young people . Becoming overweight among adolescents and chil - dren was getting worse , and acute stress disorder was more likely to develop in isolated or quarantined children during the pan - demic [ 10 ] . The aim of this study was to assess the health needs of adolescents during the pandemic . Due to the lack of sufficient studies in this field , it is necessary to identify the health needs to deliver the requirements for proper planning and policy - making to promote adolescent health . © 2022 JOURNAL of MEDICINE and LIFE . VOL : 15 ISSUE : 5 MAY 2022 676 JOURNAL of MEDICINE and LIFE MATERIAL AND METHODS This study had a cross - sectional correlational design and recruited 1300 male adolescents ( 13 – 19 y / o ) studying in high schools from January to May 2021 . Inclusion criteria were not be - ing married and studying in public schools . The exclusion criteria were declining to participate after completing the questionnaire . The sampling method was random multistage , and we used the table of random numbers with Tehran schools . The number of samples based on the proportion of adolescents living in each area was estimated until the total sample was completed . Online classes were also randomly selected in each school , and students were requested to fill out data collection tools online or offline according to their preferences . The demographic question - naire and the Male Adolescent Health Need Assessment Scale ( MAHNAS ) were used . The MAHNAS consisted of 49 questions under the four dimensions of " sexual health " , " physical health " , " psychological health " , and " social health " with a 5 - point Likert type scale ( never = 1 , ever = 5 ) . The scores obtained ranged from 49 to 245 , with higher scores indicating a better health condition and lower needs for health supervision . The psychometric prop - erties of this scale were controlled using Cronbach ' s α coefficient of . 79 and intraclass correlation index of . 89 using a test - retest method [ 11 ] . The corona - related anxiety scale ( CRAS ) was also used , comprising 18 items with 4 - point Likert answers ( never = 0 , ever = 3 ) . The score of the corona - related anxiety severity was di - vided into three domains : mild ( 0 – 16 ) , moderate ( 17 – 29 ) , and severe ( 54 – 30 ) . The Guttmann ' s λ2 value for the whole ques - tionnaire was obtained as λ = 0 . 922 , Cronbach ' s alpha coefficient for psychological symptoms as α = 0 . 879 , physical symptoms as α = 0 . 861 , and the whole questionnaire as α = 0 . 919 [ 12 ] . The col - lected data were analyzed using descriptive and t - test , one - way analysis of variance , and the Pearson correlation coefficient sta - tistics via the SPSS Version 22 . RESULTS The mean age and standard deviation of 1300 male ado - lescents in this study were 15 . 5±2 . 25 years . Most of them were in high school ( 65 % ) , had mothers with diplomas ( 41 . 2 % ) , and fathers with bachelor ' s degrees ( 37 . 8 % ) . Most mothers were em - ployed ( 33 % ) , and fathers were business owners ( 41 . 9 % ) . Accord - ing to the Kolmogorov Smirnov test , the data had normal distri - bution , and the large sample size allowed us to use parametric statistical tests . Table 1 shows the mean scores of MANHAS in each domain . Table 1 shows that physical and social health have higher scores than sexual and psychological health . In other words , sex - ual and psychological health domains need more attention to im - prove . Lower scores indicate higher health needs . The MANHAS instrument got an average score of 49 . 34 . Table 2 demonstrates Domain Mean ( standard deviation ) Highest score Lowest score Physical health need 78 ( ±7 . 55 ) 96 58 Psychological health need 48 . 8 ( ±5 . 55 ) 68 30 Social health need 48 . 21 ( ±8 . 61 ) 70 30 Sexual health need 50 . 35 ( ±9 . 05 ) 60 41 Total health need 49 . 34 ( ±5 . 05 ) 61 38 Table 1 . The MANHAS scores are based on the score of 100 in each domain . Table 2 . Descriptive characteristic of CRAS in male adolescents . Samples ( n = 1300 ) Mild ( 0 – 16 ) Moderate ( 17 – 29 ) Severe ( 30 – 54 ) Adolescent 105 ( 8 . 09 % ) 587 ( 45 . 15 % ) 608 ( 46 . 76 ) the number and percent of adolescents according to the severity of corona - related anxiety . Table 2 shows that most adolescents suffer from severe anxi - ety of coronavirus ( 46 . 76 % ) , and just a few of them ( 8 . 09 % ) con - sider coronavirus a mild stressor in their life . Consequently , this novel virus represents a strong stressor for adolescents . Table 3 shows the significant correlation between MANHAS and CRAS scores in 1300 male adolescents . Table 3 shows a significant negative correlation between all domains of MANHAS and anxiety of coronavirus . Higher anxiety is accompanied by a lower score and greater needs are apparent . The physiological and social needs had a stronger cor - relation with anxiety than physical and sexual health needs . DISCUSSION This study aimed to evaluate the health needs of male ad - olescents during the COVID - 19 pandemic . Most research on Covid - 19 has been focused on adults and less on adolescents . This study reported a high prevalence of mental health prob - lems in adolescents . Moreover , valid and reliable tools used to assess adolescents ' health need status during the Covid - 19 crisis can identify the real health needs of adolescents and inform pol - icy - making . The large sample size and sampling of various parts of the city and including various health domain needs were other positive hallmarks of this study . Table 3 .

VOL : 15 ISSUE : 5 MAY 2022 677 JOURNAL of MEDICINE and LIFE According to the results , the health needs of the physical dimension were favorable , and this may be since , during the Covid - 19 crisis , individuals were more observant of their private and public health , such as washing hands , wearing masks , and forced distance . Proper nutritional status , especially to strengthen the immune system during the Covid - 19 , was another measure of good physical health status in this study . Furthermore , in a pre - vious study in Iran , the state of physical health was also estimated to be in good condition [ 13 ] . One study in Ireland evaluated the physical activity of ado - lescents during the Covid - 19 pandemic and declared that adoles - cents reported less physical activity ( 50 % ) , no change ( 30 % ) , or did more physical activity during lockdown ( 20 % ) . Adolescents who did less physical activity were more likely to be overweight [ 14 ] . On the other hand , many social and psychological health needs were evident during the Covid - 19 crisis among Iranian adolescents . In fact , most of the health needs in this area were reported . The Covid - 19 crisis has increased these needs , and mental health services and interventions should be planned in public and private institutions to reduce the crisis in adolescents . The COVID - 19 outburst triggered difficulties for child psychia - try and mental health services that must be directed , including public institutions covering interventions for major public health crises affecting youth . A greater challenge for this age group is dealing with lockdown and quarantine , which may push children into calamity and weaken families , especially when severe quar - antine exists in the mentally or psychologically vulnerable [ 15 ] . Young people have to be separated from their loved ones during quarantine , afraid of their family and friends and need to cope with the Covid - 19 crisis . These factors affect health , especially psychological health and well - being [ 16 ] . Many studies indicated that restrictions and limitations in previous pandemics and epidemics put pressure , stress , anxiety , emotional fatigue , post - traumatic stress disorder , and fear on the human being . Adolescents experience other severe stressors during a pandemic lockdown and quarantine , such as stress , infection , death , imprisonment , social contact limitation , help - lessness , depression , anxiety , panic attacks , and even suicidality [ 17 – 19 ] . Several investigations in China declared that the rate of depression , anxiety , and psychological stress during COVID - 19 was higher in children and adolescents [ 20 – 22 ] . Some research - ers suggest various methods to alleviate these negative effects ; for example , in Brazil , doing more activity and working out could alleviate mental health disorders in youth . Some factors signifi - cantly reduce mental distress related to Covid - 19 , such as phys - ical exercise , multimedia , books , and physical activity [ 23 , 24 ] . Social factors in the health of adolescents have always played an undeniable role . Adolescents ' health generally refers to phys - ical health and neglected social health . Epidemiological trans - mission changed the profile of adolescents ' health needs . Lack of knowledge and attention to adolescents ' health needs leads to high - risk situations , increased addiction rates in adolescents , aca - demic failure , and psychosocial disorders . Adolescent mortality is not common ; instead , the global burden of disease and disability is greater . Adolescent health crises need to be addressed and pre - vented on time [ 13 ] . According to a study previously performed in Iran to promote psychological and social health , community , family , schools , and mass media empowerment is essential for health authorities and good health policies . All these factors that affect vulnerable youth are more important in the Covid - 19 cri - sis ; therefore , more serious attention from policymakers is recom - mended in Iran [ 25 , 26 ] . Another aspect of health needs is sexual health , which was not in a good or bad situation . According to the literature , sexual education has been less observed in the real context . Half of the adolescents ' sexual problems are ignored in Iran [ 27 , 28 ] . The current attention is also placed on boys ' needs to formally gain more information and receive health education [ 27 ] . Covid - 19 has made the situation worse than before . The lack of specif - ic policies on adolescent sexual health education and restrictive rules for schools showed that sexual health issues were not prior - itized in developing programs by government authorities in the Ministry of Health and Medical Education and the Department of Education [ 29 ] . Unfortunately , children are out of control of the health system from the age of eight and do not enter until middle age obligatory . Many researchers similarly believed that sexual health policies needed to be revised . Considering appropriate ideas , interests , strategies , and tactics to perform evidence - based health interventions in sexual and reproductive health is man - datory [ 30 , 31 ] . In this study , coronavirus anxiety affected all aspects of teenage health . Obviously , fears concerning health are a typical response in the face of the Covid - 19 pandemic . Children and young people are often exposed to death messages from the me - dia and authorities and Covid - 19 will probably be the first ma - jor global health threat to young people during the pandemic . This fear jeopardizes adolescents ' and children ' s beliefs that the world is a safe place to live [ 32 ] . Therefore , providing an effec - tive , empathic communication system with the direct participa - tion of teenagers is important . Finally , psychological counseling services for the stress management of adolescents may help them to survive [ 33 ] . CONCLUSION In our study , all domains of adolescent health were affected by the Covid - 19 except for physical health . Therefore , more at - tention and policies are needed to meet the needs of adolescents in Iran . ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Conflict of interest The authors declare no conflict of interest .
