WOODINGS 1 , Stewart J . SHARP 1 and Laura M . MACHESKY 2 School of Biosciences , University of Birmingham , Edgbaston , Birmingham B15 2TT , U . K . We have found that MIM - B , a putative metastasis suppressor protein , is implicated in actin cytoskeletal control and interaction with a protein tyrosine phosphatase ( PTP ) . MIM was originally described as a protein whose mRNA was Missing in Metastasis , as it was found not to be present in metastatic bladder carcinoma cell lines [ Lee , Y . G . , Macoska , J . A . , Korenchuk , S . and Pienta , K . J . ( 2002 ) Neoplasia 4 , 291 – 294 ] . We further characterized a variant of MIM , which we call MIM - B , and which we believe may be a link between tyrosine kinase signalling and the actin cytoskeleton . We have shown , using puriﬁed proteins and cell extracts , that MIM - B is an actin - binding protein , probably via a WASP ( Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein ) - homology 2 domain at its C - terminus . We have also found that MIM - B binds to the cytoplasmic domain of receptor PTP d . Expression of full - length INTRODUCTION There are many physiological signals that can trigger changes in cell motility and shape . Thus the actin cytoskeleton is controlled by signals from a variety of receptors , including tyrosine kinases , G - protein coupled receptors and integrin - related receptors . One of the main controlling pathways of actin assembly in cells appears to involve Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ) - family proteins , including the ﬁve mammalian components ( WASP , N - WASP , Scar } WAVE1 - 3 ) and the Arp2 } 3 com - plex [ 1 ] . The Arp2 } 3 complex consists of seven subunits , two of which are related to actin and thought to participate in the nucleation of new actin ﬁlaments oﬀ the sides of pre - existing ones [ 1 ] . The WASP proteins bind directly to Arp2 } 3 and activate its nucleation activity . Signals from receptors , including tyrosine phosphorylation either directly [ 2 ] or through adapter protein recruitment [ 3 , 4 ] , activation of the small GTPases Cdc42 and Rac or changes in membrane phospholipid composition , are thought to activate WASP - family proteins at the plasma mem - brane . How receptors communicate with speciﬁc WASP - family proteins using these diﬀerent mechanisms is still an area of active research . Cells contain proteins divergently related to the WASP - family proteins , which also appear to be important regulators of the actin cytoskeleton . WASP is composed of the following modular domains ( listed here in consecutive order from the N - to the C - terminus ) : WH1 ( WASP - homology 1 ) , GBD ( GTPase binding domain ) , Pro ( proline - rich ) , WH2 ( WASP - homology 2 ) and CA ( central basic plus acidic Arp2 } 3 binding ) . WH2 motifs bind to actin monomers [ 5 ] . Several proteins in eukaryotes have been identiﬁed which contain WH2 homology regions . Most of these proteins are linked to functions in polarity and actin cytoskeletal Abbreviations used : DLAR , Drosophila leukocyte common antigen - related ; GST , glutathione - S - transferase ; MIM , missing in metastasis ; RPTP , receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase ; RPTP d - CD , cytoplasmic domain of RPTP d ; WASP , Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein ; WH2 , WASP - homology 2 . 1 These authors contributed equally to this work . 2 To whom correspondence should be addressed ( e - mail L . M . Machesky ! bham . ac . uk ) . MIM - B induces actin - rich protrusions resembling microspikes and lamellipodia at the plasma membrane and promotes dis - assembly of actin stress ﬁbres . The C - terminal portion of MIM - B is localized in the cytoplasm and does not aﬀect the actin cytoskeleton when expressed , while the N - terminal portion localizes to internal vesicles and probably targets the protein to membranes . We postulate that MIM - B may be a regulator of actin assembly downstream of tyrosine kinase signalling and that this activity may explain the involvement of MIM in the metastasis of cancer cells . Key words : actin , cytoskeleton , metastasis , motility , phospha - tase , signalling . regulation . In Saccharomyces cere (cid:138) isiae , for example , verprolin is a WH2 - containing protein that interacts with the WASP hom - ologue Las17p } Bee1p [ 6 ] . Verprolin regulates polarity , cyto - kinesis , endocytosis and cytoskeletal organization [ 7 , 8 ] . Another WH2 - containing protein is p150Spir , which may be involved in transport from the trans - Golgi network to the plasma mem - brane [ 9 ] . In Drosophila , p150Spir ( also called SPIRE ) is important in polarity [ 10 , 11 ] . A new protein MIM ( missing in metastasis ) has been identiﬁed which contains a C - terminal WH2 motif and is postulated to be an important regulator of the actin cytoskeleton [ 12 ] . Receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases ( RPTPs ) , including RPTP d [ 13 ] , RPTP a [ 14 ] and RPTP b [ 15 ] , have been linked in many studies to cell motility and the actin cytoskeleton . RPTP d regulates the chemotaxis of neurons toward a gradient of its own extracellular domain [ 16 , 17 ] . Another related phosphatase , Drosophila leukocyte common antigen - related ( DLAR ) , is a Drosophila RPTP that is related to the human LAR ( leukocyte common antigen - related acetate ) as well as to RPTP d . DLAR binds to the actin cytoskeletal protein Ena [ 18 ] and regulates the organization and polarity of basal F - actin in the follicular epithelium of Drosophila [ 19 ] . DLAR also interacts with the Rac } Rho GEF ( guanine nucleotide exchange factor ) trio [ 20 ] . In addition to being involved with the actin cytoskeleton and motility , RPTPs are also implicated in the regulation of cell - matrix and cell – cell adhesion . For example , RPTP a dephos - phorylates and activates Src family kinases , which in turn phosphorylate components of adherens junctions to modulate cell – cell contacts [ 14 ] . We describe here a unique protein ( MIM - B ) containing a WH2 motif at the C - terminus , which we postulate to be involved in cell motility and } or adhesion and for which a fragment of a # 2003 Biochemical Society 464 J .

MIM - B binds to actin with a micromolar aﬃnity in (cid:138) itro , using puriﬁed protein , and in (cid:138) i (cid:138) o when expressed in COS - 7 cells . MIM - B also binds to the cytoplasmic domain of the RPTP d in the yeast two - hybrid assay and in extracts from COS - 7 cells incubated with recombinant RPTP d . MIM - B localizes to areas of dynamic actin assembly and intracellular vesicular structures and overexpression of MIM - B leads to the assembly of actin - rich protrusions resembling surface ruﬄes and microspikes . We propose that MIM - B links receptor tyrosine phosphatase signalling with actin cytoskeletal reorganization and provides a potential new link between tyrosine phosphorylation signalling and the actin cytoskeleton .

S . A . ; [ 13 ] ) . Protein preparation Glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) - fused MIM - B fragments were prepared as previously described for WASP - family proteins [ 25 ] and using glutathione – agarose beads . The puriﬁed protein was cleaved from the beads using thrombin . Thrombin was removed with p - aminobenzamidine beads ( Sigma ) and proteins were used fresh or separated into aliquots and frozen at ﬁ 80 (cid:176) C . Actin was puriﬁed from rabbit muscle acetone powder by the method of Spudich and Watt [ 21 ] and gel - ﬁltered [ 22 ] to isolate monomers for polymerization assays . Pyrene actin was prepared as described previously [ 23 ] and gel - ﬁltered as above . Fresh actin was used within a week of preparation and pyrene actin was separated into aliquots and stored at ﬁ 80 (cid:176) C . Yeast two - hybrid assay The yeast two - hybrid assay was performed as previously de - scribed [ 24 ] using a human brain library ( Clontech ) screened with pYTH9 coding for amino acids 404 – 705 of MIM - B . Two positive clones were obtained and both were sequenced and found to encode amino acids from position 1347 to the C - terminus of the cytoplasmic domain of the RPTP d . The interaction was re - tested by transforming RPTP d and 404 - 705MIM - B back into Y190 yeast and assaying Gal4 activity using the ﬁlter assay [ 24 ] . Positive controls were Scar1 and p21 - Arc and negative controls were 404 - 705MIM - B or 404 - 759MIM - B against Scar1 or RPTP d - CD and p21 - Arc . Actin binding to MIM - B constructs was tested in a pulldown assay as follows : recombinant MIM - B proteins fused to GST were isolated on glutathione – agarose beads and equilibrated with G - buﬀer ( 2 mM Tris } HCl , pH 7 . 5 , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 5 mM dithiothreitol , 2 mM CaCl # ) . Beads were then incubated with monomeric actin for 30 min at 4 (cid:176) C . A control tube containing no actin was included . After three washes in G - buﬀer , the proteins in the supernatant and pellet fractions were separated by SDS } PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue . A semi - quantitative estimate of the binding of actin to the GST beads was made using the computer programme NIH Image to measure the area and density of each band . A one - site binding curve of actin concentration against the binding ratio of actin } MIM - B fragment was plotted using computer - assisted curve ﬁtting ( Prism 2 Graphpad Software ) . The equation ﬁtted was : Y ﬂ B max [ X } ( K d › X ) where B max is the maximum concentration of binding sites ( which is the same as the concentration of recombinant protein ) , K d is the dissociation equilibrium constant and X is the concentration of actin . Actin polymerization Actin polymerization assays were performed as described pre - viously [ 23 ] . Brieﬂy , recombinant protein was added to 3 l M actin [ 5 % ( w } w ) pyrene - labelled ] in G - buﬀer . Polymerization was initiated using 10 ‹ KME ( 50 mM KCl , 1 mM EGTA , 1 mM MgCl # ) and continued for 7200 s . An excitation wave - length of 370 nm was used and emission was measured at a wavelength of 407 nm using a PTI C60 spectroﬂuorimeter ( Photon Technology International ) . RPTP d binding to MIM - B ( pulldown assays ) COS - 7 cells ( approx . 6 ‹ 10 ’ cells per experiment ) were trans - fected with MIM - B constructs using Fugene 6 ( Roche ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . After 24 h , cells were placed on ice for 5 min and washed twice with PBS containing protease inhibitors ( CLAP : chymostatin , leupeptin , antipain and pep - statin at a ﬁnal concentration of 0 . 1 l g } ml of each and PMSF at 50 l M ) . Cells were then overlayed with 200 l l of GST - binding buﬀer [ 10 % glycerol , 50 mM Tris } HCl , pH 7 . 4 , 100 mM NaCl , 1 % ( v } v ) IgepalCA - 630 ] for a further 5 min before scraping into a tube . After centrifugation for 5 min in an eppendorf centrifuge at 16000 g , cell supernatants were incubated with 30 l l of GST - PTP d - CD recombinant protein on glutathione – agarose beads for 30 min at 4 (cid:176) C . After 3 washes in GST - binding buﬀer , the supernatants and pellets were separated on 8 % polyacrylamide gels in SDS and analysed by Western blotting . Cell biology Transient transfections were performed using Polyfect ( Qiagen ) for NIH3T3 cells or Fugene 6 ( Roche ) for COS - 7 cells , according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Anti - myc antibodies were a gift from Alan Hall ( Department of Biochemistry , MRC - LMCB , London , U . K . ) and Robert Insall ( School of Biosciences , Uni - versity of Birmingham , U . K . ) , secondary antibodies were pur - chased from Jackson Labs ( Stratech Scientiﬁc Ltd . , Soham , # 2003 Biochemical Society 466 J . A . Woodings and others U . K . ) . Cells were ﬁxed in 4 % paraformaldehyde in PBS and mounted in Mowiol with antifade , as described previously [ 24a ] . RESULTS We identiﬁed MIM - B from the NEDO ( New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization , Japan ) hu - man cDNA sequencing project ( Genbank 2 AK027015 and Figure 1A ) . This cDNA encodes a protein that is predicted to be nearly identical to YGL - 1 ( Genbank 2 AF086645 ) and which has a C - terminal sequence ( amino acids 404 – 759 ) that is nearly identical to a fragment of YGL - 1 [ HUGE ( Human Unidentiﬁed Gene - encoded Large Proteins database , Kasuza , Japan ) KIAA0429 ] . There are three point substitutions between YGL - 1 and MIM - B , which probably correspond to sequencing errors , and an insertion of four extra codons in the N - terminal domain of MIM - B . Both cDNAs map to the same locus of chromo - some 8 and we propose to call the products MIM and MIM - B . MIM proteins appear to be conserved , with homologues in mouse ( results not shown ; [ 25 ] ) , Drosophila ( Figures 1B and 1C ) , and Caenorhabditis elegans ( Figures 1B and 1C ) but not to our knowledge in S . cere (cid:138) isiae or Dictyostelium . Humans appear to have two closely related isoforms , with only 6 amino acids diﬀerent between YGL - 1 and MIM - B . The closest relative to YGL - 1 or MIM - B appears to be the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase substrate BAIP1 - 2 or IRSp53 ( Figure 1D ) , which has limited homology in the N - terminal region . It is interesting to note that MIM - B is also likely to be a substrate for tyrosine phosphorylation , so this homology may be related to interaction with tyrosine kinases or membranes ( see below ) . MIM - B , like MIM , has a WH2 motif at the extreme C - terminus ( Figure 1E ) which shows a high degree of identity with the WH2 motifs of verprolin , WIP and actobindin . This WH2 is quite diﬀerent from those found in WASP ( Figure 1E ) and other WASP - family proteins ( results not shown ) but both types of WH2 appear to bind with micromolar aﬃnity to monomeric actin ( [ 26 , 27 ] and see below ) . Since MIM - B had a WH2 motif , we tested whether this motif was functional in binding to actin monomers . We performed pulldown assays using recombinantMIM - B fragments and rabbit muscle G - actin and found that the smallest fragment that would still signiﬁcantly interact with G - actin corresponded to amino acids 404 – 759 ( Figure 2 ) . Deletion of the WH2 motif to create 404 - 705MIM - B eliminated the binding , showing that the WH2 motif is necessary for the interaction ( Figure 2 ) . It is likely that amino acids near the WH2 motif also contribute to the actin association , or to the overall protein structure and folding , as 664 - 759MIM - B bound almost no G - actin in a pulldown assay ( Figure 2 ) . Semi - quantitative analysis of the binding to G - actin revealed a 0 . 5 l M K d for 404 - 759MIM - B , the largest fragment that we were able to produce in Escherichia coli . A summary of the constructs tested in this assay and whether we detected an interaction with G - actin is shown in Figure 1 ( A ) . These fragments also interacted with G - actin in crude lysates from bovine spleen or from COS - 7 cells , as detected with pulldown and Western blot analysis ( results not shown ) . Therefore we conclude that the WH2 motif in MIM - B is functional for binding to actin monomer and MIM - B is thus implicated as a potential regulator of the actin cytoskeleton . Figure 3 MIM - B sequesters actin monomers 3 l M actin [ 10 % ( w / w ) pyrene - labelled ] was mixed with buﬀer or proteins as indicated and polymerization was induced at time zero .

Figure 2 Actin monomers binding to MIM - B The graph shows actin - binding curves to 404 - 759MIM - B ( * , n ﬂ 3 . 6 ) , 404 - 705MIM - B ( ^ , n ﬂ 3 ) , and 706 - 759MIM - B ( D , n ﬂ 6 ) . The binding ratio is the amount of actin / the amount of MIM - B fragment ( A / MF ) in the pellet fraction . Actin binding to 404 - 705MIM - B did not increase with actin concentration and is therefore non - speciﬁc binding . Actin binding to 706 - 759MIM - B is at a very low level ( see Discussion section ) . The K d for actin binding to 404 - 759MIM - B was calculated as 0 . 53 l M . We further analysed the interaction of MIM - B with actin , using a polymerization assay to determine whether MIM - B sequestered actin monomers , similar to other WH2 - containing proteins [ 27 ] . Addition of increasing concentrations of MIM - B fragments that contained the WH2 motif slowed the nucleation and elongation of the actin in a similar manner to other WH2 proteins or to proﬁlin . A short fragment containing the WH2 motif ( amino acids 664 – 759 ) caused approx . half - maximal inhibition at 500 nM ( Figure 3A ) , whereas a longer fragment , 404 - 759MIM - B , was slightly less eﬀective ( Figure 3B ) . Deletion of the WH2 motif ( 404 - 705MIM - B ) completely abolished the eﬀect on actin assembly ( Figure 3C ) . Within a concentration factor of two , most constructs containing the WH2 motif behaved identi - cally in this assay , and without the WH2 motif , no inhibition of polymerization was observed . The results from all constructs tested in this assay are summarized in the table in Figure 1 ( A ) . We conclude that the WH2 motif is necessary and , to the limits of this assay , suﬃcient for interaction with actin monomers and that the complex of MIM - B with actin monomer behaves qualitatively as sequestered actin , in a similar manner to other WH2 proteins or to proﬁlin - actin complexes [ 27 ] . Since most of the MIM - B sequence is unique upstream of the WH2 motif , we used a yeast two - hybrid screen with 404 - 705MIM - B to search for MIM - B - interacting proteins . Screening a human brain library , we obtained two positive clones which both contained the PTP d - CD . These were the only two positive clones identiﬁed in our screens with a human brain library ( Clontech ) . We conﬁrmed the interaction by retransformation of Y190 yeast with 404 - 705MIM - B and 404 - 759MIM - B and a cDNA fragment encoding the cytoplasmic domain of RPTP d ( Figure 4A ) .

COS - 7 cells expressing myc - tagged MIM - B or human a - actinin ( as a negative control ) were lysed and incubated with glutathione – agarose bound to recombinant GST - PTP d - CD or glutathione beads ( see Methods section ) . Bound and free fractions were separated and run on SDS / PAGE for Western blotting . The blot was probed with anti - myc to detect tagged MIM - B ( lanes 1 , 11 , 12 ) or 404 - 759MIM - B ( lanes 5 , 6 , 9 , 10 ) or myc - a actinin ( lanes 13 , 14 ) .

The yeast two - hybrid interaction of MIM - B with RPTP d - CD was conﬁrmed using recombinant RPTP d - CD expressed in E . coli and fused to GST and various constructs of MIM - B expressed in COS - 7 cells . Beads containing RPTP d - CD , but not GST alone , bound to full - length MIM - B and to fragments of MIM - B con - taining amino acids 404 – 705 ( Figure 4B ) . While we attempted to study the interaction between endogenous MIM - B and RPTP d - CD , we were unable to produce antisera against MIM - B which recognized the endogenous protein ( results not shown ) , and although we obtained an antibody to RPTP d - CD ( kindly provided by Michel Streuli ) , we were not able to detect endogenous RPTP d with this reagent ( results not shown ) . It may be that these proteins are expressed at low levels , and } or that MIM - B is not particularly antigenic in rabbits , but so far , attempts with soluble protein , inclusion bodies and peptides have failed to produce a good quality antibody . A summary of all fragments of MIM - B which gave a positive interaction with PTP d is shown in the table in Figure 1 ( A ) . To determine whether MIM - B might be involved in actin cytoskeletal re - organization in cells and to investigate its cellular localization , we expressed myc - tagged full - length MIM - B and fragments encoding the N - and C - terminal portions of the protein . Full - length MIM - B induced actin - rich protrusions re - sembling surface ruﬄes and ﬁlopodia ( Figure 5 , panels A , A « and A § ) . Cells expressing MIM - B also lost stress ﬁbres . This pheno - type was observed in more than 70 % of the cells ( n ﬂ 50 cells ) . We observed the Arp2 } 3 complex co - localizing in the surface protrusions and ruﬄes , indicating that the Arp2 } 3 complex is likely to be involved in the actin assembly via MIM - B expression ( Figure 5 , panels B , B « and B § ) . Expression of the N - terminal portion of MIM - B ( 1 - 520MIM - B ) did not aﬀect the actin cytoskeleton detectably ( Figure 5 , panels C , C « and C § ) but this construct localized to cytoplasmic vesicles ( arrows on Figure 5C ; more than 50 % of the cells contained several vesicular structures ; n ﬂ 50 cells ) . In contrast , the C - terminal portion of MIM - B ( 404 - 759MIM - B ) , containing the WH2 motif , showed a cytoplasmic localization and did not detectably aﬀect the actin cytoskeleton ( Figure 5 , panels D , E , D « , E « and D § , E § ; n ﬂ 50 cells ) . We obtained similar results with both COS - 7 cells and NIH3T3 cells for all constructs , and representative experiments are shown . DISCUSSION We have found that human MIM - B is an actin - monomer - binding protein that sequesters actin monomers in (cid:138) itro in a similar manner to other WH2 - containing proteins . MIM - B is conserved in mouse , C . elegans and Drosophila , and shows weak homology to BAIP1 } IRSp53 proteins in the N - terminal portion . IRSp53 was originally identiﬁed as a substrate for the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase , so the homology between these proteins may reﬂect interaction sites for tyrosine kinases . Also , this is the region of MIM - B which localizes to membranes when expressed with a myc - tag , so it may be important for targeting to membranes . No other proteins were found to have signiﬁcant homology to MIM - B , except at the region of the WH2 motif . Mattilla et al . [ 25 ] , also recently characterized the mouse MIM homologue and found it to be an actin - binding protein that is primarily expressed in developing brain tissue and myoblasts . MIM - B binds to actin monomers with a micromolar aﬃnity in bead pelleting assays , which is also similar to the aﬃnities reported for WASP - family proteins , or actobindin for actin monomers [ 21 , 22 ] . The WH2 motif is required for this actin - binding activity . The WH2 motif of MIM - B appears to have a somewhat lower aﬃnity for actin monomers than that of the recently identiﬁed mouse MIM ( 0 . 5 l M for human versus 0 . 06 l M for mouse , see [ 25 ] ) . We do not know whether this is due to a true diﬀerence between the mouse and human proteins or to the experimental methods employed in the two laboratories , but K d values in the low micromolar range are similar to the literature values for other WH2 - containing proteins . Diﬀerences reported may possibly be due to the alternatively spliced MIM variant # 2003 Biochemical Society 469 Metastasis suppressor binds to actin and protein tyrosine phosphatase d Figure 5 Expression of MIM - B constructs in cells disrupts the actin cytoskeleton ( A ) Full - length myc - tagged MIM - B expressed in NIH3T3 cells and stained with anti - myc .

The minimal MIM - B fragment that bound to G - actin in the pulldown assay was 565 - 759MIM - B , while the much smaller 706 - 759MIM - B still showed actin monomer sequestering activity in the kinetics assays . This may be due to the GST - fusion interfering with actin monomer binding in the pulldown assays with short fragments , or it may be that the shorter fragments have a suﬃciently low aﬃnity for actin monomer that they are not retained during the washes of the pulldown experiment . In both experimental systems , the WH2 motif was necessary for actin binding and in the kinetic exper - iments , it was suﬃcient for monomer sequestration . While we do not yet know the function of the actin - binding activity of MIM - B , we can speculate that , like other WH2 proteins , MIM - B has at least three possible activities . First , it may be an actin - monomer - binding protein that regulates ﬁlament assembly , similar to thymosin } actobindin or cibolout . Thymosin and actobindin are thought to act as a simple actin monomer sequestering proteins , while cibolout enhances the assembly of actin monomers on the barbed ends of ﬁlaments [ 26 , 28 , 29 ] . Secondly , MIM - B may be a polarity - determining protein , similar to verprolin [ 7 , 8 ] . Finally , MIM - B may act as a scaﬀold protein to activate actin assembly similar to WASP - family proteins [ 2 ] . Giventhe interaction of MIM - Bwith RPTP d and theinduction of actin - rich protrusions upon overexpression of MIM - B , we favour the idea that it may be involved in polarity or actin assembly . The mechanism of induction of surface protrusions by MIM - B is unknown , but our immunolocalization studies suggest that it involves the Arp2 } 3 complex and actin . We speculate that MIM - B may be a part of a larger complex that induces actin assembly at the plasma membrane , similar to verprolin or WIP , which co - operate with WASP - family proteins to recruit Arp2 } 3 - complex - mediated actin assembly complexes . Further investi - gation into the regulation of MIM - B by small GTPases and possible interactions with WASP - family proteins or the Arp2 } 3 complex may reveal whether there is any connection . The loss of actin stress ﬁbres upon overexpression of MIM - B may be due to a re - direction of actin into surface protrusions , a loss of focal adhesion complexes , an inactivation of myosin - II or even a change in the composition } activation state of cell surface receptors . Fragments of WASP - family proteins when over - expressed cause an eventual loss of actin stress ﬁbres , as they re - direct much of the cellular F - actin into a diﬀuse cytoplasmic localization [ 30 ] . Alternatively , the interaction of MIM - B with RPTP d may change the tyrosine phosphorylation state of focal adhesion proteins and thus regulate the disassembly of integrin complexes , which would subsequently lead to stress ﬁbre dis - assembly . If MIM - B is involved in actin assembly at the plasma membrane , it may regulate the endocytosis or recycling of surface receptors , thus changing theactivation stateofintegrincomplexes via alterations in membrane traﬃcking . The membrane local - ization of the N - terminal portion of MIM - B suggests that this possibility warrants further investigation . Taken altogether , our study identiﬁes human MIM - B , a potential suppressor of metastasis , as an actin and RPTP d - binding protein that may link signalling and the cytoskeleton . Our data point to the idea that the mechanism of metastasis suppression by MIM may be via actin re - organization and } or changes in cell adhesion or tyrosine phosphorylation upon loss of MIM . Mouse MIM was identiﬁed by another group [ 25 ] to have similar actin - binding activities and to be widely distributed in mouse tissues , but highly expressed in developing neurons and myoblasts , suggesting a role in cell polarity . Future studies with MIM proteins will hopefully reveal how these newly identiﬁed WH2 - containing proteins control actin cytoskeletal assembly and how they may prevent the metastasis of cancer cells .
