Strikingly , at higher - stimulation not shown ) . Synj is present at low levels in the cytosol but is significantly enriched in the SV fraction , similar to frequency ( 10 Hz ) , the amplitude of the EJP measured from synj mutants rapidly declines to about 25 % – 30 % the subcellular distribution of Endo ( Figure 3K , a and b ; Fabian - Fine et al . , 2003 ) .

The average relative EJP amplitude during the last 150 s of the stimulation paradigm ( 450 – 600 s ) is shown in black bars . The modest decline in EJP amplitude in mutants is not significantly different from controls .

( E ) The level at which neurotransmitter release is maintained at 10 Hz in different synj mutants and in endo 1 was quantified by determining the average relative EJP amplitude between 150 and 450 s of stimulation . The EJP is maintained at 36 . 7 % of the original level in synj 2 / Df ( 2R ) R1 - 8 , at 28 . 9 % in synj 1 / synj 2 , at 29 . 0 % in synj 1 / Df ( 2R ) R1 - 8 , and at 20 . 0 % in endo 1 ( * p (cid:2) 0 . 01 ) .

The sorting of PRs into lamina cartridges is their localization is not dependent on Synj or Endo ( Fig - ures 9A – 9F ) .

We therefore conclude that Endo plays a pivotal role in maintaining and stabilizing proper levels Synj Promotes Vesicle Uncoating and Regulates Vesicle - Cytomatrix Interactions of Synj protein at synaptic terminals . To precisely determine the localization of the residual Our data indicate that Synj is essential for vesicle un - coating , in line with findings in mouse , C . elegans , and Synj in endo 1 mutant boutons , we double labeled endo 1 mutant animals with Synj antiserum and various mark - lamprey ( Cremona et al . , 1999 ; Gad , et al . , 2000 ; Harris etal . , 2000 ) . Synjuncoatsvesiclesbydephosphorylating ers . The vesicular marker CSP is mostly localized to the synaptic membrane in endo 1 mutants , and it often PI ( 4 , 5 ) P , thereby decreasing the affinity of clathrin adap - torstocoatedvesicles ( McPhersonetal . , 1996 ; Cremona concentrates in puncta , which likely represent AZs ( Ver - streken et al . , 2002 ) . Labeling of endo 1 boutons with CSP et al . , 1999 ) . PI ( 4 , 5 ) P is also implicated in organizing cy - toskeletal structure . Hence , by altering phosphoinositide andSynjshowsthatSynjpunctaaremostlyinterspersed between the CSP - positive puncta ( Figures 9M – 9P ) . Fur - levels , Synj may control cytoskeletal function at endocy - totic sites and regulate vesicle travel after fission ( Os - thermore , labeling of endo 1 boutons with Synj and the AZ marker glutamate receptor IIA ( Petersen et al . , 1997 ) borne et al . , 2001 ; Qualmann and Kessels , 2002 ) . In line with this idea , at synj mutant NMJs , we observe rows demonstrates that they do not colocalize ( Figures 9Q – 9T ) . Hence , we surmise that in the absence of Endo , the of vesicles apposed to non - AZ presynaptic membrane and these vesicles are regularly spaced , and in synj remaining Synj is localized to endocytotic hotspots .

Off transients or delayed off transients ( inset in D ) are marked by an arrowhead . Note the restoration of the off transient in flies with hypomorphic synj 2 mutant eyes that simultaneously overexpress Endo ( compare B to C ) . We used the EGUFhid system to overexpress Endo as the ey promoter drives GAL4 expression weakly and shuts off in the adult eye . This avoids morphological defects associated with massive overexpression of Endo ( e . g . , elav - GAL4 ; P . R . H . , unpublished data ) .

Scale bar equals 500 nm . mutant PR terminals , we observe clusters of densely and C . elegans synj mutants ( Harris et al . , 2000 ; Kim et al . , 2002 ) . Hence , in mouse , nematode , and flies , the coated and regularly spaced vesicles in multiple parallel rows , suggesting that these vesicles are associated with data suggest that Synj not only promotes vesicle un - coating , but that it also regulates cytoskeleton - vesicle the cytoskeleton . Similar arrays of coated vesicles , al - though less pronounced , were also reported in mouse interactions during endocytosis . Neuron744 Figure 9 .

Labeling in ( G ) and ( H ) was performed in the same tube and images were acquired using the Endophilin Recruits and Stabilizes Synaptojanin 745 Synj and Endo Are Required for a Late interaction with Endo . After vesicle fission , stabilized Synj catalyzes SV uncoating . The precise regulatory Endocytotic Step The biochemicalactivities ofSynj and Endosuggest that mechanisms that delay uncoating by Synj until after vesicle fission are unknown , but it is interesting to note these two proteins act at distinct steps in endocytosis . Endo is thought to alter membrane curvature , leading to that Synj undergoes dephosphorylation in response to persistent or high - frequency membrane depolarization deformation of the presynaptic membrane during early endocytosis ( Schmidt et al . , 1999 ) . If Endo and Synj act ( Cousin et al . , 2001 ) . However , it remains to be deter - mined whether this modification actually regulates Synj at distinct steps , we expect the individual mutants to display different phenotypes . However , at PR terminals function in vivo . with mutations in either endo or synj , we observe almost identical phenotypes , indicating that Synj and Endo Kiss - and - Run versus Clathrin - Mediated Endocytosis function are ultimately required at the same step in en - docytosis ( this work ; Fabian - Fine et al . , 2003 ) . Different modes of vesicle recycling exist at synapses ( Aravanis et al . , 2003 ; Kjaerulff et al . , 2002 ) . Our data Interestingly , C . elegans synj null synapses and hypo - morphic endo NMJs show early endocytotic intermedi - from endo 1 mutant NMJs indicate the existence of at least two different types of vesicle recycling ( Verstreken ates ( Guichet et al . , 2002 ; Harris et al . , 2000 ) . In addition , in Drosophila , the total vesicle number at synj 1 or endo 1 et al . , 2002 ) , and the data presented here are consistent with this idea . First , clear SVs are almost entirely de - NMJs is far lower than in controls , suggesting that Endo or Synj might also affect early endocytotic steps . How - pleted from synj 1 mutant NMJ boutons , but small vesicle clusters remain at AZs , suggesting that they undergo ever , synj 1 and endo 1 NMJs do show regularly spaced coated vesicles away from the AZs , suggesting that rapid recycling during stimulation . Second , by dis - rupting clathrin - mediated endocytosis , neurotransmit - Synj and Endo function is essential later in endocytosis . Similarly , at synj or endo mutant PR terminals , clusters ter release at synj and endo single or double mutant NMJs undergoes depression during intense stimulation of coated vesicles accumulate in large numbers , further supporting a late role in endocytosis . Hence , while we but is maintained at a stable level during low - frequency stimulation , in agreement with the observation that vesi - do not rule out a role for Synj or Endo during early endocytotic steps at some synapses , our data indicate cle recycling modes change with stimulation frequency ( Sun et al . , 2002 ) . Third , dye uptake during prolonged that both Synj and Endo are ultimately required for the uncoating of newly internalized SVs at both NMJs as stimulation is severely reduced in synj mutants ; note here that we have usedFM1 - 43 , which labels SVs under - well as PR terminals . going clathrin - mediated endocytosis but does not label SVs involved in kiss - and - run ( Klingauf et al . , 1998 ; Ver - Synj and Endo Are Functional Partners in Endocytosis streken et al . , 2002 ) . Fourth , ERG on / off transients re - corded from flies with synj 1 , synj 2 , or endo 1 single mutant In line with previous studies , we show here that in Dro - sophila , Synj and Endo bind to one another , even in the or double mutant eyes are absent or severely reduced , but the flies phototax normally , suggesting that some absence of SVs . In addition , we present data indicating that Synj and Endo are important for endocytosis at the vesicle recycling persists . In conclusion , the data are in agreement with and further support the idea that kiss - coatedvesiclestage , inagreementwithGadetal . ( 2000 ) , and we provide genetic evidence that Endo and Synj and - run maintains some neurotransmitter release when clathrin - mediated endocytosis is blocked or severely interact in vivo . Specifically , synj and endo single and impaired . Finally , labeling of endo 1 mutant boutons with double mutants display dramatically similar phenotypes anti - Synj and an AZ marker demonstrates that both in ultrastructural andfunctional assays , and overexpres - markersaremutually exclusive , indicatingthatkiss - and - sion of Endo in PRs partially alleviates the functional run , which operates at the AZ in endo 1 mutants , is spa - defects of a hypomorphic synj mutant , suggesting that tially separated from the area where clathrin - mediated Endo acts upstream of Synj . We also show that in endo 1 endocytosis occurs . It is worth mentioning that the kiss - nullmutants , Synjismislocalizedanddestabilized . Thus , and - run mode of release may also play an important role our data not only indicate that the functional interaction in mouse synapses that are depleted of synaptojanin - 1 , between Synj and Endo is important for vesicle uncoat - as they exhibit many of the features that we observe at ing , they also indicate that a key function of Endo is mutant NMJs and PR terminals ( Cremona et al . , 1999 ; to stabilize and localize Synj within the nerve terminal . Kim et al . , 2002 ) . Taken together , the data allow us to propose a model for the function of Endo and Synj in SV endocytosis .

( this issue of Neuron ) isolated C . elegans endophilin mutants and investigated the in vivo interaction between endophilin and synaptojanin . They found independently that a major role for endophilin is to serve as an adaptor for Synaptojanin , stabilizing its expression at the synapse , thereby promoting vesicle uncoating .
