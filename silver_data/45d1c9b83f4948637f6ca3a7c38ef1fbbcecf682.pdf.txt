McCullough and Rajni Sharma Additional information is available at the end of the chapter http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 5772 / 67779 Abstract Protective immune defences are dependent upon critical roles played by dendritic cells ( DCs ) , rendering them important targets for both vaccine delivery and virus infec - tion . Studies in these areas led to successful development of targeted vaccine delivery , including synthetic virus - like particle ( SVLP ) and nanoparticulate RNA vaccines . A major consideration is DC endocytosis , whereby the different endocytic routes influ - encing the outcome . Rapid clathrin - mediated endocytosis likely favours degradative pathways . Slower processes such as macropinocytosis , caveolar endocytosis and retro - grade transport to endoplasmic reticulum relate more to the processing rates leading to antigen presentation by DCs . These pathways are also influential in promoting the initiation of virus replication following infection . DC endocytosis of RNA viruses and RNA vaccines must lead to cytosolic translocation of the RNA for translation , relating to the process of antigen cross - presentation . One can learn from observations on both virus infections and cross - presentation for delivering RNA vaccines . Accordingly , recent advances in nanoparticulate delivery have been applied with self - amplifying replicon RNA ( RepRNA ) , providing efficient delivery to DCs and promoting replicon - encoded antigen translation . Through realising the important relationships between DC endocytic pathways and induction of immune responses , delivery of SVLP and RepRNA vaccines to DCs offers high value for the development of future synthetic vaccine platforms .

Introduction While protective immune defences are reliant upon robust antibody - mediated ( B - lymphocyte ) and concomitant T - lymphocyte response , their development is dependent on antigen deliv - ery leading to processing and presentation by dendritic cells ( DCs ) , a critical player for robust immune defence development , and therefore efficacious vaccination [ 1 – 9 ] . Induction of antibody ( humoral ) and cell - mediated immune ( CMI ) defences requires virus or vaccine interaction with the conventional DC ( cDC ) subsets , the ‘professional antigen presenting cells’ [ 3 , 6 – 12 ] ( Figure 1 ) . The manner by which these cDCs handle the antigen derived from an infection or vaccination defines the characteristics of adaptive immune defence develop - ment ( Figure 2 ) . Considering that many pathogen infections induce both humoral and CMI defences , vaccines inducing both arms of immune defence increase the potential for inducing robust immune defences . Accordingly , live attenuated vaccines should more closely mimic pathogen infection and therefore induce immune defence characteristics more related to convalescent immunity . Understanding the cell biological elements providing DCs with their functionality has been possible from studies on both effective convalescent immunity and that induced by efficacious vaccination . Whether the studies focussed on virus infection or efficacious vac - cine delivery , particular routes of endocytosis were observed to dominate . Through this , the power of DCs as the ‘professional antigen - presenting cell’ was determined [ 1 , 3 , 4 , 6 – 8 ] . Yet , most current vaccines are inactivated or subunit / split vaccines . Being non - replicative , only a limited amount of antigen can be provided , namely that within the vaccine dose , in contrast to the much greater antigen levels produced during infection and from a live vaccine . Such non - replicative vaccines induce more restricted immune defence characteristics , in terms of humoral versus CMI immunity and the robustness ( longevity ) of that immunity , than observed with convalescent immunity or that induced by a replicating vaccine . Of course , pathogen infection can induce undesirable clinical symptoms influencing the development of convalescent immune defence , which can be avoided by employing non - pathogenic replicating vaccines . Unfortunately , safe and efficacious live vaccines are not available for the majority of pathogens . Nonetheless , lessons can be learnt from convalescent immunity [ 9 , 13 ] . A major consideration is the capacity of replicating vaccines to mimic the pathogen infection such as producing several rounds of antigen production , increasing the effective antigen dose , involving different antigen - presentation pathways , promoting different arms of immune responses and thus increasing the efficacy of immune defence induction [ 9 ] . Resolution of this situation is showing promise from the more recent application of synthetic biology to create both synthetic virus - like particles ( SVLPs ) [ 14 – 16 ] and self - amplifying / rep - licating RNA ( replicon or RepRNA ) vaccines [ 9 , 13 , 17 – 20 ] , but also from advances in studies on virus infections . It has been observed that the majority of endocytosed material may well traverse rapid clathrin - mediated pathways , which is more likely favouring degradation of the internalised material [ 9 , 21 – 25 ] ( Figure 3 , pathway ( a ) ) . Slower kinetics of endocytosis would favour the processing required for a particular vaccine to prove efficacious or a virus to initiate its replication . Such outcomes are seen with macropinocytosis and caveolar endocytosis ( Figure 1 ; Figure 3 pathway ( b ) ) , as well as endocytosis into sorting endosomes for retrograde Biology of Myelomonocytic Cells 100 Figure 1 . Generalised overview of the two main cDC subsets—cDC1 and cDC2—following endocytosis of virus or vaccine ; processing pathways of endocytosed material leading into MHC Class I and MHC Class II presentation of the antigenic peptides to T - lymphocytes ; delivery of antigen to B - lymphocytes ; resultant initiation of antigen - specific immune defences and antibody production .

Further insight into the versatility of DC endocytic process has come from studies on initiation of RNA virus replication [ 25 ] . These have identified certain points of convergence with cross - pre - sentation of protein - based vaccines , and thus initiation of RNA vaccine translation of encoded antigens [ 9 ] . Importantly , both cross - presentation of antigen and initiation of endocytosed Figure 2 . DC subset interaction with different T - lymphocyte subsets . Following processing and presentation of the derived antigen peptides to antigen - specific T h - or T reg - lymphocytes , the patterns of cytokine communications are shown . These are important for defining the characteristics of the developing immune response . The endocytic processes involved are likely to be clathrin - independent endocytosis such as macropinocytosis , caveolar endocytosis or phagocytosis . Biology of Myelomonocytic Cells 102 RNA translation require DC endocytosis leading into cytosolic translocation . Endocytosis for cross - presentation delivers exogenous antigen via cytosolic translocation into pathways of polyubiquitination ; this directs processing by the immunoproteosome ( cross - presentation ) for presentation via major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) Class I ( Figure 1 , Figure 3 pathways Figure 3 . A schematic representation of the main endocytic processes functional within DCs in terms of processing internalised material for ( a ) degradation , ( b ) MHC Class II presentation , ( c ) MHC Class I presentation and ( d ) cytosolic release for cross - presentation via the immunoproteasome or translation of RepRNA vaccines . The lower portion of the image highlights certain aspects of endosomal release from endocytic vesicles during the early stages after acidification by interaction with early endosomes . Dendritic Cell Endocytosis Essential for Viruses and Vaccines http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 5772 / 67779 103 ( c ) and ( d ) ) [ 9 , 30 – 32 ] . Similarly , endocytosed vaccine RNA would be delivered by cytosolic translocation into the ribosomal translation sites within the cell for translation of the encoded vaccine antigens [ 9 , 25 ] . Cationic entities , particularly in a vaccine formulation , have been characterized for their capacity to promote endocytic vesicle perturbation towards cytosolic translocation [ 9 , 13 ] . Yet , there are other considerations . Initiation of a virus infectious process may involve the viral membrane ( with enveloped viruses ) or virus surface proteins ; thus , cytosolic translocation can be facilitated by membrane fusion and ‘flipping’ , or through formation of ion channels and elaborating membrane pores for delivery of the RNA genome [ 25 ] . Application of this knowledge has recently been employed with synthetic biodegradable nanoparticulate vehi - cles for enhancing delivery of self - amplifying / replicating RepRNA vaccines to DCs [ 9 , 13 , 17 – 20 , 33 – 35 ] ( Figure 3 pathway ( d ) ) . Whilst success with this approach has been forthcoming with mRNA vaccine delivery to DCs [ 9 , 36 , 37 ] , delivery of the larger replicon RepRNA mol - ecules has required additional considerations . This may be due to the likely increased com - paction of these larger RNA molecules by the delivery vehicle , but other events important to the virus genome from which RepRNA is derived must be considered , including the role of cellular micro - RNAs ( miRNA ) and divalent cations . Nonetheless , nanoparticulate delivery technology has been adapted to deliver RepRNA to DCs ( see below ) , leading to promotion of the replicon - encoded antigen translation in vitro and in vivo [ 13 , 17 – 20 , 33 , 34 ] . The work identified important relationships between the DC endocytic pathways and ultimate induc - tion of immune responses by the nanoparticle - delivered RepRNA , relating to characteristics observed following virus infection . 2 . Dendritic cells : sentinels of immune defence Dendritic cell ( DC ) subsets are found in many sites of the body , which determines their roles in developing and regulating immune defences ( Figure 4 ) [ 1 – 12 ] . Together with MΦ , tissue and mucosal DCs are in the front line for encounter with and response to a virus or vaccine . These ‘local’ DCs and MΦ initiate the inflammatory response recruiting additional DCs together with monocytes , differentiating into DCs and MΦ , to augment local cell activ - ity ( Figure 4 ) . Both the receptor repertoire and the endocytic processes employed by DCs and MΦ are closely related . Nonetheless , major distinctions exist , notably the recruitment of lysosomal proteases to the acidifying endocytic pathways is observed earlier and at higher levels in MΦ compared with DCs [ 38 ] . Dendritic cells are the central players for effective convalescent immunity , efficacious vaccination and maintenance of tolerance ( Figure 2 ; Figure 4 ) [ 1 , 3 , 4 , 6 – 8 ] . They are capable of both MHC Class II presentation ( Figure 1 ; Figure 2 ) , MHC Class I presentation , cross - presentation ( Figure 1 ) [ 30 , 32 , 39 – 43 ] and antigen delivery to B lymphocytes ( Figure 1 ) [ 44 , 45 ] , as well as regulating immune responsiveness and immune tolerance ( Figure 2 ; Figure 4 ) [ 6 , 46 – 53 ] . Therein lie two important aspects of DC biology—their high capacity for endocytosis together with the diverse network of routes employed ( Figure 3 ) and different subsets tend Biology of Myelomonocytic Cells 104 to dominate particular processes [ 3 – 5 , 9 , 12 , 21 – 23 , 54 – 56 ] . Although particular endocytic routes may dominate under certain interactions between DCs and virus or vaccine , more than one endocytic route will often be involved [ 9 , 22 , 56 ] . Indeed , using SVLP vaccines [ 14 , 15 ] , multiple endocytic routes have been identified . While macropinocytosis played a major role , additional endocytic routes were operative , as observed with mature DCs no longer employing macropinocytic activity [ 14 ] . Figure 4 . Dendritic cell subsets can be defined with respect to their sites of ‘residence’ in the body , wherein they act as sentinels for sampling the environment , to maintain tolerance and respond to ‘foreign’ material posing a ‘danger’ to the host . This is particularly notable at mucosal surfaces for controlling local tolerance through anti - inflammatory processes , while ensuring responsiveness against pathogenic entities and mucosal vaccines . Dendritic Cell Endocytosis Essential for Viruses and Vaccines http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 5772 / 67779 105 3 . Application of multiple endocytic pathways Combining studies on both virus infection of and vaccine delivery to DCs have led to the creation of new vaccine formulations , such as SVLP vaccines [ 14 , 15 ] and the self - amplifying RepRNA vaccines [ 9 , 17 – 19 , 33 ] . While clathrin - mediated endocytosis has often been implicated with both virus infection and vaccine delivery [ 9 , 22 , 25 , 55 – 57 ] , the rapidity of the process and levels of enzymatic activity therein would favour a more degradative pathway , rather than one promoting antigen processing or RNA - release for translation . Certainly , rapid clathrin - medi - ated endocytosis would create a detrimental environment to the survival of both RNA viruses and RNA vaccines ( Figure 3 , pathway ( a ) ) . Accordingly , antigen must be processed to reach either the MHC Class I or MHC Class II assembly sites for appropriate antigen presentation ( Figure 3 , pathways ( b ) , to ( d ) ) ; RNA must be processed to reach the ribosomal translation machinery . Both exogenous antigen and RNA must avoid the degradative capacities of the late endosomes and , in particular , the lysosomes . Antigen being processed through the maturing endosomal system has to target the MHC Class II compartment ( MIIC ) , for MHC Class II presentation , providing processing rather than degradation by lysosomes . With MHC Class I presentation , endocytosed exog - enous antigen has to transfer from the endocytic pathway to the cytosol—cytosolic translo - cation . This facilitates the cross - presentation processing pathway via immunoproteasomes . An important characteristic is that the cytosolic translocation must be effected at a relatively early stage of endosome - mediated acidification of endocytic vesicles ( see below ) . As for RNA , from viruses or vaccines , the cytosolic transfer for translation has to occur before the maturing endosomal system becomes too degradative ; that is viral RNA genomes and RNA vaccines must escape the maturing endosomal system while still capable of translating [ 9 , 38 , 40 , 43 , 58 ] . While these differential processing pathways of DCs are important for ensuring efficient provision of antigen in the correct form for immune defence development , an additional pro - cess is essential , namely , endocytosis leading into ‘danger’ signalling . From within the endo - somal system , this involves toll - like receptor ( TLR ) - containing endosome - like structures , which in turn are unlikely to provide antigen presentation and certainly detrimental to RNA release for translation . Following cytosolic translocation of RNA , danger signalling can be effected through cytosolic detectors such as the retinoic acid - inducible gene - I ( RIG - I ) fam - ily of helicases ( see below ) . Accordingly , DCs employ different endocytic mechanisms and pathways to ensure correct processing of antigen , appropriate cytosolic translocation for cross - presentation , cytosolic translocation of RNA for translation , and appropriate delivery of anti - gen - based or RNA - based entities to the ‘danger’ signalling pathways . 4 . Dendritic cell sensing With DCs being an important sentinel of the immune system , the receptors on these cells play critical roles in different aspects of host environment surveillance ( Figure 5 ) . On the one side , Biology of Myelomonocytic Cells 106 particular DC receptors are more involved in pathogen or vaccine uptake . In addition to this , DC handling of material ‘foreign’ to the host can lead to ‘danger’ recognition , which effec - tively determines immune activation as opposed to tolerance induction . Dendritic cell pattern recognition receptors ( PRRs ) recognise pathogen - associated or danger - associated molecular patterns ( PAMPs and DAMPs ) , playing major roles in this recognition and ultimate signalling of the DCs . Dendritic cell receptor ligation determines the manner by which DCs endocytose and the out - come of the DC activity . One important consequence of ligating certain receptors is the induction of inflammatory reactions ( see Figure 2 and Figure 4 ) , the characteristics of which relate to the receptors involved [ 5 , 59 , 60 ] . While PRRs such as toll - like receptors ( TLRs ) , complement receptors and mannose - binding receptors ( Figure 5 ) are important for inflam - matory responses , both these and other receptors including other C - type lectins , integrins and CD44 can enhance ‘foreign’ material binding to and internalisation by the cells into endocytic processing pathways [ 5 , 9 , 61 – 63 ] . For example , ligation of TLRs , siglecs , galectins and CD14 can promote antigen uptake as well as activating innate defence processes , either alone or in co - operation with C - type lectins or integrins [ 9 , 64 , 65 ] . Moreover , different DC receptors can promote uptake into different endocytic pathways . For example , cholera toxin may be targeted to caveolar endocytic pathways and the ER , whereas autocrine mobility factor associ - ates more with the ER [ 66 ] . While simian virus 40 ( SV40 ) also targets to the ER , both this and cholera toxin are observed in recycling endosomes prior to retrograde transport into the Golgi and ER [ 26 – 29 ] . In addition to DC sensing their environment via cell surface PRRs such as TLR2 heterodimers and TLR4 , endocytosed material can also be sensed . Vesicular TLR2 can detect lipopeptides Figure 5 . Examples of known DC receptors , demonstrating their wide range of capacities for sampling the host environment . These receptors also offer the potential for targeting vaccines to DC , particularly with the new synthetic vaccines employing nanoparticulate delivery vehicles . Dendritic Cell Endocytosis Essential for Viruses and Vaccines http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 5772 / 67779 107 buried deep within bacterial cell walls following endosomal degradation of the latter to expose the lipopeptides . This was proven using SVLPs carrying TLR2 ligands within their hydrophobic cores [ 15 ] . By employing such SVLPs , there was no influence of interaction with cell surface TLR2 heterodimers , as is the case with bacteria and yeast particles through the lipoteichoic acid and peptidoglycan moieties in their cell walls . Additional intracellular PRRs are also involved in detecting ‘foreign’ RNA—vesicular TLR3 and TLR7 , and cytosolic sensors including helicases [ 67 – 69 ] . RNA sensing is an important issue for RNA virus infection and RNA vaccine delivery . Pathogen - associated molecular patterns ( PAMPs ) associated with ‘foreign’ RNA are generally formed through RNA modi - fications or secondary structures not normally found within the cells . TLR3 and TLR7 can respond to dsRNA and ssRNA structures on the ‘foreign’ RNA , respectively , such PRR activity being linked with processing via the endosomal system . Yet the RNA associated with RNA virus infections as well as with delivery of RNA vaccine can be translocated to the cytosol through action of the virus or vaccine particles ( see below ) . Under these conditions , cytosolic sensors become important for detecting RNA - associated PAMPs . 5 . Cytosolic PRR activity Cytosolic helicases can detect RNA translocated to the cytosol from vesicular structures . The cytosolic helicases of the RIG - I - like receptors ( RLRs ) family recognise RNA - associated PAMPs through their helicase domain and C - terminal repressor domain ( RD ) ; the conse - quential triggering of intracellular signalling cascades is effected via the caspase - recruitment ( CARD ) domains [ 70 ] . As with the RNA - sensing TLRs , RLRs can recognise PAMPs associated with either ssRNA or dsRNA . The latter come from the dsRNA intermediates derived from replicating viral genomic RNA or RepRNA ; single - stranded RNA molecules can also form double - stranded sequences during the hairpin - folding for their secondary structures , the length of which will determine their detection as PAMPs [ 71 ] . In addition to such structures , RNA bearing a 5’ - triphosphate will also be sensed by helicases . Within the RLR family , RIG - I responds to both short dsRNA sequences and ssRNA bearing a 5’ - triphosphate ; MDA - 5 responds more to long dsRNA [ 70 ] . 5’ - triphosphate structures are often required by positive - strand RNA viruses ( termed ‘positive strand’ due to the capac - ity of the viral genome to function as an mRNA ) to ensure ribosomal entry for translation . During the replication of RNA viruses and RepRNA , dsRNA ‘replicative intermediates’ are formed to generate progeny ssRNA ( hence the ‘self - amplifying term associated with RepRNA vaccines ) . Thus , DCs endocytosing RNA viruses or vaccines capable of self - amplification would respond to dsRNA replicative intermediates , in addition to the double stranded secondary structures in the endocytosed RNA , and 5’ - triphosphate if present . This ‘danger’ sensing of RNA structures provides a good example of the divergence displayed by different DC subsets , and the influence on the cytokine profiles induced . Plasmacytoid DCs ( pDCs ) tend more to use TLR3 and TLR7 sensing ; other cells will employ the cytosolic sensors of RLRs and oligomerization domain ( NOD ) - like receptors ( NLRs ) , which also respond to Biology of Myelomonocytic Cells 108 dsRNA structures [ 70 ] . While RLR - and TLR - mediated activation leads to type I interferon and pro - inflammatory cytokine production , dependent on the DC type , NLR - mediated activation favours IL - 1β induction ; it is also important to note that dsRNA sensing by NLRs is involved in the regulation of the induced responses [ 70 ] . Thus , ‘danger’ recognition can lead to particular cytokine profiles dependent on the sensing receptor and DC subset involved . The pDC sensing of RNA by TLR3 and TLR7 ( and DNA by TLR8 / 9 ) leads to the production of notably high levels of IFN - α and TNF , particularly in response to infection . In addition to their anti - viral properties , these cytokines provide the necessary signals to promote appropriate cDC maturation , essential for ensuring that anti - gen presentation to lymphocytes promotes the development of an antigen - specific adaptive immune response . However , induction of cytokine production by DCs , cDCs and pDCs , will not always prove beneficial in promoting effective immune defence . For example , viruses such as influenza virus and haemorrhagic disease viruses can induce excessive levels of IFN - α and other inflammatory cytokines , leading to the so - called cytokine storm and subsequent immunopathological problems [ 72 – 75 ] . Even viruses not renowned for inducing such events can be prove troublesome . For example , foot - and mouth disease virus infection in pigs can increase IL - 10 production by DCs , with a consequential negative influence on antigen pre - sentation and T - lymphocyte activation ; in contrast , immune complexes with foot and mouth disease virus are potent inducers of IFN - α by pDCs [ 76 , 77 ] . Such studies on virus infection of DCs have helped to define conditions beneficial for the host , and therefore what is required for efficacious vaccination . Dendritic cell cytokine induction is certainly critical for inducing maturation of cDCs , an essential requirement for both migration into lymph nodes and efficient presentation of antigen leading to activation of T - lymphocyte responses [ 2 , 7 , 10 , 62 ] . Overall , one should consider that targeting slower endocytic processing pathways rather than targeting the more rapid and degradative path - ways would prove crucial . 6 . Comparative endocytic processes within DCs The aforementioned differences between MΦ and DCs give an important insight into the characteristics of endocytic processing . Dendritic cells degrade endocytosed material at slower rates , with an overall less acidic phagosomal / endosomal pH than MΦ [ 38 ] . These characteristics relate to the different biological roles of the two cell types . On the one hand , DCs are more important for processing and delivering antigen to activate lymphocyte responses . Conversely , MΦ play a more significant role in innate immune cell defence , notably pertinent in the removal and destruction of infectious pathogens , as well as entities present - ing a danger to the host , such as damaged or dying cells . Nonetheless , these roles are neither absolute nor mutually exclusive ; DCs and MΦ interact during inflammatory responses and the recruitment of cells , including additional DCs , MΦ , T - lymphocytes and NK cells . The slower endocytic processes noted with DCs would certainly be favourable for efficient anti - gen processing leading to presentation , as well as cytosolic translocation for cross - presentation Dendritic Cell Endocytosis Essential for Viruses and Vaccines http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 5772 / 67779 109 or facilitating RNA translation ( see Figure 3 ) . Yet , despite the difference in the cellular compo - nents and the rate of endocytic processing , both clathrin - dependent and clathrin - independent pathways show a major relationship . Although some employ dynamin while other pathways are dynamin - independent [ 21 – 23 , 78 – 80 ] , both processing pathways can lead to interaction with early endosomes ( Figure 3 ) . This provides acidification by vacuolar H + - ATPase activity and enzyme - mediated degradation within the endocytic vesicle . The important difference between the rapid clathrin - dependent endocytosis and slower clathrin - independent routes is the rate at which endosomal interaction and acidification occur [ 21 – 23 , 55 – 57 ] . The clathrin - independent endocytic processes , such as macropinocytosis , lipid raft - dependent and caveo - lae - mediated endocytosis , are notably active with DCs , facilitating processing of antigen for presentation via MHC Class II [ 9 , 23 , 54 , 56 , 57 ] . Moreover , slower processes support reten - tion of endocytosed material at the earlier stages of endosomal maturation in DCs for longer periods , increasing the potential for cytosolic translocation . Nonetheless , clathrin - dependent endocytic processes have been employed by viruses to promote initiation of their infectious cycle . Ebola virus , coronaviruses and certain mammalian reoviruses employ clathrin - dependent endocytosis for their infections [ 81 ] . Other viruses , such as influenza virus , employ both clathrin - dependent [ 82 ] and clathrin - independent pathways , the latter proving also caveo - lin - independent . Certain bacterial toxins are also endocytosed by clathrin - dependent and clathrin - independent pathways [ 26 – 28 , 83 – 85 ] . 6 . 1 . Macropinocytosis in dendritic cells The clathrin - independent macropinocytosis relates to clathrin - dependent endocytosis in concentrating receptors upon internalisation , although macropinosomes are more heteroge - neous in size—up to 5 μm diameter . The function of macropinocytosis also impacts strongly on DCs in their role of antigen processing for presentation to the adaptive immune system . Both DCs and MΦ employ macropinocytosis more efficiently than other cells [ 86 ] , through their application of aquaporin channels to sample the environment [ 87 ] , exhibiting fluid phase uptake up to 40 % of their cell volume [ 88 ] . Macropinocytic activity is also important with respect to the aforementioned maturation of DCs which is essential for efficient antigen presentation to T - lymphocytes . Aquaporins are down - regulated in mature DCs , relating to the observed reduction in macropinocytosis [ 87 ] . In contrast , maturation of DCs does not affect other receptor - mediated endocytosis processes . The fate of macropinosomes is also particular to DCs and MΦ , wherein macropinosomes fuse with early endosomes soon after formation ( Figure 3 ) . Macropinosomes acquire Rab7 , exchanging their membrane content with late endosomes as they are transported to a more perinuclear area [ 89 ] . This contrasts with non - immune cells , such as epithelial and fibroblas - tic cells , wherein macropinosomes tend to remain more isolated from endosomes and lyso - somes , fusing back with the plasma membrane to release their content into the extracellular space [ 90 , 91 ] . Clearly , macropinocytosis is an important component for facilitating antigen capture by DCs and MΦ . In the context of antigen processing and presentation , the macropinocy - tosed antigens are observed in endocytic vesicles and macropinosome - like structures rich Biology of Myelomonocytic Cells 110 in MHC Class II molecules ( Figure 3 , pathway ( b ) ) [ 88 , 92 ] . Antigens endocytosed via macropinocytosis can also be presented on MHC Class I molecules—the cross - presentation pathway following antigen translocation to the cytosol for processing via the immuno - proteosome ( Figure 3 , pathway ( c ) ) [ 93 ] . Yet , DCs employ other endocytic pathways in addition to macropinocytosis ( Figure 3 ) . Caveolin - dependent endocytosis is important , as is lipid raft - mediated endocytosis , although the latter can be associated with both mac - ropinocytosis and caveolar endocytosis . Clathrin - independent endocytosis routes in the absence of caveolin may become solely dependent on lipid rafts for intracellular trafficking . 6 . 2 . Processing macropinosomes and other endocytic processes Following the endocytosis , early endosomes associating with endocytic vesicles are considered key players for cargo sorting ( see Figure 3 ) . An important bifurcation of endocytic pathways occurs at this stage , channelling into Rab11 + recycling endosomes or into intra - luminal vesi - cles of multi - vesicular endosomes ( MVEs ; or MVBs for multi - vesicular bodies ) . Via these lat - ter structures , processing will ultimately lead into late endosomes and lysosomes . Many late endosomes are involved in the degradative pathway resulting in association of lysosomes and degradation of the cargo , but a late endosome - related structure is essential for MHC Class II presentation—the MHC Class II compartment ( MIIC ) . Late endosomes may also be associated with transfer into vesicular structures carrying the internal TLRs . Moreover , the channelling of endocytosed antigen in a relatively intact form for delivery to B - lymphocytes employs late endosome - like structures [ 44 , 45 ] . Not only macropinocytosis , but also caveolin - dependent endocytosis crosstalk with classical endosomal components [ 94 ] , including fusion with Rab11 + recycling endosomes—caveolin + caveosomes are also seen to be sorted from endosomal com - partments [ 95 ] . Caveolar endocytosis has been noted with particular entities interacting with cells , includ - ing albumin [ 96 ] , tetanus toxin [ 97 ] , cholera toxin [ 98 ] and both polyomavirus and SV40 [ 99 ] . The uptake of cholera toxin [ 100 ] is particularly noteworthy , considering the involve - ment of the recycling endosomes with caveolar endocytosis . The B subunit of the toxin is responsible for cell entry following binding to the monosialotetrahexosylganglioside ( GM1 ) found in lipid rafts and caveolae . Although the CTB subunit can associate with clathrin - dependent endocytic vesicles and clathrin - coated pits [ 101 ] , and inhibition of clathrin - mediated endocytosis reduces cholera toxin internalisation [ 98 , 102 ] , the toxin activity it is not dependent on clathrin - dependent endocytosis [ 102 ] . For this , the cholera toxin must be delivered into Golgi complex , which requires retrograde transport from the recycling endosomes ( Figure 3 ) [ 26 – 28 ] . In fact cholera toxin can be endocytosed by differ - ent routes , but is ultimately delivered from recycling endosomes to Golgi complex via a clathrin - independent pathway [ 100 , 103 ] , as is shiga toxin [ 104 ] . It is also likely that viruses such as polyomavirus and SV40 may require similar routes of entry [ 105 ] . Overall , the important lesson from these studies is the capacity of DCs to employ different endocytic routes , some particular to certain antigenic materials , and others being employed in com - bination . Whether the DCs employ a particular endocytic pathway or a number of different routes , the outcome is dependent on the pathway employed and therefore influences how the DCs handle the endocytosed cargo . Dendritic Cell Endocytosis Essential for Viruses and Vaccines http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 5772 / 67779 111 7 . Cytosolic translocation in dendritic cells As mentioned above , retrograde transport from recycling endosomes into the Golgi and ER ( see Figure 3 ) is an important pathway for the B subunit of cholera and shiga toxins to promote cytosolic translocation of the A subunit [ 26 – 28 ] . Polyomavirus and SV40 also translo - cate from the ER for initiation of their replicative cycle [ 105 ] . These pathways can be employed by DCs for the cytosolic translocation leading to cross - presentation of exogenous antigen . Following the retrograde pathway , cytosolic translocation is likely dependent on protein - protein interactions facilitating entry into the cytosol , as observed with the mechanisms employed by cholera and shiga toxins and members of the polyomaviridae . Association of ER membranes with endocytic vesicles can insert the ER dislocon , leading to antigen associated with ER - like structures and subsequent entry into cross - presentation pathways [ 39 , 43 ] . Yet , DCs can also employ non - retrograde pathways – relatively slow clathrin - dependent endo - cytosis or the clathrin - independent macropinocytosis – for cytosolic translocation leading into the cross - presentation pathways . This cytosolic translocation displays distinctive characteristics dependent on which of the endocytic routes is employed , but requires interaction with early endosomes . The neutral pH environment of the ER and proteolytic activity therein is clearly distinctive from the events associated with clathrin - dependent and clathrin - independent endo - cytosis involving endosomal interactions . With the latter , the early endosomes provide mem - brane vacuolar H + - ATPases promoting acidification of the endocytic vesicles , an essential event for facilitating cytosolic translocation from these arms of the endocytic processing pathways . An important influence on the outcome of endocytic vesicles interacting with early endosomes is the role of cationic elements within virus particles or vaccine delivery vehicles . Cationic entities , associated with peptide , lipid or saccharide structures can provide what has been referred to as the ‘proton sponge’ or ‘pH - buffering’ effect ( Figure 3 , pathway ( d ) ) [ 106 , 107 ] . The vacuolar H + - ATPase activity from early endosomes pumps protons into the endocytic vesicle leading to this proton sponge effect . For example , protonable amines behave as buff - ering agents by readily accepting protonation [ 108 ] . Histidine - and arginine - rich molecules , as well as histidine residues , can also initiate the proton sponge effect through protonation of imidazole rings [ 106 , 107 ] . By increasing ion and water uptake into the endocytic vesicles , the protonation events increase osmotic pressure leading to vesicular swelling and membrane destabilisation , allowing cytosolic release of the vesicle contents . However , disruption of the endocytic vesicles would prove a relatively destructive process , and are not ideal for the intra - cellular environment . A more physiologically appropriate process can be seen when analysing histidine - and arginine - rich peptides and polymers , with which cytosolic translocation can be promoted through interaction with the anionic vesicular membrane [ 107 ] . This is particularly notable with amphiphilic peptides . Binding at the edge of membrane pores can reduce inter - nal membrane tension , while insertion into the vesicular membrane can reduce chain length to create internal membrane tension [ 106 , 109 ] . Cationic lipids will also influence cytosolic translocation by ionic paring with phosphatidylserine in endocytic vesicle membrane [ 110 ] . This promotes electrostatic interactions and decreases membrane curvature , potentially with conversion from a lamellar to a non - lamellar phase . Biology of Myelomonocytic Cells 112 Regardless of which endocytosis pathway is employed by the DC to process internalised cargo , the outcome will be either destruction or processing . For the latter , this can lead through the maturing endosomal system for MHC Class II presentation , or can involve one of the pathways of cytosolic translocation for MHC Class I presentation . With RNA viruses and RNA vaccines , the latter pathways would be more favourable , promoting delivery of the RNA to the ribosomal translation machinery . In the case of RNA vaccines , this translation would provide the antigens for direction into the immunoproteosome from the ER , or prob - ably via autophagy into the endosomal system for delivery to the MIIC . 8 . Dendritic cell endocytosis leading to MHC Class I or MHC Class II presentation As mentioned above , MΦ with DCs employ common endocytic processes for ultimately distinctive outcomes [ 38 ] . While MΦ rapidly recruit and activate lysosomal proteases , leading to rapid degradation of endocytic cargo , the lower acidic endosomal pH and slower acidifying process within DCs favour slower degradation of internalized cargoes . DCs also generate reactive oxygen species in endocytic compartments through the activated NOX2 subunit of NADPH - oxidase , which in turn consume protons and modulate the pH . This rate of endosomal acidification is important for the consequences of the processing pathway , and therefore both directing into the MIIC and cytosolic translocation . Although acidification of the endosomal structures is a characteristic of the so - called endosomal maturation leading into the more destructive late endosomes and lysosomes , the early stages of the endosomal acidification play particularly essential roles for cytosolic translo - cation from the endosomal compartment . Therefore , a more ‘regulated’ ( in terms of rate ) endosomal acidification would facilitate the processing events leading to MHC Class I and MHC Class II presentation . Importantly however , once the acidification falls below a certain pH , the potential for translocation to the cytosol becomes less likely , and the endo - somal structures become ‘cross - presentation incompetent’ [ 38 ] . This situation relates to the concomitant decrease of pH and ER - derived proteins , with increased proteolytic activity . It is now clear that exogenous antigen can be processed into the MHC Class I pathway via ‘cross - presentation’ pathways [ 40 , 43 , 57 , 58 , 111 ] which is important for activating the Tc lymphocytes of cytotoxic CMI ( see Figure 1 ) . Consideration of these characteristics has also proven valuable for understanding the requirement of endocytosed RNA and RNA viruses for cytosolic translocation ( see Figure 3 , pathway ( d ) ) . Moreover , the division of labour associated with different DC subsets is an important consideration when cytosolic translocation is required . Participation of different DC receptors leading to endocytosis is influential , defining the form of endocytosis and relative role played by retrograde transport into the ER [ 43 ] . When the receptor and endocytic targeting deliver into early compartments such as recy - cling endosomes , both MHC Class I and Class II presentation can ensue ; delivery into and interaction with later endosomal compartments lead to a domination of MHC Class II pre - sentation [ 38 , 112 ] . Yet , transport of the endocytosed material down a particular pathway Dendritic Cell Endocytosis Essential for Viruses and Vaccines http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 5772 / 67779 113 favouring MHC Class I or MHC Class II processing is not absolute . For example , material being transported towards an MHC Class I presentation pathway can be transferred into autophagic vesicles for delivery into the MHC Class II presentation pathway . Overall , it can be considered that processing antigen for association with MHC Class I molecules is a less acidic process compared with the pathway leading to MHC Class II presentation . A good example of this is the aforementioned relative neutral pH of the retrograde pathway though the ER . Another example is seen with cytosolic translocation from early endosomal structures . The initial lowering of endocytic vesicle pH is important , but as mentioned above this is limited by the ‘point of no return’ within the acidifying endosomal compartment , beyond which the conditions render translocation less likely [ 38 , 43 , 113 ] . Therefore , cytosolic translocation must arise before the more degradative processes of the late endosomes have taken charge . As mentioned above , not only antigen , but also viruses employ different endocytic pathways to initiate their replicative cycles . While polyomaviruses and SV40 translocate from the ER for this purpose , numerous other viruses require the acidifying endosomal system to initi - ate their replication . The endosomes provide pH - dependent modifications of viral surface proteins . By such means , endosomal membrane modulation is promoted leading to cytosolic release of the viral genome ; in the case of positive strand RNA viruses , the genome func - tions as a mRNA by interacting directly with the cellular translation machinery ; in the case of negative strand viruses , the viral genome is associated with the nucleocapsid carrying the polymerase , the polymerase generating the ‘positive strand’ to function as an mRNA . Endosomal membrane modulation can result from fusion between the endosomal and viral membranes , as with influenza virus , or re - arrangement of viral proteins to form ion channels and pores in the endosomal membrane , as with picornaviruses and flaviviruses [ 25 ] . Related to the former ( endosomal membrane fusion ) , is the work with fusogenic peptides , leading to vesicular membrane destabilisation as the internal pH decreases below 6 . 0 [ 107 , 109 ] . These studies on the processes employed by viruses to promote cytosolic translocation have proven useful in the development of processes for the successful delivery of RNA vaccines . In this context , the delivery of self - amplifying replicon RNA is of particular interest , due to its high potential for vaccine development in the future [ 9 , 13 , 17 – 19 , 35 , 114 ] . However , these large RNA molecules have particular requirements , which are more stringent or more obligatory than with smaller RNA molecules such as the oligonucleotides of siRNA and mRNA vaccines . 9 . Self - amplifying RNA interaction with dendritic cells Interest in the development of replicating RNA vaccines has increased during the past two decades , notably in the field of self - amplifying RepRNA technology [ 9 , 13 , 18 , 114 – 118 ] . RepRNA are basically viral genomes lacking at least one gene encoding structural proteins , but retaining the genes encoding the viral polymerase ( self - amplification / replication ) complex ( Figure 6 ) , hence termed as ‘replicon’ . This type of construct permits replication of RNA without the risk of progeny virus production and therefore disease ; the vaccine element is Biology of Myelomonocytic Cells 114 introduced by inserting genes encoding vaccine antigens of interest ( ‘genes of interest’ or GOI ) into the constructs ( Figure 6 ) [ 9 , 13 , 18 , 20 , 114 – 121 ] . Development of this technology during the past two decades focussed on packaging the RNA in a virus - like particle or the virus replicon particle ( VRP ) [ 9 , 115 – 117 ] . However , this approach can encounter particu - lar problems such as host immunity against the viral proteins composing the VRP surface structure ; production difficulties / expense may also prove an encumbrance due to the require - ment for complementing cell lines providing the gene products missing from the replicon so that VRPs will be generated [ 9 ] . Replacement of the VRP by biodegradable delivery vehicles would facilitate vaccine production ( obviating the need for complementing cells lines ) , avoid problems of the host immune system neutralising the VRP antigens , and permit more con - trollable targeting of DCs [ 9 ] . This approach was first reported in 2008 ( Figure 7 ) [ 20 ] , with Figure 6 . Generation of self - amplifying RepRNA vaccines derived from the CSFV genome , for application with biodegradable nanoparticulate delivery vehicles to target DCs by nanoparticulate vehicles . Two examples are shown : ∆E rns replicon lacking a single ( E rns ) gene , and C - Igκss - p7 replicon lacking all three structural glycoproteins . NotI endonuclease restriction sites , introduced to facilitate insertion of genes encoding vaccine antigen , are shown at the 3’ end of the N pro leader autoprotease as N * . The site for insertion of the gene of interest ( GOI ) encoding the vaccine antigen is shown as the hashed box . An additional insertion , an EMCV IRES , is employed to restart the translation which terminates after the GOI . Dendritic Cell Endocytosis Essential for Viruses and Vaccines http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 5772 / 67779 115 Figure 7 . Nanoparticulate delivery of self - amplifying RNA vaccines derived from the CSFV RepRNA . The nanoparticulate delivery vehicle is designed to promote efficient uptake into endocytic vesicles , in which the RepRNA is seen to accumulate . Thereafter , a gradual cytosolic translocation of the RepRNA is observed—essential for RNA delivery to the intracellular site for translation . Thereby , the RepRNA efficiently translates the encoded vaccine antigen of interest , as well as the polymerase complex for replication of the RNA . Insertion of an internal ribosomal entry site ( IRES ) from EMC virus ensures that translation of the polymerase complex resumes after translation of the vaccine antigen . Biology of Myelomonocytic Cells 116 increasing evidence of the potential for this methodology forthcoming in more recent years [ 9 , 13 , 17 – 19 , 33 – 35 , 114 , 122 ] . RepRNA show the characteristics of the parent virus genome , providing several rounds of replication to increase the number of RNA templates available for translation . By such means , the antigen dosages available for activating humoral immunity and cytotoxic cell - mediated immunity ( CMI ) , as well as the duration of that availability , are enhanced beyond that pos - sible with a more conventional inactivated vaccine approach ( Figure 8 ) [ 9 , 13 , 17 , 18 , 20 , 114 ] . Moreover , being replicative in nature enhances their capacity to induce CMI as well as humoral immunity , a characteristic often lacking with inactivated vaccines . Live , attenuated vaccines offer the same advantage due to their replicative nature . A major benefit of RepRNA vaccines is that they do not suffer from the potential risk of reversion to virulence posed by attenuated vaccines , due to their defective nature being unable to produce progeny viruses ( Figure 6 ) . Many studies , primarily using VRPs , have employed alphaviruses [ 115 – 117 ] . However , these viruses and the derived RepRNA are cytopathogenic , killing their host cells . The slow pro - cessing and retention of antigen typical of DC functionality with respect to inducing robust immune defences would not be favoured by cell death from a cytopathogenic RepRNA , despite their rapid production of antigen . Although delivery of such replicons to epithelial cells would provide antigen indirectly for the DCs , targeting DCs with cytopathogenic repli - cons is probably not the most effective of approaches . On the other hand , non - cytopathogenic RepRNA vaccines , such as those derived from classical swine fever virus ( CSFV ) ( Figure 6 ) [ 20 , 118 ] , would have higher potential for targeting DCs with the aim of prolonged presence of antigen in these cells ( Figure 7 ) . While non - cytopathogenic RepRNA should translate anti - gen slower than cytopathogenic replicons , lower antigen production levels fit well to the DC requirements for prolonged antigen presentation to the adaptive immune system ( Figure 8 ) . One major drawback with RepRNA vaccines in general is their high RNase sensitivity . This can be avoided by employing either VRP for delivery or biodegradable nanoparticulate deliv - ery vehicles ( Figure 7 ) [ 9 , 13 , 18 , 20 , 114 , 123 ] . From initial efforts in 2003 , the concept of RepRNA delivery by biodegradable nanoparticles was developed [ 20 ] , showing high poten - tial for delivery to DCs ( Figure 7 ; Figure 8 ) [ 9 , 13 , 18 , 114 , 17 ] . Nonetheless , it is now evident that nanoparticulate technology can lead to compaction of RepRNA ( Figure 7 ) . This was not so apparent with delivery of smaller RNA molecules , such as siRNA and mRNA , only coming to light with the much larger RepRNA molecules . While compaction with the delivery vehicle could interfere with cytosolic translocation , even after the translocation a lack of decompaction would interfere with ribosomal entry and thus translation . Studies turned to the aforemen - tioned importance of protonation within the endocytic vesicle for cytosolic translocation , which could also influence the degree of RNA compaction by the delivery vehicle . Application of cationic components in the delivery vehicles for RepRNA , such as chitosan cores , cationic lipids and cationic polyplexes ( Figure 7 ) , has proven successful for enhancing RepRNA delivery [ 9 , 17 – 19 , 33 , 35 ] . Their cationic nature facilitates interaction with RNA and protection from RNases . In addition , they may favour events leading to cytosolic trans - location from the endocytic vesicles during the initial phases of early endosome - mediated acidification . Application of additional cationic entities , such as lipids or peptides , may further favour cytosolic delivery and decompaction for translation , potentially by reducing the levels Dendritic Cell Endocytosis Essential for Viruses and Vaccines http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 5772 / 67779 117 of compaction obtained by a single cationic entity . Certainly , the presence of cationic lipids in a chitosan - based nanoparticulate delivery vehicle with RepRNA enhanced both the in vitro translation of the delivered RNA , and the induction of humoral and CMI immune defences in vivo ( Figure 7 ; Figure 8 ) [ 18 ] . 10 . Conclusion : dendritic cell endocytosis promoting cross - presentation and RNA translation Dendritic cells , in particular the cDC1 subset , display the capacity for cross - presentation of exogenous antigenic material ( Figure 1 ) . Using SVLPs , DCs primarily endocytose these vaccines via macropinocytosis , but an underlying additional endocytic process is also active [ 14 ] . While a dominant processing towards MHC Class II presentation is evident , cross - presentation pathways also exist , directing the processing towards MHC Class I presenta - tion [ 15 ] . Importantly , these SVLPs do not activate the DC family to promote DC maturation which is essential for efficient induction of adaptive immunity . By modifying the lipopeptide Figure 8 . Overview of the procedures for association of RepRNA vaccines with biodegradable nanoparticulate delivery vehicles , targeting DCs to promote induction of both humoral and cytotoxic immune defences . Biology of Myelomonocytic Cells 118 monomers of the SVLPs to carry TLR2 ligands , certain SVLPs are directed into internal TLR2 - containing sites for induction of cytokines that are important for DC maturation [ 15 ] . The endocytic processes involved in the cytosolic translocation of endocytosed antigen also relate to the delivery of RNA required for translation . RNA vaccines and the genomes of RNA viruses must translocate from the endosomal system or ER ( retrograde transport ) following endocytosis , to facilitate delivery into cytosolic sites of ribosomal translation ( Figure 3 ) . With viruses , this can be promoted by the interaction of viral surface proteins with the endosomal membrane , becoming modified upon acidification by early endosome to create ion channels and / or pores in the membrane for cytosolic transfer of the RNA genomes . RNA vaccines can employ similar strategies , when the RNA is packaged within virus - like particles , which can be seen with self - amplifying replicon RNA vaccine delivery as VRPs . With synthetic RNA vaccines , delivered by synthetic nanoparticulate delivery vehicles rather than VRPs or other virus - like particles ( Figure 7 ) , translocation must occur as the interaction of the RNA with its delivery vehicle becomes weakened to the point of promoting decompaction . There is a criti - cal point of no return , with cytosolic translocation being vital before late endosomal activity dominates . Therefore , the delivery vehicle formulation must facilitate endosomal membrane modification to permit this cytosolic translocation at the appropriate stage of endosomal maturation . An important issue pertinent to nanoparticle delivery is the size of the delivery vehicle being endocytosed . Size and ionic potential of particles interacting with cells , particularly DCs and MΦ , influence both the endocytic route and how the cell handles internalised material [ 43 , 58 ] . The smaller the entity the greater the role played by retrograde transport from endocytic vesicles into the ER [ 58 ] . Macropinocytosis and caveolar endocytic delivery to the ER may occur without interaction with early endosomes , or shortly after acidification begins ( Figure 3 ) . Nonetheless , if the delivery vehicle is designed to promote cytosolic translocation and even decompaction when present in an acidifying environment , then RNA delivery should be directed into macropinosomes and caveolar vesicles interacting with early endosomes . Overall , self - amplifying RepRNA delivery to DCs has high potential for future vaccine development and application , providing controlled and efficacious vaccine delivery , and thus promoting robust immune defence induction ( Figure 8 ) . Of particular importance is the appropriate application of nanoparticulate delivery vehicle formulations to enhance cytosolic translocation of RNA vaccines in DC , while reducing compaction to ensure ribosomal entry for translation of the encoded vaccine antigens and self - amplification of the replicon RNA .
