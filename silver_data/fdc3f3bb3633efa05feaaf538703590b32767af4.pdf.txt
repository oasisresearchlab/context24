Nevertheless , the generation of creative ideas is often hindered by several negative cognitive and social processes [ 18 ] . In recent years , researchers have developed several creativity support tools [ 7 , 14 ] to mitigate such processes and improve the overall fluency and diversity of ideas generated . A typical strategy has been to inspire the ideator with various approaches , ranging from automatic context - aware stimuli [ 1 , 17 ] to real - time creative input from online crowds [ 2 ] . A number of other strategies have also Permission to make digital or hard copies of part or all of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page .

Many of these have leveraged collective intelligence or crowdsourcing [ 21 ] , as open - ended creative problems have been traditionally intractable with automatic methods . However , in recent years the increased scale of large language models has yielded unexpected results opening up a new range of opportunities for AI to be used in creative fields . For example , GPT - 3 [ 4 ] , with its 175 billion parameters , permits in - context learning , in which language models can be adapted to a variety of tasks simply by providing them with proper prompts or natural language descriptions of the tasks . As an example , if we wanted to translate a word from English to French using the capabilities of LLMs , we could provide the following prompt : " English : Hello ; French : " . In response , a large language model would be likely to predict the word " Bonjour " . Similarly , it is possible to use proper prompts to support tasks ranging from sentiment analysis to code creation [ 3 ] . Due to their simplicity of use and their strong generative capa - bilities , LLMs are increasingly used as a support in idea generation tasks , especially those related to creative writing . For example , LLM - based suggestions have been used to help adjust the tone of peer reviews [ 19 ] , create metaphors [ 8 ] , and facilitate collaborative sto - rytelling [ 13 ] . Less explored is , however , the use of AI to generate creative ideas or improve the quality of existing ones in open - ended problems . In this work , we introduce the Idea Machine , a creativity support tool based on LLMs that augments idea generation sessions by expanding , rewriting , combining , and suggesting ideas ( Table 1 ) . As the power of LLMs comes from their emergence paradigm , which makes systems work in ways that haven’t been anticipated when training them , it is important to have a research infrastructure that permits to study the opportunities and challenges that such unexpectedness brings [ 3 ] . The Idea Machine was designed to serve as such an infrastructure . With its design grounded in creativity and Human - Centered AI literature [ 15 ] , the Idea Machine will enable the collection of valuable interaction data in LLM - based augmented ideation , similar to what has been done in other domains [ 11 ] . 2 THE IDEA MACHINE 2 . 1 Design Goals To investigate how large language models can support idea genera - tion , we designed the Idea Machine system . We describe the goals that led to the system’s main features below . 623 C & C ’22 , June 20 – 23 , 2022 , Venice , Italy Giulia Di Fede , Davide Rocchesso , Steven Dow , and Salvatore Andolina Figure 1 : The main user interface ; 1 ) the ideation prompt ; 2 ) the input area ; 3 ) the submitted idea with time indicator ; 4 ) the toggle button for AI inspiration ; 5 ) the toolbar ; 6 ) the drop - down button for ideas filtering . • User control over automation . The Idea Machine is a Human - Centered AI supertool that is meant to amplify human cre - ativity rather than replace it [ 15 ] . As such , a key objective of the system is to enable high levels of automation while giving its users control over the level of intelligent assistance provided by it [ 15 ] . • Automatic generation of inspirations . Exposure to the ideas of others can help people understand the design space better and overcome fixation . To be useful , however , inspirations must come at the right time [ 16 ] and be of high quality [ 9 ] . Furthermore , inspirations may be more effective when users feel they come from a bot instead of a human collaborator [ 10 ] . Therefore , the Idea Machine includes support for the automatic generation of inspirations . To ensure the best results , this kind of support can be requested on - demand [ 16 ] . • Concept combination . A creative idea is often born from the combination of other ideas or concepts [ 20 ] . Although com - plex workflows and expert human guidance are typically required to achieve useful combinations [ 6 ] , recent work [ 5 ] suggests that generative models may be a promising option for providing assistance in concept combination tasks . Sup - porting concept combination is , therefore , a goal of the Idea Machine . • Idea Elaboration . A useful feature of LLMs is their capability to rephrase or expand sentences . As idea elaboration has been historically considered a metric of success in divergent thinking tasks [ 12 ] , we decided to include support for this feature in the Idea Machine . Below we describe how these goals were embodied in the Idea Machine’s user interface . 2 . 2 User interface Figure 1 illustrates the Idea Machine user interface ( UI ) . The top of the UI allows the user to insert an ideation prompt ( Figure 1 - 1 ) . Users can add their ideas to the text area at the bottom ( Figure 1 - 2 ) . Upon submission , the idea will appear with a time indicator in the container ( see Figure 1 - 3 ) . The UI offers a number of features that allow the AI to enhance the current session with creative ideas . When users are stuck and in need of inspiration , they can toggle the Suggestions button in the top bar to activate the idea suggestion function ( Figure 1 - 4 ) . By doing so , the system starts generating ideas using OpenAI’s GPT - 3 language model . Suggestions are based on the prompt and on the ideas added . The other main affordances of the system are intended to augment a particular idea . Access to the tools is provided by a toolbar that appears when hovering over any of the ideas ( Figure 1 - 5 ) . With the " Merge " tool ( Figure 2 - 2 ) , the user can ask GPT - 3 to com - bine the selected idea with one that was earlier generated . When the tool is activated , a pop - up window appears on the right indi - cating the ideas that can be combined with the selection currently being made . When one of such ideas is chosen , the system suggests a third idea that attempts to combine the concepts expressed by the two ideas . The suggestion preview appears at the bottom of the 624 The Idea Machine : LLM - based Expansion , Rewriting , Combination , and Suggestion of Ideas C & C ’22 , June 20 – 23 , 2022 , Venice , Italy popup . If this is accepted , it will replace the original idea . A pencil icon indicates that the idea has been modified . The " Add Keyword " tool ( Figure 2 - 1 ) similarly allows one to combine the idea currently selected with other concepts . By using the model , the system finds new keywords that are related to the current idea but diverge a bit ( see Keyword Discovery in Table 1 ) . The default setting selects one of such keywords and displays a preview of what the idea would look like when combined with that keyword . Users can also explore how the idea could be shaped by combining it with other keywords . When users are satisfied with the result , they can select it to update the active idea . The " History " tool allows users to view the various versions of an idea , which can be reverted to the desired state . The tool " Expand " ( Figure 2 - 4 ) provides an elaborated version of the idea . The tool " Rewrite " ( Figure 2 - 3 ) helps rephrase an idea . Users can also manipulate the list of ideas they have in the container . Selecting the star button will star the idea , and selecting the drop - down button ( Figure 1 - 6 ) will allow them to filter which ideas they would like to see , for example only showing starred ideas . In case the users are not satisfied with an idea , they can hide it . By selecting the " Hidden " filter in the drop - down menu , the user can see all the ideas that have been hidden , and eventually restore them . 3 DEMONSTRATION DESCRIPTION During this demonstration , conference participants will be given a small training on the functionalities of the Idea Machine system . After that , they will be invited to use the system to engage in a creative idea generation task focused on generating solutions to the problem of making AI more sustainable . The process will be supported by the suggestions provided by the Idea Machine system , including fresh ideas generated on the spot or augmentations of specific ideas selected by the participants . For those interested , we will also provide the opportunity to change the idea generation prompt . 4 CONCLUSIONS This demo introduces the Idea Machine to the Creativity and Cog - nition community . The Idea Machine augments idea generation sessions via creative suggestions based on large language models . Suggested ideas could either be fresh ones generated on the spot or augmentations of existing ones with new concepts . The Idea Machine can also help rephrase or elaborate an existing idea . The Idea Machine serves as a research infrastructure for studying op - portunities and challenges associated with the use of LLMs to assist creative tasks 1 .
