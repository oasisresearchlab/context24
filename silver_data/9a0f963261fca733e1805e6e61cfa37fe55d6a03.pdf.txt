A similar approach with macrophages is emerging by blocking the ubiquitously expressed ‘marker of self’ CD47 from binding the inhibitory receptor SIRP a on macrophages . Here , we first summarize available information on the safety and efficacy of CD47 blockade , which raises some safety concerns with the clearance of ‘self’ cells but also suggests some success against hae - matological ( liquid ) and solid cancers . Checkpoint blockade generally benefits from parallel activation of the immune cell , which can occur for macrophages in multiple ways , such as by combination with a second , tumour - opsonizing antibody and perhaps also via rigidity sensing . Cyto - skeletal forces in phagocytosis and inhibitory ‘self’ - signalling are thus reviewed together with macrophage mechanosensing , which extends to reg - ulating levels of SIRP a and the nuclear protein lamin A , which affects phenotype and cell trafficking . Considerations of such physical factors in cancer and the immune system can inform the design of new immunothera - pies and help to refine existing therapies to improve safety and efficacy . This article is part of a discussion meeting issue ‘Forces in cancer : inter - disciplinary approaches in tumour mechanobiology’ . 1 . Introduction Specific molecular interactions between two cells or a cell and extracellular matrix are often viewed as pro - adhesive and ultimately favouring attachment . However , specific interactions can also be inhibitory , as is the case for several tar - gets for cancer therapy in the clinic . Both pro - adhesive and inhibitory interactions can also involve important mechanobiological factors . Immune cells provide particularly illustrative examples as they frequently contact cells that either belong to ‘self’ ( the same organism ) or are ‘foreign’ ( e . g . microbes that breach epithelia ) . Specific molecular interactions at immune cell surfaces lead to recognition of ‘self’ or else result in forceful attack and elimination of ‘foreign’ . An important example with T cells is the protein PD - 1 , which interacts with PD - L1 on multiple ‘self’ cells in parallel with T cell receptor interactions ; if PD - L1 activates the T cell to attack , PD - 1 can effectively passivate it . In cancer , blocking this PD - 1 : PD - L1 checkpoint by systemic injections of antibodies to either of these two proteins leads to T cell elimination of tumours in a minor frac - tion ( approx . 10 – 30 % ) of otherwise untreatable patients , and the patients that respond best are those with the most mutated ( i . e . ‘foreign’ ) tumours [ 1 – 4 ] . In simplest molecular terms , the T cell receptor activates kinases that signal acti - vation while PD - 1 : PD - L1 activates a phosphatase ( e . g . SHP isoform ) that dominates in its inhibition—although there remains much to learn . Mechano - biology is involved at least via the kinases and / or phosphatases that regulate & 2019 The Author ( s ) Published by the Royal Society .

Importantly , this paradigm of activation - dominated - by - inhibition applies not only to other lymphocytes ( e . g . natural killer ( NK ) cells [ 7 ] ) but also to macrophages , which are the focus of this review . 2 . CD47 : SIRP a as a macrophage checkpoint in cancer ‘ Marker of self’ membrane protein CD47 is normally expressed on all cells and binds with weak , sub - micromolar affinity to ‘signal regulatory protein’ SIRP a on macrophages , including precursor monocytes . CD47 : SIRP a binding leads to local accumulation of SIRP a at phagocytic synapses and ultimately to inhibition of engulfment of ‘self’ cells ( figure 1 ) [ 8 , 9 ] . This inhibitory interaction occurs in parallel with various activating interactions , only some of which are well characterized . The clearest example of activation is through immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) antibodies which bind to a target cell and which also engage activating Fc receptors ( FcRs ) on macrophages . Some of the key FcRs signal via kinases in very similar ways to integrins activated by extra - cellular matrix , with a downstream accumulation of focal adhesion proteins such as phospho - paxillin and talin as well as sensitivity to whether the adhesive substrate—i . e . target for phagocytosis—is soft or stiff [ 10 , 11 ] . However , adhesion and phagocytosis of stiff targets more than soft is just one aspect of the mechanosensitivity of macrophages . CD47 : SIRP a blockade strategies have revitalized decades of interest in macrophages as effector cells for cancer therapy . CD47 is expressed on cancer cells [ 12 , 13 ] and was originally described as the OA3 antigen , which is highly upregulated on ovarian cancer cells [ 14 ] ; CD47 should in principle shield cancercellsfromimmunesurveillanceandremovalbyphagocy - tic cells . However , solid tumours possess mechanical properties that can influence cancer phenotypes [ 15 ] and that might also influence immune cells , including macrophages . Studies in mice , for example , suggest high collagen microenvironments ( associated with stiffness ) cause macrophages to upregulate SIRP a expression and also cause macrophages to switch off a pro - phagocytic phenotype [ 16 ] . These factors motivate a renewed focus on the mechanobiology of phagocytic cells which certainly include macrophages but also neutrophils [ 17 ] and dendritic cells [ 18 ] , which both express SIRP a . Patient safety is always a concern in therapy , and the main goal of any Phase 1 clinical trial in the US is to establish a safety window for dosing . Because CD47 is expressed on all cells , anti - CD47 antibodies injected intravenously are readily predicted to bind blood cells . Indeed , the pioneering studies that first described ‘marker of self’ function showed that CD47 - deficient mouse red blood cells ( RBCs ) are engulfed within hours of injection into normal mice by macrophages in the spleen [ 9 ] , with CD47 - deficient platelets exhibiting similar clearance [ 19 ] . CD47 knockout in at least one strain of mouse ( non - obese diabetic , NOD ) leads not only to anae - mia ( RBC loss ) but also to premature death of mice with autoimmunity against RBCs [ 20 ] . None of these mouse studies clearly determined what factors on a CD47 - deficient RBC or platelet activate the engulfment by normal splenic macrophages , but anti - CD47 IgG will engage FcRs and tend to activate phagocytosis . As with integrin - based adhesion , however , a high density of adhesive ligands ( IgG in this case ) favours focal adhesion complex formation and activated adhesion , and CD47 is more of a low - density signalling molecule on RBCs [ 8 ] . Regardless , the various find - ings in mice underscore the importance of safety studies , and the report of autoimmunity also has intriguing implications for the development of anti - cancer immunity . 3 . Clinical blockade of the anti - adhesive CD47 - SIRP a interaction—a current snapshot According to the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) database of clinical trials ( clinicaltrials . gov ) , there are presently 15 ongoing anti - CD47 interventional clinical trials , with all but two in Phase 1 [ 21 – 35 ] . Although tumour cells are unlikely to display sufficiently strong ‘eat me’ factors to activate macro - phages [ 16 ] , and modest upregulation of CD47 on tumours ( e . g . ovarian cancer [ 14 ] ) is unlikely to present sufficient anti - CD47 to activate phagocytosis , clinical trials all must start with injections of just anti - CD47 to test safety without interfer - ence . All current clinical trials targeting CD47 consist of monoclonal antibodies or engineered fusion proteins and are being driven by companies—no doubt because of the costs involved . Designations for these agents are Hu5F9 - G4 ( Forty - Seven Inc . , Menlo Park , CA ) , CC - 90002 ( Celgene Corporation , Summit , NJ ) , TTI - 621 and TTI - 622 ( Trillium Therapeutics Inc . , Mississauga , Ontario , Canada ) , SRF231 ( Surface Oncology , Cambridge , MA ) , ALX148 ( ALX Oncology Inc . , Burlingame , CA ) and IBI188 ( Innovent Biologics , Suzhou , PR China ) . Clini - cal trial details are summarized in table 1 ( complemented by a thorough review of preclinical information in [ 36 ] ) .

B 374 : 2018021 7 3 on these trials remainssparse , but details are emerging in meet - ing abstracts and on company websites . Such information is public but should be treated with caution as it is not clear that companies will publish in peer - reviewed forums , though pub - lications are now beginning to appear . Nonetheless , the information provides some initial insight into the potential safety and efficacy of CD47 blockade therapies in humans . Hu5F9 - G4 is a humanized anti - CD47 monoclonal IgG4 antibody and is the most advanced therapeutic in this class to progress through the clinic [ 37 , 38 ] . The Fc end of an IgG4 engages FcRs only weakly ; one might therefore expect minimal interactions with FcRs on splenic macrophages and perhaps other macrophages . In one of the most advanced trials of Hu5F9 - G4 , the Phase 1b / 2 study for relapsed / refractory non - Hodgkin lymphoma ( r / r NHL ) , patients combined anti - CD47 with rituximab ( anti - CD20 ) to provide an ‘eat me’ signal to acti - vate macrophages ; the reported objective response rate ( ORR ) was 50 % and the complete response rate ( CRR ) was 32 % [ 39 ] . These numbers were revised in late 2018 to 40 % ORR and 33 % CRR in 15 diffuse large B - cell lymphoma patients and 71 % ORR and 43 % CRR in seven follicular lymphoma patients [ 40 ] . The investigators also noted that they were able to limit anaemia bytheadministrationofaprimingdosetoclearolderRBCsprior to maintenance doses , though to what extent is unclear . In Phase 1a of the trial for relapsed / refractory acute myeloid leukaemia ( r / r AML ) , 15 patients tolerated Hu5F9 - G4 well with no maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) reported . However , just two patients exhibited biological activity in response , which the authors defined as ‘significant reduction in marrow cellularity observed similarly in pre - clinical models’ . The majority of the studied patients ( 79 % ) showed grade 3 anaemia prior to dosing in the study and also received transfusions of RBCs [ 41 ] . In prior reported safety results of 13 patients [ 42 ] , the maximum observed hae - moglobin ( Hb ) drop was 5 . 2 g dl 2 1 , representing a loss of about 40 % of RBCs , though the median decrease was 1 . 2 g dl 2 1 . Antibodies are of course bivalent , and some anti - RBC antibodies have long been known to drive cross - linking of RBCs ( haemagglutination ) ; such adhesive clusters of cells can be expected to have impaired circulation , especially through the narrow slits of the spleen—which would tend to favour macrophage interactions and anaemia . Forty - Seven , Inc . has also initiated additional trials against other malignancies to test Hu5F9 - G4 in combination with the che - motherapeutic azacitidine , the anti - epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) monoclonal antibody cetuximab , and the PD - L1 targeting antibody avelumab [ 22 , 25 , 28 ] . Later reports in the first - in - human trial with advanced solid tumours indicated a priming dosing led to 57 and 36 % of patients showing transient anaemia and haemagglutination , respect - ively , mostly grade 2 [ 43 , 44 ] . Whether the loss of RBCs can ever contribute to an autoimmune response to RBCs or other cell types has not been addressed . TTI - 621 is a fully human recombinant SIRP a - Fc fusion protein developed by Trillium Therapeutics , Inc . with preclini - cal evidence for enhanced phagocytosis in AML and B lymphoma xenograft models [ 45 ] . It consists of the N - terminal V - type immunoglobulin - like domain of human SIRP a as a fusion with the Fc portion of human IgG1 . IgG1 is expected to bind FcRs more strongly than IgG4 and may increase both antibody - dependent cell - mediated cytotoxicity and complement - dependent cytotoxicity effects . It is being admi - nistered intravenously for haematologic malignancies and intratumorally for solid tumours and mycosis fungoides [ 46 ] . Early reports in late 2016 showed two patients with dose - limiting toxicities in grade 3 elevated liver enzymes and grade 4 thrombocytopenia ( loss of platelets ) . This result raises questions of the drug safety profile , although later the company stated that this thrombocytopenia was transient and reduced after multiple infusions . The company also reported that 9 out of 10 patients in the intratumorally admi - nistered trial saw a reduction of lesions [ 46 ] , and later , 15 out of 17 r / r mycosis fungoides and Se´zary syndrome patients were described as having measurable improvement in lesion severity [ 47 ] . They have expanded their study to new cohorts receiving TTI - 621 in combination with approaches such as a PD - 1 : PD - L1 inhibitor or radiation therapy . A second candi - date , linked to an IgG4 domain instead of IgG1 , TTI - 622 , was initiated in a Phase 1a / 1b clinical trial in mid - 2018 [ 33 ] . SRF231 is a fully human anti - CD47 antibody being evalu - ated against advanced solid tumours and lymphoma / chronic lymphocytic leukaemia [ 48 ] . CC - 90002 is a humanized anti - CD47 monoclonal antibody of the IgG4 subclass in early clinical development , with preclinical work presented at the 2017 ASCO Annual Meeting [ 49 ] . Both CC - 90002 and SRF231 seem to avoid haemagglutination , but how this is achieved is unclear [ 50 ] . Notably , despite the expansion of anti - CD47 efforts by pharmaceutical companies , Celgene terminated its monotherapy trial of CC - 90002 in October 2018 while continuing to recruit in its combination trial with rituximab [ 34 , 35 ] . This further highlights the importance of combining an activating signal for phagocytosis with blockade of the macrophage checkpoint . ALX148 is a fusion protein with two CD47 binding domains derived from the SIRP a N - terminal D1 domain and an inactive Fc region designed to mitigate haemaggluti - nation and anaemia [ 51 ] . The presence of an inert Fc region also indicates its design as a combination therapeutic with tumour - opsonizing antibodies , unlike agents discussed thus far which can directly engage FcRs on the macrophage surface to mediate effector function [ 52 ] . Reports at the 2018 ASCO Annual Meeting showed data from the first 30 patients enrolled , 25 of whom received only ALX148 , with the remain - ing five patients receiving combination regimens with pembrolizumab ( three patients ) , trastuzumab ( one patient ) or rituximab ( one patient ) . ALX148 was generally tolerated , with four combination patients achieving stable disease statesthough two patients exhibited grade 3 thrombocytopenia [ 53 ] . IBI188 is a fully human anti - CD47 monoclonal IgG4 anti - body and is the most recent drug to move from the preclinical phase to Phase 1 trials , where it is currently being evaluated against advanced malignancies as a monotherapy and in combination with rituximab [ 26 , 27 ] . The trials dosed their first patients in late February 2019 . Blockade of CD47 : SIRP a in patients is thus being pursued by a growing list of companies even though single agent efficacy is not especially compelling . Safety issues that are most easily measured and that are widely reported include significant anaemia , throm - bocytopenia and haemagglutination , which must be balanced in turn with establishing efficacy—most often by combining with an IgG that binds to abundant antigens on a tumour cell and thereby strongly activates adhesion - initiated phago - cytosis . Consequently , the drug space aimed at CD47 : SIRP a has expanded dramatically , with significant investment in new antibodies , small molecules and peptides . r o y a l s o c i e t y pub l i s h i ng . o r g / j o u r n a l / r s t b Ph il .

Targeting the SIRP a side of the CD47 : SIRP a interaction [ 54 , 55 ] rather than CD47 has not yet been attempted in the clinic but could prove analogous to blocking PD - 1 ( on the T cell ) , which shows clinical efficacy , and certainly , preclini - cal anti - SIRP a development efforts are encouraging [ 50 ] . What is appearing clinically is the utility of combination therapies with tumour - specific opsonizing antibodies that seek to strongly shift from anti - phagocytic signals to pro - phagocytic activity . This is especially interesting for patients refractory to tumour - specific monotherapies such as rituxi - mab . The combination approach is now seen in virtually all of the trials discussed above : Hu5F9 - G4 with rituximab , cetuximab and avelumab , CC - 90002 with rituximab , and ALX148 with trastuzumab ( anti - HER2 ) and rituximab , to name a few ( complete list in table 1 ) . It is increasingly clear that elimination of non - ‘self’ requires an ‘eat me’ cue , often by IgG opsonization and subsequent engagement of macro - phage FcRs , in addition to the ‘don’t eat me’ signal of CD47 : SIRP a . In further recognition of the merits of this phenomenon , bispecific antibodies containing CD47 - specific and tumour - specific ( e . g . mesothelin , CD20 or CD33 ) domains are in preclinical development ( reviewed in - depth in [ 56 ] ) , while anti - SIRP a antibodies may also provide opsonization on the tumour cell surface . Effective clearance by innate immune effector cells relies on much more than one or two cell surface interactions . Some immunotherapies have shown unprecedented success in generating durable cures to blood cancers , but have fal - tered in treatment of solid , stiff tumours . Macrophages engulf foreign material in all types of native tissues and thus seem tailor - made to enter and eat solid tumours ; it will therefore be very interesting to see whether the success with anti - CD47 and rituximab against liquid tumours trans - lates to solid tumours . CD47 : SIRP a ’s regulatory role in phagocytosis and physical differences in the tumour microen - vironment between haematological and solid malignancies motivate a deeper understanding of the mechanobiological underpinnings of phagocytosis in healthy and pathological processes . Cells in solid tumours generally adhere strongly to each other and / or to the extracellular matrix—which is not true of liquid tumours and which makes it physically more challenging for a macrophage to completely engulf a cancer cell integrated into a solid tumour . Knowledge of mechanosensing by phagocytes is likely to help maximize the utility of macrophage checkpoint therapies and macro - phage functions more broadly . The following sections describe some of the physical factors to consider in macro - phage biology ( figure 2 a ) and how that information might be used to inform therapeutic design . 5 . Forces in phagocytosis and ‘self’ - signalling Phagocytosis is an ancient process that proceeds by the exten - sive reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and ( often ) via contractions mediated by myosin motors . Myosins bind , cross - link and pull on actin filaments , and myosins are well known to be load - sensitive ( i . e . contractile velocity decays with force ) , which provides a basis for mechanosensitive interactions . As with integrin - mediated adhesion , target par - ticle or cell binding to surface receptors frequently leads to receptor clustering and activates signalling pathways that drive maturation of adhesions via actomyosin activity : for macrophages , this involves the formation of pseudopod pro - trusions around the target , with actin polymerization and branching generating forces of protrusion [ 57 ] . Although the pro - phagocytic signals mediating cancer cell engulfment in the presence of CD47 : SIRP a blocking agents have not been fully elucidated , it is clear that phagocytosis is improved with an opsonizing antibody , suggesting an FcR - mediated mechanism [ 55 , 58 ] . Other pro - phagocytic signals may also be involved , depending on the target . Phagocytosis of hae - matopoietic cancer cells by macrophages is reported to depend on Mac - 1 ( complement receptor - 3 , CR3 or a M b 2 integrin ) , which binds to an unknown receptor on its target , along with a homotypic SLAMF7 interaction and signalling through ITAM - containing co - receptors [ 59 ] . Calreticulin is also proposed to be a pro - phagocytic signal recognized by scavenger receptor LRP - 1 on macrophages [ 60 ] . These pro - phagocytic cues are an emerging theme in CD47 : SIRP a blockade trials and may be especially critical for the success of these agents in shrinking solid tumours . Several myosin motor proteins localize at phagocytic synapses ( figure 2 b ) [ 61 – 64 ] . The role of myosin in FcR - and complement receptor - mediated phagocytosis has been investi - gated by pharmacological inhibitors as well as overexpression and knockdown of non - muscle myosin IIa ( NMIIA ) . Target engulfment is deficient in mouse bone marrow - derived macrophages and macrophage cell lines treated with inhibi - tors of myosin light chain kinase ( i . e . ML7 ) or myosin ( i . e . 2 , 3 - butanedione monoxime and blebbistatin ) [ 8 , 62 , 65 , 66 ] . Similarly , the human monocytic cell line THP - 1 internalizes ‘non - self’ sheep RBCs less efficiently when transfected with small interfering ( siRNA ) against NMIIA and more efficiently when NMIIA is overexpressed [ 8 ] . Scanning electron microscopy revealed that ML7 - treated cells still form phagocy - tic cups bound to IgG - opsonized sheep RBCs , but the membrane protrusions are not as closely associated with the target as in the untreated control [ 67 ] . Thus , it appears that actin assembly and membrane protrusion occur indepen - dently of myosin IIA in FcR - mediated phagocytosis , but mature or stable adhesions might require contractility through NMIIA . By contrast , in complement receptor - mediated phago - cytosis , NMIIA is implicated even earlier in the process and mediates actin organization with a requirement for Rho - ROCK signalling [ 65 ] . Other myosins , including class I myosins and myosin X , have been observed to participate in various stages of phagocytosis and have potential roles in phagosome formation and closure [ 62 – 64 ] . Cell spreading on matrix - coated substrates uses many of the same cellular components as phagocytosis , and cells typi - cally exhibit greater spreading on stiff substrates than on soft ones . Similarly , the efficiency of phagocytosis is determined in part by the stiffness of the target , with softer targets regarded as more difficult to phagocytose than stiff targets , a factor to consider in cancer cell engulfment . This has been demonstrated with engineered hydrogel microbeads [ 10 , 68 ] and chemically stiffened RBCs [ 11 ] . In the light of this effect , control of particle stiffness has risen as a strategy to increase the circulation time of drug - loaded nanocarriers through delaying phagocytic clearance by splenic and liver macrophages [ 68 , 69 ] .

B 374 : 2018021 7 5 accomplished by decorating particles or viruses with recombinant CD47 or small ‘self’ - peptide mimetics [ 70 , 71 ] . When CD47 on a target cell ( or engineered particle or virus ) engages SIRP a on macrophages , the cytoplasmic immunoreceptor tyrosine inhibitory motif ( ITIM ) of SIRP a is phosphorylated and recruits the phosphatase SHP - 1 ( figure 2 b ) [ 72 ] . NMIIA is a direct target of SHP - 1 , which inhi - bits NMIIA accumulation at the phagocytic synapse and prevents the macrophage from efficiently engulfing the target [ 8 ] . For very stiff opsonized targets , however , such as dialdehyde - cross - linked RBCs , NMIIA becomes hyperacti - vated at the phagocytic synapse in macrophages and inhibitory signalling is unable to prevent target engulfment [ 11 ] . This could have implications for the phagocytosis of cancer cells and for cancer treatment . Cancer cells can be softer than normal cells [ 73 ] , which together with increased expression of CD47 [ 12 , 13 ] could allow transformed cells to evade phagocytosis . Alternatively , stiffening of cancer cells following chemotherapy could make pre - treated tumours more susceptible to phagocytosis and macrophage check - point therapies [ 74 ] . Future progress on this subject could identify biophysical signatures of cancer cells that relate to response to anti - CD47 therapy for predictive or prognostic purposes . The interaction of CD47 and SIRP a on juxtaposed membranes is also governed by physical forces , including CD47 engages SIRP a : – deactivation of myosin IIa – inhibition of phagocytosis SIRP a : CD47 anti - CD47 Ab myosin IIa actin Fc receptor and opsonizing Ab Solid tumour mechanics : – cell – ECM adhesion – cell – cell adhesion – target stiffness Polarization anti - inflammatory pro - inflammatory CD206 MHCII IL - 4 , IL - 10 , etc .

Summary of macrophage mechanobiology and forces in phagocytosis . ( a ) Many factors play roles in macrophage interactions and the immune cells’ ability to clear ‘foreign’ matter . In solid tumours , macrophages must contend with cell – matrix and cell – cell adhesions that can influence their ability to engage and eat cancer cells . Macrophages sense matrix properties through podosome adhesions and exhibit lamin A levels that scale with matrix stiffness . Such matrix to nucleus mechanosensing might influence macrophage polarization characterized by different cytokine secretions and surface marker expression . ( b ) Engagement of CD47 by SIRP a recruits the phosphatase SHP - 1 to the phagocytic synapse in the macrophage where it inhibits myosin IIa assembly ( top ) . In blockade therapy , activating signals from the clustering of Fc receptors drive cytoskeletal reorganization and myosin IIa assembly which promote phagocytosis .

B 374 : 2018021 7 6 fluctuations of the flexible plasma membrane . In cell - derived giant vesicles displaying human CD47 , vesicle spreading and CD47 accumulation was observed on SIRP a - coated coverslips [ 75 ] . The apparent binding affinity increased with the concen - tration of CD47 : SIRP a complexes , indicating a cooperative interaction that arises from a decrease in out - of - plane mem - brane fluctuations . As a result , even low expression levels of CD47 or SIRP a alleles with low binding affinity may be able to achieve sufficient levels of ‘self’ - signalling to limit pha - gocytosis . Decreasing the pH to mimic acidosis that is frequently observed in tumours rigidifies the vesicle mem - brane and decreases cooperativity . It is speculated that such a loss of cooperativity could permit macrophages to phagocy - tose cells expressing low levels of CD47 , and in doing so select for cancer cells expressing high levels of CD47 [ 75 ] . 6 . Macrophage mechanosensing from matrix to nucleus and SIRP a In cancer clearance , monocytes and macrophages face a number of challenges presented by the tumour microenviron - ment ; they must be able to extravasate through small or large pores , differentiate to a phagocytic phenotype , resist repro - gramming to an anti - phagocytic state , and ultimately , eat their targets . This process requires the ability to probe and respond to the mechanical forces surrounding the cells . Macrophages lack focal adhesions and stress fibres but form podosome adhesions with the extracellular matrix that are capable of sensing the environment [ 76 ] . These structures contain a protruding branched actin core and peripheral acto - myosin cables attached to integrins through adapter proteins , and multiple podosomes can be connected into higher - order structures . Force generation in podosomes involves actin polymerization in the core and myosin contractility , which allows cells to probe substrate stiffness [ 76 ] . Human mono - cyte - derived macrophages form more podosomes on stiff substrates than on soft substrates , and phosphorylation of myosin light chain and force generation are also correlated with substrate stiffness [ 77 , 78 ] . How the mechanical stimuli sensed at podosomes are transduced to alter gene expression remains unclear but is likely to be critical in understanding macrophage behaviour and how the tumour microenviron - ment can directly or indirectly affect the cells’ ability to clear ‘foreign’ targets . Mechanosensing macrophages exhibit differential spread - ing , migration and polarization , depending on the physical properties of the matrix . Alveolar macrophages from rats are rounded when cultured on soft epithelial monolayers but flatten and spread on polyacrylamide gels of intermediate compliance and stiff glass substrates [ 79 ] . Similarly , human monocyte - derived macrophages are more spread on stiff polyacrylamide gels coated with fibronectin than on soft ones [ 80 ] . A biphasic relationship between cell area and substrate stiffness has also been reported for human macro - phages , with a maximal area reached at an intermediate stiffness [ 81 ] . Both studies observed stiffness effects on macrophage migration in two dimensions . In three dimensions , human monocyte - derived macrophages exhibit different migration modes , depending on the structure of the matrix , but seem to be less sensitive to matrix stiffness than to matrix organization [ 82 ] . In Matrigel or a dense col - lagen gel , macrophages underwent mesenchymal migration that was slow and dependent on protease activity . In a fibril - lar collagen matrix , macrophages underwent amoeboid migration , which was faster and protease - independent . Podo - some - like protrusions with collagen - degrading activity were observed during mesenchymal migration through collagen gel but not during amoeboid migration through fibrillar collagen . Macrophages exhibit considerable plasticity with respect to their polarization or activation states [ 83 ] . Very broadly , macrophages can be polarized to a classical , inflammatory state or to alternatively activated states with anti - inflamma - tory or wound healing properties . Biophysical cues , including matrix stiffness , topography and external forces , can potentially influence macrophage polarization ( reviewed in [ 84 , 85 ] ) , although further research into their effects is still needed . In particular , investigations of the effects of matrix stiffness on macrophage polarization have reached very different conclusions as to whether stiffness promotes an inflammatory or alternatively an activated phenotype [ 86 – 91 ] . This may be due in part to different sources of macrophages ( primary cells versus cell lines ) , to different substrates ( syn - thetic polymer scaffolds , collagen gels , etc . ) and adhesive ligands ( fibronectin , collagen ) , and to simultaneous acti - vation with different cytokines ( e . g . IFN g , IL - 4 / IL - 13 ) or inflammatory signals ( e . g . LPS ) . Alternatively , differences could be due to the inadequacy of current classification methods to describe the full range of macrophage polariz - ation or to the relatively weak effect of substrate stiffness on this phenotype . Given the altered matrix and different physical cues potentially present in solid tumours , the effi - cacy of macrophage checkpoint blockade may be strongly influenced by the macrophages’ ability to sense and respond to this matrix while maintaining a pro - phagocytic phenotype . Several studies have noted a relationship between macrophage shape and polarization [ 92 , 93 ] . Polarization of macrophages toward an inflammatory phenotype with lipo - polysaccharide ( LPS ) and interferon - g ( IFN g ) produces round cells while alternative activation with interleukin - 4 and interleukin - 13 produces elongated cells [ 92 ] . The converse also appears to be true . When mouse bone marrow - derived macrophages are cultured on micropatterned lines of fibronec - tin , they become elongated and upregulate expression of anti - inflammatory markers Arg - 1 ( arginase - 1 ) and CD206 while downregulating inflammatory markers iNOS ( inducible nitric oxide synthase ) and IFN g [ 92 ] . Pharmacological inhibition of the actin cytoskeleton with cytochalasin D or cel - lular contractility with blebbistatin , ML - 9 or Y27632 attenuates this polarization . Perhaps consistent with the effects of shape on macrophage polarization , the moderate cyclic strain of macrophages on polymeric scaffolds [ 94 ] and interstitial flow shear forces [ 95 ] seem to promote alternative activation . With some exceptions , tissue - resident macrophages orig - inate from yolk sac - or fetal liver - derived haematopoietic cells during embryonic development [ 96 ] . In response to injury or inflammation , monocytes can also be recruited to tissues from circulation and differentiated into macrophages . Transcriptomic and epigenetic analyses have revealed that macrophage phenotype is tailored by the local microenviron - ment [ 97 , 98 ] . Whether biophysical cues including matrix stiffnesscontributetotissue - specificphenotypesinmacrophages remains unclear but plausible . Macrophages reside in tissues that span a wide range of stiffnesses . For example , microglia are the resident macro - phages in brain tissue , which is very soft with an elastic r o y a l s o c i e t y pub l i s h i ng . o r g / j o u r n a l / r s t b Ph il . T r a n s . R . S o c . B 374 : 2018021 7 7 modulus of approximately 0 . 3 kPa . Osteoclasts are the resi - dent macrophages on bone tissue , which is much stiffer with an elastic modulus of greater than 30 kPa ( non - calcified , and far higher for calcified ) . Using mass spectrometry - based proteomics , it was demonstrated that the nuclear intermediate filament protein lamin A , but not lamin B , is mechanosensi - tive [ 99 ] . Specifically , lamin A protein levels measured in mouse tissue lysates exhibit a power - law scaling with tissue elasticity E while lamin B levels remain nearly constant . In a meta - analysis of transcriptomic data from different mouse tissue - resident macrophages , the ratio of lamin A to lamin B mRNA ( LMNA : LMNB ) also exhibited power - law scaling with E [ 100 ] . Consistent with this finding , immunofluores - cence staining of lamin A was greater in phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) - differentiated THP - 1 cells when cultured on stiff polyacrylamide gels than when cultured on soft gels [ 16 ] . The increased stiffness of collagenous tumours relative to normal tissue has implications for lamin A expression in tumour - associated macrophages ( TAMs ) and for macro - phage - adoptive transfer therapies . For example , the LMNA : LMNB transcript ratio in macrophages isolated from subcu - taneous A549 lung cancer xenografts conformed to the power - law scaling relationship with the measured tumour stiffness [ 16 ] . This suggests that TAMs are mechanosensitive and that increased stiffness in tumours could in principle con - tribute to the reprogramming of monocytes recruited from circulation or tissue - resident macrophages to TAMs . In the macrophage checkpoint context , high - collagen microenviron - ments in vivo ( associated with stiffness ) and stiff gels in vitro cause macrophages to upregulate SIRP a expression and also cause macrophages to switch off a pro - phagocytic phenotype [ 16 ] . For therapy , this likely means that more blockade anti - body will be required and perhaps more opsonizing antibody to activate a macrophage . 7 . Macrophage infiltration and differentiation Within dense , fibrotic tissues , including collagenous tumours , extracellular matrix fibres create constrictions that are generic barriers to three - dimensional migration . As the largest orga - nelle in the cell , the nucleus limits migration through narrow constrictions and must be deformed to pass through pores smaller than the nuclear diameter . Thus , by controlling the deformability and mechanical integrity of the nucleus , lamin expression and scaling with tissue elasticity have impli - cations for tumour infiltration and macrophage migration as well as egress from marrow . Lamin levels in haematopoietic cells are indeed relevant to migration through small pores such as those encountered while trafficking from the bone marrow into circulation or from circulation into tissue [ 99 , 101 ] . Three - dimensional migration through Transwell filters with 3 – 8 m m diameter pores has served as an in vitro model of constricted migration [ 102 , 103 ] . High levels of lamin A protect the nucleus but can also limit migration [ 102 ] . Nuclear rupture and cell death have been observed in human monocyte - derived dendritic cells migrating through 2 m m constrictions in microfluidic channels [ 104 ] . Whether nuclear rupture occurs frequently during macrophage migration in vivo is unknown , but the leakage of DNA into the cytoplasm or formation of micronuclei could have signifi - cant inflammatory effects by activating the cGAS / STING pathway of interferon activation [ 104 , 105 ] . Infiltration is thus physically modulated but has implications for cell fate and inflammation—which are likely to impact the success of checkpoint blockade . Lamin A has also been described as a differentiation marker in the monocyte lineage . Early studies showed lamin A and the alternative splicing product lamin C are undetectable in rat bone marrow - derived precursor cells but increase significantly following in vitro differentiation to monocytes and macrophages [ 106 ] . A similar increase was observed during the in vitro differentiation of human periph - eral blood monocytes to macrophages . Differentiation of the HL - 60 cell line to monocyte - and macrophage - like cells by PMA increases levels of both lamin A and B [ 107 ] . Lamin A and B expression and the A : B ratio vary greatly during hae - matopoietic maturation in vivo as measured by mass spectrometry - calibrated , intracellular flow cytometry of freshly isolated human marrow and blood cells [ 108 ] . While the total lamin levels decrease slightly or remain approxi - mately constant between human marrow progenitor cells ( CD34 þ CD38 þ , CD34 þ CD38 2 ) and peripheral blood or marrow monocytes and granulocytes , the lamin A : B ratio increases due to downregulation of lamin B and upregulation of lamin A . Flow cytometry measurements also revealed that the total amount of lamin A and B is lower in haematopoietic cells that traffic into circulation ( e . g . lymphocytes and periph - eral blood granulocytes and monocytes ) than cells residing primarily in the bone marrow compartment ( e . g . CD34 þ pro - genitor cells , erythroblasts , megakaryocyte lineages and mesenchymal stem cells ) . Like cancer cells , the constricted migration of haematopoietic cells through Transwell pores approximating marrow sinusoidal capillaries is strongly influenced by lamins [ 108 ] . Through such processes and others , lamin A levels can also change during macrophage activation in vivo . Mouse peritoneal macrophages collected 5 days after stimulation with thioglycollate stain strongly for lamin A / C whereas unstimulated macrophages do not [ 106 ] . Together , these results indicate that the nuclear lamins , which are key components of the matrix to nuclear mechanosensing pathway , exhibit different expression during lineage maturation and across different tissues . It will be important to determine whether such changes are accompanied by changes in levels of SIRP a . 8 . Conclusion The CD47 : SIRP a axis is an intriguing , rapidly emerging therapeutic target involving innate immune macrophages . It is likely dependent not only on strongly opsonizing anti - bodies ( such as rituximab ) but also on other processes and factors , including mechanical ones . Safety issues include clearance of RBCs and platelets , and these mechanically related processes and factors could play a role . Phagocytic effector cells are well known to be sensitive to their microen - vironment , which motivates the careful study of the physical forces involved in phagocytosis and the broader mechano - biology of macrophages , including precursor monocytes . Matrix mechanics in solid tumours affect cancer cells and likely immune cells as well , and physical forces also govern the level of SIRP a as well as the engagement of CD47 : SIRP a , which inhibits phagocytosis .
