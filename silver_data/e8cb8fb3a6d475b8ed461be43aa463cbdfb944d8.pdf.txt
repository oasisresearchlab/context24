Whether sleep also benefits implicit intuitive decisions about underlying patterns is unclear . We examined sleep ’ s role in explicit and intuitive semantic coherence judgments . Participants encoded sets of three words and after a sleep or wake period were required to judge the potential convergence of these words on a common fourth associate . Compared with wakefulness , sleep increased the number of explicitly named common associates and decreased the number of intuitive judgments . This suggests that sleep enhances the extraction of explicit knowledge at the expense of the ability to make intuitive decisions about semantic coherence . [ Supplemental material is available for this article . ] In everyday life we sometimes make decisions based on a “ gut feeling ” without knowing the exact reasons for why we decided in this way . Intuitive processing has been conceptualized as the preliminary detectionofmeaningin theenvironmentbyrecogniz - ing “ some pattern , structure , or organization [ that ] exists prior to its detection ” ( Bowers et al . 1997 ) . Intuitive processes are assumed to draw on tacit knowledge stored in semantic memory networks . This tacit knowledge may be momentarily inaccessible to con - scious awareness , but can be activated by environmental cues ( Yaniv and Meyer 1987 ; Bowers et al . 1990 ) . In a classical task measuring intuition , participants are asked to make semantic coherence judgments on three presented words , like SALT DEEP FOAM ( e . g . , Bolte and Goschke 2005 ; Topolinski and Strack 2009 ) . Semantic coherence is de ﬁ ned by the existence of a fourth word that the word triad ’ s constituents ( remotely ) haveincommon , thecommonassociate ( OCEANinthisexample ) . Studies have shown that participants perform above chance level in correctly judging coherent triads as coherent even if they are not able to name the common associate . This process of generating thefeelingofsemanticassociativityhasbeenconceptualizedintheframeworkofautomaticspreadofactivation . According tothis , the encounter of the triad automatically triggersthe activation of relat - ed concepts stored in semantic memory resulting in a coherence impression . This ﬁ rst implicit coherence impression can become consciously accessible if enough activation has accumulated to cross a threshold of awareness resulting in the ability to explicitly name the common associate ( Bowers et al . 1990 ) . Even though in - tuitive decision making has been behaviorally described in several studies ( e . g . , Bolte and Goschke 2005 ; Topolinski and Strack 2009 ) , the physiological mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are largely unknown ( Volz and Zander 2014 ) . Sleep is well - known to facilitate the consolidation of newly encoded material by strengthening and integrating new memory representations into the long - term store ( e . g . , Diekelmann and Born 2010 ; Stickgold and Walker 2013 ) . For example , sleep facili - tates the generalization and abstraction of schema - like informa - tion from single encoded elements ( Lewis and Durrant 2011 ) . Sleep also supportsthe conversionof implicitly learned regularities into explicit knowledge about those regularities , allowing for “ in - sight ” into underlying patterns ( Fischer et al . 2006 ; Yordanova et al . 2008 ; Drosopoulos et al . 2011 ; Verleger et al . 2013 ) . Along these lines , Monaghan et al . ( 2015 ) observed that sleep improves analog - ical transfer in problem solvingbyabstractingand structurallygen - eralizing rules and / or task solutions across different problems . Such processes are assumed to rely on the covert reactivation ( “ re - play ” ) of learning - related neuronal activity during sleep ( Cousins et al . 2014 ; Diekelmann et al . 2016 ) . Sleep also enhances associative memory processes ( Stickgold et al . , 1999 ) . Two recent sleep studies applied the remote associate task ( RAT ) , in which participants are asked to ﬁ nd a semantic con - cept that forms a link between three presented words ( for instance HEART SIXTEEN COOKIE , solution : SWEET ) . The RAT is similar to the semantic coherence task described above but tests for explicit solutions only , while not assessing intuitive responses . Cai et al . ( 2009 ) found that sleep facilitatesthe ability to explicitly name sol - ution words in the RAT , yetonly when solutionwords were primed before sleep . Sio et al . ( 2013 ) , using similar RAT stimuli , showed that sleep can increase the generation of explicit solutions even without priming , but this effect was restricted to dif ﬁ cult RAT items . Althoughthese studiesprovide a ﬁ rst hintthatundercertain conditions sleep increases the generation of explicit RAT solutions , the effect of sleep on intuitive judgments remains unknown . Here , we asked whether sleep affects intuitive and explicit semantic coherence judgments . We hypothesized that sleep in - creases the number of explicit responses as well as the number of intuitive judgments . This was based on the automatic spread of ac - tivation account : We assumed that concepts , comprising core and remote associations , with a relatively strong activation before sleep would be boosted during sleep to cross the threshold of awareness , resulting in more explicit solutions . Concurrently , weakly activat - ed concepts should be boosted during sleep as well , such that after Corresponding author : thea . zander @ unibas . ch # 2017 Zander et al .

Altogether 31 healthy , German native - speaking , right - handed students participated in the experiment . They were ran - domly allocated to one of two groups , a sleep group ( n = 15 , 8 fe - male ) and a wake group ( n = 16 , 10 female ) . One sleep participant was excluded because he reported regular sleep disturbances . Mean age did not differ between groups ( sleep group : 24 . 07 ± 3 . 32 ( SD ) ; wake group : 24 . 13 ± 4 . 12 ; t = − 0 . 043 , df = 29 , p = 0 . 97 ) . Females did not use any hormonal contraceptives and the experi - ments were scheduled in the mid - luteal phase of their menstrual cycle , in orderto control forpreviouslyreported effectsof menstru - al cycle phase and hormonal contraceptives on sleep - dependent memory consolidation ( Genzel et al . 2012 , 2014 ) . Further exclu - sion criteria were : medication , nightshifts for at least 8 wks before the experiment , sleep disturbances or irregular sleep – wake cycle , neurological or sleep - related diseases , being involved in the prepa - ration of an imminent exam , and caffeine / alcohol intake on the experimental day . Participants were instructed not to take naps during the experimental day . All participants gave written in - formed consent and the study was approved by the local ethics committee of the Medical Faculty of the University of Tübingen . The experiment consisted of two sessions , initial encoding in the ﬁ rstsessionandtestingin thesecondsession . Duringthereten - tion interval between encoding and testing , participants either slept 8 h during the night ( sleep group ) or stayed awake during the day ( wake group ) ( Fig . 1A ) . Participants in the sleep group came to the laboratory in the evening ( ∼ 22 : 00 ) and were prepared for polysomnographic recordings . To control for general alertness , they performed a vigilance task assessing reaction times and error rates ( Roach et al . 2006 ) and rated their subjective sleepiness on the Stanford Sleepiness Scale ( Hoddes et al . 1973 ) . Subsequently , encoding of the word triads took place , and thereafter participants were allowed to sleep for 8 h in the laboratory , with polysomno - graphic data continuously being recorded . Standard polysomnog - raphy included electroencephalography ( EEG , at positions C3 and C4 ) , electrooculography ( EOG ) , and electromyography ( EMG ) . Sleep stages were determined of ﬂ ine according to the standard cri - teria by Rechtschaffen and Kales ( 1968 ) . Participants showed nor - mal sleep patterns with a total sleep time of 443 . 67 ± 9 . 34 min ( see Supplemental Table S1 for detailed sleep data ) . During testing in the morning ( ∼ 07 : 30 ) , participants performed the semantic coher - ence judgment task ﬁ rst and were then tested on their explicit memory for the encoded word triads in a cued recall and a recogni - tion task . Participants then performed the vigilance task and rated their subjective sleepiness again ( see Supplemental Table S2 for all control data ; none of the control data revealed any differences be - tween groups ) . The wake group started encoding in the morning ( ∼ 09 : 00 ) , following the same procedure as the sleep group . After the encoding session , participants left the laboratory and went about their daily activities . Testing took place in the early evening ( ∼ 17 : 30 ) , again following the same procedure as the sleep group . For the semantic coherence judgment task , participants shal - lowly encoded 200 word triads ( 100 coherent , 100 incoherent ; Fig . 1B ) . Encoding was embedded in a vowel counting task . The three words of each triad were presented for either 2 sec ( short encoding ) or 4 sec ( long encoding ) and subjects were instructed to count the numberofvowelsinthethreewordsandgivetheirresponsewithin 3 sec . At testing after the sleep / wake interval , half of the previously encoded word triads ( 50 coherent and 50 incoherent ) were ran - domly presented for 4 sec and subjects had to indicate whether the triad was semantically coherent or incoherent . Irrespective of their response , participants were asked to type in a common asso - ciate right after their coherence judgment . Common associates were counted as correct if the exact word or a plausible synonym was produced . For explicit coherence judgments , the percentage of correctly produced common associates wascalculated , irrespective of priorcoher - ence judgments . To assess intuitive co - herence judgments , we computed the intuition index de ﬁ ned as the difference between hits ( coherent triads correctly classi ﬁ ed as coherent , but without a cor - rect common associate ) and false alarms ( incoherent triads falsely classi ﬁ ed as co - herent ) ( cf . Bolte et al . 2003 ) . Intuitive co - herence judgments were only computed for triads for which participants did not come up with a correct common associ - ate , therefore explicit coherence judg - ments and the intuition index consist of different trial types ( note that both mea - sures were not correlated with each other , in the overall sample , r = − 0 . 13 , p = 0 . 49 , as well as in the sleep group , r = 0 . 06 , p = 0 . 84 , and in the wake group , r = 0 . 25 , p = 0 . 36 , separately ) . The overall response pattern of the coherence judgments is illustrated in Table 1 . Analysis of explicit coherence judgments showedthat sleep participants produced signi ﬁ cantly more common associates than wake participants ( sleep : 50 . 74 ± 3 . 97 % , wake : 40 . 53 ± 2 . 38 % ; main effect “ sleep / wake ” : F ( 1 , 28 ) = 5 . 15 , p = 0 . 031 ) , suggesting that the likelihood of becoming aware of explicit solutions was higher after sleep than wakefulness ( Fig . 2A ) . This sleep – wake difference was Figure 1 . Schematic overview of the experimental procedure and the tasks . ( A ) The sleep group encoded the word triads in the evening and was tested in the next morning after 8 h of sleep . For the wake group , encoding and testing took place in the morning and evening , respectively . ( B ) For the semantic coherence judgment task , shallow encoding of 200 word triads ( 100 coherent , 100 inco - herent ) was embedded in a vowel counting task . Word triads were presented for either 2 sec ( short en - coding ) or 4 sec ( long encoding ) and participants were asked to type in the overall number of vowels for each triad . At testing , half of the encoded triads ( 50 coherent and 50 incoherent ) were presented again in a coherence judgment task and participants had to indicate whether the triad was semantically coher - ent or incoherent . They were instructed that coherent triads have a fourth word in common that char - acterizes the semantic link between its constituents , that is , a common associate . There were three response options : ( inc ) the triad is incoherent , ( cnoCA ) the triad is coherent , but a common associate cannot be retrieved immediately , ( cCA ) the triad is coherent and a common associate can be retrieved immediately . Irrespective of their response , participants were asked to type in a common associate right after their coherence judgment . ( C ) After the semantic coherence judgment , participants ’ explicit memory for the encoded word triads was tested . In a cued recall test , the other half of the previously encoded word triads ( 50 coherent and 50 incoherent ) was tested . The ﬁ rst word of each triad was pre - sented and participants were asked to type in the second , third , or both corresponding words . The sub - sequent recognition test consisted of all of the 200 encoded word triads intermixed with 200 new word triads , for which participants had to indicate whether each triad was old ( i . e . , presented before ) or new .

However , triads that had been encoded for 2 sec before the sleep / wake interval had a generally higher likelihood of being explicitly solved than triads that had been encoded for 4 sec ( short : 65 . 96 ± 3 . 16 % , long : 24 . 64 ± 2 . 43 % ; main effect “ short / long ” : F ( 1 , 28 ) = 189 . 28 , p < 0 . 001 ) . In contrast to explicit judgments , sleep participants showed signi ﬁ cantly fewer intuitive judgments than wake participants ( sleep : 8 . 77 ± 2 . 41 % , wake : 21 . 16 ± 2 . 16 % ; main effect “ sleep / wake ” : F ( 1 , 28 ) = 14 . 71 , p < 0 . 001 ) , suggesting that sleep compared with wakefulness distinctly reduced the ability to make intuitive decisions ( Fig . 2B ) . Importantly , both intuition indices , forthesleepandwakegroups , weresignif - icantly higher than chance level ( chance level = 0 ; sleep : t ( 13 ) = 3 . 63 , p < 0 . 005 ; wake : t ( 15 ) = 9 . 78 , p < 0 . 001 ) . Since the in - tuition index is calculated as the differ - ence between hits and false alarms , we analyzed these measures separately to ex - amine whether the lower intuition index inthesleepgroupresultedfromlowerhits or from higher false alarms . Sleep partici - pants showed signi ﬁ cantly fewer hits compared with wake participants ( 29 . 41 ± 5 . 41 % versus 51 . 77 ± 5 . 16 % ; t ( 28 ) = − 2 . 89 , p = 0 . 006 ) , whereas false alarms did not differ signi ﬁ cantly ( 20 . 64 ± 4 . 61 % versus 30 . 60 ± 4 . 51 % ; t ( 28 ) = − 1 . 53 , p = 0 . 14 ) . Like for explicit respons - es , the difference between sleep and wakefulnessintheintuitionindexwasin - dependent of the encoding duration ( in - teraction effect “ sleep / wake ” × “ short / long ” : F ( 1 , 28 ) = 0 . 41 , p = 0 . 52 ) , but a signif - icantly higher intuition index was ob - served for triads that were encoded for 2 sec than for triads that were encoded for 4 sec before the sleep or wake interval ( short : 34 . 12 ± 4 . 64 % , long : 6 . 25 ± 2 . 58 % ; main ef - fect “ short / long ” : F ( 1 , 28 ) = 27 . 89 , p < 0 . 001 ) . To test for explicit memory of the encoded word triads , a cued recall test and a recognition test were performed after the semantic coherence task ( Fig . 1C ) . For cued recall , the ﬁ rst word of half of the encoded word triads ( 50 coherent and 50 incoherent ) was present - ed and subjects were asked to name the second and / or third word ofthe triad . Overallcuedrecall performancewasvery lowandthere was no difference between the sleep and wake groups ( number of recalled words , sleep : 1 . 90 ± 0 . 42 , wake : 2 . 10 ± 0 . 48 ; all p > 0 . 17 ) .

In the recognition test , all encoded word triads ( 100 coherent and 100 incoherent ) were presented againtogetherwithnewtriadsand subjects were asked to indicate for each triad whether it was old ( i . e . , encoded before ) or new .

Across both encoding periods ( short / long ) and both groups ( sleep / wake ) , participants recognized coherent triads ( sleep : 47 . 06 ± 4 . 19 % , wake : 53 . 63 ± 2 . 20 % ) better than incoherent triads ( sleep : 43 . 33 ± 4 . 69 % , wake : 49 . 84 ± 3 . 53 % ) , main effect type of triad : F ( 1 , 28 ) = 7 . 28 , p = 0 . 012 . These ﬁ ndingsshowthat , contrarytoour hypothesis , sleepaf - fected explicit and intuitive coherence judgments differently . When compared with the wakefulness retention interval , sleep resulted in a higher number of explicitly named common as - sociates . However , sleep did not bene ﬁ t but even diminished the ability to make intuitive judgments about semantic coherence . Interestingly , independent of the effect of sleep , both explicit and intuitive judgments were higher if the word triads had been encoded for 2 sec when compared with 4 sec . Our data are consistent with previous research , showing that sleep selectively bene ﬁ ts memory representations that are in any way relevant or important to the individual : Sleep preferentially consolidates associative memories expected to be relevant for a re - trieval test after sleep ( Wilhelm et al . 2011 ) . Similarly , sleep favors the consolidation of procedural memories for which participants anticipated to be rewarded at testing after sleep ( Fischer and Born 2009 ) . Memories that are emotionally salient are likewise preferen - tially enhanced during sleep , at the expense of neutral informa - tion , a phenomenon known as “ emotional trade - off ” ( Payne et al . 2008 ; Payne and Kensinger 2010 ) . Based on this evidence , we speculate that in our study sleep - dependent processing favored associations that appeared to be more relevant or important and suppressed irrelevant associations , with relevance possibly being signaled by the relative strength of the encoded associations . It has been suggested that sleep particularly favors associations with a medium encoding strength ( Stickgold 2009 ; Wilhelm et al . 2012 ) , while associations that are too weak or too strong do not bene ﬁ t from sleep ( Drosopoulos et al . 2007 ; Tucker and Fishbein 2008 ) . Considering that in the present study , word triads were encoded shallowly and incidentally , the overall encoding strengthwaspresumablymoderate , suchthatrelativelystrongeras - sociations fell within the medium strength range , while relatively weaker associations may have been too weak to bene ﬁ t from sleep . Accordingly , sleep might have preferentially facilitated semantic activations of concepts that had a suf ﬁ ciently strong activation be - foresleep , resulting in an accumulation of activation in the seman - tic memory network . This accumulation of activation during sleep may have helped the respective semantic concepts to cross the threshold of awareness , leading to an increase in the number of ex - plicitly named common associates after sleep . Semantic associations that were only very weakly activated beforesleep , ontheotherhand , mighthavebeenweakenedfurther and respective increases in connective strength from encoding might even have become nulli ﬁ ed during sleep . It has been sug - gested that sleep has an important function not only in the strengthening of relevant information but also in the forgetting of irrelevant information ( Crick and Mitchison 1983 ) . The synap - tic homeostasis hypothesis proposes that a central function of sleep is the restoration of synaptic homeostasis ( Tononi and Cirelli 2006 , 2014 ) . While wakefulness is characterized by an in - crease in synaptic strength through constant learning , sleep renormalizes the overall synaptic strength in a process of “ down - selection ” ( Tononi and Cirelli 2014 ) . During this process , all syn - apticconnectionsbecomedownscaled , whilerelativelystrongcon - nections might be downscaled to a lesser extent or might even be entirely protected from downscaling and very weak connections might be erased completely ( Hashmi et al . 2013 ; Nere et al . 2013 ) . Importantly , the basis for intuitive decisionsisthatweak ac - tivations of semantic concepts produce a feeling of coherence strong enough to decide upon intuitively even though no explicit reasons can be given . If sleep reduces or even eliminatestheseweak activations , there is not enough activation left to nurse the hunch necessary for intuition . Thus , sleep might help us extract explicit knowledge by strengthening suf ﬁ ciently activated associations , but concurrently erases the basis for intuitive judgments by elimi - nating weakly activated associations . Apart from the effect of sleep on explicit and intuitive judg - ments , we also observed a striking but unexpected effect of the en - coding duration . With a longer encoding duration , participants producedfewercommonassociates aswellas fewerintuitive coher - ence judgments compared with short encoding . In line with previ - ous evidence , it could be speculated that the longer encoding duration led to deeper conscious processing of the word triads , which may have disrupted or interfered with early automatic semantic activation of the common associates ( Topolinski and Strack 2008 ) . This idea should be systematically tested in future studies . A potential limitation of the present study relates to the com - parison of nighttime sleep with daytime wakefulness and the cor - responding circadian differences . Although we cannot fully excludethatcircadianfactorsaffectedthepresent ﬁ ndings , wecon - siderthisunlikelyasourcontroltasks ( measuring generalalertness , i . e . , objective vigilance and subjective sleepiness ) did not reveal any differences between groups . Moreover , a number of previous studies on sleep and memory , including one study on sleep and semantic processing , did not observe any circadian differences when directly controlling for such effects by introducing circadian control groups ( e . g . , Payne et al . 2008 ; Sio et al . 2013 ) . As another potential limitation , it should be considered that the two measures assessingexplicitsolutionsandintuitivejudgmentsmaynotbe en - tirely independent . Although both measures relied on different tri - al types and did not correlate , it is possible that the solved triads may have been somewhat easier , leaving the more dif ﬁ cult triads for the intuitive judgments . It is also possible that subjects judged certain triads as coherent intuitively at ﬁ rst , but then solved the tri - ads within the time of giving the coherence judgment ( yet this only rarely happened , in ∼ 8 % of triads on average ) . As a ﬁ nal lim - itation , with the present experimental design , wecannot disentan - gle potential mechanisms underlying sleep ’ s effect on semantic concepts . There are different possible scenarios how sleep may act on semantic processing ; ( 1 ) sleep may strengthen the encoded words , increasing the likelihood that the common associate is gen - erated spontaneously at testing , ( 2 ) sleep may directly strengthen the common associate that is generated already at encoding , ( 3 ) sleep may strengthen the associations between the encoded words and the concurrently activated common associate , or ( 4 ) sleep may directly generate the common associate via spreading ( re - ) activa - tion of the encoded words , etc . These questions will be subject to futurestudiesdirectlytesting andmanipulatingpotentialin ﬂ uenc - ing factors and mechanisms .
