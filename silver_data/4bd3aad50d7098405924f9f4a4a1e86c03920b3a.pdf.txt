Two mechanisms for the formation of filopodia have been suggested , each using different sets of actin - regulat - ing proteins , creating some controversy in the field . New molecules , some of unknown functions , have also been implicated in filopodium formation , suggesting that other possible mechanisms of filopodium formation exist . We discuss established and novel proteins that mediate the formation and dynamics of filopodia , different mechanisms of filopodium formation , and the various functions that distinct filopodia perform . Introduction Both polymerization and movement of the actin cytoskeleton are elaborately regulated by an expanding number of proteins that modulate polymerization , capping , severing , branching , bundling , contraction , and adhesion to the extracellular sub - strate . The actin - associated proteins present and active in a cell determine the types of filamentous actin ( F - actin ) – based struc - tures formed , including lamellipodia , filopodia , stress fibers , and podosomes ( 1 ) . Many of these structures have been the fo - cus of attention of the cell - migration community because of their involvement in leading - edge protrusion , cell body contrac - tion , and adhesion . With such a vast array of proteins that mod - ulate cytoskeletal dynamics , it is not surprising that many actin - based molecular machines exist . One of the best - described structures is the lamellipodium : a thin , densely branched mesh - work of F - actin behind the protruding cell edge with fast - grow - ing “barbed” filament ends oriented toward the direction of pro - trusion and migration ( 2 ) . The functions and interactions of many of the molecular players necessary for the formation of this structure , such as the Arp2 / 3 ( actin - related protein 2 and 3 ) complex and cofilin , have been elucidated ( 3 – 5 ) . The filopodium is another protruding F - actin – based struc - ture composed of parallel bundles of actin filaments that extend in a fingerlike manner beyond the cell edge ( 6 ) . Similar to the lamellipodium , the barbed ends of the actin filaments within the filopodium are oriented outward ( 6 ) . Filopodial protrusions and retractions are mediated by a dynamic balance of barbed - end polymerization and F - actin retrograde flow ( 7 ) . Therefore , regu - lation of F - actin polymerization at the filopodial tip and F - actin retrograde flow by contraction and adhesion control the forma - tion , maintenance , and dynamics of filopodia . There are a number of established regulators of filopodium formation and dynamics ( 8 ) , and several distinct mechanisms of filopodium formation have been proposed that involve different molecules , prompting some controversy in the field ( 9 – 11 ) . Several new molecules implicated in filopodium formation and dynamics have been described ; however , their functions in filopodium formation are not yet well understood ( 11 – 13 ) . This review focuses on estab - lished and novel molecules involved in filopodium formation , describes how these molecules are implicated in distinct mecha - nisms of filopodium initiation , and discusses contradictory findings in the field . Filopodium Function Filopodia participate in several fundamental physiological pro - cesses , such as wound healing , development , and cell signaling . Filopodia function by sensing chemicals in the environment ( 14 , 15 ) , acting as sites of signal transduction , and attaching to the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) . Contained within filopodia are receptors that detect diverse signals in the extracellular milieu ( 16 ) and initiate downstream signaling pathways leading to cel - lular responses . For example , filopodia can initiate the response to guidance cues , such as netrin , in neuronal growth cones , which are motile actin - and microtubule - rich structures at the ends of neurites that guide axons and dendrites to their proper targets ( 17 , 18 ) . Growth cone filopodia orient toward a gradient of guidance cues , an event that precedes the extension , turning , or branching of the growth cone – tipped neurite toward chemoattractants ( 17 , 19 , 20 ) . Some studies suggest , however , that filopodia are not required for all types of guidance respons - es ( 21 , 22 ) , indicating specificity in filopodia function . Dissoci - ated primary neurons on glass cover slips undergo a standard progression of morphologies to reach their mature state with one axon and several dendrites ( 23 ) . Filopodia appear to be es - sential for neurite initiation , when the precursors for axons and dendrites first form and extend from the neuronal cell body ( 24 , 25 ) . This suggests that filopodia function to establish neural cir - cuitry during development . Similarly , filopodia are central in the proper alignment and attachment of cells during the dorsal closure of Drosophila embryos ( 26 – 28 ) . Filopodia help cells to correctly align and adhere to their target partner and close the gap between them , a process known as “adhesion zippering” ( 28 , 29 ) , which also occurs in epithelial sheet fusion in Caenorhabditis elegans ( 30 ) and in cultured epithelial cells ( 31 ) . Interestingly , certain molecules involved with adhesion , such as integrins or cadherins , have long been known to associ - ate with filopodial tips ( 32 ) and along filopodial shafts ( 33 ) . Some filopodial tips even contain activated , yet unligated , β 1 in - tegrins ( 34 ) , which suggests that filopodia sense permissive substrates composed of ligands that allow adhesion , motility , or both . Filopodia act as points of attachment to the substrate and are also thought to produce tension across the ECM ( 35 , 36 ) , which could be used in guidance and migration . These diverse attributes make filopodia important factors in directed cell mi - gration during development and wound healing ( 26 – 28 ) . Filopodia : The Fingers That Do the Walking Stephanie L .

Mechanisms of filopodium initiation . ( A ) Convergent elongation model of filopodium initiation involves Arp2 / 3 - mediated F - actin branch formation , the F - actin – bundling activity of fascin , and the activities of Ena / VASP at barbed ends at the filopodial tip as an anti - capper , by protecting F - actin from capping proteins and promoting polymerization . These filopodia are anchored into the F - actin den - dritic meshwork . ( B ) De novo filament elongation is likely mediated by an F - actin nucleator and leaky capper , such as Dia2 . Dia2 pro - tects the barbed ends of F - actin from capping proteins , promotes bundling , and increases polymerization . F - actin bundling in these filopodia may also be modulated by fascin or other F - actin – bundling proteins , such as filamin , although this is currently unknown . These filopodia may also be anchored to the plasma membrane or cortical F - actin cytoskeleton through such proteins as IRSp53 or LPR1 . ( C ) The reorientation and elongation of peripheral F - actin bundles in neuronal growth cones could also induce filopodium initia - tion , modulated by several regulators of actin , including Ena / VASP proteins or Dia2 at the barbed ends , and fascin , filamin , or other F - actin crosslinkers along the shafts of filopodia . These filopodia are anchored in the peripheral actin bundles in the growth cone . Additionally , it is unclear whether these three mechanisms are independent and exclusive , or whether multiple mechanisms can be operating within the same cell . on M a y 1 , 2012 s t k e . sc i en c e m ag . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m www . stke . org / cgi / content / full / 2007 / 400 / re5 Page 3 Filopodium Structure and Dynamics A classic electron microscopy ( EM ) study carried out more than 30 years ago revealed a dense aggregation at the termini of microvilli ( 37 ) , which have since been seen by EM in filopodia ( 10 , 33 , 38 , 39 ) . These protein aggregates suggest the existence of a filopodium tip complex , presumed to either alter filopodial dynamics , or tether F - actin in filopodia to the corti - cal actin cytoskeleton in the plasma membrane , or both . Al - though this idea has persisted , the exact molecular composition of this complex is still largely unknown ; so , too , is whether dif - ferent filopodia have distinct tip complexes . Indeed , EM of filopodia from various cellular systems suggests that there are distinct architectures , depending on the cell type . Platinum - replica transmission EM of B16F1 melanoma cells revealed that F - actin within the lamellipodium meshwork becomes bundled and extends along the entire length of a filopodium to its tip ( 10 ) . In contrast , cryo - electron tomography of vitrified samples showed that the ultrastructure and architecture of the relatively fast - growing filopodia of Dictyostelium cells are quite different from the slower - growing filopodia of mammalian cells ( 40 ) . Filopodia in Dictyostelium contain ~ 10 short filaments that converge into a “terminal cone” within the filopodium tip that are not continuous with the parallel bundles of F - actin within the filopodium shaft . Interestingly , no actin filaments extend the complete length of the filopodia in these cells ( 40 ) . Whether this terminal cone of F - actin exists in other cell types but has not been observed because of harsher fixation conditions is un - clear . The authors suggest that this arrangement of F - actin with - in the filopodium is best for the force production needed in fast - growing filopodia . Estimating and comparing filopodia protrusion rates from Dictyostelium [ ~ 1 . 0 μ m / s ( 40 ) or ~ 0 . 03 μ m / s ( 41 ) ] with those of B16F1 melanoma tissue culture cells [ ~ 0 . 1 μ m / s ( 10 ) ] , neuroblastoma cells [ ~ 0 . 04 to 0 . 1 μ m / s ( 7 ) ] , and primary hippocampal neurons [ < 0 . 1 μ m / s ( 42 ) ] indicate that filopodial dynamics differ by orders of magnitude among different cell types . Mathematical models predict that the fac - tors that enhance the protrusion speed include thermal fluctua - tions of the membrane , the number and spatial arrangement of the filaments in the bundle , and whether the filaments are teth - ered to the membrane ( 43 ) . Considering the diversity in the ar - chitecture and dynamics of filopodia , it is not surprising that distinct sets of molecules are implicated in filopodium forma - tion . Thus , diverse sets of actin - associated proteins may be as - sociated with filopodial tip complexes of differing structural and dynamic characteristics , and possibly functions that are suited to the needs of particular cell types . It will be interesting to determine those sets of proteins that are associated with par - ticular attributes and functions . Filopodium Initiation and Maintenance Mechanisms of filopodium initiation . To date , two mechanisms that use distinct actin - nucleating proteins have been proposed for filopodium initiation ( Fig . 1 ) . In the “convergent elonga - tion” model ( Fig . 1A ) ( 10 ) , filopodia are initiated by established F - actin regulators , including Arp2 / 3 complex – mediated nucle - ation downstream of the signaling of the Rho guanosine triphosphatase ( GTPase ) Cdc42 , Enabled ( Ena ) / VASP ( va - sodilator - stimulated phosphoprotein ) at filopodial tips , and fascin along filopodia shafts , whereas the opposing model pro - poses that Dia2 performs most , if not all , of these functions . In the convergent elongation model of filopodium initiation , filopodia form from a gradual association of a subset of branched lamellipodial filaments at their barbed ends that are decorated with Ena / VASP proteins . Association of Ena / VASP proteins with the barbed ends of filaments may mark F - actin for subsequent filopodium formation , presumably by clustering barbed ends together , protecting them from capping , and per - mitting rapid polymerization ( 10 ) , and possibly bundling fila - ments ( 44 – 46 ) . The binding of fascin converts the filaments in - to bundled filopodia and stabilizes them . After filopodium for - mation in B16F1 melanoma cells , microtubules extend toward the proximal termini of filopodia . These events correlate with filopodial turning and merging ( 47 ) . Thus , microtubules may mediate the lateral movement of filopodia , their merging , and thus , their density . Because many of the players involved in the convergent elongation model have been described in great detail , we will discuss these first . Cdc42 directly interacts with and activates Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ) family proteins , which , in turn , activate the Arp2 / 3 complex ( 48 , 49 ) . The Arp2 / 3 complex subsequently binds to the side of an actin fila - ment and nucleates a new filament as a branch from the mother filament . Although it seems counterintuitive that a complex that nucleates filament branches should be involved in the formation of parallel bundles of F - actin , several studies have suggested that filopodia arise from the branched F - actin meshwork of the lamellipodium ( 10 ) , as opposed to arising from de novo fila - ment nucleation . Evidence for this model has been provided by elegant time - lapse fluorescence microscopy and EM ( 10 ) ; how - ever , genetic data supporting this model are lacking . Interest - ingly , studies that have suggested that filopodia form in the ab - sence of Arp2 / 3 ( 9 , 50 , 51 ) , and its activator WASP / N - WASP ( 52 , 53 ) , bring into question the role of Arp2 / 3 and convergent elongation . The Ena / VASP family of proteins also has a well - established role in the formation and maintenance of filopodia , though the precise nature of EnaVASP function remains controversial ( 42 , 46 , 54 , 55 ) . These proteins concentrate along the leading edge ( 56 , 57 ) and in the tips of filopodia ( 58 ) , both of which are characterized by high actin dynamics . Ena / VASP proteins bind both monomeric actin ( G - actin ) and F - actin ( 44 , 45 , 59 ) . Ena / VASP proteins also bundle F - actin ( 45 , 46 , 59 , 60 ) and may cluster barbed ends ( 54 ) . Studies using mouse embryonic fibroblasts MV D7 cells ( 61 ) , which are genetically deficient for Mena and VASP and have only trace amounts of the Ena / VASP family member Evl , have revealed new information about this protein family . MV D7 cells show impaired regulation of lamel - lipodium and filopodium formation , but when exogenously ex - pressed at physiological levels , these functions are restored . Ena / VASP family members stably localize at filopodial tips . Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) studies re - veal that these proteins have long residence times at filopodial tips and that this localization is lost in G - actin domain mutants ( 54 ) , suggesting that the binding of G - actin is necessary for barbed - end association . Ena / VASP proteins can also prevent fil - ament capping by capping protein , while permitting polymer - ization ( 59 , 62 ) , although this issue remains controversial ( 46 , 63 ) . Although the molecular mechanism of Ena / VASP activity is unclear owing to the use of different experimental conditions in various studies , it is clear that Ena / VASP activity increases the number , length , and growth rates of filopodia in many cell types ( 42 , 55 , 64 , 65 ) and the formation of neurites subsequent R E V I E W on M a y 1 , 2012 s t k e . sc i en c e m ag . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m www . stke . org / cgi / content / full / 2007 / 400 / re5 Page 4 to filopodium formation in primary neurons ( 42 ) . Deletion of the F - actin binding motif of the one Ena / VASP ortholog in Dic - tyostelium blocks filopodium formation . Although this was in - terpreted as indicative of an exclusive role for bundling in filopodium formation ( 46 ) , the same motif is required for F - actin binding and the prevention of capping ( 59 ) . More sophisti - cated methods will be needed to resolve whether Ena / VASP’s role in filopodium formation is anticapping , F - actin binding , or bundling , or some combination of these . Interestingly , another study has suggested that filopodia form in the absence of Ena / VASP ( 66 ) ( Fig . 1B ) , although this needs to be confirmed in a true genetic knockout . In light of this and previously men - tioned studies , the convergent elongation model is not sufficient to explain the formation of all filopodia . The final component of the convergent elongation model is the actin - bundling protein , fascin . Because filopodia are paral - lel , bundled arrays of F - actin , it is not surprising that fascin , an F - actin – crosslinking protein , is associated with filopodia in many cell types ( 67 – 69 ) . Although there are many other pro - teins that crosslink and bundle F - actin , such as fimbrin , filamin , and α - actinin , RNA interference ( RNAi ) studies in B16F1 mouse melanoma cells have shown that knockdown of fascin inhibits the formation of filopodia and resolvable F - actin bun - dles along the cell edge , suggesting that fascin is critical for filopodium formation ( 70 ) . It will be interesting to determine whether other actin - crosslinking proteins form filopodia or whether fascin is always required . Another mechanism for the formation of filopodia involves the Diaphanous - related formin , Dia2 ( 50 ) . In vitro Dia2 nucleates linear actin filaments , accelerates actin polymerization ( 71 , 72 ) , slows filament depolymerization ( 73 ) , protects barbed ends from capping proteins ( 74 , 75 ) , and bundles F - actin ( 76 ) . Interestingly , all of these actin - modulating activities also occur in the conver - gent elongation model . Overexpression of Dia2 induces the for - mation of filopodia in a range of cell types from Dictyostelium to NIH3T3 cells ( 74 , 77 , 78 ) . Importantly , knockout studies showed that Dia2 is essential for filopodium formation in Dictyostelium ( 74 ) . In the proposed mechanism of Dia2 - mediated filopodium formation , filopodia arise as a result of de novo filament nucle - ation , although whether this occurs in vivo is unclear . It will be interesting to determine which functions Dia2 performs during this alternative mechanism of filopodium formation . In addition , in Dictyostelium it appears that both Dia2 and the single VASP ortholog cooperate during filopodium formation ( 46 ) , which rais - es the question of whether these two mechanisms of filopodium initiation are independent , or whether Dictyostelium form filopo - dia by yet another mechanism . Signaling in filopodium initiation . The small Rho GTPases Rac , Rho , and Cdc42 are established regulators of the actin cy - toskeleton . Whereas Rac activity promotes the protrusion of the lamellipodium , Rho is implicated in the formation and contrac - tion of contractile actin structures , and Cdc42 has long been suggested to control the formation and protrusion of the filopodium ( 79 – 81 ) . It is still unclear whether Cdc42 is neces - sary for filopodium formation , as is the mechanism by which it acts , because experiments implicating Cdc42 in filopodium for - mation have mostly involved overexpression of constitutively active or dominant negative mutants of Cdc42 ( 79 – 81 ) . Filopo - dia still form in cells lacking Cdc42 , as well as cells lacking its effector WASP ( 52 , 53 , 82 ) . Other cell types lacking Cdc42 are devoid of filopodia ( 79 ) . Determining whether Cdc42 activation induces filopodium formation in the absence of WASP activity will be of great interest . The small Rho GTPase Rif ( Rho in filopodia ) is also impli - cated in filopodium formation . Similar to Cdc42 , overexpres - sion of Rif induces the formation of filopodia , but these filopo - dia are long and project from the apical cell surface and the cell periphery ( 50 , 83 ) , whereas Cdc42 - induced filopodia are short - er and do not project from the apical cell surface ( 81 , 84 ) . Rif binds to and activates Dia2 , and filopodia formed through Rif and Dia2 are independent of Cdc42 , WASP , and Arp2 / 3 activi - ties ( 50 ) . This further supports the hypothesis that alternative mechanisms , in addition to convergent elongation , exist . Be - cause Cdc42 can also bind to and activate Dia2 ( 77 ) , it is un - clear whether activation of Dia2 by Cdc42 or Rif is the more physiologically relevant mechanism . It will be interesting to de - termine if filopodium induction by Dia2 is typically associated with activation by Cdc42 or Rif , whether its filopodium - induc - ing activity is always independent of Arp2 / 3 , and whether fascin is involved in formation or maintanence of these filopodia . It is also unclear whether there are multiple possible mechanisms downstream of these signals that lead to filopodium formation . Other studies have found additional small Rho GTPases that induce filopodium formation . For example , in fibroblasts , exoge - nously expressed TC10 , another small Rho GTPase , induces the formation of filopodia that are longer than typical Cdc42 - induced filopodia , whereas RhoT produces even longer and thicker filopodia ( 85 ) . However , in porcine aortic endothelial cells , ex - ogenous expression of constitutively active TC10 results in the formation of focal adhesion - like structures and not filopodium - like structures , and Wrch - 1 expression induces long and thin filopodia . This study also showed that cells expressing constitu - tively active RhoD and Rif have extremely long and flexible filopodia , but the same is not true for cells that express RhoT ( 86 ) . Clearly , more studies on these GTPases are warranted . Al - though there are multiple Rho GTPases that induce filopodium formation when constitutively active , it is unclear which of these GTPases play a physiological role in filopodium formation , and whether they act upstream of several different mechanisms or converge on similar mechanisms of filopodium formation . New Players in Filopodium Initiation Myosin X . Although many of the proteins mentioned above in - duce the formation of filopodia in relatively well - characterized mechanisms , new players have been discovered that induce filopodium formation by unknown mechanisms . For example , myosin X is an actin - associated protein implicated in filopodi - um formation and function that localizes to the tips of filopo - dia . Overexpression of full - length myosin X increases the num - bers of both substrate - bound filopodia and dorsal filopodia in various cell types ( 87 ) . Myosin X moves up and down filopodia shafts , an activity known as intrafilopodial motility ( 87 , 88 ) . Myosin X moves forward by “walking” along actin filaments toward the barbed ends , whereas its rearward movement is due to the retrograde flow of F - actin to which myosin X is tightly bound . Myosin X may therefore shuttle molecules within filopodia . Indeed , it has several interesting binding partners that could affect filopodium formation . Myosin X may transport Ena / VASP proteins to the tips of filopodia ( 89 ) to increase F - actin polymerization , clustering , and protection from cap - ping . However , myosin X can induce filopodia independently of Ena / VASP in MV D7 cells ( 66 ) . Myosin X also binds to β inte - R E V I E W on M a y 1 , 2012 s t k e . sc i en c e m ag . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m www . stke . org / cgi / content / full / 2007 / 400 / re5 Page 5 grins and may transport these adhesive molecules to tips of filopodia , possibly inducing filopodium formation by increas - ing adhesion to the substrate ( 90 ) . Myosin X also binds micro - tubules ( 91 ) , and therefore may crosslink microtubules to F - actin , one possible mechanism mediating the targeting of microtubules to the proximal ends of filopodia discussed previously ( 47 ) . It will be useful to determine which of these binding partners are involved in myosin X – mediated filopodium induction . Ror2 . Another player in the formation of the filopodium is Ror2 , a receptor tyrosine kinase activated downstream of Wnt5a , which is expressed in neural crest – derived and mes - enchymal cells during embryogenesis ( 92 ) and is essential for morphogenesis ( 93 , 94 ) . The C . elegans ortholog , CAM - 1 , is al - so involved in cell migration and axonal elongation ( 95 ) . When expressed ectopically in various cell types , Ror2 stimulates the formation of an increased number of filopodia and colocalizes with F - actin in filopodia ( 13 ) . This activity is not dependent on the tyrosine kinase activity of Ror2 , but rather is depen - dent on its association with the F - actin – crosslinking protein , filamin A , which is found at the root of a filopodium , and presumably Wnt5a signaling . Indeed , the association of fil - amin A and Ror2 , and possibly the downstream induction of filopodia , are necessary for Wnt5a - dependent cell migration , suggesting that filopodia play an important role in cell migra - tion in some cell types and , further , that filopodia can act downstream of a number of signaling pathways . It will be in - teresting to determine whether Ror2 - induced filopodia are in - dependent of fascin - mediated F - actin bundling , owing to the mandatory interaction of Ror2 with filamin to induce these filopodia . This would suggest that fascin is not the only F - actin – bundling or F - actin – crosslinking protein able to medi - ate the formation of filopodia . LPR1 . Another initiator of filopodium formation is the inte - gral membrane protein lipid phosphatase – related protein 1 ( LPR1 ) , which induces filopodium formation in an unknown manner but is independent of Cdc42 , Rif , Arp2 / 3 , and Ena / VASP ( MV D7 cells ) . LPRs typically either dephosphorylate lipid phosphates or catalyze transphosphatidylation reactions ; however , LPR1 is catalytically inactive ( 11 ) . LPR1 localizes to internal membranes ( likely the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi ) and to the plasma membrane , particularly along the lengths of filopodia ( 11 ) , and its overexpression in both HeLa and Cos - 7 cells is associated with a large increase in the num - ber of peripheral and dorsal filopodia . Although the typical filopodial markers mentioned above are absent from LPR1 - in - duced filopodia , myosin X localizes to the tips and fascin is found along the lengths of the filopodia , suggesting that there may be many permutations of molecules present in filopodial tip complexes . LPR1 - induced filopodia appear to be more per - sistent , longer , thinner , and more motile than those induced by Cdc42 and occur on peripheral and dorsal surfaces , further sug - gesting that different mechanisms of filopodium formation like - ly produce filopodia with different attributes and functions . Per - haps LPR1 anchors the cytoskeletal architecture within filo - podia to the plasma membrane or cortical actin cytoskeleton ? Further characterization of the biochemical characteristics of LPR1 will be needed to reveal possible mechanisms of its in - volvement in filopodium formation , as well as whether LPR1 induction of filopodia requires the presence of myosin X , fascin , or other filopodium - associated proteins . IRSp53 . The insulin receptor tyrosine kinase substrate p53 ( IRSp53 ) is also implicated in the formation of filopodia , although there is some disagreement about its possible mecha - nisms of action ( 96 , 97 ) . IRSp53 contains an IMD [ a lipid binding domain found in both IRSp53 and missing - in - metas - tasis ( MIM ) ] at its N terminus that has several possible func - tions including Rac binding , ( 98 ) , F - actin bundling ( 99 ) , and lipid binding ( 12 ) . IRSp53 also contains a central Src - homo - logy 3 ( SH3 ) domain through which it binds WAVE2 ( WASP - family protein member 2 , and a C - terminal WASP homology domain - 2 ( WH2 ) that binds with high affinity to G - actin ( 100 ) . IRSp53 also binds to Rac and Cdc42 through its N terminus ( 80 ) . One possible mechanism for the induction of a filopodium by IRSp53 is through downstream activation of Arp2 / 3 actin - nucleating activity by the interaction of IRSp53 with the WAVE2 complex ( 96 ) , which may initiate a convergent elongation mechanism of filopodia formation . Alternatively , another study suggested that the IMD domain of IRSp53 induces F - actin bundling in vitro and in tissue culture cells ( 99 ) . The induction of filopodium formation by Cdc42 in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts is dependent on the IMD region of IRSp53 ( 80 ) , and induction is enhanced in the presence of Ena / VASP , possibly by IMD - mediated binding of IRSp53 to Ena / VASP . Cdc42 - induced filopodium formation in HeLa cells requires both IRSp53 and Epsin - 8 ( Eps8 ) . Eps8 is also known to regulate actin dynamics by binding to the barbed ends of F - actin and crosslinking F - actin . The interaction of IRSp53 with Eps8 synergistically increases the F - actin bundling of both proteins in vitro ( 99 ) . These studies suggest that IRSp53 functions in filopodium formation through its F - actin – bundling activity , which is mediated by the IMD . However , a recent study questions the relevance of IMD - induced F - actin bundling to filopodium formation and pro - vides an alternative role for this domain . The IMD also inter - acts with phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate [ PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ] and is structurally similar to the lipid - binding BAR ( Bin / am - phiphysin / Rvs ) domain of other proteins that typically invaginate the plasma membrane ( 101 ) . Because the lipid - binding interface of the IMD of IRSp53 and BAR domains display opposite curvatures , it is not surprising that the IMD forms membrane tubes instead of invaginations ( 12 ) . Indeed , this study showed that IMD - mediated induction of filopodia in U2OS osteosarcoma tissue culture cells does not depend on its F - actin – bundling activity , but rather depends solely on its membrane - curving function ( 12 ) , suggesting that F - actin bundling may not be the relevant mechanism for IRSp53 - in - duced filopodium formation . Careful measurement by EM of the ultrastructure of filopodia induced by IRSp53 may distinguish between the possible mechanisms , because mem - brane tubes induced by the IMD have a characteristic width . It will be interesting to clarify which of the different domains and binding partners of IRSp53 are necessary for its induction of filopodium formation , and whether this pro - tein can act through several distinct mechanisms . The inter - actions between IRSp53 and its binding partners could also link F - actin within filopodia to the plasma membrane and cortical cytoskeleton . Alternative Mechanisms of Filopodium Formation To summarize , recent progress in this field has uncovered a multitude of previously unknown proteins associated with R E V I E W on M a y 1 , 2012 s t k e . sc i en c e m ag . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m www . stke . org / cgi / content / full / 2007 / 400 / re5 Page 6 filopodium formation and suggested that there may be multiple mechanisms of filopodium formation . Although convergent elongation ( Fig . 1A ) might be an important pathway for filopodium formation in some cells , it cannot be the sole path - way . Another possible mechanism involves de novo filament nucleation , likely by Dia2 or other formin proteins , and the sub - sequent polymerization and bundling of filaments ( Fig . 1B ) . A third alternative , particularly in neuronal growth cones , is the formation of filopodia from the reorientation and rapid poly - merization of peripheral actin bundles toward the cell edge ( Fig . 1C ) . Neuronal growth cones contain many transverse F - actin bundles ( 102 ) . It would be interesting to determine whether these bundles can reorient perpendicular to the cell edge and initiate filopodium formation . Another likely possibility , due to the overlapping functions of the many actin - associated proteins , is that different sets of proteins might form filopodia by related mechanisms . Because polymerization and bundling are affected by a plethora of proteins associated with the filopodial tip com - plex and along the length of the filopodium , these functions may simply depend on which proteins are present and active within a particular cell . Reconstitution of filopodia in vitro with distinct sets of proteins will be enlightening in determining a mandatory set of proteins or protein functions required for filopodium formation . Why should multiple mechanisms for filopodium forma - tion exist ? The expression profile of a particular cell type will determine the mechanisms available for filopodium forma - tion . Similarly , the architecture of a cell may influence the type of mechanism used . For example , cells that are charac - terized by a highly branched F - actin meshwork mediated by Arp2 / 3 , such as fibroblasts , may use a convergent elongation mechanism for filopodium formation , because most of the F - actin near their cell edges is in a meshwork configuration . Certain cell types lack highly branched actin meshworks , yet still form filopodia ( 6 ) . For example , hippocampal neuronal growth cones plated on poly - D - lysine are characterized by peripheral F - actin bundles as opposed to densely branched F - actin meshworks . Inhibition of Arp2 / 3 complex activity in such neurons does not block filopodium elaboration ( 51 , 103 ) . Dorsal root ganglion neurons plated on laminin , howev - er , have Arp2 / 3 and branched F - actin in the lamellipodial veils of growth cones , and this suggests , in this context , that Arp2 / 3 may play a role in filopodium formation ( 104 ) . Other cell types have prominent stress fibers or F - actin bundles instead of F - actin meshworks , and these cells may use an alternative mechanism for filopodium initiation , such as re - orientation or extension of preexisting F - actin bundles toward the cell periphery , or both . Are All Filopodia Created Equal ? One feature that differs among filopodia formed by these differ - ent molecular mechanisms is the manner in which the filopodia are anchored into the cellular architecture ( Fig . 1 ) . For example , a filopodium formed through convergent elongation is anchored into the lamellipodium F - actin meshwork , but in the case of neuronal growth cones , filopodia are anchored into peripheral actin bundles . It is unknown , however , how filopodia formed from de novo filament nucleation are anchored . In light of stud - ies that showed that membrane proteins such as LPR1 and IR - Sp53 play roles in the formation of the filopodium , we suggest that these and other similar proteins anchor the filopodium tip or shaft into cortical F - actin and the plasma membrane . The manner in which filopodia are anchored within the cell could affect the downstream functions of filopodia . How else might filopodia formed by distinct mechanisms dif - fer in their behavior and function ? One possibility is that inte - grins and other cell - adhesion molecules only associate with the tips of filopodia that are formed by particular mechanisms . This might determine which ECM components the filopodia attach to , and which downstream signaling pathways are activated after at - tachment . Similarly , the structural and signaling proteins within a filopodium might determine which external signals , such as growth factors or guidance cues , the filopodium responds to and how that response is controlled . One could also imagine that the molecules present in the filopodium alter both its biochemical and biophysical properties . For example , the types and numbers of F - actin – bundling or F - actin – crosslinking proteins and the number of actin filaments would greatly affect the persistence length or stiffness of filopodia . These factors may then influence how filopodia respond to external mechanical cues , such as ob - stacles or shear stress , and how downstream signals are activated . Future Directions An important goal for the field is to determine the complete molecular inventory of filopodia and the filopodial tip com - plexes found in diverse cell types . Similar studies have revealed information about the molecular machinery of pseudopodia ( 105 ) . Further characterization of the different players and mechanisms of filopodium formation will clarify the indepen - dence of different mechanisms , determine whether filopodia formed by different mechanisms have distinct functions , and determine how certain parameters of filopodial behavior , such as length , width , growth rate , and persistence , depend on the mechanism of formation . The involvement of so many molecules in filopodium formation begs the question of whether different mechanisms of filopodium formation evolved independently or were modified over time . Determining a molecular inventory for the many modes of filopodium forma - tion among organisms from Dictyostelium to mammals and in - specting them for commonalities and divergence will likely yield new insight into the mechanisms of filopodium formation . Although all of the molecules involved in filopodium formation have not yet been revealed , it seems highly unlikely that a single mechanism of filopodium formation accounts for the diverse structures , behaviors , and functions of filopodia that occur in a range of cell types and organisms .
