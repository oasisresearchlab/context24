Volume 1 ( Monographs in Theoretical Computer Science . An EATCS Series ) Kurt Jensen Coloured Petri Nets : Basic Concepts , Analysis Methods and Practical Use . Volume 1 ( Monographs in Theoretical Computer Science . An EATCS Series ) Kurt Jensen This book presents a coherent description of the theoretical and practical aspects of Coloured Petri Nets ( CP - nets or CPN ) . It shows how CP - nets have been de veloped - from being a promising theoretical model to being a full - fledged lan guage for the design , specification , simulation , validation and implementation of large software systems ( and other systems in which human beings and / or com puters communicate by means of some more or less formal rules ) . The book contains the formal definition of CP - nets and the mathematical theory behind their analysis methods . However , it has been the intention to write the book in such a way that it also becomes attractive to readers who are more interested in applications than the underlying mathematics . This means that a large part of the book is written in a style which is closer to an engineering textbook ( or a users ' manual ) than it is to a typical textbook in theoretical computer science . The book consists of three separate volumes . The first volume defines the net model ( i . e . , hierarchical CP - nets ) and the basic concepts ( e . g . , the different behavioural properties such as deadlocks , fair ness and home markings ) . It gives a detailed presentation of many small exam ples and a brief overview of some industrial applications . It introduces the for mal analysis methods . Finally , it contains a description of a set of CPN tools which support the practical use of CP - nets .
