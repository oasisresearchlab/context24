A R T I C L E S BAP31 and BiP are essential for dislocation of SV40 from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cytosol Roger Geiger 1 , Daniel Andritschke 1 , Sarah Friebe 1 , Fabian Herzog 1 , Stefania Luisoni 1 , Thomas Heger 1 and Ari Helenius 1 , 2 How non - enveloped viruses overcome host cell membranes is poorly understood . Here , we show that after endocytosis and transport to the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) , but before crossing the ER membrane to the cytosol , incoming simian virus 40 particles are structurally remodelled leading to exposure of the amino - terminal sequence of the minor viral protein VP2 . These hydrophobic sequences anchor the virus to membranes . A negatively charged residue , Glu 17 , in the α - helical , membrane - embedded peptide is essential for infection , most likely by introducing an ‘irregularity’ recognized by the ER - associated degradation ( ERAD ) system for membrane proteins . Using a siRNA - mediated screen , the lumenal chaperone BiP and the ER - membrane protein BAP31 ( both involved in ERAD ) were identiﬁed as being essential for infection . They co - localized with the virus in discrete foci and promoted its ER - to - cytosol dislocation . Virus - like particles devoid of VP2 failed to cross the membrane . The results demonstrated that ERAD - factors assist virus transport across the ER membrane . Simian virus 40 ( SV40 ) is a member of the polyomaviruses , a family of small , non - enveloped DNA viruses , of which some are human pathogens 1 – 3 . The icosahedral capsid with a diameter of 45nm is composed of 72 VP1 pentamers 4 stabilized by a network of interpentameric disulphide bonds 5 , 6 . In an internal cavity , each pentamer carries another structural protein , either VP2 or VP3 , which are hydrophobic 7 and not exposed on the virus surface . VP2 and VP3 differ in their N terminus in that VP2 contains 118 additional amino acids and an N - terminal myristyl group 8 . The DNA genome is circular andlocatedinsidetheviralcapsidassociatedwithnucleosomes 9 . To infect cells , SV40 binds through the VP1 pentamers to the carbohydrate moiety of ganglioside GM1 at the plasma membrane , and is transported by endosomes to the lumen of the ER ( refs 10 – 14 ) . After isomerization of interpentameric disulphide bonds by the oxidoreductase ERp57 ( ref . 6 ) , the virus penetrates the ER membrane to access the cytosol from which it is imported into the nucleus 15 – 17 . The membrane penetration step is not understood , nor is it known in which form the virus exits the ER . Here , we studied this process and found that SV40 capsids undergo a major conformational change in the lumen of the ER . To cross the membrane , SV40 takes advantage of ERAD machinery dedicated to the identification and removal of aberrant membrane proteins 18 – 23 . RESULTS SV40 undergoes a conformational change in the ER Electron micrographs indicated that SV40 underwent a structural change after reaching the ER of CV - 1 cells .

Moreover , the characteristic of intimate membrane association with GM1 was lost ; the distance between the particle surface and the membrane increased to 7 ± 2nm . Occasionally , radial densities between the virus and the ER membrane were observed ( Fig . 1b , yellow arrow ) . In addition , the ER membrane around the particles often appeared angular and was present as flattened surfaces tangential to the virus surface ( Fig . 1c , arrows ) . ER lumenal extract promotes uncoating and liposome binding To analyse the effects of lumenal proteins , purified virus particles were incubated in vitro with ER lumenal extracts from dog pancreas microsomes 24 , 25 . The morphology after negative - staining electron microscopy ( Fig . 1e ) showed smaller and often deformed particles ( Fig . 1f ) . The viral DNA not extractable from intact virus particles using phenol – chloroform extraction could now be efficiently extracted ( Supplementary Fig . S1a ) . We concluded that factors in the ER lumen induced a destabilizing structural change in the virus . To analyse whether the changes resulted in affinity for membranes , incubation of SV40 with ER lumenal extract was followed by the addition of liposomes with an ER - like lipid composition . To separate liposome - bound from unbound viruses , the liposomes were floated by ultracentrifugation ( Fig . 1g ) . When top and bottom fractions were analysed by western blotting , about 25 % of VP1 and VP3 were found with the liposomes ( Fig . 1h ) . Real - time PCR ( rtPCR ) analysis showed that virions that associated with liposomes contained the DNA genome NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 13 | NUMBER 11 | NOVEMBER 2011 1305 © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited .

Samples were overlaid with a step gradient followed by ultracentrifugation to separate membrane - bound virions ( top fraction ) from unbound virions ( bottom ) . Fractions were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and subjected to SDS – PAGE and western blotting with VP1 and VP3 antibodies . ( i ) Virions were treated as indicated and processed as in h . Instead of precipitation with trichloroacetic acid , top fractions were subjected to phenol – chloroform extraction and the DNA content was determined by quantitative rtPCR . The DNA concentration measured in the top fraction after treatment of SV40 with buffer was set to 1 . All other data points are relative to it . n = 12 ( for buffer and lumenal extract , LE ) , or n = 6 ( for heat - inactivated LE ) . Error bars represent the s . e . m .

Uncropped images of blots are shown in Supplementary Fig . S7 . ( Fig . 1i ) . After incubation with buffer , the viruses were absent from top fractions . Virus - like particles ( VLPs ) devoid of VP2 and 3 were detected only in bottom fractions , indicating that the inner structural proteins were needed for capsid binding to liposomes . The N terminus of VP2 inserts into the membrane To define the viral factor involved in liposome binding , we focused on VP2 , which has three hydrophobic sequences predicted to form transmembrane domains ( Fig . 2a , bold ) . Of them , the hydrophobic N - terminal peptide carries a myristyl group 8 . In the related mouse polyomavirus 26 ( mPy ) , the VP2 protein is lodged within the axial cavity of the VP1 pentamer , and the N terminus is unstructured . We raised polyclonal antibodies against peptides corresponding to 17 N - terminal and carboxy - terminal amino acids of VP2 , respectively ( N1 and C1 ) . When viruses were exposed to ER lumenal extracts in the presence of the C1 antibody , liposome binding occurred ( Fig . 1j ) . In contrast , when the N1 antibody was added , binding was significantly inhibited . This indicated that liposome binding involved exposure of the N - terminal peptide of VP2 . The secondary structure of a synthetic peptide identical to the first 29 amino acids of VP2 was analysed by circular dichroism spectroscopy ( Supplementary Fig . S1c ) . Our data indicated that the peptide adopted an α - helical conformation when associated with amphiphiles and lipids . As secondary structure predictions indicated that the 18 N - terminal amino acids of the VP2 form an amphipathic α - helix ( Fig . 2b ) , it was conceivable that the peptide binds to a single leaflet before inserting deeper into the bilayer . To determine whether the N - terminal peptide of VP2 ( residues 1 – 31 ) is sufficient for membrane association in live cells , we generated constructs in which it was fused either to the N or C terminus of GFP . Microsomal pellets from cells expressing these constructs were analysed by immunoblotting . Whereas GFP without the peptide was exclusively in the supernatant , both fusion proteins occurred in pellet fractions ( Fig . 2c ) .

Only after solubilization with 1 % Triton X - 100 were the fusion protein and an internal control , calnexin , predominantly in the supernatant . This indicated that the N - terminal peptide of VP2 is sufficient to convert GFP , a soluble protein , into an integral membrane protein . A negatively charged residue in the N terminus of VP2 is essential for infection The hydrophobic N terminus of VP2 contains two charged residues ( Asp10andGlu17 ) conservedamongpolyomaviruses ( Supplementary Fig . S1b ) . As charged residues in transmembrane segments are known to act as ER - retention and - degradation signals 27 , 28 , we investigated whether these were critical for infection . The infection level of VP2 D10A mutant viruses was similar to wild - type virions ( Fig . 2e ) . In contrast , VP2 E17A mutants were not infectious . The same was observed for a double mutant VP2 D10A / E17A , and for a VP2 E17Q mutant . Interestingly , when Glu 17 was replaced by a positively charged residue as in E17R and E17K mutants , the viruses were infectious albeit at reduced levels ( 70 – 80 % ofwildtype ) . Asimilarlevelofinfectivitywasfoundforviruses devoid of the myristylation site ( G2A , Fig . 2e ) . Further analysis of the VP2 E17A mutant viruses showed that the particlescontainedtheviralDNAandsedimentedsimilarlytowild - type virions ( Supplementary Fig . S2a – d ) . Although they bound to CV - 1 cells with an efficiency similar to wild - type virus , they did not infect them ( Supplementary Fig . S2e – h ) . VP1 is required for transport to the ER and VP2 is required for transit across the membrane To follow the trafficking of SV40 to the ER and cytosol , we labelled isolated viruses with a small chemical compound ( benzylguanine , BG ) , which forms a covalent bond with a reporter protein called SNAP ( ref . 29 ; Fig . 2f ) . Myc - tagged SNAP was expressed in CV - 1 cells , and targetedtotheERbyanER - signalsequenceandaKDEL - retrievalsignal .

Bottom , HeLa cells ( a , c – h ) or CV1 cells ( b ) were transfected with the indicated siRNAs as described above and lysed after 72h . Cell lysate ( 20 µ g ) was analysed by SDS – PAGE and western blot analysis using antibodies against the target protein and a control protein ( tubulin or actin ) . ( d ) The siRNA RMA1 _ A1 presumably induces an off - target effect , because infection is blocked but RMA1 expression was not affected . RMA1 _ A3 and RMA1 _ 7 inhibit infection proportional to the RMA1 knockdown .

Under these conditions , a covalent linkage product between a BG - tagged virus protein and SNAP can form only if the virus reaches the ER . ER - SNAP - expressing cells were inoculated with BG - labelled SV40 for 24 h , lysed and subjected to SDS – polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS – PAGE ) followedbyimmunoblotanalysisusingantibodiesagainst the Myc epitope of ER - SNAP . Several bands at relative molecular massesof60 , 000 ( M r 60K ) andhigherappeared , indicatingthatcovalent crosslinkage products between SNAP ( M r 20K ) and VP1 ( M r 41K ) were present ( Fig . 2g ) . They were absent when SNAP was not expressed , when cells were not inoculated with BG – SV40 and when trafficking to the ER was blocked by brefeldin A ( BFA ) . Next , we used the SNAP assay to determine whether VLPs devoid of VP2 and 3 traffic to the ER . BG - labelled VLPs induced the formation of several crosslinkage products similar to BG – SV40 ( Fig . 2h ) , indicating that VP1 is sufficient to target SV40 capsids to the ER . Then , Myc - tagged SNAP was expressed in the cytosol ( Supplemen - tary Fig . S2k ) . When cells were inoculated with BG – SV40 and analysed as above , a faint band migrating at M r 60K was detected ( Fig . 2i ) . This indicated that a small fraction of VP1 traversed the ER membrane into the cytosol . Unlike intact virus , VLPs did not escape into the cytosol , as no SNAP – VP1 linkage product was observed . The SNAP experiments showed that VP2 is dispensable for SV40 trafficking to the ER , but particles devoid of VP2 and 3 do not reach the cytosol , consistent with arolefortheN - terminalsequenceandGlu17ofVP2inERescape . SV40 infection depends on the ER proteins BAP31 , BAP29 and RMA1 To identify proteins that assist SV40 infection , we silenced 34 ER factors in HeLa cells one by one using siRNAs and tested infection . ( The entire list of siRNAs and their effects on infection and cell numbers can be found in Supplementary Table S1 . ) BAP31 ( also known as BCAP31 , B - cell receptor - associated protein 31 ) was the strongest hit in the screen ; all six siRNAs strongly decreased the level of infection without affecting cell viability . Western blot analysis showed that each siRNA efficiently silenced BAP31 expression ( Fig . 3a ) . Similar results were obtained when CV - 1 cells were used ( Fig . 3b ) . BAP31 is an M r 31K membrane protein with three predicted transmembrane segments , and an M r 13K cytosolic domain . It is the most abundant ER membrane protein 30 , and forms high - molecular - weight complexes with BAP29 , a homologous membraneprotein 31 thatalsoappearedasahitinourscreen ( Fig . 3c ) . BAP31 binds to translocon - associated components ( SEC61 β , TRAM1 ) and interacts with newly synthesized membrane proteins as a quality control factor during folding and assembly 31 – 33 .

On silencing the expression of p97 cofactors UFD1 and NPL4 , an increased ERAD rate has been observed for two single - span membrane proteins with charged residues , CD3 δ and TCR α ( ref . 45 ) . Collectively , the results supported the hypothesis that SV40 uses an ERAD pathway reserved for the degradation of misfolded membrane proteins that expose charged residues to the hydrophobic environment of the ER membrane . To validate BAP31 as a hit , we carried out rescue experiments using siRNAs that targeted the untranslated region ( UTR ) of the BAP31 transcript . These efficiently silenced BAP31 expression in HeLa cells , and completely blocked infection ( Fig . 4a ) . For rescue , HeLa cells were first transfected with UTR siRNAs , and after 72h with a plasmid encoding BAP31 – Flag devoid of the UTR sequences . Cells were infected with SV40 , collected after a further 24h , immunostained for BAP31 – Flag and viral T - antigen ( T - ag ) and analysed by fluorescence - activated cell sorting ( FACS ) . When BAP31 silencing was followed by EGFP expression , no infection was observed ( Fig . 4b ) . However , followed by the expression of BAP31 – Flag , susceptibility to infection was rescued to a level of 35 % ( white bars ) . The incomplete rescue was probably explained by overexpression of BAP31 – Flag causing a general decrease in infection ( Fig . 4c ) . Consistent with this , in CV - 1 cells where the level of ectopically expressed BAP31 was lower ( data not shown ) , the rescue of infection reached an efficiency of 90 % ( Fig . 4d ) . Taken together , SV40 infection was blocked by a knockdown of BAP31 , and could be rescued by ectopic BAP31 – Flag expression . BAP31 is required after initial uncoating To assess whether the effect of BAP31 depletion involved transport of SV40 to the ER or subsequent events , we used an assay in which the ERp57 - catalysed isomerization of disulphide bonds between viral VP1 NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 13 | NUMBER 11 | NOVEMBER 2011 1309 © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited .

( a ) CV - 1 cells were ﬁxed , stained with BAP31 and calnexin antibodies and analysed by confocal immunoﬂuorescence microscopy . ( b ) Calnexin and BAP31 are located in different microdomains in the ER . Shown is a higher - magniﬁcation image of the area outlined in a . The inset shows an area ( outlined ) where four tubules containing calnexin merge . The branch point is devoid of calnexin but contains BAP31 .

Bars represent the mean ± s . e . m . , n = 3 ( ≥ 100 cells were analysed per experiment ) . proteins is monitored 6 . After exposure to ERp57 in the ER , a fraction of VP1 is disconnected from a disulphide - bonded network , and can be detected as monomers . Cells transfected with siRNA against BAP31 ( or control siRNA ) were exposed to SV40 for 2 or 8h , and then alkylated , lysed and subjected to non - reducing SDS – PAGE . Immunoblotting showed that after 2h , VP1 still migrated exclusively as oligomers . However , after 8h , a fraction migrated as monomers both in control siRNA - treated and BAP31 - depleted cells ( Fig . 4e ) . BAP31 was thus required in a step after transport of the virus to the ER lumen , and after isomerization of disulphide bonds . SV40 induces redistribution of BAP31 in the ER When CV - 1 cells were analysed by immunofluorescence microscopy , calnexin , a membrane - bound ER marker ( Fig . 5a ) , and BAP31 were both present in the reticular ER but often in distinct subdomains ( Fig . 5b ) . BAP31 was , in fact , mostly present in small , calnexin - free foci . After exposure of CV - 1 cells to high titres of SV40 , the BAP31 staining changed to larger foci ( Fig . 5c ) . Fluorescent SV40 , at lower titres , localized in the BAP31 - containing foci ( Fig . 5d ) , which also contained BAP29 ( Fig . 5e ) but not calnexin ( Fig . 5f ) . To determine whether VP2 and 3 mediated clustering of BAP31 around SV40 , CV - 1 cells were inoculated with VLPs devoid of VP2 and 3 and with empty SV40 particles consisting of VP1 – 3 but lacking the genome . In contrast to empty SV40 particles , VLPs did not induce BAP31 - containing foci ( Fig . 5g ) , indicating that VP2 and 3 , but not the genome , were required to recruit BAP31 . These results are consistent with a role for VP2 in BAP31 association . The cytosolic domain of BAP31 is dispensable for SV40 infection The cytosolic domain of BAP31 is involved in apoptosis and contains two caspase 8L cleavage sites 46 , 47 ( Fig . 6a ) . To determine whether the cytosolic domain was important for SV40 infection , we investigated the capacity of BAP31 mutants to rescue SV40 infection . Mutants lacking either of the caspase 8L cleavage sites , D164A and D238A , efficiently supported infection ( Fig . 6b ) . Similar results were obtained for the BAP31 mutant p20 lacking the entire cytosolic domain . In addition , a pan caspase inhibitor ( Z - FAD ( fmk ) ) did not block infection ( Supplementary Fig . S4a ) . This indicated that the transmembrane domain of BAP31 alone could support SV40 infection , and that the role of BAP31 in apoptosis was dispensable . 1310 NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 13 | NUMBER 11 | NOVEMBER 2011 © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited .

After 72h , cells were lysed and 20 µ g cell lysate was analysed by SDS – PAGE and western blot analysis using antibodies against BAP31 and tubulin . Uncropped images of blots are shown in Supplementary Fig . S7 . Infection requires charged residues in the transmembrane domain of BAP31 The transmembrane domain of BAP31 contains three charged residues , Glu 15 , Arg 117 and Arg 118 . We mutated these residues to alanines . After confirming that the mutations did not change the intracellular localization of BAP31 ( Supplementary Fig . S4b ) , we investigated whether they had an effect on SV40 infection . The double mutant R117A / R118A reduced infection by 50 – 60 % when compared with the wild type ( Fig . 6c ) . Glu 15 of BAP31 was not required for infection by wild - type SV40 ; the E15A mutant supported infection even better than wild - type BAP31 ( Fig . 6c ) . However , when the VP2 E17K - R mutant viruses were investi - gated , a requirement for Glu 15 of BAP31 was apparent . As shown in Fig . 6d , infectivity of both mutant viruses was rescued by a BAP31 E15A mutanttoalevelof60 – 70 % whencomparedwithwild - typeBAP31 . Taken together , the results indicated that the membrane - embedded arginines in BAP31 were important for SV40 infection . A mutant virus with a positive instead of a negative charge in position 17 , in contrast , depended on a glutamate in the transmembrane domain of BAP31 . We concluded that there was a direct interaction ( possibly through charge - pairing ) between the N terminus of VP2 and the transmembrane domain of BAP31 . mPy also depends on BAP31 The first 30 N - terminal amino acids in mPy VP2 are almost identical to those of SV40 ( Supplementary Fig . S1b ) . To investigate the role of BAP31 in mPy infection , we depleted mouse 3T6 cells of BAP31 using siRNA ( Fig . 6f ) . Figure 6e shows that this blocked mPy infection . Transfection of BAP31 – Flag rescued infection , indicating that the phenotype was specific for BAP31 . A role for BiP in SV40 infection Of the lumenal chaperones , only BiP ( also known as HSPA5 , heat shock protein 5 ) was a strong hit in the siRNA screen . BiP is involved in ERAD of various substrates 39 , 48 , 49 . GRP94 was a weak hit , and calnexin depletion had no effect on infection ( Fig . 7a – d ) . VP1 contains three potential BiP binding sequences 50 , one of which is partially exposed in the pentamer ( Supplementary Fig . S5a , b ) . We found that the virus - induced foci in the ER contained BiP ( Fig . 7e ) but not ERp57 ( Fig . 7f ) . After silencing of BiP expression , SV40 still trafficked to the ER and induced BAP31 - containing foci ( Fig . 7g ) . Consistent with this , silencing of BiP expression did not prevent isomerization of interpentameric VP1 disulphide bonds ( Fig . 7h ) . This indicated that SV40 first experiences a conformational change and associates with BAP31 before BiP becomes involved in infection . BAP31 and BiP are required for dislocation of SV40 from the ER to the cytosol Using the above - described SNAP assay , we found that SV40 trafficked to the ER when BAP31 and BiP expression was silenced ( Fig . 8a ) , but failed to escape into the cytosol ( Fig . 8b ) .

Bottom , HeLa cells ( a , c , d ) or CV1 cells ( b ) were transfected with the indicated siRNAs as described above and lysed after 72h . Cell lysate ( 20 µ g ) was analysed by SDS – PAGE and western blot analysis using antibodies against the target protein and a control protein ( tubulin or actin ) . ( c ) GRP94 is a weak hit because GRP94 _ 5 siRNA decreases protein expression but barely affects infection . Geldanamycin , an inhibitor of GRP94 , decreases infection indices by 25 % to a level of 0 . 75 ( ref . 6 ) . ( e , f ) Cells were infected with 488 – SV40 for 18h , ﬁxed and stained with antibodies against BAP31 , and against BiP or ERp57 . Scale bars , 10 µ m . ( g ) CV - 1 cells were treated for 72h with 20nM control siRNA or siRNA against BiP . Then , cells were infected with SV40 ( MOI = 50 ) and analysed as in Fig . 5g . Bars represent the mean ± s . e . m . , n = 3 ( ≥ 100 cells were analysed per experiment ) . ( h ) CV - 1 cells were treated for 72h with 20nM control siRNA or siRNA against BiP . Then cells were infected with puriﬁed SV40 for 2h or 8h , lysed , separated by non - reducing SDS – PAGE and analysed by western blot analysis using VP1 and VP3 antibodies . Samples were also analysed by reducing SDS – PAGE and western blot analysis using tubulin and BiP antibodies . Uncropped images of blots are shown in Supplementary Fig . S7 . by a digitonin - semipermeabilization assay 51 . When cells were treated with 40 µ gml − 1 digitonin followed by centrifugation , the supernatant contained the cytosolic marker protein Hsp70 but not the highly abundant soluble ER proteins GRP94 and ERp57 ( Fig . 8c , red rectangle ) . Thus , the plasma membrane was permeabilized but the ER membrane remained intact . When cells were exposed to SV40 for 8h and treated with digitonin , a small amount of VP1 was detected in the supernatant ( Fig . 8d ) . This was largely inhibited by BFA , which inhibits the endocytosis of SV40 ( ref . 52 ) , and by MG132 , a proteasome inhibitor . As shown in Fig . 8e , silencing of either BAP31 or BiP expression also blocked ER - to - cytosol transport of SV40 ; only background levels of VP1 were detected in the supernatant . Next , we quantified the viral DNA in the cytosolic fractions using rtPCR . Six hours after exposure of cells to SV40 , the amount of viral DNA in the cytosolic fraction increased 160 - fold relative to negative controls , and after 8h 550 - fold ( Fig . 8f ) . Dislocation of SV40 DNA to the cytosol was largely inhibited by BFA and MG132 ( Fig . 8f ) as well as by silencing of BAP31 or BiP expression ( Fig . 8g ) . These results indicated that the viral genome , most likely in association with viral proteins , escapes from the ER to the cytosol , and that this process is assisted by BAP31 and BiP . When CV - 1 cells were treated with MG132 , SV40 trafficked to the ER ( Fig . 2g ) , but failed to traverse the ER membrane into the cytosol ( Fig . 8d ) . Instead of co - localizing with SV40 ( Fig . 8f ) , BAP31 was almost entirely sequestered into multiple foci containing ubiquitin , proteasomes , calnexin , Derlin - 1 and BiP ( Supplementary Fig . S6 ) . The most likely explanation was that MG132 stalls dislocation of misfolded proteins 33 , 53 , which interferes with SV40 infection . DISCUSSION Our results support a six - step model ( Fig . 8i ) . Lumenal factors including ERp57 first induce a conformational change in the capsid ( Step 1 ) . The hydrophobic and myristylated N - terminal sequences of VP2 are exposed 54 ( Step 2 ) and insert into the ER membrane ( Step 3 ) . The glutamic acids in position 17 serve as ‘bait’ interacting with positive charges in the third transmembrane spans of BAP31 ( Step 4 ) and its homologue BAP29 ( ref . 55 ) . In Step 5 , we propose multiple BAP31 and BAP29 molecules clustering around SV40 , forming a platform 1312 NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 13 | NUMBER 11 | NOVEMBER 2011 © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited .

Uncropped images of blots are shown in Supplementary Fig . S8 . through which viruses escape into the cytosol ( Step 6 ) . The role of BiP may be to prevent virus aggregation , a prerequisite for ERAD ( ref . 49 ) . The particles that escape into the cytosol contain the genome , at least some of the VP1 pentamers , and VP2 and 3 , which contain a nuclear localization signal at their C termini crucial for infection 16 . The related mPy probably uses a similar mechanism . It undergoes a conformationalchangeintheER ( refs25 , 56 ) , requiresDerlin - 2 ( ref . 57 ) for infection , and , as shown here , depends on BAP31 . Thus , SV40 , mPy and possibly other members of the polyomaviruses have evolved to exploit ERAD for penetration , the only machinery in mammalian cells known to support the transport of integral membrane proteins from ER lumen and membrane into the cytosol . How the ERAD machinery manages to handle a substrate as big as the virus remains an intriguing question that may be answered by more detailed analysis of BAP31 , BAP29 and ERAD .
