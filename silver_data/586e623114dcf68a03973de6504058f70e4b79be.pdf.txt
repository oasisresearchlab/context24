Volume 23 December 15 , 2012 4833 MBoC | ARTICLE Calcineurin - dependent cofilin activation and increased retrograde actin flow drive 5 - HT – dependent neurite outgrowth in Aplysia bag cell neurons Xiao - Feng Zhang , Callen Hyland , David Van Goor , and Paul Forscher Department of Molecular , Cellular , and Developmental Biology , Yale University , New Haven , CT 06520 ABSTRACT Neurite outgrowth in response to soluble growth factors often involves changes in intracellular Ca 2 + ; however , mechanistic roles for Ca 2 + in controlling the underlying dy - namic cytoskeletal processes have remained enigmatic . Bag cell neurons exposed to sero - tonin ( 5 - hydroxytryptamine [ 5 - HT ] ) respond with a threefold increase in neurite outgrowth rates . Outgrowth depends on phospholipase C ( PLC ) → inositol trisphosphate → Ca 2 + → calcineurin signaling and is accompanied by increased rates of retrograde actin network flow in the growth cone P domain . Calcineurin inhibitors had no effect on Ca 2 + release or basal levels of retrograde actin flow ; however , they completely suppressed 5 - HT – dependent out - growth and F - actin flow acceleration . 5 - HT treatments were accompanied by calcineurin - dependent increases in cofilin activity in the growth cone P domain . 5 - HT effects were mim - icked by direct activation of PLC , suggesting that increased actin network treadmilling may be a widespread mechanism for promoting neurite outgrowth in response to neurotrophic factors . INTRODUCTION Soluble neurotropic factors play an important role in development ( Kennedy et al . , 1994 ; Ming et al . , 1997 ; Campbell and Holt , 2001 ; Briancon - Marjollet et al . , 2008 ) . However , basic cytoskeletal mecha - nisms by which soluble factors affect rates of neuronal outgrowth remain poorly understood . Serotonin ( 5 - hydroxytryptamine [ 5 - HT ] ) is a soluble ligand that can signal through G ( q ) - coupled receptors in Aplysia neurons ( Li et al . , 1995 , 2005 ; Cai et al . , 2008 ) and trigger phospholipase C ( PLC ) – and inositol trisphosphate ( IP 3 ) – dependent Ca 2 + release from intracellular endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) stores in bag cell neuron growth cones ( Zhang and Forscher , 2009 ) . The efficacy and spatial characteristics of Ca 2 + release can be modulated by activity of the small GTPase Rac1 . Rac1 activity promotes micro - tubule assembly and microtubule - dependent ER Ca 2 + store trans - port into peripheral regions of the growth cone . Rac1 activity also promotes reactive oxygen species production , which sensitizes IP 3 - dependent Ca 2 + release ( Gordeeva et al . , 2003 ; Zhang and Forscher , 2009 ) . Here we investigate how release of Ca 2 + from intracellular stores affects actin filament dynamics involved in neurite outgrowth . We show that 5 - HT application results in increased rates of neurite out - growth , accompanied by increased rates of retrograde F - actin net - work flow . 5 - HT – evoked growth involves Ca 2 + release from IP 3 - gated stores and calcineurin ( protein phosphatase 2B ) - dependent activation of the actin - recycling protein cofilin . Of interest , the re - sulting increases in actin network flow were independent of myosin II activity , whereas increases in neurite outgrowth were myosin II dependent .

Received : Oct 4 , 2012 Accepted : Oct 15 , 2012 4834 | X . - F . Zhang et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell that culturing neurons on laminin substrates might increase basal Rac activity to a level at which 5 - HT would elicit Ca 2 + release without the use of constitutively active Rac con - structs ( Zhang and Forscher , 2009 ) . Bag cell neurons were cultured on lami - nin substrates and neurite outgrowth as - sessed by differential interference contrast ( DIC ) time - lapse imaging for 2 h before and 6 h after 5 - HT ( 10 μM ) or vehicle addition ( Figure 1A ) . Under these conditions , 5 - HT treatment resulted in approximately three - fold increase in average neurite outgrowth rate ( Figure 1A ) . Because neurite outgrowth rates were more or less constant for up to 6 h in 5 - HT , we chose to analyze population responses before and after 1 h of 5 - HT ex - posure ( Figure 1 , B and C ) when a ∼ 3 . 5 - fold increase in neurite outgrowth rate was typi - cally observed ( Figure 1C ) . Both basal and 5 - HT – dependent out - growth rates were strongly attenuated by RGD peptide , which competitively inhibits laminin – integrin interactions ( Gruenbaum and Carew , 1999 ; Tucker et al . , 2005 ) . In contrast , the reverse sequence DGR pep - tide control had no effect . These results con - firm the specificity of the permissive role laminin plays in supporting both basal ( Turney and Bridgman , 2005 ) and 5 - HT – evoked ( Figure 1C ) neurite outgrowth . To test whether growth on laminin depended on Rac GTPase activity , we used a Rac1 - specific small - molecule inhibitor , NSC23766 ( Gao et al . , 2004 ) . NSC23766 inhibited both basal and 5 - HT – stimulated growth , consis - tent with the reported role of Rac activity in integrin function ( Figure 1C ; Kuhn et al . , 1998 ; Grabham et al . , 2003 ; Matsuo et al . , 2003 ; Laforest et al . , 2005 ) . 5 - HT increases peripheral retrograde F - actin flow rate Next we investigated actin filament dynam - ics before and during 5 - HT – evoked growth responses . Neurons were injected with ei - ther Alexa 568 – G - actin or Alexa 594 – phal - loidin at trace levels to generate F - actin speckles for kinetic analysis . Features of Al - exa 594 – phalloidin bound to F - actin or Al - exa 568 – G - actin speckles incorporated into F - actin were tracked over time using a previ - ously reported quantitative cross - correlation approach ( Ji and Danuser , 2005 ; Burnette et al . , 2007 ; Hu et al . , 2007 ) . Resulting retro - grade actin flow velocities were pseudocolor coded and corresponding vectors overlaid on images to illustrate actin translocation . Figure 2A is a representative example of Al - exa 568 – G - actin fluorescent speckle microscopy ( FSM ) data ( top ) and corresponding flow maps ( bottom ) from a growth cone before and after 5 - HT treatment . 5 - HT exposure elicited 6 . 6 ± 1 . 0 % and advance ( Kuhn et al . , 1998 ; Grabham et al . , 2003 ; Matsuo et al . , 2003 ; Laforest et al . , 2005 ) . On the basis of our previous finding that Ca 2 + release from IP 3 stores was Rac dependent , we hypothesized FIGURE 1 : 5 - HT induces neurite outgrowth on laminin substrates .

Molecular Biology of the Cell Taken together , these results indicate that 5 - HT treatment triggers a persistent increase in peripheral F - actin flow that is well corre - lated with the observed accelerated rate of growth cone advance . Direct phospholipase C activation increases neurite growth and retrograde flow rates To investigate the generality of this re - sponse , we bypassed the 5 - HT receptor and directly activated PLC—the downstream ef - fector of receptor signaling through trimeric Gq proteins ( Figure 3 ) . PLC activation with m - 3M3FBS ( 25 μM ; Bae et al . , 2003 ; Li et al . , 2009 ) resulted in sustained ∼ 3 . 5 - fold in - creases in neurite outgrowth rates ( Figure 3 , A and B ) accompanied by increases in retro - grade actin flow ( Figure 3 , C and D ) essen - tially identical to those observed after 5 - HT treatments ( Figure 2 ) . 5 - HT – induced F - actin flow increases and outgrowth depend on Ca 2 + release from IP 3 - gated stores Ca 2 + is known to participate in 5 - HT function in neurons ( Dropic et al . , 2005 ; Li et al . , 2005 ; Cai et al . , 2008 ) . Previously we re - ported that 5 - HT evoked Ca 2 + release in Ap - lysia growth cones in the presence of consti - tutively active ( but not dominant negative ) Rac1 when cells were plated on PLL sub - strates ( Zhang and Forscher , 2009 ) . Given that laminin has been widely reported to increase Rac activity ( Kuhn et al . , 1998 ; Grabham et al . , 2003 ; Matsuo et al . , 2003 ; Laforest et al . , 2005 ) and the robust Rac de - pendence of the outgrowth responses un - der study ( Figure 1C ) , we tested whether 5 - HT would elicit Ca 2 + release in growth cones on laminin substrates . Supplemental Figure 1A shows that 5 - HT treatments in - deed evoked rapid and sustained Ca 2 + in - creases in the entire growth cone ( see also Supplemental Movie S2 ) . These responses depended on the PLC → IP 3 signaling cas - cade since the PLC inhibitor U73122 ( Jin et al . , 1994 ; Zhou et al . , 1999 ) or the IP 3 re - ceptor blocker xestospongin C ( XeC ; Gafni et al . , 1997 ) abolished 5 - HT – evoked Ca 2 + responses ( Supplemental Figure S1 , A and B ) . During more prolonged 5 - HT exposure ( 1 h ) , Ca 2 + levels remained elevated ∼ 22 % above baseline . These Ca 2 + changes were also inhibited by pretreatment with PLC or IP 3 receptor antagonists ( Supplemental Fig - ure 1 , C and D , and Supplemental Movie S3 ) . Finally , pretreatment with the Rac inhibitor NSC23766 abol - ished 5 - HT – dependent Ca 2 + responses ( Supplemental Figure S2 ) . Collectively , these data show that 5 - HT triggers sustained Ca 2 + in - creases in parallel with increased retrograde F - actin flow when Rac levels are sufficiently elevated . flow maps before and after 30 min in 5 - HT . Rates of growth cone advance were correlated with increased F - actin flow rates ( Figure 2C , DIC vs . flow map ; see Supplemental Movie S1 ) . On average , F - actin flow rates significantly increased by 27 . 2 ± 2 . 1 % and 29 . 3 ± 2 . 5 % after 30 - and 60 - min 5 - HT exposures , respectively ( Figure 2D ) .

Figure 4A shows Ca 2 + levels and FSM records from a growth cone before and after a 30 - min 5 - HT treatment . Ca 2 + levels and peripheral F - actin flow rates increased in parallel by 20 . 9 and 25 . 4 % , respectively . There was a strong temporal correlation between aver - age 5 - HT – evoked Ca 2 + elevations and in - creases in F - actin flow ( Figure 4B ) . When Ca 2 + release from intracellular stores was blocked by inhibiting PLC or IP 3 using U73122 or XeC , respectively , no changes in baseline actin flow or growth rates were ob - served ; however , 5 - HT – evoked increases in F - actin flow and concomitant increases in neurite outgrowth were completely sup - pressed ( Figure 4 , C and D ) . Taken together , these results indicate that IP 3 - dependent Ca 2 + mobilization is upstream of , and neces - sary for , the increased F - actin flow rates and growth - promoting effects of 5 - HT observed . 5 - HT effect on F - actin flow is independent of myosin light - chain kinase activity Given that 5 - HT - induced increases in F - actin flow were Ca 2 + dependent and myosin II activity is known to affect F - actin flow rates ( Lin et al . , 1996 ; Medeiros et al . , 2006 ) , we investigated whether activation of myosin light - chain kinase ( MLCK ) , which is a Ca 2 + / calmodulin – dependent regulator of myosin II activity ( Kamm and Stull , 2001 ; Schmidt et al . , 2002 ) , could be the Ca 2 + effector mediat - ing flow increases . We used ML - 7 , a well - characterized MLCK inhibitor ( Ruchhoeft and Harris , 1997 ; Zhou and Cohan , 2001 ; Zhang et al . , 2003 ) effective in our system ( Zhang et al . , 2003 ) . In control experi - ments , we found that exposure to ML - 7 alone ( 15 – 20 min ) did not alter Ca 2 + lev - els ( Supplemental Figure S3A ; also see Figure 5B , inset vs . left ) ; however , F - actin flow rates decreased by ∼ 15 % ( Supple - mental Figure S3B ; also see Figure 5D , inset vs . left ) consistent with previous re - ports that MLCK activity is involved in set - ting basal F - actin flow rates ( Zhang et al . , 2003 ) . We next investigated the effect of MLCK inhibition on 5 - HT – evoked Ca 2 + release and F - actin flow . After MLCK inhi - bition , 5 - HT continued to evoke Ca 2 + release ( + 17 % ; Figure 5B ) , as well as in - creases in peripheral F - actin flow ( + 29 % ; Figure 5 , C and D ) . Indeed , statistical analysis indicated that MLCK inhibition did not significantly affect the depth of 5 - HT – evoked Ca 2 + re - sponses ( Table 1 ) or increases in F - actin flow ( Table 2 ) . In sum - mary , although MLCK plays a role in setting basal F - actin flow To directly address the relationship between Ca 2 + levels and F - actin dynamics , we performed simultaneous ratiometric Ca 2 + im - aging and F - actin FSM ( see Supplemental Movie S4 , A and B , for FIGURE 4 : 5 - HT - evoked Ca 2 + release and peripheral retrograde actin flow increases are correlated and necessary for induced neurite outgrowth .

Zhang et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 5 - HT effects on F - actin flow are independent of myosin II activity Previous evidence suggested that myosin II sets the maximum rate of retrograde F - actin flow in growth cones ( Lin et al . , 1996 ; Medeiros et al . , 2006 ; Burnette et al . , 2007 ) . To directly investigate the role myosin II plays in 5 - HT effects , we used blebbistatin , a specific nonmuscle myosin II ATPase inhibitor ( Straight et al . , 2003 ; Allingham et al . , 2005 ) that has been extensively char - acterized in our system ( Medeiros et al . , 2006 ) . Similar to what was previously ob - served for growth cones plated on PLL sub - strates , 10 - to 20 - min blebbistatin exposures promoted elongation of filopodial actin bundles , resulting in rearward expansion of the peripheral cytoplasmic domain ( Supple - mental Figure S4A and Supplemental Movie S5 ) . During blebbistatin treatment periph - eral F - actin flow rates typically decreased by ∼ 20 % ( Supplemental Figure 4 , A bottom , and B ) , consistent with nonmuscle myosin II playing a role in setting basal rates of retro - grade F - actin flow on laminin as previously observed on PLL substrates ( Medeiros et al . , 2006 ) . We then investigated a role for myosin II in 5 - HT – induced increases in F - actin flow . Neurons were pretreated with blebbistatin for 20 min to maximally inhibit myosin II activity ( Medeiros et al . , 2006 ) and then challenged with 5 - HT . Remarkably , after blebbistatin pretreatment , 5 - HT exposure continued to trigger increases in retrograde flow ( ∼ 25 . 5 % increase after 10 min ; Figure 6A ) at levels similar to that observed under control conditions ( Figure 6B ) that were sus - tained for up to 60 min ( Figure 6C ; kymo - graphs show flow increases of 22 . 0 and 25 . 1 % at 30 - and 60 - min time points , re - spectively ) . The average magnitude of 5 - HT – induced actin flow increases was not significantly different between control and blebbistatin - pretreated growth cones ( Figure 6D ) . These results strongly suggest that changes in myosin II activity are not in - volved in the 5 - HT – induced increases in ac - tin network flow and corresponding in - creased rates of actin filament turnover observed . We then investigated whether myosin II activity is necessary for the more global ef - fect of 5 - HT on neurite outgrowth . To be consistent with the aforementioned experiments , outgrowth rates were assessed for 1 h under control conditions and during 5 - HT exposure . We noted that in ∼ 75 % of the growth cones ( n = 90 ) , ∼ 1 . 5 h of exposure to blebbistatin alone resulted in neurite branching accompanied by enhanced rates of neurite outgrowth . Similarly , long - term blebbistatin treatment has been reported to promote neurite outgrowth in chicken retina explants , medulla , and spinal cord neurons ( Rosner et al . , 2007 ) . Given the foregoing rates , 5 - HT effects on actin network flow were essentially inde - pendent of MLCK activity . Of interest , MLCK inhibition did appear to inhibit 5 - HT – evoked neurite outgrowth ( Figure 5A ; dotted red line ) , suggest - ing that 5 - HT effects on actin dynamics versus neurite growth might have differential myosin II dependences . To test this pos - sibility , we further investigated the role of myosin II in 5 - HT – me - diated growth . FIGURE 5 : 5 - HT - induced increase in actin flow is independent of MLCK activity .

Volume 23 December 15 , 2012 Actin treadmilling and neurite growth | 4839 release ( Supplemental Figure S6 and Figure 7 , A and B ) ; however , increases in F - actin flow rate were completely suppressed ( Figure 7 , A and C ) . These results strongly suggest that 5 - HT – induced in - creases in F - actin flow depend on calcineurin activation downstream of Ca 2 + release from intracellular stores . To investigate the role of calcineurin in 5 - HT – evoked neurite out - growth , we assessed growth rates for 1 h in the presence of CN - AIP , FK - 506 , or CsA alone and after 5 - HT exposure . Calcineurin inhibi - tion had no effect on basal neurite outgrowth rates but completely blocked 5 - HT – dependent neurite outgrowth ( Figure 7D ; see also DIC in Supplemental Figure S6 ) . Taken together , these results sup - port a mechanism by which 5 - HT treatment promotes neurite out - growth through a calcineurin - dependent increase in actin network flow and turnover . 5 - HT – dependent calcineurin activation increases apCofilin1 activity Cofilin is highly expressed in neuronal growth cones , and increased cofilin activity has been implicated in neurite extension ( Meberg and Bamburg , 2000 ; Endo et al . , 2003 ; Ng and Luo , 2004 ; Tahirovic and Bradke , 2009 ) . Cofilin is inhibited by phosphorylation by LIM kinase and activated by the cofilin phosphatase Slingshot ( DesMarais et al . , 2005 ) . It has been reported that intracellular Ca 2 + elevation leads to calcineurin - dependent Slingshot activation and cofilin dephospho - rylation ( Wang et al . , 2005 ) . Therefore we investigated a potential link between calcineurin and cofilin activity in 5 - HT – induced neurite outgrowth . To generate cofilin activity probes , we identified and cloned two Aplysia californica cofilin homologues ( apCofilin1 and apCofilin2 , which share only 25 . 1 % sequence identity ) . Antibodies were generated using recombinant proteins encoding both full - length apCofilins . We successfully generated phospho - specific anti - bodies against apCofilin1 and used this antibody in combination with total anti - apCofilin1 to assess apCofilin1 activity patterns ( see Table 3 and Supplemental Figures S7 and S8 ) . To assess 5 - HT effects on the spatial profile of apCofilin1 activity , we generated ratiometric P - apCofilin1 / Total - apCofilin1 images . 5 - HT treatments significantly increased , that is , disinhibited apCofi - lin1 activity in the entire growth cone , reflected by a decrease in measured P - apCofilin1 / Total - aPcofilin1 levels ( Figure 8 , A and B ) . Pretreatment with the calcineurin inhibitor FK - 506 completely considerations , neurons were pretreated with blebbistatin for 10 min to establish maximal inhibitory effects on actin flow ( Medeiros et al . , 2006 ) and then exposed to 5 - HT for only 1 h in the continued presence of blebbistatin , at which time outgrowth rates were assessed . Blebbistatin treatment completely blocked 5 - HT – evoked neurite outgrowth ( Figure 6E ; see also DIC in C ) , consistent with effects seen after MLCK inhibition ( Figure 6E ) . Taken together , these results suggest that 5 - HT treatment leads to increases in actin network flow that are independent of myosin II activity ; however , myosin contractility appears to be essential to functionally couple increased actin network flow rates to the pro - cess of neurite advance . 5 - HT – induced increase in F - actin flow depends on calcineurin activity Calcineurin , or Ca 2 + / calmodulin – dependent protein phosphatase 2B ( PP2B ) , is enriched in growth cones and has been implicated in Ca 2 + - dependent regulation of neurite extension and filopodium dynamics ( Ferreira et al . , 1993 ; Chang et al . , 1995 ; Lautermilch and Spitzer , 2000 ; Cheng et al . , 2002 ; Arie et al . , 2009 ) . Although cy - toskeletal proteins have often been implicated in calcineurin ac - tions , to our knowledge calcineurin effects on actin dynamics have never been directly assessed . Thus we first looked at potential ef - fects of calcineurin inhibition alone on actin dynamics . To this end , we treated cells with the cell - permeable calcineurin inhibitor FK - 506 or cyclosporin A ( CsA ; Liu et al . , 1991 ; Fruman et al . , 1992 ) . The Ca 2 + levels and F - actin flow rates did not differ significantly from controls after 20 – 40 min of FK - 506 or CsA exposure alone ( Supplemental Figure S5 , A and B ) . As an alternative approach , we injected a spe - cific calcineurin inhibitor consisting of the conserved calcineurin au - toinhibitory peptide domain ( CN - AIP ; Hashimoto et al . , 1990 ; Perrino et al . , 1995 ) into cells . CN - AIP injection also had no effect on F - actin flow rates ( unpublished data ) . These observations indicate that basal levels of retrograde actin flow do not depend on calcineu - rin activity . We next investigated effects of calcineurin inhibition on 5 - HT – evoked Ca 2 + release .

Molecular Biology of the Cell Volume 23 December 15 , 2012 Actin treadmilling and neurite growth | 4841 The cytoskeletal mechanism of this 5 - HT growth response con - trasts with what was observed during acute transitions from nonper - missive to permissive extracellular growth substrates ( Lin and Forscher , 1995 ) or after application of apCAM - coated beads , for which increased rates of advance were correlated with decreased retrograde actin flow rates ( Suter and Forscher , 2000 , 2001 ) . The rate of retrograde flow ( V r ) in the P domain is determined by the balance of forces on actin networks ( Craig et al . , 2012 ) . Actin net - work assembly near the leading edge and nonmuscle myosin II con - tractility in the T zone generate pushing and pulling forces , f poly and f motor , respectively , which drive network flow ( Figure 9B , red arrows ; Lin et al . , 1996 ; Henson et al . , 1999 ; Mogilner and Oster , 2003 ; Medeiros et al . , 2006 ) . Constant actin polymer turnover is necessary to prevent buildup of compressive forces in the T zone ( Figure 9B ; f break ) , which resist actin filament flow ( Van Goor et al . , 2012 ) . In ad - dition to these internal forces , adhesion to extracellular substrates can generate traction forces ( Figure 9B ; f adhesion ) , which tend to op - pose retrograde flow ( Lin and Forscher , 1995 ) and are the basis of the “molecular clutch hypothesis” for regulation of neurite growth ( Mitchison and Kirschner , 1988 ; Suter and Forscher , 1998 ; Suter and Forscher , 2001 ; Schaefer et al . , 2008 ) . Adhesion and network com - pression can be modeled as viscous drags ( ε adhesion and ε break , re - spectively ) , which result in forces that scale with actin flow velocity . In summary , actin polymerization and myosin II contractility tend to increase retrograde flow rates , whereas network compression in the T zone and / or adhesion to extracelluar substrates tend to decrease it ( Figure 9C ; see Craig et al . , 2012 ) . We found that 5 - HT treatments ( or PLC activation ) resulted in acceleration of V r without a significant change in P domain width . This means that increases in actin assembly had to be matched by increases in filament turnover . In line with this finding , recent related studies from our group support a key role for actin filament turnover in determining retrograde flow rates and P domain geometry ( Van Goor et al . , 2012 ; Yang et al . , 2012 ) . The importance of F - actin turn - over for axon extension has also been reported ( Bradke and Dotti , 1999 ; Gallo et al . , 2002 ) . Cofilin activation promotes actin filament turnover , thereby re - ducing network density and decreasing ε break , which would sup - port the faster F - actin flow rates observed . Moreover , actin filament disassembly tends to increase G - actin concentration . Together these processes would increase polymerization rates and facilitate the accelerated actin treadmilling rates observed . In addition , abolished 5 - HT – dependent cofilin activation , resulting in activity patterns very similar to those of controls ( Figure 8 , A , right , and C ) . Population analysis demonstrated that 5 - HT treatment markedly in - creased cofilin activity in the distal one - third and the proximal one - third of the P domain by ∼ 15 and ∼ 22 % , respectively , compared with controls ( Figure 8D ) . However , in FK - 506 backgrounds , 5 - HT treat - ment did not cause any significant changes in cofilin activity ( Figure 8D ) . Treatment with in FK - 506 alone did not significantly change apCoflin1 activity . Taken together , these observations suggest that 5 - HT triggers calcineurin - dependent apCofilin1 activation , which supports increased rates of growth cone and neurite advance . DISCUSSION In Aplysia neurons , 5 - HT induces actin polymerization essential for synaptic remodeling associated with long - term facilitation ( Hatada et al . , 2000 ; Udo et al . , 2005 ) . Facilitation also depends on Ca 2 + re - lease from postsynaptic stores ( Li et al . , 2005 ; Cai et al . , 2008 ) . These findings suggest roles for Ca 2 + release and actin dynamics in synap - tic plasticity ; however , mechanisms by which these processes con - tribute to 5 - HT – dependent neurite outgrowth are not well under - stood . Here we describe a novel mechanism of neurite growth by which exposure to a soluble factor , 5 - HT , triggers Ca 2 + release from intracellular stores , which in turn promotes increased rates of retro - grade actin network flow accompanied by calcineurin - dependent apCofilin activation ( Figure 9A ) . Calcineurin , or PP2B , is a Ca 2 + / calmodulin - dependent serine – threonine phosphatase , which plays a role in coupling Ca 2 + signals to many neuronal responses ( Groth et al . , 2003 ; Nguyen and Di Giovanni , 2008 ; Bodmer et al . , 2011 ) and has been implicated in promoting neurite outgrowth ( Ferreira et al . , 1993 ; Chang et al . , 1995 ; Sotogaku et al . , 2007 ; Arie et al . , 2009 ; Figge et al . , 2011 ) . We found that 5 - HT continued to evoke Ca 2 + release after cal - cineurin inhibition ; however , accompanying increases in F - actin flow and neurite outgrowth were completely absent ( Figure 7 ) . Our results indicated that calcineurin activation was necessary for the observed changes in actin dynamics and raised the question of the calcineurin effector . Calcineurin - dependent activation of Slingshot phosphatase can activate cofilin ( Wang et al . , 2005 ; Pandey et al . , 2007 ; Zhao et al . , 2008 ) . In agreement , we found that 5 - HT treatments resulted in calcineurin - dependent activation of apCofilin1 in regions in which increased F - actin flow were ob - served ( Figure 8 ) .

In line with these findings , we recently reported a high density of free barbed ends in a band along the leading edge of bag cell neuron growth cones that were sensitive to treatments that inhibit cofilin activity ( Van Goor et al . , 2012 ) . How can these observations be reconciled with the original mo - lecular clutch hypothesis , which predicts that accelerated neurite outgrowth is correlated with decreased rates of retrograde actin flow ? As per the foregoing discussion , retrograde flow rates depend on four parameters : 1 ) actin filament assembly , 2 ) myosin II contrac - tility , 3 ) actin filament severing / recycling , and 4 ) cell adhesion ( Figure 9 , B and C ) . Assembly and turnover facilitate retrograde flow , whereas network compression and adhesion tend to oppose it . The present results suggest that a revision of the original mole cular clutch hypothesis is in order . In particular , a less constrained multi - level slip clutch model as suggested by Giannone et al . ( 2009 ) can explain the results we observed . Indeed , with a viscous slip clutch – type model , faster flow rates alone without a change in adhesion strength ( ε adhesion ) would result in increased traction force due to increased viscous drag ( Figure 9C ) . Alternatively , ε adhesion could in - crease , but the resulting increase in drag force ( f adhesion ) would have to be matched by increased polymerization and / or motor force to account for the flow rate acceleration observed . It is also possible that flow rates are increasing in 5 - HT as a result of decreased ε adhesion . It will be of interest to measure traction forces in parallel with actin dynamics to address these outstanding issues . It should be noted that the present results are not without precedent : im - mune system dendritic cells have been shown to migrate under con - ditions of extremely low adhesion by increasing their retrograde actin flow rates ( Renkawitz et al . , 2009 ) . Myosin II activity can also promote actin turnover in growth cones ( Medeiros et al . , 2006 ) and nonneuronal cells ( Guha et al . , 2005 ; Murthy and Wadsworth , 2005 ; Haviv et al . , 2008 ) . Here we investi - gated potential roles for myosin light - chain kinase and myosin II ac - tivity in 5 - HT growth responses . Of interest , 5 - HT – dependent in - creases in network turnover and retrograde flow persisted even after MLCK inhibition or direct inhibition of myosin II ( Figures 5 and 6 , A – D , and Table 2 ) . In contrast , neurite outgrowth depended on myosin II activity ( Figures 5 , 6E , and 9 ) , as previously observed in vertebrate neurons ( Bridgman et al . , 2001 ; Turney and Bridgman , 2005 ) . Myosin II activity might regulate adhesion site dynamics and maturation ( Papusheva and Heisenberg , 2010 ) involved in generat - ing traction forces that promote neurite extension ( Zheng et al . , 1991 ; Heidemann and Buxbaum , 1994 ; Heidemann et al . , 1995 ) . Although our results are consistent with myosin II inhibition reducing point contact consolidation ( Woo and Gomez , 2006 ) , further studies involving measurement of growth cone traction force are necessary to address this outstanding issue .

Reagent or vehicle solution injections were typically ∼ 10 % of cell volume . After microinjection , cells were incubated in Na - ASW 1 h before imaging . Confocal microscopy Images were acquired using an Andor Revo - lution XD spinning disk confocal system ( Andor , Belfast , United Kingdom ) with a CSU - X1 confocal head ( Yokogawa , Tokyo , Japan ) and mounted on a Nikon TE 2000E inverted microscope with Perfect Focus ( Nikon , Melville , NY ) . Confocal images were acquired using an Andor iXon EM + 888 elec - tron - multiplying charge - coupled device ( CCD ) camera . Transillumination was pro - vided by a halogen lamp and controlled by a SmartShutter ( Sutter Instrument , Novato , CA ) . Confocal excitation was provided by an Andor Laser Combiner with three laser lines at 488 , 561 , and 647 nm . Emission wavelength was controlled using a Sutter LB10W - 2800 filter wheel outfitted with bandpass filters from Chroma Technology ( Bellows Falls , VT ) . Image acquisition and all other peripherals were controlled by iQ soft - ware ( Andor ) . A Nikon CFI Plan Apo 100 × / 1 . 4 numerical aperture ( NA ) objective was used . Ca 2 + imaging and analysis Fluorescence images of growth cones loaded with the Ca 2 + dye CG - 1 and volume tracer were obtained using the described Andor confocal microscope . Paired images with comparable intensities of CG - 1 and Alexa 568 or Alexa 647 were recorded every 10 s using 300 - to 500 - ms integration times for Ca 2 + signal ( 488 - nm laser line ) and 200 - to 300 - ms integration times for the volume signal ( 561 - or 647 - nm laser line ) . The emis - sion fluorescence filters used ( denoted as center wavelength / bandwidth ) were 535 / 40 , 605 / 40 , and 700 / 40 nm , respectively ( Chroma Technology ) . For each paired im - age , Gaussian convolution was used to re - duce noise levels , and a binary mask was also used to eliminate noise amplification outside the cell .

Plasmids were confirmed by the Keck DNA Sequencing Facility ( Yale University , New Haven , CT ) . Antibody generation Bacterially expressed , recombinant apCofilin1 and apCofilin2 were purified and sent to Proteintech Group ( Chicago , IL ) for generation of antibodies . apCofilin1 and apCofilin2 antibodies were generated in a rabbit or a guinea pig host against full - length apCofilin1 and apCofilin2 , respectively , and were used without affinity purification . Generation of phospho - specific anti - apCofilin1 was performed by 21st Century Biochemicals ( Marlboro , MA ) from phosphorylated peptide corresponding to the first 11 amino acids of apCofilin1 ( PP1 ) . The antibody was generated in a sheep host , affinity depleted against the nonphosphorylated peptide ( NP1 ) , and affinity purified with the PP1 peptide . An attempt to generate a phospho - specific anti - apCofilin2 antibody against the first 10 amino acids of apCofi - lin2 was unsuccessful .

Pro - tein samples were resolved by SDS – PAGE , transferred to nitrocellu - lose membranes ( Scheicher & Schuell BioScience , Dassel , Germany ) by semidry transfer ( TransBlot SD ; Bio - Rad , Hercules , CA ) , probed with the indicated primary and secondary antibodies , developed with SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate ( Pierce , Rockford , IL ) , and digitally exposed using the Epi Chemi II Darkroom ( UVP Laboratory Products , Upland , CA ) . For antigen competition as - says , the primary antibody was preincubated with excess antigen for 30 min at 4°C before use ; the control was preincubated with buffer . For alkaline phosphatase treatment , the nitrocellulose membranes were incubated in CIP buffer ( 50 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 9 , 100 mM NaCl , 10 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM dithiothreitol ) at 37°C for 60 min , with or without 25 U / ml calf intestinal phosphatase ( CIP ; New England Bio - Labs ) . The membranes were washed extensively in TBS - T ( 50 mM Tris , pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl , 0 . 1 % Tween - 20 ) and then processed normally . Immunocytochemistry In a flow chamber , cells were incubated in Fix ( 4 % Formalin , 400 mM NaCl , 10 mM KCl , 15 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 8 , 10 mM CaCl 2 , 55 mM MgCl 2 , and 400 mM sucrose ) for 20 – 30 min and 1 % Triton X - 100 in Fix for 30 min before three washes with PBS - T ( 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 , 137 mM NaCl , 2 . 7 mM KCl , 10 mM phosphate , pH 7 . 5 ) . For anti - body labeling , cells were blocked for 30 min in 5 % BSA / PBS - T , incu - bated with primary antibody for 20 – 30 min in 5 % BSA / PBS - T , washed three times in 5 % BSA / PBS - T , and incubated for 30 min to 1 h in secondary antibody diluted in 5 % BSA / PBS - T . For antigen competi - tion assays , the diluted primary antibody was incubated with 100 - to 500 - fold excess antigen for 30 min at 4°C with rotation before use . For actin visualization , Alexa 594 or Alexa 488 – phalloidin was in - cluded in the secondary antibody solution at 0 . 66 μM . Cells were washed three times in PBS - T and mounted in Mowiol media . Cofilin line scan analysis Line scans of ratio images of background - corrected intensity values of phosphorylated cofilin divided by total cofilin were used to montages for data analysis as reported previously ( Zhang and Forscher , 2009 ) . Average pixel intensity values were obtained from the entire area of the growth cones of interest . The Ca 2 + changes over time were expressed as Δ F / F o , where Δ F = F t − F o and F o is the average Ca 2 + level sampled during the 3 - to 5 - min baseline period ( before 5 - HT addition ) . Δ F / F o ( % ) levels of > 10 % are consid - ered significant . Quantification of actin dynamics by fluorescent speckle microscopy Two methods were used to visualize F - actin for FSM : 1 ) fluorescently labeled G - actin incorporated into actin filaments and 2 ) low levels of fluorescent phalloidin , which specifically binds F - actin but not G - actin . Briefly , two - channel images were acquired using 500 - to 900 - ms integration times for actin fluorescent probe and 120 ms for DIC with 5 - or 10 - s intervals as previously described ( Burnette et al . , 2007 ) . Kymography and automated speckle tracking were used to determine rates of F - actin movement . For kymographs , analysis was done as reported ( Zhang et al . , 2003 ) . For automated flow tracking , an adaptive multiframe correlation algorithm was performed , as de - scribed ( Ji and Danuser , 2005 ) . For image presentation only , the contrast of F - actin FSM images was enhanced by processing with an unsharp mask , followed by low - pass spatial filters . Tandem Ca 2 + ratio and F - actin FSM imaging Ratiometric Ca 2 + imaging was used to measure Ca 2 + levels in the growth cone at the same time as F - actin dynamics was assessed using the methods described . Cells were injected with CG - 1 , Alexa 647 – dextran , and Alex Fluor – 594 phalloidin . DIC , Ca 2 + level , vol - ume signal , and F - actin were recorded in tandem with 5 - or 10 - s sampling intervals . CG - 1 , Alex Fluor 594 – phalloidin , and Alexa 647 – dextran were excited simultaneously with 488 - , 561 - , and 647 - nm laser lines and emission monitored using 535 / 40 - , 605 / 40 - , and 700 / 40 - nm filters , respectively ( Chroma Technology ) . The F - actin dynamics was quantitatively compared and contrasted with corresponding Ca 2 + levels in the growth cone . Neurite outgrowth analysis For long - term time - lapse experiments a Zeiss Axiovert 10 micro - scope with phase contrast optics ( 10 × Achrostigmat / NA 0 . 25 ) and a CoolSnapHQ ( Photometrics , Tucson , AZ ) cooled CCD camera were used . Hardware and image acquisition were controlled with the open - source μ - Manager device adapter library ( www . micromanager . org ) through a custom Java user interface . To quantify growth cone advance 1 h before and after 5 - HT addition in culture , a Nikon Eclipse TE300 microscope equipped with a Photometrics Quantix 57 backilluminated cooled CCD camera and MetaMorph instru - mentation control software were used ( Molecular Devices , Sunny - vale , CA ) . The displacement of growth cone’s leading edge along the presumed growth axis in 1 h was used to depict neurite outgrowth . Cloning A . californica cofilin1 ( apCofilin1 ) and A . californica cofilin2 ( apCofilin2 ) Primers ( apCofilin1 for and apCofilin1 rev ; apCofilin2 for and apCofilin2 rev ) were designed to amplify apCofilin1 and apCofilin2 from cDNA while introducing Nco I sites at the initiation codon and Bam HI restriction sites after the stop codon . Extra nucleotides were included outside the restriction sites to allow efficient digestion of PCR products . PCR was performed using Herculase polymerase ( Stratagene , Santa Clara , CA ) . A cDNA library was constructed using mRNA extracted from bag cell neurons .

A 50 - pixel - wide line was drawn from the leading edge to 1 . 5 × peripheral domain ( P domain ) width along the presumed growth axis . Average intensity was measured with the plot profile function in ImageJ ( National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , MD ) and the data exported to Excel ( Microsoft , Redmond , WA ) . Intensity was plotted versus distance normalized by growth cone size for population analysis of line scans . Distance was normal - ized by setting the beginning ( left end ) of the lines scan at the lead - ing edge and letting the two - thirds position be the peripheral – central domain interface . Alternatively , to compare phosphorylated cofilin normalized to total cofilin in P domain under different condi - tions , the peripheral domain was divided into three equal annular sectors parallel to the leading edge , and average intensities in sectors 1 and 3 were calculated ( Figure 8D , inset ) and compared between different conditions . 4848 | X . - F .
