Dynasore signiﬁcantly suppressed serum - induced lamellipodia formation in U2OS cell . Dynasore also destabilized F - actin in resting cells , which caused the retraction of the plasma membrane . A certain amount of dynamin 2 in U2OS cells localized along F - actin , and co - localized with cortactin , a physiological binding partner of dynamin and F - actin . However , these associations of dynamin were partially disrupted by dynasore treatment . Furthermore , invasion activity of H1080 cell , a lung cancer cell line , was suppressed by approximately 40 % with dyna - sore treatment . These results strongly suggest that dynasore potently destabilizes F - actin , and the effect implies dynamin . Dynasore or its derivative would be suitable candidates as potent anti - cancer drugs .

Introduction Dynamicchangesoftheactincytoskeletonarebasisforavarietyof cellular events including cell adhesion , motility and cancer invasion , endocytosis , andphagocytosis [ 1 ] . Cellmigrationandcancercellinva - sion are led by pseudopodia such aslamellipodia or ﬁlopodia , plasma membrane protrusive structure enriched with F - actin . Two dimen - sionally or three dimensionally constructed F - actin meshwork pro - vides driving force for membrane dynamics to generate pseudopodia . The actin undergoes active polymerization / de - poly - merization cycle , and speciﬁc actin effector proteins are responsible fortheproperspatio - temporalregulationofactinpolymerization [ 2 ] . Dynamins , large GTPase , are composed of three isoforms , dyn - amin 1 – 3 [ 3 ] , and well characterized as a ﬁssion protein in clathrin mediated endocytosis [ 4 ] . Implication of dynamin in actin dynam - ics has been sporadically suggested from observations of dynamin in actin - rich structures , such as growth cones [ 5 ] , podosomes [ 6 ] , invadopodia [ 7 ] , lamellipodia and dorsal membrane rufﬂes [ 8 – 10 ] , and phagocytic cups [ 11 , 12 ] . Furthermore , over - expression of dynamin K44A mutant changes actin cytoskeleton [ 13 ] . Dynamin was later found to bind to cortactin , F - actin binding pro - tein [ 10 ] . Dynamin GTPase activity is implicated in cortactin / Arp2 / 3 - dependent actin polymerization [ 14 ] , morphology , and turnover of actin ﬁlaments [ 14 , 15 ] . However , the precise mechanisms by which dynamin regulates actin dynamics are largely unknown . In search of speciﬁc inhibitor for dynamin GTPase , Macia and colleagues have identiﬁed dynasore as a non - competitive inhibitor [ 16 ] . Dynasore , a membrane permeable small molecule , decreases endocytosis , cell spreading , and cell attachment [ 16 ] . Since the dis - covery of dynasore , the reagent has been widely used for analyzing dynamin - dependent endocytosis [ 17 ] . Recently , we found that dynasore inhibits phagocytosis , an ac - tin - dependent cellular event , and that dynasore strongly decreases F - actin formation in vitro [ 12 ] , suggesting that dynasore affects on the actin dynamics . In this study , we examined effects of dynasore on stability of F - actin in vitro . Effects of dynasore on the formation of lamellipodia and cancer cell invasion , both of which are sup - ported by active remodeling of F - actin , were also analyzed .

( Osaka , Japan ) . Anti - dynamin 2 poly - clonal antibodies ( Santa Cruz Biotechnologies , CA ) , anti - cortactin monoclonal antibodies ( clone 4F - 11 , Millipore , MA ) and Alexa 488 - phalloidin ( Life Technologies Corp . , CA ) were used in the study . Animals . Ten - week - old C57BL / 6J male mice were purchased from SLC , Inc . ( Hamamatsu , Japan ) and Shimizu Laboratory Sup - plies Co . ( Kyoto , Japan ) , and maintained in a speciﬁc pathogen - free environment with free access to food and water at the laboratory animal center of Okayama University . The animals were housed and handled in accordance with the Okayama University Animal Research Committee Guidelines . Cell culture . U2OS ( ATCC No . : HTB 96 ) and H1080 cells ( ATCC No . : CRL - 12012 ) were cultured in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium ( DMEM ; Life Technologies Corp . , CA ) with 10 % fetal bo - vine serum ( FBS ; Life Technologies Corp . , CA ) at 37 (cid:3) C in humidiﬁed air with a 5 % CO 2 atmosphere . To induce lamellipodia formation , the cells were cultured in ser - um - free DMEM for more than 16 h . The serum - starved cells were pre - incubated with dynasore at indicated concentrations for 30 min , then stimulated with 10 % FBS in DMEM for 40 min at 37 (cid:3) C in the presence or absence of dynasore in 3 % DMSO . For neg - ative control samples , 3 % DMSO was applied . To wash out dyna - sore , cells were quickly washed out twice with FBS - free DMEM , and then incubated in 10 % FBS - containing DMEM for 40 min . To assess lamellipodia formation , cells were labeled with Alexa 488 - phalloidin , and analyzed by ﬂuorescent confocal microscopy . Cells with F - actin - rich membrane extensions were determined as lamel - lipodia - positive cells as described previously [ 18 ] . Microscopy . U2OS cells were double - stained by immunoﬂuores - cence and examined as described [ 19 ] using an inverted micro - scope ( IX - 71 , Olympus Optical Co . , Ltd . , Japan ) equipped with spinning disk confocal microscope system ( CSU10 , Yokogawa Elec - tric Co . , Japan ) and a CoolSNAP - HQ camera ( Roper Industries , FL ) . The system was steered by Metamorph software ( Molecular De - vices Corp . , PA ) . For live imaging , cells ( 1 (cid:2) 10 4 cells / coverslip ) were cultured at 37 (cid:3) C for 3 days on collagen type I - coated cover slips ( 12 mm in diameter ) . Live - cell confocal time - lapsed images were taken using a spinning disk confocal microscope described above . Images were automatically captured every 10 s . When necessary , images were further processed using Adobe photoshop and Illustrator software . In vitro actin assay . Quantitative analysis of F - actin was carried out using pyrene - actin ( Cytoskeleton , MA ) [ 19 ] . To assess F - actin disassembly in brain cytosol , mouse brain cytosol ( 12 mg / ml ) was prepared as previously [ 19 ] , and supplemented with 0 . 3 mg / mlpyr - ene - actin and ATP generating system ( 1 mM ATP , 8 mM creatine phosphate , 8 U / ml phosphocreatine kinase ) in assay buffer ( 20 mM Hepes , 100 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 1 mM EDTA , 1 mM DTT , pH 7 . 4 ) . Themixturewasincubatedina quartzcuvetteat roomtemper - ature for 10 min , and then 120 l M of liposomes containing 50 % phosphatidylcholine ( PC ) and 50 % phosphatidylserine ( PS ) were added to the mixture . Pyrene ﬂuorescence was measured at 407 nm with excitation at 365 nm in a F - 2500 ﬂuorescence spectro - photometer ( Hitachi Co . , Ltd . , Japan ) with a 10 - nm slit width . After F - actin formation was reached to plateau , approximately within 20 min , dynasore , Mycalolide B or cytochalasin D was added . To assess direct effect of the reagents on F - actin disassembly , F - actin was formed from 0 . 3 mg / ml pyrene - actin ( Cytoskeleton , MA ) at room temperature for 30 min in F - buffer ( 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 50 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , and 1 mM ATP in 5 mM Tris – HCl , pH 7 . 5 ) . After F - actin formation was reached to plateau , dynasore , Mycalolide B or cytochalasin D diluted with G - buffer ( 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 in 5 mM Tris – HCl , pH 8 . 0 ) was added . Pyrene ﬂuorescence was detected with ﬂuorescent microplate reader ( MTP - 600F , Coro - na Electric Co . , Ltd . , Japan ) . For visual assay , 1 l M Rhodamine - actin ( Life Technologies Corp . , CA ) was added to 20 mg / ml of brain cytosol , and F - actin for - mation was induced by 120 l M liposomes as described above at room temperature for 30 min . Then , 40 l M dynasore , 10 l M Mycalolide B or 10 l M cytochalasin D was added and incubated for 15 min at room temperature . The mixtures were observed by ﬂuorescent confocal microscopy to assess actin de - polymerization . Cell invasion assay . Invasion assay was performed as described [ 20 ] using a 24 - well Matrigel invasion chamber ( BD Biosciences , Bedford , MA , pore size 8 l m in diameter ) . H1080 cells were seeded in the upper chamber at 2 . 5 (cid:2) 10 5 cells / well in serum - free DMEM . DMEM containing 50 % FBS ( used as a chemo attractant ) was placed in the bottom chamber . After incubation for 6 h , dynasore was added to both the upper and the lower chambers , and the cells were further incubated for 14 h to allow them to migrate through pores of the Matrigel - coated membrane , cells remained on the upper side of the membrane were scrubbed off and the membrane with invaded cells to the bottom side was ﬁxed with methanol and stained with toluidine blue . The number of invaded cells was determined by counting cells on micrographs taken at 200 - fold magniﬁcation , and total 15 different ﬁelds were analyzed ( ﬁve ﬁelds each from three independent experiments ) . Results Dynasore indirectly destabilizes actin ﬁlaments in vitro We recently demonstrated that dynasore inhibits F - actin for - mation and membrane extension during phagocytosis [ 12 ] . How - ever , it is unclear whether dynasore reduces actin assembly or F - actin stabilization . First , effects of dynasore on the stability of F - ac - tin were examined in vitro assay using pyrene - actin [ 12 , 19 , 21 ] . Pre - formed F - actin in the brain cytosol was rapidly disassembled by addition of dynasore in dose - dependent manner ( Fig . 1A ) . Sim - ilar F - actin - disrupting effect was observed by the treatment with Mycalolide B , a marine toxin that directly disrupts actin ﬁlaments [ 22 ] , whereas , cytochalasin D , which inhibits actin polymerization by capping barbed end , hardly de - polymerized F - actin ( Fig . 1B ) . Consistently , morphological observation revealed that F - actin was drastically decreased by dynasore or Mycalolide B , but not by cytochalasin D ( Fig . 1C ) . To examine whether dynasore and Mycalolide B directly disrupt actin ﬁlaments , F - actin was formed by incubating puriﬁed G - actin in the presence of Mg 2 + and K + , and then the reagents were added . While Mycalolide B de - poly - merized the F - actin , dynasore showed no effect ( Fig . 1D ) , suggest - ing that the effect of dynasore on F - actin stability is indirect . Dynasore destabilizes F - actin and inhibits serum - induced lamellipodia formation in cells Next , we examined whether dynasore destabilize F - actin in cells . For this purpose , U2OS cells , human osteosarcoma cell line , was induced for the formation of lamellipodia with serum in the presence or absence of dynasore . The presence of dynasore re - sulted in decrease of lamellipodia formation in dose - dependent manner ( Fig . 2A and B ) . Actin ﬁlaments were markedly reduced in dynasore - treated cells compared to that in control cells , but the effect was recovered by washing out dynasore ( Fig . 2A and B ) . Tubulin staining as a negative control showed no change ( data not shown ) . These results suggested that dynasore inhibits lamel - lipodia formation by disturbing actin dynamics . Live imaging of serum - starved U2OS cell performed in the presence of dynasore re - vealed that dynasore induces rapid retraction of cell membrane from the cell edges ( Fig . 2C ) . This observation supports that dyna - sore disrupts F - actin not only in pseudopodium - forming cells but also in resting cells . H . Yamada et al . / Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications 390 ( 2009 ) 1142 – 1148 1143 Dynasore disrupts co - localization of dynamin 2 and cortactin Given that dynasore was originally characterized as dynamin GTPase inhibitor [ 16 ] , and it affects on F - actin both in vitro and in vivo , we next examined localization of dynamin 2 along F - actin . In the absence of dynasore , substantial amount of dynamin 2 - posi - tive dots , 30 . 4 ± 2 . 7 % ( n = 10 cells ) , were found along F - actin in lamellipodiaof U2OScells . However , additionofdynasoreledtodis - sociationofdynamin2fromF - actin , anddynamin2 - positivedotson F - actin were reduced to 8 . 7 ± 2 . 2 % ( n = 10 cells ) ( Fig . 3A and B ) . Ithasbeenreportedthatinteractionbetweendynamin2andcort - actin , a F - actin binding protein , is involved in remodeling of F - actin [ 14 , 15 ] . Wethereforeexaminedtheeffectofdynasoreonthedistribu - tionofcortactinanddynamin2inU2OScellsbyimmunocytochemis - try . In the control cells , both cortactin and dynamin 2 were observed as numerous bright puncta in the cytoplasm ( Fig . 3C , upper panels ) . Quantitative analysis revealed that 40 . 7 ± 1 . 6 % ( n = 16 cells ) of the dynamin 2 - positive puncta were also positive for cortactin , which were visible as yellow dots ( Fig . 3C , upper panel inset ) . The co - locali - zationofdynamin2andcortactindroppedto16 . 2 ± 4 . 2 % ( n = 10cells ) in the presence of dynasore ( Fig . 3C , middle panels and D ) , but the ef - fect was partially recovered to 28 . 4 ± 2 . 5 % ( n = 12 cells ) by washing out dynasore ( Fig . 3C , lower panels and D ) . This result suggests that dynasore also interferes the interaction of dynamin 2 and cortactin .

Yamada et al . / Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications 390 ( 2009 ) 1142 – 1148 Dynasore inhibits invasion of lung cancer cell Since dynasore severely destabilizes F - actin both in vivo and in vitro , and it also prevents the formation of membrane extension , we next examined whether dynasore has inhibitory effect for can - cer cell invasion . First , we determined the experimental conditions for the invasion assay , because dynasore - treated cells showed loose adherence [ 16 ] . H1080 cells , human lung cancer cell line , were treated with increasing concentrations of dynasore for 14 h , and cell attachment was assessed . As shown in Fig . 4A and B , dyna - sore did not show apparent effect both on cell adhesion and cell shape up to 40 l M , but caused signiﬁcant detachment of the cells at 80 l M ( Fig . 4A and B ) . Therefore , we examined whether 40 l M dynasore affect the invasion of H1080 cells in Transwell invasion chambers . Signiﬁcant number of H1080 cells was attracted high concentration of FBS , and invaded through pored membrane of the chamber . In the presence of dynasore , however , the number of invaded cells was reduced approximately by 40 % ( Fig . 4C and D ) . Discussion In this study , we demonstrated that dynasore strongly destabi - lizes F - actin both in vitro and in vivo ( Figs . 1 and 2 ) . Application of dynasore led to reduction of lamellipodia formation in U2OS cells , and inhibition of cellular invasion in H1080 cells ( Figs . 2 and 4 ) . Simultaneously , dynasore drastically reduced dynamin 2 - localiza - tion on F - actin , as well as dynamin 2 / cortactin co - localization in U2OS cells ( Fig . 3 ) . These results indicate that dysfunction of dyn - amin by dynasore may lead to instability of F - actin . How does dynasore destabilize actin ﬁlaments ? Dynasore rap - idly de - polymerized actin ﬁlaments like as Mycalolide B , which is known to directly sever F - actin to G - actin , and to inhibit polymer - ization by sequestering G - actin [ 22 ] . However , dynasore did not af - fect on puriﬁed F - actin ( Fig . 1D ) , indicating that the reagent functions indirectly . We recently reported that dynasore strongly inhibits F - actin formation in cytosol by pyrene - actin assay [ 12 ] . There are three possibilities for mode of action of dynasore on actin dynamics , i . e . , inhibition of actin assembly , destabilization of F - ac - tin , or both . In this study , we have demonstrated that pre - formed F - actin in cytosol was rapidly disassembled by dynasore ( Fig . 1A – C ) , indicating that the reagent causes at least to destabili - zation of F - actin . Considering that dynasore acts on dynamin and inhibits the GTPase activity in non - competitive manner [ 16 ] , it is likely that effect of dynasore on actin dynamics via dynamin . Con - sistently , it has been reported that dynamin GTPase activity is re - quired for actin ﬁlament morphology , its turnover [ 14 , 15 ] and actin polymerization [ 12 ] . Furthermore , over - expression of dyn - amin K44A mutant changes actin cytoskeleton [ 13 ] . Accumulating evidences suggest that dynamin is implicated in formation of actin - based structures such as lamellipodia , rufﬂes , and phagocytic cups [ 5 – 12 ] . In addition , dynamin interacts or forms complexes with variety of proteins related to actin dynamics Washout + FBS 0 04 0 20 40 60 80 100 80 160 240 240 Dynasore ( µ M ) C e ll s w i t h l a m e lli pod i a ( % o f c oun t e d ce ll s ) A B C 0 4 8 12 16 20 + FBS F - Actin Control ( DMSO ) Dynasore Washout - FBS + dynasore - FBS ( min ) * * * * * * * * * Fig . 2 .

Yamada et al . / Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications 390 ( 2009 ) 1142 – 1148 1145 such as cortactin , a - actinin 4 , proﬁlin and Abp1 [ 10 , 23 – 25 ] . For example , cortactin binds to both dynamin 2 and F - actin at plasma membrane , and functions the formation of lamellipodia and rufﬂes [ 10 ] . In this study , dynasore disrupted co - localization of dynamin 2 with cortactin ( Fig . 3C ) , suggesting that dynamin 2 / cortactin inter - action might be essential for actin dynamics . Recently , dynasore has been widely used for analyzing dynam - in - dependent endocytosis [ 17 ] . Since dynasore destabilizes not only F - actin in lamellipodia , but also those in the resting cells ( Fig . 2 ) , one should carefully consider dynasore’s strong effect on actin dynamics in application of the reagent for analyzing endocytosis . Most of molecular targets of anti - cancer drugs currently in use are molecules involved in processes of cell division or DNA replica - tion , and few drugs target for actin dynamics . Given dynasore’s strong inhibitory effect on pseudopodium formation and invasion , dynasore or its derivative could be potential candidates for anti - cancer drugs that effectively suppress cancer invasion and metastasis . In conclusion , we demonstrate that dynamin inhibitor , dyna - sore , reduces F - actin stability and formation of lamellipodia in can - cer - derived cells . It is very likely that dynamin is involved in this effect . Precise mechanism involved in F - actin regulation by dyn - amin is to be studied in the future .
