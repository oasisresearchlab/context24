Stamatoyannopoulos 1 , 15 * To study the evolutionary dynamics of regulatory DNA , we mapped > 1 . 3 million deoxyribonuclease I – hypersensitive sites ( DHSs ) in 45 mouse cell and tissue types , and systematically compared these with human DHS maps from orthologous compartments . We found that the mouse and human genomes have undergone extensive cis - regulatory rewiring that combines branch - specific evolutionary innovation and loss with widespread repurposing of conserved DHSs to alternative cell fates , and that this process is mediated by turnover of transcription factor ( TF ) recognition elements . Despite pervasive evolutionary remodeling of the location and content of individual cis - regulatory regions , within orthologous mouse and human cell types the global fraction of regulatory DNA bases encoding recognition sites for each TF has been strictly conserved . Our findings provide new insights into the evolutionary forces shaping mammalian regulatory DNA landscapes . T he laboratory mouse Mus musculus is the majormodelorganismformammalianbio - logy and has provided extensive insights into human developmentaland disease pro - cesses ( 1 ) . At 2 . 7 Gb , the mouse genome is comparable to the 3 . 3 - Gb human genome in size , structure , and sequence composition ( 2 , 3 ) , and > 80 % ofmousegeneshavehumanorthologs ( 1 , 4 ) . Human - to - mouse transgenic experiments have collectively demonstrated that the mouse is ca - pable of recapitulating salient features of human gene regulation , often with striking precision and even in the case of human genes that lack mouse orthologs ( 5 ) . By contrast , comparative analyses of regulatory regions governing indi - vidual gene systems ( 6 ) , as well as the occupancy patterns of several TFs ( 7 ) , have highlighted the potential for cis - regulatory divergence . However , broadereffortstoidentifyandquantifythemajorforcesshapingtheevolutionofthemammaliancis - regulatory landscape have been hampered by the lack of expansive and highly detailed regu - latory DNA maps from diverse cell fates that can bedirectlycomparedbetweenmouseandhuman . Deoxyribonuclease I ( DNase I ) – hypersensitive sites ( DHSs ) mark all major classes of cis - regulatory elements in their cognate cellular context , and systematic delineation of DHSs across human cell types and states has provided fundamental insights into many aspects of genome control ( 8 ) . In conjunction with the Mouse ENCODE Project ( 9 ) , we undertook comprehensive map - ping of DHSs in diverse mouse cell and tissue types and systematically compared the result - ing maps to those from orthologous and non - orthologous human cells and tissues . We mapped DHSs in 45 mouse cell and tissue types including adult primary tissues ( n = 19 ) , purifiedadultandprimitiveprimarycells ( n = 10 ) , primary embryonic tissues ( n = 4 ) , embryonic stem cell lines ( n = 4 ) , and model immortalized primary ( n = 3 ) and malignant ( n = 5 ) cell lines ( Fig . 1A , fig . S1A , and table S1 ) . We identified between 74 , 386 and 218 , 597 DHSs per cell type at a false discovery rate threshold of 1 % , and col - lectively delineated 1 , 334 , 703 distinct ~ 150 – base pair DHSs , each of which was detected in one or more mouse cell or tissue types . The genomic distribution of DHSs relative to annotated genes and transcripts was similar to that observed in human ( 8 ) ( fig . S1B ) . On average , 13 . 5 % of DHSs marked promoters , with the remaining 86 . 5 % distributed across the intronic and intergenic compartments in roughly equal proportions ; the vast majority were located within 250 kb of the nearest annotated transcriptional start site ( TSS ) ( fig . S1C ) . However , average intergenic DHS - to - TSSdistancesinthemousegenomeweremarkedlycompressed ( median 48 . 7 kb versus 91 . 6 kb for hu - man ) relativetogenomesize ( 2 . 7Gbversus3 . 3Gb ) , indicating differential rates of genome remodeling within DHS - rich regions ( fig . S1D ) , with a pro - nounced difference in both size and density of distal elements ( fig . S2 , A and B ) . To gain insight into the evolution of mamma - lian regulatory DNA , we comprehensively inte - grated the mouse DHS maps with human maps generated using the same methods from 232 cell ortissuetypesfromtheENCODEProject ( n = 103 ) ( 8 ) and the Roadmap Epigenomics Project ( n = 126 ) ( 10 ) . These human maps collectively encom - pass ~ 3 million distinct DHSs from primary cells , adult and fetal tissues , immortalized and malig - nant lines , and embryonic stem cells ( table S2 ) . We used high - quality pairwise alignments and a conservative reciprocal mapping and filtering strategy to project the genomic sequence under - lying all mouse and human DHSs to the other species ( Fig . 1 , B and C , and fig . S3A ) . Collectively , 59 . 5 % of mouseDHSs ( 52 . 5 to 78 . 8 % per cell type ) could be aligned with high confidence to the human genome , of which 35 . 6 % ( 38 . 6 to 60 % per cell type ) coincided with a human DHS ( Fig . 1B and table S3 ) . The remaining 23 . 9 % ( 13 to 22 . 7 % per cell type ) may correspond to human DHSs not yet defined , or to human lineage – specific extinction of an ancestral element . In support of the latter , mouse DHSs aligning outside of human DHSs showed excess sequence diver - gence , as evidenced by fewer alignable or iden - tical nucleotides relative to mouse DHSs that aligned with human DHSs ( fig . S3 , B and C ) . A smaller proportion of human DHSs aligned with a mouse DHS ( 17 . 3 % ; fig . S3A and table S4 ) ; how - ever , this was largely because there are more than twice as many DHSs identified in human . Given the breadthofmouseand human tissuesanalyzed , these values suggest upper and lower limits of regulatory DNA conservation between mouse and human . To trace the evolutionary origins and dynam - ics of individual regulatory regions , we aligned all mouse and human DHS sequences to > 30 vertebrate genomes spanning ~ 550 million years of evolutionary distance ( fig . S4 , A and B ) .

E - mail : jstam @ uw . edu RESEARCH | REPORTS within different branches of the evolutionary tree appeared frequently . Of the 80 % of mouse DHS sequences that predate the divergence of humansfromacommonancestor , only58 . 5 % were detectable in human , and comparison of mouse DHSs aligning to a human DHS or to a non - DHS region yielded nearly identical evolutionary pro - files ( fig . S4 , A and B ) . Overall , the proportion of DHSs that encompassed evolutionarily conserved sequence elements increased with alignability and conservation of DNase I hypersensitivity ( fig . S4B ) . Unexpectedly , however , ~ 40 % ofmouse - human shared DHSs lacked conserved sequence elements . The aforementioned trends are also reflected in patterns of human variation . Analysis of nu - cleotidediversity ( p ) withinDHSsindicatedgraded constraint depending on the extent of sequence and DHS conservation ( fig . S5A ) . Notably , mean p within human - specific DHSs approximated that of fourfold synonymous sites within coding regions , compatiblewithrelaxed ( butnotabsent ) nucleotide - level constraint . Despite decreased con - straint ( both evolutionary and recent ) , human - specific DHSs are significantly enriched ( versus all DHSs ) in disease - and trait - associated variants identified by genome - wide association studies ( fig . S5B ; permutation test , P null < 0 . 005 ) . The aboveresultsindicatethatalthoughmouse - human sharedDHSsarecollectivelyunderselectionoverevolutionarytimescalesandwithinhumanpop - ulations , the sequence information with the cis - regulatory compartment is continuing to evolve rapidly in both mice and humans . Whereas the overall density of mouse - human sharedDHSswashigheringene - proximalregions such as promoters , exons , and UTRs ( Fig . 1D ) , the relative proportion of shared DHSs ( to all DHSs ) increased markedly with distance from the TSS ( Fig . 1E and fig . S6 ) . From 10 to 50 kb upstream of the TSS , the proportion of DHSs that are shared with human ( average 27 % ) was lower than the average for intergenic regions ( average 31 % ; Fig . 1E ) , whereas in far distal regions this proportion increased substantially to a plateau of ~ 38 % . These data suggest that regulatory elements func - tioning over long range ( > 100 kb ) ( 11 ) constitute a genomic compartment that may be operation - ally distinct from a more rapidly evolving gene - proximal region , and hence less buffered against evolutionary alteration . The genesis of novel regulatory DNA sequen - ces appears to have played a substantial role in shaping the DHS landscape of both mouse and human ( Fig . 1B and fig . S2A ) . More than 50 % of the mouse and human genomes consist of re - petitive DNA ( 2 , 3 ) , which is proportionately re - flected in their respective DHS compartments ( fig . S7 , A and B ) . Species - specific DHSs were enriched ( relative to all DHSs ) for nearly all classes of repetitive elements ( fig . S7C ) , and 5 to 10 % of shared DHSs overlapped ancient repeats that pre - datemouse / humandivergence ( fig . S7D ) — afinding compatible with an important role for transpos - ons in the evolution of mammalian regulatory genomes . 1008 21 NOVEMBER 2014 (cid:127) VOL 346 ISSUE 6212 sciencemag . org SCIENCE % m ou s e DH S s s ha r ed w i t h hu m an ( an y c e ll / t i ss ue ) 1 . 3 million DHSs ( 45 cell / tissue types ) No sequencehomologyin human Sequencehomologyin human DHS in human Not DHS in human 41 . 5 % 23 . 9 % 35 . 6 % % mouse DHSs ( any cell / tissue ) Cerebellum Brain Cerebrum Thymus Liver Spleen Heart Lung Intestine Primitive tissues : ES cells , embyronic mesoderm B cells T cells Erythroid Genitalfat pad Fat pad Retina Kidney Skeletalmuscle % i n t e r gen i c DH S s s ha r ed w i t h hu m an ( an y c e ll / t i ss ue ) Distance from TSS 0kb – 50kb – 100kb – 150kb – 200kb 25 30 35 40 chr5 Shared DHS ( in any tissue ) Shared DHS ( in same human tissue ) DNase I Large Intestine DNase I Large Intestine No DHS sequence homology in other species Not DHS in other species ( any tissue ) Vgf Ap1s1 Serpine1 chr7 SERPINE1 AP1S1 VGF C7orf52 MOGAT3 20kb 0 20 40 60 0 20 40 60 80 Promoter Coding 5’UTR 3’UTRIntronIntergenic Genomic annotation 57 % 64 % 71 % 43 % 36 % 31 % 31 % Intergenic avg .

RESEARCH | REPORTS Transposable elements have recently been implicated in the rapid expansion of TF recog - nition elements ( 12 , 13 ) . To test the generality of this phenomenon , we estimated the total proportion of TF recognition sequences residing within species - specific DHSs that arose from transposon expansion during mouse and human evolution , which revealed substantial asymme - tries ( fig . S8 , A to C ) . For example , the recog - nition motif for the pluripotency factor OCT4 ( and other POU family TFs ) has been greatly expanded in the murine lineage on a LTR / ERVL element ( 12 ) , accounting for > 25 % of mouse - specific sites versus < 5 % in humans with a sim - ilar class of retroelement ( fig . S8A ) . By contrast , expansions of CTCF ( 13 ) and retinoic acid recep - tor recognition elements ( 14 ) have been driven chiefly by short interspersed elements ( SINEs ) in both mouse and human ( fig . S8 , B and C ) . These results indicate that expansion of TF rec - ognition sequences by repetitive elements is a general feature shaping mammalian cis - regulatory landscapes . DHS patterns encode cellular fate and identity in a manner that reflects both current and future regulatory potential and informs an organism ’ s developmental trajectory ( 15 ) . To visualize cell - and tissue - selective activity patterns , we clustered shared DHSs by normalized DNase I cleavage measured in each of the 45 mouse cell and tissue types ( Fig . 2A ) . The vast majority of shared DHSs ( 78 . 8 % ) displayed tissue - selective accessibility and were readily organized into distinct cohorts . A minority ( 21 . 2 % ) exhibited high accessibility across multiple tissue types , whereas < 5 % were consti - tutive ( Fig . 2B ) . Tissue - selective shared DHSs were enriched in distal regions ( fig . S9 ) and reflected both tissue organization and anatomic or func - tional compartments within tissues . For exam - ple , the 91 , 951 shared brain - selective DHSs in turn comprised four subclusters corresponding to distinct anatomical and developmental par - titions ( Fig . 2A , greenbox ) . Similarly , sharedblood - selective DHSs were subcompartmentalized into major hematopoietic lineages , including T , B , myeloid , and erythroid cell cohorts ( Fig . 2A , red boxes ) . Across all compartments , cell - or tissue - selective shared DHSs were preferentially local - ized around genes critical for the development and maintenance of their respective cell or tissue type ( fig . S10 ) . We hypothesized that tissue - selective shared DHSs should encode information critical for basic mammalian regulatory processes such as development and differentiation , and that this would be reflected in their TF recognition se - quence content . We thus computed , for each TF , the number of DHSs within each cluster that con - tained its recognition sequence , and compared this value to the overall distribution of recog - nition sequences within all shared DHSs . Tissue - selective DHSs showed pronounced enrichment for nearly all known lineage - specifying or cell SCIENCE sciencemag . org 21 NOVEMBER 2014 (cid:127) VOL 346 ISSUE 6212 1009 Fig . 2 .

Forexample , OCT4 , SOX2 , andKLF4recognition siteswerecollectivelyconcentratedwithinembryo - nic stem cell – selective shared DHS landscapes , consistent with coordinated expression of their cognate factors in embryonic stem cells . KFL4 rec - ognition siteswerealso enriched within intestine - and erythroid - specific DHSs , consistent with the known role of Krüppel - like TFs ( many of which share the KLF4 recognition sequence ) in intesti - nalepitheliogenesis ( 16 ) andinerythropoiesis ( 17 ) . Analogously , sequence elements recognized by the cardiac regulators MEF2A , EBF1 , FLI1 , and GATA4 ( 18 – 20 ) were enriched within heart - selective shared DHSs , compatible with important func - tions for these TFs or their cognates in defining theirrespectivecellfates ( 18 , 21 , 22 ) . Nonetheless , the tissue - selective enrichments we observed are consistent with the known cell - selective activity of TFs even after recognition sequences are sys - tematically grouped by similarity ( fig . S11 ) . To - gether , these results indicate that mouse - human shared DHSs densely encode regulatory informa - tion fundamental to diverse cell and tissue spe - cification programs , and thus collectively define a core mammalian regulon . Because most shared DHSs showed strong cell or tissue selectivity in mouse , we next asked to what degree these patterns were preserved in human . Computing the Jaccard similarity index over all possible combinations of mouse and human cell types revealed surprisingly limited similarity in the tissue - selective usage of shared DHSs ( fig . S12 , A to C ) , even when accounting for variability in DNase I cleavage density and peak identification parameters ( fig . S13 ) . Unsupervised hierarchicalclustering resultedin loosegroupings of shared DHSs by cells or tissues derived from the same progenitor or developmental lineage ( Fig . 3A ) . Weak correspondence between orthologous tissues suggested that a substantial fraction of shared DHSs had undergone functional “ repur - posing ” via alteration of tissue activity patterns from one tissue type in mouse to a different one in human ( Fig . 3 , B and C ) . Indeed , analysis of well - matched mouse and human tissue pairs confirmed substantial repurposing ranging from 22 . 9 to 69 % of shared DHSs , depending on the tissue ( Fig . 3B ) . Forexample , ofthe77 , 060 shared DHSs active in mouse muscle , 59 , 658 ( 77 . 4 % ) were also DHSs in human muscle ; theremaining 17 , 402 ( 22 . 6 % ) were DHSs in a different human tissue ( Fig . 3B , 7th from top ) . Overall , we found that at least 35 . 7 % of shared DHSs ( 12 . 7 % of mouse DHSs overall ) have undergone repurpos - ing ( Fig . 3D ) , chiefly affecting distal elements ( fig . S14 ) . Facile repurposing of regulatory DNA from one tissue context to another thus emerges asan importantevolutionary mechanismshaping the mammalian cis - regulatory landscape . To examine the conservation of individual TF recognition elements within the shared DHS com - partment , we distinguished between elements that were positionally conserved versus those that were operationally conserved ( i . e . , have arisen in - dependently at a different position within the DHS ) ( fig . S15A ) . In shared DHSs , 39 . 1 % of TF recognitionsequenceswerepositionallyconservedand19 . 6 % were operationally conserved ( Fig . 4A ) . Bothpositionalandoperationalconservationweresignificantlyconcentrated ( c 2 test , P < 10 − 15 ) within shared DHSs that maintained their tissue activity profile ( Fig . 4B and fig . S15B ) . Surpris - ingly , 41 . 3 % of shared DHSs ( chiefly repurposed DHSs ) lacked any positionally or operationally conserved TF recognition elements ( Fig . 4 , A and B , and fig . S15 , C and D ) . Additionally , the overall density of TF recognition elements did not differ substantially between shared DHSs with position - ally , operationally , or nonconserved TFs ( fig . S15E ) .

We next elaborated the relationship between conservationofTFrecognitionsitesandthemain - tenance of tissue accessibility patterns . Reasoning that known regulators of cell fate would play an outsized role in repurposing , we hypothesized that recognition sequences for such TFs would be preferentially maintained ( or gained ) in DHSs with conserved tissue activity spectra but would be preferentially lost at repurposed DHSs ( fig . S16 ) . We found this to be the case across a spec - trum of lineage - regulating TFs . For example , rec - ognition sites for the retinal master regulator OTX1 ( and other paired - related homeodomain family TFs ) within mouse retinal DHSs that had undergone repurposing in human were depleted by a factor of > 4 relative to orthologous DHSs that had conserved retinal activity ( Fig . 4C ) . Anal - ogously , sequence elements recognized by the in - testinal master regulator HNF1 b ( and by other POU - homeoboxTFs ) wereselectivelydepletedin repurposedintestinalDHSs , andthoserecognized by the major erythroid regulator GATA1 ( and by other GATA - type factors ) were selectively depleted inrepurposederythroidDHSs ( Fig . 4C ) . Overall , we foundthatrecognitionsitesforcellfate – modifying TFs were consistently depleted within repurposed DHSs ( Fig . 4D ) , linking the conservation and repurposing of DHSs to preservation versus turn - over of specific TF recognition sequences . The above results also suggest an incremental process whereby the composition of TFs within a given DHS is remodeled over evolutionary time via sequential small mutations ( 23 ) that could ultimately affect function and phenotype ( 24 ) . ThepresenceofasubstantialpopulationofsharedDHSswithoutconservedTFrecognitionsitesbutwithpreservedtissueselectivitypatternshigh - lights the plasticity of individual cis - regulatory templates . Such afinding indicatesthatthe same higher - level regulatory outcome may be encoded bymanydifferentcombinationsofinstructiveTFrecognitionevents . To investigate how the marked plasticity of TF recognition elements within the evolving cis - regulatory landscape is reflected in global pat - ternsof the typesand quantitiesof suchelements , we computed the global density of recognition sequences for each of 744 TFs within all mouse and human DHSs ( separately , and irrespective of conservation status ) from each cell or tissue type . This analysis revealed striking conservation of the proportion of the regulatory DNA landscape of each cell type devoted to recognition sites of each TF . Shown in Fig . 5 , A and B , are examples for mouse versus human regulatory T cell DHSs and formousebrain versus human fetal brain . In each case a linear relationship is observed , indicating that the proportion of the DHS compartment devoted to recognition sequences of each of the 744 TFs has been strictly conserved ( Fig . 5A ) . It is noteworthythatthisfindingobtainsacrossawidespectrumofTFsthatencompassdiversefunc - tional roles and biophysical mechanisms of DNA recognition . These findings are in marked con - trast to the weak conservation ( ~ 25 % ) of indi - vidual mouse regulatory T cell and brain DHSs ( Fig . 5 , C and D ) . TF recognition sequence con - tentvariedbetweencelltypesandbetweentissuetypes , with effector TFs selectively enriched within theircognatecelltype ( fig . S17 ) , andTF recognition sequence density was consistently more similar between orthologous cell or tissue pairs than between non - orthologous cells or tissues ( Fig . 5E and fig . S18 ) . It has been proposed that in large genomes such as mouse and human , maximization of the occupancy of any given TF requires an excess of its recognition sites , so as to ensure high occu - pancy of sites with critical regulatory roles across a range of TF concentrations ( 25 ) . Consistent withthismodel , themajorityofDHSsinboththe mouse and human genomes show relaxed se - quence constraint over evolutionary distances ( fig . S4C ) and within human populations ( fig . S5A ) . This model also predicts that the cis - regulatory programs of TF genes themselves should be more highly conserved than other gene classes . ComparingDHSswithin50kboftheTSSs of TF genes ( n = 911 ) relative to those of all ortho - logousgenes ( n = 14 , 666withatleast10identified DHSs in mouse ) revealed an overall increase in the conservation of TF - linked DHSs ( Wilcoxon rank sum test , P < 10 − 15 ) ( fig . S19 ) , particularly for DHSs surrounding the TSSs of genes within canonical TF families , such as Hox and Sox fac - tors . As such , TFs are distinguished from other trans - acting regulators in that their activity appears to directly shape their cis - regulatory landscape .

RESEARCH | REPORTS Taken together , our results have important implications for understanding the major mech - anisms and forces governing the evolution of mammalian regulatory DNA . Performing geno - mic footprinting on 25 of the cell and tissue samplesanalyzedhereinrevealsthattheeffectiveinvivorecognitionrepertoiresofhumanandmouseTFsarehighlysimilar , and that the high turnover of individual TF occupancy sites within regulatory DNA is accompanied by striking evo - lutionary stability at the level of regulatory net - works ( 26 ) . As such , the combination of a highly conserved trans - regulatory environment with a large genome ( under weakened selection ) may function to potentiate both the de novo creation and the cis - migration of operational TF binding elements . We speculate that high cis - regulatory plasticity may be a key facilitator of mammalian evolution by increasing the potential for innova - tion of novel functions in the context of an evo - lutionarilyinflexibletrans - regulatoryenvironment .
