AAV inter - nalization was postulated to proceed via a dynamin - dependent endocytic mechanism . Revisiting this , we ﬁnd that infectious endocytosis of the prototypical AAV , AAV2 , is independent of clathrin , caveolin , and dynamin . AAV2 infection is sensitive to EIPA , a ﬂuid - phase uptake inhibitor , but is unaffected by Rac1 mutants or other macropinocytosis inhibitors . In contrast , AAV2 infection requires actin cytoskel - eton remodeling and membrane cholesterol and is sensitive to inhibition of Cdc42 , Arf1 , and GRAF1 , factors known to be involved in the formation of clathrin - independent carriers ( CLIC ) . AAV2 virions are internalized in the detergent - resistant GPI - anchored - protein - enriched endosomal compart - ment ( GEEC ) and translocated to the Golgi appa - ratus , similarly to the CLIC / GEEC marker cholera toxin B . Our results indicate that—unlike the viral entry mechanisms described so far—AAV2 uses the pleiomorphic CLIC / GEEC pathway as its major endo - cytic infection route . INTRODUCTION Adeno - associated viruses ( AAVs ) are nonenveloped , single - stranded DNA viruses of the family Parvoviridae and the genus Dependovirus that are not associated with any known disease and show great potential as gene transfer vectors . AAVs depend on coinfection with a helper virus , such as adenovirus , herpes - virus , or papillomavirus for productive replication ( Grimm and Kay , 2003 ) . So far , 13 distinct AAV serotypes and more than 100 variants isolated from primates have been described ( Daya and Berns , 2008 ) . The AAV serotypes show distinct transduction efﬁciencies and tissue tropism both in vitro and in vivo . This vari - ability is in part a result of the diversity of AAV surface receptors , but other evidence suggests that the nature of the endocytic pathway taken by the virus is also critical for a successful trans - duction ( Bhrigu and Trempe , 2009 ; Hansen et al . , 2000 ) . Several studies have suggested that recombinant AAV2 internalization proceeds via a dynamin - dependent mechanism ( Bartlett et al . , 2000 ; Duan et al . , 1999 ) and , based on rapid uptake kinetics and partial colocalization with endocytosed transferrin , it was postulated that AAV2 is endocytosed via cla - thrin - coated vesicles . Interestingly , inhibition of dynamin could only partially block virus endocytosis , indicating that AAV2 can use alternative entry routes ( Duan et al . , 1999 ) . Another study suggested that AAV2 internalization was dependent on the GTPase Rac1 ( Sanlioglu et al . , 2000 ) , which is a major effector of macropinocytosis , a bulk ﬂuid - phase endocytic mechanism that is independent of clathrin and dynamin ( Doherty and McMa - hon , 2009 ) . Here , we revisit the internalization mechanism of recombinant AAV2 vectors ( rAAV2 , herein referred to as AAV2 ) into highly permissive HeLa and HEK293T cells , using methods speciﬁcally designed to minimize potential postentry effects of pharmaco - logical inhibitors or recombinant proteins . Because infection with wild - type AAV can be measured only in the presence of a helper virus , which would render the analysis of AAV2 endocy - tosis difﬁcult—if not impossible—we use recombinant AAV2 carrying reporter genes instead of wild - type virus and use the terms infection and transduction interchangeably . We found that AAV2 infection occurs independently of clathrin , caveolin , and dynamin , and that AAV2 infection is sensitive to the amilor - ide derivative EIPA but does not display other characteristics of macropinocytosis . In contrast , infectious entry of AAV2 is depen - dent on an intact actin cytoskeleton and membrane cholesterol and is sensitive to inhibition of the three main effectors of the clathrin - independent carriers / GPI - anchored - protein - enriched endosomal compartment ( CLIC / GEEC ) pathway—namely GRAF1 ( Lundmark et al . , 2008 ) , Cdc42 ( Sabharanjak et al . , 2002 ) , and Arf1 ( Kumari and Mayor , 2008 ) . AAV2 colocalizes with internalized GPI - GFP and the cholera toxin B subunit ( CtxB ) in early endosomal vesicles and is subsequently trans - ported to the Golgi apparatus together with CtxB . Interestingly , a fraction of AAV2 is internalized via a dynamin - dependent pathway , but this population does not play a major role in infec - tion . Taken together , our results indicate that—unlike any other virus studied so far—AAV2 uses the CLIC / GEEC endocytic pathway as a major infectious entry route . RESULTS AAV2 Infection Is Independent of Clathrin , Caveolin , and Dynamin AAVs contain a single - stranded DNA genome and require conversion to double - stranded DNA for gene expression . This essential step is rate limiting and can be inﬂuenced by genomic Cell Host & Microbe 10 , 563 – 576 , December 15 , 2011 ª 2011 Elsevier Inc . 563 B A C 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 Vector Cav1 DN % o f C on t r o l AAV2 - Luc transduction Tf uptake 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 Ctrl CPZ * * Transferrin uptake GFP - Eps15 DN Transferrin m C he rr y + c e ll s a m ong G F P + ( % o f v e c t o r c t r l ) 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 Vector Eps15 DN HeLa 293T AAV2 - cherry transduction m C he rr y + c e ll s a m ong G F P + ( % o f v e c t o r c t r l ) CPZ No drug Transferrin uptake Transferrin uptake ( HeLa cells ) DMSO Dynasore 80 μ M 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 Vector Dyn2 - K44A * 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 I n t r a c e ll u l a r AAV geno m e s ( % o f c t r l ) * HeLa 293T 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 D M S O D y na s o r e * Lu c i f e r a s e a c t i v i t y ( % o f c t r l ) E 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 D M S O D y na s o r e Lu c i f e r a s e a c t i v i t y ( % o f c t r l ) Ad5 - luciferase transduction * * noitcudsnart cul - 2VAA ekatpu 2VAA HeLa 293T F D HeLa 293T AAV2 - cherry transduction HeLa 293T AAV2 - cherry transduction m C he rr y + c e ll s a m ong G F P + ( % o f c t r l ) Dynamin K44A - GFP Transferrin Transferrin uptake G D M S O D y na s o r e 80 μ M Cav1 DN CtxB CtxB Uptake Figure 1 .

To rule out any potential effect of pharmacological inhibitors or ectopic protein expression on viral DNA second - strand synthesis , we used a recombinant AAV2 carrying a self - complementary mCherry cassette . This AAV vector does not depend on comple - mentary strand synthesis for transgene expression ( Wang et al . , 2003 ) . For some experiments , we used a recombinant AAV2 carrying a single - stranded luciferase cassette . These vectors are referred to as AAV2 - cherry and AAV2 - luc respectively . We ﬁrst investigated whether clathrin - or caveolae - mediated endocytosis is involved in AAV2 transduction . Clathrin - mediated endocytosis can be blocked by overexpression of a truncation mutant of Eps15 , a component of clathrin - coated vesicles ( Benmerah et al . , 1999 ) . As shown in Figure 1A , AAV2 - cherry transduction—measured by ﬂow cytometry—was completely unaffected by expression of GFP - tagged Eps15 D 95 / 295 ( Eps15DN ) , whereas transferrin internalization was dramatically decreased . To conﬁrm independently that AAV2 transduction is not dependent on clathrin - mediated endocytosis , cells were infected in the presence of chlorpromazine , a known inhibitor of clathrin - coated pit assembly ( Wang et al . , 1993 ) . Chlorproma - zine treatment did not reduce AAV2 transduction of HeLa cells , while transferrin uptake was inhibited by approximately 75 % under the same conditions ( Figure 1B ) . To minimize drug toxicity and to prevent pleiotropic effects on postentry steps of infection ( e . g . , endosomal escape or viral DNA synthesis ) , the virus was stripped from the cell surface by heparin treatment 30 min after the onset of endocytosis , and cells were then incubated overnight in drug - free medium to allow transgene expression . This procedure , which allows the removal of up to 99 % of surface - bound AAV2 ( Figure S1 ) , was used in all our studies involving pharmacological inhibitors . Under the conditions used , none of our inhibitors caused signiﬁcant toxicity . Next , we investigated the role of caveolae - mediated endocy - tosis in AAV2 transduction . To block caveolar endocytosis , we expressed caveolin - 1 N - terminally fused to EGFP ( Cav1DN ) , known to act as a dominant - negative mutant ( Pelkmans et al . , 2001 ) . Cav1DN expression reduced the uptake of CtxB , a marker of caveolar endocytosis ( Parton et al . , 1994 ) , by (cid:1) 50 % , but did not affect AAV2 transduction ( Figure 1C ) . Clathrin - and caveo - lae - mediated endocytosis are both dynamin - dependent , but dynamin is also involved in phagocytosis , ﬂotillin - dependent endocytosis , and interleukin receptor 2 - b endocytosis ( Doherty and McMahon , 2009 ) . Hence , we reinvestigated the role of dyna - min in AAV2 transduction . Inhibition of dynamin - 2 function by the dominant - negative mutant Dyn2K44A efﬁciently blocked trans - ferrin endocytosis but had little or no effect on AAV2 transduction in either HeLa or 293T cells ( Figure 1D ) ; instead , AAV2 transduc - tion was slightly increased in 293T cells expressing Dyn2K44A ( + 25 % ) ( Figure 1D ) . We also investigated the effect of dynasore , a potent and reversible dynamin inhibitor ( Macia et al . , 2006 ) . We observed an almost complete inhibition of transferrin uptake in HeLa cells treated with 80 m M dynasore ( Figure 1E ) , while AAV2 uptake was unchanged in 293T cells and only moderately affected in HeLa cells under the same conditions ( Figure 1E ) . Strikingly , dynasore had no effect on AAV2 transduction in HeLa cells and stimulated ( + 60 % ) transduction in 293T cells ( Fig - ure 1F ) . In contrast , infection of HeLa cells by a recombinant adenovirus type 5 vector carrying a luciferase transgene ( Ad5 - Luc ) was reduced by 65 % – 70 % following dynasore treatment ( Figure 1G ) , which is consistent with previous studies showing that Ad5 entry occurs in clathrin - coated pits and requires dyna - min ( Meier and Greber , 2003 ) . Together , these data demonstrate that although dynamin may contribute to AAV2 internalization to some extent , it is not strictly required for AAV2 infection . AAV2 Infection Is Sensitive to EIPA but Does Not Involve Macropinocytosis The above ﬁndings indicate that the infectious entry of AAV2 occurs mainly through a dynamin - independent pathway . Pre - vious studies reported that AAV2 endocytosis is Rac1 - depen - dent ( Sanlioglu et al . , 2000 ) , which would be consistent with AAV2 being endocytosed by macropinocytosis , a dynamin - inde - pendent endocytic mechanism mediating ﬂuid - phase uptake ( Ridley and Hall , 1992 ) . Expression of the dominant - negative mutant Rac1T17N ( Rac1DN ) efﬁciently blocked internalization of 70 kDa dextran , a ﬂuid - phase marker speciﬁc for macropino - cytosis , butshowedlittleeffectonAAV2uptakeinHeLacells ( Fig - ure 2A ) . Similarly , inhibition of Rac1 did not signiﬁcantly reduce transduction by AAV2 - cherry or AAV2 - Luc in 293T cells but dramatically blocked transduction by Ad5 vectors ( Figures 2B and 2C ) , which was expected , since Ad5 internalization is Rac1 - dependent ( Meier and Greber , 2003 ) . Flow cytometry conﬁrmed these results ; no signiﬁcant inhibition of AAV2 trans - duction by Rac1DN in either HeLa or 293T cells was observed ( Figure 2D ) , whereas constitutively active Rac1 ( Rac1Q61L ) slightly decreased transduction in both cell lines . We also tested several chemical inhibitors of macropinocytosis : 5 - ( N - Ethyl - N - isopropyl ) amiloride ( EIPA ) , an inhibitor of Na + / H + exchange ; LY294002 , a phosphoinositide - 3 kinase ( PI3K ) inhibitor ; IPA - 3 , a Pak1 inhibitor ; and EHT1864 , a Rac1 inhibitor . Only EIPA inhibited AAV2 transduction ( Figure 2E , left panel ) , whereas all compounds efﬁciently blocked macropinocytic uptake of 70 kDa dextran ( Figure 2E , right panel ) . EIPA reduced AAV2 entry by 50 % in 293T cells but not in HeLa cells ( Figure 2F ) . A hallmark of viruses that are internalized by macropinocytosis or other Rac1 - dependent mechanisms is that they trigger a robust increase of ﬂuid - phase uptake ( Mercer and Helenius , 2009 ) . In HeLa cells , 70 kDa dextran uptake was strongly enhanced by incubation with Ad5 at a moi of 10 5 virions / cell ( 5 - fold ) and by PMA ( 3 - fold ) , a phorbol ester known to increase macropinocyto - sis ( Swanson , 1989 ) , butwasnotaffected by incubation withhigh amountsofAAV2 ( 10 5 genome - containingparticles ( gcp ) percell ) ( Figure 2G ) . Similarly , 293T cells exposed to AAV2 did not inter - nalize the ﬂuid - phase markers 70 kDa dextran , 10 kDa dextran , or Lucifer yellow more efﬁciently than uninfected control cells ( E ) AAV2 - Luc uptake in HeLa and 293T cells treated with 80 m M dynasore .

Overall , these results indicate that , while AAV2 infec - tion is EIPA - sensitive , it does not occur via macropinocytosis .

When actin polymerization or depolymerization was prevented by treatment with cytochalasin D and jasplakinolide , respectively , we observed a signiﬁcant decrease in AAV2 endo - cytosis and transduction in both HeLa and 293T cells , whereas virus binding was unaffected or enhanced ( Figure 3B ) . We next sought to determine whether membrane cholesterol and lipid raft microdomains are necessary for AAV2 infection . Most inter - nalized AAV2 was resistant to cold triton extraction on live cells , while ﬂuorescent transferrin was almost completely extracted ( Figure 3C ) , which strongly suggests that internalized AAV2 particles are associated with cholesterol - rich detergent - resis - tant membranes ( DRMs ) . Consistently , in sucrose density gradi - ents with triton cell lysates , AAV2 was mostly recovered from the low - density fractions enriched in the lipid raft marker ﬂotillin1 . In contrast , transferrin and adenovirus 5 sedimented in triton - soluble fractions , which is consistent with internalization in vesi - cles derived from clathrin - coated pits ( Figure 3D ) . As expected for a lipid - raft - dependent pathway , AAV2 transduction and internalization were signiﬁcantly reduced in HeLa cells treated with methyl - b - cyclodextrin or ﬁlipin III ( Figure 3E ) . These studies could not be extended to 293T cells because both drugs induced rapid cell detachment , but the cholesterol synthesis inhibitor pravastatin reduced infection by 40 % in both cell lines ( data not shown ) . Overall , these results show that both actin and membrane cholesterol are necessary for AAV2 uptake and that AAV2 virions are internalized into a detergent - resistant endocytic compartment . AAV2 Infection Involves Effectors of the CLIC / GEEC Pathway The above results indicate that AAV2 infectious entry is mostly independent of dynamin and macropinocytosis and requires actin and cholesterol microdomains . These features are reminis - cent of the recently characterized CLIC / GEEC pathway , which mediates uptake of GPI - anchored proteins , ﬂuid - phase markers , and CtxB ( Doherty and McMahon , 2009 ) . CLIC / GEEC endocy - tosis is regulated by Arf1 and Cdc42 GTPases ( Chadda et al . , 2007 ; Kumari and Mayor , 2008 ) , which promote membrane curvature and local actin polymerization , respectively . CLIC / GEEC endocytosis is also critically dependent on the Rho GTPase - activating protein GRAF1 ( G TPase R egulator A ssoci - ated with F ocal Adhesion Kinase ) for the tubulation and scission of CLIC vesicles ( Doherty and Lundmark , 2009 ; Lundmark et al . , 2008 ) . We ﬁrst investigated the role of Arf1 and Cdc42 proteins in AAV2 transduction and entry . Dominant - negative mutants of Arf1 ( Arf1T31N ) and Cdc42 ( Cdc42T17N ) signiﬁcantly reduced AAV2 - cherry transduction in both HeLa and 293T cells , as measured by ﬂow cytometry ( Figures 4A and 4B ) . Interestingly , the constitutively active form of Arf1 ( Arf1Q71L ) also blocked AAV2 transduction , whereas constitutively active Cdc42 ( Cdc42G12V ) had no effect ( Figures 4A and 4B ) . AAV2 - luc trans - duction of 293T cells was also reduced by 60 % and 70 % in 293T cells expressing Cdc42DN or Arf1DN , respectively ( Figure 4C ) . Both Arf1DN and Cdc42DN inhibited AAV2 uptake ( 70 % reduc - tion ) ( Figure 4D ) , which strongly suggests that both proteins are directly involved in viral entry . Subcellular localization analysis using GFP - tagged Cdc42 showed that a large proportion of incoming AAV2 virions ( 40 % – 50 % pixel overlap ) colocalize with Cdc42 - positive peripheral endocytic structures at early time points ( Figure 4E , left panel ) . At later time points ( 40 min ) , colocalization could still be observed to some extent ( (cid:1) 30 % overlap ) , mostly in perinuclear structures . In contrast , Ad5 virions showed no signiﬁcant overlap with Cdc42 - labeled structures ( Figure 4E ) . Cdc42 activity is blocked by amiloride ( Koivusalo et al . , 2010 ) . Because we previously observed that the amilor - ide - derivative EIPA inhibits AAV2 transduction ( Figure 2E ) , we investigated the effect of EIPA on the internalization of cholera toxin B , which is internalized via both CLIC endosomes and caveolae ( Howes et al . , 2010 ; Kirkham et al . , 2005 ; Sabharanjak et al . , 2002 ) . EIPA reduced CtxB endocytosis by 50 % in HeLa cells , and CtxB that was internalized in the presence of EIPA was restricted to peripheral vesicles instead of being transported to the perinuclear area ( Figures 4F and 4G ) . Strikingly , inhibition of caveolar endocytosis by dynasore did not affect CtxB uptake , but simultaneous treatment with both dynasore and EIPA almost completely abolished CtxB internalization ( Figures 4F and 4G ) , which is consistent with EIPA being a potent inhibitor of CLIC / GEEC endocytosis . Similarly , EIPA and dynasore showed a strong synergistic effect on AAV2 transduction and endocy - tosis ( Figure 4H ) , which suggests : ( 1 ) that AAV2 can enter cells via two distinct endocytic pathways , dynamin - dependent endo - cytosis and CLIC / GEEC endocytosis ; and ( 2 ) that only CLIC / GEEC endocytosis leads to efﬁcient infection . We next investigated the role of GRAF1 in AAV2 infection . Ectopic expression of the dominant negative truncation mutant GRAF1 D 384 – 814 ( Lundmark et al . , 2008 ) led to a 30 % and 60 % reduction in AAV2 - cherry transduction in HeLa and 293T cells , respectively ( Figure 5A ) . GRAF1DN expression also reduced AAV2 - Luc transgene expression in 293T cells , but converselyincreasedAd5 - Luctransductionby2 - fold ( Figure5B ) , showing that GRAF1DN selectively modulates the AAV2 infec - tious pathway . GRAF1DN expression also inhibited AAV2 uptake in 293T cells ( 60 % inhibition ) , which conﬁrms that GRAF1 directly regulates AAV2 endocytosis ( Figure 5C ) . To conﬁrm further the role of GRAF1 in AAV2 infection , we depleted endog - enous GRAF1 with small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) . Transfection with two distinct siRNAs ( Lundmark et al . , 2008 ) efﬁciently reduced GRAF1 expression in HeLa and 293T cells ( Figure S2 ) and dramatically decreased AAV2 transduction ( Figures 5D and 5E ) . Again , GRAF1 knockdown speciﬁcally modulated the AAV2 infectious pathway , since Ad5 transduction was not decreased in GRAF1 - depleted cells ( Figure 5F ) . GRAF1 knockdown efﬁciently inhibited AAV2 entry in 293T cells ( 50 % reduction ) and to a lesser extent in HeLa cells ( 20 % reduction ) ( Figure 5G ) . This effect was greatly enhanced by dynasore treat - ment in both cell types ( 80 % reduction ) , conﬁrming the existence of two AAV2 endocytic pathways that are dependent on GRAF1 ( G ) Confocal micrographs of HeLacells treated as above .

At early time points , confocal micros - copy showed extensive colocalization of GFP - GRAF1 with inter - nalized AAV2 virions ( > 47 % overlap ) , but not with Ad5 virions ( 0 . 9 % ) . As observed with Cdc42 , the extent of colocalization diminished rapidly , since only 20 % overlap was observed 40 min after the onset of AAV2 endocytosis ( Figure 5H ) . Overall , the data indicate that AAV2 infectious entry occurs via CLIC / GEEC endocytosis , although a fraction of virions are internalized through dynamin - dependent endocytosis , which does not result in efﬁcient infection . AAV2 Internalization and Trafﬁcking via CLIC / GEEC Endosomes We next investigated whether internalized AAV2 virions accumu - late in the same endosomal structures as the prototypical CLIC cargos , CtxB and GPI - anchored proteins . AAV2 colocalized to a large extent with CtxB ( Figures 6A and 6B ) and internalized gly - cosylphosphatidyl - inositol ( GPI ) - anchored GFP ( Figure 6C ) , labeled with a ﬂuorescent anti - GFP antibody ( Figure 6C ) . Coloc - alization with CtxB and GFP - GPI was stable over time ( Fig - ure 6A – 6C ) , which suggests that AAV2 follows the same trafﬁcking route as CtxB and GFP - GPI from the plasma membrane to the perinuclear region . Consistently , AAV2 virions , but not Ad5 virions , could be recovered from GPI - and GRAF1 - positive membranes puriﬁed by immunoisolation with an anti - GFP antibody ( Figure 6D ) . In sucrose gradients , both GFP - GRAF1 and GFP - GPI were highly enriched in the same low - density fractions as AAV2 ( Figure 6E ) , and GFP - GRAF1 immunoisolation performed on pooled DRM fractions conﬁrmed that AAV2 particles were physically associated with GRAF1 - enriched vesicles in lipid rafts ( Figure 6F ) . The GEEC pathway involves rapid acidiﬁcation of endocytic vacuoles ( Kalia et al . , 2006 ) , so we evaluated the impact of modi - fying the endosomal pH on AAV2 transduction . As previously reported ( Bartlett et al . , 2000 ; Douar et al . , 2001 ) , baﬁlomycin A1 , an inhibitor of endosome acidiﬁcation , completely blocked AAV2 transduction when the drug was added within 1 hr after the onset of endocytosis ( Figure S3 ) . Consistent with previous studies ( Johnson et al . , 2010 ; Pajusola et al . , 2002 ) , AAV2 virions rapidly trafﬁcked to the Golgi apparatus , showing > 30 % coloc - alization with the Golgi marker giantin 2 hr postinfection ( Fig - ure 7A and 7B ) . Brefeldin A , a drug causing Golgi disassembly , dramatically inhibited AAV2 transduction ( Figure 7C ) . These results are consistent with a role for Golgi transport in AAV2 infection , although we can not exclude other effects of brefeldin A on different parts of the endosomal system . AAV2 trafﬁcking to the Golgi was unaffected in cells treated with dynasore but was reduced more than 10 - fold following EIPA treatment ( Figure 7D ) . Similarly , AAV2 transport to the Golgi was strongly impaired in cells overexpressing dominant negative mutants of GRAF1 ( 6 - fold ) , Cdc42 ( 10 - fold ) or Arf1 ( 7 - fold ) ( Figure 7D ) . Taken together , our ﬁndings indicate that AAV2 internalization into CLIC / GEEC endosomes is necessary for efﬁcient trafﬁcking and infection . DISCUSSION In this report , we demonstrate that AAV2 infectious entry in HeLa and 293T cells has all the hallmarks of CLIC / GEEC endocytosis : It is functionally dependent of GRAF1 , Cdc42 , Arf1 , the actin cytoskeleton , and membrane cholesterol , and internalized virions accumulate in endocytic vesicles enriched in CLIC / GEEC markers such as CtxB , GPI - anchored proteins , and GRAF1 . AAV2 is unique in its ability to use the CLIC / GEEC pathway as a route of infectious entry . We found that AAV2 transduction does not require clathrin , caveolin , or dynamin , which was unexpected because previous reports suggested that inhibition of dynamin reduces viral transduction by approx - imately 50 % ( Duan et al . , 1999 ; Ren et al . , 2007 ) . Notably , these experiments relied on adenoviral vectors for overexpres - sion of dominant negative dynamin ( dynamin K44A ) , and it is now well established that adenovirus or adenoviral vectors induce dramatic changes in cell homeostasis that may pro - foundly affect AAV2 trafﬁcking ( Johnson et al . , 2010 ; Xiao et al . , 2002 ) . AAV2 infectious entry is sensitive to EIPA but does not depend on macropinocytosis . EIPA reduced CtxB uptake , and this effect was drastically increased when caveolar uptake of CtxB was blocked by dynamin inhibition . These results are in agreement with recent reports showing that amiloride inhibits Cdc42 activity ( Koivusalo et al . , 2010 ) and , hence , likely reduces constitutive endocytosis of GPI - anchored proteins ( Cortese et al . , 2008 ; Tkachenko et al . , 2004 ) through the CLIC / GEEC pathway . Inhibi - tion of both CLIC / GEEC - and dynamin - dependent endocytosis was required to block completely AAV2 entry ( Figure 4 ) , which indicates that AAV2 can enter cells simultaneously via dyna - min - dependent and - independent mechanisms . Our results indicate that the route of AAV2 endocytosis determines the fate of internalized virions and the efﬁciency of infection ; appar - ently only CLIC / GEEC - mediated entry leads to efﬁcient trans - duction , presumably due to increased trafﬁcking of AAV2 virions to the Golgi apparatus ( Figure 7 ) . The retrograde transport mech - anism leading to Golgi accumulation of AAV2 is largely unknown . We did not observe extensive virion accumulation in early , late , or recycling endosomes labeled with Rab5 , Rab7 , or Rab11 , respectively ( data not shown ) , suggesting that AAV2 might bypass the classical endosomal system to reach the Golgi appa - ratus , although we cannot rigorously exclude a role of these proteins in AAV infection , even in the absence of signiﬁcant colocalization . In contrast , AAV2 and CtxB accumulated in the same transport intermediates from the plasma membrane to the Golgi ( Figure 6A ) , which is reminiscent of previous studies showing that GPI - anchored proteins and CtxB are transported to the Golgi in carriers devoid of classical endosome markers ( Nichols , 2002 ; Nichols et al . , 2001 ) . Interestingly , a recent high - throughput siRNA study performed on human aortic endothelial cells showed that AAV2 transduc - tion was strongly inhibited ( from 3 - fold to 15 - fold ) following siRNA knockdown of GRAF1 , Arf1 , or ARHGAP10 , another CLIC / GEEC effector ( Wallen et al . , 2011 ) . These observations suggest that our ﬁndings are likely valid in other cell types , including primary cells . To our knowledge , virus entry via CLIC / GEEC endocytosis has not been described so far . However , the characterization of other viral endocytic pathways has shown that viruses are able to take advantage of every available cellular internalization mechanism ( Sieczkarski and Whittaker , 2002 ) and that they frequently use more than one route .

Thus , clathrin - independent carriers may constitute an attractive and potent entry mechanism for viruses and other pathogens . In addition , CLIC endosomes are highly acidic ( Kalia et al . , 2006 ) , which creates a favorable environment for capsid or envelope modiﬁcations necessary for subsequent trafﬁcking / sorting steps of many viruses , including AAV2 ( Fig - ure S3 and Bartlett et al . , 2000 ) . Intriguingly , several viruses show similarities with AAV2 in their mode of entry . Human papil - lomavirus type 16 , lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus , and inﬂu - enza virus have all been associated with endocytic mechanisms independent of clathrin , caveolin , or macropinocytosis ( Mercer et al . , 2010 ) , and simian virus 40 ( SV40 ) can use a cholesterol - dependent , dynamin - independent pathway ( Damm et al . , 2005 ) . In Cav1 (cid:4) / (cid:4) cells SV40 internalization occurs in noncoated tubular vesicles ( Ewers et al . , 2010 ) similar to those formed by GRAF1 in vitro and in vivo ( Lundmark et al . , 2008 ) . Other viruses have been documented to bind to GPI - anchored proteins as their attachment receptors , such as enterovirus 70 and echo - virus with the decay - accelerating factor ( Lakhan et al . , 2009 ) . In light of our results , it will be interesting to investigate whether the CLIC / GEEC pathway is a more general mode of viral endocytosis . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Materials All commercially available reagents , plasmids , and the sequences of primers and siRNAs used in this study are described in Supplemental Information . Cells , Transfection , siRNA , and Viruses HEK293T and HeLa cells ( ATCC , Manassas , VA ) were maintained in DMEM with 10 % FBS ( Sigma , St . Louis ) , L - glutamine , and antibiotics . 293T cells were transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation . HeLa cells were trans - fected with GeneJammer ( Agilent , Santa Clara , CA ) or Lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) . Stealth siRNAs ( Table S1 ) were from Invitrogen and were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 . Recombinant AAV2 was produced and puriﬁed as previously described ( Gigout et al . , 2005 ; Grimm etal . , 1998 ; Hirosueetal . , 2007 ; Zolotukhinetal . , 1999 ) . Viraltitersweredeter - mined by real - time PCR with transgene - speciﬁc primers ( Table S1 ) . Adeno - virus type 5 ( Ad5 ) vectors carrying the mCherry or luciferase transgene were kindly provided by Kleopatra Rapti and Lifan Liang ( Mount Sinai School of Medicine , NY ) . Viral Transduction Assays For experiments involving chemical inhibitors , cells pretreated with inhibitors for 30 min were infected for 30 – 60 min at 37 (cid:3) C with AAV2 or Ad5 carrying the mCherry or luciferase transgene . Surface AAV2 was stripped with 100 m g / ml heparin for 10 min in the presence of drugs . Ad5 was removed by acid wash in DMEM , 25 mM sodium acetate ( pH 2 . 0 ) for 2 min on ice . Cells were then incubated overnight in drug - free medium . Luciferase activity was measured with Promega Luciferase Assay System in a Wallac luminometer ( PerkinElmer , San Jose , CA ) . Values were normalized to the total protein content of the lysates , measured by BCA assay . All pharmacological inhibitors were also tested with AAV2 - cherry with similar results ( data not shown ) . For experiments involving recombinant protein expression , cells were infected 24 hr posttransfection , incubated for 16 – 24 hr and assayed for ﬂuorescence by ﬂow cytometry or microscopy , or for luciferase activity . Virus Binding and Endocytosis Assays For binding studies , virus was added for 1 hr on ice before PBS wash . Cells were lysed in 1 % NP - 40 buffer , and DNA was extracted using Zyppy plasmid miniprep columns ( Zymo Research , Orange , CA ) with a 10 min incubation at 95 (cid:3) C in lysis buffer to denature viral capsids . Viral DNA was quantiﬁed by real - time quantitative PCR ( qPCR ) using Clontech SYBR green mix with trans - gene - speciﬁc primers . For AAV2 endocytosis studies , cells were infected for 1 hr at 37 (cid:3) C , then heparin was added for 10 min to remove surface - bound virus . Cells were tryp - sinized and low - molecular weight DNA was extracted . Viral genomes were quantiﬁed by qPCR with luciferase primers and are referred to as ‘‘internalized AAV genomes . ’’ Endocytosis Assays with Endocytic Markers Cells incubated on ice with ﬂuorescent transferrin ( 20 m g / ml ) , cholera toxin ( 1 m g / ml ) , dextran ( 1 mg / ml ) , or lucifer yellow ( 1 mg / ml ) were transferred to 37 (cid:3) C for the indicated times . Endocytosis was stopped by ice - cold PBS washes , and surface - bound dyes were removed by acid treatment for 2 min oniceinDMEM , 25mMsodiumacetate ( pH2 . 0 ) . Fluorescencewasmeasured by microscopy as the average ﬂuorescence of three different ﬁelds ( approxi - mately 200 cells per ﬁeld ) from three separate samples and quantiﬁed with Photoshop software ( Adobe ) . For GPI internalization , cells expressing GFP - GPI were incubated with Alexa 555 - conjugated anti - GFP antibody ( 1 : 400 dilu - tion ) on ice , washed , and transferred to 37 (cid:3) C . Surface - bound antibody could be stripped by removal of GFP - GPI with 0 . 5 U of PI - PLC ( Invitrogen ) for 30 min at 4 (cid:3) C ( > 95 % surface ﬂuorescence removal ; data not shown ) . The anti - GFP antibody was highly speciﬁc since no labeling of untransfected neighboring cells was observed .
