Clathrin Heavy Chain Is Required for Pinocytosis , the Presence of Large Vacuoles , and Development in Dictyostelium Theresa J . O ' Halloran and Richard G . W . Anderson Department of Cell Biology and Neuroscience , University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas , Dallas , Texas 75235 Abstract . To investigate the intracellular role of the clathrin heavy chain in living cells , we have used " an - tisense " RNA to engineer mutant Dictyostelium dis - coideum cells that are severely deficient in clathrin heavy chain expression . Immunoblots stained with an anti - clathrin heavy chain antiserum revealed that mu - tant cells contained undetectable amounts of clathrin heavy chain protein . Similarly , Northern blots showed an absence of clathrin heavy chain mRNA . Clathrin heavy chain - deficient Dictyostelium cells were viable , but exhibited growth rates twofold slower than parental cells . Whereas many morphological features of the mutant cells were normal , mutant cells lacked coated pits and coated vesicles . Clathrin - deficient cells were also missing large translucent vacuoles that serve as endosomes and contractile vacuoles . In the absence of clathrin heavy chain , mutant cells displayed three dis - tinct functional defects : ( a ) impairment in endocytosis of fluid phase markers , but competence in another en - docytic pathway , the phagocytosis of solid particles ; ( b ) defects in osmoregulation ; and ( c ) inability to complete the starvation - induced development cycle . C LATHRIN originally gained recognition as the basic subunit of polygonal lattices ( Pearse , 1975 , 1976 ) that control receptor - mediated endocytosis ( Ander - son et al . , 1976 ) . The past 16 years of research have focused on understanding the function of clathrin and clathrin - associated proteins in endocytosis ( Keen , 1990 ) . These studies indicate that the clathrin lattice has two main func - tions ( Anderson , 1991 ; Goldstein et al . , 1985 ) ; it converts planar segments of membrane into vesicles , and it clusters membrane receptors that use coated pits as vehicles for delivering substances to certain vesicular compartments . Understanding the molecular mechanisms that underlie these functions is a major emphasis of current day research ( Brodsky , 1988 ; Keen , 1990 ; Pearse , 1988 ) . Receptor - mediated endocytosis is a phrase coined to de - scribe the process of LDL binding , uptake , and degradation in human fibroblasts ( Goldstein and Brown , 1974 ) . We now know that cells use clathrin - coated vesicles in this pathway to internalize a variety of nutritionally important as well as opportunistic molecules from the plasma membrane ( Ander - son , 1991 ; Brodsky , 1988 ; Goldstein et al . , 1985 ) . In addi - tion to endocytosis , cells use clathrin - coated vesicles to selectively transport specific proteins to secretory vesicles and lysosomes from the trans - golgi network ( Brown and Far - quhar , 1984 ; Orci et al . , 1984 ; Tooze and Tooze , 1986 ) . Much less understood is the use of coated pits to modulate hormone - generated signals ( Schlessinger , 1980 ) or the func - Theresa O ' Halloran ' s current address is Department of Cell Biology , Box 3709 , Duke University Medical Center , Durham , NC 27710 . Correspon - dence should be addressed to Theresa O ' Halloran . tion of clathrin at sites of phagocytosis ( Aggeler and Werb , 1982 ) . An important experimental model that can give new in - sight into the function of coated membranes is a clathrin - deficient cell . To obtain such a cell , Doxsey et al . ( 1987 ) depleted the cytoplasm of CV - 1 cells of functional clathrin by microinjecting antibodies against the clathrin heavy chain . The microinjected cells exhibited a 50 % reduction in both bulk phase and receptor - mediated endocytosis without affecting the export of newly synthesized influenza hemag - glutinin to the plasma membrane . While these experiments demonstrate at least a partial role for clathrin in endocytosis but not in constitutive secretion , conclusions are limited by the experimental constraints of microinjection experiments . For example , the degree of clathrin depletion cannot be mea - sured . Moreover , because these clathrin - deficient cells can - not be propagated , the long - term effects of clathrin depletion on cell morphology and behavior cannot be studied . Clathrin - deficient cells have also been created in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae . The eviction of the clathrin heavy chain gene from this yeast generates cells that are either very slow - growing ( Payne and Schekman , 1985 ) or dead ( Lem - men and Jones 1987 ) ; depending on the particular yeast strain and its genetic background . Clathrin - minus yeast have been informative as to the role of clathrin in cellular pro - cesses such as the bulk constitutive secretion of plasma membrane proteins ( which appears to be normal in clathrin - minus cells ) and the localization of the Golgi - associated pro - tease , Kex2p ( which is not normal in clathrin - minus yeast ) ( Payne and Schekman , 1985 , 1989 ) . However , the relevance of many of the proposed functions for clathrin - coated vesi - (cid:14)9 The Rockefeller University Press , 0021 - 9525 / 92 / 09 / 1371 / 7 $ 2 . 00 The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 118 , Number 6 , September 1992 1371 - 1377 1371 cles cannot be tested in a yeast background . For example , studies of endocytosis and membrane recycling in yeast are hindered by the presence of a cell wall and low rates of en - docytosis . Structural studies are similarly limited : coated pits and vesicles are not detected in electron micrographs of yeast . We have accordingly focused our effort on developing an alternate experimental model in which to test clathrin func - tion . Coated pits and coated vesicles are readily detected within the cytoplasm of Dictyostelium discoideum . ( Swan - son et al . , 1981 ) . In addition to these structural hallmarks of clathrin - mediated traffic , this eukaryotic microorganism exhibits many behavioral characteristics that are more typi - cally found in complex eukaryotic cells including pinocyto - sis , phagocytosis , and a simple developmental cycle that is initiated by extracellular signals generated in response to starvation ( Vogel , 1987 ; Loomis , 1982 ) . In the current re - port , we have introduced antisense constructs in Dic - tyostelium to selectively inhibit clathrin heavy chain expres - sion . Against this genetic and functional background , we found that clathrin - deficient Dictyostelium have multiple , in - formative defects . Materials and Methods Construction of the Vectors The 2 . 8 - kb BamHI - BgllI fragment of the Dict ) ~ stelium clathrin heavy chain cDNA ( O ' Hatloran and Anderson , 1992 ) was subctoned in both orientations behind the Dictyostelium actin 6 promoter of the neomycin - selectable plasmid pDNeolI ( Witke et al . , 1989 ) , creating plasmids pTOI03S and pTO103A . The control plasmid , pTO103S , generates a 3 . 0 - kb RNA in the same orientation as wild - type clathrin heavy chain mRNA ( sense RNA ) . Protein is not synthesized from this RNA due to the presence of an in frame stop codon between the promoter and the BamHI - Bglll frag - ment . Plasmid pTO103A , which has the 2 . 8 BamHI - BgllI fragment in the orientation opposite to pTOI03S , generates RNA that is complementary to wild - type clathrin heavy chain mRNA ( antisense RNA ) . The two plasmids were introduced into Dictyostelium cells ( strain AX2 ) by calcium - phosphate precipitation followed by a glycerol shock ( O ' Halloran and Spudich , 1990 ) , allowed to recover overnight in HL - 5 ( Sussman , 1987 ) , and then cloned and propagated in HL - 5 with I0 / ~ g / ml of G418 . Clonal colonies transformed with either plasmid pTO103S or pTO103A were grown thereafter in individual petri dishes in HL - 5 that contained 10 ~ g / ml of G418 . Western Blots Lysates of cells transformed with either a control plasmid , pTO103S , or with pTO103A were prepared and boiled with sample buffer as described previ - ously ( O ' Halloran and Spudich , 1990 ) . Protein ( 50 # g ) from each sample was separated by electrephoresis on a 7 % SDS - polyacrylamide gel , trans - ferred to nitrocellulose , and immunostained with a polyclonal anti - Dictyostetium clathrin heavy chain serum diluted 1 / 1 , 000 with buffer A ( 5 % dried milk , 50 mM Tris - HCl , 150 mM NaC1 , pH 7 . 5 ) followed by t25I - labeled goat anti - rabbit IgG . Northern Blots RNA was prepared from ceils according to Nellen et aL ( 1989 ) and lO - ttg samples were separated by electrophoresis in the presence of formaldehyde on an agarose gel ( Sambrook et al . , 1989 ) . The gel was transferred to a ny - lon membrane ( ICN Biomedical , Irvine , CA ) in 20 (cid:141) SSC ( I (cid:141) SSC = 150 mM NaCI , 15 mM sodium citrate , pH 7 . 0 ) and then hybridized with a strand - specific probe labeled with alpha - 32pdATP . Single - stranded probes were synthesized from rnl3 templates that carried an 800 - bp frag - ment of the clathrin heavy chain eDNA oriented in either direction ( Sam - brook et al . , 1989 ) . Electron Microscopy Samples of each cell type were prepared for thin section EM by the method of Swanson et al . ( 1981 ) except that samples were stained with 4 % uranyt acetate and 2 % lead citrate . Measurement of Pinocytosis and Phagocytosis To measure pinocytosis , cells were incubated with 2 . 5 t ~ Ci / ml 3H - dextran ( 70 , 000 kD ; specific activity , 542 mCi / g ; Amersham Corp . , Arlington Heights , IL ) in HL - 5 at 20 ~ At various times , samples of 9 x 106 cells were diluted quickly into 10 ml of0 * C HL - 5 , washed three times with cold HL - 5 , lysed in Tris buffer ( 50 mM Tris , 20 mM sodium pyrophosphate , 5 mM EGTA , 5 mM EDTA , 1 mM PMSF , 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 , pH 7 . 5 ) and counted in a scintillation counter . Alternatively , cells were incubated in HL - 5 that contained 2 mg / ml fluorescein - dextran ( Mr 70 , 000 ; Molecular Probes , Eugene OR ) for 1 h at 20 ~ washed with HL - 5 , fixed with 3 . 7 % formaldehyde in buffer B ( 17 mM Na2HPO4 , 50 mM NaCI , pH 6 . 8 ) and then viewed with either phase or fluorescence optics . To measure phagocy - tosis , cells were incubated in HL - 5 for 10 rain at 20 ~ with bacteria that were labeled with tetramethytrhodamine ( Molecular Probes , Eugene , OR ) , washed in HL - 5 , fixed with 3 . 7 % formaldehyde in buffer B , and viewed with either phase or fluorescence optics . Photographs were taken with a Zeiss photomicroscope III using an automatic photometer . Exposure times for chc - cells and control cells were equivalent . Development Control or clathrin - deficient cells were grown axenically in HL - 5 and al - lowed to attach to the surface of plastic dishes . The axenic media was replaced with starvation buffer ( 20 mM 2 ( N - morpholino ) ethanesulfonic acid , 0 . 2 mM CaCl2 , 2 mM MgSO4 , 50 mM NaCl , pH 6 . 8 ) and incubated for the indicated time at 20 ~ The cells were then viewed and pho - tographed under phase optics .

Results Creation of Clathrin - deficient Cells Clathrin - deficient cells were generated by transfecting Dic - tyostelium discoideum cells with a plasmid that would pro - duce RNA complementary to the endogenous message en - coded by the Dictyostelium clathrin heavy chain gene . The hybridization of the endogenous " sense " message with the transfected " antisense " strand should inhibit the synthesis of clathrin . The 2 . 8 - kb BamHI - BglII fragment of the Dic - tyostelium clathrin heavy chain eDNA ( O ' Halloran and An - derson , 1992 ) was subcloned behind the Dictyostelium actin 6 promoter of the neomycin - selectable plasmid pDNeolI ( Witke et al . , 1989 ) in an " antisense " orientation to create plasmid pTO103A . As a control for the effects of transfection , a second plasmid , pTO103S , was constructed with the same BamH1 - BglII fragment in the opposite , " sense " orientation behind the actin 6 promoter . The presence of an initiation ATG and stop codons preceded the clathrin heavy chain eDNA to ensure that clathrin heavy chain protein was not produced by either plasrnid . Dictyostelium strain AX2 was transfected with either plas - mid pTO103A or pTO103S and grown under selection condi - tions . G418 resistant colonies were subcloned and main - tained as individual colonies derived from a single cell . Ini - tiaUy , we noted that some of the colonies transfected with the antisense plasmid grew at about one - half the rate of wild type cells . When sufficient quantities of both the sense and the slow - growing antisense cells were available , we used a Dic - tyostelium specific anticlathrin heavy chain serum ( O ' Hail - oran and Anderson , 1992 ) in an immunoblot assay to ana - lyze the cells for the expression of clathrin heavy chain . Fig . 1 A shows that cells expressing the sense strand ( control cells transformed with pTO103S ) had a single band of 190 kD ( Fig . 1 A , lane 1 ) . By contrast , cells that received the an - tisense plasmid pTO103A were devoid of any band at this mo - lecular weight ( Fig . 1 A , lane 2 ) . Both sets of cells contained a 70 - kD , nonspecific band , which served to ensure that equal amounts of protein were loaded in each lane . We estimate from the sensitivity of the immunoblot with this antibody that clathrin negative cells contained < 3 % of the wild type amounts of clathrin . We next assayed clathrin positive cells ( designated , con - trol ) and clathrin negative cells ( designated , chc - ) for the expression of both sense and antisense RNA ( Fig . 1 B ) . Con - O ' Halloran and Anderson Intracellular Functions for Clathrin 1373 trol cells contained both the endogenous 5 - kb clathrin mRNA and the 3 - kb RNA synthesized by the sense plasmid ( Fig . 1 B , lane 3 ) ; however , antisense RNA was not detected in these cells ( Fig . 1 B , lane 5 ) . By contrast , the chc - cells completely lacked clathrin heavy chain sense mRNA ( Fig . 1 B ) . Instead they contained abundant antisense RNA ( Fig . 1 B , lane 6 ) , as well as degradation products derived from this RNA . Morphological Phenotype of chc - Cells Ceils that lacked clathrin in the immunoblot assay were selected for further study . The control " sense " cells were in - distinguishable from untransfected , wild - type cells . Com - pared to control ceils , the chc - cells appeared in the light microscope to have a more rounded shape . In addition , the size of the chc - cells was much more variable . Many were slightly smaller than the control cells , and occasionally large multinucleated cells were observed . Low power electron microscopic images showed that the two sets of cells differed in overall shape , but some or - ganelles such as nuclei and mitochondria were identical ( compare Fig . 2 A with B ) . A remarkable feature of wild - type , axenic strains of Dictyostelium is that they contain numerous large vacuoles ( Fig . 2 A , arrows ) . Some of these are contractile vacuoles ( de Chastellier et al . , 1978 ; Patter - son , 1980 ; Quiviger et al . , 1978 ) that are thought to function in osmoregulation . Others are large endosomes , a prelyso - somal compartment that receives membrane and internal - ized material during pinocytosis and phagocytosis ( Padh et al . , 1989 ) . Comparison of 215 cross - sections of control cells with 312 cross - sections of chc - cells revealed that wild - type cells were filled with large translucent vacuoles , whereas chc - cells were almost completely devoid of these organ - elles ( compare Fig . 2 A with B ) . Occasionally a few translu - cent vacuoles were detected in some chc - cells ( 6 % of all samples examined ) , although these tended to be smaller than those found in wild - type cells . To determine whether chc - cells contained coated vesi - cles and pits , we selected and enlarged vesicle - rich areas from individual ceils . We counted 69 coated vesicles in the cytoplasm ( Fig . 2 C , arrows ) and 9 coated pits ( Fig . 2 C , in - set ) along the plasma membrane in 37 areas selected from wild - type cells . These coated structures were not uniformly distributed but were often clustered near the nucleus or the plasma membrane . Coated vesicles were particularly en - riched near the microtubule organizing center . We found an average of five coated vesicles associated with the six microtubule organizing centers we examined in wild - type cells . In contrast , coated vesicles were absent from chc - cells ( Fig . 2 D ) . No coated vesicles or pits were observed in 52 vesicle - rich areas enlarged from chc - cells . The seven microtubule organizing centers we examined in chc - cells were also completely devoid of coated vesicles . Other than the absence of large translucent vacuoles , coated pits and coated vesicles , all other aspects of Dictyostelium morphol - ogy appeared normal in chc - cells . Functional Defects in chc - Cells Dictyostelium cells can accomplish both phagocytosis , the internalization of solid particles , and pinocytosis , the inter - nalization of fluid ( Vogel , 1987 ) . To test the contribution of clathrin heavy chain to these endocytic functions , we mea - sured these processes in the mutant cells . We first assayed mutant and normal cells for their ability to phagocytose par - ticulate material ( Fig . 3 , A - D ) . Both types of cells were in - cubated with rhodamine - labeled bacteria for 10 rain at 20 ~ and viewed with either phase ( Fig . 3 , A and C ) or fluores - cence ( Fig . 3 , B and D ) optics . Both sets of cells appeared to ingest the same number of bacteria ( compare Fig . 3 B with D ) . Adjustment of the focal plane of the microscope Figure 3 . Endocytosis in control and clathrin - deficient cells . To measure phagocytosis ( A - D ) , cells were incubated with rhodamine - labeled bacteria , washed , fixed , and viewed with either phase optics ( A and C ) or fluorescence optics ( B and D ) , Both types of cells appeared equally proficient at internalization of bacteria . To measure pinocytosis ( E - H ) , cells were incubated in media that contained 2 mg / ml fluorescein - dextran ( Mr 70 , 000 ) for 1 h at 20 ~ washed , fixed , and then viewed with either phase optics ( E and G ) or fluorescence optics ( F and H ) . While control cells internalized and sequestered the fluid phase marker ( F ) , clathrin - deficient cells failed to internalize the marker ( H ) .

Con - j l , trol ceils ( open triangles ) or 5 chc - cells ( closed circles ) were incubated with 2 . 5 t ~ c / ml o ~ ~ , D a , e , 1 . * 120 3H - dextranmediaat20 ~ At various times , samples of 9 x 106 cells were diluted quickly into ice - cold buffer , washed , lysed , and counted in a scintillation counter . Clathrin - deficient ceils were significantly impaired in pinocytosis . confirmed that the bacteria had actually entered the chc - ceils and not simply bound to the cell surface . We obtained similar results when cells were allowed to internalize rhodamine - labeled yeast ( data not shown ) . To examine pinocytosis , we next examined the ability of mutant and wild - type cells to internalize bulk phase markers by pinocytosis ( Kayman and Clarke , 1983 ) . Each set of cells was incubated with 2 mg / ml of fluorescent dextran for 1 h at 20 ~ before viewing with either fluorescence ( Fig . 3 , F and H ) or phase optics ( Fig . 3 , E and G ) . Control cells avidly accumulated the fluorescent probe ( Fig . 3 E ) . By con - trast , there was an almost complete lack of dye uptake by the chc - cells ( Fig . 3 H ) . After a thorough search , we found a few positive cells , but the intensity of fluorescence in these cells was far less than wild type cells . To quantify the defect in pinocytosis in the mutant and wild type cells we then incubated the cells with 3H - dextran for various times at 20 ~ ( Fig . 4 ) . Control cells steadily ac - cumulated the 3H - dextran for the first hour of incubation before net uptake plateaued ( Fig . 4 , open triangles ) . Chc - cells , on the other hand , internalized very little dextran dur - ing this period ( Fig . 4 , closed circles ) . Initial rates of inter - nalization were eight times higher for control ceils than for chc - ceils . Since some of the electron lucent vacuoles that were absent from chc - cells have been identified as contractile vacuoles that function in osmoregulation ( de Chastellier et al . , 1978 ) , we compared the two cell types for their ability to adjust to osmotic stress . Both the chc - and the control cells were shifted from HL - 5 media to a low ionic strength buffer ( 20 mM 2 - ( N - morpholino ) ethanesulfonic acid , pH 6 . 8 ) . Chc - cells swelled and became round as they became engorged with water ( Fig . 5 , compare top left and middle ) . Subse - quently , chc - cells appeared to adjust to their osmotic envi - ronment and returned to their original size ( Fig . 5 , top right ) . Under identical conditions , control cells were able to com - pensate for the sudden change in their osmotic environment and regained their original size and shape ( Fig . 5 , bottom ) . When placed in an environment devoid of nutrients , wild - type Dictyostelium initiate a simple developmental program . Using pulses of extracellular cAMP as chemotactic cues , dispersed cells migrate together to form an aggregation cen - ter . This mass of cells ultimately transforms into a fruiting body consisting of two basic cell types : stalk cells and spore cells . Since clathrin - coated pits have been implicated in mod - ulating hormonal signals ( Schlessinger , 1980 ) , we were in - terested in knowing whether chc - cells would undergo this developmental pattern . Both chc - and control ceils were washed free of nutrients and incubated with starvation buffer . Cells were inspected at various times with a light micro - scope ( Fig . 6 ) . Wild - type cells initially became elongated and formed streams of migrating cells ( Fig . 6 ; control , 5 h ) . After 18 h , these cells had formed a well - developed aggrega - tion center ( Fig . 6 ; control , 18 h ) . By contrast , chc - cells Figure 5 . Response of clathrin - deficient and control cells to low osmotic buffer . Clathrin - deficient ( top , CHC - ) or control ( bottom , CON - TROL ) cells growing in HL - 5 media ( left ) were shifted to 20 mM Mes buffer , pH 6 . 5 , and photographed at the indicated times under phase optics . The 1 min timepoint ( middle ) shows that clathrin - deficient cells quickly swelled in this low ionic strength environment whereas the size and shape of control cells was unaffected . By 5 h in 20 mM Mes buffer , clathrin - deficient cells had resumed their original size and shape ( top right ) . O ' Halloran and Anderson Intracellular Functions for Clathrin 1375 Figure 6 . Development response of control and clathrin - deficient cells . Control ( CONTROL ) or clathrin - deficient ( CHC - ) calls were allowed to attach to the surface of plastic dishes . The nutritive media was replaced with starvation buffer to induce development and cells were photographed at the times indicated on the left . While control cells chemotactically streamed together ( 5 h ) to form a mound ( 18 h ) , clathrin - deficient cells failed to respond to starva - tion and did not form streams or mounds . appeared to be completely blocked in development ( Fig . 6 , chc - ) . They failed to undergo even the earliest stages of development , including the initial shape change ( Fig . 6 , chc - 0 h , 5 h ) and directed cell migration ( Fig . 6 , chc - 5 h , 18 h ) . Discussion Clathrin - deficient Dictyostelium cells are viable . However clathrin - deficient Dictyostelium cells display at least three distinct functional defects : ( a ) inability to take up bulk phase markers by pinocytosis ; ( b ) impaired osmoregulation ; and ( c ) inability to enter a developmental cycle . These properties do not appear to be strain - specific : clathrin - deficient cells from both the AX2 and the AX3 strains of axenic cells had identical phenotypes ( data not shown ) . Further , these char - acteristics were directly correlated with the lack of clathrin heavy chain protein . When chc - revertants were selected by growing the cells without ( 3418 , the wild - type phenotype returned concurrently with the expression of clathrin heavy chain ( data not shown ) . This study provides genetic evidence that the clathrin heavy chain is important for fluid phase pinocytosis . Several studies have shown that an alternate , actin - dependent uptake pathway functions in certain cells ( Hansen et al . , 1991 ; Sandvig and van Deurs , 1991 ; van Deurs et al . , 1989 ) . If a route for actin - mediated pinocytosis exists in Dictyostelium , it apparently cannot operate independently of the clathrin - mediated route . Actin - based pathways of internalization are not inactivated in the chc - cells . Mutant cells remained able to internalize particulate material , a process that in Dic - tyostelium is dependent on both actin and myosin I ( Fukui et al . , 1989 ; Hammer and Jung , 1990 ) . Therefore , the most direct explanation for the contribution of clathrin to pinocy - tosis is that clathrin - coated pits carry into cells fluid that is fortuitously trapped during coated vesicle formation at the cell surface . The large translucent vacuoles that are missing in chc - cells include both endosomes that receive internalized mate - rial ( de Chastellier and Ryter , 1983 ; Padh et al . , 1989 ) and contractile vacuoles that regulate osmotic pressure ( de Chastellier et al . , 1978 ; Patterson , 1980 ; Quiviger et al . , 1978 ) . The disruption of membrane traffic due to the ab - sence of coated vesicle formation most likely accounts for the deficiency in these organelles . This implies that there is a constant flux of membrane through these vacuoles and that clathrin heavy chain is required for the import of this mem - brane to endosomes and contractile vacuoles . The formation of endosomes from clathrin - coated vesicles has been shown in many other systems ( Goldstein et al . , 1985 ) . However , why clathrin - coated vesicles are required for the presence of contractile vacuoles is less clear . Morphological studies of algal cells have noted coated vesicles in proximity to contrac - tile vacuoles , suggesting that these vesicles might mediate membrane flow to maintain the contractile vacuole ( Manton , 1964 ; Weiss , 1983 ) . In Dictyostelium cells , clathrin - coated vesicles may retrieve contractile vacuole membrane from the plasma membrane after the vacuole has fused to expel water . Alternatively , clathrin - coated vesicles could play an essen - tial role in the biogenesis of contractile vacuoles ; for exam - ple clathrin - coated vesicles from the trans - golgi network may be required to transport proteins or membrane that are essential for contractile vacuole formation . Dictyostelium discoideum are found naturally in the low osmotic environment of moist forest soil . Without a rigid cell wall , this organism must constantly excrete water to main - tain cell volume . This is accomplished by water retrieving contractile vacuoles ( Patterson , 1980 ) . The current study confirms that these vacuoles play a role in water excretion because chc - cells , which appear to lack this organelle , were unable to normally regulate their cell volume when placed in a low ionic strength medium . Endocytic compart - ments in more complex organisms also appear to be involved in water transport . Clathrin - coated vesicles and endosomes in kidney collecting duct cells house water transporters that are recruited to the cell surface in response to antidiuretic hormone ( Brown and Orci , 1983 ; Brown et al . , 1988 ; Verk - man et al . , 1989 ) . Thus , the involvement of clathrin - coated vesicles in water transport appears to be common to simple unicellular organisms as well as highly specialized cells of mammalian kidney . Except for the morphological differences that were de - scribed , chc - cells look relatively normal . We were sur - prised , therefore , that chc - cells were completely unable to enter into the developmental program . One possible expla - nation for this behavior is that essential signaling molecules such as cAMP receptors ( Klein et al . , 1988 ) were not present on the surface of chc - cells due to impaired transport of membrane proteins from the Golgi . A more intriguing possi - bility is that coated pits play an essential role in signal trans - duction . Modulation of hormonal signals can be achieved in part by down regulating receptors through receptor - medi - ated endocytosis ( Schlessinger , 1980 ) . In fact , the cAMP receptor in Dictyostelium can be down regulated by inter - The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 118 , 1992 1376 nalization in response to the stimulation of developing cells with cAMP ( Wang et al . , 1988 ) . Regulation of receptor num - ber , as well as the spatial arrangement of the receptors on the cell membrane ( Bretscher , 1984 ) , may be a critical archi - tectural feature of the cell surface that allows the cell to move in the direction of a chemotaetic gradient . A final possibility is that coated pits are directly required for cell migration . Coated pits have been found in association with cell - substra - tum attachment sites ( Nermut and Butt , 1991 ; Nermut et al . , 1991 ) , although their exact function at this location is not known . Conceivably , they play a role in modulating the ac - tivity of adhesive molecules that are essential for cell move - ment ( Bretscher , 1989 ; Sczekan and Juliano , 1990 ) . If so , this function would be impaired in the chc - cells . Clearly the dramatic phenotype of the chc - cells offers a unique op - portunity to better understand the role of endocytosis in de - velopment . We would like to thank Dr .
