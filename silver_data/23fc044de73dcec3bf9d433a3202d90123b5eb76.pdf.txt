As DS can be diagnosed in utero , maternally transferred anti - AŒ≤ antibodies might promote removal of early accumulation of AŒ≤ from the CNS . A DNA - vaccine expressing AŒ≤ 1 - 11 was delivered to wild - type female mice , followed by mating with 5xFAD males , which exhibit early AŒ≤ plaque formation , similar to individuals with DS . Maternal AŒ≤ - specific antibodies provided transgenic offspring with passive immunization against AŒ≤ via the placental and subsequently lactation . Maternal antibodies reduced cortical AŒ≤ levels 4 months after antibodies were undetectable , along with alleviating short - term memory deficits and activation of the Fc ùõæR1 / Syk / Cofilin pathway in microglia . Sera from immunized dams facilitated AŒ≤ clearance by microglia in a Syk - dependent manner . These data suggest that maternal anti - AŒ≤ immunization is a potential strategy to alleviate cognitive decline in individuals with DS . 3 Introduction 1 Down syndrome ( DS ) , caused by trisomy of chromosome 21 , is the most prevalent genetic 2 cause for intellectual disability , affecting ~ 1 in every 750 live births ( Presson et al . , 2013 ) . 3 The life expectancy of individuals with DS has risen significantly in the past several 4 decades due to improved medical treatment of various comorbidities . Nevertheless , 5 individuals with DS have a shortened life - expectancy and accelerated aging compared to 6 the general population ( Carfi et al . , 2014 ) . DS shares common pathological symptoms with 7 Alzheimer‚Äôs disease ( AD ) ( Choong , Tosh , Pulford , & Fisher , 2015 ) , as individuals with 8 DS experience AD - related cognitive decline in their 4 th and 5 th decades of their lives 9 ( Choong et al . , 2015 ; Wiseman et al . , 2015 ) . This is preceded by a significant and 10 widespread AD - related pathology , detected as early as at the age of 12 years ( Burger & 11 Vogel , 1973 ) , which includes intraneural neurofibrillary tangles , amyloid - Œ≤ ( AŒ≤ ) 12 angiopathy , extracellular AŒ≤ neuritic plaques ( Alhajraf , Ness , Hye , & Strydom , 2019 ) , and 13 microgliosis ( Heneka , 2019 ; Raha - Chowdhury et al . , 2018 ; Tejera & Heneka , 2019 ) . This 14 is in part due to over - expression of the APP and DYRK1A genes , located on the triplicated 15 chromosome 21 ( Korbel et al . , 2009 ) , although AŒ≤ deposition is also promoted by non - 16 APP mediated mechanisms in this pathology ( Wiseman et al . , 2015 ; Wiseman et al . , 2018 ) . 17 In this respect , AŒ≤ - related pathology in DS shows high similarity to early - onset AD 18 ( EOAD ) , which results from an over - expression or mutation in the genes for presenilin - 1 , 19 2 , or amyloid precursor protein ( APP ) ( Chan , Furukawa , & Mattson , 2002 ) . Thus , AŒ≤ 20 pathology is etiologically and mechanistically shared between EOAD and DS ( Barone , 21 Head , Butterfield , & Perluigi , 2017 ; Butterfield & Perluigi , 2018 ; Tramutola et al . , 2018 ) . 22 As DS is typically diagnosed towards the end of the first trimester of the pregnancy , 23 4 individuals with DS present a unique group that can benefit from an early intervention 1 directed at AŒ≤ pathology . 2 Maternal vaccination can be administered during pregnancy against influenza 3 infection , Tetanus toxoid , reduced diphtheria toxoid , and acellular pertussis . 4 Pneumococcal , Meningococcal , and hepatitis A and B vaccines may be given in pregnancy 5 in specific populations . All the above - mentioned vaccinations can also be administered 6 post - partum , during breastfeeding , or both ( ACOG , 2018 ; Munoz & Jamieson , 2019 ) . 7 Thus , in many countries , maternal vaccination is a routine procedure during pregnancy , 8 post - partum , and during breastfeeding . 9 AŒ≤CoreS is a DNA vaccine coding AŒ≤ 1 - 11 ( a B - cell epitope ) fused to a Hepatitis - B surface 10 antigen ( HBsAg ) and a Hepatitis - B core antigen ( HBcAg ) , both contain multiple T - helper 11 epitopes that help facilitate antibody ( Ab ) production ( Olkhanud et al . , 2012 ) . The 12 AŒ≤CoreS construct was previously shown to delay cognitive decline and reduce human AŒ≤ 13 pathology in the 3xtgAD mouse model of AD ( Olkhanud et al . , 2012 ) . A modified vaccine 14 targeting murine AŒ≤ , which is triplicated in the Ts65Dn mouse model of DS ( Gupta , 15 Dhanasekaran , & Gardiner , 2016 ) , was also shown to induce anti - AŒ≤ Ab production that 16 facilitates clearance of soluble oligomers and small extracellular inclusions of AŒ≤ from the 17 hippocampus and cortex of Ts65Dn mice ( Illouz , Madar , Biragyn , & Okun , 2019 ) . This 18 was correlated with reduced neurodegeneration and restoration of the homeostatic 19 phenotype of microglia and astrocytes ( Illouz et al . , 2019 ) . These findings support the 20 notion that immunotherapy against AŒ≤ can slow the progression of dementia in DS , and 21 that an anti - murine AŒ≤ vaccination is safe to use in mice , as vaccinated wild - type ( WT ) 22 5 mice exhibited no cognitive or other behavioral abnormalities that could indicate 1 neurotoxicity ( Illouz et al . , 2019 ) . 2 In the current study , we hypothesized that maternal vaccination at the developmental and 3 post - natal stages coupled with an active vaccination post - partum would yield a continuous 4 immune coverage against AŒ≤ and a potent effect on AD - related neuropathology and 5 dementia in DS . 6 Mouse models of trisomy - 21 successfully recapitulate several aspects of DS , such as 7 cholinergic neurodegeneration , elevated levels of AŒ≤ and phospho - tau , and impaired 8 cognitive ability ( Rueda , Florez , & Martinez - Cue , 2012 ) . However , these current DS 9 models critically fail to recapitulate extra - cellular AŒ≤ plaque accumulation ( Illouz et al . , 10 2019 ; Wiseman et al . , 2018 ) . Indeed , several DS models , including the Ts65Dn strain , 11 overexpress murine AŒ≤ , which does not aggregate as human AŒ≤ , potentially due to three 12 amino - acids differences in the N - terminus . These differences have been reported to 13 modulate the binding of metal ions , which can influence the fibrillogenesis of AŒ≤ peptides 14 ( Atwood et al . , 1998 ) . The replacement of His - 13 for Arg in rodent AŒ≤ disrupts a metal 15 coordination site , rendering the rodent peptide less prone to zinc - induced aggregation in 16 vitro . Moreover , this region is essential for the specificity of amyloid interactions 17 ( Jankowsky et al . , 2007 ) . Thus , mouse models that encompass triplication of murine APP 18 exhibit elevated levels of APP protein and soluble AŒ≤ but not plaque pathology . 19 Humanized models of DS such as the Tc1 strain also lack plaque pathology due to a 20 nonfunctional human APP gene ( Gribble et al . , 2013 ) . Accordingly , these models lack 21 plaque - associated microglial pathology ( Illouz et al . , 2019 ; Keren - Shaul et al . , 2017 ; 22 Krasemann et al . , 2017 ) . These considerations led us to use the 5xFAD strain that 23 6 encompasses five mutations associated with AŒ≤ pathology in EOAD ( Oakley et al . , 2006 ) . 1 Indeed , the 5xFAD model has low construct validity in modeling DS , nonetheless , its face 2 validity in recapitulating early AŒ≤ plaque pathology in DS is satisfactory compared with 3 other AD and DS mouse models . 4 Herein , WT female mice were vaccinated against hAŒ≤ 1 - 11 or sham at 8w of age ( Fig . 5 1A ) . Vaccinated mice were then crossed with male 5xFAD mice to produce maternally 6 vaccinated transgenic and WT offspring . Following weaning , transgenic offspring were 7 actively vaccinated against AŒ≤ 1 - 11 or sham . The offspring were then tested for cognitive 8 capacity at 4m and were sacrificed for neuropathology assessment at the age of 5m ( Fig . 9 1A ) . AŒ≤ - specific antibodies from vaccinated mice directly affected the phagocytosis 10 capacity of primary microglial cells in a Syk - dependent manner . Our findings provide 11 evidence for a long - term effect of maternal vaccination on AŒ≤ - related pathology , long after 12 maternal Abs were not detectable in the circulation of the offspring . 13 14 15 Results 16 Maternal anti - AŒ≤ antibodies are transferred to 5xFAD fetuses and newborns . Female 17 C57BL / 6j mice ( 8w - old ) were immunized against AŒ≤ 1 - 11 using the AŒ≤CoreS - DNA 18 construct or HBsAg as control ( Fig . 1A ) . Vaccinated females produced a high anti - AŒ≤ Ab 19 titer compared with controls ( 156 . 4¬±18 . 98 , 0¬±0Œºg / ml , respectively , P < 0 . 0001 , Fig . 1B ) . 20 Both mouse groups generated anti - HBsAg titers , however , mice vaccinated with the 21 HBsAg alone produced a higher titer than mice vaccinated with AŒ≤CoreS that includes 22 AŒ≤ 1 - 11 and HBsAg domains ( 2 . 04¬±0 . 04 , 0 . 56¬±0 . 17 OD , respectively , P < 0 . 0001 , Fig . 1C ) , 23 7 possibly due to epitope competition . This is further indicated by a negative correlation of 1 r = - 0 . 5 found between anti - AŒ≤ and - HBsAg Ab levels ( P < 0 . 05 , Fig . 1D ) . The AŒ≤CoreS 2 vaccine elicited high IgG1 , IgG2a , IgG2b , and IgM titers against AŒ≤ ( P < 0 . 0001 , Fig . 1E ) . 3 HBsAg alone induced higher IgG1 levels ( 0 . 39¬±0 . 17 , 0 . 02¬±0 . 01 OD , respectively , P < 0 . 05 , 4 Fig . 1F ) and higher IgG2b levels ( 1 . 47¬±0 . 13 , 0 . 45¬±0 . 15 OD , respectively , P < 0 . 0001 , Fig . 5 1F ) compared with AŒ≤CoreS - vaccinated mice . 6 Following vaccination , WT females were mated with 5xFAD males to produce 7 hemizygous transgenic and WT offspring . For Abs analysis , circulating blood was taken 8 from 5xFAD fetuses at E17 , P0 , P7 , P14 , P21 , P28 , P42 , and P56 . Maternal Anti - AŒ≤ Abs 9 crossed the placenta to the fetuses , as early as E17 , compared with controls ( 8 . 73¬±0 . 31 , 10 0 . 46¬±0 . 17Œºg / ml , respectively , P < 0 . 0001 Fig . 1G ) . Strikingly , these Abs crossed to a greater 11 extent via lactation of the colostrum ( P0 ) and milk ( P7 - P21 ) . Ab levels gradually increased 12 in vaccinated fetuses compared with controls , with the progression of breastfeeding 13 reaching a peak at P14 ( 29 . 57¬±0 . 65 , 0¬±0Œºg / ml , respectively , P < 0 . 0001 , Fig . 1G ) . 14 Following weaning at P28 , Ab levels decreased to those of controls . At P42 , no Ab 15 difference was observed between the two groups ( 1 . 76¬±0 . 65 , 0¬±0Œºg / ml , respectively , 16 P = 0 . 12 , Fig . 1G ) . IgG2b was the most prevalent Ig isotype to transfer via the placenta and 17 lactation , peaking at P7 ( Fig . 1H ) . 18 19 Active immunization of maternally vaccinated 5xFAD pups induces mostly anti - AŒ≤ 20 IgG2b Abs . We next assessed whether maternal vaccination is comparable to active 21 vaccination at a young age . Prior to active vaccination , elevated levels of AŒ≤ - specific 22 IgG2b and IgM were found in maternally vaccinated pups compared with controls 23 B C A n t i - HB s A g se r u m I g G ( O D ) HBsAg A ÔÅ¢ oreS 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 2 . 5 * * * * A n t i - A ÔÅ¢ I g G se r u m c o n ce n t r a t i o n ( ÔÅ≠ g / m l ) HB s A g A ÔÅ¢ o r e S 0 50 100 150 200 250 * * * * A n t i - A ÔÅ¢ I g G ( O D ) A n t i - HB s A g I g G ( O D ) 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 r = - 0 . 5 , p < 0 . 05 I s o t y p e A n t i - A ÔÅ¢ I g s e r u m c o n c e n t r a t i o n ( O D ) I g G 1 I g G 2a I g G 2 b I g G 3 I g M I g A 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 2 . 5 A ÔÅ¢ C o r e S H B s A g * * * * * * * * * * * * n . s * * * * n . s A D E F A g e ( d ays ) A n t i - A ÔÅ¢ se r u m I g G c on ce n t r a t i on ( ÔÅ≠ g / m l ) 0 10 20 30 40 E 17 P 0 P 7 P 1 4 P 2 1 P 28 P 4 2 P 5 6 A b C o r e S H B s A g * * * * n . s A g e ( d ays ) A n t i - A ÔÅ¢ s e r u m I g G c o n c e n t r a t i o n ( ÔÅ≠ g / m l ) 0 10 20 30 40 E 1 7 P 0 P 7 P 1 4 P 2 1 P 2 8 P 4 2 P 5 6 A b C o r e S H B s A g * * * * n . s G H 0 42 56 30 68 150 ( 5m ) 120 ( 4m ) 96 Vaccination Birth Ab titer Behavioral tests Endpoint Dams Pups - 46 - 32 - 60 - 20 0 Mating & pregnancy Days before pups birth Days after pups birth Fig . 1 I s o t y p e A n t i - A ÔÅ¢ I g se r u m c on ce n t r a t i on ( O D ) I g G 1 I g G 2a I g G 2 b I g G 3 I g M 0 1 2 3 * * * * * * * * * * * * n . s * * * * I s o t y p e A n t i - HB s A g I g se r u m c on ce n t r a t i on ( O D ) I g G 1 I g G 2 a I g G 2 b I g G 3 I g M 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 2 . 5 * * * * * Age ( months ) a n t i A ÔÅ¢ I g M c o n ce n t r a t i on ( O D ) 1 2 . 5 3 . 5 5 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 * * * * * * Age ( months ) a n t i A ÔÅ¢ I g G 3 c on ce n t r a t i on ( O D ) 1 2 . 5 3 . 5 5 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 * * Age ( months ) a n t i A ÔÅ¢ I g G 2 b c o n ce n t r a t i on ( O D ) 1 2 . 5 3 . 5 5 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 1 . 2 1 . 4 1 . 6 * * * * * * * * * * * Age ( months ) a n t i A ÔÅ¢ I g G 2a c on ce n t r a t i on ( O D ) 1 2 . 5 3 . 5 5 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 * * * * * * * * Age ( months ) a n t i A ÔÅ¢ I g G 1 c on ce n t r a t i on ( O D ) 1 2 . 5 3 . 5 5 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 * * Q P L O N M Age ( months ) a n t i A ÔÅ¢ I g G c on ce n t r a t i on l og 10 ( O D ) 1 2 . 5 3 . 5 5 - 1 . 5 - 1 . 0 - 0 . 5 0 . 0 0 . 5 W T - / - - / - - / + + / - + / + * * * * * * * * * * * * * * A g e ( m on t h s ) a n t i - A ÔÅ¢ I g G c on ce n t r a t i on l og 10 ( O D ) 1 2 . 5 3 . 5 5 - 1 . 5 - 1 . 0 - 0 . 5 0 . 0 0 . 5 W T M - / A - M - / A - M - / A + M + / A - M + / A + * * * * * * * * * * * * * * I A n t i - A ÔÅ¢ I g se r u m c o n ce n t r a t i o n ( O D ) I g G 1 I g G 2a I g G 2 b I g G 3 I g M I g A 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 W T / C on t r o l 5 X F A D / C on t r o l 5 X F A D / M a t e r na l v a c n . s n . s * * * * n . s * * * * n . s J K M o t h e r s ' a n t i - A ÔÅ¢ I g G 2 b c on ce n t r a t i on ( O D ) P up s ' a n t i - A ÔÅ¢ I g G 2 b c on ce n t r a t i on ( O D ) 2 . 0 2 . 2 2 . 4 2 . 6 2 . 8 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 r = 0 . 6 , p < 0 . 05 A n t i - A ÔÅ¢ I g se r u m c on ce n t r a t i on ( f r ac t i on o f m o t h e r ' s t i t e r ) I g G 1 I g G 2a I g G 2 b I g G 3 I g M 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * A n t i - A ÔÅ¢ I g se r u m c on ce n t r a t i on ( O D ) I g G 1 I g G 2a I g G 2 b I g G 3 I g M 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 n . s n . s * * * * n . s * * * * A g e ( d ays ) A n t i - A ÔÅ¢ se r u m I g c on ce n t r a t i on ( O D ) 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 E 1 7 P 0 P 7 P 1 4 P 21 P 2 8 P 42 P 5 6 A g e ( d ays ) A n t i - A ÔÅ¢ se r u m I g c on ce n t r a t i on ( O D ) 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 E 17 P 0 P 7 P 14 P 21 P 28 P 42 P 56 I g G 1 I g G 2a I g G 2b I g G 3 I g M Fig . 1 .

Normalizing the pups‚Äô isotype concentration to those of their dams 1 revealed that IgG2b levels were 8 . 3 % of the mothers‚Äô circulating concentration , 2 significantly higher than IgG1 , IgG2a , and IgG3 ( P < 0 . 01 , Fig . 1J ) . A significant positive 3 correlation of r = 0 . 6 was found between dams‚Äô and pups‚Äô IgG2b levels ( P < 0 . 05 , Fig . 1K ) . 4 Normalized IgM levels were also high in pup circulation reaching 36 % of the mothers‚Äô 5 concentration , higher than all other isotypes ( P < 0 . 01 , Fig . 1J ) . 6 At 1m of age , both groups of AŒ≤ 1 - 11 and sham maternally vaccinated pups received either 7 AŒ≤ 1 - 11 or sham active vaccination , to create four experimental groups : No treatment M - / A - 8 , maternal vaccination only M + / A - , active vaccination only M - / A + , and combined maternal 9 and active vaccination M + / A + . A control WT group was administered with the control 10 vaccine only for behavioral and neuropathological baseline ( Fig . 1A ) . Blood Ab titers at 11 1m reflected maternal IgG , whereas Ab titers at 2 . 5 , 3 . 5 , and 5m reflected humoral response 12 to active vaccination . Following active vaccination , total IgG levels in the M - / A + and 13 M + / A + groups dramatically increased compared with M - / A - , M + / A - , and WT groups 14 ( 0 . 2¬±0 . 02 , 0 . 19¬±0 . 05 , - 1 . 09¬±0 . 01 , - 1 . 12¬±0 . 02 , - 1 . 11¬±0 . 09 log 10 OD , P < 0 . 0001 , 15 respectively , Fig . 1L ) . The yield of active vaccination in the M + / A + group was 18 . 24¬±4 . 09 - 16 fold the concentration of maternal Abs and remained high at 5m ( P < 0 . 0001 , Fig . 1L ) . 17 Exposure to maternal Abs in the M + / A - group was limited up to 1m of age , following 18 which Ab levels were undetectable ( Fig . 1L ) . In actively vaccinated offspring , IgG1 , 19 IgG2a , and IgG3 levels were higher than control at 2 . 5m ( P < 0 . 01 , Fig . 1M , N , O , 20 respectively ) and decreased to baseline at later time - points . As expected , levels of IgG2b 21 were elevated following vaccination and remained high until 5m of age in the M - / A + and 22 M + / A + groups compared with the M - / A - , M + / A - , and WT groups ( 0 . 4¬±0 . 1 , 0 . 75¬±0 . 25 , 23 9 0 . 05¬±0 . 01 , 0 . 03¬±0 . 005 , 0 . 06¬±0 . 009 OD , respectively , P < 0 . 001 , Fig . 1P ) . Accordingly , IgM 1 levels were elevated following vaccination among actively vaccinated mice at 2 . 5m 2 ( P < 0 . 0001 , Fig . 1Q ) , which decreased to baseline at later time - points . Summary of isotype 3 levels is available in Supplementary , Fig . S1 . 4 5 Maternal and active vaccination rescue short - term memory abilities and normalizes 6 exploratory behavior . To compare the effects of maternal and active vaccinations with 7 that of AŒ≤ on cognition , mice were tested in a battery of behavioral paradigms at 4m of age 8 ( Fig . 1A ) . Short - term memory capacity was assessed using the novel object recognition 9 ( NOR ) test ( Lueptow , 2017 ) . While WT , M - / A + , and M + / A + vaccinated 5xFAD mice 10 exhibited a clear preference to the novel object throughout the experiment , unvaccinated 11 mice showed no such preference after the first 20s of the trial ( 1 . 9¬±0 . 66 , 2 . 45¬±0 . 31 , 12 0 . 96¬±0 . 08 , - 4 . 4¬±0 . 03 cumulative discrimination index , respectively , P < 0 . 0001 , Fig . 2A 1 - 13 2 ) . M + / A - mice exhibited a preference to the novel object only during the first 60s ( - 14 1 . 9¬±0 . 89 , P < 0 . 01 compared with M - / A - , P < 0 . 0001 compared with M + / A + , Fig . 2A 1 - 2 ) , 15 suggesting that maternal vaccination alone partially ameliorated deficits in short - term 16 memory , while active vaccination and combined vaccination resulted in a full short - term 17 memory restoration . M - / A - mice exhibited lower exploratory behavior in this task , as they 18 spent less time near the familiar and novel objects together compared with M + / A - 19 ( 0 . 39¬±0 . 12 , 0 . 89¬±0 . 16 , respectively , P < 0 . 01 , Fig . 2A 2 , B ) . No difference was observed in 20 the spontaneous - alternation T - maze for short - term memory assessment ( P = 0 . 51 , Fig .

Combination of maternal and active vaccination rescues short - term memory abilities and normalizes exploratory behavior . A behavioral battery was conducted at 4m of age to assess the effect of maternal and active vaccinations on cognition . ( A 1 ) Short - term memory was assessed using the NOR test . ( A 2 ) Occupancy plots of NOR arena ‚Äì F ( familiar object ) , N ( novel object ) . ( B ) Total time near objects in the NOR test . ( C 1 ) Exploratory behavior in the OF test .

( D 2 ) Occupancy plots of the EZM . * P < 0 . 05 , * * P < 0 . 01 , * * * P < 0 . 001 , * * * * P < 0 . 0001 , two - way ANOVA , repeated measures two - way ANOVA . 10 the center of the open field ( OF ) arena ( Seibenhener & Wooten , 2015 ) , compared with M - 1 / A - , M + / A - , and M - / A + vaccinated 5xFAD mice ( 93 . 9¬±11 . 64 , 74 . 88¬±12 . 2 , 70 . 56¬±6 . 46 , 2 65 . 34¬±9 . 87s , respectively , P < 0 . 01 , Fig . 2C 1 - 2 ) . Exploration speed and distance did not 3 differ between groups ( P = 0 . 61 , P = 0 . 59 , respectively , Fig . S2A - B ) . These results imply that 4 a combination of maternal and active vaccination completely normalized exploratory 5 behavior in 4m - old 5xFAD mice . To rule out anxiety - related confounds , mice were tested 6 in the elevated zero - maze ( EZM ) ( Shepherd , Grewal , Fletcher , Bill , & Dourish , 1994 ) . The 7 fraction of time spent in the open / close zones of the maze did not differ between groups 8 ( P = 0 . 96 , Fig . S2C ) , suggesting no effect on anxiety - related behavior . However , the number 9 of entries to the anxiogenic open section of the EZM was lower among M - / A - mice 10 compared with M + / A - ( 0 . 87¬±0 . 09 , 1 . 33¬±0 . 08 , respectively , Fig . 2D 1 - 2 ) . Exploration 11 distance and speed did not differ between groups ( P = 0 . 15 , P = 0 . 15 , respectively , Fig . S2D , 12 E ) . These findings suggest that while no anxiety - like behavior is found , maternal and active 13 vaccinations enhance exploratory behavior among 5xFAD mice in the EZM . 14 15 Maternal vaccination reduces cerebral AŒ≤ levels in adult 5xFAD mice . Mice were 16 sacrificed at 5m to assess AŒ≤ - related neuropathology ( Fig . 1A ) . Cortical AŒ≤ 40 and AŒ≤ 42 17 levels were quantified using a modification of previously described sELISA ( Illouz , Madar , 18 Griffioen , & Okun , 2017 ) in soluble ( TBST - soluble ) , pre - amyloid complexes ( SDS - 19 soluble ) and insoluble - fibrillary ( FA - soluble ) AŒ≤ extracts . M + / A - and M + / A + mice 20 exhibited reduced soluble AŒ≤ 42 compared with both M - / A - and M - / A + mice ( 0¬±0 , 0¬±0 , 21 465 . 4¬±191 . 5 , and 143¬±112 . 3pg / mg , respectively , P < 0 . 05 , Fig . 3A ) .

SDS - soluble pre - amyloid AŒ≤ 42 2 was reduced in M + / A - and M - / A + but not in M + / A + treated mice compared with M - / A - , 3 ( 1 . 78¬±1 . 28 , 2 . 47¬±1 . 43 , 3 . 25¬±1 . 39 , 8 . 33¬±2 . 13ng / mg , respectively , P < 0 . 01 , P = 0 . 21 , 4 respectively , Fig . 3B ) . However , M - / A - mice were the only group to have elevated levels 5 of SDS - soluble AŒ≤ 42 compared with WT controls ( 8 . 33¬±2 . 13 , 0 . 54¬±0 . 34ng / mg , 6 respectively , P < 0 . 05 , Fig . 3B ) . Importantly , insoluble AŒ≤ 42 was reduced in maternally 7 vaccinated mice ( M + / A - and M + / A + ) , compared with unvaccinated and actively 8 vaccinated mice ( M - / A - and M - / A + ) ( 1063¬±249 , 937¬±303 . 1 , 2583¬±621 , 2093¬±466ng / mg , 9 respectively , P < 0 . 01 , Fig . 3C ) . No difference was observed in cortical insoluble AŒ≤ 42 10 between M - / A - and M - / A + ( P = 0 . 68 , Fig . 3C ) or between M + / A - and M + / A + ( P = 0 . 97 , Fig . 11 3C ) . Elevated levels of insoluble AŒ≤ 42 were observed in M - / A - and M - / A + compared with 12 WT controls ( 2583¬±621 , 2093¬±466 , 31 . 24¬±24 . 82ng / mg , respectively , P < 0 . 01 , Fig . 3C ) . 13 These findings suggest that active vaccination alone is insufficient in reducing insoluble 14 AŒ≤ 42 . Moreover , active vaccination did not yield additional reduction in already maternally 15 immunized mice , suggesting that early passive maternal vaccination results in a long - 16 lasting effect on either AŒ≤ accumulation , clearance , or both . 17 Maternally vaccinated mice ( M + / A - and M + / A + ) exhibited reduced soluble AŒ≤ 40 compared 18 with M - / A - and M - / A + mice ( 169 . 4¬±169 . 4 , 74 . 26¬±74 . 26 , 695¬±236 . 1 , 317 . 6¬±125 . 8pg / mg , 19 respectively , P < 0 . 05 , Fig . 3D ) . M - / A + mice exhibited a non - significant reduction in 20 soluble AŒ≤ 40 compared with M - / A - mice ( P = 0 . 22 , Fig . 3D ) . However , M - / A - was the only 21 group in which soluble AŒ≤ 40 was significantly higher than WT controls ( 695¬±236 . 1 , 22 0¬±0pg / mg , respectively , P < 0 . 05 , Fig . 3D ) . The SDS - soluble fraction of AŒ≤ 40 was lower in 23 12 all vaccination groups compared with unvaccinated mice ( 0¬±0 , 0¬±0 , 0 . 59¬±0 . 59 , 1 2 . 6¬±0 . 78ng / mg , respectively , P < 0 . 01 , P < 0 . 01 , P < 0 . 05 , respectively , Fig . 3E ) . Elevated 2 levels of SDS - soluble AŒ≤ 40 were measured in M - / A - mice compared with WT controls 3 ( 2 . 6¬±0 . 78 , 0¬±0ng / mg , respectively , P < 0 . 01 , Fig . 3E ) . While M - / A - mice exhibited elevated 4 levels of insoluble AŒ≤ 40 compared with WT controls ( 475 . 5¬±158 . 3 , 73 . 45¬±46 . 37ng / mg , 5 respectively , P < 0 . 01 , Fig . 3F ) , no difference was observed between 5xFAD groups 6 ( P = 0 . 13 , Fig . 3F ) . Insoluble AŒ≤ 42 / AŒ≤ 40 ratio ( Jarrett & Lansbury , 1993 ) was significantly 7 higher in M - / A - mice compared with WT controls ( 8 . 67¬±3 . 02 , 1 . 16¬±0 . 99 , P < 0 . 05 , Fig . 8 3G ) , with no difference from all other 5xFAD groups ( P = 0 . 13 , main effect maternal 9 vaccination , P = 0 . 16 , main effect active vaccination , Fig . 3F ) . To test whether the reduction 10 in cerebral AŒ≤ among maternally vaccinated mice is a result of enhanced clearance or 11 reduced production of AŒ≤ , hAPP levels were measured at the transcript and protein levels . 12 hAPP mRNA did not differ for both maternal ( P = 0 . 42 ) and active ( P = 0 . 35 ) vaccinations 13 ( Supplementary Fig . S3A ) , suggesting that reduced APP production cannot explain the 14 observed reduction in AŒ≤ . At the protein level , actively and combined vaccinated mice 15 exhibited a reduction in hAPP compared with untreated and maternally vaccinated mice 16 ( 0 . 76¬±0 . 65 , 0 . 65¬±0 . 1 for M - / A + and M + / A + , respectively , compared with 0 . 92¬±0 . 06 , 17 1 . 01¬±0 . 07 for M - / A - and M + / A - , respectively , P < 0 . 05 , supplementary Fig . S3B ) . This 18 effect accounts for only ~ 18 % of the final reduction seen in cerebral AŒ≤ levels and is 19 possibly due to neutralization of hAPP by antibodies . These results suggest that most of 20 the reduction in AŒ≤ levels is not due to lowered hAPP expression and is , therefore , 21 attributable to AŒ≤ clearance . Maternal anti - AŒ≤ IgG levels in offspring circulation 22 negatively correlated with insoluble AŒ≤ 42 levels at 5m of age ( r = - 0 . 43 , P < 0 . 05 , Fig . 3H , 23 13 S4A ) , whereas active vaccination showed no such correlation ( r = - 0 . 11 , P = 0 . 32 , Fig . 3H , 1 S4D ) . Similar correlations were found for maternal IgG2b and IgM levels ( r = - 0 . 4 , r = - 0 . 68 , 2 respectively , P < 0 . 05 , P < 0 . 001 , respectively , Fig . 3H , S4B , S4C ) , while active - vaccination - 3 derived IgG2b and IgM did not correlate with reduction in AŒ≤ load ( r = - 0 . 21 , r = - 0 . 1 , 4 respectively , P = 0 . 17 , P = 0 . 18 , respectively , Fig . 3H , S4E , S4F ) . M + / A - exhibited reduced 5 plaque density in the cortex compared with M - / A - ( 31 . 9¬±1 . 98 , 59 . 1¬±3 . 43 plaques / mm 2 , 6 respectively , P < 0 . 0001 , Fig . 3I - J ) . Accordingly , plaque coverage percentage was also 7 reduced among M + / A - compared with M - / A - ( 0 . 27¬±0 . 02 , 1 . 03¬±0 . 08 % , respectively , 8 P < 0 . 0001 , Fig . 3I , K ) . Active vaccination had a minor contribution to plaque density 9 reduction in already maternally vaccinated mice ( 40 . 15¬±2 . 32 , 35 . 55¬±2 . 23 plaques / mm 2 , 10 respectively , P = 0 . 49 , Fig . 3I - J ) . 11 Taken together , these findings provide evidence for a long - lasting effect of maternal 12 vaccination during developmental and postnatal periods on AŒ≤ clearance or accumulation , 13 with a limited contribution of active vaccination at early adulthood . 14 15 Maternal vaccination induces long - term FcRs upregulation in the brain . A limited - 16 time exposure of offspring to maternal Ab resulted in a long - lasting effect on AŒ≤ pathology 17 and short - term memory restoration , months after Abs were not detected in the circulation . 18 As AŒ≤ was not targeted by maternal Abs later than 1m of age , two mechanisms could be 19 ruled out : ( a ) maternal Abs interfere with oligomerization and fibrillation , to prevent plaque 20 formation ( Geylis & Steinitz , 2006 ) ; and ( b ) maternal vaccination facilitates AŒ≤ clearance 21 by microglia via opsonization ( Strohmeyer et al . , 2005 ) . This led us to hypothesize that 22 maternal vaccination promoted a long - lasting microglial phagocytic phenotype , 23 14 independently of the presence of anti - AŒ≤ Abs . To verify this , we assessed the expression 1 of various Fc receptors in the brain at 1m following maternal vaccination only , and at 5m 2 of age , following maternal and active vaccination . The activating FcŒ≥RI , FcŒ≥RIII , and 3 FcŒ≥RIV initiate Fc - mediated phagocytosis via several actin - regulating pathways ( Bruhns 4 & Jonsson , 2015 ; Jaumouille et al . , 2014 ) . Additionally , FcR - neonatal ( FcRn ) is crucial for 5 the transport of maternal Abs from the placenta and gut to the circulation of fetuses and 6 newborns ( Latvala , Jacobsen , Otteneder , Herrmann , & Kronenberg , 2017 ) . At 1m , cerebral 7 FcŒ≥RI levels were elevated in maternally vaccinated WT and 5xFAD mice compared with 8 sham - vaccinated controls ( 1 . 56¬±0 . 16 , 1¬±0 . 1 fold - change in WT , 1 . 77¬±0 . 16 , 0 . 86¬±0 . 05 9 fold - change in 5xFAD , P < 0 . 05 , P < 0 . 001 , respectively , Fig . 4A ) . Interestingly , FcŒ≥RIII 10 levels increased in maternally vaccinated 5xFAD mice compared with controls ( 1 . 6¬±0 . 16 , 11 0 . 86¬±0 . 1 fold - change , respectively , P < 0 . 001 , Fig . 5B ) , but not among vaccinated WT mice 12 compared with WT controls ( P = 0 . 12 , Fig . 4B ) . A similar strain - specific effect was also 13 observed for FcŒ≥RIV expression in the brain ( P = 0 . 07 for WT , 2¬±0 . 25 , 0 . 54¬±0 . 045 fold - 14 change , respectively , P < 0 . 0001 for 5xFAD , Fig . 4C ) . FcRn levels were elevated in both 15 WT and 5xFAD mice compared with controls ( 1 . 45¬±0 . 09 , 1¬±0 . 054 fold - change for WT , 16 respectively , P < 0 . 01 , 1 . 54¬±0 . 12 , 1 . 08¬±0 . 07 fold - change , respectively , P < 0 . 01 for 5xFAD , 17 Fig . 4D ) . Interestingly , levels of the inhibitory FcŒ≥RIIb were elevated in vaccinated 5xFAD 18 mice compared with controls ( 1 . 77¬±0 . 33 , 0 . 91¬±0 . 09 , fold - change , P < 0 . 01 , Fig . 4E ) , but 19 not in vaccinated WT mice ( P = 0 . 18 , Fig . 4E ) . These results indicate that the presence of 20 maternal Abs correlated with transcript upregulation of their receptors in the brain . At 5m , 21 FcŒ≥RI levels in M + / A - , M - / A + , and M + / A + mice were elevated compared with M - / A - mice 22 ( 1 . 44¬±0 . 11 , 1 . 39¬±0 . 25 , 1 . 44¬±0 . 2 , 0 . 79¬±0 . 04 fold - change , respectively , P < 0 . 05 , Fig . 4F ) . 23 F c ÔÅß R III r e l a t i ve ex p r ess i on ( no r m a li z e d 2 - ÔÅÑ ÔÅÑ C T ) W T 5x F AD 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 C on t r o l M a t e r na l v a c * * * n . s A C B D F H G I 1M 5M Fc ùõæ RI Fc ùõæ RIII Fc ùõæ RIV FcRn F c ÔÅß R I r e l a t i ve ex p r ess i on ( no r m a li z e d 2 - ÔÅÑ ÔÅÑ C T ) A c t i ve - A c t i ve + 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 M a t e r na l - M a t e r na l + * Fc ùõæ RIIb E J Fc ùõæ RI Fc ùõæ RIII Fc ùõæ RIV FcRn Fc ùõæ RIIb R e l a t i ve ex p r ess i on ( no r m a li z e d 2 - ÔÅÑ ÔÅÑ C T ) W T 5x F AD 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 2 . 5 3 . 0 * * * * R e l a t i ve ex p r ess i on ( no r m a li z e d 2 - ÔÅÑÔÅÑ C T ) W T 5x F AD 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 2 . 5 3 . 0 n . s * * * R e l a t i ve ex p r ess i on ( no r m a li z e d 2 - ÔÅÑÔÅÑ C T ) WT 5xFAD 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 2 . 5 3 . 0 n . s * * * * R e l a t i ve ex p r ess i on ( no r m a li z e d 2 - ÔÅÑÔÅÑ C T ) WT 5xFAD 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 2 . 5 3 . 0 * * * * R e l a t i ve ex p r ess i on ( no r m a li z e d 2 - ÔÅÑÔÅÑ C T ) WT 5xFAD 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 2 . 5 3 . 0 * * n . s R e l a t i ve ex p r ess i on ( no r m a li z e d 2 - ÔÅÑÔÅÑ C T ) Active - Active + 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 2 . 5 3 . 0 * R e l a t i ve ex p r ess i on ( no r m a li z e d 2 - ÔÅÑÔÅÑ C T ) Active - Active + 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 2 . 5 3 . 0 * * R e l a t i ve ex p r ess i on ( no r m a li z e d 2 - ÔÅÑÔÅÑ C T ) Active - Active + 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 2 . 5 3 . 0 R e l a t i ve ex p r ess i on ( no r m a li z e d 2 - ÔÅÑÔÅÑ C T ) Active - Active + 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 2 . 5 3 . 0 * R e l a t i ve ex p r ess i on ( no r m a li z e d 2 - ÔÅÑÔÅÑ C T ) Active - Active + 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 2 . 5 3 . 0 * * * * F c ÔÅß R I r e l a t i ve ex p r e s s i o n ( n o r m a li z e d 2 - ÔÅÑ ÔÅÑ C T ) A c t i ve - A c t i ve + 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 M a t e r na l - M a t e r na l + * Iba1 intensity ( a . u ) F c ÔÅß R I i n t e n s i t y ( a . u ) 0 20 40 60 0 20 40 60 80 Iba1 intensity ( a . u ) F c ÔÅß R I i n t e n s i t y ( a . u ) 0 20 40 60 0 20 40 60 80 Iba1 intensity ( a . u ) F c ÔÅß R I i n t e n s i t y ( a . u ) 0 20 40 60 0 20 40 60 80 I b a1 i n t e n s i t y ( a . u ) F c ÔÅß R I i n t e n s i t y ( a . u ) 0 20 40 60 0 20 40 60 80 I b a1 i n t e n s i t y ( a . u ) F c ÔÅß R I i n t e n s i t y ( a . u ) 0 20 40 60 0 20 40 60 80 M - / A - M - / A + M + / A - M + / A + Iba1 intensity ( a . u ) F c ÔÅß R I i n t e n s i t y ( a . u ) 0 20 40 60 0 20 40 60 80 Iba1 intensity ( a . u ) F c ÔÅß R I i n t e n s i t y ( a . u ) 0 20 40 60 0 20 40 60 80 Iba1 intensity ( a . u ) F c ÔÅß R I i n t e n s i t y ( a . u ) 0 20 40 60 0 20 40 60 80 L M N Fc ÔÅß RI intensity ( a . u ) R e l a t i ve f r e qu e n c y ( f r ac t i on s ) 0 20 40 60 0 . 00 0 . 05 0 . 10 0 . 15 0 . 20 0 . 25 M - / A - M - / A + M + / A - M + / A + * * * * n . s * * * * M - / A - M - / A + M + / A - M + / A + FcŒ≥RI Iba1 DAPI Merge 20¬µm X10 K 200¬µm x63 F c ÔÅß R I i n t e n s i t y ( a . u ) Active - Active + 0 10 20 30 * * * * Fig . 4 Fig . 4 . Maternal vaccination induces long - term FcRs upregulation in the brain . Levels of cerebral FcR mRNA and protein levels of FcŒ≥RI were quantified using RT - qPCR and immunofluorescence following maternal vaccination at 1m of age ( A - E ) and after maternal and active vaccination at 5m of age ( F - N ) . mRNA levels of ( A ) FcŒ≥RI , ( B ) FcŒ≥RIII , ( C ) FcŒ≥RIV , ( D ) FcRn , and ( E ) FcŒ≥RIIb in 1m - old WT and 5xFAD mice .

FcŒ≥RIII mRNA levels were higher in M + / A - and M - / A + mice compared 3 with unvaccinated mice ( 1 . 62¬±0 . 14 , 1 . 67¬±0 . 27 , 0 . 75¬±0 . 02 , respectively , P < 0 . 05 , Fig . 4G ) . 4 However , combined maternal and active vaccination M + / A + did not differ significantly 5 from unvaccinated mice ( 1 . 44¬±0 . 24 , 0 . 75¬±0 . 02 , P = 0 . 07 , Fig . 4G ) . FcŒ≥RIV transcript levels 6 did not differ between groups ( P = 0 . 27 , main effect for maternal vaccination , P = 0 . 47 , main 7 effect for active vaccination , Fig . 4H ) . FcRn levels in M + / A - , M + / A + , and M + / A + mice 8 were elevated compared with M - / A - mice ( 0 . 96¬±0 . 09 , 0 . 91¬±0 . 08 , 0 . 9¬±0 . 11 , 0 . 6¬±0 . 04 fold - 9 change , respectively , P < 0 . 05 , Fig . 4I ) . Levels of inhibitory FcŒ≥RIIb were elevated in 10 M + / A - and M - / A + compared with M - / A - ( 1 . 66¬±0 . 11 , 1 . 89¬±0 . 31 , 0 . 9¬±0 . 06 , fold - change , 11 P < 0 . 05 , P < 0 . 01 , respectively , Fig . 4J ) . Importantly , FcŒ≥RIIb levels were reduced in M + / A + 12 compared with M - / A + mice ( 1 . 09¬±0 . 19 , 1 . 89¬±0 . 31 fold - change , P < 0 . 05 , Fig . 4J ) , 13 suggesting that the combined vaccination results in upregulation of activator FcRs and 14 downregulation of inhibitory FcRs . Finally , elevation in FcŒ≥RI , FcŒ≥RIII and FcRn strongly 15 correlated with AŒ≤ reduction ( full data are described in the supplementary text , Fig . S5 ) . 16 17 Maternal vaccination elevates FcŒ≥RI on microglial cells . As FcŒ≥R signaling could 18 mediate the effects of maternal vaccination on AŒ≤ pathology , we next assessed FcŒ≥RI , 19 FcŒ≥RIIb , FcŒ≥RIII , and FcŒ≥RIV expression in CNS cells . FcŒ≥RI was abundantly expressed 20 in microglia , but not in neurons or astrocytes ( full data are described in the supplementary 21 text , Fig . S6 - 7 ) . Consequently , we next assessed FcŒ≥RI levels in microglial cells in the 22 hippocampus and cortex of maternally and actively immunized mice . At 5m , hippocampal 23 16 FcŒ≥RI levels were elevated in M + / A - and M + / A + microglia compared with both M - / A - 1 and M - / A + ( 15 . 41¬± 6 . 58 , 15 . 86¬±2 . 8 , 8 . 9¬±2 . 8 , 7 . 4¬±2 . 8 a . u ( arbitrary unit ) , P < 0 . 01 , Fig . 4K - 2 L ) . Active vaccination alone did not yield such elevation compared with M - / A - ( P = 0 . 84 , 3 Fig . 4K - L ) . FcŒ≥RI expression was normally distributed in M + / A + microglia ( P = 0 . 7 4 compared with simulated normal distribution of the same mean and standard deviation , 5 Fig . 4M ) and close to normal distribution in M + / A - ( P = 0 . 04 , Fig . 4M ) . In M - / A - and M - 6 / A + , FcŒ≥RI distribution was skewed to the right and significantly differed from simulated 7 normal distribution ( P < 0 . 0001 , Fig . 4M ) . FcŒ≥RI distribution in M + / A - and M + / A + 8 hippocampal microglia differed from M - / A - and M - / A + ( P < 0 . 0001 , Fig . 4N ) , with no 9 difference between M + / A - and M + / A + mice , suggesting no additive effect of active 10 vaccination on already maternally immunized animals . Similar effects were found in 11 cortical microglia , as FcŒ≥RI levels were elevated in maternally vaccinated mice M + / A - and 12 M + / A + compared with controls ( full data are described in the supplementary text , Fig . S8 ) . 13 14 Maternal vaccination activates phagocytosis - related signaling cascades in microglial 15 cells . Maternal vaccination upregulated FcŒ≥RI , FcŒ≥RIII , FcŒ≥RIV , and FcRn transcripts ( Fig . 16 4A - J ) and increased the microglial FcŒ≥RI protein expression ( Fig . 4K - N ) . Clustering of 17 FcŒ≥Rs induces activation of Src - related kinases that phosphorylate the immunoreceptor 18 tyrosine - based activation motif ( ITAM ) domain on FcŒ≥Rs . Syk is recruited to the receptor 19 and undergoes autophosphorylation . This in turn activates downstream signaling 20 molecules , such as AKT , ERK , and cofilin , all involved in actin - cytoskeleton regulation 21 and are essential for phagocytosis ( Kiefer et al . , 1998 ) . 22 17 At 5m of age , pSyk was upregulated in the hippocampus of M + / A - and M + / A + compared 1 with M - / A - and M - / A + mice ( 0 . 68¬±0 . 13 , 0 . 7¬±0 . 16 , 0 . 23¬±0 . 07 , 0 . 44¬±0 . 14 , a . u , respectively , 2 P < 0 . 05 , Fig . 5A - B ) . Similarly , total Syk was also upregulated in maternally vaccinated 3 mice ( 0 . 6¬±0 . 05 , 0 . 54¬±0 . 05 , 0 . 21¬±0 . 02 , 0 . 29¬±0 . 05 , a . u , respectively , P < 0 . 001 , Fig . 5A - B ) , 4 suggesting that FcŒ≥R upregulation by maternal vaccination resulted in activation of 5 downstream Syk signaling . pAKT levels were elevated as a result of active vaccination in 6 M - / A + and M + / A + compared with M - / A - and M + / A - , with no effect of maternal 7 vaccination ( 1 . 64¬±0 . 12 , 1 . 37¬±0 . 12 , 1¬±0 . 13 , 1 . 13¬±0 . 13 , a . u respectively , P < 0 . 01 , Fig . 5A , 8 C ) . Total AKT levels did not differ between groups ( P = 0 . 9 , main effect for active 9 vaccination , 0 . 76 , main effect for maternal vaccination , Fig . 5A , C ) . In a similar manner , 10 pERK levels increased in actively vaccinated mice M - / A + and M + / A + compared with M - 11 / A - and M + / A - , with little contribution of maternal vaccination ( 0 . 95¬±0 . 13 , 0 . 93¬±0 . 1 , 12 0 . 62¬±0 . 11 , 0 . 72¬±0 . 1 au , respectively , P < 0 . 05 , Fig . 5A , D ) . Total ERK levels did not differ 13 between groups ( P = 0 . 98 , main effect for active vaccination , 0 . 54 , main effect for maternal 14 vaccination , Fig . 5A , D ) . This may serve as evidence for Syk activation of ERK and AKT - 15 mediated actin regulation as a result of active , but not maternal , vaccination . pCofilin levels 16 increased in maternally immunized mice M + / A - , compared with unvaccinated mice M - / A - 17 ( 0 . 76¬±0 . 2 , 0 . 29¬±0 . 07 a . u , respectively , P < 0 . 05 , Fig . 5A , E ) . No difference was observed 18 between actively M - / A + and combined M + / A + vaccination ( P = 0 . 87 , Fig . 5A , E ) . 19 Moreover , maternal vaccination alone yielded similar pCofilin levels as did active 20 vaccination or combined vaccine . Levels of cofilin were reduced in actively M - / A + and 21 combined M + / A + mice compared with unvaccinated M - / A - and maternally vaccinated M - 22 / A + mice ( 0 . 59¬±0 . 07 , 0 . 62¬±0 . 15 , 1 . 02¬±0 . 1 , 0 . 93¬±0 . 16 au , respectively , P < 0 . 05 , Fig . 5A , 23 WT 5XFAD - - Maternal Active - - - + + - + + 60 60 44 / 42 19 19 50 43 72 72 44 / 42 kDa pAKT AKT pERK pCofilin Cofilin Œ≤ - Tub Œ≤ - Actin pSyk Syk ERK A B C D E F p E RK E RK p E RK / E RK 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 E RK S i gn a l i n t e n s i t y ( a . u ) M - / A - M - / A + M + / A - M + / A + * n . s * pSyk Syk pSyk / Syk 0 1 2 3 4 S yk S i gn a l i n t e n s i t y ( N o r m a li z e d a . u ) * * * * p AK T AK T p AK T / AK T 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 2 . 5 AK T S i gn a l i n t e n s i t y ( N o r m a li z e d a . u ) * * n . s * p E RK E RK p E RK / E RK 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 E RK S i gn a l i n t e n s i t y ( N o r m a li z e d a . u ) * n . s * p C o f ili n C o f ili n p C o f ili n / C o f ili n 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 2 . 53 . 54 . 0 C o f ili n S i gn a l i n t e n s i t y ( N o r m a li z e d a . u ) * * * * * * 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 1 . 2 A c t i n S i gn a l i n t e n s i t y ( N o r m a li z e d a . u ) * * Fig . 5 F c ÔÅß R I r e l a t i v e ex p r e ss i o n ( n o r m a l i z e d 2 - ÔÅÑ ÔÅÑ C T ) Ac tiv e - Ac tiv e + 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 M a te rn a l - M a te rn a l + * G H I Active - Active + 0 10 20 30 40 50 C D 6 8 s i gn a l i n t e n s i t y ( a . u . ) * * * * * M - / A - M - / A + M + / A - M + / A + CD68 Iba1 DAPI Merge X10 200¬µm 20¬µm x63 C D 6 8 r e l a t i ve e x p r ess i on ( no r m a li z e d 2 - ÔÅÑÔÅÑ C T ) Active - Active + 0 1 2 3 4 5 * * * * Fig 5 . Maternal vaccination activates FcR - mediated phagocytosis via activation of AKT , ERK , and Cofilin actin - cytoskeleton regulation pathways . Level of Syk and downstream signaling molecules from the Fc - mediated phagocytosis pathway were measured using immunoblotting following maternal vaccination and active vaccination at 5m of age . Functionally , Fc - mediate Phagocytosis and hippocampal microglial reactivity were assessed using double labeling of CD68 and Iba1 + microglia .

This may serve as evidence that maternal vaccination enhances actin polymerization 1 via Syk - mediated elevation in pCofilin levels and reduction in Cofilin levels . Finally , we 2 found that both maternal M + / A - , M + / A + , and active M - / A + vaccination reduce actin levels 3 compared with unvaccinated M - / A - mice ( 0 . 73¬±0 . 05 , 0 . 7¬±0 . 03 , 0 . 71¬±0 . 03 , 0 . 89¬±0 . 04 , a . u , 4 respectively , P < 0 . 05 , Fig . 5A , F ) . These findings provide evidence for the long - term effect 5 of maternal vaccination in facilitating FcR - mediated phagocytosis signaling pathways ( Fig . 6 S9A ) . 7 8 Maternal vaccination facilitates long - term AŒ≤ clearance via enhancing FcR - mediated 9 microglial phagocytosis . FcR upregulation led to recruitment and activation of Syk , which 10 in turn initiated an actin regulating pathway via AKT , ERK , and Cofilin . Regulation of 11 actin polymerization and depolymerization is essential for the construction of the 12 phagosome ( Jaumouille et al . , 2014 ) . CD68 , a lysosomal protein expressed in macrophages 13 and activated microglia , is often associated with pro - inflammatory disease - associated 14 microglia . To assess whether maternally and actively vaccinated mice exhibit elevated 15 phagocytic behavior , immunohistochemical ( IHC ) analysis of CD68 among Iba1 + cells was 16 conducted . Maternally vaccinated mice M + / A - exhibit elevated CD68 levels in Iba1 + cells , 17 compared with M - / A - ( 32 . 2¬±1 . 4 , 26 . 98¬±1 . 07 a . u , respectively , P < 0 . 05 , Fig . 5G - H ) . 18 Moreover , M - / A + and M + / A + mice exhibit higher CD68 expression than M - / A - and 19 M + / A - mice ( 43 . 9¬±0 . 6 , 43 . 09¬±1 . 4 a . u , respectively , P < 0 . 0001 , Fig . 5G - H ) , with no 20 difference between M - / A + and M + / A + ( P = 0 . 75 , Fig . 5G - H ) . These findings suggest that 21 maternal vaccination alone enhances microglial phagocytosis . At the transcript level , 22 M + / A - mice exhibit elevated levels of CD68 mRNA compared with M - / A - ( 3 . 05¬±0 . 34 , 23 19 1 . 19¬±0 . 09 fold - change , respectively , P < 0 . 001 , Fig . 5I ) , suggesting that maternal 1 vaccination support microglial phagocytosis even in the absence of Abs , possibly via FcR - 2 Syk activation . Additionally , actively vaccinated M - / A + and combined M + / A + vaccination 3 mice also exhibited elevated transcript levels of CD68 compared with unvaccinated 4 controls ( 2 . 16¬±0 . 3 , 2 . 19¬±0 . 3 fold - change , respectively , P < 0 . 05 , Fig . 5I ) . This data imply 5 that microglial phagocytosis is enhanced in maternally and actively vaccinated mice . To 6 support the maternal vaccination / FcR / Syk / phagocytosis hypothesis , we stained 7 hippocampal CD68 + cells for pSyk . Maternally vaccinated M + / A - mice exhibited elevated 8 pSyk levels among CD68 + cells in the hippocampus , compared with M - / A - mice 9 ( 18 . 68¬±0 . 51 , 16 . 57¬±0 . 52 a . u , respectively , P < 0 . 05 , Fig . S10A - B ) , suggesting that maternal 10 vaccination alone is sufficient in inducing Syk activation in microglial cells , long after 11 maternally - induced Abs are abolished . Additionally , maternally and actively M + / A + mice 12 exhibited elevated microglial pSyk levels compared with actively M - / A + immunized mice 13 ( 18 . 87¬±0 . 37 , 14 . 09¬±0 . 39 a . u , respectively , P < 0 . 0001 , Fig . S10A - B ) , suggesting that active 14 vaccination alone does not not induce Syk activation as strongly as maternal vaccination . 15 16 Maternal antibodies facilitate AŒ≤ clearance by microglial cells in a Syk - dependent 17 manner . We next assessed the effect of maternal antibodies on Syk - dependent phagocytic 18 capacity of N9 murine embryonic microglial cell - line ( Corradin , Mauel , Donini , 19 Quattrocchi , & Ricciardi - Castagnoli , 1993 ) and adult primary microglia . Increasing 20 concentration ( 0 . 75 - 5¬µM ) of BAY - 61 - 3606 ( BAY ) , a highly selective Syk inhibitor 21 ( Yamamoto et al . , 2003 ) , in the media of N9 cells decreased AŒ≤ - induced Syk 22 phosphorylation in a dose - dependent manner ( Fig . 6A ) .

Maternal antibodies mediate AŒ≤ phagocytosis in N9 microglial cell - line and primary adult microglia in a Syk - dependent manner . Phagocytosis capacity of N9 murine embryonic cell - line and adult primary microglia , as well as intracellular signaling , were assessed following treatment with either AŒ≤ 42 alone or AŒ≤ 42 pre - incubated with serum from anti - AŒ≤ or sham - vaccinated dams . The contribution of Syk signaling was assessed using Syk inhibition by BAY - 61 - 3606 . ( A ) BAY inhibits Syk phosphorylation in a dose - dependent manner . ( B - D ) Phagocytosis of FBS - coated fluorescent beads by N9 cells is reduced following treatment with Syk inhibitor . ( E - F ) IF of N9 cells following incubation with AŒ≤ reveals a reduction in phagocytosis capacity after Syk inhibition . ( G - J ) Serum from anti - AŒ≤ vaccinated dams increases phagocytosis by N9 cells compared with serum from sham - vaccinated dams and abrogation of this effect following Syk inhibition . ( K ) Treatment with AŒ≤ , serum from anti - AŒ≤ or sham - vaccinated dams , or combined treatment reveals differences in the time - course of Syk phosphorylation . ( L - M ) Phagocytosis assay of AŒ≤ by adult primary microglia reveals that serum from anti - AŒ≤ vaccinated dams facilitates AŒ≤ clearance in a Syk - dependent pathway . * * P < 0 . 01 , * * * P < 0 . 001 , * * * * P < 0 . 0001 , unpaired t - test , Chi - squared test for independence , Fisher‚Äôs exact test , one - way ANOVA . 20 downstream signaling molecules of the Fc - mediate phagocytosis pathway was observed , 1 namely , reduction in ERK and AKT phosphorylation and an increase in cofilin 2 phosphorylation ( Supplementary Fig . S11A - C ) . As activation of ERK and AKT exhibited 3 a considerable reduction in cells incubated with 5¬µM of BAY , the following experiments 4 were conducted using this concentration . We first assessed the general capacity of N9 cells 5 to perform phagocytosis of FBS - coated fluorescent beads following a 3h FBS deprivation . 6 N9 cells treated with BAY exhibited reduced phagocytic activity compared with controls 7 ( 8 . 92¬±0 . 16 , 23 . 97¬±1 . 12 percentage of FITC + cells , respectively , P < 0 . 001 , Fig . 6B - C ) and 8 a reduction in FITC intensity ( 8958¬±156 . 42 , 9535¬±326 . 64 , mean FITC intensity , a . u , 9 respectively , P < 0 . 05 , Fig . 6D ) , reflecting not only a lower percentage of phagocytic cells , 10 but also a lower number of intracellular beads . Importantly , Syk inhibition reduced 11 phagocytosis of AŒ≤ 42 peptide , as the number of AŒ≤ foci per mm 2 was reduced by ~ 50 % 12 following BAY administration compared to control ( 48 . 32¬±4 . 18 , 96 . 38¬±6 . 71 AŒ≤ foci per 13 mm 2 , respectively , P < 0 . 0001 , Fig . 6E - F ) . Next , we tested whether pre - incubation of AŒ≤ 14 with serum from anti - AŒ≤ vaccinated dams facilitates phagocytosis of Ab - Ag complexes . 15 N9 cells were treated with AŒ≤ 42 alone , AŒ≤ 42 pre - incubated with serum from sham , or anti - 16 AŒ≤ vaccinated dams with BAY . 5 . 1 % of untreated N9 cells were AŒ≤ positive , 17 demonstrating baseline phagocytosis capacity of these cells ( Fig . 6G - H ) . Incubation with 18 serum from sham - vaccinated resulted in 11 . 7¬±0 . 03 % and of phagocytic cells ( P < 0 . 0001 19 compared to baseline , Fig . 6G - H ) , and incubation with serum from anti - AŒ≤ vaccinated 20 dams elicited phagocytosis in 81¬±0 . 003 % of the cells ( P < 0 . 0001 compared with baseline 21 and sham - vaccinated serum , Fig . 6G - H ) . Importantly , this drastic effect was abrogated by 22 Syk inhibition , as only 18 . 3¬±0 . 003 % of BAY and serum - treated cells were phagocytic 23 21 ( P < 0 . 0001 , Fig . 6G - H ) . The median of FITC intensity increased among cells treated with 1 anti - AŒ≤ serum compared with sham - vaccinated serum ( 316¬±96 . 1 , 168¬±30 . 4 a . u , 2 respectively , P < 0 . 0001 , Fig . 6I - J ) and reduced following treatment with BAY ( 183¬±30 . 7 3 a . u , P < 0 . 0001 , Fig . 6I - J ) . These results demonstrate that maternal antibodies facilitate Fc - 4 receptor mediated AŒ≤ phagocytosis in a Syk - dependent pathway . To further understand the 5 alteration in cellular signaling following serum and AŒ≤ administration , Syk 6 phosphorylation was measured using western blotting 10 - 30min after treatment with either 7 AŒ≤ 42 alone , serum from anti - AŒ≤ vaccinated dams , or AŒ≤ 42 pre - incubated with serum from 8 vaccinated and sham - vaccinated dams ( Fig . 6K ) . AŒ≤ alone elicited elevation in Syk 9 activation ( 3 . 75 - fold change of na√Øve cells after 20min , Fig . 6K ) . Serum from anti - AŒ≤ 10 vaccinated dams alone also resulted in Syk activation ( 4 . 06 - fold change of na√Øve cells after 11 10min , Fig . 6K ) . The difference in Syk activation timing implies that AŒ≤ and antibodies 12 alone may activate different signaling pathways , e . g . Fc - receptor signaling by antibodies 13 and Trem2 signaling by AŒ≤ , both of which are Syk - dependent . Interestingly , serum from 14 sham - vaccinated dams elicited a milder activation of Syk ( 1 . 92 - fold change of na√Øve cells 15 after 10min , Fig . 6K ) , supporting our hypothesis that Syk phosphorylation associated with 16 Fc - receptors peaks 10min following treatment . Treatment with both AŒ≤ and serum from 17 vaccinated dams yielded a strong but transient Syk activation ( 4 . 16 - fold change of na√Øve 18 cells after 20min , Fig . 6K ) , suggesting that Ab - Ag complexes generate a somewhat 19 different effect than Ab or Ag alone . 20 To further examine the contribution of maternal antibodies to Fc - receptor Syk - mediated 21 AŒ≤ clearance by microglia , phagocytosis assay was conducted using adult primary 22 microglia from na√Øve WT mice . Cells were administered with AŒ≤ 42 ( 750 nM ) following 23 22 incubation with serum from sham - vaccinated dams , anti - AŒ≤ vaccinated dams , and Syk 1 inhibitor BAY . 4h following AŒ≤ administration , primary microglial cells were fixed and 2 stained for CD68 and intracellular AŒ≤ . Treatment with serum from sham - vaccinated 3 females did not increase AŒ≤ phagocytosis compared with untreated cells ( 0 . 27¬±0 . 07 , 4 0 . 25¬±0 . 07 , a fraction of AŒ≤ + cells , respectively , P = 0 . 37 , Fig . 6L ) . In contrast , treatment 5 with anti - AŒ≤ serum increased phagocytic activity compared with both untreated and sham - 6 vaccinated serum treatment ( 0 . 45¬±0 . 08 fraction of AŒ≤ + cells , P < 0 . 001 , Fig . 6L ) . 7 Importantly , this effect was abrogated by Syk inhibition ( 0 . 31¬±0 . 07 fraction of AŒ≤ + cells , 8 P < 0 . 01 , Fig . 6L ) , demonstrating that AŒ≤ clearance facilitated by antibodies is a Syk - 9 dependent process . 10 11 Discussion 12 To date , there is no effective therapy for AD - related dementia in individuals with DS . 13 Considering the positive outcomes of active vaccination in Ts65Dn mouse model of DS 14 ( Illouz et al . , 2019 ) and the rapid propagation of cerebral AŒ≤ in DS , maternal vaccination 15 may serve as early , preventative intervention , well before the formation of AŒ≤ plaques . So 16 far , anti - AŒ≤ vaccination targeting dementia in AD patients has failed to translate to the 17 clinic . However , the age of intervention in relation to the onset of the disease and to the 18 subjects‚Äô immunological age might be held responsible ( Miller , 2012 ; Morris et al . , 2012 ; 19 Reiman et al . , 2011 ) . The DS case is therefore quite different in this manner . DS can be 20 detectable in utero , and the progression of AŒ≤ pathology is earlier and faster than in late - 21 onset AD . We thus propose that early anti - AŒ≤ intervention in the form of maternally 22 23 transferred Abs , along with active postnatal vaccination , may provide continuous immune 1 targeting of AŒ≤ in individuals with DS . 2 In this study , we vaccinated WT females prior to their pregnancy with transgenic 3 embryos , as the duration of mature IgG production exceeds the length of pregnancy in 4 mice . In humans , a full humoral response can be achieved during pregnancy . In contrast to 5 the full AŒ≤ 42 , using the 1 - 11 fragment of AŒ≤ , which does not contain cytotoxic T - cell 6 epitopes , reduces the risk of a hazardous response ( Olkhanud et al . , 2012 ) . Moreover , WT 7 mice that received anti - AŒ≤ 1 - 11 vaccine did not exhibit any behavioral or cognitive decline , 8 or neuronal loss , or inflammatory response compared with controls ( Illouz et al . , 2019 ) . To 9 date , more than 50 clinical trials have been conducted using DNA delivery by 10 electroporation , reporting enhancement of DNA immunogenicity in humans and 11 tolerability by patients without causing negative side effects ( Rosenberg , Fu , & Lambracht - 12 Washington , 2018 ) . 13 The transfer of IgG2b Abs from dams to pups is supported by elevation of FcRn expression , 14 which facilitates the passage of maternal Abs through the placenta and the crossing of 15 maternal Abs from the gut of newborns into the circulation ( Latvala et al . , 2017 ) . 16 Moreover , FcRn plays a role in elongating IgG half - live as it restores opsonized IgG and 17 prevents its degradation . Maternal vaccination thus initiates a positive regulation loop in 18 which the presence of maternal Abs elevates the transcription of FcRn , which in turn 19 supports the passage of these Abs through the placenta and lactation and elongates their 20 half - live and functionality . Among the maternal Ab milieu , IgG2b was the most common 21 isotype that crossed the placenta . IgG2b and IgM were the most common isotypes delivered 22 through lactation . Since IgM cannot cross the blood - brain barrier ( BBB ) ( Nilaratanakul et 23 24 al . , 2018 ) , IgG2b is the main candidate effector for any downstream immunomodulation 1 inside the CNS . Accordingly , we found elevated levels of FcŒ≥RI and FcŒ≥RIII , which bind 2 IgG2b ( Bruhns & Jonsson , 2015 ) , but no expression of cerebral FcŒ± / ŒºR that binds IgA and 3 IgM , respectively . The positive correlation between maternal and newborns IgG2b levels 4 along with the negative correlation between IgG2b levels in newborns and their AŒ≤ levels 5 at 5m strongly support this suggestion . Indeed , we found that high maternal IgM levels in 6 newborns were correlated with low AŒ≤ pathology at 5m . The contribution of IgM , if exists , 7 is thus attributed to peripheral rather than CNS immunomodulation . Following active 8 vaccination , IgG2b was the only isotype to remain high three months after the last boost . 9 Taken together , IgG2b remains the main effector of both maternal and active vaccination . 10 We hypothesized that a combination of maternal and active vaccination would yield 11 continuous protection from AŒ≤ neurotoxicity . Indeed , this combination resulted in 12 normalization of exploratory behavior and restoration of short - term memory capacity . 13 Maternal vaccination alone had no effect on exploratory behavior and only a partially 14 positive effect on short - term memory . In contrast , active vaccination yielded a full rescue 15 of short - term memory ability . Reduction in AŒ≤ levels , however , was strongly dependent 16 on maternal vaccination . Active vaccination produced a minor reduction in insoluble AŒ≤ 17 levels , whereas maternal vaccination , with or without the addition of active vaccination , 18 greatly reduced levels of this fraction . Moreover , the newborn serum concentration of 19 maternal Abs was significantly more predictive of AŒ≤ clearance than actively - induced - Abs 20 in young adults . Taken together , the cognitive and neuropathological findings indicate that 21 the combination of maternal and active vaccination produced the most potent therapeutic 22 effect . 23 25 Maternally induced Abs were present in the circulating blood of offspring for the short and 1 limited period of pregnancy and lactation . Following weaning , these Abs were no longer 2 detectable . However , four months after Abs were absent , AŒ≤ levels were dramatically 3 reduced , indicating a long - lasting immunomodulatory effect on microglial cells . Maternal 4 vaccination indeed increased the expression of effector FcŒ≥R s and FcRn in the brain . 5 Importantly , the expression levels of Fc receptors negatively correlated with insoluble AŒ≤ 6 levels . Fc receptors , expressed on various immune cells , constitute critical elements for 7 activating or downregulating immune responses ( Takai , 2005 ) . Our data imply that an 8 increase in FcR ligands upregulates the expression of FcŒ≥RI , FcŒ≥RIII , and FcŒ≥RIV at the 9 transcript level in the brain , and FcŒ≥RI at the protein level in microglial cells . The effector 10 FcŒ≥RI contains an intracellular immunoreceptor tyrosine - based activation motif ITAM 11 domain , which mediates cellular activation triggered by Ab - receptor binding ( Takai , 12 2005 ) . Clustering of FcŒ≥Rs induces activation of Src family kinases that phosphorylates 13 the ITAM domain within the receptor . When an effector FcR is activated , Syk is recruited 14 to the receptor and undergoes autophosphorylation , resulting in activation of downstream 15 signaling molecules , such as AKT , ERK , and cofilin , all involved in actin - cytoskeleton 16 regulation and are essential for phagocytosis ( Kiefer et al . , 1998 ) . The FcŒ≥Rs - Syk pathway 17 is heavily implicated in phagocytosis ( Song , Tanaka , Cox , & Lee , 2004 ; Stangel & 18 Compston , 2001 ) , a central function of microglial cells in the context of targeting amyloid 19 burden ( Krasemann et al . , 2017 ) . Indeed , we found that Syk was activated in maternally 20 vaccinated mice . Accordingly , levels of phospho - cofilin were increased , and levels of 21 cofilin decreased . The actin - depolymerizing factor ( ADF ) / cofilin protein family consists 22 of small actin - binding proteins that play central roles in accelerating actin turnover by 23 26 disassembling actin filaments ( Tanaka et al . , 2018 ) . The activity of cofilin is regulated by 1 phosphorylation on residue Ser3 by LIM kinases ( LIMK1 and LIMK2 ) and TES kinases 2 ( TESK1 and TESK2 ) , which inhibit its interaction with actin ( Kanellos & Frame , 2016 ) . 3 Thus , maternal vaccination - induced FcR - Syk mediated cofilin phosphorylation contributes 4 to the inactivation of cofilin and promotes actin polymerization , which is essential for 5 phagosome formation in microglia ( Jaumouille et al . , 2014 ) . ERK and AKT activation is 6 also implicated in Fc - mediated phagocytosis , as both molecules undergo phosphorylation 7 under Syk activation . Inhibition of Src and Syk kinases suppresses phagocytosis in primary 8 human microglia with suppression of ERK and AKT activity ( Song et al . , 2004 ) . 9 Following the onset of AŒ≤ propagation , activation of ERK and AKT increased in actively , 10 but not maternally , vaccinated mice . 11 CD68 is a heavily glycosylated type I trans - membrane glycoprotein , mainly associated 12 with endosomal / lysosomal compartments ( Chistiakov , Killingsworth , Myasoedova , 13 Orekhov , & Bobryshev , 2017 ) . In the brain , it is highly expressed among phagocytic 14 microglia ( Fu , Shen , Xu , Luo , & Tang , 2014 ) . In accordance with previous results , 15 maternally vaccinated mice express higher levels of microglial CD68 , suggesting enhanced 16 phagocytic activity . 17 In line with these data , we found that N9 and primary microglia phagocytosis of AŒ≤ is 18 dramatically increased in the presence of anti - AŒ≤ antibodies obtained from vaccinated 19 dams . This effect is antibody - specific , as serum from sham - vaccinated dams ( containing 20 high titers of anti - HBSAg Abs ) did not yield an equivalent increase . Importantly , antibody - 21 mediated phagocytosis is a Syk - dependent process , as inhibition of Syk abrogated 22 phagocytic increases by antibodies in both N9 and primary cells . Taken together , the 23 27 association of AŒ≤ clearance with microglial Syk activation maternal vaccination in vivo 1 and the establishment of causal relations between maternal antibodies and phagocytosis 2 capacity in vitro serve as evidence for the modulatory effect of maternal antibodies on 3 microglial cellular function in eliminating AŒ≤ from the brain parenchyma . 4 Taken together , we propose that during a short and limited period , maternal vaccination 5 had set the infrastructure for facilitating future phagocytosis and clearance of AŒ≤ by 6 microglia . Such infrastructure consists of upregulation of effector FcŒ≥R in the brain . This 7 Abs - induced process is supported by a positive regulation loop of Abs - FcRn that facilitates 8 Ab delivery via the placenta and lactation and increases Abs functionality . Upon AŒ≤ - 9 expression , this infrastructure facilitates Fc - mediated phagocytosis and AŒ≤ clearance , 10 without the addition of active vaccination . 11 12 Conclusion 13 In this study , we tested the efficacy of maternal vaccination in reducing AŒ≤ - related 14 neuropathology and cognitive decline . We found that maternal vaccination reduced 15 dramatically AŒ≤ pathology independently of active vaccination , in a long - lasting manner , 16 months after maternal Abs were undetectable . A combination of maternal and active 17 vaccination yielded the most potent results in ameliorating cognitive decline . 18 Mechanistically , we propose that maternal vaccination activates the FcR - Syk - Cofilin axis , 19 resulting in actin regulation and promotion of AŒ≤ clearance by microglial cells . In - vitro 20 phagocytosis was indeed facilitated by maternal antibodies , via Syk - dependent pathways . 21 Maternal vaccination may thus provide a novel therapeutic approach for preventing early 22 AŒ≤ accumulation and dementia in DS individuals . 23 28 Materials and Methods 1 Study design . 8 - week old C57BL6 WT female mice ( n = 12 / group ) were actively 2 vaccinated using the AŒ≤CoreS DNA - vaccine ( Fig . 1A ) . Females were then crossed with 3 5xFAD males . IgG transfer via the placenta and lactation was assessed in one cohort 4 ( n = 8 / group ) , while long - term effects of maternal and active vaccination were tested in a 5 second cohort ( n = 5 / group ) . At 1m , active vaccination against AŒ≤ or sham was administered 6 to maternally or sham vaccinated offspring , to yield four experimental groups : sham - 7 vaccinated M - / A - , maternally vaccinated M + / A - , actively vaccinated M - / A + , and 8 combined maternal and actively vaccinated mice M + / A + . Sham - vaccinated WT mice were 9 used as healthy controls . 10 11 Animals . The 5xFAD EOAD mouse model ( Jackson Laboratories # 34840 ) , which 12 encompasses five AD - related mutations within the APP and PSE1 genes ( Oakley et al . , 13 2006 ) , was used in this study to model early AŒ≤ accumulation in DS . 5xFAD mice were 14 generously provided by Michal Schwartz ( The Weizmann Institute , Rehovot , Israel ) . 15 C57BL mice were used as dams and healthy controls ( Jackson Laboratories # 000664 , Bar 16 Harbor , ME ) . Animal care and experimental procedures followed the NIH Guide for the 17 Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and Bar - Ilan and were approved by the Bar - Ilan 18 University Animal Care and Use Committee . 19 20 AŒ≤CoreS vaccine . AŒ≤CoreS is based on the pVAX1 expression vector ( Olkhanud et al . , 21 2012 ) and encodes the N - terminus - AŒ≤ 1 - 11 fused to a Hepatitis - B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) 22 and the Hepatitis - B core antigen ( HBcAg ) , which acts to facilitate Ab production ( Pyrski 23 29 et al . , 2017 ) . As a control treatment , an expression vector ( pUC19 , New England Biolabs ) 1 containing HBsAg was used . 2 3 Vaccine administration . Mice were intramuscularly injected at three time - points ( 14 - day 4 intervals ) , with 25¬µg DNA ( 50¬µl ) , as previously described ( Olkhanud et al . , 2012 ) . Full 5 electroporation configurations are detailed in the Supplementary Materials section . 6 7 Antibody titer . Anti - AŒ≤1 - 11 Ab serum levels were quantified using a standard indirect 8 ELISA against recombinant AŒ≤1 - 11 peptide . A detailed protocol is found in the 9 Supplementary Materials section . 10 11 Exploratory behavior . Exploratory behavior was recorded using a 40x40cm open field 12 ( OF ) arena . The outer 8cm were defined as the area periphery and the 24x24cm inner 13 square as the center . Illumination was kept at 1300lux . Mice were allowed to freely explore 14 the arena for 5min ( Seibenhener & Wooten , 2015 ) . Analysis of animal behavior in this 15 task , as well as the following tasks , was conducted using Anymaze ( Stoelting ) . 16 17 Anxiety assessment . Anxiety - related behavior was monitored using the elevated zero 18 maze ( EZM ) , a ring - shaped 65cm - high table , divided into closed and opened sections . The 19 ring is 7cm wide and has an outer diameter of 60cm . The closed sections are confined by 20 20cm - high walls and a semi - transparent ceiling , whereas the opened sections have a 0 . 5cm 21 high curbs at the edges . Illumination was kept at 1300lux , and trial duration was 5 minutes 22 ( Shepherd et al . , 1994 ) . 23 30 1 Short - term object recognition memory . Short - term memory was assessed using the 2 novel object recognition ( NOR ) test as previously described ( Leger et al . , 2013 ; Lueptow , 3 2017 ) . Briefly , mice were placed in a 40x40cm arena with two different objects . In an 4 acquisition trial , mice were allowed to explore their environment . In the following test trial , 5 one of the objects was replaced by a novel object . Time spent near each of the objects was 6 measured , and a preference index was calculated as the difference between time spent in 7 the novel and familiar objects , divided by the total time spent near both objects . 8 Spatial short - term memory . We utilized a variant of the T - maze alternation test , as 9 previously described ( Deacon & Rawlins , 2006 ) . Full apparatus settings are found in the 10 supplementary materials section . 11 12 Brain Sample collection . Mice were anesthetized using Ketamine - Xylazine ( 100mg / kg , 13 Vetoquinol , France , 10mg / kg , Eurovet , The Netherlands , respectively ) and perfused with 14 PBS . For Histology , hemibrains were transferred to 4 % paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) at 4 ¬∞ C 15 for 48h . Following fixation , tissues were transferred to a gradient of 20 % and 30 % sucrose 16 aqueous solutions for 24h each . Hemibrains were then dissected into 40Œºm - thick slices 17 using a microtome and stored in a cryoprotectant solution ( 30 % glycerol and 35 % ethylene 18 glycol ) at - 20 ¬∞ C . For biochemical analysis , the cerebral cortex and hippocampi were 19 separated , frozen on dry ice , and stored at ‚àí80 ¬∞ C . 20 21 31 Measuring AŒ≤ 40 / 42 levels using sELISA . A Œ≤ 40 and A Œ≤ 42 in the cortex were measured using 1 a modification of a previously published sandwich - ELISA protocol ( Illouz et al . , 2017 ) . 2 The full protocol is found in the Supplementary Materials section . 3 4 Immunofluorescence . 40Œºm - thick hemibrains were rinsed 5 times in 0 . 1 % PBS - Triton for 5 5min . Nonspecific bindings were blocked using 20 % normal horse serum in PBS - T for 1h 6 at RT . For AŒ≤ staining , antigen retrieval was conducted using incubation with 75 % formic 7 acid for 2min at RT . For pSyk , antigen retrieval was conducted using sodium citrate buffer 8 ( pH = 6 ) for 20min at 95¬∞C . Primary Abs for the following antigen were applied and 9 incubated overnight at 4¬∞C : AŒ≤ 42 , Iba1 , NeuN , GFAP , FcŒ≥RI , FcŒ≥RIIb , FcŒ≥RIII , FcŒ≥RIV , 10 CD68 , and pSyk . Next , sections were rinsed five times in PBS - T for 5min , and 11 fluorescence - tagged secondary Abs were applied for 1h at RT . Primary and secondary Ab 12 details are found in Supplementary Table 1 . Slices were then stained with Hoechst 33342 13 ( H3570 , Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) and diluted at 1 : 1 , 000 , followed by five 5 - minute rinses 14 with PBS - T . 15 16 AŒ≤ Plaque quantification . Cerebral AŒ≤ plaques were quantified computationally using 17 blob detection tools in MATLAB ( MathWorks , Natick , MA ) . Briefly , montage 18 immunofluorescence images of the hippocampus and cortex were obtained using the X10 19 objective of a Leica DM6000 microscope ( Leica Microsystems , Wetzlar , Germany ) , 20 coupled to a controller module and a high sensitivity 3CCD video camera system ( MBF 21 Biosciences , VT ) and an Intel Xeon workstation ( Intel ) . Automated imaging was 22 implemented using the Stereo Investigator software package ( MBF Biosciences , VT ) . 23 32 Analyzed brain sections spanned from - 1 . 355mm to - 2 . 88mm from Bregma . A total of six 1 sections , every 7th to 8th section ( 280 ‚Äì 320Œºm apart ) , were stained , imaged , and fed to a 2 pre - validated plaque detection algorithm . Automated plaque quantification was optimized 3 and validated prior to use by comparing the results of a validation set to the results from 4 three independent human countings . 5 6 Quantification of microglial markers . Hippocampus and cortex were outlined according 7 to the Paxinos atlas of the mouse brain . An average of 15 sections , spanning from 1 . 055mm 8 to - 3 . 68mm from Bregma , were used . Single - cell Iba1 , FcŒ≥RI , CD68 , and pSyk 9 fluorescence intensity were filtered for noise reduction and calculated using MATLAB 10 ( MathWorks , Natick , MA ) . 11 12 RT - qPCR .

Murine embryonic microglia cell - line N9 ( Corradin et al . , 21 1993 ) were grown in Dulbecco‚Äôs modified Eagle‚Äôs medium ( DMEM ) , supplemented with 22 33 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) , penicillin , streptomycin , and L - glutamine for 3 - 4 days to 1 reach confluence . 2 3 Murine primary microglia culture . Adult primary microglia were harvested from 2 - 4 month old C57BL6 / j mice and cultured , as previously described ( Moussaud & Draheim , 5 2010 ) . Briefly , mice were anesthetized using Ketamine - Xylazine ( 100mg / kg , Vetoquinol , 6 France , 10mg / kg , Eurovet , The Netherlands , respectively ) and perfused with cold Hanks‚Äô 7 Balanced Salt Solution ( HBSS , 14175 , Thermo - Fisher Scientific , Waltham , MA ) . Brains 8 were minced with a scalpel in an enzymatic solution containing papain and were incubated 9 for 90 minutes at 37¬∞C , 5 % CO 2 . After 90 minutes , the enzymatic reaction was quenched 10 with 20 % FBS in HBSS , and cells were centrifuged for 7 minutes at 200g . The pellet was 11 resuspended in 2ml of 0 . 5 mg / ml DNase in HBSS and incubated for 5min at room 12 temperature . The tissue was gently disrupted , filtered through a 70mm - cell strainer , and 13 centrifuged at 200g for 7 minutes . The pellet was resuspended in 20ml of 20 % isotonic 14 Percoll in HBSS , and pure HBSS was carefully overlaid on top of the cells - Percoll layer , 15 followed by centrifuging at 200g for 20 min with slow acceleration and no brakes . The 16 pellet , containing the mixed glial cell population , was washed once in HBSS and suspended 17 in Dulbecco‚Äôs Modified Eagle‚Äôs / F12 medium ( DMEM / F12 ) supplemented with 10 % FBS , 18 penicillin , streptomycin , L - glutamine and 10 ng / ml of carrier - free murine recombinant 19 granulocyte and macrophage colony - stimulating factor ( GM - CSF , 415 - ML , R & D systems , 20 Minneapolis , MN ) . Cell suspension from one brain was plated in a T75 - cell culture flask 21 coated with poly - D - lysine ( P7280 , Sigma , St . Louis , MO ) and maintained at 37¬∞C , 5 % CO 2 22 humidified incubator . The medium was changed twice a week . When full confluency was 23 34 reached ( after ~ 2 weeks ) , the floating cell layer , which includes pure microglia , was 1 collected and centrifuged for 5 minutes at 400g . The pellet was then plated without GM - 2 CSF on glass coverslips on 24 - well plates for phagocytosis assay . 3 4 Syk inhibition . Highly - selective Syk inhibitor BAY - 61 - 3606 ( B9685 , Sigma , St . Louis , 5 MO ) ( Yamamoto et al . , 2003 ) , dissolved in 80 % DMSO , was applied to N9 cells at 6 different concentrations , ranging from 0 . 75 to 5¬µM for 2h , followed by the addition of 7 aggregated human AŒ≤ 42 peptide at a concentration of 750nM ( ab120301 , Abcam , 8 Cambridge , UK ) . Briefly , AŒ≤ peptide was diluted in DMEM to a concentration of 7 . 5mM 9 and incubated for 1h at 37¬∞C to induce aggregation . Inhibition of Syk and downstream 10 signaling molecules were assessed using western blotting and previously described . 11 12 Protein extraction from cell - line and primary microglia . Cells were lysed in 0 . 1 % SDS 13 RIPA buffer ( 150mM NaCl , 5mM EDTA , 50mM Tris - base , 1 % Triton , 0 . 5 % Na - 14 deoxycholate , 0 . 1 % SDS in aqueous solution ) containing protease inhibitor ( 1 : 100 , P2714 , 15 Sigma , St . Louis , MO ) and phosphate inhibitor ( 1 : 100 , P5726 , Sigma , St . Louis , MO ) 16 cocktails and incubated for 30min on ice , then centrifuged at 17 , 000g for 20min . The 17 supernatant was separated , and total protein concentration was measured using the BCA 18 method . 19 20 Fluorescent - beads phagocytosis assay . N9 cells were deprived of FBS and incubated this 21 Syk inhibitor BAY - 61 - 3606 ( 5¬µM ) for 3h . 1¬µm - fluorescent beads ( L1030 , Sigma , St . 22 Louis , MO ) were pre - coated with FBS for 1h at 37¬∞C , then applied to cells at a dilution of 23 35 1 : 1000 for 1h at 37¬∞C . Cells were then washed five times with PBS ( containing calcium 1 and magnesium ) and trypsinized . Phagocytic FITC + cell count was conducted using the 2 BD - LSRFortessa cell analyzer ( BD bioscience , East Rutherford , NJ ) . 3 4 AŒ≤ phagocytosis assay . AŒ≤ 42 peptide ( ab120301 , Abcam , Cambridge , UK ) was diluted in 5 DMEM and incubated for 3h at 37¬∞C to induce aggregation . Aggregated AŒ≤ was incubated 6 with serum from anti - AŒ≤ vaccinated mice , sham - vaccinated mice , or DMEM ( 500 ng / ml 7 antibody , determined by ELISA ) for 1h at 37¬∞C with gentle agitation , to produce Ab - Ag 8 complex . N9 and primary cells were treated with 5¬µM BAY - 61 - 3606 for 3h for Syk 9 inhibition and incubated with aggregated AŒ≤ with or without the addition of serum for 4h . 10 Next , cells were washed five times with PBS ( containing calcium and magnesium ) . For 11 immunofluorescence , cells were fixed with 4 % PFA and permeabilized using 0 . 3 % PBS - 12 triton . Next , cells were stained with an anti - CD68 , anti - AŒ≤1 - 14 , and antibodies 13 ( Supplementary Table . 1 ) , as previously described . Unbiased stereological counting of AŒ≤ 14 foci was performed using the Stereo - investigator software with a counting frame of 15 300x300¬µm . For FACS analysis , cells were fixed with 4 % PFA , permeabilized using 0 . 3 % 16 PBS - triton , and stained for intracellular AŒ≤ using an anti - AŒ≤1 - 14 antibody ( Supplementary 17 Table . 1 ) . AŒ≤ - containing cell count was conducted using the BD - LSRFortessa cell analyzer 18 ( BD bioscience , East Rutherford , NJ ) . 19 20 Statistical analysis . The data presented as mean ¬± SEM were tested for significance in the 21 unpaired t - test with equal variances , one - way ANOVA , repeated measures ( RM ) two - way 22 ANOVA , two - sample Kolmogorov - Smirnov test , Pearson‚Äôs correlation coefficient , or the 23 36 œá 2 test for independence . Post - hoc tests were conducted using the Tukey or Bonferroni 1 corrections . All error bars represent SEM were calculated as ùê¨ùê≠ùêù ( ùê± ) ‚àöùêß for numeric variables , 2 and as ‚àö ùê© ( ùüè‚àíùê© ) ùêß for binomial variables . Outliers were identified using the robust regression 3 and outlier removal ( ROUT ) method with coefficient Q = 1 % ( Motulsky & Brown , 2006 ) . 4 Significant results were marked according to conventional critical P values : * P < 0 . 05 , 5 * * P < 0 . 01 , * * * P < 0 . 001 , * * * * P < 0 . 0001 . 6 7 Data availability 8 All the data supporting the findings of this study as well as MATLAB codes are freely 9 available upon request . 10 11 Acknowledgements 12 This study was conducted in the Paul Feder laboratory of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease research and 13 was supported by the Clore Israel Foundation . 14 15 Author contribution 16 TI and EO conceptualized and designed this study .
