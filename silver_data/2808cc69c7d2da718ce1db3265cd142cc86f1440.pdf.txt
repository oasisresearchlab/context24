Abstract The cytoskeletal protein talin plays a key role in coupling the integrin family of cell adhesion molecules to the actin cytoskeleton . In this paper I present a brief review on talin and summarize our recent studies , in which we have taken both genetic and structural approaches to further elucidate the function of the protein . Introduction There is now extensive evidence that the cytoskeletal protein talin plays a pivotal role in coupling the integrin family of cell adhesion molecules to the actin cytoskeleton [ 1 ] . More - over , talin also activates integrins [ 2 ] , probably by relieving the electrostatic interaction between the α - and β - subunit cytoplasmic tails [ 3 ] . The structure and biochemical proper - ties of talin make it perfectly suited for such a role . It is an elongated ( approx . 60 nm ) flexible molecule [ 4 ] , reportedly an antiparallel dimer [ 5 ] . The globular talin head contains aFERM ( four - point - one , ezrin , radixin , moesin ) domain ( res - idues 86 – 400 ) with binding sites for β - integrin cytodomains [ 6 ] , and two signalling proteins , FAK ( focal adhesion kinase ) [ 7 ] and the type 1 γ 661 isoform of PIPK ( phosphatidyl - inositol - 4 - phosphate 5 - kinase ) [ 8 , 9 ] , which regulate the dynamic properties of integrin - containing cell – extracellular matrix junctions or FAs ( focal adhesions ) . The FERM do - main also contains an actin - binding site [ 10 ] , and there is an adjacent membrane insertion sequence [ 11 ] which may account for the ability of talin to create holes in liposomes [ 12 , 13 ] . The talin rod , which is responsible for dimer form - ation , contains a conserved C - terminal actin - binding site [ 14 , 15 ] homologous to that in Hip1R ( Huntingtin - interact - ing protein 1 - related ) and yeast Sla2p [ 16 ] , a second inte - grin - binding site [ 17 , 18 ] , and several binding sites for the cytoskeletal protein vinculin [ 19 , 20 ] , which itself has multiple binding partners , including F - actin [ 21 ] . The talin head reportedly binds acidic phospholipids [ 11 ] , and PtdIns - ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 activates the integrin - binding sites in talin [ 22 ] , although both require further investigation . Whether talin is regulated by an intramolecular head – tail interaction that is re - lieved by PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 as for other FERM proteins is un - clear , although talin can adopt a globular conformation in Key words : actin cytoskeleton , integrin , talin , vinculin - binding site .

Integrin signalling via FAK and Src promotes binding of talin to PIPK [ 23 ] , although this effect may be indirect . Src phosphorylates Tyr 649 in the C - terminal region of the PIPK type 1 γ 661 isoform , and this suppresses phosphorylation of the adjacent Ser 650 by ERK ( extracellular - signal - regulated kinase ) ; phosphorylation of Ser 650 inhibits the interaction between PIPK and talin [ 24 ] . Binding of talin to PIPK activ - ates the kinase , and results in translocation of the complex to the plasma membrane [ 8 ] . This suggests a model in which the localized production of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 at the plasma mem - brane activates talin , which then binds to and activates integrins , and in so doing provides a link between integrins and the actin cytoskeleton . Recent data also suggest a role for phospholipase D 2 in integrin adhesion , via a mechanism which involves a different isoform of PIPK type 1 γ [ 25 ] . Recruitment of additional components to the initial integrin – talin – F - actin complexes might then ( i ) stabilize the complex and facilitate maturation into larger FAs and ( ii ) regulate the dynamic properties of FAs and therefore cell motility . There are two talin genes in mammals The Tln1 and Tln2 genes each encode proteins composed of 2541 amino acids ( approx . 74 % identity ) , and it seems probable that they will bind to a similar repertoire of proteins . The genes each contain 57 exons , and intron / exon boundaries are totally conserved , but the Tln2 gene is approx . 190 kb , whereas Tln1 is approx . 30 kb in size [ 26 ] . The difference is because of the much larger introns present in Tln2 . Northern blots suggest that Tln2 is expressed in a more restricted set of tissues than the ubiquitously expressed Tln1 , and Tln2 gene trap mice show high levels of expression in skeletal and cardiac muscle as well as brain ( Y . El - Jai , S . J . Monkley , C . A . Pritchard and D . R . Critchley , unpublished work ) . Interestingly , there are two talin genes in Dictyostelium ( TalA and TalB ) that play distinct roles in adhesion [ 27 ] and morphogenesis [ 28 ] respectively , although Drosophila [ 29 ] and Caenorhabditis elegans [ 30 ] appear to have only a single talin gene . C (cid:1) 2005 Biochemical Society Cell Architecture : from Structure to Function 1309 Additional roles for talin Interestingly , new unexpected roles for talin have recently emerged . For example , the talin – PIPK interaction is required for the final stages of clathrin - mediated endocytosis in the synpase [ 31 ] . Talin has been reported to co - localize and to co - immunoprecipitate with β 1 - integrins in Golgi / ER ( endo - plasmic reticulum ) fractions [ 32 ] , and HeLa cells transfected with a Tln1 antisense RNA showed defects in integrin pro - cessing [ 33 ] . Tln1 − / − ES ( embryonic stem ) cells also showed a dramatic reduction in β 1 - integrin protein [ 34 ] , and the possibility that a talin – PIPK plays a role in the formation of integrin - containing Golgi transport vesicles merits inves - tigation . A recent report shows that talin is important in the negative regulation of DE - cadherin transcription in Droso - phila ovarian follicle cells [ 35 ] , although the mechanism has not been elucidated . It will be important to establish whether talin plays a wider role in regulating cadherin gene expression in other tissues and organisms . Talin has been localized to the mid - body in mammalian cells and is therefore implicated in cytokinesis [ 36 ] . Indeed , knock - out of the TalA gene in Dictyostelium resulted in multinucleate cells [ 27 ] , and TalA has been shown to be crucial for myosin II - independent and adhesion - dependent cytokinesis [ 37 ] . ( Interestingly , TalA has recently been shown to bind myosin VII [ 38 ] . ) A conditional mouse Tln1 allele for studies of the role of talin1 in development Our original Tln1 knock - out studies in mouse [ 39 ] were restricted by the fact that Tln1 − / − mice die at approx . 8 . 5 days post - coitus ( only slightly later than the β 1 - integrin knock - out ) , in part due to failure to complete gastrulation , thought to be one of the earliest integrin - mediated developmental events . Therefore , it was not possible to study the role of talin1 in tissue morphogenesis , or to isolate Tln1 − / − MEFs ( mouse embryo fibroblasts ) for in vitro studies . To address these problems , we have recently generated mice that carry a Tln1 conditional allele ( Tln1 + / fl , where fl is floxed ) in which two loxP sites flank coding exons 1 to 4 . We have confirmed that Tln1 − / − mice ( derived by intercrossing with Cre - recombinase mice ) have a phenotype very similar to the conventional Tln1 knock - outs described previously [ 39 ] , and mice carrying the conditional Tln1 allele are now available for studies on the role of talin1 in specific tissues during development and in the adult . We have also successfully derived Tln1 − / fl and Tln1 + / fl MEFs . Transient co - transfection of Cre - recombinase with an FA marker such as GFP ( green fluorescent protein ) – paxillin into the Tln1 − / fl cells by nucleofection ( approx . 70 % trans - fection efficiency ) showed a rapid reduction ( within 24 h ) of GFP – paxillin - positive FAs , reduced spread - cell area and a marked reduction in talin immunoreactivity as judged by Western blotting . In contrast , Tln1 + / fl MEFs retained the wild - type phenotype after Cre transfection ( S . J . Monkley , C . A . Pritchard and D . R . Critchley , unpublished work ) . This result is consistent with previous Tln1 knock - out studies in ES cells [ 34 ] , and the Tln1 − / fl MEFs should be a useful tool for further talin structure – function studies . The immediate questions under investigation are as follows : ( i ) Is integrin binding to the talin1 FERM domain essential for FA assembly , since a second integrin - binding site has been mapped to the talin rod [ 17 ] ( residues 1984 – 2113 ) [ 18 ] . Crystallographic data show that the β 3 - integrin cytodomain docks into the talin FERM F3 subdomain , and that mutation of talin R358A abolishes integrin binding [ 6 ] . Expression of a talin R358A mutant in the conditional Tln - 1 − / fl knock - out cells should establish whether it can rescue the FA defects induced by Cre . However , NMR [ 40 ] and crystallographic [ 41 ] data show that the F3 subdomain also binds PIPK via the same hydrophobic groove , and the R358A mutation again inhibitsbinding . Therefore , interpretationoftheaboveresults may be less clear cut than anticipated , although the talin F3 subdomain / PIPK structure may help to identify mutations that selectively inhibit either integrin or PIPK binding . ( ii ) Is the C - terminal actin - binding site in talin1 essential for FA assembly ? The C - terminal actin - binding site in talin is reportedly the dominant actin - binding site [ 15 ] , so mutations in this site should block the ability of talin to couple integrins to actomyosin . Indeed , optical trap experiments showed that a truncated talin lacking this site was unable to support the formation of the weak linkage between fibronectin - coated beads and the actin cytoskeleton in Tln1 − / − fibroblasts derived from ES cells [ 42 ] . However , we have recently charac - terized an actin - binding site in the talin FERM domain [ 10 ] , and mutations that selectively inactivate one or other of these sites will be required to establish their role in talin function . ( iii ) Do the talin head and rod domains function inde - pendently ? Calpain 2 ( m - calpain ) cleavage of talin1 is in - volved in FA turnover [ 43 ] . However , the talin rod has been localized to FAs [ 44 ] . Moreover , m - calpain is implicated in activation of the integrin - binding site ( s ) in talin [ 45 ] . Since both the talin FERM and rod domains contain integrin - and actin - binding sites , they might function independently . In activated platelets , the talin head released by calpain cleavage ( and not the rod ) is selectively retained with integrin α IIb β 3 in Triton X - 100 cytoskeletons [ 46 ] , suggesting that the talin FERM domain may serve to link integrins to F - actin in platelets . ( iv ) Can talin2 , α - actinin - 1 , tensin or filamin rescue the Tln1 − / − phenotype ? Our ES - derived Tln1 − / − cells up - regu - late talin2 with passage , and this may explain why they regain their FAs , although filamin is also up - regulated . Therefore it will be important to establish whether the Tln2 cDNA can rescue the Tln1 − / − MEF phenotype . In the same way , it will also be important to test whether α - actinin - 1 , filamin and tensin , allofwhichbindintegrinsandF - actin , cancompensate for loss of talin1 . The talin – vinculin interaction One of the most well - characterized talin binding proteins is vinculin , which co - localizes with talin in many different types of integrin - mediated cell junctions , although vinculin also co - localizes with cadherins in cell – cell junctions [ 21 ] . Despite the extensive literature on vinculin , the precise C (cid:1) 2005 Biochemical Society 1310 Biochemical Society Transactions ( 2005 ) Volume 33 , part 6 function of the protein in FAs is still far from clear [ 47 ] . Vinculin null cells are less well spread , are more motile , and have fewer and smaller FAs than wild - type cells [ 48 ] . The spreading defect may be owing to the fact that the SH3 ( Src homology 3 ) protein vinexin fails to localize to FAs in the absence of vinculin [ 49 ] ( vinexin has previously been impli - cated in epidermal - growth - factor - mediated cell spreading [ 50 ] ) . Moreover , vinculin binds the Arp ( actin - related pro - tein ) 2 / 3 complex , an interaction implicated in lamellipodia formation [ 51 ] . ( Given this , it is perhaps surprising that vinculin null cells are more motile . ) The finding that the recruitment of vinculin to FAs is stimulated by applied force [ 52 ] , and that vinculin reduces FA turnover [ 53 ] , suggests that vinculin may stabilize the initial integrin – talin – F - actin complexes , perhaps by cross - linking talin to F - actin . How - ever , vinculin appears to play additional roles ; e . g . vinculin null cells are more resistant to apoptosis , apparently owing to the fact that FAK / paxillin signalling is constitutive in the absence of vinculin [ 54 ] . Therecentcrystalstructuresofvinculinshowhowaninter - action between the vinculin head and tail renders many of the ligand - binding sites cryptic [ 55 , 56 ] . This intramolecular interaction can be relieved by a talin peptide [ 57 ] containing one of the vinculin - binding sites contained within the talin rod , raisingthepossibilitythattalinmayplayaroleinvinculin activation . PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 has also been shown to activate vinculin [ 58 ] , although the physiological significance of this has been challenged by the observation that vinculin mutants deficient in PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding still localize to FAs and suppress cell motility [ 53 ] . However , FA turnover in cells expressing such mutants is reduced , and vinculin has been suggested to regulate FA dynamics by acting as a PtdIns - ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 sensor [ 53 ] . Characterization of the VBSs ( vinculin - binding sites ) in the talin rod We previously identified several VBSs in the talin rod using a series of overlapping recombinant talin polypeptides and a vinculin SDS - gel blot assay [ 19 ] , and three VBSs were further localizedtoastretchofapprox . 25aminoacids ( eachpredicted to be a single amphipathic α - helix ) using a yeast two - hybrid assay [ 20 ] . More recently , we have synthesized peptides rep - resenting each of the 63 predicted α - helices in the talin rod and identified an additional 8 VBS sequences , giving a total of 11 VBSs . The new VBSs were probably missed in the original study owing to the fact VBSs tend to be clustered within the talin rod , and so deletion of one VBS would not necessarily abolish vinculin binding to a large talin polypeptide . Given that all of the approx . 63 talin helices are amphipathic in nature , we sought to explain why only approx . 11 helices bind vinculin . Using talin VBS mutant peptides , we have defined a consensus for vinculin binding ( LXXAAXXVAXXVXXLIXXA , where X is any amino acid residue ) . Positions 1 , 8 , 12 , 15 and 16 require an aliphatic resi - due and will not tolerate alanine , whereas positions 4 , 5 and 9 are less restrictive [ 59 ] . Thus the key determinants of vinculin binding are hydrophobic residues that are located on one face of an amphipathic α - helix . The structure of VBSs in talin To define further the molecular basis of the vinculin – talin in - teraction , we have determined the structure of several regions of the talin rod which contain VBSs . The crystal structure of the N - terminal part of the rod ( residues 482 – 789 ) [ 60 ] , and the NMR structure of an adjacent region ( residues 755 – 889 ) [ 61 ] show that the rod is composed of a series of amphipathic helical bundles . Based on these two structures , we have developed a model of residues 482 – 889 that is made up of a 5 - helix bundle that interacts with the adjacent 7 - helix bundle via a hydrophobic patch on each of the bundles . VBS1 ( helix 4 ) is contained within the first bundle , whereas the 7 - helix bundle contains an additional four VBSs . We have used a variety of binding assays to monitor the interaction between recombinant talin polypeptides and vinculin , includ - ing competitive ELISA , gel filtration and NMR . These show that although VBS1 is cryptic , one or more of the four VBSs in the 7 - helix bundle can bind vinculin [ 60 , 61 ] . The crystal structures of several talin VBS peptides bound to the N - terminal region of vinculin ( Vd1 ; residues 1 – 258 ) [ 60 , 62 ] confirm that the key determinants of vinculin binding are hydrophobic residues on one face of the talin VBS helix . These are normally buried in the core of the talin amphipathic helical bundles , and indeed contribute to the stability of the fold . Interestingly , NMR shows that a talin 4 - helix bundle comprising residues 755 – 889 undergoes a marked conform - ational change upon Vd1 binding ; indeed , one helix unfolds completely [ 61 ] . Together , this suggests a model in which vinculin Vd1 extracts a VBS helix from a helical bundle within the talin rod , and the VBS hydrophobic residues that deter - minebindingspecificitybecomeburiedwithinahydrophobic groove within the N - terminal vinculin Vd1 α - helical bundle [ 60 ] . To test this model we have introduced mutations into the talin 755 – 889 4 - helix bundle , which stabilizes the fold as judged by CD at increasing temperatures . As predicted , these mutations markedly reduce vinculin binding , indicating that helical - bundle stability may be an important factor in deter - mining whether a given VBS within the talin rod is available for vinculin binding ( B . Patel , A . R . Gingras , A . A . Bobkov , L . M . Fujimoto , R . C . Liddington , D . Mazzeo , J . Emsley , G . C . Roberts , I . L . Barsukov and D . R . Critchley , unpublished work ) . How many VBSs are active in whole talin ? To address this question , we used competitive ELISA ; we assayed the ability of GST ( glutathione S - transferase ) – vinculin Vd1 to bind to a constitutively active talin VBS1 polypeptide on plastic , in the presence of increasing concen - trations of smooth - muscle talin or recombinant talin poly - peptides . The results showed that talin was not an effective competitor in this assay , although talin was able to bind GST – Vd1 in pull down assays . We conclude that one or more of the VBSs in talin are available for binding , but that the affinity C (cid:1) 2005 Biochemical Society Cell Architecture : from Structure to Function 1311 of the interaction is low relative to that of talin polypeptides , which have been engineered to contain a constitutively active VBS . Vinculin binding to talin polypeptides causes a major con - formational change in the talin molecule , exposing previously cryptic protease - cleavage sites [ 60 ] . Therefore , we explored the possibility that vinculin binding to intact talin might simi - larly induce local conformational changes in the talin rod , which would be revealed by enhanced sensitivity to protease cleavage . Interestingly , binding of GST – Vd1 to talin exposed a previously cryptic trypsin - cleavage site between residues 898 and 899 . Moreover , the N - terminal fragment liberated from the rod that should contain residues 482 – 898 failed to accumulate as a Coomassie Blue - positive band , although it could be detected using a monoclonal antibody 8d4 ( epitope residues 482 – 655 ) . There are five VBSs within residues 482 – 889 , whereas the adjacent C - terminal region is devoid of VBSs . We conclude that there are one or more active VBSs within the N - terminal region of the talin rod , which upon Vd1 binding undergo a conformational change that renders this region protease - sensitive ( B . Patel , A . R . Gingras , A . A . Bobkov , L . M . Fujimoto , R . C . Liddington , D . Mazzeo , J . Emsley , G . C . Roberts , I . L . Barsukov and D . R . Critchley , unpublished work ) . What determines the activity of the other VBSs in the talin rod remains to be elucidated . One attractive possibility is that theforceexertedontalinbyactomyosincontractionmayhelp to destabilize the helical bundles within the talin rod , thereby exposing the VBSs . Alternatively , phosphorylation may play a role . There are a total of 28 tyrosine residues in talin , only 13 of which are found in the over 2000 amino acids that make up the rod . Interestingly , the tyrosines appear to be located at the top or bottom of the helical bundles , and it will be interesting to see whether phosphorylation of these tyrosines affects the activity of the VBSs in the talin rod . However , currently there are no published data to indicate that the talin rod is tyrosine phosphorylated within the cell . References 1 Critchley , D . R . ( 2004 ) Biochem . Soc .
