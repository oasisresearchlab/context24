It has been proved that the desired physicochemical properties of nanoparticles were ef ﬁ cient for obtaining a high cellular uptake capacity . On the other hand , biophysical stimuli from in situ microenvironment were also indicated as another essential factor in the regulation of cellular uptake capacity . Unfortunately , the in ﬂ uence of colony morphology on cellular uptake capacity was rarely analyzed . In this study , micropatterned PDMS stencils containing circular holes of 800 / 1 , 200 μ m in diameter were applied to control colonies ’ size . The amino - modi ﬁ ed nanoparticles were cocultured with micropatterned colonies to analyze the in ﬂ uence of colonies ’ morphology on the cellular uptake capacity of nanoparticles . Consequently , more endocytosed nanoparticles in larger colonies were related with a bigger dose of nanoparticles within a larger area . Additionally , the high cell density decreased the membrane – nanoparticles ’ contacting probability but enhanced clathrin - mediated endocytosis . With these contrary effects , the cells with medium cell density or located in the peripheral region of the micropatterned colonies showed a higher cellular uptake capacity of nanoparticles . Keywords : morphological cues , micropattern , cellular uptake , nanoparticles , colony INTRODUCTION Recently , various nanoparticles were designed and prepared for biomedical applications ( Li et al . , 2019 ; Li et al . , 2021 ; Yang et al . , 2021 ) . Ef ﬁ cient cellular uptake of nanoparticles ( NPs ) is recognized as the prime condition for the achievement of high - yield therapeutic ef ﬁ cacy ( Iversen et al . , 2011 ; Liang et al . , 2020 ) . Tuning the physicochemical properties of NPs is an approachable route to improving the cellular uptake capacity ( Oh and Park , 2014 ; Li et al . , 2021 ) . However , the optimization of NPs ’ surface properties may lead to the cytotoxicity of NPs ( Lewinski et al . , 2008 ) . On the other hand , cell – NP interaction and cellular uptake processes were also ef ﬁ cient for the regulation of cellular uptake capacity ( Adjei et al . , 2014 ) . Therefore , novel techniques depending on the modulation of cell behaviors were required to avoid side effects of NP properties ’ optimization . Previous evidence demonstrated that the biophysical stimuli from in situ microenvironment can be applied to manipulate the cellular uptake process ( Huang et al . , 2017 ) . It is worth noting that physical boundary conditions were critical in regulating cell behaviors ( Yang et al . , 2018 ; Wang et al . , 2021a ) . For instance , the effects of a single cell ’ s morphological cues on cell functions were revealed by Edited by : Yu Luo , Shanghai University of Engineering Sciences , China Reviewed by : Jingchao Li , Donghua University , China Puyang Gong , Southwest Minzu University , China * Correspondence : Bingshe Xu xubingshe @ sust . edu . cn Yingjun Yang yang . yingjun @ sust . edu . cn † These authors have contributed equally to this work Specialty section : This article was submitted to Nanobiotechnology , a section of the journal Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology Received : 17 April 2022 Accepted : 26 April 2022 Published : 31 May 2022 Citation : Huang S , Su Q , Hou X , Han K , Ma S , Xu B and Yang Y ( 2022 ) In ﬂ uence of Colonies ’ Morphological Cues on Cellular Uptake Capacity of Nanoparticles .

Additionally , the signi ﬁ cant in ﬂ uence of spatial factors on colonies ’ tumorigenesis ( Lee et al . , 2016 ; Lee et al . , 2020 ) and gastrulation ( Deglincerti et al . , 2016 ; Morgani et al . , 2018 ) has been explored by many studies . All of these results indicated the importance of morphological cues in regulating the functions of a cell or colony . Recently , the relationship between cellular uptake capacity and single cell morphology has been illustrated ( Wang et al . , 2016 ; Yang et al . , 2019a ; Wang et al . , 2022 ) . Whereas , in scienti ﬁ c research and clinical practice , a multicellular colony was more common than single - cell status . Unfortunately , even the in ﬂ uence of morphological cues on colonies ’ behaviors was explained , and their effects on colonies ’ uptake capacity were still unclear . In this case , elucidating the relationship between colonies ’ morphological cues and the cellular uptake capacity of NPs will provide some essential information for the improvement of NPs ’ uptake ef ﬁ cacy through regulating physical boundary conditions . In this study , the effects of colonies ’ morphology on the cellular uptake capacity of NPs were investigated by using micropatterned PDMS stencils . The PDMS stencils containing circular micro - holes of 0 . 8 and 1 . 2 mm in diameter were prepared to control colonies ’ size . The melanoma cells with different seeding densities were cultured on the stencils to form micropatterned colonies with different sizes and cell densities . Then , the amino - modi ﬁ ed ﬂ uorescence polystyrene NPs were FIGURE1 | PreparationofPDMSstencilsandmorphologyofmicropatternedcolonies .

Colonies ’ Morphology and Nanoparticles ’ Uptake incubated with micropatterned colonies to investigate the in ﬂ uence of colonies ’ morphology on the cellular uptake capacity . Firstly , the distribution of cells and endocytosed NPs in micropatterned colonies was observed and analyzed . To explore the reason for morphological cues affecting cellular uptake capacity , the cell morphology and cytoskeleton structure were also characterized . MATERIALS AND METHODS Preparation of PDMS Stencils The stencils were prepared by a simple punching process . In detail , the PDMS ﬁ lm with 100 μ m in thickness was commercially purchased from Hangzhou Bald Advanced Materials Technology Co . , Ltd . The PDMS ﬁ lms were ﬁ rstly cut into a circular shape of 14 mm in diameter . Then , the holes of 0 . 8 mm or 1 . 2 mm in diameter were manufactured on the circular PDMS ﬁ lm by using a speci ﬁ c puncher . Before cell seeding , the prepared stencils were ﬁ rstly sterilized by immersing in 70 % ethanol for 20 min and rinsing in PBS solution twice . Finally , the stencils were placed in a 24 - well plate for cell culture . Cell Culture Melanoma cells ( B16 ) were purchased from Procell Lifer Science & Technology Co . , Ltd . and subcultured in DMEM medium ( Mishu ( Xi ’ an ) Biotechnology Co . , Ltd . ) supplied with 10 % FBS ( Biological Industries Israel Beit Haemek Ltd . ) and 1 % penicillin – streptomycin ( Mishu ( Xi ’ an ) Biotechnology Co . , Ltd . ) . A 1 ml cell suspension with 4 × 10 4 , 6 × 10 4 , and 8 × 10 4 cells / ml in cell density was seeded in each well . After being cultured in a humidi ﬁ ed CO 2 incubator for 6 h , the medium with suspending cells was refreshed . Then , the samples were further incubated for 18 h for the following experiments . Nuclei Staining and Cell Density Analysis After cell seeding for 24 h , the samples were rinsed with prewarmed PBS and ﬁ xed with 4 % cold paraformaldehyde ( Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co . , Ltd . ) for 10 min . Then , the samples were permeabilized by 1 % Triton X - 100 ( Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co . , Ltd . ) for 2 min and stained by 1 ‰ DAPI ( Shandong Sparkjade Scienti ﬁ c Instruments Co . , Ltd . ) in PBS for 10 min . The ﬂ uorescence of DAPI was observed and recorded by a ﬂ uorescence microscope ( MF52 - N , Guangzhou Micro - shot Technology Co . , Ltd . ) . The ﬂ uorescence images were applied to analyze cell distribution . To count cells in different regions , the colony was ﬁ rstly separated into the peripheral region and central region . To get the same area of the peripheral region and central region , the radius of the central region was set as 0 . 28 mm for micropatterned colonies with 0 . 8 mm in diameter and 0 . 42 mm for colonies with 1 . 2 mm in diameter . The cell numbers at the peripheral or central regions were counted from DAPI staining ﬂ uorescence images by analyzing the particles processed in ImageJ . More than 50 ﬂ uorescent images were applied to get heat maps , and ﬁ ve representative ﬂ uorescence images were analyzed to get quantitative data . Cellular Uptake Capacity Analysis After the cell seeding process for 24 h , the medium was replaced by a fresh medium with 1 % amino - modi ﬁ ed ﬂ uorescent PS NPs ( 100 nm , Xi ’ an ruixi Biological Technology Co . , Ltd . ) and further incubated for another 24 h in a humidi ﬁ ed CO 2 incubator . Then , the samples were harvested and incubated with 0 . 4 % trypan blue ( Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co . , Ltd . ) for 5 min to quench the ﬂ uorescence of extracellular NPs . Finally , the samples were ﬁ xed with 4 % paraformaldehyde and stained with 1 ‰ DAPI . The ﬂ uorescence of NPs and DAPI was observed and recorded by ﬂ uorescence microscopy . The percentage and ﬂ uorescence intensity of NP - positive cells were calculated to evaluate the cellular uptake capacity . To de ﬁ ne NP - positive cells , the integrated gray value ( IGV ) and area ( A ) of each cell were calculated by ImageJ . To get the corrected IGV , the region without cell attachment was selected as the background to calculate IGV background and A background . Then , the corrected IGV was calculated by ( IGV / A - IGV background / A background ) ×A . The NP - positive cells were de ﬁ ned as the cells with corrected IGV two times higher than the IGV background . The percentage of NP - positive cells was calculated by the number of NP - positive cells divided by the total cell number . The corrected IGV of nanoparticle - positive cells was also recorded to evaluate the cellular uptake capacity . More than 30 ﬂ uorescent images of each group were analyzed . Actin and Nuclei Staining After cells were cultured within stencils for 24 h , the samples were ﬁ xed by 4 % paraformaldehyde for 10 min and permeabilized by 1 % Triton X - 100 for 2 min at room temperature . Then , the samples were blocked with 2 % bovine serum albumin ( BSA , Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co . , Ltd . ) in PBS for 30 min at room temperature . Then , actin was stained by incubating the samples with Alexa Fluor - 594 phalloidin ( Beijing Solarbio Science & Technology Co . , Ltd . ) at a dilution ratio of 1 : 40 in PBS for 20 min at room temperature . Nuclei were stained with 1 ‰ DAPI at room temperature in the dark for 10 min . After being washed with PBS three times , the ﬂ uorescence images of each sample were observed and recorded by a ﬂ uorescence microscope . Fifty ﬂ uorescent images were applied to obtain heat maps . Blebbistatin and Dynasore Treatment Blebbistatin ( Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co . , Ltd . ) and dynasore ( Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co . , Ltd . ) were applied to disturb the cytoskeleton organization and inhibit the dynamin activity . In detail , after the cell was cultured on stencils for 16 h , the medium was refreshed by a cell - cultured medium with 1 ng / ml blebbistatin or 40 μ M dynasore . After further culturing for 8 h , the medium was replaced by a fresh medium with 1 % amino - modi ﬁ ed ﬂ uorescent NPs and 1 ng / ml blebbistatin or 40 μ M dynasore . After further culturing in a humidi ﬁ ed CO 2 incubator for another 24 h , the samples were harvested and treated with 0 . 4 % trypan blue for 5 min . Before ﬂ uorescence observation , the samples were stained with DAPI .

Colonies ’ Morphology and Nanoparticles ’ Uptake NP - positive cells were also analyzed as previously described . More than 30 ﬂ uorescent images were analyzed . Statistical Analysis The signi ﬁ cant difference among samples was performed using a one - way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) with Tukey ’ s post hoc test for multiple comparisons . The data are presented as means ± standard deviations ( SDs ) . It is considered to be a statistically signi ﬁ cant difference when p < 0 . 05 . RESULTS Preparation and Characterization of Stencils As shown in Figure 1A , PDMS stencils were prepared by the punching process and applied for cell culture . The micro - holes with 0 . 8 mm or 1 . 2 mm in diameter were fabricated on a circular PDMS ﬁ lm with 14 mm in diameter by using a speci ﬁ c puncher ( Figures 1B , C ) . The diameter of the holes was 849 . 5 ± 33 . 9 μ m and 1 , 273 . 7± 62 . 6 μ m . After sterilization , the PDMS stencils tightly adhered to TCPS ( tissue culture polystyrene ) surfaces in 24 - well plates for the following cell experiments . Since the PDMS ﬁ lm ’ s hydrophobic properties do not encourage cell adhesion ( Subramaniam and Sethuraman , 2014 ) , cells tended to adhere to the TCPS surface that bore micro - holes from the PDMS stencils ( Choi et al . , 2012 ) . After the cell was cultured with PDMS stencils , colonies were formed within micro - holes of the stencil and the morphology of the colonies was controlled by PDMS stencils ( Figure 1D ) . After cell adhesion , the unadhered cells were easily removed by the medium refreshing process . Additionally , the stencil - associated micropatterning method had no signi ﬁ cant in ﬂ uence on cell viability ( Supplementary Figure S1 ) . Cell Distribution After the formation of micropatterned colonies , the diameter of the micropatterned melanoma colonies was 835 . 9 ± 14 . 1 μ m and FIGURE 2 | Cell distribution of micropatterned colonies .

Colonies ’ Morphology and Nanoparticles ’ Uptake diameter was higher than the colonies with 1 . 2 mm in diameter ( Figure 2B ) . Furthermore , cells predominantly adhered at the peripheral region of micropatterned colonies . To observe more clearly , more than 50 ﬂ uorescent images were applied to create heat maps ( Figure 2B ) . The heat maps showed the same phenomenon that melanoma cells concentrated in the peripheral region of micropatterned colonies , especially at low cell density . To quantitatively analyze the cell density at a different region of colonies , the central and peripheral regions with the same area were set , as shown in Figure 2C . As Figure 2D shows thequantitative results , the cell density in the peripheral region was signi ﬁ cantly higher than in the central region . In addition , with cell density increased , cells were more homogeneously distributed within smaller colonies . Cellular Uptake Capacity The cellular uptake of amino group - modi ﬁ ed ﬂ uorescent PS NPs is shown in Figures 3A , B . The cellular uptake capacity was indicated by the percentage and ﬂ uorescence intensity of NP - positive cells . The percentage of NP - positive cells was related to the ratio of cells , which could uptake NPs , and the ﬂ uorescence intensity of NP - positive cells was applied to indicate the amount of endocytosed NPs in each cell . In the results , colony size did not have a signi ﬁ cant effect on the percentage of NP - positive cells ( Figure 3C ) . On the other hand , the ﬂ uorescence intensity of cells in micropatterned colonies with 1 . 2 mm in diameter was higher than in the smaller colonies ( d = 0 . 8 mm ) ( Figure 3D ) . Furthermore , within the colonies having the same size , as the cell seeding density increased , the percentage of NP - positive cells was decreased ( Figures 4A , E . It was interesting that the ﬂ uorescence intensity of cells with a medium density was higher than the cells with low or high density ( Figures 4B , F ) . On the other hand , for the results of spatial factor that regulated the cellular uptake capacity , the percentage and ﬂ uorescence intensity of NP - positive cells ( Figures 4C , G and Figures 4D , H ) in the peripheral region were signi ﬁ cantly higher than the cells located in the central region . To explore the reason for these phenomena , the cytoskeleton of melanoma cells was analyzed . Structure of Cytoskeleton Since previous studies have demonstrated that the cellular uptake capacity is tightly related to the structure of the cytoskeleton ( Wang et al . , 2021a ; Wang et al . , 2021b ; Wang et al . , 2021c ) , the actin structure was characterized in this study . The structure of the cytoskeleton was analyzed by actin - stained ﬂ uorescence images ( Supplementary Figure S2 ) . The heat maps of actin ( Figure 5A ) revealed that actin was concentrated in the peripheral region of micropatterned colonies . This result had a good agreement with cell uneven distribution . As shown in the magni ﬁ ed ﬂ uorescent images ( Figure 5B ) , more spindle - shaped cells ( white arrow ) were observed in the central region of the micropatterned colony with low cell seeding density . In contrast , more circular - shaped cells ( green arrow ) were found in peripheral regions with high cell density . In addition , actin was concentrated in the cortical region in circular - shaped cells and homogeneously distributed in spindle - shaped cells ( Figure 5C ) . In ﬂ uence of Cytoskeleton on Cellular Uptake Capacity To explore the function of cytoskeleton in the cellular uptake process , the cytoskeleton was disrupted . As shown in Figure 6A , actin was disturbed by blebbistatin before and during cellular uptake experiments . After blebbistatin treatment , there was no signi ﬁ cant in ﬂ uence on the actin organization of spindle - shaped cells . In contrast , actin in the cortical region of cells with high density disappeared and was randomly distributed within the cytoplasm . In addition , the percentage ( Figure 6C ; Supplementary Figure S3A ) and ﬂ uorescence intensity ( Figure 6D ; Supplementary Figure S3B ) of NP - positive cells were slightly decreased after blebbistatin treatment . In ﬂ uence of Dynamin on Cellular Uptake Capacity In addition , at the ﬁ nal step of clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) , cortical actin is collaborated with dynamin to separate clathrin - coated pits from the plasma membrane ( Merri ﬁ eld et al . , 2002 ; Grassart et al . , 2014 ) . It means that cortical actin is functionalized not only at the process of endocytic membrane ’ invagination but also at the endocytic vesicles ’ separation . Therefore , the function of cortical actin and dynamin in the regulation of cellular uptake capacity was also investigated by the inhibition of dynamin activity . In this case , dynasore was applied to inhibit dynamin activity ( Macia et al . , 2006 ) . As shown in Figure 7A , dynasore was incubated with colonies before and during cellular uptake experiments . Quantitative data revealed that the percentage ( Figure 7C ; Supplementary Figure S4A ) and ﬂ uorescence intensity ( Figure 7D ; Supplementary Figure S4B ) of NP - positive cells were signi ﬁ cantly decreased after dynasore treatment . In addition , the ﬂ uorescence intensity has no signi ﬁ cant difference with different cell seeding densities after dynasore treatment ( Figure 7D ) . DISCUSSION In this study , micropatterned PDMS stencils were applied to control the morphology of melanoma colonies . After micropatterned colonies formed , the size and morphology of colonies were easily controlled by PDMS stencils and the cell density was regulated by the cell seeding process . For each colony , the cells were predominately located in the peripheral region . This phenomenon was similar to the cells cultured in microwell plates . This uneven distribution of cells has been explained by the effect of the meniscus ( Freshney , 2010 ) . Then , the results of cellular uptake capacity and morphological cues of colonies were comprehensively analyzed . Firstly , the ﬂ uorescence intensity of NP - positive cells in a larger colony was higher than the cells in a smaller colony ( Figure 3D ) . In common sense , with homogeneously distributed Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology | www . frontiersin . org May 2022 | Volume 10 | Article 922159 8 Huang et al . Colonies ’ Morphology and Nanoparticles ’ Uptake NPs , the colonies with a larger spreading area have a higher contact probability with NPs . Thus , this phenomenon was considered to be the result of a bigger dose of NPs . In addition , the role of cell density and spatial factors in the regulation of cellular uptake capacity was also analyzed . With cell density increased , more concentrated cells showed circular morphology and a smaller spreading area ( Figure 5B ) . This smaller spreading area induced a lower contact probability between the plasma membrane and NPs and ﬁ nally decreased the percentage of NP - positive cells ( Figures 4A , E ) ( Wang et al . , 2016 ; Khetan et al . , 2019 ) . In contrast , the ﬂ uorescence intensity of positive cells with medium density was higher than the cells with low density ( Figures 4B , F ) . It means that even if the percentage of NP - positive cells decreased , the cellular uptake capacity of each individual cell was enhanced by higher cell density . These controversial results indicated that the increased cell density could enhance the cellular uptake capacity of an individual cell but decrease the contacting probability between the cytoplasm membrane and NPs . Moreover , this inference was also supported by the decreased ﬂ uorescence intensity of NP - positive cells with the highest cell density . Furthermore , with the result of uneven cell distribution in micropatterned colonies ( Figure 2 ) , the concentrated cells in the peripheral region have the highest percentage and ﬂ uorescence intensity of NP - positive cells ( Figure 4 ) . It also indicated that the higher cellular uptake capacity was related to higher cell density . In this case , the structure and functions of the cytoskeleton were characterized . The cells with higher density showed more circular - shaped cells with the typical cortical actin . As previously reported , the cortical actin was critical for invagination of the endocytic membrane in CME ( Galletta et al . , 2010 ; Chaudhuri et al . , 2011 ) . Additionally , some research already revealed that CME is a primary approach for the cellular uptake of amino - modi ﬁ ed NPs ( Jiang et al . , 2010 ) . Thus , cortical actin was considered a critical factor in the regulation of the cellular capacity of NPs . Therefore , the higher cell density - enhanced cellular uptake capacity bene ﬁ ted from cortical actin - accelerated CME in circular - shaped cells with high cell density . To verify the functions of cortical actin in the regulation of cellular uptake capacity , the actin organization was disrupted by blebbistatin ( a speci ﬁ c myosin II inhibitor that can reduce cortical actin - mediated cortex tension ) ( Lu et al . , 2008 ; Tinevez et al . , 2009 ) . For the results , with the disappearance of cortical actin , cellular uptake capacity was decreased ( Figure 6 ) . This could be further evidence to support the fact that the higher cellular uptake capacity of concentrated cells bene ﬁ ted from the cortical actin - enhanced CME . Additionally , since the cortical actin also takes effect on dynamin during the endocytic membrane ’ s separation ( Loebrich , 2014 ) , the dynamin was suppressed by dynasore treatment . After dynasore treatment , FIGURE 6 | In ﬂ uence of the cytoskeleton structure on cellular uptake capacity . ( A ) Scheme of blebbistatin treatment .

Colonies ’ Morphology and Nanoparticles ’ Uptake the signi ﬁ cantly decreased cellular uptake capacity was independent of cell density ( Figure 7D ) . The effects of dynamin demonstrated the improved cellular uptake in higher cell density was mainly contributed by cortical actin assisted membrane separation . In summary , with a bigger dose of NPs , larger colonies endocytosed more NPs . In addition , the contrary effects of high cell density on the cellular uptake of NPs were revealed . Firstly , the concentrated cells with a circular shape showed typical cortical actin that can accelerate CME . On the other hand , the negative effect of high cell density on the cellular uptake capacity was associated with a decreased contacting probability between NPs and cytoplasm membrane . For these reasons , cells with higher density ( intermediate seeding density or located at the peripheral region of micropatterned colonies ) showed a higher cellular uptake capacity of NPs . CONCLUSION In this research , PDMS stencils were prepared and applied to control the morphologies of melanoma colonies . Subsequently , the in ﬂ uence of morphological cues on cellular uptake capacity has been revealed . The results indicated that more endocytosed NPs in larger colonies were related to a bigger dose of NPs within larger areas .
