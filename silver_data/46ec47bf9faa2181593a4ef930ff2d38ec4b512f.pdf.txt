Dual Inhibition of Classical Protein Kinase C - a and Protein Kinase C - b Isoforms Protects Against Experimental Murine Diabetic Nephropathy Jan Menne , 1 , 2 Nelli Shushakova , 1 , 2 Janina Bartels , 1 Yulia Kiyan , 1 Robert Laudeley , 1 Hermann Haller , 1 Joon - Keun Park , 1 and Matthias Meier 1 Activation of protein kinase C ( PKC ) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy with proteinuria and peritubular extracellular matrix production . We have previously shown that the PKC isoforms a and b mediate different cellular effects . PKC - b contributes to hyperglycemia - induced renal matrix production , whereby PKC - a is involved in the development of albuminuria . We further tested this hypothesis by deletion of both isoforms and used a PKC inhibitor . We analyzed the phenotype of nondiabetic and streptozotocin ( STZ ) - induced diabetic homo - zygous PKC - a / b double - knockout mice ( PKC - a / b 2 / 2 ) . After 8 weeks of diabetes mellitus , the high - glucose – induced renal and glomerular hypertrophy as well as transforming growth factor - b 1 ) and extracellular matrix production were diminished in the PKC - a / b 2 / 2 mice compared with wild - type controls . Urinary al - bumin / creatinine ratio also was signi ﬁ cantly reduced , however , it was not completely abolished in diabetic PKC - a / b 2 / 2 mice . Treat - ment with CGP41252 , which inhibits PKC - a and PKC - b , is able to prevent the development of albuminuria and to reduce existing albuminuria in type 1 ( STZ model ) or type 2 ( db / db model ) di - abetic mice . These results support our hypothesis that PKC - a and PKC - b contribute to the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy , and that dual inhibition of the classical PKC isoforms is a suitable therapeutic strategy in the prevention and treatment of diabetic nephropathy . Diabetes 62 : 1167 – 1174 , 2013 D iabetic nephropathy is the most common cause of progressive chronic kidney disease and end - stage renal disease in the Western world ( 1 ) . It is postulated that diabetic nephropathy may result from a local interplay of metabolic and hemody - namic factors either through direct effects of high - glucose levels or autocrine and paracrine actions of various vaso - active substances in the diabetic kidney ( 2 ) . More than 20 years ago , it was described that activation of the protein kinase C ( PKC ) system by hyperglycemia may represent an important mediator of glucotoxicity in diabetic ne - phropathy ( 3 , 4 ) . PKC constitutes a family of homologous serine / threonine kinases that are involved in many signal - ing events ( 5 ) . In mammals , a gene family of nine in - dependent gene loci is distributed over the whole genome ( 6 ) . Because of biochemical properties and sequence homologies , the PKC family is divided into classical ( a , b I , b II , g ) , novel ( d , e , h , u ) , and atypical ( z , i / l ) isoforms . The functional role of distinct PKC isoforms in the development of diabetic nephropathy has recently been further elucidated by means of single isoform - speci ﬁ c knockout mice ( 7 – 13 ) . We and others have revealed that activation of the PKC - b isoform contributes to high - glucose – induced , transforming growth factor ( TGF ) - b 1 – mediated renal hypertrophy and extracellular matrix expansion ( 9 , 14 ) , whereas perlecan and vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) as well as nephrin expression are regulated by a PKC - a – dependent signaling pathway leading to diabetic albuminuria ( 7 , 8 ) . To further understand the role of PKC isoforms in the development of diabetic nephropathy , we characterized the renal phenotype of homozygous PKC - a / b double knockout ( KO ) mice and tested the hypothesis that de - letion of both classical PKC isoforms , PKC - a and PKC - b , is able to completely abolish the development of experi - mental diabetic nephropathy in the streptozotocin ( STZ ) - induced diabetic stress model . Furthermore , we also tested if pharmacological inhibition of the classical PKC isoforms with the classical PKC inhibitor CGP41251 , the N - Benzoyl derivative of the naturally occurring alkaloid staurosporine , is safely achievable and bene ﬁ cial in type 1 ( STZ model ) and type 2 diabetic ( db / db mice ) animal models . CGP41251 previously has been used in several phase I – III cancer trials , showing an IC50 for the classical PKC isoforms of ; 20 – 30 nmol / L and for the novel isoforms between 160 and 1 , 250 nmol / L ( 15 ) . RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Animal studies . Experiments were performed with male 129 / SV wild - type ( WT ) and PKC - a / b 2 / 2 KO mice . The latter were generated by breeding PKC - a 2 / 2 and PKC - b 2 / 2 , which have the same 129 / SV background strain ( 7 , 9 ) . The heterozygous PKC - a 2 / 2 and PKC - b 2 / 2 mice from the F1 generation were paired and double KO mice were identi ﬁ ed by genetic testing . The breeding was dif ﬁ cult because a maximum of one double KO mouse was found per litter . Although mice homozygotes for both mutations are viable and have normal life expectancy , they were not fertile . In consequence , no direct breeding of PKC - a / b 2 / 2 KO mice was possible to build a colony , which sig - ni ﬁ cantly limited our experimental setting for this study . A head - to - head comparison with the single KO PKC - a 2 / 2 and PKC - b 2 / 2 KO mouse strain was not performed ; instead , historical controls were used . Pharmacological studies with CGP41251 were performed in 8 - to 10 - week - old male 129 / SV ( Harlan ) or 8 - week - old db / db mice ( Charles River ) . The animals received a standard diet with free access to tap water . All procedures were performed according to guidelines from the Federation of European Laboratory Animal Science Associations and were approved by local authorities . The 8 - to 10 - week - old mice received either 125 mg / kg body weight STZ ( Sigma - Aldrich ) in 50 mmol / L sodium citrate ( pH 4 . 5 ) or sodium citrate buffer intraperitoneally on days 1 and 4 . Glucose levels from tail blood were measured with the glucometer Elite ( Bayer , Leverkusen , Germany ) every other day . Animals with glucose levels $ 16 mmol / L on two consecutive measurements were regarded as hypergly - cemic and glucose measurements were controlled every 2 weeks . The mice received no insulin .

CGP41251 was synthesized by LC Laboratories with a purity of 99 % and mixed into the standard chow . In a pilot study , blood concentration of CGP41251 was measured by mass spectroscopy ( LC labo - ratories ) . In the STZ - induced diabetic 129 / SV mice , treatment with CGP41251 ( 1mg / kg ) wasstartedimmediatelyafterthemicebecamediabetic , respectively , after 4 weeks and 12 weeks of diabetes . In the db / db mouse model , the pharmacological treatment was started immediately . ProQinase GmbH ( Frei - burg , Germany ) determined the IC50 for the different PKC isoforms ( a , b 1 , b 2 , g , d , e , u , and z ) by a radiometric ﬁ lter - binding kinase assay . Clinical chemistry . In animals participating in the pharmacological in - tervention , 24 - h urine was collected using metabolic cages ( Tecniplast ) . Al - bumin concentration was measured with a commercially available competitive ELISA following the instructions of the manufacturer ( Exocell , Philadelphia , PA ) and was normalized to urine creatinine de ﬁ ned as the albumin / creatinine ratio . In the KO mice , urine was collected by puncturing the bladder with a 23 - gauge needle during organ removal . Albumin was quanti ﬁ ed as described and creatinine was measured by means of the chemistry analyzer Olympus AU400 ( Olympus ) using standard reagents . The albumin / creatinine ratio was then calculated . Histological assessment . We obtained the animal kidneys for further mor - phological and immunohistochemical analyses . For this purpose , animals were euthanized according to the following protocol : after anesthesia with iso ﬂ uran via a nasal mask ( 2 % ) was administered , a laparotomy was performed . The organs were perfused with lactated Ringer solution via the left ventricle and the left kidney was removed after clipping of the renal artery and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen for Western blotting . Subsequently , the right kidney was perfused with 3 % paraformaldehyde , removed , and ﬁ xed for an additional 20hin3 % paraformaldehyde , andthenembeddedinparaf ﬁ n , sectionedat2 m m . For morphological evaluation , paraf ﬁ n sections were stained with trichrome Masson - Goldner staining and Sirius red staining following a standard protocol . Immunohistochemistry was performed using the following primary anti - bodies : perlecan ( RDI , Flanders , NJ ) , nephrin ( Progen , Heidelberg , Germany ) , VEGF ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA ) , nitrotyrosine , ﬁ bronectin ( Abcam , Cambridge , U . K . ) , type IV collagen ( Southern Biotech , Birmingham , AL ) , Wilms tumor - 1 , and TGF - b 1 ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) . For indirect immuno ﬂ uorescence , nonspeci ﬁ c binding sites were blocked with 10 % normal donkey serum ( Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratory ) for 30 min . Then , sections were incubated with the primary antibody for 1 h . All incubations were performed in a humid chamber at room temperature . For ﬂ uorescent visualization of bound primary antibodies , sections were further incubated with Cy3 conjugated secondary antibodies ( Jackson ImmunoResearch Labo - ratory ) for 1 h . Specimens were analyzed using a Zeiss Axioplan - 2 imaging microscope with the computer program AxioVision 4 . 8 ( Zeiss , Jena , Ger - many ) . Semi - quantitative analyses for the various target proteins were per - formed mainly by counting the numbers of glomeruli with distinct expression . Western blot . Kidney fragments were homogenized in modi ﬁ ed RIPA lysis buffer ( 50 mmol / L Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 4 ; 1 % Triton X - 100 ; 0 . 25 % Na - deoxycholate ; 150mmol / LNaCl ; 1 mmol / LEDTA ) supplementedwith1 mmol / LPMSF , 1 m g / mL aprotinin , 1 m g / mL leupeptin , 1 mmol / L Na 3 VO 4 , and 1 mmol / L NaF . Homoge - nates were clari ﬁ ed by centrifugation at 12 , 800 rpm for 10 min and were used for electrophoresis . Semi - dry Western blotting of PVDF membrane ( Roche Applied Science ) was performed using Bio - Rad Mini - PROTEAN system . VEGF and TGF - b 1 were quanti ﬁ ed using the same antibody as used for immuno - chemistry . Chemiluminescent Western blotting images were captured using VersaDoc - 3000 and were quanti ﬁ ed using Quantity One software ( Bio - Rad Laboratories ) . Statistics . Data are shown as mean 6 SD ( if not otherwise indicated ) . The data were compared by ANOVA with Bonferroni as post hoc test . Signi ﬁ cant differences were accepted with P , 0 . 05 . Data analysis was performed using Prism 5 . 0 software ( GraphPad Software ) . RESULTS First , we performed our investigation of PKC - a / b 2 / 2 dou - ble KO mice in nondiabetic and diabetic states to analyze early changes of the renal phenotype in comparison with appropriate WT littermates . Hyperglycemia ( nonfasted values ) persisted in both WT ( 37 . 7 6 4 . 8 mmol / L ) and KO ( 40 . 3 6 5 . 6 mmol / L ) animals 8 weeks after STZ injection as compared with 8 . 6 6 1 . 1 and 10 . 4 6 1 . 2 mmol / L , re - spectively , in the appropriate sham - injected control mice ( Table 1 ) . Because we previously have shown that PKC - a 2 / 2 mice are protected against the development of albuminuria in the diabetic state ( 7 , 8 ) , we then tested albuminuria in our PKC - a / b 2 / 2 mice ( Table 1 ) . After 8 weeks of diabetes , the albumin / creatinine ratio was signi ﬁ cantly increased in the diabetic WT mice with a median of 22 . 0 6 3 . 1 g / mol compared with 3 . 1 6 1 . 9 g / mol in the sham - injected control WT animals ( P , 0 . 001 ) . Notably , the albumin / creatinine ratio was signi ﬁ cantly diminished in hyperglycemic PKC - a / b 2 / 2 mice compared with diabetic WT animals ( 13 . 9 6 3 . 2 g / mol ; P , 0 . 05 ) . However , there was still a notable amount of albuminuria when compared with nondiabetic KO controls ( 7 . 2 6 2 . 8 g / mol ; P , 0 . 05 ) . We previously have suggested that the prevention of albuminuria in STZ - induced diabetic PKC - a 2 / 2 mice is possibly related to diabetes - induced expression changes of the heparan sulfate proteoglycan perlecan ( 7 ) or the slit membrane protein nephrin ( 8 ) . Furthermore , we have shown that suppression of the VEGF system contributes to the prevention of albuminuria in diabetic PKC - a 2 / 2 mice ( 7 ) . We observed only a weak expression level of VEGF , mainly located in podocytes , in nondiabetic study mice ( Fig . 1 A – E ) . Under hyperglycemic conditions , a signi ﬁ cant increase of VEGF was observed in WT animals . Notably , this increase was signi ﬁ cantly reduced in diabetic PKC - a / b 2 / 2 mice . This ﬁ nding was con ﬁ rmed by Western blotting ( data not shown ) . The expressions of perlecan ( Fig . 1 F – J ) and nephrin ( Fig . 1 K – O ) were reduced in the glomeruli of diabetic WT animals , whereas the diabetes - induced loss was prevented in PKC - a / b 2 / 2 mice , as pre - viously described in diabetic PKC - a 2 / 2 mice ( 7 ) . We next studied renal and glomerular hypertrophy as well as extracellular matrix expansion in our PKC - a / b 2 / 2 double KO model because we previously proved pro - tection from ﬁ brotic events in diabetic PKC - b 2 / 2 single KO mice ( 9 ) .

Furthermore , we then analyzed glomerular tuft volume in our PKC - a / b 2 / 2 mouse model compared with appropriate controls . We revealed that in diabetic WT mice , glomerular tuft volume is signi ﬁ cantly increased , whereas PKC - a / b 2 / 2 mice were protected from such changes under hyperglycemic conditions ( Table 1 ) . Additionally , the number of Wilms tumor - 1 – positive podocytes was reduced in diabetic WT mice , but not in diabetic KO mice ( Table 1 ) . To study early structural changes in the kidneys from PKC - a / b 2 / 2 mice , we next performed Masson - Goldner trichrome staining of 8 - week - old animals of all four study groups . The structural analysis revealed glomerular and extracellular matrix expansion in the WT diabetic mice , whereas in PKC - a / b 2 / 2 mice less extracellular matrix was detectable in the diabetic state ( data not shown ) . A pos - sible explanation for these ﬁ ndings is the observation that the pro ﬁ brotic cytokine TGF - b 1 expression was signi ﬁ - cantly upregulated in hyperglycemic WT animals , whereas diabetic PKC - a / b 2 / 2 mice showed a signi ﬁ cantly reduced TGF - b 1 protein expression ( Fig . 2 A – E ) . This ﬁ nding was con ﬁ rmed by Western blotting ( data not shown ) . Consis - tent with the histological alterations and effects on TGF - b 1 upregulation , we found less type IV collagen ( Fig . 2 F – J ) and ﬁ bronectin ( Fig . 2 K – O ) expression in diabetic PKC - a / b 2 / 2 mice , and Sirius red staining ( Fig . 2 P – T ) revealed that the diabetic PKC - a / b 2 / 2 mice had less extracellular matrix between the tubuli than the WT mice . One mechanism involved in diabetic nephropathy is oxi - dative stress , and we analyzed nitrotyrosine as a marker . Under diabetic conditions , nitrotyrosine was markedly upregulated , but it was signi ﬁ cantly reduced in the PKC - a / b 2 / 2 mice , suggesting that some of the bene ﬁ cial effects observed might be attributable to a reduction of oxidative stress ( Fig . 1 P – T ) . To analyze if a pharmacological interventional approach shows a similar bene ﬁ t as observed in the diabetic PKC - a / b 2 / 2 mice , we also performed experimental studies in two independent diabetic rodent models using the known classical PKC inhibitor CGP41251 , which blocks PKC - a and PKC - b isoforms . as well as the PKC - g isoform ( which is , however , only present in neurons ) . First , we performed initial in vivo experiments to determine the dose to be administered to achieve suf ﬁ cient blood concentration . The blood concentration was 100 – 300 nmol / L after 2 – 9 weeks of treatment with 1 mg / kg of CGP41251 , whereas the administration of 3 mg / kg was associated with blood levels of 2 , 000 – 4 , 000 nmol / L , resulting in increased mor - tality in this group . Therefore , we decided to further study administration of 1 mg / kg CGP41251 to prevent the de - velopment of diabetic nephropathy in the STZ model ( Ta - ble 2 ) . Eight weeks of treatment did diminish the occurrence of albuminuria ( Table 2 ) and had a positive effect on the nephrin and perlecan expression ( Fig . 1 ) . VEGF was only slightly modi ﬁ ed . We observed no signi ﬁ - cant effect on renal hypertrophy , and TGF - b 1 expression was only reduced slightly ( Table 2 and Fig . 2 ) . To determine if treatment with CGP41251 could improve already existing diabetic kidney damage , we started treatment after 4 and 12 weeks of diabetes . During the 8 - week treatment period , we observed a signi ﬁ cant im - provement of albuminuria ( Table 2 and Fig . 3 A and B ) , whereas the effect on renal hypertrophy was only mild . Finally , we also tested if CGP41251 also would have an effect in a type 2 diabetic mouse model ( db / db mice ) . We treated db / db mice for a total of 16 weeks . Treatment im - proved albuminuria but , again , had only little effect on renal hypertrophy ( Table 2 and Fig . 3 C ) . Because the renal hypertrophy was only mildly affected , we wondered if CGP41251 is a speci ﬁ c classical PKC in - hibitor . Therefore , we determined the IC50 of CGP41251 for the distinct PKC isoforms . Contrary to the published data , we found that the IC50 for classical PKC isoforms was between 40 and 60 nmol / L , and for novel PKC iso - forms it was between 50 and 100 nmol / L , indicating that CGP41251 can be considered as a pan - PKC inhibitor . DISCUSSION We demonstrate that removal of the two classical PKC - a and PKC - b isoforms has a synergistic effect on experimental TABLE 2 Blood glucose levels and body and kidney weight in untreated and treated 129SV and db / m and db / db mice with diabetes Study group n Last blood glucose ( mmol / L ) Last body weight ( g ) Kidney / body weight ratio ( ‰ ) 24 - h Albuminuria at end of study Treatment start immediately control 15 5 . 2 6 0 . 6 28 . 0 6 2 . 5 1 . 48 6 0 . 13 26 . 9 6 19 . 9 STZ 14 18 . 3 6 4 . 9 ‡ 18 . 8 6 2 . 4 ‡ 1 . 79 6 0 . 24 ‡ 88 . 4 6 53 . 2 † STZ CGP41251 11 25 . 1 6 7 . 7 ‡ § 21 . 2 6 1 . 9 ‡ 1 . 84 6 0 . 30 ‡ 40 . 7 6 34 . 9 § Treatment start after 4 weeks of diabetes control 6 5 . 8 6 0 . 3 30 . 3 6 2 . 9 1 . 2 6 0 . 06 20 . 6 6 8 . 0 control CGP41251 6 6 . 1 6 0 . 6 30 . 8 6 1 . 8 1 . 4 6 0 . 16 17 . 9 6 5 . 5 STZ 11 29 . 5 6 3 . 6 ‡ 18 . 3 6 3 . 1 ‡ 2 . 14 6 0 . 42 ‡ 70 . 4 6 43 . 7 † STZ CGP41251 10 26 . 5 6 4 . 3 ‡ 18 . 9 6 3 . 7 ‡ 1 . 94 6 0 . 38 † 38 . 9 6 24 . 3 * § Treatment start after 12 weeks of diabetes control 7 6 . 0 6 1 . 1 30 . 1 6 2 . 1 1 . 37 6 0 . 11 19 . 0 6 6 . 5 control CGP41251 7 6 . 1 6 0 . 8 31 . 0 6 2 . 9 † 1 . 31 6 0 . 17 17 . 2 6 9 . 9 STZ 12 29 . 2 6 6 . 3 ‡ 21 . 1 6 3 . 1 † 1 . 88 6 0 . 30 ‡ 87 . 5 6 44 . 1 † STZ CGP41251 11 27 . 4 6 5 . 0 ‡ 21 . 3 6 4 . 4 † 1 . 61 6 0 . 15 * 54 . 7 6 42 . 6 * § Treatment start immediately db / m 12 6 . 0 6 0 . 7 28 . 9 6 1 . 4 1 . 30 6 0 . 17 24 . 6 6 9 . 7 db / db 20 20 . 0 6 6 . 9 ‡ 52 . 4 6 5 . 3 ‡ 0 . 78 6 0 . 13 ‡ 98 . 9 6 48 . 2 ‡ db / db CGP41251 14 23 . 5 6 2 . 44 ‡ 57 . 4 6 4 . 7 ‡ 0 . 74 6 0 . 09 ‡ 70 . 0 6 24 . 1 † § Data are presented as mean 6 SD . * P , 0 . 05 , † P , 0 . 01 , and ‡ P , 0 . 001 vs . control or db / m . § P , 0 . 05 vs .

Blocking both isoforms has a bene ﬁ cial effect on the development of renal hypertro - phy and on albuminuria under diabetic conditions . Addi - tionally , we show that pharmaceutical inhibition of these two isoforms has a positive effect on albuminuria . These data extend our own ﬁ ndings from various PKC KO models that two important features of diabetic nephropathy , al - buminuria and glomerular hypertrophy , are differentially regulated via PKC isoform – selective signaling events ( Table 3 ) ( 7 – 12 , 16 ) . We previously have shown that diabetic PKC - b 2 / 2 mice demonstrate reduced renal hypertrophy and diminished high - glucose – induced expression of extracellular matrix ( ECM ) proteins and of the pro ﬁ brotic cytokine TGF - b 1 ( 9 ) , which previously had been demonstrated to be unaltered in diabetic PKC - a 2 / 2 mice ( 7 , 8 ) . However , we also had shown that diabetic PKC - a 2 / 2 mice are protected against the development of albuminuria , possibly because of effects on VEGF expression , a diminished loss of nega - tively charged heparan sulfate proteoglycans or the slit diaphragm protein nephrin ( 7 , 8 ) . Furthermore , we recently characterized the molecular mechanism of the latter as the endocytosis of nephrin is PKC - a – dependent ( 17 ) . These previous studies indicate that a cell - type – speci ﬁ c expres - sion pattern of the various PKC isoforms is pivotal , mainly in such a complex cellular structure as the kidney . There - fore , we suggested that the PKC - b isoform is more impor - tant in the upregulation of TGF - b 1 and for the development of renal hypertrophy and extracellular matrix production under hyperglycemic conditions , whereas PKC - a isoform FIG . 3 .

MURINE DIABETIC NEPHROPATHY 1172 DIABETES , VOL . 62 , APRIL 2013 diabetes . diabetesjournals . org seems to play a critical role in the development of albu - minuria by perpetuating the glomerular ﬁ ltration barrier . Notably , the breakdown of the glomerular ﬁ ltration barrier with development of albuminuria in the diabetic PKC - b 2 / 2 mice did occur , although inhibition of TGF - b 1 was ob - tained by the deletion of the PKC - b isoform . In addition to the described molecular effects of the two classical PKC isoforms a and b , it is noteworthy that both are involved in many intracellular molecular pathways important for the development of diabetes complications . Several authors previously have demonstrated that PKC - a and PKC - b activations are associated with increased NADPH activity and NADPH - dependent superoxide pro - duction ( 14 , 18 ) . Because excessive production of reactive oxygen species has been implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy , this observation might be clinically relevant , and we found that oxidative stress is reduced in PKC - a / b 2 / 2 mice . It also has been demonstrated that ad - vanced glycation end products ( AGEs ) mediate at least some of their damaging effects via PKC - a signaling ( 18 ) . Our experimental data now suggest that it is more promising to inhibit PKC - a and PKC - b simultaneously in the treatment of diabetic nephropathy ; otherwise , impor - tant components of long - term kidney damage ( albumin - uria , interstitial structural changes , or reactive oxygen stress ) would not be suf ﬁ ciently inhibited . Notably , the data obtained from the double KO underline this concept . Albuminuria , however , was not completely abolished . The reason for this observation remains unclear . One possible explanation could be an altered VEGF balance , which may be deleterious to the maintenance of the glomerular ﬁ l - tration barrier , regardless of whether it is up or down ( 19 ) . Generating PKC isoform – selective inhibitors that target the active enzyme has proven to be a challenge ( 6 , 20 , 21 ) . Early PKC inhibitors developed for experimental use , such as staurosporine and 1 - ( 5 - isoquinolinylsulfonyl ) - 2 - methylpiperazine ( H7 ) , were only capable of blocking the activity of all PKCs rather than individual PKC iso - forms ( 22 ) . Staurosporine - like bisindolylmaleimide com - pounds , such as CGP41251 , Go - 6850 , Ro - 31 – 8220 , and UCN - 01 , were subsequently developed , and act at the ATP - binding site of the enzyme ( 23 ) . Notably , the macrocyclic bisindolylmaleimide compound LY333531 ( Ruboxistaurin ; Arxxant ; Eli Lilly , Indianapolis , IN ) was synthesized and previously was shown to be a competitive , reversible in - hibitor of both PKC - b 1 and PKC - b 2 ( 24 , 25 ) . King and colleagues ( 26 ) were the ﬁ rst to hypothesize that the PKC - b isoform primarily is responsible for the glucose - induced effects leading to diabetic microvascular complications . Further evidence for this hypothesis stems from reports that the aforementioned speci ﬁ c PKC - b isoform inhibitor ruboxistaurin ameliorates hyperglycemia - induced changes in the kidney ( 27 – 29 ) . In rats with STZ - induced ( type 1 diabetes model ) and db / db mice ( type 2 diabetes model ) , both characteristic pathological events of diabetic nephropathy , the development of albuminuria and mesangial expansion , could be prevented by the administration of ruboxistaurin ( 28 , 29 ) . Kelly et al . ( 30 ) also demonstrated in STZ - induced diabetic and hypertensive ( mRen - 2 ) rats , a rodent model that is transgenic for the entire mouse renin gene ( Ren - 2 ) , that in vivo inhibition of the PKC - b isoform with ruboxistaurin led to a reduction in renal TGF - b 1 expression and structural injury of the kidney , as well as albuminuria . The expected bene ﬁ ts from preclinical trials have not ( so far ) translated into meaningful outcome improvements in clinical trials . First , a multicenter , double - blind , placebo - controlled study suggested an additive effect of ruboxistaurin compared with placebo in 123 type 2 diabetic patients with proteinuria ( mean albumin / creatinine ratio 764 mg / g ) or near - normal serum creatinine who were already treated optimally with an angiotensin - converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker and intensive glycemic control ( 31 ) . The investigators reported that 32 mg ruboxistaurin daily for up to 1 year resulted in a reduction in urinary albumin / creatinine ratio in the ruboxistaurin group compared with the placebo group . Renal function , examined by estimated glomerular ﬁ ltration rate , was maintained with ruboxistaurin treatment . In contrast , participants in the placebo group had a signi ﬁ cant decline in estimated glomerular ﬁ ltration rate that was within the range reported in recent clinical trials of angiotensin re - ceptor blockers and angiotensin - converting enzyme in - hibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and overt nephropathy ( 31 ) . It is important to note , however , that the reduction in albumin / creatinine ratio compared with the baseline level was not signi ﬁ cant compared with the de - crease achieved by placebo , according to conventional intergroup comparison . Another recent meta - analysis of the three major diabetic retinopathy trials ( PKC - DRS , PKC - DMES , PKC - DRS2 ) demonstrated that kidney outcome rates after 3 years did not differ by treatment assignment , whereas serum creatinine doubling was 6 . 0 % , progression to higher stages of diabetic nephropathy was 3 . 5 % , and decline in glomerular ﬁ ltration rate was ; 3 – 4 mL / min 2 1 / year 2 1 ( 32 ) . Campochiaro et al . ( 33 ) also published an interesting article in 2004 reporting the results of a clinical trial using the PKC inhibitor CGP41251 ( PKC412 ) in diabetic patients with proliferative retinopathy . This trial was a randomized , multicenter , double - masked , parallel - group study in which subjects received placebo ( n = 34 ) or 50 mg / d CGP41251 ( n = 32 ) , 100 mg ( n = 38 ) , or 150 mg / d ( n = 37 ) for up to 3 months . Subjects were 18 to 85 years of age and had retinal thickening . Treatment with high doses of CGP41251 caused a signi ﬁ cant decrease in thickening in the region of greatest thickening and in the fovea , a decrease of the retinal volume , and a small improvement in visual acuity at 3 months compared with baseline in the 100 mg / d CGP41251 group . We therefore tested , in the current study , whether this inhibitor also could prevent the development of diabetic microvascular complications such as experi - mental diabetic nephropathy . We found that the occurrence of albuminuria was prevented and that already existing al - buminuria was reduced by the treatment , but it had only little effects on renal hypertrophy and , at higher doses , an increased mortality . Because we were surprised by this observation , we then tested again the speci ﬁ city of this so - called classical PKC inhibitor and found that , contrary to published data , CGP41251 is a rather unspeci ﬁ c pan - PKC inhibitor ( 15 ) . Interestingly , we previously have demon - strated that deletion of PKC - e in speci ﬁ c KO mice causes development of glomerulosclerosis and albuminuria , even in the nondiabetic state ( 13 ) . We therefore concluded that upregulation of this novel PKC isoform in diabetes mellitus may represent a protective response to injury . ( 13 ) Thus , it is tempting to speculate that we would have been able to demonstrate even clearer results in the current study if CGP41251 were a truly speci ﬁ c PKC - a / b inhibitor that does not interfere with the rather protective PKC e signaling path - way in experimental diabetic nephropathy ( 13 ) . The three - dimensional structures of distinct PKC isoforms have been J . MENNE AND ASSOCIATES diabetes . diabetesjournals . org DIABETES , VOL . 62 , APRIL 2013 1173 identi ﬁ ed , which certainly will provide valuable information for more selective pharmacological drug design ( 6 , 34 ) . In conclusion , we believe that PKC isoform selectivity does occur in vivo and exerts distinct pivotal functions in the development of murine experimental diabetic ne - phropathy . The results from PKC - a / b double KO mice and using the ( pan ) - PKC inhibitor CGP41251 presented within this study suggest that isolated inhibition of the two clas - sical PKC isoforms , a and b , is bene ﬁ cial and that such a dual pharmacological approach should be considered in the treatment of diabetic microvascular complications such as diabetic nephropathy .
