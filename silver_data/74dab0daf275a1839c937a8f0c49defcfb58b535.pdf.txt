We tested if prior infections with seasonal 48 coronaviruses impacted SARS - CoV - 2 infections and related Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome 49 ( MIS ) . 50 Methods : This cross - sectional observational study in Paris hospitals enrolled 739 pauci or 51 asymptomatic children ( HOS group ) plus 36 children with suspected MIS ( MIS group ) . Prevalence , 52 antigen specificity and neutralizing capability of SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies were tested . Antibody 53 frequency and titres against Nucleocapsid ( N ) and Spike ( S ) of the four seasonal coronaviruses ( NL63 , 54 HKU1 , 229E , OC43 ) were measured in a subset of seropositive patients ( 54 SARS - CoV - 2 ( HOS - P 55 subgroup ) and 15 MIS ( MIS - P subgroup ) ) , and in 118 matched SARS - CoV - 2 seronegative patients ( CTL 56 subgroup ) . 57 Findings : SARS - CoV - 2 mean prevalence rate in HOSP children was 11 . 7 % from April 1 to June 1 . 58 Neutralizing antibodies were found in 55·6 % of seropositive children , and their relative frequency 59 increased with time ( up to 100 % by mid - May ) . A majority of MIS children ( 25 / 36 ) were SARS - CoV - 2 60 seropositive , of which all tested ( n = 15 ) had neutralizing antibodies . On average , seropositive MIS 61 children had higher N and S1 SARS - CoV - 2 titres as compared to HOS children . Patients from HOS - P , 62 MIS - P , and CTL subgroups had a similar prevalence of antibodies against the four seasonal HCoVs ( 66·9 63 - 100 % ) . The level of anti - SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies was not significantly different in children who had 64 prior seasonal coronavirus infection . 65 Interpretation : Prior infection with HCoVs does not prevent SARS - CoV - 2 infection and related MIS in 66 children . Children develop neutralizing antibodies after SARS - CoV - 2 infection . 67 68 All rights reserved . No reuse allowed without permission .

As those asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic children are underdiagnosed and 71 their viral loads are comparable to those of adults , they may act as an asymptomatic reservoir for the 72 spread of the virus . One explanation of the difference between the adult and the pediatric infectious 73 profile might be that infection with seasonal human coronaviruses , which is very frequent from a very 74 young age , could lead to cross protective immunity . We searched in PubMed , MedRxiv and BioRxiv 75 for publications from inception to June 15 , 2020 , using the terms “COVID - 19 , SARS - CoV - 2 , children , 76 serology , Kawasaki , Corona Virus” . 77 Added value of this study 78 SARS - CoV - 2 mean prevalence rate was 11 . 7 % from April 1 to June 1 and neutralizing antibodies were 79 found in 55 % of the tested seropositive children . Among patients with a Multisystem Inflammatory 80 Syndrome , Kawasaki - like disease , 70 % were SARS - CoV - 2 seropositive and had neutralizing antibodies . 81 COVID - 19 and MIS attack rates , and anti - SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies titres were not significantly impacted 82 by prior seasonal coronavirus infection . 83 Implications of all the available evidence 84 Prior infection by seasonal coronaviruses does not prevent SARS - CoV - 2 infection and associated 85 Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in children As antibodies against seasonal coronaviruses are 86 very frequent and as these viruses circulate efficiently in human populations every winter , our results 87 question to what extent the concept of herd immunity based on circulating antibodies can be applied 88 to seasonal coronaviruses and possibly SARS - CoV - 2 . 89 90 91 92 All rights reserved .

Observations indicate that children are 95 less likely to develop the disease and that the clinical course of COVID - 19 in children is less severe than 96 in adults 2 – 4 . Accordingly , children represent only 0 . 6 - 2 . 3 % of confirmed cases in China and 0 . 8 - 5 . 2 % 97 outside China outside context of household 2 , 5 , 6 . As asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic children are 98 underdiagnosed , and their viral loads are comparable to those of adults , children may act as an 99 asymptomatic reservoir for the spread of the virus to their adult and elderly relatives 7 , 8 , albeit with 100 low efficacy 9 . Children’s susceptibility to infection might also be low 5 and the paediatric cohort may 101 represent a pool of “immune naïve” population . Differences in susceptibility profiles for children and 102 adults might be driven by infections with seasonal human coronaviruses ( HCoVs ) , which are very 103 frequent at a very young age 10 , and could lead to cross - protective immunity in children . This may be 104 mediated either by cross - binding or cross - neutralizing antibodies 11 , or by T cell responses that target 105 epitopes shared by SARS - CoV - 2 and HCoVs 12 , 13 . Indeed , it was recently shown that CD4 + T cells of 106 unexposed subjects ( sampled before the pandemic ) recognized SARS - CoV - 2 . 107 Despite a low frequency of respiratory symptoms , cases of Multisystem Inflammatory 108 Syndrome ( MIS ) have been reported in children that were infected by SARS - CoV - 2 or were in contact 109 with COVID - 19 patients 14 , 15 . MIS shares similarities with classic Kawasaki disease but displays different 110 prominent clinical signs including cardiogenic shock or myocarditis 15 . As for other post infectious 111 diseases 16 , it is possible that a low antibody response to SARS - CoV - 2 , or cross - reactive antibodies 112 without any neutralizing capability , facilitate immune - dependent enhancement following re - 113 exposure , potentiated by a specific genetic background 17 , 18 . Interestingly , a domain of the SARS - CoV - 114 2 spike protein which binds with high affinity to T cells may act as a super antigen , and trigger 115 excessive adaptive immune responses 19 . 116 The aim of this study was to analyse the impact of endemic seasonal coronaviruses on SARS - 117 CoV - 2 infection in children .

To measure if prior infections with HCoVs ( detected by antibody responses 119 against two major antigens , S and N ) conferred protection towards SARS - CoV - 2 infection , we analysed 120 their frequency in SARS - CoV - 2 positive children as compared to SARS - CoV - 2 negative matched 121 controls . We also analysed SARS - CoV - 2 and seasonal HCoVs humoral responses of patients with MIS 122 regarding antibody targets and functional neutralizing activity . Our study is the first to analyse in depth 123 the typology of humoral responses to SARS - CoV - 2 in children , and provides evidence that prior 124 infections by seasonal coronaviruses has no significant impact on SARS - CoV - 2 infection or related MIS 125 disease in children . 126 127 128 All rights reserved .

Sera were also collected from March 1 to March 134 31 from patients consulting for regular follow - up or hospitalized in emergency in one of the hospitals 135 ( Necker Enfants Malades Hospital ) . The definition of a suspected case for COVID - 19 was based on 136 recommendations from the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control ( ECDC ) 20 . We also 137 included in this study during the same period patients presenting with a MIS disease , as defined by 138 the American Heart Association 21 . 139 We recorded the history of suspected COVID - 19 cases based on a standardized study - specific form . 140 We collected data on clinical symptoms consistent with COVID - 19 occurring from December 2019 until 141 up to 7 days before enrolment . Demographic information , relevant epidemiological history ( e . g . 142 international travel or contact with an infected person or a suspected case ) , comorbidities , reasons 143 for hospitalization were collected . 144 Ethics 145 The local Ethics ( CERAPHP Paris V ) approved this study ( IRB registration : # 00011928 ) . Patients and / or 146 their parents / guardians were informed about the study 147 Serological tests 148 For SARS - CoV - 2 prevalence , we used a LIPS ( Luciferase Immunoprecipitation System ) test as 149 previously reported 22 , which identifies antibodies ( Ab ) targeted to the S1 and S2 domains of the Spike 150 ( S ) and to the Nucleoprotein ( N ) . For the neutralization assay we used a viral pseudotype - based assay 151 and a neutralization test using live SARS - CoV - 2 . In a fraction of samples , we assessed by LIPS tests , 152 antibodies to the nucleoprotein and to the full spike ectodomain in a pre - fusion conformation for 153 SARS - CoV - 2 , and the four human coronaviruses ( HKU1 , NL63 , OC43 , and 229E ) .

One hundred 172 six ( 13·6 % ) were below 15 years of age . The reason for consultation or hospitalization was regular 173 follow - up for 58 % , surgery for 11·7 % and medical emergency for 15 % ( HOS population ) . Among those , 174 17 patients ( 2·1 % ) were hospitalized for neurological disorders including encephalitis ( n = 4 ) , 175 cerebellitis ( n = 5 ) , polyradiculoneuritis ( n = 7 ) , and labyrinthitis ( n = 1 ) . Thirty - six other patients ( 4·6 % ) 176 presented with a MIS and among those , 25 were hospitalized in Intensive Care Unit because of signs 177 of shock , and 28 developed myocarditis . 178 The apparent prevalence of seropositive children was in the range 10 % - 15 % between 6 th April and 179 1 st June , except on the week starting 11 th May where it reached 27 % . The patients with MIS were 180 mainly detected from the last week of April to mid - May ( Figure 2 ) . The seropositive patients with 181 neurological disorders were hospitalized over the whole study period . 182 Table 1 presents the demographic and clinical characteristics of 594 SARS - CoV - 2 seronegative patients 183 and 172 seropositive patients enrolled between 1 st March to 1 st June . The seropositive children 184 consisted of patients hospitalized for MIS ( MIS - P ; n = 25 ) or for any other reason ( HOS - P ; n = 147 ) . 185 The comparison between seronegative and seropositive patients among the whole cohort of HOS and 186 MIS populations did not show any significant differences for age , sex ratio , reasons for hospitalization 187 and main comorbidities , apart for SARS - CoV - 2 seropositive MIS patients , who did not report 188 underlying chronic diseases and were all hospitalized in emergency units . There was a significantly 189 higher frequency of household contact with suspected SARS - CoV - 2 infection ( without testing ) among 190 the seropositive patients . History of contact with a suspected COVID - 19 household significantly 191 increased the risk for positive serology , even in case of asymptomatic infection ( OR 2 . 25 , 95 % CI [ 1 . 3 ; 192 3 . 9 ] ) . Among the 25 contacts of seropositive patients , 23 were parents . 193 All rights reserved . No reuse allowed without permission .

More than 70 % of them ( 121 out of the 172 ) did not report any history 195 consistent with COVID - 19 during the preceding weeks . The only symptoms that were marginally but 196 significantly reported in the previous months in seropositive children were headache , shortness of 197 breath and rhino - pharyngitis . Neurological disorders were significantly more frequent in the 198 seropositive group ( 13 children out of 17 ) . 199 2 - Profiling SARS - CoV - 2 antibody responses in HOS - P and MIS - P patients 200 HOS - P patients Ab profile was characterized by a dominant S2 response compared to responses to S1 , 201 N and to the full S ectodomain ( Figure 3 ) . The HOS - P children with neurological symptoms showed N , 202 S1 and S2 responses similar to those of the HOS - P group without neurological symptoms 203 ( Supplemental Figure S4 ) and were analysed together . 204 MIS - P patients showed a distinct Ab profile directed against N , S1 and S2 altogether ( Figure 4 ) . Levels 205 of N and S1 Abs to SARS - CoV - 2 were significantly higher in the MIS - P than in the HOS - P group ( Figure 206 3C - D ) . 207 3 - Neutralization activity of the Ab 208 To investigate the neutralization activity , we first performed a pseudo - neutralization assay in the 209 subset of 54 HOS - P and 15 MIS - P patients ( Figure 1 ) . Overall , 55·6 % of HOS - P and 100 % of MIS - P 210 children showed a neutralizing activity . Interestingly , the fraction of HOS - P children whose Abs 211 displayed a pseudo - neutralizing activity ( PNT + ) increased with time ( Figure 2B ) , from 18 % to 38 % 212 during March and April to 100 % at the beginning of May . For a fraction of these children , we 213 investigated the correspondence between PNT and live SARS - CoV - 2 neutralizing activity determined 214 in a plaque reduction test ( PRNT ) ( Table S6 ) . All tested sera positive in PNT ( n = 28 ) were PRNT + and 2 215 out of the 11 PNT - negative sera were also PRNT + . In total , 73·7 % of HOS - P tested sera showed a 216 neutralizing activity . Neutralizing titres of PNT + and PRNT + sera of MIS - P patients were similar to those 217 of HOS - P patients ( Figure 3 ) . 218 All rights reserved . No reuse allowed without permission .

They were also similar 223 for HKU - 1 , 229E and NL63 in the MIS - P group , whereas Abs to OC43 N were more frequent in the MIS - 224 P group ( 73 % ) than in the CTL group ( 39 . 4 % ) , which was not paralleled by the anti - S response that was 225 near 100 % in the two groups ( Table 2 ) . 226 We reasoned that prior infection with SARS - CoV - 2 , identified by antibody responses , could induce 227 cross - reactive immune effectors , like CD4 + and CD8 + T cells and neutralizing antibodies . This would 228 diminish or impair SARS - CoV - 2 antibody responses , which should therefore be lower in patients with 229 high anti - HCoV Ab levels . Alternatively , previous HCoV infections could prime the immune system 230 resulting , upon SARS - CoV - 2 infection , in a boost of the antibody response against shared epitopes or 231 in facilitation of infection . Such boost should lead to higher anti - SARS - CoV - 2 Ab levels in HCoV positive 232 patients . There was no significant difference between HOS - P and CTL patients regarding antibody 233 levels to the four seasonal HCoVs ( Figure 3 ) . This demonstrates that humoral responses between 234 seasonal coronaviruses and SARS - CoV - 2 were not related . This is confirmed by the PCA analysis which 235 showed that the patient groups ( HOS - P , MIS - P and CTL ) were only clustered by SARS - COV - 2 Abs and 236 not by seasonal HCoV Abs . ( Figure 4 ) . This suggests that the risk of SARS - CoV - 2 infection and of related 237 MIS disease were not influenced by prior seasonal HCoV infection . In support to this observation , there 238 was an association , for each virus , between all S and N antibody titres within each of the three groups 239 of patients ( CTL , HOS - P and MIS - P ) . This correlation was stronger for SARS - CoV - 2 than for seasonal 240 HCoVs . ( Supplemental Figures S5 and S6 ) Importantly , there was no significant association between 241 SARS - CoV - 2 and seasonal HCoV quantitative Ab responses ( Supplemental Figures S5 and S6 ) . MIS - P 242 and HOS - P groups did not differ for Abs titers against seasonal HCoVs , except for OC43 - N Abs that 243 were increased in MIS - P children , but this tendency was not confirmed by the OC43 - S Ab response 244 ( Figure 3A - B ) . This was coherent with the Abs prevalence study ( Table 2 ) . . 245 All rights reserved . No reuse allowed without permission .

We enrolled nearly 800 children 249 during the first three months of the COVID - 19 epidemic in Paris . From April to May , the prevalence 250 rate of Abs against SARS - CoV - 2 was in the range of 10 - 15 % . We noticed an outlier peak of incidence 251 during the week of 11 May , which was likely associated with an increase of vigilance of physicians 252 following the information of severe clinical presentations in children . This prevalence rate is in 253 contrast with previous epidemiological cohort studies , based on RT - PCR , where children represent 254 less than 2 % of diagnosed cases 24 - 23 . These numbers are compatible with the prevalence estimated in 255 Paris 24 despite the specificity of the population of children recruited in university hospitals . Here , in a 256 large cohort of children less than 15 years old , we demonstrate that ( i ) a substantial proportion of 257 children can become infected and ( ii ) the risk is not related to age . In nearly 15 % of the cases , a contact 258 with a parent suspected of COVID - 19 was identified , which increased by 2·5 fold the risk to be infected . 259 Very importantly , more than 50 % of the seropositive children did not report any symptoms , a 260 proportion similar to that recently reported in adults 25 . The reminders reported mild and non - specific 261 symptoms such as headache , rhino - pharyngitis and shortness of breath . This confirms previously 262 published data showing that COVID - 19 is less severe in children than in adults 26 . The largest study in 263 children published so far that described SARS - CoV - 2 infection in 2 , 143 Chinese children also reported 264 asymptomatic infection or mild symptoms such as fever , cough , a sore throat , sneezing , myalgia and 265 fatigue 27 . Altogether , these results and ours underline that most children remain undiagnosed 266 because of asymptomatic infections , which makes them potential drivers of virus spread 28 . 267 This is to our knowledge the first study profiling the humoral immune response in children 268 experiencing pauci - symptomatic infection by SARS - CoV - 2 . We showed that around half of SARS - CoV - 269 2 positive sera present a significant neutralizing activity based on two independent assays ( based on 270 lentivirus pseudo - typed with the SARS - CoV - 2 spike or based on live virus ) . Interestingly , this rate 271 All rights reserved . No reuse allowed without permission .

As reported by others 29 , this suggests that appearance of neutralizing antibodies 273 is delayed relative to initial seroconversion . This is in contrast to severe COVID - 19 forms 22 , 30 , where 274 neutralizing antibody responses against the immunodominant S viral protein are elicited as soon as 275 after two weeks of infection at higher frequency and titres . Importantly , considering these data , it 276 must be underlined that quantitative correlates of protection are currently unknown , which makes it 277 difficult to relate the neutralizing titres to a clinically relevant effect . 278 To investigate reasons explaining decreased severity of SARS - CoV - 2 infection in children , we studied 279 the impact of prior infections with seasonal HCoVs on the risk of infection by SARS - CoV - 2 . Antibodies 280 were considered as an evidence of past infection by HCoVs , the intensity of the antibody response 281 reflecting partly the degree of replication within the host . However , this represents a limitation as 282 cases of infection have been reported to be seronegative as revealed by isolated T - cell responses 31 . 283 Seasonal HCoVs include alphacoronaviruses ( 229E and NL63 ) and betacoronaviruses lineage A ( OC43 284 and HKU1 ) , which primarily replicate in the respiratory tract and mostly cause common colds 32 . These 285 viruses show a worldwide distribution and multiple HCoV infections in various combinations are 286 common 10 , 32 – 34 , 35 . Infection takes place in very early childhood and seroprevalence studies show very 287 high prevalence rates 36 , up to 100 % in adult populations 10 , 37 , 38 . It is therefore very likely that infection 288 by HCoVs preceded infection by SARS - CoV - 2 in our cohort . Previous seasonal HCoV infections could 289 have an impact on SARS - CoV - 2 replication . Indeed , antibodies are unlikely to act as primary effectors 290 of protection , as there is no or very low 11 cross neutralization between these coronaviruses , but 291 antibodies serve as an indicator of underlying cellular responses . We found no evidence of cross - 292 protective immunity linked to previous infection by seasonal HCoVs . First , similar seasonal HCoV 293 prevalence was found in SARS - CoV - 2 positive versus negative patients . Second , on a quantitative side , 294 there was no significant correlation between SARS - CoV - 2 and any HCoV antibody titres , whatever the 295 antigen considered ( S or N ) . On the contrary , the level of SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies to N and S were 296 correlated , which corresponds to a good internal control . This was also the case for the N and S 297 responses for each HCoV , but to a lesser extent . We hypothesized that multiple infections by seasonal 298 All rights reserved .

When analysing the S and N responses to HCoVs , we found no obvious difference in N to S 301 correlations in CTL patients as compared to the HOS - P group , suggesting that infection with SARS - CoV - 302 2 did not significantly boost pre - existing antibody responses to HCoVs N and S . 303 This lack of HCoV / SARS - CoV - 2 cross - protection contrasts with the recent demonstration of pre - 304 existing immune effectors recognizing SARS - CoV - 2 in subjects sampled before the SARS - CoV - 2 305 pandemic . Moreover , a very sensitive cytometric assay reported frequent low levels of cross - reacting 306 anti - S IgGs , mainly targeting the SARS - CoV - 2 S2 domain of the spike 11 . Although those Abs neutralized 307 entry of SARS - CoV - 2 S - pseudo - typed lentiviruses in HEK - 293T cells mediated by the spike protein , the 308 clinical relevance of the SARS - CoV - 2 pseudo - neutralisation test is questionable , because the 309 mechanism of entry did not involve the ACE2 receptor of the virus . Moreover , T - helper cells detected 310 in healthy subjects also recognized the C - terminal part of S ( that contains the S2 subunit ) but not the 311 receptor - binding domain ( RBD ) which belongs to S1 13 . In contrast , our results clearly show that cross - 312 reactive antibodies directed against endemic seasonal HCoVs and underlying cross - reacting CD4 + T - 313 cells do not seem to confer any significant protection against SARS - CoV - 2 infection . This could be 314 explained by low identity between coronaviruses of important targets such as the RBD . Importantly , 315 this also suggests that potentially cross - reactive CD8 + T cells , which should be elicited upon seasonal 316 HCoV infections as is the case following SARS - CoV - 2 infection 39 , are not able to significantly contribute 317 to protection against SARS - CoV - 2 infection . 318 We analysed the SARS - CoV - 2 Ab profile in 25 MIS cases associated with a positive SARS - CoV - 2 Ab 319 response . We found higher S1 and N responses , but not an increased neutralizing capacity as 320 compared to HOS - P patients who experienced an asymptomatic or pauci - symptomatic infection 321 ( Figure 2A ) . This was not the case for the beta - ( OC43 ) or alpha - ( 229E and NL63 ) coronaviruses Ab 322 responses , suggesting that the increased SARS - CoV - 2 response is not a non - specific feature triggered 323 by inflammation . Furthermore , the lack of cross - reactivity between anti - S1 Abs of the different 324 All rights reserved . No reuse allowed without permission .

As a whole , our data do not support that previous HCoV infection facilitates SARS - 326 CoV - 2 infection and MIS - related disease . 327 Neutralizing tests for the four seasonal HCoVs were not available but some extrapolation can be done 328 based on SARS - CoV - 2 neutralization and LIPS results , because equivalent LIPS tests were used for all 329 viruses . As the SARS - CoV - 2 results show that up to 100 % of LIPS positive sera sampled one to two 330 months post - infection had neutralizing activity , it can be anticipated that most HCoV positive sera 331 would also neutralize corresponding HCoVs . This means that , in a perspective of herd immunity , most 332 of the general population would have antibodies neutralizing seasonal HCoVs , among other immune 333 effectors . As common colds due to seasonal HCoVs are experienced repeatedly , this leads to 334 questioning whether coronavirus immune responses induce a long - term clinically protective response . 335 Our results therefore pose a doubt regarding the humoral protective response against SARS - CoV - 2 in 336 a perspective of herd immunity , even when the prevalence of antibodies will be high in the population . 337 The strengths of the study are the high number of well documented paediatric cases including MIS 338 cases and the extensive exploration of Ab responses to SARS - CoV - 2 , their neutralizing activity , and the 339 correlation with seasonal HCoV immune responses . We acknowledge that infection rates are probably 340 biased in this cohort of hospitalized children , despite the fact that we focused as much as possible on 341 regular follow - up or COVID - 19 unrelated emergencies . In this cohort , we observed no correlation 342 between the Ab responses against SARS - CoV - 2 and seasonal HCoVs . Although cellular and local 343 immune defenses were not directly tested , our results do not provide evidence for cross - protective 344 immunity or facilitation linked to previous infections by seasonal HCoVs on the risk of developing a 345 SARS - CoV - 2 infection or a MIS disease once infected . 346 In conclusion , our results show that 11 . 7 % of children admitted in Parisian hospitals have Abs against 347 SARS - CoV - 2 and that these Abs are able to neutralize SARS - CoV - 2 in vitro . As seasonal HCoVs circulate 348 efficiently in the human population despite very high antibody prevalence , our results point to the 349 limits of herd immunity applied to seasonal coronaviruses and maybe SARS - CoV - 2 . 350 All rights reserved .
