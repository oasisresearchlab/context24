A total of 200 students ranging in age from 10 to 16 years were tested using a questionnaire that required them to decide on the smallest / biggest frac - tion , to order a set of given fractions and to justify their responses . Students’ responses were grouped in categories that revealed three main explanatory frameworks within which frac - tions seem to be interpreted . The ﬁrst explanatory framework , emerging directly from the initial theory of natural numbers , is that fraction consists of two independent numbers . The second considers fractions as parts of a whole . Only in the third explanatory framework , students were able to understand the relation between numerator and denominator and to consider that fractions can be smaller , equal or even bigger than the unit . # 2004 Elsevier Ltd .

Introduction The purpose of the paper is to investigate the development of students’ under - standing of the numerical value of fractions and to evaluate the usefulness of approaching this question from a conceptual change point of view . The conceptual change theoretical framework that will be adopted in the present study is the one developed by Vosniadou ( 1994 , 2001 , 2002 ) in her attempts to explain how students develop science concepts . The key deﬁnitional elements of this theoretical framework to conceptual change are the following : (cid:1) Corresponding author . Tel . : + 30 - 210 - 7275506 ; fax : + 30 - 210 - 7275504 .

Sometimes the acquisition of new information requires the radical reorganization of what is already known . ( b ) Learning that requires the reorganization of existing knowledge structures is more diﬃcult and time consuming than learning that can be accomplished through enrichment . Moreover , it is likely that in the process of reorganization students will create misconceptions . ( c ) Many misconceptions are synthetic models that reveal students’ attempts to assimilate the new information to their existing knowledge base . In the case of astronomy , Vosniadou and her colleagues ( Vosniadou , 1994 ; Vosniadou & Brewer , 1992 , 1994 ) have argued that the information that the earth is a sphere rotating around its axis and revolving around the sun in a heliocentric solar system is very diﬀerent from young children’s initial understanding of the earth as a ﬂat motionless , physical object supported by ground or water and loca - ted in the center of the universe . Cross - cultural developmental studies of children’s representations of the earth reveal several synthetic models of the earth , such as the model that the earth is round like disc , or that it is a hollow sphere with people liv - ing inside it on ﬂat ground . These models reveal children’s gradual attempts to reconcile the scientiﬁc information that the earth is a sphere with their initial model of a ﬂat , supported and motionless earth . We believe that the conceptual change approach has implications for under - standing the development of the concept of fraction . Many researchers coming either from developmental psychology or mathematics education have noticed that at least some of the diﬃculties children have in understanding fractions could be explained to result from a conﬂict between the new information and their prior knowledge ( e . g . Carpenter , 1988 ; De Corte , Greer , & Verschaﬀel , 1996 ; De Corte , Verschaﬀel , & Pauwels , 1990 ; Fischbein , Deri , Nello , & Marino , 1985 ; Greeno , 1991 ; Lehtinen , Merenluoto , & Kasanen , 1997 ; Resnick & Ford , 1981 ; Resnick et al . , 1989 ; Resnick and Omanson , 1987 ) . In the speciﬁc area of fractions , Chi and Slotta ( 1994 ) have argued that fractions represent a case of a concept the acqui - sition of which requires ontological change . This proposal has become more explicit by Hartnett and Gelman ( 1998 ) . The latter , following earlier research ( Behr , Harel , Post , & Lesh , 1992 ; Fischbein et al . , 1985 ; Gallistel & Gelman , 1992 ; Greer , 1992 ) , show that one of the reasons why the mathematical notion of frac - tion is systematically misrepresented is because it is not consistent with the count - ing principles that apply to natural numbers . They conclude that early knowledge about number may in fact serve as a barrier to learning about fractions , given chil - dren’s constructivist tendency to distort the new information ( about fraction ) to ﬁt their counting - based number theory ( Hartnett and Gelman , 1998 ) . The purpose of the present experiment was to further investigate this proposal , looking at students much older than the ones tested by Hartnett and Gelman ( 1998 ) , in an eﬀort to understand how students gradually overcome the barriers imposed by their knowledge of natural numbers and develop the concept of frac - tion under the inﬂuence of systematic instruction . S . Stafylidou , S . Vosniadou / Learning and Instruction 14 ( 2004 ) 503 – 518 504 Building on the work of previous researchers ( Behr et al . , 1992 ; Fischbein et al . , 1985 ; Hartnett & Gelman , 1998 ; Ohlsson , 1988 ) , we tried to specify exactly how the explanatory framework for natural numbers , well developed by the age of 10 ( which represented the younger students in our sample ) diﬀers from the explana - tory framework for fraction . Table 1 shows some of these key diﬀerences . First , fractions diﬀer in their symbolic representation from natural numbers ( one number versus two cardinal numbers separated by a line ) . Second , with respect to ordering , fractions diﬀer from natural numbers in that one cannot use counting - based algorithms for ordering them . Fractions do not have unique successors ; there are inﬁ - nitely many numbers between any two fractions . Third , with respect to the unit , while the unit is the smallest natural number , there is no ‘‘smallest’’ rational number . Finally , as Table 1 shows , operations ( addition , subtraction , multiplication and division ) on natural numbers diﬀer in important ways from operations performed on fractions . The investigation of these diﬀerences is not among the purposes of the present study . The hypothesis of the experiment was that the presuppositions of the explanatory framework of natural numbers will inhibit the acquisition of fractions , causing system - atic misconceptions . These misconceptions can be interpreted as attempts on the part of the students to assimilate the new information into their existing conceptual structures . 2 . Method 2 . 1 . Participants Two hundred students participated in this study : 40 ﬁfth graders ( mean age 10 years and 7 months ) ; 40 sixth graders ( mean age 11 years and 5 months ) ; 40 Table 1 Diﬀerences between natural numbers and fractions Numerical value Natural number Fraction Symbolic representation One number ( presupposition of discreteness ) Two numbers and a line ( presupposition of density ) Ordering Supported by the natural numbers’ sequence ( counting on ) Not supported by the natural numbers’ sequence Existence of a successor or a preceding number There is no unique successor or a unique preceding number No number between two diﬀerent numbers Inﬁnity Relationship to the unit The unit is the smallest number No unique smallest number Operations Addition – subtraction Supported by the natural numbers’ sequence Not supported by the natural numbers’ sequence Multiplication Multiplication makes the number bigger Multiplication makes the number either bigger or smaller Division Division makes the number smaller Division makes the number either smaller or bigger 505 S .

The students were approximately equally divided between boys and girls and came from middle class public schools in the area of Thessaloniki . 2 . 2 . Questionnaire The questionnaire was designed to examine the development of children’s ideas about the numerical value of a fraction . The questions were divided in two sets . In the ﬁrst set , students were asked to write the smallest and biggest fraction they could think of and justify their answers ( Table 2 ) . In the second set , they were asked to order and compare fractions of diﬀerent kinds ( Table 4 ) . 2 . 3 . Procedure The questionnaire was administered to groups of 10 students by one of the experimenters in their school . The students completed the questionnaire in the presence of the experimenter and were free to discuss with her any clariﬁcation problems they may have had in answering the questions . 3 . Results 3 . 1 . Set I : smallest / biggest fraction Students’ responses in the ﬁrst set of questions were grouped into six categories ( shown in Table 2 ) based on the examples they gave , the justiﬁcations of their responses , and whether they made reference to inﬁnity . The students who were grouped in Category 1 , usually focused on the size of the numerator to compare the given fractions . They seemed to believe that the value of a fraction increases when the numbers that comprise it ( either the numerator or the denominator ) increase . They gave no indication that the fractions they gave as the biggest ( especially in the case where the numerator was equal to the denominator ) equalled the whole unit . Examples can be found in Table 2 . The main idea behind students’ responses classiﬁed in Category 2 , was that the value of a fraction increases when the numbers that comprise it ( either the numerator or the denominator ) decrease . For example , according to a ﬁfth grader , ‘‘the smal - lest fraction is 90 / 950 , because it has big numbers and the bigger the numbers it has the smaller it is’’ , while the biggest fraction is ‘‘1 / 2 , because the smaller the numbers a fraction has the bigger it is’’ . Category 3 was diﬀerent from the Categories 1 and 2 in three basic respects . First , the biggest fractions the children gave as examples did not consist of that impressively big or small numbers . Usually the biggest fraction had just a bigger numerator than the smallest fraction they gave as examples ( i . e . 9 / 10 compared to 1 / 10 ) . Second , students’ explanations made reference to part / whole relationships . The most common interpretation was that the fraction is part of a unit ( i . e . the pieces of a pie or a cake ) . Third , the smallest fraction they chose always had a S . Stafylidou , S .

The main idea behind Category 3 is that a fraction is a part of a whole and that the value of a fraction increases as the size of the numerator approximates the size of the denominator . Categories 4 , 5 and 6 diﬀered from the previous in two basic respects . First , the biggest fraction was an improper fraction . Second , they either used the unit as a point of reference , or interpreted the fraction as the quotient of the numerator div - ided by the denominator . More speciﬁcally , in Category 4 , the students for the ﬁrst time conceptualized the biggest fraction to be the fraction whose numerator is a bigger number than the denominator . In Categories 5 and 6 , we had the appear - ance of the notion of inﬁnity , ﬁrst with respect to the biggest fraction ( Category 5 ) and then also with respect to the smallest fraction ( Category 6 ) . Category 7 included all the mixed responses that could not be categorized in an internally con - sistent category . Table 3 presents the frequency / percentage of students distributed in the various categories described above . As expected , responses that belonged to Category 1 decreased with grade while responses that mentioned inﬁnity ( Categories 5 and 6 ) increased with age . The Kruskal – Wallis test showed grade to be a statistically sig - niﬁcant factor ( v 2 ð 4 Þ ¼ 20 : 21 , p < 0 : 001 ) . Comparing the means between the ﬁve age groups of the participants , it was obvious that the older students were grouped in categories that were closest to the scientiﬁc deﬁnition of fraction . Finally the results of a Mann – Whitney test showed no gender diﬀerence ( z ¼ (cid:3) 2 : 493 , p < 0 : 05 ) . 3 . 2 . Set II : comparison of fractions Using similar criteria as those used in Set I students’ , responses in Set II were grouped into ﬁve categories , shown in Table 4 . Category 1 was divided in three subcategories . What was common in these three subcategories was that the stu - dents ordered the fractions either on the basis of the size of the numerator only or of the denominator only . Subcategory 1a included responses in which the ordering of fractions was made usually on the basis of the size of the numerator . The underlying common belief was that when the numerator of a fraction increases , the fraction itself increases ( ignoring whether the fractions in comparison had diﬀerent denominators ) . These students always considered the unit as the smallest of all fractions , in the third question . The students who ordered the fractions also on the basis of the size of the numerator but considered the unit as the biggest of all fractions , in the third ques - tion , were grouped in Subcategory 1b . In this category , the fraction was interpreted as two individual natural numbers whose value increases as they increase but never exceeds the unit . Category 2 included the students who , contrary to Category 1 , believed that as long as the numbers forming a fraction decrease , the value of the fraction increases S . Stafylidou , S .

In the same category , we also grouped the responses of children who ordered the numbers as above , although they inter - preted the fraction as part of a unit . These students compared the parts a fraction represents—the pieces—and mentioned that the smaller the parts in which a unit is divided , the bigger the fraction is . This interpretation of the fraction is compatible with their belief that a fraction is a part of a unit ; therefore , it is always smaller than the unit . Category 3 included responses that gave the correct ordering of the fractions with the exception of the unit . Some of our participants ordered the fractions cor - rectly , but put the unit in the beginning believing that it is smaller than any frac - tion . These students were grouped in Subcategory 3a . Others put the unit at the end , saying that it is bigger than all fractions . They were grouped in Subcategory 3b . Students who gave the correct ordering of all the fractions , as well as the unit , were grouped in Category 4 . The processes they used to do so included rules of comparison of fractions , interpretation of the fractions as parts of a whole unit , and conversion of the fractions and the unit to fractions with a common denomi - nator . They also used the unit as a point of reference for comparing fractions , and interpreted of the fraction as the quotient of two numbers . Table 5 shows the frequency / percentage of students’ responses in the various categories . As can be seen , 22 % of our participants expressed the idea that the value of a fraction increases as the size of the numbers of the fraction increase ( Category 1 ) . This response was mostly present in the Primary school children and declined in the High school and Lyceum students . The number of students that ordered the fractions and the unit correctly in all the questions increased in the High school and the Lyceum , as expected . The results of the Kruskal – Wallis test showed that there is a statistically signiﬁ - cant eﬀect of grade ( v 2 ð 4 Þ ¼ 13 : 62 , p < 0 : 01 ) , while the Mann – Whitney test showed that gender does not diﬀerentiate the answers of students ( z ¼ (cid:3) 2 : 2 , p < 0 : 05 ) . 3 . 3 . Explanatory frameworks for the numerical value of a fraction As is apparent from the categories of responses , a large number of students , particularly in the lower grades , were guided by the belief that the numerical value of a fraction was represented by two independent natural numbers . We called this the Explanatory Framework of Fraction as Two Independent Natural Numbers and we assigned in this explanatory framework all students whose responses were consist - ently categorized in Response Categories 1 and 2 in Set I , and in Response Cate - gories 1 , 2 and 3 in Set II . Students’ responses in this explanatory framework formed two subcategories : Subcategory A1 was guided by the beliefs that ( a ) The numerical value of a fraction increases when either the numerator or the denominator increase and ( b ) The unit is the smallest natural number , therefore , it is smaller than any fraction . Subcategory A2 was guided by the belief that ‘‘ in fractions the smaller is the bigger ’’ . We interpreted this belief as a transitory phase in the process of 511 S . Stafylidou , S .

The second Explanatory Framework we identiﬁed seemed to be guided by the belief that A Fraction is a Part of a Whole . In this explanatory framework , the chil - dren face the numerator and the denominator of a fraction as two numbers con - nected with a relationship of part / whole of a natural object ( which they consider to be the unit of reference ) . In this explanatory framework , we assigned all stu - dents who belonged to Response Categories 3 and 4 in Set I , and Response Cate - gories 4 and 5 in Set II . This explanatory framework was again divided in three subcategories : In Subcategory B1 : Naı¨ve Part of a Unit , we observed that the stu - dents , while they seemed to have conquered some ideas of the concept of a fraction as part of a unit , still maintained some beliefs from the base - theory which reﬂected upon their ordering of fractions . In Subcategory B2 : Advanced Part of a Unit , the students interpreted the fraction as the part ( piece ) of a quantity ( unit ) where the numerator indicates the parts ‘‘that we take’’ and the denominator indicates the parts in which the unit is divided . Therefore , these students believed that the frac - tion represents always a quantity smaller than a unit . In Subcategory B3 : Sophisti - cated Part of a Unit , we included the students who had developed more sophisticated processes of handling fractions . While these students considered the fractions as representing a value smaller than the whole unit , they had developed processes which helped them correctly order the fractions and the unit . For example , use of the algorithm of converting dissimilar to similar fractions in order to compare them , does not necessarily imply that they know what equivalent frac - tions are , as shown in their justiﬁcations . The students placed in the third explanatory framework Relation between Numerator / Denominator radically changed their beliefs about the concept of frac - tion , considering it is a relation between the numerator and the denominator . They believed that the order - relation of a fraction and the unit is connected immediately with the order - relation between numerator and denominator : they considered a fraction smaller than the unit when its numerator was smaller than its denomi - nator , and bigger than the unit when the numerator was bigger than the denomi - nator . The third explanatory framework was divided into Subcategory C1 : Relation of Two Numbers Without Inﬁnity , in which we grouped the students who did not refer to the unbounded inﬁnity of the fractions at all ( they believed that there is a unique smallest and biggest fraction , respectively ) and Subcategory C2 : Relation of Two Numbers With Inﬁnity , in which we grouped the students who had developed a more complete knowledge of the expressions of the fraction . These students believed that the fraction is an unbounded inﬁnite number , resulting from the quo - tient of the numerator divided by the denominator . We were able to assign 89 % of our participants in one of the above Explanatory Frameworks shown in Table 6 . In order to check the reliability of our classi - ﬁcation , another judge checked the answers of 10 participants from each age group both at the ﬁrst level of scoring and their assignment to explanatory framework .

Stafylidou , S . Vosniadou / Learning and Instruction 14 ( 2004 ) 503 – 518 514 score all the responses was high ( about 96 % ) . All disagreements were resolved after discussion . From the distribution of children in the various explanatory frameworks , we can conclude that the children progressively reorganize their initial interpretations of fraction as they approach the scientiﬁc explanatory framework . We checked our results with the Kruskal – Wallis non - parametric test . Control v 2 of independence showed that the eﬀects of grade are statistically signiﬁcant ( v 2 ð 4 Þ ¼ 21 : 13 , p < 0 : 001 ) . 4 . Discussion The results were consistent with our hypothesis that the children , in their eﬀort to approach the concept of fraction , will not adopt the scientiﬁc concept of the rational numbers immediately . As expected , they interpreted fractions in ways that revealed their eﬀorts to reconcile their initial ideas about number with the new information coming from instruction . In this process , the students formed synthetic models revealing their misconceptions . In the introduction , we argued that the development of the concept of fraction is diﬀerent from the concept of natural number in its symbolic representation . As expected , the younger students in our sample had diﬃculty understanding the relationship between the numerator and the denominator and regarded the fraction as consisting of two independent numbers . The initial explanatory framework Fraction as Two Independent Natural Numbers is consistent with the presupposition of the base - theory of number according to which ‘‘each number corresponds to a symbol’’ ( see Table 1 ) . This presupposition appears to constrain students’ represen - tation of fractions , as it is revealed from their answers concerning the smallest / biggest fraction and the ordering of fractions in which the numerators and the denominators were treated as if they were natural numbers . The students that interpret fractions in this way can use improper fractions only intuitively . The students in this explanatory framework develop two almost contradictory beliefs . One is the belief that ‘‘the value of the fraction increases as the value of the numerator ( or denominator ) increases’’ and the other is the belief that ‘‘the value of the fraction increases as the value of the numerator ( or the denominator ) decreases’’ . The ﬁrst is totally consistent with the base - theory of natural numbers . The second appears to be a synthetic model , a misconception , created as a tran - sitional phase in the process of understanding fractions . It appears that children start by understanding fraction in terms of a unit divided into parts . When the number of the parts a unit is divided into increases , each part becomes progress - ively smaller in relation to the whole . In this sense , it could be argued that ‘‘the more parts the less value’’ a fraction has . This belief is shared by students who belong to the ﬁrst and the second explanatory framework . The above analysis con - stitutes an example of how a synthetic model can develop in the case of fractions . Children’s beliefs about the relationship between the numerator and denomi - nator of a fraction also provide important information about the development of 515 S . Stafylidou , S . Vosniadou / Learning and Instruction 14 ( 2004 ) 503 – 518 the scientiﬁc concept of fraction . As we have shown , only the children grouped in the third explanatory framework Fraction as a Relation Between Two Numbers have understood that there can be fractions with the numerator equal or even big - ger than the denominator , as their initial beliefs are that the fraction 1 / 1 is smaller than the fractions 100 / 100 . The development of children’s understanding of the relationship between the numerator and the denominator is directly related to the third presupposition of the initial base - theory of natural numbers , according to which ‘‘ the unit is the smal - ler number ’’ ( Table 1 ) . The children adopting this presupposition believe that a fraction is always bigger than the unit . Moreover , by generalizing this belief , they come to the conclusion that the fraction 1 / 1 is the smallest fraction . This belief deﬁnes the initial explanatory framework we identiﬁed . In the second explanatory framework Fraction as Part of a Unit , children’s beliefs regarding the relationship between a fraction and a unit change radically . The students who adopt the second explanatory framework believe that a fraction always represents a quantity smaller than the unit ; in many cases , they use exam - ples of natural objects in order to express the unit . This idea is strengthened by the way fractions are usually taught initially . It is also consistent with the original ontology of the concept of fraction—as a part of something , the quantieme of the Ancient Egyptians ( Caveing , 1992 ) . Our results indicate that a radical change is required in students’ beliefs to form a concept of fraction as a number that can be smaller or even bigger than the unit . Only the children who adopt the explanatory frameworks B3 , C1 and C2 , have understood that a fraction can be smaller , equal , or even bigger than a unit , that is , they recognize the improper fractions . Many researchers ( e . g . Hart , 1987 ; Hiebert & Wearne , 1988 ; Nesher & Peled , 1986 ; Resnick and Ford , 1981 ; Resnick et al . , 1989 ; Resnick and Omanson , 1987 ) have examined the systematic errors and children’s misconceptions , in the case of fractions . Our analysis adds on these eﬀorts and has the additional advantage that it explains how such misconceptions can be generated from children’s attempts to relate the information they receive about fractions with their prior knowledge . It also reveals the dynamic aspect of such synthetic models , or misconceptions , as they can change in the process of learning . The present results agree with the results of previous researches that a large number of students adopt the second explanatory framework ‘‘ Fraction as Part of a Unit ’’ . The students in this explanatory framework believe that a fraction with a numerator equal to the denominator is equivalent to the unit . This belief is revealed by their answers in the ﬁrst set of questions as well as in the fraction ordering questions . Some researchers ( Behr et al . , 1992 ; Lamon , 1999 ) have focused their attention on the concept of the unit believing that it connects integers with rational numbers . They stress the need for more practice on partitioning and measurement activities , which they believe will help children develop the concept of the unit . Our results also agree with the idea that the understanding of the concept of the unit is important and suggest that possibly the concept of the unit best develops through activities that relate the unit to fractions . S . Stafylidou , S . Vosniadou / Learning and Instruction 14 ( 2004 ) 503 – 518 516 Finally , our results are consistent with those by Hartnett and Gelman ( 1998 ) , and Carey and Spelke ( 1994 ) in that children’s acceptance of the idea that decimals and fractions as numbers demands a reconsideration of the identiﬁcation of the number with counting and with the successor principal . Also required is a new understanding of division as an operation diﬀerent from continuous subtraction . The presence of diﬀerent explanatory frameworks within which the concept of the fraction can be interpreted , shows that a radical reorganization is occurring in children’s conceptual structure enabling them to adopt the scientiﬁc model .
