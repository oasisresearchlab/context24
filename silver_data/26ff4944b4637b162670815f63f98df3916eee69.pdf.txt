SUMMARY Remarkable progress in various techniques of in vivo ﬂuorescence microscopy has brought an urgent need for reliable markers for tracking cellular structures and processes . The goal of this manuscript is to describe unexplored effects of the FM ( Fei Mao ) styryl dyes , which are widely used probes that label processes of endocytosis and vesicle trafﬁcking in eukaryotic cells . Although there are few reports on the effect of styryl dyes on membrane ﬂuidity and the activity of mammalian receptors , FM dyes have been considered as reliable tools for tracking of plant endocytosis . Using plasma membrane - localized transporters for the plant hormone auxin in tobacco BY - 2 and Arabidopsis thaliana cell suspensions , we show that routinely used concentrations of FM 4 - 64 and FM 5 - 95 trigger transient re - localization of these proteins , and FM 1 - 43 affects their activity . The active process of re - localization is blocked neither by inhibitors of endocytosis nor by cytoskeletal drugs . It does not occur in A . thaliana roots and depends on the degree of hydrophobicity ( lipophilicity ) of a particular FM dye . Our results emphasize the need for circumspection during in vivo studies of membrane proteins performed using simultaneous labelling with FM dyes . Keywords : FM 4 - 64 , FM 1 - 43 , plasma membrane , tobacco BY - 2 cells , endocytosis . INTRODUCTION FM dyes are ﬂuorescent markers that were originally developed as membrane potential sensors ( Grinvald et al . , 1988 ) and later optimized to stain synaptic vesicles in vivo ( Betz and Bewick , 1992 ; Betz et al . , 1992 , 1996 ; Gafﬁeld and Betz , 2006 ) . They are widely used in tracking processes of membrane trafﬁcking in eukaryotic organisms ( Gafﬁeld and Betz , 2006 ) , including plants ( Bolte et al . , 2004 ; Aniento and Robinson , 2005 ) . The amphiphilic character of FM molecules ( Figure 1 ) allows their penetration through the cell wall fol - lowed by insertion into the plasma membrane ( PM ) and subsequent tracking of intracellular membrane dynamics . The tail region of the FM molecule is responsible for its lipophilicity . A higher number of carbons in the tail increases the lipophilicity of the molecule , but PM staining becomes irreversible ( Betz et al . , 1996 ) . The composition of the bridge region determines the ﬂuorescence wavelength of the mol - ecule . More double bonds in this region shift emission to the red part of the spectrum . In contrast to the hydrophobic environments of the PM , ﬂuorescence of FM dyes is strongly reduced in a polar solvent ( water ) . This makes FM dyes optimal for selective tracking of membrane dynamics . Moreover , positively charged head regions prevent the movement of the dye across the membrane via phospho - lipid ﬂip - ﬂopping . These chemical properties make FM dyes useful tools in tracking endocytosis and vesicle trafﬁcking in living cells . The most commonly used FM dyes in plant biology are FM 4 - 64 ( N - ( 3 - triethylammoniumpropyl ) - 4 - ( 6 - ( 4 - ( diethyla - mino ) phenyl ) hexatrienyl ) pyridinium dibromide ) and FM 1 - 43 ( N - ( 3 - triethylammoniumpropyl ) - 4 - ( 4 - ( dibutylamino ) sty - ryl ) pyridinium dibromide ) . In addition to tracking endocyto - sis ( Emans et al . , 2002 ) , these dyes are often used in tracking ª 2010 Institute of Experimental Botany , ASCR 883 Journal compilation ª 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd The Plant Journal ( 2010 ) 61 , 883 – 892 doi : 10 . 1111 / j . 1365 - 313X . 2009 . 04102 . x secretory pathways ( Dettmer et al . , 2006 ) , as after some time they end up in the vacuolar membrane , and thus can also be exploited for studies of vacuolar dynamics ( Kutsuna and Hasezawa , 2002 ) . There are also several other organelles stainedbyFMdyes ( forreviewseeBolte et al . , 2004 ) . Because of differences in the speed of incorporation into endomem - branes , FM 1 - 43 and FM 4 - 64 can be used as selective dyes for exo - and endocytosis in pollen tubes ( Zonia and Munnik , 2008 ) . Moreover , a slightly less lipophilic variant of the FM 4 - 64 molecule , red - ﬂuorescing FM 5 - 95 ( N - ( 3 - trimethy - lammoniumpropyl ) - 4 - ( 6 - ( 4 - ( diethylamino ) phenyl ) hexatrien - yl ) pyridinium dibromide ) , can be used as an alternative . The hydrophobicity of the above mentioned FM dyes gradually decreases from FM 4 - 64 through FM 5 - 95 to FM 1 - 43 ( infor - mation provided in Molecular Probes The Handbook ) . Recent progress in plant molecular biology has provided evidence for the existence of plant clathrin - dependent endo - cytosisofPINFORMED ( PIN ) auxinefﬂuxcarriers ( Dhonukshe et al . , 2007 ) . It appears that , after ﬂuid phase endocytosis ( Oparka , 1990 ) , clathrin - dependent endocytosis is the major endocytic route in plants ( Perez - Gomez and Moore , 2007 ) . Thus , FMdyesarenowconsideredaspreferentialmarkersfor this type of endocytosis , being blocked largely at the PM of the cells where the clathrin molecule is not functional ( Dhonukshe et al . , 2007 ) . The suitability of FM dyes as markersforendocyticpathwayshas recentlybeensupported by experiments involving micro - injection of FM 4 - 64 directly into the cytosol of Nicotiana tabacum BY - 2 cells and Trades - cantia virginiana stamen hair cells ( van Gisbergen et al . , 2008 ) . Moreover , a set of Fo¨rster Resonance Energy Transfer ( FRET ) data measured between FM 4 - 64 and cytoplasmic GFP ( Grifﬁng , 2008 ) also showed that thisdye is taken up into cells preferentially by endocytosis . However , even though FM dyes are undoubtedly valuable tools for several applications , few reports on their side effects have been published . Styryl - based dyes have been shown to inﬂuence membrane ﬂuidity ( Rodes et al . , 1995 ) . In addition , they block mechanotransduction channels ( Gale et al . , 2001 ) as well as the activity of muscarinic and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors ( for review , see Gafﬁeld and Betz , 2006 ) . Therefore , careful investigation of their effects on cellular structures and their activities would help in under - standing the mechanism of FM dye action and validate their exploitation as endocytotic markers . Here we show that some concentrations of FM dyes , even much lower than those widely used , have the potential to disturb the localization and activity of integral PM proteins , such as auxin carriers , in cell suspension cultures . To characterize this phenomenon , we used tobacco BY - 2 or Arabidopsis cell cultures expressing translational fusions with GFP using either the auxin efﬂux carrier PIN1 ( PIN1 : : PIN1 : GFP ; Benkova et al . , 2003 ; Petra´sˇek et al . , 2006 ) or the multi - drug resistance ( MDR ) type conditional auxin efﬂux carrier PGP4 / ABCB4 ( PGP4 : : PGP4 : GFP ; Cho et al . , 2007 ; Terasaka et al . , 2005 ; Yang and Murphy , 2009 ) from A . tha - liana . In both cases , transient internalization of GFP - tagged proteins from PM was observed upon treatment with FM 4 - 64 and FM 5 - 95 , but not with FM 1 - 43 . The internalization was not blocked by inhibitors of endocytosis or cytoskeletal drugs , but was sensitive to the metabolic drug sodium azide . Moreover , all three dyes interfered to various degrees with the activity of endogenous tobacco auxin carrier proteins and phospholipid metabolism . RESULTS FM 4 - 64 induces transient re - localization of plasma membrane proteins in BY - 2 cells We used FM styryl dyes for characterization of endosomal trafﬁcking of proteins involved in the auxin efﬂux machinery in a tobacco BY - 2 cell line . It was very easy to reproduce already published data describing the use of FM dyes ( Bolte et al . , 2004 ) . However , in addition to this , other previously uncharacterized effects of FM 4 - 64 treatment were repeat - edly observed . Direct application of 2 l M FM 4 - 64 to BY - 2 cells stably expressing either PIN1 – GFP or PGP4 – GFP resulted in transient internalization of these proteins from the PM . Control cells showed localization of PIN1 – GFP and PGP4 – GFP in the PM and the cortical cytoplasm ( Figure 2a , b , 0 min , and Figure S1a ) . After 2 min of treatment with FM 4 - 64 , a remarkable increase in the internal pool of both fusion proteins was observed as punctate GFP signal ( Figure S1 ) . This phenomenon clearly preceded the endocytosis of FM 4 - 64 , because the dye was still localized mainly on the PM 2 min after its application ( Figure S1 ) . As FM 4 - 64 internalization proceeded ( Figure 2a , b , 10 min ) , FM - labelled endosomes did not co - localize with FM - induced PIN1 – GFP patches ( Figure 2c , d ) . Similarly , no co - localization between PGP4 – GFP patches and FM - decorated endosomes was observed ( data not shown ) . Prolonged incubation with FM 4 - 64 ( up to 30 min ) resulted in remarkable endocytosis of FM 4 - 64 , but PIN1 – GFP as well as PGP4 – GFP vesicles disappeared from the cortical cytoplasm , restoring a Figure 1 . Structure of the FM dyes ( Betz et al . , 1996 ) used in this study . 884 Adriana Jelı´nkova´ et al . ª 2010 Institute of Experimental Botany , ASCR Journal compilation ª 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd , The Plant Journal , ( 2010 ) , 61 , 883 – 892 control - like situation ( i . e . localization on the PM ; Figure 2a , b , 30 min ) . Movie S1 shows PIN1 – GFP - containing vesicles 3 min after FM 4 - 64 application in comparison with the control ( Movie S2 ) . Altogether , the results show that application of FM 4 - 64 dye , at a concentration even lower than that routinely used for tracking of endocytosis , results in transient re - localiza - tion of at least two integral PM proteins in exponentially growing BY - 2 cells . FM dye - induced transient internalization of plasma membrane proteins is cell suspension culture - speciﬁc , and may be tissue - and / or species - speciﬁc To address the question of whether the above described effect of FM 4 - 64 on PM proteins is common in plant cell suspensions , we studied this effect in a cell suspension derived from A . thaliana PIN1 : : PIN1 : GFP plants ( Benkova et al . , 2003 ) . PIN1 – GFP localization in the Arabidopsis PM differs from that in BY - 2 cells ; the ﬂuorescence intensity is less homogeneous and some intracellular accumulation is seen ( Figure 3a , 0 min ) . Nevertheless , 10 min after addition of FM 4 - 64 , similar transient re - localization of PIN1 – GFP to that reported for BY - 2 cells was observed ( Figure 3a , 10 min ) . FM - labelled endosomes did not co - localize with FM - induced PIN1 – GFP patches . In comparison with BY - 2 , the recovery of PIN1 – GFP PM localization appeared to be slower ( Figure 3a , 40 min ) . The FM 4 - 64 effect was also examined in A . thaliana seedlings expressing another auxin efﬂux carrier , PIN2 – GFP ( Xu and Scheres , 2005 ) or aquaporin water channel PIP2 – GFP ( Cutler et al . , 2000 ) . PIN2 – GFP ( Figure 3b ) or PIP2 – GFP ( Figure 3c ) seedlings were treated with FM 4 - 64 . The dye was washed out and images of root epidermis and cortex at various time points up to 1 h after addition of FM dye were collected . Neither of these two proteins showed enhanced FM - induced internalization compared to mock treatment . Although a tissue and even species speciﬁcity cannot be excluded , FM dye - induced transient internalization of PM proteins appears to be cell suspension culture - speciﬁc . FM dye - induced transient internalization of plasma membrane proteins correlates with dye hydrophobicity To establish whether the above - mentioned effects of FM 4 - 64 are speciﬁc for this particular dye or whether they are ( a ) ( c ) ( d ) 250 200 150 100 50 0 0 Intensity of PIN1 : : PIN1 : GFP ( green channel ) I n t en s i t y o f F M 4 - 64 ( r ed c hanne l ) 50 Absolute frequency 100 150 200 250 0 50 100 150 200 250 ( b ) Figure 2 .

Side - effects of FM dyes in plants 885 ª 2010 Institute of Experimental Botany , ASCR Journal compilation ª 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd , The Plant Journal , ( 2010 ) , 61 , 883 – 892 more general , we compared them with similar FM dyes : the less hydrophobic FM 5 - 95 and FM 1 - 43 . To secure full satu - ration of the PM with FM dyes ( 2 l M ) , providing a compa - rable situation at the beginning of the experiment , a protocol of FM staining on ice and subsequent observation at room temperature was used ( Emans et al . , 2002 ) . This approach is often used because , at the beginning of the experiment , when the PM is saturated with FM dye on ice , endocytosis does not occur ; later on , it can be easily restored upon transfer of cells to room temperature . For all these experi - ments , a PIN1 – GFP - transformed BY - 2 cell line was used . After loading the cells with FM 4 - 64 on ice and subsequent transfer to room temperature , the PIN1 – GFP re - localization resembled that observed using a protocol without pre - incubation on ice ( Figure 4a ) . It was also transient . Although with slower kinetics , FM 5 - 95 also induced internalization of PIN1 – GFP ( Figure 4b ) and PGP4 – GFP ( data not shown ) . In contrast , the least hydrophobic dye among those tested ( FM 1 - 43 ) never induced any observable re - localization of PIN1 – GFP ( Figure 4c ) or PGP4 – GFP ( data not shown ) , even after prolonged incubation . The effect of all three FM dyes was compared as the relative decrease of the PIN1 – GFP ﬂuorescence intensity at the plasma membrane after 15 min incubation ( Figure S1e ) . These results suggest a positive correlation between the FM dye hydrophobicity and the ability to re - localize integral PM proteins . Active metabolism , but neither endocytosis nor cytoskele - ton dynamics , are necessary for FM - induced internalization of plasma membrane proteins To assess possible mechanisms triggered by the addition of FM dyes , the metabolic inhibitor sodium azide ( NaN 3 ) was used to block ATP - dependent processes in BY - 2 cells . Both FM 4 - 64 endocytosis and PIN1 – GFP internalization were totally prevented by 15 m M NaN 3 ( Figure 5a ) . This indicates an active , energy - dependent process involved in PIN1 – GFP re - localization . On the other hand , treatments that effectively block FM dye endocytosis , including prolonged incubation on ice ( Figure 5b ) as well as application of the phosphati - dylinositol 3 - kinase inhibitor wortmannin ( Figure 5c ) , were not effective in blocking the transient internalization of PIN1 – GFP caused by FM 4 - 64 . Interestingly , FM dye - induced for - mation of PIN1 – GFP patches was even more pronounced on ice , was not transient ( over short time periods ) and persisted for at least 1 h . Figure S2 shows that de - polymerization of neither actin ﬁlaments ( treated with 500 n M latrunculin B ) nor microtubules ( treated with 20 l M oryzalin ) is able to abolish the FM dye effect on PIN1 – GFP localization com - pletely . Interestingly , de - polymerization of actin ﬁlaments ( in contrast to the de - polymerization of microtubules ) slightly decreased the amount of re - localized PIN1 – GFP , suggesting partial dependence of this process on the actin cytoskeleton .

BFA compartments were formed close to the nucleus after 1 h incubation in 20 l M BFA for FM - treated as well as control cells ( data not shown ) . Treatment with BFA did not prevent the extensive formation of PIN1 – GFP - containing patches after FM 4 - 64 application ( Figure 5d ) . In cells treated with BFA but without FM 4 - 64 , no similar PIN1 – GFP patches close to the PM were observed even after 30 min ( data not shown ) . BFA compartments containing PIN proteins usually started to form after 40 min of BFA treatment , mostly in the vicinity of the nucleus . Their formation in all cells was completed after 1 h of incubation with BFA . Therefore , the BFA compartment is not yet developed in Figure 5 ( d ) . Altogether , FM 4 - 64 - induced patches are not formed from vesicles that possibly have not fused with the PM , but are rather derivatives of the PM itself . FM - induced dragging of PM proteins into cells is an active process that does not require phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase - dependent pathways . FM dyes interfere with the activity of integral plasma membrane auxin carriers To test how FM dyes interfere with the activity of integral PM auxin carriers , the radioactively labelled synthetic auxins 2 , 4 - dichlorophenoxyacetic acid ( [ 3 H ] 2 , 4 - D ) and naphthalene - 1 - acetic acid ( [ 3 H ] NAA ) were used as markers for active auxin inﬂux and efﬂux , respectively ( Petra´sˇek et al . , 2006 ) . The active auxin inﬂux decreased immediately after the addition of 2 l M FM 1 - 43 and to lesser extent after addition of 2 l M FM 4 - 64 or FM 5 - 95 , as indicated by signiﬁcantly decreased auxin accumulation in 2 - day - old wild - type BY - 2 cells ( Figure 6a ) . The active auxin efﬂux was also partly inﬂuenced by FM 1 - 43 ( i . e . the accumulation of [ 3 H ] NAA increased ) ; however , FM 4 - 64 and FM 5 - 95 had no signiﬁcant effect ( Figure 6b ) . It appears that the transient re - localization of auxin carriers caused by FM 4 - 64 and FM 5 - 95 is not sufﬁcient to change the overall balance of auxin transport across membranes , and so changes in accumula - tion of labelled auxin are hardly detectable in living cells . Nevertheless , the most hydrophilic FM dye FM 1 - 43 , which did not cause internalization of auxin carriers from the PM , had a signiﬁcant effect on the auxin accumulation in cells , suggesting another mode of direct interference with auxin carrier activity . FM dyes interfere with phospholipid metabolism To test the inﬂuence of FM dyes on the PM , we investigated the dynamics of phosphatidylcholine ( PC ) hydrolysis . PC is a major component of the PM and a substrate of phospho - lipases ; it plays a crucial role in many signal transduction processes in plants ( Meijer and Munnik , 2003 ; Wang , 2004 ) . Level of ﬂuorescently labelled diacylglycerol ( BOPIPY - DAG ) , a direct product of BODIPY - PC hydrolysis by the action of non - speciﬁc phospholipase C ( NPC ) or a non - direct product of BODIPY - PC hydrolysis by the action of phospholipase D ( PLD ) , was used as a marker of these enzyme activities . The level of BOPIPY - DAG signiﬁcantly decreased after treatment of the BY - 2 cells by virtually all tested FM dyes . In 2 l M FM 1 - 43 - treated cells , the level of BODIPY - DAG decreased to approximately 60 % within 15 min compared to non - treated cells . The effect of FM 5 - 95 was less obvious , and the decrease in BOPIPY - DAG caused by FM 4 - 64 was almost non - signiﬁcant ( Figure 6c ) . When cells were treated for 30 min , there was no further decrease in BODIPY - DAG ( data not shown ) . Thus , FM 4 - 64 does not alter the levels of DAG signiﬁ - cantly . However , as in the case of auxin carrier activity , the most hydrophilic FM dye FM 1 - 43 strongly inhibits enzyme ( s ) of phospholipid metabolism in cells . ( a ) ( b ) ( c ) Figure 4 .

Side - effects of FM dyes in plants 887 ª 2010 Institute of Experimental Botany , ASCR Journal compilation ª 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd , The Plant Journal , ( 2010 ) , 61 , 883 – 892 DISCUSSION The results presented here show a phenomenon that has not been described before , i . e . that treatment with styryl dyes of the FM family can change the localization as well as the activity of at least some integral PM proteins in plant cells . FM4 - 64 and FM5 - 95 inﬂuenced the localization of integral PM proteins . This effect was transient and related to the early phases of the interaction between FM dyes and the PM . In addition , application of FM 1 - 43 did not interfere with the trafﬁcking of PM proteins , but it signiﬁcantly decreased the activity of auxin transporters and phospholipid metabolism . These ﬁndings are important , especially given the fact that FM dyes are widely used for tracking the dynamics of the PM .

This has been veriﬁed recently by testing the FRET between FM 4 - 64 and cyto - plasmic GFP ( Grifﬁng , 2008 ) and by micro - injection of FM 4 - 64 into the cell interior ( van Gisbergen et al . , 2008 ) . In addition to clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( Dhonukshe et al . , 2007 ) and sterol endocytosis ( Kleine - Vehn et al . , 2006 ; Klima and Foissner , 2008 ) , FM 4 - 64 also appears to be a good marker for all other PM internalization processes in plants ( Bolte et al . , 2004 ) . No toxicity or similar unwanted side effects were reported after application of optimized con - centrations of FM dyes ( usually between 1 and 30 l M ; for review , see Bolte et al . , 2004 ) . In BY - 2 tobacco cells , satura - tion of the PM was achieved using 17 l M FM 4 - 64 ( Bolte et al . , 2004 ) , and this concentration did not inhibit cell division or cell - cycle progression ( Kutsuna and Hasezawa , 2002 ) . In our study , 2 l M of FM dye was enough to induce transient re - localization of PM proteins . Thus , the effective concentrations of FM dyes used in our experiments are almost 10 times lower than that reported as optimal ( Bolte et al . , 2004 ) . Interestingly , FM - induced changes in the localization of integral PM proteins were not observed in A . thaliana root epidermisand cortex cells . However , tissueand even species speciﬁcity cannot be excluded . Among other possible expla - nations , the composition of PM in various cell types and extracellular space conditions may play critical roles here . The dye must be hydrophilic enough to pass through the cell wall and hydrophobic enough to be incorporated preferen - tially into the PM . In agreement with this , Meckel et al . ( 2004 ) showed that , in the highly turgescent guard cells of Vicia faba , only the most hydrophobicdye FM 4 - 64 canbe used for trackingendocytosis , while FM 1 - 43 non - speciﬁcallylabelled various cytoplasmic structures and mitochondria . With the current knowledge of the mechanism by which FM dyes incorporate into the PM , it is not easy to explain their effect on re - localization of integral PM proteins unam - biguously . While it is not clear whether there is a preferential target for FM dyes among the spectrum of plant PM phospholipids , it is obvious that all FM dyes are positively charged and prefer speciﬁc lipids in prokaryotes . In the PM of Bacillus subtilis or Escherichia coli , FM 4 - 64 , FM 1 - 43 and FM 5 - 95 were incorporated into the same lipid spiral - like structure enriched with anionic phospholipid phosphatidyl glycerol ( Barak et al . , 2008 ) . Thus binding to speciﬁc lipids could result in lipid phase segregation , preferentially desta - bilizing proteins with speciﬁc requirements for lipid envi - ronment . As the degree of mis - localization of the PM auxin carriers correlated with the hydrophobicity of FM dyes , we can assume that FM 4 - 64 , as the most hydrophobic ( lipo - philic ) form of FM dye tested in our experiments , is incorporated into the lipid bilayer very effectively . The rapid change in the composition of the PM could trigger transient processes until a new steady state of the PM with FM dye incorporated is reached . These processes could include steric competition between FM dyes and some PM proteins , temporary changes in PM ﬂuidity , lipid phase segregation , or a combination of any of these processes . Consequently , changes in the physical properties of the phospholipid bilayer could result in the release of some material from the PM – as in the case described here , where the formation of particles that lack FM dye but contain some PM proteins was observed . At present , we are not able to conclude whether these particles are in the form of vesicles , lipid droplets or other structures . A further aspect worth mentioning is that FM dyes differ signiﬁcantly in their ability to associate with a lipid bilayer . It was shown that neuronal membranes were half - saturated with FM 4 - 64 at a concentration approximately 10 times lower than required for half saturation with FM 1 - 43 ( Zhu and Stevens , 2008 ) . Therefore , a membrane can hold 10 times more molecules of FM 1 - 43 than of FM 4 - 64 . Thus , it can be speculated that membrane ﬂuidity , which is known to be altered by styryl - based dyes ( Rodes et al . , 1995 ) , is inﬂuenced more by FM 1 - 43 than by FM 4 - 64 . It is also known that alternations of membrane ﬂuidity affect phos - pholipase activities ( Villaverde and Verstraeten , 2003 ) ; this would explain the signiﬁcant reduction of DAG levels in FM 1 - 43 - treated cells . Various treatments of BY - 2 cells were performed to examine the character of FM dye - induced PIN1 – GFP or PGP4 – GFP patches and the mechanism of their internaliza - tion . Treatment with BFA , which in plants act as an inhibitor of anterograde vesicle trafﬁcking , showed that FM 4 - 64 - induced patches were derivatives of PM and are not formed from secretory vesicles that had not been able to fuse with the PM . To check the involvement of endocytosis , low temperature and the phosphatidylinositol - 3 - kinase inhibitor wortmannin , which have all been successfully shown to block endocytosis in plants ( Emans et al . , 2002 ; Dettmer et al . , 2006 ) , were tested . As none of the treatments prevented the formation of FM - induced patches , we con - cluded that it was not this type of endocytosis , but some other process , that was stimulated by the addition of FM dyes . This was further supported by distinct localizations of FM - induced PIN1 – GFP or PGP4 – GFP patches and FM - stained vesicles , and also by the overall different timing of endocytosis labeled with FM and appearance of patches . Prolonged incubation on ice prevented formation of FM - labelled endosomes but increased and prolonged the FM - induced re - localization effect . This suggests the mechanism requiring lower amounts of energy than the clathrin - dependent one . The formation of FM - induced PIN1 or PGP4 patches was blocked only after sodium azide treatment . This suggests that the process of FM - induced PM protein re - localization is energy - dependent , possibly via an ATP - driven step . Alternatively , FM - induced internaliza - tion could also be indirectly dependent on the cell energy Side - effects of FM dyes in plants 889 ª 2010 Institute of Experimental Botany , ASCR Journal compilation ª 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd , The Plant Journal , ( 2010 ) , 61 , 883 – 892 pool , as reported in yeast for the transmembrane potential - induced re - distribution of speciﬁc transporter proteins ( Grossmann et al . , 2007 ) . A well - established auxin accumulation assay ( Delbarre et al . , 1996 ; Petra´sˇek et al . , 2006 ) was used to test the effect ( s ) of FM dyes on the function of proteins of interest , i . e . to monitor the activity of tobacco BY - 2 endogenous auxin carriers in vivo . In contrast to the formation of FM - induced patches , FM 1 - 43 was the most active in inhib - iting cellular auxin inﬂux and efﬂux , followed by FM 5 - 95 and FM 4 - 64 . The timing of the FM 1 - 43 inhibitory action on the auxin inﬂux and efﬂux activities was fully comparable to the effects of widely used speciﬁc inhibitors of active auxin inﬂux ( 1 - naphthoxyacetic acid ) and efﬂux ( 1 - naphthylphtha - lamic acid ) ( Petra´sˇek et al . , 2003 ; Hoyerova´ et al . , 2008 ) . This means that both the speciﬁc inhibitors of auxin inﬂux and efﬂux , as well as FM 1 - 43 , modify auxin accumulation immediately after their application , without any lag phase . This suggests direct action on carrier proteins residing in the PM . As FM 1 - 43 did not induce any re - localization of PM auxin carriers , its action on auxin transporters might be related to an inhibitory effect on phospholipase ( s ) reﬂected in changed levels of DAG . DAG is a PM - located second messenger directly involved in the phosphoinositide - dependent signalling system , which plays an important role in plant signalling processes . Alternatively , FM 1 - 43 could also interfere with the function of auxin carrier molecules by steric blockage , etc . Similar effects were observed with FM 1 - 43 for mechanotransduction channels of murine hair cells , neuronal cells ( Gale et al . , 2001 ; Drew and Wood , 2007 ) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors ( Mazzone et al . , 2006 ) . Interestingly , the inhibitory action of FM dyes on both active auxin inﬂux and efﬂux was inversely propor - tional to their hydrophobicity . The action of FM 4 - 64 and 5 - 95 might have been attributed to the fact that after their use there are fewer auxin carriers at the PM . However , this does not apply to FM 1 - 43 , which did not induce any internalization of these proteins . Generally , after application of these dyes to living cells , all carriers and other proteins are affected in parallel . In the case of inhibition of inﬂux , intracellular auxin accumulation is decreased , and , in con - trast , in the case of inhibition of efﬂux , auxin accumulation is increased . Thus the sum of these auxin transport processes across the PM , resulting in the net capacity for auxin accumulation in living cells , does not directly reﬂect the individual activity of auxin carriers . Only the use of auxins that are preferential ‘substrates’ for either inﬂux or efﬂux carriers gives an indication of the effect ( s ) of FM dyes on auxin transporter activity . Such treatments showed that FM dyes , particularly FM 1 - 43 , do inﬂuence the activity of auxin transport processes across the PM , and that they do so immediately after application . Altogether , even though the FM dyes are very useful tools for tracking endocytosis in vivo , they also can induce transient internalization of at least some PM proteins and alter their activity , mainly in suspension - cultured cell lines . Therefore , a very careful characterization of action of these dyes should be performed under speciﬁc experimental conditions before they are used as endocytotic markers . The data also indicate that FM dyes do not label all endocytic pathways in plants . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Plant material and gene constructs ThetobaccoBY - 2 cellline ( N . tabacum L . cv .

A gene construct containing A . thaliana PGP4 : : PGP4 : GFP in pGPTV – GFP ( Cho et al . , 2007 ) was introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV2260 and then into tobacco cells by co - cultivation as de - scribed previously ( An , 1985 ; Petra´sˇek et al . , 2003 ) . The PGP4 - transformed lines were cultivated in liquid medium supplemented with 100 mg L ) 1 kanamycin , 300 mg L ) 1 claforan and 50 mg L ) 1 hygromycin B . Plants were grown on Murashige and Skoog ( MS ) plates ( with sucrose ) under a 16 h light / 8 h dark photoperiod at 21 / 18 (cid:2) C . Experiments were performed during the light period . Uptake experiments using 2 l M FM4 - 64 were performed on 5 - day - old seedlings expressing PIN2 : : PIN2 – GFP ( Xu and Scheres , 2005 ) or 35S : : PIP2 : GFP ( Cutler et al . , 2000 ) in liquid MS medium . The A . thaliana cell suspension culture was derived from PIN1 : : PIN1 : GFP - expressing plants ( Benkova et al . , 2003 ) as described by Petra´sˇek et al . ( 2006 ) .

Phos - pholipase A 2 ( PLA 2 ) from bee venom , PC - PLC from Bacillus cereus and PLD from cabbage were obtained from Sigma - Aldrich Co . ( http : / / www . sigmaaldrich . com / ) . HPLC - grade chloroform , ethanol , methanol and high - performance thin layer chromatography ( HP - TLC ) plates were obtained from Merck ( http : / / www . merck . com ) . All other chemicals were of analytical grade . FM dyes 4 - 64 , 5 - 95 and 1 - 43 ( Molecular Probes , catalogue numbers T13320 , T23360 , T3163 ) , brefeldin A , wortmannin , latrun - culin B and oryzalin ( all Sigma - Aldrich , http : / / www . invitrogen . com ) were kept as 20 , 50 , 10 , 2 . 5 and 57 m M stock solutions , respectively , in DMSO at ) 20 (cid:2) C . Sodium azide was added from a 1 . 5 M stock solution in water to a ﬁnal concentration of 15 m M . Application of FM dyes and inhibitors FM dyes were added to 1 ml of 2 – 3 - day - old BY - 2 cell suspension under continuous shaking in multi - well plates , and samples were observed at the time indicated . Alternatively , the protocol described by Emans et al . ( 2002 ) was used . 1 ml of a 2 – 3 - day - old BY - 2 cell 890 Adriana Jelı´nkova´ et al . ª 2010 Institute of Experimental Botany , ASCR Journal compilation ª 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd , The Plant Journal , ( 2010 ) , 61 , 883 – 892 suspension was placed on ice for 15 min and then supplemented with 2 l M FM dye . After another 15 min of incubation on ice , cells were transferred to an orbital shaker at 26 (cid:2) C and observed at the time indicated . Brefeldin A , sodium azide and wortmannin were added directly to the cultivation medium to ﬁnal concentrations of 20 l M , 15 m M and 50 l M , respectively . The same amount of solvent was added to controls . Seedlings were primed for 5 min on ice with MS medium containing 2 l M FM4 - 64 , subsequently rinsed three times in liquid MS medium , and analysed by confocal microscopy . Microscopy For in vivo microscopy , a Zeiss LSM 5 DUO confocal microscope with a 40 · C - Apochromat objective ( NA = 1 . 2 W ) was used ( http : / / www . zeiss . com / ) . Fluorescence signals for GFP ( excitation 488 nm , emission 505 – 550 nm ) , FM 4 - 64 and FM 5 - 59 ( both excitation 561 nm , emission > 575 nm ) were detected . Sequential scanning was used to avoid any cross - talk between ﬂuorescence channels . To separate FM1 - 43 and GFP ﬂuorescence , spectral ﬂuorescence detection and subsequent linear unmixing were used . Lambda series ( excitation 488 and 561 nm ) were collected using the Zeiss META system . Nineteen channels ( 10 . 7 nm wide ) of the META detector were used to span an emission range of 497 – 700 nm . Lin - ear unmixing was performed using Zeiss LSM IMAGE EXAMINER soft - ware . Reference spectra of GFP and FM1 - 43 were acquired from single labelled specimens . The scattergram of ﬂuorescence inten - sities in the red and green channels was constructed using Zeiss IMAGE EXAMINER software . Independent experiments were performed in triplicate with the same results , and representative images are shown . Auxin accumulation assay Auxin accumulation by BY - 2 cells was measured according to the method described by Delbarre et al . ( 1996 ) , as modiﬁed by Petra´sˇek et al . ( 2003 ) . Accumulation by the cells of [ 3 H ] NAA ( speciﬁc radio - activity 935 GBq mmol ) 1 , synthesized at the Isotope Laboratory , Institute of Experimental Botany , Prague , Czech Republic ) or [ 3 H ] 2 , 4 - D ( speciﬁc radioactivity 20 Ci mmol ) 1 , American Radiola - beled Chemicals Inc . , http : / / www . arcincusa . com ) was measured in 0 . 5 ml aliquots of cell suspension ( cell density approximately 7 · 10 5 cells ml ) 1 , as determined by counting cells in a Fuchs – Ro - senthal haemocytometer ) . FM dyes were added at the beginning of the accumulation assay . The values for the net accumulation of auxin ( with the value at time 0 subtracted ) after 20 min of incuba - tion with radioactive auxin and FM dye were plotted relative to the control accumulation without FM dyes . Determination of non - speciﬁc phospholipase C activity Fluorescent substrate ( 0 . 66 l g ml ) 1 BODIPY - PC ) was added to a 3 - day - old BY - 2 cell suspension . The suspension was diluted to 0 . 056 g FW ml ) 1 . After 10 min of incubation , FM dye was added to the ﬁnal concentration of 10 l M . After incubation on an orbital shaker at 26 (cid:2) C in darkness for 15 min , the cells were harvested for the extraction of lipids and HP - TLC analysis of reaction products . Lipids were extracted by a modiﬁcation of the method described by Bligh and Dyer ( 1959 ) . Brieﬂy , 4 ml of methanol / chloroform ( 2 / 1 v / v ) was added to harvested cells . After 30 min of extraction , 2 ml 0 . 1 M KCl was added , and the mixture was left at 4 (cid:2) C for at least 30 min . Then samples were centrifuged for 15 min at 420 g . The lower phase was evaporated to dryness using a vacuum evaporator and re - dissolved in ethanol . Samples were applied to HP - TLC silica gel - 60 plates using a Linomat IV sampler ( Camag , http : / / www . camag . com ) . After 10 min of saturation , plates were developed in a horizontal developing chamber ( Camag ) in a mobile phase of chloroform / methanol / water ( 65 / 25 / 4 v / v / v ) ( Scherer et al . , 2002 ) . Plates weredried and scanned using avideo camera ( Kodak DC 120 , http : / / www . kodak . com ) under UV light for computer - assisted quantiﬁcation ( Kodak ds 1D ) . Identiﬁcation of individual spots was based on comparison with ﬂuorescently labelled lipid standards .
