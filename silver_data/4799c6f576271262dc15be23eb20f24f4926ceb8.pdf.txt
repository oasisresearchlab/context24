Ferguson 1 The threat posed by the highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus requires public health authorities to prepare for a human pan - demic . Although pre - pandemic vaccines and antiviral drugs might significantly reduce illness rates 1 , 2 , their stockpiling is too expen - sive to be practical for many countries . Consequently , alternative control strategies , based on non - pharmaceutical interventions , are a potentially attractive policy option . School closure is the measure most often considered . The high social and economic costs of closing schools for months make it an expensive and therefore controversial policy , and the current absence of quan - titative data on the role of schools during influenza epidemics means there is little consensus on the probable effectiveness of school closure in reducing the impact of a pandemic . Here , from the joint analysis of surveillance data and holiday timing in France , we quantify the role of schools in influenza epidemics and predict the effect of school closure during a pandemic . We show that holidays lead to a 20 – 29 % reduction in the rate at which influenza is transmitted to children , but that they have no detect - able effect on the contact patterns of adults . Holidays prevent 16 – 18 % of seasonal influenza cases ( 18 – 21 % in children ) . By extra - polation , we find that prolonged school closure during a pandemic might reduce the cumulative number of cases by 13 – 17 % ( 18 – 23 % in children ) and peak attack rates by up to 39 – 45 % ( 47 – 52 % in children ) . The impact of school closure would be reduced if it proved difficult to maintain low contact rates among children for a prolonged period . A thorough evaluation of the effectiveness of school closure as a pandemic mitigation measure is difficult , owing to the limited epi - demiological data 3 and the current deficit in statistical methods to analyse those data . So far , it has been possible to establish that school closure is negatively correlated with influenza incidence 4 , 5 . Mathe - matical models have been used to evaluate the impact of school closure in a pandemic 1 , 2 , 6 . However , in the absence of quantitative estimates derived from epidemiological data , those models made strong assumptions about school transmission . The relatively wide range of effects they predicted 1 , 2 , 6 shows that modelling assumptions cannot replace the statistical investigation of epidemiological data . Here we present a novel statistical approach to evaluating the impact of school closure on influenza epidemics from the joint ana - lysis of disease surveillance data and information on the timing of school holidays in France . The hypothesis we examine is that influ - enza transmission changes during holidays as a result of the altered mixing patterns of children . The Sentinel network 7 , 8 ( see http : / / www . sentiweb . org and Supplementary Information ) is an internet - based network of French general practitioners ( GPs ) . Since 1984 , approximately 1 , 200 GPs have collected and sent data regularly on a dozen diseases , including influenza - like illness ( case definition : sudden temperature of . 39 u C , myalgia and cough / running nose ) . Regional daily incidences of influenza - like illness are estimated as area - weighted averages from individual GP declarations , using population data and data on the percentage of GPs participating in the surveillance network . Data on the timing of French holidays in different regions was obtained from the French Ministry of Education . In France , holidays are staggered across three geographic zones ( two zones in 1986 and 1990 ) and the timing varies from region to region and from year to year . This provides conditions resembling those of a natural experiment . The surveillance data consist of daily incidences for children ( , 18years old ) and adults ( $ 18 years old ) for the two or three holiday zones in mainland France and over 21 years ( 1985 – 2006 ) . We assume that half of all influenza patients consult his or her GP , giving a reasonable average attack rate of 11 . 4 % ( range 4 . 6 – 20 . 6 % ) . We select epidemic periods ( weekly incidence . 160 per 100 , 000 inhabitants ) and discard one epidemic that lasted 13 days only . This leaves 60epidemic periods , with average duration 61days ( range 22 – 111 days ) ( Fig . 1a ) . We model the spread of influenza in a population structured into households and schools ( Fig . 1d ; see Methods and Supplementary Information ) . Community transmission also occurs randomly between all members of the population . The simulated population matches the structure of the French population ( Fig . 1b , c ) . We assume that at the start of each influenza season an average of 27 % of the population is immune 9 , and that immunity is distributed within the population from its expected stationary distribution ( see Supplementary Information ) . During holidays , no transmission occurs in schools , but in other places ( household , community ) , transmission rates may be modified . We use estimates from another study 10 to characterize household transmission and the infectious - ness profile ( generation time 2 . 4 days ) . The high dimensionality of the data means that model parameters cannot be estimated using standard statistical methods , such as least - squares fitting or data augmentation 10 . We therefore designed a new statistical approach , based on the simulation of epidemics that are constrained to be consistent with the observed incidence curves ( Fig . 1e ; see Methods and Supplementary Information ) . Using simu - lated data , we find that , even in a context with observation errors and where transmissibility varies substantially between epidemics , the inference method gives satisfactory estimates of all parameters ( see Supplementary Information ) . The approach also provides the rela - tive prediction error ( RPE ; see Fig . 2a ) . We first estimate transmission parameters under the assumption that influenza transmission is not modified during holidays ( see Supplementary Information ) . For this model , adult and child RPEs are close to 0 % during the school term ( Fig . 2a ) . Adult RPE is also close to 0 % during holidays ; but child RPE drops to 2 24 % ( range 2 20 % to 2 29 % ) during holidays . This implies that , on average , 1 MRCCentreforOutbreakAnalysisandModelling , DepartmentofInfectiousDiseasesEpidemiology , ImperialCollegeLondon , NorfolkPlace , LondonW21PG , UK . 2 Universite´Pierreet MarieCurie—Paris6 , UMRS707 , 27rueChaligny , Paris75012 , France . 3 INSERM , UMRS707 , 27rueChaligny , Paris75012 , France . 4 AP - HP , HoˆpitalStAntoine , 27rueChaligny , Paris 75012 , France . 5 French School of Public Health ( EHESP ) , 1 place du Parvis Notre - Dame , Paris F - 75004 , France .

We then estimate transmission parameters allowing for modifica - tions of children’s contact patterns during holidays . Three quantities are needed : transmission rates within schools , in the community , and the increase in non - school transmission rates during holidays ( com - pensatory behaviours ) . It is not possible to estimate those three quan - tities independently from the available data . We therefore fix one of them ( compensatorybehaviours ) andestimatetheothertwo . Wethen undertakearigoroussensitivityanalysisoncompensatorybehaviours , considering30parametercombinationsparameterizedbytheincreaseinchild - to - child community transmission ( d com 5 0 % , 50 % , 100 % , 150 % , 200 % and up to ‘ ) and in child - to - child household transmis - sion ( d hous 5 0 % , 50 % , 100 % , 150 % and 200 % ) . Irrespective of { d com , d hous } , we find that accounting for holidays improves the model fit : ( 1 ) log - likelihoods are larger ( see Supple - mentary Information ) ; ( 2 ) child RPE becomes close to 0 % during holidays ( Fig . 2a ) . We find that the proportion of transmission occurring in schools increases with { d com , d hous } , ranging from 7 to 20 % overall ( Fig . 2c ) and from 20 to 54 % in children ( Fig . 2d ) . The proportion of secondary cases of children infected in schools is 16 – 44 % . Other summary statistics are robust to a change in { d com , d hous } ( see Supplementary Information ) . Although children repre - sent 28 % of the population , they are responsible for 46 – 47 % of all infections ( Fig . 2e ) . Household transmission accounts for 36 – 39 % of infections of children ( and 40 % of adult infections ) . Household members make up 48 – 50 % of secondary cases in children . The basic reproduction number , R 0 ( average number of cases generated by one typical case in a completely susceptible population ) is estimated to be 1 . 7 ( range 1 . 5 – 1 . 8 ) during school term , and 1 . 4 ( range 1 . 3 – 1 . 6 ) in holidays . The average R 0 for child cases is 2 . 2 ( range 2 . 0 - 2 . 4 ) during term and 1 . 7 ( 1 . 4 – 1 . 9 ) during holidays , while for adult cases it is 1 . 3 ( range 1 . 2 - 1 . 4 ) for both terms and holidays ( see Supplementary Information ) . No major difference in transmission is detected between Christmas and other breaks ( winter and spring breaks ) . For adults , RPE is 0 % ( range 2 4 % to 5 % ) over Christmas and 1 % ( range 2 4 % to 5 % ) during other breaks . For children , RPE is 2 4 % ( range 2 15 % to 9 % ) over Christmas and 2 1 % ( range 2 12 % to 12 % ) during other breaks .

We then simulate epidemics from the model , with parameters drawn from their posterior distribution for the different model variants ( Fig . 1a and Supplementary Information ) . Simulations start at the same time and with the same number of initial cases as observed epidemics , use season - specific transmissibility estimates , but are not otherwise constrained . For adults , 81 % ( 83 % for chil - dren ) of observed daily attack rates fall between the 2 . 5th and 97 . 5th percentile of the distribution of simulated daily attack rates . These simulations are used to assess the impact of school closure on seasonal and pandemic attack rates . Figure 3a – c shows that , irre - spective of the assumptions made about { d com , d hous } , we obtain the same estimates of the impact of school closure on cumulative and peak attack rates . For typical holiday timings , the different model variants predict an average seasonal attack rate of 10 . 6 – 11 . 1 % . They also predict that , if schools were always open , the attack rate would be 12 . 8 – 13 . 4 % ; that is , holidays prevent 16 – 18 % of seasonal influenza cases ( for adults 14 – 17 % ; for children 18 – 21 % ) . We then consider the pandemic context , where 100 % of the popu - lation is susceptible and assume that 50 % of infections are symp - tomatic . For typical holiday timings , 31 % of the population would report being ill ( 37 – 38 % of children ) ; and the daily incidence at the peak would be 1 . 6 – 1 . 7 % ( 2 . 1 – 2 . 2 % in children ) . If schools were closed permanently at an early stage ( for example , once daily inci - dence exceeds 20 / 100 , 000 ) , with subsequent behaviour typical of holidays , the cumulative number of cases would be curbed by 13 – 17 % overall ( for children only 18 – 23 % ) and the number of cases at the peak by 39 – 45 % ( for children only 47 – 52 % ) . Contact patterns might , however , be less affected by prolonged school closure than by normal school breaks , when people go on vacation , celebrate Christmas , and so on . The reductions we predict might therefore be an upper bound of what might happen during school closure in a pandemic . If compensatory increases in contact rates { d com , d hous } were 1 . 5 - fold larger during school closure in a pandemic than for typical holidays , there would be at most a very limited reduction in cumulative / peak attack rates and in R 0 ( Fig . 3d – i and Supplementary Information ) . 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 ∞ ∞ ∞ 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 0 0 . 05 0 . 1 0 . 15 0 . 2 0 . 25 a c b Adult Child Adult Specific transmission model for holidays No change assumed during holidays d Child d hous d com d hous d com d hous d com 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 e 0 . 90 0 . 95 1 . 00 1 . 05 0 . 9 1 . 0 1 . 1 1 . 2 Strength of transmission A \ H3N2 A \ H1N1 BA \ H3N2−A \ H1N1 A \ H3N2−B S c h oo l H o li d a y S c h oo l H o li d a y S c h oo l H o li d a y S c h oo l H o li d a y −0 . 3 −0 . 2 −0 . 1 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 −0 . 3 −0 . 2 −0 . 1 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 R e l a t i v e c o n t r i b u t i o n o f c h il d r e n t o t r a n s m i ss i o n R P E R P E P e r ce n t a g e o f t r a n m i ss i o n i n s c h o o l P e r ce n t a g e o f c h il d r e n i n f ec t e d i n s c h o o l P e r c e n t a g e i n f ec t e d b y c h il d r e n Figure 2 | Inferred influenza transmission characteristics . a , Posterior distribution ( 2 . 5 % , 25 % , 50 % , 75 % and 97 . 5 % percentiles ) of the RPE for adults and children , during school terms and during holidays , when no change in transmission is assumedduring holidays ( left ) and whena specific transmission model is designed for holidays ( right ) .

LETTERS NATURE | Vol 452 | 10 April 2008 752 Nature PublishingGroup ©2008 For one model variant ( d com 5 d hous 5 100 % ) , we then perform a sensitivity analysis and find that results are relatively robust to varying other model assumptions ( Fig . 3d – i and Supplementary Information ) . If prolonged school closure has the same impact as holidays , the relative reduction in the cumulative number of cases in a pandemic is always below 20 % , except under the unlikely ( see Supplementary Information ) assumptions that immunity is comple - tely clustered in households ( 42 % reduction ) or that the generation time is as long as 4 . 1 days ( 25 % reduction ) . Summary statistics on the place of transmission are also relatively robust to changes in modelling assumptions ( see Supplementary Information ) . The derivation of influenza incidence from GP reports is uncertain because some cases do not visit a GP , only a small proportion of GPs report , diagnosis is based on influenza - like illness with no viral ascer - tainment and there are asymptomatic infections . Three observations do however suggest that the influenza - like illness data provide a sensible description of influenza circulation . First , they are consistent with data collected independently on virus circulation ( see Supple - mentary Information ) . Second , weekly mortality due to pneumonia and influenza is almost perfectly predicted by the surveillance data and the circulating strains 11 . Lastly , solely on the basis of the influ - enza - like illness data , we found that transmission characteristics of influenza depended on the circulating subtype ( Fig . 2b ) , in a way that is consistent with past epidemiological studies 12 – 14 . Although the apparent impact of public health measures was sub - stantial ( thatis , upto50 % reduction intransmission ) insomeUScities in 1918 , it is not possible to disentangle the relative impact of different measures 15 – 17 . School closure was commonly adopted , and in some of the cities in which schools were closed , the total impact of all public health measures was estimated to be as low as 10 % ( ref . 15 ) . Here , we used a natural experiment to estimate the specific effect of school closure on seasonal influenza transmission . Our extrapolations to the pandemic context rest on the relatively strong assumption that people will behave during a pandemic as they do during seasonal outbreaks . a b c d i g h f 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 0 1 2 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 0 1 2 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 0 1 2 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 5 10 15 0 10 20 30 40 0 10 20 30 40 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1 2 3 4 5 e 0 A D C B F E H I J K L M N G A D C B F E H I J K L M N G A D C B F E H I J K L M N G A D C B F E H I J K L M N G A D C B F E H I J K L M N G A D C B F E H I J K L M N G d hous d com d hous d com d hous d com C h il d s ea s o n a l c u m u l a t i v e a tt ac k r a t e ( % ) C h il d p a n d e m i c c u m u l a t i v e a tt ac k r a t e ( % ) O v e r a ll p a n d e m i c c u m u l a t i v e a tt ac k r a t e ( % ) C h il d p a n d e m i c p ea k a tt ac k r a t e ( % ) O v e r a ll p a n d e m i c p ea k a tt ac k r a t e ( % ) O v e r a ll s ea s o n a l c u m u l a t i v e a tt ac k r a t e ( % ) ∞ ∞ ∞ Figure 3 | Impact of school closure on seasonal and pandemic influenza . a , Relative reduction in seasonal influenza cumulative attack rates due to holidays , according to the assumed compensatory increase in contact rates in the community ( d com ) and in the household ( d hous ) during French holidays , and under baseline assumptions ( see main text ) . b , Relative reduction in pandemic cumulative attack rates due to permanent school closure , assuming closure has the same effect on transmission as holidays . c , As for b , but for peak daily attack rate . d – i , Sensitivity analyses for parameters estimated assuming d com 5 d hous 5 100 % during French holidays .

NATURE | Vol 452 | 10 April 2008 LETTERS 753 Nature PublishingGroup ©2008 Because demography and school holiday patterns are similar across much of Europe , we are confident that our results can be extrapolated to other European countries . Extrapolation to deve - loping countries is more difficult because of the absence of indepen - dent data . Compared with other studies of influenza transmission 18 , 19 , our analysis shows that age is an important determinant of seasonal variations in influenza transmission both within ( holidays fun - damentally affect children’s contact patterns ) and between epidemics ( there are large variations between seasons in the relative contri - bution of children to transmission ) . Methods used to estimate parameters of complex transmission models ( forexample , dataaugmentationtechniques 10 ) havetradition - ally been very distinct from techniques used for prediction ( that is , simulation 1 ) . The difficulty ( and sometimes , as here , impossibility ) of implementing those estimation methods for high - dimensional dynamicalmodelslargelyexplains why estimation often rests on naive least - squares fitting . In contrast , the new statistical method presented here , which relies on sequential Monte Carlo methods 20 , 21 , makes it straightforward to upgrade a complex epidemic simulator to a com - putationally efficient likelihood - based inference tool . Pandemic planning is a challenging task in today’s highly con - nected world and when some key characteristics of the future pan - demic virus cannot be predicted . Mathematical models provide a framework for assisting rational decision - making . However , for models to have predictive power , it is critical that they make full use of epidemiological data . Undertaking more epidemiological studies and designing statistical methods to extract maximum information from the data collected therefore remains a priority . In public health terms , our conclusions do not rule out the use of school closure in a severe pandemic . We predict that this policy can significantly reduce the stress on healthcare systems at the peak of the pandemic . But our work should temper expectations of the scale of the reduction in overall illness and mortality achievable through this measure alone . METHODS SUMMARY Transmission model .

Let h be the baseline transmission parameters and V the set of parameters characterizing annual variations in transmission . Consider an outbreak occurring in year y . Given the initial state ofthesystem , itisstraightforwardtosimulateepidemicsfromthemodel ( weuse a discrete time - step of D T 5 0 . 25days ) . The epidemic starts at time - step L 5 0 . Denote by Z L the history of the epidemic ( specifying those in the population who are infected and those who are immune , and the times of infection ) up to time - step L . Given Z L 2 1 , the probability that susceptible person i is infected during time - step L is : p Li , y ~ 1 { exp { l i , y L D T ð Þ D T (cid:4) (cid:5) where l i , y ( t ) is the hazard of infection . The associated density is : P Z L j Z L { 1 , h , V ð Þ ~ P i : susceptiblepeople at L { 1 p Li , y (cid:6) (cid:7) x Li 1 { p Li , y (cid:6) (cid:7) 1 { x Li where x Li is equal to 1 if susceptible person i is infected at time - step L and zero otherwise . The unconstrained density for the complete history of the epidemic Z is : g Z j h , V ð Þ ~ P Z 0 j Y , h ð Þ P ? L ~ 1 P Z L j Z L { 1 , h , V ð Þ ð 1 Þ Seeding the initial state of the system { Z 0 } is described in the Supplementary Information . Simulation of constrained epidemics . We modify the unconstrained simulator to a constrained simulator , which simulates epidemics consistent with the data . Assumethattheconstrainedepidemichasbeensimulateduptotime - step L 2 1 . From the model , we compute the risk of infection l i , y ( L D T ) for each susceptible person i for time - step L ; and derive the expected incidence for adults E A ( L ) and children E C ( L ) : E A L ð Þ ~ P i : a ( i ) ~ A l i , y L D T ð Þ D T N com and E C L ð Þ ~ P i : a ( i ) ~ C l i , y L D T ð Þ D T N com Wedenoteby Y A ( L ) and Y C ( L ) theobservedincidenceattimestep L amongadults andchildrenrespectively . Theratioofobservedincidencetoexpectedincidenceis r A ( L ) 5 Y A ( L ) / E A ( L ) for adults and r C ( L ) 5 Y C ( L ) / E C ( L ) for children . The con - strained epidemic is obtained by simulating the infection process with corrected infection risks . For any susceptible person i , the corrected infection risk is : l (cid:1) i , y L D T ð Þ ~ r a i ð Þ L ð Þ l i , y L D T ð Þ where a ( i ) is the age ( either adult or child status ) of the susceptible person . It is straightforwardtocheck that , for theconstrainedprocess , the expectedincidence at time step L is Y A ( L ) for adults and Y C ( L ) for children . The density of the constrained simulation for time - step L is : P constrained Z L j Z L { 1 , Y , h , V ð Þ ~ P i : susceptiblepeople at L { 1 p L (cid:1) i , y (cid:6) (cid:7) x Li 1 { p L (cid:1) i , y (cid:6) (cid:7) 1 { x Li where p L (cid:1) i , y ~ 1 { exp { l (cid:1) i , y L D T ð Þ D T n o is the constrained probability of infec - tion . The constrained density for the complete history of the epidemic Z is : h Z j Y , h , V ð Þ ~ P Z 0 j Y , h ð Þ P ? L ~ 1 P constrained Z L j Z L { 1 , Y , h , V ð Þ ð 2 Þ Approximation of the likelihood . If the complete history of the epidemic Z ( who has been infected when in the structured population ) was known , it would be easy to write down the probability P ( Z j h , V ) ( see Supplementary Information ) , and then likelihood - based inference , in a frequentist or bayesian setting , would be straightforward . However , the data Y consist only of daily incidences . The likelihood P ( Y j h , V ) is then difficult to compute because it requires integration with respect to the ( unobserved ) complete history Z , which has a very high dimension : P Y j h , V ð Þ ~ ð Z P Y j Z ð Þ g Z j h , V ð Þ d Z The first term of the integrand is the observation model , which ensures that complete history Z is consistent with the observedcurves Y : so P ( Y j Z ) is equal to 1 if Z is consistent with Y and 0 otherwise . The second term is the sampling density for the complete history Z of the epidemic ( equation ( 1 ) ) . We have designed an approach based on sequential importance sampling 20 , 21 toapproximatethelikelihood . Theideaistoworkwithsimulatedepidemicsthat are constrained to be consistent with the observation Y ( see above ) , and have density h ( equation ( 2 ) ) . We can rewrite the likelihood ( via multiplication by 1 ) as : P Y j h , V ð Þ ~ ð Z g Z j h , V ð Þ h Z j Y , h simul , V simul ð Þ h Z j Y , h simul , V simul ð Þ d Z To obtain an importance sampling approximation 21 of this integral , we simulate Z 1 , … , Z N constrained epidemics ( sampling from density h , with parameters { h simul , V simul } ) , and approximate the likelihood by : P Y j h , V ð Þ < 1 N X N n ~ 1 g Z j h , V ð Þ h Z j Y , h simul , V simul ð Þ Thereismuchlessstochasticfluctuationinthesamplingprocessthanforuncon - strainedepidemics , sowedonothavetosimulatelargenumbersofepidemicsper observed curve . We found that the integral was well evaluated using only one simulation per observed curve ( N 5 1 ; see Supplementary Information ) . So , in practice , we used N 5 1 . This point makes the whole estimation process extre - mely efficient . Anothertypicalfeatureofsequentialimportancesamplingisthattheepidemic trajectory supporting estimation of the log - likelihood does not have to be obtained with the parameters of interest , that is { h simul , V simul } may be different from { h , V } . Therefore , using a trajectory simulated with well - chosen values of { h simul , V simul } , the approximation of the log - likelihood is possible in a larger regionoftheparameterspace . Thispropertyisattheheartofourestimatesofthe annual variations in transmission V ( see Supplementary Information ) . Statistical framework . In a bayesian context , we explore the posterior distri - bution of the parameters by Markov - chain Monte Carlo sampling 22 . When we account for annual variations in influenza transmission V , we rely on the profile likelihood for h : LP h , Y ð Þ ~ P Y h , ^ VV h ð Þ (cid:8)(cid:8) (cid:2) (cid:3) where ^ VV h ð Þ maximizes P ( Y j h , V ) with respect to V and satisfies identifiability constraints ( see Supplementary Information ) . doi : 10 . 1038 / nature06732 Nature PublishingGroup ©2008
