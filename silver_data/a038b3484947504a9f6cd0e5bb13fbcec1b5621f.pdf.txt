In this regime , the ensemble - averaged mean - squared displacement of the particles is proportional to (cid:1) (cid:2) , where 0 < (cid:2) < 1 from 0 : 1 < (cid:1) < 100 s and depends only on the ratio of the probe radius to mesh size . By directly imaging hundreds of particles over 20 min , we determine this anomalous subdiffusion is due to the dynamics of infrequent and large jumps particles make between distinct pores in the network .

Ya The cytoskeleton is composed of dense actin ﬁlament ( F - actin ) networks that regulate many important cellular processes such as cell shape , motility , and division [ 1 ] . The mechanical properties of these networks control proper biological function , but these mechanical proper - ties are challenging to measure in vivo and are difﬁcult to model theoretically as the details of cytoskeletal micro - structure are not well understood [ 2 , 3 ] . This has moti - vated an extensive effort to measure the mechanical properties and microstructure of reconstituted F - actin networks in vitro [ 4 – 9 ] . F - actin is a semiﬂexible polymer , which is characterized by a persistence length of 10 – 20 (cid:5) m , roughly 3 orders of magnitude larger than the ﬁlament diameter of 7 nm [ 10 , 11 ] . In vitro , the con - tour length of F - actin ﬁlaments is typically greater than 20 (cid:5) m , and semidilute solutions of actin form entangled networks of semiﬂexible polymers with an average mesh size , (cid:6) , of order 100 nm to 1 (cid:5) m . Thus , solutions of en - tangled F - actin are an ideal model system with which to study the unique dynamics and mechanical properties of semiﬂexible polymer networks and to investigate the implications of the underlying mechanisms of these prop - erties for the behavior of the cytoskeleton . The unique mechanical properties of F - actin networks are determined by structures and dynamics on the scale of microns . Thus , full elucidation of these properties demands techniques that probe the behavior at these length scales ; this has inspired the development of micro - rheological methods , where the motion of micron - sized tracer particles , driven by thermal , magnetic , or optical forces , is used to make precise local measurements of viscosity and mechanical properties at the length scale of the tracer particle [ 4 – 9 , 12 – 14 ] . When the particle radius , a , is much smaller than (cid:6) , the one - dimensional mean - squared displacement ( MSD ) , h (cid:6) x 2 (cid:2) (cid:1) (cid:3)i , of the tracer , particles evolves linearly in time , h (cid:6) x 2 (cid:2) (cid:1) (cid:3)i (cid:5) 2 D(cid:1) . In this case , the particle motion is sensitive to the local viscosity of the solvent and reﬂects the effect of macro - molecular crowding [ 15 , 16 ] as well as hydrodynamic interactions with the network [ 5 , 17 ] , both of which de - crease the measured diffusion constant , D . By contrast , when a is larger than (cid:6) , the particles are constrained by the surrounding polymer network , and the bead motions directly reﬂect the local elasticity of the network [ 6 , 8 , 14 ] . In the intermediate case , when a (cid:6) (cid:6) , the particle motion should directly probe the network dynamics and mechan - ics at the scale of a , the critical length scale for important network properties ; unfortunately , very little is known about particle motion when a (cid:6) (cid:6) . In this Letter , we show that particle motion in F - actin networks with a (cid:6) (cid:6) does indeed directly reﬂect the dynamics of the local microstructure of the network . The ensemble - averaged MSD of particles exhibits anomalous subdiffusive behavior , h (cid:6) x 2 (cid:2) (cid:1) (cid:3)i (cid:7) (cid:1) (cid:2) , where 0 < (cid:2) < 1 , over a wide range of lag times , (cid:1) . Remarkably , the diffusive exponent , (cid:2) , is a function only of the ratio of the particle radius to the mesh size and can be tuned from one to zero over a narrow range 0 : 42 < a = (cid:6) < 1 : 25 . This subdiffusive behavior is due to the surprising dynamics of individual particles ; they remain trapped within a local - ized ‘‘cage’’ of actin ﬁlaments , but can infrequently ‘‘jump’’ between different cages . The temporal distribu - tion of these jumps results in the anomalous subdiffusion and reveals new insights into the length scale dependent dynamics of the entangled F - actin microstructure . Lyophilized G - actin is dissolved in deionized water , dialyzed against fresh G - buffer ( 2 mM Tris - HCl , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM DTT , 0 . 005 % NaN 3 , p H 8 . 0 ) at 4 (cid:8) C for 24 h and used within 7 days of preparation . G - actin is mixed with carboxylate modiﬁed colloidal spheres with radius a (cid:5) 0 : 25 (cid:5) m and polymerized by gently mixing with 1 = 10 of the ﬁnal sample volume of 10 x F - buffer ( 20 mM Tris - HCl , 20 mM MgCl 2 , 1 M KCl , 2 mM DTT , 2 mM CaCl 2 , 5 mM ATP , p H 7 . 5 ) . The mesh size in microns is (cid:6) (cid:5) 0 : 3 = (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1) c A p [ 4 ] , where the actin con - centration c A is measured in mg = mL . Modifying the bead surface chemistry to prevent total protein adsorption has small effects on the overall particle mobility [ 8 ] , but P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S week ending 30 APRIL 2004 V OLUME 92 , N UMBER 17 178101 - 1 0031 - 9007 = 04 = 92 ( 17 ) = 178101 ( 4 ) $ 22 . 50  2004 The American Physical Society 178101 - 1 does not qualitatively affect our results . The sample is loaded into a glass sample chamber , sealed with vacuum grease , and equilibrated under constant rotation for 1 h at (cid:7) 25 (cid:8) C . We image approximately 100 particles using bright ﬁeld microscopy and follow their dynamics with a charge - coupled device camera ( 30 images = s , 1 = 2000 s shutter ) for 4 – 30 min [ 18 ] . We focus 100 (cid:5) m into the sample to avoid wall effects . Particle centers are found in each image to an accuracy of 20 nm , and particle trajec - tories are determined [ 19 ] to calculate the ensemble - averaged MSD h (cid:6) x 2 (cid:2) (cid:1) (cid:3)i . We observe dramatically different temporal depen - dence of the MSD as a = (cid:6) is varied . When a > (cid:6) , the particle is tightly conﬁned by the local elasticity of the network , and its thermal motion can then be interpreted using the framework of microrheology [ 6 , 12 ] to provide a direct measure of the plateau shear modulus , although the full frequency dependence of the modulus is not captured by the thermal motion of a single particle [ 14 ] . For example , in an F - actin network with (cid:6) (cid:5) 0 : 17 , the MSD of 0 : 25 (cid:5) m particles is approximately constant between 0 . 01 and 10 s , as shown by the open squares in Fig . 1 ; this corresponds to an elastic modulus of 2 Pa , which is consistent with the elastic plateau modulus mea - sured with bulk rheology [ 20 ] . By contrast , if a (cid:10) (cid:6) , the particle can diffuse freely , and the diffusion coefﬁcient D can be used to probe the viscosity of the background ﬂuid of the network . For F - actin with (cid:6) (cid:5) 0 : 75 , the MSD of 0 : 25 (cid:5) m spheres evolves nearly linearly in time between 0 . 01 and 10 s , as shown by the open triangles in Fig . 1 . This corresponds to a solvent viscosity of 1 . 5 cP , slightly larger than the viscosity of pure water , presumably re - ﬂecting the effects of hydrodynamic interactions with the actin network [ 5 ] . However , when a is comparable to (cid:6) , dramatically different behavior is observed . The MSD exhibits anomalous subdiffusion , increasing as a power law for large times , h (cid:6) x 2 (cid:2) (cid:1) (cid:3)i (cid:7) (cid:1) (cid:2) , where the exponent (cid:2) depends on the ratio of the particle radius a to the mesh size (cid:6) , as shown by the solid symbols in Fig . 1 . The motion of earlier lag times is also subdiffusive , albeit with a slightly larger exponent . Interpreting this anoma - lous diffusion using microrheological analysis yields a viscoelastic response , whose magnitude and frequency dependence are in sharp disagreement with bulk mea - surements . Thus , the MSD does not provide an accurate or robust measure of the viscoelasticity and must reﬂect alternate microscopic particle dynamics . To elucidate the origin of these subdiffusive MSDs , we exploit the advantages of multiple particle tracking [ 18 ] and examine the spatial trajectories of individual tracers in 0 : 9 mg = mL F - actin , where a = (cid:6) (cid:5) 0 : 83 for times up to 30 min . The majority of the particles are highly con - strained by the network , and their trajectories exhibit ﬂuctuations with nearly Gaussian statistics , as illustrated by the spatial and temporal trajectories shown in Figs . 2 ( a ) and 2 ( b ) , respectively . If the ensemble average is restricted to these constrained particles , the MSD approaches a plateau at times longer than 0 . 4 s , as shown by the solid curve in Fig . 3 ( a ) ; using the microrheology formalism yields an elastic plateau modulus of 0 . 15 Pa , consistent with bulk measurements [ 20 ] . However , roughly 20 % of the particles exhibit remarkably different dynamics . These particles undergo constrained motion punctuated by large scale jumps , as illustrated by the spatial and temporal trajectories in Figs . 2 ( c ) and 2 ( d ) . The time scale of these jumps is very short compared to the residence time within the cages . This suggests that the particles randomly and rapidly jump between different microenvironments wherein they are constrained . Within these local environments , the MSD exhibits the same time dependence as that of the majority of the particles which do not display these jumps , as shown by the open circles in Fig . 3 ( a ) , which is the MSD calculated exclu - sively from the constrained motion , ignoring the jumps . Thus , the viscoelastic properties of these constraining microenvironments are the same as those of the rest of the network . However , when the MSD is ensemble aver - aged over all particles , including the jumps , the power - law dependence is recovered , as shown by the solid FIG . 1 ( color online ) .

Thus , the anomalous diffusion re - sults from the dynamics of the jumps between local microenvironments . In order to quantify these dynamics , we determine the probability distribution of cage times (cid:1) c within the local microenvironments . For large cage times , this probability distribution function scales as a power law P (cid:2) (cid:1) c (cid:3) (cid:5) A(cid:1) (cid:11) (cid:17) c , as shown in Fig . 3 ( b ) . The normalization constant , A , is determined using the minimum cutoff time necessary for sufﬁcient statistics . To model this motion , we assume that the particle undergoes a random walk , but , unlike normal diffusive motion , the time scale of each step is chosen from a power - law distribution P (cid:2) (cid:1) c (cid:3) (cid:7) (cid:1) (cid:11) (cid:17) c . When the steps are chosen symmetrically and 1 < (cid:17) < 2 , this model predicts that the MSD should be subdiffusive , scaling asymptotically as (cid:2) (cid:5) (cid:17) (cid:11) 1 for uncorrelated jumps [ 21 ] . This relationship is in good agreement with our data for 0 : 25 (cid:5) m spheres in 0 : 9 mg = mL F - actin , as shown by the power - law ﬁt of (cid:2) (cid:5) 0 : 32 to the MSD in Fig . 3 ( a ) and the power - law ﬁt of (cid:17) (cid:5) 1 : 33 to the probability distribution function of waiting times in Fig . 3 ( b ) . Similar good agreement is obtained for other actin concentrations . A consequence of such a power - law distribution is that the mean cage time is not well deﬁned , consistent with our observation that a ma - jority of the particles remain constrained over the obser - vation time . The ensemble - averaged MSD of the tracers can di - rectly reveal the dynamical microstructure of the en - tangled actin network . To illustrate this , we determine the MSD of 0 : 25 (cid:5) m particles over a large range of actin concentrations . The exponent characterizing the subdif - fusive motion (cid:2) changed smoothly with the ratio of the particle radius a to the mesh size (cid:6) , as shown by the open squares in Fig . 4 . By using several different sized tracer particles varying from 0 : 25 – 0 : 5 (cid:5) m , we ﬁnd that (cid:2) de - pends only on the ratio of the bead size to the mesh size , rather than the actual bead radius or actin concentration as shown in Fig . 4 . Over a very narrow range , 0 : 42 < a = (cid:6) < 1 : 25 , we observe anomalous subdiffusion with (cid:2) decreasing rapidly as a function of a = (cid:6) . The steep de - crease of (cid:2) in this range shows that even small variations in a or in (cid:6) can have large effects on the bead mobility in a network . These results strikingly demonstrate that the actin network is inhomogeneous and that the subdiffusive motion is traplike ; thus , interpreting the MSD within the framework of microrheology must be done with extreme care for these particles . Instead , the particle motion re - ﬂects the dynamics of the network on length scales comparable to the particle size . While the residence time in the traps or pores is very long , jumps between pores are rapid ; their time scale is (cid:7) 0 : 5 s , while the distance between pores is (cid:7) 1 (cid:5) m . If the transport between pores were diffusive , the jump time would be (cid:7)(cid:2) 1 (cid:5) m (cid:3) 2 = D (cid:6) 2 s . Thus , the motion between pores may be diffusive in nature or , alternatively , the particle may be actively pushed into the new pore by a release of elastic energy of ﬁlaments in the network . The anomalous subdiffusion of the MSD is reminiscent of the power - law ﬂuctuations of individual actin ﬁlaments [ 7 ] ; however , any model for the particle motion that is restricted to such ﬂuctuations cannot account for the dependence of the exponent on a = (cid:6) . To describe this intermittent motion within a general framework , we for - mulate a model similar to that used to describe activation over a free energy barrier . We assume that the jumps between microenvironments are driven by elastic forces and are uncorrelated . Then , the waiting time distribution FIG . 4 ( color online ) .

Using the spectral representation of (cid:19) (cid:2) x (cid:3) [ 23 ] , an analytical expression for P (cid:2) (cid:1) (cid:3) can be ob - tained within the second cumulant approximation for the correlations of F (cid:2) (cid:1) (cid:3) ; this behaves asymptotically as P (cid:2) (cid:1) (cid:3) / (cid:11) dd(cid:1) h F (cid:2) (cid:1) (cid:3) F (cid:2) 0 (cid:3)i . We assume the elastic forces arise from coupling between the particle and the trans - verse ﬂuctuations of the actin ﬁlaments in the network ; since these have power - law correlations over time scales below (cid:7) 1 s [ 6 , 7 ] , we assume that F (cid:2) (cid:1) (cid:3) also has power - law correlations , h F (cid:2) (cid:1) (cid:3) F (cid:2) 0 (cid:3)i (cid:7) (cid:1) (cid:11) (cid:21) , and thus (cid:17) (cid:5) (cid:21) (cid:14) 1 . Despite the absence of precise information about the correlations of F , several qualitative conclusions can nevertheless be made . The exponent (cid:21) will decrease as the ratio of bead diameter to mesh size increases , since the larger size of the probe locally cuts off small length scales and rapid ﬂuctuations ; thus , (cid:21) will vary continu - ously . By contrast , microrheological models that relate subdiffusion to the elastic properties of the underlying network would not display this behavior [ 12 ] . In addition , we would expect the exponent (cid:21) to be relatively tempera - ture insensitive , so the temperature dependence of the subdiffusive exponent should be weaker than that pre - dicted by trap models based on activation over a broad distribution of energy barriers [ 24 ] . The transport behav - ior we observe may help account for rheological measure - ments of cells [ 25 ] which have been interpreted in terms of the ‘‘soft glassy rheology’’ model [ 26 ] . In this model , the standard temperature is replaced with an effective noise temperature , (cid:22) . Our experiments suggest that (cid:22) may be connected to the elastic energy stored locally in the actin network and thus related to the decay of the correlations of F (cid:2) (cid:1) (cid:3) . These results suggest that particle motions must be interpreted carefully , especially in materials where the structural length scale or dynamics are not well known . A judicious choice of particle sizes and concentrations can probe the dynamics of the surrounding entangled actin network on varying length scales , yielding information about the network elasticity , solvent viscosity , and micro - structure dynamics . Moreover , such cage - jumping behav - ior may also have implications for understanding the transport of proteins and macromolecular solutes through ‘‘crowded’’ cytoskeletal environments .
