Here , we report the regulation of host cell phosphatydilinositol 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) and pro - tein kinase B ( PKB / Akt ) activities by T . cruzi during parasite – host cell interaction .

A strong activation of PI3K and PKB / Akt activities in Vero cells was detected when these cells were incubated with trypomastigotes or their isolated membranes .

INTRODUCTION The intracellular protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi ( T . cruzi ) is the causative agent of Chagas’ dis - ease or American trypanosomiasis . In the mammalian host , trypomastigotes are the infective stage that in - vade host cells through the formation of a membrane - bounded vacuole . Soon after invasion , disruption of this vacuolar membrane allows parasites to reach the cytoplasm , where they differentiate into amastigotes and begin intracellular replication . Several lines of evidence have suggested that parasite attachment and invasion is a complex process in which multiple host and parasite molecules are required [ 1 ] . Moreover , T . cruzi internalization has been associated with recruit - ment and fusion of host cell lysosomes at the invasion site [ 2 ] , suggesting the activation of a signal transduc - tion pathway in the host cell . In addition to these ﬁndings , transient Ca 2 1 increases in the host cell have been detected when trypomastigotes or their isolated membranes were added to these cells [ 3 – 5 ] . These transient signals were associated with a yet unde - scribed trypomastigote membrane factor [ 6 ] . The Ca 2 1 signals were pertussis toxin - sensitive and mediated by phospholipase C , with concomitant inositol triphos - phate ( IP 3 ) formation [ 7 ] . Besides the phosphoinositide pathway involving IP 3 ( which in turn releases Ca 2 1 from intracellular stores ) and diacylglycerol , other phosphoinositides , such as phosphatidylinositol ( PI ) 3 - phosphate ( PIP ) , PI 3 , 4 - bi - phosphate ( PIP 2 ) , and PI 3 , 4 , 5 - triphosphate ( PIP 3 ) , have also been implicated in signaling roles [ 8 ] . Upon binding of hormones or growth factors to plasma mem - brane receptors , the levels of these lipids are rapidly increased in eukaryotic cells through the activity of phosphoinositide kinases . One of these kinases , PI3K , is a ubiquitously expressed enzyme that catalyses the phosphorylation of phosphoinositides at the D - 3 hy - droxyl of the myoinositol ring generating PIP , PIP 2 , and PIP 3 [ 9 ] . The form of PI3K involved in tyrosine kinase receptor signal transduction is composed of a regulatory 85 - kDa subunit and a catalytic 110 - kDa subunit [ 9 ] . On the other hand , several studies have indicated that the serine threonine kinase B ( PKB ) , also known as c - Akt , is one of the major targets of PI3K [ 10 , 11 ] . Activation of PKB / Akt occurs primarily by phosphorylation of Thr and Ser residues [ 12 ] and / or binding of PIP 2 [ 13 ] and involves translocation of the 1 The ﬁrst two authors contributed equally to this paper . 2 To whom correspondence and reprint requests should be ad - dressed at the Departamento de Microbiologı´a , Facultad de Medi - cina , Universidad de Buenos Aires , Paraguay 2155 Piso 13 , ( 1121 ) Buenos Aires , Argentina .

Both PI3K and PKB / Akt have been implicated in mitogenesis , vesicular trafﬁcking , and cell survival through signal transduc - tion mechanisms [ 14 ] . Recent reports on the activation of the host cell PI3K or PKB / Akt pathway by patho - genic bacteria [ 15 , 16 ] , lipopolysaccharide [ 16 , 17 ] , or certain viruses [ 18 , 19 ] have shown that these patho - gens or their isolated molecules can subvert host cell signal transduction pathways and modify the course of parasite survival . In the present work , we have studied the involvement of host PI3K and PKB / Akt in the process of T . cruzi invasion . Our ﬁndings show that parasitic molecules present in the plasma membrane of trypomastigotes trigger activation signals for host PI3K and PKB / Akt . These signals are undoubtedly associated with infectivity since membranes from the noninfective epimastigote stage were unable to induce any effect . The activation of host PI3K and PKB / Akt is a requisite for successful infection by T . cruzi , since parasite invasion is strongly reduced when this path - way is blocked by selective inhibitors or inactive mu - tant cells . Besides , a participation of a T . cruzi’s PI3K - like in host cell invasion indicates that common pathways in the parasite and the host cell are mutually involved . MATERIALS AND METHODS Chemicals . Polyclonal antibodies to PI3K a - p85 and to PKB / Akt were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc . ( Santa Cruz , CA ) . The lipid substrate phosphatidylinositol was obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids ( Alabaster , GA ) . Wortmannin and LY290042 were purchased from BIOMOL ( Plymouth Meeting , PA ) and dis - solved in dimethyl sulfoxide . All working solutions were prepared immediately before use and sterilized through a 0 . 22 - m m - pore - size ﬁlter . Protein A – Sepharose beads , protease inhibitors , and all other reagents were from Sigma ( St . Louis , MO ) . Mammalian cells and parasites . Infection experiments were per - formed using the nonphagocytic cell lines Vero ( African green mon - key kidney cells ) L 6 E 9 myoblasts , and NIH3T3 ﬁbroblasts . Human and murine J774 macrophages were used as phagocytic cells . Vero , L 6 E 9 and NIH 3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco’s minimal essential medium ( DMEM ) containing 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) , at 37°C with 5 % CO 2 . NIH3T3 cells transiently expressing wild - type , active , and inactive PKB / Akt - hemagglutinin ( HA ) constructs were generated by using the pcDNA3 vector as described previously [ 20 ] . Human peripheral blood monocyte - derived macrophages were prepared as described [ 21 ] . J774 macrophages were grown in alpha - minimal essential me - dium ( MEM ) containing 10 % FBS at 37°C with 5 % CO 2 . T . cruzi epimastigotes of the acute RA lethal strain [ 22 ] were cultured in biphasic medium at 28°C as previously described [ 23 ] . Trypomastigotes from the same strain were obtained from the cul - ture medium of irradiated Vero cells following the method described by Moreno et al . [ 4 ] . This method yields 95 % pure trypomastigotes with minor contamination of amastigotes . Final concentrations of parasites were determined using a Neubauer chamber . T . cruzi membrane fraction . T . cruzi trypomastigote and epimas - tigote membranes were prepared as previously described [ 5 ] . Brieﬂy , parasites at a concentration of 1 3 10 8 / ml were washed twice and resuspended in phosphate buffer solution plus 1 % bovine serum albumin ( PBS – BSA ) containing the following protease inhibitors : 0 . 01 % leupeptin ; 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride ; 25 U / ml apro - tinin ; 1 mM benzamidine , 0 . 2 mg / ml soybean trypsin inhibitor , and 0 . 5 mM tosyl - L - lysine chloromethyl ketone . Parasites were disrupted by four freeze – thaw cycles and centrifuged at 14 , 000 g for 10 min at 4°C . The supernatant was further centrifuged at 105 , 000 g for 1 h at 4°C and the pellet containing the microsomal fraction was resus - pended in PBS – BSA , aliquoted at 1 3 10 8 parasite equivalents / ml , and stored at 2 70°C . This fraction was further used as the parasite membrane fraction in the PI3K and PKB / Akt assays and contained 15 m g of protein per 1 3 10 8 trypomastigotes . PI3K assay . To determine PI3K activity , 3 3 10 6 Vero cells were washed twice with ice - cold PBS and lysed in modiﬁed RIPA buffer [ 50 mM Tris – HCl , pH 7 . 4 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM Na 3 VO 4 , 1 % NP - 40 , 1 mM EDTA , and protease inhibitors ( 0 . 01 % leupeptin ; 2 mM phe - nylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride ; 25 U / ml aprotinin , 1 mM benzamidine ; 0 . 2 mg / ml soybean trypsin inhibitor ) , 1 mM NaF , 10 mM b - glycero - phosphate ] by incubation in a rocker shaker for 15 min at 4°C . Cells were removed from the plate with a cell scraper and were centrifuged at 14 , 000 g for 15 min at 4°C . The supernatants were incubated overnight at 4°C with a - p85 PI3K antibody . Protein A – Sepharose beads ( 40 m l ) were added to each tube and incubated for 2 h at 4°C with constant agitation . The immunoprecipitates were washed once by centrifugation with RIPA buffer , twice with 100 mM Tris , pH 7 . 5 , 0 . 1 mM LiCl , 1 mM Na 3 VO 4 , and twice with TNE ( 10 mM Tris , 150 mM NaCl , 5 mM EDTA , 0 . 1 mM Na 3 VO 4 ) and ﬁnally resuspended in 50 m l of TNE buffer . Sonicated PI ( 10 m l of 2 mg / ml in 10 mM Tris – HCl , pH 7 . 4 , 1 mM EGTA ) , 10 m Ci of [ g - 32 P ] ATP , 10 m l of 100 mM MgCl 2 , and 10 m l of 100 mM MnCl 2 were added and the samples were incubated for 15 min at 37°C . The reaction was stopped by the addition of 20 m l of 6 N HCl and 160 m l of chloroform : methanol ( 1 : 1 ) . After the tubes were vortexed , the organic phase was extracted and centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 min at room temperature . Samples were applied to potassium oxalate - treated thin - layer chromatogra - phy ( TLC ) plates and developed using a solvent system of CHCl 3 : CH 3 OH : H 2 O : NH 4 OH ( 60 : 47 : 11 . 3 : 2 ) . Dried TLC plates were exposed to an autoradiography ﬁlm and the PIP spots were identiﬁed with authentic standards and quantitated by densitometry using the NIH Image Program or excising the spot and scintillation counting [ 24 ] . This assay was performed with unstimulated Vero cells ( control ) , Vero cells stimulated with 100 nM EGF ( epidermal growth factor ) ( positive control ) , parasite membrane - stimulated cells , and cells pre - viously treated with LY294002 and stimulated with a trypomasti - gote membrane fraction . Parasite membranes ( from 1 3 10 8 para - sites ) used in each point were equivalent to 15 m g of protein . In all cases , parallel samples were processed for protein immunoblot using the same a - p85 PI3K antibody to verify that equivalent amounts of enzyme were present in each experimental point . PKB / Akt assay . For the determination of PKB activity , the method of Kohn et al . was used [ 20 ] . For these immune complex kinase assays , Vero cells were cultured , stimulated , washed , and lysed exactly as described for PI3K assays . After a 3 - h incubation at 4°C with 5 m l of the anti - PKB antibody followed by an overnight incubation with 20 m l of protein A – agarose , the immunoprecipitates were washed twice with lysis buffer ( 25 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 9 , protease inhibitors , 1 % Triton X - 100 , 150 mM NaCl , 10 mM b - glycerophos - phate , and 1 mM Na 3 VO 4 ) and twice with kinase buffer ( 25 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 9 , 10 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM MnCl 2 ) . Reactions were done in 25 m l of kinase buffer containing 1 m l of histone H2A ( 1 mg / ml ) and 1 m l of [ g - 32 P ] ATP ( 10 mCi / ml ) and incubated at 30°C for 20 min . Reactions were terminated by addition of 3 3 Laemmli buffer . Sam - ples were boiled and proteins were separated by SDS – polyacrylam - ide gel electrophoresis ( PAGE ) ( 12 % gel ) . Phosphorylated PKB was visualized by autoradiography and quantiﬁed by densitometry as in the PI3K assays . In all cases , parallel samples were processed for protein immunoblot using the same PKB antibody to verify that 212 WILKOWSKY ET AL . equivalent amounts of enzyme were present in each experimental point . Cell invasion assay . Cell culture trypomastigotes were washed twice in DMEM 1 10 % FBS and resuspended in the same medium at 1 3 10 7 parasites / ml . Mammalian cells were seeded on coverslips in 24 - well plates and grown for 24 h . The cells ( 1 3 10 5 / well ) were treated for 1 h at 37°C with LY 294002 ( 50 and 100 m M ) or Wort - mannin ( 1 , 10 , 100 , and 500 nM ) . Nontreated cells as well as cells incubated with DMSO in the assay concentrations were used as controls . After extensive washing , cells were infected with trypomas - tigotes ( 1 3 10 6 / well ) for 2 h at 37°C . Coverslips were washed twice with the same medium to remove unbound parasites and cells were incubated for 24 h at 37°C with 5 % CO 2 . To determine the percentage of infected cells , four coverslips of each point were washed twice with PBS , ﬁxed with absolute methanol , and stained with Giemsa . Infec - tion was determined microscopically , evaluating the percentage of infected cells containing intracellular amastigotes and counting no fewer than 500 cells at random [ 5 ] . Immunoﬂuorescence confocal microscopy . For morphological analysis by immunoﬂuorescence confocal microscopy , cells overex - pressing either the wild type or the active or inactive mutant of PKB / Akt were grown on 12 - mm round coverslips in 12 - well microtest plates and transfected as described earlier [ 20 ] . After transfection the cells were ﬁxed in 80 mM Pipes ( Sigma ) , pH 6 . 8 , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 25 M sucrose , 5 mM EGTA , and 3 % ( w / v ) paraformaldehyde . After 20 - min ﬁxation at room temperature , the cells were washed twice with PBS and then incubated for 20 min with 50 mM NH 4 Cl in PBS . The coverslips were then placed with the cells facing down on Paraﬁlm containing 30 - m l droplets of 20 % goat serum in PBS and incubated in a humidiﬁed chamber at room temperature for 30 min . The overexpressed tagged HA - PKB / Akt proteins were visualized with an afﬁnity - puriﬁed mouse anti - HA monoclonal antibody , whereas T . cruzi was visualized with an anti - T . cruzi rabbit poly - clonal serum . After the incubation with the ﬁrst antibody , the cov - erslips were washed three times for 15 min with 500 m l PBS and then incubated for 30 min at room temperature with rhodamine - labeled goat anti - mouse IgG antibodies and ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate - la - beled goat anti - rabbit IgG antibodies ( both from Sigma ) . After the incubation with the second antibody , the coverslips were washed three times for 15 min with 500 m l PBS and mounted on 4 m l of mounting medium on a microscopy slide . Control experiments were carried out to ensure that the antibodies did not cross - react . The cells were viewed in a confocal scanning beam ﬂuorescence microscope at excitation wavelengths of 476 and 529 nm , respectively . Statistical analysis . Statistical analysis was determined by Stu - dent’s t test and signiﬁcance was considered P , 0 . 05 . RESULTS PI3K Inhibitors Block T . cruzi Invasion in Host Cells To determine the effect of the PI3K inhibitors in the invasion process of T . cruzi , macrophages and nonph - agocytic cells were incubated with the PI3K inhibitors Wortmannin and LY294002 prior to infection , as de - scribed under Materials and Methods . As shown in Fig . 1A , invasion of Vero , L 6 E 9 , and NIH3T3 cells by trypo - mastigotes was greatly inhibited by pretreatment of host cells with different concentrations of LY294002 . The results showed a dose - dependent pattern of inhi - bition , with maximal percentages calculated between 75 . 5 and 96 % for the three cell lines ( P , 0 . 05 ) . Vero and NIH 3T3 cells were the most sensitive to the effect of this inhibitor since approximately 90 % inhibition was obtained with the lowest concentration tested ( 50 m M ) ( Fig . 1A ) . Similar results were obtained with the three cell lines when Wortmannin , the structurally unrelated PI3K inhibitor , was used ( Fig . 1B ) . We also determined the effect of both PI3K inhibitors in the invasion process of T . cruzi in human macrophages and the murine phagocytic cell line J774 . Furthermore , Wortmannin was a potent inhibitor of the invasion of human and murine macrophages by T . cruzi ( Fig . 2A ) and this inhibitory effect was dose dependent . Similar results were also obtained with LY294002 in both mac - rophage cell types ( Fig . 2B ) . FIG . 1 . Inhibition of T . cruzi invasion in nonphagocytic cells by PI3K - speciﬁc inhibitors . ( A ) Vero ( ) , L 6 E 9 ( f ) , and NIH3T3 ( h ) cells were incubated in DMEM alone ( control ) or plus 50 or 100 m M LY294002 for 1 h . After incubation , cells were washed and infected with cell - cultured trypomastigotes ( parasite cell ratio 10 : 1 ) for 2 h . Infection percentages were determined 24 h postin - fection , as described under Materials and Methods . Values shown are the mean 6 SD of three independent experiments . ( B ) Vero ( ) , L 6 E 9 ( f ) , and NIH3T3 ( h ) cells were incubated in DMEM alone ( control ) or plus 1 , 10 , 100 , or 500 nM Wortmannin for 1 h . After incubation , cells were washed and infected with cell - cultured trypomastigotes ( parasite cell ratio 10 : 1 ) for 2 h . Infection percentages were determined 24 h postinfection , as de - scribed under Materials and Methods . Values shown are the mean 6 SD of three independent experiments . 213 PI 3 - KINASE , PKB / Akt IN T . cruzi INFECTION Activation of Host PI3K and PKB / Akt Activities by Trypomastigote Membranes Based on the results that PI3K inhibitors blocked T . cruzi entry in host cells , we queried whether activation of this kinase could be triggered by trypomastigote membranes in contact with mammalian cells . Vero cells were stimulated with trypomastigote membranes and PI3K activity was evaluated by immunoprecipita - tion of cell lysates and PIP product quantitation as described under Materials and Methods . As shown in Fig . 3 , contact of Vero cells with trypomastigote mem - branes for 10 min induced a 10 - fold increase in enzyme activity compared with unstimulated cells ( Fig . 3 , lane A vs lane B ) . Treatment of cells for 1 h with 50 m M LY294002 before the addition of parasitic membranes abolished the stimulatory effect of this fraction ( Fig . 3 , lane C ) . Similar results were obtained when cells were pretreated for the same period with 10 nM Wortman - nin ( data not shown ) . Concentrations of both inhibi - tors , which gave the maximal inhibition of invasion ( Figs . 1A and 1B ) , were used . In order to determine if the activation of host cell PI3K by trypomastigote membranes was speciﬁc for this infective stage , paral - lel experiments were performed using membranes ob - tained from the noninfective epimastigote stage . The results showed that these membranes were unable to induce any PIK3 activation in host cells ( Fig . 3 , lane D ) , suggesting that only infective trypomastigote mem - branes are able to activate host cell PI3K . Similar results to these described in Fig . 3 were also obtained FIG . 3 . T . cruzi activates PI3K in Vero cells . Cells were starved of FBS for 18 h prior to PI3K stimulation . PI3K activity was mea - sured in control cells ( lane A ) or in cells ( in the absence of serum ) incubated for 10 min with T . cruzi membranes prepared from either trypomastigotes ( lane B ) or epimastigotes ( lane C ) . In lane D , 50 m M LY294002 was added to the cells for 1 h before stimulation with T . cruzi trypomastigote membranes . After all treatments , cell lysates were prepared and were immunoprecipitated with an anti - p85 PI3K antibody . PI3K activity in the immunoprecipitate was then mea - sured . The experiment was repeated three times with similar re - sults . An anti - PI3K blot is shown as a loading control . FIG . 2 . Inhibition of T . cruzi invasion in phagocytic cells by PI3K selective inhibitors . ( A ) J774 ( f ) and human ( h ) macrophages were incubated in DMEM alone ( control ) or plus 1 , 10 , 100 , or 500 nM Wortmannin for 1 h . After incubation , cells were washed and infected with cell - cultured trypomastigotes ( parasite cell ratio 10 : 1 ) for 2 h . Infection percentages were determined 24 h postinfection , as described under Materials and Methods . Values shown are the mean 6 SD of three independent experiments . ( B ) J774 ( f ) and human ( h ) macrophages were incubated in DMEM alone ( control ) or plus 50 or 100 m M LY294002 for 1 h . After incubation , cells were washed and infected with cell - cultured trypomastigotes ( parasite cell ratio 10 : 1 ) for 2 h . Infection percentages were determined 24 h postinfec - tion , as described under Materials and Methods . Values shown are the mean 6 SD of three independent experiments . 214 WILKOWSKY ET AL . when intact parasites were incubated with host cells ( data not shown ) . On the other hand , to evaluate the kinetics of acti - vation of PI3K by trypomastigote membranes com - pared with a normal growth factor and to determine the magnitude of the response to both stimuli , we per - formed a time course experiment with parasite mem - branes and EGF ( as a PI3K known activator ) . The results shown in Fig . 4 indicate that parasite activa - tion followed a time course pattern with maximal ac - tivity at 10 min ; meanwhile , EGF showed a more rapid response ( 5 min ) but of a less magnitude ( 100 % vs 80 % , respectively ) . The activation was time dependent and the level of PI3K at 60 min was very similar to the basal levels ( data not shown ) . PKB / Akt is widely accepted as a PI3K downstream target [ 11 ] . To conﬁrm this hypothesis , the kinase ac - tivity of Vero cell PKB / Akt after stimulation with T . cruzi membranes was analyzed by immunoprecipita - tion with anti - PKB / Akt antibodies . The results shown in Fig . 5 indicate that , as observed with PI3K , only trypomastigote but not epimastigote membranes in - duced PKB / Akt activation . In order to examine if T . cruzi invasion was also regulated by the overexpression of PKB / Akt active or inactive kinase mutants , infection experiments with further antibody labeling and confocal microscopy analysis were performed with PKB - transfected cells . The results shown in Fig . 6 indicate that the overex - pression of wild - type or constitutively activated PKB / Akt increases T . cruzi invasion ( P , 0 . 05 ) . In contrast , the overexpression of the inactive mutant PKB / Akt signiﬁcantly blocked T . cruzi invasion ( P , 0 . 05 ) ( Fig . 6 ) . T . cruzi’s PI3K Activity Is Also Involved in Host Cell Invasion To determine if T . cruzi PI3K could also have a role in host cell invasion , trypomastigotes were treated with Wortmannin and then were added to Vero cells . Infection percentages were recorded as described un - der Materials and Methods . In the concentrations used none of these compounds affected parasite viability , as determined by trypan blue dye staining and cell motil - ity . As seen with mammalian cells , treatment of para - sites with Wortmannin resulted in a signiﬁcant dose - dependent inhibition of parasite entry ( P , 0 . 05 ) ( Fig . 7 ) . FIG . 4 . Kinetics of PI3K activation by T . cruzi membranes and EGF . PI3K activity was measured in Vero cells stimulated with trypomastigote membranes ( ) at different times ( 5 , 10 , and 25 min ) , as in Fig . 3 . A positive control ( EGF 100 nM ) ( h ) was added in another set of cells at the same times . After all treatments , cell lysates were prepared and were immunoprecipitated with an anti - p85 PI3K antibody . PI3K activity in the immunoprecipitate was then measured . The experiment was repeated three times with similar results . FIG . 5 . T . cruzi activates PKB / Akt in Vero cells . Cells were starved of FBS for 18 h prior to stimulation . PKB / Akt activity was measured in control cells ( lane C ) or in cells incubated for 10 min with T . cruzi membranes prepared from trypomastigotes ( lane T ) or epimastigotes ( lane E ) . As in Fig . 3 , cell lysates were then immuno - precipitated with an anti - PKB / Akt antibody and the PKB / Akt kinase activity was measured as described under Materials and Methods . Histone 2A ( H2A ) was used as a substrate for PKB / Akt . The exper - iment was repeated three times with similar results . An anti - PKB blot is shown as a loading control . FIG . 6 . PKB / Akt overexpression modulates T . cruzi infection in NIH3T3 cells . NIH3T3 cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA3 containing a wild type , an inactive mutant and a positive constitutively activated form of PKB / Akt , or the vector alone . The transfected cells were infected with T . cruzi trypomastigotes for 2 h and ﬁxed . The level of infection was determined by immunoﬂuores - cence as described under Materials and Methods . 215 PI 3 - KINASE , PKB / Akt IN T . cruzi INFECTION DISCUSSION Numerous studies using genetics , PI3K inhibitors , and PI3K overexpression have implicated this enzyme in the regulation of cell proliferation , survival , metab - olism , cytoskeletal reorganization , and membrane traf - ﬁcking [ 25 ] . One well - established target of PI3K acti - vation is PKB / Akt , also called PKB [ 26 , 27 ] . PKB / Akt is thought to play an important role in protecting cells from apoptosis and in promoting cell survival [ 28 ] . The present report provides substantive evidence for the involvement of host signal transducing molecules like PI3K and PKB / Akt during T . cruzi invasion of phago - cytic and nonphagocytic cells . Our results show that the PI3K inhibitors Wortmannin and LY294002 signif - icantly reduced the extent of T . cruzi infection in mac - rophagic and nonmacrophagic cells ( Figs . 1 and 2 ) . Simultaneously with the revision of this paper , Todorov et al . [ 29 ] have reported similar results , but using peritoneal macrophages . Vero cells were highly sensitive to the effects of both compounds , although the concentration necessary to inhibit at least 50 % inva - sion was shown to be higher for T . cruzi than for Listeria monocytogenes [ 30 ] . Both PI3K inhibitors sig - niﬁcantly reduced T . cruzi invasion in a dose - depen - dent fashion , as reported for L . monocytogenes [ 30 ] . In agreement with our results , Wortmannin has been shown to inhibit infection by another parasitic proto - zoan , Cryptosporidium parvum , in epithelial cells [ 31 ] . The observation that both compounds were strong in - hibitors of parasite invasion at concentrations that are known to inhibit only PI3K [ 32 , 33 ] indicates that this host enzyme could be part of a signaling pathway re - quired for successful infection . As seen with other sig - nal transduction molecules like Ca 2 1 , the PI3K / PKB cascade could be a common pathway used by several pathogens to invade and survive within host cells . Dur - ing T . cruzi infection , parasite contact with nonphago - cytic cells is associated with changes in the actin cy - toskeleton [ 7 ] and the migration of host cell lysosomes to the invasion site [ 2 ] . PI3K activity may be involved in the regulation of actin microﬁlament formation and a role of this enzyme in actin cytoskeleton reorganiza - tion cannot be excluded [ 9 ] . Activation of host PI3K leads to the production of phosphorylated PI , which can activate several downstream targets , including PKB / Akt [ 12 , 24 , 25 ] . Our ﬁndings showing that the activation of host PI3K and PKB / Akt by a membrane fraction isolated from the infective trypomastigotes , coupled with the absence of enzyme activation by the noninfective epimastigote stage ( Figs . 3 – 5 ) , suggest that the membrane fraction contains the factor ( s ) that facilitates T . cruzi invasion . The kinetics of the PI3K activation induced by trypomastigote membranes re - sulted in a pattern similar to that of a well - known activator of this enzyme as EGF , although the response to the parasitic membranes was higher and sustained during a longer period ( Fig . 4 ) . Parasitic membranes constituted a good approach to studying the biochemi - cal changes in host cells associated with parasite inva - sion since activating molecules are probably located on the parasite surface . To date the trypomastigote mol - ecules that cause the signaling processes described above are still largely unknown . We are currently in - vestigating the nature of this factor ( s ) . Many signaling molecules that activate host cell in - tracellular cascades have been described from various pathogenic microorganisms [ 15 – 19 ] . Only one mole - cule , trans - sialidase ( or gp83 ) , has been reported to have a role in upregulation of invasion through host MAP kinases during T . cruzi infection [ 34 ] . On the other hand , parasite attachment is a complex process that leads to activation of parasitic signaling pathways as well , even within the host cell . Ca 2 1 sig - nals have been detected in trypomastigotes when they became associated with mammalian cells [ 5 ] and these increments in Ca 2 1 ﬂux were related to an increased infective capacity [ 35 ] . Since molecules involved in sig - nal transduction are common in the parasite and in the host cell , we investigated T . cruzi PI3K participation in host cell invasion . Here , we show for the ﬁrst time that T . cruzi PI3K - like activity is required in trypomastig - otes for their invasion into host cells , since treatment of parasites with Wortmannin resulted in dose - depen - dent inhibition of invasion in Vero cells ( Fig . 6 ) . Finally , in this work we have shown that T . cruzi trypomastigotes are able to activate the host PI3K / FIG . 7 . PI3K inhibitors affects T . cruzi infectivity in Vero cells . T . cruzi cell - cultured trypomastigotes were incubated in DMEM alone ( control ) or medium plus the indicated Wortmannin concen - trations for 1 h . After incubation , parasites were washed by sedi - mentation and added to monolayers of Vero cells ( parasite cell ratio 10 : 1 ) for 2 h . The infection percentages were recorded 24 h postin - fection , as described under Materials and Methods . Values shown are the mean 6 SD of three independent experiments . 216 WILKOWSKY ET AL . PKB / Akt cascade . There could be two possible hypoth - eses for the parasite activation of these host cell signal transduction pathways . First , PI3K and PKB / Akt are known to couple the initiation of endocytic membrane trafﬁcking via Rab 5 function , the rate - limiting endo - somal GTPase [ 36 – 38 ] . This would explain the higher infection percentages obtained with the PKB / Akt - pos - itive cells in which endocytic trafﬁcking is increased . In this sense , an enhanced T . cruzi invasion has been detected in Rab - 5 - transfected cells ( Wilkowsky et al . , personal communication ) . Second , PKB / Akt has been shown to phosphorylate BAD [ 39 , 40 ] , which repre - sents a key anti - apoptotic signal in the host cell . The upregulation of these enzymes could be considered a parasitic strategy for preserving host cell life and al - lowing parasites to establish a secure environment for their survival and propagation .
