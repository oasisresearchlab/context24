Volume 29 November 26 , 2018 2959 MBoC | ARTICLE 4D cell biology : big data image analytics and lattice light - sheet imaging reveal dynamics of clathrin - mediated endocytosis in stem cell – derived intestinal organoids ABSTRACT New methods in stem cell 3D organoid tissue culture , advanced imaging , and big data image analytics now allow tissue - scale 4D cell biology , but currently available analytical pipelines are inadequate for handing and analyzing the resulting gigabytes and terabytes of high - content imaging data . We expressed fluorescent protein fusions of clathrin and dyna - min2 at endogenous levels in genome - edited human embryonic stem cells ( hESCs ) , which were differentiated into hESC - derived intestinal epithelial organoids . Lattice light - sheet im - aging with adaptive optics ( AO - LLSM ) allowed us to image large volumes of these organoids ( 70 × 60 × 40 µm xyz ) at 5 . 7 s / frame . We developed an open - source data analysis package termed pyLattice to process the resulting large ( ∼ 60 GB ) movie data sets and to track clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) events . CME tracks could be recorded from ∼ 35 cells at a time , resulting in ∼ 4000 processed tracks per movie . On the basis of their localization in the organ - oid , we classified CME tracks into apical , lateral , and basal events and found that CME dynamics is similar for all three classes , despite reported differences in membrane tension . pyLattice coupled with AO - LLSM makes possible quantitative high temporal and spatial resolution analysis of subcellular events within tissues . INTRODUCTION Quantitative cell biology aims to understand cellular processes by studying cells and tissues under conditions that recapitulate the in vivo environment as closely as possible . Recent advances in the fields of 1 ) stem cells and 3D organoid culture ( Figure 1A ) , 2 ) ad - vanced fluorescence imaging ( Figure 1B ) , and 3 ) big data image analytics ( Figure 1C ) are now coming together to unlock a new level of temporal and spatial detail for this research : 4D cell biology . In this article we present the development of critical software and technology to enable 4D cell biology and describe how we applied it to investigate clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) . Stem cell and intestinal organoid technologies have advanced rapidly since the intestinal stem cell was first validated by in vivo lineage tracing ( Barker et al . , 2007 ) , and in vitro intestinal organoid culture systems were first reported in 2009 ( Ootani et al . , 2009 ; Sato et al . , 2009 ) . While the first of these cultures were derived from ani - mal models , they can now also be grown from human tissues , em - bryonic stem cells , and induced pluripotent stem cells ( iPSCs ) ( Sato et al . , 2011 ; Spence et al . , 2011 ; Forster et al . , 2014 ; McCracken et al . , 2014 ; Crespo et al . , 2017 ) . Today , stem cells can be differenti - ated into tissues as diverse and complicated as taste buds , stomach , liver , pancreas , inner ear , kidney , and brain ( Fatehullah et al . , 2016 ) . Organoids differ from tissue aggregates and cocultures in that they contain multiple cell types that develop from stem cells or organ progenitors and comprise lineage - committed cells that self - organize and possess some function of the respective tissue in vivo ( Lancaster and Knoblich , 2014 ) .

Schöneberg et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell methods in general , allow unprecedented research opportunities by bringing research away from individual cells or layers of cells grown on a plastic or glass surface and toward differentiated 3D tissues , as reviewed in Clevers ( 2016 ) . While organoids have allowed cell culture to move into the third dimension with live 3D tissue cultures , imaging these cultures using existing approaches to microscopy remained challenging . Conven - tional fluorescence microscopy has been an indispensable tool for studying cell biology , but has had severe limitations . For example , laser powers required for sensitive imaging in confocal microscopy can cause bleaching and phototoxicity , which limits live cell imaging to low frame rates , short observation times , and imaging in a single plane ( 2D ) . The recent advent of lattice light - sheet microscopy ( LLSM ) ( Chen et al . , 2014 ) addresses these limitations : extremely fast image acquisition and low phototoxicity allow nearly bleaching - free imaging of live cells for tens of minutes in 3D . Importantly , the recent combina - tion of adaptive optics with lattice light - sheet technology ( AO - LLSM ) ( Liu et al . , 2018 ) is ideally suited for tissue imaging tasks , as tissue - induced aberrations can be corrected , resulting in 4D movies ( three space dimensions and time ) with previously unachievable clarity . With live 3D organoid cultures and the possibility of imaging them in 4D using AO - LLSM , only one challenge remains : the large amounts of data generated by the novel imaging technique . Semi - manual analysis , as is usually done for 2D data sets that are in the size range of hundreds of megabytes , such as through ImageJ / Fiji ( Schindelin et al . , 2012 ; Rueden et al . , 2017 ) , becomes prohibitive for the gigabytes and terabytes of 4D imaging data sets . Sophisti - cated analysis algorithms ( Jaqaman et al . , 2008 ; Aguet et al . , 2016 ) and 4D visualization tools ( Goddard et al . , 2018 ) are required , as well as new thinking about data storage ( Cheeseman et al . , 2018 ) and how best to apply machine learning ( Hong et al . , 2015 ; Ounkomol et al . , 2018 ) . In this paper , existing tools were adapted and paired with new code , resulting in the pyLattice package . Building on a core of proven particle - tracking tools ( Jaqaman et al . , 2008 ; Aguet et al . , 2016 ) , pyLattice operates on the widely used open - source scientific computing framework Jupyter ( Perez and Granger , 2007 ) and interfaces with the novel open - source 4D LLSM viewer ChimeraX ( Goddard et al . , 2018 ) . The resulting code fea - tures a user - friendly Python interface , support for large AO - LLSM data sets , and support for membrane detection , membrane classi - fication into basal , apical , and lateral , and assignment of molecule detections to these specific membranes . pyLattice is open source and aims to be a general tool for 4D LLSM data analytics . We used all three aspects of 4D cell biology ( 3D tissue culture , 4D imaging , and advanced image analytics ) to study clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) . CME is an ubiquitous and essential process in the cell that controls lipid homeostasis , receptor internalization , and cell signaling ( Kaksonen and Roux , 2018 ) . The pathway involves the FIGURE 1 : ( Left ) A new level of 4D tissue cell biology is unlocked as recent advances from three fields come together : ( A ) endogenous protein tagging using genome editing ( i ) , stem cell biology ( ii ) , and 3D tissue / organoid culture ( iii ) ; ( B ) 4D noninvasive advanced fluorescence imaging with a lattice light - sheet microscope with adaptive optics ( AO - LLSM ; left : full view of the microscope ; right : focus on the characteristic objective arrangement ) ; and ( C ) advances and software in big data image analytics . ( Right ) Combination of these elements allows unprecedented quantitative analysis of subcellular events within live tissues in 4D . Volume 29 November 26 , 2018 LLSM , pyLattice reveal CME in organoids | 2961 assembly of a clathrin ( Cltr ) coat on the plasma membrane through sequential recruitment of proteins . The coated membrane bends to - ward the inside of the cell , recruiting additional membrane - bending factors ( Schöneberg et al . , 2017 ) and eventually forming an invagination that is only connected to the bulk plasma membrane by a small neck . At this stage , the GTPase dynamin2 ( Dnm2 ) is recruited to the neck and cleaves it . The freed clathrin - coated vesicle is then further internalized and uncoated for processing . Using genome - engineered human embryonic stem cells , we have previously shown that CME dynamics is highly adapted to the needs of different cell types ( Dambournet et al . , 2018 ) . Over the past few decades , CME studies have been focused on the ventral part of the cell nearest the coverslip surface , which can be accessed easily by total internal re - flection fluorescence microscopy ( TIRFM ) . Recent studies started to access the dorsal part of cells grown on coverslips ( Aguet et al . , 2016 ) and investigated CME in polarized cells such as Madin – Darby canine kidney ( MDCK ) cells adherent to a surface ( Boulant et al . , 2011 ) . Most recently , CME was investigated in migrating cells ( Kurl et al . , 2015 ) , in live 3D fruitfly embryos ( Ferguson et al . , 2016 ) , in native 3D zebrafish tissue of nonpolarized cells , and in organoids ( Liu et al . , 2018 ) . The tools of 4D cell biology allow us , for the first time , to inves - tigate CME in a well - controlled 3D human polarized - tissue con - text . First , we engineered human embryonic stem cells to express fluorescent protein – tagged versions of the critical CME proteins Cltr and Dnm2 from their endogenous genomic loci and at endog - enous protein levels ( Figure 1A , i and ii ) . Cells were differentiated into 3D intestinal epithelial organoids ( Figure 1Aiii ) that allow the cells to be observed in their self - assembled 3D architecture . AO - LLSM imaging ( Figure 1B ) revealed the full dynamics of the CME process throughout the 3D structure of the undisturbed organoids . In particular , it allowed us to investigate protein dynamics simulta - neously at all membranes of a cell within a 3D organoid . Finally , we developed and used pyLattice for data analysis and quantification ( Figure 1C ) to reveal CME dynamics at apical , lateral , and basal membranes . The developed pipeline for data analysis and the py - Lattice package are open source and freely available . RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Clathrin ( Cltr ) and dynamin2 ( Dnm2 ) were endogenously tagged with TagRFP and eGFP , respectively , in hESCs ( Figure 2A ) . hESCs were differentiated into 3D intestinal epithelial organoids ( Forster et al . , 2014 ) . In this protocol , hESCs were cultured to confluence and then injected subcutaneously into immune - compromised mice for teratoma development . Grown teratomas were harvested after 6 – 8 wk and embedded into undiluted Matrigel droplets in media conditioned with intestinal growth factors ( Wnt3a , epider - mal growth factor [ EGF ] , Noggin , R - Spondin - 1 [ WENR ] ) for 1 wk to develop intestinal epithelial organoids . These organoids can be differentiated into all major cell types by reducing Wnt3a in the media and by the addition of DAPT . However , when cultured in media with high concentrations of Wnt3a , the organoids can be passaged long - term , and they consist of a single layer of intestinal epithelial cells comprising mostly adult stem / progenitor cells with a low frequency of spontaneous differentiation ( Forster et al . , 2014 ) . The organoids assume the form of a cystic sphere that sur - rounds a fluid - filled lumen ( Figure 2B ) . Intestinal epithelial cells within the organoids are highly polarized with an actin cortex on the apical membrane and microvilli characteristic of the intestinal brush border ( Forster et al . , 2014 ) . Moreover , the intestinal nature of these organoids was confirmed by transcriptional profiling ( Forster et al . , 2014 ) . For each cell , three membrane classes can be defined : the apical ( lumen - facing ) side , the basal ( outside - facing ) side , and the lateral membranes that separate cells from each other in the organoid ( Figure 2C ) . Lattice light - sheet imaging with adaptive optics ( AO - LLSM ; Liu et al . , 2018 ) was used to reveal the 4D dynamics of CME in the live organoids . The large 3D field of view ( 68 × 58 × 40 µm , xyz ; pixel size 0 . 097 µm in xy , 0 . 2 µm in z ) allowed us to image through the organoid’s epithelial cell layer ( Figure 2D ) and to capture Cltr and Dnm2 dynamics on apical , basal , and lateral membranes with a frame rate of 2 . 85 s / frame per channel . The field of view allowed the simultaneous observation of multiple cells at a time ( 36 cells in Figure 2E ) . Punctate structures , corresponding to clathrin - coated vesicles and Dnm2 accumulations , were visible throughout the tis - sue layer in all three dimensions ( Figure 2 , F – K ) . An overlay of the puncta revealed structures that contained both Cltr and Dnm2 ( Figure 2 , J and K ) . Apical and basal membrane and nuclear enve - lope were not specifically labeled , but could be retrieved from the data using image processing ( see Materials and Methods ) . Movies of CME dynamics were generally acquired for up to 400 s ( 70 frames ) . Imaging at such high frame rates in 4D brings about unique data - handling and image - processing challenges , with file sizes of ∼ 400 MB / frame / channel and movie sizes reaching ∼ 56 GB . Even drastically cropped versions of movies ( 1 % ) could not be pro - cessed using commercial ( e . g . , Imaris [ Bitplane ] ) or free ( e . g . , TrackMate [ Tinevez et al . , 2017 ] or llsmtools [ Aguet et al . , 2016 ] ) software , as the programs would crash , freeze , or demand major customization . We developed pyLattice , a library of custom image and data analysis tools , to handle the challenge of big data image analysis brought about by high - content 4D imaging technology such as LLSM . In the case of CME , the data analysis task is as follows : input a 4D organoid movie , detect the CME events in that movie , differ - entiate the events according to their origin membrane ( apical , basal , lateral ) , and perform a statistical analysis of the events ( intensity , life - time , etc . ) . Algorithmically , this task can be broken into the following parts ( Figure 3A ) : 1 ) preprocess and input a 4D AO - LLSM movie , 2 ) detect diffraction - limited Cltr and Dnm2 spots in 3D for every frame , 3 ) track detected spots over time , 4 ) match tracks from both channels to each other , and 5 ) process ( filtering , statistical analysis ) and 6 ) visualize the data . PyLattice was designed with the following principles in mind : 1 . Accessibility : as LLSM imaging and other big data imaging tech - niques become more widespread , more researchers will need access to adequate LLSM image analysis solutions . To remove the two most frequently encountered accessibility barriers ( use of a not – widely used programming language and use of expen - sive proprietary software ) , we committed ourselves to using Python ( van Rossum , 1995 ) , one of the most popular program - ming languages , for the library . For 4D visualization , the library interfaces with the free and open - source renderer ChimeraX ( Goddard et al . , 2018 ) . PyLattice itself is open source and freely available under BSD 3 - clause license on github ( https : / / github . com / JohSchoeneberg / pyLattice ) . 2 . Interactivity : scientific image analysis requires the user to sample different parameters ( signal threshold , tracking search radius , gap length , etc . ) and different plotting options to find the best solution for retrieving information from his / her data . PyLattice uses Jupyter notebooks ( Perez and Granger , 2007 ) that contain both input ( Python code ) and output ( computation results , plots ) in an intuitive way that facilitates interactivity and sampling . 2962 | J . Schöneberg et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 3 . Reusability : we aim to reduce redundancy by reusing as much existing code as possible . For detection , tracking , and matching ( tasks 2 – 4 ) , the Matlab package llsmtools ( Aguet et al . , 2016 ) was used as a core , which itself builds on the u - track package ( Jaqaman et al . , 2008 ) . A Matlab wrapper was written around llsmtools to generalize it and form an interface that seamlessly integrates with the Python / Jupyter library ( see Materials and Methods ) . 4 . Generalizability : pyLattice is written to be usable beyond the task at hand ( AO - LLSM imaging of CME ) and should be easily adaptable to any general problem of 4D particle tracking in FIGURE 2 : 4D AO - LLSM imaging of clathrin ( Cltr ) and dynamin2 ( Dnmz ) in intestinal epithelial organoids .

( A ) pyLattice is a library of Python modules , Jupyter notebooks , and Matlab routines that operate together to form an image analysis pipeline . The pipeline steps are as follows ( left to right ) : input of a two - channel 4D AO - LLSM data set ( Cltr magenta , Dnm2 green ) , detection of diffraction - limited puncta , tracking puncta over time , matching each channel’s tracks to one another , processing and filtering the resulting set of tracks , and finally visualizing the data .

FIGURE 4 : Tracking individual clathrin - mediated endocytosis events in 4D . ( A ) Top view of individual CME events ( pseudocolored by lifetime ) tracked in the organoid tissue .

In addition , pyLattice should be extendable to incorporate ad - ditional classes of LLSM image analysis solutions ( e . g . , membrane trafficking ) in the future . PyLattice provides tools for LLSM input data preprocessing ( step 1 ) such as Jupyter notebook data visualization , movie crop - ping , and bleaching correction ( see Supple - mental Figure S1 ) . To ensure accuracy , particle detection , tracking , and matching are each individually interfaced with Jupyter notebooks to allow the user easy access to intermediate results for quality control ( see Supplemental Figure S2 ) . Jupyter note - books for the final analysis step ( step 5 ) enable assignment of CME events to apical , lateral , and basal membrane regions and track classification according to lifetime , as well as various plotting and 4D visualization functionalities ( see Supplemental Figure S2 ) . See Supplemental Table S1 for a list of all Jupyter notebooks provided in pyLattice . The online distribution of pyLattice includes the code as well as installation instructions and a manual . Using pyLattice , CME events were tracked in full 70 - frame movies , resulting in ∼ 10 4 – 3 × 10 4 raw tracks per movie . To distin - guish CME events from other events in the cell , which , for example , involve Cltr alone , only those tracks that showed both a clear Cltr and a clear Dnm2 signal were kept , which represented ∼ 15 – 30 % of the tracks . We note that because our image data in - clude the full volume of the cell , this filtering step eliminated from our analysis non - CME Cltr structures that originated on internal cellular membranes . CME tracks were found throughout the tissue and varied in lifetime ( Figure 4 , A and B ) . Individual tracks showed the characteristic behavior of CME : the ap - pearance of a small fluorescent Cltr spot was followed by an increase in Cltr intensity over tens of seconds until a sharp spike in Dnm2 intensity was recorded that marked the scission of the vesicle ( see Figure 4 , C and D ) . When multiple tracks of the same lifetime cohort ( e . g . , 70 – 105 s , N = 330 ) were gathered and averaged , the pattern of vesicle formation , Dnm2 assembly , scission from the membrane , and uncoating became clearly visible ( Figure 4E ) . AO - LLSM imaging allowed us to track clathrin - coated vesicles after membrane scission occurred . After the Dnm2 spike , our recordings revealed a quick drop in both Dnm2 and Cltr intensity close to back - ground levels , within less than 10 and 40 s , respectively . While the Dnm2 intensity de - creased sharply , the Cltr intensity decrease was more gradual . Using the Dnm2 spike as 2964 | J . Schöneberg et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell a marker for vesicle scission , we determined that about two - thirds of a track’s lifetime is spent in vesicle formation and coat assembly and the remaining third in disassembly and uncoating . To investigate CME on a tissue scale , we tracked all CME events through the full cell layer of four intestinal organoids , comprising ∼ 60 cells per condition ( Figure 5 ) . In two control organoids ( Figure 5 , A and B ) , out of 29 , 474 and 16 , 002 raw tracks , CME events were identi - fied as those showing both Cltr and Dnm2 fluorescence . The result - ing 4484 and 3654 tracks were assigned to their origin membrane surfaces ( 1330 and 1449 basal ; 1138 and 1201 lateral ; 2016 and 1004 apical ) based on each track’s start coordinates ( see Materials and Methods ) . The lifetime distributions for each track class were al - most identical and did not display a difference by origin membrane ( Figure 5 , C and D ) . Tracks were further classified by lifetime cohort , with the first cohort comprising all tracks lasting 0 – 34 s , the second cohort comprising tracks from 34 to 68 s , and so on ( Figure 5 , C and D , insets ) . The largest fraction of tracks ( ∼ 40 – 50 % ) were found to last between 34 and 68 s . The second most prevalent fraction were tracks of the adjacent lifetime cohorts ( 0 – 34 s , ∼ 15 – 20 % ; 68 – 10 s , ∼ 20 – 25 % ) . Only ∼ 8 – 16 % of all tracks lasted longer than 102 s . Inves - tigating the lifetime cohorts with regard to the fluorescence intensity dynamics ( Figure 5 , E – J ) revealed that the overall shape of a CME event is consistent through all lifetime cohorts : an increase in Cltr intensity is followed by a Dnm2 peak , ending with quick intensity decreases of both Cltr and Dnm2 . For each subsequent lifetime cohort , the peak intensity of both Cltr and Dnm2 increased relative to the preceding cohort ( by 22 ± 10 % for Cltr and 81 ± 10 % for Dnm2 ) , indicating that more molecules are recruited to these respec - tive sites . We found that this pattern is remarkably consistent : fluorescence intensities and lifetime dynamics of CME on apical membranes ( Figure 5 , E and F ) very closely matched readouts from lateral ( Figure 5 , G and H ) and basal ( Figure 5 , I and J ) membranes . Molecules that interfere with the actin cytoskeleton are known to change the dynamics of CME and have been reported to act asym - metrically on membranes of polarized cells ( Boulant et al . , 2011 ) . We incubated organoids for 10 min with the actin - stabilizing drug Jasplakinolide ( JASP ) . Imaging and data processing for two inde - pendent Jasplakinolide - treated organoids resulted in 3322 and 2991 tracks ( from 13 , 669 and 10 , 735 raw tracks ) that could be as - signed to their origin membranes ( 1249 and 1171 basal ; 1285 and 1131 lateral ; 788 and 689 apical ; Figure 5 , K and L ) . Lifetime analysis ( Figure 5 , M and N ) revealed that the lifetimes are similar to each other and to the control condition . Cohort populations were similar to the control condition , with the predominant fraction of tracks ( ∼ 50 % ) falling in the 34 – 68 s cohort ( Figure 5 , M and N insets ) . When shapes of the CME dynamics profiles are compared between con - trol and treatment conditions ( Figure 5 , E and F vs . O – T ) , it is nota - ble that the dynamics ( the shapes of the Cltr and Dnm2 recruitment profiles ) behaved almost identically . From results in MDCK cells ( Boulant et al . , 2011 ) , the apical membrane would have been ex - pected to show tracks that were drastically shifted toward longer lifetimes . While we see apparent effects of the JASP treatment , such as fewer total apical tracks ( Figure 5U ) , lower overall Cltr fluores - cence intensity ( Figure 5V ) , and a changed Dnm2 fluorescence in - tensity profile of apical and basal tracks ( Figure 5W ) , Cltr pits with longer lifetimes could not be identified in either the processed tracks or the raw tracks before processing . When the rate of fluores - cence change was investigated between lifetime cohorts ( cohort 1 vs . cohort 4 ) , longer - lifetime cohorts consistently showed increased fluorescence . While this fluorescence increase was consistent among apical , lateral , and basal membranes under the control con - dition ( 33 ± 8 % Cltr , 63 ± 15 % Dnm2 ) , under JASP treatment the increase was strongly dependent on the membrane compartment ( Figure 5X ) . Dnm2 fluorescence increased more on the basal mem - brane ( 102 ± 3 % ) and increased less on the apical membrane ( 52 ± 12 % ) , indicating a possible redistribution of Dnm2 to counteract an asymmetric effect of the drug . In this study , we succeeded in determining CME lifetime distri - butions in two colors for three separate membrane domains of each cell in large volumes containing ∼ 35 cells in intact tissue . To obtain these results , we combined endogenous genome editing in human stem cells , intestinal epithelial organoid formation , AO - LLSM microscopy , and big data image analytics to study CME in cells organized into tissues instead of grown on a surface . Owing to the unique imaging capabilities of the AO - LLSM , we could for the first time simultaneously image both Cltr and Dnm2 dynamics on all three plasma membrane domains ( apical , lateral , and basal ) in 4D in a human polarized epithelium . We developed the novel LLSM image analysis framework pyLattice to analyze the large LLSM data sets and retrieve CME dynamics . How growth of cells in a 3D organoid context would affect CME dynamics relative to what had been observed for cells grown on glass was not known . The lifetime distributions in organoids for clathrin - coated vesicle formation in all three membrane domains , apical , lateral , and basal , is very close to published values for apical and basal membranes in MDCK polarized cells ( Boulant et al . , 2011 ) . In addition , fluorescence intensity dynamics for Cltr and Dnm2 fol - lowed profiles similar to those observed for cells grown on glass : Cltr slowly increases to a plateau in fluorescence intensity . Once a neck has formed , Dnm2 assembles around the neck , resulting in a peak in Dnm2 fluorescence when the vesicle is cut off from its origin membrane . While other techniques such as TIRFM cannot follow newly released vesicles past this scission event , using AO - LLSM we could follow the vesicles further until they were uncoated . Impor - tantly , we observed that the time fractions spent in coat assembly and uncoating were roughly 2 / 3 and 1 / 3 , respectively . We found little to no difference in lifetimes or fluorescence intensity profiles when CME events were classified with respect to origin membrane ( apical , lateral , basal ) . This observation is consistent with findings for adherent polarized MDCK cells ( Boulant et al . , 2011 ) and adherent single nonpolarized cells ( Aguet et al . , 2016 ) . Next , we applied the actin cytoskeleton – stabilizing drug JASP . Similar lifetimes were still observed across all membranes . This ob - servation was somewhat surprising , given reported actin depen - dence of efficient vesicle formation on the different membranes ( Yarar et al . , 2005 ; Boulant et al . , 2011 ; Cheng et al . , 2012 ; Grassart et al . , 2014 ; Dambournet et al . , 2018 ) . Other studies had found that JASP alters CME dynamics , shifting CME events to much longer lifetimes and stalling them ( Grassart et al . , 2014 ) . In adherent MDCK cells , such CME - arresting effects were observed , but notably only for the apical membrane ( Boulant et al . , 2011 ) . Interestingly , tracks originating from the apical membrane showed a marked change in response to JASP : the Dnm2 fluorescence increase for longer tracks was much smaller , while the same increase was much larger for the basal membrane . This observation may reflect a cellular response of recruiting more / fewer Dnm2 molecules to CME sites in an environ - ment of asymmetrically changed actin assembly due to JASP . One possible explanation for the difference between our findings and previous findings in MDCK cells is that our study tracked CME in 3D using two colors of endogenously tagged proteins ( Cltr and Dnm2 ) . In the MDCK study ( Boulant et al . , 2011 ) , the Cltr adaptor protein 2 ( AP2 ) was used as a single marker for endocytosis , potentially dis - playing different dynamics in response to JASP treatment than Cltr and Dnm2 . It is also possible that the different observations are due Volume 29 November 26 , 2018 LLSM , pyLattice reveal CME in organoids | 2965 to the use of different cell types and conditions , but this leaves open the question of whether the JASP fully penetrated the organoids in our studies . The quantitation and analysis of imaging data and Cltr dynamics was made possible by the custom image analysis package pyLat - tice . The advent of high - content big data – imaging modalities such FIGURE 5 : Tissue - scale tracking reveals apical , basal , and lateral membrane dynamics of CME in epithelial intestinal organoids .

Molecular Biology of the Cell as AO - LLSM will make gigabyte movies and terabyte data sets the standard . Automated image analysis provides hope for quantitating such enormous data sets , as manual and semimanual analysis is no longer practical on such scales . pyLattice was conceived with gener - alizability and ease of use in mind so that it could be applied not only to CME but also to all tasks that involve tracking punctate struc - tures in LLSM images . Closer ties between biologists , microscopists , data scientists , and computer scientists will allow the development of additional algorithms that can be incorporated into existing li - braries . We predict that , driven by the scale of the data sets , these tools will create higher demands for computational power and re - sources and will run on dedicated workstations or clusters . This study shows how a confluence of technologies from stem cell biology , 3D organoid culture , advanced microscopy , and big data image analytics can open the door for tissue - scale 4D quantitative cell biology . MATERIALS AND METHODS Genome - engineered intestinal epithelial organoids Cell culture . hESCs ( WIBR3 , NIH stem cell registration 0079 ) were cultured as described ( Soldner et al . , 2009 ; Hockemeyer et al . , 2011 ) . Briefly , hESCs were maintained on a layer of inactivated mouse embryonic fibroblast ( MEFs ) in hESC medium ( DMEM / F12 ( Lifetech ) ) supplemented with 20 % KnockOut Serum Replace ment ( Gibco 10828028 ) , 1 mM glutamine ( Gibco 25030 - 081 ) , 1 % nonessential amino acids ( Gibco 11140076 ) , 0 . 1 mM β - mercaptoethanol ( Sigma - Aldrich M6250 ) , 1000 U / ml penicillin / streptomycin ( Gibco15140122 ) , and 4 ng / ml FGF - Basic full ( Invitrogen PHG0263 ) . Cultures were passaged every 7 d with 1 . 5 mg / ml collagenase type IV ( Gibco 17104019 ) and gravitational sedimentation by washing three times in wash media ( DMEM / F12 [ Gibco 11320 - 033 ] ) supplemented with 5 % fetal bovine serum ( Gibco 10437028 ) and 1000 U / ml penicillin / streptomycin ( Gibco 15140122 ) . Genome editing . The CLTA genes were targeted as previously de - scribed using a paired ZFN that targets exon 7 and cuts precisely at the stop codon ( Doyon et al . , 2011 ; Hong et al . , 2015 ) . Design of donor plasmids and ZFNs was described previously ( Doyon et al . , 2011 ) . The DNM2 gene was targeted in exon 22 using CRISPR / Cas9 and cctgctcgactaggcctcga as single guide RNA ( sgRNA ) target site for Cas9 , and sgRNAs were expressed using the pX330 plasmid ( Addgene plasmid 42230 ; Cong et al . , 2013 ; Ran et al . , 2013 ) . hESCs ( [ 1 – 2 ] × 10 7 ) were electroporated with 5 µg of each ZFN ( or 10 µg of pX330 Cas9 plasmid ) and 40 µg of repair donor plasmid . Cells were sorted for expression of GFP and / or TagRFP fluorescence 72 h after electroporation . Clonal populations were isolated and characterized as described ( Dambournet et al . , 2014 ) . Generation of intestinal epithelial organoids . Intestinal organoids were derived for genome - engineered hESCs as described previ - ously ( Forster et al . , 2014 ) . Briefly , genome - engineered hESCs were injected subcutaneously into NOD - SCID mice ( Taconic ) . Teratomas ( < 2 cm ) formed within 6 – 8 wk were isolated and disaggregated into a single - cell suspension , and ∼ 5 × 10 4 cells were embedded in 50 µl Matrigel ( Corning 354234 ) in a well of a 24 - well plate . Cells were incubated at 37°C for 15 min , and after the Matrigel solidified , growth medium ( see below ) was added to the well . Organoids formed over the period of a week before cultures were passaged by 30 min dissociation in Dispase ( 5 U / ml ; Stemcell Technologies ) and gravity sedimentation of newly forming organoids ( 3 × 2 min at 40 × g in 12 . 5 ml of DMEF12 ( Gibco 11320 - 033 ) with 0 . 5 % bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) ( Sigma ; A4503 ) ) . Single cells were aspirated with the supernatant of each wash to mechanically enrich for the faster - sedimenting organoids . This procedure resulted in almost ho - mogeneous organoid cultures after three passages over three 1 - wk intervals . Subsequent passages were done by mechanical shearing with a P1000 pipette after 5 min exposure to 2 mM EDTA , 0 . 5 % BSA in PBS . Organoid culture medium . Organoids were cultured using condi - tioned medium products as previously described ( Forster et al . , 2014 ) . Low - passage L - WRN cells ( producing Wnt - 3A , R - spondin 1 , and noggin ) were cultured as described previously ( Miyoshi and Stappenbeck , 2013 ; Forster et al . , 2014 ) in DMEM with high glucose ( Sigma ; D6429 ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum , 50 mg / ml G418 ( Gibco 11965 - 092 ) , and 100 mg / ml hygromycin ( Millipore Sigma 400050 ) to confluence and passaged 1 : 4 . When confluent again , 20 ml of new medium per 150 cm 2 flask comprising Advanced DMEM / F12 ( Life Technologies 12634010 ) , 200 mM l - glutamine ( Gibco 25030 - 081 ) , 10 , 000 U / ml penicillin , and 10 mg / ml streptomycin ( Gibco 15140122 ) and 0 . 5 % BSA ( Sigma ; A4503 ) was added and collected each day for 4 d and stored at 4°C before filtration and freezing . This conditioned base medium was supple - mented 1 : 1 with a volume of unconditioned base medium compris - ing Advanced DMEM / F - 12 ( Gibco 12634010 ) , N2 ( Gibco 17502 - 048 ) , B27 ( Gibco 12587 - 010 ) , l - glutamine ( Gibco 25030 - 081 ) , 10 , 000 U / ml penicillin and 10 mg / ml streptomycin ( Gibco 15140122 ) , non - essential amino acids ( Gibco 11140076 ) and stored in frozen ali - quots . Immediately before use , the medium was supplemented with EGF ( 50 ng / ml ; R & D Systems 236 - EG - 01M ) and added into the well containing Matrigel ( Corning 47743 - 716 ) - embedded organoids . Two days before imaging , organoids were released by Dispase ( 5 U / ml ; Stemcell Technologies ) digestion and resuspended in 10 – 20 µl Matrigel without phenol red ( Corning 47743 - 716 ) , placed at 4°C on a 5 mm – diameter coverslip ( Warner Instruments 64 - 0700 ) , and incu - bated at 37°C before medium was added . Medium was replaced with DMEM / F12 without phenol red ( Life Technologies 21041025 ) with 10 mM HEPES ( Gibco 15630080 ) for imaging . Lattice light - sheet imaging with adaptive optics The imaging of the organoids was carried out using the AO - LLSM from the Betzig laboratory at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute Janelia Research Campus ( Ashburn , VA ) . Before data acquisition , sample - induced aberration was measured via direction wavefront sensing though both the excitation and detection objectives . Light from a Ti : Sapphire ultrafast pulsed laser ( Coherent Cameleon Ultra II ) was ported to either the excitation or the detection arm . Two photon – excited fluorescence generated within the specimen by scanning the guide star focused by excitation or detection objective was collected by the same objective , de scanned ( Wang et al . , 2014 ) , and sent to a homebuilt Shack – Hartmann wavefront sensor consist - ing of a square microlens array ( Edmund Optics ) focused onto an electron - multiplying ( EM ) CCD camera ( Andor iXon ) . The light sheet was generated using a square lattice configura - tion in dithered mode ( Chen et al . , 2014 ) with the corrective wave - front applied to the space - light modulator ( Holoeye Pluto BB ) . The 3D objects were imagined by scanning the objective and the dith - ered light sheet at 200 - nm step sizes in the z - axis , thereby captur - ing a volume of ∼ 70 × 60 × 40 µm every 2 . 48 – 2 . 85 s . Each plane of the imaged volume was exposed for 20 – 30 ms and excited using either a 488 - nm laser ( for eGFP ) or a 560 - nm laser ( for TagRFP , both lasers from MPB Lasers ) at 50 – 60 µW with an excitation NA of 0 . 517 / 0 . 55 and a corresponding light - sheet length of 30 µm . The fluorescence signal was first reflected by a deformable mirror Volume 29 November 26 , 2018 LLSM , pyLattice reveal CME in organoids | 2967 ( ALPAO 97 - 15 ) loaded with corrective wavefront and then acquired with a Hamamatsu ORCA - Flash 4 . 0 scientific complementary metal oxide semiconductor ( sCMOS ) camera . pyLattice and data processing pyLattice . pyLattice builds on llsmtools ( Aguet et al . , 2016 ) , a Matlab toolbox that extends u - track ( Jaqaman et al . , 2008 ) , to do tracking in the 3D context of LLSM data sets . The core functionality of llsmtools has been retained and forms the detection and tracking routines of pyLattice . llsmtools’ project - specific routines for single - cell LLSM data ( Aguet et al . , 2016 ) and its input / output functionality has been replaced by a more general Matlab wrapper that also forms the interface to the Python / Jupyter layers of the pyLattice library . The Python / Jupyter layer of the package consists of 25 Python Classes / Jupyter Notebooks that handle 1 ) AO - LLSM data preprocessing such as bleaching correction or data cropping , 2 ) quality control for the detection and tracking pipeline , 3 ) data postprocessing such as track classification by length , intensity , and origin in space , 4 ) project - specific tasks such as label - free membrane identification ( see below ) or the identification of apical , lateral , and basal tracks ( see below ) , and 5 ) result visualization and plotting , such as 3D track visualization or , lifetime cohort plots . See the software distribution on github for a more detailed description , the pyLattice package itself , training data , and usage / installation instructions . Puncta detection and tracking . Experimentally measured point spread functions are used for a wavelet transformation of the lattice data , resulting in a set of 3D candidate coordinates for each frame . Candidate coordinates that lie above background are fitted to a 3D Gaussian model to retrieve position and amplitude for each punc - tum . For tracking , puncta are first linked to each other frame by frame using a cost - matrix approach . This cost matrix is then used in a subsequent step to globally perform track merging , termination , and gap closing operations . For details , see Jaqaman et al . ( 2008 ) and Aguet et al . ( 2016 ) . Track postprocessing . The reporter proteins used for CME , Cltr , and Dnm2 take part in different , non - CME - related processes in the cell . To differentiate CME events from other events , 1000 tracks were manually classified as CME tracks if the tracks showed signifi - cant signal in both the Cltr and Dnm2 channels and if the tracks ended with Dnm2 peaks . From this classified set , an automated classifier was developed that could reproduce the manual classifica - tion with 85 % accuracy when it included all tracks in which the Dnm2 peak intensity was high compared with Cltr peak intensity ( max _ Cltr / max _ Dnm2 < 1 . 5 ) and in which the Dnm2 peak occurred after half of the track’s lifetime ( time ( max _ Dnm2 ) / track _ lifetime > 0 . 5 ) . Throughout the postprocessing , we ensured that all genuine CME tracks were retained and only separated from noise and non - CME tracks . Definition of apical , lateral , and basal tracks . Fluorescence sig - nals of Dnm2 and Cltr originate only from within the epithelial cell layer of the organoid . This 3D fluorescence intensity band is used to calculate a 2D surface ( middle surface ) that resides in the middle of the organoid’s cell layer , in between the apical and basal mem - branes . Depending on the thickness of the organoid’s cell layer , margins are defined that classify every track that originates above the middle surface plus margin as an apical track , every track that originates below the middle surface minus margin as a basal track , and every track in between as a lateral track . Interface to ChimeraX for visualization and quality control . Chi - meraX comes with excellent 4D data - viewing capabilities . For this study , visualization and quality control demanded additional func - tionality , such as 1 ) display of cropped subsets of the AO - LLSM data , 2 ) display of detected puncta , and 3 ) display of detected tracks . For each task , custom functionality has been developed : pyLattice contains Jupyter notebooks that have been designed to process AO - LLSM data sets and pipeline outputs ( such as detection or tracking coordinates ) and to write files that can be imported into ChimeraX for display . Label - free identification of nuclear envelope and organoid apical / basal membrane . The nuclear envelope and the apical and basal membranes of the organoid were not specifically labeled , but their positions could be extracted from information contained in the fluorescence localization data from the labeled proteins ( Cltr , Dnm2 ) . The outside of the organoid , as well as the inside of the nucleus , is free of labeled proteins . The fluorescence intensity of a labeled protein was inverted and subsequently a threshold was applied that traces the rim of the spaces with absent fluorescence . The result is a 3D map of voxels that outline the nuclear envelope as well as both epithelial surfaces ( apical and basal ) of the organoid . As intestinal epithelial organoids are spherical , the curvature of the cell layer allows the identification of the apical membrane ( lumen - facing , negative curvature ) and basal membrane ( outward - facing , positive curvature ) .
