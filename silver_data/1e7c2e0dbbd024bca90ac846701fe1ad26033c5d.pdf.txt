We have previously reported that Rho - kinase accumulates at the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis in several cultured cells . Here , using Rho - kinase inhibitors , Y - 27632 and HA1077 , we found that Rho - kinase is responsible for the phosphorylation of myosin regulatory light chain at Ser 19 in the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis . On the other hand , phosphorylation of ezrin / radixin / moesin ( ERM ) proteins at the cleavage furrow was enhanced by the addition of the above Rho - kinase inhibitors . Treatment with Y - 27632 strongly enhanced the accumulation of Rho - kinase but not RhoA and citron kinase at the cleavage furrow . Furthermore , the furrow ingression in cytokinesis was signiﬁcantly prolonged in the presence of Y - 27632 . These results suggest that Rho - kinase is involved in the progression of cytokinesis through the phosphorylation of several proteins including myosin light chain at the cleavage furrow . Oncogene ( 2000 ) 19 , 6059 – 6064 . Keywords : cell cycle ; cytokinesis ; Rho - kinase ; myosin light chain ; ERM proteins Introduction In animal cells , cytokinesis involves an actomyosin - based contractile ring that forms and constricts at the division plane . Important new information has emerged about spatial and temporal regulation of cytokinesis , such as the function of spindle midzone and the control by GTPase systems ( reviewed in Hales et al . , 1999 ) . The small GTPase Rho is known to play important roles in various cellular functions such as stress ﬁber formation , transcriptional activation , smooth muscle contraction , tumor cell invasion , cell morphology , cell motility and cytokinesis ( reviewed in Takai et al . , 1995 ; Van Aelst and D’Souza - Schorey , 1997 ; Hall , 1998 ) . Rho - kinase / ROK / ROCK is one of targets for Rho and is involved in some of the above cellular functions downstream of Rho ( reviewed in Lim et al . , 1996 ; Narumiya et al . , 1997 ; Kaibuchi et al . , 1999 ) . So far , several actomyosin - associated proteins in - cluding myosin binding subunit of myosin phosphatase ( Kimura et al . , 1996 ) , myosin light chain ( MLC ; Amano et al . , 1996 ) , ezrin / radixin / moesin ( ERM ) proteins ( Matsui et al . , 1998 ; Fukata et al . , 1998 ) and adducin ( Kimura et al . , 1998 ) have been reported as the putative physiological substrates for Rho - kinase . Phosphorylation of ERM proteins at their C - terminal threonine residue ( CP - ERMs ) interferes with their head - to - tail association , leading to the activation as F - actin / plasma membrane cross - linkers ( reviewed in Mangeat et al . , 1999 ) . CP - ERMs concentrate at the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis ( reviewed in Tsukita and Yonemura , 1999 ) . MLC phosphorylation at Ser 19 is believed to promote the contractility of actomyosin in cells ( reviewed in Huttenlocher et al . , 1995 ) . Using site - and phosphorylation state - speciﬁc antibodies , Ser 19 - phosphorylated MLC has been reported to accumulate at the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis ( Matsumura et al . , 1998 ) . We have previously reported that Rho - kinase also accumulates at the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis ( Kosako et al . , 1999 ) . Furthermore , a dominant negative form of Rho - kinase was reported to increase mutinuclei in mammalian cultured cells ( Yasui et al . , 1998 ) . However , the molecular functions of Rho - kinase at the cleavage furrow remain elusive . Here we show that Rho - kinase is responsible for the phosphorylation of myosin light chain at the cleavage furrow by using Rho - kinase inhibitors , Y - 27632 and HA1077 ( Uehata et al . , 1997 ) . Phosphorylation of ERM proteins at the cleavage furrow was not inhibited by these inhibitors . Furthermore , speciﬁc overaccumu - lation of Rho - kinase was observed in the presence of these inhibitors . Ingression of the cleavage furrow was prolonged by the addition of Y - 27632 , suggesting the involvement of Rho - kinase in cytokinesis . Results Disruption of actin stress fibers by Rho - kinase inhibitors Rho - kinase is well known to be involved in the formation of actin stress ﬁbers . To conﬁrm the e(cid:128)ects Oncogene ( 2000 ) 19 , 6059 – 6064 ª 2000 Macmillan Publishers Ltd All rights reserved 0950 – 9232 / 00 $ 15 . 00 www . nature . com / onc * Correspondence : H Kosako , Department of Neurobiology , Graduate School of Medicine , The University of Tokyo , 7 - 3 - 1 Hongo , Bunkyo - ku , Tokyo 113 - 0033 , Japan Received 20 April 2000 ; revised 28 September 2000 ; accepted 3 October 2000 of two types of Rho - kinase inhibitors , Y - 27632 and HA1077 , we added 10 m M Y - 27632 or HA1077 to U251 human glioma cells for 60 min and then stained with rhodamine - phalloidin . As shown in Figure 1 , F - actin stress ﬁbers were dramatically disrupted by both inhibitors , while the e(cid:128)ect of HA1077 seemed to be somewhat weaker than that of Y - 27632 . Inhibition of myosin light chain phosphorylation at the cleavage furrow by Rho - kinase inhibitors We examined the e(cid:128)ects of Rho - kinase inhibitors on the phosphorylation of myosin light chain ( MLC ) at the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis . Y - 27632 was added to U251 cells for 60 min and then stained with a site - and phosphorylation state - speciﬁc antibody for Ser 19 - phosphorylated MLC ( Matsumura et al . , 1998 ) . As shown in Figure 2a , phosphorylation of MLC - Ser 19 at the cleavage furrow was strongly inhibited by Y - 27632 . Similar results were obtained with MDBK bovine epithelial cells and HeLa cells ( Figure 2b ) . HA1077 also inhibited the phosphorylation of MLC - Ser 19 at the cleavage furrow of MDBK cells ( Figure 3 ) . Thus phosphorylation of MLC - Ser 19 at the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis was inhibited by both Rho - kinase inhibitors . Effects of Rho - kinase inhibitors on CP - ERMs at the cleavage furrow We then examined the e(cid:128)ects of Y - 27632 and HA1077 on ERM proteins phosphorylated at their C - terminal threonine residue ( CP - ERMs ) at the cleavage furrow . Y - 27632 or HA1077 was added to U251 cells for 60 min and then stained with a site - and phosphoryla - tion state - speciﬁc antibody for CP - ERMs ( Matsui et al . , 1998 ) . It was surprising that CP - ERMs were increased by both Rho - kinase inhibitors as shown in Figure 4 . Thus Rho - kinase appears not to be responsible for the phosphorylation of ERM proteins at the cleavage furrow . Effects of Rho - kinase inhibitors on the distribution of Rho , citron kinase , mDia and Rho - kinase during cytokinesis RhoA was previously reported to accumulate at the cleavage furrow ( Takaishi et al . , 1995 ) and we conﬁrmed clear accumulation of RhoA at the cleavage furrow by the TCA ﬁxation method ( Hayashi et al . , Figure 1 Disruption of actin stress ﬁbers by Rho - kinase inhibitors . U251 cells were treated with 10 m M Y - 27632 or 10 m M HA1077 for 60 min at 37 8 C and then stained with rhodamine - phalloidin Figure 2 Phosphorylation of myosin regulatory light chain ( MLC ) at Ser 19 in the cleavage furrow was inhibited by Y - 27632 . ( a ) U251 , and ( b ) MDBK and HeLa cells were treated with 0 , 10 or 30 m M Y - 27632 for 60 min and then stained with pp2b ( anti - phosphorylated ML C - Ser 19 antibody ) . Scale bars , 10 m m Involvement of Rho - kinase in cytokinesis H Kosako et al 6060 Oncogene 1999 ; Figure 5 ) . Citron kinase , another Rho e(cid:128)ector ( Madaule et al . , 1998 ) , also accumulated at the cleavage furrow but mDial ( another Rho e(cid:128)ector ; Watanabe et al . , 1997 ) did not accumulate at the cleavage furrow in our experimental conditions . Immunostaining patterns of RhoA , citron kinase and mDial did not change signiﬁcantly by Y - 27632 , although accumulation of RhoA appeared to be enhanced slightly ( Figure 5 ) . In contrast , concentration of Rho - kinase at the cleavage furrow was strongly enhanced by the treatment with Y - 27632 ( Figure 5 ) and HA1077 ( data not shown ) . These results indicate that Rho - kinase speciﬁcally overaccumulates at the cleavage furrow by the Rho - kinase inhibitors . Effects of Y - 27632 on the progression of cytokinesis To examine the e(cid:128)ects of Y - 27632 on the progression of cytokinesis , 30 m M Y - 27632 was added to U251 cells , and then mitotic cells were analysed by time - lapse videomicroscopy . Formation of the cleavage furrow was initiated about 5 or 6 min after the start of chromosome segregation in control or Y - 27632 - treated cells , respectively ( Figure 6a ) . Although furrow ingres - sion apparently ﬁnished within 3 min in control cells , furrow ingression takes about 9 min in Y - 27632 - treated cells ( Figure 6a ) . Time from the start of chromosome segregation to furrow appearance ( anaphase ) pro - longed slightly by Y - 27632 ( Figure 6b ) . In contrast , time from furrow appearance to the stop of ingression ( cytokinesis ) prolonged about threefold by Y - 27632 ( Figure 6b ) . Although each time may not be clear in Figure 6a , we measured each time by observing cells at 10 s intervals . Thus the contractile process during cytokinesis was prolonged signiﬁcantly by the inhibi - tion of Rho - kinase . Discussion In interphase cells , Rho is suggested to regulate MLC phosphorylation through its two e(cid:128)ectors , Rho - kinase and myosin binding subunit of myosin phosphatase ( reviewed in Kaibuchi et al . , 1999 ) . In this study , we showed that Rho - kinase is also implicated in MLC phosphorylation at the cleavage furrow during cytokin - esis . Rho - kinase accumulating at the cleavage furrow might directly phosphorylate MLC and / or phosphor - ylate and inactivate myosin phosphatase in cytokinetic cells . Whether the phosphorylation state of myosin phosphatase in cytokinetic cells is a(cid:128)ected by the Rho - kinase inhibitors is currently under investigation . Inhibition of MLC phosphorylation at the cleavage furrow by the Rho - kinase inhibitors could be inter - preted in several ways including the above possibilities . MLC might be dislocated in other areas , or the actin - myosin complexes might be disassembled at the cleavage furrow . It is necessary to compare precise distributions of Rho and Rho - kinase with those of actin , MLC , MLC kinase , myosin heavy chain and myosin phosphatase at the cleavage furrow in the future work . Rho - kinase can phosphorylate ERM proteins at their C - terminal threonine in vitro ( Matsui et al . , 1998 ; Fukata et al . , 1998 ) . However , Rho - kinase was recently reported not to phosphorylate ERM proteins in vivo ( Matsui et al . , 1999 ) , a result that appears to conﬂict with another report that Rho - kinase can induce moesin phosphorylation in COS - 7 cells ( Oshiro et al . , 1998 ) . Here we showed that phosphorylated ERM proteins were increased at the cleavage furrow by both Rho - kinase inhibitors , suggesting that Rho - kinase does not phosphorylate ERM proteins at the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis . Phosphatidylinositol 4 - phosphate 5 - kinase , another e(cid:128)ector of Rho , might be involved in the ERM phosphorylation at the cleavage furrow as suggested by Matsui et al . ( 1999 ) . We found that Rho - kinase speciﬁcally overaccumu - lated at the cleavage furrow by the Rho - kinase inhibitors , while localization patterns of RhoA , citron kinase and mDial did not change signiﬁcantly . There may exist feedback regulation trying to maintain Rho - kinase activity at the cleavage furrow . Although the molecular mechanism of Rho - kinase overaccumulation in the presence of its inhibitors is unclear , this phenomenon suggests that Rho - kinase plays some roles at the cleavage furrow in cytokinesis . In the present study , ingression of the cleavage furrow was prolonged by Y - 27632 , indicating that Rho - kinase is required for the normal progression of cytokinesis . Although cytokinetic process was pro - longed by Y - 27632 , cytokinesis was completed in the apparent absence of myosin light chain phosphoryla - tion which indicates the lack of the functional actomyosin ring . This may be due to the undetectable low level of myosin light chain phosphorylation . Figure 3 Phosphorylation of MLC at Ser 19 in the cleavage furrow was inhibited by HA1077 . MDBK cells were treated with 0 , 10 or 30 m M HA1077 for 60 min and then stained with pp2b ( green ) . DNAs were stained with propidium iodide ( red ) . Scale bar , 10 m M Oncogene Involvement of Rho - kinase in cytokinesis H Kosako et al 6061 However , this observation is consistent with the recent report that C3 - injected mammalian cultured cells lacking the myosin ring can complete cytokinesis ( O’Connell et al . , 1999 ) . Furthermore , myosin II is not required for cytokinesis in Dictyostelium cells grown on a solid substrate ( reviewed in Gerisch and Weber , 2000 ) . Thus cytokinesis may occur without myosin activation in substrate - anchored cells .
