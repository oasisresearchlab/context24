We expect social networks to change as a result of illness , but social contact data are generally collected from healthy persons . Here we quantified the impact of influenza - like illness on social mixing patterns . We analyzed the contact patterns of persons from England measured when they were symptomatic with influenza - like illness during the 2009 A / H1N1pdm influenza epidemic ( 2009 – 2010 ) and again 2 weeks later when they had recovered . Illness was associated with a reduction in the number of social contacts , particularly in settings outside the home , reduc - ing the reproduction number to about one - quarter of the value it would otherwise have taken . We also observed a change in the age distribution of contacts . By comparing the expected age distribution of cases resulting from trans - mission by ( a ) symptomatic persons with incidence data , we estimated the contribution of both groups to trans - mission . Using this , we calculated the fraction of transmission resulting from ( a ) symptomatic persons , assuming equal duration of infectiousness . We estimated that 66 % of transmission was attributable to persons with sympto - matic disease ( 95 % confidence interval : 0 . 23 , 1 . 00 ) . This has important implications for control : Treating sympto - matic persons with antiviral agents or encouraging home isolation would be expected to have a major impact on transmission , particularly since the reproduction number for this strain was low . behavioral change ; contact networks ; disease transmission ; influenza ; R 0 ratio ; social interaction Abbreviations : ILI , influenza - like illness ; POLYMOD , Improving Public Health Policy in Europe through the Modelling and Economic Evaluation of Interventions for the Control of Infectious Diseases . Knowledge of social networks is vital when seeking to understandandpredictthespreadofinfectiousdiseasesinhumanpopulations . In recent years , concerted efforts have been made to characterize patterns of social mixing within communities using electronic motes ( 1 ) , mobile phones ( 2 ) , or diaries of self - reported contacts ( 3 – 5 ) . As a result , it is now common practice for mathematical models of disease spread to incor - porate mixing data to describe interactions between different population subgroups ( 6 – 12 ) . However , at present , most models assumethatcontactpatternsremainconstantovertime . Inreal - ity , it is clear that patterns of contact are changeable . Forexam - ple , social behavior differs between weekdays and weekends ( 6 ) and between school terms and holiday periods ( 6 – 9 , 13 ) . These regular temporal variations in contact patterns can be appropriately included in epidemiologic models , given the increasing availability of data describing them . However , there remains a critical gap in our current knowledge — namely , the impact of illness on social contact patterns . If , as might be expected , people modify their behavior when they are ill , the value to mathematical models of social mixing data collected predominantly from healthy persons is questionable . If illness results in people ’ s taking time off from work or school , avoiding social gatherings , or changing their social behavior in other ways , the behavior of ill persons would be poorly described by commonly collected social contact data . If asymptomatic infections are common or if transmission takes place before symptoms appear , then possible changes in social behavior are less important . During the 2009 in ﬂ uenza pandemic , we asked persons from England to record their social contacts when they were symptomatic with in ﬂ uenza - like illness ( ILI ) , and again 2 weeks later after they had recovered ( 9 ) . We analyzed these 1655 Am J Epidemiol . 2013 ; 178 ( 11 ) : 1655 – 1662 AmericanJournalof Epidemiology ©TheAuthor2013 .

We show that this has a major impact on the basic reproduction number ( R 0 ) ( 14 ) and the expected age distribution of cases in the popula - tion . It is suspected that the 2009 A / H1N1pdm epidemic resulted in a large number of infections that displayed no symp - toms or mild symptoms . Both serological data and modeling work indicated that patients with ILI who sought medical attention were a small fraction of the total number of persons with infections in the United Kingdom ( 13 , 15 ) . By compar - ing the observed age distribution of cases with that predicted by the measured contact patterns of asymptomatic and symp - tomaticpersons , wewereabletoaddressoneofthemoreintrac - table problems of in ﬂ uenza epidemiology : What contribution do asymptomatic persons make to overall in ﬂ uenza transmis - sion ? The ﬁ ndings have important implications for public health , since the proportion of transmission resulting from sympto - matic persons determines how effective treatment with anti - viral agents or home isolation will be in limiting spread of the disease . MATERIALS AND METHODS Contact surveys Socialcontactsweremeasuredusingself - completedcontact diaries closely based on those developed in the POLYMOD ( Improving Public Health Policy in Europe through the Modelling and Economic Evaluation of Interventions for the Control of Infectious Diseases ) Study , a large - scale population - based study carried out in several European countries ( 3 ) . The current survey was carried out during the A / H1N1pdm in ﬂ u - enza epidemic in England in the autumn and winter of 2009 – 2010 and is described in detail elsewhere ( 9 ) . In brief , during theepidemic , participantswererecruitedintothestudythrough questionnaire packs distributed with antiviral medication at 31 antiviral distribution centers throughout England . Partici - pants were asked to complete the questionnaire while they were symptomatic with ILI . For children below 16 years of age , either the children could ﬁ ll in the diary by themselves or a parent / guardian could ﬁ ll it in on their behalf . The question - naire consisted of 2 parts : ﬁ rst , a background survey asking questions about demographic factors ( such as age and gender ) and the participant ’ s illness ( such as onset date and severity ) ; and second , a social contact diary in which participants were asked to record details about each person they met during the course of a day : the gender and ( estimated ) age of the con - tact , the social setting and duration of the encounter , the fre - quency with which that person was met , and whether the encounter involved any skin - to - skin contact ( e . g . , a hand - shake , a kiss , or contact sports ) . Participants were asked to return the questionnaire in a prepaid envelope and to supply their address . Two weeks later ( by which time participants were expected to have recovered from their illness ) , partici - pants were sent a similar , follow - up questionnaire , again including a social contact diary . Thus , during the survey we aimed to obtain 2 contact diaries from each participant : one completed when the participant was symptomatic and one completed after he or she had recovered . We will refer to persons with symptoms of ILI as “ ill ” or “ symptomatic ” and to persons without symptoms of ILI as “ healthy ” or “ asymptomatic . ” A total of 301 participants returned a contact diary with their ﬁ rst questionnaire . A total of 174 participants returned a contact diary with their second questionnaire . One participant did not report his / her age and was excluded from analyses . Not all participants were ill when they completed the ﬁ rst ques - tionnaire , and not all had recovered by the time they com - pleted their second questionnaire . A total of 140 participants returned 2 contact diaries , one completed when they were ill and one completed when they were healthy ; these 280 contact diaries made up the paired sample . A total of 283 partici - pants were ill when they completed their ﬁ rst contact diary ; these 283 contact diaries completed when participants were ill made up the ill sample . A total of 159 participants were either recovered when they completed their second contact diary ( n = 151 ) or were not ill when they completed their ﬁ rst con - tact diary and did not complete a second contact diary ( n = 8 ) ; these 159 contact diaries , completed when participants were healthy , made up the healthy sample . A summary of the par - ticipants ’ demographic information can be found in Web Table 1 ( available at http : / / aje . oxfordjournals . org / ) . Analyses We compared social mixing patterns reported by ill partici - pants with those reported by healthy participants , investigating both the number of contacts and the distribution of contacts between age groups . Age categorization for children and young adults was based on the United Kingdom schooling system ; for the adults , 3 age classes were chosen to allow for likely family , household , and workplace arrangements at dif - ferent ages . The resulting age classes were ≤ 3 , 4 – 10 , 11 – 21 , 22 – 45 , 46 – 64 , and ≥ 65 years . We made several compari - sons : First , we used the paired contact diaries to assess the impact of ILI symptoms on social mixing behavior at the individual level ; and second , we compared unpaired contact diaries ( completed by ill or healthy participants ) with the POLYMOD data from Great Britain as a historical control . The contact diaries used in this study had space for encounters with 33 different people to be recorded . Ten participants also reported additional encounters . In the results presented here , we capped the number of encounters at 33 . Sensitivity ana - lyses showed no strong deviations when all reported contacts were used . Thecontactdiariesusedinthisstudygiveanumberofdifferent ways of de ﬁ ning an epidemiologically meaningful encoun - ter . Here , in common with previous studies ( 16 , 17 ) , we focused on 2 possibilities : First , we analyzed all encounters recorded in the diary ; and second , we analyzed only those encounters that included physical ( skin - to - skin ) contact ( see Web Table 2 and Web Figures 1 and 2 ) . Estimating transmission rates Adapting the methodology of Wallinga et al . ( 18 ) and Goeyvaerts et al . ( 16 ) , we estimate the social contact matrix M , with elements m ij representing the mean number of 1656 Van Kerckhove et al . Am J Epidemiol . 2013 ; 178 ( 11 ) : 1655 – 1662 a t B i b li o t h ee k L U C - VO W L on J a nu a r y 10 , 2014 h tt p : / / a j e . ox f o r d j ou r n a l s . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m contacts with people in age class j during 1 day reported by a respondent in age class i : ^ m ij ¼ P T i t ¼ 1 w dt y ijt P T i t ¼ 1 w dt ; where y ijt is the reported number of contacts made by partici - pant t in age class i with people in age class j , T i is the number of participants in age class i , and w dt is a diary weight for partici - pant t . To be able to compare the current results with those of other studies , such as POLYMOD , the age of the partici - pant and the day on which the contacts were recorded are used in the weighting . Hence , these weights account for different sampling probabilities in different age groups and on differ - ent days of the week and consequently yield estimates of population - based contact matrices ( further information is available in Web Appendix 1 ) . We also consider the next - generation matrix G with ele - ments g ij representing the average number of secondary infec - tions in age class i resulting from the introduction of a single infectious individual of age class j into a population ( 14 ) . This next - generation matrix describes how infection is passed within and between age classes and is de ﬁ ned as g ij = m ji s i Dq , where s i is the fraction of group i that is susceptible to infection , D is the average duration of infectiousness , and q is the disease - speci ﬁ c ( proportionality ) factor ( 16 – 18 ) . Since people ’ s mixing patterns when ill ( symptomatic ) are different from those pres - ent when they are healthy ( asymptomatic ) , we can calculate matrices M S and G S basedonbehaviorwhensymptomaticand matrices M A and G A based on behavior when asymptomatic . Comparing contact matrices While it is possible to display contact patterns graphically using the social contact matrix M , it is not immediately clear how best to quantify epidemiologically relevant differences between contact matrices . Here we compare contact patterns using the basic repro - duction number , R 0 , de ﬁ ned as the dominant eigenvalue of the next - generation matrix G when the entire population is susceptible ( i . e . , s i = 1 ) ( 14 ) . Following the method of Hens et al . ( 6 ) , we consider the ratio of estimates of R 0 derived from different mixing matrices G S and G A , which is equiva - lent to comparing the dominant eigenvalues of M S and M A . Under the null hypothesis of equal contact matrices and assuming q to be constant , this ratio is expected to equal 1 . For each comparison , we assess the signi ﬁ cance of any deviation from the null hypothesis by calculating 95 % con ﬁ - dence intervals based on a paired nonparametric bootstrap ( 19 ) ( see Web Appendix 2 ) . We also calculate the expected age distribution of incidence in the population during the exponential phase , as given by the leading eigenvector of the next - generation matrix ( 14 , 20 ) . Contribution of symptomatic cases to influenza transmission We seek to estimate the proportion of cases generated by asymptomatic individuals , η . To do this , we assume that a proportion φ of infectious individuals are asymptomatic ( i . e . , have mixing patterns described by M A ) , with the remaining proportion ( 1 − φ ) being symptomatic ( i . e . , having mixing patterns described by M S ) . We assume φ to be the same for all age groups . To obtain an estimate for φ , we consider v mixed , the leading eigenvector of the adapted next - generation operator G mixed = φ q A G A + ( 1 − φ ) q S G S . Here , q A and q S represent the transmissibility for asymptomatic and sympto - matic persons , respectively . Multiplying G mixed by a con - stant does not change the ( normalized ) eigenvector ; hence , v mixed is also the leading eigenvector of G mixed ϕ q A ¼ G A þ 1 (cid:2) ϕ ϕ (cid:2) (cid:3) q R G S ; where q R ¼ð q S = q A Þ ∈ ð 0 ; ∞ Þ . We de ﬁ ne ~ ϕ ¼½ð 1 (cid:2) ϕ Þ = ϕ (cid:3) q R ∈ ½ 0 ; ∞ Þ , from which φ can be deduced if q R is known . The sus - ceptibility of the population ( s i ) in the calculation of G A and G S is obtained from a serological study conducted using sam - ples from England taken during the year prior to the pandemic ( 21 ) . The predicted distribution of incidence across age groups using G mixed is compared with general practitioners ’ consulta - tion data from England and Wales from the early part of the epidemic ( weeks 23 – 28 in 2009 ) ( 22 ) . During this part of the epidemic , the number of cases was growing approximately exponentially ; hence , the expected distribution of incidence is given by v mixed , the leading eigenvector of G mixed . This analysis uses slightly different age groups ( ≤ 4 , 5 – 14 , 15 – 44 , 45 – 64 , and ≥ 65 years ) to match those in the general practi - tioners ’ data . The optimal value of ~ ϕ is estimated as the value leading to the smallest least - squares difference between the observed and estimated age distributions of cases , using all contacts , physical contacts , or contacts of a duration longer than 1 hour ( these last 2 categories being included for consid - eration because more intimate and longer - duration contacts have previously been shown to be closely related to trans - mission patterns ( 16 , 17 , 23 ) ) . We note that the best - ﬁ tting value of ~ ϕ is independent of the value of q R . The proportion of infections generated by asymptomatic persons is given by η ¼ P G A v mixed P G A v mixed þ ~ ϕ P G S v mixed : The estimate of η is independent of q R ; that is , the fraction of infections caused by asymptomatic persons is independent of the relative transmissibility in symptomatic and asymp - tomatic persons . Having calculated the best - ﬁ tting value for ~ ϕ , then if we are able to independently measure φ we can cal - culate q R and vice versa . Further methodological details , including the notation used and details on the weighting process , construction of con ﬁ dence intervals , and additional analyses , can be found in Web Appendices 1 – 4 . RESULTS The general information we used , such as symptoms , sever - ity of illness , and a preliminary analysis of the number of Impact of Illness on Social Networks 1657 Am J Epidemiol . 2013 ; 178 ( 11 ) : 1655 – 1662 a t B i b li o t h ee k L U C - VO W L on J a nu a r y 10 , 2014 h tt p : / / a j e . ox f o r d j ou r n a l s . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m contacts ( but not the age distribution of contacts ) , had been presented previously ( 9 ) . It was observed that when healthy , people reported an average of 14 . 9 ( 95 % con ﬁ dence interval : 11 . 2 , 20 . 1 ) contacts each day and , when ill , they reported 3 . 8 ( 95 % con ﬁ dence interval : 3 . 2 , 4 . 6 ) contacts daily . Here , we observed that ill people altered whom they con - tacted ( Figure 1 ) . As expected , a large proportion of encoun - ters reported by participants when they were healthy were with people of a similar age as themselves , with particularly high numbers of contacts occurring among schoolchildren and young adults . Indeed , the contact patterns of participants when healthy were very similar to those observed in the POLYMOD Study ( see Web Table 2 and Web Figures 1 and 2 ) . In contrast , the strong like - with - like pattern of social mixing was not evident in encounters reported when participants were unwell . We note that the contact patterns displayed in Figure 1 may be asymmetric , since , for example , people contacted by ill participants may have been either ill or healthy . That illness results in a particular reduction in the number of contacts between people of similar ages can be understood when considering the social setting of encounters ( Figure 2 , Table 1 ; also see Web Appendix 3 ) ( 24 ) . When ill , participants reported having far fewer contacts in the work / school and lei - sure settings — both settings where like - with - like mixing between age groups wouldbe expected to take place . In contrast , illness has little discernible effect on the number of contacts made at home . Although it is tempting to assume that home con - tacts provide an appropriate proxy for contacts made when ill , we did not ﬁ nd this to be the case : Comparing the reported contacts made at home with the reported contacts made during illness , we found an R 0 ratio signi ﬁ cantly different from 1 ( R 0 ratio = 1 . 42 , 95 % con ﬁ dence interval : 1 . 01 , 2 . 53 ) . Turning to the duration of encounters , we see in Figure 2 that in most set - tings there was a tendency for participants to report briefer encounters when they were ill . The altered patterns of social encounters when people are symptomatic result in large reductions in the basic reproduc - tion number , R 0 . When calculated using the symptomatic con - tact matrix , R 0 is only one - quarter of the value it takes when calculated using the asymptomatic contact matrix ( Table 2 ) . These changes also affect the expected distribution of infec - tion during the early stages of an outbreak . As Figure 3 shows , the contact patterns of healthy participants would result in a concentration of incidence among children of primary - school age . However , the contact patterns of ill participants resulted in a greater concentration of incidence in young adults . This effect emerged because children reported far fewer contacts with other children when symptomatic . Because like - with - like mixing was less evident in ill persons , mixing among adults and between adults and children played a greater role in trans - mission . Under the assumption that persons with an asymptomatic infection do not change their social contact behavior , we can use our data to estimate the fraction of cases infected by asymptomatic persons , by comparing the age distribution of incidence from general practitioners ’ consultation data ( points in Figure 4 ( both panels ) ) with that predicted using the ill and healthy contact data ( lines in Figure 4 ( right panel ) ) . The left panel of Figure 4 shows this estimation method for different φ values ( assuming q R = 1 ) : If φ = 0 , then only symptomatic persons transmit infection , and the age distribution of cases during the exponential phase of the epidemic would be given 0 20 40 60 80 100 0 20 40 60 80 100 Participant Age , years C on t ac t A g e , y ea r s 0 20 40 60 80 100 0 20 40 60 80 100 Participant Age , years C on t ac t A g e , y ea r s 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 Figure 1 .

If φ = 1 , then only asymptomatic persons transmit infection , and the age distribution of cases would be given by the dashed line . We ﬁ nd ( see Figure 4 ( right panel ) and Table 3 ) that the observed distribution of ILI cases during the early stage of the epidemic is consistent with the majority of transmission ’ s being due to persons with overt symptoms of ILI ; we found that approximately two - thirds of the infections ( Table 3 , “ all contacts ” ) were caused bysymptomatic persons . The best ﬁ t to the data was found when using patterns of mixing derived from all reported contacts ; restricting encounters to those involving some physical contact or those lasting lon - ger than an hour resulted in a poorer ﬁ t to the incidence data ( Table 3 ) . Using the contact matrices describing all contacts , the best - ﬁ tting value for ~ ϕ was 5 . 86 . It has been suggested that approxi - mately two - thirds of infections involved any symptoms of ILI ( 25 ) , which leads to q R ≈ 2 . 93 , implying that persons with symptomatic infections are about 3 times as infectious per social contact as persons with asymptomatic infections . If it were the case that one - third of infections were sympto - matic ( e . g . , considering only infection that causes fever ( 25 ) ) , then q R would be estimated to be 11 . 72 . If half of the infections were symptomatic , then q R would be estimated to be 5 . 86 . DISCUSSION We have quanti ﬁ ed the marked effect that being infected with ILI has on people ’ s social mixing behavior . People report signi ﬁ cantly fewer social encounters when they have in ﬂ uenza symptoms . Not only does the number of encoun - ters fall , but the patterns of contact change ; people with ILI have fewer contacts at work / school and during leisure activi - ties , which results in fewer contacts in their own age group . This can be understood as a result of people taking time off from work / school and avoiding social activities when ill . We have found that patterns of incidence during the early stages of the in ﬂ uenza A / H1N1pdm pandemic in England and Wales suggest that symptomatic persons generated the majority of cases . Therefore , there is scope to focus interven - tion resources on targeting symptomatic persons , encourag - ing ef ﬁ cient treatment , and recommending time off from 0 20 40 60 80 100 Home Travel Leisure Other Work 0 . 04 0 . 73 1 . 39 2 . 61 5 . 5 A v e r a g e N o . o f C on t ac t s D u r a ti on o f C on t ac t s , % Location of Contacts > 4 hours 1 – 4 hours 10 minutes− 1 hour 5 – 10 minutes < 5 minutes NA Figure 2 .

It appears that during the A / H1N1pdm epidemic , symptomatic persons were , in general , suf ﬁ ciently unwell that they mod - erated their social behavior ; had a substantial fraction of them continued to engage in normal social activities , there would have been a large increase in transmission .

Changes in behavior , in our sample , were correlated with severity of illness ( measured by number of symptoms reported ) ( 9 ) . However , the presence of symptoms is also correlated with higher transmissibility : If , as seems plausible , between one - third and two - thirds of A / H1N1pdm infections were symptomatic ( 25 ) , then our calculations suggest that symptomatic infections were 3 – 12 times as infectious as asymptomatic infections . Therefore , there appears to be a trade - off between infectiousness and opportunities for trans - mission . Symptomatic persons are more infectious percontact but make fewer contacts than asymptomatic persons . Accessing symptomatic persons is challenging and , as with any such study , it is possible that the participants in this study were not representative of all people with ILI . However , the fact that patterns of incidence during the early stages of the epi - demic were so well predicted by the mixing patterns reported by participants suggests that we succeeded in capturing true epidemiologicallyrelevantbehavior . Furthermore , whenhealthy , the participants had mixing patterns very similar to those found in other social - contact studies , suggesting that the sam - ple was reasonably representative in terms of normal social mixing behavior . We note that the social - contact data used here were collected only in England , while data from other sources have covered all of Great Britain or England and Wales ; how - ever , in all cases , the majority of the information came from England , so we are con ﬁ dent that the differences in sampling locations did not affect our conclusions . The potential limitations of the diary - based approach are well known ( 27 ) . Collecting data from young children is dif - ﬁ cult , since proxies have to be used and people ( of any age ) may not record all of their contacts . Electronic methods ( 1 ) can reduce these problems , but such methods require very high rates of participation in order to record most contacts ( 27 ) and are therefore not suitable for a general population survey . Differ - ent biases could appear when participants are unwell , which could have affected our results . For example , diaries could be ﬁ lled in better when people are ill , since fewer contacts are easier to remember and record , or they could be ﬁ lled in less well , since illness may make participation more burdensome . We were unable to quantify the magnitude of such effects . In this analysis , the duration of infectiousness was assumed to be equal for symptomatic and asymptomatic persons . The in ﬂ uences of this assumption have not yet been investigated , since they were beyond the scope of this initial paper , but will bethefocusoffurtherwork . Weassumedthatinfectedpersons are behaviorally “ asymptomatic ” or “ symptomatic ” through - out their infectious period . Alternatively , it is possible that people with symptoms change their social mixing behavior some time after symptom onset or that people are infectious for some time before symptoms appear . Exploring the impact of these possibilities will be the focus of ongoing work ; in the models presented here , in the absence of good data with which to link infectiousness , symptom onset , and behavior change , we have taken the simpler approach . To our knowledge , this study was the ﬁ rst to assess the individual - level impact of infection on social contact patterns and the consequences of altered social encounters on epi - demic transmission . Even though the 2009 pandemic in ﬂ u - enza strain was relatively mild , the change in contact patterns induced was large and epidemiologically signi ﬁ cant . Epi - demic models that fail to take these changes into account are likely to be inaccurate — even more so if disease severity is high . Symptomatic persons appear to have been responsible for most of the infection transmission , and efforts to reduce in ﬂ uenzatransmission should target them . Indeed , should this result hold for other strains of in ﬂ uenza , identifying , treating , and isolating symptomatic individuals should be the focus of public health efforts in order to prevent transmission to others in the community .
