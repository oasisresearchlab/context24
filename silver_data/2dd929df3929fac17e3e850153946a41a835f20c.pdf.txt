Here , we report that a leucine - rich repeat - containing protein , LRRC23 , is an RS3 head 39 component essential for its head assembly and flagellar motility in mammalian spermatozoa . 40 From infertile male patients with defective sperm motility , we identified a splice site variant of 41 LRRC23 . A mutant mouse model mimicking this variant produces a truncated LRRC23 at the C - 42 terminus that fails to localize to the sperm tail , causing male infertility due to defective sperm 43 motility . LRRC23 was previously proposed to be an ortholog of the RS stalk protein RSP15 . 44 However , we found that purified recombinant LRRC23 interacts with an RS head protein RSPH9 , 45 which is abolished by the C - terminal truncation . Evolutionary and structural comparison also 46 shows that LRRC34 , not LRRC23 , is the RSP15 ortholog . Cryo - electron tomography clearly 47 revealed that the absence of the RS3 head and the sperm - specific RS2 - RS3 bridge structure in 48 LRRC23 mutant spermatozoa . Our study provides new insights into the structure and function of 49 RS3 in mammalian spermatozoa and the molecular pathogenicity of LRRC23 underlying reduced 50 sperm motility in infertile human males . 51 52 3 Introduction 53 54 Motile cilia and flagella are evolutionarily conserved organelles essential for cellular motility 55 ( Inaba , 2011 ; Ishikawa , 2017 ) . The core of motile cilia and flagella is the ‘9 + 2’ axoneme , 56 characterized by a scaffold structure composed of nine peripheral microtubule doublets ( MTDs ) 57 and a central pair of singlet microtubules ( CP ) . Each MTD binds two rows of dyneins , the outer - 58 arm dyneins ( OAD ) and inner - arm dyneins ( IAD ) , which generate mechanical force required for 59 the ciliary beating via ATP hydrolysis ( Kubo et al , 2021 ; Rao et al , 2021 ) . Radial spoke ( RS ) 60 controls the amplitude of the ciliary and flagellar beat by transmitting mechanochemical signals 61 from the CP to the axonemal dyneins ( Smith & Yang , 2004 ; Viswanadha et al , 2017 ) . In 62 Chlamydomonas reinhardtii , RS mutations paralyze the flagellar movement ( Witman et al , 1978 ) 63 and the axoneme lacking RS system shows reduced velocity of microtubule sliding by dyneins 64 ( Smith & Sale , 1992 ) . In human and mouse , mutations in RS components or their absence cause 65 primary ciliary dyskinesia ( PCD ) and / or male infertility due to the defective ciliary and flagellar 66 beating ( Abbasi et al , 2018 ; Liu et al , 2021 ; Sironen et al , 2020 ) . These studies highlight the 67 physiological importance of RS in regulating ciliary and flagellar movement . 68 69 A triplet of three RSs ( RS1 , RS2 , and RS3 ) repeats every 96 - nm along the peripheral MTDs and 70 this 96 - nm periodicity of RS is well - conserved in cilia and flagella across diverse organisms 71 ( Viswanadha et al . , 2017 ; Zhu et al , 2017 ) . RS is a multiprotein complex ; at least 23 RS 72 components were identified in C . reinhardtii ( Gui et al , 2021 ; Viswanadha et al . , 2017 ; Yang et al , 73 2006 ) . These RS components are also crucial for RS organization and function in other ciliated 74 and flagellated organisms ( Bazan et al , 2021 ; Ralston et al , 2006 ; Sironen et al . , 2020 ; Urbanska 75 et al , 2015 ) , indicating evolutionarily conserved molecular composition of the RS . However , cryo - 76 electron microscopy ( cryo - EM ) studies have revealed species - and tissue - specific structural 77 variabilities in RS3 . For example , RS3 in most species is a T - shaped axonemal structure that 78 consists of a head and a stalk like those of RS1 and RS2 ( Imhof et al , 2019 ; Leung et al , 2021 ; 79 Lin et al , 2014 ; Pigino et al , 2011 ) but RS3 in C . reinhardtii is a headless and stump - like structure 80 ( Pigino et al . , 2011 ) . In addition , mammalian sperm flagellar axoneme carries a unique bridge 81 structure between RS2 and RS3 ( Leung et al . , 2021 ) , which is not observed from tracheal cilia as 82 well as other flagellated organisms ( Imhof et al . , 2019 ; Lin et al . , 2014 ) . This variability suggests 83 that RS3 is an evolutionarily more divergent structure and conveys species - and / or tissue - specific 84 ciliary and flagellar function . Yet , the overall molecular composition of RS3 and the extent to 85 which RS3 components are species - and / or tissue specific remains largely unknown . 86 87 Asthenozoospermia ( ASZ ) is the male infertility classified by reduced sperm motility ( World 88 Health Organization , 2010 ) . ~ 80 % of male infertile patients manifest sperm motility defects ( Curi 89 et al , 2003 ) as infertile male with abnormal sperm morphology and / or reduced sperm count often 90 accompany low motility ( Cavarocchi et al , 2022 ; Toure et al , 2021 ) . Recent whole exome 91 sequencing studies identified genetic defects in RS components from idiopathic ASZ patients ( Liu 92 et al . , 2021 ; Martinez et al , 2020 ; Shen et al , 2021 ) . Mutant analyses using model organisms 93 further elucidated the function of RS components in the flagellar movement and the pathogenic 94 mechanisms ( Liu et al . , 2021 ; Martinez et al . , 2020 ) . Thus , WES combined with functional and 95 structural analyses of mutants , especially in a mouse model , would be a powerful and direct 96 approach to understand mammalian specific RS3 roles including sperm motility regulation and 97 genetic etiologies causing male infertility . 98 99 Here , we report a bi - allelic loss - of - function splicing variant in LRRC23 from ASZ patients in a 100 Pakistani consanguineous family . We generated a mouse model that mimics the human mutation 101 and found that the mutation leads to C - terminal truncated LRRC23 and that the mutant mice 102 4 phenocopy the impaired sperm motility and male infertility . Using biochemical analyses and 103 structural prediction , we showed that , different from previously known , LRRC23 is not the 104 ortholog of a RS2 stalk protein RSP15 but interacts with a known RS head protein . Finally , we 105 visualized the in - cell structures of RS triplets in intact WT and mutant sperm using cryo - electron 106 tomography ( cryo - ET ) . We observed missing RS3 head and aberrant junction between RS2 and 107 RS3 in the mutant flagellar axoneme , unarguably demonstrating that LRRC23 is a head 108 component of RS3 . This study provides molecular pathogenicity of LRRC23 in RS - associated 109 ASZ and reveals unprecedented structural insights into the RS3 and its implication in normal 110 sperm motility and male fertility in mammals . 111 112 113 5 Results 114 115 A Loss of Function Splice Site Variant Truncating LRRC23 is Identified from a 116 Consanguineous Family with Asthenozoospermia 117 A consanguineous Pakistani family with infertile males was recruited ( Fig 1 A ) . Both infertile 118 males ( IV - 1 and IV - 2 ) have failed to have child over 3 years of unprotected sex after marriage 119 ( Table EV1 ) . The male infertile patients do not show PCD - related symptoms , abnormal heights , 120 weights , secondary characteristics , nor anatomical defects . They also have normal karyotypes 121 without Y chromosome microdeletion . Overall , the Papanicolaou ( PAP ) stained spermatozoa from 122 the infertile patients showed an overall normal morphology ( Figs 1B and EV1A ) , which was 123 further supported by normal ranges of abnormal sperm morphology assessed by clinical semen 124 analysis ( Table EV1 ) . However , their progressive motility was lower than the World Health 125 Organization ( WHO ) standard ( World Health Organization , 2010 ) and the patients were clinically 126 diagnosed as ASZ ( Table EV1 ) . To understand the genetic etiology underlying the defective 127 sperm motility , we performed whole exome sequencing ( WES ) on the proband , IV - 1 . WES 128 estimated 5 . 02 % inbreeding co - efficiency and the longest homozygous - by - descent segment as 129 37 . 5 cM , verifying the consanguineous nature of the recruited family . Among the four identified 130 rare variants ( Table EV2 ) , only one homozygous splicing donor site variant ( c . 621 + 1G > A ) in 131 LRRC23 ( leucin - rich repeat containing protein 23 ) is co - segregated with the male infertility 132 phenotype ( Fig 1A , C , and D ) . Of note , a female sibling ( IV - 4 ) who also has the homozygous 133 LRRC23 variant ( IV - 4 ) is infertile because her partner was able to have children from his second 134 marriage ( Fig 1A ) . However , the infertility of IV - 4 is not likely be due to the variant because the 135 mother ( III - 1 ) also carries the homozygous allele but was fertile ( Fig 1A ) . The variant at the 136 splicing donor site of LRRC23 intron 5 is predicted to prevent splicing out of the intron , which can 137 lead to early termination of protein translation with loss of 136 amino acids at the C - terminus ( Fig 138 EV1B and C ) . To verify the splicing defects and generation of mutant protein by the variant , we 139 constructed minigenes to express LRRC23 ORF spanning partial intron 5 with the normal or 140 variant sequence at the splicing site in 293T cells ( Fig 1E ) . 293T cells transfected with the 141 construct carrying the variant failed to splice out the intronic region ( Fig 1F ) and generated only 142 truncated LRRC23 ( Fig EV1D ) . These results suggest the variant is pathogenic and explains the 143 male infertility with defective sperm motility in this family . 144 145 C - terminally Truncated LRRC23 Fails to Localize in the Flagella and Causes Defective 146 Sperm Motility 147 LRRC23 is a radial spoke ( RS ) component ( Padma et al , 2003 ) . Consistent with the ASZ 148 phenotype in our infertile patients with a new splice mutation in LRRC23 , genetic ablation of 149 Lrrc23 in mice causes severe sperm motility defects and male infertility ( Zhang et al , 2021 ) . 150 However , how the C - terminus truncation of LRRC23 affects the RS structure and function 151 remains unresolved . To better understand detailed function of LRRC23 and the molecular 152 pathogenicity of the identified variant , we generated Lrrc23 mutant mice by CRISPR / Cas9 153 genome editing to mimic the predicted outcome in human patients ( Figs EV1 and EV2A ) . We 154 targeted two regions , one in intron 5 and the other in intron 7 ( Fig EV2B ) to delete exon 6 and 7 155 together and express truncated LRRC23 at C - terminus . We established two mouse lines with 156 4 , 126 or 4 , 135 bp deletion ( Lrrc23 - 4126del and Lrrc23 - 4135del , respectively ) ( Fig EV2C ) . Both 157 homozygous Lrrc23 - 4126del and 4135del mice displayed the identical male infertility and 158 defective sperm motility phenotypes in our initial characterization . In this study , we used Lrrc23 - 159 4126del line as Lrrc23 - mutant line unless indicated . We observed that truncated Lrrc23 mRNA is 160 expressed from the mutant Lrrc23 allele but the total mRNA level of Lrrc23 in testis is not different 161 from wildtype ( WT ) to that in Lrrc23 Δ / Δ males ( Fig EV2D - F ) . Sequencing the truncated Lrrc23 162 mRNA revealed that the transcript would produce mutant LRRC23 containing 27 non - native 163 6 amino acids translated from 3’ UTR instead of 136 amino acids at the C - terminus ( Fig EV2G ) . 164 Despite the comparable Lrrc23 mRNA levels in WT and Lrrc23 Δ / Δ testis , the truncated LRRC23 is 165 detected only marginally in the microsome fraction of Lrrc23 Δ / Δ testis , different from full - length 166 LRRC23 enriched in the cytosolic fraction of WT testis ( Figs 2A and EV3A and B ) . In addition , the 167 mutant LRRC23 is not present in epididymal sperm ( Figs 2B and C , and EV3C - E ) , indicating that 168 the C - terminal region is essential for proper LRRC23 transportation to the sperm flagella . 169 170 Sperm from Lrrc23 Δ / Δ and Lrrc23 - 4135del Δ / Δ males are morphologically normal ( Figs 2C and 171 EV3E and F ) and the epididymal sperm counts of Lrrc23 + / Δ and Lrrc23 Δ / Δ males are not 172 significantly different ( Fig 2D ) . Despite the normal morphology and sperm counts , Lrrc23 Δ / Δ males 173 are 100 % infertile ( Fig 2E and F ) . By contrast , Lrrc23 Δ / Δ females are fertile , which supports the IV - 174 4’s infertility is not likely due to the identified variant ( Fig 1A ) . To further understand how the 175 homozygous Lrrc23 mutation causes male infertility , we performed Computer Assisted Semen 176 Analysis ( CASA ) . Lrrc23 Δ / Δ sperm motility parameters are significantly altered compared to 177 Lrrc23 + / Δ sperm ( Fig EV3G ) . Lrrc23 Δ / Δ sperm cannot swim efficiently under viscous conditions that 178 mimic the environment in female reproductive tract ( Fig 2G ; Movie EV1 ) , and their flagella just 179 vibrate but do not beat normally ( Figs 2H and EV3H ; Movie EV2 ) . In addition , inducing 180 capacitation did not rescue any observed motility defect of Lrrc23 Δ / Δ sperm as demonstrated by 181 flagellar waveform analysis , and CASA measurement of curvilinear velocity ( VCL ) , straight line 182 velocity ( VSL ) , and amplitude of lateral head ( ALH ) . These results suggest the C - terminal 183 truncation dysregulates the flagellar localization of the mutant LRRC23 , leading to sperm motility 184 defects and male infertility . 185 186 C - terminal Truncation of LRRC23 Abolishes its Interaction with Radial Spoke Head 187 Recent cryo - ET studies revealed that T - shaped RS structures ( i . e . , head and stalk ) are conserved 188 across the species ( Leung et al . , 2021 ; Lin et al . , 2014 ) ( Fig . 3 A ) . Three RSs ( RS1 , RS2 , and 189 RS3 ) are repeated in a 96 - nm interval along the flagellar axoneme in mammalian sperm , sea 190 urchin sperm , Trypanosoma brucei , and even in C . reinhardtii with stump - like RS3 without a head 191 structure ( Fig . 3 A ) . LRRC23 is a RS protein in chordate axoneme and has been considered 192 especially as the orthologue of RSP15 , a RS2 stalk protein in C . reinhardtii ( Han et al , 2018 ; 193 Satouh & Inaba , 2009 ; Yang et al . , 2006 ; Zhang et al . , 2021 ) ( Fig 3B ) . We initially hypothesized 194 the C - terminal truncation of LRRC23 affects the assembly of a RS stalk and / or its incorporation 195 into the RS2 . Thus , we tested the protein - protein interaction of normal ( hLRRC23 WT ) and mutant 196 ( hLRRC23 Mut ) human LRRC23 with known RS stalk ( RSPH3 , RSPH22 ) or head ( RSHP6A , 197 RSHP9 ) proteins using RSPH - trap assay ( Figs 3C - E and EV4A ) . Purified GST - tagged 198 hLRRC23 WT and hLRRC23 Mut proteins ( Fig 3C and D ) were incubated with a recombinant human 199 RSPH enriched by immunoprecipitation ( Fig 3E ) . This trap assay demonstrated that hLRRC23 WT 200 interacts only with RSPH9 , a RS head protein , among the head and stalk RSPH proteins tested 201 ( Figs 3F and EV4B ) . Interestingly , the previously reported interaction between LRRC23 and 202 RSPH3 ( Zhang et al . , 2021 ) is not detected in our assay , which may be due to the different 203 interaction conditions used in vitro . Markedly , hLRRC23 Mut does not interact with RSPH9 , 204 indicating LRRC23 interaction with RS head via its C - terminus . This result also raises the 205 question whether LRRC23 is a head protein of RS , not a stalk protein , a different picture from 206 previous studies . To test this new hypothesis , we performed BLAST search and found C . 207 reinhardtii RSP15 ( Gui et al . , 2021 ) has the highest sequence homology to LRRC34 , not LRRC23 , 208 in Ciona intestinalis . Our phylogenetic and pairwise distance comparison analyses also revealed 209 that LRRC34 orthologs are evolutionarily closer to RSP15 orthologs than LRRC23 orthologs ( Figs 210 3G and EV4C ) . Moreover , AlphaFold - predicted structure of human LRRC34 , but not that of 211 LRRC23 , presents the same structural features as those of RSP15 ( i . e . , repeated leucin - rich 212 repeat domains and an α - helix motif in - between ) ( Fig 3H ) . LRRC34 and LRRC23 share their 213 7 gene expression patterns among tissues , most abundantly expressed in the tissues known for 214 ciliary and flagellar function such as retina , testis , and fallopian tube ( Fig EV4D and E ) . All these 215 results suggest that LRRC34 is a ciliary and flagellar protein and likely the RSP15 orthologue in 216 chordates , and that LRRC23 function is associated with the RS head . 217 218 LRRC23 Mutation Disorganizes Radial Spoke 3 in Sperm Flagella 219 Next , we examined the impact of LRRC23 loss of function by the C - terminal truncation on the 220 subcellular and ultrastructural organization of sperm . We first compared flagellar 221 compartmentalization between Lrrc23 + / Δ and Lrrc23 Δ / Δ sperm . Confocal imaging of 222 immunostained sperm by antibodies against various proteins of known localization did not show 223 any difference on the subflagellar localization of axonemal or peri - axonemal proteins ( Fig 4A and 224 EV5A ) . The levels of such flagellar proteins are also not significantly different between Lrrc23 + / Δ 225 and in Lrrc23 Δ / Δ sperm ( Fig EV5B and C ) . Furthermore , transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) 226 did not reveal apparent structural abnormalities in Lrrc23 Δ / Δ sperm flagella ( Figs 4B and EV5D ) . 227 These results indicate overall subflagellar and ultrastructural organization in Lrrc23 Δ / Δ sperm is 228 preserved despite almost complete loss of sperm motility . Any structural abnormality in Lrrc23 Δ / Δ 229 sperm would be subtle and local in the axoneme , likely in the RS head region , which requires a 230 higher resolution microscope technique . 231 232 To determine how the absence of LRRC23 affects sperm structure in more detail , we performed 233 cryo - ET 3D reconstruction to visualize substructural changes of the sperm axoneme ( Fig 4C and 234 Movie EV3 ) . The reconstructed tomogram slices revealed striking details of the RS structural 235 difference between WT sperm and Lrrc23 Δ / Δ sperm ( Fig 4C ) . In WT sperm , the three RSs are 236 repeated with a typical pattern , in which RS1 and RS2 are recognized by an additional EM 237 density between them ( barrel structure , Leung et al . , 2021 ) followed by RS3 ( Fig 4C , left ) . In 238 Lrrc23 Δ / Δ sperm , EM densities corresponding to RS3 are significantly weaker than those in WT 239 sperm whereas the structural features of RS1 and RS2 are overall kept unaltered from that of WT 240 sperm ( Fig 4C , right ) . These results strongly indicate that the LRRC23 mutation specifically 241 disorganizes RS3 in the sperm axoneme . 242 243 LRRC23 Is a Head Component of Radial Spoke 3 244 To visualize the structural defects of RS3 along the Lrrc23 Δ / Δ sperm axoneme in more detail ( Fig 245 4C ) , we performed sub - tomogram averaging ( STA ) of the axonemal doublets in 96 nm repeat ( i . e . , 246 the distance that spans a single set of RS1 , RS2 , and RS3 ) on both WT and Lrrc23 Δ / Δ 247 spermatozoa ( Figs 5 and EV6 ) . Remarkably , the resulting 3D maps reveal that the head region of 248 RS3 is entirely missing in Lrrc23 Δ / Δ sperm whereas the heads of RS1 and RS2 are intact ( Fig 5A 249 and B ) . In addition , superimposition of the 3D STA maps demonstrates that the junctional 250 structure between RS2 and RS3 – present in mouse and human sperm but not in C . reinhardtii nor 251 in T . brucei flagellar axoneme – is also specifically abolished in Lrrc23 Δ / Δ sperm ( Fig 5C ) . By 252 contrast , Lrrc23 Δ / Δ sperm have intact stalk structures of RS3 like those in WT sperm . Consistent 253 with the protein - protein interaction between LRRC23 and the RS head protein RSPH9 using the 254 RSPH - trap approach ( Fig 3 ) , these direct structural observations unarguably clarify that LRRC23 255 is a RS3 head component and the absence of the RS3 head leads to motility defects in Lrrc23 Δ / Δ 256 sperm . These results demonstrate that the C - terminal truncation of LRRC23 prevents the 257 assembly of RS3 head during spermatogenesis , thus preventing functional RS3 complex 258 formation . Taken together , our functional and structural studies using the mouse model 259 recapitulating the human mutation elucidate the molecular pathogenicity of LRRC23 underlying 260 impaired sperm motility and male infertility ( Fig 5D ) . 261 262 263 8 Discussion 264 265 LRRC23 is a Distinct Head Component of Radial Spoke 3 266 Accumulating evidence on the structural heterogeneity of radial spokes in cilia and flagella 267 suggests that the molecular organization and function of RS3 is distinct from those of RS1 and 268 RS2 . For example , the morphology of RS3 head is distinguished from those of RS1 and 2 in 269 mouse motile cilia ( Zheng et al , 2021 ) . Moreover , in the tracheal cilia of the PCD patients , RSPH1 270 or RSPH4 loss - of - function mutation specifically abolished RS1 and RS2 heads , but not RS3 head 271 ( Lin et al . , 2014 ; Zhao et al , 2021 ) even though RS3 shares T - shaped structure just like RS1 and 272 RS2 in most eukaryotic motile cilia and flagella ( Imhof et al . , 2019 ; Leung et al . , 2021 ; Lin et al , 273 2012 ; Lin et al . , 2014 ) . Despite these findings , the molecular composition of RS3 head remains 274 largely unknown . The current study demonstrates that LRRC23 is a RS3 - specific head 275 component . Previous immuno - EM studies showed that LRRC23 is a conserved RS protein in C . 276 intestinalis and mouse ( Pigino et al . , 2011 ; Zhang et al . , 2021 ) . It is of note that LRRC23 was 277 originally predicted to be the orthologue of RSP15 in C . reinharditti , a RS2 stalk protein , due to 278 the presence of leucine - rich repeat domains ( Gui et al . , 2021 ; Yang et al . , 2006 ) . Yet , we found 279 LRRC23 orthologues are not conserved in C . reinharditti in which RS3 is headless and short 280 stump - like , but present in the species where RS3 head structure is preserved , such as T . 281 thermophila , sea urchin , and mammals . Instead of LRRC23 , our phylogenetic and structural 282 comparison strongly suggests that LRRC34 is likely the RSP15 orthologue in chordate animals 283 ( Figs 3 and EV4 ) and a previously unappreciated component of RS2 stalk . Identifying a LRRC34 284 loss - of - function mutation from ciliopathic children further supports that LRRC34 is a RS 285 component ( Shamseldin et al , 2020 ) . Our wild type - mutant comparison approach using cryo - ET 286 analyses ultimately clarify that LRRC23 is required for assembling the RS3 head structure ( Figs 4 287 and 5 ) , indicating LRRC23 as a RS3 head component . Interestingly , a RS head component , 288 RSPH9 , interacts with LRRC23 but the protein level or the localization of RSPH9 is not altered in 289 Lrrc23 Δ / Δ sperm ( Fig EV4 ) , suggesting that RSPH9 could be a head component of RS1 and RS2 290 like in C . reinhardtii ( Gui et al . , 2021 ) , but not of RS3 . Of note is that an independent study 291 reported that LRRC23 is required for flagellar localization of the RS stalk and fibrous sheath 292 components in mature sperm ( Zhang et al . , 2021 ) . This discrepancy between two studies is likely 293 due to the presence of the truncated LRRC23 in testis in Lrrc23 Δ / Δ males , which might partly allow 294 flagellar localization of other flagellar components during germ cell development . Although the full 295 picture of molecular composition of RS3 head remains to be revealed , our findings demonstrate 296 LRRC23 is a RS3 - specific head component . This conclusion is further supported by the presence 297 of LRRC23 in tracheal cilia ( Zhang et al . , 2021 ) that lack the RS2 - RS3 bridge structure ( Leung et 298 al . , 2021 ) . 299 300 LRRC23 is required for mammalian sperm - specific bridge structure between RS2 and RS3 301 In motile cilia and flagella , a set of three RSs is repeated along the axoneme ( Leung et al . , 2021 ; 302 Lin et al . , 2012 ; Lin et al . , 2014 ; Viswanadha et al . , 2017 ) . Notably , a recent cryo - ET study 303 revealed additional RS substructures in mammalian sperm flagella , a barrel structure at RS1 and 304 a junctional bridge structure between RS2 and RS3 ( Leung et al . , 2021 ) , which were not 305 observed in the sea urchin sperm or human motile cilia ( Lin et al . , 2014 ) . Furthermore , they are 306 asymmetrically distributed along the mammalian sperm axoneme , corresponding to the peripheral 307 MTDs in a species - specific manner ( Chen et al , 2023 ) . Our cryo - ET and STA analyses visualized 308 the mammalian sperm - specific RS1 barrel and RS2 - RS3 bridge structures in WT sperm flagella , 309 consistent with Leung et al ( Leung et al . , 2021 ) . Strikingly , in Lrrc23 mutant sperm , most of the 310 EM density corresponding to the RS2 - RS3 bridge structure is missing and / or altered together with 311 that of the RS3 head ( Figs 4 and 5 ) . Considering the absence of RS2 - RS3 bridge in tracheal cilia 312 ( Lin et al . , 2014 ) , LRRC23 also contributes to assemble this flagellar RS substructure . Thus , we 313 speculate that the RS3 and RS2 - RS3 bridge structures and their sub - axonemal localization 314 confer non - planar and asymmetric flagellar motility unique to mammalian sperm hyperactivation . 315 As the RS2 - RS3 bridge structure is absent in tracheal cilia ( Lin et al . , 2014 ) , our study 316 unambiguously demonstrates that LRRC23 is required for assembling this bridge structure 317 9 specifically in mammalian sperm flagella . If so , LRRC23 may be localized at the junction between 318 RS2 - RS3 bridge structure and RS3 head . The detailed molecular components that comprise the 319 RS2 - RS3 bridge require further study . Profiling and comparing LRRC23 interactomes from 320 mammalian motile cilia and sperm flagella could unveil the cell - type specific molecular 321 organization of RS3 . 322 323 LRRC23 loss of function causes male infertility in mice and human 324 Loss - of - function mutations in various RS components that are common to motile cilia and sperm 325 flagella were reported to cause PCD and / or male infertility . Loss - of - function mutations of RSPH1 326 ( Knowles et al , 2014 ; Kott et al , 2013 ) , RSPH3 ( Jeanson et al , 2015 ) , RSPH4A and RSPH9 327 ( Castleman et al , 2009 ) were identified from PCD patients . Some of the male patients carrying 328 RSPH1 and RSPH3 mutations were infertile ( Jeanson et al . , 2015 ; Knowles et al . , 2014 ) . RSPH1 , 329 RSPH4A , and RSPH9 knockout mouse models recapitulated the PCD phenotypes such as 330 hydrocephalus and impaired mucociliary clearance ( Yin et al , 2019 ; Yoke et al , 2020 ; Zou et al , 331 2020 ) . However , there are other RS components in which mutations only cause male infertility in 332 mice and human . For example , WES of infertile males without PCD symptoms identified 333 mutations in CFAP251 ( Auguste et al , 2018 ; Kherraf et al , 2018 ) and CFAP61 ( Liu et al . , 2021 ; 334 Ma et al , 2021 ) . RSPH6 ( Abbasi et al . , 2018 ) , CFAP251 ( Kherraf et al . , 2018 ) , or CFAP61 ( Liu et 335 al . , 2021 ) deficiency also rendered male mice infertile but without gross abnormalities . These 336 phenotypic differences could be due to a different physiological role of the individual RS 337 component between motile cilia and flagella or a distinct repertoire of the RS components that 338 permits functional redundancy . In our study , LRRC23 mutant mice do not have any apparent 339 gross abnormality but display male infertility ( Fig 2 ) . Considering the altered interaction of 340 truncated LRRC23 with RSPH9 in vitro ( Fig 2 ) , the LRRC23 interaction with RSPH9 is 341 presumably essential for the RS organization and / or sperm motility in mammals . However , since 342 we only examined the interaction of the human proteins , there may be species - specific 343 differences that need to be further investigated . Consistent with our study , a previous study found 344 immotile sperm but normal tracheal ciliary beating in the absence of LRRC23 ( Zhang et al . , 345 2021 ) . Supportive of these observations , the infertile male patients in the current study do not 346 show PCD symptoms . This phenotype of male infertility without PCD symptoms in both mice and 347 human suggests the mammalian sperm - specific role of LRRC23 in RS structure and function . 348 Physiological implication of LRRC23 and RS3 in motile cilia is unclear but it is likely dispensable 349 for normal ciliary movement probably due to compensatory and / or redundant RS3 proteins 350 specific to cilia . Whether LRRC23 absence would lead to similar structural aberration in RS3 351 head of motile cilia requires further study . Intriguingly , LRRC23 loss - of - function impairs primarily 352 flagellar motility but morphology only marginally , which is in distinct from other RS components . 353 For example , the absence of RSPH6 , CFAP251 , or CFAP61 causes male infertility without PCD 354 symptoms but displays multiple morphological abnormalities of the flagella characterized by 355 absent , short , bent , coiled , and irregular flagella ( Toure et al . , 2021 ) . By contrast , LRRC23 356 mutation and absence do not cause either PCD nor MMAF phenotypes in human and mouse , 357 suggesting a distinct physiological significance of LRRC23 in reduced sperm motility . 358 359 10 Materials and Methods 360 361 Subject and family 362 This study was approved from the review board of Quaid - i - Azam University , Islamabad , Pakistan 363 ( IRB00003532 , IRB protocol # QAU - 171 ) and the Yale Center for Mendelian Genomics . The 364 family members recruited in this study were explained about the procedure and possible 365 outcomes . The family members provided written consent to attend this study . 366 367 Sample collection and clinical investigation 368 Semen Semen samples were collected and clinically analyzed according to WHO guidelines 369 ( World Health Organization , 2010 ) . Semen samples were collected from the infertile male 370 members after 2 - 5 days of abstinence from sexual intercourse . The collected semen samples 371 were subjected to the clinical analysis by expert laboratory technologists at Aga Khan Medical 372 Centre ( Gilgit , Pakistan ) to measure pH , volume , viscosity , and color of the semen and sperm 373 parameters . To assess sperm motility and morphology , the collected semen was liquefied at 37 374 °C for 30 - 60 minutes . A minimum of 1 , 000 spermatozoa were counted to analyze sperm motility 375 by the CASA system using an MTG - GmbH analyzer ( version 5 . 4 ; MTG - MedeaLAB ) according to 376 the unit’s standard operating procedures based on the WHO guidelines as previously reported 377 ( Krause et al , 2016 ; Nawaz et al , 2021 ; Slabbert et al , 2015 ) . Sperm from liquified semen were 378 subjected to PAP - staining and the morphology was microscopically analyzed according to the 379 guidelines from WHO and evaluated by a reproductive medicine specialist . PAP - stained sperm 380 were imaged using CMOS camera ( Basler acA1300 - 200 μ m , Basler AG ) equipped in Nikon E200 381 microscope . 382 Blood Venous blood samples were collected from attending family members . Collected blood 383 samples were used for karyotyping and genomic DNA extraction . Blood cells cultured with 384 phytohemagglutinin for 72 hours were used for karyotyping . The cultured cells were disrupted and 385 Giemsa - stained . Twenty metaphases were examined to examine karyotypes of each member . 386 Genomic DNA ( gDNA ) samples were extracted using QIAamp DNA Kit ( QIAGEN , Germany ) . 387 Extracted gDNA samples were subjected to examine microdeletions at the Y - chromosome 388 ( AZFa , AZFb , AZFc , and AZFd ) , whole exome sequencing ( WES ) , and Sanger Sequencing . 389 390 Whole - Exome Sequencing and Data Analysis 391 Whole exome sequencing was carried out as described in our previous study ( Hwang et al , 392 2021b ) . Briefly , 1 . 0 μ g of genomic DNA from proband’s blood is fragmented to an average length 393 of 140 bp using focused acoustic energy ( Covaris E210 ) . DNA fragments were subjected to 394 exome capturing using the IDF xGen capture probe panel with an additional “spike - in” of ~ 2 , 500 395 region which are total 620 kb of RefGene coding regions . The captured fragments were pair - end 396 sequenced by 101 bp reading using NovaSeq 6000 with S4 flow cell ( Illumina ) . Sequenced reads 397 were aligned to reference human genome ( GRCh37 / hg19 ) using the BWA - MEM ( Li , 2013 ) and 398 processed to generate variants using GATK v3 . 4 ( McKenna et al , 2010 ; Van der Auwera et al , 399 2013 ) . Variants were annotated with ANNOVAR ( Wang et al . , 2010 ) and the predicted 400 deleteriousness of non - synonymous variants was determined by MetaSVM ( Dong et al , 2015 ) . 401 Either loss of function mutations of stop - gains , stop - losses , frameshift indels , and canonical 402 splice - sites or deleterious missense mutations predicted by MetaSVM were considered to 403 potentially damaging . Recessive variants of which MAF values in Genome Aggregation Database 404 ( gnomeAD ) , v2 . 1 ( Lek et al , 2016 ; https : / / gnomad . broadinstitute . org / ) are lower than 10 - 3 were 405 considered for rare variants . Rare damaging variants were further filtered to exclude false - 406 11 positives using the follow criteria : ( 1 ) PASS for GATK variant quality score recalibration , ( 2 ) MAF 407 ≤ 2 . 0 x 10 - 5 in the gnomAD , ( 3 ) DP ≥ 8 independent reads , ( 4 ) GC score ≥ 20 , ( 5 ) MQ score ≥ 40 , 408 ( 6 ) PLdiff / DP ≥ 8 , and ( 7 ) indels in Low Complexity Regions .

Amino acids sequences of LRRC23 609 and LRRC34 orthologs and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii RSP15 were aligned with ClustalW for 610 phylogenetic analysis using MEGA7 ( Kumar et al , 2016 ) . Pairwise distances between the 611 sequences were calculated with default option . An unrooted phylogenetic tree was generated by 612 maximum - likelihood analysis with 500 bootstrap replications . 613 614 Protein structure analysis 615 Radial spoke 2 and RSP15 structures of the C . reinhardtii were from RCSC Protein Data Bank , 616 PDB ( https : / / www . rcsb . org / ; 7JU4 ) . Predicted structures of human LRRC23 ( Q53EV4 ) and 617 LRRC34 ( Q8IZ02 ) were from AlphaFold Protein Structure Database ( Jumper et al , 2021 ; 618 https : / / alphafold . ebi . ac . uk / ) . Protein structures were rendered and visualized by Mol * 3D Viewer 619 at RCSC PDB . 620 621 Tissue and testicular expression analysis 622 Transcript expression data of LRRC23 and LRRC34 in human tissues was obtained from GTEx 623 and is based on The Human Protein Atlas version 21 . 0 and Ensembl version 103 . 38 624 ( https : / / www . proteinatlas . org / about / download ) . Medians of the normalized transcript per million 625 ( nTPM ) are used to calculate relative tissue expression levels . Relative tissue expression levels 626 of LRRC23 and LRRC34 are represented as heatmap using GraphPad Prism 8 . 0 ( GraphPad 627 Software Inc . , San Diego , CA ) . UMAP images for the single - cell expression of LRRC23 and 628 LRRC34 in human testis are obtained from UCSC Cell browser ( Soraggi et al , 2021 ; 629 https : / / cells . ucsc . edu / ? ds = testis ) . 630 631 Transmission electron microscopy 632 Transmission electron microscopy was performed as previous study ( Hwang et al . , 2021b ) . 633 Washed epididymal sperm were pelleted by centrifugation and fixed with 2 . 5 % glutaraldehyde 634 and 2 % paraformaldehyde in 0 . 1M cacodylate buffer pH7 . 0 for 30 minutes at RT and for 1 hour at 635 4 °C . The fixed pellets were briefly washed with 0 . 1M cacodylate buffer pH7 . 0 and placed in 2 % 636 agar . The chilled blocks were trimmed and rinsed with 0 . 1M cacodylate buffer followed by placed 637 in 0 . 1 % tannic acid in 0 . 1M cacodylate buffer for 1 hour . The samples were washed and post - 638 fixed in 1 % osmium tetroxide and 0 . 15 % potassium ferrocyanide in 0 . 1M cacodylate buffer for 1 639 hour . Post - fixed samples were rinsed with the cacodylate buffer and distilled water and subjected 640 to en bloc staining in 2 % aqueous uranyl acetate for 1 hour . The samples were dehydrated with 641 16 ethanol series and infiltrated with epoxy resin Embed 812 ( Electron Microscopy Scienes ) . The 642 resins were placed in silicone molds and backed for 24 hours at 60 °C . The blocks were 643 sectioned in 60 nm depth using Leica UltraCut UC7 and the sections were collected on the 644 formvar / carbon - coated grids . Sections on the grids were stained using 2 % uranyl acetate and 645 lead citrate . The stained grids were imaged using MORADA CCD camera ( Olympus ) equipped in 646 FEI Tecnai Biotwin Transmission Electron Microscope ( FEI , Hillsboro , OR ) at 80 KV . 647 648 Cryo - electron tomography 649 Grid preparation Grids for sample imaging were prepared as a previously report ( Leung et 650 al . , 2021 ) . The Quantifoil R2 / 2 gold grids were glow discharged for 30 seconds at 15mA and 1 . 5 x 651 10 5 cells of WT or Lrrc23 Δ / Δ sperm were loaded on the grids followed by incubation at RT for 1 652 minutes . The grids were blotted manually from the back site for ~ 4 seconds using a manual 653 plunger freezer and immediately plunged into liquid ethane and stored in liquid nitrogen . 654 Cryo - ET data collection Prepared grids with proper ice particles were screened using a 655 Glacios microscope ( 200 KV , ThermoFisher Scientific ) at the Yale Science Hill Electron 656 Microscopy Facility . The screened grids were transferred to the Titan Krios microscope ( 300 KV , 657 ThermoFisher Scientific ) equipped with a Bioquantum Energy Filter and a K3 direct electron 658 detector ( Gatan ) for data collection at the Yale West Campus Electron Microscopy Facility . Data 659 was collected automatically using SerialEM ( Mastronarde , 2005 ) . All images were recorded under 660 super - resolution mode with the physical pixel size 3 . 4 Å ( 1 . 7 Å for super resolution movies ) . 20 661 and 60 tilt series of WT and Lrrc23 Δ / Δ mouse sperm were collected with the Volta phase plate at a 662 target defocus around - 1 µm . Grouped dose - symmetric scheme spanning from - 51° to 51° at 3° 663 increment was applied for tilt series acquisition , with a total dose at 100e - / Å2 . 664 Tomogram reconstruction Process of tomogram reconstruction was streamlined using in - 665 house scripts . The movie frames were aligned first using MotionCorr2 and the micrographs were 666 binned with a factor two ( Zheng et al , 2016 ) . Tilt series stack was generated using in - house 667 script . The tilt - series was aligned by AreTomo 1 . 0 . 6 ( Zheng et al , 2022 ) to generate XF files 668 which are comparable for IMOD ( Kremer et al , 1996 ) . The initial CTF parameters were estimated 669 using Ctffind4 ( Rohou & Grigorieff , 2015 ) . The tomograms were then reconstructed with a binning 670 factor six with 20 . 4 Å pixel size by IMOD with SIRT algorithm for visualization , particle picking and 671 initial sub - tomogram averaging . 672 673 Sub - Tomogram Averaging of 96 - nm axonemal doublet repeat 674 Initial alignment using PEET MTDs were manually traced in IMOD ( Kremer et al . , 1996 ) . After 675 manual tracing , a polynomial function with degree five was fitted to each microtubule doublet with 676 24 nm of a sampling distance ( Fig EV6C ) . The polarity of each tomogram is manually determined 677 to reduce the error during subsequent alignment . The 24 - nm repeat particles were first aligned 678 using PEET Version 1 . 15 . 0 under “Particle model points” and “align particle Y axes” options 679 ( Heumann et al , 2011 ; Nicastro et al , 2006 ) . A published map of 96 - nm MTD repeat in WT 680 mouse sperm ( EMD - 12133 ; Leung et al . , 2021 ) was low - pass filtered to 60 Å and used as the 681 initial reference . A mask covering two adjacent MTDs was generated with 160 x 160 x 160 nm 3 682 dimension of sub - tomogram particle . Only “Phi” angle and translational shifts were searched 683 during the alignment . After the initial alignment , positions of the particles were placed at center 684 based on the translational shifts . The Euler angles were extracted and transformed to RELION 685 Euler angle convention ( ZYZ ) using the MOTL2Relion command in PEET . In - house script was 686 used to gather the coordinates and corresponding Euler angle information for subsequent 687 RELION4 sub - tomogram averaging analysis . 688 17 Refinement and classification After the metadata preparation , the sub - tomogram particles were 689 made in RELION4 ( Zivanov et al , 2022 ) with the binning factor of six . Local 3D refinement with a 690 mask covering one 96 - nm MTD was performed . After refinement , the features pf 24 - nm repeat of 691 outer dynein arm was observed ( Fig EV6D ) . A smaller mask only covering the inner dynein arm 692 and radial spoke was created for the focused classification without alignment ( Fig EV6E ) . After 693 classification , equivalent 96 - nm MTD repeat classes were separated ( Fig EV6E ) . One of the 694 classes was selected for the future process . New sub - tomogram particles with binning factor 695 three and corresponding 10 . 2 Å of pixel size were generated . Another local refinement was 696 performed with a 96 - nm MTD mask . Resolution was estimated using the Fourier shell correlation 697 ( FSC ) at a cut - off of 0 . 143 in RELION4 ( Zivanov et al . , 2022 ) . Details of acquisition parameters 698 and particle numbers are summarized in Table EV3 . 699 Visualization Images for cryo - ET and sub - tomogram averaging were rendered using IMOD 700 ( Kremer et al . , 1996 ) and UCSF Chimerax ( Goddard et al , 2018 ) . 701 702 Statistical analysis 703 Statistical analyses were performed using Student’s t - test or Mann - Whitney U test . Significant 704 differences were considered at * p ≤ 0 . 05 , * * p < 0 . 01 , and * * * p < 0 . 001 . 705 706 Data availability 707 The structures for radial spokes from WT ( EMD - 29013 ) and LRRC23 Δ / Δ ( EMD - 28606 ) sperm 708 resolved by cryo - ET and STA are deposited to Electron Microscopy Data Bank 709 ( https : / / ebi . ac . uk / pdbe / emdb ) . 710 711 Acknowledgments 712 The authors highly appreciate participation of the family members in the study presented here . 713 We also thank Muhammad Umair , Khadim Shah , Imran Ullah , Hammal Khan for their help to visit 714 the family for interviews and participation in clinical assessment , Habibur Rehmen and Rina Raza 715 from Aga Khan Medical Centre for clinical semen analyses , Jong - Nam Oh for preparing samples 716 for WES , Case Porter and Miriam Hill for their help in PCR and Sanger sequencing , the Yale 717 Center for Cellular and Molecular Imaging for assistance in transmission electron microscopy , Dr . 718 Masahito Ikawa from Osaka University for sharing anti - RSPH6A sera .
