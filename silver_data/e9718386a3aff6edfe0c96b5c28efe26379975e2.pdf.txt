Chapter 12 Trends and Innovations in Biosensors for COVID - 19 Detection in Air Geetha Palani , Karthik Kannan , and Devi Radhika Abstract Pandemic is not a word to use lightly or carelessly . It is a word that , if misused , can reason difﬁcult fear , or unwarranted acceptance that the ﬁght is over , foremost to needless suffering and fatality . Coronavirus disease of 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) has become a deadly disease shaking the whole world . All the countries are facing a crisis in disposing of fast diagnostics of the syndrome , able to be organized to a wide number of persons . To control the spread of this virus harmful results of coronavirus have given rise to the growth of analysis tools . In this urgent situation , manyresearchersandscientistsareworkingonﬁndingasolutiontocontrolthedeadlyvirus . In this chapter , we focused on researching biosensors that could detect the virus in the air . People breathe about 11 , 000 L of polluted air that is invisible . The major purpose of this sensor is , it could be used as another method and more signiﬁcant to calculate the concentration of virus in the air , but it won’t be the replacement for laboratory tests . Advanced technology , time - consuming and low - cost equipment for this disease spreading virus is in need to control the pandemic at the earliest . This biosensor is prevalent and can detect even minute amounts of viruses present in the air and surroundings .

Palani et al . 12 . 1 Introduction The ﬁrst plague pandemic , the Justinian plague has occurred between the sixth and eighth centuries AD during the period of the great Roman Empire . During the fourteenth century , Black Death in the pre - modern era was the worldwide second pandemic . The post - industrial age in nineteenth century middle and the beginning of twentieth century that occurred was considered to be the third pandemic all over the country . The primary root cause of plague disease is mainly rodents . By nature , humans can never infect one another , but it is exceptional for rare pneumonic spread . Rat colonies thrived during this spread of plague on coastal ships , and mainly the affected rats were transported from one part of the place to another place to affect humans all over the world . Later the bubonic plague became a crawl disease in the widespread animal population ( epizootic ) , growing fast as the lying beneath rat population increase . In the early twentieth century , after landing by ship to the Indian hinterland the epidemic started to grow as quickly as it can , being carried rapidly with their complement of infected rats with the grain movements through railways [ 1 ] . Later it is , however , reversed to the middle age crawl epizootic to one side from railway links . Cholera was the ﬁrst and foremost modern pandemic in the world , during the nineteenth century it traveled Europe from Asia ensuing the colonial railway link . Why this cholera hasn’t spread in Europe at the beginning through the Indian Ocean trade route ? Still , it stays as a big mystery . Was it is because the cholera pathogen cannot able to survive long outside its warm weather in tropical areas ? There was a mortality decline followed by the public health revolution . In the nineteenth century , not only in Europe , the mortality count started to increase in India , despite there was an improvement in food security , developmental works in modern techs like all roads , railways , and canals that was also the main cause to the rapid growth of this malarial fevers , the population was decreasing till 1921 . Thepresenceofvirusandspreadalwaysgivesagravethreattoentireglobalization . There are several viruses which are mostly infectious but relatively do not spread , results in less death ration such as seasonal ﬂu , and on the other side some viruses are not virulent but highly dangerous , some are Ebola , SAR Syndrome , MER Syndrome , and COVID [ 2 ] . Still , there will be also a hope , the perfect disaster will occur often , a strain both non - infectious and high dangerous to live with the potential of causing death on an overwhelming scale . The life of human worth has changed in a certain period , but half - million mortality from COVID - 19 to date is not so far to be a perfect disaster for humans . Hardly 40 – 50 million people globally claimed the Spanish ﬂu a century ago [ 3 ] . During the ﬁrst two plagues around thirty to ﬁfty and two hundred million lives claimed , respectively , and 10 – 12 million in China as well as in India alone during the third pandemic . In the nineteenth century , it was over 40 million perished from cholera . 12 Trends and Innovations in Biosensors for COVID - 19 … 289 12 . 2 Corona Virus Disease - 19 ( COVID - 19 ) Recently from the last of December 2019 , a whole world person has been getting infected by coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) , to be precise , it’s the ﬁfth pandemic after the ﬂu pandemic occurred in the year 1918 . The ﬁrst and the earliest date of symptoms were started on December 1 , 2019 . The identiﬁcation of these patients , were quite common which includes fever , dry cough , and body pain , and later it was identiﬁed as viral pneumonia [ 4 ] . In the beginning , by the member of the press and media , it was named as “Wuhan pneumonia” based on the virus symp - toms and also its origin place . The whole set of chromosome sequencing pointed to this disease - causing pathogen is a new type of coronavirus . Hence , this disease - causing virus comes in the seventh row of the coronavirus background to affect humans . On January 12 , 2020 , the WHO for the time being termed this new virus as 2019 novel coronavirus disease ( 2019 - nCoV ) and then on of February 12 , 2020 in a formal and public way they named this disease - causing infection as COVID - 19 ( coronavirus disease 2019 ) . WHO on the 11th of March in closing announced the gauging the highly dangerous COVID - 19 can be delineated as a widespread along with the globe , after the 1918 Spanish ﬂu ( H1N1 ) estimated around 50 million human deaths , 1957 Asian ﬂu ( H2N2 ) death rate was nearly 1 . 5 million , 1968 Hong Kong ﬂu ( H3N2 ) the mortality count was one million , and in 2009 Pandemic ﬂu ( H1N1 ) which is 300 , 000 human deaths , respectively . COVID - 19 also spreads like other coronaviruses do , mainly through one person to another contact . Purely the infection depends on the person’s body condition and it may be either for some mild or for some deadly . Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus disease - 2 belongs to the family of seven types of coronavirus ; it includes the deadly virus that causes severe diseases like MERS disease and SARS disease . Seven types of coronavirus are shown in Table 12 . 1 with their causes . It won’t be a serious threat to healthy people like the other coronaviruses affect most of us with the colds during the year . As we all know it is usual for a virus to change , or affect , to infect people . A study has been carried out by the 103 Chinese people with COVID - 19 cases ; the results tell that the virus spread has just done its part . During the process , they found 2 strains , and then they named it as L and S type of strains . We can all know that this S strain is very old , and the L strain is the one that is more common in the early stages of the pandemic . Vaccines are a while off yet , so routine testing is vitally important at this stage of the pandemic to cure the deadly disease . Even when the vaccine is available , people will still need to be tested , and it is one of the most signiﬁcant solutions at the moment in the ﬁght against the coronavirus . One issue with current testing methods is that they produce a high number of false - negative and false - positive results [ 5 ] . Not ideal in the best of times , never mind when public health professionals and health systems are stretched beyond their standard capacity . So , while we currently have routine tests to diagnose if a person has / has had the coronavirus , new and more effective ( i . e . , more 290 G . Palani et al .

There are several researchers and doctors in both academia and industry that are answering the call to control this . 12 . 3 Biosensors and Its Types It is an analytical device , which can be used as a chemical substance detection that combines the physicochemical detector with a biological component . The delicate biological elements such as tissues , micro organisms , antibodies , nucleic acids , etc . , are biological - based materials that tie up or identify the analysis in the process of study . This sensitive biological element is mostly available in the markets and it is generallyproducedbybiologicalengineers . Thetransmittingorthedetectingelement present in the sensor , which sends one signal to another one [ 8 ] , which is works in a physicochemical way like electrochemiluminescence which results in easily measure and quantify the combination of the analyte with the biological element . Biosensors classiﬁcation is given below : A . Electrochemical biosensor B . Optical biosensor C . Thermal biosensor D . Electronic biosensor E . Piezoelectric biosensor F . Gravimetric biosensor 12 Trends and Innovations in Biosensors for COVID - 19 … 291 12 . 3 . 1 Optical Biosensor The optical measurement principle is used in the optical biosensor devices . They also use optical ﬁber as well as optoelectronic transducers for its process . The word opt rode which represents the compression of two terms optical and electrode [ 9 , 10 ] . The main purpose of this sensor is involving in transuding elements like antibodies and enzymes . This biosensor allows us to secure non - electrical inaccessible sensing equipment . One of the extra beneﬁts of this sensor is it doesn’t require / need reference sensors frequently like other sensors . The optical biosensors are broadly divided into two categories such as direct and labeled optical detection biosensors . 12 . 3 . 2 Thermometric Biosensor In our daily life , huge number of biological reactions takes place those are mainly interconnected with heat , and this makes the base for the invention / formation of thermometric biosensors . Usually , these kinds of sensors that deal with heat are referred to as thermal ( heat ) biosensors . To measure / estimate / calculate the serum cholesterol this thermometric - biosensor is used in a wide range [ 11 ] . It is also used for the known glucose value , to ﬁnd the amount of urea , and penicillin G can be done with these biosensors . There are many numerous applications of biosensors available according to the need . The need for a biosensor in our daily activities is tremendous broadly used in the biological area and commercial applications like identifying the target molecules , recognition of biological elements , and the tendency of the disposable portable detec - tion system in some situations [ 12 , 13 ] . Diabetes patients to monitor the glucose levels , targets related to medical health departments , general applications like detec - tion of pesticides for farmers in agriculture and water contaminants ( river , lake ) and some of the metal ion compounds , sensing remotely for the airborne virus in Bioware activities , checking water quality in coastal waters by explaining clam ethnology in groups bivalves around the world in online , pathogens detection , toxic substances determination for bioremediation before and after and organophosphate detection , folic acid , pantothenic acid routine analytical measurement as an alternate for micro - biological assay , drug residues in food determination ( antibiotics and promoting the growth of the viruses , mainly the ﬂesh of an animal and honey ) , biological activity and the origin of new devices , and toxic detection metabolites like mycotoxins [ 14 ] . 12 . 3 . 3 Progress of SARS - Corona Virus Disease All human coronaviruses are basically from animal origins , termed as , natural hosts . Particularly bats are one of the Human coronavirus 229E , SARS - Corona Virus , 292 G . Palani et al . Human coronavirus NL63 , and MERS - Corona Virus which is a natural host . Further , rodents are the main cause of HCoV - OC43 and HKU1 . The less sustaining ability of the RNA - dependent RNA polymerase ( RdRP ) generates mutations mainly due to the replication of RNA viruses . The variation in the genome gives rise by viral RdRP , it would be helpful for the existing organism to stick [ 15 ] . The mutation rates are varying in RNA viruses based on the new hosts are shown in earlier studies . When we look at the same interchange ratio for coronaviruses it may be nearly around 1 × 10 − 3 / synonymous / year , which is very low when compared with some other RNA viruses . Viral exoribonuclease nsp14 is used partially to control the muta - tion rate during coronavirus replication . If not , SARS - COVID 19 has been entering continuously to various groups globally during the widespread [ 16 ] . From the database of GISAID submitted in January 2020 , the data of nCoV - 19 sequences , the virus was earlier identiﬁed in the last December 2019 from China , Wuhan . Though , there is so much variation while comparing the old sequence database with the currently submitted sequences gathered from North America in early 2020 . These viral sequences are changing continuously ; phylogenetic network construction is very hard to ﬁnd the growth of the microorganism in distinct popu - lations and surroundings . Though the microorganism continuously spreading inside the person to person or other human coronaviruses , join together between COVID and past coronaviruses , such as Human coronavirus 229E , OC43 , and HCoV HKU1 , still haven’t found . The research shows that three types of genetic viruses have been spreading / passing worldwide [ 17 ] . The studies also demonstrate that the pathogens may also relate to the environmental location , size of the sample and different analyzing studies are still being an argument in the research ﬁeld . Though there is various research and arguments are going on , it is still not clear that the virus is affected by replication environments like immunological and genetic restrictions with the evolution of SARS - COVID , in varying person populations . The selection process of SARS - COVID mutations with evolutionary pressure is on the process . The examination of the variation in patterns of COVID will provide a detailed database for a different population about vaccine development [ 18 ] . 12 . 4 Analysis and Survey 12 . 4 . 1 Survey Report There are 2 types of rapid Point of Care method that can able to ﬁnd the COVID - 19 virus , ﬁrst one is nucleic acid and antibody ( Ab ) tests . This AB test is generally carried out by ﬁnding the presence of the microorganism in infected human Sputum or through snot i . e . , nose or mouth . Finding the growth of the microorganism at the beginning phase of infection or before the start of the symptoms appears these kinds of tests are acting well , and it will be accurate [ 19 ] . If we see on the other side , the IgG / IgM test—antibody test is carried out by getting an infected person 12 Trends and Innovations in Biosensors for COVID - 19 … 293 blood sample which contains the virus against antibodies . Thevarajan et al . ( 2020 ) says that the basic ﬁnding report says that ﬁve days or about after the early infection stage , the virus usually activates the immune response that stimulates the building of both Immunoglobulin G and Immunoglobulin M in the blood which is ﬁghting against the virus . This body’s immune system could be found in the infected person plasma , serum , or blood [ 20 ] . The present Point of Care biosensors and the available devices in the market for coronavirus 2 are tabulated in Table 12 . 1 . While , compared to the clinical sensitivity and relatively unique , which are 79 – 97 which is higher than already available POC biosensors commercially , quantitative real - time polymerase chain reaction ( qRT - PCR ) , COVID - 19 gold standard . The 86 . 43 – 93 . 75 and 90 . 63 – 100 % , Immunoglobulin G / Immunoglobulin M lateral ﬂow test strip , respectively . 12 . 5 Role of Biosensor in COVID - 19 12 . 5 . 1 Possible Origins of Virus Any tiny / small organism , which includes viruses / bacteria , can become airborne . Contamination in the material can be aerosolized by various methods / ways ; it depends on air to person and animal doing things like coughing , daily activity , sleeping , its breed , etc . [ 21 ] . If an infectious particle is clear and proper , it can stay as an airborne , there are so many to come into proximity neither with animal nor person and possibly form a disease . The statistical ratio of an airborne tiny organism—microorganism causing a spread based on its spreading nature and its capability to withstand the stress of aerosolization [ 22 ] . The latest Chinese health statement suggested that this new coronavirus may spread quickly than what we thought , through an “airborne route . ” This microorganism is now called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 , disease ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) , and the infection it creates are now titled as COVID - 19 [ 23 , 24 ] . This virus can quickly spread over in an open / dirty environment because it tends to grow larger and larger by joining with the airborne particles when compared with the particles in a clean / controlled environment . After all , in clean space , the virus is more likely to remain small and it’s hard to inhale by animals and humans . The main spread / cause of this disease is mainly due to sneezing , coughing , talking , hugging each other at that we sneeze , or spread the particles in a large size . The CDCP of china almost right away changed the announcement , nothing Corona virus - 2 was not considered to be an airborne virus [ 25 , 26 ] . Wet / sticky droplets greater than 5 – 10 millionths of a meter or micrometer which is bigger easily have the nature of falling to the land within minutes / fraction of time or stay on a different surface . These sultry droplets are considered to be the travel risky largest routes for the coronavirus 2 [ 27 ] . But tiny organisms haven’t been involved in the process of CovidVirus - 2 . Tiny particles tend to evaporate quickly in the air so it won’t create high - risk factors ( i . e . , less than 1 / 10 of a second is not wet air ) . 294 G . Palani et al . They will leave some gelatin - like particles which consist of proteins , salts including viruses and these leftovers are generally named as “droplet nuclei” and it is easily inhalable . They may remain for hours or for a long time it depends on the virus , travel , or pass through the air currents via clinics , theatres , shopping malls , colleges , schools , temples , and working place . This is how usually this type of airborne disease spread in animals and humans [ 28 ] . There is more number of ways to spread airborne microorganisms . To affect the humans / animals , the droplet nuclei must contain infectious pathogen and the virus can enter the mucous membranes—our ears , nose , eyelids , mouth , and digestive paths , and this virus can enter our cells and reproduce to infect / affect [ 29 ] . The center in china conﬁrmed that this virus appears to pass through droplets , direct contact with person to person , and by creating contact with contaminated / affected surfaces , persons , and objects . Once the infected person leaves the room measles virus can stay or withstand in a room for nearly 30 min , there are more chances to infect quickly . Same way , the MERS coronavirus has been recorded in the infectious state from clinical air samples and found to be dangerous . Other viruses that may infect or spread through an airborne way include the main causes of rhinoviruses , the common cold and ﬂu viruses [ 30 ] . Habitual respiratory viruses which develop through airborne particles means it won’t be a surprise to detect coronavirus 2 and this ability . The spreading of this virus is through airborne means the virus could travel faster and furthermore . It can also spread via contaminated air , highly crowded places and reach humans additionally from the affected person , despite them not in their straight line of sight [ 31 ] . Anderson and his collaborators concluding this based on sequencing genomic analysis that is potential beginning for coronavirus 19 - 2 will be through one of the two possible attempts . On one hand , the virus use the nonhuman host i . e . , particles , substances , or objects as a medium to jump on the humans . Likewise , the previous ﬁrst coronavirus spread has emerged and caused the infection , with persons catching the virus after direct exposure to civets ( coronavirus 1 ) and camels . The scientists of this group suggested that bats are the main transmitter for SARS - CoV - 2 as it is the same as a bat coronavirus [ 32 ] . Still , now there is no reported case of straight transmission of person to bats , anyhow , proposing that a median host was involved between humans and bats . Second case , the distinctive features of coronavirus 2 and spike protein shows the similar RBD portion that binding in the cleavage site and cells that open the microor - ganism up it would have evolved to their present condition earlier to human entry [ 33 ] . The ongoing epidemic would probably have spread vastly as earlier as persons were getting infected , as the virus would have already progressed the condition to develop it as a pathogenic and can increase among the humans . The research work report says that the virus of a non - pathogenic version can jump from humans into animal hosts and then progress to its present pathogenic condition inside the human population . From the ﬁndings , some coronaviruses from pangolins , from Asia and Africa found mammals like an armadillo , which have an RBD structure very same to that of Corona virus - 2 . A spread from pangolin might 12 Trends and Innovations in Biosensors for COVID - 19 … 295 be passed on to humans , civets or ferrets used maybe pass straight or through some medium of the host [ 34 , 35 ] . Another prominent method to know the spike protein nature of COVID - 2 - 19 , within the human host the cleavage site could have evolved , maybe through limited undetected circulation before the start of the epidemic in the human population . The researchers also research and found that the corona virus - 2 cleavage site resembles the same to the strains of bird ﬂu cleavage sites , it can be easily transmitted among one human to another human . Corona virus - 2 could have evolved such a deadly cleavage site in human cells and soon it will vanish the ongoing epidemic , as the coronavirus could have become far more capable of spreading between humans [ 36 ] . 12 . 5 . 2 Detection of Coronavirus in Air RT - PCR a molecular method is mainly used for most of the laboratories or laboratory works , to ﬁnd how the virus spreads in respiratory organs ? It is a most familiar method and used to ﬁnd even micro count presence of viruses and apart from this , this method consumes more time , easily detectable , and no error - prone [ 37 , 38 ] . Jing Wang and his group from Materials Science and Technology , the Swiss Federal Laboratory had developed another testing methodology in the new kind of biosensor , where two different effects connected to ﬁnd the tiny virus in a short time safely and more accurately : i . e . , through an optical and thermal biosensor technique [ 39 ] . The researchers explained that this sensor consists of a glass substrate with a very small structure of gold , basically named as gold nanoislands . On elaborating they produced artiﬁcial receptors of DNA that coincides exactly with the sequences of the COVID - 2 RNA which is mounted on the nanoislands . Alternatively , this COVID is also known as RNA virus : Generally , this coronavirus has not to consist of a double - strand DNA genome as in surviving organisms , but of an RNA single strand genome as in living organisms . According to the researchers , the receptors on the sensor acting as a unique RNA sequence are therefore the complementary sequences to the microorganism , which can ﬁnd the virus in less time [ 40 , 41 ] . The technology used by the researchers for the detection purpose is termed to be localized surface plasmon resonance ( LSPR ) . This is based on the principle of optical biosensor principle that takes place in nanostructures made by metallic : Suppose if thevirusstartstoreact , itactivatesthestrikinglightinaparticularrangeofwavelength and forms a plasmonic near - ﬁeld on all sides of the nanostructure . The molecules present in the exciting plasmonic near - ﬁeld changes , the local refractive index bind over the surface they noticed . An optical sensor situated at the backside of the device could be helpful to calculate the change and it could ﬁnd / say neither the sample contains the RNA strands nor not [ 42 , 43 ] . SARS - Corona virus and SARS - COVID2 , the two deadly viruses vary only a bit in their RNA strand apart from that there is no difference . “Tests showed that the sensor can clearly distinguish between the very similar RNA sequences of the two viruses . ” By using this biosensor we have no need to wait for a long time to get 296 G . Palani et al . the results , and they will be available in a fraction of time . However , this sensor is still not available to calculate the concentration of the coronavirus in the air by this time of need . The research is focussed mainly in the developmental methods to make this possible for instance , the pathogen that spreads in the environment / air , reduces / removes the aerosols in the air and the RNA is releasing from the viruses it takes some more time to use this product [ 44 ] . While the biosensor is not an alternative to clinical diagnostics , the scientists see the system potentially operating in crowded environments . For ease of use , the integrated system will be a portable device that can be used for rapid detection in public areas , such as train stations and hospitals [ 45 , 46 ] . To ﬁnd the virus on time and accurately , the sensor combines two different effects : optical and thermal . Because the coronavirus genome is a single RNA strand , the sensor features a false DNA receptor that matches with the speciﬁed RNA sequences of the COVID - 19 . The receptors are usually mounted on the sensor’s gold “nanoisland , ” which are placed on a glass substrate . The biosensor is based on an optical process termed as localized surface plasmon resonance , or LSPR . The nanostructures made of metallic , while moving , modulate the particular light in a correct wavelength range and form a plas - monic near - ﬁeld region near the nanostructure [ 47 ] . The conﬁned refractive index in the exciting near - ﬁeld plasmonic region modiﬁes its position when molecules attach to the surface [ 48 ] . The thermal aspect of the sensor offers secondary conﬁrmation of detection . To maintain a constant high temperature to eliminate nonspeciﬁc bind - ings , a laser is applied to the sensor during the whole detection process [ 49 ] . The plasmonic photothermal ( PPT ) effect produces localized heat and raises the ambient temperature , allowing only the RNA strands of the virus to join with the nanoisland receptors [ 50 , 51 ] . To demonstrate the sensor’s accuracy , the researcher tested their sensor’s ability to detect SARS - CoV , a closely connected virus . In 2003 , pandemic broke out the SARS - Corona virus , which triggered the SARS pandemic , and its RNA only differs slightly . From the result , the sensor could differentiate between the exact RNA sequences of the two different viruses [ 52 , 53 ] . Our proposed dual - functional plasmonic technology can accurately discriminate against the viral sequence and perform quantitative detection . Therefore , we hope that it can be applied to study the transmission of airborne viruses and assess the virus threat in the air . To achieve this aim , it requires a fully integrated system [ 54 ] . This system will contain several important subunits including the air sampling unit and these developed biosensors . For ease of use , the integrated system will be a portable device that can be used for rapid detection in public areas , such as train stations and hospitals . We need to further integrate the air sampling unit and biological processing unit into the ﬁnal system . These two subunits can facilitate the online fast detection of airborne virus by collecting the airborne virus and extracting the viral sequence . We are currently working on these developmental works in parallel [ 55 , 56 ] . At present , this new type of optical sensor has demonstrated its practical potential . We hope that more efforts can participate in the development of similar novel technologies . Although some of these emerging technologies cannot be put into use in the short 12 Trends and Innovations in Biosensors for COVID - 19 … 297 term , more participation in scientiﬁc research will speed up their development . As of now the work is not completely faded out : ﬁrst the virus started to develop in China and then globally even before the COVID - 19 , at the beginning of January 2020 , the usage of this sensor is not advisable and so to improve the process of the device / sensor in a more effective to ﬁnd a particular virus accurately [ 57 , 58 ] . The main ultimate motto of this sensor is not replacing the already available laboratory methods , but it can work as other test methods for medical purpose and assist in the diagnosis process , and more conspicuous to calculate the virus aggregation in the environment / air in day to day life : For instance , in busy places like bus stations or colleges , public gatherings [ 59 ] . New test methods are in urge for the ﬁnding of the coronavirus to normal and the pandemic under control as earlier as possible with fast test results and accuracy . Some of the latest technology growth for coronavirus fast detection and their different speciﬁcation by researchers are shown in Table 12 . 2 . In Table 12 . 3 the considerable biomarkers for sensing are tabulated . The ideal demonstrative test has both high affectability and particularity ( genuine negative rate ) . The affectability is accounted for along with the limit of detection ( LoD ) . The LoD sets the most reduced grouping of SARS - CoV - 2 RNA that can be identiﬁed by the RT - PCR test , which is controlled by distinguishing the nearness of the viral RNA in at any rate 95 % of the cases . For coronavirus examines , the LoD can arrive at levels lower than 10 genome Table 12 . 2 Types of available sensor for coronavirus detection , source from [ 75 – 77 ] S . no Technologyusedforsensing Analyte Detection limit Answertimeofthesample Carepoint ?

Some of the precautions to be taken to avoid this virus are listed below : ( 1 ) Limit close contact between infectious people and others . Ensure a social distance of nearly around one meter from another person . In areas where COVID - 19 is circulating and the distance cannot assure us , so better wear a mask [ 61 ] . ( 2 ) Find the infected people quickly and isolate them as much as soon and care for and all of their close contacts can be quarantined in appropriate facilities . ( 3 ) Clean hands , and during cough and sneezing cover with a cloth or tissue or bent elbow at all times . ( 4 ) Avoid public gatherings , close - contact meetings , and restricted and enclosed spaces with poor ventilation . ( 5 ) Indoor settings must be ensuring good ventilation , including homes and ofﬁces . ( 6 ) Stay home if feeling unwell and call your medical provider as soon as possible to determine whether medical care is needed [ 62 ] . ( 7 ) In countries or areas where COVID - 19 is circulating , health workers should use medical masks continuously in their daily activities in clinical areas in health care facilities [ 81 ] . 12 Trends and Innovations in Biosensors for COVID - 19 … 299 ( 8 ) Health workers must use additional personal protective equipment and safety measures must be taken care when helping / treating for coronavirus infected person . More details for medical professionals are available here and here [ 63 ] . ( 9 ) Workplaces should have in place protective measures , details here . ( 10 ) During the cleaning process , it is mandatory to wear disposable gloves and gowns and needs to change it often , if not there is a huge chance to get infected quickly . So it requires loads of advanced protective equipment [ 64 , 65 ] . ( 11 ) On a regular basis , all ﬂoors , counters , bathrooms , housekeeping surfaces should be cleaned , or when some third person entered in . Hot water , Dettol , or any kind of detergent can be used as a disinfectant [ 66 , 67 ] . ( 12 ) There is more number of ways of diluted disinfectant mixtures to get contam - inated with resistant pathogens . So it is compulsory to discard the remaining mixtures and clean the container with detergents [ 68 , 69 ] . ( 13 ) To avoid cleaning solution contamination , it should be reduced . Two buckets can be used for the wetting of mop . Suppose if you are using a single bucket , the detergent must be changed often [ 70 ] . ( 14 ) Outside walls , gates , windows , and door curtains should be cleaned when it gets contaminated or if you see dust particles [ 71 ] . This corona virus has taken over our lives , ﬁlling everything with a deafening silence and a distressing void that stops everything as it passes by ; “we feel it in the air / surrounding / environment . We ﬁnd ourselves afraid and lost . ” “Healing people , not saving ( money ) to help the economy ( is important ) , healing people , who are more important than the economy . People are temples of the Holy Spirit , the economy is not . ” We all ﬁght together and against this deadly virus . 12 . 7 Conclusion Current evidence suggests that COVID - 19 spreads between people through direct , indirect such as spread via contaminated objects or surfaces , or close contact with infected people via mouth and nose secretions . These include sputum , secretions , or death rattles . Usually , these are secreted from the open pores like mouth and nose when an affected person sneezes , coughs , talks , or kisses , for example . People who are in direct contact within the range of one meter with an affected person can catch COVID - 19 when those infectious droplets get into their throat , nose , or eyelids . To avoid contact with these wet particles , it is must / compulsory to stay away at least one meter away from the infected person , wash your hands often in running water , and cover the lips and jaws with a tissue or mask or hand key while sneezing or coughing ; it will reduce the spread . When standing one meter or more away is not possible , wearing a fabric mask is an important measure to protect others . Cleaning hands frequently is also critical . Shortly , if we ﬁnd an airborne route , it does not consider being the major transmission of the virus . This sensor can be used as another method and more precisely to know the virus aggregation in the 300 G . Palani et al . surrounding / air in day to day life , but it won’t be the replacement for laboratory tests . Advanced technology , time - consuming and low - cost equipment for the current coronavirus is in need to bring the pandemic under control at possible earliest . This biosensor is well deﬁned , advanced , and can detect even very small amounts of viruses present in the air and environment . Acknowledgements Dr .
