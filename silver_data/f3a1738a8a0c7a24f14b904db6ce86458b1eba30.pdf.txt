Gerardo Monza , Universit(cid:2) degli Studi , Milan - Bicocca , Italy Abstract Background : The “baby lung” concept originated as an off - spring of computed tomography ex - aminations which showed in most patients with acute lung injury / acute respiratory distress syndrome that the normally aerated tissue has the di - mensions of the lung of a 5 - to 6 - year - old child ( 300 – 500 g aerated tissue ) . Discussion : The respiratory system compliance is linearly related to the “baby lung” dimensions , sug - gesting that the acute respiratory distress syndrome lung is not “stiff” but instead small , with nearly normal intrinsic elasticity . Initially we taught that the “baby lung” is a distinct an - atomical structure , in the nondepen - dent lung regions . However , the density redistribution in prone posi - tion shows that the “baby lung” is a functional and not an anatomical concept . This provides a rational for “gentle lung treatment” and a back - ground to explain concepts such as baro - and volutrauma . Conclusions : From a physiological perspective the “baby lung” helps to understand ventilator - induced lung injury . In this context , what appears dangerous is not the V T / kg ratio but instead the V T / ”baby lung” ratio . The practical message is straightforward : the smaller the “baby lung , ” the greater is the potential for unsafe mechanical ventilation . Keywords Acute respiratory distress syndrome · Baby lung · Baro - / volutrauma · Mechanical ventilation · Respiratory system compliance · Ventilator - induced lung injury Introduction Adult respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) was first described in 1967 [ 1 ] . It is worth rereading the original paper as it clearly outlines the basic physiopathology and management problems which continue to be a matter of scientific debate . The 12 patients described there had ARDS of pulmonary and extrapulmonary origin , some with fluid overload and shock . Positive end - expiratory pressure ( PEEP ) was applied in five of them ( three sur - vived ) and zero end - expiratory pressure ( ZEEP ) in the remaining seven ( two survived ) . Respiratory system compliance ranged from 5 to 16 ml / cmH 2 O , all patients were hypoxemic , and PCO 2 ranged from 22 to 69 mmHg . At autopsy the lungs were heavy ( average 2110 g ) , and microscopic examination revealed areas of alveolar atel - ectasis , interstitial and alveolar hemorrhage and edema , dilated and congested capillaries . Interestingly , PEEP was described as a “buying time maneuver , ” preventing al - veolar collapse at end - expiration . How does the “baby lung” fit into this framework ? The concept was introduced in the middle 1980s [ 2 ] , but be - fore discussing its place a brief history of the ARDS physiopathology and treatment is necessary . Some of the “new” concepts are nothing more than rediscoveries . Often , as new knowledge progresses , old knowledge is abandoned or forgotten . 777 From the 1970s to the middle 1980s To understand the progress of research in this period it is important to realize that the ultimate , undisputed target in ARDS patients was to maintain normal arterial PCO 2 and PO 2 . Maintaining normal PCO 2 was not considered a problem , as it was common to use high pressure and volume ventilation , with tidal volume ( V T ) even ex - ceeding 20 ml / kg . Actually the recommended standard care was V T between 12 and 15 ml / kg [ 3 ] . The most common side effects were pneumothorax and pulmonary hyperinflation , collectively termed barotrauma [ 4 , 5 ] . To improve PaO 2 the key maneuver , after the report by Ashbaugh et al . [ 1 ] , was to apply PEEP . To investigate its mechanism Falke et al . [ 6 ] first tested the effect of in - creasing PEEP from 0 to 15 cmH 2 O in ten patients with ARDS . PEEP improved PaO 2 linearly , and the putative mechanism was the prevention of alveolar end - expiratory collapse and / or airway closure . That study reported a decrease in lung compliance with high PEEP and variable hemodynamic responses , as in some patients cardiac output rose and in others it fell . It is important to recall that at that time the major concern with PEEP was the possible hemodynamic impairment caused by the increase in intrathoracic pressure . In 1975 Suter et al . [ 7 ] published their investigation on the “optimum PEEP . ” For the first time the relationship between lung mechanics and hemodynamics was ap - proached in a structured fashion . Defining optimum PEEP as that which achieves not the best PaO 2 but the best oxygen transport ( cardiac output (cid:3) oxygen content ) , they found it to be associated with the highest compliance of the respiratory system . The hypothesis that was success - fully tested , explicitly stated by the authors , is that the best compliance indicates that recruitment prevails over alveolar overdistension . It is impossible to cite all the subsequent reports dealing with this concept , but in our opinion those that have introduced a new view of the problem were the ones by Lemaire et al . [ 8 ] and Kirby et al . [ 9 ] Lemaire et al . [ 8 ] suggested that the “minimal PEEP” to keep the lung open is 2 cmH 2 O higher than the lower inflection point on the inflation limb of the volume pressure curve [ 8 ] . At the other end of the spectrum stood Kirby et al . [ 9 ] who proposed the “super PEEP” concept , defined as the pressure that maximally reduces shunt ( down to 20 % at 20 torr ) [ 9 ] . For many years beginning in the middle 1970s the overall picture can be summarized as follows : ARDS lungs were regarded as homogeneously heavy and stiff . To achieve normal PCO 2 high volume and pressure ventilation was required , and to ensure normal oxygen - ation high FIO 2 and PEEP were necessary , although the criteria for selecting PEEP were elusive . At that time the recognized side effects were ventilation - induced baro - trauma , and the major concern was the hemodynamic impairment due to PEEP and high FIO 2 . A new perspective was opened by Hill et al . [ 10 ] who described the successful treatment of a young trauma patient with long - term membrane lung oxygenation . This led the National Institutes of Health in the United States to sponsor the first multicenter randomized trial on ARDS [ 11 ] : 42 patients were randomized to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( ECMO ) and 48 to conventional care . Overall mortality in both groups was near 90 % . To highlight the thinking at that time it is worth noting that both groups were treated with high - volume / pressure ventilation , and that the only difference was the lower FIO 2 in the group receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation . At about the same time , after extensive experimental work showing that it was possible to control breathing by extracorporeal removal of CO 2 [ 12 , 13 , 14 ] , we began to treat severe ARDS patients with this technique [ 15 ] , the aim being to provide “lung rest” avoiding high - volume / pressure mechanical ventilation [ 16 ] . With this technique we could dissociate CO 2 removal and oxygenation ; the first was achieved with a low - flow venovenous extra - corporeal membrane lung and the second by apneic oxygenation through the natural lungs which were kept substantially immobile , being ventilated with only 3 / 5 bpm . At that time we had no scientific rationale for the “lung rest , ” except for the clinical observation of severe traumatic damage induced by high - volume / pressure ven - tilation . With extracorporeal CO 2 removal the gas ex - change targets were again , as in the early 1970s , normal PCO 2 and normal PO 2 . Middle 1980s : the “baby lung” concept Surprisingly the first reports on computed tomography ( CT ) examinations appeared only in the middle 1980s [ 17 , 18 , 19 ] . CT dramatically changed our view of ARDS [ 20 ] . What was considered a “homogeneous lung , ” as usually shown by anteroposterior radiography , appeared non - homogeneous on CT , with the densities concentrated primarily in the most dependent regions ( Fig . 1 ) . When we began a quantitative assessment of CT images , which measures the amount of normally aerated , poorly aerated , overinflated , and nonaerated tissue , we found that the amount of normally aerated tissue , measured at end - ex - piration , was in the order of 200 – 500 g in severe ARDS , i . e . , roughly equivalent to the normally aerated tissue of a healthy boy of 5 / 6 years . From this finding came the concept of “baby lung , ” as an offspring of CT examina - tions [ 2 ] . As expected , the amount of nonaerated tissue was correlated with the degree of hypoxemia , the shunt frac - tion , and pulmonary hypertension . What was absolutely new , however , was the finding that respiratory compliance was well correlated only with the amount of normally aerated tissue and not with the amount of nonaerated tissue 778 [ 21 ] . In other words , compliance appears to “measure” the dimension of the “baby lung” [ 22 ] ( Fig . 2 ) . We then dis - covered that the ARDS lung is not “stiff” at all , but small , and that the elasticity of the residual inflated lung is nearly normal , as indicated by the specific tissue compliance ( compliance / normally aerated tissue ) [ 21 , 23 ] . When we first elaborated these concepts , we believed that the “baby lung” was a healthy anatomical structure , located in the nondependent regions of the original lungs . This model helped account for the disaster observed during high - volume and pressure mechanical ventilation . It was easily understandable that ventilating the lung of a healthy child with , for example , 1000 ml V T , would destroy it . The relationship between the “baby lung” size and compliance explained why , on quite a large ARDS population with similar gas exchange impairment ( referred to our hospital for extracorporeal support ) , only the patients with com - pliance below 20 ml / cmH 2 O ( “baby lung” approx . 20 % of the original lung ) actually received extracorporeal assis - tance while the others , with similar gas exchange but better compliance , could be treated with alternative methods [ 16 ] . Moreover , the “baby lung” concept fitted neatly with the concept of volutrauma ( straining of the “baby lung” ) in - troduced by Dreyfuss et al . [ 24 ] . This helped provide a solid rational basis for trying to achieve “lung rest . ” As soon as we realized that the “baby lung” was located primarily in the nondependent lung regions , we started to use the prone position . The goal was to improve oxygen - ation by increasing perfusion of the anatomical “baby lung , ” which was expected to be dependent in the prone position . Oxygenation did actually improve in the majority of patients . However , when we examined CT images in the prone position to confirm the theory [ 25 ] , we found that the Fig . 1 Anteroposterior chest radiography ( right ) and CT— apex , hilum , and base— ( left ) in ARDS from sepsis , taken at 5 cmH 2 O end - expiratory pres - sure . Chest radiography shows diffuse ground glass opacifica - tion , sparing the right upper lung . CT shows inhomogeneous disease and both the craniocau - dal and sternovertebral gradi - ents . ( From Gattinoni et al . [ 20 ] ) Fig . 2 Starting compliance ( Cstart ) as a function of residual in - flated lung expressed as percentage of the expected normal lung volume . ( Redrawn from Gattinoni et al . [ 22 ] ) 779 densities were redistributed in the dependent lung [ 26 ] , thus demolishing the notion of the “baby lung” as a dis - crete , healthy anatomical structure ( Fig . 3 ) . From “baby lung” to “sponge lung” To understand the mechanism of lung density redistri - bution in the prone position we applied regional analysis , studying the lung composition along the sternum - verte - bral axis [ 26 , 27 ] . The main findings can be summarized as follows : all the lung parenchyma in ARDS is involved by the disease process , and the edema is evenly dis - tributed from the sternum to the vertebra , i . e . , not gravi - tationally , as observed previously [ 28 , 29 ] and after [ 30 , 31 ] ex vivo and in experimental animals . The increased lung weight , due to the accumulated edema , raises the hydrostatic pressures transmitted throughout the lung , which we called superimposed pressure . Consequently the gas in the dependent lung regions is squeezed out by the heavy lung parenchyma above ( Fig . 4 ) . The densities in the dependent lung regions are in fact due not to an in - crease in the amount of edema but to a loss of alveolar gases , as the result of the compressive gravitational for - ces , including the heart weight [ 32 , 33 ] . This model , which Bone [ 34 ] called “sponge lung , ” accounts , although not completely , for the redistribution of the lung densities in prone position : the superimposed hydrostatic pressure is reversed , and the ventral regions instead of the dorsal are compressed [ 35 ] . The sponge lung also partly explains the mechanism of PEEP : to keep open the most dependent lung regions PEEP must be greater than the superimposed pressure [ 23 ] . Unfortu - nately , this unavoidably leads to overdistension of the lung regions with lower superimposed pressure ( Fig . 4 ) . That superimposed pressure is the main cause of collapse was inferred from the human studies cited above and , years later , was directly confirmed experimentally in animals [ 36 ] although this view was challenged [ 37 , 38 ] . In the context of “sponge lung” the “baby lung” still has value if considered from a functional , not an anatomical , perspective . In a broad sense the “baby lung” concept can be applied to any kind of ARDS as every patient has a reduced amount of normally aerated tissue . The sponge lung model , however , implies different considerations . It assumes that the edema is evenly dis - tributed throughout the lung parenchyma . While this is likely when the noxious stimulus leading to ARDS orig - inates from the blood , i . e . , all the lung parenchyma is exposed as in extrapulmonary ARDS , the picture may differ when the noxious stimulus comes from the airways , and distribution may possibly be nonhomogeneous ( as in pulmonary ARDS ) [ 39 , 40 ] . This , however , remains to be verified , although CT differences between pulmonary and extrapulmonary ARDS have been reported [ 41 , 42 ] . The “baby lung” at end - inspiration New information was obtained , with further refinement of the model , when not only end - expiration but also end - inspiration was explored . We found that during inspira - tion part of the lung is recruited [ 43 ] . This has been shown in humans and in experimental animals both with [ 36 , 44 ] and without CT [ 45 ] . These findings suggest the follow - Fig . 3 CT of ARDS lung in supine ( upper ) , prone ( middle ) , and return to supine position ( lower ) . The images were taken at end expiration and 10 cmH 2 O PEEP . Note how gravity - dependent densities shift from dorsal to ventral within minutes when the pa - tient is turned prone . ( From Gattinoni et al . [ 20 ] ) 780 ing scheme ( Fig . 5 ) : the opening pressures are widely and normally distributed throughout the lung parenchyma both in humans and in experimental models , with the mode between 20 and 25 cmH 2 O of airway pressure . Some lung regions , however—usually the most depen - dent—may require opening pressure up to 45 cmH 2 O . It follows that during inspiration new tissue continuously opens to the plateau pressure . Of course , if the plateau pressure is limited , say , to 25 cmH 2 O , all collapsed tissue with a higher opening pressure stays closed throughout the entire respiratory cycle . At end - expiration the PEEP , if adequate , can keep open only the lung regions that were already opened by the plateau pressure [ 36 , 44 ] . CT examinations at end - inspiration did in fact clearly focus the relationship between the end - expiratory and end - inspiratory pressures , which may be relevant and are dis - cussed below in the context of the lung protective strategy . During inspiration the “baby lung” augments its own pa - renchyma through newly recruited tissue up to the inspi - ratory plateau pressure . This complicates the interpretation of the pressure / volume curve . In fact the amount of tissue explored between end - expiration and end - inspiration in ARDS is not the same as in the normal lung which simply inflates . In ARDS during inspiration the “baby lung” gains both gas and tissue , and the gas volume / pressure curve is similar to the recruitment / pressure curve [ 20 ] . The “baby lung” and the protective lung strategy : changing the goals As discussed above , the concept of “baby lung” fully jus - tified the goal of lung rest . With extracorporeal CO 2 re - moval we were able to fully provide lung rest , but at the price of the side effects of extracorporeal circulation ( pri - marily bleeding ) . In the 1990s Hickling et al . [ 46 ] intro - duced low V T ventilation to “rest the lung . ” This technique , referred to as “permissive hypercapnia , ” to underline the price paid for resting the lung , had been used with success in asthma patients [ 47 ] . In our opinion , however , the real “revolution” was not the use of low tidal volume but the change of the goal . For nearly 20 years this had been normal gas exchange , but from the 1990s the accepted target became gentle lung treatment while maintaining adequate oxygenation and accepting high PCO 2 [ 48 ] . The “baby lung” and “VILI” Anatomical and physiological basis of ventilator - induced lung injury We recently reviewed the physical and biological triggers of ventilator - induced lung injury ( VILI ) [ 49 ] and briefly discuss them now in relation to the “baby lung . ” The lung’s fibrous skeleton is the structure that bears the forces applied by mechanical ventilation . The skeleton consists of two fiber systems : an axial system which is anchored to the hilum and runs along the branching air - ways down to the alveolar ducts , and a peripheral system which is anchored to the visceral pleural that goes cen - tripetally down into the lung to the acini . The two systems are linked at the level of the alveoli and form a continu - um , the lung skeleton [ 50 ] . The anatomical units of the system are extensible elastin and inextensible collagen which is “folded” in the lung resting position ( Fig . 6 , left panel ) . The lung cells ( epithelial and endothelial ) do not bear the force directly but are anchored ( via integrins ) to the fibrous skeleton and must accommodate their shape when the skeleton is distended . The limits of distension are of course dictated by the inextensible collagen fibers , which work as a “stop - length” system . When the collagen fibers are fully unfolded , the lungs reach their maximal volume ( total lung capacity ) and further elongation is Fig . 4 Schema representation of sponge model . In ARDS the “tissue , ” likely edema in the early phase , is almost doubled in each lung level compared with normal , indicating the nongravitational distribution of edema . The increased mass , however , causes an increased superimposed pressure ( SP ; cmH 2 O ) , which in turn leads to a “gas squeezing” from the most dependent lung regions . Su - perimposed pressure is expressed as cmH 2 O . ( The values are taken from Pelosi et al . [ 27 ] ) 781 prevented ( Fig . 6 , right panel ) . This is true for the whole lung as well as for each lung region , which has its own “total regional maximal capacity . ” When a force is applied by the ventilator , the fibers of the lung skeleton develop an internal tension ( spatial molecular rearrangement ) , equal to but opposite the pressure applied to the fibers . The applied pressure is not the airway pressure but the transpulmonary pressure ( PL ) , i . e . , the airway pressure minus the pleural pressure . The fiber tension is called “stress . ” In an elastic structure such as the lung skeleton , the stress is associated with elon - gation ( D L ) of the fibers from their resting position ( L 0 ) , and this is called “strain” ( D L / L 0 ) . Stress and strain , in - deed , are two faces of the same coin , and are linked as follows : stress = K (cid:1) strain , where K is Young’s module of the material [ 51 ] . If the stress exceeds the tensile properties of the col - lagen fibers up to “stress at rupture , ” the lung undergoes the classical “barotrauma . ” When the strain , without reaching the levels of physical rupture , is unphysiological ( volutrauma ) , the macrophages , endothelial , and epithe - lial cells anchored to the lung skeleton are stretched ab - normally [ 52 , 53 , 54 , 55 , 56 , 57 ] , the mechanosensors are activated [ 58 , 59 , 60 ] , cytokines are produced [ 61 , 62 , 63 ] , and full - blown inflammation develops [ 64 ] . Stress and strain in the “baby lung” From this perspective , VILI is nothing more than the global / regional excessive stress and strain applied to the “baby lung . ” The rough equivalent of the stress in the whole lung is the PL , while the equivalent of the strain is the change in the size of the lung from its resting position , i . e . , the ratio of V T to the size of the “baby lung” at end - expiration ( ZEEP ) : PL ( i . e . stress ) = K (cid:1) [ ( V T / baby lung ) ] ( i . e . strain ) . The link between stress and strain , K , is the specific lung elastance ( E spec = PL / V T (cid:1) “baby lung” ) , which is the pressure at which the “baby lung” ( end - expiratory lung volume ) doubles in size , i . e . , when V T / ”baby lung” = 1 . The issue is more complicated ( but the overall concept does not change ) when PEEP is applied . In fact , the ef - fects of PEEP are twofold . On the one hand , PEEP may overdistend the already open lung , increasing stress and strain ( i . e . , the numerator of above equation increases ) . On the other hand , PEEP may keep open new lung por - tions , increasing the resting end expiratory lung volume ( i . e . , the denominator of the above equation increases , stress / strain decreases ) . The final effect should be de - tected in every patient , who may show varying amounts of recruitable lung . We do not know the safe limits of mechanical venti - lation , but they can be discussed against a physiological and anatomical background . In the normal lung doubling the resting volume occurs at approx . 80 % of total lung capacity , and at this level of strain ( V T / end - expiratory lung volume = 1 ) most of the collagen fibers are unfolded , and PL equals the specific elastance , which is normally 12 . 5 cmH 2 O . We found that specific elastance in the “baby lung” is near normal [ 21 , 23 ] . If so , considering the upper limits of physiological strain between 0 . 8 and 1 as “safe” ( although we do not know ) , the “safe” PL should not exceed the specific elastance ( approx . 12 – 13 cmH 2 O ) . To prevent VILI , by applying stress and strain within physiological limits , we must take the V T / ”baby lung” ratio , not the V T / kg ratio . For example , in a 70 - kg ARDS patient the “baby lung” dimension may be highly vari - able , say 200 , 400 , or even 800 ml . A 6 ml / kg V T [ 65 ] applied to these different “baby lungs” would result in three different sets of global [ stress and strain ] , i . e . , [ 26 . 3 cmH 2 O and 2 . 1 ] , [ 13 . 1 cmH 2 O and 1 . 1 ] , Fig . 5 Upper Percentage of inspiratory capacity ( black lines ; solid black line also percentage of recruitment ) and percentage of dere - cruitment ( dashed gray line ) as function of airway pressure .

Vertical lines Example of airway pressures used during mechanical venti - lation , plateau pressure 25 cmH 2 O ( solid line ) and PEEP 10 cmH 2 O ( dashed line ) . At 25 cmH2O airway pressure nearly 60 % inspira - tory capacity , 40 % of lung units are still closed . At 10 cmH 2 O PEEP nearly 35 % undergoes opening and closing . ( Data from Crotti et al .

If we eventually verify ( work is in progress ) that E spec is constant or within narrow limits in ARDS , knowing either the PL or the “baby lung” dimension will be suf - ficient to tailor stress and strain , so that they remain within physiological limits . Unfortunately , none of the variables needed to estimate stress and strain are mea - sured routinely in the ICU . So far we have considered PL as a single value , but in fact it changes along the vertical axis of the lung . In supine position the PL gradient is steeper than in prone position [ 26 ] . This suggests that strain and stress are distributed more evenly in the prone position , and this is the rationale for its application in ARDS , independently of gas ex - change , as we recently observed experimentally [ 66 ] . Conclusion The “baby lung” is a model , with all the limits inherent to models . However , it is useful for the interpretation of both physiopathology and treatment . The “baby lung” is ac - tually the “small” lung open at end - expiration ; it may become larger during inspiration due to newly recruited tissue , according to the recruitment - pressure curve and the opening pressure distribution . The “baby lung” is not healthy but it is aerated . Its specific elastance , however , is usually near - normal . The smaller the “baby lung , ” the greater the potential for VILI . Barotrauma ( PL , stress ) and the volutrauma - biotrauma ( V T / end - expiratory lung vol - ume , strain ) are linked to the “baby lung” by the fol - lowing relationship , which clearly indicates that the smaller the “baby lung” the greater the stress / strain : PL = E spec (cid:1) ( V T / baby lung ) . The final message is straight - forward : Treat the “baby lung” gently . Low PL , low V T , and prone position are the means to hand today .
