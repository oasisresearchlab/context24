Using all the arti - cles published in Web of Science in 2000 , we deﬁne the degree of interdisciplinarity of a given article as the percentage of its cited references made to journals of other disciplines . We show that although for all disci - plines combined there is no clear correlation between the level of interdisciplinarity of articles and their cita - tion rates , there are nonetheless some disciplines in which a higher level of interdisciplinarity is related to a higher citation rates . For other disciplines , citations decline as interdisciplinarity grows . One characteristic is visible in all disciplines : Highly disciplinary and highly interdisciplinary articles have a low scientiﬁc impact . This suggests that there might be an optimum of interdisci - plinarity beyond which the research is too dispersed to ﬁnd its niche and under which it is too mainstream to have high impact . Finally , the relationship between interdisciplinarity and scientiﬁc impact is highly deter - mined by the citation characteristics of the disciplines involved : Articles citing citation - intensive disciplines are more likely to be cited by those disciplines and , hence , obtain higher citation scores than would articles citing non - citation - intensive disciplines . Introduction Over the last 40 years and especially since the pub - lication of Gibbons et al . ’s ( 1994 ) seminal book on the new production of knowledge , interdisciplinarity ( and its analogous concepts of transdisciplinarity , multidisciplinar - ity , crossdisciplinarity , etc . ) has been regarded as something positive which should be encouraged . In this respect , it has generated a great deal of theoretical and empirical literature [ see , among others , the collective book edited by Wein - gart & Stehr , 2000 as well as several national ( COSEPUP , 2004 ) and international ( OECD , 1998 ) policy reports ] . One of the issues surrounding interdisciplinarity often discussed is its effect on the scientiﬁc impact of articles . Though Received July 10 , 2009 ; revisedAugust 12 , 2009 ; acceptedAugust 12 , 2009 © 2009 ASIS & T • Published online xxx in Wiley InterScience ( www . interscience . wiley . com ) . DOI : 10 . 1002 / asi . 20226 this question already has been analyzed , especially in the context of the British RAE—where the question whether AQ1 researchers involved in interdisciplinary research should be evaluated differently from those doing disciplinary research was raised—these studies are usually based on a small sam - ple of disciplines , university departments , or journals . For instance , measuringinterdisciplinarityatthelevelofjournals , Levitt andThelwall ( 2008 ) found that in the natural and health sciences , multidisciplinary research ( deﬁned as articles pub - lished in journals to which more than one discipline has been attributed ) have less scientiﬁc impact than does disciplinary research . In the social sciences , both types of research obtain similar citation rates . Using the interdisciplinarity of cited references among Thomson Current Contents 88 subject categories and discipline - normalized citation counts of two research - intensive United Kingdom universities ( N = 37 , 000 articles ) , Adams , Jackson , and Marshall ( 2007 ) found that the most interdisciplinary articles were in fact cited as much as the average article . They also found that the cited ref - erences of the most cited articles had average levels of interdisciplinarity . Finally , using physics research programs in the Netherlands as a case study , Rinia , van Leeuwen , and van Raan ( 2002 ) showed that absolute bibliometric indi - cators are indeed biased against interdisciplinary research . In particular , programs at the periphery of physics have received lower scores on nonnormalized bibliometric indi - cators such as absolute number of citations and impact factors of journals in which they publish . Relative bibliomet - ric indicators , however , correct for this bias . Taken together , these divergent results are likely a reﬂection of the differ - ent operational deﬁnitions of interdisciplinarity used in these studies . The goal of this article is to revisit the relationship between interdisciplinarity and scientiﬁc impact by compiling bib - liometric data for all disciplines at the article level on thepercentageofreferencesmadetodisciplinesotherthantheoneofthecitingarticle . Following the OECD’s ( 1998 ) deﬁni - tions , this article deﬁnes interdisciplinarity as the integration of different disciplines working on a common object .

Each article obtains a “degree” of interdisciplinarity based on its percentage of references made to articles of other disciplines . We then measure the relation between the degree of interdisciplinarity thus deﬁned and the scientiﬁc impact of the citing articles . The next section of this article details the method used . It is followed by the presentation of the results and then by a discussion and our conclusion . Methods When measured using bibliometric methods , the concept of interdisciplinarity has been operationalized in different manners ; however , most studies follow the method used by Porter and Chubin ( 1985 ) , which measures the degree of interdisciplinarity of a article by using the percentage of citations received by the article from a different discipline or specialty or the percentage of the references it contain from a different discipline or specialty . Note that in the ﬁrst case , interdisciplinarity is deﬁned through the practice of the authors of the article who decide what to refer to ; in the sec - ond case , interdisciplinarity is deﬁned through the uses of the article by the other disciplines who cite it . This indicator is indeed very similar to that used at a more microlevel by Tomov and Mutafov ( 1996 ) for andrology and reproduction , by Rinia et al . ( 2001 ) for physics , by Morillo , Bordons , and Gómez ( 2001 ) for chemistry , and by Rinia et al . ( 2002 ) for AQ2 all ﬁelds of science . Adams et al . ( 2007 ) also used the pro - portion of cited references made to different disciplines , to which they add the number of distinct source categories cited as well as the Shannon Diversity Index . On the other hand , Rinia , van Leeuwen , and van Raan ( 2002 ) deﬁned it as the percentage of articles from a group of researchers that is published outside their “main” discipline . For example , the degree of interdisciplinarity of physicists is the percentage of their articles published in journals out - side the discipline of physics . Finally , Levitt and Thelwall ( 2008 ) , in a study of the scientiﬁc impact of interdisciplinary research , deﬁned interdisciplinarity articles as articles pub - lished in journals to which more than one discipline has been attributed ( either by Thomson Reuters’ Web of Science ( WoS ) or by Elsevier’s Scopus ) . This method also was used by Morillo , Bordons , and Gómez ( 2003 ) . Though this oper - ationalization of interdisciplinarity ( or of multidisciplinary ) is simple to understand , the fact that a journal is attributed to more than one discipline does not imply that articles published in this journal are actually “interdisciplinary” arti - cles . Such a journal could be publishing disciplinary articles from different disciplines without necessarily having a dialog between the disciplines covered . This is the case , for example , of multidisciplinary journals such as Nature and Science . Our analysis uses all articles published in the Year 2000 in journals covered by Thomson Scientiﬁc’s WoS , which includes the Science Citation Index Expanded ( SCIE ) , the Social Sciences Citation Index ( SSCI ) , and the Arts and Humanities Citation Index ( AHCI ) . For each document indexed in Thomson’s databases ( source items ) , a list of ref - erences is included . This allows us , following Porter and Chubin ( 1985 ) , to use the relationship between the disci - plines of the cited and citing documents to measure the degree of interdisciplinarity of articles . The Year 2000 was chosen because it allowed enough time for the items to be cited and thus permit the calculation of their impact . The disciplinary classiﬁcation of journals used in this article is that of the U . S . National Science Foundation ( NSF ) . 1 This classiﬁcation cat - AQ3 egorizes each journal into a single discipline and specialty . Since the NSF classiﬁcation excludes the arts and human - ities , we categorized journals of the AHCI as belonging to either arts or humanities . Our classiﬁcation includes 143 spe - cialties which can be regrouped into 14 disciplines . Given the limits of bibliometric data for the measurement of the social sciences and , more important , the arts and humanities ( Archambault , Vignola - Gagné , Côté , Larivière , & Gingras , 2006 ; Larivière , Archambault , Gingras , & Vignola - Gagné , 2006 ) , the trends observed for these domains must be inter - preted with caution . We nonetheless included these two ﬁelds to measure the full spectrum of interdisciplinarity . Rinia’s ( 2007 ) thesis presented two levels of interdisci - plinarity : “big” and “small” interdisciplinarity . Big inter - disciplinarity refers to interdisciplinarity occurring between different disciplines ( e . g . , chemistry and physics ) while small interdisciplinarity refers to interdisciplinarity between different specialties ( e . g . , organic chemistry and applied chemistry ) . In this article , we limit the analysis to “interdisci - plinarity , ” deﬁned as relations between different disciplines , and leave out “interspecialty , ” deﬁned as links between dif - ferent scientiﬁc specialties irrespective of their discipline . Thus , the degree or level of interdisciplinarity of a article is deﬁned as its percentage of references made to articles assignedtoadisciplinedifferentfromthatofthecitingarticle . This percentage , of course , varies from 0 to 100 % . For exam - ple , an article published in a chemistry journal that includes 12 references to articles published in chemistry journals and 8 references to journals in other disciplines ( physics , clini - cal medicine , etc . ) —for a total of 20 citations—obtains an interdisciplinarity index of 40 % ( 8 of 20 ) . A limitation of this method is that only references made to other source items in the database can be assigned to a given discipline . Globally , this represents about 65 % of all cited references , all disciplines combined . This percentage varies between disciplines and represents 79 % of references in medical ﬁelds , 61 % in the natural sciences , 37 % in the social sciences , and only 5 % in the arts and humanities . This large variation between disciplines is a reﬂection of the pro - portion of their references made to journal articles ( Larivière et al . , 2006 ) . By construction , only articles with at least one AQ3 1 More details on the classiﬁcation can be found at : http : / / www . nsf . gov / statistics / seind06 / c5 / c5s3 . htm # sb1 2 JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY—January 2010 DOI : 10 . 1002 / asi AA uu tt hh oo rr PP rr oo oo ff asi6101 _ 0246 _ 21226 . tex 19 / 9 / 2009 20 : 1 Page 3 Natural Sciences and Medicine 671 , 524 papers Social Sciences 69 , 835 papers Arts and Humanities 9 , 384 papers 0 % 5 % 10 % 15 % 20 % 25 % 30 % 35 % P e r c en t age o f pape r s 0 % 5 % 10 % 15 % 20 % 25 % 30 % 35 % 0 % 10 % 20 % 30 % 40 % 50 % 60 % 70 % 0 % 20 % 40 % 60 % 80 % 100 % % of interdisciplinary references 0 % 20 % 40 % 60 % 80 % 100 % % of interdisciplinary references 0 % 20 % 40 % 60 % 80 % 100 % % of interdisciplinary references FIG . 1 .

Scientiﬁc impact measures presented here are similar to those developed by Schubert and Braun ( 1986 ) and by Moed , De Bruin , and van Leeuwen ( 1995 ) . Hence , to take into account the fact that publication and citation practices vary according to disciplines , all impact measures are normalized by the world average of each specialty . Three measures of sci - entiﬁc impact are compiled : ( a ) average of relative citations ( ARC ) received by articles , ( b ) average of relative impact factor ( ARIF ) of journals in which the articles are published , and ( c ) percentage of articles published in the top - 5 % most cited articles . To take into account the different aging pat - terns of articles and journals in the social sciences and in the humanities ( Larivière , Archambault , & Gingras , 2008 ) , the ARC of articles is calculated using a 5 - year citation win - dow following the publication year and excludes ﬁrst - author self - citations . In the calculation of the impact factors , the asymmetry between the numerator and the denominator has been corrected . ARIF and ARC measures above ( or below ) 1 mean that they are above ( or below ) the world average in their respective discipline . Results Figure 1 presents , for three broad disciplinary categories , the distribution of articles by ( rounded 2 ) percentage of inter - disciplinary references . One can readily see that a signiﬁcant share of the articles—one third in both social sciences and natural sciences and medicine , and two thirds in arts and humanities—are essentially disciplinary ( < 5 % of references made to other disciplines ) . The very low level of inter - disciplinarity of the arts and humanities is consistent with observations of Morillo et al . ( 2003 ) . In social sciences and in arts and humanities , we see that both extremes have a high number of articles while the intermediate levels between 5 and 95 % are about equally distributed . Among the ﬁelds included in social sciences , only health - related articles fol - lowadifferenttrend : Thenumberofarticlesincreaseslinearly with the percentage of interdisciplinarity . In natural sciences and medicine , however , we see a continuous decrease in the proportion of articles with the rise of the level of interdisci - plinarity , followed by a slight increase for the highest level of interdisciplinarity ( > 95 % of references outside the article’s discipline ) . Globally , the majority of articles have a low level of interdisciplinarity , and a minority of articles have a high score on this interdisciplinarity index . Figures 2 and 3 present , for social sciences and humanities and natural sciences and medicine , the relationship between the interdisciplinarity of references and the scientiﬁc impact of articles—ARC , ARIF , and percentage of articles in the top - 5 % articles . Most histograms show that the highest lev - els of disciplinarity and interdisciplinarity have signiﬁcantly lower impact scores than those in the middle range . This char - acteristic is observed in all disciplines : Purely disciplinary ( < 5 % ) and purely interdisciplinary articles ( > 95 % ) obtain , on average , lower citation rates , are published in lower impact factor journals , and are less likely to be among the 5 % most cited articles . This suggests that articles that are either too disciplinary or too interdisciplinary are perhaps too main - stream or too much dispersed and , hence , do not attract as much attention as do articles with a more balanced mix of cited articles from different disciplines . Apart from this common characteristic of the histograms , two different patterns emerge from the data : each of them correspondingtoadifferentgroupofdisciplines . Theﬁrstpat - tern , exempliﬁed by the disciplines of biomedical research , earth and space science , physics , and professional ﬁelds is that scientiﬁc impact is negatively correlated with higher interdisciplinarity . In other words , in these disciplines , arti - cles having more references to articles published in journals belonging to other disciplines obtain , on average , lower impact scores . Among these disciplines , biomedical research is the discipline in which this relation is the most obvious , with r 2 valuesof0 . 82forARC , 0 . 88forARIF , and0 . 89forthe top - 5 % articles . The second pattern is that higher interdisci - plinarity is linked with an increase of the scientiﬁc impact of 2 Percentages between 0 and 4 . 99 are compiled as 0 , those between 5 and 14 . 99 as 10 , and so on .

This is the case of biol - ogy , clinical medicine , health ( social sciences ) , humanities , and psychology . Finally , for the disciplines of arts , chemistry , engineering , mathematics , and social sciences , only extremes values of interdisciplinarity ( < 5 % and > 95 % of outside - discipline references ) are lower , but no distinct pattern can be seen in the middle - range values . Discussion and Conclusion Though it is often implicitly suggested that being more interdisciplinary is inherently good for research , such a con - clusion is rarely based on solid empirical data and constitutes more of a wish than a tested fact . Instead of taking the level of interdisciplinarity as a deﬁnition of “good research , ” we have measured the relation between the level of interdisciplinar - ity of individual articles—deﬁned through the disciplinary structure of their references—and their scientiﬁc impact , using three indicators ( ﬁeld - normalized citation rates , impact factor , and percentage of top - 5 % most cited articles ) . Our results show that although there is no clear correlation for all disciplines combined between the degree of inter - disciplinarity of articles and their citation scores , there are nonetheless some disciplines in which higher levels of inter - disciplinarity are linked with higher citation rates , and other disciplines where high levels of interdisciplinarity correlate with a lower citation rate . One characteristic is , however , observed in all disciplines : The highest levels of disciplinar - ity as well as the highest levels of interdisciplinarity ( < 5 and > 95 % , respectively , of references to other disciplines ) have lower scientiﬁc impact than do the articles whose lev - els of interdisciplinarity is between those extremes . This suggests that there might be an optimum of interdisciplinarity beyond which the research is too dispersed to ﬁnd its niche and under which it is too mainstream to have high scien - tiﬁc impact . In biomedical research and to a lesser extent in physics , earth and space sciences , and professional ﬁelds , a higher degree of interdisciplinarity is correlated with lower citationrates . Ontheotherhand , inbiology , clinicalmedicine , humanities , psychology , and health ( social sciences ) , a mod - erate interdisciplinarity is associated with higher citation rates . The difference between disciplines in the relation linking interdisciplinarity and scientiﬁc impact could be related to the characteristics of the disciplines cited . For instance , these differences could be explained by the fact that some disci - plines ( e . g . , biomedical research and clinical medicine ) are more citation - intensive than are mathematics or engineering ( Wallace , Larivière , & Gingras , 2009 ) . Hence , articles hav - AQ4 ing more interdisciplinary linkages with those ﬁelds might be more cited by these disciplines . We tested this hypothe - sis using all physics articles published in 2000 ( Table 1 ) and found that , indeed , physics articles citing more than 50 % of biomedical research and clinical medicine articles had statis - tically signiﬁcant higherARC values than did physics articles citing less than 50 % of articles from such disciplines . The opposite phenomenon is observed for all other disciplines— except , of course , physics itself—but is more striking for non - citation - intensive disciplines such as mathematics and engineering . To provide more insight into this relationship , we also measured the correlation , for each physics article , between the percentage of its references made to a discipline and the percentage of citations received from this discipline . More precisely , is a physics article for which 35 % of the references 4 JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY—January 2010 DOI : 10 . 1002 / asi AA uu tt hh oo rr PP rr oo oo ff asi6101 _ 0246 _ 21226 . tex 19 / 9 / 2009 20 : 1 Page 5 0 0 20 40 60 % 80 100 0 , 5 1 1 , 5 2 A RC Biology 0 20 40 60 % 80 100 0 0 , 2 0 , 4 0 , 6 0 , 8 1 1 , 2 1 , 4 A R I F 0 20 40 60 % 80 100 0 % 1 % 2 % 3 % 4 % 5 % 6 % 7 % T op 5 % pape r s 0 20 40 60 % 80 100 0 0 , 2 0 , 4 0 , 6 0 , 8 1 1 , 2 A R I F 0 20 40 60 % 80 100 0 0 , 2 0 , 4 0 , 6 0 , 8 1 1 , 2 1 , 4 A RC Earth and Space 0 20 40 60 % 80 100 0 % 1 % 2 % 3 % 4 % 5 % 6 % 7 % 8 % 9 % T op 5 % pape r s 0 20 40 60 % 80 100 0 0 , 2 0 , 4 0 , 6 0 , 8 1 1 , 2 1 , 4 Clinical Medicine ARC 0 0 , 2 0 , 4 0 , 6 0 , 8 1 , 2 1 , 4 0 20 40 60 % 80 100 0 % 1 % 2 % 3 % 4 % 5 % 6 % 7 % 8 % 9 % 0 20 40 60 % 80 100 0 0 , 2 0 , 4 0 , 6 0 , 8 1 1 , 2 1 , 4 0 20 40 60 % 80 100 0 0 , 2 0 , 4 0 , 6 0 , 8 1 1 , 2 1 , 4 Physics 0 20 40 60 % 80 100 A RC 0 % 1 % 2 % 3 % 4 % 5 % 6 % 7 % 8 % 0 20 40 60 % 80 100 0 20 40 60 % 80 100 0 0 , 2 0 , 4 0 , 6 0 , 8 1 1 , 2 1 , 4 Chemistry 0 0 , 2 0 , 4 0 , 6 0 , 8 1 1 , 2 0 20 40 60 % 80 100 0 % 2 % 4 % 6 % 8 % 10 % 12 % 0 20 40 60 % 80 100 0 0 , 2 0 , 4 0 , 6 0 , 8 1 1 , 2 1 , 4 0 20 40 60 % 80 100 0 0 , 5 1 1 , 5 2 Mathematics 0 20 40 60 % 80 100 0 % 1 % 2 % 3 % 4 % 5 % 6 % 7 % 0 20 40 60 % 80 100 0 20 40 60 % 80 100 0 0 , 2 0 , 4 0 , 6 0 , 8 1 1 , 2 1 , 4 Biomedical Research 0 20 40 60 % 80 100 0 0 , 2 0 , 4 0 , 6 0 , 8 1 1 , 2 1 , 4 0 % 2 % 4 % 6 % 8 % 10 % 12 % 14 % 0 20 40 60 % 80 100 0 0 , 2 0 , 4 0 , 6 0 , 81 1 , 2 1 , 4 1 , 6 1 , 8 0 20 40 60 % 80 100 0 0 , 5 1 1 , 5 2 Engineering 0 20 40 60 % 80 100 0 % 1 % 2 % 3 % 4 % 5 % 6 % 7 % 8 % 0 20 40 60 % 80 100 FIG . 3 .

Unsurpris - ingly , physicsarticleshavingahighershareoftheirreferences made to biomedical research articles were more likely to receive citations from biomedical research articles . This cor - relation was strong for all disciplines of the natural sciences and medicine , with Pearson’s r between 0 . 50 and 0 . 63 . This clearly shows that the relationship between interdisciplinar - ity and scientiﬁc impact is highly determined by the citation characteristics of the disciplines involved , as articles citing citation - intensive disciplines are more likely to be cited by those disciplines and , hence , obtain higher citation rates than are articles citing non - citation - intensive disciplines . This fact has important consequences on the interpretation given to the relation between citations and interdisciplinarity , as it shows that higher citation is linked to the citation - intensive disci - plines and not necessarily to the intrinsic quality of the article itself . Thus , a strictly rigorous measure of the link between citation and quality of articles should compare articles with the same composition of interdisciplinary references .
