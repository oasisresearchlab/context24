In this study , we examined the role of lipid rafts and raft - associated glycosylphosphatidyli - nositol ( GPI ) - anchored proteins in the process by which Helicobacter pylori vacuolating toxin ( VacA ) intoxicates cells . We first investigated whether GPI - anchored pro - teins are required for VacA toxicity by analyzing wild - type Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) cells and CHO - LA1 mutant cells that are defective in production of GPI - anchored proteins . Whereas wild - type and mutant cells differed markedly in susceptibility to aerolysin ( a bac - terial toxin that binds to GPI - anchored proteins ) , they were equally susceptible to VacA . We next determined whether VacA physically associates with lipid rafts . CHO or HeLa cells were incubated with VacA , and Triton - insoluble membranes then were separated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation . Immunoblot analysis revealed that a substantial proportion of cell - associated toxin was associated with detergent - resis - tant membranes ( DRMs ) . DRM association required acid activation of the purified toxin prior to contact with cells , and acid activation also was required for VacA cytotoxicity . Treatment of cells with methyl - (cid:1) - cyclodex - trin ( a cholesterol - depleting agent ) did not inhibit VacA - induced depolarization of the plasma membrane , but interfered with the internalization or intracellular localization of VacA and inhibited the capacity of the toxin to induce cell vacuolation . Treatment of cells with nystatin also inhibited VacA - induced cell vacuolation . These data indicate that VacA associates with lipid raft microdomains in the absence of GPI - anchored proteins and suggest that association of the toxin with lipid rafts is important for VacA cytotoxicity . Helicobacter pylori are Gram - negative bacteria that colonize the human gastric mucosa . Infection with these organisms consistently results in gastric inflammation and is a risk factor for the development of peptic ulcer disease , distal gastric ade - nocarcinoma , and gastric lymphoma ( 1 , 2 ) . Many H . pylori strains secrete a toxin ( VacA ) that exerts a variety of effects on epithelial cells in vitro , including the formation of large intracellular vacuoles , formation of anion - selective pores in the plasma membrane , apoptosis , and epithelial monolayer permeabilization ( 3 – 5 ) . Several studies in animal models have suggested that VacA is an important virulence factor produced by H . pylori . In a mouse model , a VacA - producing strain exhibited an enhanced capacity to colonize the stomach compared with an isogenic vacA - mutant strain , particularly in co - infection experiments ( 6 ) . Studies in mouse and gerbil models also have suggested that VacA contributes to gastric mucosal injury ( 7 , 8 ) . Analyses of H . pylori isolates from humans have revealed that strains isolated from patients with peptic ulcer disease typically pro - duce VacA proteins with detectable cytotoxic activity in vitro ( encoded by vacA alleles belonging to the type s1 family ) , whereas strains isolated from patients with no history of peptic ulcer disease commonly produce VacA proteins that lack de - tectable cytotoxic activity in vitro ( encoded by vacA alleles belonging to the type s2 family ) ( 9 – 14 ) . The vacA gene encodes a 140 - kDa protoxin , which undergoes cleavage of an amino - terminal signal sequence and cleavage of a carboxyl - terminal peptide to yield an 88 kDa secreted toxin ( 3 – 5 , 15 ) . Secretion of VacA occurs via an autotransporter mechanism ( 16 ) . When isolated in a purified form from broth culture supernatant , VacA is in an oligomeric state consisting predominantly of dodecameric or tetradecameric flower - shaped structures ( 17 – 19 ) . These oligomeric forms of VacA are rela - tively inactive when added to eukaryotic cells in vitro ( 18 , 20 , 21 ) . However , exposure of purified VacA to acidic or alkaline pH conditions results in disassembly of VacA oligomers into monomeric subunits and is associated with a marked increase in its cytotoxicity ( 18 , 20 – 22 ) . Thus , it is presumed that VacA toxicity requires binding of monomeric forms of the toxin to the plasma membrane . Following binding of VacA to the surface of eukaryotic cells , the toxin can insert into the plasma membrane to form anion - selective channels ( 23 – 26 ) and can also be internalized ( 20 , 27 , 28 ) . Intracellular expression of VacA by transient tranfection with VacA - encoding plasmids results in the formation of intra - cellular vacuoles that are indistinguishable from those that form when VacA is added to the outside of cells ( 29 , 30 ) , sug - gesting that this toxin acts intracellularly . HEp - 2 cells express - ing dominant negative mutants of two proteins required for clathrin - dependent endocytosis ( Eps 15 and dynamin II ) de - velop cellular vacuoles in response to VacA ( 31 ) , which suggests that VacA internalization can occur via a clathrin - independent endocytic pathway . It has been proposed that VacA toxicity requires localization of the toxin in either endosomes or mito - chondria ( 28 , 32 ) . One current model for understanding the cytotoxic effects of VacA proposes that its cell - vacuolating ac - tivity results from the formation of anion - selective channels in * This work was supported in part by National Institutes of Health Grants DK53623 and AI39657 and by the Medical Research Service of the Department of Veterans Affairs .

Alternatively , it is possible that VacA might have novel intracellular activities distinct from membrane channel formation ( 5 , 33 , 34 ) . In summary , there continues to be considerable uncertainty about the site of VacA action and the molecular mechanisms underlying its toxic activity . In recent years , it has been recognized that a variety of pathogens and toxins interact with microdomains in the plasma membrane known as lipid rafts ( 35 ) . Lipid rafts are membrane microdomains that are enriched in cholesterol , sphingolipids , and glycosylphosphatidylinositol ( GPI ) 1 - an - chored proteins ( 36 – 39 ) . Several bacterial , viral , and parasitic pathogens seem to use rafts as a site for gaining entry into mammalian cells ( 40 , 41 ) . In addition , certain bacterial toxins , including aerolysin , perfringolysin O , cholera toxin , and teta - nus toxin , utilize rafts as either a site for high affinity binding and oligomerization on the surface of cells or as a site for internalization into host cells ( 42 – 46 ) . A recent study reported that treatment of HEp - 2 cells with phosphatidylinositol - spe - cific phospholipase C ( PI - PLC ) , an agent that removes GPI - anchored proteins from the cell surface , inhibited the capacity of VacA to induce cell vacuolation ( 31 ) . It also was reported that incubation of the cells with nystatin ( a cholesterol - binding agent ) inhibited VacA - induced cell vacuolation ( 31 ) . Based on these results , it was proposed that the presence of one or more GPI - anchored proteins and intact membrane lipid rafts are required for VacA cytotoxicity . Specifically , it was hypothesized that VacA monomers might bind to GPI - anchored proteins and that lipid rafts might act as concentrating platforms enabling VacA to concentrate locally and oligomerize efficiently ( 31 ) . However , there has not yet been any direct evidence indicating that VacA physically interacts with either GPI - anchored pro - teins or lipid rafts . In the current study , we provide biochem - ical evidence indicating that VacA associates with lipid raft microdomains and report that the presence of GPI - anchored proteins is not required for either association of the toxin with rafts or VacA - induced cell vacuolation . In addition , we present data suggesting that VacA interaction with lipid rafts is an important feature of the process by which VacA intoxicates cells . MATERIALS AND METHODS Purification of H . pylori VacA and Aeromonas Proaerolysin— VacA was purified in an oligomeric form from culture supernatant of H . pylori strain 60190 , as described previously ( 18 , 20 , 23 ) . In most experiments , purified VacA was acid - activated by the slow addition of 200 m M HCl to the toxin preparation until a pH of 3 was reached ( 20 , 21 ) . Proaerolysin was purified from culture supernatant of Aeromonas salmonicida as described previously ( 47 ) . Cell Culture Methods— HeLa cells were grown in Eagle’s medium containing 10 % fetal bovine serum , and CHO cells were grown in Ham’s F - 12 medium containing 10 % fetal bovine serum . Mutant CHO - LA1 cells ( defective in production of GPI - anchored proteins ) and mutant cells recomplemented with the PIG - L gene ( i . e . with restored capacity for production of GPI - anchored proteins , hereafter designated as wild - type CHO cells ) have been described previously ( 48 ) . In assays to test VacA - induced vacuolation of cells , the tissue culture medium was sup - plemented with 5 m M ammonium chloride ( 49 , 50 ) , and VacA was acid - activated as described above . Acid - activated VacA then was di - luted in neutral pH tissue culture medium and was added directly to the neutral pH medium overlying cells . Preparation of a VacA Affinity Column— Purified VacA ( (cid:1) 1 . 2 mg ) from H . pylori 60190 ( in 25 m M HEPES buffer , pH 7 . 2 , containing 150 m M sodium chloride ) was incubated with 1 ml of a 1 : 1 mixture of Affi - Gel 10 : Affi - Gel 15 ( Bio - Rad ) at 4 °C for 4 h , followed by addition of 200 (cid:1) l of 0 . 5 M ethanolamine . This preparation then was loaded onto a 2 - ml Poly - prep column ( Bio - Rad ) , and the column was sequentially washed with 10 m M potassium phosphate buffer ( pH 7 . 2 ) containing 150 m M sodium chloride and 0 . 02 % sodium azide , with 20 m M Tris ( pH 8 . 0 ) containing 500 m M sodium chloride , with 100 m M glycine ( pH 2 . 5 ) , with 50 m M Tris ( pH 8 . 8 ) , with 100 m M ammonium hydroxide ( pH 11 . 5 ) , and finally with 10 m M potassium phosphate buffer ( pH 7 . 2 ) containing 150 m M sodium chloride and 0 . 02 % sodium azide . Preparation of Affinity - purified anti - VacA Rabbit Serum— Anti - VacA rabbit serum 958 ( about 1 ml ) , prepared by immunizing with purified oligomeric VacA from H . pylori strain 60190 , was passed over CM Affi - Gel Blue ( Bio - Rad ) to remove albumin , according to the manufac - turer’s instructions . The immunoglobulin fraction was concentrated by precipitation with ammonium sulfate and resuspended in 10 ml of 10 m M potassium phosphate buffer ( pH 7 . 2 ) containing 150 m M sodium chloride and 0 . 02 % sodium azide . The de - albuminated serum was then applied three times to the VacA affinity column described above . The column was washed two times with 5 column volumes of 10 m M potas - sium phosphate buffer ( pH 7 . 2 ) containing 150 m M sodium chloride and 0 . 02 % sodium azide and then washed two times with 5 column volumes of 20 m M Tris ( pH 8 . 0 ) containing 500 m M sodium chloride . Bound immunoglobulin was eluted with ten 0 . 5 - ml aliquots of 100 m M glycine ( pH 2 . 5 ) and collected into 100 (cid:1) l of 1 M Tris ( pH 8 . 0 ) containing 2 . 5 mg / ml ovalbumin . Aliquots were tested for anti - VacA immunoreactivity by immunoblotting , and the reactive aliquots were pooled . EDTA ( 10 m M ) and sodium azide ( 0 . 02 % ) were added to the reactive aliquots to facilitate storage . Residual nonspecific reactivity in the serum was removed by adsorbing the affinity - purified serum against an Affi - Gel column ( prepared as described above ) containing both H . pylori proteins ( from a vacA null mutant strain ) and HeLa cell proteins . The purified serum was concentrated to a volume of 2 ml in a Centricon - 30 device , diluted 1 : 2 with glycerol , and stored at either 4 °C or (cid:2) 20 °C . Detergent Extraction and Sucrose Density Gradient Centrifugation of Triton X - 100 - insoluble Cell Components— HeLa or CHO cells were grown to confluence in 75 - mm plastic dishes , using Eagle’s medium containing 10 % fetal bovine serum or Ham’s F - 12 medium containing 10 % fetal bovine serum , respectively . Cells were washed three times with 0 . 9 % NaCl to remove serum , and serum - free Eagle’s containing 1 mg / ml ovalbumin then was added to cells . Approximately 1 – 2 (cid:3) 10 7 cells then were incubated for 1 h at 25 °C with 10 (cid:1) g / ml H . pylori VacA . Triton - insoluble cell components were then isolated according to previ - ously published protocols ( 51 ) . In brief , cells were washed twice with 0 . 9 % NaCl and once with Tris - buffered saline ( pH 7 . 4 ) ( TBS ) to remove unbound toxin and then were lysed at 4 °C in 2 ml of TBS ( pH 7 . 4 ) containing 1 % Triton X - 100 , 1 m M EDTA , 0 . 5 m M phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride , and a eukaryotic cell protease inhibitor mixture ( Sigma ) . The lysate was Dounce - homogenized ( 10 strokes ) and incubated for 30 min on ice . An equal volume of 80 % w / v sucrose in TBS was added to 2 ml of lysate . This was overlayered on a 0 . 35 ml of 80 % sucrose cushion . The 40 % sucrose - containing lysate was successively overlayered with 4 ml of 30 % ( w / v ) sucrose in TBS and 4 . 2 ml of 5 % ( w / v ) sucrose in TBS . Samples were centrifuged for 21 h at 208 , 000 (cid:3) g at 4 °C in a Beckman SW 41 TI rotor . Afterward , 1 - ml fractions were collected from the top of the gradient ( fraction 1 ) to the bottom ( fraction 12 ) . Pelleted material recovered from the bottom of the tube was resuspended in fraction 12 . Fractions were stored frozen at (cid:2) 20 °C prior to further analysis . Analysis of Sucrose Density Gradient Fractions— Equal volumes of sucrose density gradient fractions ( 45 (cid:1) l ) were analyzed by SDS - PAGE and immunoblotting . Gradient fractions 1 and 2 , 9 and 10 , and 11 and 12 were routinely pooled ( as lanes a , h , and i , respectively , in Figs . 3 – 5 ) to permit immunoblot analysis of all gradient fractions on a single polyacrylamide gel . The transferrin receptor was detected in gradient fractions by using a mouse anti - human transferrin receptor antibody ( Zymed Laboratories Inc . ) . VacA was detected by using the affinity - purified rabbit polyclonal anti - VacA antibody preparation described above . CD55 was detected using rabbit anti - human CD55 affinity - purified antibody ( Research Diagnostics Inc . ) . Immunoblot analyses were performed using enhanced chemiluminescence ( Amersham Bio - sciences ) with horseradish peroxidase - conjugated secondary antibodies according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Alkaline phosphatase activity was detected by mixing equal volumes of gradient fractions with a solution of p - nitrophenyl phosphate ( 2 mg / ml ) in 0 . 1 M Tris - Cl ( pH 9 . 5 ) , 0 . 1 M NaCl , 5 m M MgCl 2 . After incubation at 37 °C for 10 min , the optical density of samples was analyzed at 410 nm . Triplicate reactions were performed for each gradient fraction . Immunofluorescence Microscopy— HeLa or CHO cells were grown to near confluence on glass coverslips . Cells were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C with purified VacA ( either acid - activated or untreated ) in tissue 1 The abbreviations used are : GPI , glycosylphosphatidylinositol ; PI - PLC , phosphatidylinositol - specific phospholipase C ; CHO , Chinese hamster ovary ; TBS , Tris - buffered saline ; PBS , phosphate - buffered sa - line ; BSA , bovine serum albumin ; DRM , detergent - resistant membrane .

The cells then were washed with PBS containing 3 % bovine serum albumin ( PBS - BSA ) , fixed with 3 . 7 % formaldehyde for 5 min , and permeabilized with 100 % methanol for 2 min . The fixed , permeabilized cells were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with affinity - purified anti - VacA rabbit serum ( diluted 1 : 5000 in PBS - BSA ) and after washing were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with Cy3 - conjugated anti - rabbit im - munoglobulin G ( Sigma ) diluted 1 : 250 in PBS - BSA ( 27 ) . Alternatively , in some experiments VacA was detected using anti - VacA monoclonal antibody 5E4 ( 52 ) , followed by Cy3 - conjugated anti - mouse immunoglob - ulin G ( Sigma ) . Coverslips were mounted on slides in Aqua - Polymount ( Polysciences ) , and the cells were visualized with a Zeiss 410 laser scanning confocal microscope ( 27 ) . Depletion of Cellular Cholesterol by Methyl - (cid:2) - cyclodextrin— HeLa cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in serum - free Eagle’s medium containing 4 m M methyl - (cid:2) - cyclodextrin ( Sigma ) prior to addition of VacA . Control experiments were performed using methyl - (cid:2) - cyclodex - trin - cholesterol complex ( 27 mg of cholesterol per gram methyl - (cid:2) - cyclo - dextrin ) , prepared as described ( 53 , 54 ) . The cholesterol content of cells was measured using either thin layer chromatography ( 48 ) or an Infin - ity cholesterol reagent kit ( Sigma ) . Analysis of Membrane Potential— Analyses of membrane potential were performed as described by Szabo et al . ( 24 ) , with several modifi - cations . Briefly , HeLa cells were pretreated with 4 m M methyl - (cid:2) - cyclo - dextrin at 37 °C for 30 min or left untreated , washed with 0 . 9 % NaCl , and then detached with trypsin / EDTA . Cells were washed with 0 . 9 % NaCl containing 13 m M D - glucose and resuspended in 140 m M NaCl , 5 m M KCl , 1 m M MgCl 2 , 1 m M CaCl 2 , 13 m M D - glucose , 20 m M HEPES buffer ( pH 7 . 4 ) at 1 – 3 (cid:3) 10 6 cells / ml . Cells were then incubated with bis - ( 3 - propyl - 5 - oxoisoxazol - 4 - yl ) pentamethine oxonol ( oxonol VI ) ( Mo - lecular Probes ) ( final concentration 2 . 5 (cid:1) M ) for 15 min at 37 °C . A cell suspension ( 2 ml ) was placed in a stirred quartz cuvette at 37 °C in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50B fluorimeter . After stabilization of the fluorescence signal ( excitation 585 nm , slit 10 nm ; emission , 645 nm , slit 5 nm ) , either an acidified buffer control , acid - activated VacA ( final concentration 5 (cid:1) g / ml ) , or non - activated VacA ( 5 (cid:1) g / ml ) was added to the cells . Further depolarization was induced by addition of gramicidin A ( 20 (cid:1) g / ml ) . RESULTS Analysis of the Role of GPI - anchored Proteins in VacA Cyto - toxicity— A recent study reported that VacA cytotoxicity for HEp - 2 and HeLa cells was inhibited by treatment of the cells with PI - PLC , an enzyme that cleaves GPI - anchored proteins from the cell surface ( 31 ) . Based on this result , it was proposed that the high sensitivity of some cell types to VacA may be dependent on the presence of intact GPI - anchored proteins . To investigate further whether VacA cytotoxic activity requires the presence of GPI - anchored proteins , we analyzed the inter - actions of VacA with CHO - LA1 cells , which are defective in production of GPI - anchored proteins . A previous study has shown these cells are deficient in production of an enzyme encoded by the PIG - L gene that is responsible for the N - deacetylation of N - acetylglucosamine phosphatidylinositol , which is the second step in GPI biosynthesis ( 48 ) . For compar - ison , we examined mutant CHO cells recomplemented with the PIG - L gene ( i . e . with restored capacity for production of GPI - anchored proteins ) ( 48 ) , hereafter designated as wild - type CHO cells . VacA was purified from the culture supernatant of H . pylori 60190 , and then both cell types were incubated for 18 h at 37 °C with varying concentrations of acid - activated VacA , ranging from 5 to 100 (cid:1) g / ml . In agreement with previous stud - ies , the minimum concentration of VacA required to induce vacuolation in (cid:4) 50 % of CHO cells was about 10 - fold higher than that required to induce similar vacuolation of HeLa cells ( 31 , 55 , 56 ) . Importantly , wild - type CHO cells and CHO - LA1 mutant cells did not differ substantially in susceptibility to VacA cytotoxicity ( Fig . 1 ) . As a control , we compared the sus - ceptibility of wild - type CHO cells and CHO - LA1 cells to the toxicity of aerolysin ( a bacterial pore - forming toxin that binds to GPI - anchored proteins ) ( 48 , 57 ) . As expected , wild - type CHO cells were highly susceptible to the toxicity of aerolysin , whereas the mutant CHO cells were resistant to aerolysin toxicity ( Fig . 1 ) . To examine possible internalization of VacA by wild - type CHO and CHO - LA1 cells , these cells types were incubated with acid - activated VacA for 4 h at 37 °C , and inter - nalized toxin then was detected by indirect immunofluores - cence and confocal microscopy . Acid - activated VacA was inter - nalized to a similar extent by wild - type CHO and CHO - LA1 mutant cells , and no differences in the intracellular distribu - tion of VacA were detectable in these two cell types ( Fig . 2 ) . Thus , in CHO cells , interaction of VacA with GPI - anchored proteins is not required for either internalization of the toxin or vacuolating cytotoxic effects . Interaction of VacA with Detergent - resistant Membrane Mi - crodomains— Despite the lack of a requirement of GPI - an - chored proteins for VacA cytotoxicity or VacA internalization , we nevertheless investigated whether VacA was able to asso - ciate with lipid rafts and whether such an association might be important for VacA cytotoxicity . Lipid rafts are membrane microdomains that are enriched in cholesterol , sphingolipids , and various membrane proteins , including GPI - anchored pro - teins . Notable characteristics of these membrane microdo - mains are insolubility at 4 °C in the presence of certain non - ionic detergents and a low buoyant density ( 36 – 39 ) . To determine whether or not H . pylori VacA interacts with deter - gent - resistant membranes ( DRMs ) , HeLa cells were incubated with purified acid - activated VacA for 1 h at room temperature ( 25 °C ) . The cells then were lysed , and Triton - insoluble cell components were separated by sucrose density gradient cen - trifugation , as described under “Materials and Methods . ” As expected , the transferrin receptor was detected almost exclu - sively in fractions at the bottom of the gradient ( Fig . 3 A ) . In contrast , most of the cell - associated VacA was found in low density fractions ( Fig . 3 B , lanes c and d ) . Similar results were obtained if VacA was incubated with HeLa cells at 4 °C instead of 25 °C , to prevent possible internalization of the toxin ( data not shown ) . The low density fractions that contained VacA were enriched in alkaline phosphatase and CD55 , two GPI - anchored proteins known to be constituents of lipid rafts ( Fig . 3 D and data not shown ) . When cell lysates were treated with the combination of 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 plus 0 . 5 % saponin ( in - stead of Triton X - 100 alone ) and then analyzed by sucrose density gradient centrifugation , VacA was not detected in low F IG . 1 . Cytotoxic effects of aerolysin and VacA for wild - type CHO cells and CHO - LA1 mutant cells . Wild - type CHO cells and CHO - LA1 mutant cells were incubated with proaerolysin ( 150 ng / ml ) or with purified acid - activated VacA ( 25 (cid:1) g / ml ) in the presence of 5 m M ammonium chloride for 18 h at 37 °C . The cells then were fixed with formaldehyde , stained with crystal violet , and visualized by light mi - croscopy . As expected , wild - type cells were susceptible to aerolysin toxicity , whereas CHO - LA1 cells were resistant . Both cell types were susceptible to the vacuolating cytotoxic activity of VacA . H . pylori VacA and Lipid Rafts 34644 density fractions , but instead was detected predominantly in fractions at the bottom of the gradient ( Fig . 3 C ) . Similarly , under these conditions alkaline phosphatase activity was not detected in low density fractions , but was detected exclusively in fractions at the bottom of the gradient ( Fig . 3 D ) . These results are consistent with the known capacity of saponin to disrupt lipid rafts ( 51 ) . As expected , when VacA was analyzed directly on gradients ( i . e . without first being incubated with eukaryotic cells ) , all of the toxin was found at the bottom of the gradient ( data not shown ) . In parallel studies , we analyzed interactions of VacA with DRMs of CHO cells and observed that acid - activated VacA associated with DRMs of both wild - type CHO cells and CHO - LA1 mutant cells ( Fig . 4 ) . In sum - mary , these data show that VacA associates with DRMs of the plasma membrane and indicate that GPI - anchored proteins are not required for association of the toxin with DRMs . Acid Activation of Purified VacA Increases Its Association with DRMs— Multiple previous studies ( 20 – 22 ) have shown that VacA purified from H . pylori broth culture supernatants has very little cytotoxic activity for cells unless the toxin is first exposed to low pH or high pH conditions prior to contacting the cells ( a process known as “acid activation” or “alkaline activa - tion” ) . Experiments using 125 I - labeled VacA have shown that both acid - activated and non - activated forms of the toxin can bind to HeLa cells at 4 °C , but acid - activated VacA is internal - ized by cells to a significantly greater extent than non - activated toxin ( 20 ) . In agreement with these results , analysis of the binding of the non - labeled VacA to cells at 4 °C by immuno - blotting confirmed that both acid - activated and non - activated forms of the toxin can bind to cells , although the acid - activated form bound to a somewhat greater extent than the non - acti - vated form ( Fig . 5 A ) . Confocal microscopy studies indicated that when acid - activated VacA ( 1 (cid:1) g / ml ) was incubated with HeLa cells for 4 h at 37 °C , it was internalized and localized in a focal punctate distribution within the cells ( Fig . 5 B ) . In con - trast , when non - activated VacA ( 1 (cid:1) g / ml ) was incubated with cells under the same conditions , it was not detected in such a distribution ( Fig . 5 C ) . When cells were incubated with a 10 - fold higher concentration of non - activated VacA ( 10 (cid:1) g / ml ) , a small proportion of cells demonstrated a detectable signal , but in most cells VacA was again not detected in a focal punctate distribution ( data not shown ) . Based on this evidence that acid - activated VacA and non - F IG . 2 . Internalization of VacA by wild - type CHO and CHO - LA1 cells . Wild - type CHO cells and CHO - LA1 cells were incubated with acid - activated VacA ( 1 (cid:1) g / ml ) for 4 h at 37 °C . The cells were fixed and permeabilized , and the localization of VacA then was detected by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy using a monoclonal anti - VacA antibody . VacA was localized in a punctate pattern within the wild - type cells ( A ) . The intracellular localization of VacA in the mutant cells ( B ) was indistinguishable from that in the wild - type CHO cells . F IG . 3 . Interaction of VacA with lipid rafts . Acid - activated VacA from H . pylori 60190 was incubated with HeLa cells for 1 h at room temperature ( 25 °C ) . Cells were lysed with 1 % Triton X - 100 , and insol - uble cell components then were separated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation . The gradient fractions were analyzed by immunoblot - ting with either anti - transferrin receptor antibodies ( A ) or anti - VacA serum ( B ) . The transferrin receptor was present in fractions at the bottom of the gradient ( A , lanes h and i ) , whereas in contrast , a sub - stantial proportion of the 88 - kDa VacA band was present in low density fractions ( B , lanes c and d ) . When VacA - treated cells were lysed in a mixture of 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 plus 0 . 5 % saponin and insoluble cell components then were analyzed , VacA was detected predominantly in fractions at the bottom of the gradient ( C ) . Alkaline phosphatase activ - ity was detected in low density fractions from cells treated with Triton X - 100 , but not in low density fractions ( lanes c and d ) from cells treated with the combination of saponin plus Triton X - 100 ( D ) . F IG . 4 . Interaction of VacA with lipid rafts in wild - type CHO cells and CHO - LA1 mutant cells . Acid - activated VacA was incubated with wild - type CHO cells and with CHO - LA1 cells ( defective in produc - tion of GPI - anchored proteins ) for 1 . 5 h at 25 °C . After lysing the cells , Triton - insoluble fractions were analyzed by sucrose gradient centrifu - gation and immunoblotting of fractions with anti - VacA serum . VacA was detected in low density fractions prepared from both wild - type CHO cells ( A ) and CHO - LA1 mutant cells ( B ) . H . pylori VacA and Lipid Rafts 34645 activated VacA interact differently with cells , we hypothesized that these two forms of the toxin might interact differently with lipid rafts . To determine whether interaction of VacA with lipid rafts requires activation of the toxin , VacA was either acid - activated or left untreated and then added directly to the neu - tral pH medium overlying HeLa cells . Cells were incubated with VacA for 1 h at 25 °C . The association of VacA with DRMs was then analyzed , as described above . Acid - activated VacA was found in the low density gradient fractions corresponding to DRMs ( Fig . 5 D ) , whereas non - activated VacA was found almost exclusively at the bottom of the gradient ( Fig . 5 E ) . Similar results were obtained if acid - activated VacA and non - activated VacA were incubated with cells at 4 °C instead of room temperature ( data not shown ) . Thus , acid activation of the purified toxin resulted in a marked increase in its associ - ation with DRMs . Because acid activation markedly enhances the cytotoxic activity of purified VacA , the foregoing observa - tion suggested that VacA association with DRMs might be an important feature of the intoxication process . Inhibitory Effects of Methyl - (cid:2) - cyclodextrin on VacA Cytotox - icity— To investigate further the role of lipid rafts in the proc - ess by which VacA intoxicates cells , we examined the effects of methyl - (cid:2) - cyclodextrin , an agent known to disrupt lipid rafts by extracting cholesterol from membranes ( 44 ) . In preliminary experiments , we found that lipid rafts were more effectively disrupted by treatment of intact cells with high concentrations ( (cid:3) 10 m M ) of methyl - (cid:2) - cyclodextrin than by treatment with lower concentrations of the drug , based on the distribution of alkaline phosphatase activity in gradient fractions prepared from Triton - insoluble membranes . However , treatment of in - tact HeLa cells with (cid:3) 10 m M methyl - (cid:2) - cyclodextrin resulted in marked alterations in cell morphology , whereas lower concen - trations of methyl - (cid:2) - cyclodextrin ( (cid:4) 4 m M ) did not . Therefore , subsequent experiments were performed using a methyl - (cid:2) - cyclodextrin concentration of 4 m M . The total cholesterol con - tent of cells treated with 4 m M methyl - (cid:2) - cyclodextrin at 37 °C for 30 min was 77 (cid:5) 2 % of that in untreated cells . HeLa cells were pretreated with 4 m M methyl - (cid:2) - cyclodextrin in serum - free medium for 30 min and then were incubated with acid - activated VacA . VacA induced marked vacuolation in con - trol ( untreated ) cells , but in contrast , no vacuoles were detected when VacA was added to cells that had been pretreated with methyl - (cid:2) - cyclodextrin ( Fig . 6 , A – C ) . To test whether the ob - served inhibitory effects resulted specifically from cholesterol depletion rather than from direct inhibitory effects of methyl - (cid:2) - cyclodextrin , cells were pretreated with 2 m M methyl - (cid:2) - cy - clodextrin plus 2 m M methyl - (cid:2) - cyclodextrin - cholesterol com - plex , as described by Thiele et al . ( 53 ) , prior to addition of acid - activated VacA . Thus , in this control experiment , the cells were exposed to 4 m M methyl - (cid:2) - cyclodextrin , but there was no depletion of cellular cholesterol content ( data not shown ) . Un - der these conditions , VacA induced prominent cell vacuolation ( Fig . 6 D ) . Additional control experiments were done in which cholesterol was depleted by incubating cells with 4 m M methyl - (cid:2) - cyclodextrin for 30 min , and then methyl - (cid:2) - cholesterol was removed and cells were incubated with 5 m M methyl - (cid:2) - cyclo - dextrin - cholesterol complex . Analysis of cellular cholesterol content confirmed that this procedure effectively restored cho - lesterol to its original levels . When added to cells manipulated as described above , VacA induced prominent cell vacuolation ( Fig . 6 E ) . These experiments indicate that depletion of cellular cholesterol renders cells resistant to the vacuolating activity of VacA . In parallel experiments , we analyzed the effects of methyl - (cid:2) - cyclodextrin on the association of VacA with cells . In cells pretreated with methyl - (cid:2) - cyclodextrin , the total amount of cell - associated VacA was detectably reduced compared with the amount of cell - associated VacA in untreated cells ( Fig . 7 A ) . Next , DRMs were prepared from VacA - treated cells that had been either pretreated or not pretreated with methyl - (cid:2) - cyclo - dextrin . A reduction in alkaline phosphatase activity in low density fractions indicated that DRMs were partially disrupted by methyl - (cid:2) - cyclodextrin treatment ( Fig . 7 B ) . Also , the amount of VacA detected in low density fractions was reduced , but not completely eliminated , by methyl - (cid:2) - cyclodextrin treatment ( Fig . 7 C ) . These results are consistent with the existence of heterogeneity among DRMs ( 58 ) , such that certain types of DRMs may be differentially affected by cholesterol depletion . Additional experiments were done to investigate further the mechanism by which methyl - (cid:2) - cyclodextrin inhibits VacA cy - totoxicity . VacA is known to form anion - selective channels in the plasma membrane of HeLa cells , and the formation of these channels results in partial depolarization of the resting mem - brane potential ( 24 ) . To determine whether methyl - (cid:2) - cyclodex - trin pretreatment of cells inhibited the capacity of VacA to induce depolarization of the plasma membrane , we used bis - ( 3 - propyl - 5 - oxoisoxazol - 4 - yl ) pentamethine oxonol as a probe to monitor the membrane potential of HeLa cells . Consistent with previously published results ( 24 ) , we found that following the addition of acid - activated VacA , the resting membrane poten - tial of HeLa cells was rapidly altered ( Fig . 8 A ) . Following depolarization of the membrane by VacA , further depolariza - F IG . 5 . Acid activation of VacA enhances its localization in lipid rafts . A , purified VacA was either acid - activated or left untreated and then incubated with HeLa cells at 4 °C for 1 h . Analysis of total cell lysates by immunoblotting with anti - VacA serum indicated that both forms of the toxin bound to cells and that the total binding of acid - activated VacA to cells was greater than that of non - activated VacA . B and C , HeLa cells were incubated with either acid - activated VacA ( 1 (cid:1) g / ml ) or non - activated VacA ( 1 (cid:1) g / ml ) for 4 h at 37 °C . The cells were fixed and permeabilized , and the localization of VacA then was detected by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy , using affinity - purified rab - bit anti - VacA serum . Acid - activated VacA was localized in a focal punc - tate pattern within the cells ( B ) , whereas this pattern of localization was not detected in cells treated with non - activated VacA ( C ) . D and E , Triton - insoluble cell components were separated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation , and gradient fractions were analyzed by im - munoblotting with anti - VacA serum . Acid - activated VacA was detected in low density gradient fractions ( D ) , whereas non - activated VacA was detected predominantly in fractions at the bottom of the gradient ( E ) . H . pylori VacA and Lipid Rafts 34646 tion could be induced by addition of gramicidin A ( 20 (cid:1) g / ml ) ( data not shown ) . Addition of non - activated VacA or an acidi - fied buffer control to the cells did not result in any detectable alterations of the membrane potential ( Fig . 8 A and data not shown ) . Interestingly , treatment with methyl - (cid:2) - cyclodextrin had no effect on the membrane depolarization induced by acid - activated VacA ( Fig . 8 A ) . These results indicate that treatment of the cells with methyl - (cid:2) - cyclodextrin does not interfere with the capacity of VacA to form channels in the plasma membrane . Since methyl - (cid:2) - cyclodextrin treatment inhibited VacA - in - duced vacuolation but not channel formation by VacA at the plasma membrane , we hypothesized that internalization or trafficking of the toxin might be altered in cholesterol - depleted cells . We therefore assessed the localization of VacA in methyl - (cid:2) - cyclodextrin - treated cells . Whereas VacA was detected in an intracellular focal punctate distribution in untreated cells , only a diffuse distribution could be seen in cyclodextrin - treated cells ( Fig . 8 B ) , even when using a 10 - fold higher concentration of acid - activated VacA ( data not shown ) . To determine whether the altered distribution of VacA resulted from cholesterol de - pletion or from direct effects of the methyl - (cid:2) - cyclodextrin , con - trol experiments were performed in which cells were incubated with the same dose of cyclodextrin in the presence of excess cholesterol . Under these conditions , VacA localized in an intra - cellular focal punctate distribution ( Fig . 8 B ) . Similarly , if cel - lular cholesterol was depleted and subsequently replaced , VacA localized in the same intracellular focal punctate distri - bution ( data not shown ) . These results indicate that cholesterol depletion induced by methyl - (cid:2) - cyclodextrin disrupts the cellu - lar processes normally utilized for internalization or intracel - lular trafficking of VacA . In agreement with a previous report ( 31 ) , we found that treatment of cells with nystatin also inhibited VacA - induced vacuolation ( Fig . 9 A ) . Nystatin binds to cholesterol but does not deplete cellular cholesterol levels , and therefore , as expected , the cholesterol content of nystatin - treated cells was not differ - ent compared with that of untreated cells . Treatment of cells with nystatin produced fairly modest effects on raft integrity and VacA association with rafts ( data not shown ) , similar to the F IG . 6 . Inhibitory effects of methyl - (cid:1) - cyclodextrin on VacA - induced cell vacuolation . HeLa cells were pretreated as described below , incubated with acid - activated VacA ( 5 (cid:1) g / ml ) for 2 h at 37 °C , stained with crystal violet , and then visualized by microscopy ( magni - fication (cid:3) 40 ) .

F IG . 7 . Effects of methyl - (cid:1) - cyclodextrin on VacA interactions with cells . A , HeLa cells were either pretreated with 4 m M methyl - (cid:2) - cyclodextrin or left untreated as a control and then were incubated with acid - activated VacA for 4 h at 37 °C . Cells lysates then were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti - VacA serum . B and C , HeLa cells were either pretreated with 4 m M methyl - (cid:2) - cyclodextrin or left untreated and then were incubated with acid - activated VacA for 1 h at 25 °C . Triton - insoluble cell components were separated by sucrose density centrifu - gation , and the alkaline phosphatase activity in fractions was quanti - fied ( B ) . Gradient fractions were analyzed for the presence of VacA by immunoblotting with anti - VacA serum ( C ) . H . pylori VacA and Lipid Rafts 34647 results observed following treatment with 4 m M methyl - (cid:2) - cy - clodextrin ( Fig . 7 ) . However , treatment of cells with nystatin interfered with the internalization or intracellular localization of VacA ( Fig . 9 B ) . Thus , binding of nystatin to cellular choles - terol produced essentially the same effects on VacA activity and localization as those that were observed following deple - tion of cellular cholesterol . DISCUSSION Binding of bacterial protein toxins to eukaryotic cells often is mediated by an interaction of the toxin with a specific receptor on the cell surface . Several previous studies have provided evidence for saturability and specificity of VacA binding to cells ( 59 – 61 ) . In contrast , studies with radiolabeled VacA have not demonstrated convincing evidence of a saturable binding proc - ess , and the binding of radiolabeled VacA was only partially inhibited by excess unlabeled VacA ( 20 , 31 ) . At least five dif - ferent putative receptors for VacA have been reported , includ - ing receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase (cid:2) , an unidentified 140 - kDa protein , the epidermal growth factor receptor , hepa - ran sulfate , and various lipids ( 22 , 23 , 62 – 65 ) . It has also been reported that that treatment of cells with either nystatin or PI - PLC inhibits VacA cytotoxicity , and based on this observa - tion , it was proposed that intact lipid rafts and GPI - anchored proteins are required for VacA susceptibility ( 31 ) . Thus , at present , there is considerable confusion about which cell sur - face components are most relevant for VacA binding and cyto - toxicity . It remains unclear whether VacA cytotoxicity is de - pendent on binding of VacA to one specific receptor or whether cytotoxicity results from nonspecific binding of VacA to multi - ple cell - surface components . Several different bacterial protein toxins seem to utilize lipid rafts or raft - associated GPI - anchored proteins to intoxicate cells . Two pore - forming toxins , aerolysin and Clostridium sep - ticum alpha toxin , each bind to GPI - anchored proteins , which are enriched in lipid raft microdomains of the plasma mem - brane ( 57 , 66 ) . Other pore - forming toxins , such as perfringoly - sin , bind to cholesterol components of lipid rafts ( 43 ) . It has been proposed that lipid rafts serve as concentrating platforms to promote oligomerization of these toxins on the cell surface , a process that is required for membrane channel formation ( 57 ) . Two toxins with intracellular enzymatic activity , cholera toxin and tetanus toxin , bind to GM1 and a specific GPI - anchored protein , respectively , which are enriched in lipid raft microdo - F IG . 8 . Effects of methyl - (cid:1) - cyclodextrin pretreatment on VacA - induced alterations in membrane potential and VacA localiza - tion within cells . A , HeLa cells were pretreated with 4 m M methyl - (cid:2) - cyclodextrin or left untreated and then were loaded with oxonol VI ( a probe used to monitor membrane potential ) . Following addition of acid - activated VacA ( 5 (cid:1) g / ml ) , the resting membrane potential of both con - trol ( open square ) and cyclodextrin - treated cells ( filled square ) was rapidly altered and reached a plateau within 2 – 3 min . Addition of non - activated VacA ( 5 (cid:1) g / ml ) ( filled circle ) or acidified buffer control ( data not shown ) did not induce any alteration in the membrane poten - tial . B , HeLa cells were pretreated as described below and then incu - bated with acid - activated VacA for 4 h at 37 °C . The localization of VacA was assessed by indirect immunofluorescence methodology and confocal microscopy , using a monoclonal anti - VacA antibody . Top left panel , no pretreatment and no addition of VacA . Top right panel , no pretreat - ment , followed by addition of VacA . Bottom left panel , pretreatment with 4 m M methyl - (cid:2) - cyclodextrin for 30 min prior to addition of VacA . Bottom right panel , pretreatment with 2 m M methyl - (cid:2) - cyclodextrin plus 2 m M methyl - (cid:2) - cyclodextrin - cholesterol complex for 30 min prior to addition of VacA . F IG . 9 . Inhibitory effects of nystatin on VacA - induced cell vac - uolation . HeLa cells were either pretreated with nystatin ( 40 (cid:1) g / ml ) for 1 h at 37 °C or not pretreated and then incubated with acid - acti - vated VacA ( 5 (cid:1) g / ml ) at 37 °C . A , cells were fixed and stained with crystal violet . Addition of VacA induced vacuolation in untreated cells ( left panel ) , but not in cells pretreated with nystatin ( right panel ) . B , the localization of VacA was assessed by indirect immunofluorescence methodology and confocal microscopy , using a monoclonal anti - VacA antibody . VacA was localized in a focal punctate intracellular distribu - tion in untreated cells ( left panel ) , but not in cells that had been pretreated with nystatin ( right panel ) . H . pylori VacA and Lipid Rafts 34648 mains ( 43 – 45 , 58 , 67 ) . It has been proposed that lipid rafts play an important role in the internalization and intracellular traf - ficking of these toxins ( 44 , 58 , 67 ) . The conclusion that these bacterial protein toxins require lipid rafts for intoxication of cells has been based mainly on experiments that utilize cyclo - dextrin or other cholesterol - interacting drugs to alter lipid rafts . In the current study , we provide direct biochemical evidence indicating that VacA associates with lipid rafts . Moreover , we find that VacA is still able to associate with lipid rafts , undergo internalization , and induce cytotoxic effects in the absence of GPI - anchored proteins . Although our conclusions about VacA interactions with GPI - anchored proteins in CHO cells are un - equivocal , these data do not completely exclude the possibility that GPI - anchored proteins might contribute to the high sen - sitivity of various other cell types to VacA cytotoxicity . Notably , a previous report found that doses of PI - PLC sufficient to block VacA activity in HEp - 2 cells had no significant effect on 125 I - VacA binding to these cells ( 31 ) . This result is consistent with the concept that there may be multiple binding sites and / or multiple internalization pathways by which VacA intoxicates cells ( 31 ) . We speculate that the inhibitory effect seen with PI - PLC could be due to changes in raft properties that occur when GPI - anchored proteins are acutely removed by the enzy - matic treatment . In contrast , GPI - deficient cells grow continu - ously in the absence of GPI - anchored proteins and therefore are perhaps able to compensate for this defect . In agreement with a previous report ( 31 ) , we found in the current study that treatment of cells with nystatin inhibits the activity of VacA . Our demonstration that acid - activated ( ac - tive ) forms of VacA associate with lipid rafts , whereas non - activated ( inactive ) forms do not , provides further evidence suggesting that interaction of VacA with lipid rafts is required for cytotoxicity . Finally , we found that treatment of cells with methyl - (cid:2) - cyclodextrin , a cholesterol - depleting agent known to disrupt rafts , inhibits VacA cytotoxicity . Interestingly , the doses of cholesterol - interacting drugs used in this study re - sulted in nearly complete inhibition of VacA - induced cell vac - uolation , but only partially disrupted DRMs and incompletely inhibited VacA association with DRMs . Moreover , methyl - (cid:2) - cyclodextrin did not inhibit the capacity of VacA to depolarize the plasma membrane of cells . However , treatment of cells with cholesterol - interacting drugs strongly interfered with either the internalization or intracellular localization of VacA . Thus , it seems likely that early events ( e . g . binding of the toxin to cells ) in the VacA intoxication process are not substantially affected by these compounds but that their inhibitory effects are mainly due to interference with later events ( e . g . internal - ization and intracellular trafficking of VacA ) . This interpreta - tion is consistent with the concept that raft - dependent mecha - nisms are important for intracellular sorting events ( 68 – 71 ) . We speculate that there is heterogeneity among DRMs ( 58 ) and that functional properties of certain types of DRMs relevant for intracellular trafficking processes may be especially suscepti - ble to disruption by drugs such as methyl - (cid:2) - cyclodextrin and nystatin . In future studies , it will be important to investigate further the role of lipid rafts and cellular cholesterol content on the intracellular trafficking of various bacterial protein toxins , viruses , and bacterial pathogens .
