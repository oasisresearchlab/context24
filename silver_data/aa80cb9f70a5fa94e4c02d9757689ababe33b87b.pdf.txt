Although some E2F functions are independent of the Retinoblastoma tumor suppressor ( Rb ) and related family members , p107 and p130 , much of E2F - mediated repression of S phase entry is dependent upon Rb . We previously showed in cultured mouse embryonic ﬁ broblasts that concomitant loss of three E2F activators with overlapping functions ( E2F1 , E2F2 , and E2F3 ) triggered the p53 - p21 Cip1 response and caused cell cycle arrest . Here we report on a dramatic difference in the requirement for E2F during development and in cultured cells byshowingthatcellcycle entryoccurs normally in E2f1 - 3 triply - de ﬁ cient epithelialstemcellsandprogenitors ofthedevelopinglens . Sixteen daysafterbirth , however , massiveapoptosis indifferentiating epithelium leads to a collapse of the entire eye . Prior to this collapse , we ﬁ nd that expression of cell cycle - regulated genes in E2F - de ﬁ cient lenses is aberrantly high . In a second set of experiments , we demonstrate that E2F3 ablation alone does not cause abnormalities in lens development but rescues phenotypic defects caused by loss of Rb , a binding partner of E2F known to recruit histone deacetylases , SWI / SNF and CtBP - polycomb complexes , methyltransferases , and other co - repressors to gene promoters . Together , these data implicate E2F1 - 3 in mediating transcriptional repression by Rb during cell cycle exit and point to a critical role for their repressive functions in cell survival . Published by Elsevier Inc . Introduction Cell cycle entry is guarded by cyclin dependent kinases ( Cdk ) which , upon activation by mitogenic signals , phosphorylate the Retinoblastoma pocket proteins , Rb , p107 , and p130 , and cause the release and accumulation of sequestered E2F transcription factors . E2Fs consist of a family of repressors and activators that together coordinately regulate cellular proliferation by controlling the tran - scriptional activity of over 130 known target genes that function to initiate the G 1 / S transition , DNA synthesis , DNA repair and mitosis ( Bracken et al . , 2004 ) . Rb is thought to inhibit E2F activity and expression of cell cycle - regulated genes by association with co - repressors such as histone deacetylases , SWI / SNF and CtBP - polycomb complexes , histone methyltransferases , and DNA methyltransferases ( Dahiya et al . , 2001 ; Luo et al . , 1998 ; Nielsen et al . , 2001 ; Robertson et al . , 2000 ; Vandel et al . , 2001 ; Zhang et al . , 2000 ) . Classic paradigms of cell cycle regulation have consistently portrayed the three activators , E2F1 , E2F2 , and E2F3 , as the ﬁ nal components of the Cdk - Rb signaling cascade that execute the transcriptional program necessary to commit cells to enter S phase . Although Rb - mediated cell cycle regulation has been studied extensively , the evidence that E2F1 - 3 are required for expression of genes critical for proliferation is based almost exclusively on analyses of lower eukaryotes and in vitro cell culture systems ( Bracken et al . , 2004 ; Hallstrom and Nevins , 2009 ; Morris et al . , 2000 ; Rowland et al . , 2002 ) . Only recently has it been demonstrated that E2F1 - 3 are not essential for cell cycle entry , and that proliferation can proceed without E2F1 - 3 in the majority of cell types present during organ development and embryogenesis ( Chen Developmental Biology 351 ( 2011 ) 35 – 45 ⁎ Corresponding authors .

In fact , there is now good evidence to suggest that these E2Fs are most critical for regulating survival in vivo ( Chen et al . , 2009 ; Chong et al . , 2009 ) . The highly organized cellular architecture of the developing lens makes it an attractive system for the in vivo study of cell cycle and differentiation . Simply based upon spatial separation , epithelial cells that are proliferating can be distinguished easily from those that are exiting the cell cycle and terminally differentiating . At approximately 10 days of murine embryonic development ( E10 ) , morphological lens formation begins with the invagination of the surface ectoderm overlying the optic cup to form the lens pit , which subsequently closes to form the lens vesicle ( Lovicu et al . , 2004 ) . Although initially all epithelial cells lining the lens vesicle maintain the capacity to proliferate , as development progresses , cycling cells are con ﬁ ned to a ring of epithelium slightly anterior to the lens equator . At the equatorial region ( or bow ) of the lens , rapidly proliferating cells move into a transition zone , wherein they begin to exit the cell cycle and differentiate . As these cells migrate toward the cortex of the lens , they terminally differentiate into ﬁ ber cells , losing their nuclei and organelles and gaining the translucent properties necessary for vision . To test whether loss of E2F activators impact cell cycle entry in vivo , we examined the effects of E2F1 , E2F2 , and E2F3 triple de ﬁ ciency during development in murine pre - and post - natal lenses . We ﬁ nd that morphological lens development occurs relatively normally through late gestation , illustrating that E2F activators are unnecessary for proliferation of lens epithelial cells . During migration of the epithelial cells to the equatorial zone , however , DNA double - strand breaks develop , p21 Cip1 is upregulated , and cells exhibit signs of apoptotic cell death . Further , we ﬁ nd a dramatic increase in expression of E2F target genes in E2f - triply de ﬁ cient lenses , pointing to the shared function that E2F1 , 2 , and 3 play in repressing expression of cell cycle genes during maturation of the lens epithelium . Aberrant expression of genes required for cell cycle exit and lens differentiation , along with upregulation of p19 Arf and other E2F target genes , together culminates in collapse of the entire lens architecture between one to two weeks after birth . Importantly , we demonstrate a nearly complete rescue of Rb - de ﬁ ciency phenotypes , including proliferation defects , with conditional ablation of E2F3 , pointing to a context - dependent switch in the function of “ activating ” E2Fs to repress or activate transcription . These data illustrate that E2F - mediated activation of cell cycle regulated genes is not required for proliferation , and point to a critical role for E2F1 - 3 in cell survival and transcriptional repression in vivo . Materials and methods Mouse strains and genotyping E2f1 , E2f2 , E2f3 knockout mice and cry - cre ( MLR10 ) transgenic ( Zhao et al . , 2004 ) and ROSA26 reporter ( Gt ( ROSA ) 26Sor tm1Sor ) ( Soriano , 1999 ) mice were maintained on a mixed 129SvEv ; C57BL / 6 ; FVB background . PCR primers for genotyping are listed in Fig . S1 . Proliferation assays Proliferation of lens epithelial or ﬁ ber cells was measured by incorporation of BrdU . Brie ﬂ y , pregnant dams or pups were injected with BrdU 2 hours prior to harvest at 100 μ g / g body weight . Tissue from embryos or neonates was ﬁ xed in 10 % buffered formalin , dehydrated , and processed with paraf ﬁ n . Sections were cut at 5 - μ m thickness and BrdU was detected by immuno ﬂ uorescent staining . Histology and immuno ﬂ uorescent staining Lens architecture was histologically examined by hematoxylin and eosin staining of lens sections . Proliferation was measured by immunostaining with BrdU - speci ﬁ c antibodies ( DAKO ; Bu20a ) , and apoptosis was detected by TUNEL assays using the Apoptag Plus Peroxidase In Situ Apoptosis Detection Kit ( Chemicon International ) . DNA double - strand breaks were detected as a measure of DNA damage by immuno ﬂ uorescent staining with phospho - histone H2AX ( Ser139 ) antibodies ( Upstate , NY ; clone JBW301 ) . Other antibodies used include PCNA ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , PC10 ) , Mcm3 ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , N - 19 ) , and cleaved caspase - 3 ( Cell Signaling Technology , Asp175 ) . A minimum of three sections from each lens were quanti ﬁ ed by comparison of the number of positive cells to the total number of nuclei in epithelial or ﬁ ber cells . Lens - speci ﬁ c markers of differentiation , including α - , β - , and γ - crystallin antibodies were a gift from Dr . S . Zigler . Detection of β - galactosidase activity Cry - cre mice were crossed to the ROSA26 reporter ( Gt ( ROSA ) 26Sor tm1Sor ) line to test the activity of cre as described previously ( Robinson et al . , 1995 ) . Brie ﬂ y , eyes were surgically removed from embryos , ﬁ xed in 2 % paraformaldehyde in 0 . 1 M phosphate buffer pH 7 . 3 , washed in PBS , and incubated overnight in the dark at room temperature in X - gal staining medium ( 5 mM potassium ferricya - nide , 5 mM potassium ferrocyanide , 1 mg / ml X - gal , 0 . 1 % deoxycho - late , 0 . 2 % Nonidet P - 40 , and 2 mM MgCl 2 in PBS ) . Eyes were post - ﬁ xed the next day in 10 % buffered formalin for 2 hours and processed for paraf ﬁ n embedding , sectioning , and counterstaining with nuclear fast red . Global gene expression analysis Cry - Cre + / − ; E2f1 − / − ; E2f2 − / − ; E2f3 LoxP / LoxP and E2f1 + / + ; E2f2 − / − ; E2f3 LoxP / LoxP lenses were microdissected from the eye at E17 . 5 and P0 with 18 - gauge needles . RNA from both lenses of each embryo or neonate was isolated by TRIzol puri ﬁ cation and processed for hybridization to Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2 . 0 Arrays . Expres - sion values were adjusted by quantile normalization and log transformation with RMAExpress , and data were analyzed with BRB - ArrayTools 3 . 7 . 0 . ( Figs . S2 , S3 ) . Class comparison was used to select genes differentially expressed at a signi ﬁ cance level of p b 0 . 0001 or p b 0 . 001 , and gene set expression comparisons were used to identify gene ontologies and pathways impacted by loss of E2F ( Fig . S4 ) . DAVID ( http : / / david . abcc . ncifcrf . gov ) was used to further evaluate subsets of genes . CBRC TFSearch ( http : / / www . cbrc . jp / research / db / TFSEARCH . html ) and GATHER ( http : / / gather . genome . duke . edu ) aided in the identi ﬁ cation of genes containing E2F consensus binding sites . Microarray data presented in this study has been deposited in the GEO public repository ( GSE16533 ) . Real - time RT - PCR Both lenses from each embryo or neonate were placed in one microcentrifuge tube and homogenized in TRIzol reagent to obtain totalRNA ( LifeTechnologies ) . Five μ goftotalRNAwasusedtogenerate cDNA using Superscript III reverse transcriptase ( Invitrogen ) . Quan - titative RT - PCR was performed using the BioRad iCycler PCR machine . Each PCR reaction contained 0 . 5 μ l of cDNA template , primers at a concentration of 100 nM , and 1 × of SYBR Green Reaction Mix ( BioRad ) . Reactions were performed in triplicate in a total volume of 25 μ l and data were analyzed using the Δ Ct method , where GAPDH served as the internal control . Each PCR reaction generated only the expected amplicon as shown by the melting - temperature pro ﬁ les of the ﬁ nal products and gel electrophoresis . Primer sequences are listed in Fig . S1 . 36 P .

Wenzel et al . / Developmental Biology 351 ( 2011 ) 35 – 45 Results Lens epithelial cells proliferate in the absence of E2F1 - 3 We utilized a well - characterized transgenic mouse that expresses cre in lens epithelial and ﬁ ber cells to delete a conditional allele of E2f3 , either alone or in combination with E2f1 or E2f2 , at the earliest stages of lens vesicle formation ( cry - cre , also known as MLR10 ; Fig . 1A ) ( Zhao et al . , 2004 ) . This analysis showed that the combined deletion of any two of the three activator E2Fs does not adversely affect lens epithelial cell proliferation or lens development ( Fig . S5A ) . To avoid compensation that could result from overlapping functions among E2F members ( Tsai et al . , 2008 ) , the entire E2f1 - 3 subset was deleted . The ef ﬁ cient recombination of the E2f3 LoxP allele was con ﬁ rmed by PCR - genotyping of laser capture microdissected ( LCM ) lens tissue ( Fig . 1B ) . Surprisingly , histological examination of E2f1 - 3 de ﬁ cient ( TKO ) lenses revealed no conspicuous change in lens architecture prior to birth ( Fig . 1C ) . Direct assessment of DNA replication and mitosis by BrdU incorporation and phosphorylated histone H3 ( P - H3 ) , respectively , did not identify signi ﬁ cant differ - ences in proliferation between control and TKO epithelial cells at most stages of lens development ( E13 . 5 - P16 ; Fig . 1D , E ) . Interestingly , we observed a doubling of BrdU incorporation in lens epithelial cells of newborn TKO pups ( P1 , p = 0 . 002 ; Fig . 1E ) and appearance of ectopic DNA synthesis in the associated lens ﬁ ber cells ( 0 . 5 % to 2 % BrdU positive ) , suggesting that cell cycle exit could have been impacted . Perinatal differentiation appeared to be relatively normal , as measured by the expression and distribution of α - , β - , and γ - crystallin proteins in TKO lenses ( Fig . 2A ) ; however , careful inspection of a panel of classical markers of lens differentiation and associated factors by microarray revealed signi ﬁ cant changes in gene expression of a number of genes required for proper lens development ( Fig . 2B ) . At E17 . 5 , a master regulator of eye development , Pax6 , was increased by approximately 1 . 5 - to 2 - fold in TKO lenses ( p b 0 . 001 , Fig . 2B ) . Targeted overexpression of Pax6 in mice causes anomalies in ﬁ ber cell morphology and packing , increases in proteins involved in cell signaling and adhesion , and eventual breakdown of cellular structure ( Duncan et al . , 2000 ) . Mutation of Pax6 in human patients has also been found to be responsible for ocular disorders such as aniridia and cataract ( Cai et al . , 2010 ; Hanson et al . , 1999 ) . Additionally , we found signi ﬁ cant downregulation of a tumor suppressor essential for proper cell cycle exit and ﬁ ber cell differentiation , Prox1 . Prox1 activates Cdk inhibitors , p27 Kip1 and p57 Kip2 , in lens epithelium at the transition zone and its inactivation causes ectopic DNA synthesis and cycling in lens ﬁ ber cells ( Wigle et al . , 1999 ) . Interestingly , both Pax6 and Prox1 have several E2F consensus binding sites upstream of their transcrip - tional start sites . By P0 , many more genes critical for differentiation and cell cycle control were altered in the TKO lens , including Gja1 , Pdgfrl , Cryl1 , Pitx3 , Pdgfra , Gja3 , and Six3 ( p b 0 . 001 ) . In fact , a host of other genes required for proper lens development were consistently altered , most notably genes downstream of Pax6 ( Itgb1 and Pxn ) , Prox1 ( Cdkn1b ( p27 Kip1 ) ) , and others required for proper differenti - ation , ﬁ ber cell elongation , and cell survival , such as Foxe3 , Cdh1 , Maf , and Mafb ( p b 0 . 01 , Fig . 2B ) . Together , these observations illustrate that E2F1 - 3 are not essential for the proliferation of lens epithelial stem cells or progenitors but they may be required for terminal differentiation . Loss of E2F1 - 3 causes DNA double - strand breaks and apoptosis Soon after birth ( P0 ) , TKO lenses exhibited signs of cellular breakdown and hypotrophy within the ﬁ ber compartment ( Figs . 3A , B , S5B ) . After 7 days of development ( P7 ) , TKO lenses had undergone extensive vacuolation , and at just over 2 weeks old ( P16 ) , lenses were clouded , shriveled and approximately one - eighth the size of control lenses ( Fig . 3A – D , S5B ) . Not surprisingly , many of these features Fig . 1 . Conditional deletion of E2f3 in cry - cre ; E2f1 − / − ; E2f2 − / − ; E2f3 LoxP / LoxP lenses does not block epithelial cell proliferation .

Wenzel et al . / Developmental Biology 351 ( 2011 ) 35 – 45 resembled murine models of Pax6 overexpression ( Duncan et al . , 2000 ) . Given the protracted nature of TKO lens breakdown , we examined the integrity of genomic DNA and apoptosis in TKO lenses prior to birth , before the manifestation of these phenotypes . Immunohistochemical staining of E13 . 5 lenses showed a marked increase in cells that stained positive for phosphorylated histone H2AX ( γ - H2AX ) . Positivity for γ - H2AX was particularly acute in newly differentiating ﬁ ber cells at the equatorial plane of the TKO Fig . 2 .

Wenzel et al . / Developmental Biology 351 ( 2011 ) 35 – 45 lenses , whereas γ - H2AX positivity was high in both TKO and control lenses during late stages of ﬁ ber cell differentiation ( Fig . 4A ) . DNA double - strand breaks in terminally differentiating ﬁ ber cells within the lens cortex are presumably a result of normal nuclear degener - ation that must occur for maturation of the translucent ﬁ bers . Apoptotic cell death , as measured by TUNEL and cleaved caspase - 3 immuno ﬂ uorescence , was apparent in the epithelium and ﬁ ber compartments of E13 . 5 TKO lenses but not in control lenses ( Fig . 4B , C , and Fig . S5C ) . At E16 . 5 , apoptosis was most pronounced near the equatorial transition zone of E16 . 5 TKO lenses , consistent with the distribution of γ - H2AX - positive cells ( Fig . 3D ) . As a result , the anterior perimeter of E17 . 5 TKO lens sections contained 36 % fewer epithelial cells than control lenses ( p = 0 . 0002 ; Fig . S5D ) . From these observa - tions , we conclude that postnatal architectural collapse of TKO lenses is accompanied by massive breakdown of genetic material and initiation of an apoptotic program . E2F target gene expression is upregulated with ablation of E2F “ activators ” In order to identify the molecular pathways impacted by loss of E2F1 - 3 in vivo , we compared global gene expression pro ﬁ les in control ( E2f2 − / − ) and TKO lenses at two developmental stages , E17 . 5 and P0 , which precede the physical breakdown of the mutant lens . We implemented unsupervised class comparison analyses of all probesets on the array to identify genes differentially expressed between lenses . We also used an unbiased approach similar to Gene Set Enrichment Analysis ( Mootha et al . , 2003 ) to identify a priori de ﬁ ned groups of genes that were signi ﬁ cantly differentially expressed . Expression changes observed among samples were attributable to two variables : developmental time ( E17 . 5 vs . P0 ) and genotype ( control vs . TKO ) . Comparison of control lenses at the two developmental stages identi ﬁ ed 408 genes that were downregulated and 174 that were upregulated in P0 lenses ( N 1 . 5 fold and p b 0 . 001 ) ( Fig . 5A , Fig . S3 ) . The expression of known E2F target genes , as de ﬁ ned by expression and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays , decreased with age , consistent with a decrease in proliferation as lenses develop from E17 . 5 to birth ( Black et al . , 2005 ; Bracken et al . , 2004 ; Kong et al . , 2007 ; Ren et al . , 2002 ; Vernell et al . , 2003 ; Weinmann et al . , 2002 ; Wells et al . , 2002 ; Xu et al . , 2007 ) ( Fig . 5B , Fig . S2A ) . Comparison between control and TKO lenses revealed a signi ﬁ cant number of gene expression changes at both developmental time points analyzed ( Fig . 5A , Figs . S2 , S4 ) . Signi ﬁ cantly changed gene ontology categories illustrated a bias for differential expression of genes involved in metabolism and DNA processing ( Eisen et al . , 1998 ) ( Least square and Kolmogorov – Smirnov permutation values of p b 0 . 001 ) ( Figs . S2B , S4 ) . Genes that were downregulated in TKO lenses , depicted in the lower third of the heatmap in Fig . 5A , were enriched for functions in the mitochondrion and oxidation reduction at E17 . 5 and , at P0 , for roles in the extracellular region , including proteins critical for cell adhesion and structural matrix , such as thrombospondin , procollagen , albumin , nidogen , perlecan , and laminin ( Fig . S6 ) . In contrast , genes contributing to DNA replication were uniformly upregulated in TKO tissues , including E2F targets such as chromatin licensing and DNA replication factor 1 ( Cdt1 ) and the minichromosome maintenance de ﬁ cient genes ( Mcm2 , Mcm3 , Mcm4 , Mcm5 , Mcm7 , Mcm8 ) . In fact , expression of nearly all E2F target genes was signi ﬁ cantly higher in TKO than in control lenses at both E17 . 5 and P0 ( Fig . 5C , D ) . Quantitative analysis of gene expression by real - time RT PCR was used to validate a subset of changes identi ﬁ ed by Affymetrix oligo arrays ( Fig . 5D ) . To characterize the spatial nature of E2F target misexpression , lenses were sectioned and probed with antibodies speci ﬁ c for several known downstream effectors of E2F . As shown in Fig . 5E , Mcm3 and PCNA protein levels were undetectable in control E17 . 5 lens ﬁ bers , whereas in TKO tissues these proteins were apparent in ﬁ ber cells and conspicuously elevated in the epithelium . Together , the gene Fig . 3 . Loss of E2F1 - 3 causes degradation andopaci ﬁ cationof thelens .

Wenzel et al . / Developmental Biology 351 ( 2011 ) 35 – 45 expression data and protein immunostaining of E2F targets points to a central role for E2F1 - 3 in transcriptional repression . Activation of pro - apoptotic gene expression in the p53 pathway Previously , we identi ﬁ ed a role for E2F in regulation of the p53 – p21 Cip1 axis ( Sharma et al . , 2006 ; Timmers et al . , 2007 ) . This relationship between E2F ablation and upregulation of p53 activity was further supported by recent evidence implicating the deacetylase Sirtuin 1 as a critical modulator of p53 in the murine retina ( Chen et al . , 2009 ) . In the current study , we observe increased expression of a number of regulators and downstream effectors of p53 ( Fig . 6A ) . Most notably , p21 Cip1 and p19 Arf were signi ﬁ cantly upregulated in TKO lenses ( Fig . 6B – D ) . Ectopic expression of p21 Cip1 protein was observed in the epithelium , loosely corresponding to an area approximately 60 degrees above the lens equator ( just anterior to TUNEL - positive enrichment depicted in Fig . 4D ) ( Fig . 6C ) . In contrast , p19 Arf was localized to the ﬁ ber compartment , and appeared throughout the ﬁ ber cytoplasm and in the nuclei of nucleated lens ﬁ bers ( Fig . 6C ) . The ﬁ ber - speci ﬁ c distribution of p19 Arf is intriguing , not only for its recognized role in stabilizing p53 through inhibition of Mdm2 , but also as a modulator of proliferation . It has been demonstrated in the murine eye that p19 Arf regulates Pdgf signaling , a pathway essential for cycling of the lens epithelium . Pdgfra and Pdgfrl are both misexpressed in TKO lenses , suggesting either that E2F directly regulates these genes or that p19 Arf is playing a role in suppression of cell cycling via Pdgfr modulation ( Fig . 2B ) . This cascade could be stimulated by signals initiated by p21 Cip1 in the epithelium or by ectopic proliferation and DNA synthesis in the ﬁ ber compartment ( Figs . 4C , 6C ) . Rb de ﬁ ciency provides context for E2F ' s role in proliferation The Rb tumor suppressor is a known regulator of E2Fs that is critical for the balanced proliferation of epithelial cells of the lens ( Jacks et al . , 1992 ) . Rb - null embryos exhibit ectopic cell proliferation in multiple tissues , including lens cells destined to exit the cell cycle at the equatorial plane . The loss of E2f3 suppresses the ectopic proliferation in Rb - de ﬁ cient lenses ( Saavedra et al . , 2002 ; Ziebold et al . , 2001 ) without impacting overall development of the lens , presumably because other E2F family members could compensate for loss of E2F3 by providing redundant functions needed for basal levels of cell proliferation in Rb / E2f3 doubly - de ﬁ cient lenses . While these ﬁ ndings have been interpreted as evidence that E2f3 is critical for cell proliferation , this inference disregards the possibility that the requirements for normal and ectopic cell proliferation caused by Rb de ﬁ ciency could differ . Thus , our current observation that E2F1 - 3 repress E2F targets and are dispensable for cell proliferation appears to contradict the general conclusions drawn from previous analyses of lenses that were singly or doubly de ﬁ cient for Rb and E2f3 ( Saavedra et al . , 2002 ; Ziebold et al . , 2001 ) . We therefore sought to explore the mechanistic relationship between Rb and E2F3 using the cry - cre in vivo system , such that results could be uniformly compared across different genetic con ﬁ gurations . We found that deletion of Rb in cry - cre ; Rb LoxP / LoxP embryos resulted in ectopic proliferation and apoptosis of ﬁ ber cells , culminating in a profound disruption of lens architecture ( Fig . 7A – D ) . As shown in Fig . 5 , loss of E2f3 suppressed the ectopic proliferation and apoptosis of Rb mutant ﬁ ber cells , but did not decrease proliferation or cell numbers below that observed in wild type lenses ( Figs . 7C , 5D ) . These results parallel previous observations in Rb − / − embryos ( Saavedra et al . , 2002 ; Ziebold et al . , 2001 ) but Fig . 4 .

Together with the analysis of E2f triply - de ﬁ cient lenses , these latter results support the idea that E2F3 promotes ectopic cell proliferation speci ﬁ cally in the context of Rb de ﬁ ciency . Discussion Contrary to many previous studies performed in cell culture , the data presented here suggest that E2F1 - 3 are not required for proliferation of lens epithelial cells ( Sharma et al . , 2006 ; Timmers Fig . 6 .

Wenzel et al . / Developmental Biology 351 ( 2011 ) 35 – 45 et al . , 2007 ; Wu et al . , 2001 ) . Instead , we show that E2F1 - 3 play a critical role in cell survival . It remains to be determined whether E2Fs are required in other tissues of the adult mouse , but it would appear from parallel analyses of neuroectodermal derivatives of the retina and endodermal derivatives of the small intestine ( Chen et al . , 2009 ; Chong et al . , 2009 ) that epithelial lineages in general do not require E2F1 - 3 to proliferate but do require them for cell survival . Indeed , it is also very likely that the majority of embryonic cell types do not require E2F1 - 3 for proliferation since triple mutant embryos can survive to E9 . 5 ( Chong et al . , 2009 ) . Since lens morphogenesis proceeds normally in the absence of E2F1 - 3 until late gestation , it is unlikely that the transcriptional control of ﬁ ber cell differentiation is disrupted prior to this stage . Primary ﬁ ber cell differentiation appears to have taken place normally Fig . 7 .

Wenzel et al . / Developmental Biology 351 ( 2011 ) 35 – 45 and major crystallin proteins are present with no noticeable disruption of distribution within the lens . In late gestation , however , there are some signi ﬁ cant changes in the abundance of key transcripts in lens development ( Fig . 2B ) . Most notably , lens epithelial cell associated transcripts ( Pax6 and connexin 43 ( Gja1 ) ) were elevated and lens ﬁ ber cell associated transcripts ( Prox1 and connexin 46 ( Gja3 ) ) were reduced . These changes in gene expression may represent a fundamental shift in the requirement of E2Fs in secondary versus primary ﬁ ber cell differentiation , or may result as a secondary effect of decreased lens cell survival . Whether any of these transcripts represent direct E2F target genes will require further investigation . Our results support the view that E2F1 - 3 family members normally function as transcriptional repressors at a time in develop - ment when cells are exiting the cell cycle ( Aslanian et al . , 2004 ; Leone et al . , 2000 ) . We show that loss of E2F1 - 3 in the lens results in ectopic expression of E2F target genes , many of which are required for nucleotide metabolism and DNA synthesis . It is interesting to note that upregulation of Mcm3 and PCNA was particularly acute in cells transitioning to G0 and that the Cdk inhibitors p27 and p57 were downregulated ( Figs . 2B , 5E ) . Further , this inappropriate expression of E2F targets was accompanied by a doubling of the number of epithelial cells incorporating BrdU and the appearance of DNA replication in ﬁ ber cells that are quiescent in normal lenses ( Fig . 1D ) . Given recent work establishing redundant roles for E2Fs in embryonic development ( Hurst et al . , 2008 ; Tsai et al . , 2008 ) , we would suggest that overlapping functions of E2F1 - 3 lie primarily in gene repression . The analysis of Rb and Rb - E2f3 mutant lenses suggests that the previously described requirement for E2Fs in proliferation and transcriptional activation may be restricted to speci ﬁ c cellular contexts where Rb protein is inactivated . Such situations could include abnormal proliferation in response to genetic alterations in Rb or normal proliferation induced in response to liver damage , immune cell activation , and acute growth factor activation . Earlier work has characterized the lenses of Rb - E2F3 - de ﬁ cient embryos ( Saavedra et al . , 2002 ; Ziebold et al . , 2001 ) , yet the conditional deletion strategy here demonstrates for the ﬁ rst time that the apoptotic defect found in Rb - null lenses is not a secondary defect caused by placental de ﬁ ciencies ( de Bruin et al . , 2003 ; Wenzel et al . , 2007 ; Wu et al . , 2003 ) but rather is due to a cell autonomous requirement for Rb function to balance transcriptional activation by E2F3 . In summary , the analysis of TKO lenses provides compelling in vivo evidence for a role of E2F1 , E2F2 and E2F3 in transcriptional repression and cell survival during normal developmental programs , and for a role in transcriptional activation and cell proliferation during specialized circumstances restricted to inactivation of Rb and its associated repressive cofactors , including histone deacetylases , SWI / SNF , lysine methyltransferases , arginine methyltransferases , and DNA methyltransferases .
