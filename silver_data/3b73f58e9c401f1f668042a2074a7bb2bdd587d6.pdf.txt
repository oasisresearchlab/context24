Group decision rules and group rationality under risk Aurélien Baillon 1 & Han Bleichrodt 1 & Ning Liu 1 & Peter P . Wakker 1 Published online : 15 June 2016 # The Author ( s ) 2016 . This article is published with open access at Springerlink . com Abstract This paper investigates the rationality of group decisions versus individual decisions under risk . We study two group decision rules , majority and unanimity , in stochastic dominance and Allais paradox tasks . We distinguish communication effects ( the effects of group discussions and interactions ) from aggregation effects ( mere impact of the voting procedure ) , which makes it possible to better understand the complex dynamics of group decision making . In an experiment , both effects occurred for intellective tasks whereas there were only aggregation effects in judgmental tasks . Communication effects always led to more rational choices ; aggregation effects did so sometimes but not always . Groups violated stochastic dominance less often than individuals did , which was due to both aggregation and communication effects . In the Allais paradox tasks , there were almost no communication effects , and aggregation effects made groups deviate more from expected utility than individuals .

C91 Many economic decisions — e . g . family financial planning , corporate strategies , nation - al laws — are made by groups . The literature comparing individual and group decision making is rich ( Kugler et al . 2012 ) . Groups have been found to attenuate , amplify , or replicate the biases found for individual decisions ( Kerr et al . 1996 ) , and these diverse findings highlight the closing remark of a recent review paper : B Ultimately , the goal of J Risk Uncertain ( 2016 ) 52 : 99 – 116 DOI 10 . 1007 / s11166 - 016 - 9237 - 8 Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article ( doi : 10 . 1007 / s11166 - 016 - 9237 - 8 ) contains supplementary material , which is available to authorized users . 1 Erasmus School of Economics , Erasmus University Rotterdam , Rotterdam , The Netherlands * Peter P . Wakker Wakker @ ese . eur . nl comparing individual and group decision making is to identify the contexts and types of decisions where each is likely to work best ^ ( Charness and Sutter 2012 , p . 174 ) . This paper compares group and individual decision making for three tasks : a test of non - transparent stochastic dominance , the Allais common consequence paradox , and the Allais common ratio paradox . Stochastic dominance is an objective , generally accepted criterion of rationality but recognizing it may require intellectual effort . We will therefore refer to this type of task as intellective . Previous research has shown that groups violate stochastic dominance less frequently than individuals ( Charness et al . 2007 ) , suggesting that group decisions improve rationality . Expected utility ( EU ) violations are to a large extent due to motivational or subjective aspects of human behavior . We will , therefore , call the Allais tasks judgmental . In this , we follow the psychological literature on group decisions ( e . g . Laughlin and Ellis 1986 ; Kerr and Tindale 2011 ) , where problems with a demonstrably correct answer are called intellec - tive and tasks in which one cannot objectively defend one ’ s preferred alternative as correct ( e . g . aesthetic judgments or matters of personal taste ) are called judgmental . In Allais ’ common consequence and common ratio paradoxes ( Allais 1953 ) , previous research has found that groups violate EU as often as individuals do ( Rockenbach et al . 2007 ; Bone et al . 1999 ; Bateman and Munro 2005 ) . We distinguish two components in group decision making : aggregation and com - munication . Aggregation refers to the direct effect of the procedure on the group decision , without involving any change of an individual or any communication . In single choice tasks , aggregation effects tend to amplify the patterns exhibited by the majority , as we will show ; these effects are merely procedural and statistical . For tasks involving two choices ( as in the Allais paradoxes ) , however , aggregation effects can reverse the majority pattern . It then is , for example , possible that , while a majority of the group members behave according to EU , the group decision violates EU . Aggre - gation effects are fleeting and do not influence individual attitudes or subsequent individual decisions . Communication effects do influence individuals . Communication effects are lasting and capture the effects of group decision making beyond pure aggregation . These effects include the impact of learning what others prefer and why they prefer it . For instance , group decision making can foster discussion and this may change members ’ preferences . Communication effects will persist after the group process has ended ( Maciejovsky et al . 2013 ) . In our experiment , we measured the strength of aggregation and communication effects for majority and unanimity group decisions . We elicited individual preferences before and after the group decision stage . Changes in individual preferences were interpreted as communication effects . We also used a second approach to measure communication effects . To control for the effect of aggregation , we aggregated the individual decisions before the group decision stage into simulated group decisions . Differences between these simulated decisions and the actual group decisions constitute communication effects . For instance , in the actual group decisions a minority some - times convinced a majority to change their preferences , which was clearly a commu - nication effect . The effects of decision rules are central in political economics ( Feddersen and Pesendorfer 1998 ; Messner and Polborn 2004 ) , and have also been studied in psychol - ogy ( Kerr and Tindale 2004 ) . However , they have rarely been considered for decisions 100 J Risk Uncertain ( 2016 ) 52 : 99 – 116 under risk . An exception is Brunette et al . ( 2015 ) , who implemented majority and unanimity voting rules , but did not permit verbal communication between group members . Most existing studies considered groups of two individuals , for which majority and unanimity rules make the same predictions and therefore cannot be distinguished . We used groups of three individuals , for which these rules can be distinguished . In intellective tasks , the results indicated that both rules led to aggrega - tion and communication effects , which improved both group rationality and individual rationality . In the judgmental tasks there were mainly aggregation effects , which led to more deviations from expected utility for groups than for individuals in one of the tasks ( the common ratio task ) . 1 Literature According to social - decision scheme theory ( Davis 1973 ) , group decisions are deter - mined by the majority view unless the minority view is demonstrably correct , which is the case where B truth wins ^ ( Laughlin and Ellis 1986 ; Davis 1992 ; Kerr and Tindale 2011 ) . This suggests that communication effects will be stronger when the reasons for choosing one option are easy to defend . Because answers in intellective tasks are easier to defend than answers in judgmental tasks , we expect that communication effects will be stronger in the non - transparent stochastic dominance ( NTSD ) tasks than in the Allais tasks . The literature on group decision processes shows that the unanimity rule typically leads to more communication than the majority rule . Moreover , group members identify themselves more with unanimous decisions than with majority decisions ( Kameda 1991 ) . The deliberations of unanimity groups show more conflicts and more changes of opinion ( Nemeth 1977 ) . Accordingly , we hypothesize that the unanimity rule leads to more discussion than the majority rule and , consequently , to stronger communication effects . Several studies have investigated the effect of different aggregation rules on the outcome of the decision process , both theoretically and experimentally . Dasgupta and Maskin ( 2008 ) showed theoretically that the majority rule satisfies five appealing conditions ( Pareto optimality , anonymity , neutrality , independence of irrelevant alter - natives , and decisiveness ) over a larger class of preferences than any other voting rule does and , in this sense , is the most robust rule . For jury decision making , Feddersen and Pesendorfer ( 1998 ) showed theoretically that the unanimity rule is more likely to convict the innocent and to acquit the guilty if jury members vote strategically . However , Goeree and Yariv ( 2011 ) found in an experiment that such differences in jury decisions vanish when deliberation before voting is allowed . Miller ( 1985 ) and Ohtsubo et al . ( 2004 ) showed experimentally that majority group decisions tend to ignore the minority ’ s preferences whereas the una - nimity decisions incorporate the minority ’ s preferences when information about each group member ’ s preference is available . Finally , Stasson et al . ( 1991 ) showed that subjects from majority groups performed marginally better than subjects from unanim - ity groups in mathematical tasks . However , groups consisting only of members who had answered incorrectly in the individual tasks were more likely to find the correct solution under the unanimity rule . J Risk Uncertain ( 2016 ) 52 : 99 – 116 101 2 Examples of aggregation effects To clarify the role of aggregation and to show how it can distort group decisions , we give two simple examples , one involving a single choice ( as in the NTSD task ) and one involving two choices ( as in the Allais paradoxes ) . A similar aggregation effect was discussed by Evans ( 1997 ) in a market context . 3 Method 3 . 1 Experimental design 102 J Risk Uncertain ( 2016 ) 52 : 99 – 116 Example 1 : Aggregation effects in a single choice Consider a choice between two lotteries where one lottery stochastically dom - inates the other . Assume that a minority of the population violates stochastic dominance . If people in this population form groups and the group choice is made by the majority rule , then sufficiently large groups will almost always satisfy stochastic dominance . Aggregation effects amplify the majority choice , and pro - vided the majority is rational , will amplify rationality . This results purely from the aggregation procedure , without involving any change of any person or any communication . Example 2 : Aggregation effects in a pair of choices Aggregation effects are more complex when two choices have to be made as in the Allais paradoxes . Consider two choices , each between a risky lottery R and a safe lottery S . Then there are four possible choice patterns : SS , RR , SR , and RS . The SS and RR patterns are consistent with EU ( EU - consistent ) , and the SR and RS patterns are EU - inconsistent . Suppose that 30 % of the sample chooses SS , 30 % chooses RR , and 40 % chooses SR . Then the majority of the population ( 60 % ) is EU - consistent . If we randomly draw groups of three persons from this population and let the group choice be determined by majority then SR will be chosen in 56 . 8 % of the cases and the majority thus exhibits an EU - inconsistent pattern . The opposite case ( a majority of EU - inconsistent people leading to a majority of EU - consistent groups ) can also occur . 1 Again , this results purely from the aggregation procedure . N = 156 students of Erasmus University Rotterdam participated in the experiment ( 63 % males ) . We organized 52 sessions of three subjects each . The experiment consisted of three stages ( within - subjects ) and three treatments ( between - subjects ; see Table 1 ) . A stage consisted of a set of instructions and decision tasks , which subjects received on paper ( called answer sheets hereafter ) . All decision tasks were choices between two lotteries . The subjects in a session each had their own colored pen ( blue , red , or black ) to mark their preferred lottery on the answer sheet so that we could identify individual choices . 1 If the individuals exhibit patterns SS , RR , SR , and RS with probability 40 % , 0 % , 30 % , and 30 % respectively , then the groups will exhibit the same patterns with probability 56 . 8 % , 0 % , 21 . 6 % , and 21 . 6 % . In the first and third stages of the experiment , subjects made individual choices and were not allowed to talk with each other . Only the second stage of the experiment differed between treatments . In the control treatment , subjects made individual deci - sions ( without communication ) , as in the other two stages . This permitted us to check for any learning effect . In the M - treatment , the three subjects in a session made group decisions using the majority rule and they could communicate face - to - face in English . All subjects , after ( possible ) discussion , marked their preferred lotteries . The option with at least two ticks was taken as the group choice , but minority subjects could still express disagreement . In the U - treatment subjects had to reach unanimity . All three subjects of a session had to tick the same lottery , otherwise the choice was invalid and would not be paid ( see the section on incentives below ) . The groups of the U - treatment always reached unanimity . Subjects could freely and directly communicate during the group decisions ( stage 2 of M - and U - treatment ) . In the control treatment , answering all questions took 21 minutes on average . In the other two treatments , subjects needed about 7 minutes more due to group deliberations . Stage 1 gave us information on subjects ’ behavior before any treatment manipula - tion . We used these choices to simulate the group decisions that would have been made based on the majority rule and , thereby , we inferred the effect of pure aggregation without any communication . We could then compare the actual group decisions in stage 2 with these simulated decisions to measure the effects beyond pure aggregation . Finally , stage 3 gave information about whether any changes in preferences that we observed in stage 2 were temporary ( and thus probably due to aggregation effects ) or lasting ( which is likely for communication effects ) . Each session of three subjects was randomly assigned to one treatment . We ran 13 sessions for the control treatment , 21 sessions for the M - treatment , and 18 sessions for the U - treatment . There were fewer sessions of the control treatments to have more observations in M - and U - treatments , which concerned the main research questions . 3 . 2 Stimuli Subjects faced three types of decision tasks in each stage of the experiment : NTSD tasks , common ratio ( CR ) tasks , and common consequence ( CC ) tasks . We present these tasks below . The order of the choices was randomized within each of the three stages ( it was therefore possible that two questions for the same CR task were far apart in the experi - ment ) , but the order was the same for all subjects within a particular treatment . Huber et al . ( 2008 ) showed that choices are affected by the first and the last choice made . No distortions result when there are no more than three choices , as in our experiment . Subjects had to choose between two lotteries , A and B . Table 2 gives an example of the way choices were displayed . Uncertainty was resolved using the roll of a 20 - sided Table 1 Structure of the experiment Stage 1 Stage 2 Stage 3 Control Individual Individual Individual M - treatment Individual Majority rule Individual U - treatment Individual Unanimity rule Individual J Risk Uncertain ( 2016 ) 52 : 99 – 116 103 die . The first row of Table 2 shows the possible outcomes of the roll of the die . Rows 2 and 3 show the payoffs of the two lotteries under each possible roll of the die . Subjects indicated their choice by ticking the cell of the last column of their preferred lottery . 3 . 2 . 1 NTSD tasks Charness et al . ( 2007 ) found that groups are more likely to satisfy stochastic dominance than individuals , but did not specify the aggregation rule that groups should follow and did not check whether the group effects persisted in later individual choices . Maciejovsky et al . ( 2013 ) found that group effects persisted in intellective tasks other than NTSD , but they did not distinguish between the majority rule and the unanimity rule as their group size was two people , for which the two rules lead to the same results . We adapted the NTSD tasks first used by Tversky and Kahneman ( 1986 ) . Table 2 is an example of an NTSD task faced by the subjects . Lottery B results from lottery A by improving € 30 into € 35 and by improving two outcomes € 5 into € 10 . Consequently , lottery B stochastically dominates lottery A . However , this dominance is not immediately obvious and a subject who neglects probability differences and only compares the outcomes of the lotteries may have the false impression that A is better than B because it yields money amounts € 5 , € 30 , and € 35 , whereas Lottery B yields money amounts € 5 , € 10 , and € 35 . Because the violation of stochastic dominance in Table 2 is non - transparent , we refer to these tasks as NTSD . Some theories allow for such violations of stochastic dominance ( Kahneman and Tversky 1979 ; Viscusi 1989 ) . Table 3 summarizes the tests of non - transparent stochastic dominance that we carried out . The tests are comparable in structure but differ across the three stages .

Table 6 shows the way the CR choices were presented to the subjects . The second choice follows from the first by dividing all probabilities at nonzero outcomes by 4 . According to the independence condition of EU ( Fishburn and Wakker 1995 ) , this should not affect preferences . Hence EU predicts the same choice in both situations , either SS or RR . However , empirically , the prevailing pattern is SR , which violates EU . The opposite violation , RS , occurs rarely . Table 7 presents the values used . 2 Stage 1 had four CC tasks and stages 2 and 3 had three CC tasks .

The first choice was therefore 25 with probability 20 % , 8 with probability 40 % ( = 100 % 25 with probability 20 % and nothing otherwise The CC tasks were close to those of Huck and Müller ( 2012 ) with a small adjustment to fit into our 20 - sided die format . Table 4 shows the structure of the CC tasks . Table 5 presents the different values of s , r , and q that we used in the experiment . 2 Each CC task involved two choices between lottery S and lottery R with the second choice similar to the first except that the ( common ) q chance ( 60 % in the above example ) of € s was changed into a q chance of nothing . According to the sure - thing principle of EU ( Savage 1954 ) , replacing a common payoff by another common payoff does not affect preference . Hence EU predicts the same preference in both choices , either SS or RR . However , empirically , many subjects violate EU and display the pattern SR , which can be due to the certainty effect ( see Starmer 2000 for a survey ) . The opposite pattern , RS , occurs less frequently ( Starmer 1992 ; Wu et al . 2005 ; Blavatskyy 2013 ) . 3 . 2 . 4 Incentives Upon completion of the experiment , subjects received a € 5 participation fee . In addition , they played out one of their choices for real . First , one of the three stages was randomly selected . All subjects in a session played out a choice that was made in this stage . If the selected stage was an individual stage ( stages 1 and 3 for the M - and U - treatments , and all stages for the control treatment ) , each subject randomly drew one choice and played out the lottery he preferred in that choice . If the second stage was selected in the M - and U - treatments , the lottery the group had chosen was played out and the three subjects received the same payoff . In the group decision making stage , subjects shared the consequences of their choice . We explained this group incentive procedure in the M - and U - treatments at the beginning of stage 2 . The instructions were the same across treatments , except for stage 2 . 3 . 3 Analysis In the individual decisions ( all three stages of the control and stage 1 and 3 of the M - and U - treatments ) , we obviously used subjects ’ reported choices . In the group decisions ( stage 2 for the M - and U - treatments ) , we assigned the choices of the subject ’ s group to each subject . For the M - treatment in stage 2 , we also had the information about the choices reported by each subject , because they were allowed to express disagreement with the group choice . Thirty - one percent of the majority group decisions revealed disagreement . Our conclusions did not depend on whether we used the group choices or the reported choices in the second stage of the M - treatment ( see Online Appendix A ) . We used probit models to study the likelihood of violations of stochastic dominance and multinomial probit models to study the likelihood of the four CC and CR patterns . Logit models , reported in Online Appendix B , gave similar results . We used clustered standard errors in the probit regressions . For the NTSD task , the dependent ( binary ) variable indicated whether or not the choice satisfied stochastic dominance . For the CC and the CR tasks , the dependent ( categorical ) variable described the choice pattern ( SS , SR , RS , or RR ) .

The main effects stage2 and stage3 captured the effect of learning . Our main independent variables represented the interaction terms of the treatments with the stages . The terms majority * stage2 and unanimity * stage2 identified the full effect of group decision making ( both aggregation and communication effects ) . The terms majority * stage3 and unanimity * stage3 captured the changes in preferences after the group stage and provided a first method to estimate communication effects . As explained before , the second method to disentangle aggregation and communi - cation effects used the individual choices ( of stage 1 for the M - and U - treatments and stages 1 and 2 for the control treatment ) to simulate aggregate choices . For the majority rule , as each session consisted of three subjects , we could in each case simulate the majority group choice . These simulated group choices captured the pure aggregation effects . The difference between the simulated and the actual group choices provided an estimate of communication effects . The majority preference is also the most plausible benchmark for the U - treatment . A deviation from the majority choice then can only occur if some group members were willing to change their minds , and there must then have been communication effects . The analysis of the simulated and the group choices was done the same way as the analysis of the individual and the group choices , which was described above , except that we excluded stage 3 ( which would give no useful insights ) and thus used fewer data points . Finally , we also recorded and studied the group discussions . In nearly 40 % of the groups , arguments based on stochastic dominance were used ( without using this term though ) . The dummy variable dominance _ discussion identified the members of such groups . 4 Results 4 . 1 NTSD tasks Figure 1 displays the proportion of choices satisfying stochastic dominance , for the actual choices ( panel A ) and when individual choices are replaced by the simulated choices ( panel B ) . Panel A shows that only a minority of subjects chose the dominant lottery in the first stage . In the control treatment , the proportion of choices satisfying stochastic dominance increased from around 40 % in stage 1 to around 50 % in stage 2 to slightly below 60 % in stage 3 , suggesting modest learning . In the M - and U - treatments , we see a faster increase in the second stage , due to aggregation and communication effects . The comparison of the group choices with the simulated choices ( panel B ) confirms that even though subjects of all treatments better identify dominant lotteries as the experiment progresses , this improvement is faster in the M - and U - treatments than in the control treatment . Table 8 reports the results of the probit regressions . The first column , which reports the results for the actual choices , shows that the use of stochastic dominance arguments in the group discussion was crucial . Groups in which no stochastic dominance argu - ments were used did not differ from the control treatment . However , there were strong group effects in stages 2 and 3 for groups that did talk about stochastic dominance ( captured by the three - way interaction terms between stages , treatments and dominance _ discussion ) . Hence , a subject who used stochastic dominance arguments strongly affected not only his group ’ s choices in stage 2 but also the individual choices of his fellow group members in stage 3 , indicating communication effects . In the M - treatment , the significant interaction term dominance _ discussion * majority captures the difference in satisfaction of stochastic dominance in stage 1 between subjects who talked about stochastic dominance in stage 2 and those who did not . The comparison of group choices with simulated choices confirmed that communi - cation effects played a role in both the M - treatment and the U - treatment . Once aggregation effects were ruled out , groups that talked about stochastic dominance were still more likely to choose the dominant lotteries in all stages than groups that did not talk about stochastic dominance . The three - way interactions between majority , dominance _ discussion , and stage2 and between unanimity , dominance _ discussion , and stage2 were significant , showing that the choices of groups that talked about stochastic dominance were affected by communication effects beyond pure aggregation effects . Majority and unanimity seemed to have fostered discussions , which increased subjects ’ rationality . The importance of avoiding biases and increasing rationality has often been emphasized ( Viscusi 1995 , p . 108 ) and our analysis shows that group decision making can contribute here .

In the first stage , half of our subjects ’ choices were consistent with EU ( 32 % of the choice patterns were RR and 18 % were SS ) . Surprisingly , the violations of EU were mainly of the RS type : 45 % of the patterns were RS and only 5 % of the empirically common SR . This finding does not confirm the certainty effect . The low occurrence of the SR pattern led to estimation problems and we excluded it from the analysis reported below . Keeping the SR pattern whenever possible gave similar results as those reported next ( see Online Appendix C ) . The proportion of EU violations slightly dropped in the second stage , but this held for all treatments and it disappeared in the third stage . The control and the M - treatment are very similar . In the U - treatment , there was a more pronounced increase in the proportion of RR choices , but , again , the effect did not last . Several studies have found that risk aversion is negatively related to cognitive ability ( Frederick 2005 ; Dohmen et al . 2010 , 2011 ) . Hence the unanimity rule may also lead to more rationality in the CC task .

( 2011 ) found that groups were more risk seeking than individuals . On the other hand , Masclet et al . ( 2009 ) found that groups were more risk averse than individuals . Adams and Ferreira ( 2010 ) found that groups made decisions closer to risk neutrality than individuals do . Table 9 shows the results of the multinomial probit regressions . Subjects became more risk averse during the experiment as indicated by the positive coefficient of stage 3 in the SS choices . Groups were more risk seeking than individuals : in stage 2 , the prevalence of the SS pattern was less in the M - and U - treatments than in the control treatment . The RR pattern was also more common in the U - treatment than in the control group in stage 2 . However , the two - way interactions in stage 3 ( stage3 * majority and stage3 * unanimity ) were not significant and there was no evidence of communication effects .

The tendency to make riskier group decisions was thus mainly due to aggregation effects . 4 . 3 CR tasks In the CR tasks ( Fig . 3 ) , we again found that about half of the subjects satisfied EU in the first stage ( 29 % SS pattern , 22 % RR pattern ) . This time we found the usual SR violation of EU ( 41 % ) . We do not report the results about the infrequent RS pattern , because it led to estimation problems in one of the regressions . Keeping the RS pattern did not affect the results of the other regressions as can be seen in Online Appendix C . As in the CC tasks , group choices tended to be more risk seeking than individual choices . However , this time the shift was predominantly from SS to the EU - inconsistent SR pattern and less so to the EU - consistent RR pattern . The multinomial probit regressions in Table 10 confirmed that the M - and U - treatments decreased the number of SS patterns and increased the number of SR patterns . These effects did not last in stage 3 , suggesting that they were aggregation effects . This suggestion was confirmed by the comparison between the group choices and the simulated choices , in which these effects disappeared : the prevalence of the SS and SR patterns in the actual group choices ( stage 2 of the M - and U - treatments ) did not differ from the prevalence of these patterns in the simulated choices .

This was not observed in the regression comparing groups with individual choices . This result indicates that aggregation effects and communication effects had opposite effects on the proportion of RR choices . Commu - nication effects led to an increase in RR choices , whereas aggregation effects reduced them . These effects could not be observed in the actual choices because the aggregation effects and communication effects were close in magnitude and cancelled out . It shows the added value of analyzing the simulated choices . The finding that communication effects led to more risk seeking suggests that individual choices may be too risk averse and ( some ) more risk seeking may be rational . On the other hand , the effect was only modest and unlike the findings on NTSD , it did not persist in the third stage . 4 . 4 Additional analysis We recorded the decision time at each stage .

This allowed us to analyze the effects of unanimity and majority rules on intellective and judgmental tasks under risk . Our results show that : a ) Both aggregation effects and communication effects occurred , but these effects were stronger and occurred more often under the unanimity rule . b ) Aggregation effects were mixed and did not always lead to more rational choices . Aggregation effects reduced violations of stochastic dominance , but they also reduced EU - consistent patterns in Allais ’ common ratio tasks , and they changed the distribution of EU - consistent choice patterns in Allais ’ common consequence task without affecting the overall proportion of EU - consistent choice patterns . c ) Communication effects favored the justifiable ( rational ) choices and had more impact in intellective tasks than in judgmental tasks . When there was a clear argument for a particular choice , such as in the nontransparent stochastic domi - nance tasks , then communication effects could strongly increase the proportion of such choices in the group decisions . Communication effects led to more risk seeking in the common ratio tasks ( with marginal significance ) , but not in the common consequence tasks . Communication effects increased rationality but they also increased decision times . The separation of communication and aggregation effects introduced in this paper sheds new light on the pros and cons of group decision rules and on their differences with individual decisions . In particular , we can test whether these rules increase the rationality of group decisions , and have a lasting impact on individual decisions after the group process is over . Our results show that communication effects play an important role in group decisions . Acknowledgments Gary Charness , Enrico Diecidue , Yoram Halevy , the editor W .
