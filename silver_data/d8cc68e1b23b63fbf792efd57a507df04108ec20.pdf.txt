Kaksonen @ unige . ch Abstract Clathrin - mediated endocytosis is a conserved eukaryotic membrane trafficking pathway that is driven by a sequentially assembled molecular machinery that contains over 60 different proteins . SH3 domains are the most abundant protein - protein interaction domain in this process , but the function of most SH3 domains in protein dynamics remains elusive . Using mutagenesis and live - cell fluorescence microscopy in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae , we dissected SH3 - mediated regulation of the endocytic pathway . Our data suggest that multiple SH3 domains regulate the actin nucleation promoting Las17 / Vrp1 complex , and that the network of SH3 interactions coordinate both Las17 / Vrp1 assembly and dissociation . Furthermore , most endocytic SH3 domain proteins use the SH3 domain for their own recruitment , while a minority uses the SH3 domain to recruit other proteins , and not themselves . Our results provide a dynamic map of SH3 functions in yeast endocytosis and a framework for SH3 interaction network studies across biology . 1 Introduction Clathrin - mediated endocytosis is a conserved eukaryotic process by which cells internalize plasma membrane and extracellular material . Over 60 different proteins assemble at the plasma membrane to coordinate cargo collection , formation of a membrane invagination and vesicle release ( McMahon & Boucrot , 2011 ; Kaksonen & Roux , 2018 ) . In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae , endocytic protein assembly is stereotypical and sequential . The endocytic proteins can be categorized based on their spatio - temporal dynamics at endocytic sites into one of four modules ( Kaksonen et al . , 2005 ) : the coat , the actin nucleation promoting factors ( NPF ) , the actin patch or the scission module . However , within a module , individual proteins characteristically assemble and disassemble with different kinetics , which implies that the protein - protein interactions ( PPI ) between endocytic proteins occur within a precise spatial and temporal context . This symphony of events is poorly understood , but central to endocytic site progression . A major PPI network in endocytosis is the SH3 interaction network ( Tong et al . , 2002 ; Tonikian et al . , 2009 ) . SH3 domains are a versatile PPI domain family , typically found in eukaryotic proteins involved in pathways regulating the cytoskeleton and membrane traffic . In yeast endocytosis , SH3 domains are the most abundant PPI domain family and the only domain family present in all four endocytic modules ( Goode et al . , 2015 ) . The two major categories of functions of endocytic SH3 interactions are the coordination of actin regulators and protein recruitment ( Fazi et al . , 2002 ; Tong et al . , 2002 ; Sun et al . , 2006 ; Tonikian et al . , 2009 ; Feliciano & Di Pietro , 2012 ; Sun et al . , 2015 ; Sun et al . , 2017 ) . Yeast endocytosis is dependent on the formation of a branched actin network , which drives membrane invagination ( Kaksonen et al . , 2003 ) . The primary actin nucleation promoting factors ( NPFs ) , found in the NPF module , are the WASp - homolog , Las17 , and the paralogous type - I myosins Myo3 and Myo5 in conjunction with verprolin , Vrp1 ( Weinberg & Drubin , 2012 ; Goode et al . , 2015 ) . Las17 is in a complex with Vrp1 and together this complex contains numerous proline - rich motifs , which are considered to be binding targets of the SH3 domains of all nine endocytic SH3 proteins in different modules : Sla1 , Lsb3 / 4 paralogs ( coat ) , Bzz1 , Bbc1 , Myo3 / 5 paralogs ( NPF ) , Abp1 ( actin ) and Rvs167 ( scission ) ( Tong et al . , 2002 ; Tonikian et al . , 2009 ) . Sla1 recruits Las17 to endocytic sites via its SH3 domains ( Feliciano & Di Pietro , 2012 ; Sun et al . , 2015 ) . Las17 molecules localize to 2 a ring - shaped region around the coat ( Mund et al . , 2018 ) . During the actin phase , Sla1 is associated with the invagination tip , but the Las17 - Vrp1 complex ( LVC ) is located at the invagination base where it is regulated by Bbc1 and Myo5 ( Kaksonen et al . , 2005 ; Sun et al . , 2006 ; Picco et al . , 2015 ) . Bbc1 limits the Las17 ring size , and inhibits an excessive assembly of actin filaments ( Mund et al . , 2018 ; Picco et al . , 2018 ) , possibly via SH3 interactions . The Myo5 SH3 domain binds Vrp1 , which promotes Myo5 assembly and thereby actin network growth ( Anderson et al . , 1998 ; Sun et al . , 2006 ) . These data point to a central role for SH3 domains regulating actin network assembly at endocytic sites . Evidence also indicates that the SH3 domains of Myo5 , Lsb4 and Rvs167 are involved in the recruitment of these proteins to endocytic sites ( Sun et al . , 2006 ; Urbanek et al . , 2015 ; Menon & Kaksonen , 2021 ) . This is in contrast to Sla1 , which has an SH3 - independent recruitment to endocytic sites ( Sun et al . , 2015 ) . Whether the other SH3 proteins use their SH3 domains to regulate the LVC complex or their own recruitment remains an open question . In this study , we aimed to connect SH3 - mediated SH3 protein assembly with SH3 - mediated LVC regulations . We tested if assembly of Lsb3 , Bzz1 , Bbc1 and Abp1 is dependent on their SH3 domains . Our results suggest a new categorization of endocytic SH3 domains , which is based on their functions as recruitment factors . Furthermore , we show that Abp1 , Bzz1 and Rvs167 SH3 interactions regulate the LVC at endocytic sites . These new LVC regulations may indicate feedback mechanisms for actin nucleation control . Results The SH3 domains of Bzz1 have distinct functions Bzz1 is an NPF module protein with two SH3 domains of unknown function . We aimed to dissect if and how these SH3 domains regulate Bzz1 assembly . From the N - to C - terminus Bzz1 has a membrane - binding F - BAR domain , an SH3 domain ( SH3A ) , a proline - rich motif ( PRM ) and a second SH3 domain ( SH3B ) ( fig . 1A ) . Metazoan orthologs , Pascins / Syndapins and Fchsds / Nervous wreck , have reported intramolecular interactions between their F - BAR and SH3 domains ( Rao et al . , 2010 ; 3 Stanishneva - Konovalova et al . , 2016 ) . A similar membrane specificity and SH3 - mediated PPI may also regulate Bzz1 assembly . A previous report suggests that F - BAR membrane binding promotes Bzz1 recruitment but a role for the Bzz1 SH3 domains is undescribed ( Kishimoto et al . , 2011 ) . Bzz1 SH3 domains were investigated by endogenously - tagged Bzz1 mutant proteins with a C - terminal eGFP and imaged by live - cell fluorescence microscopy . Bzz1 - eGFP formed patches at the plasma membrane ( fig . 1A ) similar to previous reports ( Sun et al . , 2006 ) . In contrast , Bzz1 protein lacking both SH3 domains and the PRM ( Bzz1 ( SH3AΔ PRMΔ SH3BΔ ) - eGFP ) showed no patch formation at all ( fig . 1A ) , which suggests that its C - terminal domains are needed for Bzz1 recruitment to endocytic sites . Next , we tested the contribution of individual C - terminal domains to Bzz1 recruitment . We analyzed two truncation mutants , Bzz1 ( SH3BΔ ) - eGFP and Bzz1 ( PRMΔ SH3BΔ ) - eGFP , a point mutant , Bzz1 ( W531A ) - eGFP , which altered the canonical binding site of the Bzz1 SH3A domain , and a PRM mutant Bzz1 ( PRM * ) - eGFP , where the PRM was substituted with a flexible linker ( PAPEVPPPRR → SGGGGSGGGG ) . Each of these four Bzz1 mutants formed patches ( fig . 1A ) . To be more sensitive to low intensity fluorescence , we used total internal reflection fluorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy to quantify Bzz1 assembly dynamics . In addition , we used Abp1 - mCherry as an actin marker and time reference for the endocytic actin phase . Bzz1 - eGFP had a lifetime of about 20 seconds ( fig . 1B ) , comparable to previous reports ( Sun et al . , 2006 ; Kishimoto et al . , 2011 ) . Abp1 - mCherry started assembling about 10 s after Bzz1 , reached the peak intensity together with Bzz1 and then the two proteins disassembled with similar timing . Bzz1 assembly rate was constant or slightly exponential until Bzz1 molecule numbers reached their maximum . In contrast , before the Abp1 signal , Bzz1 ( SH3BΔ ) - eGFP assembled slowly but then during the actin phase accumulated more quickly . Bzz1 ( PRMΔ SH3BΔ ) - eGFP only assembled during the actin phase and its signal resembled the second , fast accumulation phase of Bzz1 ( SH3BΔ ) . Bzz1 ( W531A ) - eGFP signal was similar to the Bzz1 - eGFP signal . The assembly slope of Bzz1 ( PRM * ) - eGFP was similar to the one of Bzz1 ( SH3BΔ ) , with a slow start and a quick accumulation during the actin phase . The data suggest that the PRM and SH3B interactions regulate initial Bzz1 assembly before the actin phase and the SH3A promotes Bzz1 recruitment specifically during the actin phase . 4 We suspected that the Bzz1 SH3A interaction could be actin - dependent due to its specific contribution to Bzz1 assembly during the actin phase . We tested if the Bzz1 mutants form patches in cells treated with Latrunculin A ( LatA ) , which inhibits actin polymerization and consequently invagination growth , effectively stalling endocytic sites ( Ayscough et al . , 1997 ; Kaksonen et al . , 2003 ) . Loss of Abp1 - mCherry patches was used as a control for the efficacy of the LatA treatment . Upon LatA treatment , all Bzz1 mutants retained patch localization except Bzz1 ( PRMΔ SH3BΔ ) - eGFP ( fig . 1C ) . Thus , the Bzz1 SH3A interaction requires the actin phase to occur , while the PRM and SH3B interactions are actin - independent . Previous studies have suggested that Sla1 SH3 domains compete with Bzz1 SH3 domains ( Sun et al . , 2006 ) and others indicate Sla1 SH3 interactions with the Bzz1 PRM ( Barry & Di Pietro , 2015 ) . Consequently , actin - dependency of Bzz1 patch formation could change in the absence of Sla1 . Hence , we treated sla1Δ cells with LatA and analyzed WT and mutant Bzz1 patch formation . We noted a change in the percentage of cells that retained Bzz1 patches and we quantified this phenotype . Bzz1 - eGFP patch occurrence was slightly increased by the deletion of Sla1 ( fig . 1C ) . In the case of Bzz1 ( SH3BΔ ) - eGFP , patch formation could be observed in only around half as many LatA - treated sla1Δ than WT cells ( fig . 1C ) . Surprisingly , Bzz1 ( PRMΔ SH3BΔ ) - eGFP , the Bzz1 mutant that did not form patches in LatA - treated WT cells , formed patches in the majority of LatA - treated sla1Δ cells ( fig . 1C ) . Thus , Bzz1’s SH3A can promote Bzz1 recruitment in LatA - treated cells in the absence of Sla1 . This observation can also explain the patch formation of Bzz1 ( SH3BΔ ) - eGFP in LatA - treated sla1Δ cells . Our results suggest that the Bzz1 PRM interacts with Sla1 SH3 domains but also that Sla1 inhibits Bzz1’s SH3A . In conclusion , to promote Bzz1 assembly , the Bzz1 SH3A interaction requires the actin phase in the presence of Sla1 , but not in absence of Sla1 . These results support the binding competition between Sla1 and Bzz1 for Las17 observed in vitro and suggest these competition dynamics change during the actin phase . 5 Figure 1 : Bzz1’s SH3 domains regulate Bzz1 recruitment distinctly .

C ) Bzz1 patch formation upon LatA treatment in WT and sla1Δ cells . Images of 6 representative cells are maximum intensity projections of 5 min time lapse movies . Scale bar : 2 μm . Quantification shows the percentage of cells with patches . Bzz1 and Rvs167 antagonize Sla1 and promote Las17 dissociation Deletion of Bzz1 causes only mild endocytic phenotypes ( Sun et al . , 2006 ; Kishimoto et al . , 2011 ) , which complicates the analysis of its function . We speculated that Bzz1’s deletion phenotype may be masked by other redundant regulatory pathways . The observation that Bzz1 is inhibited by Sla1 might therefore be a gateway to revealing Bzz1’s function in endocytosis . We speculated that Bzz1 might reveal a function in LatA - treated sla1Δ cells as the Bzz1 SH3 interactions are not inhibited in this condition . Thus , we analyzed patch formation of potential Bzz1 interaction partners in LatA - treated WT and sla1Δ cells . The NPF module proteins Las17 , Vrp1 and Myo5 formed persistent patches in LatA - treated WT cells when observed over a period of 5 minutes ( fig . 2A ) . However , in LatA - treated sla1Δ cells , patch formation of Las17 , Vrp1 and Myo5 was disturbed ( fig . 2A ) . We could observe three types of patches for the NPF module proteins : ( A ) dim and persistent patches at the plasma membrane , ( B ) bright and transient patches at the plasma membrane and ( C ) transient patches in the cytoplasm . Las17 , Vrp1 and Myo5 appeared to be unstably associated with endocytic sites in LatA - treated sla1Δ cells . In contrast , the coat protein , Pan1 , only formed persistent patches at the plasma membrane in both LatA - treated WT and sla1Δ cells ( fig . 2A ) . These data suggest that specifically NPF module dissociation is misregulated in LatA - treated sla1Δ cells . We hypothesized that the non - inhibited Bzz1 causes the dissociation of the NPF module from endocytic sites . Thus , we analyzed Las17 patch formation in LatA - treated WT , sla1Δ and sla1Δ bzz1Δ cells ( fig . 2B ) : The number of cells showing persistent Las17 patches decreased from 100 % in LatA - treated WT cells to 80 % in LatA - treated sla1Δ cells , but was again 100 % in sla1Δ bzz1Δ cells . Transient Las17 patch formation at the plasma membrane could be observed in 28 % of LatA - treated WT cells . For LatA - treated sla1Δ cells , it was 82 % , roughly three times more compared to WT cells . However , in LatA - treated sla1Δ bzz1Δ cells , the number of cells with transient plasma membrane - associated 7 patches was 25 % , close to WT levels . Cytoplasmic Las17 patches could be observed in just 1 % of LatA - treated WT cells but in 54 % of the LatA - treated sla1Δ cells . In contrast to that , only 5 % of the LatA - treated sla1Δ bzz1Δ cells showed cytoplasmic Las17 patches . These results suggested that , in absence of Sla1 , Bzz1 decreases the formation of stable Las17 patches , promotes transient Las17 patch formation and affects Las17 localization . Overall , deletion of Bzz1 largely rescued normal Las17 patch association to the plasma membrane in LatA - treated sla1Δ cells . Taken together these data indicate that Bzz1 perturbs Las17 association to endocytic sites and that this function can be inhibited by Sla1 . We then tested whether deletion of other proteins could also rescue the Las17 phenotype observed in LatA - treated sla1Δ cells . We chose Syp1 and Bbc1 , two other patch proteins that regulate Las17 ( Weinberg & Drubin , 2012 ; Goode et al . , 2015 ) , as well as Rvs167 due to its domain similarity to Bzz1 . Deletion of Rvs167 causes failure of endocytic vesicle scission and cell growth defects . Therefore , we used a deletion of the Rvs167 SH3 domain , rvs167 ( SH3Δ ) , which causes a milder phenotype ( Menon & Kaksonen , 2021 ) . In LatA - treated sla1Δ syp1Δ and sla1Δ bbc1Δ cells , the number of cells with either transient plasma membrane - associated or cytoplasmic patches were comparable to sla1Δ cells ( fig . 2B ) . In contrast , the deletion of the Rvs167 SH3 domain partly suppressed the Las17 phenotype , but the effect was milder than the deletion of Bzz1 ( fig . 2B ) . These results suggest that Rvs167 and Bzz1 both regulate Las17 in absence of Sla1 . Therefore we combined the Bzz1 and Rvs167 mutations and analyzed Las17 patches in LatA - treated sla1Δ bzz1Δ rvs167 ( SH3Δ ) cells . We found that Las17 patches were hyper - persistent as the percentage of cells with transient Las17 patches at the plasma membrane was only 2 % in LatA - treated sla1Δ bzz1Δ rvs167 ( SH3Δ ) cells , much lower than in LatA - treated WT cells ( fig . 2B ) . These results suggest that in sla1Δ cells Bzz1 and Rvs167 can modify Las17 patch persistence . When Sla1 was not deleted , the effect of bzz1Δ , rvs167 ( SH3Δ ) and bzz1Δ rvs167 ( SH3Δ ) on the number of cells with transient Las17 patches at the plasma membrane was weak ( fig . 2B ) . Thus , it appears that Sla1 largely inhibits the effects of Bzz1 and Rvs167 in regard to Las17 regulation in LatA - treated cells . To see if Bzz1 and Rvs167 antagonize Sla1 also in normal drug free conditions , we tested whether growth defects of sla1Δ cells could be restored by the deletion of Bzz1 and / or the Rvs167 SH3 domain ( fig . 2C ) . The sla1Δ bzz1Δ and 8 sla1Δ rvs167 ( SH3Δ ) strains indeed grew much better than sla1Δ cells , which confirmed that Bzz1 and Rvs167 antagonism to Sla1 is not an artifact of the LatA - treatment . The deletion of Bzz1 had a slightly stronger effect on growth rescue than the deletion of the Rvs167 SH3 domain , correlating with the effects on Las17 patch formation in LatA - treated cells ( fig . 2B ) . The combined mutant sla1Δ bzz1Δ rvs167 ( SH3Δ ) grew slightly worse in comparison with sla1Δ cells . The single deletion of Bzz1 or the Rvs167 SH3 domain showed no effect on cell growth , but bzz1Δ rvs167 ( SH3Δ ) cells had a synthetic growth defect ( fig . 2C ) . Cooperation of Bzz1 and Rvs167 has already been suggested , but in the context of vesicle scission ( Kishimoto et al . , 2011 ) . Our growth assay suggests a commonality between Bzz1 and Rvs167 in addition to scission control , as rvs167 ( SH3Δ ) causes no scission failure ( Menon & Kaksonen , 2021 ) . In summary , our results show that Las17 association to endocytic sites is disturbed in LatA - treated sla1Δ cells . Deletion of the Rvs167 SH3 domain and Bzz1 could rescue this defect and also partially restore growth defect of sla1Δ cells . Thus , our results suggest that Bzz1 and Rvs167 have an antagonistic function to Sla1 and can act as Las17 disassembly factors . 9 Figure 2 : Bzz1 and Rvs167 regulate NPF association with the coat in absence of Sla1 .

B ) Bzz1 and Rvs167 perturb Las17 association to the plasma membrane in a Sla1 - dependent fashion . In LatA treated sla1Δ cells , Las17 - eGFP forms persistent ( blue ) and transient ( pink ) patches at the plasma membrane as well as cytoplasmic patches ( green ) . Data from 2 to 6 experiments per strain was pooled together . The total number of cells analyzed is indicated by n . The time lapses analyzed had a duration of 4 minutes 50 seconds and a frame rate of 10 seconds . C ) Spot growth assay . Cells were grown 48 hours at 30 ℃ . All cells express Las17 - eGFP and Abp1 - mCherry endogenously . Abbreviations : S = sla1Δ , B = bzz1Δ and R = rvs167 ( SH3Δ ) . 10 Las17 / Vrp1 positioning along the invagination axis is regulated by the Abp1 SH3 domain The antagonistic relationship between Sla1 and Bzz1 / Rvs167 suggests that different SH3 domain interactions with Las17 can modify each other . Abp1 , the SH3 protein of the actin module , assembles before Rvs167 and the Bzz1 SH3A interaction . An indication for potential SH3 crosstalk is the synthetic lethality of Abp1 and Sla1 mutants ( Holtzman et al . , 1993 ; Haynes et al . , 2007 ) . Abp1 has an N - terminal actin - binding domain and a C - terminal SH3 domain . First , we tested whether the Abp1 SH3 domain mediates Abp1 assembly . Abp1 ( SH3Δ ) - eGFP formed apparently normal plasma membrane - associated patches like Abp1 - eGFP , but also motile patches that were not associated with the plasma membrane ( fig . 3A ) . Furthermore , we could observe bigger Abp1 ( SH3Δ ) - eGFP structures that looked like clusters of patches . Hence , deletion of the Abp1 SH3 domain affected Abp1 localization . We analyzed the centroid movement and lifetimes of Abp1 - eGFP and Abp1 ( SH3Δ ) - eGFP patches that were associated with the plasma membrane ( fig . 3B ) . The deletion of its SH3 domain did not affect Abp1 assembly , but slowed down Abp1 disassembly dynamics relative to full length Abp1 . We could observe a similar phenotype for the actin module proteins , Sac6 and Cap1 , in abp1 ( SH3Δ ) cells ( fig . 3B ) . Thus , it is likely that the Abp1 SH3 domain does not regulate Abp1 disassembly specifically , but generally affects actin network disassembly dynamics . Similar to Abp1 ( SH3Δ ) , the coat proteins , Sla1 and Pan1 , also formed cytoplasmic patches and clusters in abp1 ( SH3Δ ) cells ( fig . 3C ) . That is reminiscent of disassembly defects reported for Ark1 , Prk1 and Inp52 mutant cells ( Cope et al . , 1999 ; Sekiya - Kawasaki et al . , 2003 ; Stefan et al . , 2005 ; Toret et al . , 2008 ) . Deletion of the Abp1 SH3 domain strongly inhibited Ark1 , Prk1 and Inp52 patch formation ( fig . 3C ) , in agreement with previous reports ( Fazi et al . , 2002 ; Stefan et al . , 2005 ) . In Ark1 , Prk1 and Inp52 mutant cells many endocytic proteins fail to disassemble from the newly made vesicle and thereby inhibit further trafficking steps ( Toret et al . , 2008 ) . The cytoplasmic patches and clusters of Abp1 , Sla1 and Pan1 in abp1 ( SH3Δ ) cells may reflect a similar vesicle trafficking blockage . 11 Figure 3 : The Abp1 SH3 domain recruits coat disassembly factors and mediates actin disassembly dynamics .

C ) Top : Coat proteins form cytosolic clusters in abp1 ( SH3Δ ) cells . Bottom : Deletion of the Abp1 SH3 domain inhibits recruitment of the coat disassembly regulators Ark1 , Prk1 and Inp52 . Pictures of representative cells are single frames . Scale bar : 2 μm 12 The Abp1 SH3 interactions therefore regulate the endocytic machinery post - vesicle scission , in particular for vesicle uncoating and actin disassembly . To investigate potential Abp1 SH3 functions prior to scission , we analyzed Rvs167 - eGFP patches in WT and abp1 ( SH3Δ ) cells . Rvs167 is a scission marker and altered Rvs167 assembly dynamics reflect defects in invagination growth and / or scission ( Kukulski et al . , 2012 ; Picco et al . , 2015 ) . In WT cells , Rvs167 assembled for around 5 seconds , then molecule numbers rapidly dropped and simultaneously the patch centroid moved quickly inward ( fig . 4A ) , which correlates with vesicle scission . Rvs167 patch movement in abp1 ( SH3Δ ) cells suggests that the final invagination size was similar to WT cells ( fig . 4A ) . However , vesicle scission was delayed and occurred 3 seconds later in the mutants . Furthermore , like coat and actin module proteins ( fig . 4B & C ) , Rvs167 also formed aberrant cytoplasmic structures in abp1 ( SH3Δ ) cells . We then analyzed patch dynamics of the NPF module proteins Las17 , Vrp1 , Myo5 and Aim21 in WT and abp1 ( SH3Δ ) cells . All four proteins formed cytosolic patches , similar to the actin patch and coat proteins ( fig . 4B & C ) , suggesting that NPFs might promote actin nucleation at cytosolic patches and thereby enhance actin disassembly defects even further . Regarding endocytic patches at the plasma membrane , Myo5 and Aim21 patch lifetimes were around 3 to 4 seconds longer in the mutant than in WT cells ( fig . 4B ) , similar to the delay in vesicle scission . Also Vrp1 and Las17 lifetimes were longer in abp1 ( SH3Δ ) than in WT cells ( fig . 4C ) . On average , Vrp1 had a lifetime of around 20 seconds and Las17 of around 30 seconds in WT cells . In abp1 ( SH3Δ ) cells , lifetimes were about 8 seconds longer for both Vrp1 and Las17 . Furthermore , Las17 and Vrp1 patches formed non - motile patches in WT cells . Strikingly , however , in abp1 ( SH3Δ ) cells , membrane - associated Las17 and Vrp1 patches were motile at the end of their lifetimes ( fig . 4C ) . This indicates a defect in Las17 and Vrp1 association to the invagination base and to the myosins which form non - motile patches in both WT and abp1 ( SH3Δ ) cells ( fig . 4B ) . De - localization of the LVC from the myosins effectively splits the actin nucleation promoting complex . Association of proteins to blocked vesicles might reduce the pool of proteins available for endocytosis , affecting protein assembly dynamics in abp1 ( SH3Δ ) cells . This could explain the extended lifetimes of Rvs167 , Aim21 , Myo5 , Vrp1 and Las17 at endocytic sites in these cells . However , the mechanism causing Las17 and Vrp1 patch movement in abp1 ( SH3Δ ) cells remains unclear . The Abp1 SH3 domain could 13 directly or indirectly modify upstream regulators of Las17 and Vrp1 like Sla1 , mediate simultaneous interaction partners like Myo5 , or promote downstream interactions with Bzz1 and Rvs167 .

Scale bar : 2 μm . Kymograph length : 36 seconds . Lsb3 and Bbc1 SH3 domain - dependent recruitment Our data shows that Bzz1 SH3 domains regulate Bzz1 assembly ( fig . 1 ) . Recruitment of Rvs167 and Myo5 is also mediated by their SH3 domains , as reported previously ( Sun et al . , 2006 ; Menon & Kaksonen , 2021 ) . The Myo3 SH3 domain likely acts similarly to the paralogous Myo5 , recruiting Myo3 . In contrast , Sla1 ( Sun et al . , 2015 ) and Abp1 ( fig . 3A & B ) do not appear to use their SH3 14 domains for their own recruitment to endocytic sites . We aimed to characterize the remaining SH3 domains of Lsb3 / 4 and Bbc1 in regard to protein recruitment . We focused on Lsb3 as a proxy for the Lsb3 / 4 paralogs due to issues with endogenous tagging of Lsb4 ( Dewar et al . , 2002 ; Urbanek et al . , 2015 ) . Deletion of the Lsb3 SH3 domain reduced Lsb3 patch intensities strongly but did not prevent patch formation entirely ( fig . 5A ) . In LatA - treated cells , both Lsb3 and Lsb3 ( SH3Δ ) formed patches ( fig . 5A ) . Hence , Lsb3 recruitment seems to be actin - independent with two recruitment routes , one via its N - terminal domain and one via the SH3 interaction . In the case of Bbc1 , the deletion of its SH3 domain also reduced protein patch intensities and increased diffuse cytosolic signals ( fig . 5A ) . Furthermore , we could observe a reduction in the number of patches per cell for Bbc1 ( SH3Δ ) compared to Bbc1 ( fig . 5B ) . Upon LatA treatment , Bbc1 formed patches but Bbc1 ( SH3Δ ) did not ( fig . 5A & B ) . Thus , the Bbc1 SH3 domain promotes Bbc1 recruitment in an actin - independent fashion while the rest of Bbc1 has actin - dependent interactions . Taken together , Lsb3 and Bbc1 each have SH3 domains that regulate their own protein recruitment to endocytic sites , similarly to the SH3 domains of Myo5 , Rvs167 and Bzz1 . Figure 5 : The Lsb3 and Bbc1 SH3 domain regulate Lsb3 and Bbc1 recruitment , respectively . A ) Patch formation of Lsb3 , Lsb3 ( SH3Δ ) , Bbc1 and Bbc1 ( SH3Δ ) in LatA treated cells . Scale bar : 2 μm . B ) Mean number of Bbc1 and Bbc1 ( SH3Δ ) patches per cell . 15 Discussion Spatio - temporal regulation of the LVC by the SH3 network Sla1 , Myo5 and Bbc1 are established regulators of the LVC ( Rodal et al . , 2003 ; Kaksonen et al . , 2005 ; Sun et al . , 2006 ; Feliciano & Di Pietro , 2012 ; Weinberg & Drubin , 2012 ; Mund et al . , 2018 ; Picco et al . , 2018 ) . We found that the SH3 domain proteins Bzz1 , Rvs167 and Abp1 are also regulators of the LVC at endocytic sites , emphasizing the central nature of the dynamic SH3 PPI network . The complexity of the SH3 PPI network has hampered the understanding of its function in regulating endocytosis . We propose three different perspectives on the SH3 domain - mediated dynamic regulation of the LVC . Together with previous studies our results suggest roles for SH3 domains in temporal coordination ( fig . 6A ) , spatial coordination ( fig . 6B ) and a dynamic network coordination of LVC regulation ( fig . 6C ) at endocytic sites . The LVC is initially recruited to endocytic sites before actin assembly occurs . The initial assembly of the LVC is regulated by Sla1 . Sla1 has three SH3 domains ( SH3A , SH3B and SH3C ) . The Sla1 SH3A and SH3B recruit Las17 by binding a central part of the Las17 proline - rich region ( Feliciano & Di Pietro , 2012 ; Sun et al . , 2015 ) . During actin assembly , the Myo5 SH3 domain interacts with Vrp1 and Myo5 regulates actin together with the LVC ( Sun et al . , 2006 ) . Simultaneously , Bbc1 inhibits excessive recruitment of Las17 to the periphery of the NPF ring structure ( Mund et al . , 2018 ) . Concurrent with these activities , the Abp1 SH3 domain regulates LVC localization along the invagination axis ( fig . 4 ) . As Bbc1 and Abp1 mediate LVC positioning within the endocytic machinery , we consider them “spatial regulators” of the LVC . Eventually , at the final stage of the actin phase , formation of new actin filaments slows down just prior to vesicle scission and correlates with LVC disassembly ( Picco et al . , 2018 ) . Our data indicates that Bzz1 and the Rvs167 SH3 domains coordinate LVC disassembly from endocytic sites ( fig . 2 ) . . Spatial regulation of the LVC might support the disassembly regulation by Bzz1 and Rvs167 . Furthermore , there may be a smooth change from assembly to disassembly regulation , in particular as Sla1 and Bzz1 appear to be in a binding competition ( fig . 1 ) . In conclusion , the LVC undergoes different phases of regulation . These regulatory 16 phases coordinate LVC recruitment , positioning of the LVC within the endocytic machinery and finally disassembly the LVC . SH3 domains have an intrinsic specificity and different SH3 domains preferentially bind different targets ( Tong et al . , 2002 ; Tonikian et al . , 2009 ) . However , swapping of SH3 domains , even within one protein , influences those SH3 domains’ specificity ( Dionne et al . , 2021 ) . Hence , molecular context defines SH3 interactions , too , and the molecular context is constantly changing during endocytic site progression . In a flat membrane scenario , Sla1 inhibits Bzz1 SH3 interactions that promote Bzz1 assembly during the later actin phase ( fig . 1 ) . Interactions of Bzz1’s F - BAR domain with the plasma membrane may affect Bzz1 SH3 competition with Sla1 , perhaps in a membrane composition - or curvature - dependent fashion ( Takano et al . , 2008 ; Rao et al . , 2010 ; Stanishneva - Konovalova et al . , 2016 ) . In addition to membrane curvature , invagination growth exposes Bzz1 to a number of proteins that have changed their positions relative to each other . We suspect that these architectural changes of the endocytic machinery during invagination growth affect SH3 interactions ( fig . 6B ) . During invagination growth , the LVC and Bzz1 are located at the invagination base but Sla1 is associated with the invagination tip ( Weinberg & Drubin , 2012 ) . This physical distancing could perturb Sla1 interactions and consequently change Sla1 - Bzz1 competition dynamics . In addition , Rvs167 assembles at the invagination neck close to the LVC , which is where Sla1 is located until the start of membrane invagination ( Picco et al . , 2015 ) . Rvs167 may interfere with Sla1 interactions and cooperate with Bzz1 to regulate LVC disassembly ( fig . 2 ) . The interplay of membrane curvature and relative changes in protein positions change endocytic sites from favoring Sla1 SH3 domain interactions to favoring Bzz1 and Rvs167 SH3 domain interactions . At the same time , Myo5 , Bbc1 and Abp1 regulate the LVC , too . While Sla1 , Bzz1 and Rvs167 are located on the inside of the LVC ring , Myo5 , Bbc1 and Abp1 assemble outside of it ( Mund et al . , 2018 ) . The spatial regulators Bbc1 and Abp1 are positioned like a barrier around the LVC ( fig . 6B ) , potentially regulating SH3 interactions that depend on LVC ring geometry . The LVC moves from its normal position in abp1 ( SH3Δ ) cells ( fig . 4 ) , maybe because it remains bound to Sla1 . The displacement of the LVC could allow it to escape from Bzz1 - and Rvs167 - mediated disassembly , explaining slow LVC disassembly in abp1 ( SH3Δ ) cells . In conclusion , 17 molecular context seems to affect SH3 interactions with the LVC and might provide feedback mechanisms for LVC regulation . Temporal ( fig . 6A ) and spatial ( fig . 6B ) aspects of LVC regulation by SH3 proteins imply that the SH3 interactions change dynamically during the progression of endocytosis ( Figure 6C ) . Initially , Sla1 interacts with the LVC . At this stage the Bzz1 PRM and SH3B promote Bzz1 recruitment . Sla1 competes with the Bzz1 SH3A , effectively inhibiting its interactions with the LVC ( fig . 1 ) . With the start of the actin phase , however , the SH3 interactions network becomes bigger and more complex . Myo5 and Bbc1 regulate the LVC but also interact with each other ( Mochida et al . , 2002 ) . The LVC and the myosins mediate the formation of a branched actin network , which recruits Abp1 . The Abp1 SH3 domain recruits Ark1 and Prk1 ( fig . 3 ) ( Fazi et al . , 2002 ) , leading to disassembly of the Sla1 / Pan1 complex . Effectively , the circle closes and the network becomes a self - regulating process based on negative feedback . The Ark1 / Prk1 - mediated disassembly of the Sla1 / Pan1 complex in combination with Sla1 moving away from the LVC , probably reduces the importance of Sla1 interactions when Rvs167 and Inp52 interactions occur ( Menon & Kaksonen , 2021 ) . The coat disassembly factor Inp52 would down - regulate any residual Sla1 interaction even further . Due to the reduced Sla1 - mediated inhibition , Bzz1 and Rvs167 could promote LVC disassembly . Subsequently , actin nucleation ends and LVC - dependent proteins dissociate from endocytic sites . This dynamic SH3 interaction network appears to self - regulate by feedback mechanisms . Such a tangled system may be important to allow adaptation to changes in cellular physiology or environmental conditions and could be a major reason for the remarkable robustness of endocytosis . 18 Figure 6 : Conclusions and models about LVC regulations by SH3 domains in yeast endocytosis .

We can now compare the endocytic SH3 domains in regard to their function as recruitment factors . As depicted in table 1 , Sla1 and Abp1 do not use their SH3 domains for their own recruitment . However , these two proteins are known to recruit other endocytic components via their SH3 domains ( Fazi et al . , 2002 ; Stefan et al . , 2005 ; Feliciano & Di Pietro , 2012 ; Sun et al . , 2015 ) . In contrast , Lsb3 / 4 , Bzz1 , Bbc1 , Myo3 / 5 and Rvs167 use their SH3 domains to regulate their own recruitment ( fig . 1 & 5 ) ( Sun et al . , 2006 ; Urbanek et al . , 2015 ; Menon & Kaksonen , 2021 ) . For this group of SH3 proteins there is so far no evidence that they would recruit other proteins using their SH3 domains . As SH3 domains typically have only one binding site , it is likely that one SH3 domain can fulfill only one recruitment function at a time . Thus , the SH3 domains are either recruiting their own protein or another protein , but not both . This type of recruitment specificity might be a useful generalization for understanding the functions of SH3 domains in PPI networks , such as the human one with hundreds of SH3 proteins .

This work was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation ( grant 310030B _ 182825 ) and by the NCCR Chemical Biology funded by the SNSF . Methods Strains , media and plasmids Strains were created via homologous recombination with PCR cassettes , and by mating and sporulation . EGFP - tagging , deletions and truncations were confirmed by PCR , substitutions by sequencing . All fluorescently tagged genes are expressed endogenously . Live cell imaging Sample preparation Yeast cells were grown to OD600 between 0 . 3 and 0 . 8 at 24 ºC with shaking in Synthetic Complete medium without L - Tryptophan ( SC - TRP ) . 40 μl of cells were added to a coverslip coated with Concanavalin A . After 5 to 10 minutes of incubation , cells were washed with fresh SC - TRP medium , 40 μl of fresh SC - TRP medium was added and the cells were transferred to the microscope . For DMSO or Latrunculin A 21 ( LatA ) treatment , cells were instead washed with SC - TRP medium containing 0 . 2 mM DMSO or LatA and 40 μl of DMSO or LatA medium was added . After 15 minutes of incubation , cells were washed again with DMSO or LatA medium , 40 μl of DMSO or LatA medium was added and the cells were transferred to the microscope . TIRF microscopy and analysis TIRF microscopy images were acquired using the Olympus IX83 wide - field microscope equipped with a 150x 1 . 45 oil objective and an ImageEM X2 EM - CCD camera ( Hamamatsu ) controlled by the VisiView software ( Visitron Systems ) . For illumination of GFP - and mCherry - tagged proteins , a 488 nm and 561 nm laser were used and the laser angles were controlled by the iLas2 system ( Roper Scientific ) . The emission light went through a dichroic Di03 - R488 / 561 - t1−25 × 36 filter set ( Semrock Brightline ) and was split using the W - view Gemini system ( Hamamatsu ) . TIRF microscopy data was background subtracted with a median filter using ImageJ ( Schneider et al . , 2012 ) . Spatially and temporarily clearly distinguishable endocytic patches were manually selected with the round selection tool in ImageJ and the fluorescence intensity over time was measured in both color channels . These fluorescence profiles included background signals from before and after the endocytic event . The data was analyzed by a custom - made script using Python 3 controlled by the Jupyter Notebook ( Van Rossum & Drake , 2009 ; Kluyver et al . , 2016 ) . First , the data was normalized over the integral of the fluorescence intensity based on Simpson’s rule . Second , the signals were time - aligned by cross - correlating the Abp1 - mCherry signals . Third , the median fluorescence intensity and median absolute deviation adjusted by a factor for asymptotically normal consistency was calculated . Fourth , the median intensities were normalized between 0 and 1 and errors were accordingly propagated . The maximum was set to 1 and the average background intensity was set to 0 . To obtain an accurate estimation of the background signal , the local minima and maxima of the median signals after the endocytic event were averaged . For the identification of these local minima and maxima , the first derivative of the median signals was estimated by convolution with an 11 - point Savitzky - Golay filter . 22 Epi - fluorescence microscopy and analysis Epi - fluorescence microscopy images were acquired using the Olympus wide - field microscope IX81 equipped with a 100× 1 . 45 objective and an ORCA - ER CCD camera ( Hamamatsu ) . As illumination source an X - CITE 120 PC ( EXFO ) metal halide lamp was used . The excitation and emission light when imaging EGFP - and mCherry - tagged proteins were filtered through an U - MGFPHQ and U - MRFPHQ filter set ( Olympus ) , respectively . Images were processed in ImageJ ( Schneider et al . , 2012 ) . Images were corrected for background fluorescence using the rolling ball algorithm of ImageJ and movies were in addition corrected for photobleaching using the simple ratio algorithm of ImageJ . For particle detection and tracking , the Particle Tracker ( Sbalzarini and Koumoutsakos , 2005 ) of the MosaicSuite was used . Average trajectories were obtained as described previously ( Picco et al . , 2015 ) . Trajectory plots were generated using Python 3 controlled by the Jupyter Notebook ( Van Rossum & Drake , 2009 ; Kluyver et al . , 2016 ) .
