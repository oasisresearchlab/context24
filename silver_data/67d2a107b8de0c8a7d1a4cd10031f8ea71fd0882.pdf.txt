Membrane levels of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 were estimated by analyzing images of lawns of plasma membranes labeled with fluores - cent probes specific for PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . The specific PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 signal was enriched in submicrometer - sized clusters . In parallel patch - clamp experimentsonintactcells , wemeasuredthesecretionofcatecholamines . Overexpressionofphosphatidylinositol - 4 - phosphate - 5 - kinase I (cid:1) , or infusion of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 through the patch pipette , increased the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 level in the plasma membrane and potentiated secretion . Expression of a membrane - targeted inositol 5 - phosphatase domain of synaptojanin 1 eliminated PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 from the membrane and abolished secretion . An inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol - 3 kinase , 2 - ( 4 - morpholinyl ) - 8 - phenyl - 4H - 1 - benzopyran - 4 - one , led to a tran - sient increase in the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 level that was associated with a potentiation of secretion . After prolonged incubation , the level of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 decreasedandsecretionwasinhibited . KineticanalysisshowedthatchangesinPI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levelsledtocorrelatedchangesinthesizeoftwo releasable vesicle pools , whereas their fusion kinetics remained unaffected . We conclude that during both short - and long - term manip - ulations of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 level secretion scales with plasma membrane PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 content and that PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 has an early effect on secretion by regulating the number of vesicles ready for release . Key words : exocytosis ; phosphatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - bisphospate ; chromaffin cell ; phosphatidylinositol 4 - phosphate 5 - kinase ; plasma - lemmal microdomains ; LY294002 Introduction Neuroendocrine exocytosis is a highly regulated process com - prising translocation of secretory vesicles to the plasma mem - brane ( docking ) , the formation of an exocytotic machinery be - tween vesicles and membrane ( priming ) , and , finally , fusion resulting in the release of the vesicular contents into the extracel - lular space . The fusion of large dense - core vesicles ( LDCVs ) in chromaffin cells is often used to study the basic concepts of exo - cytosis ( Rettig and Neher , 2002 ) . In chromaffin cells , it was found that an ATP - dependent priming step precedes the ATP - independent Ca 2 (cid:1) - triggered fu - sion step ( Holz et al . , 1989 ) . Additional experiments revealed that the presence of phosphatidylinositides , but not of phospholipase C cleavage products , is necessary for Ca 2 (cid:1) - dependent exocytosis in chromaffin cells ( Eberhard et al . , 1990 ) . A screening of cyto - plasmic factors required for ATP - dependent priming in PC12 cells identified two enzymes involved in phosphoinositide me - tabolism : phosphatidylinositol transfer protein ( PITP (cid:2) ) ( Hay and Martin , 1993 ) and phosphatidylinositol 4 - phosphate 5 - kinase ( PI4P5K ) ( Hay et al . , 1995 ) . Because PI4P5K uses ATP to synthesize phosphatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - bisphospate [ PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ] , a role for PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in exocytosis was hypothesized ( Hay et al . , 1995 ; Martin et al . , 1997 ) . Later , it was found that the overex - pressed pleckstrin homology domain of phospholipase C - (cid:3) 1 ( PH - PLC (cid:3) 1 ) , which specifically binds PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , localized to the plasma membrane and inhibited Ca 2 (cid:1) - dependent exocytosis ( Holz et al . , 2000 ) . Olsen et al . ( 2003 ) used capacitance measure - ments in pancreatic (cid:4) - cells and showed that infusion of phospha - tidylinositol 4 - phosphate [ PI ( 4 ) P ] or PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 increased the size of the readily releasable pool ( RRP ) of vesicles . Recently , Aikawa and Martin ( 2003 ) demonstrated that overexpression of a consti - tutively active ARF6 mutant caused redistribution of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and PI4P5KI (cid:1) from plasma membrane to endosomal mem - branes and inhibited LDCV secretion . The above studies indicate that PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is intimately in - volved in exocytosis of LDCVs . One idea is that PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 recruits ReceivedSept . 10 , 2004 ; revisedJan . 24 , 2005 ; acceptedJan . 24 , 2005 .

On the other hand , a recent in vitro study showed that binding of synaptotagmin 1 , the Ca 2 (cid:1) sensor for exocytosis , to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - containing membranes via its C2B domain increased the speed of insertion of synapto - tagmin 1 side chains into that membrane after the addition of Ca 2 (cid:1) ( Bai et al . , 2004 ) . It was suggested that changes in the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 level could regulate release rates , which would imply PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in regulating the last Ca 2 (cid:1) - dependent step in exocyto - sis . Thus , it remains to be established where exactly in the exocy - tosis pathway PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is required . We have used several independent approaches to upregulate and downregulate PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels in bovine chromaffin cells ( BCCs ) . The effects of these manipulations were assessed semi - quantitatively by detection of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in isolated plasma mem - brane lawns by exogeneous green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) - tagged PH domain . In parallel experiments , exocytosis of LDCVs was monitored by patch - clamp capacitance measurements and amperometry . Wediscoveredthatthesizeofthereleasablevesicle pools , but not their release kinetics , scales with the amount of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in the plasma membrane , no matter whether PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is regulated acutely or chronically , suggesting that PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is a key physiological regulator of chromaffin cell secretion . Materials and Methods Antibodies , expression constructs , and virus generation . Mouse monoclo - nal antibody was used to detect PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( Assay Design , Ann Arbor , MI ) , and the primary antibody was visualized using cyanine 5 ( Cy5 ) - conjugated goat anti - mouse secondary antibody ( Jackson ImmunoRe - search , West Grove , PA ) . Unless indicated otherwise , the chemicals used were purchased from Sigma ( Taufkirchen , Germany ) . For protein expression , pET28a - His 6 - GFP - PH - PLC (cid:3) 1 was generated by subcloning the fusion construct between the PH domain from PLC (cid:3) 1 and enhanced GFP ( EGFP ) ( attached to the C - terminal end of the PH domain ) into pET28a . The triple mutation K30A , K32A , W36N of GFP - PH - PLC (cid:3) 1 , which does not bind to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , was generated by PCR and also cloned into pET28a . For the construction of a vector encoding the proteins tagged with monomeric red fluorescent protein ( mRFP ) at their N terminus , mRFP containing an initiator , ATG , but no stop codon was amplified from pmRFP ( a gift from Dr . H . - D . So¨ling , Go¨ttingen , Ger - many ) and inserted into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 ( In - vitrogen , San Diego , CA ) yielding pcmRFP . The coding sequences for PI4P5KI (cid:1) and the membrane - tagged 5 - inositol phosphatase domain of synaptojanin 1 ( IPP1 - CAAX ) ( Krauss et al . , 2003 ) were inserted into pcmRFP . For infection of BCCs , the viral constructs pSFV1 - PI4P5KI (cid:1) - IRES - GFP and pSFV1 - IPP1 - CAAX - IRES - GFP were generated : a viral pSFV1 vector ( Invitrogen ) was modified by the introduction of an inter - nal ribosome entry site from poliovirus and EGFP . PI4P5KI (cid:1) was cut from pGFP - C1 - PI4P5KI (cid:1) ( Krauss et al . , 2003 ) and subcloned into the modified pSFV1 using the Pme I site . IPP1 - CAAX was cut from pcDNA - IPP1 - CAAX ( Krauss et al . , 2003 ) and cloned into the modified pSFV1 usingthe Bam HI / Pme Isites . Thesequencesofallconstructswereverified by DNA sequencing . Virus production was performed as described pre - viously ( Ashery et al . , 1999 ) . Expression and purification of wild - type and mutated GFP - PH - PLC (cid:3) 1 . Escherichia coli BL21 ( DE3 ) cells transformed with wild - type ( wt ) or mutated pET28a - His 6 - GFP - PH - PLC (cid:3) 1 were grown in Luria broth me - diumcontaining50 (cid:5) g / mlkanamycinat37°CtoanOD 600 of0 . 8 . Protein expression was induced by the addition of 0 . 5 m M isopropyl - 1 - thio - (cid:4) - D - galactopyranoside for 4 h . The cell pellet was resuspended in 35 ml of ice - cold PBS containing 1 m M phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and incu - bated with lysozyme for 10 min on ice . After sonification , 1 % Triton X - 100 and 1 % 3 - [ ( 3 - cholamidopropyl ) dimethylammonio ] - 1 - propane - sulfonatewereadded . Themixturewasincubatedforanother10minand then centrifuged at 25 , 000 (cid:2) g for 15 min . The supernatant was supple - mented with 20 m M imidazol and incubated with nickel – nitrilotriacetic acid – agarose ( Qiagen , Hilden , Germany ) for 2 h at 4°C . The collected beads were washed twice with PBS buffer containing 20 m M imidazol , once with PBS buffer containing 40 m M imidazol , and once with K - Glu buffer ( in m M : 120 potassium glutamate , 20 potassium acetate , 20 HEPES , and4MgCl 2 , pH7 . 2 ) . Thebeadsweresubsequentlyresuspended in 2 ml of K - Glu buffer supplemented with 10 m M EDTA , and after 30 min , thrombin ( 30 U ; Sigma ) was added and incubated for at least 4 h . The supernatant containing His 6 - tag - cleaved protein was dialyzed twice against 0 . 5 L K - Glu buffer supplemented with 1 m M dithiothreitol . Fi - nally , the dialyzed solution was sedimented in a microcentrifuge ( 14 , 000 rpmfor30minat4°C ) , andtheproteinconcentrationofthesupernatant was determined by the method of Bradford . The protein was analyzed by SDS - PAGEandCoomassiestaining . Twobandsweredetected : oneofthe appropriate size ( (cid:3) 75 % of the total protein amount ) and another signif - icantly smaller . Only the bigger band associated specifically with PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 liposomes . Liposome binding with wt and triple mutated GFP - PH - PLC (cid:3) 1 . Lipo - somes containing 70 % phosphatidylcholine , 20 % phosphatidylethano - lamine , and 10 % PI or 10 % PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 were prepared as described previ - ously ( Rohde et al . , 2002 ) . Fifty microliters of each liposome suspension ( 100 (cid:5) g ) were incubated in cytoplasmic buffer ( in m M : 25 HEPES , pH 7 . 2 , 25KCl , 2 . 5magnesiumacetate , and150potassiumglutamate ) with3 (cid:5) g of wt or mutated GFP - PH - PLC (cid:3) 1 for 15 min at room temperature in a final volume of 100 (cid:5) l . The mixture was centrifuged at 35 , 000 (cid:2) g for 1 h at 4°C . The pellet was resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer . Cell culture and transfection . The primary culture of BCCs was pre - pared as described previously ( Nagy et al . , 2002 ) . The neuroendocrine cell line PC12 ( clone 251 ) was maintained and propagated as described previously ( Lang et al . , 1997 ) . Viral infection was performed on cultured BCCs 12 – 36 h after plating . Transfection of PC12 cells with wt and mu - tated GFP - PH - PLC (cid:3) 1 , mRFP - PI4P5KI (cid:1) , and mRFP - IPP1 - CAAX was performed as described previously ( Lang et al . , 1997 ) . Electrophysiological and electrochemical measurements . Whole - cell patch - clamp capacitance , amperometry , flash photolysis of caged cal - cium , and intracellular Ca 2 (cid:1) measurements were performed as de - scribed previously ( Nagy et al . , 2002 ) . PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 isolated from bovine spinal cord was obtained from Calbiochem ( Darmstadt , Germany ) and dissolved in the pipette - filling solution by sonification for 15 min on ice . During the recordings , the BCCs were maintained in extracellular solu - tion ( 145 m M NaCl , 2 . 8 m M KCl , 2 m M CaCl 2 , 1 m M MgCl 2 , 10 m M HEPES , and 2 mg / ml D - glucose , pH 7 . 20 , 305 mOsm / kg ) . In the experi - ments with short - term 2 - ( 4 - morpholinyl ) - 8 - phenyl - 4H - 1 - benzopyran - 4 - one ( LY294002 ) application , alocalperfusionsystemwasused . Kinetic analysiswasperformedfittingindividualcapacitancetraceswithatriple - exponential function as described previously ( Nagy et al . , 2004 ) . The amplitudes and time constants of the two faster exponentials define the size and release kinetics of the slowly releasable pool ( SRP ) and the RRP , respectively , whereas the slowest exponential was included to correct for the sustained component of release . Because the time constant of the sustained component is too slow to be measured accurately in this way , this third exponential was not used directly . Instead , we subtracted the amplitudes of the fast and slow burst from the total amount of secretion during 5 s and calculated the linear rate of sustained release . Statistical testing of amplitudes and time constants of the kinetics components was performed by the nonparametric Mann – Whitney U test . Each experi - mental condition has been compared with control cells obtained from the same cell preparations . The values given represent the mean (cid:4) SEM .

Cells were used for experiments 24 – 36 h after plating . For chromaffin cells , membrane sheets were made byplacingthecoverslipinto150mlofice - coldsonicationbuffer ( 120m M potassium glutamate , 20 m M potassium acetate , 20 m M HEPES , 2 m M ATP , 100 (cid:5) M GTP , 4 m M MgCl 2 , 4 m M EGTA , 6 m M Ca - EGTA , and 300 n M [ Ca 2 (cid:1) ] free , pH 7 . 2 , 310 mOsm / kg ; bubbled with N 2 for 30 min ) in a round glass beaker with a final volume of 300 ml . A coverslip with at - tached cells was centered 12 mm under the sonication tip ( 2 . 5 mm ) , and 2558 • J .

Apart from chromaffin cells , the primary culture con - tained a low number of other cell types , mainly endothelial cells and erythrocytes . However , the membrane sheets generated from these cells differed in their size and level of staining for syntaxin 1 , so that they were easily recognized and excluded from analysis . Membrane sheets from PC12 cells were generated as described previously ( Avery et al . , 2000 ) . Fluorescence on plasma membrane sheets generated from BCCs and PC12 cells . In experiments with recombinant GFP - PH - PLC (cid:3) 1 , freshly prepared membrane sheets from BCCs or PC12 cells were incubated for 10 or 15 min with 3 (cid:5) M GFP - PH - PLC (cid:3) 1 in K - Glu buffer with 3 % BSA . Subsequently , the sheets were washed for 100 s in K - Glu buffer and fixed for at least 2 h in 4 % paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature . For visualizing the plasma membrane , 1 - ( 4 - trimethyl - amoniumphenyl ) - 6 - phenyl - 1 , 3 , 5 - hexatriene ( TMA - DPH ) or 1 , 1 (cid:5) - dihexadecyl - 3 , 3 , 3 (cid:5) , 3 (cid:5) - tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate ( DiIC 16 ) ( Molecular Probes , Eugene , OR ) were used . Immunofluorescence on PC12 membrane sheets was performed as described previously ( Lang et al . , 2001 ) . All samples were examined with an Axiovert 100 TV fluorescence microscope ( Zeiss , Oberkochen , Germany ) with a 100 (cid:2) , 1 . 4 numerical aperture plan achromate objective using the appropriate fluorescence filters ( excitationfilterG365 , BS395andemissionfilterLP420wereused forTMA - DPHdye ; excitationfilterBP480 / 40 , BS505andemissionfilter BP 527 / 30 were used for GFP ; excitation filter BP 590 / 60 , BS 660 and emission filter BP 662 / 76 were used for Cy5 dye ) . Throughout all exper - iments , the focal position of the objective was controlled using a low - voltage piezo translater driver and a linear variable transformer displace - ment controller ( Physik Instrumente , Waldbronn , Germany ) . The images were taken with a back - illuminated frame transfer CCD camera ( 2x512x512 - EEV chip , 13 (cid:2) 13 (cid:5) m pixel size ; Princeton Instruments , Trenton , NJ ) with a magnifying lens ( 1 . 6 (cid:2) or 2 . 5 (cid:2) Optovar ) to avoid spatial undersampling by the larger pixels . Digital image analysis was performed using MetaMorph software ( Universal Imaging , West Ches - ter , PA ) . The size of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 clusters was estimated by fitting one - dimensional Gaussians to a line - scan profile through the center of se - lected fluorescent spots as described previously ( Lang et al . , 2001 ) . The point - spread function was identified by fitting two - dimensional Gauss - ian functions to the fluorescence intensity profile of 220 nm beads ( Tet - raSpeck microfluorospheres ; Molecular Probes ) and was determined to be 246 nm . To perform comparative quantitation of fluorescence inten - sity , plasma membrane sheets were identified in the TMA - DPH images . A 3 . 3 (cid:2) 3 . 3 (cid:5) m ( 40 (cid:2) 40 pixels ; 1 pixel corresponding to 81 . 25 nm ) region of interest was defined on the randomly selected membrane and transferred to the other channels . The fluorescence intensity was quan - tified by measuring the average intensity of the area . The local back - ground was measured in the area outside the membrane sheets and sub - tracted . Foreachcondition , atleast30membranesheetswereanalyzedin each experiment . Intensity values are given as mean (cid:4) SEM . Images for display are presented on a linear intensity scale , usually scaled between the minimal and maximal value present in the region of interest . In some cases , the maximal value was decreased , resulting in local image satura - tion , to make finer structures ( microdomains ) visible . Results A spatially resolved assay for PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in the plasma membrane of chromaffin and PC12 cells We aimed at comparing the amount of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in the plasma membrane with LDCV secretion from chromaffin cells as mea - sured electrophysiologically . To measure PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels in the plasma membrane , we adapted a microscopic assay that has re - cently been developed for PC12 cells and fibroblasts to measure the amount and spatial distribution of plasma membrane con - stituents ( Lang et al . , 2001 , 2002 ) . Cells grown on coverslips are disrupted by a brief ultrasonic pulse , leaving behind lawns of plasmamembranewiththecytosolicfacebeingdirectlyaccessibletoexternalprobes . In addition , some intact cells are usually still present . To visualize PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , we incubated membrane sheets prepared from PC12 cells with exogenously added PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - binding PH domain of PLC (cid:3) 1 fused to GFP ( GFP - PH - PLC (cid:3) 1 ) that was previously shown to bind selectively to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( Staufferetal . , 1998 ; Va´rnaiandBalla , 1998 ) . Weobservedstrong labeling of membrane sheets ( Fig . 1 B ) , whereas intact cells were not labeled ( data not shown ) , in agreement with the general find - ing that PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is only present in the inner plasma membrane leaflet . The labeling exhibited a punctate staining pattern distrib - uted over the entire plasma membrane . To confirm the integrity of the membrane sheets , the sheets were visualized using TMA - DPH , a lipophilic styryl dye ( Fig . 1 A ) . Punctate labeling by GFP - PH - PLC (cid:3) 1 was detected in areas where the TMA - DPH mem - brane staining was uniform ( Fig . 1 C , D ) , revealing that it was not attributable to local increases in the membrane area ( e . g . , attrib - utable to infoldings ) . Similar results were obtained when the lipid dye DiIC 16 instead of TMA - DPH was used ( data not shown ) . Several experiments were performed to ensure that GFP - PH - PLC (cid:3) 1 labeling of the membrane sheets can be used to detect PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . First , we constructed a triple mutant of GFP - PH - PLC (cid:3) 1 deficient in PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding ( K30A , K32A , W36N GFP - PH - PLC (cid:3) 1 ) . In contrast to the wt GFP - PH - PLC (cid:3) 1 , this mutant did not bind PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 liposomes ( Fig . 1 E , F ) . When applied to membrane sheets , no labeling by the triple mutant was observed ( (cid:6) 0 . 3 % of the wt signal ) ( Fig . 1 G , H ) . Next , we compared label - ing with a PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - specific antibody to GFP - PH - PLC (cid:3) 1 stain - ing . When applied to the same membrane sheets simultaneously , the two PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ligands showed similar staining patterns ( Fig . 1 I , K ) , which partly overlapped . Finally , we tested whether bind - ing of GFP - PH - PLC (cid:3) 1 competes with antibody binding . When PC12 cell membrane sheets were incubated with a mixture of anti - PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 antibody and increasing amounts of GFP - PH - PLC (cid:3) 1 , a gradual decrease of anti - PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 antibody labeling was observed ( Fig . 1 L ) . Hence , we conclude that GFP - PH - PLC (cid:3) 1 is a reliable reporter of plasmalemmal PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . An alternative re - porter would be the anti - PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 antibody , but to avoid probe - mediated PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 clustering or coalescence of clusters , we pre - ferredtousedGFP - PH - PLC (cid:3) 1 , whichbindsPI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 withaone - to - one stochiometry . GFP - PH - PLC (cid:3) 1 labeling was very stable in membrane sheets : the level of fluorescent probe remained unchanged for at least 30 min after staining , also in experiments in which membrane sheets were not fixed after the addition of GFP - PH - PLC (cid:3) 1 . We esti - mated the size of the clusters by fitting Gaussians to a line - scan profile through the center of selected fluorescent puncta ( Lang et al . , 2001 ) . That method gave a size of 306 (cid:4) 13 nm after correc - tion for point - spread function ( n (cid:7) 60 puncta ) . The clustering of the GFP - PH - PLC (cid:3) 1 signal was disrupted when cholesterol was extracted from the membrane using methyl - (cid:4) - cyclodextrin ( data not shown ) . Clustering was evident in most experiments , but uniform GFP - PH - PLC (cid:3) 1 staining was observed in some cells , particularly on sheets with very intense TMA - DPH staining . In the above , we used the easily accessible PC12 cells and the previously published method for membrane sheet generation to define the basal properties of the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 assay . However , for electrophysiological experiments , we preferred to use chromaffin cells , because chromaffin cells , in contrast to PC12 cells , display fast secretion of LDCVs on the millisecond time scale as detected electrophysiologically . This property allows us to address the question at which step PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 acts in the secretory cascade . We therefore developed a membrane sheet assay for chromaffin cells by enhancing cell attachment by poly - L - lysine coating of the glass coverslips and modifying the sonication procedure ( see Materials and Methods ) . When membrane sheets from chromaffin cells Milosevicetal . • PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 LevelRegulatesChromaffinCellSecretion J . Neurosci . , March9 , 2005 • 25 ( 10 ) : 2557 – 2565 • 2559 were incubated with GFP - PH - PLC (cid:3) 1 , we again observed a punctate distribution of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in the membrane ( see Fig . 5 C ) . The specificity of the GFP - PH - PLC (cid:3) 1 sig - nal in chromaffin cells was verified by re - peating the experiments in Figure 1 , G and H , which gave indistinguishable results . The estimated size of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 clusters in BCCs was comparable with the one calcu - lated in PC12 cells ( 319 (cid:4) 12 nm ; n (cid:7) 50 puncta ) . Indeed , in every aspect tested , we obtained similar results with the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 assay in PC12 cells and chromaffin cells . We conclude that PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 can be spe - cifically detected in isolated membrane sheets by the addition of exogeneous GFP - PH - PLC (cid:3) 1 . Hence , we used this method to semiquantitatively evaluate the effect of manipulations on plasma membrane PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 content . An increase in the plasma membrane PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 level potentiated LDCV secretion in chromaffin cells PI4P5KI (cid:1) is preferentially expressed in the nervous system and concentrated at syn - apses where it has been implicated in the synthesis of the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 pool relevant for membrane trafficking ( Wenk et al . , 2001 ) . We first examined the consequences of ex - pressing PI4P5KI (cid:1) fused to mRFP ( mRFP - PI4P5KI (cid:1) ) in PC12 cells . For con - venience , we used PC12 cells for these measurements , because they can be trans - fected more easily than BCCs , without the need for a viral transfection system , and because all tested properties of GFP - PH - PLC (cid:3) 1 staining were very similar between PC12 cells and BCCs . Plasma membrane sheets were generated from transfected as well as from nontransfected cells and incu - bated with GFP - PH - PLC (cid:3) 1 . Expressed mRFP - PI4P5KI (cid:1) was localized to the plasma membrane ( Fig . 2 B ) , in agreement withpreviousobservations ( Ariokaetal . , 2004 ) . Thefluorescence quantification revealed nearly threefold higher GFP - PH - PLC (cid:3) 1 binding to membrane sheets from transfected cells ( Fig . 2 A – C ) . A similar increase in plasmalemmal PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 was detected using anti - PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 antibody instead of GFP - PH - PLC (cid:3) 1 ( data not shown ) . These data show that overexpression of PI4P5KI (cid:1) in - creased the level of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in the plasma membrane . Note that the GFP - PH - PLC (cid:3) 1 labeling of the membrane sheets in Figure 2 A appears more uniform than in Figure 1 B ; this impression is caused by the scaling of the image to represent the very different fluorescence intensities present . After rescaling according to the intensity present within either sheet , both sheets showed inho - mogeneous staining , although in the expressing cells , the inho - mogeneities no longer appeared punctate ( data not shown ) . When we compared the staining for GFP - PH - PLC (cid:3) 1 ( in the green channel ) with the PI4P5KI (cid:1) signal ( in the red channel ) , we observed a significant correlation ( Pearson correlation coeffi - cient , r (cid:7) 0 . 65 ; p (cid:6) 0 . 0001 ) between the binding of GFP - PH - PLC (cid:3) 1 and the level of PI4P5KI (cid:1) overexpression ( Fig . 2 D ) . To achieve high efficiency of BCC transfection , we expressed PI4P5KI (cid:1) and GFP ( as an expression marker ) using Semliki For - est virus ( SFV ) . Transfected cells were loaded via a patch pipette with the photolabile Ca 2 (cid:1) chelator nitrophenyl – EGTA and two Ca 2 (cid:1) - sensitive dyes that enable accurate Ca 2 (cid:1) measurements during the whole - cell patch - clamp experiments ( Voets , 2000 ) . Flash photorelease of caged calcium commonly increased the in - tracellular calcium concentration ( [ Ca 2 (cid:1) ] i ) from several hun - dred nanomolars to (cid:8) 10 (cid:5) M , which resulted in robust secretion assayed by the increase in membrane capacitance and ampero - metric current ( Fig . 3 A ) . Measured by capacitance increase , exo - cytosis in the cells overexpressing PI4P5KI (cid:1) was strongly en - hanced ( on average , 235 % ) compared with control cells . Larger amperometric currents from PI4P5KI (cid:1) - overexpressing cells re - vealed that this strong increase in capacitance was mediated by fusion of catecholamine - filled LDCVs . A similar increase was observed as a result of a second stimulation executed 100 s after the first one ( on average , 241 % ) . As described previously , BCC secretion elicited under these conditions consists of a burst phase Figure1 . PunctatePI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - specificstainingofPC12membranesheets .

In accordance with this model , we performed a kinetic analysis to determine the pool sizes ( the amplitudes of the exponential fits ) and fusion kinetics ( time constants of the exponential fits ) ( Nagy et al . , 2004 ) . The sizes of both releasable pools , the RRP and the SRP , were in - creased by approximately a factor of 2 in PI4P5KI (cid:1) - overexpressing cells ( Fig . 3 A ) . Also , the sustained component of release , which measures the refilling of the pools , was signifi - cantly increased ( Fig . 3 A ) . In contrast , the time constants of RRP and SRP fusion did not differ significantly between control and PI4P5KI (cid:1) - overexpressing cells ( Fig . 3 A ) . These data indicate that the increased PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 level had an influence on the size and refilling of the releasable pools but not on their rate constant of fusion with the plasma membrane under conditions of elevated calcium concentrations . We wanted to investigate whether a short - term ( acute ) in - crease in PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 would also modulate secretion . Therefore , we applied 5 (cid:5) M PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 suspension through the patch pipette ( Olsen et al . , 2003 ) . Cells loaded with PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 exhibited a large increase in secretion , both as a result of the first ( on average , 275 % increase ) ( Fig . 3 B ) and the second ( on average , 270 % in - crease ) stimulus . Further kinetic analysis revealed that PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - loaded cells had a significantly larger exocytotic burst than the control , and , as in the case of PI4P5KI (cid:1) - overexpressing cells , this was a result of a twofold increase in the size of the RRP and the SRP in the absence of a change in fusion kinetics ( Fig . 3 B ) . The increase in the rate of sustained release from PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - loaded cells was also highly significant ( Fig . 3 B ) . Given that intracellular application of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 affects exocytosis , we inspected whether PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 could be incorporated in the plasma membrane when incubated in vitro with plasma membrane sheets generated from BCCs and PC12 cells . The sheets were incubated with different concentrations of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 suspension and subsequently reacted with GFP - PH - PLC (cid:3) 1 . We detected fluorescent particles attached to the membrane sheets , but plasmalemmal PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 was not significantly increased , indicating that insertion of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 was not very efficient in this in vitro experiment ( data not shown ) . Nevertheless , we expect that in an in vivo situation , cytoplasmic proteins such as PITP would mediate insertion of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 into the membrane . Figure2 .

Neurosci . , March9 , 2005 • 25 ( 10 ) : 2557 – 2565 • 2561 Together , these data demonstrate that increasing the amount of plasmalemmal PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 over control conditions caused a higher level of LDCV secretion and that this increase is attribut - able to a larger number of primed vesicles . Deprivation of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 from plasma membrane abolished LDCV secretion in chromaffin cells We next asked whether normal secretion in resting chromaffin cells depends on the presence of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . To decrease the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 concentration in the plasma membrane , we overex - pressed a PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 degrading enzyme , the membrane - targeted inositol 5 - phosphatase domain of synaptojanin 1 ( IPP1 - CAAX ) fused to mRFP ( mRFP - IPP1 - CAAX ) ( Krauss et al . , 2003 ) in PC12 cells . Plasma membrane sheets were generated from these as well as from nontransfected cells and reacted with GFP - PH - PLC (cid:3) 1 . The fluorescence quantification revealed that almost no signal could be detected on the membrane sheets generated from mRFP - IPP1 - CAAX - expressing cells ( on average , 5 . 2 % of control values ) ( Fig . 4 C ) . Similar data were obtained using an anti - PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 antibody ( data not shown ) . Thus , overexpression of mRFP - IPP1 - CAAX almost completely deprived PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 from PC12 cell plasma membrane . We constructed SFV encoding IPP1 - CAAX and GFP and transfected BCCs in primary culture . Ca 2 (cid:1) - induced secretion from BCCs expressing IPP1 - CAAX was nearly abolished , when evaluated as both a capacitance change and as amperometric cur - rent ( Fig . 4 A ) . The total secretion over the first 5 s recording period added up to (cid:3) l3 % of that seen in control cells . Also , a second stimulation (cid:3) 2 min after the first one failed to elicit se - cretion ( Fig . 4 B ) . We therefore conclude that PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is essen - tial for Ca 2 (cid:1) - induced LDCV secretion . Because of the low amount of remaining secretion , a kinetic analysis was not possible . Next , we examined whether the Ca 2 (cid:1) - induced secretion in BCCs overexpressing IPP1 - CAAX could be rescued by loading the cells with 5 (cid:5) M PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 through the patch pipette . In ap - proximately one - quarter of the experimental cells , we managed to rescue secretion up to normal levels , whereas in approximately three - quarters of the cells , this was not the case ( data not shown ) , probably because of the continuous action of IPP1 - CAAX to break down PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . The previous two sections show that the resting level of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane is interme - diate between the levels that would result in minimal and maxi - mal secretion . Thus , the level of secretion can be changed in both directions by a change in PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , making PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 a likely key physiological regulator of chromaffin cell secretion . Dual effect of LY294002 on the plasma membrane PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 level and LDCV secretion in chromaffin cells Besides PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , other phosphoinositides may have a role in secretion ( Cremona and De Camilli , 2001 ) . Based on the use of phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) inhibitors , several studies suggested PI3K and 3 - phosphorylated phosphatidylinositides in regulating exocytosis and synaptic transmission ( Chasserot - Golaz et al . , 1998 ; Hong and Chang , 1999 ; Rizzoli and Betz , 2002 ; Cousin et al . , 2003 ) . Therefore , we examined the effect of the most commonly used PI3K inhibitor , LY294002 , on catechol - amine secretion in BCCs . Acute application of 100 (cid:5) M LY294002 was performed through a local perfusion system . Measured by capacitance increase , the first Ca 2 (cid:1) - releasing stimulus applied 4 minafterthebeginningofLY294002applicationshowedstronglyenhancedsecretionintreatedcells ( on average , 235 % ) ( Fig . 5 A ) . The sizes of both the releasable pools were increased ; the rate of the sustained component was , on average , higher in LY294002 - treated cells , but this was not statistically significant . The time constantsforfusionofthereleasablepoolswereindistinguishablefromcontrolcells ( Fig . 5 A ) . The second flash given 100 s after the first one also evoked an increased exocytotic response ( on aver - age , 242 % ) . These findings are surprising , because it was previ - ously shown that LY294002 inhibited secretion in chromaffin cells ( Chasserot - Golaz et al . , 1998 ) ; in that study , longer incuba - tion times were used . Therefore , we increased the preincubation time to 30 – 70 min and indeed this resulted in a 58 % reduction of secretion at the first stimulus and a 72 % reduction at the second one ( Fig . 5 B ) . Kinetic analysis revealed that the sizes of both releasable pools as well as the rate of sustained secretion were significantly decreased after prolonged application of LY294002 ( Fig . 5 B ) . Moreover , inspection of the time constants revealed no differences in fusion kinetics with respect to control for both the RRP and the SRP ( Fig . 5 B ) . We wanted to determine whether the effect of LY294002 could be accounted for by changes in the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 level . We therefore measured the corresponding PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels in plasma membrane sheets from BCCs ( Fig . 5C ) or PC12 cells treated with LY294002 for defined time periods . For both BCC and PC12 cell plasma membranes , a nearly twofold increase in GFP - PH - PLC (cid:3) 1 bindingwasobservedaftershort - termincubationwithLY294002 ( 3 – 5 min ) ( Fig . 5 D , data from BCC ; data from PC12 cells were similar ) . Prolonged incubation with LY294002 resulted in a (cid:3) 50 % decrease in GFP - PH - PLC (cid:3) 1 binding ( 30 – 60 min ) ( Fig . 5 D ) . We performed the same experiment with 100 (cid:5) M 2 - ( 4 - piperazinyl ) - 8 - phenyl - 4H - 1 - benzopyran - 4 - one ( LY303511 ) , an Figure 4 .

Therefore , we conclude that changes of the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 level in the plasma membrane were because of the specific activities of LY294002 . In conclusion , LY294002 has a biphasic effect on secretion : acute application leads to increased PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels and potenti - ation of secretion , whereas chronic application decreases PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels and inhibits secretion . Discussion By comparing secretion from chromaffin cells using electrophys - iological methods with inner membrane leaflet PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels using a membrane sheet assay , we have shown that the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 level determines the extent of chromaffin cell secretion . If PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is depleted from the plasma membrane by phosphatase overexpression or long - term LY294002 application , secretion is reduced . If PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels are increased by PI4P5KI (cid:1) overex - pression , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 infusion , or short - term LY294002 applica - tion , secretion is increased . This shows that ( 1 ) short - term ( acute ) and long - term ( chronic ) changes in PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels are equally effective at modulating secretion , therefore ( 2 ) the cells do not seem to compensate for a change in the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 level but rather use it as an input signal to determine the extent of secre - tion , and ( 3 ) in the normal , resting chromaffin cells the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 level is suboptimal , so that an increase can upregulate secretion . All of these features make PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 a potential key physiolog - ical regulator of secretion . Spatial distribution of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in the plasma membrane We wanted to develop methods for assay - ing plasma membrane PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels and distribution . In many studies , it is hard to distinguish between the roles of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and that of related phosphatidylinositides [ PI ( 4 ) P , PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ] on secretion . Like - wise , the question of the spatial distribu - tion of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in the membrane re - mains unresolved . The presence of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 domains has been proposed by several groups ( for review , see Caroni , 2001 ; Martin , 2001 ) . However , the results of overexpression studies using PH do - mains are diverse . In the first studies , a nearly uniform distribution over the plasma membrane was found ( Stauffer et al . , 1998 ; Va´rnai and Balla , 1998 ) . Some later studies that revealed local accumula - tions in plasma membrane “ruffles” ( Honda et al . , 1999 ; Botelho et al . , 2000 ; Tall et al . , 2000 ) were recently reinter - preted after the demonstration of colocal - ization with lipophilic membrane dyes , implying that the apparent PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 en - richments might have been local mem - brane infoldings ( van Rheenen and Jalink , 2002 ) . Va´rnai et al . ( 2002 ) found that an - other PH domain from the PLC - like pro - tein p130 did not become localized to the plasma membrane , although it showed se - lective binding to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in vitro . It was suggested that a proteinaceous factor con - tributes to the plasma membrane localiza - tion of GFP - PH - PLC (cid:3) 1 . However , the interpretation of expression studies is difficult , because the localization of a soluble protein in a living cell is determined by the relative affinities , amounts , and ac - cessibilities of all of the different ligands [ for PH - PLC (cid:3) 1 and PH - p130 , also the soluble inositol ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) triphosphate ] , the concentra - tion of the overexpressed protein , and the way that the cell responds to the sequestering of the ligands . We therefore favored to detect plasmalemmal PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 by an in vitro assay in which exogeneous probe was added to isolated membrane sheets , in which only a single high - affinity ligand is present [ PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ] . Our experiments show that PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 bind - ing of PH - PLC (cid:3) 1 is necessary for membrane binding , that PH - PLC (cid:3) 1 competes with an anti - PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 antibody for plasma membrane binding , and that the assay could detect chronic as well as acute increases in PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . The following features char - acterize the spatial organization of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in the membrane sheets of chromaffin and PC12 cells : ( 1 ) PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 was apparently enriched in abundant submicrometer - sized clusters ; and ( 2 ) cho - lesterol was necessary for the organization of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 clusters . Our GFP - PH - PLC (cid:3) 1 clusters in the plasma membrane did not correspond to local increases in membrane area , as shown by TMA - DPH or DiIC 16 staining ( Fig . 1 A – D ) . Being approximately punctate , these domains appear similar to those that were de - Figure5 . DualeffectofLY294002ontheplasmamembranePI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levelandLDCVsecretioninchromaffincells .

( 2000 ) to colocalize with PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - binding GAP43 , MARCKS , and CAP23 ( the GMC proteins ) in PC12 cells . It should be pointed out that the punctate staining of GFP - PH - PLC (cid:3) 1 can be interpreted in several ways : the most obvious is that it reflects a punctate PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 distribution in the plasma mem - brane . However , it is also possible that it reflects varying accessi - bility of the probe to plasmalemmal PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , caused by steric hindrance attributable to endogeneous PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - associated pro - teins . In this case , the punctate labeling may reflect an inhomo - geneous protein distribution in the membrane , rather than an inhomogeneous PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 distribution . PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and exocytosis We found that PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 positively modulates secretion in neu - roendocrine cells , in agreement with previous studies ( Eberhard et al . , 1990 ; Holz et al . , 2000 ; Aikawa and Martin , 2003 ; Olsen et al . , 2003 ) . A number of different manipulations of the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 level all showed that PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 stimulates exocytosis by increasing the number of vesicles residing in the releasable vesicle pools and increasing the sustained rate of release , which is assumed to be indicative of an increased refilling rate of the releasable pools . This is in agreement with the finding that PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 infusion into pancreatic (cid:4) - cells increases the RRP size ( Olsen et al . , 2003 ) . Overexpression of PI4P5KI (cid:1) , the kinase that generates PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , caused an increase in the plasmalemmal PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 level , whereas overexpression of a membrane - tagged PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 phospha - tase , IPP1 - CAAX , eliminated plasmalemmal PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and secre - tion . Thus , the balance between generation and degradation rates of plasmalemmal PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 directly regulates the extent of LDCV se - cretion from chromaffin cells . The implication is that PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is morethananobligatory - permissivefactorthatneedstobepresentat sufficient levels in order for exocytosis to occur . Rather , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels are limiting secretion in the control situation , and therefore changes in this level regulate secretion directly and dynamically . A time - dependent correlation between the plasma membrane PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 level and primed vesicle pool size was found in our experiments with LY294002 . Two previous studies addressed the effect of LY294002 on neuroendocrine secretion . When applied for 30 min , LY294002 did not significantly affect secretion in permeable PC12 cells ( Martin et al . , 1997 ) . However , Chasserot - Golaz et al . ( 1998 ) described a dose - dependent inhibition of cat - echolamine secretion in chromaffin cells after a 30 min incuba - tion with LY294002 and implied that PI3K is involved in secretion . In agreement with the latter study , we found that pre - incubation ( 30 – 70 min ) with LY294002 inhibited secretion . However , in addition we discovered that short - term application of LY294002 ( up to 6 – 7 min ) caused a more than twofold in - crease in the number of fused vesicles . Taking advantage of our PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 assay , we found that the short - term application of LY294002 induced a transient increase in the level of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in the plasma membrane , whereas a longer preincubation decreased it significantly . Together with the overexpression studies , this correlation suggests that the effect of LY294002 on secretion is mediated through a change in the plasmalemmal PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 level . However , the pathway through which this biphasic change in the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 level comes about was not identified by our experi - ments . LY294002 is an inhibitor of PI3K that uses PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 as a substrate to generate PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ( Vlahos et al . , 1994 ) . PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 may affect the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 metabolism by activating PLC (cid:1) ( Bae et al . , 1998 ) . However , LY294002 also inhibits PI4K , which gener - ates PI ( 4 ) P , the precursor for PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( Downing et al . , 1996 ; Sorensen et al . , 1998 ) . Therefore , LY294002 inhibits at least two pathways of phosphatidylinositide metabolism , which could lead to complex time - dependent effects on the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 level . In ad - dition , LY294002 affects other kinases ( e . g . , casein kinase 2 ) ( Da - vies et al . , 2000 ) , which may have indirect effects on PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 metabolism . Whatever the pathway for LY294002 action , our data show that the effect of this inhibitor on secretion may be accounted for by changes in PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels , without the need to invoke a direct role for 3 - phosphorylated phosphatidylinositides in exocytosis . In addition , this experiment shows that the size of the primed vesicle pools in chromaffin cells can respond to tran - sient changes in the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 level on the minute time scale . This is consistent with a function of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 as an acute regulator of secretion . Several proteins involved in exocytosis specifically bind PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 : the family of synaptotagmin proteins ( Schiavo et al . , 1996 ) , Ca 2 (cid:1) - dependent activator protein for secretion ( CAPS ) ( Loyet et al . , 1998 ) , Mint ( Okamoto and Sudhof , 1997 ) , and rab - philin 3 ( Chung et al . , 1998 ) . Which of these interactions are physiologically relevant remains to be explored . The recent finding that synaptotagmin 1 binds to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - containing membranes via itsC2Bdomain , andtherebyincreasesitsspeedofinsertionintothat membrane , led to the suggestion that changes in the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 level could regulate release rates ( Bai et al . , 2004 ) . We found that under conditions of increased or decreased PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels , the releasable vesicle pool sizes were changed but the release rate constants were not . It was previously shown that fusion of vesicles from the RRP is dependent of synaptotagmin 1 ( Voets et al . , 2001 ) and that the re - lease rate constant can be modified by synaptotagmin 1 mutation ( Sørensen et al . , 2003 ) . Therefore , the simplest explanation for our findings is that PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding of synaptotagmin 1 is not rate limiting for fusion triggering under our conditions . An interesting possibility would be that PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding of synaptotagmin 1 is involved in upstream reactions . Additional studies are required to answer this question . In conclusion , we report that PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is in a position to be a key physiological regulator of the size and the refilling rate of the primed vesicle pools but not the fusion rate constants . As a secre - tion regulator , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 has several advantages over proteins with the same task : plasmalemmal PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 molecules could re - cruit and activate a large number of different proteins to create a local environment in which exocytosis takes place . At the same time , the rapid enzymatic production and degradation of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 allows the cell to remain flexible : by changing the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 level , physiological function can be modified within seconds or minutes without the need for protein synthesis or degradation .
