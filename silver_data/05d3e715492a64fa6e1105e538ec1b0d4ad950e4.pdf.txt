Published online 28 May 2009 ; doi : 10 . 1038 / nprot . 2009 . 65 The knowledge of molecular mechanisms underlying the adhesive and mechanical properties of cell surface - associated molecules is a key to understanding their functions . In this context , single - molecule force spectroscopy ( SMFS ) has recently offered new opportunities for probing the adhesion and mechanics of polysaccharides and proteins on live cells . Here we present a protocol that we have used to analyze polysaccharide chains of different nature on the bacterium Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG . We describe procedures ( i ) for functionalizing atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) tips with Pseudomonas aeruginosa – I or concanavalin A lectins , ( ii ) for stretching speciﬁc polysaccharide molecules on live bacteria using SMFS with lectin tips and ( iii ) for mapping the localization , adhesion and extension of individual polysaccharide chains . We also discuss data treatment , emphasizing how to gain insight into the elasticity of the stretched macromolecules using the extended freely jointed chain model . Even though the presented protocol is for L . rhamnosus , it can be easily modiﬁed for other cell types . For users having expertise in the ﬁeld , the entire protocol can be completed in about 5 d . INTRODUCTION Polysaccharides on bacterial surfaces have long been recognized for their roles in mediating cellular recognition , bacterial adhesion and bioﬁlm formation 1 , 2 . Although much progress has been made in elucidating the chemical structures of cell wall associated poly - saccharides , their adhesive and conformational properties remain poorly understood at the molecular level 3 , 4 . The single - molecule manipulation toolkit Several assays are available to manipulate single - molecules , includ - ing atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) , the biomembrane force probe ( BFP ) , optical and magnetic tweezers 4 – 8 . All these assays have in common that they exert forces on molecules , either by mechanical transducers which directly apply or sense forces as in BFPand AFM , or by external magnetic or photon ﬁelds acting on molecules from a distance , as in optical and magnetic tweezers 6 . Unlike mechanical transducers , optical and magnetic tweezers are non - contact tech - niques which are able to non - invasively manipulate biomolecules in solution , thus including within living cells 7 . These methods have proved very useful for measuring small forces , such as those associated with the rupture of receptor - ligand bonds . A drawback of optical tweezers is that biological systems may be subject to laser damage . Magnetic tweezers do not suffer from this problem , are more selective and are particularly well suited for manipulations in complex environments , such as the interior of cells . By contrast , BFP is a surface technique which offers the advantage that the transducer sensitivity can be tuned in operation to measure a wide range of forces at various biological interfaces , including on cell surfaces 5 . Remarkably , owing to its tiny scanning force - probe AFM is the only force - measuring technique which can simultaneously localize and manipulate single molecules on live cells 4 , 8 . This is an essential feature for cell - surface research as biomolecular interac - tions are linked to structures in living cells . Of note , in silico single - molecule experiments using molecular - dynamics simulations have recently become a powerful tool complementing and guiding in vitro single - molecule force experiments , revealing new insight into the elastic response of biomolecules 9 . Elastic behavior of proteins and polysaccharides The past decade has witnessed tremendous progress in applying AFM - based single molecule force spectroscopy ( SMFS ) to measure the mechanical properties of proteins and polysaccharides in vitro 8 – 17 . In a typical SMFS experiment , the deﬂection of the AFM cantilever is recorded at a given x , y location as a function of the vertical displacement of the scanner , i . e . , as the tip is pushed towards the sample and then retracted . This results in a cantilever deﬂection vs scanner displacement curve , which can be trans - formed into a force - distance curve using appropriate corrections . Upon retracting the tip from the surface , the curve often shows a non - linear elongation force , reﬂecting stretching of ﬂexible molecules on the tip and on the sample , until the adhesion ‘pull - off’ force is observed ( Fig . 1 ) . The elongation force may be understood as follows . At small displacements , reduction in the number of conformations gives rise to entropic elasticity - forces , whereas at large extensions , tension in the molecular backbone may lead to enthalpic elasticity - effects ( bond deformation , rupture of intramolecular hydrogen bonds and even conformational changes of the entire molecule ) . Besides force - distance curves , the force - volume mode produces two - dimensional arrays of force - distance measurements over speciﬁed areas , thus providing spatially - resolved information on the distribution of elongation and adhesion events . The force resolution of the AFM is in ﬁrst approximation limited by the thermal noise of the cantilever , which , in turn , is determined by its spring constant . In addition , the resonance frequency , the quality factor and the measurement bandwidth can also signiﬁcantly contribute 18 . Therefore , for single - molecule force measurements , best results are generally obtained puo r G gn i h s il bu P e r u t a N 9002 © n a t u r e p r o t o c o l s / m o c . e r u t a n . www / / : p tt h NATURE PROTOCOLS | VOL . 4 NO . 6 | 2009 | 939 PROTOCOL with cantilevers exhibiting small spring constants ( 0 . 01 N m (cid:1) 1 ) and short lengths ( o 50 m m ) , because they exhibit lower force - noise . Two models are often used to quantitatively describe the elasti - city of ﬂexible macromolecules , i . e . , the worm - like chain ( WLC ) and the freely jointed chain ( FJC ) models 19 . The WLC model describes the polymer as an irregular curved ﬁlament , which is linear on the scale of the persistence length l p , a parameter which represents the stiffness of the molecule . Hence , molecules with low persistence length have a tendency to form coils . Extension is limited by the contour length L c of the molecule , i . e . , the length of the linearly extended molecule without stretching the molecular backbone . In this model , the force F versus extension x is given by F ð x Þ ¼ k b T = l p ½ 0 : 25 ð 1 (cid:1) x = L c Þ (cid:1) 2 + x = L c (cid:1) 0 : 25 (cid:2) ð 1 Þ where , k b is the Boltzmann constant , T the absolute temperature . In the FJC model , the polymer is considered as a series of rigid , orientationally independent statistical ( Kuhn ) segments , connected through ﬂexible joints . The segment length , referred to as the Kuhn length l k , is a direct measure of the chain stiffness and is related to the contour length by L c ¼ nl k . The extension x can be expressed as a function of the pulling force F as x ð F Þ ¼ L c ½ coth ð Fl k = k b T Þ (cid:1) k b T = Fl k (cid:2) ð 2 Þ An extended FJC ( FJC + ) model has been developed in which Kuhn segments can stretch and align under force . The polymer consists of a series of n elastic springs characterized by a segment elasticity , k s . The extension x versus the pulling force F is then given by x ð F Þ ¼ L c ½ coth ð Fl k = k b T Þ (cid:1) k b T = Fl k (cid:2) ½ 1 + nF = k s L c (cid:2) ð 3 Þ In AFM studies , proteins that behave like continuous deformable rods are generally well described by the WLC model 11 , 12 , whereas polysaccharides that behave more as series of loosely connected segments can be described by the FJC + model 10 , 13 . Functionalizing AFM tips Stretching experiments are generally conducted using silicon or silicon nitride AFM tips . Although convenient , this approach is generally not suited for cell experiments . Picking up speciﬁc molecules in a complex cellular - environment requires functionali - zation of the tip with well - deﬁned ligands ( for detailed reviews on functionalization methods ( see refs . 20 , 21 ) ) . As detailed in the PROCEDURE 22 , a good strategy to covalently anchor proteins on tips is to use a polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) crosslinker , which provides motional freedom and prevents denaturation ( Fig . 1a ) . Tips are ﬁrst modiﬁed with amino groups , further reacted with PEG linkers carrying benzaldehyde functions that are then directly attached to proteins through their lysine residues 23 – 25 . Another option is to use self - assembled monolayers of alkanethiols on gold tips 26 . Both the thiol and silane approaches make it possible to orientate the attached biomolecules via their C - terminal or N - terminal domains , by linking recombinant histidine - tagged proteins onto an AFM tip coated with nitrilotriacetate groups . In this procedure , we present AFM protocols to investigate the distribution and conformation of single - polysaccharide molecules on the probiotic bacterium Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG ( LGG ) 22 . We also compare the elasticity of the LGG polysaccharides with that of yeast mannoproteins 27 . These are the protocols we used to produce the results published in refs . 22 and 27 . However , these protocols are also applicable to a wide range of cells , not only microbes , but also animal cells 8 , 20 . Thus , this procedure should be useful to scientists working in the ﬁelds of biophysics , glycobiology , cell biology and microbiology , where experimental approaches are traditionally dominated by ensemble techniques . Overview of procedure The ﬁrst stage of the procedure , which is valid , whatever the cell type investigated , is functionalization of the AFM tips . The quality of the functionalization procedure is a key prerequisite for success - ful , reliable SMFS experiment 20 , 21 . When choosing a functionaliza - tion strategy , you should consider the following issues : ( i ) the force which immobilizes the lectins should be stronger than the lectin - sugar binding force ; ( ii ) the attached lectins should have enough mobility so that they can freely interact with complementary sugars ; ( iii ) the contribution of non - speciﬁc adhesion to the measured forces should be minimized and ( iv ) attaching lectins at low surface density is recommended in order to ensure single polysaccharide detection . In the procedure we describe below , AFM tips are ﬁrst functionalized with concanavalin A ( Con A ) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( PA - I ) lectins ( Fig . 1a ; Steps 1 – 9 ) , to detect speciﬁc polysaccharides containing mannose ( or glucose ) and galactose , respectively .

In buffered solutions , it is easy to maintain an applied force in the range of 100 – 500 pN . Owing to thermal drift , the applied force is to be readjusted between each recording . 17 | Localize a single - cell trapped into a pore , while increasing the image resolution ( Fig . 2a ) . 18 | Using a scan rate of B 1 m m s (cid:1) 1 , record a high resolution image of a region of interest ( Fig . 2b ) , i . e . , a region which is representative of the entire cell and which does not show scanning artefacts like streaks . m CRITICAL STEP Scan rates should typically be in the range of 0 . 5 – 2 m m s (cid:1) 1 . The scan rate should not be too fast when nanometer resolution is desired , because at fast scan rates the tip may not respond faithfully to nanoscale features . However , slow scan rates may cause sample damage when imaging soft surfaces . 19 | For SMFS , disengage the tip , change it with a lectin - modiﬁed tip ( either Con A or PA - I ) and then re - engage to localize the cell . m CRITICAL STEP In this delicate step , it is important to re - engage the functionalized tip almost at the same location as the bare tip , i . e . , ideally on top of the cell of interest , to minimize tip contamination . A good hint is to use an optical microscope to visualize both the tip and the cell during engagement . Such optically - guided AFM analysis will be easier to achieve on an integrated platform , such as the BioScope II ( Veeco ) . 20 | Record 50 consecutive force - distance curves at a single location ( Fig . 1b ) , then move to another spot 25 nm away . puo r G gn i h s il bu P e r u t a N 9002 © n a t u r e p r o t o c o l s / m o c . e r u t a n . www / / : p tt h 942 | VOL . 4 NO . 6 | 2009 | NATURE PROTOCOLS PROTOCOL m CRITICAL STEP To save time , we recommend checking whether the shape of consecutive force curves is reproducible and consistent with the stretching of polysaccharide chains ( Fig . 1b ) . ?

TROUBLESHOOTING Choosing the right method for functionalizing the tips ( Steps 1 – 9 ) Functionalization of AFM tips with lectins using well - controlled procedures is required for analyzing speciﬁc polysaccharides on cells . Methods that are poorly deﬁned or not appropriate will automatically yield data with poor reliability and reproducibility . We therefore recommend attaching lectins using either thiol or silane surface chemistry 20 , 21 . If a new protocol is used , it should be carefully developed and tested to provide strong attachment of the biomolecules at low - surface density , to guarantee sufﬁcient mobility and to inhibit unspeciﬁc adsorption . For every new system , the quality of the surface modiﬁcations should be assessed using ﬂuorescence or surface - analysis techniques . Are the cells living ? ( Step 15 ) Unlike animal cells , Gram - positive bacteria have mechanically strong cell walls . Thus , most LGG bacteria freshly harvested in the exponential phase are expected to be alive . It should however be noted that for animal cells and for some microbes , it may be critical to ensure that the cell investigated is still alive during the SMFS measurements . A general method to differentiate between live and dead cells is to use viability stains , i . e . , ﬂuorescent stains that probe the membrane integrity . A more direct approach is to introduce growth media into the AFM liquid cell after the force measurements , and to check whether the cell divides . puo r G gn i h s il bu P e r u t a N 9002 © n a t u r e p r o t o c o l s / m o c . e r u t a n . www / / : p tt h NATURE PROTOCOLS | VOL . 4 NO . 6 | 2009 | 943 PROTOCOL Recording single force - distance curves ( Step 20 ) The lifetime of a lectin tip may be very short because of tip contamination . When the sample is coated with loosely bound material , as often is the case with cell surfaces , the tip may be contaminated sometimes after recording one image or a few force curves . Identiﬁcation of this issue during the course of an experiment will help users to save time , while optimizing the quality of their data . A good trick to minimize this problem is to ﬁrst localize and visualize the cell of interest with an unmodiﬁed tip , before engaging a lectin tip . Then , record force curves immediately after the tip is engaged on a single spot and assess how the force behavior evolves with time and when moving from one spot to another . Another important point to avoid tip alteration is to trigger the maximum contact force to a few 100 pN . To probe single molecules , it may sometimes be useful not only to dilute the surface density of lectins on the tip , but also to modulate the contact force and the contact time between the tip and the cell . Another crucial issue is to identify whether the force curve characteristics , i . e . , elongation , adhesion and ruptures , are roughly consistent with the stretching of polysaccharide chains ( Fig . 1b ) . First , check that the curves show single or multiple adhesion events with a magnitude in the 25 – 100 pN range , which is expected for single lectin – sugar interactions . Second , elongation forces should be observed before each adhesion peaks , yielding rupture lengths up to 1 , 000 nm . If these features are not observed ( e . g . , huge adhesion forces or very short rupture distances ) , this could mean a ‘bad’ tip , resulting either from poor functionalization or from contamination . Restart the procedure with a fresh lectin - tip from Step 19 , if focusing is required on another cell , and varying the contact force and the contact time . If this does not help , restart the procedure with a fresh lectin - tip from Step 19 . If needed , focus on another cell , and vary the contact force and the contact time . As for statistics , we recommend to record several hundred curves on different cell - surface locations using different tips , including tips from independent batches . Also , the measurements should be repeated on different cells , including cells from independent cultures . It is to be noted that the total number of curves to record will very much depend on the reliability and reproducibility of the data ( adhesion forces , rupture distances and ﬁtting parameters ) . Recording force volumes ( Step 21 ) The force - volume mode may be used to map the spatial distribution of the polysaccharide chains . A crucial drawback though is the poor temporal resolution ( 4 10 min per ﬁle ) , which is much slower than biological timescales and may cause serious technical problems ( e . g . , drift and tip contamination ) . If these issues are encountered even when changing the tip or the cell , users may want to switch to dynamic recognition imaging , provided this option is available on their instrument , which offers the advantage that topography and recognition images are recorded within 1 min ( ref . 20 ) . However , this method should always be combined with local SMFS analyses , as it does not allow quantitative determination of forces . Speciﬁcity of the single molecule measurements ( Step 22 ) An important feature in SMFS is to show the speciﬁcity of the measured forces , which can be achieved by block experiments in which the recognition sites ( here , lectins ) are masked by adding free ligands ( here , monosaccharides ) . In the case of lectins , a more straightforward approach is to perform the measurements in the absence of Ca 2 + and Mn 2 + ions . Another elegant control is to use mutant cells that are deﬁcient in cell wall constituents ( here , polysaccharides ) 22 , 29 . Converting raw data into ‘force - distance’ curves ( Step 24 ) The AFM force curves are obtained by monitoring the cantilever deﬂection ( d ) as a function of the vertical displacement of the piezoelectric scanner ( z ) . The raw data is in fact a ‘voltage - displacement’ curve , which needs to be converted into a ‘force - distance’ curve using the following corrections . First , the sensitivity of the AFM detector , i . e . , the slope of the retraction curve in the region where tip and sample are in contact , is used to convert the voltage into a cantilever deﬂection ( d ) . This is only valid when the sample behaves like a hard surface , whereas for soft cell - surfaces like here the value obtained for the sensitivity may be incorrect because of sample deformation by the tip . Therefore , the sensitivity of the detector must be determined on a hard support , before or after the force measurements on cells . Second , the cantilever deﬂection is converted into a force ( F ) using Hooke’s law : F ¼ k (cid:3) d , where k is the cantilever spring constant . Third , the curve is ﬁnally corrected by plotting the force ( F ) as a function of the difference ( z – d ) . For hard samples , the zero separation distance ( or zero extension ) is simply determined as the position of the vertical linear part of the curve in the contact region . However , deﬁning the zero extension on deformable surfaces like cells is more delicate and can be done in different ways 30 . A convenient method ( used here ) is to assess the zero distance by extrapolating the linear contact region to zero force value . Addressing single - polysaccharide chains ? ( Step 25 ) How can we learn about the elasticity of the stretched polysaccharides ? Elongation forces should be well - ﬁtted with an extended ( FJC ) model , yielding Kuhn lengths l k and segment elasticities k s that are in the range of ( but not necessarily similar to ) those reported for well - deﬁned polysaccharides 10 , 13 . If the curves are not described with a FJC + model , it may be useful to test a WLC model , which could indicate that glycoproteins are stretched , rather than pure carbohydrates . The parameters l k and k s are intrinsic properties , which are expected to depend on the chemical and mechanical nature of the polymer , but should be puo r G gn i h s il bu P e r u t a N 9002 © n a t u r e p r o t o c o l s / m o c . e r u t a n . www / / : p tt h 944 | VOL . 4 NO . 6 | 2009 | NATURE PROTOCOLS PROTOCOL independent of its length . Thus , although the rupture ( or contour ) lengths of the polymer chains may show large variations , the measured l k and k s should show only small variations , indicating that mostly individual molecules of similar properties are being measured . Are we addressing single molecules ? If the functionalized tip is working properly , thus yielding adhesion events of 25 – 100 pN with rupture lengths of 100 – 1 , 000 nm , it is unlikely that a large number of polysaccharide molecules will adsorb at the same time on the tip with the same length so that they would give a single , discrete elongation event upon extension . Rather , differ - ent molecules are expected to give distinct events , as shown in Figure 1b . Yet , if there is evidence that multiple molecules are probed in parallel , it may be useful to vary the contact force and the contact time , and if the situation does not improve , restart with a fresh lectin - tip . ANTICIPATED RESULTS Microbial cell - surface polymers and appendages play major roles in controlling cell adhesion and bioﬁlm formation . For the ﬁrst time , SMFS measurements enable researchers to study the adhesion and mechanical properties of single polysaccharides and proteins directly on live cells 22 , 27 , 31 – 38 . Figures 1 and 2 show how we used the above protocols to analyze polysaccharide chains of different nature on L . rhamnosus GG ( LGG ) , with the following question in mind : what is the heterogeneity of the polysaccharides in terms of chemical nature , surface distribution and extension 22 ? We used Con A and PA - I - terminated tips to detect and stretch mannose / glucose - rich and galactose - rich polysaccharide molecules on LGG cells ( Fig . 1 ) . Force - distance curves recorded with Con A - tips ( Step 20 ) showed essentially single - adhesion events , along with elongation forces and rupture lengths ranging from 20 to 400 nm that were well - ﬁtted with a FJC + model . Adhesion forces of 56 ± 20 pN were observed , consistent with single Con A - mannose interactions . By contrast , the curves obtained with PA - I tips showed multiple adhesion peaks with much longer rupture distances , typically in the 100 – 1 , 000 nm range . This ﬁnding suggests that polysaccharides probed with Con A and PA - I tips were of different nature , i . e . , mannose / glucose - rich polysaccharide chains showing single rupture - forces with moderate extensions , and galactose - rich polysaccharide chains showing multiple ruptures and much longer extensions ( Fig . 1c ) . Although the nature of the polysaccharide detected with the Con A tip is currently unknown , the galactose - rich polysaccharides are thought to correspond to exopolysaccharides . We then mapped the localization , adhesion and extension of the individual polysaccharide chains on the LGG surface . First , the topography of single live cells could be imaged at high resolution ( Steps 16 – 18 ) , revealing wave - like structures likely attrib - uted to extracellular polysaccharides ( Fig . 2a , b ) . Using the force - volume mode ( Steps 21 and 26 ) , we obtained adhesion force maps both with Con A and PA - I tips , and we found that the distribution of the two polysaccharides was rather homogeneous and did not depend on the heterogeneous surface morphology ( Fig . 2c , e ) . Maps of polymer properties ( Step 27 ; Fig . 2d , f ) conﬁrmed the coexistence of two types of polysaccharides , i . e . , short mannose / glucose - rich polysaccharides and longer galactose - rich polysaccharides ( Fig . 1c ) . In addition , we found that the polysaccharide properties of the wild - type strain were markedly different from those of a mutant strain ( Fig . 3 ) , which was earlier shown to be impaired in adherence to gut epithelium , bioﬁlm formation and exopolysaccharide produc - tion , suggesting these molecules play a role in bacterial adhesion and in promoting beneﬁcial health effects . We also used a similar method to stretch single mannopro - teins , i . e . , highly glycosylated polypeptides that represent the main constituent of the yeast surface ( Fig . 4 ) 27 . Using Con A tips , individual mannan oligosaccharides were speciﬁcally picked up on Saccharomyces cerevisiae . Force - distance curves recorded across cell surfaces showed elongation forces and adhesion events with rupture distances in the 0 – 400 nm range ( Fig . 4a ) . Notably , elongation forces could not be described by a FJC + ( or FJC ) model , but were well ﬁtted with a WLC model , leading us to believe that not only oligosaccharides , but also polypeptide chains of the entire mannoproteins were stretched ( Fig . 4b ) . These data demonstrate that SMFS has a great potential for exploring the diversity of polysaccharides on cell surfaces and for understanding their role in cell adhesion . Lastly , we would like to stress that even though most com - mercial AFMs are user friendly and well - established methods puo r G gn i h s il bu P e r u t a N 9002 © n a t u r e p r o t o c o l s / m o c . e r u t a n . www / / : p tt h 1 , 000 b d a c 200 pN 0 pN 200 pN 0 pN 800 600 400 200 500 500 400 400 300 300 200 200 [ nm ] [ nm ] [ n m ] 100 100 0 0 500 500 400 400 300 300 200 200 [ nm ] [ nm ] 100 100 0 0 0 1 , 000 100 nm 100 nm 800 600 400 200 [ n m ] 0 Figure 3 | The CMPG5413 mutant strain impaired in cell adherence and polysaccharide production displays very different polymer properties .
