End User Software Engineering : CHI’2009 Special Interest Group Meeting Abstract End users create software whenever they write , for instance , educational simulations , spreadsheets , or dynamic e - business web applications . Researchers are working to bring the benefits of rigorous soft - ware engineering methodologies to these end users to try to make their software more reliable . Unfor - tunately , errors are pervasive in end - user software , and the resulting impact is sometimes enormous . This special interest group meeting will bring to - gether the community of researchers who are ad - dressing this topic with the companies that are cre - ating and using end - user programming tools .

Expressed this way , it seems obvious that the study of humans and pro - gramming should be a topic of HCI . Indeed , this area of study has a long history , and has appeared under many names , including “Software Psychology” [ 25 ] , “Psychol - ogy of Programming” [ 7 , 9 ] and “Empirical Studies of Programming” ( ESP ) . We define “end - user programmers” ( EUP ) as people who write programs , but not as their primary job func - tion — they write programs in support of achieving their main goal , which is something else , such as ac - counting , designing a web page , doing office work , sci - entific research , entertainment , etc . End - user pro - grammers generally use special - purpose languages such as spreadsheet languages or web authoring scripts , but some EUPs , such as chemists or other sci - entists , may learn to use “regular” programming lan - guages such as C or Java to achieve their programming goals . Two NSF workshops determined that end - user software is in need of serious attention [ 4 ] . The reasons are compelling . Our research shows that while there are about 3 million professional programmers in the United States , over 12 million people say they do program - ming at work , and over 12 million people use spread - sheets and databases , and thus may also be considered to be doing programming [ 24 ] ( see Figure 1 ) . The NSF reports that there are about 6 million scientists and engineers in the US , most of whom program as part of their jobs [ 19 ] . Unfortunately , however , errors are per - vasive in software created by end users . When the software that end users create is not dependable , there can be serious consequences for the people whose re - tirement funds , credit histories , e - business revenues , and even health and safety rely on decisions made based on that software . For example , a Texas oil firm lost millions of dollars in an acquisition deal through spreadsheet errors [ 22 ] . Two recent large collaborative efforts , one in the U . S . ( the EUSES Consortium http : / / eusesconsortium . org / ) , and one in Europe ( the Network of Excellence on End - User Development , http : / / giove . cnuce . cnr . it / eud - net . htm ) have produced a number of promising results in this area ( see , e . g . , [ 27 ] ) . Special Interest Group meetings at CHI’2004 [ 15 ] , CHI’2005 [ 16 ] , and CHI’2007 [ 18 ] , CHI’2008 [ 17 ] and the WEUSE series of workshops at ICSE’2005 [ 8 ] , CHI’2006 [ 6 ] , Dagstuhl 2007 ( see http : / / www . dagstuhl . de / 07081 ) and ICSE’2008 [ 1 ] , very successfully brought together re - searchers and companies interested in this topic . The special interest group ( SIG ) meeting at CHI’09 is designed to bring this community back together , as well as to introduce the area to others who are inter - ested in allowing users to create more correct software . Examples of Current Work A few End - User Software Engineering ( EUSE ) projects , some of which have been presented at CHI , are already successful . Here are just a few examples . The “Natural Programming” project at Carnegie Mellon University has been working for more than 10 years to make programming more “natural” , or closer to the way people think . Many studies were performed ( e . g . , [ 12 , 14 , 20 ] ) , and new programming languages [ 21 ] and environments were created . For example , Figure 2 shows a new “Why” - oriented technique for debugging CHI 2009 ~ Special Interest Groups April 4 - 9 , 2009 ~ Boston , MA , USA 2732 which lets users ask about program output [ 11 ] . New work focuses on how to enable interaction designers to be more creative when exploring interactive behaviors { Myers , 2008 # 1587 } . The “End - User Software Engineering” project involving researchers at Oregon State University and University of Washington aims to improve the reliability of soft - ware produced by end - user programmers . Some results have included “What You See Is What You Test” ( WYSIWYT ) integrated with fault localization [ 5 ] , semi - automated detection of erroneous combinations of units in spreadsheets ( Figure 3 ) [ 2 ] , and new methods for involving end users in the “debugging” of machine - learned programs ( Figure 4 ) [ 13 ] . The work empha - sizes research on how to engage users in end - user software engineering practices without detrimentally interrupting their problem - solving efforts . The Gender HCI Project [ 3 ] , a collaboration of Oregon State University and Drexel University , has the goal to support both males’ and females’ problem solving , es - pecially in end - user software development tasks . Our results show that females are less willing than males to try out and adopt software features that support testing and dataflow - oriented debugging , and further that male and female end - user programmers use different strate - gies when debugging [ 26 ] . Current work focuses on support for males and females in designing and reusing applications . Related work at Penn State has been ex - ploring the impacts of up - front design planning in end - user programming , using simple representations like concept maps [ 23 ] .
