INTRODUCTION Nucleated condensates formed by macromolecular assemblies or liquid - liquid phase separation are recognized as a fundamental mechanism to explain the biophysical basis of chromatin organiza - tion and gene regulation ( 1 – 4 ) . The formation of biomolecular con - densates is largely driven by multivalent interactions among low - complexity domains ( LCDs ) or intrinsically disordered regions ( IDRs ) ( 5 – 8 ) , although the molecular principles governing the pro - pensity of biomolecules to phase separate remain incompletely un - derstood . IDR - mediated phase separation has been postulated as a mechanism by which transcription factors ( TFs ) and coactivators induce gene activation ( 9 – 13 ) ; however , there remains no direct ev - idence nor mechanistic details of whether and how nuclear conden - sates regulate endogenous gene transcription , largely because of a lack of experimental tools for the targeted formation and purifica - tion of nucleated condensates at native chromatin . Advances in optogenetic platforms that use light to activate IDR - mediated macromolecular assemblies have provided crucial insights into the biophysical properties of inducible condensation , but exist - ing tools rely primarily on the random nucleation of intracellular condensates with limited information about effects on gene tran - scription or chromatin regulation ( 14 – 16 ) . By combining optoge - netics with catalytically dead CRISPR - Cas9 ( dCas9 ) or tetO operators , a few improved strategies were developed to examine the effects of condensate formation on chromatin function or gene expression ( 17 , 18 ) ; however , these methods preclude simulta - neous analyses of chromatin configuration and interactions caused by localized condensation . Moreover , the molecular composition of nuclear condensates , which may provide critical insight into their formation and function in living cells , has not been evaluated . To address this critical technical gap , we describe here a new ap - proach , termed light - activated macromolecular phase separation or LAMPS , coupling optogenetics with dCas9 - mediated chromatin capture to dissect the molecular composition and functional conse - quences of inducible condensation at native chromatin in living cells . We establish evidence that LAMPS - induced condensation at endogenous enhancers and promoters activates transcription by re - configuring chromatin accessibility , DNA looping , and multipro - tein assemblies . Affinity purification and comparative proteomic profiling of LAMPS - induced condensates yield mechanistic insights into condensation - dependent compartmentalization of higher - order assemblies for gene activation . Our findings support a model in which nuclear condensation regulates gene transcription by selectively reconstituting local macromolecular composition and assembly to reconfigure chromatin structure and function . 1 Children ’ s Medical Center Research Institute , University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center , Dallas , TX 75390 , USA . 2 Department of Pediatrics , Harold C .

Adv . 9 , eadg1123 ( 2023 ) 31 March 2023 1 of 17 S C I E N C E A D VA N C E S | R E S E A R C H A R T I C L E RESULTS Design of LAMPS Optogenetic approaches have recently been leveraged to dissect the biophysical properties of biomolecular condensates by fusing the photolyase homology region ( PHR ) domain of the Arabidopsis thaliana cryptochrome 2 ( CRY2 ) ( 19 ) to various IDR domains , en - abling inducible and reversible condensation in living cells ( 14 – 18 ) . When fused to dCas9 , light - induced condensates targeted to telo - meres preferentially formed across low - density genomic regions , mechanically extruding chromatin into spatially segregated territo - ries akin to chromosomal compartments ( 17 ) . The nonuniform condensation of genomic regions suggests that biomolecular con - densation could generate the biophysical force to shape chromatin architecture such as enhancer - promoter looping for gene activa - tion ; however , this hypothesis has not been substantiated by the direct measurement of condensation - mediated effects on gene tran - scription and chromatin configuration ( 17 , 20 ) . Thus , there remains an unmet need for experimental means to simultaneously induce targeted condensation , assess functional consequences of conden - sate formation , and dissect their biomolecular composition at native chromatin . In designing LAMPS , we sought to leverage light - induced con - densate formation , dCas9 and single guide RNA ( sgRNA ) – mediat - ed targeting to a single endogenous genomic locus , and affinity purification to characterize nuclear condensates in situ ( Fig . 1A ) . We first devised a multicistronic construct containing an N - termi - nal IDR , an mCherry fluorescent reporter , a CRY2 - PHR fusion protein , a dCas9 flanked by nuclear localization signals ( NLS ) , and a C - terminal biotin acceptor ( BioTAP ) recognized by endoge - nous biotin ligases ( Fig . 1B ) ( 21 , 22 ) . Upon coexpression of se - quence - specific sgRNAs and in vivo biotinylation of dCas9 - CRY2 - mCherry - IDR fusion proteins in living cells , the genomic locus – associated macromolecules are induced to form condensates by blue light illumination and subsequently isolated by biotin - strep - tavidin – based high - affinity purification . The purified protein - DNA complexes are identified and characterized by proteomics and chro - matin conformation capture ( 3C ) ( 23 ) for study of condensation - associated proteins and DNA looping , respectively ( Fig . 1A ) ( 21 , 22 , 24 ) . Hence , LAMPS offers the unique capacity for spatiotempo - ral control of nuclear condensation with parallel analysis of gene transcription and chromatin regulation , enabling the dissection of the molecular links between nuclear condensation and transcrip - tional function at endogenous genomic loci . Activation of endogenous gene transcription by LAMPS - induced condensation The efficiency of light - activated macromolecule clustering is a crit - ical factor in the design of inducible condensation . We first opti - mized the blue light – responsive CRY2 module in the LAMPS design . Several CRY2 variants have been described with differing light - activated oligomerization propensities , including a Glu - to - Gly substitution at position 490 of CRY2 ( CRY2 E490G ) ( 25 ) , a E490R substitution ( CRY2 E490R ) ( 26 ) , and a variant modified with a C - terminal 9 - mer peptide ( CRY2 Clust ) ( Fig . 1B ) ( 27 ) . We tested constructs containing wild - type ( WT ) or variant CRY2 fused to mCherry and dCas9 ( fig . S1A ) and observed their oligomerization properties . Upon transient expression in HeLa cells followed by flow cytometry sorting of cells based on comparable expression of both mCherry and zsGreen from dCas9 - CRY2 and sgRNA constructs , respectively ( fig . S1 , B to D ) , all dCas9 - CRY2 constructs exhibited dim and diffuse signals distributed within the nucleoplasm under the nonilluminated ( dark ) condition . After light illumination for 5 min at 488 nm , mCherry puncta were readily detected ( Fig . 1C ) . Similar puncta formation was observed in cells with or without nontargeting ( sgGal4 ) or sequence - specific sgRNAs ( sgHS2 ) , indicating that sgRNA expression has no effect on dCas9 - CRY2 – mediated condensation . Moreover , dCas9 - CRY2 Clust consistently produced the largest and brightest puncta , indicating the most robust oligomerization upon light activation ( Fig . 1C ) . We next determined whether LAMPS - mediated condensate for - mation at dCas9 - targeted genomic loci would affect endogenous gene transcription . In proof - of - principle studies , we chose to target the HS2 enhancer of the β - globin locus control region ( LCR ) and the BCL11A promoter as two testbed cis - regulatory ele - ments ( CREs ) ( Fig . 1B ) . The HS2 enhancer is required for the tran - scriptional activation of β - like globin genes ( e . g . , HBB ) ( 21 ) , whereas BCL11A is a TF that controls developmental hemoglobin switching ( 28 ) . We reasoned these well - characterized CREs , and the low basal expression of their target genes in HeLa cells would provide ideal testbeds to study gene activation . Last , we considered the incorporation of self - associating IDRs into LAMPS , as these domains are the major determinants of biomolecular condensation through multivalent interactions ( 1 , 20 ) . Two prototypical domains , the N - terminal IDR of the FET ( FUS , EWS , and TAF15 ) family protein FUS ( FUS N ) and the C - terminal IDRs of the bromodomain protein BRD4 ( BRD4 ∆ N ) , are well - established to undergo conden - sation ( 4 , 7 ) . We therefore examined the effect of incorporating IDRs into LAMPS - induced condensates on target gene expression . We engineered constructs with or without FUS N or BRD4 ∆ N and measured gene expression before and after light - induced clus - tering in cells coexpressing dCas9 - CRY2 with or without HS2 en - hancer – or BCL11A promoter – targeting sgRNAs ( sgHS2 and sgBCL11A ) , respectively ( fig . S1 , A and B ) . While light - induced clustering of dCas9 - CRY2 variants without IDRs had variable or no effects on HBB and BCL11A expression , incorporation of IDRs to dCas9 - CRY2 Clust consistently produced the most notable gene activation despite comparable expression levels of all dCas9 - CRY2 variants ( Fig . 1D and fig . S1 , C and D ) . LAMPS - induced gene acti - vation was dependent on the coexpression of enhancer - or promot - er - targeting sgRNAs , illustrating an dCas9 / sgRNA - mediated on - target effect . Moreover , the IDR - fused dCas9 - CRY2 Clust consistent - ly displayed larger sizes , higher intensities , and faster kinetics of puncta formation relative to other variants following a single pulse of blue light illumination ( fig . S2 , A to C ) . These results dem - onstrate that light - induced clustering of IDR - containing protein complexes activates endogenous gene transcription at native chro - matin . Moreover , CRY2 Clust outperforms other variants tested for optogenetic control of nuclear condensation and was selected for the finalized LAMPS design in subsequent studies . Biophysical properties of LAMPS - activated nuclear condensates Having established the role of the IDR - containing dCas9 - CRY2 Clust in gene activation , we next assessed the kinetics and biophysical properties of LAMPS - induced condensation by stably expressing IDR - fused dCas9 - CRY2 Clust with the CRE - targeting sgRNAs in HeLa cells .

By sampling cells at various time points after a single 5 - min pulse of illumination , we noted that HBB or BCL11A mRNA and primary transcripts were progressively and significantly increased over time and peaked at 30 to 45 min after illumination ( fig . S3 , A and B ) . Furthermore , we confirmed that LAMPS condensation could ac - tivate target gene expression at other loci including the MYOD pro - moter and IL1RN enhancer upon blue light illumination ( fig . S3C ) , indicating that LAMPS - mediated gene activation is generalizable to multiple genomic loci . To assess the underlying biophysical properties of LAMPS - induced condensation , we performed a series of imaging studies . We noted progressively increased intensities of LAMPS - induced Fig . 1 .

We next sought evidence to validate whether LAMPS - activated conden - sates have material properties consistent with membraneless struc - tures in living cells . First , we observed fusion events between distinct puncta upon LAMPS - induced condensation , resulting in their pro - gressive aggregation into larger structures ( Fig . 2C ) , consistent with liquid - like behavior . Second , we performed fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) experiments to determine whether LAMPS - induced puncta are dynamic structures that continually ex - change constituent molecules with surrounding partners at steady state , a known property of biomolecular condensates ( 1 – 4 ) . Puncta formed by dCas9 - CRY2 Clust - FUS N and dCas9 - CRY2 Clust - BRD4 ∆ N quickly recovered after localized photobleaching with a half - life of recovery at 7 . 5 ± 1 . 1 s and 5 . 5 ± 3 . 2 s , respectively ( Fig . 2D ) .

Togeth - er , these results strongly suggest that LAMPS - activated macromol - ecule clustering exhibits material properties consistent with biomolecular condensates in living cells . Molecular determinants of LAMPS - mediated nuclear condensation in living cells Our tool - building experiments revealed that only the combination of the CRY2 Clust variant and IDRs induced puncta formation with notable gene activation ( Figs . 1D and 2 , A to E ) , suggesting that IDRs are indispensable for LAMPS - mediated effects on transcrip - tion . These findings raised an important question about the molec - ular determinants of LAMPS - mediated nuclear condensation in living cells . We reasoned that CRY2 Clust oligomerization confers LAMPS with sufficient nucleating energy to seed condensates but alone lacks the biophysical and / or biochemical property conferred by IDRs , which is needed to selectively compartmentalize molecules into condensates for gene activation . Consequently , CRY2 Clust in this model can potentiate the nucleation of IDR - mediated conden - sates more than the other CRY2 variants to induce IDR - dependent gene activation . To test this hypothesis , we leveraged two recently established mutants , one impairing CRY2 Clust homo - oligomerization by a Leu - 7 - Lys ( L7K ) CRY2 Clust mutation ( 27 ) and the other abrogating FUS N - IDR condensation by 15 Tyr - to - Ser substitutions ( 29 ) . We first tested the CRY2 Clust L7K mutant ( hereafter Clust mut ; Fig . 3A ) that alters the hydrophobicity of the C - terminal Clust 9 - mer peptide ( ARDPPDLDN ) required for its enhanced homo - clustering com - pared to WT CRY2 ( 27 ) . We observed that FUS N - fused LAMPS condensates harboring Clust mut had reduced kinetics of puncta for - mation compared to those with native Clust upon blue light illumi - nation ( Fig . 3B ) . Clust mut - induced puncta were also less dynamic , exhibiting slower recovery kinetics after localized photobleaching with a half - life of recovery 10 . 7 ± 2 . 7 s compared to 4 . 6 ± 0 . 9 s for native Clust ( Fig . 3C ) . These findings suggest that the CRY2 moiety primarily seeds condensate formation , as impairing Clust - driven clustering propensity by point mutation while retaining FUS N may still endow nascent Clust mut condensates with an IDR - dependent composition that promotes gene activation , although with reduced efficiency due to impaired CRY2 seeding . To test the role of IDRs in condensation dynamics , we incorporated the FUS N IDR mutant , which contains 15 Tyr - to - Ser substitutions in a critical tract of FUS N IDR known to impair condensation ( hereaf - ter FUS Nmut ; Fig . 3A ) ( 29 ) . As expected , FUS Nmut fused to CRY2 Clust both impaired light - induced condensate formation and reduced its recovery rate after photobleaching to a greater degree than Clust mut , whereas double mutation of Clust and FUS N ( hereafter FUS Nmut - Clust mut ) impaired light - activated condensation to levels compara - ble to native Clust without IDRs ( Figs . 2E and 3 , B and C ) . The dom - inant effect of FUS N mutation on condensate dynamics suggests that IDRs may confer permeability to condensates such that constit - uent molecules are dynamically incorporated . To test whether and how the modulation of LAMPS condensa - tion by altering clustering efficiency or IDR sequence affects target gene transcription , we measured gene expression in HeLa cells co - expressing WT or mutant LAMPS with HS2 enhancer - targeting sgRNAs by transient transfection and in stable cell lines . Notably , Clust mut alone reduced the target gene ( HBB ) expression to 68 . 9 and 65 . 8 % of the levels induced by native CRY2 Clust in both tran - sient and stable expression cells ( Fig . 3 , D and E ) . FUS Nmut alone reduced HBB expression to 26 . 9 and 21 . 1 % of the levels induced by WT FUS N , whereas the FUS Nmut - Clust mut double mutant abol - ished gene activation ( Fig . 3 , D and E ) , suggesting a dominant role of IDRs in LAMPS - mediated gene activation . Together , these find - ings not only provide insight into distinct functions of LAMPS components ( CRY2 Clust versus IDR ) in controlling condensation - mediated gene activation but also showcase how the modularity of LAMPS components could be broadly leveraged to fine - tune gene activity and dissect the biophysical basis of condensation - de - pendent gene regulation using programmable condensates . Targeting of LAMPS - induced condensation to native genomic loci Transcription - dependent biomolecular condensation emerges as a key feature of gene regulation ( 9 – 12 , 30 , 31 ) , yet the precise mech - anisms by which these condensates modulate gene transcription at native chromatin remain elusive . A unique feature of LAMPS is the ability to capture de novo – formed condensates in situ for biochem - ical and mechanistic studies ( Fig . 1A ) . This is achieved by strepta - vidin - based affinity purification of biotinylated dCas9 - tethered protein - DNA complexes at endogenous genomic loci ( 21 , 22 ) . To validate the LAMPS approach for identifying the macromo - lecular composition of locus - specific nuclear condensates in living cells , we first sought evidence for on - target association of LAMPS complexes at the sgRNA - targeted HS2 enhancer . Upon stable ex - pression of dCas9 - CRY2 Clust - FUS N or dCas9 - CRY2 Clust - BRD4 ∆ N with or without sgHS2 in HeLa cells , the dCas9 - tethered chromatin was cross - linked , fragmented , and affinity - purified using streptavi - din magnetic beads , followed by analysis of the captured DNA using the LAMPS – chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) assay ( Fig . 4A ) ( 21 , 22 , 24 ) . We observed significant dCas9 enrichment at the HS2 locus ( 852 - to 1687 - fold relative to nontargeting sgRNA control ; Fig . 4B ) , indicating efficient recruitment of LAMPS complexes to native chromatin . Moreover , on - target dCas9 signal further increased upon light induction likely because of LAMPS - mediated clustering . To evaluate specificity , we per - formed deep sequencing of dCas9 - bound genomic DNA . Notably , the recruitment of dCas9 by sgHS2 resulted in enrichment of HS2 with few nonspecific dCas9 binding regions , including pre - dicted off - targets , at genome scale ( Fig . 4C and fig . S4 , A and B ) . These chromatin assays provide evidence that LAMPS complexes are highly enriched at the dCas9 / sgRNA - targeted genomic loci . Altered chromatin accessibility and DNA looping by LAMPS - activated condensation We next sought to address how LAMPS - induced condensation mechanistically activates gene transcription . We hypothesized that de novo condensation creates a local chromatin environment per - missive for recruitment of TFs and coactivators through IDR - medi - ated multivalent interactions . To test this , we performed assay for transposase - accessible chromatin using sequencing ( ATAC - seq ) to assess chromatin accessibility at LAMPS - targeted HS2 before and after blue light illumination . Despite strong enrichment of sgRNA - mediated dCas9 binding at HS2 ( Fig . 4 , B and C ) , no detect - able ATAC - seq signal was observed before illumination ( fig . S5A ) , Kim et al . , Sci .

By contrast , light - activated condensation increased chromatin ac - cessibility at HS2 for both dCas9 - CRY2 Clust - FUS N and dCas9 - CRY2 Clust - BRD4 ∆ N ( Fig . 4 , D and E , and fig . S5A ) . Notably , cells expressing the mutant FUS Nmut also displayed increased chromatin accessibility upon blue light illumination ( Fig . 4E ) , suggesting that LAMPS clustering is sufficient to modulate chromatin accessibility at the target loci but the IDR - mediated composition of condensates is required for subsequent gene activation . These results support the model by which LAMPS - induced nuclear condensation increases chromatin accessibility to facilitate the recruitment of TFs , enabling the assembly of transcriptional complexes for gene activation . Chromatin organization maintained by long - range DNA inter - actions such as enhancer - promoter looping is critical for transcrip - tional regulation ( 32 ) . Given the unique feature of LAMPS for unbiased analysis of locus - regulating chromatin interactions ( 21 , 22 ) , we examined HS2 - associated chromatin looping before and after light - activated condensation . Upon coexpression of dCas9 - CRY2 Clust - FUS N or dCas9 - CRY2 Clust - BRD4 ∆ N with sgHS2 , long - range DNA contacts associated with dCas9 - targeted HS2 were cross - linked , followed by Dpn II digestion and proximity ligation of interacting DNA fragments . Locus - specific interactions were captured by streptavidin - based purification of biotinylated dCas9 and analyzed by paired - end sequencing using the LAMPS – 3C se - quencing ( 3C - seq ) assay ( Fig . 4D ) . Using this approach , we first noted sparse and spurious interac - tions at HS2 before illumination , consistent with low basal enhancer activity in HeLa cells ( Fig . 4E and fig . S5B ) . By contrast , we detected increased numbers and distances of long - range DNA interactions for both dCas9 - CRY2 Clust - FUS N and dCas9 - CRY2 Clust - BRD4 ∆ N after blue light illumination . The identification of DNA loops between the HS2 enhancer , HBB and HBD promoters , and HBBP1 intergenic regions is consistent with their roles in β - globin transcription ( 21 , 33 , 34 ) . We observed significant up - regu - lation of the HBB , HBD , and HBBP1 genes , which were associated with more consistent enhancer - promoter loop formation , but var - iable or no change in the expression of the more distal and silent olfactory genes ( Fig . 4F ) . We performed parallel experiments with FUS Nmut LAMPS and observed reduced long - range chromatin in - teractions , including known enhancer - promoter loops ( Fig . 4E and fig . S5B ) , consistent with a critical role for IDRs in LAMPS - medi - ated condensation and gene activation ( Fig . 3 ) . Together , these results demonstrate that LAMPS - mediated condensation induces de novo formation of chromatin loops , providing direct evidence for the emergent model that the condensation of macromolecules may represent the biophysical force to structure the three - dimen - sional ( 3D ) genome ( 17 ) . Notably , LAMPS - activated HeLa cells contained fewer long - range interactions compared to HS2 - associated interactions in em - bryonic / fetal - stage human umbilical cord blood - derived erythroid progenitor cells ( HUDEP1 ) or adult - stage ( HUDEP2 ) erythroblasts that endogenously express β - globin genes ( Fig . 4E ) ( 35 , 36 ) . Hence , while LAMPS - mediated condensation is sufficient to initiate chro - matin looping for gene activation , the stabilization and / or propaga - tion of these loops likely require additional mechanisms such as the action of lineage - specific TFs , the recruitment of specific chromatin regulators , and / or the epigenetic state of local chromatin . Reconfiguration of proteomic composition for gene activation by LAMPS - activated condensation Biomolecular condensation is recognized as a fundamental mecha - nism underlying diverse intracellular structures , yet little is known of their regulatory composition under physiological conditions where their functional consequences have been established . Having demonstrated the biophysical properties of LAMPS - activat - ed nuclear condensates and the determinants for their effects on gene transcription and chromatin configuration , we next sought to elucidate the molecular composition and dynamics of light - induced condensates in living cells . To this end , we leveraged the biotinylated dCas9 moiety and per - formed proteomic analysis of purified LAMPS - induced conden - sates ( Fig . 1A ) . Specifically , HeLa cells stably expressing dCas9 - CRY2 Clust - FUS N ( or with FUS Nmut ) and sgHS2 were illuminated with blue light and immediately cross - linked to stabilize conden - sate - chromatin interactions , while nonilluminated cells were pro - cessed in parallel as a negative control . Stringent urea washes were performed to remove cytoplasmic and nuclear soluble frac - tions and to enrich chromatin - bound complexes ; this step is also intended to deplete nonchromatin bound condensates nucleated by CRY2 clustering to further enrich for on - target condensates ( 21 ) . Condensate - associated proteins cross - linked to chromatin were then isolated and copurified with dCas9 using streptavidin - conjugated magnetic beads , followed by on - bead trypsin digestion and mass spectrometry - based proteomic profiling ( Fig . 5A ) . We identified 258 and 184 significantly enriched or depleted nuclear proteins , respectively , in light - activated condensates relative to nonilluminated controls ( log 2 fold change ≥ 1 or ≤ − 1 , P < 0 . 01 from three replicate experiments ; table S1 ) . Notably , RNA polymer - ase II ( Pol II ) subunits ( POLR2B , POLR2G , and POLR2I ) , general TFs ( TAF1 , TAF2 , and GTF2F1 ) , transcriptional coactivators ( EP300 , PAF1 , and CCNT1 ) , mediators ( MED1 , MED23 , and MED24 ) , and cohesin complexes ( RAD21 , SMC1A , SMC1B , and SMC3 ) were among the top enriched proteins . By contrast , epige - netic corepressors including human silencing hub ( HUSH ) sub - units PPHLN1 , FAM208A , and MPHOSPH8 ( 37 , 38 ) , RNA splicing factors , and nuclear lamins ( LMNA and LMNB1 ) were the top depleted proteins in LAMPS - induced condensates ( Fig . 5B ) . To identify candidate cellular pathways relevant to LAMPS - induced condensation , we performed gene ontology and pathway analyses of the enriched or depleted proteins . Chromatin organization , regulation of gene transcription , and nucleic acid binding were among the top enriched biological processes or mo - lecular functions , whereas RNA splicing , DNA packaging , and nuclear organization were associated with the depleted proteins ( Fig . 5C and table S2 ) . The enrichment and depletion of distinct protein complexes supports the notion that nuclear condensation provides a mechanism to selectively partition proteins into com - partmentalized , higher - order assemblies to regulate gene transcrip - tion ( 39 ) . To validate candidate condensate - associated proteins identified from proteomics , we examined the chromatin occupancy of RNA Pol II ( RPB1 ) and cohesin subunits ( RAD21 and SMC1 ) . We detected enrichment of Pol II and cohesin after light illumina - tion at HS2 but not at nontargeted genomic loci ( fig . S6A ) , consis - tent with their recruitment to LAMPS - targeted condensates . By parallel analysis of the proteomic composition of LAMPS - ac - tivated condensates with the mutant ( FUS Nmut ) IDR , we observed a nearly complete loss of enriched coactivators and chromatin Kim et al . , Sci .

S6B ) . IDR mutation also abrogated the selective depletion of nuclear lamina proteins and corepressors as - sociated with the native IDR . These results , together with the anal - yses of condensate properties ( Fig . 3 , A to C ) , gene transcription ( Fig . 3 , D and E ) , and long - range chromatin looping ( Fig . 4E ) , provide strong support for a dominant role of IDRs in mediating the selective compartmentalization of nuclear factors into LAMPS - seeded condensates for gene activation . Together , by profiling the proteome composition and 3D con - formation of light - activated nuclear condensates in living cells , we provide evidence that inducible condensate formation at an Fig . 5 .

Therefore , by engineering LAMPS - activated condensation in living cells , our findings support a model whereby targeted formation of macromolecular condensates induces reconfiguration of chromatin architecture and accessibility to modulate gene transcription . DISCUSSION Conventional models of gene activation posit that cooperative binding of TFs to gene - proximal promoters and / or gene - distal en - hancers mediates long - range DNA looping through protein - protein interactions , triggering the recruitment of additional coactivators to assemble the transcriptional complexes ( 40 ) . A revised conceptual model was recently proposed invoking condensation of LCD - con - taining TFs as the biophysical basis by which long - range DNA con - tacts are nucleated between distal CREs and gene - proximal promoters , establishing so - called “ transcriptional hubs ” ( 9 , 12 , 41 ) , although direct evidence is still lacking . Several recent studies demonstrated that condensation of TFs can activate transcription by measuring reporter gene expression or global nascent tran - scripts . Specifically , engineered TetR - containing TF droplets medi - ated by FUS N was shown to aggregate at the promoter of a reporter gene to activate its expression in mammalian cell lines ( 18 ) . In ad - dition , TAF15 , another FET family TF , is recruited by RNA Pol II to amplify global gene expression through heterotypic condensation with the C terminus of RNA Pol II ( 42 ) . However , other studies have also argued that gene activation by TFs occurs independently of condensation . For example , using inducible TF droplet systems targetable to knock - in LacO reporter loci , it was found that reporter gene activation occurs primarily via multivalent protein recruit - ment and TF supersaturation is inhibitory for gene activation ( 43 ) . Another study showed that the overexpressed LCD of Ewing sarcoma ( EWS ) TF is incorporated into endogenous EWS - FLI1 puncta in EWS cells but condensate formation repressed EWS target gene transcription ( 44 ) . Although these approaches provide crucial insights into the relationship between TF condensation and gene transcription , they do not allow for simultaneous analyses of changes in gene activity , chromatin structure , and interactions caused by induced condensation at endogenous loci . The macromo - lecular composition of nuclear condensates and the mechanisms underlying their formation and function in native chromatin remain largely unexplored . In this study , we introduce a bipartite method for light - activated formation of nuclear condensates at native chromatin and biochem - ical interrogation of their molecular consequences . This system le - verages two unique features , CRY2 - based optogenetics ( 45 ) and biotinylated dCas9 - mediated chromatin capture ( 21 ) , to dissect the roles of condensate formation in gene regulation . Using the human β - globin HS2 enhancer as a testbed genomic locus , we estab - lish evidence that light - activated nuclear condensates can induce se - lective TF recruitment and chromatin accessibility at targeted genomic loci . LAMPS - mediated condensation induces de novo for - mation of long - range chromatin interactions including enhancer - promoter loops to activate endogenous gene transcription . These results are consistent with recent findings that oncogenic transloca - tions involving fusion of IDR domains to chromatin - binding TFs drive condensation and aberrant chromatin loop formation in cancer cells ( 46 ) . Biomolecular condensation is recognized as a fundamental mechanism for the compartmentalization of intracellular biochem - ical processes ( 3 , 20 ) . In the nucleus , the formation of nanoscale transcriptional condensates has been described to control several steps of gene activation including the formation of preinitiation complexes , transcriptional pausing and elongation , super - enhancer clustering , and mRNA splicing and processing ( 9 – 12 , 30 , 41 ) . Despite these findings , little is known about whether and how dis - tinct molecular compositions of condensates contribute to biologi - cal processes under physiological contexts . Here , we attempted to address this question using dCas9 - mediated genome targeting and biotin - streptavidin – based affinity capture to characterize the regulatory composition of light - induced condensates in living cells . We identified an ensemble of nuclear proteins specifically en - riched in LAMPS - induced condensates , including factors associat - ed with basal transcriptional machinery , general TFs , coactivators , and chromatin structure proteins . The identification of chromatin looping factors ( e . g . , every subunit of the cohesin complex ) and transcriptional apparatus ( e . g . , RNA Pol II subunits ) is consistent with our findings of increased chromatin accessibility and de novo formation of long - range chromatin loops . Moreover , we iden - tified nuclear factors depleted in LAMPS - induced condensates . These include epigenetic repressors associated with heterochroma - tin formation , such as known subunits of the HUSH complex asso - ciated with retrotransposon silencing ( 37 , 38 ) and nuclear lamina Fig . 6 . Nuclear condensation modulates gene transcription by chromatin reconfiguration . Schematic of the model for LAMPS - mediated nuclear condensation in transcriptional regulation . Kim et al . , Sci . Adv . 9 , eadg1123 ( 2023 ) 31 March 2023 10 of 17 S C I E N C E A D VA N C E S | R E S E A R C H A R T I C L E and organization proteins . Crucially , the differential enrichment and depletion of distinct factors in LAMPS - induced condensates is dependent on IDR - mediated multivalent interactions , as IDR mutation abrogates these profiles , consistent with the notion that condensate formation provides a mechanism to selectively com - partmentalize protein complexes into higher - order assemblies for gene regulation . In considering LAMPS for studying the structure and function of nuclear condensation , the following caveats are warranted . First , while our chromatin assays provide strong support for LAMPS on - target association and biological impact , one limitation of this work is the absence of direct microscopic evidence for condensate coloc - alization with the target loci . Experiments such as immunofluores - cence coupled with DNA fluorescence in situ hybridization may resolve this outstanding issue , although such an approach has proved technically challenging . Second , although our findings val - idate the requirement of IDR - dependent condensation in LAMPS - mediated remodeling of condensate composition for gene activa - tion , it remains possible that IDR mutation also impairs key resi - dues supporting protein - protein interaction with transcriptional cofactors ( 47 , 48 ) . It will be important in future studies to deconvo - lute which residues in IDRs support condensate formation versus direct protein interaction . We envision that the modularity of the LAMPS system can facilitate the systematic residue - by - residue in - terrogation of the relative contribution of condensation versus protein - protein interaction by TF activation domains on endoge - nous gene transcription . Third , while LAMPS - proteomics enables the unbiased identification of candidate regulators specifically en - riched or depleted in LAMPS - induced condensates , some of the identified factors might not directly associate with the targeted genomic loci because of condensation of indirect interactions and / or nonchromatin - associated dCas9 that are residually en - riched . Hence , the roles of candidate “ client ” proteins in LAMPS - mediated gene activation warrant further investigation . By contrast , the LAMPS - ChIP and LAMPS – 3C - seq assays , which are based on analyzed dCas9 - bound DNA elements , are capable of quantifying LAMPS - induced effects at the dCas9 - targeted genomic loci . Last , while we showcased the applications of LAMPS by focusing on two exemplary IDRs , the macromolecular composition and func - tional effects on gene transcription by other IDRs also require further investigation . Comparing similarities and / or differences in nuclear condensates formed through various IDR modules in living cells will be necessary to nominate a comprehensive set of candidate factors that regulate condensation - mediated gene transcription . By developing a new approach that enables parallel analyses of changes in gene transcription , chromatin configuration , and mac - romolecular composition caused by light - activated nuclear conden - sation , we conclude that inducible condensation at gene - distal enhancers can increase chromatin accessibility to facilitate the re - cruitment of TFs , coactivators , and chromatin architecture proteins , resulting in the formation of long - range chromatin interactions between enhancers and gene - proximal promoters to activate gene transcription ( Fig . 6 ) . Consistent with this model , recent studies using quantitative imaging of transcriptional bursting suggest that enhancer activation correlates with the temporal frequency of en - hancer - promoter interactions and TF occupancy ( 49 ) . Therefore , the cooperative nucleation of proteins and nucleic acids into biomo - lecular condensates at both enhancers and promoters and their sub - sequent interactions across nuclear space could provide the driving force to spatially approximate otherwise distant CREs together . Note that RNA molecules are also recognized as essential compo - nents in condensation and may modulate the viscosity and dynam - ics of phase - separated condensates ( 8 , 31 , 50 , 51 ) . RNA itself can physically interact with RNA binding molecules and splicing factors through multivalent interactions to facilitate condensate for - mation . In this study , we note the depletion of RNA splicing factors in LAMPS - induced condensates , consistent with the notion that condensation may enable selective compartmentalization of protein complexes by IDR - mediated multivalent interactions . Further studies are needed to determine the contribution of differ - ent RNA species and RNA - interacting proteins to LAMPS - mediat - ed condensate formation and gene activation . The biotinylated dCas9 affinity capture in the LAMPS design allows for copurifica - tion of chromatin - associated RNAs that may be incorporated into nuclear condensates for gene regulation ( 21 ) . Given its modular design and programmability , we envision LAMPS to be broadly applicable for dissecting the structure - func - tion relationship of biomolecular condensation across biological contexts , such as by designing sgRNAs for specific loci of interest and / or by fusing alternative IDR domains , including mutants such as the FUS Nmut demonstrated here . The latter may present a versatile paradigm to assess the pathological roles of nuclear phase transition as undercharacterized mechanisms of human disease ( 46 ) . MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell culture HeLa cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collec - tion ( ATCC , catalog no . CCL - 2 ) and validated by short tandem repeat profiling analysis by the vendor and were free of mycoplasma contamination . Cells were cultured in Dulbecco ’ s modified Eagle ’ s medium ( DMEM ) containing 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) and 1 % penicillin / streptomycin . For lentivirus production , human embry - onic kidney ( HEK ) 293T cells were cultured in DMEM with 1× Glu - taMAX and 1× sodium pyruvate at 37°C with 5 % CO 2 . Cloning of LAMPS vectors CRY2 variants CRY2 mutations ( E490G or E490R ) were individually introduced to the mCh - CRY2 - PHR ( residues 1 to 498 ) – STIMct vector ( 52 ) using the QuikChange Lightning Multi Site - Directed Mutagenesis Kit ( Agilent Technologies ) . The C - terminal extension of CRY2 - PHR ( CRY2 Clust ) was generated by a polymerase incomplete primer ex - tension cloning strategy to add the additional 9 - mer peptide “ ARDPPDLDN . ” The CRY2 Clust L7K mutant was generated by po - lymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) mutagenesis with primers encoding the desired point mutation followed by In - Fusion cloning . The dCas9 fragment from the pLVX - EF1α - dCas9 - CBio - IRES - zsGreen1 vector ( CAPTURE2 . 0 - Cbio ; Addgene , # 138418 ) ( 22 ) flanked with Xma I and Bgl II sites was subcloned into the CRY2 variant – containing vectors to replace STIMct between Bsp EI and Bam HI sites . PCR amplifications were performed using a KOD Start DNA polymerase ( EMD Millipore ) . IDR domain fusion The N terminus of FUS ( FUS N ) and the N terminus – less BRD4 ( BRD4 ∆ N ) ( 6 , 17 , 53 ) were cloned to generate IDR - fused dCas9 - CRY2 variants ( fig . S1A ) . Specifically , for FUS N fusion , the cDNA Kim et al . , Sci .

The dCas9 fragment was fused to the C terminus of CRY2 - PHR as de - scribed above . BRD4 ∆ N was cloned from the full - length BRD4 cDNA [ a gift from C . - M . Chang at University of Texas Southwest - ern Medical Center ( UTSW ) ] . The 15 Tyr - to - Ser FUS N IDR mutant template was generated by PCR amplification with NEB Q5 HiFi polymerase from a synthesized gene block ordered from Genewiz . FUS N or BRD4 ∆ N sequences containing 15 – base pair ( bp ) homol - ogy arms were cloned into the Nhe I – linearized LAMPS vectors ( 100 ng ) using an In - Fusion HD cloning kit ( Clontech ) . All primer sequences are listed in table S3 . sgRNA cloning sgRNAs for site - specific targeting of genomic regions were designed to minimize off - target cleavage based on publicly available filtering tools ( http : / / crispor . tefor . net / ) . To minimize potential interference between the chromatin binding of dCas9 and trans - acting factors , sgRNAs were designed to target the proximity of CREs as previously described ( 21 , 22 ) . Two sgRNAs were used per target site . The oli - gonucleotides for sgHS2 or sgBCL11A ( table S3 ) were phosphory - lated and annealed in the following reaction : 10 μM guide sequence oligo , 10 μM reverse complement oligo , T4 ligation buffer ( 1× ) , and 5 U of T4 polynucleotide kinase ( NEB ) with the cycling parameters of 37°C for 30 min followed by 95°C for 5 min and then ramp down to 25°C at 5°C / min . The annealed oligos were cloned into the sgRNA vectors using a Golden Gate Assembly strategy including the following : 100 ng of circular sgRNA vector plasmid , 0 . 2 μM an - nealed oligos , NEBuffer 2 . 1 ( 1× ) , 20 U of Bbs I restriction enzyme ( NEB ) , 0 . 2 mM adenosine triphosphate , bovine serum albumin ( 0 . 1 mg / ml ) , and 750 U of T4 DNA ligase ( NEB ) with the cycling param - eters of 20 cycles at 37°C for 5 min and 20°C for 5 min , followed by 80°C for 20 min . Transient transfection HeLa cells were seeded into six - well or 35 - mm plates at 50 % con - fluent cell density overnight and then transfected with LAMPS vectors with or without sgRNAs ( two independent sgRNAs per target mixed at 1 : 1 ratio ) using Lipofectamine 3000 following the manufacturer ’ s protocol ( Invitrogen , L3000075 ) . Briefly , solution A was prepared with 125 μl of Opti - MEM I reduced serum medium ( Gibco ) and 3 . 75 μl of Lipofectamine 3000 . Solution B was prepared with 125 μl of Opti - MEM , 1 . 5 μg of LAMPS and 1 μg of sgRNA vector DNA ( 2 . 5 μg of DNA total ) , and 5 μl of P3000 enhancer . Solutions A and B were vortexed briefly , pooled , and incubated for 5 to 10 min at room temperature . The mixture was added to the cells dropwise . Cells were harvested for imaging or gene expression analyses 24 to 48 hours posttransfection . Lentiviral transduction and generation of stable cell lines Lentiviruses containing sgRNAs ( mixed at 1 : 1 ratio for two inde - pendent sgRNAs ) or LAMPS constructs were packaged in HEK293T cells using Lipofectamine 3000 with the following mod - ifications : 6 . 5 μg of psPAX2 ( Addgene , # 12260 ) , 3 . 5 μg of VSV - G ( Addgene , # 8454 ) , and 10 μg of pLenti expression vector ( dCas9 or sgRNAs ) were cotransfected using Lipofectamine 3000 into HEK293T cells on a 10 - cm petri dish with DMEM at 37°C with 5 % CO 2 . After incubation for 6 hours , transfected DMEM was changed with 6 ml of prewarmed lentivirus packaging media ( Opti - MEM I reduced serum medium with GlutaMAX , supple - mental with final concentrations of 5 % FBS and 0 . 2 mM sodium pyruvate ) . Lentiviral particles were then harvested from the super - natant at 48 and 72 hours posttransfection , pooled , and centrifuged briefly to clear cell debris . The viral supernatant was precipitated using the PEG - it Virus Precipitation Solution ( Systems Biosciences ) following the manufacturer ’ s instructions . To transduced cells , con - centrated viral suspensions were added dropwise to target cells at ≥ 95 % confluent cell density in growth media containing polybrene ( 10 μg / ml ) , incubated for 24 hours before changing to fresh media , and then recovered for 2 to 3 days at 37°C followed by fluorescence - activated cell sorting ( FACS ) for high dCas9 / mCherry - expressing cells . Sorted cells were expanded to be transduced with sgRNA - ex - pressing lentiviruses . To obtain cells with a high sgRNA expression , the top 5 % of zsGreen - positive cells were FACS - sorted 48 hours posttransfection and selected with puromycin ( 1 μg / μl ) . The se - quences for sgRNAs are listed in table S3 . Gene expression analysis LAMPS - activated formation of nuclear condensates To induce LAMPS - mediated condensates , HeLa stable cells or tran - siently transfected cells were cultured overnight in 35 - mm glass - bottom plates with DMEM . To minimize effects due to variation in transient transfection efficiency of each LAMPS construct , cells with comparable mCherry signal were FACS - sorted 24 hours after transfection . Cells were incubated in 1× phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) buffer during imaging experiments to remove phenol red . Cells were illuminated with blue light ( 488 nm ) using a Nikon SMZ18 stereomicroscope system for 5 min at room temperature im - mediately after addition of 1× PBS . We used a Nikon INTENSI - LIGHT - CHGFI lamp module ( P2 - EFL filter cube GFP - B ) . The blue light intensity was 0 . 35 mW / cm 2 and measured by the Thor - labs optical power meter PM100D . Blue light – exposed cells were in - cubated in DMEM at 37°C for 30 min before harvesting for gene expression analysis . Control cells without light exposure ( dark ) were prepared in parallel but incubated in the dark room and shield - ed from light using aluminum foil – wrapped 15 - cm petri dish for 5 min . Reverse transcription quantitative PCR RNA was isolated using the TRIzol extraction method as previously described ( 54 ) . cDNAwas generated using an iScript DNA synthesis kit ( Bio - Rad ) . Reverse transcription quantitative PCR ( RT - qPCR ) was performed using the iQ SYBR Green Supermix ( Bio - Rad ) and cycled using a CFX 384 Touch Real Time PCR Detection system ( Bio - Rad ) . Primer sequences are listed in table S3 . Fluorescence imaging HeLa cells were plated on glass - bottom dishes ( Cellvis , catalog no . D35 - 20 - 0 - TOP ) and transfected with LAMPS constructs using Lip - ofectamine 3000 . Fluorescence imaging was performed 24 hours posttransfection on a Nikon Ti2 inverted epifluorescence micro - scope with a Yokogawa W1 dual spinning disk scan head equipped with six solid - state lasers ( 405 , 445 , 488 , 514 , and 640 nm ) for imaging and one additional laser for stimulation ( 473 nm ) . Fluores - cence images were captured using a Photometrics Prime BSI and back - side illuminated scientific complementary metal - oxide - semi - conductor ( sCMOS ) camera . For time - lapse imaging , a 60× oil lens was used for high - resolution images and conducted with an Okolab Kim et al . , Sci .

Blue light illumination was performed with the built - in 488 - nm laser source ( 5 % input ) . The fluorescence intensities of light - induced puncta were calculated by the NIS - Elements AR micro - scope imaging software ( Nikon , NIS - element AR version 4 . 0 ) . To quantify the area of puncta , puncta were selected as the region of interest ( ROI ) ; the area of ROIs was then analyzed by the NIS - Ele - ments software . The changes in puncta intensity ( F − F 0 ) were cal - culated by measuring the local intensity changes of puncta , where F is the fluorescence at time t and F 0 is the fluorescence before blue light illumination . Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching FRAP was carried out by bleaching a defined area with 0 . 1 % laser power for 1 ms after 5 min of illumination . The images were taken before and immediately after bleaching , followed by consecutive imaging every 1 s . Fluorescence intensity was measured using the NIS - Elements AR microscope imaging software . To analyze fluo - rescence recovery in Fig . 2D , fluorescence intensity was normalized to the intensity before bleaching ( i . e . , F = F t / F 0 , where F t is the fluo - rescence at time t and F 0 is the fluorescence before bleaching ) . To analyze fluorescence recovery in Figs . 2E and 3C , the normalized fractional recovery was calculated by ( F t − F bleach ) / ( F max − F bleach ) , where F t is the fluorescence at time t , F max is the maximal fluores - cence after photobleaching , and F bleach is the fluorescence at bleaching . LAMPS – ChIP sequencing Streptavidin affinity purification of dCas9 - captured DNA and sequencing A total of 1 × 10 7 LAMPS - expressing HeLa stable cells transduced with sequence - specific sgRNAs or no sgRNA ( control ) were har - vested , cross - linked with 1 % formaldehyde ( Sigma - Aldrich ) for 10 min with gentle rocking , and quenched with final concentration of 0 . 125 M glycine for 5 min at room temperature . Cross - linked cells were washed twice with 1× PBS and then lysed in 1 ml cell lysis buffer [ 25 mM tris - HCl ( pH 7 . 4 ) , 85 mM KCl , and 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 ] freshly supplemented with 1 mM dithiothreitol ( DTT ) and 1 : 100 protease inhibitor cocktail ( APExBIO ) and rotated for 30 min at 4°C . Cell lysates were centrifuged at 2300 g for 5 min at 4°C to isolate the nuclei . Nuclei were suspended in 500 μl of 0 . 5 % SDS lysis buffer [ 0 . 5 % SDS , 10 mM EDTA , and 50 mM tris - HCl ( pH 8 . 0 ) ] and sonicated to shear chromatin fragments to an average size between 200 and 500 bp using a Branson Sonifier 450 ultrasonic processor ( 20 % amplitude , 0 . 5 - s on / 1 . 0 - s off for 30 s in total or 60 pulses ) . Sheared chromatin was centrifuged at 16 , 100 g for 10 min at 4°C . A total of 450 μl of the supernatant was transferred to a new 1 . 5 - ml Lo - Bind Eppendorf tube and supplemented with a final concentration of 300 mM NaCl and then incubated with 20 μl of Streptavidin Dynabeads MyOne T1 ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , # 65602 or Invitrogen , # 656 - 01 ) at 4°C overnight with rotation . Beads were prewashed twice with ChIP dilution buffer [ 0 . 1 % SDS , 1 % Triton X - 100 , 20 mM tris - HCl ( pH 8 . 1 ) , 150 mM NaCl , and 2 mM EDTA ] . After overnight incubation , beads were washed twice with 1 ml of 2 % SDS , twice with 1 ml of radioimmunoprecipitation assay ( RIPA ) buffer containing 0 . 5 M NaCl , twice with 1 ml of LiCl buffer [ 250 mM LiCl , 0 . 5 % NP - 40 , 0 . 5 % sodium deoxycholate , 1 mM EDTA , and 10 mM tris - HCl ( pH 8 . 0 ) ] , and twice with 1 ml of TE buffer [ 10 mM tris - HCl and 1 mM EDTA ( pH 8 . 0 ) ] . Beads were then incubated with 300 μl of SDS elution buffer [ 1 % SDS , 10 mM EDTA , and 50 mM tris - HCl ( pH 8 . 0 ) ] at 65°C overnight with shaking at 1000 rpm to elute bound chromatin and reverse cross - linking . Eluted chromatin was transferred to new tubes and treated with 3 μl of ribonuclease A ( RNase A ) ( 5 mg / ml ) for 30 min , followed by treatment with 3 μl of proteinase K ( 20 mg / ml ; Invitrogen ) at 37°C for 2 hours and purification using QIAquick spin columns ( QIAGEN ) . One to 10 ng of ChIP DNAwas processed for library generation using the NEBNext Ultra II ChIP sequencing ( ChIP - seq ) Library Prep kit ( NEB ) following the manufacturer ’ s protocol . Libraries were pooled and sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500 system . LAMPS – ChIP - seq data analysis ChIP - seq raw reads were trimmed using Cutadapt ( 55 ) with the pa - rameters - q 20 and - m 10 and aligned to the hg38 human genome assembly using Bowtie2 ( 56 ) with parameter - k 1 . Peak calling was performed using MACS ( 57 ) using the “ - - nomodel ” parameter . Peaks that overlapped with the blacklist regions annotated by the ENCODE project ( 58 ) , the repeat masked region ( chr3 : 93 , 469 , 828 to 93 , 471 , 328 and chr16 : 34 , 571 , 939 to 34 , 576 , 439 ; hg38 ) , or the val - idated nontargeting sgRNA enriched regions ( chr16 : 34 , 580 , 740 to 34 , 583 , 740 ; hg38 ) were removed . To compare the ChIP - seq inten - sities in samples prepared from cells expressing the target - specific sgRNAs versus the no sgRNA control , MAnorm ( 59 ) was applied to remove systematic bias between samples and to calculate the nor - malized ChIP - seq read densities of each peak for all samples . The window size was 1500 bp , which matched the average width of the identified ChIP - seq peaks . LAMPS - ChIP - qPCR A total of 0 . 5 × 10 7 to 1 × 10 7 LAMPS - expressing HeLa stable cells transduced with sgHS2 were used . The captured DNA was isolated following the LAMPS – ChIP - seq protocol described above and an - alyzed by qPCR . For 5 % input control samples , 80 μl of SDS elution buffer was added directly to 20 μl of sheared chromatin before IP . The samples were incubated at 65°C overnight to reverse cross - linking . DNA fragments were purified using the QIAGEN QIA - quick PCR Purification Kit and eluted with 50 μl of elution buffer ( EB ) . Primer sequences are listed in table S3 . LAMPS – 3C - seq Library preparation and sequencing A total of 1 × 10 7 to 5 × 10 7 cells were harvested and washed twice with 1× PBS and cross - linked with 1 % formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature with gentle rocking . The cross - linking reaction was quenched by 0 . 125 mM glycine for 5 min at room temperature , followed by two washes with 1× PBS . Cross - linked cells were resus - pended in 1 ml of ice - cold cell lysis buffer [ 25 mM tris - HCl ( pH 7 . 4 ) , 85 mM KCl , and 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 ] freshly supplemented with 1 mM DTT and 1 : 100 protease inhibitor cocktail and rotated for 30 min at 4°C . Cell lysates were centrifuged at 2300 g for 5 min at 4°C to isolate nuclei .

SDS was sequestered by adding 60 μl of 10 % Triton X - 100 ( final concentration of 1 . 67 % ) and 376 μl of double distilled water ( ddH 2 O ) , followed by incubation at 37°C for 30 min . Nuclei were digested using 300 U of Dpn II ( NEB ) with 60 μl of 10X Dpn II buffer with rotation overnight at 37°C . Dpn II was inactivated at 62°C for 20 min and immediately cooled on ice . The digested nuclei were diluted with 2 . 4 ml of 1 . 15× T4 ligation buffer Kim et al . , Sci . Adv . 9 , eadg1123 ( 2023 ) 31 March 2023 13 of 17 S C I E N C E A D VA N C E S | R E S E A R C H A R T I C L E ( 300 μl of 10× NEB T4 ligase buffer and 1 . 8 ml of ddH 2 O , freshly supplemented with 1 : 100 proteinase inhibitor cocktail ) . Chromatin was proximity ligated by adding 15 μl of NEB T4 DNA ligase ( 400 U / μl ) with rotation at 16°C overnight , followed by rotation for 30 min at room temperature the next morning . Nuclei were collected by centrifugation at 2300 g for 5 min at 4°C and resuspended in 500 μl of RIPA 0 buffer [ 0 . 1 % SDS , 1 % Triton X - 100 , 1 mM EDTA , 10 mM tris - HCl ( pH 7 . 4 ) , and 0 . 1 % sodium deoxycholate ( NaDOC ) ] supplemented with 0 . 25 % sarkosyl ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , followed by sonication to shear chromatin to an average size of ~ 500 bp using a Branson Sonifier 450 ultrasonic processor ( 10 % output , 0 . 5 - s on / 1 . 0 - s off for 45 s in ON total or 90 pulses ) . Sheared chromatin was centrifuged at 16 , 100 g for 10 min at 4°C , and the supernatant was transferred to 1 . 5 ml of DNA Lo - Bind Eppendorf tubes , and a final concentration of 300 mM NaCl was added . Twenty microliters of the MyOne Streptavidin Dynabeads MyOne T1 per sample were prewashed with ChIP dilution buffer and added to sheared chroma - tin for binding overnight at 4°C with rotation . After overnight in - cubation , beads were washed twice with 1 ml of 2 % SDS , twice with 1 ml of high - salt wash buffer [ 0 . 1 % NaDOC , 1 % Triton X - 100 , 1 mM EDTA , 50 mM HEPES ( pH 7 . 5 ) , and 500 mM NaCl ] , twice with 1 ml of LiCl wash buffer [ 250 mM LiCl , 0 . 5 % NP - 40 , 0 . 5 % NaDOC , 1 mM EDTA , and 10 mM tris - HCl ( pH 8 . 1 ) ] , and twice with 1 ml of TE buffer . The chromatin was resuspended in SDS elution buffer [ 1 % SDS , 10 mM EDTA , and 50 mM tris - HCl ( pH 8 . 0 ) ] followed by reverse cross - linking and proteinase K digestion at 65°C overnight . Eluted DNA was removed from beads and puri - fied using QIAquick spin columns ( QIAGEN ) . Two to 5 ng of 3C DNA was processed for library generation using the NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep kit ( NEB ) . Libraries were pooled and paired - end sequencing was performed on an Illumina NextSeq 500 system . LAMPS – 3C - seq data analysis Raw reads were processed as previously described ( 21 , 22 ) . Briefly , read pairs of replicate experiments were merged and mapped sepa - rately to human ( hg38 ) genome assembly . Unmapped reads were searched for Dpn II cut sites and in silico digested , and each digest - ed pair was remapped to hg38 . The mapped reads from both pro - cedures were merged , and reads with low mapping quality were removed . Uniquely mapped reads were paired and PCR duplicates were removed . For each sgRNA - targeted region , the preprocessed read pairs were used to define its peak size . For each peak region , read pairs with both ends within the same peak region were consid - ered as self - ligations and removed before downstream analysis . Read pairs with only one end within the peak region were consid - ered as paired - end tags for analyzing long - range chromatin interactions . LAMPS - proteomics Biotinylated dCas9 - mediated affinity purification A total of 5 × 10 7 dCas9 - CRY2 Clust - FUS N ( or FUS Nmut ) expressing HeLa stable cells transduced with sgHS2 was harvested , cross - linked with 1 % formaldehyde for 10 min with gentle rocking , and quenched with 0 . 125 M of glycine for 5 min at room temperature . Cells were washed twice with 1× PBS , lysed with 1 ml of ice - cold cell lysis buffer [ 25 mM tris - HCl , 85 mM KCl , 0 . 1 % and Triton X - 100 ( pH 7 . 4 ) ] freshly supplemented with 1 mM DTT and 1 : 100 protease inhibitor cocktail ( APExBIO ) , and rotated for 1 hour at 4°C . Cell lysates were centrifuged at 2500 g for 5 min at 4°C to isolate nuclei , and a second wash with 1 ml of ice - cold cell lysis buffer was performed . Washed nuclei were gently resuspended in 0 . 4 ml of 4 % SDS nuclear lysis buffer [ 50 mM tris - HCl ( pH 7 . 4 ) , 1 mM EDTA , and 0 . 5 % SDS ] freshly supplemented with 1 mM DTT and 1 : 100 protease inhibitor cocktail and incubated for 10 min at room temperature . Nuclei were further resuspended with 1 . 2 ml of urea buffer [ 8 M urea , 1 mM EDTA ( pH 8 . 0 ) , and 100 mM am - monium bicarbonate ] by pipetting until homogenous ( use low - binding pipette tips to reduce material loss ) . Lysed nuclei were spun at 16 , 000 g for 15 min at a fixed 22°C ( temperature - regulated ultracentrifuge ) . Chromatin pellets were washed once with 1 . 6 ml of 4 % SDS nuclear lysis buffer to wash out urea , spun again , and then washed twice with 1 ml of 10 mM KCl cell lysis buffer to wash out SDS ( same as above but with 10 mM KCl to avoid SDS precipita - tion ) . Washed chromatin were resuspended into 0 . 8 ml of RIPA 0 buffer [ 10 mM tris - HCl ( pH 7 . 4 ) , 1 mM EDTA ( pH 8 . 0 ) , 0 . 1 % SDS , 1 % Triton X - 100 , and 0 . 1 % NaDOC ] and sonicated to shear chro - matin to an average size of 300 to 600 bp using a Branson Sonifier 450 ultrasonic processor ( 10 % amplitude , 0 . 5 - s on / 1 - s off for 30 s in ON total or 60 pulses ) . Sheared chromatin was centrifuged at 16 , 100 g for 10 min at 4°C . The clarified supernatant was transferred to new tubes and 150 mM final NaCl was added . Fifty microliters of the Streptavidin Dynabeads MyOne T1 ( Thermo Fischer Scientific , # 65602 or Invitrogen , # 656 - 01 ) per sample was prewashed three times in 1 ml of RIPA 0 . 3 buffer [ 10 mM tris - HCl ( pH 7 . 4 ) , 1 mM EDTA ( pH 8 . 0 ) , 0 . 1 % SDS , 1 % Triton X - 100 , 0 . 1 % NaDOC , and 300 mM NaCl ] , and beads were added to the soluble chromatin and rotated overnight at 4°C . After overnight incubation , streptavi - din beads were washed 10 times with 1 ml of ice - cold RIPA wash buffer ( containing 0 . 5 M LiCl ) at 4°C , once with 1 ml of ice - cold 1X PBS , and twice with 1 ml of freshly made 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate solution at 4°C . After the ammonium bicarbonate wash , the samples were transferred to new Protein Lo - Bind Eppen - dorf tubes . The beads for proteomics were quickly spun and placed onto a magnetic rack to completely remove residual wash buffer . In - solution digestion and peptide isolation To improve the sensitivity and minimize sample loss associated with in - gel digestion , we performed in - solution on - bead trypsin di - gestion . Briefly , the washed streptavidin beads were resuspended in 10 μl of sequencing grade modified trypsin ( 10 ng / μl ; Promega , catalog no . V5111 ) in 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , and the beads - trypsin mix was incubated at 37°C with shaking at 1000 rpm for 30 min followed by overnight incubation at 37°C without shaking . An additional 10 μl of trypsin ( 10 ng / μl ) was added the next morning and incubated for another 4 hours at 37°C . After a second round of digestion , the beads were isolated and the clear supernatant containing digested peptides were transferred to a new 1 . 5 ml of Protein Lo - Bind Eppendorf tube . One hundred percent of formic acid ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , # A117 - 50 ) was added to the solution to a 5 % final concentration . The peptide sol - ution was submitted to the UT Southwestern Proteomics Core for mass spectrometry analysis . Proteomics data analysis The liquid chromatography – tandem mass spectrometry data were analyzed using Proteome Discoverer 2 . 4 with the “ matched between runs ” parameter and searched against the UniProt human protein database to assign peptides to master proteins . We used the DEP package from Bioconductor ( www . bioconductor . org / packages / release / bioc / vignettes / DEP / inst / doc / DEP . html ) to nor - malize the protein intensities , impute missing values , and calculate Kim et al . , Sci .
