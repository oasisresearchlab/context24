YITZHAKI Department of Information and Library Studies Bar - llan University , Ramat - Gan ( Israe 0 52900 ( Received August 14 , 1996 ) Titles constitute the most concise statement of a document ' s content , and are heavily used by information retrieval systems . Consequently , the great importance of titles being highly informative is indisputable . The most common measure of title ' informativity ' has been the number of ' substantive " words it includes . Previous studies found significant differences between journals of different subject fields , in the sciences and the social sciences , regarding the number of substantive words in article titles . However , unlike the sciences and the social sciences , very little research has been done on humanities journals . Examining title informativity in a group of eighteen leading English - language journals , covering various humanities disciplines , from 1940 to 1990 , the present study searched for possible differences between the humanities journals and the scientific and social sciences ones , concerning patterns of title informativity . Generally , considerable differences were found in the number of substantive words in article titles between the various humanities journals checked . On the other hand , a comparison of the group - average means and medians of the humanities journals to group figures of journals from the sciences and the social sciences indicates significant differences for almost all decade years studied . However , titles of papers in humanities journals did follow the general trend of increase in informativity , although in a slower pace . Possible explanations of these differences are discussed and areas for further study are suggested . Introduction As is well known , the title is a very important element of any scientific or scholarly paper . Its primary functions are to draw a reader ' s attention to a paper and to indicate its content from a short glimpse , thus contributing to its initial selection or rejection . The title of a research paper is still the fastest and easiest way for identifying its * Paper presented at the Round Table On Editors Of Library Journals ( RTELJ ) at the 61st IFLA General Conference , 20 - 26 August 1995 , Istanbul . 0138 - 9130 / 97 / US $ ! 5 . 00 Copyright(cid:14)9 1997 Akad ~ miai Kiadr , Budapest All rights reserved M . YITZHAKI : INFORMATIVITY OF TITLES OF PAPERS content . Titles constitute the most concise statement of a document content , surrogating it in bibliographies , databases , indexes and reference lists . Information retrieval systems and services make considerable use of titles and the access points they include , in the process of storing , searching and retrieving the information , whether done manually or by computer ( Black t962 ; Bottle 1970 ; Feinberg 1973 ; Buxton 1979 ; Hodges 1983 ; Diodato and Pearson 1985 ) . Moreover , it has long been observed that conventional indexing has many drawbacks as a tool for storing and retrieving information , as compared to the full - text method , which has its own disadvantages . Thus , a free - text search in the " field " of the titles , is frequently a good surrogate , or a necessary supple - ment to a conventional search , based on index - terms or descriptors , especially in cases when conventional searching through index - terms does not yield satisfactory results . Consequently , the great importance of highly informative titles is almost unani - mously accepted in literature and has been heavily emphasized by many writers , such as Luhn ( 1960 ) , Feinberg ( 1973 ) , and others ( Tocatlian 1970 ; Manten and Greenhalgh 1977 ; Buxton 1979 ) , as well as by journal editors and guidance books for scientific and professional authors ( Mitchell 1968 ; O ' Connor and Woodford 1975 ) . Their common assumption was that the more informative titles become , the more effectively they would perform their functions . Literature review A review of the literature reveals two basic approaches to the operational definition of the concept of titles " informativeness " : a subjective approach and an objective one . The subjective approach , which may be called " the whole - title - evaluation approach " , is based on classifying titles into two distinctive categories : informative and non - informative . A title is considered informative if it conveys at least some general idea of the paper ' s content , so that the reader feels he knows what the paper is " about " , without recourse to other sources of information such as the abstract or the paper itself ( Peritz 1984 ) . However , this approach has been little used by researchers , probably due to its subjectivity . The objective approach has two variations . The lesser - used one , ( Montgomery and Swanson 1962 ; O ' Connor 1964 ; Ghosh 1974 ) , is based on visually examining each title in a specific subject bibliography to see if a certain keyword exists in the title . The other variation of the objective approach , most commonly used , is based on a count of substantive words in the title , and sometimes its total number of words too . Substantive 220 Sc ' ientometrics 38 ( 1997 ) M . YITZHAKI : INFORMATIVITY OF TITLES OF PAPERS ( or significant ) words are defined as untrivial words not included in a stoplist of trivial words such as : to , the , of , etc . ( i . e . articles , prepositions , conjunctions , pronouns and auxiliary verbs ) . As reviewed at length elsewhere ( Yitzhaki 1992 ) , the studies by Tocatlian ( 1970 ) , Bird and Knight ( 1975 ) , Balog ( 1980 ) , Buxton and Meadows ( 1977 ) , Diaclato ( 1982 ) , Diener ( 1984 ) , Buxton ( 1987 ) , White ( 1991 ) and Yitzhaki ( 1992 ) found some indications that the number of substantive words in paper titles in various journals increased with time . However , considerable differences were found between the journals studied , almost all of which belonged to the sciences or the social sciences , and the picture revealed concerning the effect of the time factor was not entirely consistent . Findings indicated a general trend , in most studied journals , towards more substantive words in titles of papers . However , the rate of increase differed among the various fields , and occasionally even among journals belonging to the same broad area of knowledge ( i . e . sciences , social sciences , etc . ) . Generally , titles in scientific journals contained more substantive words than those in social sciences journalsl Most studies conducted , using the objective ' substantive - words - count ' measure , employed too small annual samples ( for each point in time ) and , except for Buxton ( 1977 ; 1979 ; 1987 ) , White ( 1991 ) and Yitzhaki ( 1992 ) did not cover long - enough periods necessary to observe possible long - range trends . Consequently , the extent to which most former findings may be relied upon is questionable ; as far as the individual journal or subject area is concerned . Since almost all former studies concentrated mainly on scientific and social sciences journals , rather than on humanities ones , only few humanities journals were studied , and the question remained whether journals belonging to subject fields from the humanities , exhibit similar patterns of title informativity , which differ from those found in scientific and social sciences ones . Purpose of the study The objective of the present study was to assess the long - range trend of the past 50 years , concerning the number of substantive words in article titles in a large group of leading EnglislManguage humanities journals . More specifically , our study aimed to gather empirical answers to the following questions : i . Does a long - term analysis , especially of recent decades , reveal a similar pattern of these journals concerning the length of paper titles ( measured by the number of substantive words they include ) ? Scientometrics 38 ( 1997 ) 221 M . Y1TZHAKI : 1NFORMATIV1TY OF TITLES OF PAPERS 2 . To what extent does this pattern resemble that found for other journals in the social sciences , and the sciences ? Do the findings Co ~ c6ming more substantive words in scientific titles vs . social sciences titles ; apply to thi ~ ~ roup of humanities journals as well ? 3 . Has the number of substantive words in title , of papers reached a ' saturation point ' , as recommended and predicted regardifig scientificjournals ( Balog 1980 ) ? Methodology Eighteen leading English - language journals were selected from various humanities fields such as : philosophy , philology , biblical studies , and English literature , as well as from the fields of history and law . Despite possible arguments to the contrary , we have adopted the conception which Considers the two latter ones among the humanities . Starting with 1930 or 1940 , the appropriate volumes of each tenth calendar year up to 1990 were examined . Usually , the entire annual population of " regular " research papers published in those volumes was checked . In many cases adjacent volumes were also checked r order to enlarge the sample size , so that most samples included about 100 - 150 articles . " Regular research papers " were defined as ordinary full - length original research articles , published in the main part of the journal , excluding review papers as well as all kinds of short publications , such as : " Communications " , " Comments " , " Notes " , etc . As an operational measure of " informativeness " of titles , it was decided to follow the most common aforementioned approach , i . e . to count all " substantive " words appearing in the titles . The count of " substantive " words in the title depends , of course , on compiling a " stoplist " of trivial , " meaningless " or " non - significant " words . Following Tocatlian ( 1970 ) , Feinberg ( 1973 ) , Buxton and Meadows ( 1977 ) and Diodato ( 1982 ) , it was decided in the present study to confine the stoplist to articles , prepositions , conjunctions , pronouns , and auxiliary verbs . The exact procedure and its rules were already described in detail elsewhere ( Yitzhaki 1992 ) . Thus , for each decade year the number of substantive words in the titles in each of the selected journals was counted , detailed frequency distributions were built , and main measures of central tendency ( means and medians ) as well as standard deviations , were calculated , and t - test was used to test the significance of differences between means . 222 Scientometrics 38 ( 1997 ) M ~ YITZHAKt ! INFORMATIVITY OF TITLES OF PAPERS Findings and discussion Table 1 presents the means and medians for the eighteen selected journals , in each decade year during the period under study . It is evident from the table that there are considerable differences between the various journals checked , and a single encompassing pattern which will fit all of them , is difficult to find . Some journals show increases ( not always significant ) concerning our parameter , for almost each decade - year , while others show such increases for only certain decade - years ( individual to each journal ) , and decreases for others .

YITZHAKI : 1NFORMATIVITY OF TITLES OF PAPERS It seems , however , that several conclusions may be drawn from Table 1 : 1 . Despite the individual differences and the lack of one single pattern , there seem to exist certain differences betw ~ n subject fields . In other words , part of the variability seen in the table , concerning title informativity , may be accounted for by the parameter of field affiliation . Taking into consideration the variability within each group of journals belonging to the same field , the weighted means for each group calculated for 1990 for example , indicate that the journals of history and English literature rank first ( with weighted means of 6 . 50 and 6 . 44 respectively ) , followed by the law journals group ( 6 . 19 , or 5 . 97 if the J . of Criminal Law and Criminology is excluded ) . Next come the journals of biblical studies ( 5 . 44 ) , and language and philology ( 5 . 04 , but 5 . 53 if Language Learning is included ) , with the philosophy journals at the bottom , having in 1990 only 3 . 85 substantive words per title on the average . Indeed , history and law journals rank higher than most others , but the same is true with the group of English literature , which is no doubt a pure humanities field . 2 . For most journals there has been a gradual , though not necessarily linear and consistent , increase in the average number of substantive words per title during most of the period under study and apparently , there were also considerable differences in the rate of increase . These increases are even more obvious if intervals of twenty years or longer are compared . The only exception is the group of philosophy journals , most of which display a stagnation in title informativity for most of the studied period . 3 . To be sure , the increase from one decade to the following is not always significant . It is very likely that there were some fluctuations during the various decades checked , so that the long - range trend of increase during the long period checked , was not necessarily linear , even for those journals which show a consistent increase for all decade years checked . However , a tong - range analysis shows a general trend of increase , and the differences between two or three successive decades always accumulate to a significant one . Thus , a cautiously phrased conclusion based on Table 1 suggests a general trend of increase , although not necessarily a clear linear one . However , contrary to most scientific and social sciences journals , the pace of increase in the humanities journals included in the present study , has been much slower , and its long - range trend was not always consistent and linear , revealing some decreases at certain points in time . 4 . Generally , with the exception of philosophy , most of the aforementioned increases occurred only from 1970 , and in some cases a decade earlier . As is well known , the first distinct stage in the development of retrieval systems and services occurred during the 1960 ' s , with the introduction of title indexes and lists of current titles or contents pages as aids to keeping up with literature , in certain fields . The Scientometrics 38 ( 1997 ) 225 M . YITZHAKI : INFORMATIVITY OF TITLES OF PAPERS increases shown for some journals even in the twenty years before 1960 tend to support the explanation suggested by Buxton and Meadows ( 1977 ) , against Tocatlian ( 1970 ) and Bird and Knight ( 1975 ) , claiming a trend towards more informative titles which occurred over a wide range of subject fields in the sciences , and was already apparent before KWIC indexes and computer - assisted searching of title words became common . Although this trend preceded the introduction of these tools , they undoubtedly contributed greatly to the growing awareness of the importance of title informativity . It is evident from the present study that a somewhat similar trend probably occurred among humanities journals too , though in a weaker and slower pace . Our data for 1970 onwards indicate that the aforementioned developments in information retrieval probably had continuous long - range effects throughout the seventies too . Moreover , the continuous increases shown in our table for most journals between 1980 and 1990 may well be attributed to the second stage of developments in information retrieval , namely the vast expansion during the 1980 ' s of on - line searching services in hundreds of databases covering most fields of study .

In Table 2 the group - averaged means and medians of the eighteen humanities journals are compared with group means of journals from the sciences , the social sciences , and the humanities . One can observe that , taken as a group , the average number of substantive words in titles of papers in humanities journals , is significantly lower than that of the social sciences group , not to mention the scientific journals group . In fact , the differences become even greater if the groups of journals from the fields of history and law are excluded . It is worth noting that the journal Language Learning is an eminent exception in its group of language and philology journals , 226 Scientometrics 38 ( 1997 ) M . YITZHAKI : INFORMATIVITY OF TITLES OF PAPERS displaying consistently higher figures for all five decade - years ( the differences are statistically significant ) , a fact which is probably explained by its close relationship with the field of education , a clear and indubitable social sciences field . One may speculate that the above - mentioned difference between the humanities on one hand , and the sciences and social sciences on the other hand is an inherent feature characteristic of each of those three broad areas of human knowledge , and perhaps related to Storer ' s ( 1967 ) and Price ' s ( 1970 ) classic distinction between " hard " , " soft " and non - sciences . It can be , thus , assumed that the " harder " the field , the more substantive words are needed in its papers ' titles , in order to clearly convey the main thesis of a paper . The specific scientific terminology requires more words in the title , relative to the " free " , more flexible and less specific terminology which prevails in the humanities . Another possible explanation might be the existence of different degrees of awareness , among authors of papers , and perhaps to some extent even among journal editors too , in these three broad areas of knowledge , concerning the importance of title informativity . The smaller emphasis in the humanities fields on title indexes and title - based retrieval might be responsible to some extent for the phenomenon of shorter , less informative titles . Indeed , the general trend of longer , more informative titles began before the KWIC indexes became common . However , since authors in the humanities fields were less exposed to these indexes than their colleagues in the sciences and social sciences , less attention was devoted to the need for title informativity , and consequently , the growth - rate of title - length in the humanities was much lower than in the sciences and social sciences . Further research is needed , however , in more journals from the sciences , social sciences and humanities , in order to firmly establish group averages for each of these broad areas , thus reaching more solid conclusions . Conclusions 1 . Our hypothesis about one single pattern of paper title length for all humanities journals checked , was not confirmed . 2 . However , as a group , these journals showed throughout the last fifty years a significant increase in title informativity , as defined by number of substantive words included in titles . 3 . Assuming that the eighteen journals checked represent the humanities , one may conclude that informativity of paper titles in journals in the humanities , as measured by the number of substantive words in the title , is lower than that found in joumals in the sciences and the social sciences . Scientometrics 38 ( 1997 ) 227 M . YITZHAKI : INFORMATIVITY OF TITLES OF PAPERS 4 . Further research is needed concerning groups of journals from the sciences , the social sciences , and the humanities , in order to re - examine our findings and conclusions , and to reach more solid conclusions regarding the question of title informativity . Future studies should preferably concentrate on close groups of journals covering the same subject field , to check for possible patterns typical of certain fields , and to investigate further relationship between the extent of title informativity and Price ' s distinction between hard and soft sciences .
