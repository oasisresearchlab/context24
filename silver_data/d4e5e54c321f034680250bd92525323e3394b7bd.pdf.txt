In this review , we examine the critical role phosphoino - sitides play in these processes to execute the establishment and maintenance of cellular architecture . Epithelial tissues perform essential barrier and transport functions in almost all major organs . Key to their development and function is the establishment of epithelial cell polarity . We placea specialemphasis on highlightingrecent studies demonstrating phos - phoinositide regulation of epithelial cell polarity and how individual cells use phosphoino - sitides to further organize into epithelial tissues . P hosphoinositides ( PIs ) are essential compo - nents of cellular membranes in eukaryotes . Though these specialized lipids comprise less than 1 % of the cellular lipid cohort , they play key roles in many fundamental biological proc - esses ( Di Paolo and De Camilli 2006 ; Saarikan - gas et al . 2010 ) . PIs possess such far ranging roles by serving as specialized membrane dock - ing sites foreffectors of numerous cellular signal transduction cascades . PIs also serve as pre - cursors of lipid second messengers . They are concentrated on the cytosolic face of cellular membranes ( Fig . 1A ) and rapidly diffuse within the plane of the membrane . Reversible phos - phorylation of the myo - inositol head group of phosphatidylinositol ( PtdIns ) at positions 3 , 4 , and 5 ( Fig . 1B ) gives rise to the seven PI iso - forms identiﬁed in eukaryotic cells . PtdIns ( 4 ) P and PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 are constitutively present in membranes and comprise the largest pool of cellular PIs , whereas PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 is es - sentially undetectable in most types of un - stimulated cells ( Lemmon and Ferguson 2000 ; Saarikangas et al . 2010 ) . The spatiotemporally regulated production and turnover of phosphoinositides is crucial for localized PI signaling and function . Numer - ous phosphatidylinositol kinases and phospha - tases are involved in regulating the metabolism of the various PI isoforms ( Fig . 1 ) . The con - certed action of PI kinases and phosphatases , that attach or remove phosphate groups respec - tively , and phospholipases , that cleave lipids , results in the generation of unique PI enrich - ment in distinct intracellular membranes ( Di Paolo and De Camilli 2006 ; Kutateladze 2010 ) . Individual PIs can then serve as a unique lipid signature or code for cellular organelle identity .

PIs FINE - TUNE CELLULAR SIGNALING PIs integrate cellular signaling by acting as membrane designations for selective protein recruitment and assembly , thereby triggering downstream signaling cascades . PI - mediated signal speciﬁcation occurs by a coincidence de - tection mechanism , whereby initial low afﬁn - ity interaction of cytosolic proteins with PIs is ampliﬁed by cooperative association with one or more additional proteins and / or lipids within the membrane , the net result being enhanced membrane protein afﬁnity ( Di Paolo and De Camilli 2006 ; Saarikangas et al . 2010 ) . These PI - protein interaction domains serve as signaling centers and frequently result in changes in actomyosin dynamics at the mem - brane – cytoskeleton interface . PI effectors , though diverse , share some basic design features that enable them to inter - pret the unique membrane signature , the “PI code” ( Kutateladze 2010 ) . The initial discovery of selective PI binding by the pleckstrin homol - ogy ( PH ) domain of protein effectors was a turning point in our understanding of PI con - trol of cellular signaling ( Harlan et al . 1994 ) . To date 11 PI - binding modules are known that selectively interact with unique PIs withvariable afﬁnity ( Fig . 1C ) ( reviewed in Kutateladze 2010 ) . The selective interaction of the differ - entially phosphorylated head groups of the PI with proteins containing one or more of these PI binding modules is the foundation for PI involvement in numerous cellular processes ( Lemmon 2008 ) . Multiple interactions between PIs and effector proteins , in combination with their unique subcellular distribution , generates a robust and powerful mechanism to spatio - temporally ﬁne - tune the composition of the membrane – cytosol interface , providing intri - cate control of cellular signaling potential . SMALL GTPases AND PHOSPHOINOSITIDES One well established group of PI effector proteins is the large Ras superfamily of small GTPase proteins . These proteins function as molecular switches that cycle between active , GTP bound , and inactive , GDP bound forms to regulate cellular functions as diverse as trafﬁcking , polarity , cell cycle regulation , and Figure 1 . Phosphoinositide subcellular distribution , metabolism , and protein effectors . ( A ) Subcellular distri - bution of PI species .

PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 andPtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 areenrichedat theplasma membrane , possibly in raft - like domains . PtdIns ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 dominates in early endocytic membranes and at the plasma mem - brane . PtdIns ( 3 ) P is concentrated on early endosomal ( EE ) membranes , and the multivesicular body ( MVB ) compartment . PtdIns ( 4 ) P isenriched at the Golgi complex andin Golgi - derived carriers . PtdIns ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 concen - trates on late compartments of the endocytic pathway , the MVB , and lysosome . PtdIns ( 5 ) P is localized in the nucleus , and generation of nuclear PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is key to regulating some aspects of gene expression ( reviewed in Barlow et al . 2009 ) . Parallels can be drawn between the generation of front – rear axis in migrating cells and apical – basal polarity in polarized cell types ( for recent review , see Nelson 2009 ) .

Ras superfamily proteins are fre - quently associated with membranes in which , upon activation , they recruit avarietyof effector proteins to execute their diverse tasks ( ten Klooster and Hordijk 2007 ) . The activity status of small GTPases is primarily controlled by two classes of proteins , GTPase - activating proteins ( GAPs ) and guanine nucleotide - exchange fac - tors ( GEFs ) . Acommon feature of manyof these regulatory proteins is the presence of PI binding domains , such as PH , FYVE , and BAR domains . Consequently , the spatiotemporal activity of many small GTPases is intimately linked with PI signaling . Furthermore , a number of small GTPase effectors are also involved in PI metab - olism ( Di Paolo and De Camilli 2006 ) . This endows these small GTPases with the capacity to participate in feedback loops and cross talk with other PI signaling pathways . The Ras superfamily can be further subdi - vided into ﬁve families : Ras , Rab , Ran , Rho , and Arf . Despite the considerable amount of functional diversity within each of these sub - families , they are broadly characterized as par - ticipating in different cellular processes . For example , the Ras family of GTPases generally participate in proliferation , differentiation , and migration ( Goldﬁnger 2008 ) the Arf and Rab families are commonly associated with vesicle trafﬁcking and organelle structure ( Beh - nia and Munro 2005 ; D’Souza - Schorey and Chavrier 2006 ) ; and Rho - family members are thought to regulate the cytoskeleton ( Heasman and Ridley 2008 ) . The many studies document - ing the intersection of different Ras superfamily small GTPases and PI signaling are beyond the scope of this review . In the following sections , we will attempt to highlight speciﬁc small GTPases when they are relevant to PI signaling and the establishment of cellular architecture , with an emphasis on the well - studied members of the Rho family : RhoA , Rac1 , and Cdc42 . PI CONTROL OF MEMBRANE IDENTITY PI involvement in specifying the subcellular identity of membranes has been studied exten - sively ( Di Paolo and De Camilli 2006 ) . Polarized cell types use PI asymmetry at their plasma membrane as a way to generate and maintain polarity . PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 is restricted to the tip of the growing axon ( Shi et al . 2003 ) and leading edge in neurons and migrating cells respectively . Conversely , PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is concentrated at the trailing membrane of migrating cells . Epithelial cells constitute another type of polarized cyto - architecture with an apical and basolateral PM separated by tight junction protein com - plexes . It is now clear that PIs also play essential roles in the establishment and maintenance of epithelial polarity . Because of the importance of epithelial polarity to overall tissue architec - ture and organ development , and because PI involvement in neurons and migrating cells has been reviewed elsewhere ( Cain and Ridley 2009 ; Tahirovic and Bradke 2009 ) , we focus on PI speciﬁcation of epithelial membrane identity . A general link between PI signaling and epi - thelial polarity has been known for some time ( Khwaja et al . 1998 ; Liu et al . 2004 ; Rosario and Birchmeier 2004 ) . However , not until later work , on polarized Madin – Darby canine kid - ney ( MDCK ) cells , did a detailed picture of PI speciﬁcation of epithelial cell membrane iden - tity emerge ( Gassama - Diagne et al . 2006 ) . The investigators showed that PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 was normally restricted to the basolateral surface of polarized epithelial cells . Furthermore , the exogenous addition of PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 to the apical surface of cells transformed the identity of this membrane to basolateral , as assayed by the recruitment of phosphatidyl inositol - 3 kinase ( PI ( 3 ) - kinase ) and other basolateral proteins , concomitant with the exclusion of apical proteins . PI ( 3 ) - kinase is an enzyme responsible for the conversion of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 to PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 . Treatment of polarized MDCK cells with PI ( 3 ) - kinase inhibitors reduced basolateral surface area and the height of cells , further demonstrating the requirement for PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 in basolateral membrane identity . Another study conﬁrmed the impor - tance of PI ( 3 ) - kinase signaling in regulating epithelial cell basolateral surface production and concluded that this regulation is independ - ent of effects on polarity and adhesion , but could be mediated through Rac1 signaling ( Jeanes et al . 2009 ) .

The answer to this question has emerged from the study of MDCK cells grown in three - dimensional ( 3D ) culture . These cells form polarized cysts with a centrally located apical surface and ﬂuid ﬁlled lumen ( O’Brien et al . 2002 ) . Analysis of lumen forma - tion in this model system provides an excellent assay for the ability of cells to form the apical domain . During the early stages of cyst forma - tion , PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 became concentrated at the apical surface of cells ( Martin - Belmonte et al . 2007 ) . PTEN , a lipid phosphatase that removes phosphate from the 3 position of PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 , also strongly localized to the apical surface of cells during cell polarization and lumen formation . PTEN is a tumor sup - pressor that functionally antagonizes PI ( 3 ) - kin - ase signaling . Importantly , reduction of PTEN activity caused defects in the segregation of PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 and PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and disrup - tion of lumen formation . Analogous to the shift in membrane identity following addition of exogenous PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 to the apical surface , delivery of exogenous PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 to the basolateral surface of cysts caused lumen shrinkage and ectopic recruitment of apical PM proteins , indicative of a change in mem - brane identity . It is unclear how widespread the use of PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 to specify the basolateral do - main and PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 to specify the apical domain is across the many different types of epithelial cells found in different organisms ; however , a high degree of conservation is sug - gested by the localization of PTEN and PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 to the apical membrane of Droso - phila embryonic epithelia ( von Stein et al . 2005 ; Pilot et al . 2006 ) . However , it is important to note that PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 may not always be strictly localized to the basolateral domain . There are likely to be PI microdomains found within the greater apical and basolateral sur - faces to carry out speciﬁc functions . In a specialized Drosophila photoreceptor cell , PTEN is localized to cell – cell junctions where it functions to restrict PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 to the apical membrane domain ( Pinal et al . 2006 ) . This photoreceptor domain is a modiﬁed cilia , which is a specialized organelle distinct from the bulk of the apical membrane ( Reiter and Mostov 2006 ) . Therefore , it is likely that ﬁne tuning of both the levels and localization of PIs allows cells a degree of freedom to create specialized membrane domains to serve a wide variety of purposes . Taken together , the above studies point to a critical function of PIs in epithelial cell mem - brane identity speciﬁcation ( Fig . 2 ) . Less under - stood is how these PI asymmetries are initially established and coordinated with early polar - ization events . Work by many labs has led to a general model for the acquisition of epithelial polarity via signaling generated through cell interactions with the surrounding extracellular matrix ( ECM ) ( O’Brien et al . 2002 ) . b 1 - integ - rin is a critical component of this signaling pathway in MDCK cells and is a known modu - lator of PI ( 3 ) - kinase and PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 levels ( Parise et al . 2000 ; Yu et al . 2005 ) . Consequently , it is plausible to think that speciﬁcation of ba - solateral membrane identity through the gen - eration of integrin - mediated PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 production constitutes one of the earliest steps in epithelial polarization . E - cadherin - mediated PI ( 3 ) - kinase activation following cell – cell con - tact formation could also provide a signiﬁcant source of PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 during initial polar - ization ( Kovacs et al . 2002 ) . Whatever the source , PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 can then function to recruit effectors , such as Rac1 , that establish the axis of polarity and assign basolateral identity to the membrane . PI INVOLVEMENT IN APICAL DOMAIN BIOGENESIS The temporal and molecular relationship be - tween apical surface speciﬁcation and the initial establishment of the apico - basolateral polarity axis , initiated by cell – ECM interac - tions , remains unclear ; however , it appears that these two events are separable because the Phosphoinositides in Cell Architecture Cite this article as Cold Spring Harb Perspect Biol 2011 ; 3 : a004796 5 Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press at University of California , San Francisco , Library on December 6 , 2012 - http : / / cshperspectives . cshlp . org / Downloaded from loss of components affecting apical surface for - mation , such as PTEN , does not affect axis of polarity . Despite this lack of clarity , a number of studies have begun to address the mecha - nisms by which PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is generated at the nascent apical surface and the downstream signaling events required for apical surface expansion and lumen formation . As discussed above , PTEN is an important regulator of apical membrane identity . How then is PTEN localization controlled in polariz - ing cells ? The evolutionarily conserved PAR / aPKC complex is a tripartite complex that regu - lates polarity in embryos , neurons , epithelia , and migrating cells ( Suzuki and Ohno 2006 ; Lee and Vasioukhin 2008 ) . Bazooka ( Baz or PAR - 3 in mammals ) is the ﬁrst protein of the PAR / aPKC complex to show asymmetric local - ization to the apical cortex during epithelial polarity establishment ( Harris and Peifer 2005 ) . An initial clue that the Baz / PAR - 3 scaf - folding protein could play an important role in the regulation of PI signaling was the obser - vation that it directly binds to PTEN through its PDZ domains ( von Stein et al . 2005 ) . Addi - tional work shows that the interaction between PAR - 3 and PTEN was conserved in mammals and necessary for the establishment of epithelial polarity ( Feng et al . 2008 ) . Interestingly , two recent studies have reported that Baz / PAR - 3 can bind directly to PIs in ﬂies and mammals ( Wu et al . 2007 ; Krahn et al . 2010 ) .

PI ( 3 ) - kinase generated PIP3 ( PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ) at the basolateral surface contributes to apico - basal polarity speciﬁcation . This is coordinated with PTEN and PI ( 5 ) - kinase enrichment of PIP2 ( PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) at the apical surface . A PTEN / PIP2 / Anx2 / Cdc42 pathway links the production of PIP2 to actin reorganization during apical membrane biogenesis and lumen formation . A .

Both groups showed an ability for Baz / PAR - 3 binding to PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 and PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . The Baz / PAR - 3 PI binding region was also necessary and sufﬁcient for cortical localization and is required for proper mammalian PAR - 3 func - tion in epithelia . These ﬁndings point to a key role for Baz / PAR - 3 in the integration of phos - phoinositide signaling during polarization . In this context , Baz / PAR - 3 could recruit PTEN to the membrane by binding PIs . This would then lead to removal of the basolateral identify - ing PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 and localized production of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 resulting in the establishment of apical membrane identity ( Fig . 2 ) . In this sce - nario , other factors would still be needed to reﬁne Baz / PAR - 3 localization to a speciﬁc region of the cortex in concert with apico - basal axis speciﬁcation and junction formation . Without these additional factors , Baz / PAR - 3 would be expected to localize indiscriminately at PIs over the entire plasma membrane . A point worth considering is that PTEN is unlikely to be the only regulator of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 during apical membrane speciﬁ - cation . It might therefore be more accurate to think of PTEN function as simply preventing PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 accumulation at the apical sur - face than as a major source of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . Consistent with this idea is the observation that phosphatidylinositol 5 - kinase ( PI ( 5 ) - kin - ase ) , a kinase known to stimulate PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 production , localized to the apical region of MDCK cells and increased biosynthetic delivery of apical proteins ( Guerriero et al . 2006 ) . There are likely to be additional mechanisms to gener - ate and amplify apical PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 that await discovery . Following establishment of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 asymmetry , biogenesis of the apical surface and lumen must be coupled with reorganiza - tion of the cytoskeleton . The actin cytoskeleton in particular becomes highly enriched in the subapical region of epithelial cells during lumen formation and is required for numerous cellu - lar processes such as vesicle trafﬁcking and junction formation / stability . Annexins could provide a critical link between PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and cytoskeletal reorganization . Anx2 binds PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and is recruited to sites of actin assembly ( Rescher et al . 2004 ) . During MDCK cyst formation , disruption of Anx2 function compromised lumen formation in a similar manner to loss of PTEN ( Martin - Belmonte et al . 2007 ) . Anx2 was localized to the apical sur - face of cells in developing cysts and delivery of exogenous PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 to the basal surface of cysts resulted in ectopic recruitment of Anx2 to this surface . Although there are likely to be other effectors of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 at the api - cal membrane , these results point to a potential role of Annexins in PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - dependent apical actin remodeling . An additional connec - tion between Anx2 and the actin cytoskeleton came from the observation that Anx2 binds the Rho - family small GTPase Cdc42 , a known modulator of actin . Support for a Cdc42 role in this process was further shown by RNAi of Cdc42 , which disrupted the apical actin cyto - skeleton and caused similar lumen formation defects to reduction of Anx2 and PTEN . Collec - tively , these results deﬁne a molecular pathway , involving PTEN / Anx2 / Cdc42 , that link the production of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 to actin reorgan - ization during apical membrane biogenesis and lumen formation ( Fig . 2 ) . There are several possible models for how Cdc42 and the actin cytoskeleton might regu - late lumen formation ( Martin - Belmonte and Mostov 2007 ) . The presence of large intracellu - lar vacuoles following disruption of the PTEN / Anx2 / Cdc42 pathway indicates that there could be defects in vesicle trafﬁcking and exocytosis at the apical surface . This model ﬁts with Cdc42’s regulation of exocytosis ( Kroschewski et al . 1999 ; Musch et al . 2001 ; Rojas et al . 2001 ; Wu et al . 2008 ) . Because Cdc42 is known to bind PAR - 6 and regulate PAR / aPKC localization , it is also possible that compromised aPKC activity leads to defects in lumen formation ( Munro 2006 ) . Interestingly , normal aPKC activity is required to restrict PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 to the basal surface ( Takahama et al . 2008 ) . This highlights a potential mechanism for reinforcement or ampliﬁcation of initial PTEN generated PI Phosphoinositides in Cell Architecture Cite this article as Cold Spring Harb Perspect Biol 2011 ; 3 : a004796 7 Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press at University of California , San Francisco , Library on December 6 , 2012 - http : / / cshperspectives . cshlp . org / Downloaded from asymmetry . Last , a role for Cdc42 activity in mitotic spindle positioning and lumen forma - tion has recently been described ( Jaffe et al . 2008 ; Schluter et al . 2009 ; Rodriguez - Fraticelli et al . 2010 ) . Intersectin 2 , a Cdc42 - speciﬁc GEF , was proposed to regulate Cdc42 - depend - ent spindle positioning and lumen formation ; however , there are probably other regulators of Cdc42 , because RNAi of Intersectin 2 does not recapitulate the strong apical membrane biogen - esis defects and accumulation of vacuoles seen when total Cdc42 levels are reduced . An RNAi screen of 70 Rho - family GEFs identiﬁed the Cdc42 GEF , Tuba , as well as a number of addi - tional potential regulators of Cdc42 , that also function in lumen formation ( Qin et al . 2010 ) . DYNAMIC STABILITY : PI CONTROL OF ACTIN ASSEMBLY AND ORGANIZATION As discussed above , Rho - family GTPases are a major class of PI effector and the net outcome of many PI signaling events is to reorganize the cytoskeleton via spatiotemporal regulation of actin machinery . Key to regulated cell shape changes during morphogenesis is the actin cytoskeleton . The actin cytoskeleton is a dy - namic scaffold that underpins a diverse array of cellular processes in eukaryotes . Actin - dependent processes typically involve dynamic membrane reorganization that is achieved by spatiotemporally controlled interplay between the plasma membrane and the underlying cor - tical actin cytoskeleton ( Vicente - Manzanares et al . 2009 ; Martin 2010 ) . Such control of the cortical actomyosin network is achieved via tightly controlled actin ﬁlament turnover and organization and regulation of myosin - II activ - ity . Polymerization and myosin - II - mediated reorganization of actin ﬁlaments provides cellu - lar force to drive assembly , maintenance and remodeling of cell – cell contacts ( Schwartz and DeSimone 2008 ) . We will not provide a detailed review of actin machinery here , as this has been reviewed recently ( Kurisu and Takenawa 2009 ; Padrick and Rosen 2010 ; Saarikangas et al . 2010 ) . Instead , we highlight how PI control of actin machinery contributes to adherens junc - tion ( AJ ) stability ( Fig . 3 ) . Branched Actin Networks A large number of proteins come together to generate new actin ﬁlaments and many of these proteins interact directly with PIs . Arp2 / 3 ( a nucleation promoting factor ) activation is controlled by small GTPases , Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ) - family proteins and phosphoinositides ( Saarikangas et al . 2010 ) . WASP exists in an autoinhibited conformation ( Miki et al . 1998 ) . The mechanism of WASP - family protein regulation involves overcoming an autoinhibitory intramolecular interaction and subsequent oligomerization to drive Arp2 / 3 - dependent actin assembly ( Padrick et al . 2008 ) . N - WASP is allosterically activated and oligomerized by binding to PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and GTP - Cdc42 ( Prehoda et al . 2000 ; Rohatgi et al . 2000 ) . Interestingly other WASP - family pro - teins , WAVE / Scar proteins , act somewhat simi - larly mechanistically to WASP proteins except theyare not autoinhibited ( Macheskyet al . 1999 ) and are activated by Rac and PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ( Padrick and Rosen 2010 ) . So , PI asymmetries can differentially direct actin nucleation , but how do these complexes contribute to stability of AJs ? The ability of cells to turn over their junc - tions and thus respond to external stimuli dur - ing development is in part achieved by endocytosis and recycling of cadherin to the cell surface ( Cavey and Lecuit 2009 ; Nelson 2009 ) . PAR polarity proteins are essential for appropriate control of cytoskeletal , and thus cellular , polarity in a wide variety of polarized cell types ( Mertens et al . 2005 ; Nishimura et al . 2005 ; Zhang and Macara 2006 , 2008 ; Peg - tel et al . 2007 ; Nakayama et al . 2008 ; St Johnston and Ahringer 2010 ) . Baz / Par interaction with the Rac - GEF , TIAM , regulates actin dynamics in a number of different systems ( Nishimura et al . 2005 ; Zhang and Macara 2006 ; Heasman and Ridley 2008 ) , and contributes to TJ for - mation in epithelia ( Chen and Macara 2005 ; Mertens et al . 2005 ; Gopalakrishnan et al . 2007 ) . Recent studies in Drosophila show the critical role of Cdc42 , WASP , Arp2 / 3 , and actin in AJ dynamics . Cdc42 , PAR - 6 , and aPKC regu - late junctional maintenance and integrity by A .

These mechanisms are likely conserved in mammalian epithelia ( Shen and Turner 2008 ) . Importantly , mutation of Rac and SCAR did not produce the same effects on cadherin distribution as observed on loss of Cdc42 ( Georgiou et al . 2008 ) . Further , Rac - WAVE - dependent actin polymerization is required for organization and maintenance of cell – cell contacts ( Yamazaki et al . 2007 ) and high - afﬁnity WAVE activity is restricted to sites of PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 enrichment—namely , the basolateral surface ( Suetsugu et al . 2006 ) . More recently the apical polarity proteins Cdc42 , PAR - 6 , aPKC , and Baz / PAR - 3 were shown to act together with the Rac - GEF , Sif / TIAM , to deﬁne the type of membrane protru - sion generated by Rac / WAVE / SCAR - Arp2 / 3 machinery along the apical – basal axis ( Geor - giou and Baum 2010 ) .

Con - sidered collectively , the unique subcellular distribution of PIs controls the differential recruitment of subsets of actin assembly machi - nery to tune the membrane – actin interface to dynamically regulate AJ stability . Contractile Actomyosin Networks Nonmuscle myosin II ( NM - II ) plays a crucial role in processes that involve cell shape changes and movement , including cell adhesion , migra - tion , cytokinesis , and differentiation , to name but a few . Although the contribution of me - chanical force to developmental and normal physiology is well established , the exact molec - ular mechanisms used by cells to sense and respond to changing environmental stimuli is comparatively less well understood ( Lopez et al . 2008 ; Martin 2010 ) . The role for actomyo - sin generated mechanical force and contractility in regulating individual cellular behaviors and cooperative cellular behavior in tissue mor - phogenesis and function are areas of ongoing intense investigation ( Bershadsky et al . 2006 ; Schwartz and DeSimone 2008 ; Vicente - Manza - nares et al . 2009 ) . Here we consider how NM - II contributes to cellular force transmission under PI control . NM - II is an actin - binding protein family that cross links actin ﬁlaments , and is regulated by heavy and light chain phosphorylation ( Vicente - Manzanares et al . 2009 ) . The actin cross - linking and contractile capacity of NM - II ﬁlaments enables NM - II to control the as - sembly and concomitantly the tensile capacity of the actin cytoskeleton that is intimately involved in tissue organization ( Fernandez - Gonzalez and Zallen 2009 ; Harris and Tepass 2010 ) . There are key kinetic differences and upstream regulatory pathways that in part explain the unique cellular functionality of the different NM - II motors ( Kovacs et al . 2003 ; Wang et al . 2003 , 2010 ; Bao et al . 2007 ; Smutny et al . 2010 ) . Dozens of kinases have been re - ported that reversibly phosphorylate the regu - latory light chains ( RLCs ) of NM - II . Among this group are the Rho - associated , coiled coil kinase ( ROCK ) proteins that are major effectors of the Rho signaling pathway . The two ROCK isoforms are highly homologous , apart from their PH domains , and act on the same cellular substrates ( Yoneda et al . 2005 , 2007 ) . ROCKII recruitment to the membrane is GTP - RhoA dependent ( Sin et al . 1998 ) and the PH domain of ROCKII bound PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ( Yoneda et al . 2005 ) . Therefore , membrane recruitment of ROCKII downstream from Rho could depend on localized PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 enrich - ment . In knockout mice studies , ROCKI was unable to compensate for loss of ROCKII ( Thumkeo et al . 2003 ) , arguing that ROCKs regulate discrete cellular NM - II pools . Collec - tively , these studies indicate that subcellular tar - geting by differential PI binding restricts ROCK isoform activity , affording spatial control of actin organization . The orientation of cellular polarity , particu - larly in epithelial tissues , depends on the inter - actions of the cell with the ECM ( Lopez et al . 2008 ) . Important insights into how cells iden - tify and interpret the polarizing cues coming from the ECM have been obtained from studies of epithelial cells grown in 3D ( Yu et al . 2005 ; O’Brien et al . 2006 ; Liu et al . 2007 ) . These stud - ies support a role for Rac1 , PI ( 3 ) - kinase , and b 1 - integrin / ECM engagement in establishing pole of polarity . Appropriate ECM organization is dependent on the actin cytoskeleton and Rho activity . In the b 1 - integrin blocked 3D model , selective depletion of the ROCK isoforms revealed a differential requirement for ROCKI in establishing pole of polarity downstream of cell - ECM engagement . Because inversion of polarity has been observed invivo during tumor progression ( Adams et al . 2004 ) , these studies provide important mechanistic insight into the pathway underlying this clinically relevant process . The pathway that establishes pole of polarity could be coupled to the pathway that generates the apical surface , the PTEN / Annexin / Cdc42 axis mentioned above . ROCK activity is a likely candidate because it contributes to both PAR - 3 and PTEN function ( Fig . 3 ) . ROCK phosphorylation of PAR - 3 disrupted PAR - 3 / aPKC / PAR - 6 complex formation in migrating cells , spatially controlling TIAM - mediated Rac A . Shewan et al . 10 Cite this article as Cold Spring Harb Perspect Biol 2011 ; 3 : a004796 Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press at University of California , San Francisco , Library on December 6 , 2012 - http : / / cshperspectives . cshlp . org / Downloaded from activity ( Nakayama et al . 2008 ) . Zallen and col - leagues reported a mechanism whereby ROCK regulates the Baz / PAR - 3 PI interaction , thus controlling Baz / PAR - 3 associationwith the cor - tex ( Simoes Sde et al . 2010 ) . PAR - 3 recruits PTEN to establish epithelial polarity ( Feng et al . 2008 ) . The RhoA / ROCK pathway is known to enhance PTEN phosphatase activity ( Li et al . 2005 ) . PTEN stability and activity is regulated by phosphorylation of the carboxy - terminal tail and by interactions with speciﬁc binding partners ( Leslie et al . 2008 ) . Of note PTEN protein levels are controlled by AJ associ - ation and PTEN in turn stabilizes AJs ( Kotele - vets et al . 2005 ; Subauste et al . 2005 ; Li et al . 2007 ; Fournier et al . 2009 ) . Interestingly , a direct link between PTEN and ROCKI was shown in primary bone marrow macrophages , in which ROCKI was required for PTEN stabili - zation , phosphorylation , and activity ( Vemula et al . 2010 ) . Collectively , these studies suggest an integral role , and perhaps a point of conver - gence , for ROCK in regulation of acquisition of polarity and membrane speciﬁcation . Recruit - ment of PAR - 3 and PTEN to the cortex via binding of PIs contributes to cellular polariza - tion , if we couple this with ROCK - mediated regulation of Rho - GTPase / PAR complex for - mation and PTEN stability , we add another layer of regulation to the polarization machin - ery . Future research will determine the exact molecular mechanisms involved . PI CONTROL OF JUNCTIONAL STABILITY Key to polarization are the development of adherens junctions ( AJs ) and tight junctions ( TJs ) that regulate cell – cell adhesion ( Wang and Margolis 2007 ) . PAR - 3 is a critical determi - nant of cellular polarity , acting to control actin assembly and the development of tight and adherens junctions . In addition to interacting with PTEN , Baz / PAR - 3 also interacts with components of the nectin - and cadherin - based adhesion machinery to promote cadherin clus - tering , a well - recognized determinant of cad - herin adhesive strengthening ( Leckband and Prakasam 2006 ; Harris and Tepass 2010 ) . Dur - ing the early stages of intestinal epithelial cell polarization in C . elegans , cortical foci con - taining PAR - 3 recruit E - cadherin , PAR - 6 , and aPKC ( Achilleos et al . 2010 ) . Furthermore , appropriate positioning of Baz is critical to deﬁning the apical / lateral border ( Morais - de - Sa et al . 2010 ) . PAR - 3 also interacts directly with PIs ( Wu et al . 2007 ) . Collectively , these observations place differential PI driven polar - ity protein complex regulation at the core of cellular membrane asymmetry and domain ampliﬁcation . How cell – cell adhesions are es - tablished and coordinated with polarity has been the focus of a number of recent reviews ( Suzuki and Ohno 2006 ; Goldstein and Macara 2007 ; Martin - Belmonte and Rodriquez - Frati - celli 2009 ; St Johnston and Ahringer 2010 ) , here we consider PI regulation of junctional stability and the emerging role of AJs as mechanosensors . AJs AS MECHANOSENSORS How does the actin cytoskeleton contribute to AJ stability and cellular mechanosensing ? Many labs have reported that NM - II activity is required for adherens junction organization and stability ( Shewan et al . 2005 ; Ivanov et al . 2007 ; Yamada and Nelson 2007 ; Vicente - Manzanares et al . 2009 ; Smutny et al . 2010 ) . Yet the molecular mechanisms that underlie integration of contractile force at cell – cell adhe - sions are less well deﬁned , although recent research provides some clues ( Fig . 3 ) . NM - II - dependent recruitment of vinculin to AJs revealed a mechanosensing role for E - cadherin ( le Duc et al . 2010 ) . Yonemura and colleagues showed an NM - II - dependent mechanism for stabilization of AJs that involves a force - dependent interaction between vinculin and a - catenin ( Miyake et al . 2006 ; Yonemura et al . 2010 ) . Further , direct application of an exoge - nous tugging force was sufﬁcient , in addition to myosin activity , to trigger AJ formation and stabilization ( Liu et al . 2010 ) . Interestingly , vin - culin controls PTEN protein levels by modulat - ing the interaction of the E - cadherin binding protein , b - catenin , with membrane - associated guanylate - kinase 2 ( MAGI - 2 ) ( Subauste et al . 2005 ) . Vinculin is recruited to the membrane Phosphoinositides in Cell Architecture Cite this article as Cold Spring Harb Perspect Biol 2011 ; 3 : a004796 11 Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press at University of California , San Francisco , Library on December 6 , 2012 - http : / / cshperspectives . cshlp . org / Downloaded from by association with PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( Palmer et al . 2009 ) . Whether stretch activation of a - catenin and associated vinculin binding is required to stabilise the b - catenin / MAGI interaction , thus controlling PTEN protein levels and PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , is an open question . These stud - ies highlight the complex interplay between force and adhesion and how translation of mul - tiple signals into actomyosin - generated force at cell – cell and cell – ECM contacts collaboratively support global tissue architecture . CYTOSKELETAL CONTROL OF TISSUE ARCHITECTURE How does the interaction of PIs with actin reg - ulatory proteins translate to cell shape changes and subsequent control of tissue architecture ? Important insights have emerged from work in model systems . Actomyosin networks play a central role in the morphogenetic movements that underpin model organism development ( Quintin et al . 2008 ; Martin 2010 ) . Though the contributions of actin and myosin in devel - opmental processes are established , the exact mechanisms by which actomyosin networks drive cell shape changes remain to be fully characterized . Actomyosin networks underlying the cell surface are capable of generating planar tensile forces that contribute to cortical tension . Because PIs are intimately involved in regulat - ing polarity and actin assembly machinery , PIs are likely central players in force integration . Cells employ tensile cortical actin meshworks to balance and respond to forces experienced within the tissue , originating from other cells and the ECM ( Lopez et al . 2008 ) . In response to complex patterns of tension input , the cells respond by locally changing shape to accommo - date changing requirements of the tissue . A key developmental cell shape change is driven by apical constriction . Epithelial cells undergo spa - tially regulated and timed constriction of the apical actomyosin belt to convert columnarcells to a wedge - shaped morphology , which drives folding of the epithelial sheet ( Sawyer et al . 2010 ) . This elegant cellular mechanism under - lies the formation of many epithelial tissue topologies , including : folds , pits , and tubules . Biochemical signals are necessary and sufﬁcient to recruit NM - II to the cortex , though mechan - ical signals play an important role too . Recent studies have provided evidence that mechanical tension is sufﬁcient to recruit NM - II to the apical surface to control actomyosin dynamics ( Blankenship et al . 2006 ; Fernandez - Gonzalez et al . 2009 ; Pouille et al . 2009 ) . Interestingly cortical actomyosin acts as a ratchet , whereby pulsed contractions of the cortical actomyosin network drive and stabilize incremental apical constriction ( Martin et al . 2009 ; Solon et al . 2009 ) . Subsequent work showed that AJs bal - ance the forces generated by the tensile acto - myosin network to transmit tension across the tissue ( Martin et al . 2010 ) . Of particular note , PTEN recruits NM - II to the cortex in response to application of force in Dictyostelium ( Prama - nik et al . 2009 ) . Additionally , Baz and PAR - 6 / aPKC regulate distinct phases of the myosin assembly disassembly cycle during amnioserosa apical constriction during Drosophila dorsal closure ( David et al . 2010 ) . Although , it is pos - sible that apical constriction alone may not be sufﬁcient to induce sheet folding because in - tegration of both circumapical and lateral contraction of the endoderm was required to drive early ascidian gastrulation ( Sherrard et al . 2010 ) . Because NM - II can be recruited to the cortex by tension and by protein inter - actions the involvement of polarity proteins in apical constriction is particularly germane ( Choi and Sokol 2009 ; Hava et al . 2009 ; David et al . 2010 ) . Polarity protein involvement in api - cal constriction suggests that mechanical ten - sion is integrated by modifying the properties of the plasma membrane and , by extension , the PI composition of the cell surface . An in - depth understanding of cellular mechanisms for controlling and responding to force is cru - cial if we are to understand the cellular basis of tissue and organismal development . CONCLUDING REMARKS In this review , we have examined how a group of membrane - associated phospholipids contrib - ute to a wide variety of signaling pathways to A . Shewan et al . 12 Cite this article as Cold Spring Harb Perspect Biol 2011 ; 3 : a004796 Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press at University of California , San Francisco , Library on December 6 , 2012 - http : / / cshperspectives . cshlp . org / Downloaded from control cellular and tissue architecture . Regula - tion of the interconversion of various PIs is able to assign unique membrane identity to epithe - lial cell domains in conjunction with pole of polarity speciﬁcation . Once PI - mediated mem - brane identity is initially established , PIs act by participating in cross - talk and feedback ampli - ﬁcation loops to reinforce membrane identity . PIs are further able to integrate membrane identity with aspects of cellular physiology by recruiting and enriching membranes with downstream effectors that posses PI - binding modules such as PH domains . Frequently , these effectors act to reorganize the cytoskeleton proximal to membrane domains in a manner that helps further deﬁne their unique identity . These cytoskeletal changes play an important part in cell – cell adhesion and the establishment of actomyosin contractility across epithelial sheets that are required for coordinating overall tissue architecture . Epithelial cells play important roles in development and disease . Signiﬁcantly , loss of epithelial cell polarity and tissue architecture is one of the deﬁning hallmarks of cancer and it is estimated that the majority of all cancers are epithelial in origin . Given the essential nature of PI regulation of epithelial cell archi - tecture , it is not surprising that PTEN and PI ( 3 ) - kinase are two of the most frequently mutated genes in cancer ( Bunney and Katan 2010 ) . Consequently , further study of PI regula - tion of epithelial cell polarity will yield impor - tant insight into both the development of this important cell type as well as potential mecha - nisms of oncogenic signaling .
