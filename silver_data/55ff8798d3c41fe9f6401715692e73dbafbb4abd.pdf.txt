Objective : This study compares two maps of biomedical sciences using Medical Subject Headings ( MeSH ) term co - assignments versus MeSH terms of citing / cited articles and reveals similarities and differences between the two approaches . Methods : MeSH terms assigned to 397 , 475 journal articles published in 2015 , as well as their 4 , 632 , 992 cited references , were retrieved from Web of Science and MEDLINE databases , respectively , which formed over 7 million MeSH co - assignments and nearly 18 million direct citation pairs . We generated six network visualizations of biomedical science at three levels using Gephi software based on these MeSH co - assignments and citation pairs . Results : The MeSH co - assignment map contained more nodes and edges , as MeSH co - assignments cover all medical topics discussed in articles . By contrast , the MeSH citation map contained fewer but larger nodes and wider edges , as citation links indicate connections to two similar medical topics . Conclusion : These two types of maps emphasize different aspects of biomedical sciences , with MeSH co - assignment maps focusing on the relationship between topics in different categories and MeSH direct citation maps providing insights into relationships between topics in the same or similar category . Keywords : MeSH ; citation ; co - assignment ; map of life sciences ; Gephi INTRODUCTION The purpose of science mapping is to visualize the structure of scientific inquiry [ 1 , 2 ] , which helps us understand the evolution of science [ 3 , 4 ] . Such mapping is generally derived from the metadata of scholarly articles such as author names , journal titles , disciplines , and cited references [ 5 ] ; these elements and their connections form the nodes and edges of networks that can be visualized as maps . Although citation analysis is the dominant method for generating maps of science , other types of information could also be used , such as subject categories , research topics , course descriptions , or subject headings . For instance , expert judgment was first used for mapping science when Bernal drew , by hand , a map of science representing the hierarchical structure of scientific topics [ 6 ] . Small and Griffith then created the first citation - based map of science using co - citation analysis [ 7 ] . Since then , citation analyses—including direct citation , bibliography coupling , and co - citation—have been widely used for mapping science . More recently , other methods have also been used for mapping science . For example , maps of science have been generated based on the co - occurrence of words in titles , abstracts , or keywords using coword analysis [ 8 - 12 ] . Balaban and Klein mapped science using undergraduate course prerequisites at Texas A & M University [ 13 ] . Suominen and Toivanen generated a map of science using topic modeling based on latent patterns in texts retrieved from Web of Science ( WoS ) [ 14 ] . Also , Shu et al . produced a map of science based on nonfiction books and their Library of Congress Subject Headings ( LCSH ) co - assignments [ 15 ] . The Medical Subject Headings ( MeSH ) thesaurus , created and maintained by the National Library of Medicine , is used in MEDLINE / PubMed and other biomedical databases and archives . Around 61 , 000 MeSH terms representing medical topics—from broad to specific—are organized in a hierarchical tree covering sixteen branches that can reach up to fourteen levels of depth . For example , Organisms is classified as a level 1 MeSH term ( category B ) , Aedes is classified as a level 14 442 Shu et al . DOI : dx . doi . org / 10 . 5195 / jmla . 2021 . 1173 Journal of the Medical Library Association 109 ( 3 ) July 2021 jmla . mlanet . org MeSH term , and the hierarchical structure Organisms / Eukaryota / Animals / Invertebrates / Arthropods / Insect a / Pterygota / Neoptera / Holometabola / Diptera / Nematocera / Culico morpha / Culicidae / Aedes represents a branch from the broadest term Organisms to the narrowest term Aedes . As biomedical science is the largest portion of the sciences , most current mapping approaches have been used to map biomedical science as a subset of the map of science . However , few studies apply PubMed’s MeSH to the map of biomedical sciences . Leydesdorff et al . produced a base map using the MeSH categories C ( Diseases ) , D ( Chemicals and Drugs ) , and E ( Analytical , Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques and Equipment ) [ 16 ] . Leydesdorff et al . compared MeSH terms with cited sources among the literature related to Alzheimer disease and found that citations indicate the core structure of research , whereas MeSH terms represent relevance to current research options [ 17 ] . This study aims to contribute to the literature on science mapping by using MeSH [ 18 ] to present the structure and evolution of biomedical sciences . To compare this new mapping approach with the traditional citation - based mapping approach , we produced two maps using MeSH term co - assignments and MeSH terms of citing and cited papers , respectively . As scholarly documents in MEDLINE / PubMed can be assigned multiple MeSH terms , MeSH co - assignments express the likelihood that two medical topics are covered in the same , which allows mapping of the structure and evolution of biomedical sciences . Although this is a promising approach [ 5 ] , no studies have yet generated a MeSH co - assignment – based map of biomedical sciences . Thus this study seeks to answer the following research question : How does a MeSH co - assignment map of biomedical sciences differ from a direct citation - based map using MeSH terms as controlled topics ? METHODS In MEDLINE / PubMed , each medical journal article is indexed with around ten to fifteen MeSH terms representing all topics related to or discussed substantially in the article [ 19 ] . Some of these assigned MeSH terms are designated as major , indicating an article’s primary topics , whereas the others represent topics only discussed in the article . MeSH co - assignments can be used as a measure of the relative strength of the relationship between two MeSH terms , as these co - assignments express the likelihood that existing knowledge about two medical topics will be read together in the same article [ 15 ] . Thus a map of biomedical sciences can be generated on the basis of MeSH co - assignments . A relationship between a citing article and its cited reference can also be established by a citation link . Thus a relationship between MeSH terms ( representing medical topics ) assigned to a citing article and its cited reference can be established by a citation , generating a traditional direct citation - based map using MeSH terms as controlled topics assigned to individual articles . This means that a MeSH - based map of biomedical sciences can be generated by two approaches : ( 1 ) using MeSH co - assignments within the same article , and ( 2 ) using MeSH terms assigned to a citing article and its cited references as controlled topics . MeSH major topics are the major topics of the article , whereas non - major MeSH terms are usually related topics substantively discussed within the article [ 19 ] . The co - occurrence of MeSH major topics and their related non - major MeSH terms represents the relationship between two corresponding medical topics . Thus we used each co - assignment of two MeSH major topics or one MeSH major topic and one non - major MeSH term to generate the MeSH co - assignment map . In addition , considering that a citation represents the relationship between a citing article and its cited reference on the basis of relevant themes [ 20 ] , we used the MeSH major topics of citing articles and their cited references to produce the MeSH direct citation map , representing their shared medical topics . We retrieved 397 , 475 research articles published in 2015 , as well as their 4 , 632 , 992 cited references from WoS . Only those cited references indexed by WoS were included in the dataset . All articles were classified as the discipline Clinical Medicine in the National Science Foundation ( NSF ) classification system , which is a two - level journal classification system consisting of fourteen broad fields and 144 subfields integrated into the WoS database . The NSF classification system exclusively assigns each individual journal into only one single field , as opposed to WoS categories , which assign journals to multiple categories . Next , a version of MEDLINE / PubMed integrated into WoS was used as the linkage between WoS and PubMed , in which a PubMed unique article reference number ( PMID ) and MeSH terms were assigned to each journal article . As not all articles were covered by both WoS and PubMed , only citing articles and cited references with a PMID were included in this study . In total , 349 , 135 citing articles and their 1 , 899 , 457 cited references were included ; 4 , 774 , 345 MeSH terms , including 276 , 677 major MeSH topics , were assigned to the citing articles , and 9 , 111 , 007 MeSH major topics were assigned to the cited references . The maps generated in this study were based on the sixteen level 1 MeSH terms and 118 level 2 MeSH terms . Assigned MeSH terms at level 3 or lower were reassigned to their parent level 2 or grandparent level 1 MeSH terms . For example , for the hierarchical structure of Organisms / Eukaryota / Animals / Invertebrates / Arthropods / Insect a / Pterygota / Neoptera / Holometabola / Diptera / Nematocera / Culico morpha / Culicidae / Aedes , the MeSH terms Animals , Invertebrates , Arthropods , Insecta , Pterygota , Neoptera , Holometabola , Diptera , Nematocera , Culicomorpha , Culicidae , and Aedes were reassigned to Organisms ( level 1 ) or Eukaryota ( level 2 ) when producing the MeSH co - Mapping the biomedical sciences 443 DOI : dx . doi . org / 10 . 5195 / jmla . 2021 . 1173 jmla . mlanet . org 109 ( 3 ) July 2021 Journal of the Medical Library Association assignment map at level 1 or 2 . This method of reassignment to broader or more general abstraction levels has been used in previous studies of library classification mapping , which have confirmed its robustness [ 15 ] . Four datasets ( 4 , 325 , 056 MeSH co - assignments at level 1 , 7 , 492 , 116 MeSH co - assignments at level 2 , 10 , 071 , 906 citation pairs at level 1 , and 17 , 921 , 730 citation pairs at level 2 ) were finalized to produce four maps of biomedical sciences : MeSH co - assignment maps at levels 1 and 2 and MeSH direct citation maps at levels 1 and 2 . For each dataset , MeSH terms , as well as their co - assignments or MeSH citation pairs ( i . e . , MeSH major topics between citing articles and cited references ) , were imported into free graph - drawing software Gephi [ 21 ] to generate a visual map of biomedical sciences . Each MeSH term was a node ( i . e . , circle ) , whereas each MeSH co - assignment or MeSH citation pair was an edge ( i . e . , connecting line ) . The number of assignments of each MeSH term determined the size of a node , whereas the number of MeSH co - assignments or MeSH citation pairs determined the weight of an edge . Although Gephi does not support TXT or RIS files exported from WoS as do other visualization software ( e . g . , VOSviewer , Citespace , Bibexcel ) , it is the only software that has been used for mapping subject headings ( i . e . , LCSH ) [ 15 ] . Therefore , we selected Gephi to visualize MeSH , which is similar to LCSH in terms of format and indexing . In addition to these four maps , we produced a co - assignment map and a direct citation map based on level 2 MeSH terms under category C ( Diseases ) , as these terms represent the basic structure of biomedical science and were used for mapping in a previous study [ 16 ] . There is no strict rule regarding the selection of representative data for visualization [ 22 ] , but thresholds have been frequently used in science mapping [ 23 – 25 ] . Based on the MeSH co - assignment and MeSH citation pair data , two threshold filters ( number of MeSH co - assignments > 1 , 699 , number of MeSH citation pairs > 699 ) were devised and respectively applied to two maps at level 2 to reduce them to a manageable number of visual elements . These thresholds produced two smallest subsets that account for at least 95 % of MeSH co - assignments and MeSH citation pairs , respectively . RESULTS Level 1 map Figure 1 shows two maps of biomedical sciences at the MeSH term level 1 containing sixteen blue nodes / 110 edges ( upper , co - assignment map ) and sixteen green nodes / 116 edges ( lower , direct citation map ) . Nodes are level 1 MeSH terms , while edges represent their relationship ( i . e . , MeSH co - assignments and MeSH citation pairs , respectively ) . Edge width is proportional to the number of co - assignments or citation pairs between the two MeSH terms , and the node and label sizes are proportional to the number of assignments or citations . The shade of nodes / edges is also based on their size or width , as the color of large nodes or wide edges are darker . Figure 1 MeSH co - assignment map ( upper ) and MeSH direct citation map ( lower ) at level 1 444 Shu et al . DOI : dx . doi . org / 10 . 5195 / jmla . 2021 . 1173 Journal of the Medical Library Association 109 ( 3 ) July 2021 jmla . mlanet . org Table 1 Distribution of MeSH terms ( level 1 ) in the co - assignment map and direct citation map For both the co - assignment map and the direct citation map , a strong triangular relationship among Analytical , Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques and Equipment , Health Care , and Phenomena and Processes was found . Indeed , as indicated in Table 1 , seven out of the top ten MeSH terms ( bold ) in both maps were the same , with similar proportions of the total assigned MeSH terms . Some differences were observed ; however , the nodes Name Groups , Diseases , and Organisms were relatively large in the co - assignment map but small in the direct citation map , and the node Psychiatry and Psychology , as well as its links , were stronger in the direct citation map than in the co - assignment map . Level 2 map Figure 2 shows two maps of biomedical sciences at the MeSH term level 2 . In these maps , nodes are level 2 MeSH terms whose colors represent their parent MeSH terms at level 1 , and the edge colors are mixed on the basis of the colors of their source nodes . Although the figure is visually complex due to high connectivity between nodes and overlapping edges , some differences were found when comparing the co - assignment map ( left ) and direct citation map ( right ) . Whereas the distribution of MeSH citation pairs in the direct citation map was skewed , with some large nodes and wide edges , the distribution of MeSH co - assignments was more balanced . Indeed , the average degree ( i . e . , mean number of edges per node ) and graph density ( i . e . , number of edges between nodes relative to the total possible number of edges between nodes ) of the MeSH direct citation map ( 17 . 108 and 0 . 234 , respectively ) were lower than those of the MeSH co - assignment map ( 38 . 922 and 0 . 385 , respectively ) . When comparing the top 10 MeSH terms appearing in both maps , we found no major differences between maps ( Table 2 ) . Eight of the top ten MeSH terms were the same between maps ; however , Persons and Eukaryota appeared more often in the MeSH co - assignment map , whereas Genetic Phenomena and Information Science appeared more often in the MeSH direct citation map . Investigative Techniques and Environment and Public Health were co - assigned or paired most often in both maps , and the top four MeSH co - assignments or citation pairs were the same in both maps ( Table 3 ) . However , Persons appeared in four out of the top 10 MeSH co - assignments in the co - assignment map , whereas Behavior and Behavior Mechanisms and Therapeutics and Surgical Procedures , Operative were only found in top 10 MeSH citation pairs in the direct citation map .

As same as the level 1 map , edge width is proportional to the number of co - assignments or citation pairs , and the node and label sizes are proportional to the number of assignments or citations . The shade of nodes / edges is also based on their size or width , as the color of large nodes or wide edges are darker . All diseases were connected to Pathological Conditions , Signs and Symptoms , which is the largest node and hub in both maps . Some nodes , such as Neoplasms , Cardiovascular Diseases , Nervous System Diseases , and Female Urogenital Diseases and Pregnancy Complications , had strong connections with Pathological Conditions and Signs and Symptoms . DISCUSSION Our results show that MeSH co - assignments and MeSH citation pairs are two different approaches to measuring relationships among medical topics that can show the core structure of biomedical science [ 17 ] ; MeSH co - assignment indicates relationships between topics in different categories ( e . g . , psychology and gender ) , whereas MeSH pairs of citing / cited articles indicate relationships between topics in the same or similar categories . We found that co - assignment mapping and citation pair mapping yielded similar visualizations . MeSH co - assignments include all medical topics discussed in articles , leading to a high - density map containing more nodes and edges . By contrast , MeSH citation pairs indicate a connection between similar medical topics via a citation link , leading to a less dense map consisting of large nodes and wide edges . Named Groups , most often assigned as nonmajor topics , frequently appeared in MeSH co - assignment maps but did not emerge in MeSH direct citation maps , as MeSH citation pairs only represent the relationship between two major medical topics from the respective citing article and cited reference . This difference was also seen in level 2 map ; four strong edges between Person and Investigative Techniques , Environment and Public Health , Health Care Quality , Access , and Evaluation , and Diagnosis were observed in the MeSH co - assignment map but were hardly apparent in the MeSH direct citation map . Figure 3 MeSH co - assignment map ( upper ) and MeSH direct citation map ( lower ) ( Category C only ) 448 Shu et al . DOI : dx . doi . org / 10 . 5195 / jmla . 2021 . 1173 Journal of the Medical Library Association 109 ( 3 ) July 2021 jmla . mlanet . org Such results do not mean that one map is more accurate or representative than the other ; rather , they represent different angles of view of biomedical science . The MeSH co - assignment map shows relationships between topics in different categories , allowing us to observe whether a medical topic is related to a non - medical topic in Name Groups , Geographicals , or Publication Characteristics categories . On the other hand , the MeSH direct citation map shows relationships between topics within the same or similar categories , allowing us to view the core structure of biomedical science . This study has some limitations . As we investigated all medical papers published in a single year , the maps do not show the evolution of biomedical sciences . In addition , cited references not indexed by WoS were excluded from this study ; thus the Open Citation Collection recently introduced by National Institutes of Health [ 26 ] could be a better data source for future studies . In addition , different visualization methodologies , affected by choice of software and algorithms , may also influence the appearance of the map . For example , Song and Chi found that VOSviewer and Citespace produced two different maps based on the same dataset due to their different default settings and clustering methods [ 27 ] . Also , in order to map all disciplines , citation - based maps have to normalize citation data since the citation rate varies among different disciplines , whereas subject headings co - assignment maps can visualize science without data normalization because the number of subject headings assigned is small [ 15 ] . In conclusion , the results of this study could form a foundation for future studies mapping science using subject headings . The comparison between the co - assignment map and direct citation map reflects the fundamental difference between two mapping techniques ; subject headings show knowledge areas that must be learned together , whereas citation links express how one discipline draws knowledge from or builds upon another . Subject heading co - assignments could represent relationships between various research topics in different categories , not only from journal articles but also from non - fiction books and monographs , which broadens our understanding of the relationships between major sub - disciplines of science . In future work , we plan to validate this approach by producing maps based on other data collections .
