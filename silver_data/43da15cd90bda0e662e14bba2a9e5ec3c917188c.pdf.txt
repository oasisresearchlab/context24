Introduction Epilepsy and mental retardation in females ( Mendelian Inheri - tance in Man number 300088 ) is a disorderdescribed some30 years ago [ 1 ] and later reevaluated [ 2 ] , but it remained under - recognized [ 3 ] , and was only recently clari ﬁ ed in terms of its genetic basis [ 4 ] . This early - onset epileptic encephalopathy , exhibiting some clinical overlap with Dravet syndrome , is caused by mutations in the pro - tocadherin19gene ( PCDH19 , MendelianInheritanceinMannumber * 300460 ) on the X - chromosome [ 4 - 6 ] . Only heterozygous females carrying the PCDH19 mutation are affected , whereas transmitting hemizygous males are devoid of seizures or cognitive impairment , making the “ reverse ” X - linked inheritance pattern of epilepsy and mental retardation in females quite remarkable [ 6 , 7 ] . This peculiar inheritance was suggested to be most likely attributable to cellular interference , caused by the coexistence of PCDH19 - positive and PCDH19 - negative cells as a result of random X - inactivation in females [ 5 , 6 ] . The heterogeneous cell population was proposed to scramble processes such as cell - to - cell communication [ 4 , 6 - 8 ] . In familial cases , a PCDH19 mutation may be transmitted through unaffected fathers or inherited from an affected mother , and sporadiccasesareusuallycausedbydenovomutations [ 5 , 9 - 13 ] . The penetrance of epilepsy and mental retardation in females is high , with nonpenetrant carrier females only rarely reported [ 6 , 7 , 14 ] , and not all of them are tested for the PCDH19 gene [ 14 ] . We report on a patient presenting the most typical phenotype of epilepsy and mental retardation in females , and carrying the duplication in exon 5 of PCDH19 inherited from her asymptomatic mother . Case Report This 13 - year - old girl was the ﬁ rst and onlychild of healthy , nonconsanguineous parents of Bulgarian origin with a negative family history . The child was born after a normal pregnancy and delivery , without signs of asphyxia , and she exhibited normal early postnatal development . From 5 months of age , monthly tonic seizures during feveroccurred . Theylastedupto2minutes , and presentedin clusters of 6 - 15 seizures per day for a period of 2 - 4 days . Phenobarbital treatment was initiated without effect . Several electroencephalograms were reported to produce normal results in the interictal state . At age 2 years , phenobarbital was replaced with val - proate , butthetonicseizurespersisted , andher ﬁ rstgeneralizedtonic - clonicseizure was observed . The child walked independently at age 14 months , but expressive language only appeared after 3 years of age . During the patient ’ s ﬁ rst admission at our clinic at age 4 years , 20 tonic and brief tonic - clonic seizures were provoked by a febrile condition lasting 72 hours . Neuropsychologic testing revealed normal receptive language , de ﬁ cient speech , and hyperkinetic and aggressive behavior . Subsequent add - ons of carbamazepine , topiramate , phenytoin , nitrazepam , and lamotrigine remainedineffective . Atage6 years , afebrile seizuresmanifested for the ﬁ rst time . A gradual increase of seizure - free periods was evident , because the usual clusters of seizures occurred at intervals of 50 - 60 days . Cranial computed tomog - raphy and magnetic resonance imaging revealed normal results . Multiple electro - encephalograms indicated frontotemporal epileptiform activity without de ﬁ nite focus , or only background slowing . Moderate intellectual disability was established ( verbal intelligence quotient , 45 ; nonverbal intelligence quotient , 40 ) , and risper - idone treatment was introduced because of the marked behavioral disturbances . * Communications should be addressed to : Dr .

At 8 years of age , while levetiracetam was added to valproate , a continuous increase of seizure - free intervals ( up to 6 months ) was evident . An electroencephalogram revealed slow background without epileptiform activity . Her intelligence quotient de ﬁ cit remained at the same level ( about 40 ) , with severely abnormal behavior of autistic and aggressive type . Because of the aggressive behavior , the child was unable to attend even a special school , and was assigned to the care of her mother . Targeted molecular genetic testing for PCDH19 mutations was performed . GenomicDNAwasobtained fromthepatientandher parents , using commercialkits ( Qiagen , Valencia , CA ) . The exons of the PCDH19 gene were ampli ﬁ ed as previously described [ 5 ] . Whole gene sequencing of PCDH19 was performed with a BigDye TerminatorVersion 3 . 1 Cycle Sequencing Kit ( Applied Biosystems , Foster City , CA ) . It revealed the mutation c . 2705dupA ; p . Asp902Lysfs * 6 ( complementary DNA National Center for Biotechnology Information Reference Sequence , NM _ 001184880 . 1 ) ( Fig 1A ) . The parents were also tested for the mutation . The results , surprisingly , Figure 1 . Genetic sequence of part of exon 5 ( PCDH19 gene ) in the area of the c . 2705dupA mutation in both the patient ( A ) and her mother ( B ) . P . S . Dimova et al . / Pediatric Neurology 46 ( 2012 ) 397 e 400 398 indicated that the mutation was inherited from the unaffected mother ( Figure 1B ) , who was a heterozygous asymptomatic carrier of the mutation . She never man - ifested epileptic seizures and was of normal intelligence ( intelligence quotient , 98 ) , withoutbehavioralproblems . An electroencephalographicexamination , bothawake and during sleep , did not demonstrate any abnormalities . Discussion Comparing the clinical manifestations of our patient with those in previously described series , we think they provide an example of the most typical phenotype of epilepsy and mental retardation in females [ 7 , 11 - 13 ] . The generalized seizures of infantile onset were primarily provoked by fever and at their highest frequency during the ﬁ rst 6 years of age . Seizures occurred in clusters over several days , and did not respond to anticonvul - sant treatment , but rather subsided with age . The neuro - psychologic outcome involved severe impairment because of a moderate intelligence quotient de ﬁ cit and prominent autistic and aggressive behavior . This ﬁ rst Bulgarian PCDH19 - positive case presents some unusual features . On the one hand , most previously reported mutations were clustered in exon 1 of PCDH19 , and in our family , a mutation in exon 5 was discovered , in which only a few mutations have been reported so far [ 7 , 10 ] . As previously emphasized , although alter - ations in this region are not located in the extracellular domains of the protein ( the most crucial for its function ) , they affect the cytoplasmic domains of protocadherins , which also demonstrate a high level of conservation [ 9 , 10 ] . We think our ﬁ nding of a duplication in exon 5 , leading to a frameshift , provides further evidence for the deleterious nature of such rare changes [ 10 ] . The PCDH19 gene encodes an 1148 amino acid protein and contains a signal sequence , six extracellular cadherin repeats , a transmembrane domain , and a cytoplasmic region with conserved cytoplasmic domains 1 and 2 [ 15 ] . Our frameshift mutation leads to a premature protein termination and a deletion of the two conserved cytoplasmic domains . Although the biologic role of the PCDH19 protein remains unclear , the premature termination of protein synthesis could not involve a nonpathogenic variant . The PCDH19 messenger RNAs with mutations introducing premature termination codons were indeed demonstrated to be degraded via the nonsense - mediated mRNA decay surveillance system of the cell in patients ’ ﬁ broblasts [ 4 ] . To interpret our mutation more fully , we compared it with closely situated , previously reported nonsense splice - site muta - tions and duplications , leading to premature protein termination and a loss of cytoplasmic domains ( Table 1 ) [ 7 , 11 ] . All of them caused the phenotype of epilepsy and mental retardation in females , but the clinical manifestations of the different mutations were variable . Cognitive and behavioral features also greatly varied from normal intelligence to moderate mental retardation , with or without autistic features . Typically , however , seizures manifested periodically and in clusters , and most of them were fever - induced . Usually , the outcome of epilepsy was freedom from seizures ( with or without drug treatment ) , or at least a tendency toward increased seizure - free periods . Our mutation caused a phenotype similar to those reported by other authors ( Table 1 ) in respect to seizure manifestations and epilepsy outcomes . Up to the present , patients with epilepsy and mental retar - dation in females have been demonstrated to inherit PCDH19 mutations from their unaffected carrier fathers or ( usually more mildly ) affected mothers . Depienne et al . [ 5 ] reported on a family in which the transmitting father , affected by moderate mental retardation only , was proven to manifest 47 % PCDH19 deletion - positive ﬁ broblasts . This ﬁ rst con ﬁ rmation of the pathogenic role of PCDH19 mosaicism , leading to phenotypic expression , supports the hypothesis that cellular interference is the main pathogenic mechanism of the disease [ 5 ] . More recently , Dibbens et al . [ 6 ] demonstrated maternal somatic and gonadal mosaicism for PCDH19 missense mutations in two sister pairs . The higher percentage of the normal PCDH19 allele than of the mutant allele may have resulted in fewer PCDH19 - negative neuronal cells than in full heterozygotes , thus explaining the mothers ’ asymptomatic or milder phenotype compared with their daughters [ 6 ] . In our patient , the maternal sequencing pro ﬁ le based on blood DNA did not indicate mosaicism ( Fig 1B ) . However , we did not perform restriction digestion analysis , as previously described [ 6 ] , and somatic mosaicism could not be excluded . Table 1 .

S . Dimova et al . / Pediatric Neurology 46 ( 2012 ) 397 e 400 399 Our family is among the very few reported in which a mother as a heterozygous PCDH19 mutation carrier did not manifest any clinical features [ 6 , 7 , 14 ] . The incomplete , yet very high , penetrance of epilepsy and mental retardation in females was ﬁ rst reported by Ryan et al . [ 14 ] , who detected a single asymptomatic woman in a six - generation pedigree . At that time , the genetic defect under - lyingepilepsy and mental retardation in females was still unknown . Thus the genetic status of this woman remained suspected , but unproven . Moreover , she had three sons , and because males are generally unaffected by the disease , the transmission remained highly probable but nevertheless hypothetical . Epilepsy and mental retardation in females exhibits large phenotypic ( including intrafamilial ) variability , suggesting that other genetic or nongenetic modi ﬁ ers are also involved [ 7 , 11 - 13 ] . One attractive hypothesis states that this phenotypic variability could be attributable to random or skewed X - inactivation . A partly skewed X - inactivation ( such as 60 : 40 , 70 : 30 , or 80 : 20 ) has been speculated to represent situations less severe than the random 50 : 50 X - inactivation with maximal cellular interference [ 7 ] . Recently , Marini et al . [ 11 ] performed an X - inactivation study of PCDH19 mutation - positive patients . However , no correlation was evident between their X - inactivation status and phenotypic expression . Nonetheless , the X - inactivation status in lymphocytes does not re ﬂ ect that of neural tissues . Therefore , a functional mosaicism of neuronal cells as a result of skewed X - inactivation may comprise the main pathogenic mechanism leading to the phenotypic variability in PCDH19 mutations and epilepsy and mental retardation in females . Accordingly , our patient ’ s mother may be asymptomatic because of totally skewed X - inactivation ( > 80 : 20 ) , resulting in a very low rate of PCDH19 mutated cells , below the level needed for clinical manifestations . Other genetic factors may come into play to “ rescue ” the phenotype into mild epilepsy in some patients [ 12 ] . We speculate that because of the complex interaction of genetic , epigenetic , or environmental factors , some PCDH19 mutation carriers could even fully “ escape ” any disease manifestation , as was the case with our patient ’ s mother . We believe our case report expands the mutational spectrum related to PCDH19 - associated epilepsy in females . In light of all previous ﬁ ndings and our rare case of unusual inheritance from an unaffected mother carrying a pathogenic mutation , PCDH19 mutational analysis should be considered in sporadic females with seizures beginning in infancy and early childhood , and in particular in the context of developmental delay , intellectual and behavioral disability , and febrile acute - onset epilepsy [ 7 , 9 , 11 - 13 , 15 ] .
