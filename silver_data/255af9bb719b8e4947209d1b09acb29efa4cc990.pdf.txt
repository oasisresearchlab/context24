We sequenced the exomes of six unrelated individuals with this syndrome and identified heterozygous nonsense and frameshift mutations in NOTCH2 in five of them . All mutations cluster to the last coding exon of the gene , suggesting that the mutant mRNA products escape nonsense - mediated decay and that the resulting truncated NOTCH2 proteins act in a gain - of - function manner . Hajdu - Cheney syndrome ( HCS ; MIM % 102500 ) is a rare skeletal disorder characterized by the association of facial anomalies , radio - logical findings ( acro - osteolysis , general osteoporosis and insufficient ossification of the skull ) and periodontal disease ( premature loss of permanent teeth ) ( Fig . 1 ) 1 . Other features include cleft palate , con - genital heart defects , polycystic kidneys , orthopedic problems and anomalies of the genitalia , intestines and eyes . Although most cases are sporadic , transmission in a few families suggests autosomal domi - nant inheritance ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) 1 . The low number of cases and multiplex families has impaired the identification of mutations underlying HCS by conventional genetic approaches . We sequenced the exomes of six unrelated individuals with Hajdu - Cheney syndrome . Clinical features of these individuals are presented in Table 1 and Supplementary Table 1 . We obtained informed consent from each family member for genetic analyses according to local ethical guidelines from all participating institutions . We performed enrichment by hybrid - izing shotgun fragment libraries to SureSelect Human All Exon Agilent microarrays followed by massively parallel sequencing ( Supplementary Methods ) . On average , we generated 3 . 02 Gb of sequence per sample to achieve ×45 coverage of the mappable , targeted exome ( 38 Mb total ) . We focused our analyses on non - synonymous variants located in coding sequences , anticipating that synonymous variants in coding sequences and variants in 5 ′ untranslated regions ( UTR ) , 3 ′ UTR and intronic sequences were far less likely to be pathogenic ( Supplementary Table 2 ) . Because of the probable dominant nature of the disease , we hypothesized that variants causing HCS should be absent from control populations and thus from all public datasets , including dbSNP129 and the 1000 Genomes Project . We identified 78 genes that were affected by distinct missense variants in three unrelated cases ( Supplementary Tables 2 and 3 ) . However , based on a thorough literature review , none of these genes appeared to be a good candidate . In contrast , only five genes ( ARSD , NOMO3 , NOTCH2 , OR2T35 and CDK18 ) were inactivated by nonsense mutations in two unrelated cases , among which NOTCH2 appeared to be a good functional can - didate ( Supplementary Table 4 ) . By checking unfiltered sequencing data for any missed genetic variants within NOTCH2 , we identified an additional nonsense mutation in a third affected individual . This mutation had previously been overlooked because of low coverage ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . Next , we searched for frameshift mutations specifically in NOTCH2 and identified small insertions and deletions Truncating mutations in the last exon of NOTCH2 cause a rare skeletal disorder with osteoporosis Bertrand Isidor 1 , 17 , Pierre Lindenbaum 1 – 3 , 17 , Olivier Pichon 1 , Stéphane Bézieau 1 , 3 , Christian Dina 2 – 4 , Sébastien Jacquemont 5 , Dominique Martin - Coignard 6 , Christel Thauvin - Robinet 7 , 8 , Martine Le Merrer 9 – 11 , Jean - Louis Mandel 12 – 16 , Albert David 1 , Laurence Faivre 7 , 8 , Valérie Cormier - Daire 9 , 10 , 11 , Richard Redon 1 – 3 & Cédric Le Caignec 1 – 4 1 CHU Nantes , Service de Génétique Médicale , Nantes , France . 2 INSERM , UMR915 , L’Institut du Thorax , Nantes , France . 3 Université de Nantes , Nantes , France . 4 CNRS , ERL3147 , Nantes , France . 5 Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois ( CHUV ) , Service de Génétique Médicale , Lausanne , Switzerland . 6 Unité de Génétique Clinique , Centre Hospitalier du Mans , Le Mans , France . 7 Centre de Génétique , Centre de Référence Maladies Rares ‘Anomalies du développement et syndromes malformatifs de l’interrégion Est’ Hôpital d’Enfants , CHU , Dijon , France . 8 Université de Bourgogne , Dijon , France . 9 INSERM U781 , Paris , France . 10 Département de Génétique , Hôpital Necker - Enfants Malades , Paris , France . 11 Université Paris Descartes , Paris , France . 12 Translational Medicine and Neurogenetics Program , Institut de Génétique et de Biologie , Moléculaire et Cellulaire ( IGBMC ) , Collège de France , Illkirch , France . 13 INSERM U964 , Illkirch , France . 14 CNRS UMR 7104 , Illkirch , France . 15 Université de Strasbourg , Illkirch , France . 16 CHU de Strasbourg , Strasbourg , France . 17 These authors contributed equally to this work .

In the remaining case , we could not detect any mutation in the coding regions of NOTCH2 or in the exon - intron boundaries by exome sequencing . Although the phenotypes of this individual and his affected father were similar to that of carriers of NOTCH2 mutations , we could not find any potentially deleterious mutations in genes of the NOTCH pathway in his exome . Sanger sequencing confirmed the presence of heterozygous NOTCH2 mutations in the five affected individuals ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . We tested inheritance in families 1 and 2 and showed that both mutations had occurred de novo . We confirmed parental origin in all available case - parent trios by microsatellite marker analysis . By capillary sequencing , we found that the NOTCH2 mutations were car - ried by four additional affected relatives in families 4 and 5 , whereas we identified only wild - type alleles in healthy individuals in these families . We found none of the NOTCH2 mutations in 152 ethnically - matched control individuals . These results indicate that mutations in NOTCH2 are the principal cause of HCS . The NOTCH signaling pathway is critical for cell - fate determination 2 . In humans , there are four NOTCH receptors ( NOTCH1 – NOTCH4 ) and at least five NOTCH ligands . NOTCH proteins are single - pass type I membrane proteins with an extracellular domain consisting mainly of multiple epidermal growth factor - like ( EGF ) repeats and an intracellular domain ( NICD ) containing ankyrin repeats , nuclear localization sequences ( NLS ) and a conserved proline - glutamic acid - serine - threonine - rich ( PEST ) domain at the C terminus , which regulates the stability of the NICD . NOTCH signaling is activated through cell - cell contact : ligand binding induces cleavage of NOTCH and translocation of the NICD to the nucleus where it regulates gene expression in association with transcriptional cofactors . The clustering of the five observed trun - cating mutations in a 236 - amino - acid interval ( ~ 9 . 5 % of the NOTCH2 coding sequence ) is striking . The interruption of the NOTCH2 coding sequence caused by the mutations preserves the ankyrin - repeat domain and the last NLS but removes the PEST domain , which is implicated in the regulation of ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of proteins carrying such domains 2 ( Fig . 1 and Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . In addition , as these mutations create a premature stop codon located in the last exon of NOTCH2 , they likely escape nonsense - mediated mRNA decay 3 . The mutant mRNA is expected to be stable and the resulting truncated protein to be functional but with a constitutively active intracellular domain . Components of the NOTCH signaling pathway have been impli - cated in common human pathologies , including cancer , stroke and Alzheimer’s disease . Loss of NOTCH signaling causes monogenic disorders affecting skeletal tissue , such as spondylocostal dysostosis ( MIM # 277300 ) and Alagille syndrome ( MIM # 118450 ) . Most cases of Alagille syndrome are caused by mutations leading to haploinsuf - ficiency of the NOTCH ligand JAG1 ( ref . 4 ) . In addition , one mis - sense and one splice mutation in NOTCH2 have been identified in two families with Alagille syndrome with no JAG1 mutations 5 . Notably , the splice mutation removes exon 33 and results in a premature stop codon in exon 34 ; thus , the aberrant transcripts escape nonsense - mediated mRNA decay . However , in contrast to the NOTCH2 mutations in HCS , the mutation removes three of seven ankyrin repeats and the last NLS , in addition to the PEST domain , and likely results in a loss - of - function or dominant - negative mutation . This difference between the effects of NOTCH2 mutations in HCS and Alagille syndromes is a rare example in table 1 clinical features of individuals with Hajdu - cheney syndrome carrying NOTCH2 mutations Individual ID F1 - II - 1 F2 - II - 1 F3 - II - 1 F4 - I - 1 F4 - II - 1 F4 - II - 5 F4 - III - 1 F5 - II - 2 F5 - III - 1 Gender M F M M M F M F F Age ( yrs ) at time of last report 19 25 57 54 35 36 16 31 3 craniofacial features Facial dysmorphology a + + + + + + + + + Microretrognathism / Pierre - Robin sequence − + + − + − + + − Periodontal disease + − + + + + + + + cognitive and sensory function Developmental delay − − − − − − − − − Neurologic symptoms + + + − + − + − − Hearing deficit + + + + + + + + + General physical features Short stature + + + − − − − − − Congenital heart defect PDA , VSD PDA − − − − − − − Polycystic kidneys − + + − − − − − − Joint hyperlaxity + + + − − − − + + radiographic abnormalities Acro - osteloysis + + + + + + + + − Osteoporosis + + + + + − + + − Wormian bones + + + + + + + + + Bowing of the fibula − − − − − − − + − Vertebral compression / fracture − − + + + − − − − Platybasia / basilar impression + − + + + − + − − additional features − Iris coloboma Umbilical hernia − Small right kidney , inguinal hernia − Hypospadias − − NOTCH2 mutations identified cDNA ( NM _ 024408 . 2 ) c . 6427 _ 6428insT c . 6853C > T c . 6449 _ 6450delCT c . 7119T > G c . 7119T > G c . 7119T > G c . 7119T > G c . 6949C > T c . 6949C > T Protein ( NP _ 077719 . 2 ) p .

A ll r i gh t s r ese r ve d . 308 VOLUME 43 | NUMBER 4 | APRIL 2011 Nature GeNetics which notably different phenotypes caused by allelic truncating muta - tions depend on their exact location . Interestingly , frameshift mutations affecting the PEST domain of NOTCH1 contribute to human T - cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia through a gain - of - function mechanism 6 , highlighting the critical role of the PEST domain . Similarly , activat - ing somatic mutations in NOTCH2 have recently been observed in a minority of large B - cell lymphomas 7 . In mouse , homozygosity for a targeted Notch2 hypomorphic allele ( which produces two different in - frame transcripts deleted for EGF repeats ) results in perinatal lethality with prominent defects in the kidney and developmental anomalies affecting the heart and eye but with no reported skeletal anomalies , whereas heterozygous mice appeared normal and were fertile 8 . However , conditional knockout of both Notch1 and Notch2 in early limb mesenchyme resulted in skeletal anomalies and a complex age - related bone phenotype with increased bone mass in young mice and osteopenia in aged mice 9 . In vitro and in vivo studies support a role for the Notch pathway in osteoblastogenesis , osteoclastogenesis and bone formation 9 – 12 . However , the direction ( inhibitory or stimulatory ) of the effect of Notch signaling on osteoblastogenesis is controversial . Loss of Notch signaling in osteoblasts may lead to osteoporosis through activation of osteoclastogenesis 10 , 11 . In contrast , suppression of Notch signal - ing by a selective γ - secretase inhibitor or Notch2 short hairpin RNA suppresses RANKL - induced osteoclastogenesis , whereas ectopic expression of intracellular Notch2 promotes osteoclastogenesis 12 . Interestingly , a genome - wide association study identified JAG1 as a candidate gene for bone mineral density regulation and a poten - tial risk factor for fracture 13 . These findings are concordant with the increased risk for pathologic fractures observed in individuals with Alagille syndrome 14 . Further investigations are needed to understand the mechanisms by which acro - osteolysis and osteoporosis—two car - dinal features of HCS—may be caused by NOTCH2 dysfunction . The five nonsense or frameshift mutations causing HCS that we found were invariably located within the last coding exon of NOTCH2 , distal to the ankyrin repeats and NLS necessary for the transcrip - tional activity of NOTCH2 intracellular domain , and delete the PEST domain . We propose that all mutations result in increased NOTCH2 signaling . In contrast , more proximal mutations may result in a loss - of - function ( or dominant - negative ) effect as suggested by the two NOTCH2 mutations previously reported in Alagille syndrome 5 . The rarity of HCS may thus be explained by the very small target size for mutations leading to this particular phenotype . This mutational mech - anism also suggests that decreasing NOTCH2 signaling using selective γ - secretase inhibitors may have therapeutic benefit in this severe and progressive disease 15 . Finally , our findings establish an important role for NOTCH2 signaling in bone homeostasis that may lead to better understanding of the mechanisms contributing to osteoporosis . URLs .
