TNF α induces the expression of intercellular cell adhesion molecule - 1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule - 1 ( VCAM - 1 ) . VCAM - 1 was originally identiﬁed as a cell adhesion molecule that helps regulate inﬂammation - associated vascular adhesion and the transendothelial migration of leukocytes , such as macrophages and T cells . Recent evidence suggests that VCAM - 1 is closely associated with the progression of various immunological disorders , including rheumatoid arthritis , asthma , transplant rejection , and cancer . This review covers the role and relevance of VCAM - 1 in inﬂammation , and also highlights the emerging potential of VCAM - 1 as a novel therapeutic target in immunological disorders and cancer . Keywords : antibody ; cancer ; inflammation ; immunological disorder ; therapeutic target ; tumor necrosis factor α ; vascular cell adhesion molecule - 1 1 . Introduction Tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF α ) is a member of the TNF ligand superfamily , which are primarily produced by immune cells , including macrophages , T lymphocytes , and natural killer cells [ 1 ] . TNF α helps regulate immunologic , hematopoietic , and pro - inﬂammatory activities [ 2 , 3 ] . In 1975 , TNF α was ﬁrst isolated by Carswell et al . from the sera of mice infected with Bacillus Calmette - Gu é rin and was identiﬁed as a TNF in Meth A sarcoma cells and other transplanted tumors [ 4 ] . The matrix metalloprotease TNF α - converting enzyme processes TNF α into 157 amino acid residues ( 17 kDa ) via proteolytic cleavage between residues alanine 76 and valine 77 [ 5 ] . This soluble form of TNF α speciﬁcally binds to TNF receptor 1 ( TNFR1 ) , a type I transmembrane protein , which is expressed in almost all cells as pre - assembled trimers [ 5 – 7 ] . Structurally , the extracellular components of TNFR1 comprise three well - ordered cysteine - rich domains ( CRD1 , CRD2 , and CRD3 ) , and a less conserved fourth CRD [ 8 , 9 ] . Among the CRDs , CRD2 , and CRD3 are mainly involved in TNF α binding [ 10 ] . The intracellular domain of TNFR1 contains a death domain ( DD ) [ 10 ] . The binding of TNF α to TNFR leads to receptor homotrimerization and the recruitment of adaptor proteins to the intracellular domain , resulting in inﬂammation , apoptosis , reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) generation , cell proliferation , and cell survival [ 11 , 12 ] . These pleiotropic bioactivities of TNF α are associated with diseases , including diabetes , heart failure , atherosclerosis , cancer , sepsis , and autoimmune diseases [ 1 , 13 – 17 ] . Upon binding to TNF α , TNFR1 induces several intracellular signaling pathways , including nuclear factor κ B ( NF - κ B ) and mitogen - activated kinase ( MAPK ) pathways [ 11 , 12 ] . The DD of the intracellular tail of TNFR1 rapidly recruits TNFR1 - associated death domain protein ( TRADD ) and complexes with TNF receptor - associated factor 2 ( TRAF2 ) , receptor - interacting protein 1 ( RIP1 ) , and cellular inhibitor of apoptosis proteins ( cIAP1 / 2 ) [ 12 , 18 ] . Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2018 , 19 , 1057 ; doi : 10 . 3390 / ijms19041057 www . mdpi . com / journal / ijms Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2018 , 19 , 1057 2 of 16 Subsequently , these complexes stimulate the transforming growth factor - β - activated kinase 1 ( TAK1 ) signaling complex , which is composed of TAK1 , TAK1 binding proteins 2 and 3 ( TAB2 and TAB3 ) , and the inhibitor of κ B ( I κ B ) kinase ( IKK ) signaling complex , which includes the NF - κ B essential modulator ( NEMO ) and IKK subunits α and β , through the scaffolding ubiquitin network [ 12 , 18 ] . The TAK1 signaling pathway in turn triggers MAPK signaling cascades , leading to c - jun N - terminal kinase ( JNK ) , P38 , and AP1 activation , whereas the IKK signaling complex activates the NF - κ B pathway via the phosphorylation of I κ B α [ 12 , 18 ] . Subsequently , TNFR1 signaling induces the expression of NF - κ B and AP1 target genes , including E - selectin , intracellular adhesion molecule - 1 ( ICAM - 1 ) , and vascular cell adhesion molecule - 1 ( VCAM - 1 ) [ 11 , 12 , 18 , 19 ] . VCAM - 1 ( CD106 ) is a 90 - kDa glycoprotein that is inducible and predominantly expressed in endothelial cells . In 1989 , VCAM - 1 was ﬁrst identiﬁed as an endothelial cell surface glycoprotein [ 20 , 21 ] . VCAM - 1 expression is activated by pro - inﬂammatory cytokines , including TNF α , and also by ROS , oxidized low density lipoprotein , high glucose concentration , toll - like receptor agonists , and shear stress [ 22 ] . Under high levels of inﬂammation and chronic conditions in some diseases , VCAM - 1 also is expressed on the surface of other cells , including tissue macrophages , dendritic cells , bone marrow ﬁbroblasts , myoblasts , oocytes , Kupffer cells , Sertoli cells , and cancer cells [ 23 , 24 ] . Structurally , human VCAM - 1 contains an extracellular domain with six or seven immunoglobulin ( Ig ) - like domains , a transmembrane domain , and a cytoplasmic domain , whereas the mouse VCAM - 1 has a three or seven Ig - like domain form [ 22 , 25 ] . The Ig - like domains of the extracellular domain contain both the disulﬁde - linked loops and the N - glycosylation site that binds to galectin - 3 on eosinophil [ 22 , 25 , 26 ] . In addition to galectin - 3 , Ig - like domain 1 and / or 4 of VCAM - 1 is involved in ligand binding , including α 4 β 1 integrin and α 4 β 7 integrin [ 22 , 25 ] . α 4 β 1 integrin plays a major role in the VCAM - 1 – mediated rolling and ﬁrm adhesion of leukocytes to the endothelium , as well as leukocyte transmigration [ 27 , 28 ] . During inﬂammatory responses , ligands binding to VCAM - 1 on the surface of activated endothelial cells ﬁrst initiate the activation of calcium ﬂuxes and Rac1 [ 22 , 29 ] . In turn , the calcium ﬂuxes and Rac1 induce the downstream activation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate ( NADPH ) oxidase 2 , leading to ROS generation [ 29 ] . NADPH oxidase produces superoxide from oxygen using the cofactor NADPH , followed by dismutation to hydrogen peroxide ( H 2 O 2 ) . This intracellular H 2 O 2 markedly affects signal transduction and leads to the activation of matrix metalloproteinases and protein kinase C α ( PKC α ) [ 30 , 31 ] . Activated PKC α in turn increases the serine phosphorylation of the protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B ( PTP1B ) on the endoplasmic reticulum , which activates PTP1B . PTP1B activation is required for VCAM - 1 – dependent leukocyte transendothelial migration [ 31 , 32 ] . VCAM - 1 also stimulates the formation of actin stress ﬁbers via the Rac1 - p21 - activated protein kinase - myosin light chain signaling pathway [ 31 ] . Finally , this signal transduction pathway leads to gap formation or junctional weakening of endothelial cell – cell interaction that facilitates leukocyte transendothelial migration under inﬂammation conditions [ 22 , 31 ] ( Figure 1 ) . Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2018 , 19 , 1057 3 of 16 Figure 1 . Mechanism of vascular cell adhesion molecule - 1 ( VCAM - 1 ) – mediated leukocyte adhesion and transendothelial migration across endothelial cells . In inﬂammation , tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF α , which is mainly secreted from leukocytes , upregulates VCAM - 1 expression on the surface of endothelial cells . VCAM - 1 on activated endothelial cells directly interacts with α 4 β 1 integrin on leukocytes . In turn , this interaction activates VCAM - 1 downstream signaling molecules , including Ca 2 + , Rac1 , nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase 2 ( NOX2 ) , reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) , metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) , protein kinase Ca ( PKC α ) , and protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B ( PTP1B ) . Eventually , these signals relax the afﬁnity of junction adhesion molecules within endothelial cell inunctions , allowing leukocytes to migrate through the junction . 2 . Role of VCAM - 1 in Inﬂammation Inﬂammation is a protective biological response that recruits immune cells , blood vessels , and molecular mediators to eliminate harmful stimuli , including bacteria , viruses , or damaged cells . In inﬂammation , leukocyte trafﬁcking is regulated by the complicated and coordinated actions of many molecular mediators , including chemokines , selectins , and cell adhesion molecules [ 33 , 34 ] . Generally , inﬂammation is initiated by the release of TNF α from immune cells , such as macrophages , T lymphocytes , and natural killer cells [ 35 ] . In turn , TNF α triggers a series of various cell adhesion molecules , such as selectins , ICAM - 1 , and VCAM - 1 , to recruit a subset of leukocytes at inﬂamed sites through leukocyte adhesion [ 19 ] . Among these adhesion molecules , VCAM - 1 is a major regulator of leukocyte adhesion and transendothelial migration through interaction with α 4 β 1 integrin . α 4 β 1 integrin expressed on leukocytes adheres to VCAM - 1 on the surface of endothelial cells , and activates signaling pathways within the activated endothelial cells that allow the transendothelial migration of leukocytes [ 28 ] . VCAM - 1 and α 4 β 1 integrin play a central role in leukocyte recruitment during inﬂammation . In 1989 , Osborn et al . reported that Jurkat T cells and Ramos cells had more adhesion to TNF α - treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) and VCAM - 1 – transfected COS - 7 cells than untreated HUVECs and control vector - transfected COS - 7 cells , respectively [ 21 ] . This ﬁnding suggested that VCAM - 1 is critical for the adhesion of lymphocytes to human endothelial cells [ 21 ] . Additionally , in follicular dendritic cells , α 4 β 1 integrin was identiﬁed as a VCAM - 1 ligand that is required for the ﬁrm adhesion of B cells to lymphoid germinal centers [ 36 ] . In other studies , α 4 β 1 Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2018 , 19 , 1057 4 of 16 integrin - transfected K562 erythroleukemia cells exhibited tethering and rolling in a VCAM - 1 - coated ﬂow chamber with TNF α - stimulated HUVEC monolayers , and the siRNA - mediated knockdown of VCAM - 1 in subcutaneous hemangioma endothelial cells ( sEnd1 ) reduced the adhesion of Jurkat T cells to monolayers of sEnd1 , demonstrating the importance of the interaction between α 4 β 1 integrin and VCAM - 1 in inﬂammation [ 27 , 37 ] . Further , in dextran sulfate sodium - induced colitis mouse models , the neutralization of VCAM - 1 by anti - VCAM - 1 antibody ( MK1 . 91 ) disabled leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium and signiﬁcantly attenuated colitis [ 38 ] . In mouse models of ovalbumin ( OVA ) - induced pulmonary inﬂammation , the recruitment of mast cell precursors was signiﬁcantly lower in VCAM - 1 knockout mice than in wild - type mice [ 39 ] . In the same model , the administration of an anti - VCAM - 1 antibody ( 429 ) also had reduced the recruitment of mast cell precursors to the inﬂamed lung [ 39 ] . Furthermore , the anti - VCAM - 1 antibody attenuated macrophage , neutrophil , and eosinophil recruitment in an OVA - induced murine allergic asthma model [ 40 ] . To understand the role of VCAM - 1 in inﬂammation , it is important to understand the speciﬁc roles of each VCAM - 1 domain . The extracellular domain of VCAM - 1 contains seven Ig - like domains [ 22 ] . Ig - like domain pairs of 1 and 4 , 2 and 5 , and 3 and 6 are highly homologous with each other [ 22 ] . Domain 1 ( and / or 4 ) of VCAM - 1 is involved in the direct binding of α 4 β 1 integrin , resulting in leukocyte adhesion [ 22 ] . Osborn et al . showed that treatment with anti - VCAM - 1 domains 1 or 4 - blocking antibodies ( 4B9 and ED11 ) speciﬁcally reduced the interaction of α 4 β 1 integrin - expressing Ramos cells with TNF α - stimulated HUVECs and VCAM - 1 - overexpressing CV - 1 ( simian ) in Origin , and carrying the SV40 genetic material ( COS ) cells in vitro [ 41 ] . Additionally , Q38S , D40A , and L43NAD mutation at domain 1 or D328A and L331A mutation at domain 4 signiﬁcantly inhibited the binding of Ramos cells to VCAM - 1 - overexpressing COS cells [ 42 ] . In addition to the functions of Ig - like domains 1 and 4 , we recently developed a rabbit / human chimeric monoclonal antibody speciﬁc to the Ig - like domain 6 of VCAM - 1 ( anti - VCAM - 1 - D6 chimeric mAb ) [ 43 ] . Using this antibody , we demonstrated that Ig - like domain 6 is important for leukocyte transmigration , but not for leukocyte adhesion [ 43 ] . The VCAM - 1 - D6 antibody speciﬁcally blocked the transmigration of U937 human promonocytic leukocyte cells through TNF α - stimulated HUVECs , but did not affect the adhesion of U937 cells to TNF α - stimulated HUVECs [ 43 ] . Together , these data suggest that the Ig - like domains 1 and 4 of VCAM - 1 play a crucial role in the binding of the α 4 β 1 ligand for leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium , whereas Ig - like domain 6 enables leukocyte transmigration in inﬂammation . 3 . Role of VCAM - 1 in Immunological Disorders 3 . 1 . Rheumatoid Arthritis ( RA ) Rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) is a systemic and chronic autoimmune disease that is characterized by symmetric polyarticular joint disorders that primarily affect the small joints [ 44 , 45 ] . Although various factors are related to the pathogenesis of RA , TNF α predominantly mediates inﬂammation , ultimately leading to joint deformation , destruction , and disability [ 46 , 47 ] . In RA , leukocytes travel to the joint and produce cytokines including TNF α . Then , these proteins stimulate the cells to attack healthy tissues , leading to inﬂammation and the progressive damage of cartilage , bone , and other joint - related tissues [ 44 , 45 , 47 ] . To date , there are three TNF α inhibitors that have been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration [ 48 – 50 ] . Inﬂiximab , a chimeric monoclonal antibody , neutralizes soluble and transmembrane TNF α , and prevents TNF α from binding to its receptor [ 48 ] . Etanercept , a fusion protein with the extracellular portion of TNF α receptor and the Fc region of human IgG1 antibody , targets soluble TNF α [ 49 ] . Adalimumab , a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting TNF α , also neutralizes both soluble and transmembrane TNF α [ 50 ] . VCAM - 1 expression is closely associated with RA . Wang et al . showed that serum VCAM - 1 levels were much higher in patients with RA than in controls , and that the prolonged use of aspirin , a non - steroid anti - inﬂammatory drug , decreased serum levels of rheumatoid factor and VCAM - 1 , suggesting that serum levels of VCAM - 1 may be related to the disease condition [ 51 ] . Klimiuk et al . also Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2018 , 19 , 1057 5 of 16 demonstrated high levels of serum VCAM - 1 in RA patients with follicular synovitis [ 52 ] . Smith et al . investigated the effect of disease - modifying anti - rheumatic drugs ( DMARDs ) such as methotrexate and intramuscular gold on RA patients [ 53 ] . They observed dramatically lower VCAM - 1 levels in the DMARDs - treated group [ 53 ] . Oberoi et al . also showed that adalimumab , a leading RA therapeutic antibody , suppresses the upregulation of VCAM - 1 mRNA and protein expression in HUVECs activated by TNF α , further suggesting the close relationship between VCAM - 1 and RA [ 54 ] . The interaction between VCAM - 1 and α 4 β 1 integrin seems to be critical for RA . Carter et al . investigated the role of VCAM - 1 in an autoimmune mouse model of RA by treating mice with collagen - induced arthritis ( CIA ) with a neutralizing monoclonal antibody ( M / K - 2 . 7 ) [ 55 ] . They found that the antibody signiﬁcantly reduced the overall clinical severity of the disease in comparison with a control antibody [ 55 ] . Using histological analyses , they also observed fewer arthritic joints in the paws of M / K - 2 . 7 – treated mice [ 55 ] . Morales - Ducret et al . also reported the inhibition of binding between Jurkat cells and resting ﬁbroblast - like synoviocytes ( FLS ) monolayers that were exposed to an antibody to α 4 β 1 integrin ( VLA - 4 ) , a CS - 1 peptide from an alternatively spliced ﬁbronectin ( which is another VLA - 4 ligand ) , and , to a lesser extent , an anti - VCAM - 1 antibody [ 56 ] . In addition , B lymphocytes accumulated in the inﬂamed joints of patients with RA and produced high amounts of ( auto ) antibodies [ 56 ] . Reparon - Schuijt et al . showed that synovial ﬂuid B cells undergo spontaneous cell death by apoptosis and are rescued by interactions with FLS [ 57 ] . Further , they demonstrated that an anti - VCAM - 1 blocking antibody ( 1 . G11B1 ) reduced the survival of synovial ﬂuid B cells by inhibiting their interaction with FLS , further supporting the close relationship of α 4 β 1 integrin and VCAM - 1 in RA [ 57 ] . Furthermore , Shimada et al . demonstrated that interleukin - 4 ( IL - 4 ) stimulated the expression of VCAM - 1 , but not ICAM - 1 , on synovial cells , and the IL - 4 - stimulated synovial cells had increased adhesion to T cells , which is mediated by the binding of α 4 β 1 integrin to VCAM - 1 [ 58 ] . They also showed that the adhesion of T cells to synovial cells was inhibited by a murine anti - VCAM - 1 monoclonal antibody ( BBA6 ) or anti - α 4 β 1 integrin ( HP2 / 1 ) , implying that the interaction between VCAM - 1 and α 4 β 1 integrin may play an important role in RA synovium [ 58 ] . Silverman et al . also showed the accumulation of endothelial progenitor cell in synovium in RA using the CIA mouse model , which suggests that the interaction of VCAM - 1 with α 4 β 1 integrin mediates the recruitment of endothelial progenitor cells to promote neovascularization in RA synovial cells [ 59 ] . 3 . 2 . Asthma Asthma is a chronic inﬂammatory disorder of the airways that is associated with bronchial hyperreactivity , reversible airﬂow obstruction , and bronchospasm [ 60 – 64 ] . In the asthmatic lung , IL - 4 promotes VCAM - 1 expression , leading to the VCAM - 1 - mediated adhesion of eosinophils to activated endothelium [ 65 – 68 ] . In turn , the adhesion of blood eosinophils to VCAM - 1 further induces the transmigration of eosinophils across activated endothelial cells , resulting in respiratory burst and the enhanced release of granule proteins in inﬂamed tissues [ 69 – 71 ] . Several studies have shown that VCAM - 1 expression is critical for eosinophil inﬁltration in asthma [ 72 – 74 ] . Ohkawara et al . reported that endothelial VCAM - 1 expression in bronchial mucosa from patients with asthma correlates with eosinophil migration into the airways [ 72 ] . Fukuda et al . showed the increased expression of VCAM - 1 in bronchial mucosa and bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) ﬂuid from patients with allergy - induced asthma [ 73 ] . In the same paper , in vitro studies revealed that IL - 4 - induced VCAM - 1 expression stimulates the transendothelial migration of eosinophils across airway endothelial cells [ 73 ] . Furthermore , they also demonstrated that VCAM - 1 , but not E - selectin or ICAM - 1 , is signiﬁcantly increased in IL - 4 - positive asthma patients , compared with IL - 4 - negative asthma patients [ 73 ] . Hakansson et al . further reported that patients with allergy - induced asthma have higher levels of blood eosinophil inﬁltrates than healthy individuals [ 74 ] . Adhesion assays with eosinophil reveal that IL - 4 increases VCAM - 1 expression in airway endothelial cells and results in the increased adhesion of eosinophils to VCAM - 1 on the cells , emphasizing that the adhesion of eosinophil with VCAM - 1 may play a central role in the pathogenesis of asthma . Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2018 , 19 , 1057 6 of 16 Several reports have suggested the importance of the interactions between VCAM - 1 and α 4 β 1 integrin in asthma [ 66 , 75 – 77 ] . Nakajima et al . demonstrated that blocking VCAM - 1 via murine anti - VCAM - 1 antibody ( M / K - 1 ) decreased the eosinophil inﬁltration in OVA - induced asthma mouse models [ 66 ] . Pretolani et al . demonstrated that aerosol OVA inhalation in guinea pigs increased their bronchial reactivity , which is accompanied by distinct eosinophil inﬁltration in the bronchopulmonary tissue and accumulation in the BAL ﬂuid [ 75 ] . Under these conditions , treatment with an anti - α 4 β 1 integrin monoclonal antibody ( HP1 / 2 ) inhibited antigen - induced bronchial hyperreactivity and inhibited eosinophil inﬁltration and accumulation in the bronchial tubes [ 75 ] . Furthermore , Milne and Piper also observed the higher levels of eosinophils in BAL ﬂuid in OVA mice than in controls , supporting the important role of α 4 β 1 integrin and VCAM - 1 in the recruitment of eosinophils to the inﬂamed lung during bronchial hyperresponsiveness [ 76 ] . Chin et al . further showed the role of the α 4 β 1 integrin and VCAM - 1 on leukocyte trafﬁcking in the airways of mice with OVA - induced asthma treated with anti - α 4 integrin antibodies ( PS / 2 , Rl - 2 ) and anti - VCAM - 1 monoclonal MoAb ( M / K - 2 . 7 ) [ 77 ] . They showed that all three antibodies signiﬁcantly inhibited the recruitment of eosinophils and lymphocytes into BAL ﬂuid and decreased inﬂammation in lung tissue , suggesting that α 4 integrin and VCAM - 1 may have important roles in the recruitment of T cells and eosinophils in OVA - induced airway inﬂammation [ 77 ] . Recently , Lee et al . developed a novel human anti - VCAM - 1 monoclonal antibody ( HD101 ) that binds strongly to Ig - like domains 1 and 2 of human and mouse VCAM - 1 [ 40 ] . They conﬁrmed that the antibody can effectively ameliorate eosinophilic inﬂammation and airway hyperresponsiveness in the OVA mouse model [ 40 ] . Further , they also showed that the antibody inhibits the adhesion of U937 , EoL - 1 , and CD4 + T cells to human VCAM - 1 [ 40 ] . In addition , the adhesion of U937 and EoL - 1 to TNF α - activated HUVECs also was blocked effectively by the antibody in a concentration - dependent manner [ 40 ] . Together , these results suggest that antibodies targeting VCAM - 1 may be an effective therapeutic approach to alleviate asthma . 3 . 3 . Transplant Rejection Owing to mismatched organ donors and recipients , organs can be rejected by the innate and adaptive immune system of the recipient in allotransplantation or xenotransplantation [ 78 , 79 ] . Transplant rejection is initiated by the infiltration of leukocytes toward inflamed sites . Lymphocytes and monocytes are central players in this response , and ultimately cause graft damage [ 80 , 81 ] . Transplant rejection is a complex interplay between the recipient’s leukocytes and the donor’s endothelium . In organ transplantation , the endothelium of the grafted organs is the ﬁrst barrier between self and non - self that is encountered by host leukocytes [ 82 ] . Cell adhesion molecules , particularly VCAM - 1 , expressed on endothelium are closely related to leukocyte transmigration and recruitment toward inﬂammation sites . Over the past several decades , many studies of transplant rejection have demonstrated the upregulation of VCAM - 1 expression on the endothelium of grafted organs , including the liver , kidneys , lungs , and heart . For example , in frozen sections of human liver allografts , VCAM - 1 expression is signiﬁcantly increased in the vascular and sinusoidal endothelium of the acutely rejected grafts [ 83 ] . Ultrastructural immunogold localization results show that VCAM - 1 expression also is upregulated on the peritubular capillary endothelium in renal allograft rejection and is strongly focally expressed on the basolateral surface of tubules [ 84 ] . Furthermore , VCAM - 1 mRNA levels progressively increase with rejection times in pulmonary endoarterial biopsy samples of canine lung allograft models [ 85 ] . Additionally , according to several studies , endomyocardial biopsies of acutely rejected human cardiac allografts showed increased VCAM - 1 expression , which correlates with the degree of CD3 + T cell inﬁltrates and rejection [ 86 – 88 ] . Taken together , these data suggest that VCAM - 1 expression may play an important role in transplant rejection , and could be a useful biomarker for transplant rejection . Several reports show that the modulation of the interaction between VCAM - 1 and α 4 β 1 integrin may alleviate transplant rejection . In a skin allograft C3H / HEJ murine model , an anti - mouse VCAM - 1 antibody ( MK1 . 9 ) , either alone or in combination with an anti - mouse VLA - 4 antibody ( PS / 2 ) significantly Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2018 , 19 , 1057 7 of 16 improved the graft survival of C3H / HEJ mice [ 89 ] . Stegall et al . also reported that in an islet allograft CBA murine model , an anti - mouse VCAM - 1 antibody ( MK2 . 7 ) prolonged islet allograft survival by more than 100 days with an islet graft survival rate of 75 % [ 90 ] . Furthermore , the treatment of cardiac allograft C57BL / 6 mice with an anti - mouse VCAM - 1 antibody ( MK2 . 7 ) alleviated rejection and prolonged graft survival by approximately five days [ 87 ] . In addition , MK2 . 7 antibodies specifically bind to the Ig - like domains 1 and 4 of VCAM - 1 [ 91 ] . Recently , we demonstrated that the anti - VCAM - 1 - D6 chimeric monoclonal antibody we developed can improve islet allograft survival [ 43 ] . In detail , treatment with the antibody prolonged graft survival for more than 110 days in an islet allograft C57BL / 6 murine model [ 43 ] . Furthermore , we found that the antibody significantly blocks the migration of CD4 + T cells and macrophages toward the grafted islets [ 43 ] . Intriguingly , our in vitro results show that , in contrast with other antibody blockades targeting the interaction between VCAM - 1 and α 4 β 1 integrin , our antibody uniquely inhibits the transendothelial migration of leukocytes without affecting leukocyte adhesion [ 43 ] . Together , these results suggest that the Ig - like domain 6 of VCAM - 1 plays an important role in leukocyte transmigration in transplant rejection . 4 . Role of VCAM - 1 in Cancer 4 . 1 . VCAM - 1 in Angiogenesis Recently , increasing amounts of evidence have shown that VCAM - 1 is closely associated with tumor angiogenesis and metastasis . In this section , we will highlight the speciﬁc roles of VCAM - 1 on tumor angiogenesis and metastasis . Angiogenesis is a physiological process in which new blood vessels form from pre - existing blood vessels . It is ﬁnely regulated by many pro - angiogenic factors , including vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , epidermal growth factor , angiopoietin , and hepatocyte growth factor , and anti - angiogenic factors containing thrombospondin , endostatin , and angiostatin [ 92 – 97 ] . Tumor angiogenesis is a hallmark of cancer [ 98 , 99 ] , and VEGF is a central player for regulating tumor angiogenesis [ 100 ] . Currently , bevacizumab , a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting VEGF , is one of the best treatments for patients with various cancers , including breast , brain , lung , ovarian , and renal cancers [ 101 ] . However , bevacizumab also regulates many other cellular functions , such as the activation of the coagulation cascade , kidney function , blood pressure , vascular homeostasis , bone marrow function , and thyroid function [ 102 ] . Thus , long - term bevacizumab use can lead to various adverse effects , such as hypertension , proteinuria , bleeding , and gastrointestinal perforation [ 103 , 104 ] . Furthermore , long - term bevacizumab use also provokes drug resistance in cancer therapy [ 105 , 106 ] . In this regard , new therapeutic targets in angiogenesis need to be identiﬁed . Many studies have shown the relevance of VCAM - 1 in angiogenesis . Yong - Bin et al . reported that VCAM - 1 - positive tissue has a higher microvessel density than VCAM - 1 - negative tissue in gastric cancer [ 107 ] . Byrne et al . reported that serum VCAM - 1 levels correlate with the microvessel density of breast cancer , suggesting that serum VCAM - 1 may be a surrogate marker of angiogenesis in breast cancer [ 108 ] . Other studies show that VEGF can upregulate the expression of VCAM - 1 expression on endothelial cells [ 109 , 110 ] . Much attention has been paid to the interaction between VCAM - 1 and α 4 β 1 integrin in angiogenesis . For example , Garmy - Susini et al . ﬁrst observed that VCAM - 1 and α 4 β 1 integrin were individually expressed on vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells in the developing vessels of breast cancer , and found that the administration of an anti - murine VCAM - 1 antibody ( M / K - 2 ) speciﬁcally reduced microvessel formation in Matrigel plug mouse models [ 111 ] . Furthermore , another report shows that in vitro exposure to anti - VCAM - 1 antibody blocked IL - 4 – and IL - 13 – induced tube formation , and angiogenesis induced in vivo by IL - 4 and IL - 13 was inhibited by an antibody against α 4 integrin [ 112 ] . Recently , we identiﬁed the Ig - like domain 6 of VCAM - 1 ( VCAM - 1 - D6 ) as a potential angiogenic target [ 113 ] . Using siRNA - mediated VCAM - 1 knockdown , we found that VCAM - 1 downregulation reduces TNF α - induced HUVEC migration and tube formation [ 113 ] . Competition assay results showed Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2018 , 19 , 1057 8 of 16 that TNF α - induced HUVEC tube formation is speciﬁcally inhibited by VCAM - 1 - D6 fused with Fc but not by Fc alone , indicating that VCAM - 1 - D6 is a key domain in TNF α - induced angiogenesis [ 113 ] . Furthermore , we found that VCAM - 1 overexpression in HEK293 cells increases VCAM - 1 – mediated cell – cell contacts , and that these interactions are inhibited by a rabbit / human chimeric monoclonal antibody that is speciﬁc to the VCAM - 1 - D6 that we developed [ 113 ] . Lastly , we demonstrated that the antibody can speciﬁcally inhibit not only TNF α - induced HUVEC migration and tube formation , but also TNF α - induced vessel sprouting from rat aorta without severe endothelial cell toxicity [ 113 ] . These data suggest that VCAM - 1 may be a key target for modulating tumor angiogenesis . 4 . 2 . VCAM - 1 in Metastasis Tumor metastasis is a complex process that involves the invasion and intravasation of tumor cells from primary sites to enter circulation via the lymph or blood system , extravasation of these circulating tumor cells into distant tissues , and tumor formation in distant organs . Despite the remarkable development of cancer therapeutics , metastasis is closely associated with high mortality rates in cancer patients [ 114 , 115 ] . VCAM - 1 expression seems to be closely implicated in the metastasis of various cancer cells . For example , through a comparative gene proﬁle analysis of parental MDA - MB - 231 breast cancer cells and in vivo isolates exhibiting lung metastatic activity , Minn et al . found that VCAM - 1 expression is upregulated in metastatic breast cancer cells to the lungs [ 116 ] . Liu et al . showed that VCAM - 1 expression correlated with the clinicopathological grade of gliomas [ 117 ] . Furthermore , mesothelium VCAM - 1 expression was negatively associated with progression - free and overall survival in patients with epithelium ovarian cancers [ 118 ] . VCAM - 1 expression also is upregulated in lung cancers [ 119 ] . In addition , VCAM - 1 is overexpressed in colorectal cancer , and is associated with lymph node metastasis , clinical stage , and tumor progression in patients with colorectal cancer [ 120 ] . Several VCAM - 1 modulators further show the relationship of VCAM - 1 in tumor metastasis . The in vitro transfection of microRNA - 181a - 5p , a tumor suppressor , downregulates VCAM - 1 expression and impedes IL - 17 - induced proliferation and the migration of H226 and H460 non - small cell lung cancer cells [ 121 ] . The shRNA - mediated knockdown of VCAM - 1 in MDA231 breast cancer cells reduced adhesion with U937 promonocytic leukocyte cells , and also inhibited lung metastasis [ 122 ] . The pretreatment of melanoma cells with an antibody speciﬁc to α 4 β 1 integrin completely inhibited the IL - 1 - induced augmentation of lung colonies , suggesting the importance of VCAM - 1 – α 4 β 1 integrin interaction in this process [ 123 ] . Another study also demonstrated that the pretreatment of B16 – BL6 cells with either anti - α 4 β 1 or anti - VCAM - 1 antibodies ( M / K - 2 ) destroyed TNF α - enhanced pulmonary lung colonies [ 124 ] . In a previous study , we reported that VCAM - 1 is highly overexpressed in lung cancer tissues , and that high VCAM - 1 expression is closely associated with the poor survival of patients with lung cancer [ 119 ] . In this study , using the siRNA - mediated knockdown of VCAM - 1 , we identiﬁed VCAM - 1 as a key molecule regulating the invasion of A549 lung cancer cells . Then , using phage display technology , we developed a novel human monoclonal antibody that is speciﬁc to human and mouse VCAM - 1 - D6 by isolating antibody clones from a human synthetic antibody library . We conﬁrmed that this antibody speciﬁcally inhibited the invasion of A549 and NCI - H1299 lung cancer cell lines , suggesting that VCAM - 1 - D6 may be a novel potential therapeutic target in VCAM - 1 - mediated lung cancer invasion . Taken together , these results suggest that targeting VCAM - 1 may be an effective strategy for regulating tumor metastasis . 5 . Conclusions VCAM - 1 is a key cell adhesion molecule involved in inﬂammation that is closely implicated in various immunological disorders , including rheumatoid arthritis , asthma , transplant rejection , and cancer ( Table 1 ) . VCAM - 1 is a potential therapeutic target in immunological disorders and cancer . The interaction of α 4 β 1 integrin , a major binding partner of VCAM - 1 , with Ig - like domain Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2018 , 19 , 1057 9 of 16 1 or 4 of VCAM - 1 is critical for the progression of rheumatoid arthritis , asthma , transplant rejection , angiogenesis , and metastasis . Additionally , our recent studies also suggest that the Ig - like domain 6 of VCAM - 1 is a potential therapeutic target in transplant rejection , angiogenesis , and tumor cell invasion ( Figure 2 ) . However , in order to understand the pathological mechanism of VCAM - 1 in immunological disorders and cancer , further research is necessary to identify VCAM - 1 domain - speciﬁc binding partners , and elucidate their regulatory mechanisms . Furthermore , the generation of interaction blockades that speciﬁcally inhibit the strong association between VCAM - 1 and its binding partners has been very challenging . Although some mouse monoclonal antibodies have been used for elucidating the role of VCAM - 1 in disease , we need to develop human or humanized antibodies that are speciﬁc to VCAM - 1 , less immunogenic , and have broad cross - species reactivity for preclinical and clinical studies . Luckily , the recent advent of recombinant antibody technology can overcome major hurdles for developing human antibodies that can be useful for either research or therapeutic use . Future studies with these speciﬁc blockades will create new avenues for better understanding the regulatory mechanisms of VCAM - 1 as a potential therapeutic target in immunological disorders and cancer .

Schematic representation of the speciﬁc role of each vascular cell adhesion molecule - 1 ( VCAM - 1 ) immunoglobulin ( Ig ) - like domain in immunological disorders and cancer . The direct interaction between Ig - like domain 1 ( D1 ) and / or domain 4 ( D4 ) of VCAM - 1 on activated endothelial cells and α 4 β 1 integrin ( blue circle ) on leukocytes is closely associated with asthma , rheumatoid arthritis , transplant rejection , tumor angiogenesis , and tumor metastasis ; Ig - like domain 6 ( D6 ) of VCAM - 1 is important in transplant rejection , tumor angiogenesis , and tumor cell invasion . However , further research is necessary in order to identify the binding partners ( orange circle ) of D6 and their regulatory mechanisms .
