We analysed publicly available 10 transcriptome data from the brain and blood of 220 HD patients and 241 healthy controls and 11 identified 737 and 661 genes with robustly altered mRNA levels in the brain and blood of HD 12 patients , respectively . In the brain , a subnetwork of 320 genes strongly correlated with HD and 13 was enriched in transport - related genes . Bioinformatical analysis of this subnetwork 14 highlighted CDC42 , PAK1 , YWHAH , NFY , DLX1 , HMGN3 , and PRMT3 . Moreover , we 15 found that CREB1 can regulate 78 . 0 % of genes whose mRNA levels correlated with HD in the 16 blood of patients . Alterations in protein transport , metabolism , transcriptional regulation , and 17 CDC42 - mediated functions are likely central features of HD . Further our data substantiate the 18 role of transcriptional regulators that have not been reported in the context of HD ( e . g . DLX1 , 19 HMGN3 and PRMT3 ) and strongly suggest dysregulation of NFY and its target genes across 20 tissues . A large proportion of the identified genes such as CDC42 were also altered in 21 Parkinson’s ( PD ) and Alzheimer’s disease ( AD ) . The observed dysregulation of CDC42 and 22 YWHAH in samples from HD , AD and PD patients indicates that those genes and their 23 upstream regulators may be interesting therapeutic targets . 24 Keywords : Huntingtin / neurodegeneration / weighted gene co - expression network analyses / 25 robust rank aggregation analysis 26 Page 3 Introduction 27 Huntingtin ( HTT ) functions in diverse cellular processes such as autophagy , endocytosis , 28 vesicle transport , and transcriptional regulation [ 1 ] . A triplet repeat expansion in exon 1 of the 29 HTT gene results in the expansion of an N - terminal polyglutamine tract and causes 30 Huntington’s disease ( HD ) [ 2 ] . Clinically , a progressive loss of motor functions , cognitive 31 impairment , and psychiatric symptoms such as depression and anxiety [ 3 ] characterises HD . 32 Besides neurological symptoms , HD patients suffer from a plethora of non - neuronal symptoms 33 such as cardiac failure , muscle atrophy , impaired glucose tolerance , osteoporosis , weight loss , 34 and testicular atrophy [ 4 ] . 35 Expansion of the N - terminal polyQ tract impairs the multi - faceted function of HTT and its 36 interaction with numerous other proteins [ 5 , 6 ] . Mutant huntingtin ( mHTT ) , for instance , 37 induces the activation of microglia , leading to increased secretion of interleukin - 1β ( IL - 1β ) , 38 tumour necrosis factor - alpha ( TNF ) and increased levels of reactive oxygen and nitrogen 39 species [ 7 ] . Tabrizi et al . and Fan and Raymond showed that mHTT impairs the glutamate 40 uptake in astrocytes leading to excitotoxicity [ 8 , 9 ] . Aberrant splicing of the mHTT mRNA 41 results in the formation of a truncated HTT exon - 1 protein forming nuclear and cytoplasmic 42 inclusions [ 10 ] . R6 / 2 mice with a knock - in of exon - 1 of human HTT show a more severe 43 disease progression than mouse models with a knock - in of full - length mutant HTT [ 10 ] . The 44 study of several huntingtin - interaction partners and their impaired function in HD further 45 suggested impaired trafficking of clathrin - coated and non - coated vesicles in HD patients 46 [ 11 , 12 ] . Transcriptomic studies of HD patients , cell lines , and mouse models expressing mHTT 47 observed transcriptional dysregulation of a plethora of genes [ 13 – 19 ] such as differential 48 regulation of genes involved in neuronal differentiation [ 14 , 16 ] , heat shock response [ 13 ] , 49 mRNA processing [ 20 ] , immune response and neuroinflammation [ 14 ] . Several mechanisms 50 behind the broad transcriptional dysregulation such as altered expression of enhancer RNAs 51 Page 4 [ 21 ] , sequestration of transcription factors ( e . g . CREB1 , TBP , or mSin3a ) [ 22 – 25 ] , or the 52 sequestration of proteins such as the muscleblind - like splicing regulator 1 ( MBNL1 ) , nucleolin , 53 and proteins of the small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) machinery [ 26 , 27 ] have been discussed . 54 Previously published analyses of transcriptomic profiles from HD patients [ 13 – 19 ] yielded 55 varying results . Since a thorough knowledge of pathological mechanisms behind HD is 56 essential for the design of further biochemical studies and development of therapies , we 57 performed a meta - analysis of publicly available transcriptomic data from HD patients to 58 identify genes altered in several studies . Within our meta - analysis , we found 661 and 737 genes 59 with robustly altered mRNA levels in the blood and brain of HD patients , respectively . Strongly 60 suggesting that dysfunction in protein transport and metabolism are central in HD , we identified 61 by weighted gene co - expression network analysis a subnetwork of 320 genes , enriched in genes 62 functioning in protein transport that strongly correlated with HD in the brain . Additionally , we 63 identified the cell division cycle 42 ( CDC42 ) , p21 ( CDC42 / RAC1 ) Activated Kinase 1 64 ( PAK1 ) , 14 - 3 - 3 protein eta ( YWHAH ) , and protein phosphatase - 2 catalytic subunit α ( PP2CA ) 65 as hub genes of this subnetwork . Transcription factor enrichment analysis ( TFEA ) highlighted 66 distal - less homeobox 1 ( DLX1 ) , high mobility group nucleosomal binding domain 3 67 ( HMGN3 ) , and protein arginine methyltransferase 3 ( PRMT3 ) in this subnetwork . A signature 68 of 74 and 41 genes , including CDC42 and YWHAH , were also altered in the brain of PD ( Figure 69 5 and Additional file 7 ) and in AD and PD patients , respectively . Similarly , a subnetwork of 70 118 genes , including genes coding for constituents of the Arp2 / Arp3 complex , were 71 significantly altered in the blood of HD patients . Strikingly , 78 . 0 % of the genes in this blood 72 subnetwork were direct or indirect targets of CREB1 . 73 Results 74 Transcriptional changes in the brain of HD patients 75 Since neurological and neuropsychiatric symptoms are the pathognomonic features of HD and 76 Page 5 possess a high disease burden for HD patients , several transcriptomic studies investigated 77 transcriptional changes in the brain of HD patients . In this meta - analysis , we included three 78 published transcriptomic studies using post - mortem brain tissue from the prefrontal cortex 79 ( NCBI accession number : GSE33000 and GSE64810 ) [ 14 , 16 ] and the caudate nucleus of 80 prodromal HD patients ( NCBI accession number GSE129473 ) [ 13 ] ( Table 1 ) . As described 81 above , this meta - analysis aimed at identifying promising candidates for further functional 82 studies and improving our understanding of transcription factors and mechanism , which are 83 mainly affected in the brain of HD patients . 84 To identify genes with significantly altered mRNA levels in those three studies , we determined 85 differentially expressed genes for each study separately , ranked them after their absolute Z - ratio 86 and performed a robust rank aggregation analysis ( RRA ) . Thereby , we identified 737 87 differentially expressed genes ( RRA score < 0 . 05 ) that were among the most altered genes in 88 the analysed datasets ( Additional file 1 ) . 89 Based on all genes identified by RRA ( Additional file 1 ) , we performed a weighted gene co - 90 expression analysis ( WGCNA ) to identify gene modules , i . e . clusters of highly correlated 91 genes . Adjacency and the topological overlap matrix ( TOM ) for the gene network were 92 calculated with a soft - thresholding power β of 14 . 5 for which the WGCNA network satisfies 93 the criterion of scale - free topology ( R² = 0 . 85 ) ( Additional file 2 ) . By module - based clustering 94 with the diagonal , varying volume , and shape model ( VVI ) , we identified nine modules of 95 which the module eigengenes ( first principal component ) of seven modules ( black , blue , red , 96 brown , magenta , and turquoise ) statistically significantly correlated with disease state ( HD 97 patients versus healthy individuals ) as determined by correlation analysis ( Figure 1A ) . 98 Corroborating a potential link between genes in the black , brown and turquoise modules with 99 HD , we found a positive and statistically significant correlation between module membership , 100 defined as the probability that a gene belongs to this module , and gene significance , defined as 101 Page 6 the correlation between the expression values and the trait of interest , of 0 . 46 ( p = 0 . 004 ) , 0 . 47 102 ( p = 1e - 04 ) , and 0 . 41 ( p = 0 . 008 ) , respectively ( Figure 1A ) . Additionally , genes belonging to 103 the black and brown module showed a high mean gene significance ( Figure 1B ) . In contrast , 104 indicating that transcriptomic alterations of genes of the turquoise modules were less 105 pronounced than the genes of the black and brown module , we observed a low mean gene 106 significance of genes of this module . Corroborating the results of our network analysis , we 107 found that most of the identified genes or proteins are known to interact with several other 108 proteins belonging to the same module . For instance , according to the network analysis in 109 GeneMania , 94 . 05 % and 94 . 11 % of the genes are known to be co - expressed in humans . 110 Likewise , network analysis using the STRING database ( confidence cut - off = 0 . 4 ) [ 28 ] showed 111 that 34 of 53 proteins ( 64 . 2 % ) of the black and 36 of 81 proteins ( 44 . 4 % ) of the brown module 112 interact with at least one other protein ( data not shown ) . 113 Based on the clustering analysis of the modules eigengenes ( Figure 1C ) and the similarity of 114 the eigengene adjacency ( Figure 1D ) , we grouped the observed modules in three meta - modules : 115 the first meta - module ( M1 ) consisted of the black , blue , magenta , and red module , the second 116 meta - module ( M2 ) consisted of the brown , green and turquoise module , and the third meta - 117 module ( M3 ) consisted of the yellow and pink module . Combining the identified WGCNA 118 modules to meta - modules and subsequent analysis of this meta - modules demonstrated a high 119 correlation with HD ( correlation r = 0 . 5 , p - value = 1e - 38 ) , a positive correlation between gene 120 significance and module membership of 0 . 73 ( p - value = 2e - 54 ) , and the highest mean gene 121 significance of all meta - modules for M1 ( Figure 2A and B ) . Corroborating the importance of 122 genes belonging to M1 , the eigengene and adjacency of M1 clustered together with the disease 123 state ( Figure 2C and D ) . According to STRING , protein - protein interactions were strongly 124 enriched in M1 ( 826 observed edges , 602 expected edges , and p < 1 . 0e - 16 ) at minimal 125 interaction confidence of 0 . 4 . While the eigengene of M2 correlated with HD , we could not 126 observe a positive correlation between gene significance and module membership and , 127 Page 7 therefore , did not analyse this meta - module further . 128 Owing to the high similarity between modules of the same meta - module , we performed the 129 transcription factor enrichment analysis ( TFEA ) and the subsequent GO - term enrichment 130 analysis on the meta - modules M1 instead of single modules ( Figure 3A - D ) . Characterising 131 functional enrichment of genes belonging to the M1 subnetwork , we performed enrichment 132 analyses against the gene ontology ( GO ) and Reactome database . Using the GO database , we 133 found an enrichment of genes involved in protein transport ( GO : 0015031 , 12 . 8 % of genes in 134 M1 and FDR = 0 . 046 ) ( Figure 3A ) such as the Ras - related proteins 11A ( RAB11A ) , 2A 135 ( RAB2A ) , 14 ( RAB14 ) , syntaxin - 7 ( STX7 ) , syntaxin - 12 ( STX12 ) , or the sorting nexin 3 136 ( SNX3 ) in M1 . Among the three datasets , the 41 proteins that belonged to M1 and function in 137 protein transport processes showed a strong up - regulation in HD patient samples with a median 138 Z - ratio of 1 . 51 ( Figure 3B ) . To also include genes with lower Z - ratios into the functional 139 enrichment analyses , irrespective of their module membership , we additionally conducted gene 140 set enrichment analysis ( GSEA ) of the three datasets independently . Strongly suggesting that 141 the alteration of genes involved in protein transport may be relevant in HD , we found a strong 142 enrichment of proteins involved in the co - translational protein targeting to the membrane in all 143 three datasets by GSEA ( Figure 3E ) . Additionally , genes functioning in cellular metabolic 144 processes ( GO : 0044237 , 56 . 3 % of genes in M1 and FDR = 0 . 023 ) , cellular respiration 145 ( GO : 0045333 , 3 . 4 % of genes in M1 and FDR = 0 . 027 ) and translation ( GO : 0006412 , 5 . 6 % of 146 genes in M1 , and FDR = 0 . 023 ) were statistically significantly enriched in the M1 subnetwork . 147 Similarly , when using the Reactome database , we observed a strong enrichment of proteins 148 involved in protein metabolism , gene expression ( transcription ) and post - translational protein 149 modification ( Figure 3D ) . Using the network enrichment analysis test ( NEAT ) , we found a 150 highly statistically significant over - enrichment of 38 KEGG pathways in M1 ( Additional file 151 3 ) . Among these enriched pathways were “SNARE interaction in vesicular transport” ( adjusted 152 p - value = 1 . 74e - 33 ) , “RNA transport” ( adjusted p - value = 2 . 10E - 217 ) , and “mRNA 153 Page 8 surveillance pathway” ( adjusted p - value = 9 . 63E - 60 ) ( Additional file 3 ) . 154 To identify highly connected genes within the M1 subnetwork , we computed hub genes , i . e . 155 genes with high intramodular connectivity , gene significance and module membership ( Table 156 2 , Additional file 4 ) . Among these hub genes was CDC42 ( Z - ratios : 1 . 72 ; 1 . 83 ; 1 . 45 in 157 GSE33000 , GSE129473 and GSE64810 respectively ) , a membrane - associated small GTPase 158 that interacts with several effector proteins and thereby regulates cell migration [ 29 ] , the bipolar 159 attachment of spindle microtubules to kinetochores [ 30 ] , the extension and maintenance of the 160 formation of filopodia , the dedicator of cytokinesis 10 ( DOCK10 ) mediated spine formation 161 [ 31 ] , and the structural plasticity of dendritic spines [ 31 ] . Further corroborating the importance 162 of CDC42 in the subnetwork correlating with HD , CDC42 was additionally central in the M1 163 protein - protein interaction network , constructed using the STRING database ( Additional file 164 5 ) . Together with CDC42 , we identified 18 proteins with altered mRNA levels in all datasets 165 that were directly connected with CDC42 according to the STRING database . Further , CDC42 166 interacts with other identified hub proteins such as the P21 / Cdc42 / Rac1 - Activated Kinase 1 167 ( PAK1 ) [ 32 ] , 14 - 3 - 3 protein eta ( YWHAH ) , or the protein phosphatase 2 catalytic subunit α 168 ( PPP2CA ) . mRNA levels of the CDC42 small effector 2 ( CDC42SE2 ) , that functions 169 downstream of CDC42 , was upregulated in the brain of HD patients ( Z - ratios : 2 . 17 ; 0 . 97 ; 1 . 2 ) . 170 Additionally , CDC42 can interact with the CDC42 - interacting protein 4 ( CIP4 ) , also known as 171 thyroid hormone receptor interactor 10 ( TRIP10 ) and HTT [ 33 , 34 ] that was not robustly 172 dysregulated in our meta - analysis ( Z - ratios - 1 . 35 , - 0 . 03 , 0 . 51 ) . Besides the interaction of 173 CIP4 / TRIP10 with HTT and CDC42 , CIP4 / TRIP10 can interact with the vesicle - associated 174 membrane protein 2 ( VAMP2 ) and 7 ( VAMP7 ) which are linked with other genes robustly 175 altered in the brain of HD patients such as the vesicle - associated membrane protein 1 ( VAMP1 ) 176 and the Ras - related Protein Rab - 14 ( RAB14 ) [ 35 ] . 177 In addition , we identified PAK1 ( Z - ratios : 2 . 07 ; - 0 . 42 ; 0 . 299 ) , which can interact with CDC42 , 178 Page 9 as a hub gene in the M1 subnetwork . Additionally , the PAK1 Interacting Protein 1 ( PAK1IP1 ) , 179 which inhibits the activation of PAK1 by CDC42 through its interaction with the N - terminus 180 of PAK1 ( Xia et al , 2001 ) , was upregulated in the brain of HD patients in all studies ( Z - ratios : 181 1 . 88 ; 1 . 10 ; 1 . 98 ) . Since PAK1 , as well as PAK2 and PAK3 , belong to the group A PAKs [ 36 ] , 182 we also analysed mRNA levels of other group A PAKs . While PAK2 was not robustly altered 183 in the brain of HD patients ( Z - ratios : - 1 . 43 ; 1 . 31 ; 0 . 7 ) , PAK3 mRNA levels ( Z - ratios : 1 . 98 ; 184 0 . 46 ; 0 . 70 ) were slightly elevated in the brain of HD patients , although it was not identified by 185 RRA ( p = 0 . 10 ) . Both CDC42 and PAK1 are interacting with another hub gene , the protein 186 phosphatase 2 catalytic subunit alpha ( PPP2CA ) ( Z - ratios : 1 . 98 ; 0 . 74 ; 1 . 91 ) , which is an 187 important phosphatase for microtubule - associated proteins . PPP2CA was additionally the most 188 central protein in the network analysis of the M1 protein - protein interaction network 189 ( Additional file 5 ) . 190 Broad transcriptional dysregulation in HD was often linked to direct interaction of mHTT with 191 proteins of the small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) machinery [ 22 – 27 ] and different transcriptional 192 regulators such as CREB1 , TBP , mSin3a , MBNL1 , nucleolin , histone deacetylases ( HDACs ) , 193 or the DNA methyltransferase 1 ( DNMT1 ) . Therefore , we performed a transcription factor 194 enrichment analysis ( TFEA ) of the M1 subnetwork to define which transcription factors would 195 best explain the observed alterations in the brain of HD patients . Analysis of the target genes 196 of the top five TFEA hits , the mitochondrial transcription termination factor 3 ( MTERF3 ) , 197 Myb / SANT DNA binding domain containing 4 with coiled - coils ( MSANTD4 ) , small nuclear 198 RNA activating complex polypeptide 5 ( SNPAC5 ) , zinc finger protein 833 ( ZNF833 ) , and 199 thymocyte nuclear protein 1 ( THYN1 ) , showed that most of their target genes were upregulated 200 in the brain of HD patients ( Figure 4 and Additional file 6 ) . mRNA levels of MTERF3 , 201 MSANTD4 , SNPAC5 , ZNF833 and THYN1 were not consistently altered in the brain of HD 202 patients . Alongside with the mRNA levels of their target genes , mRNA levels of the distal - less 203 homeobox 1 ( DLX1 ) ( regulates 11 . 9 % of M1 , TFEA rank = 6 , Z - ratios : 2 . 21 ; 0 . 16 ; 1 . 04 ) , 204 Page 10 protein arginine methyltransferase 3 ( PRMT3 ) ( regulates 11 . 6 % of M1 , TFEA rank = 14 , Z - 205 ratios : 0 . 46 ; 2 . 65 ; 1 . 11 ) , and nuclear transcription factor Y subunit β ( NFYB ) ( regulates 29 . 7 206 % of M1 , TFEA rank = 24 , Z - ratios : 1 . 05 ; 2 . 39 ; 2 . 02 ) were robustly upregulated in the brain of 207 HD patients ( Figure 4 and Additional file 6 ) . Additionally , mRNA levels of the high mobility 208 group nucleosomal binding domain 3 ( HMGN3 ) ( regulates 24 . 1 % of M1 , TFEA rank = 13 , Z - 209 ratios : - 0 . 91 ; 1 . 90 ; 1 . 77 ) , that was additionally ranked high in the TFEA , appeared to be 210 upregulated in only two of three studies and slightly downregulated in the other study 211 ( Additional files 1 and 6 ) . Strikingly , we noted that transcriptions factors that have previously 212 been shown to be affected by mHTT such as CREB1 ( rank 182 ) or TBP ( rank 208 ) were ranked 213 low or could not be detected at all ( mSin3a ) by TFEA . 214 Besides the effects of mHTT on transcription factors , previous publications indicated that the 215 dysregulation of epigenetic modifiers such as DNMT1 or histone deacetylases ( HDACs ) 216 ( Federspiel et al , 2019 ; Siebzehnrübl et al , 2018 ; Moreno et al , 2016 ) might contribute to the 217 broad transcriptional dysregulation in HD . In our meta - analysis , HDCA2 ( Z - ratios : 0 . 69 , 1 . 84 , 218 1 . 86 ) and HDAC9 ( Z - ratios : 2 . 26 , 0 . 88 , 1 . 42 ) were upregulated in the brain of HD patients , 219 while the histone deacetylase 5 ( HDAC5 ) mRNA levels were decreased ( Z - ratios : - 0 . 18 ; - 2 . 17 ; 220 - 2 . 02 ) . By RRA , we did not identify DNMT1 , DNMT3A , or DNMT3B as robustly altered 221 genes . Nonetheless , we noted a downregulation of DNMT1 ( Z - ratio 0 . 48 ; - 1 . 35 , - 1 . 72 ) and 222 DNMT3A ( Z - ratio : 0 . 54 , - 1 . 38 , - 2 . 20 ) in datasets from Agus et al . 2019 and Labadorf et al . , 223 while both , DNMT1 and DNMT3A , were slightly upregulated in the larger dataset from 224 Narayanan et al . , 2014 . DNMT3B ( Z - ratio : - 0 . 76 ; - 0 . 31 ; - 0 . 79 ) was mostly unaltered in the 225 brain of HD patients in all datasets . 226 Taken together , mRNA levels of 320 genes of the M1 co - expression network strongly 227 correlated with HD and genes involved in protein transport and metabolism was enriched in 228 this co - expression subnetwork ( Figure 3A , B and D ) . CDC42 , PAK1 , YWHAH and PP2CA 229 Page 11 were identified as hub genes of this network . Especially substantiating on the relevance of 230 CDC42 , CDC42 has been indirectly linked with HD before [ 34 ] and can indirectly or directly 231 interact with other identified hubs and 18 other proteins with robustly altered mRNA levels in 232 the brain of HD patients . Further , the TFEA of the M1 subnetwork highlighted DLX1 , NFY 233 and HMGN3 as potential transcriptional regulators whose function might be affected in the 234 brain of HD patients . mRNA levels of several epigenetic modifiers such as HDAC2 , HDAC9 , 235 DNMT1 , and DNMT3A were additionally altered in at least two of the three studies using HD 236 brain samples . 237 A large proportion of differentially regulated genes in the brain of HD patients were also 238 altered in Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease 239 Previous transcriptomic studies have identified common transcriptional patterns between 240 Alzheimer’s disease ( AD ) and Parkinson’s disease ( PD ) [ 37 ] and between AD and HD [ 16 ] . 241 Hence , we compared the list of robustly altered genes in the brain of HD patients with the results 242 of a previous meta - analyses comparing transcriptional alterations in PD and AD [ 37 ] . Of the 243 737 genes with robustly altered mRNA levels in the brain of HD patients , that were identified 244 by RRA , 74 genes were also differentially expressed in PD and 41 genes were altered in all 245 three neurodegenerative diseases ( Additional file 7 ) . Strikingly , alterations of mRNA levels of 246 these genes were mostly reciprocal between HD and AD or PD , i . e . genes with an elevated 247 mRNA level in the brain of HD patients showed decreased mRNA levels in the brain of AD or 248 PD patients . 249 Analysing of the co - expression networks demonstrated that 100 % of these 74 genes were 250 annotated as co - expressed in the GeneMania database ( Figure 5A ) . 41 proteins whose mRNA 251 levels were altered in HD and PD have at least one annotated interaction partner ( Figure 5B ) . 252 While PPP2CA , YWHAH , RAB11A and CDC42 which have been identified as hub genes / 253 proteins in the M1 subnetwork network were also all central in the protein - protein interaction 254 Page 12 network ( Figure 5B and Additional file 5 ) of genes differentially expressed upon HD and PD , 255 only YWHAH was also central in the constructed co - expression network ( Figure 5A and 256 Additional file 5 ) . 257 Transcriptional changes in the blood of HD patients 258 As afore - described , HTT is ubiquitously expressed and HD symptoms are not confined to the 259 central nervous system [ 1 , 4 ] . Hence , we additionally analysed transcriptomic studies of blood 260 samples from HD patients and healthy controls ( Table 1 ) . Borovecki et al . 2005 ( GSE1751 ) 261 analysed the transcriptomic profile of twelve symptomatic and five presymptomatic HD 262 patients in comparison to 14 healthy controls , whereas Hu et al . 2011 ( GSE24520 ) included 263 venous cellular whole blood samples from 6 healthy controls and 8 HD patients . Transcriptomic 264 profiles of lymphocytes from 12 moderate stage HD patients and 10 age - matched healthy 265 controls were analysed by Runne et al . 2007 ( GSE8762 ) . 266 By robust rank aggregation ( RRA ) , we identified 661 genes differentially expressed upon HD 267 among the three datasets ( p < 0 . 05 ) ( Additional file 1 ) . Based on those 661 genes with a soft - 268 thresholding power β = 19 . 5 ( scale - free topology R2 = 0 . 87 ) ( Additional file 2 ) and subsequent 269 module - based clustering with the diagonal , equal volume , varying shape ( EVI ) model , we 270 identified nine WGCNA modules . Of these modules , the module eigengene of three modules 271 ( brown , pink , and yellow ) statistically significantly correlated with the disease state ( healthy 272 individuals versus HD ) ( Figure 6A ) . While genes of the brown module showed a negative 273 correlation between module membership and gene significance , genes of the pink and yellow 274 modules showed a positive correlation ( Figure 6A ) . Corroborating the importance of genes of 275 the pink and yellow modules , genes of these modules showed the highest mean gene 276 significance of all identified modules ( Figure 6B ) . Further , 94 . 12 % and 86 . 55 % of the genes 277 belonging to either the pink or yellow module were annotated by GeneMania to be co - expressed 278 in humans . Owing to the low distance between the modules eigengenes of the pink and yellow 279 Page 13 modules ( Figure 6C ) and the highly similar adjacency of these modules ( Figure 6D ) , we 280 combined these modules for further downstream analysis and will further refer to this module 281 as the blood meta - module ( MB ) . 282 Like the enrichment of the meta - module M1 identified in the brain samples , we found a strong 283 enrichment of proteins involved in transport ( FDR = 0 . 03 and 35 . 6 % of all genes in MB ) and 284 metabolic processes ( FDR = 0 . 03 and 66 . 9 % of all genes in MB ) in the MB subnetwork ( Figure 285 7A and B ) . Consistent with the enrichment of proteins involved in protein transport , we found 286 a strong enrichment of proteins localised to endosome membranes ( FDR = 0 . 002 and 9 . 3 % of 287 genes in MB ) ( Figure 7C ) . Among the 11 proteins localised to endosome membranes were the 288 vesicle - associated membrane protein 7 ( VAMP7 ) ( Z - ratios - 1 . 47 ; 0 . 99 ; 3 . 3 ) , a paralog of 289 VAMP2 that also displayed altered mRNA levels in the brain , and the sorting nexin 10 ( SNX10 ) 290 that is involved in membrane trafficking and protein sorting [ 38 ] . Additionally , we observed 291 dysregulation of the actin - related proteins ACTR2 / Arp2 ( Z - ratio : - 0 . 95 ; - 1 . 75 ; 3 . 15 ) , 292 ACTR3 / Arp3 ( - 1 . 92 ; - 1 . 62 ; 2 . 78 ) , and ARPC5 ( - 1 ; - 1 . 87 ; 2 . 24 ) that together with ARBC1A , 293 ARBC1B , ARPC3 , and ARPC4 form a seven - subunit protein complex playing an essential role 294 in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton [ 39 ] . By analysis of the MB protein - protein 295 interaction network , ACTR2 was the most important hub protein , which strongly substantiates 296 on its pathophysiological relevance in HD . Further indicating that transcriptional dysregulation 297 of regulators of the actin cytoskeleton may be important in HD , other actin - related proteins such 298 as ACTR3B ( Z - ratios : 1 . 3 ; 1 . 30 ; 1 . 62 ) , ACTR6 ( 1 . 38 ; 1 . 54 ; 1 . 88 ) and ACTR10 ( Z - ratios : 1 . 64 ; 299 1 . 23 ; 1 . 34 ) were robustly upregulated in the blood of HD patients according to this meta - 300 analysis . The alteration of mRNA levels of constituents of the Arp2 / 3 complex and actin - related 301 proteins further substantiates on the identification of CDC42 as an important hub gene in the 302 brain since CDC42 can activate the Arp2 / 3 complex through Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome 303 proteins [ 40 ] such as WAS , WASF1 , WASF2 , WASF3 , and WASL that appeared to be neither 304 robustly altered in the brain nor in the blood of HD patients . 305 Page 14 To identify transcription factors that can regulate the transcription of genes belonging to MB , 306 we performed a TFEA ( Additional file 6 ) . The CGG Triplet Repeat Binding Protein 1 307 ( CGGBP1 ) , zinc finger protein 654 ( ZNF654 ) , forkhead box N2 ( FOXN2 ) , and the specificity 308 protein 3 transcription factor ( SP3 ) were ranked at the top in the TFEA . Strikingly , transcription 309 of these transcriptional regulators is regulated by the cAMP - responsive element - binding 310 protein - 1 ( CREBP1 ) . CREB1 was also ranked high ( rank 15 ) in the TFEA and can regulate the 311 transcription of genes coding for constituents of the Arp2 / 3 complex and hub genes of the MB 312 subnetwork such as membrane - associated ring - CH - type finger 7 ( MARCH 7 ) , pumilio RNA 313 binding family member 2 ( PUM2 ) , survival motor neuron domain containing 1 ( SMNDC1 ) , or 314 zinc finger DHHC - type palmitoyltransferase 17 ( ZDHHC17 ) , also known as the huntingtin - 315 interacting protein 14 ( HIP14 ) . CREB1 together with the other enriched transcription factors 316 regulated by CREB1 ( TET2 , SP3 , RLF , CGGBP1 , ZNF148 , FOXN2 , ZNF654 , ZBTB11 , and 317 ZNF770 ) regulates the transcription of 92 from 118 ( 78 . 0 % ) genes belonging to MB 318 ( Additional file 8 ) . 319 Taken together , the enrichment of proteins localised to endosome membranes further 320 corroborates the above - described alteration of protein - transport - related genes in the brain of 321 HD patients . The dysregulation of several constituents of the Arp2 / 3 complex , that is activated 322 by CDC42 , substantiates on the relevance of actin cytoskeleton dysregulation in HD . 323 52 genes were differentially regulated in the blood and brain of HD patients 324 As noted before , the ubiquitous expression of HTT [ 1 ] and the clinical manifestation of HD 325 outside the central nervous system [ 4 ] indicates that transcriptomic changes caused by polyQ 326 expansion of HTT may be not confined to nervous tissues . According to our meta - analysis , 52 327 genes were dysregulated in brain - and blood - derived samples from HD patients ( Additional file 328 1 ) . 329 Based on the genes / proteins altered in the blood and brain of HD patients , we constructed a 330 Page 15 protein - protein interaction network ( Figure 8 ) to investigate the relationship between the 331 identified genes . Furthermore , to identify transcription factors that might explain the observed 332 transcriptomic alterations , we conducted a transcription factor enrichment analysis . While 333 82 . 4 % of the proteins were annotated as co - expressed by GeneMania ( data not shown ) , 48 . 1 % 334 were interacting with a least one other protein according to the STRING databases ( interaction 335 cutoff : 0 . 4 ) . 336 In our meta - analysis , we noted that mRNA levels of the zinc finger DHHC - Type 337 palmitoyltransferase 13 ( ZDHHC13 ) , i . e . huntingtin - interacting protein 14 ( HIP14 ) , and the 338 zinc finger DHHC - Type palmitoyltransferase 17 ( ZDHHC17 ) , i . e . huntingtin - interacting 339 protein 14 - like protein ( HIP14L ) were mostly elevated in the blood and brain of HD 340 patients . Previous studies linked the altered interaction between mHTT and ZDHHC17 and 341 ZDHHC13 with altered regulation of the striatal N - Methyl - D - Aspartate Receptor ( NMDA ) 342 trafficking [ 41 ] . 343 TFEA analysis of the 52 genes altered in the blood and brain of HD samples highlighted the 344 enrichment of NFY target genes ( rank 3 ) ( Additional file 6 ) . NFY is a trimeric complex of 345 proteins coded by the NFYA , NFYB , and NFYC genes . Besides the high ranking of NFYB in 346 the combined dataset ( rank 3 ) , targets of NFYB were also enriched in the M1 ( brain , rank 24 ) 347 and the blood ( rank 48 ) ( Additional file 6 ) . Moreover , NFYB ( Z - ratios in the brain datasets : 348 1 . 05 , 2 . 39 , 2 . 02 ) mRNA - levels and NFYB target genes ( mean Z - ratio : 1 . 62 ) were also 349 increased in the brain of HD patients ( Figure 5 and Additional file 1 ) . 350 HMGN3 , NFY and CDC42 mRNA were additionally altered in the striatum of YAC128 351 and R6 / 2 mice and predictive for HD 352 To further substantiate on the relevance of identified hub genes or transcriptional regulators 353 such as CDC42 , PAK1 , YWHAH , DLX1 , HMGN3 , or NFY , we analysed transcriptomic 354 alterations in the striatum of R6 / 2 [ 42 ] and YAC128 mice [ 43 ] ( Additional file 9 ) . Furthermore , 355 Page 16 we assessed how accurate control and HD mice can be discriminated based on mRNA levels of 356 these genes ( Additional file 10 and 11 ) . 357 Indicating that NFY may play a role in HD across tissues , TFEA of the subnetworks M1 and 358 MB and the combined dataset highlighted NFY . Like in human HD patients , NFYA ( Z - ratios : 359 1 . 75 , 0 . 77 , 1 . 93 in R6 / 2 , 12 - month - old YAC128 , and 24 - month - old YAC128 mice 360 respectively ) and NFYB ( Z - ratios : 1 . 31 , 0 . 45 , 1 . 38 ) mRNA levels were elevated in R6 / 2 and 361 YAC128 mice . Additionally , control and HD mice could be well discriminated based on NFYA 362 ( AUC = 0 . 86 ; 95 % CI = [ 0 . 71 , 1 ] ) , and NFYB ( AUC = 0 . 79 ; 95 % CI = [ 0 . 60 , 0 . 98 ] ) mRNA 363 levels ( Additional files 8 - 10 ) . 364 In contrast , HMGN3 was only highlighted by TFEA of the M1 module , correlating with HD in 365 the brain , and not in the blood datasets which may imply that dysregulation of HMGN3 may be 366 confined to the brain In R6 / 2 and YAC128 mice , HMGN3 mRNA levels were elevated ( Z - 367 ratios : 1 . 89 , 0 . 78 , 2 . 06 ) in HD mice and control and HD mice could be well discriminated based 368 on the HMGN3 mRNA levels . ( AUC = 0 . 89 ; 95 % CI = [ 0 . 76 , 1 ] ) ( Additional files 8 - 10 ) . 369 In concert with a more pronounced HD phenotype in 24 - month YAC128 and R6 / 2 mice than 370 in 12 - month - old YAC128 mice , the increase of HMGN3 , NFYA , and NFYB mRNA levels 371 positively correlated with the age of YAC128 . This raises the possibility that HMGN3 , NFYA , 372 and NFYB mRNA levels might be utilised as markers for disease progression and severity . 373 However , further investigations on the usability of those genes as biomarkers in larger patient 374 cohorts are required . Further , it should be clarified whether alteration of mRNA levels HMGN3 , 375 NFY , their target genes are specific for HD or whether they are present in other 376 neurodegenerative diseases . 377 DLX1 and PRMT3 mRNA levels , which were both also highlighted by TFEA , were only 378 elevated in the striatum of R6 / 2 mice but appeared to be unaffected in YAC128 mice . Like in 379 the brain samples of HD patients , we observed a robust downregulation of DNMT3A ( Z - ratios : 380 Page 17 - 1 . 24 , - 1 . 79 , - 1 . 14 ) in the striatum of R6 / 2 and YAC128 mice and the mice could be 381 discriminated based on DNMT3A levels ( AUC = 0 . 83 ; 95 % CI = [ 0 . 66 , 0 . 99 ] ) . In disagreement 382 with the analysis of brain samples from HD patients , DNMT1 and DNMT3B levels were not 383 consistently altered in the striatum of R6 / 2 and YAC128 mice . 384 Further corroborating the importance of CDC42 dysregulation in HD , CDC42 mRNA levels 385 were elevated in the striatum of R6 / 2 and YAC128 ( Z - ratios : 1 . 24 , 1 . 18 , 1 . 88 ) . Additionally , 386 control and HD mice could be discriminated based on CDC42 mRNA levels ( AUC = 0 . 85 ; 95 % 387 CI = [ 0 . 68 , 1 ] ) . mRNA level of PAK1 , that was identified as a hub gene in the M1 subnetwork 388 and correlated with HD , was merely elevated in YAC128 mice ( Z - ratios : 1 . 47 , 2 . 08 ) , but was 389 mostly unaffected in R6 / 2 mice ( Z - ratio : - 0 . 45 ) . 390 Discussion 391 In our meta - analysis , we intended to identify by RRA , WGCNA and network analysis robust 392 transcriptomic changes underlying HD . To this end , we included transcriptomic studies 393 analysing different human brain regions and tissues from symptomatic and prodromal HD 394 patients . Thereby , we identified subnetworks of 320 ( M1 ) or 118 ( MB ) genes with robustly 395 altered mRNA levels in the brain and blood of HD patients , respectively . Network analysis of 396 differentially expressed genes in the brain highlighted CDC42 , PAK1 , YWHAH , and PP2CA 397 as hub genes of the M1 subnetwork . Additionally , we identified a signature of 74 and 41 genes , 398 including CDC42 and YWHAH , that were altered in the brain of PD and HD ( Figure 5 and 399 Additional file 7 ) and AD , PD and HD patients , respectively . In the blood , we identified a 400 subnetwork of 118 genes , including genes coding for several constituents of the Arp2 / 3 401 complex that is activated by CDC42 . TFEA highlighted the relevance of several already 402 described ( e . g . CREB1 and NFY ) or novel ( e . g . DLX1 , PRMT3 and HMGN3 ) transcription 403 factors that may play a role in HD . In conclusion , our analysis suggests that dysregulation of 404 transcription factors and epigenetic modifiers , cellular metabolism , actin cytoskeleton and 405 Page 18 SNARE complex proteins play an important role in the pathology of HD ( Figure 8 ) . 406 As noted before , the pathology of HD is neither confined to certain brain regions nor the brain 407 [ 4 ] . A succesful HD therapy should , therefore , target a gene or protein that is not exclusively 408 altered in a certain brain region or tissue . Hence , we analysed RNA data from different brain 409 regions and blood samples in our meta - analysis , although an increased interstudy variability , 410 reducing the sensitivity with which differentially expressed genes are identified , may argue 411 against the combined analysis of different brain regions . Furthermore , certain limitations for 412 the interpretation and combined analysis of transcriptomic data from different studies should 413 be considered : although authors of the original publications strictly controlled RNA quality 414 before RNA sequencing or microarray analysis , small changes in RNA quality might impair 415 transcript quantification and subsequently also the results of this meta - analysis . Second , post - 416 mortem samples from HD patients who died from HD can only provide insights into 417 transcriptional changes at the end stage of HD that do not necessarily reflect changes at disease 418 onset or during disease progression . Third , neurodegeneration in the brain of HD patients in 419 late disease stages poses the risk that some of the observed alterations are caused by changes in 420 tissue composition . Bearing the danger of altered tissue composition as a confounding factor in 421 mind , we also included the dataset from Agus et al . 2019 who analysed early - stage , prodromal 422 HD patients in which neuronal loss was less pronounced [ 13 ] . 423 Several studies have shown that HTT and its interactors such as the huntingtin - associated 424 protein 1 ( HAP1 ) or the huntingtin - interacting protein 1 ( HIP1 ) participate in protein transport 425 and the organisation of the cytoskeleton [ 1 ] . RNAi - mediated silencing of the huntingtin - 426 interacting protein 1 related ( HIP1R ) , also known as huntingtin - interacting protein 12 ( HIP12 ) , 427 for instance , led to the stable association of clathrin - coated structures and their endocytic cargo 428 to dynamin , actin , the Arp2 / 3 complex , and cortactin [ 44 , 45 ] . Furthermore , HAP1 regulates 429 synaptic vesicle exocytosis [ 46 ] and neuronal endocytosis through its interaction with the Sec23 430 Page 19 homolog A , COPII coat complex component ( SEC23A ) and the clathrin light chain B [ 47 ] . In 431 line with previous findings that HTT and its interactors regulate the cytoskeleton and transport 432 processes and substantiating that impairments of these functions contribute to the 433 pathophysiology of HD , we identified CDC42 as a hub gene in the M1 subnetwork that was 434 highly correlated with HD in transcriptomic studies of post - mortem brain samples . CDC42 435 mRNA levels were also elevated in the brain of HD patients and in the striatum of R6 / 2 and 436 YAC128 mice . In contrast to HD , CDC42 mRNA levels were decreased in brain of AD and PD 437 patients [ 37 ] . Besides , mRNA levels of several constituents of the Arp2 / Arp3 complex 438 ( ACTR2 / Arp2 : blood ; ACTR3 / Arp3 : blood and brain ; ACTR3B : brain ; ARPC5 : blood ; 439 ACTR6 : brain ) , that interacts with the HIP1R - cortactin complex and is activated by CDC42 , 440 were altered in HD patients . mRNA levels of VAMP1 , an indirect CDC42 interactor , were 441 robustly upregulated in all studies using HD brain samples ( Additional file 1 ) . mRNA levels of 442 VAMP2 and VAMP7 were additionally altered in the HD blood samples ( Additional file 1 ) , 443 although these alterations were not consistent across the different studies . VAMPs are major 444 constituents of protein complexes involved in the docking and fusion of vesicles [ 48 ] . These 445 complexes are comprised of VAMPs , other syntaxins , the synaptosome associated protein 25 446 ( SNAP - 25 ) , the N - ethylmaleimide - sensitive factor - like protein ( NSF ) , the NSF - attachment 447 proteins alpha ( NAPA , SNAPA ) , beta ( NAPB / SNAPB ) , gamma ( NAPG / SNPAG ) , and 448 SNAP receptors ( SNARE ) . Corroborating our finding that the mRNA levels of VAMPs were 449 altered in the brain and blood of HD patients and the striatum of R6 / 2 and YAC128 mice ( this 450 study ) , VAMP2 protein levels were also increased in striatal synaptosomes of Hdh140Q / 140Q 451 mice [ 49 ] . On the contrary , protein levels of other proteins involved in the docking and fusion 452 of vesicles such as SNAP - 25 or rabphilin 3a were reduced in the post - mortem cortex of HD 453 patients [ 50 ] . Additionally , analysis of 175Q - HTT knock - in mice demonstrated altered levels 454 of other proteins involved in synaptic function ( SNAP - 25 , Rab3A , and PSD95 ) , axonal 455 transport , and microtubules ( dynein , dynactin , and KIF3A ) [ 51 ] . Additionally , HTT can interact 456 Page 20 with SNAP25 , and the SNAP25 - associated proteins syntaxin 1A ( STX1A ) and calcium 457 voltage - gated channel auxiliary subunit alpha2delta 1 ( CACNA2D1 ) [ 52 ] . Raising the 458 possibility that HTT and its abundant interactor , the huntingtin - associated protein 40 ( HAP40 ) , 459 plays a role in docking and fusion of synaptic vesicles , we previously found that constituents 460 of this complex , the N - ethylmaleimide - sensitive factor attachment proteins alpha ( NAPA , 461 SNAPA ) , beta ( NAPB / SNAPB ) , and gamma ( NAPG / SNPAG ) are the closest homologs of 462 HAP40 [ 53 ] . 463 Besides proteins of the SNARE complex , we identified other proteins linked with CDC42 in 464 our network analysis of transcriptomic data from brain tissue of HD patients . For instance , 465 PAK1 , identified as a hub gene in the subnetwork M1 , and its interactor PAK1IP1 showed 466 robust upregulation in HD patients . The PAK proteins , PAK1 and PAK3 , are central regulators 467 of neuronal development and activating PAK1 mutations were aetiologic for secondary 468 macrocephaly , developmental delay , ataxic gait and seizures in two unrelated patients [ 36 ] . 469 Double knock - out of PAK1 / PAK3 in mice affected brain size and structure [ 54 ] . Linking PAKs 470 with HTT , Luo and Rubinszstein showed a physical interaction between HTT and PAK1 [ 55 ] 471 and siRNA - mediated silencing of PAK1 and PAK2 reduced mutant HTT toxicity and 472 aggregation [ 55 , 56 ] . PAK2 knock - down in the murine striatal cell line STHdh ( Q111 ) also 473 reduced mutant HTT toxicity [ 57 ] . 474 As afore - mentioned , we found that 78 % of the genes of the subnetwork MB , which strongly 475 correlated with HD in the blood ( Figure 6 ) , were directly or indirectly regulated by CREB1 476 ( Additional files 6 and 7 ) . CREB1 , a leucine zipper transcription factor , activates the 477 transcription of genes upon binding to the cAMP - response element ( CRE ) . Steffan et al . 478 previously showed that the CREB1 - binding protein ( CBP ) , a transcriptional coactivator of 479 CREB1 , can interact with HTT [ 22 ] . In a transcriptomic study of subcutaneous adipose tissue 480 obtained from HD patients , CREB1 target genes were enriched , and the CREB1 mRNA levels 481 Page 21 were significantly increased ( McCourt et al , 2015 ) . Substantiating the physiological importance 482 of CREB1 , the double knock - out of CREB - 1 and the cAMP - responsive element modulator 483 ( CREM ) in mice ( Creb1 Nescre Crem - / - ) led to severe neuronal loss during brain development and 484 perinatal death [ 58 ] . A conditional , postnatal knock - out of Creb1 and Crem , showed 485 considerable atrophy in the striatum and hippocampus and a dystonic phenotype [ 58 ] . 486 Indicating that the loss - of - function of CREB1 in mice can partly be compensated by CREM , 487 neither the loss of CREB1 nor CREM alone induced neurodegeneration in mice [ 58 ] . While we 488 also found a strong enrichment of CREB1 target genes in our MB subnetwork by TFEA , 489 CREB1 mRNA levels appeared to be unaltered in all analysed datasets . As afore - mentioned , 490 TFEA of the M1 subnetwork consisting of genes with robustly altered mRNA levels in the brain 491 of HD patients did not highlight CREB1 . The finding that CREB1 targets were not enriched in 492 the M1 subnetwork ( Additional file 6 ) in combination with the data from Mantamadiotis et al . , 493 raises the possibility that CREB1 function may be affected in the brain of HD patients , but the 494 CREB1 dysfunction is compensated by CREM or other transcription factors . In contrast , 495 CREB1 dysfunction might not be compensated outside the brain due to the lack of detectable 496 CREM protein expression in blood cells [ 59 ] . Another transcription factor whose transcription 497 is controlled by CREB1 and whose target genes were enriched in the MB subnetwork is SP3 . 498 The dual treatment of R6 / 2 mice with mithramycin , inhibiting SP3 , and cystamine reduced the 499 hypertrimethylation of histone H3 and extended their overall survival over 40 % [ 60 ] . The 500 alteration of the activity or mRNA levels of CREB1 might also partly explain observed 501 alterations in mRNA levels of CDC42 and constituents of the Arp2 / 3 complex ( this meta - 502 analysis ) since CREB can regulate their transcription . 503 The TFEA performed in this study also highlighted the enrichment of NFY target genes in the 504 M1 and MB subnetwork as well as in the dataset of genes affected in both tissues . In the brain 505 of HD patients , mRNA levels of NFYB and its target genes were elevated ( Figure 5 , Additional 506 file 8 ) . Further corroborating that the dysregulation of NFY and its target genes may be 507 Page 22 important in HD , van Hagen et al . found an enrichment of NFY target genes among a gene 508 cluster that was differentially expressed in rat PC12 cells expressing the exon 1 of human 74Q - 509 HTT [ 61 ] . Aggregates of mutant HTT can interact in vitro and in the mouse brain with NFY 510 and thereby reduce transcription of the NFY target gene HSP70 [ 62 ] . On the other hand , our 511 meta - analysis may indicate that the transcriptional activity and transcription of NFY might be 512 increased in the brain of HD patients , R6 / 2 and YAC128 mice . With regards to the currently 513 available data on the role of NFY in HD , we cannot exclude the possibility that elevated mRNA 514 levels of NFY and its target genes are caused by a compensatory mechanism to restore NFY 515 function . This scenario may explain why transcription of NFY targets was reduced in one study 516 [ 62 ] , while we observed increased transcription of NFY and its targets . 517 Besides NFY and CREB - 1 , TFEA ( Additional file 6 ) of the M1 subnetwork of genes altered in 518 the brain of HD patients highlighted DLX1 , PRMT3 , and HMGN3 that may be involved in 519 astrocyte maturation [ 63 ] . To our knowledge , this is the first study which indicates a potential 520 role of DLX1 , PRMT3 , and HMGN3 dysfunction in HD . As noted above , DLX1 mRNA levels 521 were only upregulated in the brain of HD patients in two studies , while it appeared to be 522 unaffected in the third study analysing the caudate nucleus of prodromal HD patients . 523 Additionally , DLX - 1 mRNA levels were elevated in the striatum of R6 / 2 mice , while it was 524 unaltered in the striatum of YAC128 mice . Besides the role of DLX1 in the adult brain , DLX1 525 plays also an important role in brain development ; DLX1 , together with NOLZ - 1 and DLX2 , 526 regulates the migration of striatal neurones to the dorsal or ventral striatum and the identity of 527 striatal projection neurones [ 64 ] . Chen et al . also demonstrated that the knock - out of NOLZ - 1 , 528 also known as zinc finger protein 503 ( ZNF503 ) , in mice led to an upregulation of DLX1 / 2 and 529 an aberrant neuronal migration from the dorsal to the ventral striatum [ 64 ] . Demonstrating that 530 elevated DLX1 / DLX2 levels were causative for the aberrant neuronal migration , restoration of 531 the altered DLX1 / DLX2 levels in NOLZ - 1 knock - out mice rescued the aberrant neuronal 532 migration [ 64 ] . A conditional DLX1 knock - out in cortical interneurons in mice reduced the 533 Page 23 excitatory input , fewer excitatory synapses and hypoplastic dendrites [ 65 ] which substantiated 534 on the relevance of DLX1 beyond the striatum . Additionally , DLX1 knock - down in 535 interneurons enhanced dendritic growth through neuropilin - 2 and PAK3 [ 66 ] , that was also 536 slightly upregulated in the brain of HD patients ( Z - ratios : 1 . 98 ; 0 . 46 ; 0 . 70 ) according to this 537 meta - analysis . PRMT3 , a protein methyltransferase whose mRNA levels were elevated in the 538 brain of HD patients and the striatum of R6 / 2 mice ( this study ) but neither in the blood nor the 539 striatum of YAC128 mice , is essential for dendritic spine maturation in the rat hippocampus 540 [ 67 ] and neuronal development [ 68 ] . Due to a more rapid disease progression and disease onset 541 in R6 / 2 than YAC128 mice [ 69 , 70 ] , the elevation of DLX - 1 and PRMT3 mRNA levels in the 542 striatum of R6 / 2 but not in YAC128 mice raises the possibility that the dysregulation of DLX - 543 1 and PRMT3 occurs in later disease stages and is more pronounced upon expression of the 544 HTT - exon1 fragment . 545 Conclusion 546 Here , we identified , by RRA and WGCNA , subnetworks of 320 ( M1 ) and 118 ( MB ) genes with 547 robustly altered mRNA levels in the brain and blood of HD patients , resp . In the brain , CDC42 , 548 PAK1 , YWHAH , and PP2CA were highlighted as hub genes of the M1 subnetwork ( Additional 549 file 4 ) , that appears to be enriched in genes functioning in protein transport ( Figure 3 ) . We also 550 identified a signature of 74 and 41 genes , including CDC42 and YWHAH , that were altered in 551 the brain of PD and HD ( Figure 5 and Additional file 7 ) and AD , PD and HD patients , 552 respectively . In blood , we identified a subnetwork of 118 genes , including genes coding for 553 several constituents of the Arp2 / 3 complex that is activated by CDC42 . TFEA ( Figure 5 and 554 Additional file 6 ) highlighted the relevance of CREB1 in the pathology of HD since the 555 transcription of 78 . 0 % of genes altered in the blood of HD patients were directly or indirectly 556 regulated by CREB1 . Furthermore , DLX1 , PRMT3 , HMGN3 and NFY target genes were 557 enriched in the identified modules . HMGN3 , NFYA , NFYB , and CDC42 mRNA levels were 558 Page 24 additionally altered in R6 / 2 and YAC128 mice ( Additional file 9 ) and could be used to 559 discriminate between control and HD mice ( Additional files 10 and 11 ) . Indicating that the 560 upregulation of DLX1 and PRMT3 transcription may occur in later disease stages , DLX - 1 and 561 PRMT3 mRNA levels were merely elevated in R6 / 2 mice but not in YAC128 mice that show 562 a less severe HD phenotype than R6 / 2 mice . 563 Our results strongly suggest that abnormal protein transport , cytoskeletal organization , and 564 transcriptional regulation might be central features in the pathophysiology of HD ( figure 8 ) . 565 Furthermore , our study substantiates the role of CDC42 , previously identified HTT interactors 566 ( e . g . PAK1 , and PAK2 ) and transcriptional regulators ( e . g . CREB1 and NFY ) which have been 567 reported to be sequestered to mutant HTT aggregates . Most interestingly , our data indicate a 568 potential pathophysiological role of DLX - 1 , HMGN3 and PRMT3 in HD that have not been 569 reported before . 570 Methods 571 Retrieval and tiding of datasets 572 In our meta - analysis , we analysed transcriptomic studies that were published in a peer - reviewed 573 journal and whose raw data were publicly available . Furthermore , we excluded transcriptomic 574 studies with less than eight samples from HD patients . To analyse post - mortem brain tissue , we 575 retrieved data from the Gene Ontology Omnibus ( GEO ) database of the National Center for 576 Biotechnology Information ( NCBI ) with the accession number GSE33000 [ 16 ] , GSE129473 577 [ 13 ] , and GSE64810 [ 14 ] . For the analysis of blood samples from HD patients , raw data were 578 retrieved from the GEO database with the accession numbers GSE1751 [ 19 ] , GSE24250 [ 17 ] , 579 and GSE8762 [ 18 ] . If genes were measured by several probes , the average of all probes of the 580 respective genes was used . In our meta - analysis , we excluded samples from presymptomatic 581 HD patients due to a low patient number . 582 Page 25 Missing data in the dataset GSE33000 were imputed by sequential and random hot - deck 583 imputation as implement in the R - package VIM [ 71 ] since we assumed missing at random after 584 graphical analysis of missing values by the R - function matrixplot ( VIM package ) [ 72 ] . We 585 normalised raw transcript - levels by quantile - normalisation using the R function 586 normalize . quantiles . robust from the package preprocessCore ( Bolstad , 2019 ) and , afterwards , 587 converted them into Z - Scores . 588 Robust rank aggregation analysis ( RRA ) 589 To obtain a list of robustly altered genes , we computed Z - ratios according to the method 590 proposed by Cheadle et al . , 2003 [ 73 ] and ranked them after their absolute Z - ratio . The sorted 591 transcript lists were analysed with RRA , as implemented in the R package RobustRankAggreg 592 [ 74 ] . RRA is a distribution - based and parameter - free method that detects genes ranked 593 consistently better than expected for uncorrelated genes ( null hypothesis ) and computes an 594 significance score based on an probabilistic model [ 74 ] . The used the RRA algorithm previously 595 showed a higher robustness to outliers , noise , and errors than other rank aggregation methods 596 [ 74 ] . 597 We included transcripts with a RRA score < 0 . 05 in the further downstream analysis and 598 performed clustering analysis and plotting of the heatmaps with the function heatmap . 2 599 implemented in the R - package gplots ( version 3 . 0 . 3 ) [ 75 ] . 600 Generation of weighted correlation networks 601 For the weighted correlation network analysis ( WGCNA ) , the signed co - expression networks 602 were build using the R - package WGCNA [ 76 ] . Correlation between genes was computed by 603 biweight midcorrelation [ 76 ] to compute adjacency matrices . Based on the scale - free criterion 604 [ 77 ] , we set the power parameter β and computed the topological overlap measure ( TOM ) and 605 the corresponding dissimilarity matrices ( 1 – TOM ) . Genes were clustered by model - based 606 clustering of the dissimilarity matrix as implemented by Scrucca et al . 2016 [ 78 ] . Correlation 607 Page 26 of module eigengenes with disease state and between gene significance and module 608 membership were calculated by Pearson’s product - moment correlation as implemented in R 609 ( Langfelder et al , 2008 ; R Core Team , 2020 ) . We adjusted p - values for multiple testing with 610 the method described by Yekutieli & Benjamini , 2001 [ 79 ] . Genes with a gene significance 611 score above 0 . 3 , module membership above 0 . 7 , and intramodular connectivity that is larger 612 than the 8th percentile of all genes were identified as hubs . 613 Enrichment Analysis 614 Gene set enrichment analysis ( GSEA ) was conducted with the algorithm implemented in the 615 STRING database [ 28 ] for each dataset separately and results were combined by ranking 616 enriched terms after their enrichment scores and aggregation by RRA [ 74 ] . Gene ontology ( GO ) 617 and Reactome term enrichment of genes from different subnetworks were performed with the 618 algorithms implemented by the STRING database [ 28 ] in Cytoscape ( version 3 . 7 . 2 ) [ 80 ] . 619 Based on the pathway annotations in the KEGG database [ 81 ] and the protein - protein 620 interaction data from STRING ( version 11 . 0 ) [ 28 ] , we performed a network enrichment 621 analysis test ( NEAT ) [ 82 ] as implemented in the R package ´neat´ . Transcription factor 622 enrichment analysis ( TFEA ) was performed with ChIP - X Enrichment Analysis 3 ( CheA3 ) [ 83 ] 623 using the mean rank as the metric . Furthermore , we calculated the mean Z - ratios of transcription 624 factor targets with R - scripting language [ 84 ] and plotted the results using ggplot2 [ 85 ] . 625 Network analysis 626 Protein - protein interaction networks ( PPIN ) were retrieved from the STRING database [ 28 ] 627 using a confidence level cut - off of 0 . 4 and the Cytoscape software ( version 3 . 7 . 2 ) [ 80 ] . Top 50 628 hubs of the PPIN were computed with the cytoHubba plug - in [ 86 ] using the betweenness , 629 bottleneck , closeness , clustering coefficient , degree , DMNC , EcCentricity , EPC , MCC , 630 radiality and stress scoring methods . Results of different scoring methods were aggregated by 631 RRA [ 74 ] to increase the robustness of the prediction . For the network of genes altered in HD , 632 Page 27 AD , and PD only the top 10 ( protein - protein - interaction network ) hub proteins or top 20 633 ( coexpression network ) were used . We included hub proteins with an RRA score below 0 . 05 in 634 the further analysis and combined the lists of hubs in the co - expression network , identified by 635 WGNA , and the protein - protein interaction network by RRA [ 74 ] . 636 Comparison of differentially expressed genes in the brain of AD , PD , and HD patients 637 The list of differentially expressed genes in the brain of AD and PD patients was retrieved from 638 Kelly et al 2019 [ 37 ] and for HD all genes with an RRA score in the brain below 0 . 05 were used . 639 Networks and hub proteins / genes were computed as described above . 640 Confirmation of hub genes in HD mouse models 641 We analysed two datasets with transcriptomic data of HD mouse models to confirm if the 642 identified hub genes and transcriptional regulators were additionally altered in independent 643 datasets . In these studies , transcriptomic alterations in the striatum of R6 / 2 [ 42 ] ( NCBI 644 accession number : GSE113929 ) or YAC128 ( NCBI accession number : GSE19677 ) [ 43 ] were 645 analysed . Since Becanovic et al . 2010 used YAC128 mice at the age of 12 and 24 months , we 646 separated the samples according to the age of mice and analysed them as independent datasets . 647 Data tidying and computation of Z - ratios were performed as described in the sections “retrieval 648 and tiding of datasets” and “Robust rank aggregation analysis ( RRA ) ” . 649 Classification analysis of selected genes ( ACTR2 , ACTR3 , ARPC5 , CDC42 , CREB1 , DLX1 , 650 DNMT1 , DNMT3A , DNMT3B , HDAC2 , HDAC5 , HMGN3 , NFYA , NFYB , NFYC , PAK1 , 651 PRMT3 , VAMP2 , VAMP7 , YWHAH , ZDHHC13 , ZDHHC17 ) , identified in the human 652 datasets , was performed , as implemented in the R - package pROC [ 87 ] , to compute the area 653 under the curve ( AUC ) of the respective receiver - operator characteristics ( ROC ) . 95 % 654 confidence intervals of AUCs were calculated by bootstrapping with 10 , 000 replicates and 655 genes with confidence intervals for the AUC above 0 . 5 were considered capable to discriminate 656 between control and HD mice since the classification model is statistically significantly better 657 Page 28 than a random classification model . 658 Acknowledgements 659 We acknowledge funding of this work by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft ( DFG , 660 German Research Foundation – project number 412854449 ) .
