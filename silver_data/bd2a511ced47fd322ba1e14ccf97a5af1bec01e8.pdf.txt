Of particular interest is the mechanics of collagen - I gels , shown in Figure 1 ( a ) . These gels provide a relatively simple structure that can be nonin - vasively observed by confocal microscopy [ 3 , 4 ] and used as a scaffold for growing artiﬁcial tissues [ 5 ] and as a 3D environ - ment for studying cell motility [ 6 ] and tumor invasion [ 7 , 8 ] .

Other examples include actin , found in the cytoskeleton , and ﬁbrin , a component of blood clots . Com - mon mechanical features of biopolymers are negative nor - mal stresses under shear [ 9 ] , signiﬁcant contraction and alignment as the gel is axially stretched [ 10 , 11 ] , and strain stiffening by 2 – 3 orders of magnitude at large strains , as shown in Figure 1 ( f ) . The cause of this strain stiffening is not well understood . Storm et al . [ 12 ] attributed strain stiff - ening in all biopolymer networks exclusively to the pulling out of entropic modes of individual ﬁlaments . Their calcu - lation required the assumption that deformations are afﬁne . On the other hand , Heussinger et al . [ 13 , 14 ] showed how one could deconstruct the network deformation into a set of nonafﬁne ﬂoppy modes . They concluded that accounting for the nonafﬁnity was necessary in describing the elastic properties of the network . They hypothesize that the non - linearity comes from a transition from a bending regime to a stretching regime . Onck and coworkers [ 15 , 16 ] have pro - posed the alternative hypothesis that strain stiffening is due to the rearrangement of the ﬁbers as the network is strained . Resolving this debate has been difﬁcult as almost all theo - retical analysis has been on artiﬁcially generated networks in 2D . Whether such artiﬁcially generated networks can be used to accurately describe real biopolymer gels has not yet been conﬁrmed . In particular , key results of the above theories rest on assumptions on how the crosslink spacing scales with density . Although a direct relationship has been obtained in two dimensions for random stick networks [ 17 , 18 ] , in three dimensions , the scaling relationship will also depend on how thegelpolymerizes . Althoughthenatureofcollagenpolymer - ization is currently the subject of active research [ 19 ] , it is still not well understood . Moreover , the few examples of quanti - tative comparisons to experiment in the literature [ 12 , 20 , 21 ] arenotabletoquantitativelyﬁtthefullstress – strainresponse of the gel at varying densities using a single set of parameters . The goal of this research is to develop a model for colla - gen gel based on three - dimensional images of ﬂuorescently labeled collagen gels at different densities . The images are obtained by confocal microscopy [ Figure 1 ( a ) ] , and the net - work geometry is extracted using a custom FIbeR Extraction ( FIRE ) algorithm [ Figure 1 ( b ) ] [ 3 ] . The gel is modeled as a ran - dom network of crosslinked ﬁbers , as described below , and thestress – strainresponseiscomparedwiththatmeasuredby an AR - G2 rheometer . Good agreement between model and experiment is obtained by ﬁtting a single parameter , that is , the crosslink stiffness . 2 . EXPERIMENT The experiments were deﬁned in more detail previously [ 3 ] . Brieﬂy , we labeled bovine collagen type I with the ﬂuores - cent molecule TAMRA . Collagen solution at ﬁnal concentra - tions of 0 . 5 , 1 . 0 , and 1 . 5mg / mL were prepared , and a Leica SP5 resonant confocal microscope with a 63X 1 . 2 - NA water immersion objective was used to image the collagen sam - ples . Four networks at each density were extracted using the FIRE skeletonization algorithm [ 3 ] , as shown in Figure 1 ( b ) . After applying FIRE , the collagen density was re - estimated in two different ways : by counting the number of bright pixels in the image and by the product of the average ﬁber cross - sectionalarea ( A = 2800nm withanassumedradiusof30nm [ 3 , 22 ] ) and total ﬁber length in the extracted networks . The re - estimated densities of the three networks were 0 . 5 , 1 . 2 , and 1 . 4mg / mL . The ﬁnal step before simulation is to remove dangling portions of the network that do not contribute to its stiffness [ Figure 1 ( c ) ] .

Approximately 1 . 2mL of colla - gen solution was pipetted onto the 37 ◦ C preheated bottom plate of the rheometer , and the cone was lowered onto the sample . A solvent trap was used to prevent the sample from drying during the measurement . 3 . MODEL In the model for the collagen gel , each ﬁber is treated as an elastic beam that resists stretching and bending and each crosslink is treated as a torsional spring , making it more stiff than a freely rotating pin joint but less stiff than a welded joint of ﬁxed angle . The stretching modulus of an individual ﬁber is given by K s = EA , where E is theYoung’s modulus and A is the cross - sectional area . The Young’s modulus of a ﬁber in aqueous conditions has been estimated to be between 30 and 800MPa [ 23 – 25 ] , and we use a modulus of 50 MPa , which ﬁts the data well and is also close to the value chosen by Stylianopoulous and Barocas ( i . e . , 79MPa ) to ﬁt their model [ 21 ] . Ithasbeenshownthatasingleﬁberwillstiffenbyafactor of 2 – 4 when strained [ 25 ] . We choose here to use a constant E both to reduce the number of parameters in the model and to see if geometric reorientation of the network is enough to explainstrainstiffening . StylianopoulosandBarocas [ 21 ] also explored the bilinear and exponential constitutive relations for the individual ﬁbers and observed only minor effects on the macroscopic network behavior . The radius of each ﬁber is r = 30nm [ 3 , 22 ] . The bending modulus of the ﬁber is given by K b = EI = 32pN - μ m 2 , where I = π r 4 / 4 [ 26 ] . No crosslinking agent has been added to the gel , and very little is known about the nature of the naturally formed collagen crosslinks . We ﬁnd that we can ﬁt all the data by setting the torsional spring stiffness to K x = 300pN - μ m . To compare K b to K x , we consider K b / l c , where the mean crosslink spacing is given by l c ∼ 2 μ m [ 3 ] . Thus , we ﬁnd that K x ∼ 20 K b / l c . One possible reason for an increase in stiffness at the crosslinks could be an increase in ﬁber radius near the crosslinks by a factorof2 , asbendingstiffnessscalesby r 4 . However , much is still unknown about the internal structural of the ﬁbrils and the interﬁril and intraﬁbril bonding mechanics , and there - fore , there is necessarily no reason to expect K x and K b / l c to be equivalent . We assume that in the undeformed state of the network , there are no internal stresses . Thus , the ﬁbers have an innate curvature and the crosslinks have an equilibrium angle equal to that in their initial conﬁguration . We ignore entropic con - tributions to the ﬁber mechanics . While the geometric per - sistence length of these ﬁbers has been measured to be 20 μ m [ 3 ] , the thermal persistence length is much longer l p = K b / kT ∼ 1cm . Furthermore , in the case that the strain stiffening is dominated by thermal compliance , one would expect to see a decrease in the yield strain with increasing concentration [ 27 ] . Collagen gels , however , have been shown to have a constant yield strain of about 60 % for a wide range of concentrations [ 28 ] . The total energy in the network for a given conﬁguration is given below . U = N s (cid:2) i = 1 K s L i ( (cid:3) L i ) 2 2 + N b (cid:2) i = 1 K b L i (cid:3) (cid:3)θ i b (cid:4) 2 2 + N x (cid:2) k = 1 K x (cid:3) (cid:3)θ i x (cid:4) 2 2 ( 1 ) Here N a is the number of elements of type a ∈ { s , b , x } , which denotes stretching , bending , and crosslink , L i is the length of stretching element , θ i b and θ i x are the bending and crosslink angles , respectively , and (cid:3) indicates the difference between the deformed and undeformed state . To calculate the stress – strain relationship of our model network , we performed a series of 18 incremental strain steps by imposing a small deformation on one face , F 1 , while hold - ing the opposite face , F 0 , ﬁxed . We impose two types of deformations : tension [ Figure 1 ( d ) ] and shear [ Figure 1 ( e ) ] . In a tensile deformation , we allow the vertices on F 0 and F 1 to move freely in directions perpendicular to the imposed strain to allow for perpendicular contraction , which is seen to occur in these experiments [ 28 , 29 ] . In experiments of this type , the distancebetween F 0 and F 1 isontheorderofcentimeters , and thesimulatednetworkrepresentsasmallregionnearthecen - ter of a sample . In shear , we do not allow the boundary nodes on F 0 and F 1 to move freely . We compare the shear results to cone - plate rheometer experiments , where the shear faces are boundtotherheometer . Here , thedistancebetween F 0 and F 1 is 109 μ m , and the simulated network is one fourth the length of the experimental sample between the boundaries . In both deformations , all other nodes , including those on the four remaining faces of the network , are free to move . The mini - mum energy state of the network at an imposed strain U ( (cid:5) ij ) is found using a conjugate gradient method developed by HagerandZhang [ 30 ] . Thestressrequiredtoholdthenetwork in its current conﬁguration is given by σ ij ( (cid:5) ij ) = ( dU / d (cid:5) ij ) / A , where A denotes the area of F 0 . 4 . RESULTS The results are averaged over four extracted networks and over all six shear deformations (cid:5) ij | i (cid:5) = j in the sheared network and all three principal tensile directions (cid:5) ii in the stretched network . The stress – strain relationship for a single gel is shown in Figure 1 ( f ) , and the results for all gels are summa - r ized in Figure 2 . Below ∼ 5 % strain amplitude , the mater ial deforms primarily in an elastic fashion , but above ∼ 5 % , the material deforms irreversibly . Although the gel can recover some of its initial material properties given sufﬁcient time to relax , it never completely recovers . In Figure 3 ( a ) , we plot the small strain modulus from the samples by calculating the slope of the stress – strain curve at small strains ( 0 . 2 – 2 % ) . In Figure 3 ( b ) , we compare the previously reported tensile mod - ulus of large samples that are centimeters in length [ 28 ] to the simulation . Here , in both simulation and experiment , the largestrainmodulusiscomputedbyﬁttinglinestothestress – strain curve in the regime of 20 – 40 % strain .

( a ) Unscaled results . Note the good agreement between model and data at small and large strains . ( b ) When the curves are scaled by ρ 2 . 68 , relatively good data collapse is achieved . We denote lines of slope m = 1 and m = 3 to guide the eye . At large strains , scaling breaks down and the low - density curves overtake the high - density curves , because at large strains , stiffness scales linearly with density . Thus , this rescaling mainly serves as a visualization tool and does not represent a true data collapse . the stress – strain response is linear , as expected , and at larger shear strains , the stress – strain response stiffens considerably . In Figure 3 ( a ) , we show that the small strain modulus scales by σ 12 ∼ ρ 2 . 68 (cid:5) 12 , where ρ is the collagen density . At this time , it is not possible to verify the power law scaling in the model as only densities of 0 . 5 , 1 . 2 , and 1 . 4 were observed . The ﬂu - orescent labeling of the network changes the polymerization propertiesofthenetwork , causingittoclumpathigherdensi - ties . We use this scaling relationship to collapse the curves in Figure 2 ( b ) . The close agreement between model and exper - iment indicates that strain stiffening due to the geometric rearrangement of the collagen ﬁbers is enough to explain the strain stiffening seen in experiments . At large strains ( ∼ 50 % in tension and ∼ 200 % in shear ) , the stress – strain curve of the model becomes linear again , although with a much steeper slope . In Figure 3 ( b ) , we com - pare the large strain tensile behavior of the model to the experiments of Roeder et al . [ 28 ] . Although our model under - estimates their experimental measurement by a factor of 2 . 5 , we ﬁnd this to be reasonable as the two experiments used dif - ferent collagen protocols . In particular , different buffers were used . In Figure 2 , we also explore the case where K x = K b = 0 , such that we have only a network of springs connected at freely rotating pin joints . At low strains , the network can be deformed without exerting any stress , but at strains higher FIGURE 3 ( a ) The small strain shear modulus is compared with the cone – plate rheometer experiments , and a scaling law of G (cid:6) ∼ ρ 2 . 68 is observed for the experiment . ( b ) The large strain tensile modulus is from the model and from the experiments of Roeder et al . [ 28 ] . Results differ by a factor of 2 . 5 , which is reasonable as the two experimental protocols were different [ 28 ] . © 2010 Wiley Periodicals , Inc .

A topic of investigation explored by many is the validity of the assumption that these networks deform afﬁnely [ 14 , 15 ] . For brevity , we only state that the deformations are highly nonafﬁne at small strains where the majority of the energy is stored in bending rather than stretching . This is best seen in Figure 2 . Afﬁne deformations have the property that the majority of the energy stored in the network is in stretching the ﬁbers , but here , ﬁber stretching makes no contribution to the network stiffness until strains are greater than 10 % . In response to shear stress , the simulated networks also exhibited negative normal stresses that grow quadratically with strain ( Figure 4 ) , as observed in the experiments of Janmey et al . [ 9 ] . We also examined the perpendicular con - traction of the gel in response to axial strain in comparison with the experiments of Vader et al . [ 11 ] and Roeder et al . [ 4 ] , as shown in Figure 5 . The perpendicular strain was taken to be the perpendicular displacement divided by the origi - nal perpendicular distance from the origin averaged over all the nodes . Here , the model does not match the experiments well . In particular , in both experiments , the z - compression is signiﬁcantly greater than the y - compression . By contrast , in the simulation , the z - and y - compression are almost overlap - ping . Furthermore , both experiments exhibited considerably more perpendicular compression than seen in the simula - tion . One possible explanation is that the geometry of the experiments done here ( sheared cone - plate rheometer ) is considerably different from that in the other experiments ( stretched disk and stretched 3D I - beam ) . Another possi - bility is that the FIRE network extraction algorithm over - estimates the number of crosslinks of the network . It may also be that some of the crosslinks in the network slip , thus allowing the network to further compress in response to axial tension . To give the same strain - stiffening behavior , this would require stiffer crosslinks . Further exploration , how - ever , was beyond the scope of this article . Despite the lack of quantitative agreement , we note that nonlinearly increasing perpendicular strain is qualitatively similar to that observed inVader et al . [ 11 ] . 5 . SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION In summary , we have presented a microstructural model of a 3D biopolymer gel using a network geometry that is based on the true network architecture . It differs from pre - vious work in that we use realistic network architectures that have been extracted using the FIRE algorithm . We speciﬁ - cally focus on the mechanics of collagen - I networks , but we emphasize that this modeling approach is generalizable to other biopolymer networks . The model has three parame - ters : { E , r , K x } . The ﬁber radius and tensile modulus can be measured experimentally , and the model uses realistic para - meters . The crosslink torsional spring constant must be ﬁt to thedataandweused K x ∼ 20 K b / l c . Fittingthissingleparame - ter gives the right strain - stiffening behavior for networks at three different densities at strains that vary from 0 . 5 to 50 % . This result lends support to the hypothesis put forward by Onck et al . [ 15 ] that strain stiffening in polymer networks and particularly collagen - I gels is governed by rearrangement of the gel . Here , we note that the strain - stiffening mechanisms for collagen are likely different than for other gels . Because of itslongpersistencelength ( 1cm ) ﬁbers , theeffectsofentropic stiffening in these gels is known to be minimal . Therefore , the entropic stiffening hypothesis [ 31 ] is not applicable here . However , for other biopolymer gels such as actin , where the FIGURE 5 Perpendicularstrainsforthe1 . 2mg / mLgelinresponsetotensionwhen compared with the experiments from Vader et al . [ 11 ] and Roeder et al . [ 4 ] . 26 C O M P L E X I T Y © 2010 Wiley Periodicals , Inc . DOI 10 . 1002 / cplx J _ ID : za5 Customer A _ ID : 09 - 035 . R1 Cadmus Art : CPLX20332 — 2011 / 3 / 3 — page 27 — # 6 persistence length of the ﬁlaments is in the order of the mesh size , entropic stiffening of individual ﬁbers is more likely to be an important component that contributes to strain stiff - ening . The stiffening in ﬁbrin clots may depend not only on geometric rearrangements but also on the unfolding of the ﬁbrin protein [ 32 ] . Anotherﬁndingofthemodelisthatatshearstrainsgreater than 25 % , the stiffness of the gel is governed almost entirely by stretching of the ﬁbers . This result is relevant for collagen because cells embedded in these gels are seen to produce deformations of this order of magnitude [ 33 ] . In modeling large systems of this type where the strains are large , it may be sufﬁcient to treat each ﬁber as a spring rather than an elastic beam to reduce the computation time . This work also demonstrates that an understand of the crosslink mechanics in these systems is critical to understand their mechanical properties , as has been seen previously [ 34 ] . In much of the theoretical work that has been done on random stick net - works , the crosslinks are treated either as freely rotating pin joints or welded joints of ﬁxed angle [ 14 , 15 , 27 ] . Although these are sensible simplifying assumptions in develop - ing a theory , they are not adequate for describing actual networks . The mechanical properties of an individual ﬁber depends on the ﬁber microstructure and ranges from relatively linear elastic behavior even at large strains [ 24 ] to moderate stiffen - ing [ 35 ] . Here , wenotethatthesimulatedlargestrainmodulus underestimated the actual large strain modulus by a factor of two . This difference could potentially be explained by a stiff - eningoftheindividualﬁbersbyafactoroftwoatlargestrains , butconﬁrmationwouldrequireadditionalexperimentsmea - suringthestress – strainpropertiesofindividualﬁbersinthese collagen gels . We note that this model has been designed to capture the intermediate time scale behavior of the network ( minutes to hours ) , where the network behaves as an elastic solid . The viscous modulus is known to be a factor of 10 less than the elastic modulus within the range of 0 . 1 – 100Hz [ 36 , 37 ] , but at even faster time scales , the viscosity of the ﬂuid will play a critical role . At slower time scales , the assumption that the crosslinks remain relatively ﬁxed [ 36 ] breaks down as plastic deformation and creep occur . This simpliﬁed model provides astartingpointinthedevelopmentofamorecompletemodel of collagen gel . Ultimately , a more sophisticated approach , such as that taken by Rodney et al . [ 38 ] will be necessary to capture the full dynamic behavior of the gel , where crosslinks are allowed to slip and break . ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The authors thankV . Barocas , T . Stylianopoulos , E .
