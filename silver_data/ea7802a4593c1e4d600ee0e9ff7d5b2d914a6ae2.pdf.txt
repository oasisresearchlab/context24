SUMMARY Genetic co - depletion of the actin - severing proteins ADF and CFL1 triggers catastrophic loss of adult homeostasis in multiple tissues . There is impaired cell - cell adhesion in skin keratinocytes with dysregu - lation of E - cadherin , hyperproliferation of differenti - ated cells , and ultimately apoptosis . Mechanistically , the primary consequence of depleting both ADF and CFL1 is uncontrolled accumulation of contractile actin stress ﬁbers associated with enlarged focal adhesions at the plasma membrane , as well as reduced rates of membrane protrusions . This gener - ates increased intracellular acto - myosin tension that promotes nuclear deformation and physical disruption of the nuclear lamina via the LINC complex that normally connects regulated actin ﬁlaments to the nuclear envelope . We therefore describe a pathway involving the actin - severing proteins ADF and CFL1 in regulating the dynamic turnover of con - tractile actin stress ﬁbers , and this is vital to prevent the nucleus from being damaged by actin contrac - tility , in turn preserving cell survival and tissue homeostasis . INTRODUCTION The coﬁlin family of actin depolymerizing factor proteins controls actin dynamics by severing and depolymerizing actin ﬁlaments ( reviewed in Mizuno , 2013 ) . There are three highly conserved co - ﬁlins ( between 70 % and 81 % identical at the amino acid level ) ; these are Coﬁlin - 1 ( CFL1 ; also known as non - muscle - or n - Coﬁ - lin ) , ADF ( stands for actin - depolymerizing factor ; also known as Destrin ) , and Coﬁlin - 2 ( CFL2 ; also known as muscle - or m - Coﬁ - lin ) . These have distinct but overlapping expression patterns and are considered to have similar biochemical functions ; they bind actin monomers and ﬁlaments ( G - actin and F - actin , respectively ; Lappalainen and Drubin , 1997 ) . Their activities increase the num - ber of actin monomers and ﬁlament fragments , so permitting ﬁla - ment turnover and treadmilling at key locations in migrating cells ( reviewed in Bugyi and Carlier , 2010 ) . Despite a huge literature on the role of coﬁlin ( s ) in actin tread - milling and cell migration in vitro and in the behavior of cancer cells associated with invasion ( DesMarais et al . , 2005 ; Wang et al . , 2007 ) , genetic co - deletion of both actin - severing coﬁlins in adult tissues has not been carried out to address what are their fundamental roles in overall cellular actin regulation and the con - sequences for cell and tissue homeostasis . Data to date imply that ADF and CFL1 likely have some distinct and some overlap - ping functions in vivo . CFL1 - deﬁcient mice are not viable , dying at E11 . 5 – 12 . 5 due to aberrant neural tube closure and defective neural crest cell migration ( Gurniak et al . , 2005 ) . ADF is therefore unable to compensate for loss of CFL1 during embryonic devel - opment , although it is highly expressed in the cranial neuroecto - derm ( Gurniak et al . , 2005 ) . ADF - deﬁcient mice are viable , with normal brain appearance , but suffer from corneal defects in adult mice that cause blindness ( Bellenchi et al . , 2007 ; Ikeda et al . , 2003 ) . Conditional loss of CFL1 in neuronal cells causes over - dif - ferentiation , altered proliferation , and migration that are linked to a lissencephaly phenotype ( Bellenchi et al . , 2007 ) . In ureteric bud , loss of function of both CFL1 and ADF arrests branching morphogenesis , implying functional redundancy in this context ( Kuure et al . , 2010 ) . Here , we address the fundamental roles of ADF and CFL1 , the most - potent actin - severing coﬁlins ( Vartiainen et al . , 2002 ) , in adult cells and tissues , demonstrating dynamic stress ﬁber regu - lation required for maintenance of nuclear shape and integrity , cell survival , and adult tissue homeostasis . Depletion of ADF and CFL1 triggered accumulation of aberrant , contractile actin ﬁbers that increased intracellular tension , leading to actin - dependent nuclear deformation via the LINC complex that connects the actin cytoskeleton to the nuclear lamina . Thus , redundant roles of ADF and CFL1 include to dynamically control tensile actin stress ﬁbers and focal adhesions , and this is vital for maintenance of nuclear shape , nuclear integrity , and cell and tissue viability .

K14CreER T2 , K14CreER T2 / ADF (cid:1) / (cid:1) / CFL1 WT / WT , K14CreER T2 / ADF WT / WT / CFL1 ﬂ / ﬂ , and K14CreER T2 / ADF (cid:1) / (cid:1) / CFL1 ﬂ / ﬂ mice were treated with tamoxifen ( 4 - OHT ) , as we have described previously ( McLean et al . , 2001 ) . This permitted us to examine the effects of deleting one or both ADF and CFL1 isoforms from cells in the epidermis of adult mice . We found that skin from K14CreER T2 mice expressed both ADF and CFL1 ( referred to hereafter as ADF + / + CFL1 + / + ) , whereas skin from K14CreER T2 / ADF (cid:1) / (cid:1) / CFL1 WT / WT mice was completely deﬁcient in ADF ( referred to as ADF (cid:1) / (cid:1) CFL1 + / + ; Fig - ure S1A ) . 4 - OHT - treated skin from K14CreER T2 / ADF WT / WT / CFL1 ﬂ / ﬂ mice expressed ADF but greatly reduced CFL1 ( referred to as ADF + / + CFL1 (cid:1) / (cid:1) ) , whereas 4 - OHT - K14CreER T2 / ADF (cid:1) / (cid:1) / CFL1 ﬂ / ﬂ mice expressed no detectable ADF and little CFL1 ( referred to as ADF (cid:1) / (cid:1) CFL1 (cid:1) / (cid:1) ; Figures 1 and S1A ) . Interest - ingly , CFL2 was present in all mice irrespective of genotype , but its expression in the skin was apparently unaltered by the loss of ADF and / or CFL1 ( Figure S1A ) . Upon staining skin sections with H & E , we observed that ADF (cid:1) / (cid:1) CFL1 + / + or ADF + / + CFL1 (cid:1) / (cid:1) skin appeared normal and similar to wild - type ( WT ) ADF + / + CFL1 + / + skin ( Figure 1A ) . How - ever , when both ADF and CFL1 isoforms were depleted in ADF (cid:1) / (cid:1) CFL1 (cid:1) / (cid:1) skin , there was a striking thickening of the epidermis and an apparent accumulation of cells at day 5 following treatment with 4 - OHT ( Figure 1A ) . Expression of CFL2 was apparently unable to compensate for loss of ADF and CFL1 , indicating that only the redundant functions of ADF and CFL1 regulate normal skin homeostasis . We presume this is a function of actin severing , because CFL2 has much - weaker actin - severing activity ( Vartiainen et al . , 2002 ) . To characterize the reasons for thickening of the epidermis , we ﬁrst determined whether depletion of ADF / CFL1 affected cell proliferation . K14CreER T2 and K14CreER T2 / ADF (cid:1) / (cid:1) / CFL1 ﬂ / ﬂ mice were treated for 2 or 4 days with 4 - OHT and labeled with BrdU 2 hr prior to harvesting of skin . In the absence of ADF and CFL1 , we observed a signiﬁcant increase in the number of keratinocytes actively replicating their genomes compared to their WT counterparts . The number of proliferating epidermal cells increased to a maximum irrespective of whether 4 - OHT was administered for 2 or 4 days , implying that the conse - quences of Cre - induced CFL1 excision from the mouse epidermis was a rapid effect ( Figure 1B ) . To establish whether this phenotype was recapitulated in other tissues , we also deleted ADF and CFL1 within the hepato - cytes of the adult liver using an Ah - Cre transgene . Following a single injection of the cytochrome p450 inducer b - napthoﬂa - vone , Cre is induced in approximately 90 % of hepatocytes ( Reed et al . , 2008 ) . By 9 days after gene deletion , these mice developed very obvious hepatomegaly that was associated with increased BrdU and Ki67 staining ( Figures S2A – S2C ) , and the mice had to be sacriﬁced . We next addressed whether there was a difference in the morphology of the epithelial cells present in the ADF / CFL1 knockout mice . Using immunoﬂuorescence ( IF ) , we observed that ADF + / + CFL1 + / + skin cells had a typical epithelial morphology with E - cadherin clearly visible in cell - cell contacts ( Figure 1C ) . However , E - cadherin was barely visible at cell - cell adhesions of doubly depleted ADF (cid:1) / (cid:1) CFL1 (cid:1) / (cid:1) skin ( Figure 1C ) . In the presence of ADF and CFL1 , primary cultures of keratino - cytes also have visible cell - cell contacts , whereas keratinocytes isolated from double ADF / CFL1 knockout skin display reduced membrane E - cadherin staining ( Figure 1D ) and exhibit a more - mesenchymal - like , elongated , and ﬂattened morphology ( see later in Figure 2A ) . These data support a critical role of ADF / CFL1 in cell morphology and epithelial tissue organization . To further examine the expanded cell population after ADF / CFL1 loss , we stained skin sections with markers of differentia - tion . Both keratin ( K ) 14 and K10 were expressed throughout the thickened epidermis ( Figure 1E ) , indicating that hyperprolifera - tion and differentiation occurred concomitantly in the absence of ADF and CFL1 . K6 is a marker of ‘‘active keratinocytes’’ that are proliferating , migratory cells identiﬁed in wound healing and other pathological conditions ( Freedberg et al . , 2001 ) . We found that K6 expression was increased throughout the thickened epidermis upon ADF / CFL1 co - depletion ( Figure 1F ) , implying that there was aberrant induction of the keratinocyte activation cycle normally associated with inﬂammatory and / or wound repair signaling . Loss of ADF and CFL1 also resulted in increased expression of the cleaved form of caspase - 3 in vivo , indicating a high spontaneous level of apoptosis ( Figure 1G ) . Taken together , these data demonstrate that overlapping Figure 1 .

It is actually required to prevent inappropriate spontaneous entry of cells into the cell cycle , resulting in hyperproliferation of activated and differentiated ker - atinocytes and apoptosis . Indeed , loss of the actin - severing functions carried out by ADF and CFL1 result in tissue break - down , loss of barrier function , infection , and death ( see mouse pathology later in Figure S7 ) . Loss of ADF / CFL1 Leads to Actin Filament Accumulation We next addressed how the actin cytoskeleton was visibly per - turbed in ADF (cid:1) / (cid:1) CFL1 (cid:1) / (cid:1) skin keratinocytes that displayed a more - mesenchymal - like , elongated , and ﬂattened morphology compared to their WT ( ADF + / + CFL1 + / + ) counterparts that have an epithelial morphology and grow in more - compact colonies ( Figure 2A ) . When the ADF / CFL1 - depleted cells were stained with phalloidin , we saw a huge increase in F - actin , in a form that appeared akin to stress ﬁbers that are not typically abundant in epithelial cells . This was in stark contrast to WT keratinocytes , which displayed predominantly cortical actin ( Figure 2A ) . Because keratinocytes have a ﬁnite lifespan in culture , we therefore generated H - Ras - dependent malignant keratinocytes ( squamous cell carcinoma [ SCC ] cells ) after two - stage chemical carcinogenesis using DMBA / TPA ( McLean et al . , 2001 ; Quinta - nilla et al . , 1986 ) . We used ADF (cid:1) / (cid:1) CFL1 + / + mice to generate SCCs ( hereafter ADF - null SCCs ) and knocked down CFL1 using siRNAs to generate SCC cells that were doubly depleted for ADF and CFL1 . Speciﬁcally , pools of four siRNAs , as well as two indi - vidual siRNAs , were used , with the latter targeting either the cod - ing region ( siCFL1 CR ) or the UTR ( siCFL1 UTR ) of CFL1 mRNA to control for off - target effects . The degree of CFL1 knockdown was excellent ( R 99 % at the protein and mRNA level ; Figure S1B and data not shown , respectively ) . When ADF - null SCCs were depleted of CFL1 ( siCFL1 ) , the cells displayed altered morphology at 36 – 40 hr post - siRNA treat - ment , acquiring a ﬂattened and more - spread phenotype with protrusions ( Figure 2B ) . Similar to the ADF (cid:1) / (cid:1) CFL1 (cid:1) / (cid:1) keratino - cytes , when these cancer cells were stained with phalloidin , we observed a huge increase in F - actin in the form of cytoplasmic stress ﬁbers in all the depleted cells ( Figure 2D ) . This was observed in four different ADF - null SCC lines derived from sepa - rate animals , as well as with WT SCC cell lines co - transfected with siRNAs for both ADF and CFL1 ( not shown ) . Enforced expression of WT CFL1 via retroviral infection of ADF - null SCCs ( Figures S1C and S1D ) prevented the accumulation of F - actin bundles and restored normal cell morphology when the endogenous protein was depleted by UTR - targeted siRNAs ( Figure 2C ) . Comparing the relative transcription levels of ADF / coﬁlin family members in WT SCC cells , we found that CFL1 is the predominant isoform , with a 7 - to 8 - fold increase over ADF and (cid:3) 35 - fold increase over CFL2 . ADF and CFL2 differed by (cid:3) 4 . 5 - fold ( Figure S1E ) . Whereas we could restore cell morphology by modest re - expression of exogenous CFL1 , we also found that enforced overexpression of CFL2 could also partially restore cell morphology and suppress F - actin accumu - lation upon ADF / CFL1 depletion ( Figures S1F – S1H and S1J ) . Because coﬁlins have reported roles in cell migration , mem - brane protrusions , and lamelipodia dynamics , we next ad - dressed whether ADF - and CFL1 - depleted SCCs were still able to generate dynamic peripheral membrane structures . We found that over a 30 - min period , siCFL1 - treated ADF - null SCCs retained the ability to generate dynamic membrane protru - sions ( some in the form of blebs ) , although these were less frequent , more persistent , and less dynamic ( see Figure 2E , representative kymographs and kymograph proﬁles in Figures 2F and 2G , and quantiﬁcations in Figures 2H – 2J ; the montage in Figure 2E was generated from Movies S1 and S2 ) . Taken together , our data demonstrate an unequivocal role for ADF and CFL1 in the dynamic regulation of actin stress ﬁbers in normal and malignant keratinocytes , ensuring that they are turned over and not assembled / stabilized in an uncontrolled manner . Membrane structures can still be generated in the absence of ADF and CFL1 , but these are less dynamic . Loss of ADF and CFL1 Increases Free Actin Barbed Ends , Stress Fibers , and Enlarged Focal Adhesions The accumulation of stable cytoplasmic ﬁlaments prompted us to examine G - / F - actin ratios in doubly ADF / CFL1 - depleted cells . We performed a two - step lysis involving phalloidin - medi - ated F - actin stabilization and observed a large increase in F - compared to G - actin ( Figure 3A ) . In addition , the ADF / CFL1 - depletedSCCsexhibitedan (cid:3) 7 - to8 - foldincreaseinfree - barbed ends , indicative of increased actin polymerization ( Figure 3B ; quantiﬁed in Figure 3C ) . Anti - phospho - paxillin and anti - vinculin IF showed that ADF / CFL1 - depleted SCCs had a greater number of larger , more brightly stained adhesions and that many of the ( C ) ADF - null SCCs expressing empty vector ( pWZL ) or exogenously expressed CFL1 ( pWZL + CFL1 wt ) were treated with siNT or siRNAs targeting the UTR ( siCFL1 UTR ) of CFL1 mRNA .

We also examined whether the ﬁbers accumulated upon ADF / CFL1 co - depletion are crosslinked . Staining for both a - actinin and b - actin revealed co - localization between the two proteins , indi - cating that the ﬁlaments are bundled ( Figure 3J ) . Actin Filament Accumulation Causes Loss of Nuclear Shape and Integrity Our data imply that the elongated ﬂattened morphology of the ADF / CFL1 - depleted cells was the result of massive unrestrained accumulation of bundled actin ﬁlaments . We also observed pro - found nuclear deformation in both untransformed ADF (cid:1) / (cid:1) CFL1 (cid:1) / (cid:1) keratinocytes and in ADF / CFL1 - depleted SCC cells . Nuclei were either pushed into the bulk space available in be - tween actin ﬁbers or were compressed to cause loss of nuclear integrity via disruption of the nuclear envelope as judged by staining of Lamins A / C ( see Figures 3D and 4A ) . A three - dimen - sional model compiled from z stacks of nuclear and F - actin - stained ADF / CFL1 - depleted SCCs revealed that unrestrained actin ﬁlaments extend into , and through , nuclear space ( Fig - ure 4B ) . By contrast , the major actin ﬁlaments are around the cell periphery , with no nuclear encroachment , in ADF - null SCCs treated with non - targeting siRNAs ( siNT ) ( Figure 4B ) . The same conclusions held true when cells were imaged with struc - tured illumination microscopy ( SIM ) that permitted enhanced visualization of the relationship between actin ﬁlaments and thenuclearenvelope , visualized byLaminA / Cstaining ( Figure 4C and z stack in Figure S3A ) . Totestwhethertheunregulatedactinﬁlamentswerealsoasso - ciated with nuclear shape changes in vivo , ADF (cid:1) / (cid:1) CFL1 (cid:1) / (cid:1) and control ADF + / + CFL1 + / + mouse skins were stained for b - actin and Lamin A / C . Cells throughout the thickened epidermis in double ADF / CFL1 knockout mice contained vastly increased numbers of cytoplasmic actin ﬁlaments that were not visible in control mice and deformation of nuclear shape with disruption of nuclear Lamin A / C and DAPI staining ( Figure 4D ) . Some nuclei were frag - mented and showed a jumbled arrangement within the mutant tissue . There was general enlargement ( karyomegaly ; Figure 4E ) , suggestive of cellular stress ( Chow et al . , 2012 ) , and there was breakdown of tissue architecture . A corresponding increase in cytoplasmic ﬁlamentous actin and aberrant nuclear morphology were also apparent when ADF and CFL1 were depleted in hepa - tocytes of the adult liver ( Figure S3B ) . Taken together , our results sofarsuggestedthataccumulationofactinstressﬁberstriggered by ADF / CFL1 loss may physically promote deformation of the nuclear lamina—a hypothesis we test below . We next interfered with known actin ﬁlament regulators . The major mechanisms by which actin ﬁlaments are generated within cells are 3 - fold : spontaneous actin nucleation and elongation that depends on the actin monomers concentration ; branched nucleation by the Arp2 / 3 complex ; and , lastly , nucleation and elongation mediated by formins ( reviewed in Pollard and Cooper , 2009 ) . Therefore , we depleted Arp3 and the two major diapha - nous - related formins mDia1 and mDia2 ( siRNA - mediated knock - down is shown in Figures S4A and S4B ) . Although there were some mild morphological effects upon depleting mDia1 or mDia2 when compared to control ADF - null SCCs ( Figure 5A ) , there was no rescue of the changes in ﬂattened elongated cell morphology , actin stress ﬁber accumulation , or nuclear defor - mation phenotypes caused by ADF / CFL1 co - depletion ( Figures 5A – 5D ) . In contrast , knockdown of Arp3 caused reversion of the large ﬂattened morphology , stress ﬁber production , and nu - clear deformation ( Figures 5A – 5D ) . Although this effect of Arp3 depletion may not be direct , it visibly inhibits the extensive F - actin accumulation and nuclear deformation that results from ADF / CFL1 loss ( Figures 5C and 5D ) . In keeping with the siRNA - mediated knockdown experiments , the Arp2 / 3 inhibitor ( CK869 ; Nolen et al . , 2009 ) gave rise to a dose - dependent inhibition of F - actin that accumulated after ADF / CFL1 loss ( Figures S4C and S4E ) , whereas the general ‘‘small - molecule inhibitor of formin homology 2 domain’’ ( SMIFH2 ) ( Rizvi et al . , 2009 ) did not inhibit F - actin accumulation ( Figures S4D and S4F ) . We also considered whether SRF / MAL transcriptional activ - ity , which is known to be enhanced when G - actin concentration is low ( reviewed in Olson and Nordheim , 2010 ; Sotiropoulos et al . , 1999 ; Vartiainen et al . , 2007 ) , contributed to the observed phenotypes , because a subset of genes regulated by their activity ( including actin itself ) was upregulated in ADF / CFL1 - depleted cells ( not shown ) . Therefore , we depleted SRF by RNAi in order to indirectly modulate actin accumulation in doubly ADF / CFL1 - depleted cells ( Figure S5A ) . We found that SRF depletion signiﬁcantly restored a more - normal morphology and suppressed aberrant actin ﬁlament accumulation upon ADF / CFL1 depletion ( Figures 5A , 5B , 5E , and S5B ) . This implied that SRF - mediated transcription was required to fuel the enhanced actin stress ﬁber assembly in the absence of coﬁlin - mediated dynamic actin ﬁlament turnover . Impor - tantly , SRF depletion also signiﬁcantly restored the number of non - fragmented nuclei ( Figure 5C ) , providing supporting evi - dence that it is the over - assembly and stabilization of actin stress ﬁbers upon loss of the ﬁlament - severing proteins ADF and CFL1 that causes nuclear deformation . Severalfold overex - pression of CFL2 also led to reduction of F - actin accumulation as noted above , which , in turn , could signiﬁcantly restore nu - clear shape and lamina integrity after ADF / CFL1 loss ( Figures S1H – S1J ) .

Control cells displayed only peripheral staining of phosphorylated ( Ser19 ) myosin light chain ( pMLC ) that was coin - cident with cortical actin ﬁlaments , whereas the actin bundles crossing the intracellular space stained heavily for pMLC in the ADF / CFL1 - depleted cells ( Figure 6A ) . This implied that the induced actin ﬁlaments were contractile , resulting in increased intracellular tension in the absence of ADF / CFL1 . We next used inhibitors of both Rho - associated protein kinase ( ROCK ; Y27632 ) and myosin II activity ( Blebbistatin ) ( Kova´cs et al . , 2004 ; Straight et al . , 2003 ; Uehata et al . , 1997 ) . There was some retraction of cell bodies when these inhibitors were used in control siNT - treated cells , with the appearance of some thin membrane protrusions ( Figure 6B ) . However , when Blebbistatin was used in ADF / CFL1 co - depleted cells , there was partial restoration of normal cell morphology ( Figure 6B ) , suppression of stress ﬁber accumulation ( Figure 6B ) , and rescue of the nuclear deformation phenotype as judged by a signiﬁ - cantly increased number of non - fragmented nuclei ( Figure 6C ) . In contrast , the ROCK inhibitor Y27632 did not rescue the nu - clear deformation phenotype . We also found that Myosin IIA , the main non - muscle myosin isoform expressed in SCCs ( data not shown ) , decorates the ﬁlaments induced upon ADF / CFL1 loss ( Figure 6D ) . siRNA - mediated depletion of Myosin IIA efﬁ - ciently prevented actin accumulation and rescued nuclear frag - mentation after ADF / CFL1 co - depletion ( Figures 6E – 6G ) . Nuclear Deformation Requires the LINC Complex We next addressed whether the physical damage to the nucleus caused by the accumulated contractile stress ﬁbers involved the linker of cytoskeleton to nucleoskeleton ( LINC ) complex , which provides a physical link between the actin cytoskeleton and nu - clear lamina ( Crisp et al . , 2006 ; Zhen et al . , 2002 ; reviewed in Starr and Fridolfsson , 2010 ) . Therefore , we depleted two of the components of the LINC complex , namely Nesprin - 2 giant ( here - after Nesprin - 2G ; also known as Syne - 2 ) and SUN1 ( Figure 7 ) . Disruption of the LINC complex is known to affect nuclear shape in epidermal cells ( L € uke et al . , 2008 ) , and this was the case when Nesprin - 2G was depleted in control cells ( siNT ; Figure 7A , ar - rows in top right panels ; see Figure 7B for knockdown efﬁciency [ determined by qRT - PCR in this case , as we did not have a reli - able antibody ] ) . However , when Nesprin - 2G was knocked down in ADF / CFL1 - depleted cells , nuclear shape was restored and was similar to Nesprin - 2G knockdown in control cells ( compare lower right to upper right panels in Figure 7A ) . Nesprin - 2G - depleted cells exhibited a less - ﬂattened morphology with slightly enlarged nuclei visibly projecting away from the cell surface ( Fig - ure 7C ) and reduced nuclear deformation ( Figure 7D ) . Upon co - staining of the nuclear envelope and F - actin ( see Figure 7A , lower panels ) , we observed an ‘‘actin gap’’ that formed around the nucleus when Nesprin - 2G was knocked down in ADF / CFL1 co - depleted cells . When we quantiﬁed this actin gap , i . e . space around the nucleus representing the distance between the nu - clear envelope and the closest actin ﬁlaments , we found a signif - icant increase upon Nesprin - 2G knockdown , without overall cellular ﬁlamentous actin levels being signiﬁcantly altered ( Fig - ures 7E and 7F ) . This likely reﬂects uncoupling of the accumu - lated actin ﬁlaments from the nuclear envelope caused by disruption of the LINC complex . In such a scenario , the nucleus would be freed from the increased tension and excessive force produced by the contractile actin stress ﬁbers linking to the nu - cleus via the LINC complex upon loss of both ADF and CFL1 , so preventing nuclear deformation . Similar effects and rescue of nuclear fragmentation was observed upon SUN1 co - depletion ( Figures 7G – 7I ) , indicating that the mechanism by which the un - controlled actin stress ﬁbers damage the nuclear lamina involves engagement with the LINC complex . ADF / CFL1 Depletion Ultimately Leads to DNA Damage and Cell Death Because the ultimate consequence of these events was loss of cell viability in vivo ( Figures 1G and S7 ) , we investigated the fate of cells depleted of ADF / CFL1 in vitro . Proliferation halted 24 hr after siCFL1 treatment , and almost the entire cell popula - tion shifted to a sub - G1 peak by 72 hr when compared to the siNT control ( Figure S6A ) , indicative of massive apoptosis . We found that several apoptosis markers , including cleaved cas - pases and lamin A , were elevated by 48 hr , which paralleled the timing of complete loss of CFL1 in ADF - null SCCs ( Fig - ure S6B ) . Moreover , Plk - 1 and full - length PARP levels were decreased by 72 hr , indicative of cell cycle exit and apoptosis , respectively . There was also evidence of a DNA damage response ( g H2AX blot in Figure S6B ) , backed up by staining of cells and skin for the double - strand break marker g H2AX ( Fig - ures S6C – S6E ) . We note that the LINC complex is known to be associated directly or indirectly with chromatin , through binding to nuclear lamina . Therefore , it is intriguing to speculate that the nuclear deformation we describe upon ADF / CFL1 co - depletion may be directly linked to DNA damage ; however , we have not been able to discriminate between damage caused due to nu - clear membrane deformation / rupture or as a result of induction ( B ) 3D model construction composed of nuclei ( blue ) and F - actin ( red ) of cells treated as in ( A ) .

Adult mouse liver depleted for ADF and CFL1 also exhibited evidence of massive accumulation of F - actin and associated DNA damage , with a signiﬁcant proportion of hepa - tocytes staining positively for g H2AX ( Figures S6F and S6G ) . To understand the long - term consequences of deleting the genes encoding ADF and CFL1 for the animal , samples from the organs of sacriﬁced ADF (cid:1) / (cid:1) CFL1 (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice 4 days after treatment with 4 - OHT were taken for pathological examination . Major le - sions were found in the skin , conjunctiva , cornea , and oral mu - cosa . Pronounced histological changes were noted , with diffuse thickeningoftheepidermisduetohyperplasiaofthespinouslayer of cells , which had enlarged misshapen and disorganized nuclei ( Figure S7A , upper left panel , solid arrow ) . Within both the under - lying basal and spinous cell layers , numerous apoptotic cells with condensation , hypereosinophilia , and nuclear pyknosis were evident ( Figure S7A , upper right panel ) . Histological changes were also evident in the cornea , which displayed acute keratitis with diffuse stromal edema , neutrophil inﬁltrates , misshapen nuclei , and apoptosis of superﬁcial stratiﬁed epithelial cells and frank ulceration ( Figure S7B , solid arrow ) . Finally , similar changes were evident in the buccal and lingual mucosae in the oral cavity ( Figure S7C ) . This demonstrates that severe disruption of tissue homeostasis is evident upon pathological examination , and this is associatedwith perturbed nuclear shape and apoptosis in vivo . DISCUSSION Double deletion of ADF and CFL1 in keratinocytes and hepato - cytes in vivo had the profound effects we describe , induced as soon as could be determined after ADF / CFL1 were co - depleted , highlighting their direct importance in cellular health and tissue homeostasis . Essentially , ADF and CFL1 are required to ( 1 ) pre - vent inappropriate spontaneous proliferation of keratinocytes that express differentiation markers , ( 2 ) maintain cell - cell con - tacts and membrane E - cadherin , ( 3 ) suppress keratinocyte ‘‘activation , ’’ ( 4 ) prevent over - accumulation of contractile actin stress ﬁbers and associated focal adhesions , and ( 5 ) prevent nu - clear deformation and ultimately apoptosis / DNA damage . The hyperproliferative phenotype may be a consequence of loss of cell - cell contacts that has previously been linked to release from a non - proliferating state ( Charest et al . , 2009 ; Owens et al . , 2000 ) . Mechanical force , derived from the dramatic over - production of contractile actin stress ﬁbers , may also contribute . One possibility we are investigating is the role of YAP / TAZ signaling in keratinocyte hyperproliferation , as this is controlled by actin - regulatory proteins , including CFL1 , and mechanically induced proliferation ( Aragona et al . , 2013 ) , and we have found that YAP / TAZ target genes are increased in doubly ADF - and CFL1 - depleted SCC cells ( not shown ) . Keratinocyte activation and differentiation are known to be inﬂuenced by cell shape changes . For example , actin networks have been linked to keratinocyte differentiation via elevated SRF / MAL signaling ( Connelly et al . , 2010 ) . We found that double depletion of ADF and CFL1 in SCC cells promoted expression of SRF / MAL transcriptional targets ( not shown ) , including a pre - dominance of cytoskeletal , cell adhesion , and actin regulatory molecules ( Olson and Nordheim , 2010 ) , and that SRF knock - down led to decreased actin accumulation and signiﬁcant rescue of nuclear deformation . This implied that lack of actin severing , via depletion of ADF / CFL1 , promoted unrestrained incorporation of G - actin into actin ﬁlaments ( F - actin ) , which , in turn , led to a very low G - : F - actin ratio . As a result , compensatory SRF / MAL transcriptional activity was triggered , as has been described by others ( Miralles et al . , 2003 ; Sotiropoulos et al . , 1999 ) , fueling the production of even more actin ﬁlaments that contributes to the severe consequences observed . Live - cell imaging established that peripheral membrane pro - trusions , in the SCC cells examined , were able to form but that their persistence and dynamics were inﬂuenced by loss of ADF and CFL1 . This is in line with reports showing that CFL1 mediates treadmilling activities that primarily control sub - cortical dendritic actin networks , promoting membrane protrusion and lamellipo - dia upon receipt of appropriate stimuli ( Bravo - Cordero et al . , 2013 ; Delorme et al . , 2007 ; Ghosh et al . , 2004 ; Mouneimne et al . , 2006 ; Pollard and Borisy , 2003 ) . Unexpectedly , our data indicate that one important and redundant role of the actin - ﬁlament - severing functions of ADF and CFL1 is to turnover cytoplasmic contractile actin stress ﬁbers , so promoting their dynamic regulation , keeping them under tight control . The severing activity of coﬁlin ( s ) is concentration dependent ( Andria - nantoandro and Pollard , 2006 ) , and CFL2 , which has much - weaker actin - severing activity than ADF and CFL1 ( Vartiainen et al . , 2002 ) , cannot compensate for loss of ADF and CFL1 in skin ( or liver ) or SCCs at endogenous levels and its expression is not altered upon ADF / CFL1 loss . However , when overex - pressed several fold in cancer cells , it is able to prevent aberrant actin ﬁber formation and nuclear deformation to some extent . Hence , it is likely that the difference in severing ability between CFL1 and CFL2 explains the lack of compensation in dynami - cally regulating actin stress ﬁbers . The unrestrained accumulation of contractile stress ﬁbers in keratinocytes had unrecoverable consequences for viability . There was profound nuclear deformation and disruption to the nuclear membrane , leading to apoptosis and DNA damage in vitro and in vivo . In some cases , this led to leakage of nuclear material , including the transcription factors c - Myc and SRF ( not shown ) .

Whereas Arp2 / 3’s role in the unre - strained actin stress ﬁber accumulation may be via indirect ef - fects on cytoskeletal networks , the fact that nuclear deformation is also rescued when Arp3 is depleted implies that the aberrant actin ﬁlaments are likely responsible . Whereas the inability of knockdown of mDia1 or mDia2 to suppress actin ﬁber accumu - lation , or the use of the SMIFH2 inhibitor , do not exclude the pos - sibility that other formins may play a role in the stress ﬁber accu - mulation , the lack of effect on aberrant stress ﬁbers correlated with lack of any effect on nuclear deformation . It was the case that aberrant accumulation of actin stress ﬁbers was always associated with nuclear deformation and disruption of the nu - clear lamina . The uncontrolled bundled actin ﬁlaments promoted by ADF / CFL1 depletion were decorated with pMLC , implying their con - tractile nature , and we note that a direct role of ADF and CFL1 in regulating intracellular contractility in human cells has been proposed ( Wiggan et al . , 2012 ) . Coﬁlins are thought to compete with myosin for binding to actin ﬁlaments , thereby inhibiting excessive contractility and force generation inside cells . There - fore , the absence of ADF / CFL1 could lead to unrestricted myosin binding to the new ﬁlaments that exert excessive contractile force this way . We established that contractility was causally linked to the extensive nuclear deformation observed upon ADF / CFL1 co - depletion , because inhibition of myosin activity by Blebbistatin or Myosin - IIA knockdown efﬁciently inhibited actin stress ﬁber accumulation and the nuclear deformation they cause . One way that cells can regulate their nuclear shape is via an actin cap—a subset of contractile actin ﬁlaments passing over the nucleus and terminating in distinct actin - cap - associated focal adhesions ( Khatau et al . , 2009 ; Kim et al . , 2012 ) . It was recently reported that increased tension on the actin - cap - linked stress ﬁbers promotes the formation of indentation sites in the nuclear lamina that also affect chromatin condensation ( Versae - vel et al . , 2014 ) . The phospho - myosin - containing actin cap ﬁbers are physically connected to the nuclear lamina by the so - called LINC complex ( Khatau et al . , 2009 ; Starr and Fridolfsson , 2010 ) . This raised the question of whether disruption of the nu - clear lamina upon ADF and CFL1 depletion involved the LINC complex . We therefore depleted Nesprin - 2 giant and SUN1 , components of the LINC complex that tether actin ﬁlaments from the cytoplasm to the nuclear membrane ( Crisp et al . , 2006 ) . This resulted in a decoupling of the actin cytoskeleton from the nuclei upon knockdown of Nesprin - 2G , or SUN1 knock - down , and this rescued the nuclear deformation phenotype induced by ADF / CFL1 co - depletion . In addition to the phenotypes we describe , double depletion of ADF and CFL1 commonly resulted in multi - nucleation . We have not focused on this aspect of the phenotype here as it has been reported previously in other systems and it is likely due to impaired ﬁnal stages of cell division caused by dysfunctional contractile rings ( Hotulainen et al . , 2005 ; Tahtamouni et al . , 2013 ) . Taken together , our results demonstrate that the uncontrolled contractile actin stress ﬁbers formed upon co - depletion of ADF and CFL1 are responsible for promoting nuclear deformation , likely by exerting increased contractile force to the nuclear enve - lope via its attachments to the LINC complex . This implies that dynamic regulation of actin stress ﬁbers by coﬁlins is vital for the actin - LINC complex to control nuclear shape , movement , and integrity that is lost in an array of diseases , collectively termed as laminopathies ( Dauer and Worman , 2009 ; Gundersen and Worman , 2013 ; Stewart et al . , 2007 ) . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Experiments involving animals were carried out in accordance with the UKCCCR guidelines by approved protocol ( HO PL 60 / 4248 ) . Brief experi - mental procedures are listed here . For details , please see the Supplemental Experimental Procedures . Generation of Transgenic Mice Generation of transgenic mice with either deletion of ADF ( Bellenchi et al . , 2007 ) , targetedloxPsitesinthe CFL1 gene ( Gurniaketal . , 2005 ) , orexpressing the modiﬁed Cre recombinase - estrogen receptor fusion under control of the Keratin - 14 promoter ( K14CreER T2 ; Li et al . , 2000 ) has been described . To enable cell - type - speciﬁc CFL1 ablation , ADF (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice and CFL1 ﬂ / ﬂ mice were mated to K14CreER T2 mice . This resulted in offspring that carried K14CreER T2 and were nullizygous for ADF and homozygous for the ﬂoxed CFL1 gene ( K14CreER T2 / ADF (cid:1) / (cid:1) / CFL1 ﬂ / ﬂ ) , offspring that were nullizygous for ADF but carried two copies of the WT CFL1 allele ( K14CreER T2 / ADF (cid:1) / (cid:1) / CFL1 WT / WT ) or offspring that carried two copies of the WT ADF allele but were homozygous for the ﬂoxed CFL1 gene ( K14CreER T2 / ADF WT / WT / CFL1 ﬂ / ﬂ ) . Preparation and Administration of 4 - OHT Tamoxifen ( 4 - OHT ) was administered to 60 - day - old K14 - ADF mice as described ( Indra et al . , 1999 ) with minor modiﬁcations . The animals were then left for 10 days before experiments initiated except for K14CreER T2 / ADF (cid:1) / (cid:1) CFL1 ﬂ / ﬂ mice , which were culled and tissue collected at 4 or 5 days . For in vitro experiments , 4 - OHT was dissolved in ethanol and used at a ﬁnal concentration of 10 nM . Isolation of Primary Keratinocytes from Mouse Tails Tail skin was collected from mice with the desired genotype , and epidermis wasremovedandprocessed todissociatekeratinocytes thatwere maintained on collagen - I - coated plates . Generation of SCC Cell Lines Ras - driven chemically induced tumors were introduced to mice as described ( McLean et al . , 2001 ) . Tumors derived from mice nullizygous to ADF were utilized to generate ADF - null SCC cell lines . ( C ) Quantiﬁcation of cells that , after these treatments , showed non - fragmented nuclei .
