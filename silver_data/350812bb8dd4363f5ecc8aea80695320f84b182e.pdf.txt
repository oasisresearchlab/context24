Theme Section on : ' The use and misuse of bibliometric indices in evaluating scholarly performance ' Validating Research Performance Metrics Against Peer Rankings Stevan Harnad Chaire de recherche du Canada Institut des sciences cognitives Universite du Quebec a Montreal Montreal , Quebec , Canada H3C 3P8 and Department of Electronics and Computer Science University of Southampton Highfield , Southampton SO17 1BJ UNITED KINGDOM http : / / www . ecs . soton . ac . uk / ~ harnad / ABSTRACT : A rich and diverse set of potential bibliometric and scientometric predictors of research performance quality and importance are emerging today , from the classic metrics ( publication counts , journal impact factors and individual article / author citation counts ) to promising new online metrics such as download counts , hub / authority scores and growth / decay chronometrics . In and of themselves , however , metrics are circular : They need to be jointly tested and validated against what it is that they purport to measure and predict , with each metric weighted according to its contribution to their joint predictive power . The natural criterion against which to validate metrics is expert evaluation by peers , and a unique opportunity to do this is offered by the 2008 UK Research Assessment Exercise , in which a full spectrum of metrics can be jointly tested , field by field , against peer rankings . KEY WORDS : Bibliometrics - Citation Analysis - Journal Impact Factor - Metric Validation - Multiple Regression - Peer Review - Research Assessment â€“ Scientometrics - Web Metrics INTRODUCTION Philosophers have a saying1 ( about those who are sceptical about metaphysics ) : " Show me someone who wishes to refute metaphysics and I ' ll show you a metaphysician with a rival system " ( meaning that there is no escaping metaphysics one way or the other : even anti - metaphysics is metaphysics ) . The same could be said of bibliometrics , or , more broadly , scientometrics . If we divide the evaluation of scientific and scholarly research into ( 1 ) subjective evaluation ( peer Harnad , S file : / / / Users / admin / Desktop / esep - harnad . html 2 of 10 27 / 04 / 08 12 : 51 review ) and ( 2 ) objective evaluation ( scientometrics : henceforth just " metrics " ) , then even those who wish to refute metrics in favor of peer review first have to demonstrate that peer review ( 2004a ) is somehow more reliable and valid than metrics : And to demonstrate that without circularity ( i . e . , without simply decreeing that peer review is better because peers agree on what research is better and they also agree that peer review is better than metrics ! ) , peer review too will have to be evaluated objectively , i . e . , via metrics . This is not to say that metrics themselves are exempt from the need from validation either . Trying to validate unvalidated metrics against unvalidated metrics is no better than trying to validate peer review with peer review : Circularity has to be eliminated on both sides . The other contributions to this special ESEP special issue have done a good job pointing out the inappropriateness of the unvalidated use of journal impact factors ( JIFs ) in evaluating anything , be it journal quality , research quality , or researcher quality ( Campbell 2008 ) . Not only is the JIF , in and of itself , not validated as a measure of journal quality , especially when comparing across different fields , but , being a journal average , it is a particularly blunt instrument for evaluating and comparing individual authors or papers : Comparing authors in terms of their JIFs is like comparing university student applicants in terms of the average marks of the secondary schools from which the applicants have graduated , instead of comparing them in terms of their own individual marks ( Moed 2005 ) . VALIDATING METRICS Psychometrics of Cognitive Performance Capacty But even author citation counts stand unvalidated in and of themselves . The problem can be best illustrated with an example from another metric field : psychometrics ( Kline 2000 ) . If we wish to construct a test of human aptitude , it is not sufficient simply to invent test - items that we hypothesize to be measuring the performance capacity in question , and use those items to construct a set that is internally consistent ( i . e . , higher scorers tend to score higher on all items , and vice versa ) and repeatable ( i . e . , the same individual tends to get the same score on repeated sittings ) . So far , that is merely a reliable test , not necessarily a valid one . Let us call the capacity we are trying to measure and predict with our test our " criterion . " To validate a psychometric test , we have to show either that the test has face - validity ( i . e . , that it is itself a direct measure of the criterion , as in the case of a long - distance swimming test to test long - distance swimming ability , or a calculational test to test calculating ability ) or , in the absence of face - validity , we have to show that our test is strongly correlated either with a face - valid test of the criterion or with a test that has already been validated ( as being correlated with the criterion ) . Scientometrics of Research Performance Quality In psychometrics , it is the correlation with the criterion that gets us out of the problem of circularity . But what is the criterion in the case of scientometrics ? Presumably it is research performance quality itself . But what is the face - valid measure of research performance quality ? Apart from the rare cases where a Harnad , S file : / / / Users / admin / Desktop / esep - harnad . html 3 of 10 27 / 04 / 08 12 : 51 piece of research instantly generates acknowledged break - throughs or applications , the research cycle is too slow and uncertain to provide an immediate face - valid indicator of quality . So what do we do ? We turn to expert judgment : Journals ( and research funders ) consult qualified peer referees to evaluate the quality of research output ( or , in the case of grants , the quality of research proposals ) . Now , as noted , peer review itself stands in need of validation , just as metrics do : Even if we finesse the problem of reliability , by only considering peer judgments on which there is substantial agreement ( Harnad 1985 ) , it still cannot be said that peer review is a face - valid measure of research quality or importance , just as citation counts are not a face - valid measure of research quality or importance . Getting Metrics of the Ground It is useful again to return to the analogous case of psychometrics : How did IQ testing first get off the ground , given that there was no face - valid measure of intelligence ? IQ tests were bootstrapped in two ways : First , there were ( 1 ) " expert " ratings of pupils ' performance , by their teachers . Teacher ratings are better than nothing , but of course they too , like peer review , are neither face - valid nor already validated . In addition , there was the reasonable hypothesis that , whatever intelligence was , ( 2 ) the children who at a given age could do what most children could only do at an older age were more likely to be more intelligent ( and vice versa ) . The " Q " in IQ refers to the " Intelligence Quotient " : the ratio of an individual child ' s test scores ( mental age ) to the test norms for their own age ( chronological age ) . Now this risks being merely a measure of precociousness or developmental delay , rather than intelligence , unless it can be shown that , in the long run , the children with the higher IQ ratios do indeed turn out to be the more intelligent ones . And in that case psychometricians had the advantage of being able to follow children and their test scores and their teacher ratings through their life cycles long enough and on a large enough population to be able to validate and calibrate the tests they constructed against their later academic and professional performance . Once tests are validated , the rest becomes a matter of optimization through calibration and fine - tuning , including the addition of further tests . Multiple Metrics : Multiple Regression Psychometric tests and performance capacity turned out to be multifactorial : No single test covers all of our aptitudes . It requires a battery of different tests ( of reasoning ability , calculation , verbal skill , spatial visualization , etc . ) to be able to make an accurate assessment of individuals ' performance capacity and to predict their future academic and professional success . There exist general cognitive abilities as well as domain - specific special abilities ( such as those required for music , drawing , sports ) ; and even the domain - general abilities can be factored into a large single general intelligence factor , or " G " , plus a number of lesser cognitive factors ( Kline 2000 ) . Each test has differential weightings on the underlying factors , and that is why multiple tests rather than just a single test need to be used for evaluation and prediction . Scientometric measures do not consist of multiple tests with multiple items ( Moed 2005 ) . They are individual one - dimensional metrics , such as journal impact factors or individual citation counts . Some apriori functions of several variables such as the h - index ( Hirsch 2005 ) have also been proposed Harnad , S file : / / / Users / admin / Desktop / esep - harnad . html 4 of 10 27 / 04 / 08 12 : 51 recently , but they too yield one - dimensional metrics . Many further metrics have been proposed or are possible , among them ( 1 ) download counts ( Hitchcock et al 2003 ) , ( 2 ) chronometrics ( growth - and decay - rate parameters for citations and downloads ; Brody et al . 2006 ) , ( 3 ) Google PageRank - like recursively weighted citation counts ( citations from highly cited articles or authors get higher weights ; Page et al 1999 ) , ( 4 ) co - citation analysis , ( 5 ) hub / authority metrics ( Kleinberg 1999 ) , ( 6 ) endogamy / exogamy metrics ( narrowness / width of citations across co - authors , authors and fields ) , ( 7 ) text - overlap and other semiometric measures , ( 8 ) prior research funding levels , doctoral student counts , etc . ( Harnad 2004b ; Harzing 2008 ) . Without exception , however , none of these metrics can be said to have face validity : They still require objective validation . How to validate them ? Jointly analyzing them for their intercorrelational structure could yield some common underlying factors that each metric measures to varying degrees , but that would still be circular because neither the metrics nor the factors have been validated against their external criterion . Validating Metrics Against Peer Rankings What is that external criterion - - the counterpart of psychometric performance capacity - - in the case of research performance quality ? The natural candidate is peer review . Peer review does not have face - validity either , but ( a ) we rely on it already and ( b ) it is what critics of metrics typically recommend in place of metrics . So the natural way to test the validity of metrics is against peer review . If metrics and per rankings turn out to be uncorrelated , that will be bad news . If they turn out to be strongly correlated , then we can have confidence in going on to use the metrics independently . Peer rankings can even be used to calibrate and optimize the relative " weights " on each of the metrics in our joint battery of candidate metrics , discipline by discipline . The simplest case of linear regression analysis is the correlation of one variable ( the " predictor " ) with another ( the " criterion " ) . Correlations can vary from + 1 to - 1 . The square of the correlation coefficient indicates the percentage of the variability in the criterion variable that is predictable from the predictor variable . In multiple regression analysis , there can be P different predictor variables and C different criterion variables . Again , the square of the overall PC correlation indicates what percentage of the variability in the criterion variables is jointly predictable from the predictor variables . Each of the individual predictor variables also has a ( " beta " ) weight that indicates what proportion of that overall predictability is contributed by that particular variable . Now if we take peer review rankings as our ( single ) criterion ( having first tested multiple peer rankings for reliability ) , and we take our battery of candidate metrics as our predictors , this yields a mutiple regression equation of the form b 1 P 1 + b 2 P 2 + . . . b p P p = C . If the overall correlation of P with C is high , then we have a set of metrics that has been jointly validated against peer review ( and , incidentally , vice versa ) . The metrics will have to be validated separately field by field , and their profile of beta weights will differ from field to field . Even after validation , the initialized beta weights of the battery of metrics for each research field will still have to be calibrated , updated and optimized , in continuing periodic cross - checks against peer review , along with ongoing checks on internal consistency for both Harnad , S file : / / / Users / admin / Desktop / esep - harnad . html 5 of 10 27 / 04 / 08 12 : 51 the metrics and the peer rankings . But the metrics will have been validated . The UK Research Assessment Exercise Is there any way this validation could actually be done ? After all , journal peer review ( as well as grant - proposal peer review ) are done piece - wise , locally , and their referee ratings are both confidential and un - normalized . Hence they would not be jointly useable and comparable even if we had them available for every paper published within each field . There is , however , one systematic database that provides peer rankings for all research output in all fields at the scale of the entire research output of a large nation and research provider : The United Kingdom ' s Research Assessment Exercise ( RAE ) ( Harnad 2007 ; Butler 2008 ) . For over two decades now , the UK has assembled peer panels to evaluate and rank the research output of every active researcher in every department of every UK university every six years . ( The departments were then accorded top - sliced research funding in proportion to their RAE ranks . ) The process was very costly and time - consuming . Moreover , it was shown in a number of correlational studies that the peer rankings were highly correlated with citation metrics in all fields tested ( Oppenheim 1996 ) â€“ even though citations were not counted in doing the peer rankings . It was accordingly decided that after one grand parallel ranking / metrics exercise in 2008 , the RAE would be replaced by metrics alone , supplememented by ' light - touch ' peer review in some fields . The Open Access Research Web : A Synergy The database for the last 2008 RAE hence provides a unique opportunity to validate a rich and diverse battery of candidate metrics for each discipline : The broader the spectrum of potential metrics tested , the greater the potential for validity , predictiveness , and customizability according to each discipline ' s own unique profile . And as a bonus , generating and harvesting metrics on the Open Access Research Web will not only help measure and predict research performance and productivity : it will also help maximize it ( Shadbolt et al 2006 ) . It has now been demonstrated in over a dozen disciplines , systematically comparing articles published in the same journal and year , that the citation counts of the articles that are made freely accessible to all would - be users on the web ( Open Access , OA ) are on average twice as high as the citation counts of those that are not ( Lawrence 2001 ; Harnad & Brody 2004 ; Hajjem et al 2005 ; see Figure 1 ) . Harnad , S file : / / / Users / admin / Desktop / esep - harnad . html 6 of 10 27 / 04 / 08 12 : 51 Figure 1 . Percent increase in citations for articles ( in the same issue and journal ) that are made freely accessible online ( Open Access , OA ) compared to those that are not . The OA advantage has been found in all fields tested . ( Data from Harnad & Brody 2004 and Hajjem et al 2005 . ) There are many different factors contributing to this ' Open Access Impact Advantage ' - - including an early access advantage ( when the preprint is made accessible before the published postprint ) , a quality bias ( higher quality articles are more likely to be made OA ) , a quality advantage ( higher quality articles benefit more from being made OA for users who cannot otherwise afford access ) , a usage advantage ( OA articles are more accessible , more quickly and easily , for downloading ) and a competitive advantage ( which will vanish once all articles are OA ) â€“ but it is clear that OA is a net benefit to research and researchers in all fields . Just as peer rankings and metrics can be used to mutually validate one another , so metrics can be used as incentives for providing OA , while OA itself , as it grows , enhances the predictive and directive power of metrics ( Brody et al 2007 ) : The prospect of increasing their usage and citation metrics ( and their attendant rewards ) is an incentive to researchers to provide Open Access to their findings . The resulting increase in epenly accessible research not only means more research access , usage and progress , but it provides more open ways to harvest , data - mine and analyze both the research findings and the metrics themselves . This means richer metrics , and faster and more direct feedback between research output and metrics , helping to identify and reward ongoing research , and even to help set the direction for future research . Citebase : A Scientometric Search Engine A foretaste of the Open Access Research Web is given by Citebase , a scientometric search engine ( Brody et al 2006 ; Hitchcock et al 2003 : http : / / www . citebase . org / ) . Based mostly on the Physics Arxiv , Citebase reference - links its nearly 500 , 000 papers and can rank search results on the basis of citation counts , download counts , and various other metrics ( see Figure 2 ) that Citebase provides . Harnad , S file : / / / Users / admin / Desktop / esep - harnad . html 7 of 10 27 / 04 / 08 12 : 51 Figure 2 . Some of the metrics on which Citebase http : / / www . citebase . org / can rank search results . For a given paper , Citebase can also generate growth curves for downloads and the growth of citations ( see Figure 3 ) . It turns out that early download growth is a predictor of later citation growth ( Brody et al . 2006 ) . Figure 3 . Citebase http : / / www . citebase . org / growth curves for citations ( red ) and downloads ( green ) for a particularly important author in physics ( E . Witten ) . The various different metrics according to which Citebase can rank papers or authors can only be applied individually , one at a time in the current implementation . There is a menu ( Figure 4 : ' Rank matches byÃ‰ ' ) that allows the user to pick the metric . But in principle it is possible to redesign Citebase so as to rank according to multiple metrics at once , and even to adjust the weight on each metric . Imagining several of the vertical metric ranking options in Figure 2 arranged instead horizontally , with an adjustable weight ( from - 1 to + 1 ) on each , gives an idea of how a search engine like this could be used to calibrate the outcomes of the multiple regression analysis described earlier for validating metrics . Exploratory analysis as well as fine - tuning adjustments could then be done by tweaking the beta Harnad , S file : / / / Users / admin / Desktop / esep - harnad . html 8 of 10 27 / 04 / 08 12 : 51 weights . Figure 4 . Citebase http : / / www . citebase . org / allows users to choose the metrics on which they wish to rank papers , as well as to allowing them to navigate on the basis of of citation links .
