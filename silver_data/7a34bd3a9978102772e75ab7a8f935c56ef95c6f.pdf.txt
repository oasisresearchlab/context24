Case patients had higher odds of exposure to peripherally inserted central catheters ( OR , 7 . 20 ; 95 % CI , 1 . 75 – 37 . 30 ) and invasive ventilation ( OR , 5 . 79 ; 95 % CI , 1 . 39 – 30 . 62 ) . Of 42 environmental samples , 28 ( 67 % ) grew P . aeruginosa . Isolates from the 2 most recent case patients were indistinguishable by pulsed - ﬁ eld gel electrophoresis from water - related samples obtained from these case - patient rooms . conclusions . This outbreak was attributed to contaminated water . Interruption of the outbreak with point - of - use ﬁ lters provided a short - term solution ; however , eradication of P . aeruginosa in water and ﬁ xtures was necessary to protect patients . This outbreak highlights the importance of understanding the risks of stagnant water in healthcare facilities . Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol 2017 ; 1 – 8 Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a gram - negative nonfermenting bacillus in water and soil that has been implicated in healthcare - associated infections in intensive care settings . 1 , 2 Patients in neonatal intensive care units ( NICUs ) are particularly vulnerable to infection because of underdeveloped immune systems , limited skin barrier functions , and exposure to invasive procedures and devices . 3 Multiple P . aeruginosa outbreaks have been documented in NICUs and have been attributed to con - taminated medications , respiratory equipment , laryngoscopes , and personnel hand contamination . 4 – 12 Pseudomonas aeruginosa outbreaks have also been associated with contaminated hospital tap water 11 – 14 because the organism is hardy and can form bio ﬁ lms in plumbing ﬁ xtures that resist chemical treatment . 15 In fall 2013 , a P . aeruginosa outbreak involving 15 patients and 2 deaths occurred in a 28 - bed NICU that admits 370 – 450 patients / year . The NICU has private patient rooms each with 1 sink , and is located in a newly constructed building that opened to patient care in May 2013 . During outbreak response , the hospital noti ﬁ ed the county health department , diverted admissions to another NICU , and performed water remediation , including installation of disposable membrane ﬁ ltration point - of - use ( POU ) ﬁ lters on faucets in November 2013 . Environmental samples collected during November 2013 – May 2014 from pre ﬁ ltered water in the NICU yielded P . aeruginosa , but no strain types matched patient isolates . During May 21 – June 9 , 2014 , new faucets were installed in the NICU and POU ﬁ lters were removed . Starting June 22 , 2014 , a second cluster of cases occurred , including 1 patient death . Again , admissions to NICU were diverted . On September 23 , 2014 , the state health department invited the Centers for Af ﬁ liations : 1 .

Herein , we present ﬁ ndings and recommendations from the CDC investigation . methods Case De ﬁ nition and Case Finding We de ﬁ ned a case as the ﬁ rst positive P . aeruginosa culture from a clinical or surveillance specimen in a patient admitted to the NICU between June 1 , 2013 , and September 30 , 2014 . Cases were identi ﬁ ed through hospital microbiology record review . We classi ﬁ ed cases as either clinical or surveillance based on the indication for testing . Surveillance specimens were collected during periods when unit policy mandated weekly cultures for all patients . This policy was in effect from November 26 , 2013 , to January 31 , 2014 , and from August 29 , 2014 , to September 30 , 2014 . Certain surveillance cultures were collected outside these periods at provider discretion . Infection Control Assessment We conducted observations of NICU infection control and clinical care . We conducted > 10 hours of hand hygiene audits at 30 – 120 minutes per session ( median length , 35 minutes ) during all shifts . A hand - hygiene opportunity 16 was marked unsuccessful if the hand - hygiene practice observed did not comply with the NICU policy . Hospital occupational health services examined NICU personnel hands and reviewed health histories regarding potential P . aeruginosa colonization ( eg , history of otitis externa ) . We also conducted audits of contact precautions and central - line insertion and maintenance practices using standardized audit tools . 17 We observed respiratory therapy , feeding practices , equipment reprocessing , pharmacy practices , envir - onmental cleaning , an eye exam , and routine patient care . Environmental Evaluation We performed environmental sampling in NICU patient areas with the strongest epidemiologic links to cases ( ie , rooms with multiple cases or a recent case ) on September 29 , 2014 . To collect samples , we removed POU ﬁ lters from faucets and collected 1 - liter water samples . POU ﬁ lters were replaced after sampling . We also collected swab samples from faucets and drains and sponge - stick samples from sink basins . We collected additional sponge - stick and swab samples from ventilator equipment , breast pumps , an incubator humidity outlet , and shelves adjacent to the patient room sinks . We collected water samples from pipes delivering hot and cold water to the ﬂ oor where the NICU was located . Samples were submitted to CDC for culture by membrane ﬁ ltration of water and by homogenization and extraction of swabs and sponge sticks . Nonlactose fermenting , pigmented colonies that grew on MacConkey selective agar were identi ﬁ ed as P . aeruginosa using an automated biochemical identi ﬁ cation system . To determine relatedness , pulsed - ﬁ eld gel electrophoresis ( PFGE ) was performed at the CDC on 21 P . aeruginosa environmental isolates and 10 case isolates ( 5 surveillance and 5 clinical ) . We selected case isolates from the hospital laboratory that represented the most recent case patients or those with an epidemiologic link to environmental samples . Risk Factors : Case - Control Study To assess risk factors for positive P . aeruginosa culture , we conducted a case - control study . Surveillance and clinical cases were combined because the primary study focus was on assessing transmission risk factors . Control patients were deemed eligible if they ( 1 ) were admitted to the NICU between June 1 , 2013 , and September 30 , 2014 ; ( 2 ) had a negative surveillance culture for P . aeruginosa ; and ( 3 ) did not have any cultures positive for P . aeruginosa during the study period . We selected control patients randomly from an eligible patient list . Because case - patient birth weights were markedly lower than those of the general NICU population , we matched case patients 1 : 1 with a control patient according to the following birth weight categories : ≤ 1 , 000 g , 1 , 001 – 1 , 500 g , 1 , 501 – 2 , 500 g , and ≥ 2 , 501 g to ensure that control patients received similar exposures as case patients . The index date for controls was the most recent negative surveillance culture date . We abstracted data from electronic medical records using a standard form that included the following data : demographics , maternal and obstetrical history , medical history and comor - bidities , medication and device exposure , nutrition , signs and symptoms before positive culture , laboratory and microbiology ﬁ ndings , environmental exposure ( ie , bed type and room number ) , exposure to NICU personnel , and clinical outcomes . We assessed exposures during the 7 days prior to positive cul - ture or the index date for all variables except antibiotic exposure , which we assessed during the 30 days prior to positive culture . Statistical Analysis We performed descriptive analyses of characteristics and exposures of case patients and control patients . We used conditional logistic regression adjusted for gestational age to evaluate the association between case status and each exposure . We reported exact odds ratios and 95 % con ﬁ dence intervals ( CIs ) due to limited sample size . We pooled matched sets according to the recommendations of Kleinbaum and Klein , 18 resulting in models strati ﬁ ed by birth - weight category . Ethical Review The CDC National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases reviewed this investigation for human subjects ’ protection and determined that it constituted an urgent public health response . 2 infection control & hospital epidemiology https : / www . cambridge . org / core / terms . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1017 / ice . 2017 . 87 Downloaded from https : / www . cambridge . org / core . Cornell University Library , on 19 May 2017 at 19 : 17 : 49 , subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use , available at results Case Finding and Con ﬁ rmation We identi ﬁ ed 31 cases that occurred in 2 distinct clusters , September – November 2013 and August – September 2014 ( Figure 1 ) and included 3 deaths . Clinical cases ( n = 17 ) con - sisted of blood , respiratory , urine , and eye cultures ; surveillance cases ( n = 14 ) included respiratory , groin , and nasal cultures . Most case patients were Hispanic ( 58 % ) ; approximately half ( 52 % ) were male ( Table 1 ) . Approximately half ( 52 % ) had a birth weights of ≤ 1 , 000 g . For comparison , < 10 % of patients admitted to this NICU were extremely low birth weight ( ≤ 1 , 000 g ) during the study period . Cases occurred in patients occupying different rooms and areas in the NICU ( Figure 2 ) . Infection Control Assessment Before our investigation , the hospital implemented multiple infection control measures , including contact precautions for patients with a positive P . aeruginosa culture . NICU policy required personnel to use gloves during all patient contact . Our investigation revealed inconsistent hand - hygiene prac - tices among direct patient care personnel , including use of soap and water over alcohol - based hand rub ( ABHR ) when not indicated ( Figure 3 ) . NICU policy was changed to specify preferential use of ABHR on October 2 , 2014 . No risk factors for colonization ( eg , hot tub use ) or skin breakdown on personnel hands were identi ﬁ ed . Review of feeding practices revealed that breast pump parts were washed in tap water , according to manufacturer instructions ; however , the manufacturer recommendation for daily sanitation of breast pump parts was not performed . Other infection control audits by the investigation team did not reveal breaches or other evidence of tap water exposure to NICU patients . Environmental Evaluation Our investigation revealed that although NICU patient care had been moved to the new hospital building in May 2013 , water treatment , system ﬂ ushing , and water testing after the construc - tion process was complete were completed in February 2013 . From February to May 2013 , water in the hospital pipes was idle . After the ﬁ rst cluster of NICU P . aeruginosa cases was identi ﬁ ed in the autumn of 2013 , interventions were exercised given suspicion that hospital water supply was the bacteria source . The hospital removed aerators from faucets ; cleaned , disinfected , and removed mineral deposits on faucets and sink ﬁ xtures ; and performed multiple hyperchlorination ﬂ ushes of the building ’ s water system ( Figure 1 ) . The hospital also installed POU ﬁ lters on all NICU faucets in December 2013 . In May 2014 , the hospital removed POU ﬁ lters when NICU faucets were replaced with a different model thought less likely ﬁ gure 1 .

After the second cluster of cases began in June 2014 , POU ﬁ lters were reinstalled on NICU faucets September 23 , 2014 , per our recommendation . A company contracted by the hospital sampled pre ﬁ ltered water monthly from November 2013 to January 2014 , and during May 2014 to detect P . aeruginosa . Multiple samples grew P . aeruginosa , with high colony counts occurring in May 2014 , before faucet replacement ; however , no PFGE matches were identi ﬁ ed among environmental and patient isolates . In conjunction with hospital engineering staff , we also evaluated the plumbing system for terminal dead ends and areas of poor water ﬂ ow leading to the NICU ; none were found . Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated from 28 of 42 ( 67 % ) environmental samples collected by our CDC team in September 2014 . Of 32 samples of tap water and bio ﬁ lms associated with tap water ( eg , faucet , drain , and sink basin ) , 27 ( 84 % ) were positive for P . aeruginosa ( Table 2 ) . PFGE analysis of CDC environmental samples and patient isolates sent to the CDC laboratory revealed 4 unrelated groups of environmental and patient isolates with indistinguishable PFGE patterns ( Figure 4 ) . Isolates from 2 case patients were indistinguishable by PFGE from environmental isolates collected in the rooms occupied by each case patient . Risk Factors : Case - Control Study After adjustment for gestational age , case patients had higher odds of exposure to a peripherally inserted central catheter ( PICC ) ( exact odds ratio [ eOR ] , 7 . 20 ; 95 % CI , 1 . 75 – 37 . 30 ) or invasive ventilation ( eOR , 5 . 79 ; 95 % CI , 1 . 39 – 30 . 62 ) , com - pared with controls ( Table 3 ) . In addition , case patients had higher odds of having received care in a room with no POU ﬁ lter installed on the sink faucet during the 7 days before posi - tive culture ( eOR , 37 . 55 ; 95 % CI , 7 . 16 – ∞ ) . All 31 case patients were in rooms without POU ﬁ lters during the 7 days before positive culture , compared with 14 ( 45 % ) control patients . discussion Tap water was implicated as the source of a P . aeruginosa outbreak in an NICU that occurred after a new building was opened . Case clusters occurred before POU ﬁ lters were installed and after they were removed . Residing in a room without a POU ﬁ lter was the strongest risk factor for having a positive P . aeruginosa culture . POU ﬁ lter reinstallation inter - rupted the outbreak in the short term . Patients with PICCs or invasive ventilation were also at increased risk . table 1 .

Cornell University Library , on 19 May 2017 at 19 : 17 : 49 , subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use , available at A substantial percentage of environmental samples from water , faucets , drains , sink basins , and shelves near sinks were positive for P . aeruginosa . Although isolates indistinguishable by PFGE were identi ﬁ ed from patients and the environment , a high level of genetic diversity existed among environmental and patient isolates . This ﬁ nding is consistent with a previous NICU outbreak investigation 12 and with potential bio ﬁ lm formation in the pipes , faucets , or drains . Bio ﬁ lm promotes genetic diversity 20 and is known to form on pipes or other ﬁ xtures in stagnant water . 15 , 21 Water in the hospital remained stagnant for 3 months after completion of hospital construc - tion , allowing ample time for bio ﬁ lm formation . Flushing or disinfection of water systems might be prudent if water remains stagnant > 8 hours . 22 – 24 Daily ﬂ ushing of unused taps in NICUs is recommended . 25 Although water was implicated as the source , we did not identify a de ﬁ nitive mechanism of exposure of patients to the water . However , opportunities for tap water exposure might have been related to hand washing and other care practices ( eg , cleaning of breast pump parts ) . We did not identify breaches in infection control related to PICCs or ventilators ; however , the presence of these devices might increase exposure to staff hands during manipulation or might be a marker for increased vulnerability to infection . Consistent with other NICU outbreaks of P . aeruginosa , case patients were more likely to be extremely low birth weight compared with the general population of NICU infants . 4 , 7 Before our investigation , staff did not receive consistent guidance emphasizing the preferential use of ABHR over washing with soap and water , according to CDC guidelines . 16 Hand washing with contaminated water by healthcare per - sonnel might have contributed to transmission . We recom - mended that the hospital revise policies for hand hygiene in accordance with CDC guidelines . In addition , given the evi - dence of water contamination , the hospital implemented a policy of using ABHR after hand washing with soap and water in the NICU , until water remediation efforts could be ensured . ﬁ gure 2 .

The NICU policy for hand hygiene was to use either soap and water or alcohol - based hand rub ( ABHR ) until October 2 , 2014 , when it was changed to re ﬂ ect a preference for ABHR unless hands are visibly soiled , according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines . table 2 .

Cornell University Library , on 19 May 2017 at 19 : 17 : 49 , subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use , available at Continuous education of healthcare personnel , auditing , and feedback about adherence to hand - hygiene policies were recommended . Staff hands could have also been indirectly contaminated with P . aeruginosa through touching sink basins or nearby shelves . Although colonized staff have been implicated in transmission of P . aeruginosa in previous out - breaks , 7 , 26 , 27 we did not ﬁ nd an association between speci ﬁ c staff members and cases . Our epidemic curve and case - control study provide evi - dence that POU ﬁ lters interrupted this P . aeruginosa outbreak in the short term , consistent with published literature . 28 , 29 Although a single study determined that POU ﬁ lters are the most economical means of protecting vulnerable hospital patients from waterborne pathogens , 30 others caution against their use as a long - term solution . 31 We recommended POU ﬁ ltration continue until P . aeruginosa is no longer detected in the hospital water . We recommended validation of remedia - tion measures through monthly microbiologic testing of pre ﬁ ltered water and validation of the POU ﬁ lters by testing post ﬁ lter water monthly before the scheduled replacement of the ﬁ lter . The goal of remediation was total heterotrophic plate counts ≤ 500 CFU / mL ( in accordance with Environmental Protection Agency standards for safe drinking water 32 ) and no Pseudomonas . Cultures of post ﬁ lter water should be negative . During the following months , the hospital followed these recommendations and continued additional water remedia - tion efforts , including decontamination of faucets and drains , routine ﬂ ushing of faucets , hot water ﬂ ushing of the hospital water system , hyperchlorination , monitoring temperature and water ﬂ ow variability , and continuous supplemental chlorine dioxide . Despite remediation , pre ﬁ ltered water samples continued to grow P . aeruginosa , although levels declined . Post ﬁ lter water samples were negative . From January to November 2015 , 8 new cases of P . aeruginosa occurred in NICU patients , representing an increase over baseline , with 1 death . The hospital continued to work closely with the state health department during this time ; CDC was periodically consulted . In response to these cases , the hospital hired outside experts to direct water remediation . We continued to recommend regular testing of post ﬁ lter water to ensure proper ﬁ lter function and strict adherence to infection control measures until eradication of P . aeruginosa could be maintained . The reasons for continued cases was unknown , ﬁ gure 4 . Dendogram for environmental and case - patient isolates collected during a Pseudomonas aeruginosa outbreak in a neonatal intensive care unit .

Cornell University Library , on 19 May 2017 at 19 : 17 : 49 , subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use , available at but multiple possibilities were considered , including breaches in infection control or POU ﬁ lter failure . The state health department considered the outbreak over in March 2016 , after substantial reduction of P . aeruginosa in water samples was achieved and no new cases were reported . The hospital ceased routine patient surveillance cultures at this time . By June 2016 , P . aeruginosa was no longer detected in the ﬁ xtures in the NICU ( < 1 CFU / 100 mL ) ; the hospital opted to continue using POU ﬁ lters as an added precaution . Multiple factors limited our investigation . The case - control study was limited by the size of the NICU population and precluded matching of cases and controls using a ratio greater than 1 : 1 , matching by NICU admission date , or performing multivariable modeling . Our ﬁ ndings are consistent with the statement made by Williams et al 15 that waterborne healthcare - associated infec - tions occur “ at the 3 - way intersection of nonsterile potable water , susceptible individuals , and a lapse in infection control practices . ” All 3 factors likely contributed to this outbreak . Although interruption of the outbreak with POU ﬁ lters provided a short - term solution , eradication of P . aeruginosa in the hospital water , faucets , and sinks was necessary to protect patients . This outbreak highlights the importance of addressing and understanding the inherent risks ( eg , bio ﬁ lm formation ) in healthcare facilities where water has been stagnant for extended periods . acknowledgments We acknowledge the substantial contributions of the hospital staff where the outbreak occurred and their commitment to patient safety .
