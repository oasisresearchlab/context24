By mechanotransduction systems , cells translate these stimuli into biochemical signals controlling multiple aspects of cell behaviour , including growth , differentiation and cancer malignant progression , but how rigidity mechanosensing is ultimately linked to activity of nuclear transcription factors remains poorly understood . Here we report the identification of the Yorkie - homologues YAP ( Yes - associated protein ) and TAZ ( transcriptional coactivator with PDZ - binding motif , also known as WWTR1 ) as nuclear relays of mechanical signals exerted by ECM rigidity and cell shape . This regulation requires Rho GTPase activity and tension of the actomyosin cytoskeleton , but is independent of the Hippo / LATS cascade . Crucially , YAP / TAZ are functionally required for differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells induced by ECM stiffness and for survival of endothelial cells regulated by cell geometry ; conversely , expression of activated YAP overrules physical constraints in dictating cell behaviour . These findings identify YAP / TAZ as sensors and mediators of mechanical cues instructed by the cellular microenvironment . Physical properties of the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) and mechanical forces are integral to morphogenetic processes in embryonic develop - ment , definingtissuearchitectureanddrivingspecificcelldifferentiation programs 1 . In adulthood , tissue homeostasis remains dependent on physical cues , such that perturbations of ECM stiffness—or mutations affecting its perception—are causal to pathological conditions of mul - tiple organs , contributes to ageing and cancer malignant progression 2 . Mechanotransduction enables cells to sense and adapt to external forces and physical constraints 3 , 4 ; these mechanoresponses involve the rapid remodelling of the cytoskeleton , but also require the activa - tion of specific genetic programs . In particular , variations of ECM stiffness or changes in cell shape caused by confining the cell’s adhes - ive area have a profound impact on cell behaviour across several cell types , such as mesenchymal stem cells 5 , 6 , muscle stem cells 7 and endothelial cells 8 . The nuclear factors mediating the biological res - ponse to these physical inputs remain incompletely understood . ECM stiffness regulates YAP / TAZ activity Togaininsightintotheseissues , weaskedifphysical / mechanicalstimuli conveyed by ECM stiffness actually signal through known signalling pathways . For this , we performed a bioinformatic analysis on genes differentially expressed in mammary epithelial cells ( MEC ) grown on ECMofhighversuslowstiffness 9 . Specifically , wesearchedforstatistical associations between genes regulated by stiffness and gene signatures denoting the activation of specific signalling pathways ( Supplementary Fig . 2 , Supplementary Table1 and Methods ) . We included signatures of MAL / SRF and NF - k B as these factors translocate in the nucleus in response to changes in F - actin polymerization and cell stretching 10 . Strikingly , only signatures revealing activation of YAP / TAZ transcrip - tional regulators emerged as significantly overrepresented in the set of genes regulated by high stiffness ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . To test if YAP and TAZ activity is regulated by ECM stiffness , we monitored YAP / TAZ transcriptional activity in human MEC grown onfibronectin - coatedacrylamidehydrogelsofvaryingstiffness ( elastic modulus ranging from 0 . 7 to 40kPa , matching the physiological elasticities of natural tissues 6 ) . For this , we assayed by real - time PCR two of the best YAP / TAZ regulated genes from our signature , CTGF and ANKRD1 . The activity of YAP / TAZ in cells grown on stiff hydro - gels ( 15 – 40kPa ) was comparable to that of cells grown on plastics , whereas growing cells on soft matrices ( in the range of 0 . 7 – 1kPa ) inhibited YAP / TAZ activity to levels comparable to short interfering RNA ( siRNA ) - mediated YAP / TAZ depletion ( Fig . 1a and data not shown ) . We confirmed this finding in other cellular systems , such as MDA - MB - 231 and HeLa cells , where we used a synthetic YAP / TAZ - responsive luciferase reporter ( 4 3 GTIIC - lux ) as direct read - out of their activity ( Fig . 1a and Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . Next , we assayed endogenous YAP / TAZ subcellular localization ; indeed , their cytoplasmic relocalization has been extensively used as primary read - out of their inhibition by the Hippo pathway or by cell – cellcontact ( SupplementaryFig . 5 andref . 11 ) . Byimmunofluorescence on MEC and human mesenchymal stem cells ( MSC , an established non - epithelial cellular model for mechanoresponses 5 , 6 ) , YAP / TAZ were clearly nuclear on hard substrates but became predominantly cytoplasmic on softer substrates ( Fig . 1b and Supplementary Figs 6 and 7 ) . Collectively , these data indicate that YAP / TAZ activity and subcellular localization are regulated by ECM stiffness . YAP / TAZ are regulated by cell geometry It is recognized that changes in ECM stiffness impose different degrees of cell spreading 6 , 12 . We thus asked whether cell spreading is sufficient to regulate YAP / TAZ . To this end , we used micro - patterned fibronectin ‘islands’ of defined size , on which cells can spread to different degrees depending on the available adhesive area 8 . On these micropatterns , the localization of YAP / TAZ changed from predominantly nuclear in spread MSCs , to predominantly cytoplas - mic in cells on smaller islands ( Fig . 1c ) . Of note , the use of single - cell adhesiveislands rules outthepossibility thatcell – cellcontacts could be involvedin YAP / TAZ relocalization . We confirmedthese results using human lung microvascular endothelial cells ( HMVEC , Fig . 1d ) , that are well known to regulate their growth according to cell shape 8 . * Theseauthorscontributedequallytothiswork . 1 DepartmentofHistology , MicrobiologyandMedicalBiotechnologies , UniversityofPaduaSchoolofMedicine , vialeColombo3 , 35131Padua , Italy . 2 DepartmentofChemicalEngineering ( DIPIC ) , University ofPadua , viaMarzolo9 , 35131Padua , Italy . 3 LaboratoireMatie ` reetSyste ` mesComplexes ( MSC ) , Universite´ParisDiderotandCNRSUMR7057 , 10rueA .

All rights reserved ©2011 Cells seeded on stiff hydrogels or large islands show increased cell spreading but , at the same time , experience a broader cell – ECM con - tact area . To test whether YAP / TAZ are regulated by cell spreading irrespectively of the total amount of ECM , we visualized YAP / TAZ localization in MSC grown on the tip of closely arrayed fibronectin - coated micropillars 12 : on these arrays , cells stretch from one micro - pillar to another , and assume a projected cell area comparable to cells plated on big islands ( 3 , 200 m m 2 on average , Fig . 1e ) ; however , in these conditions , the actual area available for cell – ECM interaction is only about 10 % of their projected area ( 300 m m 2 on average , corresponding to the smallest islands used in Fig . 1c ) . YAP / TAZ remained nuclear on micropillars ( Fig . 1e ) , indicating that YAP / TAZ are primarily regu - lated by cell spreading imposed by the ECM . YAP / TAZ sense cytoskeletal tension We then considered that cell spreading entails activation of the small GTPase Rho that , in turn , regulates the formation of actin bundles , stress fibres and tensile actomyosin structures 2 , 3 . Indeed , cells on stiff ECM or big islands had more prominent stress fibres compared to those plated on soft ECM or small islands ( Supplementary Figs 9 and 10 ) . As shown in Fig . 2a , we found that Rho and the actin cytoskeleton are required to maintain nuclear YAP / TAZ in MSC . As a control , inhibition of Rac1 - GEFs ( guanine nucleotide exchange factors ) , or disruption of microtubules , did not alter YAP / TAZ localization ( Fig . 2a ) . Similar results were obtained also in HMVEC and MEC ( not shown ) . Crucially , inhibition of Rho and of the actin cytoskeleton also inhibited YAP / TAZ transcriptional activity , as assayed by expression of endogenous target genes ( Fig . 2b ) and by luciferase reporter assays ( Fig . 2c ) . Conversely , triggeringF - actin polymerization and stress fibres formation by overexpression of activated diaphanous protein ( DIAPH1 ) promoted YAP / TAZ activity ( Supplementary Fig . 12 ) . We then asked whether YAP / TAZ are regulated by the ratio of monomeric / filamentous actin , as others observed for MAL / SRF 13 . To increase monomeric G - actin , we overexpressed the R62D mutant actin 13 , but this was insufficient to inhibit YAP / TAZ ( Fig . 2c ) . Moreover , increasing the amount of F - actin either by overexpressing the F - actin stabilizing V159N actin mutant or by serum stimulation 13 had no effect on YAP / TAZ activity ( Supplementary Fig . 13 ) or nuc - lear localization ( data not shown ) . As a control , in the same experi - mental set - up , MAL / SRF activity was instead clearly modulated a c b Micropillars d 10 , 000 300 μ m 2 100 50 0 siCo . siYZ1 siYZ2 40kPa 0 . 7 kPa m R N A e x p r e ss i o n Lu c i f e r a s e ac t i v i t y 90 60 30 0 CTGF ANKRD1 4xGTIIC - lux 10 , 0002 , 0251 , 024 300 U n p a t t . 1007550250 Nuclear YAP / TAZ ( % ) 10 , 000 2 , 025 1 , 024 300 μ m 2 Unpatt . e 6 , 000 3 , 0000 300 μ m 2 U n p a t t .

Taken altogether , these data indicate that Rho and stress fibres , but not F - actin polymerization per se , are required for YAP / TAZ activity . Cells respond to the rigidity of the ECM by adjusting the tension and organization of their stress fibres , such that cell spreading is accompanied by increased pulling forces against the ECM 3 , 6 , 12 . By inhibition of ROCK and non - muscle myosin 4 , 6 , we found that cyto - skeletal tension isrequired for YAP / TAZ nuclear localization ( Fig . 2d ) and activity ( Fig . 2e and Supplementary Fig . 16 ) . Of note , YAP / TAZ exclusion caused by these inhibitions is an early event ( occurring within 2 h ) that can be uncoupled from destabilization of stress fibres ( see Supplementary Fig . 17 ) . By comparison , the activity of MAL / SRF was only marginally affected by the same treatments ( Supplementary Fig . 18 ) . To address more directly the relevance of cell - generated mechanical force without using small - molecule inhibitors and irre - spectively of the surface properties of the hydrogels , we compared rigid versus highly elastic micropillars 12 ; on the elastic substrate , cyto - plasmic localization of YAP / TAZ was clearly increased ( Fig . 2f ) . Collectively , the data indicate that YAP / TAZ respond to cytoskeletal tension . We also tested if inhibition of YAP / TAZ occurs by entrapping YAP / TAZ in the cytoplasm or by promoting their nuclear exclusion . As shown in Supplementary Fig . 20a , blockade of nuclear export with leptomycin B rescued nuclear localization of YAP / TAZ in MSC treated with cytoskeletal inhibitors , indicating that YAP / TAZ keeps shuttling betweencytoplasm andnucleus irrespectively of celltension , and that the presence of a tense cytoskeleton promotes their nuclear retention . Moreover , YAP / TAZ relocalization was rapid ( occurring in as little as 30 min with latrunculin A ) , reversible after small - molecule washout ( Supplementary Fig . 20b ) , and insensitive to inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide ( data not shown ) , suggesting a direct biochemical mechanism . Mechanical cues act independently from Hippo YAP and TAZ are the nuclear transducers of the Hippo pathway 14 . In several organisms and cellular set - ups , activation of the Hippo path - way leads to YAP / TAZ phosphorylation on specific serine residues ; in turn , these phosphorylations inhibit YAP / TAZ activity through mul - tiple mechanisms , including proteasomal degradation 14 . Intriguingly , similar to Hippo activation by cell – cell contacts ( Fig . 3a ) , TAZ protein was also degraded by growing MEC on soft matrices ( Fig . 3b ) or by treatment with inhibitors of Rho , F - actin and actomyosin tension ( Fig . 3c and Supplementary Fig . 21 ) . Similar results were obtained with MSC and HMVEC ( Supplementary Fig . 22 and data not shown ) . Is then the Hippo cascade responsible for YAP / TAZ inhibition by mechanical cues ? Several evidences indicate this is not the case . First , we noted that phosphorylation of YAP on serine 127 , a key target of the LATS kinase downstream of the Hippo pathway 15 , was not increased upon treatment of MEC and MSC with cytoskeletal inhibi - tors ( Fig . 3c and Supplementary Fig . 22 ) , at difference with its regu - lation by high confluence ( see Fig . 3a ) . Second , depletion of LATS1 and LATS2 ( see Fig . 3f and Supplementary Fig . 23 for positive con - trols ) had marginal effect on YAP / TAZ inactivation by mechanical cues , as judged by ( 1 ) YAP / TAZ nuclear exit induced by micropat - terns or cytoskeletal inhibition in MEC , MSC or HMVEC ( Fig . 3d and Supplementary Figs 24 , 25 and data not shown ) ; ( 2 ) TAZ degradation ( Fig . 3e ) ; ( 3 ) endogenous target gene expression in cells plated on soft hydrogels ( Fig . 3f ) or treated with latrunculin A ( Supplementary Fig . 26 ) . Finally , we compared wild - type or LATS - insensitive 4SA 16 TAZ in MDA - MB - 231 depleted of endogenous YAP / TAZ and reconsti - tuted at near - to - endogenous YAP / TAZ activity levels with siRNA - insensitive mouse TAZ vectors . As shown in Fig . 3g , both wild - type and 4SA TAZ remain sensitive to mechanical cues . Further support - ing these results , we found that MDA - MB - 231 cells are homozygous mutant for NF2 ( also known as merlin , Supplementary Fig . 27 ) , an essential component of the Hippo cascade 14 . Collectively , these data indicatethatLATS phosphorylationdownstreamoftheHippocascade is not the primary mediator of mechanical / physical cues in regulating YAP / TAZ activity . We then asked if mechanical cues regulate YAP / TAZ not only in isolated cells , but also in confluent monolayers , when cells reorganize their shape and structure and engage in cell – cell contacts , leading to activation of Hippo / LATS signalling 11 . We first explored the effects of cellconfluence ina simplifiedexperimentalset - up , namelyinMCF10A cells rendered insensitive to Hippo activation by depletion of LATS1 / 2 ; inthese conditions , Rho and the cytoskeleton remainrelevantinputs to support TAZ stability ( Supplementary Fig . 28 ) . Moreover , in parental MCF10A , platingcells athighconfluencecooperatewithsofthydrogels in inhibiting YAP / TAZ activity ( Fig . 3h ) . Thus , mechanical cues and Hippo signalling represent two parallel inputs converging on YAP / TAZ regulation . YAP / TAZ mediate cellular mechanoresponses Data presented so far indicate YAP and TAZ as molecular ‘readers’ of ECMelasticityandcellgeometry , butareYAP / TAZrelevanttomediate the biological responses to these mechanical inputs ?

All rights reserved ©2011 cellular model to address this question are MSC , that can differentiate into osteoblasts when cultured on stiff ECM , mimicking the natural bone environment , whereas on soft ECM—or small islands—they dif - ferentiate into other lineages , such as adipocytes 5 , 6 . A similar case applies to endothelial cells , that respond differently to the same soluble growth factor by proliferating , differentiating or involuting according to the degree of cell spreading against the surrounding ECM 8 . We proposed that cell fates induced by stiff ECM and large islands ( that is , where YAP / TAZ are active ) should require YAP / TAZ function and , conversely , cell fates associated to soft ECM and small islands ( where YAP / TAZ are inhibited ) should require their inactivation . In line with this hypothesis , osteogenic differentiation induced in MSC on stiff ECM was inhibited upon depletion of YAP and TAZ , and a similar inhibition was achieved either by culturing cells on soft ECM or by incubation with C3 ( Fig . 4a , b ) . We also monitored adipogenic differ - entiation , a fate normally not allowed on stiff ECM ; strikingly , YAP / TAZ knockdown enabled adipogenic differentiation on stiff substrates , thus mimicking a soft environment ( Fig . 4c and Supplementary Fig . 30 ) . In the case of HMVEC , cells plated on small islands undergo apoptosis , whereas cells on bigger islands proliferate , as assayed by TdT - mediated dUTP nick end labelling ( TUNEL ) staining and 5 - bromodeoxyuridine ( BrdU ) incorporation , respectively 8 . Upon YAP / TAZ depletion , cells on bigger islands behaved as if they were on small islands ; this is overlapping with the biological effects of Rho inhibition ( Fig . 4d ) . In line with the Hippo independency of this regu - lation , knockdownofLATS1 / 2wasnotsufficienttorescueosteogenesis upon C3 treatment , or endothelial cell proliferation on small islands ( SupplementaryFig . 32 ) . Collectively , thesedatasuggestthatYAP / TAZ are required for cell differentiation triggered by changes in ECM stiff - ness and for geometric control of cell survival . We next tested if the sole YAP / TAZ activity can re - direct the bio - logical responses elicited by soft / confined ECM . Overexpression of activated 5SA - YAP ( ref . 14 ) with lentiviral infection ( to at least ten - fold the endogenous levels , data not shown ) remarkably overruled the geometric control over proliferation and apoptosis in HMVEC ( Fig . 4e ) , and rescued osteogenic differentiation of MSC treated with C3 or plated on soft ECM ( Fig . 4f , g ) . Thus , cells on soft matrices or on small adhesive areas can be ‘tricked’ to behave as if they were adhering on harder / larger substrates by sustaining YAP / TAZ function . Discussion In summary , our findings indicate a fundamental role of the transcrip - tional regulators YAP and TAZ as downstream elements in how cells perceivetheirphysicalmicroenvironment ( SupplementaryFig . 1 ) . Our data define an unprecedented modality of YAP / TAZ regulation , that acts in parallel to the NF2 / Hippo / LATS pathway , and instead requires Rho activity and the actomyosin cytoskeleton . Interestingly , this recapitulates aspects of MAL / SRF regulation 13 , but also entails pro - found differences : YAP / TAZ activity requires stress fibres and cyto - skeletal tension induced by ECM stiffness and cell spreading , but is not directly regulated by G - actin levels . The detailed biochemical mechanisms by which cytoskeletal tension regulates YAP / TAZ await further characterization , but it is tempting to speculate that stress - fibres inhibit an unidentified YAP / TAZ - antagonist . Functionally , we showed in different cellular models that cells read ECM elasticity , cell shape and cytoskeletal forces as levels of YAP / TAZ activity , such that experimental manipulations of YAP / TAZ levels can dictate cell beha - viour , overruling mechanical inputs . This identifies a new widespread transcriptional mechanism by which the mechanical properties of the ECM and cell geometry instruct cell behaviour . This may now shed light on how physical forces shape tissue morphogenesis and home - ostasis , for example in tissues undergoing constant remodelling upon variation of their mechanical environment ; indeed , alterations of YAP / TAZ signalling have been genetically linked in animal models to the emergence of cystic kidney , pulmonary emphysema , heart and vascular defects 17 – 20 . In cancer , changes in the ECM composition and mechanical properties is the focus of intense interest , as these have been correlated with progression and build - up of the metastatic niche 2 ; in light of their powerful oncogenic activities 14 , YAP / TAZ might serve as executers of these malignant programs . Genetically , YAP and TAZ have been linked to a universal system that controls organ size 14 . The current view implicates Hippo signal - ling as the sole determinant of YAP / TAZ regulation in tissues . However , our results suggest physical / mechanical inputs as alterna - tive determinants of YAP / TAZ activity . Supporting this view , it has been observed that growth of epithelial tissues entails the build - up of mechanical stresses at tissue boundaries 21 , and theoretical work pro - posed that these serve as positive feedback to homogenize cell growth , compensating for uneven activity of soluble growth factors 22 .

Fibronectin - coated hydrogels were synthesized according to ref . 24 . Micropost arrays were prepared according to ref . 25 , with microposts of 1 m m in diameter and 3 m m of centre - to - centre distance ; elasticity of the micropillars was changed by modulating the amount of cross - linker ( 10 % in the stiff micropillars , 5 % in the elastic ones ) and theirlength , asinref . 12 , toobtainnominalspringconstantsof . 10 . 9nN m m 2 1 for rigid micropillars , and 1 . 39nN m m 2 1 for the elastic ones . 5SA - YAP1 was sub - cloned into pCSII - EF - MCS to produce lentiviral particles . 4SA - mouse TAZ cDNA was synthesized ad hoc ( GeneScript ) . Cell lines , transfections and treatments . Mouse NMuMG cells were grown in DMEM 10 % FCS . Human MCF10A cells were grown in DMEM / F12 with 5 % horse serum freshly supplemented with insulin , epidermal growth factor , hydro - cortisone and cholera toxin . Human MDA - MB - 231 cells were grown in DMEM / F12 with 10 % FBS . Bone marrow - derived MSC and HMVEC - L were purchased from Lonza and grown according to the manufacturer’s instructions . siRNA transfections were done with Lipofectamine RNAi - MAX ( Invitrogen ) in antibio - tics - free medium according to manufacturer’s instructions . Sequences of siRNAs is provided in Supplementary Table 2 . DNA transfections were done with TransitLT1 ( Mirus Bio ) . Lentiviral particles were prepared by transiently trans - fecting HEK293T cells with lentiviral vectors together with packaging vectors ( pMD2 - VSVG and psPAX2 ) . Luciferase assays with the established YAP / TAZ - responsive reporter 4 3 GTIIC - lux 26 were as in ref . 27 , and displayed as arbitrary units . For hydrogels , 5 , 000 – 10 , 000cells per cm 2 were seeded in drop ; after attach - ment , the wells containing the hydrogels were filled with appropriate medium . MSC and mammary cells were plated in growth medium and harvested for immunofluorescence after 24h ; for luciferase and gene expression after 48h . For bone differentiation assays , growth medium was changed with osteogenic differentiation medium 24h after seeding , and renewed every 2days for a total of 8days of differentiation . Bone differentiation was assayed by alkaline phospha - tase staining ( Sigma 85L2 ) and quantified with ImageJ software as follows : for each sample , at least five low magnification ( 3 20 ) pictures were taken , and the alkaline - phosphatase - positiveareawasdeterminedwithImageJasthenumberof blue pixels across the picture ; this value was then normalized to the number of cells ( Hoechst / nuclei ) for each picture ( arbitrary units ) . For adipogenic differ - entiation , growth medium was replaced with adipogenic induction medium 24h after seeding ; cells were thensubjectedto cycles of 3daysof adipogenic induction and 1day of adipogenic maintenance until harvesting at day 7 of differentiation . Adipogenic differentiation was assayed by Oil Red staining ( Sigma ) and quan - tified as the Oil Red - positive area normalized to the number of cells ( Hoechst - positive nuclei ) in a manner similar to that described for bone differentiation . For micropatterns and micropost arrays , 40 , 000 HMVEC or MSC cells were plated in 35 - mm dishes in growth medium . For immunofluorescence , cells were fixed24hafterplating .

The projected cell area of cells on fibronectin - coated glass slidesand on microposts was determined with imageJ based on immunofluorescence pictures of cells stained with anti - YAP / TAZ ; the area of ECM contacted by cells was estimated by calculating that microposts ( diameter 1 m m ) arrayed in equilateral triangles ( centre - to - centre 3 m m ) approximate 10 % of the total surface covered by cells ( projected cell area ) . Fordrugtreatmentsandimmunofluorescence , 10 , 000cellspercm 2 wereplated onto 8 - well glass Lab - Tek chamberslides ( Nunc ) precoated for 1h at 37 u C with 20 m gml 2 1 bovine fibronectin ( Sigma ) in 1 3 PBS . Unless indicated otherwise , drug concentrations are indicated in the legend to Fig . 2a and d , and treatments lasted 4h for immunofluorescence , 6h for western blotting , and overnight for luciferase and gene expression assays . For serum stimulations , cells were incu - bated overnight without serum and then stimulated for 6h with 20 % serum ; for combined treatments , drugs were added together with 20 % serum . Antibodies , western blotting and immunofluorescence . Western blotting was carried out as in ref . 28 . Immunofluorescence was as in ref . 29 . Antibodies : anti - YAP / TAZ 1 : 200 for immunofluorescence ( sc101199 detecting both YAP and TAZ inwesternblot ) , anti - YAP1 : 100forimmunofluorescence ( sc271134detectingonly YAP inwestern blot , used in Supplementary Fig . 5 ) , anti - phosphoS127 - YAP ( CST 4911 ) , anti - LATS1 ( CST 3477 ) , anti - LATS2 ( Abnova ab70565 ) , anti - GAPDH ( Millipore mAb374 ) , anti - vinculin 30 , 31 ( VIN - 11 - 5 ) . Primary antibodies for immu - nofluorescence were incubated overnight in PBS with 0 . 1 % Triton and 2 % goat serum . Secondary antibodies were GAM Alexa488 , GAM Alexa568 and GAR Alexa555 ( Invitrogen ) . YOYO1 , TOTO3 ( Invitrogen ) or Hoechst were used in combination with RNase to counterstain nuclei . Alexa 488 - conjugated phalloidin ( Invitrogen ) was used 1 : 100 in 1 % BSA to visualize F - actin microfilaments . Firm - setting anti - fade mounting medium was 10 % Mowiol 4 - 88 , 2 . 5 % DABCO , 25 % glycerol , 0 . 1M Tris - HCl pH8 . 5 . Images were acquired with a Leica SP2 confocal microscope equipped with a CCD camera . Cells seeded on microposts were observed in 1 3 PBS with a Bio - Rad upright confocal microscope with water immersion long - range objectives . Pictures ofcells seeded onsmalladhesiveislands were rescaledtoallow better visualization ofimmunostainings . For quantifications of YAP / TAZ subcellular localizations , YAP / TAZ immunofluorescence signal was scored as predominantly nuclear versus evenly distributed / predominantly cyto - plasmic in 150 – 200 cells for each experimental condition . Real - time PCR . Cultures were harvested in TRIzol ( Invitrogen ) for total RNA extraction , and contaminant DNA was removed by DNase I treatment . cDNA synthesis was carried out with dT - primed MuMLV Reverse Transcriptase ( Invitrogen ) .

Expression levels are given rela - tive to GAPDH . Sequences of primers are provided in Supplementary Table 3 . Biostatistical analysis . The statistical association between genes differentially expressed in mammary epithelial cells ( MEC ) cultivated on ECM of high / low stiffness ( stiffness signature ) and belonging to signal transduction pathways is assessed by an over - representation analysis approach using Fisher’s exact test . Briefly , considering that there are S single - symbol - annotated genes on the stiff - ness signature , the over - representation of a pre - defined pathway signature is calculated as the hypergeometric probability of having a genes for a specific pathwayin S , under thenull hypothesis that they were picked outrandomlyfrom the N total genes of the microarray . Over - representation analysis has been con - ducted using one - sided Fisher’s exact test ( phyper function of R stats package ; P - value , 0 . 05 ) and considering 19 , 621 single - symbol - annotated genes on the HG - U133Plus2 . 0microarray . P - valueshavebeenadjustedforfalsediscoveryrate ( p . adjust function of R stats package ; FDR , 5 % ) . The stiffness signature has been derived from Supplementary Table 1 of ref . 9 . Thecompletesignaturecontains1 , 236probesetsoftheAffymetrix4302 . 0mouse array accounting for 1 , 015 single - symbol - annotated . MOE430 Plus2 . 0 probe IDs have been converted to the correspondent HG - U133 Plus2 . 0 probe sets using the NetAffxorthologue annotation file derivedfromtheNCBIHomologoGenedata - base ( MOE430A Orthologues / Homologues Release 30 , http : / / www . affymetrix . com / ) . This conversion table allows mapping orthologous probe sets ( that is , probe sets interrogating transcripts from orthologous genes ) across two Affymetrix types of arrays . The 1 , 236 mouse probe sets of the stiffness signature wereconvertedinto1 , 793humanprobesetscorrespondingto807single - symbol - annotated genes . Similarly , probe sets of all pathway signatures have been first converted into HG - U133Plus2 . 0 probe sets , and then annotated as gene symbols using Bioconductor hgu133plus2 . db package ( release 2 . 3 . 5 ) . Gene - sets of specific signalling pathways have been derived from : TGF b a 32 ; TGF b b 33 ; H - Ras and b - catenin 34 ; ERBB2 35 ; YAP 36 – 38 ; YAP / TAZ 39 ; WNT 40 ; Notch and NICD 41 .
