The cardinal feature of DHF / DSS , the severe form of DEN infection , is increased vascular permeability . To develop a murine model that is more relevant to DHF / DSS , a novel DEN strain , D2S10 , was generated by alternately passaging a non - mouse - adapted DEN strain between mosquito cells and mice , thereby mimicking the natural transmission cycle of the virus between mosquitoes and humans . After infection with D2S10 , mice lacking interferon receptors died early without manifesting signs of paralysis , carried infectious virus in both non - neuronal and neuronal tissues , and exhibited signs of increased vascular permeability . In contrast , mice infected with the parental DEN strain developed paralysis at late times after infection , contained detectable levels of virus only in the central nervous system , and displayed normal vascular permeability . In the mice infected with D2S10 , but not the parental DEN strain , signiﬁcant levels of serum tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF - (cid:1) ) were produced , and the neutralization of TNF - (cid:1) activity prevented early death of D2S10 - infected mice . Sequence analysis comparing D2S10 to its parental strain implicated a con - served region of amino acid residues in the envelope protein as a possible source for the D2S10 phenotype . These results demonstrate that D2S10 causes a more relevant disease in mice and that TNF - (cid:1) may be one of several key mediators of severe DEN - induced disease in mice . This report represents a signiﬁcant advance in animal models for severe DEN disease , and it begins to provide mechanistic insights into DEN - induced disease in vivo . Dengue virus ( DEN ) causes dengue fever ( DF ) and dengue hemorrhagic fever / dengue shock syndrome ( DHF / DSS ) , with an estimated 2 . 5 billion people at risk for infection in subtrop - ical and tropical regions of the world ( 6 ) . DEN is a positive - sense , single - stranded RNA virus that belongs to the family Flaviviridae and the genus Flavivirus , which includes yellow fever ( YFV ) , West Nile , Japanese encephalitis , and St . Louis encephalitis viruses . Primary infection with any one of the four DEN serotypes typically leads to DF , a debilitating but self - limited acute febrile illness . However , some primary infections and a larger percentage of secondary infections with a different serotype result in the severe , life - threatening DHF / DSS , char - acterized by increased vascular permeability and hemorrhagic manifestations ( 6 ) . Despite its name , bleeding manifestations are minor and major hemorrhages are unusual ; instead , in - creased vascular permeability is the hallmark of DHF / DSS . In rare cases of DHF / DSS , neurologic abnormalities , includ - ing encephalitis , may also occur ( 32 ) . DEN is transmitted to humans by the mosquitoes Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopic - tus . Due to uncontrolled urbanization , globalization , and dissemination of DEN - transmitting mosquitoes , the fre - quency of DEN epidemics has increased and DHF / DSS has spread ( 22 ) . Currently , DEN is a major public health prob - lem throughout the world , yet DEN - speciﬁc therapies and vaccines are unavailable . Despite global morbidity and mortality , DEN pathogenesis is poorly understood . Numerous studies suggest that DHF / DSS may be an immunopathogenic disease ( 11 , 18 , 27 , 28 ) . Speciﬁcally , epidemiologic studies have shown that secondary infection with a heterologous DEN serotype is a major risk factor for the development of DHF / DSS . Two non - mutually exclusive mechanisms have been proposed to explain how sec - ondary DEN infections may enhance disease severity . First , the ADE ( “antibody - dependent enhancement” ) hypothesis postu - lates that DEN serotype - cross - reactive antibodies ( Abs ) at non - neutralizing conditions contribute to DHF / DSS by in - creasing infection of Fc (cid:2) receptor - positive cells , such as monocytes and macrophages ( 5 , 12 ) , leading to an increase in viremia , which is correlated with more - severe disease ( 35 ) . Second , the “aberrant T - cell response” hypothesis pro - poses that the reactivation of serotype - cross - reactive mem - ory T cells during secondary infection results in abnormal T - cell activation and cytokine release or apoptosis ( 25 , 27 ) . At present , the exact mechanisms by which either the ADE phenomenon or inappropriate cellular immune response contributes to DHF / DSS are undeﬁned . Besides the host immune status , DEN strains themselves may inﬂuence the * Corresponding author .

Taken together , accumulating evidence implies that both viral and host factors contribute to DEN pathogenesis . Although clinical and experimental observations in vitro have provided valuable insights into DEN - host interactions , the roles of viral and host factors in regulating DEN - induced disease in vivo are yet to be elucidated . In particular , the mechanisms by which DEN infection leads to increased vascu - lar permeability , the cardinal feature of DHF / DSS and the cause of shock , remain unclear , and this is mainly due to the lack of a suitable animal model . Therefore , as a ﬁrst step towards investigating the molecular basis of DEN - induced dis - ease , the present work seeks to develop a murine model of DEN disease that better reﬂects the human disease . Unlike existing murine models in which paralysis is the dominant clinical phenotype , here we report a mouse model of DEN disease in which the infected animals exhibit increased vascular permeability and fatal non - neurological disease . MATERIALS AND METHODS Mice . 129 / Sv mice doubly deﬁcient in alpha / beta interferon ( IFN - (cid:2) / (cid:3) ) and IFN - (cid:4) receptors ( AG129 ) were obtained from Herbert Virgin ( Washington University School of Medicine , St . Louis , MO ) . They were bred and maintained under speciﬁc - pathogen - free conditions at the animal facility at the University of California , Berkeley ( UC Berkeley ) or at the La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology ( LIAI ) . All experiments were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at UC Berkeley and the Animal Care Committee at LIAI . Age - and sex - matched mice 5 to 6 weeks of age were used , and experimental groups contained three to six animals . Tissue culture and viruses . All reagents for tissue culture were endotoxin low , and cell lines were routinely tested for mycoplasma contamination . The parental PL046 DEN virus ( Taiwanese isolate ; Aedes albopictus C6 / 36 cell culture adapted ) was originally obtained from Huan - Yao Lei ( National Cheng Kung University , Taiwan ) . Stocks of PL046 were ampliﬁed in C6 / 36 cells , concentrated via ultracentrifugation , and titrated by plaque assays using BHK - 21 cells , as previously described ( 29 ) . To generate D2S10 , a single AG129 mouse was intra - venously injected with 10 8 PFU of PL046 , followed by harvesting of serum at day 3 postinfection ( d3 p . i . ) . The mouse was euthanized by isoﬂurane inhalation just prior to obtaining whole blood via cardiac puncture . The virus in the serum was ampliﬁed in C6 / 36 cells for 7 days and concentrated by ultracentrifugation , and approximately 10 5 to 10 6 PFU of the C6 / 36 cell - ampliﬁed virus was intravenously injected into another naive AG129 mouse . This entire procedure was repeated 10 times to obtain D2S10 stocks . To generate a sufﬁcient quantity of virus for performing all of the experiments in this study , the D2S10 stock was passaged one or two more times in C6 / 36 cells . For some control experiments , D2S10 was inactivated by UV irradiation at 320 nm for 20 min at a distance of 5 cm . All virus preparations used for these studies were concentrated 30 - to 50 - fold by ultracentrifugation ( starting volume , 60 to 100 ml ; ending volume , 1 to 2 ml ) , and the titers of the centrifuged virus were determined after one freeze - thaw cycle at (cid:5) 80°C . Quantitation of virus in infected mice . Mice were euthanized by isoﬂurane inhalation , and blood was collected after cardiac puncture for isolation of serum . Mice were then perfused with 30 to 50 ml phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) , and tissue samples were harvested , processed , and tested for the presence of infec - tious virus by plaque assay in BHK - 21 cells , as previously described ( 29 ) . The limit of the sensitivity of the plaque assay was 100 PFU / ml or g of tissue weight . Quantitation of vascular permeability . Vascular leakage was examined by intravascular administration of Evans blue ( Sigma - Aldrich ) as described previ - ously ( 34 ) . In brief , Evans blue ( 0 . 2 ml of 0 . 5 % solution in PBS ) was injected intravenously into PL046 - or D2S10 - infected mice between d3 to d4 p . i . , when D2S10 - infected mice began to exhibit signs of illness , such as rufﬂed fur , hunched posture , and lethargy . After 2 h , the mice were euthanized and extensively perfused with PBS , and then tissues were harvested and placed into preweighed tubes containing formamide ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . Samples were incubated at 37°C for 24 h , and then Evans blue concentrations in formamide extracts were quan - titated by measuring absorbances at 610 nm . Data were expressed as optical density at 610 nm per g of tissue weight . Histopathology . For histologic studies , mice were euthanized and tissues were immediately harvested and ﬁxed in 10 % buffered formalin . Fixed tissues were parafﬁn embedded , sectioned , and stained with hematoxylin and eosin by the BioPathology Sciences , South San Francisco , Calif . Measurement of TNF - (cid:1) . A standard sandwich enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) was performed to quantitate the levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF - (cid:2) ) in the serum and supernatants of tissue homogenates . A mouse TNF - (cid:2) ELISA Ready - SET - Go kit ( eBioscience ) was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions . The optical density at 450 nm of each sample was measured using a Bio - Tek El x 808 microplate reader ( Bio - Tek Instruments ) and KCjunior software ( Bio - Tek Instruments ) . TNF - (cid:2) levels were expressed as the number of picograms per ml or g of tissue weight . The limit of detection of TNF - (cid:2) was 15 pg / ml . Neutralization of TNF - (cid:1) . TNF - (cid:2) in D2S10 - infected mice was depleted by intraperitoneally injecting 100 (cid:6) g of puriﬁed , functional grade ( i . e . , azide - free , sterile - ﬁltered , and with endotoxin levels of (cid:7) 0 . 001 ng / (cid:6) g ) anti - mouse TNF - (cid:2) ( clone MP6 - XT3 ; eBioscience ) on d1 , d2 , and d3 p . i . Control animals were treated with functional grade , puriﬁed rat immunoglobulin G1 isotype control ( eBioscience ) . Nucleotide sequence analysis . Viral RNA was isolated using an RNeasy Mini kit ( QIAGEN ) , and the genome was ampliﬁed by real - time reverse transcription ( RT ) - PCR with previously described primers ( 9 ) using SuperScript III and high - ﬁdelity Pfu Turbo polymerase ( Invitrogen ) . Automated sequencing was per - formed at the UC Berkeley sequencing facility . For determination of consensus FIG . 1 . Susceptibility of AG129 mice to infection with DEN2 strain D2S10 or PL046 .

Two independent experiments per virus stock ( starting with RNA isolation ) were conducted to exclude the contribution of real - time RT - PCR artifacts . Sequences were evaluated using 4Peaks software ( http : / / mekentosj . com / 4peaks / ) , and sequence assembly and analysis were performed using Gene Jockey II ( Biosoft ) . For sequence analysis of individual clones , fragments cor - responding to amino acid residues 92 to 283 of domain II of the envelope ( E ) protein were PCR ampliﬁed , cloned into pCR2 . 1 - Topo vector ( Invitrogen ) , and ampliﬁed in DH5 (cid:2) competent cells . A total of 34 PL046 and 43 D2S10 clones were sequenced . Statistical analysis . All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism software , version 4 . 0a ( GraphPad Prism ) . Kaplan - Meier survival curves were analyzed by the log rank test . For viral burden analysis , an unpaired t test with Welch’s correction was used . To examine the vascular permeability and TNF - (cid:2) levels , one - way analysis of variance with Tukey’s multiple comparison test was performed . Values were considered signiﬁcant at a P of (cid:7) 0 . 05 . RESULTS D2S10 is a highly virulent DEN strain that causes a fatal non - neurological disease in mice . As part of our ongoing ef - forts towards developing a murine model of DEN disease that is more relevant to human illness , we generated a new DEN strain by alternately passaging a non - mouse - adapted DEN strain between mosquito cells and mice . Speciﬁcally , PL046 , a Taiwanese DEN serotype 2 ( DEN2 ) human isolate that is mosquito cell culture adapted , was intravenously injected into doubly deﬁcient 129 / Sv mice lacking receptors for IFN - (cid:2) / (cid:3) and IFN - (cid:4) ( Ifnar1 (cid:5) / (cid:5) and Ifngr1 (cid:5) / (cid:5) ; hereafter referred to as AG129 mice ) , followed by the harvest of serum on d3 p . i . Virus in the serum was ampliﬁed in mosquito cells and then intra - venously injected into another AG129 mouse . After repeating this process a total of 10 times , we obtained strain D2S10 . At 10 7 PFU , D2S10 caused a lethal infection in AG129 mice between d3 to d5 p . i . ( Fig . 1A ) , although it did not establish infection in wild - type mice ( data not shown ) . The infected AG129 mice exhibited hunched posture , rufﬂed fur , and leth - argy , but no paralysis . This phenotype was unchanged by the treatment of D2S10 - infected AG129 mice with sulfamethox - azole / trimethoprim antibiotic suspension ( 200 mg / 40 mg / 5 ml added to drinking water immediately after infection ) , eliminat - ing the possibility that the observed phenotype was due to bacterial sepsis and supporting a direct role for the virus in causing disease . Only 5 % of D2S10 - infected AG129 mice re - mained healthy at d5 p . i . , and all of them succumbed to infec - tion by d14 p . i . In contrast , AG129 mice that were infected with the parental DEN2 PL046 strain did not show any signs of illness except for paralysis starting at d14 p . i . Approximately 14 % of PL046 - infected mice remained free from disease until the end of the experiments at d30 p . i . As expected , the para - lytic mice harbored infectious virus only in the brain and spinal cord , whereas the moribund D2S10 - infected mice contained infectious DEN in both neuronal and non - neuronal tissues , including the serum , liver , lymph node , and spleen ( Fig . 1B ) . To conﬁrm that the D2S10 - induced phenotype was due to the virus and not other factors in the inoculum , mice were infected with D2S10 that was treated with neutralizing anti - DEN2 FIG . 2 .

Mice infected with 3H5 - neutralized D2S10 began to develop paralysis start - ing at d20 p . i . ; in contrast , mice that were infected with non - neutralized D2S10 ( 10 7 PFU ) died by d5 p . i . without paralysis . At a lower viral dose ( 10 6 PFU ) , D2S10 did not cause a lethal infection in AG129 mice ; instead , D2S10 - infected AG129 mice manifested paralysis at a signiﬁcantly faster rate than did PL046 - infected animals and contained detectable levels of DEN only in the brain and spinal cord ( data not shown ) . These results indicate that D2S10 is more virulent than PL046 in vivo and can cause a nonparalytic lethal disease in mice . To begin to understand D2S10 - induced disease , the levels of infectious virus were examined in AG129 mice 3 days after infection with 10 7 PFU of D2S10 or PL046 . At this time point , the majority of D2S10 - infected mice were alive and were be - ginning to display rufﬂed fur , hunched posture , and lethargy , whereas PL046 - infected mice appeared completely healthy . Both D2S10 - and PL046 - infected mice contained infectious virus in several tissues such as the serum , spleen , and large intestine ( Fig . 2 ) . Differences in viral titers between D2S10 - and PL046 - infected mice , as measured by plaque assay , were not statistically signiﬁcant . Approximately 3 to 10 times more viral RNA was present per PFU of D2S10 than per PFU of PL046 ( data not shown ) ; however , mice that were infected with 10 8 PFU of PL046 developed only paralysis ( 30 , 31 ) , indicating that injection of mice with higher PL046 viral copy numbers does not convert the paralytic phenotype into a more lethal , D2S10 - like disease . D2S10 induces increased vascular permeability in mice . The presence of the fatal non - neurologic disease in D2S10 - infected AG129 mice suggested that D2S10 might cause a phenotype in these mice more relevant to the human disease . Therefore , we asked whether D2S10 induced increased vascular permeability , the key feature of severe DEN infection in humans . To assess the integrity of the vascular endothelial barrier , DEN - infected AG129 mice were intravenously injected with Evans blue , a dye that preferentially binds to proteins such as albumin , and the extravasation of the dye into tissues was quantitated spec - trophotometrically . Between d3 to d4 p . i . , when all D2S10 - infected mice exhibited clinical signs of illness but none of the animals inoculated with PL046 or UV - irradiated D2S10 were ill , D2S10 - infected mice had signiﬁcantly higher amounts of Evans blue in the small intestine , large intestine , liver , and spleen than did the other two groups ( Fig . 3 ) . Tissues such as the lungs , lymph nodes , brains , and spinal cords of D2S10 - infected mice contained low levels of Evans blue , similar to control animals injected with PL046 or UV - irradiated D2S10 ( data not shown ) . These data indicate that D2S10 , but not PL046 or UV - irradiated D2S10 , induces increased vascular permeability in certain tissues of the infected mice . To assess vascular leakage in D2S10 - infected AG129 mice further , we next performed histologic analysis by examining FIG . 3 . Vascular leakage in tissues of D2S10 - infected AG129 mice . AG129 mice were intravenously inoculated with 10 7 PFU of D2S10 ( hatched bar ) , PL046 ( black bar ) , or UV - irradiated D2S10 ( white bar ) . At d3 p . i . , when D2S10 - infected mice began to exhibit clinical signs of illness , mice were administered intravenous Evans blue ( 0 . 2 ml of 0 . 5 % in PBS per mouse ) . After 2 h , mice were euthanized and ﬂushed extensively with PBS , and then tissues were harvested . Evans blue concentrations were quantiﬁed after formamide extraction by measuring absorbance at 610 nm . Data are expressed as means (cid:9) standard deviations of Evans blue optical density / g of wet tissue and are pooled from two to three independent experiments . Total numbers of mice per group are as follows : 14 for D2S10 , 11 for PL046 , and 4 for UV - D2S10 .

Samples from PL046 - infected mice demonstrated normal liver , spleen , and intestine histology ; in contrast , sections of all three tissues from D2S10 - infected mice revealed damage at the cellular and tissue levels ( Fig . 4 ) . Spe - ciﬁcally , in D2S10 - infected mice , ( i ) liver sections contained inﬂammatory inﬁltrates in the portal triad and hepatocytes that were dilated and multivesicular , with a vacuolated appearance ( Fig . 4A ) , ( ii ) spleen sections showed mononuclear cell inﬁl - trates and dead cells ( Fig . 4B ) , and ( iii ) samples throughout the intestinal tract revealed cellular debris in the lumen , de - struction of the columnar epithelium , and a thickening of the mucosal layer due to the presence of inﬂammatory cells ( Fig . 4C ) . These histologic ﬁndings provide evidence for patholog - ical changes in the tissues that exhibit signs of increased vas - cular permeability in D2S10 - infected mice , and they suggest an association between inﬂammatory inﬁltrates and interstitial leakage . Taken together , the Evans blue data and histopatho - logic observations support the conclusion that D2S10 - infected AG129 mice manifest increased vascular permeability , a hall - mark of DHF / DSS . Neutralization of TNF - (cid:1) in AG129 mice prevents D2S10 - induced early lethality . The presence of inﬂammatory inﬁl - trates in tissues of D2S10 - infected AG129 mice suggested a role for inﬂammatory responses in causing D2S10 - induced pa - thology and the early deaths of infected mice . Indeed , numer - ous human studies have suggested that proinﬂammatory cyto - kines may be involved in the pathogenesis of DHF / DSS . In particular , TNF - (cid:2) has been detected more frequently and at higher levels in the serum of patients with DHF / DSS than in those with DF ( 10 , 13 , 17 ) . Therefore , we investigated whether TNF - (cid:2) may be responsible for causing D2S10 - induced death by measuring TNF - (cid:2) levels in AG129 mice that had been injected with 10 7 PFU of D2S10 or PL046 by ELISA . On d1 and d2 p . i . , little or no TNF - (cid:2) was detected in the serum of PL046 - infected mice , whereas small amounts of this cytokine were observed in the serum of D2S10 - infected mice ( Fig . 5A ) . By d3 p . i . , signiﬁcantly higher levels of TNF - (cid:2) were present in the serum and supernatants of intestinal tract homogenates of FIG . 5 . TNF - (cid:2) production in D2S10 - infected AG129 mice . AG129 mice were inoculated with 10 7 PFU of D2S10 ( hatched bars ) , PL046 ( black bars ) , or UV - irradiated D2S10 ( white bars ) and sacriﬁced on d1 , d2 , or d3 p . i .

Next , D2S10 - infected AG129 mice were administered 100 (cid:6) g of anti - mouse TNF - (cid:2) or isotype control Ab intraperitone - ally on d1 , d2 , and d3 p . i . Neutralization of TNF - (cid:2) binding and biological activity signiﬁcantly prevented the lethal infection between d3 and d5 p . i . and instead resulted in the development of paralysis at later time points p . i . ( Fig . 6 ) . As expected , the isotype control Ab - treated group died early after infection , without exhibiting signs of paralysis . These results demonstrate that TNF - (cid:2) is responsible for causing early lethality in AG129 mice with D2S10 infection . Molecular analysis of D2S10 . To identify viral determinants responsible for this TNF - (cid:2) - induced early lethality , consensus sequence analysis was performed on cDNA derived from the RNA genomes of the parental virus and D2S10 . Seven nucle - otide changes occurred between PL046 and D2S10 coding regions , with one of these resulting in an amino acid substitu - tion ( Lys to Glu ) at position 128 within domain II of the major envelope glycoprotein E ( Table 1 ) . Only one nucleotide change at position 10 , 564 was identiﬁed within the untranslated regions ( UTR ) of the two viruses . Further examination of the primary sequencing ﬁles suggested that the region surrounding the E protein residue 128 in D2S10 might be more heterogeneous than in PL046 . Therefore , 30 to 40 clones of this particular segment of either D2S10 or PL046 was ampliﬁed by real - time RT - PCR , cloned into a Topo vector , and sequenced . Table 2 shows that 27 out of 34 clones derived from the parental virus matched the consensus PL046 amino acid sequence , and only 7 out of 34 clones differed at amino acid positions 150 , 153 , or 173 of the E protein . In contrast , the same region within the E protein of D2S10 contained a higher frequency of amino acid substitutions . All 43 clones contained a charge change mutation , and changes at eight residues were found in D2S10 : 122 ( Lys 3 Ile ) , 124 ( Asn 3 Asp / Ile ) , 126 ( Lys 3 Glu ) , 128 ( Lys 3 Glu ) , 130 ( Val 3 Met ) , 222 ( Pro 3 Ala ) , 228 ( Gly 3 Glu ) , and 229 ( Ser 3 Leu ) ( Table 3 ) . Based on the published DEN2 E protein structure , these residues in PL046 formed part of a basic patch on the external surface of the protein at the base of domain II , near the region postulated to affect fusion activity ( 23 , 26 ) . These positively charged residues , which have been identiﬁed in other DEN2 strains and speculated to bind heparan sulfate ( 24 ) , be - came more negatively charged amino acids in D2S10 . These ob - servations suggest that the DEN2 E protein , especially the basic patch on domain II , may be an important site for mutations that enhance virulence in vivo . DISCUSSION Due to the lack of an appropriate animal model , fundamen - tal questions remain unresolved regarding the role of viral and host factors that contribute to the pathogenesis of human DEN infection . Therefore , the major objective of this study was to FIG . 6 . Survival of D2S10 - infected AG129 mice after treatment with anti - TNF - (cid:2) . AG129 mice were inoculated with 10 7 PFU of D2S10 , followed by the intraperitoneal injection of anti - TNF - (cid:2) or isotype control Ab on days 1 , 2 , and 3 after infection . Infected mice were followed daily for lethality or paralysis . All isotype control - treated mice succumbed to infection without exhibiting signs of paral - ysis , whereas all anti - TNF - (cid:2) - injected mice developed paralysis . As per our animal protocol , mice with paralysis were immediately euthanized . The paralyzed mice were scored as death for Kaplan - Meier survival curve analysis . Data were pooled from three separate experiments ; n , total number of mice per group ; the P value is indicated . TABLE 1 .

A non - mouse - adapted DEN strain was alternately passaged between mosquito cells and non - neuronal tissues of mice for several rounds to obtain D2S10 , a novel DEN strain . Our studies demonstrated that D2S10 was more virulent than the parental strain in mice lacking IFN receptors , causing a lethal but nonparalytic disease in the infected mice . Perme - ability assays revealed that D2S10 induced increased vascular permeability in several tissues of the infected mice . Immuno - logic analyses indicated that D2S10 - infected mice had high levels of TNF - (cid:2) in circulation , and treatment of the infected mice with a neutralizing anti - TNF - (cid:2) Ab prevented early D2S10 - induced lethality . Finally , sequence comparisons between D2S10 and the parental DEN strain revealed amino acid charge differ - ences in a conserved region of the E gene , suggesting a role for these particular residues in determining viral virulence and patho - genesis in vivo . Based on these results , D2S10 - infected mice rep - resent a more relevant animal model of DEN - induced disease . Moreover , the identiﬁcation of TNF - (cid:2) as a key mediator of D2S10 - induced disease in mice and the association of viral viru - lence in vivo with speciﬁc amino acid substitutions in the E pro - tein set the foundation for studying the cellular and molecular basis of severe DEN disease in vivo . Previous studies have shown that sequential series of liver - to - liver passages of YFVs in hamsters led to the generation of viral strains that cause a more lethal disease in hamsters ( 21 , 33 , 39 ) . Instead of serial passaging , we performed alternate passaging of DEN between mosquito cells and mice to obtain D2S10 , thereby approximating the natural transmission cycle of DEN between mosquitoes and humans . Similar to hamster - passaged YFV , D2S10 was more virulent than the parental PL046 strain , based on the observations that in AG129 mice , ( i ) high doses of D2S10 , but not PL046 , caused a lethal infec - tion within 3 to 5 days p . i . and ( ii ) lower doses of D2S10 induced paralysis more rapidly than did PL046 . Viral titers in tissues of D2S10 - infected mice , as determined by plaque assay , were not signiﬁcantly higher than in PL046 - infected mice . Ad - ditional methods , such as strand - speciﬁc real - time RT - PCR , are now required to assess the contribution of viral load in causing the D2S10 - induced phenotype . Several murine models for DEN - induced disease have been reported . They have been created using a variety of mouse strains , including AG129 ( 16 , 30 ) , A / J ( 15 , 29 ) , and SCID ( severe combined immunodeﬁcient ) mice that have been re - constituted with human cells ( 2 , 4 , 20 , 37 , 38 ) , infected with either mosquito cell culture - passaged DEN or mouse brain - adapted DEN . DEN - infected mice in the great majority of these models exhibited paralysis , and some the infected mice also developed thrombocytopenia . Of note , a recent model using the SCID - human cord blood cell chimeras and subcuta - neous inoculation of low - passage clinical isolates showed rel - evant signs , such as thrombocytopenia and erythema , without manifesting paralysis ( 4 ) . However , none of the existing mod - els include signs of increased vascular permeability . The car - dinal feature of DHF / DSS in humans is the breakdown of vascular integrity , as evidenced by ﬂuid accumulation in the pleural and peritoneal cavities . In D2S10 - infected mice , in - creased vascular permeability was observed in the liver , spleen , and intestine , as assessed by Evans blue extravasation . How - ever , the relevance of our model to human DEN disease is subject to several limitations . For example , the apparent lack of ﬂuid accumulation in pleural and peritoneal cavities of D2S10 - infected mice could be due to species differences in the pathogenesis of DEN disease . Alternatively , different manip - ulations of the virus and host components may be necessary to generate a more suitable murine model of DEN - induced vas - cular leakage . In particular , a mouse model that requires lower doses of virus and is less immunocompromised than AG129 mice might better reﬂect natural DEN infection in humans , since a high viral dose , in combination with a deﬁcient IFN - dependent immune response of AG129 mice , may trigger an aberrant antiviral response . Therefore , we have continued our passaging strategy using different virus and mouse strains and are currently searching for new DEN strains that cause a more relevant disease in wild - type mice . Speciﬁcally , we are attempt - ing to isolate novel DEN strains that induce DF signs , such as thrombocytopenia and erythema , in a majority of wild - type mice and DHF / DSS signs , such as increased vascular perme - ability , in a small subset of wild - type mice at later times p . i . Meanwhile , despite these limitations , D2S10 - infected AG129 mice provide the ﬁrst opportunity to investigate the pathogenic mechanism of vascular leakage during DEN infection in vivo . A major ﬁnding of this study is the identiﬁcation of TNF - (cid:2) as a critical component of D2S10 - induced lethality in AG129 mice . In agreement with studies demonstrating that the sera from patients with DHF / DSS contain greater levels of several proinﬂammatory cytokines , including TNF - (cid:2) , than sera from individuals with DF ( 10 , 13 , 17 ) , D2S10 - but not PL046 - in - fected AG129 mice contain elevated levels of TNF - (cid:2) in the serum . Neutralization of this cytokine alone was sufﬁcient to decrease the severity of disease in D2S10 - infected mice and to delay death signiﬁcantly . Our result is consistent with a previ - ous study that showed that anti - TNF - (cid:2) treatment decreased the rate of paralysis in BALB / c mice after infection with mouse brain - adapted DEN ( 3 ) . Therefore , among all the inﬂamma - tory mediators that have been implicated in the pathogenesis of human DEN disease , TNF - (cid:2) may be one of the major players that modulate the severity of disease . Future experi - ments , starting with the identiﬁcation of cellular sources and targets of TNF - (cid:2) , are now necessary to determine why this cytokine is produced in D2S10 - infected animals . Potential ex - planations for TNF - (cid:2) induction include higher viral loads and / or more intense inﬂammatory responses in particular tis - sues or at certain time points p . i . in D2S10 - infected mice com - pared to those in PL046 - infected mice . However , in prelimi - nary Evans blue uptake studies , anti - TNF - (cid:2) treatment appeared to result in a decrease in vascular permeability in the spleen but not in other tissues of D2S10 - infected mice ( data not shown ) , suggesting that different immune effector molecules may be re - sponsible for the breakdown of the vascular integrity in different tissues . Further studies with D2S10 - infected AG129 mice at both virologic and immunologic levels should allow us to dissect the mechanisms by which TNF - (cid:2) and other immune effectors mod - ulate the severity of DEN - induced disease in vivo . Finally , another major ﬁnding of the present study is the identiﬁcation of potential viral determinants that are likely to mediate the D2S10 - speciﬁc phenotype described above . At the consensus sequence level , the genomes of D2S10 and PL046 viruses varied by eight nucleotides , with only one amino acid change in domain II of the E protein and one nucleotide V OL . 80 , 2006 MOUSE MODEL FOR SEVERE DENGUE DISEASE 10215 on O c t obe r 15 , 2017 b y gue s t h tt p : / / j v i . a s m . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m substitution in the 3 (cid:8) UTR . In vivo selection led to greater nucleotide heterogeneity in the envelope region , based on se - quence analysis of clones that span the E protein of PL046 versus D2S10 . Consensus sequence analysis of the E region of early mouse passages of D2S10 revealed the amino acid change ( K128E ) in domain II of the E protein starting at passage 5 . Since the D2S10 - like phenotype was observed at passage 7 , but not at passages 5 and 6 , additional sequencing is now needed to determine whether passages 5 and 6 have less heterogeneity than passage 7 . We have also sequenced the entire genome of the virus isolated from mesenteric lymph nodes of a D2S10 - infected AG129 mouse . At the consensus level , the lymph node virus contains the expected K128E change plus another ( N124D ) mutation in the E protein . Col - lectively , our sequence data suggest that this K128E mutation in the E protein is stable . Since the E protein plays a major role in viral tropism ( 26 ) and the 3 (cid:8) UTR is involved in DEN translation and replication ( 1 , 14 ) , these particular mutations in the E protein and the 3 (cid:8) UTR may be involved in the increased virulence of D2S10 . Similarly , few nucleotide changes were asso - ciated with the serial passage of YFV in hamsters , and a majority of amino acid changes of the hamster - virulent YFV also occurred in the E protein ( 21 ) . Taken together , these ﬁndings suggest that , at the consensus sequence level , ﬂaviviruses accumulate few mu - tations in vivo and that these mutations tend to cluster in the E protein . However , within the E protein , the hamster - passaged YFV strain carried mutations in domains I and III , whereas D2S10 contained changes in domain II , suggesting different mechanism of action for the increased virulence of these viruses . Analysis of clones derived from domain II of the E protein of PL046 versus D2S10 implicated several potential mechanisms . First , all eight amino acid changes in D2S10 were localized near the region that is postulated to regulate fusion activity , suggesting a role for viral entry and fusion in D2S10 - induced virulence ( 23 ) . Second , these eight amino acids , which were part of a conserved , basic patch in PL046 , converted into negatively charged or un - charged residues in D2S10 , potentially disrupting normal interac - tions between the basic residues and cell surface components such as heparan sulfate ( 24 ) . Third , the viral diversity in D2S10 was increased compared to that in PL046 , and this might indicate a role for the viral population as a whole , as opposed to a speciﬁc viral variant , in modulating the D2S10 - induced phenotype in vivo ( 36 ) . Further studies using molecular clones of these viruses are now required to determine the signiﬁcance of the speciﬁc D2S10 mutations . Speciﬁcally , we have generated an infectious cDNA clone of PL046 and are currently engineering the particular D2S10 - speciﬁc mutations into the parental virus . In conclusion , inoculation of AG129 mice lacking IFN re - ceptors with D2S10 , a novel DEN strain that was isolated after alternate passaging between mosquito cells and mice , resulted in a TNF - (cid:2) - mediated lethal infection . Infected mice mani - fested increased vascular permeability and lacked signs of pa - ralysis early after infection . Sequence analysis of the parental and D2S10 viruses suggested that a conserved patch of basic residues in domain II of the E protein might be a major target for increasing viral virulence in vivo .
