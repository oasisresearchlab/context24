Although many studies have investigated the development of the arterial valves , it has been assumed that , as with the atrioventricular valves , endocardial to mesenchymal transition ( EndMT ) is the predominant mechanism . We show that arterial is distinctly different from atrioventricular valve formation . Whilst the four septal valve leaflets are dominated by NCC and EndMT - derived cells , the intercalated leaflets differentiate directly from Tnnt2 - Cre + / Isl1 + progenitors in the outflow wall , via a Notch - Jag dependent mechanism . Further , when this novel group of progenitors are disrupted , development of the intercalated leaflets is disrupted , resulting in leaflet dysplasia and bicuspid valves without raphe , most commonly affecting the aortic valve . This study thus overturns the dogma that heart valves are formed principally by EndMT , identifies a new source of valve interstitial cells , and provides a novel mechanism for causation of bicuspid aortic valves without raphe .

Together with stenosis of the aortic and pulmonary valves , BAV commonly accompa - nies other congenital cardiovascular malformations , for example , ventricular septal defects , double outlet right ventricle , hypoplastic left heart syndrome and aortic coarctation ( Siu and Silversides , 2010 ) . BAV is also associated with late onset aortopathy ( Tadros et al . , 2009 ) . These associations may reflect common developmental origins and / or abnormal haemodynamic forces , but little is known specifically about arterial ( semilunar ) valve development and mechanisms have been extrapo - lated from tricuspid and mitral ( atrioventricular ) valve development ( de Vlaming et al . , 2012 ) . Simi - larly , the pathogenesis of stenotic , dysplastic or bicuspid arterial valves remains obscure , although fusion of adjacent leaflets in fetal life , resulting in the presence of a raphe , is presumed to cause many cases of BAV . Over the past 20 years we have developed a good understanding of how the outflow tract devel - ops . Cells derived from the second heart field ( SHF ) make the major contribution to the outflow tract walls , forming myocardium in the proximal ventricular part , smooth muscle cells in the distal arterial Eley et al . eLife 2018 ; 7 : e34110 . DOI : https : / / doi . org / 10 . 7554 / eLife . 34110 1 of 27 RESEARCH ARTICLE walls , and also the inner endocardial lining ( Kelly et al . , 2014 ) . In the early unseptated outflow tract , peristaltic contraction propels blood forward and retrograde flow is prevented by occlusion of the heart tube lumen by voluminous cardiac jelly interposed between endothelium and contracting myo - cardium ( Nomura - Kitabayashi et al . , 2009 ) . As the outflow tract lengthens , the cardiac jelly becomes localised to discrete areas , endocardial cushions , which are the anlagen of the mature valve leaflets ( de Vlaming et al . , 2012 ; Phillips et al . , 2013 ) . These initially acellular endocardial cushions become populated with mesenchymal cells that give rise to the valve interstitial cells . A major source of cells in both atrioventricular and arterial valves is epithelial or endothelial to mesenchymal trans - formation ( EMT or EndMT ; [ Markwald et al . , 1977 ; Markwald et al . , 1978 ; de Vlaming et al . , 2012 ] ) . In addition , the main outflow tract cushions , that fuse to separate aortic and pulmonary blood flow and also give rise to the arterial valve leaflets , receive a major contribution of neural crest cells ( NCC ) that have migrated through the pharyngeal arches ( Kirby et al . , 1983 ; Waldo et al . , 1999 ; Jiang et al . , 2000 ; Jain et al . , 2011 ; Phillips et al . , 2013 ) . In contrast few NCC are seen in the atrioventricular valves . Smaller swellings located between the main superior and inferior outflow tract cushions , commonly called intercalated cushions ( IC ) , give rise to the remaining two leaflets ( Kramer , 1942 ; Anderson et al . , 2012 ; Sizarov et al . , 2012 ; Yang et al . , 2013 ) . We have previously shown that NCC are essential for positioning the main outflow tract endocardial cushions and pat - terning the arterial valve leaflets , but make only a minor contribution to these IC ( Phillips et al . , 2013 ) . More recently , we have also shown that the arterial roots ( Figure 1A ) that connect the ven - tricles with the great arteries and house the arterial valves , have a complex origin from both SHF - derived cells and NCC ( Richardson et al . , 2018 ) . However , the contribution of each lineage to the different valve leaflet primordia , and how these relationships affect normal and abnormal leaflet pat - terning including BAV , remains obscure . This study demonstrates how the arterial valve leaflets form and defines the origins of the cells that populate these leaflets . We show that despite the mature arterial valve leaflets appearing indis - tinguishable , the IC have an entirely distinct origin and underpinning developmental mechanisms from the major cushions , originating from a novel , direct SHF contribution that is independent of endMT . Results The intercalated cushions are morphologically distinct from the main outflow cushions Although the presence of the IC and their participation in arterial valve leaflet development is well - recognised ( Kramer , 1942 ) ( Figure 1B ) , their origin and composition have not been established . We therefore analysed their development from mouse embryonic day ( E ) 9 . 5 and human Carnegie stage ( CS ) 14 . At E9 . 5 , the outflow of the heart consists of a simple tube with an outer myocardial wall , an inner layer of endocardium and an intervening acellular space filled with cardiac jelly . There was no evidence of discrete main or intercalated cushions ( Figure 1C ) . By E10 . 5 the IC were first seen as anterior and posterior thickenings of the outflow tract outer wall , bulging into localised expansions of cardiac jelly heralding the main outflow tract cushions ( Figure 1D and Figure 1—figure supple - ment 1 ) . The IC were obvious at E11 . 5 as compact swellings within the distal outflow tract wall ( Figure 1E ) whilst rotation of the outflow tract ( Bajolle et al . , 2006 ) placed the aortic IC to the right and the pulmonary IC to the left . By E12 . 5 , all six primordia of the forming aortic and pulmonary valve leaflets appeared morphologically similar , although packing of cells in the forming IC appeared more dense ( Figure 1F ) . At E13 . 5 and E15 . 5 the leaflets were indistinguishable from each other using standard histological staining ( Figure 1G , H ) . These observations were confirmed in human embryos at equivalent developmental stages ( Figure 1I – L ) . Although of similar appearance , the pulmonary IC became evident earlier in development and was more discrete than the aortic IC at E10 . 5 - E11 . 5 . Moreover , the two IC were positioned at differ - ent levels within the outflow reflecting the orientations of the adult valve structures . Thus , the pul - monary IC sits more distally by E11 . 5 and is surrounded laterally by a cuff of outflow tract myocardium ( Figure 1M , P , R ) , whereas the larger aortic IC only has proximal contact with myocar - dium ( Figure 1N , Q , R ) . Importantly , both IC have distal continuity with undifferentiated ( non - myocar - dial ) outflow tract wall ( Figure 1O , Q and Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) .

( B ) Cartoon ( based on [ Kramer , 1942 ] ) illustrating how fusion of the main outflow cushions together with growth of the IC produces the three arterial valve primordia . ( C – H ) At E9 . 5 ( C ) , the outflow tract is a simple tube with an outer myocardium and inner endocardium , but with few cells in between . The arrow points to the region where the IC will appear , but there is no evidence of wall thickening at this stage . By E10 . 5 ( D ) , cells are seen in the cardiac jelly and IC appear as bulges in the outflow wall ( arrows ) . At E11 . 5 ( E ) , the IC ( arrows ) have expanded but are significantly smaller than the main outflow cushions . The posterior valve primordia ( arrows ) are well developed and appear similar to the right and left valve primordia at E12 . 5 - E13 . 5 ( F , G ) , although the cells appear more densely packed . By E15 . 5 ( H ) , the valve sinuses have formed and the leaflets are apparent . ( I – L ) IC are also apparent in stage matched ( CS14 - 16 ) human embryos and have a similar morphology to those seen in mouse at CS21 . ( M – Q ) The pulmonary IC ( labelled red by Isl1 in P ) is encased by a thin layer of cTnI - expressing ( green ) myocardium ( arrows in M , P ) , whereas the aortic IC is not ( N , Q ) . At E11 . 5 , the IC are in continuity with Isl1 - expressing cells in the pharyngeal region ( red in P , Q ) . ( O , R ) At E11 . 5 ( O ) , 3D reconstruction ( modified from those first presented in [ Anderson et al . , 2012 ] ) shows the non - myocardial component of the outflow ( dark green ) extends into the myocardial component ( light green ) . The IC form within these extensions ( arrows ) . At E12 . 5 , the pulmonary IC ( brown , see arrow ) is found more distally than the aortic IC ( green , see arrow ) .

To evaluate the tissue characteristics of these primordia we examined the expression of chondroitin sulphate , a component of both the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) of the car - diac jelly and valve primordia ( Markwald et al . , 1978 ) , using CS56 antibody . We also investigated expression of cardiac troponin I ( cTnI ) , a myocardial specific protein , to elucidate the relationships of the IC with the myocardial wall . At E10 . 5 cardiac jelly , labelled by CS56 antibody , was found in a cir - cumferential layer between the myocardium and endocardium , with laterally located accumulations of cells that prefigured the main cushions ( Figure 2A ) . Although the IC within the wall were not labelled by CS56 , a thin layer of CS56 - expressing cardiac jelly overlaid their luminal surface ( Figure 2D , G ) . The outflow tract wall labelled with cTnI antibody , but despite continuity with this wall , the IC did not express cTnI . At E11 . 5 , the main outflow tract cushions contained many cells and continued to strongly label with CS56 antibody ( Figure 2B ) . In contrast , although the IC had expanded , they remained devoid of labelling for cTnI or for CS56 , except for the thin layer of adlu - minal cardiac jelly ( arrowheads in Figure 2E ) . When examined at E12 . 5 , the main cushions and the IC labelled with the CS56 antibody ( Figure 2C , F , I ) . To further understand the differentiation of these IC we examined them for the expression of proteins relevant to endocardial cushion differentiation . Versican is a chondroitin sulphate proteoglycan that is expressed early and plays essential roles in cushion formation ( Henderson and Copp , 1998 ; Mjaatvedt et al . , 1998 ) . At E10 . 5 , Versican was only detected in the cardiac jelly of the main septal cushions and the thin layer of cardiac jelly overly - ing the IC . However , at E11 . 5 , prior to expression of CS56 , and also at E12 . 5 , Versican was expressed within the bulk of the IC ( Figure 2J – O ) . At E10 . 5 Sox9 , a transcription factor necessary for the formation of endocardial cushions and maintained in mature valve leaflets ( Akiyama et al . , 2004 ; Richardson et al . , 2018 ) , was abundantly expressed in the circumferential layer of cardiac jelly where the main cushions form , but only in the area immediately adjacent to the endothelium overly - ing the IC that was labelled by CS56 ( Figure 2P , S – compare to 2 D , G ) ; there was no Sox9 in the main part of the IC at this stage . At E11 . 5 Sox9 was also expressed throughout the IC and this was maintained at E12 . 5 ( Figure 2Q , R , T , U ) . Taken together , these findings indicate that at early stages the IC are overlaid by a layer of cardiac jelly but are not endocardial cushions in the classical sense . However , as they mature they express markers of valve interstitial cells . In view of this we henceforth refer to them in this manuscript as intercalated valve swellings ( ICVS ) as in Kramer’s original descrip - tion ( Kramer , 1942 ) . Undifferentiated SHF cells directly contribute to the ICVS We have previously shown that whilst NCC and EndMT - derived cells ( EDC ) make a major contribu - tion to valve primordia derived from the main outflow cushions at E11 . 5 and E12 . 5 , they make only a minor contribution to the laterally - placed IC ( Phillips et al . , 2013 ) . These patterns are highly repro - ducible ( n > 10 ) . More thorough analysis showed that the proportion of Wnt1 - Cre + lineage cells was significantly different between the valve primordia , X 2 ( df5 , N = 6842 ) = 959 . 4 , p < 0 . 0001 ( Figure 3— source data 1 ) . Pairwise chi - squared comparison , with Bonferroni correction for multiple testing , confirmed that the aortic posterior ( non - coronary ) and anterior pulmonary primordium were statisti - cally different from all other primordia ( for each , p < 0 . 0002 ) . Whereas the left aortic primordium was statistically different from the remaining primordia ( p < 0 . 02 ) , the aortic right , pulmonary left and pul - monary right were not significantly different with respect to the number of Wnt1 - Cre + lineage cells they contained . Chi squared analysis showed that the proportion of Tek - Cre lineage cells between the different arterial valve primordia were significantly different , X 2 ( df5 , N = 7389 ) = 782 . 3 , p < 0 . 0001 ( Figure 3—source data 1 ) . Pairwise Chi - squared comparison between the primordia , with Bonfer - roni correction for multiple testing , confirmed that the aortic non - coronary , the pulmonary right and the pulmonary anterior were not statistically different in the proportion of Tek - Cre + lineage cells Figure 1 continued The following figure supplement is available for figure 1 : Figure supplement 1 .

However , all the remaining primordia were statistically different ( p < 0 . 0002 ) . Thus , these data showed that there were marked variations in the NCC and EDC contributing to each leaf - let and confirmed that there were insufficient Wnt1 - Cre + and Tek - Cre + lineage traced cells to account for all the cells present in these valve primordia ( Figure 3A – F and Figure 3—figure supple - ment 1 ) . We therefore looked for alternative sources to explain the origins of the remaining cells in the developing arterial valve leaflets . As the parietal valves of the atrioventricular valves are known to contain epicardially - derived cells ( EPDC ; [ Gittenberger - de Groot et al . , 1998 ; Wessels et al . , 2012 ] ) . We asked whether EPDC could contribute to the ICVS or other outflow cushions . To test this , we performed tamoxifen induction in Wt1 - Cre - ERT2 mice starting at E9 . 5 . Analysis at E12 . 5 Figure 2 . IC are molecularly distinct from the main outflow cushions . In each case , arrows mark the IC . * mark the main outflow cushions . In D - U the myocardium is labelled with cTnI ( green ) . Images are typical examples from a minimum of n = 3 at each stage . ( A – C ) The cardiac jelly of the main outflow cushions contain chondroitin sulphate molecules , recognised by the antibody CS56 , from E10 . 5 to E12 . 5 , whereas these are only abundant in the IC at E12 . 5 . ( D – I ) Higher power of CS56 immunoreactivity shows that although the bulk of the IC stain with neither cTnI nor CS56 at E10 . 5 - E11 . 5 ( arrows ) , they are overlaid by a layer of CS56 - expressing material ( arrowheads in D , E , G ) that is continuity with the main outflow cushions . By E12 . 5 , the majority of the leaflet primordium is labelled by CS56 . ( J – O ) Versican is expressed in the cardiac jelly of the main cushions at E10 . 5 and the adluminal region overlying the IC ( arrowhead in J , M ) . Versican is not found in the bulk of the IC at E10 . 5 , ( J , M ) but is expressed more broadly in the IC at E11 . 5 and E12 . 5 . Notably , versican is missing from the centre part of both the aortic and pulmonary IC at E12 . 5 ( arrows in L , O ) . ( P – U ) Sox9 labels only the layer overlying the IC at E10 . 5 ( arrowheads in P , S ) but is expressed throughout the ICVS by E11 . 5 and at E12 . 5 .

Arrows mark the ICVS . * mark the main outflow cushions . Images are typical examples from a minimum of n = 3 at each stage . ( A – F ) NCC labelled by Wnt1 - Cre ( A , B ) make a significant contribution to the main outflow cushions and right and left valve primordia at E11 . 5 and E12 . 5 , but make only a minor contribution to the ICVS and anterior leaflets ( arrows ) . Tek - Cre labels cells in the endocardium ( arrow in C ) , but few cells in either the main cushions or ICVS at E11 . 5 ( C ) , although they are abundant in the left and right leaflets by E12 . 5 ( D ) . Quantification of cells at E12 . 5 ( E , F ) confirms these observations and reveals that there are a number of cells in the leaflets , particularly the anterior and posterior derived from the ICVS , that are not labelled by NCC or EDC ( data reanalysed from [ Phillips et al . , 2013 ] ) . ( G – J ) Wt1 - ERT - Cre labels the epicardium ( arrowheads in G ) but not cells in the ICVS ( arrows in G ) . The ICVS are labelled by Mef2c - AHF - Cre at E11 . 5 and E12 . 5 ( H , I ) , as are the main cushions and the left and right leaflet primordia . Quantification of these cells ( J ) shows that the Mef2c - AHF - Cre - expressing population is the major contributor to the leaflet primordia . ( K – N ) Cells expressing Tnnt2 - Cre label the cells in the ICVS at E11 . 5 ( arrows in K , L ) and the posterior valve leaflet primordia at E12 . 5 ( M ) . A few labelled cells are also seen in the left and right primordia . ( N ) Tnnt2 - Cre labels cells in all leaflets ( arrows ) of the aortic valve at P2 , although it is more abundant in the posterior leaflet . Tnnt2 - Cre also labels the walls of the aortic sinuses that are composed of SMC ( arrowhead ) . ( O , P ) Antibodies specific for cardiac troponin - T ( O ) , cTnI ( green in P ) and a SMA ( red in P ) label the outflow wall but not the ICVS at E11 . 5 . ( Q – V ) At E9 . 5 , a Tnnt2 - Cre - positive , but cTnT - negative region ( arrows in Q - S ) is apparent in the distal outflow wall . A similar region can be seen in transverse sections at E10 . 5 ( arrows in T - V ) . N . B . mTmG was used as the reporter line in Q - S so the GFP staining appears membrane associated in these sections . ( W – Y ) Some of the cells in the ICVS Figure 3 continued on next page Eley et al . eLife 2018 ; 7 : e34110 . DOI : https : / / doi . org / 10 . 7554 / eLife . 34110 6 of 27 Research article Developmental Biology showed that although the epicardium itself was strongly labelled , there was no contribution of EPDC into the forming arterial valve leaflets ( Figure 3G ) . The dorsal pericardial wall and the pharyngeal mesoderm are composed of SHF cells that directly generate the outflow tract myocardium , much of the smooth muscle and fibrous tissue in the proxi - mal and distal outflow vessel walls , and also the endocardium that lines these structures ( Waldo et al . , 2005 ; Harmon and Nakano , 2013 ; Verzi et al . , 2005 ; Richardson et al . , 2018 ) . Moreover , the SHF through endothelial EndMT , indirectly populates the outflow tract cushions ( Verzi et al . , 2005 ) ; Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ) . We wondered whether SHF progenitors might contribute to the ICVS , over and above those provided by EndMT . By lineage tracing using Mef2c - AHF - Cre , it was possible to identify all SHF - derived cells adding into the valve anlagen , either directly or through EndMT . Analysis at E11 . 5 and E12 . 5 revealed that cells derived from the Mef2c - AHF - Cre + SHF make a major and highly reproducible contribution to all of the arterial valve leaflet primordia , including the ICVS ( Figure 3H – J ) . Chi squared analysis following quantification of the Mef2c - AHF - Cre + lineage cells in the E12 . 5 leaflet primordia showed that the proportion of these cells were significantly different between the different arterial valve primordia , X 2 ( df5 , N = 7435 ) = 748 . 2 , p < 0 . 0001 ( Figure 3—source data 1 ) . Pairwise Chi - squared comparison between the primor - dia , with Bonferroni correction for multiple testing , confirmed that the aortic anterior ( non - coronary ) primordium was statistically different from all other primordia ( p < 0 . 0002 ) , as was the pulmonary pos - terior primordium ( p < 0 . 0002 ) . Moreover , whilst the right pulmonary primordium was statistically dif - ferent from the remaining primordia ( p < 0 . 02 ) ; the aortic left , aortic right and pulmonary left were not significantly different . Importantly , our analysis demonstrated that the numbers and distribution of Mef2c - AHF - Cre + lineage cells in the ICVS and in both the main cushions were complementary to the Wnt1 - Cre + lineage ( compare Figure 3J with 3E ) and were sufficient to explain the presence of all cells . Origin of ICVS directly from SHF progenitors in the outflow wall A possible source of the SHF - derived cells within the ICVS was trans - differentiation of outflow tract myocardium . To explore this , we carried out lineage tracing using the cardiomyocyte - specific Tropo - nin T - Cre ( cTnT ; Tnnt2 - Cre ) line . Analyses of the ICVS , both during formation at E11 . 5 and when they resemble the main cushions at E12 . 5 , showed that the ICVS and the adjacent outflow tract wall was indeed composed of cells demonstrating Tnnt2 - Cre + lineage ( Figure 3K – M ) . In addition to this major contribution of Tnnt2 - Cre + lineage cells to the ICVS at these stages , a few labelled cells were also found in the right and left leaflets derived from the main septal cushions , located within the outer parts of the leaflets , close to the myocardial wall . Examination of Tnnt2 - Cre ; eYFP embryos at later stages of development showed that the Tnnt2 - Cre + lineage cells were found in all three arterial valves throughout gestation and postnatally , although the majority were found in the anterior / poste - rior leaflets ; these data indicate that Tnnt2 - Cre + lineage cells make a permanent contribution to the valve leaflets ( Figure 3N ) . However , as shown earlier , the E11 . 5 ICVS did not contain differentiated cardiomyocytes , thus did not express cTnT , cTnI , nor a SMA , a smooth muscle cell ( SMC ) marker Figure 3 continued label co - express ( yellow ; arrows ) Isl1 and Sox9 antibody at E11 . 5 .

As the Cre lineage tracing indicated cells that not only currently expressed cTnT , but also those that were descended from cells that previously expressed cTnT , we used antibodies directed against cTnT / cTnI together with Tnnt2 - Cre lineage tracing at earlier stages of development , to establish whether cells in the ICVS ever expressed these markers . Despite their Tnnt2 - Cre + lineage labelling , the ICVS did not label with antibodies to cTnT nor cTnI at any stage of development . At E9 . 75 , before the ICVS could be seen in the distal outflow , a region of Tnnt2 - Cre + ; cTnT - labelling was seen , likely indicating where the ICVS would develop ( Figure 3Q – S ) . Similarly , At E10 . 5 the most distal outflow wall was Tnnt2 - Cre - expressing , but did not label with cTnT antibody ( Figure 3T – V ) . Thus , our data argue against trans - differentiation of ICVS cells from cardiomyocytes . To clarify the timing of Cre expression driven by the Tnnt2 promoter activity in the ICVS , we used an anti - Cre antibody . By examining embryos at E10 . 5 - E12 . 5 we showed that at E10 . 5 Cre protein was found in the forming ICVS and in the myocardial wall . However , by E11 . 5 , and continuing at E12 . 5 , Cre pro - tein was absent from the ICVS , although still maintained in the myocardial walls ( Figure 3—figure supplement 2 ) . Taken together these data indicate that Tnnt2 - Cre activation in the forming ICVS occurred prior to full differentiation to cardiomyocytes and taking into account perdurance of Cre protein , is likely to occur before E10 . 5 . Interestingly , Tnnt2 - Cre + lineage cells were also observed in SMC within the arterial wall later in development ( Figure 3N and ( Figure 3—figure supplement 3 ) . A key question is whether these ICVS cells originate directly from undifferentiated SHF cells . As they remain in continuity with the dorsal pericardial wall , we wondered if they might also have retained an undifferentiated state . Islet 1 ( Isl1 ) is a specific marker of multipotent SHF progenitors that are yet to differentiate into a broad range of cell types including cardiomyocytes ( Cai et al . , 2003 ) . At E11 . 5 the ICVS were clearly delineated within the distal outflow wall by Isl1 antibody ( Figure 3W , Y and Figure 3—figure supplement 4 ) ; co - localisation studies showed that some of the cells also expressed Sox9 and thus were directly differentiating into valve interstitial cells ( Figure 3W – Y and Figure 3—figure supplement 4 ) . By E12 . 5 , Isl1 expression had essentially disap - peared from the outflow tract , although persisting low level Isl1 expression was noted in a few cells in the ICVS ( Figure 3—figure supplement 4 ) . Thus , the cells within the ICVS , although of Tnnt2 - Cre + lineage , are formed from Mef2c - AHF - Cre - expressing SHF progenitor cells that maintain expres - sion of Isl1 for longer than the surrounding cells , suggesting they differentiate later . Co - expression of reducing Isl1 protein levels but increasing Sox9 protein levels , in the setting of absence of protein for differentiated cardiomyocyte markers , supports direct derivation of valve precursors from SHF , rather than trans - differentiation from myocardial wall . ICVS derive from SHF epithelium , but not through EMT We have previously shown how SHF progenitor cells from the dorsal pericardial wall add to the elon - gating outflow tract at E9 . 0 - E9 . 5 ( Ramsbottom et al . , 2014 ) and form the myocardium of the out - flow tract . As they do so they initially up - regulate E - cadherin and show marked cellular polarisation . As addition continues , they lose their epithelial phenotype , down - regulate Isl1 , and then express markers of differentiated cardiomyocytes in the segment of outflow tract we termed the transition zone ( Ramsbottom et al . , 2014 ) . E - cadherin was expressed throughout the distal outflow wall including the forming ICVS at E10 . 5 , ( Figure 4A – C ) but was not expressed in the main cushions . By E11 . 5 levels of E - cadherin expression were reduced in the ICVS ( Figure 4D – F ) and by E12 . 5 , E - cad - herin was absent ( Figure 4G – I ) . This was paralleled by b - catenin expression , which also labels epithe - lial cells , ( Figure 4J ) , but was entirely different from N - cadherin and fibroblast specific protein 1 ( Fsp1 ) immuno labelling , both of which are markers of mesenchymal cells . Specifically , neither N - cad - herin nor Fsp1 were expressed in the ICVS at any stage of development ( Figure 4K , L ) , indicating that the ICVS do not contain typical mesenchymal cells . Interestingly , collagen I and elastin , both ECM proteins normally seen surrounding SMC in the tunica media of blood vessels and also found in mature valve leaflets ( Hinton and Yutzey , 2011 ) , were transiently expressed only in the forming ICVS but not in the surrounding walls or main cushions at E11 . 5 ( Figure 4M – O and Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ) . These data suggest that at E11 . 5 and E12 . 5 , the ICVS cells express different markers to the cells that make up the right and left leaflets and the adjacent myocardial wall . In contrast , lam - inin , an ECM protein highly expressed in the basement membrane of epithelia , was highly expressed in the ICVS at E10 . 5 but was down - regulated by E11 . 5 - E12 . 5 ( Figure 4P – R ) . Together , these data suggest that epithelial SHF progenitors in the ICVS differentiate to valve interstitial cells , but not via an undifferentiated mesenchymal intermediate . To rule out EMT as a mechanism , we evaluated Eley et al . eLife 2018 ; 7 : e34110 . DOI : https : / / doi . org / 10 . 7554 / eLife . 34110 8 of 27 Research article Developmental Biology Figure 4 .

Notably , there was no expression of transcripts for either Slug or Snail within the ICVS at E10 . 5 or E11 . 5 , although both were abundantly expressed in both the endothelium and newly formed mesenchyme of the main outflow cushions ( Figure 4S – V and Figure 4—figure supple - ment 1 ) . Thus , although the cells of the ICVS change from an epithelial to valve interstitial cell phe - notype , this does not occur via classical EMT . Jagged - Notch signalling is active and required for ICVS development Notch1 signalling plays an essential role in formation of the atrioventricular and main outflow cush - ions in the developing heart . It is involved , together with its ligand Dll4 , in EndMT ( Luna - Zurita et al . , 2010 ) , but also acts later during valve remodelling with an alternative ligand , Jag1 ( MacGrogan et al . , 2016 ) . Moreover , NOTCH1 mutations have been implicated in BAV ( Garg et al . , 2005 ) . To identify the molecular mechanism underpinning formation of the ICVS we first asked whether there is Notch1 signalling activity in the ICVS . Immunolabelling confirmed that the active Notch1 receptor ( Notch1 intracellular domain or N1ICD ) was present in the non - myocardial walls of the aortic sac , the distal outflow and the endocardium . It was specifically expressed in cells within the ICVS at E10 . 5 although by E11 . 5 only a few cells in the cardiac jelly overlying the core of the ICVS continued to express nuclear N1ICD ( Figure 5A , E , I ) , indicating a temporal window of Notch1 signalling activity . Immuno staining for Notch2 ( using an antibody that recognised the uncleaved form of the protein ) was also expressed in the membranes of cells within the ICVS but not in the main cushions ( Figure 5B , F , J ) . Dll4 was found in the endocardium with N1ICD , but not in the ICVS at either E10 . 5 or E11 . 5 ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1 ) . We also evaluated the expression of both Jag1 and Jag2 ligands in this region of the heart . Jag1 protein was specifically detected within the distal outflow wall and in the core of the ICVS at both E10 . 5 and E11 . 5 ( Figure 5C , G , K ) . In contrast , Jag2 was detected only in the inner adluminal region of the ICVS , close to the Notch1ICD - express - ing endothelial cells ( Figure 5D , H , L ) . On closer examination Notch 2 , Jag1 and Jag2 were found at the membrane of ICVS cells that expressed Isl1 at E10 . 5 and E11 . 5 whereas N1ICD was mostly expressed in the nucleus of Isl1 - negative cells ( Figure 5Q - AB and Figure 5—figure supplement 2 ) . By E12 . 5 , neither N1ICD or Notch2 , nor Jag1 or Jag2 , were expressed in the interstitial cells within the ICVS ( Figure 5M – P ) , although both N1ICD and Notch2 were expressed in the valve endothe - lium . Thus , it appeared that Notch signalling was temporally and spatially associated with differentia - tion of ICVS SHF - derived cells into valve interstitial cells . To test the requirement for Jag - Notch signalling in formation of the ICVS , we deleted Jag1 gene expression using Tnnt2 - Cre and examined the arterial valve appearances at E16 . 5 . No Jag1 f / f ; Tnnt2 - Cre ( 0 / 11 ) or Jag2 f / f ; Tnnt2 - Cre ( 0 / 2 ) embryos demonstrated BAV , nor were abnormalities observed in Tnnt2 - Cre - negative embryos ( Figure 6A ) . We therefore wondered if Jag1 and Jag2 might be compensating for each other in the formation of the ICVS , as has been demonstrated in ventricular maturation ( D’Amato et al . , 2016 ) . Jag1 f / f , Jag2 f / f and Tnnt2 - Cre animals were inter - crossed and the arterial valve phenotype examined in the resulting offspring . In this complex genetic breeding experiment , BAV was observed in 1 / 3 Jag1 f / + ; Jag2 f / f ; Tnnt2 - Cre mutants examined ( Figure 6B ) , whilst in the absence of both ligands 4 / 11 Jag1 f / f ; Jag2 f / f cTnnt2 - Cre embryos demonstrated BAV ( Figure 6C ) . Notably , the posterior ( non - coronary ) leaflet appeared to be missing in each case and there was no obvious presence of a raphe that would indicate leaflet fusion . One additional Jag1 f / f ; Jag2 f / f ; Tnnt2 - Cre embryo had only a rudimentary posterior leaflet ( Figure 6D ) and a further 4 / 11 Jag1 f / f ; Jag2 f / f ; Tnnt2 - Cre embryos had thickened or dysplastic arterial valve leaflets affecting either / both the aorta and pulmonary valve ( Figure 6C ) . In these latter cases , abnormalities in all three leaf - lets of the valves were apparent . Thus , 9 / 11 Jag1 f / f ; Jag2 f / f ; Tnnt2 - Cre embryos examined had major abnormalities in the development of the arterial valve leaflets , that affected the anterior / posterior leaflets that develop from the Tnnt2 - Cre + ICVS . Most ( 7 / 9 ) of these valve defects in the Jag1 f / f ; Jag2 f / f ; Tnnt2 - Cre embryos occurred in the context of other cardiac anomalies , most commonly ven - tricular septal defect or double outlet right ventricle . Similar abnormalities to those we observed in Jag2 f / f ; Tnnt2 - Cre mutants have previously been described for the Notch regulator Mib1 f / f ; Tnnt2 - Cre embryos ( Captur et al . , 2016 ) . We therefore confirmed these findings , showing absence ( 1 / 9 ) or dysplasia ( 8 / 9 ) of the non - adjacent ( non - coro - nary ) leaflet in the mutant embryos at E16 . 5 ( Figure 6E , F ) .

This supports the idea that Notch signalling plays a critical role in the formation of the ICVS . SHF deficiency leads to ICVS defects and BAV These data indicate that the SHF addition to the outflow tract wall is required for formation of the ICVS , which then give rise to the posterior leaflet of the aortic valve and the anterior leaflet of the pulmonary valve . We wondered if reduction of SHF addition to the ICVS would be sufficient to cre - ate hypoplastic ICVS and produce BAV . We have previously disrupted SHF addition to the outflow tract by deleting Vangl2 gene expression from the SHF using Isl1 - Cre . This resulted in disruption of epithelial polarity and premature differentiation of SHF cells within the distal outflow tract of Vangl2 ; Isl1 - Cre mutants , leading to double outlet right ventricle and ventricular septal defect ( Ramsbottom et al . , 2014 ) . At that time , we did not examine the development of the aortic and pul - monary valves . As the naturally occurring Vangl2 mutant loop - tail , which is fully re - capitulated by SHF deletion of Vangl2 ( Ramsbottom et al . , 2014 ) , demonstrates aortic , but not pulmonary , hypo - plasia ( Henderson et al . , 2001 ) , we speculated that loss of Vangl2 in the SHF progenitors would dis - rupt formation of the ICVS , particularly affecting the aortic side of the outflow . Analysis of seven Vangl2 f / f ; Isl1 - Cre embryos at E15 . 5 revealed that 57 % ( 4 / 7 ) of them had dysplastic leaflets and BAV without raphe , with absence of the leaflet normally positioned posteriorly ( Figure 7A – D and Fig - ure 7—figure supplement 1 ) . Dysplasia of the pulmonary valve was also observed in these hearts . Analysis at E10 . 5 and 11 . 5 showed that although both the aortic and the pulmonary ICVS were pres - ent in Vangl2 f / f ; Isl1 - Cre heart , they were misplaced . In 2 / 6 cases , they were also smaller than expected ( Figure 7E – H ) . Despite this they demonstrated apparently normal expression of a panel of markers at E11 . 5 , including Isl1 , b - catenin and E - cadherin ( Figure 7E – H and Figure 7—figure sup - plements 1 and 2 ) . However , Notch1ICD and Jag1 were missing or reduced in 2 / 3 E11 . 5 Vangl2 f / f ; Isl1 - Cre hearts examined ( Figure 7I – L ) , suggesting that Notch signalling was disrupted in these mutants . Moreover , there was abnormal distribution of cTnI - expressing myocardial cells surrounding the ICVS at E11 . 5 and E12 . 5 ( arrows in Figure 7—figure supplements 1 and 2 ) . Close examination suggested that these were within the ICVS / valve primordium and so likely reflect abnormal differen - tiation or ingrowth of cardiomyocytes rather than detachment of layers of myocardium . Together , the hypoplastic ICVS and misexpression of cTnI suggest that rather than forming valve interstitial cells , the ICVS may be mis - specified or prematurely differentiate to myocardium , thus preventing the formation of a mature leaflet in this position . DiGeorge syndrome is a chromosomal micro - deletion syndrome with cardiovascular defects , due to deficiency of the TBX1 gene . Tbx1 null mice replicate the cardiovascular features seen in patients with DiGeorge syndrome . As the SHF - derived pulmonary myocardium of the outflow tract is defi - cient in these mice , and absence of the anterior leaflet of the pulmonary valve has also been reported ( The´veniau - Ruissy et al . , 2008 ) , we wondered whether these mutants might exhibit hypo - plasia of the pulmonary ICVS . Analysis of Tbx1 null mice at E15 . 5 and E12 . 5 confirmed that the valve leaflets were markedly abnormal within the unseptated Tbx1 - / - outflow tract ( Figure 8A , D ) . Utilising a SMA and cTnI antibodies , a single ICVS could be seen in the Tbx1 - / - outflow tract at E12 . 5 . Looking earlier , at E11 . 5 , whereas a well - developed aortic ICVS could be seen in Tbx1 - / - , it was impossible to distinguish a discrete pulmonary ICVS , with cTnI and a SMA - expressing cells within the expected region ( Figure 8E – H ) . Thus , as in Vangl2 ; Isl1 - Cre mutants , the disrupted development of the ICVS may underpin , at least in part , the arterial valve defects seen in Tbx1 mutant mice . Discussion We have shown that the formation of the arterial valves , whilst encompassing some processes that are similar to the atrioventricular valves , is uniquely different , by virtue of the large influx of NCC and the dominant role played by the SHF . The central four valve leaflets , formed as the outflow tract septates , are filled by NCC and SHF cells secondarily derived through endocardium and transformed into valve interstitial cell precursors by EndMT . In contrast , the intercalated valve structures are not cardiac jelly - derived endocardial cushions , but instead differentiate directly from ( Mef2c - AHF - Cre + ; Tnnt2 - Cre + ) SHF - derived outflow wall ; Figure 9 ) . These cells retain signatures of previous cardiac troponin promoter activation , although they are not , and never have been , of myocardial phenotype . Eley et al . eLife 2018 ; 7 : e34110 .

Ultimately , however , they appear indistinguishable from the valve leaflets derived from the main outflow cushions . Specifically , we find no evidence of trans - differentiation of either cardiomyocytes or SMC to the interstitial cells within the ICVS , the concomitant reduction of Isl1 and increase in Sox9 protein levels within the ICVS instead indicating a mechanism of direct differentiation of SHF progenitors into valve cells . These studies show that three lineages make significant contributions to the arterial valve leaflets ; NCC , EDC and a novel population of SHF progenitors cells that transiently activate the Tnnt2 - Cre driver , but differentiate directly into valve interstitial cells without passing through the endocardium nor myocardial lineages . This novel population makes the major contribution to the anterior and pos - terior leaflets derived from the ICVS , and also significant contributions to the left and right leaflets , derived from the main cushions ( Figure 9 ) . Although a technical limitation of these Cre - based stud - ies is the inability to track both SHF and NCC lineages concomitantly , the absolute numbers of cells counted , and the proportions of each , suggest that any other lineages can only comprise a minor component ( Figure 9 ) . Previous studies have suggested that the possibility of trans - differentiation of cardiomyocytes in the distal outflow ( Ya et al . , 1998 ) . These studies were performed before knowl - edge of the SHF and the now accepted concept that cells are added to the distal poles of the out - flow tract . Our data strongly argue against trans - differentiation as a mechanism for formation of the ICVS as although the Tnnt2 - Cre + cells activated the cTnT promoter , we never saw co - expression of cardiomyocyte markers in the forming ICVS and could identify a few Tnnt2 - Cre + / cTnI - cells even at E9 . 5 , before the ICVS form . As well as making the major contribution to the forming ICVS , these Tnnt2 - Cre + lineage cells contribute cells to the postnatal valve leaflets although detailed phenotyp - ing and analysis of the fate of these cells is beyond the scope of this manuscript . Cre lineage tracing identifies cells and their descendants that currently , or have ever , expressed the promoter / enhancer element used to drive Cre protein - based recombination of a reporter gene . It is evident from this study that to interpret such data it is essential to track protein expression of the Cre - driven promoter product . In the original description of the Tnnt2 - Cre driver ( Jiao et al . , 2003 ) , it was stated that the rat cTnT promoter construct drove cardiomyocyte - specific expression up to E10 . 5 , but its expression pattern later in gestation was not described . It has also been reported that cTnT is expressed in some SMC and can modulate their contraction ( Wang et al . , 2001 ; Kajioka et al . , 2012 ) . From data presented here it is clear that Tnnt2 - Cre labels arterial SMC , as well as the ICVS . However , as we could not find evidence of cTnT protein expression in these lat - ter cell types , even when we looked at the earliest stages , it is likely that transient activation of the promoter occurred in undifferentiated , potentially multipotent , SHF progenitors within the distal outflow . Analysis of this phenomenon in relation to the SMC is the subject of further study in our lab - oratory . With respect to the ICVS , rather than becoming cardiomyocytes , Tnnt2 - Cre labeled cells activated Sox9 expression and differentiated to valve interstitial cells , although this occurred at E11 . 5 , approximately a day later than the more proximal cells within the wall differentiated to cardiomyocytes . Our data are generally in agreement with and build on the data of Sizarov et al ( Sizarov et al . , 2012 ) . However , these authors did not observe Sox9 staining within the cells of the ICVS of approxi - mately stage - matched human embryos , although they did see Isl1 labelling . They also suggested that the ‘columns’ they described were mesenchymal , although our data show that , at least in the early stages , they are epithelial . Moreover , we did not see expression of classical mesenchymal markers such as N - cadherin , a SMA and Fsp1 , although the ICVS did express elastin , which is found in mature valve leaflets . The differences between these studies are unclear , but it may be that they reflect the transient expression of some of these markers and / or slight differences in staging and maturation of the ICVS between mouse and human . The delay in differentiation of cells within the ICVS may at least partially explain the activation of the Tnnt2 promoter in these cells , as they may be poised , but stalled , for differentiation . The presence of Tnnt2 - Cre + lineage cells in the ICVS of the mouse may be a valuable tool to investigate other genes involved in ICVS development , as it allows deletion in the directly - differentiating SHF population in the ICVS , without affecting NCC or EDC . For example , Mib1 is a ubiquitin ligase required in signalling cells for Jag activity . Here , and in a pre - vious publication ( Captur et al . , 2016 ) , arterial valve defects were observed in Mib1 ; Tnnt2 - Cre mutants , although initially the reason for this was unclear . Our data suggest that these defects likely arise because Tnnt2 - Cre is activated in the valve primordia , deleting Mib1 and thus inactivating Eley et al . eLife 2018 ; 7 : e34110 .

This prevents the ICVS , and to a lesser extent the main cushions , from forming properly thus resulting in abnormal leaflets in the mutant embryos . EndMT is a crucial process for typical endocardial cushions , but not for ICVS , where the major process is development from SHF cells that directly differentiate into valve interstitial cells in situ . In contrast , there is minor deposition of ECM and Sox9 + cells in the sub - endothelial compartment of the forming ICVS , indicative of a small contribution by EndMT to the ICVS in this region . Notch1 together with Dll4 , plays a critical early role during EndMT and Notch signalling is known to be vital for normal development of the main endocardial cushions . Deletion of both Notch1 and Dll4 ( Limbourg et al . , 2005 ) , result in the early death of the embryos , by E10 . 5 , precluding examination for ICVS formation and thus making it difficult to exclude EndMT from a crucial role in formation of the ICVS . However , evidence from the knockout of Brg1 in endothelium using Nfatc1 - Cre ( Akerberg et al . , 2015 ) provides evidence that ICVS are not dependent on EndMT as both anterior and posterior arterial valves leaflets appeared well formed in this mutant . Our mouse data , in keeping with those of Sizarov who studied human embryos ( Sizarov et al . , 2012 ) , suggest that the ICVS form as expansions of compacted cells within the wall of the distal OFT from cells in continuity with the epithelial SHF . These condensations form at the proximal extent of the ‘fishmouth’ of non - myocardial distal outflow wall ( Anderson et al . , 2012 ) as seen in Figure 1O , likely reflecting the asymmetrical addition of SHF cells and the rotation of the outflow wall ( Scherptong et al . , 2012 ; Bajolle et al . , 2006 ) . These cell condensations then separate from the surrounding wall , forming discrete structures that then undergo differentiation to typical valve cells . Thus , these ICVS cells appear to share an origin and be juxtaposed with the myocardial compo - nent of the outflow wall . Indeed , both the myocardial and the ICVS cells are Tnnt2 - Cre + suggesting a close relationship between the two populations . It is of note that Jag1 was abundant in the ICVS , which do not utilise EndMT / EMT , and is also abundantly expressed in the outflow tract myocardium . Although Jag1 is also essential for valve development , its role in EndMT is controversial , with some authors suggesting it is important ( Wang et al . , 2013 ) , but others suggesting it is not required for EndMT but plays a later role in the remodelling phases of the main cushion - derived heart valves ( MacGrogan et al . , 2016 ) . From our data , and those of others ( High et al . , 2007 ) , it seems likely that it is Notch1 and / or Notch2 that is the main Notch receptor in the ICVS . Notch1ICD was found in the distal outflow wall and the ICVS , but only transiently , and it was largely down - regulated by E11 . 5 . Notch2 was expressed throughout the ICVS and until E11 . 5 , although as we could not obtain an antibody for the active form of this protein , we cannot be sure that signalling was underway throughout this period . This transient expression within the ICVS is in contrast to the endocardium overlying the main cushions , where both Notch1 and Notch2 were maintained until E12 . 5 and beyond ( Del Monte et al . , 2007 ) . Notch signalling has been shown to be important for the differen - tiation of cardiac progenitor cells , with its down - regulation crucial for differentiation to cardiomyo - cytes ( Nemir et al . , 2006 ; Kwon et al . , 2009 ) and for activation of Sox9 in cartilage precursors ( Mead and Yutzey , 2009 ) . Thus , the presence and then subsequent removal of Notch1 signalling may be essential in the ICVS for their differentiation to valve interstitial cells . In support of the idea that Notch - Jag signalling is playing an important role in the development of the ICVS , the deletion of Jag1 / Jag2 using Tnnt2 - Cre resulted in abnormal development of the arterial valve leaflets in 9 / 11 double mutants examined , including BAV without raphe . Specifically , in 5 / 11 cases the phenotype was absence or hypoplasia of the non - coronary leaflet that is derived from the ICVS . Although the Jag1 / 2 ; Tnnt2 - Cre mice have a range of defects affecting the ventricular myocardium ( D’Amato et al . , 2016 ) , and so valve defects secondary to the ventricular defects cannot strictly be ruled out , it seems more likely that the reduction / loss of the non - coronary leaflet results from the deletion of Jag expression specifically in the ICVS . The redundancy of Jag1 and Jag2 is intriguing and is reminiscent of ventricular wall development ( D’Amato et al . , 2016 ) . Although Jag1 was expressed in the core of the ICVS , Jag2 was restricted to the adluminal cells , close to N1ICD - expressing cells , suggesting that there may be some ligand - specific functional specialization . Further studies will be necessary to delineate these likely complex interactions . The Vangl2 ; Isl1 - Cre and Tbx1 mutant mouse lines , both of which have abnormalities associated with limited addition of SHF cells to the outflow , have abnormal valve leaflets that result from failure to form or mature the ICVS ; a mechanism that has not previously been described . In the Vangl2 mutant , premature differentiation of SHF to cardiomyocytes , as occurs earlier in the aortic sac ( Ramsbottom et al . , 2014 ) , may reduce the availability of SHF - derived cells to form Sox9 + valve Eley et al . eLife 2018 ; 7 : e34110 . DOI : https : / / doi . org / 10 . 7554 / eLife . 34110 18 of 27 Research article Developmental Biology interstitial cells and may underlie the reduction in the size of the ICVS and ultimately lead to BAV . The reduction in Notch1ICD and Jag1 in 2 of 3 Vangl2 f / f ; Isl1 - Cre embryos suggests that Notch sig - nalling may be playing a role in this process and be regulated by Vangl2 , either directly or indirectly . Notably , the defects were more common in the aortic valve ( as they are in the Notch signalling path - way mutants ) and although the reasons for this are uncertain , aortic ( but never pulmonary ) hypopla - sia is common in the naturally occurring Vangl2 mutant , loop - tail ( Henderson et al . , 2001 ) . This suggests that it is the SHF that contributes to the aorta that is preferentially affected in this mutant . Premature loss of progenitor phenotype and differentiation of cardiomyocytes leading to a marked reduction of SHF - derived subpulmonary myocardium has been reported in the Tbx1 mutant mouse ( Vitelli et al . , 2010 ) . In addition , absence of the anterior leaflet of the pulmonary valve ( derived from the pulmonary ICVS ) has also been reported ( The´veniau - Ruissy et al . , 2008 ) . Our analyses extend these data to show that a discrete pulmonary ICVS is never formed in the Tbx1 - / - and high - lights similarities in the ICVS phenotype between these and the Vangl2 ; Isl1 - Cre mutants . Moreover , the role of both Vangl2 and Tbx1 in regulating the epithelial properties of the SHF ( Ramsbottom et al . , 2014 ; Francou et al . , 2014 ) , which form the myocardium and also appear to form the ICVS , suggests that the epithelial phenotype of these cells , at least at early stages of their development , may be crucial . Indeed , it raises the possibility that there is an intrinsic relationship between the loss of epithelial properties of the wall and differentiation of the cells within it to cardio - myocytes . These differences between the affected valve observed between Vangl2 and Tbx1 mutants likely reflect inherent differences in the patterning of the outflow tract , further reflecting subdomains within the SHF ( Vitelli et al . , 2010 ; Scherptong et al . , 2012 ) . BAV has been described in a number of mouse mutants . Notably , in several cases ( including following knockout of Alk2 , a BMP receptor ( Thomas et al . , 2012 ) , and Slit / Robo ( Mommersteeg et al . , 2015 ) signalling ) the anterior / non - coronary leaflets specifically failed to form properly . This , therefore may be a common mechanism underlying BAV ( without raphe ) formation , at least in mice , and may occur when there is disruption of the SHF as we see in the Vangl2 ; Isl1 - Cre and Tbx1 mutants . Raphe are infrequently described in mouse mutants with BAV , although this may be because most mouse mutants are described during fetal life when the leaflets remain unsculpted and thus before a true raphe would be apparent . Although it is not possible to demonstrate the mechanisms of arterial valve develop - ment using human embryos it is important to note that at comparable stages of development the appearances of human and mouse valve primordia are very similar and importantly , the expression pattern of Isl1 , marking SHF progenitors , is identical . Together our data suggest that loss of SHF progenitors , either because of a failure of their formation or their premature differentiation , may be a common cause of BAV and can explain the common association between this and other intra - car - diac heart malformations . As such , BAV formed in this way may link to the subtype of BAV patterns without raphe , as occurs in 5 – 10 % of BAV cases ( Sievers and Schmidtke , 2007 ; Buchner et al . , 2010 ) . It will be important to analyse genomic data from patients with this BAV phenotype , search - ing in particular in SHF and Jag - Notch pathways . Our murine and human data show differences between the structure of the aortic and pulmonary ICVS as they develop , that could have relevance to the common incidence of BAV compared to bicuspid pulmonary valve . The aortic ICVS develops more proximally and is not surrounded by a myocardial cuff as it develops , compared with the pulmonary ICVS , which is more distal and is completely surrounded by cardiomyocytes . These differences have also been reported recently in a histological examination of human embryos ( Milos et al . , 2017 ) . Moreover , the pulmonary ICVS has a lesser contribution from NCC than does the aortic , and based on the differences we see between Vangl2 and Tbx1 mutants , may have different genetic regulation . The ICVS also express tropoelastin during their formation , whereas the main cushions do not , suggesting that these differences in cell lineage between the forming leaflets are reflected by expression of specific proteins . These differen - ces are likely to have morphogenetic impacts on the developing aortic and pulmonary ICVS , which might reflect in their differential predisposition to pathology . Although bicuspid pulmonary valve is rare as an isolated finding in humans , it is common in association with tetralogy of Fallot ( Chacko et al . , 2017 ) . Thus , defects in the SHF that result in failure to develop one or other ICVS might be relevant to a high proportion of human valve abnormalities . Eley et al . eLife 2018 ; 7 : e34110 .

As both marker genes are targeted into the Rosa26 locus and there is no sugges - tion of differences in recombination in response to Cre between these two lines ( Liu et al . , 2013 ) , the two lines were used interchangeably . Vangl2 flox ; Isl1 - Cre ( Ramsbottom et al . , 2014 ) , Tbx1 ( Jerome and Papaioannou , 2001 ) , Jag1 flox ; Jag2 flox ; Tnnt2 - Cre ( D’Amato et al . , 2016 ) , and Mib1 flox ; Tnnt2 - Cre ( Garg et al . , 2005 ) were used and genotyped as described previously . Timed matings were carried out overnight and the presence of a copulation plug was designated embryonic day ( E ) 0 . 5 . All mice were maintained on a C57Bl / 6 background , backcrossed for three generations , then maintained by brother - sister matings . Littermate controls were used where appropriate . Each experi - ment was carried out in , at minimal , triplicate . Cre expression was induced in the Wt1 - ERT - Cre line by Tamoxifen injection . Pregnant females were injected intraperitoneally with 100 m l of tamoxifen ( 10 mg / ml ) dissolved in ethanol and peanut oil on three consecutive days ( E9 . 5 , E10 . 5 , E11 . 5 ) . Embryos were then collected at E12 . 5 . Mice were maintained according to the Animals ( Scientific Procedures ) Act 1986 , United Kingdom , under project license PPL 30 / 3876 . All experiments were approved by the Newcastle University Ethical Review Panel . Embryos were harvested at different developmental stages , rinsed in ice - cold phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) and fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde at 4 ˚ C , the duration of which depended on the age of the embryo ( 4 hr for E9 . 5 – 10 . 5 , overnight for E11 . 5 and 48 hr for E12 . 5 to E15 . 5 ) , before paraffin embedding . Embryos were embedded in either a transverse , frontal or sagittal orientation . For each analysis carried out using embryos , a minimum of 3 embryos for each developmental stage and sec - tion orientation were used ( biological replicates ) . Stage matching was carried out based on somite counting and other external features such as limb maturity . The analyses were carried out as sepa - rate experiments and a minimum of 5 – 10 sections ( technical replicates ) were analysed for consis - tency . For basic histological analysis , paraffin - embedded embryos were sectioned and stained with haemotoxylin and eosin following standard protocols . Human embryos The human embryonic and fetal material was provided by the Joint MRC / Wellcome Trust ( grant # 099175 / Z / 12 / Z ) Human Developmental Biology Resource ( www . hdbr . org [ Gerrelli et al . , 2015 ] ) . For basic histological analysis , paraffin - embedded embryos were sectioned and stained with haemotoxy - lin and eosin following standard protocols . Three - dimensional reconstruction Serial sections were photographed from control and mutant embryos at E10 . 5 and E11 . 5 . The sec - tions were aligned and three dimensional reconstructions were carried out using Amira 4 . 0 accord - ing to standard protocols ( Soufan et al . , 2003 ) . Immunohistochemistry / Immunofluorescence Methodology has been published previously ( Phillips et al . , 2007 ) . Sections were cut from paraffin embedded embryos at 8 m m using a rotary microtome ( Leica ) . Slides were de - waxed with Histoclear ( National Diagnostics ) and rehydrated through a series of ethanol washes . For immunohistochemistry for lineage tracing purposes , endogenous peroxidases were inhibited by treating slides with 3 % Eley et al . eLife 2018 ; 7 : e34110 .

Following washes in PBS , antigen retrieval was performed by boiling slides in citrate buffer ( 0 . 01 mol / L ) pH 6 . 3 for 5 min . Samples were blocked in 10 % FCS and then incubated over - night at 4 ˚ C with the primary antibody GFP ( Abcam ) diluted in 2 % FCS . Samples were then incu - bated with an anti - chicken biotinylated secondary antibody ( Dako ) for 1 hr , then with AB complex ( Vector labs ) for 30 min then stained with DAB and mounted using Histomount . This amplification step ensured maximal detection of antigen . Bright field images were captured using the Zeiss Axio - plan . For immunofluorescence , following washes in PBS , antigen retrieval was performed by boiling slides in citrate buffer ( 0 . 01 mol / L ) pH 6 . 3 for 5 min . Sections were blocked in 10 % FCS and then incubated overnight at 4 ˚ C with the primary antibodies ( see key resources table ) diluted in 2 % FCS . After washing , sections were incubated at room temperature for one hour , with secondary antibod - ies conjugated to either Alexa 488 or Alexa 594 ( Life Technologies ) . Fluorescent slides were then mounted with Vectashield Mounting medium with DAPI ( Vector Labs ) . Each experiment was carried out in triplicate using separate embryos ( > 3 ) and imaging multiple sections of the structure of inter - est ( > 5 ) . Immunofluorescence images were collected with using a Zeiss Axioimager Z1 fluorescence microscope equipped with Zeiss Apotome 2 ( Zeiss , Germany ) . Acquired images were processed with AxioVision Rel 4 . 9 software . cDNA probes and in situ hybridisation Methodology was adapted from ( Smart et al . , 2002 ) . Digoxigenin ( DIG ) - labeled RNA antisense probes corresponding to the protein coding regions of Slug ( EF450456 . 1 ; Forward primer : TTTCAACGCCTCCAAGAAGC ; Reverse primer : TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGGCAGCCAGACTCC TCATGTT ) and Snail ( NM _ 001032543 ; [ Sefton et al . , 1998 ] ) were synthesized by T7 RNA polymer - ase ( MAXIScript , Ambion ) and in vitro transcription ( pGEM _ T easy , Promega ) , respectively . The slide in situ hybridization was performed using 10 um paraffin - embedded sections of E10 . 5 and E11 . 5 mouse embryos . Slides were de - waxed with Histoclear ( National Diagnostics ) and rehydrated with ethanol series washes . Slides were then fixed in 4 % DEPC - PFA for 20 min at room temperature prior to the treatment with proteinase K ( 10 m g / mL ) for 10 min at 37 ˚ C . Post - fixation by 4 % DEPC - PFA was performed at room temperature for 5 min . Slides were then processed to the acetylation reac - tion for 10 min in solution containing 100 mM Triethanolamine , 40 mM Hydrochloric acid and 250 mM Acetic Anhydride . After that , pre - hybridization was performed for 2 hr at 68 ˚ C using hybridiza - tion buffer ( 50 % formamide , 5x SSC ( pH6 ) , 200 m g / mL T - RNA , 100 m g / mL Heparin , 0 . 1 % tween - 20 ) ; hybridization was carried out for 16 hr using the same buffer with RNA probes . Following a series of washes , slides were blocked in 2 % MABT ( maleic acid buffer containing Tween 20 ) blocking solution ( Roche ) for 2 hr and incubated with anti - digoxigenin - AP , fab fragments ( Roche ) overnight at 4 ˚ C . Slides were then developed in NBT / BCIP solution for 18 – 36 hr at room temperature and the reaction terminated through incubation in 100 % methanol for 5 min . Counterstaining with 1 % eosin for 5 min was performed , followed by dehydration with washes in a serial ethanol dilutions ( 30 – 60 s per wash ) , incubation in Histoclear twice for 10 min , and finally mounting slides with Histomount ( Agar scien - tific ) . Each experiment was carried out in triplicate using separate embryos ( > 3 ) and imaging multiple sections of the structure of interest ( > 5 ) . Cell counts and statistical analysis For quantification of Mef2c - AHF - Cre in the E12 . 5 arterial valve leaflet primordia , labelled and unla - belled cells were counted by a single observer ( with checks for accuracy from an independent observer ) from each of the six discrete primordia . In each case , three representative sections from three different embryos were counted . All sections were 8 m m ( as were comparable data sets in Phillips et al . , 2013 ) . Chi squared analysis was used to show that the proportion of Mef2c - AHF - Cre lineage cells between the different arterial valve primordia were significantly different . Pairwise chi - squared comparison between the primordia , with Bonferroni correction for multiple testing , con - firmed that the aortic non - coronary primordium was statistically different from all other primordia .
