Effects of RabGTPases on SV40 Infection and Trafficking ( A ) HeLa cells expressing indicated Rab constructs or RIN1 were infected with SV40 at a multiplicity of infection ( MOI ) of 5 . After infection ( 16 hr ) , cells were fixed and immunostained for large T antigen ( Tag ) . The fraction of Tag - expressing cells of at least 120 transfected cells from three different experiments was determined and presented as percentage of nontransfected control cells . Dynamin2K44A ( Dyn2K44A ) was used as a positive control . Of the Rab constructs , only expression of Rab5aQ79L interfered with SV40 infection .

The 520 nm emission was measured by excitation at two different wavelengths ( 440 nm and 488 nm ) and the ratio between the two images calculated and pseudocolored . A calibration curve to calculate the pH was obtained from ionophore - treated cells in media of different pH ( Pelkmans et al . , 2001 ) .

SmallCav1 - GFP - labeled vesicles were seen to bind to larger Rab5a - SV40 was therefore unlikely to be transported to the endosomes by clathrin - mediated uptake despite the positive structures , to move along with them for up to 20 s as part of a complex , and then to detach ( Figure stimulation by constitutively active Rab5a ( Stenmark et al . , 1994 ) .

( B ) Cells transfected with Rab5Q79L were incubated with AF - ChTxB , Tfn , BODIPY - LacCer , or SV40 or cotransfected with GFP - M6PR , GFP - CLC , GFP - Rab5aQ79L , 2xFYVE - GFP , GPI - GFP , or Cav1 - GFP and used for FRAP analysis . After quantification of the intensity of the bleached area as exemplified in ( A ) and correction for overall bleaching during imaging , recovery curves were generated . The solid lines represent curves fitted by nonlinear regression to a 2D diffusion model . ( C ) SV40 infection in cells treated with a control siRNA ( against luciferase ) or Cav1 - siRNA . Cav1 depletion ( shown by Western blot ) moderately ( 40 % ) reduces SV40 infection . Expression of Rab5Q79L in these cells results in a near complete ( 95 % ) block in infection . Expression of Rab5S34N in these cells has no additional effects on SV40 infection . ( D ) A recovery curve and fit for AF - SV40 in an enlarged endosome of a cell treated with siRNA against Caveolin - 1 , showing that AF - SV40 is not restricted in its lateral mobility in the endosomal membrane .

R 2 indicates goodness of fit and should ideally be 1 . Bad fits are often caused by uncertainties about I max , which is seen when molecules are immobile . The fast half - time ( 24 s ) for AF - ChTxB at neutral pH reflects that of just a few mobile molecules not captured by caveolar domains , since the majority is captured and immobile ( 84 % ) . Note that whole endosome curves of 2XFYVE - GFP , GFP - Rab5Q79L , and CLC - GFP do not reflect membrane diffusion but exchange of membrane bound molecules with cytosolic molecules . Since Rab5Q79L is fairly immobile in this curve , the curve obtained from subdomain bleaching can be regarded as reflecting diffusion within the membrane only . For 2XFYVE - GFP , the fast half - time in the subdomain - bleached curve compared to the whole endosome - bleached curve indicates fast diffusion of this probe on the membrane . For CLC - GFP , the half - time and immobile fractions in both the subdomain - bleached curve and whole endosome - bleached curve are similar . Thus , subdomain recovery consists only of exchange , indicating that CLC - GFP is immobile on the membrane . Note that both Cav1 - GFP and AF - SV40 have very high half - times and show a very large immobile fraction , indicating that they are immobile . pH inside endosomes . After accumulation in enlarged Discussion endosomes in the presence of NH 4 Cl , the ChTxB did We have provided evidence that caveosomes and early indeed localizeto caveolardomains ( Figure5A ) . Further - endosomes communicate via a pathway regulated by more , ChTxB was now restricted in its mobility ( Figure Rab5 . On the endosomal membrane , caveolar vesicles 5B ) , while the recovery rates of GPI - GFP and BODIPY - form stabilized subdomains capable of entrapping LacCer upon bleaching were unaffected ( data not multivalent GM1 bound cargo . In endosomes , ChTxB is shown ) . Similar results were obtained in other cells ex - induced to diffuse out of these subdomains into the pressing only endogenous Caveolin - 1 ( data not shown ) . surrounding membrane by low pH , while SV40 remains Apparently , at neutral pH , ChTx was not released from trapped . As a result , the caveolar ligands are sorted caveolar vesicles after fusion with endosomes or was into different endocytic compartments . Based on these actively sequestered in stable caveolar domains in en - observations , we propose that caveolar domains serve dosomes . as specialized transport and sorting devices in intracel - In addition , we found that , in HeLa cells expressing lular membrane traffic ( Figure 6 ) . Their membrane is Cav1 - GFP , ChTxB accumulation in the Golgi complex composed of lipids enriched in raft fractions , stabilized was reduced in the presence of NH 4 Cl ( Figure 5C ) , while byastructuralCaveolin - 1scaffold , and , unlikelipidrafts , this was not perturbed in HeLa cells treated with siRNA they form distinct , structurally stable microdomains in against Caveolin - 1 . As expected , ChTxB was mobile on any membrane of the endocytic pathway through which the enlarged endosomal membrane in these cells , even they traffic . when treated with NH 4 Cl ( Figure 5B ) . These results sug - After internalization , caveolar vesicles can move in gest that caveolae - internalized ChTxB is only trans - the cytosol and fuse with caveosomes . When recruited ported to the Golgi complex when it is released from by specific small GTPases , they can also dock on target caveolar domains , which is mediated by low pH in endo - organelles such as early endosomes . After fusing with somes . Importantly , they provide an explanation for why these membranes , caveolae are not disassembled but ChTxB is immobile at early time points of internalization preserve their compartmentalization , retaining a unique ( Bacia et al . , 2002 ) , being present in organelles with lipid and protein composition .

Finally , our data clarify the necessity for with endocytic and exocytic organelles at several levels Rab5 - mediated transport of ChTxB to endosomes to byshuttling caveolarvesicles thatmaintain theirstability in time and space . Because the stabilizing scaffold of allow subsequent sorting to the Golgi complex . Cell776 Figure 5 . Low pH Triggers Release of Cholera Toxin from Caveolar Domains ( A ) HeLa cells stably expressing Cav1 - GFP were transfected with Rab5aQ79L and incubated with 100 pg AF - ChTxB either untreated or treated with NH 4 Cl to neutralize the pH inside endosomes . Confocal images show that , while , in untreated cells , ChTxB quickly spreads evenly across the endosomal membrane , in cells treated with NH 4 Cl , AF - ChTxB remains present in a patches on enlarged endosomes that colocalize with Cav1 - GFP . Scale bars , 2 (cid:2) m . ( B ) Recovery curves of ChTxB bleached in enlarged endosomes of cells treated with NH 4 Cl show that , at neutral pH , ChTxB is not released from caveolar domains . Depletion of Caveolin - 1 by siRNA allows diffusion at neutral pH . ( C ) In control cells , ChTxB has reached the Golgi complex after 1 hr , while , in cells treated with NH 4 Cl ( pH neutral ) , ChTxB remains trapped in endocytic structures . When cells were depleted of Caveolin - 1 , low pH was not necessary for ChTxB transport to the Golgi complex . Scale bars , 20 (cid:2) m . a caveolar domain is composed of oligomeric integral fusion . In so doing , its role is to define and ensure do - main identity and , unlike clathrin and COP coats , not membrane proteins that do not dissociate , it follows along as the vesicle undergoes intracellular transport , transiently but permanently . Importantly , this feature is distinct from lipid rafts , which move about the mem - cargo loading and unloading , and membrane fission and Sorting by Caveolar Coats 777 Figure 6 . Working Model on Sorting by Stable Caveolar Domains ( A ) Internalized caveolar vesicles are transiently targeted to early endosomes by Rab5 or interact with caveosomes . Targeting to other compartments ( indicated by a question mark ) likely involves transient interactions under the control of different GTPases . ( B ) Contrary to cargo sorting and vesicle formation by Clathrin , COPI , and COPII coats , caveolar vesicles contain permanently stabilized membrane - integratedcoatsthatdonotundergocyclicassociationanddissociation . Efficientsortingisachievedbyreleasingcargoinresponse to local cues received in a particular compartment , such as low pH in endosomes . Ligands not destined for that compartment stay trapped until arrived in a compartment that provides the right trigger for release . Cargo sequestration may also be controlled by local cues . Because caveolar vesicles retain their identity and only transiently interact , they are retrieved as such from the target membranes and can be utilized again . One advantage of such a system is that whole membrane domains including the lipids are prevented from dilution into target compart - ments unless triggered . This is different from vesicles formed by classical membrane coats that disassemble after vesicle formation , leading to a loss of membrane identity upon fusion with target membranes . brane continuously and exchange lipids and proteins nents such as EEA1 and PI ( 3 ) P and numerous nonraft components present in the plasma membrane . with surrounding nonraft membranes . Caveolar vesicles can regulate the release of certain Second , ChTxB dissociation from caveolar domains was induced by the low endosomal pH . Acidic pH is cargo , as exemplified by SV40 and ChTxB in endo - somes . Release and uptake of caveolar cargo depends known to induce a conformational change in the ChTxB pentamer that alters the spacing of the bound GM1 on how the cargo molecules interact with Caveolin - 1 , with other caveolar proteins , and with the lipids and , as molecules ( McCann et al . , 1997 ) . The change in the structure of the toxin - receptor complexes may be suffi - revealed in this study , on how cargo is influenced by compartment - specific “cues” such as changes in pH . cient to allowthem to diffuse fromthe caveolar domains .

From our by classical coats and transport vesicles .

This is consistent with reports using either immunolabelingofendogenousCaveolin - 1orbiochemical In cells expressing constitutively active Rab5 , most intracellular caveolar domains were associated with characterization of purified endosomes ( Dupree et al . , 1993 ; Gagescu et al . , 2000 ; Parton et al . , 1994 ; Peters early endosomes .

In electron microscopy images , caveolar domains are often part of a larger intracellular organelle enlarged endosomes .
