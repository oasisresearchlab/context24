ABSTRACT : Knowledge is recognized as an important weapon for sustaining com - petitive advantage and many companies are beginning to manage organizational knowl - edge . Researchers have investigated knowledge management factors such as enablers , processes , and performance . However , most current empirical research has explored the relationships between these factors in isolation . To fill this gap . this paper devel - ops a research model that interconnects knowledge management factors . The model inciudes seven enablers : collaboration , trust , learning , centralization , formalization . T - shaped skills , and information technology support . The emphasis is on knowledge creation processes such as socialization , externalization . combination , and iniemal - ization . To establish credibility between knowledge creation and performance , orga - nizational creativity is incorporated into the model . Surveys collected from 58 firms were analyzed to test the model . The results confirmed ihe impact of trust on knowl - edge creation . The information technology support had a positive impact on knowl - edge combination only . Organizational creativity was found to be critical for improving performance : neglecting ideas can undermine a business . The results may be used as a stepping stone for further empirical research and can help formulate rohust strate - gies that involve trade - offs between knowledge management enablers .

Companies that isolate knowl - edge management risk losing its benefits . It is no surprise that knowledge is overturn - ing the old rules about strategy and competition—the foundation of industrialized economics has shifted from natural resources to intellectual assets . In response , many managers and management thinkers have proclaimed an era of knowledge manage - ment . This has compelled researchers to investigate how knowledge is managed . Evi - dence is provided by a variety of studies on knowledge [ 19 , 79 , 82 ] , knowledge process [ 38 , 70 , 76 . 114J , and knowledge management architecture [ 9 , 21 . IO5 | . Companies attempting to deploy knowledge management may be confused by a variety of efforts under way that go under the name of knowledge management [ 61 ] . Many companies have tried , with mixed success , to leverage knowledge assets by centralizing knowledge management functions or by investing heavily in information technology ( IT ) [ 44 ] . It is understandable , when confronted with a new business phe - nomenon , to look to new management practices for guidance . Caught up in the gen - eral fever , many managers may assume that knowledge management can improve their companies . However , despite their best efforts , most studies have not investi - gated how companies can leverage knowledge for the improved performance . It is important to distinguish themselves through strategies . The key question is not whether to manage knowledge , but how to manage it . These strategies should be validated by the use of further empirical tests . To fill this gap , prior research has explored which factors are essential for managing knowledge effectively . One challenge is to decipher the relationships among these factors . Most studies have examined the relationships of knowledge management enablers , processes , or performance in isolation . For example , some research has fo - cused on the relationship between enablers and processes [ 6 , 43 , 114 , 124 ] ; the em - phasis of other studies is on the relationship between enablers and organizational performance [ 8 , 11 , 35 . 104 ] . Researchers and practitioners have not tried an integra - tive model . An integrative perspective of the knowledge variables ba . sed on relevant theories is a necessity . It is also noted that very few empirical studies adopt a process - oriented perspective of organizational knowledge [ 90 ] . Knowledge creation or trans - fer would benefit companies more than knowledge itself because knowledge is not primarily about facts but more about context - specific characteristics [ 115 ] . For ex - ample . Xerox systemizes knowledge creation and transfer processes through strategic communities [ 109 ] . Consequently , another challenge is to leverage a process - oriented perspective . The primary objective of this paper is to delineate an integrative view of knowledge management and provide strategic guidelines . For this purpose , this paper analyzes the previous empirical studies and attempts to fmd relationships among knowledge management factors such as enablers , processes , and organizational performance . An integrative research model is built from a process - oriented perspective and then tested empirically . KM ENABLERS . PROCESSES , AND ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE 181 Research Background and Literature Review Theoretical Background MANY RESEARCHERS HAVE EMPHASIZED three major factors for managing knowledge : enablers , processes , and organizational performance [ 9 . 21 , 851 . Knowledge manage - ment enablers { or influencing factors ) are organizational mechanisms for fostering knowl - edge consistently [ 57 ] ; they can stimulate knowledge creation , protect knowledge , and facilitate the sharing of knowledge in an organization [ 108 ] . Knowledge processes ( knowledge management activities ) can be thouglit of as a structured coordination for managing knowledge effectively [ 35 ] . Typically , knowledge proces . ses include activi - ties such as creation , sharing , storage , and usage [ 2 , 9 ] . Whereas knowledge processes represent the basic operations of knowledge [ 105 ] . enablers provide the infrastructure necessary for the organization to increase the efficiency of knowledge processes [ 96 ] . Organizational performance may be defined as the degree to which companies achieved its business objectives [ 28 ] . It may be measured in terms of organizational learning , profitability , or other financial benefits in knowledge management [ 18 , 104 [ . Without measurable success , passion from employees and managers will vanish [ 851 . There is a general recognition among academics that knowledge management is a cross - functional and multifaceted discipline . A variety of components make up knowl - edge management and the understanding of their interaction is important ; a holistic view is very useful [ 80 ] . To this end , an integrative research model is necessary ; that is , the relationships among knowledge enablers . processes , and organizational perfor - mance can he identified within the framework of systems thinking . Systems thinking theory considers probiems in their entirety 1951 . This theory is better able to describe complex and dynamic characteristics of knowledge management in a systematic fash - ion . Therefore , our integrative framework will be based on this systems thinking theory . Our primary research focus is on the relationships between knowledge enablers and organizational performance by elaborating on the significance of knowledge pro - cesses as the foundation of organizational advantage [ 79 ] . The relationship among these three components is nothing new ; it can be found in the input - process - output model by Hackerman and Morris [ 41 ] . The model assumes that the input factors affect output performances through certain kinds of interaction processes ; knowl - edge management enablers affect organizationai performance through knowledge processes . This relationship is also explained by the use of the knowledge - chain model proposed by Holsapple and Singh [ 51 ] . This model suggests that leadership estahlish enabling conditions for achieving organizational outcome through the knowledge management activities such as acquisition , generation , internalization , and extemali - zation . It means that knowledge enablers ( e . g . . leadership ) affect organizational out - come through knowledge processes . A direct relationship between knowledge processes and organizational performance is not explored yet . Because many factors influence the determination of the organiza - tional performance , attempts to trace causality to any single factor such as knowledge 182 LEE AND CHOI Enablers , Process - IntemicdiatcOutcome L OrgaoiPertor ^ tionalmance Figure I . An Integrative Research Framework for Studying Knowledge Management process may be risky . In order to understand the effect ofthe knowledge processes on organizational perfomiance , intermediate outcomes ( for example , knowledge satis - faction or organizational creativity ) may be introduced [ 18 ] . Intermediate outcotnes reflect different aspects of an organization ' s performance , both financial and nonfi - nancial . This incorporation may help confirm that enablers ultimately create business value . In sum , this paper proposes a researcb framework as sbown in Figure 1 . Previous Empirical Studies Previous empirical studies have investigated tbe relationsbips among knowledge management factors . They can be classified into four categories depending on how they identify tbe relation . ships : ( 1 ) relationships between knowledge enablers ; ( 2 ) re - lationships between knowledge enablers and process ; ( 3 ) relationsbips between knowl - edge process and organizational performance ; and ( 4 ) relationsbips among knowledge enablers . processes , and organizational performance . Tbis comparison may be high - lighted as sbown in Figure 2 . The studies under tbe first category focus on tbe relationsbips among knowledge enablers . Tbe emphasis is on the examination of tbe effect of knowledge enablers . To identify ( his effect , they have investigated various knowledge enablers such as knowl - edge management methods , structure , and culture . For example . Bennett and Gabriel [ 10 ] analyzed a number of knowledge management metbods in view of oi ^ aniza - tional structuns , culture , size , and environment . Tbe second category explores the relationships between knowledge enablers and knowledge processes . A central proposition is that knowledge enablers ( e . g . , industry characteristics or knowledge characteristics ) should influence knowledge processes ( e . g . . transfer ) . Zander and Kogut [ 124 ] proposed that the transfer of organizational capabilities be related to the characteristics of social knowiedge ; tbey analyzed the effects of the ease of codifying manufacturing capabilities on its transfer time . Appleyard [ 6 ] explored knowledge transfer patterns among various nations and in - dustries . Szulanski 1114 | investigated the relationship between four origins of sticki - ness ( characteristics of the knowledge transferred , tbe source , the recipient , and the context in wbicb the transfer takes place ) and knowledge transfer . Hansen [ 43 ] em - ployed the notion of complex knowledge to explain the role of weak ties in transfer - ring knowledge in a multiunit organization . The tbird category examines the reiationships between knowledge enablers and organizational performance . Tbe purpose of these studies is to sharpen the under - standing ofthe effects of knowledge enablers ( e . g . , knowledge management strategy ) KM ENABLERS . PROCESSES .

Note : ROA = Return on Assets ROS = Return on 5ales Figure 2 . Research Models for Studying Knowledge Management on organizational performance ( e . g . , return on assets [ ROA ] or return on sales ( ROS ) ) . Bierly and Chakrabarti [ 11 ] tried to identify how knowledge management strategies affect organizational performance . They analyzed knowledge strategies of 21 U . S . pharmaceutical companies that had been categorized into explorers , exploiters , lon - ers , and innovators . Simonin [ 104 ] tested the relationships among collaborative expe - rience , know - how , and achievement of organizational performance . He proposed that the experience of a firm has to be transformed into know - how before it could improve organizational performance . The emphasis of the fourth category is on relationships among knowledge enablers . knowledge processes , and organizational performance . The primary objective of these studies is to identify and assess knowledge enablers ( e . g . , task or infrastructure capa - bilities ) and processes { e . g . , creation or their capabilities ) for improving organiza - tional performance ( e . g . , knowledge satisfaction or organizational effectiveness ) . Becerra - Fernandez and Sabherwal [ 8 ] proposed a contingency framework including two attributes of the organizational subunit ' s tasks—process or content orientation , and focused or broad domain ^ —and linked them to Nonaka ' s knowledge creation process [ 82 ] . The relationship between knowledge creation process and knowledge satisfaction was also investigated . Gold et al . [ 35 ] analyzed two relationships : one 184 LEE AND CHOI between infrastructure capabilities and organizational effectiveness , and the other between process capabilities and organizational effectiveness . Table I compares these previous studies . Synthesis of Previous Studies Synthesis of previous studies yields some observations . First , an integrative model is still missing . Although some studies investigate the relationships among knowiedge enablers . processes , or organizational performance | 8 , 35 ) , they fail to explore the relationships between enablers and processes simultaneously . If managers understand these relationships in an integrative fashion , they ean stand a better chance of improv - ing their firm ' s performance . Second , the role of knowledge management processes is not consistent . Some stud - ies recognized both knowledge enablers and processes as antecedents of organiza - tional performance [ 8 , 351 . Other sludies recognized knowledge enablers as preconditions of knowiedge processes [ 6 , 43 , 114 , 124J . Therefore , the challenge is to clarify the role of knowledge management processes [ 108 ] . Third , measuring knowledge management performance is still difficult . Some stud - ies captured the contribution by the use of knowledge management outcome mea - sures such as knowledge satisfaction [ 8 ] , whereas others adopted conventional performance measures such as ROA [ 11 , 104 ] or organizational effectiveness [ 35 ] . It would appear that the former studies take the relationship between knowledge man - agement outcome and organizational performance for granted although the relation - ship has not been validated . The results of the latter studies should be examined carefully because the direct relationship between knowledge management processes and organizational performance has not been validated yet [ 18 ] . Fourth , the knowledge transfer process has been studied extensively [ 6 , 43 , 114 , 124 ] whereas the other processes such as creation or utilization have received rela - tively little attention . In particular , some studies have suggested that knowledge cre - ation is most critical for an organization ' s long - term success [ 30 ] . Moreover , knowledge transfer has been assessed by the use of object - perspective measures such as time to transfer [ 124 ] , number of times of knowiedge transfer [ 6 ] , or percentage of trans - ferred knowledge [ 43 | . Recently , some researchers have tried to measure knowledge processes themselves [ 8 . 35 ] . For example , Becerra - Fernandez and Sabherwal [ 8 ] measured the capacity for knowledge creation by Nonaka ' s knowledge creation model , not by the use of creation output such as the number of created ideas or patents . A Research Model OUR OBJECTIVE IS NEITHER TO PROPOSE a model that delineates all of the relation - ships underlying knowledge management nor to generate a longer list of possible knowledge enablers or processes that affect organizational performance .

Variables Enahlers A variety of knowledge management enablers have been addressed in the literature [ 57 , 70 . 97 | . Among these enablers . organizational culture , structure , people . , and IT are incorporated into our research model . Organizational culture is the most impor - tant factor for successful knowledge management [ 15 . 20 , 21 , 35 ] . Culture defines not only what knowledge is valued , but also what knowledge must be kept inside the organization for sustained innovative advantage [ 71 ] . Organizations should establish an appropriate culture that encourages people to create and share knowledge within an organization [ 49 , 70 ] . This study focuses on collaboration , trust , and learning on the basis ofthe concept of care [ 29 ] . Care is a key enabler for organizational relation - ships [ 68 ] . When organizational relationships are fostered through care , knowledge can be created and shared . The organizational structure within an organization may encourage or inhibit knowl - edge management [ 35 , 47 , 82 ] . For example , Ichijo et al . | 57 ] insisted that firms should maintain consistency between their structures to put their knowledge to use . Our study includes two key structural factors such as centralization and formalization [ 77 [ . They are recognized as key variables underlying the structural construct . More - over , their effects on knowledge management within organizations are widely recog - nized to be potent [ 29 , 59 , 72 . 91 ] . People are at the heart of creating organizational knowledge [ 15 , 49 , 80 ] . It is people who create and share knowledge . Therefore , managing people who are willing to create and share knowiedge is important [ 85 ] . Knowledge and competence can be acquired by admitting new people with desirable skills [ 108 ] . In particular , T - shaped skills embodied in employees are most often associated with core capability [ 56 , 60 , 70 ] . T - shaped skills may enable individual specialists to have synergistic conversa - tions with one another [ 74 ] . Technology contributes to knowledge management [ 35 ] . This technology infra - structure includes IT and its capabilities [ 90 , 99 ] . IT is widely employed to connect people with reusable codified knowledge , and it facilitates conversations to create new knowledge . Among technology - related variables , this study focuses on IT sup - port [ 108 ] . ITs allow an organization to create , share , store , and use knowledge [ 70 ] . Therefore , the support of IT is essential for initiating and carrying out knowledge management . Enablers may be structured based upon a socio - technical theory [ 86 ] . This theory describes an organization from the social and technical perspectives . The two per - spectives are not unique to management information systems CMIS ) research [ 12 ] ; they are made up of two jointly independent but correlative interacting components . Organizational culture , organizational structure , and people are social enablers ; IT is KM ENABLERS , PROCESSES , AND ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE 189 a technical enabler . For the sake of clarity , we consider the impact of each knowledge enabler independently . Processes A number of studies bave addressed knowledge management processes ; they divide knowledge management into several processes . For example . Alavi and Leidner 12 ] considered four processes such as creation , storage , transfer , and application . These processes are often concurrent and not always in a linear sequence 19 ] . Among these processes , creation - related activities ( for example , creation [ 2 ] or construction [ 21 ] ) become important because knowledge creation is a strategic weapon in today ' s global marketplace ; without the constant creation of knowledge , a business is condemned to obsolescence [ 83 , 87 ] . Knowledge creation is a continuous process whereby individuals and groups within a firm and between firms share tacit and ex - plicit knowledge | 82 ] . Although a great deal has been discussed about the importance of knowledge creation , there is relatively little empirical evidence [ 90 ] . Therefore , the emphasis of this study is on knowledge creation . To explore knowledge creation , our study adopts the SECl ( socialization , externalization . combination , internalization ) model by Nonaka and Takeuchi [ 82 | for the following reasons . First , their work has become widely accepted [ 98 ] ; it has been used in many research areas such as organizational learning , new product devel - opment , and IT [ 98 , 99 ] . Second , their model includes not only knowledge creation but also knowledge transfer . The transfer of existing knowledge and the creation of new knowledge are important , and both of them should be considered in knowiedge management [ 69 ] . Their SECI model is made up of four intertwined activity modes ; socialization ( S ) , externalization ( E ) , combination ( C ) , and internalization ( I ) . Social - ization converts tacit knowledge into new tacit knowledge through social interactions among members . Externalization codifies tacit knowledge into explicit concepts . Com - bination converts explicit knowledge into more systematic sets by combining key pieces . Internalization embodies explicit knowledge into tacit knowledge . Intermediate Outcome In order to achieve a better understanding of knowledge management performance , companies should attempt to link knowledge processes with intermediate outcomes [ 18 ] . An important intermediate outcome is organizational creativity , which pro - vides a key to the understanding of organizational effectiveness and survival [ 122 ] . Our model incorporates organizational creativity because it is the seed of all innova - tion [ 5 ] and at the very heart of knowledge management [ 40 ] . Organizational cre - ativity transforms knowledge into business value . Neglecting organizational creativity can quickly undermine a business . The relationship between knowledge creation and organizational creativity bas received relatively little attention despite its high potential [ 119 ] . 190 LEE AND CHOI Organizational Performance Measuring organizational performance is not a trivial task because it strongly affects the behavior of managers and employees . The ultimate test of any business is whether it leads to measurable improvements in organizational performance . Methods for measuring organizational performance in knowledge management can be categorized into four groups : financial measures [ 11 ] , intellectual capital [ 110 ] , tangible and intangible benefits [ 104 ] , and balanced scorecard 163 ] . This study adopts a specific measure , which is developed and validated by Deshpande el al . [ 22 ] and Drew [ 25 ] . This measure can be thought of as a variation ofthe balanced scorecard method . The balanced scorecard retains fmancial performance and supplements it with measures on the drivers of future potential . In addition , it is more useful than intellectual capital or a tangible and intangible approach because it shows cause and effect links between knowledge components and organization strategies [ 63 ] . In summary , our empirical research model illustrates the relationship among vari - ables as shown in Figure 3 . In total , the model consists of 13 variables . Hypotheses Our hypotheses are largely derived from theoretical statements made in the litera - ture on knowledge management . We present our hypotheses through the following variables . Collaboration Collaboration may be defined as the degree to which people in a group actively help one another in their work [ 55 ] . Collaborative culture affects knowledge creation through increasing knowledge exchange [ 68 , 79 ] . Exchanging knowledge among different members is a prerequisite for knowledge creation . Collaborative culture fosters this type of exchange by reducing fear and increasing openness to other members . For example , Zucker et al . [ 126 ] confirmed the significance of collaborative culture in knowledge creation by examining the biotechnology industry . Collaboration between organizational members also tightens individuai differences [ 70 ] . It can help people develop a shared understanding about an organization ' s external and internal envi - ronments through supportive and reflective communication . Without shared under - standing among organizational members , little knowledge is ever created 130 , 47 ] . We do not have a priori reason to expect a diflerent relationship . HI : There is a positive relationship between collaboration and knowledge cre - ation process . Trust Trust can be defined as maintaining reciprocal faith in each other in terms of intention and behaviors [ 67 ] . Trust may facilitate open , substantive , and influential knowiedge KM EN .

A Research Model exchange [ 81 , 85 ] . When their relationships are high in trust , people are more willing to participate in knowledge exchange [ 79 ] . Szulanski [ 1141 empirically found that the lack of trust among employees is one of the key barriers against knowledge ex - change . The increase in knowledge exchange brought on by mutual trust results in knowledge creation . Trust also encourages a climate conducive to better knowledge creation by alleviating the fear of risk . The presence of a high level of trust can reduce this risk [ 81 , 92 , 100 ] . Trust is also critical in a cross - functional or interorganizationa ! team because withholding information because of a lack of trust can be especially harmful to knowledge creation [ 47 , 59 ] . Therefore , we would expect the following relationship to hold true : H2 : There is a po . sitive relationship hetween trust and knowledge creation process . Learning Learning can be defined as the degree to which it is encouraged in organizations [ 55 ] . The emphasis on learning infuses an organization with new knowledge 117 ] . Learning is the acquisition of new knowledge by people who are able and willing to apply that knowledge in making decisions or influencing others [ 78 ] . Through the emphasis on learning and development , organizations can help individuals play more active roles in knowledge creation . Kanevsky and Housel [ 62 ] insisted that the amount of time spent on learning is positively related with the amount of knowledge . For successful knowledge creation , organizations should develop a deeply ingrained learning culture 192 LEE AND CHOI [ 88 ] and provide various learning means such as education , training , and mentoring [ 112 , 113 ] . For example , Nucor [ 39 ] , which has been the most innovative steel com - pany in the United States , built a knowledge creation foundation by investing in con - tinuous and multifunctional training programs . Hence , we hypothesize : H3 : There is a positive relationship between learning and knowledge creation process . Centralization Centralization refers to the locus of decision authority and control within an organi - zational entity [ 14 , 27 ] . The concentration of decision - making authority inevitably reduces creative solutions , wbereas the dispersion of power facilitates spontaneity , experimentation , and the freedom of expression , which are the lifeblood of knowl - edge creation [ 37 ] . Moreover , centralized structure hinders interdepartmental com - munication and frequent sharing of ideas [ 122 ] due to time - consuming communication channels [ 10 ] ; it also causes distortion and discontinuou . sness of ideas [ I08 | . Without a constant flow of communication and ideas , knowledge creation does not occur . A decentralized organizational structure has been found to facilitate an environment where employees participate in knowledge building process more spontaneously [ 52 ] . Participatory work environments foster knowledge creation by motivating organiza - tional members ' involvements . Therefore , decreased centralization in the form of lo - cus of authority can lead to increased creation of knowledge [ 106 , 108 . 115 ] . We advance the fourth hypothesis : H4 : There is a negative relationship between centralization and knowledge cre - ation process . Formatization Formalization refers to the degree to which decisions and working relationships are governed by formal rules , standard policies , and procedures [ 49 , 89 | . Knowledge creation requires flexibility and less emphasis on work rules [ 57 , 73 ] . The range of new ideas seems to be restricted when strict formal rules dominate an organization . Flexibility can accommodate better ways of doing things [ 37 ] . Therefore , the in - creased flexibility in an organizational structure can result in increased creation of knowledge . Knowledge creation also requires variation [ 121 ] . In order to be more adaptable when unforeseen problems arise , an organization may accommodate varia - tion in process and structure . Low formalization permits openness and variation , which encourage new ideas and behaviors [ 17 ] . Knowledge creation is also likely to be encouraged through unhindered communications and interactions [ 10 ] . Formality stifles the communication and interaction necessary to create knowledge . Lack of formal structure tends to enable organizational members to communicate and interact with one another to create knowledge 159 ] . Hence , we hypothesize : KM ENABLERS . PROCESSES . AND ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE 193 H5 : There is a negative rvlationship between formalization and knowledge cre - ation process . T - Shaped Skills T - shaped skills are both deep ( the vertical part of the ' T " ) and broad ( the horizontal part ofthe " T ' ) ; that is , their possessors can explore particular knowledge domains and their various applications in particular products [ 70 ] . For example , persons with T - shaped skills not only have a deep knowledge of a discipline ( like ceramic materi - als engineering ) , but also know how their discipline interacts with other disciplines ( such as polymer processing ) 156 ] . People with T - shaped skills are extremely valu - able for creating knowledge because tbey can integrate diverse knowledge assets [ 70 ] . They have the ability both to combine theoretical and practical knowledge and to see how their branch of knowledge interacts with other brancbes . Therefore , they can expand their competence across several functional branch areas , and thus create new kjiowledge [ 60 , 74 ] . H6 : There is a positive relationship between the presence of the organizational members with T - shaped skills and knowledge creation process . IT Support IT support means the degree to which knowledge management is supported by the use of ITs [ 35 | . Many researchers have found that IT is a crucial element for knowl - edge creation [ 19 , 36 , 39 ] . IT affects knowledge in a variety of ways . First , IT facili - tates rapid collection , storage , and exchange of knowledge on a scale not practicable in tbe past , thereby assisting the knowledge creation process [ 92 ] . Second , a well - developed technology integrates fragmented flows of knowledge [ 35 ] . This integra - tion can eliminate barriers to communication among departments in organization . Third , IT fosters all modes of knowledge creation and is not limited to the transfer of explicit knowledge [ 90 , 91 , 99 ) . For instance , InfoTEST ' s enhanced product realiza - tion ( EPR ) project employs electronic whiteboarding and videoconferencing to en - hance exchanges of tacit knowledge [ 91 ] . Thus , we hypothesize : H7 : There is a positive relationship between IT support and knowledge creation process . Organizational Creativity Organizational creativity is the capability of creating valuable and useful products , services , ideas , or procedures by individuals working together in a complex social system [ 5 , 122 ] . Knowledge plays an important role in the ability of the organization to be creative [ 1191 . Thus , organizations with better knowledge diffusion and creat - ing mechanisms are more intelligent [ 34 | . Organizational creativity also connects and rearranges knowledge to create new , often surprising ideas that others judge to be 194 LEE AND CHOI useful [ 65 ] . Creativity is not necessarily related to tbe amount of knowledge that an employee possesses , but rather the way in which knowledge is created and shared [ 4 ] . The processes of knowledge creation unleash organizational creativity . Naturally , organizational creativity has a strong link with knowledge creation [ 119 ] . H8 : There is a positive relationship between the knowledge creation process and organizational creativity . Organizational Performance In our study , organizational peribrmance is assessed hy the use of global output mea - sures such as market share , profitability , growth rate , innovativeness . successfulness , and the size of business in comparison with key competitors [ 22 , 25 ] . In a knowl - edge - based economy , organizational creativity represents a dramatic organizational change . Robinson and Stern [ 93 ] insisted that the tangible results of corporate cre - ativity are the organizational change such as improvements ( changes to what is al - ready done ) and innovations ( entirely new activities for the company ) , Without creativity , organizations may fail to adapt to changing internal and external condi - tions | 88 [ , and thus lose their knowledge advantage . Typically , the goals of organiza - tional change include the various aspects of organizational peribrmance such as organizational effectiveness , survival , improvement , or innovation . Organizational performance can be thought of as the output of a process that encourages creativity [ 97 ] . Thus , improvements of creativity might lead to better organizational perfor - mance [ 18 , 88 , 102 ] . We hypothesize that : H9 : There is a positive relationship between organizational creativity and orga - nizational performance . Sample and Measures SAMPLES WERE RESTRICTED TO THE LISTED COMPANIES in order to include major companies in Korea . Annual Corporation Reports by Maeil Business Newspaper [ 75 ] is the source for sampling because it analyzes all listed companies in the Korea Stock Exchange . Therefore , the unit of analysis in this study is the organization . We adopted both interviews and mail surveys . Interviews were used to investigate the current detailed status of knowledge management . This investigation included knowledge management practices such as the number of communities of practice , the rate of use of tbe knowledge management system , and the cost of investment in knowledge man - agement activities . Although interview data is not analyzed statistically , they were valuable for our interpretation . After the interview , a questionnaire - based survey was conducted . Questionnaires were administered to a total of 1 , 425 middle managers in 147 organizations . Depend - ing on each individual firm ' s size , five to 15 middle managers were surveyed from each firm . Middle managers were reached through their CEOs or CIOs . A typical job title of a middle manager was department chief . Middle managers were surveyed KM ENABLERS . PROCESSES . AND ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE 195 because they played key roles in managing knowledge . Middle managers are posi - tioned at the intersection of the vertical and horizontal flows of knowiedge . Thus , they can synthesize the tacit knowledge of both top managers and frontline employ - ees , make it explicit , and incorporate it into new products and services [ 82 | . A multiple - item method was used to construct the questionnaires . Each item was based on a six - point Likert scale , from " very low " to " very high . " Likert scales as generally used tend to underestimate the extreme positions [ 3 ] . Respondents are re - luctant to express an extreme position even if they have it . They tend to please the interviewer , appear helpful , or respond in what they perceive to be a socially accept - able answer . Resorting to a scale without a midpoint seems to help mollify this social desirability bias without changing the direction of opinion [ 32 ] . The six - point Likert scale avoids a midpoint , which prevents respondents from using a neutral default option [ 5 ] . The questionnaires were written in Korean . Research constructs were operationalized on the basis of related studies and pilot tests . The operational definitions of instruments and their related literature are sum - marized in Appendix A . Most of the research constructs have already been validated and used for other studies on knowledge management , organizational design , learn - ing , or IT management . For example , formalization items have already been vali - dated and used by Caruana et al . 114 ] and Rapert and Wren [ 89 ] . Self - reported items have been used to assess organizational performance [ 22 , 25 ] . Although these items do not pre . sent a fully balanced scorecard , they are effective for comparing business units and industries [ 25 ] . Questionnaire items for the knowledge creation process , which were used in this study , had been validated and used by Nonaka et al . 183 ] . Analysis Sample Characteristics IN TOTAL , 451 QUESTIONNAIRES FROM 63 out of 147 firms were returned ( 43 percent response rate ) . The rates from individual firms ranged from 23 to 100 percent . Due to incomplete data , 25 responses from five tirms were eliminated . Consequently , 426 responses from 58 firms were analyzed . Table 2 summarizes the respondent charac - teristics in terms of industry type , departments , total sales revenue , and number of total employees . Samples are divided into three industry types : manufacturing , service , and finan - cial business ( banking , finance , insurance ) . The majority of these firms are in the service industry . Thirty - two firms have annual total sales revenue of $ 1 billion or more , and 31 firms have 1 , 000 employees or more . As mentioned previously , samples were collected from various middle managers . Reliability and Validity Analysis Table 3 presents the results of reliability and validity tests .

PROCESSES , AND ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE 201 were performed on the 20 items for the knowledge creation processes , on the five items for organizational creativity , and on the six items for organizational perfor - mance . Cronbach ' s alpha is used for examining the reliability of the instruments . A higher cutoff value of 0 . 7 may be used because these instruments have been adopted previously [ 84 ] . All constructs had higher than 0 . 7 cutoff alpha value , ranging from 0 . 8309 to 0 . 9203 . For convergent validity , items having item - to - total correlation scores lower than 0 . 4 were dropped from further analysis . One item relating to organiza - tional perfonnance had an item - to - total correlation of less than 0 . 4 and thus was elimi - nated from further analysis . Factor analysis is used to check discriminant validity [ 64 ] . Because each variable was measured by multi - item constructs , factor analysis with varimax was adopted to check the unidimensionality among items . Items with factor loading values lower than 0 . 5 were deleted . There was one item with factor loading of lower than 0 . 5 for the knowledge creation processes . A factor analysis for the knowledge enablers and knowledge creation processes is shown in Table 4 . Relatively high values of reliabil - ity and validity imply that the instruments used in this study are adequate . All the measures used in this study are reported in Appendix B . Inter - Rater Reliability atid Agreement Atialysis Whereas the unit of analysis in this study is the organization , the questionnaire was distributed to organizational members to measure characteristics of their organiza - tions . Therefore , answers from the same organization should be aggregated and used as an organizational indicator . Given the perceptual nature of the measures and the conversion of individual responses into organizational indicators , inter - rater reliabil - ity and agreement analysis are necessary [ 118 ] . Inter - rater reliability is defined as an index of consistency , which represents consistency of variance among raters [ 66J . In contrast , agreement is defined as the interchangeability among raters , which addresses the extent to which raters make the same ratings f58 ] . The inter - rater reliability was as . sessed by the use of the interclass correlation coef - ficient ( ICC ) . Because each company was rated by a different rater and their ratings were averaged , ICC { I , k ) was appropriate . ICC ( i , k ) is calculated by one - way analy - sis of variance ( ANOVA ) [ 103 ] . James et al . f58 | developed indices appropriate for within - group agreement for a set of raters rating a single target with a single item t ^ gcn ) or multiple - item scale ( r ^ ^ y , ) - For our study , r ^ . g ^ J ^ is adopted . Table 5 summa - rizes the results of inter - rater reliability and agreement . A number of management studies suggest that ICC ranging from 0 . 512 to 0 . 991 and r„ , ^ , _ „ ranging from 0 . 69 to 0 . 96 [ 5 , 46 ] are appropriate . Our results are consistent with these ICC and r ^ . ^ , j , ranges , and thus inter - rater reliability and agreement may be guaranteed .

Therefore , the knowledge creation process is considered as an aggregated variable , and its correlation is computed . We then test each hypothesis to fmd which enablers are more important for knowledge creation and which processes are more important for organizational performance . To meet the assumptions of regression analysis , we examined Ihe linearity , constant variance , and normality | 42 ] . Because the scatterplots of individual variables do not indicate any nonlinear relationships , the linearity is guaranteed . Plotting the studentized residuals against the predicted value shows that no variable violates the constant vari - ance . The result from the normal probability plot and Kolmogorov - Smimov tests indicates no violation of normality ( statistic = 0 . 050 - 0 . 096 . p > 0 . 200 ) . The overall regression model ( for fmding the relationship between the knowledge creation process and enablers ) is significant [ F = 51 . 771 , / 7 < 0 . 000 ) . R - ( 0 . 879 ) sug - gests that 87 . 9 percent of the variance is explained by seven variables . The result of the collinearity test ( VIF = 1 . 429 - 3 . 725 ) shows no multicollinearity problem . Atialysis Results TABLE 6 SUMMARIZES OUR REGRESSION RESULTS . In order to provide a better presen - tation of significant relationships . Figure 5 has been provided . Collaboration , trust , learning , and centralization are found to be relatively significant predictors for knowl - edge creation . Organizational culture variables are found to be essential for knowledge creation . Collaboration is positively related with socialization , extemalization , and intemaliza - tion , whereas it does not affect the combination mode . In particular , trust is a signifi - cant predictor of all knowledge creation modes . Centralization is negatively related with socialization , extemalization , and internalization while it is not significantly re - lated with combination .

Second , it fo - cuses on relatively large and profitable firms . The results may differ in small or venture firms . Finally , tbe results are limited to Korean firms . Tbe generalizability from a Korean setting to other countries may be questionable . Implications Our results can belp managers establish distinctive strategic positions . Knowledge management strategies can be described along two dimensions to reflect knowledge management focus [ 45 ] . One dimension refers to knowledge sharing via interper - sonal interaction . The other dimension refers to the capability to help create , store , share , and use an organization ' s explicitly documented knowledge . The former is more affected by socialization , and the latter is more affected by combination [ 16 ] . Knowledge management strategists can sbarpen weak knowledge management di - mensions on the basis of enablers mentioned in our study . Table 7 highlights tbese implications . The following is a further discussion of these implications . Our findings confirm that knowledge creation is associated with cultural factors such as collaboration , trust , and learning . For instance , groups are most creative when their members collaborate ; members stop holding back when they have mutual trust [ 54 ] . Shaping cultural factors is crucial for a firm ' s ability to manage its knowledge effectively [ 15 , 20 . 35 , 71 ] . Forexample , our interview witb an executive of a confec - tionery company highlights this point . Tbe executive pointed out that their employees did not just use tbe manual or otber codified supports . It was noted that they preferred to depend on their own experiences and networking relationships . A trust - based cul - ture is the foundation for their knowledge management initiative . However , many knowledge management projects , in reality , focus on IT [ 19 , 35 , 111 ] . An organization may face difficulties in building its knowledge creating envi - ronment due to the lack of adequate culture despite its well - constructed IT [ 23 , 72 ] . Stein and Zwass [ 107 [ insisted that successful information systems should be condi - tioned by a number of cultural factors such as organizational values and appropriate learning methods . Initiating knowledge management only through IT can be a risky proposition [ 19 ] . Our analysis confirms that IT support affects combination . There are several re - sourees for a sound understanding of the impact of IT on knowledge combination [ 82 , 1001 . Tbis finding highlights tbe characteristics of knowledge combination . IT is critical for codifying explicit knowledge : it provides fast feedback for explicit knowl - edge [ 69 , 120 ] . In order to support knowledge combination , the question is not whether to deploy IT , but bow to deploy it . Interestingly , our analysis also reveals that trust affects combination . Tbis result implies tbat simply improving the IT infrastructure does not provide a competitive advantage for knowledge combination . Througb in - terviews witb executives in the disk industry in the United States . Scott [ 100 ] found that communication of even explicit knowledge is difficult without a solid founda - 211 Q .

Managers should pay careful attention to the potential impact of IT on knowledge comhination with the consideration of trust in a firm . The nonsignificant findings in this study also bear some implication . Several stud - ies have come to the conclusion that formalization weakens knowledge management [ 57 , 106 ] . In contrast , our study shows no relationship between formali / ation and knowledge creation . This rather intriguing result reflects the two different aspects of formalization . According to the ambidextrous model , which is based on the distinc - tion between the initiation and implementation stages of innovation [ 26 . 94 ] , formal - ization may inhibit tacit - related activities such as socialization ( [ i = - 0 . 052 ) and externalization { p = - 0 . 1165 ) , but may encourage explicit - related activities such as combination ( P = 0 . 0018 ) and internalization ( p = O . I 152 ) . However , this interpreta - tion needs further exploration because ail [ i values are not statistically significant . In particular , a more careful investigation of externalization is of interest . Externali - zation involves the expression of tacit knowledge [ 8 ] . From this perspective , a formal organizational structure may inhihit spontaneity and freedom of expression neces - sary for externalization [ 10 ] . In our study , Ihe emphasi . s of externalization is on tacit knowledge , and thus externalization is negativeiy associated with formalization . How - ever , extemalization may also involve conversion of tacit into expiicit knowledge [ 8 ] . The formal structure can facilitate the rapid and continuous conversion of tacit into explicit knowledge [ 37 ] . If the conversion process or its technoiogy perspective of externalization is emphasized like Becerra - Femandez and Sahherwal [ 8 ] , we may speculate that fumialization can affect extemali / ation positively . Many studies suggested that T - shaped skills positively influence knowledge cre - ation [ 60 , 70 , 74 ) . However , our study shows no relationship between T - shaped skills and knowledge creation . This contradiction may reflect the importance of T - shaped management systems . T - shaped management systems attempt to break out ofthe tra - ditional corporate hierarchy and encourage people to share knowledge 144 ] . How - ever , most current formal organizational incentives encourage l - shaped skills ( the deep functional experti . se ) in isolation [ 70 [ . Without an environment in which T - shaped skills flourish , people with T - shaped skills will not attempt to create new knowledge . It implies that a crucial element of successful knowledge management is not T - shaped skills themselves , but the systematic management of these skills . It would be expected that technologies could facilitate knowledge creation . How - ever , our result shows that IT support is not significantly related with knowledge cre - ation except for combination . It seems that IT does not support all modes of knowledge creation directly . Although groupware , intranet , or videoconferencing can help col - laborative works , this technologically facilitated communication cannot replace face - to - face contact for tacit - to - tacit knowledge transfer [ 53 ] . Accessing the tacit knowledge such as knowledge inside employees ' heads is not possible simply by an intranet or a datahase | 23 ] . That is , the current state of IT may not affect socialization , externalization , or internalization directly . Our study shows that organizational creativity affects organizational performance ( P = 0 . 6338 , p < 0 . 01 ) . This resuU is in line with previous studies [ 73 , 1021 . For example , Shani et al . 1102J provided a framework linking organizational performance KM ENABLERS , PROCESSES , AND ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE 215 and organizational creativity through a field study ofthe Seagate Corporation . It im - plies that managers pay more attention to organizational creativity in order to im - prove organizational performance . Although the relationship is statistically significant , the percentage of total variation of organizational pertbrmance explained by organi - zational creativity is relatively low ( R - = 0 . 402 ) . This may reflect the creativity para - dox [ 116 ] . If creativity is encouraged and reinforced at the expense of operational behaviors , it may decrease organizational perfonnance . That is , organizational cre - ativity is valuable , but its overencouragement may not be always useful . Conclusions OUR STUDY IS OF INTEREST FROM BOTH theoretical and practical perspectives . Theoretically , a framework is proposed for empirical studies to link knowledge management enablers and processes with organizational performance . This study is probably the first to establish this integrative view of knowledge management . We adopt a process - oriented perspective of knowledge by using Nonaka ' s creation model [ 82 ] . Our framework may be used as a stepping stone for further empirical research on knowledge management . To strengthen the feasibility of this framework , we can clarify the role of knowledge creation process ( see Appendix C ) and intermediate outcome ( see Appendix D ) . From a practical point of view , the relationships among knowledge creation , orga - nizational creativity , and organizational performance may provide a clue as to how firms can adjust knowledge creation processes to sustain their performance . Further - more , managers will he better able to find which enablers are critical for knowledge creation . Because firms may not manage all modes of knowledge creation , they may need robust strategies that involve trade - offs . The current findings of this study may indicate the following avenues for further research . First , an analysis of different factors such as domain knowledge [ 101 ] or other types of knowledge process may lead to interesting implications . For example , an interesting candidate is Szulanski ' s knowledge transfer model , which is made up of four processes—initiation , implementation , ramp - up , and integration [ 114 ] . Sec - ond , our study shows which knowledge enablers can enhance a firm ' s capability to manage knowledge . Appropriate knowledge management strategies may be ahle to facilitate these enablers . Finding these strategies may be of interest . Third , what is the effect of our fmdings on electronic commerce ? Electronic commerce is changing the business world rapidly . The quality of knowledge management may determine a suc - cess template for electronic commerce . For example , Holsapple and Singh [ 50 ] pro - posed the potential benefits of applying knowledge management principles to electronic commerce . Finally , other types of performance measures may sharpen the results of our study . ROP ( return on ideas , return on information , and return on investment ) [ 73 ] or a strategy map [ 63 ] is a good alternative .

Note : * Linkage between knowledge creation constructs and our questionnaire items . Questionnaire items for the knowledge creation process , wbicb were used in this study , had been validated and used by Nonaka et al . [ 83 ] . They conducted a confirma - tory factor analysis to test Nonaka ' s | 82 ] organizational knowledge creation model with data collected from 105 Japanese middle managers . Results of the study suggest that the construct of knowledge creation consists of four knowledge conversion pro - cesses ; socialization , externalization , combination , and internalization . All four knowl - edge conversion processes explain a high amount of variance in the knowledge creation 226 LEE AND CHO ! construct . Four factors constitute the process of converting tacit to tacit knowledge ; accumulation of tacit knowledge , extra - firm social information gathering activities , intra - firm social information gathering activities , and transfer of tacit knowledge from the master to the different team members . Externalization process is made up of one factor . This result differs from Nonaka ' s theory that hypothesized that metapbor and dialogue would be retained . Combination process consists of three factors that repre - sent a three - step sequence of data processing : acquisition and integration of informa - tion , synthesis and processing of information , and dissemination of information . Explicit knowledge in the organization may be converted into tacit knowledge ( inter - nalization ) in two different ways ; personal experience in which knowledge is ac - quired from real world , and simulation and experimentation in which knowledge is acquired from tbe virtual world . KM ENABLERS . PROCESSES . AND ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE 227 Appendix C . Mediating Effect of Knowledge Creation Process OUR STUDY HINTS THAT KNOWLEDGE CREATION process mediates between enablers and organizational creativity . However , some recent studies regard both knowiedge enablers and knowledge creation process as antecedents of organizational perfor - mance [ 8 , 35 ] ; that is . both of them are independent variables of organizational per - formance . Therefore , in order to test the mediating effect of knowledge creation process , the Baron and Kenny | 7 | procedure is adopted . Table Al shows this analysis result . This results in the mediation effect because tbe following three conditions hold . First , ktiowledge enablers affect knowledge creation process significantly . It has been noted that collaboration , trust , leaming . and centralization affect creation . However , tbis is not the case with formalization . T - shaped skills , and IT support ; we could not assess the mediating effect for these three enablers . Second , collaboration , trust , leaming . and centralization affect organizational creativity . Tbird . knowledge creation process affects creativity ( p = 0 . 7042 ) while the effects of the previous four enablers are re - duced . For example , in the case of collaboration , its beta value is reduced from 0 . 2144 to 0 . 1316 . In sum , we may point out that knowiedge creation process mediates be - tween the four enablers ( collaboration , trust . learning , and centralization ) and organi - zational creativity . Table Al .

Mediating Effect of Intermediate Outcome IN ORDER TO VALIDATE WHETHER an intemiediate outcome is an important predictor of knowledge management or not , anotber model without organizational creativity is built to explore the direct relationship between knowledge creation and organiza - tional perfonnance . Testing tbis direct relationship indicates no significant relation - ships except for socialization ( p = 0 . 540 , p < 0 . 05 ) . This result is consistent with the previous study [ 181 . lt implies that the intermediate outcome can help build a chain of credibility between knowledge creation and organizational performance . Although not the focus of this study , it is of interest to note an altemative concurrent model in organization theory . Tbis model would posit that efficiency and bureaucratic ( or mechanistic ) structures would chain through to oiganizational performance . For example , centralization can lead to efficiency because it prevents a strategic vacuum of organizations and enables tbe development of precise control prtxredures 130 ] . In addi - tion , formalization has been found to lead to efficiency because it may facilitate the rapid and continuous transformation of ideas into superior products and services and enhance communication flow through tbeir extensive monitoring and reporting require - ments r36 | . Similarly , standardizing business practices may encourage efficiency 148 ] . Related to an interplay between creativity ( flexibility ) and efficiency , it bas been assumed tbat a firm must either focus on efficiency or flexibility [ 33 , 123 ] . That is . flexibility ( or efficiency ) can only be achieved at the cost of efficiency ( or flexibility ) . Therefore , . some researchers have concentrated on improving efficiency [ 125 ] whereas others bave focused on bow to improve flexibility and creativity [ 13 ] . However , there are now a few studies that have suggested that it is possible to be simultaneously efficient and flexible 124 , 3 ! ] . Organizations can obtain their com - petitive advantages through achieving efficiency by emphasizing control as well as flexibility ( creativity ) by creating knowledge [ 117 ] . Case studies such as Microsoft 148 ] , Unilever [ 691 , and NUMMI ( aToyota subsidiary ) [ I ] have shown this simulta - neous approach . These studies suggest that balancing between imposing discipiine for efficiency and delegating authority to encourage flexibility and creativity pro - vides tremendous benefits for organizations . In summary , . some studies insist that efficiency and flexibility are mutually exclu - sive , whereas others argue that they are perfectly compatible . Our study focuses on creativity ( flexibility ) only . The interplay between these creativity forces and efficiency forces should be further investigated in the field of knowledge management . For ex - ample . Kiogh et al . [ 69 ] indicated that knowledge management allows an organization to improve both its efficiency and flexibility ( innovation ) capabilities simultaneously .
