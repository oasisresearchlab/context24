Without feedback mechanisms relaying information about cell shape to the polarity molecular machinery , the coordination between cell polarization and morphogenesis , movement or growth would not be possible . Here we theoretically and computationally study the role of a genetically - encoded mechanical feedback ( in the Cell Wall Integrity Pathway ) as a potential coordination mechanism between cell morphogenesis and polarity during budding yeast mating projection growth . We developed a coarse - grained continuum description of the coupled dynamics of cell polarization and morphogenesis as well as 3D stochastic simulations of the molecular polarization machinery in the evolving cell shape . Both theoretical approaches show that in the absence of mechanical feedback ( or in the presence of weak feedback ) , cell polarity cannot be maintained at the projection tip during growth , with the polarization cap wandering off the projection tip , arresting morphogenesis . In contrast , for mechanical feedback strengths above a threshold , cells can robustly maintain cell polarization at the tip and simultaneously sustain mating projection growth . These results indicate that the mechanical feedback encoded in the Cell Wall Integrity pathway can provide important positional information to the molecular machinery in the cell , thereby enabling the coordination of cell polarization and morphogenesis . Author summary Cell migration , morphogenesis and secretion are among the vast number of cellular processes that require cells to define a preferred spatial direction to perform essential May 15 , 2020 1 / 18 tasks . This is achieved by setting an intracellular molecular gradient that polarizes the cell . While the molecular players involved in cell polarization and some of the mechanisms that cells use to establish such molecular gradients are known , it remains unclear how cells maintain polarization as they dramatically change shape during morphogenesis , migration , etc . Here we identify a potential feedback control mechanism , encoded genetically in cells , that provides the molecular polarization machinery with the necessary information about cell geometry to maintain cell polarization during cell shape changes . Introduction 1 Cell polarization is essential to a large number of cellular processes . From cell migration 2 in animal cells to the growth of walled cells from plants and fungi , cells need to spatially 3 polarize to perform key functions [ 1 – 7 ] . In many cases , an external cue , such as a 4 molecular gradient , triggers the molecular polarization of the cell . Once polarity is 5 established , cells need to maintain polarization at specific spatial locations on the cell 6 surface to properly change shape or move in the right direction , suggesting the existence 7 of a coordination mechanism between the molecular polarization machinery and the 8 physical / geometrical changes of the cell . In animal cells , it has been proposed that 9 membrane tension could help such coordination [ 1 , 8 – 10 ] , but no specific coordination 10 mechanisms are known [ 7 , 11 , 12 ] . More generally , very little is known about the 11 mechanisms that provide the molecular polarization machinery with the necessary 12 information about cell geometry and how such polarization machinery coordinates with 13 cell shape changes . 14 During polarized ( tip ) growth in walled cells , a process occurring in many different 15 species ranging from plants and fungi to bacteria , cells must maintain polarity at the 16 growing apex [ 13 – 17 ] . An example of this process is mating projection growth in 17 budding yeast , Saccharomyces cerevisiae ( Fig . 1a ) . During mating , a - cells and α - cells 18 secrete pheromones , a factor and α factor , respectively , to attract the opposite cell type 19 [ 18 – 20 ] . G protein coupled receptors , Ste2 , on the cell surface bind pheromone 20 molecules , triggering a cascade of reactions ultimately leading to the spatial localization 21 of the polarity master regulator Cdc42 ( Fig . 1b ) . In turn , Cdc42 recruits Bni1 , a formin , 22 which initiates the nucleation of actin cables from the polarization cap ( Fig . 1c ) . These 23 actin cables focus transport to the polarization cap , bringing more Cdc42 as well as the 24 enzymes to synthesize and remodel the cell wall ( Fig . 1d ) . This process induces the 25 localized growth of the mating projection in the direction of maximal pheromone 26 gradient . 27 While cell polarization and subsequent mating projection growth do occur in the 28 presence of pheromone gradients , a graded cue is not necessary . If the distribution of 29 α - factor is uniform ( no gradient ) , the molecular polarization machinery has been shown 30 to be able to spontaneously break the symmetry and polarize the cell [ 21 ] , albeit in a 31 random spatial direction . Upon polarization , a mating projection emerges from the 32 polarization cap , which is maintained at the tip of the growing projection as it 33 extends [ 22 ] . In the absence of a pheromone gradient to externally guide cell 34 polarization and cell shape changes , the observation of sustained mating projection 35 growth suggests the existence of a cell autonomous coordination mechanism between 36 cell polarity and cell shape . However , it is unclear what , if any , cell autonomous 37 coordination mechanism is at play during mating projection growth . 38 Many existing models of cell polarization in budding yeast are able to reproduce the 39 spontaneous symmetry breaking and establishment of a polarization cap in a static , 40 spherical cell geometry [ 21 , 23 – 29 ] . However , using 3D simulations of the polarization 41 machinery in non - spherical geometries , we have recently shown that these models 42 May 15 , 2020 2 / 18 Fig 1 .

All variables are defined in the main text . cannot explain the maintenance of cell polarization at the tip of mating projections [ 30 ] . 43 A polarization cap initially localized at the tip of the mating projection , quickly moves 44 away from the tip and localizes out of the mating projection , thereby precluding mating 45 projection growth . In these simulations , the polarization machinery is coupled to the 46 cell geometry because the molecular gradients established inside the cell depend on the 47 cell’s shape and , in turn , these geometry - dependent gradients affect the reaction rates 48 and spatial distribution of polarization molecules at the cell surface . However , this 49 polarization - cell geometry coupling does not help maintain cell polarization at the tip of 50 the mating projection , but rather drives it away from that point [ 30 ] . A different 51 coordination mechanism between cell shape and polarization must thus exist to 52 maintain polarization at the projection tip and sustain mating projection growth . 53 Cell shape and cell wall mechanics are directly related to each other and , therefore , 54 the mechanics of the cell wall contains information about the cell shape . We have 55 recently shown that the sustained growth of a mating projection requires a mechanical 56 feedback between the cell wall synthesis and cell wall mechanics [ 31 ] . This mechanical 57 feedback is genetically encoded in the Cell Wall Integrity ( CWI ) pathway and involves 58 cell wall ”stress” sensors ( Wsc1 , Wsc2 and Mid2 ) activating the rho GTPase Rho1 59 ( Fig . 1e ) , which , in turn , activates cell wall synthesis ( Fks1 / 2 ) , thereby creating a 60 feedback loop between cell wall mechanics ( cell shape ) and cell wall assembly . In 61 addition , Rho1 activation through the CWI pathway also promotes actin cable 62 formation via the local activation of the formin Bni1 ( Fig . 1e ) . Since Cdc42 is 63 transported on actin cables by vesicles , it is possible that the same mechanical feedback 64 shown to stabilize mating projection growth is simultaneously used to maintain cell 65 polarity at the mating projection tip , effectively providing the molecular polarization 66 machinery with the necessary positional information . 67 Unlike previous theoretical descriptions , which either considered the dynamics of 68 polarization in fixed geometries [ 21 , 23 – 29 ] or the mechanics of cell morphogenesis 69 without accounting for polarization [ 31 – 34 ] , here we couple the dynamics of cell 70 polarization and cell wall mechanics during mating projection growth . Using both a 71 coarse - grained theoretical description and 3D stochastic simulations of cell polarization 72 coupled to the mechanics of cell morphogenesis , we show that the mechanical feedback 73 encoded in the CWI pathway can , by itself , coordinate the dynamics of cell polarization 74 and morphogenesis , maintaining the polarization cap at the tip of the mating projection 75 and sustaining mating projection growth . 76 May 15 , 2020 3 / 18 Materials and methods 77 Numerical integration of coarse - grained continuum equations 78 The system of equations was scaled and written in a manner such that r , h , ρ C and ρ A 79 were described by time - dependant equations , and u , θ , κ s by differential equations in s . 80 The latter equations were solved by the method of lines ; s was discretized and the 81 s - derivatives were written as a differential matrix using fourth order central difference 82 and one sided finite differences at the boundary . The resulting system becomes a 83 differential algebraic system ( DAE ) , which was solved using Sundials [ 35 ] , a suite of 84 nonlinear and DAE solvers . Steady state solutions were obtained by ensuring that all 85 time derivatives of scaled variables were below 10 − 3 . 86 Numerical integration of coupled reaction diffusion simulations 87 The mechanics equations were coupled to the reaction diffusion equations . Because of 88 the separation of timescales of the physical growth governed by the mechanics equations 89 and the biochemical reactions governed by the stochastic reaction diffusion equations , 90 we were able to use a split - operator approach to solve the coupled dynamics of cell wall 91 expansion and the molecular polarization . The mechanics equations were solved using 92 the same method presented above for the integration of the coarse - grained continuum 93 equations . The stochastic reaction diffusion equations were built and solved using 94 PyURDME and MOLNs [ 36 ] . Computational 3D meshes for each geometry consisted of 95 a discretization of both the cytoplasm and the membrane ( surface defined by cell 96 shape ) , allowing for diffusion both in the cytoplasm and on the membrane as required 97 by the models used in this study . All reactions took place in voxels on the membrane 98 for each geometry . These meshes were generated using Gmsh [ 37 ] . 99 Results 100 To study the relation between the dynamics of cell polarization and cell morphogenesis 101 during budding yeast mating projection growth , we combine different methodologies . 102 First , we describe the mechanics of cell wall expansion that governs cell shape changes 103 and , in particular , the extension of a mating projection . We then describe the dynamics 104 of cell polarization using two approaches : ( 1 ) a continuum minimal model for the 105 coupling between polarization and mechanics and , ( 2 ) 3D stochastic simulations of the 106 molecular polarization machinery in the growing cell . In both cases , we couple the 107 dynamics of polarization to the mechanics of the cell wall through the feedback encoded 108 in the CWI pathway and study whether cell polarization can be maintained at the tip of 109 the extending mating projection and whether mating projection growth can be 110 sustained by the coupled dynamics . 111 Geometry and mechanics of cell wall expansion during mating 112 projection growth 113 As in any walled organism , the budding yeast cell is surrounded by a thin cell wall 114 ( ∼ 100 nm [ 38 ] ) , much smaller than the characteristic cell size or diameter of the mating 115 projection ( ∼ 1 µ m [ 39 ] ) . The shape of the cell is defined by the location of the cell wall 116 and , during mating projection growth , it can be approximated to be axisymmetric 117 ( Fig . 1a , f ) . The extension of the mating projection can thus be described as the 118 expansion of an axisymmetric thin shell caused by the large cell’s internal turgor 119 pressure , P ( Fig . 1f , g ) . It is convenient to parametrize the geometry of the cell ( cell 120 May 15 , 2020 4 / 18 wall ) by the arclength s from the projection apex and azimuthal angle φ ( Fig . 1f ) . The 121 shape of the growing projection is characterized by its local radius of curvature , r ( s , t ) , 122 and the two principal curvatures κ s = ∂θ / ∂s and κ φ = sin θ / r , respectively , where 123 θ ( s , t ) is the angle between the local outward normal and the axis of growth ( Fig . 1f ) . 124 The coordinates ( r , φ , z ) are standard cylindrical coordinates , and the angle θ and 125 arclength s provide measures of changes in the normal and tangential directions of the 126 surface , ˆ n and ˆ s respectively [ 32 , 40 ] ( Fig . 1f ) . 127 The dynamics of cell wall expansion during growth are governed by mass and 128 momentum conservation , as explained in previous works on tip growth [ 31 , 32 ] and on 129 the expansion of thin viscous shells [ 40 ] . Since inertia is irrelevant in this system , 130 momentum conservation reduces to local force balance on the cell wall , which yields 131 σ ss κ s + σ φφ κ φ = P and σ ss κ φ = P 2 , ( 1 ) where σ ss ( s , t ) and σ φφ ( s , t ) are the tensions along s and φ directions in the wall 132 ( Fig . 1f ) . The rheology ( mechanical properties ) of the cell wall control its expansion in 133 response to the tensions in the wall . While the yeast cell wall in known to behave 134 elastically at short time scales ( seconds [ 38 ] ) , plastic behavior manifested by irreversible 135 cell wall expansion occurs at the growing tip on the timescales of mating projection 136 growth ( minutes [ 41 ] ) . Enzymes that locally degrade the cell wall ( glucanases ) are 137 brought to the polarization cap by exocytic vesicles moving along the actin cables 138 emanating from it [ 42 ] ( Fig . 1d ) . Upon release to the adjacent cell wall , a higher 139 concentration of glucanases degrade more the cell wall adjacent to the polarization cap , 140 creating a gradient of cell wall degradation away from it . This is consistent with the 141 observation of a higher concentration of cell wall degrading enzymes ( glucanases ) near 142 the apex of the mating projection [ 43 ] . Therefore , at the timescales of growth , the cell 143 wall can thus be approximated by a viscous fluid shell with inhomogeneous viscosity , 144 µ ( s , t ) , minimal at the polarization cap and increasing away from it ( Fig . 1g ) . In this 145 case , the local tangential velocity u ( s , t ) along the arclength ( u = (cid:126)u · ˆ s ) of a cell wall 146 with constant density ρ w , or equivalently , its strain ( expansion ) rates ˙ (cid:15) s = ∂u / ∂s and 147 ˙ (cid:15) φ = ( 1 / r ) ( dr / dt ) , are related to the tensions in the cell wall by [ 32 , 40 ] 148 σ ss = 4 µ ( s , t ) h [ ˙ (cid:15) s + ˙ (cid:15) φ / 2 ] and σ φφ = 4 µ ( s , t ) h [ ˙ (cid:15) s / 2 + ˙ (cid:15) φ ] . ( 2 ) Beyond the expansion of the cell wall in response of the tensions in it , new cell wall 149 needs to be assembled as the mating projection grows . The cell wall is assembled via 150 Fks1 / 2 synthases at the plasma membrane that extrude 1 , 3 − β glucans to the 151 preexisting wall [ 44 , 45 ] . Since Fks1 / 2 synthases are also brought to the plasma 152 membrane along actin cables and inserted in it during the exocytosis process , their 153 concentration is high at the polarization cap and decreases away from it , generating a 154 graded distribution G ( s , t ) of the cell wall assembly rate that decreases away from the 155 polarization cap ( Fig . 1g ) . Mass conservation of the cell wall material during mating 156 projection growth yields [ 31 ] 157 ∂ t ( rh ) + ∂ s ( rhu ) = r G ( s , t ) ρ w , ( 3 ) where h ( s , t ) is the cell wall thickness ( Fig . 1e ) and ρ w is the constant cell wall density . 158 The functions µ ( s , t ) and G ( s , t ) depend directly on transport along actin cables and 159 exocytosis , which are controlled by the polarization machinery . We will relate these 160 functions to the dynamics of polarization below . 161 May 15 , 2020 5 / 18 Dynamics of cell polarization : minimal coarse - grained 162 description 163 In order to form a mating projection , the cell must first polarize to specify the site of 164 cell wall growth and expansion . Many molecular players are involved in the cell 165 polarization process [ 46 ] . In our 3D stochastic simulations ( see below ) , we will consider 166 the coupled dynamics of some of the key molecular players in the polarization process . 167 However , since the aim of the coarse - grained description is to study solely the coupling 168 between the dynamics of polarization and the mechanics of cell wall expansion during 169 mating projection growth , we neglect much of the complexity of the polarization 170 molecular machinery in this minimal description . Since the formin Bni1 is directly 171 activated through the CWI pathway , leading to the assembly of actin cables and further 172 recruitment of the master polarity regulator Cdc42 via actin - mediated transport , we 173 consider solely the effective , coupled dynamics of Cdc42 and Bni1 on the curved 174 geometry of the cell . 175 Cdc42 can reach the plasma membrane either through direct binding from a 176 cytoplasmic pool [ 47 , 48 ] or through actin cable - mediated transport , carried by secretory 177 vesicles [ 48 ] . Once at the membrane , Cdc42 diffuses with diffusion coefficient D and 178 also unbinds from the membrane at a rate k D . The Cdc42 population at the plasma 179 membrane acts as a central regulator of many polarization factors [ 47 ] and , in 180 particular , it recruits Bni1 , a formin that drives the nucleation of actin cables [ 49 ] 181 ( Fig . 1c ) . As mentioned above , these actin cables bring many different factors that are 182 essential for cell wall remodeling and growth , as well ad Cdc42 itself , creating a positive 183 feedback loop . Focusing on this feedback between Cdc42 and Bni1 , we can write the 184 dynamics of Cdc42 on the plasma membrane of the mating projection as 185 ∂ t ( rρ C ) − D∂ s ( r∂ s ρ C ) = r [ k X ρ A − k D ρ C ] , ( 4 ) where ρ C is the Cdc42 concentration on the plasma membrane , k X is the rate at which 186 Cdc42 is added to the plasma membrane through transport along actin filaments , and 187 ρ A is the local surface density of actin cables . Since actin cables are nucleated by active 188 Bni , we assume the local density of actin cables emanating from the membrane to be 189 proportional to the local active Bni1 concentration , ρ B , a , at the plasma membrane , 190 namely ρ A ∼ ρ B , a . In this minimal description , we assume a uniform pool of inactive 191 Bni1 on the plasma membrane with concentration ρ B , i = ρ 0 and write the dynamics of 192 active Bni1 as 193 ∂ t ( rρ B , a ) = r [ k R ρ C + k CWI ρ 0 − k I ρ B , a ] , ( 5 ) where k R is the rate at with Cdc42 recruits ( and activates ) Bni1 , k I is the inactivation 194 rate of Bni1 and k CWI is rate of activation of Bni1 through the CWI pathway 195 ( independently of Cdc42 ) [ 50 ] . Activation of the CWI pathway depends on the local 196 mechanical state of the cell wall , leading to a direct coupling between the dynamics of 197 Bni1 and the mechanics of the cell wall . Since CWI activation correlates with locations 198 of cell wall expansion , we write the local activation rate of Bni1 via the CWI as being 199 proportional to the local cell wall expansion ( strain ) rates [ 31 ] , namely 200 k CWI = A CWI [ ˙ (cid:15) s + ˙ (cid:15) φ ] , ( 6 ) where A CWI is a dimensionless constant measuring the strength of the mechanical 201 feedback . 202 In order to fully connect the dynamics of Cdc42 and Bni1 to the mechanics of cell 203 wall expansion during morphogenesis , it is necessary to relate them to the cell wall 204 viscosity µ ( s , t ) and the rate of new cell wall assembly G ( s , t ) . Since cell wall synthases 205 Fks1 / 2 are carried to the plasma membrane through secretory vesicles along actin 206 May 15 , 2020 6 / 18 cables , we write the rate of new cell wall assembly G ( s , t ) to be proportional to the local 207 concentration of actin cables , namely G ( s , t ) = k s ρ A , with k s being the Fks1 / 2 rate of 208 new wall assembly . Similarly , the spatial variations in cell wall viscosity reflect spatial 209 changes in the concentration of glucanases , which are also transported to the cell 210 surface through actin cables . Consequently , we assume the length scale of viscosity 211 variations in the cell wall to be determined by spatial variations in actin cable density , 212 namely µ ( s , t ) = µ 0 exp ( s 2 / λ 2A ) , where λ A is the length scale of the decay in actin cable 213 density from the tip of the mating projection . This indicates that in regions with high 214 concentration of actin cables , the cell wall viscosity is lower , promoting local cell wall 215 expansion in that region . 216 Connecting the cell wall mechanics ( Eqns . 1 - 3 ) to the dynamics of Cdc42 and Bni1 217 ( Eqns . 4 - 5 ) as described above , we solved the coupled dynamics of polarity and cell wall 218 expansion during cell morphogenesis . Scaling length and time with the length scale 219 ( D / k D ) 1 / 2 and time scale k − 1 D , respectively , the stresses in the system with the turgor 220 pressure P and the surface densities of Cdc42 and active Bni1 with ρ 0 , we obtain the 221 relevant dimensionless parameters in the system ( Table 1 ) . The parameters 222 k I / k D , k R / k D , k X / k D have either been measured or estimated and we use their known 223 values ( Supporting Information ) . To explore the role of a potential mechanical feedback 224 between cell wall mechanics and polarization , we study the dynamics of the system 225 upon changes in the feedback strength A CWI , which has not been directly measured . 226 Table 1 . Relevant dimensionless parameters . P ( D / k D ) 1 / 2 ρ w 12 µ 0 k s ρ 0 A CWI k I / k D k R / k D k X / k D Mechanical feedback can maintain cell polarization at mating projection tip 227 We first study the dynamics of polarization in the elongated shape of the growing 228 projection , starting from the geometry of a mating projection . In the absence of 229 mechanical feedback ( A CWI = 0 ) , an initially polarized cell loses its polarization within 230 the typical timescales of molecular polarization processes , as can be seen from the loss 231 in polarization in Cdc42 ( Fig . 2a ) . Since the typical timescales of the molecular 232 processes associated with polarization are shorter than the timescales of physical mating 233 projection growth , cell polarization is lost before any cell shape changes occur . In 234 contrast , if the strength of the mechanical feedback is large enough , cells maintain 235 polarization at the tip of the growing mating projection . Even starting from a uniform 236 distribution of Cdc42 in the mating projection ( not polarized ) , the mere presence of the 237 mechanical feedback polarizes the cell at the tip of the mating projection , enabling the 238 sustained growth of the projection and the maintenance of polarization at the tip during 239 growth ( Fig . 2b ) . In between these two limiting regimes , there is a critical value of the 240 mechanical feedback strength below which the cell is unable to maintain cell 241 polarization ( Fig . 2c ) , eventually leading to a uniform and very low ( vanishing ) 242 concentration of Cdc42 at the plasma membrane . Above the critical value , stable 243 solutions for the polarized state exist and the cell can maintain cell polarization at the 244 tip of the mating projection during growth ( Fig . 2b , c ) . 245 As expected for mating projection growth [ 31 ] , the stable solutions show that the 246 rate of cell surface ( cell wall ) expansion , namely ˙ (cid:15) s + ˙ (cid:15) φ , is maximal at the tip and 247 decays away from it with the characteristic length scale λ D of that defines the polarity 248 cap ( Fig . 2d ) , eventually vanishing far away from the tip , where the cell wall becomes 249 solid - like ( diverging viscosity ; Fig . 1g ) . The presence of mechanical feedback , leads to 250 the localized activation of Bni1 at the tip ( Fig . 2e ) that , in turn , generates a localized 251 ( polarized ) density of actin cables emanating from the tip of the growing mating 252 May 15 , 2020 7 / 18 Fig 2 . Maintenance of cell polarization at the mating projection tip via mechanical feedback . a , A cell initially polarized at the tip , as indicated by the distribution of Cdc42 , loses polarization in the absence of mechanical feedback .

For feedback strengths above a threshold , cell polarization is stably maintained at the tip during cell growth ( Polarized stable solution ) . d - g , Steady state spatial profiles for cell wall expansion rate ˙ (cid:15) s + ˙ (cid:15) φ ( d ) , active Bni1 density ( e ) , Cdc42 density ( f ) and cell wall thickness h ( g ) . projection . This higher density of actin cables at the tip generates higher concentrations 253 of Cdc42 in this region ( Fig . 2f ) , maintaining cell polarization during cell growth . 254 Finally , the cell wall thickness is largely uniform along the mating projection , albeit 255 with a slight thinning at the tip ( Fig . 2g ) , in agreement with experimental 256 observations [ 51 , 52 ] . 257 This minimal description shows that the mechanical feedback between cell wall 258 expansion and Bni1 dynamics encoded in the CWI pathway can maintain cell 259 polarization at regions of the cell surface where cell wall expansion occurs . Since cell 260 wall expansion and cell geometry are related to each other through mass and 261 momentum conservation , this mechanical feedback effectively provides the cell 262 polarization machinery with information on the cell shape ( i . e . , positional information ) . 263 Stochastic simulations of cell polarization during mating 264 projection growth 265 Because the timescales of cell wall expansion and growth ( cell shape changes ) are much 266 longer than the timescales of the molecular reactions involved in cell polarization , we 267 first studied the polarization dynamics by performing stochastic simulations of 268 molecular polarization models in a fixed cell geometry . The shape of the cell with a 269 growing mating projection was obtained from the mechanical description described 270 above , following our previous work [ 31 ] . 271 May 15 , 2020 8 / 18 To perform 3D stochastic simulations of the polarization dynamics in the fixed cell 272 geometry , we employed the previously described PyURDME software [ 36 ] , which can 273 simulate spatial stochastic dynamics on complex 3D and time - dependent geometries . In 274 this stochastic model , we considered both the inactive ( Cdc42 - GDP ) and active 275 ( Cdc42 - GTP ) states of Cdc42 , the local density of actin cables on the membrane and 276 actin monomers in the cytoplasm ( Fig . 3a ) . Inactive Cdc42 in the cytoplasm can directly 277 bind to the membrane at a rate β 2 ( β 2 (cid:39) 0 . 28 µms − 1 [ 28 ] ) or transported to it by actin 278 cables ( at rate β 1 ) , and has a membrane diffusion constant of 0 . 0053 µm 2 s − 1 [ 53 ] . It 279 can also dissociate from the plasma membrane at a rate β 3 ( β 3 (cid:39) 1 s − 1 [ 28 ] ) . At the 280 plasma membrane , inactive Cdc42 can be activated and inactivated at rates 0 . 2 µm 2 s − 1 281 and 1 s − 1 [ 28 ] , respectively . Local assembly of actin cables on the membrane is due to 282 Bni1 activation , which can be caused either by active Cdc42 ( A on (cid:39) 0 . 197 µm 3 s − 1 [ 53 ] ; 283 Fig . 3a ) or by Rho1 through the CWI pathway at a rate that depends on the local cell 284 wall expansion , namely A CWI [ ˙ (cid:15) s + ˙ (cid:15) φ ] ( Fig . 3d ) . Actin filaments disassemble at a rate 285 A off (cid:39) 2 . 70 s − 1 [ 53 ] .

The 3D plots shown in b and e correspond to a single simulation realization , whereas the averaged profiless in c and f contain information of 100 realizations . In the absence of mechanical feedback ( A CWI = 0 ) , an initially polarized cell with 288 high concentration of Cdc42 at the tip of the mating projection cannot maintain 289 polarization at the tip ( Fig . 3b - c ) . This polarization model can spontaneously break the 290 symmetry and generate a polarization cap ( Fig . 3b ) , as many other models of molecular 291 cell polarization do in spherical geometries [ 21 , 23 – 29 ] . However , as we have shown 292 previously for various polarization models [ 30 ] , the polarization cap moves away from 293 May 15 , 2020 9 / 18 the tip of the mating projection ( Fig . 3b - c ) . 294 To study the effect of the mechanical feedback , we progressively increase its strength 295 A CWI . For values of the mechanical feedback strength above a critical value , we 296 observed that the polarization cap is maintained at the tip of the projection ( Fig . 3e - f ) . 297 While the shape of the cell is fixed ( static ) in these simulations , the values of the 298 mechanical fields and , in particular , the cell wall expansion rate ˙ (cid:15) s + ˙ (cid:15) φ , are those of the 299 growing cell . Essentially , the molecular events associated with cell polarization are able 300 to see a snapshot of the growing cell in these simulations . Since the cell wall expansion 301 rate is localized at the tip of the mating projection [ 31 ] ( Fig . 2d ) , the polarization 302 machinery has a preferential location for actin cable assembly , bringing more Cdc42 to 303 the tip and stabilizing the localization of the polarization cap in this region . These 304 simulations show that the presence of the mechanical feedback on Bni1 activation , 305 which is part of the CWI pathway , can maintain the polarization cap at the tip of the 306 mating projection . 307 While the existence of a mechanical feedback can stabilize the polarization cap at 308 the tip of a static mating projection ( fixed geometry ) , it is unclear whether the 309 polarization cap can also be maintained at the tip during mating projection growth . To 310 address this point , we coupled the 3D stochastic simulations of cell polarization to the 311 mechanics of the expanding cell wall . This involves performing the 3D stochastic 312 simulations of the polarization machinery in a changing cell shape . To do so , we used an 313 operator splitting methodology similar to that described in previous works [ 54 ] , where 314 the simulation domain can evolve over time in a predetermined manner ( Methods ) . To 315 specify how the simulation domain ( cell shape ) evolves over time , we used the 316 description above of cell wall mechanics and expansion ( Eqs . 1 - 3 ) , as it governs the 317 dynamics of cell shape changes . The operator splitting methodology takes advantage of 318 the large separation of timescales between the fast molecular processes that polarize the 319 cell and the slow physical cell wall expansion during cell growth . 320 Staring with a spherical geometry ( sphere of radius r = 2 µm ) and random initial 321 distribution for each chemical species ( Fig . 4a ) , we simulate the polarization dynamics 322 for timescales smaller than those leading to any relevant change in cell shape . The cell 323 polarization machinery establishes a polarization cap within the spherical geometry 324 ( Fig . 4a ) , as observed experimentally [ 24 ] and recapitulated by many polarization 325 models [ 21 , 23 – 29 ] . This spontaneous symmetry breaking reduces the symmetry of the 326 problem from a sphere to an axisymmetric geometry . Taking advantage of the 327 axisymmetric geometry , we time and rotationally averaged the concentration of active 328 Cdc42 and actin cables to obtain their distributions along the arclength s from the tip 329 of the mating projection ( Fig . 4b and Fig . 1f ) . Once these averaged distributions are 330 known ( Fig . 4b ) , they were used as input fields for the equations describing the 331 mechanics of cell wall expansion . As described above in the coarse - grained description , 332 we write the rate of new cell wall assembly G ( s , t ) to be proportional to the local 333 concentration of actin cables , namely G ( s , t ) = k s ρ A , and the cell wall viscosity 334 µ ( s , t ) = µ 0 exp ( s 2 / λ 2A ) , with λ A being the length scale of the decay in actin cable 335 density from the tip of the mating projection . In this specific simulations , the spatial 336 profile of actin cable density ρ A ( s ) corresponds to the averaged distribution of actin on 337 the membrane ( Fig . 4b ) , and λ A is the decay lengthscale obtained from the actin cable 338 density profile ( Fig . 4b ) . Knowing G ( s ) and µ ( s ) from the averaged actin cable density 339 profile , we integrate the Eqs . 1 - 3 describing cell wall expansion from the initial spherical 340 geometry and for a single simulation timestep . Since cell wall expansion is much slower 341 than the molecular polarization dynamics , only a small ( infinitesimal ) cell shape change 342 occurs . We then continue the 3D stochastic simulations of polarization in this new cell 343 geometry ( Methods ) , leading to small changes in the spatial profile of Cdc42 and actin 344 cables . The new averaged spatial profile of actin cable density is then used to obtain the 345 May 15 , 2020 10 / 18 Fig 4 . Coupled dynamics of cell polarization and cell wall expansion during mating projection growth in the presence of mechanical feedback . a , Time evolution of the 3D cell shape and Cdc42 distribution on the cell surface for a single realization of the stochastic simulation . Starting from a uniform density of Cdc42 ( green ) in a spherical geometry , the cell polarizes and grows a mating projection , maintaining the polarization cap at the tip of the growing mating projection . b , Time evolution of the averaged surface Cdc42 ( green ) and actin cable ( red ) densities along the cell arclength the spontaneous polarization of the cell from a depolarized state ( uniform Cdc42 concentration ) and the maintenance of cell polarization at the tip of the mating projection during growth , as indicated by the maximal values of Cdc42 and actin cables densities at the tip . These profiles correspond to averages over 100 realizations . new G ( s ) and µ ( s ) and we solve again the mechanics of cell wall expansion . Iteration of 346 this process allows us to simulate the stochastic dynamics of polarization in the evolving 347 cell shape . 348 To understand whether the mechanical feedback encoded in the CWI pathway could 349 also stabilize the polarization cap during mating projection growth , we simulated their 350 coupled dynamics as described above . For values of the mechanical feedback strength 351 similar to those that stabilized the polarization cap in a fixed geometry , the polarization 352 cap is maintained stable at the tip of the mating projection during growth ( Fig . 4a ) . 353 The profiles of both Cdc42 and actin cables are polarized at the tip ( Fig . 4b ) , displaying 354 a higher concentration in this region and decaying away from it . In the absence of 355 mechanical feedback , no mating projection grows from the initial spherical cell because 356 it is not possible to maintain the polarization cap stably located at the point where the 357 mating projection starts to form . While the averaged profiles of both Cdc42 and actin 358 cable density show very clear polarization at the projection tip ( Fig . 4b ) , snapshots of a 359 single simulation show more fluctuating profiles ( Fig . 4a ) , as expected from stochastic 360 simulations . 361 Discussion 362 We theoretically explored how a mechanical feedback between the mechanics of cell wall 363 expansion and the dynamics of the polarization machinery can stabilize and maintain 364 cell polarization at the tip of a growing mating projection . Using both a coarse - grained 365 description and full 3D stochastic simulations of polarization , our results show that a 366 mechanical feedback encoded in the CWI pathway , which activates the formin Bni1 367 May 15 , 2020 11 / 18 through mechanical input from the cell wall , can maintain the polarization cap at the tip 368 of a growing mating projection . Our description indicates that such genetically - encoded 369 mechanical feedback can provide important positional information to the molecular 370 machinery in the cell , enabling the coordination of cell polarization and morphogenesis . 371 The minimal coarse - grained description showed the existence of a threshold in 372 feedback strength , above which a stable polarization cap can be maintained at the tip . 373 This result is similar to that obtained using 3D stochastic simulations coupled to the 374 mechanics of mating projection growth . However , while the stochastic simulations are 375 able to reproduce both the spontaneous symmetry breaking ( spontaneous polarization 376 of the cell ) in the spherical geometry and also the maintenance of the polarization cap 377 at the tip of the growing mating projection , the minimal coarse - grained description is 378 unable to reproduce the spontaneous formation of a polarization cap . In the minimal 379 description , even in the absence of a preformed polarization cap , the mechanical 380 feedback can generate stably polarized solutions with a polarization cap at the tip . This 381 is because cell polarization is established by the same feedback mechanism that 382 maintains it at the tip . In contrast , the stochastic simulations show that the formation 383 of the polarization cap is independent from the maintenance of the polarization cap at 384 the tip of the projection . Despite these differences , both descriptions indicate that the 385 mechanical feedback can maintain the polarization cap at the tip of a growing mating 386 projection . 387 Previous models of cell polarization in budding yeast have focused solely on spherical 388 geometries [ 23 – 27 ] . As the cell changes shape during mating projection growth , it is 389 essential for the polarization cap to receive some positional information on the location 390 of the growing tip or , alternatively , information about cell shape . Modeling the 391 dynamics of cell polarization without any coupling to variables able to provide positional 392 or geometrical information , as previously done , can properly reproduce the spontaneous 393 symmetry breaking [ 24 ] ( Fig 5a ) , but not the coordination between the polarization cap 394 and cell shape ( Fig 5b ) . While curvature - sensing proteins could potentially localize at 395 the tip of mating projections and provide a scaffold to maintain polarity at the growing 396 tip [ 55 ] , no curvature - sensing proteins have been found in mating projections yet . In 397 budding yeast , curvature sensing proteins are involved in the fusion of mating 398 projections [ 56 ] , but these have a preference for zero curvature surfaces and control 399 proper cell fusion . The formation of actin cables could also help restrict the motion of 400 the polarity cap on the cell surface , as previously suggested for a spherical cell [ 27 ] , but 401 it does not provide a clear feedback to maintain the polarity at specific locations on the 402 cell surface . Cell - sized actin cables could have their configurations restricted by cell 403 shape , leading to an effective coupling between cell geometry and polarity . However , 404 such a coupling would not provide information on the state of the cell wall , which is 405 very important for cell shape changes . Our description provides a mechanism to explain 406 the maintenance of cell polarization at specific locations of the cell surface as the cell 407 changes shape . We propose that the genetically - encoded mechanical feedback through 408 the CWI pathway informs the polarization machinery of the location of the cell surface 409 where the cell wall is expanding , thereby providing the necessary positional information 410 to maintain polarity at the growing mating projection tip ( Fig 5b ) . 411 Beyond budding yeast , many other organisms , including other fungi , plants and 412 bacteria , undergo polarized cell wall growth [ 57 – 60 ] . The molecular control of cell wall 413 remodeling and morphogenesis differs across species [ 61 ] , and it is therefore possible 414 that different mechanisms coordinate cell polarity and morphogenesis in other species . 415 However , the mechanical feedback described herein for mating projection growth in 416 budding yeast may also be present in closely related species , especially fungi like fission 417 yeast [ 62 , 63 ] . Indeed , fission yeast exhibits polarized growth and it has been recently 418 shown that stable polarization caps are destabilized by the arrest of growth [ 12 ] , 419 May 15 , 2020 12 / 18 Fig 5 . Coordination of cell polarization and mating projection growth via mechanical feedback . a , Unpolarized , spherical budding yeast cells can spontaneously break the symmetry and establish a polarization cap that is randomly located on the cell’s surface ( all locations on the cell surface are equally probable ) or even create multiple polarization caps . b , In the absence of any feedback between cell shape / mechanics and cell polarity , the polarity cap lacks positional information and cannot be maintained at the tip . In the presence of the mechanical feedback provided by the CWI pathway ( see details of the feedback events in the box ) , the polarization cap is maintained at the tip of the growing mating projection . In this case , the polarization cap receives positional information through the mechanical feedback in the CWI pathway , which differentiates different positions on the cell surface associated with different levels of cell wall expansion . suggesting the existence of a similar mechanical feedback . Given that in animal cells the 420 actin cortex plays a similar role to the cell wall in walled cells , it is possible that a 421 mechanical feedback between cortex expansion and polarity coordinates the molecular 422 machinery with cell shape , thereby providing important positional information to 423 intracellular processes . In early C . elegans development , there is a direct physical 424 coupling between actin flows and the polarization machinery [ 11 , 64 – 67 ] , but it is 425 unclear if a genetically - encoded mechanical feedback exists . Finally , membrane tension 426 has been suggested to globally coordinate intracellular processes . Specifically , 427 membrane - tension gradients , which may strongly depend on the actin cortex dynamics 428 ( both in animal [ 1 , 8 – 10 ] and walled cells [ 68 ] ) , could potentially provide similar 429 mechanical feedback mechanisms to the one proposed herein . 430 We previously showed that the CWI pathway encoded a mechanical feedback that 431 stabilized budding yeast mating projection growth through the coupling of cell wall 432 expansion and assembly [ 31 ] . The same feedback mechanism was later found in fission 433 yeast [ 62 ] , suggesting that similar mechanical feedback control mechanisms may exist in 434 multiple species . Altogether , our previous results [ 31 ] and those presented here suggest 435 that the same mechanical feedback mechanism , encoded in the CWI pathway , informs 436 the intracellular molecular machinery of cell shape changes , thereby maintaining 437 polarization at the tip of the mating projection while simultaneously ensuring its 438 sustained and robust growth . Since the CWI pathway also couples cell wall mechanics 439 to other intracellular processes ( like exocytosis , etc . ) through Rho1 , it is possible that 440 this mechanical feedback simultaneously coordinates many intracellular processes with 441 cell morphogenesis . 442 May 15 , 2020 13 / 18 The need to coordinate molecular processes with cell shape changes and growth is a 443 general problem beyond polarization . Identifying the molecular mechanisms enabling 444 this coordination at different scales and in different organisms will substantially 445 contribute to our understanding of cell dynamics . 446 Supporting Information 447 S1 File .
