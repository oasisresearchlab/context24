Jones , and Yolanda Calle Supplemental Experimental Procedures Mice WIP 2 / 2 mice from SV129 / C57 / BL6 mouse strain and SV129 / C57 / BL6control ( wild - type ) micewerebredinthefacilitiesofUniversidad Autonoma de Madrid , Spain , as described [ S1 ] . These mice were housed till 6 – 8 weeks old in the pathogen - free animal facility . WASP 2 / 2 mice on a SV129 background [ S2 ] originally obtained from Dr . Fred Alt ( Center for Blood Research , Harvard Medical School , Boston , MA ) were bred in our colony in pathogen - free conditions . Cell Culture Individualspleensremovedfrom6 - to8 - week - oldmiceaftercervical dislocation were homogenized under sterile condition on ice by me - chanical grinding with a syringe plunger through a 40 m m cell strainer . Cells were washed twice in PBS and then resuspended in RPMI supplemented with 10 % FBS , 1 mM pyruvate ( Sigma , UK ) , 1 3 nonessential aminoacids ( Sigma ) , 2 mM glutamine ( Sigma ) , 50 m m 2 - ME ( GIBCO - BRL , UK ) , 20 ng / ml recombinant mouse GM - CSF ( R & D Systems , UK ) , and 1 ng / ml recombinant human TGF - b ( R & D Systems ) and plated at a density of 2 3 10 6 cells / ml in 75 cm 2 culture ﬂasks at 37 (cid:2) C in a 5 % CO 2 atmosphere . After 5 days of culture , 5 ml of fresh medium were added per ﬂask , and at day 8 , the cells in suspension were collected and kept in suspen - sion in fresh medium . After a total of 17 – 18 days ex vivo , 80 % – 90 % of the cells in culture were DCs as determined by the expression of CD11c by FACS analysis ( data not shown ) . Cell viability prior to ex - perimental assays was tested by Trypan blue exclusion . Antibodies and Reagents Antibodies were diluted in PBS containing 2 . 5 % BSA as follows .

Calpain inhibition studieswereperformedwithcalpaininhibitorI ( ALLN ) , calpaininhib - itor II ( ALLM ) , and the cell - permeable calpastatin peptide , all pur - chased from Calbiochem , UK . As negative control for the effect of the calpastatin peptide , we used the scrambled version of the pep - tide from Calbiochem . Inhibition of cathepsins and the proteasome was achieved by treatment of DCs with cathepsin inhibitor 1 and proteasome inhibitor 1 ( PSI ) , both purchased from Calbiochem . Immunoﬂuorescence Microscopy Freshly prepared 10 m g / ml poly - L - lysine ( PLL , Sigma ) , 10 m g / ml hu - man ﬁbronectin ( FN , Sigma ) or 10 m g / ml intercellular cell adhesion molecule - 1 ( ICAM - 1 , R & D Systems ) solutions were incubated over sterile and acid - washed glass coverslips for 1 hr at room tempera - ture before plating cells . 10 5 DCs plated on substratum - coated cov - erslips were ﬁxed with 4 % PFA / 3 % sucrose for 25 min and permea - bilized with 0 . 05 % Triton - X - 100 / PBS for 10 min . Localization of proteins was achieved by means of an appropriate concentration of antibody diluted in 2 . 5 % BSA / PBS at room temperature for 1 hr . After three PBS washes , samples were incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies diluted in 2 . 5 % BSA / PBS . For localization of ﬁlamentous actin , cells were incubated with 0 . 1 m g / ml Alexa 568 - phalloidin ( Sigma ) for 45 min at 37 (cid:2) C . Coverslips were then washed three times with PBS and twice with distilled H 2 0 before being mounted in Vectashield mounting medium ( Vector Laboratories , UK ) . Confocal images were obtained with a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta confocal laser scanning head attached to a Zeiss META Axioplan 2microscope . LSM510softwarewasusedtocollect four sequential imagesfromfourseparateopticalsectionsinthezaxis0 . 2 m mapart . The same software was used to obtain merged confocal projections along the z axis via maxima ﬂuorescence values . Images were ex - ported from Database Files . mdb to TIFF ﬁles by Zeiss LSM Image Browser and processed with Adobe Photoshop 7 . 0 software . Fluorescent Activated Cell Sorting To prepare samples for FACS analysis , a minimum of 2 3 10 5 cells per FACS tube were ﬁxed with 4 % paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) / 3 % su - crose for 20 min . After two washes in PBS by centrifugation ( 1500 rpm for 5 min ) , the suspension was incubated in 50 m l of 5 % BSA blocking solution to reduce nonspeciﬁc binding . The cell sam - ples were centrifuged and resuspended with appropriate amounts of each individual antibody solutions and incubated for 1 hr at room temperature . After three washes with PBS , cells were incu - bated in a dilution of 1 : 100 of the corresponding ﬂuorescently tagged secondary antibody followed by three washings in PBS Figure S2 . WIP Is Required for the Normal Clustering of b 2 - Integrins and Integrin - Associated Proteins in DCs DCs plated on PLL - coated glass coverslips were ﬁxed with 4 % paraformaldehyde / 3 % sucrose , permeabilized with 0 . 05 % Triton X - 100 , and immunostained to determine the distribution of the corresponding proteins .

Controls included cells alone as auto - ﬂuorescence control , and cells incubated with FITC - conjugated secondary antibodies were used as negative controls for these ex - periments . The percentage of positive cells was obtained by setting the percentage of negative controls as 2 % – 5 % . In all experiments , 10 , 000 cells were analyzed . FACS analysis was performed via FACS Calibur with CellQuest software ( Becton Dickinson , San Jose , CA ) . Allanalyseswerecarriedoutaminimumofthreeindepen - dent occasions . Analysis of Adhesion Turnover We used interference reﬂection microscopy ( IRM ) [ S3 , S4 ] to visual - ize the adhesion - substratum interface of living cells . DCs in com - plete culture medium were plated on the glass coverslips previously coated with the relevant substratum . Coverslips were mounted and sealed onto viewing chambers in culture medium and held at 37 (cid:2) C . Interference reﬂection images were collected with a Zeiss Standard 18 microscope with an incident light ﬂuorescence attachment . Ex - citer and barrier ﬁlters were removed from the LP420 reﬂector and replaced with a narrow band pass ﬁlter to isolate the 546 nm line of the mercury arc source . Coverslips with attached cells were ob - served with a Zeiss 63 3 Neoﬂuar Antiﬂex oil immersion objective , NA 1 . 25 . Images were recorded digitally with in - house software and replayed as a movie . Alternatively , podosome turnover in DCs expressing eGFP constructs ( see below ) was performed by simulta - neously visualizing GFP signal and adhesion - substratum interface with a Zeiss LSM META confocal scanning head as described above , and with the 488 nm line of an Argon laser and a 470 – 500 nm band pass ﬁlter to detect the interference reﬂection signal and a 505 nm long pass ﬁlter to detect the eGFP signal . The resulting multi - image TIFF ﬁles were processed with customized Adobe Pho - toshop version 7 . 0 to threshold as well as to increase contrast and sharpness of the adhesion points of the cells with the substratum . To analyze the persistence of adhesion points , 10 images taken 30sapartwereoverlappedviathedifferencefunctioninAdobePho - toshop . Eachimagewasthresholdedtoproduceblackadhesionson white background and then inverted as white adhesions on black background . Next , the image was divided by 10 to obtain dark gray corresponding to adhesions ( i . e . , 256 / 10 on the scale of 1 – 256 ) . The 10 images were then overlapped and reinverted . Finally , a composite image with 10 relevant gray levels was obtained . The lightest gray level represented pixels that were present in one of the ten images ( adhesion points last for 30 s ) , and the darkest gray level represented pixels that were present in 10 out of 10 images ( i . e . , adhesion points last for 300 s ) . Therefore , the areas of light gray color pixels represent dynamic adhesions whereas areas of dark gray and black color pixels represent stable adhesions over the selected interval of time . With the histogram function of Adobe Photoshop , we could quantify the percentage of pixels per image corresponding to each gray level , which allowed us to calculate the turnover index by dividing the percentage of pixels present in 9 and 10 of the gray scale map by the percentage present in 1 and 2 of the gray scale map . Turnover index = ( % of pixels present in gray level 9 + 10 ) / ( % of pixels present in gray level 1 + 2 ) . Thus , a ratio of unstable adhesion over stable adhesion in each live cell was FigureS3 . QuantitativeAnalysisof b 1 - and b 2 - IntegrinExpressionin DC by FACS 2 3 10 5 DCs were harvested and incubated with b 1 or b 2 antibodies followed by the appropriate secondary FITC - labeled antibody . Graphs illustrate the distribution of the expression of b 1 ( A ) and b 2 ( B ) integrins in DCs . Shaded histograms represent cells stained with secondary antibody alone , as negative control ; full line and dotted line histograms represent the staining of wild - type DCs and WIP 2 / 2 DCs , respectively . The histograms show the results of one experiment representative out of three . Figure S4 . Comparison of Expression of WIP - Binding Partners between Wild - Type and WIP 2 / 2 DCs ( A ) Total lysates of wild - type ( WT ) and WIP 2 / 2 DCs were resolved by 12 % SDS - PAGE , western blotted , and probed with cortactin , Nck , CrkL or tubulin antibodies after stripping according to the experiment . Tubulin showed the loading control in each lane . ( B ) Graphshowsthequantiﬁcation oftheexpressionofrelativeamountsoftheproteinsdetectedbyimmunoblotasshownin ( A ) . Theintensityof luminosity ( I . L . ) and the area of each band in an inverted image was calculated with the histogram function of Photoshop 7 . 0 and the value of relative amount of protein ( AU ) was calculated as follows : I . L . 3 Area ( protein to be tested ) / I . L . 3 Area ( tubulin ) . No signiﬁcant differences were detected in expression of cortactin , Nck , and CrkL between wild - type and WIP 2 / 2 DCs . Of note , in cortactin immunoblots we detected an increase in a band of approximately 70 kDa ( asterisk ) likely to be a calpain - mediated cleavage product previously described [ S8 ] . S3 obtained . Thehighervalueoftheturnoverindexrepresentsthemore dynamic of the cell adhesion . Unpaired Student’s t test was used to assess the signiﬁcance of experimental results . Kymography IRM image stacks were imported into Mathematica 5 . 2 where they were processed to normalize image contrast . Two intensity line - scans were then taken for each image in the stack : one was along thelargestaxisofspreadDCs , whichdisplayanelongatedmorphol - ogy ( in the case of wild - type DCs , this axis corresponds with the di - rection of cell movement ) , the other perpendicular to this and cen - tered on a region just behind one end of the axis . Line - scans from each image in the stack were then used to construct kymographs . 1 - dimensional line - scans were then converted into a 2 - dimensional arrayforeachimagestack . Theresultantarraywasthenrepresented as a kymograph with time on the y axis of the image and distance alongtheintensityproﬁle onthe xaxis . Theﬁrst kymographenabled visualization of protrusiveevents inthe direction ofmotion , whereas the second kymograph enabled visualization of protrusive events perpendicular to this . Thus , data , such as the rate of protrusion at the leading edge and the number , extent , and frequency of protru - sions at the sides of the cell could be determined . Western Blot Cell lysates from either untreated or protease inhibitor - treated DCs were obtained by adding Laemmli sample buffer to plated cells . Ap - proximately 20 m g of total cell lysate protein was loaded per lane in a 12 % SDS - PAGE gel and subjected to electrophoresis . Proteins were blotted onto PVDF membranes with a Bio - Rad Mini protein II transfer apparatus . Blots were blocked with 5 % dried milk / TBS - T for 1 hr at room temperature , incubated with indicated antibodies at 4 (cid:2) C overnight . After three washes with TBS - T , immunoprobed proteins were detected by incubation with horseradish peroxi - dase - conjugated secondary antibodies at room temperature for 1hr . AfterfurtherwashesinTBS - T , immunoprobedproteinswerevi - sualized by ECL chemiluminescence kit ( Amersham , UK ) , exposed on Hyperﬁlm ECL ( Amersham , UK ) , and developed with an Imaging Systems Xograph compact X4 developer . Blots were reprobed after treating with stripping buffer at 50 (cid:2) C for 30 min three times . RT - PCR Total RNA from 2 3 10 6 WT DCs and WIP 2 / 2 DCs for RT - PCR was prepared with GenElute Mammalian Total RNA kit ( Sigma ) , and En - hancedAvianHSRT - PCRkit ( Sigma ) wasusedtosubsequentlyam - plify the resulting cDNA . To avoid the possible contamination of DNA , DNase digestion ( Ampliﬁcationn Grade DNase 1 , Sigma ) was further performed prior to RT - PCR . The speciﬁc oligonucleotide primers designed based on the WASP nucleotide sequence were : forward primer , 5 0 - GAT GTG AAC AAC CTA GAC CC - 3 0 ; reverse primer , 5 0 - GCA CCC CCC ATA GGT ACA GG - 3 0 . b - actin was used as a control reaction and the primers were : forward primer , 5 0 - TGC GTG ACA TTA AGG AGA AG - 3 0 ; reverse primer , 5 0 - CTG CAT CCT GTC GGC AAT G - 3 0 . One - Step RT - PCR Reaction was selected as the PCR condition ( 35 cycles , annealing 55 (cid:2) C ) according to manu - facturer’s instructions . The PCR products were analyzed by running on a 1 % agarose gel and subsequent ethidium bromide staining . Infections of DCs with Lentiviral Vectors Lentiviral vector stocks were produced in 293T cells by cotransfect - ing the transfer vector pHR’SINcPPT - SFFV - eGFP - ( SEW ) or SFFV - eGFP - WASP ( SEWW ) , the envelope plasmid pMD . G , and the pack - aging plasmid pCMVR8 . 91 , as previously described [ S5 ] . 1 . 5 3 10 7 cells were seeded onto 150 cm 2 ﬂasks and transfected with 10 m g DNAenvelope , 30 m gDNApackaging , and40 m gDNAtransfervector byprecomplexingwith0 . 125 m MPEI ( 22kDa ) for15minatroomtem - perature in Optimem . After 4 hr at 37 (cid:2) C , the medium was replaced with fresh DMEM 10 % FCS and virus were harvested 48 and 72 hr posttransfection . Afterﬁlteringthrougha0 . 45 m m - pore - sizeﬁlter , the virus suspension was concentrated by centrifugation at 50 , 000 3 g for2hrat4 (cid:2) C . TheresultingpelletwasresuspendedinRPMI ( Sigma ) and stored at 2 80 (cid:2) C until use . The desired number of DCs were plated in complete culture medium as described above with phe - nol - free RPMI ( Sigma ) and lentivirus containing supernatant was added to the cells at an MOI of 100 and incubated for 24 hr . Media was replaced for complete DC culture medium without phenol - free RPMI after 24 hr , and cells were cultured for another 48 hr to allow maximal expression of lentiviral vectors before being used in exper - iments . Generation of Mutant WASP Expression Constructs Human wild - type ( WT ) WASP was cloned from the FL3 plasmid ( gift from J . Derry ) into the pEGFP - C1 ( Invitrogen ) cloning vector , and A134T and R138P point mutations were introduced via the Quik - change protocol ( Qiagen ) . The VCA domain - deleted WASP contruct ( d VCA ) was generated by PCR with a reverse primer starting at nu - cleotide 1288 of the WASP gene , and cloned into pEGFP - C1 . WT and mutated WASP were then subcloned into the EF - Bos - GST ex - pression vector , containing GST ampliﬁed by PCR from the pGEX - 2T vector . Mutant and WT WASP in the EF - Bos - GST vector were then sequenced to conﬁrm the presence or absence of point muta - tions or truncation . Cell Transfection and Recombinant Protein Production COS - 7cells ( 7 3 10 6 ) wereelectroporatedwith20 m gofplasmidDNA in 400 m l of special electroporation buffer ( 120 mM KCl , 10 mM K 2 PO 4 / KH 2 PO 4 [ pH 7 . 6 ] , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 25 mM HEPES [ pH 7 . 6 ] , 0 . 5 % Ficoll 400 ) by a Biorad Genepulser II at 250V and 975 m F . After overnight growth , cells were harvested in ice - cold lysis buffer ( 1 % Nonidet P40 , 130 mM NaCl , 20 mM Tris - HCl [ pH 8 . 0 ] , 10 mM NaF , 2 mM sodium orthovanadate , 1 % aprotinin , 10 m g / ml leupeptin , 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride , 2 mM EDTA , Cytochalasin D 2 m M , Latrunculin B 2 m M ) , and lysates were clariﬁed by centrifuga - tion at 15 , 000 3 g for 10 min . Actin Polymerization Assay The bead - based actin polymerisation assay was modiﬁed from an assay previously described [ S6 , S7 ] . COS - 7 cell lysates ( transfected with WT or mutant GST expression vectorsorGST alone ) were incu - bated with 75 m L of glutathione sepharose 4B beads ( Amersham Biosciences ) for 2 hr at 4 (cid:2) C . Beads were then washed with lysis buffer ( 3 3 ) , 0 . 5 M LiCl , 20 mM Tris ( pH 8 . 0 ) ( 3 2 ) , 20 mM Tris ( pH 8 . 0 ) ( 3 1 ) and stored in 75 % glycerol , 10 mM TRIS ( pH 8 . 0 ) , 1 mM EDTA at 2 20 (cid:2) C . U937 cell lysates were prepared by lysing 1 3 10 7 cells in 1 ml of actin polymerization buffer ( 1 % Nonidet P40 , 130 mM NaCl , 20 mM Tris - HCl [ pH 7 . 4 ] , 1 % aprotinin , 10 m g / ml leu - peptin , 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride , 1 mM EDTA ) , and then clarifying as above . This lysate was then supplemented with 5 mM MgCl 2 , and 1 mM ATP . 250 m l of lysate was then incubated with 8 m l of GST - WASP - coated sepharose beads on a rotor for 1 hr at room temperature . A negative control was performed with 2 m M cy - tochalasin D added to the lysate to inhibit actin polymerization . The beads were then washed with actin polymerization buffer ( 3 2 ) prior to pelleting and mixing with NuPAGE LDS Sample Buffer and reduc - ing agent ( Invitrogen ) and heating to 70 (cid:2) C for 10 min . Samples were resolved by electrophoresis with 4 % – 12 % Nupage Bis - Tris gel and MOPS buffer ( Invitrogen ) . Blots were stained with B - 14 : sc - 138 monoclonal mouse GST mAb ( Santa Cruz Biotech ) ( > 65 KDa and < 35 KDa ) or rabbit anti - actin afﬁnity isolated antibody ( Sigma A2066 ) ( 35 – 65 KDa ) . HRP - conjugated rabbit anti - mouse and goat anti - rabbit antibodies ( Dako ) were used , respectively , and the ECL Western detection system ( Amersham ) was used for detection .
