During tumor progression , Epithelial cadherin ( E - cadherin ) expression is altered and β - catenin may be translocated to the nucleus , where it acts as co - transcription factor of tumor invasion associated genes . This investigation further characterizes E - cadherin and β - catenin associated changes in BC , by combining bioinformatics , an experimental murine cell model ( MB49 / MB49 - I ) and human BC samples . In in silico studies , a DisGeNET ( gene - disease associations database ) analysis identiﬁed CDH1 ( E - cadherin gene ) as one with highest score among 130 BC related - genes . COSMIC mutation analysis revealed CDH1 low mutations rates . Compared to MB49 control BC cells , MB49 - I invasive cells showed decreased E - cadherin expression , E - to P - cadherin switch , higher β - catenin nuclear signal and lower cytoplasmic p - Ser33 - β - catenin signal , higher Ephrin - B1 ligand and EphB2 receptor expression , higher Phospho - Stat3 and Urokinase - type Plasminogen Activator ( UPA ) , and UPA receptor expression . MB49 - I cells transfected with Ephrin - B1 siRNA showed lower migratory and invasive capacity than control cells ( scramble siRNA ) . By immunohistochemistry , orthotopic MB49 - I tumors had lower E - cadherin , increased nuclear β - catenin , lower pSer33 - β - catenin cytoplasmic signal , and higher Ephrin - B1 expression than MB49 tumors . Similar changes were found in human BC tumors , and 83 % of inﬁltrating tumors depicted a high Ephrin - B1 stain . An association between higher Ephrin - B1 expression and higher stage and tumor grade was found . No association was found between abnormal E - cadherin signal , Ephrin - B1 expression or clinical - pathological parameter . This study thoroughly analyzed E - cadherin and associated changes in BC , and reports Ephrin - B1 as a new marker of tumor aggressiveness .

Ephrin - B1 and Bladder Cancer Aggressiveness INTRODUCTION Bladder cancer ( BC ) is one of the ten solid tumors with highest incidence and mortality worldwide , with 549 , 393 new cases and 199 , 922 deaths reported in 2018 , and with an increase of 50 % expected for 2040 ( International Agency for Research on Cancer ; WHO 1 ) . Clinically , it is classiﬁed as non - muscle - invasive ( NMIBC ) and muscle - invasive ( MIBC ) or inﬁltrating BC , being the latter highly aggressive . Urothelial tumors represent > 90 % of the cases ; while 75 % are limited to the mucosa or submucosa at the time of diagnosis , 10 – 30 % NMIBC patients progress to MIBC and 50 – 70 % have tumor recurrence ( 1 ) . Thus , muscle invasion is a key event in BC , being important to identify MIBC biomarkers for accurate treatment and understanding the underlying mechanisms to prevent tumor progression and aggressiveness . Among molecular changes associated to BC , a decreased expression of epithelial cadherin ( E - cadherin ) has long been reported ( 2 ) . In a systematic review and meta - analysis , reduced E - cadherin was associated with poor BC prognosis ( 3 ) ; however , the underlying mechanisms have not been fully characterized . E - cadherin is the founder member of the cadherin superfamily ( 4 ) . It is a 120 kDa transmembrane glycoprotein encoded by the CDH1 gene ; its extracellular domain mediates cell - cell adhesion , while the cytoplasmic domain binds to β - catenin that links E - cadherin to the actin cytoskeleton , and is involved in signal transduction ( 5 ) . E - cadherin decrease / loss expression is a hallmark of Epithelial - to - Mesenchymal Transition ( EMT ) that promotes cell motility / invasive behavior , cancer progression and metastasis ( 6 , 7 ) . Alterations in E - cadherin expression during EMT are accompanied by increased expression of transcriptional represors , β - catenin loss at the cell membrane , and ﬁlamentous actin ( F - actin ) belt replacement by a network of stress ﬁbers . Also , it is tipically characterized by an increased expression of neural ( N - cadherin ) and , in some cases , by placental ( P - cadherin ) cadherin , a phenomenon called cadherin switch . Some evidence of EMT - related events has been reported in BC ( 8 – 10 ) . This report further characterizes alterations in E - cadherin expression and EMT - related events in BC with the aim to identify novel markers of BC progression . Studies were addressed in the MB49 and MB49 - I murine model of tumor progression ( 11 , 12 ) , and in BC patient tissue samples . MATERIALS Chemicals were of analytical and tissue culture grade and purchased from BioRad ( Richmond , CA , USA ) , Thermo - Fisher Scientiﬁc ( Carlsbad , CA , USA ) , and Sigma Chemical Co . ( St . Louis , MO , USA ) , unless speciﬁcally indicated . Primary antibodies used were : Anti - E - cadherin : ( 1 ) 610181 ( BD 1 InternationalAgencyforResearchonCancer ; WorldHealthOrganization . http : / / globocan . iarc . fr . Biosciences , San Diego , CA , USA ) , ( 2 ) HECD - 1 ( Thermo ) ; Anti - β - catenin ( 610153 ; BD ) ; Anti - phospho - Ser33 - β - catenin ( pSer33 - β - catenin ; Ser33 - R ; SCB ) ; Anti - N - cadherin ( H - 63 , SCB ) ; Anti - P - cadherin ( H - 105 , SCB ) ; Anti - Ephrin - B1 ( A - 20 , SCB ) ; Anti - EphB2 ( H - 80 , SCB ) ; Anti - Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 ( STAT3 ) ( B - 7 , SCB ) ; Anti - phospho - STAT3 ( pSTAT3 ) ( C - 20 , SCB ) ; Anti - Proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( PCNA ) ( PC10 , SCB ) , Anti - actin ( I - 19 , SCB ) ; Anti - β - tubulin ( D - 66 , Sigma ) . Secondary antibodies used were Cy3 - labeled anti - mouse or anti - rabbit ( Sigma ) and FITC - labeled anti - mouse ( Vector Lab . Inc . , Burlingame , CA , USA ) IgGs for ﬂuorescence immunocytochemistry , Anti - mouse ( Vector ) or Anti - rabbit ( Sigma ) IgGs coupled to horseradish peroxidase for Western immunoblotting . In control experiments , primary antibodies were replaced by puriﬁed mouse or rabbit IgGs , as required . Murine Cell Lines and Tumors Established MB49 and MB49 - I mouse cell lines were used as experimental models . The MB49 cell line was generated from an in vitro neoplastic transformation of mouse bladder epithelium primary cultures ( 13 ) . The MB49 - I cell line was originated after in vivo successive passages of a primary tumor obtained by subcutaneous inoculation of MB49 cells in C57Bl / 6J males ( 11 ) . Murine bladder tumors were generated by orthotopic inoculation of MB49 and MB49 - I cells into C57BL / 6 mice bladder ( 11 ) . Mice were handled in accordance with the international procedure for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals ; a protocol was approved by the Institute of Oncology Angel H . Roﬀo Review Board ( # 2012 / 02 ) . Human Tumor Samples Human BC tissue samples were obtained from patients diagnosed with urothelial BC at Hospital Italiano of Buenos Aires , between 2012 and 2016 . The project was approved by Ethics Committees of Hospital Italiano and IBYME ( Protocol # C004 - 1 / 2012 ) ; patients signed a written informed consent . Ten fresh biopsies ( non - tumor and tumor sections , 1 cm 3 each ) from patients diagnosed with inﬁltrating BC were collected from the surgical piece , placed in RNA Later R (cid:13) and subjected to RNA extraction and subsequent quantitative real - time PCR analysis . In addition , 38 paraﬃn - embedded tissue samples from patients diagnosed with BC and subjected to transurethral resection or radical cystectomy , were included in the study and analyzed by immunohistochemistry ; Supplementary Table 1 summarizes available information on patient gender , age , tumor stage and grade , as well as evidence of metastasis . PCR Primers Primers were designed for endpoint ( analytical ) and quantitative real time PCR protocols using Primer - BLAST tool ( http : / / www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov / tools / primer - blast ) ; sequences and expected PCR fragment sizes are listed in Supplementary Table 2 . Some primers were previously reported ( 14 , 15 ) . Frontiers in Oncology | www . frontiersin . org 2 March 2020 | Volume 10 | Article 283 Mencucci et al . Ephrin - B1 and Bladder Cancer Aggressiveness METHODS Bioinformatics To perform text mining on BC gene - disease associations , the DisGeNET discovery platform ( http : / / www . disgenet . org / ) was used . DisGeNET integrates information on human diseases and their genes from expert - curated databases and scientiﬁc literature found by means of text - mining approaches ( 16 ) . Gene - disease associations are ranked according to DisGeNET score , and annotated with DisGeNET gene - disease association type ontology . A set of search terms related to BC was selected to browse all DisGeNET databases and to search for CDH1 among the output list . The DisGeNET version containing 628 , 685 associations between 17 , 549 genes and 24 , 166 diseases was used in the present study ( March , 2019 ) . Listed somatic mutations in the CDH1 ( E - cadherin ) and CTNNB1 ( β - catenin ) genes in BC were retrieved from the COSMIC ( http : / / cancer . sanger . ac . uk / cosmic ) catalog of public domain data tool . COSMIC provides information about mutations aﬀecting tumor - associated genes , and establishes a hierarchy of the 20 most commonly mutated genes in a speciﬁc tumor , as well as number of cases in which a mutation was reported . For each mutation , information is available on position and type of change , as well as amino acid ( s ) involved ; in case of substitutions , it provides information on the speciﬁc change that occurs with the mutation . The COSMIC v88 used in this study includes over 6 million coding mutations across than > 1 . 4 million tumor samples curated from > 26 , 000 publications ( 17 ) . Information was ﬁltered to obtain data from samples of patients diagnosed with transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder , which were 5 , 774 of the total 8 , 359 BC samples ( March , 2019 ) . MB49 and MB49 - I Cell Culture and Orthotopic Tumors MB49 and MB49 - I cell lines were cultured as previously reported ( 11 ) . At 70 – 80 % conﬂuence , cells were harvested and processed for RNA and protein ( Western immunoblotting / immunocytochemistry ) analyses . MB49 and MB49 - I orthotopic tumors were generated as previously described ( 11 ) . Basically , orthotopic cell injection in C57BL / 6 female mice was performed by placing a catheter into the urethra . Previously , focal electrocautery was performed to induce punctual damage to the bladder wall . MB49 and MB49 - I suspensions from subconﬂuent cell culture monolayers were instilled in 100 µ l RPMI 1640 medium . Mice were monitored twice weekly for hematuria and by bladder palpation . Two weeks after tumor cell inoculation , the animals were sacriﬁced and tumors included in paraﬃn for subsequent immunohistochemical analysis . Transient Transfection Assays MB49 - I cells transient transfection was performed using Lipofectamine R (cid:13) 2000 ( Thermo ) and 100 pmol / ml of a speciﬁc small interfering Ephrin - B1 RNA ( siRNA ) ( # 39437 , SCB ; pool of 3 target - speciﬁc 19 – 25 nt siRNAs designed to knock down gene expression ) following a standard procedure ( 18 ) . Control assays with scramble siRNA ( # 37007 , SCB ) were included . RNA Extraction , cDNA Synthesis , Standard , and Quantitative Real Time PCR Cell and tissue total RNA was isolated and processed for complementary DNA ( cDNA ) synthesis ( 14 , 15 , 18 ) . PCR samples were prepared with SYBR Green R (cid:13) PCR Master Mix ( Thermo ) mixture and run in CFX96 Touch TM ( BioRad ) PCR unit . Triplicate samples and negative controls ( no template ) were always included . Dissociation curves were run to conﬁrm signal speciﬁcity . GAPDH was selected as endogenous control and MB49 cells as reference . The calculation describing these relations is 2 − 11 Ct , where 11 Ct = [ 1 Ct test sample – 1 Ct reference sample ] , and 1 Ct = [ Ct gene under study – Ct endogenous gene ] . Alternatively , calculations were done using 2 − 1 Ct method , where 1 Ct = [ Ct gene under study – Ct endogenous gene ] . Primer sequences and expected PCR fragment sizes are listed in Supplementary Table 2 . Protein Extraction and Western Immunoblotting Protocols Protein extraction and analysis was done essentially as previously described ( 14 , 15 , 18 ) . Basically , cell monolayers were incubated with PBS on ice , followed by protein extraction with RIPA ( 20 mM Tris - HCl , pH = 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 % NP - 40 , 1 % sodium deoxycholate , and standard protease inhibitors cocktail ) buﬀer . For Stat3 and phospho - Stat3 detection , buﬀer was supplemented with 1 mM orthovanadate , 10 mM β - glycerol phosphate , and 25 mM sodium ﬂuoride ( phosphatase inhibitors ) . Cells were harvested using a scrapper , and lysis was completed by physical rupture with a 22G needle syringe . Cell lysates were centrifuged at 13 , 000 × g for 30 min , pellets were discarded , and protein content was quantiﬁed using the Bradford method with a commercial reagent ( BioRad ) following manufacturer’s instructions . The NE - PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents ( Pierce Protein Research Products ( Thermo ) commercial kit was used to obtain MB49 and MB49 - I cell cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts . Proteins were separated by electrophoresis in 10 % Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate - PolyAcrylamide Gel Electrophoresis ( SDS - PAGE ) followed by Western immunoblotting . Proteins were immunodetected using standardized protocols and speciﬁc antibodies . Protein bands obtained in development plates ( AGFA , Belgium ) were digitized using a scanner ( Hewlett - Packard , USA ) and , in some cases , the signal density was quantiﬁed with the Image J software ( Wright Cell Imaging Facility ; Toronto , ON , Canada ) , and normalized with loading controls . Fluorescence Immunocytochemical Analysis Cells grown on glass coverslips were ﬁxed and subjected to immunocytochemical analysis ( 14 , 15 , 18 ) . Cell nuclei were stained with 1 µ g / ml Hoechst 33342 or 5 µ g / ml propidium iodide ( BD Pharmigen ) in PBS for 5 min , as speciﬁcally indicated . Negative controls were done placing puriﬁed mouse or rabbit IgG at the same concentration of primary antibody . Presence Frontiers in Oncology | www . frontiersin . org 3 March 2020 | Volume 10 | Article 283 Mencucci et al . Ephrin - B1 and Bladder Cancer Aggressiveness of ﬁlamentous actin ( F - actin ) was detected with AlexaFluor 488 phalloidin ( Thermo ) . Stained cells were observed in a ﬂuorescence microscope ( Nikon - C2 , excitation ﬁlters 488 nm / 544 nm , emission ﬁlters 523 – 530 nm / 570 - lp nm ) ; when required , images were analyzed using the Image J software . Immunohistochemical Analysis Immunohistochemical analysis was performed in paraﬃn - embedded sections from orthotopic tumors of MB49 and MB49 - I cell lines , normal C57BL / 6 mice bladder and human bladder tumors . Five µ m - tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin / eosin for cell morphology analysis or subjected to immunohistochemistry of E - cadherin , β - catenin , pSer33 - β - catenin , and Ephrin - B1 . In negative controls , primary antibody was replaced by IgG added at the same concentration of primary antibodies . Signal was developed with LSAB + System - HRP ( Dako ) colorimetric system . Ephrin - B1 staining was scored by two anatomo - pathologists , according to the percentage of stained cells ( 0 , no stained cells , 1 , 1 to 29 % , 2 , 30 to 69 % , 3 , 70 100 % stained cells ) and the intensity of the signal ( 0 , without staining ; 1 : weak ; 2 : moderate ; 3 : strong ) , and a total score was calculated ( ≥ 3 , “high” Ephrin - B1 ; < 3 “low” Ephrin - B1 ) . E - cadherin staining score was normal ( ≥ 1 – 29 % cells with a membrane signal ) or abnormal ( low or high signal , but without membrane localization ) . Cell Migration and Invasion Assays Cell migration and invasion assays were run in MB49 - I cells transiently transfected with a siRNA toward Ephrin - B1 and Control ( scramble SiRNA ) . The procedure was done basically as previously reported ( 18 ) ( 8 h to assess migration and 40 h to evaluate invasion ) . In the lower part of the device , medium with 10 % FBS was placed to act as chemoattractant . Cells were ﬁxed and stained with 0 . 5 % violet crystal solution in 20 % methanol . Images from six diﬀerent ﬁelds were recorded and cells counted using the Image J software . Statistical Analysis All experiments were run in triplicates . Results are expressed as mean ± SEM . Statistical analysis was done using GraphPad Prism software , version 5 . 01 ( GraphPad Software , USA ) and InfoStat , version 2015 ( InfoStat Group , Argentina ) . For assays involving two groups , the Mann Whitney or Wilcoxon test was performed , as required ; for assays involving > 2 groups , the Kruskal Wallis test followed by multiple decompositions according to Dunn was run . Analysis of Ephrin - B1 and E - cadherin immunohistochemistry results was done using the Pearson Chi - Square test . A P < 0 . 05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant . RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Bioinformatics Survey of BC and E - Cadherin A bioinformatics analysis was done to retrieve a list of BC - associated genes . To perform this analysis , the DisGeNET database was surveyed to identify genes annotated to the terms “Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder , ” “Bladder Neoplasm , ” “Transitional cell carcinoma of bladder , ” “Carcinoma in situ of bladder , ” and “Carcinoma of bladder . ” One hundred and thirty genes were identiﬁed ; CDH1 was among genes with highest score ( CDH1 , CDKN2A , ERCC2 , FGFR3 , GSTP1 , HRAS , NQO1 , TP53 , TSC1 ) , speciﬁcally when only the term “Bladder neoplasm” was surveyed . Figure 1 shows a graphical representation of both networks , and Supplementary Table 3 lists genes retrieved from DisGeNet survey , with their association type and score . In addition , a search of CDH1 somatic mutations in BC was done using the COSMIC bioinformatics tool . As a result , CDH1 mutations were found in 17 / 587 ( 2 . 90 % ) tested BC samples , 15 of which were located in exonic sequences of diﬀerent protein segments [ residues 9 , 27 , 28 , 150 , 159 , 210 , 240 , 248 , 357 , 638 ( twice ) , 641 , 677 , 731 , 785 ] . Table 1 lists the identiﬁed mutations . Altogether , these studies showed evidence of CDH1 / E - cadherin involvement in BC , which was related only in few cases to mutations in the CDH1 gene . Results of these surveys encouraged authors to further investigate changes in E - cadherin and related molecules , and the underlying mechanisms in BC . Expression of E - Cadherin and EMT - Related Markers in MB49 and MB49 - I Murine BC Cell Lines Initial studies were focused on evaluating the expression of E - cadherin and some EMT - related genes in MB49 and MB49 - I in vitro cell cultures ( Figure 2A ) . While in standard RT - PCR assays E - cadherin mRNA was detected in both cell lines , quantitative real - time PCR analyses revealed a 30 % decrease ( P < 0 . 05 ) in E - cadherin transcript levels in MB49 - I cells compared to MB49 parental cells ( Figure 2B ) . In agreement with these ﬁndings , E - cadherin protein analysis by Western immunoblotting revealed signiﬁcant lower expression levels of the 120 KDa full - length adhesion full - length protein form in MB49 - I cells , representing < 10 % of those found in MB49 cells ( Figures 2C , D ) . These ﬁndings are consistent with early studies done in human samples , in which lower E - cadherin levels were found in inﬁltrating than in superﬁcial bladder tumors ( 2 , 19 , 20 ) . In any case , while a 30 % decrease in the CDH1 transcript was found in MB49 - I compared to MB49 cells , a sharp decrease to undetectable protein levels was determined . Diﬀerences observed between both cell lines in E - cadherin transcript and protein levels may relate to expression levels of the adhesion protein present in these cell lines and methodologies used to detect them . Both cell lines depict low E - cadherin mRNA expression levels ( around Ct 36 ) , but the quantitative real time PCR procedure can accurately measure low transcript levels in both cell lines . On the other hand , expression levels of the adhesion protein may be close to the limit of detection , resulting in a very poor / absent signal in MB49 - I cells , even when using sensitive detection systems . Alternatively , diﬀerences between RNA and protein levels in the murine cell lines may result from selective regulatory post - transcriptional , translational and post - translational mechanisms , i . e . , pre - mRNA splicing , polyadenylation , capping , and mRNA transport , turnover , storage , and translation ( 21 ) . Some post - transcriptional mechanisms have been shown to critically inﬂuence EMT ( 22 – 24 ) .

Data retrieved from the COSMIC database ( GRCh38 · COSMIC v90 ) . mRNA turnover by ribonucleoproteins , HuR is one of the best - studied regulators of cytoplasmic mRNA fate ( 21 ) , and evidence supports its interaction with the 3’ - untranslated region of E - cadherin mRNA and regulation of E - cadherin translation ( 25 ) . In BC , HuR appears to regulate the expression of many urinary tumors - associated molecules ( 26 ) , and a signiﬁcant association between positive cytoplasmic HuR signal and high tumor grade , pT stage and micro - vessel density has been reported in BC ( 27 ) . Diﬀerences found between E - cadherin expression levels in both cell lines and between mRNA and protein levels found may be , at least in part , related to the expression of HuR in the murine cell model and modulation of E - cadherin mRNA and protein stability . Mouse cells have been reported to conserve consensus sequences and mechanisms found in humans for these regulations ( 28 ) . In addition to this regulatory mechanism , the translated E - cadherin protein may be subjected to proteolytic cleavage , catalyzed by matrix metalloproteinases ( MMP - 3 , MMP - 7 , MMP - 9 , and MT1 - MMP ) , A - disintegrin - and - metalloproteinases ( ADAM10 and ADAM15 ) , plasmin , and kallikrein 7 , releasing the 86 KDa ectodomain fragment and a 38 KDa fragment associated to the membrane , which is degraded to smaller fragments ( 5 , 29 ) . Since MMP9 has been previously reported in BC ( 30 ) and in the MB49 - I cell model ( 11 ) , part of the lower signal may be the result of E - cadherin processing ; E - cadherin cellular fragments may not be resolved in 10 % SDS - PAGE gels , are below the limit of the detection , or lack the antibody epitope , and are not shown in the proﬁle . Since transcriptional repression is one mechanism associated to decreased E - cadherin ( 5 ) , expression of Snail , Slug , Zeb1 , and Twist transcriptional repressors was analyzed in both cell lines . As shown in Figure 2E , an increased expression ( P < 0 . 05 ) of Snail and Slug transcripts was observed in MB49 - I cells compared to MB49 cells . On the other hand , while lower levels ( P < 0 . 05 ) of Zeb1 mRNA were detected in MB49 - I cells compared to those in MB49 cells , no detectable levels of Twist were found in either BC cell line . Findings in the present report are in line with a previous study by Gou et al . ( 31 ) , describing a relationship between a higher Snail expression , and the presence of advanced tumors among 332 human samples from patients with superﬁcial BC evaluated by immunohistochemistry ; in the same report , Snail was a predictor of disease recurrence and progression . Moreover , a higher expression of Slug was also previously reported in inﬁltrating tumors , in a study of 47 patients diagnosed with BC ( 32 ) . Finally , Tang et al . ( 33 ) reported signiﬁcantly lower expression levels of Twist1 mRNA in 13 paired urothelial bladder cancer specimens than the non - tumor mucosas . The cadherin switching phenomenon represents an important aspect of the EMT , and it has been typically described as a process by which E - cadherin expression is replaced by N - cadherin expression ( 34 , 35 ) . However , later studies found an abnormal expression of other members of the superfamily as part of the cadherin switch ( 36 ) . Thus , the E - cadherin to N - cadherin and / or P - cadherin switch phenomenon was analyzed in the in vitro murine BC model . Regarding N - cadherin , mRNA expression analysis revealed signiﬁcant lower levels of this transcript in MB49 - I compared to MB49 cells ( Figure 2F ) . In line with these ﬁndings , ﬂuorescence immunocytochemistry revealed a lower signal for N - cadherin in MB49 - I compared to MB49 cells ( Figure 2G ) . Previous studies have reported ∼ 40 % of bladder tumors depicting a positive signal for this protein ( 37 – 39 ) . This percentage was found in either NMIBC ( 37 ) or MIBC ( 40 ) tumor cohorts , showing that not all invasive tumors show increased expression of N - cadherin . While some of these studies showed an association between increased N - cadherin expression and recurrence - free survival ( 37 , 38 ) , others failed to ﬁnd a relationship between N - cadherin expression with clinicopathological parameters ( 39 , 41 ) . In line with the results of the present report , a study by Jäger et al . ( 42 ) found a positive N - cadherin expression in superﬁcial ( Ta / T1 ) cases to be a risk factor , and a lack of expression in MIBC cases correlated with reduced patient survival . Moreover , they reported 14 % ( 13 / 92 ) N - cadherin - negative ( 2 × T2 , 8 × T3 , and 3 × T4 ) MIBC , and 12 / 13 patients died of BC within 18 months ; the average survival time in this group was 3 . 5 - fold lower than in MIBC cases expressing N - cadherin . In another study , the N - cadherin - negative muscle - invasive tissue samples ( “high risk” ) depicted a 2 - fold higher expression level of the VEGF angiogenic factor than N - cadherin - positive muscle invasive cancers ( 43 ) , highlighting the association between negative N - cadherin expression in BC and tumor aggressiveness . With regard to P - cadherin assessment , transcript ( Figure 2H ) and protein ( Figure 2I ) levels were higher ( P < 0 . 05 ) in MB49 - I cells compared to MB49 cells . Results from this report agree with several studies that show P - cadherin expression in association with BC progression . Rieger - Christ et al . ( 44 ) described P - cadherin in over 90 % of the cases in a cohort of ∼ 100 tumors ; authors also reported N - cadherin expression , absent in normal urothelium but localized to the membrane in focal areas of the tumor mass in invasive tumors .

Increased P - cadherin expression was associated with worse BC - speciﬁc survival , and P - cadherin status was an independent prognostic factor ( alongside grade and stage ) . Moreover , functional in vitro experiments showed that altering the balance of E - and P - cadherin in favor of P - cadherin expression enhanced anchorage - independent growth , and P - cadherin alone was unable to mediate normal cell – cell adhesion . Authors concluded that P - cadherin expression promoted a more malignant and invasive phenotype of BC , even in the presence of E - cadherin . The same year Mandeville et al . ( 46 ) reported the expression of P - cadherin in BC , and found that P - cadherin overexpression induced an increase in migratory capacity in in vitro models . Van Marck et al . ( 47 ) later showed that stable knockdown of P - cadherin in RT - 112 BC cells diminished invasion and migration , and promoted intercellular adhesion , supporting a P - cadherin transformation promoting role in BC . Mandeville et al . ( 46 ) suggested P - cadherin to have a role in regulating migration of basal cells to the intermediate cell layer in normal urothelium as well as a role in neoplastic progression , while Bryan et al . ( 45 ) suggested that P - cadherin may be induced in BC to reduce cell - cell adhesion and to enable cell - matrix interactions as a ﬁrst step to invasion in a similar fashion to N - cadherin . In Jäger’s report ( 42 ) , high P - cadherin gene expression proved to be an independent favorable prognostic factor of cancer - related survival , and a risk factor of recurrence in superﬁcial cancers after tumor resection . In 2014 , Wang et al . ( 48 ) reported a correlation between P - cadherin high expression and tumor progression . Finally , using a molecular approach , a thorough report by Choi and collaborators described the identiﬁcation of distinct basal and luminal subtypes of MIBC with diﬀerent sensitivities to frontline ; in the study , CDH3 , the gene encoding P - cadherin was listed among gene classiﬁers for muscle invasive progression and muscle invasive overall survival ( 49 ) . Protein Assessment of the Adherent Complex Members . β - Catenin Expression Analysis Considering the relevance of the adhesion complex integrity upon cell - cell adhesiveness , and the decreased E - cadherin mRNA and protein levels found in MB49 - I cells , subcellular localization of some members of the adherent complex was evaluated . Localization of E - cadherin and β - catenin was determined in both cell lines by ﬂuorescence immunocytochemistry , while evaluation of the actin cytoskeleton organization was performed by Filamentous actin ( F - actin ) staining with Alexa488 - phalloidin . As shown in Figure 3A ( top panels ) , immunolocalization analysis of E - cadherin in whole cells revealed a signal in the cytoplasm of both cell lines , but ∼ 50 % less intense in MB49 - I cells , in line with the results of mRNA and total E - cadherin protein expression analysis described above ( Figure 2C ) . On the other hand , β - catenin immunolocalization analysis revealed striking diﬀerences between both cell lines ; while in MB49 cells the β - catenin signal was localized mainly in the cytoplasm , in MB49 - I cells it was stronger and distributed in the cytoplasm and nucleus ( Figure 3A , middle panel ) . F - actin ﬂuorescence distribution evidenced stress ﬁbers in both lines ( Figure 3A , bottom panels ) . To conﬁrm a higher expression of β - catenin protein in MB49 - I cells , Western immunoblotting of total protein extracts from both cell lines was done . In agreement with the immunocytochemistry results , higher levels of β - catenin were detected in MB49 - I cells compared to MB49 cells ( Figures 3B , C ) . These changes could not be attributed to an increase in mRNA expression ( MB49 : 1 ; MB49 - I : 0 . 978 ± 0 . 043 ; ns ) . Based on these ﬁndings , β - catenin subcellular distribution was quantiﬁed , ﬁnding nuclear localization in ∼ 80 % of MB49 - I cells and in ∼ 10 % of MB49 cells ( Figure 3D ) . This evaluation was also done in cytoplasmic and nuclear protein extracts ( β - tubulin cytoplasmic marker ; PCNA nuclear marker ) . As shown in Figure 3E , β - catenin signal in MB49 - I cells was weaker in the cytoplasmic fraction and stronger in the nuclear fraction , when compared to MB49 cells . In normal cells , β - catenin localizes at the cell membrane in a complex with E - cadherin ; cytoplasmic β - catenin is maintained at low levels , being constitutively captured by a destruction complex that facilitates its N - term phospho targeting , ubiquitination and destruction in the proteasome . The adenomatous polyposis coli ( APC ) and Axin are structural components of the destruction complex , while CK1 casein kinases and 3 glycogen synthase kinase - 3 β ( GSK - 3 β ) are recruited to serine phosphorylate β - catenin . Under certain conditions , β - catenin accumulates in the cytosol and is shuttled to the nucleus , where it binds and forms complexes with transcription factors of the lymphoid enhancer factor ( Lef ) / T - cell factor ( TCF ) family , and activates target Frontiers in Oncology | www . frontiersin . org 8 March 2020 | Volume 10 | Article 283 Mencucci et al .

N - terminal β - catenin phosphorylation is required for its degradation and for attenuating its eﬀect on transcription ( 50 – 52 ) . β - catenin nuclear localization has been related to tumor progression and aggressiveness in several tissues ( i . e . , breast , renal , and colorectal cancer ) ; in particular , there are reports describing an aberrant localization of β - catenin in the cell cytoplasm and nucleus in BC ( 53 , 54 ) . Taking into account that β - catenin is phosphorylated in the degradation complex by GSK - 3 β in Ser33 , Ser37 , and Ser41 ( 52 , 55 ) , presence and localization of pSer33 - β - catenin were assessed in MB49 cells and MB49 - I cells , both by Western immunoblotting and ﬂuorescent immunocytochemistry using a commercial antibody . As result , lower levels of P - Ser33 - β - catenin were found in MB49 - I cells compared to MB49 cells ( Figures 3B , F , respectively ) , in agreement with β - catenin localization found in the MB49 - I cell nucleus . In line with these ﬁndings , Roy et al . ( 56 ) reported the results of next generation sequence analysis done in 15 primary bladder adenocarcinomas , in which mutations were found in CTNNB1 ( encoding β - catenin ) ( 3 / 15 , 20 % ) , including activating missense mutations at known hotspots ( p . D32N and p . S45F ) and ampliﬁcation ; in the study , the immunohistochemistry analysis revealed β - catenin nuclear localization in mutated samples . In addition to these ﬁndings , the COSMIC database lists 10 / 29 mutations ( all missense ) around Ser33 , Ser41 , and adjacent residues , from 764 samples of transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder evaluated . The list is shown in Supplementary Table 4 . Expression Analysis of Ephrin - B1 and Related Proteins in MB49 and MB49 - I Cells Studies have identiﬁed Ephrin - B1 as a target gene of β - catenin nuclear transcriptional activity ( 57 – 59 ) . Moreover , Ephrin - B1 expression has been associated to tumor progression and invasion in cell models ( 60 , 61 ) and in diﬀerent cancer types [ hepatocarcinoma : ( 62 ) , ovarian : ( 63 ) , gastric : ( 64 ) ] . Other members of the Ephrin family have been studied in BC . Among them , a higher expression of Ephrin - A1 and EphA2 receptor was found in BC cell lines and in advancing tumor compared to controls , as well as an association between their expression and tumor stage ( 65 ) . Moreover , a high expression of arterial Ephrin - B2 and venous EphB4 receptor was reported in BC , and proposed to contribute to tumor angiogenesis ( 66 ) . Based on this background information , Ephrin - B1 mRNA and protein levels were determined in both cell lines , ﬁnding signiﬁcantly higher expression of Ephrin - B1 transcript in MB49 - I cells than in MB49 cells ( Figure 4A ) . In agreement with these results , a stronger signal for Ephrin - B1 was found in MB49 - I than in MB49 protein cell extracts ( Figure 4B ) . This increase was also evidenced by ﬂuorescence immunocytochemistry , with an Ephrin - B1 signal > 300 % higher in MB49 - I cells than in MB49 cells ( Figure 4C ) . To evaluate the association between Ephrin - B1 expression and an invasive cellular behavior , MB49 - I cells were transfected with Ephrin - B1 ( MB49I - siRNAEphrin - B1 cells ) or scramble ( MB49I - siRNAControl ) siRNA . The eﬀectiveness of the procedure was conﬁrmed by a decrease in Ephrin - B1 mRNA levels ( Figure 4D ) . MB49 - I siRNA Ephrin - B1 treated cells depicted lower migratory and invasive capacity than control cells ( Figures 4E , F ) . Co - expression of Ephrin - B1 and the EphB2 receptor has been observed in small cell lung cancer ( 67 ) , gastric cancer ( 64 ) as well as in medulloblastoma ( 61 ) . Also , their co - expression was related to metastasis by immunohistochemistry in a study done in 50 cholangiocarcinoma samples ( 68 ) . Based on these ﬁndings , EphB2 expression was evaluated in total protein cell extracts , ﬁnding 3 times higher levels in MB49 - I cells than in MB49 cells ( Figure 4G ) . These ﬁndings are in agreement with the association reported between high EphB2 expression and EMT induction and progression of human cervical cancer ( 69 ) , although they contrast with a report describing its decrease in human BC samples ( 70 ) . Among several signal transduction mechanisms , Ephrin - B1 interaction with EphB2 receptor results in its activation , which is followed by Stat3 recruitment , phosphorylation and enhanced transcriptional activation ( 71 ) . Deregulation of Stat3 signaling has been reported in several solid tumors , among them BC ( 72 ) , and its activation has been associated to tumor invasion and metastasis ( 73 ) . Thus , the expression of Stat3 and the Tyr705 - phospho Stat3 ( pStat3 ) activated form was analyzed in both cell lines , ﬁnding a 35 % increase in pStat3 / Stat3 ratio in MB49 - I cells ( Figure 4H ) . Moreover , the expression of Stat3 target genes , speciﬁcally Urokinase - type Plasminogen Activator ( uPA ) and its receptor uPAR ( Urokinase - type Plasminogen Activator Receptor ) was evaluated , ﬁnding higher levels of both transcripts in MB49 - I cells compared to Frontiers in Oncology | www . frontiersin . org 11 March 2020 | Volume 10 | Article 283 Mencucci et al . Ephrin - B1 and Bladder Cancer Aggressiveness MB49 cells ( Figure 4I ) . In line with these ﬁndings , uPA activity was previously reported in MB49 - I cells conditioned media ( 11 ) . These molecules play a fundamental role in tissue remodeling during invasion and metastasis , and their expression was related to BC poor prognosis ( 74 ) . uPA and uPAR expression has been related to β - catenin transcriptional activity in colorectal tumors ( 75 ) . Expression Analysis of E - cadherin , β - catenin , and Ephrin - B1 in Murine and Human Bladder Tumors Taking into account ﬁndings obtained in cell cultures of the BC murine model , orthotopic tumors were derived from both cell lines , and immunodetection of E - cadherin , β - catenin , pSer33 - β - catenin , and Ephrin - B1 was done in paraﬃn - embedded tissue FIGURE 5 | Immunohistochemical analysis of E - cadherin , β - catenin and pSer33 - β - catenin in murine and human bladder tissues .

The total score was calculated after adding both scores . The P - value was calculated using Pearson’s Chi square test . * P < 0 . 05 . Frontiers in Oncology | www . frontiersin . org 13 March 2020 | Volume 10 | Article 283 Mencucci et al . Ephrin - B1 and Bladder Cancer Aggressiveness immunolocalized at the cell membrane and cytoplasm of normal bladders and MB49 tumors , while MB49 - I tumors showed a signal in the nucleus in a high proportion of cells ( Figure 5A , middle ) . Moreover , pSer33 - β - catenin immunodetection revealed a strong signal in both normal bladder and MB49 tumors , but very weak in MB49 - I tumors ( Figure 5A , bottom ) . In all cases , protein subcellular localization and signal intensity was comparable to that found in both cells growing in monolayers . A similar analysis done in human tumor samples from patients diagnosed with BC , revealed a strong signal for E - cadherin in the cell membrane of sections of the tumor classiﬁed as non - tumor tissue , and a weaker signal in the cytoplasm of tumor sections from superﬁcial and inﬁltrating tumors , with lowest intensity in the latter ( Figure 5B , top ) , in agreement with previous reports in human BC ( 2 , 19 , 20 ) . β - catenin was immunodetected at the cell membrane of non - tumor bladder and superﬁcial tumors , but alterations in its expression and localization were observed as previously reported ( 19 , 20 ) . In particular , a cytoplasmic and nuclear signal was found in a subset of inﬁltrating tumors evaluated ( Figure 5B , middle ) . This localization of β - catenin was similar to that reported in 87 % ( 26 / 30 ) of MIBC evaluated , which was associated it with poor prognostic parameters , among them tumor grade , stage , microvessel density , vascular invasion , and lymph node metastasis ( 53 ) . For pSer33 - β - catenin , a cytoplasmic staining was observed in non - tumoral bladder and superﬁcial tumors , although with less intensity , while no signal was detected in inﬁltrating tumors ( Figure 5B , bottom ) . Regarding Ephrin - B1 immunodetection , MB49 - I tumors depicted a stronger signal compared to normal bladders and MB49 tumors ( Figure 6A ) . To assess Ephrin - B1 expression in human BC , two studies were done . First , fresh biopsies of tumor and non - tumor mucosa were obtained from 10 patients during radical cystectomy . Transcript expression assessed by real - time PCR revealed higher ( P < 0 . 05 ) Ephrin - B1 levels in tumor vs . non - tumor samples ( Non tumor = 0 . 001446 ± 0 . 0006982 , Tumor = 0 . 003612 ± 0 . 001740 ) . Ephrin - B1 immunohistochemical analysis was done in superﬁcial and inﬁltrating tumors ; normal bladder tissue sections found in tumor pieces were also evaluated . A faint or absent signal was observed in the urothelium of the non - tumoral section , while a signal was detected in all tumors ( Figure 6B ) . A low or high Ephrin - B1 score was assigned , according to the percentage of stained cells and the signal intensity . As result , a positive association ( P = 0 . 031 ) was found between Ephrin - B1 expression and tumor stage ( Figure 6C ) , with a high proportion of inﬁltrating tumors ( 15 / 18 , 83 . 4 % ) depicting a high score . Half of superﬁcial tumors ( 10 / 20 ; 50 % ) showed a weak signal for Ephrin - B1 , but 10 superﬁcial tumors depicted a strong signal , 6 of which were high grade , and other 2 were large tumors with multifocal sites . A positive association was also found between Ephrin - B1 expression and tumor grade ( P = 0 . 005 ) , with 79 % high - grade tumors depicting a high score . Likewise , 70 % low - grade tumors had a low score . No signiﬁcant relationship was found between Ephrin - B1 staining and the occurrence of metastasis . E - cadherin expression was also analyzed in the 38 samples , and compared with Ephrin - B1 results , ﬁnding 74 % tumors depicting an abnormal E - cadherin expression and high Ephrin - B1 expression , although no signiﬁcant relationship was found between both proteins ( Figure 6C ) . No signiﬁcant relationship was also found between E - cadherin signal and tumor stage , grade , or metastasis ( Supplementary Table 5 ) . Altogether , ﬁndings reported in this investigation further characterized changes in E - cadherin and EMT - related molecules in BC . Using a combination of bioinformatics , a murine model of tumor aggressiveness and BC patient samples , the expression of Ephrin - B1 and related proteins is reported for the ﬁrst time in association to BC progression / aggressiveness , gaining knowledge on the underlying mechanisms of BC . Evaluation of Ephrin - B1 in a multicenter study with a large cohort of patients will help conﬁrming its role as a biomarker of BC aggressiveness . Since antibodies , recombinant proteins , and peptides developed to target the Ephrin / Eph ligand - receptor system have been reported to reduce tumor growth in breast , prostate , colon , head , and neck cancer animal models and some molecules are under investigation in clinical trials ( 76 ) , additional studies with these molecules in BC will contribute to determine Ephrin - B1 role as therapeutic target of disease progression .
