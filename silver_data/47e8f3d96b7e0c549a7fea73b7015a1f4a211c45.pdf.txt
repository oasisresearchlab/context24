The ﬂatness of lamellipodia explained by the interaction between actin dynamics and membrane deformation The crawling motility of many cell types relies on lamellipodia , ﬂat protrusions spreading on ﬂat substrates but ( on cells in suspension ) also growing into three - dimensional space . Lamellipodia consist of a plasma membrane wrapped around an oriented actin ﬁlament meshwork . It is well known that the actin density is controlled by coordinated polymerization , branching , and capping processes , but the mechanisms producing the small aspect ratios of lamellipodia ( hundreds of nanometer thickness vs . several micrometer lateral extension ) remain unclear . The main hypothesis of this work is a strong inﬂuence of the local geometry of the plasma membrane on the actin dynamics . This is motivated by observations of co - localization of proteins with I - BAR domains ( like IRSp53 ) with polymerization and branching agents along the membrane . The I - BAR domains are known to bind to the membrane and to prefer and promote membrane curvature . This hypothesis is translated into a stochastic mathematical model where branching rates and directions , capping rates , and polymerization speeds depend on the local membrane geometry through the principal curvatures and the corresponding directions . This requires the knowledge of the deformation of the membrane , being described in a quasi - stationary approximation by minimization of a modiﬁed Helfrich energy , subject to the actin ﬁlaments acting as obstacles . Simulations with this model predict pieces of ﬂat lamellipodia without any prescribed geometric restrictions .
