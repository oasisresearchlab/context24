What initiates Arp2 / 3 - depen - dentactin polymerizationin this process is not well understood . Results : The Schizosaccharomyces pombe WISH / DIP / SPIN90 ortholog dip1p is an actin - patch protein that regulates the temporal sequence of endocytic events . dip1 D mutants exhibit a novel phenotype in which early events such as WASp localization occur normally but arrival of Arp2 / 3 , actin polymerization , and subsequent steps are delayed and occur with apparently random timing . In studying this mutant , we demonstrate that positive feedback loops of WASp , rapid actin assembly , and Arp2 / 3 contribute to switch - like behavior that initiates actin polymerization . In the absence of dip1p , a subset of patches is activated concurrently with the ‘‘touch’’ of a neighboring endocytic vesicle . Conclusions : These studies reveal a switch - like mechanism responsible for the initiation of actin assembly during endo - cytosis . This switch may be activated in at least two ways , through a dip1p - dependent mechanism and through contact with another endocytic vesicle . Introduction Temporal and spatial regulation of actin dynamics drives processes such as cell migration , cell morphogenesis , membrane trafﬁcking , and cell division . Endocytosis in yeast has been established as a powerful system to study the activa - tion and function of Arp2 / 3 - dependent actin assembly in vivo . During this process , over 50 proteins gather in a sequential manner at discretesites onthe plasmamembrane to coordinate membrane invagination and scission to form an endocytic vesicle . Time - lapse imaging of these ‘‘actin patches’’ has deﬁned a stereotyped series of events that occur in about 30 s : arrivalofclathrinandadaptorproteinsattheplasmamembrane , followed by recruitment of the actin polymerization machinery including WASp , myosin type I , and Arp2 / 3 complex as well as a large set of other F - actin binding proteins , phospholipids , and F - bar proteins [ 1 – 3 ] . An attractive property of this system is that it is possible to analyze in a quantitative manner many discrete local events occurring at different sites on the plasma membrane , all in the presence of a common cytoplasm [ 4 – 6 ] . Actin ﬁlaments , which only arrive partway through this process , are an essential component of endocytosis in yeast . Actin polymerization has been proposed to provide force to overcome the high internal turgor pressure for membrane invagination [ 7 ] and contribute to the scission process by generating tension along the endocytic pit with amphiphysins or with myosin I [ 8 , 9 ] . Actin is also needed for the recruitment of many endocytic proteins to the site [ 10 , 11 ] . The nucleation and formation of branched actin ﬁlaments at the patch are mediated by the Arp2 / 3 complex [ 12 , 13 ] . How the initiation of actin assembly is triggered is still not clear . Although several conserved Arp2 / 3 activators have been identiﬁed , a key factor is the Arp2 / 3 activator wsp1p ( the WASp ortholog ) [ 12 , 14 ] . However , it is not known whether wsp1p activity itself is regulated , because unlike mammalian WASp / WAVE proteins , yeast WASp is not regulated by autoin - hibition and does not contain a CRIB domain for cdc42 GTPase interaction [ 15 ] . The WISH / DIP family of proteins ( which also includes SPIN90 in humans and Ldb17 in budding yeast has poorly understood functions in regulating actin dynamics [ 16 – 22 ] . In mammalian cells , this protein is implicated as both a positive regulator of Arp2 / 3 and a negative regulator of the formin mDia2 and has been shown to interact directly with the Arp2 / 3 complex , WASp , G - actin and F - actin , and the FH2 domain of mDia . In vivo , reducing WISH / DIP expression leads to defective cell migration , formation of prominent ﬁlopodia , and reduced levels of receptor - mediated endocytosis [ 19 , 23 ] . Its potentially complex functions , especially in vivo , remain to be deﬁned rigorously . Here , we study the mechanism of initiation of actin assembly at the endocytic patch . We ﬁnd that the S . pombe WISH / DIP ortholog dip1p has a novel role in the temporal regulation of Arp2 / 3 - based actin assembly at the patch ; it does not appear to be a formin regulator . dip1 D mutants exhibit an unusual phenotype in that actin assembly in patches is delayed for highly variable amounts of time . Through the study of these mutant cells , we ﬁnd that the mechanism for initiation of actin polymerization has switch - like properties . In this switch , posi - tive feedback loops between WASp , Arp2 / 3 , and rapid actin polymerization may work together to produce a local burst of actin assembly for endocytosis . Results Dip1p Regulates Actin - Patch Formation and Endocytosis The sequence of the S . pombe WISH / DIP ortholog dip1p ( SPBC24c6 . 10c ) predicts that it is a 43 . 6 kDa protein that contains the conserved leucine - rich region ( Pfam domain of unknown function 2013 ) but is missing the SH3 and proline - rich domains found in other family members [ 21 ] . S . pombe dip1 D cells were viable and grew at wild - type ( WT ) rates at a range of conditions ( see Figure S1 available online ) . They were morphologically indistinguishable from wild - type cells and exhibited normal cell polarization programs such as new end take off ( NETO ) . Alexa Fluor 488 - phalloidin staining , however , revealed profound defects in F - actin organization . dip1 D cells had fewer patches that contained F - actin : wild - type cells contained an average of 36 6 6 actin patches per cell whereas dip1 D mutants had 6 . 5 6 2 . 0 per cell ( n = 60 cells for each strain ) ( Figures 1A and 1B ) . These patches localized normally to cell tips and septa but appeared larger and stained * Correspondence : fc99 @ columbia . edu more intensely with phalloidin than in wild - type . Actin cables and rings were more numerous and robust in dip1 D ( Fig - ure S3A ) , and actin bundles in cables and rings were often abnormally long , looping around cell tips and emanating from the contractile ring , respectively . To test whether dip1p functions in endocytosis , we used an endocytosis assay based upon the localization pattern of GFP - syb1 ( synaptobrevin ) , an integral membrane protein that normally localizes on the plasma membrane and cytoplasmic vesicles , which are likely to be endocytic ( Figure 1C ) . In endo - cytic mutants such as wsp1 D ( WASp ) , myo1 D ( myosin I ) , and end4 D ( Sla2 ortholog ) ( Figure 1C and unpublished data ) , GFP - syb1 accumulated on the plasma membrane , reﬂecting a decrease in the rate of internalization .

As an additional assay for endocytosis , wealso foundthat dip1 mutants exhibitedadelay in the internalization of the dye FM4 - 64 ( Figure S2A ) . Dip1p Localizes to Sites of Endocytosis We determined the localization of dip1p by imaging a func - tional dip1 - GFP expressed at endogenous levels from the dip1 locus on the chromosome . Dip1 - GFP appeared as dim cortical dots that colocalized with the actin - patch marker arc5 - mCherry ( Arp2 / 3subunit ) , showingthatdip1pisacompo - nent of the actin patch ( Figure 1D ) . Dip1p arrived at the patch at 2 8 to 2 10 s ( relative to time of patch internalization , t = 0 ) , peaked in intensity at 2 2 to 2 4 s , internalized with other patch components , and disassociated from the patch 2 – 4 s after internalization . The peak of dip1p accumulation preceded the peak in Arc5p by 2 – 4 s ( Figures 1E and 1F ) . This timing was very similar to that of wsp1p ( WASp ) [ 4 ] ( Figure 1G ; Figure 3B ) . Quantitation of peak dip1 - GFP ﬂuorescence in patches showed that it was present in about 20 molecules / patch , similar to clc1p ( clathrin light chain ; estimated at 30 – 40 mole - cules / patch ) , and was much less bright than wsp1p or arc5p ( about 150 molecules / patch ) [ 6 ] ; although the absolute numbers in this analysis can be subject to caveats , these ratios indicate that dip1p is substoichiometric to wsp1p and the Arp2 / 3 complex . To test whether dip1p localization is actin dependent , we treated cells with 200 m M latrunculin A ( Lat A , an actin - mono - mer - sequestering drug ) . Dip1p accumulated in dots at the cortex , indicating that the cortical localization of dip1p is primarily F - actin independent ( Figure S3 ) . Dip1p May Not Affect Formin Activity In Vivo Because the mammalian ortholog WISH / DIP has been found to act as an inhibitor of the mDia formin in vitro [ 21 ] , we tested whether dip1p regulates for3p , a formin that assembles actin cables at cell tips [ 24 ] . Dip1p localization and dynamics were independent of for3p and actin cables and did not exhibit appreciable colocalization with for3p ( Figure S3 ) . For3p local - ization was not affected in dip1 mutants . Furthermore , the rate of for3p dot movement , which corresponds to the rate of for - min - based actin polymerization in the cable [ 25 ] , was normal . Thus , although there is an increase in actin cable structures and an apparent increase in actin ﬁlaments in the cytokinetic ring in dip1 D mutants , similar to an increase in ﬁlopodia seen in WISH / DIP knockdown cells , this effect could be a secondary effect of the decrease in the amount of actin polymerized by Arp2 / 3 . Similar increases in cables are also seen in wsp1 and arp2 / 3 ﬁssion yeast mutants ( our unpublished data ) , and in cells overexpressing the patch protein gmf1p ( an ADF - related factor ) [ 26 ] . Our results suggest that dip1p has a primary func - tion in regulating Arp2 / 3 - dependent actin polymerization and not formins . Dip1 Regulates the Timing of an Actin Assembly Switch In order to determine which step in the actin - patch assembly pathway is compromised in dip1 D cells , we examined the localization of several patch components . Sla1p and wsp1p ( WASp ) , which both appear early at the patch , localized to a similar number of cortical sites in wild - type and dip1 D cells ( Figure 2A ; Figure S4 ) . In contrast , the number of patches con - taining myo1p ( myosin I ) and arc5p ( Arp2 / 3 subunit ) were reduced by over 70 % ( n = 20 cells ) . Thus , together with the phalloidin staining data , these results suggest that dip1p is needed for the efﬁcient recruitment of F - actin , Arp2 / 3 , and other patch components downstream of wsp1p . To assay the dynamic behavior of these patches , we imaged mYFP - wsp1 at individual patches using time - lapse micros - copy . In wild - type cells , wsp1p appeared at the plasma membrane and resided for an average of 8 – 10 s before moving into the cell interior and disappearing ; all wsp1p - labeled patches were internalized in < 20 s ( n = 72 patches ) ( Figure 2B ) . In contrast , in dip1 D , wsp1p remained on the cortex for highly variable periods of time ( Figure 2B ) . We measured the lifetimes of these patches using different acquisition periods to charac - terize a range of time periods ( Figures 2C – 2E ) because photobleaching limited the number of images that we could acquire . In some patches , wsp1p displayed rapid dynamics and internalized with similar kinetics as the wild - type patches ( in < 20 s ) . Other patches took on the order of hundreds of seconds ( over10 - foldlongerthanwild - type ) . By400s , however , 90 % of the patches internalized ( n = 72 patches ) . The distribu - tion of patch lifetimes at the cortex could be ﬁtted to a Poisson distribution , suggesting that a stochastic process governs the lifetime of the wsp1p - containing patch in dip1 D cells . Time - lapse microscopy showed that the recruitment of factors downstream of wsp1p was delayed . In wild - type cells , sla1p arrived at 2 20 s ( relative to time of internalization ) , wsp1p peaked in intensity at 2 8 to 2 10 s , and then arc5p peaked at about 2 2 s ( n = 20 patches ) ( Figure 1G ; Figures 3A and 3B ) . In dip1 D cells , wsp1p and sla1p resided at the patch for variable periods of time at a steady concentration without any detectable myo1p or arc5p ( Figures 3A and 3B ) . Then , arc5pandmyo1parrivedatthepatchand , 4 – 6slater , thepatch internalized ( n = 20 patches ) . The concentration of wsp1p also often increased 5 s before internalization . In contrast , the adaptor protein sla1p did not exhibit a peak before internaliza - tion , showing that only a subset of patch components increased at this stage . Subsequent steps of endocytosis were not delayed and proceeded with slightly faster dynamics than in wild - type cells ( Figure S5 ) , possibly as a result of the increased cytoplasmic concentration of certain patch compo - nents . Thus , dip1p is required for timing the initiation of events in actin polymerization but is not needed for a subsequent robust response once the process has been initiated . To further quantitate patch behavior , we counted the number of wsp1p proteins at each patch using ﬂuorescence intensity ( Figure 3C ) . In wild - type cells , wsp1p peaked to an average of 137 6 39 molecules ( n = 11 patches ) just prior to internalization . The average number of wsp1p proteins in the stable inactive patches in dip1 D cells was 120 6 53 molecules and then peaked to 224 6 102 molecules before internalization ( n = 12 patches ) , though with substantial variability ( Figure 3C , right ) . Because the number of wsp1p proteins in the inactive patches in the dip1 D cell was often equal to or higher than the peak number of wsp1p in wild - type cells , this analysis suggests that the number of wsp1p molecules in the patch is not the rate - limiting step for activation . These ﬁndings suggest that dip1p regulates the timing of a switch in which a patch containing low levels of wsp1p suddenly recruits more wsp1p , Arp2 / 3 complex , myo1p , and F - actin , which then ultimately lead to internalization . In wild - type cells , this transition occurs immediately after wsp1p arrival . In dip1 mutant cells , this transition is delayed and occursatstochastictimeintervals , butthensubsequentevents proceed with near normal kinetics . These data are not consis - tent with a model in which the slow indolent rise of an initiator reaches a threshold .

Dip1p in Actin Assembly Switch during Endocytosis 909 sharp transitions are indicative of a switch - like behavior that is triggered by a single event ( or small number of events ) . Turning on the Switch Is Dependent on Rapid Actin Polymerization Aswitchbehaviorsuggeststhattheprocessisregulatedbyone or more positive feedback loops . Properties of WASp , Arp2 / 3 , and actin are likely to contribute to such a feedback loop . For instance , WASp and actin ﬁlaments can help activate Arp2 / 3 , which nucleates actinﬁlaments off the sideof an actin ﬁlament , which then recruit more Arp2 / 3 and WASp [ 13 , 27 ] . Thus , one key element in this feedback may be actin polymerization . To probe the switch behavior in vivo , we measured the effects of attenuating actin - polymerization rates using dif - ferent concentrations of Lat A [ 28 ] . As an assay for this switch , we measured mYFP - wsp1 intensities in individual patches over time . A high saturating dose ( 200 m M ) of Lat A caused complete depolymerization of all F - actin structures [ 29 ] . Wsp1p still localized to patches but , unlike in untreated cells ( Figure 3 ) , its intensity proﬁles over time did not show any peak , and the patches did not internalize ( Figures 4A and 4C ) . Interestingly , at 2 m M Lat A , patches exhibited similar F - actin staining as that in wild - type cells . The rise in mYFP - wsp1 intensity leading up to its peak , however , was slower than in untreated cells ; patches did not internalize and gradu - ally disassembled over 30 s ( Figure 4B ) . We propose that this low dose of Lat A decreases the rate of actin polymerization in the cell without causing total actin depolymerization . Inter - mediate doses of Lat A ( 0 . 5 – 2 . 0 m M ) showed intermediate effects . To estimate the rate of ‘‘switch activation , ’’ we measured how rapidly mYFP - wsp1 intensity increased to its peak ( the slope of the upward part of the curves in the graphs in Figure 4C ) . A plot of these rates as a function of Lat A concentration showed a proﬁle that could be ﬁtted to a sigmoidal curve with a Hill coefﬁcient of 3 . 1 ( Figure 4D ) . These data suggest that a rapid rate of actin polymerization , rather than merely the presence of actin ﬁlaments , is a critical component in this switch ; at attenuated rates of actin polymer - ization , the switch occurs only slowly , or not at all . Further - more , the sigmoidal shape of the graph ( Figure 4D ) provides a possible indication of an all - or - none switch , suggestive of underlying cooperative mechanisms involving positive feed - back with actin polymerization . Effect of WASp on Patch Dynamics We examined the effect of wsp1p on the switch - like behavior in patch dynamics . wsp1 D mutants are viable but have defects in endocytosis [ 30 ] ( Figure 1 ) . In these cells , actin ﬁlaments still assemble at patches : there were a normal number of patches that contain sla1p , actin , and coronin ( crn1 - Tomato , an actin - dependent patch protein ) ( Figures 5A and 5B ) . However , these patches never internalized and instead gradually disas - sembled ( Figures 5C and 5D ) , similar to patches treated with 2 m M Lat A ( Figure 4B ) . Thus , wsp1 mutants may have an inad - equate actin - polymerization rate to activate the switch . These data suggest that wsp1p is normally a critical component of the switch . Functional Relationship between Dip1 and WASp Because the mammalian ortholog WISH / DIP has been shown to bind directly to N - WASp [ 22 ] , we tested whether dip1p func - tions by regulating wsp1p . We probed the genetic relationship between wsp1 + and dip1 + by characterizing a double wsp1 D dip1 D mutant . wsp1 D dip1 D mutants were synthetic sick for growth and nonviable at 36 (cid:1) C ( Figure 5E ) . These double - mutant cells exhibited a normal number of sla1 - GFP - positive patches but had a worse defect in the patch localization of the actin - dependent marker coronin than either of the single mutants ( Figure 5B ) . The patches that eventually recruited crn1p failed to internalize and then disassembled ( Figure 5C ) . Thus , the wsp1 D dip1 D mutant has properties of both of the single mutants . These results indicate that dip1p has functions apart from regulating WASp and may thus participate in a WASp - independent pathway . Activation of a Patch May Be Triggered by Another Endocytic Vesicle One current model for initiation of Arp2 / 3 actin polymerization is an actin ‘‘seed’’ model , in which preexisting actin ﬁlaments prime the burst of actin polymerization [ 31 ] . Although indi - vidual actin ﬁlaments cannot be easily visualized in live cells , we did ﬁnd evidence that activation of an actin patch is trig - gered by an actin - rich structure : another endocytic vesicle . Crn1 - Tomato is an actin - dependent marker that labels the endocytic vesicle for signiﬁcant periods of time after internali - zation [ 29 ] . Dual imaging of sla1 - GFP and crn1 - Tomato re - vealed that the activation and internalization of a patch were often preceded by a transient touch of an internalized endo - cytic vesicle ( marked by crn1 - Tomato ) . In dip1 D cells , about 30 % ( n = 97 patches in 16 cells ) of activation events were preceded by the arrival of another endocytic vesicle in its vicinity ( Figures 6A and 6B ; Figure S6A ) . In a typical case , upon the touch , the patch began to accumulate crn1 - Tomato in 1 – 3 s , signifying actin assembly , and then exhibited rapid internalization , often moving with the priming vesicle ( Fig - ure 6A , graph ) . Seventy percent of all touch events resulted in activation and internalization ( n = 45 patches in 15 cells ; Fig - ure S6B ) although , because of limitations in the resolution of light microscopy , it was not possible to determine in the remaining cases whether the vesicle came close enough . In somecases , apatchtriggeredtheactivationandinternalization of multiple patches at once ( Figure 6B ) . Because the activation of the patches is so infrequent in dip1 D cells , the tight temporal correlation of patch touching and activation was highly signiﬁ - cant . The stochastic nature of these visits provides one expla - nation for variable timing of patch activation in dip1 mutant cells . Similar events were also observed in a subset of wild - type cells at similar frequencies ( 80 % of touch events ; n = 18 patches in four cells ; Figure 6C ; Figures S6A and S6B ) , but the signiﬁcance of these touches was less measurable because all patches were activated in any event . As one test of this model , we predicted that patch activation would be reduced if patches cannot move toward each other . Patch movement is inhibited in cells treated with a low dose of Lat A , or in wsp1 mutants ; consistent with this model , these conditions in a dip1 D background caused severe defects in actin initiation [ 29 ] ( Figure 5 ) . Although internalized endocytic vesicles associate with actin cables [ 29 ] , analyses of for3 D dip1 D mutantsshowthatactincablesdonotcontribute to patch priming or to targeting of patches toward each other ( Figure S6 ) . These ﬁndings thus identify this ‘‘activation by touching’’ mechanism as an additional way to activate a patch .

Note that the organization of actin ﬁlaments is not known , and elements are not drawn to scale . Dip1p in Actin Assembly Switch during Endocytosis 913 complex in vivo . Here , we provide evidence that a switch - like mechanism is responsible for the initiation of actin assembly at each patch . The rapid kinetics , the stochastic timing of the switch in the absence of a trigger , and the sigmoidal curve for the dose - dependent effects of Lat A ( Figure 4D ) all support the existence of a switch - like mechanism for initiating actin polymerization downstream of wsp1p . Key elements of this switch include positive feedback relationships between actin assembly , accumulation of wsp1p , and recruitment and acti - vation of Arp2 / 3 . In this perspective , dip1p is a necessary element of a timer that triggers the switch , without being a necessary component of the switch or the actin - polymeriza - tion machinery itself . In the absence of dip1p , the activation of the switch no longer occurs within seconds but appears with random timing ; once activated , endocytosis then proceeds with normal ( or slightly elevated ) kinetics . These studies provide a working model for the initiation of Arp2 / 3 - dependent actin assembly in vivo . As clearly demon - strated in the dip1 mutant , WASp may localize initially on the cortex prior to actin assembly and arrival of Arp2 / 3 . Upon a triggering event , actin , Arp2 / 3 , and myosin type I are rapidly recruited for a highly local burst of actin polymerization . This observation is consistent with studies in both ﬁssion and budding yeasts [ 4 , 8 , 10 ] . A key question is , what triggers this burst of actin polymerization ? Our quantitative data are not consistent with a current model [ 5 ] , which proposes that the patch is triggered by a threshold concentration of wsp1p . Instead , one initiation event could be the addition of an F - actin seed to the system , which acts to recruit and acti - vate Arp2 / 3 [ 31 – 33 ] . A critical element contributing to this switch may be the rapid assembly of actin ﬁlaments . At low doses of Lat A ( 2 m M ) or in a wsp1 mutant , the patch contains F - actin , but the actin lacks the necessary dynamics for more explosive actin assembly needed to drive endocytosis . One potential explanation for this effect is a preference of Arp2 / 3 to bind recently polymerized actin rich in ATP - actin [ 34 , 35 ] . Our observations also suggest that there exists a program for patch disassembly that is independent of internalization . When the rate of actin polymerization is insufﬁcient for inter - nalization , for instance in wsp1 mutants or cells treated with 2 m M Lat A , the patch disassembles in less than a minute . This disassembly does not occur at the ‘‘arrest point’’ in dip1 D mutants , because these patches persist at that point for many minutes , but occurs in dip1wsp1 double mutants soon after a patch has attempted actin assembly . Thus , this disassembly occurs after the patch lifecycle has reached acertainstage , suggestingthatdisassemblyisalsoaregulated process . Dip1 , a Key Factor in Initiation of Actin Assembly We identify dip1p as an important element in triggering this actin assembly switch at the actin patch . In contrast to compo - nents such as wsp1p , dip1p is not needed for the burst of actin polymerization per se but appears to have a primary function in its proper timing . One speculative model consistent with several lines of data is that dip1p , along with the WASp , facil - itates the presentation of an F - actin seed for initiation . Although the biochemical function of S . pombe dip1p remains to be deﬁned , numerous interactions have been docu - mented in its orthologs . Mammalian WISH / DIP / SPIN90 has been shown to bind directly to N - WASp via its SH3 domain to activate Arp2 / 3p - mediated actin polymerization [ 22 ] and to interact with F - and G - actin and other components of the endocytic machinery such as syndapin , dynamin , and the Arp2 / 3 complex [ 18 , 19 , 23 ] . In S . cerevisiae , Ldb17 localizes faintly to the patch with similar kinetics as dip1p [ 17 ] . ldb17 mutants also exhibit a small number of abnormally large actin patches and have endocytic defects . A C - terminal proline - rich domain ( PRD ) of Ldb17 binds to the SH3 domains of Sla1 and Bzz1 . S . pombe dip1p , however , lacks the SH3 and PRD domains required for many of these interactions but retains a conserved leucine - rich region ( LRR ) that has been implicated in the binding of the Arp2 / 3 complex , F - and G - actin , and formins in the mammalian ortholog [ 19 , 21 ] . Thus , it will be informative to compare the functions and molecular interac - tions among these family members . One curious aspect of the dip1 mutants is how healthy and polarized these cells are , despite strongly reduced levels of endocytosis . wsp1 D mutants , which have no detectable endo - cytic internalization as measured by patch imaging , are also viable , but have growth defects [ 30 ] . These observations suggest that clathrin - mediated endocytosis may not be essen - tial for viability in S . pombe and that even strongly reduced rates are sufﬁcient for cell growth and polarization in the laboratory . Priming a Patch with Another Patch Our direct observations suggest that an actin polymerization event can be primed by the touch of another endocytic vesicle . A correlation between the activation of a patch and the touch of another visiting patch appeared to be highly signiﬁcant in dip1 mutant cells , and similar events were observed in wild - type cells as well . We propose that these visiting vesicles , which are actively polymerizing actin [ 29 ] , provide ATP - rich actin seeds for triggering actin polymerization at the patch site or some other critical component . It is not clear whether these events are analogous to those observed in budding yeast , where the early endosome , a larger component that is not actin rich , appears to move and ‘‘eat up’’ patches [ 36 ] . Analogies to the Cell Cycle These studies highlight similarities of endocytosis to the cell division cycle : both are characterized by the orchestrated progression of events that are temporally regulated by switch - like mechanisms at key transition points [ 37 – 39 ] . In this light , dip1p is analogous to a cell - cycle regulatory factor that controls the transition from one cell - cycle phase to the next . Although cell - cycle mutants in which cell - cycle periods are either slower or faster are well known [ 40 ] , curiously , to our knowledge , no cell - cycle mutant has been identiﬁed quite like dip1 D , in which the length of a cell - cycle phase ( like G1 phase ) is rendered highly variable with a random distribution . Additional contrasts and comparisons between endocytosis and the cell cycle are likely to yield general conceptual insights into the regulation of complex biological programs .
