Ori - McKenney Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology , University of California , Davis , Davis , CA 95616 , USA ( Dated : June 13 , 2023 ) Abstract Cells remodel their cytoskeletal networks to adapt to their environment . Here , we analyze the mechanisms utilized by the cell to tailor its microtubule landscape in response to changes in osmolar - ity that alter macromolecular crowding . By integrating live cell imaging , ex vivo enzymatic assays , and in vitro reconstitution , we probe the impact of acute perturbations in cytoplasmic density on microtubule - associated proteins ( MAPs ) and tubulin posttranslational modifications ( PTMs ) , un - raveling the molecular underpinnings of cellular adaptation via the microtubule cytoskeleton . We find that cells respond to fluctuations in cytoplasmic density by modulating microtubule acetylation , detyrosination , or MAP7 association , without differentially affecting polyglutamylation , tyrosina - tion , or MAP4 association . These MAP - PTM combinations alter intracellular cargo transport , enabling the cell to respond to osmotic challenges . We further dissect the molecular mechanisms governing tubulin PTM specification , and find that MAP7 promotes acetylation by biasing the conformation of the microtubule lattice , and directly inhibits detyrosination . Acetylation and dety - rosination can therefore be decoupled and utilized for distinct cellular purposes . Our data reveal that the MAP code dictates the tubulin code , resulting in remodeling of the microtubule cytoskeleton and alteration of intracellular transport as an integrated mechanism of cellular adaptation . Introduction Adaptation is key for survival . During their lifetimes , cells will be exposed to a variety of conditions to which they must adapt to maintain homeostasis . A part of this adaptation response is an expansive repertoire of pro - teins to remodel their cytoskeletal networks . The micro - tubule cytoskeleton is dynamically regulated by a range of microtubule - associated proteins ( MAPs ) , tubulin post - translational modifications ( PTMs ) , and the expression of distinct tubulin isotypes [ 1 – 5 ] . Structural MAPs , such as MAP7 , MAP4 , and tau , that co - purify with polymer - ized brain tubulin and bind along the shaft of the lattice , can stabilize and bundle microtubules , alter the spacing of tubulin dimers within the lattice , and facilitate or in - hibit kinesin and dynein motor transport [ 6 – 12 ] . Tubulin PTMs include luminal acetylation within the unstruc - tured α K40 - loop , and complex chemical modifications of the cytosolic unstructured C - terminal tails including ty - rosination / detyrosination and polyglutamylation [ 1 , 2 ] . Tubulin PTMs can regulate the dynamicity and stability of microtubules , alter the biophysical parameters of the microtubule lattice , and recruit specific effectors [ 13 – 17 ] . These two systems of regulation are referred to as the “MAP code” and the “tubulin code” [ 2 – 4 , 9 , 18 – 20 ] . We are only beginning to understand the interplay between these two codes . Some MAPs that have been shown to control microtubule dynamics , such as CLIP170 , or mo - tor onloading , such as dynactin , are affected by tyrosi - nation status [ 16 , 21 , 22 ] , but less is known about the effects of these PTMs on structural MAPs . Recent work has shown that doublecortin is necessary for the main - tenance of polyglutamylation in neurons [ 23 ] , which di - rectly promotes the binding of tau to microtubules [ 24 ] . How other MAPs and PTMs communicate and how cells utilize combinations of MAPs and PTMs for specific pur - poses are open questions . Dynamic microtubules exist in a dense cytoplasmic mi - lieu . The mechanical properties of cytoplasm influence several cellular functions ; however , cells can experience variations in osmolarity , and therefore macromolecular crowding , in response to metabolic , oxidative , or inflam - matory stress and as a result of aging or tumorigenesis [ 25 – 29 ] . Therefore , the cell must develop strategies to respond to these challenges . Prior studies have shown that increases in viscosity or macromolecular crowding facilitate microtubule stability , suppressing both micro - tubule polymerization and depolymerization , as well as reduce the efficiency and speed of motor protein trans - port [ 30 – 33 ] . We have little understanding of how cells respond to these global effects at the microtubule level through MAPs and tubulin PTMs , or how the cell re - models its microtubule network to adapt to a changing environment . Unraveling these mysteries holds the po - tential to uncover novel mechanisms underlying cellular adaptability and pathological transformation . Here we use osmotic challenges to acutely manipu - late the macromolecular crowding of cytoplasm and in - vestigate how the cell integrates the MAP and tubulin codes to tailor its microtubule cytoskeleton in response to these changes . We reveal that increasing cytoplasmic density promotes MAP7 association with microtubules and enhances microtubule acetylation . In contrast , de - creasing cytoplasmic density reduces the association of MAP7 with microtubules and augments microtubule de - tyrosination . Acetylation and detyrosination of micro - tubules are usually tightly linked in cells , but surpris - ingly , we find that the presence or absence of MAP7 selects for one modification over the other , thus decou - 2 pling them to be used in distinct cellular contexts . Us - ing ex vivo acetylation assays and in vitro reconstitu - tion experiments , we show that MAP7 binding promotes acetylation by allosterically altering the lattice to facili - tate α - tubulin acetyl transferase - 1 ( α TAT1 ) activity and prevents detyrosination by sterically interfering with va - sohibin 1 ( VASH1 - SVBP ) binding . Finally , we perform live cell imaging to reveal that increasing macromolecular crowding does not hinder all microtubule - based trans - port , but selects against retrograde transport of early endosomes without impeding anterograde transport of secretory vesicles . In contrast , decreased crowding re - sults in the opposite effect . Altering cytoplasmic den - sity therefore selects for specific modes of transport not simply due to changes in the physical properties of the cytoplasm , but through alteration of MAP association which directly impacts tubulin PTMs . Therefore , we re - veal that the tubulin code directly depends on the MAP code . Our results provide insight into how the micro - tubule cytoskeleton can be remodeled by distinct MAPs and PTMs to efficiently respond to variations in macro - molecular crowding . Results Cytoplasm density differentially tunes tubulin PTMs . We sought to understand how cells modulate their microtubule cytoskeletons in response to acute al - terations in cytoplasmic density . To manipulate cyto - plasmic density , we exposed cells to extracellular osmotic environments ranging from hypoosmotic to hyperosmotic conditions ( 200 – 400 mOsm ) , in order to either increase or decrease cell volume through the intake or loss of water , respectively [ 30 , 34 , 35 ] . We produced specific osmolar - ity conditions by varying the amount of mannitol , a cell - membrane - impermeable non - toxic sugar , to a hypotonic base solution while maintaining a fixed ionic strength [ 36 , 37 ] . To directly measure effects of these osmotic chal - lenges on cytoplasmic density , we expressed 40 nm diame - ter genetically encoded multimeric ( GEM ) nanoparticles in BEAS - 2B cells , a human lung epithelial line ( Fig . 1A ) . BEAS - 2B cells typically spread as a thin lamella when cultured on glass , largely confining the diffusion of GEMs in 2 dimensions , which we imaged using total internal re - flection fluorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy ( Fig . 1A ) . Using single - particle tracking [ 38 ] , we tracked GEM diffusion and measured their mean - squared displacements ( MSDs ) for cells that were acutely treated with either isotonic ( 310 mOsm , control ) , hypotonic ( 250 mOsm ) and hyper - tonic ( 400 mOsm ) solutions ( Fig . 1B ) . As has been ob - served for other cell types [ 39 ] , the measured MSDs were linear functions of delay time τ , with measured diffusion coefficients of 0 . 068 – 0 . 012 , 0 . 19 – 0 . 05 , and 0 . 039 – 0 . 005 µm 2 / s for isotonic , hypotonic , and hypertonic osmolar - ities , respectively . The changes of GEM diffusion co - efficients indicate that cytoplasm density is indeed in - creased upon hypotonic treatment and decreased upon hypertonic treatment . We conclude that acute osmotic challenges can be used to manipulate the macromolecular crowding of the cytoplasm in living cells . We first examined how tubulin PTMs respond to vari - ations in cytoplasm density . We subjected BEAS - 2B cells to one - hour osmotic challenges and assessed the rel - ative effects on tubulin PTMs using both immunoblot - ting and immunostaining , which reveal average cell pop - ulation responses and changes at the single cell level , respectively . We analyzed the α - tubulin luminal mod - ification , acetylation of lysine 40 ( “acetylation” here - after ) , the α - tubulin C - terminal tail modifications , de - tyrosination ( Detyr ) and tyrosination ( Tyr ) , and the α - and β - tubulin C - terminus modification , polyglutamyla - tion ( PolyE ) ( Fig . 1C - G ) [ 2 ] . Unexpectedly , acetyla - tion and detyrosination , which are both considered mark - ers for stabilized microtubules and often occur on the same subsets of microtubules within cells [ 2 , 13 ] , re - sponded differently to osmotic shifts . As measured by immunoblotting , increasing cytoplasmic density caused a 3 . 5 - fold increase in α - tubulin acetylation levels , whereas decreasing the cytoplasmic density resulted in a 64 % de - crease in α - tubulin acetylation levels compared to the isotonic control ( Fig . 1C - D ) . Interestingly , decreasing cy - toplasmic density resulted in increased detyrosination levels ( 1 . 6 and 3 . 9 - fold increase for 250 mOsm and 200 mOsm , respectively ) , whereas α - tubulin tyrosination and polyglutamylation levels were insensitive to these osmotic shifts ( Fig . 1C - D ) . Similar results were observed by im - munostaining ( Fig . 1F - G ) . Again , hypertonic treatment caused a 3 - fold increase in acetylation staining ( Fig . 1F - G ) . Upon hypotonic treatment , acetylation staining was greatly diminished , whereas detyrosination levels were greatly increased and expanded within cells compared to the isotonic control . Both tyrosination and polyg - lutamylation signals homogeneously decorated the mi - crotubules and remained relatively unchanged for all the conditions ( Fig . 1F - G ) ; however , we did observe a 1 . 5 - fold increase in polyglutamylation in the hyperos - motic condition ( Fig . 1F - G ) . The immunoblotting and immunostaining results were broadly consistent , demon - strating that cytoplasm density differentially tunes tubu - lin PTMs . Furthermore , we observed similar differential regulation of tubulin PTMs in HeLa and RPE - 1 cells ( Fig . S1A - B ) , indicating a conserved response in various types of epithelial cells . Notably , changes in detyrosina - tion levels were far more pronounced in the cancerous epithelial HeLa cell line , which showed a 40 % decrease in response to the hyperosmotic condition and a 4 . 2 - fold increase in the hypoosmotic condition ( Fig . S1 ) , indicat - ing that detyrosination levels in cancer cells may be more sensitive to changes in cytoplasm crowdedness . Thus , our results reveal that the two most prominent markers of stable microtubules , acetylation and detryosination , are separable under specific cellular conditions .

We were therefore curious about the temporal response of these two mod - ifications considering acetylation occurs within the lu - men of the microtubule , while detyrosination occurs at the more accessible C - terminal tail [ 40 – 43 ] . Upon hy - pertonic treatment , acetylation levels gradually increased ( Fig . 1H - I , 1 . 5 , 1 . 7 and 3 . 6 - fold for 15 , 30 and 60 min , respectively ) , whereas detyrosination levels rose sharply after only 15 min of hypotonic treatment ( Fig . 1J - K ) , supporting the notion that it may take longer for acety - lation enzymes to access the microtubule lumen [ 44 ] . In hypoosmotic conditions , the decrease of acetylation be - comes evident only after 1 hr ( Fig . 1H - I ) , suggesting that cells need more time to process the removal rather than the addition of this modification . Cytoplasm density has distinct effects on MAPs . Tubulin PTMs have been shown to impact the associa - tion of microtubule - associated proteins ( MAPs ) with mi - crotubules [ 1 – 3 , 21 , 45 ] . Because our previous results revealed that changes in cytoplasmic density alter the microtubule PTM landscape within cells , we wondered if these changes might also influence the interactions of MAPs with microtubules . To test this , we performed im - munostaining to localize the subcellular distribution of four prominent non - neuronal MAPs in response to vary - ing osmotic conditions [ 46 – 50 ] . We first confirmed the expression of MAP7 and MAP4 in BEAS - 2B cells , while MAP9 was only present in cells undergoing mitosis , and DCLK1 expression was not detected ( data not shown ) . We therefore examined the subcellular distribution and relative expression of endogenous MAP7 and MAP4 in response to osmotic challenges ( Fig . 2A - C ) . Upon hy - potonic treatment , MAP7 dissociated from microtubules and became diffusive within the cytosol , especially in the lowest osmolarity condition , whereas MAP4 local - ization along microtubules appeared unchanged on mi - crotubules ( Fig . 2A ) . Compared to the isotonic control , MAP7 intensity increased 1 . 2 - fold in the hyperosmotic condition , but decreased in both hypoosmotic conditions ( 37 % and 19 % for 200 and 250 mOsm , respectively ) . In contrast , MAP4 intensity on microtubules increased un - der all conditions examined ( Fig . 2B - C ) . We next used immunoblotting to assess overall changes in MAP7 or MAP4 protein levels . Intriguingly , MAP7 was modestly upregulated upon hypotonic treatment and downregu - lated upon hypertonic treatment , whereas MAP4 levels remained unchanged ( Fig . 2D - E ) . The observed effects on MAP7 protein levels might be a cellular response to alterations in the association of MAP7 with microtubules ( Fig . 2A ) . Osmotic regulation of MAP7 levels was also observed in RPE - 1 cells , but not in HeLa cells , where MAP7 levels are physiologically higher ( Fig . S2 ) . To determine the effects on MAP7 and MAP4 microtubule binding behaviors under different osmotic treatments , we used a truncated CMV promoter to transiently express EGFP - tagged MAPs at reduced levels , allowing us to monitor MAP dynamics in live cells [ 51 ] . EGFP - MAP7 was able to associate with microtubules in the isoosmotic and hyperosmotic conditions , but did not bind micro - tubules in the hypoosmotic condition , whereas EGFP - MAP4 bound to microtubules in all conditions ( Fig . 2F ) . These results demonstrate that MAP7 and MAP4 re - spond differently to the changes in cytoplasm density . Unlike MAP4 , MAP7 association with microtubules is differentially affected by osmotic conditions , which inter - estingly correlates with the changes in acetylation levels we previously observed ( Fig . 1 ) . MAP7 promotes and protects microtubule acety - lation . In BEAS - 2B cells , MAP4 homogenously deco - rated microtubules , whereas MAP7 largely localized to the perinuclear region ( Fig . 3A ) . Acetylated and de - tyrosinated microtubules are also concentrated at the perinuclear region , but with distinct spatial patterns , in agreement with a previous finding that acetylation and detyrosination decorate distinct microtubule regions [ 52 , 53 ] . Interestingly , acetylation largely colocalized with MAP7 ( Fig . 3A ) . Combined with our above results , this suggests there may be an interplay between tubulin acetylation and MAP7 association . To define this inter - play , we first examined the effect on acetylation levels upon exogenous expression of MAP7 . We transiently ex - pressed full length MAP7 ( EGFP - MAP7 ) or a C - terminal fragment of MAP7 ( EGFP - MAP7 - Cter ) that lacks the microtubule - binding domains as a control . We found that expression of full - length MAP7 caused a 1 . 9 - fold in - crease of acetylation compared to MAP7 - Cter ( Fig . 3B - C ) . Furthermore , acetylation and MAP7 signals largely overlapped along microtubules ( Fig . 3B ) . We next exam - ined the MAP7 response to increased acetylation levels by treating the cells for 1 hr with tubacin , a drug that in - hibits histone deacetylase 6 ( HDAC6 ) [ 54 ] . Both the cel - lular distribution and levels of MAP7 protein remained unchanged compared to controls , despite the ∼ 9 - fold in - crease in acetylation signal that expanded to encompass nearly all microtubules ( Fig . 3D - F ) . These results are consistent with a previous finding that loss of MAP7 re - duces acetylation in nascent branches of neurons [ 10 ] , and suggests that MAP7 may promote acetylation in BEAS - 2B cells , but not vice versa . We next asked how exogenous expression of MAP7 would affect microtubule acetylation under different os - motic conditions , considering hypoosmotic treatment re - sults in a decrease in both acetylation and MAP7 as - sociation ( Figs . 1F - G and 2A - B ) . We subjected EGFP - MAP7 expressing cells to 1 hr osmotic treatments , then measured the fluorescent intensity of microtubule acety - lation by immunostaining ( Fig . 3G - H ) . Upon expression of MAP7 , acetylation levels were significantly higher in the 250 mOsm condition ( Fig . 1G and Fig . 3H ) , suggest - 5 A B C M AP 7 200 mOsm 250 mOsm 310 mOsm 400 mOsm Hypertonic Hypotonic M AP 4 D E MAP7 β - actin 2 0 0 m O s m 2 5 0 m O s m 3 1 0 m O s m 4 0 0 m O s m MAP4 β - actin 200 mOsm 310 mOsm 400 mOsm E G F P - M AP 7 E G F P - M AP 4 F 2 0 0 m O s m 2 5 0 m O s m 3 1 0 m O s m 4 0 0 m O s m 1 h 1 h 1 h FIG . 2 .

All p - values were calculated using a student’s t - test . ing that MAP7 promoted microtubule acetylation under osmotic conditions that normally resulted in a strong re - duction of this modification . We conclude that MAP7 binding along microtubules may protect acetylated mi - crotubules from deacetylation . Cytoplasm density alters microtubule - bound α TAT1 . We next aimed to understand the mechanisms by which cytoplasm density differentially regulates mi - crotubule acetylation , because unlike the other tubulin PTMs analyzed , acetylation levels were disparately af - fected by increasing or decreasing crowdedness ( Fig . 1 ) . Acetylation of α - tubulin preferentially occurs on poly - merized microtubules [ 40 , 42 , 43 ] . We therefore first ex - amined if there was any difference in the soluble versus polymerized tubulin pools in response to osmotic chal - lenges ( Fig . S3 ) . By fractionating soluble and poly - merized α - tubulin , we determined the ratio of polymer - ized α - tubulin to total α - tubulin [ 55 ] . Cells exposed to different osmotic treatments showed a similar ratio of polymerized α - tubulin ( ∼ 45 % ) , whereas nocodazole treatment decreased the ratio to ∼ 5 % and taxol treat - ment increased the ratio to ∼ 99 % , as expected ( Fig . S3A ) . Consistent with this , we did not observe signifi - cant changes in overall microtubule intensity within cells exposed to different osmotic treatments ( Fig . S3B - C ) . Next , we examined how changes in osmolarity and cy - toplasm density affected proteins levels and the activ - ity of the enzymes that control tubulin acetylation : α - tubulin acetyl transferase - 1 ( α TAT1 : acetylating ) and HDAC6 ( deacetylating ) [ 2 ] .

Osmotic shifts result in changes in cell volume [ 30 , 35 ] , and hence the intracellular concentration of enzymes ( and substrates ) if protein expression levels remain un - changed . We observed a minor decrease in the cell pro - jection area upon hypertonic treatment ( 400 mOsm ) and a small increase in the cell projection area upon hypo - tonic treatment ( 200 mOsm ) ( Fig . S3D ) . We did not detect a difference in cell projection area for the 250 mOsm condition , although this condition also caused a dramatic decrease in acetylation similar to the 200 mOsm treatment ( Figs . S3D and 1C - D ) . We were there - fore unconvinced that cell volume alone could account for the large differences in acetylation levels that we ob - served . To further test this idea , we transiently expressed mScarlet - tagged full length α TAT1 in BEAS - 2B cells and subjected the cells to different osmotic challenges ( Fig . 4E ) . In mammalian cells , the subcellular localiza - tion of α TAT1 is elusive , depending on the isoform and cell type examined , though it is rarely found to be as - sociated with microtubules [ 40 , 54 , 56 – 58 ] . In BEAS - 2B cells , α TAT1 - mScarlet was mostly diffusive , but showed a weak - microtubule - binding pattern only in control and hyperosmotic conditions ( Fig . 4E ) . While the fluores - cence intensity of α TAT1 showed no significant changes in response to osmotic treatments ( Fig . 4F ) , acetylation levels drastically changed , similar to the pattern observed without exogenous α TAT1 expression ( Figs . 4G and 1F ) , suggesting that dilution of α TAT1 in the hypoosmotic condition is not likely the cause of the osmotic regula - tion of acetylation . We next wanted to specifically analyze microtubule - bound α TAT1 - mScarlet following osmotic treatment . We first subjected α TAT1 - mScarlet - expressing cells to a brief , 15 min osmotic treatment , a time point at which acetylation is slightly increased in the hyperos - motic condition and unaffected in hypoosmotic condi - tions ( Fig . 1I ) . Then , we extracted the cytosol as pre - viously described [ 59 ] , and fixed and stained the cells for microtubules . Remarkably , α TAT1 - mScarlet signal was more evident along microtubules in the isoosmotic and hyperosmotic conditions when compared to cells without cytosol extraction . A considerable amount of α TAT1 - mScarlet was found localized within the nucleus , simi - lar to the localization of an alternative α TAT1 isoform in HeLa cells ( Fig . 4H ) [ 56 ] . We quantified the inten - sity of these two fractions and found that the nuclear - localized α TAT1 - mScarlet increased 1 . 4 - fold upon hy - pertonic treatment but remained unchanged upon hy - potonic treatment ( Fig . 4H - I ) . However , microtubule - associated α TAT1 - mScarlet increased 1 . 7 - fold upon hy - pertonic treatment and decreased 31 % ( 250 mOsm ) and 36 % ( 200 mOsm ) upon hypotonic treatments . The changes in microtubule - associated α TAT1 - mScarlet fol - lowing the osmotic shifts strongly suggests that the reg - ulation of acetylation by cytoplasm density might be achieved by modulating the binding of α TAT1 to mi - crotubules , which is inhibited in hypoosmotic conditions and promoted in hyperosmotic conditions . Microtubule lattice spacing regulates acetylation . To probe at the molecular mechanisms by which cy - toplasm density dictates the α TAT1 - microtubule in - teraction , we purified recombinant full length α TAT1 - mScarlet ( Fig . 5A ) to analyze its binding and enzymatic activity in ex vivo assays . The observed size of α TAT1 - mScarlet was 70 kDa by both SDS - PAGE and mass pho - tometry analysis , with ∼ 20 % of the α TAT1 - mScarlet population existing as a dimer ( Fig . 5A - B ) . We tested its ex vivo acetylation efficiency on the microtubule cy - toskeleton in detergent extracted BEAS - 2B cells [ 59 ] . In the presence of acetyl coenzyme A ( Acetyl - CoA ) , incu - bation with purified α TAT1 - mScarlet caused an 8 . 4 - fold increase in acetylation signal compared to untreated con - trol cells ( Fig . 5C - D ) . Next , we subjected cells to a 15 min osmotic challenge followed by the ex vivo acetylation assay . Before ex vivo acetylation , 15 min osmotic chal - lenges did not significantly change normalized acetylation levels ( Fig . 5E - F ) . Following acetylation by recombinant α TAT1 - mScarlet , the normalized acetylation levels de - creased by 27 % ( 200 mOsm ) and 12 % ( 250 mOsm ) af - ter hypotonic pre - treatments ( Fig . 5E - F ) , indicating that exogenous α TAT1 - mScarlet activity was attenuated af - ter hypoosmotic conditions . In contrast , when we ex - ogenously expressed EGFP - MAP7 in cells prior to ex - traction , exogenous α TAT1 - mScarlet strongly acetylated microtubules after all osmotic treatments ( Fig . 5G - H ) , suggesting that MAP7 binding to microtubules promoted α TAT1 microtubule binding , enzymatic activity , or both . The interdimer distance within the microtubule lattice can be expanded or compacted depending on several fac - tors . First , the nucleotide state of β - tubulin is thought to modulate interdimer packing . The GTP - bound state is correlated with an expanded interdimer distance , but hy - drolysis of GTP to GDP is thought to cause compaction of the interdimer distance by ∼ 2 angstroms [ 60 , 61 ] . However , structural studies on non - mammalian micro - tubule lattices have revealed that yeast and worm mi - crotubules exist in an expanded state regardless of nu - cleotide state [ 62 , 63 ] . Second , MAP association alters the interdimer packing regardless of the nucleotide state of the tubulin dimers , with tau and MAP2 inducing and maintaining a compacted lattice [ 11 ] , and motors such as kinesin - 1 inducing lattice expansion [ 64 , 65 ] . Third , drugs such as taxanes stabilize the expanded conforma - tion of the lattice [ 11 , 60 ] . In order to determine if differ - ent osmotic challenges may have altered the packing state of the microtubule lattice in our experiments , we ana - lyzed the binding of the taxane , SiR - tubulin , which labels 8 A B C D HDAC6 β - actin 2 0 0 m O s m 2 5 0 m O s m 3 1 0 m O s m 4 0 0 m O s m 2 0 0 m O s m 2 5 0 m O s m 3 1 0 m O s m 4 0 0 m O s m αTAT1 β - actin E W i t hou t cy t o s o l ex t r ac t i on D M 1 A a c e - α K 40 M e r ged α T A T 1 200 mOsm 250 mOsm 310 mOsm 400 mOsm F G α T A T 1 200 mOsm 250 mOsm 310 mOsm 400 mOsm M e r ged H D M 1 A I J 1 h 1 h 15 min 1 h W i t h cy t o s o l ex t r ac t i on 2 0 0 m O s m 2 5 0 m O s m 3 1 0 m O s m 4 0 0 m O s m HDAC6 β - actin 1 h 2 0 0 m O s m 2 5 0 m O s m 3 1 0 m O s m 4 0 0 m O s m HDAC6 β - actin 1 h HeLa HeLa BEAS - 2B RPE - 1 the expanded lattice [ 11 , 66 ] . We found that in BEAS - 2B cells , SiR - tubulin intensity increased 2 . 4 - fold after hyper - osmotic treatment and decreased 53 % after hypoosmotic treatment ( Fig . 5I - J ) . Taken together , these results in - dicate that increasing cellular density promotes micro - tubule lattice expansion , MAP7 association , and α TAT1 acetylation activity , whereas decreasing cellular crowded - ness promotes lattice compaction , disfavoring MAP7 as - sociation and α TAT1 - driven acetylation . Therefore , we conclude that the underlying microtubule lattice struc - ture changes in response to osmotic challenges , provid - ing a molecular rationale for the differential regulation of microtubule acetylation observed in response to changes in cytoplasmic density . 9 FIG . 4 .

Hypoosmotic conditions induced microtubule detyrosina - tion and the disassociation of MAP7 from microtubules ( Figs . 1 - 2 ) . In contrast , hyperosmotic conditions in - creased MAP7 association with microtubules and pro - moted acetylation ( Figs . 1 - 2 ) . We were therefore curi - ous how the presence of MAP7 on microtubules affects the enzymes responsible for these two modifications . De - tyrosination of α - tubulin is catalyzed by an enzymatic complex composed of a vasohibin ( VASH1 or VASH2 ) and a small vasohibin - binding protein ( SVBP ) [ 2 ] . Us - ing TIRF microscopy with purified proteins , we exam - ined the binding of VASH1 - SVBP on microtubules in the absence and presence of MAP7 , and found that mi - crotubule binding of VASH1 - SVBP was completely in - hibited by MAP7 ( Fig . 6A ) . In contrast , we found that α TAT1 microtubule - binding was only mildly reduced by the same concentration of MAP7 ( Fig . 6B ) . We analyzed published cryo – electron microscopy ( cryo - EM ) structures of microtubules decorated with MAP7 [ 67 ] or VASH1 - SVBP [ 68 ] , and observed a steric clash between the MAP7 and VASH1 binding sites on α - tubulin ( Fig . 6C ) . Therefore , the presence of MAP7 on microtubules may interfere with the detyrosination process by physically occluding VASH1 from the lattice ( Fig . 6C ) . The ob - served increase in detyrosination in hypoosmotic condi - tions may be due to dissociation of MAP7 , thereby fa - cilitating VASH1 - SVBP association with microtubules . α TAT1 binds inside the microtubule lumen and there - fore does not have overlapping binding sites with MAP7 [ 44 ] . Interestingly , in analyzing the cryo - EM structures of tubulin from a MAP7 - decorated lattice and tubulin from GDP - , taxol - or GMPCPP - lattices , we noticed that the α K40 - loop ( a . a . 38 - 46 ) containing the α TAT1 acety - lation site , K40 , was ordered in the MAP7 - bound con - figuration but not in the GMPCPP - structure ( Fig . 6D ; GDP and taxol lattices do not have ordered α K40 - loops either ) . These results suggest that MAP7 binding may facilitate the acetylation process through allosterically - induced ordering of the luminal α K40 - loop . Cytoplasm crowdedness differentially regulates cargo transport . We have demonstrated that cells re - spond to different cytosolic densities by altering tubu - lin PTMs , MAP association , and the underlying micro - tubule lattice state . But why ? Prior studies have de - scribed roles for tubulin PTMs , MAPs , and lattice spac - ing in directing motor transport [ 21 , 53 , 69 – 73 ] . We therefore investigated the impact of these altered micro - tubule landscapes on cargo transport . We examined the transport of two specific organelle types in response to al - terations in cytoplasmic density : secretory or dense core vesicles ( EGFP - Rab6A ) that are primarily transported anterogradely from the perinuclear region to cell periph - ery by kinesin - 1 and kinesin - 3 motors [ 73 ] , and early endosomes ( EGFP - Rab5 ) that are predominantly trans - ported in the retrograde direction by dynein - dynactin complexes ( Fig . S4 ) [ 74 , 75 ] . The movement of vesi - cles can be divided into two distinct factions : the immo - bile tracks with no obvious directed motion during the 3 min observation time window , and the mobile tracks with persistent directed motion ( Figs . 7A and S4 ) . Individual motile trajectories displayed switching between states of diffusive movement or “pauses” and states of directed “runs” that were attributed to active motor - driven trans - port along microtubules ( Fig . 7B ) , consistent with prior cellular studies on vesicle transport [ 73 , 75 – 77 ] . We used a previously developed algorithm to extract the distinct motion states and analyzed the mobile ratio of vesicles , the ratio of run time to total travel time for mobile vesi - cles , the velocities of individual run segments , and their run times [ 76 ] . The obtained MSDs of each run seg - ment revealed a parabolic function indicative of active transport ( Fig . 7C ) . These 4 parameters thus gave us an in - depth , unbiased characterization of the full spectrum 10 αTAT1 - mScarlet 70 kDa , 74 % 140 kDa , 20 % A B C D G 200 mOsm 250 mOsm 310 mOsm 400 mOsm E G F P - M AP 7 a c e - α K 40 D M 1 A M e r ged H I 75 100 250 50 37 25 20 kDa E F 0 nM 80 nM αTAT1 E x v i v o ace t y l a t i on D M 1 A a c e - α K 40 M e r ged DM1A ace - αK40 Merged 200 m O s m 25 0 m O s m 310 m O s m 400 m O s m Before ex vivo acetylation DM1A ace - αK40 Merged After ex vivo acetylation 15 m i n o s m o t i c t r ea t m e n t 15 m i n o s m o t i c t r ea t m e n t 200 m O s m SiR - tubulin 310 m O s m 400 m O s m J of the motions observed . Interestingly , under the hypoosmotic condition ( 200 mOsm ) , the Rab6A - vesicle mobile ratio , run time / total travel time ratio , run velocity and run time were all de - creased , whereas these parameters were unchanged for the hyperosmotic condition ( 400 mOsm ) when compared to the isotonic control ( Fig . 7D - H ) . The same analysis performed on Rab5 - positive early endosomes found that all four parameters decreased in the hyperosmotic condi - tion , while the run velocity and run time showed signif - icant increases in the hypoosmotic condition compared to the isotonic control ( Fig . 7I - M ) . Taken together , these results indicate that decreasing cellular crowdedness se - lects against anterograde transport of secretory vesicles in favor of retrograde transport of early endosomes , while increasing cellular crowdedness selects against retrograde transport of early endosomes . We hypothesize that the distinct transport behaviors observed for Rab6 - vesicles and Rab5 - positive early endosomes in response to differ - ent osmotic treatments is not simply due to changes in the physical properties of the cytoplasm , but may be at - tributed to the changes in MAP association and tubulin PTMs .

Increasing cytoplasmic density induces MAP7 - bound , acetylated microtubules , while decreasing cyto - plasmic density induces MAP7 release from microtubules and detyrosinated microtubules ( Figs . 1 - 2 ) . These dis - tinct microtubule populations in turn differentially in - fluence intracellular transport by molecular motors . We hypothesize that cells specifically utilize MAPs to con - trol tubulin PTMs and microtubule - based transport to efficiently adapt to challenging environmental conditions . What could be the physiological significance of our observations ? For cells to maintain a constant size , they must balance endocytosis and exocytosis [ 78 – 80 ] . In response to hypoosmotic conditions and decreased crowding , the cell responds by downregulating MAP7 - association and acetylation . The functional consequence of these events is a substantial reduction in anterograde transport of Rab6a secretory vesicles . This response may therefore be restricting secretory vesicle transport and fusion to prevent additional membrane insertion and cell swelling [ 78 , 79 ] . In response to hyperosmotic conditions and increased crowding , we observe a decrease in the ret - rograde transport of Rab5 early endosomes , possibly in - dicating a response leading to restriction of endocytosis in order to prevent cell shrinking . We therefore spec - ulate that cells modify their microtubule landscape to tune cargo transport and regulate endocytosis and exo - cytosis to protect themselves against drastic changes in cell volume and membrane tension [ 81 , 82 ] . To respond to changes in osmolarity , the cell may specifically target the microtubule binding properties of 13 FIG . 7 . Cytoplasm crowdedness differentially tunes cargo transport .

All p - values were calculated using a student’s t - test . MAP7 for multiple reasons . First , MAP7 differentially affects tubulin PTMs . We have found that MAP7 pro - motes the acetylation of microtubules . Acetylated mi - crotubules have been shown to be more flexible and more resistant to breakage [ 13 ] , which may be advantageous to withstand the increased viscosity and rigidity of the hy - perosmotic cytoplasm [ 35 , 83 ] . Under hypoosmotic con - ditions , MAP7 dissociation correlates with an increase in microtubule detyrosination , perhaps due to an indirect augmentation of VASH - SVBP binding to the lattice . In this case , the cell may require a microtubule population marked by detyrosination to support the increased dy - namicity that has been observed in hypoosmotic condi - tions [ 30 ] . Second , since MAP7 - family proteins are re - quired for the in vivo functions of kinesin - 1 [ 8 , 72 , 84 ] , their presence or absence will dictate kinesin - 1 driven transport . Not only does MAP7 directly recruit kinesin - 1 to microtubules [ 8 , 46 , 85 ] , but it protects acetylated microtubules , which are preferred by kinesin - 1 [ 69 , 86 ] . Therefore , MAP7 facilitates kinesin - 1 motility both di - rectly and indirectly . Increased viscosity or cytoplasmic density assumes a general role in slowing down motor protein transport both in vitro and in vivo [ 31 – 33 ] . In - deed , we find that an increase in macromolecular crowd - ing significantly decreases retrograde transport . Surpris - ingly , it does not disrupt anterograde transport of Rab6a secretory vesicles ( Fig . 7 ) , leading us to conclude that the cell may enhance MAP7 binding to ensure kinesin - 1 cargo transport of these vesicles to plasma membrane persists in the presence of increased viscosity and drag forces . The opposite is true under lower density condi - tions : MAP7 dissociation results in a significant decline in the anterograde transport of secretory vesicles , which may be necessary for the cell to manage cell swelling as described above . Therefore , tuning MAP7 association with microtubules equips the cell with various strategies for adaptation to changes in macromolecular crowding and cell size . We were surprised to observe a distinct decoupling of microtubule acetylation and detyrosination . Although both of these modifications are associated with “stable” microtubules [ 2 , 13 , 52 ] and often occur on the same sub - set of microtubules [ 52 , 53 , 86 , 87 ] , we have discovered that specific cellular conditions select for one PTM over the other , indicating that these modifications can be sep - arated and utilized for specific cellular purposes . Our results are consistent with prior studies that show acety - lation and detyrosination modifications are not always tightly linked , such as in cancer cells , in migrating cells , and upon microtubule regrowth after depolymerization [ 52 , 88 , 89 ] . Therefore , although these modifications are not mutually exclusive , we show here that MAP7 asso - ciation has the ability to promote acetylation and limit detyrosination , thus decoupling them . How does the cell control MAP7 association with mi - crotubules ? We have found that the underlying lattice state is altered in response to crowding conditions with a lower cytoplasmic density favoring compacted lattices and higher cytoplasmic density favoring expanded lat - tices . The expanded lattice correlates with increased binding of MAP7 and α TAT1 , and acetylation . The compacted microtubules in the hypoosmotic condition disfavor MAP7 and α TAT1 binding , indicating these proteins preferentially bind expanded lattices . Consid - 14 ering kinesin - 1 predominantly binds the expanded lat - tice [ 64 , 90 ] , it is logical that MAP7 , the primary re - cruiter of kinesin - 1 , and α TAT1 , the modifying enzyme that produces the preferred lattice of kinesin - 1 , also fa - vor the expanded lattice . We hypothesize that MAP7 binding may drive lattice expansion because overexpres - sion of MAP7 prior to hypotonic treatment appears to “lock” microtubules in a particular state that promotes α TAT1 association and activity . We previously showed that tau is a mechanosensitive MAP that actively com - pacts the expanded microtubule lattice [ 11 ] . MAP7 not only competes with tau , but displaces tau from the mi - crotubule [ 8 ] , consistent with MAP7 possibly facilitating lattice expansion . It will be interesting to explore how different cells employ these mechanosensitive MAPs in future studies . Together , this work characterizes the interplay be - tween the MAP code and the tubulin code in modulat - ing the biophysical parameters of microtubules to allow them to withstand changes in cytoplasmic forces , and in directing the intracellular transport of specific cargoes to respond to osmotic pressure and macromolecular crowd - ing . Overall , our data indicate that the cell utilizes its MAP toolbox to destine microtubules for precise func - tions in response to changes in its physical environment . [ 1 ] Hammond , J .
