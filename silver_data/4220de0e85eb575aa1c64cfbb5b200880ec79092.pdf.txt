As a result , interactive video lectures are increasingly being adopted in digital learning contexts for increasing interactivity . However , conventional video lecture lacks interactive learning activities ( ILAs ) that are an indispensable component of interactivity . Interactive video lectures can provide learners opportunities to obtain timely constructive support to produce effective learning outcomes because of ILAs . In order to carefully design and create ILAs for effective learning , instructors need to invest substantial efforts for conceiving the content and interactions of ILAs . This study proposed an approach to design the content of ILAs by leveraging collective intelligence ( CI ) gathered from the discussion forums specifically related to the content of video lectures . When learners exercised ILAs , meaningful interactions by speaking and gesturing worked as learning support to improve comprehension of learning materials . To evaluate the effects of the CI - based ILAs , an experiment was conducted with 90 university students , who were randomly and equally assigned to three different groups ( i . e . , embodied interactive , non - embodied interactive , and conventional video lectures ) . The results show that learners who learned with the embodied interactive video lecture performed better in comprehension and retention of learning contents than the other two counter groups . The findings also revealed that this approach does not impose any additional cognitive load on learners . The design guidelines derived in this study can serve as reference for instructors to create interactive video lectures with CI - based ILAs in digital learning contexts .
