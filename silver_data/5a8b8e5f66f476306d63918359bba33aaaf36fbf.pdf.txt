A fter transcription initiation , RNA polymerase II ( RNAPII ) pauses approximately 25 – 50 nucleotides downstream of the transcription start site because of the action of negative transcription elongation factors 1 . Release from this block requires the positive transcription elongation factor P - TEFb 2 , which is a het - erodimer composed of the cyclin - dependent kinase Cdk9 and the regulatory subunit Cyclin T . P - TEFb mediates the transition from transcription initiation to productive elongation of pre - mRNA tran - scripts by phosphorylation of the carboxy - terminal domain ( CTD ) of the largest subunit of RNAPII . In humans , the CTD comprises 52 repeats of the consensus sequence Y 1 S 2 P 3 T 4 S 5 P 6 S 7 that exhibits only some variations from the strict consensus towards the C - terminus 3 – 7 . Phosphorylation of Ser5 by Cdk7 and Cdk8 kinases of TFIIH and the mediator complex , respectively , has been described to be concomi - tant with transcription initiation , whereas Cdk9 of P - TEFb is sug - gested to phosphorylate Ser2 , which marks the elongation phase of transcription 3 – 8 . In addition , Ser7 of the CTD can also be phosphor - ylated , which has been linked to small nuclear RNAs ( snRNA ) tran - scription and recruitment of the integrator complex 9 – 13 . Whereas some genes , for example , those on CpG islands , can directly proceed to the elongation state by recruiting P - TEFb to RNAPII 14 , genome - wide studies suggest that the majority of genes in higher eukaryotes are under the control of promoter - proximal pausing 15 – 17 . Studies in budding yeast , whose RNAPII contains 26 hepta - repeats of the consensus CTD sequence , have recently identified gene class - specific CTD phosphorylation patterns and a widespread co - occurrence of such CTD marks at various stages of transcrip - tion 18 . Particularly , Ser7 phosphorylation is found early in tran - scription initiation and retained until transcription termination in all RNAPII - dependent genes . In line with these observations , the dynamics of CTD phosphorylations were found to be not scaled to the gene length but differ among genes with different promoter structures and expression levels 19 . High levels of Ser7 and Ser5 phosphorylations occur at the transcription start site , whereas Ser2 phosphorylation levels increase until they reach their peak about 600 – 1 , 000 nucleotides downstream of the start site 20 . These modifi - cations suggest a dual gradient model for increasing Ser2 and decreas - ing Ser5 phosphorylation across genes that regulate transcription 3 , 4 . In addition to these serine phosphorylations , arginine methylation at one specific residue of the CTD was shown to lead to misregulation of snRNAs as well as small nucleolar RNAs expression 21 . Here we investigated the specificity and activity of P - TEFb for CTD substrates by analytical means as a complementary technique to the use of antibodies raised against designed CTD epitopes . Using various CTD templates we applied mass spectrometry and kinase activity assays for quantification of CTD modifications . Intrigu - ingly , we found that every single hepta - repeat of a CTD substrate can be phosphorylated one time by P - TEFb , though , P - TEFb is una - ble to phosphorylate a CTD that has been pre - phosphorylated at Ser5 or Ser2 sites . Phosphorylation of Ser7 instead results in a four - fold higher catalytic activity for such modified templates . Inhibition of P - TEFb activity by its cellular regulation factor Hexim1 requires two distinct regions , a central PYNT motif and a C - terminal cyclin T - binding domain ( TBD ) . Both regions act synergistically on the P - TEFb subunits Cdk9 and Cyclin T1 , but are ineffective independ - ently . Addition of 7SK snRNA to Hexim1 significantly increases this inhibitory effect . The HIV - 1 Tat – TAR complex abrogates Hexim1 inhibition on P - TEFb to stimulate transcription of viral genes but does not change the substrate specificity . These observations pro - vide insights into the kinetics and substrate specificity of the tran - scription elongation factor P - TEFb , its phosphorylation signature on the RNAPII CTD and regulation by cellular factors . Results The number of CTD phosphorylations equals the hepta - repeats . We set up an in vitro phosphorylation assay using recombinant P - TEFb and CTD substrates containing 5 to 13 consensus hepta - repeats or all 52 hepta - repeats of human wild - type CTD ( Methods ) . The homogeneity and functional integrity of the P - TEFb complex was assayed by mass spectrometry , size exclusion chromatography and radioactive filter - binding experiments to confirm its catalytic activity ( Supplementary Fig . S1 ) . At a temperature of 30 °C , saturation of the CTD phosphorylation reaction was achieved within several hours of incubation , using twofold molar excess of the co - substrate ATP over the concentration of CTD substrate multiplied by the number of hepta - repeats contained in the substrate ( Fig . 1a ) . The increasing phosphorylation status of a glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) – CTD fusion protein and the gain in mass upon each phosphorylation is also visible as retained migration behaviour in SDS - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( PAGE ) analysis ( Fig . 1b ) . For a quantitative analysis , we used electrospray ionization mass spectrometry ( ESI - MS ) to determine the number of phosphoryla - tion events at various time points . Towards the endpoint of the reac - tion under saturating conditions , the number of phosphorylations as determined by mass spectrometry equals the number of hepta - repeats provided in the CTD substrate ( Fig . 1c ) . Although this result may seem trivial , it confirms a high specificity of P - TEFb for the CTD substrate given that three canonical serines are present in each hepta - repeat , two of them as the preferred Ser - Pro recognition motif for Cdk family kinase phosphorylation 22 , 23 . It also indicates that a continuous phosphorylation signature can be achieved by P - TEFb , leaving no gaps in the modification pattern of the CTD hepta - repeat structure . These results were confirmed by the potent phosphoryla - tion of a full - length CTD containing all 52 hepta - repeats including the acidic C - terminus ( Supplementary Fig . S2 ) . Although the highly negatively charged CTD was not accessible to mass spectrometry analysis , the large band shift upon phosphorylation and the passage into saturation suggest full phosphorylation of the substrate . A distributive CTD phosphorylation mechanism by PTefb . Mass spectra recorded in the course of the reaction provided addi - tional insights into the phosphorylation mechanism ( Fig . 1c ) . Assuming that all phosphorylated CTD substrates are similarly susceptible to ionization , the phosphorylation spectra recorded rep - resent a histogram of the number of molecules containing no , one , two etc . , phosphorylations , albeit without any information about the spatial arrangement of these modifications on the periodic tem - plate . The asymmetric distribution of the mass spectra recorded at 1 and 2 h after reaction start indicate a binominal distribution func - tion with two boundaries , ‘0’ and ‘8’ in this experiment . From the statistics of mass increase it can be concluded that the mechanism of CTD phosphorylation by P - TEFb is distributive , rather than proces - sive , as might be suspected from the repetitive nature of the sub - strate . An illustration of a distributive versus a processive reaction mechanism on a periodic matrix as the CTD and the correspond - ing histograms of mass distributions are shown in Supplementary Fig . S3 . However , it cannot be excluded that a consecutive phospho - rylation mechanism applies to the mode of P - TEFb action , meaning that once a first phosphorylation mark has been set on a substrate template , the following ( upstream or downstream ) hepta - repeat will be phosphorylated preferentially due to an increased recognition affinity . CTD - pSer7 is the preferred P - TEFb substrate . To analyse the pref - erence of P - TEFb for particular sequence compositions and phos - phorylation signatures , we designed a series of CTD peptides , each containing three hepta - repeats ( Fig . 2a ) . The peptides contained the unmodified consensus CTD sequence ( cons . CTD [ 3 ] ) , phosphoryl groups at Ser2 , Ser5 or Ser7 throughout ( pS2 - CTD [ 3 ] , pS5 - CTD [ 3 ] and pS7 - CTD [ 3 ] , respectively ) or lysines at position 7 ( K7 - CTD [ 3 ] ) . The hepta - repeat sequence YSPTSPK is indeed the prevailing altera - tion from the consensus CTD in higher eukaryotes , occurring eight ARTICLE  nATuRE CommunICATIons | DoI : 10 . 1038 / ncomms1846 nATuRE CommunICATIons | 3 : 842 | DoI : 10 . 1038 / ncomms1846 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited .

The peptides were marked at the C - termi - nus with a double arginine motif separated by a polyethylene glycol spacer for better ionization properties in the ESI - MS analysis . After 4 h incubation with P - TEFb , the consensus CTD substrate showed up to three phosphorylations corresponding to the three hepta - repeats provided as indicated by mass increases ( Fig . 2b ) . Intriguingly , we found that P - TEFb is unable to phosphorylate a CTD substrate that contained complete phosphorylation at Ser5 . Likewise , a peptide - containing phosphoryl group at Ser2 was not phosphorylated after 4 h incubation . In sharp contrast , P - TEFb read - ily phosphorylated a CTD template pre - phosphorylated at position Ser7 . The alternate K7 hepta - repeats again were phosphorylated , while phosphorylation of either Tyr1 or the recently identified Thr4 residues 24 , 25 abrogated P - TEFb activity for these pre - modified substrates ( Supplementary Fig . S4 ) . Notably , a similar recognition preference for the phosphorylation of cons . CTD , pS7 - CTD and K7 - CTD but not pS2 - and pS5 - CTD was seen for native P - TEFb that contained besides full - length Cdk9 also full - length CycT1 ( Supplementary Fig . S5 ) . Kinetics of P - TEFb - mediated CTD phosphorylations . From a time course of the reaction , a K cat / K M value of 2 . 15×10 4 M − 1 s − 1 was determined for the pS7 - CTD [ 3 ] substrate , whereas P - TEFb showed a K cat / K M value of 5 . 5×10 3 M − 1 s − 1 for the consensus CTD using an enzyme concentration of 0 . 1 µ M ( Fig . 3 ) . Surprisingly , the CTD sequence modified with a lysine residue at position 7 exhibited with a K cat / K M value of 5 . 2×10 3 M − 1 s − 1 similar substrate susceptibility for P - TEFb as the consensus sequence . Using longer CTD templates of 9 or 13 repeats uniformly modified with lysines at position 7 , as found , for example , in Plasmodium falciparum 5 , we noticed , however , a retarded phosphorylation activity of P - TEFb . Such effect could result from a changed accessibility of the serines , possibly caused by ionic interactions between lysines and phosphate groups . Reverse kinase order does not induce double phosphorylations . As an alternative progression of P - TEFb function , we thought to test Cdk kinase activities in reverse order such that after incubation with P - TEFb the CTD substrate was subjected to Cdk7 to test for higher phosphorylation modes .

S6 ) . Similarly , no additional phosphorylation marks were seen with Cdk7 for a P - TEFb pre - phosphorylated CTD - containing lysines at position 7 throughout . As before , the maximum number of phosphorylations equals the number of hepta - repeats presented . These results can be seen as indirect evidence that neither Cdk7 nor Cdk9 phosphorylates Ser7 to a significant extent as otherwise the number of phosphorylations should be higher than the number of hepta - repeats provided . P - TEFb is a Ser5 CTD kinase . Following the observation that P - TEFb neither phosphorylated a CTD template that contained continuous Ser5 nor Ser2 phosphorylations , we thought to re - analyse its substrate specificity by analytical means . Four different approaches were used to challenge the dogma of Ser2 phosphorylation by P - TEFb : alanine mutagenesis , western blot analyses , size constraints with either one or two alternating phos - phorylation sites and peptide modifications by serine acetylation . Using a similar design as described above , two CTD peptides were generated that contained alanine at either position 2 or 5 throughout ( Fig . 4a ) . Yet , although the Ala2 peptide was phosphorylated by P - TEFb up to three times , no significant phosphorylation was seen for the Ala5 peptide ( Fig . 4b ) . Western blot analysis using anti - phospho - CTD - specific antibodies raised against either pSer2 , pSer5 or pSer7 phosphorylations showed a prevalence of Ser5 phosphorylation by P - TEFb on the GST full - length CTD substrate ( Fig . 4c ) . Some Ser7 phosphorylations were also detected , whereas virtually no Ser2 phosphorylation marks were seen on the native substrate . Next , a 13 - mer CTD peptide containing Ser2 at its centre was synthesized , harbouring thus only one bona fide Ser2 site but two Ser5 positions . After 4 h incubation with P - TEFb , up to two additional phosphoryla - tions on the substrate template were detected by quantitative high - performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) analysis ( Fig . 4d ) .

To assign the site of phosphorylation in more detail , again a 13 - mer peptide was gener - ated but with the central Ser2 residue acetylated in order to pre - vent its phosphorylation . Again up to two phosphorylations were seen by analytical HPLC upon incubation with P - TEFb ( Fig . 4f ) . The same peptide stretch containing Ser5 acetylation but not Ser2 showed instead a majority of remaining unphosphorylated peptide , whereas only a minor fraction with one additional phosphorylation was detected ( Fig . 4g ) . These data suggest that P - TEFb preferentially phosphorylates Ser5 on a RNAPII CTD substrate , whereas a small ambiguity for Ser2 phosphorylation may remain . In a second set of experiments , the directionality of CTD phos - phorylation by P - TEFb was addressed . Using CTD substrate pep - tides of three hepta - repeats that contained only one Ser5 phos - phorylation at either end of the template ( Fig . 5a ) , we found that P - TEFb exhibited an almost fourfold higher catalytic activity for the substrate when the phosphorylation mark was placed at the C - terminus ( Fig . 5b , c ) . Such differences in the amino - or carboxy - terminal extension kinetics to pre - existing phosphorylation sites could indicate a preferred directionality of the enzyme during the phosphorylation reaction . Two regions in Hexim1 are required for P - TEFb inhibition . The cellular protein Hexim1 is an inhibitor of P - TEFb activity by an as yet unknown mechanism 2 . Using the in vitro kinase assay , we set out to determine the molecular requirements of P - TEFb inhibi - tion quantitatively . Under standard conditions , 0 . 1 µ M P - TEFb was mixed with 100 µ M GST – CTD [ 8 ] and 100 µ M ATP and incubated for 10 min before the solution was spotted onto filter paper and the reaction stopped by immersing the filter paper in phosphoric acid . Under these conditions full - length Hexim1 at a concentration of 2 . 5 µ M inhibited P - TEFb activity to 28 % without addition of 7SK snRNA . In contrast , 2 . 5 µ M of the 332 nucleotides encompassing 7SK showed no effect on P - TEFb , a result also obtained with the 66 - mer 5 ′ - hairpin finger that was previously identified to interact with Hexim1 ( ref . 26 ; Fig . 6a ) . The addition of a Hexim1 / 7SK snRNA complex instead inhibited P - TEFb activity almost completely ( 3 % ) , as did flavopiridol ( 2 % ) . These results confirm a role of 7SK snRNA as a scaffold for Hexim1 - mediated P - TEFb inhibition . We next fragmented Hexim1 in the C - terminal Cyclin TBD ( residues 255 – 359 ) and the remaining regulatory segment 1 – 254 . Interestingly , neither fragment inhibited P - TEFb activity ( Fig . 6b ) , although the TBD was shown before to interact with CycT1 at a site required in the Cdk2 – CycA complex for substrate recognition 27 . Further N - terminal elongations of the TBD revealed a marked increase in the inhibitory potential of a construct starting at posi - tion 194 compared with position 207 , suggesting that residues 194 – 206 are necessary for the inhibitory function of Hexim1 ( Fig . 6b ) . Point mutations identified a PYNT motif at position 202 as the inhibitory region of Hexim1 , in accordance with previous studies in vivo 28 . The largest effect , however , was not contributed by Y203 , as suggested in analogy to Cdk2 - CycA inhibition by p27 Kip , but by T205 , whose mutation to glycine almost fully abrogated the inhibi - tory potential of Hexim1 ( 88 % relative activity , Fig . 6c ) . The homo - geneity of the various Hexim1 mutant proteins tested is shown in Supplementary Fig . S7 . The inhibitory effect of N - terminally truncated Hexim1 200 – 359 was indeed as potent as full - length Hexim1 bound to 7SK snRNA , supporting previous observations that the N - terminal part of Hexim1 could be self - inhibitory 29 . At concentrations of 100 nM P - TEFb , half - maximal inhibitory concentration ( IC 50 ) values of 67 nM for Hexim1 200 – 359 and 67 nM for Hexim1 / 7SK , respec - tively , were determined compared with an IC 50 of 339 nM for full - length Hexim1 ( Fig . 6d ) . In binding experiments using isothermal titration calorimetry ( ITC ) , the T205G mutation reduced the affinity of Hexim1 for P - TEFb about sevenfold to the portion of the Hexim1 TBD – CycT1 interaction ( Table 1 ) . These results sup - port the synergistic contribution of the central PYNT motif in Hexim1 to the C - terminal TBD , which are required for Cdk9 kinase inhibition and CycT1 binding ( Fig . 6e and Table 1 ) . HIV - 1 Tat / TAR does not change P - TEFb phosphorylations . Addi - tion of either HIV - 1 Tat or the HIV - 1 Tat / TAR ribonucleoprotein complex in increasing amounts to P - TEFb / Hexim1 led to recovery of the kinase activity in the substrate activity assay ( Fig . 7a ) . This effect is supposed to occur by displacement of Hexim1 from its bind - ing site on CycT1 , as no ternary complex between these two P - TEFb regulating proteins with CycT1 is formed 30 , 31 . An indication for a change or weakening of the P - TEFb substrate specificity towards both Ser2 and Ser5 phosphorylation 32 , 33 , for example , by means of increasing numbers of phosphorylation , was not observed . Addi - tion of Tat or Tat / TAR led to an approximately twofold higher activ - ity of P - TEFb to a consensus CTD substrate , though the number of phosphorylations remained unchanged ( Fig . 7b and Supplementary Figs S5 and S8 ) . This result was confirmed on the full - length CTD where the viral protein – RNA complex did not induce a super - shift in the migration pattern of the phosphorylated substrate ( Fig . 7c ) . The substrate specificity of P - TEFb when bound to Tat remained unaltered compared with P - TEFb alone . First , western blot analysis revealed the same prevalence of P - TEFb – Tat for Ser5 phosphoryla - tion as seen with P - TEFb alone ( Fig . 7d and Supplementary Fig . S9 ) . Likewise , using the synthesized CTD peptide library in a radioac - tive kinase assay , we found that the P - TEFb – Tat complex showed again a higher activity for a CTD substrate pre - phosphorylated at Ser7 compared with the consensus CTD sequence , whereas Ser2 or Ser5 pre - phosphorylations abrogated their recognition as potential substrate ( Fig . 7e ) . After 15 min incubation , phosphorylation num - bers were always increased in the presence of Tat , whereas control measurements confirmed that Tat did not act itself as a substrate . The moderate increase in P - TEFb activity could result , for example , from advanced ionic interactions of basic residues in Tat with the negatively charged substrate . In addition , the effect of Tat mutants that were described to specifically influence Tat functions 34 were analysed for their ability to recover P - TEFb activity from inhibition by Hexim1 ( Fig . 7f ) . As before , addition of TAR RNA increased the effect of Tat on P - TEFb activation , but this effect was lost when the arginine - rich motif in Tat that mediates TAR binding was mutated cons .

Mutation of cysteine residues in Tat that form two dis - tinct zinc - fingers , one including an intermolecular zinc - finger with CycT1 , diminished the stimulatory function of Tat . Likewise , an N - terminal truncation that largely omits the Tat transactivation domain almost fully abrogated Tat function . In the latter two exper - iments , addition of TAR even weakened the Tat effect , potentially due to the capturing of Tat from P - TEFb . Finally , we investigated the effect of human AFF4 on the activity of P - TEFb . AFF4 is a subunit of the super elongation complex that is recruited by mixed lineage leukaemia ( MLL ) proteins to activate the expression of MLL target genes 35 – 38 . The N - terminal 300 amino acids of AFF4 were shown to specifically interact with P - TEFb 39 , 40 . Again , the substrate specificity was tested for the consensus CTD [ 3 ] as well as serine pre - phosphorylated peptides and K7 - CTD [ 3 ] . Overall , the phosphorylation profile appeared similar as for HIV - 1 Tat with a considerable stimulatory effect of P - TEFb – AFF4 for the consensus CTD ( Supplementary Fig . S10 ) . These results suggest similar molecular mechanisms for the stimulation of gene expression for the leukaemia - associated MLL proteins as for the viral Tat – TAR transactivation complex . Discussion Since the identification of Cdk12 / Cdk13 as the human orthologues of yeast Ctk1 , there has been considerable debate about the sub - strate specificity of RNAPII transcription regulating kinases 41 , 42 . Here we show by analytical means and western blot analysis that P - TEFb ( Cdk9 ) specifically phosphorylates Ser5 of the hepta - repeat containing CTD . Although pre - phosphorylations of Ser7 even stimulate the catalytic activity of P - TEFb for CTD phosphorylation in the same hepta - repeat , Ser5 and Ser2 phosphorylations abrogate such double modifications . Instead , our data suggest that Ser5 and Ser2 phosphorylation of the CTD are two distinct events that are either spatially or temporally separated . Cyclin - dependent kinases Cdk1 and Cdk2 typically phospho - rylate substrates of the consensus type ( S / T ) Px ( K / R ) 22 , 23 . In this motif , the amino group of the lysine residue at position + 3 is involved in ionic interactions with the phospho - threonine moiety within the T - loop activation segment of the kinase 22 . Following this recognition principle , phosphorylation of Ser5 by P - TEFb assigns Tyr1 a central role in the S 5 PSY 1 sequence motif . The aromatic tyro - sine is indeed the most peculiar moiety in the hepta - repeats of oth - erwise low sequence complexity containing another three serines , two prolines and one threonine each . The tyrosine may thus account for the kinase – substrate specificity seen here for P - TEFb that secures exactly one phosphorylation per CTD repeat . The position + 2 in this connotation , which can be serine , phospho - serine or lysine , instead seems less decisive but a negative charge appears to be beneficial . The stimulatory effect of Ser7 pre - phosphorylation for priming of the CTD as P - TEFb substrate gets even more accentuated as all other phospho - modifications ascribed to the CTD ( pTyr1 , pSer2 , A5 A5 A5 2 , 500 2 , 600 2 , 700 2 , 800 2 , 900 3 , 000 Mass ( Da ) 2 , 672 . 4 S2A0h 2 , 500 2 , 600 2 , 700 2 , 800 2 , 900 3 , 000 Mass ( Da ) S2A5h 2 , 911 . 8 2 , 832 . 1 2 , 752 . 3 2 , 672 . 4 + 1P + 2P + 3P 0P S5A0h S5A5h 2 , 500 2 , 600 2 , 700 2 , 800 2 , 900 3 , 000 Mass ( Da ) 2 , 500 2 , 600 2 , 700 2 , 800 2 , 900 3 , 000 Mass ( Da ) 0P 2 , 665 . 1 2 , 585 . 5 + 1P 0P 2 , 585 . 2 A2 A2 A2 5 5 5 + P - TEFb 2 2 2 A5 A5 A5 + P - TEFb 0P A2 A2 A2 S S S YAPT PSYAPT PSYAPT PS M W = 2 , 673 Da S2A - CTD [ 3 ] RR S S S YSPTAP YSPTAP YSPTAP M W = 2 , 686 Da S5A - CTD [ 3 ] Y RR YSPTSPSYSPTSPSYSPTSPS M W = 2 , 634 Da cons .

Phosphorylation of Ser2 in the context of a pSer5 mark making an S 2 PTpS 5 recognition motif could indeed be challenging for any cyclin - dependent kinase as the presence of a double nega - tively charged phospho - serine at a position where typically a basic lysine or arginine resides may lead to electrostatic repulsion .

The combinations of various phosphorylations in either one or two neighbouring hepta - repeats create the possibility for an additional layer of recognition specificity to mediate transcriptional regulation . Most simply , regions of Ser5 and Ser2 phosphorylation are spatially separated on the CTD , creating thus functional islands . Alternatively , stringent Ser5 dephosphorylation by phosphatases such as Rtr1 or Fcp1 in yeast 43 , 44 is required in order to render Ser2 phosphoryla - tion possible . A recent study has indeed identified that the human RPAP2 phosphatase specifically recognizes Ser7 phosphorylation marks on the CTD to facilitate Ser5 dephosphorylation 45 . In a simi - lar line of argument , a universal RNAPII CTD cycle along genes has been proposed , which is orchestrated by complex interplays between kinases , phosphatases and proline isomerases 46 . The determination of the minimal distances required between the two general phospho - rylation marks Ser5 and Ser2 and their possible combinations with other modifications such as pSer7 might therefore be a key step in the understanding of CTD interacting proteins that recognize differ - ent phospho - isoforms during the transcription cycle 47 – 50 .

Kinetic measurements with partially phosphorylated CTD substrates revealed a higher activity of P - TEFb for N - terminal progression on the periodic template compared with C - terminal progression . This might suggest a consecutive mechanistic behav - iour of the enzyme with respect to pre - existing Ser5 phosphoryla - tions . Interestingly , it was shown that an acidic motif following the last hepta - repeat of the 52 human repeats is important for its stabil - ity 51 . The ten C - terminal residues , ISPDDSDEEN , of human Rpb1 could in fact resemble an additional repeat pre - phosphorylated at positions Ser5 or Ser7 that might initiate modification of the preceding repeat . From inhibition and activation experiments performed with Hexim1 and HIV - 1 Tat , respectively , we found no contributions of CycT1 to the P - TEFb - specific CTD substrate recognition . This result differs from studies of budding yeast cyclins 52 or the Cdk2 / CycA complex and the substrate recognition site on CycA , which was identified to interact with the RxL motif of the substrate Cdc6 about 20 residues downstream of the phosphorylation site 22 . The corresponding surface patch on the first cyclin box repeat of CycT1 is covered both by P - TEFb - activating factors , such as Tat 33 , 53 , and by inhibitory factors , such as Hexim 30 , 31 , which do not directly con - tribute to substrate binding as shown here . However , co - factors of P - TEFb as shown for AFF4 of the super elongation complex could stimulate its catalytic activity or might potentially even change its substrate recognition profile . Likewise , spatial constraints in the transcription active complex could induce a processive phosphor - ylation mechanism , leading to continuous modification pattern on the CTD hepta - repeats . It is suggested that different combinations of Ser2 , Ser5 and Ser7 phosphorylations as well as proline isomerization constitute a ‘CTD code’ , which orchestrates transcription with pre - mRNA processing , histone modification and spliceosomal subunit arrangements 3 – 6 , 54 . The unexpected finding that P - TEFb is a Ser5 CTD kinase with a preference for Ser7 pre - phosphorylations to generate Ser5 / Ser7 double - phosphorylation marks requires further structural and functional investigations on the multifaceted CTD phosphorylation patterns and their corresponding recognitions . These findings are reminiscent to observations in fission yeast where initial phospho - rylation of the CTD by the kinase Mcs6 of TFIIH stimulates sub - sequent phosphorylation by P - TEFb , possibly to couple elongation and capping of select pre - mRNAs 55 . Likewise , the cyclin - dependent kinase Bur1 / Bur2 , which is the budding yeast orthologue of human Cdk9 , was shown to directly stimulate Ser5 and indirectly Ser2 phosphorylation by Ctk1 during transcriptional elongation 56 . Other CTD - modifying enzymes , such as the two recently identified Cdk12 and Cdk13 kinases 41 , 42 , may additionally contribute to the variety and spatial or temporal preferences of CTD phosphorylations . The high susceptibility of Cdk9 / P - TEFb for negatively charged sub - strates demonstrated in continuous phosphorylation imprints of every single CTD hepta - repeat , is indeed remarkable and might be a unique property of CTD - modifying kinases that are involved in the regulation of transcription . Methods Cloning of expression plasmids and protein production . The coding gene for full - length Cdk9 ( 1 – 372 ) was cloned into pFastBac HTb ( Invitrogen ) using Nco I / Eco RI restriction sites . The bacmid for transfection of Sf 21 insect cells was obtained using the Bac - to - Bac expression system following the manufacturer’s instructions ( Invitrogen ) . His - Cdk9 was expressed in Sf 21 cells for 3 days at 27 °C by infecting cells with a third amplification Cdk9 baculovirus at 1 : 30 to 1 : 50 ratios . CycT1 ( 1 – 272 ) was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 ( DE3 ) cells as described previ - ously 57 . The heterodimeric P - TEFb complex was reconstituted by addition of purified CycT1 to the resuspended Cdk9 cells . The complex was purified using a Ni - NTA column followed by gel filtration on a Superdex 200 ( 16 / 60 ) column at 4 °C . Pure protein was concentrated , aliquoted and flash - frozen in liquid nitrogen .

Proteins were expressed in E . coli BL21 ( DE3 ) cells after addition of 0 . 1 mM isopropyl - β - D - thiogalactoside . Expression was carried out for 3 – 4 h at 30 °C or for 16 h at 20 °C . Proteins were purified using Ni - NTA or glutathione - affinity chromatography and size exclusion chromatography .

Full - length Cdk9 and Cyclin T1 were purchased from ProQinase ( Freiburg ) at a concentration of 0 . 168 µ g µ l − 1 . Similarly , Cdk7 was purchased from ProQi - nase as a trimeric complex containing Cdk7 / CycH / MAT1 at a concentration of 0 . 139 µ g µ l − 1 . RNAPII CTD proteins . Plasmids containing 5 , 9 or 13 CTD hepta - repeats were cloned from a synthetic oligonucleotide template as GST fusion proteins into a pGEX - 4T1 TEV expression vector . A CTD sequence containing lysine at position 7 throughout was cloned following a similar strategy . GST – CTDs , designated as GST – CTD [ 9 ] or GST – CTD [ 13 ] according to the number of hepta - repeats , were expressed in BL21 ( DE3 ) or BL21 codon plus RP cells after induction with 0 . 1 mM isopropyl - β - d - thiogalactoside for 16 h at 20 °C . Protein purification was performed using GSH - affinity chromatography and subsequent size exclusion chromatogra - phy . In addition , a GST – CTD [ 8 ] construct was cloned with the N - and C - terminal three residues of the CTD [ 9 ] template mutated to lysines .

( a ) The kinase activity of 0 . 1 µ m P - TEFb using GsT – CTD [ 8 ] substrate and radioactive - labelled ATP co - substrate was measured after 10 min incubation ( left column ) . Inhibition of P - TEFb activity by Hexim1 200 – 359 led to a reduction of kinase activity to 6 % ( second column ) . Addition of either HIV - 1 Tat or the preformed HIV - 1 Tat / TAR complex in increasing concentrations recovered P - TEFb activity ( central columns ) . As controls , substrate plus ATP without P - TEFb or with P - TEFb with flavopiridol were measured ( right columns ) . ( b ) Kinetics of Tat / TAR - stimulated P - TEFb activity in the absence of Hexim1 . Full - length GsT – CTD [ 52 ] at 2 . 5 µ m concentration was incubated with 2 mm ATP and 0 . 2 µ m P - TEFb . HIV - 1 Tat 1 – 86 or Tat / TAR was added before the reaction at concentrations of 2 µ m . The specific activities K cat / K m were determined to 4 . 7×10 3 m − 1 s − 1 for P - TEFb , 8 . 8×10 3 m − 1 s − 1 for P - TEFb – Tat , and 9 . 6×10 3 m − 1 s − 1 for P - TEFb with Tat / TAR . ( c ) sDs – PAGE analysis of P - TEFb phosphorylated full - length CTD in the presence or absence of Tat or Tat / TAR showed no increase in the migration pattern . ( d ) Western blot analysis of P - TEFb – Tat - mediated CTD phosphorylation revealed prevalence for ser5 phosphorylation . ( e ) The substrate specificity of P - TEFb on synthesized CTD peptides remained unchanged in the presence of HIV - 1 Tat . The phosphorylation efficacy was monitored after 15 min . ( f ) Effects of Tat mutations on the recovery of P - TEFb activity in the presence of Hexim1 . To a concentration of 0 . 1 µ m P - TEFb , 100 µ m GsT – CTD and 1 mm ATP , a concentration of 1 . 5 µ m Hexim1 was added for inhibition and 15 µ m Tat or Tat / TAR for activation . Disruption of the intermolecular zinc - finger formation by mutation C22A / C37A or n - terminal truncation 35 – 86 significantly reduced the ability of Tat to activate P - TEFb . Data shown in a , b , e and f are the mean ± s . d . from three independent experiments .

Peptide samples were loaded onto the column at 5 % buffer B and eluted with a gradient from 5 – 80 % buffer B . Data evaluation was performed with the Xcalibur , MagTran and Bioworks software packages . Isothermal titration calorimetry . Thermodynamic parameters of the Hexim – P - TEFb and the Hexim – CycT1 interactions were determined by ITC using either an iTC 200 or VP - ITC calorimeter ( MicroCal ) . P - TEFb and CycT1 proteins were thermostated in the measurement cell and titrated with approximately tenfold higher concentrated Hexim proteins . Measurements with P - TEFb were carried out in two different buffers with buffer A containing 50 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 6 , 500 mM NaCl , 10 % ( v / v ) glycerol , 5 mM β - mercaptoethanol ( high salt buffer ) and buffer B containing 50 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 6 , 250 mM NaCl , 5 % ( v / v ) glycerol , 5 mM β - mercaptoethanol ( low salt buffer ) . The change in heating power was observed until equilibrium was reached before the next injection was started . The data were evaluated using the manufacturer’s analysis software . Western blot analysis . For western blot analysis , 10 µ M of human full - length GST – CTD was incubated at 30 °C with 0 . 04 µ M P - TEFb in presence or absence of 0 . 4 µ M Tat . Reactions were started by addition of 3 mM ATP and stopped at indicated time points by adding SDS - loading buffer to the reaction . For Coomas - sie staining , 1 µ g of GST – CTD from the reaction mix was loaded per lane on 12 % SDS – PAGE gel . For western blot analysis , 0 . 1 µ g of GST – CTD from the reaction mix was loaded per lane on 12 % SDS – PAGE gel , transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane ( Whatman ) and processed further by standard western - blotting protocols . For these assays , a 1 : 50 ( α - pSer2 ) , 1 : 1 , 000 ( α - pSer5 ) or 1 : 200 ( α - pSer7 ) dilution of primary rat IgG and 1 : 10 , 000 dilution of secondary HRP anti - rat IgG ( Santa Cruz , sc - 2964 ) antibodies were used . The anti - phospho - CTD antibodies were a kind gift from Dirk Eick , Munich . Quantitative determination of P - TEFb activity by HPLC analysis . For deter - mination of P - TEFb - mediated substrate modifications , 13 - mer CTD substrate peptides were designed with either Ser2 or Ser5 residues at its centre . CTD substrate peptides were incubated at 0 . 25 mM concentration for 5 h at 30 °C with 0 . 2 µ M P - TEFb in presence of 3 mM ATP . Reactions were analysed by HPLC on a Prontosil ( Bischoff Chromatography ) 120 - 5 - C18 column ( 250×4 . 6 mm 2 ) using a Beckman Coulter System Gold consisting of a 126 Solvent Module and a 168 Detector set at a wavelength of 214 nm . Peptide samples were applied at a flow rate of 1 ml min − 1 at 5 % buffer B ( CH 3 CN with 0 . 08 % TFA ) in buffer A ( H 2 O plus 0 . 1 % TFA ) and eluted in a 15 min linear gradient from 5 – 45 % buffer B .
