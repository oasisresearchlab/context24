Charged with overseeing and advising managers , it can effectively reduce agency costs that arise from the separation of ownership and control . Several authors have argued that independent directors , with no ties to the com - pany other than their directorship , are better suited to perform this role as they can credibly limit managerial discretion and are thus more likely to produce decisions that are consistent with shareholder - wealth maximization . ( e . g . Fama and Jensen , 1983 ; Williamson , 1983 ) . Such limited managerial discretion , however , may have unintended effects on cor - porate innovation . A manager with limited discretion may be reluctant to engage in ex - ploratory projects , since the value of those projects depends on the ﬂexibility to adapt after observing outcomes . Friendly boards , whose interests are aligned with the man - ager , guarantee managerial discretion and may be more effective in motivating explo - ration and innovation . We develop a simple two - period model to illustrate this phenomenon . Sharehold - ers hire a manager and appoint a board to supervise the manager . In each period , the manager may propose to exploit a conventional business strategy or to explore an inno - vative business strategy . To implement the strategy , the manager needs approval from the board . We show that an independent board , who does not necessarily agree with the man - ager , makes exploration less attractive to the manager since it prevents the manager from adapting strategies after observed outcomes . An independent board is thus effec - tive when the goal is to motivate the manager to pursue conventional strategies . Friendly boards , on the other hand , always approve managerial strategies . This managerial discretion encourages the manager to explore , since being able to freely adapt to observed outcomes allows the manager to take full advantage of exploration . A friendly board is effective when the goal is to motivate the manager to pursue more exploratory strategies . Evidence for the model comes from observing search and hiring strategies for ﬁrms that were forced by regulatory changes to adopt more independent boards . Starting in 1999 , stock exchanges and the Sarbanes - Oxley Act ( SOX ) required ﬁrms to have a ma - jority of independent directors ( for similar approaches , see Linck et al . 2009 ; Dunchin et al . 2010 ) . Comparing ﬁrms that changed from less to more independent boards against ﬁrms that already had independent boards , we ﬁnd increased output - but less explo - ration . Firms whose boards become more independent patent more and receive more citations to their patents , however , this effect is mediated by an increase in claims and 1 is insigniﬁcant for uncited and highly cited patents . Firms whose boards become more independent also work in older technologies , more crowded , and more familiar tech - nologies . Their inventive work force also becomes older and more insular . The model and results imply a more nuanced relationship between oversight and search ; greater oversight appears to lead to greater effort and output , but less innovative exploration . 2 Related Literature Most previous research argues that limiting managerial discretion is effective in reduc - ing agency problems . There are a few exceptions . Aghion and Tirole ( 1997 ) and Burkart , Gromb , and Panunzi ( 1997 ) argue that allowing managerial discretion may enhance ini - tiative . In their model , managers are willing to exert more effort to become informed if they know that they will have effective control . Adams and Ferreira ( 2007 ) argue that managerial discretion encourages the manager to share information with the board , improving the advisory role of the board . The above papers discuss different ways to allow managerial discretion , such as dispersed shareholder ownership or a friendly board of directors . We provide an alternative role for managerial discretion based on the nature of the search and innovation process . In contrast to conventional projects , innovation is the result of experimentation with new ideas ( Schumpeter , 1934 ; Arrow , 1969 ; Weitzman , 1979 ) . The central tension that arises with experimentation is the one between “exploita - tion” and “exploration . ” Managerial discretion allows the manager to change course depending on outcomes , which is essential to fully capture the value of exploration . In a setting where innovation arises from experimentation , Manso ( 2011 ) ﬁnds that optimal incentive schemes that motivate exploration exhibit substantial tolerance or even reward for early failure and reward for long - term success . Moreover , job secu - rity and timely feedback on performance are essential to motivate exploration . While Manso ( 2011 ) studies optimal compensation , termination , and feedback policies , the current paper studies the optimal allocation of control between the principal and the agent . A large literature studies the role and inﬂuence of board characteristics ( for an overview see Adams , Hermalin , and Weisbach , 2010 ; for the economic relevance of boards see Ahern and Dittmar , 2012 ) . Much of the literature focuses on the role of independent board members ( most recently e . g . Masulis and Mobbs , 2014 ; Brochet and Srinivasan , 2014 ) . Several studies have analyzed how independent directors in - ﬂuence CEO compensation ( e . g . Faleye , Hoitash , and Hoitash 2011 ; Coles , Daniel , and Naveen , 2008 ; Denis and Sarin , 1999 ; Core , Holthausen and Larcker , 1999 ) , CEO ap - pointments and dismissals ( Knyazeva , Knyazeva , and Masulis , 2013 ; Guo and Ma - 2 sulis , 2011 ; Borokhovich , Parrino , and Trapani , 1996 ; Weisbach , 1988 ) , adoption of an - titakeover defenses ( Brickley , Coles , and Terry , 1994 ) or takeover premiums ( Cotter , Shivdasani , and Zenner , 1997 ; Byrd and Hickman , 1992 ) . From these studies the picture emerges that independent board members increase board oversight . Whether such in - tensiﬁed board monitoring is beneﬁcial or detrimental to shareholder wealth is much harder to answer though , and the correct answer seems to depend on the complex - ity of a ﬁrm’s operations ( Faleye , Hoitash , and Hoitash , 2011 ; Duchin , Matsusaka , and Oguzhan , 2010 ; Nguyen and Nielsen , 2010 ) . Several recent papers empirically study how corporate governance affects innova - tion , looking at determinants such as managerial compensation ( Ederer and Manso , 2013 ; Baranchuk , Kieschnick , and Moussawi , 2014 ) , ﬁrm’s going public decision ( Bern - stein , 2012 ) , private equity / venture capital involvement ( Lerner , Sorensen , and Stromberg , 2011 ; Tian and Wang , 2014 ; Chemmanur , Loutskina , and Tian , 2014 ) , anti - takeover pro - visions ( Atanassov , 2013 ; Chemmanur and Tian , 2014 ) , institutional ownership ( Aghion , Van Reenen , and Zingales , 2013 ) , ﬁnancial market development ( Hsu , Tian , and Xu , 2014 ) , conglomerate structure ( Seru , 2014 ) , analyst coverage ( He and Tian , 2013 ) , and stock market liquidity ( Fang , Tian , and Tice , 2013 ) . Almost all of this literature uses patent data to test their models . Raw patent counts are usually supplemented by the number of citations that a patent receives , as this measure correlates with ﬁnancial and technical value ( Harhoff 1999 ; Hall et al . , 2005 ) . Though less common , measures of originality and generality ( Hall , Jaffe , and Trajten - berg 2001 ) have been used to measure breadth and impact of innovations , ( see Lerner , Sorensen , and Stromberg , 2011 and Hsu , Tian , and Xu , 2014 ) . Most similar to the current study , Faleye , Hoitash , and Hoitash ( 2011 ) ﬁnd that mon - itoring intensity , as proxied by independent director presence on boards and commit - tees , correlates negatively with citation weighted patent counts . Kang et al . ( 2014 ) ﬁnd a positive correlation of social connections and assumedly " friendly " boards on the same measure . Using a sample of German ﬁrms , Balsmeier , Buchwald , and Stiebale ( 2014 ) show that executives serving as directors on other ﬁrms’ supervisory boards are posi - tively correlated with the monitored ﬁrms’ patenting activities , as long their home ﬁrm is innovative itself . Executives from non - innovative ﬁrms are negatively related to the monitored ﬁrms’ patenting activity . The current study reﬁnes these results with more nuanced measures and an inves - tigation of the full distribution of citations . Using logit and quantile regression models , we show that independent boards have a positive correlation in the middle of the distri - bution but no signiﬁcant inﬂuence in the tails . We use the rate of prior and self citation , along with Jaffe’s ( 1986 ) measure of technological proximity , and the age of citation , to demonstrate decreased search . We also present novel measures , based on disambigua - 3 tion of the inventor database ( Li et al . 2014 ) , to show that ﬁrms whose boards become more independent are less likely to hire younger and new to the ﬁrm inventors . 3 The Model Shareholders hire a manager to run a ﬁrm for two periods . To supervise the manager , shareholders appoint a board of directors . In each period , the manager reports to the board of directors , proposing a strategy , which the board decides whether or not to approve . Firm output in each period is either S ( “success” ) or F ( “failure” ) . The manager can always propose a conventional business strategy , which has a known probability p of success . At the beginning of the ﬁrst period , the manager ﬁnds out whether a new business strategy is available , in which case he may propose it to the board in place of the conventional strategy . The new strategy has an unknown probability q of success , which may be either q L or q H , with q H > q L . Manager , board of directors , and shareholders may disagree about the distribution of q . They believe that q is equal to q H with probability µ M , µ B , and µ S respectively . The only way for them to learn about q is if the ﬁrm explores the new strategy . All agents are risk - neutral and have a discount factor of one . They own shares in the ﬁrm , and thus maximize at each point in time the present value of the ﬁrm’s future output . We ﬁrst consider the case of a friendly board , whose beliefs are aligned with the manager’s beliefs ( µ B = µ M ) . In this case , the problem turns into a standard bandit problem , since the manager and board have the same interest and beliefs , and thus act as if they were a single agent . Proposition 1 Under a friendly board , the ﬁrm explores the new strategy if and only if µ M ≥ ( 1 + q L ) ( p − q L ) ( 1 + q L + q H − p ) ( q H − q L ) ( 1 ) Proposition 1 shows that the ﬁrm engages in exploration if and only if the manager is sufﬁciently optimistic about the prospect of the new business strategy . Now we consider the case of an independent board . In this case , the manager needs to consider the reaction of the board in deciding whether to propose a new business strategy . 4 Proposition 2 Under an independent board , the ﬁrm explores the new strategy if and only if µ M ≥ p − q L q H − q L and µ B ≥ ( 1 + q L ) ( p − q L ) ( 1 + q L + q H − p ) ( q H − q L ) ( 2 ) or ( 1 + q L ) ( p − q L ) ( 1 + q L + q H − p ) ( q H − q L ) ≤ µ M ≤ p − q L q H − q L and ( 1 + q L ) ( p − q L ) ( 1 + q L + q H − p ) ( q H − q L ) ≤ µ B ≤ p − q L q H − q L ( 3 ) or The manager will only propose a new business strategy if the board is optimistic enough to approve it . However , if the board is too optimistic about the new strategy , the manager may not propose it , since the board could compel the manager to stick with the strategy even after failure . In sum , the loss of control over future strategies of the ﬁrm imposed by an independent board makes a manager less likely to explore new business strategies . Figure 1 shows the parameter regions in which the ﬁrm engages in exploration un - der different board structures . The shaded are represents the parameter region in which the ﬁrm engages in exploration under a friendly board . The dotted area represents the parameter region in which the ﬁrm engages in exploration under an independent board . As the ﬁgure illustrates , there is more exploration under a friendly board than under an independent board . For most of the empirical analysis we will be studying how changes in board type induce exploration / exploitation . Propositions 1 and 2 show that more independent ( friendly ) boards motivate more exploitation ( exploration ) . Another relevant question is which type of board should shareholders appoint . As Proposition 3 below shows , this will depend on whether the problem faced by share - holders is to motivate managers to be more or less innovative . Proposition 3 If the manager is optimistic relative to shareholders about innovation ( µ M > µ S ) , then shareholders will appoint an independent board with µ B = µ S to restrict exploration by the manager . Otherwise , if the manager is pessimistic relative to shareholders about innova - tion , then shareholders will appoint a friendly board ( µ B = µ M ) to motivate exploration by the manager . If the manager is more optimistic than shareholders about innovation , then share - holders need to restrict exploration by the manager , and thus will appoint an inde - pendent board . If the manager is more pessimistic than shareholders about innovation , 5 µ M µ B ( 1 + q L ) ( p − q L ) ( 1 + q L + q H − p ) ( q H − q L ) p − q L q H − q L ( 1 + q L ) ( p − q L ) ( 1 + q L + q H − p ) ( q H − q L ) p − q L q H − q L Figure 1 : Exploration region under different board structures . The shaded area represents the parameter region in which the ﬁrm engages in exploration under a friendly board . The dotted area represents the parameter region in which the ﬁrm engages in exploration under an independent board . then shareholders need to motivate the manager to explore more , and thus will appoint a friendly board . Throughout this section we assumed that board members and managers maximize ﬁrm value and investigated how shareholders should choose board composition to pro - vide incentives to the manager . Could shareholders do better if they offer a compensa - tion packages to motivate the manager ? It turns out that the optimal board composition derived in Proposition 3 achieves ﬁrst - best . Therefore , an incentive contract could at best be equivalent to optimal board composition , but would be more costly and thus dominated . To sum up , under an independent board , the manager loses control over the future strategies of the ﬁrm . This reduces the appeal of exploration , since exploration requires adaptability when implemented . A friendly board , on the other hand , allows discretion to managers and is thus effective in motivating exploration . Shareholders should ap - point an independent board when they need to restrict exploration by the manager and a friendly board when they need to motivate exploration by the manager . 6 4 Identiﬁcation strategy Identiﬁcation for our study relies upon regulatory changes that forced public ﬁrms to increase the presence of independent directors on their boards in the early 2000s . The effects of those regulatory changes on variables other than innovation have been ana - lyzed elsewhere ( see e . g . Linck et al . 2009 ; and Dunchin et al . , 2010 , for a setup that is most similar to ours ) . In this section , we brieﬂy describe the regulatory framework that is relevant to our analysis . Initiated by recommendations of the Blue Ribbon Committee ( BRC ) in 1999 , stock market rules of the NYSE and Nasdaq have been built upon the assumption that inde - pendent board members are better able to monitor managers . Subsequent to the BRC recommendations , the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) approved new cor - responding rules in December 1999 , requiring public ﬁrms to move to a fully inde - pendent audit committee with the next re - election or replacement of audit committee members . Further motivated by prominent corporate scandals , e . g . Enron , this rule was written into U . S . law in 2002 as a part of the Sarbanes - Oxley Act ( SOX ) . It was followed by subsequent NYSE and Nasdaq regulations in 2003 that imposed even stricter re - quirements on board composition . In addition to having an audit committee composed of merely independent directors , both stock exchanges forced ﬁrms to have a majority of independent directors as regular board members , and the compensation and nomi - nation committees had to consist of 100 % independent board members ( > 50 % if ﬁrms are listed on Nasdaq only ) . Deﬁnitions of director independence vary slightly across each rule . SOX states in section 301 that a given director is independent if the person does not “accept any con - sulting , advisory , or other compensatory fee from the issuer” ( except for serving the board ) , and is not an “afﬁliated person of the issuer or any subsidiary” ( NYSE speaks of “no material relationship” ; and Nasdaq requires no relationship that would interfere with “independent judgment” ) . The NYSE and Nasdaq regulations are strict . The inde - pendence assumption is already violated , for instance , if a director him - or herself or a direct family member was an employee of the ﬁrm during the previous three years , or a family member works for a third ﬁrm with which the given ﬁrm has a professional relationship , or a family member is connected to the ﬁrm’s auditor . These regulations made board changes necessary for a large group of ﬁrms . The number and fraction of independent board members was fairly stable until the year 2000 . With the described board regulations becoming effective , more and more inde - pendent directors were appointed to corporate boards . Figure 2 illustrates the changes in board composition and committees for the sample of ﬁrms used in our study . It re - sembles a pattern that has been documented in other studies for differing sets of public 7 Figure 2 50 60 70 80 90 100 % i ndependen t d i r e c t o r s / boa r d s 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 Year Independent directors on the board Independent boards Independent directors and boards Notes : This graph illustrates the evolution of independent boards over the sampling period . A board is deﬁned as independent if the majority of board members is classiﬁed as independent by the IRRC . Inde - pendent directors represents the average fraction of independent board members of all ﬁrms in the study . Details on sample construction and descriptive statistics are provided in section 5 . ﬁrms ( e . g . Linck et al . , 2008 , and Dunchin et al . , 2010 ) . A detailed description of the sam - ple composition is provided below ( section 4 ) . Board composition data are taken from the Investor Responsibility Research Center ( IRRC ) . From 1996 to 2006 the IRRC tracked individual board members of all major public U . S . ﬁrms and indicated in their database whether an individual board member is independent , an employee of the ﬁrm or other - wise afﬁliated ( former employee , employee of an organization that receives charitable gifts from the company , employee of a customer or supplier to the company , relative of an executive director , etc . ) . Reﬂecting the previously introduced regulatory changes , Figure 2 shows an increase of independent director presence on corporate boards and committees from 2001 to 2006 . Theoretical considerations about board control suggest that a crucial difference arise when a board switches from a minority to a majority of independent board mem - bers ( Harris and Raviv , 2008 ) . 1 It was further an explicit requirement of regulatory re - forms . Thus , our analysis focuses on this variable . Our data shows that the proportion 1 The fraction of independent board members provides more variation but has two major disadvan - tages . First , considering board voting behavior , it is likely that the inﬂuence of independent directors on board oversight does not linearly increase with the number or fraction of independent members but ex - hibits a jump when independent directors gain or lose the majority of votes . Second , the switch from a minority to a majority of independent directors was an explicit requirement of regulation , such that it is much more likely that observed changes in that regard happened involuntarily , which in turn improves the identiﬁcation of causal effects . 8 of ﬁrms with a majority of independent board members stayed rather stable around 68 % before 2000 and moved up to about 94 % by 2006 . Our empirical identiﬁcation of the relationship between board oversight and inno - vative ﬁrm activities stems from the difference between ﬁrms , who were already in compliance with the regulatory changes before 2001 ( results are robust to taking later years or 2000 as a threshold value ) , and those ﬁrms who switch to a majority of inde - pendent directors ( hereafter also referred to as an ‘independent board’ ) after regulatory changes became affective . Hence , all ﬁrms that were not required to change their board serve as a control group . In line with Dunchin et al . ( 2010 ) , we deﬁne ﬁrms as treated when they switch to an independent board after 2000 and have an audit committee that contains 100 % independent board members . The latter requirement helps to sort out potential voluntary switches , increasing the amount of truly exogenous increases of independent board members and making our main variable of interest less likely to be confounded by endogenous choice . The fraction of independent directors increased by 25 % during 2001 to 2006 by noncompliant ﬁrms and by 9 % with ﬁrms that fulﬁlled the regulatory requirements already before 2000 . 5 Data The dataset we built up for our study is determined by the joint availability of data on the composition of corporate boards and committees from the IRRC , basic ﬁrm level information on R & D investments and total assets from Compustat , and patent data from the NBER , the Fung Institute and the USPTO . The IRRC provides data on corpo - rate board members for 3000 major public U . S . based ﬁrms from 1996 to 2006 . Further data on the composition of corporate audit , compensation and nomination commit - tees is provided for the same set of ﬁrms from 1998 onwards . Compustat has further information on almost all of the ﬁrms covered by IRRC . A major challenge for the em - pirical researcher interested in those ﬁrms’ innovative activities is the identiﬁcation and compilation of the corresponding patent portfolios . Researchers involved in the NBER patent data project have spent signiﬁcant amounts of resources to identify patents that have been granted to U . S . based ﬁrms . The NBER patent database contains , however , only those patents that have been granted through 2006 . Due to the time lag with which inventions are granted property rights ( 1 - 5 years ) and the publication of corresponding data by the USPTO , this results in signiﬁcantly truncated patent application data for all years after 2001 . Researchers have found ways to use incomplete patent data for the years 2002 to 2006 , exploiting the distribution of applications before 2002 , but those ap - proaches are not suitable to describe real phenomena , add much noise to econometric analyses , and lead to signiﬁcant estimation errors in our case , because our sample of 9 board data covers 50 % of years for which the NBER data is severely truncated . The is - sue becomes even more prevalent if researchers want to take citations to patents into account that often occur several years after a patent has been granted . In terms of patent applications , the NBER data misses 18 percent of patent applications of U . S . based as - signees identiﬁed in 2002 , rising to 99 percent by 2006 . 2 Recently available disambiguations provide ( updated monthly , see Fierro et al . , 2014 ) detailed data for all patents granted by the USPTO . These data enable us to over - come the truncation of the NBER patent database and identify comprehensive patent portfolios of the ﬁrms in our sample up to the year 2007 . 3 While most analyses con - sider only granted patents , we assign patent to the year it was applied for , in order to more accurately assess the impact of that year’s variables . Since patent documents do not contain a unique identiﬁer of assignees , one of the major obstacles that had to be solved was the match of ﬁrm names that appear in our sample with ﬁrm names that appear in ambiguous forms on the patent documents . Matching ﬁrm names between databases thus requires signiﬁcant amounts of resources if done manually . The issue becomes obvious if one considers all patents that have been ﬁled by U . S . based pub - licly listed ﬁrms ( > 500k ) . Hence , analyzing innovations of a relatively small amount of ﬁrms , using recent patent data , can become a labor - intensive challenge , and the disam - biguation of assignee names as they appear on the patent documents alone will often not be sufﬁcient . For individual researchers the costs and the time needed for data col - lection , cleaning and preparation , quickly exceed available capacities . Moreover , after disambiguating the assignee names as they appear on the patent documents , it is often necessary to aggregate patent data at the ﬁrm level and merge those aggregated num - bers to other databases , like Compustat and IRRC . Given the high costs involved , most research that requires both large scale patent and ﬁrm level data still solely relies on the NBER patent database , restraining the analysis to periods ending latest in 2001 . We extended the reach of the NBER patent database by combining it with USPTO and Fung Institute data , including patent citations and other detailed information within each patent document . We started with standardized assignee names provided by the USPTO for all patents granted through December 31 , 2012 . These standardized assignee names are largely free of misspellings but still contain many name abbreviations for in - dividual ﬁrms . The crucial advantage of the standardized USPTO assignee names is that they are time invariant and have been used by the NBER patent project team to disambiguate ﬁrm names . For almost all ﬁrms that received at least one patent between 2 The numbers are derived by comparing all patent applications in the NBER database with all patents in the Fund Institutes database as published in April 2014 . 3 We gather patent data through 2007 , because we will estimate regressionsof ﬁrms’ patenting activities in year t on board data and controls in t - 1 , reﬂecting that patenting activities need some time to be inﬂu - enced by boards and simultaneous determination of variables may otherwise confound the estimation . 10 1975 and 2006 the NBER provides a unique time invariant assignee . We took all varia - tions of standardized assignee names that belong to a given single ﬁrm as a training set , and gave all granted patents that appear with the same standardized assignee name af - ter 2006 the same unique NBER identiﬁer . 4 These information enabled us to track ﬁrms’ patenting activity over signiﬁcantly longer time periods , overcoming truncation issues of patent applications and generally increasing the accuracy of available patent portfo - lios . Finally , we merged unique time invariant Compustat identiﬁers to the patent as - signee identiﬁers as they are provided by the NBER . It is worthwhile to note that in our analysis we take only those ﬁrms into account for which the NBER has identiﬁed Compustat matches , and we assigned zero patents only to those ﬁrms where the NBER team searched for but could not ﬁnd matches with any patent . In this regard we deviate from other studies that assign zero patents also to those ﬁrms that have not been tested to appear as a patent assignee or not . We avoid this measurement error at the expense of a smaller but more accurate dataset . In order to circumvent potential selection effects to confound our estimation of the relationship between board oversight and innovation , we further removed all ﬁrms that entered the sample in the year 2000 or later , such that the remaining ﬁrms can be observed over a timespan where the previously described regulatory changes took place . As we estimate ﬁrm ﬁxed effects models we further removed all ﬁrms that appear only once in the data . Finally , we arrive at a sample of 6676 observations on 932 ﬁrms observed during the period from 1996 to 2006 for which we could gather all information of interest . All ﬁrms in the sample combined have applied for 337 , 465 patents during the sample period . Table 1 presents summery statistics on the dataset . Descriptive analysis The patenting activities of the ﬁrms in our sample show the typ - ical skewness with a mean of ~ 51 patents and a median of 2 patents . Related mea - sures like the amount of R & D investment , citation - weighted patent counts and claim - weighted patent counts show similar distributions with and high concentration among the most active ﬁrms . We calculated the number of patents that cite a given patent based on all USPTO granted patents by April 2014 . The number of citations falls natu - rally from 1996 to more recent years . In our estimations we employ time ﬁxed effects to account for these differences across time that presumably concern all ﬁrms equally on average . 774 ﬁrms ( 80 % ) have applied for at least one patent during the sampling period . 5 4 Based on the ﬁrst assignee that appears on the patent document .

Board size is the number of board members . Independent board is an indicator variable that indicates whether the majority of board members are independent . Highly cited patents ( 1 % / 10 % ) are patents that fall into the 1 % / 10 % most cited patents within a given 3 - digit class and application year . Self - citations are the number of cites to patents held by the same ﬁrm . Av . age of self - cites is the average time in years between the year of application of each cited patent and the year of application of a given patent , aggregated at the ﬁrm level . Patents in new / old classes is the number of patents that are ﬁled in classes where the given ﬁrm has ﬁled no / at least one other patent beforehand . Technological proximity is the technological proximity between the patents ﬁled in year t to the existing patent portfolio held by the same ﬁrm up to year t - 1 , and is calculated according to Jaffe ( 1989 ) . Av . tenure of inventors is the average time in years since each inventor that appears on a patent ﬁled in year t ﬁrst appeared on another patent applied for by the same ﬁrm . Av . age of inventors is the average time in years since each inventor that appears on a patent ﬁled in year t ﬁrst appeared on the ﬁrst other patent since 1975 , irrespective of the speciﬁc assignee . The latter two variables are set to zero if a ﬁrm’s inventor does not previously appear in the database . Further information on variable deﬁnitions and data sources are provided in the text . 12 Figure 3 3 3 . 5 4 4 . 5 5 l og ( R & D ) 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 Year Treated firms Non - treated firms Av .

Patenting In order to reduce the skewness in R & D investments and patenting activities across ﬁrms we take the logarithm of those variables ( + 1 ) for most analyses . Figures 3 to 6 illustrate how the average amount of R & D investments , applied patents , cite - weighted patents and claim - weighted patents evolve over time . To reduce the inﬂuence of the varying proportion of non - patenting ﬁrms per year in the sample the graph is based on ﬁrms that that ﬁled at least one patent per year . We separate those ﬁrms that switch form a minority to a majority of independent directors on the board after 2000 , re - ferred to as ‘treated ﬁrms’ , and all other ‘non - treated ﬁrms’ . R & D investments rose almost constantly over the sampling period for all ﬁrms ( Figure 3 ) . The average num - ber patents and its cite - and claim - weighted counter parts show a gap between treated and non - treated ﬁrms up the year ~ 2001 that subsequently narrowed ( Figures 4 to 6 ) . The descriptive analysis thus points to potential positive effects of changes in board independence on patenting activity . 13 Figure 5 2 2 . 5 3 3 . 5 4 4 . 5 5 l og ( C i t e - w e i gh t ed pa t en t s ) 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 Year Treated firms Non - treated firms Av . cite - weighted patenting Figure 6 4 4 . 5 5 5 . 5 6 l og ( C l a i m - w e i gh t ed pa t en t s ) 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 Year Treated firms Non - treated firms Av . claim - weighted patents Notes : Figures3 to 6 illustrate how the average amount of R & D investments , granted patents , cite - weighted patents and claim - weighted patents , respectively , evolve over time . Firms that switch form a minority to a majority of independent directors on the board in 2001 or later are ‘treated ﬁrms’ , and all other ﬁrms considered as ‘non - treated ﬁrms’ . Details on sample construction and descriptive statistics are provided in section 3 . 14 In order to analyze the relationship between board oversight and patenting more systematically we estimate the following model : log ( patents it + 1 ) = β 0 + β 1 ∗ independent board i ∗ post t + β 2 ∗ board size it + β 3 ∗ log ( R & D ) it + β 4 ∗ log ( total assets ) it + δ t + α i + ǫ it where patents it + 1 is the number of patent grants of ﬁrm i in year t + 1 between 1996 and 2006 . In alternative regressions we will exchange the number of patent grants with sev - eral different variables that allow us to assess the ﬁrms’ innovative search and success in more detail . Our main explanatory variable of interest is a dummy that indicates whether a given ﬁrm has switched from a minority to a majority of independent board members in the year 2001 or later when regulatory changes became effective . Under the assumption that changes in patenting by ﬁrms that switched to majority of inde - pendent board members have been comparable to changes in patenting by other ﬁrms in the absence of a switch to an independent board β 1 captures the effect of increased board oversight through independent directors on patenting by the affected ﬁrms . 6 Three separate variables control for differences across ﬁrms and over time in patent - ing that are determined by board size , ﬁrm size and the investments in research and development ( R & D ) . 7 Board size measures the number of board members as we want to insulate the effect of board independence from potentially confounding contempo - rary changes in the number of directors . Further , we found that the ﬁrms in our sample differ signiﬁcantly in terms R & D spending and size , two variables that are naturally positively related to ﬁrms patenting activities . Firm ﬁxed effects α i control for any un - observed variation that is time invariant . Year ﬁxed effects further control for variation in the macroeconomic environment and patenting over time that affected all ﬁrms . 6 As can be seen in Figure 2 , not all ﬁrms switched from a friendly to an independent board at the same time , because directors were allowed to fulﬁll their contracts that were signed before the law change . In principal , this gives ﬁrms room for strategic choice that could confound our identiﬁcation . Therefore , we checked whether the time between the law change and compliance is correlated with pre - SOX innovative activity of the ﬁrms in our sample . In order to test this , we ﬁrst deﬁned a variable that measures the years until the board actually changed from friendly to independent although SOX and other regulations were already active ( 2003 ) . We found 17 ﬁrms with a one year lag , 14 with a two year lag and 8 with a three year lag . Then , we regressed time lag until compliance on ﬁrms’ average amount of R & D , patents , cites and claims before 2001 ( results are robust to taking 2000 or 2002 instead ) . As we did not ﬁnd any signiﬁcant correlation between compliance lags and pre - treatment innovative activity , we are conﬁdent that our estimation is not biased by systematic choice of more or less innovative ﬁrms to switch later or earlier . 7 All results presented below are robust to including different or additional control variables that have been employed by other studies , e . g . Galasso and Simcoe ( 2011 ) . 15 6 R & D , patents , cite - weighted patents , claim - weighted patents We will ﬁrst explore the impact of friendly boards on patent count and citations and then establish how friendly boards correlate with exploration . We ﬁrst estimate regres - sions of the logarithm of ﬁrms’ R & D investments , the number of patent grants applied for in that year , the number of cite - weighted grants and grants weighted by the num - ber of claims of each patent . With the ﬁrst model we want to assess potential changes in R & D investments after board oversight increases , which might be responsible for subsequent changes in patenting activities . 8 The latter two models address the concern that any effect on the number of patents might be only weakly related to the value of the inventions that those patents represent . Cite - weighted patent counts have been frequently used in the literature to assess the value of ﬁrms’ innovations , because pre - vious studies have shown that citations by other patents are positively correlated with ﬁrms’ value and patent renewals ( Harhoff 1999 ; and Hall et al . , 2005 ) . We also estimate a regression of claim - weighted patent counts . Inclusion of claims as control variable in the citation model indicates strong mediation by claims - it appears that independent boards correlate positively with the number of claims . Table 2 presents the correspond - ing results in columns a to e . Figures 7 to 10 illustrate the dynamic effect of a switch to an independent board on patenting graphically . For the graphs we deﬁned dummy variables for the speciﬁc times before and after ﬁrms changed to an independent board . t 0 deﬁnes the year of the switch , t n − 1 deﬁnes the number of years before the switch , and t n + 1 the corresponding years after the switch . Then , we ran regressions including these variables instead of the single dummy variable in the baseline model beforehand . As we still include year ﬁxed effects the coefﬁcients represent the relative change in patenting per year that is attributable to the board change . The results shown in Table 2 point out that an increase in board oversight through a change to an independent board is unrelated to the level of ﬁrms’ R & D investments . It is worthwhile to mention , however , that standard OLS regressions without ﬁrm ﬁxed effects indicate a decline in R & D investment that is statistically signiﬁcant at the 1 % level ( not presented ) . Tighter control by the board might have incentivized managers to spend more effort to show innovative success . 8 Alternative regressions with R & D investments scaled by total assets reveal similar results . 16 Table 2 - Patenting ( a ) ( b ) ( c ) ( d ) ( e ) R & D Patents Citations Citations Claims log ( no . claims ) 0 . 740 * * ( 0 . 011 ) log ( R & D ) 0 . 017 - 0 . 005 - 0 . 011 0 . 008 ( 0 . 031 ) ( 0 . 053 ) ( 0 . 039 ) ( 0 . 055 ) log ( Total assets ) 0 . 593 * * 0 . 238 * * 0 . 225 * * - 0 . 031 0 . 345 * * ( 0 . 042 ) ( 0 . 057 ) ( 0 . 086 ) ( 0 . 050 ) ( 0 . 094 ) Board size 0 . 010 0 . 022 0 . 004 - 0 . 002 0 . 008 ( 0 . 007 ) ( 0 . 013 ) ( 0 . 020 ) ( 0 . 011 ) ( 0 . 021 ) Independent board - 0 . 050 0 . 292 * * 0 . 661 * * 0 . 295 * * 0 . 495 * * ( 0 . 052 ) ( 0 . 079 ) ( 0 . 114 ) ( 0 . 075 ) ( 0 . 134 ) Year ﬁxed effects Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Firm ﬁxed effects Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Observations 6676 6676 6676 6676 6676 R 2 0 . 179 0 . 190 0 . 101 0 . 901 0 . 103 Notes : All explanatory variables are lagged by one period .

For the graphs we deﬁned dummy variables for the time ﬁrms changed from a minority of independent board members to an independent board . t 0 indicates the year of the switch and t n − 1 indicates the years before the switch , and t n + 1 the corresponding years after the switch . Coefﬁcients are taken from a regression as introduced in section 3 , but with the t n dummies instead of the one dummy variable indicating a majority of independent board members . Figure 9 is derived from regressions including the number of claims as an additional control variable . 7 Citations In this section , we exploit more detailed information contained in the citations that a patent receives ( forward citations ) . As we know that the patent citation as well as patent value distribution is highly skewed and the citation - value relationship is most likely not linear , we split the distribution into subcategories that intend to separate par - ticular successful , average patents and unsuccessful patents . Speciﬁcally , we consider 5 categories : ( 1 ) patents that received cites within the highest percentile ( top 1 % ) among all patents in the same 3 - digit patent class and application year , ( 2 ) patents that received cites within the highest centile ( 10 % ) among all patents in the same 3 - digit patent class and application year , ( 3 ) patents that received at least one citation ( median is 0 ) , ( 4 ) the average number of citations per patent , and ( 5 ) patents that received no citation . Ta - ble 3a presents the corresponding results . Table 3b presents all models as presented in Table 3a , but with additional control for the number of claims . In line with our previous patent regressions we see a positive effect of board over - sight on patenting . This is consistent with Kang et al . 2014 who show a marginally sig - niﬁcant and positive correlation between board independence and citation - weighted patenting , from a similar but earlier sample of ﬁrms . Interestingly , however , the esti - mated effect is by far the largest for patents that received exactly one citation , while the estimated effect on particular successful patents ( top 1 % or top 10 % ) is only about one 19 Table 3a - Differences in patenting ( a ) ( b ) ( c ) ( d ) ( e ) Top 1 % Top 10 % Cited Av . citations No cites log ( R & D ) 0 . 010 0 . 021 0 . 027 0 . 040 * 0 . 050 ( 0 . 007 ) ( 0 . 013 ) ( 0 . 025 ) ( 0 . 016 ) ( 0 . 036 ) log ( Total assets ) 0 . 042 * * 0 . 109 * * 0 . 211 * * 0 . 153 * * 0 . 206 * * ( 0 . 015 ) ( 0 . 031 ) ( 0 . 049 ) ( 0 . 035 ) ( 0 . 061 ) Board size 0 . 007 * 0 . 006 0 . 013 0 . 011 0 . 030 * ( 0 . 004 ) ( 0 . 006 ) ( 0 . 012 ) ( 0 . 007 ) ( 0 . 013 ) Independent board 0 . 054 * 0 . 077 0 . 357 * * 0 . 149 * * 0 . 121 ( 0 . 025 ) ( 0 . 039 ) ( 0 . 067 ) ( 0 . 042 ) ( 0 . 088 ) Year ﬁxed effects Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Firm ﬁxed effects Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Observations 6676 6676 6676 6676 6676 R 2 0 . 174 0 . 229 0 . 190 0 . 232 0 . 317 Notes : All explanatory variables are lagged by one period .

Taking also into account that the effect on the number of unsuccessful patents ( no cites ) is statistically insigniﬁcant and the effect on the average number of citations per patent is positive , it seems that ﬁrms focus more on moderately successful innovations . Table 3b includes claims as a mediating variable , in line with the hypothesis that independent boards would encourage measurable but less risky innovation . Board in - dependence now only correlates with patents that are cited at least once . Highly cited patents , patents without cites , and average citations are now insigniﬁcant , though their coefﬁcients remain positive . Figure 11 illustrates results for a quantile regression on the log of citations , including claims as a control variable . The horizontal dashed lines are the OLS estimates and 95 % conﬁdence band for comparison . The evidence is consistent with independent boards encouraging more exploitation and less exploration . 8 Self - citations , age of cites In this section , we run further regressions that aim to aid our understanding of the in - novative search that companies pursue and whether the balance between exploration and exploitation shifted with increased board oversight . First , we calculate the number 22 of citations that each patent makes to other patents . Increased backward citations could be interpreted as an indication for innovative search in relatively better - known and ma - ture technological areas . Second , we take the number of times a given patent cites other patents owned by the same company . More self - cites could indicate constraining search within previously known areas of expertise while fewer self - citations could indicate a broadening of innovative search or efforts to explore areas that are new to the ﬁrm . We supplement these regressions with a similar model on the average age of the backward citations . The age of a particular citation is calculated as the time in years between the application of the citing patent and the year of application of the cited patent . We av - erage those citation years over a given patent and then average over the whole patent portfolio of a given ﬁrm in a given year . Higher citation ages should indicate search in more mature technological areas , while citations to younger patents may indicate a switch to more recent technologies . Table 4 presents the corresponding results .

All results presented in Table 4 point out that ﬁrms with more independent boards tend to narrow their innovative search towards known and mature technological areas . 23 In the next section we provide complementary ﬁndings . 9 Classes and inventors We now look at the classes in which patents are ﬁled and the inventors employed by the ﬁrm . Speciﬁcally , we calculate the number of patents that are ﬁled in classes pre - viously unknown to the ﬁrm . Unknown patent classes are deﬁned as those in which a given ﬁrm has not applied for any patent beforehand . The counter part is the number of patents applied for in known classes . A more sophisticated measure of whether ﬁrms stay or deviate from known research areas is the technological proximity between the patents ﬁled in year t and the existing patent portfolio held by the same ﬁrm up to year t - 1 We calculate this measure according to Jaffe ( 1986 ) . It can formally be written as : P it = K ∑ k = 1 f ikt f ikt − 1 / K ∑ k = 1 f 2 ikt ∗ K ∑ k = 1 f 2 ikt − 1 ! 12 where f ikt is the fraction of ﬁrm i ’s patents that belong to patent class k at time t , and f ikt − 1 is the fraction of ﬁrm i ’s patent portfolio up to t - 1 that belongs to patent class k . P it ranges between 0 and 1 . The highest possible value indicates that the patents ﬁled in year t are distributed across patent classes in the exact same way as the portfolio of all patents of the same ﬁrm up to the previous year . Positive coefﬁcients in a regression would thus indicate a more narrow innovation trajectory within known areas . Moreover , we took advantage of the recent disambiguation of inventors mentioned on each patent document ( see Li et al . , 2014 ) . Knowing the inventors of each patent allows us to calculate whether ﬁrms are more likely to rely on their own , previously successful staff of inventors or whether ﬁrms rather hire new inventors or fund their younger colleagues . Therefore , we identiﬁed the ﬁrst time each inventor is mentioned on a patent document of the same ﬁrm , or in the whole patent database since 1975 , respectively . From there we calculated for each inventor the number of years between the ﬁrst appearance with the same ﬁrm ( in the patent database ) and the year of the given patent application . Inventors that appear for the ﬁrst time received 0 years . Then we averaged these years over a given patent and then over all patents applied for by a given ﬁrm in a given year . Table 5 presents the corresponding regression results . As can be seen , independent boards have an insigniﬁcant effect on exploration of new classes but a strong and sig - niﬁcantly positive effect on search in previously patented classes . These results are con - sistent with the Jaffe measure as well . Finally , ﬁrms with more independent boards are more likely to patent inventions by inventors employed longer by the ﬁrm and inven - 24 tors whose ﬁrst patent is older as well . 25 Table 5 - Classes and Inventors ( a ) ( b ) ( c ) ( d ) ( e ) New class Old class Tech . prox .

Board size is the number of board members . Independent board is a dummy that indicates ﬁrms that switched from a minority of independent board members to a majority of independent board members in 2001 or later . Patents in new / old classes is the number of patents that are ﬁled in classes where the given ﬁrm has ﬁled no / at least one other patent beforehand . Technological proximity is the technological proximity between the patents ﬁled in year t to the existing patent portfolio held by the same ﬁrm up to year t - 1 , and is calculated according to Jaffe ( 1986 ) . Av . tenure of inventors is the average time in years since each inventor that appears on a patent ﬁled in year t appeared on another patent applied for by the same ﬁrm the ﬁrst time . Av . age of inventors is the average time in years since each inventor that appears on a patent ﬁled in year t appeared on the ﬁrst other patent after 1975 , irrespective of the assignee . The latter two variables are set to zero if an inventor appears for the ﬁrst time in the patent database . Heteroskedasticity - robust standard errors that account for autocorrelation at the ﬁrm level are reported in parentheses . Coefﬁcients : * * Signiﬁcant at 1 % , * Signiﬁcant at 5 % level . 26 10 Discussion and conclusion We presented a model whereby shareholders appoint a board of directors and hire a manager . We considered a less independent and assumedly more friendly board , whose beliefs matched the manager ; in this case , the ﬁrm explores new strategies if the man - ager is sufﬁciently optimistic . A less friendly board makes the manager less likely to explore new strategies , because the manager fears a lack of control over the choice of strategy . Evidence to support this model comes from regulatory changes which made boards more independent . Following the model predictions , ﬁrms whose boards become more independent are less likely to explore new technologies and more likely to exploit pre - viously successful areas of expertise . Consistent with an increase in patents , patent claims , and citations , ﬁrms with more independent boards appear to work harder in less risky areas . The number of claims mediates the increase in patenting and citations , especially in the tails of the citation distribution . Firms with more independent boards work in older and more familiar areas of technology . They are also more likely to patent work by inventors with a longer tenure within the ﬁrm and also inventors who have been patenting longer in general . These more nuanced measures of search and exploration enable greater insight into the search and innovation process and highlight the importance of differentiating be - tween greater effort and incremental output vs . breakthrough inventions . Further work will seek to establish the impact of exploration and exploitation on the novelty and technical and ﬁnancial value of the ﬁrm’s inventions . 27 References Adams , R .

Because the board and manager share similar beliefs , such proposal will be approved by the board . There are two action plans to consider : exploring the new strategy in the ﬁrst pe - riod and switching to the conventional strategy in case of failure or exploring the new strategy in both periods . For an agent with belief µ , exploring the new strategy and switching in case of failure is better than exploiting the conventional strategy iff f ( µ ) S + ( 1 − f ( µ ) ) F + f ( µ ) (cid:18) f (cid:18) µ q H µ q H + ( 1 − µ ) q L (cid:19) ( q H S + ( 1 − q H ) F ) + (cid:18) 1 − f (cid:18) µ q H µ q H + ( 1 − µ ) q L (cid:19)(cid:19) ( q L S + ( 1 − q L ) F ) (cid:19) + ( 1 − f ( µ ) ) ( pS + ( 1 − p ) F ) ≥ 2 ( pS + ( 1 − p ) F ) ( 4 ) where f ( x ) = xq H + ( 1 − x ) q L . Equation ( 6 ) is equivalent to : µ ≥ ( 1 + q L ) ( p − q L ) ( 1 + q L + q H − p ) ( q H − q L ) ( 5 ) Exploring the new strategy in both periods regardless of outcomes is better than exploiting the conventional strategy iff 2 ( f ( µ ) S + ( 1 − f ( µ ) ) F ) ≥ 2 ( pS + ( 1 − p ) F ) . ( 6 ) In ( 6 ) , we use the fact that by Bayes’ rules beliefs follow a martingale . Equation ( 6 ) is equivalent to : µ ≥ p − q L q H − q L ( 7 ) Condition ( 5 ) is more stringent than ( 7 ) . Proof of Proposition 2 : From the proof of Proposition 1 , if an agent believes that exploring the new strategy in both periods regardless of output dominates exploiting the con - ventional strategy , then the agent also believes that exploring in the ﬁrst period and switching to exploitation in case of failure also dominates exploiting the conventional strategy . Therefore , a manager who believes that exploring in both periods is optimal will propose the new strategy as long as the board approves exploration at least in the 31 ﬁrst period . This gives rise to condition ( 2 ) . However , if the manager is only optimistic to implement exploration in the ﬁrst period but switch to exploitation in case of failure in the second period , he does not propose the new strategy if the board is optimistic to the point of wanting to implement exploration of the new strategy in both periods . This gives rise to condition ( 3 ) . Proof of Proposition 3 : If the manager is optimistic relative to shareholders about inno - vation ( µ M > µ S ) , an independent board with µ B = µ S induces the manager to propose any project with µ M ≥ ( 1 + q L ) ( p − q L ) ( 1 + q L + q H − p ) ( q H − q L ) as long as the project is proﬁtable to shareholders : µ S ≥ ( 1 + q L ) ( p − q L ) ( 1 + q L + q H − p ) ( q H − q L ) If the manager is pessimistic relative to shareholders about innovation ( µ M < µ S ) , we know from Proposition 2 that the manager may be reluctant to propose the new strategy if an independent board is likely to force him to stick to the new strategy even after failure . A friendly board ( µ M = µ S ) solves this problem , inducing the manager to propose a new strategy as long as µ M ≥ ( 1 + q L ) ( p − q L ) ( 1 + q L + q H − p ) ( q H − q L ) . Because shareholders are more optimistic than the manager about innovation , they al - ways want to implement exploration under the above conditions . 32
