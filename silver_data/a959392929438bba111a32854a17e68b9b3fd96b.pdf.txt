Areces 1 , 3 , Anika Steffen 5 , Theresia E . B . Stradal 5 , Pier Paolo Di Fiore 1 , 2 , 3 , Marie - France Carlier 4 and Giorgio Scita 1 , 3 WAVE2 belongs to a family of proteins that mediates actin reorganization by relaying signals from Rac to the Arp2 / 3 complex , resulting in lamellipodia protrusion . WAVE2 displays Arp2 / 3 - dependent actin nucleation activity in vitro , and does not bind directly to Rac . Instead , it forms macromolecular complexes that have been reported to exert both positive and negative modes of regulation . How these complexes are assembled , localized and activated in vivo remains to be established . Here we use tandem mass spectrometry to identify an Abi1 - based complex containing WAVE2 , Nap1 ( Nck - associated protein ) and PIR121 . Abi1 interacts directly with the WHD domain of WAVE2 , increases WAVE2 actin polymerization activity and mediates the assembly of a WAVE2 – Abi1 – Nap1 – PIR121 complex . The WAVE2 – Abi1 – Nap1 – PIR121 complex is as active as the WAVE2 – Abi1 sub - complex in stimulating Arp2 / 3 , and after Rac activation it is re - localized to the leading edge of ruffles in vivo . Consistently , inhibition of Abi1 by RNA interference ( RNAi ) abrogates Rac - dependent lamellipodia protrusion . Thus , Abi1 orchestrates the proper assembly of the WAVE2 complex and mediates its activation at the leading edge in vivo . Site - directed actin polymerization in response to signalling is at the origin of complex motile processes such as cell migration , neurite extension , and bud growth in yeast 1 . This is mediated by a family of proteins , including WASP , N - WASP and Scar / WAVE , that contain a VCA ( verprolin - homology , cofilin - homology and acidic region ) cat - alytic domain . This domain can bind to G - actin and the Arp2 / 3 com - plex , resulting in filament branching at the membrane 2 . Although the modes of WASP and N - WASP regulation have been elucidated 2 , much less is known about WAVE proteins . For example , WAVE2 was found to bind activated Rac through IRSp53 , which , in turn can stim - ulate WAVE2 - nucleating activity , suggesting a positive mode of regu - lation 3 . Conversely , WAVE1 was reported to be maintained in an inactive state through its association with three other proteins : Nap1 , PIR121 and HSPC300 ( ref . 4 ) . This complex is unable to stimulate actin polymerization in vitro . GTP - bound Rac relieves this inhibition by inducing the disassembly of the inhibitory Nap1 – PIR121 sub - com - plex from the active WAVE1 – HSPC300 . Additional complexity to this mode of action is suggested by the observations that Abi1 and Abi2 , two Abl - binding proteins 5 , 6 involved in Rac activation 7 , were identified as interactors of WAVE1 ( ref . 8 ) . Moreover , removing the Drosophila melanogaster homologues of Abi1 , WAVE , Nap1 and PIR121 by RNAi abolished formation of lamellipodia 9 , providing genetic evidence for interactions among these proteins . In any case , it seems that WAVEs assemble into multi - molecular units to function in vivo . How these complexes are assembled , localized and regulated in vivo is not known . Understanding how the activity of WAVE is regulated requires a detailed analysis of the topological / functional relationships of the various partners of WAVE within the complexes . Here we use a reductionist approach , involving the reconstitution and characteriza - tion of sub - complexes of WAVE , to provide insight into the essential protein – protein interactions that control WAVE activity . This approach emphasizes the role of Abi1 in the regulation of WAVE2 . To identify interactors of Abi1 , proteins specifically bound to Abi1 immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS – PAGE and then subjected to mass spectrometry ( Fig . 1a ) . The proteins that were unambiguously identified were : nebulin ; ninein ; auto T antigen ; PIR121 ( ref . 10 ; also named KIAA1168 ( ref . 11 ) , CYFIP2 ( ref . 12 ) and POP ( ref . 13 ) ) ; Sra - 1 ( ref . 14 ; also named KIAA0068 ( ref . 11 ) ) ; Nap1 ( also named Nap125 ( ref . 15 ) , NCKAP1 ( ref . 16 ) and KIAA0587 ) ; WAVE2 ; HSC70 ; and HSP70 ( Fig . 1a ; see Supplementary Information , Fig . S1a ) . Validation of PIR121 , Nap1 and WAVE2 as interactors of Abi1 was obtained by co - immunoprecipitation experiments . Immunoprecipitation of endogenous Abi1 resulted in the co - precipitation of PIR121 , Nap1 and WAVE2 ( Fig . 1b ) . In addition , PIR121 , Nap1 and Abi1 also associated with WAVE immunocomplexes in reciprocal co - immunoprecipitation experiments ( Fig . 1b ) . Together with the finding that al0l four proteins co - fractionate in gel filtration experiments ( see below ) , this indicates that they form a tight macromolecular complex in vivo .

To gain insight into the topological arrangement of the Abi1 com - plex , recombinant and purified proteins were used to reconstitute the complex in vitro and to map the interacting surfaces . Co - infection of insect cells with His – Abi1 and glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) – WAVE2 viruses followed by affinity precipitation using glu - tathione beads resulted in the co - purification of the two proteins ( Fig . 1c ) . This interaction was mediated by the amino - terminal WAVE homology domain ( WHD ; Fig . 1d ) . Notably , the WHD domain of WAVE1 interacts equally well with purified His – Abi1 ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S1b , c ) , supporting the possibility that this region defines a new protein – protein interaction domain . Removal of 145 amino acids from the N terminus of Abi1 abrogated interaction with the WAVE2 WHD domain . The association of Abi1 with this WAVE2 domain was retained when the SH3 - binding ability of Abi1 was impaired ( Fig . 1e ) or the entire proline - rich region and SH3 domain of Abi1 was removed ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S1d ) . The direct association between WAVE2 and Abi1 suggests that these proteins may represent the backbone on which the other components then assemble . Nap1 and PIR121 are often found together in different multimolecular complexes 4 , 13 , 18 , 19 . In this study , these features were exploited to affinity purify these proteins as a sub - complex from 293T cells overexpressing Flag – Nap1 and Myc – PIR121 , using immobilized anti - Flag antibodies .

Finally , purified His – Abi1 associ - ated with GST – Nap1 ( Fig . 2d ) , suggesting that Nap1 mediates the interaction of the Nap1 – PIR121 complex to Abi1 . Therefore , Abi1 is essential for the assembly of a WAVE2 – Abi1 – Nap1 – PIR121 macro - molecular complex . In agreement with an earlier finding 18 , the purified Nap1 – PIR121 sub - complex associated specifically with recombinant GTP - γ S - loaded Rac ( Fig . 2e , left panels ) , but not with GTP - loaded Cdc42 ( Fig . 2e , right panels ) . Moreover , no interaction was observed when Rac ( or Cdc42 ) was in a nucleotide - free or a GDP - bound state ( Fig . 2e ) . In addition , no binding between GTP - γ S – Rac1 and Nap1 or the WAVE2 – Abi1 complex could be detected ( see Supplementary Nap1 PIR121 GST − Rac Abi1 − + − + − + − + + 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 I n p u t PIR121 Nap1 WAVE2 Abi1 Rac IP : Abi1 Lysate R ac T 17 N R ac Q 61L C o n t r o l C o n t r o l c PIR121 Nap1 Abi1 WAVE2 GTP - γ S - Rac GTP - γ S - Rac Abi1 Nap1 I Rac GST 669 440 158 66 R ac T 17 N R ac Q 61L Transfection − + B l o t : a n t i - Rac - GTP PIR121 WAVE2 a b WAVE2 M r ( K ) B l o t : a n t i - Figure 3 The WAVE – Abi1 – Nap1 – PIR121 complex is stable after GTP - γ S - Rac binding .

Recombinant Rac loaded with GTP - γ S ( GTP - γ S - Rac ; 100 µ M ) was incubated with the pre - assembled GST – WAVE2 – Abi1 – Nap1 – PIR121 complex ( 100 nM ) immobilized on gluthatione beads .

( b ) Gel - filtration chromatography of endogenous WAVE proteins , Abi1 , Nap1 and PIR121 in the presence or absence of GTP - loaded Rac . Total cellular lysates of 293T cells ( 3 . 5 mg ) , incubated in the presence of GTP - γ S - bound Rac Q61L ( + ) , or GST as a control ( − ) , were applied onto a 200 - ml prep grade Superose 6 column . An aliquot of each fraction ( indicated at the top ) was resolved by SDS – PAGE and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies . The elution profile of proteins of known molecular weight is indicated at the bottom . The input lane contained 100 µ g of total cellular lysates . ( c ) The association of endogenous WAVE proteins , Nap1 and PIR121 to Abi1 is not altered by the expression of activated or dominant - negative mutants of Rac . Total cellular lysates of 293T cells transfected with Rac T17N , Rac Q61L or empty vector as a control , were immunoprecipitated with anti - Abi1 antibody . Lysate and immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies . More than 90 % of cells expressed the transfected Rac constructs , as judged by immunofluorescence microscopy analysis ( data not shown ) . Equal amounts of Abi1 were immunoprecipitated under the different experimental conditions . The electrophoretic mobility shift of Abi1 in the Rac Q61L lane is caused by phosphorylation ( data not shown ) . print ncb1105 17 / 3 / 04 3 : 11 PM Page 322 © 2004 Nature PublishingGroup © 2004 Nature PublishingGroup L E T T E R S NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 6 | NUMBER 4 | APRIL 2004 323 Information , Fig . S1f ) . Therefore , the Nap1 – PIR121 sub - complex links Rac to the WAVE2 – Abi1 complex . Consistently , GTP - γ S - loaded Rac could be recovered with the pre - assembled , immobilized GST – WAVE2 – Abi1 – Nap1 – PIR121 complex ( Fig . 3a , Methods ) . This indicates that unlike the WAVE1 – Nap1 – PIR121 – HSPC300 heterote - tramer ( which dissociates after binding to GTP - loaded Rac 4 ) , the WAVE2 – Abi1 – Nap1 – PIR121 complex is stable after addition of a 1 , 000 - fold molar excess of activated Rac . To test whether the stability of the complex in the presence of GTP - loaded Rac is physiologically relevant , different experimental approaches were undertaken . First , analysis of the elution profile of total cellular lysates by size exclusion chromatography revealed that WAVEs , Abi1 , Nap1 and PIR121 co - eluted at a relative molecular mass ( M r ) of approximately 500 , 000 ( 500 K ) . The addition of GTP - loaded Rac to the lysates before gel filtration chromatography ( Fig . 3b ) or transfection with a constitutively active Rac ( Rac Q61L ; see Supplementary Information , Fig . S2a ) did not alter the elution profile of any of the components of the complex . Notably , the amount of acti - vated Rac eluted with ( Fig . 3b ) , or associated with ( Fig . 3c ) , the endogenous WAVE – Abi1 – Nap1 – PIR121 complex was relatively small . However , this is expected when a protein is expressed to high levels through transient transfection or when an excess of recombinant pro - tein is used . Similar findings were obtained when total cellular lysates from mouse brain ( which express mainly the tissue specific WAVE1 and Abi2 proteins ) were used 20 , 21 .

Equimolar amounts ( 100 nM ) of WAVE1 , Abi1 , Nap1 , PIR121 and HSPC300 were used .

The concentration of actin was 2 . 5 µ M and that of the Arp2 / 3 complex was 10 nM . print ncb1105 17 / 3 / 04 3 : 11 PM Page 323 © 2004 Nature PublishingGroup © 2004 Nature PublishingGroup L E T T E R S 324 NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 6 | NUMBER 4 | APRIL 2004 WAVE2 proteins associate stably in an Abi – Nap1 – PIR121 complex ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S2b ) . Finally , ectopic expression of Rac Q61L ( Fig . 3c ) or treatment with EGF ( Fig . 1b ; also see Supplementary Information , Fig . S3c – e ) caused no reduction in the amount of WAVE , Nap1 or PIR121 co - immunoprecipitating with Abi1 . Thus , WAVE , Abi1 , Nap1 and PIR121 exist as a stable macromol - ecular complex both in vitro and in vivo . Next , we tested the ability of recombinant WAVE2 and the reconsti - tuted WAVE2 complex to activate Arp2 / 3 , in a pyrene - labelled actin polymerization assay . Recombinant WAVE2 activated the Arp2 / 3 com - plex , and the addition of Abi1 significantly increased this activity ( Fig . 4a ) . Conversely , addition of increasing amounts of the Nap1 – PIR121 sub - complex had no effect on activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex induced by WAVE2 ( data not shown ) or WAVE2 – Abi1 ( Fig . 4b ) . Similarly , a reconstituted pre - assembled WAVE2 – Abi1 – Nap1 – PIR121 complex attained the same activity as the WAVE2 – Abi1 complex ( data not shown ) . These results are in contrast to an earlier report , showing that WAVE1 is trans - inhibited when engaged in a complex containing Nap1 , PIR121 , HSPC300 , and possibly Abi2 ( ref . 4 ) . To test whether the presence of HSPC300 and / or intrinsic differences between the two WAVE proteins ( WAVE1 versus WAVE2 ) accounts for these discrepan - cies , we purified recombinant WAVE1 and HSPC300 and tested the actin polymerization activity of the reconstituted complexes containing either WAVE1 – Abi1 – Nap1 – PIR121 or WAVE2 – Abi1 – Nap1 – PIR121 . Both WAVE2 - and WAVE1 - based complexes displayed Arp2 / 3 - depend - ent actin - branching activity that was not significantly altered by the addition of HSPC300 ( Fig . 4c , d ) . Thus , Abi1 , but not HSPC300 , Nap1 or PIR121 , enhances the ability of WAVE proteins to stimulate Arp2 / 3 actin nucleation in vitro . However , the ability of PIR121 to mediate a direct interaction with Rac suggested that the activity of the WAVE2 – Abi1 – Nap1 – PIR121 complex might be regulated after the binding of GTP - loaded Rac . At least two mechanisms can be envi - sioned : the complex might have a basal level of activity that is modu - lated after Rac binding to achieve physiological relevance ; alternatively , Rac may regulate the complex in vivo by controlling its localization . For example , stimulation of Rac may recruit the complex to the lead - ing edge of lamellipodia , where actin nucleation occurs . No modula - tion in the ability of WAVE proteins ( data not shown ) or the WAVEs – Abi1 – Nap1 – PIR121 – HSPC300 complex to activate Arp2 / 3 could be observed after addition of a 20 - fold molar excess of GTP - loaded Rac in polymerization assays in vitro ( Fig . 4c , d ) . Conversely , transfection of HeLa cells with Rac Q61L , or stimulation with EGF ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S3a ) , induced re - localization of WAVE2 , Abi1 , Nap1 and PIR121 to the leading edge of ruffles ( Fig . 5a , Rac Q61L − Abi1 Abi1 Rac Q61L − Nap1 Nap1 PIR121 Rac Q61L − PIR121 WAVE2 Rac Q61L − WAVE2 Rac Q61L Phalloidin Merged pAV - Abi1 - 197 Abi1 Phalloidin Merged Arp3 Profilin Actin Abi1 pAV siRNA C o n t r o l 197 169 Control 197 169 R e l a t i v e A b i 1 m R N A e x p r e ss i o n 1 . 0 0 . 5 Cdc42 Q61L Rac Q61L Control K .

GFP and F - actin were detected by epifluorescence ( green ) , and by phalloidin staining ( red ) , respectively . The expression of GFP fusion proteins and Rac Q61L was assessed by staining with an anti - HA antibody ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . 5 ) . Endogenous Abi1 and WAVE2 accumulated into Rac Q61L - induced lamellipodia ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . 4g ) . Confocal apical sections are shown . ( c – e ) Silencing of Abi1 by siRNA .

( d , e ) Three representative stable clones ( obtained by limiting dilution ) for pAV - ctr ( ctr ) and pAV - Abi1 - 197 ( 197 ) and pAV - Abi1 - 169 ( 169 ) were analysed by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies ( d ) , or real - time , quantitative RT - PCR using specific Abi1 primers ( e ) . Data , normalized to GAPDH or actin mRNA , are expressed relative to the levels of Abi1 mRNA detected in control cells . ( f ) Abi1 gene silencing abrogates Rac - mediated actin remodelling . Control and Abi1 knock - down ( Abi K .

More than 90 % of transfected cells displayed the actin cytoskeleton phenotypes shown . Control and Abi1 knock - down HeLa clones were plated on FN - coated coverslips ( right ) . After various times , cells were fixed and stained for F - actin . Shown are cells fixed 180 min after plating .

S3b ) . Thus , a scenario can be envisioned whereby a WAVE2 – Abi1 – Nap1 – PIR121 complex exists in vivo and is recruited through a direct interaction with Rac to lamellipodia , where actin polymerization required for membrane protrusion is initiated and controlled . By potentiating the activation of WAVE2 actin polymerization in vitro , and the assembly of WAVE - containing complexes in vivo , Abi1 is predicted to function in Rac - dependent actin remodelling . To test this , we employed a small - interfering RNA strategy to knock down Abi1 transcripts . Abi1 expression could be successfully ablated in HeLa cells transfected with siRNA - expressing vectors , as determined by immunofluorescence microscopy , immunoblotting and quantitative RT - PCR analysis ( Fig . 5c , d ) . Analysis of the cyto - architecture of Abi1 knock - down cells indicated that they displayed an elongated morphol - ogy and an apparent reduction in the overall level of filamentous actin ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S3c ) . More importantly , they failed to undergo actin remodelling after expression of Rac Q61L , sup - porting the notion that the Abi1 - based complex is essential in this pathway ( Fig . 5f ) . This was confirmed by the observations that actin remodelling in response to a variety of stimuli known to activate Rac was impaired in Abi1 knock - down cells . A constitutively active Cdc42 mutant ( Cdc42 Q61L ) regulates the formation of Rac - independent filopodia and Rac - dependent lamellipodia 22 . In Abi1 knock - down cells , no ruffles were induced by Cdc42 Q61L expression , whereas the ability to form filopodia was retained ( Fig . 5f ) . Similarly , Rac - depend - ent lamellipodia were completely absent in Abi1 knock - down cells after adhesion to extracellular matrix ( ECM ) proteins 23 , such as fibronectin , and were able to spread on fibronectin by forming filopo - dia - like structures ( Fig . 5f ) . Finally , no ruffling was observed in Abi1 knock - down cells in response to EGF treatment , which induced activa - tion of Rac to levels similar to those observed in control cells ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S3d , e ) . A similar impairment in Rac - dependent membrane protrusion could also be observed after siRNA - mediated ablation of WAVE2 ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S3f – i ) , Nap1 or PIR121 ( refs 9 , 24 ) . Interestingly , functional removal of either WAVE2 ( Supplemental Information Fig . 4a ) or Abi1 ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S4b ) prevented the redistribu - tion of other components of the complex to the leading edge of lamel - lipodia , indicating that the integrity of the complex is essential for its proper localization . Finally , in agreement with recent reports 9 , 24 , blockade of Abi1 expression resulted in a substantial and specific down - regulation of WAVE2 , Nap1 and PIR121 protein levels ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S4c ) , without affecting levels of their transcripts ( data not shown ) . Therefore , Abi1 is also necessary for the stability of WAVE2 , Nap1 and PIR121 . In conclusion , the above data demonstrate that Abi1 is an essential component of WAVE2 - contain - ing signalling complexes and is required to mediate Rac - dependent actin remodelling . Our results indicate that Abi1 is an essential component of WAVE - containing macromolecular assemblies . Abi1 positively regulates WAVE1 and WAVE2 activities in vitro , and connects WAVE2 to Rac through the assembly of a WAVE2 – Abi1 – Nap1 – PIR121 complex . The WAVE2 – Abi1 – Nap1 – PIR121 complex is recruited to lamellipodia after Rac activation , resulting in site - directed nucleation of actin filaments . Binding of the WAVE ( s ) – Abi1 – Nap1 – PIR121 complex to Rac does not result in dissociation of the complex or affect its activity . These results are in contrast to recent findings , which reported that a WAVE1 - containing complex purified from mouse brain is inactive and that binding of GTP - Rac causes disruption of the complex and activation of WAVE1 ( ref . 4 ) . Several possibilities may account for these differences . For example , the exact composition and structure of the complexes , either isolated from brain tissues or reconstituted from recombinant proteins , as well as their state of post - translational modification , might be different . In our hands , however , there was no evidence for GTP - Rac - induced dissociation of endogenous WAVE - based complexes iso - lated from a variety of cell lysates ( Fig . 3 ; see Supplementary Information , Fig . S2a , b ) . We therefore favour the view that the WAVE complex is stable , active , and presumably able to bind Arp2 / 3 in the cytoplasm . However , the stimulation of actin assembly occurs only at the leading edge , raising the question of how WAVE - induced actin polymerization is controlled in a site - restricted fashion to elicit protru - sion . In this respect , it should be noted that the actual branching process requires the association of a ternary , WAVE – G - actin – Arp2 / 3 complex to filaments to elicit branching , thus multiplying growing barbed ends . In quiescent cells , filaments exist but barbed ends are mostly capped 25 , thereby preventing unwanted actin branching . Rac - dependent signalling results in the creation of new barbed ends by uncapping 25 and de novo nucleation , which is favoured by the increase in the steady - state concentration of G - actin that results from modulat - ing the severing and depolymerizing activity of ADF – cofilin 26 . These Rac - dependent processes occur in a site - restricted fashion , and they must cooperate with Rac - induced localization of WAVE to the leading edge to elicit the generation and efficient growth of new filaments nec - essary to drive cell protrusion and motility . METHODS Expression vectors , antibodies and cells . CMV ( Cytomegalovirus ) - promoter - based , EF ( Elongation Factor - 1 α ) - promoter - based eukaryotic expression vec - tors , and GST bacterial expression vectors were generated by recombinant PCR . HSPC300 was cloned by PCR from the UniGene Cluster Hs . 421654 . The pAV vector for suppression of gene expression was obtained by subcloning the H1 - polymerase III - dependent promoter into a mammalian expression vector . Gene - specific targeting sequences were cloned 3 ′ of the H1 promoter . pFastBac - GST - WAVE2 ( kindly provided by H . Miki ; ref . 3 ) or pFastBac HT containing the Abi1 ORF ( amino acid 2 – 480 ) were used as donors to generate recombinant bacmids according to Bac - to - Bac system ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) . All con - structs were sequence verified . Flag – Nap1 was from A . Yamamoto 27 . Myc – PIR121 was a gift of A . Schenck and has been previously described 12 . pEGFP – Nap1 and pEGFP – PIR121 were from T . Stradal ( GBF , Braunschweig , Germany ) . pGEX – WAVE1 was from L . Macheschy ( Birmhingham , UK ) . The DAWN ( D453A and W455N ) mutant of Abi1 , used in the experiments of Fig . 1e , is impaired in its ability to associate to its SH3 - dependent ligands . Antibodies were : rabbit polyclonal anti - Abi1 28 , monoclonal anti - His ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA ) , anti - HA11 and anti - Myc 9E10 ( Babco , Berkeley , CA ) , anti - Rac1 ( Transduction Laboratories , Lexington , CA ) , rabbit polyclonal anti - Ds ( RFP ) ( Clontech , Palo Alto , CA ) , monoclonal anti - Flag ( Sigma , St Louis , MO ) , monoclonal anti - actin and profilin ( Cytoskeleton , Denver , CO ) , rabbit polyclonal anti - Arp3 ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) . The monoclonal anti - Abi1 antibody was generated against the peptide PPVDYEDEEAAVVQYNDPYADGDPAWAPKNYI . Anti - Nap1 polyclonal serum recognizes a peptide spanning amino acids 1071 – 1085 ( Eurogentec , Belgium ) . Polyclonal anti - PIR121 / p140Sra , and anti - WAVE1 and anti - WAVE2 antibodies against specific peptides were from T . Stradal ( GBF , Braunschweig ) . GST – WAVE2 ( 407 – 498 ) fusion protein of WAVE2 was used as an immunogen to obtain anti - PAN - WAVE polyclonal antibodies ( also see supplementary information , Figs S1g and S3f ) . Where indicated , sera were affinity purified . Abi1 knock - down HeLa cells were generated by transfecting pAV vectors cod - ing for an Abi1 - specific targeting sequence ( pAV - Abi1 - siRNA ) . Two distinct pAV - Abi1 - siRNAs , spanning nucleotides 169 – 187 ( pAV169 ) and 197 – 215 ( pAV197 ) of human Abi1 , respectively , were used . They were equally efficient in inhibiting Abi1 expression and resulted in similar phenotypic alteration . Control cells were obtained by transfecting a pAV vector coding a scrambled sequence . The generation of stable mass populations and single clones of Abi1 knock - down were obtained after puromycin - mediated selection of cells transfected print ncb1105 17 / 3 / 04 3 : 11 PM Page 325 © 2004 Nature PublishingGroup © 2004 Nature PublishingGroup L E T T E R S 326 NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 6 | NUMBER 4 | APRIL 2004 with pAV vectors together with plasmids carrying a puromycin resistance gene . At least six independently isolated Abi1 knockdown clones were analysed and showed similar results . Abi1 gene silencing could also be observed in transient experiments and caused a similar impairment in Rac - dependent actin remodel - ling ( data not shown ) . Mass spectrometry . Total cell lysates ( 40 mg ) were immunoprecipitated with purified anti - Abi1 antibody , or control rabbit IgG coupled to Protein A – Sepharose . Proteins bound to the Abi1 immunocomplex were resolved by one - dimensional SDS – PAGE , visualized by Brilliant Blue G Colloidal ( Sigma ) staining , excised and then digested in the gel with trypsin , as described 29 . High - mass accuracy matrix - assisted laser - desorption ionization ( MALDI ) spectrom - etry was performed using a Voyager - DE BioSpectrometry workstation for MALDI time - of - flight mass spectrometer ( PerSeptive Biosystems , Foster City , CA ) . Matrix - related ions and trypsin autolysis products were used for internal calibration . Delayed ion extration resulted in peptide masses with better than 35 ppm mass accuracy on average . Profound Peptide Mapping Software ( Rockefeller University , version 4 . 10 . 5 ) was used to search a non - redundant protein sequence database ( at the National Center for Biotechnology Information ) . The MALDI data were sufficient for the unambiguous identifica - tion of the proteins . In the case of WAVE2 , nanoelectrospray peptide sequenc - ing was also performed ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S1a ) . Protein purification . His – Abi1 , GST – WAVE2 and the GST – WAVE2 – Abi1 com - plex were purified from Sf9 insect cells . Briefly , Sf9 cells infected with the appropriate viruses were lysed in 50 mM Tris - HCl at pH 8 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 1 mM dithiothreitol , 5 % glycerol , protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche , Basel , Switzerland ) , 1 mM NaF and 1 mM NaVO 4 . GST – WAVE2 and GST – WAVE2 – Abi1 complex were affinity purified using GS4B glu - tathione – Sepharose beads ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech , Piscataway , NJ ) . His – Abi1 was purified using Ni – NTA agarose ( Qiagen ) following standard procedures . Recombinant full - length Abi1 , WAVE1 , Nap1 , Rac1 , Cdc42 and WAVE2 fragments were all expressed as GST fusion proteins in BL21 Escherichia coli strain ( Stratagene , Cedar Creek , TX ) . Abi1 , produced either from insect cells ( as a histidine - tagged protein ) or from E . coli ( as a GST fusion protein ) , displayed the same binding capability to its partners and similar activity for actin polymerization in vitro . Thrombin ( Calbiochem - Novabiochem , San Diego , CA ) was used to cleave GST from GST – Rac1 , which was loaded with GDP or GTP - γ S as described 7 . The PIR121 – Nap1 sub - complex was affinity purified from 293T cells trans - fected with Flag – Nap1 together with Myc – PIR121 plasmids , using anti - Flag antibodies coupled to agarose beads ( Sigma ) . Bound proteins were eluted with a Flag peptide ( Sigma ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Eluted pro - teins were dialysed in 50 mM Tris - HCl , 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM dithiothreitol and 20 % glycerol . PIR121 – Nap1 and GST – WAVE2 – Abi1 sub - complexes were quan - tified with respect to the molarities of Flag – Nap1 or GST – WAVE2 , respectively . In contrast to the Nap1 – PIR121 complex , which was readily soluble and sta - ble , purified Nap1 or PIR121 ( derived from 293T cells overexpressing Flag – Nap1 or Myc – PIR121 , respectively ) was precipitated after the immunoaffinity purification . Nap1 , but not PIR121 , could be obtained from bacteria as a GST fusion protein ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S2 ) . Actin was isolated from rabbit muscles and purified in the Ca - ATP – G - actin form by Sephadex G - 200 chromatography in G buffer ( 5 mM Tris - HCl at pH 7 . 8 , 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 1 mM dithiothreitol and 0 . 01 % NaN 3 ) . Actin was fluorescently labelled with pyrenil - iodoacetamide 30 . The C - terminal domain ( VCA ) of human N - WASP was expressed as a recombinant GST fusion protein and separated from GST by proteolytic cleavage 30 . The Arp2 / 3 complex was purified from bovine brain 30 . Biochemical assays . Standard procedures for protein analysis , in vitro binding , cell lysis and co - immunoprecipitation were as described 7 . Rac1 binding was measured by affinity precipitation as previously described 7 , exploiting GST – CRIB ( Cdc42 - and Rac - interactive region ) of PAK65 as a positive control . Reconstitution of the PIR121 – Nap1 – Abi1 – WAVE2 complex in vitro was obtained by incubating equimolar amounts of PIR121 – Nap1 sub - complex and GST – WAVE2 – Abi1 complex coupled to glutathione – agarose beads . Where indi - cated , equimolar amounts of HSPC300 were also added . The final concentration of each sub - complex in the mix was 100 nM . After a 1 - h incubation and exten - sive washes , bound proteins were resolved by SDS – PAGE and visualized with appropriate antibodies . When Rac - GTP - γ S was used , in vitro binding was per - formed in nucleotide - loading buffer 7 to preserve Rac loading . For gel filtration analysis , 293T cells were lysed in 25 mM Tris - HCl at pH 7 . 6 , 100 mM NaCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 5 mM EGTA , 5 % glycerol and 1 % Triton X - 100 . Lysates were centrifuged at 15 , 000 g for 20 min . Supernatants ( 3 . 5 mg total protein ) were then applied on a 200 - ml prep grade Superose 6 column equilibrated in 25 mM Tris - HCl at pH 7 . 6 , 100 mM NaCl , 10 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 1 mM EGTA and 5 % glycerol . The molecular weight of the eluted Abi1 - based complex was judged by comparison with the elution profile of molecular weight standards . Aliquots of each fraction were resolved by SDS – PAGE and immunoblotted with the appropriate antibodies . When indicated , GTP - γ S - loaded GST – Rac Q61L or GST – Rac , or GST alone , were incubated at 4 ° C with total cellular lysates in the presence of 10 mM MgCl 2 to preserve Rac loading before size exclusion chromatography . Notably , other known Abi1 - binding partners , such as Eps8 , Sos - 1 and Abl , did not co - elute together with Abi1 , indi - cating that they are not part of the WAVE2 – Abi1 – Nap1 – PIR121 core complex . Actin polymerization was monitored by the increase in fluorescence of 10 % pyrenil - labelled actin . Polymerization was induced by addition of 0 . 1 M KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 and 0 . 2 mM EGTA to a solution of Ca - ATP – G - actin containing Arp2 / 3 and the different proteins , as described in Fig . 4 . Fluorescence measure - ments were performed at 20 ° C in a Safax flx spectrofluorometer in which polymerization time courses of up to ten samples can be monitored simultane - ously . Abi1 , Nap1 , PIR121 and HSPC300 had no effect on actin polymerization perfomed in presence of actin and Arp2 / 3 ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S4d ) . Transfection and immunofluorescence microscopy . Cells seeded on gelatin were transfected with the indicated expression vectors using the LIPOfectamine reagent ( Invitrogen ) , according to the manufacturer’s instruc - tions . After 48 h , cells were processed for epifluorescence or indirect immuno - fluorescence microscopy . Briefly , cells were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde for 10 min , permeabilized in 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 and 2 % BSA for 10 min , and then incubated with the primary antibody for 45 min , followed by incubation with the secondary antibody for 30 min . F - actin was detected by staining with rho - damine - conjugated phalloidin ( Sigma ) at a concentration of 6 . 7 U ml − 1 . Where indicated , cells were treated with EGF ( 100 ng ml − 1 ) for 10 min . For spreading assays , Abi1 knock - down and the corresponding control cells were detached from the plate , incubated in medium containing 10 % serum for 1 h before seeding on fibronectin - coated coverslips . Cells were fixed at different times and processed for indirect immunofluorescence microscopy to detect F - actin . Note : Supplementary Information is available on the Nature Cell Biology website .
