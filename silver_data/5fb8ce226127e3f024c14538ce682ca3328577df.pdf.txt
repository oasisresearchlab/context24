Classic Decision Theory 16 . 422 • People are not always “rational” decision makers – But people are proficient • Situation - action matching decision rules – As opposed to choosing an alternate • Context - bound informal modeling as opposed to context - free formal modeling • Process orientation as opposed to prediction of outcomes • Empirical - based prescriptions Forms of NDM 16 . 422 • Recognition primed decision making • Related theories / methods – Critical decision method – Explanation based theory – Image theory Recognition Primed Decision Making ( RPD ) 16 . 422 • Intuitive form of diagnosis and prediction – Pattern matching • Multiple cues , highly correlated – Key observations • Requires learning and expertise – Experts choose feasible course of action without analyzing all or even many options • Decision making under uncertainty , time - pressure , & stress – Military commanders & firefighters • What biases might we see in RPD ? RPD Process 16 . 422 • Boundary conditions : expertise , time - pressure , uncertainty / ill - defined goals • Recognition • Situation Understanding – plausible goals – critical cues – expectancies – typical actions • Serial Evaluation • Mental Simulation Coping With Uncertainty • Inadequate understanding , lack of information , conflicted alternatives • RAWFS heuristic – Reducing uncertainty • Gathering more information – Assumption - based reasoning • Filling in gaps – Weighing pros and cons – Forestalling • Anticipate undesirable consequences – Suppressing uncertainty • Rationalization 16 . 422 Recognition / Meta - cognition Model 16 . 422 • Another model ( framework ? ) for how decision makers cope with uncertainty • Pattern matching critical • What happens when recognition fails ? – Decision makers revert to assumption - based reasoning and meta - cognitive processes • Attempt to find flaws & weaknesses in evaluation • STEP : Construct a story , test , evaluate , & plan – A prescriptive approach NDM and Teams 16 . 422 • How does team decision making differ from individual ? • Team SA and shared mental models • Studying teams in their natural environment – Real teams performing real tasks in real settings – Contextual focus as opposed to more general and abstract • Team research is not easy CTA Methods for NDM Research • critical decision method in which participants are asked to describe a specific decision - making incident in detail and then to respond to probes seeking elaboration of important aspects of the decision sequences . • Semantic mapping ( a . k . a . , mind - mapping , idea mapping , word webbing , etc . ) is a term which describes a variety of strategies designed to show how key words or concepts are related to one another through graphic representations . Mapping is an effective technique for teaching vocabulary and textual patterns of organization ; and it is also effective for improving note taking and creative thinking skills .
