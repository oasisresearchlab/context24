The F - BAR - domain - containing proteins are prime candidates to couple actin dynamics and membrane trafﬁcking in different morpho - genetic processes . Results : Here , we present the functional analysis of the Drosophila F - BAR protein Cip4 / Toca1 ( Cdc42 - interacting protein 4 / transducer of Cdc42 - dependent actin assembly 1 ) . Cip4 is able to form a complex with WASP and SCAR / WAVE and recruits both actin - nucleation - promoting factors to invag - inating membranes and endocytic vesicles . Actin - comet - tail - based movement of these vesicles depends not only on WASP but largely on WAVE function . In vivo , loss of cip4 function causes multiple wing hairs . A similar phenotype is observed when vesicle scission is affected after Dynamin suppression . Gene dosage experiments show that Cip4 and WAVE functionally interact to restrict wing hair formation . Further rescue experiments conﬁrm that Cip4 is able to act through WAVE and WASP in vivo . Biochemical and functional data support a model in which Cdc42 acts upstream of Cip4 and recruits not only WASP but also SCAR / WAVE via Abi to control Dynamin - dependent cell polarization in the wing . Conclusion : Cip4 integrates membrane trafﬁcking and actin dynamics through WASP and WAVE . First , Cip4 promotes membrane invaginations and triggers the vesicle scission by recruiting Dynamin to the neck of nascent vesicles . Second , Cip4 recruits WASP and WAVE proteins to induce actin poly - merization , supporting vesicle scission and providing the force for vesicle movement . Introduction Actin polymerization drives the propulsion of membrane vesicles and participates in the reshaping of the plasma mem - brane in a variety of morphogenetic events . Members of the WASP family of proteins ( WASP and SCAR / WAVE ) are central regulators of the actin - nucleating complex Arp2 / 3 [ 1 , 2 ] , which is differentially activated in development [ 3 , 4 ] . WAVE proteins are mainly found in a pentameric heterocomplex that contains the Abelson interactor ( Abi ) , Kette / Nap1 , Sra - 1 / CYFIP , and HSPC300 [ 5 ] . Formation of the WAVE complex contributes to localization and stability of WAVE [ 6 – 8 ] , and reconstitution experiments have recently conﬁrmed its trans - inhibitory role [ 9 , 10 ] . WASP proteins are thought to be autoinhibited . In vitro , this autoinhibition can be relieved by different cellular compo - nents , including Cdc42 , PIP2 , Nck , Abi , or Toca - 1 [ 11 – 14 ] . Toca - 1 ( transducer of Cdc42 - dependent actin assembly 1 ) is a member of the Cip4 ( Cdc42 - interacting protein 4 ) sub - family of F - BAR proteins [ 15 , 16 ] . In vitro , Toca - 1 is required for full , Cdc42 - induced activation of the N - WASP complex [ 14 ] . In addition , the highly conserved F - Bar domain or ex - tended FCH domain ( EFC ) binds and deforms membranes [ 17 , 18 ] . Previous studies provided important mechanistic insights into how ring - like F - BAR oligomers induce membrane tubulation , and F - BAR proteins have been shown to be in - volved in clathrin - mediated endocytosis and cell movement [ 17 – 20 ] . However , there are only few studies that address the role of F - BAR proteins at the multicellular level in a develop - mental context . Here , we elucidate the physiological role of the Drosophila Cip4 in S2R + cells and in vivo . Biochemical , cell biological , and genetic data identify Cip4 as a central player at the cross - roads of different signaling pathways regulating WASP and WAVE - mediated actin polymerization that drive membrane dynamics . Results Drosophila Cip4 Deforms Membranes In Vitro The domain structure of Drosophila Cip4 protein resembles its mammalian orthologs . It contains an N - terminal Fer / Cip4 homology domain ( FCH ) followed by a coil - coiled domain ( to - gether referred to as F - BAR domain ) , a Cdc42 - binding HR1 domain , several proline - rich stretches , and a C - terminal Src - homology 3 ( SH3 ) domain ( Figure 1A ) . To test whether the F - BAR domain of Drosophila Cip4 is able to deform liposomes into tubules , we incubated synthetic liposomes containing Rhodamin - conjugated Phosphoethanolamine ( PE ) with gluta - thione S - transferase ( GST ) fusion of the Cip4 full - length protein , the F - BAR domain , or GST alone ( Figure 1B ) . Fluores - cence microscopy conﬁrmed a strong tubulation activity of the full - length protein and the F - BAR domain , indicating that the F - BAR domain is sufﬁcient to deform membranes in vitro ( Figure 1B ) . Drosophila Cip4 Tubulates Membranes In Vivo and Localizes at Highly Dynamic Vesicles We next examined the membrane - deforming properties of Drosophila Cip4 in vivo by using EGFP fusions of full - length and different mutant Cip4 proteins ( Figures 1A and 1C ) . Full - length Cip4 - EGFP localizes at highly dynamic vesicular and tubular structures in Drosophila S2R + cells that emerge from the plasma membrane , invaginate , and move within the cell ( Figure 1C ; see also Movie S1 available online ) .

Drosophila Cip4 Tubulates Membranes In Vitro and In Vivo ( A ) Schematic view of the full - length Drosophila Cip4 protein and four deletion variants . Cip4 is characterized by an N - terminal Fer / Cip4 homology ( FCH ) domain ( blue ) followed by a coil - coiled domain ( green ) , which are together referred to as the F - BAR domain . Cip4 also contains a Rho effector or protein kinaseC - relatedkinasehomologyregion1 ( HR1 ; orange ) thatbindsactivatedCdc42andacarboxy - terminalSH3domain ( red ) . Asummaryofthetubulation activity of a full - length Cip4 - EGFP protein in S2R + cells compared to distinct Cip4 deletions is indicated . ( B ) Synthetic liposomes containing 10 % rhodamin - conjugated Phosphoethanolamine ( PE ) were incubated with recombinant GST , GST - Cip4 - wt , or GST - Cip4 - F - BAR protein and examined by ﬂuorescence microscopy . Scale bar represents 10 m m . Current Biology Vol 19 No 17 1430 with previous reports , the membrane tubulation activity re - quires the F - BAR domain . Deletion of the ﬁrst 331 amino acids ( Cip4 D F - BAR - EGFP ) results in a diffuse cytoplasmic distribu - tion of Cip4 ( Movie S2 ) . Surprisingly , the F - BAR domain of Cip4 is not sufﬁcient to induce membrane tubulation in S2R + cells ( Movie S3 ) , in contrast to our observation in vitro . Cip4 F - BAR - EGFP diffusely localizes in the cytoplasm or accumu - lates in large structures ( Movie S3 ; Figure S1A ) . Flotation experiments reveal that signiﬁcant amounts of the Cip4 F - BAR - EGFP protein localize at membranes from internal sources rather than protein aggregates ( Figure S1B ) . Given that in vitro , the F - BAR protein fragment is sufﬁcient to deform liposomes , the intrinsic activity of the F - BAR domain might be inhibited or additional factors might be required to induce membrane tubulation in vivo . Membrane tubulation induced by Cip4 does not require the C - terminal SH3 domain . On the contrary , expression of the Cip4 - EGFP protein lacking the SH3 domain ( Cip4 D SH3 - EGFP ) enhances the formation of long membrane tubules that fail to pinch off from the plasma membrane ( Figure 1D ; Movie S4 ) . Thus , the SH3 domain of Cip4 appears to mediate membrane scission . Most of the highly dynamic Cip4 - positive vesicles emerging from the cell periphery are endocytic vesicles labeled by Texas - Red - conjugated Avidin ( Movie S5 ) , a known tracer that becomes internalized by clathrin - dependent endocytosis in Drosophila [ 21 ] . Consistently , we found a partial colocaliza - tion of endogenous Cip4 and the early endosome marker Rab5 ( Figure S2A ) . Cip4 Recruits and Promotes Actin - Based Endosome Movement through WASP and WAVE The movement of Cip4 - marked vesicles requires actin poly - merization . Latrunculin A treatment that depolymerizes F - actin [ 22 ] completely abolished vesicle movement ( Movie S6 ) . Actin depolymerization enhances the formation of thin and often fragmented membrane tubules that are formed along microtu - bules ( Movie M6 ) . To directly visualize actin - driven movement of Cip4 - marked vesicles , we generated cells stably expressing Cip4 - EGFP and Actin - Cherry ( Figure 1E ; Movie S7 ) . Live - imaging analysis of these cells clearly demonstrates actin tails pushing vesicles forward ( 0 . 1 m m / s ) . Drosophila Cip4 is able to bind WASP via its SH3 domain ( Figure 2D ) and activates WASP in vitro at low WASP concentrations ( Figure S2C ) . This prompted us to test whether the actin - based movement of Cip4 - positive vesicles depends on WASP function . Reduc - tion of WASP by RNAi resulted in a decreased vesicle motility ( 0 . 05 m m / s ; Figures 1E and 1F ; Movie S8 ) . Cells with a strong reduction of the WASP protein level ( Figures S2E and S2F ) are still able to form actin comet tails to move Cip4 - marked vesicles ( Figure 1F ) . Given the fact that Latrunculin A treatment completely abolished vesicle movements , we next tested whether Arp2 / 3 , WAVE , and Abi function are required for vesicle rocketing . Interestingly , we found that Arp2 , WAVE , and Abi are absolutely required for vesicle motility . Reduction of Arp2 / 3 , WAVE , and Abi resulted in a strong reduction of vesicle velocity ( 0 . 018 – 0 . 022 m m / s ; Figures 1E and 1F ; Movies S9 – S11 ) . This indicates that vesicle rocketing depends on Arp2 / 3 function as well as on both Arp2 / 3 activators , WAVE and WASP . Consistently , endogenous WASP and WAVE proteins localize at the site of Cip4 - marked rocketing vesicles ( Figure 1G and Figures S2A and S2B ) . Supporting this notion , we are able to visualize the dynamic colocalization of WASP - and WAVE - Cherry ( at low expression level ) at the site of Cip4 - EGFP - marked rocketing vesicles in living cells ( Movies S12 and S13 ) . Thus , Cip4 recruits both WASP and WAVE to control membrane vesicle movement . Cip4 Directly Binds WASP and Indirectly WAVE via Abi We found that Cip4 interacts not only directly with WASP but also indirectly with WAVE via Abi ( Figures 2A – 2F ) . In Cip4 GST pull - down assays and in coimmunoprecipitation experi - ments , we detected WAVE ( Figures 2A and 2C ) . In addition , we found all members of the WAVE complex ( Kette , Sra - 1 , and Abi ) in the GST - pull - down assay but not the actin regulator Ena ( Figure 2A , data not shown ) . In a yeast two - hybrid ap - proach , Cip4 does not directly bind WAVE but interacts with Abi , the central component of the pentameric WAVE complex ( Figures 2D and 2E ) . This interaction is mediated by the SH3 domain of Cip4 , which is required and sufﬁcient to bind not only WASP but also Abi ( Figure 2D ) . Moreover , Cip4 - SH3 - EGFP coprecipitates not only WASP but also WAVE , suggest - ing that Abi mediates the interaction between Cip4 and WAVE ( Figure 2F ) . To investigate whether Cip4 is sufﬁcient to relocalize WASP , WAVE , and Abi in vivo to membrane tubules , we expressed WASP - EGFP , WAVE - EGFP , or Abi - EGFP either alone or to - gether with an untagged full - length Cip4 protein . Whereas ﬂuorescent protein fusions alone show a punctuate distribu - tion within the cell , strong coexpression with Cip4 results in a complete recruitment of WASP , WAVE , and Abi to membrane tubules induced by Cip4 expression ( Figure 2G ) . Again , this interaction depends on an intact SH3 domain of Cip4 . Deletion of the SH3 domain disrupts the recruitment of WASP and WAVE to Cip4 - induced membrane tubules ( Figure S3 , Movies S14 – S17 ) . In all cases , the coexpression of Cip4 with high levels of WASP , WAVE , or Abi leads to an increase of mem - brane tubules compared to cells only expressing Cip4 . To further corroborate the evidence that Cip4 can interact with WASP and WAVE , we performed gel - ﬁltration chromatog - raphy analysis from S2R + and wing imaginal disc cell lysates and determined the distribution of endogenous Cip4 , WASP , and WAVE ( Figures 2H and 2I ) . In cytosolic S2R + cell extracts , Cip4 cofractionated with the main peak of WASP at the size of 200 – 300 kDa complexes , whereas WAVE is found in 400 – 500 kDa complexes ( Figure 2H ) . There is , however , a consider - able overlap of WAVE and Cip4 at complex sizes 200 – 300 kDa .

Cip4 / Toca - 1 Couples Membrane and Actin Dynamics 1431 A second maximum in the Cip4 protein distribution is found in a fraction that contains the highest amount of WAVE and Abi ( Figure 2H ) . The cofractionation of Cip4 and WAVE is obvious in gel - ﬁltration proﬁles from wing imaginal discs ( Figure 2I ) . Here , Cip4 is exclusively present in 400 – 500 kDa complexes completely overlapping with the occurrence of WAVE ( Figure 2I ) . Interestingly , in wing imaginal discs , WASP cofrac - tionated not only at complex sizes at 200 – 300 kDa but also at Figure 2 . Cip4 Can Recruit not Only WASP but Also WAVE ( A ) Afﬁnity precipitation of GST - Cip4 coupled to glutathione beads resulted in the copuriﬁcation of the WASP , WAVE , and Kette from total cell lysate of Drosophila S2R + cells .

The elution proﬁle of proteins of known molecular weight is indicated at the bottom . Current Biology Vol 19 No 17 1432 higher complex sizes close to but distinct from WAVE com - plexes . In summary , these data indicate that Cip4 can form functional complexes with WAVE in vivo . Loss of cip4 Function Affects Wing Hair Formation To further test the interaction of Cip4 and WAVE , we generated cip4 mutant ﬂies ( cip4 D 32 , cip4 D 63 ) by imprecise excision utilizing a P - element insertion in the 5 0 - UTR of the cip4 gene ( Figure 3A ) . In the deletion , cip4 D 32 , the ﬁrst two exons including the start codon are removed , resulting in a complete loss of Cip4 protein expression ( Figure 3B ; Figure S5 ) . cip4 D 32 mutants are viable and show wing hair defects ( Figures 3D , 3E , and 3H ) . Whereas wild - type wing cells form single hairs [ 23 ] , cip4 D 32 animals show wing hair duplications in about 30 % of the cells ( Figures 3F – 3H and 3W ) . The orientation of wing hairs is not affected . Similar wing hair defects were found after suppression of cip4 function by RNAi ( Figures 3I – 3L ) . Re - expression of Cip4 in cip4 D 32 mutants completely rescues the multiple - wing - hair phenotype , conﬁrming that cip4 is required for wing epithelium polarization ( Figures 3 M – 3P ) . Restriction of Wing Hair Numbers Depends on Arp2 / 3 and Requires WAVE but Not WASP Function Cip4 directly binds WASP and enhances WASP - mediated actin polymerization in vitro ( Figure S2C ) . Thus , we examined whether wasp function is also required for wing hair formation . Neither zygotic wasp mutants nor animals expressing a domi - nant - negative WASP protein ( WASP D CA ) or different wasp RNAi transgenes show wing hair defects ( data not shown ; Fig - ure 3Q ) . Cip4 is also able to form a complex with WAVE . Figure 3 . cip4 Genetically Interacts with wave ( A ) Schematicoverviewofthe cip4 locus .

Cip4 / Toca - 1 Couples Membrane and Actin Dynamics 1433 Homozygous wave mutants [ 24 ] die at late larval stages . However , the expression of RNAi constructs in wing imaginal discs leads to a low percentage of wing hair duplication ( 1 % – 2 % of the cells ; Figure 3R ) . Similar wing hair duplications were also observed in ﬂies expressing arp2 dsRNA ( Figure 3S ) and in arp 2 MARCM clones ( data not shown ) , suggesting that Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerization has a supportive func - tion in restricting wing hair number . cip4 Genetically Interacts with WAVE and WASP To further test whether WAVE and Cip4 act together in restrict - ing wing hair number , we conducted gene dosage experi - ments . The modulation of a mutant phenotype by reduction of the expression of interacting genes is a well - established tool for unraveling genetic interactions [ 25 ] . The removal of one copy of the wasp gene did not modify the cip4 D 32 mutant phenotype ( Figures 3T , 3U , and 3W ) . However , the reduction of the wave dosage by 50 % results into a two - fold increase of cells with multiple wing hairs ( 58 % ; Figures 3T , 3V , and 3W ) . These data demonstrate that Cip4 and WAVE not only form a complex but also act together in restricting the number of wing hairs . Moreover , we found that expression of WAVE or the more strongly expressed WAVE - EGFP substantially sup - presses the formation of multiple wing hairs induced by the cip4 RNAi transgene , indicating that cip4 acts through wave in vivo ( Figure 3W ) . Interestingly , the coexpression of WASP results in a complete rescue ( Figure 3W ) , suggesting that although WASP is not the normal agent during wing hair outgrowth , ectopic expression will sufﬁce . The rescue efﬁ - ciency appears to depend largely on the level of expression . Western - blot analysis from wing discs expressing untagged WASP and WAVE conﬁrms signiﬁcant expression differences resulting in different rescue efﬁciencies ( Figure S5B ) . Cip4 Binds Activated Cdc42 , which Is Also Required for Restriction of Wing Hair Number Genetic studies suggested that cdc42 is involved in planar polarization and wing hair outgrowth [ 26 ] . As described for the vertebrate Cip4 [ 27 ] , Drosophila Cip4 binds activated Cdc42 ( Figures 4A and 4C ) . In GST - pull - down experiments , activated Cdc42 can precipitate Abi and WAVE in a Cip4 - dependent manner ( Figures 4B and 4C ) , suggesting that acti - vated Cdc42 can recruit a complex containing Cip4 , Abi , and WAVE . This implies that suppression of abi function should affect wing hair formation . To test this , we expressed an abi dsRNA in wing imaginal disc and noted wing hair duplications similar to what we observed after wave or arp2 gene suppres - sion ( data not shown ) . We next analyzed whether cdc42 is required for restriction of wing hair number . To suppress cdc42 function , we used two strategies . First , we expressed a dominant - negative Cdc42 protein ( Cdc42 N17 ) in a temporally and spatially controlled manner by combining the UAS / Gal4 with the Gal80 ts system ( Figure4D ) . Second , wegeneratedEGFP - labeled cdc42 mutant wing cell clones ( MARCM clones , Figure 4E ) . In both cases , we found the induction of multiple wing hairs ( Figures 4D and 4E ) . Cip4 Localization Is Dynamic and Depends on Cdc42 Function We next analyzed whether loss of cdc42 function affects the localization of Cip4 protein . In wild - type cells at the time of wing hair formation , Cip4 accumulates in punctuated struc - tures at the distal side in close proximity to F - actin - rich pre - hairs ( Figure S4A ) . At later stages , Cip4 localizes along the membrane and at the tips of growing prehairs . A similar local - ization of Cip4 can be observed in transgenes expressing Cip4 - EGFP ( Figure S4B , Movies S18 and S19 ) . In cdc42 mutant clones , the localization of Cip4 is dramatically changed ( Figure 4F ) . In wild - type cells , Cip4 protein localizes apically at the distal cell vertex , whereas in cdc42 mutant cells its restricted apical localization is lost and Cip4 distributes uniformly within the cdc42 mutant cells . Further confocal image analysis reveals that Cip4 concentrates basolaterally near the membrane in cdc42 mutant cells , suggesting that loss of cdc42 function might also affect the trafﬁcking at the basal side . Thus , Cdc42 function seems to act upstream of Cip4 , regulating the subcellular localization of Cip4 . Restriction of Wing Hair Numbers Depends on Endocytosis that Requires Dynamin and Cip4 function On the basis of our observations in Drosophila cell culture , Cip4 appears to participate in different steps of endocytosis , including membrane invagination , membrane ﬁssion , and en - dosome movement . However , whether endocytosis is re - quired to restrict wing hair number is unknown . To address this , we analyzed wings expressing a temperature - sensitive mutant Dynamin protein ( Dyn ts , [ 28 ] ) . Inhibition of Dynamin function at 26 hr after puparium formation ( APF ) , shortly before the prehair initiation starts , results in the wing - hair - duplication phenotype resembling cip4 mutant wings ( Figure 5C ) . Expres - sion of Dyn ts at earlier stages ( L3 larvae ) resulted in a dramatic induction of wing hairs ( Figure 5B ) . The ectopic wing hairs were often shorter and pointed in all directions , suggesting that Dynamin also functions earlier in pupal wing development . Dynamin function is required for multiple steps of endocy - tosis [ 29 ] . Most importantly , Dynamin mediates the scission of newly formed vesicles . F - BAR proteins such as Cip4 are thought to facilitate the scission by recruiting Dynamin to the neck of a nascent vesicle [ 29 ] . This recruitment requires the SH3 domain that binds to Proline - rich motifs of Dynamin [ 30 ] . In line with this , the expression of a mutant Cip4 D SH3 protein but not wild - type Cip4 protein strongly induces multiplewinghairs ( Figures5Dand5E ) , suggesting thatablock of vesicle scission causes the multiple - wing - hair phenotype . Discussion Despite the detailed structural and biochemical knowledge aboutthemodeofactionofF - BARproteins , ourunderstanding how these proteins might function in the cellular and develop - mental context is still quite limited . In this study , we analyzed the role of the Drosophila F - BAR protein Cip4 / Toca - 1 in S2R + cell culture as well as in the developmental context of the ﬂy . We provide the ﬁrst evidence that Cip4 / Toca - 1 is able to inte - grate membrane trafﬁcking and actin dynamics not only through WASP but in particular through WAVE . Our results support a model in which Cdc42 acts upstream of Cip4 and recruits WAVE via Abi to shape wing hair morphogenesis . We propose that Cip4 acts at two different steps of endocy - tosisduringwingepithelium polarization ( Figure5F ) . First , Cip4 promotesmembraneinvaginationsandtriggersthescissionbyrecruitingDynamintotheneckofnascentvesicles . A block of this essential early endocytic step by suppression of Dynamin orCip4function resultsinsimilarphenotypes . Thisobservation highlights for the ﬁrst time the importance of endocytic traf - ﬁcking for wing hair formation . Subsequently , Cip4 recruits WAVE to induce actin polymerization , providing the force for vesicle movement . A block of both processes , loss of Current Biology Vol 19 No 17 1434 membrane invagination mediated by Cip4 and decreased membrane motility due to the loss of the membrane - associ - ated F - actin results in stronger defects and therefore a stronger - wing - hair phenotype . Following this assumption , en - hanced actin polymerization after overexpression of WAVE or WASP can indeed compensate for the lack of Cip4 function in promoting membrane invagination . These data indicate that WASPandWAVEarelargelyinterchangeable , althoughendog - enous WASP and WAVE proteins regulate Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerization in a cell - speciﬁc manner . In conclusion , Cip4 is in a central position to control the formation of F - actin via recruitment and subsequent activation of WAVE . Moreover , because we have recently demonstrated a tissue - speciﬁc interaction of Cip4 with WASP regulating the Figure 4 .

Experimental Procedures Cell Culture , Cell Transfection , and Immunoﬂuorescence Microscopy Drosophila S2R + cells [ 31 ] were cultured and transfected as described previously [ 7 ] . For con - focal spinning - disc imaging microscopy , cells were replated on chambered cover glass ( Lab - Tek ) pretreated with Concavalin A . Vesicle speed was measured in S2R + cells stably expressing Actin - CherryandCip4 - EGFPbytrackingthepathsof140individualvesicles in seven cells with ImageJ ( http : / / rsb . info . nih . gov / ij / ) and the Manual Tracking plug - in ( http : / / rsbweb . nih . gov / ij / plugins / track / track . html ) . Fly Genetics Allcrosseswereperformedat25 (cid:2) Cunlessotherwiseindicated . Thefollowing strainswereused ( seeFlyBaseforreference ) : Df ( 3L ) Exel8098 / TM6 , P { EPgy2 } Cip4 EY10134 , sop2 Q25st / CyO , scar D 37 FRT40A / CyO [ 24 ] , andDf ( 3R ) 3450 / TM6 , all available at the Bloomington Stock Center . The wsp 3 [ 32 ] allele was a gift fromE . Schejter . To determine the gain - and loss - of - function phenotypes of cip4 andWAVE , weusedtheUAS / GAL4system . Transgenicﬂiescarryingthe following constructs were generated according to standard procedures : UAS - Cip4 - EGFP , UAS - Cip4 D SH3 - EGFP , and UAS - Cip4 - RNAi . Forthe Cip4 - RNAi construct , cip4 codingsequencesfrom + 1084to + 1433 , containing no repetitive sequence motives , were cloned as an inverted repeat into pWIZ [ 33 ] . Several independent transgenic lines were analyzed Cip4 / Toca - 1 Couples Membrane and Actin Dynamics 1435 in each case . Additional RNAi lines were provided by the Vienna Drosophila RNAiCenter ( VDRC ) forCip4 ( + 278to + 778 ) , Abi ( + 292to + 792 ) , WASP ( + 434 to + 773 ) , WAVE ( + 4 to + 504 and + 1 to + 745 ) , and Arp2 / 3 components ( Arp2 , + 706 to + 1013 ; p34 , + 24 to 448 ) . For the suppression of cdc42 and shibire function , dominant - negative alleles ( UAS Cdc42 N17 , UAS Shi 1ts , Blooming - ton Stock Center ) were expressed under the control of engrailed GAL4 combined with a temperature - sensitive tubPGal80 ts transgene . To induce expression , we shifted ﬂies to 31 (cid:2) C at the indicated time points . Clones were recovered from wings of pupae of the following genotypes : ubx ﬂp , cdc42 3 , FRT19A / tubPGal80 , and FRT19A ; daGAL4 UAS CD8 : : EGFP / + ( gift from Y . Bellaiche ) . Puriﬁcation of Recombinant Proteins and Antibody Production Rabbit and guinea pig anti - Cip4 antibodies were generated against a GST - Cip4 fusion protein ( Biolabs ) . His - WASP protein was in vitro translated from a wheat germ lysate system ( RTS , Roche ) and subsequently puriﬁed with Ni - NTA columns . In Vitro Reconstitution of Membrane Interactions of CIP4 GST - CIP4 fusion proteins and GST were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with liposomes dotted with 5 % Rhodamine B - conjugated Phosphoetanolamine ( 1 m M protein / 1 mM liposomes ) in a Lumox 24 - well plate . The samples were then analyzed for tubule induction by live micros - copy ( Olympus IX81 F2 ) . Images were acquired and processed by Cell soft - ware from Olympus . Actin Polymerization Assay The actin polymerization assay was performed with the Actin Polymeriza - tion Biochem Kit ( Cytoskeleton ) as previously described [ 12 ] . Figure 5 . Block of Endocytosis and Vesicle Scission Induces Multiple Wing Hairs ( A – E ) Female adult wings ( left ) and higher magniﬁcation of a deﬁned region of the wing ( right ) . ( A ) Wild - type wing is shown . ( B ) Expression of a temperature - sensitive , dominant - negative Dynamin ( shi ts ) in the posterior compartment of the wing ( with the anterior compartment as a control ) was induced in third - instar larvae at the restrictive temperature of 31 (cid:2) . ( C ) Inactivation of Dynamin activity at the L3 laval stage results in a dramatic induction of wing hairs ( up to 10 – 20 per cells ) , whereas block of Dynamin function at 26 hr APF leads to milder wing hair duplication . ( D ) Expression of a full - length Cip4 protein rarely induces duplicated winghairs , whereas ( E ) astronginduction ofmultiplewinghairs canbe alsoobservedupon expression of themutant Cip4protein lacking the SH3 domain . ( F ) Model of Cip4 function in sequential endocytic steps . Cip4 promotes membrane invagination ( F 1 ) . This early step is essential for endocytosis . After membrane invagination , Cip4 recruits Dynamin to promote the scission of endocytic pits ( F 2 ) . WAVE - mediated actin polymerization has a supportive func - tioninvesiclebudding ( F 3 ) . Lossofanactin - basedstabilizingscaffoldnotonlyresultsinareducedvesiclemotility ( F 4 ) butalsoaffectsmembranescission . A block of both processes , loss of membrane invagination mediated by Cip4 and decreased membrane scission due to the loss of the membrane - associated actin cytoskeleton induced by WAVE , results in stronger endocytosis defects . Current Biology Vol 19 No 17 1436 Immunostaining and Antibodies Immunohistochemistry was performed as described [ 12 ] . Antibodies were used as follows : afﬁnity - puriﬁed anti - Cip4 polyclonal antibody , 1 : 100 ; guinea piganti - WASP , 1 : 500 [ 12 ] ; guineapig anti - WAVE , 1 : 1000 [ 12 ] ; guinea pig anti - Abi , 1 : 500 ( this work ) ; anti - Kette , 1 : 1000 [ 34 ] ; and anti - Dynamin , 1 : 200 ( BD Biosciences ) . Yeast Two - Hybrid Assay To test the interaction between Cip4 , WASP , WAVE , and Abi , we used the GBK - T7 and GAD - T7 vector system and Yeast Two - Hybrid System 3 ( CLONTECH ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions ( CLONTECH ) . Cloning details are provided upon request . GST - Pull - Down , Coimmunoprecipitation , and Flotation Experiment An excess of GST - Cip4 protein was immobilized on glutathione resin ac - cording the manufacturer’s instructions ( GE Healthcare ) . For GST - Cdc42 pull - downs , the immobilized GST proteins were pretreated with either 1 mM GDP or 1 mM GTP g S plus 25 mM MgCl 2 supplement for 10 min at 30 (cid:2) C . Coimmunoprecipitations were performed as described [ 12 ] . We frac - tionated postnuclear supernatants ( PNS ) from transfected S2 cells by isopycnic centrifugation on adiscontinuous sucrose density gradient ( ﬂota - tion ) as described previously [ 34 ] .
