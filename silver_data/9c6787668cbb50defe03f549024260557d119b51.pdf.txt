Ets - 1 DNA - binding is governed by an intramolecular mechanism called autoinhibition . Ets - 1 increases its DNA - binding afﬁn - ity by counteracting autoinhibition through binding either to a particular organization of Ets binding sites ( EBS ) in palindrome , as in the Stromelysin - 1 promoter , or to EBS adjacent to DNA - binding sites of its part - ners by combinatorial interactions , as in the Collagenase - 1 promoter . Identiﬁcation of new Ets - 1 interac - tion partners should allow the identiﬁcation of new functions for this transcription factor . To this end , we fused a biotin tag to Ets - 1 protein in order to copurify it and its partners by afﬁnity . For the ﬁrst time , we cloned , produced in Escherichia coli and puriﬁed a biotinylated recombinant Ets - 1 protein using the T7 - Impact TM system ( New England Biolabs (cid:2) ) , adapted to induce biotinylation . Nearly 100 % biotinylation was attained without altering Ets - 1 properties . Biotinylated Ets - 1 bound to and transactivated the Strom - elysin - 1 promoter the same way as native Ets - 1 did . It also conserved interactions with known Ets - 1 part - ners such as c - Jun , Erk - 2 and Runx - 1 . In addition , streptavidin pull - down and surface plasmon resonance assays demonstrated that biotinylated Ets - 1 is a useful tool for qualitative and quantitative studies of Ets - 1 interaction with its partners .

Introduction Ets - 1 is the founding member of the Ets family of transcription factors , which are characterized by a well - conserved DNA - binding domain ( DBD ) , 1 called the ETS domain . It recognizes speciﬁc DNA elements , called Ets binding sites ( EBS ) , that are present in promot - ers of target genes [ 1 , 2 ] . By binding to these elements , Ets - 1 activates the transcription of various genes involved in a range of processes , including development , angiogenesis , tumor invasion and apoptosis [ 3 ] . DNA - binding of Ets - 1 is governed by an intramolecular mecha - nism , called autoinhibition , associated with the existence of two inhibitory domains which ﬂank and interact with the ETS domain [ 4 , 5 ] . Therefore , Ets - 1 increases its DNA - binding afﬁnity by counter - acting autoinhibition through combinatorial interactions with cofac - tors at adjacent DNA elements [ 1 , 2 ] . For instance , Ets - 1 is recruited cooperatively with AP - 1 transcription factors ( c - Fos / c - Jun ) to EBS adjacent to the AP - 1 site in the Collagenase - 1 ( MMP - 1 ) promoter . Ets - 1 can also bind cooperatively with the Runx - 1 transcription fac - tor to EBS adjacent to the Runx - 1 binding site contained in the T - cell receptor ( TCR ) b promoter [ 6 – 8 ] . Interestingly , Ets - 1 can act as its own partner as demonstrated with an EBS palindrome found in the Stromelysin - 1 ( MMP - 3 ) promoter [ 5 , 9 ] . We showed that , at these sites , Ets - 1 overcomes autoinhibition through cooperative binding that leads to the formation of a ternary Ets - 1 – DNA – Ets - 1 complex [ 5 ] . Autoinhibition is a mechanism that increases transcrip - tion factor speciﬁcity because autoinhibited proteins require interac - tion with partners or particular conﬁgurations of binding sites to regulate transcription . On that basis , studying and identifying Ets - 1 partners are essential for understanding the mechanism of action of Ets - 1 , for detecting new target promoters and for discovering new functions . Until now , Ets - 1 interaction partners such as Runx - 1 [ 8 ] , Ubc - 9 [ 10 ] , USF - 1 [ 11 ] and EAPII [ 12 ] have primarily been identiﬁed through yeast two - hybrid or GST pull - down experiments but these techniques have drawbacks . It is now well known that detecting protein – protein interactions using yeast two - hybrid screening does not prove that this interaction actually occurs and further experiments are required before the putative interaction can be 1046 - 5928 / $ - see front matter (cid:3) 2008 Elsevier Inc .

In a GST pull - down assay , fusion of the GST tag ( 220 amino acids ) to the protein of interest may change the protein’s conformation due to the tag’s large size and to its ability to form dimers [ 14 , 15 ] . Consequently , the GST tag could alter protein prop - erties . This poses a real problem for Ets - 1 due to its particular auto - inhibited structure . To study interactions between Ets - 1 and its partners , Ets - 1 must be fused to a tag that does not alter the protein’s properties and that can be tightly bound to any solid support so that interaction partners can be copuriﬁed by afﬁnity under various conditions . To that aim , the streptavidin / biotin system offers several advanta - ges [ 16 ] . The biotin tag is very small ( 16 amino acids ) , decreasing the chance of altering fusion protein conformation [ 17 ] . Moreover , the non - covalent streptavidin / biotin interaction is one of the strongest ones known in nature ( K D = 10 (cid:2) 15 M ) [ 18 ] . Therefore , biotinylated recombinant proteins bound to a streptavidin resin can be subjected to very stringent conditions that allow copuriﬁca - tion of interaction partners . The biotin tag contains a lysine residue ; biotin is covalently attached to this lysine residue by a protein - biotin ligase . The bacterial BirA enzyme is the most commonly used exogenous biotin ligase [ 19 ] . Biotinylation systems using co - expression of tagged recombi - nant proteins and BirA biotin ligase were previously described . For instance , two prokaryotic proteins ( TufB , GyrA ) as well as two eukaryotic nuclear receptors ( GR , SHP ) fused to a multi afﬁnity tag including a biotin tag were biotinylated in Escherichia coli by the exogenously expressed BirA biotin ligase before being puriﬁed for subsequent experiments [ 20 ] . In mouse erythroleukemic ( MEL ) cells , stable transfection of vectors encoding GATA - 1 transcription factor fused to a biotin tag and BirA biotin ligase allowed expres - sion of biotinylated GATA - 1 directly in cells [ 21 , 22 ] . To date , Ets - 1 has never been biotinylated . In this study , we developed a pro - karyotic system of recombinant protein biotinylation , potentially applicable to various proteins . This system can easily be imple - mented and should facilitate the study of protein partner interac - tions , present in numerous cellular environments . We cloned , produced and puriﬁed biotinylated Ets - 1 protein using the T7 - Impact TM System ( New England Biolabs (cid:2) ) adapted to induce biotinylation . Biotinylation reached nearly 100 % without altering Ets - 1 properties : neither DNA - binding , transactivation nor partner recruitment properties were affected . In addition , pull - down and surface plasmon resonance ( SPR ) assays were per - formed to check and validate the usefulness of biotinylated Ets - 1 for the study of interactions between Ets - 1 and its partners .

Resulting puriﬁed biotinylated Ets - 1 solution ( lane 1 ) ( 50 l l ) was incubated and initially precipitated with 25 l l of streptavidin beads ( lane 4 ) . The resulting supernatant ( lane 2 ) was once again incubated and precipitated with 25 l l of streptavidin beads ( lane 5 ) and ﬁnal supernatant ( lane 3 ) was recovered . Beads and supernatants were analyzed by SDS – PAGE followed by Coomassie blue staining . C . Laitem et al . / Protein Expression and Puriﬁcation 62 ( 2008 ) 53 – 63 57 Results Biotinylated Ets - 1 production system A biotinylation tag , which has been reported to be efﬁciently biotinylated [ 17 , 23 ] , was added to the N - terminal end of the hu - man Ets - 1 protein to form the fusion protein , referred to here as tagged Ets - 1 . Tagged Ets - 1 was then biotinylated on the lysine res - idue of the tag by E . coli BirA biotin ligase to form biotinylated Ets - 1 [ 24 ] . Biotinylated Ets - 1 was obtained using the protein production T7 - Impact TM system ( New England Biolabs (cid:2) ) adapted to induce bio - tinylation . For this purpose , a pTyb2 - tag - Ets - 1 vector was con - structed to express the tagged protein and a pCY216 - BirA vector was used to encode E . coli BirA biotin ligase ( Fig . 1A ) [ 25 ] . A pTyb2 - tag - Ets - 1 vector was made by inserting ( i ) the se - quence tag into the NdeI – NotI digested pTyb2 vector ( New England Biolabs (cid:2) ) to produce a pTyb2 - tag vector , followed by ( ii ) the 1 . 3 kb NotI – SfoI digested human Ets - 1 cDNA into the NotI – SmaI digested pTyb2 - tag vector . Protein expression in the pTyb2 vector is controlled by a T7 promoter which is repressed by a lac - tose repressor encoded by the LacI gene [ 26 ] . Therefore , addition of IPTG is necessary to induce protein expression . Another character - istic of the pTyb2 vector is the presence of intein and chitin binding domain ( CBD ) genes in - frame with the Ets - 1 encoding sequence . After IPTG induction , the pTyb2 - tag - Ets - 1 vector produced tagged Ets - 1 protein fused C - terminally to an intein / CBD peptide . To favor biotinylation , this protein was coexpressed in bacteria with E . coli BirA biotin ligase encoded by the pCY216 - BirA vector . The latter is under the control of araBAD promoter and , therefore , requires arabinose induction for protein synthesis [ 27 ] .

Luciferase activity , measured 48 h after transfection , is expressed as the percentage of WT construct activity . Results are the average of two representative experiments done in triplicates . Cell lysates ( 25 l l ) were analyzed by Western blot using anti - Ets - 1 and anti - Erk - 2 ( as loading control ) antibodies and by streptavidin – HRP assay . 58 C . Laitem et al . / Protein Expression and Puriﬁcation 62 ( 2008 ) 53 – 63 on a chitin bead afﬁnity column ( Fig . 1B ) . The protein was retained through interaction of CBD with chitin beads and biotinylated Ets - 1 ( 56 kDa ) was released by intein - mediated self - cleavage through addition of a reducing agent ( DTT ) in elution buffer [ 28 , 29 ] . Expression and puriﬁcation of biotinylated Ets - 1 Bacteria , cotransformed with the pTyb2 - tag - Ets - 1 and pCY216 - BirA vectors , were maintained in catabolic repression with glucose in order to avoid inducer - independent expression . Synthesis of biotinylated Ets - 1 fused to the intein / CBD peptide was then acti - vated in bacteria , also called induced bacteria , by changing the medium to one containing IPTG , arabinose and biotin , but not glu - cose . Uninduced bacteria , the negative control of the reaction , were cultured under the same conditions in medium without inducers ( Fig . 2A ) . Bacteria cultures were then assessed for protein expres - sion by SDS – PAGE followed by Coomassie blue staining . Imple - menting our biotinylation Ets - 1 production system showed that induced bacteria ( Fig . 2A , lane 2 ) , compared to uninduced bacteria ( Fig . 2A , lane 1 ) , synthesize a protein ( indicated by arrow 1 ) that had the expected molecular mass ( 106 kDa ) . This protein was also detected by Western blot with an anti - Ets - 1 antibody and also by a streptavidin horseradish peroxidase ( streptavidin – HRP ) assay that is commonly used to detect biotinylated proteins . These results indicated that biotinylated Ets - 1 fused to the intein / CBD peptide was indeed expressed in induced bacteria . A 55 kDa protein was also detected with the anti - Ets - 1 antibody ( arrow 2 in Fig . 2A ) . Due to its presence in both uninduced and induced bacteria , this protein probably resulted from an antibody cross - reaction with a bacterial protein . Biotinylated Ets - 1 fused to the intein / CBD peptide ( 106 kDa ) was then puriﬁed on a chitin bead afﬁnity column , as described above , and elution fractions were assessed for recovery of puriﬁed biotinylated Ets - 1 ( 56 kDa ) . Analysis of the eight elution fractions of puriﬁed biotinylated Ets - 1 by SDS – PAGE followed by Coomassie blue staining , Western blot for Ets - 1 detection and streptavidin – HRP assay ( Fig . 2B , lanes 1 – 8 ) revealed that all fractions contained 56 kDa biotinylated Ets - 1 protein ( arrow 3 , Fig . 2B ) . A 70 - kDa pro - tein , detected by Coomassie blue staining and indicated by arrow 4 , was identiﬁed after protein N - terminal sequencing ( data not shown ) as DnaK protein , a bacterial analog of the human HSP - 70 chaperon [ 30 ] . DnaK protein is frequently copuriﬁed with recombi - nant proteins in bacteria and is known to improve their solubility . All elution fractions containing puriﬁed biotinylated Ets - 1 were pooled and the yield of puriﬁcation was estimated by SDS – PAGE followed by Coomassie blue staining ( Table 1 ) . After comparison against known protein standards ( bovine serum albumin ) , the yield of biotinylated Ets - 1 fused to the intein / CBD peptide ex - pressed in induced bacteria lysate was estimated to 20 mg / l and the yield of puriﬁed biotinylated Ets - 1 to 9 . 6 mg / l ( 48 % recovery ) . Despite an excess of chitin beads , approximately 7 . 4 mg / l ( 37 % ) of biotinylated Ets - 1 fused to the intein / CBD peptide were recov - ered in the ﬂow - through after passing the induced bacteria lysate on the chitin bead afﬁnity column . Biotinylated Ets - 1 fused to the intein / CBD peptide was mainly lost at this step , and only a small fraction was trapped in bacteria or retained on the column , due to its insensitivity to intein - mediated self - cleavage . Afterwards , the biotinylation yield of puriﬁed Ets - 1 was as - sessed by two successive pull - down assays with streptavidin beads using pooled elution fractions containing puriﬁed biotinylated Ets - 1 ( Fig . 2C ) . Analysis of supernatants and beads by SDS – PAGE fol - lowed by Coomassie blue staining showed that almost all of the puriﬁed 56 kDa protein , contained in pooled elution fractions , ( Fig . 2C , lane 1 ) was bound to the streptavidin beads ( Fig . 2C , lane 4 ) after the ﬁrst incubation . The remaining puriﬁed 56 kDa pro - teins in the supernatant ( Fig . 2C , lane 2 ) were precipitated after the second incubation with streptavidin beads ( Fig . 2C , lane 5 ) , conﬁrming their biotinylation . The ﬁnal supernatant ( Fig . 2C , lane 3 ) was completely depleted of proteins . This result clearly demon - strates that nearly 100 % of the puriﬁed 56 kDa protein was biotinylated . Biotinylated Ets - 1 conserves Ets - 1 DNA - binding and transactivation properties DNA - binding and transactivation properties of biotinylated Ets - 1 were assessed and compared to those of native Ets - 1 . For this purpose , we used the matrix metalloproteinase Stromelysin - 1 pro - moter since it is known to be regulated by Ets - 1 [ 31 ] . Our previous work showed that this promoter contains an EBS palindrome to which two molecules of autoinhibited Ets - 1 cooperatively bind , forming an Ets - 1 - DNA - Ets - 1 ternary complex , which is optimal for promoter transactivation [ 5 ] . Electrophoretic mobility shift as - says ( EMSA ) were thus carried out using Ets - 1 or biotinylated Ets - 1 proteins and 30 - mer 32 P - labeled DNA probes containing wild - type or mutant EBS palindromes of the Stromelysin - 1 promoter . Mutant probes were designed to harbor either one ( M1 , M2 ) or both ( M1M2 ) EBS consensus cores that were inactivated by exchanging the 5 0 - GGAA - 3 0 sequence with 5 0 - AAAA - 3 0 and the 5 0 - TTCC - 3 0 se - quence with 5 0 - TTTT - 3 0 ( Fig . 3A ) . Results from the EMSA on native and biotinylated Ets - 1 showed that both native and biotinylated Ets - 1 formed a ternary complex on the wild - type EBS palindrome ( Fig . 3B , lanes 2 and 6 ) , while mutation of one ( M1 , M2 ) or both ( M1M2 ) EBS prevented Ets - 1 from forming DNA – protein com - plexes ( Fig . 3B , lanes 3 – 5 and 7 – 9 ) . In both cases , these complexes were predominantly disrupted by a 800 (cid:3) molar excess of WT non - labeled DNA probe ( Fig . 3C , lanes 3 and 6 ) but not by a 800X molar excess of M1M2 non - labeled DNA probe ( Fig . 3C , lanes 4 and 7 ) , conﬁrming the complexes’ speciﬁcity for the EBS palindrome . To conﬁrm that DNA - binding properties of biotinylated Ets - 1 correlate with the transcriptional control of Stromelysin - 1 pro - moter the same way as Ets - 1 does , gene reporter assays were per - formed using both Ets - 1 and biotinylated Ets - 1 . To express biotinylated Ets - 1 in eukaryotic cells , the following sequences were cloned into the pcDNA3 expression vector : ( i ) tagged Ets - 1 and ( ii ) BirA biotin ligase . Cotransfection of both expression vectors ( tagged Ets - 1 and BirA biotin ligase ) in human embryonic kidney ( HEK ) 293 cells allowed the expression of biotinylated Ets - 1 , as re - vealed by Western blot and streptavidin – HRP assays ( Fig . 3D , lanes 5 – 8 ) . Vectors expressing Ets - 1 or biotinylated Ets - 1 were used to perform transactivation assays by transient transfection experi - ments in HEK - 293 cells in the presence of either wild - type ( WT ) or mutant ( M1 , M2 , M1M2 ) Stromelysin - 1 promoter reporter pGL3 vectors . Mutations of the EBS palindrome of the Stromely - sin - 1 promoter were similar to those described for EMSA assays ( Fig . 3A ) . Normalized activities showed that biotinylated Ets - 1 ( Fig . 3D , lanes 5 – 8 ) , as well as Ets - 1 ( Fig . 3D , lanes 1 – 4 ) , activated the Stromelysin - 1 promoter containing the wild - type EBS palin - drome ( Fig . 3D , lanes 1 and 5 ) . Mutation of one ( M1 , M2 ) or both ( M1M2 ) EBS had dramatic effects on transactivation , resulting in a 80 % loss of activity in both cases ( Fig . 3D , lanes 2 – 4 and 6 – 8 ) .

C . Laitem et al . / Protein Expression and Puriﬁcation 62 ( 2008 ) 53 – 63 59 Analysis of cell lysates by Western blot for Ets - 1 and Erk - 2 ( loading control ) detection and by streptavidin – HRP assay showed that both Ets - 1 and biotinylated Ets - 1 were expressed at the same lev - els under the different experimental conditions . Thus , biotinylated Ets - 1 conserves the Ets - 1 DNA - binding and transactivation proper - ties on the Stromelysin - 1 promoter . Recruitment of interaction partners by biotinylated Ets - 1 Since biotinylated Ets - 1 was mainly produced to study Ets - 1 partners , we investigated whether biotinylation affects interaction of Ets - 1 with known partners , such as c - Jun [ 32 , 33 ] , Erk - 2 [ 34 , 35 ] and Runx - 1 [ 8 ] . To perform this study , cell lines known to express these proteins were used : ( i ) HIG - 82 synovial ﬁbroblastic cells for c - Jun and Erk - 2 and ( ii ) Jurkat acute leukemia T cells for Runx - 1 [ 8 , 36 ] . Ets - 1 or biotinylated Ets - 1 incubated with cell lysates were puriﬁed , using coimmunoprecipitation assays , via an anti - Ets - 1 antibody on a protein A bead afﬁnity column ( Fig . 4A ) . Western blot analysis of the eluted material showed that biotinylated Ets - 1 ( Fig . 4A , lane 3 ) interacted with c - Jun , Erk - 2 and Runx - 1 the same way as Ets - 1 did ( Fig . 4A , lane 2 ) . More interestingly , biotinylated Ets - 1 could be used directly for qualitative studies of Ets - 1 interaction partners using pull - down assays with streptavidin beads , with cell lysates previously incu - bated with biotinylated Ets - 1 ( Fig . 4B ) . Western blot analysis of proteins bound to streptavidin beads showed results similar to those of the coimmunoprecipitation experiment , namely that bio - tinylated Ets - 1 , and therefore Ets - 1 , was copuriﬁed with c - Jun , Erk - 2 and Runx - 1 ( Fig . 4B , lane 2 ) . However , the biotinylation method has a major advantage over coimmunoprecipitation : the pull - down assay is a rapid and single - step experiment where a high quantity of interaction partners can be puriﬁed . Thus , biotinylated Ets - 1 constitutes a relevant and useful tool for direct and qualita - tive study of Ets - 1 interaction partners . Biotinylated Ets - 1 , a reliable tool for kinetic studies of Ets - 1 interaction with partners by SPR experiments Biotinylated Ets - 1 can also be used to perform kinetic studies of interactions between Ets - 1 and its partners by surface plasmon resonance ( SPR ) experiments . We investigated the interaction of Ets - 1 with Erg - 1 and Fli - 1 ( other Ets family members ) known as Ets - 1 partners [ 37 ] . For this purpose , biotinylated Ets - 1 was ﬁxed on a streptavidin Sensor Chip ( Fig . 5A ) and subjected to a constant ﬂux of interest proteins ( Fig . 5B ) . SPR measurements were quanti - ﬁed using RU signal intensity , which is representative of mass var - iation at the surface of the Sensor Chip : 1 , 000 RU corresponds to a variation of 1 ng / mm 2 at the surface . In the SPR experiment , 4000 RU of biotinylated Ets - 1 were ﬁxed on the streptavidin Sensor Chip ; we therefore estimated that 71 . 4 fmol of biotinylated Ets - 1 were bound per mm 2 ( Fig . 5A ) . Due to the strong interaction be - tween biotin and streptavidin , almost no drift was detected during SPR measurements at the end of injection ( indicated by the arrow in Fig . 5A ) , demonstrating the real advantage of biotinylated Ets - 1 for ﬂux studies using Biacore (cid:2) technology . The desired concentrations of Erg - 1 and Fli - 1 proteins were then injected over the Sensor Chip functionalized with biotinylated Ets - 1 ( Fig . 5B ) . The sensorgrams shown in Fig . 5B were corrected by subtracting the blank curve corresponding to the ﬂow cell without biotinylated Ets - 1 . Injection of the desired concentrations of Erg - 1 and Fli - 1 showed that Erg - 1 and Fli - 1 interacted with biotinylated Ets - 1 in a dose - dependent manner . Kinetic analysis ( Fig . 5C ) re - vealed that the dissociation constant at equilibrium ( K D ) for Fli - 1 ( 23 . 4 nM ) was weaker than for Erg - 1 ( 89 . 3 nM ) , indicating that Fli - 1 had a higher afﬁnity for Ets - 1 . Moreover , the association con - stant ( k a ) was greater for Fli - 1 than for Erg - 1 , whereas their disso - ciation constants ( k d ) were roughly equivalent . We can conclude that the higher afﬁnity of Fli - 1 compared to Erg - 1 is due to its fas - ter association with Ets - 1 . Biotinylated Ets - 1 has thus proved to be a useful tool for kinetic analyses of Ets - 1 interaction with its part - ners . This kind of tool will not only allow the construction of a map of the preferential partners of Ets - 1 , but will also provide quantita - tive data on speciﬁc interactions . Discussion Ets - 1 is autoinhibited for its DNA - binding . DNA - binding afﬁnity is increased by counteracting autoinhibition by ( i ) binding to EBS in a particular palindrome organization , as in the Stromelysin - 1 promoter , or ( ii ) interacting in combination with cofactors at adja - anti - c - Jun anti - Erk - 2 anti - Ets - 1 c on t r o l E t s - 1 b i o t i n y l a t ed E t s - 1 HIG - 82 HIG - 82 anti - c - Jun anti - Erk - 2 c on t r o l b i o t i n y l a t ed E t s - 1 anti - Runx - 1 anti - Runx - 1 Jurkat anti - Ets - 1 HIG - 82 HIG - 82 Jurkat 1 2 3 1 2 Fig . 4 .

Ets - 1 and biotinylated Ets - 1 associated complexes were then puriﬁed on a protein A bead ( 100 l l ) afﬁnity column via an anti - Ets - 1 antibody ( 20 l g ) . Beads were washed 30 min later and eluted with a low pH buffer .

Beads were washed 1 h later and boiled in Laemmli buffer to detect presence of Ets - 1 , c - Jun , Erk - 2 and Runx - 1 by Western blot using anti - Ets - 1 , anti - c - Jun , anti - Erk - 2 and anti - Runx - 1 antibodies . 60 C . Laitem et al . / Protein Expression and Puriﬁcation 62 ( 2008 ) 53 – 63 cent DNA elements , as in the Collagenase - 1 promoter . Thus , the study of Ets - 1 interaction partners is essential for understanding its mechanism of action . This kind of study requires the use of Ets - 1 fused to a tag so that it can be copuriﬁed with its interaction partners . Due to its small size , the biotin tag should not alter Ets - 1 properties . Further , because of the strong interaction between bio - tin and streptavidin , subsequent puriﬁcations can be assessed in various conditions . For the ﬁrst time , we developed a strategy to produce a biotinylated recombinant Ets - 1 protein in E . coli . To do so , we adapted the native recombinant T7 - Impact TM protein expres - sion system ( New England Biolabs (cid:2) ) to induce biotinylation . The principle of this system is to express , through a pTyb2 vector , the protein of interest fused to an intein / chitin binding domain peptide in order to purify the recombinant protein on a chitin bead afﬁnity column and elute the protein of interest by intein - mediated self - cleavage . Our adaptations to induce biotinylation included ( i ) clon - ing the sequence tag in - frame along with Ets - 1 cDNA into a pTyb2 vector in order to synthesize tagged Ets - 1 and ( ii ) coexpressing BirA biotin ligase with tagged Ets - 1 in E . coli in order to ensure efﬁ - cient biotinylation ( Fig . 1 ) . Despite the presence of endogenous biotin ligase in E . coli , expression of an exogenous enzyme im - proves biotinylation efﬁciency , as illustrated the 100 % biotinyla - tion yield that we obtained . This production system offered a high levels of expression of biotinylated Ets - 1 fused to an intein / CBD peptide in induced bacteria lysate ( 20 mg from 1 l of culture ) with considerable recovery ( 48 % ) of puriﬁed biotinylated Ets - 1 ( 9 . 6 mg ; Table 1 ) . Only one contaminant was recovered in elution fractions ( Fig . 2 ) , corresponding to DnaK , a bacterial analog of the human HSP - 70 chaperon [ 30 ] . DnaK is often copuriﬁed with re - combinant proteins expressed in E . coli and is known to improve their solubility [ 38 ] . Nevertheless , since DnaK is not biotinylated , it will not interfere with subsequent experiments , that involve streptavidin / biotin interaction . This system has three major advantages : ( i ) it is easily applica - ble to various proteins and different isoforms of a given protein ; ( ii ) the biotinylated protein , expressed in E . coli , is not post - transla - tionally modiﬁed , and thereby allows the action of recombinant enzymes to control the protein state in vitro ; and ( iii ) the straight - forward production of biotinylated proteins can be used to rapidly screen numerous nuclear extracts or whole - cell lysates to purify interaction partners through their afﬁnity for Ets - 1 . Therefore , this system is a powerful tool for a rapid analysis of the different states of both interaction partners , i . e . the protein of interest in , for exam - ple , various post - translational states , and its partner , in various culture conditions and cell types . In the course of this study , we showed that biotinylated Ets - 1 produced with this system conserves the Ets - 1 DNA - binding and transactivation properties on the Stromelysin - 1 promoter ( Fig . 3 ) . Biotinylated Ets - 1 cooperatively bound to the EBS palindrome present in this promoter , forming a ternary complex . The forma - tion of this ternary complex , which counteracts Ets - 1 autoinhibi - tion , proves that biotinylated Ets - 1 is also autoinhibited for its DNA - binding . Conservation of the autoinhibited structure argues in favor of biotinylated Ets - 1 conformational integrity .

Kinetic analysis of biotinylated Ets - 1 interaction with Erg - 1 and Fli - 1 by SPR measurements . ( A ) Injection of biotinylated Ets - 1 ( 85 nM ) over a streptavidin Sensor Chip . The 4000 RU signal obtained corresponds to 71 . 4 fmol of biotinylated Ets - 1 bound per surface unit ( mm 2 ) . The arrow indicates the end of injection . ( B ) Sensorgrams illustrating real - time binding at various concentrations of Erg - 1 ( 22 . 5 , 45 , 90 , 180 and 360 nM ) or Fli - 1 ( 5 , 10 , 20 , 40 and 80 nM ) to the Sensor Chip functionalized with 4000 RU of biotinylated Ets - 1 protein . ( A and B ) A ﬂow cell without biotinylated Ets - 1 was used as a reference for nonspeciﬁc binding . Data are expressed as relative responses in resonance units ( RU ) after subtraction of the non - speciﬁc signal . ( C ) Parameters of biotinylated Ets - 1 interaction with Erg - 1 and Fli - 1 . Analysis was performed using BIA evaluation software 3 . 1 as described in Materials and methods section . C . Laitem et al . / Protein Expression and Puriﬁcation 62 ( 2008 ) 53 – 63 61 tutes strong evidence that biotinylated Ets - 1 conformation is not altered by the fusion of a biotin tag . In addition , biotinylated Ets - 1 interacted with c - Jun , Erk - 2 and Runx - 1 , which are known Ets - 1 partners ( Fig . 4A ) . Therefore , the biotinylated Ets - 1 , produced with this system , retained the properties of native Ets - 1 . Biotinyl - ated Ets - 1 thus constitutes a useful tool for experiments whose re - sults can be directly transposable to native Ets - 1 . In addition , since biotinylated Ets - 1 complexed with its interac - tion partners is efﬁciently precipitated with streptavidin beads ( Fig . 4B ) , biotinylated Ets - 1 can be used to directly perform quali - tative studies on Ets - 1 interaction partners . Pull - down assays can be carried out to identify new interaction partners by SDS – PAGE followed by Coomassie blue staining and mass spectrometry . Since it is tightly bound on streptavidin beads , biotinylated Ets - 1 is clearly adapted for these kinds of experiments and many stringent washing conditions can be tested , decreasing the occurrence of aspeciﬁc interactions on beads and thereby improving the likeli - hood that coeluted molecules are genuine interaction partners . Our results also demonstrated that biotinylated Ets - 1 is a useful tool , when compared to native Ets - 1 , for the quantitative analysis of interactions with its partners by SPR measurements ( Fig . 5 ) . Na - tive Ets - 1 can only be randomly immobilized onto the Sensor Chip by coupling lysine residues with the activated carboxyl groups of the Sensor Chip . The resulting surface is heterogeneous and , con - sidering the inefﬁcient linkage of Ets - 1 , is unfavorable for SPR experiments . Conversely , owing to the strong streptavidin / biotin interaction , biotinylated Ets - 1 efﬁciently binds to a streptavidin Sensor Chip in a speciﬁc orientation . The resulting surface is homogenous and , consequently , optimal for SPR measurements . Furthermore , owing to the strength of the streptavidin / biotin interaction , almost no drift due to molecule dissociation from the Sensor Chip could be detected even after several injections . Reten - tion of biotinylated Ets - 1 on the Sensor Chip was extensively tested during our experiments in which we subjected the Sensor Chip to various injections of Erg - 1 and Fli - 1 recombinant proteins in order to test the reproducibility of our results . The high reproducibility of our results demonstrates that interactions of Ets - 1 with various partners can be compared under exactly the same conditions . In conclusion , biotinylated Ets - 1 proved to be a powerful tool that conserves native Ets - 1 properties , providing an effective experi - mental system for qualitative and quantitative studies of Ets - 1 interaction with partners .
