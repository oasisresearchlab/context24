Since hormone status varies with individual physiological states , it is essential to understand the interplay of hormones and drugs for precision medicine . Here , we developed an in silico method to predict interactions between 283 human endogenous hormones and 590 drugs for 20 diseases including cancers and non - cancer diseases . We extracted hormone effect paths and drug effect paths from a large - scale molecular network that contains protein interactions , transcriptional regulations , and signaling interactions . If two kinds of effect paths for a hormone - drug pair intersect closely , we expect that the influence of the hormone on the drug efficacy is significant . It has been shown that the proposed method correctly distinguishes hormone - drug pairs with known interactions from random pairs in blind experiments . In addition , the method can suggest underlying interaction mechanisms at the molecular level so that it helps us to better understand the interplay of hormones and drugs . Hormone - drug interactions are crucial for drug treatment , thus sufficient understanding of relations between hormones and drugs is required . Numerous reports have concluded that hormones can change drug efficacy . For example , a group found that stress hormones ( e . g . cortisol , norepinephrine , and epinephrine ) significantly decrease the apoptotic efficacy of paclitaxel in triple - negative breast cancer cells by affecting DNA damage and cell cycle regulation 1 . In addition , another group observed that men and women with chronic depression showed different responses to treatment of sertraline and imipramine , and further reported that female sex hormones can improve response to sertraline and hinder response to imipramine 2 . However , only small part of hormone - drug pairs among an enormous number of hormones and drugs have been studied so far . Most of the previous studies have focused on only certain types of hormones ( especially stress hormones ) and drugs ( especially cancer - treating drugs ) . For the better understanding of relationships between hormones and drugs , we need a model that can systematically test all pairwise combinations of them . Most of the related previous studies have been performed through in vitro or in vivo based approaches , par - ticularly using cell lines because mainly studied drugs were cancer - treating drugs . For example , in an experi - ment to compare apoptotic cells with / without glucocorticoid pretreatment before chemotherapy of paclitaxel and doxorubicin respectively in breast cancer cell lines ( MCF - 7 and MDA - MB - 231 ) , it resulted that glucocorticoids constrain apoptosis induced by chemotherapy 3 . In vitro or in vivo based approaches are accurate and reliable , but they are not appropriate for screening whole pairwise combinations of hormones and drugs because they require high costs . Recently an in silico based approach was used for hormone and drug study . For example , in silico modeling was performed to uncover how epinephrine affects apoptosis - regulating mechanisms of eight prostate cancer drugs , using ordinary differential equations ( ODE ) 4 . They found that epinephrine activates anti - apoptotic signaling pathways and eventually decreases the chemotherapeutic efficacy of prostate cancer drugs . Parametric characteristics of quantitative models such as ODE models facilitate accurate network analysis but require opti - mization of numerous parameters . Thus , the performance of quantitative modeling is limited to small networks that should be determined by prior knowledge . However , the studies of hormones and drugs require comprehen - sive and large - scale networks because hormones can affect drug efficacy by inducing signaling crosstalk to drug mechanisms of action ( MOA ) in indirect ways as well as direct ways . For example , epinephrine causes distant 1 Department of Bio and Brain Engineering , KAIST , 291 Daehak - ro , Yuseong - gu , Daejeon , Republic of Korea . 2 Bio - Synergy Research Center , 291 Daehak - ro , Yuseong - gu , Daejeon , Republic of Korea . 3 Department of Applied Statistics , College of Economics and Business , The University of Suwon , Bongdam - eup , Hwaseong , Republic of Korea .

We thus need comprehensive and large - scale networks including MOA of drugs and their neighboring pathways . Large - scale and heterogene - ous networks have been frequently utilized to predict interactions between two entities . Some research groups inferred drug - target interactions by using heterogeneous networks consisting of three sub - networks whose edges represent drug - drug chemical structure similarity , target - target sequence similarity , and known drug - target inter - actions 5 , 6 . The models showed good performance for drug - target prediction problem , but they are not fit to pre - dict hormone - drug relations ( more exactly hormone impacts on drug efficacy ) . For example , hormones consist of non - steroid hormones such as peptide hormones as well as steroid hormones , which makes it hard to calculate chemical structure similarity between hormones . Here , we take advantage of large - scale networks to develop a new in silico model for screening the interplay of hormones and drugs . We aim to discover that hormones affecting drug efficacy under a specific disease condition . To this end , firstly we construct a biological network by collecting molecular interactions from public databases . Secondly , two kinds of paths for a hormone - drug pair are inferred : ( 1 ) drug effect paths and ( 2 ) hormone effect paths . Drug effect paths ( DEPs ) are defined as all possible shortest paths from each drug target to the nearest disease gene , which implies drug MOA . Hormone effect paths ( HEPs ) are defined as the shortest paths from hormone receptors to the nearest molecule of the DEPs , and HEPs possibly induce signaling crosstalk to drug MOA . Lastly , a scoring function is defined under the main assumption that a hormone whose receptors are closer to DEPs of a drug has higher potential to affect the drug efficacy than distant hormones . High - ranked but yet unknown hormone - drug pairs are suggested as candidates , and they are supported by their underlying mech - anisms of interference inferred by the proposed method . This approach is termed as a prediction of Hormone Impact on Drug Efficacy based on Effect Paths ( HIDEEP ) . We hope that this large - scale network - based approach will improve our understanding of crosstalks between a hormone and a drug . Results Data collection . A biological network consists of molecular interactions collected from three public data - bases : BioGRID 7 , KEGG pathways 8 , TRANSFAC 9 ( see Materials and methods ) . Total 192 , 232 of molecular inter - actions are collected , including 189 , 417 gene - gene interactions , 1 , 198 gene - compound interactions , and 1 , 617 compound - compound interactions between 16 , 744 genes and 1 , 487 compounds . We collect following data from public databases : 1 ) human endogenous hormones and their receptors from EndoNet 10 , 2 ) drug - disease associa - tions and disease - gene associations from comparative toxicogenomics database ( CTD ) 11 , 3 ) drug - target associa - tions from DrugBank 12 ( see Materials and methods ) . Hormones , drugs , and diseases respectively should have at least one receptor , target , and disease gene . As a result , 283 human hormones , 4 , 781 drugs , and 139 diseases are finally extracted . Disease selection . Twenty diseases are selected under three criteria for case studies : 1 ) the number of gold standard samples is three or more , 2 ) the number of disease genes is one or more , 3 ) various disease types are considered ( see Materials and methods ) . Among 4 , 881 diseases with one or more disease genes , 139 diseases with three or more gold standard samples are filtered . Highly ranked ones out of 139 diseases based on the number of gold standard samples are non - cancer disease types . Thus , fifteen high - ranked non - cancer diseases and extra five cancer diseases are determined as case study diseases . In this way , we choose final twenty diseases , avoiding bias to any certain disease type . Table 1 shows the selected twenty diseases and their number of gold standard samples , disease genes , and drugs . Drug effect paths . Drug effect paths ( DEPs ) , which imply drug MOA , are defined as the shortest paths from each drug target to the nearest disease - causing gene ( see Materials and methods ) . The biological network we con - struct does not include drugs as entities , thus DEPs start vicariously from drug targets . The length of each DEP is calculated by distance from a target to a disease gene . For example , the path length of a DEP consisting of three molecules becomes two . Drugs ultimately aim to affect disease genes either by physically bindings to them or by signal transduction via intermediate molecules . In the case of a drug physically binding to a disease gene as a drug target , the length of DEPs becomes zero . A drug may have different DEPs for different disease treatment because DEPs of a drug are determined by disease genes of each disease . Hormone effect paths . Hormone effect paths ( HEPs ) , which can cause signaling crosstalk on DEPs , are defined as the shortest paths from hormone receptors to molecules of DEPs ( see Materials and methods ) . The biological network we construct does not include hormones as entities , thus HEPs start vicariously from hor - mone receptors . A hormone has one or more receptors , and DEPs of a drug consist of one or more molecules . A hormone - drug pair , thus , has receptor - molecule pairwise combinations and each receptor - molecule pair can have the different shortest paths with a different length . Thus , HEPs become the very shortest paths among the all possible shortest paths . HEPs may impact on upstream ( e . g . drug target ) , downstream ( e . g . disease gene ) , or intermediate molecules of DEPs , which results in signaling crosstalk on DEPs . Scoring function . For a hormone - drug pair , a potential impact that the hormone has an intervention on the drug efficacy is evaluated by a scoring function defined under the following assumptions : 1 ) hormones whose receptors are closer to DEPs ( i . e . a hormone with shorter HEPs ) have a higher potential to affect the efficacy of drugs , 2 ) the more receptors of a hormone are involved in HEPs , the more the hormone affects the efficacy of the drug , 3 ) the more molecules of DEPs are involved in HEPs , the more the hormone affects the efficacy of the drug . For example , although two hormones A and B have the same number and length of HEPs for a drug , hormone A which has two receptors involved in HEPs is more likely to have impacts on the efficacy of the drug than hor - mone B which has only one receptor involved in HEPs . Likewise , although two hormones C and D have the same number and length of HEPs for a drug , hormone C which has two molecules of DEPs involved in HEPs is more www . nature . com / scientificreports / 3 Scientific REPORts | 7 : 16600 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41598 - 017 - 16855 - 8 likely to have impacts on the efficacy of the drug than hormone D which has only one molecule of DEPs involved in HEPs . Given h , a hormone , d , a drug , R ( h ) , the set of hormone receptors , M ( d ) , the set of molecules of DEPs , n ( S ) , the number of distinct start nodes ( i . e . receptors involved in HEPs ) , n ( E ) , the number of distinct end nodes ( i . e . molecules of DEPs involved in HEPs ) , we define a potential impact i . as equation ( 1 ) . α = × × − ∈ ∈ i h d n S n E ( , ) ( ) ( ) ( 1 ) d r m min ( , ) r Rm M d , ( ) where d ( r , m ) , the shortest path length from receptor r to molecule m and α , a decay constant . Thus , ∈ ∈ d r m min ( , ) r R h m M d ( ) , ( ) means a length of HEPs . When there is no HEPs for hormone h and drug d , the length of HEPs is represented by infinite and i ( h , d ) converges to zero . A hormone - drug pair whose n ( S ) or n ( E ) is higher has a stronger potential impact i . Model evaluation . For model evaluation , unlabeled hormone - drug pairs for each disease are randomly sam - pled from the human hormone set and the corresponding disease - treating drug set . A dataset for each disease consists of a gold standard set and an unlabeled set . In order to cover different areas of the search space , each disease has five datasets that consist of five different unlabeled sets sampled by multiple permutations . In addition , to show results for different sizes of unlabeled sets , we determine the five different sizes of unlabeled sets ( i . e . 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , and 10 times of the size of the corresponding gold standard sets ) ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . Thus , each disease has five datasets per size and totally 25 datasets for the five sizes . We analyze DEPs and HEPs for every hormone - drug pairs of gold standard sets and unlabeled sets . Every hormone - drug pair is scored by the scoring function . The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ( AUROC ) is used to evaluate how well this model distinguishes known hormone - drug pairs from random hormone - drug pairs . In order to calculate AUROC , we draw a Receiver operating characteristic ( ROC ) curve , whose x - axis is the false positive rate ( 1 - specificity ) and y - axis is the true positive rate ( sensitivity ) while varying threshold scores . In order to optimize a decay constant , α , we , first of all , apply HIDEEP to datasets with ‘10 times’ size and evaluate AUROC performance while varying α from two to ten . The performance continuously increases as α increases , but it reaches a saturation level at α = 8 ( AUROC 0 . 89 ) ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . Thus , α is determined as eight for model evaluation and performance comparison in this study . For each of the five different sizes , HIDEEP shows the same performance with AUROC 0 . 89 on average for 20 diseases although there are slight differences in individual diseases depending on the sizes ( Table 2 ) . Figure 1 shows AUROC per - formances for five datasets with size ‘10 times’ for each disease . ROC curves for 20 diseases per data size are also shown in Supplementary Figs 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , and 6 . We additionally evaluate model performance using the area under the precision - recall curve ( AUPR ) . The average AUPR for overall 20 diseases is 0 . 89 , 0 . 77 , 0 . 66 , 0 . 60 , and 0 . 55 respectively for five unlabeled set sizes ( 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , and 10 times of gold standard sets ) . Precision - recall curves for 20 diseases per data size are also shown in Supplementary Figs 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , and 11 . The every AUPR is over 0 . 77 or 0 . 5 for datasets with size ‘1 time’ or size ‘3 times’ . In order to validate the assumption that hormones whose receptors are closer to DEPs have a higher potential to affect the efficacy of drugs , we test how significantly short HEPs of gold standard samples are in comparison to HEPs of unlabeled samples . To this end , we analyze distributions of the average HEP lengths of a gold standard set and five unlabeled sets with ‘10 times’ size for each disease ( Supplementary Fig . 12 ) .

Performance evaluation for five datasets whose unlabeled sets are 10 times of the corresponding gold standard set . We evaluate performance for each disease using five datasets whose unlabeled sets are ‘10 times’ of the gold standard set .

Here , α , the decay constant , of the scoring function is 8 . www . nature . com / scientificreports / 5 Scientific REPORts | 7 : 16600 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41598 - 017 - 16855 - 8 t - test is used to estimate the significance of the difference between the average HEP lengths of two types of sample sets for a disease , and 18 out of 20 diseases result in less than p - value 0 . 01 ( Supplementary Table 2 ) . The average HEP lengths of a gold standard set and five unlabeled sets with ’10 times’ size for each disease are measured , and those for overall twenty diseases are on average 1 . 00 and 2 . 42 respectively ( Fig . 2a ) . The average HEP length of gold standard samples is less than that of unlabeled samples in every disease . In addition , we compare the per - centage of hormone - drug pairs whose HEP lengths are zero or one for a gold standard set and unlabeled sets for each disease ( Fig . 2b ) . The percentage of a gold standard set exceeds that of unlabeled sets in every disease . Compared to 34 . 93 % of unlabeled sets , 82 . 25 % of gold standard sets on average for twenty diseases have HEPs with length either zero or one . We further evaluate whether the proposed method , HIDEEP , still robustly performs when taking out some information from the network . There are unique 451 receptors for the 283 hormones : 428 receptors for only a single hormone , 17 receptors for two hormones , two receptors for three hormones , one receptor for four hor - mones , one receptor for seven hormones , and two receptors for eight hormones . We select top six receptors that have the most number of interacting hormones under the assumption that a receptor interacting with more hor - mones is more likely to be critical for the performance of the model : LTB4R2 and CYSLTR1 ( eight hormones ) , LTB4R ( seven hormones ) , NR3C1 ( four hormones ) , ADRA2A and CRHR2 ( three hormones ) . We reconstruct eight different networks where each of the top six receptors is removed ( case 1 – 6 ) , a network where the top three receptors are removed ( case 7 ) , and a network where the all top six receptors are all removed ( case 8 ) . The average AUROC value for 20 diseases is either 0 . 89 or 0 . 90 in every case , which shows that there is no big difference from the original case performing AUROC 0 . 89 for overall 20 diseases in every dataset size ( 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , and 10 times of gold standard sets ) . These results indicate that HIDEEP seems to be robust even when part of the information is hidden . Performance comparison . We compare the proposed method , HIDEEP , with a state - of - the - art method which is closely related to HIDEEP despite the fact that it was published to handle a slightly different problem , prediction of drug - drug interactions 13 . This study predicts pharmacodynamic drug - drug interactions through signaling propagation interference using the random walk with restart algorithm on molecular networks ( shortly called RWDDI ) . It uses network features only to define a scoring function and represents drugs with their receptor proteins , which makes it available to apply this model to our problem . We score gold standard sets and unlabeled sets with ‘10 times’ size for 20 diseases by RWDDI . Here , restarting probability of the random walker at each time step , r , is determined to 0 . 7 as it was in the original study . The average , minimum and maximum AUROC values of HIDEEP are respectively 0 . 89 ( all diseases ) , 0 . 74 ( diabetes mellitus , type 2 ) and 0 . 98 ( lung neoplasms ) , with standard deviation 0 . 0653 ( Fig . 3 ) . Whereas , the average , minimum and maximum AUROC values of RWDDI are respectively 0 . 84 ( all diseases ) , 0 . 59 ( breast neoplasms ) and 0 . 97 ( prostatic neoplasms ) , with standard deviation 0 . 0855 ( Supplementary Fig . 13 ) . Additionally , the average AUPR of RWDDI for overall 20 diseases is 0 . 44 while that of HIDEEP is 0 . 55 . These results show that HIDEEP is more robust for disease types compared to RWDDI . HIDEEP is compared with one other closely related method , prediction of drug - target interactions ( DTI ) , although it was developed to solve a slightly different problem 14 .

NBDTI requires only information of known DTIs to pre - dict new DTIs , which makes it available to apply this model to infer hormone - drug interactions . For performance comparison , we adopt the same evaluation strategy , 30 times of 10 - fold cross - validation used in NBDTI study . The 13 out of 20 diseases have ten or more positive samples , and the 13 diseases are selected . For cross - validation setup , we firstly generate ten folds using one out of five datasets that consist of gold standard sets and unlabeled sets with ‘10 times’ size . Each of the ten folds has an identical ratio of gold standard samples and unlabeled samples . One fold is taken for testing a model while the other nine folds are used for training the model if needed . This proce - dure is implemented repeatedly ten times , switching a target test fold . The previous sequence from generating ten folds to switching a test fold ten times is iterated 30 times . The previous whole process is identically applied to the all five datasets . The three methods ( NBDTI , RWDDI , and HIDEEP ) are tested with the same test folds for a fair comparison . Based on this cross - validation strategy , the average AUROC for 13 diseases is measured . HIDEEP shows the best performance at α = 8 among values from two to ten , which is consistent with the value of the alpha previously tuned by using all datasets ( Supplementary Table 3 ) . Figure 3 shows the result of performance compari - son . Firstly , the average , minimum and maximum AUROC values of NBDTI are respectively 0 . 57 ( all diseases ) , 0 . 5 Figure 3 . Performance comparison with two previous methods . The performance of HIDEEP ( pink ) , RWDDI ( light blue ) and NBDTI ( green ) for 13 diseases was evaluated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ( AUROC ) . For this performance comparison , we adopt an evaluation strategy , 30 times of 10 - fold cross validation used to evaluate NBDTI in the original study . HIDEEP , RWDDI and NBDTI are applied to five datasets consisting of a gold standard set and five unlabeled sets with ‘10 times’ for 13 diseases with 10 or more positive samples . Thus , each box includes 150 AUROC values for five datasets . www . nature . com / scientificreports / 7 Scientific REPORts | 7 : 16600 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41598 - 017 - 16855 - 8 ( hypertension , tachycardia , angina pectoris , heart failure , hypotension , seizures , hyperalgesia , postoperative compli - cations , diabetic nephropathies ) and 0 . 91 ( diabetes mellitus , type 2 ) . The average , minimum and maximum AUROC values of RWDDI are respectively 0 . 84 ( all diseases ) , 0 . 72 ( atrial fibrillation ) and 0 . 94 ( hypotension ) . Whereas , the average , minimum and maximum AUROC values of HIDEEP at α = 8 are respectively 0 . 88 ( all diseases ) , 0 . 74 ( dia - betes mellitus , type 2 ) , 0 . 97 ( hyperglycemia ) . The standard deviations of NBDTI , RWDDI , and HIDEEP are respec - tively 0 . 1216 , 0 . 0641 , and 0 . 0658 . The average AUPRs of RWDDI and NBDTI for overall 13 diseases are respectively 0 . 52 and 0 . 60 whereas that of HIDEEP is 0 . 58 . NBDTI shows random performance 0 . 5 for the nine of thirteen diseases . We figure out that NBDTI is a known drug - target ( or hormone - drug ) interaction - based approach and its characteristic is that only drugs ( or hormones ) with at least one target ( or drug ) can be inferred to interaction with other targets ( or drugs ) . That is , if either a hormone or a drug in a test pair is not included in the bipartite network , this pair is unavailable to be tested by NBDTI and has a score , zero . Unlike drug - target interactions , not many hormone - drug interactions have been revealed yet , and NBDIT is not appropriate to predict a problem that does not have sufficient positive samples such as hormone impacts on drug efficacy . Previous work reproduction . One previous study quantitatively modeled MOA of epinephrine and eight prostate cancer drugs by using ODE 4 . This ODE - based model could describe how epinephrine impacts on the drug actions . The eight drugs are inhibitors for molecules of signaling pathways which activates anti - apoptosis in prostate cancer . Because those inhibitors are not included in the drug list in this study , we further test the com - binations of epinephrine and two inhibitors ( BADS112A , LY294002 ) whose efficacy is the highest among eight inhibitors . First , as for the epinephrine - BADS112A pair , they figured out that while BADS112A inhibits BAD whose phosphorylated proteins have an anti - apoptotic function , epinephrine has the reverse action of BADS112A in the following way : epinephrine activates cAMP , cAMP activates PKA , and PKA activates BAD . HIDEEP results that BADS112A inhibits BAD and epinephrine has HEPs such as cAMP → PKA family → BAD ( Fig . 4a ) . The underlying mechanisms of epinephrine and BADS112A are exactly identical to the findings of the previous study . Second , as for the epinephrine - LY294002 pair , the previous study figured out that while LY294002 inhibits PI3K which activates BAD , epinephrine has the reverse action of LY294002 in the following ways : epinephrine activates cAMP , cAMP activates PKA , and PKA activates BAD . HIDEEP results that LY294002 has DEPs such as PI3K family → YWHAQ → BAD and epinephrine has a HEP such as TNF → YWHAQ ( Fig . 4b ) . They used indirect association between PI3K and BAD due to lack of molecular interaction information , but HIDEEP reveals more in detail that PI3K family has signal transduction to BAD via ‘YWHAQ’ 15 , 16 . In addition , HIDEEP infers that downstream signaling path of epinephrine induces signaling crosstalk on YWHAQ of DEPs of LY294002z and related findings are observed in previous studies 17 , 18 . We also examine hormone - drug pairs tested in the previous breast cancer study which is one of in vitro based study and which has a limitation to account for underlying mechanisms of interference 3 .

HIDEEP reveals that paclitaxel has DEPs such as MAPT → EGFR and MAP4 → FN1 and dexamethasone impacts on EGFR and FN1 via NR3C1 and ANXA1 respectively , which implies changes in the efficacy of paclitaxel 19 , 20 ( Fig . 4c ) . Furthermore , HIDEEP reveals that doxorubicin directly targets TOP2A , one of breast cancer - causing genes , and dexamethasone has impacts on TOP2A through HEPs such as ANXA1 → SUMO3 → TOP2A and NR0B1 → UBC → TOP2A ( Fig . 4d ) . These uncovered molecular relations of the DEPs and HEPs have been observed in previous studies 21 – 24 . Network analysis for top three diseases . For overall five data sizes , HIDEEP averagely best performs for hyperglycemia ( AUROC 0 . 98 ) , ovarian neoplasms ( AUROC 0 . 97 ) , and acute kidney injury ( AUROC 0 . 95 ) among twenty diseases , and we implement network analysis for hormone - drug pairs on high ranks for the three diseases in order to help us better understand the interplay between hormones and drugs . To this end , for each disease we select maximum three hormone - drug pairs satisfying following criteria : 1 ) pairs within top ten in each dataset , 2 ) pairs with over score ‘1 . 0’ , and 3 ) unlabeled pairs . First , hyperglycemia has five hormone - drug pairs satisfying above criteria , and we analyze underlying mech - anisms of the three pairs with high scores through HIDEEP to support the evidence . Dehydroepiandrosterone ( DHEA ) has DEPs from 14 drug targets ( i . e . BABRA1 , BABRA2 , BABRA3 , BABR4 , BABR5 , BABR6 , BABRB1 , BABR2 , BABRD , BABRG1 , BABRG2 , BABRG3 , BABRP , and BABRQ ) to eleven disease genes ( i . e . SP1 , PRKCB , NF32L2 , INS , INSR , IRS2 , NOS3 , PTGS2 , HMGA1 , GCK , and SIM1 ) via intermediate molecules . Whereas , gamma - aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) physically binds to the 14 targets as well , which means that DHEA and GABA share the same targets and receptors . Figure 5a shows some crosstalk mechanisms whose DEPs are the shortest . Ellagic acid has DEPs from 15 drug targets ( i . e . CA1 , CA12 , CA14 , CA2 , CA3 , CA4 , CA5A , CA5 , CA9 , CSNK2A1 , PRKACA , PRKCA , SQLE , and SYK ) to 13 disease genes ( i . e . GCK , HMGA1 , HSD11B1 , INS , INSR , IRS2 , LEPR , NFE2L2 , NOS3 , PRKCB , PTGS2 , SIM1 , and SP1 ) via intermediate molecules . Whereas , melatonin has HEPs with length one from six receptors ( i . e . CALM3 , CALR , ESR1 , MTNR1A , MTNR1B , and NQO2 ) to 27 molecules of DEPs . Figure 5b shows some crosstalk mechanisms whose DEPs are the shortest . Tolbutamide has DEPs from two drug targets ( i . e . ABCC8 , KCNJ1 ) to eleven disease genes ( i . e . HMGA1 , HSD11B1 , INS , INSR , IRS2 . NF32L2 , NOS3 , PRKCB , PTGS2 , and SP1 ) via intermediate molecules . Whereas , melatonin has HEPs with length one from four receptors ( i . e . CALMC , CALR , ESR1 , and NQO2 ) to 14 molecules of DEPs . Figure 5c shows some crosstalk mechanisms whose DEPs are the shortest . Melatonin has been reported to suppress hyperglyce - mia , which implies that it can help therapeutic influence of ellagic acid and tolbutamide 25 . Second , ovarian neoplasm has two hormone - drug pairs satisfying above criteria . Quercetin has DEPs from three drug targets ( i . e . ATP5B , HIBCH , and STK17B ) to 24 disease genes ( i . e . AKT1 , BIRC5 , BRCA2 , CCNE1 , CDH1 , CDKN1B , CTNNB1 , EDNRA , EGFR , ERBB2 , FASN , HDAC6 , IL6ST , MAPK1 , MAPK3 , MET , MLH1 , NR5A1 , SKP2 , SOD1 , STAT3 , TERT , XIAP , and YAP1 ) via intermediate molecules . Whereas , transforming growth factor beta 1 ( TGF - beta1 ) has HEPs with length one from two receptors ( i . e . VASN and TGFBR2 ) to three molecules of DEPs . Figure 5d shows some particular crosstalk mechanisms whose DEPs are the shortest or cross - talk mechanisms that TGF - beta 1 affects greater than two molecules of each DEP . TGF - beta1 has been reported to modulate ovarian cancer invasion through upregulation of CAF - derived versican , which implies that it may have interference on the therapeutic efficacy of quercetin 26 . Disulfiram has DEPs from two drug targets ( i . e . ALDH2 and DBH ) to three disease genes ( i . e . EGFR , MAPK1 , and MAPK3 ) via intermediate molecules . Whereas , calcit - riol has HEPs with length one from one receptor ( VDR ) to three molecules of DEPs . Figure 5e shows all possible crosstalk mechanisms inferred by HIDEEP . Calcitriol has been observed to inhibit the proliferation of ovarian cancer cells , which implies that it can help therapeutic influence of disulfiram 27 . Third , acute kidney injury has five hormone - drug pairs satisfying above criteria , and we select three pairs with high scores for mechanism analysis . Dinoprostone has DEPs from three drug targets ( i . e . PTGER1 , PTGER2 , and PTGER4 ) to 18 disease genes ( i . e . ALB , BAX , CCR5 , CD44 , GSK3B , HBEGF , HSPA1A , NFE2L2 , NOS2 , NOS3 , OCLN , PPARG , RAPGER3 , SIRT1 , SPP1 , TNF , TP53 , and VEGFA ) via intermediate molecules . Whereas , serotonin has HEPs with length one from 14 receptors ( i . e . ADRA2A , ADRA2B , HTR1A , HTR1B , HTR1D , HTR1E , HTR1F , HTR2A , HTR2B , HTR2C , HTR4 , HTR5A , HT6 , and HTR7 ) to nine molecules of DEPs . Figure 5f shows the par - ticular crosstalk mechanisms that serotonin’s HEPs affect more than two molecules of each DEP . It was observed that serotonin reuptake inhibition causes kidney vasoconstriction with resultant hypoperfusion . In other words , sero - tonin may have assistant influence for therapeutic efficacy of dinoprostone by preventing or treating acute kidney injury 28 . Fenoldopam has DEPs from seven drug targets ( i . e . ADRA1A , ADRA1D , ADRA2A , ADRA2B , ADRA2C , DRD1 , and DRD5 ) to 18 disease genes ( i . e . ALB , BAX , CCR5 , CD44 , GSK3B , HB3GF , HSPA1A , NFE2L2 , NOS2 , NOS3 , OCLN , PPARG , RAPGEF3 , SIRT1 , SPP1 , TNF , TP53 , and VEGFA ) via intermediate molecules . Whereas , acetylcholine has HEPs with length one from five receptors ( i . e . CHRM2 , CHRM3 , CHRM4 , CHRM5 , and CHRNB1 ) to eleven molecules of DEPs . Figure 5g shows some particular crosstalk mechanisms whose DEPs include ELAVL1 , one of the intermediate molecules . It was observed that acetylcholine receptor agonist attenuates septic acute kidney injury , which implies that acetylcholine can help therapeutic influence of fenoldopam by suppressing inflammation 29 . Alprostadil has DEPs from two drug targets ( i . e . PTGER1 and PTGER2 ) to 15 disease genes ( i . e . BAX , CD44 , GSK3B , HBEGF , NFE2L2 , NOS2 , NOS3 , OCLN , PPARG , RAPGEF3 , SIRT1 , SPP1 , TNF , TP53 , and VEGFA ) via intermediate molecules . Whereas , progesterone has HEPs with length one from four receptors ( i . e . ESR1 , NR3C2 , OPRK1 , and PGR ) to eleven molecules of DEPs . Figure 5h shows some particular crosstalk mecha - nisms involving ESR1 which has the most number of HEPs among all receptors . It was observed that progesterone participates in kidney electrolyte balance whose abnormality can cause acute kidney injury , and this observation implies that progesterone can change the therapeutic efficacy of alprostadil 30 . www . nature . com / scientificreports / 9 Scientific REPORts | 7 : 16600 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41598 - 017 - 16855 - 8 Discussion We developed an in silico model called as HIDEEP that predicts hormone - drug pairs whose hormones have potential impacts on drug actions and eventually can change drug efficacy . To this end , we took advantage of com - prehensive and large - scale molecular networks in consideration of that a hormone can cause signaling crosstalk to MOA of a drug in direct or indirect ( distant ) way . HIDEEP has following four characteristics . First , it is not confined to specific disease types but can be applied to any disease which has one or more disease genes . Second , it can be applied to any hormone - drug pair whose hormone receptors and drug targets are known . Third , it gives Figure 5 . Underlying mechanisms of hormone - drug pairs with high scores for top 3 diseases , hyperglycemia , ovarian neoplasms and acute kidney injury . Each node type means drug ( black ) , hormone ( purple ) , drug target ( green ) , disease gene ( red ) , hormone target ( yellow ) , intermediate molecule ( gray ) . Each figure shows how a hormone causes crosstalk to drug MOA using drug effect paths and hormone effect paths analyzed by HIDEEP . ( a – c ) Three figures are for hyperglycemia . ( d , e ) Two figures are for ovarian neoplasms . ( f – h ) Three figures are for acute kidney injury . www . nature . com / scientificreports / 10 Scientific REPORts | 7 : 16600 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41598 - 017 - 16855 - 8 not simple interactions ( e . g . hormone A and drug B interact each other ) but intimately directional relations of hormone - drug pairs ( e . g . hormone A has an impact on drug B efficacy ) . Last , it shows underlying mechanisms of candidate hormone - drug pairs and helps to understand how a hormone induces signaling crosstalk to drug MOA and results in changes in drug efficacy . The average HEP lengths of known hormone - drug pairs exceed those of unlabeled pairs in all twenty diseases , supporting the assumption that hormones have the higher potential to affect the efficacy of drugs if their recep - tors are closer to DEPs of the drugs . In addition , HIDEEP performs AUROC 0 . 89 on average for diverse twenty diseases and this result implies that HIDEEP can be widely applied to various kinds of other diseases . The perfor - mance comparison with a state - of - the - art method ( i . e . RWDDI ) and a closely related method ( i . e . NBDTI ) shows that HIDEEP averagely better performs for overall diseases with high AUROC value and small variance than RWDDI and NBDTI . It implies that the HIDEEP is more robust for disease types compared to the two methods . In addition , HIDEEP uses paths to predict hormone impacts on drug efficacy , thus it can elucidate hormones’ signaling crosstalk mechanism . Hormones are affected by numerous factors ( e . g . a disease , drug treatment , growth , weight change , aging , dietary , or psychological stress ) , which results in different hormone levels in individuals . As sertraline was deter - mined as a more appropriate antidepressant rather than imipramine for a depressed woman by taking account into the sex hormones 2 , individual hormone difference should be considered for effective drug treatment . Thus , precision medicine can be accelerated by considering hormone impacts on drug efficacy . HIDEEP can serve as a first - step computational approach for high - throughput identification of signaling crosstalks between hormones and drugs and also can give new insights into better precision medicine . Due to limited known hormone - drug pairs whose hormones impact on the efficacy of the drugs , the sizes of gold standard sets used in this study are not sufficiently large . More studies about hormone - drug association are required and hormone - drug pairs with high scores graded by HIDEEP can be suggested as candidates for future in vitro or in vivo experiments . Additionally , in the future , we plan to challenge weighted networks that can make it feasible for a model to come closer to the real biological system and improve the predictive power . Methods Integration of massive molecular interactions . We collect molecular interactions from three public databases : BioGRID 7 ( protein - protein interactions ) , KEGG pathways 8 ( signaling interactions , gene regulatory interactions , and protein - protein interactions ) , and TRANSFAC 9 ( gene regulatory interactions ) . In order to inte - grate heterogeneous data from the three different databases , we use reference identifiers as follows : Entrez iden - tifiers for genes 31 and KEGG compound identifiers 8 for chemical compounds . Proteins are represented by their encoding genes , thus each entity of the molecular interactions is either a gene ( protein ) or a compound . Interactions from KEGG pathways are collected from KEGG Markup Language ( KGML ) files using KEGGgraph R package 32 . Interactions from KEGG pathways have sixteen relation types whose entities are genes ( proteins ) or compounds . We filter out particular relation types if they are metabolic reactions , if the number of relations is too small , or if the meaning or direction of relations is not clear . Interactions for eight relations types , therefore , are extracted ( i . e . activation , inhibition , expression , repression , phosphorylation , dephosphorylation , binding / associ - ation , and dissociation ) . Gene regulatory interactions are collected from TRANSFAC as well as KEGG pathways . Protein - protein interactions facilitate rich network analysis with massive molecular interaction data . Physical interactions are extracted from BioGRID . In order to construct a reliable network , we extract only physical protein interactions which have interactions types such as direct interaction , physical association , and co - localization . For network analysis , protein - protein interactions are considered as bidirectional while the other signaling interac - tions and gene regulatory interactions are considered as unidirectional . Arrangement of hormones , drugs , and disease genes . EndoNet provides physical interactions between human hormones and their receptor proteins . DrugBank provides physical interactions between drugs and their target proteins . We extract hormones that have one or more receptors and drugs which have one or more targets . CTD provides two relation types ( ‘marker / mechanism’ and ‘therapeutic’ ) for disease - gene associa - tions . ‘Marker / mechanism’ means that a gene is a biomarker of a disease or play a role in the etiology of disease on the other hand ‘therapeutic’ means that a gene is a therapeutic target for disease treatment 11 . In order to consider etiology associations , only disease - gene associations with ‘marker / mechanism’ are extracted . Arrangement of gold standard sets . There has been no database or article yet which provides lists of hormone - drug pairs whose hormones affect drug efficacy . In order to define gold standard sets for each dis - ease , we determine to extract hormone - drug interactions from drug - drug interactions . DrugBank provides drug - drug interactions and their detailed descriptions which include directional relations between drugs ( e . g . trastuzumab - doxorubicin : trastuzumab may increase the cardiotoxic activities of doxorubicin ) . Therefore , we firstly clarify a directional relation for every drug - drug interaction . The relations can be classified into four cat - egories such as ‘drug A enhances the action of drug B’ , ‘drug A disturbs the action of drug B’ , ‘drug A induces adverse effects from drug B’ , or ‘unknown’ . We filter out hormone - drug pairs with ‘unknown’ relation so that extracted ‘drug A - drug B interactions’ are converted to ‘influence from drug A to drug B’ . Secondly , the ‘influ - ence from drug A to drug B’ is extracted if drug A is one of the human hormones we collect from EndoNet ( i . e . from ‘influence from drug A to drug B’ to ‘influence from hormone A to drug B’ ) . We finally choose it as a gold standard sample if its drug is included in target disease - treating drugs . Selection of diseases . We aim to apply HIDEEP to twenty as various diseases as possible . To this end , we extract 139 diseases which have at least three gold standard samples as well as at least one disease gene . It is firstly required to filter out similar or superior diseases of other diseases to avoid overlaps . Thus , we eliminate superior www . nature . com / scientificreports / 11 Scientific REPORts | 7 : 16600 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41598 - 017 - 16855 - 8 diseases which have over two subordinate ( child ) diseases based on MeSH hierarchical trees 33 . Second , diseases are tested whether they have similar MESH descriptions or neighbor MESH tree numbers to other diseases , and then similar diseases except for one representative disease are eliminated . When extracted diseases are sorted by the sizes of gold standard samples , diseases on high ranks are mostly non - cancer diseases . In order to avoid any bias coming from particular disease types , we determine to cover cancer diseases as well as non - cancer diseases even though the cancer types are not on high ranks in sorted disease list . Consequentially fifteen non - cancer diseases and five cancer diseases are selected for case studies . Inference of drug effect paths . In order to show therapeutic efficacy for disease treatment , drugs ulti - mately target disease genes either by indirectly affecting them via intermediate molecules or by directly binding to them ( Fig . 6a ) . Disease genes tend to cluster each other by being in the neighborhood , and diseases are caused by a breakdown of a disease gene set rather than a single disease gene 34 , 35 . A research group figured out that it is not necessary for a drug to target all disease genes , and they defined a new method called ‘closest paths’ which implies drug MOA 36 ( Fig . 6b ) . We , therefore , refer to the ‘closest paths’ and newly define drug effect paths ( DEPs ) as a set of all possible shortest paths from each drug target to the nearest disease gene , which implies MOA of a drug . The shortest paths between two molecules are searched based on the breadth - first search algorithm . As Fig . 6c shows , for example , a drug has two drug targets , T1 and T2 , and their nearest disease genes , S1 and S2 respectively . The shortest path from T1 to S1 has four molecules and path length three , and each of the shortest paths from T2 to S2 has three molecules and path length two ( Fig . 6c ) . Thus , here the drug has totally three DEPs . Inference of hormone effect paths . We assume that hormones whose receptors are closer to DEPs have the higher potential to affect drug efficacy . Thus , hormone effect paths ( HEPs ) are newly defined as the shortest paths from hormone receptors to molecules of DEPs and HEPs possibly cause signaling crosstalk to DEPs . As Fig . 6d shows , for example , a hormone has two receptors , R1 and R2 , and their nearest molecules of DEPs , T2 and S1 . The length of the shortest paths from R1 to T2 is shorter ( i . e . two ) than that of the shortest path from R2 to S1 ( i . e . three ) . We only consider the very shortest paths among all shortest paths from each receptor to molecules of DEPs , thus HEPs become the shortest paths from R1 to T1 ( i . e . R1 → M1 → T2 and R1 → M2 → T2 ) . DEPs consist of the shortest paths from each drug target to the nearest disease gene , which results that the DEPs have one or more different lengths ( e . g . two and three ) in Fig . 6c . Whereas , HEPs consist of shortest paths from overall receptors to the nearest molecules of DEPs , which results that HEPs have the only one length ( e . g . two ) in Fig . 6d . Code availability .
