Here we show that blocking vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) signaling by DC101 ( a VEGF - receptor - 2 antibody ) decreases interstitial fluid pressure , not by restoring lymphatic function , but by producing a morphologically and functionally “normalized” vascular network . We demonstrate that the normalization process prunes immature vessels and improves the integrity and function of the remaining vasculature by enhancing the perivascular cell and basement membrane coverage . We also show that DC101 induces a hydrostatic pressure gradient across the vascular wall , which leads to a deeper penetration of molecules into tumors . Thus , vascular normaliza - tion may contribute to the improved survival rates in tumor - bearing animals and in colorectal carcinoma patients treated with an anti - VEGF antibody in combination with cytotoxic therapies . Introduction The present treatment of solid tumors is plagued by two problems : physiological barriers impair the delivery of therapeutic agents in optimal quantities , and genetic and epigenetic mechanisms contribute to drug resistance . Antiangiogenic therapy has the potential to over - come or circumvent these problems . A recent Phase III clinical trial ( 1 ) has provided the first clinical proof of this hypothesis , the com - bination of Avastin , a monoclonal antibody against vascular endothe - lial growth factor ( VEGF ) , with conventional chemotherapy increased disease - free survival by 5 months in colorectal cancer patients . In addition to the direct antivascular effects that lead to the death of cancer cells , we proposed that anti - VEGF antibody improves the delivery of cytotoxic agents to tumors and , thus , increases the effec - tiveness of combination therapy ( 2 ) . We have recently shown that an anti - VEGF antibody can lower interstitial fluid pressure ( IFP ) in transplanted tumors in mice ( 3 ) and in rectal carcinomas in patients ( 4 ) . However , the mechanisms of IFP reduction and how this reduc - tion affects drug delivery are not known . In normal tissues , the excess fluid filtered from blood vessels is drained by lymphatic vessels to maintain the IFP close to zero ( mm Hg ) . In tumors , IFP homeostasis is perturbed because of impaired lymphatic function ( 5 , 6 ) and ab - normalities in vascular structure and function ( 7 ) . Because of the high vascular permeability and the impaired lymphatic drainage , the on - cotic and hydrostatic pressures in the microvascular and interstitial spaces are at equilibrium in tumors ( 8 , 9 ) . To unravel the mechanism of IFP reduction induced by blocking VEGF signaling , we examined the effect of DC101 on the determinants of interstitial hypertension , including changes in the morphology , wall structure , and function of tumor vasculature during the course of treatment . Materials and Methods Animals and Tumors . The murine mammary carcinoma MCaIV , human small cell lung carcinoma 54A , human glioblastoma multiforme U87 , and human colon adenocarcinoma LS174T were grown in nude or severe com - bined immunodeficient ( SCID ) mice . MCaIV , 54A , and U87 were transplanted s . c . MCaIV and LS174T tumors were also transplanted in dorsal skinfold chambers in SCID mice for intravital microscopy and for microvascular pressure ( MVP ) and IFP measurements . Animals were anesthetized with ketamine / xylazine ( 100 / 10 mg / kg , i . m . ) unless otherwise noted . DC101 Treatment . DC101 ( ImClone Systems Inc . , New York , NY ) was administered i . p . at a dose of 40 mg / kg , previously determined to have antitumor effects in vivo ( 10 ) . The control group received 40 mg / kg , i . p of nonspecific rat IgG1 antibody ( ImClone ) . All of the experiments were done 3 days after the injection of DC101 ( IgG for the control ) , unless otherwise noted . Functional Lymphatic Assay . To identify the functional lymphatic ves - sels in tumors , ferritin microlymphangiography and lymphatic vessel endothe - lial hyaluronan receptor - 1 ( LYVE - 1 ) immunostaining were performed accord - ing to published methods ( 6 ) . Intravital Microscopy . To visualize functional blood vessels in MCaIV or LS174T in the dorsal chamber of SCID mice in vivo , fluorescein - labeled dextran ( M r 2 , 000 , 000 ; Sigma ) was injected i . v . ( 11 ) . Vascular length per unit area and vessel mean diameter were obtained by averaging measurements over six random regions per mouse . The effective vascular permeability was meas - ured using cyanine - 5 - labeled BSA as described previously ( 12 ) . For multipho - ton microscopy images , maximum intensity projections of stacked images were done offline using Confocal Assistant . Immunostaining of Collagen IV . MCaIV - tumor - bearing mice ( n (cid:1) 6 in control group ; n (cid:1) 5 in DC101 - treated group ) were injected with FITC - CD31 1 h before perfusing fixative . The mice were perfused and fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde , and 100 - (cid:1) m - thick sections were prepared ( 13 ) . Collagen IV ( Chemicon ) was stained overnight ; and tetramethyl rhodamine isothiocya - nate ( TRITC ) goat antirabbit antibody was used as a secondary antibody . Three images per section were taken by confocal microscopy . Total vessel length and the length of segments covered by collagen IV were traced in three random regions ( each region was 700 (cid:1) m by 700 (cid:1) m ) for each 100 - (cid:1) m - thick section . On average , (cid:2) 50 vessel segments were measured per mouse . Immunostaining of (cid:1) SMA . Similarly , MCaIV - tumor - bearing mice ( n (cid:1) 4 ) were given injections of FITC - CD31 and were perfused and fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde , and 100 - (cid:1) m - thick sections were prepared . Anti - (cid:2) - smooth muscle actin ( (cid:2) SMA ; Cy - 3 - conjugated mouse monoclonal , clone 1A4 ; Sigma ) antibody was used to identify (cid:2) SMA - positive perivascular cells . The tissue sections were examined using a confocal microscope . Quantification was performed in a manner similar to collagen IV staining . IFP Measurements with the Wick - in - Needle Technique . IFP was meas - ured with the wick - in - needle technique ( 14 ) prior to and during DC101 / control Received 1 / 9 / 04 ; revised 3 / 18 / 04 ; accepted 4 / 9 / 04 .

DC101 / control antibodies were injected once every 3 days . For each time point , IFP was measured in at least two different tumor regions . MVP and IFP Measurements with the Micropipette Technique . MCaIV tumors were implanted in the dorsal skinfold chamber of SCID mice as described previously ( 15 ) . The dorsal skinfold chamber preparation provides a stable and easy access for IFP and MVP measurements with the micropipette technique ( 8 , 16 ) . For each mouse , two to seven IFP and MVP measurements were obtained . Under stereomicroscopic guidance , micropipettes with an open - ing of (cid:2) 2 . 5 (cid:1) m were inserted inside blood vessels to measure the MVP ( confirmed by Lissamine Green B injection ) . The IFPs were generally meas - ured at 0 . 5 – 1 mm from the tumor surface . Oncotic Pressure Measurements . The chronic wick technique was used to collect tumor interstitial fluid ( 9 ) . A long wick ( (cid:2) 5 cm ) was transplanted together with the MCaIV tumors and was collected postmortem 2 weeks later ; interstitial fluid was obtained by centrifugation . A membrane colloid osmom - eter with ultrafiltration membranes ( Amicon PM10 ; Millipore Corp . , Bedford , MA ) was used to measure oncotic pressure . Extravasation of TRITC - BSA . TRITC - BSA ( 0 . 1 ml ; Molecular Probes ) was injected i . v . 1 h before perfusion fixation in tumor - bearing mice . Bioti - nylated lectin was also injected 5 min before fixation . Three 10 - (cid:1) m - thick frozen sections , 50 (cid:1) m apart , were prepared from each tumor block . Images were taken using two - photon microscopy . Perfused biotinylated lectin was used to identify functional vessels , and extravasation pattern of TRITC - BSA was analyzed using a program written in ImageJ . Ten concentric rings of 3 . 25 - (cid:1) m thickness were drawn starting at the vessel wall . Average intensity was calculated within each ring , and the intensity profile was fitted to an exponential function ( I (cid:1) Ae (cid:3) x / L (cid:4) C , where I (cid:1) pixel intensity , x (cid:1) distance from vessels , and L (cid:1) characteristic penetration length ) . The characteristic penetration length was compared between the two treatment groups . Statistical Analysis . Data are presented as mean (cid:5) SE . Significant differ - ences between groups were determined with a Student’s t test ( JMP Program ) . P (cid:6) 0 . 05 was considered statistically significant . Results DC101 Decreases IFP without Affecting Lymphatic Function . We first confirmed that similar to a VEGF blocking antibody ( 3 ) , DC101 decreased IFP in both human small cell lung carcinoma 54A ( Fig . 1 A ) , and human glioblastoma multiforme U87 xenografts ( Fig . 1 B ) . At the same time , we did not find any evidence of functional lymphatic vessels in the tumors of either treated or control animals ( Fig . 1 C ) . Thus , the drop in IFP could not be attributed to modifica - tions in lymphatic function . DC101 Normalizes the Architecture of the Tumor Vasculature . We then examined the effect of DC101 on the morphology of blood vessels in the murine mammary carcinoma MCaIV growing in dorsal skinfold chambers . Three days after a single injection of DC101 , the vascular density and vessel diameter decreased significantly ( Table 1 ; Fig . 2 , A and B ) . To obtain further insight into the dynamic changes occurring in the tumor vasculature , we continuously monitored the same region of the tumor over 6 consecutive days using two - photon microscopy . This technique allowed us to image up to 200 (cid:1) m deep with 1 - (cid:1) m resolution ( 11 ) . In contrast to skeletal muscle , which has an organized vasculature with a relatively smooth vascular wall and uniform diameter ( Fig . 2 C ) , untreated MCaIV tumors had tortuous vessels with abrupt changes in vessel diameter ( arrowheads in Fig . 2 D ) . On the basis of the dynamic high resolution images , the surpris - ing finding was that , 2 – 3 days after DC101 treatment , many of these vessels also became less tortuous besides getting smaller in diameter ( arrow in Fig . 2 E ) . By day 5 , in some regions , some of these vessels regressed completely . Furthermore , the vessels at the tumor – host interface also became less tortuous and assumed a relatively normal morphology ( Fig . 2 F ) . Similar striking vascular changes were also observed in the human colon adenocarcinoma LS174T ( Fig . 2 , G and H ) . Thus , DC101 “normalizes” the architecture of the vascular net - work before complete regression . DC101 Normalizes the Wall Structure of the Tumor Vascula - ture . In addition to architectural abnormalities , the tumor vasculature is characterized by a paucity of , or abnormalities in , mural cells and basement membrane ( 7 , 13 , 17 ) . To test whether DC101 also normal - ized the wall structure , we perfused the tumors with FITC - CD31 and stained frozen sections for collagen IV and (cid:2) SMA ( which label basement membrane and mural cells , respectively ) . Unlike the vessels in normal muscle , the collagen IV staining around some vessels was below the detection limit in MCaIV tumors ( Fig . 3 A ) . Consistent with normalization , more vessels exhibited collagen IV staining after DC101 treatment ( Fig . 3 , B and C ) . DC101 also significantly in - creased the fractional coverage of tumor blood vessels by (cid:2) SMA - positive cells ( Fig . 3 D ) . Approximately 25 % of the vessels in un - treated tumors had little or no perivascular cell coverage , but this fraction dropped to (cid:2) 8 % after DC101 treatment ( P (cid:6) 0 . 005 ) . Thus , DC101 induces structural normalization of the tumor vasculature by homogenizing the vessel size , reducing vessel tortuosity , and increas - ing the fractional coverage of the vascular endothelium by perivas - cular cells and basement membrane . DC101 Enhances Oncotic Pressure Gradient Across the Tumor Vasculature . To determine whether structural normalization of tu - mor vessels translates into functional normalization , we measured the Fig . 1 . DC101 decreased the interstitial fluid pressure ( IFP ) in multiple tumor models without affecting lymphatic function . A and B , f , the control group ; F , the DC101 group .

No LYVE - 1 - positive vessels were found inside the tumor in either the DC101 or the control group . 3732 VASCULAR NORMALIZATION BY VEGF RECEPTOR 2 BLOCKADE Research . on July 20 , 2017 . © 2004 American Association for Cancer cancerres . aacrjournals . org Downloaded from functional parameters that govern the transport of molecules across the vessel wall . These include vascular permeability , plasma and interstitial oncotic pressures , MVP , and IFP ( 18 , 19 ) . Three days after the injection of DC101 the vascular permeability of albumin in MCaIV , a profoundly leaky tumor , was decreased by 51 % ( Table 1 ) . In general , leaky vessels in tumors lead to an increase in the interstitial oncotic pressure ( 9 ) , which becomes approximately equal to the plasma oncotic pressure . We found that in DC101 - treated tumors the interstitial oncotic pressure was significantly lower than in the control group ( Fig . 3 E ) , whereas the plasma oncotic pressure did not change . This decrease in interstitial oncotic pressure is consistent with the decrease in vascular permeability to macromolecules induced by DC101 . The enhanced oncotic pressure gradient across the vascula - ture is another hallmark of tumor vasculature normalization . DC101 Induces a Hydrostatic Pressure Gradient Across the Tumor Vasculature . In solid tumors , MVP is approximately equal to IFP , leading to nearly zero pressure difference across the vessel wall ( 8 ) . As a matter of fact , these two pressures are so closely coupled that changing the vascular pressure leads to similar changes in the IFP within seconds , until they both become equal again ( 20 ) . Thus the Table 1 Physiological changes in tumor vasculature after DC101 treatment Vascular morphology and permeability were measured before and 3 days after a single injection of DC101 / control antibodies . No changes were observed for the control group . DC101 significantly reduced the vascular density , diameter , and vascular permeability in MCaIV tumors implanted in dorsal skinfold chambers of severe combined immunodeficient ( SCID ) mice versus control .

For each control group , some vessels disappeared , but the caliber of most vessels did not change or decrease in size ( arrowheads in D and G ) . In contrast , in DC101 - treated mice , many tumor vessels were either pruned or reduced in size ( arrows in E , F , and H ) . Some vessels appeared less tortuous after DC101 treatment .

To test this , we measured MVP in control and DC101 - treated tumors by directly inserting micropipettes in MCaIV tumor vessels ( 16 ) . We found that MVP was unaffected by DC101 treatment ( Fig . 3 F ) . Thus , DC101 creates a sustained hydrostatic pressure gradient across the vasculature . DC101 Increases BSA Penetration in Tumors . Movement of molecules across vessel walls occurs by diffusion and convection . Diffusion is governed by concentration gradients across the vessel wall , whereas convection is governed by pressure gradients . To test whether the pressure gradient across the vascular wall improves the penetration of large molecules , we injected fluorescently - labeled BSA i . v . into MCaIV - tumor - bearing mice and observed the pattern of BSA extravasation . We also identified functional blood vessels using bi - otinylated lectin . Quantitative analysis confirmed that DC101 pro - duced a significantly deeper penetration of BSA molecules into the tumor ( Fig . 4 , A – E ) . Discussion The data presented here provide compelling evidence in support of the normalization hypothesis : that judicious application of antiangio - genic treatment can normalize the tumor vasculature by pruning the immature vessels and fortifying the remaining ones ( 2 ) . We show that the normalized tumor vasculature is less tortuous and the vessels are more uniformly covered by pericytes and basement membrane ( Fig . 4 F ) . This result implies that vessels with less mural cell coverage are more vulnerable to DC101 - induced regression , which is consistent with previous findings that tumor vessels without mural cells tend to regress after VEGF withdrawal ( 21 ) . Our functional data demonstrate for the first time that a drop in vascular permeability induces trans - vascular gradients in oncotic and hydrostatic pressure in tumors . The induced hydrostatic pressure gradient improves the penetration of large molecules into tumors . In tumors , the abnormally high leakiness of the vasculature hinders drug delivery by inducing blood flow stasis ( 22 , 23 ) , whereas normalized vessels are less leaky to macromolecules . However , the permeability of the normalized vasculature is still significantly higher than that of normal tissues ( 12 , 18 ) . The small drop in oncotic pressure from 19 to 17 mm Hg induced by DC101 is also indirect evidence that the vascular permeability of DC101 - treated MCaIV tumors is still elevated . For example , in s . c . tissue , the oncotic pressure is (cid:2) 8 mm Hg ( 9 ) . The change in oncotic pressure associated with DC101 leads to a minor increase in the hydrostatic pressure gradient , which is sufficient to increase the transvascular convection of a macromolecule and is most likely responsible for the deeper penetration of albumin . Fluid movement across the vascular wall can be described by Starling’s equation ( 18 ) . Starling’s equation states that the rate of fluid movement across a unit area of vascular wall ( J v / A ) is proportional to the net pressure difference across the vessel wall : J v / A (cid:1) L p { ( MVP (cid:3) IFP ) (cid:3) (cid:3) ( (cid:4) p (cid:3) (cid:4) i ) } where L p ( the hydraulic conductivity of the vessel wall ) is the pro - portionality coefficient and A is the vascular wall area . As shown in the equation , the hydrostatic pressure gradient ( MVP (cid:3) IFP ) is balanced by the oncotic pressure gradient [ the difference between (cid:4) p ( plasma oncotic pressure ) and (cid:4) i ( interstitial oncotic pressure ) ] . The reflection coefficient , (cid:3) , determines the effectiveness of the oncotic pressure gradient across the vascular wall . The value of (cid:3) for albumin varies between 0 for the liver ( with a high vascular permeability ) and 1 for the impermeable brain vessels ; lung has a (cid:3) of 0 . 5 ( 24 , 25 ) . To our knowledge , the reflection coefficient of the tumor vasculature has Fig . 3 . Normalization of vessel wall by DC101 . Vessels were perfused with FITC - CD31 ( green ) and basement membrane was stained with collagen IV - specific antibody ( red ) . A , in the control MCaIV tumors , some vessels lacked collagen IV staining ( Col IV ) . B , after DC101 treatment , more vessels in MCaIV stained for collagen IV . C , quantifi - cation of collagen IV coverage . Fractional coverage of collagen IV vessels was signifi - cantly higher in the DC101 group ( n (cid:1) 6 in control group , n (cid:1) 5 in DC101 - treated group ; P (cid:6) 0 . 05 ) . D , quantification of (cid:2) - smooth muscle actin ( (cid:2) SMA ) - positive cells in the tumor vasculature . Fractional coverage of (cid:2) SMA - positive cells was significantly higher in the DC101 group ( n (cid:1) 4 ; P (cid:6) 0 . 005 ) . E , there was no change in plasma oncotic pressure in MCaIV tumors in the DC101 group when compared with the control group . However , the interstitial oncotic pressure dropped significantly in the DC101 group ( n (cid:1) 5 ; P (cid:6) 0 . 05 ) . F , DC101 did not affect the microvascular pressure ( MVP ) , whereas the interstitial fluid pressure ( IFP ) was significantly reduced in MCaIV tumors ( n (cid:1) 5 ; P (cid:6) 0 . 05 ) . Thus , DC101 induced a hydrostatic pressure gradient across the vascular wall . Image width : A and B , 700 (cid:1) m .

Because the tumor vasculature has relatively large pores ( 26 ) and the oncotic pressure in the interstitium is similar to the oncotic pressure of plasma , the reflection coefficient is most likely close to 0 . Based on the theory for hindered transport of rigid solutes , the calculated reflection coefficient for BSA is 0 . 0002 ( (cid:3) (cid:1) [ 1 (cid:3) [ 1 (cid:3) radius of BSA ( 3 . 5 nm ) / vessel pore size ( 500 nm ) ] 2 ] 2 ) ( 26 ) . Thus , the increase in oncotic pressure gradient induced by DC101 has minimal effects on the transvascular flow . We have previously shown that angiotensin II can increase the systemic blood pressure in mice and can create a pressure gradient across the vessel wall in tumors ( 20 ) . Unfortunately , interstitial pres - sure catches up with vascular pressure , and the pressure gradient across the vessel wall dissipates in less than 1 min . Nevertheless , even these short - lived gradients can increase the delivery of specific anti - bodies in tumors ( 20 ) . Thus , the sustained hydrostatic pressure gra - dient across the tumor vasculature , induced by DC101 , can increase the transvascular convection of large molecules , despite a drop in vascular permeability to macromolecules . The original rationale for combining antiangiogenic and cytotoxic therapies was to target two distinct cell populations within solid tumors : cancer cells and endothelial cells . When endothelial cells are targeted , blood vessels should be destroyed , and , thus , the delivery of therapeutics is compromised . However , several preclinical studies clearly demonstrate that the delivery of therapeutics is not compro - mised by antiangiogenic agents ( 27 ) , and it even increases in some cases ( 28 ) . The vessel normalization and the restoration of pressure gradients induced by VEGF blockade may explain the increased uptake of cytotoxic agents in tumors . For a cytotoxic agent to be effective , it must reach all cancer cells and in effective quantities . Antiangiogenic therapy , as shown by this study , might facilitate a more uniform delivery of therapeutic agents to cancer cells , including those that are farther from the vessels . This mechanism might con - tribute to the potentiation of conventional therapies by antiangiogenic agents ( 1 , 10 , 28 – 31 ) . Addendum To dissect molecular mechanisms involved in the normalization process , we collected total RNA and protein from MCaIV tumors 3 days after the com - pletion of treatment with DC101 or control IgG . cDNA gene chips were used for screening ( Angiogenic Gene Array , SuperArray , Bethesda , Maryland ) . Based on the gene array data , multiple genes were found to be differentially expressed after DC101 treatment ( e . g . 2 . 2 fold downregulation of Ang2 ) . Real time PCR data ( LUX system , InVitrogen , Carlsbad , California ) only confirmed the significant difference ( P (cid:6) 0 . 005 ) in Ang2 expression between control ( n (cid:1) 8 , 1 . 29 (cid:5) 0 . 22 ) and DC101 - treated group ( n (cid:1) 8 , 0 . 29 (cid:5) 0 . 06 ) . Furthermore , by Western analysis there was a marked decrease in the level of Ang2 protein after DC101 treatment . Immunostaining revealed Ang2 expres - sion in both tumor and stromal cells . These data suggest that VEGFR2 blockade induces a decrease in Ang2 expression in tumors . Ang2 has been shown to destabilize blood vessel ( 7 ) , thus the reduction in Ang2 expression may contribute to a more stable vasculature as described above . Further studies Fig . 4 . Normalization of vessels improved the penetration of molecules in tumors . Mice bearing s . c . MCaIV tumors were injected with tetramethyl rhodamine isothiocyanate ( TRITC ) - BSA 1 h before perfusion fixation . Examples of frozen sections of MCaIV tumors with perfused biotinylated lectin ( A ) and extravasated TRITC - BSA ( B ) were pre - pared . Vessels were identified ( C ) ; and using an automated routine in ImageJ ( http : / / rsb . info . nih - . gov / ij / ) , we quantified the average intensity of extravasted TRITC - BSA as a function of distance from the blood vessel wall ( D and E ) . The extrav - asation of BSA was quantified by fitting the inten - sity profiles to an exponential function to yield a characteristic penetration length ( n (cid:1) 9 sections ; 3 sections per tumor ; P (cid:6) 0 . 05 ) . The characteristic penetration lengths are 7 . 26 (cid:5) 1 . 11 (cid:1) m ( mean (cid:5) SE ) and 11 . 23 (cid:5) 1 . 41 (cid:1) m for the control and DC101 groups , respectively , indicating that DC101 leads to a more uniform penetration of albumin from blood vessels into the tumor . F , model of tumor vasculature normalization . Blood vessels in control tumors ( treated with a non - specific IgG antibody ) are tortuous , hyperperme - able , and immature . Their high permeability and the lack of functional lymphatics lead to an ele - vated oncotic pressure and interstitial fluid pressure ( IFP ) . DC101 ( anti - VEGF receptor - 2 treatment ) prunes immature blood vessels and decreases the diameter of residual vessels ; the vasculature be - comes less tortuous and more organized , with more perivascular cells and basement membrane cover - age . Furthermore , DC101 decreases vascular per - meability , which induces a hydrostatic pressure gradient that improves drug delivery .
