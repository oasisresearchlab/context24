Stadnick 2 , 8 , 11 Abstract Background COVID - 19 inequities are abundant in low - income communities of color . Addressing COVID - 19 vac - cine hesitancy to promote equitable and sustained vaccination for underserved communities requires a multi - level , scalable , and sustainable approach . It is also essential that efforts acknowledge the broader healthcare needs of these communities including engagement in preventive services . Methods This is a hybrid type 3 effectiveness - implementation study that will include a multi - level , longitudinal , mixed - methods data collection approach designed to assess the sustained impact of a co - created multicomponent strategy relying on bidirectional learning , shared decision - making , and expertise by all team members . The study capitalizes on a combination of implementation strategies including mHealth outreach with culturally appropri - ate messaging , care coordination to increase engagement in high priority preventive services , and the co - design of these strategies using community advisory boards led by Community Weavers . Community Weavers are individuals with lived experience as members of an underserved community serving as cultural brokers between communities , public health systems , and researchers to co - create community - driven , culturally sensitive public health solutions . The study will use an adaptive implementation approach operationalized in a sequential multiple assignment randomized trial design of 300 participants from three sites in a Federally Qualified Health Center in Southern California . This design will allow examining the impact of various implementation strategy components and deliver more intensive support to those who benefit from it most . The primary effectiveness outcomes are COVID - 19 vaccine completion , engagement in preventive services , and vaccine confidence . The primary implementation outcomes are reach , adoption , implementation , and maintenance of the multicomponent strategy over a 12 - month follow - up period . * Correspondence : Borsika A .

Background COVID‑19 disparities experienced by underserved communities in California The COVID - 19 pandemic has punctuated perva - sive health disparities among immigrant , refugee , Latino , Asian , and Black , Indigenous , People of Color ( BIPOC ) communities [ 1 , 2 ] . These communities are significantly more likely to experience mortality and morbidity from COVID - 19 , along with lagging test - ing and vaccination rates compared to predominantly white communities [ 3 ] . Despite the availability of mul - tiple safe and effective vaccines that have been rec - ommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) , vaccination rates have been slower and variable in BIPOC communities [ 4 , 5 ] . Although current data on vaccination rates in the United States of America ( USA ) offer hope towards ending the COVID - 19 pandemic ( as of this writing ) , 85 % of adults completed the primary vaccine series ; 65 % of eligible adults have received a booster dose in addition to completing the primary series ; and vac - cine uptake has lagged across BIPOC communities in San Diego County with only 51 % of Black , 69 % of His - panic , and 71 % of Asian residents having completed the primary vaccines series [ 6 ] . To address persistent inequities , the CDC National Forum on COVID - 19 vaccine emphasizes that “barriers to vaccine access must be removed and evidence - based approaches to improving vaccine confidence and acceptance are essential” [ 7 , 8 ] . Multi‑level factors driving vaccine hesitancy and vaccine uptake : individual , structural , systemic , and technological “Vaccine uptake” is defined as the completion of a vac - cination series per administration schedule as recom - mended by medical experts and appropriate institutions . Vaccine uptake is complex and driven by individual - level factors , structural and systemic factors , and technologi - cal factors ; these impacts are amplified for underserved communities . Although vaccine uptake has increased , underserved communities have been historically over - looked by public health strategies tailored to resource - rich communities with predominantly English - speaking residents [ 9 ] . At the individual level , the research and popular lit - erature have increasingly focused on the concept of “vaccine hesitancy . ” Vaccine hesitancy refers to delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccination despite avail - ability of vaccination services [ 10 ] . Vaccine hesitancy is the midpoint in decision - making between vaccine refusal and acceptance and can be influenced by soci - etal / community norms , individual attitudes ( e . g . , com - placency , confidence ) , and structural factors ( e . g . , convenience , access ) [ 11 ] . A related term , “vaccine confidence , ” is defined as the belief that vaccines work , are safe , and are part of a trustworthy medical system Page 3 of 15 Rabin et al . Implementation Science ( 2023 ) 18 : 28 [ 12 ] . Factors driving vaccine hesitancy and confidence include medical distrust shaped by historical trauma rooted in biomedical research and continues to be rein - forced by current experiences of discrimination within medical encounters . The COVID - 19 pandemic has also prompted a deluge of information , opinion , and con - spiracies known as the “infodemic” which has played a significant role in vaccine hesitancy [ 13 ] . Rapid and widespread sharing of both evidence - based and inac - curate information about COVID - 19 and vaccines leads some people to inaction . This has been particularly sali - ent in Spanish - language social media [ 14 – 17 ] . Vaccine hesitancy or confidence at the individual level is one , but often not the most , important explanatory variable of vaccine uptake [ 13 ] . Additional factors driving uptake are largely related to access , including structural and systemic barriers . The pandemic has created an overall reduction in timeliness of immunizations and preventive service completion [ 18 , 19 ] and underscored an urgent need to overcome structural barriers preventing certain populations from accessing high quality , convenient , and affordable healthcare . “Preventive services” are defined as routine , guideline - concordant health care that includes chronic health screenings , check - ups , and patient counseling to prevent illnesses , disease , or other health problems [ 20 ] . Vaccine distribution is tra - ditionally embedded within existing healthcare infra - structure that is inequitably designed and inadequately funded . Even among those with a healthcare provider , studies show that BIPOC tend to receive lower - quality healthcare than white people after controlling for insur - ance status , income , age , and condition severity [ 21 ] . As a vaccine comparison , influenza vaccination rates are consistently lower among Black , Latino , and Asian American persons , as well as individuals of lower soci - oeconomic status ( SES ) , compared with their white and higher SES counterparts [ 22 ] . San Diego residents that are particularly impacted by barriers to healthcare access include undocumented residents , isolated com - munity members , individuals whose preferred language is not English , or those who need transportation and access accommodations . Systemic and logistical factors also impact access to the COVID - 19 vaccine . The digital divide ( i . e . , differential access to technology needed to schedule appointments and obtain updated health information ) precludes a size - able portion of the population from accessing web - based scheduling portals to set up vaccination appointments . Individuals also need to access information in their pre - ferred languages to make informed decisions about vac - cination and to schedule vaccination appointments . Compounding these structural factors , concerns about the need to take sick or unpaid leave , or secure childcare , due to vaccine side effects might negatively impact vac - cine uptake . Promise of implementation science in addressing vaccine hesitancy and uptake for underserved communities Addressing COVID - 19 vaccine hesitancy to promote equitable and sustained vaccination for underserved communities requires a multi - level , scalable , and sustain - able approach . It is also essential that efforts acknowledge the broader healthcare needs of underserved communi - ties including engagement in preventive services [ 23 – 25 ] . The current study builds on the project team’s commu - nity - engaged infrastructure to conduct a hybrid type 3 effectiveness - implementation trial [ 26 , 27 ] to examine the impact of a co - created multicomponent implemen - tation strategy on increased and sustained COVID - 19 vaccination and engagement in preventive services for underserved communities within a FQHC network . This work will combine methods from implementa - tion science , health equity research , and community engagement . Implementation strategies This study is a hybrid type 3 effectiveness - implemen - tation trial in which the evidence - based interventions are COVID - 19 vaccines and age - and gender - specific recommended preventive care services . The three implementation strategies that support the uptake of these evidence - based interventions are as follows : ( 1 ) co - creation with community advisory boards ( CABs ) led by Community Weavers , ( 2 ) the use of mobile health ( mHealth ) technologies for health communi - cation , and ( 3 ) care coordination . The next section provides a brief overview of each implementation strategy . Co‑creation with CABs led by Community Weavers Meaningful community engagement is an important factor in facilitating the uptake , implementation , and sustained use of interventions designed to address health inequities [ 28 , 29 ] . Community engagement , however , is not a trivial task , especially when working with communities representing diverse cultural herit - ages and languages and whose voices have historically been silenced [ 30 , 31 ] . In the creation of community - vetted solutions to inequitable vaccine distribution and uptake , as well as access to preventive services , it is crit - ical to utilize approaches that acknowledge and address these historical patterns [ 32 ] . Community Weavers are individuals with lived experience as a member of Page 4 of 15 Rabin et al . Implementation Science ( 2023 ) 18 : 28 an underserved community who serve as cultural bro - kers between communities , public health systems , and researchers to co - create community - driven , culturally sensitive public health solutions [ 33 , 34 ] . Community Weavers can bridge the gap between the underserved community and the mainstream public health systems and support research and clinical partners in learning about the priorities , preferences , needs , and strengths of the community , which can lead to solutions that are culturally sensitive and responsive [ 34 ] . They can also support the engagement of community members in health care , including COVID - 19 vaccination and other preventive services . The Global Action Research Center ( ARC ) , a nonprofit social change organization with expertise conducting participatory action research to address public health needs and a trusted resource for many of the grassroots organizations , will be the key lead in identifying , training , and engaging our Com - munity Weavers in this project . A key component in this process is to engage in co - creation of solutions with members of the community . Co - creation builds on the concepts of bidirectional learning and shared deci - sion - making and relies on the expertise brought by all members of the team [ 35 , 36 ] . Co - creation has been successfully used in diverse contexts , and programs that incorporate co - creation tend to have better uptake , more comprehensive implementation , and lead to more sustained positive outcomes [ 37 – 39 ] . Co - creation has been at the heart of our prior community - engaged COVID - 19 research with our community and clinical partners to meaningfully engage diverse community members in participatory methods . Use of mobile health ( mHealth ) technologies for health communication Lessons addressing challenges with vaccine distribution and vaccine hesitancy can be drawn from decades of vaccine campaign research from low - or middle - income countries ( LMICs ) through reverse innovation . Reverse innovation involves replicating an innovation that was originally developed for use in LMIC settings and translating to a high - income country [ 40 ] . Tradition - ally in clinical research , innovation is scaled from high - resource settings to low - resource settings , resulting in predictable challenges with resource limitations impact - ing feasibility . Reverse innovation allows researchers to derive insights from LMIC implementation research and innovatively adapt for higher - income settings . Given the importance of trust in promoting vaccine uptake , the current study will amplify the voices of trusted local leaders within historically disadvantaged commu - nities . Emerging research illustrates the popularity of mHealth interventions to extend service capacity and reach , promote healthcare engagement , reduce stigma , and promote vaccine acceptance [ 41 ] . The use of digital health products has significantly increased during the COVID - 19 pandemic era [ 42 ] . Important considera - tions for the implementation of mHealth in real - world settings include technology literacy , personalization of interventions , and perceptions of health risk and status [ 43 ] . We will address these considerations to inform the appropriate selection of implementation strategies tai - lored for context and implementation phase [ 44 ] . Care coordination In addition to information on vaccine effectiveness and access through mHealth strategies , additional support with more intense coordination might be needed for some community members . Care coordination is an evi - dence - based practice that is widely recognized as a core component of high - quality care [ 45 ] . It is also a pillar of the patient - centered medical home ( PCMH ) , which is a model of primary care increasingly adopted by health - care systems , including FQHCs , to meet the needs of diverse patients and to improve experiences , outcomes , safety , and system efficiency for patients , providers , and staff members [ 46 , 47 ] . We define care coordination as “the deliberate organization of patient care activities between two or more participants involved in a patient’s care to facilitate the appropriate delivery of health care services” [ 48 – 50 ] . Through personalized health educa - tion and care management and collaborative problem - solving , care coordinators will work with patients to develop and achieve a health action plan in collaboration with their primary care physician . The National Com - mittee for Quality Assurance ( NCQA ) leads the most widely adopted evaluation program for PCMH accredi - tation , called the NCQA Recognition program [ 51 ] . Our FQHC healthcare partner has successfully obtained and maintained NCQA recognition , due , in part , to their care coordination program . This study will expand eligibility for care coordination to target reduction of outstanding preventive services , including but not limited to diabe - tes and cancer screenings , and influenza vaccination , and offer co - created enhancements to maximize cultural relevance to priority patient communities served by the FQHC . Taken together , these three implementation strategies — co - creation led by Community Weavers , mHealth , and care coordination — have strong potential to accel - erate efforts to sustain COVID - 19 vaccination uptake and recommended use of preventive services . Research indicates that social determinants of health , such as low SES , educational level , and access to transportation , along with identifying as members of immigrant , refugee , Latino , and BIPOC communities , reduce one’s likelihood Page 5 of 15 Rabin et al . Implementation Science ( 2023 ) 18 : 28 to engage in evidence - based preventive services [ 52 , 53 ] . As a response to the COVID - 19 pandemic , many preven - tive services were delayed , resulting in more members of underserved communities having overdue preventive service needs [ 54 ] . Through a multicomponent health program , COVID - 19 vaccination will be coupled with engagement of members of underserved communities in broader preventive services . Engagement in preven - tive services will be addressed through all components of the program including co - creation of strategies , mHealth outreach , and care coordination . Combining care coordi - nation with culturally relevant , linguistically appropriate , and co - created mHealth health promotion messages offer a powerful approach to both facilitating vaccine equity and preventive services engagement . Theory of change and implementation science framework Our study is guided by a theory of change developed by our team through our National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) - funded research studies and the practical , robust implementation , and sustainability model ( PRISM ) . Theory of change ( ToC ) The multicomponent health program will be informed by an overarching ToC that was developed based on the team’s prior work with two CABs . The goal of the CO - CREATE CAB was to directly inform co - created imple - mentation strategies for a tailored COVID - 19 testing program and included 22 members representing com - munity residents , public health researchers , and clini - cal partners . The goal of the STOP COVID - 19 CA CAB was to inform materials and resources needed to support vaccine clinical trial participation and equity initiatives in underserved communities and included 11 commu - nity leaders representing ten local grassroots community organizations and two policy partners [ 23 , 24 ] . ToCs have been broadly used to guide the planning , implementation , and evaluation of public health programs in low - resource settings and provide a comprehensive description of how and why a desired change is expected to happen in a par - ticular context [ 55 , 56 ] . In these two COVID - 19 projects , a rigorous , multistep process was used to create a sepa - rate ToC for each CAB [ 24 ] which were overlaid to create an overarching , combined ToC . This combined ToC will be confirmed and refined and used to inform our strategy selection and implementation and evaluation planning . Practical , Robust Implementation , and Sustainability Model The Practical , Robust Implementation , and Sustainability Model ( PRISM ) will guide the optimization , implemen - tation , and evaluation of our multicomponent health program [ 57 , 58 ] . PRISM allows for multi - level conceptu - alization of implementation efforts ( context domains ) and also provides guidance on how to measure relevant proxi - mal implementation outcomes through integration of the RE - AIM measures ( reach , effectiveness , adoption , imple - mentation , maintenance ) — one of the most widely used sets of implementation measures [ 59 ] . PRISM is ideal for guiding our real - world community - based research pro - ject because it accounts for multi - level effects ; it builds on several implementation science frameworks and can guide development , implementation , and evaluation . Multiple levels of context will be considered : recipient characteristics ( community members and delivery agents — Community Weavers and care coordinators ) , inter - vention characteristics ( perceived by diverse partners ) , implementation and sustainability infrastructure within communities and clinics , and the external environment ( national guidelines and regulations ) . These factors will be considered during the co - creation and optimization of the multicomponent health program and assessed dynamically across the lifetime of the study . Several stud - ies show that the reach , adoption , implementation , and sustainment of interventions are related to how well the intervention is integrated into the local context [ 59 – 61 ] . These factors will be assessed in addition to effectiveness , using the reach , effectiveness , adoption , implementation , and maintenance ( RE - AIM ) framework . Aims The specific aims of the study are as follows : • Aim 1 : Optimize a multicomponent health program to promote COVID - 19 vaccine uptake and engage - ment in preventive healthcare using our established co - creation approach to address multi - level ( individ - ual , community , systemic ) barriers to vaccine uptake and preventive services engagement . • Aim 2 : Evaluate the implementation , effectiveness , and sustainment of the multicomponent COVID - 19 vaccine and preventive services engagement program using a hybrid type 3 effectiveness - implementation sequential multiple assignment randomized trial ( SMART ) design across immigrant , refugee , Latino , and BIPOC communities in Central , North , and East San Diego . Methods Design We will optimize , implement , and test the impact of a multicomponent health program that includes three implementation strategies : co - creation led by Commu - nity Weavers , mHealth outreach , and care coordination ( described earlier ) . A participatory approach will be used Page 6 of 15 Rabin et al . Implementation Science ( 2023 ) 18 : 28 to engage community members in co - creating and opti - mizing mHealth outreach and care coordination program components ( Aim 1 ) . A hybrid type 3 effectiveness - implementation SMART design will assess the impact of the multicomponent health program on implementa - tion and clinical outcome measures ( Aim 2 ) [ 62 , 63 ] . See Fig . 1 for the study’s conceptual model . Through the team’s ongoing community - engaged COVID - 19 studies and guided by PRISM , determinants that underlie COVID - 19 testing and vaccine dispari - ties in underserved communities ( immigrant , refugee , BIPOC , and Latino families ) were identified . These deter - minants include unique explanatory models of health and COVID - 19 ( intervention PRISM domain ) , structural and systemic challenges to vaccination and preventive services engagement ( implementation and sustainability infrastructure PRISM domain ) , FDA - approved or author - ized COVID - 19 vaccines available to all adults ( external environment PRISM domain ) , and the varying needs and characteristics of underserved communities located in our target geographic regions ( recipients PRISM domain ) . It is hypothesized that the selected implementa - tion strategies will exert their impact on implementation and clinical outcomes through vaccine confidence and service navigation support ( mechanisms ) . Implemen - tation outcomes are based on RE - AIM and expected to affect our clinical outcomes ( effectiveness ) . Clinical outcomes are based on the Office of Dis - ease Prevention and Health Promotion’s Healthy Peo - ple 2020 objectives [ 64 ] . A hybrid type 3 design was selected because there is strong evidence for our clinical interventions ( highly effective COVID - 19 vaccines and evidence - based preventive services ) and effectiveness data for the selected implementation strategies delivered individually . The study’s experimental design follows a SMART randomized structure to introduce the more intensive care coordination component only to those who are not responding to usual care or the lower inten - sity and less - resource intensive mHealth messaging com - ponent allowing for more efficient resource allocation . The Community Weaver - led co - creation component will be included in both mHealth and care coordination since this component is at the heart of the meaningful commu - nity engagement and the Community Weaver’s role will be critical for both strategies . The multicomponent strategy is an adaptive approach that utilizes tailored mHealth messaging and care coor - dination to increase COVID - 19 vaccine uptake . The SMART assignment arms are described in Table 2 . The trial will span 4 years inclusive of 3 years of active implementation and 1 year of sustainment / maintenance . As outlined in Fig . 2 , both randomization and analy - sis will be conducted at the individual participant level . At enrollment , participants will be stratified by current COVID - 19 vaccination status and status of other preven - tive services vis - à - vis a risk score and then randomized into the first - stage intervention ( mHealth outreach or standard of care ) . Response or lack of response after the completion of the first stage intervention will determine if participants continue in their initial first - stage inter - vention or re - randomized to increased intensity inter - vention . Nonresponders in the standard of care arm Fig . 1 Conceptual model Page 7 of 15 Rabin et al . Implementation Science ( 2023 ) 18 : 28 will be equally re - randomized into either mHealth out - reach or care coordination for stage 2 . Nonresponders in mHealth outreach will be re - randomized into mHealth or mHealth plus care coordination for stage 2 . Nonresponse will be defined as not being up to date on COVID - 19 vaccination OR having at least one outstanding preven - tive service need . Setting This study will be conducted in partnership with the second largest FQHC serving low - income and unin - sured San Diegans and has a long - standing relationship with UC San Diego . This study will focus on clinics in Central , North , and East San Diego that serve refugee , immigrant , BIPOC , and Latino populations . San Diego has historically been one of the California counties with the highest number of immigrant and refugee families [ 65 ] . This FQHC has been successful in the early phases of COVID - 19 vaccine campaigns in many regions but anticipates challenges with sustaining the level of support needed to keep up with guidelines as policy changes supporting COVID - 19 vaccine efforts may wane in coming months and years . As shown in Table 1 , the three target clinics serve a racially / ethnically diverse patient population whose primary preferred languages are Vietnamese ( clinic 1 ) , Arabic ( clinic 2 ) , and Span - ish ( clinic 3 ) . Engagement in preventive services as shown by recommending screenings is lower than rec - ommended in all clinics . In addition , the FQHC has a robust care coordination program in place as part of their PCMH accreditation . Taken together , these factors well position the partnering FQHC to collaboratively deliver a multi - level community - focused intervention to support equitable vaccine uptake and preventive ser - vices engagement .

Implementation Science ( 2023 ) 18 : 28 Participants A total of 300 adult patients ( 100 per clinic ) , from a sampling frame of approximately 5000 patients , will be recruited to participate in the study . Patient recruitment will occur at each of the three participating FQHC clin - ics through collaborative efforts between the FQHC’s care coordinators and the Community Weavers . The CABs will be invited to co - develop culturally appropri - ate recruitment methods to ensure participation from Spanish , Arabic , and Vietnamese - speaking patients con - nected with the partnering FQHCs . A weighted sampling approach will be considered if patient volume varies con - siderably between the three clinics during the baseline period . Furthermore , to understand reach of the pro - gram , characteristics of those participating in the study will be compared to the population in each of the three geographic regions recruited into the study . Procedures Community engagement through CABs and Community Weavers The multicomponent strategy will be developed and opti - mized using the team’s established co - creation approach with guidance from the Community Weavers and engagement of the community through CABs . Commu - nity Weavers will be hired and supervised by the study’s community partner , the Global ARC , based on their established relationships with ethnically based commu - nity organizations . Hiring criteria for Community Weav - ers include that they are fluent in English and at least one of the three priority languages ( Spanish , Arabic , Viet - namese ) ; are engaged with communities living near one of the three partnering FQHC clinics ; have experience with community engagement , leading and organizing ; and have the capacity to share back knowledge and infor - mation with their community as well as share the com - munity’s perspectives and concerns with the CABs . Community Weavers will have a critical role in devel - oping and refining tailored mHealth messages [ 66 ] . They will also be instrumental in facilitating the existing care coordination efforts at the FQHC by focusing on immi - grant and refugee communities that can be difficult to engage in care . The Community Weavers will lead three CABs that include five members each inclusive of the three primary languages spoken by community members of our clinics of interest . CAB members will be compen - sated for their time . In addition to the five community members , we will include the two care coordinators , a mHealth Specialist , and two clinical investigators as non - voting members in each CAB . During the first year , each CAB will meet up to four times . These initial meetings will be tasked with co - cre - ating culturally and linguistically appropriate content and frequency for mHealth outreach and identifying topics , strategies , and processes for the care coordination pro - gram . mHealth outreach messages will be developed in the native languages of the CABs , and we will use pro - fessional translation as needed . To facilitate mHealth message development , Community Weavers will use a storytelling / narrative framework approach inviting residents to join open dialogue and share their journey through the decision - making process towards getting vaccinated , reflecting on the anxieties they navigated , the misinformation they were confronted with , and any structural or technological barriers they had to overcome to enhance the cultural resonance and tailoring of the mHealth messages [ 67 ] . In subsequent years , the CABs will continue meeting quarterly to revise and update mHealth content and engage in an Appreciative Inquiry Process to evaluate the implementation of the multicom - ponent health program and determine when refinements for optimization are needed . The co - creation and optimi - zation of the program components will be guided by the contextual domains of PRISM ( i . e . , intervention charac - teristics , recipient characteristics , implementation and sustainability infrastructure , external environment ) and will build on the team’s prior work with the community [ 24 , 31 ] and the CAB members’ lived experience as mem - bers of their respective communities . mHealth development and outreach mHealth - related communications will include person - alized short messaging service ( SMS ) and automated phone calls recorded by community leaders in their respective languages aligned with the language pref - erences of our target clinics . The content of mHealth outreach will include information such as how and where to get vaccinated , myths about COVID - 19 and other vaccines , the importance , timing , and scheduling of priority preventive services , and provide remind - ers for clinical care appointments . The study team includes an expert consultant in health communica - tions to guide message development . mHealth distri - bution frequency will be determined by each CAB to align with their community’s preferences and needs . New messages will be developed and added to the message library based on updated public health guid - ance and feedback from participants . The mHealth outreach system will be user tested and refined prior to launch . See Fig . 3 for a schematic of the mHealth outreach system . A mHealth specialist will lead the development of the mHealth delivery system by consulting with program - ming experts through Twilio to design and build a fully integrated , Health Insurance Portability and Accounta - bility Act ( HIPAA ) compliant communications platform Page 9 of 15 Rabin et al . Implementation Science ( 2023 ) 18 : 28 to manage the distribution of SMS and voice commu - nications . Twilio will allow customized communica - tions , develop production - ready applications , and run serverless applications on one application programming interface - powered platform . A centralized study data - base connected with the mHealth delivery system will track the number and timing of text and voice messages sent to individual participants . User analytics will be captured such as individual reach , responsiveness , and engagement . Example messages may include the follow - ing : “Proteja a sus seres queridos con vacunarse contra el COVID - 19” / “Protect your loved ones by getting the COVID - 19 vaccine” and “Recuerde pedir su vacuna contra la Influenza” / “Remember to ask for your flu shot . ” Care coordination The partnering FQHC has an established process to pro - vide care coordination ( see standard of care in Table 2 ) . The partnering FQHC will identify study - specific care coordinators who are members of the three study com - munities . Care coordination for the intervention will be tailored to the needs and cultural preferences of the respective patient community through input from our CABs . The content of care coordination will include engagement of patients in preventive services , devel - oping a patient health action plan , support with adher - ing to the health action plan , scheduling preventive and care management appointments , communicating with the patient’s care team to ensure continuity of care , and COVID - 19 vaccination . Measures Data will be collected using multiple sources to represent diverse perspectives using a QUANT + QUAL concur - rent mixed - method design approach . Data sources , type , source , and timing of collection as well as key implemen - tation and effectiveness outcomes are summarized in Tables 3 and 4 . Surveys and interviews with participants will be conducted in the participant’s preferred language . Participant surveys will be drafted with input from the CABs , pilot tested prior to implementation , and use elec - tronic or paper formats based on participant preferences . Interviews will be led by Community Weavers using a semi - structured interview guide reflecting PRISM domains adapted from prior studies [ 58 , 72 ] and vetted Fig . 3 Schematic of the mHealth outreach system Table 2 Summary of the Sequential , Multiple Assignment , Randomized Trial ( SMART ) design Standard of Care Multi‑component health program Aligned with patient - centered medical home components and quality - of - care measures Community Weaver led Co‑Creation Overarching strategy Care coordination mHealth Outreach • Routine immunization efforts • Annual physical exam • Eligibility : defined medical conditions ( e . g . , uncontrolled diabetes , hypertension ) , high health services utilization ( e . g . , > 5 medications ) , social determinants of health and referred by care team Community outreach led by Community Weavers via SMS and voice mes - sages about COVID - 19 vaccines ( importance , reminders , how to access ) and preventive services engagement ( importance , reminders , how to access ) in languages spoken by patients ( i . e . , Spanish , Arabic , Vietnamese ) Care Coordination Inclusiveof standard of care coordination with added focus on complet - ingoutstanding preventive services ( e . g . , HbA1c , blood pressurescreenings , mammograms , colorectal cancer screening ) Page 10 of 15 Rabin et al .

Standards will be defined for each partici - pant based on their demographic and health characteristics Page 11 of 15 Rabin et al . Implementation Science ( 2023 ) 18 : 28 will be evaluated using a concurrent mixed - methods approach developed through the team’s NIH - funded COVID - 19 projects [ 68 ] . A partner engagement survey ( Goodman et al . ) will be distributed following each CAB meeting to assess how well and how often eight engage - ment principles were perceived during the meeting [ 69 ] . Ethnographic documentation of the CAB process will be conducted by trained research staff using a struc - tured documentation form identifying various aspects of engagement ( e . g . , topics covered , time spent contribut - ing ) [ 25 ] . Power calculations Primary effectiveness outcomes will be COVID - 19 vac - cine ( initial and bivalent booster ) completion at a sus - tained rate of 70 % ( consistent with Healthy People 2020 influenza vaccination goal for adults aged 18 + years ) [ 70 ] . Secondary effectiveness outcomes will be an increase in preventive service engagement defined as completing a physical exam and at least one recom - mended preventive care screening ( e . g . , mammogram , A1c screening , colorectal cancer screening ) annually and increases in vaccine confidence . Data on other recom - mended adult immunizations ( e . g . , influenza , shingles ) will be extracted from patient electronic health records ( EHRs ) . Primary implementation outcomes will be reach , adoption , implementation , and maintenance up to 2 - year post - implementation . Target sample size was deter - mined using methods described by Kidwell et al . [ 71 ] for a SMART design with a binary outcome . A power analysis was conducted to inform our targeted sample size based on the following assumptions : ( 1 ) probability of success for adaptive health interventions of 0 . 70 ; ( 2 ) estimated response rate for standard of care of 0 . 45 ( cur - rent vaccination rate among target population ) ; and ( 3 ) equal re - randomization after first - stage intervention for nonresponders . Allowing for a 5 % type - 1 error and 80 % power , a sample size of at least 252 is needed to evaluate an effect size of 0 . 25 . Assuming a 15 % loss to follow - up during the 2 - year intervention period , our target enroll - ment of 300 participants will ensure sufficient sample size for analysis . Analytic approach Quantitative data from surveys , study databases , and EHRs will be summarized using simple descriptive sta - tistics along with data visualization methods to under - stand patterns and characteristics of responders and nonresponders and to guide adaptive implementation . Parametric and nonparametric tests will be employed to compare the survey responses between the arms of the trial variables and clinic locations . Factors will initially be assessed at the univariate level and then used to build multivariable models to assess independent associations of multiple factors on vaccination uptake , including com - munity level factors such as prevalence of COVID - 19 vaccination , history of COVID - 19 infection , and primary community language group . Multinomial logistic regres - sion models will explore the relation between standard of care , mHealth outreach , and mHealth plus care coordi - nation and COVID - 19 vaccine uptake , while controlling for a variety of demographic and socioeconomic vari - ables and comorbidities , as well as FQHC clinic charac - teristics . Additionally , the association between adaptive interventions and the secondary clinical composite out - come , preventive services engagement , including age and gender - specific services will be evaluated . Descriptive analysis will be used to characterize within subgroup dif - ferences . Mixed - effects logistic regression models will be used to identify factors associated with COVID - 19 vaccine uptake and vaccine confidence using EHR and demographic data collected with participant evaluation surveys . Qualitative data will be culled from interviews , peri - odic reflections , and study databases . All qualitative data will be coded using a rapid qualitative data analytic approach guided by the domains of PRISM , informed by prior work of the lead and senior authors across diverse contexts [ 58 , 72 , 73 ] . This approach involves developing a templated matrix of summary responses from inter - views , followed by coding by a qualitative analytic team based on pre - defined themes while allowing for new sub - themes to emerge [ 74 ] . Group coding for consensus building , team - based review of codes , and double cod - ing to verify acceptable inter - rater reliability will occur throughout the coding process . Community Weavers and clinic partners will be invited to review the coded data to support sense - making and develop action items based on the data . A matrix approach will be used to triangulate data from quantitative and qualitative sources using the key domains of PRISM . A joint display analysis will be pro - duced to support the integration of data sources [ 75 , 76 ] . Unique and common themes across language groups will be identified and described . Discussion This implementation study capitalizes on the unique and complementary methods from community engagement , implementation science , health equity , health communi - cation , infectious disease , and public health to co - create a multicomponent strategy to promote sustained uptake of effective public health approaches of COVID - 19 vac - cination and preventive services engagement for under - served communities in San Diego . This proposal extends the team’s current work [ 23 , 24 , 77 ] using a generalizable Page 12 of 15 Rabin et al . Implementation Science ( 2023 ) 18 : 28 co - creation approach to focus on scaling and sustaining COVID - 19 and broader health equity for immigrant , ref - ugee , Latino , and BIPOC communities . This study will contribute to the limited evidence base in implementation science on public health scaling and sustainment strategies by conducting a hybrid type 3 effectiveness - implementation study on a multicompo - nent strategy co - created with community leaders , resi - dents , and frontline providers . Limited research exists on sustainment strategies so the explicit focus on scaling and sustaining will contribute to the field of implemen - tation science by adding evidence to health equity - pro - moting sustainment strategies . This study will include a multi - level mixed - methods data collection approach at multiple time points guided by an implementation sci - ence model and is designed to assess sustained impact of our multicomponent program with a 12 - month fol - low - up period . An adaptive implementation approach operationalized in a SMART design will be used to allow deployment of various components of our multicompo - nent program over time depending on the response to prior components . This approach will facilitate under - standing the impact of various intervention components and delivering more intensive support those who benefit from it most . Finally , while the mHealth messaging will target COVID - 19 vaccines and boosters , generalizable knowledge will be garnered that may support develop - ment of messages for other immunizations if this inter - vention is to be expanded and scaled . Balanced with these innovative features are potential challenges and limitations . Based on the team’s ongoing COVID - 19 work , a primary challenge will be balanc - ing reach with resource constraints . The underserved communities who reside in the partnering FQHC clinic regions are diverse in their cultures , languages , explana - tory models of health and COVID - 19 , and healthcare needs . It will not be possible to engage all immigrant , ref - ugee , and BIPOC communities through our co - created health program . However , the team will rely on the dec - ades of community engaged participatory action research led by the Global ARC to successfully reach a diverse range of immigrant and refugee communities in ways that are meaningful , sustainable and resource appropri - ate , and leverage the quality care and clinical research supported by the partnering FQHC to reduce health dis - parities in their patient population . This study has great potential to contribute to imple - mentation science through the operationalization of a relatively infrequently operationalized SMART design , the use of longitudinal , multi - level , and mixed - meth - ods data collection informed by an implementation science framework , and the use of innovative imple - mentation strategies of co - creation through CABs led by Community Weavers and care coordination . It is expected that the study will have meaningful popula - tion health impact by increasing COVID - 19 vaccine and preventive services uptake for key historically under - served populations . Furthermore , findings of this study have potential to uniquely unpack the phenomenon of health and vaccine misinformation that was exacerbated through the COVID - 19 pandemic [ 78 ] . In closing , this study has potential implications beyond a narrow focus on COVID - 19 disparities reduction to influence broader public health implementation efforts for underserved communities .
