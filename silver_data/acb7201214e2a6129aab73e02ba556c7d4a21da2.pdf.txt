Genome Biology 2011 , 12 : R91 http : / / genomebiology . com / 2011 / 12 / 9 / R91 ( 21 September 2011 ) RESEARCH Open Access SHROOM3 is a novel candidate for heterotaxy identified by whole exome sequencing Muhammad Tariq 1 , John W Belmont 2 , Seema Lalani 2 , Teresa Smolarek 3 and Stephanie M Ware 1 , 3 * Abstract Background : Heterotaxy - spectrum cardiovascular disorders are challenging for traditional genetic analyses because of clinical and genetic heterogeneity , variable expressivity , and non - penetrance . In this study , high - resolution SNP genotyping and exon - targeted array comparative genomic hybridization platforms were coupled to whole - exome sequencing to identify a novel disease candidate gene . Results : SNP genotyping identified absence - of - heterozygosity regions in the heterotaxy proband on chromosomes 1 , 4 , 7 , 13 , 15 , 18 , consistent with parental consanguinity . Subsequently , whole - exome sequencing of the proband identified 26 , 065 coding variants , including 18 non - synonymous homozygous changes not present in dbSNP132 or 1000 Genomes . Of these 18 , only 4 - one each in CXCL2 , SHROOM3 , CTSO , RXFP1 - were mapped to the absence - of - heterozygosity regions , each of which was flanked by more than 50 homozygous SNPs , confirming recessive segregation of mutant alleles . Sanger sequencing confirmed the SHROOM3 homozygous missense mutation and it was predicted as pathogenic by four bioinformatic tools . SHROOM3 has been identified as a central regulator of morphogenetic cell shape changes necessary for organogenesis and can physically bind ROCK2 , a rho kinase protein required for left - right patterning . Screening 96 sporadic heterotaxy patients identified four additional patients with rare variants in SHROOM3 . Conclusions : Using whole exome sequencing , we identify a recessive missense mutation in SHROOM3 associated with heterotaxy syndrome and identify rare variants in subsequent screening of a heterotaxy cohort , suggesting SHROOM3 as a novel target for the control of left - right patterning . This study reveals the value of SNP genotyping coupled with high - throughput sequencing for identification of high yield candidates for rare disorders with genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity . Background Congenital heart disease ( CHD ) is the most common major birth defect , affecting an estimated 1 in 130 live births [ 1 ] . However , the underlying genetic causes are not identified in the vast majority of cases [ 2 , 3 ] . Of these , approximately 25 % are syndromic while approxi - mately 75 % are isolated . Heterotaxy is a severe form of CHD , a multiple congenital anomaly syndrome resulting from abnormalities of the proper specification of left - right ( LR ) asymmetry during embryonic development , and can lead to malformation of any organ that is asym - metric along the LR axis . Heterotaxy is classically asso - ciated with heart malformations , anomalies of the visceral organs such as gut malrotation , abnormalities of spleen position or number , and situs anomalies of the liver and / or stomach . In addition , inappropriate reten - tion of symmetric embryonic structures ( for example , persistent left superior vena cava ) , or loss of normal asymmetry ( for example , right atrial isomerism ) are clues to an underlying disorder of laterality [ 4 , 5 ] . Heterotaxy is the most highly heritable cardiovascular malformation [ 6 ] . However , the majority of heterotaxy cases are considered idiopathic and their genetic basis remains unknown . To date , point mutations in more than 15 genes have been identified in humans with het - erotaxy or heterotaxy - spectrum CHD . Although their prevalence is not known with certainty , they most likely account for approximately 15 % of heterotaxy spectrum disorders [ 4 , 7 - 9 ] . Human X - linked heterotaxy is caused by loss of function mutations in ZIC3 , and accounts for * Correspondence : stephanie . ware @ cchmc . org 1 Division of Molecular Cardiovascular Biology , Cincinnati Children ’ s Hospital Medical Center , 3333 Burnet Avenue , Cincinnati , OH 45229 , USA Full list of author information is available at the end of the article Tariq et al .

Thus , despite the strong genetic contribution to heterotaxy , the majority of cases remain unexplained and this indi - cates the need for utilization of novel genomic approaches to identify genetic causes of these heritable disorders . LR patterning is a very important feature of early embryonic development . The blueprint for the left and right axes is established prior to organogenesis and is followed by transmission of positional information to the developing organs . Animal models have been critical for identifying key signaling pathways necessary for the initiation and maintenance of LR development . Asym - metric expression of Nodal , a transforming growth fac - tor beta ligand , was identified as an early molecular marker of LR patterning that is conserved across species [ 10 - 12 ] . Genes in the Nodal signaling pathway account for the majority of genes currently known to cause human heterotaxy . However , the phenotypic variability of heterotaxy and frequent sporadic inheritance pattern have been challenging for studies using traditional genetic approaches . Although functional analyses of rare variants in the Nodal pathway have been performed that confirm their deleterious nature , in many cases these variants are inherited from unaffected parents , suggest - ing that they function as susceptibility alleles in the con - text of the whole pathway [ 7 , 8 ] . More recent studies have focused on pathways upstream of Nodal signaling , including ion channels and electrochemical gradients [ 13 - 15 ] , ciliogenesis and intra - flagellar transport [ 16 ] , planar cell polarity ( Dvl2 / 3 , Nkd1 ) [ 17 , 18 ] and convergence extension ( Vangl1 / 2 , Rock2 ) [ 19 , 20 ] , and non - transforming growth factor beta pathway members that interact with the Nodal signaling pathway ( for example , Ttrap , Geminin , Cited2 ) [ 21 - 23 ] . Relevant to the current study , we recently identified a rare copy number variant containing ROCK2 in a patient with heterotaxy and showed that its knockdown in Xeno - pus causes laterality defects [ 24 ] . Similar laterality defects were identified separately with knockdown of Rock2b in zebrafish [ 20 ] . The emergence of additional pathways regulating LR development has led to new candidates for further evaluation . Given the mutational spectrum of het - erotaxy , we hypothesize that whole - exome approaches will be useful for the identification of novel candidates and essential for understanding the contribution of sus - ceptibility alleles to disease penetrance . Very recently , whole - exome analysis has been used successfully to identify the causative genes for many rare disorders in affected families with small pedigrees and even in singlet inherited cases or unrelated sporadic cases [ 25 - 29 ] . Nevertheless , one of the challenges of whole - exome sequencing is the interpretation of the large number of variants identified . Homozygosity mapping is one approach that is useful for delineating regions of interest . A combined approach of homozyg - osity mapping coupled with partial or whole - exome ana - lysis has been used successfully in identification of disease - causing genes in recessive conditions focusing on variants within specific homozygous regions of the genome [ 30 - 32 ] . Here we use SNP genotyping coupled to a whole - exome sequencing strategy to identify a novel candidate for heterotaxy in a patient with a com - plex heterotaxy syndrome phenotype . We further evalu - ate SHROOM3 in an additional 96 patients from our heterotaxy cohort and identify four rare variants , two of which are predicted to be pathogenic . Results Phenotypic evaluation Previously we presented a classification scheme for het - erotaxy in which patients were assigned to categories , including syndromic heterotaxy , classic heterotaxy , or heterotaxy spectrum CHD [ 9 ] . Using these classifica - tions , patient LAT1180 was given a diagnosis of a novel complex heterotaxy syndrome based on CHD , visceral , and other associated anomalies . Clinical features include dextrocardia , L - transposition of the great arteries , abdominal situs inversus , bilateral keratoconus , and sen - sorineural hearing loss ( Table 1 ) . The parents of this female proband are first cousins , suggesting the possibi - lity of an autosomal recessive condition . Chromosome microarray analysis LAT1180 was assessed for submicroscopic chromosomal abnormalities using an Illumina genome - wide SNP array as well as exon - targeted array comparative genomic hybridization ( aCGH ) . Copy number variation ( CNV ) analysis did not identify potential disease - causing chro - mosomal deletions / duplications . However , several absence - of - heterozygosity regions ( homozygous runs ) were identified via SNP genotyping analysis ( Table 2 and Figure 1 ) , consistent with the known consanguinity in the pedigree . These regions have an overwhelming prob - ability to carry disease mutations in inbred families [ 33 ] .

These included one variant each in CXCL2 ( p . T39A ; chr4 : 74 , 964 , 625 ) , SHROOM3 ( p . G60V ; chr4 : 77 , 476 , 772 ) , CTSO ( p . Q122E ; chr4 : 156 , 863 , 489 ) , and RXFP1 ( p . T235I ; chr4 : 159 , 538 , 306 ) . Previously , we developed an approach for prioritiza - tion of candidate genes for heterotaxy spectrum cardio - vascular malformations and laterality disorders based on developmental expression and gene function [ 24 ] . In addition , we have developed a network biology analysis appropriate for evaluation of candidates relative to potential interactions with known genetic pathways for heterotaxy , LR patterning , and ciliopathies in animal models and humans ( manuscript in preparation ) . Using these approaches , three of the genes , CXCL2 , CTSO , and RXFP1 , are considered unlikely candidates . CXCL2 is an inducible chemokine important for chemotaxis , immune response , and inflammatory response . Targeted deletion of Cxcl2 in mice does not cause congenital anomalies but does result in poor wound healing and increased susceptibility to infection [ 35 ] .

It is expressed ubiqui - tously postnatally and in the brain prenatally . RFXP1 ( also known as LRG7 ) is a G - protein coupled receptor to which the ligand relaxin binds . It is expressed ubiqui - tously with the exception of the spleen . Mouse Genome Informatics shows that homozygous deletion of Rfxp1 leads to males with reduced fertility and females unable to nurse due to impaired nipple development . In con - trast , SHROOM3 is considered a very strong candidate based on its known expression and function , including its known role in gut looping and its ability to bind ROCK2 . Further analysis of the SHROOM3 gene confirmed a homozygous missense mutation ( Table 4 and Figure 3 ) in a homozygous run on chromosome 4 . These data support the recessive segregation of the variant with the phenotype . This mutation was confirmed by Sanger sequencing ( Figure 4c ) and was predicted to create a cryptic splice acceptor site , which may cause loss of exon 2 of the gene . Pathogenicity prediction The homozygous mutation p . G60V in SHROOM3 was predicted to be pathogenic using the bioinformatic pro - grams Polyphen - 2 [ 36 ] , PANTHER [ 37 ] , Mutation Taster [ 38 ] and SIFT [ 39 ] . Glycine at position 60 of SHROOM3 as well as its respective triplet codon ( GGG ) in the gene are evolutionarily conserved across species , suggesting an important role of this residue in protein function ( Figure 4a , b ) . Mutation Taster [ 38 ] predicted loss of the PDZ domain ( 25 to 110 amino acids ) and probable loss of remaining regions of SHROOM3 pro - tein due to the cryptic splicing effect of the c . 179G > T mutation in the gene ( Figure 5 ) . Variants in CTSO , RFXP1 , and CXCL2 were predicted to be benign by more than two of the above bioinformatic programs . Mutation screening SHROOM3 was analyzed in 96 sporadic heterotaxy patients with unknown genetic etiology for their disease using PCR amplification followed by Sanger sequencing . Four nonsynonymous nucleotide changes were identified ( Table 5 and Figure 6 ) that were not present in the HapMap or 1000 Genomes databases , indicating they are rare variants . Each variant was analyzed using Poly - Phen , SIFT , and PANTHER . Both homozygous variants p . D537N and p . E1775K were predicted to be benign by all programs , whereas the heterozygous variants p . P173H and p . G1864D were identified as damaging by all programs . Discussion In the present study , we investigated a proband , LAT1180 , from a consanguineous pedigree with a novel form of heterotaxy syndrome using microarray - based CNV analysis and whole - exome sequencing . Our initial genetic analysis using two microarray - based platforms ( Illumina SNP genotyping and exon - targeted Agilent aCGH ) failed to identify any potential structural muta - tion . However , we observed homozygous regions ( absence - of - heterozygosity ) from SNP genotyping data , suggesting that homozygous point mutations or small insertion / deletion events within these regions could be disease associated . Subsequently , whole - exome analysis resulted in the identification of a novel homozygous missense mutation in the SHROOM3 gene on chromo - some 4 . Additional sequencing in a cohort of 96 hetero - taxy patients identified two additional patients with homozygous variants and two patients with heterozy - gous variants . Although in vivo loss of function analyses have demonstrated the importance of SHROOM3 for proper cardiac and gut patterning , specific testing of the variants identified herein will be useful to further estab - lish pathogenicity and the most common mode of inheritance . This study demonstrates the usefulness of high - throughput sequencing and SNP genotyping to identify important candidates in disorders characterized by genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity . SHROOM3 encodes a cytoskeletal protein of 1 , 996 residues that is composed of 3 main domains with dis - tinct functions ( Figure 5 ) . SHROOM3 , an actin binding protein , is responsible for early cell shape during mor - phogenesis through a myosin II - dependent pathway . It is essential for neural tube closure in mouse , Xenopus , and chick [ 40 - 42 ] . Early studies in model species showed that Shroom3 plays an important role in the morpho - genesis of epithelial sheets , such as gut epithelium , lens placode invagination , and also cardiac development [ 43 , 44 ] . Recent data indicate an important role for Shroom3 in proper gut rotation [ 45 ] . Interestingly , gut malrotation is a common feature of heterotaxy and is consistent with a laterality disorder . In Xenopus , Shroom3 is expressed in the myocardium and is neces - sary for cellular morphogenesis in the early heart as well as normal cardiac tube formation with disruption of car - diac looping ( Thomas Drysdale , personal communica - tion , manuscript in revision ) . Downstream effector proteins of Shroom3 include Mena , myosin II , Rap1 GTPase and Rho Kinases [ 40 - 42 , 44 , 46 ] . Shroom3 may play an important role in LR develop - ment acting downstream of Pitx2 . Pitx2 is an important transcription factor in the generation of LR patterning in Xenopus , zebrafish , and mice [ 47 - 49 ] . Recently it was shown that Pitx2 can directly activate expression of Shroom3 and ultimately chiral gut looping in Xenopus [ 43 ] . Gut looping morphogenesis in Xenopus is most likely driven by cell shape changes in gut epithelium [ 50 ] . The identification of Shroom3 as a downstream Tariq et al . Genome Biology 2011 , 12 : R91 http : / / genomebiology . com / 2011 / 12 / 9 / R91 Page 5 of 12 effector fills an important gap in understanding how positional information is transferred into morphogenetic movements during organogenesis . The presence of a Pitx2 binding - sites upstream of mouse Shroom3 com - bined with the similar gut looping phenotypes of mouse Pitx2 and Shroom3 mutants supports the interactive mechanism for these two proteins [ 41 , 43 , 51 ] . Studies from snails , frogs and mice suggest cell - shape / arrangement regulation and cytoskeleton - driven polarity is initiated early during development , establishing LR asymmetry [ 19 , 52 - 55 ] . Recent data from our lab and others demonstrated that rho kinase ( ROCK2 ) , a down - stream effector protein of SHROOM3 , is required for LR and anteroposterior patterning in humans , Xenopus and zebrafish [ 20 , 24 ] . In animal models , either overex - pression or loss of function may cause similar pheno - types . These results led us to suggest that this pathway ( Figure 7 ) , which is a central regulator of morphogenetic cell shape changes , may be a novel target for the control of LR patterning . Sequencing of these newly identified genes downstream of the canonical Nodal signal trans - duction pathway will be necessary to determine their Figure 3 Alignment of exome high - throughput sequencing data showing SHROOM3 gene mutation c . 179G > T bordered by red vertical lines .

This study highlights the importance of microarray - based SNP / CNV genotyping followed by exome sequencing for identification of novel candidates .

The resulting exome library of the proband was sequenced with 50 bp paired - end reads using Illumina GAII ( v2 Chemistry ) . Data are archived at the NCBI Sequence Read Archive ( SRA ) under an NCBI accession number [ NCBI : SRP007801 ] [ 34 ] . All sequence reads were mapped to the reference human genome ( UCSC hg 19 ) using the Illumina Pipeline software version 1 . 5 featuring a gapped aligner ( ELAND v2 ) . Variant identifi - cation was performed using locally developed software ‘ SeqMate ’ ( submitted for publication ) . The tool com - bines the aligned reads with the reference sequence and computes a distribution of call quality at each aligned base position , which serves as the basis for variant call - ing . Variants are reported based on a configurable for - mula using the following additional parameters : depth of coverage , proportion of each base at a given position and number of different reads showing a sequence varia - tion . The minimum number of high quality bases to establish coverage at any position was arbitrarily set at 10 . Any sequence position with a non - reference base observed more than 75 % of the time was called a homo - zygous variant . Any sequence position with a non - refer - ence base observed between 25 % and 75 % of the time was called a heterozygous variant . Amino acid changes were identified by comparison to the UCSC RefSeq database track . A local realignment tool was used to minimize the errors in SNP calling due to indels . A ser - ies of filtering strategies ( dbSNP132 , 1000 Genomes pro - ject ( May 2010 ) ) were applied to reduce the number of variants and to identify the potential pathogenic muta - tions causing the disease phenotype . Mutation screening and validation Primers were designed to cover exonic regions contain - ing potential variants of SHROOM3 and UGT2A1 genes in LAT1180 . For screening additional heterotaxy patients , primers were designed to include all exons and splice junctions of SHROOM3 ( primer sequences are available upon request ) . A homozygous nonsense variant ( p . Y192X ) was confirmed in the UGT2A1 gene within Leftys Nodal Activin receptors type I / II ( Cytoplasm ) SMAD2 / 3 / 4 ( Nucleus ) FOXH1 / Mixer ( TFs ) Pitx2 Shroom3 < - - - - Cytoskeleton driven Rock1 / 2 Cell shape / contractility LR organ patterning Figure 7 Proposed model for Shroom3 involvement in LR patterning . Flow diagram illustrating key interactions in early embryonic LR development . Nodal is expressed asymmetrically at the left of the node ( mouse ) , gastrocoel roof plate ( Xenopus ) or Kuppfer ’ s vesicle ( zebrafish ) , followed by asymmetric Nodal expression in the left lateral plate mesoderm . Pitx proteins bind the Shroom3 promoter to activate expression . Studies from animal models also suggest a role of cytoskeleton - driven polarity in LR asymmetry establishment .

PCR products were sequenced using BigDye Terminator and an ABI 3730XL DNA Analyzer . Sequence analysis was performed via Bioedit Sequence Alignment Editor , version 6 . 0 . 7 [ 59 ] . All positive find - ings were confirmed in a separate experiment using the original genomic DNA sample as template for new amplification and bi - directional sequencing reactions .
