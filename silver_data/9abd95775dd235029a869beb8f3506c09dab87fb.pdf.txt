INTRODUCTION The last centuries are marked by an increasing reliance on technology to take over more and more labor . During the last decades , this trend has markedly accelerated , especially in terms of information processing and intellectual work . ( Personal ) computing and information systems are a pervasive element of today’s workplace , whether it be individual or groupwork . Consequently , a large research stream on information systems as a means of work has emerged ( e . g . [ 61 ] ) . In addition to individual versus collaborative work , use of IS has sprawled from tasks directly related to data processing , e . g . accounting , to more general areas . Tasks involving innovation and creating new ideas are an example of such tasks . Creative and inventive tasks are a particularly important type of work since generating ideas and innovative propositions are key to competitive advantage [ 62 ] . Creative methodologies are used on a wide range of topics such as digital innovation in healthcare [ 45 ] . Creative efforts can be carried out using original creativity methods , methods from other areas such as agile development [ 46 ] , and can be supported by a variety of information systems : Either by standard software , e . g . office applications , specific tools , e . g . computer aided design , or specialized systems aimed at fostering creative thinking termed creativity support systems [ 62 ] . While the use of information systems as a means for communication between group members has been a longstanding topic of investigation [ 61 ] , the emergence of intelligent systems is , though , likely to shift the role of technological artifacts in groupwork . Intelligent systems do not merely carry out tasks at the discretion of human team members but become active participants in groupwork and discussions [ 55 ] . Implications of information systems becoming more equal team members in groupwork are likely to be exacerbated in creative tasks since the emergence of ideas is known to be dependent on context , e . g . the specific path taken [ 36 ] . Untimely participation or even disturbances by the digital system may thus cause negative effects . In addition , the mechanisms underlying improvements of creative performance , especially with support Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page .

Since creative settings are known to be susceptible to interpersonal dynamics [ 31 ] and overall acceptance of artificial intelligence ( AI ) technology has been found to hinge on an appropriately human appearance and demeanor [ 51 ] , investigating the effects of intelligent systems on group processes and outcomes such as creativity seems promising . We are concerned with the facilitating aspect of intelligent systems and do not focus on the intelligence or comprehension of the system as such . Gaining a deeper understanding of creativity and its emergence has been featured in psychology research for decades [ 6 ] . Much previous research has focused on increasing the breadth and flexibility of idea search by e . g . providing stimuli on areas to explore ( e . g . [ 58 ] ) . Current work in psychology , however , proposes that not only covering a wide basis for ideas but also persistent , in - depth exploration are important for creative outcomes [ 36 ] . In conjunction with research on group facilitation , this proposition makes a number of possible interventions appear suitable to increase creative outcomes . Moreover , while facilitation by humans has been found capable of affecting creative processes , the question in how far such interventions can be carried out by information systems emerges when considering advances in intelligent systems . Against this backdrop , we pose the following research question : How do digital systems support flexibility , persistence , and thus creativity in innovation teams ? The current paper is a first step to answering this question . By drawing on extant literature in psychology and information systems , we develop hypotheses on the effects of facilitative interventions concerning the structure of and cognitive stimulation in an idea generation task . Interventions are targeted at either more breadth or more depth in exploration . In addition , drawing on extant knowledge in information systems , we hypothesize differences between facilitation conducted by a human versus a digital assistant . We test the hypotheses in an explorative lab experiment with 24 participants . The remainder of the paper is structured as follows : First , we provide theoretical background information on creative teamwork and facilitation using information systems . Drawing on this basis , we develop the research model and hypotheses regarding facilitation of breadth and depth of idea generation . In the following , we present the method used before providing and discussing results . We end the paper in describing limitations and providing concluding remarks . 2 . THEORETICAL BACKGROUND We will briefly introduce extant knowledge on creative teamwork and facilitating group creativity using information systems . 2 . 1 Creative Teamwork The organization of work in groups and especially teams is a widespread practice in today’s companies and institutions [ 16 ] , especially when the task to be accomplished is complex and requires creativity [ 31 ] . Creativity can be seen as a process , personal trait or product that brings previously unrelated aspects to form a novel outcome [ 4 ] . In a more operational sense , creativity has been judged based on criteria such as fluency , originality / novelty , flexibility , and persistence [ 25 , 48 ] . Seeking to understand how creative outcomes emerge , personality traits and cognitive abilities [ 5 ] have been assessed before environmental and social factors have been added to a componential model of creativity [ 4 ] . Research in cognitive psychology concerning this area has evolved in three stages [ 58 ] : Reasons for the comparatively lower performance of groups in brainstorming have been investigated before cognitive underpinnings of these effects became the focus , which were followed by a shift to measuring the quality in addition to the quantity of ideas . As a representative of more nuanced evaluation of creativity , the dual pathway to creativity model proposes that both persistence and flexibility in the idea generation process can improve creative outcomes [ 23 ] . An overview of the model is shown in figure 1 . Persistence describes the depth of exploration , i . e . to what extent a specific category is considered , whereas flexibility signifies the breadth of exploration , i . e . how many different categories are considered [ 36 ] . Context factors such as mood states or stimulation can influence whether individuals go down either path in creative tasks [ 1 , 23 , 36 ] . In group settings , it is to be expected that encouraging participants to be more persistent by taking more time for idea generation may compensate for the observed relatively lower performance of groups compared to individuals [ 39 ] . Figure 1 Dual Pathway to Creativity Model , based on [ 23 ] Based on the findings of how groups work together , different approaches to facilitating group processes and outcomes such as creativity have been put forth . Providing structure regarding the process [ 59 ] or the task [ 9 ] is meant to encourage productive and inhibit unproductive behaviors [ 10 ] . Such interventions have been shown to increase the rate of idea generation [ 18 ] as well as their quantity and quality [ 1 ] . Whereas structural cues can be considered boundary conditions , cognitive stimulation is a content - related means enhancing creativity by leading individuals to consider a larger knowledgebase [ 50 ] . Session : Identity SIGMIS - CPR ' 19 , June 20 – 22 , 2019 , Nashville , TN , USA 95 2 . 2 Facilitation Using IS Artifacts Information systems specifically aimed at supporting creative work have been classified as creativity support systems [ 1 ] and group creativity support systems when applied to group settings [ 60 ] . While these systems are meant to foster creative performance , their use also can impose additional cognitive load , which needs to be ameliorated by e . g . structural facilitation [ 12 ] . Such tools can support the entire lifespan concerning idea generation from generating ideas to converging on promising candidates [ 19 , 34 ] . Examples thus range from communication channels for electronic brainstorming [ 41 ] , software to facilitate idea generation [ 35 ] , to evaluation and decision support systems [ 19 ] . Interventions using digital artifacts rely on the previously identified concepts for facilitation such as structural support and cognitive stimulation . Structural interventions in the context of information systems can focus on both content , i . e . the process [ 59 ] and task [ 9 , 19 ] , or the use of technology as such [ 20 ] . Providing structure has been found to improve a number of outcomes such as the rate of idea generation [ 18 ] or uniqueness [ 56 ] , whereas aiding in decision - making is reported to increase decision quality without changing the number of ideas [ 19 ] . Providing stimuli has been found to influence idea generation by e . g . sustaining or changing the category considered [ 53 ] , leading to more in - depth exploration [ 1 ] , or to boost creative output of less creative people [ 2 ] . Similar effects have been found for the subtler form of priming , in which stimulation may not be as salient , by e . g . using a video game setting to alter idea generation [ 8 ] . 3 . RESEARCH MODEL Drawing on extant knowledge , we develop a general overview of the facilitative effects of structure and cognitive stimulation , which leads to hypotheses concerning the two pathways to creativity shown in figure 2 . Additionally , we develop hypotheses on the differences between human and digital facilitation concerning performance , satisfaction , and perceived helpfulness . As highlighted before , providing structure in creative processes has been found to positively influence outcomes . Concerning the observed inferior performance of groups in brainstorming [ 58 ] , it has been put forth that the interference effects of within - team communication keep teams from working systematically [ 22 ] , likely because structure determines the ( mis ) allocation of attention [ 43 ] . Moreover , how a group structures its work can lead to negative effects such as production blocking but also contribute to positive group performance [ 37 ] . Adequate structural facilitation has moreover been found to foster more in - depth exploration of categories [ 15 ] and increased rates of idea generation [ 18 ] . Examples of structural interventions include time - constraints [ 18 ] , directed brainstorming [ 52 ] , and guiding the process [ 1 ] . Another key means to facilitating group creativity lies in cognitive stimulation . Providing stimuli is described to lead individuals to explore larger parts of their knowledge [ 50 ] . In addition , the type of knowledge that is salient can be increased and adjusted to the situation at hand [ 38 ] . When the stimuli provided are in line with the category currently under consideration , ideation tends to stay within the bounds of this category . On the other hand , when stimuli refer to a different category , ideation follows suit [ 53 ] . Another difference in stimulation lies in its salience , which can range from the explicit introduction of stimuli to less salient priming , which can still increase individual cognition [ 7 ] . Considering the extant knowledge presented above , we expect a combination of interventions based on structure and cognitive stimulation to foster flexibility in group ideation . To this extent , structural interventions that push for more divergence seem promising . Examples include structures to keep group attention on the ideas of others [ 24 ] . In addition , cognitive stimulation with many diverse , categories is expected to lead to e . g . more original ideas [ 15 , 33 , 38 ] . Combining these effects , we put forth : H1 : Providing appropriate structure and cognitive stimulation triggers groups to ideate on the flexibility pathway . Analogously to flexibility , it seems likely a combination of structural interventions and stimulation can enhance persistence in group idea generation . Providing structure can lead groups to more fully explore given categories [ 15 ] , which links to the prescribed more systematic approach in the persistence pathway [ 36 ] . An example lies in curtailing the area of exploration to defined subcategories [ 49 ] . In addition , ideation outcomes can be improved for a given topic by activating knowledge closely related to the category under investigation through e . g . asking leading questions [ 50 ] . Combining these facilitation effects , we put forth : H2 : Providing appropriate structure and cognitive stimulation triggers groups to ideate on the persistence pathway . While the preceding arguments for positive facilitation have been independent of whether facilitation is provided by human or digital actors , a key interest of this research is digital facilitation . A digital facilitator capable of providing the interventions described previously is likely to take a special spot in the team based on the combination of roles as structural facilitator and cognitive stimulator with high or low salience . These combined roles arguably make the digital facilitator more like its human counterpart . Such an increase in humanness is expected to increase trust and thus acceptance [ 51 ] – eventually it may even make it appear to be a teammate [ 55 ] . This expectation coincides , however , with the assertion that the role of digital artifacts in group settings is hardly understood [ 29 , 55 ] . The above argument can , however , be evaluated by drawing on research concerning Figure 2 Overview of Research Model Session : Identity SIGMIS - CPR ' 19 , June 20 – 22 , 2019 , Nashville , TN , USA 96 chatbots . On the one hand , dialogs with chatbots tend to be of lower quality than with humans [ 26 ] , which may reduce especially stimulation effects of facilitation . Digital facilitators may also draw attention away from the task and interrupt group interactions with bad timing , which may reduce team performance [ 44 ] . On the other hand , the facilitative features are limited to those deemed helpful , which may reduce nonproductive interruptions , and may make interruptions seem as purely informative breaks . Intelligent systems have been found to perform as well as human counterparts , especially in giving advice [ 51 ] . In addition , the digital facilitator may be seen as a neutral expert [ 30 ] , which may make it more trustworthy . Balancing the expectation of humanness and explicitly helpful cues on the one hand and the less natural dialogs on the other , we posit : H3 : There is no difference in the effects of facilitation between human and digital facilitators . Beyond the more objective criterion of outcomes , it is worthwhile to consider perceptions of group members regarding the quality of facilitation . As a pars pro toto of perceptions , we consider the satisfaction of participants as an important basis for future adoption [ 11 , 56 ] . Satisfaction is assessed concerning both the process and outcomes , i . e . ideas , to capture perceptions of net goal attainment [ 47 ] . Since we expect no differences in outcomes for digital facilitation , we put forth : H4a : There is no differences in satisfaction with ideas between digital and human facilitation . Since interacting with a digital facilitator may be more cumbersome and not fully attain the same level of humanness , see H3 , we expect differences in process satisfaction . Moreover , the lower quality interactions may cause irritations , annoy participants and thus reduce perceptions of helpfulness . We thus posit : H4b : Process satisfaction will be lower for digital versus human facilitation . H4c : Perceived helpfulness will be lower for digital versus human facilitation . 4 . METHOD 4 . 1 Intervention Design In order to test the effects of facilitation , we derived interventions for improved creativity in general as well as specifically for enabling flexibility and persistence . These interventions are equally meant for human and digital facilitation . Providing instructions is known to positively affect idea generation in brainstorming [ 42 ] . For example , the type of instructions provided affects output quantity [ 14 ] , which moreover correlates with quality [ 57 ] . In addition , rules such as giving time for individual brainstorming without group interaction can alleviate issues of production blocking [ 24 ] . Based on these findings , the following interventions were used for all sessions : G1 : The facilitator encourages teams to go for quantity . G2 : The facilitator provides teams with general rules for brainstorming . G3 : Teams get time for individual brainstorming to minimize effects of production blocking . Both structure and cognitive simulation are expected to help with achieving flexibility in ideation . To achieve attention to ideas of others , which leads to more useful ideas [ 32 ] , a structural cue is implemented in F1 . The procedural structure is supported by using a stakeholder map [ 13 ] providing an overview of categories and their relations . In addition , cognitive stimulation is used to achieve more creative outcomes . This leads to the following two interventions : F1 : The facilitator gives instructions to brainstorm for categories first , in order to cover more categories than in conventional brainstorming , which should inspire the next brainstorming on the task itself as more categories are salient . F2 : The facilitator provides external stimuli in the form of new ( and not yet mentioned ) categories and analogies . Analogously , to induce persistence , structural facilitation aims at limiting the search scope to a small segment , which should be explored in - depth . Brainwriting increases exposure to the ideas of others further by having participants write down ideas and passing them on to others for continued elaboration , which has been found to increase unique ideas [ 24 ] . As cognitive stimulation , priming participants with leading questions has been proposed to increase productivity within the category [ 50 ] . We thus use the following strategies for facilitation : P1 : The facilitator asks questions to activate knowledge prior to brainstorming ( priming ) . P2 : The facilitator suggests groups to perform brainwriting to motivate group members to pay close attention to and build upon others’ ideas . 4 . 2 Implementation Drawing on the dual pathway to creativity model [ 36 ] , we operationalize the outcomes of facilitation concerning the two dimensions process and characteristics of ideas generated . Ideas are evaluated based on novelty , usefulness , and overall creativity [ 1 , 3 ] . The process is assessed based on fluency , i . e . number of ideas generated , [ 48 ] , breadth ( flexibility ) and depth ( persistence ) [ 23 , 36 ] . To allow for assessing process variables , ideas are categorized based on goals and means [ 22 ] , which allows for counting the number of categories as breadth of exploration . Depth of exploration is taken as fluency divided by breadth . Satisfaction is assessed using a slightly adapted version of the scale by Reinig [ 47 ] , whereas for perceived helpfulness three items have been developed covering ease of use , helpfulness , and distraction . As controls , familiarity of group members , diversity , and averages of openness to experience [ 28 ] , creative thinking Session : Identity SIGMIS - CPR ' 19 , June 20 – 22 , 2019 , Nashville , TN , USA 97 capability [ 54 ] , and intrinsic motivation [ 17 ] have been included . All items were implemented with 7 - point Likert scales . We conducted eight sessions in laboratory settings with three participants each , mostly with a university background . Each session lasted for about 60 minutes and covered the two previously covered topics “how to retain health” [ 40 ] and “how to improve university” [ 32 ] . Before and after each of the two brainstorming tasks , forms were administered to collect survey responses . The lab study was set - up as a 2x2 design . Digital versus human facilitation was altered between subjects , whereas flexibility and persistence were surveyed within subjects . All sessions were divided into four segments : An introduction to the task and use of the general facilitation strategies G1 and G2 are followed by F1 or P1 , depending on the treatment . For all treatments , participants get time for silent brainstorming before being exposed to strategy F2 or P2 , which leads to the final documentation phase . Digital facilitation was implemented as a prototype of a digital voice assistant built on the Google DialogFlow programming system . Whereas the human facilitator intervened between the respective sections , the digital facilitator had to be woken up by the team to provide its input . Analogously to a menu selection it would ask for the current stage of the group to provide the appropriate instructions . More information on the digital assistant can be obtained from the authors . Using the process by Diehl [ 22 ] , one of the authors coded the ideas generated by the groups regarding goals and means . The results were rated on novelty , usefulness , and overall creativity by three Design Thinking coaches , including another author . The scale midpoint was taken to classify ideas as high or low [ 50 ] . This data was analyzed in conjunction with the survey data . Correlations and hierarchical regressions concerning control variables , facilitation treatment , and facilitation medium were conducted using R and additional libraries . 5 . RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Most of the hypotheses concerning ( digital ) facilitation were supported . While the standard threshold of agreement between raters has not been attained [ 21 ] and all ratings are relatively high , Table 1 Correlations of Process and Outcomes Variables M ( SD ) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Outcome variables ( # of ideas ) 1 ) Novel 10 . 88 7 . 97 - 2 ) Useful 15 . 88 4 . 65 0 . 76 * * * ( . 0007 ) - 3 ) Creative 12 . 63 7 . 89 0 . 97 * * * ( . 0000 ) 0 . 78 * * * ( . 0004 ) - Process variables 4 ) Fluency 30 . 06 8 . 05 0 . 83 * * * ( . 0001 ) 0 . 74 * * ( . 0010 ) 0 . 78 * * * ( . 0004 ) - 5 ) Flexibility 18 . 88 5 . 46 0 . 75 * * * ( . 0009 ) 0 . 63 * * ( . 0093 ) 0 . 74 * * ( . 0011 ) 0 . 79 * * * ( . 0003 ) - 6 ) Persistence 1 . 63 0 . 34 0 . 10 ( . 7211 ) 0 . 16 ( . 5638 ) 0 . 02 ( . 9311 ) 0 . 27 ( . 3077 ) - 0 . 36 ( . 1719 ) - Group differences ( controls ) 7 ) Familliarity 2 . 81 1 . 11 - 0 . 52 * ( . 0410 ) - 0 . 45† ( . 0781 ) - 0 . 44† ( . 0852 ) - 0 . 51 * ( . 0427 ) - 0 . 35 ( . 1786 ) - 0 . 30 ( . 2547 ) - 8 ) Avg openness to experience 4 . 92 0 . 62 0 . 60 * ( . 0149 ) 0 . 69 * * ( . 0029 ) 0 . 61 * ( . 0129 ) 0 . 56 * ( . 0239 ) 0 . 39 ( . 1323 ) 0 . 24 ( . 3789 ) - 0 . 31 ( . 2390 ) - 9 ) Avg creative thinking capability 6 . 13 1 . 83 0 . 51 * ( . 0441 ) 0 . 61 * ( . 0114 ) 0 . 49† ( . 0540 ) 0 . 68 * * ( . 0040 ) 0 . 50† ( . 0511 ) 0 . 29 ( . 2813 ) - 0 . 56 * ( . 0251 ) 0 . 81 * * * ( . 0001 ) - 10 ) Diversity 8 . 72 5 . 06 - 0 . 24 ( . 3627 ) 0 . 01 ( . 9750 ) - 0 . 20 ( . 4464 ) - 0 . 07 ( . 8054 ) - 0 . 06 ( . 8281 ) 0 . 05 ( . 8510 ) - 0 . 06 ( . 8326 ) 0 . 41 ( . 1161 ) 0 . 56 * ( . 0245 ) - Treatments 11 ) Flexibility / persistence 0 . 24 ( . 3643 ) - 0 . 06 ( . 8380 ) 0 . 26 ( . 3273 ) - 0 . 02 ( . 9296 ) 0 . 47† ( . 0645 ) - 0 . 74 * * ( . 0011 ) 0 ( 1 ) 0 ( 1 ) 0 ( 1 ) 0 ( 1 ) 12 ) Digital / physical - 0 . 24 ( . 3643 ) - 0 . 14 ( . 6078 ) - 0 . 08 ( . 7633 ) - 0 . 06 ( . 8365 ) 0 . 07 ( . 7942 ) - 0 . 30 ( . 2660 ) 0 . 41 ( . 1177 ) - 0 . 02 ( . 9392 ) - 0 . 02 ( . 9311 ) 0 . 21 ( . 4243 ) 13 ) University vs . health topic - 0 . 05 ( . 8581 ) - 0 . 03 ( . 9186 ) 0 . 10 ( . 7176 ) - 0 . 07 ( . 7906 ) - 0 . 14 ( . 6004 ) 0 . 10 ( . 7128 ) 0 ( 1 ) 0 ( 1 ) 0 ( 1 ) 0 ( 1 ) N = 16 . †p < 0 . 1 , * p < 0 . 05 , * * p < 0 . 01 , * * * p < 0 . 001 ; two - tailed p - values ; dummies : flexibility = 1 , digital = 1 . Session : Identity SIGMIS - CPR ' 19 , June 20 – 22 , 2019 , Nashville , TN , USA 98 this can be explained by the open ideation task that per se should foster creative outcomes . As hypothesized , the facilitation strategies show the expected positive relations with the respective process measures . The flexibility treatment is positively correlated with the flexibility process variable , which is mirrored in the regression models . Analogous results are discernable for the persistence treatment . This supports H1 and H2 . Concerning the differences between digital and human facilitation , we obtained mixed results . In terms of objective performance differences , correlations show a negative , albeit insignificant , tendency of digital facilitation , whereas regressions show mixed yet insignificant results . This leads us to tentatively support H3 . Concerning the subjectively perceived differences , we observe a highly significant negative correlation with perceived helpfulness , supporting H4c , and insignificant effects on idea and process satisfaction , which tentatively supports H4a . H4b is rejected since the negative relation with process satisfaction is quite insignificant . Beyond descriptive analyses , we discuss implications of results for information systems design and analysis in group contexts and related potentials for future research . Our results indicate that interventions to invoke the specific pathways to creativity also work when administered by a digital facilitator . This result is all the more noteworthy considering the prototype status of the assistant , which required for example manual activation after each segment . These results could , however , be due to a lack of overall helpfulness of facilitation . While we do not deem this option likely , it could have been that groups perform just as well without any facilitation . To rule out this option , it may be worthwhile to add a control group with no facilitation at all . Results add to extant findings on the facilitative capabilities of information systems for creativity [ 62 ] and the effects of using intelligent systems in group settings . In this context , the marked difference between objective and subjective results is worth considering . The more objective results of only insignificant differences between human and digital facilitation in terms of process and outcome variables may imply that even in the challenging context of creative tasks , digital facilitation is nearly on par with human counterparts , mirroring findings of good task - based outcomes of intelligent systems [ 51 ] . This could be due to the relatively stark emphasis on structural facilitation , which has been shown to work well in settings with digital facilitators [ 18 ] . Given the similarity of the voice assistant to a chatbot , this result is also in line with findings that human language use can be transferred to intelligent systems [ 26 ] . It should , however , be noted that the assessment criteria and procedure may have failed to capture existing differences in outcomes . Considering more subjective outcomes related to participant perceptions , the highly significant difference in perceived helpfulness stands out . This difference in perceptions is curious when interpreted in light of the proposed relations between intelligent system characteristics and the work setting . It has been proposed that these attributes interact to change team outcomes and process variables such as affective and cognitive concepts [ 63 ] . Given the relatively short duration of the sessions , it may be the case that time was not sufficient for adverse effects on objective outcomes . An interesting interpretation arises from the joint consideration of the relations of digital facilitation with persistence and perceived helpfulness : Both are negative compared to the human counterpart , albeit significantly only for the subjectively perceived helpfulness . This perception may , however , have caused participants to be less persistent in exploration , which would constitute an indirect negative objective effect of digital facilitation . It thus seems worthwhile to investigate digital facilitation over extended periods of time and to seek out why perceived helpfulness is markedly lower . A possible explanation lies in the interaction with the digital system . The assistant had to be woken up for each interaction and told which phase users were in . Given this arguably low quality in interaction [ 26 ] , it may be the case that the digital facilitator missed a markedly human touch , which has been found to be a main determinant of adopting intelligent systems [ 51 ] . It thus seems we are not ( yet ) on the brink of humans being readily replaced by voice assistants . These observations also relate to the question how future collaboration between humans and intelligent systems will be Table 2 Correlations of Treatment and Subjective Perceptions M ( SD ) 1 2 3 4 Idea and process satisfaction ( Avg ) 1 ) Intrinsic motivation 5 . 94 0 . 65 - 2 ) Perceived helpfulness of assistant 4 . 75 0 . 97 0 . 28 ( . 2904 ) - 3 ) Satisfaction with ideas 5 . 38 0 . 55 0 . 80 * * * ( . 0002 ) 0 . 09 ( . 7310 ) - 4 ) Satisfaction with process 5 . 67 0 . 73 0 . 93 * * * ( . 0000 ) 0 . 40 ( . 1261 ) 0 . 85 * * * ( . 0000 ) - Treatment 5 ) Digital vs . physical facilitation - 0 . 17 ( . 5398 ) - 0 . 82 * * * ( . 0001 ) 0 . 08 ( . 7714 ) - 0 . 30 ( . 2511 ) N = 16 . †p < 0 . 1 , * p < 0 . 05 , * * p < 0 . 01 , * * * p < 0 . 001 ; dummy : digital = 1 . Session : Identity SIGMIS - CPR ' 19 , June 20 – 22 , 2019 , Nashville , TN , USA 99 designed . With intelligent systems effectively becoming team members , the interesting question how work will be divided arises : Who will be in a position of authority ? How are group processes and outcomes affected ? Drawing on known effects of authority distribution on cooperation between humans and intelligent systems [ 27 ] , it is an interesting note that the digital system in this study was a facilitator giving instructions , attributing it relatively high authority . Since the digital facilitator was meant to have a natural , human - like appearance , participants may have let it gain control of their work [ 27 ] . This explanation is to some extent backed by the insignificant effects regarding satisfaction with ideas and the process . Participants may have perceived the interaction as not helpful , yet considering the annoyance in communication , were relatively satisfied with the process and their outcomes . To test this proposition , it would be necessary to test the effects of digital and human facilitation in a within - subjects design . Moreover , our results based on the dual pathway model imply that future designs of information systems should consider known nuances in group processes . Since facilitating the respective pathway is likely feasible , systems that aim at improving creativity may achieve superior performance if more targeted approaches are used . Intertwined with decisions concerning the design of collaboration is the issue of a lack of knowledge on how technology artifacts and their design influence group interactions [ 1 ] . Changes in the design and characteristics of intelligent systems have been proposed to interact with task and human characteristics to influence both objective and subjective group processes and lastly outputs [ 63 ] . Additionally , more far - reaching issues may arise such as boundaries to developing relations with intelligent systems or possible political implications [ 55 ] . Judging from these issues , the already challenging task of determining antecedents and drivers of group performance is set to become markedly more complex by the involvement of intelligent systems . While these systems become more intelligent , their reactions still are not equal to humans and thus may make approaches of human groupwork not directly applicable to human / system workgroups . Research on the effects of information systems in groupwork may benefit from evolving from treating technology artifacts as objects with set purposes to Table 3 Results of Hierarchical Regression Explanatory variables Process variables Outcome variables ( # of ideas ) Flexibility Persistence Fluency novel useful creative Intercept 11 . 51 ( 12 . 97 ) 1 . 42 ( 1 . 0 ) 12 . 68 ( 12 . 64 ) - 17 . 96 ( 12 . 54 ) - 4 . 91 ( 8 . 88 ) - 20 . 86 ( 14 . 01 ) 1 - Group differences Familliarity 0 . 56 ( 1 . 61 ) - 0 . 06 ( . 12 ) 0 . 52 ( 1 . 57 ) - 1 . 45 ( 1 . 56 ) - 0 . 54 ( 1 . 10 ) - 1 . 03 ( 1 . 74 ) Avg openness to experience - 1 . 28 ( 3 . 82 ) 0 . 04 ( . 29 ) - 1 . 12 ( 3 . 71 ) 6 . 79 ( 3 . 69 ) † 4 . 25 ( 2 . 61 ) 7 . 47 ( 4 . 12 ) † Divergent thinking cap . 2 . 92 ( 1 . 75 ) 0 . 03 ( . 13 ) 5 . 13 * ( 1 . 71 ) 1 . 45 ( 1 . 69 ) 0 . 77 ( 1 . 20 ) 1 . 16 ( 1 . 89 ) Diversity - 0 . 58 ( . 34 ) - 0 . 01 ( . 03 ) - 1 . 08 ( . 33 ) * * - 1 . 04 ( . 01 ) * - 0 . 37 ( . 23 ) - 0 . 94 ( . 03 ) * Topic - 1 . 50 ( 2 . 51 ) 0 . 065 ( . 19 ) - 1 . 13 ( 2 . 44 ) - 0 . 75 ( 2 . 42 ) - 0 . 25 ( 1 . 71 ) 1 . 50 ( . 59 ) R2 0 . 44 0 . 13 0 . 75 0 . 75 0 . 64 0 . 69 F ( 5 . 10 ) 1 . 57 0 . 3 6 . 15 * * 6 . 10 * * 3 . 51 * 4 . 37 * 2 - Pathway Flexibility / persistence treatment 5 . 0 ( 2 . 05 ) * - 0 . 48 ( . 12 ) * * - 0 . 38 ( 2 . 57 ) 3 . 75 ( 2 . 23 ) - 0 . 5 ( 1 . 80 ) 4 . 0 ( 2 . 52 ) R2 0 . 66 0 . 67 0 . 76 0 . 81 0 . 64 0 . 75 F ( 6 . 9 ) 2 . 94† 3 . 06† 4 . 63† 6 . 49 * * 2 . 66† 4 . 62 * ∆ F 5 . 89 * 15 . 56 * * 0 . 02 2 . 52 0 . 07 2 . 45 3 - Facilitation Digital / physical facilitation 2 . 27 ( 2 . 38 ) - 0 . 17 ( . 14 ) 1 . 80 ( 3 . 09 ) - 0 . 01 ( 1 . 0 ) 0 . 23 ( 2 . 21 ) 2 . 56 ( 2 . 96 ) R2 0 . 70 0 . 72 0 . 77 0 . 81 0 . 64 0 . 78 F ( 7 . 8 ) 2 . 63† 2 . 96† 3 . 73† 4 . 95 * 2 . 03 3 . 96 * ∆ F 0 . 91 1 . 45 0 . 34 0 . 00 0 . 01 0 . 75 N = 16 . †p < 0 . 1 , * p < 0 . 05 , * * p < 0 . 01 , * * * p < 0 . 001 ; two - tailed p - values ; dummies : flexibility = 1 . digital = 1 .

Considering the gravity of these issues and their intertwined nature , a co - evolution of designing systems and learning about their effects on teamwork seems promising . 6 . LIMITATIONS Also given our intention of initial exploration of digital facilitation , the current study has several limitations . We have only included a relatively small number of participants with a relatively homogeneous university background . In addition , the brainstorming task and chosen topics may have skewed results since the need for facilitation may have been perceived as too low . As a methodical observation , the agreement between raters on the characteristics of ideas was not as recommended in literature , which may limit the interpretation of results concerning the ideas themselves . Moreover , validation of the scales used to measure the underlying constructs would help draw more substantiated conclusions . In addition , our analysis of the effects of facilitation on process variables and outcomes is limited . A more comprehensive analysis of mediation effects may generate additional and more reliable insights . Moreover , the digital facilitator was only a prototype built on the Google DialogFlow system , which imposed constraints in terms of direct usability . 7 . CONCLUSION Information systems have proliferated in the workplace to support now virtually any activity , including creative groupwork . Given the nascence of intelligent systems , which go beyond “passive” information systems and may be perceived closer to humans , we investigated the question how well a digital facilitator is able to help in conducting a group idea generation task . We drew on the dual pathway to creativity model and extant knowledge on ( digital ) facilitation to derive a set of facilitative interventions , which have been implemented in a digital voice assistant . Hypotheses state that facilitative action concerning structure and cognitive stimulation is able to foster persistence or flexibility , respectively , in idea generation . Moreover , we expected the digital facilitator to perform equally to its human counterpart on objective measures but to show deficiencies in subjective evaluations . The performance of the digital facilitator has been tested in a 2x2 lab experiment with 24 participants . Results mostly support hypotheses with facilitation successfully influencing idea generation processes . The digital facilitator did not perform significantly differently compared to the human one considering objective criteria and satisfaction . It did , however , significantly fall behind in terms of perceived helpfulness . Our results add to the currently vibrant discussion on researching collaboration between humans and intelligent systems .
