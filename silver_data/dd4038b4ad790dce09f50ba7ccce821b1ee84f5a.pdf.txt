Three key actin binding proteins - profilin , cofilin and twinfilin individually depolymerize filament barbed ends . Notwithstanding recent leaps in our understanding of their individual action , how they collectively regulate filament dynamics remains an open question . In absence of direct and simultaneous visualization of these proteins at barbed ends , gaining mechanistic insights has been challenging . We have here investigated multicomponent dynamics of profilin , cofilin and twinfilin using a hybrid approach that combines high throughput single filament experiments with theory . We discovered that while twinfilin competes with profilin , it promotes binding of cofilin to filament sides . Interestingly , contrary to previous expectations , we found that profilin and cofilin can simultaneously bind the same filament barbed end resulting in its accelerated depolymerization . Our study reveals that pair - wise interactions can effectively capture depolymerization dynamics in simultaneous presence of all three proteins . We thus believe that our approach of employing a theory - experiment dialog can potentially help decipher multicomponent regulation of actin dynamics . 3 Main Text Introduction Cells regulate assembly and remodeling of their actin cytoskeleton in response to mechanochemical signals ( 1 - 3 ) . This response is mediated via the action of a large battery of proteins that combinatorially regulate dynamics of intracellular actin networks . Majority of these interactions take place at one of the two extremities of the actin filament , namely the barbed and the pointed end ( 1 , 4 ) . Decades of genetic experiments have identified key molecular components required for actin dynamics in vivo . Subsequent biochemical studies using purified proteins have since revealed how many of these components individually affect actin dynamics in vitro . Nonetheless , how cells integrate activities of these proteins to regulate actin assembly and disassembly of remains poorly understood . There are three dominant approaches for deciphering multicomponent regulation of actin dynamics . Classically , the bulk pyrene fluorescence assay has been the technique of choice for investigating actin dynamics ( 5 ) . While changes in pyrene signal readily allows measurement of effects of various actin binding proteins , this approach is difficult to employ for proteins which alter properties of the pyrene dye . For instance , cofilin binding to pyrene labelled F - actin causes quenching of the dye ( 6 ) . The second approach involves direct visualization of fluorescently labelled protein molecules interacting with actin filaments using multicolor single - molecule microscopy . This technique has led to major discoveries such as mechanism of filament branching ( 7 , 8 ) , collaborative actin assembly by adenomatous polyposis coli ( APC ) and Spire ( 9 ) , simultaneous association of elongators , blockers and depolymerases with actin filament barbed end ( 10 - 12 ) , and synergistic depolymerization of pointed ends by cofilin and cyclase associated protein etc . ( 13 , 14 ) . Despite the great promise of this approach , labelling proteins without altering their activities and simultaneously visualizing multiple proteins is technically challenging and difficult to scale up . Further , this approach is difficult to employ for transient associations ( < < 1 s ) . The third approach is to leverage insights from structural studies of individual proteins bound to actin monomers ( i . e . , co - crystals ) to predict how multiple proteins might simultaneously bind filaments and influence filament dynamics ( 10 , 15 , 16 ) . However , since most of these co - crystal structures are for proteins bound to G - actin , majority of inferences are gained by docking structures of proteins bound to actin monomers on cryo - EM structures of actin filaments ( 10 , 16 ) . More recently , cryo - EM studies have allowed direct imaging of proteins bound to actin filament ends ( 17 , 18 ) . 4 Nevertheless , this approach has so far only been successful for individual proteins bound to filament ends with a very high affinity . As a result , these structure - based methods only provide a static picture taking into account only the long - lived binding configurations . Consequently , it has so far not been possible to employ this approach to investigate the effects of short - lived transient multiprotein complexes . Here we present an alternative strategy of combining high - throughput experimental measurements with theory to study multicomponent regulation of actin dynamics without the need to directly visualize the individual proteins . Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy ( TIRF ) has been the technique of choice for visualizing dynamics of individual actin filaments for over two decades ( 19 , 20 ) . More recently , combining microfluidics and TIRF has enabled rapid and precise measurement of actin filament end dynamics across hundreds of filaments ( 10 , 13 , 14 , 21 - 29 ) . Such high throughput quantitative measurements are amenable to theoretical modeling . To this end , falsifiable models predicated upon distinct mechanisms , which make specific predictions , can be built , and the corresponding predictions can be tested experimentally . To test the applicability of our theory - experiment approach , we asked how three key actin binding proteins - profilin , twinfilin and cofilin - together cause barbed - end depolymerization of actin filaments . Our results provide insights on whether these three proteins compete or cooperate at barbed ends to regulate filament depolymerization . All three of these proteins can bind filamentous and monomeric actin . Their specific affinities and effects on barbed - end dynamics however are highly sensitive to the nucleotide state of actin ( 1 , 3 ) . Profilin preferentially binds ATP - G - actin subunits to inhibit filament nucleation , prevents monomer association at filament pointed ends ( 30 - 33 ) , and supports processive elongation by delivering monomers to proline - rich proteins ( formins , Ena / VASP ( vasodilator - stimulated phosphoprotein ) etc . ) ( 34 - 36 ) . Cofilin and twinfilin , which are both members of the ADF / Cofilin family of proteins , on the other hand bind aged - ADP - actin monomers much more strongly than ATP - actin monomers ( 6 , 37 - 39 ) . More recently , each of these proteins has been shown to bind filament barbed ends and accelerate depolymerization of newly - assembled ADP - P i actin filaments ( 16 , 21 , 23 , 28 ) . Nevertheless , how these three proteins influence barbed - end depolymerization when simultaneously present has never been addressed . We therefore applied our theory - experiment approach to investigate their combined interactions at ADP - P i filament barbed ends . We have here elected to investigate the effects of these proteins on ADP - Pi rather than ADP - actin barbed ends to avoid complications due to cofilin’s rapid severing of ADP - actin filaments . 5 To gain mechanistic insights on multiprotein regulation of actin depolymerization by these three proteins , we first considered two broad classes of mechanisms via which any two simultaneously present depolymerases can interact with filament barbed ends . In the first mechanism , the two proteins compete at barbed ends , resulting in their mutually exclusive binding where only one of them is bound ( and depolymerizing barbed ends ) at a given time . In the second mechanism , the two proteins simultaneously bind to the same barbed end leading to increased rates of depolymerization . We developed an orthogonal approach by combining high throughput experiments with theoretical modelling to distinguish between these two modes of multiprotein interactions . Using multicolor single - molecule and high throughput microfluidics - assisted TIRF imaging ( mf - TIRF ) of hundreds of actin filaments , we first carried out a careful examination of barbed end depolymerization by these depolymerases either individually or in pairs . Results from earlier studies suggest that profilin and cofilin bind actin monomers in a mutually exclusive fashion due to their targeting of the same barbed surface of G - actin ( 40 - 42 ) . However , we discovered that they are able to simultaneously associate with the same filament barbed end leading to enhanced depolymerization . Surprisingly , when actin filaments were simultaneously exposed to a solution containing cofilin and twinfilin , we found that observed depolymerization rates were consistently lower than those predicted by a model accounting for simple competition between these two proteins for barbed end binding . Our analysis suggests that presence of twinfilin at the barbed end might promote association of cofilin to filament sides . Interestingly we discovered that pair - wise interactions can successfully predict depolymerization dynamics in simultaneous presence of all three proteins . Taken together , our results provide novel insights on simultaneous interactions of profilin , cofilin and twinfilin with filament barbed ends using a promising approach combining theory and experiments . We believe this approach will have far - reaching implications for elucidating underlying principles which govern multicomponent protein dynamics across a range of biological processes . Results Quantitative characterization of effects of individual proteins on barbed end depolymerization Previous studies have characterized the effects of profilin , cofilin and twinfilin individually on barbed - end depolymerization of ADP - P i filaments ( 16 , 21 , 23 , 28 ) . To eliminate any inconsistencies due to use of different biochemical conditions and TIRF approaches amongst these studies , we first carried out a side - by - side quantitative characterization of each of these 6 proteins using microfluidics - assisted TIRF microscopy ( mf - TIRF ) ( Fig . 1a , b ) . Actin filaments were grown by exposing coverslip - anchored spectrin - actin seeds to a solution containing fluorescently - labelled actin monomers and profilin ( 22 ) ( Fig . 1d ) . These filaments were all anchored at their pointed ends and their barbed ends remained free , thus allowing unambiguous recording of barbed - end depolymerization of hundreds of filaments . Filaments were maintained in ADP - P i state throughout the experiment by supplementing the TIRF buffer with 50 mM P i ( 23 ) ( see methods ) . Using this setup , we first measured the depolymerization rate of filament barbed ends in presence of each of these depolymerases individually . Consistent with earlier studies , all three proteins increased barbed - end depolymerization of ADP - P i filaments in a concentration - dependent fashion ( Fig . 1f - h ) . 7 Fig . 1 : Cofilin , profilin and twinfilin individually accelerate depolymerization of ADP - P i actin filament barbed ends .

( c ) An example of field of view of actin filaments in mf - TIRF microscopy ( d ) Experimental strategy for measuring barbed - end depolymerization of ADP - P i filaments in presence of cofilin , profilin or twinfilin individually . Actin filaments with free barbed end were polymerized from coverslip - anchored spectrin - actin seeds by introducing 1 µM G - actin ( 15 % Alexa - 488 labeled ) and 4 µM profilin in modified TIRF buffer . These filaments were then exposed to a flow containing cofilin , twinfilin , or profilin and the rate of depolymerization at their barbed ends ( BE ) was monitored .

Experiments in ( d ) , ( e ) , and ( f ) were performed three times and yielded similar results . The data shown are from one experiment each . Here su / s refers to subunits / s . To understand this data , we developed a simple thermodynamic model of actin filament depolymerization ( Supplementary Figure 1a ) . A key assumption of this model is that the timescales associated with binding and unbinding of various depolymerases to actin barbed ends are much faster than the rate of depolymerization . Similar thermodynamic models have been earlier applied to understanding mechanism regulating transcription ( 43 , 44 ) . In this model , a single protein molecule P binds to the barbed end of a bare actin filament . As a result , the barbed can either be in a bare ( free ) state or a protein - bound state . Using statistical mechanics , we can obtain the equilibrium weights of these two states respectively ( 43 ) , which are dictated by the protein’s dissociation constant ( K D , P ) and its concentration ( C P ) in the solution . Rates of depolymerization in each of these states are given by d 0 and d 1 respectively . The average depolymerization rate ( D P ) of a filament can then be written as 8 0 0 1 1 , P D d p d p = + ( 1 ) where p 0 is the probability of the filament end being in the bare state and p 1 is the probability of the filament end being in protein - bound state ( see SI for details ) . After a bit of algebra , the depolymerization rate can be rewritten as 0 , 1 , . D P P P P D P d K d C D C K + = + ( 2 ) We use Equation 2 to compare our model to experimental data . Our model fits the experimental data well ( Fig . 1f - h ) and allows extraction of depolymerization rates in the bare state ( d 0 ) , protein bound state ( d 1 ) , and dissociation constant ( K D , P ) for each of these proteins separately ( see Table 1 below for fitted parameters ) . The rate of depolymerization from the bare barbed end is given by d 0 = 0 . 50 ± 0 . 08 su / s , as extracted from experimental data . As expected from our model , the experimentally observed depolymerization rates increased with the bulk concentration and eventually saturated . At saturating concentration , the barbed end is almost always occupied by a protein molecule . The quantitative characterization carried out in this section paves the way for studying the combined effects of multiple proteins on barbed - end depolymerization .

Uncovering multi - protein barbed - end depolymerization using competitive and simultaneous binding models We have thus far quantified the effects of individual proteins . In living cells however , multiple proteins simultaneously regulate actin dynamics . Proteins targeting the same site on a filament 9 can either bind competitively ( i . e . , mutually exclusively ) or simultaneously . We developed two broad classes of thermodynamic models to discriminate between these two possible modes of interaction i . e . , competitive or simultaneous binding . In the competitive binding model , two proteins bind the barbed end in a mutually exclusive manner , whereby only one of them occupies the barbed end at a given moment . In contrast , in the simultaneous binding model , two proteins can simultaneously occupy the same barbed end . Below , we discuss the two models in greater detail . When two proteins A and B bind the barbed end competitively ( following the competitive binding model ) , the barbed end can exist in three different states – free , protein A bound , or protein B bound as shown in Fig . 2a . The statistical weights of these different states in equilibrium are governed by the dissociation constants of the two proteins and their concentrations respectively ( 43 ) . Each of these three states is characterized by its distinct depolymerization rate – d 0 ( free ) , d 1 , A ( protein A bound ) and d 1 , B ( protein B bound ) . Switching between these states results in an average depolymerization rate given by 0 , , 1 , , 1 , , , , , , , D A D B A A D B B B D A AB D A D B A D B B D A d K K d C K d C K D K K C K C K + + = + + ( 3 ) where C A and C B are concentrations of the two proteins , and K D , A / B is the dissociation constant of protein A or B at the barbed end ( see SI for details ) . The competitive binding model exhibits a complex concentration - dependent behavior as shown in Fig . 2c . At low concentrations , the average depolymerization rate in simultaneous presence of both the proteins is higher than when either of the proteins is present alone . In contrast , at higher concentrations the average depolymerization rate with two proteins present lies somewhere in between the depolymerization rates of individual proteins . 10 Fig . 2 : ( a ) Thermodynamic model for competitive interaction of two proteins at the barbed end . At equilibrium , each of the microstates have a corresponding statistical weight ( 43 ) . These weights are governed by concentration ( C A , B ) and dissociation constant ( K D , A / B ) of the proteins . The rate of depolymerization from the three states are d 0 ( free ) , d 1 , A ( protein A bound ) and d 1 , B ( protein B bound ) respectively . ( b ) Thermodynamic model for simultaneous interaction of two proteins at the barbed end . Each of the microstates have a corresponding equilibrium statistical weight ( 43 ) . These weights are governed by concentration ( C A , B ) and dissociation constant ( K D , A / B ) of the proteins . The rate of depolymerization from the four states are d 0 ( free ) , d 1 , A ( protein A bound ) , d 1 , B ( protein B bound ) and d 2 , AB ( both protein A and B simultaneously bound ) . ( c ) Average rate of barbed - end depolymerization ( D AB ) in presence of A alone ( red ) , B 11 alone ( green ) , and A and B together ( black ) as a function of their concentration for competitive binding model ( see SI ) . ( d ) Average rate of barbed - end depolymerization ( D AB ) in presence of A alone ( red ) , B alone ( green ) , and A and B together ( black ) as a function of their concentration for simultaneous binding model ( see SI ) . Next , we considered the second class of model , namely the simultaneous binding model ( Fig . 2b ) . In contrast to the competitive binding model , the simultaneous binding model can lead to an additional barbed - end state when the two proteins A and B are both simultaneously bound to the barbed end . Consequently , the barbed end can now exist in four distinct states - free , protein A bound , protein B bound or both protein A and B bound . The rate of depolymerization from these different states are given by – d 0 ( free ) , d 1 , A ( protein A bound ) , d 1 , B ( protein B bound ) and d 2 , AB ( both protein A and B simultaneously bound ) . The average depolymerization for this model is given by 0 , , 1 , , 1 , , 2 , , , , , , D A D B A A D B B B D A AB A B AB D A D B A D B B D A A B d K K d C K d C K d C C D K K C K C K C C + + + = + + + ( 4 ) where C A and C B are concentrations of the two proteins , and K D , A / B is the dissociation constant of protein A or B at the barbed end . A key assumption of our model is that the dissociation constants of either of the proteins remain unaffected by the presence of the other protein . The simultaneous binding model predicts that the average depolymerization rate in the presence of both proteins will either be additive or super - additive as compared to the individual depolymerization rates of proteins as shown in Fig . 2d . Overall , the competitive and cooperating models make distinct falsifiable predictions that can be tested experimentally and allow us to extract mechanistic insights into multicomponent depolymerization of actin , as we demonstrate in the ensuing sections . Profilin and twinfilin bind competitively to filament barbed ends We first asked how profilin and twinfilin together depolymerize actin filament barbed ends . X - ray diffraction structural studies indicate that twinfilin and profilin both bind to the barbed surface of actin monomers ( 40 , 42 , 45 ) . Based on this , we hypothesized that these proteins bind in a mutually exclusive manner to filament barbed ends as well . 12 Fig . 3 : Profilin and twinfilin bind filament barbed ends competitively . ( a ) Schematic depiction of the experimental strategy for measuring barbed - end depolymerization of ADP - P i actin filaments in simultaneous presence of twinfilin and profilin . Actin filaments with free barbed end were polymerized from coverslip - anchored spectrin - actin seeds by introducing 1 µM G - actin ( 15 % Alexa - 488 labeled ) and 4 µM profilin in modified TIRF buffer containing 50 mM P i . These filaments were then exposed to a flow containing twinfilin and profilin , and their rate of barbed - end ( BE ) depolymerization was monitored .

The experimental data was compared to predictions from competitive binding model of depolymerization ( black curve ) ( see SI ) . ( c ) Rate ( mean ± SD ) of barbed - end depolymerization in presence of range of concentrations of profilin alone ( red symbols ) or additionally supplemented with 5 µM twinfilin ( blue symbols ) . The number of filaments analyzed for each concentration of Profilin ( red symbols , left to right ) : 32 , 38 , 61 , 50 and 61 . Number of filaments analyzed for 5 µM twinfilin and profilin ( blue symbols , left to right ) : 60 , 60 , 60 , 60 , 60 and 60 . The experimental data was compared to predictions from competitive binding model of depolymerization ( black curve ) ( see SI ) . Similar to earlier experiments , free barbed ends of ADP - P i actin filaments were exposed to a solution containing both profilin ( human profilin - 1 ) and twinfilin ( mouse twinfilin - 1 ) ( Fig . 3a ) . We first systematically tuned the concentration of twinfilin while keeping profilin’s concentration fixed and compared the recorded depolymerization rates with that of twinfilin alone . In absence of profilin , increasing concentrations of twinfilin led to a monotonic increase followed by a 13 saturation at high concentrations ( ~ 5 µM ) . In sharp contrast , addition of profilin qualitatively altered the depolymerization behavior ; increasing concentrations of twinfilin ( in presence of profilin ) caused a monotonic decrease ( Fig . 3b ) . These depolymerization rates were then compared to predictions from our competitive binding model using Equation . 3 ( see supp . info ) . The model prediction matched the experimental data well , thereby validating our hypothesis that profilin and twinfilin bind to the filament barbed end in a mutually competitive manner ( Fig . 3b ) . To further validate the competitive binding model , we systematically varied the concentration of profilin keeping twinfilin concentration fixed ( Fig . 3c ) . We found that the experimental data were once again consistent with the predictions of the competitive binding model . Interestingly , as profilin concentration was tuned , presence of twinfilin did not alter the qualitative behavior of the observed rate of depolymerization . However quantitatively , the observed depolymerization rate in presence of both proteins always remained lower than of profilin alone . Profilin and cofilin can simultaneously occupy the same filament barbed end After validating profilin and twinfilin’s competitive binding to barbed ends , we decided to investigate how cofilin and profilin together impact barbed end depolymerization . Since twinfilin and cofilin belong to the same protein family , we hypothesized that they would bind the filament barbed end similarly . Therefore , we expected that similar to twinfilin , cofilin would also compete with profilin in a mutually exclusive fashion for the filament barbed ends . Indeed , earlier studies have shown that they both bind the barbed surface on actin monomers thereby indicating that they might bind filament barbed ends competitively ( 40 - 42 , 46 ) . Nevertheless , a direct demonstration has remained elusive . To this end , we decided to experimentally characterize filament depolymerization rates in the presence of these two proteins and then challenge the experimental results against predictions of our competitive binding model . We exposed free barbed ends of ADP - P i actin filaments to a solution containing either profilin and cofilin alone or together ( Fig . 4a ) . Keeping the concentration of profilin fixed , we first tuned the concentration of cofilin and compared the recorded depolymerization rates with that of cofilin alone ( Fig . 4b ) . In absence of profilin , increasing concentrations of cofilin led to a monotonic increase in depolymerization rate . However , the addition of profilin led to an overall increase in average depolymerization rates with increasing concentrations of cofilin . We then compared these experimental findings with predictions from our competitive binding model ( Equation . 3 ) . Contrary to our expectation , the competitive binding model failed to 14 capture the experimental data , thereby falsifying our hypothesis that profilin and cofilin bind filament ends mutually exclusively ( Fig . 4b ) . The experimentally measured average depolymerization rates were consistently greater than the depolymerization rates predicted by the competitive model across the probed concentration range . A similar behavior was observed when cofilin concentration was kept constant and profilin concentration was varied ( Fig 4c ) . Fig . 4 : Competitive binding model fails to explain simultaneous interaction of profilin and cofilin with barbed ends . ( a ) Schematic representation of the experimental strategy for measuring barbed end depolymerization of ADP - P i actin filaments in presence of cofilin and profilin . Actin filaments with free barbed end were polymerized from coverslip anchored spectrin - actin seeds by introducing 1 µM G - actin ( 15 % Alexa - 488 labeled ) and 4 µM profilin in modified TIRF buffer containing 50 mM P i . These filaments were then exposed to a flow containing cofilin and profilin , and the rate of depolymerization at their barbed ends ( BE ) was monitored .

The experimental data was compared to predictions from competitive ( purple ) and simultaneous ( blue ) binding models ( see SI ) . 15 We suspected the possibility of simultaneous binding of profilin and cofilin at the barbed end , which could potentially lead to such high experimentally observed depolymerization rates . To test this possibility , we employed the simultaneous binding model ( Equation . 4 ) , as defined in the earlier section . Unlike the competitive binding model where the filament barbed end could exist in three distinct states , namely free , profilin - bound and cofilin - bound , the simultaneous binding model entails an additional fourth state where both cofilin and profilin are simultaneously bound to the barbed end . This fourth state is characterized by its own distinct depolymerization rate . A priori , this rate cannot be determined from experiments characterizing the depolymerization rates of individual proteins ( Fig . 1d - f ) . Hence in order to test this model , we treated the depolymerization rate from the fourth state as a free parameter in our model . By tuning this depolymerization rate , we found that the simultaneous binding model indeed captured the experimentally measured depolymerization rates ( Fig . 4b , c ) . Interestingly , this theory - experiment dialog demonstrates that profilin and cofilin can occupy the barbed end simultaneously . Moreover , when present together , the resulting depolymerization rate is higher than that of individual proteins . In summary , we showed that cofilin and profilin can simultaneously occupy the actin filament barbed end thereby enhancing the rate of depolymerization . . Barbed - end bound twinfilin promotes association of cofilin After validating that while profilin competes with twinfilin and it can simultaneously occupy the same barbed end with cofilin , we then asked how cofilin and twinfilin together impact barbed - end depolymerization . Since twinfilin and cofilin both contain ADF / Cofilin homology domains , we hypothesized that these proteins would bind filament barbed ends in a mutually exclusive manner . To test this hypothesis , we measured barbed - end depolymerization of ADP - P i filaments in presence of these two proteins . Keeping the concentration of twinfilin fixed , we tuned the concentration of cofilin and compared the recorded depolymerization rates with that of cofilin alone ( Fig . 5a , b ) . In absence of twinfilin , increasing concentrations of cofilin led to a monotonic increase in depolymerization rate . In sharp contrast , addition of twinfilin qualitatively altered the depolymerization behavior ; increasing concentrations of cofilin ( in presence of twinfilin ) caused a monotonic decrease . Simultaneous presence of cofilin and twinfilin led to a significant reduction in the rate of depolymerization to values below 1 su / s ( Fig . 5b ) . A similar behavior was observed when twinfilin concentration was kept constant and cofilin concentration was varied ( Fig . 5c ) . A systematic comparison between experimental data with predictions from the competitive binding model falsified our hypothesis . Notably , while the 16 model predicted an increase in average depolymerization rate as a function of cofilin concentration ( at fixed twinfilin concentration ) , the experimental data showed the exact opposite trend . Next , we considered the possibility of twinfilin and cofilin simultaneously occupying the barbed end . This model also failed to explain the data . Taken together , we find that the experimental observations are inconsistent with both of our simple single - site barbed end binding models ( Supplementary Figure 2a , 2b ) . This implies that barbed - end interactions of these two proteins ( when simultaneously present ) might be more complex . Fig . 5 : Twinfilin and cofilin bind filament barbed ends competitively .

A recent study showed that binding of cofilin to the sides of ADP - actin filaments leads to a dramatic reduction in barbed - end depolymerization to rates lower than in control reactions ( 28 ) . Although , side binding of cofilin has so far mainly been studied in the context of ADP - actin filaments , acceleration of phosphate release by cofilin suggests that it can also interact ( albeit weakly ) with sides of ADP - P i actin filaments ( 47 , 48 ) . We therefore asked if considering side - binding of cofilin in addition to barbed end binding can explain our experimental findings . Since we did not observe a reduction in barbed end depolymerization even at high cofilin concentrations ( Fig . 1 ) , we wondered if the added presence of twinfilin might stabilize the weak - interactions of cofilin with sides of ADP - P i actin filaments , thereby reducing the depolymerization rate . Taking into account these possibilities , we expanded our barbed - end competitive model to include side binding of cofilin , aided by barbed - end presence of twinfilin . Specifically , we considered side - binding of one cofilin molecule per actin protofilament ( near the barbed end ) . In this revised competitive model , we used the cofilin side binding dissociation constant K D , SC = 181µM for newly assembled actin filaments ( i . e . , ADP - P i - F - actin ) as determined in a previous single - molecule study ( 49 ) and kept ω , the cooperativity between side binding of cofilin and barbed end - bound twinfilin as a free parameter ( Supplementary Figure 1b ) . To test this model , we fit it to our experimental data where we varied twinfilin at fixed cofilin concentration ( Fig . 5b ) . We found that this model captured experimental data well and allowed us to infer the free parameter ω . Using the inferred parameter , we predicted the effect of varying cofilin concentration at fixed twinfilin concentration ( Fig . 5c ) . The average depolymerization rate as predicted by the model matches the data well , thereby validating our revised competitive model . Taken together , our unique approach has enabled us to uncover a potentially new mechanism in which presence of twinfilin at the filament barbed end promotes the association of cofilin to filament sides which results in a dramatic reduction of barbed end depolymerization . Pair - wise interactions are sufficient to explain three - protein interactions Following pair - wise investigation of profilin , cofilin , and twinfilin , we asked if we could leverage our learnings from their pair - wise interactions to predict depolymerization dynamics of the barbed end when all three proteins were present simultaneously ( Fig . 6 ) . To this end , we 18 constructed a model for the three - protein case by combining their pair - wise interactions ( see Supplementary Figure 1c ) . This model makes specific predictions for the average depolymerization rate in the presence of all three proteins . In particular , we made two sets of predictions . First , we varied twinfilin concentration in presence of fixed concentration of profilin and cofilin . To our surprise , our model predicted a steeper drop in depolymerization rates upon addition of cofilin in comparison when only twinfilin and profilin were present ( Fig . 6b ) . Second , we varied cofilin concentration in presence of fixed concentration of twinfilin and profilin . Once again , our model predicted a much steeper drop in average depolymerization upon addition of profilin in comparison to when only cofilin and twinfilin were present ( Fig . 6c ) . We put these predictions to test using experiments . We find excellent agreement between the predictions and our experimental measurements . Taken together , our results show that pair - wise interactions alone are sufficient to predict multicomponent depolymerization dynamics resulting from three proteins . Fig . 6 : Three - protein model based on pairwise interactions fails to explain depolymerization dynamics in presence of profilin , twinfilin and cofilin .

Discussion A large array of proteins interact with actin filaments to facilitate intracellular actin assembly and remodeling ( 1 ) . Majority of these interactions occur at the barbed end of the actin filament ( 4 ) . As a result , these proteins can either bind filament barbed ends in a mutually exclusive manner or simultaneously associate with filament barbed ends . However , directly visualizing multiple proteins simultaneously interacting with the barbed end is technically challenging . Here we have presented an alternate approach that combines experimental measurements with predictive theoretical modelling to fill this gap . We show that high throughput measurements coupled with theory can help uncover features of multicomponent dynamics that would otherwise remain intractable . We believe our approach is especially useful when studying multicomponent dynamics of proteins that bind filament very transiently ( < < 1 s ) , as directly visualizing these short - lived interactions using classical methods like multicolor single - molecule imaging is not possible . In particular , we looked at three proteins – profilin , cofilin and twinfilin all of which individually depolymerize barbed ends of newly assembled ( ADP - P i ) actin filaments . To dissect how they simultaneously regulate actin depolymerization , we experimentally measured their effects individually , in pairs and all together , and then challenged these measurements against predictions of our theoretical models . 20 Cofilin and profilin compete for binding actin monomers ( 41 ) . We therefore hypothesized that the two proteins would also bind filament barbed ends in a mutually exclusive manner . To our surprise , we found that cofilin and profilin can simultaneously co - occupy filament barbed ends . Our analysis showed that the competitive binding model failed to explain the experimentally observed depolymerization rates when both cofilin and profilin are present . We instead found that the simultaneous binding model captured the experimentally observed depolymerization rates and therefore , supports the alternative possibility that cofilin and profilin can simultaneously occupy the actin filament barbed end . How do we structurally rationalize the simultaneous binding of these two proteins to filament barbed ends ? To do this , we used co - crystal structures of human profilin bound to an actin monomer ( 42 ) and ADF / cofilin homology domain bound to an actin monomer ( 40 ) . Both of these were docked on the two terminal actin subunits of an ADP - P i actin filament ( 50 ) . In agreement with Courtemanche and Pollard ( 16 ) , we found that while profilin can bind the terminal actin subunit ( n ) with minimal clashes , it clashes directly with the terminal actin subunit ( n ) when docked on the penultimate subunit ( n - 1 ) . This suggests that profilin’s interactions with the filament barbed end might originate solely from its interaction with the terminal barbed - end subunit . Upon docking the Cofilin / ADF homology domain on the actin filament , we however found that it could comfortably interact with both the terminal and penultimate actin subunits ( n and n - 1 ) at the barbed end . Taken together , our structural analysis suggests that the most likely explanation for our findings is that profilin binds to the terminal actin subunit and cofilin preferentially to the penultimate one , thus providing a pathway for them to be able to occupy the filament barbed end simultaneously . As a result , simultaneous presence of profilin and cofilin destabilizes both the subunits at the barbed end causing fastest ever depolymerization rates measured for ADP - P i barbed ends ( Fig . 4b - c ) . Since twinfilin and cofilin are both members of the ADF / Cofilin family of proteins , twinfilin would also be expected to simultaneously bind barbed ends with profilin . Surprisingly , our analysis showed that unlike cofilin and profilin , twinfilin and profilin bind barbed ends in a mutually exclusive manner . While twinfilin contains two connected ADF - Homology domains connected via a short peptide linker , cofilin only contains a single ADF - Homology domain . In absence of X - ray / cryo - EM structure of twinfilin - bound filament barbed ends , the mechanism of twinfilin - mediated depolymerization is less settled . Two separate modes of binding have been proposed . Twinfilin can either bind both the terminal and the penultimate actin subunits via its two ADF / Cofilin homology domains ( 45 ) or bind to only one of the two subunits at the barbed ends ( 26 ) . In the former configuration , twinfilin’s presence would sterically hinder profilin’s 21 association to both the terminal actin subunits . In the latter configuration , one of the ADF / cofilin homology domain of twinfilin would interact with either the terminal or the penultimate subunit and the second ADF / Cofilin domain would interact with the side of the actin filament ( 26 ) . In this scheme , the barbed end subunit not bound to twinfilin will still be able to interact with profilin . Based on these two alternative proposals , we developed kinetic models that made specific predictions about the observed depolymerization rate as a function of profilin and twinfilin concentration . Our experimental results favor the first proposal over the second i . e . , twinfilin associates with both the barbed - end subunits . Taken together , twinfilin’s presence at the filament barbed ends prevents profilin’s interactions with both actin subunits at the filament barbed end . Importantly , we note that these results also demonstrate the power of our theory - experiment approach – using profilin as a probe , our analysis has provided novel insights into twinfilin’s binding to and depolymerization of barbed ends . Since twinfilin and cofilin both contain ADF / Cofilin homology domains , we hypothesized that these proteins would bind filament barbed ends in a mutually exclusive manner . However , to our surprise , we found that the depolymerization dynamics for these two proteins could not be explained by our simple single - site competitive binding model . Specifically , we found that experimentally measured depolymerization rates in simultaneous presence of cofilin and twinfilin were always much slower than predicted by the model . What might explain this ? Cofilin readily decorates the sides of ADP filaments . At saturating concentrations , complete side decoration of actin filaments by cofilin leads to a 10 - fold reduction in barbed - end depolymerization compared to bare actin filaments ( 28 , 47 ) . However , we did not see a reduction in depolymerization rate of ADP - P i filaments even at high cofilin concentrations suggesting that cofilin alone might not stably decorate sides of actin filaments . We therefore wondered if the presence of twinfilin at the barbed end could stabilize interactions of weak interactions of cofilin with sides of ADP - Pi actin filaments . Indeed , our revised competitive model which includes cofilin side binding and its cooperative interactions with barbed - end bound twinfilin . Experimentally , it is extremely challenging to determine whether cofilin - mediated barbed end stabilization requires cofilin’s side binding only to the terminal actin subunits or to a much larger stretch of the actin filament . Our analysis has revealed that in presence of twinfilin , cofilin’s association to only the last two barbed end subunits might be sufficient to dramatically reduce barbed end depolymerization . After deciphering principles that govern two - protein interactions , we asked if these pair - wise interactions are sufficient to describe the dynamics of the system when all three proteins are 22 simultaneously present . To this end , we constructed a model for three - protein case explicitly incorporating the three sets of pair - wise interactions . This model made specific predictions for how the average depolymerization rates would change as we tuned the concentration of one of the proteins while we kept the other two fixed . In this case , pair - wise interactions were sufficient to explain our results from three - protein experiments indicating an absence of higher order interactions in this system unlike in other complex systems higher order interactions play a significant role in dictating multicomponent interactions ( 51 , 52 ) . Do the depolymerization mechanisms uncovered have in vivo relevance ? Two questions come up . Firstly , filaments at the leading edge exhibit lifetimes of only a few seconds ( 53 ) , which is about two orders of magnitude faster than timescales of P i release ( 0 . 002 s - 1 ) ( 48 , 54 ) . This discrepancy suggests that it is possible that filaments in vivo might entirely bypass the phosphate release step and get depolymerized in their ADP - P i state possibly by multicomponent mechanisms described here . Secondly , while the experiments in this study were conducted in the absence of actin monomers , cytoplasm is thought to contain up to 100 µM monomeric actin , mostly bound to either profilin or thymosin β4 . As a result , availability of free profilin in the cytosol remains unclear . A study from the Pollard lab found that up to 40 % of total profilin might be free of G - actin in the acanthamoeba cytosol ( 55 ) . Further , a recent study from Bieling lab suggested that about 25 to 50 µM free profilin might be present in the cytoplasm of vertebrate lymphocytes and dendritic cells ( 56 ) . These estimates of free profilin assume that about 50 % of total cytosolic actin remains in the filamentous state and the other half in monomeric state ( 30 , 57 ) . Further , it is important to recognize that to gain mechanistic insights into how these regulators act at the barbed end , it is preferable to work under simple conditions in which no interference occurs from the interaction of these proteins with actin monomers . It is thus an important step towards understanding more complex intracellular conditions . In summary , we implemented a bottom - up approach that builds on single protein measurements to shed light on emergent multi - protein behavior . Single protein measurements allow for the extraction of various rate constants , which can be utilized to build predictive models of multi - protein regulation of actin dynamics . These models can be falsified through a rigorous comparison of their predictions with experimental data . While we used this approach to shed new light on actin depolymerization by profilin , cofilin , and twinfilin , we believe this approach should be generally applicable to decipher of how living cells integrate activities of multiple proteins to regulate complex intracellular actin dynamics . 23 Acknowledgements : We thank Heidi Ulrichs for purifying profilin .

These filaments were then exposed to profilin , cofilin and twinfilin ( alone or together ) in modified - TIRF buffer . Barbed end depolymerization of these filaments was monitored . All experiments were conducted at room temperature . 27 Image acquisition and analysis Single - wavelength time - lapse TIRF imaging was performed on a Nikon - Ti2000 inverted microscope equipped with a 40 mW 488 nm Argon laser , a 60X TIRF - objective with a numerical aperture of 1 . 49 ( Nikon Instruments Inc . , USA ) and an IXON LIFE 888 EMCCD camera ( Andor Ixon , UK ) . One pixel was equivalent to 144 × 144 nm . Focus was maintained by the Perfect Focus system ( Nikon Instruments Inc . , Japan ) . Time - lapsed images were acquired every 10 s using Nikon Elements imaging software ( Nikon Instruments Inc . , Japan ) . Images were analyzed in Fiji ( 58 ) . Background subtraction was conducted using the rolling ball background subtraction algorithm ( ball radius 5 pixels ) . For each condition , between 50 and 100 filaments were acquired across multiple fields of view . To determine the rate of depolymerization , the in - built kymograph plugin was used to draw kymographs of individual filaments . The kymograph slope was used to calculate barbed end depolymerization rate of each individual filament ( assuming one actin subunit contributes 2 . 7 nm to filament length ) . Data analysis and curve fitting were carried out in Microcal Origin . All experiments were repeated multiple times and yielded similar results . Data shown are from one trial . The predictions for the models were calculated using custom - written code in MATLAB . 28 References 1 . P . Lappalainen , T . Kotila , A . Jegou , G .

Two - state model of depolymerization characterizes single - protein binding to barbed end We developed a simple thermodynamic model that employs tools from equilibrium statistical mechanics to characterize how a protein affects the depolymerization of actin barbed end . In this model , a protein P binds to the barbed end of a filament , thereby modulating its observed depolymerization rate . The filament barbed end can either be in a bare state or a protein - bound state , as shown in Supplementary Figure 1a . The equilibrium probabilities of occupancy of these two states can be computed using equilibrium statistical mechanics ( 43 ) . The statistical weights corresponding to these discrete states are given by w 0 = 1 , and w 1 = C P / K D , P . Correspondingly , the partition function of the system is defined as the sum of the statistical weights ( w i ) i . e . , , i i Z w =  , 1 . P D P C K = + ( 1 ) where C P is the concentration of the protein and dissociation constant is K D , P . Notably , knowledge of partition function fully specifies all the equilibrium statistical properties of the system . Using Equation ( 1 ) , we obtained the equilibrium probabilities of occupying the bare state ( p 0 ) and protein - bound state ( p 1 ) which are given by 0 0 , w p Z = 1 , 1 P D C K = + 0 . D P D K p C K = + ( 2 ) 1 1 , w p Z = 34 , 1 P D P D C K C K = + 1 . P P D C p C K = + ( 3 ) The average depolymerization rate D P of a filament , as measured in experiments , can then be written as : 0 0 1 1 , P D d p d p = + ( 4 ) Using equation ( 4 ) and substituting for p 0 and p 1 from Equation ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , we obtain the average depolymerization rate given by : 0 1 0 1 . D P D P P P D D P P D d K d C K C D d d C K K C C K     + = + =     + + +     ( 5 ) To quantitively characterize how a single protein affects barbed end depolymerization , we compared the two - state model , as shown in Fig . 1f - h to experimental data . From our experiments we extracted the average depolymerization rate as a function of protein concentration for each protein of interest . We fitted the two - state model to the depolymerization data using Equation ( 5 ) to extract the relevant parameters K D , and d 1 ( see Table . 1 in main text ) . Parameter d 0 = 0 . 5 sub / s was extracted from experimental data . 2 . Competititve and simultaneous binding models characterize two - protein binding to barbed end To decipher the mechanism of how two proteins together bind actin barbed end to affect its depolymerization , we developed two broad classes of thermodynamic models , namely competitive and simultaneous binding models . In the competitive model , two proteins bind the barbed end in a mutually exclusive manner , whereby either one of them occupies the barbed end at a given moment . In contrast , in the simultaneous binding model , two proteins can simultaneously occupy the same barbed end . Below , we explain the models in detail . 2 . 1 Competitive binding model 35 In this model , two proteins A and B bind the barbed end in a competitive manner . As a result , the barbed end can be either in a protein unbound state with probability p 0 , protein A bound state with probability p 1 , A , or protein B bound state with probability p 1 , B as shown in figure 2a . Each of these three states is characterized by its distinct depolymerization rate – d 0 ( free ) , d 1 , A ( protein A bound ) and d 1 , B ( protein B bound ) . Here , the equilibrium probabilities p 0 , p 1 , A , and p 1 , B can be computed using the partition function as described in the previous section which are given by : 0 , , 1 , 1 B A D B D A p C C K K = + + , , 0 , , , , , D A D B B D A D A D B A D B K K p C K K K C K = + + ( 6 ) , 1 , , , , , , , D B A A B D A D A D B A D B K C p C K K K C K = + + ( 7 ) , 1 , , , , , . D A B B B D A D A D B A D B K C p C K K K C K = + + ( 8 ) where C A and C B are concentrations of the two proteins , and K D , A / B is the dissociation constant of protein A or B at the barbed end . Average depolymerization rate when two proteins A and B compete for barbed end of actin filament can then be written as : 0 0 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , . AB A A B B D d p d p d p = + + ( 9 ) Using Eqn . ( 9 ) and substituting for p 0 , p 1 , A , and p 1 , B from Equation ( 6 ) , ( 7 ) , and ( 8 ) , we obtain the average depolymerization rate when two proteins A and B compete for barbed end of actin filament , given by : 0 , , 1 , , 1 , , , , , , . D A D B A A D B B B D A AB D A D B A D B B D A d K K d C K d C K D K K C K C K + + = + + ( 10 ) 36 The competitive binding model has five parameters namely , d 0 , K D , A , K D , B , d 1 , A , and d 1 , B . These parameters are known from our single - protein studies , as elucidated in section . 1 ( see Table . 1 in main text ) . Parameter d 0 = 0 . 5 sub / s was extracted from experimental data . Using Equation ( 10 ) , we predicted average depolymerization as a function of concentration of A and B , which was tested against experimental data as shown in Fig . 3b , c , and 4b , c 2 . 2 Simultaneous binding model In contrast to the competitive binding model , the simultaneous binding model can lead to an additional barbed end state when the two proteins A and B are both simultaneously bound to the barbed end . Consequently , the barbed end can now exist in either in a protein unbound state with probability p 0 , protein A bound state with probability p 1 , A , protein B bound state with probability p 1 , B , or both protein A and B bound state with probability p 2 , AB as shown in Supplementary Figure 2b . The rate of depolymerization from these different states are given by – d 0 ( free ) , d 1 , A ( protein A bound ) , d 1 , B ( protein B bound ) and d 2 , AB ( both protein A and B simultaneously bound ) . Here , the equilibrium probabilities p 0 , p 1 , A , p 1 , B and p 2 , AB can be computed using the partition function as described in the previous section which are given by : , , 0 , , , , , D A D B D A D B A D B B D A A B K K p K K C K C K C C = + + + ( 11 ) , 1 , , , , , , A D B A D A D B A D B B D A A B C K p K K C K C K C C = + + + ( 12 ) , 1 , , , , , , B D A B D A D B A D B B D A A B C K p K K C K C K C C = + + + ( 13 ) 2 , , , , , .

The average depolymerization for this model is given by : 0 0 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 2 , 2 , . AB A A B B AB AB D d p d p d p d p = + + + ( 15 ) Using equation ( 15 ) and substituting for p 0 , p 1 , A , p 1 , B , and p 2 , AB from equation ( 11 ) , ( 12 ) , ( 13 ) , and ( 14 ) we obtain the average depolymerization rate , when two proteins A and B can simultaneously occupy barbed end of actin filament , given by : 0 , , 1 , , 1 , , 2 , , , , , . D A D B A A D B B B D A AB A B AB D A D B A D B B D A A B d K K d C K d C K d C C D K K C K C K C C + + + = + + + ( 16 ) We used Equation ( 16 ) to predict average depolymerization rate when two proteins bind barbed end cooperatively which is tested against experimental data as shown in figure 4 ( b , c ) . These parameters ( d 1 , A / B and K D , A / B ) are known from our single - protein studies , as elucidated in section . 1 ( see Table . 1 in main text ) . Parameter d 0 = 0 . 5 sub / s was extracted from experimental data . Parameter d 2 , AB was varied , and we found that d 2 , AB = 11sub / s explained the experimental results best in case of profilin and cofilin . 2 . 3 Revised competitive binding model for Cofilin and Twinfilin In this model , in addition to the competitive binding of cofilin and twinfilin to the barbed end , cofilin can also bind the sides of the filament . Such side - binding of cofilin can significantly reduce the depolymerization of barbed end , as has been seen previously ( 28 ) . Here we consider the rate of depolymerization to be zero when two cofilin molecules are bound to the side of the actin filament near the barbed end ( one molecule per actin protofilaments ) and twinfilin is simultaneously present at the barbed end . In this model , there are nine possible configurations , as shown in Supplementary Figure 1b . There are three states each for i ) barbed end binding , ii ) barbed end binding and one cofilin molecule binding to one of the protofilaments near the barbed end , and iii ) barbed end binding and two cofilin molecules binding to two of the protofilaments near the barbed end . The equilibrium weights of these 38 configurations can be computed using the partition function as described in the previous section which are given by : 1 , , , C C D C C w k = 1 , , , T T D T C w k = 1 , 0 , 2 , C S D S C C w k = 2 1 , , , 2 , C S C D C D S C C w k k = 1 , , , 2 , C T S T D T D SC C C w k k = 2 2 , 0 2 , , C S D S C C w k = 3 2 , 2 , , , C S C D C D SC C w k k = 2 2 , 2 , , , C T S T D T D S C C C w k k  = ( 17 ) where C C , and C T , are concentrations of cofilin and twinfilin , K D , C / T is the dissociation constant of protein cofilin and twinfilin at the barbed end , K D , SC is the dissociation constant of cofilin at the side of the filament next to the barbed end , and ω is the cooperativity between side binding of two cofilin molecules to the two of the protofilaments near the barbed end and barbed end - bound twinfilin . The rate of depolymerization from these different states are given by – d 0 ( free ) , d 1 , C ( cofilin bound ) , d 2 , T ( twinfilin bound ) and d 2 , TC ( side binding of cofilin to the two of the protofilaments near the barbed end and barbed end bound twinfilin ) . The average depolymerization for this model can be calculated using corresponding weights and depolymerization rates of the nine states as given by : 0 1 , w = 39 0 0 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 1 , 0 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 2 , 0 1 , 2 , 2 , 2 , . C C T T S C S C T S T S C S C T C S T AB i i d w d w d w d w d w d w d w d w d w D w + + + + + + + + =  ( 18 ) We used Equation ( 18 ) after plugging in weights from Equation ( 17 ) to predict average depolymerization rate when cofilin and twinfilin interact with barbed end which is tested against experimental data as shown in figure 5 ( b , c ) . These parameters ( d 1 , C / T and K D , C / T ) are known from our single - protein studies , as elucidated in section . 1 ( see Table . 1 in main text ) . Parameter d 0 = 0 . 5 sub / s was extracted from experimental data . The parameter K D , SC = 181µM was taken from a previous study ( 49 ) , and ω was varied and we found that ω = 1084 . 1 explained the experimental results best . The depolymerization rate when two cofilin molecules bind two of the protofilaments near the barbed end and simultaneously twinfilin is bound to the barbed end is taken to be zero , i . e . , d 2 , TC = 0 . 3 . Three protein case We combined the pair - wise interactions of profilin , twinfilin , and cofilin to predict the average depolymerization rate in the presence of three proteins , as shown in Supplementary Figure 1c . As before , the equilibrium weights of the various states are computed from the partition function . These weights are given by : 0 1 , w = 1 , , , C C D C C w k = 1 , , , P P D P C w k = 1 , , , T T D T C w k = 2 , , , , C P PC D P D C C C w k k = 1 , 0 , 2 , C S D SC C w k = 2 1 , , , 2 , C S C D C D SC C w k k = 40 1 , , , 2 , C T S T D T D SC C C w k k = 2 2 , 0 2 , , C S D S C C w k = 3 2 , 2 , , , C S C D C D S C C w k k = 2 2 , 2 , , , C T S T D T D SC C C w k k  = ( 19 ) The rate of depolymerization from these different states are given by d 0 ( free ) , d 1 , C ( cofilin bound ) , d 1 , P ( profilin bound ) , d 1 , T ( twinfilin bound ) , d 2 , PC ( both profilin and cofilin simultaneously bound ) , and d 2 , TC ( twinfilin is bound on the barbed end and cofilin is occupying two binding sites on the side ) depolymerization rates . Here C P , C C , and C T are concentrations of the three proteins , K D , P / C / T is the dissociation constant of profilin , cofilin , and twinfilin at the barbed end , and K D , SC is the dissociation constant of cofilin on the side of the filament next to the barbed end . The average depolymerization for this model is given by : 0 0 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 . 1 , 1 , 2 , 2 , 0 1 , 0 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 2 , 0 1 , 2 , 2 , 2 , .

These parameters ( d 1 , C / P / T and K D , P / C / T ) are known from our single - protein studies , as elucidated in section . 1 ( see Table . 1 in main text ) . Parameter d 0 = 0 . 5 sub / s was extracted from experimental data . Parameters d 2 , PC = 11 sub / s , d 2 , TC = 0 sub / s , K D , SC = 181 µM , and ω = 1084 . 1 were obtained from the previous sections .
