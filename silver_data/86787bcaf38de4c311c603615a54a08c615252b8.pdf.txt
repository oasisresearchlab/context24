Using structure - based mutagenesis and neuron - based screening , we developed a family of ultra - sensitive protein calcium sensors ( GCaMP6 ) that outperformed other sensors in cultured neurons and in zebrafish , flies , and mice in vivo . In layer 2 / 3 pyramidal neurons of the mouse visual cortex , GCaMP6 reliably detected single action potentials in neuronal somata and orientation - tuned synaptic calcium transients in individual dendritic spines . The orientation tuning of structurally persistent spines was largely stable over timescales of weeks . Orientation tuning averaged across spine populations predicted the tuning of their parent cell . Although the somata of GABAergic neurons showed little orientation tuning , their dendrites included highly tuned dendritic segments ( 5 - 40 micrometers long ) . GCaMP6 sensors thus provide new windows into the organization and dynamics of neural circuits over multiple spatial and temporal scales .

HH M I A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t HH M I A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t HH M I A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t Introduction Neural activity causes rapid changes in intracellular free calcium 1 - 4 . Calcium imaging experiments have relied on this principle to track the activity of neuronal populations 5 , 6 and to probe excitation of small neurons and neuronal microcompartments 2 , 7 - 10 . Genetically - encoded protein sensors can be targeted to specific cell types 2 , 9 , 11 , 12 for non - invasive imaging of identified neurons and neuronal compartments 8 , 13 - 15 over chronic timescales 6 . Calcium indicator proteins include the single fluorophore sensor GCaMP 11 , 16 , 17 and several families of Förster resonance energy transfer based sensors 18 - 22 . However , none of these protein - based indicators have yet surpassed the sensitivity and speed of commonly used synthetic calcium indicators ( e . g . , Oregon Green Bapta - 1 - AM , OGB1 - AM ) . Therefore , depending on the experimental goals , investigators choose between sensitive synthetic indicators delivered by invasive chemical or physical methods , or less sensitive protein sensors delivered with genetic methods . Multiple rounds of structure - guided design have made GCaMPs the most widely used protein calcium sensors 11 , 16 , 17 . But past efforts in optimizing GCaMPs and other indicators of neuronal function were limited by the throughput of quantitative and physiologically relevant assays . Because neurons have unusually fast calcium dynamics and low peak calcium accumulations 4 , sensors designed to probe neuronal function are best tested in neurons 11 , 13 , 23 , 24 , rather than in non - neuronal systems , most of which show much slower and larger calcium changes 19 . We thus screened GCaMP variants produced by mutagenesis in neurons , and subsequently validated lead sensors in several in vivo systems . GCaMP protein engineering GCaMP 17 and its progeny 11 , 16 consist of circularly permuted green fluorescent protein ( cpGFP ) 25 , the calcium - binding protein calmodulin ( CaM ) , and CaM - interacting M13 peptide 26 ( Fig . 1a ) . The CaM / M13 complex is in proximity to the chromophore inside the cpGFP β barrel 27 . Calcium - dependent conformational changes in CaM / M13 , including modulation of solvent access and the pK a of the chromophore , cause increased brightness with calcium binding . Despite extensive structure - guided optimization 11 , 16 , GCaMP and other protein sensors still suffer from low sensitivity and slow kinetics . We produced numerous additional GCaMP variants and tested them in automated neuronal assays ( Fig . 1 ) . With the aim of improving sensitivity , we focused mutagenesis on the interface between cpGFP and CaM at 16 amino acid positions , some mutagenized to near completion ( Fig . 1a , Supplementary Table 5 ) 16 . Mutations were made at 18 additional sites , notably at the M13 / CaM interface which can affect calcium affinity 28 ( A317 ) and in CaM ( R392 ) 16 ( Fig . 1a ) . Dissociated rat hippocampal neurons in 24 - well plates were transduced with GCaMP variants ( one per well ) , together with nuclear mCherry 29 , using lentivirus - mediated gene transfer . Electrodes triggered trains of action potentials in all neurons within each well ( Methods ) . Time - lapse images ( 35 Hz ) of ∼ 800 μm fields of view containing 10 - 100 neurons were acquired , while delivering a series of action potential trains ( Fig . 1c ) . Chen et al . Page 2 Nature . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2014 January 18 . HH M I A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t HH M I A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t HH M I A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t Fluorescence changes extracted from single neurons were used to compare the sensitivity , dynamic range , and kinetics of individual GCaMP variants and OGB1 - AM ( Fig . 1d ) . We monitored the resting brightness of the sensor by measuring green fluorescence relative to red mCherry fluorescence . The assay revealed 43 / 348 point mutants with improved sensitivity compared to GCaMP3 ( ΔF / F 0 in response to one action potential ; p < 0 . 01 ; Wilcoxon rank sum test ) ( Fig . 1c ; Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . In addition , one mutation at the M13 / CaM interface ( A317E ) accelerated kinetics ( 4 - fold ) , but also reduced response amplitude ( 2 - fold ) , compared to parent GCaMP variants ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . In a second round of mutagenesis we combined beneficial mutations , selected based on improved response amplitudes ( 1 - 3 action potentials ) and / or kinetics , without compromising baseline fluorescence or maximal response ( 160 action potentials ) ( 94 variants , up to 8 beneficial point mutations ; Fig . 1a , c , Supplementary Table 5 ) . In some cases the beneficial effects were additive ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . A317E consistently accelerated the kinetics compared to the parent sensors . In total , we screened 447 GCaMP variants ( Supplementary Table 5 ) . Based on screening in cultured neurons ( Fig . 1 ) , we chose three ultrasensitive GCaMP6 sensors ( GCaMP6s , 6m , 6f ; for slow , medium and fast kinetics , respectively ) for characterization in vivo . These sensors vary in kinetics , with the more sensitive sensors having slower kinetics . Compared to GCaMP5G , the GCaMP6 sensors have similar baseline brightness and a 1 . 1 - 1 . 6 fold increase in dynamic range ( ΔF / F0 at 160 action potentials ) . For small numbers of action potentials the most sensitive sensor , GCaMP6s , produced 7 - fold larger signals ( > 10 - fold larger than GCaMP3 , Fig . 1b - e ; Supplementary Table 1 ) . Underlying this sensitivity gain are multiple factors ( Supplementary Table 2 ) . Compared to GCaMP5G , GCaMP6s exhibited 3 - fold higher apparent affinity for calcium and 1 . 3 - fold higher saturated fluorescence , with similar baseline fluorescence . Calcium - saturated GCaMP6s is 27 % brighter than enhanced GFP ( EGFP ) , its parent fluorescent protein . The fastest sensor , GCaMP6f , had 2 - fold faster rise time and 1 . 7 - fold faster decay time than GCaMP5G ( Fig . 1f , g ) ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . GCaMP6f is the fastest genetically - encoded calcium indicator for cytoplasmic free calcium in neurons , with sensitivity comparable to OGB1 - AM ( Fig . 1d - g ) . GCaMP6 indicators were more sensitive and / or faster than other GCaMP variants in presynaptic boutons of the Drosophila larval neuromuscular junction 24 ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ; Supplementary Table 4 ) , in projection neurons of the Drosophila adult antennal lobe during odor presentation 16 ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) , and in neuropil and somata of the zebrafish tectum in vivo 16 ( Supplementary Fig . 5 ) . Imaging neuronal populations in the mouse visual cortex We next tested GCaMP6 in layer ( L ) 2 / 3 pyramidal neurons in the mouse visual cortex V1 in vivo ( Fig . 2a ) . The majority of V1 neurons can be driven to fire action potentials in response to drifting gratings 30 . V1 was infected with adeno - associated virus ( AAV ) expressing GCaMP variants ( AAV - hsyn1 - GCaMP variant ) 11 . Three weeks after AAV infection , the vast majority of L2 / 3 neurons showed fluorescence mainly in the neuronal cytoplasm ( Supplementary Fig . 6 ) . Sensory stimuli consisted of moving gratings presented in eight directions to the contralateral eye 12 , 16 . Two - photon imaging revealed visual stimulus - Chen et al . Page 3 Nature . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2014 January 18 . HH M I A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t HH M I A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t HH M I A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t evoked fluorescence transients in subsets of neurons ( Fig . 2a - c ) . These responses were stable across trials ( Supplementary Fig . 8 ) and tuned to stimulus orientation ( Fig . 2a , b and Supplementary Fig . 9 ) . Orientation tuning was similar for GCaMP5G , GCaMP6f , GCaMP6m , and bulk - loaded OGB1 - AM 5 ( Supplementary Fig . 9 ) . Fluorescence transients were faster with GCaMP6f compared to other sensors and faithfully tracked dynamic sensory stimuli ( Fig . 2d ) . GCaMP6 performance was compared to other sensors in several ways . The fraction of responding neurons detected with GCaMP6s was 3 - fold higher than for GCaMP5G ( 5 - fold higher than GCaMP3 ) ( Fig . 2e ) . Notably , the fractions of active neurons detected with GCaMP6s and GCaMP6m were also significantly higher than for OGB1 - AM ( Fig . 2e , f , p < 0 . 01 , Wilcoxon rank sum test ) . GCaMP6 sensors thus reveal neuronal dynamics that were previously undetectable with protein sensors . We imaged GCaMP6s - expressing neurons through a chronic imaging window 6 , 31 over several weeks in V1 ( Supplementary Fig . 6c ) 18 . Sensory responses and orientation tuning of neurons were largely stable ( Supplementary Fig . 6c , e ) . Responses of a small fraction of neurons were lost over time , which was balanced by other neurons that started responding . The orientation preference of the neurons responding in all imaging sessions ( ∼ 56 % of cells that responded in the first session ) was remarkably stable ( Supplementary Fig . 6d ) . Over months of expression a small fraction of highly expressing neurons acquired nuclear fluorescence ; these neurons eventually also developed aberrant responses 11 ( Supplementary Fig . 7 ) . These experiments indicate that expression of GCaMP6s over 1 - 2 months does not obviously perturb the function of cortical circuits . We directly compared cellular fluorescence changes and spiking using loose - seal , cell - attached recordings . The contrast of the visual stimulus was adjusted online to maintain a moderate spike rate . GCaMP6s produced large fluorescence transients even in response to single action potentials ( > 6 times larger than for GCaMP5K , Fig . 3 and Supplementary Video 1 ) , yielding high detection rates for single spikes ( 99 ± 0 . 2 % ; at 1 % false - positive rate , n = 9 cells , 250 spikes ) . GCaMP6f and GCaMP6m showed slightly lower spike detection efficiencies , but with faster kinetics ( Fig . 3 , Supplementary Table 3 ) . Individual spikes within a burst resulted in step - wise fluorescence increases ( Fig . 3b ) , which were resolvable if they were separated by an interval on the order of the rise time of the sensor or more ( 100 - 150 ms , GCaMP6s ; 75 - 100 ms , GCaMP6m ; 50 - 75 ms , GCaMP6f ; Fig . 3f , Supplementary Fig . 10 , Supplementary Table 3 ) . These data show that GCaMP6s can detect activity with near 100 % action potential detection in pyramidal cells . Calcium transients in dendritic spines Pyramidal neuron output is shaped by thousands of excitatory synapses distributed across the dendritic arbor . Activation of single excitatory synapses causes calcium accumulations in individual dendritic spines , mediated by NMDA - Rs 32 , 33 , which can be imaged to measure the tuning of single synapses in vivo 10 , 33 . We used GCaMP6s to image synaptic calcium signals within dendritic spines over chronic timescales . In V1 with sparsely labeled L2 / 3 pyramidal neurons ( Methods ) small dendritic branches were imaged at high magnification during visual stimulation ( Fig . 4a ) . We first focused on neurons that did not fire visually Chen et al . Page 4 Nature . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2014 January 18 . HH M I A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t HH M I A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t HH M I A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t evoked action potentials ( ∼ 40 % of neurons ) to avoid calcium changes caused by action potentials back - propagating into dendrites 7 . Individual spines showed large fluorescence transients , often independent of their parent dendrites ( Fig . 4b , d and Supplementary Video 2 ) . Spine responses were orientation - tuned ( Fig . 4b - e ) , as expected from the fact that most input to V1 neurons originates from ( presumably orientation - tuned ) V1 neurons 34 . Neighboring spines were often tuned with different preferred orientations . The correlation between orientation tuning and distance between spines was weak ( R = 0 . 08 ; p > 0 . 05 ) . Overall , 27 % of spines ( 62 / 228 , 15 dendrites , 4 mice ) were visually responsive , and most were orientation - tuned ( Fig . 4f , g ) . Furthermore , close to 40 % of spines were active at some time during the imaging session ( Fig . 4f ) . Bleaching of GCaMP6 was negligible over 40 imaging trials ( 320 s of continuous imaging , Fig . 4h ) . We imaged the same dendritic segments over imaging sessions separated by weeks . Most spines persisted over this timescale , although other spines appeared and disappeared 31 . We analyzed the visual responses of persistent spines . The percentage of spines that responded to visual stimulation was stable over a week ( 37 / 139 on day 1 ; 34 / 139 on day 8 ) . Spines that responded during one imaging session were also likely to respond a week later ( 65 % ) . Furthermore , visually responsive spines mostly retained their orientation tuning ( Fig . 4i - k ) . How orientation - tuned neurons connect to other orientation - tuned neurons remains controversial 10 , 35 . Some measurements suggest that individual neurons sample heterogeneous input , from neurons with diverse orientation - tuning 10 . Models indicate that specific connectivity is not required for orientation tuning 36 . However , other measurements emphasize that neurons prefer to make synapses with neurons sharing similar orientation tuning 35 , but orientation tuning at the level of subthreshold membrane potential is weak 37 , 38 . We thus compared the orientation tuning of populations of individual spines and the output of their parent neuron . We identified neurons with tuned output ( OSI , 0 . 91 ± 0 . 04 , n = 5 ) ( Fig . 5a ) and measured the orientation tuning of large numbers of dendritic spines per neuron ( average , 201 spines ; range , 120 - 298 spines ) ( Fig . 5b - d ) . Contributions to the signal from back - propagating action potentials were removed using a computational subtraction procedure ( Methods ; Supplementary Fig . 11 ) . For individual neurons , the orientation tuning averaged across all spines was biased towards the orientation tuning of the parent neurons ( Fig . 5e , f ) ( p < 0 . 01 , Wilcoxon rank sum test ) , although the modulation depth for spines was smaller ( p < 0 . 01 , Wilcoxon rank sum test ) . A similar trend was also apparent in the distributions of preferred orientations across spines ( Fig . 5g , h ) . Our results show that spine fluorescence transients , which are not necessarily good predictors of the strength of excitatory synaptic input 39 , averaged across a neuron predict the orientation tuning of the cell ' s output . Calcium transients in GABAergic dendrites Consistent with previous results 40 , 41 , somatic fluorescence changes in GABAergic neurons were broadly tuned with respect to stimulus orientation ( Fig . 6a , b ; Supplementary Fig . 12 ) . However , their dendrites showed pronounced orientation - tuned domains ( Fig . 6c , d ) . Individual dendritic branches often had multiple domains with distinct preferred orientations , consistent with the diverse preferences of inputs to GABAergic neurons 42 , 43 . Chen et al . Page 5 Nature . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2014 January 18 . HH M I A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t HH M I A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t HH M I A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t The underlying fluorescence responses were modulated at the temporal frequency of the drifting grating ( 1 Hz ) ( Fig . 6e ) , a characteristic feature of V1 excitatory neurons in the superficial layers of V1 30 , suggesting that the responses reflect local excitatory synaptic input . Tuned dendritic domains were seen in parvalbumin - positive ( Fig . 6 ) and somatostatin - positive ( data not shown ) interneurons . We mapped the visual response along 104 interneuron dendrites ( total imaged length 6 . 3 mm ) with regions of interest placed every micrometer along the dendrite ( Fig . 6d ) . Visually - evoked GCaMP6s responses were detected in 5 . 7 mm ( 90 % ) of dendritic length , with 1 . 79 mm ( 28 % ) showing significant orientation - tuning ( p < 0 . 01 , ANOVA across 8 conditions ) . The majority of imaged dendrites ( 33 / 54 ; longer than 50 μm ) had multiple domains preferring different orientations . The OSI ( 0 . 44 ± 0 . 15 ; mean ± s . d . ) of tuned dendritic segments was higher than for interneuron somata ( p < 0 . 005 , Supplementary Fig . 12 ) , but lower than for typical pyramidal neurons ( p < 0 . 001 , Supplementary Fig . 9 ) . Back - propagation 44 of broadly tuned somatic action potentials probably lowers the OSI of the dendritic calcium signals . Consistent with this , both the dendritic OSI and the percentage of orientation selective sites increased with distance from the soma ( Supplementary Fig . 13a ) . The sizes of individual domains ( 12 ± 7 μm , mean ± s . d . FWHM , n = 107 domains ) were considerably larger than the spacing between excitatory synapses on interneuron dendrites ( < 1 μm ) 45 ( Supplementary Fig . 13b , c ) . Nearby domains with distinct preferred orientations often overlapped ( Supplementary Fig . 13b ) . The large size of these domains might reflect spatially clustered input with shared orientation preference . Alternatively , individual domains might be dominated by a few sparse , randomly distributed strong inputs 46 , amplified by local postsynaptic mechanisms 47 Conclusions We developed a new class of genetically - encoded indicators of neuronal function with greatly improved properties . GCaMP6 indicators cross important performance thresholds . They have higher sensitivity than commonly used synthetic calcium dyes ( e . g . , OGB1 ) and detect individual action potentials with high reliability at reasonable microscope magnifications . These indicators can be used to image large groups of neurons as well as tiny synaptic compartments over multiple imaging sessions separated by months . It is likely that these sensors will find widespread applications for diverse problems in brain research and calcium signaling . Future engineering efforts could focus on red fluorescent calcium indicator proteins 48 , 49 , which promise imaging considerably deeper in scattering tissue 50 .

HH M I A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t HH M I A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t HH M I A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t Neuronal culture screen GCaMP variants were made in a modified SIV - based lentiviral construct , pGP - syn - GCaMP - nls - mCherry - WPRE , derived from pCL20cSLFR MSCV - GFP 51 . The prolentiviral vector included a 476 - bp human synapsin promoter , GCaMP , a nuclear localization sequence fused to mCherry , and the woodchuck hepatitis post - transcriptional regulatory element . Site - directed mutagenesis was conducted by PCR and mutated regions were incorporated into the lentiviral constructs by gene assembly 52 . Hippocampi were dissected and dissociated in papain . Cells were plated at a density of 225 , 000 viable cells / well in 24 - well glass - bottom plates ( Mattek , # 1 . 5 glass coverslips ) , pre - coated with Matrigel ( BD Biosciences ) . Cells were cultured in growth medium ( 28 mM glucose , 2 . 4 mM sodium bicarbonate , 100 μg / mL transferrin , B - 27 supplement ( 1X , Invitrogen ) , 500 μM L - glutamine , 50 units / mL penicillin , 50 mg / mL streptomycin , 5 % fetal bovine serum in MEM ) . Lentiviral particles were made in a biosafety level 2 laboratory by transfecting a prolentiviral construct and packaging and coat pseudotyping DNA constructs ( pCAG - SIVgprre , pCAG4 - RTR - SIV , pCMV - VSV - G ) 51 , 53 into HEK293T / 17 cells ( ATCC ) in 10 - cm plates . After 72 h , supernatant was collected ( 6 mL ) and filtered . Neuronal cultures were infected at 3 days in vitro . Each well of a 24 - well plate was incubated overnight with 0 . 5 mL of lentivirus in conditioned growth medium . The growth medium was supplemented with 4 μM AraC to inhibit glial proliferation . In some experiments , OGB1 - AM was loaded into cells by incubating neurons in 1 mL of 2 μM OGB1 - AM ( Invitrogen ) for 30 min and rinsing 3 times with imaging buffer ( 145 mM NaCl , 2 . 5 mM KCl , 10 mM glucose , 10 mM HEPES pH 7 . 4 , 2 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM MgCl 2 ) . Neurons were stimulated in imaging buffer containing a drug cocktail to inhibit synaptic receptors ( 10 μM CNQX , 10 μM ( R ) - CPP , 10 μM gabazine , 1 mM ( S ) - MCPG , Tocris ) . Under these conditions , intracellular calcium increases are presumably caused by the opening of voltage sensitive calcium channels . Action potentials ( APs ) ( 83 Hz ) were evoked by field stimulation with a Grass Technologies S48 stimulation unit and a custom - built 24 - well cap stimulator with pairs of parallel platinum wires . The microscope was an Olympus IX81 with a 10× ( 0 . 4 NA ) air objective lens and EMCCD camera ( Andor 897 , 512 × 512 pixels , 35 frames / s ) , Cairn OptoLED illumination system , and GFP ( Excitation : 450 - 490 nm ; Dichroic : 495 nm long - pass ; Emission : 500 - 550 nm ) and TxRed ( Excitation : 540 - 580 nm ; Dichroic : 585 nm long - pass ; Emission : 593 - 668 nm ) filter sets . The field of view was 800 μm × 800 μm . Images were background subtracted ( mean of 5 % lowest pixel values ) . Responses were quantified for each cell as change in fluorescence divided by baseline fluorescence measured one second prior to stimulation . Signal - to - noise ratio ( SNR ) was quantified as peak ΔF / F 0 response over the standard deviation of the signal during a one second period prior to stimulation . Control experiments varying stimulation voltage , frequency , and pulse width insured suprathreshold stimulation of neurons . Voltage imaging using the ArchWT - GFP archaerhodopsin - based voltage sensor 54 confirmed that individual pulses ( 1 ms , 40 V , 83 Chen et al . Page 7 Nature .

The imaging and stimulation system was controlled by custom scripts written in MetaMorph software ( version 7 . 7 . 5 , Molecular Devices ) and Ephus software 55 ( ephus . org ) . Detailed neuronal culture screening methods will be described elsewhere ( T . J . W . , T . W . C . , E . R . S . , R . A . K . , V . J . , L . L . L . , K . S . , and D . S . K . , manuscript in preparation ) . Labeling V1 neurons Constructs used to produce AAV included pGP - AAV - syn - GCaMP - WPRE and the Cre recombinase - activated construct pGP - AAV - syn - flex - GCaMP - WPRE . Virus was injected slowly ( 30 nL in 5 minutes ) at a depth of 250 μm into the primary visual cortex ( two sites , 2 . 5 and 2 . 9 mm lateral from the lambda suture ) . For population imaging and electrophysiology ( Fig 2 - 3 ) , AAV2 / 1 - syn - GCaMP - WPRE virus ( titer : ∼ 10 11 - 10 12 genomes / mL ) was injected into the visual cortex of C57BL / 6J mice ( 1 . 5 - 2 months old ) 6 . For dendritic imaging ( Fig 4 , 5 and 6a - f ) , sparse labeling was achieved by injecting a mixture of diluted AAV2 / 1 - syn - Cre particles ( titer : ∼ 10 12 genomes / mL , diluted 8000 - 20 , 000 fold in PBS ) and high titer , Cre - dependent GCaMP6s virus ( ∼ 8×10 11 genomes / mL ) . This produces strong GCaMP6 expression in a small subset of neurons ( ∼ 3 - 5 cells in a 250 μm × 250 μm × 250 μm volume ) , defined by Cre expression 56 . Both pyramidal ( Fig . 4 - 5 ) and GABAergic ( Fig . 6 ) neurons were labeled using this approach , but they could be distinguished based on the presence or absence of dendritic spines . Post hoc immunolabeling further identified the imaged cells . For specific labeling of parvalbumin interneurons ( Fig . 6g and Supplementary Fig . 12 ) , Cre - dependent GCaMP6s AAV was injected into the visual cortex of PV - IRES - Cre mice 57 . Individual somata ( Supplementary Fig . 12 ) and dendritic segments could be recognized ( Fig . 6 g , h , total length of imaged dendrite : 2 . 86 mm ) , but the high labeling density made it difficult to track individual dendrites over long distances . Window surgery After 2 - 4 weeks of expression , mice were anesthetized using isoflurane ( 3 % for induction , 1 . 5 - 2 % during surgery ) and a circular craniotomy ( 2 - 3 mm diameter ) was made above V1 ( centered 2 . 7 mm lateral from the lambda suture ) . For acute experiments , the craniotomy was covered with agarose ( 1 - 1 . 3 % ) , and a round glass coverslip ( Warner Instruments ; 5mm diameter ; # 1 thickness ) was cemented to the skull to reduce motion of the exposed brain . A custom titanium head post was fixed to the skull using black dental cement ( Contemporary Ortho - Jet ) . For simultaneous imaging and cell - attached recording , the exposed brain was covered with ∼ 1 mm thick agarose ( 1 . 3 % ) without a coverslip . For chronic imaging experiments , the imaging window was constructed from two layers of microscope coverglass 6 . A larger piece ( Fisher , # 1 thickness ) was attached to the bone and a smaller insert ( # 2 thickness ) was fitted snugly into the craniotomy . Imaging experiments were started ∼ 1 - 2 weeks after chronic window implantation . Visual stimuli Moving grating stimuli were generated using the Psychophysics Toolbox 58 , 59 in MATLAB . Each stimulus trial consisted of a 4 s blank period ( uniform gray at mean luminance ) followed by a 4 s drifting sinusoidal grating ( 0 . 05 cycles per degree , 1 Hz temporal Chen et al .

Typically , 8 drifting directions were used ( separated by 45 degrees ) and 5 trials were recorded for each direction , giving a total of 40 stimulus trials per recording session ( 320 s recording time ) . The gratings were presented with an LCD monitor ( 30 × 40 cm ) , placed 25 cm in front of the center of the right eye of the mouse . The monitor subtended an angle of ±38° horizontally and - 20° to + 38° vertically around the eye of the mouse . For experiments with cell - attached recording ( Fig . 3 ) , pipette access required the use of a smaller LCD monitor ( 12 × 16 cm ) placed ∼ 10 cm in front of the right eye . During simultaneous imaging and electrophysiology , the optimal grating stimulus was repeatedly played ( duration 2 s , separated by a 4 s blank period ) , but the contrast of the stimulus grating was adjusted online to maintain moderate spike rates . For analysis of dendritic spine populations ( Fig . 5 ) , the stimulus contrast was lowered to reduce action potential - related dendritic signals ( average ΔF / F 0 in dendritic shafts at the preferred orientations was 32 % , 80 % . 16 % , 15 % , 12 % for cells 1 through 5 , corresponding to stimulus contrast 10 - 40 % , 5 - 20 % , 10 - 40 % , 20 - 40 % , 20 - 40 % ) . The orientation preference of dendritic shafts was identical to the soma , consistent with back - propagating action potentials ( data not shown ) . Orientation tuning of GABAergic dendrites ( Fig . 6 ) was mapped using the standard stimulus set at full contrast . The stimulus duration was 2 s ; because of the slower decay of calcium transients 41 we used a 6 s inter trial interval . Imaging mouse V1 neurons and dendrites Mice were placed on a warm blanket ( 37°C ) and kept anesthetized with 0 . 5 % isoflurane and sedated with chlorprothixene ( 20 - 40 μL at 0 . 33 mg / ml , i . m . ) 30 . Imaging was performed using a custom - built two - photon microscope ( designs available at research . janelia . org / Svoboda ) equipped with a resonant galvo scanning module ( Thorlabs ) , controlled by ScanImage ( scanimage . org ) 60 . The light source was a Mai Tai femtosecond pulsed laser ( Spectra - Physics ) running at 940 nm . The objective was a 16× water immersion lens ( Nikon , 0 . 8 NA , 3 mm working distance ) . The power used was 35 - 50 mW for full field imaging ( Fig . 2 ) and 20 - 40 mW for higher zoom imaging ( Fig . 3 - 6 ) . Images were collected at 15 Hz ( 512 × 512 pixels , 250 μm × 250 μm ; Fig . 2 ) or 60 Hz ( 256 × 256 pixels , 30 μm × 30 μm ; Fig . 3 ) , or 15 Hz ( 512 × 512 pixels , 30 μm × 30 μm ; Fig . 4 - 5 ) , or 15 Hz ( 512 × 512 pixels , 30 μm × 30 μm - 100 μm × 100 μm ; Fig . 6 ) . For dendritic imaging experiments ( Fig . 4 - 6 ) , fields of view were chosen so that extended dendritic segments were in one focal plane . At the end of each imaging session , z - stacks ( 1 μm step size ) of the recorded cells were acquired . The coordinates of the imaged dendrites relative to the parent somata were recorded . The orientation , curvature , and the branching pattern of the dendrites together with the constellation of spines , helped to precisely identify the same field of view in long - term imaging experiments . Electrophysiology In vivo cell - attached recordings were performed using glass pipettes ( ∼ 5 - 7 M Ω ) filled with solution containing the following ( in mM ) : 125 NaCl , 5 KCl , 10 glucose , 10 HEPES , 2 CaCl 2 , 2 MgSO 4 , and 0 . 1 Alexa Fluor 594 ; pH 7 . 4 ) . Signals were amplified using an AxoPatch 200B amplifier ( Molecular Devices ) , filtered at 5 kHz , and digitized at 10 kHz . Chen et al . Page 9 Nature .

HH M I A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t HH M I A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t HH M I A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t Spikes were recorded using current clamp mode . The frame trigger pulses of ScanImage 4 . 0 were also recorded and used offline to synchronize individual frames to electrophysiological recordings . After establishment of a low - resistance seal ( 15 - 50 M Ω ) , the orientation , spatial and temporal frequency of the stimuli was quickly optimized for individual neurons using recorded spikes . The optimal grating stimulus was repeated at a reduced contrast to maintain a moderate spiking rate . Image analysis Mechanical drift in the imaging plane was corrected using the TurboReg plug - in in ImageJ 61 . All remaining analyses were performed in MATLAB . Regions - of - interest ( ROIs ) corresponding to visually identifiable cell bodies were selected using a semi - automated algorithm ( Supplementary Fig . 14 ) . For GCaMP , ring - shaped ROIs were placed at the cytosolic regions of the cells ( excluding the nucleus ; GCaMP expression is typically restricted to the cytoplasm 11 ) . For OGB1 - AM , circular ROIs covering the whole soma were used . For long - term GCaMP imaging , baseline fluorescence images of multiple sessions were inspected manually , and only the cells that could be clearly identified in all imaged sessions were included in the analysis . The fluorescence time course of each cell was measured by averaging all pixels within the ROI , with a correction for neuropil contamination 41 . The fluorescence signal of a cell body was estimated as F cell _ true ( t ) = F cell _ measured ( t ) - r * F neuropil ( t ) , with r = 0 . 7 . The neuropil signal F neuropil ( t ) surrounding each cell was measured by averaging the signal of all pixels within a 20 μm region from the cell center ( excluding all selected cells ) . Cell - attached recordings confirmed that neuropil - compensated fluorescence changes reflect action potentials in single neurons ( Supplementary Fig . 15 ) . To ensure robust neuropil subtraction , only cells that were at least 3 % brighter than the surrounding neuropil were included . The neuropil correction was not applied for dendritic imaging experiments because sparse labeling provided negligibly low background . ΔF / F 0 was calculated as ( F - F 0 ) / F 0 , where F 0 is the baseline fluorescence signal averaged over a 2 second period immediately before the start of visual stimulation . Visual responses were measured for each trial as ΔF / F 0 , averaged over the stimulus period . Visually responsive neurons were defined as cells with significant stimulus - related fluorescence changes ( ANOVA across blank and eight direction periods , p < 0 . 01 ) 5 with an average ΔF / F 0 at preferred orientations greater than 6 % . The orientation selectivity index ( OSI ) was calculated for visually responsive cells 16 , 30 . First , the preferred orientation ( θ pref ) of the cell was determined as the stimulus that produced the strongest response . The orientation tuning curve was constructed by measuring the mean ΔF / F 0 , averaged over the stimulus period , for each orientation . We then fitted the tuning curve with the sum of two Gaussians centered on θ pref and θ pref + π , both with width σ ( constrained to > 15° ) , amplitudes A1 and A2 , and a constant baseline B . The OSI was defined as OSI = ( R pref - R ortho ) / ( R pref + R ortho ) , where R pref and R ortho are the response amplitudes at the preferred ( θ pref ) and the orthogonal orientation ( θ pref + π / 2 ) respectively . For simultaneous imaging and cell - attached recording , ring - shaped ROIs were placed over the cytosolic regions of the cells . Fluorescence transients at the soma were caused by action potentials , with little contribution from subthreshold activity 62 ( Supplementary Fig . 15 ) . To Chen et al . Page 10 Nature .

HH M I A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t HH M I A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t HH M I A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t quantify the efficiency for detecting single APs ( Fig . 3 ) , we identified single AP events with nearby APs at least 1 s away . Fluorescence traces consisting of 10 frames ( 0 . 17 s ) before and 60 frames ( 1 s ) after the i th 1 AP event were assembled in 70 - dimensional vectors , f i . Segments of noisy traces , n i were taken from periods without APs . The average of all 1 AP traces was used as a template vector , f template = Σ i f i / N . The vector was normalized after subtraction of the mean to create a unit vector f ̂ template . The projection of f i or n i along the direction of f ̂ template was calculated to obtain a scalar f i or n i , respectively . The AP detection threshold was defined as the 99 th percentile of all n i values ( i . e . , 1 % false positive ) , and the percentage of the f i values above the detection threshold was the AP detection efficiency . For spine images ( Fig . 4 - 5 ) , circular ROIs were placed over individual dendritic spines to measure spine fluorescence and compute ΔF / F 0 _ spine . To minimize contamination from back - propagating action potentials ( BAPs ) , we either recorded from ‘silent cells’ ( ∼ 40 % of cells ) showing few or no APs in response to a standard set of grating stimuli ( Fig . 4 ) , or used stimuli with reduced stimulus contrast ( Fig . 5 ) . Occasional BAP related calcium signals that invaded the imaged spines were removed using a subtraction method , implemented in three steps ( Supplementary Fig . 11 ) . First , a region covering the entire parent dendritic shaft ( ∼ 30 micrometers of dendritic length ; excluding all spines ) was drawn for each recorded dendritic segment to estimate BAP related global dendritic signal , ΔF / F 0 _ dendrite . Because of the much larger volume of the dendritic shaft compared to tuned dendritic spines ( 100 - fold ) , spines above and below the focal plane were expected to contribute negligible signal to ΔF / F 0 _ dendrite . This was verified using principle component analysis ( data not shown ) . Plotting ΔF / F 0 _ spine against ΔF / F 0 _ dendrite reveals two components of spine signals , a BAP - related component and a spine - specific component . Second , the BAP - related component was removed from the spine signals by subtracting a scaled version of the dendritic shaft signal , ΔF / F 0 _ spine _ specific = ΔF / F 0 _ spine - α ·ΔF / F 0 _ dendrite . α was determined using robust regression ( MATLAB function ‘robustfit . m’ ) of ΔF / F 0 _ spine vs . ΔF / F 0 _ dendrite ( the slope of the fitted line in Supplementary Fig . 11b ) . Third , the visual responsiveness ( ΔF / F 0 > 10 % ) and the OSI of individual spines were calculated with the BAP signal removed . Active spines ( Fig . 4f ) were defined as spines showing at least three spine - specific ( i . e . , BAP independent ) calcium events during the 5 minute imaging session , with an event defined as an episode of the calcium signal that crosses 3 s . d . of the baseline noise for at least three consecutive frames ( ∼ 50 ms ) . We next confirmed the effectiveness of the BAP removal algorithm . First , BAP removed spine signals showed sharp orientation tuning ( OSI = 0 . 84 ± 0 . 14 , mean ± s . d . , n = 190 spines ) comparable to V1 excitatory neurons ( Supplementary Fig . 9 , p > > 0 . 05 , Wilcoxon rank sum ) . This holds even for spines preferring the orthogonal orientation compared to the soma ( OSI = 0 . 82 ± 0 . 16 , n = 24 spines ) , indicating that the BAP contamination was cleanly removed . Second , the majority ( 79 . 7 % ) of visually responsive spines showed little trial - to - trial correlation with the dendritic shaft signal after BAP subtraction . 20 . 3 % spines still displayed significant correlation with shaft responses compared to trial shuffled controls ( p < 0 . 01 ) . This could reflect synchronously active pre - synaptic cells , or imperfect BAP action potential signal subtraction . Because we were unable to distinguish between these possibilities , these spines were excluded from further analysis . In two cells ( cell 4 and cell 5 ; Chen et al . Page 11 Nature . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2014 January 18 . HH M I A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t HH M I A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t HH M I A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t Fig . 5 ) , we collected larger numbers of trials ( 15 trials per orientation ) , which made it possible to further exclude trials with detectable dendritic responses ( ΔF / F 0 > 6 % ) . The result ( i . e . , the preferred orientation of the summed spine responses ) was identical as with using the subtraction procedure alone . For the analysis of GABAergic cells ( Fig . 6 ) , dendrites were traced using ‘Simple neurite tracer’ in ImageJ 63 . The program outputs a 1D sequence of coordinates traversing a dendrite and a 2D mask covering the traced dendrite , which were used to define ROIs along the dendrite ( size , 1 . 5 μm of dendritic length ; spacing , 1 μm ) . Visual responsiveness and orientation selectivity index were computed for individual ROIs . A region of dendrite is considered orientation selective if its response to least one stimulus orientation is significantly different from other orientations ( p < 0 . 01 , ANOVA across 8 conditions ) . Because synaptic and BAP signals were intermixed in the same dendritic compartment , no attempt was made to isolate synaptic signals from BAP - related components . We did not analyze the relationship between integrated synaptic signals and the output tuning in GABAergic cells . Reagent distribution DNA constructs and AAV particles with GCaMP6 variants were deposited for distribution at Addgene ( www . addgene . org ) and the University of Pennsylvania Vector Core ( www . med . upenn . edu / gtp / vectorcore ) and the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center ( flystocks . bio . indiana . edu ) , respectively .
