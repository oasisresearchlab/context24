INTRODUCTION The majority of reported tracer - diffusion experiments of spherical particles in rod networks focus on proteins in sus - pensions of F - actin , 1 – 10 which are relevant for mass transport in cells . Recently , experiments on tracer diffusion of spheres in host suspensions of slender particles , other than F - actin , have been reported : nucleosome core particles in dispersions of DNA , 11 colloidal spheres in solutions of “living polymers , ” 12 and colloidal spheres in dispersions of xanthan . 13 “Histone tails” fold out of the nucleosome par - ticles at a certain ionic strength and adsorb to DNA , which gives rise to anomalous stretched exponential diffusive behavior . 11 The living polymers of Ref . 12 consist of self - associating monomers bis (cid:1) ethylhexylureido (cid:2) toluene (cid:1) EHUT (cid:2) . Both the polymerization / depolymerization kinetics and the length distribution of EHUT probably have a strong inﬂu - ence on the diffusive properties of the tracer spheres . The xanthan host dispersions in Ref . 13 , where short - time trans - lational and rotational diffusion coefﬁcients of a tracer sphere are measured , can be regarded as a polymer network . The host networks in the above - mentioned references exhibit a quite complicated dynamics by themselves . As far as we know , there are no experimental data available on tracer diffusion of colloidal spheres in the much more simple networks consisting of relatively stiff , very long , and thin rods , aside from two earlier papers of the present authors . 14 , 15 In these two papers and in the present study we use fd virus as a rodlike colloidal host particle , which is indeed a very long and thin , rather stiff , rod and does not exhibit polymerization / depolymerization nor possible bundle forma - tion (cid:1) like F - actin , wormlike micelles and EHUT (cid:2) . Moreover , due to the very small van der Waals attractions between the fd - virus particles , the rod networks are stable over a wide range of salt concentrations , which offers the possibility to study diffusion in these networks as a function of the range of electrostatic interactions . The experiments in Refs . 14 and 15 were all done at relatively high salt concentrations , lead - ing to essentially hard - core interactions between the tracer sphere and the rods . Fd - virus suspensions have been recognized before as very good model systems for monodisperse rod dispersions in connection to (cid:1) micro - (cid:2) rhelogy 16 – 19 and phase transitions (cid:1) sometimes as binary mixtures with spherical colloids or polymers (cid:2) . 20 – 23 Reviews of the phase behavior of fd - virus suspensions can be found in Refs . 24 – 26 . There are a few (cid:1) semi - (cid:2) phenomenological theories on translational diffusion of tracer spheres through networks . 27 – 31 In Refs . 14 and 15 of the present authors , an attempt has been made to develop a microscopic theory for tracer diffusion of spheres through relatively simple net - a (cid:2) Present address : Laboratory for Neutron Scattering , ETH Zurich and Paul Scherrer Institute , CH - 5232 Villigen , PSI , Switzerland .

There are fundamentally different mechanisms leading to the slowing down of diffusion of a tracer sphere due to the presence of a rod network , depending on whether the tracer sphere is large or small in comparison to the mesh size of the network . For large tracer spheres , the translational motion of the tracer sphere is only possible when the network structure is severely distorted . In this case , direct interactions between the sphere and the rods are much more pronounced than hydrodynamic interactions . Tracer diffusion can then be de - scribed with the neglect of hydrodynamic interactions . 14 For small tracer spheres , where the sphere can move through the voids of the network without distorting the structure of the network , hydrodynamic interactions are important (cid:3) see Fig . 1 (cid:1) a (cid:2)(cid:4) . Due to the entanglement of the rods in the network , hydrodynamic interactions between the tracer sphere and the rods are screened . This screening is characterized by the so - called hydrodynamic screening length , which measures the penetration depth of shear waves into the network . For the rod networks considered here , there is no theory available yet for the hydrodynamic screening length . Despite the fact that the network structure remains essentially unchanged during the diffusive motion of such a small sphere , there is never - theless a distortion of the pair - correlation function between the sphere and the rods . This distortion is due to the fact that when the sphere moves past a rod , the probability to ﬁnd the sphere on the side of approach of the rod is larger than that on the “shadow side” of the rod , as depicted in Fig . 1 (cid:1) b (cid:2) . The rod - sphere pair - correlation function is therefore distorted , giving rise to a force on the sphere that affects its diffusive motion . We referred to the distortion of the pair - correlation function in Ref . 15 as “the shadowing effect . ” The shadow - ing contribution is determined not only by hard - core interac - tions , but also by charge interactions in case the rods and the sphere carry surface charges . The shadowing effect can thus be varied systematically by changing the electrostatic screen - ing length through variation of the ionic strength of the rod suspensions . In the present paper we investigate long - time transla - tional tracer diffusion of a charged tracer sphere in networks of charged rods at various ionic strengths . The theory on the effect of hydrodynamic interactions , as well as direct inter - actions , including charge interactions , is described in Sec . II . This is an extension of the theory developed in Ref . 15 to include charge - interaction contributions to the diffusion co - efﬁcient . The rather complicated expressions for the diffu - sion coefﬁcient are simpliﬁed in Sec . III where scaling rela - tions are derived . The use of these scaling relations greatly reduces the efforts involved in the data analysis . A summary of the relevant scaling relations which are used in our analy - sis of experimental data is given in Sec . IV . Section V is the experimental section . The colloidal systems are shortly de - scribed in Sec . V A . Carbon dioxide that dissolves from the air contributes signiﬁcantly to the ionic strength and the p H at low ionic strengths which , in turn , affects the surface charges of the rods (cid:1) fd - virus particles (cid:2) we used . This is dis - cussed in Sec . V B . The orientational order parameter plays an important role for tracer diffusion in nematic networks . The shadowing contribution depends explicitly on the order parameter , while the hydrodynamic contribution depends im - plicitly on the order parameter through the hydrodynamic screening length . The orientational order parameter as a function of rod concentration and ionic strength is presented in Sec . V C . The measured orientational order parameters are compared to data known from literature at relatively high ionic strengths . Section V D presents the data on long - time self - diffusion for various ionic strengths as functions of the rod concentration both in the isotropic and nematic phase . Section VI contains the data analysis , where the hydrody - namic screening length is calculated from our experimental diffusion coefﬁcients . A summary and conclusions are given in Sec . VII . II . THEORY In the long - time limit , on time scales much larger than the microstructural relaxation times of the rod network , the self - diffusion coefﬁcient D s is equal to D s = k B T (cid:1) p , (cid:1) 1 (cid:2) where k B is Boltzmann’s constant , T is the temperature , and (cid:1) p is the friction coefﬁcient of the tracer particle with the solvent and the rod network . This friction coefﬁcient is the proportionality constant between the external force F ext act - ing on the tracer sphere and its resulting thermally averaged velocity (cid:5) v p (cid:6) , F ext = (cid:1) p (cid:5) v p (cid:6) . (cid:1) 2 (cid:2) The friction coefﬁcient is affected by hydrodynamic interac - tions and direct interactions of the tracer particle with the rod network . The effect of screened hydrodynamic interactions is de - scribed in Ref . 15 and will be summarized in the following section . It will be shown that electrostatic interactions have negligible inﬂuence on the hydrodynamic - interaction contri - bution to the self - diffusion coefﬁcient once the rod concen - tration and the order parameter (cid:1) in the case of a nematic network (cid:2) are given . The shadowing effect , however , is strongly altered due to electrostatic interactions , which is considered in Sec . II B . FIG . 1 .

Hydrodynamic interactions When the tracer sphere moves through the solvent , it creates a ﬂuid ﬂow that will be reﬂected back to the sphere by the rods in the network . The sphere experiences an addi - tional friction due to this reﬂected ﬂow ﬁeld . This additional friction determines the effect of hydrodynamic interactions on the diffusion coefﬁcient . Due to the long - ranged nature of hydrodynamic interactions , the major contribution from re - ﬂected ﬂow originates from rods that are many mesh sizes away from the tracer sphere . Both the ﬂow from the sphere to a rod and that back to the sphere thus typically experience the presence of many intermediate rods (cid:3) see Fig . 1 (cid:1) a (cid:2)(cid:4) . As a result of entanglement of these rods , hydrodynamic interac - tion between the tracer sphere and a given rod in the network is screened by the rods that are in between the sphere and the given rod (cid:3) in black in Fig . 1 (cid:1) a (cid:2)(cid:4) . If the hydrodynamic screen - ing length is larger than the mesh size of the network , the intermediate network can be described as “an effective” me - dium on which a body force acts proportionally to the local ﬂuid ﬂow velocity . As shown in Ref . 15 , for a speciﬁed ve - locity of the tracer particle equal to (cid:5) v p (cid:6) , the external force required to maintain this velocity is equal to F ext = (cid:1) 0 (cid:7) I ˆ + (cid:8) j = 1 N (cid:5) M (cid:1) R j , u ˆ j (cid:2)(cid:6) (cid:9) · (cid:5) v p (cid:6) , (cid:1) 3 (cid:2) where (cid:1) 0 = 6 (cid:2)(cid:3) 0 a is the friction coefﬁcient of the tracer with the ﬂuid in the absence of the rods (cid:1) with (cid:3) 0 the shear vis - cosity of the ﬂuid and a the radius of the tracer sphere (cid:2) and I ˆ is the identity tensor .

Here , the subscript s stands for “screening . ” Furthermore , the functions G and H are equal to G (cid:1) (cid:4) D , (cid:4) L (cid:2) = (cid:10) (cid:1) 1 / 2 (cid:2) (cid:4) D (cid:1) 1 / 2 (cid:2) (cid:4) L dxh 1 (cid:1) x (cid:2) x , (cid:1) 6 (cid:2) H (cid:1) (cid:4) D , (cid:4) L (cid:2) = (cid:10) (cid:1) 1 / 2 (cid:2) (cid:4) D (cid:1) 1 / 2 (cid:2) (cid:4) L dxh 2 (cid:1) x (cid:2) x . The hydrodynamic screening length is a measure for the pen - etration depth of ﬂow into the rod network . So far , there is no independent theory which predicts the rod - concentration and orientational - order - parameter dependence of the hydrody - namic screening length (cid:4) −1 . For short distances or large hy - drodynamic screening lengths , h 1 (cid:1) x (cid:2) = 1 / 2 = h 2 (cid:1) x (cid:2) for x ↓ 0 , (cid:1) 7 (cid:2) in which case the screened Oseen tensor (cid:3) Eq . (cid:1) 5 (cid:2)(cid:4) reduces to the Oseen tensor for the creeping ﬂow equation in the ab - sence of body forces due to entanglement . The tensor M is proportional to the radius a of the tracer sphere because the additional friction force due to the re - ﬂected ﬂow ﬁeld is proportional to the size of the sphere . The assumption made in the derivation of the above re - sults is that ﬂow ﬁelds that are reﬂected by a rod to another rod back to the sphere are relatively weak and are neglected . For the open network under consideration here this is prob - ably a good approximation . For a nematic network of rods the screening length is , in principle , anisotropic . However , since the ﬂow induced by a sphere is stronger in the direction of motion of the sphere , it is assumed here that the most important contributions to hy - drodynamic interactions relate to the ﬂuid ﬂow in the direc - tion of motion of the tracer sphere , which is either parallel or perpendicular to the director of the nematic network . The validity of this assumption needs further theoretical work , where the Green’s function of the Debye - Büche - Brinkman equation with an anisotropic screening length should be computed . As far as we know , this has not been done yet . Since for the small tracer sphere considered here , for which the network structure is essentially unaffected by the presence of the sphere , the ensemble average in Eq . (cid:1) 3 (cid:2) can be taken with respect to the probability density function (cid:1) pdf (cid:2) of the degrees of freedom of a rod and the sphere that is not affected by the external force that acts on the tracer sphere . This leads to the following expression for the long - time self - diffusion coefﬁcient D sh , where only hydrodynamic interac - tions are accounted for (cid:1) as indicated by the superscript h (cid:2) : D s h D 0 = 1 1 + (cid:5) h (cid:6) , (cid:1) 8 (cid:2) where (cid:6) = (cid:1) (cid:2) / 4 (cid:2) D 2 L (cid:7) ¯ is the volume fraction of rods (cid:1) (cid:7) ¯ the number density of rods (cid:2) and the coefﬁcient (cid:5) h is given by (cid:5) h = 4 (cid:2) D 2 L v ˆ p · (cid:7) (cid:10) d R (cid:15) d u ˆ P 0 (cid:1) u ˆ (cid:16) S (cid:2) (cid:8) exp (cid:13) − (cid:9) V (cid:1) R , u ˆ (cid:2)(cid:14) M (cid:1) R , u ˆ (cid:2) (cid:9) · v ˆ p , (cid:1) 9 (cid:2) where v ˆ p = (cid:5) v p (cid:6) / (cid:16)(cid:5) v p (cid:6)(cid:16) is the unit vector along the ensemble averaged velocity of the tracer particle , P 0 (cid:1) u ˆ (cid:16) S (cid:2) is the pdf for the orientation u ˆ of a rod in the undistorted network (cid:1) as indicated by the subscript “0” (cid:2) , (cid:9) = 1 / k B T (cid:1) with k B Boltz - mann’s constant and T the temperature (cid:2) , and V (cid:1) R = r p 214501 - 3 Diffusion of spheres in networks of rods J .

Note that compared to Ref . 15 , the pdf P 0 (cid:1) u ˆ (cid:16) S (cid:2) for the orientation u ˆ of a rod is denoted here as a function of the scalar orientation order parameter S rather than the rod con - centration . In the above results it is assumed that the force on the tracer sphere is colinear with its average velocity . This is the case we consider in the experimental section , where diffu - sion in an isotropic network is considered , as well as diffu - sion in a nematic rod suspension either parallel or perpen - dicular to the nematic director . In Sec . III A we shall reduce the rather complicated form in Eq . (cid:1) 9 (cid:2) to a much simpler form by scaling arguments . B . The shadowing contribution As a sphere passes along a rod , the probability to ﬁnd a tracer sphere on the side of the rod from which the sphere approaches the rod is higher than on the other shadow side of the rod , as depicted in Fig . 1 (cid:1) b (cid:2) . This difference in probabil - ity , as quantiﬁed by the pair - correlation function , induces a force on the spheres that affects the diffusion coefﬁcient , which is referred to here as the shadowing effect . As dis - cussed in Ref . 15 , there are two different conﬁgurations of the rod relative to the external force acting on the tracer sphere that need to be considered : u ˆ (cid:17) F ext and u ˆ (cid:1) F ext . In the case where u ˆ (cid:17) F ext the distortion of the pair - correlation func - tion is very small as compared to the case where u ˆ (cid:1) F ext , provided the rods are very long and thin . We shall therefore only consider the case where u ˆ (cid:1) F ext . The distortion of the pair - correlation function for arbitrary orientations of the rod will then be constructed from this special case . For the very long and thin rods and the small diameter of the tracer sphere as compared to the length of the rods , end effects can be neglected . The rod is thus taken inﬁnitely long in the analysis given below . In the overdamped limit , where inertial forces can be neglected , the total force on the tracer sphere is zero . That is , the external force F ext , the force − (cid:3) V due to interaction with a rod (cid:1) with (cid:3) the gradient operator with respect to the posi - tion coordinate of the tracer sphere (cid:2) , the Brownian force − k B T (cid:3) ln g (cid:1) with g as the pair - correlation function (cid:2) , and the hydrodynamic force F h add up to zero , F ext − (cid:3) V − k B T (cid:3) ln g + F h = 0 . (cid:1) 10 (cid:2) The hydrodynamic force has been calculated in the previous section as F h = − (cid:1) h v p , (cid:1) h = 1 + (cid:5) h (cid:6) , (cid:1) 11 (cid:2) where v p is the translational velocity of the sphere and the coefﬁcient (cid:5) h is given in Eq . (cid:1) 9 (cid:2) . Using this expression for the hydrodynamic force amounts to the assumption that the tracer particle can be regarded as moving through an effec - tive ﬂuid with a friction coefﬁcient equal to (cid:1) h , which ac - counts for friction with the solvent , as well as hydrodynamic interactions with the rod network . From the force balance equation (cid:3) Eq . (cid:1) 10 (cid:2)(cid:4) it thus follows that v p = D sh (cid:3) (cid:9) F ext − (cid:9) (cid:3) V − (cid:3) ln g (cid:4) , where , as before , D sh = k B T / (cid:1) h is the diffusion co - efﬁcient where only hydrodynamics is accounted for . As it turns out , the self - diffusion coefﬁcient D s , where both hydro - dynamic interactions and shadowing are accounted for , can be written as D s D 0 = D s h D 0 D s s D 0 , (cid:1) 12 (cid:2) where D ss is the diffusion coefﬁcient related to the shadowing effect (cid:1) the superscript s stands for shadowing (cid:2) . The diffusion coefﬁcient where both hydrodynamic and direct interactions are accounted for follows from (cid:5) v p (cid:6) = D sh (cid:3) (cid:9) F ext − (cid:9) (cid:5) (cid:3) V (cid:6) − (cid:5) (cid:3) ln g (cid:6)(cid:4) . (cid:1) 13 (cid:2) When the distortion of the pair correlation is neglected , g is equal to g = exp (cid:13) − (cid:9) V (cid:14) so that Eq . (cid:1) 13 (cid:2) reduces to (cid:5) v p (cid:6) = D sh (cid:9) F ext , which implies that the diffusion coefﬁcient is equal to D sh , as it should . Including the shadowing effect accounts for the additional contribution to friction as a result of direct interactions of the tracer sphere with the rods . The ensemble average in Eq . (cid:1) 13 (cid:2) can be evaluated once g is known explicitly . The pair - correlation function can be obtained from the continuity equation (cid:4) g (cid:4) t = (cid:3) · (cid:1) v p g (cid:2) = D s h (cid:3) · (cid:3) (cid:9) g F ext − (cid:9) g (cid:3) V − (cid:3) g (cid:4) . (cid:1) 14 (cid:2) Neglecting end effects , the pair - correlation function is a function of the cylindrical coordinates (cid:10) and (cid:7) , as deﬁned in Fig . 2 . Since we are interested in the linear relationship be - tween the external force on the tracer sphere and the result - ing velocity , equations can be linearized with respect to F ext . The pair - correlation function is therefore written as (cid:3) with g 0 (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:2) = exp (cid:13) − (cid:9) V (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:2)(cid:14) as the undistorted pair - correlation func - tion (cid:4) g (cid:1) (cid:7) , (cid:10) (cid:2) = g 0 (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:2)(cid:3) 1 + cos (cid:13) (cid:10) (cid:14) L (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:2) F ext (cid:4) .

All equations in Ref . 15 remain valid , however , when (cid:14) is set equal to 1 . Since the shadowing effect for the case consid - ered in Ref . 15 is very small , this does not alter any of its conclusions . In the present case , in addition to hard - core interactions , interactions due to charges on the surfaces of the tracer sphere and the rod must be accounted for . For sufﬁciently small surface charges the interaction potential V Q between the tracer sphere and the rod is a superposition of Debye - Hückel interaction potentials , (cid:9) V Q (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:2) = K (cid:10) − (cid:12) (cid:12) dx exp (cid:13) − (cid:4) Q (cid:18) (cid:7) 2 + x 2 D 2 (cid:14) (cid:18) (cid:7) 2 + x 2 D 2 , (cid:1) 18 (cid:2) where the constant K is equal to K = Z c Z rod D L l B exp (cid:13) (cid:4) Q (cid:1) a + D / 2 (cid:2)(cid:14) (cid:1) 1 + (cid:4) Q a (cid:2)(cid:1) 1 + (cid:4) Q D / 2 (cid:2) , (cid:1) 19 (cid:2) where l B = (cid:9) e 2 / 4 (cid:2)(cid:13) is the Bjerrum length (cid:1) 0 . 71 nm for water at room temperature (cid:2) , with (cid:13) as the static dielectric constant of the solvent , e (cid:11) 0 the elementary charge , and Z c and Z rod the number of elementary charges on the surface of the tracer sphere and a rod , respectively (cid:1) including the sign of the charge (cid:2) . Furthermore , (cid:4) Q is the inverse Debye - Hückel elec - trostatic screening length , which is a function of number concentrations (cid:7) (cid:5) 0 of ion species (cid:5) that carry z (cid:5) elementary charges (cid:16) e (cid:16) , (cid:4) Q = (cid:18) e 2 k B T (cid:13) (cid:8) (cid:5) (cid:7) (cid:5) 0 z (cid:5) 2 . (cid:1) 20 (cid:2) The index Q on (cid:4) is used here to distinguish it from the hydrodynamic screening length (cid:4) −1 . The bulk number con - centrations (cid:7) (cid:5) 0 are the concentrations of ions in a reservoir that is in osmotic equilibrium with the suspension of rods . In the experiments , the fd - virus suspensions are always dia - lyzed for at least two days against an electrolyte solution with known ion concentrations (cid:7) (cid:5) 0 from which the electro - static screening length is calculated . The above expressions for the interaction potential are good approximations when typical potential energies of in - teraction V Q are at most a few times k B T . The differential equation (cid:3) Eq . (cid:1) 16 (cid:2)(cid:4) will be solved to leading order in charge - interaction energies , in line with the Debye - Hückel approxi - mation involved in Eqs . (cid:1) 18 (cid:2) and (cid:1) 19 (cid:2) . To this end L (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:2) is written as L (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:2) = L hc (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:2) + L Q (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:2) , (cid:1) 21 (cid:2) where L hc (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:2) is the hard - core contribution in Eq . (cid:1) 17 (cid:2) and L Q (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:2) is the contribution due to charge interactions . Products of L Q and V Q in Eq . (cid:1) 16 (cid:2) are neglected . Appendix A contains the mathematical details in obtaining the following “Debye - Hückel solution” of Eq . (cid:1) 16 (cid:2) : L Q (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:2) = − L hc (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:2) (cid:7) F c + (cid:9) (cid:10) a + D / 2 (cid:7) d (cid:7) (cid:1) L hc−1 (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:1) (cid:2) F (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:1) (cid:2) (cid:9) , (cid:1) 22 (cid:2) where F (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:1) (cid:2) = (cid:10) (cid:7) (cid:1) (cid:12) d (cid:7) (cid:2) dV Q (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:2) (cid:2) d (cid:7) (cid:2) (cid:7) (cid:9) − L hc (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:7) (cid:2) (cid:9) (cid:1) 23 (cid:2) and F c = F (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:1) = a + D / 2 (cid:2) is “the contact value” of F (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:1) (cid:2) . The ensemble averages in Eq . (cid:1) 13 (cid:2) can now be calcu - lated in terms of charge - interaction parameters . As shown in Appendix B , to leading order in the charge - interaction pa - rameters it is found that (cid:9) (cid:5) (cid:3) V (cid:6) = (cid:6)(cid:9) F ext (cid:19) 1 + 2 a D (cid:20) 2 (cid:8) (cid:11) 1 − (cid:10) a + D / 2 (cid:12) d (cid:7) dV Q (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:2) d (cid:7) (cid:7) (cid:9) − L hc (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:2) (cid:7) (cid:9) (cid:12) , (cid:1) 24 (cid:2) (cid:5) (cid:3) ln g (cid:6) = 0 , with (cid:6) = (cid:1) (cid:2) / 4 (cid:2) D 2 L (cid:7) ¯ as the volume fraction of rods . The above calculation complies to a rod with a ﬁxed orientation perpendicular to the direction of the external force . In the case of long and thin rods , the shadowing forces are much weaker for the motion of the sphere along the long axis of the rod and can be neglected . For arbitrary orienta - tions of a rod , only the component of the external force per - pendicular to the long axis of the rod needs to be considered . This component of the external force is equal to (cid:3) I ˆ − u ˆ u ˆ (cid:4) · F ext and replaces F ext in Eq . (cid:1) 24 (cid:2) . Ensemble averaging with respect to the orientation of the rod gives (cid:5)(cid:3) I ˆ − u ˆ u ˆ (cid:4)(cid:6) · F ext = 2 3 (cid:3) I ˆ − Q (cid:4) · F ext , (cid:1) 25 (cid:2) where I ˆ is the identity tensor and Q is the traceless orientational - order - parameter tensor , which is deﬁned as Q (cid:21) 3 2 (cid:5) u ˆ u ˆ − 1 3 I ˆ (cid:6) (cid:21) 3 2 (cid:15) d u ˆ P 0 (cid:1) u ˆ (cid:16) S (cid:2) (cid:3) u ˆ u ˆ − 1 3 I ˆ (cid:4) , (cid:1) 26 (cid:2) where , as before , P 0 (cid:1) u ˆ (cid:16) S (cid:2) is the probability density function for the orientation of a rod , which depends on the order parameter S (cid:1) also commonly denoted as P 2 (cid:2) .

The ensemble average of (cid:3) V in Eq . (cid:1) 24 (cid:2) thus generalizes for external forces with arbitrary orientation to (cid:9) (cid:5) (cid:3) V (cid:6) = (cid:6) 2 3 (cid:3) I ˆ − Q (cid:4) · (cid:9) F ext (cid:19) 1 + 2 a D (cid:20) 2 (cid:8) (cid:11) 1 − (cid:10) a + D / 2 (cid:12) d (cid:7) dV Q (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:2) d (cid:7) (cid:7) (cid:9) − L hc (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:2) (cid:7) (cid:9) (cid:12) . (cid:1) 27 (cid:2) For an isotropic suspension of rods , P 0 (cid:1) u ˆ (cid:2) = 1 / 4 (cid:2) , so that Q = 0 . For diffusion parallel to the nematic director , where F ext is parallel to the director , Q · F ext = S F ext , where S is the scalar orientational order parameter (cid:1) sometimes also denoted as P 2 (cid:2) . For diffusion perpendicular to the director , Q · F ext = − 1 2 S F ext . From Eq . (cid:1) 13 (cid:2) and Eqs . (cid:1) 1 (cid:2) and (cid:1) 2 (cid:2) it follows that the self - diffusion coefﬁcient , as far as the shadowing contribu - tion is concerned , can indeed be written in the form of Eq . (cid:1) 12 (cid:2) , with D ss D 0 = 1 − (cid:5) iso , (cid:17) , (cid:1) s (cid:6) , (cid:1) 28 (cid:2) where (cid:5) iso s = R , (cid:5) (cid:17) s = R (cid:1) 1 − S (cid:2) , (cid:1) 29 (cid:2) (cid:5) (cid:1) s = R (cid:1) 1 + 1 2 S (cid:2) , for diffusion in an isotropic network and a nematic network parallel and perpendicular to the director , respectively . Here , the function R follows from the explicit expressions derived above for the ensemble averages , R (cid:21) 2 3 (cid:19) 1 + 2 a D (cid:20) 2 (cid:11) 1 − (cid:10) a + D / 2 (cid:12) d (cid:7) dV Q (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:2) d (cid:7) (cid:7) (cid:9) − L hc (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:2) (cid:7) (cid:9) (cid:12) , (cid:1) 30 (cid:2) which is a function of the radius of the tracer sphere , the diameter of the rods , and the charge - interaction parameters ; that is , the charges on the tracer sphere and rods and the Debye screening length . Since direct interactions with just a single rod are independently added , this result is the ﬁrst term in an expansion with respect to the volume fraction . For long and thin rods , the volume fraction of interest is typically equal to D / L , which is indeed a small number . III . SCALING RELATIONS The hydrodynamic and shadowing contributions to the diffusion coefﬁcient as they stand in Eqs . (cid:1) 8 (cid:2) , (cid:1) 9 (cid:2) , and (cid:1) 28 (cid:2) – (cid:1) 30 (cid:2) , respectively , are complicated expressions which require quite some numerical efforts to evaluate explicitly . In this section we shall derive approximations for these complicated expressions by scaling to dimensionless groups and analyze the dependence of resulting expressions on these groups . A . Scaling of the hydrodynamic contribution The mean - ﬁeld concept of hydrodynamic screening is only meaningful when the hydrodynamic screening length (cid:4) −1 is larger than the mesh size of the network . In that case , the tracer sphere interacts hydrodynamically with many dif - ferent rods which are typically not in the immediate vicinity of the sphere . This implies that hydrodynamic forces are es - sentially unaffected by direct interactions between the tracer sphere and the rods . Mathematically , this can be seen from Eq . (cid:1) 9 (cid:2) for (cid:5) h as follows . For inﬁnite hydrodynamic screen - ing lengths , the integral in Eq . (cid:1) 9 (cid:2) diverges since in this limit the Oseen tensor T s (cid:1) R (cid:2) varies as (cid:22) 1 / R . Hence , for hydro - dynamic screening lengths that are much larger than the range of the pair - interaction potential , the numerical value for (cid:5) h is essentially determined by contributions from large distances , larger than the electrostatic screening length . The numerical value of (cid:5) h is thus essentially independent of the details of the pair - interaction potential . Since the mesh size of the network is larger than the diameter D of the rods , the above described mean - ﬁeld con - cept is only valid when (cid:4) D is a very small number . In that case , the functions G and H in Eq . (cid:1) 6 (cid:2) reduce to 1 2 ln (cid:13) (cid:4) D (cid:14) , provided (cid:4) L is not a very large number (cid:1) we will discuss this further in Appendix C (cid:2) . In that case the combination H / (cid:1) H + G (cid:2) in Eq . (cid:1) 4 (cid:2) for M is equal to 1 / 2 , and the function G in the prefactor to the integral renders a trivial prefactor (cid:22) ln (cid:13) (cid:4) D (cid:14) . Transforming the integration variables l and R in Eqs . (cid:1) 4 (cid:2) and (cid:1) 9 (cid:2) to the dimensionless variables (cid:4) l and (cid:4) R , respec - tively , and scaling the 1 / r dependence in Eq . (cid:1) 5 (cid:2) of the Oseen tensor to 1 / (cid:4) r then ﬁnally leads to a scaling relation of the form (cid:5) iso , (cid:17) , (cid:1) h = − (cid:4) a (cid:1) (cid:4) D (cid:2) 2 ln (cid:13) (cid:4) D (cid:14) (cid:15) iso , (cid:17) , (cid:1) h (cid:1) (cid:4) L (cid:2) . (cid:1) 31 (cid:2) The scaling function (cid:15) h is a well - behaved function of (cid:4) D and is essentially independent of this dimensionless group because (cid:4) D is a very small number (cid:1) see Appendix B for further details (cid:2) . Furthermore , (cid:15) h is essentially independent of the details of the pair - interaction potential as discussed above . Moreover , it turns out that (cid:15) h is a weak function of the order parameter S that enters explicitly through the ori - entational pdf in Eq . (cid:1) 9 (cid:2) (cid:1) this is also discussed in detail in Appendix C (cid:2) . Of course , there remains an orientational - order - parameter dependence implicitly through the hydrody - namic screening length . From a numerical evaluation of (cid:5) h , the scaling functions are calculated and plotted in Fig . 3 (cid:1) a (cid:2) . The following repre - sentations for the scaling functions are found (cid:1) with X = (cid:4) L (cid:2) : (cid:15) iso h (cid:1) X (cid:2) = 64 10 − 85 10 000 X − 33 10 000 X 2 , (cid:1) 32 (cid:2) (cid:15) (cid:17) h (cid:1) X (cid:2) = 53 10 − 95 1000 X + 3 10 000 X 2 , (cid:1) 33 (cid:2) 214501 - 6 Kang et al .

Redistribution subject to AIP license or copyright , see http : / / jcp . aip . org / jcp / copyright . jsp (cid:15) (cid:1) h (cid:1) X (cid:2) = 74 10 − 25 1000 X − 25 10 000 X 2 . (cid:1) 34 (cid:2) This representation is veriﬁed to be accurate to within about 5 % by a numerical evaluation of (cid:5) h from Eq . (cid:1) 9 (cid:2) in the range 1 (cid:16)(cid:4) L (cid:16) 20 . The above described approximations greatly simplify the analysis of experimental data and decouple hydrodynamic interactions from direct interactions . B . Scaling of the shadowing contribution Introducing the dimensionless distance (cid:7) ˜ = (cid:7) / (cid:1) a + D / 2 (cid:2) in Eq . (cid:1) 30 (cid:2) , substitution of Eqs . (cid:1) 18 (cid:2) and (cid:1) 19 (cid:2) for the interaction potential and a partial integration leads to R = 2 3 (cid:19) 1 + 2 a D (cid:20) 2 (cid:8) (cid:7) 1 + 2 l B L Z c Z rod (cid:3) 1 + (cid:4) Q a (cid:4)(cid:3) 1 + (cid:4) Q D / 2 (cid:4) (cid:15) s (cid:1) (cid:4) Q (cid:3) a + D / 2 (cid:4)(cid:2) (cid:9) , (cid:1) 35 (cid:2) where the scaling function (cid:15) s is given by (cid:1) the superscript s stands for shadowing (cid:2) (cid:15) s (cid:1) (cid:4) Q (cid:3) a + D / 2 (cid:4)(cid:2) = exp (cid:13) (cid:4) Q (cid:3) a + D / 2 (cid:4)(cid:14) (cid:10) 1 (cid:12) d (cid:7) ˜W Q (cid:1) (cid:7) ˜ (cid:2) / (cid:7) ˜ 3 , (cid:1) 36 (cid:2) where W Q is “a dimensionless interaction potential” equal to W Q (cid:1) (cid:7) ˜ (cid:2) = (cid:10) − (cid:12) (cid:12) dx˜ exp (cid:13) − (cid:4) Q (cid:3) a + D / 2 (cid:4) (cid:18) (cid:7) ˜ 2 + x˜ 2 (cid:14) (cid:18) (cid:7) ˜ 2 + x˜ 2 , (cid:1) 37 (cid:2) with x˜ = xD / (cid:1) a + D / 2 (cid:2) . As can be seen from these equations , the shadowing parameter R depends on the dimensionless groups Z c , Z rod , l B / L , (cid:4) Q a , and (cid:4) Q D . The dependence on the ﬁrst three dimensionless groups is trivial , just being present in the prefactor to (cid:15) Q in Eq . (cid:1) 35 (cid:2) . The nontrivial dependence on interaction parameters is through the dependence of (cid:15) Qs . As can be seen from Eqs . (cid:1) 36 (cid:2) and (cid:1) 37 (cid:2) , this scaling function depends on the dimensionless groups (cid:4) Q D and a / D only through the combination (cid:4) Q (cid:3) a + D / 2 (cid:4) . The scaling function (cid:15) Q (cid:1) X (cid:2) , with X = (cid:4) Q (cid:3) a + D / 2 (cid:4) is plotted in Fig . 3 (cid:1) b (cid:2) . The scal - ing function can be represented to within 1 % accuracy by the simple expression (cid:15) s (cid:1) X (cid:2) = 22 X 2 + 25 X + 10 , (cid:1) 38 (cid:2) within the relevant range where 0 . 4 (cid:16) X (cid:16) 20 . This represen - tation reduces the effort in the evaluation of the shadowing contribution to the diffusion coefﬁcient considerably . IV . WORKING EQUATIONS FOR DATA ANALYSIS : SUMMARY OF THE THEORY The following results from theory will be used to obtain the hydrodynamic screening length from experimental data for the long - time self - diffusion coefﬁcient . The concentration dependence of the diffusion coefﬁ - cient D s , relative to the Einstein diffusion coefﬁcient D 0 , is given by D s D 0 = 1 1 + (cid:5) iso (cid:17) , (cid:1) h (cid:6) 1 1 + (cid:5) iso , (cid:17) , (cid:1) s (cid:6) , (cid:1) 39 (cid:2) where (cid:6) is the hard - core volume fraction of rods , where the coefﬁcients (cid:5) iso , (cid:17) , (cid:1) h describe the effect of screened hydrody - namic interactions and the coefﬁcient (cid:5) iso , (cid:17) , (cid:1) s accounts for the shadowing effect ; that is , the effect of direct interactions . The indices “iso , ” (cid:17) , and (cid:1) refer to diffusion in the isotropic and nematic states , parallel and perpendicular to the nematic di - rector , respectively . In the shadowing contribution we wrote “by hand” the result in Eq . (cid:1) 28 (cid:2) in the form given in Eq . (cid:1) 39 (cid:2) . The difference between the two expressions is small since (cid:5) s (cid:6) is small . The higher order terms present in the above expression might account in approximation for interactions with more than a single rod simultaneously . These higher order direct interactions need further investigation . The hydrodynamic coefﬁcients are equal to (cid:5) iso h = − (cid:4) a (cid:1) (cid:4) D (cid:2) 2 ln (cid:13) (cid:4) D (cid:14) (cid:7) 64 10 − 85 10 000 (cid:4) L − 33 10 000 (cid:1) (cid:4) L (cid:2) 2 (cid:9) , (cid:1) 40 (cid:2) (cid:5) (cid:17) h = − (cid:4) a (cid:1) (cid:4) D (cid:2) 2 ln (cid:13) (cid:4) D (cid:14) (cid:7) 53 10 − 95 1000 (cid:4) L + 3 10 000 (cid:1) (cid:4) L (cid:2) 2 (cid:9) , (cid:1) 41 (cid:2) (cid:5) (cid:1) h = − (cid:4) a (cid:1) (cid:4) D (cid:2) 2 ln (cid:13) (cid:4) D (cid:14) (cid:7) 74 10 − 25 1000 (cid:4) L − 25 10 000 (cid:1) (cid:4) L (cid:2) 2 (cid:9) . (cid:1) 42 (cid:2) These coefﬁcients are functions of the dimensionless groups (cid:4) a , (cid:4) D , and (cid:4) L , where (cid:4) −1 is the hydrodynamic screening length , a is the radius of the tracer sphere , D is the diameter of a rod , and L is its length . The shadowing coefﬁcients are equal to (cid:5) iso s = R , (cid:5) (cid:17) s = R (cid:1) 1 − S (cid:2) , (cid:1) 43 (cid:2) (cid:5) (cid:1) s = R (cid:1) 1 + 1 2 S (cid:2) , where S is the orientational order parameter (cid:1) also denoted as P 2 (cid:2) and R is given by FIG . 3 .

This coefﬁcient is a function of the dimensionless groups (cid:4) Q a , (cid:4) Q D , l B / L , Z c , and Z rod . The above expressions will be used in the following ex - perimental part to obtain the hydrodynamic screening length from experimental data for the diffusion coefﬁcient . V . EXPERIMENT In the following section the system of rigid rods (cid:1) fd - virus particles (cid:2) and the tracer sphere (cid:1) apoferritin (cid:2) is intro - duced . In Sec . V B , the ionic strength and p H of suspensions , and the surface charge of fd - virus particles and apoferritin are discussed . We always prepared our system through an osmotic equilibrium with a Tris / HCl buffer of varying ana - lytical concentration . The ionic strength of these osmotic res - ervoirs is the ionic strength from which the electrostatic Debye - Hückel screening length is calculated . The p H of these osmotic reservoirs is also the p H of the suspensions . This p H is affected by carbon dioxide that dissolves from the air when the analytical buffer concentration is smaller than about 10 mM . Section V B therefore contains a calculation of the p H as a function of the buffer concentration where dissolved carbon dioxide is taken into account . Since diffu - sion coefﬁcients in the nematic state depend on the orienta - tional order parameter , Sec . V C discusses data on the order parameter as a function of fd - particle concentration and ionic strength . Finally , in Sec . V D the diffusion data are pre - sented . In the next section , all the results presented in the present section will be combined to extract the hydrody - namic screening length . A . The colloidal systems Bacteriophage fd is a rodlike molecule with a contour length of L = 880 nm , a bare diameter of D = 6 . 6 nm , a per - sistence length at high salt concentration of P = 2200 nm , and a molecular weight of M = 1 . 64 (cid:8) 10 7 g / mol . The charge density of fd - virus particles is discussed in detail in Sec . V B . The fd virus was grown and puriﬁed following standard biological protocols , 32 using the XL1blue strain of E . coli as the host bacteria . The virus particles were puriﬁed by re - peated centrifugation (cid:1) 10 5 g for 5 h (cid:2) and ﬁnally redispersed in Tris / HCl buffers with varying concentration , depending on the desired ionic strength . Apoferritin is a protein with a diameter of 12 . 8 nm , which is used here as a tracer sphere . The surface charge of apoferritin will be discussed in detail in Sec . V B . The dimensions that are needed as an input in order to calculate the hydrodynamic screening length from diffusion data are D = 6 . 6 nm , L = 880 nm , a = 6 . 4 nm . (cid:1) 45 (cid:2) The volume fraction (cid:6) of the fd virus can be related to the weight concentration c , using the linear dimensions in Eq . (cid:1) 45 (cid:2) and the molar mass 1 . 64 (cid:8) 10 7 g / mol , (cid:6) = 1 . 10 (cid:8) 10 −3 c (cid:3) mg / ml (cid:4) . (cid:1) 46 (cid:2) The numerical value of the weight concentration in this ex - pression should be expressed in mg / ml , as indicated . B . Ionic strength , p H , and surface charges As mentioned above , fd suspensions are dialyzed against a large reservoir of Tris / HCl buffer with a known analytical concentration of Tris and added HCl . The ionic strength that goes into the calculation of the Debye screening length is the ionic strength of the osmotic reservoir , being equal to the corresponding concentration in the dispersion outside the double layers . In order to calculate the Debye screening length , it is therefore sufﬁcient to consider the ionic strength of the osmotic reservoir , without the presence of fd - virus particles . Furthermore , the activity of H + ions will be the same in the reservoir and the fd suspension , so that also the p H of the fd suspensions will be the same as in the reservoir , despite the fact that relatively many H + ions are dissociated from the surface of the fd - virus particles . To prevent CO 2 from dissolving in our samples would require working under a nitrogen atmosphere , which is not feasible for both the ﬂuorescence correlation spectroscopy (cid:1) FCS (cid:2) and birefringence experiments . Exposure of low buffer - concentration samples for a few minutes to air was sufﬁcient to affect their p H . We therefore chose to equilibrate the suspensions and osmotic reservoirs with the surrounding air and to account for carbonic acid explicitly . For low ionic strengths (cid:1) below Tris / HCl buffer concentrations of 10 mM (cid:2) , the effect of dissolved CO 2 on ionic strength and p H cannot be neglected . Both the p H and the ionic strength are impor - tant for the analysis of diffusion data in terms of the hydro - dynamic screening length . The calculation of ionic strength and p H , where dis - solved CO 2 from the air is accounted for , is given in Appen - dix D . In this section we shall present the results of this calculation , together with experimental data which conﬁrm this calculation . The Tris / HCl buffers are prepared by adding a small volume of HCl with a concentration of 1 M to a 20 . 0 mM Tris solution till a p H of 8 . 2 is attained . This buffer is then diluted with de - ionized water for the preparation of the lower Tris / HCl - buffer concentrations . The analytical concentration c T of the Tris / HCl buffer is deﬁned as the total concentration of Tris : 20 mM for the original buffer and 20 mM divided by the dilution factor for the diluted buffers . The p H is plotted in Fig . 4 (cid:1) a (cid:2) against the analytical Tris / HCl buffer concentration c T . The solid line is the result of the calculations from Appendix D , including carbonic acid , which is in reasonable agreement with the measured p H . The dashed line is the theoretical p H without taking CO 2 into account . As can be seen , there is a signiﬁcant inﬂuence of the CO 2 that dissolves from the air for analytical buffer concen - trations lower than 10 mM . As is shown in Fig . 4 (cid:1) b (cid:2) , where 214501 - 8 Kang et al . J . Chem . Phys . 126 , 214501 (cid:2) 2007 (cid:1) Downloaded 21 Sep 2007 to 134 . 94 . 112 . 209 . Redistribution subject to AIP license or copyright , see http : / / jcp . aip . org / jcp / copyright . jsp I / c T is plotted against c T , the ionic strength is also signiﬁ - cantly affected by CO 2 for these lower buffer concentrations (cid:1) the dashed line is the prediction without CO 2 (cid:2) . This is im - portant for the calculation of the Debye screening length for the various Tris / HCl buffers . The data point (cid:2) in Fig . 4 (cid:1) a (cid:2) is the p H for the 0 . 16 mM dispersion with the 3 mg / ml fd virus after dialysis . The ma - jority of H + ions in the dispersion is due to the ions that are dissociated from the fd - virus particles and are for the larger fraction contained within the double layers . The p H of the dispersion , however , is the same as for the osmotic reservoir , as it should . The (cid:3) in Fig . 4 (cid:1) a (cid:2) is the p H for the 20 mM buffer solution with 100 mM NaCl added . As can be seen , adding salt does not affect the p H within experimental accu - racy . Zimmermann et al . 33 determined the charge of an fd vi - rus , where titration curves are interpreted on the basis of different models for an fd virus particle . The model , where it is assumed that only the hydrophilic outer region of adsorbed proteins and not the DNA strand of fd itself is in contact with solvent , explains experimental titration curves almost per - fectly (cid:1) except for p H (cid:17) 4 where the fd - virus particles are positively charged (cid:2) . From the data in Ref . 33 (cid:1) see Fig . 5 (cid:2) it is found that in the p H range 7 . 0 (cid:16) p H (cid:16) 8 . 2 of our experi - ments , the charge of an fd - virus particle varies in the range −10 000 (cid:16) Q fd (cid:16) −8500 . Although the buffer capacity of the low ionic strength Tris / HCl buffer against dissolving CO 2 from the air is not sufﬁcient to keep the p H at a value of 8 . 2 , the p H range is still within a range where the surface charge of the fd - virus particles does not vary too much . The inset in Fig . 5 shows the charge dependence on p H of fd over a larger range . Apoferritin has 624 negative and 576 positive disso - ciable groups . The isoelectric point is at p H = 4 . Gapinski et al . 34 analyzed experimental structural and dynamical data on apoferritin using the charge as an adjustable parameter . They found that around p H = 7 , the charge at very low apo - ferritin concentration varies from −5 to −10 elementary charges , depending on whether the charge is obtained from static or dynamic data . In Ref . 35 it is found from dynamic data that the charge is −3 for low apoferritin concentrations , increasing to about −10 at higher concentrations . Through the measurement of the second virial coefﬁcient , Petsev and co - workers 36 – 38 found a charge of −24 elementary charges at a p H of about 5 . Since the charge of apoferritin is not unam - biguously known , we shall use the charge in Sec . VI as a ﬁt parameter such that the hydrodynamic screening length for isotropic networks for the various buffer concentrations col - lapses onto a single master curve . As it turns out , the charge determined in this way is −3 elementary charges . C . Orientational order parameters The setup with which the orientational order parameter has been determined is sketched in Fig . 6 . The fd - virus sus - pension is aligned by means of a 2 T magnet with the mag - netic ﬁeld in the direction as indicated in Fig . 6 . The mag - netic ﬁeld determines the orientation of the director and renders a monodomain nematic throughout the sample vol - ume . A magnetic ﬁeld of 2 T is too weak to affect the order parameter 39 , 40 to within experimental error . The sample con - tainer is a quartz cuvette with a path length of 1 mm . Before FIG . 4 .

The experimental setup for the determination of the orientational order parameter . The nematic sample is made monodomain by means of a magnetic ﬁeld B . The incident polarized light is at 45° with the vertical direction (cid:1) polarizer P (cid:2) . After the sample a (cid:18) / 4 plate is oriented with one of its optical axis parallel with P . The transmitted intensity through the ana - lyzer A is minimized as a function of the angle (cid:5) . 214501 - 9 Diffusion of spheres in networks of rods J . Chem . Phys . 126 , 214501 (cid:2) 2007 (cid:1) Downloaded 21 Sep 2007 to 134 . 94 . 112 . 209 . Redistribution subject to AIP license or copyright , see http : / / jcp . aip . org / jcp / copyright . jsp a measurement , the suspension is centrifuged for 1 min at 1000 g to remove possibly present dust . The incident laser beam is linearly polarized with an angle of 45° with respect to the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld (cid:1) polarizer P in Fig . 6 (cid:2) . After the sample , there is a (cid:18) / 4 plate with one of its fast optical axis parallel to P . The transmitted intensity I depends on the angle (cid:5) of analyzer A as I = 1 2 I 0 (cid:3) 1 + sin (cid:13) 2 (cid:5) + (cid:19)(cid:20) (cid:14)(cid:4) , (cid:1) 47 (cid:2) where I 0 is the incident intensity and (cid:19)(cid:20) is the retardation induced by the sample . Minimizing the intensity as a func - tion of (cid:5) by rotating the analyzer A thus determines the retardation which , in turn , is equal to (cid:19)(cid:20) = 2 (cid:2) d (cid:18)(cid:19) n , (cid:1) 48 (cid:2) with d = 1 mm as the sample path length , (cid:18) = 633 nm the wavelength of the laser beam in vacuum , and (cid:19) n the differ - ence in refractive index along the principal axis of alignment of the fd - virus suspension . The orientational order parameter is equal to S = (cid:19) n / (cid:19) n max , (cid:1) 49 (cid:2) where (cid:19) n max is the difference in refractive index if the fd rods were perfectly aligned . Clearly , (cid:19) n max is proportional to the number concentration of rods . The saturation birefrin - gence has been determined from magnetic birefringence measurements in Ref . 41 to be equal to 6 . 00 (cid:8) 10 −5 c mg / ml . From scattering data , a different value was found in Ref . 23 , (cid:19) n max = (cid:3) 3 . 8 ± 0 . 3 (cid:4) (cid:8) 10 −5 c (cid:3) mg / ml (cid:4) . (cid:1) 50 (cid:2) We shall use this latter expression for (cid:19) n max since the earlier reported value in Ref . 41 turned out to give unphysical val - ues for the order parameter . Equations (cid:1) 48 (cid:2) – (cid:1) 50 (cid:2) are used to calculate S once (cid:19)(cid:20) is found by minimizing the intensity in Eq . (cid:1) 47 (cid:2) with respect to (cid:5) . The advantage of using a (cid:18) / 4 plate is that one can ﬁnd (cid:19)(cid:20) simply by minimizing the transmitted intensity . Without the (cid:18) / 4 plate , the transmitted intensity is equal to 1 2 I 0 (cid:3) 1 + sin (cid:13) 2 (cid:5) (cid:14) cos (cid:13) (cid:19)(cid:20) (cid:14)(cid:4) . The determination of the retardation (cid:19)(cid:20) in the absence of a (cid:18) / 4 plate thus requires a measurement of the incident intensity I 0 . The use of a (cid:18) / 4 plate signiﬁcantly increases the accuracy of the experimentally determined ori - entational order parameters . The orientational order parameter S is given in Fig . 7 as a function of the fd - virus concentration for the various ana - lytical Tris / HCl - buffer concentrations and the sample with added NaCl . For the lower Tris / HCl concentrations , a mag - netic ﬁeld of 2 T was not able to induce a nematic mon - odomain above a certain fd concentration , indicated by “ (cid:3) . ” For these higher fd concentrations at low ionic strengths , no measurements with the above described method could be performed . Below the concentration indicated by the vertical bar , the measured order parameter dropped sharply to a much lower value . This concentration is identiﬁed with the nematic - binodal concentration . The numerical values of the binodal concentrations obtained in this way are in accor - dance with those reported in Refs . 23 , 40 , and 42 . Figure 7 (cid:1) f (cid:2) gives the order parameter at the nematic - binodal concentra - tion as a function of ionic strength . As can be seen from this ﬁgure , our order parameters at the binodal concentration (cid:1) the (cid:1) ’s (cid:2) agree with those reported earlier in Refs . 23 and 42 . The order parameter at the lowest salt concentration and the higher fd concentrations in Fig . 7 (cid:1) a (cid:2) seems to asymptote to a value that is a little above unity . This is due either to about 1 % – 2 % error in concentration or to the error in the value for the saturation birefringence in Eq . (cid:1) 50 (cid:2) . Within the Onsager theory , the order parameter , as well as the binodal concentrations , scale as (cid:1) L / D (cid:2) (cid:6) (cid:22) DL 2 . Scal - ing for various salt concentrations could therefore be achieved by introducing an effective concentration as (cid:14) eff (cid:21)(cid:3)(cid:1) L / D (cid:2) (cid:6) (cid:4) eff = (cid:1) D eff / D (cid:2) (cid:14) , where (cid:14) is the bare value of (cid:3)(cid:1) L / D (cid:2) (cid:6) (cid:4) , and the effective diameter D eff is equal to FIG . 7 . The orientational order parameter S as a function of fd - virus con - centration for several Tris / HCl - buffer concentrations (cid:1) and added salt (cid:2) , as indicated in the ﬁgures . The points (cid:3) for the three lower salt concentrations indicate the concentration above which no monodomain could be obtained with the 2 T magnet . The solid curves are guides to the eye . The thick vertical line marks the upper binodal concentration . The lower right ﬁgure gives the value of the order parameter at the upper - binodal concentration as a function of ionic strength : (cid:1) are our data , (cid:4) and (cid:2) are data from Refs . 23 and 42 , as obtained by birefringence and scattering measurements , respectively . 214501 - 10 Kang et al . J . Chem . Phys . 126 , 214501 (cid:2) 2007 (cid:1) Downloaded 21 Sep 2007 to 134 . 94 . 112 . 209 . Redistribution subject to AIP license or copyright , see http : / / jcp . aip . org / jcp / copyright . jsp D eff = D (cid:7) 1 + (cid:21) (cid:4) Q D (cid:9) . (cid:1) 51 (cid:2) Here , the number (cid:21) can be varied to achieve scaling . How - ever , the fd - virus suspensions do not behave as Onsager sys - tems . It is not possible to ﬁnd a single value for (cid:21) such that the order parameters fall onto a master curve and at the same time have coinciding scaled binodal concentrations . Indeed , the order parameter at the binodal concentrations are differ - ent for the different ionic strengths (cid:3) see Fig . 7 (cid:1) f (cid:2)(cid:4) . Deviations from the Onsager theory have also been observed in terms of the relative width of the biphasic region . 20 Nevertheless , it turns out that our data for the order parameter can be scaled to within experimental error , as can be seen in Fig . 8 , with (cid:21) = 15 in Eq . (cid:1) 51 (cid:2) . The effective concentration (cid:14) eff is thus related to the bare fd concentration in mg / ml as (cid:14) eff = (cid:7) 1 + 15 (cid:4) Q D (cid:9) (cid:14) = (cid:7) 1 + 15 (cid:4) Q D (cid:9) 0 . 147 (cid:3) fd (cid:4) , (cid:1) 52 (cid:2) where we used Eqs . (cid:1) 45 (cid:2) and (cid:1) 46 (cid:2) . To within experimental error , the data can be ﬁtted with a single exponential function (cid:1) see the solid line in Fig . 8 (cid:2) . It is thus found that the fd - concentration dependence , as well as the salt - concentration dependence of the order parameter , can be described by the single scaling relation S = 0 . 98 − 0 . 75 exp (cid:11) − (cid:7) 1 + 15 (cid:4) Q D (cid:9) (cid:8) (cid:3) fd (cid:4) 80 (cid:12) , (cid:1) 53 (cid:2) where the fd concentration should be expressed in mg / ml . This experimental result is used in the data analysis in Sec . VI . It is not clear whether this scaling has any theoretical relevance . In the present paper , we shall use this scaling relation in our data analysis as a mere convenience in order to be able to calculate order parameters from the ionic strength and fd concentration . A discussion of the possible theoretical basis for the scaling relation (cid:1) 52 (cid:2) is beyond the scope of the present paper . A scaling of this sort has been discussed in Ref . 40 . Note that the effective value of (cid:1) L / D (cid:2) (cid:6) at the nematic - binodal concentration , for the highest ionic strength , is equal to 9 . 5 , which is about a factor of 2 higher than the Onsager prediction of 4 . 2 in the case of stiff rods . Also , the corresponding order parameter at the binodal con - centration is 0 . 65 as compared to 0 . 80 for stiff Onsager rods . The ﬂexibility of the fd - virus particles is probably the reason that our experimental data for the highest ionic strength do not agree with those for stiff Onsager rods . Indeed , the ex - perimental nematic - binodal concentration and order param - eter at that concentration found here are in semiquantitative accordance with theoretical predictions for ﬂexible hard - core rods with a chain ﬂexibility of L / P = 0 . 4 , where P = 2200 nm is the persistence length . 43 The Debye screening length for water at 25 °C is con - veniently calculated from Eq . (cid:1) 20 (cid:2) as (cid:4) Q −1 (cid:3) nm (cid:4) = 0 . 304 / (cid:18) I (cid:3) M (cid:4) . (cid:1) 54 (cid:2) For our experiments , (cid:4) Q D varies from 0 . 24 , to 0 . 46 , to 0 . 96 , to 2 . 06 , and to 7 . 17 with increasing ionic strength , so that the factor (cid:21) / (cid:4) Q D in Eq . (cid:1) 51 (cid:2) varies from 62 , to 33 , to 16 , to 7 . 3 , and to 2 . 1 , respectively . D . Diffusion coefﬁcients Tracer - diffusion constants of apoferritin in fd suspen - sions were measured with FCS . Since fd - virus particles ﬂuo - resce to some extent , the resulting contribution to the corre - lation function must be subtracted . How this is done is discussed in Ref . 15 . Also , the sample container and mon - odomain alignment of the nematic samples is discussed in that reference . That FCS measures long - time self - diffusion coefﬁcients for small tracer spheres has been shown in Ref . 14 . It is also shown in Ref . 15 that the long - time self - diffusion coefﬁcient is equal to Fick’s diffusion coefﬁcient for mass transport , provided that the network structure is not affected by the presence of the small tracer spheres . In Fig . 9 the measured diffusion coefﬁcients are plotted as a function of fd concentration for the various analytical Tris / HCl - buffer concentrations that are used (cid:1) c T = 0 . 16 , 0 . 80 , 4 . 00 , and 20 . 0 mM and c T = 20 . 0 mM plus 100 mM NaCl (cid:2) . The data for the highest ionic strength , where 100 mM NaCl is added , are taken from Ref . 15 . The gray vertical regions indicate the location of the isotropic - nematic coexistence re - gion . The same data , except for the highest ionic strength , are plotted in Fig . 10 as functions of fd concentration in the isotropic phase and in the nematic phase for diffusion per - pendicular and parallel to the nematic director . As can be seen , there is a strong effect of the ionic strength on the diffusive behavior of apoferritin . Note that the diffusion coefﬁcients just below the isotro - pic binodal is in between the coefﬁcients for parallel and perpendicular motion in the nematic state just above the iso - tropic binodal . As far as the shadowing effect is concerned , this is predicted by our theory (cid:3) see Sec . IV , Eq . (cid:1) 43 (cid:2) in par - ticular (cid:4) . This difference between the self - diffusion coefﬁ - cients for parallel and perpendicular motions is more pro - nounced for lyotropic rods (cid:1) see Ref . 44 (cid:2) , but of the same order as compared to thermotropic rods (cid:1) see Ref . 45 and references therein (cid:2) . VI . THE HYDRODYNAMIC SCREENING LENGTH The way to extract hydrodynamic screening lengths from the diffusion data is as follows . For a given fd concen - tration and salt concentration , the diffusion coefﬁcient is cal - culated from the expressions in Sec . IV . The hydrodynamic screening length is chosen such that the calculated diffusion FIG . 8 . Scaling of the order parameter with respect to an effective rod concentration (cid:14) eff = (cid:3)(cid:1) L / D (cid:2) (cid:6) (cid:4) eff with (cid:21) = 15 , as described in the text . The open symbols correspond to the same ﬁlled symbols in Fig . 7 for the various buffer concentrations : c T = 0 . 16 mM (cid:1) (cid:4) (cid:2) , 0 . 80 mM (cid:1) (cid:5) (cid:2) , 4 . 00 mM (cid:1) (cid:4) (cid:2) , 20 . 0 mM (cid:1) (cid:3) (cid:2) , and 20 mM + 100 mM NaCl (cid:1) (cid:5) (cid:2) . 214501 - 11 Diffusion of spheres in networks of rods J .

Redistribution subject to AIP license or copyright , see http : / / jcp . aip . org / jcp / copyright . jsp coefﬁcient matches the experimentally measured value (cid:1) the data in Figs . 9 and 10 (cid:2) . The p H and ionic strength needed for the calculation of the diffusion coefﬁcient are obtained for each analytical Tris / HCl - buffer concentration , as discussed in Sec . V B (cid:1) see Fig . 4 (cid:2) . The Debye screening length is then calculated according to Eq . (cid:1) 54 (cid:2) , and the charge of the fd - virus particles is obtained from Fig . 5 . In the case of nematic fd suspensions , the orientational order parameter for a given fd concentration and ionic strength is calculated from Eq . (cid:1) 53 (cid:2) . There are a few limitations on the validity of the theory developed above that exclude the use of some of the diffu - sion data for the calculation of the hydrodynamic screening length . Our analysis of the shadowing effect is limited to the case when the tracer sphere interacts with just one single rod , not with two or more rods simultaneously . This is only cor - rect when the mesh size of the fd network is about ten times larger than the Debye screening length (cid:4) Q −1 . Hence , we can only use diffusion data for which (cid:4) Q (cid:22)(cid:23) 10 . The mesh size can be calculated from (cid:22) = L (cid:18) c * / c , (cid:1) 55 (cid:2) where c * = 0 . 076 mg / ml is the fd - overlap concentration . For the same reason , our expression (cid:1) 28 (cid:2) for the shadowing ef - fect is the ﬁrst order term in an expansion with respect to the fd concentration . The combination (cid:5) iso , (cid:1) , (cid:17) s (cid:6) should therefore be less than about 1 / 2 . A third requirement is that the hydro - dynamic screening length is at least about two times larger than the mesh size ; that is , (cid:4)(cid:22)(cid:16) 1 / 2 . Data points that do not meet these requirements should not be included in the data analysis where our theory is applied . As mentioned in Sec . V B , the surface charge Z c of apo - ferritin is not precisely known . We therefore use Z c as a ﬁtting parameter , such that the data for the isotropic phase for all buffer concentrations collapse onto a single master curve . The best choice for Z c turns out to be Z c = −3 . This charge agrees with that reported in Ref . 35 for low apofer - ritin concentrations and is lower than the values reported in Refs . 34 and 36 – 38 , where charges varying from −5 to −24 have been found . The resulting master curve is given in Fig . 11 (cid:1) a (cid:2) , where the screening length is plotted in units of the rod length versus the fd concentration , and in Fig . 11 (cid:1) b (cid:2) , where the screening length is given in units of the mesh size of the network as a function of the mesh size . For the high buffer concentrations , the above - mentioned requirements for the validity of the theory are satisﬁed for most data points , while the hydrodynamic screening length is insensitive to the FIG . 9 . Long - time self - diffusion coefﬁcients of apofer - ritin in fd - virus particle suspensions as a function of fd concentration for various analytical Tris - buffer concen - trations , as indicated . The last ﬁgure is for a 20 . 0 mM Tris / HCl buffer with 100 mM added NaCl . These latter data are taken from Ref . 15 . The vertical gray regions indicate the location of the IN biphasic region . In the nematic phase , the upper and lower curves relate to diffusions parallel and perpendicular to the director , re - spectively . The spread of data points around the solid curves which are drawn for a guide to the eye indicates the experimental errors . FIG . 10 .

Redistribution subject to AIP license or copyright , see http : / / jcp . aip . org / jcp / copyright . jsp precise value for the charge of apoferritin . However , for the two lower buffer concentrations (cid:1) the points (cid:4) and (cid:5) in Fig . 11 (cid:2) , the Debye screening length becomes too large as com - pared to the mesh size for the higher fd concentrations (cid:1) the points where (cid:4) Q (cid:22)(cid:17) 10 are not included in Fig . 11 (cid:2) . This is why the data points for the two lower buffer concentrations in Fig . 11 tend to deviate a bit from the master curve on increasing the fd concentration . Note that the hydrodynamic screening length increases with increasing mesh size consid - erably faster than the mesh size itself (cid:3) see Fig . 11 (cid:1) b (cid:2)(cid:4) . The hydrodynamic screening lengths for the nematic phase are given in Figs . 12 (cid:1) a (cid:2) and 12 (cid:1) b (cid:2) for diffusion parallel and perpendicular to the director , respectively . The reason for the absence of data for lower ionic strengths is that the above - mentioned requirements are not met . The experimen - tal errors for the 20 mM buffer concentration and perpen - dicular diffusion are too large to draw a line to guide the eye . Two conclusions can be drawn from Fig . 12 . First of all , the hydrodynamic screening length for the perpendicular case is larger than that for the parallel case . This implies that shear waves created by a tracer sphere that moves perpendicular to the director penetrates the nematic network deeper as com - pared to a sphere moving parallel to the director . Secondly , hydrodynamic screening lengths considerably increase at a given fd concentration when the ionic strength is decreased . This is due to the increase of orientational order of the fd suspensions on decreasing the ionic strength . For the same reason , the screening length increases for a given ionic strength on increasing the fd concentration . In the nematic state , the decrease of the screening length due to increasing fd concentration is overruled by the much greater increase of the screening length due to the increasing orientational order . As can be seen in Figs . 12 (cid:1) a (cid:2) and 7 , the screening length for the parallel case increases by a factor of 3 (cid:1) from (cid:4) −1 / L = 0 . 1 to about 0 . 3 (cid:2) at an fd concentration of 14 mg / ml on increasing the order parameter from 0 . 71 to 0 . 90 . For the perpendicular case , the screening length increases by a factor of 3 to 4 (cid:1) from (cid:4) −1 / L = 0 . 15 to about 0 . 55 (cid:2) at an fd concen - tration of 23 mg / ml on increasing the order parameter from 0 . 65 to about 0 . 8 . There is thus a very sensitive dependence of the hydrodynamic screening length on the orientational order parameter . Since the rods are very much longer than the (cid:1) aniso - tropic (cid:2) mesh size of the nematic network , the rods are prob - ably very much entangled also in the nematic state . Hydro - dynamic interactions are therefore also screened in the nematic networks . There is , however , no direct evidence for strong entanglement in these nematic fd networks . Since we are probing tracer diffusion of a sphere that is much smaller than the mesh size of the network , the different screening lengths of the rod network that are found in directions par - allel and perpendicular to the nematic director cannot be at - tributed to the different viscosities in these two directions . VII . SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION A theory is developed for tracer diffusion of a sphere through networks of long and thin stiff rods , with the inclu - sion of interactions between the tracer sphere and the net - work due to charges . The tracer sphere is assumed to be small as compared to the mesh size of the network . Screened hydrodynamic interactions , hard - core interactions , and charge interactions between the tracer sphere and the rod network are accounted for . Simple scaling relations are de - rived , where the effects of hydrodynamic interactions and direct interactions decouple in the sense that the diffusion coefﬁcient is a product of two factors which are entirely determined by hydrodynamics and direct interactions . Long - time diffusion coefﬁcients have been measured by means of ﬂuorescence correlation spectroscopy for various ionic strengths as a function of the rod concentration . As a tracer sphere , we used apoferritin and the rod network consists of fd - virus particles . In the nematic phase , just above the bin - odal , the diffusion coefﬁcients for motion of the tracer sphere parallel and perpendicular to the director are typically a fac - tor of 2 different . Order parameters have been measured for the same ionic strengths , again as a function of the rod con - centration . These data extend earlier measurements to lower ionic strengths . At these lower ionic strengths (cid:1) below about 1 mM (cid:2) , the order parameter at the nematic - binodal concen - tration can be as large as 0 . 9 . A simple empirical scaling relation is found . It describes both the ionic - strength and rod - concentration dependences of the orientational order pa - rameter . The hydrodynamic screening length is extracted from the experimental diffusion coefﬁcients and order pa - rameters , using the scaling relations that account for hydro - dynamic as well as direct interactions . For the isotropic net - works , the hydrodynamic screening lengths for all ionic strengths as a function of rod concentration collapse on a single curve . Here , the charge of the apoferritin particle is taken to be equal to −3 elementary charges , which is of the same order as found in independent studies . In the nematic networks , the screening length is found to increase with in - creasing rod concentration for the ionic strengths for which the theory can be applied . This is due to a pronounced in - crease of the screening length on increasing the orientational order parameter , as is clear from a comparison of the screen - ing length for different ionic strengths . As yet , there is no independent theory for the hydrody - namic screening length in the isotropic of nematic networks of rods . In particular , the master curve for the screening FIG . 12 . The hydrodynamic screening length (cid:4) −1 in units of the length L of the rods vs the fd concentration for the nematic phase parallel (cid:1) a (cid:2) and per - pendicular (cid:1) b (cid:2) to the director . The symbols refer to the different buffer concentrations : c T = 4 . 00 mM (cid:1) (cid:4) (cid:2) , 20 . 0 mM (cid:1) (cid:3) (cid:2) , and 20 mM + 100 mM NaCl (cid:1) (cid:5) (cid:2) . Error bars correspond to the experimental errors in the measured diffusion coefﬁcients . 214501 - 13 Diffusion of spheres in networks of rods J . Chem .

Also , the origin of the sensitive dependence of the screening length on the orientational order parameter of nematic net - works is not yet understood . The range of validity of the present theory can in prin - ciple be extended to relatively larger Debye lengths as com - pared to the mesh size by considering the shadowing effect where the sphere is allowed to instantaneously interact with more than just a single rod . Such an extended theory would allow us to extract the hydrodynamic screening length from our data at lower ionic strengths as well . This remains a future challenge . Erratum to Ref . 15 . An error is made in Ref . 15 in the calculation of L hc . In transforming the Smoluchowski equa - tion (cid:3) Eq . (cid:1) 14 (cid:2)(cid:4) to cylindrical coordinates , the middle term on the left - hand side in Eq . (cid:1) 16 (cid:2) was erroneously omitted . All results in Ref . 15 remain correct when (cid:14) there is set equal to 1 (cid:1) instead of the erroneous value of 1 . 618 ¯ (cid:2) . Furthermore , for the high salt case considered in Ref . 15 , the shadowing effect is very small , so that the quantitative results in that reference are not affected by this error .

APPENDIX A : SOLUTION OF EQUATION „ 16 … The function L (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:2) is written as L hc (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:2) + L Q (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:2) , where the hard - core contribution L hc is given by Eq . (cid:1) 17 (cid:2) and L Q is the additional contribution due to charge interactions . Since g 0 = g 0 , hc g 0 , Q , where g 0 , hc = exp (cid:13) − (cid:9) V hc (cid:14) is the hard - core pair - correlation function , and g 0 , Q = exp (cid:13) − (cid:9) V Q (cid:14) , Eq . (cid:1) 16 (cid:2) can be written as g 0 , hc (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:2) (cid:7) dL Q 2 (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:2) d (cid:7) 2 + 1 (cid:7) dL Q (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:2) d (cid:7) − L Q (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:2) (cid:7) 2 (cid:9) = (cid:11) (cid:9) g 0 , hc (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:2) dV Q (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:2) d (cid:7) − dg 0 , hc (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:2) d (cid:7) (cid:12) (cid:8) (cid:7) (cid:9) + dL hc (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:2) d (cid:7) + dL Q (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:2) d (cid:7) (cid:9) . (cid:1) A1 (cid:2) This differential equation can be cast into an integral equa - tion as follows . First note that for (cid:7)(cid:11) a + D / 2 this reduces to dL Q 2 (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:2) d (cid:7) 2 + 1 (cid:7) dL Q (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:2) d (cid:7) − L Q (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:2) (cid:7) 2 = (cid:9) dV Q (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:2) d (cid:7) (cid:7) (cid:9) + dL hc (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:2) d (cid:7) + dL Q (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:2) d (cid:7) (cid:9) . (cid:1) A2 (cid:2) The substitution of L Q (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:2) = C (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:2) L hc (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:2) as an ansatz into Eq . (cid:1) A2 (cid:2) and the use of dL hc (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:2) / d (cid:7) = − L hc (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:2) / (cid:7) give d d (cid:7) (cid:7) L hc (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:2) dC (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:2) d (cid:7) (cid:9) = (cid:9) dV Q (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:2) d (cid:7) (cid:7) (cid:9) − L hc (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:2) (cid:7) + dL Q (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:2) d (cid:7) (cid:9) . (cid:1) A3 (cid:2) Integration thus leads to C (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:2) = A + (cid:10) a + D / 2 (cid:7) d (cid:7) (cid:1) L hc−1 (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:1) (cid:2) (cid:8) (cid:11) B + (cid:9) (cid:10) a + D / 2 (cid:7) (cid:1) d (cid:7) (cid:2) dV Q (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:2) (cid:2) d (cid:7) (cid:2) (cid:8) (cid:7) (cid:9) − L hc (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:7) (cid:2) + dL Q (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:2) (cid:2) d (cid:7) (cid:2) (cid:9) (cid:12) , (cid:1) A4 (cid:2) where A and B are integration constants . Since L Q (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:2) → 0 for (cid:7) → (cid:12) , the term within the curly brackets should vanish as (cid:7) (cid:1) → (cid:12) . This sets B equal to B = − (cid:9) (cid:10) a + D / 2 (cid:12) d (cid:7) (cid:2) dV Q (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:2) (cid:2) d (cid:7) (cid:2) (cid:7) (cid:9) − L hc (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:7) (cid:2) + dL Q (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:2) (cid:2) d (cid:7) (cid:2) (cid:9) , (cid:1) A5 (cid:2) and , hence , C (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:2) = A − (cid:9) (cid:10) a + D / 2 (cid:7) d (cid:7) (cid:1) L hc−1 (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:1) (cid:2) (cid:10) (cid:7) (cid:1) (cid:12) d (cid:7) (cid:2) dV Q (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:2) (cid:2) d (cid:7) (cid:2) (cid:8) (cid:7) (cid:9) − L hc (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:7) (cid:2) + dL Q (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:2) (cid:2) d (cid:7) (cid:2) (cid:9) . (cid:1) A6 (cid:2) The integration constant A can be determined similarly as for the hard - core case considered in Ref . 15 . The integration of Eq . (cid:1) A1 (cid:2) from a + D / 2− (cid:13) to a + D / 2 + (cid:13) with vanishing (cid:13) , using dg hc (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:2) / d (cid:7) = (cid:24) (cid:1) (cid:7) − a − D / 2 (cid:2) (cid:1) with (cid:24) the one - dimensional delta distribution (cid:2) , gives dL (cid:1) (cid:7) = a + D / 2 (cid:2) d (cid:7) = − (cid:9) . (cid:1) A7 (cid:2) Since dL hc (cid:1) (cid:7) = a + D / 2 (cid:2) / d (cid:7) = − (cid:9) , it follows that dL Q (cid:1) (cid:7) = a + D / 2 (cid:2) / d (cid:7) = 0 . Equation (cid:1) A6 (cid:2) and L Q = CL hc shows that A = B / (cid:9) , where B is given in Eq . (cid:1) A5 (cid:2) . The resulting integral equation for L Q is most conveniently written as L Q (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:2) = − L hc (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:2) (cid:7) F c + (cid:9) (cid:10) a + D / 2 (cid:7) d (cid:7) (cid:1) L hc−1 (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:1) (cid:2) F (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:1) (cid:2) (cid:9) , (cid:1) A8 (cid:2) where F (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:1) (cid:2) = (cid:10) (cid:7) (cid:1) (cid:12) d (cid:7) (cid:2) dV Q (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:2) (cid:2) d (cid:7) (cid:2) (cid:7) (cid:9) − L hc (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:7) (cid:2) + dL Q (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:2) (cid:2) d (cid:7) (cid:2) (cid:9) (cid:1) A9 (cid:2) and F c = F (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:1) = a + D / 2 (cid:2) is the contact value of F (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:1) (cid:2) .

The transformation to cylindrical coordinates as deﬁned in Fig . 2 proceeds in a similar way as described in Appendix B of Ref . 15 . To evaluate the ensemble averages , ﬁrst note that g 0 = g 0 , hc g 0 , Q , with g 0 , hc = exp (cid:13) − (cid:9) V hc (cid:14) as the hard - core part of the pair - correlation function (cid:1) with V hc as the hard - core inter - action potential (cid:2) and g 0 , Q = 1− (cid:9) V Q as the contribution due to the charge interactions to leading order . Useful relations for the calculation of the ensemble averages are g 0 , hc (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:2) = H (cid:1) (cid:7) − a − D / 2 (cid:2) , exp (cid:13) − (cid:9) V hc (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:2)(cid:14) dV hc (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:2) / d (cid:7) = − (cid:9) −1 (cid:24) (cid:1) (cid:7) − a − D / 2 (cid:2) , (cid:1) B2 (cid:2) dL hc (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:2) / d (cid:7) = − L hc (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:2) / (cid:7) , where H is the Heaviside function and (cid:24) is the delta distri - bution . From these relations it is easily veriﬁed that to ﬁrst order in charge - interaction contributions , (cid:5) (cid:3) V (cid:6) = − (cid:2)(cid:7) ¯L F ext (cid:11) − (cid:9) −1 (cid:1) a + D / 2 (cid:2)(cid:1) L hc c + L Qc − (cid:9) L hc c V Qc (cid:2) + (cid:10) a + D / 2 (cid:12) d (cid:7)(cid:7) dV Q (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:2) d (cid:7) L hc (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:2) (cid:12) , (cid:1) B3 (cid:2) where , as before , the contact value H c of a function H of (cid:7) is deﬁned as H c = H (cid:1) (cid:7) = a + D / 2 (cid:2) . Using form (cid:1) 17 (cid:2) for L hc in the integral , this expression reduces to (cid:5) (cid:3) V (cid:6) = (cid:2)(cid:7) ¯L F ext (cid:9) −1 (cid:1) a + D / 2 (cid:2)(cid:1) L hc c + L Q c (cid:2) . (cid:1) B4 (cid:2) The substitution of Eqs . (cid:1) 22 (cid:2) and (cid:1) 23 (cid:2) ﬁnally leads to Eq . (cid:1) 24 (cid:2) for (cid:5) (cid:3) V (cid:6) .

APPENDIX C : THE DEPENDENCE OF (cid:1) h ON (cid:2) D AND S The scaling functions (cid:15) iso , (cid:17) , (cid:1) h are independent of (cid:4) D for those values of (cid:4) D and (cid:4) L where the functions G and H in Eq . (cid:1) 6 (cid:2) are such that G is equal to 1 2 ln (cid:13) (cid:4) D (cid:14) and H / (cid:1) G + H (cid:2) is equal to 1 / 2 . The functions G / 1 2 ln (cid:13) (cid:4) D (cid:14) and H / (cid:1) G + H (cid:2) are plotted in Fig . 13 versus (cid:4) D for various values of (cid:4) L . As can be seen , these functions reach their limiting values to within about 5 % for (cid:4) D (cid:17) 0 . 05 for all (cid:4) L in the range of 1 – 20 . Within the range of validity of the Debye - Büche - Brinkman approach , we can therefore use the limiting forms of the two above - mentioned functions . Next , consider the explicit orientational - order - parameter dependence of (cid:5) h that enters through the orientational pdf in Eq . (cid:1) 9 (cid:2) . Numerical results for (cid:5) h are given in Fig . 14 , for the nematic networks parallel and perpendicular to the nematic director , for the parameters pertaining to fd virus and apof - erritin . These numerical results are obtained using the fol - lowing Gaussian form for the orientational pdf (cid:1) Ref . 45 (cid:2) : FIG . 13 .

The parameter C measures the width of the orientational dis - tribution and is set by the scalar orientational order param - eter S . Furthermore , N is the normalization constant , which is also a function of S . This representation has also been used in Ref . 15 for similar experiments at high salt concentrations . As can be seen , (cid:5) h is only weakly dependent on the orientational order parameter once the hydrodynamic screen - ing length is ﬁxed . That is , the orientational - order - parameter dependence of (cid:5) h is essentially only due to the implicit orientational - order - parameter dependence of the hydrody - namic screening length (cid:4) −1 . To a good approximation , (cid:5) h is therefore only a function of (cid:4) −1 / L , which shows that (cid:15) h is independent of S as far as the explicit dependence through the orientational pdf is concerned . This weak explicit depen - dence on the orientational order parameter has also been veriﬁed for other parameters than those for fd virus and apo - ferritin . APPENDIX D : THE EFFECT OF CO 2 ON IONIC STRENGTH AND p H Let H 2 CO 3 denote dissolved , hydrated carbon dioxide . The concentration of hydrated CO 2 is directly proportional to the partial pressure p CO 2 of gaseous CO 2 in the air , (cid:3) H 2 CO 3 (cid:4) = K CO 2 p CO 2 , (cid:1) D1 (cid:2) where (cid:3) X (cid:4) denotes the concentration of a substance X in M (cid:21) moles / dm 3 . The constant K CO 2 is independent of the p H since it describes the mere solvation of gaseous carbon diox - ide . Carbonic acid will dissociate in HCO 3− and CO 32− . The mass - action laws for these dissociation reactions are (cid:3) H + (cid:4)(cid:3) HCO 3− (cid:4) (cid:3) H 2 CO 3 (cid:4) = K C 1 = (cid:1) 4 . 3 (cid:8) 10 −7 (cid:2) M , (cid:1) D2 (cid:2) (cid:3) H + (cid:4)(cid:3) CO 32− (cid:4) (cid:3) HCO 3− (cid:4) = K C 2 = (cid:1) 5 . 6 (cid:8) 10 −11 (cid:2) M , where the acid constants K C j are independent of the p H and ionic strength . Unprotonated and protonated Tris will be denoted as T and T + , respectively . The mass - action law for the Tris - protonation reaction is (cid:3) H + (cid:4)(cid:3) T (cid:4) (cid:3) T + (cid:4) (cid:21) K T = (cid:1) 7 . 9 (cid:8) 10 −9 (cid:2) M . (cid:1) D3 (cid:2) Again , the acid constant K T is independent of the p H and ionic strength . Neglecting the very small concentration of undissociated HCl , the remaining relations that are necessary to calculate the p H and ionic strength are 2 (cid:3) CO 32− (cid:4) + (cid:3) HCO 3− (cid:4) + (cid:3) Cl − (cid:4) + (cid:3) OH − (cid:4) = (cid:3) T + (cid:4) + (cid:3) H + (cid:4) , (cid:3) Cl − (cid:4) = c a , (cid:1) D4 (cid:2) (cid:3) T (cid:4) + (cid:3) T + (cid:4) = c T , (cid:3) H + (cid:4)(cid:3) OH − (cid:4) (cid:21) K w = 10 −14 . 0 M 2 , where c T and c a denote the total (cid:1) or “analytical” (cid:2) concentra - tion of Tris and HCl in units of M (cid:21) moles / dm 3 , respectively (cid:1) the subscripts stand for Tris and acid (cid:2) . The ﬁrst equation expresses electroneutrality , the second and third equations are conservation equations , while the fourth equation is the mass - action law for the dissociation of water . From the above equations it is readily found that the H + concentration is the solution of the following quartic equa - tion : (cid:3) H + (cid:4) 4 + (cid:3) H + (cid:4) 3 (cid:1) c T − c a + K T (cid:2) − (cid:3) H + (cid:4) 2 (cid:1) K w + c a K T (cid:2) − (cid:3) H + (cid:4) K w K T = K C 1 K CO 2 p CO 2 (cid:13)(cid:3) H + (cid:4) 2 + (cid:3) H + (cid:4)(cid:1) 2 K C 2 + K T (cid:2) + 2 K C 2 K T (cid:14) . (cid:1) D5 (cid:2) The ionic strength is equal to I = 1 2 (cid:13)(cid:3) H + (cid:4) + (cid:3) OH − (cid:4) + (cid:3) T + (cid:4) + (cid:3) Cl − (cid:4) + (cid:3) HCO 3− (cid:4) + 4 (cid:3) CO 32− (cid:4)(cid:14) , (cid:1) D6 (cid:2) where the various concentrations can be expressed in terms of (cid:3) H + (cid:4) from Eqs . (cid:1) D1 (cid:2) – (cid:1) D4 (cid:2) as (cid:3) OH − (cid:4) = K w / (cid:3) H + (cid:4) , (cid:3) T + (cid:4) = c T (cid:3) H + (cid:4) / (cid:1)(cid:3) H + (cid:4) + K T (cid:2) , (cid:3) Cl − (cid:4) = c a , (cid:1) D7 (cid:2) (cid:3) HCO 3− (cid:4) = K C 1 K CO 2 p CO 2 / (cid:3) H + (cid:4) , (cid:3) CO 32− (cid:4) = K C 1 K C 2 K CO 2 p CO 2 / (cid:3) H + (cid:4) 2 . The ionic strength can thus be calculated once (cid:3) H + (cid:4) is ob - tained as the (cid:1) numerical (cid:2) solution of Eq . (cid:1) D5 (cid:2) . The value of the constant K CO 2 p CO 2 can be used as a ﬁtting parameter to the experimental p H data . A value of 0 . 015 mM gives rise to the solid curves in Fig . 4 . Tabulated values for the solubility of gaseous CO 2 refer to the total amount of dissolved CO 2 , including HCO 3− and CO 32− . That is , Henry’s constant H CO 2 , deﬁned as (cid:3) H 2 CO 3 (cid:4) + (cid:3) HCO 3− (cid:4) + (cid:3) CO 32− (cid:4) = H CO 2 p CO 2 , (cid:1) D8 (cid:2) is tabulated for pure air . The p H dependence of Henry’s con - stant H CO 2 can be obtained from the mass - action laws (cid:3) Eq . (cid:1) D2 (cid:2)(cid:4) . Eliminating (cid:3) HCO 3− (cid:4) and (cid:3) CO 32− (cid:4) in Eq . (cid:1) D8 (cid:2) in favor of (cid:3) H + (cid:4) and (cid:3) H 2 CO 3 (cid:4) gives (cid:3) H 2 CO 3 (cid:4) (cid:11) 1 + K C 1 (cid:3) H + (cid:4) + K C 1 K C 2 (cid:3) H + (cid:4) 2 (cid:12) = H CO 2 p CO 2 . (cid:1) D9 (cid:2) Comparing to Eq . (cid:1) D1 (cid:2) thus leads to 214501 - 16 Kang et al . J . Chem . Phys . 126 , 214501 (cid:2) 2007 (cid:1) Downloaded 21 Sep 2007 to 134 . 94 . 112 . 209 .

(cid:1) D10 (cid:2) This equation speciﬁes the p H dependence of Henry’s con - stant H CO 2 . Tabulated values for Henry’s constant do not of - ten specify the p H at which they are measured . The value that we ﬁnd for K CO 2 , however , is of the same order as one would ﬁnd from tabulated values of H CO 2 together with Eq . (cid:1) D10 (cid:2) using reasonable values for the p H . The Tris / HCl buffers are prepared by adding a small volume of HCl with a concentration of 1 M , to a 20 . 0 mM Tris solution till a p H of 8 . 2 is attained . This buffer is then diluted with de - ionized water for the preparation of the lower Tris / HCl buffer concentrations . The analytical concentration c a of HCl after attaining a p H of 8 . 2 of the 20 . 0 mM Tris solution is found from the above equations to be equal to c a = 8 . 85 mM for the 20 . 0 mM Tris / HCl buffer . (cid:1) D11 (cid:2) The analytical concentrations c a and c T for the diluted buff - ers are simply equal to the initial values 8 . 85 mM for c a and 20 . 0 mM for c T , divided by the dilution factor . 1 S .
