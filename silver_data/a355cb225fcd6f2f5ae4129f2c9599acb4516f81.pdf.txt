Dynamic switches between these metastable conformations underlie signal transduction . The properties of regulatory switches can be formalized and captured , as , for example , in the new “switches . ELM” bioinformatics resource 2 . Cooperativity is as pervasive for receptors in the plasma membrane as it is for transcription factors in the chromatin 10 , 11 . In recent years , proteomic analyses have revealed that regulatory proteins almost always pull down groups of other pro - teins 1 . It is but a short logical step to con - clude that regulatory proteins spend most of their time entwined in macromolecu - lar complexes and that , therefore , a com - plete description of cell signaling will be a description of the dynamic behavior within and between these complexes . Regulatory decisions themselves , as we have previously argued , are made by in - complex coopera - tive molecular switching 2 . Furthermore , as part of the spatial organization of the cell , proteins are often synthesized in the cellu - lar locations where they are needed 3 , and many regulatory proteins exist at remark - ably low numbers per cell 4 , 5 . These obser - vations collectively contradict the simplistic view that proteins are made somewhere in the cytosol , diffuse as free agents to some ‘useful’ location and then cascade around the cell , thereby generating signaling path - ways 6 . This pervasively held belief comes at least in part from experiments involving massive transient overexpression . Transient transfection techniques have been continually developed and applied for over 30 years to address key questions in cell biology . Indeed , many high - profile studies of cell signaling have almost exclusively made use of transient overexpression . Such an approach obliterates subtlety and hence might result in overly simplistic models of signaling , as these networks are pervaded by cross - talk and feedback control mecha - nisms 7 . Here we argue for a change in the way that cell signaling is studied . We consid - er it unsafe to develop models of cell regu - lation based solely on transient overexpres - sion and that results should be confirmed at native expression and / or in vitro . In the near future , the requirement to work in - cell at close to native expression levels will be aided by switching from transient transfec - tion to stably transfected cell lines . unbalancing gene dosage Genetic studies have shown that mutations that affect the expression levels of regulato - ry proteins are often deleterious and domi - nantly inherited . For good experimental design , it is important to understand that the physical interactions of regulatory pro - teins are what make them so sensitive to gene dosage . Cooperative interactions in macromolecu - lar complexes . A remarkably large number of known pairwise regulatory interactions display affinities in the low micromo - lar range that are too weak to make stable complexes 8 , 9 . This implies that most binary macromolecular interactions cannot by themselves create a regulatory event . Rather , regulatory decisions are made within com - plexes by cooperative molecular switching 2 . As we have previously argued , essentially all regulatory interactions in the cell are cooper - ative . This means that the individually weak binding interactions work with or against Toby J .

However , overexpression can violate balanced gene dosage , affecting protein folding , complex assembly and downstream regulation . To avoid these problems , genome engineering technologies now enable the generation of stable cell lines expressing modified proteins at ( almost ) native levels . Scaffold concentration Kinase activity The bell curve i ii iii Figure 1 | Illustration of how varying a scaffold concentration can result in a bell - shaped curve of signaling protein activity . A scaffold ( gray ) may assemble a complex with kinase ( green ) , kinase inhibitor ( red ) , kinase activator ( lilac ) and substrate molecules ( blue ) . Under normal cellular conditions , the complex is regulated by incoming signals ( not shown ) specifying activation or inactivation . When the complexes are activated ( i , top ) , the phosphorylation site ( yellow ) can enter the kinase active - site cleft and be phosphorylated . Under inactive conditions ( i , bottom ) , the site is excluded from the cleft . Increasing concentration of scaffold leads to partial complexes ( ii ) , some of which may be constitutively active . Massive increase of scaffold ( iii ) dilutes the other components so that active complexes are no longer made . n p g © 2013 N a t u r e A m e r i ca , I n c . A ll r i gh t s r ese r ve d . 716 | VOL . 10 NO . 8 | AUGUST 2013 | nature methods commentary Such bell curves are well known to pharma - cologists , who use terms such as “biphasic , ” “inverted U - shaped” or “hormesis” 18 to describe these shapes . In addition to the gene dosage balance artifacts , there can be other undesirable effects of overexpression . A key property of intrinsically disordered proteins ( IUPs ) is the capacity to make large numbers of interactions , which may further increase in number , but decrease in specificity , when IUPs are overexpressed 19 . Fluorophore tags may themselves have a preference for self - association such that , at high intracellular concentrations , they can cause expressed proteins to assemble into complexes 20 . Finally , flooding the cellular system with overexpressed proteins may result in ectopic cellular localizations 20 . Thus , many overex - pressed proteins tend to show diffuse local - izations , whereas at native expression they may display punctate staining patterns 20 . Systemic error caused by unbalanced gene dosage . Transcription factors ( TFs ) can be exquisitely sensitive to gene dosage effects , which may contribute to down - stream system perturbations if the TFs are overexpressed . This is epitomized in vivo by eye - development TFs , such as the forkhead factor encoded by FOXC1 , whose dosage alteration in any direction ( typically het - erozygous deletions or duplications ) leads to similar ocular phenotypes 21 . It follows that experimental misexpression of such regula - tors may lead to unforeseen downstream side effects . TF overexpression can also give rise to global effects , as in the fly GAL4 sys - tem : this ‘ in vivo ’ gene overexpression sys - tem involving the yeast transcription fac - tor GAL4 is commonly used in Drosophila melanogaster to express genes driven by an upstream activator sequence ( UAS ) . But as has been shown in a genomic analysis , high levels of GAL4 change the expres - sion of many Drosophila genes in a UAS - independent manner 22 . Paradoxically , the overexpression of a potent transcriptional activator can suppress the transcription of its target genes . This phenomenon , called ‘squelching’ , is considered to result from titration of limiting TFs 23 , much in the way we have already discussed above in the con - text of activity bell curves . Probing mutated proteins by overexpression Overexpression is commonly used to study the effects of point mutations or trunc - Most gene products—RNAs and pro - teins—interact with multiple cellular com - ponents , often in a stoichiometric fash - ion . In agreement with this idea , in many organisms , components of stable protein complexes tend to have similar expres - sion levels ( are said to be ‘isoexpressed’ ) 12 . Perturbation of the stoichiometric balance in macromolecular complexes and cellular circuits can be a source of cellular malfunc - tion and , therefore , of abnormal pheno - types . This is the basic claim of the gene dosage balance hypothesis 13 . Chromosomes highlight sensitivity to gene dosage . Studies of human aneuploidy syndromes suggest that the phenotypic effects of even moderate alterations in gene dosage are severe . It has long been known that trisomy 21 is the only viable autosomal aneuploidy in humans . Chromosome 21 is the shortest human autosome and also has the lowest number of dosage - sensitive genes 14 . Another well - known manifesta - tion of a mechanism to maintain gene dos - age balance is inactivation of the second X chromosome in female mammals 15 . Gene dosage artifacts . The overproduc - tion of a protein that bridges two or more subunits of a complex may lead to the for - mation of inactive subcomplexes and alter biological output . This effect has been observed experimentally and has also been mathematically modeled in MAP kinase signaling , which is facilitated by scaffold proteins that place the molecular actors in close proximity . Experimental increase of the concentration of scaffold proteins to substoichiometric levels enhances signaling but at higher expression causes a decrease in signaling 16 . Beyond the optimal scaffold concentration , incomplete , inactive sub - complexes appear 17 . This leads to a skewed bell - shaped curve in a plot of kinase activ - ity versus scaffold concentration ( Fig . 1 ) .

The NES motif needs to be accessible to bind to the export protein CRM1 . Unsurprisingly , therefore , the well - studied canonical NESs such as those present in P53 , PKI - a and HIV Rev are present in well - described IUP regions 29 . However , when protein databases are searched with such short hydrophobic motifs , these motifs overwhelmingly match buried residues of hydrophobic protein cores 29 . Thus , proposed NES motifs in c - ABL1 , UPF3B and TBX5 do not have the possibility of ever being accessible to CRM1 under physiological conditions 30 – 32 . In Table 1 , we provide a set of ten report - ed NESs , all of which are buried inside ently functional in one of the overexpres - sion transfection experiments is buried in the structural core of the kinase domain ( Fig . 2 ) , with the arginine and leucine from the motif facing inward ( and in the case of the arginine , making buried salt - bridge interactions ) . Mutation of such buried residues in the kinase domain could unfold the kinase , inactivating it and resulting in aggregation : it is known that the exposure of the hydrophobic core in misfolded pro - teins often leads to aggregation 27 . Nuclear export sequences in hiding . Nuclear export sequence ( NES ) motifs typically consist of a closely grouped tet - ations of a given protein . The abolition of a given function as a result of the muta - tion is often taken as logical proof that the function has been directly inactivated . Unfortunately , there may be alternative explanations for loss of function in this type of experiment . For instance , aggregation of misfolded protein in conditions of overex - pression can lead to an oversimplified and misleading appraisal of biological reality as discussed in the following examples . D - box difficulties : an unholy alliance between unfolding and overexpression . During anaphase , the anaphase - promot - ing complex , or cyclosome ( APC / C ) , tar - gets proteins for destruction , recognizing either KEN - box or D - box peptide tags 24 . The kinases aurora A and aurora B have an N - terminal KEN - box sequence that is strongly conserved and that exists in a region of intrinsically unstructured poly - peptide ( Fig . 2 ) . Nguyen et al . 25 used over - expression transfections of GFP - tagged aurora B to demonstrate that the KEN box functions as a degron for APC / C - mediated degradation . They also mutated four pre - dicted D boxes in aurora B and found that these mutations did not affect degradation . However , Stewart and Fang 26 used overex - pression transfections to test mutations of two of the D - box motifs ( but not the KEN box ) . They found that the mutation of one of them blocked in - cell protein degradation , from which they inferred that this was an APC / C - binding D box . What might underlie the inconsistency of these results ? The D box that was appar - Figure 3 | Structural context of one true and three postulated NESs in human proteins .

The third most important control is ruling out the presence of in - cell aggregates of a pro - tein that is supposed to be soluble . In - cell protein precipitation can be revealed by the light microscope by , for example , bire - fringence of protein aggregates stained with Congo red 27 . Other microscopic approaches include molecular - rotor dye fluorescence 33 , immunostaining to reveal the existence of non – wild - type protein distribution or aggregation and , for flu - orophore - tagged proteins , fluorescence recovery after photobleaching 34 . A pre - cipitated protein should result in termi - nation of the experiment . Finally , protein function probed via transfection with presumed loss - of - function mutations should have results consistent with those of short interfering RNA knockdown of the endogenous gene . because this is the compartment where the overexpressed proteins accumulate . A com - bination of unfolding and aggregation will thus artifactually yield the expected result for abrogation of a bona fide NES . Controlling overenthusiastic overexpres - sion . There are some steps that research - ers can take to identify artifactual results in transient transfection protocols . The most important control is testing the structural or functional integrity of mutant proteins by a different experimental approach , be it biochemical , biophysical or structural . For instance , if a protein kinase mutation is not supposed to destroy enzymatic activ - ity , test the mutant kinase for its activity . If an SH2 domain is mutated to interfere with a binding interaction , check that it is still folded . A little biochemistry will go a long way . The second most important con - trol is checking that the observation ( that globular domains . A structural view ( Fig . 3 ) contrasts the accessibility of NES residues in the true CRM1 interactor snurportin with three problematic NES candidates . For most of these implausible NESs , the usual set of nuclear - export experiments ( heavily dependent on overexpression ) were performed : mutagenesis of the hydro - phobic residues , leptomycin B inhibition of export , and assaying of the isolated NES peptide sequence in a strongly express - ing reporter construct . The experimental results always appeared to support NES functionality . However , these results do not rule out an alternative explanation : muta - tion of buried residues may be expected to unfold the protein , and proteins bearing such unfolding mutations will probably be imported into the nucleus owing to the uncompromised nuclear localization sig - nal .

Additionally , stable BAC transgenic lines can be generated in a high - throughput manner 36 and be made available to other researchers , as with a recently published cell resource focused on motor proteins 38 . In a second approach , the gene of interest is engineered in situ ; gene - trap methods are being adapted for this purpose 39 . A complete such as FOXC1 , PAX6 or SOX2 . Moreover , BACs might not always contain all of the required regulatory sequences , lead - ing to inappropriate expression patterns and levels . BAC transgenesis does have the compensatory advantage that there are two forms of the expressed protein , tagged and untagged , which can provide a useful quantitation control in proteomic analyses and can be used for rescue experi - the future of cell - signaling research : stably engineered cell lines In the longer term it is desirable to move away from transient transfection techniques as a primary research tool . A well - established approach to modify an endogenous locus ( whether for tagging , mutating or knocking - in ) is homologous recombination .

In parallel , genome engineering methods are increasingly accessible to nonspecialist labs , and the smaller - scale generation of lines driven by specific biological questions will undoubtedly accelerate as well . conclusion Engineered cell lines now allow cell regu - lation to be studied with tagged proteins expressed at ( almost ) native levels . These tools can eliminate the need for transient overexpression , except as a ‘quick and dirty’ exploratory technique or when clearly designated as a deliberate cell per - turbation . Transient transfection results can be suggestive but are not confirma - tory . If we want to develop realistic mod - els of cellular regulatory systems , we need to explore how the cellular components interact with each other under the normal range of cellular conditions . Used as the main tool , transient overexpression simply cannot deliver that knowledge , for it can - not reveal the subtleties and the complexi - ties of cell regulation . acKnoWLedGments We thank many colleagues at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory , Monod Institute and two research consortia , the German National Genome Research Network – funded DiGtoP and European Union – funded SyBoSS—which are focused on developing and applying genome engineered cell lines—for useful discussions .

Signal . 6 , rs7 ( 2013 ) . review of genome engineering methods is beyond the scope of this paper ; however , we provide a non - exhaustive list of techniques and resources currently available for modi - fying endogenous genes and for studying gene function in conditions closer to those in vivo ( Table 2 ) . In particular , targeted tools such as zinc - finger nucleases and transcrip - tion activator – like effector nucleases can be designed to cleave a genomic sequence of interest and thus substantially increase the efficiency of homologous recombination at a desired site . These tools are increasingly becoming cost effective , enabling many labs studying cell regulation to generate stable cell lines expressing modified proteins of interest . In parallel , these tools are now also beginning to be mass produced by both pri - vate and public enterprises 40 . As instruments of cell signaling research , stably tagged cell lines have fundamen - tal properties that cannot be matched by transient approaches ( Table 3 ) and that are often critical for experimental success . In contrast to GFP - tagged proteins in cells in which a gene is massively overexpressed 20 , GFP - tagged proteins expressed in stable cell lines frequently show spatially restricted localizations ( Fig . 4 ) . We invite the reader to compare any of the images of GFP - tagged proteins expressed from BAC transgenes in Poser et al . 36 with images from an overex - pression study of the same protein : even where some residual punctate structure is visible , overexpression typically causes dis - persed fluorescence indicative of protein that is freely diffusing and / or involved in non - native interactions . With an engineered cell line expressing the tagged protein at native levels , by contrast , the protein can be followed under any condition . In particu - lar , its behavior can be tracked during the cell cycle or in differentiating cells . It can be studied under a variety of cellular per - turbations such as stress , RNAi knockdown or transient overexpression of interacting proteins . ( Observe that transient overex - pression will now be correctly treated as a perturbation ! ) Genome - engineered cell lines don’t just provide ( approximately ) native expression : they are also a tool to share between labs , and it follows that experiments involving such lines are closer to meeting desired goals of scientific reproducibility . Unfortunately , reproducibility has not been a characteristic of transient overexpression work 7 .
