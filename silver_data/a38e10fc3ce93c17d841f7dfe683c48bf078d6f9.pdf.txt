V . 2007 Abstract Coﬁlin plays a critical role in actin ﬁlament dynamics in a variety of eukaryotic cells . Its activity is regulated by phosphorylation / dephosphorylation of a Ser3 residue on the N - terminal side and / or its binding to a phosphoinositide , PIP 2 . To clarify how coﬁlin activity is regulated in muscle cells , we generated analogues of the unphosphorylated form ( A3 - coﬁlin ) and phosphorylated form ( D3 - coﬁlin ) by converting the phosphorylation site ( Ser3 ) of coﬁlin to Ala and Asp , respectively . These mutated proteins , as well as the coﬁlin having Ser3 residue ( S3 - coﬁlin ) , were produced in an E . coli expression system and conjugated with ﬂuorescent dyes . In an in vitro func - tional assay , A3 - coﬁlin retained the ability to bind to F - actin . Upon injection into cultured muscle cells , A3 - coﬁlin and S3 - coﬁlin promptly disrupted actin ﬁlaments in the cytoplasm , and many cytoplasmic rods containing both the exogenous coﬁlin and actin were generated , while D3 - coﬁlin was simply diffused in the cytoplasm without affecting actin ﬁlaments . Several hours after the injection , however , the activity of A3 - coﬁlin and S3 - coﬁlin was suppressed : the actin - A3 - coﬁlin ( or S3 - coﬁlin ) rods dis - appeared , the coﬁlin diffused in the cytoplasm like D3 - coﬁlin , and actin ﬁlaments reformed . Both GFP - fused A3 - coﬁlin and S3 - coﬁlin that were produced by cDNA transfection were also suppressed in the cytoplasm of muscle cells in culture . Thus , some mechanism ( s ) other than phosphorylation can suppress A3 - coﬁlin activity . We observed that PIP 2 can bind to A3 - coﬁlin just as to S3 - coﬁlin and inhibits the interaction of A3 - coﬁlin with actin . Our results suggest that the activity of A3 - coﬁlin and also S3 - coﬁlin can be regulated by PIP 2 in the cytoplasm of muscle cells . Keywords Coﬁlin (cid:1) Actin (cid:1) Phosphoinositide (cid:1) Muscle cell Introduction Dynamic reorganization of actin is a remarkable event in myoﬁbrillogenesis during the development of striated muscles . In young embryonic muscle cells , actin exists as a mixture of an unpolymerized pool of monomeric actin and ﬁlamentous actin ( Shimizu and Obinata 1986 ) . The latter is mostly bundled in cortical ﬁlaments beneath the plasma membrane ( Fischman 1986 ) and stress - ﬁber - like structures ( Antin et al . 1986 ) or premyoﬁbrils ( for review , see Sanger et al . 2002 ) . As muscle develops , the majority of actin becomes organized into thin actin ﬁlaments in the sarco - meres of myoﬁbrils . Redistribution of pre - existing actin ﬁlament bundles is indispensable for the precise alignment of actin in a striated pattern . Our previous studies have demonstrated that in young myogenic cells , different types of G - actin - binding proteins exist in the cytoplasm to regulate actin polymerization ( for review , see Obinata 1993 ) . They are ADF ( actin depoly - merizing factor ) , coﬁlin , proﬁlin , and thymosin b ( ( Abe and Obinata 1989 ; Abe et al . 1989 ; Ohshima et al . 1989 ; Na - gaoka et al . 1996b ) . Of these proteins , coﬁlin is the only one that continues to exist in muscle cells throughout developmental stages , while expression levels of the other A . Hosoda (cid:1) N . Sato (cid:1) H .

The proteins of the member of the ADF / coﬁlin family are widely distributed in eukaryotic organisms and play a critical role in the actin ﬁlament dynamics in a variety of cell types ( for review , see Bamburg 1999 ; Ono 2003 ) . In mammals , two coﬁlin isoforms are present ; they are non - muscle coﬁlin ( NMCF ) and muscle - type coﬁlin ( MCF ) . MCF is initially expressed in terminally differentiated muscle cells ( Ono et al . 1994 ; Mohri et al . 2000 ) . Chicken coﬁlin is highly homologous with mammalian MCF in its primary structure and both of them interact with F - actin with higher afﬁnity than NMCF and ADF ( Nakashima et al . 2005 ) . Thus , coﬁlin , MCF in the case of mammals , seems to play an important role in the actin dynamics in muscle . Coﬁlin , as well as ADF , binds to G - actin and G - actin units of actin ﬁlaments in a stoichiometry of 1 to 1 and increases the amount of monomeric actin by severing and depolymerizing the ﬁlaments ( Bamburg et al . 1980 ; Nish - ida et al . 1984 ; Hayden et al . 1993 ) . It enhances the turnover of the monomeric units within F - actin ﬁlaments by regulating the rate constants of depolymerization and polymerization at the two ﬁlaments ends differently ( Car - lier et al . 1997 ) . Its binding to F - actin causes the change in twists of the ﬁlaments ( McGough et al . 1997 ) . The coﬁlin – actin interaction is regulated by several factors including pH , phosphorylation / dephosphorylation , the type of nucleotide bound to actin , and phosphoinosi - tides ( Bamburg 1999 ) . Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation have been regarded as one of the major ways of regulation in vivo , which is achieved through signal cascades in the cytoplasm . Actin - binding ability of coﬁlin is inhibited by phosphorylation of the Ser residue ( Ser3 ) near the N - terminus of the molecule ( Agnew et al . 1995 ; Moriyama et al . 1996 ) . LIM - kinases ( LIMK ) ( Arber et al . 1998 ; Yang et al . 1998 ) and testis - speciﬁc kinases ( TESKS ) are involved in phosphorylation of coﬁlin , while dephosphorylation is caused by two types of phosphatases , Slingshot ( SSH ) ( Niwa et al . 2002 ) and Chronophin ( Gohla et al . 2005 ) . In cultured muscle cells , a large amount of the inactive , phosphorylated ADF has been detected ( Morgan et al . 1993 ) . Coﬁlin in cultured muscle cells also could be phosphorylated , but the relative proportion of the phos - phorylated form in differentiated muscle cells , myotubes , is much less than that in immature myogenic cells , myoblasts ( Ono et al . 1994 ) . Therefore , regulation of coﬁlin activity in muscle could not be totally attributed to the phosphor - ylation / dephosphorylation mechanism . It is known that phosphoinositides such as phosphati - dylinositol 4 , 5 - biphosphate ( PIP 2 ) inhibit actin - binding ability of coﬁlin , as well as several other actin - binding proteins , namely proﬁlin , gelsolin and CapZ ( Yonezawa et al . 1990 ; for reviews , see Bamburg 1999 and Janmey and Lindberg 2004 ) . PIP 2 - responsive sequences were detected in N - terminal ( Kusano et al . 1999 ) and C - terminal ( Yonezawa et al . 1991 ) sides of coﬁlin molecule . Recently , the phosphoinositide - binding site was mapped in the three dimensional structure of chicken coﬁlin molecule ( Gor - batyuk et al . 2006 ) . In our previous investigation , microinjection of recombinant coﬁlin into cultured muscle cells caused disruption of actin ﬁlaments coupled with rapid formation of cytoplasmic coﬁlin – actin rods , while such phenomena were suppressed by coinjection of PIP 2 together with coﬁlin ( Nagaoka et al . 1995 ) . Based on these observations , we have suggested that PIP 2 may function as a regulator for coﬁlin activity in muscle cells . In the present study , to further examine how coﬁlin activity is regulated in muscle cells , we introduced an unphosphorylatable form of coﬁlin ( A3 - coﬁlin ) , as well as the coﬁlin having Ser3 residue just as the wild - type coﬁlin , into cultured muscle cells by two different methods : pro - tein microinjection and cDNA transfection . Upon examination in cultured muscle cells , we found that inter - action of A3 - coﬁlin and S3 - coﬁlin with actin is suppressed in the cytoplasm , which strongly suggests that activity of coﬁlin can be regulated by a mechanism other than phos - phorylation / dephosphorylation in muscle cells in culture . Materials and methods Preparation of recombinant coﬁlin In the previous study ( Nagaoka et al . 1995 ) , by utilizing chicken coﬁlin cDNA ( pCMC - 16 ) ( Abe et al . 1990 ) , we prepared a coﬁlin molecule containing an additional hexapeptide ( MACGCA ) including two cysteine residues at the N - terminus , termed cys - coﬁlin , by manipulating chicken coﬁlin cDNA ( pCMC - 16 ) ( Abe et al . 1990 ) . The Ser3 residue of cys - coﬁlin was replaced with Ala ( A ) or Asp ( D ) , to prepare A3 - coﬁlin and D3 - coﬁlin , respectively , as described ( Nagaoka et al . 1996a ) . The cys - coﬁlin con - taining Ser3 ( termed S3 - coﬁlin in the following ) , A3 - coﬁlin and D3 - coﬁlin were obtained using an E . coli expression system with a pET - 3d vector ( NOVAGEN , WI , USA ) and puriﬁed as described previously ( Nagaoka et al . 1996a ) . Protein concentration was determined photomet - rically at 562 nm using a BCA kit ( PIERCE , IL , USA ) using bovine serum albumin as the standard . Preparation of ﬂuorescent conjugates The mutant coﬁlins ( A3 and D3 ) as well as the coﬁlin having Ser3 residue just as the wild - type coﬁlin ( S3 ) were 184 J Muscle Res Cell Motil ( 2007 ) 28 : 183 – 194 123 labeled with 5 - iodoacetamide - ﬂuorescein ( 5 - IAF ) , which is reactive to protein thiol groups , as described previously ( Nagaoka et al . 1996a ) . Brieﬂy , 5 - IAF dissolved in 0 . 5 M bicarbonate buffer ( pH 9 . 0 ) was added to coﬁlin in 0 . 1 M KCl and 20 mM Tris – HCl ( pH 8 . 3 ) at a molar ratio of 10 : 1 . The labeling reaction was continued for 6 h on ice and terminated by adding DTT to a ﬁnal concentration of 10 mM . The labeled coﬁlin was separated from the free dye by gel ﬁltration on a Sephadex G - 25 column that was equilibrated with an injection buffer composed of 0 . 1 M KCl and 10 mM HEPES – KOH , pH 7 . 0 . Cell culture Mononucleated myogenic cells of skeletal muscle were dissociated from breast muscles of 12 - day - old chicken embryos by means of mechanical dissociation ( Ii et al . 1982 ) and were plated on glass coverslips coated with collagen in 35 - mm tissue culture dishes at a density of 1 · 10 5 cells . The culture medium consisted of 81 % MEM ( Nissui , Tokyo ) supplemented with 2 mM L - glutamine , 15 % horse serum , and 4 % chick embryo extract . Cultures were maintained in a humidiﬁed atmosphere with 5 % CO 2 and 95 % air at 37 (cid:2) C . Microinjection and cDNA transfection Coﬁlin at the concentration of 1 . 8 mg / ml ( 94 l M ) was injected into cultured muscle cells with a micromanipulator ( Narishige , Tokyo ) as described previously ( Nagaoka et al . 1995 ) . The protein solutions were centrifuged at 100 , 000 g for 20 min just before use . Cells were ﬁxed and observed at 1 h or 8 h after the injection . In some cases , cells were treated with the medium containing 10 % DMSO for 1 h before ﬁxation . In order to construct expression vectors encoding S3 - coﬁlin - GFP , A3 - coﬁlin - GFP or D3 - coﬁlin - GFP , polymerase chain reaction was performed with the forward primers 5 0 - AAGAATTCGGGCACTATGGCATCTGGAGTTACAGT GAATG - 3 0 , 5 0 - AAGAATTCGG GCACTATGGCA GCTG GAGTTACAGTGAATG - 3 0 or 5 0 - AAGAATTCG GGCACT ATGGCAGATGGAGTTACAGTGAATG - 3 0 , respectively , and reverse primer 5 0 - AAGGATCCCTAGTGGCTTTCC TTCAAGGG - 3 0 using a mouse muscle - type coﬁlin cDNA ( Ono et al . 1994 ) as a template . Ampliﬁed DNA fragments were digested with Eco RI and Bam HI , and cloned into pEGFP - N2 ( CLONTECH , Palo Alto , CA , USA ) . The plas - mids were puriﬁed with an EndoFree Plasmid Maxi Kit ( QIAGEN K . K . , Tokyo , Japan ) . They were , then , transfected into cultured chicken myoblasts by a standard calcium phosphate precipitation method ( Graham and van der Eb , 1973 ) . Cells were incubated with the transfection mixture for 20 h , and transferred into the fresh culture medium . The myotubes were subjected to ﬁxation and immuno - staining , 4 or 6 days after transfection . Fluorescence microscopy Cells cultured on glass coverslips were ﬁxed with 4 % paraformaldehyde in PBS ( 0 . 15 M NaCl and 10 mM sodium phosphate , pH 7 . 0 ) for 20 min at room tempera - ture , and further ﬁxed and permeabilized with 100 % methanol for additional 5 min at – 20 (cid:2) C . The cultures were washed thoroughly with PBS and blocked with 1 % BSA in PBS for 1 h , followed by sequential reactions with an antibody speciﬁc for sarcomeric a - actin ( SkA - 06 ) ( Ha - yakawa et al . 1996 ) and rhodamine - goat anti - mouse IgG ( GAM ) for 1 h at room temperature . After washing with PBS , the cells were mounted with 50 % glycerol containing PBS and 10 mg / ml paraphenylenediamine . The specimens were examined with a Zeiss Axioskop with a cooled charge - coupled device camera , CoolSNAP ( Nippon ROPER , Chiba , Japan ) . By using excitation ﬁlters speciﬁc for ﬂuorescein or rhodamine ﬂuorescence , FITC - and rhodamine - images were speciﬁcally detected . Co - sedimentation assay The binding of recombinant coﬁlin to F - actin was examined by ultracentrifugation as described previously ( Nagaoka et al . 1995 ) . Actin was puriﬁed from rabbit skeletal muscle according to Spudich and Watt ( 1971 ) . Coﬁlin ( 4 l M ) and F - actin ( 4 l M ) were incubated in 0 . 1 M KCl , 0 . 1 mM DTT , 0 . 01 % NaN 3 and 20 mM Tris – HCl ( pH 8 . 3 ) or 20 mM HEPES – KOH ( pH 7 . 0 ) for 2 h at room temperature . To test the effect of PIP 2 on coﬁlin - actin interaction , coﬁlin ( 4 l M ) was incubated in the buffer solution with or without 400 l M PIP 2 ( Sigma , St . Louis , MO ) for 15 min at 25 (cid:2) C , followed by incu - bation with 4 l M of actin . We chose this PIP 2 concentration , because in the previous in vitro bio - chemical studies , the PIP 2 concentrations around 150 – 400 l M have been frequently used ( Nagaoka et al . 1995 ; Hirao et al . 1996 ) . The mixtures were then centrifuged at 386 , 000 g for 20 min and the resultant supernatant and pellet were examined by SDS - PAGE . Gel electrophoresis SDS - PAGE was carried out using a 12 . 5 or 15 % poly - acrylamide gel and a discontinuous Tris – glycine buffer system according to Laemmli ( 1970 ) . J Muscle Res Cell Motil ( 2007 ) 28 : 183 – 194 185 123 Dot blot assay Coﬁlin and BSA of 0 . 5 l g each were spotted on nitrocel - lulose membrane . The membrane was treated with 5 % skim milk in Tris - buffered saline ( TBS ) , washed with TBS , and then incubated with PIP 2 at the concentration of 2 mM or 290 l M in TBS for 30 min at room temperature . The membrane was incubated with antibodies to PIP 2 ( Fukami et al . 1988 ) for 1 h , followed by treatment with alkaline phosphatase ( AP ) - labeled second antibodies for 1 h , both at room temperature . Monoclonal antibody to C - protein ( C - 315 ) ( Kawashima et al . 1986 [ R1 ] ) was used as a control to check non - speciﬁc binding of immunoglobulin to the membrane and PIP 2 . After the immunoreaction , the mem - brane was washed with 0 . 1 M NaCl , 5 mM MgCl 2 , and 0 . 1 M Tris – HCl , pH 9 . 5 . The AP - labeled antibodies bound to the membrane were detected by incubation with a mixture of 5 - bromo - 4 - chloro - 3 - indolylphosphate p - tolui - dine salt ( BCIP ) and nitroblue tetrazolium chloride ( NBT ) . Results Regulation of the activity of recombinant coﬁlins that were introduced into cultured muscle cells by a microinjection method We produced chicken coﬁlin having Ser3 residue ( S3 - coﬁlin ) just as the wild - type coﬁlin , as well as two mutant coﬁlins in which Ser3 was replaced with Ala ( A3 - coﬁlin ) or with Asp ( D3 - coﬁlin ) , in an E . coli expression system and puriﬁed it as described by Nagaoka et al ( 1996a ) ( Fig . 1 ) . The recombinant coﬁlins generated in our system have additional 6 amino acids containing two cysteine residues at their amino - terminus ( Nagaoka et al . 1995 ) . In order to examine the location of coﬁlin in the cytoplasm of muscle cells , the recombinant coﬁlins were labeled with 5 - iodoacetamide - ﬂuorescein ( 5 - IAF ) . Native coﬁlin was scarcely labeled with this dye unless it was denatured by urea , although two cysteine residues are present in a coﬁlin molecule as previously described ( Nagaoka et al . 1995 ) . We previously conﬁrmed that these S3 - coﬁlin and A3 - coﬁlin , but not D3 - coﬁlin , interacted with F - actin in test tubes regardless of labeling or non - labeling with 5 - IAF by a co - precipitation assay ( Nagaoka et al . 1996a ) . The recombinant coﬁlins prepared in this study also showed similar functional activity in test tubes ( Data not shown ) . Thus , 5 - IAF targets only the extra Cys residues at the N - terminus without decreasing the activity of coﬁlin . The recombinant coﬁlins labeled with 5 - IAF were introduced into chicken myotubes of primary culture by the microinjection method at the concentration of 1 . 8 mg / ml . For this purpose , myotubes at 3 days of culture were used , when stress - ﬁber - like structures , or premyoﬁbrils , were present but well - developed sarcomeric myoﬁbrils had not been formed yet . Endogenous coﬁlin was mostly diffused in the cytoplasm without associating with any particular ﬁlamentous structures . The recombinant S3 - , A3 - and D3 - coﬁlins that were introduced into the myotubes were dif - fused throughout the cytoplasm of myotubes as seen in Fig . 4a . When S3 - coﬁlin was introduced into the myotubes , it was diffused in the cytoplasm and many small rods that were composed of actin and S3 - coﬁlin were formed throughout the cytoplasm within less than 1 h , consistent with previously reports ( Nagaoka et al . 1995 ) ( Fig . 2a and b ) . However , such rod structures completely disappeared from the cytoplasm in 5 – 8 h after injection of the protein . S3 - coﬁlin was detected throughout the cytoplasm and actin ﬁlament bundles were observed in these cells ( Fig . 2c and d ) , conﬁrming that S3 - coﬁlin became inactive in muscle cells ( Nagaoka et al . 1995 ) . When A3 - coﬁlin was injected into young myotubes , actin ﬁlaments were completely disrupted , and many rod structures that were composed of actin and coﬁlin were generated in the cytoplasm of the myotubes ( Fig . 3a and b ) . In several hours , however , A3 - coﬁlin - actin rods disap - peared . A3 - coﬁlin was detected in a diffused pattern and actin ﬁlaments were recovered ( see Fig . 3c and d ) . This observation indicates that even in the absence of Ser3 residue responsible for phosphorylation in A3 - coﬁlin , the activity of A3 - coﬁlin was suppressed . A3 - coﬁlin had not been degraded or irreversibly inactivated during this cul - ture period , because treatment of these myotubes by Fig . 1 Expression and puriﬁcation of recombinant coﬁlins with 6 amino acids containing 2 cysteines at their N - terminus ; S3 - coﬁlin ( S3 ) , A3 - coﬁlin ( A3 ) , and D3 - coﬁlin ( D3 ) . The whole lysate of E . coli treated with IPTG to induce coﬁlin expression ( a ) and puriﬁed recombinant coﬁlins ( b ) were analyzed by SDS - PAGE with 15 % polyacrylamide gel . The SDS - PAGE pattern of the lysate of E . coli without the coﬁlin - expression vector is also demonstrated ( mock ) . M , molecular weight markers with their size indicated on the left side 186 J Muscle Res Cell Motil ( 2007 ) 28 : 183 – 194 123 DMSO reactivated A3 - coﬁlin and thereby , coﬁlin - actin rods were observed to have reformed ( see arrows in Fig . 3e and f ) . These results deﬁnitely show that the activity of A3 - coﬁlin must be regulated by some mechanism other than phosphorylation and dephosphorylation . Injection of D3 - coﬁlin , an analogue of phosphorylated coﬁlin , caused neither disruption of actin ﬁlaments nor formation of actin / coﬁlin rods in myotubes not only soon after injection ( Fig . 4a and b ) and also 8 h after injection ( Fig . 4c and d ) . Thus , D3 - coﬁlin was inactive in the cytoplasm of myotubes . This is quite reasonable since D3 - coﬁlin did not interact with F - actin in test tubes ( Nagaoka et al . 1996a ) . Regulation of the activity of mutant coﬁlins that were expressed in cultured muscle cells The recombinant coﬁlins introduced into the cultured cells by a microinjetion method included extra Cys residues that were labeled by ﬂuorescence dye at the N - terminal side . Since the activity of coﬁlin is regulated by phosphoryla - tion / dephsophorylation of a single Ser residue near the N - terminus , the extra Cys residues at the N - terminus and their labeling with ﬂuorescence might modulate coﬁlin activity . To avoid this possibility , we prepared cDNA constructs for S3 - coﬁlin , A3 - coﬁlin and D3 - coﬁlin molecules having a ﬂuorescence probe ( GFP ) at their C - terminus . The cDNAs were introduced into cultured muscle cells by a cDNA transfection method and the localization patterns of the coﬁlin valiants were examined under a ﬂuorescence microscope . As shown in Fig . 5a and b , S3 - coﬁlin - GFP formed distinct rod structures with actin ( coﬁlin - actin rods ) in the cytoplasm at early stages of culture , namely 4 day - culture , after cDNA transfection . Afterward , however , the rod structures disappeared , although the coﬁlin - GFP con - centration was maintained in a high level in the cytoplasm as judged by the ﬂuorescence intensity ( Fig . 5c and d ) , suggesting that coﬁlin activity was suppressed by some endogenous regulatory mechanisms . A3 - coﬁlin - GFP that was produced by the cDNA transfection also formed coﬁlin - actin rods in the cytoplasm initially , as shown in Fig . 6a and b , and again they disappeared later , even though the A3 - coﬁlin - GFP was abundantly detected in the cytoplasm ( Fig . 6c and d ) . This observation indicates that the activity of A3 - coﬁlin was suppressed by some endog - enous regulatory mechanisms other than phosphorylation of Ser3 . D3 - coﬁlin - GFP generated from the cDNA never formed coﬁlin - actin rods in the cytoplasm ( Fig . 7 ) in par - allel to the results of the recombinant D3 - coﬁlin introduced by a microinjection method ( Fig . 4 ) . Suppression of actin – coﬁlin interaction by PIP 2 in vitro It has been reported that phosphoinositides , especially PIP 2 , bind to coﬁlin and thereby inhibit the interaction between actin and coﬁlin ( Yonezawa et al . 1990 ) . We examined whether the interaction of A3 - coﬁlin and S3 - coﬁlin with F - actin is inhibited by PIP 2 by a co - precipitation assay . As Fig . 2 Effects of S3 - coﬁlin microinjection on actin ﬁlaments in cultured muscle cells . The cells were injected with 5 - IAF - S3 - coﬁlin ( 1 . 8 mg / ml ) , ﬁxed and stained with anti - actin antibody 1 h ( a , b ) or 8 h ( c , d ) after the injection , and then treated with rhodamine - GAM .

Bar : 10 l m 188 J Muscle Res Cell Motil ( 2007 ) 28 : 183 – 194 123 shown in Fig . 8b , at neutral pH , both A3 - coﬁlin and S3 - coﬁlin were mostly precipitated together with actin by ultra - centrifugation , while they were not precipitated in the absence of actin ( Fig . 8a ) , showing that both coﬁlins made a complex with F - actin . At pH 8 . 3 , roughly 50 % of total coﬁlin , not only S3 - coﬁlin but also A3 - coﬁlin , was pre - cipitated together with actin . Considerable amounts of the coﬁlins and also actin can be expected to remain in the supernatants at pH 8 . 3 , since actin - depolymerizing activity and F - actin severing activity of coﬁlin is enhanced at alkaline pH . In contrast , in the presence of PIP 2 , neither A3 - coﬁlin nor S3 - coﬁlin was precipitated at both neutral and alkaline pH ranges , while actin was mostly precipitated ( Fig . 8c ) . Therefore , it is evident that PIP 2 functioned as an inhibitor to suppress the activity of both A3 - coﬁlin and S3 - coﬁlin . It should also be noted that D3 - coﬁlin was not precipitated with actin irrespective of the presence or absence of PIP 2 ( Data not shown ) . These results suggest that in muscle cells , inositol phosphates could be involved in the regulation of coﬁlin activity , or in the other words , in the regulation of actin assembly .

The mixture was incubated for 2 h at room temperature and then centrifuged at 386 , 000 g for 20 min . The resultant supernatants ( S ) and precipitates ( P ) were subjected to SDS - PAGE . Top panel ( a ) : actin ( Act ) , S3 - coﬁlin ( S3 ) , or A3 - coﬁlin ( A3 ) alone was centrifuged . Bottom panel : Mixture of actin and S3 - coﬁlin ( Act + S3 ) or mixture of actin and A3 - coﬁlin ( Act + A3 ) was incubated in the absence ( Left panel : b ) or in the presence ( Right panel : b ) of PIP 2 and then centrifuged .

These control protein and control antibody did not show any positive signal at all under the same condition . Discussion We have previously demonstrated that the increase of coﬁlin amount in muscle cells leads to the generation of rod structures that are composed of coﬁlin and actin in the cytoplasm ( Nagaoka et al . 1995 : Ono et al . 1996 ) . Direct injection of active recombinant coﬁlin into muscle cells rapidly generates coﬁlin - actin rods . Coﬁlin - actin rod formation depends on a variety of cytoplasmic conditions , namely the level of coﬁlin accu - mulation ( Nagaoka et al . 1995 ) , ATP depletion ( Bershadsky et al . 1980 ; Minamide et al . 2000 ) , osmotic stress ( Iida and Yahara 1986 ) , heat shock ( Ohta et al . 1989 ) and stimulation by chemical agents such as DMSO ( Nishida et al . 1987 ; Ohta et al . 1989 ; Ono et al . 1996 ) . In all cases , active coﬁlin is required for rod formation . Since coﬁlin becomes activated by dephosphorylation , one pos - sible mechanism for triggering reorganization of actin to generate coﬁlin – actin rods or to diminish the structures is activation or inactivation of coﬁlin through its dephos - phorylation or phosphorylation . Actually , it has been reported that dephosphorylation of coﬁlin is caused by heat shock , treatments with DMSO ( Ohta et al . 1989 ) , or inhibitors of myosin light chain kinase ( MLCK ) ( Baorto et al . 1992 ) . Active coﬁlin at high concentration may enhance actin dynamics in the cytoplasm through processes including removal of tropomyosin from actin ﬁlaments , disassembly of actin ﬁlaments , production of a large G - actin pool , and exchange of nucleotides bound to G - actin . Recently , it has been demonstrated that high concentration of coﬁlin nucleate actin polymerization ( Andrianantoandro and Pollard 2006 ) . Therefore , coﬁlin bound actin ﬁlaments seem to be enriched in the cytoplasm when concentration of active coﬁlin is elevated and , subsequently , actin ﬁla - ments may get together to form the actin – coﬁlin rods . In the present study , we used the ability to form the coﬁlin – actin rods as a marker to assess whether coﬁlin is in an active state in the cytoplasm . Detailed molecular mechanisms for rod formation have not yet been well elucidated . Some factors in addition to coﬁlin and actin might be involved in formation and / or diminution of the rods . Nevertheless , active coﬁlin is required for the rod formation and inactive coﬁlin cannot be assembled in the rods . Therefore , rod - forming activity could be a barometer of active coﬁlin . With an aim to examine the regulation of coﬁlin activity by mechanisms other than phosphorylation / dephosphorylation in muscle cells , we prepared A3 - coﬁlin ( an analogue of dephosphorylated coﬁlin ) , D3 - coﬁlin ( an analogue of phosphorylated coﬁlin ) , and S3 - coﬁlin as recombinant proteins as described previously ( Nagaoka et al . 1996a ) . They were labeled with a ﬂuorescent dye at the N - terminus , with no effects on coﬁlin activity ( Nagaoka et al . 1995 ) and introduced into cultured muscle cells by a microinjection method . This method is excellent for quickly increasing coﬁlin concentration and the coﬁlin concentration we used is known to be sufﬁcient for inducing formation of cytoplasmic coﬁlin – actin rods promptly in muscle cells ( Nagaoka et al . 1995 ) . In muscle cells , both S3 - coﬁlin and A3 - coﬁlin , but not D3 - coﬁlin , generated the rods immediately after the injection into cultured muscle cells . Unexpectedly , the ability of A3 - coﬁlin to form the rods was suppressed several hours after injection similar to that of S3 - coﬁlin . Since A3 - coﬁlin is an unphosphorylatable form of coﬁlin , some mechanism ( s ) other than phosphorylation must have suppressed A3 - coﬁlin activity . It is to be noted that A3 - coﬁlin and S3 - coﬁlin that were labeled with a ﬂuorescent dye at the C - terminus gave basically the same results as those labeled Fig . 9 Binding of PIP 2 to coﬁlin . S3 - coﬁlin ( a – c ) , A3 - coﬁlin ( d – f ) , D3 - coﬁlin ( g – i ) and BSA ( j – l ) , 0 . 5 l g each , were spotted on nitrocellulose membrane , and then incubated with PIP 2 at the concentration of 2 mM ( a , c , d , f , g , i , j , l ) or 290 l M ( b , e , h , k ) . PIP 2 bound to the proteins was detected with anti PIP 2 - antibody ( a , b , d , e , g , h , j , k ) . In ( c , f , i , l ) , monoclonal antibody to C - protein ( anti - Cpro ) was used as a control to detect non - speciﬁc binding of immunoglobulin to the proteins or PIP 2 J Muscle Res Cell Motil ( 2007 ) 28 : 183 – 194 191 123 at the N - terminus ( data not shown ) . In the case of increasing coﬁlin amounts in muscle cells by cDNA transfection , GFP was fused to the C - terminus of coﬁlin by cDNA manipulation , as the phosphorylation site ( Ser3 ) of coﬁlin that is involved in the regulation of coﬁlin activity is located near the N - terminus . In the cDNA transfection method , several days were needed to observe the formation of the cytoplasmic rods for technical reasons ; that is , the myoblasts with the cDNAs encoding coﬁlin - GFP took 2 – 3 days to form myotubes followed by a gradual accumulation of coﬁlin in the cytoplasm . Nevertheless , A3 - coﬁlin - GFP , as well as S3 - coﬁlin - GFP , generated the actin – coﬁlin rods initially but these rod structures eventually were dimin - ished , as observed in the case of the rod formation in the microinjection of recombinant coﬁlin . We do not think that coﬁlin – actin rods disappeared as the result of decrease in coﬁlin concentration rather than inactivation of coﬁlin by the following reasons . ( 1 ) Injec - tion of the exogenous coﬁlin into myotubes enhanced coﬁlin concentration in the cytoplasm up to roughly 15 l M , three times higher than that of endogenous coﬁlin , and the coﬁlin introduced was already spread throughout the cytoplasm while actin – coﬁlin rods were present . Therefore , the coﬁlin concentration around the rods might not be decreased by further diffusion in the cytoplasm . ( 2 ) When de novo synthesis of coﬁlin in myotubes was sup - pressed by the treatment with an inhibitor of protein synthesis such as cycloheximide , coﬁlin concentration in the cytoplasm decreased gradually but the decrease at 8 h after the treatment was estimated as being less than 20 % ( unpublished data ) . Even if such decrease occurred , resid - ual coﬁlin concentration should be around 12 l M that is sufﬁcient for rod formation ( Nagaoka et al . 1995 ) . ( 3 ) Coﬁlin was clearly detectable throughout the cytoplasm of myotubes by anti - coﬁlin antibody even after disappearance of the rods , indicating that coﬁlin was present in a signif - icant level . ( 4 ) DMSO - induced quick re - formation of coﬁlin – actin rods in the cytoplasm where the rods became undetectable conﬁrmed that coﬁlin amount in the myotubes remained in a level sufﬁcient for generation of the rods . Without the elevated coﬁlin concentration , only nuclear coﬁlin – actin rods are generated in the myotubes in place of cytoplasmic rods by DMSO - stimulation ( Ono et al . 1993 ; Abe et al . 1993 ) . According to our previous study , coﬁlin was mostly detected as a dephosphorylated form in differentiated myotubes ( Ono et al . 1994 ) , suggesting that coﬁlin kinase activity may be decreased and / or the active coﬁlin pho - phatase may be abundant in the myotubes . If coﬁlin activity is solely regulated by the phophorylation / dephos - phorylation mechanism , coﬁlin synthesized in differentiated muscle cells must be maintained in an active state . Contrary to this view , our current results , particularly the diminishing of actin - A3 - coﬁlin rods in the cytoplasm , indicate that activity of coﬁlin must be suppressed by a mechanism other than phosphorylation in muscle cells in culture . It is known that phosphoinositides , such as PIP 2 , PIP and PI , bind to coﬁlin and inhibit coﬁlin – actin inter - action in vitro ( Yonezawa et al . 1990 ) . Additionally , injection of PIP 2 together with coﬁlin into myotubes sup - presses activity of coﬁlin in the cytoplasm ( Nagaoka et al . 1995 ) . We observed that not only S3 - coﬁlin but also A3 - coﬁlin and D3 - coﬁlin possessed the ability to bind to PIP 2 , and PIP 2 inhibited the interaction of A3 - coﬁlin , as well as S3 - coﬁlin , with actin . Therefore , it is conceivable that phosphoinositides could function as an inhibitor of coﬁlin – actin interaction in the cytoplasm of muscle cells . Recently , it has been reported that resting metastatic carcinoma cells have the majority of their coﬁlin in a dephosphorylated but largely inactive state and this coﬁlin inactivation seemed to be achieved by binding of PIP 2 to coﬁlin ( Song et al . 2006 ) . Thus , the mechanism of regu - lating coﬁlin function through its binding to phosphoinositides is important in both muscle and non - muscle cells . A matter of particular interest is how the interaction of phosphoinositides with coﬁlin changes in cytoplasm when dynamic reorganization of actin is initi - ated to form coﬁlin – actin rods in muscle cells . Currently , two possible mechanisms for regulation of PIP 2 - bound coﬁlin have been presented . One mechanism is the acti - vation through hydrolysis of the bound PIP 2 by phospholipase C c , which becomes functional only when activated by phosphorylation on tyrosine , as occurs upon signal transduction through receptor tyrosine kinases that is activated by EGF stimulation ( Goldschmidt - Clermont et al . 1991 ; Mouneimne et al . 2004 ) . The other mechanism is the activation by the PIP 2 phosphatase , synaptojanin . This enzyme is targeted to the activated EGF receptor in cells by the adapter protein Ash / GRB2 and can hydrolyze PIP 2 bound to proteins ( Sakisaka et al . 1997 ) . Yet , little is known as to how the PIP 2 - bound coﬁlin in muscle cells can be regulated by either of these mechanisms . It is known that the interaction of active coﬁlin with actin could be modulated in the cytoplasm by a variety of factors ( Bamburg 1999 ; Ono 2003 ) . Therefore , we cannot neglect the possibility that some unidentiﬁed factor ( s ) might be involved in the regulation of the interaction of active coﬁlin and actin in the cultured muscle cells . Myosin and tropomyosin could be one of the possible regulators to modulate coﬁlin – actin interaction in muscle cytoplasm . Myosin is known to work as an inhibitor of coﬁlin – actin interaction in vitro ( Abe and Obinata 1989 ) . We have also demonstrated that suppression of myosin – actin interaction by 2 , 3 - butanedione monoxime ( BDM ) induced disassem - bly of actin ﬁlaments in coﬁlin - transfected cells , suggesting that myosin activity may be involved in the regulation of 192 J Muscle Res Cell Motil ( 2007 ) 28 : 183 – 194 123 coﬁlin – actin interaction in vivo ( Ono et al . 1996 ) . In young developing muscle cells , the amount of myosin is compa - rably less than that of actin , but as muscle develops , molar ratio of myosin to actin increases remarkably ( Obinata and Abe 1991 ) . Therefore , the effects of coﬁlin on actin ﬁla - ments might be decreased as myoﬁbrillogenesis progresses . Even so , coﬁlin – actin interaction could not be steadily suppressed by myosin , possibly due to dynamic changes of myosin – actin interaction . In an in vitro assay , tropomyosin is known to compete with coﬁlin and ADF for F - actin binding and it protects F - actin from disassembly by these proteins ( Nishida et al . 1984 ; Bernstein and Bamburg , 1982 ) . In developing mus - cle cells in culture , both tropomyosin and troponin began to be detected along actin ﬁlaments in early stages of myo - ﬁbrillogenesis as in sarcomeres of differentiated muscle cells by immunoelectron microscopy ( Obinata et al . 1979 ) . Yet , coﬁlin was detected in a periodic pattern in association with I - band regions of myoﬁbrils in cultured muscle cells , as well as in mature muscle cells in vivo ( Nakashima et al . 2005 ) . Therefore , it is suggested that the inhibitory effect of tropomyosin on coﬁlin – actin interaction in muscle cells may not be so prominent and it changes little during muscle development . Another inhibitor of coﬁlin – actin interaction , a calponin - related protein ( UNC - 87 ) , has been recently characterized in striated muscle of C . elegans ( Yamashiro et al . 2007 ) . Therefore , it is of interest whether the homologue of this protein may play some role in vertebrate skeletal muscle cells .
