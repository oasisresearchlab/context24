In the recent past , the toolbox of ﬂuorescence microscopy has been extended by a number of novel super - resolution methods with enhanced spatial resolution ( Betzig et al . , 2006 ; Dedecker et al . , 2007 ; Gustafsson , 2000 ; Heilemann , 2010 ; Heilemann et al . , 2009 , 2008 ; Hell , 2007 ; Hell and Wichmann , 1994 ; Hess et al . , 2006 ; Rust etal . , 2006 ; Steinhaueretal . , 2008 ) . Methodsthatusephotoswitch - able ﬂuorophores and single - molecule localization modulate the ﬂuorescenceemissionintime , andcanbecategorizedintotwocon - cepts . The ﬁrst concept relies on photoactivation and read - out of a single ﬂuorophore only once , such as in photoactivation localiza - tion microscopy , e . g . PALM ( Betzig et al . , 2006 ; Hess et al . , 2006 ) or NASCA ( nanometer accuracy by stochastic catalytic reactions microscopy ) ( Roeffaers et al . , 2009 ) . The second concept explores the reversible formation of stable non - ﬂuorescent states of organic ﬂuorophores ( e . g . STORM , d STORM , GSDIM ) ( Folling et al . , 2008 ; Heilemann et al . , 2008 ; Rust et al . , 2006 ; van de Linde et al . , 2008a ; Vogelsang et al . , 2009 ) or ﬂuorescent proteins like Dronpa ( Flors et al . , 2007 ) . ∗ Corresponding authors .

Organic ﬂuorophores suited for super - resolution imaging must fulﬁll a number of requirements . First , they need to have a bright ﬂuorescent “on” - state , providing a high photon yield for pre - cise single - molecule localization ( Thompson et al . , 2002 ) . Second , the off - state should be essentially non - ﬂuorescent and possess a long lifetime to ensure that the majority of ﬂuorophores remains non - ﬂuorescent and only a very small subset of ﬂuorophores is active in a densely labeled sample at any time . Finally , the tran - sition between the ﬂuorescent and non - ﬂuorescent state should be reversibleandideallybeeasilycontrolledbyexternalexperimental parameters , such as the irradiation intensity or redox properties of the buffer . Carbocyanine derivatives like Cy5 or Alexa647 were the ﬁrst photoswitchable organic dyes used for super - resolution microscopy ( Rust et al . , 2006 ) . Photoswitching of carbocyanines can be performed with ( Bates et al . , 2005 ) or without a second activator dye ( Heilemann et al . , 2005 ) , where the activator facil - itates photoswitching of the carbocyanine dye ( the formation of the ﬂuorescent form ) on the one hand , but requires complex dual - labeling of the probes on the other hand . Both approaches were used successfully for super - resolution imaging , i . e . for stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy ( STORM ) ( Rust et al . , 2006 ) and for direct STORM ( d STORM ) ( Heilemann et al . , 2008 ) . The underly - ing photoswitching mechanism requires oxygen removal and the addition of a thiol - compound such as (cid:2) - mercaptoethylamine ( typ - ically 50 – 100mM ) and physiological pH values ( Heilemann et al . , 2005 ) . 0168 - 1656 / $ – see front matter © 2010 Elsevier B .

Here , the photoswitching mechanism is slightly different : the presence of oxygen is tolerated and used to transfer the non - ﬂuorescent to the ﬂuorescent state by oxidation , respectively , and only a millimolar concentration of a reducing agent such as dithiothreitol ( DTT ) , glutathione ( GSH ) , or mercaptoethylamine ( MEA ) inthebufferisadded ( Heilemannetal . , 2009 ; van de Linde et al . , 2009 ) . In consideration of the fact that the tripeptide GSH is the most abundant low - molecular weight protec - tant and antioxidant ( reducing agent ) in mammalian biology and present in animal cells in the reduced state at millimolar concen - trations ( Sies , 1999 ) , d STORM can be performed even in living cells with selected small organic ﬂuorophores ( Heilemann et al . , 2009 ) . The procedure for single - molecule based localization microscopy is similar in all concepts developed so far . A target structure is densely labeled with photoswitchable ﬂuorophores , and the majority of ﬂuorophores is transferred to the non - ﬂuorescent state . In the case of photoactivatable ﬂuorescent proteins , the sample is essentially non - ﬂuorescent prior to activa - tion . If organic ﬂuorophores are used , the majority of ﬂuorophores has to be converted to a metastable dark state upon irradiation with light . During the actual experiment , only a subset of single emitters is switched on stochastically per image . At any time the density of activated ﬂuorophores should be low enough to allow the isolated localization of individual ﬂuorophores , i . e . the distance to the next neighbor should be larger than the resolution limit . The position of every ﬂuorophore is determined by approximating the point - spread function ( PSF ) to a two - dimensional Gaussian function . Activation and localization is repeated many times , and a ﬁnal image with superior resolution is reconstructed from all single - molecule positions determined . Here , a lateral resolution of 20 – 40nm is commonly achieved experimentally ( Folling et al . , 2008 ; Heilemann et al . , 2009 , 2008 ; Rust et al . , 2006 ; Vogelsang et al . , 2009 ; Wolter et al . , 2010 ) . 2 . Results and discussion Photoswitching microscopy according to the d STORM concept requires ﬂuorophores that can be reversibly switched between a ﬂuorescenton - andanon - ﬂuorescentoff - state ( darkstate ) ( Fig . 1A ) . In order to exploit this photoswitching for single - molecule local - ization , the ﬂuorescence emission of individual ﬂuorophores has to be separated in time . In case of a densely labeled structure , the dark state should exhibit a lifetime (cid:2) off that is substantially longer than the lifetime of the ﬂuorescent state (cid:2) on . Ideally , the lifetime of the on - state (cid:2) on should be very short , with a high photon yield in order to allow precise localization ( Thompson et al . , 2002 ) . Upon irra - diation the ﬂuorophore is transferred to a metastable dark state at a rate k off , where it resides until it is converted to the singlet ground state with rate k on . We deﬁne the ratio of these rates as r : = k off / k on = (cid:2) off / (cid:2) on . Here it has to be pointed out that the lifetime of the off - state directly controls the achievable optical resolution . Off - state life - times have been reported to vary from 10 to 100ms ( Folling et al . , 2008 ; Steinhauer et al . , 2008 ) to several seconds ( Bates et al . , 2005 ; Heilemann et al . , 2005 ; van de Linde et al . , 2008a ) . For relatively unstable off - states with short (cid:2) off high irradiation intensities have to be applied to reduce (cid:2) on and to generate a sufﬁcient ratio r , e . g . r = 100 for (cid:2) on = 1ms and (cid:2) off = 100ms . In the case of dark state life - times in the range of seconds a sufﬁcient high rate - ratio r can be achieved with comparably long on - times ( and corresponding low irradiation intensity ) . In addition , r can be further optimized apply - ing a higher irradiation intensity . Thus , (cid:2) on decreases and enables higher imaging speed . This has the additional advantage that other Fig . 1 . Regular localizations vs . multiple - ﬂuorophore localizations of photoswitch - able ﬂuorophores . ( A ) A photoswitchable ﬂuorophore can be cycled between a ﬂuorescent “on” - and a non - ﬂuorescent “off” - state . The ﬂuorescence intensity tra - jectory ideally exhibits off - times which are substantially longer than the on - times . ( B ) Inthecaseofregularlocalizations , theemissionoftwoormorephotoswitchable ﬂuorophores within the diffraction - limited area is temporally separated . The local - izationsrepresenttheactualpositionoftheﬂuorophoresonthestructure . ( C ) Inthe case of multiple - ﬂuorophore localizations , two ( or more ) ﬂuorophores are ﬂuores - cent at the same time and recorded in one point - spread function ( PSF ) . In practice , this can happen when switching rates are set inappropriately . The approximation of the PSF of multiple emitters yields a position that does not correspond to the physical position of any of the ﬂuorophores . If the ﬂuorophores are arranged along a single ﬁlament ( upper case ) , the mismatch has no consequences on the resolu - tionenhancement . Incaseoftwoadjacentﬂuorophoresondifferent , e . g . parallel , or crossing ﬁlaments ( lower case ) , a false localization is generated and will affect the ability to resolve the independent ﬁlaments . effectssuchasmechanicaldriftsarereducedandbecomesinpartic - ular important when dynamic processes are observed ( Endesfelder et al . , 2010 ) . The denser a structure is labeled with photoswitch - able ﬂuorophores , the higher the ratio r has to be in order to ensure that ﬂuorescence emission of single ﬂuorophores is temporally well separated to allow unambiguous localization of individual emitters . In this context , the Nyquist – Shannon sampling theorem becomes important , which requires that the average distance between neighboring molecules must be at least half of the desired resolution ( Shannon , 1949 ; Shroff et al . , 2008 ) . Therefore , next to the localization precision of single emitters which is governed by the photons emitted ( Thompson et al . , 2002 ) , the achievable res - olution is controlled by the labeling density . In the extreme case the density of photoswitchable ﬂuorophores can become so high that the photophysical parameters (cid:2) on and (cid:2) off reach their limit and photobleaching must be applied to achieve the required ﬂu - orophore density . Alternatively , the number of ﬂuorophore labels ( e . g . antibodies ) can be reduced . However , both strategies go at the expense of optical resolution according to the Nyquist – Shannon sampling theorem . It has already been demonstrated that off - state lifetimes in the lower millisecond range , e . g . 60ms for the radical anion of Cy5 in the absence of oxygen with a corresponding rate - ratio of up to 60 enables 100nm Nyquist limited two - dimensional resolution ( Steinhauer et al . , 2008 ) . Higher ﬂuorophore densities allow for 262 S . van de Linde et al . / Journal of Biotechnology 149 ( 2010 ) 260 – 266 higher resolution but require higher rate - ratios r with very long off - lifetimes of the non - ﬂuorescent off - state . Under appropriate conditions the majority of ﬂuorophores residing in their ﬂuorescent on - state will be identiﬁed and local - ized as single molecules during data analysis . Such localizations will be termed “regular localization” in the following ( Fig . 1B ) . Yet in some cases , it can happen that more than one ﬂuorophore is ﬂu - orescent at the same time in a diffraction - limited area because of the stochastic nature of the switching process or due to inappropri - ate photoswitching conditions ( Fig . 1C ) . In cases where more than one ﬂuorophore contribute , the shape of the PSF becomes asym - metric which results in “irregular spots” that are usually sorted out during software analysis ( for details see Section 4 ) . However , if two or more ﬂuorophores are very close , the asymmetry in shape might be too small to be distinguished from single - molecule spots . Similarly , the ﬂuorescence intensity does not report reliably on the number of ﬂuorophores present in a diffraction - limited area . Con - sequently they are ﬁtted as one spot whose localization does not reﬂect the physical position of a single ﬂuorophore anymore . These localizations are called “multiple - ﬂuorophore localizations” in the following ( Fig . 1C ) . To demonstrate the power of super - resolution microscopy it is very common to choose cellular polymers like the microtubule or actin skeleton in ﬁxed cells . Both ﬁlaments have diameters well belowthediffractionlimitaswellasalargenumberofbindingsites for antibodies or other drug molecules , which can be labeled with photoswitchableﬂuorophores . However , underrealisticconditions super - resolution imaging should not only show linear ﬁlaments that can be easily resolved irrespective of the rate - ratio r . The error rate due to multiple - ﬂuorophore localizations becomes noticeable when not only a single isolated ﬁlament has to be super - resolved but rather a network of crossing and adjacent ﬁlaments . Further - more , when using ﬂuorophore labeled antibodies as probes , the degree of labeling ( DOL ) has to be considered because a DOL > 1 reduces the off - time of the label . According to a binominal distribu - tion for a sufﬁcient low ( and realistic in terms of antibody labeling ) DOL ( 2 - 6 ) andhigherrate - ratios ( r > 50 ) , r isapproximatelyreduced to an effective rate - ratio r / DOL . Theissueofresolvingstraight , single , andwellisolatedﬁlaments is rather simple . It does not matter whether a single ﬂuorophore or an undistinguishable pair of ﬂuorophores is ﬁtted . Anytime when a multiple - ﬂuorophore localization is made along the ﬁlament , it contributes to the artiﬁcial reconstructed image in the same way as every regular localization ( Fig . 1B and C ) . In this case the localiza - tion does not reﬂect the position of a single ﬂuorophore anymore but it does not affect the resolution of the structure . Therefore , the rate - ratio r can be relatively small and also short - lived off - states of standard organic ﬂuorophores can be used under high excitation conditions for super - resolution imaging ( Baddeley et al . , 2009 ) . The resolution of crossing or adjacent ﬁlaments , however , requires a higher r and a stable non - ﬂuorescent state with a comparably long lifetime (cid:2) off , respectively because of the higher ﬂuorophore density ( Fig . 2 ) . Localizing more than one ﬂuorophore within a diffraction - limited area affects the resolution of the struc - ture as it yields coordinates where actually no ﬂuorophore resides . InFig . 2A , straightﬁlamentsweresimulatedusingdifferent r values with an interﬂuorophore distance of 8 . 5nm predicting a theoret - ical resolution of 17nm ( Shannon , 1949 ) .

Everyﬁlamentconsistsofaline labeled with a ﬂuorophore every 8 . 5nm . The simulated photoswitching properties are based on the experimental data of the photoswitchable ﬂuorophore Cy5 assuming 1000 photons detected from each ﬂuorophore . The network was resolved for different r = k off / k on . ( B ) Cross - section proﬁles of three different ﬁlament pairs with distances of 50 , 100 , and 300nm ; within a structure the ratio required to resolve the ﬁlaments increases with the complexity of organization , i . e . the denser a diffraction - limited area is labeled with photoswitchable ﬂuorophores the higher the ratio has to be . A low ratio of r = 33 sufﬁces to resolve single ﬁlaments with large distances ( 300nm ) , whereas ﬁlaments with smaller distances or crossing areas need higher ratios . ( C ) Cross - section proﬁles with normalized intensity showing that double spot localizations can lead to artiﬁcial ﬁlaments . S . van de Linde et al . / Journal of Biotechnology 149 ( 2010 ) 260 – 266 263 ﬁlamentswithneighbordistancesof50 , 100 , and300nmweresim - ulated ( Fig . 2A ) . Thus , theﬂuorophoredensityofthestructurevaries between88and176ﬂuorophoresperdiffraction - limitedarea . Pho - toswitching parameters used in the simulation were derived from experimental values derived from carbocyanine dyes ( see Section 4 ) . In case of low switching rates ( r = 33 ; Fig . 2C ) , adjacent ﬁlaments with distances of 50 and 100nm are not resolvable and crossing ﬁl - aments are blurred completely ( r = 33 , 100 ) . With increasing ratio ( r = 300 , 1000 ) adjacentaswellascrossingﬁlamentscanberesolved clearly . As can be seen on the amplitudes shown in Fig . 2B for high r , the majority of localizations are made from single - molecules , whereas for low rate - ratios most of the ﬂuorophores lead to irreg - ular spots . These spots are sorted out automatically due to their asymmetry during software analysis . Hence , for lower ratios the total number of localizations which contribute to the ﬁnal d STORM image is reduced . A close look at cross - sections of adjacent ﬁlaments highlights the impact of multiple - ﬂuorophore localizations ( Fig . 2C ) . At low switching rates , when the majority of spots do not originate from single molecules , the localizations are predominantly allocated between two ﬁlaments . This is very distinctive for short distances ( 50nm ) , with the consequence that a single ﬁlament for r = 33 is displayed in the d STORM image instead of two ﬁlaments ( Fig . 2C ) . An increased ratio of r = 100 can already separate the two ﬁla - ments because more regular localizations are approximated . In other words , if the number of regular localizations is signiﬁcantly greater than the number of multiple - ﬂuorophore localizations , the two ﬁlaments become distinguishable . Interestingly , depending on the distance of ﬁlaments with respect to the labeling density , the multiple - ﬂuorophore localization can also generate “artiﬁcial” ﬁl - aments in the d STORM image . As can be seen in Fig . 2C for the ﬁlament distance of 100nm the ﬁlaments become resolvable for lower (cid:3) compared to the ﬁlament distance of 50nm . However , for r = 100 , a third “ﬁlament” appears between the “real” ﬁlaments due to remaining multiple - ﬂuorophore localizations . Thus , under unfavorable conditions an insufﬁcient r can easily lead to a misin - terpretation of number and diameter of cellular structures . Toexperimentallyverifyourtheoreticalconsiderations , weused the photoswitchable ﬂuorophore Alexa Fluor 647 , a carbocyanine derivative that can be cycled between a ﬂuorescent and a non - ﬂuorescentstateuponirradiationwithlaserlight ( Heilemannetal . , 2005 , 2008 ) . The switching rates of Alexa Fluor 647 can be adjusted by the irradiation intensity : the rate k off linearly scales with the read - out wavelength 647nm , and the rate k on linearly scales with the reactivation wavelength at 488 , 514 , or 532nm ( Heilemann et al . , 2008 ) . Thus , the ratio of the switching rates r = k off / k on can easily be adjusted , and the same structure can be imaged multi - ple times with different ratios r without the need of changing the chemical environment . Furthermore , the rates enable to adjust the actual lifetime of the ﬂuorescent and non - ﬂuorescent state with k off = (cid:2) on − 1 and k on = (cid:2) off − 1 , and thus to control the imaging speed . The microtubulin structure in COS7 cells shown in Fig . 3 was imaged with two different ratios r 1 = 153 ± 11 and r 2 = 503 ± 37 . Both ratios generate a d STORM image with signiﬁcant improve - ment in resolution compared to standard TIRF microscopy . However , crossing and adjacent ﬁlaments cannot be resolved clearly applying the lower ratio r 1 , whereas with higher rate - ratio r 2 structural details become visible ( Fig . 3B and C ) . In addition , it has to be mentioned that the commercial available Alexa Fluor 647 labeled antibodies used have a DOL of 3 , which further reduces the rate - ratios to r 1 ≈ 50 and r 2 ≈ 170 as the lifetime of the “off - state of the antibody” becomes three times shorter . Furthermore , one has to consider that an increase in resolu - tion and dimension affects the number of required ﬂuorophores non - linearly ( Ji et al . , 2008 ) . A two - dimensional lattice of ﬂuorophores spaced by 40nm enables a spatial resolution Fig . 3 . Super - resolution ﬂuorescence images of the microtubule network of a COS - 7 cell labeled with Alexa Fluor 647 . ( A ) In contrast to the ﬂuorescence image , the d STORM images clearly demonstrate a superior resolution . The same microtubule network was acquired with two different switching rate - ratios of Alexa Fluor 647 r 1 = 153 ± 11and r 2 = 503 ± 37 . ConsideringaDOLof ∼ 3fortheantibody , theeffective rate - ratios are r 1 ≈ 50 and r 2 ≈ 170 . ( B ) Magniﬁed views of two insets are shown in ( A ) forbothratios . ( C ) Cross - sectionproﬁleofabundleofadjacentmicrotubulesfor two switching ratios demonstrates that a higher r affords substantially improved discrimination in areas with high labeling density . of 80nm , corresponding to 625molecules / (cid:3) m 2 . In a three - dimensional lattice 15 , 625molecules / (cid:3) m 3 would be necessary . To achieve 20nm resolution , considerably higher labeling densities of 10 6 molecules / (cid:3) m 3 and 10 4 molecules / (cid:3) m 2 , respectively , are required . In Fig . 4A , a 2D lattice was simulated with a ﬂuorophore density of 625 (cid:3) m − 2 . Thus , 69 ﬂuorophores are present within a diffraction - limited area ( ∼ 0 . 11 (cid:3) m 2 ) . Consequently , a minimal r of 69 is required to resolve the lattice structure within the area of the point - spread function correctly . However , as can be seen in Fig . 4A for a density of 625ﬂuorophores / (cid:3) m 2 the ratio r = 100 is not sufﬁcient to resolve the whole lattice without artifacts . Espe - cially in the center of the lattice ﬂuorophores are still unresolved . This means that also the surrounding of the PSF has a critical effect , because adjacent ﬂuorophores further complicate the ﬁt - ting procedure . Here , the ratio r for resolving the lattice is located between 100 and 200 . In addition , in Fig . 4B the impact of multiple - ﬂuorophore localizations is highlighted . The rate r = 1000 provides the highest contrast because multiple - ﬂuorophore localization are dramatically reduced . These considerations are important for studies of biomolecular organization in cells , e . g . the formation of clusters , which can be investigated by single - molecule localization methods ( Greenﬁeld et al . , 2009 ; Shroff et al . , 2008 ; van de Linde et al . , 2008b ) . Different to structural motifs that can be labeled at high density , this is not possible for individual proteins as their natural distribution sets an upper limit . Mitochondrial proteins of the respiratory chain for example are densely packed in the inner mitochondrial membrane due to the fact that the membrane is upended . In our experiments we stained the F 0 F 1 - ATPsynthase and cytochrome c oxidase with Alexa Fluor 647 and applied three different rate - ratios for d STORM , r 1 = 153 ± 11 , r 2 = 386 ± 29 , and r 3 = 740 ± 55 ( Fig . 4C ) . Once again one has to consider that the used antibody carries three ﬂuo - rophoreswhichreducestheeffectiverate - ratiosto r 1 ≈ 50 , r 2 ≈ 130 , and r 3 ≈ 250 . Albeit the improvement in spatial resolution of the d STORM image compared to the TIRF microscopy image is obvi - 264 S . van de Linde et al . / Journal of Biotechnology 149 ( 2010 ) 260 – 266 Fig . 4 . d STORMofnon - continuousstructures .

In ( B ) a histogram constructed from the entire lattice is shown . A ratio of r = 100 only resolves the lattice partially ( boundary area ) . A ratio of r = 200 already resolves the whole lattice , and the best contrast is achieved for r = 1000 where multiple - ﬂuorophore localizations are very unlikely . ( C ) F 0 F 1 - ATPase and cytochrome c - Oxidase in the mitochondrial inner membrane of mammalian COS - 7 cells , labeled via immunocytochemistry with Alexa Fluor 647 . The d STORM image reveals structural details on the distribution of the proteins . The different rate - ratios of r 1 = 153 ± 11 , r 2 = 386 ± 29 , and r 3 = 740 ± 55 reveal different structural details . ous , the higher rate - ratio r 3 enables a more accurate mapping of proteins as in the case of r 2 . As can be seen in Fig . 4C , the smallest rate - ratio r 1 is insufﬁcient to resolve structural details . For higher proteindensitiessinglylabeledantibodies ( DOL = 1 ) havetobeused incombinationwithshort (cid:2) on realizedbyappropriateexperimental conditions . To conclude , there is ample scope to customize photo - switching rates and labeling densities to resolve biomolecules at true - molecular resolution in cells , i . e . at a length scale of only a few nanometers especially in densely packed regions . 3 . Conclusion We demonstrated how subdiffraction - resolution microscopy of cellular structures is inﬂuenced by the switching rates of photoswitchable ﬂuorophore and their labeling density . Linear ﬁl - amentous structures , e . g . microtubules , can be resolved easily at “low” switching rates , as long as multiple - ﬂuorophore localiza - tions are made along a ﬁlament . The situation changes when more than one ﬁlament is in the diffraction - limited area corresponding S . van de Linde et al . / Journal of Biotechnology 149 ( 2010 ) 260 – 266 265 to a higher ﬂuorophore density . In order to resolve adjacent or crossing ﬁlaments , the ratio of photoswitching rates must be sub - stantiallyincreased . Furthermore , whenthestructuralorganization of proteins in membranes or subcellular organelles is studied , very high photoswitching ratios have to be applied to ensure a pre - cise localization . Our theoretical and experimental considerations highlight the importance of stable non - ﬂuorescent states as cen - tralpartofsingle - moleculebasedlocalizationmicroscopymethods and demonstrate that the photoswitching rates have to be carefully adjusted to meet the experimental requirements . 4 . Materials and methods 4 . 1 . dSTORM d STORM with Alexa Fluor 647 was performed on an Olympus IX - 71invertedmicroscopeapplyinganobjective - typetotalinternal reﬂectionﬂuorescence ( TIRF ) conﬁgurationusinganoil - immersion objective ( PlanApo 60 × , NA 1 . 45 , Olympus ) ( Heilemann et al . , 2008 ) . Two continuous wave laser beams ( 647nm and a shorter wavelength , 488or514nm ) ofanargon – kryptonlaser ( Innova70C , Coherent ) were selected by an acousto - optic tunable ﬁlter ( AOTF ) and used simultaneously for read - out and activation . Using appro - priate ﬁlter sets the ﬂuorescence was imaged on an EMCCD camera ( Andor Ixon DU888 ) . Photoswitching of Alexa Fluor 647 was per - formed with 0 . 02 – 0 . 5kW / cm 2 at 488 or 514nm and 4 – 26kW / cm 2 at 647nm with frame rates of 50 – 200Hz recording 10 , 000 – 15 , 000 images with total acquisition times of 50 – 200s . The ratio (cid:3) was adjusted by the irradiation intensity at the read - out and activa - tion wavelength according to ( Heilemann et al . , 2008 ) . The images were analyzed and reconstructed as described by ( Wolter et al . , 2010 ) . The pixel size in the d STORM images are 8 . 5nm in Fig . 2 and Fig . 4A ( ﬁlament and lattice simulation ) , 20nm in Fig . 3 and 10nm in Fig . 4C . 4 . 2 . Simulations We simulated the resolution of straight lines by placing ﬂuo - rophores along several pairs of straight lines . The ﬁrst pair was placed along the horizontal axis of the simulated detection pixel arrayandthetwolinesspaced50nmapartfromeachother , thesec - ondpairinclined70 ◦ andspaced100nm , andthethirdpairinclined 140 ◦ and spaced 300nm . Along each line , one ﬂuorophore was placed every 8 . 5nm . We simulated an 85nm pixel detection raster . The relative intensity of each ﬂuorophore in each of the surround - ing pixels was computed by numerically integrating a Besselian point - spread function with a FWHM of 375nm using the GNU Scientiﬁc Library implementation of 87 - point Gauss – Kronrod inte - gration . We modeled ﬂuorophores activity as a time - continuous Markov process with ﬁxed expected active times of 0 . 3s and with expected off times of r * 0 . 3s , both varied randomly according to an exponential distribution and unsynchronized with acquisition times . Simulatedﬂuorophoresemitted1000photonspersimulated acquisition frame of 0 . 1s . To obtain the number of photons emit - ted by a ﬂuorophore in a speciﬁc acquisition frame , we multiplied this number with the time the ﬂuorophore spent in the on time in this frame . The number of photons measured in each pixel from a given ﬂuorophore was then drawn from a binomial distribution with the relative ﬂuorophore intensity giving the probability and the number of events being the total number of emitted photons . Theresultingvaluewasmultipliedbytheexpectednumberofcam - era A / D counts per photon and added to random background noise tocomputetheﬁnalintensityforeachpixelinthesimulatedimage . Theprocesswasrepeatedfor5000switchingcycles . Theprobability distribution for the background noise was determined from a his - togram of the background pixels in a real acquisition . The number ofA / Dcountsperpixelswastakenfromthecamera’smanual , while allotherparametersweredeterminedfromrealexperimentaldata . For simulating the resolution for larger , continuous areas , we placedﬂuorophoresonarectangularlatticewithaspacingof40nm . The images were computed analogously to the line - based ﬂuo - rophore distribution . 4 . 3 . Spot discarding Probable double spot emissions were found by checking the differences between the quadrant sums of the ﬁt residue matrix against a threshold . Probable double emissions were then checked by ﬁtting a two - kernel Gaussian model to the data and discarded when the (cid:4) 2 value was signiﬁcantly smaller than the one - kernel (cid:4) 2 . 4 . 4 . Immunocytochemistry Microtubulin or mitochondrial proteins in COS - 7 cells were stained via indirect immunocytochemistry . African green monkey kidney COS - 7 cells were plated in LabTek eight well chambered coverglass ( Nunc ) . After 12 – 24h , the cells were ﬁxed using 3 . 7 % paraformaldehydeinPBSfor10min . Afterwards , cellswerewashed and permeabilized with PBS containing and 0 . 5 % ( v / v ) Triton X - 100 ( Sigma ) for 10min and blocked with blocking buffer ( PBS contain - ing 5 % ( w / v ) NGS ( Sigma ) ) for 30min . Microtubules were stained with mouse monoclonal anti - (cid:2) - tubulin antibodies ( Sigma , clone AA2 ) serving as secondary antibody , both for 30min . In order to stain cytochrome c oxidase of mitochondria , COS - 7 cells were incubated with mouse mono - clonalanti - OxPhosComplexVsubunit (cid:2) IgGantibodies ( Invitrogen , clone3D5 ) andmousemonoclonalanti - OxPhosComplexIVsubunit I IgG antibodies ( Invitrogen , clone 1D6 ) for 30min . Afterwards cells were stained 30min with Alexa 647 labeled goat anti - mouse anti - bodies ( Invitrogen ) serving as secondary antibody . Three washing steps using PBS containing 0 . 1 % ( v / v ) Tween 20 ( Sigma ) were per - formedaftereachstainingstep . ThelabelingstoichiometryofAlexa 647 labeled goat anti - mouse antibodies was determined to ∼ 3 by absorption spectroscopy . Before d STORM imaging , the PBS buffer was replaced by switching buffer , which is PBS ( pH 7 . 4 ) , containing oxygen scavenger ( 0 . 5mg / mL glucose oxidase ( Sigma ) , 40 (cid:3) g / mL cata - lase ( Roche Applied Science ) , 10 % ; w / v glucose ) and 50mM (cid:2) - mercaptoethylamine ( Sigma ) .
