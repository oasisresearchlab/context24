Pollard , Yale University , New Haven , CT , and approved July 21 , 2011 ( received for review May 16 , 2011 ) The WAVE regulatory complex ( WRC ) is a critical element in the control of actin polymerization at the eukaryotic cell membrane , but how WRC is activated remains uncertain . While Rho GTPase Rac1 can bind and activate WRC in vitro , this interaction is of low affinity , suggesting other factors may be important . By reconstitut - ing WAVE - dependent actin assembly on membrane - coated beads in mammalian cell extracts , we found that Rac1 was not sufficient to engender bead motility , and we uncovered a key requirement for Arf GTPases . In vitro , Rac1 and Arf1 were individually able to bind weakly to recombinant WRC and activate it , but when both GTPases were bound at the membrane , recruitment and concomi - tant activation of WRC were dramatically enhanced . This coopera - tivity between the two GTPases was sufficient to induce WAVE - dependent bead motility in cell extracts . Our findings suggest that Arf GTPases may be central components in WAVE signalling , acting directly , alongside Rac1 . D ynamic assembly of the actin cytoskeleton is central to the architecture and movement of eukaryotic cells . Actin poly - merization is nucleated by the ubiquitous Arp2 / 3 complex , which is activated by nucleation promoting factors ( NPFs ) , most promi - nently N - WASP ( neural Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein ) and the WAVE ( WASP family veroprolin homologue ) regulatory complex ( WRC ) , which comprises WAVE , Cyfip , Nap1 , Abi1 , and HSPC300 or their homologues ( 1 ) . It has been established that purified N - WASP can be activated by the Rho GTPase Cdc42 and the lipid PIP2 ( 2 ) , which trigger a conformational change in N - WASP , exposing its actin - polymerizing VCA domain ( 3 ) . In contrast , the mechanism of WRC activation remains rela - tively unclear . Purified Rho GTPase Rac1 can bind and activate recombinant WRC in vitro ( 4 ) , and the crystal structure of the WRC identified a potential binding site for Rac1 in Cyfip ( 5 ) , prompting a proposal that , analogous to Cdc42 activation of N - WASP , binding of Rac1 leads to activation of the WRC by triggering exposure of the WAVE VCA domain . However , the Rac1 interaction with WRC in vitro is of very low affinity , about 8 μ M ( 5 ) , supporting the likelihood that additional factors may be important in WRC activation ( 6 ) . This may be especially evi - dent at the membrane . We aimed to establish which determinants could be key to this process by reconstituting WAVE - dependent actin polymerization at phospholipid membranes in a complex mammalian brain cell extract . Results Reconstitution of WAVE - Dependent Actin Assembly at the Membrane . It has previously been established that Cdc42 / N - WASP - depen - dent actin assembly can be reconstituted on PIP2 - containing liposomes added to mammalian cell extract ( 7 , 8 ) . We used a similar approach to reconstitute Rac1 / WAVE - dependent actin polymerization using silica beads coated with a lipid bilayer of phosphatidylcholine ( PC ) , phosphatidylinositol ( PI ) , and a low concentration ( 4 % ) of either PIP3 or , as a control , PIP2 ( Fig . 1 and Fig . S1 A ) . When added to mammalian cell extract , both beads recruited actin , and when the extract was activated ( i . e . , by adding GTP γ S to stimulate endogenous small GTPases ) comet tails were formed immediately on both PIP2 and PIP3 beads , which were propelled through the extract for an hour or longer ( Fig . 1 A , i , and B , i , and Movies S1 , S2 , and S3 ) . Actin recruitment and consequent movement by both PIP2 and PIP3 beads was inhibited by preincubation of extract with an inhibitor of Rac1 and Cdc42 ( PBD , the GTPase - binding domain from PAK1 ) ( 9 , 10 ) , or with RhoGDI , which extracts membrane Rho GTPases into an inactive soluble complex ( 11 ) ( Fig 1 A , ii , and B , ii ) , confirming reports that Rac1 and / or Cdc42 are required to initiate actin assembly ( 8 ) . PIP2 - induced actin comet tail formation was also prevented by preincubation of extract with a dominant - negative inhibitor of N - WASP ( the derivative N - WASP Δ VCA ) but not by the Rac1 inhibitor NSC23766 ( 12 ) ( Fig . 1 A , ii ) , while PIP3 - induced actin tail formation was inhibited only when both N - WASP Δ VCA and NSC23766 inhibi - tors were added together ( Fig . 1 B , ii ) . Immunodepletion of WAVE from the extract efficiently inhibited PIP3 motility in the presence of N - WASP Δ VCA ( Fig . S1 B and C ) , confirming that actin assembly on these beads is WAVE - dependent . These assays demonstrate that whereas PIP2 actin - dependent movement is due solely to the Cdc42 / N - WASP pathway , both this pathway and the Rac1 / WAVE pathway contribute to PIP3 motility . WAVE Complex Activators : Implicating Arf . To determine the compo - nents driving actin assembly at the membrane , we scaled up the motility assays to isolate PIP2 and PIP3 beads on which comet tails had reached maximum ( c . 15 min ) and identified the recruited proteins by mass spectrometry . Key single fractions are shown in Fig . 1 A , iii , and B , iii ; the full results are presented in Fig . S3 and summarized in Dataset S1 . We identified 106 pro - teins on PIP3 beads and 87 on PIP2 beads ; 43 were present on both . Significantly , the only known NPFs associated with either PIP2 or PIP3 were N - WASP and WAVE ; neither bead recruited any Arp2 / 3 - independent actin nucleators ( e . g . , formins ) . PIP2 and PIP3 beads both achieved N - WASP - dependent motility , and consistent with this Cdc42 and N - WASP were found on both of them ( Fig . 1 A , iii , and B , iii ) . WRC components PIR121 , Nap1 , Abi1 and WAVE were , like Rac1 , also prominent on both PIP2 and PIP3 beads ( Fig . 1 A , iii and B , iii ) . The GTP γ S - dependent recruitment of these key proteins was reproducible and was confirmed by immunoblotting ( Fig . S4 ) , which also identified the smaller fifth WRC component , HSPC300 , on both . A signif - icant and surprising observation was that although the WRC was present on PIP2 and PIP3 beads , only PIP3 triggered Rac / WAVE - mediated motility ( Fig . 1 A , ii and B , ii ) . The inability of PIP2 to activate the WRC was not due to Rac1 activation status ( Fig . S5 ) . Collectively , these data demonstrated that WRC re - cruitment and Rac1 activity are not sufficient to activate actin Author contributions : V . K . and P . J . H . designed research ; V . K . , P .

As we sought to identify this missing factor , we noticed that the Arf GAP ( inactivator ) GIT1 ( 13 ) ( and its binding partners β - Pix and PAK ) was recruited only by PIP2 . In contrast , arfaptin , which specifically binds to active Arf GTPases ( 14 ) , was only detected on PIP3 . This suggested that a critical difference could be that the Arf GTPases found on PIP3 beads were active , while those on PIP2 beads were not . We therefore activated the Arfs recruited to PIP2 by prebinding the Arf GEFARNO ( 15 ) [ which contains a phosphatidylinositol - binding pleckstrin homology ( PH ) domain ] to the beads before their addition to the extract . Actin comet tails were generated , even when the N - WASP pathway was inhibited ( Fig . 2 A and Movie S4 ) . This strongly implicated Arf GTPase activity as the missing factor key to WAVE - dependent actin assembly . To confirm this , we initially preincubated extract with brefeldin A , a commonly used inhibitor of Arf . This had no effect on actin comet tail assembly , but this is perhaps not surprising because brefeldin A is not a direct inhibitor of Arf , per se , but actually inhibits a subset of Arf Gefs ( 16 ) . Consequently , we utilized GAT , a domain of GGA1 , which specifically binds and inhibits active , GTP - bound Arf GTPases ( 17 , 18 ) . Preincubation of extract with GAT had no effect on the actin - dependent motility of either PIP2 beads ( i . e . , N - WASP - dependent ) or PIP3 beads ( which activate both N - WASP and WAVE ; Fig . 2 B ) . However , in N - WASP Δ VCA - inhibited extract , GAT abolished PIP3 - induced comet tail formation ( Fig . 2 b ) . This demonstrated that active Rac is not enough for WRC activation . Arf is required . Arf Interaction with the WAVE Complex . We next focused on the ability of Rac1 and Arf1 to recruit the WRC from extract to the membrane . To eliminate any contributions from the PIP2 and PIP3 phospholipids themselves , purified in vitro acylated Rac1 or Arf1 ( or control Cdc42 ) were each anchored to beads coated with PC : PI alone and activated by loading with GTP γ S , before adding to the extract . NaCl extraction of these Arf 1 GTP γ S beads revealed distinct protein bands ( Fig . 3 A and Fig . S6 A ) , which mass spectrometry identified as WRC components Cyfip , Nap1 ( which are structurally homologous and together constitute a subcomplex ( 5 ) , and in smaller amounts , WAVE and Abi . Deter - gent solubilization of the lipid bilayer coat to release membrane - associated GTPases and remaining high - affinity proteins again detected Cyfip and Nap1 ( Fig . 3 A ) , indicating their strong inter - action with the Arf 1 GTP γ S beads . In contrast , no WRC compo - nents were detected on Rac 1 GTP γ S beads ( Fig . 3 A and Fig . S6 B and confirmed by Western blotting ; Fig . S4 ) , which recruited Fig . 1 .

S6 C ) . Control Cdc 42 GTP γ S beads recruited detectable levels of Cyfip , Nap1 , and Abi1 but not WAVE ( Fig . 3 A and Fig . S6 D ) . To confirm that Arf1 can directly interact with one or more WRC components , the Cyfip / Nap1 - enriched NaCl extraction from the Arf 1 GTP γ S beads ( Fig . 3 A ) was diluted and incubated with lipid - coated beads anchored with either active ( GTP γ S - bound ) or inactive ( GDP - bound ) forms of each GTPase . Control Cdc42 bound neither Cyfip nor Nap1 , nor did Arf 1 GDP , but Arf 1 GTP γ S bound both ( Fig . 3 B ) . An unbiased search of the pro - tein structure database revealed that the structural homologues Cyfip and Nap1 each contain a subdomain that shows a striking similarity to the Arf - binding GAT domain of GGA1 and GGA3 ( Fig . S7 A and B ) , and consistent with this Arf 1 GTP γ S ( but not Arf 1 GDP ) bound directly to purified , recombinant Cyfip , Nap1 , and Cyfip - Nap1 subcomplex ( Fig . S7 C ) . Rac 1 GTP γ S ( but not Rac GDP ) also bound Cyfip and Nap1 , compatible with active Rac 1 GTP γ S interacting with purified WRC components ( 19 ) . But as we showed ( Fig . 3 A ) , unlike Arf1 , Rac is not sufficient to recruit the WRC in our motility assay . Rac 1 GTP γ S beads showed only weak recruitment of purified recombinant WRC ( rWRC ) , even at micromolar concentrations ( Fig . 3 C ) , consistent with the reported low affinity of Rac1 for the WRC in solution ( 5 ) . Arf 1 GTP γ S beads also recruited rWRC only at high concentrations ( Fig . 3 C ) , which was surprising because these beads recruited the complex from brain extract ( Fig . 3 A ) . Because Rac1 was present on Arf GTP γ S beads isolated from extract ( Fig . S6 ) , it seemed the two GTPases might cooperate to bring the WRC efficiently to the membrane . Indeed , anchoring both Arf 1 GTP γ S and Rac 1 GTP γ S to beads allowed recruitment of rWRC when present at low nanomolar concentrations ( Fig . 3 C ) . Collectively , these results confirm that while Rac and Arf can interact with the WRC individually , both GTPases are required for efficient , stable recruitment to the membrane . To determine whether Arf1 and Rac1 can activate purified rWRC at the membrane , acylated GTP γ S - bound GTPases were each anchored in turn to PC : PI - coated beads prior to incubation with rWRC , Arp2 / 3 and fluorescently labeled actin , and WAVE activity monitored by accumulation of actin at the bead surface . In this assay , control Cdc 42 GTP γ S beads preincubated with puri - fied N - WASP efficiently induced actin polymerization at the surface of 95 (cid:1) 3 . 3 % of beads , while empty PC : PI - coated beads did not activate rWRC ( Fig . 3 D ) . When incubated with 1 μ M rWRC ( conditions that support rWRC membrane recruitment ; Fig . 3 C ) , both Rac 1 GTP γ S beads and Arf 1 GTP γ S beads displayed weak activation , as indicated by a low level of actin localization ( typified in Fig . 3 D ) around 11 (cid:1) 3 . 1 % and 14 (cid:1) 2 . 6 % of beads , respectively . In contrast , 95 (cid:1) 4 . 8 % of beads anchored with both Rac1 and Arf1 were associated with pronounced actin accumula - tion , even when only 10 nM rWRC was present ( Fig . 3 D ) , indi - cating strong activation . WAVE Complex Activation by Cooperating GTPases Arf and Rac1 . We next assessed Arf and Rac cooperativity in activating endogenous WRC in brain extract . Acylated GTP γ S - bound Arf 1 GTP γ S and Rac 1 GTP γ S ( and control Cdc 42 GTP γ S ) were again ( as in Figs 1 and 2 ) anchored individually to PC : PI - coated beads prior to motility assay , but no GTP γ S was added to the extract ( i . e . , en - dogenous GTPases were not activated ) . Cdc 42 GTP γ S beads gener - ated comet tails and moved in response to the N - WASP pathway , whereas beads anchored with Rac 1 GTP γ S did not move ( Fig . 4 A ) , again consistent with the inability of Rac to recruit the WRC to the membrane ( Fig . 3 A ) . Arf 1 GTP γ S beads induced formation of actin comet tails shorter than those induced by PIP3 but only after a 3 – 4 min lag ( Fig . 4 A ) . This initially promoted bead motility , but in contrast to PIP3 - induced movement it was not sustained beyond 15 min . Arf 1 GTP γ S beads , like PIP3 beads , also moved in N - WASP - inhibited extract ( Fig . 4 A and Movie S5 ) . When we activated endogenous GTPases by adding GTP γ S , the Arf 1 GTP γ S beads formed long comet tails , allowing sustained motility ( Fig . 4 B and Movie S6 ) . Arf 1 GTP γ S bead motility was abolished in extract preincubated with the PBD inhibitor ( Fig . 4 B ) , suggesting that Rac1 enhanced the Arf1 - induced move - ment . This was confirmed by coanchoring Rac 1 GTP γ S and Fig . 3 . BindingandactivationofWRCbymembrane - anchoredArf1 , Racand Cdc42 .

This motility was inhib - ited by addition of PBD or GAT , emphasizing that active GTP - bound Rac1 and Arf1 are both required to activate the WRC . WAVE Activation by Other Arf Family GTPases . To determine whether Arf1 ’ s ability to recruit and activate the WRC is common to other Arf family GTPases we repeated the recruitment and motility experiments described in Figs . 3 A and 4 with the closely related Arf5 or the more distant Arl1 . Each Arf GTPase recruited the WRC to the membrane ( Fig . S8 ) and triggered WAVE - depen - dent bead motility ( i . e . , in N - WASP Δ VCA - inhibited extract ) , either alone or when coanchored with Rac 1 GTP γ S ( Fig . 4 C ) . Motility of Arf5 and Arl1 beads was prevented by PBD , but only Arf5 - dependent motility was abolished by GAT , which binds active Arfs but not Arls ( Fig . 4 C ) . Arl1 , like Arf5 and Arf1 , there - fore acts directly and not via activation of other Arfs . Discussion How the WRC is activated to promote actin assembly is an im - portant question in cell biology . A previous study ( 4 ) has reported in vitro activation of immunopurified WRC by weakly bound Rac1 ( when present with acidic phospholipids ) . Here , by using a reconstitution system comprising lipid - coated beads added to a complex cell extract , we established that Rac1 is necessary but not sufficient to induce WAVE - dependent actin motility ; another unknown factor was required . Extensive attempts at reconstitu - tion assays and systematic mass spectrometry analysis of the pro - tein platforms recruited to the lipid - coated beads implicated Arf as the missing factor . By using specific inhibitors of Rac1 , Cdc42 , and Arf GTPases , we showed that Arf activity is required for WAVE - mediated bead motility . In a second step , we uncovered the role of Arf by anchoring recombinant acylated Arf and Rac1 to lipid - coated beads , which enabled us to directly demonstrate synergy between Rac1 and Arf in recruitment and activation of the WRC . Acylated Rac1 alone promoted a low level of activa - tion of recombinant WRC at the surface of lipid - coated beads . However , when Arf was also present on the membrane , WAVE activation was dramatically enhanced and could be achieved with much lower concentrations of WRC . We went on to show that Arf directly binds both Cyfip and Nap1 , structurally homologous components of the WRC . We could not achieve saturatable bind - ing to Rac1 or Arf beads even when WRC was present at 1 μ M , suggesting that the apparent K D for both Arf and Rac1 is > 1 μ M . However , when both GTPases were present , the apparent K D is much stronger , as efficient binding was seen even at low nM concentrations of WRC . This could be because the low affinity binding of one GTPase triggers a conformational change in the WRC that increases the affinity for the second GTPase , or it may simply be the result of increased avidity . The role of Arf binding does not seem to be limited to increasing the affinity of WRC binding as , like Rac1 , Arf alone could also induce WRC activity . Our findings open the possibility that both these small GTPases , Arf and Rac1 , play a direct cooperative role in triggering the conformational changes in the WRC that lead to VCA domain exposure and consequent actin assembly . Although Arf GTPases are best known for their role in vesi - cular transport , they are increasingly recognized as key regulators of the actin cytoskeleton at the plasma membrane ( 20 ) . Expres - sion of dominant - negative Arf derivatives , or the depletion of Arfs by RNAi , has been shown to inhibit Rac - dependent breast cancer cell migration ( 21 ) , membrane ruffling ( 22 ) , neurite out - growth ( 23 ) , and phagocytosis ( 24 ) , whereas expression of the Arf GEFARNO induces the formation of lamellipodia and increases motility in epithelial cells ( 25 ) . Evidence suggests that Arfs , espe - cially Arf6 , can act upstream of Rac1 , promoting its activation and / or traffic to the membrane ( 25 ) . However , forced targeting of a constitutively active Rac1 mutant to the plasma membrane could not relieve the inhibition of membrane ruffling caused by expression of a dominant - negative Arf6 construct ( 26 ) . Our find - ings in the cell extract reveal a more direct function for Arfs in Rac1 - mediated actin rearrangements , showing that Arf can act directly alongside Rac1 to play a central role in recruitment and activation of the WRC . Our experiments demonstrated that recruitment and activa - tion of the WRC at the membrane is not unique to Arf1 but can be similarly directed by Arf5 and Arl1 , close and distant members of the Arf GTPase family , respectively . Indeed Arf family GTPases appear to have at least partially redundant or overlap - ping functions , because RNAi - mediated knockdown of indiviual Arfs had little impact on Golgi morphology , whereas knockdown of multiple Arfs had profound effects ( 27 ) . We showed that Arf activity alone was not sufficient to activate WAVE in the cell ex - tracts ; Rac1 was also required , suggesting that Arf activation might only trigger WRC - dependent actin assembly if it is spatially and temporally coincident with Rac1 activation . Rac1 is best known for promoting WRC activity at the plasma membrane . Although Arf6 is the most prominent Arf family member found at the plasma membrane , Arfs 1 – 5 cycle through the cytosol when inactive and are thus available to bind to other membrane com - partments and could therefore be available to activate WRC . Likewise Rac1 , although predominantly found at the plasma membrane , has also been demonstrated to form complexes at other known sites of Arf action — e . g . , the Golgi ( 28 ) . The specificity of Arf signaling seems to be determined by the large family of Arf GEFs , which activate Arfs at specific cellular locations to produce precise responses ( 16 ) , so it is likely that GEFs will play a significant role in determining which Arfs pro - mote WRC activation , and where this occurs , in vivo .

For example , the Arf GEFARNO forms a complex with the Rac GEF DOCK180 to promote lamellipodia formation and cell migration ( 29 ) . Significantly , a mutant ARNO derivative that is unable to activate Arf but can still recruit DOCK180 ( and therefore trigger Rac1 activity ) fails to induce actin rearrange - ments ( 30 ) , suggesting a direct role for Arf . A negative regulator of Arf signalling , the Arf GAP GIT1 , also forms a complex with a Rac1 GEF , β - PIX , and during α 4 integrin - mediated migra - tion has been proposed to localize to the sides and rear of motile cells where it functions to inhibit Rac1 - mediated actin assembly , thereby limiting protrusion to the cell ’ s leading edge ( 31 ) . The Slit2 - Robo4 complex promotes vascular stablity by recruiting GIT1 to inhibit Rac1 - dependent protrusive activity ( 32 ) . Our results also appear to strengthen the possibility that WRC could function in the many cellular pathways known to be con - trolled by Arf GTPases . Arfs 1 – 5 localize predominantly to the Golgi where they are required for correct Golgi morpholgy ( 27 ) . The WRC has also been shown to be required for maintai - nence of Golgi structure in Drosophila cells ( 33 ) . Arf1 also acts to recruit the adaptor protein AP - 1 to the trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) to mediate traffic between the TGN , endosomes , and the plasma membrane , and the WRC has been found colocalized with these AP - 1 complexes ( 34 ) . Additional work will be required to decipher the potential role of WRC away from the plasma membrane . The in vivo importance and mechanistic details of our findings will , as is the case with Rac1 , require further studies . Due to the redundancy of Arf family members and potential pleiotropic effects of their knockdown , it is likely that focusing on the reg - ulators of Arf signalling ( GEFs and GAPs ) will be required to illuminate this pathway clearly . Deciphering the dual and see - mingly cooperative actions of the two key GTPases will have a significant impact on our understanding of the regulation of cytoskeletal structure and function . Methods Assay of Actin - Based Motility by Phospholipid - Coated Beads . A 60 μ l motility - mix ( extract ) was prepared on ice in the following order : 40 μ l brain extract , 3 μ l 20x energy mix ( 300 mM creatine phosphate , 40 mM MgCl 2 , 40 mM ATP ) , 3 μ lG - actin / rhodamineactin ( 140 μ M , prepared asdescribed ) ( 35 ) , 6 μ l10x salt buffer ( 600 mM KCL , 200 mM 3 - phosphoglycerate ) , 6 μ l 50 mM BAPTA ( Merck ) and 1 μ l 300 mM DTT ( Merck ) and , when appropriate , 1 μ l 30 mM GTP γ S ( Roche ) . Actin - dependent motility assays were initiated by adding 0 . 1 vol phospholipids - coated beads to 10 μ l motility mix , then1 μ l was applied to a microscope slide and sealed under a glass coverslip with Vaseline : lanolin : paraffin ( 1 ∶ 1 ∶ 1 ) , before viewing immediately under a fluorescence micro - scope ( Leica DM IRBE ) at RT . Digital images were captured ( CCD camera , Hamamatsu ) and analyzed ( Volocity , Improvision ) then figures assembled using Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator CS3 . Movies of actin - based motility were captured at three frames per min and shown at 12 frames per second . Comparable comet tails were observed with 0 . 1 μ m to 3 . 0 μ m beads ( e . g . , Movie S8 ) . When indicated , extract was preincubated with inhibitors before addition of beads . No inhibition was observed with any of the inhibitors once poly - merization was initiated . Recombinant GDI and PAK - PBD were used at 0 . 5 mM final concentration , the Rac inhibitor NSC23766 ( Merck ) at 1 mM . N - WASP Δ VCA was used at 5 μ M , 10 - fold higher than required to abolish PIP2beadmotility . LaterassaysofWAVE - dependentmotilitywereperformed in extract preincubated with 10 mM N - WASP Δ VCA ( “ N - WASP - inhibited extract ” ) . For complete inhibition , GAT was used at 30 μ M ( K d ∼ 7 μ M ) for PIP2 / PIP3 motility , and at 70 μ M for assays with recombinant Arfs . For protein isolation , actin - motility assays were scaled up to 30 mL then incubated ( 20 mins , RT ) before phospholipid - coated beads were isolated by low - speed centrifugation ( 1 ; 000 × g ) and washed 10 times in HKS buffer supplemented with 1 mM MgCl 2 ( HKSM ) . Bead - associated proteins were extracted by rotation ( 5 mins ) in HKSM supplemented with 1 M NaCl prior to extraction of remaining bound proteins with HKSM supplemented with 1 % T × 100 detergent . Ionic strength in the extraction was lowered to 50 mM by dilution , then the detergent - extracted proteins were loaded consecutively onto 1ml Heparin and Q - sepharose ion - exchange chromato - graphy columns ( GE Healthcare ) , washed with 10 - column volumes of HKSM buffer , then each column eluted over a 10 - column volume linear 0 – 1 M NaCl gradient . Assay of WAVE Complex Activation on Lipid - Coated Beads . WAVE complex activation on lipid - coated beads was assayed essentially as previously ( 36 ) . Briefly , acylated GTPases were anchored to PC : PI - coated beads and incubated with purified recombinant WAVE complex in HKSM buffer for 10 mins on ice . Beads were then washed and resuspended in HKSM buffer prior to sequential addition of 1 mM ATP , 2 mg ∕ mL BSA , 50 nM Arp2 / 3 complex and 2 μ M G - actin / rhodamine - actin . Actin polymerization was visualized by fluorescence . ACKNOWLEDGMENTS .
