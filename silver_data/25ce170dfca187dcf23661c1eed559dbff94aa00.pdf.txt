Introduction Physical forces contribute to a wide range of biological pro - cesses , including survival ( Chen et al . , 1997 ) , development ( Maniotis et al . , 1997 ; Colombo et al . , 2003 ) , wound healing ( Timmenga et al . , 1991 ) , and growth ( Damien et al . , 2000 ) . The molecular mechanisms by which cells sense and respond to me - chanical signals are not fully understood . It is generally believed that force initiates signal transduction via stretch - activated ion channels in the cell membrane ( Gillespie and Walker , 2001 ) . However , cell mechanotransduction may involve numerous molecular mechanisms other than ion channels , such as force - initiated signal transduction via changes in cytoskeletal – matrix linkages ( Sawada and Sheetz , 2002 ; Tamada et al . , 2004 ) . The assembly / disassembly of stress fibers is greatly affected by Rho - stimulated cytoskeletal contraction ( Bershadsky et al . , 2006 ; Pellegrin and Mellor , 2007 ) and extracellular mechanical force ( applied to the fibers ; Iba and Sumpio , 1991 ; Hayakawa et al . , 2001 ; Kiyoshima et al . , 2011 ) . Actin - depolymerizing factor / cofilin proteins , actin filament - severing proteins , are ubiqui - tously distributed in eukaryotes ( Bamburg et al . , 1999 ) and are preferable candidates for the stress fiber disassembly induced by the loss of fiber tension ( Ono et al . , 1996 ) . Theretofore , it was suggested that an unknown molecule senses the tension in stress fibers and inactivates cofilin by phosphorylation ( Yang et al . , 1998 ) or by phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( Yonezawa et al . , 1990 ) . We propose a novel hypothesis that tension changes are directly sensed by the actin filament by modulating its suscepti - bility to cofilin - mediated severing . To test this hypothesis , single actin filaments were tensed with optical tweezers , and the tension - dependent filament severing by cofilin was examined . Our results demonstrate that tension in the actin filament prevents its severing by cofilin and suggest that the actin filament itself is a tension sen - sor . This is the first demonstration that tension applied to a protein ( e . g . , actin filament ) regulates its susceptibility to a modulating protein ( e . g . , cofilin ) . Results and discussion Single actin filaments function as a mechanosensor An in vitro reconstituted system comprised of only actin fila - ments and recombinant ( dephosphorylated ) cofilin was used to directly test the aforementioned hypothesis . We prepared I ntracellular and extracellular mechanical forces affect the structure and dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton . However , the underlying molecular and biophysical mechanisms , including how mechanical forces are sensed , are largely unknown . Actin - depolymerizing factor / cofilin proteins are actin - modulating proteins that are ubiqui - tously distributed in eukaryotes , and they are the most likely candidate as proteins to drive stress fiber dis - assembly in response to changes in tension in the fiber . In this study , we propose a novel hypothesis that tension in an actin filament prevents the filament from being severed by cofilin . To test this , we placed single actin filaments under tension using optical tweezers . When a fiber was tensed , it was severed after the application of cofilin with a significantly larger delay in comparison with control filaments suspended in solution . The binding rate of cofilin to an actin bundle decreased when the bundle was tensed . These results suggest that tension in an actin filament reduces the cofilin binding , resulting in a decrease in its effective severing activity .

T H E J O U R N A L O F C E L L B I O L O G Y JCB • VOLUME 195 • NUMBER 5 • 2011 722 and direct kinetic measurements ( Andrianantoandro and Pollard , 2006 ) , showing that severing activity of cofilin is slower than cofilin binding . In contrast , when tension (  30 pN ) was generated in a filament , it was not severed or was severed by cofilin with a significantly larger ( P < 0 . 01 ) delay ( 43 . 2 ± 5 . 1 s ; n = 15 ; Fig . 1 E and Video 1 ) . After the cessation of optical trapping , the fila - ment was severed by cofilin within 15 . 1 ± 3 . 7 s ( n = 10 ) . These results demonstrate directly that tension in the actin filament pre - vents , or delays , the filament severing by cofilin ( Fig . 1 , F and G ) . Magnetic micromanipulation of micrometer - sized magnetic particles provides a means to probe force - dependent molecular interactions ( Fig . 1 H ; Wang et al . , 1993 ) . Tension - dependent severing of actin filaments by cofilin was examined by using magnetic beads (  1 µm in diameter ) conjugated with phalloidin and that were attached to the actin filaments tethered on the glass surface by NEM - myosin . Individual beads were pulled tetramethylrhodamine ( TMR ) - labeled single actin filaments ( 8 – 30 µm in length ) with one end tethered to an N - ethylmaleimide ( NEM ) – myosin - coated bead ( 10 µm in diameter ) , whereas the other was trapped with a small ( 3 µm in diameter ) NEM - myosin – coated bead that can be manipulated with optical tweezers . Tension was generated in the filament by displacing the trapping point ( Fig . 1 A and Video 1 ) . We measured the delay from the onset of the cofilin application to the severing of a single filament , with or without externally generated tension in the filament . In control experiments , cofilin was applied to a filament of which one end was suspended in solution . The actin filament was severed 17 . 0 ± 3 . 9 s ( mean ± SEM ; n = 27 ) after a cofilin ( 500 nM ) application ( Fig . 1 [ B and C ] and Video 2 ) . This value agrees with that estimated by measuring the number of actin filament severed in vitro ( Michelot et al . , 2007 ) and actin filament turnover in vivo ( Okreglak and Drubin , 2007 ) Figure 1 . Tension in actin filament prevents or delays severing by cofilin . ( A ) A schematic drawing of the experimental setup . One end of a rhodamine - labeled actin filament was tethered to a NEM - myosin – coated bead ( 10 µm in diameter ; left ) fixed on a coverslip , and the other end of the filament was tethered to a small NEM - myosin – coated bead ( 3 µm in diameter ; right ) trapped by optical tweezers . ( B ) A fluorescence image of an actin filament attached to a bead before application of cofilin . The filament was suspended in the flow by perfusion ( from left to right ) . ( C – E ) The filament was severed at 16 s ( shown by an arrow ) from the onset of cofilin application ( see also Video 2 ) . In contrast , when the actin filament ( D ) was stretched ( E ) by moving the microscope stage ( a bead at the bottom middle of the panel was on the trapping point ) , severing of the filament by cofilin was prevented ( E ; see alsoVideo 1 ) .

( G ) The duration of time observing actin filaments without being severed by cofilin ( solid bars ) was significantly prolonged ( P < 0 . 01 ; n = 15 from 15 independent experiments ) when the filament was tensed with optical tweezers (  30 pN ) . Actin filaments were not severed ( for > 50 s ) when control F - buffer solution was perfused ( hatched bars in F for nontensed filaments and in G for tensed filaments ) .

( I ) The plot shows the number of magnetic beads in a 1 - mm 2 area pulled toward the electromagnet during 2 min of observation after 250 nM cofilin application . The data ( mean ± SEM ; n = 7 ) were plotted with red squares against the force ( from 3 . 4 to 0 . 17 pN ) . A similar plot in gelsolin ( 25 nM ; mean ± SEM ; n = 12 ) is shown with black circles . Vertical bars denote SEM . * , P < 0 . 05 ; * * , P < 0 . 01 , using the Mann - Whitney test . 723 Actin filaments function as a tension sensor • Hayakawa et al . cofilin - binding rate to actin filament meshwork was low ( 0 . 025 ± 0 . 006 events / s in 1 µm 2 of meshwork ; n = 3 ) , and the mean dura - tion of fluorescence was short ( 41 ± 26 ms ; n = 147 ) . However , the rate of binding and fluorescence duration increased ( to 0 . 21 ± 0 . 12 events / s µm 2 [ n = 3 ] and 91 ± 102 ms [ n = 415 ] , respectively ) when the meshwork of actin filaments was severed by scratching the mesh with a pipette tip ( Fig . 2 A ) . Analysis was performed in a narrow ( 2 - µm width ) area facing the scratched region , and ex - amples of the data analyzed are shown in Fig . 2 ( B – E ) and Video 3 . Although most of the binding was brief , slow binding ( 1 – 3 s ) was sometimes detected ( a few percentages of binding events ) . The area free of F - actin gradually expanded during 60 s of ob - servation , suggesting that cofilin had severed the actin filaments . The tethering of actin filaments at multiple sites on the glass surface decreases actin filament flexibility ( Pavlov et al . , 2007 ) , whereas severing results in a freeing of the ends of the actin filaments , allowing their relaxation and tension reduction com - pared with the tethered filaments . These findings suggest that co - filin tends to bind to flexible , not tensed , actin filaments and severs them , as hypothesized ( Michelot et al . , 2007 ; Pavlov et al . , 2007 ) . The dissociation time constant of cofilin from actin filaments was reported to be 0 . 18 s  1 ( Cao et al . , 2006 ) . The long duration ( 1 – 3 s ) of cofilin binding to the actin filaments detected in this study roughly agrees with the aforementioned estimation ( i . e . , the dissociation time constant 0 . 18 s  1 corresponds to a 5 . 6 - s duration of binding ) . Sliding a fine pipette along the surface , actin meshwork often formed a bundle of actin filaments from the actin meshwork , which consisted of F - actin and NEM - myosin ; NEM - myosin binds to actin filaments and facilitates bundle formation by the zippering together of the actin filaments . The cofilin - binding rate to the bundle was 6 . 5 ± 4 . 5 events / s per 1 µm of bundles ( n = 7 ; Fig . 2 [ F and G ] and Video 4 ) . The rate decreased to 2 . 9 ± 2 . 7 events / s when the bundle was stretched 20 – 30 % by toward an electromagnet in a distance - dependent manner ; the force was  3 . 4 pN near the tip of the electromagnet and quickly decreased with distance . Beads did not move to the tip of the magnet in control F buffer solution ; however , in the presence of 250 nM cofilin , the beads in the area exposed to 0 . 2 – 0 . 7 pN of force were moved toward the tip of the magnet , suggesting that the actin filaments tethering the bead to the glass surface were severed by cofilin . In contrast , the beads exposed to a larger force ( > 3 . 4 pN ) were rarely moved toward the tip during 2 min of observation ( Fig . 1 I ) , showing the force - dependent inhibi - tion of actin filaments severing by cofilin . The half - maximum inhibition was seen with  2 pN of force . For comparison , the effect of 25 nM gelsolin applied under the same conditions was examined , which also severs the actin filaments . Beads in the area exposed to the force > 0 . 2 pN were moved toward the tip of the magnet ( Fig . 1 I ) , and the rate of severing was higher where beads were exposed to larger forces . Cofilin binds preferentially to relaxed , not tensed , actin filaments The inhibitory effect of tension on the severing of actin filaments by cofilin may be accounted for by two possible mechanisms : tension in the actin filament affects the binding of cofilin to the filament , and / or the tension affects the severing activity of cofilin already bound to the filament . The effect of tension on the cofilin binding was examined using actin filaments under dif - ferent mechanical conditions . Actin filaments were tethered at multiple sites on the coverslip by NEM - myosin , and 50 nM 5 - iodoacetoamide fluorescein ( IAF ) – labeled cofilin was applied ; brief fluorescence emission from IAF - cofilin was observed under total internal reflection fluorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy . The fluorescence was not seen in the absence of actin filaments , indicating that it takes place only during transient binding of cofilin to the actin filaments . Quantitative analysis showed that the Figure 2 . Binding of cofilin to actin filaments . ( A ) A schematic drawing of the experimental setup .

JCB • VOLUME 195 • NUMBER 5 • 2011 724 To examine the tension - dependent cofilin binding to the actin stress fibers in living cells , a GFP - cofilin expression construct was introduced into HUVEC cells . In control cells , GFP - cofilin was distributed uniformly in the cytosol and in the lamellipodia ( Fig . 4 A ) , as reported previously ( Obinata et al . , 1997 ) . When the prestretched elastic substratum was relaxed ( 20 % ) , GFP - cofilin was translocated to actin stress fibers within 1 min ( Figs . 4 B and S2 ) , suggesting that the binding of cofilin to stress fibers also depends on tension in the fiber in living cells . These stress fibers were disas - sembled within 30 min when the tension in the stress fibers was de - creased ; similar observations were described earlier ( Ono et al . , 1996 ; Katoh et al . , 2001 ) . These results account for the compressive stress - induced severing of actin bundles ( Medeiros et al . , 2006 ) and disassembly of stress fibers ( Ono et al . , 1996 ) in intact cells . How does tension prevent cofilin binding to actin filaments ? Detailed examination by EM ( McGough et al . , 1997 ; Galkin et al . , 2001 ) revealed a unique property of cofilin ; it induces an  25 % reduction in the pitch of the actin helix while keeping the original length of the filament ( i . e . , the binding of cofilin increases the degree of filament twisting ) . Such a conformational change in the filament is postulated to induce cooperative binding of cofilin to the filament ( McGough et al . , 1997 ; Galkin et al . , 2001 ) . Fluctuation analysis of actin filaments ( Egelman and DeRosier , 1992 ) showed that the amplitude of spontaneous fluctuations moving the tip of the glass pipette attached to one end of the bundle ( Fig . 2 [ H and I ] and Video 5 ) . All these results sug - gest that tension in the actin filaments affects the binding rate of cofilin to actin filaments . Tension - dependent cofilin binding to stress fibers Tension - dependent cofilin binding to actin stress fibers was also examined in semi - intact human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) . Semi - intact cells on a prestretched ( 20 % ) elastic substrate were relaxed in ATP - free buffer ( pH 6 . 5 ) with 500 nM purified cofilin , chemically fixed within 1 min , and stained with an anticofilin antibody . The experiment showed that cofilin distributed along the actin stress fibers in parallel to the axis of relaxation ( Fig . 3 , D – F ) . However , this character - istic staining pattern was not observed when the cells were 10 % stretched ( Fig . 3 , A – C ) , demonstrating that tension prevents the cofilin binding to the tensed stress fibers in semi - intact cells . Quantitative fluorescence image analyses confirmed the tension - dependent cofilin distribution along the actin stress fibers ( Fig . 3 , G – K ) . Furthermore , in ATP - free DK buffer ( Mackay et al . , 1997 ) , which reduces tension in stress fibers by attenuating actomyosin activity , the stress fibers in semi - intact cells were disassembled by 250 nM cofilin in relaxed cells ( Fig . 3 M ) but not in stretched cells ( Fig . 3 L ) . Figure 3 . Cofilin binding to stress fibers is modulated by stretching of semi - intact cells . ( A – F ) Cofilin did not bind to stress fibers in semi - intact cells that were 10 % stretched ( A , B , and C ) but did bind to stress fibers in the cells when they were 20 % relaxed ( D , E , and F ) . The specimen was fixed and then stained for actin ( A and D ) and cofilin ( B and E ) . These images are merged in C ( A and B ) and F ( D and E ) . The double - headed arrow below C shows the direction of stretching , and arrows below F show the direction of relaxation . The high magnification images of the areas enclosed by yellow squares in A – D are shown in G – J , respectively . ( G – J ) Colocalization of actin ( colored red in G and I ) and cofilin ( colored green in H and J ) was evaluated by MetaMorph software ( measure colocalization ) . ( K ) The percentages of cofilin - positive pixels on actin stress fibers ( top ) and percentages of actin - positive pixels on cofilin - positive pixels ( bottom ) are shown . Data were obtained from five cells from two indepen - dent experiments . Vertical bars denote SEM . ( L and M ) Stress fibers in semi - intact cells bathed in ATP - free buffer with 250 nM cofilin were not disassembled when cells were kept stretched 10 % ( L ) but were dis - assembled in the same solution when they were re - laxed 20 % ( M ) . 725 Actin filaments function as a tension sensor • Hayakawa et al . elasticity of actin filaments , suggesting that any changes in elastic - ity will affect cofilin binding and severing . Therefore , reduction in the torsional fluctuation could be a potential molecular mechanism by which actin filament tension prevents cofilin binding . This study demonstrates that a low level of tension ( > 2 pN ) prevents ( or delays ) the severing of actin filaments by cofilin . This effect accounts for the frequent observations in cells that actin filaments with less tension , i . e . , filaments not in use , are severed easily , whereas those in use , and thus generating larger tension , are not severed . The regulation of cofilin binding to the actin filament by tension may be behind these observations , at least in part , as schematically illustrated in Fig . 4 in addition to biochemical regulation of cofilin activity ( Yang et al . , 1998 ; Bamburg , 1999 ) . This study raises the intriguing possibility that actin cytoskeletons are endowed with an ability to sense and respond to mechanical stress , as in the case of focal contact – associated proteins , e . g . , p130Cas ( Sawada et al . , 2006 ) . Materials and methods Direct observation and manipulation of single actin filaments Rhodamine - labeled cytoplasmic  - actin ( Cytoskeleton ) was polymerized in F - buffer at a 1 - mg / ml concentration for 12 h at 4°C . The F - actin solution was diluted at a final concentration of 1 µg / ml in F - buffer with beads (  3 µm in diameter ) coated with NEM - treated rabbit skeletal muscle myosin and placed on an observation chamber ( 0 . 5 × 2 × 18 mm ) . Phalloidin was not added to the solution because it inhibits the binding of cofilin to F - actin . During the experiment , an actin filament with one end attached to a  10 - µm bead was selected , whereas the other end of the filament was trapped with a  3 - µm bead that was manipulated by optical tweezers . The actin filaments were tensed by the optical tweezers . 500 nM mouse recombinant muscle cofilin ( a gift from T . Obinata , Teikyo University , Tokyo , Japan ) was applied by perfusion , allowing the measurement of the delay between the cofilin would twist actin filaments to a degree comparable with the twist when filaments are decorated with cofilin ( McGough et al . , 1997 ) . These results suggest that spontaneous structural fluctuations of actin filaments enable cofilin binding to the filaments and are consistent with the slow - association kinetics ( Cao et al . , 2006 ) . Conceivably , cofilin prefers to associate with the twisted actin filament , which would induce twisting of the neighboring region of the filament , resulting in a cooperative form of cofilin binding . Actin filaments behave like a twin strand of beads that can be easily twisted ( Huxley and Brown , 1967 ) . Precise x - ray diffrac - tion studies indicate that stretching the actin filament is associated with changes in its helical structure ( Huxley and Brown , 1967 ; Wakabayashi et al . , 1994 ) . Based on geometrical considerations of the helical structure of the actin filament , it can be postulated that stretching the filament causes untwisting of its right - handed ge - netic helix . Thus , when the filament is stretched , the amplitude of torsional fluctuations of the filament will be reduced , resulting in an inhibition of the cofilin binding to actin filaments . A tension - dependent reduction in the torsional fluctuations in the single actin filament was demonstrated very recently by molecular dynamics simulations ( Matsushita et al . , 2011 ) . Besides , an evaluation of the effect of long axis tension on phalloidin fluorescence ( Shimozawa and Ishiwata , 2009 ) suggests that external forces distort the fila - ment structure . In this study , a direct measurement of the torsional fluctuations of a single actin filament under different stresses was performed by using a method of Tsuda et al . ( 1996 ) . Experiments demonstrated that the SD of the fluctuations was reduced by 55 – 72 % ( P < 0 . 05 ) by an applied force of  5 pN ( n = 5 ; Fig . S3 ) . Cofilin binding increases the bending ( McCullough et al . , 2008 ; Pfaendtner et al . , 2010 ) and twisting ( Prochniewicz et al . , 2005 ) Figure 4 . Cofilin binding to actin stress fibers in intact cells . ( A ) GFP - cofilin was distributed uniformly in the perinuclear cytosol but was often condensed in the ruffling membrane ; GFP - cofilin did not associate with the stress fibers in control cells . ( B ) When the substratum was relaxed 20 % , GFP - cofilin was translocated to actin stress fibers ( shown by the arrows : see also Fig . S2 ) within 1 min . ( C ) Intensity profiles of the GFP - cofilin along the two lines are shown ( the top profile for control cell and the bottom profile for relaxed cell ) . The broad peak ( a ) in the top profile corresponds to the cofilin condensed in the ruffling membrane ( corresponding with letters in A ) . The narrow peaks ( a , b , and c ) in the bottom profile correspond to the stress fibers ( corresponding with letters in B ) . ( D ) Percent - age of cells positive for GFP - cofilin translocated to actin stress fibers increases from 0 / 17 to 8 / 17 , with relaxing of the sub - strate ( the number of cells examined was 17 from seven in - dependent experiments ) .

JCB • VOLUME 195 • NUMBER 5 • 2011 726 Magnetic force application to beads attached to the actin filaments Avidin - labeled magnetic beads ( SeraMag ; Thermo Fisher Scientific ) were conjugated with biotin - phalloidin ( Invitrogen ) and were then attached to the meshwork of actin filaments that adhered on the glass surface . Magnetic beads were pulled by an electrical magnet as previously mentioned ( Wang et al . , 1993 ; Ueki et al . , 2010 ) . A Permalloy bar (  0 . 5 mm ; Nireco Cor - poration ) was used as the core of the electrical magnet . The procedure of electrochemical polishing of the Permalloy bar , mentioned elsewhere ( Matthews et al . , 2004 ) , sharpens the tip of the bar and enables applying strong magnetic force to the beads . An electrical magnet was made of  5 , 000 turns / cm of copper wire (  0 . 1 mm ) around the Permalloy bar . Preparation of proteins Rabbit skeletal muscle actin was prepared using the method of Spudich and Watt ( 1971 ) . Myosin was prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle , according to Perry ( 1955 ) , and treated with NEM as follows : 5 mg / ml myosin in 0 . 6 M KCl and 20 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 0 , was incubated with 100 µM NEM for 1 h at 4°C . The reaction was stopped by adding dithio - threitol at a final concentration of 10 mM . The solution was diluted 20 times with cold water and centrifuged at 6 , 000 g . The pellet was dissolved in 0 . 6 M KCl and 20 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 0 , and dialyzed against 0 . 6 M KCl and 20 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 0 . An equal volume of glycerol was added and stored at  30°C just before use . Measurement of rotational angular fluctuation of a bead attached to an actin filament while mechanically stretching the filament A streptavidin - conjugated polystyrene bead ( 2 µm in diameter ) was at - tached to a biotin - labeled actin ( Cytoskeleton ) containing actin filament (  1 µm ) that was tethered to a gelsolin molecule on the glass surface . The rotational angular fluctuation of the bead was observed by an inverted microscope ( TE2000 - E ; Nikon ) . Biotin - conjugated small fluorescent beads (  50 nm ) were attached on the streptavidin - conjugated polystyrene bead to detect the changes in the rotational angle . The motion of the fluorescent bead was analyzed by a particle - tracking application of MetaMorph image - analyzing software . A schematic drawing of the experimental setup is shown in Fig . S3 . The streptavidin - conjugated polystyrene bead was op - tically trapped , and the actin filament was stretched by moving the trap - ping point in the downward direction (  5 pN ) .

Severing of actin filaments by mouse cofilin at the con - centration 500 , 250 , 100 , or 50 nM was examined .

No severing was seen in the control perfusate ( F - buffer with 10 mM of dithiothreitol , pH 8 . 0 ) without cofilin in both tensed or not tensed actin filaments up to 120 s in our experi - mental condition . The speed of solution flow was  100 µm / s , which was not different between control and cofilin - containing solutions . Therefore , the filament fluctuations were not changed obviously during perfusion . All imaging experiments were performed at room temperature ( 25°C – 27°C ) . Recombinant mouse muscle cofilin was provided by T . Obinata ( Teikyo University , Tokyo , Japan ) . It should be noticed that vertebrate ( mouse and chick ) cofilin and vertebrate ( rabbit and human ) actin were used in this study , which may provide useful information of interactions between these molecules in cells ( De La Cruz , 2005 ) . The optical trapping system was based on a previous study ( Ashkin et al . , 1987 ) . The maximum retention force of the 1 , 064 - nm laser ( 32 mW ) was calibrated using the viscous dragging method ( Tatsumi and Katayama , 1999 ) . The mean retention force was estimated at  30 pN when a bead (  3 . 0 µm ; PolyScience ) was trapped . All data in this study are presented as mean ± SEM . Imaging cofilin bound to actin filaments The F - actin solution ( one nonlabeled / one rhodamine - labeled actin ) at 10 – 100 µg / ml in F - buffer was put on a glass coverslip coated with 50 µg / ml NEM - treated muscle myosin , blocked by 1 % casein in F - buffer , and washed with F - buffer ( pH 6 . 5 ) before use . An equal volume of 100 nM IAF - labeled chicken cys - cofilin ( Nagaoka et al . , 1995 ) in F - buffer ( pH 6 . 5 ) was applied ( final con - centration of 50 nM ) . IAF - labeled cofilin and rhodamine - labeled F - actin were observed under TIRF microscopy . The mean time constant of the photobleach - ing of IAF - labeled cofilin was 5 . 0 ± 0 . 8 s ( n = 4 ) under these recording condi - tions . The rate of the association of cofilin ( 50 nM ) with the glass surface that had been blocked by casein was very low ( 0 . 0001 events / s in 1 µm 2 of glass surface and 50 nM cofilin ) , suggesting that the nonspecific binding of cofilin with the glass surface coated by NEM - myosin was negligible . The images were recorded 10 – 15 s after scratching the meshwork with a pipette tip . When 1 µg / ml of fluorescent Alexa Fluor 488 BSA was used as a control , no apparent binding of fluorescent BSA to the actin meshwork was detected under our experimental conditions . We examined the actin - binding activity of the IAF - cofilin by cosedi - mentation assay ( Nagaoka et al . , 1995 ) . As Fig . S1 shows , IAF - cofilin was cosedimented with F - actin at pH 8 . 4 and 7 . 0 . As this property is comparable with those of the recombinant human cofilin ( Fig . S1 , lanes a and b ) , we conclude that the IAF - cofilin possesses basically the same binding activity as the nonlabeled native cofilin . In addition , the depoly - merizing activity of IAF - cofilin was also detected but was reduced com - pared with the native cofilin ; actin was present in the supernatant together with IAF - cofilin after ultracentrifugation , but the Coomassie brilliant blue staining was fainter than the staining of recombinant human cofilin . Colocalization of actin and cofilin was made by using the measure colocalization feature of MetaMorph software ( Molecular Devices ) . The fluorescence intensity of each pixel was measured at first , and the pixels with high fluorescence intensities ( 10 % of pixels ) were chosen for actin and for cofilin and were processed by measure colocalization . Distribution of GFP - cofilin ( expression vector for the GFP - cofilin fusion protein was a gift from T . Obinata ) was imaged with a standard epifluores - cence microscope equipped with Cascade512 charge - coupled device cam - era for time - lapse imaging . The number of cells with GFP - cofilin translocated to actin stress fibers was counted in each microscopic field between 20 and 90 s from the onset of relaxing the elastic substratum ( 20 % ) , which was pre - stretched before plating cells . The cells endowed with more than two fila - mentous GFP - cofilin ( 5 – 20 µm in length ) were considered positive for translocation of GFP - cofilin to stress fibers ( as shown in Fig . 4 ) . One to three cells were in the field of the microscope , and images were taken every 1 s . We sometimes used the FFT filtering function of ImageJ ( National Institutes of Health ) to remove interference patterns if necessary . 727 Actin filaments function as a tension sensor • Hayakawa et al .
