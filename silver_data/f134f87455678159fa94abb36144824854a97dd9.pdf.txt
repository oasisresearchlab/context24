This RGS - like ( RGL ) domain provides a functional motif by which G a 12 and G a 13 can bind and regulate the activity of these RhoGEFs , thus providing a direct link from these heterotrimeric G proteins to Rho . PDZ - RhoGEF and LARG can also be phosphorylated by tyrosine kinases , including FAK , and associate with Plexin B , a semaphorin receptor , which controls axon guidance during develop - ment , through their PDZ domain , thereby stimulating Rho . Interestingly , while characterizing a PDZ - RhoGEF antiserum , we found that a transfected PDZ - RhoGEF construct associated with the endogenous PDZ - RhoGEF . Indeed , we observed that PDZ - RhoGEF and LARG can form homo - and hetero - oligomers , whereas p115RhoGEF can only homo - oligomerize , and that this intermolecular interaction was mediated by their unique C - terminal regions . Deletion of the C - terminal tail of PDZ - RhoGEF had no signiﬁcant effect on the GEF catalytic activity towards Rho in vitro , but resulted in a drastic increase in the ability to stimulate a serum response element reporter and the accumulation of the GTP - bound Rho in vivo . Furthermore , removal of the C - termini of each of the three RGL - containing GEFs unleashed their full transforming potential . Together , these ﬁndings suggest the existence of a novel mechanism controlling the activity of PDZ - RhoGEF , LARG , and p115RhoGEF , which involves homo - and hetero - oligomerization through their inhibitory C - terminal region .

For example , when microinjected into Swiss 3T3 ﬁbroblasts , activated Rho rapidly induces the formation of actin stress ﬁbers and focal contacts ( Ridley and Hall , 1992 ) , and activated alleles of Rho induce gene expression from the serum response element ( SRE ) through the activation of the serum response factor ( SRF ) ( Hill et al . , 1995 ) . Furthermore , Rho proteins also play a key role in a number of cellular processes that involve intracellular membrane trafﬁcking , such as phagocytosis , endocytosis , and secretory vesicle trans - port ( Takai et al . , 2001 ) . The functional activity of Rho is controlled by the combined activities of guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( GEFs ) , GDP - dissociation inhibitors ( GDIs ) and GTPase activating proteins ( GAPs ) that act as positive or negative regulators of Rho - like proteins . Most GEFs for Rho GTPases include a highly conserved structural motif consisting of a 250 - amino - acid stretch of sequence similarity with Dbl , known as Dbl homology ( DH ) domain , adjacent to a pleckstrin homology ( PH ) domain ( Whitehead et al . , 1997 ; Schmidt and Hall , 2002 ) . In vivo , the DH domain interacts with the inactive , GDP - bound GTPases and promotes the release of GDP and its subsequent exchange for GTP , thereby activating Rho proteins . The GEF activity of Dbl family members , such as Dbl , Ost , Lfc , Lbc , Vav , Ect2 , Tim , and Net , can be activated upon stimulation of a number of cell surface receptors , including growth factor receptors , cytokine receptors , and cell to cell or cell to extracellular matrix adhesion molecules , thus acting as part of a signaling route by which extracellular stimuli can regulate the activity of Rho GTPases ( Zheng , 2001 ; Schmidt and Hall , 2002 ) . Available evidence indicates that a recently described family of DH domain - containing proteins that includes p115RhoGEF , PDZ - RhoGEF ( PRG ) , and LARG can transduce signals from receptors coupled to the hetero - trimeric G proteins G 12 and G 13 to Rho ( Hart et al . , Received 29 May 2003 ; revised 9 July 2003 ; accepted 14 July 2003 * Correspondence : Oral and Pharyngeal Cancer Branch , National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research , National Institutes of Health , 9000 Rockville Pike , Building 30 , Room 211 , Bethesda , MD 20892 - 4330 , USA ; E - mail : sg39v @ nih . gov This article is a ‘United States Government Work’ paper as deﬁned by the US Copyright Act Oncogene ( 2004 ) 23 , 233 – 240 & 2004 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved 0950 - 9232 / 04 $ 25 . 00 www . nature . com / onc 1998 ; Fukuhara et al . , 1999 , 2000 ) . These three GEFs contain an area of limited similarity to a conserved region of regulator of G protein signaling ( RGS ) in their N - terminal region ( Fukuhara et al . , 2001 ; Longenecker et al . , 2001 ) . RGS proteins function as GAPs for G proteins enhancing their rate of GTP hydrolysis . Indeed , the RGS - like ( RGL ) domain of p115RhoGEF can accelerate the GTPase activity of G 12 / 13 ( Kozasa et al . , 1998 ) . In addition to this regulatory activity , the RGL domain of these RhoGEFs provides a structural motif by which G 12 / 13 proteins can form molecular complexes with these RhoGEFs , thereby enhancing their activity ( Hart et al . , 1998 ; Fukuhara et al . , 1999 , 2000 ) . Thus , this newly discovered family of RGL - domain containing RhoGEFs , p115RhoGEF , PRG , and LARG provide a direct functional link from G 12 , G 13 , and their coupled cell surface receptors to Rho ( Fukuhara et al . , 2001 ) . However , the nature of the molecular mechanisms controlling the activity of these Rho - GEFs is yet not fully understood . For example , recently reported evi - dence indicates that two of these RGL - containing RhoGEFs , PRG and LARG , can be phosphorylated in tyrosine residues by FAK in response to agonist stimulating G proteins ( Chikumi et al . , 2002 ) , and that these RhoGEFs can associate through their PDZ domain to insulin - like growth factor receptors ( Taya et al . , 2001 ) and Plexin B ( Aurandt et al . , 2002 ; Perrot et al . , 2002 ; Swiercz et al . , 2002 ) , the latter a semaphorin receptor which controls axon guidance during develop - ment . Additionally , G 12 / 13 binding to the RGL domain of p115RhoGEF was shown to partially activate its GEF activity towards Rho , suggesting that the N - terminus of p115RhoGEF may impose an autoinhibi - tion on the DH / PH module ( Hart et al . , 1998 ) . However , whether the latter is indeed the case still remains unclear . In this study , we observed that the RGL - containing RhoGEFs , PRG , LARG , and p115 RhoGEF , oligomer - ize through their C - termini . Furthermore , we found that PRG and LARG can also form heteromolecular com - plexes , while p115RhoGEF can only associate with itself but not with PRG or LARG . We also present evidence that although the C - terminal region has no detectable effect on the catalytic GEF activity in vitro , removal of the C - terminus of these RGL - containing RhoGEFs results in a remarkable increase in their ability to induce RhoA activation in vivo . Furthermore , deletion of the C - terminal region increases their ability to induce Rho - dependent transcriptional responses and promotes neo - plastic transformation . Thus , the C - terminus of the RGL - containing RhoGEFs may act as a negative regulatory region by which these GEFs can homo - or hetero - oligomerize and recruit additional cellular factors to modulate their Rho activating potential in cells . Results To begin exploring the molecular mechanisms regulat - ing the activity of PRG , we developed a PRG antiserum against a C - terminal peptide , and characterized it upon expression of PRG in Human kidney 293T ( HEK - 293T ) cells . As shown in Figure 1a , the PRG antibody recognized PRG but not other AU1 - tagged members of the RGL - containing RhoGEF family , LARG and p115RhoGEF , which were readily detected by an anti - epitope antibody . Furthermore , this antiserum immu - noprecipitated endogenous as well as transfected PRG , and its speciﬁcity was conﬁrmed by preincubating the antiserum with the peptide that was used as an immunogen ( Figure 1b ) . As expected , this antibody recognized a HA tagged C - terminal fragment of PRG , but failed to detect a PRG C - terminal deletion mutant ( Figure 1c ) . Surprisingly , we observed that the trans - fected PRG full length and its C - terminus coimmuno - precipitated with the endogenous PRG ( Figure 1c ) , thus suggesting that PRG may form oligomeric molecular complexes . To address which structural domain participates in the oligomerization of PRG , we expressed a N - terminal GFP - tagged PRG together with a number of deletion mutants , lacking parts of its N - terminus ( - 127 , 238 , 702 , - 958 ) , its C terminus ( - C ) , or its catalytic region ( - DH / PH , - PH ) , or containing only some of its functional domains ( PDZ / RGS , DH / PH , and PDG - C terminus ) ( Figure 2a ) . The expression of GFP - PRG and the AU1 - or HA - tagged PRG constructs in HEK - 293T was Figure 1 Characterization of a PRG antiserum reveals that PRG forms oligomeric molecular complexes . HEK - 293T cells were transfected with plasmids for AU1 PRG , AU1 LARG and AU1 p115 RhoGEF , and lysates were analysed by Western blotting with anti - AU1 or anti - PRG antibodies ( Panel a ) . Untransfected HEK - 293T cells and AU1 PRG transfected HEK - 293T cells were immunopreciated with anti - PRG antibody with and without ( þ ; (cid:2) ) blocking peptide and Western blotted with the anti - PRG serum ( Panel b ) . Lysates of HEK - 293T cells were transfected with PRG wt or - C , and PRG C - terminal was immunoprecipitated with anti - AU1 or anti - HA antibody and used for Western blot analysis with the anti - PRG serum ( right ) , and then the same membrane was probed with a mix of HA and AU1 antibodies ( left ) ( Panel c ) . Arrows indicate the location of endogenous or transfected PRG Regulation of RGL - containing RhoGEFs H Chikumi et al 234 Oncogene conﬁrmed using the corresponding anti - tag antibodies . As shown in Figure 2a , GFP - PRG coimmunoprecipi - tated with wild - type PRG and each of its mutants , as long as they included the C - terminal region of PRG , independently of the presence or absence of any other region or structural domain . In line with these observa - tions , we found that when the C - terminal region of PRG was expressed as fusions of two different tags , HA and AU5 , respectively , they form complexes that could be coimmunoprecipitated by either anti - tag antibody ( Figure 2b ) . Thus , the C - terminal region of ( amino acids 1181 – 1522 ) PRG is necessary and sufﬁcient to promote the formation of oligomeric molecular complexes . The nature of the precise residues participat - ing in this process is under current investigation . In this regard , the fact that the C - terminal PRG antibody does not prevent PRG oligomerization suggests that residues 1401 – 1414 and their adjacent region may not be critical for this interaction . Next , we asked whether other member of the RGL - containing RhoGEFs would be able to form oligomers . For these experiments , we engineered AU1 - tagged expression vectors for the full length , N - terminal deleted and C - terminal deleted forms of LARG and p115 RhoGEF , as well as an EGFP - tagged form of each of their full - length constructs . As shown in Figure 3 , all three RGL - containing RhoGEFs were able to homo - oligomerize , and this property was strictly dependent on the availability of their C - terminal regions . We then explored whether these RhoGEFs could form hetero - oligomers . Surprisingly , PRG and LARG could hetero - oligomerize with each other , as judged by the ability to coimmunoprecipitate the GFP - tagged form of PRG and LARG with the AU1 tagged form of LARG and PRG , respectively . In contrast , p115 RhoGEF could only homo - oligomerize , as it did not associate with the other members of this RhoGEF family ( Figure 4a ) . These observations were conﬁrmed by coexpressing the GFP tagged GEFs with constructs expressing their C - termini . Indeed , as shown in Figure 4b , the isolated C - terminus of PRG associated with PRG and LARG but not p115 RhoGEF ; the LARG C - terminus coimmunoprecipitated only with PRG and LARG ; and the C - terminus of p115 RhoGEF associated exclusively with its full - length molecule . Together , these data indicate that PRG and LARG can homo - and hetero - oligomerize , while p115 RhoGEF can only associate through homophilic interactions .

( Panel b ) , HEK - 293T cells were transfected with expression plasmids for HA PRG C - terminal ( amino acids 1181 – 1522 ) ( HA - PRG - C ) and AU5 PRG C - terminal ( amino acids 1181 – 1522 ) ( AU5 - PRG - C ) alone or together . Lysates from transfected cells were immunoprecipitated with anti - AU5 antibody or anti - HA antibody , and subjected to Western blot ( WB ) analysis with each of these antibodies , as indicated . The corresponding total cellular lysates ( TCL ) were also subjected to Western blot analysis using anti - AU5 and anti - HA antibodies Figure 3 Homo - oligomerization of RGL - containing RhoGEFs . HEK - 293T cells were transfected with expression plasmids for AU1 tagged forms of PRG , LARG , and p115 RhoGEF , either wild - type ( wt ) or their N - terminal ( N ) or C - terminal ( C ) deletion mutants , or empty vector ( control ) , together with GFP tagged PRG , LARG , and p115 RhoGEF , as indicated . Lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti - AU1 antibodies and subjected to Western blot analysis with antibodies against GFP . TCL were also subjected to Western blot analysis using AU1 and GFP antibodies . Arrows indicate the corresponding AU1 - tagged proteins Regulation of RGL - containing RhoGEFs H Chikumi et al 235 Oncogene To evaluate whether the oligomerization of these GEFs through their C - terminal region might modulate their catalytic GEF activity , we overexpressed a panel of PRG mutants as well as wild - type PRG in 293T cells as AU1 - fusions and puriﬁed them to homogeneity by using anti - AU1 afﬁnity chromatography ( Figure 5a ) . When equal molar quantities ( 0 . 2 m m ) of the puriﬁed PRG , the C - terminal deletion mutant ( PRG C ) , the N - terminal deletion mutant ( PRG N ) , and the DH / PH module were examined in an in vitro GTP / GDP exchange reaction , we found that the removal of either N - or C - terminal region had a very minor effect , if any , on the PRG’s ability to stimulate [ 3 H ] GDP dissociation from RhoA ( Figure 5b ) . Furthermore , they behaved similarly in altering the kinetics of GDP - dissociation of RhoA at increasing concentrations ( data not shown ) . These results suggest that oligomerization by the C - terminal region of PRG does not affect the in vitro catalytic GEF activity of the DH / PH module . Moreover , the N - terminal RGL - domain also does not appear to directly impose a signiﬁcant autoinhibition . To assess the functional consequences of these ﬁndings in vivo , we next examined whether deletion of the C - terminal region of the GEFs , that prevents oligomerization , can affect their ability to stimulate Rho and Rho - downstream pathways in cellular systems . For the latter , we took advantage of the observation that RGL - containing RhoGEFs activate the transcrip - tional activity of the c - fos SRE ( Fukuhara et al . , 1999 ; Shi et al . , 2000 ) . Indeed , all three members of this GEF family stimulated luciferase expression from the SRE Figure 4 Homo - and hetero - oligomerization of RGL - containing RhoGEFs . HEK - 293T cells were transfected with expression plasmids for AU1 - tagged PRG , LARG and p115 RhoGEF , or vector alone ( Control ) together with GFP - tagged forms of PRG , LARG , or p115 RhoGEF , as indicated . Cellular lysates were immunoprecipitated ( IP ) with anti - AU1 antibodies and subjected to Western blot analysis with antibodies against GFP . TCL were also subjected to Western blot analysis using anti - AU1 and anti - GFP antibodies ( Panel a ) . HEK - 293T cells were also transfected with expression plasmids for HA - tagged C - terminal region of PRG ( PRG - C ) , LARG ( LARG - C ) , and p115 RhoGEF ( p115 - C ) together with GFP - tagged PRG , LARG , or p115 RhoGEF . Lysates were processed as for Panel a , but using an anti - HA antibody for immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis ( Panel b ) Figure 5 Analysis of the GEF activity of PRG and its deletion mutants toward RhoA in vitro . Panel a : The cDNAs encoding the wild - type PRG , the DH / PH module , the N - terminal truncation ( PRG N ) , or the C - terminal truncation ( PRG C ) were transiently expressed in 293T cells by using the pCEFL vector . The Coomassie - blue stained SDS – PAGE shows B 0 . 5 m g puriﬁed AU1 - fusion proteins loaded on each lane . Panel b : The time courses of the PRG or mutant - stimulated GDP dissociation from RhoA . A measure of 1 m m [ 3 H ] GDP loaded RhoA was incubated with 0 . 2 m m wild - type PRG or the respective mutants in the GEF reaction buffer containing 2m m Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 6 , 10m m NaCl , 1m m MgCl 2 , m m DTT , and 0 . m m GTP . At the indicated time points , aliquots of samples were withdrawn for quantiﬁcation by passing through nitrocellulose ﬁlters . The radioactive counts of RhoA - [ 3 H ] GDP at 0min were taken at 100 % . Data are represen - tative of three independent experiments Regulation of RGL - containing RhoGEFs H Chikumi et al 236 Oncogene reporter plasmid , as shown in Figure 6a . Interestingly , the C - terminal deletion mutants of PRG ( PRG C ) , LARG ( LARG C ) , and p115 ( p115 C ) stimulated the SRE activity much more potently than their correspond - ing wild - type molecules ( Figure 6a ) . In line with this observation , the ability of these C - terminal deletion mutants to promote the accumulation of endogenous RhoA in its GTP - bound active state was also drama - tically increased when compared to that of the corresponding wild types ( Figure 6b ) . These ﬁndings indicate that the C - terminal regions of RGL - containing RhoGEFs , which participate in the formation of oligomeric complexes , can limit the activity of these GEFs in vivo and display an inhibitory effect . Activated RhoA ( RhoA QL ) induces the appearance of transformed foci when expressed in NIH 3T3 cells ( Zohar et al . , 1998 ) . In line with this observation , we have recently shown that PRG , LARG , and p115Rho - GEF harbor transforming potential ( Fukuhara et al . , 2001 ) . Of interest , while PRG induced the appearance of Rho - like foci when transfected in NIH 3T3 cells , deletion of its C - terminal region enhanced its focus forming activity by more than twofold , which was now comparable to the potency exhibited by the active form of RhoA ( Figure 7 , Table 1 ) . Similarly , C - terminal deletion dramatically increased the transforming poten - tial of LARG and p115 Rho GEF ( Table 1 ) , which is consistent with the transcriptional and in vivo Rho - activating data , thus supporting the biological relevance of the negative regulatory activity exerted by the C - terminal region of the RGL - containing Rho GEFs . Figure 6 Activation of RGL - containing RhoGEF by deletion of their C - terminal region . HEK - 293T cells were transfected with pSRE Luc together with expression plasmids for PRG , LARG , p115 RhoGEF , or their respective C - terminal deletion mutants ( C ) . Cells were serum starved , and lysates processed for Luciferase assay as described under ‘Experimental procedures . ’ The data represent Luc activity are the mean 7 s . e . of triplicate samples from a typical experiment , which was repeated three times with nearly identical results ( Panel a ) . Parallel samples excluding the reporter construct were incubated with GST - RBD beads to afﬁnity precipitate GTP - bound Rho . The beads were washed and the total amount of Rho in each cell lysate ( total Rho ) and Rho bound to the beads ( GTP - Rho ) was analysed by Western blotting with a monoclonal antibody against RhoA ( Panel b ) Figure 7 Oncogenic activation of PRG by C - terminal deletion . NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with empty vector ( control ) or an expression plasmid for activated RhoA ( RhoA QL ) ( 1 m g per plate ) , PRG ( 1 m g per plate ) , PRG C ( 1 m g per plate ) , LARG ( 1 m g per plate ) , LARG C ( 1 m g per plate ) , p115 RhoGEF ( 1 m g per plate ) , and p115 RhoGEF C ( 1 m g per plate ) . Cells were stained 3 weeks after transfection . Representative plates are depicted . Foci of transformation were counted in triplicate plates in independent transfections , and the number of foci per g of transfected DNA for each construct is documented in Table 1 Table 1 Focus - forming activity of wild - type and C - terminal deletion mutants of PDZ RhoGEF , LARG , and p115 RhoGEF DNA construct Focus - forming activity per m g of DNA PCEF AU1 o 1 pCEF AU5 RhoA QL 90 7 13 pCEF AU1 PRG 29 7 8 pCEF AU1 PRG D C 68 7 4 pCEF AU1 LARG 34 7 4 pCEF AU1 LARG D C 57 7 10 pCEF AU1 p115 Rho GEF 5 7 2 pCEF AU1 p115 Rho GEF D C 105 7 15 Vector alone , wild - type , or C - terminal deleted forms of PRG , LARG , and p115 Rho GEF plasmid DNAs were transfected into NIH 3T3 cells . Cultures were scored for focus formation 2 – 3 weeks after transfection . Data shown represent mean values 7 s . e . of triplicate plates from three independent experiments Regulation of RGL - containing RhoGEFs H Chikumi et al 237 Oncogene Discussion PRG , LARG , and p115RhoGEF deﬁne a distinct RhoGEF subfamily , which is characterized by the presence of an RGL domain by which they can bind heterotrimeric G protein subunits of the G 12 family , thereby regulating their GEF activity towards Rho ( Fukuhara et al . , 2001 ) . These RhoGEFs can be further regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation ( Chikumi et al . , 2002 ) , and two of these GEFs , PRG and LARG , can be activated through the association of their PDZ domains with insulin - like growth factor receptor or the cytoplas - mic tail of Plexin B ( Taya et al . , 2001 ; Aurandt et al . , 2002 ; Perrot et al . , 2002 ; Swiercz et al . , 2002 ) . During the course of characterizing a PRG - speciﬁc antiserum , we discovered that this GEF can form oligomers through its C - terminal region . Similar behavior was observed for LARG and p115 RhoGEF . PRG and LARG , but not p115 RhoGEF , were also found to hetero - oligomerize . Interestingly , deletion of the C - terminal region did not affect the GEF activity of PRG in vitro , but deletion of this region prevented the formation of homo - or hetero - oligomeric molecular complexes . It also resulted in the enhanced GEF activity of PRG , LARG , and p115RhoGEF in vivo and unleashed the full transforming potential of these GEFs . Thus , this family of RhoGEF may also share the presence of an inhibitory C - terminal region by which they can form oligomeric molecular complexes and likely recruit inhibitory factors in cells . The use of intra - and intermolecular interactions as a mechanism for regulating molecular activity is wide - spread in biological system . Recent accumulating evidence suggests that these mechanisms , which include protein – protein and protein – lipid interactions , may provide the bases for a regulatory network controlling the activity of the Dbl family of RhoGEFs ( reviewed in Zheng ( 2001 ) . Among them , perhaps the best under - stood mechanisms are those controlling the conforma - tion and / or localization of the DH - PH domains or their accessibility to bind and stimulate nucleotide exchange on Rho GTPases . This process is best illustrated by Vav1 , whose activity is tightly controlled by tyrosine phosphorylation ( Crespo et al . , 1997 ; Teramoto et al . , 1997 ) . For example , Vav1 is phosphorylated in Tyr174 by Src family tyrosine kinases after cytokine or adhesion receptor activation , and this phosphorylation leads to its activation ( Bustelo , 2000 ) . Structural analysis revealed that Tyr174 lies at the center of an inhibitory helix that binds a complementary cleft on a conserved face of the DH domain , thus hindering the access to its GTPase - binding site . Phosphorylation of this tyrosine affects the intramolecular binding interfase , as well as destabilizes the helical structure of this inhibitory region , both contributing to the release of the auto - inhibitory interaction , which results in the upregulation of the GEF activity of Vav1 ( Aghazadeh et al . , 2000 ) . In the case of proto - Dbl , intermolecular interactions between its N terminus and the PH domain maintains it in an auto - inhibited , inactive state , by limiting the access of RhoA and Cdc42 to the catalytic site of the DH domain ( Aghazadeh et al . , 2000 ) . The DH - PH domain of Vav , as well as that of Sos1 , can also be regulated through the interaction of phospholipids with the PH domain . For example , the PI3K product phosphoinositol ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) trisphosphate binds to their PH domain and appears to alleviate an inhibitory effect of the PH domain on the DH domain ( Han et al . , 1998 ; Nimnual et al . , 1998 ) . By contrast , the GEF activity of Dbl towards Cdc42 was found to be inhibited by either phosphoinositol ( 4 , 5 ) diphosphate or phospohoinositol ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) trisphosphate binding to the PH domain ( Russo et al . , 2001 ) . These ﬁndings suggest that phosphatidylinositol phospholipids can regulate , either in a positive or negative fashion , the intramolecular interaction between the DH and PH domains . In addition to intramolecular interactions and their regulation by phosphorylation or lipid binding , many Rho GEFs exhibit a number of conserved structural domains that are also present in other signal transducing molecules , which enable regulatory interactions that ultimately modulate the GEF activity of the DH domain ( Cerione and Zheng , 1996 ) . One example is Tiam1 , which was recently found to contain a Ras - binding domain ( Ponting , 1999 ) and therefore activates Rac1 in response to Ras stimulation ( Lambert et al . , 2002 ) . That also includes the regulation of p115RhoGEF , PRG , and LARG by G 13 through their RGL domain , presumably by releasing an inhibitory constraint on the DH domain ( Hart et al . , 1998 ) . However , the fact that deletion of the N - terminal PDZ and RGL domains from PRG does not appear to affect the GEF catalytic activity as assayed in a puriﬁed system suggests that the N - terminus does not constitute an autoinhibitory region , and that the regulatory binding to the N - terminus by G 13 , for example , may not be per se sufﬁcient to regulate their GEF catalytic function . Our recent observations that palmitoylation - deﬁcient G 12 and G 13 bind PRG but fail to promote Rho activation in vivo ( JSG , unpublished results ) further suggest that the G 12 / 13 interaction with PDZ - RhoGEF may serve as a targeting signal for the effective regulation of the GEF function . Interestingly , we now show that RGL - containing RhoGEFs can form oligomers by intermolecular inter - actions through their inhibitory C - terminal domain , which may thereby regulate their activity in vivo . Similar to this observation , Kim et al . have shown that the Cdc42 / Rac1 GEF , p21 - activated kinase interacting factor PIX , uses its C - terminal end to form homodimers in vitro and in vivo through a leucine zipper domain ( Kim et al . , 2001 ) . Deletion of the leucine zipper domain and the resulting loss of homo - oligomerization pre - vented , rather than stimulating , Pix function in vivo ( Kim et al . , 2001 ) . In other cases , oligomerization has also been reported to occur through DH - DH domain interactions , such as for RasGRF1 , RasGRF2 , and Dbl ( Anborgh et al . , 1999 ; Zhu et al . , 2001 ) . In these cases , inhibition of oligomerization diminishes the in vivo GEF activity of Dbl for Cdc42 and Rho , and that of RasGEF1 and RasGEF2 for Ras . Thus , distinct GEFs can use conserved regulatory domains to promote their oligomerization , and the ability to form Regulation of RGL - containing RhoGEFs H Chikumi et al 238 Oncogene oligomers may serve as an important mode of regulation in vivo . In contrast to PIX , Dbl , RasGEF1 , and RasGEF2 , no distinguishable conserved domains are present in the C - terminal region of PRG , LARG , and p115 RhoGEF , other than a predictable coiled – coiled structure for p115RhoGEF but not for PRG and LARG ( J Sondek , personal communication ) . Indeed , their C - termini are quite distinct , and are one of the most divergent regions among these three otherwise related GEFs . In addition , the C - terminal - mediated oligomerization of RGL - con - taining RhoGEFs is inhibitory in nature , rather than required for Rho activation . In turn , how the C - terminal oligomerization inhibits the function of these RhoGEFs is still unknown . Our ﬁndings suggest that the C - terminal region does not bind the DH - PH domain or any other N - terminal regulatory region . In line with these observations , coexpression of the isolated C - terminus does not inhibit the in vivo GEF activity of p115RhoGEF , PRG or LARG , or their C - terminal deletion mutants ( not shown ) . In addition , binding of G 13 to their RGL domain does not disrupt their oligomerization , nor the absence of the C - terminal region affects the overall cellular distribution of these GEFs , which is primarily cytoplasmic ( unpublished observations ) . However , whether C - terminal deletion promotes the localization of these GEFs to a particular subcellular fraction or membrane microdomain , or its enhanced colocalization with Rho warrants further investigation . On the other hand , the clear difference in Rho - activating potential of the full - length PRG and the C - terminal deleted PRG in vivo suggests that the C - terminal region of this GEF may interact with yet to be identiﬁed negative regulatory molecules that can be brought into close proximity to the catalytic DH - PH domain by virtue of this interaction . We can conclude that the recently described family of RGL - containing RhoGEFs shares the presence of a functionally but not structurally related C - terminal region . The function of this region appears to be complex , as it participates in homo - or hetero - oligomer - ization and may also recruit additional cellular factors resulting in the downregulation of their GEF activity in vivo . These ﬁndings provide a likely mechanism by which the activity of these GEFs is restricted under basal conditions , thus preventing the manifestation of their Rho - activating and oncogenic potential . They also raise the possibility of the existence of both positive and negative pathways that may control the activity of this GEF family by acting on their inhibitory C - termini or through the regulation of their oligomeric state . Materials and methods Expression plasmids Plasmids expressing AU1 - tagged PRG ( amino acids 1 – 1522 ) , LARG ( amino acids 1 – 1544 ) , p115RhoGEF ( amino acids 1 – 912 ) and deletion mutant forms of PRG ( - 127 - 238 - 702 - 956 - DH / PH , - PH ) , and cDNAs encoding amino acids 1 – 1160 of PRG ( - C ) , 1 – 702 of PRG ( PDZ / RGS ) , 702 – 1160 of PRG ( DH / PH ) , AU5 - tagged RhoA QL , as well as the pSRE Luc reporter plasmid were described previously ( Zohar et al . , 1998 ; Fukuhara et al . , 1999 , 2000 ; Chikumi et al . , 2002 ) . C - terminal HA - tagged or AU5 - tagged forms of C - terminal region of PRG ( amino acids 1181 – 1522 ) , LARG ( amino acids 1141 – 1544 ) and p115 ( amino acids 771 – 912 ) , AU1 - tagged LARG - C ( amino acids 1 – 1160 ) , and p115 RhoGEF - C ( amino acids 1 – 800 ) , as well as AU - 1 tagged PRG - N ( amino acids 702 – 1522 ) , LARG - N ( amino acids 641 – 1544 ) , and p115RhoGEF - N ( amino acids 351 – 912 ) were generated by polymerase chain reaction using their corresponding cDNAs as a template . pGEX expression vector encoding glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) fusion protein that contains the isolated GTP - dependent binding domain of the RhoA effector rhotekin ( rhotekin RBD ) was provided by Dr S Narumiya ( Reid et al . , 1996 ) . Cell lines and transfection HEK - 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum . Tissue culture plates were treated with phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) containing 20 mg / ml poly - d - lysine for 15 min before seeding the cells , to prevent them from detaching from the plates when in serum - free conditions . Cells were trans - fected using LipofectAMINE Plus TM reagent ( Life Technol - ogies , Inc . ) according to the manufacturer’s protocol . Reporter gene assay The SRE activity was determined as described previously ( Sakabe et al . , 2002 ) . Brieﬂy , HEK - 293T cells plated in a six - well plate together with 0 . 1 m g of pSRE Luc reporter plasmid . After overnight incubation , the cells were washed with serum - free DMEM , and kept for 24 h in DMEM supplemented with 20 m m HEPES . Cells were then lysed using reporter lysis buffer ( Promega ) . Western blots and immunoprecipitations Cells were lysed at 4 1 C in a buffer containing 25 m m HEPES , pH 7 . 5 , 0 . 3M NaCl , 1 . 5m m MgCl 2 , 0 . 2m m EDTA , 0 . 5m m dithiothreitol ( DTT ) , 1 % Triton X - 100 , 0 . 5 % sodium deox - ycholate , 0 . 1 % SDS , 20 m m b - glycerophosphate , 1 m m sodium vanadate , 1m m phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride , 20 m g / ml apro - tinin , and 20 m g / ml leupeptinin , and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation . For coimmunoprecipitation , ly - sates were incubated with for 1h at 4 1 C with the speciﬁc antibody against AU1 , HA , or AU5 , as indicated . Immuno - complexes were recovered with the aid of Gamma - bound Sepharose beads ( Pharmacia ) . Lysates containing approxi - mately 50g of total cellular protein or immunoprecipitates with the indicated antibodies were analysed by Western blotting after SDS – polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence detection ( Amer - sham Pharmacia Biotech ) using goat anti - mouse ( Cappel or goat anti - rabbit ( Cappel ) IgGs coupled to horseradish peroxidase as a secondary antibody . C - terminal of Anti - PRG serum was raised in rabbits against a C - terminal polypeptide corresponding to amino acids 1401 – 1414 of human PRG ( NP _ 055599 ) . Antibodies against RhoA ( 26C4 ) were pur - chased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology . Monoclonal antibody against HA , AU1 , and AU5 epitope was purchased form COVANCE . In vitro GDP / GTP exchange assay The time courses for [ 3 H ] GDP / GTP exchange of Rho GTPase in the presence or absence of PRG and its mutants were Regulation of RGL - containing RhoGEFs H Chikumi et al 239 Oncogene determined as previously described using the nitrocellulose ﬁltration method ( Hart et al . , 1994 ) . The GEF reaction buffer contains [ 3 H ] GDP - loaded RhoA ( 1 m m ) with 20m m Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 6 , 100 m m NaCl , 10m m MgCl 2 , 0 . 5 m m GTP , and 1 m m DTT supplemented with the indicated amounts of puriﬁed PRG or its mutants . The reactions were terminated at the indicated time points , and the percentages of remaining RhoA bound [ 3 H ] GDP were quantiﬁed . In vivo Rho guanine nucleotide exchange assay In vivo Rho activity was assessed by a modiﬁed method described elsewhere ( Ren et al . , 1999 ) . Brieﬂy , HEK - 293T cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids . After serum starvation for 24h , cells were lysed at 4 1 C in a buffer containing 20m m HEPES , pH 7 . 4 , 0 . 1 m NaCl , 1 % Triton X - 100 , 10 m m EGTA , 40m m b - glycerophosphate , 20 m m MgCl 2 , 1 m m Na 3 VO 4 , 1 m m DTT , 10 m g / ml aprotinin , 10 m g / ml leupeptin , and 1m m phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride . Lysates were incubated with GST fusion protein including the Rho - binding domain ( RBD ) of rhotekin previously bound to glutathione – Sepharose beads , followed by four washes with lysis buffer . GTP - bound forms of Rho associated with GST – rhotekin – RBD were released from beads by addition of protein loading buffer , and quantiﬁed by Western blot analysis using a monoclonal antibody against RhoA ( 26C4 ) ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) . Foci formation in NIH3T3 cells Plasmid DNA transfection of NIH 3T3 cells was performed by the calcium phosphate precipitation technique , and trans - formed foci were scored after 2 – 3 weeks as described ( Zohar et al . , 1998 ) .
