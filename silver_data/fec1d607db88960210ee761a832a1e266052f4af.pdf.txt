Guanine nucleotide - exchange factors ( GEFs ) activate Rho GTPases by promoting their exchange of GDP for GTP . Trio is a unique Rho GEF , because it has separate GEF domains , GEFD1 and GEFD2 , that control the GTPases RhoG / Rac1 and RhoA , respectively . Dbl - homol - ogy ( DH ) domains that are common to GEFs catalyse nucleotide exchange , and pleckstrin - homology ( PH ) domains localize Rho GEFs near their downstream targets . Here we show that Trio GEFD1 interacts through its PH domain with the actin - filament - crosslinking protein filamin , and localizes with endogenous filamin in HeLa cells . Trio GEFD1 induces actin - based ruffling in filamin - expressing , but not filamin - deficient , cells and in cells transfected with a filamin construct that lacks the Trio - binding domain . In addition , Trio GEFD1 exchange activity is not affected by filamin bind - ing . Our results indicate that filamin , as a molecular target of Trio , may be a scaffold for the spatial organization of Rho - GTPase - mediated signalling pathways . S mall GTPases of the Rho family have diverse effects on cellu - lar structure and function 1 . Depending on the cell type , spe - cific Rho GTPases induce particular surface protrusions gen - erated by actin - remodelling reactions that change cell shapes and influence cell adhesion and locomotion 2 , 3 . Rho GTPases also affect the cell cycle and gene transcription , and participate as intermedi - ates in malignant transformation caused by mutant Ras GTPases 4 , 5 . Small GTPases are molecular switches that cycle between an inactive GDP - bound state and an active GTP - bound state . GEFs activate GTPases by accelerating the exchange of GDP for GTP . Rho GEFs invariably share the DH domain , which is responsible for catalytic guanine nucleotide - exchange activity , and the PH domain , which is probably important for determining where in the cell GEFs operate 6 , 7 . Trio is the founding member of an emerging family of Rho GEFs that exchange guanine nucleotides on more than one Rho GTPase 8 . One GEF domain of Trio ( Trio GEFD1 ) activates the small GTPases RhoG and Rac , whereas the other ( Trio GEFD2 ) acts on RhoA , indicating that this Rho GEF may link sev - eral GTPase pathways in vivo 9 , 10 . Recent genetic studies using Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans 11 – 15 have established Trio as a key component of the intracellular signalling pathway that regu - lates axon guidance and cell migration in the nervous system .

These findings highlight the importance of defining the molecular mechanisms that underlie the regulation of the activity of Trio , and especially of its first GEF domain . Because actin reorganization requires spatially controlled assem - bly , disassembly and architectural rearrangement of actin filaments , Rho GTPases that affect it must initiate reactions that ultimately involve actin - binding proteins that function within particular cell domains . Accordingly , although little evidence supports direct effects of GTPases on actin remodelling , accumulating research findings are revealing downstream effects of GTPases on actin - reg - ulating proteins such as myosin kinases , cofilin - regulating kinases , Wiskott – Aldrich - syndrome protein ( WASP ) - family proteins , phos - phoinositide kinases , and proteins of the filamin family 16 – 22 . Filamins are of particular interest , as they have several effects on the actin cytoskeleton . They crosslink actin filaments into orthogonal networks or parallel bundles , tie cortical actin - filament networks to diverse plasma - membrane receptors , and act as a scaffold for intra - cellular signalling cascades 20 , 23 – 25 . Here we show that Trio also binds to filamin and that this interaction has specific consequences for remodelling of the actin cytoskeleton in response to Trio in vivo . Results Trio GEFD1 binds to filamin A . A yeast two - hybrid screen using the Trio GEFD1 domain as bait isolated 17 putative Trio interac - tors . Sequence analysis of eight complementary DNAs revealed that they all encoded truncated polypeptides corresponding to the car - boxy - terminal part of the human protein named ABP - 280 when first cloned and now designated filamin 1 or filamin A ( Fig . 1a ) . Filamin A is the principal human non - muscle isoform of this protein family . It is a flexible homodimer of relative molecular mass 280 , 000 ( M r 280K ) containing an amino - terminal actin - binding domain that precedes 24 immunoglobulin - like b - sheet motifs , the last of which ( repeat 24 ) represents all or part of the self - associa - tion domain of the molecule 26 . The longest filamin cDNA obtained in our two - hybrid screen corresponds to repeats 21 – 24 , encom - passing amino acids 2 , 177 – 2 , 647 ( which we have designated fil1 ) . The smallest cDNA includes part of repeat 23 and the whole of repeat 24 ( amino acids 2 , 458 – 2 , 647 ) , which we have defined as fil4 . Fil4 is sufficient on its own for tight binding to Trio GEFD1 in the two - hybrid system . We investigated the specificity of the interaction of Trio GEFD1 with filamin A and sought to identify the minimum binding domain within Trio by testing the binding of the filamin segment refered to as fil2 ( amino acids 2 , 354 – 2 , 647 ; Fig . 1a ) to other baits in the two - hybrid assay ( Fig . 1b ) . Neither the Trio GEFD2 domain nor the pRB - related pocket protein p130 ( ref . 27 ) interacted with fil2 . Fil2 did not bind to the Trio DH1 domain , indicating that the catalytic domain of Trio GEFD1 is not the region that is responsible for fil - amin binding . This analysis defines a new PH1 - containing func - tional domain on Trio , the filamin - binding domain ( FBD , amino acids 1 , 407 – 1 , 628 ; Fig . 1b ) . Recombinant GEFD1 binds to human filamin in vitro . An enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) - based solid - phase binding assay reported saturable high - affinity ( K d , app » 5 nM ) bind - ing of Trio GEFD1 to both the C terminus of recombinant human filamin A , which was previously designated as fil2 ( Fig . 2a ) and to purified chicken - gizzard filamin 28 ( data not shown ) . In contrast , Trio DH1 and Trio GEFD2 , which lack the Trio FBD , did not bind to fil2 . In a separate approach , recombinant glutathione - S - trans - ferase ( GST ) - tagged GEFD1 , but not GST – Trio DH1 or GST – Trio GEFD2 , bound to filamin from HeLa - cell lysates ( Fig . 2b ) .

Trio GEFD1 and filamin localize in Trio - induced actin structures . As previously described in Swiss 3T3 cells 9 , Trio GEFD1 induces the formation of a distinctive population of serpiginous actin - rich ruf - fles on the dorsal surface of HeLa cells , as shown by rhodamine – phalloidin staining ( data not shown ) , and accumulates in these structures ( Fig . 3a ) . Filamin and Trio GEFD1 concentrated morphologically in these actin - rich structures , as visualized by con - focal microscopy ( Fig . 3c ) . Expression of Trio DH1 in HeLa cells did not affect the morphology of the actin cytoskeleton , indicating that the PH1 domain of Trio may be absolutely required for Trio GEFD1 function in vivo ( Fig . 3d ) . Confocal analysis showed that Trio DH1 exhibited diffuse cytoplasmic staining and did not co - localize with filamin ( Fig . 3d – f ) . Similarly , the PH - domain - con - taining Trio GEFD2 , which promotes formation of actin stress fibres 9 and does not bind to filamin , did not co - localize with fil - amin in HeLa cells ( Fig . 3i ) . Trio GEFD1 - induced ruffle formation requires the presence of fil - amin A . We examined Trio GEFD1 - mediated induction of actin - cytoskeleton modification in a cell line ( M2 ) derived from a human malignant melanoma that does not express minimal detectable fil - amin messenger RNA or protein . M2 cells are extremely defective in translational locomotion and exhibit extensive and prolonged membrane blebbing , a phenotype that is reversed by stable trans - fection of filamin A cDNA ( A7 subline ) 29 . In the majority ( 75 % ) of transfected A7 cells , expression of Trio GEFD1 induced the charac - teristic dorsal ruffles previously observed in 3T3 fibroblasts ( Fig . 4a , b ) . Expression of Trio GEFD1 in filamin - deficient M2 cells , however , although it induced a slight increase in peripheral actin staining in one - third of the transfected cells , failed to elicit the dis - tinctive dorsal ruffles observed in A7 cells ( Fig . 4c , d ) . This filamin - dependent effect seems to be specific for Trio GEFD1 , as expression of the constitutively activated forms of the Trio GEFD1 targets Rac and RhoG , which are GEF - independent , promoted remodelling of the actin cytoskeleton independently of the presence of filamin ( Fig . 4e – h ) . In this case , 72 % of RhoG ( V12 ) - and 73 % of Rac ( V12 ) - transfected M2 cells exhibited GTPase - specific modifi - cation of the actin cytoskeleton . Trio GEFD1 - induced ruffle formation requires its binding to fil - amin A . Expression of Trio GEFD1 also failed to induce actin - asso - ciated membrane changes in M2 cells stably transfected with a a b c d e f g h Figure 4 Filamin A expression is required for Trio GEFD1 - induced actin - cytoskeleton modification . Filamin A - replete ( A7 ) cells were transfected with HA – Trio GEFD1 cDNA ( a , b ) , and filamin A - deficient ( M2 ) cells were transfected with HA – Trio GEFD1 cDNA ( c , d ) , GFP – RhoG ( V12 ) ( e , f ) or GFP – Rac ( V12 ) ( g , h ) 4 days after plating . After fixation and permeabilization , expression of GFP – GTPases was directly visualized ( e , g ) , whereas overexpressed Trio GEFD1 was detected using the anti - HA 12CA5 monoclonal antibody followed by FITC - coupled anti - mouse immunoglobulins ( a , c ) . Filamentous actin was stained with rhodamine – phalloidin ( b , d , f , h ) .

The requirement of these C - terminal 112 amino acids for Trio binding is also demon - strated by the two - hybrid data ( Fig . 5b ) . These results show that the capacity of Trio GEFD1 to remodel the actin cytoskeleton is direct - ly linked to its binding to filamin A . Filamin A is dispensable for JNK activity stimulation by Trio GEFD1 . In addition to its effect on the actin cytoskeleton , Trio GEFD1 activates a Rac - mediated pathway that leads to stimulation of c - Jun kinase ( JNK ) 9 . Previous studies have shown that filamin A binds to the JNK activator SEK1 and is necessary for JNK activation by tumour - necrosis factor - a ( TNF a ) 24 . We monitored the activa - tion of ectopically expressed JNK by Trio GEFD1 in filamin - defi - cient M2 and filamin - replete A7 cells ( Fig . 6 ) . Expression of Trio GEFD1 promoted comparable JNK activation in both filamin - expressing and - deficient cells . Filamin does not affect the exchange activity of Trio GEFD1 . An equal molar amount or a ten - fold excess of either GST – fil2 or puri - fied chicken - gizzard filamin ( data not shown ) did not affect the exchange activity of a submaximally effective concentration of Trio GEFD1 on RhoG ( Fig . 7 ) or Rac ( data not shown ) . Discussion We have identified a new functional domain of 220 amino acids on Trio that is responsible for its binding to filamin . This FBD consists of the PH1 domain of Trio flanked by short N - and C - terminal sequences . These sequences resemble those of the N - terminal PH domain of the Rac - specific GEF , Tiam , which function in concert with adjacent sequences to localize Tiam at the plasma membrane 30 . Whether these surrounding sequences physically participate in fil - amin binding or are necessary for the structural integrity of the Trio PH1 domain is not clear at present . PH domains are present in many proteins that are implicated in signal - transduction cascades and are essential for the proper subcel - lular localization of these proteins . Various PH domains bind in vitro to membrane phosphoinositides 31 , and Trio PH1 binds to phos - phatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate 32 . Some PH domains , however , are also ligands for proteins , such as the heterotrimeric GTPase bg sub - units or filamentous actin 33 , 34 . We have shown that Trio PH1 estab - lishes a functional molecular link between Trio and its particular effects on the actin cytoskeleton , through the protein filamin . Moreover , we have demonstrated that this association is required for Trio GEFD1 - mediated remodelling of the actin cytoskeleton . In con - trast , Trio GEFD1 - elicited activation of JNK is independent of fil - amin , demonstrating a functional dichotomy between Trio GEFD1 - induced downstream signalling pathways at the Rho GEF level . Similarly , the association of the Cdc42 - specific GEF frabin with actin through its actin - binding domain is reportedly essential for forma - tion of actin microspikes but not for JNK activation 35 . The extraordinary ability of Rho GTPases to coordinate functions of unrelated actin - binding proteins to remodel actin - based struc - tures at the cell surface requires exquisite spatial coordination . A scaf - fold on which various components instructed by the GTPases could assemble is one mechanism by which this kind of organization could be accomplished , and filamin is an attractive candidate for providing such support . Filamins crosslink actin filaments into gel - like struc - tures and also link the peripheral actin cytoskeleton to transmem - brane receptors that are involved in physiological processes such as motility , adhesion or cell - shape changes 23 , 25 , 36 – 38 . Mutations in the fil - amin A gene on the X chromosome are responsible for the human genetic disorder periventricular heterotopia , which results from migrational defects of a subset of cortical neurons during embryon - ic development 39 . The fact that both Trio and filamin are involved in the control of neuronal development strongly reinforces the physio - logical significance of the Trio – filamin interaction presented here . Accordingly , filamin and Trio have been localized to nerve growth cones , where Rho GTPases have previously been proposed to control actin dynamics leading to growth - cone guidance 12 , 40 , 41 . In addition , filamin A binds to several GTPases , including Rac1 , Cdc42 , RhoA and RalA 21 , 24 . Of these interactions , only the binding of RalA to filamin is GTP - dependent 21 , indicating that fil - amin has a specific effector function for RalA . We have shown that filamin is dispensable for cytoskeletal rearrangements induced by the unregulated activated forms of RhoG and Rac1 . These data , together with our observation that filamin binding does not affect the in vitro exchange activity of Trio GEFD1 , strongly support a scaffolding function for filamin in the pathway that links Trio to its distinctive effects on the actin cytoskeleton . In such a model , Rho GTPases would localize on filamin irrespective of their bound guanine nucleotide , and wait for activators such as Trio to turn them on and for other effectors to inactivate them . The jux - taposition of a Rac - activating GEF and Rac on a filamin template positions potential Rac activation to stimulate nucleation of actin polymerization 42 at sites where newly assembled actin filaments can be crosslinked , ligated to membrane partners 43 or otherwise modified .

For the two - hybrid experiments , cDNAs encoding different segments of Trio ( Fig . 1b ) were inserted into the pPC97 plasmid 44 , as was a control pPC97 - p130 construct 27 . Recombinant GST - fusion proteins were engineered by subcloning appropriate cDNAs into the pGEX5X vector ( Pharmacia ) . For expres - sion in mammalian cells , cDNAs encoding GEFD1 , DH1 or GEFD2 were inserted into the pSR a HA - Tag vector . GFP - tagged GTPase constructs were as described 3 . The pGEX - cjun and pSR a HA - JNK con - structs were supplied by B . Dérijard ( Univ . Nice , France ) . Yeast two hybrid system . Using the pPC97 - GEFD1 construct as bait , we screened 3 · 10 5 clones of a human fibroblast cDNA library inserted into the pPC86 vector 27 , 44 . The specificity of the rescued clones and mapping experi - ments were determined by spotting 10 5 cells co - transformed with pPCS86 - filaminCter clone 2 ( fil2 , amino acids 2 , 354 – 2 , 647 ) and pPC97 - constructs on Leu – Trp – His – plates supplemented with 20mM 3 - amino triazole . Cell culture and transfection . HeLa cells were maintained as described 8 . Human filamin - deficient melanoma cell lines ( M2 ) , or sub - lines replete with full - length filamin ( A7 ) or with filamin A truncated by 112 amino acids at its C ter - minus ( C6 ) were maintained as described 21 , 29 . Four days after plating , M2 , A7 and C6 cells were trans - fected with lipofectamine reagent ( Life Technologies ) according the manufacturer’s instructions . HeLa cells plated on glass coverslips were transfected by the DEAE – dextran method . In vitro binding assays . Recombinant Trio constructs were excised from GST by factor Xa . ELISA experiments 45 were carried out by coating Trio domains at a concentration of 10nM . After saturation , coated plates were incubat - ed with serial dilutions of GST – fil2 for 2h at 37 (cid:176) C . An affinity - purified polyclonal anti - GST antibody was added at a concentration of 0 . 25mgml – 1 , after which alkaline - phosphatase - labelled anti - rabbit immunoglobulins were added . Assays were monitored at 405nm with p - nitrophenyl phosphate , and were conducted in triplicate . For affinity precipitation of human filamin by recombinant GST - fusion proteins , lysates from 10 8 HeLa cells were collected in NP40 lysis buffer ( 0 . 5 % NP40 , 150mM NaCl , 10mM Tris – HCl pH 7 . 5 , 1mM EDTA , 2mM NaVO 4 , 10mM Na 4 P 2 O 7 , 20mM NaF , 20mM b - glycerophosphate and protease inhibitors ) . Lysates were incubated for 1h with glutathione – sepharose 4B beads and the resulting supernatant was incubated for 3h at 4 (cid:176) C with 30 m g of different GST - recombinant proteins immobi - lized on glutathione – sepharose . Beads were washed in excess buffer , and samples were resolved by SDS – PAGE ( 5 % ) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes . The presence of filamin was then docu - mented by immunoblotting using a monoclonal antibody ( no . 1 , 680 , Chemicon , Temecula , CA ) . Immunofluorescence microscopy . Twenty - four hours after transfection , cells were serum - starved , fixed and permeabilized as described 10 . Cells were stained with appropriate primary and secondary antibodies as indicated . Melanoma cells were observed under a DMR Leica microscope using a · 63 planapochromat lens . Confocal analysis of HeLa cells transfected with Trio GEFD1 , DH1 or GEFD2 was carried out using a Bio - Rad 1024 CLSM system under a Nikon Optiphot II upright microscope according to the manufacturer’s instructions . All transfections were repeated at least 3 times and an average of 50 cells was examined each time . JNK assays . Cells were transfected with pSR a 3HA – JNK with or without pSR a HA – Trio GEFD1 and serum - starved 24 h after transfection ; JNK assays were carried out as described 9 . Samples were analysed by SDS – PAGE and transferred onto a nitrocellulose filter . The relative rate of phosphorylation was quan - tified on a Phosphorimager screen using ImageQuant software . In vitro GDP / GTP - exchange assays . Guanine nucleotide - release assays were carried out as described 8 using recombinant GST – Trio GEFD1 ( 28 . 5nM ) and GST - tagged Rho GTPases ( 200nM ) . To measure the effect of filamin A on the exchange activity of Trio GEFD1 , an equal molar amount ( 28 . 5nM ) or a ten - fold excess ( 285nM ) of GST – fil2 was pre - incubated with Trio GEFD1 for 20 min on ice before exchange assays were carried out on the appropriate GTPase .
