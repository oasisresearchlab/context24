These students were at a higher risk of respiratory infection from SARS - CoV - 2 due to challenges in tolerating mitigation measures ( e . g . masking ) . One in - school measure proposed to help mitigate the risk of SARS - CoV - 2 infection in schools is increased ventilation . Methods : We established a community - engaged research partnership between the University of Rochester and the Mary Cariola Center school for students with IDD . Ambient CO 2 levels were measured in 100 school rooms , and air changes per hour ( ACH ) were calculated . The number of SARS - CoV - 2 cases for each room was collected over 20 months . Results : 97 % of rooms had an estimated ACH ≤ 4 . 0 , with 7 % having CO 2 levels ≥ 2 , 000 ppm for up to 3 hours per school day . A statistically significant correlation was found between the time that a room had CO 2 levels ≥ 1 , 000 ppm and SARS - CoV - 2 PCR tests normalized to room August 28 , 2023 1 / 16 .

No statistically significant correlation was found for room ACH and per - room SARS - CoV - 2 cases . Rooms with ventilation systems using MERV - 13 filters had lower SARS - CoV - 2 - positive PCR counts . These findings led to ongoing efforts to upgrade the ventilation systems in this community - engaged research project . Conclusions : There was a statistically significant correlation between the total time of room CO 2 concentrations ≥ 1 , 000 and SARS - CoV - 2 cases in an IDD school . Merv - 13 filters appear to decrease the incidence of SARS - CoV - 2 infection . This research partnership identified areas for improving in - school ventilation . Introduction 1 A variety of mitigation measures have been employed to prevent SARS - CoV - 2 exposure 2 and infection , including immunologic ( e . g . vaccination , monoclonal antibodies ) , 3 antiviral ( e . g . paxlovid ) , and isolation methods ( e . g . masking , physical distancing , 4 stay - at - home policies ) . A key approach to environmental mitigation has been the use of 5 high volume ventilation of enclosed spaces ( i . e . adequate flow of fresh , uncontaminated 6 air ) , which has been shown to decrease the risk of infection from a variety of respiratory 7 pathogens [ 1 – 3 ] , and this effect has been widely presumed to include SARS - CoV - 2 . 8 Schools were an immediate focus in many areas with respect to mitigation measures for 9 SARS - CoV - 2 , including potentially costly recommendations for improving ventilation . 10 However , very little data are available assessing the actual impact of ventilation on 11 in - school transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 . 12 The SARS - CoV - 2 β - coronavirus is spread primarily via airborne droplets and 13 aerosols , which can remain circulating for up to three hours [ 4 ] . Ventilation is defined as 14 the process of supplying clean air to the indoor air of a dwelling by natural ( e . g . , open 15 windows if the outdoor air is sufficiently clean ) or mechanical means ( e . g . heating , 16 ventilation , and air conditioning ; HVAC ) often involving recirculating the air after 17 cleaning with a filter [ 5 ] . Increasing ventilation is one means of reducing exposure to 18 airborne viral pathogens , and increasing ventilation rates and upgrading inline HVAC 19 particle filters ( e . g . from MERV - 8 to MERV - 13 ) were widely recommended for public 20 venues including businesses , transportation , and schools [ 6 – 8 ] . For schools specifically , 21 improving ventilation as a risk reduction strategy was the subject of many 22 recommendations [ 8 , 8 – 11 ] . However , very little robust data are available assessing the 23 actual impact of improved ventilation on in - school transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 . One 24 study found 74 % lower aggregate rates of COVID - 19 in schools with mechanical versus 25 natural ventilation [ 12 ] . While there have been reports of outbreaks within 26 schools [ 13 , 14 ] , a number of epidemiological studies have concluded that students and 27 school staff had relatively low risk of SARS - CoV - 2 in - school transmission [ 15 – 17 ] and 28 schools were unlikely to be a major factor in the pandemic spread [ 18 ] . 29 Despite the larger number of epidemiological studies in public schools , we are not 30 aware of similar studies in schools for students with intellectual and developmental 31 disabilities ( IDD ) , who face greater risks [ 19 – 24 ] , and impacts from , infection . The 32 majority of students with IDD are served by IDD - specialized schools that provide 33 educational services , comprehensive clinical services , speech and psychological 34 interventions , nutritional needs , and physical care . Staff - to - student ratios are much 35 higher than in typical K - 12 schools , with more frequent , sustained and close physical 36 contact between staff and students [ 25 ] . Students with an IDD are at higher risk of 37 exposure to SARS - CoV - 2 [ 25 ] , severe infection , and mortality [ 24 ] . The IDD spectrum 38 covers many conditions ( e . g . autism spectrum disorder , genetic disorders ) , which are 39 associated with immune abnormalities that increase risk of SARS - CoV - 2 and poor 40 vaccine responses [ 19 – 24 ] . Many students with an IDD have difficulty with conventional 41 infection prevention measures such as masking and social distancing . This also puts 42 August 28 , 2023 2 / 16 .

Conversely , the impact on IDD students , and their caregivers , of 44 school closures , isolation and quarantine is heightened [ 26 ] . IDD students receive many 45 specialized services ( e . g . physical and speech therapy ) in school that are not readily 46 available at home . Thus , it is essential to identify interventions that are implementable 47 in the unique environment of IDD - specialized schools that retain students in school 48 while mitigating the risk of SARS - CoV - 2 infection . Increased ventilation has been 49 proposed as one such measure . 50 Time series measurements of CO 2 levels have been used as a frequent surrogate for 51 ventilation adequacy in schools [ 8 , 27 – 32 ] . As CO 2 is exhaled during respiration , it 52 accumulates in indoor spaces depending on the air exchange rates . The dynamic 53 balance between CO 2 production and ventilation with air having a lower CO 2 54 concentration determines the time - varying CO 2 concentration within a room . 55 Accordingly , time series measurements of room CO 2 concentrations can be used to 56 derive a surrogate marker for ventilation adequacy , typically measured as air changes 57 per hour ( ACH ) [ 27 ] . International guidelines recommend a minimum of 4 ACH for 58 school classrooms , and 8 - 15 ACH for auditoriums , athletic facilities , cafeterias and other 59 high - density or high - activity enclosed spaces [ 5 ] . Mismatched ventilation can result in 60 elevated indoor CO 2 levels that can affect learning and cognitive performance [ 33 ] , areas 61 of key focus in schools for students with an IDD . Unfortunately , many school buildings 62 have outdated HVAC systems , resulting in low or very low ACH [ 6 , 34 , 35 ] . 63 The National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) program ”Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics 64 for Underserved Populations ( RADx - UP ) ” was designed to study ways to support 65 vulnerable populations during the COVID - 19 pandemic . A major goal of the program 66 was to study strategies to keep vulnerable populations of students in school while 67 mitigating the risk of exposure and in - school spread of SARS - CoV - 2 among students 68 and staff . Primarily designed to study the utility of screening for infection with frequent 69 molecular testing , our RADx - UP project work has also focused on the effect of a variety 70 of measures on mitigating exposure and infection in an IDD - specialized school setting . 71 Here we report the results of an extensive study of ventilation across 3 buildings and 72 100 rooms in an IDD school for children and young adults ( ages 3 - 21 years ) during the 73 SARS - CoV - 2 pandemic . 74 Methods 75 Human subjects protection 76 This study was approved by the University of Rochester Medical Center Research 77 Subjects Review Board ( RSRB STUDY00005294 ) . Participants provided written 78 informed consent , and parents or guardians provided consent for minors . Recruitment 79 occurred April 1 , 2021 and through May 31 2023 . All subjects’ information and research 80 data were coded in compliance with the Department of Health and Human Services 81 Regulations for the Protection of Human Subjects ( 45 CFR 46 . 101 ( b ) ( 4 ) ) . 82 Room and building data 83 The school in this study is composed of 3 different buildings , each with a varying 84 number of classrooms , therapy and activity rooms , gyms , and a variety of offices . We 85 purposefully selected 100 school rooms , from a total of 267 , reflecting the different room 86 types in use across the 3 different buildings . Metadata collected included a unique room 87 identifier , building , square footage , ceiling height , total occupancy range , and room type 88 ( e . g . classroom , therapy , etc . ) . In addition , we obtained further data regarding the 89 August 28 , 2023 3 / 16 .

Individuals who tested positive within 30 days of a prior 98 positive PCR were considered single infections . 99 CO 2 measurements 100 In November 2022 , we measured ambient CO 2 levels , temperature , and humidity in 100 101 school rooms using ARANET4 sensors ( Aranet , Aurora Colorado ) with firmware 102 version 1 . 2 , with one sensor per classroom , twenty classrooms at a time . Monitors were 103 placed on the ceiling near the air return vents in the center of the room to ensure 104 mixing and avoid dead spaces within each room . In a small number of rooms , where 105 ceiling placement was not possible , monitors were placed on side walls near air return 106 vents . The indicator screens of the devices were covered so that classroom occupants 107 would not alter ventilation ( e . g . open windows or doors ) outside of their usual pattern . 108 Sensors were set to record ambient CO 2 , temperature , and humidity levels every 2 109 minutes continuously for 24 - 72 hours . Data were downloaded to an iPad ( Apple Inc . , 110 Cupertino CA ) using the Aranet manufacturer’s software as a . CSV file . Each record in 111 a . CSV file identified the sensor and time of each measurement . A separate . CSV file 112 identified the school room and sampling start and stop times . Individual . CSV files 113 were then processed with a custom R program that added the unique room ID number 114 to each record based on the sampling start and stop times and the unique sensor ID . 115 Duplicate records were removed . The final data set contained 150 , 286 individual 116 measurements ( Supplemental File S2 File ) . To assess intra - day variation , some rooms 117 had data continuously recorded for up to 120 hours , both during the normal weekly 118 school day , and over the weekend to assess temperature variations . 119 Air changes per hour estimation 120 To estimate air changes per hour ( ACH ) , CO 2 time series for each room ( Fig 1 ) were 121 first subjected to Gaussian blurring to scale σ = 10 and then local maxima identified 122 using Mathematica ( vers 13 . 1 ; FindPeaks ; Wolfram Research ) . Local minima were 123 similarly identified by analyzing the negative time series , resulting in pairs of 124 ( c maxi , c mini ) , which were then filtered to exclude pairs with small declines in CO 2 levels 125 where c maxi − c mini < 120 ( 2 rooms ) [ 27 , 36 ] . This resulted in 98 rooms with 126 measurements adequate for estimating ACH . We then fitted an exponential decay 127 curve [ 27 ] of the form : 128 c t = ( c maxi − c R ) e − αt + c R ( 1 ) to each time series segment between successive ( c maxi , c mini ) pairs , where i = number of 129 segments identified for an individual room , α is air exchanges per hour , and t is the 130 time from c maxi to c mini . Fitting was performed using the NonlinearModelFit function in 131 Mathematica with the Levenberg - Marquardt algorithm option ( Fig 1 ) . The room 132 airflow needed to achieve 4 air changes per hour was estimated using the volume of the 133 room ( cubic feet ) divided by 4 . 134 August 28 , 2023 4 / 16 .

Estimation of air changes per hour using ambient CO 2 levels . Example of CO 2 time series measurement , peak identification and fitting . A : CO 2 levels versus time in curve with Gaussian smoothing window of 10 , and peak ( red triangle ) and valley ( blue triangle ) identification . Segments with a long tail were truncated at the point where subsequent readings were only 2 % lower than the mean of the previous 10 readings . B . Eq 1 was fitted to each set of interval data using NonlinearModelFit function in Mathematica , and the Levenberg - Marquardt algorithm option . In those rooms with multiple ( peak , valley ) segments , the final room ACH value was estimated by averaging the estimates from all segments . Statistical Analysis 135 The incidence of positive PCR tests in each room over 12 months was normalized to 136 mean room occupancy from 1 month worth of attendance and occupancy data during a 137 fall semester of the school year in 2022 during the COVID - 19 pandemic . Correlation 138 between occupancy normalized counts of positive SARS - CoV - 2 tests and air changes per 139 hour ( ACH ) or exposure time to CO 2 ≥ 1 , 000 ppm were calculated using the 140 non - parametric Spearman’s rank correlation test , with the explained variance reported 141 as the Spearman’s ρ statistic . 142 Data Availability 143 Room data is available in Supplemental File S1 File , and the complete CO 2 144 measurements used in the analysis can be found in Supplemental File S2 File . 145 Results 146 Room characteristics 147 We sampled 100 rooms spread across three buildings . Two buildings had single stage 148 HVAC systems , which supplied ventilation only when triggered by the need for heating 149 during the sampling period ( November ) , while the third building had a two stage HVAC 150 system . Set - points for heating were set at 70 ◦ F from 6 AM - 6 PM , and 65 ◦ F outside 151 those hours . Outside temperatures during the measurement periods were all ≤ 65 ◦ F . For 152 all HVAC systems , air provided to rooms was 20 % outside and 80 % recirculated air . 153 One building had HVAC systems with inline MERV - 13 filters installed to mitigate 154 SARS - CoV - 2 transmission from recirculating air . The HVAC systems in two other 155 buildings had MERV - 11 filters as the blowers were not able to overcome the higher filter 156 resistance from MERV - 13 filters . The distribution of maximum room occupancy is 157 shown in Figure 2A . Room dimensions were measured , with mean room area 752 ± 492 158 ft 2 , and mean ceiling heights 8 . 6 ± 2 . 0 ft . As expected , peak room occupancy varied 159 linearly with room volume ( Fig . 2B ) . Windows remained closed in all classrooms during 160 the measurements . 161 Fig 2 . Capacity and volume of study rooms A . Distribution of maximum room occupancy in persons for the 100 rooms in the study . B . Room occupancy versus volume in ft 3 . Most rooms had ceiling heights of 9 - 10 feet , and the relationship between room volume and area is close to linear . Larger rooms had higher occupancy levels . August 28 , 2023 5 / 16 .

We then examined if peak CO 2 levels in 166 each room could be correlated with room volume ( Fig 3B ) , air changes per hour 167 calculated from each peak - trough pair ( Fig 3C ) , or maximum room occupancy ( Fig 3D ) . 168 No obvious correlations were present , likely due to the variation in ventilation systems 169 and room types among the 3 buildings . 170 Fig 3 .

Color coding indicates CO 2 concentration stratification by concentration bands commonly used by the American Society of Heating , Refrigerating and Cooling Engineers ( ASHRAE ) ( green , < 1 , 000 ppm ; yellow 1 , 000 - 2 , 000 ppm ; red , geq 2 , 000 ppm ) .

Room CO 2 concentrations 171 CO 2 levels ≥ 2500 ppm have been shown to decrease cognitive task performance in 172 neurotypical adults on standard test instruments [ 37 , 38 ] . We were therefore interested 173 in the amount of time each room’s CO 2 concentrations were within four different ranges 174 of CO 2 during an 8 hour school day ( 7AM - 3PM ) . Several patterns were evident ( Fig 4 . 175 Rooms in Group 1 ( n = 18 ) remained within the recommended values of CO 2 ( ≤ 1000 176 ppm ) [ 5 ] throughout the entire period . In contrast rooms in Group 2 ( n = 74 ) had CO 2 177 levels of 1001 - 2000 ppm , which have been shown to cause drowsiness and modest 178 decreases in performance of cognitive tasks in neurotypical adults [ 37 , 38 ] and 179 children [ 39 – 42 ] . Of note , occupants of rooms in Group 3 ( n = 6 ; 2001 - 3000 ppm ) and 180 Group 4 ( n = 2 ; ≥ 3000 ppm ) had approximately 1 - 6 hours at moderately high CO 2 181 levels , although still below the OSHA occupational limits of ≤ 5000 ppm . We confirmed 182 the elevated CO 2 levels in Group 3 and 4 rooms with 3 more full day time series 183 measurements . 184 Fig 4 . CO 2 level exposure The distribution of CO 2 exposure during an 8 hour school day . Stacked plots indicate the amount of time spent at each CO 2 level during the school day . Horizontal grid lines indicate quartiles . Each bar represents a room , with labels coded by building . Rooms are labeled by function : classroom , therapy , treatment , activity , gym , office , kitchen , break , copy , music , and technology . We also investigated whether the maximum CO 2 concentrations observed in each 185 room correlated with functional room type and building . Several different functional 186 room types were present among the 3 buildings : classroom , therapy , treatment , activity , 187 gym , office , kitchen , break , copy , music , and technology . Classrooms generally are 188 occupied during the day by 7 - 8 students , 1 teacher , and 2 - 4 aids , with activity levels 189 that produce moderate amounts of CO 2 . In contrast , music , activity , and gym rooms all 190 have activities that may generate larger emissions of CO 2 . Each building also has a 191 different type and vintage of HVAC system , with potential variation in ventilation . To 192 assess the distribution of peak CO 2 values , we sorted rooms by type and building , as 193 August 28 , 2023 6 / 16 .

Note that building B had the widest distribution of maximum measured 194 CO 2 values , and these were found in classrooms . While a number of the measured CO 2 195 concentrations were above the ASHRAE guidelines for classrooms for varying periods of 196 time [ 5 ] , none exceeded OSHA’s exposure limits [ 43 ] . 197 Fig 5 . Peak CO 2 levels by room functional type and building Each plot displays a density distribution , along with individual measurements , for the room types indicated . Horizontal grid lines indicate ranges of CO 2 which are acceptable ( green ) , moderately elevated ( yellow ) , and high ( red ) . Distributions for room types are further categorized by building . Temperature versus CO 2 relationship 198 The heating HVAC systems for each of the 3 buildings had zone heating and cooling . 199 Two buildings were described as single stage , with mechanical room ventilation 200 occurring only when the room needed to be heated or cooled , while one was described 201 as dual stage , with both a baseline level of ventilation and then increased airflow when 202 heating or cooling was required . CO 2 values are a function of both ongoing production 203 and ventilation . We hypothesized that room CO 2 measurements would decrease during 204 periods when the HVAC system was activated during room occupancy . Fig 6 shows 205 superimposed plots of CO 2 levels and temperature readings over time in a 206 representative sample of 9 out of 100 rooms . Note the oscillations in temperature as the 207 heating system engages ( e . g . Figure 6A , E , F , I ) in some rooms . Of note , Fig 6 panels 208 C , E , F and I all show instances where the temperatures increased rapidly , indicating 209 active mechanical heating and ventilation , with a corresponding decline in room CO 2 210 levels . These findings suggest that , at ambient temperatures above ( in winter ) or below 211 ( in summer ) the thermostat set point , HVAC cycling coupled to temperature regulation 212 may have decreased CO 2 clearance , since the blowers circulate air at higher flow rates 213 only when temperatures fell outside of the thermostat set point . 214 Fig 6 . CO 2 levels and room temperature Plots of CO 2 levels ( left axis ) and temperature ( right axis ) showing representative room patterns . ( A - C ) show rooms that had CO 2 levels ≥ 2000 ppm , ( D - F ) had CO 2 peak levels 1000 - 2000 ppm , and ( G - I ) had CO 2 ≤ 1000 from 7AM - 7PM . CO 2 are coded by ≤ 1 , 000 ppm ( green ) , 1 , 000 - 2 , 000 ppm ( yellow ) , and > 2 , 000 ppm ( red ) . Temperature is represented by the blue line . Air changes per hour estimates 215 Using the CO 2 level profiles for each room , we derived air changes per hour ( ACH ) by 216 fitting an exponential decay model to the time series segments where ∆CO 2 ≥ 120 ppm 217 between peak and trough in a decay segment ( Figure S1 Fig ) . The distribution of ACH 218 values is shown in Fig 7A , stratified by very low ( red ; ACH ≤ 1 . 0 ) , low ( yellow ; ACH 219 1 . 0 - 2 . 0 ) , and moderately acceptable ACH ≥ 2 . 0 ) . All were less than the recommended 220 ACH level of ≥ 4 . 0 [ 5 ] . Fig 7B demonstrates clearance of a 1200 ppm CO 2 load at the 221 estimated ACH for each room . Clearance times of 4 - 9 hours were consistent with 222 measured , overnight , CO 2 level declines . Finally , we compared the measured ACH 223 values for each room with the minimum ACH recommended based on maximal room 224 occupancy and measured room area and volume ( Fig 7C . The estimate of recommended 225 ACH based on ASHRAE 62 . 1 Table 6 - 1 , Classrooms ( ages 5 to 8 ) require an air flow 10 226 August 28 , 2023 7 / 16 .

The air flow was divided by 227 the room volume to obtain recommended ACH . This calculation may underestimate 228 required air flow , and thus recommended ACH , as it does not account for re - mixing of 229 outside ( i . e . fresh ) air ( 20 % ) and recirculated air ( 80 % ) used by the HVAC systems . 230 Fig 7 . Estimates of air changes per hour ( ACH ) ( A ) Distribution of estimated ACH . Only four rooms had an estimated ACH ≥ 2 . 0 . The recommended ACH for schools is ≥ 4 . 0 exchanges of fresh air per hour [ 5 , 9 ] . ( B ) Each ACH measure was used to model the decrease in CO 2 levels over time from a starting concentration of 1200 ppm CO 2 ( gray lines ) . Colored reference lines show expected CO 2 clearance with 0 . 1 , 0 . 5 , 1 . 0 , 2 . 0 , and 4 . 0 ACH . ( C ) Estimated room ACH plotted against recommended ACH for each room based maximum room occupancy as recommended for school rooms American Society of Heating , Refrigerating and Air - Conditioning Engineers ( ASHRAE ) standard 61 . 1 calculated from room area and occupancy [ 5 ] . Dashed line is where ACH measured = ACH recommended . Incidence of SARS - CoV - 2 - positive PCR tests 231 We next sought to determine if rooms with lower ACH had higher numbers of 232 SARS - CoV - 2 infections ( Fig . 8 ) , and whether MERV - 13 filters altered this result . 233 During the COVID - 19 pandemic , the use of high efficiency inline particle filters ( e . g . 234 MERV - 13 ) were recommended to improve filtration of SARS - CoV - 2 within HVAC 235 systems [ 2 , 8 – 10 ] . Higher filter efficiency , however , often results in lower ventilation rates 236 and greater strain on the HVAC mechanical blowers such that older HVAC systems may 237 not accommodate MERV - 13 filters . In this school , two building HVAC systems could 238 not provide the higher mechanical load required to circulate air through MERV - 13 239 filters , and continued to use MERV - 11 filters . We first gathered data for a 1 - year period 240 for positive SARS - CoV - 2 PCR test counts per classroom for those rooms that had 241 measurements of CO 2 levels , estimates of ACH , and MERV filter data . Positive PCR 242 tests were normalized to mean classroom occupancy . A comparison of rooms with 243 MERV - 11 filters demonstrates that they have a higher occupancy normalized positive 244 PCR tests per room compared to rooms with MERV - 13 filters ( Fig . 8A ) . Next , total 245 hours of CO 2 levels ≥ 1 , 000 ppm were tabulated for each room . A significant correlation 246 was found between hours of classroom CO 2 levels ≥ 1 , 000 ppm and the incidence of 247 SARS - CoV - 2 infection ( Spearman rank correlation ; p = 0 . 01937 , ρ = 0 . 2864 ) . Lastly , no 248 statistically significant correlation was found between estimated ACH and the incidence 249 of positive PCR tests normalized to mean classroom occupancy . 250 Fig 8 .

Our finding that less than 20 % of staff 253 and students had PCR - confirmed SARS - CoV - 2 infections is in agreement with other 254 school studies . Investigators in Norway [ 17 ] , Germany [ 44 ] , Italy [ 13 ] , United 255 States [ 45 – 47 ] and Ireland [ 16 ] found minimal or no evidence for in - school SARS - CoV - 2 256 transmission . Although there have been reports of small secondary infection 257 clusters [ 14 , 48 ] , larger studies have concluded that , overall , schools were unlikely to be a 258 major factor in the pandemic spread [ 18 ] . Although one retrospective cohort study in 259 Italy found that schools with mechanical ventilation had a 78 % lower incidence of 260 SARS - CoV - 2 cases , their findings may have limited applicability in geographic regions 261 where seasonal heating and cooling is necessary . Additionally , the conditions in IDD 262 schools are likely somewhat different than public schools reported in the above 263 publications . In the school studied in this work , only 30 % of the students were able to 264 tolerate masking , while all of the professional staff was masked . Thus , further study of 265 the combined effects of mitigation measures is needed . 266 Using CO 2 levels to estimate ACH , we found that the school ventilation systems did 267 not achieve ACH ≥ 4 , which is consistent with other reports [ 49 – 52 ] . However , the use 268 of CO 2 measurements to derive ACH comes with several important caveats [ 53 ] . To fit 269 exponential decay models to CO 2 concentrations , a sufficient decay time is needed after 270 CO 2 loading [ 27 , 54 ] . In this study , the CO 2 concentration decay phases occurred at the 271 end of the school day and overnight . However , the HVAC systems had slightly different 272 temperature set - points at night , which may have led to different ventilation rates , 273 underestimating daytime ACH [ 27 ] . In addition , the HVAC systems were set primarily 274 to maintain temperature , and thus higher CO 2 concentrations may have been due to 275 lower air circulation when the heat generated by room occupancy decreased the need for 276 higher rates of heated air circulation [ 27 ] . Ventilation rates can also vary in both 277 naturally - and mechanically - ventilated buildings , depending the indoor - outdoor 278 temperature difference , wind speed , heating and cooling load , building envelope leakage , 279 and other factors that may change over time [ 27 , 54 ] . Our measurements were performed 280 in the winter season ( November ) over 3 contiguous days , when heating was necessary 281 due to outside temperatures , which is relevant to both HVAC use and the respiratory 282 virus season in the northern hemisphere . These factors suggest that use of CO 2 level 283 ranges normalized to occupancy , with the above caveats , may be a practical method to 284 estimate ventilation adequacy in schools than CO 2 derived ACH measures . 285 Many have suggested that CO 2 monitoring could be used as a surrogate for adequate 286 ventilation [ 27 , 54 – 58 ] . While the primary goal of this work was to provide an estimate 287 of the correlation between SARS - CoV - 2 infections and room ventilation in an IDD 288 school , elevated CO 2 concentrations on their own may decrease cognitive task 289 performance [ 37 , 39 – 42 , 59 ] , concentration [ 60 ] , increase cough and rhinitis [ 61 ] , and 290 teacher’s reporting of health symptoms ( e . g . fatigue , headache ) [ 32 ] . Especially in 291 schools for IDD students , improving ventilation , and achieving recommended CO 2 levels 292 is likely to be important for school attendance [ 62 ] , learning , and cognitive task 293 performance [ 63 , 64 ] . Monitoring CO 2 levels would provide real - time data in classrooms , 294 and could be used to motivate interventions to improve ventilation and decrease CO 2 295 levels , from simple measures such as opening windows when possible to large - scale 296 upgrades of school HVAC systems . Such measures should , however , be correlated with 297 more rigorous measures of ventilation to account for numerous factors important for 298 interpretation of the results [ 53 ] . Finally , it is important to note that we did not 299 measure individual exposure over time to CO 2 concentrations , but rather concentrations 300 in rooms . Individuals generally move between classrooms , therapy rooms , the outdoors , 301 and other school areas , although less so during COVID . 302 August 28 , 2023 9 / 16 .

Circulating air 305 through a higher resistance particulate filter may not be possible for many older HVAC 306 systems , requiring an expensive upgrade . In addition , filters may decrease ventilation 307 rates , raising ambient CO 2 , particulate , and volatile organic compound concentrations . 308 Increasing the percentage of outdoor air brought in creates a trade - off between 309 improved ventilation and the need to heat , cool , and condition the humidity of the 310 incoming fresh air , increasing energy costs [ 37 , 65 ] . Similarly , for IDD schools , measures 311 such as opening windows create another trade off between improved ventilation and 312 student safety . Given the vintage of most public school buildings and HVAC systems , as 313 well as the budgets available for upgrades and remediation measures , this issue may 314 benefit from more public funding and policy discussions . 315 One goal of community engaged research partnerships is to have direct impact on 316 improving outcomes highly valued by the community . The comprehensive sampling in 317 100 rooms across 3 buildings revealed a wide variation in ventilation rates , as well as 318 number of hours exposed to CO 2 levels greater than 1 , 000 ppm . Only 8 rooms had 319 levels of CO 2 ≥ 2 , 000 ppm for more than 30 - 130 minutes over the course of a school day , 320 and of those 7 of 8 rooms were in the same building . These findings were subsequently 321 validated by an independent HVAC contractor engaged by the school . Of note , the 322 rooms with ventilation served by HVAC systems with MERV - 13 filters had lower rates 323 of PCR test positives for SARS - CoV - 2 . Overall , these results have sparked discussion 324 about upgrade of the ventilation systems . The school continues to seek state and federal 325 funding in an on - going effort to ensure and exceed the ventilation standards 326 recommended for schools . 327 Conclusions 328 There was a statistically significant correlation between rooms with CO 2 levels ≥ 1 , 000 329 ppm and SARS - CoV - 2 cases in an IDD school . Rooms served by HVAC systems with 330 in - line MERV - 13 filters had a lower incidence of SARS - CoV - 2 - positive PCR tests . This 331 research partnership identified areas for improving in - school ventilation and the use of 332 in - line , high efficiency air filtration . 333 Supporting information 334 S1 Fig .
