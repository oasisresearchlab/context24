Abstract The Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport ( ESCRT ) - III mediates membrane fission in fundamental cellular processes , including cytokinesis . ESCRT - III is thought to form persistent filaments that over time increase their curvature to constrict membranes . Unexpectedly , we found that ESCRT - III at the midbody of human cells rapidly turns over subunits with cytoplasmic pools while gradually forming larger assemblies . ESCRT - III turnover depended on the ATPase VPS4 , which accumulated at the midbody simultaneously with ESCRT - III subunits , and was required for assembly of functional ESCRT - III structures . In vitro , the Vps2 / Vps24 subunits of ESCRT - III formed side - by - side filaments with Snf7 and inhibited further polymerization , but the growth inhibition was alleviated by the addition of Vps4 and ATP .

Continuous ESCRT - III remodeling by subunit turnover might facilitate shape adaptions to variable membrane geometries , with broad implications for diverse cellular processes . Introduction The Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport - III ( ESCRT - III ) promotes membrane fission from the inner side of membrane necks in various cellular processes1 , including the biogenesis of multivesicular bodies2 , cytokinetic abscission3 – 7 , nuclear envelope sealing8 – 11 , plasma membrane repair12 , HIV budding13 , 14 , and exosome or microvesicle shedding15 – 17 . ESCRT - III forms polymers that are thought to constrict membrane necks until they split18 – 25 , but the mechanism underlying constriction is unknown . ESCRT - III is evolutionary conserved from humans to archaea , and is composed of four structurally related core subunits with distinct functions18 – 27 . Budding yeast Vps20 ( human homolog is CHMP6 ) functions as a nucleation factor , Snf7 ( human homolog CHMP4 has three isoforms , A - C ) serves as a main polymer subunit , Vps24 ( CHMP3 in humans ) and Vps2 ( CHMP2A and B isoforms in humans ) inhibit Snf7 polymerization28 – 32 and recruit the ATPase Vps4 , which is thought to predominantly disassemble ESCRT - III polymers30 , 31 , 33 – 38 . How different ESCRT - III components coordinately assemble and remodel polymer structures has remained unclear . Purified ESCRT - III subunits polymerize into filaments that form spirals on flat membranes or helices on membrane tubes36 , 39 – 45 . ESCRT - III also forms filament spirals and helices in intact cells44 , 46 , 47 , and it is required for the assembly of large filament helices that constrict the intercellular bridge during cytokinetic abscission4 . Prevailing models propose that ESCRT - III mediates membrane fission by sequential assembly of distinct subunits18 – 23 , 25 , whereby late - binding Vps2 / Vps24 ( CHMP2 / CHMP3 ) subunits might form a rigid dome - shaped scaffold to guide attached membranes towards the fission site36 or induce changes in the curvature of pre - assembled Snf7 filament spirals to promote membrane neck constriction41 . These models rely on the sequential addition of distinct subunits and the persistence of ESCRT - III polymers , yet this has not been directly observed under physiological conditions . We hence set out to systematically quantify the assembly kinetics , dynamics , and structure of ESCRT polymers in live human cells and in an in vitro reconstitution system . Results ESCRT - III assemblies continuously turn over their subunits with the cytoplasm To investigate the dynamics of ESCRT - III polymers at the abscission site , we generated stable HeLa cell lines expressing fluorescently tagged subunits . We found that CHMP4B tagged with GFP via a long flexible linker ( Localization and Affinity Purification tag , LAP ) and expressed close to endogenous levels4 did not perturb abscission ( Fig . 1a ) . To probe the functionality of LAP - tagged CHMP4B , we depleted endogenous CHMP4B in wild - type HeLa cells or in HeLa cells stably expressing siRNA - resistant mouse CHMP4B - LAP Mierzwa et al .

E u r op e P M C F und e r s A u t ho r M a nu s c r i p t s E u r op e P M C F und e r s A u t ho r M a nu s c r i p t s ( Supplementary Fig . 1a ) . Cytokinetic abscission was substantially perturbed upon depletion of endogenous CHMP4B in wild - type HeLa cells , but was not affected in mouse - CHMP4B - LAP - expressing HeLa cells ( Fig . 1a ) , validating the functionality of CHMP4B - LAP . We next investigated the dynamics of midbody - localized ESCRT - III by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) experiments . Unexpectedly , we found that CHMP4B - LAP rapidly re - accumulated at the midbody following photobleaching ( Fig . 1b , c and Supplementary Video 1 ) . A single exponential function constrained to initial fluorescence values did not fit the FRAP kinetics ( Fig . 1c ) , indicating the presence of two populations of CHMP4B - LAP with distinct residence times at the midbody . We determined the residence times for the two midbody - localized fractions by a double - exponential fit ( Fig . 1b , h , i ) . A highly mobile fraction of 64 ± 6 % ( mean ± SEM , as in the rest of the paper , if not otherwise noted ) of CHMP4B - LAP had a residence time of 19 . 5 ± 2 . 7 s , whereas a stably - bound fraction of 36 ± 2 % had a residence time of 716 . 0 ± 91 . 3 s . Modeling the stably - bound fraction as completely immobile also yielded a good approximation ( Supplementary Fig . 1b , c ) . Importantly , both methods of model fitting yielded consistent values for the fraction and residence time of the highly mobile pool ( Supplementary Fig . 1d ) . Thus , the majority of CHMP4B - LAP molecules at the midbody continuously turns over with a cytoplasmic pool – at a rate up to two orders of magnitude faster than the macroscopic accumulation of ESCRT - III at the midbody4 , 5 . ESCRT - III initially localizes within two cortical regions adjacent to the midbody , which later constrict to split the plasma membrane4 , 5 . Photobleaching of CHMP4B - LAP prior to or during constriction stages revealed similar recovery kinetics ( Fig . 1b , d , e , and Supplementary Video 1 ) , indicating that midbody - localized ESCRT - III dynamically turns over subunits with cytoplasmic pools during its macroscopic accumulation and constriction . We next investigated the localization and dynamics of other ESCRT - III subunits . We tagged human CHMP2B , CHMP3 and CHMP4B with the same design used for tagging mouse CHMP4B . All three LAP - tagged ESCRT - III subunits localized to the midbody ( Fig . 2f , g , and Supplementary Video 2 ) and did not perturb abscission ( Supplementary Fig . 2a - d ) . CHMP2B , CHMP3 , and CHMP4B subunits accumulated at the midbody with indistinguishable kinetics ( Fig . 2f , g , and Supplementary Video 2 ) . Hence , ESCRT - III assembles at the midbody with a fairly constant proportion of different core subunits during the progression of abscission . We next probed the dynamics of human CHMP2B , CHMP3 , and CHMP4B at the midbody . FRAP experiments showed that all three subunits had highly mobile fractions with residence times similar to mouse CHMP4B ( Fig . 1h , i , and Supplementary Fig . 2g - i ) . We noticed somewhat variable kinetics at late stages of FRAP recovery , which resulted in inaccurate fitting of single exponential functions ( Supplementary Fig . 2e - g ) . Given the technical difficulty to accurately measure long residence times , the relevance of the observed variations remains unclear . Importantly , however , all FRAP experiments consistently show that highly mobile fractions of CHMP2B , CHMP3 , and CHMP4B dynamically turn over with similar residence times . Overall , our experiments show that ESCRT - III forms highly dynamic assemblies at the midbody . Mierzwa et al . Page 3 Nat Cell Biol . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2017 December 12 . E u r op e P M C F und e r s A u t ho r M a nu s c r i p t s E u r op e P M C F und e r s A u t ho r M a nu s c r i p t s Dynamic subunit turnover in ESCRT - III assemblies depends on VPS4 We wondered if VPS4 could be responsible for ESCRT - III turnover , as it is the only known nucleotide hydrolase in the ESCRT - III pathway30 , 33 . VPS4 was previously detected at the midbody only during late stages of abscission5 , which would be inconsistent with its contribution to the high ESCRT - III turnover observed during early stages . However , previous measurements of VPS4 accumulation were based on overexpression from a viral promoter5 , which could limit its detection at the midbody owing to high cytoplasmic background . We thus re - examined VPS4 accumulation in cells stably expressing LAP - tagged murine VPS4B from its endogenous promoter ( Supplementary Fig . 3a ) . In these cells , VPS4B - LAP indeed accumulated at the midbody simultaneously with CHMP4B - LAP ( Fig . 2a , b , and Supplementary Video 3 ) . Thus , VPS4 is present at early stages and could contribute to ESCRT - III dynamics throughout the entire abscission process . To investigate the role of VPS4 in ESCRT - III dynamics , we depleted both isoforms VPS4A and VPS4B in CHMP4B - LAP - expressing cells using RNAi . Depletion of endogenous VPS4A / B to undetectable levels at 48 h after siRNA transfection ( Supplementary Fig . 3b ) substantially reduced the amount of CHMP4B - LAP at the midbody ( Fig . 2c , and Supplementary Fig . 3c ) . FRAP experiments revealed that under this condition , CHMP4B - LAP turnover at the midbody was almost completely suppressed ( Fig . 2e , f ) . We considered that this phenotype may arise from the strong reduction of the cytoplasmic CHMP4B concentration , owing to the accumulation of ESCRT - III at endosomes upon complete VPS4 depletion47 , 48 ( Fig . 3c , d ) . However , partial depletion of VPS4A / B at 20 h after siRNA transfection also reduced the fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( Fig . 2e , f ) without altering the cytoplasmic CHMP4B - LAP concentration ( Fig . 2c , d ) . The cytoplasmic levels of CHMP2B - LAP or CHMP3 - LAP were also not affected upon partial VPS4A / B depletion ( Supplementary Fig . 3d , e ) . Furthermore , microinjection of recombinant human CHMP4B protein into telophase cells resulted in rapid accumulation at the midbody in control cells , but a much slower rate in VPS4A / B - depleted cells ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . Together , these experiments show that VPS4 is required for dynamic turnover of ESCRT - III at the midbody . VPS4 is required for constriction of the intercellular bridge We next studied how VPS4 contributes to abscission . RNAi depletion of VPS4A / B delayed abscission and frequently caused cleavage furrow regression ( Fig . 3a , b ) . These abscission failures did not occur in cells stably expressing murine VPS4B - LAP , which is resistant to siRNA targeting human VPS4A / B ( Fig . 3b , and Supplementary Fig . 3a ) , validating that this phenotype is caused by on - target depletion . To gain further insight into the underlying defect , we investigated the ultrastructure of intercellular bridges in cryo - immobilized telophase cells . Most of the control cells contained constriction zones adjacent to the midbody with regularly spaced 17 nm diameter filaments and compressed bundles of microtubules ( Fig . 3c ; 4 out of 7 cells ) , as previously observed4 . After partial VPS4A / B depletion at 26 h after siRNA transfection , only a small fraction of cells had 17 nm filaments ( Fig . 3d ; 4 out of 27 cells ) , and narrow constriction zones were never observed . Together , these data indicate that VPS4 is required for the formation and constriction of a functional ESCRT - III apparatus at intercellular bridges . Mierzwa et al . Page 4 Nat Cell Biol .

As purified human ESCRT - III proteins are difficult to spontaneously polymerize on flat membranes under physiological concentrations49 , we considered to use the evolutionarily conserved budding yeast proteins . We first tested whether budding yeast Snf7 ( homolog of human CHMP4 ) can in principle recapitulate the cellular dynamics observed for human proteins and therefore expressed a LAP - tagged version in HeLa cells . Budding yeast Snf7 - LAP specifically localized to the midbody during abscission and rapidly recovered after photobleaching similar to human and mouse CHMP4B - LAP ( Supplementary Fig . 5a - d ) , validating the use of yeast proteins for in vitro analysis of ESCRT - III dynamics . Previous work showed that Snf7 spontaneously polymerizes on membrane covered areas of coverslips to form large patches composed of densely packed filament spirals43 . We studied patch growth kinetics only in central areas of membrane - covered regions , as patches stop growth at the edge of membrane - covered regions ( Supplementary Fig . 5e - g ) . We first investigated how Vps24 ( homolog of human CHMP3 ) and Vps2 ( CHMP2 ) affected the kinetics of Snf7 polymerization . We therefore incubated supported lipid bilayers with fluorescently labeled Snf7 until patches formed and then simultaneously added Vps2 and Vps24 ( Fig . 4a , b , and Supplementary Video 4 ; 22 min ) . Following rapid binding , Vps2 and Vps24 suppressed patch growth and strongly reduced further accumulation of Snf7 in patches ( Fig . 4c , d , and Supplementary Fig . 6a - c ) . Sequential injection of Vps2 and Vps24 into the fluid chamber further showed that these subunits depend on each other in their Snf7 growth - inhibitory function ( Fig . 4e , Supplementary Fig . 6d , e , and Supplementary Videos 5 and 6 ) . Thus , prolonged phases of ESCRT - III assembly , as observed during cytokinetic abscission4 , 5 , are not recapitulated by mixed solutions of Snf7 , Vps2 , and Vps24 . The inhibition of Snf7 patch growth by Vps2 / Vps24 could be caused by lower rates of Snf7 subunit accumulation or by an increase of the Snf7 dissociation rate . To investigate this , we incubated supported lipid bilayers with fluorescently labeled Snf7 until patches formed and then washed out soluble Snf7 . We subsequently added fluorescently labeled Vps2 and Vps24 , which enriched at the edge of the patch , where newly growing Snf7 filament spirals localize43 ( Fig . 4f , g , and Supplementary Video 7 ) . Snf7 remained stably bound to patches throughout the entire imaging period , indicating that Snf7 polymers have extremely low intrinsic subunit dissociation rates irrespective of their association with Vps2 and Vps24 . The inhibition of Snf7 patch growth imposed by Vps2 and Vps24 is thus independent of Vps4 and caused by a reduced rate of Snf7 subunit incorporation . Vps2 and Vps24 form filament bundles with Snf7 We next investigated if growth inhibition by Vps2 and Vps24 could arise from an ultrastructural change in ESCRT - III polymers . Transmission electron microscopy showed that Snf7 alone polymerized on liposomes to form one - start spirals containing a single 4 . 5 nm wide filament , which occasionally paired between neighboring turns ( Fig . 5a , b ) , as previously observed43 . When Vps2 and Vps24 were added after Snf7 polymerization , filaments appeared double - stranded and neighboring spiral turns occasionally bundled to form quadruple strands with an approximate width of 15 nm ( Fig . 5c , d ) – close to the width Mierzwa et al .

Given the one - start single - stranded geometry of Snf7 spirals prior to addition of Vps2 / Vps24 , the paired filaments likely represent lateral copolymers of Vps2 / Vps24 along Snf7 . To further characterize the morphological changes of Snf7 filaments upon addition of Vps2 / 24 , we visualized ESCRT - III assemblies by high - speed atomic force microscopy ( HS - AFM ) ( Fig . 5g ) . Snf7 alone formed spirals with pronounced filaments , but subsequent addition of Vps2 / Vps24 induced a compact disc - like morphology ( Fig . 5g - i ) . This is consistent with a filament thickening and bundling limiting access of the AFM tip in between neighboring spiral turns . Together , these data suggest that Vps2 / Vps24 might reduce the rate of Snf7 polymerization through the formation of bundled filaments . Vps4 induces subunit turnover and net growth of ESCRT - III assemblies in vitro In cells , Vps2 and Vps24 are both present in the cytoplasm , raising the question of how ESCRT - III polymerization is sustained over prolonged periods . Our in vivo observations imply the possibility that Vps4 might leverage Vps2 / Vps24 - mediated growth inhibition by ESCRT - III turnover . To explore whether Vps4 promotes ESCRT - III turnover in vitro , we separately measured ESCRT - III subunit association and dissociation kinetics . We first determined the rate by which Vps4 disassembles Snf7 patches in the absence of Vps2 and Vps24 . We polymerized Snf7 on supported lipid membranes , washed out soluble Snf7 , and then added Vps4 and ATP . This did not cause detectable disassembly of Snf7 patches even at very high Vps4 concentrations ( Fig . 6a , b ) , indicating that Vps4 - mediated Snf7 depolymerization strictly depends on Vps2 / Vps24 , as shown before37 . We thus quantified the rate of Vps4 - mediated ESCRT - III patch disassembly in presence of Vps2 and Vps24 . We first polymerized Snf7 patches on supported lipid membranes , then removed the soluble pool of Snf7 , and subsequently added a mix of fluorescently labeled Vps2 and unlabeled Vps24 , Vps4 , and ATP . Vps2 first bound to Snf7 patches and subsequently partially disassembled together with Snf7 ( Fig . 6c , d , Supplementary Fig . 7a , b , and Supplementary Video 8 ) . Thus , Vps4 - mediated Snf7 depolymerization is fast enough to account for dynamic turnover of its homolog CHMP4B at the midbody in human cells . To characterize the Snf7 - disassembly process at the molecular level , we visualized morphological changes of individual ESCRT - III spirals by HS - AFM . We polymerized Snf7 patches on supported lipid bilayers , then added Vps2 and Vps24 , and subsequently washed out the soluble components . We then added Vps4 and ATP and acquired HS - AFM movies , which showed that ESCRT - III spirals reduced their diameter ( Fig . 6e , f , and Supplementary Video 9 ) . When omitting ATP from the reaction , Vps4 did not disassemble ESCRT - III spirals ( Fig . 6g , and Supplementary Video 10 ) , confirming that ESCRT - III disassembly is an energy - consuming process . Given that the ESCRT - III spirals did not depolymerize below a certain diameter , these data suggest that Vps4 mediates Snf7 filament disassembly predominantly from the outer regions of spirals , whereby inner spiral segments are refractory to disassembly . We next tested whether Vps4 can mediate Snf7 turnover in vitro . For this purpose , we used Snf7 subunits labeled with two distinct fluorophores . We first incubated supported lipid Mierzwa et al .

E u r op e P M C F und e r s A u t ho r M a nu s c r i p t s E u r op e P M C F und e r s A u t ho r M a nu s c r i p t s bilayers with AlexaFluor - 488 - labeled Snf7 until patches formed and then added Vps24 and Vps2 to inhibit further patch growth ( Fig . 7a - c , see 0 - 45 min , and Supplementary Video 11 ) . We then exchanged the soluble pool of Snf7 - AlexaFluor - 488 with Snf7 - Atto - 647N while maintaining Vps2 and Vps24 in the reaction . At this point , we also added Vps4 . Snf7 polymer patches maintained constant size and did not incorporate Atto - 647N - Snf7 , presumably because ATP was not yet present ( Fig . 7a - c , see 45 - 54 min ) . Indeed , subsequent ATP addition caused dissociation of AlexaFluor - 488 - Snf7 from patches , but also concomitant binding of Atto - 647N - Snf7 ( Fig . 7a - c , see 54 - 88 min ) . Thus , an ATP - dependent activity of Vps4 promotes not only disassembly of ESCRT - III but also the formation of new ESCRT - III polymers on membranes . Interestingly , Vps4 and ATP also restored the macroscopic growth of Snf7 patches despite the continued presence of Vps2 and Vps24 ( Fig . 7a , b , see 58 - 88 min , and Supplementary Video 11 ) . We thus tested if a solution containing Vps4 , ATP , and all three ESCRT - III subunits supports nucleation and growth of ESCRT - III polymers as observed in vivo . Strikingly , this combination resulted in efficient nucleation and growth of ESCRT - III patches , in contrast to a mix that lacked Vps4 ( Fig . 7d , e ) . Furthermore , the net ESCRT - III assembly rate increased with higher concentrations of Vps4 ( Supplementary Fig . 7c ) . Thus , Vps4 promotes net growth of ESCRT - III assemblies in presence of growth - inhibiting Vps2 and Vps24 subunits . Vps4 induces dynamic growth and shrinkage of ESCRT - III filament spirals To study Vps4 - mediated polymer remodeling at the molecular level , we visualized ESCRT - III spirals by HS - AFM . We assembled Snf7 spirals on supported lipid bilayers and then added Vps2 , Vps24 , Vps4 , and ATP . This induced a drastic reorganization of ESCRT - III polymers : preexisting spirals reduced their size , while many new spirals nucleated and grew in between the original spirals ( Fig . 8a , b , and Supplementary Video 12 ) . The innermost parts of ESCRT - III spirals appeared refractory to disassembly and thus might represent the stably - bound fraction of ESCRT - III observed by fluorescence microscopy . In contrast , pre - existing spirals remained unchanged in the absence of ATP ( Fig . 8c , and Fig . 6g ) . Thus , Vps4 induces a dynamic steady - state with both growing and shrinking ESCRT - III spirals when Snf7 , Vps2 , Vps24 are present in solution . Furthermore , while ESCRT - III spirals formed an immobile array in the absence of ATP , the addition of ATP induced substantial lateral mobility of individual ESCRT - III spirals relative to each other ( Fig . 8d - f , and Fig . 6g ) . Thus , in the presence of Vps4 and ATP , ESCRT - III forms highly dynamic polymer structures on membranes . Discussion Our study shows that membrane - bound ESCRT - III polymers rapidly turn over subunits with cytoplasmic pools while they assemble into larger structures . The dynamic subunit turnover is driven by Vps4 and is necessary to sustain efficient net growth of ESCRT - III assemblies in presence of inhibitory Vps2 and Vps24 subunits . Mierzwa et al .

E u r op e P M C F und e r s A u t ho r M a nu s c r i p t s E u r op e P M C F und e r s A u t ho r M a nu s c r i p t s Most previous models for ESCRT - III - mediated membrane fission imply sequential recruitment of different ESCRT - III subunits and Vps4 to establish distinct phases of polymer growth , reorganization / maturation , and disassembly5 , 14 , 18 – 21 , 23 – 25 , 28 , 30 , 31 . However , our study shows that different ESCRT - III subunits and VPS4 accumulate at the midbody with indistinguishable kinetics . This does not rule out sequential subunit binding at the single - filament level , but indicates that the distinct stages of ESCRT - III accumulation , constriction , and disassembly during abscission cannot be explained by a sequence of subunit binding . Our findings call for re - interpretation of the terminal phenotype resulting from Vps4 depletion – the accumulation of ESCRT - III polymers in endosomes ( termed class E compartment in yeast ) that has led to the model of Vps4 serving predominantly as a disassembly factor 26 , 28 , 33 , 50 . We show that Vps4 is important for efficient ESCRT - III assembly , yet we also note that residual slow ESCRT - III polymerization in the absence of Vps4 is sufficient to ultimately capture all cytoplasmic subunits in class E compartments – owing to the extremely low intrinsic subunit dissociation rates . At the molecular level , Vps4 might promote the net growth of ESCRT - III assemblies by constant turnover of Vps2 and Vps24 in side - by - side co - polymers along Snf7 filaments – to create growth - competent free Snf7 filament tips ( Fig . 8g ) . Furthermore , Vps4 might induce subunit turnover at the core of ESCRT - III filament bundles , in analogy to interaction of the Vps4 homolog Spastin with the lattice of microtubules51 ( Fig . 8g ) . In contrast to previous models5 , 52 , however , Vps4 does not cut an ESCRT - III helix during a single definite time point to induce tension release , but rather continuously remodels filaments . Within bundled filaments , such turnover does not necessarily lead to a complete breakage of larger structures . The innermost parts of ESCRT - III spirals appear refractory to disassembly even at high concentrations of Vps4 , suggesting that ESCRT - III interaction with Vps4 might depend on mechanical stress owing to low filament curvature or on filament polarity . Potential stochastic fluctuations in subunit turnover rates could then lead to dynamic growth and shrinkage of ESCRT - III spirals . Vps4 - induced subunit turnover in ESCRT - III assemblies might directly contribute to membrane constriction . Indeed , macroscopic shape changes of many other cellular polymer structures critically depend on dynamic subunit turnover within the constituent filaments , as for example mitotic spindles53 or actomyosin rings54 . In ESCRT - III assemblies , Vps4 - induced subunit turnover might facilitate sliding of adjacent helix turns , thereby promoting constriction of mechanically pre - stressed , low - curved filaments into more relaxed high - curvature states43 . The underlying bending forces could be generated by binding of Vps2 and Vps24 to Snf741 , or by shortening - induced increase of filament rigidity . By revealing dynamic subunit turnover in ESCRT - III assemblies , our study provides a framework for understanding how this highly conserved membrane fission machinery adapts to diverse membrane geometries .

Next , mCherry was exchanged with a LAP tag using KpnI and XbaI ( ThermoFisher Scientific ) , resulting in pTO _ LAP _ N - DEST , a Gateway destination vector for C - terminal LAP tags that allows FRT recombination and Tet - inducible expression . Expression vectors were generated by recombining pTO _ LAP _ N - DEST with Gateway entry clones containing cDNA of human ESCRT - III subunits in pDONR223 ( obtained from hORFeome Database ) or S . cerevisiae SNF7 ( amplified from genomic DNA and cloned into pDONR223 ) using Gateway LR Clonase II ( Invitrogen ) , to generate pTO _ CHMP2B _ LAP , pTO _ CHMP3 _ LAP , pTO _ CHMP4B _ LAP and pTO _ SNF7 _ LAP . Cell lines for inducible expression of ESCRT - III subunits were generated from HeLa Kyoto FRT _ H2B - mRED55 . To remove H2B - mRED , cells were grown without selection for H2B - mRED in medium containing 0 . 5 µg / mL puromycin ( Merck ) , 400 µg / mL zeocin ( Invitrogen ) , but no G418 . Cells were then FACS - sorted for the absence of red fluorescence , and single clones were isolated . Inducible ESCRT - III constructs were then integrated into the FRT site by co - transfection with pOG44 ( Invitrogen ) at a ratio of 1 : 10 , and selected in medium containing 300 μg / mL hygromycin B ( Roche ) and 0 . 5 μg / mL puromycin ( Merck ) . To generate a cell line expressing mmVPS4B - LAP , the bacterial artificial chromosome ( BAC ) RP24 - 139J22 was used to GFP - tag mouse VPS4B using BAC - TransGeneOmics56 , 57 . Homologous recombination yielded BAC DNA containing VPS4B - LAP , which was isolated and transfected into HeLa cells using Effectene ( Qiagen ) , and selected in medium containing 400 µg / mL G418 ( Invitrogen ) . All HeLa BAC - GFP cell lines were cultured in medium supplemented with 300 μg / mL G418 ( Invitrogen ) . No cell line used in this study is listed in the database of commonly misidentified cell lines that is maintained by ICLAC and NCBI Biosample . The HeLa Wildtype cell line ( ‘Kyoto’ strain ) was obtained from S . Narumiya ( Kyoto University , Japan ) and validated by a Multiplex human Cell line Authentication test ( MCA ) , 21 . 04 . 16 . All cell lines have been regularly tested for mycoplasma , and a contamination has never been detected . Cell culture , live - cell microscopy and image analysis HeLa cells were cultured at 37°C and 5 % CO 2 in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium ( DMEM , Invitrogen ) , supplemented with 10 % ( v / v ) Fetal Calf Serum ( FCS , Invitrogen ) and 1 % ( v / v ) penicillin - streptomycin ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . For live - cell imaging , cells were plated in LabTek II chambered coverslips ( ThermoFisher Scientific ) or glass bottom dishes ( µ - Dish 35 mm , high Glass Bottom , Ibidi ) in cell culture medium without riboflavin and phenol red to minimize background fluorescence58 . Microtubules were stained with 100 nM SiR - tubulin59 and 10 µM verapamil ( Sigma - Aldrich ; to inhibit efflux of SiR - tubulin from cells ) , at least 1 h before imaging . Protein expression in cell lines bearing hsCHMP2B - LAP , hsCHMP3 - LAP or hsCHMP4B - LAP was induced with 0 . 2 ng / mL doxycycline ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , titrated to match levels of mmCHMP4B - LAP from the BAC construct .

E u r op e P M C F und e r s A u t ho r M a nu s c r i p t s E u r op e P M C F und e r s A u t ho r M a nu s c r i p t s expression of yeast Snf7 - LAP , HeLa Kyoto FRT were transfected with pTO _ SNF7 _ LAP using X - tremeGENE 9 ( Roche ) 24 h prior to imaging , and induced with 0 . 05 ng / mL doxycycline ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . Cells were imaged on a Zeiss LSM780 confocal microscope controlled by ZEN 2011 and an autofocus macro ( AutofocusScreen ) kindly provided by Jan Ellenberg ( EMBL ) . Imaging was performed in a humidified atmosphere of 5 % CO 2 and 37°C in an incubation chamber ( EMBL ) . For analysis of accumulation kinetics , cells were imaged with a 63x 1 . 4 NA oil DIC Plan - Apochromat objective ( Zeiss ) . ESCRT - III levels at the midbody were quantified in single optical sections using Fiji60 . For normalization , the fluorescence signal prior to ESCRT - III accumulation was set to zero . Due to the variable duration of abscission , we chose the earliest time point for which we had data in all cells , which was at 48 min before abscission . Peak signals were normalized to the average midbody fluorescence from 12 min before to 6 min after abscission . Accumulation curves in VPS4A / B depletion experiments were normalized to 18 - 30 min after complete cleavage furrow ingression . For quantification of abscission timing , cells were imaged with a 40x 1 . 4 NA oil DIC Plan - Apochromat objective ( Zeiss ) . Abscission timing was measured as the duration from complete cleavage furrow ingression until the first disassembly of the midbody microtubules . For VPS4B rescue experiments , only cells expressing mmVPS4B - LAP were analyzed . FRAP experiments Midbodies were imaged using a 63x 1 . 4 NA oil DIC Plan - Apochromat objective ( Zeiss ) . Photobleaching was performed in circular regions with 2 iterations of 488 nm at 42 - fold higher laser intensity compared to that used for imaging . Fluorescence was measured in midbody regions followed by background subtraction . For normalization , acquisition photobleaching and ESCRT - III net accumulation during the recording interval was measured separately for early and late - stage midbodies . FRAP curves were then normalized to the mean of the pre - bleach fluorescence and to the first frame after photobleaching . For all different constructs , cells with expression levels similar to that of mmCHMP4B - LAP cells were used . To determine FRAP recovery kinetics , we fitted single exponential functions f ( t ) = 1 − e −kt , single exponential functions with a variable immobile fraction f ( t ) = A ( 1 − e −kt ) , or double exponential functions f ( t ) = A 1 ( 1 − e −k1t ) + ( 1 − A 1 ) ( 1 − e −k2t ) , using the Levenberg - Marquardt nonlinear least - squares algorithm ( minpack . lm package for R , version 3 . 0 . 2 ) . Convergence to minimal residuals was reached in ~ 76 % of the curves . Residence times were calculated from the dissociation rates as 1 / k 1 and 1 / k 2 . Because the slow dissociation rate k 2 was frequently fitted as 0 due to a completely stable fraction , we derived the slow residence times from the Taylor expansion to calculate the reciprocal mean from and standard deviation from , where µ is the mean and σ is the standard deviation . Since the long residence time could not be measured accurately Mierzwa et al . Page 10 Nat Cell Biol . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2017 December 12 . E u r op e P M C F und e r s A u t ho r M a nu s c r i p t s E u r op e P M C F und e r s A u t ho r M a nu s c r i p t s due to the relatively short duration of measurements , we constrained k 2 to the mean ± SD of mmCHMP4B - LAP in all experiments . For comparison of highly mobile fractions , we additionally constrained k 1 to the mean k 1 of mmCHMP4B - LAP , which corresponds to a residence time of 19 . 5 s . siRNA treatment Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX ( Invitrogen ) with non - targeting siRNA siControl ( ambion , sense strand : UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUtt ) , or siRNAs targeting CHMP4B ( Microsynth , sense strand : AGAAAGAAGAGGAGGACGAtt ) 4 , 61 , VPS4A ( Microsynth , sense strand : CCGAGAAGCUGAAGGAUUAtt ) 61 , or VPS4B ( Microsynth , sense strand : CCAAAGAAGCACUGAAAGAtt ) 61 , at a final concentration of 80 nM . Samples were analyzed at the indicated times after transfection . Generation and microinjection of CHMP4B To generate a CHMP4B bacterial expression plasmid containing an N - terminal 6xHis tag followed by a maltose binding protein ( MBP ) and a tobacco etch virus ( TEV ) protease cleavage site , human CHMP4B was cloned into pMBP - HIS2 - Snf7 ( Addgene # 21492 ) , by replacing Snf7 with PCR - amplified CHMP4B using BamHI and NotI . For production of recombinant protein , the plasmid was transformed into E . coli Rosetta cells and expressed for 3 h at 30°C after induction with 0 . 5 mM IPTG . Bacterial were lysed by sonication at 4°C in lysis buffer containing 20 mM Hepes pH8 , 100 mM NaCl , 1 % Triton X - 100 , and cOmplete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail ( Roche ) . CHMP4B was purified using affinity chromatography ( MBPTrap HP 5 mL column , GE Healthcare ) , washed with 20 mM Hepes pH8 , 250 mM NaCl , 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 , and eluted in 20 mM Hepes pH8 , 10 mM maltose , followed by removal of maltose using Zeba Spin Desalting Columns ( 7K MWCO 5 mL , ThermoFisher Scientific ) . After cleavage with TEV protease , the resulting His - MBP fragment was removed by incubation with Ni - NTA Agarose beads ( ThermoFisher Scientific ) for 1 h , followed by incubation with Dextrin Sepharose beads ( GE Healthcare ) for 1 h to remove remaining protein that was not cleaved by TEV protease . Purified CHMP4B was labeled with Atto - 565 - NHS ester ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , by incubation with two molar excess of reactive dye in the presence of 100 mM NaHCO 3 pH9 . Excess free dye was removed by dialysis against 20 mM Hepes pH8 at 4°C using a MWCO membrane of 12 - 14 kDa , and the sample was further purified using Zeba spin desalting columns ( ThermoFisher Scientific ) . The resulting labeling density was ~ 80 % . Protein aggregates were removed by ultracentrifugation at 100 , 000 g for 10 min at 4°C , and the protein stored at - 80°C after flash freezing . For microinjection into cells , CHMP4B was ultracentrifuged for 30 min at 80 , 000 g at 4°C and loaded into Femtotips ( Eppendorf ) . Microinjection was performed using InjectMan 4 micromanipulator ( Eppendorf ) and the FemtoJet 4i ( Eppendorf ) microinjection system , with an injection pressure of 100 hPa , an injection time of 0 . 2 - 0 . 5 s , and a maintenance pressure of 20 hPa . The microinjection system was mounted on the Zeiss LSM780 system described above , and cells were imaged with a 40x 1 . 4 NA oil DIC Plan - Apochromat objective ( Zeiss ) immediately prior and after injection .

E u r op e P M C F und e r s A u t ho r M a nu s c r i p t s E u r op e P M C F und e r s A u t ho r M a nu s c r i p t s was measured in midbody regions containing a CHMP4B - LAP signal . The mean intensity of the surrounding region was subtracted for background correction , and the first time point after injection was normalized to 0 . Western blot analysis Cells were seeded and transfected as described above in LabTek II chambered coverslips ( ThermoScientific ) . Protein extracts were separated on 4 - 12 % NuPAGE Bis - Tris gradient gels ( Life Technologies ) and transferred to Nitrocellulose ( Protran , GE Healthcare ) or PVDF membranes ( Amersham Hybond , GE Healthcare ) . Western blotting was performed by standard methods using antibodies against CHMP4B ( 1 : 1000 , Abcam , ab105767 ) , actin ( 1 : 30000 , Merck Millipore , MAB1501 ) , VPS4B ( 1 : 500 , Abcam , ab137027 ) , GFP ( 1 : 5000 , Abcam , ab290 ) and GAPDH ( 1 : 2500 , Abcam , ab9485 ) . Electron microscopy of high - pressure frozen cells HeLa cells were seeded in T75 flasks and transfected with siRNAs using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX ( Invitrogen ) . At 23 h post - transfection , a primary shake - off was performed to remove dead cells and debris . Mitotic cells were harvested ~ 2 h later with a second shake - off , and seeded on 3 mm sapphire discs ( M . Wohlwend GmbH ) coated with 0 . 01 % Poly - L - lysine ( Sigma ) in PBS . 97 min later , sapphire discs were transferred to a 3 mm aluminum specimen carrier ( type B , flat side up ) and covered with a second carrier ( type A ) , which had a 50 µm cavity filled with 10 % ( w / v ) BSA ( AppliChem ) in cell culture medium , followed by high - pressure freezing in an HPF Compact 01 ( M . Wohlwend GmbH ) . Freeze substitution was performed using a Leica EM AFS - 2 , in a medium of anhydrous acetone ( Merck ) containing 1 % osmium tetroxide ( Electron Microscopy Sciences ) and 0 . 1 % uranyl acetate ( Merck ) according to the following protocol : 21 h at - 90°C , warm up at a rate of 5°C per hour to - 30°C , 6 h at - 30°C , warm up at a rate of 5°C per hour to 0°C , 2 h at 0°C . Specimen were washed 3 times in anhydrous acetone ( Merck ) at 4°C and embedded in an Epon / Araldite resin ( Electron Microscopy Sciences ) . Serial thin sections of a nominal thickness of 100 nm were collected on Formvar - coated ( Electron Microscopy Science ) copper slot grids ( PLANO ) . Sections were post - stained with 2 % aqueous uranyl acetate ( Polyscience ) and Reynold’s lead citrate ( Electron Microscopy Science ) , and imaged either on a Morgagni 268D transmission electron microscope ( FEI ) at 80 kV with a Morada CCD camera ( Olympus - SIS ) , or on an EM 906 transmission electron microscope ( Zeiss ) at 80 kV with a slow - scan CCD camera ( Albert - Tröndle Systems ) . ESCRT - III protein purification ESCRT - III yeast proteins were expressed from plasmids encoding Snf7 ( Addgene # 21492 ) , Vps2 ( Addgene # 21494 ) , Vps24 ( gift from James Hurley lab ) , Vps4 ( Addgene # 21495 ) and purified as previously described 31 . Snf7 with a cysteine residue at the N - terminus of the protein was purified as in 62 . Snf7 was labeled either with maleimide - Atto - 647N ( Atto - Tec AD 647N - 4 ) , or with TFP - AlexaFluor - 488 ( ThermoFisher Scientific , A - 30005 ) . Vps2 was labeled with Atto - 565 ( Atto - Tec AD 565 - 3 ) , and Vps24 with Atto - 488 ( Atto - Tec AD 488 - 3 ) . The proteins were used at the following concentrations : [ Snf7 ] = 300 nM , [ Vps2 ] = 100 nM , [ Vps24 ] = 100 nM , [ Vps4 ] = 2 µM , except in Fig 6a , b , Supplementary Fig . 5e - g and Supplementary Fig . 7 , where concentrations are indicated in the figures . When added to the Mierzwa et al . Page 12 Nat Cell Biol . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2017 December 12 . E u r op e P M C F und e r s A u t ho r M a nu s c r i p t s E u r op e P M C F und e r s A u t ho r M a nu s c r i p t s reaction , ATP concentration was 2 mM . Fluorescent proteins were mixed with unlabeled proteins at the following ratios : Snf7 - Atto - 647N , Vps2 - Atto - 565 , Vps24 - Atto - 488 : 1 / 3 labeled with 2 / 3 unlabeled ; Snf7 - AlexaFluor - 488 : 2 / 3 labeled with 1 / 3 unlabeled . Preparation of giant unilamellar vesicles ( GUVs ) GUVs were prepared by electroformation using 1 , 2 - dioleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine ( DOPC ) and 1 , 2 - dioleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phospho - L - serine ( DOPS ) mixtures ( Avanti Polar Lipids ) . 20 µl of 1 mg / mL lipid mix ( DOPC : DOPS , 6 : 4 , mol : mol ) were deposited on two indium tin oxide - coated glass slides ( 70 - 100 Ω resistivity , Sigma - Aldrich ) and placed in a vacuum drying oven for 1 h for complete solvent evaporation . An opened tor rubber joint of ~ 1 mm thickness was used as a non - leaky spacer between the two ITO slides , and the chamber was formed by compressing the two slides with spring metal tweezers . The chamber was filled with 400 µl of 500 mM sucrose solution and exposed to 1 V AC - current ( 10 Hz sinusoidal ) at room temperature for 1 h . The resulting suspension was collected in a tube and used within the next days for experiments . Supported lipid bilayer assay The assay is described in detail in 43 . Briefly , to prepare supported membranes , a cleaned coverslip was assembled to a flow chamber ( Sticky - Slide VI 0 . 4 , Ibidi ) , with one entry connected to a syringe pump ( Aladdin , World Precision Instruments ) , and the other left open for sequential introduction of solutions . The flow chamber is initially filled with 200 µL of buffer and 5 µl of GUV suspension . After ~ 5 min , bursting of multiple vesicles was observed on the surface of the coverslip . Then 100 µl of casein ( Sigma - Aldrich ) solution at 1 mg / mL was incubated for 30 min in the flow chamber to block the bare glass around membrane patches . The chamber was then washed with 200 µl of buffer before starting the experiment . The buffer used for all in vitro experiments was composed of 20 mM Tris HCl ( pH 6 . 8 ) , 200 mM NaCl and 1 mM MgCl 2 . An anti - bleaching mix composed of 10 mM glucose , 12 KU / mL catalase , 49 U / mL Glucose Oxidase and 0 . 75 mg / mL Trolox ( Sigma - Aldrich ) was used . When the incubation duration was longer than 20 min , the solution was renewed to avoid loss of the antibleaching mix efficiency ( Fig . 7 , and Supplementary Fig . 7 ) . In vitro imaging and data analysis Imaging was performed using a spinning disc confocal inverted microscope assembled by 3i ( Intelligent Imaging Innovation ) including a Nikon base ( Eclipse C1 , Nikon ) , a 100x 1 . 49 NA oil immersion objective with a CSU - W1 confocal head and a photometrics evolve camera . Nikon perfect focus system was used in combination with a multi - positioning system ( ASI ) to acquire multiple fields of view over time . Imaging was performed only in membrane - covered areas of the coverslip , which were distinguishable from the non - membrane - covered glass surface based on an unspecific background fluorescence of the labeled ESCRT - III subunits adsorbing onto glass . For all experiments , a 2 µm thick volume stack surrounding the coverslip surface was acquired with one minute time lapse . Mierzwa et al . Page 13 Nat Cell Biol . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2017 December 12 . E u r op e P M C F und e r s A u t ho r M a nu s c r i p t s E u r op e P M C F und e r s A u t ho r M a nu s c r i p t s The raw data was processed in 3 steps . First , the 3D stacks were projected in 2D by a Fiji plugin63 , which determines the right focal surface plane along a z - stack . Second , the field illumination inhomogeneity was corrected by dividing all the images by an image of a homogeneously labeled surface . Third , the x - y stage drift throughout the image acquisition was corrected using the plugin Turboreg . For each experiment , patches that did not fuse completely with neighboring patches were manually selected for quantification . For each patch , a slice was manually selected to extract a kymograph . The integrated fluorescence intensity of these kymographs was measured and maximum values were normalized to 1 for all experiments , except for Fig . 7c , where curves were adjusted to match the end point of the experiment . To calculate kinetics of patch disassembly , Snf7 mean patch intensity curves were fitted to exponential decay function . Electron microscopy of ESCRT - III filaments For electron microscopy , multilamellar vesicles made of DOPC : DOPS , 6 : 4 ( mol : mol ) , were prepared at 5 mg / mL . For Snf7 only experiments , vesicles at 0 . 5 mg / mL were incubated for 1 h with Snf7 at 750 nM . For Snf7 + Vps2 + Vps24 experiments , Snf7 was first incubated as before , then Vps2 and Vps24 were added , each at 500 nM final concentration for 1 h . All samples were then centrifuged for 4 min at 4000 g , washed , adsorbed onto Formvar - coated EM grids , then negatively stained for 30 s with 2 % uranyl acetate . Images were acquired using a Tecnai G2 Sphera ( FEI ) electron microscope . Sample preparation for HS - AFM 1 µL of adsorption buffer ( 10 mM Hepes , 220 mM NaCl , 25 mM MgCl2 , pH 7 . 4 ) was added to freshly cleaved mica , followed by addition of 1 µL of the GUVs suspension . GUVs were incubated for 10 min , gently rinsed with imaging buffer ( 10 mM Tris - HCl , 150 mM KCl , pH 7 . 4 ) , before immersion into the HS - AFM fluid chamber ( volume : ~ 120 µL ) . After SLB assessment and image acquisition area positioning , Snf7 was added to the fluid chamber to a final concentration of 1 µM . After ~ 20 min , Snf7 filaments started to form on the SLB and assembled into spiral structures in the following minutes . Vps2 and Vps24 were then added to the AFM fluid chamber to a final concentration of 100 nM . Next , Vps4 was injected to a final concentration of 1 - 2 µM . Finally , ATP and MgCl 2 were added to the fluid chamber to a final concentration of 200 µM and 1 mM , respectively . HS - AFM and image analysis Imaging was performed at room temperature on an HS - AFM 1 . 0 ( RIBM ) using ~ 8 µm long cantilevers ( NanoWorld ) with resonance frequency of ~ 0 . 7 MHz in liquid and a spring constant of ~ 0 . 15 Nm - 1 . Typically , pixel samplings ranged between 300 x 300 pixels and 200 x 200 pixels and frame acquisition rates ranged between 1 s - 1 and 2 s - 1 . For HS - AFM movie analysis , we corrected stage drift using the StackReg plugin in Fiji , and performed a moving average of 2 to 4 consecutive time frames . ESCRT - III spiral diameters and line profiles were manually measured using Fiji . Coefficients of variation were determined for 45 nm - long sections of the line profiles from the ratio of SD to mean . Mierzwa et al . Page 14 Nat Cell Biol .

Tracks shorter than 55 s were omitted from the analysis .

( f ) Quantification of mean velocity of spiral centers from d , e ( n = 34 spirals for with ATP , and n = 31 spirals for without ATP , for a representative experiment per condition , from a total of 3 or 6 independent experiments , respectively ) . Statistical test using the two - sided Kolmogorov – Smirnov test yielded P = 4 . 441e - 16 for spiral velocities in the presence of ATP relative to velocities in the absence of ATP . Dots represent single tracks ; bars indicate medians . ( g ) Model of dynamic ESCRT - III assembly and constriction . Vps4 mediates continuous subunit turnover in ESCRT - III assemblies during growth and constriction . ( 1 ) At the tip , dynamic turnover of growth - inhibitory Vps2 and Vps24 subunits could sustain extension of inward - curving filaments . ( 2 ) At the core of filament bundles , Vps4 - mediated subunit turnover could facilitate sliding of neighboring helical turns to promote constriction . Mierzwa et al . Page 34 Nat Cell Biol .
