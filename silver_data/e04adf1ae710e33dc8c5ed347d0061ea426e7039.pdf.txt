Rab7 Associates with Early Endosomes to Mediate Sorting and Transport of Semliki Forest Virus to Late Endosomes Andreas Vonderheit , Ari Helenius * Institute of Biochemistry , Swiss Federal Institute of Technology , Zurich , Switzerland Semliki forest virus ( SFV ) is internalized by clathrin - mediated endocytosis , and transported via early endosomes to late endosomes and lysosomes . The intracellular pathway taken by individual fluorescently labeled SFV particles was followed using immunofluorescence in untransfected cells , and by video - enhanced , triple - color fluorescence microscopy in live cells transfected with GFP - and RFP - tagged Rab5 , Rab7 , Rab4 , and Arf1 . The viruses progressed from Rab5 - positive early endosomes to a population of early endosomes ( about 10 % of total ) that contained both Rab5 and Rab7 . SFV were sequestered in the Rab7 domains , and they were sorted away from the early endosomes when these domains detached as separate transport carriers devoid of Rab5 , Rab4 , EEA1 , Arf1 , and transferrin . The process was independent of Arf1 and the acidic pH in early endosomes . Nocodazole treatment showed that the release of transport carriers was assisted by microtubules . Expression of constitutively inactive Rab7T22N resulted in accumulation of SFV in early endosomes . We concluded that Rab7 is recruited to early endosomes , where it forms distinct domains that mediate cargo sorting as well as the formation of late - endosome - targeted transport vesicles .

Introduction In the classical clathrin - mediated endocytic pathway , the step from early to late endosomes is crucial for selective transport of cargo and membrane components to lysosomes for degradation . This step involves cargo sorting and segregation , and the transfer occurs either by carrier vesicles that detach from early endosomes , or by the maturation of early endosomes to late endosomes [ 1 – 5 ] . Whereas vesicle trafﬁc from the plasma membrane to early endosomes and homotypic fusion of early endosomes is regulated by a small GTPase , Rab5 [ 6 , 7 ] , and recycling to the plasma membrane depends on Rab4 and Rab11 [ 8 , 9 ] , the factors that mediate cargo transfer from early to late endosomes remain largely unidentiﬁed . In vitro experiments with biochemically puriﬁed endosomes have suggested that this step is mediated by a GTPase , Arf1 . Together with COP I , it is thought to drive the formation of endosomal carrier vesicles ( ECVs ) [ 10 – 13 ] . Low pH inside the endosomes was found to be essential for this process . There is also evidence that Rab7 is critically involved in early to late endosome trafﬁc . Expression of dominant negative Rab7 mutants blocks the exit of certain cargo molecules from early endosomes to late endosomes [ 14 – 16 ] . However , since Rab7 has been localized to late endosomes and lysosomes , it has been proposed that it is not involved in the formation of carrier vesicles at the early endosome but in downstream events [ 17 ] . That Rab7 is also involved in a later step—in trafﬁcking from the late endosome to the lyso - some—is supported by observations in many systems [ 18 – 21 ] . In this study , we have analyzed the sorting of cargo from early to late endosomes using triple - colored , video - enhanced ﬂuorescence microscopy in live cells expressing various Rab - and Arf - GTPases labeled with green , red , yellow , or cyan ﬂuorescent protein ( GFP , RFP , YFP or CFP ) . As endocytic cargo , we used ﬂuorescently labeled Semliki forest virus ( SFV ) —a simple , enveloped RNA virus known to enter cells via the classical clathrin - mediated pathway and to be degraded in lysosomes [ 22 – 24 ] . The main advantage of SFV over most physiological ligands is that ﬂuorescently labeled , individual particles can be visualized and tracked during entry as single identiﬁable ﬂuorescent spots . Our results show that the transport of SFV occurs in Rab7 - positive vesicles formed from Rab7 - positive domains in early endosomes . Although present in early endosomes , Arf1 did not appear to be involved . Results Characterization of Labeled SFV To visualize the entry of SFV in live cells by ﬂuorescence microscopy , we labeled puriﬁed virus with different ﬂuoro - phores : Cy5 ( SFV - Cy5 ) , AlexaFluor594 ( SFV - AF594 ) , and FITC ( SFV - FITC ) .

Together with the small glycopeptide E3 , E1 and E2 form interconnected spike complexes in the envelope [ 25 ] . As expected from its location on the lumenal side of the viral envelope , the capsid protein C was not labeled . Absorbance spectra indicated that virions carried an average of 400 molecules of dye . The labeling process reduced infectivity by about half , from 7 3 10 7 to 3 3 10 7 plaque forming units ( PFU ) per microgram of viral protein . When viewed by ﬂuorescence microscopy , the ﬂuorescent virus particles were visible as spots with a diameter of 0 . 4 – 0 . 5 l m ( shown for SFV - Cy5 in Figure 1B ) . The distribution of the signal could be ﬁt to a single Gaussian function ( blue line in Figure 1B ) with R 2 ¼ 0 . 96 , suggesting that the light was emitted from single particles . Structural studies have shown that the actual diameter of a SFV particle is 70 nm [ 25 ] . When the labeled SFV were allowed to bind to the surface of Vero cells , the staining of the ﬂuorophore - labeled viruses over - lapped completely with the pattern observed by immuno - ﬂuorescence using a polyclonal antibody against E1 and E2 ( Figure S1 ) . Internalization , Penetration , and Degradation SFV particles were bound to the cell surface at 4 8 C for 1 h at a multiplicity of infection ( MOI ) of 20 , the unbound virus was washed away , and the cells were shifted to 37 8 C . Under these conditions , the viruses are rapidly internalized by clathrin - coated vesicles and delivered to endosomes and subsequently to lysosomes , where proteolytic degradation of envelope proteins and unfused viruses occurs [ 22 ] . The progressive movement could be followed using the ﬂuorescently labeled virus in Vero cells ( Figure 2A – 2C ) . As previously reported [ 26 ] , the viruses were ﬁrst observed as individual spots on the cell surface . Confocal microscopy of ﬁxed and immunostained cells 10 min after warming showed the majority of internalized viruses in compartments positive for early endosome antigen 1 ( EEA1 ) , a Rab5 effector and an early endosome marker [ 27 , 28 ] ( Figure 2A ) . At this time , many virus particles were still on the cell surface ( Figure S2 ) . After 20 min of warming , many viruses were already present in compartments positive for Rab7 ( Figure 2B ) , a late endosomal marker [ 29 ] . Only after 30 min or longer could overlap be observed with lysosome associated membrane protein 1 ( LAMP - 1 ) , a marker for lysosomes [ 30 , 31 ] ( Figure 2C ) . To determine the timing of the acid - activated penetration event leading to infection , SFV was allowed to bind to the cells in the cold at a MOI of one . At different times after warming , 20 mM NH 4 Cl was added . Like other lysosomo - tropic weak bases , NH 4 Cl raises the pH in acidic organelles almost instantaneously [ 32 ] , and prevents further acid activation of incoming viruses . After 5 h , the fraction of infected cells was determined using an indirect FACS - based assay , in which newly synthesized viral proteins were detected with an anti - E1 / E2 antibody . In agreement with results from other cell types [ 33 ] , the acid - induced fusion events started between 2 and 3 min after warming and reached a half maximal level at 6 min ( Figure 2D ) . Following a lag phase , SFV endocytosis is known to result in efﬁcient degradation of E1 and E2 proteins in lysosomes [ 34 ] . When degradation was analyzed in Vero cells by immuno - blotting using anti - E1 / E2 antibodies , it was found to start 30 min after warming ( Figure 2E ) . In this experiment , Proteinase K – mediated removal of surface - bound viruses showed that about half of the cell - associated virus particles ( 52 % ) were endocytosed . For the incoming virus , the course of events in Vero cells thus followed a program that involved ( 1 ) rapid internal - ization , ( 2 ) exposure to low pH in early endosomes ( 2 – 15 min ) , and ( 3 ) transfer to late endosomes and lysosomes ( starting after 20 min ) . Through all these different compart - ments , the size and intensity of ﬂuorescent spots representing individual virus particles remained roughly unaltered ( data not shown ) . This meant that even when the viruses fused and E1 and E2 became part of the endosomal membrane , the glycoproteins did not diffuse away from each other . This behavior of SFV membranes has previously been observed after fusion with the plasma membrane [ 35 ] . Localization of Endocytic Markers To study the distribution of markers in endosomal compartments , we performed double immunoﬂuorescence experiments with untransfected cells . We used antibodies to EEA1 ( an effector of Rab5 ) [ 27 , 28 ] , and antibodies to Rab7 Figure 1 .

When the distribution was compared , we observed , as have others , that these early and late endosomal markers were largely separated ( Figure 3A , arrowheads ) . However , closer inspection and quantiﬁcation showed that 13 . 6 % of the EEA1 - positive organelles were also stained with anti - Rab7 antibodies ( arrows ) . In CV - 1 and HeLa cells the correspond - ing numbers were 13 . 1 % and 12 . 8 % , respectively ( Figures S3 and S4 ) . To determine whether the overlap was coincidental , we quantiﬁed the extent of overlap between EEA1 and COP II , which do not associate with common organelles ( Figure S5 ) . The apparent overlap was 4 . 6 % ( Figure S5B and S5C ) . The measured overlap between EEA1 and caveolin - 1 , which is known to form a domain in some of the early endosomes [ 37 ] , was 10 . 5 % ( Figure S5A ) . We concluded that the co - local - ization of EEA1 and Rab7 was real , and that about one in ten EEA1 - positive endosomes contained detectable amounts of Rab7 . The double - labeled endosomes often displayed distinct red and green regions , suggesting location of EEA1 and Rab7 in separate domains of the mosaic structure of the endosomal membrane ( Figures 3A , S3 , and S4 , arrows ) [ 38 , 39 ] . To analyze the endosomes in live cells , we expressed a variety of ﬂuorescent - protein - labeled small GTPases known to occur in distinct endosomal compartments : Rab5 for early endosomes , Rab4 for early and recycling endosomes , and Rab7 for late endosomes [ 6 , 8 , 29 ] . We also expressed Arf1 , which has been reported to be present on early endosomes and ECVs [ 12 ] . First , the localization of GFP - Rab5 and RFP - Rab7 was determined in ﬁxed , transfected cells by confocal microscopy in the absence of virus ( Figure 3B ) . As expected , most of the Rab5 - and Rab7 - positive structures were localized in distinct organelles , at least when viewed in the peripheral regions of the cytoplasm where individual organelles were easily distinguished ( arrowheads ) . However , again in every cell a population of GFP - Rab5 - positive endosomes ( 14 . 6 % ) could be observed also positive for RFP - Rab7 ( arrows ) . That these were indeed hybrid organelles was conﬁrmed in live video recordings of unﬁxed cells by the coordinated movement of both ﬂuorescent colors ( Videos S1 – S3 ) . The distinct red and green regions ( domains ) in the endosomes were persistent features also in live cells . When GFP - Rab4 and RFP - Rab5 were co - expressed , 37 . 7 % of the Rab5 - positive endosomes contained Rab4 , and when Arf1 - GFP and RFP - Rab5 were expressed , 35 . 5 % of the Rab5 endosomes contained the labeled Arf1 ( Figure 3C and 3D ) , Figure 2 . Internalization , Penetration , and Degradation SFV - Cy5 ( at a MOI of 20 ) was allowed to bind to Vero cells for 60 min at 4 8 C , followed by transfer to 37 8 C for different time periods . ( A ) The cells were fixed and permeabilized 10 min after warming , followed by immunostaining using antibodies to EEA1 . SFV - Cy5 is present in EEA1 - positive endosomes . ( B ) The cells were fixed 20 min after warming and immunostained with anti - Rab7 antibodies . SFV - Cy5 is present in Rab7 - positive endosomes . ( C ) Non - labeled SFV was used , and the cells were fixed and permeabilized 30 min after warming and immunostained with anti - LAMP - 1 and anti - E1 / E2 antibodies . SFV is present in endosomes positive for LAMP - 1 . ( D ) A FACS - based infection assay was used to determine the time course of SFV penetration during entry . Vero cells were infected with a MOI of one . NH 4 Cl was added at different time points to inhibit infection . Cells were further incubated at 37 8 C for 5 h , then fixed and immunostained for newly synthesized glycoproteins ( n ¼ 3 ) . ( E ) Analysis of E1 / E2 degradation was determined using immunoblotting . Virus ( MOI of 50 ) was bound to Vero cells in the cold , and unbound virus was washed away . Cells were incubated for indicated times , and surface - associated viruses were removed by Proteinase K treatment . Cells were lysed , and after SDS - PAGE , immunoblotting was performed with an antibody against E1 / E2 . Note that contrary to non - reduced samples ( Figure 1A ) , E1 and E2 co - migrate in SDS - PAGE after reduction . Scale bars represent 5 l m .

When RFP - Rab7 and GFP - Rab4 were co - expressed , some double - stained vesicles ( 12 . 3 % ) could also be observed ( Figure 3E , arrows ) . The same was observed for Arf1 - GFP and RFP - Rab7 ( 12 . 5 % ) ( Figure 3F ) . These ﬁndings were consistent with the presence of Rab7 in some early endosomal structures . As expected , immuno - ﬂuorescence showed that Rab7 was present in LAMP - 1 - positive structures . We found that of Rab7 - positive organ - elles , 46 % contained LAMP - 1 ( data not shown ) . SFV in Rab7 - Positive Early Endosomes To analyze the endosomes that were reached by the virus , SFV - Cy5 was allowed to bind to Vero cells in the cold . The particle to cell ratio was kept low ( 20 PFU / cell ) so that individual particles could be followed , and endosomes would not receive multiple SFV particles . The cells were then washed , shifted to 37 8 C for different times up to 180 min , ﬁxed , immunolabeled with anti - EEA1 and anti - Rab7 , and analyzed by confocal microscopy . As shown in Figure 4A ( panel a ) , at 0 min the SFV particles ( blue ) did not co - localize Figure 3 .

After 10 min ( Figure 4A , panel b ) , most of the virus particles co - localized with EEA1 in early endosomes . After 20 min ( Figure 4A , panel c ) , many of the virus particles were located in the endosomes positive for both EEA1 and Rab7 , and from 30 min onwards ( Figure 4A , panel d ) , an increasing fraction was seen in organelles stained by Rab7 alone . To quantify these observations , we viewed 260 virus Figure 4 . Progression of SFV through Endosomes Labeled for EEA1 and Rab7 ( A ) Confocal microscopy of Vero cells . SFV - Cy5 was allowed to bind to Vero cells ( at a MOI of 20 ) for 60 min at 4 8 C , followed by transfer to 37 8 C and fixed after different times ( a , 0 min ; b , 10 min ; c , 20 min ; d , 30 min ) and immunolabeled with EEA1 and anti - Rab7 antibodies . Shown are three viruses for each time point . Scale bars represent 10 l m . In panel a , SFV do not co - localize with any endosomal marker ; in panel b , SFV are localized in EEA1 - positive endosomes ; in panel c , SFV are localized in EEA1 - and Rab7 - positive endosomes ; and in panel d , SFV are localized in Rab7 - positive endosomes .

The results ( Figure 4B ) were normalized so that 100 % represented the number of cell - associated viruses at each time point corrected for the degradation . The results showed a progression of the internalized viruses through different endosome subpopulations . Co - localization with EEA1 without Rab7 peaked at 10 min ( Figure 4B , green line ) . It dropped off rapidly and was replaced by a population positive for both EEA1 and Rab7 ( blue line ) , with a maximum at 20 min . This was followed by organelles positive for Rab7 but negative for EEA1 ( red line ) starting at 30 min and persisting until 180 min . What was new and unexpected in these observations was that the viruses passed through an endosomal organelle population that contained both EEA1 and Rab7 . This occurred in the time period 10 – 60 min after warming . As shown above , such EEA1 - and Rab7 - positive organelles were present whether SFV was added or not . We modeled SFV transit through the different endosomal compartments using coupled ﬁrst - order reactions ( Kinetikit / GENESIS ) [ 40 ] assuming unidirectional transport : [ plasma membrane ] ﬁ [ early EEA1 - positive endosome ] ﬁ [ hybrid EEA1 - and Rab7 - positive endosome ] ﬁ [ late Rab7 - positive endosome ] ﬁ [ degradation ] . A set of parameters was found that allowed a ﬁt with the experimental data in Figure 4B ( Figure S6 ) . These parameters suggested that all the viruses that ended up in late endosomes passed through the hybrid compartment . Moreover , the model allowed us to estimate the average residence times of SFV in the different endo - somal compartments . They were 10 min for the early endosomal compartments , 16 min for the hybrid endosomes , and 52 min for the late endosomal compartments . When GFP - Rab5 - and RFP - Rab7 - transfected cells were allowed to internalize SFV - Cy5 , the progression of the virus particles could be observed by confocal microscopy in live Vero cells ( Figure 5A ) ; the majority of viruses were ﬁrst located in organelles that were positive for GFP - Rab5 , later in organelles that were positive for both GFP - Rab5 and RFP - Rab7 , and ﬁnally in RFP - Rab7 - positive organelles . A similar progression of virus through endosomal compartments was observed in ﬁxed and live CV - 1 ( Figure S7A and S7B ) and HeLa cells ( Figure S7C and S7D ) , although progress through the pathway was less synchronous in these cells . It is noteworthy that the expression of GFP - Rab5 and / or RFP - Rab7 did not affect SFV infection of Vero cells , consistent with reports that these chimeric proteins have no adverse effect on the pathway [ 37 ] . A closer look at the distribution of GFP - Rab5 , RFP - Rab7 , and SFV - Cy5 in endosomes showed a typical ‘‘ mosaic ’’ distribution of the Rabs [ 38 ] . GFP - Rab5 and RFP - Rab7 were as a rule distributed in distinct domains of the organelle ( Figure 5A ) . That they were part of a common structure , and that the virus was trapped in it , was evident when endosomes in live cells were viewed over time ; the three labels often moved together in the cytoplasm as parts of the same organelle ( Videos S4 and S5 ) . An uneven distribution of ﬂuorescent markers was also seen in the endosomes of HeLa and CV - 1 cells whether viewed after immunoﬂuorescence staining for EEA1 and Rab7 in ﬁxed , untransfected cells ( Figure S7A and S7C ) , or viewed in live cells expressing the ﬂuorescent - protein - labeled Rabs ( Figure S7B and S7D ) . Sorting of Rab7 and SFV from Early Endosomes When the fate of SFV - Cy5 - containing endosomes was followed by video microscopy , separation of the RFP - Rab7 - positive domain and the virus from the GFP - Rab5 - labeled domains could frequently be seen . The hybrid endosome was split in two : one part contained the Rab5 , and the other the Rab7 and the virus particle . In the examples shown in Figure 5A and Videos S4 and S5 , the SFV - Cy5 - and RFP - Rab7 - positive particle moved away while the Rab5 - containing remnant remained stationary . In 70 % of the cases recorded ( n ¼ 23 ) this was the case . In the other 30 % of cases , it seemed that both parts of the endosome moved away after ﬁssion , in opposite directions . The viral cargo was thus transferred from an early endosome that contained both Rab5 and Rab7 to a detached organelle that contained Rab7 but no Rab5 . In all analyzed time series , the virus always left the Rab5 / Rab7 compartment together with Rab7 , and Rab5 was left behind . We never observed the virus leaving an early endosome compartment without Rab7 . It was therefore possible that formation of the Rab7 - positive carrier vesicle was triggered by the presence of the virus . That the virus was not necessary , however , was shown by the observation that Rab7 - positive vesicles could be seen leaving Rab5 - and Rab7 - positive endosomes in cells to which no virus was added ( see Video S3 ) . To conﬁrm that the organelles that SFV were leaving were in fact early endosomes , we transfected either RFP - Rab5 or RFP - Rab7 together with another early endosomal marker , GFP - Rab4 . We then allowed SFV - Cy5 to be internalized for 20 min . Rab4 is known to be present in early and recycling endosomes [ 8 , 9 ] . In live recordings , the SFV glycoproteins ( blue ) could be observed to sort away from both Rab4 and Rab5 ( Figure 5B ; Video S6 ) . In cells expressing GFP - Rab4 and RFP - Rab7 the departure occurred together with Rab7 , leaving Rab4 quantitatively behind ( Figure 5C ; Video S7 ) . Furthermore , we used ﬂuorescently labeled transferrin . We loaded RFP - Rab5 - or RFP - Rab7 - expressing cells with trans - ferrin - AlexaFluor488 and added SFV - Cy5 ( Figure S8A and S8B ; Videos S8 and S9 ) . SFV was present in the transferrin - and Rab5 - positive early endosomes . When the sorting of SFV and Rab7 took place 20 min after internalization , transferrin failed to be included in the carrier vesicles . When a constitutively inactive GFP - Rab7T22N mutant and RFP - Rab5 were expressed together , we saw that the Rab5 - positive early endosomes were bigger and more rounded than in cells without the Rab7 mutant ( Figure 5D ) . The same was true for GFP - Rab7T22N - expressing cells stained for EEA1 ( Figure 5E ) . Rab7 was not associated with any membrane organelles . When SFV - Cy5 was allowed to enter these cells for 1 h , we found that it was internalized but failed to leave the enlarged Rab5 / EEA1 - positive compartments . Consistent with capture in early endosomes , almost none of the SFV localized to LAMP - 1 structures ( Figure 5F , arrowheads ) , whereas in control cells many did ( arrows ) . Quantiﬁcation showed that 86 . 3 % of the viruses remained co - localized with EEA1 and only 3 . 9 % co - localized with LAMP - 1 - containing organelles . This indicated that forward transport of SFV was inhibited by GFP - Rab7T22N at the level of early endosomes [ 14 – 16 ] . Active Rab7 was evidently needed for the transfer of SFV from this compartment . The inhibition in transport to late endosomes was likely the reason why the early endosomes were enlarged in these cells .

To test whether Arf1 mediates this sorting step for SFV , we transfected cells with Arf1 - GFP and either RFP - Rab5 ( Figure 6A ; Video S10 ) or RFP - Rab7 ( Figure 6B ; Video S11 ) . We then followed the fate of SFV - Cy5 in these cells over time in confocal video recordings . It was relatively easy to ﬁnd endosomes labeled with Arf1 - GFP , RFP - Rab5 , and SFV - Cy5 . The three colors did not overlap completely , but moved together through the cyto - plasm , indicating that Arf1 , Rab5 , and the virus were present in distinct domains of the same endosome . Figure 6A and Video S10 show how the virus leaves such an endosome . From several video movies like this , we concluded that when the virus leaves , both Arf1 - GFP and RFP - Rab5 stay behind .

In this case , the virus and RFP - Rab7 left the endosome together , with Arf1 - GFP staying behind ( Figure 6B ; Video S11 ) . Furthermore , when we used the myc - tagged dominant negative mutant Arf1T31N , we found SFV - Cy5 in GFP - Rab7 - positive endosomes and not in GFP - Rab5 - positive endosomes after 1 h of warming ( Figure 6C and 6D ) . Quantiﬁcation showed that 86 . 6 % of the viruses entered a Rab7 - positive endosome , whereas only 5 . 9 % remained in a Rab5 - positive endosome . It was clear that SFV was not using Arf1 - containing domains or vesicles for transport from the early to late endosomes , indicating that Arf1 was not needed for sorting of SFV into Rab7 vesicles . It has been reported that the transport of certain cargo by ECVs from early to late endosomes is pH - dependent [ 12 ] . To test in live cells whether this is true for SFV , we used drugs ( NH 4 Cl and Baﬁlomycin A 1 ) to neutralize the pH in endocytic organelles . That these agents did indeed neutralize the pH as Figure 6 .

We found that when SFV - Cy5 was allowed to enter for 2 h in the presence of the drugs , it reached Rab7 - positive compartments devoid of Rab5 ( Figure 6E ) . The same was observed for a ﬂuid phase marker , Dextran – Texas Red ( Figure 6F ) . We concluded that sorting of SFV from early endosomes to late endosomes did not require an acidic endosomal pH . Furthermore , since the virus did not penetrate under these conditions , sorting was independent of the fusion of the viral envelope with the endosomal membrane . Evidently , SFV was sorted into late endosomes and ﬁnally into lysosomes even if it had not released its capsid into the cytoplasm . The Role of Microtubules It is well known that endosomes can move along micro - tubules [ 36 , 41 – 43 ] . When recording in cells expressing tubulin - GFP , complex bidirectional movement of GFP - Rab7 - labeled late endosomes and RFP - Rab5 - labeled early endosomes along microtubules could be monitored ( Video S12 ) . When the microtubule - disrupting drug nocodazole was added and the cells were incubated for 30 min , we observed larger and more numerous endosomes ( Figure 7A ) . The majority of these were positive for both GFP - Rab5 and RFP - Rab7 ( approximately 75 % ) . Again the two Rabs were , as a rule , located in nonoverlapping domains ( Figure 7A , arrow - heads ) . In untransfected cells that were immunostained for EEA1 and Rab7 the effect of nocodazole was not as dramatic , but still many of the EEA1 - positive endosomes were positive for Rab7 ( approximately 41 % ) ( Figure 7C ) . When SFV - Cy5 was allowed to enter cells transfected with GFP - Rab5 and RFP - Rab7 and treated with nocodazole for 1 h , SFV - Cy5 was found to co - localize with the GFP - Rab5 - and RFP - Rab7 - positive endosomes ( Figure 7B ) . We observed the same in untransfected cells immunostained for EEA1 and Rab7 ( Figure 7C ) . These observations were consistent with a role for microtubules and microtubule - dependent motors in the separation of early endosomes and Rab7 - positive carrier vesicles . That nocodazole had little effect on SFV infection ( not shown ) was expected given that penetration occurs at the level of early endosomes devoid of Rab7 . Accordingly , expression of the dominant negative Rab5S34N mutant inhibits SFV infection whereas expression of the correspond - ing Rab7 mutant ( Rab7T22N ) does not [ 44 ] . Discussion The classical endocytosis pathway from clathrin - coated pits to lysosomes is well studied but far from fully understood . One of the unresolved issues concerns the mechanisms of molecular sorting in early endosomes , and the mechanism of cargo transfer from early to late endosomes and lysosomes . It is unclear whether the process involves maturation of early endosomes to late ones by gradual modiﬁcation of membrane components , or by the formation of carrier vesicles between permanent compartments [ 45 ] . As reported by others the limiting membrane of endosomes contains a mosaic of domains with different composition and distinct functions [ 17 , 38 , 39 , 46 , 47 ] . In early endosomes , the Rab5 domains are the most prominent and best analyzed . Rab5 regulates homotypic endosome fusion and incoming vesicle trafﬁc Figure 7 .

Endosomes positive for both markers can be seen ( white rectangles ) ( 41 % ) , and SFV - Cy5 is captured in these structures ( yellow rectangles ) . The protrusions of Rab5 shown in ( A ) are not seen in ( C ) and are probably caused by overexpression of the Rab proteins . Scale bar represents 10 l m .

The Rab4 domains , which are also present in early endosomes , organize recycling to the plasma membrane [ 8 , 9 , 38 ] . In addition , early endosomes are known to have domains containing Arf1 and COP I , caveolin - 1 , clathrin , and Rab11 [ 12 , 37 , 38 , 48 – 50 ] . As cargo , we made use of labeled SFV , which we could easily follow in live cells during its journey through the endosomal system . After binding to proteoglycans and internalization via coated pits , SFV particles are known to pass rapidly from early endosomes to late endosomes and lysosomes [ 22 , 23 , 26 , 51 – 53 ] . Triggered by the mildly acidic pH ( , 6 . 2 . ) in early endosomes , membrane fusion is induced by the E1 glycoprotein , and the capsid is released into the cytosol , where the viral RNA is rapidly uncoated [ 22 , 54 , 55 ] . After fusion with the endosomal membrane the viral glycoproteins stay together as a patch [ 35 ] , and are trans - ported to lysosomes to be degraded together with unfused virus particles [ 56 ] . The most important new observation presented in this work came from following sorting of the virus from early Rab5 - and EEA1 - positive endosomes to late Rab7 - positive , Rab5 - negative endosomes . Neutralization using NH 4 Cl showed that the infective fusion reactions occurred when the virus was still in Rab5 - positive endosomes devoid of Rab7 . Shortly thereafter , a large fraction of the virus - containing early endosomes became positive for Rab7 . In video record - ings of live cells , these Rab7 - enriched domains could be seen to detach with the labeled virus from the rest of the endosome , leaving no detectable Rab7 behind . The Rab7 - positive vesicles were then seen to carry the virus away along microtubules . Occasionally , fusion of such vesicles with larger Rab7 - containing organelles could be seen ( Videos S13 and S14 ) . Co - immunostaining of EEA1 and Rab7 showed that Rab7 occurred in about one out of ten early endosomes , also in cells that did not contain any virus and did not express any ﬂuorescent - protein - tagged proteins ( Figure S5C ) . On the basis of these results , we propose that Rab7 can associate transiently with early endosomes . Since we did not observe arrival of GFP - Rab7 in vesicles , we assume that it binds directly from the cytosol . When abundant enough , it forms an endosomal domain that excludes Rab5 , Rab4 , Arf1 , and transferrin . SFV moves selectively into this domain . Given the inhibitory effect of Rab7T22N , we further propose that the formation and / or detachment of these domains as independent carrier vesicles is Rab7 - dependent . The mech - anism of carrier vesicle formation appears to be independent of Arf1 , and unlike Arf1 - dependent formation of ECVs it is not inﬂuenced by endosomal pH . The ﬁnal separation of the Rab7 - and Rab5 - containing elements is accelerated by trans - port of the Rab7 - containing vesicles along microtubules . Our model is shown schematically in Figure 8 . In brief , we propose that the virus uses a Rab7 - regulated pathway from early to late endosomes , and that Rab7 domains in early endosomes are involved both in the sorting of the virus and in the formation of a transport vesicle . Rab7 has been shown to be enriched in late endosomes in mammalian cells and yeast , and it is commonly thought to play an important role in fusion and transport of cargo from late endosomes to lysosomes [ 18 – 21 , 57 ] . However , a role has also been suggested in the early to late endosome transport step [ 14 – 16 , 57 , 58 ] . This is because overexpression of Rab7 has been shown to accelerate transfer of some cargo molecules to late endosomes and lysosomes [ 58 , 59 ] . Furthermore , trans - port of mannose 6 - phosphate receptor ( CI - MPR ) , CXCR2 , cathepsin D , VSV G - protein , SV5 hemagglutinin - neuramini - dase , and the LDL receptor are , like SFV , blocked at the level of early endosomes after expression of dominant negative Rab7 [ 14 – 16 ] . That Rab7 is involved in the transfer of other viruses is suggested by the report that inﬂuenza A virus , which fuses at the level of late endosomes , does not infect cells expressing the constitutively inactive Rab7 mutant protein [ 44 ] . Co - localization of Rab5 and Rab7 has not been observed in most localization studies [ 19 , 29 ] . However , consistent with our observations , partial co - localization was recently re - ported in HEK 293 cells [ 58 ] . One reason why the co - localization may have been missed in other studies is that only a rather small fraction ( approximately 14 % ) of endosomes have both Rabs at any given time , and when they do , Rab7 and Rab5 ( and its effector EEA1 ) occur in distinct domains . That the proteins are , in fact , part of the same structure is particularly apparent in video recordings where the Rab5 - and Rab7 - positive domains can be observed to move together as part of a common organelle . The separation of the various GTPases into distinct parts in an early endosome was not only visible when they were expressed as ﬂuorescent - protein - tagged proteins but also when viewed in ﬁxed control cells after immunoﬂuorescence staining . Since our results indicate that Rab7 is directly involved in Figure 8 . Schematic Representation of the SFV Transport Pathway from the Plasma Membrane to Lysosomes After uncoating of clathrin , the primary endocytic vesicles deliver the virus to Rab5 - positive early endosomes , which contain Rab5 and Arf1 domains but do not contain Rab7 . Rab7 is then recruited to these endosomes , and it forms additional domains ( blue ) that exclude the other early endosome - associated small GTPases . The virus moves into the Rab7 domain , and when this domain leaves the endosome as a Rab7 - containing transport vesicle , the virus also leaves the Rab5 - positive organelle . The Rab7 - containing carrier moves along microtubules and fuses with other carriers or late endosomes . Also shown is an alternative route from the early to the late endosome , involving Arf1 and the ECV , which is not used by SFV .

These were clearly visible in about every third Rab5 - positive early endosome . Do they induce ECVs for a parallel pathway to late endosomes , or do they serve some other function ? Whereas Rab7 - positive vesicles were fre - quently seen to depart from Rab5 - and Rab4 - positive endo - somes , we did not observe detachment of Arf1 - positive carriers corresponding to the description of ECVs . Evidence for the ECV pathway and its sensitivity to elevated lumenal pH has been obtained by in vitro experiments using puriﬁed endosome fractions [ 12 , 13 ] . However , it is possible that more than one pathway connects early and late endosomes , and that degradation of SFV makes use of the Rab7 pathway . Whether the recruitment of Rab7 is part of an automatic process of early endosome maturation or whether it depends on the presence of speciﬁc cargo remains to be determined . Clearly , the virus as such was not required because association of Rab7 and shedding of Rab7 vesicles from early endosomes could be readily observed also in the absence of SFV . It will be important in future work to follow the fate of other cargo molecules in live cells , and determine whether there are indeed multiple pathways and , if so , how they relate to the Rab7 pathway . The identiﬁcation of upstream regulatory elements and effectors of Rab7 must also become a priority . Currently , only a few Rab7 - interacting factors are known , and none of them in early endosomes . The association of endosomes and carrier vesicles with micro - tubules also deserves close attention because microtubules and microtubule motors may play a role not only in the transport of vesicles but also in their formation or detach - ment . Materials and Methods Cells , virus , antibodies , and reagents . Vero cells were maintained in MEM ( plus Earle’s plus GlutaMAXI ) supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum and nonessential amino acids ( Gibco BRL , San Diego , California , United States ) . During live microscopy 20 mM Hepes ( pH 7 . 4 ) was added to the medium to render the medium CO 2 - independent . A prototype tissue - culture - adapted strain of SFV was grown in BHK - 21 cells and puriﬁed as described [ 26 , 60 ] .

Fluorescent labeling of SFV was essentially done as described [ 26 ] . Puriﬁed virus was dialyzed in 0 . 1 M carbonate buffer ( pH 8 . 3 ) , and treated for 1 h at room temperature with the different ﬂuorophores ( Cy5 , FITC , or AF594 ) using a 1 : 4 molar excess of ﬂuorophore over E1 and E2 . The ﬂuorophores react with free amines , resulting in a stable carbox - amide bond with the viral proteins . The labeled virus was puriﬁed again on a 5 % – 60 % sucrose gradient in TN buffer ( 50 mM Tris [ pH 7 . 4 ] , 100 mM NaCl ) . The extracted virus band was stored at 4 8 C .

For live microscopy , transfected cells were seeded on 18 - mm glass coverslips and before analysis transferred to custom - built metal microscope - slide chambers ( Anton Lehmann , Workshop Biochemistry , Swiss Federal Institute of Technology , Zurich , Switzer - land ) in medium plus 20 mM Hepes ( pH 7 . 4 ) . The chamber was mounted on a heated stage and analyzed at 37 8 C using wide ﬁeld or confocal microscopy . For wide ﬁeld microscopy , cells were analyzed using a Zeiss ( Oberkochen , Germany ) Axiovert microscope equipped with a 100 3 plan - apochromat lens NA 1 . 40 . Images were collected using a cooled charge - coupled - device camera ( ORCA - ER , Hamamat - su , Hamamatsu City , Japan ) , and the software used was OpenLab . Alternatively , an Olympus ( Hamburg , Germany ) IX71microscope was used with a PlanApo 60 3 NA 1 . 45 oil immersion objective and a polychrome II monochromator ( TILL Photonics , Martinsried , Ger - many ) with the TILLvisION software , version 4 . 0 ( TILL Photonics ) . For confocal microscopy the Zeiss 510Meta was used with a 100 3 1 . 4 NA objective and with an Argon laser ( 458 , 477 , 488 , 514 ) 30 mW , HeNe laser ( 543 nm ) 1 mW , or HeNe laser ( 633 nm ) 5 mW . Images were processed using Image J ( National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , Maryland , United States ) and Adobe Photoshop ( Adobe Systems , San Jose , California , United States ) . Immunoﬂuorescence . Cells were ﬁxed using medium containing 4 % formaldehyde , quenched with 50 mM NH 4 Cl , permeabilized with 0 . 05 % saponin , and then incubated with primary antibodies over - night at 4 8 C . Cells were incubated with the appropriate secondary antibodies . Coverslips were mounted with ImmuMount from Thermo Shandon ( Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , United States ) . Virus binding and infection . SFV was added to cells in MEM ( EAGLE ) containing nonessential amino acids , 5 % BSA , and 20 mM Hepes ( pH 7 . 4 ) and allowed to bind for 1 h at 4 8 C [ 26 ] . Still on ice , the cells were washed with ice - cold PBS to remove the unbound virus . Then the cells were shifted to 37 8 C for different times to start the synchronized infection . For microscopy 1 – 3 l g of virus was used per coverslip . The timing of SFV penetration was determined as previously described [ 26 ] . By adding 20 mM NH 4 Cl to cells at different times after warming , acid activation of additional incoming virus particles could be blocked . To determine the fraction of cells that had been infected , a FACS - based infection assay was used [ 64 ] . The cells were stained with anti - E1 / E2 antibodies and as secondary antibodies AlexaFluor488 - labeled ( green ) or AlexaFluor647 - R - phycoerythrin - labeled goat anti - rabbit IgG ( Molecular Probes ) was used . Analysis was performed on a FACS - Calibur cytometer using CellQuest 3 . 1f software ( Becton - Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems , San Jose , California , United States ) . More than 50 , 000 cells were analyzed for each sample , and at least two independent experiments were performed . Internalization of Dextran – Texas Red . Dextran – Texas Red ( 10 , 000 MW ) was added to cells on ice for at least 30 min , then the cells were shifted to 37 8 C for 10 min , followed by extensive washing with warm PBS to remove the not yet internalized Dextran – Texas Red . Cells were further incubated for 2 h at 37 8 C . Degradation of the glycoproteins E1 and E2 . After binding of SFV at a MOI of 50 and washing , the cells were moved to 37 8 C . At the indicated times , cells were placed on ice and incubated for 45 min with 0 . 5 mg / ml Proteinase K in PBS [ 26 ] . Cells were removed , washed in PBS / 1 mM PMSF ( phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride ) / 0 . 2 % BSA , pelleted , and dissolved in 50 l l of 50 mM Tris ( pH 8 . 0 ) / 2 % SDS / 2 mM PMSF , followed by 10 min of heating at 99 8 C and TCA precipitation . The precipitate was redissolved in sample buffer , heated , and subjected to SDS - PAGE . Immunoblotting was done with an antibody against E1 / E2 [ 62 ] . Nocodazole treatment . To disrupt microtubules , 5 l M nocodazole was added to the cells . They were incubated on ice for 30 min to support disruption and then analyzed or infected with SFV and then analyzed .
