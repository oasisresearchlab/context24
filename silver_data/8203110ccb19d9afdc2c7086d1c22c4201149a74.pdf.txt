Based on the comprehensive analysis of ICESat / GLAS14 data from 2003 to 2009 and CryoSat - 2 / L2I data from 2010 to 2016 in summer season . This paper revealed the elevation changes of mountain glaciers in small watershed scale in southeastern Qinghai - Tibet Plateau by using outliner elevation of footprints , spatial matching analysis of DEM and elevation trends simulation methods . The result showed , the data of effective footprints of ICESat is significantly higher than CryoSat data on mountain glaciers . Glaciers in the study area has been regressed significantly from 2003 to 2016 , with the average regression rate in the study area is - 1 . 05 ± 0 . 53ma - 1 , and a correlation coefficient of 0 . 72 . Compared with the result of other similar studies in southeastern Tibet , the mountain glacier regression rate is credible . Meanwhile , the feasibility of mountain glacier elevation change monitoring in small watershed by CryoSat - 2 data has been proven . 1 . Introduction Owing to its high coverage , high precision , periodic nature , and wide range , satellite altimetry has been widely applied to the altitude detection of glaciers and their periodic changes [ 1 ] . With onboard instruments , such as microwave radiometer , radar altimeter , and synthetic aperture radar , altimeter satellites can measure the distance from the earth’s surface to the sensor , thus providing relevant data for geodetic surveys of surface elevation variation , geodesy , and applications in geophysics [ 2 ] . ICESat laser altimetry data are currently preferred for studying surface elevation changes in large - scale glaciers . However , because of the strong characteristics of laser particles , ICESat data are affected by clouds , particularly floating snow particles . For example , in the southeastern part of the Qinghai – Tibet Plateau , where cloud and rain coverage are high , measurement data are likely to be discontinuous [ 3 ] . As a representative case of radar altimetry data , CryoSat - 2 data have been widely used for studying polar glaciers and sea ice but rarely for the monitoring of inland glaciers . CryoSat - 2 data are highly universal owing to the high - precision parameter design and good performance for polar glacier measurement [ 4 ] . Unlike laser - based height measurement , surface exploration by radar altimetry can be conducted all - day and in all - weather . Therefore , for mountain glaciers distributed in southeast Tibet , CryoSat - 2 data products have more application prospects . They can effectively supplement the temporal and spatial continuities in ICESat data , and provide promising solutions for the continuous study of surface elevation changes in the mountain glaciers of this area . Recently , altimeter satellites have been employed to study the changes in the material balance of the frozen soil in the Qinghai – Tibet Plateau [ 5 ] ; however , studies on glacier elevation variations at small watershed scales are relatively lacking . To verify the effectiveness of altimeter radar in monitoring mountain glacier changes and to integrate different altitude sensor data , this study selected The Fourth International Workshop on Environment and Geoscience IOP Conf .

Data process 2 . 1 . Outliner elimination of elevation footprint Considering the snow seasons in study area , this paper chose the summer data for elevation anayls . After applying pretreatment to the data from ICESat GLAS and CryoSat 14 - 2 / L2I , which cover the glaciers in the Yigong River Basin , the elevation value at the measurement point was found to contain several errors in the two types of height measuring products . The superposition of the results of altimetry data and existing DEM data could effectively eliminate the outliers . Specifically , the height measurement data were preprocessed to generate point files , the corresponding elevations obtained from the ASTER GDEM and SRTDEM ( version 4 ) were extracted for an overlay analysis , and points with significant differences from the DEM altitude readings were removed . Almost all the glaciers in the Yigong River Basin were accumulated on top of a mountain , and the average elevation was > 4700 m ; therefore , data with values < 0 could be directly removed . In addition , the glaciers exhibited a rapid reduction in the surface elevation from the top of the mountain to the valley ; hence , the elevation near the top of the mountain was taken as the upper limit of the elevation distribution of the glaciers . In the combined use of ASTER GDEM and SRTDEM ( version 4 ) to judge the elevation anomaly , only abnormal values with a significant difference can be removed . The continuous distribution of footprints ensures that the elevation data meet the statistical law for the same satellite altimetry track . Therefore , the method of normalized density of the elevation points was used to eliminate the secondary abnormal elevation points . For each footprint , the data acquisition satisfied the normal distribution ; therefore , the normal distribution function was taken as the density distribution function of each data point , and the density curve was superimposed with the calculated mean and standard deviations . Herein , the density integral of the footprint on the same altimeter orbit was 1 . The threshold was screened from the distribution images obtained through the normalized density function , where the first trough before a significant increase in the density was the lower limit , and the first trough after a significant decrease in the density was the upper limit . 2 . 2 . Spatial matching analysis of DEM data The effective elevation interval of the two altimeter products for the Yigong River Basin could be obtained through the above two methods . Precise spatial location matching was based on the accurate calculation of the altitude difference using the DEM . In some regions , the offset of the DEM was typically calculated by arranging GPS measurement points in the field or by extracting typical points through high - precision remote sensing images [ 6 , 7 ] . Because of the difficulty in achieving field GPS validation for the Yigong River Basin , the offset of the computed ridge lines , rather than the offset of the feature points , was calculated to evaluate the accuracy of the spatial distributions obtained using ASTER GDEM and SRTM DEM [ 8 ] . First , two types of DEM ridge lines within the basin were extracted , which ensured not only the integrity of the ridge line ( SRTM DEM exhibited good data integrity ) but also the accuracy ( ASTER GDEM exhibited a high spatial resolution ) . Based on this result , the location information of 200 ridge lines ( in Figure 1 ) was randomly extracted . Subsequently , the KML files were generated and loaded using Google Earth , and the corresponding ridge position information was also extracted for spatial matching evaluation . Since Google Earth uses high - resolution WorldView - II images , a precise visual interpretation of the ridge lines could be realized . Finally , the position adjustment in the DEM was performed by calculating the offset distance between the two ridge lines . Because the ridge lines extracted from the Yigong River Basin were approximately along 30° north latitude and 93° east longitude , the relative latitude and longitude values were used to express the location of each ridge line , and the scatter diagrams could clearly reflect the migration . The latitude The Fourth International Workshop on Environment and Geoscience IOP Conf . Series : Earth and Environmental Science 865 ( 2021 ) 012036 IOP Publishing doi : 10 . 1088 / 1755 - 1315 / 865 / 1 / 012036 3 value was divided by 30 , and the longitude value was divided by 93 . All the ridge lines in the Yigong River Basin were extracted using the above method . The results in Figure 1 demonstrated a high accuracy of the SRTM DEM in terms of the spatial location matching degree for the basin , except for a few ridges lines in the southeast region . The calculations also showed that the overall deviation in the SRTM satisfied the accuracy requirement . Considering its own spatial resolution , the DEM - based calculation method proved feasible . Figure 1 . The Geometrical offset correction of SRTM in Yigong Zangbu Basin . 2 . 3 . Elevation trend simulation By extracting the elevation values of the corresponding positions in SRTM DEM using the elevation points and then calculating the height difference in each sequential track , a set of time - dependent altitude difference sequences could be obtained from the elevation points covering the glaciers . The change trend in the elevation could be obtained by linear fitting of the height difference and time . Robust regression was used to analyze the variation trend in the elevation . After the first fitting of the height difference in this method , the calculation function yielded the same weight to each fitting point , and as the number of iterations increased , the regression function reduced the weights of fitting points far from the trend line after each regression analysis . This reduced the impact of outliers on the trend results , and the iterative process was ended when the regression coefficients tended to converge [ 9 ] . The glacier elevation variation in the Yigong River Basin was fitted using the robustfit function in MATLAB with default parameters [ 10 , 11 ] . 3 . Result 3 . 1 . Filter valid data After applying a combination of the above methods to remove the elevation outliers , elevation values beyond 4681 . 38 – 5877 . 34 m and 4586 – 5944 . 97 m were considered outliers for the ICESat / GLAS1 and CryoSat - 2 / L2I products , respectively . These abnormal elevation points were accordingly filtered while retaining points statistically considered to be effective ( in Figure 2 ) . As listed in Table 1 , the quality of CryoSat - 2 data was lower than that of ICESat data . Although the number of ICESat sampling points covering the Yigong River Basin was less than that of Cryostat - 2 sampling points , the effective points accounted for 84 . 42 % of the total elevation points in the case of ICESat but only 48 . 82 % in the case of CryoSat - 2 . Overall , the valid elevation data retained by the two altimetry methods were both objective ; hence , they satisfied the measurement coverage of large mountain glaciers in the basin and are suitable for height change analyses .

Generally , glaciers are more widely distributed in the eastern and northern parts of the Yigong River Basin than in the west and south . Compared with polar regions that have a continuous form of glacier distribution , such as Greenland , most of the glaciers are in the form of separate glacier The Fourth International Workshop on Environment and Geoscience IOP Conf . Series : Earth and Environmental Science 865 ( 2021 ) 012036 IOP Publishing doi : 10 . 1088 / 1755 - 1315 / 865 / 1 / 012036 5 aggregates and are in peak areas of high - altitude mountains with small areas and large slopes , except for one particular complete glacier block . Despite ICESat and CryoSat - 2 data having a high - density data coverage on a global scale and good application in polar regions , including glacier and sea ice areas , neither the spatial distribution nor the time series of the altimeter data was ideal ( in Figure 3 ) in local areas such as the Yigong River Basin . Specifically , when there are non - glacial zones in the orbit , the high point density and time discontinuity in the orbit are low . After screening , continuous and overlapping data bands were found in the large duplex valley glaciers in the basin . These overlapping data bands in the two height measuring products were used to extract and analyze the surface elevation change in the large duplex valley glaciers . 3 . 2 . Analysis of elevation change The ICESat / GLAS altimeter has demonstrated good application in the glacial regions of the Qinghai – Tibet Plateau , and many useful scientific results have been obtained through different research methods . Currently , the most popular application of CryoSat - 2 / L2I products is the backward inference of the sea ice distribution and sea ice thickness ; however , L2I data have rarely been applied to inland glaciers . For an accurate transmission of the two altimetry data products to reflect the glacier elevation changes in the Yigong River Basin , the height difference was fitted in three segments ( e . g . , ICESat changes , CryoSat - 2 change , and overall change ) . Any unreasonable value of the height difference ( e . g . , CryoSat - 2 yielded a value as high as 10 m in 2013 ) was eliminated to ensure the validity of the trend fitting in the two types of height measurement data . The calculations showed dramatic changes in the valley glaciers in the Yigong River Basin . A comparison between Landsat images of less cloud cover in the summer of 2003 – 2015 and SAR image interference pairs in the corresponding time period showed a significant change in the glacier morphology during this period , the large duplex valley glacier exhibited an increasing tendency of splitting into small glaciers , and the continuous decrease in the glacier surface elevation was an important manifestation of glacier retreat in this basin .

Change in surface elevation of front region of Double Valley Glacier . For the largest glacier community composed of large compound duplex valley glaciers in the Yigong River Basin , the surface elevation showed a continuous retreat ( in Table 2 and Figure 4 ) , with a combined fitting correlation coefficient of 0 . 72 and a withdrawal rate of - 1 . 05 ± 0 . 53ma - 1 . The fitting results of ICESat and CryoSat - 2 segments were also significantly correlated . From the segment fitting results , the overall trend is that a relatively stable glacier form is maintained , except for the small glaciers on the edge . Hence , the elevation changes were stable , and the withdrawal rate was - 0 . 21 ± 0 . 42ma - 1 . During the 2010 – 2015 period , the glacier community was in a state of accelerated retreat , and the withdrawal rate was - 2 . 22 ± 0 . 44ma - 1 , though the elevation fluctuated significantly . 4 . Conclusion and discussion As height measurement data were used to study the surface elevation changes in the large glaciers near the Yigong River Basin ( double the ancient glacier ) , two types of laser and radar ellipsoidal system conversions were applied to the two - stage products , and the reference to the same plane effectively combined GLAS 14 and L2I data ; thus , a more continuous monitoring of the glacier elevation changes in the Yigong River Basin over the 2003 – 2015 period could be established . The overlapping GLAS 14 and L2I data in the duplex valley glacier were fitted through the iterative weighted least - squares method . The results showed that : The surface elevation change rate of the large valley glacier community in this basin during 2003 – 2008 was - 0 . 94m / yr as determined by ICESat / GLAS14 . Neckel et al . used ICESat data to extract glacier elevation changes in the entire Qinghai – Tibet Plateau from 2003 to 2009 , and found that the change rate of the glacier surface elevation in the Yigong River Basin was - 0 . 81 ± 0 . 32m / yr [ 12 ] , which is consistent with the extraction results of this study . Wu Hongbo used ICESat / GLAS and GRACE satellite data to calculate the changes in the mass balance of high Asian glaciers , with the results suggesting that the surface elevation of the glaciers in the Tanggula section and Hengduan mountains decreased 2 . 06 ± 0 . 20m and 2 . 43 ± 0 . 31m during the 2003 – 2009 period , respectively [ 13 ] , which is again consistent with our results . CryoSat - 2 / L2I data are mainly algorithm - based designed for polar sea ice and ice sheet areas , and the error threshold for inland areas is stricter , resulting in higher error values when L2I data are applied to inland area [ 14 ] . Since the CyoSat - 2 data based on SAR interferometry , the fresh snow and bare ice can seriously affect the results due to its penetration capability . The altimeter data showed that the error was significantly higher than that of ICESat , despite the strict removal of abnormal points The Fourth International Workshop on Environment and Geoscience IOP Conf . Series : Earth and Environmental Science 865 ( 2021 ) 012036 IOP Publishing doi : 10 . 1088 / 1755 - 1315 / 865 / 1 / 012036 7 and the careful calculation of the height difference . The monitored elevation change rate of the glacier in the basin during the 2003 – 2016 period was - 1 . 36m / yr . While no direct results were available for comparison and verification , the L2I elevation difference based on the baseline B can be utilized as a supplement to the GLAS data and as a reference for studying the continuous elevation changes in the basin . Notably , however , the proposed DEM spatial superposition analysis and the method of eliminating extreme values using the normalized density function are all based on the product itself , i . e . [ 15 ] , reducing the range of effective data to optimize the product and improve the accuracy of the result . In fact , there were differences in the spatial distributions of the footprints falling on the glacier , making it difficult to eliminate some of the elevation outliers . In addition , the Yigong River Basin has a variety of glaciers , including large and widely distributed complex valley glaciers as well as ice bucket glaciers and suspended glaciers with small areas and a high partition degree but in aggregation . Therefore , altimeter data can hardly be evenly distributed over the glacier surface . It is impossible to establish an even and accurate plane elevation distribution that includes all the types of glaciers ; this has a certain negative effect on the subsequent trend fitting of the glacier surface elevation differences .
