Introduction The recognition of the importance of external knowledge ﬂows is an important phenomenon seen in the organization of the inno - vation process within corporations , over the last two decades ( Rigby and Zook , 2002 ) . Firms are gradually abandoning the idea that the generation of new knowledge is mostly an internal pro - cess ( Arora et al . , 2001 ; Gans and Stern , 2003 ) . In some industries , the boundaries between the organization’s knowledge stock and external knowledge stock are blurred ( Teece , 1998 ) . Cohen and Levinthal’s seminal contribution highlights the fact that ﬁrms cannot beneﬁt from external knowledge ﬂows merely by being exposed to them ( Cohen and Levinthal , 1989 , 1990 ) . Instead , ﬁrms must develop the ability to recognize the value of new exter - nal knowledge , and then assimilate and utilize such knowledge for commercial ends ; they must develop “absorptive capacity” . Given theincreasinglysigniﬁcantroleplayedbyexternalknowledgeﬂows in recent years , absorptive capacity has gradually become a key ∗ Correspondingauthorat : DepartmentofBusinessAdministration , Universidad Carlos III de Madrid , Calle Madrid 126 , 28903 Getafe , Spain .

A ﬁrm’s absorptive capacity depends on its existing stock of knowledge , much of which is embedded in its products , processes and people . Thus , a ﬁrm’s knowledge base plays both the role of innovation and absorption ( Cohen and Levinthal , 1989 ) . This paper attempts to isolate empirically the impact of absorp - tive capacity on innovation performance . The focus is on how such an inﬂuence moderates the degree to which external knowledge ﬂows affect innovation output . Speciﬁcally , this research is cen - tered on involuntary knowledge ﬂows , arising when part of the knowledge generated by an organization spills over its bound - aries and becomes available to other organizations ( Nelson , 1959 ; Arrow , 1962 ) . We posit that , while the innovation role of a ﬁrm’s knowledge base does not necessarily depend on the amount of external knowledge , its absorption role only comes into play if external knowledge ﬂows are available . Thus , a plausible means of isolating the impact of absorptive capacity on innovation perfor - mance is to look at the moderating role played by this factor . As a further step , we explore how some key contingencies , in the exter - nal knowledge environment , inﬂuence the relationship between absorptive capacity , involuntary knowledge ﬂows and innovation performance . Inparticular , wefocusontwotypesofcontingencies : the degree of turbulence ; and the strength of intellectual property rights ( IPR ) protection . We argue that the role of absorptive capac - ity is more pronounced in environments characterized by a high degree of turbulence and tight IPR protection . Thus , we expect that the absorption role played by a ﬁrm’s knowledge base is relatively more important under such circumstances . 0048 - 7333 / $ – see front matter © 2008 Elsevier B . V .

Escribano et al . / Research Policy 38 ( 2009 ) 96 – 105 97 To perform our empirical analysis , we employ a sample of 2265 Spanishﬁrms , drawnfromtheCommunityInnovationSurveys ( CIS ) for 2000 and 2002 , administered by the Spanish National Statistics Institute . We ﬁnd evidence that a ﬁrm’s knowledge base positively moderates the impact of involuntary knowledge ﬂows on innova - tion performance ; this behavior conﬁrms the importance of the role played by absorption . Our data also suggest that the impact of absorptive capacity depends on the nature of the external knowl - edge environment , and that absorptive capacity becomes more relevant in sectors characterized by high turbulence and tight IPR protection . Our ﬁndings remain qualitatively unchanged after we control carefully for sample selection and for the potential corre - lation between external knowledge ﬂows and other variables like , for instance : absorptive capacity , innovation performance ; and the level of IPR protection . Our paper contributes to the empirical literature on absorptive capacity and its impact on different innovation outcomes . Cohen and Levinthal ( 1989 ) argue that the desire to assimilate external knowledge creates a positive incentive to invest in R & D . They ﬁnd indirect evidence of the relationship between innovation perfor - manceandabsorptivecapacitybyshowingthatexternalknowledge ﬂows encourage investment in R & D . Gambardella ( 1992 ) , after performing several case studies for large US drug manufactur - ers , concludes that ﬁrms with better in - house scientiﬁc research programs exploit outside scientiﬁc information more efﬁciently . Focusing on collaborative linkages in the biotechnology indus - try , Arora and Gambardella ( 1994 ) ﬁnd that a ﬁrm’s absorptive capacity plays a crucial role in explaining the number of alliances established by each ﬁrm . Cockburn and Henderson ( 1998 ) show that the ability to maintain close ties with the scientiﬁc com - munity is a key factor in driving a ﬁrm’s ability to recognize and use upstream research and ﬁndings . Moreover , connected - nessissigniﬁcantlycorrelatedwithperformance , indrugdiscovery . More recently , Cassiman and Veugelers ( 2006 ) show that the reliance on more basic R & D , which might proxy a ﬁrm’s absorp - tive capacity , is a contextual variable positively affecting the complementarity between internal and external innovation activ - ities . Summarizing , mostoftheexistingempiricalresearchisfocused on how absorptive capacity directly affects several dependent vari - ableslike , forinstance : performance , innovation , R & Dalliances , and technology sourcing . However , this approach does not allow us to disentangle the innovation role from the absorption role of a ﬁrm’s knowledge base . For instance , consider R & D investment . Greater R & D investment is correlated with both absorptive capacity and innovation ability ; and in turn , both capabilities affect innovation performance . Instead , byfocusingonthemoderatingroleofabsorp - tive capacity we are able to separate these two channels more convincingly . HaytonandZahra ( 2005 ) alsoattempttoseparatethe main effect ( innovation ) of a ﬁrm’s knowledge base , from its mod - erating effect ( absorption ) . Our paper extends their ﬁndings to a largersetofﬁrms , acrosstwodifferenttimespansand , mostimpor - tantly , focusesoninvoluntaryexternalknowledgeﬂowsratherthan onacquisitionsandjointventures . Aproblemthatariseswhencon - sidering acquisitions and joint ventures is that they are typically decision variables for a ﬁrm and thus might be subject to some endogeneity concerns ; this is not the case for involuntary exter - nal knowledge ﬂows . In addition , we explore the role of absorptive capacity in environments characterized by high turbulence and tough IPR protection , which – to the best of our knowledge – has not been addressed empirically before . The remainder of the paper is organized as follows . Section 2 develops the theoretical underpinnings , drawing on the related lit - eratureoninvoluntaryknowledgeﬂowsandabsorptivecapacity . In Section 3 , we conduct the empirical analysis . The paper ends with some ﬁnal remarks and a discussion of policy as well as managerial implications . 2 . Background theory : innovation , external knowledge ﬂows and absorptive capacity Innovation is a complex activity in which new knowledge is appliedforcommercialends . Newknowledgeisgeneratedthrough a cumulative process in which knowledge is added , deleted , trans - formed , modiﬁed or simply reinterpreted . Part of this knowledge reaches the ﬁrm from external sources ( Cassiman and Veugelers , 2002 ) , whicharerecognizedasapivotalelementinthesuccessofa ﬁrm’s innovation activity ( Rosenberg , 1982 ) . Inward looking ﬁrms have been accused of suffering from the so - called “Not invented here” syndrome ( Katz and Allen , 1982 ) . However , the importance of knowledge generated outside a ﬁrm’s boundaries has increased dramatically over the last few years ( see the opening quotation ) . The greater availability of external knowledge does not imply that ﬁrms can now rely simply on outside knowledge ﬂows . In fact , mereexposuretoexternalknowledgeisnotsufﬁcienttointer - nalize it successfully . As discussed in the introduction , Cohen and Levinthal ( 1990 ) highlightthekeyroleplayedby“absorptivecapac - ity” . Absorptive capacity is deﬁned as the ability to recognize the value of external knowledge , assimilate it , and apply it to commer - cial ends . Involuntary external knowledge ﬂows constitute a prototypical example of external knowledge sources that a ﬁrm can poten - tially exploit to enhance innovation performance . 1 The concept was pioneered by Nelson ( 1959 ) and Arrow ( 1962 ) who character - ized knowledge as having the features of a durable public good . The knowledge produced by an innovator is easily “borrowed” by another party that has no intention of compensating the for - mer . Several authors have documented the importance of external knowledge ﬂows as an aid to strategic decision - making at the ﬁrm level ( Jaffe , 1986 ; Cohen and Levinthal , 1989 ; Cassiman and Veugelers , 2002 ) . The external knowledge base available to a ﬁrm depends among other factors on : the density of ﬁrms clustered in a given geographical area ; sector of activity ; social ties ; nature of the knowledge ; and the level of IPR ( Jaffe et al . , 1993 ; Teece , 1986 ; Saxenian , 1994 ) . Someauthorsstressthelocalizednatureofknowl - edge ﬂows , because ideas circulate easily from one ﬁrm to another , as a result of geographical and social proximity ( Saxenian , 1994 ; Audretsch and Feldman , 1996 ; Fosfuri et al . , 2001 ) . Others , instead , questionthecommonpresumptionofacloserelationshipbetween functional , relational and geographical proximity , and argue that there is no reason why such a learning process should be limited territorially ( Amin and Cohendet , 2004 ; Giuliani and Bell , 2005 ) . Whether or not knowledge ﬂows are localized geographically , ﬁrms exposed to the same amount of external knowledge ﬂows might not derive equal beneﬁts , because they differ in their abil - ity to identify and exploit such ﬂows ( Beaudry and Breschi , 2003 ; Giuliani and Bell , 2005 ) . Thus , both the amount and effect of externalknowledgeﬂowsareunequallydistributedacrossthepop - ulationofﬁrms . Inotherwords , absorptivecapacitycanbeasource of a ﬁrm’s competitive advantage . A ﬁrm’s absorptive capacity depends on its existing knowledge stock , much of which is embedded in its products , processes and people . Thus , a ﬁrm’s knowledge base plays both the role of inno - 1 Involuntary external knowledge ﬂows are sometimes referred as knowledge spillovers . For instance , Cassiman and Veugelers ( 2002 ) argue that knowledge spillovers might play a dual role . Incoming knowledge spillovers might be beneﬁ - cial , whereasoutgoingknowledgespilloversmightbeneﬁtcompetitorsandthereby reduce a ﬁrm’s competitive advantage in innovation . 98 A . Escribano et al . / Research Policy 38 ( 2009 ) 96 – 105 vation and that of absorption ( Cohen and Levinthal , 1989 ) . Put differently , the drivers of absorptive capacity are highly correlated withtheinputsfromtheinnovationprocessaswellasaﬁrm’sinno - vation ability , and it is not easy to estimate their individual effect on innovation performance . For instance , R & D employees , without any publications in scientiﬁc journals , may ignore the existence of such specialized journals where a great deal of publicly available knowledge can be sourced . On the other hand , the fact that these scientists have never managed to publish might also be a warning oflowqualityinputsintotheinnovationprocessthathighlightsthe inability to innovate . We adopt the following approach in order to address these subtleties . We posit that absorptive capacity has an impact on innovation performance only when there are external knowl - edge ﬂows that can be identiﬁed , integrated and , thereafter , exploited . Put differently , a ﬁrm that lives in a vacuum would not derive any beneﬁt from absorptive capacity . By contrast , innovation capabilities , per se , do generate innovation outcomes irrespective of the presence of external knowledge ﬂows . Hence , the way to isolate the role of absorptive capacity is by study - ing its moderating effect on the impact of external knowledge ﬂows on innovation performance . Firms with greater absorptive capacity beneﬁt more from the presence of external knowledge ﬂows . As mentioned before , many of the drivers of innova - tion performance are also drivers of a ﬁrm’s absorptive capacity . Thus , it would be difﬁcult to isolate the impact of absorp - tive capacity on innovation performance , if one had posited a direct effect . In such a case , the only available option is to impose ex - ante a different set of proxies that explain absorp - tive capacity . We believe that absorption and innovation are so intertwined that it would be meaningless to proceed down this path . Note that the literature suggests two separate roles played by absorptivecapacitywithrespecttoexternalknowledge ( Cohenand Levinthal , 1989 ; Arora and Gambardella , 1994 ; Zahra and George , 2002 ) . First , absorptive capacity helps the ﬁrm to identify more available knowledge ﬂows . In other words , the amount of exter - nal knowledge that the ﬁrm perceives is an increasing function of its absorptive capacity . Second , for a given quantity of identiﬁed external knowledge ﬂows , the degree by which the ﬁrm derives beneﬁts also depends on its absorptive capacity . The former effect is what other scholars refer to as : ability to identify , ability to eval - uate ; or potential absorptive capacity ; the latter effect is labeled typically as : ability to use ; ability to exploit ; or realized absorptive capacity . Overall , wecanconcludethatheterogeneityinthelevelof absorptive capacity translates into differences in the beneﬁts from otherwise similar stocks of external knowledge both because the ﬁrm can identify more of them and because it can exploit them more efﬁciently . H1 . A ﬁrm’s absorptive capacity moderates positively the impact of involuntary external knowledge ﬂows on innovation performance . The relationship between absorptive capacity , external knowl - edge ﬂows and innovation performance depends crucially on some key contingencies in the external knowledge environment , thus , making absorptive capacity a more or a less critical , strategic dimension . We focus here on two contingencies : the degree of tur - bulence and the level of legal appropriability . We argue below that theroleofabsorptivecapacityismorepronouncedinenvironments characterized by high degree of turbulence and tough IPR protec - tion . We expect the absorption role of a ﬁrm’s knowledge base to be relatively more important in such environments , thus making it easier for us to isolate its impact empirically . This effect further validates our moderating approach to measure the importance of a ﬁrm’s absorptive capacity . 2 . 1 . Turbulent knowledge environments Althoughoutsideknowledgeiscriticaltotheinnovationprocess ingeneral , itbecomesevenmoreimportantinthecontextofchang - ingknowledgeenvironments ( Ilinitchetal . , 1996 ) . Firmscompeting in such environments need to reconﬁgure their knowledge bases if theywanttosurvive ( BarnettandSorenson , 2002 ) . Akeydifference between stable and turbulent knowledge environments depends on the relative importance of explorative and exploitative learn - ing processes ( March , 1991 ) . Exploration implies search , discovery , experimentation , risk taking and innovation ; while exploitation implies reﬁnement , implementation , efﬁciency of production and selection ( Levinthal and March , 1993 ) . In stable knowledge envi - ronments , ﬁrms place a strong emphasis on exploiting knowledge , since the knowledge domain that they wish to utilize is closely related to their current knowledge base . On the contrary , in turbu - lent knowledge environments , ﬁrms are more active in exploration since the relevant knowledge might be far removed from their existing knowledge stock ( Van den Bosch et al . , 1999 ) . The role played by outside knowledge is rather different across these two activities . While local search processes that characterize exploitationmightnotneedexternalfeedback , explorationactivity more heavily relies on outside knowledge for idea generating , fun - damental understanding of the phenomena , basic knowledge and marketresponse ( RosenkopfandNerkar , 2001 ) . Hence , inturbulent knowledge environments , the emphasis is on monitoring external knowledge development and an inward looking attitude would be penalized strongly . In turn , this behavior implies that absorptive capacity plays a more important role in turbulent knowledge envi - ronments . Because a great deal of the relevant knowledge required forinnovationactivityisfoundoutsideaﬁrm’sboundaries , external knowledge ﬂows become more important ; and the ability to ben - eﬁt from these ﬂows plays a crucial role in securing competitive advantage . H2 . In turbulent knowledge environments , the moderating role of absorptive capacity becomes relatively more important . 2 . 2 . The degree of legal appropriability Anotherimportantcharacteristicoftheknowledgeenvironment is the strength of the appropriability regime . Appropriability refers to the ﬁrm’s ability to protect the advantages of ( and beneﬁt from ) new products or processes ( Teece , 1986 ) . Appropriability depends , among other things , on the levels of legal protection for IPR . Under a strong protection regime , ﬁrms patent their intellectual property to protect revenue streams arising from innovations . Imitation is more difﬁcult and valid patents constitute an important source of a ﬁrm’s sustainable competitive advantage . One of the patent system’s principal tasks is related to the dis - closure of information that can be socially and efﬁciently used by otherplayers . Iftheprotectionregimeisstrong , ﬁrmstendtopatent extensively , thereby contributing to generate comprehensive and accessiblesourcesofhigh - qualityscientiﬁcandtechnologicalinfor - mation ( Granstrand , 1999 ) . 2 However , patenting is a risky strategy when the protection regime is weak . Indeed , a patent may provide enabling information for other ﬁrms and yet offer little guaran - tee to the innovating ﬁrm that holds the patent . This implies , ﬁrst , that ﬁrms have fewer incentives to undertake costly and complex innovative projects which could then generate knowledge ﬂows . 2 For instance , Arora et al . ( 2008 ) show empirically that a ﬁrm’s propensity to patent and the patent premium ( i . e . the extra proﬁt that a patent confers to an innovation ) are positively correlated . A . Escribano et al . / Research Policy 38 ( 2009 ) 96 – 105 99 Second , ﬁrms will develop mechanisms to protect their innova - tion by reducing the amount of information disclosed . Cohen et al . ( 2000 ) ﬁnd , after an extensive survey of manufacturing ﬁrms , that secrecy is the preferred mode of protecting both product and process innovations . Thus , the amount and quality of exter - nal knowledge ﬂows is greater in environments characterized by strong legal appropriability . In addition , under a tight protection regime , ﬁrms can only use outside information if they are able to transform and mod - ify it in such a way that the new knowledge does not infringe the patented knowledge , for instance , by inventing around the patent . This knowledge transformation capability is a critical com - ponent of a ﬁrm’s absorptive capacity . By contrast , under a regime of weak IPR protection , imitation is widespread . Imitating ﬁrms do notneedtotransformtheknowledgebutcanuseitasitis . Thus , the exploitation of external knowledge ﬂows does not require the ﬁrm toundertakethecomplexanddemandingtaskofknowledgetrans - formation ( ZahraandGeorge , 2002 ) . Whilecompetitiveﬁrmsmust keep innovating so as to stay ahead of rivals , absorptive capacity has less impact when IPR protection is weak ( Spence , 1984 ) . H3 . In environments with strong IPR protection , the moderating role of absorptive capacity becomes relatively more important . 3 . Empirical analysis 3 . 1 . Data ThedatasetusedinthisstudyisassembledfromtheCommunity Innovation Survey conducted in Spain , in 2000 , and administered by the Spanish National Statistics Institute ( INE ) , together with a fully comparable survey conducted by the same Institute in 2002 ( Encuesta de Innovación Tecnológica , EIT ) . The survey collects detailed information about innovation activities for Spanish ﬁrms belonging to all sectors of the economy . The database for each year is composed of a stratiﬁed sample , according to the number of employees and sector . In particular , the number of employees is divided into three intervals ( from 10 to 49 ; from 50 to 249 ; and morethan250 ) . INEonlysentthequestionnairetoﬁrmswithmore than10employees . Firmsareassignedto55different2 - digitsectors ( groupedin10broad1 - digitsectors ) , followingaSpanishclassiﬁca - tion named CNAE that is equivalent to the 2 - digit SIC classiﬁcation . Questionnaires were sent to the CEOs . The response rate was very good ( 92 % ) . This is not surprising given that Spanish ﬁrms have a legal obligation to ﬁll in questionnaires originating from INE . The ﬁnaldatabase , afterremovingobservationswithmissingvalues , isa panel of about 4000 ﬁrms that have answered the questionnaire in both periods . Some diagnostic checks are performed to ensure that thesampledoesnotsufferanyseriousselectionbias . 3 Slightlymore than 55 % of the ﬁrms in our sample indicate that they have spent a positive amount of resources on innovation activities . We think that this subject is irrelevant for those ﬁrms that have not devoted resources to innovation activities . However , as discussed later , we alsoestimateaHeckman’stwo - stageselectionmodel , usingthefull sample , in order to prevent a possible sample selection bias . 3 . 2 . Variable deﬁnition 3 . 2 . 1 . Innovation performance . We look at two different measures of innovation performance . NewProd is the percentage of total annual sales ( for the year 2002 ) 3 Speciﬁcally , we have checked that the records we removed for missing values werenotdifferentinsomeobservabledimensionsfromthesampleweﬁnallyused . thatcomprisesneworsubstantiallyimprovedproductsintroduced over the period 2000 – 2002 . The natural log is used to compen - sate for skewness . 4 Innov is a dummy that equals 1 if the ﬁrm has introduced a product or a process innovation during the period 2000 – 2002 and 0 otherwise . 3 . 2 . 2 . External knowledge ﬂows Inthequestionnaire , ﬁrmsratetheimportanceofdifferentinfor - mation sources as a catalyst for innovation , on a four - point scale from 1 ( high ) to 4 ( not at all ) . We focus on 7 sources : suppliers , clients , competitors , universities , other research institutions , spe - cializedjournalsandmeetings . 5 Webuildanindex ( ExtKnow ﬂows ) bycomputingtheprincipalcomponentofthevariablesthatcapture the role of the aforementioned sources of external knowledge . 6 3 . 2 . 3 . Absorptive capacity Theliteratureproposesseveraldifferentmeasuresofabsorptive capacity , and no single one is superior to all others , under all cir - cumstances . Cohen and Levinthal ( 1989 , 1990 ) use R & D intensity , although the process of building absorptive capacity is inher - ently cumulative . 7 Veugelers ( 1997 ) and Cassiman and Veugelers ( 2002 ) , among others , use the fact that the ﬁrm has a fully staffed R & D department to capture such cumulativeness . Finally , since absorptive capacity is related to the ability of individuals in the organization to assimilate , then process and transform external knowledgeﬂows ; scholarsalsousemeasuresofaﬁrm’shumancap - ital . For instance , as such a measure , Mowery and Oxley ( 1995 ) and Keller ( 1996 ) employ investment in scientiﬁc and technical train - ingandthenumberofscientistsandengineers . Similarly , Veugelers ( 1997 ) uses the number of doctorates within the R & D department . Following the different suggestions in the literature , we opera - tionalize our measure of absorptive capacity by constructing an indicator , AbsCap , whichistheprincipalcomponentof : ( 1 ) theinter - nal R & D expenses ( Internal R & D ) ; ( 2 ) a dummy which is equal to 1 iftheﬁrmhasafullystaffedR & Ddepartment ( Permanent R & D ) ; ( 3 ) a dummy that is equal to 1 if the ﬁrm provides training for its R & D personnel ( Training ) ; and ( 4 ) the ratio of scientists and researchers to total employees ( R & D Skills ) . 3 . 2 . 4 . Inputs of the innovation process Wetryandcontrolasmuchaspossibleforotherpossibledrivers forinnovationperformance . Aswediscussedbefore , aﬁrm’sknowl - edge base plays the role of both innovation and absorption . Thus , for inputs of the innovation process , we use exactly the same vari - ables that enter in our measure of absorptive capacity , that is , Internal R & D , Permanent R & D , Training , and R & D Skills . In order to capture empirically the moderating role of absorptive capacity , we crossourindicatorofaﬁrm’sabsorptivecapacitywithourmeasure ofexternalknowledgeﬂows ( AbsCap × ExtKnow Flows ) . Inaddition , we also control for a direct effect of external knowledge ﬂows on innovation performance . 4 To avoid dropping observations with zero values we deﬁne the transformed variable as log ( 1 + NewProd ) . Although not reported , we also conduct estimations using Pakes ( 1985 ) correction . Results remain unchanged qualitatively . 5 CassimanandVeugelers ( 2002 ) , intheirstudyofR & Dcooperationandspillovers , discuss the virtues of a measure of knowledge spillovers based on the importance of different information sources for innovation vis - à - vis alternative measures pro - posed in the literature . 6 As a robustness check , we also use , in unreported estimations ( available upon request ) , a measure based on the normalized sum of the 7 variables , capturing the aforementioned sources of external knowledge . Results remain unchanged in qualitative terms . 7 Nesta and Saviotti ( 2005 ) show that the successful integration of external and internal knowledge occurs when ﬁrms base their research activities on distinctive competencies developed across time . 100 A .

Turbulent knowledge sectors Turbulentknowledgeenvironmentsarethosewheretheunder - lyingknowledgebaseissubjecttoaprocessofcontinuousevolution and change . By identifying the degree of knowledge turbulence at thesectorlevel , weattempttoaddressthefactthatsomeindustries may experience greater technological ferment which , in turn , may drive both the importance of absorptive capacity and the oppor - tunities to beneﬁt from external knowledge ﬂows . We reﬂect the “turbulentnature”ofasectorbyemployingavariablethatisthedif - ferencebetweenthesectorgrowthrate , insalesofneworimproved products , andtheaveragegrowthratecomputedacrossallavailable sectors ( Turbulent ) . In order to contrast H2 , we construct a three - term interaction variable ( Turbulent × AbsCap × ExtKnow Flows ) . Also , so as to test correctly for the existence of a positive moderating role played by absorptive capacity in turbulent sectors , we incorporate the two - term interaction variables ( AbsCap × ExtKnow Flows , Turbu - lent × ExtKnow Flows ) and the direct effect ( Turbulent ) , into the speciﬁcations . 8 3 . 2 . 6 . Sectors with tight IPR protection Firms rate , on a four - point scale , the effectiveness of four dif - ferent legal methods for IPR protection : patents , utility models , trademarks and copyrights . We sum up the four scores , and stan - dardize such that the resulting index varies between 0 ( minimum protection ) and 1 ( maximum protection ) . Finally , we average the ﬁrm level index at the sector level . 9 The literature shows that there are important differences across sectors in the role played by IPR . The difference between this average and mean value of the sample ( economy average ) is our proxy for the degree of appropriability ( Appropriability ) . Finally , in order to contrast H3 , as in the analysis for tur - bulent sectors , we construct a three - term interaction variable ( Appropriability × AbsCap × ExtKnow Flows ) . Also , we include the two - terminteractionvariables ( AbsCap × ExtKnow Flows , Appropri - ability × ExtKnow Flows ) and the direct effect ( Appropriability ) . 10 3 . 2 . 7 . Control variables We use the number of employees on a log scale ( Size ) as a measure of a ﬁrm’s size . We control for size because previous researchhasfoundthatinnovationperformancemightbeneﬁtfrom economiesofscaleandscope ( CockburnandHenderson , 1994 ) . We use a dummy ( New ) that signals whether or not a ﬁrm is of new creation . Indeed , several authors suggest that new ventures might have stronger incentives to innovate under certain technological regimes . We also control for the existence of factors that hinder innovation performance ( InnObstacles ) . Firms rate , on a four - point scale , the impact of the following obstacles on innovation activity : ( a ) excessive risk ; ( b ) large sunk investment ; and ( c ) short pocket .

Finally , in order to control for sector and location - speciﬁc sources of hetero - geneity in innovation performance , we introduce a set of dummies for our ten 1 - digit sectors and a set of dummies for the 17 main Spanish regions .

Table 2 shows that those ﬁrms with a level of absorptive capac - ity in the upper third of the distribution , display higher innovation performance than those in the lower third of the distribution ( the difference in the conditional mean value of NewProd is 1 . 22 ) . A . Escribanoetal . / ResearchPolicy38 ( 2009 ) 96 – 105 101 Table2 Descriptive statistics of the main variables . The table presents the descriptive statistics for the variables that we use in the econometric analysis . The variables are deﬁned in Table 1 . In column 2 , the statistics are from ﬁrms with an absorptive capacity in the upper third of the distribution ( AC = 1 ) , while those of column 3 correspond to the lower third of the distribution ( AC = 0 ) . The statistics in columns 4 and 5 are similar to those in columns 2 and 3 , but focused on ﬁrms in more turbulent sectors ( sectors with Turbulent > 0 ) . Finally , the last two columns follow the same logic as columns 2 and 3 but focus on ﬁrms that operate in sectors with stronger IPR ( sectors with Appropriability > 0 ) .

Interestingly , this difference is higher when we focus on ﬁrms that belong to more turbulent sectors ( 1 . 33 ) or to sectors with stronger IPR ( 1 . 34 ) . Thus , it seems that the role of absorptive capacity in innovation performance is particularly important in turbulent sectors and sectors with tight legal appropriability . A second result that can be extracted from this table is that , those ﬁrms with a level of absorptive capacity in the upper third of the distribution , report higher external knowledge ﬂows than those in the lower third of the distribution ( difference = 0 . 15 ) . This difference is larger when we focus on more turbulent sectors ( dif - ference = 0 . 18 ) or on sectors with stronger IPR ( difference = 0 . 18 ) . Hence , we see that absorptive capacity and external knowledge ﬂows are positively correlated and , in turn , both are positively relatedtoinnovationperformance . Theeconometricanalysisbelow explores these relationships in greater depth . 3 . 3 . Econometric analysis Our unit of observation is the ﬁrm . We hypothesize that innova - tion performance is generated by the function y t + 1 = f ( x t , ˇ ) , where y t + 1 is either the log of the percentage of total annual sales that consist of new or substantially improved products ( NewProd ) ; or a dummy ( Innov ) thatequals1iftheﬁrmhasintroducedaproductor a process innovation ; and 0 otherwise ; x t is the set of explanatory variables described above , including our measures for absorptive capacity and external knowledge ﬂows ; and ˇ is a vector of param - eters to be estimated . We estimate the NewProd equation by using least squares ( OLS ) with robust standard errors , and in order to make coefﬁcients comparable across different estimations , we enter all variables in standardized form . This does not alter the signiﬁcance of the coef - ﬁcients ; the t - values remain unchanged . In addition , in order to reduce multicollinearity concerns that may be particularly prob - lematic in the estimations which include interaction terms , we orthogonalize such interaction - term variables . 11 Finally , we esti - mate the Innov equation using a Logit model . 11 Wecomputethevarianceinﬂationfactorsinallestimationsandthemaximum value for the interactive terms is lower than 4 in all cases ; thus , well below the thresholdvalueof20thatitisindicativeofmulticollinearityproblems . One must bear in mind that , while our innovation performance measures ( dependent variables in the estimations ) are drawn from the 2002 survey , all explanatory variables come from the 2000 survey . Thistimelaghelpsustoreducepotentialendogeneityprob - lems caused by simultaneity between innovation performance and the variables capturing external knowledge ﬂows and absorptive capacity . The estimation results are shown in Table 3 . As mentioned before , here we only focus on those ﬁrms that have invested a positive amount of resources in innovation activity . First of all , one should note that external knowledge ﬂows have a positive and signiﬁcant impact on innovation performance ; ﬁrms that enjoy more external knowledge ﬂows are more inno - vative . Second , ﬁrms with higher levels of absorptive capacity beneﬁt more from external knowledge ﬂows . Indeed , our cross variable ( AbsCap × ExtKnow Flows ) is positive and highly signif - icant . Hence , one can conclude that , other things being equal , external knowledge ﬂows have a direct and positive impact on innovation performance , and that the magnitude of this effect depends very much on a ﬁrm’s absorptive capacity . Put differ - ently , ﬁrms with higher levels of absorptive capacity are more innovative because they exploit external knowledge ﬂows more efﬁciently . The signs for the other variables seem plausible . Larger investments in R & D ( both ﬂow and cumulative ) generate bet - ter innovation performance . Other measures of innovation inputs , Training and R & D Skills , particularly the latter , bring up signiﬁ - cant positive coefﬁcients . Strategic protection and a ﬁrm’s size are related , both positively and signiﬁcantly , to innovation perfor - mance . Finally , start - up ﬁrms do not enjoy any advantage related to innovation activity vis - à - vis more established rivals . 12 As a second objective of this study , we would like to investigate if the importance of absorptive capacity depends on the contin - gencies of the knowledge environment . We argue that absorptive 12 For the sake of completeness , we re - estimate the speciﬁcations of Table 3 dis - tinguishing between small , medium and large ﬁrms . ( Small : a ﬁrm with less than 50 employees . Medium : between 50 and 250 employees . Large : more than 250 employees . ) The results are qualitatively similar across the different categories of ﬁrmsize . 102 A .

Table 4 addresses this issue speciﬁcally . As discussed before , in order to contrast our conjectures , we add three additional vari - ables to our previous list of regressors ( see Table 4 ) . The coefﬁcient of the variable Turbulent × AbsCap × ExtKnow Flows is positive and signiﬁcant at the 1 % level ( see columns 1 and 2 ) , meaning that absorptive capacity plays an important role in turning external knowledge ﬂows into innovative products in those sectors with a more turbulent knowledge environment .

Interaction effects of absorptive capacity and knowledge ﬂows : comparison between sectors with high appropriability and those with low appropriability . the conversion of external knowledge ﬂows into innovative prod - ucts , in those sectors with stricter legal enforcement of IPR . To give a sense of the strength of the effects found , we con - duct simulations using the speciﬁcations of Table 4 ( columns 1 and 3 ) . Fig . 1 plots the share of sales attributed to new and improved products , as a function of external knowledge ﬂows , by holding all other variables at their median values , except for abscap that is ﬁxed either at the mean value or at the upper quartile of the dis - tribution . Fig . 1 shows four curves : two of them focus on turbulent sectors ( Turbulent > 0 ) ; and the other two on non - turbulent ones ( Turbulent ≤ 0 ) . We ﬁnd that the positive effect of external knowl - edge ﬂows on the share of sales , due to new or improved products ( NewProd ) , is more pronounced when absorptive capacity grows from the median to the upper quartile . Remarkably , this increase is largerforturbulentsectors . Forexample , whenexternalknowledge ﬂows take their maximum value ( i . e . 1 ) , the increases in NewProd , as absorptive capacity moves from the median to the upper quar - tile are 22 % for turbulent sectors and 17 . 8 % for non - turbulent ones . This difference increases with the amount of external knowledge ﬂows , as Fig . 1 shows and , obviously , disappears when knowledge ﬂows are equal to zero . Fig . 2 is similar to Fig . 1 , except that it compares sectors with strong ( Appropriability > 0 ) and weak legal appropriability ( Appro - priability ≤ 0 ) . Theresultsshowthatthepositivemoderatingroleof absorptive capacity is greater for the former sectors . For example , when external knowledge ﬂows take their maximum value ( i . e . 1 ) , the increase in NewProd as absorptive capacity moves from the median to the upper quartile is 6 % , in sectors with strong legal appropriability ; and only 3 % , in sectors with weak legal appropri - ability . 3 . 4 . Robustness checks We discuss some of the econometric checks that we carry out , in order to test the robustness of our ﬁndings . First , in our regressions ( see Tables 3 and 4 ) , we focus only on those ﬁrms that have expended a positive amount of resources on innovationactivity . Sinceweselectoursamplebasedonathreshold ( i . e . whether or not ﬁrms spend resources on innovation activity ) , our results could suffer from some sort of selection bias . In order to tacklethisproblem , werunaHeckman’stwo - stageselectionmodel where , in the ﬁrst stage , the inverse Mills ratio is obtained from a Logitregression ( topredictwhetherornotaﬁrmexpendsresources on innovation activity ) using all available observations . 13 For the secondstage , theinverseMillratioisincluded , asanadditionalvari - able , so as to explain the variation in innovation performance . We have a total of 3986 ﬁrms of which 2265 spend resources on inno - 13 The speciﬁcation used to predict this probability includes the following vari - ables ( for deﬁnitions see Table 1 ) : Abscap , StrategicProtection , InnObstacles , Size , New , andsectorandregionaldummies . Additionally , foridentiﬁcationpurposeswe introduce controls for total export activity and total investment . vationactivity . TheMillratioturnsouttobeinsigniﬁcantatthe10 % level in almost all speciﬁcations except in one that it is signiﬁcant at 10 % , suggesting that the sample selection bias is not a serious issue here . The results are available from the authors upon request . A second concern arises from the measure of external knowl - edge ﬂows that we employ . In the questionnaire , ﬁrms rate the importance of different external sources of information based on their positive impact on innovation activity . We exploit these answers to build a ﬁrm - speciﬁc index of external knowledge ﬂows . Such an index accounts for the fact that not all ﬁrms are exposed to thesameamountofexternalknowledgeﬂows , eveniftheycompete in the same sector or geographical area ( Giuliani and Bell , 2005 ) . However , this measure is likely to be a function the ﬁrm’s ability to identify and recognize external knowledge ﬂows , namely , absorp - tivecapacity . Indeed , ifaﬁrmcannotidentifythepresenceofuseful external information it would tend to classify such information as unimportant . Moreover , inordertocarryoutanyclassiﬁcation , one hastohavetheabilitytostudytheitemunderscrutinyandcompare it with some reference object ( March , 1991 ; Levinthal and March , 1993 ) . Hence , such a ﬁrm - speciﬁc measure of external knowledge ﬂows is likely to be positively correlated to a ﬁrm’s level of absorp - tive capacity . ( This is in fact the case , as Table 2 shows . ) A third concern , which is related to the previous one , refers to the possible correlation between our measure of external knowl - edge ﬂows and the degree of appropriability . As we discuss in the theory section , the amount of external knowledge ﬂows might be closely related to the legal mechanisms that govern appropriability ( patents , trademarks , etc . ) . Although appropriability is measured at the sector level and external knowledge ﬂows are ﬁrm - speciﬁc , some confounding effects could still be present . A fourth concern is the possibility that our measure of external knowledge ﬂows is correlated with the dependent variable ( recall , however , that the latter is led by one period ) . This may occur when there is sufﬁcient persistence in innovation performance ; when those ﬁrms that have innovated successfully in period t , are also successful in period t + 1 . 14 Hence , the drivers of innovation perfor - mancemayalsoimpactaﬁrm’sratingoftheimportanceofexternal knowledge ﬂows . In order to address the last three concerns simultaneously , we runa2SLSestimation , whereweuse , asaninstrument , acorrection of the predicted value of external knowledge ﬂows obtained from a speciﬁcation that estimates external knowledge ﬂows as a func - tion of : AbsCap , Appropriability and NewProd and the dummies for 1 - digit sectors and regions . The results from such a regression ( not reported here ) , show that AbsCap , Appropriability and NewProd all have positive , substantial effect ( 1 % signiﬁcant ) on external knowl - edge ﬂows . The coefﬁcients are used to construct our instrument of external knowledge ﬂows ( Inst [ ExtKnow Flows ] ) , that is : Inst [ ExtKnow Flows ] it = ExtKnow Flows it − ( ˇ 1 AbsCap it + ˇ 2 Appropriability it + ˇ 3 NewProd it ) , where ˇ 1 = 0 . 1 ; ˇ 2 = 0 . 048 ; ˇ 3 = 0 . 05 are the coefﬁcients estimated from the equation driving external knowledge ﬂows described above . 15 Table 5 conﬁrms our main empirical ﬁndings , that is , absorptive capacity positively moderates the impact of external knowledge ﬂows on innovation performance , particularly in tur - bulent sectors and in those sectors with strong appropriability . 14 We make the point that if ExtKnow Flows t is correlated with the error term of NewProd t ( Innov t ) , it may also be correlated with the error term of NewProd t + 1 ( Innov t + 1 ) . This may occur when the error term has a ﬁrm - speciﬁc component . 15 The 2SLS only applies for the estimation of NewProd . In the Logit estimations of Innov , following Wooldridge ( 2001 ) we introduce directly the instrument in the speciﬁcations , in order to deal with the endogeneity problem . 104 A .

In addition , we experiment with several other control variables like , for instance : export intensity ; a dummy for multinational ﬁrms ; provincial instead of regional dummies ; 2 - digit sector dummies ; and a Herﬁndahl index to control for the degree of competition . The results do not change . Finally , since we have a samplewithveryheterogeneousﬁrms – somewithfewemployees , and others , large multinational corporations – there are sizable differences between mean and median values for several variables . This could suggest the presence of a signiﬁcant amount of outliers and , in turn , potential problems in the estimations . So as to control for the effect of these outliers , we re - estimate our speciﬁcations using the correction introduced by Huber ( 1964 ) . The results – available upon request – do not change qualitatively and are even stronger in comparison with those in Tables 3 and 4 . 4 . Conclusions Cohen and Levinthal ( 1989 ) opened up a research agenda by deﬁning the concept of absorptive capacity and emphasizing its inﬂuence on a ﬁrm’s ability to innovate . However , they also point out that absorptive capacity impinges on a ﬁrm’s knowledge base , and that it is difﬁcult to separate absorption and innovation empir - ically . This paper looks at the moderating role played by absorptive capacity , as an avenue to measure its impact on innovation per - formance . We argue that ﬁrms endowed with more absorptive capacity are better equipped to identify the presence of external knowledge ﬂows and , more importantly , exploit them efﬁciently . Our results suggest that absorptive capacity is indeed a source of competitive advantage . In other words , this paper shows that it pays dividends , in terms of innovation performance , to invest in enhancing absorptive capacity . Moreover , we ﬁnd that absorptive capacity plays an even more critical role in turbulent knowledge sectors and sectors with tighter IPR . In the knowledge - based economy , where a large proportion of relevant knowledge resides outside a ﬁrm’s boundaries , this is a particularly important message for managers who aim to develop sustainable competitive advantage ( Arora et al . , 2001 ) . The greater availability of external knowledge , both in terms of voluntary and involuntary knowledge ﬂows , could suggest that internal innova - tion becomes relatively less important . Although logically correct , this statement underestimates the importance of a ﬁrm’s knowl - edge base in developing absorptive capacity . Internal investment in innovation is , thus , even more important because it enhances a ﬁrm’s capacity to absorb external knowledge . This research also offers some policy implications . First , by assessing how absorptive capacity affects innovation performance , it proposes a different channel for government policies that foster innovation . Since there is a link between ﬁrms’ absorptive capac - ity and a country’s absorptive capacity ( George and Prabhu , 2003 ) , thenapolicyaimedatstimulatingﬁrms’absorptivecapacitymight be very effective in making the country more receptive to interna - tional knowledge ﬂows . These ﬂows end up stimulating local inno - vationaswell . Second , ourresultssuggestthatalthoughknowledge circulates more easily in industrial clusters or geographically agglomerated industries , the degree to which ﬁrms beneﬁt from belonging to clusters is not evenly spread ( Beaudry and Breschi , 2003 ; Giuliani and Bell , 2005 ) . Absorptive capacity plays a crucial role . Thus , governments that are intent on fostering the creation of industrialclustersmustalsoestablishcomplementarypoliciessoas toenhanceﬁrms’absorptivecapacity . Finally , ourﬁndingshighlight that absorptive capacity is relatively more important in turbulent knowledgeenvironmentsandwhenIPRprotectionisstronger . Gov - ernments set on formulating policies to foster ﬁrms’ absorptive capacity would be well advised to do so in high tech sectors , in conjunction with initiatives aimed at increasing IPR protection . This study is subject to a number of limitations and some of them are natural avenues for future research . First , most of our data were self - reported assessments from ﬁrms’ CEOs . Although INE takes appropriate steps , both in the design and testing phases , to limit concerns regarding single - informant data , the issues of A . Escribano et al . / Research Policy 38 ( 2009 ) 96 – 105 105 key informant bias and common method bias cannot be ruled out conclusively . Second , our research is conducted using a sample of Spanish ﬁrms . We do not have any speciﬁc reason to believe that nationality might bias our results in a speciﬁc direction . Fortu - nately , we can test this easily , in future research , because the very same dataset that we use for Spanish ﬁrms is available for many other European countries ( the so - called “Community Innovation Survey” ) . Third , we are forced to be eclectic when measuring some of our variables and constructs . Although we use survey data , we did not participate in the development of the questionnaire , nor was it structured to answer the research questions addressed in this paper . In particular , we have no direct measure for absorptive capacity . However , we exploit the existing literature to provide a plausible proxy that uses several components of a ﬁrm’s knowl - edge base . Finally , it may be worth studying , in more depth , the dynamics that link a ﬁrm’s absorptive capacity to innovation per - formance . This would require the expansion of our panel data to include more periods . This limitation is likely to be solved in the near future . Indeed , a new wave of data will be available soon , and there is a strong commitment by INE to update the database on an annual basis .
