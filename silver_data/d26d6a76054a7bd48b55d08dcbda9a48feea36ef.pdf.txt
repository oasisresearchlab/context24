Like many intracellular pathogens , V . parahaemolyticus invades host cells during 20 infection by deamidating host small Rho GTPases . The Rho GTPase deamidating activity of 21 VopC , a type three secretion system ( T3SS ) translocated effector , drives V . parahaemolyticus 22 invasion . The intracellular pathogen uropathogenic Escherichia coli ( UPEC ) invades host cells 23 by secreting a VopC homolog , the secreted toxin cytotoxic necrotizing factor one ( CNF1 ) . 24 Because of the homology between VopC and CNF1 , we hypothesized topical application of 25 CNF1 during V . parahaemolyticus infection could supplement VopC activity . Here , we 26 demonstrate that CNF1 improves the efficiency of V . parahaemolyticus invasion , a bottleneck in 27 V . parahaemolyticus infection , across a range of doses . CNF1 increases V . parahaemolyticus 28 invasion independent of both VopC and the T3SS altogether , but leaves a disproportionate 29 fraction of intracellular bacteria unable to escape the endosome and complete their infection 30 cycle . This phenomenon holds true in the presence or absence of VopC , but is particularly 31 pronounced in the absence of a T3SS . The native VopC , by contrast , promotes a far less efficient 32 invasion , but permits the majority of internalized bacteria to escape the endosome and complete 33 their infection cycle . These studies highlight the significance of enzymatic specificity during 34 infection , as virulence factors ( VopC and CNF1 in this instance ) with similarities in function 35 ( bacterial uptake ) , catalytic activity ( deamidation ) , and substrates ( Rho GTPases ) are not 36 sufficiently interchangeable for mediating a successful invasion for neighboring bacterial 37 pathogens . 38 39 40 41 IMPORTANCE : Many species of intracellular bacterial pathogens target host small Rho - 42 GTPases to initiate invasion , including the human pathogens Vibrio parahaemolyticus and 43 uropathogenic Eschericia coli ( UPEC ) . The type three secretion system ( T3SS ) effector VopC of 44 V . parahaemolyticus promotes invasion through the deamidation of Rac1 and CDC42 in the host , 45 whereas the secreted toxin cytotoxic necrotizing factor one ( CNF1 ) drives UPEC’s 46 internalization through the deamidation of Rac1 , CDC42 , and RhoA . Despite these similarities in 47 the catalytic activity of CNF1 and VopC , we observed the two enzymes were not 48 interchangeable . Although CNF1 increased V . parahaemolyticus endosomal invasion , most 49 intracellular V . parahaemolyticus aborted their infection cycle and remained trapped in 50 endosomes . Our findings illuminate how the precise biochemical fine - tuning of T3SS effectors is 51 essential for efficacious pathogenesis . They moreover pave the way for future investigations into 52 the biochemical mechanisms underpinning V . parahaemolyticus endosomal escape , and more 53 broadly , the regulation of successful pathogenesis . 54 55 Introduction 56 Bacterial pathogens are masters of biochemistry , utilizing a diverse array of virulence factors to 57 acquire nutrients from the host , avoid the host immune response , and modulate host signaling 58 during infection ( 1 ) . Many species of Gram - negative bacteria couple these strategies with 59 invasion of host cells to establish an intracellular replicative niche . Factors that mediate bacterial 60 invasion of the host may take many forms , but their mechanisms of action commonly converge 61 on Rho GTPase signaling within host cells ( 2 ) . Rho GTPases act as molecular switches that are 62 active when bound to their GTP substrate , enabling them to interact with downstream signaling 63 proteins . Once a Rho GTPase hydrolyzes GTP to GDP , however , the enzyme undergoes a 64 conformational change and can no longer interact with its downstream targets ( 3 ) . Three of the 65 best - characterized Rho GTPases in eukaryotic cells are RhoA , Rac1 , and CDC42 , which 66 contribute to the formation of stress fibers , filipodia , and lamellipodia , respectively , through the 67 regulation of actin polymerization ( 3 ) . 68 As regulators of myriad downstream processes in the cell and of one another , Rac1 , 69 RhoA , and CDC42 represent prime targets for manipulation by intracellular pathogens during the 70 host invasion process . Vibrio parahaemolyticus , a Gram - negative , halophilic bacterium endemic 71 to estuarine and marine environments , is one such organism that avails itself of these targets . V . 72 parahaemolyticus possesses a wide variety of virulence factors , including two type three 73 secretion systems ( T3SS ) and secreted hemolysins . Most relevant to this study is the second 74 T3SS , T3SS2 , that mediates a Rac1 - and CDC42 - dependent invasion of the host ( 4 – 6 ) . The 75 effector CNF1 - family deamidase VopC constitutively activates Rac1 and CDC42 through the 76 deamidation of the conserved glutamine 61 residue on both proteins , inducing actin 77 polymerization at the plasma membrane , membrane ruffling , and finally , uptake of the bacteria 78 into the host ( Fig . 1A ) ( 4 , 7 ) . VopC translocation , and thus its deamidase activity , is contingent 79 on the presence of an N - terminal T3SS secretion signal and chaperone binding domain ( Fig . 80 S1A ) ( 8 ) . Once inside , V . parahaemolyticus inhibits MAPK signaling in the host , stimulates 81 stress fiber formation and bundling , cripples the host reactive oxygen species response , and 82 induces cytotoxicity through multiple mechanisms in addition to enterotoxicity ( 9 – 14 ) . 83 V . parahaemolyticus is not the only bacteria to utilize complex secretion systems to target 84 Rho GTPases during infection . For example , the T3SS effector Pnf of insect pathogen 85 Photorhabdus asymbiotica both deamidates and transglutaminates RhoA and Rac1 to facilitate 86 invasion ( 15 ) . The enteric pathogen Salmonella enterica also translocates multiple effectors into 87 the host through a T3SS , including SopE , SopE2 , and SopB , to stimulate invasion through 88 CDC42 and Rac1 activation . However , these effectors function as exchange factors ( GEFs ) that 89 activate CDC42 and Rac1 by charging them with a steady supply of GTP substrate , rather than 90 constitutively activating the Rho GTPases through deamidation or another modification ( 16 ) . 91 Interestingly , Burkholderia cenocepacia , an opportunistic pathogen commonly associated with 92 lung infections in human cystic fibrosis patients , delivers TecA , its own deamidase of RhoA , 93 Rac1 , and CDC42 , into the host cytoplasm by way of a toxin - loaded “harpoon” called a type six 94 secretion system ( T6SS ) ( 17 ) . Unlike VopC and Pnf , however , the deamidation of Rho GTPase 95 residues targeted by TecA result in their deactivation , not the constitutive activation ( 17 ) . 96 Like V . parahaemolyticus , uropathogenic Escherica coli ( UPEC ) also mediates an 97 intracellular infection by deamidating host Rho GTPases with the toxin cytotoxic necrotizing 98 factor one ( CNF1 ) . Unlike V . parahaemolyticus ’s VopC , however , CNF1 targets RhoA , in 99 addition to CDC42 and Rac1 , and is secreted into the extracellular space rather than translocated 100 through a T3SS ( 18 ) . CNF1 contains five primary domains ( Fig . S1A ) . The first three domains 101 ( D1 - 3 ) cumulatively responsible for interacting with the host p37LR laminin receptor precursor 102 protein and translocation into the host ( 19 , 20 ) . The latter two domains of CNF1 ( D4 - 5 ) 103 respectively encode an ADP - ribosyltransferase - like domain of unknown function , DUF4765 , and 104 a deamidase domain fused to a Lutheran ( Lu ) adhesion glycoprotein / basal cell adhesion 105 molecule ( BCAM ) binding motif ( 19 – 21 ) . The exact manner by which CNF1 is secreted remains 106 unknown , as it does not appear to contain a cleavable secretion signal ; however , interaction with 107 both p37LR and Lu / BCAM receptors appear to be necessary to trigger toxin endocytosis after 108 secretion ( 7 , 19 – 22 ) . Within the vacuole CNF1 is activated by pH - dependent cleavage , and 109 subsequently enters the host cytoplasm through an unidentified mechanism , where it deamidates 110 Rac1 , RhoA , and CDC42 at the plasma membrane to induce membrane ruffling and promote 111 bacterial internalization ( Fig . 1B ) ( 21 , 23 ) . 112 Many different bacteria have adopted invasion strategies combining the Rho GTPase 113 deamidation invasion mechanism of the CNF superfamily with a secreted cytotoxin delivery 114 mechanism ( 24 , 25 ) . For example , an isolate of calf and piglet pathogenic E . coli was found to 115 contain a cytotoxin deemed CNF2 with 90 % homology to CNF1 , and Yersinia 116 pseudotuberculosis secretes the cytotoxin CNFy , which bears a 65 . 1 % homology to CNF1 ( 24 , 117 26 ) . Multiple Bordetella species also carry the DNT ( dermonectrotizing toxin ) , which has been 118 shown to activate RhoA , Rac1 , and CDC42 by transglutaminating the same residues deamidated 119 by CNF1 and its aforementioned homologues ; however , DNT does not appear to be secreted , or 120 even to leave the bacterial cytoplasm during infection ( 24 , 27 ) . 121 Despite the considerable homology between these conserved Rho GTPase deamidases , 122 differences in domain organization and sequences across these enzymes contribute to substantial 123 diversity among them . Evolutionary pressure modulates the catalytic activity , efficiency , and 124 temporal regulation of otherwise similar effectors to operate efficiently in concert with 125 biochemical arsenals unique to each bacterial species ( 28 ) . Such differences between homologs 126 are thus highly illustrative of the differences between life cycles and infection mechanisms of 127 bacterial pathogens . Moreover , although individual variations between these homologs may 128 prove challenging to identify , aggregate differences between homologs such as those within the 129 CNF deamidase superfamily can be identified by testing the cross - compatibility of conserved 130 virulence factors . As members of the CNF1 deamidase superfamily , the catalytic domains of 131 VopC and CNF1 share only a 24 % amino acid sequence identity , but contain conserved catalytic 132 cysteine and histidine residues ( Fig S1 ) ( 4 ) . We consequently hypothesized , based on the 133 enzymes’ homology , that CNF1 could complement VopC in mediating bacterial invasion of the 134 host ( Fig . S1 ) ( 5 , 24 , 29 ) . 135 To test our hypothesis , we began with the V . parahaemolyticus CAB2 strain , derived 136 from the clinical isolate RIMD2210633 , in which the hemolysin - encoding genes and the 137 transcriptional regulator of the first T3SS have been deleted ( Table 1 ) ( 4 ) . With this strain , we 138 were able to assess the importance of the T3SS2 and its effectors during in vitro infection assays 139 without interference by other virulence systems . To determine whether CNF1 could promote 140 invasion of V . parahaemolyticus , purified CNF1 was added to HeLa cells during infection with 141 CAB2 . We observed that CNF1 correlated with increased invasion of CAB2 across a range of 142 doses , and that CNF1 treatment did not adversely affect HeLa cells . We also found that treatment 143 of HeLa cells with a catalytically inactive mutant of CNF1 during infection with CAB2 did not 144 significantly impact bacterial invasion . Next , we assessed the effect of CNF1 treatment on 145 invasion - deficient mutants CAB2Δ vopC , which does not express the T3SS2 effector VopC 146 necessary for invasion , and CAB4 , which cannot express hemolysins , the T3SS1 , or the T3SS2 147 ( 4 ) . Neither strain was able to invade host cells after treatment with the catalytic dead mutant of 148 CNF1 ; however , treatment with wild type CNF1 promoted the invasion of both CAB2Δ vopC and 149 CAB4 . CNF1 treatment , but not with the catalytic dead mutant of CNF1 , increased V . 150 parahaemolyticus invasion across all three strains . Although , few intracellular CAB2 and 151 CAB2Δ vopC completed their infection cycle after internalization and the infections of nearly all 152 intracellular CAB4 ( Table1 ) were arrested under the same conditions . A closer examination of 153 CNF1 - treated infections revealed that aborted infections were marked by the confinement of 154 intracellular bacterial to the endosome , while the minority of intracellular V . parahaemolyticus 155 which did escape into the cytosol appeared capable of proliferating , and ultimately egressing 156 from the host as normal . Ultimately , we observed the similarities between CNF1 and VopC were 157 sufficient for CNF1 to drive V . parahaemolyticus invasion independent of VopC , but were 158 insufficient for V . parahaemolyticus to establish a productive , intracellular replicative niche . 159 These findings highlight the precision in biochemical regulation and signaling for bacterial 160 pathogens and emphasize more broadly the importance of enzymatic specificity and delivery in 161 mediating the tightly - orchestrated processes of bacterial pathogenesis . 162 163 Results 164 Purified CNF1 improves the invasion efficiency of CAB2 . 165 To determine the capacity of CNF1 to promote bacterial invasion in HeLa cells , we first 166 expressed and purified an N - terminally 6xHis - tagged CNF1 using standard biochemical 167 techniques ( Fig . S2 ) ( 30 ) . We subsequently performed a gentamicin protection assay , in which 168 CAB2 , that had been induced with bile acids to express the T3SS2 , was allotted 2 hours to 169 invade HeLa cells in the presence of 0 , 0 . 5 , 2 . 5 , or 10 µg / mL CNF1 before the application of 170 gentamicin , which killed all extracellular bacteria and spared the intracellular bacteria for 171 quantification ( 31 ) . Consistent with previous research , addition of CNF1 ( up to 10 µg / mL ) did 172 not adversely affect the health of HeLa cells after the 2 hour treatment ( 32 ) . The surviving 173 intracellular bacteria were quantified at 1 hour post - gentamicin treatment ( PGT ) , when the 174 bacteria had invaded and begun replicating within the endosome ( 31 ) . CNF1 at all three tested 175 concentrations correlated with a significant increase in intracellular bacteria at 1 hour PGT , as 176 evidenced by the elevated CFU counts relative to the untreated control . ( Fig . 2A ) . These 177 quantitative findings were corroborated qualitatively by confocal micrographs of HeLa cells 178 infected with bile acid - induced , GFP - expressing CAB2 ( CAB2 - GFP ) taken at 1 hour PGT . 179 Noticeably , the number of cells invaded was higher as more GFP positive bacteria were 180 observed inside a larger number of HeLa cells after 0 . 5 , 2 . 5 , and 10 µg / mL CNF1 treatment than 181 in the untreated control ( Fig 2B ) ( 4 ) . While no significant difference in bacterial invasion was 182 observed between the different concentrations of CNF1 , 2 . 5µg / mL CNF1 yielded the greatest 183 amount of invasion on average , and therefore , was used for all future infection experiments ( Fig . 184 2A ) . 185 186 CNF1 catalytic activity drives CAB2 invasion , culminating in aborted infections 187 Having established both an ideal working concentration of CNF1 and a correlation between 188 CNF1 and increased invasion of HeLa cells by CAB2 , we sought to test if the catalytic activity 189 of CNF1 drove increased CAB2 invasion and to assess the impact of CNF1 - mediated invasion 190 on later stages of infection . We generated a catalytic dead CNF1 mutant as a negative control 191 using PCR mutagenesis to replace the catalytic cysteine 866 residue with an alanine ( CNF1 192 C866A ) . We then expressed and purified CNF1 C866A using the same standard biochemical 193 techniques employed for the purification of wild type CNF1 ( Fig . S2D ) ( 33 , 34 ) . 194 We repeated the gentamicin protection assay and confocal microscopy analysis as 195 described above but extended the gentamicin treatment time to 7 hours and collected intracellular 196 CFU counts and confocal images at 1 , 4 , and 7 hours PGT . These time points were intended to 197 capture CAB2’s behavior at the three major stages of infection of the canonical CAB2 infection 198 cycle : 1 ) confinement to the endosome 2 ) active cytoplasmic replication and 3 ) egress from the 199 host cell ( 31 ) . Consistent with our earlier findings , CAB2 invasion was substantially increased in 200 the presence of 2 . 5µg / mL CNF1 at 1 hour PGT based on CFU counts ( Fig . 2A , 3A ) . 201 Furthermore , treating HeLa cells with 2 . 5µg / mL CNF1 C866A did not increase invasion relative 202 to the untreated control ( Fig . 2A , 3A ) . 203 At 4 hours PGT , we observed an increase in intracellular bacteria for all treatment 204 conditions , consistent with CAB2’s canonical escape from the endosome and cytoplasmic 205 replication at this time point ( Fig . 3A , D , Table S1 ) ( 31 ) . One notable difference observed 206 between the untreated and CNF1 - treated infection conditions , however , was the abundance of 207 GFP positive puncta within the HeLa cells after CNF1 treatment . The bacteria clustered in these 208 puncta strongly resembled those visible at 1 hour PGT , when CAB2 would normally be 209 endosomal , suggesting that CNF1 - treated cells had aborted their infection at endosomal stage 210 after the initial invasion step ( Fig . 3D ) . This hypothesis was corroborated when we observed that 211 CNF1 C866A treatment did not culminate in higher intracellular CFUs than the untreated control 212 CAB2 infection ( Fig . 3A , D ) . We observed that almost all the bacteria infected with CAB2 or 213 CAB2 in the presence of CNF1 C866A transitioned to more dispersed cytoplasmic growth ( Fig . 214 3A , D ) . Finally , the continued presence of GFP positive bacteria in puncta , in conjunction with 215 the persistently elevated CFU count in the CNF1 - treated conditions at 7 hours PGT , suggested 216 that CAB2 infection was arrested at endosomal stage in the presence of CNF1 ( Fig . 3A , D ) . 217 218 CNF1 - mediated invasion is not contingent on VopC or the T3SS2 . 219 Though most CAB2 internalized after CNF1 treatment remained endosome - bound , a relatively 220 small subset of invaded bacteria did appear capable of cytosolic proliferation and completing 221 their infection cycle ( Fig . 3D ) . In a few invaded cells treated with CNF1 we observed the same 222 “dispersed” bacterial distributions reminiscent of cytosolic replication in the canonical V . 223 parahaemolyticus life cycle at 4 hours PGT ( Fig . 3D ) . Furthermore , bacteria in the dispersed 224 growth morphology were largely absent in the CNF1 - treated condition by 7 hours PGT , while 225 those in the punctate growth morphology remained , suggesting bacteria capable of egressing 226 from the endosome could egress out of the cell also ( Fig . 3D ) . Since VopC is canonically 227 responsible for driving V . parahaemolyticus invasion , and V . parahaemolyticus canonically 228 escapes the endosome by 7 - hours PGT , we sought to determine whether CNF1 - mediated 229 invasion was VopC - dependent . We hoped also to address whether the small population of 230 bacteria apparently able to complete their infection cycle after CNF1 treatment could do so 231 independently of VopC . 232 Thus , we conducted another gentamicin protection assay , this time including alongside 233 CAB2 both the CAB2Δ vopC mutant strain , lacking the VopC effector required for invasion , and 234 the CAB4 strain , lacking hemolysins and the transcriptional regulators for T3SS1 and T3SS2 235 expression ( 4 ) . At 1 , 4 , and 7 hours PGT , CNF1 treatment significantly increased the quantity of 236 intracellular bacteria for all three strains of bacteria relative to the untreated and the CNF1 237 C866A - treated controls , both of which exhibited similar quantities of intracellular CFUs ( Fig . 238 3A - C ) . We also once again examined HeLa cells infected with CAB2 - GFP , CAB2Δ vopC - GFP , 239 and CAB4 - GFP via confocal microscopy . The infection profiles of CAB2 and CAB2Δ vopC - GFP 240 in the presence of CNF1 bore significant similarities . Both exhibited many more GFP - positive 241 bacteria forming puncta within HeLa cells at 1 hour PGT than were observed in the untreated 242 and CNF1 C866A - treated controls . Moreover , this increased presence of punctate bacteria 243 persisted at 4 and 7 hours PGT after CNF1 treatment . At 4h PGT , however , a small subset of 244 CAB2Δ vopC - GFP were observed growing in dispersed clusters reminiscent of the cytosolic 245 growth observed in CAB2 - GFP at the same time point . That these dispersed clusters represented 246 cytosolic growth was evidenced also by their disappearance by 7 hours PGT , indicating egress 247 from HeLa cells ( Fig . 3D - E ) . 248 In contrast with CAB2 - GFP and CAB2Δ vopC - GFP , CAB4 - GFP in the presence of CNF1 249 appeared almost exclusively as puncta at all three time points ( Fig . 4F ) . In the untreated and 250 CNF1 C866A - treated control conditions for CAB2Δ vopC and CAB4 , no infected cells were 251 observed under confocal microscopy , and significantly fewer intracellular CFUs were observed 252 in gentamicin protection assays than were counted in the presence of CNF1 . ( Fig . 3B - C , E - F ) . 253 V . parahaemolyticus internalized after CNF1 treatment remain largely confined to the 254 endosome 255 After identifying two primary intracellular bacterial morphologies , punctate and dispersed , 256 associated with CNF1 treatment , we tested whether these morphologies truly represented 257 endosomal and cytoplasmic replication inside host cells . Because V . parahaemolyticus ’s 258 intracellular life cycle begins within the endosome , and escape into the cytoplasm is preceded by 259 endosome maturation , we immunofluorescently stained for lysosomal - associated membrane 260 protein - 1 ( Lamp - 1 ) , a late endosome marker , in infected HeLa cells for confocal microscopy 261 analysis ( 31 ) . CAB2 - GFP , CAB2Δ vopC - GFP , and CAB4 - GFP in the punctate morphology were 262 surrounded by LAMP - 1 - laden endosomes after CNF1 treatment at 1 , 4 , and 7 hours PGT ( Fig . 4 , 263 insets ) . This LAMP - 1 staining profile was identical to that observed in CAB2 - GFP infections 264 without CNF1 at 1 hour PGT , when the endosomes surrounding bacteria are coated in LAMP - 1 265 ( Fig . 4A ) ( 31 ) . The dispersed morphology of CAB2 - GFP at 4 hours PGT in the absence of CNF1 266 lacks LAMP - 1 staining around the bacteria , indicating a cytosolic locus of replication ( Fig . 4A ) . 267 This in turn suggests CAB2 - GFP and CAB2Δ vopC - GFP in the dispersed morphology are also 268 replicating cytosolically , consistent with the canonical V . parahaemolyticus T3SS2 - mediated 269 infection cycle , as they too lack LAMP - 1 staining around the periphery of the bacterial growth 270 ( 31 ) ( Fig . 4A - B ) . 271 Having qualitatively characterized the dynamics of CNF1 invasion by linking the CNF1 - 272 associated punctate morphology with endosomal localization , we adopted a more quantitative 273 approach to investigate CNF1 - mediated invasion . Although gentamicin protection assays in 274 Figures 3 and 4 demonstrated the capacity of CNF1 to increase invasion , we still had not 275 determined whether this increase was attributable to more HeLa cells infected , more invasion 276 events per cell , or a combination of the two . By extension , we also hoped to determine whether , 277 after CNF1 treatment , CAB4 remained confined to the endosome after invasion more frequently 278 than CAB2 and CAB2Δ vopC . 279 Using confocal microscopy , we first approximated the percentage of HeLa cells infected 280 by CAB2 - GFP , CAB2Δ vopC - GFP , and CAB4 - GFP with and without CNF1 or CNF1 C866A . 281 We confirmed across multiple trials that CAB4 and CAB2Δ vopC were unable to invade at all 282 without CNF1 present ( Fig . 3B - C , E - F ) . However , HeLa cells were invaded by CAB2Δ vopC and 283 CAB4 at 1 hour PGT in the CNF1 - treated condition ( Fig . 3B - C , E - F ) . Though somewhat less 284 pronounced , CAB2 also invaded more cells on average in the presence of CNF1 than in its 285 absence , as was the case for CAB2Δ vopC and CAB4 at 1 , 4 , and 7 hours PGT ( Fig . 3A , D ) . 286 Moreover , we determined that CAB4 invaded slightly fewer cells than did CAB2 or 287 CAB2Δ vopC , which exhibited roughly equal invasion frequency at 1 - hour PGT , though this 288 finding did not translate to significantly fewer intracellular CFUs recovered in the gentamicin 289 protection assays shown in Figures 3A - C ( statistical comparison not shown ) . 290 Comparisons between strains are shown at 4 hours PGT , when endosomal escape 291 normally peaks in the canonical V . parahaemolyticus life cycle ( 31 ) . As expected , 100 % of 292 intracellular bacteria for all strains and treatment conditions were endosomal at 1 hour PGT . The 293 number of endosome - bound bacteria dropped between 1 and 4 hours PGT for CAB2 in all 294 treatment conditions , though a significantly higher fraction of intracellular CAB2 remained 295 endosome - bound in the CNF1 - treated condition at 4 hours PGT than in the control conditions 296 ( Fig . 5 ) . After CNF1 treatment , CAB2Δ vopC also exhibited a small drop in the fraction of 297 endosome - bound bacteria between 1 and 4 hours PGT comparable to that of CNF1 - treated 298 CAB2 , with most of intracellular bacteria remaining endosome - bound at 4 hours PGT , and a 299 small minority escaping to the cytosol ( Fig . 5 ) . CAB4 appeared largely unable to escape the 300 endosome at all by 4 hours PGT ( Fig . 5 ) . At 7 hours PGT , no intracellular CAB2 was observed 301 in the control conditions , as the bacteria had by that time completed their canonical infection 302 cycle and escaped the host ( 31 ) . In contrast , CNF1 - treated CAB2 , CAB2 Δ vopC , and CAB4 all 303 appeared exclusively endosome - bound by 7 hours PGT ( data not shown ) . The absence of 304 cytoplasmic CAB2 and CAB2Δ vopC at 7 hours PGT suggested that the cytoplasmic bacteria 305 observed after CNF1 treatment at 4 hours PGT could successfully complete their infection cycle , 306 and thus could escape the host by the 7 hour time point . The absence of cytoplasmic bacteria of 307 any strain , alongside the continued presence of endosomal bacteria , at 7 hours PGT in the CNF1 308 treatment condition , also suggested that bacteria unable to escape the endosome by , roughly , 4 309 hours PGT would be unable to escape the endosome at all . 310 311 Discussion 312 V . parahaemolyticus exhibits low baseline levels of invasion in vitro , but is nonetheless a 313 leading cause of foodborne acute gastroenteritis with an ever - expanding ecological range as 314 coastal waters warm ( 5 , 35 , 36 ) . Like many Gram - negative bacteria , V . parahaemolyticus 315 infection is predicated upon the deamidation of host Rho GTPases ; however , despite the 316 similarities between mechanisms of entry across bacterial species , relatively little research has 317 focused on cross - species compatibility of these enzymes ( 4 , 17 , 34 ) . The secreted toxin CNF1 318 and T3SS - translocated effector VopC are homologous Rho GTPase deamidases that mediate the 319 invasion of the UPEC and V . parahaemolyticus , respectively ( Fig . 1 , S1 ) ( 4 , 5 ) . Because of this 320 homology , we hypothesized CNF1 could markedly increase invasion levels of V . 321 parahaemolyticus above those mediated by VopC ( 4 ) . To test our hypothesis , we first 322 investigated whether CNF1 could improve V . parahaemolyticus invasion in a tissue culture 323 model . We found that CNF1 increased the frequency of V . parahaemolyticus invasion , but that 324 VopC , despite its inefficiency , facilitates the full course of V . parahaemolyticus infection in 325 ways that CNF1 does not . In fact , although CNF1 drastically increased V . parahaemolyticus 326 invasion frequency , most endosomal V . parahaemolyticus aborted their infection process after 327 CNF1 - mediated invasion , and never escaped from the endosome into the host cytoplasm ( Fig . 328 3B , 7 ) . We also determined that CNF1 drives V . parahaemolyticus invasion in the absence of 329 both VopC and the T3SS2 altogether , and confirmed CAB2 , CAB2Δ vopC , and CAB4 all 330 remained largely unable to progress past the invasion stage of infection after CNF1 treatment 331 ( Fig . 3 , 5 ) . A closer examination of these infections revealed that a small - but - significant fraction 332 of CAB2 and CAB2Δ vopC did , in fact , complete their infection cycle after CNF1 treatment , 333 while CAB4 remained almost entirely endosome - bound for the entirety of the infection ( Figs . 4 334 and 5 ) . In addition to demonstrating the capacity of CNF1 to promote invasion in a VopC - and 335 T3SS - independent manner , these experiments indicated that endosomal escape was VopC - 336 independent . The absence of cytoplasmic CAB4 - GFP during these infections , along with the 337 presence of cytoplasmic CAB2 and CAB2Δ vopC , point to the necessity of the VtrABC signaling 338 cascade , the regulatory apparatus of the T3SS2 and associated virulence factors disrupted in 339 CAB4 , but intact in CAB2 and CAB2Δ vopC , in mediating endosomal escape , as well as T3SS2 340 expression ( 4 , 37 ) . 341 In examining the infection dynamics of bacteria internalized after CNF1 treatment , we 342 concluded , based on the inability of CNF1 C866A to promote invasion in the absence of VopC 343 or to increase invasion above untreated levels , that the CNF1 - dependent increase in the invasion 344 of HeLa cells by CAB2 , CAB2Δ vopC , and CAB4 was attributable to the catalytic activity of the 345 CNF1 ( Fig . 3 ) . We could also deduce from this the substitution of cysteine 866 in the CNF1 346 active site with an alanine was sufficient to disrupt the enzyme’s ability to promote bacterial 347 invasion ( Fig . 3 ) . Moreover , since untreated and CNF1 C866A - treated CAB2 had egressed from 348 nearly all cells by 7 hours PGT , and because the presence of gentamicin in the medium 349 prevented escaped CAB2 from re - infecting new HeLa cells , we determined that bacteria 350 confined to the endosome by 4 hours PGT after CNF1 - mediated infection remained permanently 351 endosome - bound unless killed by fusion with the lysosome ( Fig . 3D ) . This hypothesis held true 352 for both CAB2Δ vopC and CAB4 after treatment with CNF1 as well , since almost all CAB4 353 remained endosome - bound at all time points , and while cytoplasmic CAB2Δ vopC were observed 354 at 4 hours PGT alongside many endosomal bacteria , all intracellular CAB2Δ vopC observable by 355 7 hours PGT were endosomal ( Fig . 3E , F ) . 356 Our quantitative analyses counted significantly more intracellular CAB2 and 357 CAB2Δ vopC at 1 hour PGT than we did CAB4 at the same time point ( Fig . 3A - C ) . Because 358 CAB2 and CAB2Δ vopC at 1 hour PGT after CNF1 treatment did not differ significantly from 359 one another , we could rule out the possibility of native VopC contributing significantly to the 360 aforementioned difference in invasion levels . With CNF1 established as the primary diver of 361 invasion , we speculate that the differences observed in intracellular bacterial counts at 1 - hour 362 PGT were rooted not in any difference in the internalization efficiency across strains , but the 363 number of bacteria available for internalization in the first place . It is likely that CAB4’s reduced 364 intracellular bacterial counts after CNF1 treatment rest in some defect in adhesion to the host . 365 Corroborating this notion is the established role of T3SS translocon pores in adhesion ; thus , 366 because CAB4 cannot produce any T3SS components ( to say nothing of other potential adhesion 367 factors regulated by the VtrABC signaling cascade ) , and adhesion is a well - established 368 prerequisite for invasion , CAB4 may , of the strains tested , uniquely lack a full complement of 369 adhesion machinery required for efficient invasion ( 38 , 39 ) . 370 More pertinent to our original research question is our observation that the fates of V . 371 parahaemolyticus internalized via CNF1 differ substantially from those which invade in a VopC - 372 dependent manner . At the most basic level , the issue may rest simply in the capacity of 373 internalized bacteria to translocate effectors at all . Ordinarily , V . parahaemolyticus are able to 374 invade only after the T3SS2 has engaged with the host plasma membrane and translocated VopC 375 into the host cytosol ( 4 ) . V . parahaemolyticus is able to adhere to host cells independently of the 376 T3SS2 , however , suggesting that the addition of CNF1 may promote invasion of bacteria that 377 have adhered to the host plasma membrane , but have not engaged the T3SS2 and translocated 378 effectors ( 40 – 42 ) . Since endosomal escape appears to hinge on VtrABC signaling , and plausibly 379 on the T3SS2 itself , many of the bacteria internalized by CNF1 may have been so prematurely , 380 without the T3SS2 engaged , and are thus unable to deliver the virulence factors necessary to 381 promote endosomal escape into the host cytosol . 382 Another potential culprit behind the inability of V . parahaemolyticus internalized by 383 CNF1 to escape the endosome is the difference in specificity of CNF1 and VopC . Both VopC 384 and CNF1 target Rac1 and CDC42 , but only CNF1 deamidates RhoA ( Fig . 1 ) . Although CDC42 , 385 Rac1 , and RhoA are highly conserved and all regulate the actin cytoskeleton in a general sense , 386 the differences between them are not negligible . Active Rac1 and CDC42 promote filament 387 stabilization by binding and activating the kinase PAK1 , which phosphorylates and activates 388 LIM - K kinases responsible for deactivating the actin depolymerizing enzyme cofilin through 389 phosphorylation ( 43 , 44 ) . These proteins in their GTP - bound state also promote the nucleation 390 and elongation of actin branches , rather than de novo actin filaments , respectively by interacting 391 with WASP and WAVE proteins that bind and recruit the ARP2 / 3 complex ( 45 – 47 ) . Active 392 RhoA , by contrast , promotes actin polymerization and filament elongation through the 393 upregulation of formins such Daam and mDia , which nucleate and polymerize monomeric actin 394 into new filaments ( 48 , 49 ) . RhoA is also able to stabilize these filaments through the 395 phosphorylation and activation of LIM - K , as are Rac1 and CDC42 ; however , RhoA does so by 396 engaging a different signaling pathway than Rac1 and CDC42 , as it binds and activates RhoA - 397 associated kinases , ROCKs , to phosphorylate and activate LIM - K , rather than signaling through 398 PAK ( 43 , 50 ) . 399 As many V . parahaemolyticus virulence factors target the actin cytoskeleton , it stands to 400 reason that even slight differences in substrate specificity between VopC and CNF1 could 401 culminate in significantly different outcomes for the bacteria during infection . VopC evolved to 402 function against the backdrop of a very specific battery of effectors targeting the actin 403 cytoskeleton . For example , the V . parahaemolyticus T3SS2 effector VopL drives the 404 polymerization of nonfunctional actin fibers through its three WH2 domains , while the catalytic 405 activity of the T3SS2 effector VopV binds and bundles actin filaments during infection ( 12 , 51 ) . 406 The activities of both effectors could conflict with those of an activated RhoA . The 407 nonfunctional VopL - mediated actin fibers are intended to sequester actin , and thus may not be 408 sufficient for doing so when RhoA is driving actin filament polymerization at the same time . 409 Likewise , VopV’s actin bundling activity is not dissimilar to that of RhoA - regulated myosin , and 410 thus the upregulation of myosin - mediated actin bundling may compete or conflict with VopV’s 411 intended targets ( 12 , 52 , 53 ) . 412 Another interesting observation is the presence of a DUF4765 domain , a putative ADP - 413 ribsoyltransferase domain , in D4 of CNF1 ( Fig S1A ) . The role of this domain and its 414 contributions to the infection process of UPEC are not known , but its fusion to the deamidase 415 catalytic domain of CNF1 ensures that both enzymes are proximal to one another throughout the 416 UPEC infection process ( 20 ) . V . parahaemolyticus also translocates an ADP - ribosyltransferase 417 into the host as an effector the T3SS2 , VopT ( 10 ) . Thus while both the CNF1 and VopC 418 deamidases are likely functioning in the presence of an ADP - ribosyltransferase , CNF1 is ( albeit 419 putatively ) fused to this enzyme , wherease VopC is simple translocated alongside it . While 420 further research is necessary to elucidate the target and catalytic activity of the CNF1 D4 421 domain , the question of whether or how colocalization of an ADP - ribosyltransferase with a 422 deamidase affects the fate of intracellular bacteria is an interesting and open one ( 5 , 10 , 20 ) . 423 The differences between the intracellular environment after VopC - mediated invasion and 424 CNF1 - mediated invasion may be especially stark , since VopC should , in theory , repress RhoA 425 activity , while CNF1 constitutively activates RhoA . Rac1 has been shown to repress RhoA 426 signaling , and not only can CDC42 promote Rac1 activation , but both Rac1 and CDC42 have 427 been shown specifically to block the phosphorylation and activation of myosin through PAK 428 signaling as well ( 53 , 54 ) . The picture is complicated by the T3SS2 effector VopO , which acts as 429 a GEF of RhoA and has been linked to maintaining the efficiency of V . parahaemolyticus 430 invasion ; however , VopO may act as a precise counterbalance to the predicted downstream 431 effects of VopC . Since Rac1 - mediated repression of RhoA is thought to occur through 432 downregulation of GEFs , V . parahaemolyticus may leave only a relatively few translocated 433 VopO molecules to maintain RhoA activity , possibly ( though speculatively ) at a level well below 434 what could be achieved by constitutive activation through deamidation ( 13 , 53 ) . A hypothesis 435 concerning the interplay of these virulence factors might posit that VopC strongly depresses 436 RhoA activity , while VopO serves as a relatively weak counterbalance to VopC against the 437 backdrop of an actin pool depleted by VopL and further modulated by VopV . Within such a 438 model , CNF1 might would function like a thumb on the scale of the delicate balance of V . 439 parahaemolyticus ’s modulation of actin dynamics , leading to the arrest of V . parahaemolyticus 440 infection at the endosomal stage . 441 The reason underlying the incompatibility of CNF1 with the V . para infection cycle is not 442 unprecedented in the bacterial world , or even within V . para . The V . para T3SS2 effector VopA , 443 for example , is a serine , threonine , and lysine acetylase with significant homology to the Yersinia 444 T3SS effector YopJ ( 8 , 51 ) . The key differences between these effectors rests not in their 445 catalytic activities , but in their selective targeting of substrates , analogous the differences in 446 small Rho GTPase targeting between CNF1 and VopC . YopJ possesses the broader range of 447 targets of the two , acetylating and blocking regulatory kinases that regulate JNK , ERK , p38 , and 448 NFkB signaling ( 8 , 51 ) . By broadly blocking MAPK signaling , YopJ shuts down the host innate 449 immune response by preventing cytokine induction ( 51 , 52 ) . By specifically crippling the NFkB 450 pathway , however , YopJ also impairs host anti - apoptotic signaling , promoting cell death ( 51 , 451 52 ) . Yersinia is an extracellular pathogen , and thus stands to benefit from the nutrients released 452 by host apoptosis , just as its survival is enhanced by impairing host innate immune signaling 453 ( 52 ) . V . para , by contrast , replicates intracellularly , and while it , like Yersinia , must evade the 454 host innate immune response to survive , it cannot compromise host survival without also 455 compromising its intracellular replicative niche ( 27 , 52 ) . It should come as little surprise , then , 456 that VopA has evolved to target MAPK signaling less broadly than YopJ , and has been shown to 457 acetylate the regulatory kinases of the JNK , ERK , and p38 signaling pathways , but not those 458 regulating NFkB ( 8 , 53 ) . Thus while V . para blocks the MAPK signaling pathways promoting 459 cytokine induction and apoptosis signaling , likely allowing the intracellular V . para to evade host 460 innate immunity , it leaves the NfKB signaling pathway untouched , avoiding apoptosis induction 461 and the premature destruction of its intracellular replicative niche ( 8 ) . While speculative , it is 462 nonetheless plausible that the target specificity of VopA relative to its close homolog YopJ 463 parallels that of VopC relative to CNF1 , and the relationship between VopA and YopJ highlights 464 how differences in bacterial lifestyle can culminate in divergent evolutionary pressures on 465 virulence factors , which consequently affect the host in radically different ways despite retaining 466 significant homology to one another . 467 Ultimately , our data demonstrate both the efficacy and the limitations of leveraging 468 conserved invasion mechanisms to increase V . parahaemolyticus invasion in vitro . Even as the 469 percentage of invaded HeLa cells increased significantly after the application of CNF1 , the 470 percentage of invaded cell that exhibited aborted V . parahaemolyticus infections also increased , 471 demonstrating that for V . parahaemolyticus , CFN1’s utility as a tool promoting infection 472 efficiency is severely limited . Therefore , the soluble factor CNF1 secreted by UPEC can mediate 473 invasion for neighboring pathogens , but this is unlikely to result in successful virulence . These 474 experiments clearly illustrate the incredible precision that individual bacteria have evolved in 475 their infection processes , such that even highly conserved mechanisms of invasion and infection 476 are not always compatible across species . What remains are many , now - refined questions about 477 the interplay of regulation and virulence factors responsible for each step of infection that future 478 experiments will need to address . 479 480 Materials and Methods 481 Strains and plasmids : 482 The V . parahaemolyticus CAB2 strain was derived from POR1 ( clinical isolate RIMD2210633 483 lacking TDH toxins ) and contains an additional deletion for the gene encoding ExsA , the 484 transcription factor responsible for activating the T3SS1 ( 4 ) . CAB2Δ vopC was derived from 485 CAB2 , containing an additional deletion in the coding sequence for the T3SS2 effector VopC 486 ( 4 ) . CAB4 was derived from POR1 , containing two additional deletions for the gene encoding 487 ExsA , as well as VtrA , the transcription factors responsible for activating the T3SS1 and T3SS2 488 respectively ( 4 ) . CAB2 - GFP , CAB2Δ vopC - GFP , and CAB4 - GFP were generated via a standard 489 triparental mating that transformed each V . parahaemolyticus strain with the pMW - GFP vector 490 ( 58 ) . All strains were grown aerobically in Luria - Bertani ( LB ) medium , supplemented with NaCl 491 to a final concentration of 3 % ( w / v ) ( marine LB , or MLB ) at 30°C . Strains expressing GFP were 492 grown under identical conditions , with the addition of 50 μg / mL spectinomycin . 493 494 Expression and purification of CNF1 495 CNF1 was expressed from E . coli BL21 transformed with pET28a containing a copy of cnf1 as 496 sequenced by Falbo , et al . with an N - terminal 6xHis tag ( 59 ) . The vector was synthesized by 497 Twist Bioscience . BL21 containing the CNF1 expression vector were grown to exponential 498 growth phase in 2xyT media aerobically at 37°C , and expression of CNF1 was induced overnight 499 in 0 . 4 mM isopropyl - β - D - thiogalactopyranoside aerobically at 20°C . Induced bacteria were 500 pelleted and lysed via sonication , and clarified lysates were incubated with Qiagen NiNTA resin 501 ( 30210 ) nutating at 4°C . Protein - bound resin was transferred to a column , which was 502 subsequently washed with 20 mM imidazole in 50mM Tris - HCl pH8 . 0 , 150mM NaCl , and the 503 toxin was eluted with 250 mM imidazole in 50mM Tris - HCl pH8 . 0 , 150mM NaCl . The toxin 504 was subsequently buffer exchanged via gel filtration chromatography ( Superdex 200 HiLoad 505 16 / 600 GE28 - 9893 - 35 ) in 50mM Tris - HCl pH8 . 0 , 150mM NaCl , and concentrated to 5mg / mL 506 in an Amicon 100kDa spin filter at 4°C . The toxin was aliquoted , flash frozen in liquid nitrogen , 507 and kept at - 80°C for storage . CNF1 C866A was generated via PCR mutagenesis using primers 508 designed with Agilent Quickchange Primer design , pET28a with cnf1 as a template , and Thermo 509 Phusion polymerase . 510 511 512 Gentamicin protection assays : 513 HeLa cells were plated in triplicate in a 96 - well tissue culture plate at 7 * 10 4 cells / ml per well and 514 grown for 16 - 18h . Bacteria were added to triplicate wells of HeLa cell monolayers for infection 515 in media containing no additives , 2 . 5µg / mL CNF1 , or 2 . 5µg / mL CNF1 C866A . All infections 516 were carried out at a MOI of 10 , and bacteria were induced for 1 . 5 h in MLB media 517 supplemented with 0 . 5 % w / v bile salts prior to infection ( Sigma Aldrich B3883 ) . Infections were 518 synchronized by centrifugation at 1000xg for 5 minutes after addition of bacteria to wells , and 519 allowed to infect HeLa cells for 2 hours . Gentamicin was added at 100µg / mL to each well after 2 520 h of infection to kill extracellular bacteria . At each indicated time point , monolayers of HeLa 521 cells were washed with PBS and cells were lysed by incubation with PBS containing 0 . 5 % Triton 522 X - 100 for 10 min at room temperature with agitation . Serial dilutions of lysates were plated on 523 MMM ( minimal marine medium ) plates and incubated at 30 °C overnight for subsequent CFU 524 enumeration . 525 526 Infection assays for confocal imaging : 527 HeLa cells were seeded onto 6 - well plates containing sterile coverslips at a density of 7 * 10 4 528 cell / mL . Following infections with V . parahaemolyticus strains at an MOI of 10 and addition of 529 CNF1 / CNF1 C866A as detailed above , cells were washed with PBS and fixed in 3 . 2 % ( v / v ) 530 paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature . Fixed cells were washed in PBS and 531 permeabilized with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 for 10 min at room temperature . Nuclei and actin 532 cytoskeleton were stained with Hoechst 33342 ( Sigma ) and rhodamine - phalloidin ( Molecular 533 Probes ) , respectively , for infection analyses and quantification . For evaluating endosomal 534 localization of bacteria , nuclei , actin cytoskeleton , and Lamp - 1 were stained with Hoechst 33342 535 ( Sigma ) , Alexafluor680 - phalloidin ( Molecular Probes ) , and Mouse anti - Lamp1 ( Abcam 536 Ab25630 ) respectively as described previously ( 31 ) . Images were collected using a Zeiss LSM 537 710 confocal microscope . 538 539 Quantification of confocal images : 540 The assessment of whether bacteria were endosomal or cytoplasmic was predicated on whether 541 the bacteria were growing in the punctate or dispersed morphology as described above . The 542 fractions of infected cells containing exclusively endosomal bacteria out of the total number of 543 infected cells on each cover slip were collected for each bacterial strain , time point , and 544 treatment ( either with nothing , CNF1 , or CNF1 C866A ) , and the fractions for each condition 545 averaged across three experiments . All quantifications were collected blind to the identity of 546 each sample . 547 548 Growth curve : 549 Strains were grown overnight shaking at 30°C in MLB supplemented with 50µg / mL 550 spectinomycin . For comparison of growth rates , overnights were used to inoculate 50mL MLB 551 supplemented with 50µg / mL spectinomycin at a starting OD 600 = 0 . 02 in triplicate . Cultures were 552 incubated at 30°C shaking , with OD 600 measurements collected hourly for 8 hours , and once 553 more after 32 hours . Each data point represents an average of three technical replicates . 554 555 Statistical analysis : 556 Unless otherwise stated , all data are presented as mean ± standard deviation of three or more 557 independent experiments . All experiments discussed in this paper were conducted in triplicate . A 558 two - way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test was conducted to evaluate statistical 559 significance between all variables . A P value of < 0 . 05 was deemed significant . 560 561 Acknowledgements 562 We thank the Orth lab members for discussions and editing .

( A ) V . 741 parahaemolyticus ( i ) adheres to the host cell surface , where it translocates effectors across the 742 host cell membrane into the cytoplasm through the T3SS2 , including VopC . ( ii ) VopC 743 deamidates glutamine 61 of both Rac1 and CDC42 at the plasma membrane , constitutively 744 activating the Rho GTPases to promote the polymerization of actin branches and ruffling of the 745 plasma membrane . ( iii ) Membrane ruffles engulf V . parahaemolyticus , culminating in its 746 internalization in a primary vacuole . ( B ) UPEC ( i ) adheres to the host cell surface and secretes 747 the toxin CNF1 into the extracellular space through an unknown mechanism . CNF1 then binds 748 Lutheran basal cell adhesion molecule ( BCAM ) receptors . ( ii ) CNF1 is endocytosed . ( iii ) 749 acidification triggers CNF1 cleavage and export through an unknown mechanism into the host 750 cytoplasm . ( iv ) CNF1 deamidates glutamine 61 of Rac1 and CDC42 , and glutamine 63 on RhoA , 751 constitutively activating all three Rho GTPases to promote actin filament polymerization and 752 ruffling of the plasma membrane .

CAB2 adheres to the host and invades in a VopC - or CNF1 - 813 mediated mechanism by 1 hour PGT . Bacteria escape from the endosome into the cytoplasm by 814 4 hours PGT , and ultimately escape from and kill the host - cell by 7 hours PGT . In the presence 815 of CNF1 , a majority of infected cells exhibit no endosomal escape at 4 hours PGT , and these 816 bacteria remain confined to the endosome even by 7 hours PGT . ( D - F ) CAB2Δ vopC infection 817 progression . Due to the absence of VopC , CAB2Δ vopC is unable to invade the host without 818 biochemical supplementation , but is able to invade the host in the presence of CNF1 . Bacteria 819 escape from the endosome into the cytoplasm by 4 hours PGT , and ultimately escape from and 820 kill the host - cell by 7 hours PGT . In the presence of CNF1 , a majority of infected cells exhibit no 821 endosomal escape at 4 hours PGT , and these bacteria remain confined to the endosome even by 7 822 hours PGT .
