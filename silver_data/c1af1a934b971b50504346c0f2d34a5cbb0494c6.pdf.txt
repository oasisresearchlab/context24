In yeast they are involved in regu - lating the docking and fusion of secretory vesicles with the cell surface . Our analysis of a Rho3 mutant that is unable to interact with the Exo70 subunit of the exocyst reveals a normal polarization of the exocyst complex as well as other polarity markers . We also ﬁnd that there is no redundancy between the Rho3 – Exo70 and Rho1 – Sec3 pathways in the localization of the exocyst . This R suggests that Rho3 and Cdc42 act to polarize exocytosis by activating the exocytic machinery at the membrane without the need to ﬁrst recruit it to sites of polarized growth . Consistent with this model , we ﬁnd that the ability of Rho3 and Cdc42 to hydrolyze GTP is not required for their role in secretion . Moreover , our analysis of the Sec3 subunit of the exocyst suggests that polarization of the exocyst may be a consequence rather than a cause of po - larized exocytosis . Introduction In eukaryotic cells , exocytosis is the major route by which newly synthesized proteins and lipids are delivered to the cell surface . This process involves the directed transport , docking , and fusion of Golgi - derived secretory vesicles with the plasma membrane . In Saccharomyces cerevisiae , polarization of exo - cytosis is tightly coordinated with the overall polarity of the cell . Much of the protein machinery responsible for cell polar - ity and exocytosis is itself concentrated at sites of polarized growth ( Pruyne and Bretscher , 2000 ) . In yeast , the polarized delivery of vesicles along actin ca - bles is thought to be performed by a type V myosin Myo2 and the Rab GTPase Sec4 ( Goud et al . , 1988 ; Pruyne et al . , 1998 ) . Elegant genetic and biochemical analyses have shown that a multisubunit complex known as the exocyst complex or Sec6 – Sec8 complex is required for the docking and fusion of secre - tory vesicles at the plasma membrane ( Terbush et al . , 1996 ; Guo et al . , 1999 ) . The secretory machinery , including Myo2 , Sec4 , and the exocyst complex , is concentrated at sites of ac - tive growth to enable the polarized fusion of secretory vesicles with the plasma membrane . The final step of the exocytic pro - cess requires the formation of complexes between the v - SNAREs Snc1 / 2 , located on the secretory vesicles , and the plasma mem - brane t - SNAREs Sec9 and Sso1 / 2 , distributed around the pe - riphery of the cell ( Brennwald et al . , 1994 ) . Recent studies from our laboratory have implicated Rho GTPases in the regulation of exocytosis ( Adamo et al . , 1999 , 2001 ) . In addition , physical interactions between specific Rho proteins and two subunits of the exocyst complex have been re - ported . Rho1 and Cdc42 have been shown to bind to the NH 2 - terminal domain of Sec3 to promote its polarization , and Rho3 interacts with Exo70 , another subunit of the exocyst ( Robinson et al . , 1999 ; Guo et al . , 2001 ; Zhang et al . , 2001 ) . We have shown that Rho3 and Cdc42 have specific and direct roles in post - Golgi secretion , which are independent of their roles in other aspects of polarity and morphogenesis ( Adamo et al . , 1999 , 2001 ) . However , the precise mechanism by which Rho3 and Cdc42 regulate exocytosis is presently unclear . Here , we report that , like cdc42 - 6 , the cold - sensitive rho3 - V51 allele has a secretion defect that does not involve de - tectable effects on the polarized localization of the exocytic machinery . Moreover , GTP hydrolysis by Rho3 and Cdc42 was found to be dispensable for their function in secretion . This suggests that these GTPases act in vesicle docking and fusion at the plasma membrane through allosteric regulation of the exocytic machinery . We propose that the observed polarization of the exocytic apparatus , including the exocyst complex , may be a result of , rather than a cause of , polarized exocytosis .

This mechanism does not require the direct recruitment of factors by the Rho GTPase to the site of polar - ized growth . Recent evidence has shown that much of the exo - cytic machinery is associated with transport carriers destined for the plasma membrane ( Boyd et al . , 2004 ) . Thus , the direct asymmetric regulation of exocytosis by activated Rho proteins would reinforce the delivery of secretory vesicles at the site of active growth and lead indirectly to the appearance of a polar - ized secretion machinery . Results The rho3 - V51 secretory defective mutant does not affect the cellular localization of essential secretion and polarity markers To determine the function of Rho3 in the cell , we previously identified four mutants in the effector domain of Rho3 that re - sult in conditional growth defects . Of these , rho3 - V51 was the only allele that exhibited a well polarized actin cytoskeleton , but showed a severe defect in secretion after a shift to the re - strictive temperature ( Adamo et al . , 1999 ) . This was the first demonstration that Rho GTPases could function in exocytic transport independent of their effects on actin . To determine how Rho3 regulates exocytosis , we first ex - amined the effect of the rho3 - V51 mutation on the localization of markers of polarized exocytosis . Our initial analysis in - cluded Cdc42 , Myo2 , and Sec4 . Cdc42 is an essential Rho GTPase involved in polarized assembly of the cytoskeleton and in regulation of the late secretory pathway and is known to po - larize independently of polymerized actin to sites of active growth ( Ayscough et al . , 1997 ) . Sec4 is a member of the Rab GTPase family that acts between the Golgi apparatus and the plasma membrane ( Goud et al . , 1988 ) . Myo2 is an unconven - tional type V myosin implicated in targeting post - Golgi vesicles to the bud tip ( Pruyne et al . , 1998 ) . Sec4 and Myo2 localize to the presumptive bud site and the tip of small budded cells through a mechanism that is sensitive to both the integrity of actin cables and on - going secretion . The localization of these three markers was analyzed in the rho3 - V51 mutant and wild - type cells using affinity - purified antibodies against endogenous proteins . Temperature shifts of 5 h at 14 (cid:1) C were used , as these were previously shown to result in a severe post - Golgi secre - tory defect ( Adamo et al . , 1999 ) . We observed that Cdc42 gave a similar polarized staining pattern in the rho3 - V51 mutant and wild - type cells before and after a shift to 14 (cid:1) C ( Fig . 1 A ) . Quantitation of the number ( i . e . , penetrance ) of cells exhibiting a polarized Cdc42 staining pattern was found to be virtually identical between the rho3 - V51 mutant and wild - type cells at both 25 and 14 (cid:1) C ( Fig . 1 B ) . Furthermore , quantitation of the average intensity ( i . e . , magnitude ) of Cdc42 patch staining in each condition varied by (cid:2) 5 % between the wild - type and the rho3 - V51 mutant . We observed that , as in wild - type cells , Sec4 and Myo2 were polarized in rho3 - V51 cells after a 5 - h shift to the restrictive temperature ( Fig . 1 A ) . Both wild - type and mu - tant cells showed a similar efficiency of polarization for either Sec4 or Myo2 at 25 and 14 (cid:1) C ( Fig . 1 B ) , and there was no sig - nificant effect on the staining intensity . Thus , Myo2 and Sec4 are properly localized in the rho3 - V51 mutant , consistent with the fact that the actin cytoskeleton organization in this mutant is largely unaffected at the restrictive or permissive tempera - ture ( Adamo et al . , 1999 ; unpublished data ) . These results dem - onstrate that rho3 - V51 cells are fully competent in localizing critical factors involved in post - Golgi transport . Post - Golgi vesicle tethering and docking to the plasma membrane is dependent on a multisubunit protein complex known as the exocyst complex . Although the aforementioned results suggest that vesicles are properly delivered to sites of polarized growth in rho3 - V51 cells , it is possible that the accu - mulation of post - Golgi vesicles observed in this mutant could result from a failure in vesicle docking due to the absence of the exocyst complex at sites of polarized growth . To determine if rho3 - V51 cells are defective in polarization of the exocyst complex , we followed the fluorescence associated with three GFP - tagged exocyst subunits Sec3 , Sec8 , and Exo70 . Sec8 and Exo70 are two of the seven essential subunits of the exocyst , and Exo70 has been shown to interact with Rho3 in a GTP - dependent manner ( Robinson et al . , 1999 ) . Sec3 is the only nonessential subunit of the complex , and it has been proposed to act as a spatial landmark for secretion ( Finger et al . , 1998 ) . Figure 1 . Distribution of the polarity and secretion markers Cdc42 , Myo2 , and Sec4 is normal in the rho3 - V51 secretory mutant at both per - missive and nonpermissive temperatures . ( A ) Wild - type ( WT ) and mutant ( rho3 - V51 ) cells were grown at 25 (cid:1) C or shifted to 14 (cid:1) C for 5 h before fix - ation and then processed for fluorescence microscopy .

Exocyst subunits Sec3 , Sec8 , and Exo70 are polarized in the rho3 - V51 secretory mutant at permissive and nonpermissive tem - peratures . ( A ) Plasmids containing functional , COOH - terminal – tagged GFP versions of Sec3 , Sec8 , or Exo70 were introduced into wild - type and rho3 - V51 strains . Transformed cells were grown at 25 (cid:1) C or shifted to 14 (cid:1) C for 5 h and immediately fixed and processed for fluorescence microscopy . DIC images of the same cells are shown . Bar , 2 (cid:3) m . ( B ) Quantitation of Sec3 - GFP , Sec8 - GFP , and Exo70 - GFP polarized localization in wild - type and rho3 - V51 cells . Cells processed as de - scribed in A were scored for the presence of the exocyst components at the emerging bud sites , bud tips , or bud necks . Approximately 50 cells were analyzed under each condition . ( C ) Invertase and Bgl2 secretion assays on GFP - tagged wild - type and rho3 - V51 strains processed as described in A were performed as described previously ( Adamo et al . , 1999 ) . The secretion defect associated with each strain is expressed as the percentage of total ( internal (cid:4) external ) invertase or Bgl2 found internally . Results shown represent the average of three experiments . Error bars represent SD . We found that these exocyst components were polarized in rho3 - V51 cells at the restrictive temperature ( Fig . 2 A ) . Fur - thermore , the percentage of mutant cells displaying polarized subunits was comparable to that observed in wild - type cells ( Fig . 2 B ) . To confirm that the rho3 - V51 strains containing the GFP - tagged exocyst subunits showed secretory defects similar to those described for the parental rho3 - V51 strains , we exam - ined their capacity for secretion of the periplasmic enzymes in - vertase and Bgl2 after a shift to the restrictive temperature . As can be seen in Fig . 2 C we find that , like the parental rho3 - V51 strain , the GFP - tagged derivatives show a pronounced secretory defect for both enzymes . As previously observed for rho3 - V51 , these strains show a partial secretory defect for both enzymes at the permissive temperature , which correlates with post - Golgi vesicle accumulation by electron microscopy ( Fig . 2 C ; Adamo et al . , 1999 ) . The invertase secretion defect is significantly exac - erbated after the shift to 14 (cid:1) C , which also correlates with an in - crease in vesicle accumulation by EM ( Fig . 2 C ; Adamo et al . , 1999 ) . Also , as previously observed , Bgl2 secretion was simi - larly defective at both temperatures ( Fig . 2 C ; Adamo et al . , 1999 ) . Thus , we conclude that the secretory defects present in the rho3 - V51 mutant is not due to an inability to properly local - ize the exocyst complex to sites of polarized growth . Testing the functional redundancy between the Rho – Sec3 and Rho – Exo70 pathways Studies on the yeast exocyst complex have revealed interac - tions of two subunits , Sec3 and Exo70 , with Rho GTPases ( Fig . 3 A ; Robinson et al . , 1999 ; Guo et al . , 2001 ; Zhang et al . , 2001 ) . Exo70 interacts specifically with Rho3 ( Robinson et al . , 1999 ) , and introduction of the V51 mutation in the effector do - main of Rho3 leads to a loss of this interaction ( Adamo et al . , 1999 ) without affecting the localization of Exo70 or other exo - cyst components as described in the preceding section . The Sec3 protein has been shown to interact with both Rho1 and Cdc42 through an NH 2 - terminal Rho - binding domain ( RBD ; Guo et al . , 2001 ; Zhang et al . , 2001 ) . Surprisingly , although the RBD regulates the polarized localization of Sec3 to sites of po - larized growth , its deletion has no effect on the polarized local - ization of the rest of the exocyst complex . Guo et al . ( 2001 ) and Boyd et al . ( 2004 ) have suggested that a parallel pathway in - volving Exo70 may localize the exocyst complex to sites of po - larized growth in the absence of the Rho – Sec3 pathway . This suggested that the lack of an effect of the rho3 - V51 mutant on exocyst localization might be due to redundancy with the Rho – Sec3 pathway in localizing the exocyst complex to sites of po - larized growth ( Fig . 3 A ) . If such redundancy exists between these pathways , then the combination of mutations impairing both the Rho3 – Exo70 and Rho – Sec3 pathways would be ex - pected to be detrimental to the cell . Therefore , we used a mu - tant sec3 - (cid:5) N allele lacking the NH 2 - terminal RBD of SEC3 to replace the genomic wild - type SEC3 locus . The sec3 - (cid:5) N was expressed behind the GPD promoter as in previous studies in - volving sec3 - (cid:5) RBD mutants ( Guo et al . , 2001 ; Wiederkehr et al . , 2003 ) . To detect both wild - type and Sec3 - (cid:5) N proteins , we raised and affinity purified antibodies to a hydrophilic region in the central portion of the Sec3 protein ( Fig . 3 B ) . We observed that cells expressing sec3 - (cid:5) N as the sole copy grew as well as wild - type cells at all temperatures examined . Cellular localiza - tion of the endogenous Sec3 by immunofluorescence revealed a characteristic polarized staining at sites of active exocytosis , whereas the sec3 - (cid:5) N mutant appeared as a diffuse bright stain - ing all over the cell ( Fig . 3 C ) . Under our experimental con - ditions , no detectable portion of Sec3 - (cid:5) N was found to be targeted correctly to sites of cellular growth .

In addition , the average signal intensity of these markers did not display any decrease in the mutant compared with wild type ( Fig . 3 E ) , demonstrating that the proteins were fully com - petent for targeting to sites of polarized secretion . Analysis of rho3 - V51 , sec3 - (cid:1) N double mutants reveals no synthetic effects on growth or polarity To assay for redundancy between the Rho3 – Exo70 and the Rho – Sec3 pathways , we crossed strains containing the sec3 - (cid:5) N and rho3 - V51 alleles to evaluate the phenotype of cells containing both mutations as the only source of Sec3 and Rho3 in the cell . No synthetic effects on growth were observed , as growth of the rho3 - V51 , sec3 - (cid:5) N double mutant is identical to that of the rho3 - V51 mutant at both permissive ( 25 (cid:1) C ) and non - permissive ( 14 (cid:1) C ) conditions ( Fig . 4 A ) . None of the dou - ble mutants showed sensitivity to growth at high tempera - ture ( 37 (cid:1) C ) , and both rho3 - V51 , sec3 - (cid:5) N and rho3 - V51 grew slightly slower than wild - type or sec3 - (cid:5) N strains at 25 (cid:1) C . To determine the extent to which secretion was blocked in the rho3 - V51 , sec3 - (cid:5) N mutant cells , the export of the Bgl2 exo - glucanase was monitored at both 25 and 14 (cid:1) C ( Fig . 4 B ) . Wild - type and sec3 - (cid:5) N cells displayed similar small amounts of internal pools of the enzyme , indicating that deletion of the Sec3 RBD motif did not impair secretion . The rho3 - V51 , sec3 - (cid:5) N strain was found to have a defect in secretion comparable to rho3 - V51 . As expected , a large amount of Bgl2 accumulated in the rho3 - V51 cells and a comparable fraction of enzyme was detected within the rho3 - V51 , sec3 - (cid:5) N double mutant at both temperatures . Therefore , the growth and secretion defects dis - played by rho3 - V51 cells were not amplified in combination with the sec3 - (cid:5) N mutation . Next , we determined whether the loss of Sec3’s ability to interact with Rho proteins had any effect on the localization of components of the exocytic machinery in rho3 - V51 cells . Im - munofluorescence studies on the rho3 - V51 , sec3 - (cid:5) N double mutants demonstrated that Cdc42 , Sec4 , and Myo2 were polar - ized normally after a shift to the nonpermissive temperature of 14 (cid:1) C ( Fig . 5 A ) . In addition , the ability of mutant cells to main - Figure 3 . Testing the redundancy model for Rho function in the polarization of secretory and polarity markers . ( A ) Redundancy model for Rho3 and Rho1 / Cdc42 pathways in po - larizing the exocyst . The Exo70 and Sec3 exo - cyst subunits interact with distinct Rho GTP - ases , and these interactions have been proposed to localize the exocyst complex to help promote secretion and polarity . ( B ) A sec3 mutant strain lacking the NH 2 - terminal RBD ( aa 3 – 320 ) of Sec3 was placed as the only copy of Sec3 in the cell on high copy ex - pression ( see Materials and methods ) . Correct integration of the construct was checked by Western blot analysis of whole cell lysates from wild - type and sec3 - (cid:5) N strains using anti - Sec3 antibodies directed against the middle region of the protein . Blotting with anti - Exo70 antibodies was used as loading control . ( C ) Polarization of distinct secretion markers in the sec3 - (cid:5) N mutant . Wild - type and sec3 - (cid:5) N cells were grown at 25 (cid:1) C , fixed , and processed for immunofluorescence .

The exocyst complex polarization was then investi - gated using GFP - tagged Sec8 and Exo70 subunits and antibod - ies directed against Sec15 . No defect in the localization of these exocyst components was observed at the restrictive tem - perature ( Fig . 5 , A and D ) , showing that the exocyst was polar - ized in rho3 - V51 , sec3 - (cid:5) N cells at 14 (cid:1) C . The amount of cells showing polarized exocyst subunits was determined to be similar in wild - type and mutant strains ( Fig . 5 E ) . Also , exam - ination of the rho3 - V51 , sec3 - (cid:5) N mutant actin cytoskeleton revealed that both patches and cables were polarized at 25 and 14 (cid:1) C ( unpublished data ) . To determine if there was an effect of RHO3 mutants on the dynamics of exocyst polarization , photobleaching was per - formed on Sec8 - GFP – expressing cells and FRAP was ana - lyzed . Wild - type strains expressing Sec8 - GFP from a CEN plasmid were photobleached at the bud tip of small or medium budded cells ( Fig . 6 A ) . Sec8 - GFP had a half - recovery time of (cid:1) 17 s that was fit by a single exponential curve ( Fig . 6 B and Table S1 , available at http : / / www . jcb . org / cgi / content / full / jcb . 200504108 / DC1 ) , similar to previous FRAP measurements ( Boyd et al . , 2004 ) . The corrected fluorescence recovery was measured as (cid:1) 82 % of the prebleach fluorescence intensity ( Table S1 ) . Photobleaching and FRAP measurements of Sec8 - GFP in rho3 - V51 mutants demonstrated that both the t 1 / 2 and fluorescence recovery values were not significantly different from wild - type cells ( Fig . 6 , C and D ) . Likewise , expression of the GTP - locked CEN - RHO3 Q74L as the only source of Rho3 in the cell did not significantly alter Sec8 - GFP recovery rates . Nor did we detect any significant differences in the Sec8 - GFP recovery rates in the sec3 - (cid:5) N single mutant or rho3 - V51 , sec3 - (cid:5) N double mutants from that seen in wild - type cells ( Fig . 6 , C and D ) . Therefore , the analysis of exocyst dynamics using FRAP strongly supports our observations that polarization of this complex is unperturbed in the rho3 - V51 mutants or in the rho3 - V51 , sec3 - (cid:5) N double mutants . Thus , the Rho1 – Sec3 and Rho3 – Exo70 pathways do not appear to act redundantly to de - termine the localization or dynamics of the exocyst complex at sites of polarized growth . Interestingly , we also find kinetics similar to wild - type cells with the RHO3 Q74L GTP - locked mu - tant , suggesting that activation of Rho3 function has no dra - matic effect on the overall dynamics of exocyst polarization . Rho3 , therefore , does not appear to directly regulate exocyst polarization . Moreover , we also find that Rho1 – Sec3 and Rho3 – Exo70 pathways do not act redundantly to determine the localization or dynamics of the exocyst complex at sites of polarized growth . To determine if the loss of the RBD has any effect on Sec3 function in combination with other late secretory mutants , we introduced a sec3 - (cid:5) N or a control SEC3 construct into cdc42 - 6 and several late sec mutants ( Table S1 ) . As with the rho3 - V51 mutant , we found no obvious synthetic effect of the sec3 - (cid:5) N allele on growth of sec9 - 4 cells . However , synthetic effects at semipermissive temperatures were apparent in sec1 - 1 , sec8 - 9 , and , most severely , sec15 - 1 mutant cells . Strikingly , we were unable to obtain transformants of the sec3 - (cid:5) N construct in cdc42 - 6 cells , which we confirmed by meiotic analysis was due to the synthetic lethality of this allele with cdc42 - 6 . There - fore , when secretory function is compromised in certain ways , a positive role for the function of the Rho binding domain of Sec3 is apparent . The synthetic lethality with cdc42 - 6 may in - dicate that this function is especially important in the highly polarized membrane growth during bud emergence , when the secretory defect of cdc42 - 6 is manifested ( Adamo et al . , 2001 ) . Sec3 polarization is sensitive to the same perturbations as other exocyst subunits and other polarity markers A previous study using GFP - tagged Sec3 suggested that the polarization of this subunit of the exocyst was uniquely and re - markably insensitive to perturbations in vesicle transport and actomyosin polarity . These observations led to the suggestion that this subunit may act as a spatial landmark for localization of the exocyst complex and consequently polarization of membrane transport ( Finger et al . , 1998 ) . In light of our previ - ous results , we reexamined the polarization of the native Sec3 protein by using purified antibodies raised against recombi - nant Sec3 ( see Materials and methods ) . To determine if the lo - calization of Sec3 , like other exocyst components , is sensitive to ongoing secretion , we examined Sec3 immunostaining in mutants defective for ER to Golgi transport ( sec21 - 1 and Figure 4 . rho3 - V51 and sec3 - (cid:1) N mutations do not demonstrate any syn - thetic effects on growth and secretion .

We also examined the localization of Sec4 , Myo2 , and Sec15 markers in these strains . As previously re - ported ( Walch - Solimena et al . , 1997 ) , Sec4 was found to be redistributed in myo2 - 66 and ER - to - Golgi mutants and to be polarized in post - Golgi sec mutants after a shift to the restric - tive temperature ( Fig . 7 and not depicted ) . Myo2 and Sec15 concentration in the bud was lost in early or late secretion mu - tants after a 1 - h shift to the restrictive temperature ( Fig . 6 ) , suggesting that Myo2 and Sec15 polarized localization is de - pendent on an active secretory pathway . These results are con - sistent with observations that suggest that both proteins are as - sociated with post - Golgi vesicles ( Pruyne et al . , 1998 ; Guo et al . , 1999 ) , and therefore their polarized localization on the plasma membrane would be expected to depend on ongoing secretion . In contrast to previous studies using GFP - Sec3 , we find that whereas immunostained , native Sec3 was well polar - ized in wild - type cells , a complete loss of polarized staining was observed in both early and late secretion mutants at the re - strictive temperature ( Fig . 7 ) . These data strongly suggest that , like the other subunits of the exocyst , ongoing secretion is re - quired for the polarization of Sec3 . To determine the dependence of native Sec3 polarization on actomyosin function , we made use of a temperature - sensitive tropomyosin mutant strain , tpm1 - 2 ( in a tpm2 (cid:5) background ) , which rapidly loses polarized actin cables after a temperature shift to 34 (cid:1) C . Previous studies have demonstrated that both Sec4 and the exocyst subunit Sec8 rapidly depolarize upon loss of actin cables ( Pruyne et al . , 1998 ) . In contrast , GFP - tagged Sec3 has recently been shown to be resistant to the tpm1 - 2 – induced depolarization ( Zajac et al . , 2005 ) . To determine if native Sec3 behaves similarly to the Sec3 - GFP , we followed its po - larization in this strain by immunofluorescence staining at dif - ferent times after the temperature shift . We also examined the effects of this mutant on Sec4 and Sec15 polarization . As ex - pected , Sec4 and Sec15 were found to rapidly depolarize in the tpm1 - 2 strain with kinetics similar to that seen previously by Pruyne et al . ( 1998 ) for Sec4 and Sec8 in this mutant . However , in contrast to the results of Zajac et al . ( 2005 ) , we find that un - tagged native Sec3 rapidly depolarizes in this strain with kinet - ics that closely match that found for Sec15 . As expected , all three markers remained polarized in the control tpm2 (cid:5) strain ( Fig . 8 ) .

The functions of Rho3 and Cdc42 in secretion do not require GTP hydrolysis The ability of Cdc42 to hydrolyze GTP has been shown to be essential for its ability to promote septin ring assembly and po - larity establishment ( Gladfelter et al . , 2002 ; Irazoqui et al . , 2003 ) . Local cycles of GTP loading and hydrolysis by Cdc42 have been proposed to be critical for the proper assembly of multisubunit complexes and in producing an initial asymmetric patch of Cdc42 . Our analysis of the cdc42 - 6 allele revealed a role for Cdc42 in docking and fusion of secretory vesicles that was independent of its other major functions in cell polarity , in - cluding polarization of actin cytoskeleton , septin ring assem - bly , and polarization of Cdc42 itself ( Adamo et al . , 2001 ) . Sim - ilar to what we observed previously for the rho3 - V51 mutant , cdc42 - 6 cells have a severe exocytic defect but show normal localization of all the markers for polarized exocytosis . This suggests that the mode of action for both Rho GTPases is not in the recruitment of the exocytic machinery but rather by direct allosteric activation of this machinery at sites of growth . One prediction of this allosteric mechanism is that it would not be expected to require GTP hydrolysis to regulate exocytosis . We investigated whether the specific roles of Rho3 and Cdc42 in exocytosis required cycling between GTP and GDP bound forms using mutations analogous to the RAS Q61L allele , which block the ability of Rho GTPases to hydrolyze GTP , as well as the mutants analogous to RAS S17N , resulting in a GDP - locked form of the GTPase . We first examined whether a sin - gle - copy ( CEN ) plasmid containing RHO3 Q74L could suppress several secretion - deficient strains . Although the cold - sensitive Rab GTPase mutant sec4 - P48 was weakly suppressed by CEN - RHO3 , CEN - RHO3 Q74L strongly rescued growth at the restric - tive temperature , whereas the RHO3 T30N GDP - locked mutant failed to suppress ( Fig . 9 A , i ) . These results are similar to those obtained previously using a different activating mutation in RHO3 ( Adamo et al . , 1999 ) . In complementation tests , wild - type and GTP - locked RHO3 alleles were able to equally restore growth of rho3 - V51 cells at 14 (cid:1) C ( Fig . 9 A , ii ) . CEN - RHO3 Q74L was found to be a strong suppressor of the growth defect associ - ated with the cdc42 - 6 mutation at 32 (cid:1) C , and the level of sup - pression was significantly better than CEN - RHO3 ( Fig . 9 A , iii ) . At 37 (cid:1) C , cdc42 - 6 cells have been shown to be altered for both the actin cytoskeleton and secretion ( Adamo et al . , 2001 ) . We observed that constitutively activated RHO3 was not able to re - store growth of cdc42 - 6 at 37 (cid:1) C ( Fig . 9 A , iii ) , suggesting a se - cretion - based specificity in suppression . These results show that GTP hydrolysis by Rho3 is not required for its secretory function . RHO3 is known to have multiple genetic interactions with the exocytic apparatus . Indeed , wild - type RHO3 has the ability to suppress different late - acting sec mutants , and , impor - tantly , the rho3 null allele is suppressed by components of the secretion pathway such as SEC4 , SRO7 , and SEC9 ( Adamo et al . , 1999 ) . We examined the ability of various nucleotide forms of Rho3 to function as the only source of Rho3 in the cell using a plasmid shuffle assay . Complementation of a rho3 deletion was observed by following growth on 5 - FOA – containing me - dia , which selects against a plasmid containing the wild - type RHO3 gene , leaving the indicated RHO3 allele as the sole source of Rho3 in the cell . Although empty vector shows no growth at 30 (cid:1) C , introduction of CEN - RHO3 ( Fig . 9 A , iv , middle ) or activated CEN - RHO3 Q74L ( Fig . 9 A , iv , bottom ) fully complemented the growth defect associated with loss of chro - mosomal rho3 . Moreover , complementation by RHO3 Q74L was Figure 6 . Sec8 - GFP photobleaching and FRAP measurements in rho3 - V51 , sec3 - (cid:1) N cells show wild - type recovery times .

In contrast , the GDP - locked mu - tant RHO3 T30N failed to show any complementation activity . These results demonstrate that all the essential functions of Rho3 in yeast , including regulation of polarized exocytosis , are fulfilled by a GTPase inactive allele . These data suggest that GTP hydrolysis and cycling are not critical to the regulatory functions of Rho3 , which further supports the notion that Rho3 functions primarily through allosteric regulation of its effectors . In contrast to Rho3 , many of the functions of Cdc42 are known to require GTP hydrolysis ( Irazoqui et al . , 2003 ) . To de - termine if the specific role of Cdc42 in exocytosis requires GTP hydrolysis , we examined the ability of a GTPase - deficient allele to complement growth defects associated with various temperature - sensitive mutations in Cdc42 . Because high levels of Cdc42 Q61L protein are known to be lethal to yeast , we made use of a construct that allows production of sublethal amounts of activated CDC42 Q61L from a crippled version of the GAL1 promoter ( Gladfelter et al . , 2002 ) . The thermosensitive mutants of cdc42 were transformed with this construct and then scored for growth under a variety of conditions . We have shown previ - ously that the cdc42 - 6 mutant shows a highly allele - specific defect in exocytosis after shifts to 32 (cid:1) C , but demonstrates pleiotropic polarity defects when shifted to 37 (cid:1) C ( Adamo et al . , 2001 ) . We observed that cdc42 - 6 growth and secretion defects at 32 (cid:1) C were rescued when expression of wild - type CDC42 or CDC42 Q61L was induced on galactose medium ( Fig . 9 B ; un - published data ) . As expected , only wild - type CDC42 was able to complement cdc42 - 6 growth defects at 37 (cid:1) C because the phenotype of this mutant at high temperature resembles that of the pleiotropically defective cdc42 - 1 allele . Consistent with a previous paper ( Irazoqui et al . , 2003 ) , we found that at the re - strictive temperatures GTP - locked Cdc42 was unable to rescue defects in cdc42 - 17 and cdc42 - 27 ( Fig . 9 B , bottom ) or cdc42 - 1 ( not depicted ) , all of which show general defects in Cdc42 - mediated polarity . Together , these results show that GTP - locked Cdc42 specifically rescues the highly allele - specific secretory defect associated with cdc42 - 6 . Hence , both Rho3 and Cdc42 do not require GDP / GTP cycles to regulate exocy - tosis , which is consistent with the allosteric mechanism sug - gested by our phenotypic analysis of rho3 - V51 and cdc42 - 6 .

Based on these results , we suggested that Cdc42 acts as a positive allosteric regulator of the late secretory apparatus at sites of polarized growth . Here , we show that another Rho GTP - ase in yeast , Rho3 , acts in a similar manner to positively regu - late exocytosis independent of any effect in the polarization of the exocytic machinery . Together , these findings suggest a novel mechanism for the action of Rho GTPases in polarized secretion . This new model , depicted in Fig . 10 , is distinct from previous models in which Rho proteins were thought to act in polarization of exocytosis by sequestering components of the secretion machinery at a specific site on the plasma membrane ( Fig . 10 , A and B , top ; Guo et al . , 2001 ; Symons and Rusk , 2003 ) . In this model , a polarized patch of activated Rho GTPase would act directly on the initially unpolarized late secretory ma - chinery ( Fig . 10 , A and B , bottom ) . This localized signal would increase the activity of the machinery and hence the likelihood of a productive secretory vesicle fusion event at a precise site on the membrane . Because many components of the docking and fusion machinery—including the exocyst complex ( Guo et al . , 1999 ; Folsch et al . , 2003 ; Vik - Mo et al . , 2003 ) , Cdc42 , and Rho1 ( Abe et al . , 2003 ; Wedlich - Soldner et al . , 2003 ) —have been found to associate with secretory vesicles and other trans - port intermediates , ongoing allosteric regulation would be ex - pected to lead to the polarization of the secretion apparatus and to a further increase in allosteric activation . According to this view , the polarization of the secretory machinery would then be a consequence , rather than a cause , of ongoing polarized deliv - ery of vesicles to the plasma membrane . Based on this model , Figure 9 . GTP hydrolysis by Rho3 and Cdc42 is not essential for their secretory function . ( A , i ) sec4 - P48 cs phenotype is efficiently suppressed by the activated RHO3 Q74L allele . Wild - type and mutant sec4 - P48 strains were transformed with single - copy ( CEN ) plasmids with the indicated gene , picked into microtiter wells , and transferred onto SC - ura plates at 25 and 14 (cid:1) C . Similar results were obtained on YPD medium . ( ii ) GTP hydrolysis by Rho3 is not necessary for its function in secretion . Centromeric plasmids containing the wild - type or activated alleles of RHO3 were introduced into the secretion - defective mutant rho3 - V51 and wild - type strain . Suppression of cs phenotype was assayed as described for A ( i ) . ( iii ) Constitutively activated Rho3 is a strong suppres - sor of the cdc42 - 6 secretion mutant . RHO3 and RHO3 Q74L centromeric plasmids were transformed into wild - type and cdc42 - 6 cells . Suppression of the growth defect was tested on YPD media at the restrictive temperatures of 32 and 37 (cid:1) C . ( iv ) Complementation of the rho3 deletion by activated RHO3 Q74L . A rho3 (cid:5) strain containing CEN / URA3 / RHO3 plasmid was used in a plasmid shuffle complementation assay . This strain was transformed with an empty CEN / HIS3 plasmid or an identical plasmid containing wild - type RHO3 , activated RHO3 Q74L , or the GDP - blocked mutant RHO3 T30N . Transformants were tested for growth on control ( SD ) plates or 5 - FOA plates , which select against the CEN / URA3 / RHO3 plasmid , to monitor growth of each strain with the CEN / HIS3 plasmid as the sole source of RHO3 in the cell . Plates were grown for 3 d at 30 (cid:1) C . ( B ) GTP hydrolysis by Cdc42 is not necessary for suppression of the cdc42 - 6 secretion defect . GAL1 EG43 plasmid carrying the wild - type or activated ( Q61L ) allele of CDC42 was integrated into the URA3 locus of the wild - type , cdc42 - 6 , cdc42 - 17 , and cdc42 - 27 strains . Empty GAL1 EG43 vector was used as a growth control . Colonies from each transformation were picked into microtiter wells and transferred onto YP plates containing either 2 % glucose or 2 % galactose to repress or induce the EG43 crippled GAL1 promoter , respectively . The cells were then incubated at the permissive temperature ( 25 (cid:1) C ) or at the nonpermissive temperatures ( 32 (cid:1) C and 37 (cid:1) C ) for 2 – 3 d . on A p r il 29 , 2016 j c b . r up r e ss . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m Published August 15 , 2005 JCB • VOLUME 170 • NUMBER 4 • 2005 592 the activated Rho GTPases , rather than their effectors , would serve as the major spatial landmarks for polarized secretion . Previous work on the Sec3 component of the exocyst com - plex has led to the hypothesis that the localization of this protein might serve as a spatial landmark for polarization of vesicle docking and fusion events on the plasma membrane ( Finger et al . , 1998 ) . However , in the current study , we found that polariza - tion of Sec3 , through its NH 2 - terminal RBD , is dispensable for its overall function in the cell , although a positive role for this domain was detected in combination with certain other secretory defective mutants . Indeed , although the NH 2 - terminal RBD do - main is essential for the polarization of Sec3 , localization and function of the exocytic machinery is not dependent on Sec3 po - larization . Our analyses of Sec3 localization using antibodies to examine the localization of native Sec3 suggest that its polariza - tion is determined in the same way as the rest of the exocyst complex . This is in strong agreement with our model for Rho - dependent polarization of exocytosis . It is not presently clear why we see such distinct differences in the polarization of Sec3 to those seen in the previous studies done primarily with GFP - tagged forms of the protein . It is possible that either the presence of the GFP tag itself influences the localization of Sec3 or that our Sec3 antibodies recognize an epitope whose accessibility is sensitive to a conformational change in the protein . Guo et al . ( 2001 ) has suggested that , in the absence of po - larized Sec3 , the rest of the exocyst complex may be polarized through a parallel pathway involving Exo70 . Because Exo70 binds to Rho3 , this interaction could represent a redundant pathway for exocyst localization . We tested this hypothesis di - rectly using an allele of Rho3 that has been shown to be specif - ically defective in interacting with Exo70 . We find no evidence for redundancy between the Rho3 – Exo70 and Rho1 – Sec3 pathways . To exclude an indirect effect due to sec3 - (cid:5) N overex - pression , we performed similar experiments using a strain pro - ducing a wild - type level of Sec3 - (cid:5) N protein as the only source of Sec3 . Again , no redundancy between the two pathways was observed ( unpublished data ) . Thus , we find no evidence to suggest that either Sec3 alone or the exocyst as a whole act as spatial landmarks for exocytosis . Rather , we propose that the exocyst polarization is a consequence of ongoing polarized exocytosis ( Fig . 10 , A and B , bottom ) . Sec3 is the only compo - nent of the exocyst whose localization has been reported to be independent of the secretory pathway and the actin cytoskele - ton ( Finger et al . , 1998 ) . In yeast , the Sec8 and Sec15 subunits are delivered to the plasma membrane through the secretory pathway , and the other exocyst subunits , with the exception of Sec3 , act similarly ( Finger et al . , 1998 ; Guo et al . , 1999 , Boyd et al . , 2004 ) . However , we report here that the mechanism by which Sec3 becomes polarized appears to be similar to that of the other exocyst subunits and involves polarized delivery of vesicles to the plasma membrane . Thus , it is unlikely that ad - ditional interactions between Rho GTPases and the exocyst would be involved in the initial polarization of this complex , but these signals would serve to regulate the assembled com - plex at sites of growth . A prediction of the allostery model is that the function of Rho GTPases in exocytosis would not require GTP hydrolysis , as allosteric regulation is expected to be maximal in the GTP - bound state ( Buck et al . , 2004 ; Peterson et al . , 2004 ) . In support of this model , we found that Rho3 efficiently fulfills its func - tion in exocytosis when locked in a GTP - bound form , as mea - sured by suppression of specific late secretory mutants . In fact , the GTPase - deficient mutant can fulfill all the functions of Rho3 in the cell because it completely rescues a deletion in the gene in a manner that is genetically and morphologically indis - tinguishable from the wild - type RHO3 gene . In contrast , Cdc42 is known to require GTP hydrolysis for many of its functions in the cell , including septin ring assembly and early polarization ( Gladfelter et al . , 2002 ; Irazoqui et al . , 2003 ) . Consistent with this , we and others have found that most cdc42 mutant alleles fail to be rescued by a mutant form of Cdc42 unable to hydro - lyze GTP . In contrast , we found that the cdc42 - 6 allele , which has a very specific defect in exocytosis , is well complemented by a GTPase - deficient form of Cdc42 . These results provide further support for the fact that Rho3 and Cdc42 function in a similar allosteric fashion in the spatial regulation of exocytosis . Overall , our analysis of the rho3 - V51 and cdc42 - 6 mu - tants show that these Rho GTPases regulate secretion indepen - dent of their ability to polarize the exocytic machinery and to Figure 10 . Models for the spatial regulation of exocytosis by Rho GTPases . ( A ) Recruitment model for regulation of exocytosis . A polarized patch of GTP - bound Rho protein would recruit specific components of the exocytic machinery , including the exocyst complex , to a specific site on the plasma membrane . Once polarized , the exocyst complex would act as a spatial landmark for exocytosis , restricting the docking and fusion of post - Golgi vesicles at this site . ( B ) Allostery model for regulation of exocytosis . A po - larized patch of activated Rho GTPase would act directly as a spatial landmark for exocytosis by locally activating the late secretory machinery , including the exocyst complex . This locally activated machinery would in - crease the likelihood of productive docking and fusion at this site . Many components of the exocytic machinery , including Rho GTPases and exo - cyst subunits , have been shown to be associated with secretory vesicles . Therefore , increased exocytosis at sites of allosteric activation would lead to both reinforcement of the activation signal as well as polarization of the exocytic machinery . on A p r il 29 , 2016 j c b . r up r e ss . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m Published August 15 , 2005 RHO GTPASES IN POLARIZED SECRETION • ROUMANIE ET AL . 593 hydrolyze GTP . These observations lead us to propose a model in which Rho proteins work as allosteric regulators of the unpo - larized secretion machinery by activating the fusion of vesicles with the plasma membrane . As a consequence of this activation , components of the secretion machinery , carried on post - Golgi vesicles , would themselves become polarized ( Boyd et al . , 2004 ) . This would be expected to result in the reinforcement of the polarization of this process by a positive feedback mecha - nism . Importantly , this model is applicable to polarization events observed in mammalian cells . In particular , the basolat - eral membrane recruitment of the Sec6 / 8 complex in epithelial cells is known to be a consequence of cell – cell adhesion . The polarized localization of the Sec6 / 8 complex correlates with , but does not precede , the development of polarized transport to the basolateral membrane ( Grindstaff et al . , 1998 ) . In the develop - ing neuron , the polarized patches of Sec6 / 8 observed in the syn - aptic region disappear upon maturation of the synapse ( Hazuka et al . , 1999 ) . This phenomenon may simply reflect a decrease in the delivery of the exocyst components to the membrane , as trafficking strongly decreases after maturation of the synapse . Determining the precise nature of allosteric regulation by Rho3 and Cdc42 on the exocytic machinery and the exocyst will be critical to understanding the molecular mechanism by which Rho proteins regulate polarized secretion . A likely mechanism for allosteric regulation would involve relief of an autoinhibitory interaction similar to that found for the effect of Rho GTPases in regulating the activity of members of the formin family ( Zigmond , 2004 ) . By analogy , binding of the Rho3 GTPase to the RBD of Exo70 ( for example ) would re - lieve an inhibitory interaction within Exo70 or perhaps be - tween Exo70 and another exocyst subunit . The conformational change created by the binding of Rho3 would then promote the ability of this complex to drive downstream events through di - rect effects on SNAREs ( Sivaram et al . , 2005 ) or through an in - termediary ( Lehman et al . , 1999 ) . In either case , the result would be a direct increase in the rate of vesicle docking and fu - sion at sites populated by the activated Rho GTPase . Materials and methods Genetic techniques and yeast strains construction Standard yeast genetic manipulations were performed as described by Guthrie and Fink ( 1991 ) . Cells were grown in complete YP media ( 1 % Bacto yeast extract and 2 % Bacto peptone containing 2 % glucose or ga - lactose ) or in minimal media ( 0 . 67 % yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and 2 % glucose ) supplemented with appropriate metabolites . For all assays performed , 25 (cid:1) C was the permissive temperature , whereas the re - strictive temperature of 14 or 32 (cid:1) C was used to visualize rho3 - V51 and cdc42 - 6 growth defects , respectively . To construct the sec3 - (cid:5) N strain , a region encoding amino acids 321 – 653 of Sec3 was PCR amplified from yeast genomic DNA and cloned into the BamHI and SalI sites of the integrative , HIS3 , pRS303 plas - mid ( Sikorski and Hieter , 1989 ) . A 0 . 7 - kb PCR fragment containing the glyceraldehyde - 3 - phosphate hehydrogenase 3 promoter ( GPD p ) sequence fused to the first two Sec3 codons was ligated into the BamHI and NotI sites . Digestion of the resulting plasmid at the unique PmlI site was used to target integration into the SEC3 gene , and thus create a modified lo - cus expressing truncated sec3 - (cid:5) 3 - 320 under the dependence of GPD p . The PmlI - linearized plasmid was transformed into a diploid wild - type yeast strain ( a / (cid:8) , ura3 - 52 / ura3 - 52 , leu2 - 3 , 112 / leu2 - 3 , 112 , his3 (cid:5) 200 / his3 (cid:5) 200 ) , and his (cid:4) transformants were sporulated . The tetrads were dis - sected on complete media , and the haploid progeny were analyzed by replica plating for the presence of wild - type ( scored as his (cid:7) ) or modified ( scored as his (cid:4) ) SEC3 locus . Correct replacement of wild - type SEC3 locus by GPD p - sec3 - (cid:5) 3 - 320 was further confirmed by immunoblot analysis us - ing anti - Sec3 antibodies directed against the middle region of the protein ( aa 279 – 474 ) . To assay for the genetic interaction between rho3 - V51 and sec3 - (cid:5) N , an integrative plasmid containing the rho3 - V51 allele ( Adamo et al . , 1999 ) was first linearized with PstI and integrated into the URA3 locus of a haploid sec3 - (cid:5) N strain ( a , sec3 : : HIS3 : : GPD p - sec3 - (cid:5) N , ura3 - 52 , leu2 - 3 , 112 , his3 (cid:5) 200 ) . The resulting strain was then crossed to rho3 - V51 ( (cid:8) , ura3 : : rho3 - V51 , rho3 (cid:5) : : LEU2 , leu2 - 3 , 112 , his3 (cid:5) 200 ) , and the diploid cells were sporulated and dissected on complete media . Progeny were an - alyzed for the presence of GPD p - sec3 - (cid:5) N ( scored as his (cid:4) ) and RHO3 de - letion ( scored as leu (cid:4) ) by replica plating and were analyzed for a growth defect at 14 (cid:1) C by dilution assays . Sec3 and Sec3 - (cid:5) N proteins production was monitored by immunoblot analysis using anti - Sec3 antibodies . Wild - type and activated forms of CDC42 expressed from a crip - pled version of the GAL1 ( EG43 ) promoter ( a gift of J . Irazoqui and D . Lew , Duke University , Durham , NC ) were integrated into the URA3 locus of temperature - sensitive cdc42 mutants as previously described ( Gladfelter et al . , 2002 ) . Expression was induced in the presence of galactose and repressed in the presence of glucose in the medium . Immunoblot analysis Western blot analyses were performed on either yeast whole - cell lysates , to detect Sec3 and Exo70 proteins , or on internal / external cellular frac - tions , to analyze Bgl2 secretion . Blots were probed with polyclonal (cid:8) - Sec3 or (cid:8) - Exo70 antibodies at 1 : 1 , 000 dilution or affinity - purified (cid:8) - Bgl2 anti - body diluted 1 : 100 , depending on the experiment . Primary antibodies were detected with radiolabeled 125 I - protein A at 1 : 660 dilution . Quanti - tation of bands was done on a STORM phosphoimager using Image - Quant software ( Molecular Dynamics ) . Invertase and Bgl2 secretion assays Invertase assays were performed as described previously ( Adamo et al . , 1999 ) . Exoglucanase Bgl2 secretion was tested essentially as described previously ( Adamo et al . , 1999 ) . In brief , yeast strains were grown over - night to midlog phase at 25 (cid:1) C in YPD and then either shifted to 14 (cid:1) C for 5 h or kept at 25 (cid:1) C . NaF and NaN 3 were added to a final concentration of 20 mM . 25 ODs of cells were washed in Tris / NaF / NaN3 and sphero - plasted , and the internal and external fractions were separated and boiled in 2 (cid:9) or 6 (cid:9) sample buffers , respectively . Samples were subjected to SDS - PAGE , transferred to nitrocellulose , and probed with affinity - puri - fied (cid:8) - Bgl2 antibody . Immunofluorescence microscopy Cells were grown overnight to mid - log phase and then either fixed imme - diately with 3 . 7 % formaldehyde or shifted to the restrictive temperature . Fixed cells were spheroplasted , permeabilized with 0 . 5 % SDS , and af - fixed to the slides as described previously ( Brennwald and Novick , 1993 ) . The following primary antibodies were incubated for 1 h at RT : Sec4 mAb ( 1 : 100 dilution ) , affinity - purified polyclonal Cdc42 ( 1 : 75 dilution ) , Myo2 ( 1 : 100 dilution ) , Sec3 ( 1 : 50 dilution ) , or Sec15 ( 1 : 100 dilution ) . The sec - ondary antibodies used were FITC - conjugated goat anti – mouse at 1 : 50 di - lution for detection of Sec4 , and rhodamine - conjugated goat anti – rabbit at 1 : 50 dilution for detection of Cdc42 , Myo2 , and Sec3 or at 1 : 100 di - lution for detection of Sec15 ( secondary antibodies were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories ) . After a 1 - h incubation at RT , the slides were washed extensively and mounting media ( 90 % glycerol with 4’ , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole to visualize DNA and o - phenylenediamine to retard photobleaching ) was added . Stained cells were viewed on a mi - croscope ( model E600 ; Nikon ) equipped with a 512 (cid:9) 512 back illumi - nated frame - transfer charge coupled device camera ( Princeton Instru - ments ) and Metamorph software ( Universal Imaging Corp . ) to capture images . Pictures were processed for presentation using Adobe Photoshop . Intensity of fluorescence associated with polarized immunostained proteins was measured in small budded cells using Metamorph software . A minimum of 25 distinct spots from wild - type and mutant cells were measured for each experimental condition , and the average and SD values were de - termined . Result for each marker was then expressed as a fluorescence in - tensity in mutant cells relative to the fluorescence observed in wild type . Visualization of GFP - tagged exocyst components GFP experiments were performed on wild - type or mutant cells transformed with a plasmid containing Sec3 , Sec8 , or Exo70 fused to a single GFP molecule at the COOH - terminal extremity ( Adamo et al . , 2001 ) .

Cells were fixed by a 10 - min treatment in (cid:7) 20 (cid:1) C methanol , washed with acetone at (cid:7) 20 (cid:1) C , and rehydrated by three washes with ice - cold PBS before being observed by a fluorescence microscope . Photobleaching experiments and FRAP analysis Mid - logarithmic Sec8 - GFP cells grown at 32 (cid:1) C in selective media were placed on a slab of selective media supplemented with 25 % gelatin and imaged at RT ( (cid:1) 22 (cid:1) C ) . Photobleaching of Sec8 - GFP was performed on an inverted microscope ( Eclipse TE2000 - U ; Nikon ) equipped with a 1 . 4 NA 100 (cid:9) differential interference contrast ( DIC ) objective . Single focal plane images were captured by a digital camera ( Orca ER ; Hamamatsu ) using a 400 - ms ( ms ) epifluorescence exposure time ( binned 2 (cid:9) 2 ) and a 200 - ms DIC exposure time . Cells were photobleached using the 488 - nm line from a 100 - mW argon laser ( Spectra - Physics ) controlled by a sliding filter cube set ( Conix Research ) . The bud tip signal was photobleached to (cid:1) 25 % of the prebleach fluorescence intensity . The photobleaching exposure time was 50 – 175 ms . During image acquisition , one prebleach data point was recorded , followed by eight data points acquired every 5 s , and then five data points every 20 s . The total imaging time was (cid:1) 140 s . Aperiodic DIC images were also acquired . FRAP measurements were performed as previously described ( Molk et al . , 2004 ) . Online supplemental material Table S1 details the data obtained from the FRAP analysis with Sec8 - GFP . Table S2 shows the synthetic genetic effects of combining the sec3 - (cid:5) N mutant with various rho3 , cdc42 , and late sec mutants .
