As signal strength is often constrained by fundamental limits , background reduction becomes an important approach for improving SBR . We recently reported that a zwitterionic near - infrared ( NIR ) fluorophore , ZW800 - 1 , exhibits low background . Here we show that this fluorophore provides much - improved SBR when targeted to cancer cells or proteins by conjugation with a cyclic RGD peptide , fibrinogen , or antibodies . ZW800 - 1 outperforms the commercially available NIR fluorophores IRDye800 - CW and Cy5 . 5 in vitro for immunocytometry , histopathology and immunoblotting , and in vivo for image - guided surgery . In tumor model systems , tumor - to - background ratios of 17 . 2 are achieved after only 4 h post - injection , compared with 5 . 1 for IRDye800 - CW and 2 . 7 for Cy5 . 5 . Our results suggest that introducing zwitterionic properties into targeted fluorophores may be a general strategy for improving the SBR in diagnostic and therapeutic applications . Near - infrared ( NIR ) fluorophores hold great promise for in vivo imaging because of reduced tissue absorbance , scatter and autofluorescence at NIR wavelengths between 700 and 900 nm ( reviewed in 1 – 3 ) . Two commercially available NIR fluorophores , IRDye 800 - CW ( CW800 ) and Cy5 . 5 , have highly hydrophobic cores surrounded by a shell of highly anionic surface charge . This chemical and geometric configuration results in relatively high nonspecific binding in vitro and in vivo 4 – 6 . When used in vivo , targeted imaging reagents are * Corresponding Author : John V . Frangioni , M . D . , Ph .

Attempts to improve the SBR through background reduction have mainly focused on creating NIR fluorophores whose signal is modified by the local environment . Two of many examples ( reviewed in ref . 8 ) include enzyme - activated fluorescent probes 9 – 12 and pH - sensitive agents that show increased quantum yield after endocytosis and transport to lysosomes 13 , 14 . In both of these cases , a quencher is released leading to increased signal in response to certain proteases or low pH , respectively . However , none of the approaches to date focus on a fundamental limitation of NIR fluorophores , namely , their nonspecific binding , uptake and retention . A complementary approach that is applicable to nearly any targeting molecule is to create NIR fluorophores that exhibit low nonspecific binding and , for in vivo use , are cleared by renal filtration so as to prevent contamination of the gastrointestinal tract . The hypothesis guiding our work is that targeted zwitterionic molecules , molecules containing evenly spaced and interspersed positive and negative charges , might recapitulate the results seen previously with targeted zwitterionic nanoparticles 15 – 18 . In that prior work , zwitterionic surface coatings , but not anionic or cationic coatings , resulted in much lower than expected nonspecific uptake . In a previous study characterizing the properties of NIR fluorophores , we found that the zwitterionic heptamethine indocyanine NIR fluorophore ZW800 - 1 exhibits low serum binding , ultralow nonspecific tissue background and rapid elimination from the body via renal filtration 19 . Moreover , ZW800 - 1 has notable optical properties including high extinction coefficient and quantum yield , ensuring maintenance of a high signal . Here we conjugated the zwitterionic NIR fluorophore ZW800 - 1 to various targeting ligands and compared these with conjugates made using CW800 and Cy5 . 5 , in a broad spectrum of biomedical optical imaging assays . CW800 and Cy5 . 5 were chosen for comparison as they have the best reported performance and highest number of citations in the literature to date . Our results suggest that targeted zwitterionic NIR fluorophores outperform conventional NIR fluorophores in a wide variety of in vitro and in vivo assays . RESULTS Physiochemical properties of targeted NIR fluorophores To create targeted ZW800 - 1 ( emission ≈ 800 nm ) , CW800 ( heptamethine indocyanine with a cyclohexane center that emits at ≈ 800 nm ) and Cy5 . 5 ( linear pentamethine that emits at ≈ 700 nm ) , we covalently conjugated each fluorophore to a cyclic peptide consisting of Arg - Gly - Asp - D - Tyr - Lys ( cRGD ) , which specifically binds integrin α v β 3 ( Fig . 1a ) . ZW800 - 1 was synthesized using a process compatible with good manufacturing practices ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) 20 . Because of the starting anionic charge , cRGD - CW800 and cRGD - Cy5 . 5 exhibited net surface charges of −4 and a highly unbalanced ( i . e . , dipole - like ) charge - to - hydrophobicity distribution over their surfaces . In contrast , cRGD - ZW800 - 1 was very hydrophilic ( logD = −9 . 77 ) , had a net surface charge of 0 and had an extremely well - balanced charge distribution over its surface ( Fig . 1a ) . Molecular modeling ( Fig . 1a ) suggested that the indole nitrogen may be buried after conjugation and thus would not make a notable contribution to surface charge . Choi et al .

N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t Cell binding assays , histology and immunoblotting We next confirmed the specificity of targeted NIR fluorescent ligands to the surface of living cancer cells using human melanoma cell lines . All of the targeted fluorophores bound to α v β 3 - positive M21 cells but not to α v β 3 - negative M21 - L cells ( Fig . 1b ) . However , high background signals from nonspecific binding of cRGD - CW800 and cRGD - Cy5 . 5 were observed in both cell lines , whereas almost no measurable background signal was detected using cRGD - ZW800 - 1 . To determine whether background reduction would also be seen when using large protein - targeting ligands , we conjugated NIR fluorophores to a secondary antibody ( see Supplementary Methods ) and tested the NIR fluorescent antibody conjugates on breast cancer cells . Her2 overexpressing MDA - MB - 361 breast cancer cells showed specific membrane binding with all three antibody - NIR conjugates ( Fig . 1c ) ; however , notably higher background signals were observed in the Her2 negative MDA - MB - 231 cells when using secondary antibodies conjugated to CW800 or Cy5 . 5 . In addition , cells stained with only the secondary antibody conjugated to Cy5 . 5 showed strong nonspecific binding in both breast cancer cell lines . In histopathology , the gold standard for diagnosing many human diseases , it is difficult to obtain adequate SBR because many antigens are in low abundance or are not highly concentrated . To compare the performance of the three NIR fluorophores for immunostaining , we conjugated each one to an antibody and used it to stain tissue sections ( Fig . 2 , Supplementary Fig . 3 , Supplementary Table 1 ) . Resected human tumor - containing tissues from prostatectomies ( Fig . 2a ) and mastectomies ( Fig . 2b ) were fixed , frozen and consecutively cryosectioned for alternating NIR fluorescence and hematoxylin and eosin ( H & E ) staining . Using primary antibodies specific for the tumor of interest , an unlabeled secondary antibody for amplification and NIR fluorophore - labeled tertiary antibodies , malignant cells could be readily identified . However , antibodies conjugated to CW800 or Cy5 . 5 demonstrated notable nonspecific background binding even when used at a fluorophore to antibody ratio of 1 . 2 . Increasing the labeling ratio to 2 . 5 ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) increased background even further , despite the presence of 0 . 1 % nonionic detergent and 0 . 1 % albumin in all solutions . Immunoblotting is often used to confirm the presence of target protein in a complex biological sample . By using NIR fluorescent light , background signals from autofluorescence and light scattering of membranes could be greatly reduced . However , challenges and limitations remain with respect to sensitivity and quantitation . The zwitterionic antibody conjugate improved SBR by lowering nonspecific membrane staining and / or eliminating false - positive bands ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . Tumor targeting and image - guided surgery Achieving an adequate tumor - to - background ratio ( TBR ; the CBR from the tumor divided by the CBR from nearby normal tissue ) , contrast - to - background ratio ( CBR ; ( signal - system background ) / system background ) , and positive - to - negative tumor ratio ( PNR ; signal from receptor - positive tumor divided by the signal from a receptor - negative tumor in the same animal ) is challenging for most targeted contrast agents . Using a xenograft mouse model containing transplanted human melanoma cells ( T + ; tumor from α v β 3 - positive M21 cell line vs . T − ; tumor from α v β 3 - negative M21 - L cell line ) , we compared the performance of the 3 NIR - conjugated cRGD ligands . After intravenous administration of 100 pmol / g of each NIR - conjugated cRGD into tumor - bearing mice , TBR and SBR of the α v β 3 - positive xenografts increased over a 4 h observation period . The highest TBR ( 17 . 2 ± 1 . 2 ) , SBR ( 5 . 1 ± 0 . 7 ) and PNR ( 4 . 2 ± 0 . 9 ) at 4 h post - injection were achieved using cRGD - ZW800 - 1 ( Fig . 3a ) . With both cRGD - CW800 and cRGD - Cy5 . 5 , the signal in the α v β 3 - positive tumors was similar to those from cRGD - ZW800 - 1 , as expected because affinity , extinction coefficient Choi et al .

N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t and quantum yield are similar . However , background in non - tumor tissues and receptor - negative tumors were much higher than those seen with cRGD - ZW800 - 1 ( TBR = 5 . 1 ± 1 . 2 and 2 . 7 ± 1 . 4 ; SBR = 2 . 6 ± 0 . 2 and 1 . 4 ± 0 . 2 ; PNR = 2 . 1 ± 1 . 0 and 1 . 4 ± 1 . 1 for cRGD - CW800 and cRGD - Cy5 . 5 , respectively ) indicative of lower specificity and selectivity . After 4 h , washout from the tumors occurred . Although background decreased , TBR was 4 . 8 , 2 . 0 and 1 . 3 for cRGD - ZW800 - 1 , cRGD - CW800 and cRGD - Cy5 . 5 , respectively by 24 h ( Supplementary Fig . 5a ) . Image - guided surgical resection of major tissues and organs at 4 h revealed extremely low uptake in normal tissues and organs with cRGD - ZW800 - 1 ( Supplementary Fig . 5b ) . The signal seen in skin with cRGD - ZW800 - 1 is likely due to the normal expression of integrins in skin 21 . In addition , cRGD - ZW800 - 1 was eliminated from the body exclusively via renal filtration and was unchanged in urine when analyzed by mass spectrometry , while less than 30 % of the other targeted agents were found in urine at 4 h post - injection ( data not shown ) . We next tested these NIR - conjugated cRGD ligands in liver and lung metastatic tumor models because small metastasestumors are difficult to detect wherever nonspecific background is high . Fluorescence signal intensities at the target tumor were similar using each of the three targeted NIR ligands ( Fig . 3b ) . However , cRGD - ZW800 - 1 expressed almost no background fluorescence in liver and lung tissues , whereas cRGD - CW800 showed high background in the thoracic wall , abdominal wall and liver , and cRGD - Cy5 . 5 resulted in elevated background in most tissues including lung , liver , gallbladder , abdominal wall and thoracic wall . The highly saturated signal from stomach is due to autofluorescence at 700 nm . The identification of occult bleeding ( i . e . , fibrinogen - positive thrombi ) in real - time could permit surgeons to intervene intraoperatively to repair damaged tissue . Thus we tested the ability of NIR - labeled fibrinogen ( FBG ; FBG - ZW800 - 1 , FBG - CW800 , and FBG - Cy5 . 5 ; Supplementary Fig . 6 ) to visualize blot clots in mouse models of bleeding in the stomach ( Fig . 3c ) and mesenteric vessels ( Fig . 3c and Supplementary Fig . 6b ) 22 . Because the labeling ratio of fluorophores to fibrinogen is similar ( ≈ 2 . 5 ) , similar fluorescence intensities were observed in all of the injected animals . However , the intensity of background signal was notably different . FBG - ZW800 - 1 accumulated rapidly at the site of thrombus formation and achieved an optimal CBR within 60 min post - injection likely owing to rapid blood clearance of FBG and low nonspecific uptake . In contrast , almost no background reduction was achieved over the same time course by FBG - CW800 . Because of autofluorescence at 700 nm , the CBR of FBG - Cy5 . 5 remained low throughout the entire time course . Overall , the lower background of FBG - ZW800 - 1 , compared to FBG - CW800 and FBG - Cy5 . 5 , contributed to 2 - to 5 - fold higher CBR at 1 h post - injection in both mucosal and mesenteric sites . Control fluorophores without fibrinogen showed no accumulation at any injury site ( data not shown ) . DISCUSSION Surgery is the mainstay of cancer treatment , contributing to the cure of approximately half of all patients diagnosed annually . Although many cancer - targeted contrast agents have been described in the literature and some are available commercially , none perform optimally in vivo owing to high nonspecific background . Similarly , in vitro diagnostics , such as cell - based assays , histopathology and immunoblotting , are often hampered by high background and , therefore , a relatively low SBR . The only two ways to improve SBR during optical imaging are to raise the signal or lower the background . However , for antigen - targeted NIR fluorophores , there is a fundamental limit to signal strength because of the relatively low number of binding sites and intrinsic properties of the fluorophore such as the extinction coefficient , quantum yield , and excitation fluence rate . Although amplification can be used Choi et al . Page 4 Nat Biotechnol . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2014 February 01 . N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t to raise low signals for in vitro diagnostics , amplification during in vivo imaging is often complex and clinically unrealistic . Our study focused on improving SBR by lowering background . Even though the NIR window of 700 – 900 nm provides relatively high photon transmission and relatively low autofluorescence , nonspecific binding and / or uptake of conventional NIR fluorophores is the major problem impeding the field . We describe reagents for quantitatively imaging metastatic tumors during surgery , cells on a microscope slide , or bands on an immunoblot with much less background signal than seen when using conventional NIR fluorophores . Two key findings warrant highlighting . First , the physicochemical structure of a relatively small NIR fluorophore can substantially degrade the performance of both small and large targeting molecules . As shown in Figure 4 , when a primary amine is conjugated to a tetra - sulfonated molecule , the single positive charge present at physiological pH is replaced by 3 net negative charges , which can disrupt local protein folding , alter the isoelectric point of the molecule and increase nonspecific binding to cationic surfaces . In a zwitterionic fluorophore , however , the amino acid residue has the same net charge with which it started . Because of the implications of this observation , we tested two different chemical classes of NIR fluorophores in parallel as well as targeting ligands spanning the entire spectrum from small molecules to large proteins . This phenomenon was also seen in cell - based assays , histopathological immunostaining , immunoblotting , in vivo tumor imaging and image - guided surgery , suggesting that it is , indeed , a general phenomenon . Although the precise mechanism by which zwitterionic structure lowers background is not known , previous studies suggest a combination of charge shielding 23 , 24 and minimization of membrane penetration 25 , 26 . Second , the strategy of using small , polyionic yet net - neutral molecules with geometrically balanced charge for in vivo imaging leads to clearance exclusively through the kidney and complete elimination of unbound dose from the body into the urine ( Supplementary Fig . 5 ) . This observation could be important not only in optical imaging but also in diagnostic imaging and drug design . Zwitterionic radiometal chelators or zwitterionic fluorinated ( or other radiolabeled ) ligands could reduce background and improve the SBR in positron emission tomography ( PET ) and single - photon emission computed tomography ( SPECT ) imaging . It should be noted that both PET and SPECT technology is already capable of detecting tumors over ten - fold smaller than those imaged clinically today , but cannot achieve this potential because of the high background of conventional radiotracers 27 . Similarly , therapeutic molecules , such as membrane - targeted radiotherapeutics and cytotoxins , could achieve a wider therapeutic window if nonspecific binding to normal cells were avoided through the introduction of zwitterionic chemical structure . One potential problem with this general strategy for small molecules is that blood half - life might sometimes be too short for adequate target contact when using low - affinity ligands . This can be corrected with an inert bulking domain such as polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) . Species - specific blood elimination rates are also important . In previous studies 19 , 20 , blood half - life and renal clearance of zwitterionic NIR fluorophores were proportional to glomerular filtration rate . Because pigs and humans have similar glomerular filtration rates 28 , it is likely that the urine elimination rates seen in pig will be similar to those seen in human models . ZW800 - 1 is named “−1” because a final net charge of 0 is achieved after conjugation to a ligand with a “−1” residual charge 19 . NBT : ZW800 - 1 loses a carboxylate ( - 1 ) after formation of the amide bond , leaving the indole nitrogen ( + 1 ) as the net charge . If the ligand , after conjugation through its amine , has a −1 charge , then the entire molecule is now Choi et al . Page 5 Nat Biotechnol . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2014 February 01 . N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t net zero . However , we believe that the delocalized , positively - charged indolium may be buried within the hydrophobic core of the molecule ( Fig . 1a ) and may not contribute to surface charge in some configurations . In such a case , balanced net surface charge may be the dominant predictor of low background adsorption and uptake . A fundamental question arising from our data is whether geometrical balance of charge over the entire surface of a targeted molecule is necessary . That is , would a molecule having polyionicity and net - neutrality but separation of charge in a more dipole - like geometry exhibit the properties of low nonspecific binding and uptake in vitro and in vivo ? Ongoing studies aim to answer this question and to develop a mathematical model for predicting targeted ligand performance based on physicochemical parameters . In addition to improving the sensitivity and specificity of fluorescence - based in vitro diagnostics , our study is likely to improve image - guided surgery , especially image - guided cancer surgery . In a well - designed optical system , NIR fluorescence has the potential to see collections of tumor cells on the surface of a tissue ( i . e . , margin positivity ) as small as 100 cells or fewer . This level of tumor cell detection is currently only available using postoperative histopathological analysis , which typically takes 3 – 5 working days to reveal whether margins are positive . An ultralow background and concomitantly higher SBR is the only way to achieve this theoretical level of cancer cell detection . First - in - human clinical trials of ZW800 - 1 are in process . From the small - and large - animal data already analyzed , it appears that the dose of targeted zwitterionic NIR fluorophores in humans will fall into an acceptably low range . When dose is scaled by body surface area , which we have found to be the best scaling factor for targeted NIR fluorophores 29 , 30 , 100 pmol / g of ZW800 - 1 in a 20 g mouse ( 2 nmol ) is equivalent to a human dose of ≈ 0 . 43 mg . This is 58 - fold lower than the typical vial size of indocyanine green ( 25 mg ) , the only FDA - approved 800 nm fluorophore for use in vivo . This calculation suggests that ZW800 - 1 – targeted small molecules will have reasonable human dosing . Because ZW800 - 1 was engineered to have a single carboxylic acid that facilitates stable amide bond formation to amine - containing targeting ligands , one - step ‘modular chemistry for producing cancer - specific , small molecule diagnostic agents 31 , as well as one - step conjugation to antibodies and other targeting biomolecules , is possible . ONLINE METHODS Preparation of NIR Fluorophore Conjugates Cyclic pentapeptide cyclo ( Arg - Gly - Asp - D - Tyr - Lys ; cRGDyK ; MW 619 . 6 ) was synthesized as previously reported 16 , 32 , and conjugated to NIR fluorophores ZW800 - 1 ( available through the nonprofit FLARE Foundation ; www . theflarefoundation . org ) , CW800 ( IRDye800 CW , Li - COR , Lincoln , NE ) , or Cy5 . 5 ( GE Healthcare , Piscataway , NJ ) using N - hydroxysuccinimide ester ( NHS ) chemistry in DMSO . NIR fluorophores were also conjugated to secondary or tertiary IgG ( Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories , West Grove , PA ) and fibrinogen ( FBG ; MP Biomedicals , Irvine , CA ) in PBS , pH 7 . 8 , followed by purification by gel filtration chromatography . In silico calculations of the partition coefficient ( logD ) and surface molecular charge and hydrophobicity were calculated using MarvinSketch 5 . 2 . 1 by taking major microspecies at pH 7 . 4 ( ChemAxon , Budapest , Hungary ) . See Supplementary Methods and Table S1 for detailed chemical conjugation and analyses . Live Cell Binding Assay Cells were purchased from ATCC ( Manassas , VA , USA ) and grown in DMEM or RPMI 1640 ( Mediatech , Hermdon , VA ) supplemented with 10 % FBS and gentamicin ( 50 mg / mL ) Choi et al .

Cells were seeded onto sterilized 18 mm diameter glass coverslips in 12 - well plates ( 3×10 5 cells per well ) , and incubated at 37°C for 60 min in the presence of 2 to 20 μ M targeted NIR fluorophores . After washing , the slides were observed on a 4 - channel NIR fluorescence microscope ( see Supplementary Methods ) . NIR Immunocytochemistry and Immunohistochemistry The human breast cancer cell lines MDA - MB - 361 and MDA - MB - 231 were fixed with 2 % paraformaldehyde and incubated in 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 in PBS ( PBSt ) for 10 min . Cells were blocked in 5 % goat serum for 10 min and incubated with 10 μ g / mL of rabbit anti - human polyclonal antibody c - erbB - 2 oncoprotein ( Dako ) in PBSt for 2 h . The slides were incubated with 20 nM NIR fluorophore - conjugated goat anti - rabbit secondary antibody ( labeling ratio ≈ 1 . 2 ) in PBSt for 1 h . After a second fixation step with 2 % paraformaldehyde in PBS , membrane NIR fluorescence was analyzed using a multichannel Nikon TE300 fluorescence microscope ( see Supplementary Methods ) . For immunohistochemistry , tissues from prostate and breast biopsies were deparaffinized using a Leica autostainer , followed by antigen retrieval . All incubation and washes were in 0 . 1 % Tween - 20 and 0 . 1 % porcine serum albumin in PBS , pH 7 . 4 ( PBSta ) . The primary AMACR antibody ( Dako ) and c - erbB - 2 oncoprotein ( Her2 ) antibody ( Dako ) were used for the prostate and breast biopsies , respectively . An unlabeled goat anti - rabbit secondary antibody was incubated for 1 h at room temperature , followed by incubation with the conjugated tertiary antibodies for 1 h at a 250 nM concentration . Antibody conjugates were fixed in place with 2 % paraformaldehyde , and the tissues were mounted on microscopy slides . Animals and Tumor Models Animals were housed in an AAALAC - certified facility , and all animal studies were performed under the supervision of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee ( IACUC ) in accordance with approved institutional protocol # 155 - 2008 . For the tumor targeting study , 6 - week - old ( 20 – 30 g ) male hairless athymic nu / nu mice were purchased from Taconic Farms ( Germantown , NY ) . M21 cells ( 2×10 6 ) and M21 - L cells ( 5×10 6 ) resuspended in 100 μ L of Matrigel ( BD Bioscience , Bedford , MA ) were injected subcutaneously in the left and right flank , respectively . For xenograft tumor models metastatic to liver , Lewis lung carcinoma ( LLC ; ATCC ) cells ( 1×10 6 ) without Matrigel were administered into athymic nu / nu mice through a slow ( 1 – 2 min ) intrahepatic injection . For xenograft tumor models metastatic to lung , LLC cells ( 2×10 6 ) were administered intratracheally as previously reported 14 . For tumor imaging , 2 – 10 nmol of NIR - conjugated cRGD in saline was administered intravenously into tumor - bearing mice 4 h prior to imaging . For intraoperative thrombus detection , Sprague - Dawley ( SD ) male rats weighing 250 to 300 g were purchased from Charles River Laboratories ( Wilmington , MA ) . Prior to surgery , animals were anesthetized with 100 mg / kg ketamine and 10 mg / kg xylazine intraperitoneally ( Webster Veterinary , Fort Devens , MA ) . 1 . 2 mg FBG conjugates ( 10 nmol of NIR fluorophore ) was injected intravenously in SD rats 30 min after mucosal resection or mesenteric vessel injury , when no active bleeding was present . For controls , the same dose of unconjugated fluorophores with a carboxylic acid form was injected . Intraoperative Imaging and Statistical Analyses Animals were imaged using FLARE™ imaging system as described in detail previously 2 , 33 . At each time point , the fluorescence ( FL ) and background ( BG ) intensity of a region of interest ( ROI ) over each organ / tissue was quantified using custom FLARE™ software . The contrast - to - background ratio ( CBR ) was calculated as CBR = ( FL – BG ) / BG , where BG is the Choi et al . Page 7 Nat Biotechnol . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2014 February 01 .

All NIR fluorescence images for a particular fluorophore were normalized identically for all conditions of an experiment . That is , for each NIR fluorophore , the image with the strongest signal was optimized for brightness , contrast , and gamma ( BCG ) then these settings were applied to all other images acquired using that particular fluorophore . For tumor - bearing animals , the tumor - to - background ratio ( TBR ) was measured using an ROI over the tumor for FL and an ROI over the skin for BG . The positive - to - negative tumor ratio ( PNR ) was measured using an ROI over the receptor - positive tumor for FL , and the same size and shape ROI over the receptor - negative tumor for BG . At least 5 animals were analyzed at each time point . Statistical analysis was carried out using a one - way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons test . Results were presented as mean ± S .
