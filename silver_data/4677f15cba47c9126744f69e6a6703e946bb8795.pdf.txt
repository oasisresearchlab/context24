NATURE MEDICINE • VOLUME 9 • NUMBER 1 • JANUARY 2003 123 REVIEW With the completion of several genome sequences , the next crucial step is to un - derstand the function of gene products and their role in the development of dis - ease . This knowledge will potentially facilitate the discovery of informative biomarkers that can be used for the earliest detec - tion of disease and for the creation of new classes of drugs di - rected at new therapeutic targets . Thus , one of the capabilities most highly sought after is the noninvasive visualization of specific molecular targets , pathways and physiological effects in vivo . Revolutionary advances in fluorescent probes , photo - proteins and imaging technologies have allowed cell biologists to carry out quantitative examination of cell structure and function at high spatial and temporal resolution . Indeed , whole - cell assays have become an increasingly important tool in screening and drug discovery . The rapid adaptation of these tools and the development of new tools for imaging in deep tis - sues in live animals is currently changing how we visualize molecular processes in vivo and , ultimately , clinically . The pri - mary facilitating technologies have been progress in mathe - matically modeling of photon propagation in tissue , expanding availability of biologically compatible near - infrared ( NIR ) probes and the development of highly sensitive photon - detection technologies . In this article , we briefly review recent advances in macroscopic optical molecular imaging technolo - gies , with a special focus on potential clinical applications . Optical imaging techniques have used different physical pa - rameters of light interaction with tissue ( Table 1 ) . Surface and multispectral images have been used to assess epithelial tissue structure and physiology 1 – 3 , brain function 4 , 5 or superficial redox potential 6 . Probing of hemoglobins deeper in tissue has been used in functional transillumination or reflectance imag - ing 7 , 8 or diffuse optical tomography 9 – 14 . Other techniques have exploited light polarization 15 or light interference 16 , 17 . With these techniques collectively , image signal is primarily a func - tion of ‘internal contrast’ , and is often limited in information content ( the analogy would be microscopy without stains ) . Two more recent techniques , however , are rapidly gaining in popularity , because they impart molecular specificity to in vivo imaging technologies : fluorescence and luminescence imag - ing . In fluorescence imaging , the energy from an external source of light is absorbed and almost immediately re - emitted at a longer , lower - energy wavelength . Fluorescence imaging can be done at different resolutions and depth penetrations , ranging from micrometers ( intravital microscopy ) to centime - ters ( fluorescence molecular tomography , FMT ) ( Table 1 ) . In lu - minescence imaging , light is produced from a chemical reaction without an excitation light ( in contrast to the absorp - tion of photons in fluorescence ) . Bioluminescence is a subset of chemiluminescence , in which the light - producing chemical re - action occurs inside an organism . Irrespective of the mode of signal generation , systems suitable for use in vivo are those that employ compounds and reactions with high quantum yields that emit in the NIR wavelength range ( Fig . 1 ) . Imaging in the near - infrared Light in the visible - wavelength range is routinely used for con - ventional and intravital microscopy 18 . One of the key strategies for imaging deeper tissues ( that is , more than a few millimeters inside the sample ) has been the use of NIR light . This is because hemoglobin ( the principal absorber of visible light ) and water and lipids ( the principal absorbers of infrared light ) have their lowest absorption coefficient in the NIR region of around 650 – 900 nm ( Fig . 1 ) . Imaging in the NIR region has also the added advantage of minimizing tissue autofluorescence , which can further improve target / background ratios 19 ( see Fig . 1 , in - sert ) . Interpretation of NIR data and images generally requires advanced data processing techniques to account for the diffuse nature of photon propagation in tissue . Several fluorescence - based imaging techniques are available ( Table 1 ) . For a review of intravital microscopy see several excel - lent recent review articles 18 , 20 , 21 . Macroscopic fluorescence re - flectance imaging ( FRI ) is a useful technique when probing superficial structures ( < 5 mm deep ) , for example during en - doscopy 22 , 23 , dermatological imaging 3 , intraoperative imaging 24 , probing tissue autofluorescence 25 , 26 or small animal imaging 27 . Fluorescence molecular tomography is the newest imaging tech - nology that has recently been shown to localize and quantify flu - orescent probes three - dimensionally in deep tissues at high sensitivities 28 , 29 ( Fig . 2 ) . Indeed it has become possible to image ( and , importantly , to quantify ) fluorochrome concentrations 30 , 31 and ( de ) quenching at millimeter resolutions 28 ( Fig . 3 ) . In the near future , FMT techniques are expected to improve considerably in spatial resolution by employing higher - density measurements and advanced photon technologies , such as modulated - intensity light or a very short photon pulse . In addition , important gains are expected when the technique is combined with anatomic to - mographic imaging methods such as computed X - ray tomogra - phy ( CT ) or magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , using the latter information for more accurate reconstructions and for projecting molecular maps onto anatomic maps . Clinical FMT imaging ap - plications will ultimately require highly efficient photon collec - tion systems , but penetration depths of 7 – 14 cm are theoretically achievable depending on tissue type . Near - infrared fluorochromes and reporter probes A variety of targeted ( NIR fluorochrome attached to affinity lig - and ) and activatable imaging probes ( based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer , FRET ) have recently been developed ( Table 2 ) . These probes have largely been used to detect early cancers or inflammatory processes in mouse models . In the fu - ture , however , many of these probes could be developed into clinical imaging agents . Optical sensing of specific molecular targets and pathways deep inside living mice has become possible as a result of a number of advances . These include design of biocompatible near - infrared fluorochromes , development of targeted and activatable ‘smart’ imaging probes , engineered photoproteins and advances in photon migration theory and reconstruction . Together , these advances will provide new tools making it possible to understand more fully the functioning of protein networks , diagnose disease earlier and speed along drug discovery .

A variety of reporter probes have been used for enhanced detection of early cancers , including somato - statin receptor – targeted probes 32 – 34 , folate receptor – targeted agents 35 , tumor cell – targeted agents 36 – 39 , agents that incorporate into areas of calcification , bone formation or both 40 , and agents being activated by tumor - associated proteases 41 – 43 . Many of these agents accumulate in ( and thus enhance ) tumors to a certain de - gree ; however , FRET - based agents can yield particularly high tumor / background signal ratios because of their nondetectabil - ity in the native state . For example , recent work has shown that highly dysplastic tumoral precursors are readily detectable by targeting cathepsin B ( ref . 23 ) , a protease capable of activating a model reporter ( Table 2 ) . In this particular study , the sensitivity and specificity of optical detection of intestinal polyps were each > 95 % . Similar approaches may be particularly useful for early en - doscopic detection and characterization of polypoid lesions as well as laparoscopic detection of residual or recurrent tumors such as ovarian cancer . These probes have also been used to de - tect host response , inflammation and invasion ( Fig . 3 ) . Assessment of molecular therapy . One particularly interesting applica - tion of enzyme - activatable imaging agents has been to use them as tools for objective target assessment of new therapeutic agents . In one study , the efficacy of a matrix met - alloproteinase - 2 ( MMP - 2 ) inhibitor at varying dosing and timing was assessed with an MMP - 2 - targeted imaging probe 44 . Small molecule – induced target inhibition could be externally imaged as shortly as 8 h after therapeutic drug administra - tion . It is clear that other classes of imaging agents will be developed to image the growing array of different drug targets . Clinical imaging . Indocyanine green ( ICG ) , an NIR fluorochrome , is approved for clinical retinal an - giography and liver function test - ing 45 . It is a safe imaging agent , having been used in tens of thou - sands of patients with a reported side effect rate of < 0 . 15 % , an extremely favorable index as compared with other reporter agents 46 . In addition , it has been used in at least one clinical study as an absorber ( not a fluo - rochrome ) for enhanced tumor detection 31 . Near - infrared fluo - rochromes with improved biophysical properties ( solubility , quantum yield , stability , synthetic yield , conjugatability ) have recently been developed 47 – 49 and open new avenues for high - efficiency labeling of affinity molecules . Before they can enter routine clinical use , however , these fluorochromes will need to undergo testing and receive approval from the US Food and Drug Administration .

The absorption coefficient of light in tissue is dependent on wavelength and results from absorbers such as hemoglobins , lipids and water . The graph is calculated assuming nor - mally oxygenated tissue ( saturation of 70 % ) , a hemoglobin concentra - tion of 50 mM , and a composition of 50 % water and 15 % lipids . The graph also lists the emission range of several common fluorochromes and luciferases used for imaging . The insert shows autofluorescence spectra obtained in vivo at different excitation wavelengths ( obtained from ref . 84 ) . The excitation range , denoted as λ x , is from 337 to 610 nm , and the emission range ( λ m ) is from 360 to 750 nm . Note the much lower tissue autofluorescence at longer wavelengths . The mouse images at the bot - tom show experimentally measured photon counts through the body of a nude mouse at 532 nm ( left ) and 670 nm ( right ) . The excitation source was a point illumination placed on the posterior chest wall . Signal in the NIR range is ∼ 4 orders of magnitude stronger for illumination in the NIR compared with illumination with green light under otherwise identical conditions , illustrating the advantages for imaging with NIR photons . © 2003 N a t u r e P ub li s h i ng G r oup h tt p : / / www . n a t u r e . c o m / n a t u r e m e d i c i n e NATURE MEDICINE • VOLUME 9 • NUMBER 1 • JANUARY 2003 125 REVIEW Fluorescent proteins Fluorescent proteins offer another possibility for extracting molecular information in small animals but have a less defined role in clinical applications . The green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) from the jellyfish Aequorea victoria was one of the first fluorescent proteins to be used for in vivo imaging . A drawback of GFP is its low emis - sion wavelength ( ∼ 510 nm ) , which overlaps with the autofluorescence of many tissues . This is one of the reasons that mutants of GFP with red - shifted emission have been engineered , but the maximum shift attained is only ∼ 25 nm . With any GFP , imaging is limited to a few millimeters ( Fig . 1 ) . More recently , a new red fluorescent protein ( DsRed ) that emits fluorescence at 583 nm has been isolated from tropical Discosoma corals 50 . Another red fluorescent protein that is potentially even more suitable for in vivo imaging is HcRed , generated by site - directed and random mutagene - sis of a nonfluorescent chromoprotein isolated from the reef coral Heteractis crispa , which emits light at 618 nm 51 , 52 . Unlike bioluminescent pro - teins ( discussed below ) , fluorescent proteins do not require cofactors or chemical staining before in vivo imaging . Much like small - molecule fluo - rochromes , red fluorescent proteins can be im - aged quantitatively in deep tissues by FMT imaging . The ability to quantify fluorescence ac - curately and repeatedly will be essential in differ - ent biological applications . Currently one of the main imaging applica - tions of fluorescent proteins is in monitoring tumor growth 53 , 54 and metastasis formation 55 , 56 , as well as occasionally gene expression 57 . Although GFP imaging of surface tumors is feasible and experimentally useful , deep - seated tumors and organ structures have to be accessed surgi - cally for observation . For this reason , serial bioluminescence imaging of tumor burden , metastasis formation and gene ex - pression has become more widespread . GFP - expressing tumors are particularly useful for intravital microscopy because they Table 2 Selected optical imaging probes Reporter Comment Enzyme - activatable fluorochromes Cathepsin B Cancer and inflammation marker Cathepsin K Osteoclasts Cathepsin D Cancer progression Prostate - specific antigen ( PSA ) Prostate cancer Matrix metalloproteinases ( MMP - 2 , - 9 , - 13 ) Cancer Cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) Infection Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) protease Infection Herpes simplex virus ( HSV ) protease Infection Thrombin Thrombosis Caspase - 1 Apoptosis Caspase - 3 Apoptosis Targeted fluorochromes Phosphatidylserine Apoptosis Somatostatin receptor Cancer Anti - tumor monoclonal antibody Cancer Hydroxyapatite ( HA ) Calcification Glucose transporter Cancer Folate receptor Cancer Fluorescent proteins Green fluorescence proteins ( GFPs ) 480 – 510 nm DsRed ( from Discosoma ) 520 – 580 nm HcRed ( from Heteractis crispa ) 600 – 650 nm Bioluminescent proteins Firefly luciferase + benzothiazole luciferin 560 – 610 nm emission , high QY Renilla reniformis luciferase + coelenterazine 460 – 490 nm , lower QY See text for references .

FMT is a relatively new to - mographic imaging technique based on the use of target - specific molec - ular fluorescent reporters and volumetric reconstruction of light emitted from the probes . The imaging technique involves principles similar to X - ray CT but uses a theoretical mainframe that accounts for the diffuse na - ture of photons in tissues . a , As a single point source illuminates into tissue , the photon field will distribute as shown ( isocontour lines ) , and excite a given distribution of fluorochromes in tissues . b , In each illumi - nation position , the fluorochromes act as secondary sources at a higher wavelength , with an intensity that depends on the position of the light source . Excitation and fluorescence light are both collected from multi - ple points of the surface , using appropriate filters . The source then ro - tates around the boundary , effectively illuminating the fluorochrome distributions at different projections . c , The measurements are tomo - graphically combined to yield quantitative maps of 3 - dimensional ( 3D ) fluorochrome distribution . Although the examples presented are shown in 2 dimensions only , photons propagate 3 - dimensionally and thus FMT imaging is by nature 3D . d , An example of a cylindrical FMT imaging sys - tem for mouse imaging . Excitation ( blue ) and collection fibers ( black ) are arranged around an optical bore to deliver and collect light . FMT cur - rently can detect nanomolar concentrations of fluorochromes at spatial resolutions of 1 – 2 mm in the case of small animals . Considerable pene - tration depths ( several centimeters ) can be achieved in the NIR . e , Modeling of the distance that NIR light can propagate into different tis - sues before it attenuates by an order of magnitude . Fluorochromes can be detected up to several logs of attenuations , that is , in up to 7 – 14 cm depth . a b c d e © 2003 N a t u r e P ub li s h i ng G r oup h tt p : / / www . n a t u r e . c o m / n a t u r e m e d i c i n e 126 NATURE MEDICINE • VOLUME 9 • NUMBER 1 • JANUARY 2003 REVIEW allow clean separation between tumor and host cells 43 , 58 . Fluorescent proteins have also been used as reporters to image gene promoter activity 58 . Because hemoglobin is an efficient light absorber , GFP - expressing tumors have been used to image angiogenesis , as vessels are contrasted against fluores - cent tumor background 59 . Bioluminescence imaging Bioluminescence imaging has emerged as a useful and comple - mentary experimental imaging technique for small animals . Because of its simplicity and ease of generating luc / lux cells , its primary uses have been for tracking tumor cells , stem cells , im - mune cells and bacteria as well as for imaging gene expression . In contrast to fluorescence techniques , there is no inherent background with bioluminescence , which makes this tech - nique highly sensitive . The main limitation has been that the method currently does not allow absolute quantification of tar - get signal . Rather , its primary uses are either in binary mode ( yes / no luc expression ) or as an imaging tool to follow the same animal under identical conditions , including positioning . The imaging signal also depends on ATP , O 2 , depth and the pres - ence of excess substrate , which is administered exogenously . The names ‘luciferin’ and ‘luciferase’ are generic terms for the active agents ( substrate and enzyme , respectively ) in bioluminescent organisms 60 . Numerous examples of biolumi - nescence exist in nature , most notably the flashes of light emitted by the male firefly ( Photinus pyralis ) . Other examples include light emission by various marine organisms such as sponges , corals , jellyfish , clams and a few types of fish . Firefly luciferin ( a benzothia - zole ) and P . pyralis luciferase are the most commonly used substrate - enzyme pairs for in vivo imaging 61 – 64 because of their high wave - length and quantum yield ( Table 2 ) . More re - cently , imaging using Renilla reniformis luciferin and coelenterazine in mice has also been reported 65 . Firefly luciferin normally produces light at 562 nm , although mutants of firefly luciferase that produce red - shifted emissions have been described . Typical doses of luciferin are in large excess ( 120 mg / kg i . p . ) and are injected immediately before data ac - quisition with photon - counting cameras . Image acquisition times are on the order of minutes , depending on expression levels , depth and photon flux . One of the principal uses of luciferase imag - ing has been to track cells , in particular divid - ing cells such as tumor cells ( Fig . 4 ) 61 , 66 , progenitor and stem cells ( Fig . 4 ) , immune ( nM ) Fig . 3 NIR fluorescence imaging .

Thus , for example , luc - expressing stem cells can be seen crossing the cerebral hemispheres in a tumor model ( Fig . 4 a ) , and peritoneal proliferation of ovarian cancers can be monitored over time ( Fig . 4 b ) . Estimates from subcutaneous implantations indicate that between 10 3 and 10 4 luc cells can be detected at this location . Another important ap - plication has been to use luc as a transgene in experimental gene transfer studies 69 – 71 , as a screening tool for rapid identifica - tion of transgenic founder mice 72 or to visualize activation of specific pathways in cancer formation 73 . Most recently , engi - neered luciferases have been used to image specific cellular processes . In one study , the estrogen receptor domain was fused through a caspase - 3 - cleavable site to both ends of lu - ciferase to image apoptosis in vivo ( B . Ross , personal communi - cation ) . In experimental studies , bioluminescence has been used to image protein – protein interactions 74 and NF - κ B degra - dation 75 . It is likely that the imaging applications of luciferase will continue to expand rapidly with the use of engineered lu - ciferases , activatable luciferins and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer ( BRET ) strategies . Outlook The next few years will bring exciting advances in imaging lu - minescence and fluorescence in deep organs in vivo —both ex - perimentally and clinically . These advances will be based on ( i ) further red - shifts of probes to minimize absorption , scattering and autofluorescence ; ( ii ) novel activatable imaging probes specific for a given target ; ( iii ) multiwavelength imaging either to interrogate multiple targets or to implement signal correc - tion ; ( iv ) quantitative imaging of fluorescence through the use of photon migration theory ; and ( v ) more sensitive detectors . It is also likely that many of these advances can and will be di - rectly translated into clinical use , particularly the use of tar - geted and activatable fluorochromes . Likewise , tomographic optical imaging systems are likely to emerge and will be com - bined with traditional anatomic imaging methods . Another obvious clinical application is the use of endoscopes and la - paroscopes as well as dermatological and other intraoperative imaging devices to sense fluorochromes at body surfaces . On the horizon are other ‘activatable’ probe technologies that could ultimately be utilized in vivo . At the forefront are magnetic agents that change their relaxivity upon interac - tion with a target , either primarily spin - lattice relaxivity ( R1 ) 76 – 78 or spin - spin relaxivity ( R2 ) 79 . The latter technology is based on supramolecular assemblies of nanoparticles that change from single to oligomeric fluid phase states , accom - panied by five - to tenfold changes in R2 that are easily de - tectable by MRI . This approach has been used to sense ( and image ) DNA hybridization 79 , DNA methylation and cleav - age 80 , and protein and protease activities 81 . More recently , hybrid magnetic nanoparticle – fluorescent probes have also been developed for combined anatomic and molecular imag - ing in living organisms 82 , 83 . 1 . Pham , T . H . et al .
