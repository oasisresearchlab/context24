In a study involving ele - mentary school children aged 7 - 10 years old , we investigated the impact of playing a game with physical robots in a physical envi - ronment versus playing the same game with virtually embodied robots in a virtual environment . The game focused on developing spatial perspective - taking skills , requiring children to make moves based on the robots’ point of view . We examined how the two envi - ronments influenced their experience of fun and learning spatial reasoning skills . We conducted a between - subject user study with 59 participants from 3rd and 4th grades , where they either played with the physical or virtual version of the game . Children in both conditions showed significant improvement in their perspective - taking and spatial orientation test scores . Furthermore , they rated the physical game as more fun compared to the virtual version .

The embodiment of an agent plays a significant role in categorizing it as a robot , whereas agents without any form of embodiment are typically not classified as robots . Within this framework , a virtually embodied robot bridges physically embodied and non - embodied agents . Li [ 22 ] presents a classification informed by different forms of embodiment which utilize the dimensions of presence and embodiment leading to three types of representation : 1 ) a physically copresent robot , 2 ) a virtually telepresent robot ( virtual display of a physically embodied one ) , and 3 ) a virtually embod - ied robot . In their meta - analysis , based on 33 experimental works , robots , on average , were perceived as more effective than virtual agents in social interaction contexts [ 22 ] . Furthermore , physically present robots elicited significantly more favourable responses than digitally displayed ones . To better understand the impact of robots on human perception , some studies started off by comparing robots with virtual char - acters . For example , Kidd and Breazeal [ 18 ] mentioned that “It is not the presence of the robot that makes a difference : rather it is the fact that the robot is a real , physical thing , as opposed to the fictional animated character” . In other studies , physically versus virtually embodied robots were compared on the aspects of social presence [ 1 ] , social influence [ 28 ] , and enjoyment of the game [ 27 ] . Regardless of how humans perceive robots or agents differently or how their anthropomorphic features could elicit the human - like attribution of cognitive or emotional states toward them , we can not always conform to a definite form of embodiment and presence . As technologies and access to knowledge and education rapidly evolve , children face various forms of interaction with technologies , and it is crucial to understand how their educational gains align with the perception of the said interaction and technology . In this work , we explore children’s perceptions and performance in a game that involves spatial skills . The game is designed using both physically and virtually embodied robots and game environ - ments . By exploring these different forms of embodiment , we aim to gain insights into their impact on children’s perceptions of the game and performance in spatial reasoning skills . The game is developed based on previous work by Yadollahi et al . [ 37 , 39 ] on fostering children’s spatial perspective - taking skills using a robot in a maze . The original game was single - player [ 39 ] . The extension of the game developed for this study is the two - player version designed for both competitive and cooperative contexts . In pilot testing , the decision was made to only present children with one version of the game at a time , so they had enough time to familiarize themselves with the game . Consequently , to ensure enough participants in each condition , we decided to test only the cooperative version in the 162 HAI ’23 , December 04 – 07 , 2023 , Gothenburg , Sweden Yadollahi , et al . user study presented in this paper . In this version , the child coop - erates with another autonomous robot by guiding its own robot player . The game includes moving in a maze , where movements are dependent on children’s understanding of each player’s spatial per - spective . The experimental study is designed with two objectives : whether the embodiment ( physical vs . virtual ) of the robot and the game 1 ) impacts children’s ability to take the robot’s perspective and consequently influences their learning and performance in the game , and 2 ) impact how children perceive fun and the level of difficulty of the game . As a result , we are focusing on the following research questions : RQ1 : To what extent do different types of games and modes of interaction , such as physical and virtual embodiment , affect children’s performance in spatial reasoning tests ? RQ2 : What impact does the mode of interaction , such as phys - ical embodiment versus virtual embodiment , have on children’s performance in the game and their perception of it ? 2 RELATED WORK 2 . 1 Embodied Robot vs . Virtual Agent To understand the impact of robots on people and the perception of people about the robots , several studies have compared embod - ied robots to virtual characters [ 14 , 18 , 27 ] . For example , in the survey conducted by Li [ 22 ] , the physical presence , e . g . physically copresent or video telepresence , of the robot was shown to have elicited more psychological response to the robot as opposed to the physical embodiment . Each study on this topic focuses on a different context , such as educational [ 16 ] , social interaction [ 1 , 28 ] , or enjoyment [ 27 ] . The majority of the literature related to the em - bodiment in the educational context focuses on the robot as tutor [ 16 ] , where it is suggested that robots can be more effective tutors than their web - based or audio - based counterparts [ 11 ] . In a seminal study , Leyzberg et al . [ 21 ] compared a physically embodied robot tutor to a virtually embodied and non - embodied tutor in children’s cognitive learning . They showed that children in the physically em - bodied robot outperformed children in the other two conditions and managed to improve their puzzle - solving time significantly more . They concluded that physical embodiment could yield measurable learning gains when the robot acts as a tutor . Such conclusions might not necessarily transfer to other contexts of interaction . For example , in a study including both physically and virtually embodied robots that helped children in the context of diabetes self - management app , Sinoo et al . [ 30 ] showed that children were able to perceive the virtual and physical robot with the same agency . Their findings showed that , in line with previous research , children were capable of connecting and enjoying the interaction with robot agents as much as the physically present ones . In a recently published perspective paper , Mutlu [ 25 ] provides the case that “virtual and physical embodiment elicit fundamentally different “frames of mind” in the users of the technology” . Such distinction would eventually lead to “diverging expectations , forms of engagement , and eventually interaction outcomes” . The majority of research that focuses on the robot’s embodiment is tackling the question “which embodiment is better ? ” where typically a physical embodiment is compared with other types of embodiment and presence [ 6 ] . Therefore , a gap exists in the literature where studies are needed to explore how different mechanisms are elicited across different forms of embodiment and how to understand the best design approaches to support different embodiment levels [ 25 ] . The presented study aims to create a baseline for children’s performance and perception in two types of embodiment and inform future research where more nuanced behaviours during the interaction are recognized and analyzed . 2 . 2 Spatial Reasoning Spatial reasoning is defined as the capacity to relate to or navigate the world through understanding the spatial relationship of the objects in the environment . The literature on the topic contains several definitions for spatial reasoning from Cohen and Hegarty’s [ 4 ] “ability to create and mentally manipulate imagined shapes , objects , and structures” to Bruce et al . ’s [ 2 ] “ability to recognize and mentally manipulate the spatial properties of objects and the spatial relations among objects” . All of the available definitions hold a common theme of the ability to visualize and picture things and mentally rotate them in the environment [ 8 ] . Davis et al . [ 5 ] describe spatial reasoning as a complex phenomenon in terms of entangled processes mixed with mental cognition and physical ac - tions that might arise in the learner’s educational concepts . Their work presents a framework that collects the different competencies associated with spatial reasoning into a model that represents its complexity . According to their model , the main elements of spa - tial reasoning are : 1 ) altering , 2 ) moving , 3 ) situating , 4 ) sensating , 5 ) interpreting , and 6 ) [ de ] constructing . The element of sensating includes sub - elements of perspective - taking , visualizing , proprio - cepting , imagining , and tactilizing . Perspective - taking , the ability to understand and perceive the world from another’s viewpoints , is regarded as a fundamental skill in human interaction [ 10 ] . This skill contributes to various dimensions of human developmental psychology , such as the perceptual domain which includes a visual and spatial understanding of others and the world [ 7 , 31 ] , the cogni - tive domain through understanding other’s thoughts and reasoning [ 12 ] , and the affective domain which includes the emotional and empathic understanding of others [ 9 , 20 ] . Spatial reasoning is vital for success in STEM fields as it enables individuals to visualize , analyze , and solve complex problems in disciplines such as mathematics , engineering , and computer sci - ence [ 8 ] . Spatial reasoning competencies have been found to be correlated not only with success in STEM - related careers but also extend to various other domains [ 34 ] . Proficiency in spatial rea - soning is valuable in fields such as architecture , design , geography , aviation , and social sciences , highlighting its broad impact [ 3 ] . Par - ticularly , Wai et al . [ 34 ] have shown that high school students with a stronger demonstration of spatial skills are more likely to enjoy and pursue STEM disciplines . Despite the importance of spatial reasoning skills in learning and academic achievement , there is a limited focus on explicitly instructing it in schools [ 26 ] . Gener - ally , several reasons for this lack of interest are mentioned , such as the pervasive assumption that spatial capacities are inborn or the historical tendency to focus on procedural and abstract elements of subject matters [ 5 ] . Nevertheless , one promising possibility for explicitly practising spatial reasoning skills is the new focus on computational thinking and robotics education worldwide [ 15 , 17 ] . 163 Learning Spatial Reasoning in Virtual vs . Physical Games with Robots HAI ’23 , December 04 – 07 , 2023 , Gothenburg , Sweden This is well - aligned with the notion of the malleability of spatial reasoning skills , which makes it a suitable skill for focused and deliberate instruction [ 32 ] . This is supported by a recent systematic review by Ileri et al . [ 13 ] , which draws from developmental psychol - ogy and toy design fields to emphasize the significance of spatial cognition skills and the need for diverse toy designs . The review suggests that construction toys not only enhance physical skills but also promote spatial language and narrative during child - caregiver interactions and offers six recommendations for creating new toys and gathering evidence to enhance informal STEAM development through spatial skills . The positive effects of spatial reasoning and robotics interventions in schools have been investigated in the past few years . The studies ranged from programming and explaining adaptive robot behaviours [ 23 ] , or programming robots to solve puzzles [ 33 ] to participating in robotics course [ 15 ] that fostered hands - on learning . Several of these studies used various measures , such as pretests and posttest , to evaluate children’s improvement from the tasks . One of the commonly used tests was the perspective - taking and spatial orientation test developed by Kozhevnikov and Hegarty [ 19 ] . In recent child - robot interaction studies , research has combined the social aspects of interacting with robots with practising or learning skills [ 38 , 40 ] . The study presented in this paper taps into the importance of developing activities that fos - ter spatial reasoning abilities in children through tasks focused on spatial perspective - taking skills . The activity is an expansion of tasks previously developed and tested with similar age groups [ 37 , 39 ] . This study tries to understand whether the embodiment of the robot and the task influences children’s learning and enjoyment of participating in such activities . 3 SYSTEM DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION 3 . 1 Maze Game The game is inspired by previous studies where children had to guide a robot through a maze by taking the robot’s perspective . The maze game was designed based on three main elements [ 37 ] : 1 ) the inclusion of the robot as a game character , 2 ) a perspective - taking application , and 3 ) an educational goal . The original activity was set to utilize both the child and the robot’s embodiment in the context of developing children’s spatial skills . In this study , the game is updated as a two - player version where two robots could either compete or cooperate to win the game . The game is turn - based with two robots , where the child guides one robot , and the other robot plays autonomously . As shown in Figure 1 , the orange robot , called Callisto ( denoted by a green circle ) , is the robot guided by the child , and the blue robot called Polaris ( denoted by a yellow circle ) , plays autonomously . The goal is to move from one yellow node to another and eventually reach the green field to finish the game . However , the path to the green field is not entirely constructed ( as shown by brown blocks ) , and it can only be fixed by collecting the blue building blocks available in some paths . This means the child and the robot must plan their move by going through the paths with blue building blocks that help them reconstruct the broken path . When the robot travels between two nodes with a building block , the block disappears , and the part of the path connected to the green field is reconstructed . Figure 1 : A snap of the collaborative game in the virtual setting . The robot controlled by the child is denoted by a green circle ( bottom ) , and the AI - controlled robot is denoted by a yellow circle ( Top ) . Figure 2 : A snap of the tutorial and main game in the physical setting . 3 . 1 . 1 Game Modes . The game is designed with two modes in mind : cooperative and competitive . In the cooperative version , the players form a team , and when each of them collects a blue block , the path on both sides is reconstructed . As a result , the players need to understand the other player’s perspective to avoid blocking them and essentially reconstruct the path together and reach the green field . In the competitive version , the player that reaches the green field first wins . Furthermore , collecting the blue blocks only reconstructs the path on the side of the player that collects them . This means the players need to understand the other player’s perspective in order to block them from collecting the blue blocks . 3 . 1 . 2 Game rules . In the game , the fundamental rule is that chil - dren need to adopt their robot player’s perspective to be able to guide it using the arrow buttons ( Left / Right / Forward / Backward ) . 164 HAI ’23 , December 04 – 07 , 2023 , Gothenburg , Sweden Yadollahi , et al . Table 1 : The rule - based system for the decisions . For each move , it takes into account the result of that move for the robot or for the child ( move being blocked ) and game mode . AI Destination Child Destination Game mode Priority Apply Chance Red / Unbuilt Path - - - 100 100 % Building Block - Competitive + 3 75 % Building Block - Cooperative + 3 100 % Green Zone - - + 10 100 % Yellow with green access - - + 3 100 % - Green Zone Cooperative - 11 100 % - Green Zone Competitive + 5 65 % - Red Cooperative + 2 100 % - Building Block Cooperative - 2 100 % - Building Block Competitive + 2 65 % For instance , when the child presses the right button , their robot named Callisto turns to the right relative to the robot’s perspective rather than the child’s absolute right . Another crucial rule is to avoid making the same move as the other player’s previous move . This rule also takes into account the other player’s direction relative to their own perspective rather than the absolute directions . For example , looking at Figure 1 , if the orange robot , Callisto , turns to its right , the blue robot , Polaris , loses a life by moving to the left side of the map , e . g . its right . In the cooperative version of the game , the robots have a total of 5 lives and should work together to reach the green zone before losing all of them . The path to the greenfield is incomplete , with six missing blocks represented by brown blocks , which are reconstructed whenever one of the play - ers collects a building block . If either player passes through the path before it is fully reconstructed or falls off the maze into a red node , they lose one of the five lives . The game requires players to engage in perspective - taking by understanding moves based on both robots’ perspectives . This involves comprehending the other agent’s last move and translating the selected move to the player’s own agent orientation . Since the game’s moves are relative to each agent’s orientation rather than an absolute frame of reference , spa - tial perspective - taking plays a crucial role in successfully navigating and strategising within the game . 3 . 2 Technical Implementation 3 . 2 . 1 Physical vs . Virtual . To ensure the game effectively maps into both virtual and physical environments , our development pro - cesses initially focused on creating the virtual game . This approach provided us with greater flexibility to test ideas and explore what was achievable . Every idea tested in the virtual setting underwent a rigorous evaluation to determine its feasibility for the physical en - vironment . This iterative process allowed us to maintain a seamless transition between the two settings while ensuring that all game elements remained viable for real - world implementation . While the virtual tutorial level was self - explanatory and independent , the physical version required experimenter involvement . Similarly , the handling of building blocks differed between the virtual and physical settings , necessitating the experimenter’s involvement to adjust them manually . Adapting and optimizing the game for both environments was crucial . 3 . 2 . 2 Agent’s Decision Making . A rule - based priority system gov - erns the agent’s decision - making process . Each move is calculated based on a set of rules , with priority points being added or sub - tracted depending on the rule’s conditions . The move with the highest priority is selected , and if there is a tie , a random move is chosen . Most rules consider what the agent gains and what it loses by blocking that move . Certain rules are specific to the game mode . For instance , in the cooperative version , blocking paths to the end zone or building blocks have lower priority , while in the competitive version , it gains priority . Additionally , the competitive mode incorporates chance - based rules . For example , a move that blocks a path with a blue construction block has a 25 % chance of not applying its priority . This introduces an element of unpre - dictability to prevent excessive frustration for the child player when the autonomous agent consistently blocks their favourable moves . Although our study focused solely on the cooperative version to ensure an adequate participant number for each condition , both game modes were developed together and intended for comparison . The complete set of rules can be found in Table 1 . 3 . 2 . 3 Virtual Version . The virtual version was developed using the Unity Game Engine in C # language . The decision - making al - gorithm of the autonomous robot was implemented in C # . During the activity , the selected build would be running on the experi - menter’s private computer . Every game session saves the partici - pant’s moves data into a shared CSV file for subsequent analysis . To ensure anonymity , each child was assigned a unique identifier , and the stored data was anonymized to protect their privacy . 3 . 2 . 4 Physical Version . The physical version was developed using two Vector robots from Anki and a cardboard paper map . The robots were programmed using Python programming language and through Vector API . The same agent decision - making algorithm was implemented for the autonomous robot in Python . The script read a CSV file encoding the map and game information , including positions , paths , and building blocks . It controlled the Vector robots , replicating the behaviour of the virtual game by deciding moves , validating them , and instructing the robots to move according to the specified sequences in the CSV file . Similar to the virtual game , data was collected and stored in a comparable manner . By following this approach , the physical version of the game aimed to closely 165 Learning Spatial Reasoning in Virtual vs . Physical Games with Robots HAI ’23 , December 04 – 07 , 2023 , Gothenburg , Sweden replicate the functionality and data collection process of the virtual counterpart . 4 EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION 4 . 1 Hypotheses Hypotheses for this study are divided into hypotheses concerning performance in spatial reasoning tests as a result of playing the game ( within - and between - subjects ) and performance in the game and perception of the game as a result of embodiment ( between - subjects ) . To evaluate if playing in the game had an influence on practising and learning spatial reasoning skills , we used the perspective - takingandspatial rotationtest developedbyKozhevnikov and Hegarty [ 19 ] . The test has been used in several studies evaluat - ing children’s development of spatial reasoning [ 15 , 34 ] . Aligned with the previous research on the topic , we hypothesize that chil - dren’s performance in the test significantly improves in the posttest from the pretest . H1a . As a result of playing the cooperative game , children per - form better in the posttest compared to the pretest . Furthermore , given our main experimental conditions , where the game and robot embodiment differed between conditions and looking at the previous work on the topic where the physical and virtual embodied interaction were compared , we hypothesize that children’s improvement in the physical condition is significantly more than their improvement in the virtual conditions . One of the factors contributing to the formulation of this hypothesis is the manner in which spatial perspective - taking is employed during gameplay . Spatial perspective - taking is an embodied cognition skill that is carried out through mental processes . While humans men - tally rotate the objects or imagine themselves in another’s place , there is an expectation that physically perceiving the spatial rela - tions makes the task easier . As a result , we make the hypothesis that the embodiment condition influences the improvement . H1b . Playing the game in the physical environment leads to more improvement in the test scores in comparison to the virtual environment . We were also interested in evaluating how the nature of the environment impacts children’s understanding of the game and their performance in the game . Previous studies showed that when interacting with a physical robot , people enjoy the interaction more compared to a virtual one [ 35 ] . Furthermore , some studies have evaluated the influence of embodiment from the task perspective and shown that the participant’s impression of the robot’s watchful - ness , helpfulness , and enjoyability was affected by the embodiment [ 36 ] . Given the previous research on the topic , regarding the game performance , we expect children to perform more efficiently in the game as a sign that they understand the game and the robot’s perspective better . To measure that , we looked at the number of moves they made to finish the game and the number of lives they lost . Consequently , we hypothesize : H2a . Children in the physical embodiment condition conclude the game in fewer moves and with fewer mistakes compared to the virtual embodiment condition . Regarding the perception of the game , aligned with the previous research where children have shown more enjoyment and fun interacting with the physical robot [ 27 ] and the physical task [ 36 ] , we hypothesize the following : H2b . Children in the physical embodiment condition experience more fun in the game than in the virtual embodiment condition . 4 . 2 Participants A total of 59 children participants from the third and fourth grades were recruited from one school . From the 59 participants , the data from 3 were excluded from the analyses due to technical failures or their unwillingness to respond to the tests . Therefore , 56 children were included in the final data analyses , where 30 children were assigned to the physical condition while 26 were in the virtual condition . As for the grade breakdown , a total of 31 children were from the 3rd grade , and 25 were from the 4th grade , with the ages ranging from 7 to 10 years old . A more detailed age distribution showed 6 ( 10 . 71 % ) children were 7 years old , 31 ( 55 . 36 % ) were 8 years old , 18 ( 32 . 14 % ) were 9 years old , and a single child was ten years old . 4 . 3 Materials During the interaction , children in physical condition were seated in front of the printed map with one robot on their side , which they were guiding using the buttons , and another robot in front of them , which was cooperating with them in the game . In the virtual con - dition , children were presented with the same map and two robots in the virtual form ; hence , they were seated in front of a screen . In both conditions , children selected the direction for the robot using a piece of paper with four arrows that were placed in front of them . All the data corresponding to the robots’ movements and the tests and questionnaire responses were anonymously logged . 4 . 4 Procedures The study was conducted upon receiving institutional ethical ap - proval , and the legal guardian of all children submitted a signed consent form to the experimenter before the start of the study . At the beginning of the study , children were briefed that they could Figure 3 : An example of the modified version of the ques - tion shown to children as a solved example in the experi - ment . 166 HAI ’23 , December 04 – 07 , 2023 , Gothenburg , Sweden Yadollahi , et al .

The study took place in an empty classroom of an elementary school where children studied . One experimenter was present in the room during the interaction . The robot’s involvement in the game was fully autonomous , and since the robot was not verbally communicating with children , if they had a particular question or doubts , the experimenter was there to guide them . The interaction started with the experimenter welcoming the child and introducing them to the activity . Children were informed that they would be playing a game with the robot and would respond to a few questions before and after playing the game . They were also told that they could be at ease , feel free to ask questions , or interrupt the activity if they wished to leave and that their decisions would not impact them in terms of evaluation . After the introduction , children responded to a series of demographic questions , which generated a unique anonymity identifier that was used to store the rest of their data . In the next step , they responded to the pretest questions , and then the experimenter described the game to them . Children could practice the game using a tutorial that included a simpler version of the game . After understanding the rules of the game by going through the tutorial , they could play the main game . Upon completion of the main game , they re - sponded to the posttest questions , which were a variation of the pretest questions . They also responded to a few questions about their experience in the game . 4 . 5 Measures The experiment was designed as a between - subject study , with the game and the robot’s embodiment as an independent variable . However , due to the age range of the recruited participants , who were selected from the 3rd and 4th grades , we also decided to look at the consequences of the children’s age on their performance in the game or perception of the game . To assess our hypotheses , we evaluated three main measures : ( 1 ) children’s performance in the pretest and posttest , ( 2 ) their performance in the game , and ( 3 ) their perception of the interaction . Therefore , we were interested in measuring the following variables : 4 . 5 . 1 Learning Gain . The goal of collecting this explicit measure is twofold : 1 ) to evaluate if children become better in spatial per - spective taking related tasks after playing a cooperative game with the robot , 2 ) to see if the environment ( physical vs . virtual ) makes an impact on children’s learning . As a result , we have used the perspective - taking and spatial orientation test , developed by Kozhevnikov and Hegarty [ 19 ] , which evaluated the participants’ ability to imagine different perspectives and orientations . The test was initially designed for adults ; in our study , we have adapted the test to the younger population by simplifying it . The original test includes a description of the test , one solved example , and 12 questions . In our experiment , we used 6 of the questions in the pretest and 6 in the posttest . An example of the modified version of the test from [ 19 ] is presented in Figure 3 . If children responded correctly to a question , they received a one else , a 0 . The total scores for the pretest and posttest were the sum of the six questions ; hence , the minimum score was 0 if all responses were incorrect and 6 if all were correct . 4 . 5 . 2 Game Performance . To evaluate children’s performance , we looked at two types of implicit data collected during the game : 1 ) the number of moves made to finish the game and 2 ) the number of lives lost during the game . We used these two measures to indi - cate how the game environment could potentially affect children’s performance in optimally finishing the game and understanding the game environment , thus making fewer mistakes . 4 . 5 . 3 Perception of the Game . To understand better how children perceived the physical compared to the virtual environment , we asked children three questions at the end of the experiment . On a 5 - point Likert scale , children responded to the following questions : 1 ) How do you rate the difficulty to understand the game ? 2 ) How do you rate the difficulty to play the game ? 3 ) How do you rate the fun of the game ? . We then looked at how their rating of these questions differed between conditions . 5 RESULTS 5 . 1 Learning Gain We evaluated the scores of the perspective - taking and Spatial rota - tion test in the pretest and posttest to see if children improved in the spatial rotation task as a result of interacting with the game and the robot . First , we ran the Shapiro - Wilk ( S - W ) test to check the normality of the test results for both the pretest and posttest . With the 𝑝 < . 05 , the null hypothesis was rejected for all the test results , and thus , we considered the data not normally distributed . Further - more , children were randomly assigned between the conditions . To ensure that this random assignment was reflected in their pretest score , we ran the Mann - Whitney U test between the pretest scores 167 Learning Spatial Reasoning in Virtual vs .

The result showed that the children significantly improved from pretest to posttest in both physical ( 𝑊 = 19 . 5 , 𝑝 = . 006 , 𝑀 = 4 . 03 , 𝑆𝐷 = 1 . 51 ) and virtual ( 𝑊 = 29 . 0 , 𝑝 = . 003 , 𝑀 = 3 . 42 , 𝑆𝐷 = 1 . 27 ) conditions as shown in Figure 4 . As a result , the result supports H1a , which claims that children’s performance improves . Next , we looked at the improvement in the tests between the conditions using a mixed ANOVA . Two - way mixed ANOVA only estimated one main effect between the pretest and posttest , as previously observed using the Wilcoxon test , and no main effect of embodiment and interaction between the two variables was observed as shown in Table 2 . As a result , the data did not support the second hypothesis , H1b , in - dicating that children improve significantly more in the physical embodiment compared to the virtual embodiment condition . Considering that we did not observe a main effect of condition in the improvement of the test scores , we also looked at the im - provement based on the grade children were in . The Mann - Whitney U test between the pretest scores of children in the 3rd and 4th grades ( 𝑈 = 226 , 𝑝 = . 006 ) showed that the fourth graders per - formed significantly better in the pretest compared to their 3rd - grade counterparts . The result of the Wilcoxon signed - rank test showed that children significantly improved from pretest to posttest both in 3rd ( 𝑊 = 29 . 5 , 𝑝 = . 002 , 𝑀 = 3 . 35 , 𝑆𝐷 = 1 . 53 ) and 4th ( 𝑊 = 18 . 0 , 𝑝 = . 007 , 𝑀 = 4 . 24 , 𝑆𝐷 = 1 . 61 ) grades as shown in Fig - ure 5 . This result was confirmed using further analyses with the two - way mixed ANOVA , which showed two main effects for the improvement in the test and grades with no interaction between the two variables as shown in 3 . 5 . 2 Game performance To evaluate how the embodiment conditions influenced children’s game performance , we looked at the number of moves made in the game and the number of lost lives . Shapiro - Wilk ( S - W ) test showed that with ( 𝑝 < . 05 ) , none of the data for the number of moves and the number of lost lives were normally distributed . As a result , we used the Mann - Whitney test for non - parametric data to compare the performance between the two conditions . The test indicated no significant difference ( 𝑈 = 465 . 5 , 𝑝 = . 22 ) between the number of moves in the physical ( 𝑀 = 16 . 20 , 𝑆𝐷 = 4 . 79 ) compared to the virtual condition ( 𝑀 = 15 . 29 , 𝑆𝐷 = 5 . 7 ) . Similarly , no significant difference ( 𝑈 = 311 . 0 , 𝑝 = . 16 ) was found between the number of lost lives in each condition . As a result , we could not gather enough evidence to support H2a , which means further investigations are needed to understand if robot embodiment can influence children’s performance in the game . 5 . 3 Perception of the Game From the three questions asked , we did not observe any significant difference in how children perceived the difficulty of the games and the rules . This was tested using the Mann - Whitney U test for non - parametric data , which did not yield a significant difference for both questions , the difficulty of the game ( 𝑈 = 321 , 𝑝 = . 23 ) and difficulty of the rules ( 𝑈 = 408 , 𝑝 = . 37 ) . For the question regarding the experience of fun and testing of our hypothesis H2b , we evaluated children’s responses to the question “How do you rate the fun of the game ? ” . Since we hypothesized children show more fun in the physical condition than the virtual one , we conducted a 1 - tailed Mann - Whitney U test to determine whether the hypothesis holds true . The results indicated a significant difference between groups ( 𝑈 = 458 , 𝑝 = . 034 ) , showing that children rated the physical game as more fun . However , as seen from the responses , their score was relatively high for both conditions . 6 DISCUSSION When we developed the study , we expected the nature of the task , which was in the realm of spatial perspective - taking , and the real - time interaction with a robot to make a significant difference in the way children perceived and performed in the game . The result ( H2a ) showed that children’s performance in terms of the number of moves or the number of lost lives was not influenced by the embodiment of the game and the robot . This can be due to the way the games were structured and the way the level of difficulty of the game was in tune with children’s perspective - taking skills . These results could potentially inform the future design of such activities in the virtual setting without worrying that it inhibits children’s performance . The study’s findings indicate that regardless of the physical or virtual embodiment , children demonstrated significant improve - ment in spatial reasoning skills from the pretest to the posttest . This supports the notion that both conditions provided opportunities for children to practice and enhance their spatial reasoning abilities , leading to improved performance on the test . Not finding any sig - nificant difference in the test improvement between the conditions ( H1b ) supports our previous discussion and shows that one setting 168 HAI ’23 , December 04 – 07 , 2023 , Gothenburg , Sweden Yadollahi , et al . was not significantly superior to the other . While the embodiment of the game and the presence of the robot did not affect performance , there was a significant difference in how children perceived the fun factor of the game . This highlights the influence of embodiment on subjective enjoyment and engagement ( H2b ) . Children’s perception of game difficulty and understanding of rules did not significantly differ between conditions . This suggests that in our game , the en - joyment experienced during the game did not necessarily influence their learning outcome . However , the experimenter observed that just seeing the Vector robot in person excited children a lot , and the fact that they could see the robot moving around the maze in front of them could be a big factor in how they evaluated the fun . We would expect if they had long - term interaction with the robot or played the game in multiple sessions , their focus would shift from the novelty of seeing the robot to other aspects of the game . Never - theless , children in the virtual game highly rated the game , which suggests that the virtual game itself possesses engaging qualities that go beyond the novelty of the robot . 6 . 1 Observation of Children’s Behavior In the pilot tests of the experiment , we included a few questions that asked children to specify their approach to take the robot’s per - spective . However , we realized children had a hard time explaining their process , even when they were given predefined answers such as ”I rotated my head” . We removed those questions from the final experiment and opted to take notes of children’s explicit behaviours to keep track of their tactics . We mainly observed three primary behaviours : hand gestures , head / body rotation , and button rotation ( rotating the input sheet to match the robot’s perspective ) . In total , 17 children used hand gestures , 26 used head and / or body rotation , and 11 children rotated the buttons . One interesting observation was that all five children who scored perfectly in the pretest used head / body rotation while playing the game . We decided not to ana - lyze this data set for this experiment qualitatively and just report the observations here and use it to define rigorous data collection metrics for future studies . Regarding the children’s engagement with the games , we observed that while children were still happy to play the game , they lacked the same level of excitement or reaction shown in the physical game . The novelty of interacting with the Vector robots was apparent , as children were highly engaged and fascinated by them . They found the robots " cute " and expressed a desire to play more with them at the end of the activity . Chil - dren were allowed to have additional interaction with the robot only after completing all the experimental steps . Furthermore , we observed that in the physical condition , children often almost im - mediately answered five or very fun without a second thought , in contrast with slower or hesitant responses to the other questions of the questionnaire ( related to the difficulty of the game ) or to the same question in the Virtual condition . 6 . 2 Limitations One of the main limitations of the study was the small number of participants in each age group . We only managed to recruit par - ticipants from two grades , given the total number of students in the school . The perspective - taking skills that we measured fully develop around the age of our participants , meaning their skills might significantly differ based on their age group and developmen - tal stage . Another limitation of the study was not having a control group to evaluate if the improvement in the posttest was solely the result of playing the game or the result of getting better at taking the test by doing more of them . 6 . 3 Future Work This work aims to contribute to the understanding of how the physical and virtual embodiment of spatial reasoning tasks and robots could potentially influence children’s experience in the task , both from learning and enjoyment standpoints . Developing such interactions and tasks in the virtual environment provides more flexibility in development and accessibility . In contrast , the physical environment could bring more enjoyment and a fun experience when interacting with the robot . In future research , we aim to expand the development of such spatial reasoning tasks within the virtual domain , particularly exploring the potential of virtual reality as a tool for enhancing spatial reasoning skills . In recent years , research interest in using virtual reality and games to foster children’s learning in educational settings [ 29 ] or pain management in the healthcare settings have increased [ 24 ] . The increase in using such technologies on a daily basis would inspire more systematic research in understanding the advantages and disadvantages of using these systems not only from the usability standpoint but also from the user , e . g . children’s perspective . 7 CONCLUSION We conducted a study with children where children played a co - operative game with a robot and simultaneously practised their spatial reasoning skills . We developed the physical and virtual ver - sions of the game and manipulated the embodiment of the robot and the game between the conditions . The main goal of the user study was to evaluate how the embodiment of the game and the robot impact children’s performance and how that corresponds to their perception of fun and difficulty . The result of the study supported the hypotheses concerning children’s improvement in the posttest compared to the pretest as a result of playing the game . However , it did not support the hypothesis on the impact of embod - iment on children’s improvement in spatial reasoning skills or their performance in the game . Despite this lack of influence , children consistently rated the physical version of the game as more en - joyable than the virtual version . These findings have implications for future research in developing activities to enhance children’s spatial reasoning skills in virtual and virtual reality domains . While a physical embodiment with robots is engaging , it may not always be feasible or accessible . Exploring alternative modes of interac - tion that can yield similar results while being more accessible and flexible would be valuable for future research in this field .
