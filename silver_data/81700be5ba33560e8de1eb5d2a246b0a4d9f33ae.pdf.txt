The contributions of the cytoskeleton , specifically actomyosin tension , to these effects have been described , but the exact biophysical mechanisms that translate changes in cell geom - etry to changes in cell behaviour remain mostly unresolved . Using a variety of innovative materials techniques , we dem - onstrate that the nanostructure and lipid assembly within the cell plasma membrane are regulated by cell geometry in a ligand - independent manner . These biophysical changes trigger signalling events involving the serine / threonine kinase Akt / protein kinase B ( PKB ) that direct cell - geometry - dependent mesenchymal stem cell differentiation . Our study defines a central regulatory role by plasma membrane ordered lipid raft microdomains in modulating stem cell differentiation with potential translational applications . Proteomics and Förster resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) imag - ing studies suggest that cytoskeletal proteins interact and associ - ate with plasma membrane lipid raft microdomains 5 , which are important regulators of cell signalling 6 . Using model membranes , it was proposed that the formation of actin cytoskeleton networks induces membrane phase separation and heterogeneity , indicating lipid raft formation 7 . Thus , events resulting in enhanced forma - tion of cytoskeletal networks , such as integrin engagement with the extracellular matrix and focal adhesion formation were found to increase membrane order 8 , a biophysical hallmark of lipid rafts 9 , 10 . We hypothesized that cell - architecture - related changes in cytoskel - etal networks modulate lipid rafts independently of soluble extra - cellular cues . As a result , the biophysical state of the cytoskeleton directly regulates the activity of cell signalling proteins associated with plasma membrane microdomains . Although this has been shown in differentiated cell types , the relationship between rafts and cytoskeleton in mesenchymal stem cell function and fate is largely unknown . We cultured human mesenchymal stem cells ( hMSCs ) on surfaces micropatterned with fibronectin islands of tri - angular , square and circular geometries with identical surface area ( 1 , 350 µ m 2 ) . Cells adhered to fibronectin and displayed distinct morphologies and cytoskeletal arrangement dictated by island geometries ( Fig . 1a , b ) . Fluorescence intensity heat maps of F - actin and myosin IIa highlighted differences in cell contractility among the three geometries ( Fig . 1c ) . Analysis of the compliance of liv - ing cells by atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) revealed differences in shape - dependent stiffness between triangular and circular , and square and circular cells . Higher stiffness measured in triangular and square cells correlated with cell contractility ( Fig . 1d ) . The AFM data reveal a link between cell shape and elasticity , independently of adhesion area . To observe 3D structural arrangements of the plasma membrane , we serially sectioned cells in situ using focused ion beam ( FIB ) coupled to imaging ( Fig . 2a ) . 3D reconstructions of plasma membranes brought to light remarkably different topogra - phies across cell geometries down to the nanoscale ( Fig . 2b ) . This observation correlated with a significantly increased number of membrane invaginations in the size range of 50 – 100 nm , resem - bling caveolae , a subset of lipid rafts , in triangular compared with circular cells ( Fig . 2c , d , non - treated ) . These data point to a connec - tion between cell contractility and caveolae formation . Interestingly , it was previously reported that white blood cells and neurons lack caveolae despite having planar - shaped lipid rafts 11 . This suggests that caveolae are a product of surface area demand and supports the notion that cells with lower cytoskeletal contractility assemble less caveolae . Thus micropatterning cells in different shapes but with the same adhesion area can decouple area and cytoskeletal contractility . Next , we analysed the number of caveolae in triangu - lar , square and circular hMSCs in the presence of cytochalasin D , a mycotoxin that interferes with actin polymerization . The treatment abolished cell - shape - dependent differences in caveolae abundance ( Fig . 2d , CytoD ) . Furthermore , treatment with Y27632 , a ROCK ( Rho - associated kinase ) inhibitor that blocks myosin IIa light chain phosphorylation and consequently actomyosin contraction , had a similar effect ( Fig . 2d ) . As caveolae are cholesterol - rich structures , we tested methyl - β - cyclodextrin ( M β CD ) , a cholesterol - sequester - ing agent that disrupts the integrity of lipid rafts 12 . Treating hMSCs with M β CD lowered the number of caveolae across cell shapes com - pared with non - treated cells and erased geometry - dependent differ - ences ( Fig . 2d and Supplementary Fig . 1 ) .

NATuRE MATERiAlS | VOL 17 | MARCH 2018 | 237 – 242 | www . nature . com / naturematerials 237 Letters NATUre MATeriAls with M β CD did not impair cell spreading on fibronectin islands ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . However , F - actin staining revealed less actin bundling and focal organization in square and triangular cells supporting the interdependence between actin cytoskeleton and lipid rafts . This interdependence has been shown in neurons where cholesterol depletion results in aberrant axonal growth and guidance 13 . We further investigated the relationship between geometrical cues and lipid rafts with total internal reflection fluorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy . We used fluorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) - conjugated cholera toxin B subunit ( CTB ) , a GM1 gangliosides binder , and flu - orescent filipin III . CTB binds specifically to lipid rafts 14 and filipin III binds cholesterol 15 . We detected a higher FITC – CTB signal on the plasma membrane of triangular and square hMSCs compared with circular cells ( 2 and 1 . 5 fold , respectively ) . The intensity of fluorescent filipin III was around 20 % and 10 % higher in trian - gular and square cells , respectively , compared with circular cells ( Fig . 3a , b ) . The chemical heterogeneity of the plasma membrane across cell geometries correlates with the structural heterogeneity observed by FIB while the underlying biophysical mechanism and structure – function relationship are yet to be understood . Plasma membrane invaginations detected by FIB are likely caveolae based on their size and sensitivity to M β CD treatment . Because caveo - lae , a subtype of lipid rafts 16 , are caveolin - 1 positive structures , we measured caveolin - 1 expression on the plasma membrane of pat - terned hMSCs . TIRF imaging revealed around 20 % more caveolin - 1 expressed on the plasma membrane of triangular and square cells compared with circular cells ( Fig . 3a , b ) in line with the quantifica - tion of caveolae - like invaginations observed by FIB ( Fig . 2a – d ) . The average distance of cells from the substrate was comparable across shapes , reducing the likelihood of differences detected by TIRF being artefactual ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . These data indicate that cell geometry regulates the abundance of lipid rafts and caveolae . In fact , CD71 , a transferrin receptor associated to non - raft membrane domains , was equally expressed on the membrane of triangular and circular cells ( Fig . 3c , d ) . To further probe the link between cytoskel - etal contractility and caveolae , we imaged CTB and caveolin - 1 in the presence or absence of Y27632 . Disrupting the RhoA pathway abolished cell - shape - dependent differences in caveolae and lipid raft abundance ( Fig . 3e , f ) , indicating that cytoskeletal contractil - ity can regulate plasma membrane biophysics in an extracellular signalling - independent fashion . As expected , sequestering choles - terol with M β CD also erased cell - shape - dependent modulation of lipid rafts . It appears that M β CD treatment causes redistribution of Cav - 1 from the periphery into internal regions within the substrate - facing plasma membrane in circular hMSCs , suggesting that cells are subjected to cytoskeletal rearrangement on M β CD treatment ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . Furthermore , the effect of cell shape on plasma membrane order was investigated by analysing giant plasma membrane vesicles ( GPMVs ) isolated from triangular , square and circular micropatterns using C - laurdan as reported elsewhere 17 . GPMVs from triangular cells displayed the highest membrane order ( Fig . 3g , h ) , further suggesting that lipid rafts are more abundant in these cells . As a control , we analysed GPMVs from hMSCs grown in a tissue culture flask with or without M β CD ( Supplementary Fig . 5 ) . Considering the cell signalling and endocytosis function of lipid rafts and caveolae 16 , we investigated whether the observed cell - geometry - dependent changes could trigger downstream signalling driving cell behaviour . It was recently reported that activity of the serine / threonine kinase Akt is regulated by its association with lipid rafts 18 . Lipid rafts facilitate recruitment to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane and subsequent activation of Akt and its activa - tor phosphoinositide - dependent kinase - 1 ( PDK1 ) 19 , 20 . Furthermore , M β CD - mediated cholesterol depletion abolishes Akt signalling in keratinocytes 21 . Activated by growth factors , cytokines and ligand - independent stimuli , Akt and PDK1 are recruited to the plasma membrane resulting in the phosphorylation of Akt at T308 initiat - ing a signal transduction cascade 22 . We measured Akt phosphoryla - tion at the T308 site via the in - cell western ( ICW ) assay ( Fig . 4a ) . In line with the differential lipid raft assembly in cells displaying high cytoskeletal contractility , we found significantly higher Akt T308 phosphorylation in triangular and square cells compared with circular cells ( Fig . 4f , control ) . Since Akt recruitment to the plasma membrane is important for its activation , we quantified Akt abun - dance by TIRF microscopy ( Fig . 4b ) . We found more Akt protein on the surface of triangular and square cells compared with circular cells ( Fig . 4c ) . To explore Akt association to lipid rafts , we analysed the correlation of Akt and CTB signals in TIRF microscopy using Pearson’s coefficient . Due to the resolution limit of TIRF micros - copy , the co - localization is limited to plasma membrane microdo - mains . We found increased co - localization of CTB and Akt as well * * * * b a c d Y oung ' s m odu l u s ( P a ) 1 , 500 1 , 000 500 0 n . s . n = 50 n = 44 n = 41 n = 51 n = 50 n = 49 F - Actin Myosin IIa Fig . 1 | Cell geometry induces changes in cytoskeletal arrangement and cell contractility . a , Representative SEM micrographs of micropatterned hMSCs .

To corroborate the ICW data and validate signal specificity , we ran a western blot for pan Akt and phospho - Akt T308 using the same antibodies used in the ICW assay ( Fig . 4e ) . Western blots showed a decrease in Akt T308 phosphorylation in circular cells compared with triangular cells ( non - cropped blots in Supplementary Fig . 6 ) . We further analysed the connection between cytoskeletal con - tractility , lipid rafts and Akt T308 phosphorylation using chemical inhibitors . Disrupting lipid rafts by M β CD or filipin III 21 , 23 treatment reduced Akt T308 phosphorylation in high - contractility geometries abolishing shape - dependent differences ( Fig . 4f ) . We observed a similar effect when treating with Y27632 and CytoD ( Fig . 4f ) . The Akt allosteric inhibitor MK2206 24 also erased shape - driven Akt T308 phosphorylation ( Supplementary Fig . 7 ) . Importantly , MK2206 blocks the pleckstrin homology ( PH ) domain of Akt that is required for lipid raft association . Taken together , these data demonstrate the existence of a previously unexplored mechanism of cell - geometry - dependent Akt activation mediated by cell contrac - tility and lipid raft formation . To further understand the molecular mechanism behind Akt activation by cell shape changes , we investigated the role of the Akt upstream activator phosphatidylinositol - 3 kinase ( PI3K ) . PI3K mediates conversion of membrane phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bispho - sphate ( PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 ) to phosphatidylinositol 3 , 4 , 5 - trisphosphate ( PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P3 ) , which recruits both Akt and its activator PDK1 to the plasma membrane by direct interaction 25 . We overexpressed a plasma - membrane - targeted , constitutively active PI3K in hMSCs . As expected , engineered cells displayed a higher level of Akt phos - phorylation compared with control cells ( Supplementary Fig . 7 ) . Interestingly , hMSCs with increased PI3K activity did not dis - play significant differences in shape - dependent Akt phosphory - lation compared with control cells , indicating that the observed a c d b 0 . 0 2 . 5 5 . 0 7 . 5 10 . 0 12 . 5 N u m be r o f c a v eo l ae pe r 10 μ m N u m be r o f c a v eo l ae pe r 10 μ m N u m be r o f c a v eo l ae pe r 10 μ m N u m be r o f c a v eo l ae pe r 10 μ m 0 . 0 2 . 5 5 . 0 7 . 5 10 . 0 12 . 5 0 . 0 2 . 5 5 . 0 7 . 5 10 . 0 12 . 5 0 . 0 2 . 5 5 . 0 7 . 5 10 . 0 12 . 5 * Non - treated CytoD Y27632 M β CD Fig . 2 | Cell geometry regulates plasma membrane morphology and topography . a , High - resolution electron micrographs of cells in situ generated by focused ion beam microscopy .

NATuRE MATERiAlS | VOL 17 | MARCH 2018 | 237 – 242 | www . nature . com / naturematerials 240 Letters NATUre MATeriAls mechanism is independent of the amount of phosphatidylinositol ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) - trisphosphate ( PIP3 ) on the plasma membrane ( Fig . 4g ) . On the contrary , inhibition of PI3K activity by LY294002 , an inhibitor of the P110 catalytic subunit , abolished shape - dependent Akt T308 phosphorylation , indicating that PIP3 is required ( Fig . 4f , LY ; non - normalized data are shown in Supplementary Fig . 9 ) . Additional protein kinases can be involved in this mechanism as LY294002 retains non - selective activity . Lastly , we investigated the regulation of stem cell differen - tiation . Micropatterned hMSCs cultured in mixed adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation medium with low and high cytoskel - etal contractility , differentiated preferentially into adipocytes and osteoblasts , respectively ( Fig . 5a – c ) , as previously published 2 , 3 , 26 . Differentiation was assessed in binary images with colour decon - volution of 7 - day cultures stained with OilRedO and for alkaline phosphatase activity ( Supplementary Fig . 10 ) . Inhibition of cell contractility by Y27632 and CytoD led to the abolishment of cell shape differences since adipogenic differentiation increased by several fold in cell geometries with higher contractility ( Fig . 5d ) . Remarkably , inhibiting lipid rafts with M β CD erased differences in lineage commitment dictated by cell shape and treating with filipin III resulted in an increase in adipogenesis in triangular and square cells ( Fig . 5d ) . These data bring to light the existence of a previously unknown mechanism that links lipid raft formation to hMSC differentiation . Importantly , treatment with MK2206 shifted overall differentiation towards adipogenesis without significant cell - geometry - dependent differences ( Fig . 5d ) . These data define Akt as a major player in cell - geometry - dependent osteogenesis . We propose that high cell contractility favours lipid raft formation and / or stability , triggering Akt recruitment to the plasma membrane , pathway activation and osteogenic differentiation . In line with data presented in Fig . 4g , increased PI3K activity did not change cell - geometry - dependent differentiation ( Fig . 5e ) . Interestingly , FIB cross - sections of whole hMSCs showed characteristic lipid vacuoles ( Fig . 5f ) . Circular hMSCs carried a higher number of these struc - tures , further supporting their preferential adipogenic phenotype ( Fig . 5g ) . This phenotype is dependent on cytoskeletal contractility and the presence of lipid rafts as treatment with CytoD and M β CD reduced the shape - dependent differences ( Fig . 5g ) . To conclude , by applying innovative materials and imaging techniques , we investigated the cell / substrate interface and studied plasma membrane morphology at the nanoscale level . We discov - ered a mechanism by which cell geometry regulates cell signalling via modulation of plasma membrane order .

Micropatterned substrates were produced according to previously described protocols 29 , 30 . Briefly , polydimethylsiloxane ( PDMS , Sylgard 184 ; Dow Corning ) stamps were generated by replica casting against a silicon master made by photolithography ( gift from H . M . Textor ) . Immediately before microcontact printing , stamps were washed and treated with air plasma for 1 min ( 200 mtorr ) ( Plasma Prep 5 , Gala Instruments ) . Then , the stamps were inked by immersion in bovine fibronectin ( Sigma ) solution ( 50 µ g ml – 1 in phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) ) for 1 h . Afterwards , blow dried stamps were placed in conformal contact with the substrate ( non - treated polystyrene multi - dish , Nunclon Surface ) . The non - patterned area was then passivated by adding a Pluronic F127 ( Sigma ) solution ( 0 . 4 % w / v in PBS ) for 2 h . Micropatterns for TIRF were generated by using silanized glass as a substrate for cell micropattern preparation according to a protocol published previously 31 . Culture of human mesenchymal stem cells and differentiation protocol . Human mesenchymal stem cells ( hMSCs ) ( PromoCell ) were cultured and seeded on micropatterned substrates according to a previously described protocol 29 . Briefly , hMSCs were cultured in mesenchymal stem cell growth medium ( PromoCell ) using standard cultivation conditions ( 37 °C , 5 % CO 2 ) . For cell micropattern generation , cells were trypsinized ( 0 . 25 % v / v trypsin - ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ( EDTA ) solution ( Invitrogen ) ) and seeded in serum - free growth medium at a density of 13 , 000 cells per cm 2 . After 2 h incubation , cells were fully adhered and spread , and the samples were washed with PBS followed by the addition of serum - containing media . For differentiation , mesenchymal stem cell adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation medium was used ( both from PromoCell ) . Antibodies and reagents . Mouse monoclonal anti - phospho - Akt ( T308 ) ( 1 : 200 ) , anti - phospho - Akt ( Ser 473 ) , polyclonal rabbit anti - Akt ( 1 : 300 ) , polyclonal rabbit anti - myosin IIa light chain ( 1 : 400 ) , monoclonal rabbit anti - CD71 , monoclonal rabbit anti - Src , monoclonal rabbit anti - PDK1 as well as monoclonal mouse anti - phospho myosin IIa light chain ( 1 : 100 ) were all purchased from Cell Signaling Technology . Glyceraldehyde 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ) was bought from Ambion . FITC - conjugated cholera toxin B subunit ( 1 : 50 ) as well as filipin III from Streptomyces filipinensis ( 1 : 10 ) were purchased from Sigma . Alexa Fluor 488 and Alexa Fluor 568 phalloidin ( 1 : 300 ) and DAPI ( 4’ , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ) were all obtained from Molecular Probes ( Invitrogen ) . Polyclonal rabbit anti - caveolin - 1 ( 1 : 400 ) was purchased from Abcam . Secondary antibodies anti - mouse Alexa Fluor 568 ( 1 : 400 ) and anti - rabbit Fluor 488 ( 1 : 400 ) were bought from Molecular Probes . Infrared secondary antibodies , IRdye 680RD goat anti - mouse IgG and IRdye 800CW anti - rabbit ( both 1 : 1 , 000 ) were purchased from LiCor . For inhibitor studies , the following concentrations were used : 2 . 5 µ M Y27632 , 40 nM cytochalasin D ( both from Sigma ) , 3 µ M MK2206 ( Active Biochemicals ) , 0 . 5 mM methyl - β - cyclodextrin ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) , 0 . 5 µ M filipin III and 20 µ M LY294002 ( both from Cayman Chemicals ) . Concentrations were determined based on cell morphology analysis . Y27632 and methyl - β - cyclodextrin were both solubilized in PBS , all other inhibitors were solubilized in dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) according to manufacturer instructions . AdPI3K transfection . hMSCs were maintained in growth media ( 10 % v / v fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) in low - glucose Dulbecco ' s modified Eagle ' s medium ( DMEM ) ) . hMSCs were plated at a confluency of 13 , 000 cells per cm 2 overnight , and the next day infected with either GFP or PI3K - p110CAAX ( ‘AdPI3K’ ) virus for 5 h . The following day , cells were trypsinized and 13 , 000 cells per cm 2 were plated on Pluronic - blocked micropatterned substrates in the presence of growth media or differentiation media for Akt activity assays or differentiation assays , respectively . Differentiation medium consisted of 1 : 1 adipogenenic : osteogenic media and was changed every 3 days . Adipogenic media contained 3 % v / v FBS , 1 % v / v penicillin - streptomycin , 500 µ M 3 - Isobutyl - 1 - methylxanthine ( IBMX ) , 2 µ M rosiglitazone , 1 µ M dexamethasone , 17 µ M pantothenate , 33 µ M biotin and 1 µ M insulin in DMEM / F12 . Osteogenic media contained 10 % v / v FBS , 1 % v / v penicillin - streptomycin , 100 nM dexamethasone , 250 µ M ascorbic acid - 2 - phosphate and 10 mM β - glycerophosphate . Giant plasma membrane vesicle isolation and analysis . Giant plasma membrane vesicles ( GPMVs ) were isolated and analysed according to a previously published protocol 17 . Briefly , hMSCs were cultured on triangular , square and circular micropatterns for 24 h , washed with GPMV buffer ( 10 mM 4 - ( 2 - hydroxyethyl ) - 1 - piperazineethanesulfonic acid ( HEPES ) , 150 mM NaCl , 2 mM CaCl 2 , pH 7 . 4 ) and then incubated in GPMV isolation solution ( 25 mM paraformaldehyde / 2 mM dithiothreitol in GPMV buffer ) for 2 h . Afterwards , the solution was collected and transferred into bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) - coated vials . After 30 min , 50 µ l from the bottom of the vial was transferred into a fresh BSA - coated vial and labelled with 1 µ l of 0 . 2 mM solution of 6 - dodecanoyl - 2 - dimethylaminonaphthalene ( C - laurdan ) ( Molecular Probes ) for 30 min . Microscopy data analysis . For fluorescence analysis , cells grown on micropatterns were immunostained using standard procedures described previously 30 . Briefly , formalin - fixed cell samples were permeabilized with 0 . 25 % v / v Triton - X - 100 / PBS for 2 min followed by blocking in bovine serum albumin solution ( 4 % w / v in PBS ) . Primary and secondary antibodies staining was performed for 1 h in blocking buffer at room temperature . For TIRF microscopy analysis using plasma membrane lipid markers CTB and filipin III , samples were not permeabilized with Triton - X - 100 to preserve the plasma membrane . Only single cells that were confined into the desired shape were selected by using the microscope in bright - field mode . An Olympus BX51 upright and an Olympus inverted microscope were used to image fluorescence and phase contrast samples . For the histological analysis , cells were inspected by phase contrast to determine whether they expressed lineage - specific markers based on what has been described previously 2 . Briefly , for patterned hMSCs , only single cells that adhered to the pattern were used for statistical analysis . Cells that contained lipid vacuoles stained red by OilRedO were counted as adipocyte specification . Cells that stained blue for alkaline phosphatase were counted as osteoblast committed cells . For additional quantitation we performed a colour deconvolution of all cells across a surface stained with both markers based on what was published earlier 2 . Briefly , raw RGB images acquired by phase contrast with a 20 × objective were imported in ImageJ , background - subtracted and afterwards colour deconvoluted by a publicly available colour deconvolution plugin for ImageJ commonly used for separating similar histology stains ( http : / / www . dentistry . bham . ac . uk / landinig / software / cdeconv / cdeconv . html ) with colour - specific vectors adapted to the particular images . The resulting separated red and blue channels were binarized with a set threshold based on visual examination and subsequently quantified . The generation of immunofluorescence heat maps was performed as described previously 2 , 29 ; briefly , fluorescent images of cell samples were obtained on the same day and using the same microscope and camera settings . Raw fluorescent images were background - subtracted in ImageJ , incorporated and aligned into a Z hyperstack and the summarized intensity was calculated for heat map generation . For total internal reflection fluorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy , samples on glass substrate ( glass bottom dish , MatTek product number P35G - 0 - 10 - C ) in PBS were imaged using a TIRF microscope as described previously 30 , 32 using a 488 nm laser diode and a 100 × / 1 . 45 W Alpha Plan Fluar objective . Resulting 16 bit raw images were background - subtracted and binarized for quantification purposes using ImageJ software . For high - resolution co - localization analysis , background - subtracted TIRF microscopy images of two different channels were merged into one image . Then , Pearson’s coefficient was analysed with ImageJ using the JACoP Plugin ( http : / / rsb . info . nih . gov / ij / plugins / track / jacop2 . html ) . Multiphoton imaging of C - laurdan - labelled GPMVs was performed with an inverted Olympus IX81 microscope with a 25 × water immersion long working distance objective using a MaiTaiDeepSea Laser at 800 nm excitation and emission filtered at 410 – 440 nm as well as at 502 – 548 nm . Western blot , in - cell western and immunofluorescence assays . For the in - cell western assay , cellular proteins were quantitated in situ based on infrared intensity . Samples were immunolabelled with an infrared conjugated IgG secondary antibody using standard immunofluorescence protocol and imaged using an Odyssey Fc Infrared Imaging System ( LiCor ) in the highest resolution ( 21 µ m ) . The resulting signal intensity was subsequently quantified by using the Odyssey CLx Image Studio Analysis Software . Western blots were performed according to a standardized procedure published previously 33 . Briefly , Ad ( GFP ) and Ad ( PI3K ) cells were lysed in 25 mM HEPES , 75 mM NaCl , 1 % v / v tergitol - type nonyl phenoxypolyethoxylethanol ( NP - 40 ) , 1 mM EDTA , 1 × Halt protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail ( Thermo Scientific ) , and centrifuged at 14 , 000 r . p . m . for 10 min at 4 °C . Lysates from cells were obtained with radioimmunoprecipitation assay ( RIPA ) buffer ( Sigma ) containing protease inhibitors ( Roche ) and phosphatase inhibitors ( Sigma ) . Protein concentration was determined by Precision Red Advanced Protein Assay ( Cytoskeleton ) . Ten micrograms of protein were separated by denaturing sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS – PAGE ) , transferred to a poly ( vinylidene fluoride ) ( PVDF ) membrane , blocked with 5 % w / v BSA in 0 . 3 % v / v Tween - 20 in Tris - buffered saline , immunoblotted with primary antibodies ( 1 : 1 , 000 ) , and detected using horseradish peroxidase - conjugated secondary antibodies ( 1 : 5 , 000 ; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories ) and SuperSignal West Dura ( Pierce ) . Densitometric analysis was done by using a VersaDoc imaging system and QuantityOne software ( Bio - Rad Laboratories ) . Western blot was performed using infrared labelled secondary antibodies , scanned and analysed using the Odyssey imaging system and software ( LiCor ) . Atomic force microscopy analysis . hMSCs were cultured on the three micropatterned shapes for 24 h . Samples were analysed in the Petri dish in PBS at room temperature by atomic force spectroscopy . A Nanowizard I ( JPK , Germany ) atomic force microscope ( AFM ) with an inverted microscope ( IX - 81 , Olympus , Germany ) was used for all measurements . We used MLCT - D levers ( Bruker ) with a nominal spring constant of 0 . 03 N m – 1 . For analysis , cantilevers were calibrated immediately before use using the thermal noise method . Polystyrene microspheres with a diameter of 15 µ m ( Life Technologies ) were attached to AFM cantilever tips using a UV curable glue ( Loctite 350 , rs - online ) as described elsewhere 34 . Force – displacement curves were analysed using a custom developed routine in Matlab ( MathWorks ) . The contact point was identified by considering each point © 2018 Macmillan Publishers Limited , part of Springer Nature . All rights reserved . NATuRE MATERiAlS | www . nature . com / naturematerials Letters NATUre MATeriAls in the approach curve and fitting the Hertz model to the contact region and a constant value for the points thereafter . The point with the smallest error for the combined fits was identified as the contact point . The Young modulus , E , was then determined for the contact region from this point onwards . Indentation was kept below 10 % of the cell height to avoid substrate effects . Focused ion beam and scanning electron microscopy analyses . Sample preparation was performed based on previously published methods 35 . Sample fixation of micropatterned cells was performed at room temperature for 15 min using a 4 % v / v formaldehyde ( Sigma , BioReagent , ≥ 36 . 0 % ) with 0 . 2 % v / v glutaraldehyde ( Electron Microscopy Sciences ) solution in PBS . After washing the samples three times with cacodilate buffer ( Electron Microscopy Sciences ) , the samples were osmicated with osmium tetroxide in 2 % w / v cacodilate buffer for 30 min . Then , samples were washed five times with deionized water and then dehydrated through a graded ethanol ( Sigma , ACS reagent 99 . 5 % ) series . After dehydration , samples were infiltrated with Epon Resin ( Electron Microscopy Sciences ) by incubating the samples in a diluted series of ethanol - Epon Resin at a 3 : 1 , 2 : 1 and 1 : 1 ratio for 1 h each , and then overnight at 1 : 2 ratio . After that , pure resin was added , changed twice in the first 12 h and then incubated again overnight . Then , the maximum amount of resin was removed and the bottom of the well plate ( containing the cells ) was detached and centrifuged at 5 , 000 r . p . m . for 5 min . Samples were immediately placed in an oven at 60 °C and left to cure overnight . Then , samples were placed on a SEM aluminium sample holder with carbon tape and silver paint was applied to the surrounding area of the sample to maximize conductivity . Afterwards , the samples were coated with a 5 nm chromium layer in a sputter coater ( QuorumTechnologies model K575X ) . Following the coating procedure , samples were introduced into an SEM / focused ion beam ( Carl Zeiss , Auriga ) with gallium ion beam operated at 30 kV . A region over the cells with approximately 15 × 5 × 2 µ m ( length × height × depth ) was milled using 4 nA current . After that , the region exposed by the first milling was polished with 240 pA current and imaged by a backscattering detector with the electron beam operating at 1 . 5 V . To generate a 3D - surface model , individual high - resolution in situ cross - section electron micrographs of micropatterned cells were stacked using Matlab . From these volume datasets , an isosurface was extracted based on polygonal abstraction . The area between the substrate surface and substrate facing the cell plasma membrane was calculated by using the Image J software . Statistical analysis . All data were analysed by one - way ANOVA followed by a Tukey and Bonferroni post hoc analysis except AFM data in Fig . 1d that was analysed by one - way ANOVA followed by a Bartlett’s test for equal variances .

Randomization Describe how samples / organisms / participants were allocated into experimental groups . not relevant 5 . Blinding Describe whether the investigators were blinded to group allocation during data collection and / or analysis . FIB microscopy sample analysis and data quantification was performed in a blinded fashion using batch names in order to avoid bias . All other analysis and data acquisition techniques were analyzed non - blinded because of practical reasons and the availability of robust and reproducible measurement and data analysis tools . Note : all studies involving animals and / or human research participants must disclose whether blinding and randomization were used . 6 .
