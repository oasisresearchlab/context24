We aimed to identify a parsimonious set of symptoms that jointly predict COVID - 19 and investigated whether predictive symptoms differ between the B . 1 . 1 . 7 ( Alpha ) lineage ( predominating as of April 2021 in the US , UK , and elsewhere ) and wild type . Methods and findings We obtained throat and nose swabs with valid SARS - CoV - 2 PCR test results from 1 , 147 , 370 volunteers aged 5 years and above ( 6 , 450 positive cases ) in the REal - time Assessment of Community Transmission - 1 ( REACT - 1 ) study . This study involved repeated community - based random surveys of prevalence in England ( study rounds 2 to 8 , June 2020 to January 2021 , response rates 22 % – 27 % ) . Participants were asked about symp - toms occurring in the week prior to testing . Viral genome sequencing was carried out for PCR - positive samples with N - gene cycle threshold value < 34 ( N = 1 , 079 ) in round 8 ( Janu - ary 2021 ) . In univariate analysis , all 26 surveyed symptoms were associated with PCR posi - tivity compared with non - symptomatic people . Stability selection ( 1 , 000 penalized logistic regression models with 50 % subsampling ) among people reporting at least 1 symptom iden - tified 7 symptoms as jointly and positively predictive of PCR positivity in rounds 2 – 7 ( June to December 2020 ) : loss or change of sense of smell , loss or change of sense of taste , fever , PLOS MEDICINE PLOS Medicine | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pmed . 1003777 September 28 , 2021 1 / 14 a1111111111a1111111111a1111111111a1111111111a1111111111 OPEN ACCESS Citation : Elliott J , Whitaker M , Bodinier B , Eales O , Riley S , Ward H , et al .

The resulting model ( rounds 2 – 7 ) predicted PCR positivity in round 8 with area under the curve ( AUC ) of 0 . 77 . The same 7 symptoms were selected as jointly predictive of B . 1 . 1 . 7 infection in round 8 , although when comparing B . 1 . 1 . 7 with wild type , new persistent cough and sore throat were more predictive of B . 1 . 1 . 7 infection while loss or change of sense of smell was more predictive of the wild type . The main limitations of our study are ( i ) potential participation bias despite ran - dom sampling of named individuals from the National Health Service register and weighting designed to achieve a representative sample of the population of England and ( ii ) the neces - sary reliance on self - reported symptoms , which may be prone to recall bias and may there - fore lead to biased estimates of symptom prevalence in England . Conclusions Where testing capacity is limited , it is important to use tests in the most efficient way possi - ble . We identified a set of 7 symptoms that , when considered together , maximize detection of COVID - 19 in the community , including infection with the B . 1 . 1 . 7 lineage . Author summary Why was this study done ? • The rapid detection of SARS - CoV - 2 infection in the community is key to ensuring effi - cient control of transmission via isolation . • Eligibility for community PCR testing is determined based on the reported presence of several ( predetermined ) symptoms , which may vary from one country to another . • Quantitative evidence measuring which symptoms are the most informative of a COVID - 19 infection remains scarce . What did the researchers do and find ? • Data were collected from over 1 million participants in the REACT - 1 study ( June 2020 to January 2021 ) , for whom 26 symptoms were assayed and the results of a PCR test were available . • Adopting a variable selection approach , we sought to determine the best combination of symptoms jointly and complementarily predictive of PCR positivity and investigated whether these symptoms were the same between individuals infected by the wild - type virus and those infected by the B . 1 . 1 . 7 variant . • We identified 7 symptoms that were jointly predictive of PCR positivity and appeared to vary only marginally across age groups : loss or change of sense of smell , loss or change of sense of taste , fever , new persistent cough , chills , appetite loss , and muscle aches . • These symptoms were also predictive of the B . 1 . 1 . 7 infection , together with sore throat ( to a lesser extent ) .

Competinginterests : I have read the journal’s policy and the authorsof this manuscripthave the What do these findings mean ? • Taken together , these 7 symptoms can improve the detection of COVID - 19 infection in the community . • Using this sparse set of symptoms for test allocation would increase the number of tests performed ( up to 30 % – 40 % of symptomatic individuals being tested ) but would enable up to 75 % of symptomatic cases to be detected . • This set of 7 symptoms is also predictive of B . 1 . 1 . 7 infection and performs similarly across age groups . Its use would maximize the case detection rate in the community and would be particularly relevant in situations where test capacity is limited . Introduction To control the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) pandemic , rapid identification and isolation of infected individuals is essential [ 1 , 2 ] , together with testing and isolation of their contacts [ 3 , 4 ] . A range of symptoms have been identified as associated with COVID - 19 . According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , these include fever or chills , cough , shortness of breath or difficulty breathing , fatigue , muscle or body aches , headache , new loss of taste or smell , sore throat , congestion or runny nose , nausea or vomiting , and diarrhea [ 5 ] . However , it is unclear which symptoms are the most informa - tive of a COVID - 19 diagnosis . This is important in settings where test supply is limited . A novel SARS - CoV - 2 variant of concern , VOC 20DEC - 01 ( lineage B . 1 . 1 . 7 ) , was first identi - fied in England in September 2020 and became the dominant lineage in the UK within 4 months [ 6 ] . As of April 2021 , it had been detected in 114 countries [ 7 ] and had become the dominant lineage in the US , Europe , and elsewhere [ 7 , 8 ] . Here , we used data from the REal - time Assessment of Community Transmission - 1 ( REACT - 1 ) study to identify a parsimonious set of symptoms that , taken together , are the most predictive of SARS - CoV - 2 PCR positivity . For data collected during January 2021 we also compare predictive symptoms for B . 1 . 1 . 7 infection versus wild type , identified via viral genome sequencing . Methods Study population REACT - 1 is a series of community prevalence surveys of SARS - CoV - 2 virus swab positivity in England , conducted at approximately monthly intervals since May 2020 . Using the National Health Service patient register across the 315 lower - tier local authorities ( LTLAs ) in England , recruitment letters were sent to a random nationally representative sample of individuals aged 5 years and over , with a separate ( non - overlapping ) sample selected at each round . We there - fore approached a different base sample at each round and did not have repeat samples to account for . Participant sampling aimed to achieve approximately equal numbers of partici - pants in each LTLA . Random samples were drawn stratified by LTLA , with larger numbers selected in some LTLAs to address variable response rates at the LTLA level . Up to 160 , 000 valid responses and viable swabs were obtained at each round [ 9 ] . Participation involved a self - administered throat and nasal swab , and the completion of a short online or telephone PLOS MEDICINE COVID - 19 symptoms for community detection PLOS Medicine | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pmed . 1003777 September 28 , 2021 3 / 14 followingcompetinginterests : PE is the director of the MRC Centreof Environment and Health ( MR / L01341X / 1and MC / S019669 / 1 ) and has no conflict of interest to disclose .

The questionnaires used are available on the study website ( https : / / www . imperial . ac . uk / medicine / research - and - impact / groups / react - study / react - 1 - study - materials / ) . At the time of survey completion , participants were unaware of the result of their swab test . In the survey , participants were asked about new symptoms occurring in the week preceding the swab . These included a set of 26 clinically relevant symptoms potentially related to COVID - 19 : ( i ) loss or change of sense of smell and loss or change of sense of taste , ( ii ) coryzal symptoms ( runny nose , sneezing , blocked nose , sore eyes , sore throat , and hoarse voice ) , ( iii ) gastrointestinal symptoms ( appetite loss , nausea / vomiting , diarrhea , and abdomi - nal pain / belly ache ) , ( iv ) fatigue - related symptoms ( tiredness , severe fatigue , heavy arms / legs , and difficulty sleeping ) , ( v ) respiratory and cardiac symptoms ( new persistent cough , shortness of breath , chest pain , and tight chest ) , and ( vi ) other flu - like and miscellaneous symptoms ( fever , muscle aches , chills , headache , dizziness , and numbness / tingling ) . Data from round 1 were excluded as the symptom questions asked in that round were not consistent with those in the subsequent rounds [ 9 ] . Here , we use REACT - 1 data from rounds 2 to 7 ( June to December 2020 ) to identify a par - simonious set of symptoms ( from 1 week prior to testing ) that are jointly predictive of SARS - CoV - 2 PCR positivity and assess their performance among holdout community population - based data from rounds 2 to 7 and , separately , round 8 ( January 2021 ) . PCR - positive swab samples from round 8 with N - gene cycle threshold value < 34 and suffi - cient sample volume underwent genome sequencing . Viral RNA was amplified using the ARTIC protocol [ 10 ] , and sequencing libraries were prepared with CoronaHiT [ 11 ] . Samples were sequenced using the Illumina NextSeq 500 platform . Each run included 1 positive and 1 negative control per 96 samples . Sequencing data were analyzed using the ARTIC bioinfor - matic pipeline [ 12 ] . Lineages were assigned using PangoLEARN [ 13 ] . Statistical analyses Twenty - five participants ( 19 in rounds 2 – 7 and 9 in round 8 ) were excluded due to missing information on sex . We used univariate logistic regression to model the risk of testing positive for SARS - CoV - 2 as a function of symptoms reported in the week prior to testing . For multi - variable models , round 2 – 7 data ( restricted to people reporting any of the 26 surveyed symp - toms ) were split into a 70 % training set ( 76 , 187 observations , of which 1 , 078 were positive ) and a 30 % test set ( 32 , 651 observations , of which 461 were positive ) . We adopted a variable selection approach with stability selection using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator ( LASSO ) penalized logistic regression with all 26 surveyed symptoms as predictors and PCR positivity as the outcome [ 14 ] . LASSO models were fit on 1 , 000 independent random 50 % sub - samples of the 70 % training set . The stability selection penalty parameter was calibrated to give a per family error rate of fewer than 5 falsely selected symptoms [ 14 , 15 ] . The proportion of penalized models where each symptom was included ( its selection proportion ) was used as a measure of its importance ; those with selection proportion above 50 % were considered stably selected and were included in a predictive model of PCR positivity , where mean penalized odds ratios across models ( where selected ) were used as weightings . The resultant model was then applied to the 30 % holdout test set ( rounds 2 – 7 ) and , separately , to round 8 data . We then estimated the proportion of symptomatic COVID - 19 cases that would be detected using this predictive model across all levels of symptomatic community testing . As a series of sensitivity analyses , we used the same univariate and multivariate approaches to ( i ) investigate age - specific symptoms by stratifying our study population into 3 age groups ( 5 to 17 years , 18 to 54 years , and 55 years old or older ) ; ( ii ) account for possibly differential PLOS MEDICINE COVID - 19 symptoms for community detection PLOS Medicine | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pmed . 1003777 September 28 , 2021 4 / 14 predictive abilities of symptoms in relation to their sequence / timing of onset , by restricting the list of symptoms to those reported first ( rather than any symptom reported in the week prior to testing ) ; and ( iii ) search for ( sets of ) symptoms potentially discriminating B . 1 . 1 . 7 versus wild - type infections among test - positive cases . All calculations were done with the R computational environment , version 4 . 0 . 2 , using the logistic LASSO algorithm as implemented in the glmnet package and in - house scripts for the stability selection ( available at https : / / github . com / mrc - ide / reactidd / tree / master / R / symptom _ prediction _ paper _ scripts ) .

They were not involved in developing the analytical plan or the implementation of the study . There are no plans to disseminate the results of the research directly to the study participants or the relevant patient community .

Results Descriptive and univariate analyses The key characteristics of the study population in rounds 2 – 7 and 8 for the full sample and for those reporting symptoms are summarized in S1 Table . Of the 979 , 709 respondents ( after 19 exclusions ) with a valid swab test in REACT - 1 rounds 2 – 7 , 870 , 872 ( 88 . 9 % ) reported no symp - toms in the week prior to testing while 108 , 837 ( 11 . 1 % ) reported at least 1 of the 26 surveyed symptoms . We detected 4 , 168 PCR - positive cases , of whom 1 , 538 ( 36 . 9 % ) reported 1 or more symptoms in the past week . In round 8 , there were 167 , 636 participants ( after 6 exclusions ) , of whom 146 , 701 ( 87 . 5 % ) reported no symptoms in the past week and 20 , 935 ( 12 . 5 % ) reported at least 1 of the 26 surveyed symptoms . We detected 2 , 282 PCR - positive cases , of whom 1 , 031 ( 45 . 1 % ) reported 1 or more symptoms in the past week ( Fig 1 ; S2 Table ) . In univariate analy - ses , each of the 26 surveyed symptoms was associated with PCR positivity in rounds 2 – 7 and round 8 ( Fig 2 ; S2 Table ) . In rounds 2 – 7 , with a mean prevalence of PCR positivity of 0 . 46 % , the positive predictive value for any symptom was 1 . 4 % , with an odds ratio for PCR positivity of 4 . 7 compared with non - symptomatic individuals . In round 8 , with a PCR positivity preva - lence of 1 . 36 % , the positive predictive value for any symptom was 4 . 9 % , with an odds ratio for PCR positivity of 6 . 0 compared with non - symptomatic individuals ( Fig 1 ) . Multivariable analyses and community case detection Seven symptoms were selected as jointly positively predictive of PCR positivity in a LASSO sta - bility selection model trained on round 2 – 7 data : loss or change of sense of smell , loss or change of sense of taste , fever , new persistent cough , chills , appetite loss , and muscle aches . In addition , numbness / tingling was selected as jointly but negatively predictive of PCR positivity . The resultant model gave an area under the curve ( AUC ) of 0 . 75 for holdout round 2 – 7 test PLOS MEDICINE COVID - 19 symptoms for community detection PLOS Medicine | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pmed . 1003777 September 28 , 2021 5 / 14 data and 0 . 77 for round 8 data , with no improvement in AUC upon inclusion of other symp - toms ( Fig 3 ) . Testing people in the community with at least 1 of the 7 selected positively pre - dictive symptoms gave sensitivity , specificity , and positive predictive value of 71 % , 64 % , and 1 . 9 % in holdout round 2 – 7 test data and 74 % , 64 % , and 9 . 7 % in round 8 data , respectively . Per - formance of the stability selection model at varying levels of community testing is shown in S1 Fig ; for example , testing 10 % of symptomatic individuals would detect around half of all symp - tomatic cases . B . 1 . 1 . 7 ( Alpha ) lineage versus wild - type symptoms Of the 2 , 282 positive cases in round 8 , 1 , 088 had cycle threshold value < 34 and underwent viral genome sequencing ; 898 ( 82 . 5 % ) were B . 1 . 1 . 7 , 181 ( 16 . 6 % ) were wild type , and 8 were other lineages . Characteristics of the positive cases with B . 1 . 1 . 7 and wild type in round 8 were similar except for the region of the case , with a marked excess of B . 1 . 1 . 7 cases in East of England , South East , and London ( S3 Table ) . LASSO stability selection models fit on round 8 data with an outcome of B . 1 . 1 . 7 versus PCR negative selected the same 7 positively predictive symptoms as in rounds 2 – 7 ( Fig 4 ) . In univariate analysis within round 8 , there was slightly higher reporting of any symptom for B . 1 . 1 . 7 infection versus wild type . Specifically , we found a higher prevalence of sore throat , new persistent cough , fever , difficulty sleeping , dizziness , and nausea / vomiting at a nominal 0 . 05 significance level ( Fig 5A ) . Stability selection models identified sore throat and new persistent cough as jointly and positively associated with B . 1 . 1 . 7 infection compared with wild - type infection , while loss or change of sense of smell was selected as negatively associated , i . e . , more predictive of wild type infection ( Fig 5B ) . Sensitivity analyses In age - stratified analyses of round 2 – 7 data , 6 ( 5 – 17 years ) or 7 ( 18 – 54 and 55 + years ) symp - toms were jointly selected . New persistent cough was not selected for those aged 5 – 17 years but was for adults , while chills , fever , loss or change of sense of smell , and loss or change of sense of taste were selected in all age groups . Additional age - specific selected symptoms ( posi - tive coefficients ) were headache ( 5 – 17 years ) , appetite loss ( 18 – 54 and 55 + years ) , and muscle aches ( 18 – 54 years ) , and age - specific negatively associated symptoms ( negative coefficients ) were runny nose ( 5 – 17 years ) and numbness / tingling ( 55 + years ) ( S2 Fig ) .

In multivariable analysis , LASSO stability selection on round 2 – 7 data included headache as positively predictive of PCR positivity instead of appetite loss ( S4 Fig ) ; otherwise , the selected ( positively associated ) symptom set was the same as in Fig 3 , although with lower predictive performance ( AUC of 0 . 68 and 0 . 66 for holdout round 2 – 7 test data and round 8 data , respectively ) . Discussion In this study of over 1 million people in England , we found that 7 symptoms stably and jointly predicted SARS - CoV - 2 PCR positivity ; these were loss or change of sense of smell , loss or change of sense of taste , fever , new persistent cough , chills , appetite loss , and muscle aches . The first 4 of these symptoms are currently used in the UK to determine eligibility for commu - nity PCR testing , selected at a time ( May 2020 ) when testing capacity was limited . Based on our findings , this symptom set is too restrictive , and in order to improve PCR positivity Fig 2 .

This approach would have the advantage of increasing the yield of detected cases , leading to greater numbers of infected people being required to self - isolate , thereby reducing the pool of infection in the community . The use of the 7 symptoms we identified for PCR test allocation would result in 30 % to 40 % of symptomatic individuals in England being eligible for a test ( versus 10 % currently ) and , if all those eligible were tested , would result in the detection of 70 % to 75 % of the positive cases .

We believe that our approach , relying on these 7 symptoms , provides a reasonable balance between number of tests performed and detection rates in England , but alternative approaches could be envisaged depending on national population size , composition , and resources . In particular , testing individuals reporting any COVID - 19 - related symptoms has been implemented in some countries that have adopted a zero COVID - 19 policy ( e . g . , Austra - lia and New Zealand ) . Such investments have been justified by arguing that , if successful , this approach leads to an earlier and more efficient control of transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 , in turn reducing the prevalence of the infection and hence of symptoms , thus reducing the testing capacity needs . Irrespective of the test allocation strategy , prevention efficacy strongly relies on the accurate reporting of symptoms by individuals in the general population . To ensure adherence to self - isolation measures and lessen the burden of such measures in socially disadvantaged individu - als , efficient financial and other support policies should be encouraged . Failure to implement such targeted policies could introduce a social gradient in the willingness to report symptoms [ 16 ] and attend for testing , which in turn could lead to increased transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 in more deprived populations , as has been observed in England [ 17 ] . Other studies investigating sets of symptoms predictive of PCR positivity have been pub - lished [ 18 ] . As in our study , these identified loss or change of sense of smell , loss or change of sense of taste , fever , and new persistent cough as consistent predictors of infection . Of the 3 Fig 5 .

Unlike other studies , REACT - 1 involves community - based random samples of individuals in the population , and with over 1 million participants , it provides reliable , reproducible , and representative estimates of prevalence and prediction of PCR positivity in England from a combination of informative symptoms . The second wave of COVID - 19 in England coincided with the emergence of VOC 20DEC - 01 ( lineage B . 1 . 1 . 7 ) , which became dominant in the UK by January 2021 [ 6 ] and subsequently in many countries around the world as of April 2021 [ 7 ] . B . 1 . 1 . 7 is defined by 17 mutations ; 8 of these affect the viral spike protein , the means by which SARS - CoV - 2 binds to angiotensin - converting enzyme 2 ( ACE2 ) and enters host cells . These spike mutations might confer an evo - lutionary benefit . For example , the spike deletion Δ H69 / Δ V70 enhances viral infectivity in vitro [ 19 ] , and N501Y may enhance spike binding affinity to ACE2 [ 20 ] . From modeling , it has been estimated that B . 1 . 1 . 7 is 40 % to 90 % more transmissible than earlier lineages [ 21 ] and might be associated with an increased risk of hospitalization and death [ 22 , 23 ] . Here we show that the same symptoms were selected as jointly predictive of B . 1 . 1 . 7 infec - tion as for earlier lineages . However , when we compared B . 1 . 1 . 7 with wild - type infections , new persistent cough and sore throat were jointly selected as predictive of B . 1 . 1 . 7 infections , while loss or change of sense of smell was predictive of wild - type infections . This is consistent with findings from the UK Office for National Statistics Coronavirus ( COVID - 19 ) Infection Survey , where people testing PCR positive for lineages compatible with B . 1 . 1 . 7 were less likely to report loss or change of sense of taste or smell ( both symptoms combined ) , and more likely to report cough , compared with non - B . 1 . 1 . 7 - compatible lineages [ 24 ] . Our study has limitations . First , it is uncertain to what extent our findings are generalizable to other settings . However , our sampling procedure was designed to ensure good representa - tion across the whole population in England , including capturing sociodemographic and eth - nic diversity . Second , our data relied on a time - resolved series of reported symptoms from self - administered questionnaires . These may be subject to recall bias and may not precisely represent the individual dynamics of symptom onset . However , our self - reported data are based on representative community - based samples and may not share the same limitations as the routine reporting of symptoms on which test allocation and isolation measures are based [ 25 ] . Furthermore , participants were unaware of their test results at the time of symptom report , which would limit reporting and information bias . Third , as sampling in each round was cross - sectional , some individuals may have been infected ( and had symptoms ) more than 1 week before the swab was obtained but were no longer symptomatic at the time of the study or might have gone on to develop symptoms after testing . Fourth , despite our careful sample weighting to account for possible variations in response rates by sex , age , region , deprivation , and ethnicity , we cannot rule out residual selection bias . Finally , a number of B . 1 . 1 . 7 infections may have been included in PCR positive samples from rounds 5 to 7 ( estimated proportions of B . 1 . 1 . 7 infection among all SARS - CoV - 2 infections in England are 0 . 7 % [ 95 % CI 0 . 6 % , 0 . 9 % ] and 10 . 6 % [ 95 % CI 10 . 1 % , 11 . 2 % ] for November [ round 6 ] and December [ round 7 ] , respec - tively ; S5 Fig ) [ 26 ] . Overall , B . 1 . 1 . 7 would represent less than 4 % of the PCR - positive cases in rounds 2 – 7 , and because our results were suggestive of a consistent symptomatology for both B . 1 . 1 . 7 and wild - type infections , possible confounding of our results by the inclusion of early B . 1 . 1 . 7 incident cases is limited . Our main analyses fit models to the population at all ages . In age - stratified analyses , how - ever , we found a different symptom profile among children and adolescents ( ages 5 – 17 years ) , where headache ( positive association ) and runny nose ( negative association ) were selected , but new persistent cough was not . This may have implications for symptomatic testing in PLOS MEDICINE COVID - 19 symptoms for community detection PLOS Medicine | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pmed . 1003777 September 28 , 2021 11 / 14 school - aged children . Headache was also selected ( instead of appetite loss ) for first reported symptom at all ages ( 5 + years ) , but a model derived from first reported symptom was less pre - dictive of PCR positivity than the model based on all symptoms within the week prior to testing . In summary , we show that using a combination of 7 symptoms to determine test eligibility would maximize the case detection rate in the community under testing capacity constraints such as those faced in England between June 2020 and January 2021 . This has policy relevance for countries where there is limited testing capacity . We identified the same symptom set for predicting B . 1 . 1 . 7 , which by April 2021 had become the predominant lineage in the UK , US , and many other countries worldwide .
