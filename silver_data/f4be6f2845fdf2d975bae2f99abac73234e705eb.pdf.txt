The actin cytoskeleton , a highly 24 dynamic scaffolding structure , plays an important role in cell mechano - sensing . Thus , 25 understanding rheological behaviors of the actin cytoskeleton is critical for delineating 26 mechanical behaviors of cells . The actin cytoskeleton consists of interconnected actin filaments 27 ( F - actin ) that form via self - assembly of actin monomers . It has been shown that molecular 28 changes of the monomer subunits impact the rigidity of F - actin . However , it remains 29 inconclusive whether or not the molecular changes can propagate to the network level and thus 30 alter the rheological properties of actin networks . Here , we focus on how cation binding and 31 nucleotide state tune the molecular conformation and rigidity of F - actin and a representative 32 rheological behavior of actin networks , strain - stiffening . We employ a multiscale approach by 33 combining established computational techniques : molecular dynamics , normal mode analysis , 34 and Brownian dynamics . Our findings indicate that different combinations of nucleotide ( ATP , 35 ADP or ADP - Pi ) and cation ( Mg 2 + or Ca 2 + at one or multiple sites ) binding change the molecular 36 conformation of F - actin by varying inter - and intra - strand interactions which bridge adjacent 37 subunits between and within F - actin helical strands . This is reflected in the rigidity of actin 38 filaments against bending and stretching . We found that differences in extension and bending 39 rigidity of F - actin induced by cation binding to the low - , intermediate - and high - affinity sites 40 vary the strain - stiffening response of actin networks crosslinked by rigid crosslinkers , such as 41 scruin , whereas they minimally impact the strain - stiffening response when compliant 42 crosslinkers , such as filamin A or α - actinin , are used . 43 44 Keywords 45 actin , filament , network , rheology , cation , multiscale model 46 2 INTRODUCTION 47 48 The cytoskeleton is an interconnected network of filamentous semiflexible polymers regulating 49 the responses of cells to external deformations ( Wang et al . 1993 ; Bausch et al . 1999 ) . Actin is 50 the most abundant protein of the cytoskeleton and is deeply involved with cell mechano - sensing . 51 Actin undergoes transitions between monomeric ( G - actin ) and filamentous states ( F - actin ) 52 during processes such as changes in cell shape and migration ( Korn et al . 1987 ; Borisy and 53 Svitkina 2000 ; Bunnell et al . 2001 ) . During these transitions , the microstructure of F - actin , a 54 double - stranded helix consisting of monomer subunits , experiences conformational 55 rearrangements owing to polymerization , nucleotide hydrolysis and cation exchanges at multiple 56 sites ( Cooper et al . 1983 ; Estes et al . 1987 ; Zimmerle et al . 1987 ; Méjean et al . 1988 ; Strzelecka - 57 Gołaszewska et al . 1993 ; Strzelecka - Golaszewska et al . 1996 ; Moraczewska et al . 1996 ; 58 Moraczewska et al . 1999 ; Guan et al . 2003 ) . The inherent coupling between actin subunit 59 conformation and the rigidity of actin filaments and networks makes it critical to explore actin 60 conformations responsible for different mechanical behaviors of cells . 61 Each monomer subunit along F - actin has a nucleotide binding site , a high - affinity cation - binding 62 site ( Estes et al . 1992a ) and at least three intermediate - and low - affinity divalent - cation - binding 63 sites ( Zimmerle et al . 1987 ) ( Fig . 1a ) . In physiological conditions , actin exists in multiple 64 conformations , bound to one or several cations and with either ATP , ADP or intermediate ADP - 65 Pi , and exhibits various filament properties . For example , the dynamics ( Korn et al . 1987 ; Estes 66 et al . 1992a ) and rigidity of F - actin ( Kang et al . 2012 ) are altered by ATP hydrolysis and cation 67 exchanges . Also , a significant correlation exists between ATP hydrolysis and the type of cation 68 bound to the high - affinity site ( Carlier et al . 1986 ; Carlier et al . 1987 ; Estes et al . 1992b ) . It was 69 shown that upon exchange of Ca 2 + for Mg 2 + at the high - affinity binding site , the nucleotide - 70 binding cleft tends to be open ( Nyitrai 1999 ) , whereas Ca 2 + induces a bridge of increased density 71 between the two strands of F - actin ( Orlova and Egelman 1995 ) . With binding of multiple cations 72 at the low - and intermediate - affinity sites , the interface area of monomer subunits increases due 73 to lower electrostatic repulsions between adjacent subunits ( Janmey 1996 ; Shi et al . 2007 ) , and 74 the number of inter - monomer contacts also increases ( De La Cruz et al . 2010 ) . One area of 75 interest is the hypothesis that different molecular conformations of the subunits favor specific 76 inter - subunit interactions which in turn affect macroscopic filament properties ( Chu and Voth 77 2006a ; Pfaendtner et al . 2010 ; De La Cruz et al . 2010 ; Saunders and Voth 2012 ) . Previous 78 studies have shown that molecular - level heterogeneities in both the dynamics of a single subunit 79 and the interactions between subunits along the filaments are critical to filament rigidity ( Fan et 80 al . 2012 ) . It is likely that cation binding , at low - , intermediate - , and high - affinity sites , and 81 nucleotide hydrolysis complementarily affect the molecular heterogeneity and macroscopic 82 stiffness of F - actin , and that this impacts the rheology of crosslinked actin networks . We 83 previously demonstrated that the stiffness of F - actin is controlled by rearrangements of specific 84 groups of residues in the subunits , as they weaken or stabilize monomer - to - monomer interactions 85 ( Deriu et al . 2011 ) , but we did not consider the different configurations of the F - actin with 86 nucleotides and nucleotide / cation ( s ) binding . 87 Within cells , F - actins are crosslinked into a network by various crosslinking proteins such as α – 88 actinin ( Xu et al . 2000 ) , filamin A ( Gardel et al . 2006b ; Schmoller et al . 2009 ) and scruin ( Shin 89 et al . 2004 ) , whose density , binding activity , and mechanical properties modulate the network 90 viscoelasticity ( Schnurr et al . 1997 ; Tseng et al . 2002 ; Gardel et al . 2006a ; Tharmann et al . 2007 ; 91 Schmoller et al . 2009 ; Lieleg et al . 2009 ; Kim et al . 2009b ; Lieleg et al . 2010 ; Unterberger et al . 92 3 2013 ) . Properties of F - actin including concentration and mechanical stiffness can also play an 93 important role in modulating network elasticity ( MacKintosh et al . 1995 ; Grooman et al . 2012 ) . 94 Indeed , we demonstrated that variations in extensional and bending stiffnesses of F - actin highly 95 affect the shear modulus of a crosslinked network ( Kim et al . 2009b ) . Therefore , binding of 96 cations and nucleotides can impact not only the molecular conformation and stiffness of the F - 97 actin but also have potential to affect mechanical behaviors of crosslinked actin networks . 98 Despite the previous efforts , how the conformational rearrangements of monomer subunits and 99 F - actins propagate from the molecular level up to the network level is still unclear . Here , we 100 hypothesized that cation binding and nucleotide hydrolysis complementarily affect F - actin 101 stiffness and that this , in turn , impacts a representative rheological behavior of crosslinked actin 102 networks , strain - stiffening . To test the hypothesis , we employed a multiscale approach by 103 combining three computational models , spanning length and time scales from angstroms to 104 micrometers and from nanoseconds to seconds . By applying the multiscale model , we 105 investigated how molecular differences resulting from various combinations of nucleotide and 106 cation ( s ) may propagate from monomer subunits to F - actin and tune F - actin mechanics and how 107 these affect strain - stiffening of a crosslinked actin network . In detail , we examined ( 1 ) whether 108 changes in bending and extensional rigidity of F - actin are correlated with the equilibrium 109 conformation resulting from binding of cations at the low - , intermediate - and / or high - affinity site 110 in different nucleotide forms ; ( 2 ) whether these changes in F - actin rigidity impact the strain - 111 stiffening of crosslinked actin networks . 112 113 114 METHODS 115 116 In this study , for a multiscale computational approach , ( 1 ) at the atomistic level , we used 117 equilibrium molecular dynamics ( MD ) simulations in order to predict the conformational 118 modifications of subunits along F - actin induced by binding of one or more cations in various 119 nucleotide states ; ( 2 ) at the filament level , we applied the anisotropic network model ( ANM ) 120 together with the rotation translation block ( RTB ) approach in order to compute bending and 121 extensional rigidities of F - actin ; ( 3 ) at the network level , we conducted Brownian dynamics ( BD ) 122 simulations of a crosslinked actin filament network using an agent - based model . The link 123 between these methods was given by the fact that each of them drew upon the output of the one 124 at the smaller scale , by applying a bottom - up approach . 125 126 Atomistic level : molecular dynamics simulations 127 11 configurations of the actin monomer were defined , varying in terms of the bound nucleotide 128 and nucleotide / cation ( s ) : ATP - G - actin , ADP - G - actin , ADP - Pi - G - actin , ATP - 1Mg 2 + - G - actin , 129 ATP - 1Ca 2 + - G - actin , ATP - 6Mg 2 + - G - actin , ATP - 6Ca 2 + - G - actin , ADP - 1Mg 2 + - G - actin , ADP - 130 1Ca 2 + - G - actin , ADP - 6Mg 2 + - G - actin , ADP - 6Ca 2 + - G - actin . The atomic coordinates of G - actin 131 were obtained from the X - ray fiber diffraction structure reported in the RCSB protein data bank , 132 2zwh . pdb ( Oda et al . 2009 ) . The DB loop in the ADP - G - actin configurations was reconstructed 133 using the atomic coordinates from 1j6z . pdb ( Otterbein et al . 2001 ) , by superimposition , in order 134 to reproduce the folded configuration of this region in the ADP - state . Positions of six calcium , 135 Ca 2 + ( or magnesium , Mg 2 + ) ions were taken from the crystallographic coordinates of 1j6z . pdb 136 ( Otterbein et al . 2001 ) ( Fig . 1a ) . Atomic coordinates for ATP were taken from X - ray 137 crystallography structure 1atn . pdb ( Kabsch et al . 1990 ) , after structural fitting . The monomer 138 4 subunits were arranged according to the microfilament model from ( Grudinin and Redon 2010 ) , 139 as in ( Deriu et al . 2012 ) ( Fig . 1b ) . A repeat - unit of F - actin was placed in a rectangular box of 13 140 nm × 13nm × 37 . 5nm ( Fig . 1c ) , with long axis parallel to z . Periodic boundary conditions were 141 activated on xyz ( Fig . 1d ) , maintaining along x and y a distance between the filament and its 142 periodic images of at least 2 nm . The SPC model was used to simulate water molecules in the 143 box . 5000 steps of energy minimization were applied using the steepest descent algorithm and a 144 position restrain MD of about 50 ps was performed in isothermal - isobaric ensemble with the 145 protein backbone restrained by a force constant of 1000 kJ mol - 1 nm - 2 . The NVT simulations 146 were performed in a NVT ensamble at 300 K for 12 ns , as in ( Deriu et al . 2012 ) . All simulations 147 were carried out with GROMACS 4 ( Hess et al . 2008 ) using the G53a6 force - field ( Oostenbrink 148 et al . 2005 ) . Electrostatic interactions were calculated with the Particle - Mesh Ewald method with 149 a short - range electrostatic interaction cut off of 1 nm . A cut - off of 1 nm was also applied to 150 Lennard - Jones interactions . The virtual site approach together with the LINCS constraint solver 151 ( Hess et al . 1997 ) allowed us to use a time step of 4 fs for the MD . 152 The Visual Molecular Dynamics ( VMD ) ( Humphrey et al . 1996 ) package was employed for 153 visual inspection and dedicated tools were developed in MATLAB for quantitative structural 154 analysis . The output of equilibrium MD was analyzed using four parameters : the filament 155 diameter , the distance between centers of mass of functional subdomains of adjacent monomer 156 subunits ( both inter - and intra - strand distances ) , the width of the nucleotide binding cleft and the 157 dihedral angle . Our definition of subdomains followed the four subdomain ( SD1 - 4 ) description 158 of ( Chu and Voth 2006a ) ( Fig . 2a ) . Parameters were reported in terms of average value and 159 standard deviation between the 13 monomers of F - actin , giving a measure of the degree of 160 heterogeneity of each configuration . We quantified how “closed” the nucleotide cleft was in two 161 different ways : ( 1 ) by computing the distances between the centers of mass of the protein 162 backbone of residues 57 - 69 , 30 - 33 in SD2 and 203 - 216 in SD4 ( Wriggers and Schulten 1997 ) ; 163 ( 2 ) by measuring the distance between the mass centers of SD2 and SD4 ( Splettstoesser et al . 164 2009 ; Düttmann et al . 2012 ) . 165 166 Filament level : elastic network - based normal mode analysis 167 We used the 13 - monomers repeat unit of F - actin from the MD output configurations ( at 12 nm ) 168 to build filaments of 150 nm length , using rigid translations along z . The atomic model of each 169 filament was then replaced by an Elastic Network Model ( ENM ) ( Atilgan et al . 2001 ; 170 Chennubhotla et al . 2005 ; Yang and Chng 2008 ) , composed of nodes ( points with a mass , 171 identified by the protein Cα atoms ) and springs . Nodes were connected by harmonic potentials of 172 1 kcal / molA 2 , if closer than a cut - off distance of 1 . 2 nm ( Doruker et al . 2000 ; Atilgan et al . 2001 ) 173 ( Fig . 1e ) . We applied the Rotation Translation Block ( RTB ) method ( Philippe Durand et al . , 174 1994 ; Tama et al . , 2005 ; Tama et al . , 2000 ; Tama et al . , 2001 ) . Blocks were defined based on the 175 functional subdivision of each actin monomer into four subdomains , in order to preserve the 176 basic topology of the actin subunit at the filament level ( Fig . 1f ) . This approach was considered 177 since the filament has ~ 20000 Cα’s and slow dynamics , with low frequency modes ( around 10 - 1 178 cm ) of interest . Also , since shear effects are negligible for an actin filament in deflection , we 179 treated it as a homogenous and isotropic rod . From the frequencies associated with specific 180 modes , the bending and extensional rigidities of F - actin were computed , as described in 181 Supplementary Information . 182 183 184 5 Network level : Brownian dynamics simulations 185 We imported the bending and extensional rigidities of F - actin calculated by RTB under the 186 different cation / nucleotide bound states into the agent - based model of a crosslinked actin 187 network as input ( Fig . 1g ) . Details about the network model can be found in our previous studies 188 ( Kim et al . 2009a ; Kim 2014 ) and in Supplementary Information . Briefly , the model consists of 189 F - actin and actin crosslinking proteins ( ACPs ) . F - actin is modeled as a series of cylindrical 190 segments of 140 nm in length and 7 nm in diameter , connected by elastic hinges . Harmonic 191 potentials with extensional stiffness , k s , and bending stiffness , k f , obtained from RTB maintain 192 the equilibrium length of actin cylindrical segments and keep the adjacent segments aligned in 193 parallel , respectively . ACPs comprise two cylindrical segments of 23 . 5 nm in length and 10 nm 194 in diameter connected serially by elastic hinges , forming permanent crosslinks between pairs of 195 F - actins without preference of crosslinking angle by binding to sites located every 7 nm on the 196 actin segment . We used two different values for extensional stiffness of ACPs , k s , ACP = 2×10 - 3 197 ( compliant ) or 0 . 2 N / m ( rigid ) , to maintain the equilibrium length of ACP segments . Bending 198 stiffnesses of ACPs , k f , ACP1 = 1 . 45×10 - 25 Nm 2 and k f , ACP2 = 5 . 8×10 - 25 Nm 2 keep two ACP 199 segments aligned in parallel and maintain an angle formed by an ACP segment and F - actin close 200 to the right angle , respectively . Displacements of the actin and ACP segments are governed by 201 the Langevin equation with stochastic forces , drag forces , and deterministic forces including the 202 bending and extensional forces as well as repulsive forces between the actin segments 203 accounting for volume - exclusion effects . Within a cubical computational domain whose width is 204 3 µm , actin and ACP segments in a monomeric state interact with each other by defined potential 205 energies with a periodic boundary condition in all directions . It leads to the formation of a 206 network whose average filament length is 1 . 2 μm , actin concentration is 20 µM , and relative 207 density of ACPs ( R ACP ) is 0 . 01 . Then , F - actins passing through the boundaries in z direction ( Fig . 208 1d ) are severed and permanently clamped with the periodic boundary condition deactivated . To 209 simulate a strain - stiffening behavior , the domain is subjected to shear deformation by 210 translocating the top z boundary with a constant rate ( 0 . 1 s - 1 ) while the bottom z boundary is 211 fixed ( Fig . 1h ) . Stress is calculated by dividing the sum of forces acting on the clamped filaments 212 by area of the z boundary . The strain - stiffening behavior of the crosslinked actin networks was 213 compared between cases with various combinations of nucleotide and cation ( s ) . 214 215 216 RESULTS 217 218 Saturation of cation binding affects inter - and intra - strand F - actin interactions 219 Both inter - and intra - strand interactions between subdomains varied with a bound nucleotide or 220 nucleotide / cation ( s ) , especially for ADP - 6Mg 2 + - F - actins , corresponding to the physiological 221 condition of F - actin in contractile muscle cells ( Estes et al . 1992a ) . A schematic representation of 222 a 3 - monomers F - actin with coarse - grained subunits is shown in Fig . 2a , where each node 223 corresponds to the mass center of one subdomain . 224 Repositioning of the mass centers of the subunit subdomains lead to a reduction of F - actin 225 diameter of about 15 % , in both ADP - and ATP - F - actin ( values reported in Supplementary Table 226 1 ) . Saturation of Mg 2 + at low - and intermediate - affinity binding sites enhanced this reduction 227 ( Fig . 2b ) , due to the repositioning of SD1 relative to SD1 of monomers i and i + 1 ( Fig . 2c ) . This 228 effect is consistent with the role that bound cations have in increasing the rigidity of SD1 , which 229 causes its shift ( Nyitrai 1999 ) . 230 6 A stabilizing effect was observed with cation saturation : mean values and standard deviations of 231 distances between mass centers of subdomains were generally smaller than those of the 232 corresponding cation - free and single - cation - bound F - actins . This effect was more marked in 233 ADP - F - actin ( Fig . 2c , d and e ) , and occurred in ATP - F - actin for the inter - strand distance 234 between SD1 and SD1 ( Fig . 2c ) and for the intra - strand distance between SD2 and SD1 ( Fig . 235 2e ) . It is conceivable that this effect is a consequence of reduced repulsions between subunits due 236 to an increased number of bound cations ( Janmey 1996 ; Kwon et al . 2005 ; Shi et al . 2007 ) . In 237 ATP - F - actin , intra - stand distances were also more heterogeneous with a single bound cation of 238 either type ( Fig . 2e ) , but inter - strand distances were more heterogeneous only with tightly bound 239 Ca 2 + ( Fig . 2c and d ) . This effect can be related to the weaker coupling of Mg 2 + with ATP , 240 compared to that of Ca 2 + ( Nyitrai 1999 ) . 241 At the end of the simulation period , the mass centers of SD2 and SD1 of subunits located in the 242 same strand ( monomers i and i + 2 ) were closer by 3 . 3 % in ATP - F - actins and 4 . 8 % in ADP - F - 243 actin ( Fig . 2e ) , reflecting the unfolded or folded DB - loop’s in ATP - and ADP - F - actin , 244 respectively . In the case of the intermediate ADP - Pi - F - actin , the spacing within a filament was 245 heterogeneous in the center of mass distances between SD2 and SD1 of adjacent longitudinal 246 subunits ( Fig . 2e ) , while distances between opposite SD1 / SD1 and SD4 / SD1 were more uniform 247 ( Fig . 2c and d ) . Unbinding of the γ – phosphate from the nucleotide leads to F - actin compaction 248 along its diameter ( Fig . 2b ) without heterogeneous coupling between longitudinal monomers 249 ( Fig . 2e ) . 250 251 Cation saturation increases variability in dihedral angle and nucleotide cleft size 252 The dihedral angle ( indicated by an arrow in Fig . 3a ) decreased in the range 0 . 7 - 1 . 4 % for ATP - , 253 ADP - and ADP - Pi - filaments ( Fig . 3b ) . Estimates of the average dihedral angle for each F - actin 254 are listed in Supplementary Table 1 . 255 The binding of either Ca 2 + or Mg 2 + to the low - and intermediate - affinity sites of both ATP and 256 ADP filaments increased the variance of the dihedral angle with respect to the corresponding 257 configurations with only the high - affinity site occupied ( Fig . 3b ) . This effect is opposite to that 258 of the cations on the inter - and intra - strand subunit interactions : saturation of cation binding 259 sites made ADP - F - actin more uniform in intra - and inter - strand monomer subunit interactions 260 ( Fig . 2c , d , and e ) . This result suggests that cation saturation may induce stabilization of inter and 261 intra - subunit interactions while allowing heterogeneous repositioning of the two major 262 subdomains of the monomer subunit ( the largest one including SD1 and SD2 , the smallest one 263 including SD3 and SD4 ) along the filament . This result is in agreement with the observed effect 264 of multiple cations in reducing electrostatic repulsions between subunits ( Janmey 1996 ; Kwon et 265 al . 2005 ; Shi et al . 2007 ) . 266 Interactions of low - and intermediate - affinity cations were weaker than those of the high - affinity 267 cations ( Fig . 3c ) and the amplitude of cation fluctuations was independent of the type of bound 268 nucleotide ( Fig . S1 ) . However , the type of bound cation had a direct effect on the dimension of 269 the cleft between the two major domains of the subunit ( Fig . 3d and e ) . A detailed comparison 270 between cleft openings in systems with ADP , ATP and ADP - Pi can be found in the 271 Supplementary Information . Fig 3d - e show that after release of Pi , the cleft is more stable in an 272 open conformation , consistent with previous MD simulations ( Pfaendtner et al . 2009 ) . The 273 presence of only the tightly bound cation , either Ca 2 + or Mg 2 + , in ADP - F - actin , lead to an 274 increase of the cleft opening relative to the cation - free F - actin , and if saturation of all cation 275 7 binding sites occurred , this opening was more accentuated ( Fig . 3e ) . By contrast , in ATP - F - actin , 276 the cleft was greater only with saturation of Ca 2 + ( Fig . 3e ) . 277 278 Binding of nucleotide / cation ( s ) minimally impact the extensional and bending rigidities of 279 F - actin 280 In both ATP - and ADP - bound forms , Mg 2 + - F - actin was less rigid than Ca 2 + - F - actin if only the 281 high - affinity cation binding site was occupied , ( Fig . 4 ) . For ADP - F - actin , bending rigidity was 282 also slightly reduced when the low - and intermediate - affinity binding sites were occupied . An 283 opposite effect was observed with the binding of multiple cations on ATP - F - actin , where the 284 Mg 2 + - F - actin was more rigid in bending than Ca 2 + - F - actin . Cation saturation in Mg 2 + - ATP - F - 285 actin also led to enhanced variability in inter - strand distances between SD4 / SD1 ( Fig . 2d ) . 286 The variation in extensional rigidity between the different nucleotide and nucleotide / cation ( s ) 287 bound forms reflected changes in bending rigidity , except for Ca 2 + saturation , where ADP - F - 288 actin was more rigid in extension than ATP - F - actin ( Fig . 4a ) . Values for flexural and extensional 289 rigidities of each system are given in Supplementary Table 3 . 290 The variance of the root mean square distance of the monomer subunits α - carbons from the 291 average structure in each conditions of bound nucleotide and nucleotide / cation ( s ) mirrors 292 differences in filament persistence length ( Fig . 4c ) . Therefore , increased anisotropy corresponds 293 to increased F - actin rigidity . 294 295 296 Cation binding at low - , intermediate - , and high - affinity sites can affect strain - stiffening of a 297 crosslinked actin network depending on crosslinker stiffness 298 Values of bending and extensional stiffnesses of F - actin calculated under different nucleotide 299 and cation binding using RTB were imported to k s and k f in our model for crosslinked actin 300 networks . We compared the strain - stiffening behavior between 11 cases with various k s and k f 301 using either soft or rigid ACPs . In all the sampled cases , we observe a tendency that shear stress 302 increases in direct proportion to shear strain below ~ 0 . 5 strain while stress rapidly diverges 303 above the critical strain , determining the onset of nonlinear stiffening ( Fig . 5a , b , c , d ) . As shown 304 in Fig . 5a , with soft ACPs , the strain - stiffening curves of the 11 cases did not show statistically 305 significant differences ( average p - value = 0 . 88 , with 95 % confidence ) . This is because k s 306 corresponding to all values of l p was much higher than k s , ACP which mimics the mechanical 307 properties of filamin A and α - actinin ( Golji et al . 2009 ) . In other words , the actin cylindrical 308 segments connected in F - actin with very high k s would behave like rigid rods , whereas the ACPs 309 connecting the actin segments would act as soft spring . Then , since the network - level response 310 will be dominated by mechanical response of the ACPs , a change in k s will lead to the minimal 311 alteration in the strain - stiffening behavior as we observed . By contrast , with stiff ACPs , strain - 312 stiffening curves were statistically different ( average p - value = 0 . 03 , with 95 % confidence ) 313 ( Fig . 5b ) . Although any of our sampled cases with binding of low - , intermediate - and high - 314 affinity cations in various nucleotide states did not substantially affect the strain - stiffening 315 behavior with soft ACPs , it is still possible that binding of cations at a different site can lead to 316 significant changes in the network rheology . Thus , we extended our scope by incorporating a 317 large increase in l p which results from discrete binding of Mg 2 + to the so - called “stiffness” site 318 identified by a combination of microscopic techniques with image analysis approaches ( Kang et 319 al . 2012 ) . They found that l p is elevated from 2 . 1 to 12 . 7 µm when concentration of MgCl 2 is 320 increased from 0 . 5 to 5 mM . We estimated values of k s and k f from the measured l p with 321 assumption of an ideal polymer chain and elastic rod theory , and incorporated them into our 322 8 network model . We observed a statistically significant difference between strain - stiffening 323 curves even with soft ACPs ( average p - value < 0 . 01 ) ( Fig . 5c ) ; the largest difference the curves 324 was about 25 % at high strains . This effect was highly magnified with stiffer ACPs ; stress with 325 the highest l p was 3 - fold greater than that with the lowest l p ( Fig . 5d ) . Differences in network 326 elasticity at high strains are illustrated in Fig . 5e ( soft ACP ) and Fig . 5f ( rigid ACP ) . 327 328 329 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS 330 331 In this study , we used a multiscale computational approach in order to investigate the effect of 332 the molecular conformation of F - actin on filament rigidity and on the elasticity of a crosslinked 333 actin network . We used as case study models of F - actin bound to a nucleotide ( ATP , ADP or 334 ADP - Pi ) in combination with one or multiple cations ( Ca 2 + , Mg 2 + ) . We first employed MD 335 simulations and RTB analysis to compute F - actin rigidity . Then , we incorporated the results into 336 our model of crosslinked actin network . This study is novel in that it presents the first 337 combination of computational techniques addressing the conformational and mechanical 338 properties of the actin structure from the molecular rearrangement of monomer subunits in F - 339 actins up to strain - induced stiffening of a network composed of numerous F - actin filaments . 340 Advantages of this computational approach arise from passing information from one level of 341 modeling to the other , thus enabling us to study the actin structures at multiple temporal and 342 spatial scales . 343 Different monomer conformations varying for bound nucleotide and nucleotide / cation ( s ) resulted 344 in different intra - strand ( longitudinal contacts ) and inter - strand ( lateral contacts ) distances 345 between subdomains along the same filament , which affected the dihedral angle per subunit , and 346 conversely , changes in the dihedral angle of subunits induced different inter - and intra - strand 347 distances between subdomains . In ADP - F - actin , saturation of binding sites led ( 1 ) to a reduction 348 in heterogeneity of the inter - and intra - subdomain distances and ( 2 ) to an increased 349 heterogeneity in the dihedral angles ( Fig . 3a , b ) . On the contrary , for ATP - bound filaments , with 350 either one or multiple cations , inter - and intra - strand subunit distances were always observed to 351 be heterogeneous among the 13 monomer subunits in the filament model . This gave rise to 352 filaments more rigid in bending ( up to 12 % stiffer ) compared to the analogous systems in the 353 ADP - bound form , consistent with experimental results ( Gittes et al . 1993 ; Ott et al . 1993 ; 354 Kojima et al . 1994 ; Isambert et al . 1995 ; Belmont et al . 1999 ) as well as computational 355 characterizations ( Chu and Voth 2005 ; Splettstoesser et al . 2009 ) , reporting changes in rigidity of 356 about 24 % ( Isambert et al . 1995 ) and 16 - 45 % ( Chu and Voth 2006b ) , respectively . Overall , 357 variations in the Cα positions per actin subunit resulting from MD led to heterogeneities along 358 the filaments which mirror the changes in rigidity ( Fig 4a , c ) . We compared our MD - refined 359 subunits with Oda’s , Fujii’s , and Murakami’s models of actin ( Fig . S2 ) , which were obtained in 360 different solutions conditions , Ca 2 + - ADP , Mg 2 + - ADP and Mg 2 + - ADP Pi , respectively . Among 361 the tested actin configurations , the monomer subunit closest to the Murakami’s model 362 ( Murakami et al . 2010 ) at the output of MD was ADP - Pi - G - actin ( RMSD 3 . 6 Å , see Table S5 ) . 363 Our Ca 2 + - ADP - subunits had smaller RMSD of Cα atoms ( 4 . 03 or 3 . 60 Å ) from the Oda’s model 364 ( Oda et al . 2009 ) than from the Fujii’s ( Fujii et al . 2010 ) or Murakami’s models ( RMSD > 4 . 09 365 or 3 . 91 Å , see Table S5 ) . Similarly , our Mg 2 + - ADP - subunits showed smaller RMSD of Cα 366 atoms ( 3 . 25 or 3 . 89 Å ) from the Fujii’s model than from the Oda’s or Murakami’s models 367 ( RMSD > 3 . 83 or 4 . 04 Å , see Table S5 ) . These results are consistent with the different solution 368 conditions used to obtain the above mentioned actin models . In addition , the smallest RMSD of 369 9 Cα pertaining to SD2 corresponded to that of Mg 2 + - ADP - subunit from the Fujii’s model ( see 370 Table S4 ) , owing to the replacement of SD2 in 2zwh . pdb . The binding of the sole high - affinity 371 Ca 2 + resulted able to keep the monomer in its flat configuration in ATP - F - actin , whereas if Mg 2 + 372 was tightly bound to ATP - F - actin , the dihedral angle was reduced ( Fig . 3b ) . This unflattened 373 configuration may be related to the faster polymerization rate observed in ATP - F - actin tightly 374 bound to Mg 2 + ( Selden et al . 1983 ) . When the transition from ATP - Pi - F - actin to ADP - F - actin 375 occurred in the presence of tightly bound Mg 2 + the configuration of the subunit returned to the 376 flattened state ( increase in dihedral angle ) , which is the form of the monomer subunit in a 377 double - stranded helix ( Oda et al . 2009 ) . Our findings suggest that for monomer subunits 378 saturated with cations , the opening of the nucleotide cleft due to hydrolysis leads to a reduction 379 in the subunit average dihedral angles ( Fig . 2b ) , and consequently to thinner ADP - F - actins with 380 decreased rigidity ( Fig . 4a ) . 381 In general , saturation of cation binding sites induced a change in the persistence length of F - actin 382 from 3 . 5 to 4 µm , depending on the nucleotide and nucleotide / cation ( s ) ( Fig . 4 ) . Recent 383 experimental data have shown that specific cation binding to the actin filament can be related to 384 changes in its bending rigidity from about 3 to 12 μm , depending upon the Ca 2 + or Mg 2 + 385 concentration in the solution and the site of binding ( Kang et al . 2012 ) . Our results indicate 386 values of persistence length at the lower end of this range , since none of the cations here used is 387 bound to the so - called “stiffness” site detected in ( Kang et al . 2012 ) and responsible for 388 pronounced changes in filament rigidity . Earlier studies have shown that bending rigidity of 389 Mg 2 + - F - actin is about four times lower than Ca 2 + actin ( Orlova and Egelman 1995 ) . However , 390 spectroscopic experiments showed that Ca 2 + - F - actin are less rigid in bending that Mg 2 + - F - actin 391 ( Hild et al . 1998 ) . Also , other studies found essentially no cation dependence of the flexibility of 392 filaments using either dynamic light scattering measurements ( Scharf and Newman 1995 ) , or 393 other techniques ( Isambert et al . 1995 ; Steinmetz et al . 1997 ) to determine F - actin persistence 394 length . Our results corroborate these last studies and together with the evidences from ( Kang et 395 al . 2012 ) support that precise location of cation binding , different from low - , intermediate - and 396 high - affinity sites , can be responsible for the pronounced changes in F - actin rigidity detected in 397 ( Kang et al . 2012 ) . 398 Existence of cations at low - , intermediate - , and high - affinity sites used in the present study 399 minimally influenced F - actin stiffness and did not significantly affect strain - stiffening of 400 networks with soft ACPs that mimic filamin A and α - actinin . It is expected that overall stiffness 401 of a network consisting of rigid and soft elements is determined largely by the soft elements 402 which are the crosslinkers in this case , and then the network stiffness would be insensitive to 403 slight changes in the rigidity of the stiff elements which are the actin filaments . However , the 404 same cation binding markedly varied network strain - stiffening when ACPs are as stiff as actin 405 filaments , like scruin , since the contribution of actin filaments to the network stiffness becomes 406 significant under this condition . In our previous work ( Kim et al . 2009b ) , storage shear modulus , 407 G ’ , of a crosslinked actin network showed a noticeable change in response to a 25 - fold decrease 408 in the extensional and bending stiffness of actin filaments because we used extensional stiffness 409 of actin filaments that is only 4 - fold greater than that of compliant ACPs in order to decrease 410 computational costs . Bending stiffness of actin filaments was set to be smaller than that of ACPs . 411 This is consistent with our current results in that the strain - stiffening is highly influenced by a 412 change in actin - filament rigidity only when actin filaments and ACPs have comparable rigidity . 413 Furthermore , using the values of F - actin persistence length reported in ( Kang et al . 2012 ) 414 10 originating from Mg 2 + binding to the monomer “stiffness” site made strain - stiffening curves of 415 the crosslinked actin networks statistically different even with soft ACPs . 416 Based on this finding , we conclude that : ( 1 ) alterations in F - actin rigidity induced by binding of 417 one or multiple cations at the low - , intermediate - , or high - affinity sites can impact the strain - 418 stiffening of actin networks depending on whether ACPs are stiff or compliant ; ( 2 ) binding of 419 cations at specific “stiffening” locations between adjacent subunits is reflected not only at the 420 filament level ( Kang et al . 2012 ) , but also at the network level regardless of rigidity of ACPs . In 421 the context of cell mechanics , our overall results suggest that the binding of one or multiple 422 cations in the different nucleotide - bound forms of F - actin should be considered as a potential 423 mechanism for cell’s ability to modulate the mechanical properties of the cytoskeleton 424 crosslinked by very rigid ACPs . 425 Numerous computational studies have shown that F - actin bending is important at low shear 426 strain , whereas extension plays a significant role at high shear strain ( Head et al . 2003 ; Onck et 427 al . 2005 ; Broedersz and Mackintosh 2014 ) . Considering that most ACPs form reversible 428 crosslinks which lead to the collapse of stress during strain - stiffening before reaching high 429 strains ( Wagner et al . 2006 ; Gardel et al . 2006c ; Kim et al . 2011 ) , the change in extensional 430 stiffness induced by the cation binding might be less important for rheology of cells than that in 431 bending stiffness . In addition , although the cation binding shows a negligible effect on network 432 rheology with compliant ACPs at concentration and length of F - actin tested here , it still has 433 potential to result in high impact on network elasticity at regimes where actin concentration and 434 filament length are significantly different due to actin dynamics regulated by various proteins 435 and / or molecules . For example , regarding Mg 2 + or Ca 2 + binding , previous studies demonstrated 436 that Mg 2 + - ATP - actin polymerizes about two times faster than Ca 2 + - ATP - actin ( Selden et al . 437 1983 ; Carlier et al . 1986 ; Estes et al . 1987 ; Estes et al . 1992a ) , and the resulting increased 438 filament length can induce differences in network rheology between Mg 2 + and Ca 2 + - networks 439 even with compliant ACPs . As a focus for future work , studies of cation binding within the SD2 440 domain may reveal larger changes in stiffness than those observed in our study . Also , 441 incorporation of torsional rigidity into the actin network model and characterization of the 442 bending - torsional coupling relative to strain - stiffening behavior may reveal differences in 443 network elasticity brought by low - , intermediate - , and high - affinity cation binding . 444 445 446 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS 447 448 We gratefully acknowledge a fellowship from the MITOR program to TCB . 449 450 11 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION 451 452 Extracting mechanical properties of the actin filaments from Normal Mode Analysis 453 Normal Mode Analysis ( NMA ) is a powerful approach for analyzing the structural and 454 dynamical features of macromolecules such as actin filaments ( Tirion 1996 ; Bahar and Rader 455 2005 ; Hinsen 2005 ; Dykeman and Sankey 2010 ) . Although it is approximate because only the 456 harmonic motions of the system around a single potential minimum is considered , the low 457 frequency normal modes can be directly related to the mechanical behavior of the protein under 458 the assumption of homogenous and isotropic material ( Flynn and Ma 2004 ; Park et al . 2006 ; 459 Adamovic et al . 2008 ) . In our study , we first represent the filament structure as a network of Cα 460 atoms locally connected by springs . Then , we ignore local flexibilities of selected groups of Cα 461 by defining rigid blocks and applying an approximation of the NMA method in order to extract 462 the mechanical properties of F - actin , Rotation Translation Block ( RTB ) approach . Before 463 describing how the RTB method approximates NMA analysis , we provide here in the following 464 some details about NMA . We will illustrate how mechanical properties can be related to 465 frequencies of vibration associated with specific modes of motion of the actin filament , thought 466 NMA . 467 Considering F - actin as a linear elastic material , its mechanical behavior can be related to its 468 status of deformation and characterized by : stiffness in bending , also called flexural rigidity k f ; 469 and stiffness in elongation , k s . For small deformations , the components of displacement , 470 expressed as functions of axial coordinate ( e . g . , z ) and time t , satisfy wave equations for both 471 bending displacement u f ( z , t ) and stretching displacement u s ( z , t ) : 472 473 4 4 2 2 ) , ( ) , ( z t z u k t t z u f f f       ( S1 ) 474 475 2 2 2 2 ) , ( ) , ( z t z u k t t z u s s s       ( S2 ) 476 477 where ρ is the mass per length unit of F - actin , of about 2 . 3 10 - 16 Kg / m and ρ v is its mass per unit 478 volume , of about 11 . 6 Kg / m 3 .

In the case of NMA , the filament is not clamped , so the correspondent boundary 495 conditions , both in bending or stretching are u’ f , s ( 0 ) = 0 and u’’ f , s ( L ) = 0 , where L is the length of 496 the filament . 497 Considering the bending modes , the corresponding solution for a filament free to vibrate in a 498 three dimensional space is given by : 499     tn i n n n n n n n n n n f e z w z w z w z w z w z w z w z w a t z u               ) sinh ( ) sin ( ) sinh ( ) sin ( ) cosh ( ) cos ( ) cosh ( ) cos ( ) , ( ( S7 ) 500 501 with wave number w n given by the relation : 502 503 1 ) cosh ( ) cos (   L w L w n n ( S8 ) 504 505 With negligible viscous drag , the amplitude a n of the n th mode is determined by the initial 506 conformation of the filament . 507 Considering the stretching modes , the corresponding solution is given by : 508 509 t n i n n n s e z w a t z u    ) cos ( ) , ( ( S9 ) 510 511 512 with wave number w n for the n th mode given by : 513 514 L n w n   ( S10 ) 515 516 Once extracted the normal modes and the related frequencies , the mechanical proprieties are 517 calculated by applying linear elastic beam theory . 518 A linear elastic beam has constant stiffness when bending , k f , or stretching , k s . This constant 519 stiffness is related to the eigenvalue of the correspondent modes of motion as follows . 520 The bending modulus Y f is calculated as : 521 522 13 f f k Y I  ( S11 ) 523 524 Under the assumption of an isotropic and homogenous material , the bending modulus is equal to 525 the Young’s modulus . The stretching modulus Y x , i . e . the Young’s modulus , is calculated 526 directly by the stretching modes : 527 528 L A k Y s x  ( S12 ) 529 530 where k s is the extensional stiffness , A is the cross - sectional area of the filament ( ~ 19 . 6 nm 2 ) . 531 The persistence length l p , is related to the bending stiffness k f , the Boltzmann constant k B , and the 532 temperature T , through : 533 534 T k k l B f p  ( S13 ) 535 536 Using Rotation Translation Block approach to approximate NMA 537 The Rotation Translation Block ( RTB ) approach is an approximation of the NMA and 538 reproduces the lowest - frequency modes of motion of the system with reasonable accuracy at low 539 computational cost . This renders this approach particularly suitable when dealing with large 540 systems , as the actin filaments here considered , composed by about 20000 Cα . 541 Using the Rotation Translation Block ( RTB ) approach , the molecular system is divided in n b 542 rigid blocks , with each block made of a certain number of C α - atoms . For the actin filament , we 543 used the functional subdivision of each monomer subunit along the filament in four subdomains . 544 We consider each block as a rigid body , neglecting internal flexibilities within each actin 545 subdomain . Deformation of the whole actin filament are given by rotation - translation movements 546 of the rigid blocks ( Durand et al . 1994 ; Tama et al . 2000 ) . 547 With the rotation translation block approach , the full hessian matrix , H , is expressed in a basis , 548 H b , defined by rotations and translations of the n b rigid blocks : 549 550 HP P H T b  ( S14 ) 551 552 where P is an orthogonal 3 N x 6 n b matrix , built with the vector associated to the local 553 rotations / translations of each block . Approximate low - frequency normal modes are calculated by 554 diagonalizing H b , which is a reduced matrix of size 6 n b x 6 n b , instead of the entire original 555 matrix H of size 3 N x 3 N , where N is the number of C α - atoms in the system . 556 The corresponding atomic displacements of all C α - atoms of the system are given by : 557 558 b p PA A  ( S15 ) 559 560 where A b is the matrix of the eigenvectors of H b . 561 14 The eigenvectors can be expanded back to the atomic space using the transpose of the projector 562 P . 563 564 Brownian Dynamics simulations of a crosslinked actin filament network 565 In the network model , actin filaments are modeled as semiflexible polymers represented by a 566 series of cylindrical segments connected by elastic hinges , and actin crosslinking proteins 567 ( ACPs ) are modeled as a pair of cylindrical segments connected by elastic hinges ( Fig . 1g ) . 568 Harmonic potentials describe the extension and bending of both ACPs and actin filaments : 569 570   2 0 1 2 s s U k r r   ( S16 ) 571   2 0 1 2 b b U k     ( S17 ) 572 573 where k s is extensional stiffness , r is an instantaneous distance , r 0 is an equilibrium length , k b is 574 bending stiffness , θ is an instantaneous bending angle , and θ 0 is an equilibrium bending angle 575 ( r 0 , A = 140 nm , r 0 , ACP = 23 . 5 nm , θ 0 , A = 0 rad , θ 0 , ACP1 = 0 rad , θ 0 , ACP2 = π / 2 rad ) .

For the cylindrical geometry of the segments for actin filaments and ACPs , the effective 583 drag coefficient is defined as ( Clift et al . 2005 ) : 584 585 0 , , , 3 2 / 3 5 i c i i c i r r r     ( S19 ) 586 587 where r c , A = 7 nm and r c , ACP = 10 nm are diameter of the actin and ACP segments , respectively , 588 and μ = 0 . 086 Pa·s is the viscosity of surrounding medium .

In particular , the SD1 611 domains of opposite monomers ( monomers i and i + 1 ) were 5 . 85 % closer in ATP - F - actin and 612 6 . 54 % closer in ADP - F - actin ( Fig . 2c ) , showing that the opening of the nucleotide binding cleft 613 due to ATP hydrolysis did not prevent opposite subunits from coming closer together . 614 The average distance between SD4 and SD3 of adjacent subunits in opposite strands ( monomers 615 i and i + 1 ) increased 1 . 43 % in ATP - F - actin , while it did not change in ADP - F - actin . It is possible 616 that the opening of the cleft in ADP - F - actin causes steric hindrance that prevents the increase of 617 contact between these two subdomains . 618 Molecular rearrangements of the nucleotide resulted in slightly higher RMS fluctuations for ADP 619 than ATP . Considering all filaments but the ADP - Pi system , RMS fluctuations of ADP and ATP 620 were 1 . 586 ± 0 . 006 Å and 1 . 527 ± 0 . 006 Å , respectively , relative to the subunit configurations at 621 the onset of MD simulations . Cleavage of the γ - phosphate from ATP to create the ADP - Pi 622 intermediate form of the monomer subunit destabilized the nucleotide up to average RMS 623 fluctuations of 2 . 361 ± 0 . 967 Å , confirming that this is an intermediate form of the system . 624 Values of RMS fluctuations at equilibrium for selected regions of the monomer subunits in all 625 systems are reported in Supplementary Table 2 . 626 The DB loop ( residues 38 - 52 ) showed the highest fluctuations among the residues of the 627 monomer subunits . It was more mobile in ATP filaments ( with RMS fluctuations of 2 . 5 ± 0 . 063 628 Å ) than in ADP filaments ( with RMS fluctuations of 2 . 112±0 . 114 Å ) , reflecting its different 629 conformations ( disordered in ATP - bound monomers and helical in ADP - bound monomers ) . This 630 result is in agreement with the higher SD1 - SD2 distances found for the ATP systems with 631 respect to the ADP - bound systems ( Fig . 2e ) . The hydrophobic loop ( HL loop , including residues 632 262 - 274 ) to which the DB loop binds between adjacent intra - strand subunits did not show 633 discernible differences in terms of RMS fluctuations between the various systems , and presented 634 an average value of 1 . 58 ± 0 . 08 Å . In SD1 of all filaments , the C - terminus ( residues 370 - 375 ) 635 was slightly more mobile than the N - terminus ( residues 1 - 21 ) . 636 C - and N - termini did not show discernible differences in RMS fluctuations between the three 637 nucleotide systems . In the ATP - filaments , the RMS fluctuations of the C - and N - termini were 638 1 . 93 ± 0 . 09 Å and 1 . 52 ± 0 . 02 Å , respectively . In the ADP filaments the RMS fluctuations of the 639 C - and N - termini were 1 . 86 ± 0 . 04 Å and 1 . 62 ± 0 . 04 Å , respectively . In the ADP - Pi filament 640 form , the C - and N - termini had RMS fluctuations of 1 . 96 ± 0 . 04 Å and 1 . 58 ± 0 . 04 Å , 641 respectively . 642 For ADP - bound filaments , the increase of the mass center distances between SD2 and SD4 was 643 5 . 37 % and the increase in cleft size was 19 . 36 % ; for ATP - bound filaments , the increase of the 644 distance between the mass centers of SD2 and SD4 was 3 . 96 % and the increase in cleft size was 645 12 . 85 % . Our data agree with previous results documenting the opening of the nucleotide binding 646 cleft upon nucleotide hydrolysis , and also show that the increase of the space between the two 647 subdomains is due to both major repositioning of SD2 with respect to SD4 , and to an even 648 greater extent , rearrangements of internal residues between the two subdomains . These residues , 649 used to compute the cleft size , interact directly with the nucleotide . Furthermore , comparing 650 17 ADP - Pi - F - actin with the initial ADP - F - actin configuration , the average cleft was larger by 651 6 . 14 % and 16 . 19 % , in terms of distance between the mass centers of SD2 and SD4 and in terms 652 of cleft size , respectively . These results support that at equilibrium ATP filaments have a 653 narrower nucleotide cleft than ADP filaments . This result is in agreement with experimental 654 observation documenting that assembled actin monomers favor a closed cleft in the ATP and 655 ADP - Pi states , owing to the strong contact between the nucleotide ' s P β atom and the protein 656 backbone , and an open configuration in the ADP state , where the protein loses its contacts with 657 the phosphate .

The positions of the six crystallographic calcium binding sites , labeled 939 CA382 - CA387 , are shown as the red spheres . The position of the ADP nucleotide , near the high - 940 affinity calcium binding site CA382 , is denoted in licorice representation . ( b ) Ribbon 941 representation of the 13 - monomer repeat unit of F - actin used as input for MD simulation . Each 942 monomer subunit is shown in a different color . For clarity , the intra - crystalline water is not 943 shown . ( c ) Ribbon representation of the 13 - monomer F - actin within the solvated rectangular box 944 used for equilibrium MD . The filament is represented as “infinite” to account for PBC . ( d ) 945 Filament corresponding to the one in ( c ) , represented as “infinite” . ( e ) Schematics of the ENM 946 model of F - actin , where each Cα atom is replaced by a node . ( f ) RTB model of F - actin , with 947 rigid blocks corresponding to the four functional subdomains ( SD1 - 4 ) of actin , in order to 948 preserve the basic subunit topology at the filament level . ( g ) Coarse - graining scheme and 949 mechanics of the actin filaments and ACPs : actin filaments comprise a series of cylindrical 950 segments with barbed and pointed ends ; ACPs have two arms in parallel , rigidly bound to the 951 actin filament . Equilibrium lengths and angles are governed by various extensional ( k s ) and 952 bending ( k f ) rigidities . ( h ) A schematic view of the simulated shear strain test . A rigidly 953 crosslinked actin filament network is pinned at the – z boundary and a constant shear strain is 954 applied to the free + z boundary 955 956 Fig . 2 Inter - and intra - strand distances between mass centers of subdomains . 957 ( a ) An actin trimer is shown in coarse - grained ( CG ) and atomistic ( Ribbon ) representations . The 958 four subdomains labeled are : SD1 ( Blue ) residues 1 - 32 , 70 - 144 , 338 - 375 ; SD2 ( Red ) residues 959 33 - 69 ; SD3 ( Green ) residues 145 - 180 and 270 - 337 ; and SD4 ( Purple ) residues 181 - 269 . ( b ) F - 960 actin radius decreased in all systems during MD simulations , and in particular with saturation of 961 cation binding , for both ADP - and ATP - F - actins . Cross - strand interactions are reported in terms 962 of distances between the mass centers of SD1 / SD1 ( c ) , and SD4 / SD1 ( d ) . The distances between 963 SD4 / SD1 and SD1 / SD1 decrease within 12 ns of equilibrium MD simulations , leading to a 964 compaction of the subunit residues towards the F - actin longitudinal axis . In ADP - F - actin , 965 saturation of cation binding always lead to lesser variability in the distances between SD4 / SD1 966 and SD1 / SD1 ( reduced standard deviation from their average values ) . ( e ) Average and standard 967 deviation of the intra - strand distances between SD2 and SD1 pertaining to monomers ( i ) and 968 ( i + 2 ) , respectively , show that occupancy of both high - and low - affinity binding sites of the 969 subunits renders F - actin more homogeneous in the pairing of longitudinal subunits 970 971 Fig . 3 . Molecular rearrangements of monomer subunits related with variations in their 972 relative positioning . ( a ) Ribbon representation of the monomer subunit with spheres 973 representing the four functional subdomains , and the dihedral angle between the planes with 974 vertices in SD1 - SD2 - SD3 and SD1 - SD3 - SD4 , highlighted with a red arrow . ( b ) Average and 975 standard deviation of the dihedral angle , computed as the angle between the plane defined by the 976 mass centers of SD1 , SD2 and SD3 and the plane defined by the mass centers of SD1 , SD3 and 977 SD4 , show that saturation of cation binding lead to greater variability in the structure of F - actin . 978 ( c ) Root Mean Square ( RMS ) fluctuations of selected residue groups : the DB loop , including 979 residues 38 - 52 , is the most highly fluctuating group in the subunits ; the nucleotide has high 980 fluctuation in ADP - Pi . ( d ) Intra - monomer distances between SD2 and SD4 provide a mean to 981 33 evaluate relative repositioning of the two subunits upon nucleotide hydrolysis : this distance is 982 enhanced for ADP - F - actin and influences the cleft size . ( e ) The 3D distance between the centers 983 of mass of the protein backbone of residues 57 - 69 , 30 - 33 in SD2 and 203 - 216 in SD4 , residues 984 internal to the nucleotide cleft 985 986 Fig . 4 Persistence lengths and extensional rigidities of F - actins . ( a ) Persistence length shows 987 changes up to 10 % in ATP - F - actins and up to 6 % in ADP - F - actins , depending upon the presence 988 and the type of one or multiple cations at the high - , intermediate - and low - affinity binding sites 989 ( n = 10 simulations , error bar : standard error ) . ( b ) Changes observed in extensional rigidity of F - 990 actin mirrored those of persistence length , except that in the case of Ca 2 + saturation ATP - F - actin 991 was more rigid in bending than ADP - F - actin but less rigid in stretching than ADP - F - actin ( n = 10 992 simulations , error bar : standard error ) . ( c ) Normalized standard deviation of the root mean square 993 distance ( σ RMSD ) of the Cα of the monomer subunits from the average monomer structure . 994 995 Fig . 5 Strain - induced stiffening curves from the crosslinked actin network . ( a - b ) Strain - 996 stiffening response of the crosslinked actin network with 11 different nucleotide / cation bound 997 forms , including the intermediate ADP - Pi , with compliant and rigid ACPs , k s , ACP = 0 . 002 N / m and 998 0 . 2 N / m . ( c - d ) Strain - induced stiffening of the crosslinked actin filament network resulting from 999 altered mechanics of F - actin when Mg 2 + is bound at the “stiffness” site ( Kang et al . 2012 ) , with 1000 ks , ACP = 0 . 002 N / m and 0 . 2 N / m .
