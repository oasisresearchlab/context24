Despite the rapid increase in the number of biomolecules identified that undergo liquid - liquid phase separation ( LLPS ) , quantitative studies of the resulting condensates have been severely lagging behind . Here , we develop a micropipette - based technique , which uniquely allows quantifications of both the surface tension and viscosity of biomolecular condensates , independent of labeling and surface wetting effects . We demonstrate the accuracy and versatility of this technique by measuring condensates of LAF - 1 RGG domains and a polymer - based aqueous two - phase system ( ATPS ) . We anticipate this technique will be widely applicable to biomolecular condensates and will resolve several limitations regarding current approaches . Main Text Biomolecular condensates that arise from LLPS have recently emerged as a central player in numerous cellular processes 1 , 2 . Surface tension and viscosity are two independent parameters that define the material properties of a liquid 3 , 4 . Gradual increases in the viscosities of biomolecular condensates are often linked to the formation of fibrils that underlie aging - associated diseases 5 - 10 . Quantification of condensate rheology therefore holds promise for unravelling the mechanisms , as well as facilitating therapeutic advances in the treatment of these diseases 11 . While changes in condensate viscosity often have pathological consequences , the surface tension of biomolecular condensates can play key physiological roles : differences in surface tension can lead to layered multi - phase condensates , such as the compartmentation in nucleoli 12 - 14 . During autophagy , surface tension determines whether p62 condensates will be sequestered in small droplets or digested as a whole 15 . Finally , the nucleation of microtubule branches relies on an instability of TPX2 condensates , driven solely by the condensates’ surface tension 16 . Several techniques have been developed to probe either the viscosity or the surface tension of biomolecular condensates 12 , 17 - 21 . The most widely used measure of viscosity relies on fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) , which is challenging to quantify in the scenario of 3 - dimensional compartments such as biomolecular condensates 4 , 22 . Measurements of surface tension rely heavily on the fusion kinetics between two condenstates 17 . While significant improvements have been made 23 , 24 , the fusion assay is intrinsically limited because only a ratio of surface tension to viscosity can be estimated 12 . Therefore , a user - friendly technique that can directly measure both surface tension and viscosity of biomolecular condensates is still missing . Micropipette aspiration ( MPA ) has been well - established to study the elastic properties of cells and liposomes 25 , 26 . However , it has been challenging to apply MPA to quantify liquids . For MPA to perform well , the viscosity of the liquid needs to be large for the flow process to be adequately captured . At the same time , the surface tension of the liquid needs to be small for the aspiration pressure to overcome the capillary effect ( see Methods ) . Both requirements are in contradiction to the properties of common liquids , where low viscosity ( 10 - 3 ~ 10 - 2 Pa·s ) and high surface tension ( ~ 10 mN / m ) are often observed . However , currently available data suggest that biomolecular condensates exhibit high viscosity ( ~ 10 Pa·s ) and low surface tension ( 10 - 3 ~ 10 - 2 mN / m ) , making them uniquely poised for quantitative MPA studies ( Figure 1 ) . Here , we demonstrate the application of MPA to quantify the viscosity and surface tension of liquid condensates . We calibrated our method using a PEG - dextran ATPS 27 . This allowed us to develop a linear model to extract the material properties of condensates from their responses to MPA . We applied this technique to quantify condensates formed by the RGG domain , a well - known RNA binding region of the P granule RNA helicase LAF - 1 18 , 28 . We further confirmed our viscosity and surface tension measurements by FRAP and fusion assays , respectively . Our results suggest that material properties of protein condensates are closer to ATPS than to oil droplets in water . MPA represents an active microrheology technique that can simultaneously quantify independent properties of biomolecular condensates , insensitive to common sources of artifacts such as labeling , photobleaching , and wetting effects of proteins . Figure 1 . Viscosity and surface tension of liquids . Viscosity and surface tension of biomolecular condensates in aqueous buffer ( green , arrows represent changes of properties over time ) and common ‘oil droplets’ in water ( orange ) . The gray belt represents an estimated boundary above which MPA will be well - suited for viscosity and surface tension measurements ( Methods ) . The red and pink regions represent values for dextran - rich condensates measured in this study and estimated from literature 29 , 30 , respectively . See Table S1 for values and references used in this plot . To study the stress - strain relation of a liquid , a critical aspiration pressure 𝑃 𝛾 , determined by the surface tension ( γ ) of the condensate , needs to be reached . At aspiration pressures ( 𝑃 asp ) greater than 𝑃 𝛾 , the condensate will flow into the micropipette ( Figure 2a , we define suction pressures as positive ) . For a Newtonian fluid , the pressure difference and the flow rate are linearly related via the condensate’s viscosity ( η ) : 𝑃 asp = 𝑀 ∙ 𝜂 ∙ 𝑉 + 𝑃 𝛾 ( eq . 1 ) Here , 𝑉 = 𝑑 ( 𝐿 p / 𝑅 p ) / 𝑑𝑡 is the normalized flow rate . The critical pressure 𝑃 𝛾 = 2𝛾 ( 𝐻 − 1 / 𝑅 𝑐 ) . 𝐿 p , 𝑅 p , 𝑅 c , 𝐻 describe the shape of the aspirated condensate and are readily available through microscopy ( Figure 2a ) . However , the unitless factor M , which is a constant when ( R p / R c ) 3 < < 1 , must be determined experimentally by aspirating liquids of known viscosities 31 . Then , by measuring V under different P asp , the viscosity and surface tension of an unknown liquid condensate can be quantified from the slope and intercept , respectively , of eq . 1 . To calibrate ‘ M ’ with liquids that are appropriate for MPA ( Figure 1 ) , we chose an ATPS composed of PEG ( 8000 Da ) and dextran ( 500 , 000 Da ) 15 , 29 , 32 . Under a range of concentrations , mixtures of PEG and dextran will phase - separate into emulsions of micrometer - size droplets ( Figure S1a ) . Rhodamine - B was included to identify the condensates microscopically . This mixture produced a labeled emulsion that is stable on the timescale of MPA experiments ( ~ 10 min ) , but undergoes bulk phase separation after 1 ~ 2 hours ( Figure 2b ) . Stepwise aspiration pressures were applied to dextran - rich condensates , and the aspiration length was found to change linearly under each pressure step ( Figure 2c , Figure S1b ) . The resulting relation between the aspiration pressure and the condensate flow rate ( Figure 2d ) , agrees well with predictions of a Newtonian fluid . The slope d P asp / d V ( 37 . 0 ± 0 . 7 Pa·s ; n = 6 ; mean ± SEM for all values reported herein ) , therefore , represents the viscosity of the dextran - rich phase multiplied by ‘ M ’ ( eq . 1 ) . We then directly measured the viscosity by dragging an optically - trapped particle within the dextran - rich phase ( Figure 2e ) . The measured viscosity of the dextran - rich phase ( 74 ± 4 mPa·s ) agreed with bulk viscometer measurements ( Methods ) , giving M = 500 ± 30 . Additionally , the intercept from the P asp - V relation corresponds to a surface tension of 0 . 02 ± 0 . 01 mN / m ( eq . 1 ) , in agreement with the literature 29 . With careful control of water evaporation ( Figure S2 ) , next we applied MPA to protein samples of limited volumes ( 20 ~ 30 µL ) . Figure 2 .

LAF - 1 is one of the first well - studied proteins that undergo LLPS , mainly due to its intrinsically disordered N - terminal RGG domain 4 , 18 , 19 , 22 , 28 . We applied MPA to an engineered tandem RGG domain that robustly undergoes LLPS ( Methods ; hereafter named RGG condensates ) 28 . Unlike dextran , RGG condensates fully wet the inner wall of the micropipette , requiring a negative P γ to balance the capillary effect ( Figure 3a , H ≈ - 1 / R p ) . Beyond P γ , the aspiration length changed linearly under each pressure step ( Figure 3b , Movie S1 ) , indicating a lack of condensate elasticity at the timescale we were probing ( > 1 s ) . After initial - entry steps , V increased linearly with P asp ( Figure 3c , S3 , S4 ) . The slope corresponded to a viscosity of 1 . 62 ± 0 . 18 Pa·s ( n = 11 ) , in agreement with previous estimates 33 . As expected from the wetting behavior , the intercept of P asp vs . V was negative , and the corresponding surface tension was 0 . 159 ± 0 . 010 mN / m ( n = 11 ) . Many proteins tend to wet and adsorb onto solid surfaces 4 , 16 , 23 , 24 , 34 . While potentially mediating important biological processes 15 , 16 , 34 , this wetting effect can introduce significant artifacts in measurements that rely on the fusion kinetics or morphology of condensates 12 , 23 , 24 . In contrast , the contribution of R c in eq . 1 is negligible when R c - 1 < < | H | , making MPA insensitive to the wetting of condensates ( Figure 3c , Movie S2 ) . Additionally , fluorescent labeling of the protein is not necessary for MPA as long as the condensate - buffer interfaces can be resolved ( Figure S1c , S4 , and Movie S3 ) . For the same reasons , MPA measurements are insensitive to photobleaching and can be easily combined with fluorescence - based studies 24 , 35 , further expanding the applicability of this technique .

All scale bars , 10 µm . To confirm the surface tension and viscosity of RGG condensates measured by MPA , we first adopted an improved version of the condensate fusion assay 23 , 24 . Two optically - trapped RGG condensates were manipulated to encounter and the subsequent fusion process was recorded ( Figure 4a , 4b ) . A linear relation was observed between the fusion time and the size of the condensates ( Figure 4c ) . The slope , which scales with the inverse capillary velocity η / γ , was 0 . 016 ± 0 . 002 s / µm , in agreement with the MPA measurements ( η / γ = 0 . 010 ± 0 . 001 s / µm ) . We then used FRAP to estimate the viscosity of RGG condensates . A circular region within RGG condensates was photobleached , and diffusion coefficients were calculated based on the half - recovery time ( Figure 4d ) 22 . Combined with an estimate of the protein hydrodynamic radius , we obtained a viscosity of 1 . 8 Pa·s , comparable to the MPA result . We noticed that viscosity values between 0 . 8 and 3 . 6 Pa·s can be extracted from FRAP , depending on the extract model of choice ( Methods , Figure 4e ) . Figure 4 .

Estimates from FRAP and fusion kinetics are represented by the dished box ( Methods ) . All error bars are SEM , all scale bars are 10 µm . RGG condensates fuse quickly ( ~ 0 . 1 s ) with > 90 % of the constituting proteins moving freely , consistent with their liquid behavior during MPA . However , many biomolecular condensates can take more than 100 s to fuse 15 , 36 , while exhibiting small fractions ( < 50 % ) of mobile proteins 3 , 10 , 37 , 38 . In the latter cases , MPA measurements will be essential to clarify confusion around the condensates’ material properties 10 . The unambiguous quantification of RGG condensates through MPA further iterates the contrasting material properties of biomolecular condensates and oil droplets ( Figure 1 ) . For example , mineral oil has a surface tension 300 - fold higher than that of RGG condensates , whereas its viscosity is more than 200 - fold lower . Surface tension and viscosity are tunable through intermolecular interactions . Thus , a future direction will be to systematically dissect how protein sequence and biochemical environment affect the material properties of biomolecular condensates 4 . Importantly , by implementing a whole - cell patch - clamp configuration 39 , MPA can be applied to study biomolecular condensates in vivo . Finally , MPA setups are readily available in electrophysiology and biomechanics labs , making it easily adaptable for studying the material properties of biomolecular condensates in the broader biological and chemical communities .

At the same time , the surface tension needs to be small in order for the flow to start . Assume the maximal imaging frequency is 100 Hz ( Δt min = 0 . 01 s ) , the radius of the pipette : R p = 1 µm , and M = 500 ( see eq . 1 in the main text ) . In order to capture liquid deformations that are on the order of pipette diameter ( ΔL p = 2 µm ) , the viscosity η ( in Pa·s ) needs to satisfy : 𝜂 > | 𝑃 asp | ∙ 𝑅 p ∆𝑡 min 𝑀∆𝐿 p = 10 −5 | 𝑃 asp | ( S1 ) The aspiration pressure needs to overcome the capillary effect caused by the surface tension γ ( in mN / m ) . For a non - wetting ( H - 1 = R p ) or a perfectly wetting ( H - 1 = - R p ) liquid with R c > > R p : | 𝑃 asp | > 2𝛾 𝑅 p = 2 × 10 3 𝛾 ( S2 ) Combine relations S1 and S2 : 𝜂 ( in Pa ∙ s ) > 2 × 10 −2 𝛾 ( in mN / m ) ( S3 ) Therefore , relation S3 defines the regime of viscosity and surface tension where MPA is expected to perform well . In Figure 1 , η = 0 . 02 γ is plotted as the black dashed line , gray regions represent η = 0 . 01 γ ~ 0 . 04 γ . Protein purification and sample preparation RGG - based proteins were expressed recombinantly in E . coli and purified by affinity chromatography , as previously described 1 . The working protein sample contains 1 μM RGG - EGFP - RGG ( molecular mass 62 . 1 kDa ) and 6 μM RGG - RGG ( molecular mass 35 . 7 kDa ) in a pH 7 . 5 buffer containing 20 mM Tris and 150 mM NaCl . Phase separated dextran and PEG aqueous two - phase systems were prepared by mixing different concentrations of PEG - 8000 ( 43443 - 22 , Alfa Aesar , US ) and dextran - 500k ( DE132 - 100GM , Spectrum Chemical , US ) stock solutions . The stock solutions were prepared by dissolving each polymer in Milli - Q water . Emulsions of different PEG to dextran ratios showed different distributions of droplet size ( Figure S1a ) . The 5 % PEG and 6 . 4 % dextran ( both by mass ) mixture was chosen for micropipette aspiration , because the resulting emulsion contained droplets with comparable sizes to those of the protein condensates . Rhodamine - B ( 83689 - 1G , Sigma , USA ) was added ( at a final concentration of 1 μM ) to the PEG - dextran mixture to distinguish the dextran phase from the PEG phase ( Figure 2b ) . Rhodamine - B preferentially enters the PEG - rich phase 2 , therefore dextran - rich condensates showed as dark droplets in a bright background in fluorescent microscopy images ( Figure 2b , upper right image ) . The fluorescent labeling was confirmed by the observation that after bulk LLPS , the heavier dextran - rich layer ( Figure 2b , lower layer of the lower left image ) contained less Rhodamine - B compared to the lighter PEG - rich layer . The concentration of dextran in the dextran - rich layer was estimated to be ~ 14 % by mass . Micropipette fabrication , aspiration , and imaging Micropipettes were pulled from glass capillaries using a pipette puller ( PUL - 1000 , World Precision Instruments ( WPI ) , US ) . The tip of the pipette was cut to an opening diameter between 1 ~ 5 μm and bent to ∼ 40° using a microforge ( DMF1000 , WPI ) . Micropipette aspiration and imaging were carried out on a Ti2 - A inverted fluorescent microscope ( Nikon , Japan ) equipped with a motorized stage and two motorized 4 - axes micromanipulators ( PatchPro - 5000 , Scientifica , UK ) . A micropipette was filled with the same buffer as the protein ( 20 mM Tris and 150 mM NaCl , pH 7 . 5 ) using a MICROFIL needle ( WPI ) and subsequently mounted onto a micromanipulator . The rear end of the pipette was connected to an adjustable water reservoir . The pipette holder was then rotated so that the bent tip of the micropipette was parallel to the imaging plane . The aspiration pressure within the micropipette was controlled and recorded by adjusting the water level in the reservoir using a set of 5 ml , 20 ml , 50 ml , and 150 ml syringes connected to the reservoir . The zero pressure of the system was calibrated before each MPA experiment , using a dilute solution of fluorescent nanoparticles . The zero pressure ( P 0 ) was set according to the point where fluorescent nanoparticles underwent Brownian motion inside the micropipette . The error in aspiration pressure ( < 2 Pa ) was defined as the minimal pressure change near P 0 that resulted in an observable directed flow of fluorescent particles in the micropipette . MPA experiments were carried out in glass - bottom dishes ( ES56291 , Azer Scientific , US ) that were pre - treated with 5 % Pluronic F127 ( P2443 - 250G , Sigma ) for > 1 hour to prevent adhesion of RGG condensates to the glass 1 . Milli - Q water was added to the edge of the dish to minimize evaporation from the sample ( Figure 2a ) . We further quantified water evaporation rates under our experimental conditions using a 20 µL sample of Rhodamine - B solution ( Figure S2 ) . Volume of the sample was assumed to be inversely proportional to its mean fluorescence intensity . No measurable volume change was observed when the dish - cap was on , providing a stable environment for necessary incubation periods for the sample . When the dish - cap was removed for micropipette aspiration , evaporation led to a slow constant decrease in the sample volume ( ~ 0 . 04 µL / min ) . We found that the evaporation can be compensated to be less than 5 % in our MPA experiments ( Figure S2 ) . After calibration of the aspiration pressure , a 20 ~ 30 μL sample of phase separated protein solution was added to the center of the dish ( Figure 2a ) . Once micrometer - size protein condensates were observed at the bottom of the dish , a calibrated micropipette was moved to a condensate of interest to start the aspiration measurements . First , a positive ( suction ) pressure was applied to initiate the flow of the condensate into the micropipette . The condensate was typically allowed to flow into the micropipette until the aspiration length reached ~ 40 μm ( the maximal aspiration length was limited by the field of view of the camera , initial condensate size , and the exact angle of the micropipette tip ) . Then , sequential stepwise ejection and suction pressures were applied to deform the condensate at different shear stresses while maintaining the aspiration length to be between 5 to 40 μm ( Figure 3b and S3a - b ) . The deformation of the condensate was recorded using a 60X objective , at 1 Hz ( ORCA - Flash 4 . 0 , Hamamatsu , Japan ) , either through transmitted light imaging ( Figure S1 , S4 , Movie S3 ) or through imaging the fluorescence of the EGFP tag ( Figure 3 , S3 , Movies S1 , S2 ) . Of note , larger condensates typically result in more accurate MPA measurements , mainly due to the smaller perturbation of the changing aspiration length to R c . For a > 10 μm condensate , typical changes in aspiration length correspond to a < 3 % change in R c . Therefore , in our experiments , small condensates were first manipulated into a large condensate through either a micropipette or an optical trap ( see “Optical trap mediated condensate fusion” section ) before MPA measurements . When the RGG condensate first entered the micropipette , wetting between protein and glass led to dramatic changes in the interfacial curvature between the condensate and buffer inside the micropipette . The interfacial curvature stabilized in later steps ( Figure S3a , Movie S1 ) . As a result , the P asp vs . V relation during the initial - entry largely deviated from that of the remaining steps ( Figure S3b , S3c ) . We corrected for the change in H by subtracting a time - dependent P γ from the aspiration pressure ( Figure S3d ) . However , the irreversible binding of a trace amount of protein to the inner wall of the aspiration pipette significantly accelerated the deformation of condensates during the initial - entry steps ( Figure S3e , S3f ) . To account for the lack of information about the kinetics of protein - glass binding , we disregarded the measurements from the initial - entry steps . After the initial steps , the interfacial curvature between RGG condensates and buffer in the micropipette was set by the wetting of the protein to the inner pipette wall ( Movie S1 ) . Due to this wetting effect , RGG condensates flowed into the micropipette under both positive ( suction ) and small negative ( ejection ) pressures , whereas decreases in aspiration length only happened under large negative ( ejection ) pressures ( Figure 3 , Movie S1 , Figure S4 ) . Adhesion between RGG condensates and the glass bottom dish can be prevented by coating the glass with 5 % Pluronic F127 1 . However , we noticed that the same coating procedure does not necessarily work for other protein condensates or glass surfaces . To expand the applicability of MPA , we compared the measurements on near - free condensates that sedimented to the bottom of coated dishes ( Figure 3a ) with condensates that are purposefully adhered to a bare glass pipette ( Figure 3c ) . MPA gave near identical P asp vs . V relations for the two types of RGG condensates ( Figure 3c ) , even though R c was not accurately defined in the strongly - adhered condensates . This agrees with expectations from eq . 1 , where the contribution of R c can be neglected when | R c - 1 | < < H , as is in our experiments . Viscosity of dextran - rich condensates To calibrate the viscosity measurements , MPA should be applied to condensates with viscosity values that can be easily determined through other means . Dextran - rich condensates in a PEG - dextran aqueous two - phase system were chosen for this purpose ( Figure 2 ) . After MPA , two independent methods were used to measure the viscosity of the dextran - rich phase . 1 . Optical dragging An optical trap ( Tweez305 , Aresis , Slovenia ) was applied to drag an r = 1 . 60 µm radius polystyrene bead ( HUP - 30 - 5 , Spherotech , US ) in a large dextran - rich condensate at 13 different velocities ( Figure 2e ) . The slope of the dragging force ( f ) vs . dragging speed ( v ) was used to calculate the viscosity ( η ) based on the Stokes equation ( eq . S4 ) : 𝑑𝑓 𝑑𝑣 = 𝜂 ∙ 6𝜋𝑟 ( S4 ) The measured viscosity was 74 ± 4 mPa·s . The stiffness of the optical trap ( ~ 0 . 02 pN / nm ) was calibrated before each experiment by applying equipartition theorem to the thermal fluctuation of a trapped bead in the dextran - rich phase 3 . 2 . Ubbelohde viscometer After the bulk - phase separation of 40 ml PEG - dextran mixture , the bottom layer , corresponding to the dextran - rich phase , was applied through an Ubbelohde viscometer ( 13 - 614C , Cannon Instrument , US ) . The viscosity was measured to be 80 mPa·s . Optical trap mediated condensate fusion Two RGG condensates were individually controlled by two independent optical traps ( Tweez305 , Aresis , Slovenia ) equipped on the Ti2 - A inverted microscope ( Nikon , Japan ) . As illustrated in Figure 4a , the right condensate was moved towards the left one until they touched . Then , the right optical trap was turned off , and the condensates were allowed to fuse under the combined influence of their viscosity and surface tension . The fusion processes were acquired at a frame rate of 20 Hz using a 60x water objective . The acquired images were analyzed in MATLAB ( R2019a ) . The images were fitted into a Gaussian ellipse and the ratio of the major to minor axes of the ellipse ( aspect ratio ) was plotted as a function of time . The fusion time ( 𝜏 ) was extracted by fitting the change in the aspect ratio ( AR ) of fusing condensates to a single exponential decay ( Figure 4b , eq . S5 ) . 𝐴𝑅 = 1 + ( 𝐴𝑅 0 − 1 ) e −𝑡 𝜏⁄ ( S5 ) The length of condensates was defined as the geometric mean of the condensate diameters before fusion 4 . The ratio of viscosity to surface tension ( inverse capillary velocity ) was estimated from the slope of the fusion time vs . length relation ( Figure 4c ) . FRAP measurement of the condensate viscosity FRAP experiments were performed on a total internal reflection fluorescence microscope ( DMi8 TIRF , Leica , Germany ) equipped with an Infinity Scanner system ( Leica , Germany ) . All images were acquired using a 100X oil objective at 1 Hz . A 1 . 5 μm radius circular region was photobleached at the center of large RGG condensates ( radius 9 ± 2 µm ) using a short pulse ( ~ 1 s ) of focused 488 nm laser , and the fluorescence recovery was analyzed using ImageJ . After background subtraction , fluorescence of the bleached region ( I ROI ) was divided by the fluorescence of the entire condensate ( I cond ) according to eq . S6 , to minimize photobleaching and boundary effects 5 , 6 . 𝐼 ( 𝑡 ) = 𝐼 𝑅𝑂𝐼 ( 𝑡 ) −𝐼 𝑏𝑎𝑐𝑘𝑔𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑑 ( 𝑡 ) 𝐼 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑑 ( 𝑡 ) −𝐼 𝑏𝑎𝑐𝑘𝑔𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑑 ( 𝑡 ) ( S6 ) The time point right after the bleaching step was defined as time zero . I ( t ) was normalized so that the average of I ( t < 0 ) equals to 1 . To extract the half - recovery time , I ( t ) was fitted to eq . S7a or eq . S7b , depending on whether an immobile fraction was included in the model . 𝐼 ( 𝑡 ) = 𝐼 0 + 𝐼 ∞ 𝑡 𝜏1 / 2 1 + 𝑡 𝜏1 / 2 ( S7a ) 𝐼 ( 𝑡 ) = 𝐼 0 + 𝑡 𝜏1 / 2 1 + 𝑡 𝜏1 / 2 ( S7b ) Here , 𝜏 1 / 2 is the half - recovery time and 𝐼 ∞ is the mobile fraction ( in eq . S7b , 𝐼 ∞ is set to 1 ) . See Figure 4d for the fitting results . The diffusion coefficient ( D ) of the bleached molecule ( RGG - EGFP - RGG ) can be determined from a 2D or a 3D infinity model , according to eq . S8a or S8b , respectively 5 . 𝐷 = 0 . 22⋅𝑟 𝑅𝑂𝐼2 𝜏 1 / 2 ( S8a ) 𝐷 = 0 . 1⋅𝑟 𝑅𝑂𝐼2 𝜏 1 / 2 ( S8b ) Where r ROI = 1 . 5 μm is the radius of the bleached area , 𝜏 1 / 2 is the recovery time from eq . S7 . The viscosity of RGG condensates was then calculated using the Stokes - Einstein relation ( eq . S9 ) 7 . 𝜂 = 𝑘 𝐵 𝑇 6𝜋𝑅 𝐻 𝐷 ( S9 ) R H is the hydrodynamic radius of RGG - EGFP - RGG . Using the online Hydrodynamic Radius Converter ( https : / / www . fluidic . com / resources / Toolkit / hydrodynamic - radius - Converter / ) , R H was estimated to be 6 . 54 nm , by taking into consideration the molecular mass and folding of RGG - GFP - RGG 8 . In Figure 4e , the horizontal red dashed line ( η = 0 . 8 Pa·s ) represents viscosity calculated assuming the presence of immobile proteins ( eq . S7a ) in the 2D model ( eq . S8a ) . The vertical red dashed line represents surface tension calculated using η = 0 . 8 Pa·s and the higher bound of inverse capillary velocity ( η / γ = 0 . 018 s / µm ) measured from the fusion assay ( Figure 4c ) . The horizontal blue dashed line ( η = 3 . 6 Pa·s ) represents viscosity calculated assuming the absence of immobile fraction ( eq . S7b ) in the 3D model ( eq . S8b ) . The vertical blue dashed line represents surface tension calculated using η = 3 . 6 Pa·s and the lower bound of inverse capillary velocity ( η / γ = 0 . 014 s / µm ) measured from the fusion assay ( Figure 4c ) .

All scale bars , 20 µm . Figure S2 : Quantification and correction of water evaporation during micropipette aspiration experiments . Under our experimental conditions , the presence of peripheral water eliminated evaporation from the 20 µL sample as long as the cap of sample dish was on . Upon removing the cap ( red arrow ) for micropipette aspiration , water slowly evaporated at a rate of 0 . 04 µL / min . The evaporation during micropipette aspiration was compensated ( blue arrow ) through continuous injection of pure water using a second micropipette , or by adding 2 µL of pure water every 50 min . Sample volume was measured through fluorescence - based concentration measurement of Rhodamine - B at an imaging rate of 1 frame per minute and no measurable photobleaching was observed . Figure S3 : The interfacial curvature and the wetting of RGG condensate inside micropipette . a , Time lapse fluorescence images showing the aspirated portion of the condensate . After proteins enter the micropipette ( 1 - 4 s ) , the wetting of proteins to the inner pipette wall led to swift changes in the interfacial curvature of the protein condensate .
