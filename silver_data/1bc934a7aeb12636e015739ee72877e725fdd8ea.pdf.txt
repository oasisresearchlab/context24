Learning based on storytelling is an effective approach to enhancing children ' s knowledge and correct behaviors , especially when it is conveyed by engaging novel technologies . Among these technologies , social robots have a special appeal for educational purposes . The paper presents a pilot project in which the social robot Pepper is used as an educational storyteller in the context of nutrition . To investigate the appropriateness of the approach , a preliminary study was performed to comparethe effects of Pepper vs a human storyteller . Results are interesting in terms of engagement , user experience , trust , and learning of relevant concepts , suggesting that the proposed approach can be effective in this domain . Keywords—social robot , storytelling , education I . I NTRODUCTION Childhood obesity is a growing problem worldwide . More than 35 million children under the age of 5 and about 340 million children and adolescents aged 5 - 19 are overweight or obese and this is a major risk factor for noncommunicable diseases such as cardiovascular diseases , musculoskeletal disorders , and cancers [ 1 ] . Its psychological correlates ( unsatisfactory body image , depressive and anxious symptoms , eating disorders , low self - esteem ) and social stigmatization are frequently reported ( bullying , weight bias , fat shaming ) [ 2 ] . The research project aims at investigating the effect of social robotics as an educational technology in this context . Social robots are physically embodied , autonomous agents that communicate and interact with humans on a social and emotional level . They have great potential in engaging children in educational tasks since , through dialogues , narrative , and game - based approaches , they may create a positive user experience [ 3 , 4 ] . Many research works underline the success of robots as educational tools showing to increase cognitive and affective outcomes [ 5 , 6 ] . Social robots are also increasingly proving to be effective as behavior change agents on dietary intake [ 7 ] . Results are providing preliminary evidence on the implementation feasibility and potential of the social robot - based platform toward the improvement of children’s health behaviors in the context of childhood obesity prevention [ 8 , 9 , 10 ] . According to these findings , an interactive storytelling application with the main aim of supporting nutrition education and self - awareness was developed . The digital intervention was developed using Pepper as a storyteller presenting the nutrition pyramid together with two stories concerning the Mediterranean diet . The stories were implemented through Pepper ' s verbal and non - verbal communication behaviors . As a first step to measure the effectiveness of the proposed approach in this domain , an exploratory study was designed in which Pepper and a human storyteller were compared in terms of engagement , user experience , trust , and level of acquisition of new concepts . Results show that the overall experience and trust between the two storytellers are good and similar , even if the robot scored a bit higher in terms of engagement . The level of knowledge acquisition in the group that interacted with the robot during storytelling is slightly lower but still very high . These preliminary results gave us useful information to improve the storytelling application and perform a more complete study in the future . II . T HE H EALTHY P EPPER A . The Context According to the recommendations to prevent childhood obesity [ 11 ] , it is important to highlight healthy school environments and food literacy within schools’ core curriculum . Then , teaching the rules of proper nutrition through game - based learning and engagement in food literacy is expected to increase children’s self - awareness and decision - making ability and promote healthy , varied , and balanced dietary habits [ 12 ] . Having a proper diet from an early age means growing up healthy , so promoting the acquisition of information about healthy and unhealthy foods is important for children ' s growth and empowerment . B . The Stories Besides illustrating the nutrition pyramid adapted for children with the explanation of all the nutrient categories , we selected two stories from a book expressly created to teach some aspects of correct nutrition to children : - Raw the courageous chick : this story is focused on the importance of eating whole foods which are many times avoided just for their color and aspect . The main character of the story is “Raw” , a brown chick of rice , that is discriminated against for its aspect . The story aims at encouraging children to try foods 121 2023 IEEE International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies ( ICALT ) 2161 - 377X / 23 / $ 31 . 00 ©2023 IEEE DOI 10 . 1109 / ICALT58122 . 2023 . 00041 2023 I EEE I n t e r n a t i o n a l C o n f e r e n c e o n A d v a n c e d L e a r n i n g T e c hn o l o g i e s ( I C A L T ) | 979 - 8 - 3503 - 0054 - 3 / 23 / $ 31 . 00 © 2023 I EEE | D O I : 10 . 110 9 / I C A L T 58122 . 2023 . 00041 Authorized licensed use limited to the terms of the applicable license agreement with IEEE .

Besides explaining the importance of eating vegetables and the benefits of broccoli in particular , the story plays with the characters to justify the smell of broccoli , which is often the main reason against eating it . C . Pepper Storyteller The storytelling application employs Pepper Robot , a semi - humanoid robot developed by Aldebaran Robotics [ 13 ] . Pepper has a tablet on the torso that can be used effectively to synchronize what the robot says with images , which is useful in storytelling applications . When the interaction starts , Pepper explains the purpose of the interactive experience , then it shows on its tablet the main screen of the application on which the user can select the nutrition pyramid , where the main nutrients are presented , or the stories described previously ( Fig . 1 ) . After the storytelling session , Pepper makes some questions to each child about nutrition concepts and elements mentioned in the story . ( a ) ( b ) ( c ) ( d ) Figure 1 . Some moments of the storytelling with the Healthy Pepper , namely the selection between the nutrition pyramid and the stories ( a ) , the nutrition pyramid ( b ) , a moment of the story of Raw , the courageous chick ( c ) , and a group of children while listening to the story ( d ) . The user , again , may reply with vocal input or select the answer on the tablet . In case of a correct answer Pepper will enforce the concept by giving useful tips . In case of a wrong answer , Pepper will give the correct answer and explain why it is not correct . Also , in this case , Pepper will supply useful tips . III . T HE E XPLORATORY S TUDY To test whether the designed storytelling experience was engaging and effective , we compared two types of storytellers : Pepper ( R ) vs a human teacher ( H ) . To this aim , a between - subjects design was used in the pilot test . Several measures were collected to assess user engagement , enjoyment , and experience , as well as to assess trust and knowledge acquisition . D . Material Two questionnaires defined by the authors were used to collect data . The pre - test was composed of 10 questions , and it was filled in before the activity . It was aimed at collecting : users’ demographic data , confidence in playing with robots and with stories , and previous knowledge about correct nutrition and food nutrients . The post - test was composed of 9 questions , and it was aimed at measuring the children’s experience , engagement , and trust in what the storyteller was narrating ( see Table I ) . In both questionnaires , children can express a score between 1 ( very low ) to 4 ( very high ) . T ABLE I .

In addition , we measured the learning of some concepts mentioned in the stories for testing how effective Pepper was in conveying educational concepts compared to the Human storyteller . For this task , the child had to answer whether the statement was true or false ( Table II ) . E . Participants and Procedure This exploratory study involved 14 children , ( balanced for gender ) , aged from 8 to 9 y . o . attending the third grade of primary school . Children were divided into two groups : the first group ( R ) used the Pepper Storyteller , and the second group ( H ) did the same activity with the human teacher . In the H condition , the teacher projected on the wall the same images that in the R condition were shown on Pepper’s tablet . Before the activity , all children participating in the study underwent the 122 Authorized licensed use limited to the terms of the applicable license agreement with IEEE . Restrictions apply . pre - test and their parents authorized their participation by signing a written consent . Then the activities , in the two modalities , were carried out at the same time in two different rooms . After the storytelling session , the participants were asked to evaluate their experience with the storyteller by answering the post - test questionnaire ( Table I ) and some questions to measure their learning ( in the R condition using Pepper’s tablet , in the H condition using a paper questionnaire ) . F . Results The pre - test showed that all the children had a similar background . They were aware of the importance of eating well , although they could not always put it into practice . They had never experienced interacting with a social robot and were accustomed to listening to stories . The results of the post - test questionnaire are summarized in Fig . 2 and showed that the interaction with the robot received an overall good rating in terms of user experience and engagement . An interesting result is the one related to the engagement and enjoyment that was higher in the R condition , maybe due also to the novelty aspects related to the use of the robot [ 12 ] , then it would be interesting to understand if these effects remain in the long - term interaction . It was interesting to notice that all the children involved in the study trusted what the robot was telling them as well as for the H condition . The knowledge acquisition was also good in the R condition compared to the H one showing that Pepper can be successful in this task . III . C ONCLUSIONS AND F UTURE W ORK Our long - term transdisciplinary research goal is to develop a robot - based educational intervention in domains of nutrition , wellbeing , and health , to help children to improve their attitudes , habits and promote awareness [ 14 ] . The described project focuses on childhood obesity prevention in the context of school - based nutrition education with the aim of building engaging and collaborative learning environments where children can participate and interact within a constructivist perspective of learning . As a preliminary investigation , a pilot study was performed with a small sample to investigate if some differences occur between the two approaches ( H vs R ) . Results suggest that the children appreciate both approaches , but the robot was perceived as more engaging and enjoyable . On the other hand , the impact on involvement and fun is higher with the robot because it is a new and very exciting experience for children . For what concerns the learning dimension results are comparable . A further experiment is ongoing with a larger sample to explore in depth these results . The idea is to collect , besides the results based on questionnaires , also some behavioral measures like eye contact and emotions to measure the level of engagement and enjoyment during the interaction .
