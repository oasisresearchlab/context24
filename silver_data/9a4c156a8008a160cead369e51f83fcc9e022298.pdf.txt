Oxford . Voltage - dependent ion chan - nels in CAD cells : a catecholaminergic neuronal line that exhibits inducible differentiation . J Neurophysiol 84 : 2888 – 2895 , 2000 . Cell lines derived from tumors engineered in the CNS offer promise as models of speciﬁc neuronal cell types . CAD cells are an unusual subclone of a murine cell line derived from tyrosine hydroxylase ( TH ) driven tumorigenesis , which undergoes reversible morphological dif - ferentiation on serum deprivation . Using single - cell electrophysiology we have examined the properties of ion channels expressed in CAD cells . Despite relatively low resting potentials , CAD cells can be induced to ﬁre robust action potentials when mildly artiﬁcially hyper - polarized . Correspondingly , voltage - dependent sodium and potassium currents were elicited under voltage clamp . Sodium currents are TTX sensitive and exhibit conventional activation and inactivation proper - ties . The potassium currents reﬂected two pharmacologically distin - guishable populations of delayed rectiﬁer type channels while no transient A - type channels were observed . Using barium as a charge carrier , we observed an inactivating current that was completely blocked by nimodipine and thus associated with L - type calcium channels . On differentiation , three changes in functional channel expression occurred ; a 4 - fold decrease in sodium current density , a 1 . 5 - fold increase in potassium current density , and the induction of a small noninactivating barium current component . The neuronal mor - phology , excitability properties , and changes in channel function with differentiation make CAD cells an attractive model for study of catecholaminergic neurons . I N T R O D U C T I O N Cultured cell lines of purely neuronal origin are of immense value in biochemical and molecular studies of neuron function . They are potentially superior to primary neuronal cultures as the latter are usually restricted in numbers , mixed with other types of cells and often fragile in culture . Furthermore , it is generally difﬁcult to maintain primary neurons derived from adult animals for long periods of time . Thus the establishment of immortalized neuronal cell lines , especially those with spe - ciﬁc differentiated neuronal phenotypes is desirable . So far , several cell lines have been generated for this purpose , such as PC12 cells ( Greene and Tischler 1976 ) , P19 cells ( Jones - Villeneuve et al . 1982 ) , MN9D cells ( Choi et al . 1991 ) , and MES23 . 5 cells ( Crawford et al . 1992 ) , but none of these lines derive purely from the CNS nor exhibit completely differenti - ated neuronal characteristics . Through the use of oncogenes driven by cell - speciﬁc pro - moters that direct tumorigenesis of target deﬁned neurons in transgenic mice , a new catecholaminergic cell line called CATH . a has been developed ( Suri et al . 1993 ) . This line was derived from tyrosine hydroxylase ( TH ) – positive tumors in - duced in transgenic mice carrying the Simian Virus ( SV40 ) large T antigen oncogene under the transcriptional control of 5 9 ﬂanking sequences from the rat TH gene . Tumors derived in this manner are restricted to neuronal populations normally expressing the TH gene , the transcriptional regulation of which is co - opted to trigger neoplastic growth . CATH . a cells synthe - size dopamine and norepinephrine and express the catechol - amine synthetic enzymes , TH and dopamine b - hydroxylase . In addition , these cells exhibit neuronal speciﬁc molecules such as neuroﬁlaments and synaptophysin ( Suri et al . 1993 ) and express voltage - dependent ion channels including tetrodotoxin ( TTX ) - sensitive sodium channels , L - and N - type calcium channels and potassium channels ( Lazaroff et al . 1996 ) . Al - though CATH . a cells express a variety of pan - neuronal mark - ers , these cells do not bear neurites , nor apparently can they be induced to morphologically differentiate ( Qi et al . 1997 ) . CAD cells are a novel subclone recently derived from CATH . a cells by single cell cloning of spontaneous variants that exhibited short processes not normally seen in the parental line ( Qi et al . 1997 ) . In contrast to their parental CATH . a cells , CAD cells can undergo a reversible differentiation . When cultured in serum containing medium , CAD cells have an undifferentiated phenotype ( Fig . 1 A ) and proliferate . Remark - ably on serum deprivation , CAD cells develop a differentiated neuronal - like phenotype ( Fig . 1 B ) and stop proliferation ( Qi et al . 1997 ) . The undifferentiated phenotype is characterized by round or oval - shaped cells with few if any processes , while the differentiated phenotype exhibits a spindle - like shape with long processes morphologically identical to those of many primary CNS neurons . Ultrastructurally , processes from differ - entiated CAD cells have abundant parallel microtubules and intermediate ﬁlaments , and bear varicosities that contain both large dense - core vesicles and smaller clear vesicles ( Qi et al . 1997 ) . Interestingly , the SV40 T antigen has been spontane - ously lost in CAD cells , while neuron - speciﬁc proteins , such as class III b - tubulin , GAP - 43 , and SNAP - 25 , and synaptotag - min , but not the astrocytic marker GFAP are expressed in CAD Address for reprint requests : G .

In addition , CAD cells express enzymatically active TH and accumulate L - DOPA ( Qi et al . 1997 ) . To determine whether CAD cells have the excitability prop - erties expected for neuronal membranes , we characterized volt - age - dependent currents using whole cell recording methods . Furthermore , the reversible differentiation of CAD cells af - fords the opportunity to examine the regulation of excitability during differentiation in this cell line . Differentiation of normal neuron precursors ( Spitzer and Ribera 1998 ) and other tumor - derived cell lines ( e . g . , Toselli et al . 1996 ) results in changes in channel expression and function . The parent CATH . a cell line has previously been shown to express several different voltage - dependent channels ( Lazaroff et al . 1996 ) ; however , the inabil - ity of that line to exhibit neuronal morphology prompts the comparison of channel expression in differentiated versus un - differentiated CAD cells . A preliminary report of some of these ﬁndings has appeared in abstract form ( Smith et al . 1997 ) . M E T H O D S Cell culture CAD cells were grown at 37°C and in 5 % CO 2 on 25 cm 2 tissue culture ﬂasks ( Sarstedt , Newton , NC ) in Ham’s F12 / EMEM medium ( GIBCO , Grand Island , NY ) , supplemented with 8 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ; Sigma , St . Louis , MO ) and 1 % penicillin / streptomycin ( 100 % stocks , 10 , 000U / ml penicillin G sodium and 10 , 000 m g / ml streptomycin sulfate ) . Cells were passaged every 6 – 7 days at a 1 : 20 dilution . To induce morphological differentiation , cells were switched to the same medium without serum supplementation after 12 – 24 h . For electrophysiological characterization , cells are plated onto poly - lysine – coated plastic coverslips ( Fisher , Pittsburgh , PA ) and visual - ized under Hoffman optics during experiments . Electrophysiological techniques Standard whole cell patch - clamp methods were employed to record the resting potential , action potentials , and voltage - dependent currents from individual CAD cells . The resting potential and action potentials were studied under current clamp , and action potentials were usually expressed during tonic hyperpolarization of the cell by injection of 2 5 to 2 10 pA currents . Whole cell current responses were routinely elicited under voltage clamp by depolarizing step voltage commands ( 2 80 to 1 60 mV ) or repetitive voltage commands to 1 40 mV . The holding potential in most experiments was 2 60 mV , with the excep - tion of measurements of Ca 2 1 channel activity where the holding potential was 2 80 mV and a - P / 4 divided pulse protocol was em - ployed to eliminate the passive membrane properties . To examine A - type potassium currents , a family of inactivation prepulses from 2 100 to 1 10 mV ( 280 ms ) followed by repetitive steps from holding to 1 10 mV was used . Signals were recorded with an Axopatch 1B or 200 ampliﬁer ( Axon Instruments , Foster City , CA ) and ﬁltered at 5 kHz . Patch electrodes are pulled from cleaned Drummond N51A glass ( Drummond Scientiﬁc , Broomall , PA ) on a PP - 83 ( Narashige , Tokyo ) puller . Dental wax ( Kerr Sticky wax , Romulus , MI ) was used to coat the electrodes to minimize the capacitive properties . Electrodes were ﬁre polished with a homemade microforge to a ﬁnal electrode resis - tance of 0 . 5 – 6 M V . Electrode tips were ﬁlled by dipping into a relatively simple chloride salt solution of the major cation for an experiment ( e . g . , KCl , HEPES , MgCl 2 ) and then backﬁlled with the desired patch solution ( see Recording solutions and drugs ) . The experimental chamber containing cells was viewed with a Nikon Diaphot inverted microscope ( Nikon , Japan ) at 3 400 under Hoffman optics and was continuously superfused at ; 1 ml / min with external solutions . We routinely achieved gigaseals of 1 to ; 10 G V on CAD cells . All experiments were performed at room temperature ( 21 – 23°C ) . The access resistance values typically ranged from 2 to 7 M V . The current responses were normalized by the cell capacitance ( pA / pF ) to account for variation in cell size and geometry . FIG . 1 . Interference contrast images of CAD cells maintained in serum containing medium ( A , 48 h postplating ) and CAD cells following removal of serum ( B , 7 days postserum ) . Note the increase in neurite formation and the development of putative synaptic varicosities following serum deprivation . On hyperpo - larization of the membrane potential to around 2 80 mV , spon - taneous ﬁring of action potentials was routinely observed in both undifferentiated ( C ) and differentiated ( E ) CAD cells . In both phenotypes , some cells occasionally exhibited spontaneous ﬁring activities at the normal resting potential ; a representative record - ing from a differentiated CAD cell is shown ( D ) . The bars indicate a time scale of 1 min in each case . 2889 ION CHANNELS AND DIFFERENTIATION IN CAD CELLS b y 10 . 220 . 33 . 3 on S ep t e m be r 2 9 , 2016 h tt p : / / j n . ph ys i o l og y . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m Recording solutions and drugs All experimental solutions were adjusted to pH 7 . 4 and osmolarity of ; 300 mosM . The standard external solution ( SES ) contained ( in mM ) 145 NaCl , 5 KCl , 2 CaCl 2 , 1 MgCl 2 , 10 HEPES , and 10 glucose . Calcium currents were measured with barium as a charge carrier . The barium external solution ( BaES ) contained ( in mM ) 125 NaCl , 10 TEA - Cl , 10 BaCl 2 , 1 MgCl 2 , 10 HEPES , and 10 glucose . To eliminate sodium currents during potassium and calcium current measurements , 300 nM tetrodoxin ( TTX ) was added to external and drug solutions . Two internal solutions were used . “K1 . 2 , ” which was used in most experiments unless the internal solution was speciﬁed , contained ( in mM ) 130 K - Aspartate , 20 KCl , 10 HEPES , 10 glucose , 1 MgCl2 z 6 H 2 O , and 1 EGTA . “Cs1” contained ( in mM ) 145 CsCl , 10 HEPES , 10 glucose , 0 . 1 GTP , 2 MgATP , and 1 EGTA . All drugs were stored as stock solutions at 4°C and then diluted in external solution on the day of the experiment . Stock solutions of TTX ( Alomone Labs , Jerusalem , Israel ) , tetraethylammonium chloride ( TEA - Cl ; Eastman Kodak , Rochester , NY ) and 3 , 4 - diaminopyridine ( 3 , 4 - DAP ; Aldrich , Milwaukee , WI ) were made in distilled water at a concentration of 0 . 1 , 100 , and 100 mM , respectively . Ten millimolar nimodipine stock solution was made in 95 % ethanol and stored at 2 20°C . Drugs were applied from a multi - barrel pipette array built from 3 m l Drummond Microcap tubes ( Drummond Scientiﬁc , Broomall , PA ) connected to syringe reservoirs via a switching valve . Data acquisition and analysis Whole cell currents were sampled via a Digidata 1200b interface using Axotape and pClamp 6 . 0 software ( Axon Instruments , Foster City , CA ) . Data ﬁles are then imported into SigmaPlot and SigmaStat ( SPSS , Chicago , IL ) for display or analysis . Statistical signiﬁcance for comparative data was determined by a Student’s t - test and two - way ANOVA at a probability value , 0 . 05 . R E S U L T S Resting membrane potentials and action potentials of CAD cells A hallmark of neuronal cells , the ﬁring of action potentials underlies efﬁcient integration and transfer of electrical signals . To investigate the resting membrane potential and excitability of CAD cells , we performed current - clamp studies on both undifferentiated and differentiated phenotypes . In both pheno - types , the resting potentials were nearly identical , with mean values of 2 40 6 1 mV ( mean 6 SE , n 5 8 ) for undifferen - tiated CAD cells and 2 41 6 1 mV ( n 5 13 ) for differentiated CAD cells . Due to the relatively low resting potentials , only a few cells ( 1 of 7 undifferentiated CAD cells , data not shown ; and 1 of 11 differentiated CAD cells , Fig . 1 D ) exhibited spontaneous ﬁring of action potentials at the resting membrane potential . However , hyperpolarization of the membrane poten - tial to about 2 80 mV by steady injection of a small negative current permitted spontaneous ﬁring in every cell examined ( n 5 6 , undifferentiated CAD , Fig . 1 C ; and n 5 10 , differen - tiated CAD , Fig . 1 E ) . These results suggest that both pheno - types of CAD cells are excitable , but that they rarely are capable of excitation at their normally rather depolarized rest - ing potential . This situation likely reﬂects two features of the ion channel complement expressed in these cells . First , under voltage - clamp conditions , CAD cells do not display signiﬁcant inwardly rectifying currents when hyperpolarized to levels as negative as 2 120 mV ( data not shown ) . Second , more than 90 % of the sodium channels in CAD cells are inactivated at 2 40 mV ( Fig . 4 ) , thus making action potential generation problematic . General properties of voltage - dependent Na 1 and K 1 currents in CAD cells Since both phenotypes of CAD cells were excitable , we investigated and compared the voltage - dependent currents un - derlying the excitation in both phenotypes . On depolarization we observed a transient inward current and a delayed outward current in all cells examined including both undifferentiated ( n 5 50 ) and differentiated ( n 5 53 ) phenotypes . Representa - tive responses to both brief ( 15 ms ) and long ( 150 ms ) voltage steps are shown in Fig . 2 for an undifferentiated CAD cell ( A and B ) , and a differentiated CAD cell ( C and D ) . Regardless of phenotype , the transient inward current in CAD cells activated between 2 30 and 2 20 mV and reached its peak at 0 to 1 10 mV ( Fig . 2 , E and F ; (cid:130) ) consistent with the typical voltage - dependent Na 1 current recorded in other excitable cells and suggesting no signiﬁcant changes in activation properties on differentiation . One distinguishing characteristic of most neu - ronal Na 1 channels is their sensitivity to TTX . The transient inward currents in the parental CATH . a cells were shown to be TTX sensitive ( Lazaroff et al . 1996 ) . We therefore challenged CAD cells with 300 nM TTX , which totally eliminated the transient inward currents in both undifferentiated ( n 5 39 ) and differentiated ( n 5 45 ) conditions ( data not shown ) . The delayed outwardly rectifying current , most prominent in differentiated CAD cells , was observed at depolarizations above 2 20 to 0 mV ( Fig . 2 , E and F ; F ) , and is comparable to other delayed rectiﬁer K 1 currents . Transient K 1 currents ( A - type K 1 current ) have been shown to play a role in regu - lating the frequency of action potentials in neurons ( Rogawski 1985 ; Segal et al . 1984 ) . While the kinetic properties of out - ward currents elicited by standard voltage step families did not suggest a signiﬁcant inactivating current component , we fur - ther explored the expression of such channels using a prepulse inactivation voltage protocol ( see METHODS ) . The absence of any transient component evoked by depolarizations from hold - ing potentials as negative as 2 120 mV and the absence of appreciable attenuation of currents following prepulses of in - creasing depolarization indicate that few if any A - type K 1 channels are expressed in these cells ( undifferentiated n 5 8 , differentiated n 5 5 ; data not shown ) . Differentiation of CAD cells induces a reciprocal change of Na 1 and K 1 current expression As suggested by the data in Fig . 2 , differentiation might alter the relative expression of sodium and potassium channels . Assessment of our accumulated data from both differentiated and undifferentiated cells supports this idea and reveals a reciprocal change in the functional expression level of the two types of current . Speciﬁcally , in undifferentiated CAD cells , Na 1 currents were rather large and K 1 currents were relatively small . In contrast , on differentiation , Na 1 currents were dra - matically decreased while K 1 currents were signiﬁcantly in - creased ( Fig . 2 , E and F ) . Thus on differentiation of CAD cells , Na 1 and K 1 currents underwent reciprocal changes . To quan - tify this change , the average Na 1 and K 1 currents measured at 0 and 1 60 mV , respectively , were compared ( Fig . 3 ) . Normal - 2890 H . WANG AND G . S .

The dramatic reduction in sodium current density could arise from a number of different mechanisms , including changes in channel expression or gating properties . As currents were usually elicited from holding potentials of 2 60 or 2 80 mV , one particularly obvious possibility would be a shift in the voltage dependence of steady - state sodium inactivation such that more channels might simply be inactivated at these poten - tials in differentiated neurons . This mechanism has been shown to primarily account for an increase in sodium conductance on differentiation of another neuronal line , the human SH - SY5Y line ( Toselli et al . 1996 ) . We examined this possibility by comparing steady - state inactivation of sodium channels in - duced by 50 - ms prepulses from 2 120 to 1 10 mV in undiffer - entiated versus differentiated CAD cells . All cells were inter - nally dialyzed with Cs1 ( see METHODS ) to remove interference from K currents . As shown in Fig . 4 , no signiﬁcant change in either the position or voltage sensitivity of the resulting steady - state inactivation relationship is seen with differentiation of CAD cells . Thus changes in gating properties of sodium chan - nels do not appear to underlie the reduction in current density . Two distinct populations of K 1 channels were identiﬁed in both phenotypes While A - type channels do not appear to contribute to the total outward K 1 currents , we were interested in further ex - ploring the nature of the channels contributing to these cur - rents . 3 , 4 - DAP and tetraethylammonium ( TEA 1 ) are both voltage - dependent K 1 channel blockers with distinct pharma - cological mechanisms . We found that the delayed rectiﬁer K 1 currents in both differentiated ( Fig . 5 , A and B ) and undiffer - entiated CAD cells ( data not shown ) were sensitive to both 3 , 4 - DAP and TEA . However , when applying a repetitive 1 40 - mV voltage step , we observed that the dynamics of block and unblock by the two drugs were distinct . TEA 1 almost instantaneously blocked K 1 current ; likewise , the reversal of block on removing TEA 1 was also instantaneous and com - plete . The addition of 3 , 4 - DAP following equilibration with FIG . 2 . Voltage - dependent ionic currents in CAD cells in response to voltage steps from 2 80 to 1 60 mV . Represen - tative responses to both brief ( 15 ms , A and C ) and long ( 150 ms , B and D ) commands are shown . Undifferentiated CAD cells express large , transient sodium currents , but relatively small outward potassium currents ( A and B ) . In contrast , differentiation of CAD cells results in much smaller sodium currents , but a dramatic increase in outward potassium cur - rents ( C and D ) . Current - voltage ( I - V ) curves indicate that transient sodium currents were activated near approximately 2 30 mV and reached the peak at 0 – 10 mV ( E and F , (cid:130) ) ; outward potassium currents were elicited when the cells were depolarized above approximately 2 20 mV and in - creased monotonically with depolarization ( E and F , F ) .

Bars represent mean amplitudes ( 6 SE ) for sodium currents at 0 mV ( n ) and potassium currents at 1 60 mV ( o ) . The number of cells in each case is indicated above each bar . The P values for statistical comparison ( t - test ) between differentated and undifferentiated phe - notypes have been indicated also . On differentiation , a reciprocal change of Na 1 and K 1 currents was observed . Speciﬁcally , sodium currents decreased by approximately 4 - fold , and potassium currents increased by approximately 1 . 5 - fold . 2891 ION CHANNELS AND DIFFERENTIATION IN CAD CELLS b y 10 . 220 . 33 . 3 on S ep t e m be r 2 9 , 2016 h tt p : / / j n . ph ys i o l og y . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m TEA 1 failed to produce further block ( Fig . 5 C ) . In contrast to TEA 1 , both block and unblock of 3 , 4 - DAP were much slower , although the block , as for TEA 1 , was also completely revers - ible . In this case when TEA 1 was added following of the block by 3 , 4 - DAP , an additional rapid reduction in current was observed ( Fig . 5 D ) . These kinetic differences suggest that the CAD cell K 1 channels can be subdivided into distinct subpopulations ac - cording to their pharmacological sensitivity to 3 , 4 - DAP . A statistical comparison of block of delayed rectifying current in differentiated CAD cells by the two drugs revealed that nearly all K current ( 86 . 0 6 2 . 7 % ) was blocked by TEA 1 , and a subset of those channels was also sensitive to 3 , 4 - DAP ( 55 . 1 6 4 . 4 % ) . Similar percentages were found for block of the smaller currents observed in undifferentiated CAD cells ( TEA 1 sensi - tive 85 . 7 6 1 . 5 % , 3 , 4 - DAP sensitive 45 . 4 6 2 . 5 % ) , indicating that while differentiation appears to change the magnitude of total K 1 current ( see Figs . 2 and 3 ) , it does not change the relative contribution of the pharmacologically different K 1 channel populations . Ba 2 1 currents in CAD cells In neuronal cells , calcium currents play a crucial role in signal transduction , neurotransmitter secretion , neuronal mat - uration , and differentiation . In CATH . a cells , N - type and L - type Ca 2 1 currents have been previously identiﬁed ( Lazaroff et FIG . 4 . Steady - state inactivation of sodium channels is unchanged by dif - ferentiation of CAD cells . Peak sodium currents at 0 mV were measured following 50 - ms prepulses from 2 120 to 1 10 mV , normalized to the maxi - mum current in each cell , averaged and plotted as a function of the prepulse voltage ( mean 6 SE ) for undifferentiated ( E , n 5 9 ) and differentiated ( F , n 5 9 ) phenotypes . A 1 - ms interval to 2 90 mV between prepulse and test pulse ensured resetting of the activation gating between trials .

Fit parameters for undifferentiated cells are V 0 . 5 5 2 64 . 3 mV , k 5 7 . 7 mV , and for differentiated cells V 0 . 5 5 2 60 . 8 mV , k 5 2 8 . 9 mV . FIG . 5 .

Given that CAD cells are excitable and express both Na 1 and K 1 currents , we were interested in investigating Ca 2 1 currents . We enhanced calcium channel currents by using 10 mM Ba 2 1 as the charge carrier , and Cs 1 as the only internal monovalent cation to eliminate the K 1 currents . In both un - differentiated ( Fig . 6 A ) and differentiated ( Fig . 6 C ) CAD cells , an inward current with characteristics expected for a voltage - dependent calcium channel current was routinely observed . The dominant current component in both phenotypes was a transient current that completely inactivated in undifferentiated cells . In contrast , differentiated cells exhibited an additional steady - state component maintained for the duration of the voltage step . The current - voltage ( I - V ) curves of the peak Ba 2 1 currents showed that regardless the phenotype , the threshold for activation was around 2 50 mV and the maximum value occurred at about 2 20 to 2 10 mV ( Fig . 6 , E and F , (cid:130) ) . The inward Ba 2 1 currents could be completely and reversibly blocked by 50 m M Cd 2 1 in both phenotypes ( data not shown ) . To compare Ba 2 1 currents between the two phenotypes , the maximum currents at 0 mV were measured and normalized to the cell size , yielding nearly identical current densities of 7 6 1 pA / pF ( n 5 24 ) and 6 6 1 pA / pF ( n 5 17 ) in undifferentiated and differentiated phenotypes , respectively ( P . 0 . 05 ) . To further identify the Ca 2 1 channel subtypes underlying these different kinetic components , we challenged the cells with 10 m M nimodipine , an L - type Ca 2 1 channel blocker . In undifferentiated phenotype , 10 m M nimodipine was able to almost completely and reversibly block the transient Ba 2 1 currents ( Fig . 6 B ) , suggesting that L - type channels are the only channels functionally expressed in undifferentiated CAD cells . In the differentiated phenotype , nimodipine also completely blocked the transient current component ; however , a distinct nimodipine - resistant component remained with a relatively slow , maintained activation ( Fig . 6 D ) . This nimodipine - resis - tant component did not activate until about 2 30 mV and peaked at about 2 10 to 0 mV ( Fig . 6 F , F ) . Subtracting the nimodipine - resistant currents from the total Ba 2 1 currents , we calculated the nimodipine - sensitive Ba 2 1 current density , which was comparable between undifferentiated and differen - tiated phenotypes ( Fig . 6 G , n , P . 0 . 05 ) . In contrast , the much smaller nimodipine - resistant component was increased by two - fold on differentiation ( Fig . 6 G , o , P , 0 . 02 ) . As the nimo - dipine - resistant component only accounted for a very small portion of the total Ba 2 1 currents , we did not characterize it in further using other pharmacological tools . Hence , we conclude that in both phenotypes , the major Ca 2 1 channel component is L - type ; nevertheless , on differentiation , expression of another distinct nimodipine - resistant Ca 2 1 channel type is induced . D I S C U S S I O N The parental CATH . a cell line has been extensively inves - tigated due to its CNS origin and promise as a potential catecholaminergic neuronal line . The three major subtypes of opioid receptor have been found in CATH . a cells ( Baraban et al . 1995 ; Bouvier et al . 1998 ) , and K 1 channels in these cells can be regulated by kappa - opioid receptors ( Baraban et al . 1995 ) . Also reports indicate that both dopamine ( Masserano et al . 1996 ; Smith et al . 1998 ) and nitric oxide donors ( Smith et al . 1998 ) can induce time - and dose - dependent apoptosis in CATH . a cells . However , these cells do not exhibit neuronal morphology , and there are no reports of spontaneous action potential activity despite the expression of voltage - dependent Na 1 , K 1 , and Ca 2 1 currents ( Lazaroff et al . 1996 ) . The novel CAD subclone , however , appears to maintain the expression of ion channels , while losing the oncogene that drove the original tumor production for the parental line and gaining the ability to express neuronal morphology with inducible differentiation . We have conﬁrmed that serum deprivation induces morpho - FIG . 6 . Inward barium currents through voltage - dependent calcium chan - nels were manifested in both undifferentiated ( A ) and differentiated ( C ) CAD cells dialyzed with Cs 1 internal solutions and bathed in 10 mM barium external solution ( BaES ) with 300 nM tetrodotoxin ( TTX ) . Current families elicited by voltage steps from 2 80 to 1 60 mV from a holding potential of 2 80 mV . In the undifferentiated phenotype , the Ba 2 1 currents exhibited a relatively fast activation followed by a signiﬁcant inactivation and were almost com - pletely eliminated by 10 m M nimodipine ( B ) . In contrast , the differentiated phenotype exhibited an identical nimodipine - sensitive component , but an additional nimodipine - resistant sustained component was clearly identiﬁed with a relatively slow activation ( D ) . In both phenotypes , the threshold for the peak Ba 2 1 currents was about 2 60 mV , and the peak occurred at about 2 20 to 2 10 mV ( E , undifferentiated ; F , differentiated , (cid:130) ) . The I - V curve of the nimodipine - resistant component indicates that it increases on differentiation and activates at more positive membrane potentials ( E and F , F ) . G : the nimodipine - sensitive component ( total current 2 current after nimodipine , n ) was comparable in both phenotypes , while a 2 - fold increase of nimodipine - resistant component ( o ) occurred on differentiation . UD and D stand for undifferentiated and differentiated , respectively .

On differentiation , exten - sive neurite outgrowth and synaptic varicosities were evi - denced ( Fig . 1 ) . Other tumor - derived cell lines have been previously shown to express a neuronal morphological pheno - type on differentiation induced by agents such as nerve growth factor ( e . g . , PC - 12 cells ) or retinoic acid ( e . g . , SH - SY5Y cells ) . Furthermore , in these two cell lines , such neuronal - like differ - entiation also results in an increase in the functional expression of voltage - gated sodium channels ( Greene and Tischler 1976 ; Toselli et al . 1996 ) . In examining the corresponding changes in ion current expression on CAD cell differentiation , we made an unexpected observation . In CAD cells there is a reciprocal change of Na 1 and K 1 currents on differentiation reﬂecting a 4 - fold decrease of Na 1 current and 1 . 5 - fold increase of K 1 current . There are at least three possible mechanisms that could contribute to these changes . First , changes in gating properties , most importantly channel inactivation behavior , through post - translational modiﬁcations might effect a change in open prob - ability and thus current density . This mechanism is unlikely , however , in the case of CAD cell differentiation as the steady - state sodium inactivation behavior is not changed with differ - entiation ( Fig . 4 ) and no signiﬁcant inactivating K channels were observed in either phenotype . This is quite different from the observation of increases in sodium current documented during retinoic acid induced differentiation of SH - SY5Y cells ( Toselli et al . 1996 ) . In that case , the steady - state sodium inactivation curve was found to be shifted by nearly 25 mV to the right along the voltage axis . This shift coupled with the holding potential used in those experiments can account for most , if not all , of the increase in sodium conductance seen with differentiation . The second mechanism possibly underlying the changes in current density in CAD cells is a change in the level of expression of genes coding for the relevant channel types . Without knowing which isoforms of voltage - dependent Na 1 or K 1 channels are expressed by CAD cells , we have not at - tempted to assess this possibility . Third , it is possible that the level of Na 1 channel gene expression was comparable between these two phenotypes , but the cellular distribution of channels was altered on differentiation . In undifferentiated CAD cells , all Na 1 channels are necessarily located at the soma as no neurites are expressed ; however , when cells are differentiated , there may be a redistribution of Na 1 channels coincident with the growth of processes . During voltage clamp , control of the membrane potential in the remote neurite compartments may well be less than adequate , and the degree of depolarization induced in distal neurites may be diminished and hence chan - nel activation compromised . If sodium channels were prefer - entially expressed in the neurite compartment , their contribu - tion to currents during voltage - clamp measurements might be signiﬁcantly reduced in differentiated CAD cells . In addition , there was an increase of K 1 channel expression on differenti - ation , but the relative expression ratio of different pharmaco - logical subpopulations was unchanged . To address the possible mechanisms involved , further experiments assessing channel mRNA expression or direct assessment of currents in neurites are required . Whether the current density changes reﬂect changes in expression or redistribution , both phenotypes were capable of generating action potentials , thus the changes ob - served may not have functional consequences . The pharmacology of CAD cell K currents revealed by TEA 1 and 3 , 4 - DAP is consistent with other studies ( Kirsch et al . 1986 , 1991 ; Purali and Rydqvist 1992 ; Wagoner and Oxford 1990 ) . Two classes of K channel exist in these neurons . One is sensitive to TEA 1 alone , while the other is sensitive to both blockers . Not only do current magnitudes reveal these two classes , but the characteristic differences in blocking kinetics conﬁrm two populations of channel , both of which exhibit delayed rectiﬁer properties . Neither A - type channels nor in - wardly rectifying K channels ( e . g . , Kir2 family ) signiﬁcantly contribute to K currents in CAD cells . High - voltage – activated Ca 2 1 channels have also been iden - tiﬁed in both phenotypes . The overwhelming fraction of the barium currents in both phenotypes was blocked by nimodi - pine , thus being classiﬁed as reﬂecting L - type Ca 2 1 channels . On differentiation , a distinct nimodipine - resistant component was induced . Shifts in expression of different Ca 2 1 channel types with the different neuronal developmental stages has been reported previously ( Chameau et al . 1999 ; Desmadryl et al . 1998 ) . While the induced divalent conductance seen with differentiation did not exhibit inactivation , it was insensitive to nimodipine and thus not a conventional L - type channel . The nature of this conductance was difﬁcult to explore reliably with routine pharmacology ( e . g . , selective toxins ) due to its small magnitude . Contrary to the conventional neuronal L - type Ca 2 1 channel , which exhibits little if any inactivation when Ba 2 1 was used as the charge carrier , the L - type Ca 2 1 channel in both CAD cell phenotypes manifested a signiﬁcant inactivation even Ba 2 1 was used . That might suggest that a particular splice variant of a 1C subunit is expressed by CAD cells and caused strong acceleration of the Ba 2 1 current inactivation ( Soldatov et al . 1998 ) . In addition , some b subunits have been reported to modulate both voltage - dependent and Ca 2 1 - dependent Ca 2 1 channel inactivation kinetics ( Cens et al . 1999 ) . From the functional perspective , our studies suggest that the CAD cell line exhibits the most important features of a purely CNS - derived catecholaminergic neuronal cell making it a use - ful tool for in vitro study . Differentiation is not a simple morphological change , but a change of channel expression and perhaps distribution . Further studies on CAD cells may help us to better understand the physiological functions of voltage - dependent ion channels in neuronal differentiation , and yield further understanding of molecular and electrophysiological nature of CNS - derived catecholaminergic neurons .
