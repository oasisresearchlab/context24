Actin filament nucleators are key 46 players in this activity and include the conserved Actin - Related Protein 2 / 3 ( Arp2 / 3 ) complex , 47 that creates dendritic networks of branched filaments , as well as a large family of formins that 48 typically generate long , unbranched filaments and bundles . In some eukaryotic cells , these 49 nucleators compete for a common pool of actin monomers and loss of one favors the activity of 50 the other . To test whether this is a common mechanism , we combined the ability to image single 51 filament dynamics in the homeostatic cortical actin array of living Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis 52 thaliana ) epidermal cells with genetic and / or small molecule inhibitor approaches to stably or 53 acutely disrupt nucleator activity . We found that Arp2 / 3 mutants or acute CK - 666 treatment 54 markedly reduced the frequency of side - branched nucleation events as well as overall actin 55 filament abundance . We also confirmed that plant formins contribute to side - branched filament 56 nucleation in vivo . Surprisingly , simultaneous inhibition of both classes of nucleator increased 57 overall actin filament abundance and enhanced the frequency of de novo nucleation events by 58 an unknown mechanism . Collectively , our findings suggest that multiple actin nucleation 59 mechanisms cooperate to generate and maintain the homeostatic cortical array of plant 60 epidermal cells . 61 62 3 Introduction 63 The actin cytoskeleton comprises a dynamic network of filaments that participates in a wide 64 variety of cellular activities , including vesicle / organelle trafficking , cell expansion , cellulose 65 synthesis , tissue / organelle development , and resistance to microbial pathogen invasion ( Gao et 66 al . , 2009 ; Sampathkumar et al . , 2013 ; Peremyslov et al . , 2015 ; Scheuring et al . , 2016 ; Qi and 67 Greb , 2017 ; Li and Staiger , 2018 ; Zhang et al . , 2019 ) . Plant cells rearrange their actin 68 cytoskeleton organization on timescales of seconds to minutes in response to biotic or abiotic 69 stimuli , which means the actin cytoskeleton organization is extremely dynamic but also precisely 70 controlled ( Staiger et al . , 2009 ; Henty - Ridilla et al . , 2013b ) . Regulation of cytoskeletal 71 organization and dynamics involves dozens of actin - binding proteins that participate in filament 72 nucleation , elongation , severing , and depolymerization . Nucleation factors or nucleators initiate 73 the formation of new actin filaments at a much faster rate than spontaneous nucleation from free 74 actin monomers and are therefore considered key regulators of array formation and actin 75 dynamics ( Kadzik et al . , 2020 ; Rosenbloom et al . , 2021 ) . Previous in - vitro studies , primarily 76 from non - plant systems , have identified and characterized two classes of conserved actin 77 nucleator , the Actin - Related Protein 2 / 3 ( Arp2 / 3 ) complex and formins , with different specific 78 activation mechanisms ( Kovar , 2006 ; Pollard , 2007 ; Paul and Pollard , 2008 ; Burke et al . , 2014 ; 79 Suarez et al . , 2015 ) . 80 The Arp2 / 3 complex is a seven - subunit protein complex responsible for generating 81 branched actin filaments and forming dendritic actin networks in eukaryotic cells ( Mullins et al . , 82 1998 ; Pollard , 2007 ) . The ARP2 and ARP3 subunits mimic the structure of actin monomers . 83 Once the Arp2 / 3 complex is activated , the ARP2 and ARP3 subunits along with a recruited actin 84 monomer serve as the actin nucleus for the polymerization of a new ( daughter ) filament , which 85 grows from the side of a pre - existing ( mother ) actin filament with a characteristic 70° angle 86 ( Mullins et al . , 1998 ; Dayel and Mullins , 2004 ; Pollard , 2007 ; Beltzner and Pollard , 2008 ; 87 Rouiller et al . , 2008 ) . This branched actin network structure is critical for many cellular 88 processes in yeast and animal cells , such as cell division , cell migration , exocytosis , 89 endocytosis and tissue or embryo development ( Roh - Johnson and Goldstein , 2009 ; Cabrera et 90 al . , 2011 ; Sun et al . , 2013 ; van der Kammen et al . , 2017 ) . In contrast , plants , such as 91 Arabidopsis , with mutations in Arp2 / 3 subunits have relatively normal morphology and fertility ; 92 however , arp2 / 3 mutants exhibit defects in epidermal cell morphology including distorted 93 trichomes , cell - cell adhesion defects , and fewer lobes on leaf pavement cells ( Szymanski et al . , 94 1999 ; Le et al . , 2003 ; Li et al . , 2003 ; Mathur et al . , 2003a ; Harries et al . , 2005 ; Yanagisawa et 95 4 al . , 2015 ) . Recent research shows that the plant Arp2 / 3 complex is also involved in auxin 96 transport ( Peng et al . , 2017 ; Sahi et al . , 2018 ; García - González et al . , 2020 ) , guard cell opening 97 and closing ( Jiang et al . , 2012 ; Li et al . , 2014 ) , resistance to penetration - mediated infection by 98 fungal pathogens ( Qin et al . , 2021 ) , and possibly in autophagy ( Wang et al . , 2016 ; Wang et al . , 99 2019 ) . Many of these studies reveal that arp2 / 3 mutant cells have reduced actin filament 100 abundance or misaligned actin bundles , suggesting that the functions of the Arp2 / 3 complex 101 may be accomplished through generating specific actin structures . In growing trichome 102 branches , for example , the Arp2 / 3 complex generates a tip - localized actin filament array 103 constrained by cortical microtubules that coordinates growth ( Yanagisawa et al . , 2015 ; 104 Yanagisawa et al . , 2018 ) . During fungal invasion , the Arp2 / 3 complex localizes to the site of 105 penetration peg attack in epidermal pavement cells and generates a cortical actin filament patch 106 necessary to suppress invasion ( Qin et al . , 2021 ) . However , the molecular mechanisms by 107 which the Arp2 / 3 complex coordinates the organization of cortical actin filament arrays in 108 unstimulated cells or how it generates unique arrays in response to biotic and abiotic stress are 109 poorly understood . 110 Formins represent another family of evolutionarily - conserved actin filament nucleators ; 111 they typically generate long linear actin filaments that can bundle together to form actin cables 112 ( Kovar , 2006 ; Pollard , 2007 ; Paul and Pollard , 2008 ) . These actin cables provide tracks for 113 intracellular organelle / vesicle trafficking . Formins have two universally conserved formin - 114 homology ( FH ) domains , FH1 and FH2 . The proline - rich FH1 domain allows formins to recruit 115 profilin - bound actin to elongate actin filaments at the barbed ends . The FH2 domain , on the 116 other hand , associates with other regions within itself for autoinhibition or it can interact with the 117 FH2 domain of another formin to form a dimer that interacts with and suitably positions two actin 118 monomers , thereby initiating the nucleation of linear actin filaments ( Cvrčková et al . , 2000 ; 119 Deeks et al . , 2002 ; Cheung and Wu , 2004 ; Cvrčková et al . , 2004 ; Kovar , 2006 ; Michelot et al . , 120 2006 ; Pollard , 2007 ; Paul and Pollard , 2008 ) . There are 21 formin homologs in Arabidopsis and 121 these are separated into two phylogenetic subclasses ( Cvrčková et al . , 2000 ) . Based on 122 sequence prediction , Class I formins have a signal peptide and an N - terminal transmembrane 123 domain that target them to the plasma membrane , whereas Class II formins are predicted to 124 have more diverse domain organization ( Cvrčková et al . , 2000 ; Deeks et al . , 2002 ; Cheung and 125 Wu , 2004 ; Cvrčková et al . , 2004 ; Michelot et al . , 2006 ) . In addition , plant formin orthologs can 126 be categorized according to the ability to associate with filament barbed ends and elongate 127 growing filaments . Processive formins remain attached to the actin filament barbed end and 128 5 move processively as the filament elongates , whereas non - processive formins remain at the 129 filament nucleation site ( Cvrčková et al . , 2000 ; Deeks et al . , 2002 ; Cheung and Wu , 2004 ; 130 Cvrčková et al . , 2004 ; Michelot et al . , 2005 ; Michelot et al . , 2006 ; Zhang et al . , 2016 ) . 131 Biochemical results reveal that a non - processive Class I formin , FORMIN1 ( AFH1 ) , attaches to 132 the side of a pre - existing actin filament to nucleate new filaments , suggesting a far more 133 complicated role for formins in plant cells than just the ability to generate linear filaments 134 ( Michelot et al . , 2006 ) . In addition , both in - vivo and in - vitro experiments show that formins are 135 critical for maintaining homeostatic actin array organization as well as regulating polarized cell 136 growth ( Vidali et al . , 2009 ; Rosero et al . , 2013 ; Lan et al . , 2018 ) . However , the detailed 137 molecular mechanism of how formins regulate cytoskeletal organization and single actin 138 filament dynamics in plant cells remains unclear . 139 The decision of when and where to generate an actin array as well as its specific 140 structure and dynamics is essential for each actin array to specifically choreograph its cellular 141 function and often requires coordination between the Arp2 / 3 complex and formins . Studies in 142 fission yeast and some animal cells indicate that the Arp2 / 3 complex and formins compete for a 143 limited supply of actin monomers and this competition prevents excessive activity of one or the 144 other , thereby allowing cells to generate distinct actin structures and dynamics by regulating the 145 balance of activities between these two nucleators ( Hotulainen and Lappalainen , 2006 ; Lomakin 146 et al . , 2015 ; Suarez et al . , 2015 ; Davidson et al . , 2018 ; Antkowiak et al . , 2019 ; Chan et al . , 147 2019 ; Kadzik et al . , 2020 ) . During actin array assembly , the Arp2 / 3 complex generates 148 branched filament arrays , whereas formins produce linear filament bundles ( Carlier and 149 Shekhar , 2017 ) . Furthermore , in - vitro studies reveal that filaments generated by formins grow 150 faster than Arp2 / 3 - nucleated filaments ( Vavylonis et al . , 2006 ; Michelot et al . , 2013 ; Suarez et 151 al . , 2015 ; Funk et al . , 2019 ) . Studies with M2 melanoma cells and HeLa cells illustrate that actin 152 arrays generated by different nucleators have distinct properties of filament abundance , filament 153 length , and turnover kinetics , but also reveal that both nucleators contribute to maintenance and 154 turnover of the homeostatic actin cortex ( Fritzsche et al . , 2016 ) . A recent study in Arabidopsis 155 shows that actin arrays in cotyledon epidermal pavement cells are slightly more dense and the 156 extent of bundling is unchanged when either a Class I formin , AFH1 , or the Arp2 / 3 subunit , 157 ARPC5 , are genetically down - regulated ; however , single filament dynamics or nucleation events 158 were not evaluated directly ( Cifrová et al . , 2020 ) . The authors propose that the Arp2 / 3 complex 159 and formins in plants may have complementary roles to overcome the loss of the other . 160 Therefore , it is important to understand how each nucleator regulates the structure and dynamic 161 6 properties of actin arrays individually to better understand how they contribute to the cortical 162 actin homeostasis and how they are coordinated to regulate the actin cytoskeleton during 163 different biological processes . 164 Quantitative analysis of single actin filament dynamics in vivo is relatively hard to 165 conduct in yeast and mammalian cells , because either the cells are too small or the actin arrays 166 are too dense and filament lengths are below the limits of resolution of light microscopy . 167 Epidermal cells from dark - grown Arabidopsis hypocotyls are large in size and have relatively 168 sparse actin arrays in the cortical cytoplasm , making this a powerful model system for 169 quantitative analysis of single actin filament dynamics , especially when combined with high 170 spatial and temporal resolution imaging approaches and genetically - encoded fluorescence 171 reporters ( Staiger et al . , 2009 ; Henty et al . , 2011 ; Henty - Ridilla et al . , 2013a ; Cai et al . , 2014 ; 172 Cao et al . , 2016 ; Arieti and Staiger , 2020 ) . Previous work demonstrates a remarkably high rate 173 of new filament construction , rapid growth at filament ends , and disassembly by prolific severing 174 activity in a mechanism termed “stochastic dynamics” ( Staiger et al . , 2009 ) . High rates of 175 polymerization are likely supported by a large pool of monomeric actin that is buffered with an 176 excess of the monomer - binding protein , profilin , to suppress spontaneous nucleation events 177 ( Chaudhry et al . , 2007 ; Staiger et al . , 2009 ; Cao et al . , 2016 ) . The ability to observe both actin 178 filament architecture and activities of single filaments in living cells allows direct visualization 179 and quantitative analysis of the effects associated with the disruption of actin nucleators on 180 filament activities in vivo ( Cao et al . , 2016 ) . 181 In this study , we test the hypothesis that the Arabidopsis Arp2 / 3 complex mediates 182 nucleation of side - branched filaments in vivo but does not facilitate filament elongation directly . 183 We used both genetic and pharmacological approaches to disrupt Arp2 / 3 complex activity in 184 plant cells . With quantitative live - cell imaging at single filament resolution , we demonstrated 185 directly that the Arp2 / 3 complex is responsible for the nucleation of side - branched filaments in 186 vivo . We also characterized the difference between the Arp2 / 3 complex and formins with 187 respect to the dynamic behaviors of the filaments they generate and evaluated the 188 consequence of losing both classes of filament nucleator on actin organization and dynamics . 189 Surprisingly , living plant cells deficient for two classes of nucleator generate comparatively 190 normal and dynamic actin arrays by an apparent de novo filament nucleation mechanism . 191 192 7 Results 193 Arabidopsis plants have defects in general growth and epidermal cell morphology when 194 deficient for the Arp2 / 3 complex 195 Previous studies of Arp2 / 3 complex mutants reveal defects in Arabidopsis epidermal cell growth 196 and morphology ( Szymanski et al . , 1999 ; Le et al . , 2003 ; Li et al . , 2003 ; Mathur et al . , 2003b ; 197 Harries et al . , 2005 ; Facette et al . , 2015 ; Yanagisawa et al . , 2015 ; Cifrová et al . , 2020 ) . Here , 198 we acquired a T - DNA insertion mutant for ARP2 , arp2 - 1 ( or wrm1 - 2 ; SALK _ 003448 ) , and a 199 point mutation of ARPC2 , arpc2 ( or dis2 - 1 ; El - Assal et al . , 2004 ) , and confirmed the cell and 200 organ growth phenotypes . We observed that both arp2 - 1 and arpc2 homozygous mutant plants 201 had adhesion defects at end walls of hypocotyl epidermal cells and severely distorted leaf 202 trichomes when compared to wild - type sibling lines ( Supplemental Fig . S1A ) . In addition , 203 etiolated hypocotyls from arp2 - 1 and arpc2 seedlings were significantly shorter than wild - type 204 seedlings at the same time points ( Supplemental Fig . S1 , B and C ) . To test whether these 205 growth defects resulted from defects in cell expansion , we examined epidermal cell length and 206 found that cells in all regions of etiolated arp2 / 3 hypocotyls were significantly shorter compared 207 to wild - type hypocotyls ; however , cell widths were not affected ( Supplemental Fig . S1 , D and E ) . 208 Similar results for root growth were observed in light - grown seedlings ( Supplemental Fig . S1 , F 209 and G ) . These results confirm that the Arp2 / 3 complex plays a role in axial cell expansion in 210 both dark - grown hypocotyls and light - grown roots of Arabidopsis . 211 Actin filament abundance and bundling are reduced in arp2 / 3 mutants 212 To assess the influence of the Arp2 / 3 complex on cortical actin cytoskeletal organization , we 213 compared images of epidermal cells from the apical region of 5 - d - old etiolated wild - type , arp2 - 1 , 214 and arpc2 hypocotyls collected by variable - angle epifluorescence microscopy ( VAEM ) ( Staiger 215 et al . , 2009 ) . Homozygous mutant and isogenic wild - type sibling lines that express the actin 216 reporter , green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) fused with FIMBRIN1 actin - binding domain 2 or GFP - 217 fABD2 ( Sheahan et al . , 2004 ) were prepared by crossing to facilitate the observation and 218 measurement of actin cytoskeleton organization and filament dynamics ( Staiger et al . , 2009 ) . 219 The actin array structure in arp2 - 1 and arpc2 cells had fewer , thinner , and more scattered 220 filaments compared to corresponding wild - type cells ( Fig . 1A ) . To compare these differences 221 quantitively , we used density , skewness and the coefficient of variation ( CV ) as three key 222 parameters established previously for standardized descriptions of actin cytoskeleton array 223 organization in living cells ( Higaki et al . , 2010 ; Ueda et al . , 2010 ; Henty et al . , 2011 ; Higaki et 224 8 al . , 2020 ) . Density measures the percentage of occupancy of actin filaments in an array , 225 whereas both skewness and CV define the extent of bundling of actin filaments . CV uses a 226 different calculation method compared to skewness , and is reportedly a better indicator of 227 bundling , especially for VAEM images ( Higaki et al . , 2020 ) . Actin density in arp2 - 1 and arpc2 228 cells was significantly decreased compared to the respective wild - type cells ( Fig . 1B ) , and the 229 extent of filament bundling was significantly reduced as well when measured by skewness or 230 CV methods ( Fig . 1C and D ) . These results demonstrate that the Arp2 / 3 complex contributes to 231 the generation of both individual filaments and filament bundles and is necessary for 232 maintaining the homeostatic organization of the cortical actin cytoskeleton in epidermal cells . 233 The Arp2 / 3 complex plays a significant role in filament nucleation and generation of side - 234 branched filaments 235 To investigate whether the Arp2 / 3 complex participates in actin filament nucleation , we 236 measured single actin filament formation and dynamics in wild - type and arp2 / 3 mutant cells by 237 collecting time - lapse movies from the apical regions of 5 - d - old dark - grown hypocotyls with 238 VAEM . The sparse nature of the cortical actin array in hypocotyl epidermal cells and the high 239 spatial and temporal resolution afforded by VAEM allowed us to visualize ( Fig . 2A ) and quantify 240 individual nucleation events with a previously described assay ( Cao et al . , 2016 ) . Briefly , we 241 counted all new or regrowing filaments identified in multiple 400 µm 2 regions of interest ( ROI ) 242 within a cell during a 100 - s time - lapse movie . The nucleation frequency was normalized to the 243 average filament number within each ROI to minimize the influence of filament abundance 244 differences between ROIs and genotypes . The overall nucleation frequency in arp2 - 1 cells ( 0 . 38 245 ± 0 . 03 events / filament / min ) was significantly decreased compared to wild - type cells ( 0 . 62 ± 0 . 05 246 events / filament / min ) ( Fig . 2B ; Supplemental Movie S1 ; Supplemental Movie S2 ) and coincided 247 with our observation that loss of function of the Arp2 / 3 complex resulted in a significant 248 reduction in filament abundance ( Fig . 1B ) . Similar reductions in overall nucleation frequency 249 were also observed for arpc2 compared to wild - type cells ( Supplemental Fig . S2A ) . Next , we 250 classified nucleation events into three different subpopulations based on filament origin : de novo 251 from the cytoplasm ; from the side of a pre - existing filament or bundle ; or , from the end of a pre - 252 existing filament ( Fig . 2A ; Supplemental Movies S3 to S5 ) ( Staiger et al . , 2009 ; Henty - Ridilla et 253 al . , 2013a ; Cao et al . , 2016 ) . Only the side - branched nucleation frequency was significantly 254 decreased in arp2 - 1 and arpc2 cells compared to the respective wild - type sibling cells ( Fig . 2C – 255 E ; Supplemental Movies S1 and S2 ; Supplemental Fig . S2 , C – E ) . Side - branched nucleation 256 9 events contribute about half of all new filament origins and these were reduced by 60 – 70 % in 257 the arp2 / 3 mutants . 258 A previous study reports different results regarding the actin organization in arp2 / 3 259 mutants ; instead of significantly decreased filament abundance as observed here , a minor 260 increase in actin filament density in arpc5 cotyledon pavement cells was reported ( Cifrová et al . , 261 2020 ) . These differences could result from the use of a different arp2 / 3 complex subunit 262 mutation , the investigation of epidermal cells from a different tissue , the choice of actin 263 cytoskeleton reporter , or all of the above . Several previous publications show that LifeAct 264 reduces both the actin reorganization rate and actin polymerization rate ( van der Honing et al . , 265 2011 ; Spracklen et al . , 2014 ; Courtemanche et al . , 2016 ) , and displays longer and thicker 266 filaments ( Flores et al . , 2019 ) . To test which factors led to differing results between the current 267 work and that of Cifrová et al . ( 2020 ) , we conducted a direct comparison between the ability of 268 GFP - fABD2 or GFP - LifeAct to report actin architecture and single filament dynamics in either 269 etiolated hypocotyls ( Supplemental Fig . S3 ) or light - grown cotyledons ( Supplemental Fig . S4 ) . 270 Moreover , we introduced GFP - LifeAct into arp2 - 1 to compare directly with the GFP - fABD2 arp2 - 271 1 reporter line described above . Our results showed that arp2 - 1 expressing either GFP - fABD2 272 or GFP - LifeAct had significantly lower actin filament density in the cortical array of both etiolated 273 hypocotyl and light - grown cotyledon epidermal cells ( Supplemental Fig . S3B and S4B ) . 274 Similarly , overall actin filament nucleation frequency and the side - branched nucleation subclass 275 were significantly reduced in arp2 - 1 epidermal cells from both reporter lines , in either hypocotyls 276 or cotyledons , compared to the corresponding wild - type lines ( Supplemental Fig . S3 , E – H ; 277 Supplemental Fig . S4 , E – H ) . These results suggest that using GFP - fABD2 as the actin reporter , 278 or imaging epidermal cells of the etiolated hypocotyl , are not causal for the actin phenotypes we 279 observed in arp2 / 3 mutants . Because it is beyond the scope of the current investigation , we did 280 not seek to determine whether the previous findings are specific to the arpc5 mutant allele used , 281 but note that we find similar quantitative differences in actin architecture and nucleation 282 frequency with mutations in two different subunits ( arp2 - 1 and arpc2 ) of the Arp2 / 3 complex . 283 Considering the nature of the LifeAct marker in stabilizing actin structures and our primary goal 284 of observing and analyzing the dynamic behaviors of single actin filaments , we used the GFP - 285 fABD2 marker lines for the remainder of the experiments in this study . 286 Actin filaments generated by the Arp2 / 3 complex have unique dynamic properties 287 To understand how the Arp2 / 3 complex influences the dynamics of actin filaments , we tracked 288 many dozens of individual filaments from their first appearance to complete disappearance and 289 10 measured several parameters that were previously established to describe actin filament 290 turnover ( Fig . 3A ; Table 1 ; Supplemental Movies S6 and S7 ) ( Staiger et al . , 2009 ; Henty et al . , 291 2011 ) . Compared to wild type , the population distribution of actin filament elongation rates in 292 arp2 - 1 cells was more left skewed , and the average filament elongation rate was also higher 293 ( Fig . 3B ; Table 1 ) , indicating that actin filaments were growing significantly faster in arp2 - 1 cells . 294 It is also obvious that there were two or three distinct populations of filament elongation rates 295 with peaks at 0 . 75 – 1 . 25 , 2 . 0 – 2 . 25 , and > 3 µm / s with the latter two categories becoming 296 more prevalent in arp2 - 1 cells ( Fig . 3B ) . Similar differences in overall elongation rate and fast - 297 growing filament populations were observed in arpc2 ( Supplemental Table S1 ; Supplemental 298 Fig . S2B ) . Filaments in both arp2 - 1 and arpc2 mutant cells also had significantly longer filament 299 lengths and lifetimes than the ones in respective wild - type cells ( Table 1 ; Supplemental Table 300 S1 ) . 301 Previous in vitro data suggest that filament ends generated by the Arp2 / 3 complex and 302 formins have different elongation rates ; many formins are processive polymerases that use 303 profilin - actin to add monomers to growing filaments ( Kovar et al . , 2003 ; Romero et al . , 2004 ; 304 Akin and Mullins , 2008 ; Zhang et al . , 2016 ) . To test whether dynamic properties of filaments 305 with different nucleation patterns are distinct from each other , we measured the full suite of 306 dynamic parameters for each population . We found that side - branched filaments in arp2 - 1 cells 307 were significantly longer ( Fig . 3 , C – E ) and filament lifetime was prolonged ( Fig . 3 , F – H ) 308 compared to the side - branched filaments in wild - type cells ; however , the severing frequency did 309 not show a significant difference between wild - type and arp2 - 1 cells ( Fig . 3 , I – K ) . These 310 dynamic differences between side - branched filaments in arpc2 mutant and wild - type sibling 311 cells were conserved ( Supplemental Fig . S2 , C – K ) . 312 Collectively , these data demonstrate that the Arp2 / 3 complex is responsible for 313 generating new filaments from the side of pre - existing filaments and is necessary for cells to 314 maintain the homeostatic actin cytoskeleton architecture . Moreover , Arp2 / 3 - nucleated filaments 315 have distinct dynamic properties compared with those generated de novo or from the end of a 316 pre - existing filament ; in particular , they grow slower and are shorter , and have reduced filament 317 lifetimes . 318 The small molecule inhibitor CK - 666 phenocopies actin - based defects in arp2 and arpc2 319 mutants 320 11 Several studies report that CK - 666 , a small molecule inhibitor of the Arp2 / 3 complex that is 321 effective on yeast and animal cells ( Nolen et al . , 2009 ; Hetrick et al . , 2013 ) , phenocopies the 322 effects of arp2 / 3 mutants on tomato pollen tube growth ( Liu et al . , 2020 ) and Arabidopsis sperm 323 nuclear migration ( Ali et al . , 2020 ) , both of which depend upon the actin cytoskeleton . Moreover , 324 a recent study demonstrates that CK - 666 treatment does not influence actin redistribution 325 between the basal and apical cell region in hypocotyl epidermal cells that occurs during early 326 embryo growth ( Cui et al . , 2023 ) . Because the earlier studies ( Liu et al . , 2020 ; Ali et al . , 2020 ) 327 did not directly demonstrate the effects of CK - 666 on actin organization or filament nucleation , it 328 is necessary to validate whether CK - 666 influences the function of the Arp2 / 3 complex in plant 329 cells , as a side - branched actin filament nucleator , before we use it as an effective plant Arp2 / 3 330 inhibitor . We hypothesized that applying CK - 666 to wild - type Arabidopsis cells would inhibit the 331 Arp2 / 3 complex activity and mimic the arp2 / 3 mutant phenotypes described above . To test the 332 effects of CK - 666 , we applied a dose series ( 0 , 1 , 5 , 10 , 50 , and 100 µM ) for 5 min and collected 333 snapshots of epidermal cells from the apical region of treated hypocotyls ( Supplemental Fig . 334 S5 ) . Compared to the mock treatment ( 0 µM ) , CK - 666 showed a significant reduction in both 335 filament density and the extent of bundling starting at 5 µM and reached its maximum effect at 336 50 – 100 µM ( Supplemental Fig . S5 , B – D ) . A time - course ( 0 , 5 , 10 , 30 , and 60 min ) of 10 µM CK - 337 666 treatment showed that 5 min was sufficient to alter actin array organization ( Supplemental 338 Fig . S5 , E – G ) . Finally , cells were able to recover normal actin array architecture from a 5 min , 339 10 µM CK - 666 application after a 30 - min wash out ( Supplemental Fig . S5 , H – J ) . 340 To further examine whether CK - 666 phenocopies arp2 / 3 mutants , we treated 5 - d - old 341 etiolated hypocotyls of wild type and arp2 - 1 with either DMSO ( mock ) solution or 10 μM CK - 666 342 for 5 min and measured actin organization and single filament dynamics . Compared to DMSO - 343 treated wild - type cells , the CK - 666 - treated wild - type cells had significantly decreased filament 344 abundance ( Fig . 4B ) , extent of filament bundling ( Fig . 4 , C and D ) , as well as overall nucleation 345 frequency ( Fig . 2B ) , and these changes mirrored actin organization in DMSO - treated arp2 - 1 346 cells . Moreover , treatment of arp2 - 1 with CK - 666 showed no differences in terms of filament 347 organization or dynamics compared to arp2 - 1 alone ( Fig . 3 and 4 ) . CK - 666 treatment also 348 potently suppressed side - branched filament nucleation in wild - type cells , but not end or de novo 349 filament origins ( Fig . 2 , C – E ; Supplemental Movies S1 and S8 ) , thereby fully phenocopying the 350 effects of arp2 - 1 . Finally , treatment of arp2 - 1 with CK - 666 did not further reduce filament side - 351 branch nucleation events , indicating that its likely mode of action is to inhibit daughter filament 352 12 formation from a mother filament by the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Fig . 2D ; Supplemental Movies S8 and 353 S9 ) . 354 When we compared the CK - 666 treatment of arpc2 with its wild - type siblings , there were 355 similar changes in actin architecture and filament nucleation frequency ( Supplemental Fig . S2 356 and S6 ) . Therefore , we validated CK - 666 as a small molecule inhibitor that targets the Arp2 / 3 357 complex and demonstrated its utility as an acute but reversible inhibitor for studying the Arp2 / 3 358 complex in Arabidopsis . 359 The Arp2 / 3 complex and formins are both capable of nucleating side - branched actin 360 filaments 361 Our previous work shows that profilin - bound actin monomers favor formin - mediated fast actin 362 filament elongation at rates > 2 µm / s ( Cao et al . , 2016 ) , and the data above suggest that 363 Arp2 / 3 - nucleated filament barbed ends elongated at intermediate rates of 1 . 25 – 1 . 5 µm / s ( Fig . 364 3B ; Supplemental Fig . S2B ) . We previously demonstrated the effectiveness of Small Molecule 365 Inhibitor of Formin Homology 2 ( SMIFH2 ) in Arabidopsis both in vivo and in vitro ( Cao et al . , 366 2016 ) . The actin array organization is altered and filament nucleation frequency is significantly 367 reduced when wild - type hypocotyl epidermal cells were treated with 25 μM SMIFH2 for 5 min 368 ( Cao et al . , 2016 ) , and similar results were obtained here ( Fig . 5 ; Fig . 6 , A and C – E ; 369 Supplemental Movie S10 ) . 370 To test whether the homeostatic actin filament array generated by these two nucleators 371 depends upon the Arp2 / 3 complex or formins , or both , we genetically and / or chemically inhibited 372 the Arp2 / 3 complex and formins . Both Arp2 / 3 - inhibited ( DMSO - treated arp2 - 1 or arpc2 ) or 373 formin - inhibited ( SMIFH2 - treated wild - type ) cells had a significant decrease in actin filament 374 abundance as well as in the extent of filament bundling compared to DMSO - treated wild type 375 ( Fig . 5 ; Supplemental Fig . S7 ) . Thus , both the Arp2 / 3 complex and formins are required to 376 generate dense arrays of individual actin filaments in the homeostatic actin cortex . To test 377 whether filament dynamics or the types and extent of filament nucleation are distinctly due to 378 the Arp2 / 3 complex or formins , we examined single filament dynamics in genetically - and / or 379 chemically - inhibited material . The nucleation frequency of both total and side - branching 380 filaments was significantly decreased in both Arp2 / 3 - inhibited ( DMSO - treated arp2 - 1 ) and 381 formin - inhibited ( SMIFH2 - treated wild - type ) cells compared to wild - type ( Fig . 6 , A and C – E ; 382 Supplemental Movies S2 and S10 ) , and the nucleation frequency of side - branched filaments in 383 Arp2 / 3 - inhibited cells ( 0 . 09 ± 0 . 01 events / filament / min ) was ~ 45 % less than in formin - inhibited 384 13 cells ( 0 . 16 ± 0 . 02 events / filament / min ; Fig . 6D ) . However , the nucleation frequency due to de 385 novo filament origins was not influenced when either the Arp2 / 3 complex or formin were 386 suppressed ( Fig . 6C ) . The average filament elongation rate in Arp2 / 3 - inhibited cells ( 1 . 89 ± 0 . 07 387 μm / s ) was also significantly higher than the rate in formin - inhibited cells ( 1 . 57 ± 0 . 06 μm / s ) or in 388 wild - type cells ( 1 . 79 ± 0 . 05 μm / s ) . In addition , the population distribution of filament elongation 389 rates in Arp2 / 3 - inhibited cells was significantly left - skewed ( peak value at 2 . 0 – 2 . 5 μm / s ) 390 compared to wild type ( peak value at 1 . 25 – 1 . 75 μm / s ) , whereas formin - inhibited cells lost a 391 large portion of filaments elongating at 2 . 0 – 2 . 5 μm / s but the distribution had a prominent peak 392 at 1 . 0 – 1 . 5 μm / s ( Fig . 6B ) . In addition , filaments in Arp2 / 3 - inhibited cells had a longer average 393 length compared to formin - inhibited cells ( Fig . 6 , F – H ) , but we did not observe any significant 394 difference in filament lifetime or severing frequency when parameters of side - branched 395 filaments in Arp2 / 3 - inhibited cells and formin - inhibited cells were compared ( Fig . 6 , I – N ) . Again , 396 we found similar results in both actin architecture ( Supplemental Fig . S7 ) and single filament 397 dynamics ( Supplemental Fig . S8 ) when arpc2 and its respective wild - type line treated with 398 DMSO solution or SMIFH2 were compared . These data indicated that both the Arp2 / 3 complex 399 and formin predominantly generate side - branched actin filaments and formin - nucleated 400 filaments elongate faster and longer than Arp2 / 3 - nucleated ones . 401 To test whether SMIFH2 exhibits off - target inhibition of myosin superfamily members , as 402 reported in Drosophila ( Nishimura et al . , 2021 ) , we evaluated the influence of SMIFH2 ( and CK - 403 666 ) on the activity of myosin XIK , the major myosin isoform mediating the delivery , vesicle 404 tethering , and exocytosis of secretory vesicles in Arabidopsis cells ( Zhang et al . , 2021 ) . We 405 found that neither SMIFH2 nor CK - 666 treatment reduced the speed of myosin XIK - YFP motility 406 compared to pentabromopseudilin ( PBP ) , an effective myosin inhibitor in plant cells 407 ( Supplemental Fig . S9 , D – F ) ( Zhang et al . , 2019 ) . In addition , we also measured filament 408 convolutedness and the rate of change of convolutedness of actin filaments , which are 409 parameters describing the buckling and straightening of filaments ( Staiger et al . , 2009 ; Cai et 410 al . , 2014 ) . Both parameters were significantly decreased after treatments with SMIFH2 or PBP , 411 but unchanged by CK - 666 , indicating that SMIFH2 does indeed alter filament buckling and 412 straightening ( Supplemental Fig . S9 , A – C ) . These data suggest that SMIFH2 may not have an 413 off - target effect on the activity of myosins XI based on the lack of effect on the motility of YFP - 414 XIK ; however , it is remains a formal possibilitythat SMIFH2 targets myosin isoforms other than 415 myosin XIK . Although the inhibition of filament buckling and straightening could indicate an off - 416 14 target effect of SMIFH2 on myosin XI , it seems equally likely that filament buckling is caused by 417 the processive assembly of actin filaments by Arabidopsis formins ( Supplemental Fig . S9 , A – C ) . 418 Simultaneous genetic and / or chemical inhibition of Arp2 / 3 and formins increases 419 spontaneous filament nucleation and overall actin filament abundance 420 To test whether two classes of nucleator cooperate to generate and maintain the homeostatic 421 actin cortical array in plant epidermal cells , we explored means to simultaneously suppress the 422 activity of both the Arp2 / 3 complex and formins and quantitatively evaluate the effects on actin 423 organization and dynamics . Specifically , using chemical and genetic tools to suppress the 424 activity of both the Arp2 / 3 complex and formins simultaneously , we applied SMIFH2 to arp2 - 1 or 425 arpc2 cells , treated wild - type cells with a combination of CK - 666 and SMIFH2 , and applied CK - 426 666 to the fh1 - 2 mutant . Since the Arp2 / 3 complex and formins are , so far , the only two actin 427 filament nucleators identified in plant cells , we predicted that simultaneously inhibiting the 428 Arp2 / 3 complex and formin would markedly suppress actin filament nucleation activities and 429 significantly reduce filament abundance . Surprisingly , in arp2 - 1 cells treated with SMIFH2 , the 430 actin filament abundance was significantly increased compared to cells with normal Arp2 / 3 431 complex and formin activities or with only one nucleator inhibited ( Fig . 5B ) . Notably , SMIFH2 - 432 treated arp2 - 1 cells exhibited a marked abundance of short , single actin filaments in the cortical 433 array ( Fig . 5A ) . Unlike actin array density , the extent of actin filament bundling was not restored 434 to wild - type levels when both the Arp2 / 3 complex and formins were simultaneously inhibited 435 ( Fig . 5 , C and D ) . In addition to increased filament abundance , total filament nucleation 436 frequency was significantly increased when both the Arp2 / 3 complex and formin activities were 437 reduced , and a 2 . 5 - fold enhancement of de novo filament origins was responsible for this 438 increase ( Fig . 6 , A and C – E ; Supplemental Movie S11 ) . However , the lengths of filaments 439 generated de novo or from the side - branching nucleation events were both significantly reduced 440 in SMIFH2 - treated arp2 - 1 cells compared to other treatments and genotypes ( Fig . 6 , F – H ) . 441 Similar results were obtained when arp2 - 1 epidermal cells from light - grown cotyledons were 442 treated with SMIFH2 ( Supplemental Fig . S4 ) , demonstrating that enhanced filament abundance 443 and a 2 . 5 - fold increase in de novo filament nucleation were not unique to etiolated hypocotyls . 444 Moreover , the findings were identical when GFP - LifeAct was used as the reporter instead of 445 GFP - fABD2 ( Supplemental Fig . S3 ) , indicating that the reporter plays little or no role in the 446 results obtained . Finally , we also observed similar phenotypes in both actin architecture and 447 filament dynamics when we applied SMIFH2 to arpc2 ( Supplemental Fig . S7 and S8 ) or 448 simultaneously applied CK - 666 and SMIFH2 to wild type ( Fig . 7 ) . These results indicate that a 449 15 marked increase in de novo filament nucleation results when both the Arp2 / 3 complex and 450 formins are inhibited in plant epidermal cells . 451 Beside the possible inhibition of myosin XI , another potential issue with using SMIFH2 452 as a formin inhibitor on plant cells is that Arabidopsis has 21 FORMIN homologs , and it remains 453 unclear whether SMIFH2 can inhibit all of them . To investigate the efficacy of SMIFH2 for 454 suppressing formin activity , as well as its ability to phenocopy the effects of plant formin 455 mutants , we prepared a homozygous AtFORMIN1 mutant line , fh1 - 2 , expressing GFP - fABD2 . 456 AtFORMIN1 is a major housekeeping formin homolog in Arabidopsis vegetative tissues 457 ( Cvrčková et al . , 2000 ; Blanchoin and Staiger , 2010 ; Rosero et al . , 2013 ; Rosero et al . , 2016 ) . 458 Previously , we demonstrated that SMIFH2 inhibits the nucleation and assembly activity of 459 recombinant FH2 domain from AtFORMIN1 in vitro ( Cao et al . , 2016 ) . Here , we found that the 460 density of actin filament arrays was significantly reduced but the extent of filament bundling was 461 higher in DMSO - treated fh1 - 2 cells compared to DMSO - treated wild - type ( Fig . 8 , A – D ) . The 462 nucleation frequency , specifically the side - branched filament subclass , was also significantly 463 decreased in DMSO - treated fh1 - 2 cells compared to DMSO - treated wild - type ( Fig . 8 , E – H ) . 464 SMIFH2 treatment caused an additional reduction in both actin filament abundance and 465 nucleation activity in fh1 - 2 cells ( Fig . 8 ) . These results suggest that SMIFH2 targets more formin 466 homologs than just AtFORMIN1 ; however , we cannot rule out the possibility that SMIFH2 does 467 not inhibit all formins . Consistent with previous biochemical results ( Michelot et al . , 2007 ) , these 468 findings provide genetic evidence that AtFORMIN1 is a filament nucleator that generates new 469 daughter filaments from the side of a mother filament or bundle . 470 To further test whether loss of a single formin homolog could recapitulate the effects of 471 SMIFH2 , we treated fh1 - 2 with CK - 666 or a combination of CK - 666 and SMIFH2 , as shown in 472 Figure 8 . Treatment of fh1 - 2 with CK - 666 led to a further significant reduction in filament density 473 ( Fig . 8B ) as well as side - branched nucleation frequency ( Fig . 8G ) , but no change in de novo 474 nucleation events ( Fig . 8F ) , compared to DMSO - treated fh1 - 2 . This does not resemble the dual 475 inhibition of wild - type with SMIFH2 and CK - 666 ( Fig . 7 ) , suggesting that loss of a single major 476 formin is not responsible for the phenotype . Further , we found that identical to wild - type cells 477 simultaneously treated with SMIFH2 and CK - 666 , fh1 - 2 responds to dual inhibition with 478 significantly increased filament abundance ( Fig . 8B ) as well as enhanced total ( Fig . 8E ) and de 479 novo nucleation frequency ( Fig . 8F ) . These results indicate that loss of AtFH1 does not play a 480 role in the rapid response to inhibition of two classes of nucleator in epidermal cells resulting in 481 enhanced filament formation through de novo nucleation . 482 16 PROFILIN1 does not play a role in the enhanced de novo nucleation in response to 483 simultaneous inhibition of two classes of nucleator 484 Profilins are actin monomer - binding proteins that suppress spontaneous nucleation , prevent 485 subunit addition onto filament pointed ends ( Cao et al . , 2016 ; Sun et al . , 2018 ) , and are 486 reportedly present at up to a 3 - fold molar excess to total actin protein in several plant tissues 487 ( Chaudhry et al . , 2007 ) . To test whether the enhanced de novo actin filament nucleation , when 488 the Arp2 / 3 complex and formins are both inhibited , was due to spontaneous nucleation , we 489 introduced a PROFILIN1 ( PRF1 ) mutant , prf1 - 2 , to suppress one of the major profilin homologs 490 in Arabidopsis vegetative tissues ( Sun et al . , 2018 ; Qiao et al . , 2019 ) . Consistent with our 491 previous findings ( Cao et al . , 2016 ) , prf1 - 2 had significantly reduced actin filament abundance 492 ( Fig . 9 , A and B ) , decreased total and side - branched nucleation ( Fig . 9 , E and G ) , but modestly 493 elevated de novo nucleation frequency ( Fig . 9F ) compared to mock - treated wild type . If the 494 enhanced de novo nucleation frequency following simultaneous inhibition of both nucleators is 495 due to the spontaneous nucleation resulting from increased free actin monomers , then we 496 expect that prf1 - 2 would be less responsive to these conditions as it presumably already has an 497 elevated free monomer concentration . We found that the triple inhibition of Arp2 / 3 , formins and 498 PRF1 caused a significantly increased actin density ( Fig . 9 , A and B ) , as well as enhanced total 499 and de novo nucleation frequency ( Fig . 9 , E – H ) , all of which were slightly elevated compared 500 with dual - inhibitor treated wild type . However , either CK - 666 or SMIFH2 single inhibitor 501 treatment on prf1 - 2 did not cause a 2 . 5 - fold higher de novo nucleation frequency ( Fig . 9E ) as 502 observed in dual - inhibitor treated prf1 - 2 cells . These results suggest that a change in free actin 503 monomer concentration or the function of PRF1 are not the cause of the elevated de novo 504 nucleation when both the Arp2 / 3 complex and formins are inhibited . 505 506 507 17 Discussion 508 In this study , we utilized a combination of genetic mutations or small molecule inhibitors along 509 with high spatiotemporal resolution fluorescence microscopy to demonstrate , for the first time , 510 that the Arp2 / 3 complex nucleates side - branched actin filaments in living Arabidopsis epidermal 511 cells . We found that the Arp2 / 3 complex mutants , arp2 - 1 and arpc2 , had a dramatically reduced 512 overall abundance of actin filaments in the cortical array , a reduction in the extent of filament 513 bundles , and a significantly decreased frequency of side - branched nucleation events . In 514 addition , acute treatment of wild - type plants with CK - 666 phenocopied the actin - based defects 515 observed in arp2 / 3 mutants , whereas applying CK - 666 to arp2 / 3 mutants did not have any 516 additional effect on overall actin structure or filament dynamics . Thus , we confirmed that these 517 actin - based defects correlated with the loss of functional Arp2 / 3 complex and established that 518 CK - 666 is an effective tool for inhibition of the Arp2 / 3 complex in plant cells . Through 519 experiments comparing genetic and chemical inhibition of the Arp2 / 3 complex or formins , we 520 observed that both proteins were capable of nucleating side - branched actin filaments , but that 521 Arp2 / 3 - nucleated filaments grew slower and were shorter than formin - nucleated ones . 522 Surprisingly , simultaneous inhibition of both the Arp2 / 3 complex and formins led to an increase 523 in actin filament abundance and dramatically promoted de novo nucleation events . By 524 examining the consequences of the loss of a major housekeeping profilin isoform , PRF1 , we 525 rule out the role of this monomer - binding protein in the enhanced de novo nucleation following 526 simultaneous inhibition of two classes of nucleator . These observations indicate that the 527 regulatory mechanisms for actin filament nucleation in the homeostatic cortical array of plant 528 cells may be unique and reveal a default response that maintains filament abundance and 529 dynamics when both nucleators are inactivated . 530 531 The Arp2 / 3 complex is a major nucleator of side - branched actin filaments in Arabidopsis 532 epidermal cells 533 Biochemical studies demonstrate that the Arp2 / 3 complex and formins use different molecular 534 mechanisms to overcome the rate - limiting step for filament formation , and they typically 535 generate different types of actin arrays . After creating an actin nucleus , the Arp2 / 3 complex 536 remains attached to the pointed end of the new filament so that the barbed end is free for the 537 addition of actin monomers , profilin - actin , or capping protein ( Mullins et al . , 1998 ; Amann and 538 Pollard , 2001 ; Fujiwara et al . , 2002 ; Ichetovkin et al . , 2002 ; Rouiller et al . , 2008 ) . In contrast , 539 18 many formins remain associated at the filament barbed end after the nucleation , and 540 processively facilitate filament elongation through the addition of profilin - actin . This allows 541 formin - associated filaments to grow much faster and longer compared to filaments with free 542 barbed ends that are typically bound by heterodimeric capping protein ( CP ) soon after initiation 543 ( Kovar and Pollard , 2004 ; Romero et al . , 2004 ; Kovar , 2006 ) . Based on these observations , the 544 conventional model of actin nucleation posits that formins generate long , unbranched filaments 545 with a fast filament elongation rate , whereas the Arp2 / 3 complex nucleates short , branched 546 actin networks with a slower growth rate . The Arp2 / 3 complex is accepted as a major nucleator 547 of side - branched actin filaments in yeast and animal cells ( Mullins et al . , 1998 ; Amann and 548 Pollard , 2001 ; Fujiwara et al . , 2002 ; Ichetovkin et al . , 2002 ; Rouiller et al . , 2008 ) . Even though 549 the Arp2 / 3 complex is also shown to be critical for plant cells to maintain their homeostatic actin 550 organization and is required for a wide variety of cellular activities , little is known about the exact 551 function of plant Arp2 / 3 complex in terms of its contribution to actin filament dynamics . 552 In this study , we characterized the function of the Arp2 / 3 complex in coordinating the 553 organization of the cortical actin array as well as single actin filament dynamics in living 554 Arabidopsis cells . Epidermal cells of etiolated hypocotyls , as well as light - grown cotyledons , with 555 genetically - or chemically - inhibited Arp2 / 3 complex showed a quantifiable decrease in both actin 556 filament abundance and extent of filament bundling , and , more importantly , there was a 557 significantly reduced nucleation frequency of side - branched actin filaments . Branched filament 558 formation represents more than half of all nucleation events in the cortical actin array of 559 hypocotyl or cotyledon epidermal cells , and these were reduced by 50 – 70 % when the Arp2 / 3 560 complex was inhibited chemically or genetically . These results suggest that the Arp2 / 3 complex 561 is a major nucleator of side - branched actin filaments in Arabidopsis epidermal cells . Our data 562 also provide a compelling live - cell view of the formation of branched actin filaments by active 563 Arp2 / 3 complex at single filament resolution . Furthermore , our results reveal that there are at 564 least two populations of filaments with different dynamic properties , likely due to different 565 filament growth mechanisms and / or the availability of filament barbed ends for monomer 566 addition , that contribute to the organization of the homeostatic actin cortical array in epidermal 567 cells . By examining filament elongation rate frequencies when formin activity was suppressed , 568 or when both the Arp2 / 3 complex and formins were inhibited , filaments with elongation rates of 569 1 – 1 . 25 µm / s predominated . We expect this represents the population of filaments with free 570 barbed ends extending by monomer addition and is consistent with the in - vitro mechanism of 571 branched filament nucleation by the Arp2 / 3 complex . 572 19 573 The Arp2 / 3 complex and formins both mediate side - branched filament nucleation but 574 generate filaments with unique dynamic properties 575 Nucleation is the rate - limiting step for actin filament formation in vitro and depends on the 576 availability of actin monomers and is suppressed by profilin ( Pollard et al . , 2000 ; Sept and 577 McCammon , 2001 ; Michelot et al . , 2005 ) . Previous results with the fission and budding yeasts , 578 Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Saccharomyces cerevisiae , as well as mammalian cells 579 reveal a competition between the Arp2 / 3 complex and formin for a limited pool of actin 580 monomers ; consequently , formin - mediated long filament bundles dominate when the Arp2 / 3 581 complex is inhibited , whereas an increased abundance of actin patches created by the Arp2 / 3 582 complex are prominent when formin is down - regulated ( Hotulainen and Lappalainen , 2006 ; 583 Burke et al . , 2014 ; Lomakin et al . , 2015 ; Suarez et al . , 2015 ; Fritzsche et al . , 2016 ; Davidson et 584 al . , 2018 ; Antkowiak et al . , 2019 ; Chan et al . , 2019 ; Kadzik et al . , 2020 ) . Plant cells , by contrast , 585 appear to show cooperation between these two nucleators rather than a competition to build 586 distinct actin arrays . The cortical cytoplasm of epidermal cells contains a dynamic actin array 587 that is rather disordered and comprises comingled actin filament bundles and individual actin 588 filaments ( Staiger et al . , 2009 ; Smertenko et al . , 2010 ) . Evidence for actin patches or dense 589 dendritic actin networks is limited to certain cell types , such as guard mother cells ( Facette et 590 al . , 2015 ) , the apex of trichomes ( Yanagisawa et al . , 2015 ) , or at focal sites elicited by pathogen 591 attack ( Hardham et al . , 2007 ; Qin et al . , 2021 ) . Our results revealed that the density of actin 592 filaments in the cortical array , the extent of filament bundling , as well as filament nucleation 593 frequency all decreased when either the Arp2 / 3 complex or formins were inhibited , suggesting 594 that the Arp2 / 3 complex or formins alone are not able to maintain the homeostasis of the cortical 595 actin arrays when the other nucleator is not functional . These results indicate that plant cells 596 may have a different actin regulatory mechanism for constructing actin filament arrays 597 compared to yeast or some animal cells . Our results are consistent with a previous report 598 showing partial cooperation between plant filament nucleation mechanisms in Arabidopsis 599 cotyledon epidermal cells , however , the consequences of losing either class of nucleator were 600 markedly different ( Cifrová et al . , 2020 ) . That study showed a minor increase in actin filament 601 density in either the formin fh1 mutant or the arpc5 mutant ( Cifrová et al . , 2020 ) , rather than the 602 prominent decreases observed here . As demonstrated here , these differences are not due to 603 the use of different actin filament reporters ( LifeAct versus fABD2 ) , different developmental state 604 and organ for examining epidermal cells ( cotyledons versus dark - grown hypocotyls ) , or the 605 20 result of compensation from genetic loss of one formin isoform versus acute treatment with a 606 chemical inhibitor . 607 Our results showed that both the Arp2 / 3 complex and formins , including AtFORMIN1 , 608 are responsible for generating side - branched filaments because the inhibition of either one led 609 to a significant reduction in side - branched filament nucleation and did not promote the other two 610 subclasses of filament nucleation . These results also suggest that the Arp2 / 3 complex and 611 formins are not competing for actin monomers for filament nucleation . Based on the total actin 612 concentration , the ratio of F - actin to total actin , and the ratio of profilin to total actin in other plant 613 tissues , the estimated actin monomer pool in Arabidopsis hypocotyl cells is relatively large and 614 most monomers are likely to be in a profilin - actin complex ( Chaudhry et al . , 2007 ; ( Staiger et al . , 615 2010 ) ; therefore , the Arp2 / 3 complex and formins may not have to compete for a limited supply 616 of actin monomers in plant cells . Here , if we assume that 1 . 25 µm / s is the rate of addition of 617 monomers to free barbed ends , that the association rate constant for plant actin is similar to 618 ATP - loaded rabbit skeletal muscle a - actin ( k + = 11 . 6 µM - 1 s - 1 ) and that a micron of actin filament 619 comprises 370 subunits ( Pollard et al . , 2000 ) , then we estimate the available monomer pool to 620 be 40 µM in hypocotyl epidermal cells using the equation : [ G - actin ] = rate / k + . In addition , even 621 though both the Arp2 / 3 complex and formins generate side - branched actin filaments , these 622 filaments have markedly different properties . We found that formin - nucleated filaments grew 623 significantly faster at rates of 2 – 2 . 25 µm / s , with another small subpopulation growing at rates > 624 3 µm / s . The different properties of filament barbed ends as well as a large pool of monomers , 625 perhaps buffered with profilin , may facilitate the fast - growing filaments nucleated by side - 626 branching as previously found in Arabidopsis cells ( Cao et al . , 2016 ) , and is consistent with 627 previous in vitro results ( Vavylonis et al . , 2006 ; Michelot et al . , 2013 ; Suarez et al . , 2015 ; Zhang 628 et al . , 2016 ; Funk et al . , 2019 ) . 629 If using the conventional model for how formins generate new actin filaments , we would 630 predict that plant processive formins not only generate growing filaments from the side of a 631 mother filament but also remain attached to the barbed end of the new filament to facilitate the 632 addition of profilin - actin to the growing ends , resulting in faster and longer side - branched 633 filaments compared to Arp2 / 3 - nucleated ones . However , previous in vitro data showed that the 634 AtFORMIN1 nucleates actin filaments but remains associated at the pointed end and does not 635 compete with capping protein for filament barbed ends , indicating it is non - processive and 636 associates with the side of filaments after nucleation ( Michelot et al . , 2006 ) . Further , SMIFH2 637 21 application in our studies reduced nucleation frequency but did not reduce the filament length of 638 side - branched filaments compared to the mock treatment . Both in vitro and in vivo results 639 suggest that non - processive formins in plant cells may have a weak interaction with filament 640 barbed ends so that these formins move away from the end of the filament to its side to 641 generate a new side - branched filament instead of occupying the barbed end and facilitating 642 filament elongation . However , another in vitro analysis showed that the processive formin , 643 AtFORMIN14 , promotes de novo filament growth via the association with profilin ( Zhang et al . , 644 2016 ) , and there are 21 FORMIN homologs in Arabidopsis ( Cvrčková et al . , 2004 ; Blanchoin 645 and Michelot , 2012 ; Cvrčková , 2013 ) . All these results suggest that plant formins that nucleate 646 side - branched filaments may have distinct molecular properties compared to formins that 647 nucleate de novo filament formation or formins found in yeast or animal cells . With the exception 648 of enhanced bundling , the loss of a single formin isoform , fh1 - 2 , recapitulates but is less 649 dramatic than the effects of SMIFH2 treatment of epidermal cells supporting the conclusion that 650 multiple formin isoforms are likely inhibited by this small molecule . 651 Since SMIFH2 shows off - target inhibition of members of the myosin superfamily 652 ( Nishimura et al . , 2021 ) , we were compelled to critically evaluate the effects of SMIFH2 653 treatment on plant cells . Although our data showed that SMIFH2 treatment did not influence the 654 motility of myosin XIK , it did significantly reduce filament convolutedness and the rate of change 655 of convolutedness of actin filaments , suggesting that SMIFH2 alters filament buckling and 656 straightening . However , the change in filament buckling could be the consequence of different 657 filament growth rates and processive elongation by formins ( Staiger et al . , 2009 ; Cai et al . , 658 2014 ; Cao et al . , 2016 ) . Even though a recent in vitro study reveals that SMIFH2 is a pan - 659 inhibitor for all human formins ( Orman et al . , 2022 ) , we should not exclude the possibility that 660 SMIFH2 can only inhibit a subset of plant formin homologs . Further genetic and biochemical 661 analyses should be designed to dissect the interaction between SMIFH2 and different formin 662 homologs to determine the specificity of this chemical inhibitor on plant formins . 663 664 Simultaneous inhibition of the Arp2 / 3 complex and formins promotes de novo nucleation 665 events 666 When we combined genetic and chemical methods to downregulate the Arp2 / 3 complex and 667 formins simultaneously , surprisingly , the frequency of actin filament nucleation was significantly 668 enhanced by up to 2 . 5 - fold , with de novo nucleation events appearing to be the exclusive 669 contributor to this enhancement . The Arp2 / 3 complex and formins are , to date , the only two 670 22 bona fide actin filament nucleators in plant cells ( Blanchoin and Staiger , 2010 ; Vaškovičová et 671 al . , 2013 ; Yanagisawa et al . , 2013 ) . Theoretically , when both the Arp2 / 3 complex and formins 672 are inhibited , the concentration of free actin monomers is predicted to increase but the ratio of 673 F - to G - actin and the proportion of profilin - actin in the monomer pool should both decrease . It is 674 possible that these changes in the actin monomer pool could increase the nucleation rate of 675 spontaneous filament formation thereby enhancing the total frequency of de novo nucleation 676 events . In support of this model , disruption of AtPRF1 led to a modest increase in de novo 677 nucleation events and a decrease in side - branched events ( Cao et al . , 2016 ) . However , the 678 prf1 - 2 mutant exhibits a 2 . 5 - fold increase in de novo nucleation frequency , just like wild - type 679 epidermal cells , when both nucleators are inhibited with chemicals . Perhaps , as suggested by 680 Sun et al . ( 2018 ) , another profilin isoform , PRF3 , is the major regulator of spontaneous filament 681 nucleation and sequesters actin monomers that are poorly utilized by formins . The acute 682 chemical inhibition of nucleation machinery could lead to rapid post - translational modification 683 and inactivation of PRF3 , thereby facilitating spontaneous filament formation from free 684 monomers . This hypothesis needs to be tested through future experiments . 685 In conclusion , our results provide direct evidence to demonstrate that the Arp2 / 3 686 complex nucleates side - branched actin filaments in living plant cells . These studies also confirm 687 that some formin isoforms , including AtFORMIN1 , generate side - branched actin filaments in 688 plant cells , which is a unique actin filament nucleation mechanism compared to yeast or animal 689 cells . Moreover , we find that Arp2 / 3 - and formin - nucleated filaments have distinct dynamic 690 properties , which can be applied to future studies about how cells coordinate these two 691 nucleators to regulate the actin structure and dynamics for different cellular activities . The 692 simultaneous inhibition of both the Arp2 / 3 complex and formin surprisingly caused an enhanced 693 de novo filament nucleation , which raises the possibility for a unique actin nucleation 694 mechanism to generate dynamic cortical actin arrays in plant cells . 695 696 23 Materials and methods 697 Plant materials and growth conditions 698 All Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana ) plants in this study were in Columbia - 0 ( Col - 0 ) 699 background . The ARP2 T - DNA insertion line , arp2 - 1 ( SALK _ 003448 ) , the PRF1 T - DNA 700 insertion line , prf1 - 2 ( SALK _ 057718 ; Cao et al . , 2016 ) , and the AtFORMIN1 T - DNA insertion 701 line , fh1 - 2 ( SALK _ 009693 ; Rosero et al . , 2013 ) were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological 702 Resource Center ( Ohio State University ) . The ARPC2 point mutation line , arpc2 ( G1217A ) , was 703 kindly provided by Dan Szymanski ( Purdue University ) . Mutant lines , arp2 - 1 , arpc2 and prf1 - 2 , 704 were crossed to wild - type ( Col - 0 ) expressing the GFP - fABD2 reporter ( Sheahan et al . , 2004 ; 705 Staiger et al . , 2009 ) and homozygous mutants and corresponding wild - type siblings were 706 recovered from F2 populations . For the fh1 - 2 line , homozygous plants were transformed with a 707 35S : : GFP - fABD2 construct using the floral dip method and seeds were screened with 708 kanamycin ( Clough and Bent , 1998 ; Sheahan et al . , 2004 ) . For lines carry GFP - LifeAct , both 709 Col - 0 and arp2 - 1 mutant were transformed with a UBQ : : GFP - LifeAct construct ( kindly provided 710 by Weibing Yang from The Sainsbury Laboratory , University of Cambridge , Cambridge , UK ) 711 using the floral dip method and transformants selected with BASTA ( Clough and Bent , 1998 ) . 712 Seeds were surface sterilized and stratified at 4°C for 3 days on plates comprising half - 713 strength Murashige and Skoog ( MS ) medium supplemented with 1 % ( w / v ) sucrose and 1 % 714 ( w / v ) agar . For dark - grown hypocotyl growth , seedlings were grown in continuous darkness 715 after exposing the plates to light for 4 h . For light - grown root and cotyledon growth , seeds were 716 grown vertically on plates comprising half - strength MS medium supplemented with 0 % ( w / v ) 717 sucrose and 0 . 6 % ( w / v ) agar under long - day conditions ( 16 h light / 8h dark ) at 21°C . 718 Drug treatments 719 For short - term live cell treatments , individual seedlings were treated for 5 min in inhibitor 720 solution in 6 - well plates in the dark prior to each imaging session . Hypocotyls were mounted in 721 the inhibitor solution and imaged immediately . CK - 666 ( Sigma - Aldrich ; Cat # 182515 ; St . Louis , 722 MO , USA ) , SMIFH2 ( Sigma - Aldrich ; Cat # 344092 ) and PBP ( Adipogen ; Cat # BVT - 0441 ) were 723 dissolved in DMSO to prepare a 5 mM stock solution . 724 Live cell imaging 725 24 For both snapshot and time - lapse image acquisitions in dark grown hypocotyls , epidermal cells 726 from the apical region of 5 - d - old dark - grown hypocotyls were used . In some experiments , the 727 lipophilic dye , FM4 - 64 ( Invitrogen ; Cat # T3166 ; Carlsbad , CA , USA ) , was dissolved in DMSO 728 and used at 20 mM to label the plasma membrane . All images and movies were collected using 729 variable - angle epifluorescence microscopy ( VAEM ) with an Olympus TIRF objective ( 60X , 1 . 45 730 numerical aperture ) using SlideBook software ( version 5 . 5 ; Intelligent Imaging Innovations ) as 731 described previously ( Staiger et al . , 2009 ; Henty et al . , 2011 ; Li et al . , 2012 ; Cai et al . , 2014 ; 732 Cao et al . , 2016 ) . 733 For experiments with cotyledons , adaxial epidermal cells from 5 - d - old light - grown 734 cotyledons were used . An Olympus IX - 83 microscope mounted with a spinning - disc confocal 735 unit ( Yokogawa CSUX1 - A1 ) and an Andor iXon Ultra 897BV EMCCD camera were used to 736 acquire snapshot and time - lapse images with an Olympus UPlanSApo oil objective ( 100X , 1 . 45 737 numerical aperture ) . GFP fluorescence was excited with a 488nm laser line and emission 738 collected through the 525 / 30 nm filter to visualize actin filaments . All images were collected with 739 MetaMorph software ( version 7 . 8 . 8 . 0 ) as described previously ( Cao et al . , 2022 ) . 740 A double - blinded experimental design was used for all image collection , processing and 741 quantitative analyses . 742 Image processing and quantitative analysis of actin cytoskeleton architecture and single 743 actin filament dynamics 744 Images and movies were processed with Fiji is Just Image J ( Schindelin et al . , 2012 ) . All images 745 used for actin architecture analysis were collected with a fixed exposure time , laser power , and 746 camera gain setting . 747 To quantify actin architecture , three parameters , density , skewness and coefficient of 748 variation ( CV ) , were employed in this study ; density measures the percentage of occupancy of 749 GFP signal in an image and skewness and CV measure the extent of actin filament 750 bundling ( Higaki et al . , 2010 ; Ueda et al . , 2010 ; Henty et al . , 2011 ; Li et al . , 2012 ; Cai et al . , 751 2014 ; Cao et al . , 2016 ; Arieti and Staiger , 2020 ) . Micrographs were analyzed in Fiji Is Just 752 Image J using the methods described previously ( Higaki et al . , 2010 ; Henty et al . , 2011 ; Li et al . , 753 2012 ; Higaki et al . , 2020 ) . 754 25 To compare single actin filament parameters between genotype or drug treatment , 755 double - blind experiments ( data collection and analysis ) were performed . Maximum filament 756 length and lifetime , filament severing frequency , elongation rates , filament convolutedness and 757 the rate of change of convolutedness were measured as described previously ( Staiger et al . , 758 2009 ; Henty et al . , 2011 ; Li et al . , 2012 ; Cai et al . , 2014 ; Cao et al . , 2016 ) . For nucleation 759 frequency analysis , a 400 µm 2 ROI was randomly selected from movies of epidermal cells at the 760 apical region of the hypocotyl , and all observable nucleation events were counted during a time 761 period of 100 s , according to Cao et al . , 2016 . To account for differences in filament density in 762 genotypes or drug treatments , the nucleation frequency was normalized against filament 763 numbers in each ROI . 764 For actin architecture analysis in both hypocotyl and cotyledon epidermal cells , more 765 than 150 ROIs were selected from 50 images of cells collected from at least 10 individual 766 seedlings per genotype or treatment . For nucleation frequency analysis , more than 300 events 767 from at least 10 individual seedlings were observed per genotype or treatment . For single actin 768 filament dynamics analysis , at least 5 newly - appeared filaments were tracked from their first 769 appearance to their complete disappearance in each hypocotyl , and more than 50 filaments 770 from at least 10 hypocotyls were measured per genotype or treatment . For all statistical 771 comparisons and plotting , the average value from a single hypocotyl was used as one data 772 point . All experiments were conducted with at least 2 independent biological repeats to make 773 conclusions in each figure . 774 Statistical analyses 775 Two - way ANOVA with Tukey’s post - hoc tests were performed in SPSS ( version 25 ) to 776 determine the significance among different genotypes / treatments . Chi - square tests were 777 performed for statistically comparing parametric distributions and P values were calculated in 778 Excel 15 . 32 . Any difference with a P value less than 0 . 05 was considered significantly different . 779 Detailed statistical analysis data are shown in Supplemental Data Set 1 . 780 26 Supplemental data 781 The following materials are available in the online version of this article . 782 Supplemental Table S1 .
