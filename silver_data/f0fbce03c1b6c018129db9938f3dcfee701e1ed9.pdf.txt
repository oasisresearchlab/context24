Platelets respond to various stimuli with rapid changes in shape followed by aggregation and se - cretion of their granule contents . Platelets lacking the (cid:97) - subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein G q do not ag - gregate and degranulate but still undergo shape change after activation through thromboxane - A 2 ( TXA 2 ) or thrombin receptors . In contrast to thrombin , the TXA 2 mimetic U46619 led to the selective activation of G 12 and G 13 in G (cid:97) q - deficient platelets indicating that these G proteins mediate TXA 2 receptor - induced shape change . TXA 2 receptor - mediated activation of G 12 / G 13 resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of pp72 syk and stimulation of pp60 c - src as well as in phosphorylation of myosin light chain ( MLC ) in G (cid:97) q - deficient platelets . Both MLC phosphorylation and shape change induced through G 12 / G 13 in the absence of G (cid:97) q were inhibited by the C3 exoenzyme from Clostridium botulinum , by the Rho - kinase inhibitor Y - 27632 and by cAMP - ana - logue Sp - 5 , 6 - DCl - cBIMPS . These data indicate that G 12 / G 13 couple receptors to tyrosine kinases as well as to the Rho / Rho - kinase—mediated regulation of MLC phosphorylation . We provide evidence that G 12 / G 13 - mediated Rho / Rho - kinase—dependent regulation of MLC phosphorylation participates in receptor - induced platelet shape change . Key words : platelet ¥ platelet shape change ¥ G pro - tein ¥ Rho - kinase ¥ myosin light chain phosphorylation T HE functional responses of platelets to various full platelet activators are well characterized and in - clude secretion of granular contents , platelet aggre - gation , and platelet shape change . Platelets are discoid in their resting state and upon activation by most stimuli rap - idly change into a spheroid shape and extrude pseudopo - dia . This shape change is one of the earliest effects detect - able in response to various platelet stimuli . Platelet shape change is believed to be a prerequisite for full platelet acti - vation including degranulation and aggregation . The acti - vation of platelets is responsible for primary hemostasis and underlies various pathological situations such as un - stable angina pectoris , myocardial infarction , or cerebro - vascular diseases . Platelet shape change results from a rapid reorganiza - tion of the cytoskeleton including formation of new actin filaments , disappearance of the marginal band of microtu - bules , and centralization of granules ( Siess , 1989 ; Wur - zinger , 1990 ; Fox , 1993 ; Morgenstern , 1997 ) . Signal trans - duction mechanisms regulating platelet shape change are ill defined . An involvement of tyrosine phosphorylation events , myosin light chain phosphorylation and polyphos - phoinositide - induced actin polymerization have been sug - gested ( Daniel et al . , 1984 ; Hartwig et al . , 1995 ; Negrescu et al . , 1995 ; Maeda et al . , 1995 ) . Several reports have dem - onstrated that , in contrast to full platelet activation , induc - tion of platelet shape change does not require elevation of the free cytosolic Ca 2 (cid:49) concentration ( Rink et al . , 1982 ; Simpson et al . , 1986 ; Ohkubo et al . , 1996 ) . Consistent with that , we recently demonstrated that incubation of G (cid:97) q - deficient platelets with various stimuli failed to induce phospholipase C activation and [ Ca 2 (cid:49) ] i elevation as well as aggregation and degranulation . Platelet shape change , however , could still be elicited ( Offermanns et al . , 1997b ) . Platelets do not contain G (cid:97) 11 , a close homologue of G (cid:97) q ( Milligan et al . , 1993 ; Johnson et al . , 1996 ; Offermanns et al . , 1997b ) . The effect of full platelet stimuli like thromboxane A 2 ( TXA 2 ) 1 and thrombin are mediated through G protein— Address correspondence to S .

G proteins are heterotrimers which are defined by their (cid:97) - subunits . According to structural and functional similarities , G pro - tein (cid:97) - subunits are grouped into four families , G (cid:97) q , G (cid:97) i , G (cid:97) 12 , and G (cid:97) s ( Simon et al . , 1991 ) . Although G q - mediated activation of phospholipase C (cid:98) - isoforms appears to play a central and essential role in agonist - induced platelet ag - gregation and secretion , G i - type G proteins are involved in the inhibitory regulation of platelet adenylyl cyclase ( Brass et al . , 1997 , 1988 ; Offermanns et al . , 1997b ) . The role of the G 12 family members , G 12 and G 13 , in the regula - tion of platelet function is unclear . The (cid:97) - subunits of both G proteins appear to be involved in the regulation of cell growth and cell movement ( Dhanasekaran and Dermott , 1996 ; Offermanns et al . , 1997a ) . Since G 12 / G 13 - coupled re - ceptors appear to also activate G q family members it has been difficult to selectively study the cellular signaling processes regulated by receptor - mediated activation of G 12 / G 13 . Most knowledge about the signaling pathways in - fluenced by G 12 / G 13 results from the use of constitutively active forms of G (cid:97) 12 and G (cid:97) 13 . Either mutant has been shown to cause Na (cid:49) / H (cid:49) exchanger activation , stimulation of phospholipase D , cell transformation , and formation of actin stress fibers through the small molecular weight GTP - ase Rho ( Buhl et al . , 1995 ; Hooley et al . , 1996 ; Fromm et al . , 1997 ; Plonk et al . , 1998 ) . The effector directly regulated by G (cid:97) 12 and G (cid:97) 13 has been elusive . However , the guanine nu - cleotide exchange factor ( GEF ) for Rho , p115RhoGEF , has been shown to interact with G (cid:97) 12 and G (cid:97) 13 and repre - sents a candidate effector ( Kozasa et al . , 1998 ; Hart et al . , 1998 ) . To study the possible role of G 12 / G 13 in the platelet shape change response we took advantage of platelets from G (cid:97) q - deficient mice . In this report , we demonstrate that selective activation of G 12 / G 13 is sufficient to induce the platelet shape change reaction , and we provide evi - dence that this involves Rho / Rho - kinase—mediated phos - phorylation of the myosin light chain .

Aktories ( both from University of Freiburg , Freiburg , Germany ) or was purchased from Upstate Biotech - nologies , anti - pp72 syk antibodies as well as anti - phosphotyrosine antibod - ies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology , and anti - pp60 v - src antibodies were from Oncogene . Antisera against G protein (cid:97) - subunits have been described ( Offermanns et al . , 1994 ; Laugwitz et al . , 1994 ) . Platelet Preparation and Aggregation Whole blood was collected from normal and G (cid:97) q - deficient mice anesthe - tized with pentobarbital by puncturing the inferior vena cava with hep - arinized syringes at a final concentration of 25 U heparin / ml blood . The blood from three or four G (cid:97) q - deficient mice and wild - type mice was pooled for each platelet aggregation experiment . Blood was diluted with half the volume of Hepes - Tyrode - buffer ( 134 mM NaCl , 0 . 34 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 2 . 9 mM KCl , 12 mM NaHCO 3 , 20 mM Hepes , 5 mM glucose , 1 mM MgCl 2 , pH 7 . 3 ) , and platelet rich plasma ( PRP ) was obtained by centrifugation for 7 . 5 min at 250 g . Thereafter , prostacyclin at a final con - centration of 300 nM was added to the PRP , and platelets were pelleted by centrifugation at 1 , 200 g for 5 min . The platelet pellet was resuspended in Hepes - Tyrode buffer and incubated for 30 min at 37 (cid:56) C . Platelet suspen - sion was adjusted to 300 , 000 platelets per microliter with Hepes - Tyrode buffer . Optical aggregation experiments were conducted in a four - channel aggregometer ( model Aggrecorder II PA - 3220 ; Kyoto Daiichi Kagaku ) . Preincubation in Hepes - Tyrode buffer without and with cGMP and cAMP analogues and Y - 27632 was performed for 20 min at room temper - ature . Immediately before the aggregation experiments , platelets were preincubated for 1 min at 37 (cid:56) C in Hepes - Tyrode buffer containing 1 mM CaCl 2 . Photolabeling of Membrane Proteins and Immunoprecipitation of G (cid:97) - subunits Platelet membranes were prepared and photolabeled as described ( Offer - manns et al . , 1994 ) . In brief , cell membranes ( 50—100 (cid:109) g of protein per as - say tube ) were incubated at 30 (cid:56) C in a buffer containing 0 . 1 mM EDTA , 10 mM MgCl 2 , 30 mM NaCl , 1 mM benzamidine , and 50 mM Hepes - NaOH , pH 7 . 4 . After 3 min of preincubation in the absence and presence of receptor agonist , samples were incubated for another 15 min with 10—20 nM [ (cid:97) - 32 P ] GTP azidoanilide ( 130 kBq per tube ) . [ (cid:97) - 32 P ] GTP azidoanilide was synthesized and purified as described ( Offermanns et al . , 1991 ) . For photolabeling of G i (cid:97) - subunits , 5 (cid:109) M GDP was present in the incubation buffer . Samples were washed , dissolved in labeling buffer , and then irradi - ated as described ( Offermanns et al . , 1994 ) . Photolabeled membranes were pelleted and proteins were predenatured in SDS . Solubilized mem - branes were preabsorbed with protein A—Sepharose beads , and immuno - precipitation was done as described ( Laugwitz et al . , 1994 ) . SDS - PAGE and Immunoblotting SDS - PAGE of photolabeled proteins was performed on 10 % ( wt / vol ) acrylamide gels . Photolabeled membrane proteins were visualized by au - toradiography of the dried gels . Blotting of membrane proteins separated by SDS - PAGE , processing of immunoblots , and detection of immunore - active proteins by chemiluminescence procedure ( Amersham ) has been described ( Laugwitz et al . , 1994 ) . Determination of Cellular cAMP Levels Platelets ( 10 8 per tube ) were preincubated for 15 min with 300 (cid:109) M 3 - iso - butyl - 1 - methylxanthine and 20 (cid:109) M 4 - ( 3 - butoxy - 4 - methoxybenzyl ) - 2 - imid - azolidinone ( Ro 20 - 1724 ) and incubated for 20 min in the absence and presence of receptor agonists . The reaction was stopped by the addition of 300 (cid:109) l of ice - cold 10 % ( wt / vol ) trichloracetic acid . Samples were kept for 10 min on ice , and 180 (cid:109) l of 1 M Tris , pH 9 . 8 , was added to neutralize the sample . Cyclic AMP was determined by the competitive - binding assay ( Gilman and Murad , 1974 ) . In brief , samples were incubated for 2 h with 2 pmol of [ 8 - 3 H ] cAMP ( 925 Gbq / mmol ; Amersham ) and 62 . 5 (cid:109) g of cAMP - dependent protein kinase purified from porcine heart ( Sigma ) in a final volume of 200 (cid:109) l at 4 (cid:56) C . Then , 4 % ( wt / vol ) charcoal in 5 mM EDTA and 50 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 5 , was added , and samples were immediately cen - trifuged for 2 min at 12 , 000 g . Supernatants were counted in a liquid scin - tillation counter , and the amount of cAMP in the test sample was calcu - lated as described ( Gilman and Murad , 1974 ) . Determination of Tyrosine Phosphorylation Isolated platelets ( 1—2 (cid:51) 10 7 platelets per tube ) were incubated in 40 (cid:109) l Hepes - Tyrode buffer at 37 (cid:56) C as indicated . Reactions were stopped by ad - dition of 20 (cid:109) l of 3 (cid:51) sample buffer containing a final concentration of 1 mM Na 3 VO 4 . Heated samples were separated by SDS - PAGE on 10 % gels . Immunoblotted proteins were analyzed for phosphotyrosine with an antiphosphotyrosine antibody . Immunoprecipitation and Immune Complex Kinase Assay For immunoprecipitation of tyrosine kinases pp72 syk and pp60 c - src , platelet suspensions ( 0 . 4—1 (cid:51) 10 9 platelets ) were incubated in the absence or pres - ence of 5 (cid:109) M U46619 for the indicated time periods , and platelets were on S ep t e m be r 2 , 2017 j c b . r up r e ss . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m Klages et al .

After incubation for 20 min on ice , samples were centrifuged for 20 min at 15 , 000 g at 4 (cid:56) C , and incubated with 5 (cid:109) g agarose conjugates of rabbit poly - clonal anti - pp72 syk IgG or 8 (cid:109) l of agarose - conjugated mouse monoclonal anti - pp60 v - src IgG 1 for 2 h at 4 (cid:56) C . Immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation at 15 , 000 g for 10 min at 4 (cid:56) C and were washed twice with 1 (cid:51) RIPA buffer , once with 1 % Triton X - 100 , 0 . 3 % SDS , 600 mM NaCl , and 50 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 4 , and once with 300 mM NaCl , 10 mM EDTA , 100 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 4 . For detection of pp72 syk phosphoryla - tion , precipitated proteins were eluted with 40 (cid:109) l of 1 (cid:51) SDS sample buffer and separated by 10 % polyacrylamide gels . Tyrosine phosphoryla - tion of pp72 syk and pp72 syk protein were analyzed by immunoblotting . The anti - pp60 c - src immunoprecipitates were divided into two aliquots ; one was analyzed by anti - pp60 c - src immunoblotting , and the other was subjected to in vitro kinase assay . To examine in vitro kinase activity , precipitates were incubated for 5 min at 25 (cid:56) C in kinase buffer containing 25 mM Hepes / NaOH , pH 7 . 4 , 10 mM MnCl 2 , 1 (cid:109) M ATP ( 7 (cid:109) Ci of [ (cid:103) - 32 P ] ATP / tube ) , and 0 . 25 mg / ml histone . Reaction was terminated by addition of 2 (cid:51) sample buffer , and samples were subjected to SDS - PAGE . Phosphorylation of histone was analyzed by autoradiography of dried gels . Scanning Electron Microscopy Isolated platelets were preincubated under the indicated conditions . Thereafter , platelets were incubated in the absence or presence of 1 U / ml thrombin or 5 (cid:109) M U46619 for 5 s at 37 (cid:56) C and then fixed for 10 min with 3 % paraformaldehyde , 3 . 75 % glutaraldehyde , 0 . 06 mM cacodylate buffer , and 3 . 4 mM CaCl 2 . The fixed platelets were suction filtered onto polycar - bonate filters ( 0 . 45 (cid:109) m ; Nucleopore ) which had been preincubated with 10 (cid:109) g / ml polylysine . Filters were washed three times with 0 . 9 % NaCl and dehydrated stepwise in aqueous ethanol . After exchange of ethanol for hexadimethyldisilazane , samples were air - dried and sputtered with gold . Scanning electron microscopy was carried out on a Zeiss - Gemini instru - ment using a beam voltage of 5 kV . MLC Phosphorylation MLC phosphorylation was determined as described ( Daniel and Sellers , 1992 ) . Isolated platelets ( 1—2 (cid:51) 10 7 platelets per tube ) were incubated in 30 (cid:109) l Hepes - Tyrode buffer at 37 (cid:56) C as indicated . Reactions were stopped by addition of 30 (cid:109) l of 40 % ( vol / vol ) perchloric acid . Precipitated samples were kept on ice for 20—30 min . After centrifugation ( 10 min at 15 , 000 g at 4 (cid:56) C ) pellets were washed twice with acetone containing 10 mM DTT . 30 (cid:109) l of SDS sample buffer was added to dried samples , and proteins were solu - bilized by sonication for 30 min . Separation of proteins on urea / glycin gels was done as described ( Daniel and Sellers , 1992 ) , and MLC was detected after immunoblotting with an anti - MLC antibody . Determination of F - actin Content For actin filament content measurements , platelets ( 10 8 ) were incubated as indicated and fixed in 2 % paraformaldehyde for 30 min at 37 (cid:56) C . Fixed platelets were permeabilized with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 , incubated with 10 (cid:109) M fluorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) - phalloidin ( Sigma ) for 30 min at room temperature and were then washed . Bound FITC - phalloidin was quanti - fied using a fluorescence spectrophotometer ( Perkin - Elmer ) ( excitation at 495 nm ; emission at 519 nm ) . ADP Ribosylation of Platelet Lysates by C3 Exoenzyme Washed platelets were incubated with the indicated concentrations of C3 exoenzyme in Hepes - Tyrode buffer . Platelets were lysed by addition of an equal volume of lysis buffer ( 1 . 5 % Triton X - 100 , 0 . 8 % DOC , 0 . 2 % SDS , 145 mM NaCl , 20 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 4 , 3 mM EGTA , 0 . 3 mM phenylmeth - ylsulfonyl fluoride , 5 (cid:109) M leupeptin , 5 (cid:109) g / ml aprotinin ) . ADP - ribosylation using [ 32 P ] NAD was performed as described ( Morii et al . , 1992 ) , and ribo - sylated samples were separated on 12 % polyacrylamide gels . Results We have recently shown that G (cid:97) q - deficient platelets do not aggregate and secrete their granule contents in re - sponse to various stimuli indicating that G q - mediated acti - vation of phospholipase C represents the central early sig - nal transduction process leading to full platelet activation . However , G q - deficient platelets were still able to undergo ligand - induced platelet shape change . This suggests that G proteins other than G q mediate the platelet shape change response . Shape change induced by the TXA 2 analogue U46619 could be observed in G (cid:97) q - deficient platelets by scanning electron microscopy of single cells ( Fig . 1 , A—D ) Figure 1 . Scanning electron microscopy of inactivated and activated wild - type and G (cid:97) q - deficient platelets . Wild - type plate - lets ( A , B , E , F , I , and J ) and G (cid:97) q - defi - cient platelets ( C , D , G , H , K , and L ) were preincubated for 30 min in the absence ( A—D ) or presence of 10 (cid:109) M Y - 27632 ( E—H ) or were pretreated for 2 h with 50 (cid:109) g / ml C3 exoenzyme ( I—L ) . Thereafter , platelets were incubated for 5 s in the ab - sence ( A , C , E , G , I , and K ) and presence of 5 (cid:109) M U46619 ( B , D , F , H , J , and L ) , fixed , and then analyzed as described in Materials and Methods . Platelets incubated for 2 h in C3 - exoenzyme buffer alone showed normal shape change in response to U46619 ( data not shown ) .

Shape change induced by U46619 in G (cid:97) q - deficient platelets and wild - type platelets was blocked by the cAMP analogue Sp - 5 , 6 - DCl - cBIMPS but not by the cGMP analogue 8 - pCPT - cGMP , whereas both cyclic nu - cleotides blocked aggregation in wild - type platelets ( Fig . 2 , A and B ) . Similar results were observed with thrombin - activated wild - type and G (cid:97) q - deficient platelets ( data not shown ) . Preincubation of platelets with the recently de - scribed Rho - kinase inhibitor Y - 27632 ( Uehata et al . , 1997 ) blocked U46619 - induced shape change both in wild - type and G (cid:97) q - deficient platelets ( Fig . 1 , E—H and Fig . 2 , C and D ) . To assess the role of Rho in agonist - induced plate - let shape change we preincubated platelets for 2 h with 50 (cid:109) g / ml C3 exoenzyme which ADP ribosylates and inac - tivates the small GTPase Rho ( Morii et al . , 1992 ) . This C3 exoenzyme concentration and preincubation time resulted in ADP - ribosylation of 70—75 % of endogenous Rho as de - termined by the inability of C3 exoenzyme to [ 32 P ] ADP - ribosylate Rho in subsequently prepared cell lysates ( Fig . 3 ) . Longer preincubation times and higher C3 exoen - zyme concentrations further increased the ADP - ribosy - lated fraction of Rho ( Fig . 3 ) , but resulted in preactiva - tion of platelets ( data not shown ) . C3 - pretreated platelets showed markedly reduced shape change in response to U46619 with only partial spheration and occasional filopo - dia formation ( Fig . 1 , I—L and Fig . 2 E ) . Since platelet shape change including protrusion of filopodia and lamellipodia is accompanied by actin poly - merization ( Siess , 1989 ; Wurzinger , 1990 ; Fox , 1993 ) we measured F - actin content in wild - type and G (cid:97) q - deficient platelets ( Fig . 4 ) . U46619 induced an increase in F - actin content of both , wild - type and G (cid:97) q - deficient platelets , which could be completely blocked by Y - 27632 . Reduction of the amount of functional Rho by pretreatment with 50 (cid:109) g / ml C3 exoenzyme for 2 h markedly reduced the effect of U46619 in wild - type and G (cid:97) q - deficient platelets . To identify the G proteins mediating receptor - induced platelet shape change we studied the coupling of TXA 2 and thrombin receptors to heterotrimeric G proteins in wild - type and G (cid:97) q - deficient mouse platelets . Receptors for both , thrombin and TXA 2 , have been shown to be able to couple to members of the G q , G 12 , and G i families ( Shenker et al . , 1991 ; Hung et al . , 1992 ; Offermanns et al . , 1994 ; Ushikubi et al . , 1994 ) . In membranes of human platelets , receptors activated by thrombin couple to G q , G 12 , G 13 , and G i , whereas TXA 2 receptors only activate G q , G 12 , and G 13 ( Offermanns et al . , 1994 ; Brass et al . , 1997 ) . Photolabeling of receptor - activated G proteins in mouse platelet membranes and subsequent immunopre - cipitation of individual G protein (cid:97) - subunits showed that in wild - type mouse platelets , activated TXA 2 and throm - bin receptors couple to G q , G 12 , and G 13 , whereas G i was only activated through the thrombin receptor ( Fig . 5 A ) . Figure 2 . Aggregation response of wild - type and G (cid:97) q - deficient platelets . Wild - type platelets ( B and D ) and platelets from G (cid:97) q ( (cid:50) / (cid:50) ) mice ( A , C , and E ) were preincubated for 20 min with the indicated concentrations of 8 - pCPT - cGMP ( pCPT - cGMP ) or Sp - 5 , 6 - DCl - cBIMPS ( cBIMPS ) ( A and B ) or for 30 min with the in - dicated concentrations of Y - 27632 ( C and D ) , and G (cid:97) q - deficient platelets were preincubated for 2 h in the absence or presence of C3 exoenzyme ( E ) . Thereafter , incubation was started by the ad - dition of 5 (cid:109) M U46619 . Shown is the relative light transmission through the platelet suspension . 0 % represents transmission through the platelet suspension before addition of U46619 , and 100 % represents transmission through the buffer alone .

G 12 / G 13 - mediated Platelet Shape Change 749 Similarly , in membranes from G (cid:97) q - deficient platelets , only G 12 and G 13 were activated through the TXA 2 receptor , whereas activated thrombin receptors coupled to G 12 , G 13 , and G i ( Fig . 5 B and data not shown ) . Coupling of throm - bin receptors to G i in murine platelets corresponded with the ability of thrombin to decrease cAMP levels in wild - type as well as in G (cid:97) q - deficient platelets , whereas activa - tion of TXA 2 receptors had no effect on adenylyl cyclase activity in wild - type or G (cid:97) q - deficient platelets ( data not shown ) . These data clearly demonstrate that in G (cid:97) q - defi - cient platelets thrombin - receptors couple to G 12 , G 13 , and G i , whereas only G 12 and G 13 are activated through TXA 2 receptors . Consequently , effects which can still be induced by TXA 2 receptor agonists in G (cid:97) q - deficient platelets like the shape change response are mediated by G 12 and / or G 13 . TXA 2 - activated G (cid:97) q - deficient platelets therefore rep - resent a model to study of G 12 / G 13 - mediated signaling pro - cesses . Agonist - induced platelet activation results in tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple proteins ( Ferrell and Martin , 1988 ; Nakamura and Yamamura , 1989 ; Golden and Brugge , 1989 ) . Phosphorylation of these proteins occurs in three temporal phases which have been experimentally distin - guished . Early tyrosine phosphorylation occurs by an in - tegrin - independent mechanism , whereas the second and third wave of tyrosine phosphorylation depends on the ag - gregation of platelets through binding of fibrinogen to (cid:97) IIb (cid:98) 3 - integrin ( glycoprotein IIb - IIIa ) ( Clark et al . , 1994b ) . In G (cid:97) q - deficient platelets that do not aggregate in re - sponse to thrombin or U46619 , only a subset of proteins became tyrosine phosphorylated upon exposure of plate - lets to both stimuli compared with wild - type platelets ( Fig . 6 , A and B ) . Most prominently , a rapid tyrosine phosphor - ylation of a protein of (cid:122) 72 kD could be observed in G (cid:97) q - deficient platelets activated with thrombin and U46619 . In contrast , several proteins with relative molecular masses of 40 and 95—130 kD which were tyrosine phosphorylated in wild - type platelets did not show increased tyrosine phosphorylation in activated G (cid:97) q - deficient platelets ( Fig . 6 , A and B ) . Platelets contain several tyrosine kinases ( Dhar and Shukla , 1993 ; Clark et al . , 1994b ; Jackson et al . , 1996 ) among which pp72 syk and pp60 c - src are rapidly activated af - ter stimulation of platelets in an aggregation - independent manner ( Wong et al . , 1992 ; Taniguchi et al . , 1993 ; Maeda et al . , 1993 ; Clark and Brugge , 1993 ; Clark et al . , 1994a ) . To test whether the 72 - kD protein that was tyrosine phos - phorylated in response to U46619 and thrombin in G (cid:97) q - deficient platelets represented pp72 syk , we immunoprecipi - tated pp72 syk from lysates of platelets exposed to U46619 . Anti - phosphotyrosine immunoblots of pp72 syk immuno - precipitates demonstrated increased tyrosine phosphory - lation of pp72 syk in response to U46619 in G (cid:97) q - deficient platelets as well as in wild - type platelets ( Fig . 6 C ) . Auto - phosphorylation of pp72 syk on tyrosine has been demon - strated to increase its enzymatic activity ( Taniguchi et al . , 1993 ; Clark et al . , 1994a ; Chacko et al . , 1994 ; Fujii et al . , 1994 ) . Fig . 6 C shows that incubation of wild - type and G (cid:97) q - deficient platelets with U46619 also resulted in a rapid increase in the activity of pp60 c - src . Increases in ty - rosine kinase activity could be observed within 10 s after addition of U46619 and were not affected by pretreatment of platelets with Y - 27632 or C3 exoenzyme ( data not shown ) . These data indicate that TXA 2 receptor - mediated activation of G 12 / G 13 leads to rapid activation of the ty - rosine kinases pp72 syk and pp60 c - src in mouse platelets . MLC phosphorylation has been suggested to be in - volved in early processes during platelet activation ( Dan - iel et al . , 1984 ) . To test whether TXA 2 receptor - G 12 / G 13 — mediated signaling in G (cid:97) q - deficient platelets resulted in Figure 4 . Determination of F - actin content . Wild - type and G (cid:97) q - deficient platelets were preincubated for 30 min in the absence ( c ) or presence of 10 (cid:109) M Y - 27632 ( Y ) or were pretreated for 2 h with 50 (cid:109) g / ml C3 exoenzyme ( C3 ) . Thereafter , platelets were in - cubated for 10 s in the absence ( (cid:50) ) or presence of 5 (cid:109) M U46619 ( (cid:49) ) , fixed , and then incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) - phalloidin . Platelets incubated for 2 h in C3 exoenzyme buffer alone showed full increase in F - actin content in response to U46619 ( data not shown ) . F - actin content was determined as described in Materials and Methods . Shown are means (cid:54) SD of triplicates . Figure 5 .

Mem - branes were solubilized and G protein (cid:97) - subunits ( G (cid:97) 12 , G (cid:97) 13 , G (cid:97) q , and G (cid:97) i ) were immunoprecipitated as de - scribed under Materials and Methods .

Precipitated proteins were sub - jected to SDS - PAGE . Shown are autoradiograms of dried SDS gels with the position of the 43 - kD standard protein shown on the left . on S ep t e m be r 2 , 2017 j c b . r up r e ss . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 144 , 1999 750 MLC phosphorylation , we activated platelets with U46619 for different times and separated phosphorylated and un - phosphorylated MLC on urea / glycin polyacrylamide gels . Separated proteins were blotted onto nitrocellulose filters and MLC was detected using a specific antiserum . Fig . 7 A shows that U46619 caused phosphorylation of the total de - tectable pool of MLC in wild - type platelets within 10 s . In - terestingly , a rapid and apparently complete phosphoryla - tion of MLC was also observed in G (cid:97) q - deficient platelets activated by U46619 . Chelation of extracellular Ca 2 (cid:49) by EGTA or preincubation of platelets with various tyrosine kinase inhibitors had no effect on U46619 - induced MLC phosphorylation in wild - type and G (cid:97) q - deficient platelets ( data not shown ) . Although the cAMP analogue Sp - 5 , 6 - DCl - cBIMPS completely inhibited MLC phosphorylation in wild - type and G (cid:97) q - deficient platelets the cGMP analogue 8 - pCPT - cGMP was without effect ( Fig . 7 , B and C ) . In smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts , the phosphorylation state of MLC has been shown to be under dual control of the Ca 2 (cid:49) / calmodulin - activated myosin light chain ki - nase ( MLCK ) as well as of myosin - phosphatase ( Somlyo and Somlyo , 1994 ; Burridge and Chrzanowska - Wodnicka , 1996 ) . Myosin - phosphatase has been demonstrated to be regulated by Rho / Rho - kinase ( Kimura et al . , 1996 ; Naru - miya et al . , 1997 ) . Since U46619 - induced platelet shape change was blocked by the Rho - kinase inhibitor Y - 27632 and was greatly inhibited after reduction of the amount of active Rho by C3 exoenzyme ( Figs . 1 and 2 ) we tested the effect of C3 exoenzyme and Y - 27632 on U46619 - induced phosphorylation of MLC . Fig . 7 , D—F shows that Y - 27632 blocked and C3 exoenzyme markedly inhibited U46619 - induced MLC - phosphorylation in wild - type as well as in G (cid:97) q - deficient platelets . Incomplete inhibition of MLC phosphorylation by C3 exoenzyme was most likely due to incomplete inactivation of Rho by C3 exoenzyme ( see Fig . 3 ) . Y - 27632 exerted its inhibitory effect on receptor - induced MLC phosphorylation with higher potency in G (cid:97) q - deficient platelets compared with wild - type platelets ( Fig . 7 , D and E ) . Similarly , the effect of C3 exoenzyme appeared to be more pronounced in the absence of G (cid:97) q ( Fig . 7 F ) . These data indicate that activation of G 12 / G 13 through the TXA 2 receptor results in MLC phosphoryla - tion and that this process involves Rho / Rho - kinase . The data also provide further evidence for the concept that MLC phosphorylation underlies platelet shape change . Discussion Full platelet activators like TXA 2 and thrombin function through G protein—coupled receptors which activate G q , G 12 , G 13 , and G i type G proteins ( Shenker et al . , 1991 ; Hung et al . , 1992 ; Ushikubi et al . , 1994 ; Offermanns et al . , 1994 ) . G (cid:97) 11 , a close homologue of G (cid:97) q and coexpressed with G (cid:97) q in most cells , is not present in platelets ( Milligan et al . , 1993 ; Johnson et al . , 1996 ; Offermanns et al . , 1997b ) . In G (cid:97) q - deficient platelets , the TXA 2 mimetic U46619 and thrombin fail to induce platelet aggregation and degranu - lation . This is accompanied by a lack of phospholipase C activation and Ca 2 (cid:49) mobilization after TXA 2 and throm - bin receptor activation supporting the concept that G q - mediated phospholipase C activation represents the main signaling process leading to full platelet activation ( Offer - manns et al . , 1997b ) . Lack of G (cid:97) q - mediated phospholipase C activation did not interfere with the ability of U46619 and thrombin to induce platelet shape change as shown by scanning electron microscopy of activated G (cid:97) q - deficient platelets ( see Fig . 1 ) and measurement of light transmis - sion through a suspension of G (cid:97) q - deficient platelets ( see Fig . 2 ) ( Offermanns et al . , 1997b ) . Thus , induction of Figure 6 . Effect of thrombin and U46619 on tyrosine phosphory - lation and pp72 syk and pp60 c - src - activity in wild - type and G (cid:97) q - deficient platelets .

Platelets were lysed and incubated with agarose conjugates of anti - pp72 syk IgG ( IP : Syk ) or of anti - pp60 c - src IgG ( IP : Src ) , and immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with antiphosphotyrosine antibodies ( WB : P - Y ) , anti - pp72 syk antibodies ( WB : Syk ) , anti - pp60 c - src antibodies ( WB : Src ) , or were subjected to in vitro kinase assays using histone as a substrate ( Histone - P ) . on S ep t e m be r 2 , 2017 j c b . r up r e ss . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m Klages et al . G 12 / G 13 - mediated Platelet Shape Change 751 platelet shape change through receptors of different plate - let stimuli is mediated by G proteins other than G q , and G (cid:97) q - deficient platelets provide a good model to study the mechanisms underlying receptor - induced shape change in - dependently of secondary processes involving secretion and aggregation . To identify the G proteins mediating platelet shape change we studied the coupling of TXA 2 and thrombin re - ceptors to G 12 family members and G i - type G proteins . Studies in human platelets have provided evidence that thrombin receptors but not TXA 2 receptors couple to G i - type G proteins resulting in an inhibition of adenylyl cy - clase ( Aktories and Jakobs , 1984 ; Houslay et al . , 1986 ; Brass et al . , 1988 ; Offermanns et al . , 1994 ) . Similarly , in mem - branes from wild - type and G (cid:97) q - deficient mouse platelets , thrombin increased incorporation of GTP - azidoanilide into G i , whereas U46619 was without effect ( see Fig . 5 ) . Only thrombin was able to decrease cAMP - levels in wild - type and G (cid:97) q - deficient platelets ( data not shown ) . The fact that thrombin but not TXA 2 - receptors couple to G i in mouse platelets clearly demonstrates that G i - mediated processes do not play a significant role in the regulation of platelet shape change . Both activated TXA 2 ( see Fig . 5 ) and thrombin receptors ( data not shown ) , coupled to G 12 and G 13 in wild - type and G (cid:97) q - deficient platelets . Thus , in G (cid:97) q - deficient platelets , the only G proteins found to be activated through TXA 2 receptors were G 12 and G 13 . We therefore conclude that G 12 and / or G 13 are the mediators of ligand - induced platelet shape change and that platelet shape change induced through TXA 2 receptors in G (cid:97) q - deficient platelets can be regarded as a G 12 / G 13 - regulated physiological cellular function . The signaling mechanisms regulating receptor - depen - dent platelet shape change are incompletely understood . Elevation of the cytosolic Ca 2 (cid:49) concentration is necessary for full platelet activation including granule secretion and aggregation . However , there is good evidence that eleva - tion of [ Ca 2 (cid:49) ] i alone is not sufficient to induce platelet shape change and that agonists can induce shape change without an increase in phospholipase C activity and with - out an increase in [ Ca 2 (cid:49) ] i ( Simpson et al . , 1986 ; Negrescu et al . , 1995 ; Ohkubo et al . , 1996 ; Offermanns et al . , 1997b ) . Tyrosine phosphorylation of various proteins has been associated with receptor - mediated induction of platelet shape change since this occurs rapidly in a Ca 2 (cid:49) - and (cid:97) IIb (cid:98) 3 - integrin—independent manner ( Clark et al . , 1994b ; Negrescu and Siess , 1996 ) . The mechanism of early recep - tor - induced tyrosine phosphorylation is not known . Ty - rosine kinases like pp72 syk and pp60 c - src , which are rapidly activated in a partially (cid:97) IIb (cid:98) 3 - integrin—independent man - ner , may be involved ( Clark et al . , 1994b ; Presek and Mar - tinson , 1997 ) , and pp72 syk has been implicated in the plate - let shape change response in porcine platelets ( Maeda et al . , 1995 ) . However , there is clear evidence that activation of pp72 syk alone is not sufficient for induction of shape change ( Negrescu and Siess , 1996 ) . We show here that TXA 2 - receptor—mediated activation of G 12 / G 13 leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of pp72 syk and activation of pp60 c - src ( see Fig . 6 ) supporting the concept that these tyrosine kinases are involved in early platelet activation . These data also indicate that G proteins of the G 12 - family can regulate ty - rosine kinases . The mechanism of this regulation remains unknown . MLC phosphorylation has been implicated in the regu - lation of cytoskeletal reorganization during platelet shape change ( Daniel et al . , 1984 ; Nachmias et al . , 1985 ) . Phos - phorylated myosin interacts mainly with central actin fila - ments in platelets , and the forming myosin—actin complex has been suggested to be involved in the granule central - ization process ( Fox and Phillips , 1982 ; Stark et al . , 1991 ; Fox , 1993 ) . The phosphorylation state of MLC is under dual control of MLCK and myosin - phosphatase . It is well Figure 7 .

( A ) Wild - type and G (cid:97) q - deficient platelets were incubated for the indicated time periods with buffer ( c ) or 5 (cid:109) M U46619 ( U ) . ( B and C ) Platelets were pre - incubated for 20 min without or with the synthetic cyclic nucleotides 8 - pCPT - cGMP ( cGMP ) or Sp - 5 , 6 - DCl - cBIMPS ( cAMP ) at the indicated concentrations . Thereafter , platelets were incubated for 10 s with buffer ( c ) or 5 (cid:109) M U46619 ( U ) . ( D and E ) Platelets were preincubated for 30 min without or with the Rho - kinase in - hibitor Y - 27632 at the indicated concen - trations ( 30 or 100 (cid:109) M for wild - type and 10 or 30 (cid:109) M for G (cid:97) q - deficient platelets ) . Incubation was conducted for 10 s with buffer ( c ) or 5 (cid:109) M U46619 ( U ) . ( F ) Wild - type and G (cid:97) q - deficient platelets were pre - incubated for 120 min without ( (cid:50) ) or with 50 (cid:109) g / ml C3 exoenzyme ( (cid:49) ) . Thereafter , platelets were incubated for 10 s with buffer ( c ) or 5 (cid:109) M U46619 ( U ) . Reactions were stopped by addition of perchloric acid , and phos - phorylation of MLC was determined using urea / glycin gels as described in Materials and Methods . Shown are autoluminograms of anti - MLC immunoblots . Phosphorylation of MLC results in a faster mobility ( lower position ) of MLC on urea / glycin gels . on S ep t e m be r 2 , 2017 j c b . r up r e ss . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 144 , 1999 752 established that increase in [ Ca 2 (cid:49) ] i activates the Ca 2 (cid:49) / calmodulin - dependent MLCK . MLC phosphorylation by MLCK leads to actin—myosin interaction resulting in ac - tin - stimulated ATPase activity of smooth muscle and non - muscle myosin ( Somlyo and Somlyo , 1994 ; Kohama et al . , 1996 ) . Recently , it has been shown that upstream regula - tion of myosin phosphatase occurs independently of the cytosolic free calcium concentration through phosphoryla - tion and inactivation of its regulatory subunit by Rho - kinase , a specific target of the small GTPase Rho ( Ki - mura et al . , 1996 ; Narumiya et al . , 1997 ) . In addition , Rho - kinase can directly phosphorylate MLC in vitro ( Amano et al . , 1996 ) . There is increasing evidence that Rho / Rho - kinase—mediated MLC phosphorylation is in - volved in contractile responses in various cell types like vascular smooth muscle cells ( Uehata et al . , 1997 ) , fibro - blasts ( Chihara et al . , 1997 ) , neuroblastoma cells ( Amano et al . , 1998 ; Hirose et al . , 1998 ) , astrocytoma cells ( Ma - jumdar et al . , 1998 ) , or endothelial cells ( Essler et al . , 1998 ) . It is , however , unclear how the Rho - mediated path - way is regulated through receptors . The TXA 2 mimetic U46619 caused a rapid phosphoryla - tion of MLC in wild - type and G (cid:97) q - deficient platelets ( see Fig . 7 ) . Since U46619 does not lead to elevation of [ Ca 2 (cid:49) ] i in the absence of G (cid:97) q ( Offermanns et al . , 1997b ) and since Rho - kinase inhibitor Y - 27632 and C3 exoenzyme inhibited U46619 - induced MLC phosphorylation in G (cid:97) q - deficient platelets , we conclude that a Rho / Rho - kinase—mediated pathway regulating MLC phosphorylation operates in platelets . Consistent with this , the Rho - kinase p160ROCK has been shown to be phosphorylated upon activation of human platelets in an (cid:97) IIb (cid:98) 3 - integrin—independent way ( Fujita et al . , 1997 ) . In addition , Rho and Rho - kinase can be coimmunoprecipitated with the myosin - binding subunit of myosin phosphatase from human platelets , and treat - ment of platelets with a TXA 2 - mimetic leads to rapid phosphorylation and inactivation of myosin phosphatase ( Nakai et al . , 1997 ) . Conflicting data exist with regard to the role of Rho in early platelet activation as determined by C3 exoenzyme treatment . This is most likely due to the difficulties associated with the length of incubation and the high concentration of C3 exoenzyme required to inac - tivate a sufficient fraction of Rho . Although partial inacti - vation of the RhoA pool in human platelets by C3 exoen - zyme has been shown to inhibit platelet activation ( Morii et al . , 1992 ) , a recent report showed that ADP ribosylation of (cid:122) 90 % of Rho in human platelets did not affect inside - out signaling of integrin (cid:97) IIb (cid:98) 3 , ligand - induced aggregation and F - actin content ( Leng et al . , 1998 ) . Our data clearly support a role of Rho in early platelet activation . In wild - type platelets in which U46619 induces an ele - vation of [ Ca 2 (cid:49) ] i and most likely leads to Ca 2 (cid:49) / calmodu - lin - MLCK—mediated MLC phosphorylation , Rho - kinase blocker Y - 27632 and C3 exoenzyme also inhibited MLC phosphorylation induced by U46619 . Interestingly , both agents appeared to be less potent in wild - type platelets than in G (cid:97) q - deficient platelets ( see Fig . 7 , D—F ) . This sug - gests that both , Ca 2 (cid:49) - mediated activation of MLCK and inhibition of myosin phosphatase through Rho / Rho - kinase may synergistically increase MLC phosphorylation in acti - vated wild - type platelets . In contrast , receptor - mediated MLC phosphorylation in G (cid:97) q - deficient platelets depends on the Ca 2 (cid:49) - independent , Rho - mediated pathway . Since shape change could be inhibited by the C3 exoenzyme as well as by Y - 27632 in G (cid:97) q - deficient platelets ( see Figs . 1 and 2 ) we suggest that Rho / Rho - kinase—mediated MLC phosphorylation is involved in TXA 2 receptor - induced platelet shape change . Cyclic nucleotides like cAMP and cGMP mediate physi - ological inhibition of platelet activation through activation of cAMP - and cGMP - dependent kinases . Although ana - logues of both cyclic nucleotides can block full platelet activation , only cAMP analogues inhibit platelet shape change ( Matsuoka et al . , 1989 ; Menshikov et al . , 1993 ) . Similarly , we observed that the cAMP analogue Sp - 5 , 6 - DCl - cBIMPS but not the cGMP analogue 8 - pCPT - cGMP inhibited TXA 2 receptor - G 12 / G 13 —mediated shape change and MLC phosphorylation in G (cid:97) q - deficient platelets ( see Figs . 2 and 7 ) . Inhibition of MLC phosphorylation by Sp - 5 , 6 - DCl - cBIMPS but not by 8 - pCPT - cGMP suggests that the Rho / Rho - kinase—mediated signaling cascade may be inhibited by the cAMP - dependent pathway . A similar role of cAMP was suggested for the inhibition of Rho / Rho - kinase—mediated neurite remodeling and morphol - ogy change in epithelial - like cells ( Hirose et al . , 1998 ; Dong et al . , 1998 ) . Rho has been shown to be regulated by the activated (cid:97) - subunits of G 12 and G 13 ( Buhl et al . , 1995 ; Gohla et al . , 1998 ; Kozasa et al . , 1998 ) . Since G 12 and G 13 are the only G proteins activated through TXA 2 receptors in G (cid:97) q - defi - cient platelets and since TXA 2 receptor - mediated MLC phosphorylation in G (cid:97) q - deficient platelets was inhibited by C3 exoenzyme and Rho - kinase inhibitor Y - 27632 we suggest that TXA 2 receptor - induced G 12 / G 13 activation re - sults in MLC phosphorylation through Rho - mediated acti - vation of Rho - kinase . Activated Rho - kinase may phos - phorylate MLC directly or act through phosphorylation and inhibition of myosin phosphatase . Additional , syner - gistic regulation of MLC phosphorylation in wild - type platelets occurs through G q - mediated activation of MLCK . The mechanism by which G 12 / G 13 activate Rho remains to be elucidated . Epidermal growth factor tyrosine kinase has recently been involved in the G (cid:97) 13 - induced Rho - depen - dent actin stress fiber formation in fibroblasts ( Gohla et al . , 1998 ) . However , various tyrosine kinase inhibitors were unable to block TXA 2 receptor - induced , G 12 / G 13 - mediated MLC phosphorylation in G (cid:97) q - deficient platelets ( data not shown ) . This suggests that in platelets , G 12 / G 13 - induced Rho activation is not mediated by receptor - or nonreceptor - tyrosine kinases . Another possibility is that regulation of Rho by G 12 / G 13 is mediated by a Rho - spe - cific GEF . Genetic evidence in Drosophila showed that the Drosophila RhoGEF , DRhoGEF2 , functions down - stream of the Drosophila G 12 / G 13 homologue concertina ( Barrett et al . , 1997 ) , and it has recently been shown that the related mammalian RhoGEF , p115 RhoGEF , can di - rectly link G (cid:97) 13 to the regulation of Rho ( Hart et al . , 1998 ; Kozasa et al . , 1998 ) . Using G (cid:97) q - deficient platelets which do not aggregate and secrete but undergo shape change in response to vari - ous stimuli , we show that activation of G 12 / G 13 is sufficient to induce platelet shape change . Thus , different G pro - tein—mediated signaling pathways appear to be specifically involved in the regulation of distinct processes during re - on S ep t e m be r 2 , 2017 j c b . r up r e ss . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m Klages et al . G 12 / G 13 - mediated Platelet Shape Change 753 ceptor - induced platelet activation . Although G q is neces - sary for full platelet activation including aggregation and secretion , activation of G i may counteract anti - aggrega - tory influences through inhibition of adenylyl cyclase , and G 12 / G 13 appear to be centrally involved in the platelet shape change response . Our data also indicate that G 12 / G 13 can link receptors to tyrosine kinases as well as to Rho / Rho - kinase—mediated regulation of MLC phosphoryla - tion , and we provide evidence that the latter pathway par - ticipates in the receptor - mediated induction of platelet shape change .
