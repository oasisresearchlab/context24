DaADF3 - Mediated Cold Tolerance in Plants Frontiers in Plant Science | www . frontiersin . org 2 September 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 734500 INTRODUCTION The Antarctic monocot plant Deschampsia antarctica Desv . has a considerably wider habitat and larger numbers of populations than Colobanthus quitensis , the Antarctic dicot plant ( Komárková et al . , 1985 ) . D . antarctica is highly sensitive to climate change and has shown rapid population increases and enhanced sexual reproduction success rates ( Fowbert and Smith , 1994 ) during regional warming in the Antarctic Peninsula ( Smith , 2003 ) . Several studies have focused on the physiological and biochemical changes that allow D . antarctica to colonize harsh Antarctic environments . D . antarctica exhibits specialized morphological properties , such as distinct leaf anatomy and chloroplast ultra - structure , that influence its photosynthetic efficiency in extreme environments ( Giełwanowska et al . , 2005 ; Sáez et al . , 2019 ) , and its tolerance to ultraviolet B - induced oxidative stress is enhanced by a combination of phenolic molecules synthesis and the activation of both enzymatic and non - enzymatic antioxidant systems ( Köhler et al . , 2017 ) . The transcriptome responses of D . antarctica have been examined under various abiotic stress conditions ( Lee et al . , 2013 , 2014 ) . Increases in ice recrystallization inhibition protein ( DaIRIP ) expression and recrystallization inhibition activity in response to freezing stress may contribute to the cryotolerance of D . antarctica ( John et al . , 2009 ) . In particular , the transcription factor genes DaCBF4 and DaCBF7 , which regulate the expression of cold - regulated genes , can enhance plant cold tolerance when ectopically expressed in rice ( Byun et al . , 2015 , 2018 ) . DaGolS2 , which encodes a galactinol synthase that is the key enzyme mediating raffinose family oligosaccharide synthesis , improves the resistance of transgenic rice to both cold and drought ( Cui et al . , 2020 ) . These findings imply that D . antarctica could be a model for studying the genetic and metabolic mechanisms of plant adaptations to various abiotic stresses ; however , the molecular mechanisms of its adaptation to Antarctic environments remain poorly understood . The actin cytoskeleton performs diverse cellular processes . The three - dimensional formation , disassembly , and dynamics of actin structure are regulated by diverse actin - binding proteins ( Bamburg , 1999 ; Lappalainen , 2016 ) . One such protein , actin - depolymerizing factor ( ADF ) , is composed of a single folded ADF homology domain . The enzyme activity of ADF influences actin filament turnover mainly by severing actin filaments ( Carlier et al . , 1997 ) . The functions of ADF / cofilins are modulated by several factors , such as pH ( Wioland et al . , 2018 ) , phosphorylation ( Meng et al . , 2004 ) , and interaction with other actin - binding proteins ( Xiang et al . , 2007 ) . Most vertebrates have one ADF and two cofilins , which are divided into muscle and non - muscle cofilins ( Ono et al . , 1994 ) . Xenopus frogs express two ADF / cofilins , whereas only one ADF / cofilin gene is found in Caenorhabditis elegans ( Maciver and Hussey , 2002 ) . In contrast , plants have many more ADF / cofilin genes than animals ; these are classified into multiple subgroups according to their sequence homology ( Huang et al . , 2020 ) . ADFs participate in a vast number of cellular processes , such as cell mobility ( Tang and Gerlach , 2017 ) , cytokinesis ( Li et al . , 2015 ) , and plant cell growth ( Hussey et al . , 2006 ) . The roles of ADF have been studied extensively in vivo among plants with large numbers of ADF genes ; notably , the important roles of actin filament structures in pollen development have been analyzed in several studies ( Smertenko et al . , 2001 ; Allwood et al . , 2002 ; Xiang et al . , 2007 ; Jiang et al . , 2019 ) . In addition , the pollen - specific roles of AtADF7 and AtADF10 during male gametophyte development have been examined based on their spatial and temporal expression , revealing functional redundancy ( Bou Daher et al . , 2011 ) . Several studies have demonstrated ADF functions in pathological responses ( Inada , 2017 ) . Actin polymerization is necessary for increasing actin filament density , which is linked to host plant susceptibility to pathogenic and non - pathogenic bacteria ( Henty - Ridilla et al . , 2013 ) . The actin cytoskeleton participates in the regulation of stomatal movement , showing different patterns during stomatal opening and closing ( Zhao et al . , 2011 ) . AtADF5 promotes stomatal closure through the reorganization of actin filaments in response to abscisic acid ( ABA ) and dehydration stress in a process mediated by the ABA signaling pathway via the ABF transcription factor DPBF3 , which binds to the ADF5 promoter and turns on its gene expression ( Qian et al . , 2019 ) . Vegetative profilins and ADFs are specifically upregulated by heat stress , with different expression patterns ; actin filament reorganization has been observed in Arabidopsis seedlings treated with heat stress ( Fan et al . , 2016 ) . Mechanical wounding has been shown to increase microfilament bundles , whereas hypoxia triggers a rapid decrease in polymerized actin and drastic inhibition of protein synthesis in potato , implying that actin cytoskeleton organization may affect translational activity under stress conditions in potato ( Morelli et al . , 1998 ) . In maize , 13 ZmADF genes showed diverse expression patterns in various tissues in response to different stimuli , including abiotic and phytohormone stresses , implying their specific roles in plant growth , development , and external stimulus responses ( Huang et al . , 2020 ) . Wheat active ADF protein was induced during cold acclimation , implying a correlation with an increased freezing tolerance in freezing - tolerant wheat cultivars ( Ouellet et al . , 2001 ) . OsADF3 expression was upregulated in root tissues in response to ABA or abiotic stress treatment . Transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing OsADF3 showed enhanced tolerance to dehydration stress , accompanied by the upregulation of several drought tolerance response genes ( Huang et al . , 2012 ) . The association of these ADF functions with exogenous stimuli , especially abiotic stresses , indicates the crucial roles of these proteins in plants under unfavorable conditions . In this study , we investigated the functions of an ADF in D . antarctica , which has adapted and survived harsh Antarctic environments . Eight ADF genes were identified in the transcriptome , and DaADF3 was selected based on transcriptional responses under environmental stress conditions . To investigate the functions of DaADF3 related to cold stress , we generated Byun et al . DaADF3 - Mediated Cold Tolerance in Plants Frontiers in Plant Science | www . frontiersin . org 3 September 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 734500 transgenic rice plants overexpressing DaADF3 and analyzed their phenotypes under low - temperature stress . MATERIALS AND METHODS Plant Materials and Growth Conditions Deschampsia antarctica was collected near the King Sejong Antarctic Station ( 62 ° 14 ' 29 " S ; 58 ° 44 ' 18 " W ) on the Barton Peninsula of King George Island in January 2007 . The plants were transplanted , cultured in vitro in a tissue culture medium consisting of half - strength Murashige and Skoog ( MS ; Duchefa Biochemie , Haarlem , The Netherlands , 2 % sucrose , and 0 . 8 % phytoagar ; pH 5 . 7 ) under a 16 - h / 8 - h light / dark ( long - day ) photoperiod with a light intensity of 150 μ mol m − 2 s − 1 at 15 ° C , and transferred to new medium every 3 weeks . Dry seeds from japonica rice ( Oryza sativa L . cv . dongjin ) were washed with 70 % ethanol and then sterilized with 0 . 4 % NaClO solution . Sterilized seeds were germinated and grown on half - strength MS medium supplemented with 3 % sucrose and 0 . 75 % phytoagar ( pH 5 . 7 ) for 10 – 12 days . Germinated seedlings were transplanted to soil and grown in a greenhouse at 25 – 30 ° C under a long - day photoperiod . Identification and Analysis of ADF Family Genes in D . antarctica Rice ADF family members were searched in the Phytozome 13 Oryza sativa v7 . 0 database . 1 Rice ADF protein sequences were used as queries to search homologous sequences using the BLASTX program and previously reported D . antarctica transcriptome assembly data ( Lee et al . , 2013 ) . Redundant sequences were discarded by manual curation . The Pfam and SMART software packages 2 were used to confirm the presence of the ADF domain ( SM000102 ) . The protein isoelectric point ( PI ) and molecular weight ( Mw ) of each gene product were calculated using the ExPasy Compute pI / Mw tool . 3 Subcellular localization of the identified proteins was analyzed using the ProtComp v9 . 0 program of the Softberry web tool . 4 The Multiple EM for Motif Elicitation ( MEME 5 ) online software was used to identify possible conserved motifs in the amino acid sequences of DaADF proteins . Putative cis - regulatory elements around 2000 - bp upstream of the start codon of the DaCBF3 genomic sequence ( NCBI accession no . MW818101 ) were identified using the PlantCARE web tool . 6 The NCBI BLAST search tool 7 was used to find DaADF homologous sequences from other plants and to compare the identity among the eight selected 1 https : / / phytozome - next . jgi . doe . gov / 2 http : / / smart . embl - heidelberg . de / 3 https : / / web . expasy . org / compute _ pi / 4 http : / / www . softberry . com / berry . phtml ? topic = protcomppl & group = programs & sub group = proloc 5 https : / / meme - suite . org / tools / meme 6 http : / / bioinformatics . psb . ugent . be / webtools / plantcare / html / 7 http : / / www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov / BLAST / DaADF proteins . The NCBI accession numbers of the eight DaADFs are listed in Table 1 . Phylogenetic Analysis The amino acid sequences of DaADFs and ADF homologs from monocot crops , eudicots , and bryophytes were retrieved from the GenBank database and proofread . Phylogenetic tree was constructed from the datasets using the neighbor - joining method based on the JTT matrix - based model using the MEGA X software ( Kumar et al . , 2018 ) . All positions with < 95 % site coverage were eliminated . We allowed < 5 % alignment gaps , missing data , and ambiguous bases at any position . Support for internal branches was tested using bootstrap analyses with 1 , 000 replicates . The GenBank accession numbers used are listed in Supplementary Table 1 . Stress Treatment For low - temperature treatment , D . antarctica plants grown at 15 ° C were transferred to a climate chamber at 4 ° C for various time periods ( 1 h to 7 days ) . For dehydration treatment , plants were transferred to filter paper , dried at 15 ° C , and collected at different time points ( 1 , 2 , and 4 h ) after the imposition of stress . For each treatment , at least two plants were used per biological replicate and a total of three biological replicates per treatment were collected . All sampling for expression analysis was conducted at the same time to avoid variation according to circadian rhythm . Real - Time Quantitative Reverse - Tanscription Polymerase Chain Reaction Total RNA was extracted from mature leaves of D . antarctica and rice plants using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit ( Qiagen , Hilden , Germany ) . The quantity and quality of RNAs were determined using an ND - 1000 spectrophotometer ( NanoDrop Technologies , Wilmington , DE , United States ) . First - strand cDNA was synthesized from 2 μ g total RNA using TOPscript reverse transcriptase ( Enzynomics , South Korea ) and oligo ( dT ) primers . RT - qPCR analysis was performed in 20 - μ l reaction mixtures consisting of 1 μ l 1 : 10 diluted cDNA template , 2 μ M of each primer , and 10 μ l TB Green Premix Ex Taq ( TaKaRa , Japan ) . The amplification procedure was as follows : denaturation and enzyme activation at 95 ° C for 5 min , followed by 40 cycles at 95 ° C for 10 s , 55 ° C for 10 s , and 72 ° C for 15 s . The DaEF1a gene was used as an internal control . The DNA sequences of primers used for PCR amplification are listed in Supplementary Table 2 . Subcellular Localization Assay The 3 ' end of the DaADF3 coding region was tagged with synthetic green fluorescent protein ( sGFP ) in - frame and inserted into the pBI221 binary vector containing the 35S CaMV promoter . The 35S : DaADF3 construct was expressed in the D . antarctica protoplast using the PEG - mediated DNA transfer method . Fluorescent signals were visualized by fluorescence microscopy ( BX51 , Olympus , Japan ) . We used 35S : sGFP as a cytosolic marker . Byun et al . DaADF3 - Mediated Cold Tolerance in Plants Frontiers in Plant Science | www . frontiersin . org 4 September 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 734500 Generation of DaADF3 - Overexpressing Transgenic Rice Plants Full - length coding region of DaADF3 was ligated into pGA2897 binary vector plasmids containing the maize Ubiquitin promoter ( Ubi ) . The Ubi : DaADF3 recombinant construct was transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain LBA4404 via electroporation as previously described ( Park et al . , 2016 ) . All rice transformation procedures followed established protocols as recently described by Cui et al . ( 2018 ) . Generated transgenic rice T0 plants were transplanted in soil under greenhouse conditions and further propagated under paddy field conditions . The harvested transgenic seeds of individual plant were germinated in the half - strength MS medium supplemented with hygromycin B ( 40 mg L − 1 ) to select the homozygous T2 generation . Homozygous T3 DaADF3 - overexpressing ( independent lines # A , # B , and # C ) transgenic rice progeny were used for our phenotypic analysis . Phenotype Analysis of Wild - Type ( WT ) , Ubi : DaADF3 Rice Plants For low - temperature stress treatment , 5 - week - old rice plants grown at 28 ° C in the same pot under a long - day photoperiod were transferred to a cold room at 4 ° C . After 7 days of cold treatment , the plants were recovered at 28 ° C for 20 – 25 days and their growth patterns were monitored as recently described ( Cui et al . , 2018 ) . Plants that resumed growth with green , healthy leaves were regarded as having survived ; the survival rates were determined at 1 month of recovery . Data were obtained from at least six biologically independent experiments . Electrolyte leakage analysis was conducted using 8 - day - old whole seedlings at different cold treatment time points ( 0 , 5 , and 10 days ) at 4 ° C . The cold stress - treated seedlings of WT and transgenic rice plants were soaked in a test tube containing 35 ml distilled water on an orbital shaker ( 200 rpm ) at room temperature overnight . The total leaf chlorophyll ( chlorophyll a + chlorophyll b ) content of WT and transgenic rice plants was measured before and after stress treatment as described by Min et al . ( 2016 ) with slight modifications . The amounts of chlorophyll a + chlorophyll b were measured at 664 . 2 nm and 648 . 6 nm , respectively , using an enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay microplate reader ( VERSAmax , Molecular Devices , United States ) and normalized to the dry weight of the leaves of each genotype . The electrolyte conductivity of each sample was determined following the method of Min et al . ( 2016 ) . Light - grown 8 - day - old whole seedlings of WT and DaADF3 overexpressors were incubated at 4 ° C for 0 , 5 , and 10 days . Then , the seedlings were soaked in 35 ml distilled water at 25 ° C overnight , and electrolyte leakage was measured before and after autoclaving using a conductivity meter ( Orion Star A212 , Thermo Scientific , United States ) . Visualization of Actin Dynamics Through Fluorescence Microscopy Immunofluorescence experiments were conducted to detect G - actin monomers and F - actin filaments as previously described ( He et al . , 2006 ) . For G - actin and F - actin labeling , root tissues were fixed by vacuum infiltration for 5 min in a freshly prepared solution of 1 % formaldehyde in phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) , kept in the fixation solution for 1 h , and then washed in PBS three times . Then , 1 - cm pieces of the root apices were cut and incubated in a mixture of Alexa Fluor 488 - DNase I ( Invitrogen ) and Alexa Fluor 568 - phalloidin ( Invitrogen ) in PBS ( 0 . 137 M NaCl , 2 . 7 mM KCl , 1 . 8 mM KH 2 PO 4 , 10 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , pH 7 . 4 ) . After 10 min , the samples were washed five times with PBS and observed using a cooled charge - coupled device camera with a laser scanning confocal microscope ( LSM510 META ; Carl Zeiss , Germany ) . The G - actin and F - actin signals were excited by lasers at 488 and 550 nm , respectively . The fluorescence signals were measured using a sliding 0 . 3 - μ m detection window in a confocal microscope . RESULTS Identification of ADF Genes in D . antarctica Transcriptome To identify the ADF gene family members in D . antarctica , we searched a previously reported transcriptome database ( Lee et al . , 2013 ) using the BLASTX program with rice ADF proteins as queries and used the SMART web tool to determine whether the ADF domain ( SM000102 ) was present in the candidate ADF genes . After manual curation , eight ADF domain - containing genes were identified ; these eight genes were designated as D . antarctica ADF ( DaADF ) and the corresponding proteins were named DaADF . A serial number was assigned to each gene according to the corresponding TABLE 1 | Detailed information of 8 actin - depolymerizing factor ( ADF ) family genes identified in this study .

Byun et al . DaADF3 - Mediated Cold Tolerance in Plants Frontiers in Plant Science | www . frontiersin . org 5 September 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 734500 rice homolog with the highest similarity . The predicted size of DaADFs ranged from 139 to 154 amino acids , the isoelectric point ranged from 4 . 41 to 8 . 73 , and the molecular weight ranged from 14 . 74 to 17 . 45 kDa , and the grand average of hydropathy ( GRAVY ) values of all DaADF were < 0 , indicating that they are hydrophilic . Subcellular localization of the proteins was predicted to be multi - localized proteins , in the cytoplasm and nucleus ( Table 1 ) . The DaADFs shared > 80 % sequence identity with Triticum aestivum and other monocot ADFs , ranging from 75 to 98 % ( Supplementary Table 3 ) . The sequence identity among the eight DaADFs ranged from 39 to 72 % ( Supplementary Table 4 ) . Phylogenetic Analysis of the DaADF Family To investigate the phylogenetic relationships among the DaADF family , we selected five flowering plants as references , including Arabidopsis thaliana , Solanum lycopersicum , Oryza sativa , Triticum aestivum , and Zea mays , as well as three bryophytes as an outgroup : Marchantia polymorpha , Physcomitrium patens , and Sphagnum fallax ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . The DaADFs were distributed in five subfamilies ( Groups A to E ) , excluding the outgroup . DaADF5 clustered in Group A , DaADF2 and DaADF10 clustered in Group B , DaADF1 and DaADF9 clustered in Group C , DaADF7 clustered in Group D , and DaADF3 and DaADF4 clustered in Group E ( Figure 1 , and Table 1 ) . The conserved motifs of DaADF family proteins were further identified using the MEME online software ( Supplementary Figure 1 ) , which predicted that DaADF family proteins contain at least four conserved motifs . Six of the eight DaADF proteins have an arrangement of motifs ( order , 3 – 2 – 1 - 4 ) , whereas motif 4 was missing from DaADF3 and DaADF4 in Group E , which had motif arrangements of 3 – 2 – 1 - 5 and 3 – 2 – 1 - 7 , respectively . In summary , the overall structure of the DaADF family is highly conserved and relatively stable ; however , we assume that DaADF3 and DaADF4 , which belong to Group E , underwent an independent differentiation process during evolution . Expression Analysis of DaADF Genes in the Antarctic Field We performed gene expression analysis of the eight selected DaADF genes in D . antarctica samples previously collected in Antarctica ( Cui et al . , 2020 ) to identify genes related to adaptation to the Antarctic environment . Briefly , naturally colonized D . antarctica plants ( field control ) were collected on the Barton Peninsula of King George Island and incubated in the laboratory ( 15 ° C , long - day photoperiod ) for 6 days ( L3d and L6d ; Figure 2A ) . The plants were transferred back to an Antarctic field and harvested at different time points ( 12 h and 3 days ) . When the plants were transported from the field to the laboratory , the expression of DaIRIP , a cold - induced gene in D . antarctica ( John et al . , 2009 ) , declined to the background level . However , the transcript levels of DaIRIP rapidly increased after the plants were transferred back to the field ( from 12 h to 3 days ; Figure 2A ) . Expressional changes in the eight DaADF genes under the same experimental conditions showed that the transcripts of DaADF3 were reduced in samples incubated in the laboratory , and considerably elevated in samples transferred back to the Antarctic field DaADF3 having a pattern of expressional alterations most similar to that of DaIRIP ( Figure 2B ) . DaADF Gene Expression in Response to Cold and Drought Next , we investigated the expression changes of DaADF genes under low - temperature and dehydration treatment , as representative environmental stresses in Antarctica . Each stimulus was applied to D . antarctica plants grown at 15 ° C in the laboratory , and gene expression changes were evaluated by RT - qPCR . The genes DaADF2 , DaADF3 , DaADF4 , DaADF5 , and DaADF7 showed higher gene expression under cold stress treatment . Among these , DaADF3 showed the most significant expressional changes , reaching a peak at 8 h and slowly decreasing thereafter ( Figure 3A ) . DaADF3 also displayed prominent transcriptional changes in response to drought ( Figure 3B ) , showing a nearly 100 - fold difference compared to the control condition . In conclusion , among the eight DaADF genes identified , DaADF3 showed the largest changes in gene expression in response to cold and drought stresses . The results shown in Figures 2 , 3 imply that DaADF3 encodes an ADF that plays key roles in the adaptation mechanism of D . antarctica for survival in harsh Antarctic environmental conditions . Analysis of Cis - Acting Elements of DaADF3 In combination with the expression characteristics of DaADF3 , we analyzed cis - acting elements to explore its specificity in response to abiotic stress treatments and to provide evidence for its regulatory control at the transcriptional level . The most prominent cis - acting elements were stress - related , including multiple DRE core and ABRE elements ( Supplementary Figure 2 ) . This finding indirectly explains the high expression of DaADF3 under cold and drought stress treatment . The DaADF3 promoter region also contains light responsive elements , such as AE - box , GATA - motif , and G - box , and several hormone responsive elements , such as AuxRR - core , CGTCA - motif , and TGACG - motif , which are associated with responses to a variety of abiotic stresses . Subcellular Localization of DaADF3 Subcellular localization of DaADF3 was investigated via a protoplast transient expression system . Protoplasts were prepared from mature leaves of D . antarctica plants and transfected with the 35S : DaADF3 - sGFP fusion construct . The expressed proteins were visualized by fluorescence microscopy . Fluorescence signals for DaADF3 were predominantly located in the cytosolic fraction and nucleus ( Figure 4 ) , as predicted by the results shown in Table 1 . Generation of DaADF3 - Overexpressing Transgenic Rice Plants Although genetic transformation has been widely used to explore the cellular roles of stress - related genes in diverse plant species , Byun et al . DaADF3 - Mediated Cold Tolerance in Plants Frontiers in Plant Science | www . frontiersin . org 6 September 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 734500 stable gene transformation and regeneration of D . antarctica have not yet been established . Deschampsia antarctica and rice , a monocot model plant , belong to the same Poaceae family . Therefore , to investigate the role of DaADF3 in planta , we generated transgenic rice plants that constitutively expressed DaADF3 under the control of the maize Ubiquitin promoter ( Ubi ) . Under normal growth conditions , the DaADF3 - overexpressing T3 transgenic rice plants ( Ubi : DaADF3 ) exhibited no detectable morphological differences compared with WT rice plants . Based on the results of genomic Southern blot analysis , three independent Ubi : DaAD3F lines ( # A , # B , and # C ) were selected , in which DaADF3 transcripts were detected by RT - PCR ( Figure 5 ) . Ubi : DaADF3 Plants Exhibited Greater Cold Stress Tolerance Than WT Plants To examine the cold tolerant phenotypes of the DaADF3 overexpressors , WT and T3 Ubi : DaADF3 ( independent lines # A , # B , and # C ) rice plants were grown at 28 ° C for 5 weeks under a long - day photoperiod , transferred to a cold room at 4 ° C , and incubated under continuous light . After 7 days of low - temperature treatment , these plants were transferred back to the growth room at 28 ° C , allowed to recover and grow for 20 – 25 days , while their survival was monitored . Under our experimental conditions , most of the WT rice plants exhibited discolored leaves with markedly reduced turgor after recovery from cold stress and were unable to FIGURE 1 | Phylogenetic analysis of actin depolymerizing factor ( ADF ) proteins . The full - length amino acid sequences of DaADFs and homologs from other plants and algae were retrieved from the GenBank database and proofread . Phylogenetic trees were constructed from the datasets using the neighbor - joining method based on the JTT matrix - based model using the MEGA X software . Evolutionary distances were computed using the JTT matrix - based method . The ADF members were divided into five groups ( A to E ) . Byun et al . DaADF3 - Mediated Cold Tolerance in Plants Frontiers in Plant Science | www . frontiersin . org 7 September 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 734500 grow ( survival : 8 . 4 % ± 3 . 0 % ) . In contrast , the DaADF3 overexpressors clearly showed healthier morphology and resumed growth after being relieved from cold stress ( survival : 44 . 1 % ± 4 . 7 to 62 . 3 % ± 6 . 4 % ; Figures 6A , B ) . To measure the total leaf chlorophyll content ( chlorophyll a + chlorophyll b ) , mature leaves were detached from plants of each genotype before and after cold treatment . Before cold treatment , the chlorophyll content of WT and Ubi : DaADF3 plants was indistinguishable . However , the DaADF3 overexpressors contained higher amounts of chlorophyll than WT rice plants in response to cold temperature . After 1 month of recovery from cold treatment at 4 ° C , the chlorophyll content of WT leaves was 0 . 65 ± 0 . 19 mg g − 1 dry weight ( DW ) , whereas the chlorophyll contents of the Ubi : DaADF3 plants ranged from 11 . 4 ± 1 . 6 to 11 . 8 ± 0 . 6 mg g − 1 DW ( Figure 6C ) . To quantify the cellular A B FIGURE 2 | Expression profiles of DaADF homologs in response to different growth conditions in the Antarctic field and the laboratory .

DaADF3 - Mediated Cold Tolerance in Plants Frontiers in Plant Science | www . frontiersin . org 8 September 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 734500 response to cold stress , an electrolyte leakage assay was performed . WT seedlings showed higher ion leakage rates ( 11 . 9 ± 0 . 8 % at 5 days and 21 . 5 ± 2 . 4 % at 10 days ) than Ubi : DaADF3 seedlings ( 9 . 4 ± 0 . 9 % to 9 . 9 ± 0 . 4 % at 5 days and 9 . 3 ± 1 . 0 % to 11 . 4 ± 1 . 2 % at 10 days ) in response to prolonged cold stress ( Figure 6D ) . To further assess the role of DaADF3 in actin cytoskeleton structural dynamics , we observed G - actin and F - actin in the root tips of WT and Ubi : DaADF3 line # B transgenic rice plants using Alexa Fluor 488 - DNase I ( G - actin ) and Alexa Fluor 568 - phalloidin ( F - actin ) double labeling and laser scanning confocal microscopy . The ratio of G - actin to F - actin was found to be higher in Ubi : DaADF3 transgenic rice plants than in the WT , which indicate that DaADF3 functions in planta to depolymerize F - actin into G - actin in the root tips of transgenic plants ( Figure 7 ) . DISCUSSION The Wcor719 gene , which encodes ADF , has been shown to be rapidly and strongly upregulated by low temperature , with greater accumulation in tolerant winter wheat and rye cultivars than in less tolerant cultivars ( Danyluk et al . , 1996 ) . Ouellet et al . ( 2001 ) detected actin depolymerization activity in the gene product and renamed Wcor719 as TaADF . Based on the induction of an active ADF during cold acclimation and its correlation with increased freezing tolerance , the protein has been suggested to be required for cytoskeletal rearrangements occurring upon exposure to low temperatures . To determine the association between ADF and the strong cold tolerance shown by D . antarctica , we performed transcriptome - based screening of the ADF gene family . Unlike most animals , which have only one or two ADF / cofilins genes , plants contain a more expanded ADF gene family ; 11 ADF genes have been verified in both A . thaliana ( Nan et al . , 2017 ) and rice ( Huang et al . , 2012 ) , and 25 genes were found in the hexaploid wheat genome ( Xu et al . , 2021 ) . We isolated eight ADF genes from D . antarctica , fewer than those found in other model plants , perhaps because we used only the transcriptome as a resource since there is presently no reference genome for this species . ADF proteins from flowering plants have been classified into four main groups to date : rice , Arabidopsis , tomato , and wheat ( Feng et al . , 2006 ; Khatun et al . , 2016 ; Huang et al . , 2020 ; Xu et al . , 2021 ) . In this study , we phylogenetically classified the D . antarctica ADF family with model plants , such as A . thaliana , tomato , rice , wheat , and maize , forming five subgroups ( A to E ; Figure 1 ) . In particular , group E was a monocot - specific clade containing TaADF and DaADF3 as the closest homologs . Similar to TaADF , DaADF3 transcription was rapidly induced by low temperature and environmental stress in the Antarctic field ( Figures 2 , 3 ) , implying that DaADF3 functions in the adaptation and colonization of D . antarctica in response to low temperature . This finding is consistent with a previous report that orthologous ADF gene pairs from the same subgroup have close evolutionary relationships and may preserve biological functions and transcriptional control mechanisms ( Huang et al . , 2020 ) . The direct regulation of low temperature - inducible AtADF5 by CBFs , representative cold stress signaling transcription factors , was recently revealed in Arabidopsis . CBF proteins FIGURE 4 | Subcellular localization of DaADF3 . The 35S : DaADF3 - sGFP fusion construct was transfected into protoplasts prepared from mature leaves of D . antarctica . Fluorescent signals of the expressed proteins were visualized by fluorescence microscopy . sGFP was used as a cytosolic marker protein . Bars = 20 μ m . Byun et al . DaADF3 - Mediated Cold Tolerance in Plants Frontiers in Plant Science | www . frontiersin . org 9 September 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 734500 bind to the promoter and turn on the transcription of AtADF5 , which is involved in regulating cytoskeleton dynamics , allowing plants to adapt to unfavorable environments ( Zhang et al . , 2021 ) . DaADF3 expression increased from the beginning of cold stress treatment , peaked at 8 h , and decreased thereafter ( Figure 3A ) . Previous studies have reported that DaCBF4 and DaCBF7 transcription was immediately upregulated and soon reduced to normal states following stress treatment ( Byun et al . , 2015 , 2018 ) . The DaADF3 promoter contains multiple DRE and LTRE elements that are possible binding sites for CBF transcription factors ( Supplementary Figure 2 ) , and synthetic oligonucleotides designed based on the DRE element of the DaADF3 promoter have shown high binding affinity to DaCBF7 ( Byun et al . , 2015 ) . Thus , we assume that DaADF3 transcription can be modulated by CBF transcription factors in the Antarctic flowering monocot plant examined in this study , and that DaADF3 further regulates actin cytoskeleton dynamics to participate in the regulation of plant adaptation to the cold Antarctic environment . However , in vivo transcriptional regulation of DaADF3 by CBF transcription factors has not yet been demonstrated . Further experiments , for example , transactivation assay using DaCBF7 and DaADF3 promoter may provide more evidence for molecular regulation of DaADF3 associated to cold adaptation of D . antarctica . DaADF3 predominantly localized to the cytosolic fraction and nucleus in protoplasts extracted from D . antarctica leaves ( Figure 4 ) . This is consistent with previous studies on subcellular localization of ADFs from wheat and cucumber ( Liu et al . , 2016 ; Tang et al . , 2016 ; Xu et al . , 2021 ) , using the ADF protein A B C D FIGURE 5 | Characterization of DaADF3 - overexpressing transgenic rice plants .

DaADF3 - Mediated Cold Tolerance in Plants Frontiers in Plant Science | www . frontiersin . org 10 September 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 734500 with C - terminal GFP driven by the 35S promoter . However , whether these GFP fusion proteins are fully functional in plant cells remains to be determined , because fusion constructs containing cofilin with GFP fused either at its N or C terminus could not complement its loss of function phenotypes in budding yeast ( Okreglak and Drubin , 2007 ) and only intramolecular ADF - GFP fusion constructs were functional in Arabidopsis pollen tube ( Zheng et al . , 2013 ) . Ectopic expression of OsADF3 in Arabidopsis enhanced its tolerance to dehydration stress , accompanied by the upregulation of several drought tolerance response genes ( Huang et al . , 2012 ) . In contrast , TaADF16 overexpression increased the freezing tolerance of transgenic Arabidopsis , possibly due to enhanced reactive oxygen species scavenging in cells . The expression levels of seven cold - response genes were found to be upregulated in transgenic Arabidopsis plants ( Xu et al . , 2021 ) . In this study , transgenic rice overexpressing DaADF3 showed increased tolerance to low temperature stress compared to WT ( Figure 6 ) and the ectopic expression of DaADF3 altered the actin cytoskeleton structure of rice plants ( Figure 7 ) . The abundance of G - actin relative to F - actin was exhibited to be higher in transgenic rice plants than in the WT , implying enhanced actin depolymerization activity in DaADF3 overexpressing plants . Furthermore , D . antarctica seedlings showed cytoskeleton structural changes in response to cold stress treatment ( Supplementary Figure 3 ) , which A B C D FIGURE 6 | Increased tolerance of DaADF3 - overexpressing transgenic rice plants in response to cold stress .

DaADF3 - Mediated Cold Tolerance in Plants Frontiers in Plant Science | www . frontiersin . org 11 September 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 734500 corresponds to the modulation of DaADF3 transcription under cold stress ( Figure 3A ) . Together , these results imply that DaADF3 regulates the cytoskeleton structure to adapt to changing environmental conditions , especially cold stress in D . antarctica . In this study , we visualized actin filament to investigate the changes of cytoskeleton in response to low temperature stimulus . As shown in Figure 7 and Supplementary Figure 3 , the ratio of G - actin to F - actin was modulated in DaADF3 overexpressing rice plants and cold stress treated D . antarctica seedling . This might be linked to the protein activity of DaADF3 , the depolymerization of actin filaments in plants . Previous studies have used chemical inhibitors of actin conformational changes , such as actin - disrupting drug latrunculin B and actin - stabilizing drug phalloidin , to elucidate their effects on actin dynamics in Arabidopsis plants in response to Pseudomonas syringae pv . tomato DC3000 ( Henty - Ridilla et al . , 2013 ) and heat stress ( Fan et al . , 2016 ) . However , the effect of these inhibitors on the cold stress response of rice or D . antarctica is still unknown . Further experiments using actin - specific inhibitor may contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the action mechanism of actin cytoskeleton dynamics of D . antactica in response to the environmental stresses . Cytoskeleton reorganization has been shown to be a major component of the signaling pathway under cold stress in alfalfa . The degrees of cell membrane fluidity affected the expression of the cold acclimation gene cas30 , as well as calcium influx , altering its resistance to freezing stress . During cold acclimation , cytoskeleton reorganization plays a key role in cold stress responses by linking cell membrane rigidification and calcium influx to enhance survival under unfavorable conditions in Medicago sativa ( Orvar et al . , 2000 ) . In a wheat thermosensitive genic male sterile ( TGMS ) line , male sterility was found to be strictly controlled by temperature . Cold stress repressed the transcription of cytoskeleton dynamic factors , resulting in defective cytokinesis during meiosis I . These findings may explain the induction of male sterility by low temperature in wheat TGMS line , and demonstrate the importance of cytoskeleton dynamics in the reproductive process ( Tang et al . , 2011 ) . Deschampsia antarctica flourishes in harsh Antarctic environment by reproducing through autogamy , with excess pollen production ( Yudakova et al . , 2016 ) . Cytoskeleton dynamics via DaADF3 may be another mechanism of action for D . antarctica reproduction , as it is one of only two flowering plants that have adapted to this environment . Due to the absence of a reference genome and limited applicable genetics tools , studies on the molecular adaptation mechanisms of polar plants are far behind those of model plants . To overcome these practical limitations , we applied a combined approach , including transcriptome analysis and plant genetic transformation , and revealed the function of DaADF3 in plant cold tolerance using transgenic rice overexpressing DaADF3 . Further molecular and physiological studies will be needed to determine whether CBF is the actual upstream activator that turns on DaADF3 transcription , FIGURE 7 | Confocal image of G - actin and F - actin in root tips of WT and Ubi : DaADF3 transgenic rice plants .
