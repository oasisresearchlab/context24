A Classroom Study of Supporting Collaborative Information Analysis using Advanced Technology Dong Chen College of Information Sciences and Technology Pennsylvania State University University Park , PA dxc360 @ ist . psu . edu ABSTRACT Collaborative information analysis involves strategic analysis and representation of complex information space through synchronous and asynchronous team interactions over extended time periods . A huge gap exists between the task requirements and supporting technology available . We developed CAnalytics , a web application that provides an integrated workspace for information collection and analysis , as well as awareness features that facilitate team collaboration . We conducted a classroom study , in which 73 intelligence analysts in training used our tool in teams of three in a crime investigation scenario . The result was mixed . Participants reported increased engagement , improved group awareness , and more efficient information organization and analysis . Meanwhile , we observed several breakdowns , exposing implications for future design . General Terms Design and Experimentation Keywords Collaborative information analysis ; visualization ; multiple coordinative views ; classroom study 1 . ACKNOWLEDGMENTS I would like to thank my advisor Prof . John Carroll for his guide and support . Thank you to Col . Jake Graham for using our tool in his course . And many thanks to Dr . Ben Hanrahan and Prof . Mary Beth Rosson for their suggestions . 2 . REFERENCES [ 1 ] Borge , M . et al . 2012 . Patterns of team processes and breakdowns in information analysis tasks .
