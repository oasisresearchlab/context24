How cells generate these actin - 39 mediated protrusions spanning lengths beyond those attainable by canonical filopodia remains 40 unknown . Through a combination of micropatterning , microscopy and optical tweezer - based 41 approaches , we found that Arp2 / 3 - dependent pathways attenuate the extent to which actin 42 polymerizes in nanotubes , limiting the formation and lengths of TNTs . Upon Arp2 / 3 inhibition , 43 epidermal growth factor receptor kinase substrate 8 ( Eps8 ) exhibited heightened interactions with 44 the inverted Bin / Amphiphysin / Rvs ( I - BAR ) domain protein IRSp53 resulting in increased TNTs . 45 In these conditions , Eps8 interaction with proteins enhancing filament turnover and 46 depolymerization were reduced . Our data suggest a shift in the equilibrium ( and usage of common 47 actin proteins players ) between branched and linear actin polymerization to form different cell 48 protrusions . 49 50 Main ( 3981 words ) 51 Intercellular communication is vital for organisms , mediating across different length scales events 52 like differentiation , tissue development / homeostasis , and wound healing . One mechanism relies 53 on filamentous actin ( F - actin ) - based protrusions ( 1 ) . Projecting a few microns from the cell , 54 filopodia dynamically probe the environment , establishing focal adhesions or cell - cell connections 55 for collective migration ( 2 ) , tissue closure ( 3 ) , and neurogenesis ( 4 ) . Contrastingly , tunneling 56 nanotubes ( TNTs ) are able to reach significantly longer distances ( tens of microns ) for direct 57 communication between distant cells ( 5 ) and appear structurally different from filopodia ( 6 ) . 58 59 First documented in 2004 ( 7 , 8 ) , TNTs are non - surface adherent , membranous extensions 60 supported by F - actin that cytoplasmically connect cells allowing the transfer of cargo ranging from 61 Ca 2 + ions ( 9 ) , RNAs ( 10 ) and plasma membrane ( PM ) proteins ( e . g . , H - Ras , Fas / CD95 ) ( 11 , 12 ) , 62 to lysosomes ( 13 ) and mitochondria ( 6 , 14 , 15 ) . This material transport ability has transformed the 63 way we think about cell identity and the establishment of cellular networks ( 16 , 17 ) . For example , 64 in vivo evidence has supported a physiological role for TNT - like structures in vascular coupling 65 within the retina ( 18 ) and in facilitating cytoplasmic and membrane - bound material transfer 66 between photoreceptors ( 19 , 20 ) , implicating nanotube - mediated maintenance in proper tissue 67 function within the nervous system . Beyond their physiological involvement in signal 68 transduction , apoptosis and immune responses ( 12 , 21 ) , TNTs can contribute to cancer progression 69 ( 15 ) , HIV - 1 and SARS - CoV - 2 transmission ( 22 , 23 ) , and the propagation of misfolded proteins 70 ( e . g . , α - synuclein , Tau , huntingtin ) involved in neurodegenerative diseases ( 13 , 24 – 26 ) . 71 72 For protrusions to form , F - actin remodelling processes ( initiation , polymerization and bundle 73 stabilization ) need to be spatiotemporally controlled at the PM in order to work against membrane 74 tension resistance to form a tube ( 27 ) . Proteins like IRSp53 ( insulin receptor tyrosine kinase 75 substrate protein of 53 kDa ) of the Bin / Amphiphysin / Rvs ( BAR ) family orchestrate membrane 76 shape changes and actin assembly in filopodia , microvilli , and dendritic spine formation ( 28 – 30 ) . 77 Through its crescent - shaped inverse BAR domain IRSp53 is able to induce , sense and stabilize 78 negative curvatures found in cellular protrusions ( 31 , 32 ) . Its CRIB ( Cdc42 / Rac interactive 79 binding ) domain permits regulatory control by Rho GTPases ( 28 , 33 ) , while its SH3 ( Src 80 homology 3 ) domain mediates interactions with actin polymerases like VASP ( vasodilator - 81 3 stimulated phosphoprotein ) ( 28 , 34 ) and the formin mDia1 ( 35 ) , and nucleating promoting factors 82 of the actin - related protein 2 / 3 ( Arp2 / 3 ) complex like N - WASP ( 36 ) and WAVE2 ( 35 , 37 ) . Thus , 83 IRSp53 self - assembly at the PM is sufficient to generate forces for protrusion growth by recruiting 84 polymerases and locally polymerizing F - actin at IRSp53 clusters ( 28 , 38 ) . 85 86 A key partner of I - BAR proteins in filopodia and microvilli formation is Eps8 ( epidermal growth 87 factor receptor kinase substrate 8 ) ( 33 , 39 , 40 ) . Eps8 was identified in a complex with Abi - 1 88 ( Abelson interactor 1 ) and Sos - 1 ( Son of sevenless homolog 1 ) that activates Rac ( 41 , 42 ) for 89 branched actin formation by Arp2 / 3 ( 43 ) . Eps8 displays actin regulatory behaviour that depends 90 on its binding partners : interaction with IRSp53 enhances Eps8’s F - actin bundling activity , while 91 binding with Abi - 1 prompts its capping activity ( 33 , 34 , 44 , 45 ) . We recently demonstrated that 92 Eps8’s actin bundling activity promotes the formation of functional TNTs in neuronal cells ( 46 ) , 93 suggesting a switch in common actin - regulating components in generating canonical filopodia 94 versus TNTs . How the cell controls a common pool of proteins to determine which actin - based 95 structure is formed is unclear . 96 97 To address this issue , we used micropatterning to control the distances over which actin - dependent 98 processes lead to TNT formation at lengths beyond those of canonical filopodia . We found that 99 Arp2 / 3 - dependent pathways deter TNTs and that upon Arp2 / 3 inhibition , F - actin polymerizes over 100 longer distances in nanotubes . Arp2 / 3 inhibition further promoted a specific interaction between 101 Eps8 and IRSp53 , and not with other I - BAR proteins , and their co - expression facilitated functional 102 TNT formation . Proteomic analysis revealed that Eps8’s interactions with branched actin networks 103 and proteins influencing filament turnover and depolymerization are reduced upon Arp2 / 3 104 inhibition . Our data show that protrusion length results from a competing balance between the 105 utilization of monomeric actin and the availability of actin regulatory proteins in order to build 106 distinct F - actin networks in a common cytoplasm . 107 108 Results 109 TNTs connect micropatterned cells at greater distances compared to filopodia 110 111 To assess TNT formation as a function of intercellular distances , we fabricated hexagonal arrays 112 of fibronectin ( FN ) micropatterns to tune the separation distance D ( Fig . 1a , b and Supplementary 113 Fig . 1a ) to be beyond the reach of filopodia which typically ranges 1 – 2 µm and rarely exceeds 10 114 µm ( 1 , 27 ) . CAD cell adherence was optimized on appropriately sized patterns to prevent 115 unwanted cell infiltration into the surrounding PEG region ( Supplementary Fig . 1b – e and 116 Supplementary Video 1 ) , ensuring that the connections we observe come from actin - driven 117 mechanisms , and not from cells that migrate apart forming TNTs through cell dislodgement ( 5 , 118 47 ) . Overnight cell tracking ( 18 hr ) confirmed that CAD cells remained resident to their initial 119 micropatterns ( Supplementary Fig . 1f , g , Example 1 and Supplementary Video 2 ) , even during 120 mitosis ( Supplementary Fig . 1g , Example 3 and Supplementary Video 3 ) , and cells rarely exhibited 121 events of inter - micropattern translocation ( Supplementary Fig . 1g , Example 2 and Supplementary 122 Video 4 ) . 123 124 We identified thin , substrate - detached TNT - like protrusions positive for F - actin connecting cells 125 on neighbouring patterns at 15 to 30 µm ( Fig . 1c , d ) , and containing DiD - labelled vesicles 126 ( Supplementary Fig . 2a ) . Using a donor - acceptor co - culture ( Supplementary Fig . 2b ) we found 127 4 DiD vesicles both in the histone 2B ( H2B ) - positive acceptor cells ( Supplementary Fig . 2c , 128 Example 1 ) and in the connecting TNTs ( Supplementary Fig . 2c , Example 2 ) supporting cargo 129 transport . After increasing D to 40 µm , we observed fewer TNTs ( Fig . 1e ) . D 15 and D 20 patterns 130 showed the highest TNT frequency , while approaching D 40 , there was a significant decrease ( Fig . 131 1f ) , indicating a distance dependency . On the other hand , filopodia lengths showed that a majority 132 of filopodia ( 90 % of the population ) were far shorter and did not exceed 6 µm with an average 133 length of 2 . 7 µm ( Fig . 1g ) . These data show that TNTs are able to reach considerably longer 134 lengths than average filopodia , yet there seems to be an upper limit to F - actin based elongation . 135 136 Inhibition of branched actin networks favours TNTs 137 138 Actin assembly can be organized into distinct architectures such as Arp2 / 3 - dependent branched 139 filaments in lamellipodia , or bundles of un - branched linear filaments . Phenotypic characterization 140 of TNT - connected cells on D 15 micropatterns revealed that cells displaying only lamellipodia 141 accounted for 4 . 1 % of TNTs examined ( Fig . 2a , b ) . In contrast , in 71 . 1 % of cases both cells 142 involved in the connection had no lamellipodia ( Fig 2a , b ) while 24 . 7 % of these TNT - connected 143 cells had a mix of cellular phenotypes ( Fig . 2a , b ) . Further analysis revealed that TNTs rarely 144 emerge directly from lamellipodia ( < 2 % of cases ) and instead originate either further up on the 145 cell body or from protrusion - rich zones ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . Together , this suggests an anti - 146 correlation between regions with high Arp2 / 3 activity and a cell’s ability to form TNTs . 147 148 We next assessed if the inhibition of actin incorporation in Arp2 / 3 - dependent networks favours 149 the formation of TNTs . Upon Arp2 / 3 inhibition with CK - 666 ( 6 , 48 ) , we observed a significant 150 increase in the percent of TNT - connected cells on D 15 , D 20 and D 30 micropatterns ( Fig . 2c ) . In 151 contrast , CK - 666 had no impact on the number of TNT - connected cells on D 40 patterns ( Fig . 2c ) 152 again suggesting there is an upper limit to the length a TNT can obtain through the polymerization 153 of actin ( Fig . 1f and Fig . 2c ) . We hypothesized that a competition between different actin networks 154 has a direct effect on the likelihood for a TNT to form over a given distance . Thus we directly 155 shifted the actin balance in favour of linear F - actin by using the formin - specific agonist drug IMM - 156 01 ( 49 ) and assessed the effect on TNTs . With IMM - 01 treatment , we observed an increased 157 number of TNT - connected cells ( Supplementary Fig . 4a , b ) and of vesicles transferred from donor 158 to acceptor cells ( Supplementary Fig . 4c ) , indicating that the promotion of linear actin networks 159 directly favours functional TNT formation . Together this data suggests that TNT formation is 160 based on the polymerization of long , linear filaments and becomes enhanced when branched actin 161 formation is inhibited . 162 163 F - actin polymerization occurs over longer distances when Arp2 / 3 is inhibited 164 165 To gain a greater insight into how TNTs can reach longer distances , we utilized an optical tweezer 166 ( OT ) setup to pull nanotubes of comparable lengths to the TNTs observed on the micropatterns to 167 monitor by confocal microscopy F - actin polymerization within the nanotube in control and CK - 168 666 - treated conditions ( Fig . 3a ) ( 38 , 50 – 52 ) . In the mock condition , cells displayed little to no F - 169 actin within the nanotubes ( Fig . 3b , c and Supplementary Video 5 ) . In contrast , CK - 666 - treated 170 cells showed a robust development of F - actin ( Fig . 3d , e and Supplementary Video 6 ) . Profiles of 171 the F - actin fluorescence showed a rapid decay of the signal in mock - treated cells where intensity 172 values were indistinguishable from background levels beyond 5 µm ; however , CK - 666 - treated 173 5 cells exhibited a shallower decay and intensities remained higher throughout the entire nanotube 174 ( Fig . 3c , e ) . 175 176 Exponential fitting of the actin profiles ( Fig . 3f ) and force measurements ( Fig . 3g , h ) confirmed 177 CK - 666 - treated cells had F - actin reaching significantly longer distances within the nanotube 178 compared to mock conditions . For example , force profiles remained static over time in control 179 conditions for actin - devoid nanotubes ( Fig . 3g ) , whereas large bead displacements ( i . e . , a rise in 180 the force , Δ F ) were observed in the CK - 666 condition ( Fig . 3h ) , indicating that F - actin 181 development had reached the end of the tube , imparting large traction forces ( Fig . 3i ) . This 182 characteristic actin - dependent behaviour has been described previously by us and others ( 38 , 50 , 183 51 , 53 ) . These data indicate that an inhibition of Arp2 / 3 activity directly correlates with the 184 polymerization of longer actin filaments . 185 186 An Eps8 - IRSp53 interaction is enhanced upon Arp2 / 3 inhibition 187 188 A shift in actin utilization upon Arp2 / 3 inhibition likely promotes interactions that outwardly 189 deform the PM and polymerize F - actin locally for TNT outgrowth . Given Eps8’s previously 190 identified TNT - promoting capability ( 46 ) , we investigated whether a specific Eps8 - I - BAR 191 interaction favours long TNT formation . We first screened Eps8’s interaction with IRTKS ( insulin 192 receptor tyrosine kinase substrate ) and IRSp53 based on their I - BAR domain sequence similarity 193 ( 32 ) and their involvement in the formation of filopodia and microvilli ( 28 , 29 , 39 , 40 ) . GFP - Eps8 - 194 wild type ( WT ) was used to immunoprecipitate endogenous IRTKS and / or IRSp53 in control and 195 TNT - promoting conditions using CK - 666 ( Supplementary Fig . 5a ) . IRSp53 precipitated with 196 GFP - Eps8 - WT in control conditions , indicating their direct interaction in CAD cells , while IRTKS 197 did not ( Fig . 4a ) . To see if the interaction is affected by Arp2 / 3 inhibition , we treated GFP - Eps8 - 198 WT cells with CK - 666 . A significant increase in eluted IRSp53 was observed , whereas no effect 199 was observed for IRTKS ( Fig . 4a , b ) . These data indicated that interaction between Eps8 and 200 IRSp53 , but not IRTKS , would favour long TNT growth . 201 202 Using spinning disk microscopy , we then characterized the process of IRSp53 - and Eps8 - driven 203 protrusions . IRSp53 and Eps8 in its bundling active form ( capping defunct mutant ; Eps8 - ΔCAP ) 204 were separately introduced in CAD cells , and the maximum length of cell - generated protrusions 205 was analysed before and after CK - 666 addition ( Fig . 4c – g ) . Prior to CK - 666 treatment ( first 30 206 min ) , IRSp53 - and Eps8 - ΔCAP - expressing cells were found to form lamellipodia devoid of 207 protrusions ( Fig . 4c , f and Supplementary Videos 7 , 8 ) or shorter filopodia - like protrusions 208 ( Supplementary Fig . 6a , b and Supplementary Videos 9 – 12 ) . After CK - 666 addition , new IRSp53 - 209 and Eps8 - positive protrusions grew two to three times longer than those found in the non - treated 210 condition ( Fig . 4d , g ) . Following CK - 666 addition , we observed an increase of IRSp53 211 fluorescence at the plasma membrane ( Fig . 4e , Supplementary Video 7 ) which then coincided with 212 the generation and growth of IRSp53 - positive dorsal protrusions , indicating a greater availability 213 of IRSp53 to generate protrusions when branched actin pathways are inactivated . 214 215 Eps8 and IRSp53 co - expression increases the formation of functional TNTs 216 217 Together the above data suggest that Eps8 and IRSp53 specifically drive long protrusion formation 218 and that their interaction is enhanced upon Arp2 / 3 inhibition . To further explore this hypothesis , 219 6 we tested the effect of Eps8 and IRSp53 co - expression on TNT formation and their ability to 220 transfer vesicles ( donor - acceptor assay ) . Stable co - expression of GFP - Eps8 - ΔCAP and IRSp53 - 221 mCherry led to a doubling in the percentage of TNT - connected cells on D 15 micropatterns ( 20 . 8 % ) 222 compared to the GFP : mCherry control cells ( 10 . 3 % ) ( Fig . 5a , b ) . Notably , TNTs found in Eps8 - 223 ΔCAP : IRSp53 cells were positive for both proteins all along their length ( Fig . 5a , inset iii ) . 224 Furthermore , vesicle transfer from Eps8 - ΔCAP : IRSp53 donors to EBFP - H2B acceptors also 225 increased ( Fig . 5c , d ) , while secretion - based transfer remained unchanged ( Supplementary Fig . 7 ) . 226 As a control we overexpressed IRTKS ( Supplementary Fig . 5b ) and showed it had no positive 227 impact on the percentage of TNT - connected cells ( Supplementary Fig . 5c ) nor on the transfer of 228 vesicles ( Supplementary Fig . 5d ) . Similarly , the co - expression of IRTKS with Eps8 - WT and Eps8 - 229 ΔCAP showed a significant decrease in the percentage of TNT - connected cells ( Supplementary 230 Fig . 5e , f ) . Interestingly , the addition of CK - 666 to Eps8 - ΔCAP : IRSp53 cells had no further 231 enhancement on the percentage of TNT - connected cells nor on vesicle transfer as compared to 232 control GFP : mCherry cells ( Fig . 5b , d ) , suggesting that the overexpression of Eps8 with IRSp53 233 may already saturate the cellular ability for TNTs to form . 234 235 Eps8 is removed from pathways associated filament turnover upon Arp2 / 3 inhibition 236 237 To analyse the actin - centric pathways through which Eps8 and IRSp53 function , GFP - Eps8 - WT 238 or IRSp53 - GFP were utilized as bait proteins in a whole - cell GFP - trap pull - down and the 239 interactomes were assessed against appropriately - treated cytosolic GFP - expressing cells ( negative 240 controls ) to identify protein hits ( Supplementary Fig . 8a ) . In the Eps8 - WT pull - down , we identified 241 36 proteins ( out of 145 ) ( Supplementary Fig . 8b ) , and the online Search Tool for Recurring 242 Instances of Neighbouring Genes ( STRING ) database ( 54 ) was used to generate association 243 networks where individual proteins were grouped into actin - based modules ( Fig . 6a ) . As expected , 244 in control conditions Eps8 preferentially interacts with IRSp53 ( Baiap2 ) , while no other I - BAR 245 proteins were identified . Consistent with Eps8’s role in membrane trafficking , several Rab - related 246 proteins were observed , e . g . , Rab5 ( 55 ) . In addition , our analysis revealed novel hits in Eps8’s 247 interactome . We observed enrichment of Arp2 / 3 complex proteins ( Arpc1b , Arpc3 , Arpc5 , Arpc5l 248 and Actr3b ) . We also noted proteins directly affecting F - actin dynamics and organization , 249 including : ( 1 ) severing proteins ( gelsolin ( Gsn ) , advillin ( Avil ) and flightless 1 ( Flii ) ( 56 ) ) and 250 phosphatases ( Slingshot homology 1 and 2 ( Ssh1 and Ssh2 ) ) that activate cofilin ( 57 ) ; ( 2 ) pointed - 251 end capping proteins ( tropomodulins 2 and 3 ( Tmod2 and Tmod3 ) ) ( 58 ) ; ( 3 ) the bundling protein 252 eplin ( Lima 1 ) ( 59 ) ; and ( 4 ) coronin 2b ( Coro2b ) that disassembles actin branches ( 60 ) . Finally , 253 we observed significant pull - down of myosin - II complex proteins , consisting of both light ( Myl6 , 254 Myl12a / b ) and heavy ( Myh10 , Myh11 ) chain proteins , unconventional myosin motors ( Myo5a / b , 255 Myo6 ) , and membrane - actin linkers ( Myo1b / c ) . 256 257 After CK - 666 treatment , 23 actin - related proteins were identified ( out of 166 ) , with several 258 overlapping hits compared to the non - treated case ( Fig . 6b and Supplementary Fig . 8b ) . Direct 259 comparison of all the proteins in the two conditions showed changes in Eps8’s interactome . Arpc5 260 disappeared upon treatment , while other Arp2 / 3 complex proteins had a fold change decrease 261 tendency ( Fig . 6c ) . Furthermore , we saw a clear change in proteins that are involved in actin 262 assembly / disassembly . Avil and Ssh1 were lost ( only found in the non - treated sample ) , while a 263 greater enrichment of actin ( Actb ) and the Cdc42 - effector proteins Cdc42ep1 ( MSE55 ) and 264 Cdc42bpa ( MRCKα ) , which promote long extensions in fibroblasts ( 61 ) and deactivate cofilin 265 7 through LIM kinase activation ( 62 ) , respectively , were present in the CK - 666 - treated sample ( Fig . 266 6c ) . Gene ontological ( GO ) analysis ( Supplementary Fig . 8d , e ) showed relative decreases in GO 267 biological processes associated with the Arp2 / 3 complex , actin filament severing and capping , the 268 negative regulation of actin filament polymerization , and vesicle - mediated transport ; no relative 269 changes were observed for pointed - end capping and F - actin bundle assembly . Together these data 270 reveal a novel ability for Eps8 to switch its association with different proteins when branched actin 271 networks are inhibited . 272 273 IRSp53 acts as a converging platform for actin - based processes 274 275 Our data show that IRSp53 cooperates with Eps8 to facilitate processes that lead to protrusions 276 obtaining lengths characteristic of TNTs . How these proteins coordinate with other F - actin 277 regulators ( e . g . , polymerases ) in this process is unclear . Therefore , we analysed IRSp53’s 278 interactome and identified 34 and 50 actin - related protein hits in non - treated and CK - 666 - treated 279 conditions , respectively ( Supplementary Fig . 9a , b ) . From these hits , direct comparison of non - 280 treated versus treated samples showed no significant difference ( Fig . 7a ) and a STRING - generated 281 network ( Fig . 7b ) shows IRSp53 has an enlarged interactome as compared to Eps8 . Like with 282 Eps8 , we found IRSp53 interfaces with the Arp2 / 3 complex and associates with proteins such as 283 Shank3 , Drebrin ( Dbn1 ) and Lamellipodin ( Raph1 ) that sculpt branched networks in dendritic 284 spines and lamellipodia ( 63 , 64 ) . However , far more WAVE and WASP proteins were observed 285 for IRSp53 ( 11 proteins ) as compared to Eps8 ( Wasf1 only ) . Unlike Eps8’s interactome , F - actin 286 polymerases like the formin delphilin ( Grid2ip ) , and those known to bind IRSp53 via SH3 - 287 mediated interactions ( 28 , 34 ) , like Vasp and Enah , were identified . IRSp53’s greater link to 288 polymerization processes appears consistent with the observation that more actin isoforms ( Actb , 289 Actc1 , Actg1 , Actl6a ) as well as profilin ( Pfn1 ) were present as compared to Eps8 ( Fig . 6 ) . 290 Furthermore , bundling proteins such as espin ( Espn ) ( 65 ) and fascin ( Fscn1 ) were noted . Overall , 291 these data show IRSp53 establishes a stable , multivalent interaction profile necessary to converge 292 and promote processes affecting F - actin polymerization ; however , we did not observe major 293 changes following CK - 666 treatment suggesting that Eps8’s interaction with IRSp53 ( which is 294 increased upon Arp2 / 3 inhibition ) switches the system towards longer actin filament formation 295 necessary for TNTs . 296 297 Discussion 298 TNTs were identified as long , actin - supported protrusions mediating direct cargo transfer between 299 distant cells ( 7 , 8 ) . This transfer function in different physiological and pathological contexts ( 5 , 300 9 , 12 – 15 , 18 – 22 , 24 , 25 ) is a key difference between TNTs and filopodia ( 5 ) . While actin is 301 ubiquitously found in TNTs , how cells develop protrusions spanning greater distances than 302 filopodia has remained unclear , and is a remarkable feat considering any TNT must rely on the 303 polymerization of cytoskeletal elements far from the cell soma where globular actin ( G - actin ) is at 304 a higher effective concentration . In this work we sought to address how actin - based structures , 305 such as TNTs , are able to achieve the lengths necessary for connecting remote cells for 306 communication and whether this process relies on unique cellular machinery . 307 308 We showed that TNT formation occurs at distances significantly higher than the average length of 309 filopodia ( Fig . 1 ) , and that Arp2 / 3 inhibition favours both TNT formation ( Fig . 2c ) and actin 310 8 polymerization over longer distances in nanotubes mechanically pulled from cells ( Fig . 3 ) . This 311 indicates that TNTs result from a balance between linear and branched actin networks ( Fig . 2 and 312 Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . These results bear similarity to reports in yeast , and in fibroblasts and 313 macrophages , where the inhibition of Arp2 / 3 , or the knockout of Arpc2 , promoted formin - driven 314 cable assembly ( 66 ) , stress fibres and filopodia ( 67 , 68 ) , suggesting different actin networks are in 315 homeostasis and compete for the same pool of polymerizable G - actin ( 69 ) . As a filopodium’s 316 steady - state length is limited by the establishment of a G - actin concentration gradient between the 317 base and the barbed ends at the protrusion tip ( 27 , 70 ) , the formation of longer filaments here for 318 TNTs could in part result from an increase in G - actin levels upon Arp2 / 3 inhibition . 319 320 Using Eps8 as an F - actin bundling protein shown to enhance TNTs ( 46 ) we identified a preferential 321 interaction with the I - BAR protein IRSp53 in CAD cells ( Fig . 4a ) that promoted functional TNTs 322 capable of vesicle transfer ( Fig . 5 ) , likely through a combined effect that promotes F - actin 323 bundling and stabilizes the nanotube’s inherent curvatures . We found that Arp2 / 3 activity serves 324 as an appreciable sink for the availability of Eps8 and IRSp53 ( Fig . 6 and Fig . 7 ) . Notably , Eps8 325 associates with Arpc1b and Arpc5L isoform - specific Arp2 / 3 complexes recently described as 326 having higher branching activity ( 71 ) . Eps8’s interaction with Arp2 / 3 is likely direct given the 327 scarcity of WAVE / WASP proteins observed in our pull - down , and that diminished pull - down of 328 complex proteins and loss of Arpc5 – which tethers Arp2 and Arp3 to the mother filament for 329 daughter filament branching ( 72 ) – was observed upon CK - 666 treatment . This contrasts IRSp53’s 330 SH3 domain - mediated ( 37 ) pull - down of far more WAVE / WASP proteins that were unaffected 331 by CK - 666 treatment . Such a scenario in which different pathways compete for reactants is 332 equivalent to a mass action dependency and is a general concept controlling receptor tyrosine 333 kinase signalling ( 73 ) to cytoskeletal network sizes ( 74 , 75 ) . Here , the reduced availability of Eps8 334 and IRSp53 when involved in branched networks diminishes their ability to drive outward 335 extension of long , linear F - actin . Indeed , upon Arp2 / 3 inhibition , an Eps8 - IRSp53 interaction was 336 enhanced ( Fig . 4a , b ) , existing Eps8 - and IRSp53 - positive protrusions further extended ( Fig . 4f , g 337 and Supplementary Fig . 6 ) and IRSp53 even re - localized to the plasma membrane driving new 338 protrusion formation and extension ( Fig . 4c , e ) . This also explains , for example , why IRSp53 339 overexpression alone partially inhibited the formation of functional TNTs in CAD cells ( 46 ) , as a 340 new steady - state favouring actin branching was likely promoted , an effect which is amplified if 341 needed TNT - factors like Eps8 are limited within the cell . 342 343 Our results show a segregation between respective areas from where lamellipodia and TNTs 344 emerge ( Fig . 2 and Supplementary Fig . 3 ) suggesting spatial segregation of different actin 345 networks is needed to form TNTs . While our study substantiates the role that competing networks 346 have on the propensity for TNTs to form , regulation of protein availability and distribution to 347 different pathways is needed . One possibility could involve 14 - 3 - 3 phospho - binding proteins 348 ( identified in IRSp53’s interactome , Fig . 7 ) which “clamp” IRSp53 in an inactive state ( 76 , 77 ) , 349 thus preventing its membrane binding , partner associations ( e . g . , Eps8 ) and hence its downstream 350 control of F - actin polymerization ( 38 ) ; however , CK - 666 treatment showed no change in 14 - 3 - 3 351 protein pull - down in IRSp53’s interactome . More likely , is through Eps8’s novel ability to switch 352 its protein and pathway associations when Arp2 / 3 activity is attenuated that results in linear actin 353 growth at longer distances ( Fig . 3 ) and promotes TNTs ( Fig . 5 ) . As observed in Eps8’s interactome 354 changes ( Fig . 6 ) , regulation of F - actin severing could be achieved through : ( 1 ) diminished filament 355 binding of barbed - end capping and actin - severing proteins ( loss of Gsn , Avil and Flii ) ; and ( 2 ) 356 9 reinforcement of processes inactivating cofilin , for example , through the loss of cofilin - activating 357 Slingshot phosphatases , and more LIM kinase activity and effectors ( Cdc42ep1 , Cdc42bpa ) to 358 deactivate cofilin . Proteins such as coronins ( e . g . , Coro2b identified in Eps8’s interactome , Fig . 6 ) 359 directly dissociate Arp2 / 3 at branching points leading to network disassembly ( 60 , 78 ) and would 360 thus modify the frictional coupling of the actin bundle within the TNT to the cortex ( 51 ) , 361 diminishing retrograde flows and thus permit more growth . Similarly , the inhibition of myosin II - 362 mediated contractility elongated microvilli through retrograde flow reduction ( 79 ) . Thus , by 363 attenuating processes that inhibit growth , the balance is shifted to processes that promote growth 364 via Eps8 - and IRSp53 - mediated interactions to directly influence F - actin polymerization and 365 bundling needed for TNTs . Our experimental work therefore reinforces in vitro reconstitution and 366 theoretical work describing the control of F - actin network sizes through a polymerase to capping 367 protein balance ( 75 , 80 ) . Finally , such a biphasic behaviour for Eps8 is analogous with reports 368 showing dendritic versus linear network antagonism is dependent upon profilin ( 81 ) , since WASP 369 ( 82 ) , formins ( 83 ) and Mena / VASP ( 67 , 81 ) all contain profilin - binding sequences , and via the 370 binding of tropomodulins to specific tropomyosin - decorated actin filaments ( 58 ) . 371 372 Altogether , our study shows that the formation of TNTs depends upon common protein players 373 and a balance between G - actin and accessory protein utilization in branched versus linear actin 374 networks . When competing Arp2 / 3 networks are inhibited , this increases the availability of 375 proteins like Eps8 and IRSp53 to exert their functions that positively lead to the extension and 376 organization of F - actin while limiting pathways that lead to filament turnover and disassembly . 377 While further studies are needed to elucidate the details of how Arp2 / 3 networks are spatially 378 separated and disassembled , and how severing proteins are controlled to thus favour TNT growth , 379 our work reinforces a general principle for actin network control for cellular protrusions where 380 simple shifts in the balance between processes that inhibit growth versus those that promote growth 381 dictate protrusion length scales . 382 383 384 385 386 387 388 389 390 391 392 393 394 395 396 397 398 399 400 401 402 10 Materials and Methods 403 Cell culture 404 Mouse neuronal Cath . a - differentiated ( CAD ) cells were used in this study and were a gift from 405 Hubert Laude ( Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique , Jouy - en - Josas , France ) .

For drug treatments prior to 414 immunoprecipitation experiments , we used 50 – 70 % confluent CAD cells that were treated with 415 50 µM CK - 666 for 1 hr . In the case of overnight drug treatments for TNT counting and co - culture 416 experiments , cells first adhered for 4 – 6 hr and were then treated with 50 µM CK - 666 or 1 µM 417 IMM - 01 for 16−18 hr . For optical tweezer experiments pre - attached cells were pre - treated for 1 418 hr with 50 µM CK - 666 .

H2B - 428 mCherry was a gift from Robert Benezra ( Addgene plasmid # 20972 ) and H2B - EBFP was a gift 429 from Michael Davidson ( Addgene plasmid # 55243 ) . 430 431 For co - expression studies , gene inserts from GFP - Eps8 - WT , GFP - Eps8 - ΔCAP and IRSp53 - 432 mCherry were PCR amplified using PrimeSTAR GXL DNA Polymerase ( Takara Bio ) and the 433 amplicons were extracted from a 1 % agarose gel ( Monarch Gel Extraction Kit , NEB ) . Inserts were 434 then cloned into a pCDH1 lentiviral vector , cut at EcoR1 and BamH1 restriction sites , using In - 435 Fusion HD Cloning Plus ( Takara Bio ) . Short Gly / Ser linkers were added between GFP and Eps8 , 436 and between IRSp53 and mCherry .

DNA : Lipofectamine 2000 complexes at a ratio of 1 : 3 450 ( µg : µL ) were added in serum - free Opti - MEM media on cells plated in 6 - well plates ( 70 % 451 confluency ) and were incubated for 6 hr before removal . Transfection efficiency was verified 24 452 hr post - transfection and transfected cells were used for further experiments . 453 454 Lentiviral particles ( LVs ) were produced in HEK 293T cells cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified 455 Eagle’s Medium ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) , supplemented with 10 % FBS ( EuroBio ) and 1 % 456 penicillin / streptomycin ( 100 u / mL final concentration ; Thermo Fisher Scientific ) at 37°C in 5 % 457 CO 2 humidified incubators . Cells were plated the day before transfection in T75 flasks ( approx . 2 458 million ) to achieve a 50 – 70 % confluency the next day . Plasmids coding lentiviral components , 459 pCMVR8 . 74 ( Gag - Pol - Hiv1 ) and pMDG2 ( VSV - G ) , and the plasmid of interest at a ratio of 4 : 1 : 4 460 ( µg ) , respectively , were transfected using FuGENE HD Transfection reagent ( Promega ) according 461 to the manufacturer’s protocol . After 48 hr , LVs were concentrated using LentiX - Concentrator 462 ( Takara Bio ) and the pellet was resuspended up to 1 mL in serum - free Opti - MEM . CAD cells were 463 plated the day before infection in 6 - well plates ( approx . 100 , 000 cells ) to achieve a 50 – 70 % 464 confluency the next day . Cells were sequentially transduced with 100 μL of the desired LVs , each 465 for 24 hr . After transduction , co - expressing cells were treated with 2 μg / mL puromycin for 3 days . 466 Double - positive cells were sorted using a BD FACSAriaIII cell sorter ( BD Biosciences ) . 467 468 Surface micropatterning 469 Micropatterning on glass coverslips was performed using an adapted method based Azioune et al . 470 ( 84 ) . Round glass coverslips ( 25 mm , No . 1 . 5 , Marienfeld ) were sequentially cleaned in a bath 471 sonicator with 70 % ethanol for 10 min and 2 % Hellmanex ( Hellma Analytics ) for 20 – 30 min at 472 30°C , and then in 1 M KOH for 20 min ; copious rinsing using ultra - pure water ( resistivity > 18 473 MΩ ⋅ cm ) from a Milli - Q Advantage A - 10 purification system ( EMD Millipore ) was performed 474 after each step . The coverslips were then dried under a stream of nitrogen and then plasma 475 activated ( Harrick Plasma ) for 5 min and then functionalized overnight in a 3 % v / v solution of ( 3 - 476 aminopropyl ) trimethoxysilane ( APTMS ) in acidified methanol ( 5 % v / v acetic acid ) . Following 477 aminosilanization , coverslips were briefly rinsed with 70 % ethanol and then annealed in a 120°C 478 oven for 1 hr . Individual coverslips were then placed on a 60 – 70 μL drop of a 100 mg / mL solution 479 of mPEG - succinimidyl valerate ( MW 5000 , Laysan Bio ) dissolved in 0 . 1 M NaHCO 3 , pH 8 . 5 and 480 left to react overnight in a humified environment to prevent evaporation . The following day , PEG - 481 coated coverslips were rinsed in ultra - pure water and stored dry in a desiccator until they were 482 used for deep - UV micropatterning . 483 484 Custom micropattern designs were drawn in CleWin ( WieWeb ) and the chrome - quartz 485 photomasks were manufactured at Delta Mask ( Enschede , NL ) . The PEG - coated coverslips were 486 held in contact with the photomask using a 2 . 5 μL drop of water ( providing an estimated spacing 487 of 5 μm ) , and the photomask was placed 5 cm away ( ~ 10 mW / cm 2 ) from the low - pressure mercury 488 lamps ( Heraeus Noblelight GmbH , NIQ 60 / 35 XL ) housed within a UV box ( UVO Cleaner , 489 Jelight ) ; coverslips were then exposed for 5 min to deep UV light ( < 200 nm ) through the 490 photomask , burning exposed regions of the PEG layer to create the desired pattern on the coverslip . 491 Subsequently , to allow for stronger covalent binding of fibronectin to the patterned areas , N - 492 12 hydroxysulfosuccinimide ( sulfo - NHS ) / 1 - Ethyl - 3 - ( 3 - dimethylaminopropyl ) carbodiimide ( EDC ) 493 chemistry for amine coupling of proteins to the surface was employed . Sulfo - NHS and EDC were 494 dissolved in 0 . 1 M MES , 0 . 5 M NaCl , pH 6 . 0 at a concentration of 6 and 124 μM , respectively , 495 and the patterned sides of the coverslips were incubated with the sulfo - NHS / EDC solution for 30 496 min . Coverslips were then rinsed with ultra - pure water , and then incubated for 1 hr with a 497 fibronectin ( FN ; Bovine plasma , Sigma - Aldrich ) solution having a total concentration of 35 μg / mL 498 ( dissolved in 0 . 1 M NaHCO 3 , pH 8 . 5 ) . The FN solution was a mixture of unlabeled and dye - labeled 499 FN , where for example , fluorescent FN typically comprised 15 % of the total FN concentration . 500 The micropatterned surfaces were stored at 4°C in PBS containing 1 % penicillin / streptomycin 501 until used for cell seeding and typically used within one week . 502 503 Fluorescent fibronectin 504 Rhodamine - labelled FN was purchased from Cytoskeleton . Labelling of FN with Alexa Fluor 405 505 succinimidyl ester ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) was performed in house . Briefly , lyophilized FN 506 ( Bovine plasma , Sigma - Aldrich ) was dissolved in PBS and dialyzed overnight against PBS to 507 remove free amines . The dialyzed FN solution was then labelled at a dye to protein ratio of 70 : 1 508 ( mol : mol ) for 1 hr at room temperature ( RT ) and in the dark to protect the reaction from light . 509 Extensive dialysis against PBS was then performed to remove free Alexa Fluor dye . The labelled 510 FN was concentrated using Amicon Ultra centrifugal filters ( Merck ) , and aliquoted and stored at - 511 80°C before use . The labelling efficiency for Alexa 405 FN was determined to be 30 . 512 513 514 Characterization and analysis of cell adherence on micropatterns 515 Reflection interference contrast microscopy ( RICM ) was performed on an inverted Eclipse Ti - E 516 inverted microscope ( Nikon ) equipped with an Antiflex 63X 1 . 25 NA oil immersion objective 517 ( Zeiss Plan - Neofluar ) and a Moment sCMOS camera ( Teledyne Photometrics ) . Light from a 518 mercury - vapor arc lamp was bandpass filtered ( 546 . 1 / 10 nm , Melles Griot ) and then directed 519 towards a filter cube containing a 50 / 50 beam splitter and two crossed polarizers prior to entering 520 the objective . An aliquot of suspended CAD cells ( ~ 20 , 000 cells ) was added on top of a 521 micropatterned substrate mounted on a Chemlide CMB 35 mm magnetic chamber ( Quorum 522 Technologies ) . Acquisition was controlled through MetaMorph and brightfield and RICM images 523 were acquired every 60 sec over 5 hr to capture as cells begin to adhere and spread on the 524 micropatterns . A reference fluorescence image of the FN micropatterns was taken at the first 525 timepoint only . RICM images were variance filtered in ImageJ / Fiji to highlight the contour of the 526 cell as the surrounding background exhibited low signal variance . Ten variance - filtered images 527 were then used as a training dataset in Weka for automatic segmentation of the contour of adhered 528 cells . Segmented images were binarized and the area was determined in ImageJ / Fiji through time . 529 530 Tracking cell confinement on micropatterns 531 Brightfield and fluorescence imaging was performed on an inverted Eclipse Ti - E or Ti2 inverted 532 microscope ( Nikon ) equipped with either a CSU - X1 or a CSU - W1 spinning disk confocal scanning 533 unit ( Yokogawa ) , a fibre - coupled Coherent OBIS laser illumination system ( 405 / 488 / 561 / 640 534 nm ) , a 40X 1 . 15 NA objective ( CFI Apochromat LWD Lambda S , Nikon ) , and a Prime 95B 535 sCMOS camera ( Teledyne Photometrics ) . CAD cells were first pre - adhered for 1 hr to the 536 micropatterns and then imaged every 5 min over 18 hr using MetaMorph or NIS - Elements ( Nikon ) 537 13 for instrumental control . Reference fluorescence images of the FN micropatterns were taken at the 538 first timepoint only . Cells in the brightfield images were segmented from the background using an 539 Ilastik - trained model resultant from a four - image training dataset . Resulting binarized images were 540 then inputted into TrackMate to track an individual cell’s centre - of - mass , with respect to the centre 541 of the cell’s micropattern , through the acquisition . Tracks were overlaid on images using “Track 542 Manager” in Icy . 543 544 Bead preparation for nanotube pulling experiments 545 Streptavidin - coated polystyrene beads ( 3 μm in diameter , SVP - 30 - 5 , 0 . 5 % w / v , Spherotech ) were 546 washed three times in a 10X volume of PBS and recovered by centrifugation ( 12 , 000 rpm , 5 min ) . 547 Beads were then resuspended in PBS to a concentration of 0 . 05 % w / v , and an appropriate amount 548 of a 1 mg mL - 1 biotin - conjugated concanavalin A ( ConA ) solution ( C2272 , Sigma - Aldrich ) was 549 added to the bead suspension assuming a binding capacity of 10 μg ConA per mg of beads . The 550 mixture was incubated overnight at 4°C on a tabletop shaker . ConA - coated beads were rinsed three 551 times according to the steps above and finally resuspended in PBS to a concentration of 0 . 5 % w / v . 552 ConA - beads were stored at 4°C and generally usable up to one month . 553 554 Nanotube pulling experiments 555 A home - built optical tweezer ( OT ) coupled to an inverted Eclipse Ti C1 Plus confocal microscope 556 ( Nikon ) was used as previously described ( 38 ) . Briefly , a 3 - watt 1064 nm Ytterbium fiber laser 557 ( IPG Photonics ) was expanded through a Keplerian telescope and directed towards the back 558 aperture of a 100X 1 . 45 NA oil immersion objective ( Nikon CFI Plan Apochromat Lambda ) . The 559 viscous drag method , including Faxen’s correction for calibration near surfaces , was used to 560 determine the OT trap stiffness which averaged 60 pN μm - 1 . Displacements of the bead from the 561 fixed trap centre were recorded on a CCD camera ( Marlin F - 046B , Allied - Vision ) at a frame rate 562 of 20 fps and videos were later analysed using a custom MATLAB ( Mathworks ) script based on 563 the “imfindcircles” function to determine the bead’s centre of mass . Forces were calculated from 564 the bead positions according to the equation 𝐹 = 𝜅 ∙ ∆𝑥 where 𝜅 is the trap stiffness and ∆𝑥 is the 565 displacement of the bead from its initial reference position determined before nanotube pulling . A 566 Nano - LP100 piezo - driven stage ( MadCityLabs ) was used for lateral XY movements on the setup . 567 A temperature and CO 2 controllable stage - top incubator ( STXG - WELSX , Tokai Hit ) maintained 568 cells at 37°C in a humidified , 5 % CO 2 atmosphere during experimentation . 569 570 The day before experimentation , CAD cells expressing EGFP - F - Tractin were seeded on 571 micropatterned coverslips in which the fibronectin patches were separated at a distance of 50 μm 572 to ensure cells were well - separated for micromanipulation . One - hour prior to experimentation the 573 phenol - containing culture medium was removed , cells were rinsed with PBS , and exchanged for a 574 phenol - free Opti - MEM medium containing : 10 % FCS , ProLong TM Live Antifade Reagent 575 ( Invitrogen ) at a 1 : 75 dilution , 2 mg mL - 1 β - Casein ( > 98 % pure , from bovine milk , Sigma - Aldrich ) 576 for surface passivation , and 50 μM CK - 666 ( or the equivalent volume of DMSO for control 577 experiments ) . The cells were taken to the optical tweezer setup and labeled with Cell Mask TM Deep 578 Red plasma membrane stain ( Invitrogen ) at a 1 : 2000 dilution for 10 min , and ConA - coated beads 579 were added ( 1 : 50 – 1 : 100 dilution ) . Using a custom LabVIEW ( National Instruments ) program to 580 control the piezo stage , membrane nanotubes were pulled by trapping an isolated floating bead , 581 bringing it into contact with the cell for a short period of time ( < 10 sec ) , and then moving the cell 582 away from the bead in the X direction . Confocal image acquisition using 488 nm ( Coherent ) and 583 14 642 nm ( Melles Griot ) lasers were controlled with the EZ - C1 software ( Nikon ) . Fluorescence was 584 bandpass filtered ( ET525 / 50 , ET665 , Chroma ) and detected using τ - SPAD single - photon 585 avalanche diodes ( PicoQuant ) that were controlled by the SymPhoTime 64 software ( PicoQuant ) . 586 Images encompassing the nanotube and some of the cell body ( typically 1024 x 512 pixels , 5X 587 zoom ) were gathered every 30 sec after pulling . 588 589 Quantification of actin profiles in pulled nanotubes 590 Image analysis was performed using custom written macros in ImageJ / Fiji . Images for the 591 membrane and actin channels were first background subtracted , and the actin channel was then 592 normalized by the average cytosolic signal measured within the cell interior to account for 593 differences in F - Tractin expression . From the membrane channel image , the nanotube’s cross - 594 section was fit to a Gaussian function to determine the ±2σ width of the Gaussian profile . Using 595 the line selection tool , a line was drawn starting within the cytosol , intersecting through the plasma 596 membrane and then following all along the length of the nanotube ; the width of the line was set to 597 the measured ±2σ width in order to encompass the entire thickness of the nanotube . Profiles were 598 then extracted and the actin intensity plotted as a function of the length of the nanotube X , where 599 X = 0 was defined as the position of the max intensity value found within the plasma membrane 600 rim near the base of the nanotube . For curve averaging , profiles were interpolated in MATLAB to 601 obtain vectors of all the same length . 602 603 GFP - trap immunoprecipitation 604 GFP - trap was performed using anti - GFP nanobody - coated agarose beads ( Chromotek ) and was 605 carried out following the supplier’s recommendations . Briefly , 1 . 2 million CAD cells expressing 606 the GFP - tagged “bait” protein of interest were plated in 100 mm dishes . The subsequent day the 607 cells were briefly washed with PBS after drug treatment , and then scraped and centrifuged at 500 608 g for 3 min at 4°C . The supernatant was gently removed , and lysis buffer was added ( 4 – 5 volumes 609 of lysis buffer for 1 volume of cell pellet ) . The lysis buffer consisted of 50 mM Tris , 1 % Triton , 610 300 mM NaCl , 5 mM MgCl 2 , cOmplete TM Mini EDTA - free Protease Inhibitor Cocktail ( Merck ) 611 at pH 7 . 4 . The cells were lysed on ice for 30 min , after which the lysate was cleared at 14 , 000 rpm 612 for 30 min at 4°C . The cell lysate protein concentration was quantified using a Bradford protein 613 assay ( Bio - Rad ) . Agarose beads were rinsed and equilibrated in PBS , recovered by centrifugation 614 and then resuspended in PBS + / + ( 1 : 1 ratio ) . After which 20 μL of resuspended beads were added 615 per immunoprecipitation ( IP ) sample ( 300 μg of total protein ) along with 300 μL of dilution buffer 616 ( 10 mM Tris , 150 mM NaCl , 0 . 5 % Triton , pH 7 . 5 ) . The IP mixture was diluted with sterile distilled 617 water , so that the final Triton concentration did not exceed 0 . 5 % v / v , and was then incubated for 618 1 hr at 4°C with gentle agitation to bind proteins . Three washes of 3 min each were carried out 619 with wash buffer ( 10 mM Tris , 150 mM NaCl , 0 . 5 % Triton , pH 7 . 5 ) . Finally , bound proteins were 620 eluted with 20 μL of 2X Laemmli sample buffer ( Bio - Rad ) and the sample was subsequently 621 denatured at 100°C for 5 min . 622 623 SDS - PAGE and Western Blot analysis 624 SDS - PAGE was performed in 1X MOPS buffer ( Sigma - Aldrich ) on Criterion 4 – 12 % precast gels 625 ( Bio - Rad ) . Wells were loaded with the total eluent volume from the IP samples , containing 300 626 µg of protein , whereas 10 % ( 30 µg ) was loaded for the lysate control samples ( input ) . The 627 migration was done at 120 mV for approximately 2 hr . Proteins were transferred ( 100 V , 1 hr ) onto 628 15 PVDF ( polyvinylidene difluoride ) membranes ( GE Healthcare Life Sciences ) using 1X 629 Tris / Glycine buffer ( in - house 50X solution containing 250 mM Tris and 1920 mM Glycine ) . After 630 transfer , the membrane was blocked using 5 % non - fat milk in 0 . 1 % TBS - T ( 1X Tris - Buffered 631 Saline , 0 . 1 % Tween 20 , Bio - Rad ) for 1 hr at RT . Primary antibodies were added at the appropriate 632 dilution , and membranes were incubated overnight at 4°C under agitation . Primary antibodies used 633 include : rabbit polyclonal anti - GFP ( 1 : 4000 , A - 6455 , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) , rabbit polyclonal 634 anti - IRSp53 ( 1 : 1000 , HPA023310 , Sigma - Aldrich ) , rabbit polyclonal anti - IRTKS ( 1 : 2000 , 635 HPA019484 , Sigma - Aldrich ) , and mouse monoclonal anti - α tubulin ( 1 : 5000 , T5168 , Sigma - 636 Aldrich ) as a loading control . Membranes were washed three times in TBS - T for 10 min and mouse 637 and rabbit horseradish peroxidase ( HRP ) - tagged secondary antibodies were added to the 638 membrane at a 1 : 5000 dilution in 5 % milk , for 1 hr at RT . Membranes were revealed using 639 Amersham ECL Prime ( Cytiva ) chemiluminescent detection reagent and imaged using an 640 ImageQuant LAS 500TM imager ( GE Healthcare Life Sciences ) . 641 642 To quantify relative changes in band intensities ( measured as an average value ) , regions of interest 643 of the same size were drawn in ImageJ / Fiji to encompass the appropriate GFP band of the bait 644 protein ( indicates the amount of eluted bait protein ) , the band of the prey protein , and background 645 values adjacent to the measured bands . Background - corrected band intensities were finally 646 normalized by taking the prey band divided by the bait band . 647 648 TNT quantification 649 On micropatterns : CAD cells were mechanically detached in serum - free Opti - MEM containing 650 0 . 5 mM EGTA ( to prevent cadherin - mediated cell clumping ) , strained through a 40 µm nylon cell 651 strainer ( Corning ) and diluted to a concentration of 175 , 000 cells / mL using Opti - MEM containing 652 10 % FBS to better ensure singularized cells . Micropatterned coverslips were generally attached to 653 the bottom of open 35 mm dishes ( P35G - 1 . 5 - 20 - C , MatTek ) using silicon grease ( Dow Corning ) , 654 and 60 , 000 cells were seeded within the volume defined by the 20 mm dish opening . Otherwise , 655 micropatterned coverslips were placed in 6 - well plates and 250 , 000 cells were used for seeding in 656 this case . After 4 – 6 hr of adherence , unattached cells were then removed manually using a pipette 657 by gently rinsing with PBS . Cells were then cultured 16−18 hr overnight prior to a two - step 658 fixation and dye staining . 659 660 Cells were fixed with 2 % paraformaldehyde ( 16 % PFA aqueous solution , methanol free , EM 661 grade , Electron Micorscopy Sciences ) , 0 . 05 % glutaraldehyde ( 25 % GA aqueous solution , Grade 662 I , Sigma - Aldrich ) , 0 . 2 M HEPES ( 1 M HEPES , Gibco ) in PBS for 20 min at 37°C , followed by a 663 second fixation in 4 % PFA , 0 . 2 M HEPES in PBS for 20 min at 37°C . Following fixation , cells 664 were quenched in 50 mM NH 4 Cl for 10 – 30 min at RT and carefully washed in PBS prior to dye 665 labelling . Alexa Fluor 647 phalloidin or Rhodamine phalloidin ( 1 : 50 – 1 : 200 dilution in PBS , 30 666 min incubation in the dark at RT ; Thermo Fisher Scientific ) was used for F - actin staining , WGA 667 Alexa Fluor 488 conjugate ( 1 : 300 dilution in PBS , 20 min incubation in the dark at RT ; Thermo 668 Fisher Scientific ) was used to stain the plasma membrane , and 4’ , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole 669 ( DAPI ) ( 1 : 1000 dilution , 2 min incubation in the dark at RT ) was used to stain the nuclei . Between 670 staining , samples were washed with PBS . Finally , samples were mounted / sealed using Aqua - 671 Poly / Mount ( Polysciences ) or Mowiol 4 - 88 ( Sigma - Aldrich ) and left to polymerize overnight in 672 the dark . 673 674 16 Samples were imaged using a 40X 1 . 3 NA oil immersion objective ( Zeiss Plan Apo ) on an inverted 675 confocal microscope ( Zeiss LSM 700 ) equipped with 405 / 488 / 561 / 640 nm lasers and controlled 676 by the ZEN software . The whole cellular volume , typically 12 µm in thickness , was imaged by 677 acquiring 0 . 4 μm - thick slices . Images were analyzed in the Icy software using the “Manual TNT 678 annotation” plug - in ( http : / / icy . bioimageanalysis . org / plugin / manual - tnt - annotation / ) for manual 679 identification and numeration of cells connected by TNTs . Connections between cells on 680 neighbouring micropatterns were annotated as TNTs if the following criteria were met : ( i ) they 681 were thin ( diameter < 800 nm ) , ( ii ) membranous and F - actin positive , ( iii ) did not contact the 682 substrate and thus would be found in the middle and upper stacks , and ( iv ) were continuous along 683 their length without obvious breaks ( e . g . , tip - to - tip bound filopodia ) to directly link the cell bodies 684 of the connected cells . The percent of TNT - connected cells on micropatterns was obtained by 685 counting the TNT - connected cells and dividing by the number of nearest - neighbour cell - occupied 686 micropatterns ( i . e . , isolated cell - occupied micropatterns were excluded since nearest - neighbour 687 micropatterns are unoccupied and thus incapable of having a TNT spanning between 688 micropatterns ) . 689 690 In normal cell culture : In Supplementary Figs 4 and 5 , 220 , 000 cells were plated into 35 mm Ibidi 691 µ - dishes ( Ibidi ) , cultured 18 hr overnight and then fixed , stained and imaged similarly to what was 692 described above for the micropatterned samples . The percent of TNT - connected cells was obtained 693 by counting the TNT - connected cells in an image and dividing by the total number of cells present 694 in the field of view . 695 696 Manual single - cell analysis of TNT origin 697 Wild - type CAD cells plated on D 15 micropatterns ( see TNT quantification on micropatterns , Fig . 698 2 ) were classified into either a mixed cell phenotype ( exhibiting hairy / filopodial and 699 lamellipodial / ruffled characteristics ) or a lamellipodia - only phenotype . Then , the immediate 700 cellular vicinity from which the TNT was originating was categorised . TNTs were categorised as 701 emanating from a filopodia - rich region , directly from a lamellipodia / ruffle region , or spatially 702 separated above a lamellipodia / ruffle region . 703 704 Quantification of vesicle transfer by co - culture assays 705 By confocal microscopy : Vesicle transfer assays such as those in Supplementary Fig . 2 and Fig . 5 706 were performed on D 15 micropatterns , while IMM - 01 drug - treated co - cultures were performed in 707 35 mm Ibidi µ - dishes ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . Donor cells were stained with DiD ( Thermo Fisher 708 Scientific ; 1 : 3000 dilution in culture media for 30 min in the dark at 37°C ) to visualize vesicles , 709 whereas cells expressing a fluorescently tagged histone 2b ( H2B ) fusion protein were used as 710 acceptor cells . Predominately , H2B - EBFP - transfected CAD cells were used as an acceptor cell 711 population unless otherwise stated . Donors and acceptors were co - cultured overnight ( 16−18 hr ) 712 at a 1 : 1 ratio ; the total amount of cells plated in Ibidi µ - dishes was 200 , 000 , while the number of 713 cells plated on D 15 micropatterns ( placed in 6 - well plates ) was 250 , 000 . In parallel , supernatant 714 controls were performed in Ibidi µ - dishes to measure secretion - based vesicle transfer . Here , equal 715 amounts of donor and acceptor cells ( 100 , 000 for Ibidi - based co - cultures and 125 , 000 for 716 micropattern - based co - cultures ) were separately cultured . After 16−18 hr , the conditioned media 717 of the donors was collected , briefly centrifuged ( 1 , 000 rpm , 4 min ) to remove dead cells , and then 718 exchanged for the media of the acceptor cell sample . The acceptors cells were then cultured for 719 another overnight incubation with the conditioned media . All samples were fixed , stained and 720 17 imaged according to the protocol described above for TNT quantification . The Icy software was 721 used to annotate acceptor cells with and without internalized DiD - positive vesicles . The percent 722 of total transfer was assessed by quantifying the number of acceptor cells containing donor - derived 723 DiD - vesicles and dividing it by the total number of acceptor cells analysed across the acquired 724 images for a given sample . 725 726 By flow cytometry : In Supplementary Fig . 5d , CAD cells expressing IRTKS - EGFP where stained 727 with DiD ( donor population ) and cultured at a 1 : 1 ratio ( 300 , 000 total cells ) with H2B - mCherry 728 expressing CAD cells ( acceptor population ) in 6 - well plates . In parallel , co - cultures using EGFP 729 expressing donor cells were used as controls . After an overnight co - culture ( 16−18 hr ) , cells were 730 mechanically detached and washed briefly with a dilute trypsin solution ( 0 . 03 % w / v trypsin in 731 PBS ) to remove non - internalized vesicles attached on the cell exterior . Cells were passed through 732 a 40 µm nylon cell strainer to separate cell aggregates and fixed in 2 % PFA . Flow cytometry data 733 was acquired with a FACSymphony A5 flow cytometer ( BD Biosciences ) . GFP , mCherry and DiD 734 fluorescence were analysed at excitation wavelengths of 488 , 561 and 647 nm , respectively . Ten 735 thousand events were acquired for each condition and data was analysed using FlowJo ( BD 736 Biosciences ) . The percent of total transfer was calculated by dividing the number of double 737 positive cells ( H2B - mCherry acceptor cells containing donor - derived DiD - vesicles ) with the total 738 number of analysed H2B - mCherry acceptor cells ( Q2 / Q1 ) . Two biological repeats were conducted 739 with each condition done in triplicate . 740 741 Time - lapse microscopy of protrusion formation 742 CAD cells at 50 – 70 % confluency were co - transfected with IRSp53 - EGFP and tdTomato - F - tractin 743 or GFP - Eps8 - ΔCAP and tdTomato - F - tractin according to the transfection protocol above . Six 744 hours prior to the acquisition , 220 , 000 of the co - transfected cells were plated in 35 mm dishes 745 ( Ibidi ) , or 250 , 000 cells were plated on 40 µm fibronectin micropatterns placed in 6 - well plates 746 ( Supplementary Fig . 6 , Example 3 ) . Samples were mounted on a Chemlide CMB 35 mm magnetic 747 chamber ( Quorum Technologies ) . Time - lapse imaging was performed on an Eclipse Ti - E inverted 748 microscope ( Nikon ) equipped with a CSU - X1 spinning disk confocal scanning unit ( Yokogawa ) , 749 a 60X 1 . 4 NA oil immersion objective ( Nikon Plan Apo VC ) , a fiber - coupled Coherent OBIS laser 750 illumination system ( 405 / 488 / 561 / 640 nm ) , and Prime 95B sCMOS cameras ( Teledyne 751 Photometrics ) for single or dual camera mode acquisition . Acqusition was controlled by 752 MetaMorph . Two positions with z - stack slices ( 0 . 6 µm thickness ) covering the 12 µm cell volume 753 were acquired at a 1 - min interval over 90 min ( except when imaging IRSp53 recruitment at the 754 membrane which was imaged with a 30 - sec interval ) . Cells were imaged 30 min prior to flowing 755 in CK - 666 at a final concentration of 50 µM , that was subsequently imaged for 60 min . A 756 humidified 37°C and a 5 % CO 2 environment was maintained in a Life Imaging Services Gmbh 757 enclosure . 758 759 Filopodia quantification and length measurements 760 For fixed conditions ( Fig . 1g ) , filopodia were quantified using the automated analysis pipeline 761 developed by Bagonis et al . ( 85 ) . Maximum intensity projection images of filopodia ( both surface - 762 and non - attached ) were created and the cell bodies were manually segmented for filopodia 763 detection using phalloidin staining . When needed , Hyugens ( Scientific Volume Imaging ) was used 764 for image deconvolution to improve filopodia detection in samples having weak actin 765 fluorescence . 766 18 For time - lapse imaging ( Fig . 4d , g ) , maximum intensity projection images were created in 767 ImageJ / Fiji . In the first 30 min of imaging ( control condition prior to CK - 666 addition ) , a 768 protrusion containing actin ( as F - tractin ) and the protein of interest was followed and when it 769 reached its maximum length ( e . g . , just before retraction ) , its length was manually measured from 770 its base to the tip . The same procedure was performed after CK - 666 treatment , with the difference 771 being that the imaging duration was increased to 60 min in order to sample length changes in 772 manually tracked protrusions . 773 774 Fluorescence profile measurements 775 The intensity of IRSp53 at the membrane ( Fig . 4e ) before and after the addition of CK - 666 was 776 analysed in ImageJ / Fiji ( “Plot Profile” plugin ) by drawing a straight line ( 10 μm long ) 777 perpendicular to the cell edge . The middle of the line was positioned directly at the boundary of 778 cell edge and the background such that individual curves could be properly aligned and overlaid . 779 780 Proteomic analysis by mass spectrometry 781 Sample preparation : CAD cells were plated in 100 mm dishes ( 800 , 000 cells ) the day before 782 transfection . Following a 24 - hr transfection , GFP - Eps8 - WT or IRSp53 - EGFP cells , along with 783 cytosolic GFP - expressing cells , were treated in parallel either with DMSO or with 50 µM CK - 666 784 for 1 hr . After washing and lysing the cells , samples were processed for GFP - trap 785 immunoprecipitation ( described above ) . After protein binding , two 3 - min washes were done in 786 lysis buffer followed by three 3 - min washes in the dilution buffer prior to on - bead digestion and 787 mass spectrometry ( MS ) analysis . Three independent preparations were performed for Eps8 , while 788 five independent preparations were performed for IRSp53 . 789 790 On - bead digestion followed by LC - MS / MS analysis : Digestion was performed strictly as 791 described by Chromotek . Briefly , beads were resuspended in digestion buffer ( 50 mM Tris - HCl 792 pH 7 . 5 , 2 M urea , 1 mM DTT and 5 µg / µl of trypsin ( Promega ) ) for 3 min at 30°C . Supernatants 793 were transferred to new vials and beads were washed twice using 50 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 5 , 2 M 794 urea and 5 mM iodoacetamide buffer . All washes were pooled and incubated at 32°C for overnight 795 digestion in the dark . Peptides were purified using a standard C18 - based clean - up protocol using 796 a Bravo AssayMap device ( Agilent ) . LC - MS / MS analysis of digested peptides was performed on 797 an Orbitrap Q Exactive Plus mass spectrometer ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) coupled to an EASY - 798 nLC 1200 ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . A home - made C18 column was used for peptide separation 799 and consisted of a 30 cm nano - HPLC capillary column ( 75 µm inner diameter ) filled with 1 . 9 μm 800 Reprosil - Pur Basic C18 - HD resin ( Dr . Maisch HPLC GmbH ) that terminated with a silica 801 PicoTip ® emitter tip ( New Objective ) . The column was equilibrated and peptides were loaded in 802 100 % solvent A ( H 2 O , 0 . 1 % formic acid ( FA ) ) at 900 bars . Peptides were eluted at 300 nL min - 1 803 using a linear gradient of solvent B ( acetonitrile ( ACN ) , 0 . 1 % FA ) from 2 % to 35 % during 55 804 min , 35 % to 60 % during 10 min , and 60 % to 90 % during 5 min ( total chromatographic run was 805 80 min including a high ACN step and a column regeneration step ) . Mass spectra were acquired 806 in the data - dependent acquisition mode with the XCalibur 2 . 2 software ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . 807 Automatic switching between MS and MS / MS scans was performed to select the 10 most abundant 808 precursor ions ( top10 method ) from the survey scan for higher - energy collision dissociation 809 ( HCD ) peptide fragmentation . Survey MS scans were acquired at a resolution of 70 , 000 ( at m / z 810 400 ) with a target value of 3 × 10 6 ions and was limited in range from 400 to 1700 m / z . HCD 811 peptide fragmentation was performed with a normalized collision energy ( NCE ) set at 27 % . 812 19 Intensity threshold for ion selection was set at 1 × 10 6 ions with a charge - state exclusion of z = 1 813 and z > 7 . The MS / MS spectra were acquired at a resolution of 17 , 500 ( at m / z 400 ) . Isolation 814 window was set at 1 . 6 Th . Dynamic exclusion was employed within 30 s . 815 816 Protein identification and quantification : MS Data were searched using MaxQuant ( version 817 1 . 6 . 6 . 0 ) employing the Andromeda search engine ( 86 ) against a reference Mus musculus proteome 818 ( 55 , 470 entries ; downloaded from Uniprot June 1 , 2021 ) . The following search parameters were 819 applied : carbamidomethylation of cysteines was set as a fixed modification , while oxidation of 820 methionine and protein N - terminal acetylation were set as variable modifications . The mass 821 tolerances in MS and MS / MS were set to 5 ppm and 20 ppm , respectively . Maximum peptide 822 charge was set to 7 and 5 amino acids were required as a minimum peptide length . At least 2 823 peptides ( including 1 unique peptide ) were asked to report a protein identification . A false 824 discovery rate ( FDR ) of 1 % was set for both protein and peptide levels . Intensity - based absolute 825 quantification ( iBAQ ) values were generated from the sum of peak intensities of all peptides 826 corresponding to a specific protein divided by the number of observable peptides . The match 827 between runs features was allowed for biological replicate only . 828 829 Statistical analysis : Proteins identified in the reverse and contaminant databases and proteins “only 830 identified by site” were first removed from the analysis . Remaining proteins with at least 2 peptides 831 were kept for further analysis and the associated peptide intensities were summed and log 832 transformed ( log 2 ) . Summed intensity values were normalized by median centering within 833 conditions ( normalizeD function of the R package DAPAR ) ( 87 ) . Proteins without any iBAQ value 834 in a condition , while present in another , have been considered as proteins quantitatively present in 835 a condition and absent in the other . Next , missing values were imputed using the impute . mle 836 function of the R package imp4p ( 88 ) . Proteins with a fold - change inferior to 1 . 5 ( i . e . , log 2 ( FC ) < 837 0 . 58 ) are considered not significantly differentially abundant between conditions . Statistical 838 testing of proteins with a FC superior to 1 . 5 was conducted using a limma t - test thanks to the R 839 package limma ( 89 ) . An adaptive Benjamini - Hochberg procedure was applied on the resulting p - 840 values thanks to the adjust . p function of the R package cp4p ( 90 ) using the robust method 841 described in ( 91 ) to estimate the proportion of true null hypotheses among the set of statistical 842 tests . The proteins associated to an adjusted P - value inferior to an FDR level of 1 % have been 843 considered as significantly differentially abundant proteins . Thus , proteins of interest are therefore 844 those considered to be present in one condition and absent in another , and those proteins identified 845 based on pairwise comparison of intensities according to the adjusted P - value and FC thresholds . 846 847 Bioinformatic analysis 848 UniProt identifiers / accession numbers of the proteins of interest ( specifically those related to the 849 actin cytoskeleton ) were inputted into the online Search Tool for Recurring Instances of 850 Neighbouring Genes ( STRING ) database ( 54 ) to generate an interaction network visualized using 851 Cytoscape . Medium confidence ( minimum score , 0 . 4 ) interactions were sourced from databases , 852 experiments , co - expression , neighborhood and gene fusion evidence . The proteins in the network 853 were grouped manually according to their function and the networks were then exported as . svg 854 files for color coding in Adobe Illustrator for easier visualization . Gene Ontology ( GO ) analysis 855 of biological processes was performed using PANTHER 17 . 0 , employing Fisher’s Exact test with 856 a false discovery rate ( FDR ) correction . The whole Mus musculus gene database was used as a 857 reference list . Output parameters for a given GO term include : 1 ) the protein count in the input ; 2 ) 858 20 a reference count ( Ref cout ) for the total number of proteins in the mouse database assigned to a 859 given GO term ; 3 ) the fold enrichment value ( observed / expected ) which is determined from the 860 protein count divided by the number of proteins expected to be annotated in a randomly generated 861 network of the same size ; and 4 ) the FDR that measures the significance of the fold enrichment . 862 863 Statistical analysis 864 Statistical analysis was performed in GraphPad Prism . P < 0 . 05 was considered statistically 865 significant and all P values are indicated in the figures . The specific statistical tests performed , the 866 number of independent experiments and the total number of samples analysed are indicated in the 867 figure captions . 868 869 Data availability 870 The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium 871 via the PRIDE ( 92 ) partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD035976 . All data needed to 872 evaluate the conclusions in the paper are present in the paper and / or the Supplementary Materials . 873 874 Acknowledgements 875 We thank all laboratory members for insightful discussions , particularly Christel Brou , Stéphanie 876 Lebrenton and Feng - Ching Tsai for their critical reading of the manuscript .
