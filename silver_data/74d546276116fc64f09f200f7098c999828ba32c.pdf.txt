So far , only chemical compounds depoly - merizing actin or stabilizing ﬁlaments , inhibiting N - WASP , Arp2 / 3 or formins , have been used to eliminate the formation of protrusions , while Rho - GTPase - dominant positive strategies have been designed to stimulate protrusions . Here we describe the design of four polyamines ( macrocyclic and branched acyclic ) , and show that they enter the cell and induce speciﬁc growth of actin - enriched lamellipodia within minutes . The largest increase in cell area is obtained with micromolar amounts of a branched polyamine harbouring an 8 - carbon chain . These polyamines speciﬁcally target actin both in vitro and in vivo . Analysis of their effects on ﬁlament assembly dynamics and its regulation indicates that the polyamines act by slowing down ﬁlament dynamics and by enhancing actin nucleation . These compounds provide new opportunities to study the actin cytoskeleton in motile and morphogenetic processes .

A ctin is involved in a variety of motile processes , including cell migration , cell division , wound healing , synaptic plasticity , immune response and host response to pathogens . The set of chemical agents available to characterize the role of actin dynamics in such processes is limited ; latrunculin A and B are known to promote ﬁlament depolymerization by sequestering G - actin ; cytochalasin D inhibits actin polymer - ization ; and jasplakinolide stabilizes ﬁlaments and blocks assembly dynamics 1 . More recent drug screening experiments have identiﬁed chemicals speciﬁcally inhibiting the protein machineries that control initiation of ﬁlaments , such as wiskostatin , an inhibitor of N - WASP 2 , CK666 , an inhibitor of Arp2 / 3 ( ref . 3 ) , and SMIFH2 , an inhibitor of formins 4 . Alternatively , to stimulate actin assembly directly , thus avoiding pleiotropic effects of G - protein signalling , we have focused on polyamines , as macrocyclic polyamines ( MPAs ) have been shown to induce massive assembly of G - actin in large structures at low ionic strength , thus being coined ‘superpolyamines’ 5 . To extend these observations further , taking into account the structural characteristics of these MPAs , we have designed acyclic branched polyamines ( BPAs ) 6 intended to mimic the features of MPAs . They present a related pattern of two triamino subunits separated by a single polymethylene chain and are of much greater synthetic accessibility , being thus more suitable for the exploration of structural diversity . Results Polyamine compounds . Four compounds with different struc - tural features were designed and synthesized ( see Methods and Fig . 1 ) : a MPA , presenting two dipropylene triamine subunits linked by two aliphatic 7 - carbon chains ( C 7 N 6 MPA ) ( Fig . 1a ) ; two BPAs containing two dipropylene triamine groups connected through the central nitrogen by a hexamethylene chain ( C 6 N 6 BPA ) ( Fig . 1b ) or a longer octamethylene chain ( C 8 N 6 BPA ) ( Fig . 1c ) ; and another BPA in which a chain of eight methylene groups connects two terminal subunits bearing additional bran - ches ( C 8 N 14 BPA 0 ) ( Fig . 1d ) to increase the density of amine groups . Additionally , a ﬂuorescent derivative of C 8 N 6 BPA incorporating a Cy3 dye group C 6 N 6 BPA - Cy3 was synthesized to allow for optical detection ( Fig . 1e ) . Universal promotion of lamellipodial protrusions . Addition of any one of the four compounds to the cell culture medium induced formation of ﬂat protrusions with an unprecedented efﬁciency and speed . The effect was observed on four different cell types ( see Fig . 2 and Supplementary Fig . S1 ) . Figure 2 shows the responses of cells in the presence of branched C 8 N 6 BPA ( Fig . 2a ) and cyclic C 7 N 6 MPA ( Fig . 2b ) ( see also Supplementary Movie 1 and 2 ) . In both cases , within 10 min , protrusions were observed extending into sheets morphologically similar to classical lamel - lipodia . The effect was more pronounced on the edges of cells already exhibiting a lamellipodial activity before the addition of the drugs . However , ectopic lamellipodia were also observed to grow at other locations . As a secondary effect of cells spreading out , neighbouring cells were able to establish contacts de novo ( see Fig . 2a , zoomed region ) . The efﬁciency of each compound in promoting the growth of lamellipodia was evaluated by measuring the increase in cell areas N NH NH 2 N N N O N NH 2 NH 2 N NH 2 NH 2 N N NH 2 NH 2 N N NH 2 NH 2 HN HN NH NH NH NH C 8 N 14 BPA ' C 7 N 6 MPA C 6 N 6 BPA C 8 N 6 BPA C 8 N 6 BPA - Cy3 a b c d e N H 2 N H 2 N N H 2 N H 2 N N H 2 N H 2 N N NH 2 NH 2 N H 2 N H 2 N Figure 1 | Chemical structures of the synthetic polyamines .

Optimal values for each circumstance were derived from the resulting three - dimensional graph ( Fig . 2c ) and the projected graphs ( Fig . 2d and Supplementary Fig . S2 ) for C 8 N 6 BPA . This way of quantifying the effect yields estimates for the efﬁciency . Note that lamellipodia growth can be modulated by nonlinear effects associated with ﬂuctuations in protein concen - trations or in feedbacks in signalling pathways . These measure - ments thus provide rough indications of the conditions for optimal effects rather than a detailed analysis of the concentration dependence of the effects of the drugs . As expected , the maximal increase was reached faster ( within 5 min ) at higher concentrations . The different compounds exhibited different behaviour in time response and in maximal increase in area ( Supplementary Fig . S2a – h ) . These data suggest that both compounds C 8 N 6 BPA and C 7 N 6 MPA engender similar efﬁciencies for growth , but at lower concentrations for C 8 N 6 BPA . This also suggests that the distance set by the length of the chain between the two terminal triamino subunits , rather than the molecular topology , determines the efﬁciency of the drug . The following assays have been carried out with all compounds and similar results were obtained . For simplicity , only results obtained with C 8 N 6 BPA and C 7 N 6 MPA are shown below . Note that we used 100 m M concentration in most of the experiments in order to promote a dramatic and saturating effect for the growth of lamellipodia ; however , lower concentrations such as 10 m M worked almost as well . To test the effect of polyamine ( C 7 N 6 MPA ) treatment on cell migration , control ( untreated ) and treated SW480 cells were seeded in a Boyden chamber with or without C 7 N 6 MPA 100 m M , and migration was assessed 24 h later ( see Supplementary Methods ) . As shown in Supplementary Fig . S3a , treatment with the actin - interacting agent could signiﬁcantly inhibit the migra - tion properties of SW480 cells compared with the control cells ( 32 þ / (cid:2) 2 cells per ﬁeld versus 62 þ / (cid:2) 12 cells per ﬁeld , Student’s t - test , P ¼ 0 . 03 ) . We then evaluated if this effect was dependent on a reduced cell viability and analysed the SW480 cell survival fraction by trypan blue exclusion after 24 and 48 h exposure to increasing concentrations of superpolyamine . Our data clearly demonstrated that colon cancer cell line survival was not signiﬁcantly modiﬁed even at the highest concentration ( 1 mM ) ( Supplementary Fig . S3b ) , suggesting that the effects of the polyamine on cell migration were not associated with cell death . Cell entry and growth promotion of lamellipodia . Upon addi - tion of the compounds , cell interaction with the extracellular matrix could be impaired , causing the formation of cell exten - sions that could differ from the canonical lamellipodia . To test this hypothesis , immunoﬂuorescence localization of focal contact protein paxillin was performed on cells treated with C 8 N 6 BPA and C 7 N 6 MPA : cells exhibited the expected distribution and shapes of focal contacts 7 , which suggest that the drugs are promoting the growth of normal lamellipodia ( Fig . 3a – c ) . a t = 0 min t = 0 min t = 10 min t = 10 min 2 2 1 1 b c Δ A r ea ( % ) T i m e ( m i n ) C o n c e n t r a t i o n ( μ M ) 100 406080 20 0 0 20 40 60 0 5 10 15 20 d 0 5 10 15 20 100 80 40 60 0 20 Time ( min ) 25 μ M 10 μ M 5 μ M 2 . 5 μ M 1 . 25 μ M 50 μ M 100 μ M Δ A r ea ( % ) Figure 2 | Polyamine compounds promote growth of lamellipodia .

All rights reserved . However , the pre - existence of cell focal contacts was not required for drug - promoted growth of cell extensions . Cells were gently detached and forced to round by incubation with a low concentration of trypsin ( Supplementary Fig . S4a – c ) ; after washing and addition of C 7 N 6 MPA , lamellipodia were promoted within 10 min , whereas control cells did not re - spread within this time period . This result demonstrates that the lamellipodium grows with de novo formation of focal contacts . The drugs could be acting on the actin cytoskeleton through an indirect mechanism , for instance by activating some upstream signalling molecule or by modifying the organization of the plasma membrane . Systematic checks were run to see that this was not the case . Repetition of the experiments in the absence of serum ( Supplementary Fig . S4d , e ) showed that within 10 min lamellipodia grew to the same extent as in the presence of serum . Further , injection of the compounds into the cells resulted in stimulation of lamellipodia in an identical manner , demonstrat - ing that : ( i ) indirect effects on the membrane were not involved ; ( ii ) the compounds entered the cell ( Fig . 3d , e ) ; and ( iii ) their effects simply resulted from their cytosolic localization . This last point was conﬁrmed using 100 m M Cy3 - labelled C 8 N 6 BPA ( see Fig . 3f and Supplementary Fig . S5 ) , which entered the cell and displayed the same effect as the unlabelled C 8 N 6 BPA . Taken together , these data suggest that the compounds penetrate the cells and promote growth of lamellipodia by targeting actin directly without the need for serum cofactors . Even though the uptake seems to be immediate , the compounds could be entering by passive diffusion or by carrier - mediated transport , as has been shown for polyamine and polyamine derivatives 8 , 9 . Strikingly , bundles of actin arranged in microspikes were observed within the lamellipodial array when C 8 N 6 BPA was added ( see Fig . 3b , white arrow , right panel ) . This feature is consistent with earlier observations of actin networks in lamellipodia 10 . We therefore sought to prove the potential bundling of actin ﬁlaments by polyamines in vitro . Promotion of bundling of actin in vitro by polyamines . MPAs have earlier been shown to induce assembly of actin into large aggregates in a low ionic strength buffer in which actin itself remains monomeric 5 . These aggregates were thought to be similar to those induced by polycations like spermine and spermidine 11 – 13 , poly - L - lysine , histones , polysaccharides and charged phospholipids ; however , the MPAs appeared much more efﬁcient in promoting actin aggregation than the large charged polyelectrolytes . The aggregates induced by cyclic polyamines were shown to be dissociated by ATP , which interacted with cyclic polyamines in competition with actin 5 . We checked that the compounds were not changing the pH in vitro in our weakly buffered solution , even at 300 m M . At physiological ionic strength ( 1 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 1 M KCl ) , cyclic polyamines ( C 7 N 6 MPA ) as well as BPAs ( C 8 N 6 BPA ) induced assembly of actin ( Supplementary Methods ) , although less efﬁciently than at low ionic strength . The assembly of G - actin in bundles of ﬁlaments was observed in a range of micromolar amounts of actin and 10 – 300 m M polyamines . It was characterized by the associated simultaneous increases in light scattering and in pyrenyl - actin ﬂuorescence ( Fig . 4a , b ) , and by electron - microscopy observation of negatively stained samples ( Fig . 4e , f ) . Finally , we observed that ATP inhibited the formation of bundles in a dose - dependent manner ( Fig . 4c , d ) . These results show that the bundling of actin occurs both in vitro and in vivo . We next probed the speciﬁcity of the compounds in vivo by using inhibitors . Lamellipodia growth without cell contractility . When acto – myosin interaction was inhibited by blebbistatin or by ML - 7 , the lamellipodia were still growing after addition of the compounds ( Fig . 5a ) . Growth was also observed when Rho kinase was inhibited by the classical Y27632 drug ( Fig . 5a bottom and Supplementary Movie 3 ) .

In contrast , the polyamine compounds had no effect when cellular actin polymerization was prevented by prior incubation with the depolymerizing drugs Cytochalasin D or Latrunculin A ( Fig . 5b ) . This suggests that a key target is indeed actin and that the ability of actin to self - assemble is required for the drug to cause lamel - lipodia extension . We next examined the effect of the compounds on well - dispersed cells on surfaces coated with high density of ﬁbronectin . Growth of lamellipodia was not recorded ; when plated on densely coated surfaces , cells were extensively spread and showed large lamellipodia . This phenomenon was associated with extensive F - actin assembly by the cells , thus depleting the G - actin source available in standard conditions . Not surprisingly , the com - pounds did not promote further extension of the lamellipodia in this situation , probably because the cells were lacking a source of available G - actin . We further examined how the dynamics and stability of actin arrays pre - assembled by polyamines were affected by the depolymerizing drugs Cytochalasin D and Latrunculin A ( Fig . 5b ) . While addition of Cytochalasin D ( 1 m M ) to C 7 N 6 MPA - pretreated cells caused disruption of actin arrays , the lamellipodia induced by C 7 N 6 MPA remained assembled upon addition of Latrunculin A ( 1 . 5 m M ) . The failure of the lamellipodial actin arrays to disassemble upon addition of the actin sequestering drug suggests that these arrays are unusually stable . Consistently , when cells were permeabilized by Triton 1 , the lamellipodial arrays induced by polyamines resembled jasplakinolide - treated cytoskeletons ( Supplementary Fig . S6 ) . We next studied the interaction between the compounds and acidic lipids . These compounds could bind lipids , thereby activating the PI3 kinase associated with lamellipodial growth . We observed that no growth was promoted when the PI3 kinase inhibitor ( LY294002 ) 14 was added ( Fig . 5c ) . However , we saw lamellipodial growth when our compounds were subsequently added . This conﬁrms the direct effect of the compounds on actin . Positively charged molecules were shown to induce the bundling of cytoskeletal polymers by neutralizing charges . We therefore checked whether the compounds were altering the organization of microtubules and intermediate ﬁlaments : no difference was observed in their organization ( Supplementary Fig . S7 ) . This further shows the speciﬁcity of these synthetic polyamines . Altogether , these results suggest that the in vivo effects of the polyamine drugs result from their functional interaction with regulated actin assembly leading to lamellipodial arrays . We therefore sought to characterize their effects on actin assembly dynamics in vitro using bulk solution assays and reconstituted motility assays . Speciﬁc retardation of barbed - end growth by polyamines . Preliminary polymerization assays performed using either light scattering or pyrenyl - actin ﬂuorescence as probes indicated that spontaneous assembly at physiological ionic strength is slowed down by polyamines ( Fig . 4b ) . Whether polyamines inhibit nucleation or elongation of actin ﬁlaments cannot be discerned by the spontaneous assembly assay . Seeded ﬁlament growth assays therefore were performed using spectrin – actin seeds and gelsolin – actin complexes , which initiate barbed - end and pointed - end growth of ﬁlaments , respectively . Figure 6a shows that barbed - end growth was speciﬁcally inhibited by about 85 % by MPA in the range 0 – 150 m M . Pointed - end growth , in contrast , was only slightly decreased in the same a P y r ene f l uo r e sc en c e ( a . u . ) P y r en y l - a c t i n f l uo r e sc en c e ( a . u . ) L i gh t sc a tt e r i ng ( 310 n m ) ( a . u . ) L i gh t sc a tt e r i ng ( 310 n m ) ( a . u . ) 120 100 80 80 60 60 40 40 20 20 0 0 198 μ M C 7 N 6 MPA 198 μ M C 7 N 6 MPA 94 μ M C 7 N 6 MPA 94 μ M C 7 N 6 MPA 0 μ M C 7 N 6 MPA 0 μ M C 7 N 6 MPA 0 : 00 : 00 0 : 00 : 00 0 : 00 : 00 0 : 00 : 00 0 : 28 : 48 0 : 28 : 48 0 : 28 : 48 0 : 28 : 48 0 : 57 : 36 0 : 57 : 36 0 : 57 : 36 0 : 57 : 36 1 : 26 : 24 1 : 26 : 24 1 : 26 : 24 1 : 26 : 24 Time ( hh : mm : ss ) Time ( hh : mm : ss ) Time ( hh : mm : ss ) Time ( hh : mm : ss ) b c d 50 50 40 40 30 30 20 10 1020 0 0 7060 1 mM ATP 0 . 5 mM ATP 15 μ M ATP 15 μ M ATP 0 . 5 mM ATP 1 mM ATP e f C 7 N 6 MPA C 8 N 6 BPA C 7 N 6 MPA C 8 N 6 BPA Figure 4 | Cyclic and BPAs induce ATP - sensitive bundling of actin ﬁlaments .

On the other hand , when barbed - end growth was initiated by the FH 1 – FH 2 construct of formin mDia1 , the half - inhibition of barbed - end assembly by C 7 N 6 MPA required a threefold higher amount of cyclic polyamine ( Fig . 6b ) , indicating that formin binding to barbed ends somehow protects them from the inhibition by polyamines . Dilution - induced depolymerization assays further showed that barbed - end depolymerization was slowed down to the same extent as barbed - end growth by C 7 N 6 MPA ( Fig . 6c ) . Although the kinetics of barbed - end assembly and disassembly were dramatically slowed down by C 7 N 6 MPA , the critical concentration for ﬁlament assembly appeared unaffected in measurements of F - actin assembled at steady state ( Supplementary Fig . S8a ) . Similar results were obtained with BPAs ( Supplementary Fig . S8b ) . As we showed that bundling was promoted by the compounds , we evaluated whether bundling was responsible for the assembly kinetics . Bundling of ﬁlaments by polyamines is less prominent at physiological ionic strength than at low ionic strength , and shows a higher concentration dependence range than the range at which extension of lamellipodia and slower barbed - end kinetics are observed . Although the involvement of bundling in the kinetic effects of superpolyamines cannot be completely discarded , the fact that the thermodynamic stability ( critical concentrations at barbed and pointed ends ) of the actin arrays do not appear modiﬁed suggests that the effects differ from those observed with bundling agents that bind in a 1 : 1 molar ratio to actin along the sides of ﬁlaments and stabilize actin arrays , like Eps8 ( ref . 15 ) or EF1alpha 16 . In conclusion , polyamines do not affect the stability of ﬁlaments but slow down their assembly – disassembly dynamics . The electrostatic nature of the effect of polyamines on barbed - end growth was demonstrated by performing seeded growth assays at various ionic strengths in the absence and presence of 100 m M C 7 N 6 MPA and in a polymerization buffer containing 1 mM MgCl 2 and increasing KCl in the range 0 – 200 mM . The percentage inhibition of barbed - end growth decreased upon increasing ionic strength and was undetectable above 150 mM KCl ( Fig . 6d ) . Retardation of treadmilling by polyamines . Actin - based motile processes result from site - directed initiation of actin assembly by two major signal - responsive protein machineries . WASP family proteins use the Arp2 / 3 complex to branch ﬁlaments at the membrane and assemble a dendritic protrusive meshwork , while formins initiate barbed - end processive assembly of actin bundles . In both cases , force is produced by barbed - end growth fuelled by regulated treadmilling . Treadmilling that drives the formation of dendritic actin arrays is enhanced by the synergistic effects of capping proteins , proﬁlin and actin depolymerizing factor ( ADF / coﬁlin ) . ADF is known to destabilize actin ﬁlaments , promoting a large increase in pointed - end depolymerization rate , the limiting step in ﬁlament treadmilling 17 . Figure 6e – g conﬁrms that gelsolin - capped ﬁlaments depolymerize up to a maximum of 30 - fold faster in the presence of ADF , in agreement with previous data 17 . The gelsolin - capped ﬁlaments are too short ( 1 m m in a b c Blebbistatin ML7 LY294002 Y27632 Blebb + C 7 N 6 MPA Cyt D + C 7 N 6 MPA LY294002 + C 7 N 6 MPA Lat A + C 7 N 6 MPA C 7 N 6 MPA + Cyt D C 7 N 6 MPA + Lat A ML7 + C 7 N 6 MPA Y27632 + C 7 N 6 MPA C 7 N 6 MPA Control Cytochalasin D Latrunculin A Figure 5 | ( a ) C 7 N 6 MPA and C 8 N 6 BPA promote lamellipodia growth even when contractility is inhibited .

In the presence of cyclic or BPAs , the rate of depolymerization was much less enhanced by ADF ( about threefold at 3 m M ADF , versus 30 - fold in the control without polyamines ) . However , a sedimentation assay showed that ADF caused the same partial depolymerization and bound F - actin similarly in all samples with and without C 7 N 6 MPA or C 8 N 6 BPA ( Fig . 6g ) . In other words , the steady state of actin assembly in the presence of ADF is practically unaffected by C 7 N 6 MPA or C 8 N 6 BPA . Finally , note that in our hands , other bundling factors like fascin did not affect the kinetics of F - actin depolymerization by ADF in vitro . In conclusion , in this assay again cyclic and BPAs slow down the dynamics of actin ﬁlaments and abolish the effect of ADF , but do not affect the thermodynamics of actin binding to ADF . Retardation of propulsion of N - WASP - coated beads . In parallel to these assays , we examined the effect of C 8 N 6 BPA on the propulsive movement of N - WASP - coated beads in a recon - stituted motility assay containing F - actin , Arp2 / 3 , ADF , proﬁlin and gelsolin 19 . Addition of 50 m M C 8 N 6 BPA a few minutes after initiation of comet tail formation caused a dramatic decrease in propulsion rate ( Fig . 7a ) . We have shown that the polyamine compounds slow down the treadmilling of actin ﬁlaments in vitro . To verify that the turnover of lamellipodial actin arrays induced by the drugs is slowed down also in vivo , we complemented these experiments by measuring the retrograde ﬂow ( Fig . 7b ) allowing proper visualization of the ﬂow 20 ( see Methods ) . Results showed that this ﬂow is decreased in the presence of the polyamines . Altogether , these data show that in vivo as well , actin turnover is slower in the presence of the polyamine compounds . This leads to the stabilization of the lamellipodial - branched array . a N o r m a li z ed g r o w t h r a t e P y r en y l - a c t i n f l uo r e sc en c e ( a . u . ) P y r en y l - a c t i n f l uo r e sc en c e ( a . u . ) N o r m a li z ed g r o w t h r a t e N o r m a li z ed depo l y m e r i z a t i on r a t e B - end g r o w t h r a t e ( a . u . ) 0 0 0 50 150 100 200 200 200 400 400 600 600 Spectrin – actin seeds 0 C 7 N 6 MPA Pointed - end growth Barbed - end growth mDia1 ( FH1 – FH2 ) 100 μ M C 7 N 6 MPA b C 7 N 6 MPA ( μ M ) C 7 N 6 MPA ( μ M ) C 7 N 6 MPA ( μ M ) c d 0 50 100 150 200 1 . 2 1 . 2 1 . 2 1 1 0 . 8 0 . 8 0 . 6 0 . 4 0 . 2 0 0 . 6 0 . 4 0 . 2 0 1 0 . 8 0 . 6 0 . 4 0 . 2 0 8 65432107 KCl ( mM ) e 3530252015105000 : 00 : 00 00 : 00 : 00 00 : 07 : 12 00 : 07 : 12 00 : 14 : 24 00 : 14 : 24 00 : 21 : 36 00 : 21 : 36 Time ( hh : mm : ss ) Time ( hh : mm : ss ) 0 ADF 0 . 4 μ M ADF 0 . 8 μ M ADF 1 . 2 μ M ADF 2 μ M ADF 3 μ M ADF 0 ADF 0 . 4 μ M ADF 0 . 8 μ M ADF 1 . 2 μ M ADF 2 μ M ADF 3 μ M ADF f 403020100 g ADF ( μ M ) kDa 0 0 1 1 2 . 4 2 . 4 3 . 4 3 . 4 0 1 2 . 4 3 . 4 P e ll e t s S upe r na t an t s 42 18 42 18 Actin Actin ADF ADF 0 Addition 0 . 3 mM C 7 N 6 MPA 0 . 3 mM C 8 N 6 BPA Figure 6 | Cyclic polyamines slow down ﬁlament dynamics at barbed ends speciﬁcally , without affecting the thermodynamic stability of the ﬁlaments .

All rights reserved . Promotion of enhanced actin nucleation in vitro . While the above data explain why the lamellipodia were stabilized by the polyamines , in vitro data do not explain how lamellipodia could be initiated by the drugs . To address this point , we performed the following experiments . The lamellipodial - branched array requires the combined actions of ﬁlament branching directed at lamellipodium tip by WAVE protein using the Arp2 / 3 complex , and other regulators like ADF and capping proteins that enhance treadmilling . We had measured that the effect of ADF was weakened by polyamines . The effect of polyamines on capping protein activity was evaluated next . Capping proteins are required to maintain an environment in which most barbed ends are capped , thus establishing a high steady - state amount of G - actin , close to Cc of pointed ends . In addition , capping proteins block barbed - end growth of ﬁlaments nucleated by branching , thus regulating their length ( architecture of the network ) and lifetime . An optimum concentration range of capping protein is deﬁned for maximum propulsion rate 21 , above which bead velocity decreases , because ﬁlament growth is arrested immediately after branching and nucleation of the daughter ﬁlament has occurred , thus generating a very densely branched and slowly growing network 19 . In solutions of pure actin , in the absence of capping proteins , critical concentration plots consist of two straight lines , indicating that a sharp transition exists at the critical concentration between the monomer and the polymer states . In contrast , barbed - end capping generates critical concentration plots that show a curvature in the region of the critical concentration , indicating that below and slightly above the extrapolated critical concentra - tion short polymers are stabilized by the capping protein , as a result of the lowered free energy of nucleation . Most barbed - end cappers including Capping Protein and gelsolin actually nucleate actin . While in the absence of capping protein , the critical concentration plots obtained in the absence or presence of BPA are strictly superimposable , in the presence of capping protein they superimpose at high actin concentration but display a different curvature in the region of the critical concentration when BPA is present . The same effect was seen when we measured the dependence of the amount of F - actin at steady state on the concentration of added capping protein , at 1 m M total actin and in the presence of BPA / MPA ( Fig . 8 ) . The data points are all above the ones observed in the control plot of data obtained in the absence of BPA , indicating that BPA stabilizes a greater number of short polymers in the presence of capping protein . The free energy of ﬁlament nucleation thus appears lowered to a larger extent with BPA than without BPA . The capping protein is in slow association – dissociation equilibrium with barbed ends . We propose that the fraction of oligomers that is not bound to capping protein at any time can therefore interact with a nucleating factor and become a stabilized growing ﬁlament . a 21 min 26 min 26 min 36 min + C 8 N 6 BPA + C 8 N 6 BPA + C 8 N 6 BPA b Control 100 s t 5 μ m 5 μ m 5 μ m 5 μ m x x 100 s t V e l o c i t y ( μ m m i n – 1 ) 2 1 . 5 1 0 . 5 00 10 20 30 40 50 Time ( min ) R e t r og r ade f l o w v e l o c i t y ( μ m s – 1 ) 0 . 04 0 . 03 0 . 02 0 . 01 0 Control * C 8 N 6 BPA Figure 7 | ( a ) Polyamines slow down the propulsive actin - based movement of N - WASP - coated beads in a reconstituted motility assay .

In other words , in the presence of capping protein , BPA would maintain a larger reservoir of potential actin ﬁlament pre - nuclei , thus facilitating ﬁlament branching by WAVE - Arp2 / 3 . These results lead to the suggestion that polyamines enhance nucleation by capping protein , thus facilitating the initiation of ﬁlament branching at the lamellipodium tip . Discussion The present results bring mechanistic insight into two different aspects of actin - based motility . First , we provide evidence that small branched or cyclic polyamines promote growth of lamellipodia in various cell types ; second , the effect of polyamines appears to be mediated by their regulation of actin nucleation and turnover in the cellular context , which sheds light on the potential mechanisms used by other cellular regulators of motility . These results offer the prospect of potential applications of polyamines as actin - speciﬁc tools in cell dynamics and medicine . We brieﬂy review these perspectives below . Polyamines are cell - permeant and their effects in vivo reproduce the effects measured in vitro on simple systems composed of actin and regulators of treadmilling , such as ADF and Capping Protein . These small size polyamines act in two complementary ways : they slow down the turnover of actin within the existing lamellipodia and they enhance nucleation of actin at the cell edge . All polyamines like poly - L - lysine , protamines and histones are basic compounds , known to cause bundling of polyelectrolytes like actin ﬁlaments 22 , 23 by neutralizing negatively charged surface residues , for example , the exposed aspartate and glutamate residues of the N terminus of actin 24 . Small branched or cyclic polyamines ( BPA / MPA ) follow this rule and cause bundling of ﬁlaments in an ionic strength - sensitive fashion ; however , they display additional peculiar properties that are responsible for their speciﬁc effects on actin dynamics . The data showing a high afﬁnity inhibition of barbed - end assembly – disassembly kinetics suggest that binding of these polyamines to the terminal F - actin subunits alters the structure of the barbed end speciﬁcally . Further experimentation using microﬂuidics allied to TIRF microscopy to study individual ﬁlament dynamics , as well as more detailed structural molecular dynamics approaches , will be essential to evaluate this possibility . Consistent with this possibility is the narrow range of distances between active groups on polyamines in which the compounds display their regulatory activity on actin dynamics . Other amino compounds like neomycin have been reported to induce lamellipodia ( for example , distribution of cytoskeletal proteins in neomycin - induced protrusions of human ﬁbroblasts 25 ) , most likely by acting on surface receptors . We have veriﬁed that up to at least 100 m M , neomycin does not induce bundling of actin at low ionic strength in vitro , while massive bundling is induced by BPA at that concentration , and does not inhibit barbed - end growth either ( Supplementary Fig . S9 ) . Hence the effects of neomycin on cell motility are unlikely to be mediated by direct interaction with actin as those observed here with branched and cyclic superpolyamines . Remarkably , lamellipodia rather than ﬁlopodia appear to be induced by BPA / MPA . This observation , which is counter - intuitive at face value , as ﬁlopodia are made of bundles and might be expected to be favoured by polyamines , is actually fully consistent with the in vitro observation that binding of formins ( which promote ﬁlopodia ) to barbed ends and successive assembly eliminate the effect of BPA / MPA on barbed - end dynamics ( Fig . 6a – d ) . The slower assembly – disassembly dynamics of pure actin in vitro , and the resulting decreased velocity of N - WASP - coated beads propelled by site - directed assembly of a Arp2 / 3 - branched actin meshwork may have implications in vivo 26 , 27 . In particular , we found that cell migration was slowed down in our assay with Boyden chambers . This is expected as motion is supported by barbed - end growth of WAVE - stimulated barbed - end assembly of an Arp2 / 3 - branched actin array . Slower migration was actually measured in a variety of cell types following up to 24 h treatment by polyamines . It is possible , however , that slower migration results in part from the effect of polyamines on actin turnover at adhesions , which is coordinated to actin turnover in protrusive structures . Along the same line , polyamines may slow down other actin - based processes dependent on regulated treadmilling , such as re - organization of the Golgi apparatus 28 , scission of tubulated membranes by WASH / Arp2 / 3 ( ref . 29 ) , dendritic spine dynamics in synaptic plasticity 30 and the dynamics of immune synapse formed in T - cell activation 31 , 32 . BPA / MPA may have an instrumental role in the kinetic analysis of other processes , such as cytokinetic ring closure , in which ADF - mediated disassembly of actin ﬁlaments contributes to contractility 33 , 34 . Similarly , analysis of morphogenetic processes characterized by ﬁnely tuned rapid dynamics of actin ﬁlaments , such as the establishment of oocyte polarity in Drosophila 35 or spindle translocation in asymmetric meiotic division , may beneﬁt from the use of BPA / MPA . Actually , in slowing down actin dynamics to desired levels , polyamines prove more manageable tools than Latrunculin A or Cytochalasin D to identify the key elementary steps . Polyamine targeting of the actin cytoskeleton represents an alternative to the use of speciﬁc reagents to block various cell functions . Polyamines are abundant in cells and have an important role in normal metabolism .

This class of compounds will probably have a number of applications both in vitro and in vivo , with strong potential as a tool to study metastasis in cancer . In conclusion , we have shown that synthetic molecules , of both macrocyclic and acyclic BPA nature , can modulate actin dynamics in cells by implementing speciﬁc supramolecular interactions . These results extend the concept of ‘superpolya - mines’ to both classes of compounds . The same approach could be used with other active groups of various geometries and distance between groups . Our work demonstrates that this approach can efﬁciently target proteins at the nanometre scale in vitro and in vivo . We anticipate and hope that this new class of compounds will be used in various situations both in vitro and in vivo . Methods Chemical synthesis of the BPAs . The BPAs were synthesized by a sequence involving : ( 1 ) treatment of terminal linear aliphatic diamines with acrylonitrile to give branched polynitriles , followed by ( 2 ) reduction of the nitrile groups to give the corresponding polyamines . The procedure for the preparation of branched polynitriles was the following 36 : acrylonitrile ( 5 . 0equiv . ) was added dropwise to the corresponding diamine ( 1 . 0eq ) dissolved in H 2 O at room temperature ( RT ) . The resulted reaction mixture was warmed up to 50 (cid:2) C and stirred for 3h . The temperature was then increased to 80 (cid:2) C and additional acrylonitrile ( 5 . 0equiv . ) was added dropwise . After 12h , the reaction mixture was cooled to RT , the layers were separated and the aqueous layer was extracted with CH 2 Cl 2 ( 3 (cid:3) 100ml ) . The combined organic layers were dried over Na 2 SO 4 , ﬁltered and concentrated in vacuo . The crude product was passed through a pad of silica ( eluant : CH 2 Cl 2 / EtOAc ) to give the corresponding nitriles as colourless oil . The procedure for the preparation of BPAs was the following : a given polynitrile ( 1 . 0equiv . ) was dissolved in a mixture of abs . EtOH and THF . Raney - nickel ( 8 . 2equiv . ) as a 50 % suspension in water was added together with 2N aqueous NaOH solution , and the reaction mixture was degassed and stirred under 1atm of H 2 at RT for 24h . The mixture was ﬁltered off through a pad of celite , washed with EtOH ( 50ml ) and the solvents were removed in vacuo . The residue was dissolved in a mixture of water ( 50ml ) and CHCl 3 ( 100ml ) , the layers were separated and the aqueous layer was extracted with CHCl 3 ( 4 (cid:3) 100ml ) . The combined organic layers were dried over Na 2 SO 4 , ﬁltered and the solvent evaporated in vacuo . The polyamines were obtained as light yellow oils . Their hydrochloride salts were prepared as follows : to the amine ( 1mmol ) in hot methanol ( 10ml ) 6M HCl ( 3ml ) and hot EtOH ( 10ml ) was added and the mixture was left at RT until a precipitate was formed . The precipitate was ﬁltered off , washed with cold ethanol and dried in vacuo . The procedure for the preparation of Cy3 dye - labelled N , N , N 0 , N 0 - [ tetrakis ( a - minopropyl ) octamethylenediamine ] C 8 N 6 BPA - Cy3 was the following : to a solution of Cy3 acid ( 30mg , 0 . 05mmol , 1equiv . ) and TSTU ( O - ( N - succinimidyl ) - 1 , 1 , 3 , 3 - tetramethyluronium tetraﬂuoroborate , 24mg , 008mmol , 1 . 6equiv . ) in DMF ( 1ml ) triethylamine ( 7 . 0 m l , 0 . 05mmol , 1equiv . ) was added . The mixture was stirred at RT for 1h . The above mixture was added to a stirred solution of N , N , N 0 , N 0 - [ tetrakis ( aminop ropyl ) octamethylenediamine ] salt ( 59mg , 0 . 1mmol , 2equiv . ) and Na 2 CO 3 ( 106mg , 1 . 0mmol , 10equiv . ) in H 2 O ( 2ml ) and the reaction mixture was stirred for 15h . The solvent was evaporated and the residue was puriﬁed by HPLC to obtain Cy3 dye - labelled C 8 N 6 BPA . The MPA C 7 N 6 MPA was obtained following the synthetic methodology previously described 37 . Cytoskeletal drugs . Polyamine compounds were dissolved in Milli - Q water to give a stock solution of 30mM . For immunostaining and microscopy experiments , polyamine compounds were added to the cell medium at a ﬁnal concentration of 100 m M , except for experiments that tested efﬁciency . For immunostaining experiments , NIH3T3 cells were incubated with blebbistatin ( 30 m M ) , ML7 ( 10 m M ) , Y27632 ( 10 m M ) , cytochalasin D ( 1 m M ) ( Sigma - Aldrich ) for 30min , LY294002 ( 50 m M ) ( Sigma - Aldrich ) for 30min . Latrunculin A ( 1 . 5 m M ) ( Sigma - Aldrich ) was added for 5min . After additional 20min incubation with 100 m M polyamine , cells were ﬁxed and stained . Actin assembly – disassembly assays . Actin assembly was monitored using as probes the increase in light scattering intensity ( 310nm , 90 (cid:2) angle ) and in the ﬂuorescence of pyrenyl - actin ( excitation 366nm , emission 407nm ) . Measurements were made at RT in a Xenius Safas spectroﬂuorimeter . CaATP – G - actin was converted into MgATP - G - actin by addition of 20 m M MgCl 2 and 0 . 2mM EGTA to a solution of 10 m M CaATP – G - actin in G buffer . Polymerization was triggered by addition of MgCl 2 ( 1mM ﬁnal ) , EGTA ( 0 . 2mM ﬁnal ) and KCl as indicated to MgATP - G - actin . The 1 : 1 CaATP – actin complex was obtained by removing free ATP by two consecutive treatments of CaATP – G - actin in G buffer with 10 % suspension vol / vol of Dowex - I ( BioRad ) in G buffer without ATP . Seeded barbed - end growth assays were performed at 2 . 5 m M actin and 0 . 1nM spectrin – actin seeds 38 . Pointed - end growth assays were performed similarly but using preformed gelsolin – actin complexes ( 2nM ﬁnal ) as seeds . The initial rate of ﬂuorescence increase was measured . Dilution - induced depolymerization assays were performed by 40 - fold dilution of a 2 . 5 m M F - actin ( 50 % pyrenyl - labelled ) into F buffer containing BPA / MPA at desired concentrations . The initial rate of ﬂuorescence decrease was measured . Critical concentration plots were performed by serial dilution of F - actin ( 10 % pyrenyl - labelled ) in F buffer containing the desired amounts of BPA / MPA . Pyrenyl - actin ﬂuorescence was read after overnight incubation in the dark . Reconstituted motility assays . Reconstituted motility assays were performed using 2 - m m - diameter carboxylated polystyrene beads functionalized with N - WASP ( 170nM , 2h , followed by 1 % BSA neutralization for 20min ) 19 . Beads were placed in a reconstituted motility mix containing 7 . 5 m M F - actin , 75nM Capping Protein , 2 m M proﬁlin , 7 m M ADF , 75nM Arp2 / 3 complex in X buffer ( 10mM HEPES , 0 . 1M KCl , 1mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 1mM CaCl 2 , 1mM ATP , 7mM DTT , 1 . 5mM DABCO at pH 7 . 8 , 0 . 5 % BSA and 0 . 2 % methylcellulose ) . C 8 N 6 BPA was then added at 50 m M . Observations were made using a phase contrast Olympus AX70 microscope controlled by MetaMorph 6 . 3r7 with CCD camera and (cid:3) 20 phase objective . Data analysis was performed to extract bead velocity with ImageJ software . Bead velocity was measured and averaged on 10 – 15 beads . Data analysis . Increase in cell area for given time point ( n ¼ 5 , 10 and 20min ) was calculated by ( A 1 n – A 0 ) / A 0 , where A 0 and A 1 n are the areas before and after polyamine addition , respectively . Kymographs for the analysis of actin retrograde ﬂow in the lamellipodia region were performed in ImageJ . Moving features were visualized as diagonal streaks with slope depending on the velocity of movement . Statistical analysis . Data are provided as mean ± s . d . Statistical analysis was carried out by using two - tailed Student’s t - test , and signiﬁcance was accepted at P o 0 . 05 . References 1 . Cramer , L . P .
