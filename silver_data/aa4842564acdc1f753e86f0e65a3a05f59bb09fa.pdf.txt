Cycles of coat assembly and disassembly are integral features of clathrin - mediated vesicular transport ( Fig . 1a ) . Coat assembly involves recruitment of clathrin triskelia , adap - tor complexes and other factors that influence coat assembly , cargo sequestration , membrane invagination and scission 1 – 3 ( Fig . 1a ) . Coat disassembly is thought to be essential for fusion of vesicles with target membranes and for recycling components of clathrin coats to the cytoplasm for further rounds of vesicle formation . In vitro , cytosolic heat - shock protein 70 ( Hsp70 ) and the J - domain co - chaperone auxilin catalyse coat disassembly 4 . However , a specific function of these factors in uncoating in vivo has not been demonstrated , leaving the physiolog - ical mechanism and significance of uncoating unclear . Here we report the identification and characterization of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae J - domain protein , Aux1 . Inactivation of Aux1 results in accumulation of clathrin - coated vesicles , impaired cargo delivery , and an increased ratio of vesicle - associated to cytoplasmic clathrin . Our results demonstrate an in vivo uncoating function of a J domain co - chaperone and establish the physiological significance of uncoating in transport medi - ated by clathrin - coated vesicles . J - domain proteins are multidomain proteins that consist of non - conserved regions and a conserved 70 - amino - acid J domain , which is homologous to bacterial DNA J 5 . Non - conserved domains bind to Hsp70 substrates , whereas the J domains interact with Hsp70 , stimulating hydrolysis of ATP . Auxilin contains a car - boxy - terminal J domain and binds to clathrin through non - con - served sequences that are amino - terminal to the J domain 4 , 6 ( Fig . 1b ) . The yeast genome encodes an open reading frame ( Ydr320c ) that is predicted to encode a 668 - amino - acid protein with a C - ter - minal J domain that shares 40 % amino - acid identity with auxilin , including the J domain signature motif HPDK ( Fig . 1c ) . However , there is little similarity in the remainder of the two proteins ( Fig . 1b ) . In contrast to auxilin , the non - conserved region of Ydr320c lacks significant tensin homology but contains three tetratricopep - tide - repeat ( TPR ) motifs , a protein – protein - interaction module that can mediate interactions with Hsp70 chaperones 7 . On the basis of the sequence similarity to the auxilin J domain and the charac - terizations that follow , we have designated Ydr320c as Aux1 . Fusions of glutathione - S - transferase ( GST ) to full - length Aux1 , or to Aux1 lacking the J domain ( amino acids 1 – 569 ) bound to clathrin in yeast - cell extracts ( Fig . 1d , lanes 2 – 4 ) , whereas a GST – Aux1 J domain ( amino acids 571 – 668 ) fusion did not ( Fig . 1d lane 1 ) . None of the fusions bound to COPII , another coat com - plex 8 ( data not shown ) . Thus , Aux1 , like auxilin , interacts with clathrin through non - conserved sequences that are N - terminal to the J domain . Aux1 , like mammalian auxilin , can bind to and assemble mam - malian clathrin into baskets ( data not shown ) . Aux1 also recruited mammalian Hsc70 to pure clathrin baskets at pH 6 . 0 ( Fig . 1e ) , although not as vigorously as auxilin . Recruitment was enhanced when Aux1 was co - assembled into baskets , indicating that co - assembly may allow the yeast protein to function more effectively in the heterologous system . This idea was supported by the fact that co - assembled Aux1 triggered efficient depolymerization of clathrin baskets at pH 7 . 0 whereas Aux1 added to preformed baskets was not active ( Fig . 1f ) . The ability of Aux1 to function as an uncoating co - chaperone with mammalian clathrin and Hsc70 in vitro provides strong evidence that Aux1 is functionally homologous to auxilin . To investigate the physiological function of Aux1 , we deleted the AUX1 gene ( aux1 ∆ ) by targeted gene replacement . Tetrad analysis of diploids heterozygous for aux1 ∆ indicated that mutant cells are viable but slow - growing ( data not shown ) . On the basis of these results , we introduced aux1 ∆ into haploid cells to generate a con - genic set of mutant and wild - type strains . Differential centrifuga - tion showed a conspicuous increase in levels of clathrin in the high - speed pellet fraction ( P3 ) from extracts of aux1 ∆ cells compared with wild - type cell fractions , indicating a possible accumulation of clathrin - coated vesicles ( Fig . 2a ) . By fractionation of medium - speed supernatant fractions through Sephacryl S - 1000 , which resolves free and vesicle - associated clathrin , we observed a redistri - bution of clathrin from free triskelion ( trimer ) to coated - vesicle fractions in the aux1 ∆ sample ( Fig . 2b , compare CHC panels for wild - type and aux1 ∆ strains ) . The ratio of coated - vesicle to trimer clathrin was increased roughly fourfold in the mutant compared with the wild type . The clathrin - associated AP - 1 subunit Apl2 ( ref . 9 ) exhibited a similar shift in elution profile ( Fig . 2b , compare AP - 1 data ) , providing further evidence of accumulation of coated vesi - cles in the aux1 ∆ strain . Elution of Apl6 , a subunit of the clathrin - independent adaptor complex AP - 3 ( ref . 9 ) was unaffected by aux1 ∆ ( Fig . 2b , compare AP - 3 data ) , indicating that the mutation does not have pleiotropic effects on other classes of coated vesicles .

Cytoplasmic adaptor protein ( AP ) complexes recruited to membranes nucleate assembly of soluble clathrin triskelia into a polyhedral - lat - tice coat ( 1 , 2 ) . Together with other factors , clathrin - coat assembly collects trans - membrane cargo proteins and drives membrane invagination . After release of the vesicle from the donor organelle ( 3 ) , the clathrin coat is disassembled to return coat components to the cytoplasm ( 4a ) , and to allow fusion of the vesicle with the target organelle ( 4b ) . The constitutive form of cytoplasmic Hsp70 ( Hsc70 ) and aux - ilin have been proposed to mediate uncoating . Other factors indicated in step 4a may also contribute to the uncoating process . b , Domain organization of auxilin and Aux1 . Significant homology is restricted to the DNA J domains ( J ) . Aux1 lacks signif - icant homology with the tensin region present in auxilin , and contains three tetratri - co - repeat ( TPR ) motifs ( amino acids 374 – 407 , 412 – 445 and 467 – 500 ) that are not present in auxilin . Aux1 also contains a single DPF tripeptide ( amino acids 3 – 5 ) , a motif that in other proteins , including auxilin , interacts with adaptor proteins 20 , 22 . c , Sequence alignment of the Aux1 J domain with other J domains from yeast , mam - mals and bacteria . Rat cyclin - G - associated kinase ( GAK ) is proposed to act as an auxilin homologue in non - neuronal cells 16 , 23 . In contrast to the C - terminal J domain of auxilin - family members , the other J domains are N - terminal . The highly conserved HPDK tetrapeptide ( underlined ) is involved in Hsp70 binding and ATPase stimulation 5 . d , Interaction of Aux1 with clathrin . GST fusions to the Aux1 J domain ( lane 1 ) , Aux1 lacking the J domain ( lane 2 ) , and full - length Aux1 ( lane 3 ) were bound to glutathione - S - transferase and incubated with non - denatured cell extract ( Ex , lane 4 ) . Bound proteins were analysed by immunoblotting with antibodies against clathrin heavy chain ( CHC ) and light chain ( CLC ) subunits . e , Aux1 induces binding of mammalian Hsc70 to mammalian clathrin baskets . The indicated concen - trations of auxilin ( squares ) or GST – Aux1 ( diamonds ) were tested for their effects on binding of 1 m M Hsc70 to 0 . 5 m M pure bovine clathrin baskets at pH 6 . 0 , condi - tions in which uncoating is inhibited 4 . Triangle indicates binding of Hsc70 to baskets polymerized together with GST – Aux1 . f , Aux1 supports uncoating of clathrin bas - kets . Clathrin release was assayed at pH 7 . 0 at the indicated times in reaction mix - tures containing 0 . 5 m M Hsc70 and 0 . 5 m M bovine clathrin baskets . At pH 7 . 0 , polymerization of stable substrate baskets requires an assembly factor , either a recombinant AP - 180 fragment ( squares , diamonds ) or GST – Aux1 ( triangles ) . AP - 180 - assembled baskets were depolymerized by the addition of 0 . 05 m M bovine aux - ilin ( squares ) but not by 0 . 15 m M GST – Aux1 ( diamonds ) . © 2000 Macmillan Magazines Ltd brief communications NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOL 2 DECEMBER 2000 http : / / cellbio . nature . com 960 structures characteristic of clathrin - coated vesicles in the mutant - cell fraction ( Fig . 2c , compare the two panels ) , which is consistent with the column - chromatography results . Cells deficient in clathrin heavy or light chains exhibit some instability in growth and protein - transport phenotypes , adapting to the absence of clathrin by as - yet - undefined mechanisms 10 . To minimize the possible pleiotropic effects of long - term growth without Aux1 , we engineered a haemaglutinin ( HA ) - epitope - tagged allele of AUX1 under the control of the galactose - inducible GAL1 promoter ( GAL1p – AUX1 ) . Galactose induction yielded a doublet of relative molecular mass 100 , 000 ( M r 100K ) of HA – Aux1 ( Fig . 3a , lane 7 ) . After the shift to glucose , steady - state levels of Aux1 steadily declined and Aux1 was essentially undetectable after 25 h ( Fig . 3a , HA – Aux1 , lanes 1 – 6 ) . Levels of clathrin heavy chain remained constant over the time course of the experiment ( Fig . 3a , CHC , lanes 1 – 6 ) . We assessed the impact of Aux1 depletion on clathrin - mediated protein transport using a diagnostic assay for trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) clathrin function — maturation of the soluble vacuolar protease carboxypeptidase Y ( CPY ) . Newly - synthesized proCPY is sorted from the secretory pathway in the TGN and directed into a pathway leading to the vacuole , the site of proteolytic maturation 11 . Rapid clathrin inactivation prevents sorting , thereby blocking con - version to the mature form 10 . As shown by pulse – chase immuno - precipitation , accumulated proCPY became apparent in GAL1p – AUX1 cells after 3 – 5 h in glucose and increased at later time points ( Fig . 3b , lanes 1 – 4 ) , indicating that Aux1 depletion impairs transport of CPY to the vacuole . In contrast , Aux1 depletion did not affect vacuolar maturation of alkaline phosphatase , which is transported to the vacuole by a clathrin - independent pathway ( Fig . 3b , lanes 6 , 7 ) . Sephacryl S - 1000 column chromatography of medi - um - speed supernatant fractions indicated co - fractionation of proCPY with clathrin - coated vesicles in mutant , but not wild - type , cell samples ( Fig . 3c , CHC , AP - 1 and proCPY panels ) .

To test further for the association of accumulated proCPY with clathrin - coated vesicles , we immuno - isolated clathrin from non - denatured extracts of Aux1 - depleted and wild - type cells and probed the resulting precipitates for CPY . Equal pre - cipitation of clathrin ( Fig . 3d , lanes 5 , 6 ) yielded an enrichment of proCPY , but not mCPY , in mutant samples compared with that in wild - type samples ( Fig . 3d , lanes 3 , 4 ) . Together , these results indi - cate that proCPY accumulated in mutant cells is contained in clathrin - coated vesicles . We examined the effects of Aux1 depletion on clathrin - mediat - ed endocytosis by analysing Ste3 , a G - protein - coupled receptor that is constitutively internalized through a clathrin - dependent pathway and is delivered to the vacuole for degradation 12 . Aux1 - depleted cells exhibited a delay in Ste3 degradation as shown by pulse – chase immunoprecipitation , indicating a defect in Ste3 transport ( data not shown ) . This defect was accompanied by a shift of Ste3 to Sephacryl S - 1000 fractions 40 – 42 ( Fig . 3c , compare GAL1p – HA - AUX1 and wild - type data ) , which contain clathrin - coated vesicles . The co - fractionation of the cargo proteins proCPY and Ste3 with clathrin - coated vesicles and the observed in vivo transport defects provide compelling evidence that Aux1 depletion causes accumula - tion of bona fide clathrin - coated transport vesicles . These results indicate that uncoating is essential for efficient delivery of clathrin - coated - vesicle cargo to target organelles in vivo . In situ analysis of clathrin distribution provided further support for the putative function of Aux1 in uncoating . Indirect immuno - fluorescence with antibodies against clathrin light chain showed a change in the distribution of clathrin after a 24 - h Aux1 depletion . Although bright patches of staining , likely to represent Golgi mem - branes , were apparent in Aux1 - depleted and wild - type cells , the general pattern of cytoplasmic clathrin staining was finely punctate in mutant cells , whereas it was weak and diffuse in wild - type cells ( compare Fig . 4a and b ) . Electron microscopy showed an accumu - lation of vesicles with diameters of 50 – 100 nm ( Fig . 4d , e ) , often with clearly visible coats ( Fig . 4e ) , in thin sections of GAL1p – AUX1 cells , which was not observed in wild - type cells ( Fig . 4c ) .

When quantified by immunogold labelling of ultrathin cryosections with antibodies against clathrin light chain , Aux1 - depleted cells were found to contain 5 . 5 - fold more clathrin - coated vesicles ( Fig . 4f – j ) than wild - type cells . In auxilin , like other J - domain co - chaperones , the J domain is required to interact with Hsp70 and stimulate ATP hydrolysis 6 , 14 . To investigate the importance of the Aux1 J domain in uncoating , we eliminated this domain by constructing a mutant truncated at residue 569 ( Aux1 ∆ J ) . Cells expressing Aux1 ∆ J grew slowly ( data not shown ) and exhibited accumulation of clathrin - coated vesicles , as shown by gel - filtration chromatography ( Fig . 5 ) . As expression levels of the mutant and wild - type forms of Aux1 were similar , the phenotypes of the aux1 ∆ J mutant indicate that the J domain is important for uncoating . Given the well - established function of J domains in Hsp70 activation 5 , these results imply that Aux1 serves as a co - chaperone for Hsp70 - mediated coat disassembly in vivo . Although the function of Hsp70 / auxilin in clathrin - coat disas - sembly has been extensively characterized in vitro , attempts to probe their physiological function in uncoating have proved incon - clusive 15 , 16 . We have provided a specific test of the hypothesis that uncoating by Hsp70 / auxilin is a critical step in clathrin - mediated vesicular transport . Importantly , our results establish three key features of this model . First , the accumulation of clathrin - coated vesicles in aux1 mutants demonstrates a requirement for a J - domain protein in uncoating in vivo ( Fig . 1a , step 4a ) . Second , the increased levels of transport - cargo intermediates in accumulated vesicles indicates that uncoating is essential for efficient delivery of cargo to target organelles ( Fig . 1a , step 4b ) . Third , the redistribu - tion of clathrin from the cytoplasm to vesicles in mutant cells shows that Hsp70 / auxilin - mediated coat disassembly is required for recycling of clathrin to the cytoplasm ( Fig . 1a , step 4a ) . On the basis of these findings , we conclude that uncoating of clathrin - coated vesicles by a J - domain - protein / Hsp70 - mediated mecha - nism is a fundamental step in clathrin - mediated protein transport in vivo . In addition to auxilin / Hsp70 , other factors , such as mem - brane phosphatidyl - inositide levels , clathrin light chains and adaptor complexes , have been implicated in regulation of uncoat - ing as well as vesicle formation 1 – 3 , 17 – 22 . Thus , uncoating is likely to involve concerted participation of proteins that act either on the clathrin lattice or on the underlying adaptor complexes and mem - brane . With molecular and genetic probes for uncoating in yeast , it should now be possible to investigate the specific function of dif - ferent factors in coat disassembly , thereby facilitating the defini - tion of the in vivo uncoating mechanism . Methods GST - fusion affinity chromatography . To construct GST – Aux1 fusions , DNA fragments encoding full - length Aux1 ( amino acids 1 – 668 ) , Aux1 with the J domain deleted ( amino acids 1 – 569 ) , or the Aux1 J domain alone ( amino acids 571 – 668 ) were amplified from genomic DNA by polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) , cloned , expressed , purified , and used for affinity chromatography of yeast - cell extracts as described 9 , with minor modifi - cations . Primer sequences are available on request . In vitro methods . Binding of Hsc70 to clathrin baskets and ATP - dependent uncoating were assayed as described 23 , except that a histidine - tagged C - terminal fragment of AP - 180 ( M r 58K ) was used instead of full - length AP - 180 . Full - length GST – Aux1 was purified from Escherichia coli by glutathione – agarose chromatography . Strains . AUX1 , from 15 nucleotides downstream of the initiation codon to 3 nucleotides upstream of the ter - mination codon , was replaced with TRP1 using a PCR - based variation of single - step gene replace - ment 24 in strain SEY6210 ( MAT a ura3 leu2 his3 trp1 lys2 suc2 ) . The GAL1 promoter and three tandem N - terminal HA - epitope tags were introduced into the chromosomal YDR320c locus of FY - 1679 - 18B ( MAT a ura3 leu2 his3 trp1 ) as described 25 , using HIS3 as a selectable marker . The aux1 ∆ J allele was similarly generated by truncation ( at amino acid 571 ) of GAL1 – AUX1 in FY - 1679 - 18B , using TRP1 as a selectable marker . Primer sequences are available on request . Differential fractionation and gel - filtration chromatography . Cells ( 5 · 10 8 ) grown at 24 (cid:176) C in YP medium ( 1 % Difco Bacto - yeast extract and 2 % Bactopeptone ) with either 2 % glucose or galactose were converted to spheroplasts and lysed in coated - vesicle - stabiliz - ing buffer ( buffer A ) as described 21 . Extracts were subjected to consecutive centrifugation at 1 , 500 g for 5 min to obtain S1 and P1 , 16 , 000 g for 30 min to obtain S2 and P2 , and 256 , 000 g for 15 min to obtain S3 and P3 . To assess the relative distribution of clathrin between vesicle and soluble fractions , an ana - lytic assay was developed in which a differential - centrifugation S2 fraction ( 26 , 000 g for 30 min ) from 5 · 10 9 cells was chromatographed through a 1 . 5 cm · 120 cm column of Sephacryl S - 1000 . Fractions ( 3 ml ) were collected , precipitated with 10 % trichloroacetic acid and analysed by SDS – PAGE and immunoblotting . Immunoprecipitation . For pulse – chase immunoprecipitations , cells were grown at 24 (cid:176) C in synthetic medium ( 0 . 67 % Difco yeast nitrogen base plus 2 % Bacto - yeast extract , supplemented as needed with appropriate amino acids and uracil ) with either 2 % glucose or galactose . Labelling and immunoprecipitation were carried out as described 10 , except that internal and external fractions were not separated before lysis . Immunoisolation of clathrin from non - denatured extracts was carried out as described 21 , except that Triton X - 100 was absent and extracts were prepared in buffer A . Microscopy . Cells were fixed and processed for immunofluorescence as described 26 using primary rabbit anti - clathrin light chain antibodies and anti - rabbit Alexa488 ( Molecular Probes ) secondary antibodies . Images were obtained using a Fluoview laser - scanning confocal microscope ( Olympus America , { AU : town and state ? } ) equipped with a krypton - argon laser . Negative staining of vesicle fractions 27 , trans - mission electron microscopy and immunogold labelling of ultrathin cryosections 28 , 29 were carried out as described . As controls for specificity , no labelling of clc1 ∆ cells was observed by immunofluores - cence or immunogold labelling . For quantification of negative - stained vesicles , coated vesicles were counted in 25 , 000 - fold magnifications of 16 randomly - chosen fields each of wild - type and mutant cells . For quantification of immunogold labelling , vesicles in 19 cell sections were scored for Aux1 - depleted and wild - type cells . In mutant cells 45 vesicles were labelled with 331 5 - nm gold particles , whereas in wild - type cells a total of 8 vesicles were labelled with 54 gold particles . These numbers give 2 . 3 vesicles per mutant cell with 7 . 3 particles per vesicle and 0 . 42 vesicles per wild - type cell with 6 . 75 particles per vesicle . Sequence analysis . A homology search was carried out using the BLAST algorithm 30 . J domains were aligned with CLUSTAL 31 and TPR motifs were identified using the Pfam database 32 .
