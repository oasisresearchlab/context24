Studies on the action of SPRY2 in major cancers are conflicting and its role remains unclear . Here we have dissected SPRY2 action in human colon cancer . Global transcriptomic analyses show that SPRY2 downregulates genes encoding tight junction proteins such as claudin - 7 and occludin and other cell - to - cell and cell - to - matrix adhesion molecules in human SW480 - ADH colon carcinoma cells . Moreover , SPRY2 represses LLGLL2 / HUGL2 , PATJ1 / INADL and ST14 , main regulators of the polarized epithelial phenotype , and ESRP1 , an epithelial - to - mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) inhibitor . A key action of SPRY2 is the upregulation of the major EMT inducer ZEB1 , as these effects are reversed by ZEB1 knock - down by means of RNA interference . Consistently , we found an inverse correlation between the expression level of claudin - 7 and those of SPRY2 and ZEB1 in human colon tumors . Mechanistically , ZEB1 upregulation by SPRY2 results from the combined induction of ETS1 transcription factor and the repression of microRNAs ( miR - 200 family , miR - 150 ) that target ZEB1 RNA . Moreover , SPRY2 increased AKT activation by epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) whereas AKT and also Src inhibition reduced the induction of ZEB1 . Altogether , these data suggest that AKT and Src are implicated in SPRY2 action . Collectively , these results show a tumorigenic role of SPRY2 in colon cancer that is based on the dysregulation of tight junction and epithelial polarity master genes via upregulation of ZEB1 . The dissection of the mechanism of action of SPRY2 in colon cancer cells is important to understand the upregulation of this gene in a subset of patients with this neoplasia that have poor prognosis . Keywords : SPROUTY - 2 , colon cancer , ZEB1 , AKT , ETS1 , claudin - 7 3 INTRODUCTION SPROUTY - 2 ( SPRY2 ) belongs to a family of intracellular modulators of tyrosine kinase receptor signaling . 1 , 2 SPRY2 action is receptor - and cell type - dependent : it inhibits signaling by activated fibroblast growth factor receptor ( FGFR ) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor ( VEGF ) whereas it increases signaling by epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) in some cell types . 3 , 4 The underlying mechanisms include the inhibition of EGFR ubiquitination - dependent degradation and trafficking from early to late endosomes . 5 , 6 Given the important role of EGFR and FGFRs on the biology of many epithelial cell types and as therapeutic targets in carcinomas and other cancers , SPRY2 is drawing increasing attention . However , the role of SPRY2 in cancer remains unclear . 2 In colon cancer , we have previously reported SPRY2 upregulation in high - grade tumors and at the invasion front of low - grade tumors . 7 Likewise , SPRY2 RNA and protein levels are higher in colon adenocarcinomas than in normal adjacent mucosa . 8 In SW480 - ADH colon cancer cells SPRY2 represses CDH1 / E - cadherin and counteracts the adhesive phenotype induced by 1 α , 25 - dihydroxyvitamin D 3 . 7 Moreover , in HT - 29 and LS - 174T cells SPRY2 increases the level of c - MET and HGF - stimulated ERK and AKT phosphorylation , promoting cell migration and invasion . 8 Further supporting a tumorigenic role , SPRY2 is upregulated in KRAS mutant colorectal cancer , 9 and in melanoma cells harbouring N - RAS or B - RAF mutations . 10 , 11 RNA expression repository databases show upregulation of SPRY2 expression in colorectal tumors versus others neoplasias . 12 Consistently , we have recently shown that SPRY2 is a target of β - catenin / FOXO3a , a marker of poor prognosis in colon cancer . 13 In contrast , lower levels of SPRY2 RNA have been reported in tumor versus normal tissue and in stage III / IV versus stage II colon cancer patients , as well as inhibitory effects of exogenous SPRY2 4 overexpression on the proliferation , migration and tumorigenic potential of HCT116 colon cancer cells xenografted in immunodeficient mice . 14 Also , SPRY2 appears to have tumor suppressive effects in breast , prostate , and liver cancers and in B - cell diffuse lymphoma . 15 - 19 These opposite effects are indicative of cell - type - dependent activities of SPRY2 . 2 To dissect the action of SPRY2 in colon cancer , we analyzed its effects on gene expression and phenotype of SW480 - ADH cells . Transcriptomic analyses revealed the repression by SPRY2 of genes encoding proteins involved in cell - to - cell and cell - to - matrix adhesion or regulating epithelial cell polarity such as ST14 , which codes for the membrane - anchored serine protease matriptase that is essential for the integrity of the intestinal epithelial barrier . 20 We show that most of the gene regulatory effects of SPRY2 are mediated by ZEB1 , a major epithelial - to - mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) inducer . Thus , SPRY2 is a potent inhibitor of the epithelial phenotype in colon carcinoma cells by repressing tight junction and polarity regulators through the upregulation of ZEB1 , which in turn results from the induction of the transcription factor ETS1 and the downregulation of micro ( mi ) RNAs ( miR200 family , miR - 150 ) that target ZEB1 RNA . 5 RESULTS SPRY2 represses epithelial adhesion and polarity genes To characterize the effects and dissect the mechanism of action of SPRY2 in colon carcinoma cells we generated SW480 - ADH cells ( containing low level of endogenous SPRY2 protein ) stably expressing a wild type ( AU5 - tagged ) SPRY2 ( SPRY2 - wt cells ) . We also generated cells expressing mutant S112A ( SPRY2 - S112A cells ) or Y55F ( SPRY2 - Y55F cells ) SPRY2 proteins , which respectively lack the phosphorylation site for Mnk1 / 2 kinases ( Ser 112 ) or a tyrosine residue ( Tyr 55 ) thought to be required for the interaction with c - Cbl and thus for potentiation of EGFR stability as well as for full FGF inhibitory activity . 21 - 24 Empty vector transfected cells ( Mock ) were used as control . All cell types had a similar polygonal morphology except SPRY2 - Y55F cells that appeared more elongated ( Figure 1a , left ) . Expression of exogenous SPRY2 proteins was confirmed by Western blot ( Figure 1a , right ) . To get insight into the mechanisms through which SPRY2 impacts on gene expression , we carried out a global transcriptomic analysis of the four transfectants . High correlation was observed between replicates ( Supplementary Table 1 ) , while SPRY2 - wt and SPRY2 - S112A have the lowest correlations between conditions . Samples were unambiguously clusterized by transfected type in a Principal Component Analysis ( PCA ) explaining most of the variance ( 99 , 7 % ) ( Supplementary Figure S1 ) . Furthermore , Single Enrichment Analysis ( SEA ) with differentially expressed transcripts ( Supplementary Table 2 ) showed that genes related with cell - to - cell and cell - to - matrix adhesion were highly represented in the comparisons except for Mock vs SPRY2 - S112A ( Supplementary Table 3 ) . These findings were also supported by a Gene Set Enrichment Analysis ( GSEA ) on adhesion - related KEGG and GO pathways ( Figure 2 ) . Our previous studies showed the capacity of SPRY2 to inhibit the expression of 6 CDH1 / E - cadherin causing loss of intercellular adhesion . 7 Additionally , SPRY2 is preferentially expressed in cells at invasion front of human colon tumors in vivo . 7 These results , together with data from in silico analyses , led us to perform a detailed inspection of genes related to adhesion structures and pathways . As compared to Mock cells , SPRY2 - wt cells showed lower expression levels of genes encoding adherens junctions proteins ( CDH1 , CDH3 ) , tight junctions proteins ( CLDN7 / claudin - 7 , OCLN / occludin ) and other adhesion molecules ( GJB2 , NCAM , JUP / CTNNG ) ( Supplementary Table 2 ) . Conversely , SPRY2 - wt cells expressed higher level of ZEB1 and CLDN1 / claudin - 1 , which has been proposed to be protumorigenic in colon cancer . 25 SPRY2 - wt cells showed also reduced expression of several genes encoding integrins ( ITGB8 , ITGB4 , ITGB2 , ITGB6 ) and extracellular matrix proteins ( TNC , LAMB3 , LAMC2 , LAMA3 ) . Downregulation of CLDN7 and OCLN and upregulation of CLDN1 and ZEB1 in SPRY2 - wt and SPRY2 - Y55F cells were validated by qRT - PCR and Western blot ( Figures 1b and c ) , using the reported inhibition of CDH1 / E - cadherin as control . 7 GSEA revealed that the expression profiles of genes encoding adhesion and extracellular matrix proteins were significantly enriched in SPRY2 - S112A cells and Mock cells compared to SPRY2 - wt ( Figure 2 ) . Further supporting a role of SPRY2 disrupting tight junction functionality and cell polarity , our transcriptomic study showed also reduced expression in SPRY2 - wt and SPRY2 - Y55 cells of LLGL2 / HUGL2 , INADL / PATJ1 and ST14 , polarity genes that promote tight junction formation and function as tumor suppressors ( Supplementary Table 2 and Figures 1d and e ) . 20 , 26 - 28 SPRY2 represses also Epithelial Cell Adhesion Molecule ( EPCAM ) gene that is mutated in a proportion of Hereditary Non - Polyposis Colorectal Cancer patients and whose overexpression has tumor type - dependent effects on patient survival ( Figures 1d and e ) . 29 EpCAM protein binds claudin - 1 and claudin - 7 7 and regulates their dynamics and the function of tight junctions . 30 , 31 . Epithelial Splicing Regulatory Protein 1 ( ESRP1 ) , which encodes a broad splicing regulator in epithelial cells that prevents the EMT process , 32 , 33 was strongly downregulated in SPRY2 - wt cells and , conversely , upregulated in SPRY2 - S112A cells ( Figure 1d ) . Consistent with the findings described above , the expression levels of ZEB1 and SPRY2 proteins directly correlate in a panel of colon carcinoma cell lines ( Supplementary Figure S2 ) . Collectively , these results indicate that SPRY2 ectopic expression causes loss of the epithelial phenotype ( adhesiveness and polarity ) by controlling multiple genes , and highlight the importance of Ser 112 for this function . To investigate how SPRY2 regulates tight junction genes , we cloned a fragment of CLDN7 proximal promoter ( - 1136 / + 428 bp ) upstream the luciferase reporter gene . Overexpression of SPRY2 markedly reduced the activity of CLDN7 promoter ( Figure 1f ) . ZEB1 is a major inducer of EMT that represses a number of epithelial adhesion genes . We found an inverse relation between the expression level of claudin - 7 and ZEB1 proteins in the four cell types ( Figure 1c ) . Interestingly , ectopic expression of ZEB1 inhibited CLDN7 promoter in Mock cells but did not further decrease its activity in SPRY2 - wt cells , which is consistent with the high level of ZEB1 expression in the latter cells ( Figure 1f ) . This supports a major role of ZEB1 in the repression of CLDN7 by SPRY2 . ZEB1 mediates the repression of epithelial adhesion and polarity genes by SPRY2 Given that ESRP1 , LLGL2 / HUGL2 and ST14 genes are repressed by ZEB1 in other systems , 34 - 36 we sought to elucidate to what extent the gene regulatory effects of SPRY2 depend on ZEB1 . We knock - downed ZEB1 by transfection of shRNA in Mock cells , as confirmed at the RNA and protein levels ( Figures 3a and b ) . ZEB1 downregulation 8 increased CDH1 , CLDN7 , ST14 , OCLDN , and ESRP1 RNA ( Figure 3a ) . Data on claudin - 7 , E - cadherin , ST14 and EpCAM were reproduced at the protein level ( Figure 3b ) . In agreement with the reciprocal negative feedback loop of regulation described in other systems , 37 - 39 ZEB1 knock - down caused the upregulation of miR - 200b and miR - 200c ( Figure 3c ) . Similar results were obtained in SPRY2 - wt cells in which ZEB1 was silenced by lentivirus transduction of ZEB1 shRNA ( Figures 3d - f ) . Moreover , interference expression of ZEB1 in SPRY2 - wt cells induced CLDN7 and CDH1 promoters ( Figure 3g ) . Identical results were obtained by using lentiviruses to knock - down ZEB1 expression in Mock cells ( Supplementary Figure S3 ) . These results strongly suggest that ZEB1 mediates the dysregulation of tight junction and epithelial polarity genes by SPRY2 and that ZEB1 is a probable direct repressor of claudin - 7 . Inverse correlation between the expression of SPRY2 and ZEB1 with that of claudin - 7 in colon tumors To explore the relevance of these findings in vivo , we analyzed the expression of SPRY2 , ZEB1 and claudin - 7 in tissue microarrays of tumors of colon cancer patients ( Figure 4a ) . Significant positive correlation between the expression of SPRY2 and ZEB1 ( n = 39 , r = 0 . 63 , P < 0 . 0001 ) and negative correlation between that of ZEB1 and claudin - 7 ( n = 53 , r = - 0 . 36 , P = 0 . 007 ) and SPRY2 and claudin - 7 ( n = 34 , r = - 0 . 35 , P = 0 . 037 ) were found ( Figure 4b ) . These results were consistent with those obtained in cultured cells supporting the idea that the regulation of ZEB1 by SPRY2 and the repression of claudin - 7 by ZEB1 occur also in vivo in human colon tumors . Mechanism of ZEB1 upregulation by SPRY2 9 To investigate the mechanism of ZEB1 upregulation by SPRY2 we first studied whether this effect could be mediated by the modulation of miRs targeting ZEB1 RNA . An in silico analysis of ZEB1 - RNA - 3’UTR region using three independent target prediction algorithms ( TargetScan , miRANDA , PicTar ) revealed the presence of several putative binding sites for evolutionarily conserved miR species : miR - 142 - 3p , miR - 23 , miR - 150 , miR - 342 - 3p and the previously described miR - 200b / c 37 - 39 ( Figure 5a ) . To examine the role of these miRs in ZEB1 RNA regulation by SPRY2 , their expression was analyzed by qRT - PCR in Mock and SPRY2 - wt cells . miR - 142 - 3p , miR - 23a and miR - 150 , and also miR - 200b , miR - 200c , but no miR - 342 - 3p , were expressed at lower level in SPRY2 - wt cells than in Mock cells ( Figure 5b ) . Reduced expression of miR - 200b and miR - 200c was also detected in SPRY2 - Y55F cells , but not in SPRY2 - S112A cells ( Figure 5c ) . To determine whether these miRNAs directly modulate ZEB1 levels , we cloned a fragment of ZEB1 - RNA - 3’UTR containing the putative miRNA - binding sites into the psiCHECK2 dual luciferase reporter vector . Co - transfection of HEK293T cells with mimic oligonucleotides of miR - 200b , miR - 142 - 3p and miR - 150 , but not miR - 23a , together with a ZEB1 - RNA - 3’UTR - luciferase construct , resulted in reduced luciferase activity at both low ( 5 nM ) and high ( 50 nM ) amount of transfected oligonucleotides ( Figure 5d ) . Moreover , mutation of predicted binding sites for miR - 200 family and miR - 150 , but not for miR - 142 - 3p ( Figure 5e , left ) , reverted this effect , indicating that miR - 200 and miR - 150 are direct modulators of ZEB1 ( Figure 5e , right ) . Transfection of miR - 200b into SPRY2 - wt cells reduced the expression of ZEB1 RNA and protein more efficiently than the transfection of miR - 150 or miR - 142 - 3p using scrambled - transfected SPRY2 - wt cells and Mock cells as controls ( Figures 5f and g ) . Consistently , only miR - 200b led to upregulation of claudin - 7 and E - cadherin ( Figure 5g ) . These results show a 10 preferential regulation of ZEB1 RNA by miR - 200 and an additional effect of miR - 150 , and support that the repression of claudin - 7 by SPRY2 is mediated by ZEB1 . To examine whether SPRY2 could control directly the expression of miR - 200b / c , we used luciferase - reporter vectors containing the promoter of miR - 200b / a ( miR - 200b - a - 429 ( - 321 / + 120 ) ) 40 and miR - 200c ( hsa - miR - 200c promoter ( - 683 / - 67 ) ) . 39 First , these plasmids were transfected into Mock and SPRY2 - wt cells . A stronger reduction in the activity of miR - 200b / a and miR - 200c promoters was found in SPRY2 - wt cells that express SPRY2 constitutively , while transfected ZEB1 expression vector further decreased the activity of the two promoters in Mock cells but not in SPRY2 - wt cells ( Figure 5h ) . Second , ZEB1 and SPRY2 expression vectors were transiently transfected in SW480 - ADH cells . Exogenous SPRY2 did not change the activity of the two miRs promoters and did not affect their inhibition by ZEB1 ( Figure 5i , left ) . These results agree with the reported direct inhibition of miR - 200b / a and miR - 200c promoters by ZEB1 and suggest that the effect of SPRY2 is mediated by the upregulation of ZEB1 , which does not take place at sufficient level upon transient SPRY2 transfection ( Figure 5i , right ) . Next we studied putative mediators of the upregulation of ZEB1 by SPRY2 . Given the relation between SPRY2 and EGF signaling 3 , 4 this pathway was chosen for detailed study . In concordance with other reports , 41 SPRY2 - wt did not change the basal or EGF - induced levels of active ( phosphorylated ) ERK ( Figure 6a ) , which may be related to the presence of a mutated K - RAS gene in SW480 - ADH cells . By contrast , SPRY2 amplified the activation of AKT induced by EGF ( Figure 6b ) . Additionally , reduction of active phospho ( p ) - AKT , using wortmannin ( PI3K inhibitor ) or MK2266 ( AKT inhibitor ) decreased the level of ZEB1 ( Figure 6c ) . Likewise , the Src inhibitor PP2 decreased ZEB1 expression in Mock and SPRY2 - wt cells and increased that of 11 claudin - 7 in Mock cells ( Figure 6d ) . Thus , AKT and Src seem to participate in the upregulation of ZEB1 by SPRY2 . ETS1 mediates the upregulation of ZEB1 by Snail1 in mouse breast epithelial cells , 42 and our transcriptomic analysis revealed that the RNA level of ETS1 transcription factor is 1 . 62 - fold higher in SPRY2 - wt cells than in Mock cells , while no differences were found for ETS2 ( Supplementary Table 2 ) . Therefore , we investigated its implication in SPRY2 action . First , we confirmed by Western blot analysis the presence of higher level of ETS1 protein in SPRY2 - wt and SPRY2 - Y55F cells than in Mock and SPRY2 - S112A cells ( Figure 6e ) . Second , transduction of SPRY2 - wt cells with lentiviruses encoding ETS1 shRNA led to a partial reduction of ZEB1 protein expression levels ( Figure 6f ) . Third , in contrast , ETS1 expression was unaffected by ZEB1 knock - down in SPRY2 - wt cells showing that no reciprocal regulation exists ( Figure 6g ) . Fourth , overexpression of ETS1 by transient transfection of an exogenous cDNA increased ZEB1 expression ( Figure 6h ) . These results suggest that ETS1 contributes to the induction of ZEB1 by SPRY2 , which is most likely amplified by the repression of miR - 200 and miR - 150 species ( Figure 6i ) . 12 DISCUSSION This study shows that SPRY2 triggers a coordinated pattern of gene expression through the imbalance of the ZEB1 / miR200 switch in favor of ZEB1 upregulation mediated at least in part by ETS1 and AKT . This mechanism leads to the loss of polarized and adhesive epithelial phenotype . Tight junctions are responsible for epithelial barrier function and polarity , and control cell proliferation and differentiation , which are disrupted at early and advanced stages of tumorigenesis . 43 In particular , downregulation of claudin - 7 is an early event in colorectal cancer 44 and promotes tumorigenesis of colon cancer cells . 45 , 46 Data obtained in biopsies from colon cancer patients indicating an inverse relation between ZEB1 and claudin - 7 expression are consistent with the downregulation of many tight junction and polarity genes by SPRY2 in SW480 - ADH cells . In addition , they agree with the tumorigenic role of ZEB1 and its inverse relation between claudin - 7 and other family members and ZEB1 in lung cancer . 47 Altogether , our results showing repression of tight junction proteins by SPRY2 strongly support a protumorigenic action in colon cancer . Notably , mutation of Ser 112 residue ( SPRY2 - S112A cells ) abolishes most SPRY2 effects on the expression of epithelial genes . The role of this aminoacid in SPRY2 activity is controversial . One study has proposed that Ser 112 phosphorylation by Mnk1 , a kinase activated by p38MAPK , stabilizes Spry2 protein in Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) - K1 cells . 23 In contrast , another study shows that Mnk2 ( also a p38MAPK substrate ) but not Mnk1 phosphorylates SPRY2 leading to its association with the E3 ubiquitin ligase Nedd4 and posterior degradation in HEK293T cells . 24 Likewise , p38MAPK decreases Spry2 content in mouse embryo fibroblasts via phosphorylation of Siah2 E3 ubiquitin ligase . 48 Our results agree with this study as the p38MAPK inhibitor SB203080 increased the level of SPRY2 protein in Mock cells ( not shown ) . In addition , 13 our data agree with those of Edwin et al . regarding the similar effects of wild - type and Tyr 55 SPRY2 proteins . 24 Mutation of Tyr 55 , that has been proposed to generate a dominant - negative SPRY2 in terms of inhibition of FGF signaling , 21 - 23 did not affect the repression of tight junction or polarity proteins ( SPRY2 - Y55F cells ) , indicating that this residue is important for only a subset of SPRY2 actions . The precise mechanism by which SPRY2 regulates gene expression is not fully known . We analyzed the expression of the homeobox SIX1 gene , which is overexpressed in colorectal cancer and promotes EMT at least in part via the repression of miR - 200 family and activation of ZEB1 . 49 No differences were detected ( Supplementary Figure S4 ) . By contrast , the longer activation of AKT and the effect of AKT and Src inhibition on ZEB1 induction suggest that these two enzymes are implicated in SPRY2 action in SW480 - ADH cells that , of note , overexpress EGF and harbor a mutated K - RAS gene . AKT and Src may contribute to upregulate ETS1 , which in turn activates ZEB1 . 42 In conclusion , our findings support a key role of SPRY2 promoting the EMT process in colon carcinoma cells through ZEB1 induction by a mechanism that implies AKT / Src , ETS1 and miR200 / miR - 150 species ( Figure 6i ) . Why SPRY2 has , instead , tumor suppressor activity in other types of cancer cells remains to be elucidated . 14 MATERIALS AND METHODS Cells and cell culture Human colon carcinoma SW480 - ADH and HEK293T embryonal kidney cell lines were cultured in RPMI and DMEM plus 10 % fetal bovine serum respectively ( Life technologies , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) . Cell lines were originally obtained from the American Type Culture Collection ( ATCC ) and authenticated using the GenePrint ® 10 System ( Promega , Madison , WI , USA ) , which allows co - amplification and three - color detection of ten human loci : TH01 , TPOX , vWA , Amelogenin , CSF1PO , D16S539 , D7S820 , D13S317 , D21S11 and D5S818 . Short Tandem Repeat profiles were sent for comparison against cell line databases ( ATCC , DSMZ ) . Last test was done in February 2014 . SPRY2 - wt , SPRY2 - S112A and SPRY2 - Y55F and Mock cells were generated by stable transfection of SW480 - ADH cells with pCEFL - KZ - AU5 , pCEFL - KZ - AU5 - hSPRY2 , pCEFL - KZ - AU5 - hSPRY2 S112A or pCEFL - KZ - AU5 - hSPRY2 Y55F plasmids . 50 Cells were tested routinely to ensure there was no mycoplasma contamination ( Universal Mycoplasma Detection kit , ATCC , Manassas , VA , USA ; # 30 - 1012 ) . Antibodies and reagents We used primary mouse monoclonal antibodies against E - cadherin ( BD Transduction Laboratories , Franklin Lakes , NJ , USA ; # 610182 ) , AU5 ( Covance , Princeton , NJ , USA ; MMS - 135R ) , S6 ribosomal protein ( Cell Signaling , Danvers , MA , USA ; # 23175 ) and p - ERK ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Dallas , TX , USA ; sc - 7383 ) ; rabbit polyclonal antibodies against SPRY2 ( Upstate , Billerica , MA , USA ; # 07 - 524 ) , ETS1 and ERK 2 ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ; sc - 350 and sc - 154 respectively ) , ZEB1 ( Sigma - Aldrich , St Louis , MO , USA ; # HPA027524 ) , ST14 ( Bethyl , Montgomery , TX , USA ; A300 - 221A ) , 15 p - AKT ( Ser473 ) ( Cell Signaling ; # 9271 ) , occludin , claudin - 7 and claudin - 1 ( Life Technologies ; # 71 - 1500 ; # 34 - 9100 ; # 51 - 9000 ) , EpCAM ( Abcam , Cambridge , UK ) and p - S6 ribosomal protein ( Ser240 / 244 ) ( Cell Signaling ; # 2215S ) ; and goat polyclonal antibodies against ZEB1 , AKT , β - actin and lamin B ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ; sc - 10572 , sc1618 , sc - 1616 and sc - 6216 , respectively ) .

Secondary antibodies used for Odyssey Infrared Imaging were IRDye® 800 donkey anti - mouse IgG ( H & L ) ( Rockland Inc , Gibertsville , PA , USA ; # 610 - 732 - 124 ) and IRDye® 680 donkey anti - rabbit IgG ( Rockland Inc . ; # 926 - 32223 ) . Inhibitors : Src - family tyrosine kinases , PP2 ( Tocris , Bristol , UK , # 1407 ) ; PI3K inhibitor , wortmannin ( Cell Signaling ; # 99516 ) , AKT inhibitor , MK2266 ( Selleckchem , Munich , Germany ; # S1078 ) . Cloning of CLDN7 / claudin - 7 promoter A 1 . 56 kb fragment of the h CLDN7 / Claudin - 7 promoter ( - 1136 / + 428 ) similar to the one described by Kohno and colleagues 51 was amplified by PCR using human genomic DNA as template , and the following primers : forward 5’ - GACAAGGAGTGAAACAGG - 3’ and reverse 5’ - TTCCGCCCTCAGAAAACA - 3’ . The resulting product was cloned into the pGEM - T Easy vector ( Promega ) and sequenced . Subsequently , it was released with EcoRI , filled - in using the large fragment of E . coli DNA polymerase I ( Klenow ) , and subcloned into the SmaI site of promoterless pGL3 basic Firefly luciferase expression vector ( Promega ) . Reporter assays 16 Reporter assays were performed in SW480 - ADH , Mock , SPRY2 - wt and HEK293T cells . Unless otherwise indicated , cells were transfected using the jetPEI reagent ( PolyPlus Transfection , New York , NY , USA ) . Firefly ( Luc ) and Renilla reniformis luciferase ( Rluc ) activities were measured separately using the GloMax ® 96 Microplate Luminometer ( Promega ) . Luc activity was normalized to the Rluc activity ( constitutive expression ) . The promoter constructs for miR - 200b / a and miR - 200c were generously provided by Prof . Gregory Goodall ( Center for Cancer Biology , Adelaide , Australia ) and Prof . Thomas Brabletz ( University of Freiburg , Germany ) , respectively . pCDNA3 - ZEB1 expression plasmid was provided by Dr . Antonio García de Herreros ( Instituto Municipal de Investigación Médica , Barcelona , Spain ) . The results are represented as the average of the fold induction obtained from three independent experiments using quadruplicates . 3’ - UTR Luciferase Assays : A portion of the ZEB1 - RNA - 3’UTR containing the studied putative miRNA binding sites was amplified by PCR using the primers forward 5’ - CTCGAG CACAAAATAAATCCGGGTGTG - 3’ and reverse 5’ - GCGGCCGCAGTCCCTGCAATCAGAACTCA - 3’ , and cloned into psiCHECK2 luciferase reporter vector ( Promega ) using XhoI and NotI . HEK293T cells were seeded into 96 - well plates ( 20 x 10 3 cells / well ) and co - transfected ( Lipofectamine 2000 , Life technologies ) with the ZEB1 - RNA - 3’UTR construct and the indicated amounts of mimic negative control ( scrambled ) , miR - 200b , miR - 142 - 3p , miR - 23a and miR - 150 miRIDIAN mimics ( Dharmacon ) . Luciferase activity was measured 24 h later using the Dual - Glo Luciferase Assay System ( Promega ) . Rluc activity was normalized to corresponding Luc activity and plotted as a percentage of the control . Mutations at the putative miRNA binding sites were generated using the QuickChange XL Site - Directed 17 Mutagenesis Kit ( Stratagene , La Jolla , CA , USA ) following the manufacturer’s instructions . Luciferase assays were performed at least three times using triplicates . RNA interference and overexpression strategies ZEB1 knock - down in Mock cells was performed as described . 52 ZEB1 silencing in SPRY2 - wt and Mock cells , and ETS1 silencing in SPRY2 - wt cells was carried out using the lentiviral vector pGIPz containing different shRNA mir sequences : ZEB1 , V3LHS _ 356186 ( sh1 ) , V3LHS _ 356187 ( sh2 ) and V2LHS _ 226625 ( sh3 ) ; ETS1 , V2LHS _ 244928 ( sh1 ) and V3LHS _ 301171 ( sh2 ) ( Dharmacon , GE Healthcare , Pittsburgh , PA , USA ) . Non - silencing shRNA mir sequence ( NS ) , with no homology to known mammalian genes was used as control , cloned in pGIPz vector ( Dharmacon ) . Lentiviruses were produced and tittered as previously described , 53 and target cells were transduced at multiplicity of infection ( MOI ) of 40 . ETS1 overexpression in SW480 - ADH cells was performed by transient transfection of exogenous ETS1 cDNA ( OriGene , Rockville , MD , USA ; # RG227466 ) . Quantitative RT - PCR Total RNA was purified using the NucleoSpin® miRNA extraction kit ( Macherey - Nagel , Düren , Germany ) . Quantitative real - time PCR ( qRT - PCR ) analyses of SPRY2 ( Hs00183386 _ m1 ) , CDH1 ( Hs01023894 _ m1 ) , CLDN1 ( Hs00221623 _ m1 ) , CLDN7 ( Hs00600772 _ m1 ) , ESRP1 ( Hs00214472 _ m1 ) , INADL ( Hs00195106 _ m1 ) , LLGL2 ( Hs00189729 _ m1 ) , OCLN ( Hs00170162 _ m1 ) , ST14 ( Hs01058386 _ m1 ) were performed using the TaqMan Gene Expression Master Mix ( Applied Biosystems , Foster City , CA , USA ) . RNA expression values were normalized versus the housekeeping gene RPLPO ( Large Ribosomal Protein ) . The reaction was performed in a CFX384 18 Real - Time PCR Detection System ( Bio - Rad , Hercules , CA , USA ) . Quantitative real - time PCR ( qRT - PCR ) analyses of hsa - miR - 200b 002251 , - 200c 002300 , - 142 - 3p 000464 , - 23a 000399 , - 150 000473 , and - 342 - 3p 002260 were performed by using miRNA - specific TaqMan MicroRNA Assay Kit ( Applied Biosystems ) . RNU44 001094 small RNA was used for normalization of input RNA / cDNA levels . ZEB1 expression was analyzed by using primers forward 5’ - GCCAATAAGCAAACGATTCTG - 3’ and reverse 5’ - TTTGGCTGGATCACTTTCAAG - 3’ . Values were normalized versus housekeeping gene succinate dehydrogenase complex subunit A ( SDHA ) , forward 5’ - TGGGAACAAGAGGGCATCTG - 3’ and reverse 5’ - CCACCACTGCATCAAATTCATG - 3’ . All experiments were performed at least three times using triplicates . Western blot Western blot was performed as previously described . 7 Proteins were analyzed by using the Odyssey Infrared Imaging or revealed following the ECL technique ( Amersham , Buckinghamshire , UK ) . Different exposure times of the films were used to ensure that bands were not saturated . Western blots in all figures correspond to a representative experiment of at least three performed . Quantification of the experiments is indicated in each figure . Immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy Tissue Microarrays ( TMA ) corresponding to human colorectal ( CRC ) tumors at Stage III , from a collection available in the Pathology Service of the Vall d´Hebron Hospital , were chosen since the protein markers evaluated could potentially have predictive value on cancer progression . Previous data in CRC indicate that the probability of SPRY2 19 expression is around 0 . 90 . If the probability of SPRY2 - mediated ZEB1 overexpression exposure among cases is 0 . 80 , we will need to study 33 cases patients to be able to detect the association between SPRY2 and ZEB1 , with a power of 0 . 90 and two - sided error of 0 . 05 . We used an uncorrected χ 2 statistic to evaluate this hypothesis ( PS Power and Sample Size Calculation v3 . 0 ) . TMA were prepared and immunolabeled as described elsewhere . 54 Briefly , antigens were retrieved by microwaving in 10 mM citrate buffer ( pH 6 . 0 ) for 10 min and permeabilized with 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . Non - specific binding was blocked by incubating the sections in 10 % BSA ( Sigma - Aldrich ) for 1 h . Cell imaging was performed on a Leica TCS SP5 DMI6000 microscope using argon ion ( 488 nm ) , HeNe ( 543 nm ) and violet diode ( 405 nm ) lasers . Images were acquired sequentially by direct register using Leica Confocal Software ( LAS AF ) . Fluorescence image data were analyzed with the MBF " ImageJ for Microscopy " - program collection of plugins ( www . macbiophotonics . ca ) , using criteria described earlier . 55 Briefly , we defined Regions of Interest ( ROI ) in images of immunostained tissues encompassing only tumoral tissue . First , using ImageJ software , we obtained the integrated density value and each channel - molecule ( SPRY2 , red channel ; ZEB1 or claudin - 7 , green channel ) and Hoechst 33342 ( blue channel ) for each ROI . Next , we measured the integrated density for Hoechst signal present in each ROI and normalized by a standard nucleus signal , defined as the average integrated density of ten nuclei taken at random . The resulting values correspond to the number of nuclei and , therefore , to the number of cells present in each ROI . Finally , we divided the values of the integrated density for each protein of interest ( green or red channels ) by the calculated number of cancer cells in the corresponding ROI . These values indicate the level of expression for each protein per cancer cell analyzed noted as relative units ( r . u . ) in the corresponding figures . 20 Gene expression analysis Microarray analyses were performed using RNAs obtained from Mock , SPRY2 - wt , SPRY2 - S112A and SPRY2 - Y55F cells in three independent experiments performed in triplicate . Total RNA was extracted following manufacturer ' s instructions ( Macherey - Nagel ) . RNA integrity was assessed using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer ( Agilent , Palo Alto , CA , USA ) . Total RNA samples were then processed for hybridization on Gene Chip Human Gene 1 . 0 ST Array ( Affymetrix , Santa Clara , CA , USA ) using standard Affymetrix protocols at the Genomics and Proteomics Facility of Centro de Investigación del Cáncer ( Salamanca , Spain ) . Scanning was performed using GeneChip System of Affymetrix ( GeneChip Hybridization Oven 640 , GeneChip Fluidics Station 450 and GeneChip Scanner 7G ) . The Robust Microarray Analysis ( RMA ) algorithm was used for background correction , intra - and inter - microarray normalization , and expression signal calculation . 56 The absolute expression signal for each gene was calculated for each microarray . The expression signal was calculated using the CDF package called GeneMapper from GATExplorer ( genemapperhumangene1 . 0cdf ; see webite : http : / / bioinfow . dep . usal . es / xgate / mapping / mapping . php ) , 57 which maps into an updated version of human genes , instead of using the original probe - set definition provided by Affymetrix . This mapping provides an improvement thanks to the re - annotation to updated gene loci and removal of cross - hybridation noise . 57 It also allows us to operate from the beginning using gene identification ( Ensembl IDs ) instead of probe sets ( Affymetrix IDs ) . Mapping to genome version Ensembl v57 ( assembly GRCh37 ) was used for these analyses . Analysis for differential expression was performed using the R platform for statistical analysis ( R Development Core Team ( 2010 ) . R : A language and environment 21 for statistical computing . R Foundation for Statistical Computing , Vienna , Austria . ISBN 3 - 900051 - 07 - 0 , URL http : / / www . R - project . org / ) , and several packages from the Bioconductor project 58 ( http : / / www . bioconductor . org / ) . The raw data were imported into R and preprocessed using the affy package and the robust multichip average method . Further , Pearson correlation test and Principal Component Analysis ( PCA ) were carried out with all genes included in the dataset . To identify differentially expressed genes , we used the limma package . Correction for multiple testing was accomplished by controlling the false discovery rate ( FDR ) using published methods ( FDR = 0 . 1 ) . 59 The experimental settings and raw data obtained in this experiment are deposited in GEO ( accession number GSE56941 ) . Functional Enrichment Analysis Single Enrichment Analysis ( SEA ) was performed with differentially expressed genes between conditions . This analysis was carried out with the functional annotation tool included in the DAVID Bioinformatics Resources . We considered only pathways with a Benjamini P value lower than 0 . 05 for the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes ( KEGG ) , REACTOME , and Gene Ontology – Biological Process databases . We used Gene Set Enrichment Analysis ( GSEA ) 60 ( www . broadinstitute . org / gsea ) to assess the degree of association between our signature ( expression data set ) and some other signatures previously defined with genes significantly enriched in adhesion ( gene sets : REACTOME Adherens _ junctions _ interactions , Gene Ontology : 0005911 Intercellular junctions , Gene Ontology : 0030054 Cell _ junctions , KEGG Adherens junctions , KEGG tight junctions , KEGG gap junctions ) . GSEA requires ranking genes according to their association with a given phenotype , and determining whether genes in a signature tend to present either high ( positively enriched ) or low ranks ( negatively enriched ) . The 22 output of GSEA is an enrichment score ( ES ) , a normalized enrichment score ( NES ) which accounts for the size of the gene set being tested , a P - value and an estimated FDR . ES , NES and FDR were obtained as proposed previously . 60 Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Instat ( GraphPad Software , San Diego , CA , USA ) . All experiments and qRT - PCR analyses were performed at least three times using triplicates . Significant differences between groups , expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean ( s . e . m ) , were calculated by parametric one - way ANOVA using Tukey - Kramer post - test , and correlation coefficients ( r ) were calculated by no parametric Spearman’s test . Homogeneity of variances between groups was analyzed using Brown - Forsythe test ( n . s . P > 0 . 05 ) . The single asterisk indicates P < 0 . 05 , the double asterisk P < 0 . 01 , and the triple asterisk P < 0 . 001 . P > 0 . 05 were considered not significant ( n . s . ) . Ethics statement The work involving human samples was conducted according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki . The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Vall d’Hebron University Hospital ( Barcelona , Spain ) ( Approval ID : PR ( IR ) 79 / 2009 ) . All patients provided written informed consent for the collection of samples and subsequent analysis .
