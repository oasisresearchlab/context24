First , the eral proteins , including cortactin [ 1 ] , profilin [ 5 ] , syn - morphology and dynamics of foci were different . Foci dapin [ 6 ] , and murine Abp1 [ 7 ] , that regulate the actin were longer ( 1 . 5 (cid:1) 0 . 05 (cid:2) m ) than foci in control cells cytoskeleton .

When expressed in cultured cells , dynamin2 K44A moved slightly faster than foci in cells a dynamin2 mutant with decreased affinity for GTP expressing dynamin2 ( 0 . 14 (cid:1) 0 . 02 (cid:2) m / s compared with decreasedactindynamicswithinthecorticalactinnet - 0 . 09 (cid:1) 0 . 001 (cid:2) m / s for dynamin2 - expressing cells and work .

Expression of the amphiphysin1 SH3 domain had little effect on the fluctuation in GFP - CP at foci ; the fluctuation of GFP - CP was decreased to (cid:1) 80 % of that in control , mock - transfected cells ( Figure 1B ) . The mor - phology of foci was unchanged in cells expressing the amphiphysin1 SH3 domain . A mutant form of the amphi - physin1 SH3 domain , which does not bind dynamin or inhibit endocytosis , also had little effect on dynamics of foci . Thus , the effects of expressed dynamin2 K44A on actin dynamics do not appear to be secondary to inhibition of clathrin - meditated endocytosis . We examined the participation of cortactin in actin assembly by using cells expressing mutant forms of cortactin . Dynamin2 binds cortactin via interactions of two SH3 domain binding motifs in its PRD with the cor - tactin SH3 domain [ 1 ] . A point mutation in the cortactin SH3 ( cortactin W525K ) domain greatly reduced binding of dynamin2 to GST fusions of the cortactin SH3 domain in a pull - down assay ( see Figure S1 in the Supple - mentary Material available with this article online ) . Ex - pression of full - length cortactin W525K in PtK1 cells decreased actin dynamics , as measured from the fluo - rescence fluctuation of GFP - CP ( Figure 1C ) . Expression of wild - type , full - length cortactin or an N - terminal frag - mentofcortactin , bothofwhichbindandactivateArp2 / 3 complex in vitro [ 15 ] , did not affect actin dynamics ( Fig - ure 1C ) . These control experiments show that cortactin W525K did not decrease actin dynamics by inhibiting assembly due to binding and sequestering Arp2 / 3 com - plex . Actin dynamics at foci also were decreased in cells expressing cortactin W22A , which does not bind Arp2 / 3 complex and does not activate actin assembly in vitro [ 16 ] . We conclude that the interactions of cortactin with dynamin and Arp2 / 3 complex contribute to actin assem - bly in vivo . Dynamin2 Regulates Actin Assembly by Arp2 / 3 Complex and Cortactin In Vitro To determine how dynamin2 influences actin assembly , we examined the effect of dynamin2 on actin assembly nucleated by Arp2 / 3 complex and cortactin by using purified proteins in vitro . The effects of dynamin2 on actin assembly by Arp2 / 3 complex and cortactin were biphasic ( Figure 2A ) . Low concentrations of dynamin2 enhanced actin assembly by decreasing the lag period for filament formation . Enhanced actin assembly was achieved at molar ratios of dynamin and cortactin of Figure 1 . Dynamin2 Regulates Actin Dynamics in PtK1 Cells less than 1 : 1 .

The fluorescence of pyrene - actin over time is plotted . cortactin W525K for wild - type cortactin eliminated the might result from the association of cortactin with oligo - meric dynamin , preventing cortactin’s interaction with effects of dynamin2 , suggesting that the effects of dy - namin2 on actin assembly were mediated through cor - Arp2 / 3 complex or F - actin . In support of this idea , cor - tactin , but not Arp2 / 3 complex , sedimented with dy - tactin ( Figure 2B ) .
