Previous studies implicated high tensile strain rates in chondrocyte membranes as the cause of impact - induced cell deaths . However , this hypothesis relies on the untested assumption that chondrocyte membranes unfold in vivo during physiological tissue compression , but do not unfold during impact loading . Although membrane unfolding has been observed in isolated chondrocytes during osmotically induced swelling and mechanical compression , it is not known if membrane unfolding also occurs in chondrocytes embedded in their natural extracellular matrix . This study was aimed at quantifying changes in membrane morphology of in situ superﬁcial zone chondrocytes during slow physiological cartilage compression . Bovine cartilage - bone explants were loaded at 5 m m / s to nominal compressive strains ranging from 0 % to 50 % . After holding the ﬁnal strains for 45min , the loaded cartilage was chemically pre - ﬁxed for 12h . The cartilage layer was post - processed for visualization of cell ultrastructure using electron microscopy . The changes in membrane morphology in superﬁcial zone cells were quantiﬁed from planar electron micrographs by measuring the roughness and the complexity of the cell surfaces . Qualitatively , the cell surface rufﬂes that existed before loading disappeared when cartilage was loaded . Quantitatively , the roughness and complexity of cell surfaces decreased with increasing load magnitudes , suggesting a load - dependent use of membrane reservoirs . Chondrocyte membranes unfold in a load - dependent manner when cartilage is compressed . Under physiologically meaningful loading conditions , the cells likely expand their surface through unfolding of the membrane rufﬂes , and therefore avoid direct stretch of the cell membrane .

Keywords : osteoarthritis ; articular cartilage ; impact loading ; cell death ; membrane reservoir Chondrocytes are the only cell type in cartilage . They actively regulate the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) me - tabolism . Chondrocytes have a slow turnover rate , therefore injury - related cell death reduces the number of active chondrocytes , which , if severe enough , triggers tissue degradation as the living cells are not sufﬁcient to maintain tissue structure and integrity . 1 – 3 Therefore , chondrocyte death has been regarded as a primary trigger for the development of osteoarthritis ( OA ) . 1 Chondrocyte death can occur in two modes : Apopto - sis or necrosis . 4 , 5 While apoptosis is a form of programmed cell death that takes time to happen , chondrocyte necrosis occurs immediately after an insult to cartilage , typically through a loss of integrity of the cell membrane . 4 , 5 Most cell membranes exhibit a very small elastic range ( 3 – 4 % ) and will rupture when stretched beyond the elastic limit . 6 – 9 However , isolated chondrocytes have been shown to withstand up to 78 % compressive strain with a corresponding local elongation of cell membranes of > 25 % . 10 , 11 In situ chondrocytes were also found to have up to 26 % increase in overall apparent surface area when the cartilage tissue was loaded by 15 % nominal compres - sive strains . 12 Since cell membranes rupture much before they reach 25 % strain , chondrocytes must have ways for membrane elongation that does not involve direct stretching of the membrane . Cell membranes behave like two - dimensional ( 2D ) ﬂuids with negligible shear rigidity . 13 , 14 When the cell surface area increases because of deformation or cell volume changes , the associated membrane strain is thought to be accommodated by an unfolding of the so - called surface rufﬂes ( folds in the cell membrane ) which protects cell membranes from direct stretch . 15 – 17 The ability of chondrocyte membranes to absorb strains through unfolding of the surface rufﬂes ( also referred to as the membrane reservoir ) has formed the basis of mechanistic models of impact - induced chondrocyte deaths . 11 , 18 Impact loading is thought to cause exceed - ingly high membrane strain rates , which in turn is supposed to limit membrane unfolding , thus causing direct membrane stretch and rupture once the small elastic limit of the membrane is exceeded . This proposi - tion is partly supported by experimental evidence , 18 – 20 and relies on the untested assumption that chondrocyte membranes unfold in vivo for physiological tissue compression rates , but do not unfold , or only unfold to a limited degree , during impact loading rates . Although membrane unfolding has been observed in isolated chondrocytes during osmotically induced swelling 21 and mechanical compression , 22 it is not known if membrane unfolding also occurs in chondro - cytes that are embedded in their natural extracellular matrix environment . Therefore , the purpose of this study was to quantify changes in membrane morphol - ogy of in situ superﬁcial zone chondrocytes during slow physiological cartilage compression . We hypothe - sized that membrane unfolding occurs for these Conﬂicts of interest : None .

METHODS Specimen Preparation and Mechanical Loading Protocol Metatarsal - phalangeal joints of 24 - month - old cows ( N cow ¼ 14 ) were obtained from the local abattoir . Two osteo - chondral blocks were aseptically harvested from the proxi - mal , medial surface of the joints , and maintained in phos - phate - buffered saline ( P5368 , Sigma – Aldrich , ON , Canada ) . The osteo - chondral samples were randomly assigned to either the control - unloaded group or the strain - loaded group ( 10 % strain , N explant ¼ 5 ; 30 % strain , N explant ¼ 4 ; 50 % strain , N explant ¼ 5 ) . Mechanical compression of cartilages was performed on the day of explant harvest . Brieﬂy , full - thickness cartilages attached to the underlying bones were cut using a 6mm circular punch before being attached to a specimen holder using dental cement . Tissue thickness was determined by needle indentation at four locations close to the loaded region . Hydrated cartilages were indented using a ﬂat - ended , impermeable , cylindrical ( 2mm diameter ) indenter attached to a servo - hydraulic material testing system ( MTS 858 Mini Bionix II , MTS Systems Corp . , AB , Canada ) in a stress - relaxation mode . A load cell was ﬁtted between the indenter and the MTS system in order to record the reaction force resulting from tissue compression . The applied stress was calculated by dividing the tissue reaction force by the area of the indenter . The cartilages were compressed to nominal tissue strains of 0 % , 10 % , 30 % , and 50 % at a constant rate of 5 m m / s . After holding the load for (cid:2) 45min , the saline solution was replaced by a pre - ﬁxative solution consisting of 0 . 7 % ruthenium hexammine trichloride ( RHT ) and 2 % glutaralde - hyde in 0 . 05M cacodylate buffer at pH 7 . 4 . After pre - ﬁxing the sample for 12h , the indenter was removed and full - thickness cartilages containing the indented area were cut from the underlying bone and kept in the pre - ﬁxative solution overnight . Electron Microscopy Cartilage samples were immersed in 0 . 1M cacodylate buffer containing 1 . 6 % paraformaldehyde , 0 . 7 % RHT , and 2 . 5 % glutaraldehyde at pH 7 . 4 ( 2h ) . After washing three times with the same buffer , the samples were post - ﬁxed in 1 % osmium tetroxide buffered with 0 . 1M cacodylate buffer at pH 7 . 4 ( 2h ) . Samples were then stained with 0 . 5 % uranyl acetate ( 1h ) and dehydrated through a graded series of ethanol prior to embedding in Spurr’s resin . Ultrathin sections ( (cid:2) 70nm ) were cut using a diamond knife mounted on an ultra - microtome ( Ultracut E , Leica - Reichert Jung , Wetzlar , Germany ) along the direction of tissue thickness prior to staining using 2 % aqueous uranyl acetate and Reynolds’ lead citrate . The ultrathin sections were imaged by a transmission electron microscope ( H - 7650 , Hitachi High Technologies America Inc . , CA ) at an accelerating voltage of 80kV . 2D micrographs of individual chondrocytes ( N cell ¼ 22 for each of the loading groups ) with well - deﬁned nuclei in the superﬁcial zone tissues ( the top 7 . 5 % tissue thickness ) were taken at a magniﬁcation of either 6 , 000 (cid:3) ( for unloaded cartilages ) or 20 , 000 (cid:3) ( for loaded cartilages ) through a mounted AMT 16 , 000 digital camera . Image Analysis Changes in chondrocyte membrane morphology as a function of tissue compression were analyzed using measures of surface roughness and surface complexity . 2 – 6 individual chondrocytes were selected for analysis from each tissue explant . In order to quantify surface roughness , the circumference of individual cells was manually tracked to obtain the true cell circumference ( red solid outline , Fig . 1 ) . The region enclosed by the true cell circumference was then best - ﬁt to an ellipse ( green dash - dotted outline , Fig . 1 ) of equal area and second moment of area . 23 In addition , a best - ﬁtting cubic spline was used to approximate the outline of cells ( blue dashed outline , Fig . 1 ) . Surface roughness was deﬁned as the percentage difference in circumference between the cell and the ﬁtted ellipse ( ellipse - ﬁtted roughness ) . As there may be a mismatch between the actual cell shape and the best ﬁtting ellipse , we also used a spline - ﬁtting approach ( spline - ﬁtted roughness ) that uses cubic spline segments to approximate the cell shapes more accurately and to assess the validity of the simpler ellipse - ﬁtted surface roughness . In order to measure the surface complexity , fractal analysis was performed on the membrane morphology . The manually tracked cell circumference was analyzed through the box - counting method using the plugin “FracLac” algo - rithm ( Karperien , A . , version 2 . 5 , url : Http : / / rsb . info . nih . gov / ij / plugins / fraclac / FLHelp / BoxCounting . htm ) in ImageJ ( Na - tional Institutes of Health , MD ) . Brieﬂy , cell images were Figure 1 . Illustration of the steps involved in quantifying the surface roughness . ( a ) Original electron micrograph of a chondro - cyte ; ( b ) same image as in ( a ) , but the image was intentionally brightened in order to highlight the cell circumference . First , the true cell circumference ( red solid line ) was manually tracked . The enclosed area was then best - ﬁt to an ellipse ( green - dashed - dotted line ) of equal area and second moment of area . A cubic spline function was also ﬁt to the outline of cells ( blue - dashed line ) . The surface roughness was deﬁned as the percentage difference in circumference between the cell and the ﬁtted ellipse ( ellipse - ﬁtted roughness ) or between the cell and the ﬁtted spline curve ( spline - ﬁtted roughness ) . MEMBRANE UNFOLDING PROTECTS CHONDROCYTES 305 JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC RESEARCH FEBRUARY 2017 overlaid with a grid of known size ( box size ) and the number of boxes that contain the cell membrane ( box count ) was quantiﬁed . This process was repeated using multiple grids of decreasing sizes . The box counting fractal dimension was obtained from the slope of the linear regression line esti - mated from the natural logarithmic plot of box count against box size ( see Supplementary Materials S1 , for more details ) . The shape of cells was described by the aspect ratio , deﬁned as the ratio of the lengths of the major to the minor axis of the best - ﬁtting ellipse . Statistical Analysis Data were expressed as means (cid:4) 1 standard deviation . The means of the surface roughness and the surface complexity were analyzed for loading effect using generalized estimating equations ( GEE ) to take into account the correlated nature of the observations and the unbalanced study design . Multiple comparisons were accounted for through Holm – Bonferroni adjusted p - values . 24 The means of the ellipse - ﬁtted rough - ness and spline - ﬁtted roughness were compared by paired t - test . Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient was used to investi - gate the relationship between the membrane surface rough - ness and the box - counting fractal dimension as well as the relationship between the membrane surface roughness and the cell aspect ratio ( a ¼ 0 . 05 ) ( SPSS 20 , SPSS Inc . , IL ) . RESULTS Indentation of cartilage to nominal strains of 50 % ( N explant ¼ 5 ) , 30 % ( N explant ¼ 4 ) , and 10 % ( N explant ¼ 5 ) resulted in peak stresses of 15 . 7 (cid:4) 1 . 8 MPa , 5 . 3 (cid:4) 1 . 1 MPa , and 1 . 0 (cid:4) 0 . 3 MPa and equilibrium stresses of 1 . 1 (cid:4) 0 . 1 MPa , 0 . 4 (cid:4) 0 . 1 MPa , and 0 . 1 (cid:4) 0 . 1 MPa , respectively . In response to increasing tissue strains , chondro - cytes became ﬂatter with their aspect ratio increasing from 2 . 4 (cid:4) 1 . 1 ( 0 % strain ) , to 4 . 3 (cid:4) 1 . 9 ( 10 % strain ) , to 6 . 9 (cid:4) 2 . 2 ( 30 % strain ) , and to 10 . 1 (cid:4) 3 . 8 ( 50 % strain ) . While the cells became ﬂatter , increasing tissue strains were also associated with a qualitative de - crease in membrane surface roughness ( Fig . 2 ) . Quan - titative analysis conﬁrmed a highly signiﬁcant decrease in surface roughness ( primary y - axis of Fig . 3 ) with increasing tissue strains ( p < 0 . 0001 , Fig . 3 ) . The decrease in surface roughness was most pronounced upon loading to 10 % tissue strains , but continued to decrease for the 30 % and 50 % tissue strains , albeit to a smaller degree ( Fig . 3 ) . A similar trend was also observed for the box - counting dimensional approach as the fractal dimensions of the cell membranes decreased with increasing tissue strains ( secondary y - axis of Fig . 3 ) . It should be noted that we observed a high statistical signiﬁcance ( p < 0 . 0001 ) between the unloaded control group sam - ples and each of the loaded experimental group samples ( 10 % strain , 30 % strain , and 50 % strain ) . Therefore , only two micrographs from the paired - control samples were randomly selected from each of the loaded samples , and cells used for analysis Figure 2 . Representative chondrocyte micro - graphs from different loading groups showed a decrease in surface roughness with increasing nominal strains applied to the cartilage tissue . The y - axis represents the axis of tissue compres - sion . All analyzed cells resided in the superﬁcial zone of the cartilages ( top 7 . 5 % tissue thickness ) . Scale bar indicates 2 m m .

The surface roughness and box - counting dimensions decrease as tissue strain increases , suggest - ing that the chondrocytes unfold their membrane folds during mechanical compression in a load - dependent manner .

The relationship between cell shape and membrane rufﬂes was studied by plotting the ellipse - ﬁtted surface roughness as a function of cell aspect ratio using data that were pooled across all strain conditions . It was found that the ellipse - ﬁtting surface roughness de - creased with increasing aspect ratio , with a good logarithmic ﬁt ( r 2 ¼ 0 . 59 , Fig . 4 ) . In particular , the membrane unfolding seemed to reach a plateau when the cell aspect ratio went beyond 10 ( Fig . 4 ) . There were notable variations in surface roughness of unloaded control cells for speciﬁc cell shapes ( Fig . 4 ) . Although cells were selected from the top 7 . 5 % of the tissue samples , small differences in the distance from the articular surface to the individual cells may result in a different sensitivity of the membrane strains , and thus the observed variations in surface roughness among the unloaded control cells . However , this is likely not the case because surface roughness was found to be independent of the location in which the chondrocytes reside within this top 7 . 5 % tissue thickness ( see Supplementary Materials S2 ) . Surface roughness was quantiﬁed using cell out - lines derived using the best - ﬁtting ellipse and the best - ﬁtting cubic spline approach introduced above . However , there were no differences between results obtained using the ellipse - ﬁtting roughness approach and the spline - ﬁtting roughness approach ( p ¼ 0 . 353 ) . In addition , results derived from surface roughness and from surface complexity were also compared . Although using completely different algorithms , the results of membrane surface roughness for the two approaches used here were highly correlated with the results obtained from standard box - counting fractal analysis ( r 2 ¼ 0 . 78 , Fig . 5 ) . DISCUSSION In order to better understand the mechanism of chondrocyte necrosis associated with cartilage impact loading , we previously developed a mechanistic model of impact - induced cell death through theoretical and experimental studies . 11 , 18 This model was built on the assumption that cell membranes have waves ( rufﬂes ) that unfold when cartilage is compressed . However , such membrane unfolding has neither been shown directly nor has it been quantiﬁed . The primary goal of the current study was to establish if chondrocytes unfold their membrane rufﬂes when exposed to in - creasing amounts of cartilage compression in their natural extracellular matrix environment , and if so , to quantify the membrane unfolding response . Our results indicate a signiﬁcant reduction in chondrocyte membrane surface roughness in response to tissue strains , thus providing strong evidence that mem - brane unfolding is a protective mechanism against membrane rupture ( Figs . 2 and 3 ) . Unfolding of the membrane rufﬂes increased with the magnitude of tissue compression , thereby further supporting our conclusions ( Figs . 3 and 4 ) . Superﬁcial zone chondrocytes were targeted in this study , as impact injuries mostly lead to cell death in superﬁcial zone tissues . 25 – 27 While the physiological strains of cartilage tissue range from 10 % to 35 % , 28 , 29 we applied 50 % tissue strain to unravel the response of chondrocytes to extreme tissue strains . It should be noted that the compressive strains in the superﬁcial zone tissue are higher than the applied nominal tissue strains due to the lower stiffness of the superﬁcial zone cartilage compared to the mid - and deep zone carti - lage . 30 Two completely different methods ( membrane surface roughness and membrane fractal dimension ) for analyzing cell membrane morphology under Figure 4 . Scatterplot of the membrane surface roughness from all loading groups ( strains of 0 % , 10 % , 30 % and 50 % ) as a function of cell aspect ratio ( N cell ¼ 22 for each group ) . As a result of tissue compression , the cell aspect ratio increases ( denoting ﬂatter shape ) . However , the membrane surface roughness de - crease with increasing cell aspect ratio , with a good logarithmic ﬁt ( r 2 ¼ 0 . 59 ) . Figure 5 . Relationship between ellipse - ﬁtted membrane surface roughness and box - counting fractal dimensions ( N cell ¼ 22 for each group ) . The standard box - counting approach used for fractal analysis produced results that were highly correlated with the surface roughness deﬁned in the current study ( r 2 ¼ 0 . 78 , p < 0 . 0001 ) . The high correlation between the two parameters suggests the soundness of our new deﬁnition for ‘membrane surface roughness’ in quantifying cell surface mor - phology . MEMBRANE UNFOLDING PROTECTS CHONDROCYTES 307 JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC RESEARCH FEBRUARY 2017 compression produced similar results with surprisingly high correlations ( Fig . 5 ) , thus providing conﬁdence in our deﬁnition of “membrane surface roughness . ” Cell surface rufﬂes have been regarded for some time as a form of membrane reservoirs 14 , 15 , 17 that can be used to buffer tensile membrane strains . However , the extent of this potential reservoir and its function in situ have not been quantiﬁed . Our results suggest that membrane unfolding occurs to a great extent for small tissue strains ( 0 – 10 % ) , with decreasing effect for large strains ( 10 – 50 % ) suggesting that membrane unfolding might protect cells best upon initial tissue loading , and that there may be a limit to the extent of membrane unfolding . Likely , chondrocytes have other protective strategies to keep their membranes intact . Indeed , the second possible form of protection may come from the caveolar system of chondrocytes . Cav - eolae are the small ﬂask - shaped invaginations ranging from 6 nm to 90 nm diameters in size that lie along the cell membrane . 31 , 32 It is thought that the caveolae originate from the incorporation of intracellular lipid vesicles and serve as a form of membrane reservoir that will be used for surface expansion when the cell membrane is under stretch . 33 , 34 Previous studies have found that live cells will increase their total membrane surface area when being stretched . 35 Flask - shaped caveolae were observed in most of the chondrocytes investigated in this study and a representative image of these in a cell at 30 % strain is shown in Figure 6a . Preliminary data on the number of caveolae per cell at each strain are shown in Figure 6b and future studies should investigate this observation more systemati - cally . The third possible chondrocyte membrane protec - tive mechanism may be associated with the ﬂuid loss induced by large cell deformation . Cells of identical volumes with a large aspect ratio ( ﬂat cells ) have a greater surface area than cells with a small aspect ratio ( round cells ) . During cartilage compression , cells become ﬂatter ( Fig . 4 ) and would require up to three times the original membrane surface area for the loading conditions used in the current study , if cells were to maintain constant volumes . However , the magnitude of membrane expansion is reduced if cells lose volume through ﬂuid loss during tissue loading . Such cell volume losses have been observed for in situ 12 , 36 and in vivo 37 chondrocytes under mechanical compression . Therefore , strain - induced volume loss may play a role in reducing membrane strains during cartilage compression . In addition to providing protection against mem - brane rupture , the load - induced membrane unfolding may also play an important role in regulating the metabolic behavior of chondrocytes . The metabolic behavior of chondrocytes is governed in part by mechanotransduction events at the cell membrane , which are thought to be triggered by local membrane strains . 38 , 39 When cell membranes are deformed lo - cally , extracellular mechanical signals may cause intracellular biochemical processes that are activated through “stretch - activated ion channels” in the cell membrane 40 , 41 and / or deformation of the membrane - anchored cytoskeleton . 42 Our results of the membrane unfolding may provide crucial insight into the local deformation of chondrocyte membranes for different tissue loading conditions , and may enhance our under - standing of the mechanisms underlying chondrocyte mechanotransduction . Interestingly , the membrane rufﬂes in unloaded chondrocytes were asymmetrically distributed Figure 6 . Caveolae were observed in chondrocytes residing in cartilages that were loaded by 0 – 50 % nominal strain . ( a ) Characteristic chondrocyte micrograph obtained from cartilage loaded by 30 % nominal compressive strain . A local region highlighted by the red square was magniﬁed to show an array of caveolae ( small membrane invaginations ) lining the plasma membrane . The caveolae either fused with the plasma membrane ( arrows ) or remained as sub - membrane closed vesicles ( arrowhead ) . Fused caveolae were ﬂask - shaped with an average length of the major axis of 61 . 5 (cid:4) 4 . 5nm and minor axis of 48 . 3 (cid:4) 3 . 2nm . ( b ) Box plot of the number of caveolae observed per chondrocyte . There are 22 chondrocytes analyzed in each loading group . The whiskers represent the minimum and maximum number of caveolae observed per cell . 308 MOO AND HERZOG JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC RESEARCH FEBRUARY 2017 ( polarity - like ) . Sections of the membranes facing the articular surface typically showed less rufﬂes than sections of the membranes facing towards the bone ( Fig . 2 ) . Such top - bottom “polarity” of membrane rufﬂes may be of functional relevance and may be dictated by the mechanical loading environment experienced by cells , or by the location of speciﬁc transmembrane proteins , as has been reported in cell types other than chondrocytes ( e . g . , epithelial cells ) . 43 The functional relevance of this asymmetry in mem - brane rufﬂes is not known and should be studied in the future , as it may contain important information about cell volume regulation and protection of cell membranes against excessive strains . Nevertheless , the results of this study suggest that chondrocyte behavior and properties should be determined with the cells in their natural in situ state , as cells isolated from their matrix environment lose their in situ shape and asymmetric distribution of membrane rufﬂes that uniquely characterize the cells under in situ condi - tions . 21 This study has limitations that need to be consid - ered when interpreting our results . First , the results presented here represent steady state responses of chondrocytes . Although it is possible that chondrocytes behave differently under dynamic conditions , previous studies found that chondrocytes will reach a “steady state” shape during continuous dynamic load - ing . 37 , 44 Second , we assumed that the cell membranes unfold instantaneously with cell deformation . How - ever , it is unknown if the membranes unfold in an instantaneous or in a delayed manner when cells undergo shape changes . Due to the limitations of the current technology , the membrane morphology cannot be observed at high resolution in real time . Third , while RHT was used to prevent cell shrinkage from the surrounding ECM , 45 previous studies raised con - cerns about RHT in inhibiting cell collapse at nominal compressive strains lower than 20 % , and in causing vacuole formation in cytosol . 46 However , we found that the mean aspect ratio of the cells increased from 2 . 4 to 4 . 3 when the cartilages were loaded by 10 % strains , suggesting that the tissue compressive strains were successfully transferred to the cells at low tissue strains . Also , only cells without apparent vacuole in the cytoplasm were used for image analysis . Fourth , live – dead cell assays were not performed in the current study . However , previous studies have shown that chondrocytes remain viable in articular cartilage that is compressed up to 80 % nominal strains . 47 Also , only individual cells with no apparent breach of the plasma membrane were selected for image analysis . Therefore , we are conﬁdent that our results represent the response of live cells prior to chemical ﬁxation . Fifth , the varying osmotic conditions in control and experimental tissues due to tissue compaction may result in shrinkage artefacts in chondrocytes exposed to different loading conditions . These artefacts cannot be neglected when comparing cells from different tissue zones ( superﬁcial , middle , and deep ) zones . In order to minimize these artefacts , only cells from the top 7 . 5 % of the tissue thickness were selected for image analysis in the current study . Finally , although this study represents a ﬁrst step in evaluating the hypothesis of membrane unfolding in live chondrocytes embedded in their natural environment under physio - logical loading condition , the results of this study are yet to have a clear clinical application . In summary , the results of this study led us to the conclusion that chondrocytes unfold their membrane rufﬂes in a load - dependent manner during physiologi - cal loading as a protective measure against cell membrane rupture . However , membrane unfolding is likely not the sole mechanism of membrane protection as chondrocytes may also use the caveolar system and strain - induced volume loss to protect membranes from excessive stretch . These proposed mechanisms need careful investigation in the future .
