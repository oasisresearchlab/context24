In addition , SHARPIN enhances nuclear factor - kappaB ( NF - κ B ) activity as a component of the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex ( LUBAC ) . However , it is currently unclear how regulation of these seemingly different roles is coordinated . Here , we show that SHARPIN binds integrin and LUBAC in a mutually exclusive manner . We map the integrin binding site on SHARPIN to the ubiquitin - like ( UBL ) domain , the same domain implicated in SHARPIN interaction with LUBAC component RNF31 ( ring finger protein 31 ) , and identify two SHARPIN residues ( V267 , L276 ) required for both integrin and RNF31 reg - ulation . Accordingly , the integrin α - tail is capable of competing with RNF31 for SHARPIN binding in vitro . Importantly , the full SHARPIN RNF31 - binding site contains residues ( F263A / I272A ) that are dispensable for SHARPIN - integrin interaction . Importantly , disrupt - ing SHARPIN interaction with integrin or RNF31 abolishes SHARPIN - mediated regulation of integrin or NF - κ B activity , respectively . Altogether these data suggest that the roles of SHARPIN in inhibiting integrin activity and supporting linear ubiquitination are ( molecularly ) distinct . Introduction Integrins are heterodimeric transmembrane receptors composed of an α - and a β - subunit that mediate cell interaction with the extracellular matrix and neighboring cells . Binding of extracel - lular ligands or intracellular integrin activators , such as TALINs or FERMTs ( also known as kindlins ) , induces a pronounced conformational change in the integrin heterodimer . This con - formational switch results in integrin activation and the formation of a large macromolecular complex at integrin cytoplasmic tails that connects the adhesion site to the actin cytoskeleton PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0143423 November 23 , 2015 1 / 16 OPEN ACCESS Citation : De Franceschi N , Peuhu E , Parsons M , Rissanen S , Vattulainen I , Salmi M , et al .

Academy of Finland , and activates a plethora of intracellular signaling pathways [ 1 ] . Deregulated integrin activity has been implicated in many human pathologies , including immune diseases , skin blistering , bleeding disorders and cancer ( reviewed in [ 1 – 3 ] ) . We previously identified SHANK - associ - ated RH domain interactor ( SHARPIN ) as an important integrin inactivator , which interacts directly with the conserved region of the α - integrin cytoplasmic domain and prevents recruit - ment of TALIN and FERMTs to the integrin beta 1 ( ITGB1 ) cytoplasmic tail [ 4 ] . More recently , we showed that SHARPIN is an important regulator of lymphocyte migration as it inactivates integrin alpha L - integrin beta 2 ( ITGAL - ITGB2 , also known as LFA - 1 ) to support uropod detachment in polarized lymphocytes [ 5 ] . Nuclear factor - kappaB ( NF - κ B ) is an oncogenic and pro - inflammatory transcription factor that mediates the cellular response to a wide array of stimuli . SHARPIN was identified as an essential component of the Linear Ubiquitination Assembly Complex ( LUBAC ) [ 6 – 8 ] , which stimulates canonical NF - κ B signaling in response to cytokines , bacteria and genotoxic stress [ 9 ] . These studies demonstrate that SHARPIN regulates at least two important , yet seemingly distinct cellular pathways : integrin activation [ 4 ] and canonical NF - κ B signaling [ 6 – 8 ] . Never - theless , the relationship between these two SHARPIN functions has remained obscure . To investigate this further we performed detailed structure - function studies on the contribution of SHARPIN to integrin and LUBAC regulation . We find that integrins , similar to the catalytic subunit of LUBAC ( RNF31 ; ring finger protein 31 , also known as HOIL - 1 - Interacting Protein ( HOIP ) ) [ 6 ] , bind the conserved central ubiquitin - like domain ( UBL ) of SHARPIN . Further - more , mutational analyses , based on a 3D model of the SHARPIN UBL domain , revealed that integrin and RNF31 interact with partially overlapping regions within the UBL domain of SHARPIN . Thus , RNF31 and integrin bind to SHARPIN in a mutually exclusive manner , sug - gesting that the roles of SHARPIN in inhibiting integrin activity and supporting linear ubiqui - tination are molecularly distinct . Results The ubiquitin - like domain ( UBL ) of SHARPIN is the binding site for integrin α - chains Direct interaction between SHARPIN and integrin α - tails or RNF31 is essential for SHARPIN - mediated integrin inhibition [ 4 ] and LUBAC function [ 6 – 8 ] , respectively . RNF31 binds the conserved central UBL domain of SHARPIN [ 6 ] , but the integrin binding region of SHARPIN has not been identified . As the SHARPIN - binding region is conserved within all α - integrins and as SHARPIN inhibits both ITGB1s and leukocyte - specific ITGB2s [ 4 , 5 ] , we designed experiments to analyze SHARPIN - integrin interaction using different integrin heterodimers and cell types to ensure generality of our findings . SHARPIN has three conserved functional domains ; the N - terminal pleckstrin homology ( PH ) superfold that mediates homomultimerization [ 10 , 11 ] , the central UBL domain and the C - terminal NPL4 zinc finger domain ( NZF ) that is required for LUBAC function [ 6 ] . To map the integrin binding site on SHARPIN , fragments of the SHARPIN coding sequence , contain - ing one or more functional domains flanked by additional regions ( Fig 1A ) , were cloned into GFP and GST expression vectors . A pull - down assay was performed to assess binding of the indicated GFP - SHARPIN fragments to biotinylated peptides corresponding to the cytoplasmic domain of ITGAL [ 5 ] , using an ITGB2 peptide as a negative control . GFP - SHARPIN 181 - 310 was not included due to very low expression levels . Interestingly , the ITGAL tail was found to interact with all SHARPIN fragments containing the central UBL domain , but not the N - or C - terminal fragments , suggesting that the UBL domain contains the integrin - binding site ( Fig 1B ) .

Thus , integrins and RNF31 both interact with the UBL domain of SHARPIN . Fine - mapping of the integrin binding site on SHARPIN As structural data on the SHARPIN UBL domain are currently unavailable , the Swiss Model Server [ 12 ] was used to create a homology model in order to map the putative integrin binding site within the UBL domain .

These residues were chosen for alanine scanning mutational analysis , resulting in three double and three single SHARPIN mutants ; SHARPIN V240A / L242A , SHARPIN E260A / L261A , SHARPIN L261A / F263A , SHARPIN V267A , SHARPIN I272A and SHAR - PIN L276A . SHARPIN I272A was shown previously to abolish RNF31 binding [ 6 ] . Far - Western analysis revealed clearly reduced ITGAL - ITGB2 binding by SHARPIN V267A compared to SHARPIN WT ( Fig 3A ) , while ITGAL - ITGB2 binding by SHARPIN L276A was only mildly affected . These observations were confirmed using fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy ( FLIM ) measurements of fluorescence resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) between GFP - SHARPIN ( WT or mutants ) and ITGA5 - mCherry [ 4 ] . Compared to GFP - SHARPIN WT , GFP - SHARPIN V267A showed strongly reduced FRET , whereas SHARPIN L276A exhibited a small but significant reduction in FRET efficiency , as evidenced by the representative FRET lifetime images and cumulative FRET efficiency data ( Fig 3B and 3C ) . None of the other muta - tions , including SHARPIN I272A , affected FRET efficiency ( Fig 3B and 3C ) , indicating that these Fig 2 . Designing SHARPIN mutants using a SHARPIN UBL domain model .

Importantly , expression of all GFP - SHARPIN variants was similar and no degradation products were observed ( S1A Fig ) . Taken together , the UBL domain residue V267 is essential for SHARPIN interaction with the α – integrin cyto - plasmic domain , whereas the RNF31 - binding [ 6 ] I272 residue is dispensable for SHARPIN - integrin interaction . SHARPIN V267A does not inhibit integrin activity or affect cell migration As direct interaction of SHARPIN with integrin results in integrin inactivation [ 4 ] , we sought to determine the ability of the integrin binding - deficient SHARPIN mutants to inhibit integrin Fig 3 .

The integrin activation index was mea - sured using fluorescently - labelled fibronectin repeat 7 – 10 in Chinese Hamster Ovary ( CHO ) cells overexpressing GFP alone , WT or mutant GFP - SHARPIN , together with RFP - TALIN head to increase integrin activation . Importantly , expression of GFP - SHARPIN variants and RFP - TALIN head was similar in the different samples ( S1B Fig ) . In full agreement with the binding data ( Fig 3 ) , expression of GFP - SHARPIN V267A did not result in integrin inactivation ( Fig 4A ) . In contrast , expression of the RNF31 - binding mutant GFP - SHARPIN I272A inhibited integrin activity as efficiently as GFP - SHARPIN WT ( Fig 4A ) . Interestingly , despite only slightly reduced ability to bind integrins ( Fig 3A – 3C ) , the ability of GFP - SHARPIN L276A to inactivate integrins was completely abolished ( Fig 4A ) , suggesting that , while integrin binding is clearly necessary [ 4 ] , integrin binding is not sufficient for SHARPIN to inactivate integrins . Alterna - tively , GFP - SHARPIN L276A might only partially bind integrins and therefore be unable to inac - tivate integrins . Fig 4 .

Therefore , to determine if defects in integrin inhibition translate to changes in cell migration , cpdm MEFs expressing GFP alone , WT or mutant GFP - SHARPIN , growing on 50 μ g / ml collagen , were imaged using time - lapse microscopy . As expected on this substrate , cells expressing GFP - SHARPIN WT migrated with higher velocity than cells expressing GFP alone ( Fig 4B ) , consistent with GFP - SHARPIN inhibiting integrin activity . In line with the integrin activity assays ( Fig 4A ) , cells expressing GFP - SHARPIN V267A or GFP - SHARPIN L276A migrated signifi - cantly slower than cells expressing GFP - SHARPIN WT ( Fig 4C and 4D ) , while all other mutants affected cell migration in a similar fashion as GFP - SHARPIN WT . Taken together , these data show that SHARPIN V267A is not only unable to bind integrins , but is also unable to inhibit integrin activity or affect cell migration . The RNF31 and integrin binding sites in SHARPIN partially overlap Our data show that residues V267 and L276 , but not I272 , are involved in SHARPIN - mediated integrin inactivation , indicating that the RNF31 and integrin binding sites are not identical , although both are located within the SHARPIN UBL domain ( Fig 1 and [ 6 ] ) . Previous reports have demonstrated a role for SHARPIN in Tumor Necrosis Factor ( TNF , also known as TNF α ) induced NF - κ B activity in MEFs , keratinocytes , B - cells and hepatocytes [ 6 – 8 , 16 ] , as well as in activated B - cell like diffuse large B - cell lymphoma [ 17 ] , PC3 and DU145 prostate cancer cells [ 18 ] . We now confirm that siRNA - mediated SHARPIN silencing in PC3 cells ( Fig 5A ) reduced TNF - induced NF - κ B activity as measured using a dual luciferase assay ( Fig 5B ) . Next the ability of the SHARPIN mutants to support LUBAC activity was tested ( Fig 5C ) . As expected , re - expression of GFP - SHARPIN WT in SHARPIN - silenced PC3 cells rescued NF - κ B activity significantly compared to expression of GFP alone ( Fig 5C ) . GFP - SHARPIN L261A / F263A , GFP - SHARPIN V267A , GFP - SHARPIN L276A and GFP - SHARPIN I272A , on the other hand , were unable to rescue NF - κ B activation ( Fig 5C ) , indicating a role for these residues in LUBAC function . ELISA - based binding assays ( Fig 5D ) and Far - Western analyses ( Fig 5E ) using recombinant RNF31 and WT or mutant GST - SHARPIN showed that the impaired ability of these mutants to support LUBAC function corresponds to reduced SHARPIN - RNF31 interac - tion . Therefore , in addition to the previously reported I272 [ 6 ] , residues F263 , V267 and L276 are required for SHARPIN binding to RNF31 and are thus essential for LUBAC function . In summary , our data show that the RNF31 and integrin binding sites partially overlap ( around V267 ) , with the RNF31 binding site covering a larger area on SHARPIN . Importantly , SHAR - PIN mutants F263A and I272A can be used to specifically disrupt LUBAC function without affecting the ability of SHARPIN to regulate integrin activity . Integrin and RNF31 binding to SHARPIN are mutually exclusive Our data showing that the integrin binding site is nested within the RNF31 binding site suggest that integrin and RNF31 might compete for SHARPIN binding . Indeed , the ability of GST - SHARPIN to bind recombinant RNF31 in vitro was inhibited in the presence of a SHAR - PIN - binding peptide [ 5 ] corresponding to the cytoplasmic domain of ITGAL ( Fig 6A ) . Impor - tantly , integrin - bound endogenous SHARPIN , immunoprecipitated using an ITGAL antibody from Jurkat cells , did not associate with RNF31 ( Fig 6B ) , further demonstrating that integrin - bound SHARPIN is not able to simultaneously bind RNF31 and vice versa . SHARPIN interacts preferentially with the unengaged integrins in cells in suspension and is displaced from acti - vated integrins in adherent cells [ 4 ] . Consistent with the mutually exclusive RNF31 and Independent Functions of SHARPIN PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0143423 November 23 , 2015 7 / 16 integrin binding , we found increased interaction between GFP - SHARPIN and RNF31 in adherent HEK293 cells compared to cells in suspension ( Fig 6C ; normalized to total RNF31 levels and the amount of GFP - SHARPIN in pull - downs ) . Furthermore , TNF - induced NF - κ B activity is higher in PC3 cells adherent to fibronectin compared with cells adherent to poly - L - lysine , to which cells adhere in an integrin - independent manner ( Fig 6D ) , suggesting that the increased RNF31 - SHARPIN interaction in adherent cells ( Fig 6C ) correlates with higher LUBAC activity . Lastly , treatment of PC3 cells or MEFs with a membrane permeable TAT - peptide corresponding to the cytoplasmic tail of ITGA1 ( α 1 - TAT ) , which contains the SHAR - PIN binding site and is capable of sequestering cytoplasmic SHARPIN in cells [ 4 ] , diminished TNF - induced NF - κ B activation compared to cells treated with a scrambled TAT - peptide ( ScrTAT ) ( Fig 6E ) . All - in - all , these experiments suggest that SHARPIN binds integrin and RNF31 in a mutually exclusive manner and that SHARPIN might act as a functional link between the interdependent integrin and NF - κ B signaling pathways ( see model in Fig 7A ) . Discussion SHARPIN plays a role in integrin inhibition [ 4 , 5 ] and regulation of LUBAC activity [ 6 – 8 ] , but if and how these seemingly distinct SHARPIN functions are related has remained unknown .

Molecular modeling and muta - tional analysis showed that the integrin binding site is nested within the RNF31 binding site . In line with this , RNF31 and integrin binding to SHARPIN are mutually exclusive in vitro and in cells , demonstrating that the roles of SHARPIN in inhibiting integrin activity and supporting linear ubiquitination are molecularly distinct ( see model in Fig 7A ) . SHARPIN function is not limited to regulation of integrin and NF - κ B activity . SHARPIN was originally identified as an interactor of Shank proteins in the post - synaptic density [ 10 ] . SHARPIN binding to the N - terminal ARR ( ankyrin repeat region ) domain of Shank activates Shank through prevention of an intramolecular , inhibitory interaction with the SPN ( SHANK / ProSAP N - terminal ) domain [ 19 ] . In addition , SHARPIN directly binds EYA1 and EYA2 ( eyes absent homolog 1 and 2 ) , which enhances EYA - SIX complex - mediated activation of target gene expression in several tissues during development [ 20 ] , suggesting a nuclear function for SHARPIN . Furthermore , direct interaction of SHARPIN with PTEN ( phosphatase and tensin Fig 6 . Integrin and RNF31 binding to SHARPIN are mutually exclusive .

Current model of SHARPIN function . ( A ) SHARPIN inhibits integrin activation by binding to the α - integrin cytoplasmic domain and preventing binding of the integrin activator TALIN . In addition , SHARPIN is part of LUBAC , which is required for activation of the canonical NF - κ B pathway . We now demonstrate that integrin and RNF31 binding are mutually exclusive as they are mediated by partially overlapping binding sites within the SHARPIN UBL domain . ( B ) An overview of SHARPIN interactions and how these interactions affect diverse signaling pathways . SHARPIN is depicted schematically with its functional domains ( an N - terminal PH domain , a central UBL domain and a C - terminal NZF domain ) . The UBL domain is a multi - faceted protein interaction hub that has been shown to interact with a number of proteins , highlighted in yellow bars . These interactions each have specific functional consequences , highlighted in green bars . In addition , the N - terminal PH domain of SHARPIN mediates SHARPIN homodimerization and the C - terminal NZF domain is required for LUBAC function . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0143423 . g007 Independent Functions of SHARPIN PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0143423 November 23 , 2015 10 / 16 homolog ) inhibits the phosphatidylinositol 3 , 4 , 5 - trisphosphate ( PIP3 ) phosphatase activity of PTEN [ 21 ] . Thus , SHARPIN is clearly a multifunctional protein ( Fig 7B ) with most likely scaf - folding or adaptor protein - like functions , as SHARPIN has no demonstrated enzymatic activ - ity . Interestingly , all these known SHARPIN regulatory functions are mediated via direct binding of these proteins to the SHARPIN UBL domain [ 6 , 10 , 20 , 21 ] , indicative of its role as a multi - faceted protein interaction hub . Given the relatively small size of the UBL domain ( Fig 2 ) it is unlikely that all these SHARPIN interactors bind simultaneously . In line with this , we show that SHARPIN binding to integrin and RNF31 is mutually exclusive due to partially over - lapping interaction sites . The set of SHARPIN UBL domain mutants described in this study can be utilized as a tool to determine whether additional SHARPIN interactors also occupy the RNF31 and integrin interaction site . Furthermore , mutants that specifically disrupt one SHAR - PIN function but leave others intact , such as the RNF31 - binding SHARPIN L261A / F263A and SHARPIN I272A mutants that are fully functional as integrin inhibitors , will be instrumental in the future to distinguish between distinct functions of SHARPIN . Two decades ago cell adhe - sion - induced integrin activation was shown to increase NF - κ B activity [ 22 , 23 ] , although the molecular mechanism has remained obscure . It is attractive to hypothesize that SHARPIN mediates this phenomenon as SHARPIN is released from integrins upon cell adhesion [ 4 ] . However , while the data presented here support such a model ( Fig 6C – 6E ) , this remains to be investigated further . The ability of SHARPIN to regulate multiple cellular functions via the central UBL domain suggests that different signaling pathways may compete for SHARPIN and , thus , that SHAR - PIN functions as a signaling co - ordinator . Which SHARPIN function dominates over the oth - ers is likely to be cell - type and context dependent and also regulated by additional cellular components . One such cellular component could be filamin , an integrin inhibitor that forms a ternary complex with both the α - and β - integrin cytoplasmic domains [ 24 ] . The SHARPIN and filamin binding domains in the integrin α - tail , while very close , do not overlap [ 4 , 24 ] , opening the possibility that filamin and SHARPIN bind integrins simultaneously and possibly cooperatively , resulting in stronger inhibition of integrin activity . On the other hand , as the α - integrin cytoplasmic domains are very small , SHARPIN and filamin could equally well bind in a mutual exclusive fashion , in which case high filamin levels would release SHARPIN from integrins . Which of these possibilities is correct and whether filamin regulates other SHARPIN functions remains to be investigated . In another example , SHARPIN enhances PTEN Lys63 - linked polyubiquitination , which in turn increases interaction between PTEN and SHARPIN [ 25 ] , although it remains unclear what triggers PTEN ubiquitination . At present , whether competition for SHARPIN dictates the balance of these different signaling pathways is unknown as there are no data available on the relevant stoichiometry of SHARPIN and its interacting proteins . However , this implies a possible scenario where acute regulation of SHARPIN levels by some external stimuli could potentially switch the balance between SHAR - PIN - regulated pathways in favour of the highest affinity interactor . Deregulation of integrins , PTEN and the NF - κ B pathway are all strongly linked to cancer progression [ 1 – 3 , 26 – 28 ] . Importantly , SHARPIN is amplified in a wide variety of human can - cer types ( BioPortal . org ; [ 29 ] ) . Furthermore , SHARPIN protein levels are elevated in prostate cancer [ 18 ] and SHARPIN promotes cancer cell proliferation and tumor formation in several different cancer types [ 18 , 21 , 30 ] . In DU145 prostate and HeLa cervical cancer cell lines these oncogenic effects were attributed to SHARPIN ’ s ability to inhibit PTEN function [ 21 ] . How - ever , in PTEN - null PC3 prostate cancer cells SHARPIN also increased tumorigenicity implying that other functions , such as NF - κ B signaling , are also involved [ 18 , 30 ] . Thus , while SHARPIN clearly has oncogenic properties , the molecular mechanisms remain poorly described and are most likely dependent on the other malignant signaling alterations present .
