How these two systems interact and control directional cell migration is an outstanding question but remains understudied . Here we identiﬁed a negative feedback between contractile actin assemblies and phosphorylated caveolin - 1 ( CAV - 1 ) in migrating cells . Cytoplasmic CAV - 1 vesicles display actin - associated motilities by sliding along actin ﬁlaments or / and coupling to do retrograde ﬂow with actomyosin bundles . Inhibition of contractile stress ﬁbers , but not Arp2 / 3 - dependent branched actin ﬁlaments , diminished the phosphorylation of CAV - 1 on site Tyr14 , and resulted in substantially increased size and decreased motility of cytoplasmic CAV - 1 vesicles . Reciprocally , both the CAV - 1 phospho - deﬁcient mutation on site Tyr14 and CAV - 1 knockout resulted in dramatic AMPK phosphorylation , further causing reduced active level of RhoA - myosin II and increased active level of Rac1 - PAK1 - Coﬁlin , consequently led to disordered contractile stress ﬁbers and prominent lamellipodia . As a result , cells displayed depolarized morphology and compromised directional migration . Collectively , we propose a model in which feedback - driven regulation between actin and CAV - 1 instructs persistent cell migration . Keywords : actin ﬁlaments , actomyosin bundles , Arp2 / 3 complex - dependent lamellipodia , directional cell migration , caveolin - 1 INTRODUCTION The actin cytoskeleton and caveolae are important players in regulating cell morphology and directional migration . Early electron microscopy studies revealed the association of caveolae with ﬁlamentous actin ( Rohlich and Allison , 1976 ; Rothberg et al . , 1992 ; Valentich et al . , 1997 ) , and later the actin - binding protein ﬁlamin A was found to be important for caveolae co - alignment with actin stress ﬁbers ( Muriel et al . , 2011 ) . However , aside from membrane - located caveolae which has been extensively studied as tension sensor and intimately interact with cortical actin Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology | www . frontiersin . org 1 April 2021 | Volume 9 | Article 665919 fcell - 09 - 665919 April 5 , 2021 Time : 10 : 32 # 2 Shi et al . Crosstalk Between Actin and Caveolin - 1 ( Sinha et al . , 2011 ) , the interactive mechanisms between actin and cytoplasmic caveolin - 1 ( CAV - 1 ) , principal structural component of caveolae ( Navarro et al . , 2004 ) , have remained elusive . For example , how speciﬁc actin assemblies control the cytoplasmic CAV - 1 , and reciprocally , how CAV - 1 protein per se regulate signaling cascades to control dynamic actin assemblies and subsequent cell behavior . Cytoplasmic CAV - 1 could either form pivotal structural component for caveolae , or form non - caveolae CAV - 1 vesicles / foci ( Razani et al . , 2002b ; Pol et al . , 2020 ) . It is speculated , but no direct evidence yet , that the organization and traﬃcking of both CAV - 1 forms are tightly associated with distinct intracellular actin assemblies and critical actin - binding proteins . Global disruption of the actin network by cytochalasin D treatment was found to form strong clustering of CAV - 1 ( Fujimoto et al . , 1995 ; Mundy et al . , 2002 ) . Patches of non - polymerized actin are concentrated around rapidly moving CAV - 1 spots ( Echarri et al . , 2012 ; Stoeber et al . , 2012 ) . Depletion of myosin - 1c , one actin associated motor protein , induces a perinuclear accumulation of CAV - 1 and a decrease in caveolar density ( Hernandez et al . , 2013 ) . Knockdown of actin nucleator mDia1 and Abl kinase induces caveolae clustering , whereas active mDia1 increases stress ﬁber formation , and reduces the numbers of clustered “caveolar rosettes” superstructures ( Echarri et al . , 2012 ) . Nevertheless , silencing the Arp2 / 3 complex or its activators N - WASP and cortactin does not aﬀect the endocytic process of CAV - 1 vesicles from the plasma membrane ( Echarri et al . , 2012 ) , but how their roles during the dynamic regulation of intracellular CAV - 1 remain less examined . Actin assemblies require the spatial and temporal integration of diﬀerent signaling components ( Ridley et al . , 2003 ; Vicente - Manzanares et al . , 2005 ) . By coordinating the active levels of Rho family of small GTPases and ultimately , actin polymerization , Rac1 regulates lamellipodia protrusion and membrane ruﬄes and Cdc42 triggers ﬁlopodia , whereas RhoA regulates the formation of actomyosin - formed stress ﬁbers and cell contractility ( Ridley et al . , 2003 ; Raftopoulou and Hall , 2004 ; Vicente - Manzanares et al . , 2005 ) . Previous reports suggest that CAV - 1 promotes cell migration ( Zhang et al . , 2000 ; Gonzalez et al . , 2004 ; Grande - Garcia et al . , 2007 ; Joshi et al . , 2008 ; Hill et al . , 2012 ) . For example , CAV - 1 depletion in mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts has been shown to elevate the active level of Rac1 and Cdc42 while decrease the RhoA activity , thus lead to defects in actin remolding associated cell motility ( Grande - Garcia et al . , 2007 ) . However , other studies indicate that CAV - 1 could be a negative regulator in the context of cell migration . For instance , restoration of CAV - 1 expression in MTLn3 cells reduces the chemotactic directed cell migration ( Zhang et al . , 2000 ) . Likewise , CAV - 1 knockdown increased the persistent migration toward sphingosine - 1 phosphate in bovine aortic endothelial cells ( Gonzalez et al . , 2004 ) . Although some of these discrepancies could be ascribed to technical or cell type speciﬁcity issues , it appears important to ascertain what kind of role , if any , CAV - 1 plays in the coordinated processes of directional migration through controlling of actin assembly and remodeling . In this study we identiﬁed that the cytoplasmic CAV - 1 vesicles move concurrently with the retrograde ﬂow of actin ﬁlaments toward the deep cytoplasmic perinuclei region , and meanwhile are also able to laterally slide along the actin ﬁlaments . Moreover , contractile actomyosin bundles determine the organization and dynamics of intracellular CAV - 1 by disturbing its phosphorylation level , whereas branched actin structures are dispensable . Importantly , CAV - 1 depletion leads to compromised intrinsic persistent migration through remolding the active level of AMPK , which in turn regulates the activity of Rac1 and downstream PAK1 and Coﬁlin for protrusive lamellipodia , and correspondingly the activity of RhoA and subsequent changes in stress ﬁbers formation and contraction . Furthermore , the phosphorylation of CAV - 1 on site Tyr14 plays an essential role in regulating these kinase - GTPase signaling axis governed actin remodeling . Taken together , our study comprehensively investigates and hence provides new insights into the interactive feedback mechanisms between actin assemblies and cytoplasmic CAV - 1 in the context of cell migration . RESULTS Cytoplasmic CAV - 1 Interacts With Actin Filaments in Human Osteosarcoma Cells To identify novel actin ﬁlament interactions , we performed a proximity - dependent biotin identiﬁcation ( BioID ) analysis ( Roux et al . , 2012 ) on human osteosarcoma cells ( U2OS ) using a biotin ligase fused to Tropomyosin - 3 . 1 ( Tpm3 . 1 ) , a central actin ﬁlaments component ( Supplementary Figure 1A ; Parreno et al . , 2020 ) . Among the high - conﬁdence interactors , CAV - 1 , which has been used as a measure of cytoplasmic traﬃcking of both individual and clustered forms of caveolae ( Mundy et al . , 2002 ; Echarri et al . , 2012 ) , was chosen for further investigation ( Figure 1A ) . Previous studies have demonstrated co - alignment of CAV - 1 with ﬁlamentous actin in a number of cell types , such as NIH3T3 cells , epithelial cells , ﬁbroblasts , myoﬁbroblasts and muscle cells ( Rohlich and Allison , 1976 ; Rothberg et al . , 1992 ; Valentich et al . , 1997 ) . Immunoﬂuorescence imaging on U2OS cells , which are much adherent and show clear endogenous staining of cytoskeleton ( Jiu et al . , 2015 , 2019 ) , revealed an extensive actin network and readily recognizable CAV - 1 vesicles , and the cytoplasmic CAV - 1 vesicles were found aligned with actin ﬁlaments occasionally ( Figure 1B ) , indicating the enability to determine the association between these structures in U2OS cells . We next assess the actin associated intracellular movement of CAV - 1 , using expression of ﬂuorescent protein fusion constructs . This revealed a punctate pattern that colocalized with endogenous CAV - 1 but showed no co - distribution with Rab8 - labeled endosomes , indicating a proper distribution with respect to the endogenous protein ( Supplementary Figure 1B ) . By using wheat germ agglutinin ( WGA ) , a small - molecule marked the plasma membrane , we showed that the actin ﬁlaments - associated CAV - 1 signals were mainly localized in the cytoplasm Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology | www . frontiersin . org 2 April 2021 | Volume 9 | Article 665919 fcell - 09 - 665919 April 5 , 2021 Time : 10 : 32 # 3 Shi et al .

( C ) Time - lapse imaging of U2OS cells co - expressing CAV - 1 - mEGFP and mCherry - actin revealing that actin - associated cytoplasmic CAV - 1 vesicles move along actin ﬁlaments ( Box 1 ) and do retrograde ﬂow with contractile arcs ( Box 2 ) . The magniﬁed regions of Box 1 and 2 in different time point are shown on the right panels , respectively . White and yellow circles and dotted lines in the magniﬁed regions indicate the starting and ending position of discrete CAV - 1 tagged vesicles and contractile arcs , respectively . The recording was set as every 1 s for 200 s . Bars , 10 µ m ( in cell image ) and 5 µ m ( in Box 1 and Box 2 ) . ( Supplementary Figure 1C ) . To record the cytoplasmic CAV - 1 vesicles , we optimized the imaging focal plane based on the clear and sharp appearance of DAPI - labeled nucleus in the following experiments , which demarcated the cytoplasmic ( middle layer ) rather than the plasma membrane ( bottom layer ) ﬁeld ( Supplementary Figure 1D ) . Live cell imaging enabled us to identify that while the CAV - 1 vesicles at the perinuclear area did not exhibit regular movements , others which close to cell periphery associated with contractile actin transverse arcs and displayed retrograde ﬂow toward the cell center , accompanying with cases of sliding along actin ﬁlaments ( Figure 1C and Supplementary Videos 1 , 2 ) . Together , these data provide direct evidences that CAV - 1 vesicles interact with actin network in human osteosarcoma cells . Contractile Actin Assemblies Are Critical for the Organization and Dynamics of CAV - 1 Vesicles by Disturbing Its Phosphorylation Level Global pharmacological disruption of actin cytoskeleton in U2OS cells leads to an increase of cytoplasmic CAV - 1 clustering ( Supplementary Figures 2A , B ) . In migrating cells actin ﬁlaments are able to assemble into distinct three - dimensional structures . To further elucidate the underlying regulation by these speciﬁc actin arrangements to cytoplasmic CAV - 1 vesicles , we employed diﬀerent actin - directed drugs with speciﬁc targets ( Figure 2A ) . Blebbistatin and CK666 inhibiting myosin II ATPase activity and Arp2 / 3 complex were applied , and thereby interfering with the formation of contractile and branched ﬁlament assemblies , respectively ( Kovacs et al . , 2004 ; Chanez - Paredes et al . , 2019 ) . Neither of the drugs aﬀected the transcription and expression level of CAV - 1 ( Supplementary Figures 2C , D ) , while ﬂuorescence imaging witnessed their expected eﬀects on actin organization with extensive loss of prominent contractile bundles after exposure to blebbistatin and of lamellipodia after CK666 treatment , respectively ( Figure 2A ) . Enlarged CAV - 1 vesicles appeared upon blebbistatin addition , but remain similar size as in wild - type under CK666 circumstance ( Figure 2B ) . Moreover , the motility of cytoplasmic CAV - 1 vesicles was signiﬁcantly compromised when myosin II activity , but not Arp2 / 3 , was inhibited ( Figure 2C ) . Having identiﬁed that actomyosin dependent contractility is important for cytoplasmic CAV - 1 , prompted us to conﬁrm this inﬂuence by using Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology | www . frontiersin . org 3 April 2021 | Volume 9 | Article 665919 fcell - 09 - 665919 April 5 , 2021 Time : 10 : 32 # 4 Shi et al . Crosstalk Between Actin and Caveolin - 1 alternative approach . Myosin - 18B depletion cells are reluctant to form large myosin II stack and subsequent result in less contractile actin stress ﬁbers ( Jiu et al . , 2019 ) , while elimination of ARPC2 , component of Arp2 / 3 complex ( Goley and Welch , 2006 ) , leads to less branched actin formed lamellipodia . Consistent with the results by pharmacological inhibitors , increased size and decreased motility of CAV - 1 vesicles were observed in myosin - 18B knockout cells , but not ARPC2 knockdown cells ( Supplementary Figures 2E – H ) . Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) measurement was also applied to validate the relatively slow kinetics of cytoplasmic CAV - 1 molecules lacking of contractile actomyosin bundles ( Figures 2D , E ) . Tyr14 is an important phosphorylation site to modulate CAV - 1 activity and subsequent focal adhesion dynamics , cell migration and mechanical stimuli ( Navarro et al . , 2004 ; Zimnicka et al . , 2016 ; Wong et al . , 2020 ) . The phospho - deﬁcient ( Y14F ) and phospho - mimic ( Y14D ) mutants were exogenously expressed in CAV - 1 knockout ( CAV - 1 KO ) cells , respectively , to eliminate the interference of endogenous CAV - 1 . With tracking of real - time imaging , we revealed that the CAV - 1 ( Y14D ) vesicles represented faster motility while the CAV - 1 ( Y14F ) vesicles are overall slower than wild - type ( Figures 2F , G ) , suggesting that CAV - 1 phosphorylation is intimately correlates with its cytoplasmic dynamics . Notably in this context , we examined the eﬀects of above drugs on the phosphorylation state of CAV - 1 . Western blot indicated that the phosphorylated CAV - 1 level on site Tyr14 was apparently decreased in actomyosin inhibition vs . wild - type , but was not signiﬁcantly altered upon Arp2 / 3 inhibition ( Figures 2H , I ) . Taken together , these data demonstrate that contractile actin assemblies are critical for the organization and dynamics of cytoplasmic CAV - 1 , most likely by regulating its phospho - related active level . Phospho - Deﬁcient and Depletion of CAV - 1 Compromises the Assembly of Contractile Stress Fibers by Deactivating RhoA - Dependent Myosin Phosphorylation To explore the cellular function of CAV - 1 , we generated CAV - 1 knockout ( KO ) U2OS cells by CRISPR / Cas9 approach with two diﬀerent target sites , and one of the CAV - 1 KO cell lines was chosen for further analysis ( Supplementary Figure 3A ) , and the rest cells were used for veriﬁcation in some of the experiments ( data not shown ) . Phalloidin staining was shown that wild - type cells contained prominent stress ﬁbers , whereas both CAV - 1 KO and RNA silencing induced CAV - 1 knockdown ( CAV - 1 KD ) cells contained a disorganized meshwork of actin ﬁlaments , characterized by thinner contractile stress ﬁbers ( Figure 3A and Supplementary Figures 3B , C ) . The quantiﬁcation by using Ridge Detection plugin in ImageJ ( Kumari et al . , 2020 ; Zhao et al . , 2020 ) conﬁrmed that there was signiﬁcant decrease in levels of thick actin ﬁlament bundles in CAV - 1 KO / KD cells , whereas the total amount of ﬁlaments remained comparable ( Figure 3B and Supplementary Figure 3C ) . To allow more precise analysis , cells were plated on crossbow shaped ﬁbronectin micropatterns , where they obtain nearly identical shapes and display characteristic organization of stress - ﬁber network ( Jiu et al . , 2015 ) . The contractile actomyosin bundles were typically thinner in CAV - 1 KO cells compared to wild - type cells on micropatterns ( Figure 3C ) . Moreover , CAV - 1 KO cells displayed wider lamella which is a phenotype associated with defects in the assembly and contractility of stress ﬁbers ( Burnette et al . , 2014 ; Jiu et al . , 2015 ) . Corresponding with the reduced amounts of thick stress ﬁbers , the average sizes of vinculin - positive focal adhesions and phosphorylation level of focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) were decreased in CAV - 1 KO cells ( Figure 3C and Supplementary Figure 2D ) . Importantly , exogenously expression of the full - length CAV - 1 - mEGFP completely restore the stress ﬁber and focal adhesion phenotypes , but not the phospho - deﬁcient CAV - 1 ( Y14F ) - mEGFP ( Figures 3A – C ) , indicating that Tyr14 is a critical site for CAV - 1 and expression this single point mutation of CAV - 1 recapitulates the CAV - 1 KO phenotype of compromised stress ﬁber assemblies . Furthermore , CAV - 1 deﬁcient cells exhibited weaker contractile forces and an unbalanced tension distribution to the substrate ( Figure 3D ) , which is the consequences from actomyosin defects . Small GTPase RhoA regulates the phosphorylation of myosin light chain ( MLC ) to promote stress ﬁber contractility and assembly ( Guilluy et al . , 2011a , b ; Lessey et al . , 2012 ) . By using pull - down assay and RhoA - GTP biosensor GFP - AHPH ( Piekny and Glotzer , 2008 ; Rong et al . , 2021 ) , we revealed that the active level of GTP bound RhoA signiﬁcantly decreased in CAV - 1 KO cells , exogenously expression of CAV - 1 - mEGFP restore the active level of RhoA ( Figure 3E and Supplementary Figure 3E ) . To conﬁrm these observations , we tested the consequences downstream of RhoA . Phosphorylation of MLC and the level of tropomyosin ( isoform Tpm4 . 2 ) which required for myosin II ﬁlament formation and integrity ( Umemoto et al . , 1989 ; Burgess et al . , 2007 ; Geeves et al . , 2015 ) , also displayed signiﬁcant reduction in CAV - 1 KO cells ( Figure 3F and Supplementary Figures 3F , G ) . p190RhoGAP is a major upstream negative regulator of Rho GTPases ( Jaﬀe and Hall , 2005 ) , knockdown of which restores the decreased RhoA - GTP level and the weaker stress ﬁbers in CAV - 1 depletion cells ( Figures 3G , H ) . Collectively , these results reveal that CAV - 1 is critical for the contractile stress ﬁbers formation . Phospho - Deﬁcient and Depletion of CAV - 1 Leads to AMPK Activation Followed by Rac1 - Dependent PAK1 and Coﬁlin Phosphorylation , and Subsequent Lamellipodia Formation It is important to note that in addition to disorganized stress ﬁber network , both CAV - 1 KO and phospho - deﬁcient CAV - 1 ( Y14F ) cells appear more pronounced lamellipodia in the cell edge visualized by actin and ARPC2 staining ( Figures 3A , 4A ) . The actin distribution was further checked by interference reﬂection microscopy ( IRM ) , which is applied to visualize molecules near the cell - substrate interactions ( Verschueren , 1985 ) . Consistent with aforementioned phalloidin staining , strong stress ﬁbers were Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology | www . frontiersin . org 4 April 2021 | Volume 9 | Article 665919 fcell - 09 - 665919 April 5 , 2021 Time : 10 : 32 # 5 Shi et al .

Crosstalk Between Actin and Caveolin - 1 hardly observed in CAV - 1 KO cells , while more prominent lamellipodia were localized around the leading edge in response to CAV - 1 depletion ( Supplementary Figure 4A ) . To test whether strong lamellipodia has consequences in membrane ruﬄing , we performed time - lapse analysis focusing on the cell edges and revealed that ruﬄing is much faster and broader , yet concomitantly not able to push membrane forward in CAV - 1 KO cells , whereas the protrusive ruﬄing activity in wild - type cells display less frequency and occurs only in the direction of movement ( Figure 4B and Supplementary Video 3 ) . AMP - activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) is a phylogenetically conserved intracellular energy sensor that has been shown to regulate small GTPases ( Salani et al . , 2012 ; Luo et al . , 2018 ) . By western blots , we noticed that the phosphorylation level of AMPK was signiﬁcantly increased in CAV - 1 KO cells , which could be rescued by full - length but not Y14F phospho - deﬁcient CAV - 1 , furthering indicating the essential role of site Tyr14 of CAV - 1 and conﬁrming the actin associated phenocopy of CAV - 1 KO with CAV - 1 ( Y14F ) mutation ( Figure 4C ) . In addition to RhoA , we also measured the GTP bound active levels of Rac1 and Cdc42 , and found that CAV - 1 depletion led to more active Rac1 and Cdc42 while their total protein levels remained unaﬀected ( Figure 4D and Supplementary Figure 4B ) . It has been already known that Rac1 induce the formation of lamellipodia and surface protrusions generated by actin - remodeling reactions ( Ridley et al . , 1992 , 2003 ) . In this regard , the thicker lamellipodia and active membrane ruﬄing observed in CAV - 1 KO cells ﬁt well as a consequence of the active AMPK and Rac1 . Furthermore , we evaluated and found an increase in the basal activation of lamellipodia related PAK1 and Coﬁlin ( Figure 4E ) . Importantly , the phosphorylated AMPK , PAK1 and Coﬁlin in CAV - 1 KO cells prefer to localize more to the cell edges where lamellipodia form ( Figure 4F and Supplementary Figures 4C – F ) . By treating with AMPK inhibitor compound C ( Dasgupta and Seibel , 2018 ) , both the distribution of phosphorylated Coﬁlin and lamellipodia width were restored to wild - type level in CAV - 1 KO cells ( Figure 4G ) , supporting the hypothesis that changes of actin protrusive network in the absence of CAV - 1 is regulated by AMPK - Rac1 - PAK1 - Coﬁlin signaling cascade . To test whether AMPK is the original cause for the actin network rearrangement in CAV - 1 depletion cells , we blocked AMPK activation and revealed the clear recovery of increased Rac1 - GTP and decreased RhoA - GTP , as well as elevated levels of phosphorylated PAK1 and Coﬁlin in CAV - 1 KO background ( Figure 4H ) . Taken together , we identiﬁed that sensitize AMPK mediated activities of GTPases in CAV - 1 depletion cells play essential roles for actin cytoskeleton remolding . Cell Morphology and Directional Migration Are Impaired by Depletion of CAV - 1 In order to explore whether the dysbiosis of actin assemblies in CAV - 1 depletion cells aﬀects cell shape and behavior , we recorded and measured cell morphology and directional cell migration . Most of wild - type U2OS cells exhibited a polarized morphology , with an elongated , polygonal shape . However , CAV - 1 depletion cells adopted a rounded , non - polarized shape with lamellipodia encircling the entire cell ( Figures 5A , B ) . Moreover , both the migration velocity and persistence were signiﬁcantly reduced in CAV - 1 KO cells quantiﬁed from cells on the custom - designed micro - channels and wound healing settings ( Figures 5C – E , Supplementary Figures 5A , B , and Supplementary Video 4 ) . Hepatocarcinoma Huh7 cells have no endogenous CAV - 1 ( Moreno - Caceres et al . , 2017 ) ( Supplementary Figures 5C , D ) and stable exogenously expression of CAV - 1 - mEGFP led to increased would healing ability ( Supplementary Figures 5E , F ) , further validating the role of CAV - 1 in cell migration . Collectively , our results demonstrate that CAV - 1 is required for the integrity and hemostasis of actin assemblies , and subsequent cell polarized morphology establishment and directional cell migration . DISCUSSION Despite accumulated information regarding the association between cortical actin ﬁlaments and membrane - located mechanosensitive caveolae with tension reservoir function ( Sinha et al . , 2011 ) , here we propose a feedback - driven model which demonstrate that the interplay between cytoplasmic actin assemblies and phosphorylated CAV - 1 coordinates cell migration ( Figure 5F ) . Aside from plasma membrane bounded CAV - 1 , we observed that the cellular CAV - 1 display actin associated motility by sliding along or / and undergoing retrograde ﬂow with actin ﬁlaments . Adequate contractility of actin ﬁlaments is essential for the phosphorylation of CAV - 1 on its critical site Tyr14 , and the subsequent distribution and motility of the intracellular CAV - 1 vesicles . Importantly , both CAV - 1 depletion and CAV - 1 phosphorylation on Tyr14 are able to aﬀect the active levels of AMPK , RhoA / Rac1 GTPase , and further disrupt the homostasis of contractile and protrusive structures of cytoplasmic actin , which lead to signiﬁcant changes in cell morphology and directional migration . In view of live cell imaging ﬁndings that cytoplasmic CAV - 1 vesicles not only move along actin ﬁlaments but also accompany with actomyosin transverse arcs for centripetal ﬂow , it is tempting to speculate that these “tracking” and “anchoring” function of elongated actin ﬁlament bundles to CAV - 1 vesicles perhaps requires molecular motor related contraction and consumes adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) to implement these dynamic association . This speculation is coincided with our results that inhibiting the motor activity of myosin II signiﬁcantly weakens the movement of the cytoplasmic CAV - 1 vesicles ( Figures 2C – E ) . Previous work by us reveals that vimentin intermediate ﬁlaments ( IFs ) function as physical barriers to restrain the intracellular traﬃcking of CAV - 1 vesicles ( Jiu , 2018 ; Shi et al . , 2020 ) . It is thus possible that the overall integrity and motility pattern of the cytoplasmic CAV - 1 are comprehensively regulated by both actin and IFs cytoskeletal networks . Moreover , traﬃcking of CAV - 1 from plasma membrane to perinuclear area has been reported by far dependent on microtubules ( Conrad et al . , 1995 ; Mundy et al . , 2002 ; Echarri et al . , 2012 ; Echarri and Del Pozo , 2015 ) .

All the data are from three independent experiments . ﬁlaments with dynamics of cellular CAV - 1 vesicles appears as a novel and complementary observation and will contribute to characterize the integrated cycling of caveolae . In addition , early studies have shown that the motility of CAV - 1 is bound to depolymerized actin ﬁbers by cytochalasin D application ( Mundy et al . , 2002 ; Thomsen et al . , 2002 ; Stoeber et al . , 2012 ) . Combined with our results , we argue that the cytoplasmic distribution and dynamics of caveolae are mostly dependent on the contractile and ﬁlamentous status of actin , which representing the abundant and stiﬀ of actin structures . We assume that CAV - 1 depleted U2OS cells which used in this study are considered to be deprivation of all three caveolin genes , because ( 1 ) CAV - 2 has been shown to be degraded in the absence of CAV - 1 through the proteasomal pathway ( Razani et al . , 2002a ) , and ( 2 ) CAV - 3 is a muscle speciﬁc caveolin which showed no endogenous expression in U2OS cells ( Galbiati et al . , 2001 ; Razani et al . , 2002b ) . In line with our ﬁnding , activation of AMPK by CAV - 1 depletion has been also detected in other human colon tumor cells ( Ha et al . , 2012 ) , indicating the activity control of CAV - 1 to AMPK is a broad regulation in cancer cells . Moreover , depletion of CAV1 led to AMPK activation followed by a p53 - dependent G1 cell - cycle arrest and autophagy , suggesting that elevated CAV1 may contribute to the ATP generation ( Ha et al . , 2012 ) . This is already a common view that there is mutual inhibition between the lamellipodia formation in cell frontness and the contractile stress ﬁber formation in cell backness ( Li et al . , 2003 ; Meili and Firtel , 2003 ; Xu et al . , 2003 ) during persistent migration . Thus , we propose that CAV - 1 depletion disequilibrates the balance between RhoA - mediated actomyosin bundles and Rac1 - mediated lamellipodia formation , which potentiates the interpretation of the cell migration defects . Furthermore , here we identify a previously unexpected role for CAV - 1 phosphorylation on site Tyr14 in inhibition of AMPK , and also disrupt the GTPase homeostasis and eventually cell migration . Other plasma membrane domains , such as clathrin - coated pits are functionally linked to actin - regulatory factors ( Girao et al . , 2008 ; Grassart et al . , 2014 ; Tweten et al . , 2017 ) , but an alignment with actin ﬁlaments is not apparent in those invaginations , suggesting that the association of caveolae with actin ﬁlaments fulﬁlls a particular function , and that diﬀerentiates them from clathrin - coated pits . It will be interesting to explore in the future why caveolae associate with certain actin ﬁlament structures but not with others , when and how this association is stimulated and regulate various cell behavior . MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell Culture and Transfections Human osteosarcoma ( U2OS ) cells and human hepatocarcinoma ( Huh7 ) cells were maintained in high glucose ( 4 . 5 g / L ) Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium ( DMEM ) ( # 06 - 1055 - 57 - 1A , Biological Industries , Kibbutz Beit - Haemek , Israel ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS , # 10270 - 106 , Gibco , Waltham , MA , United States ) , 100 U / ml Penicillin , 100 µ g / ml Streptomycin , and 4 mM L - Glutamine ( later referred as complete DMEM ) at 37 ◦ C in humidiﬁed atmosphere with 5 % CO 2 .

Crosstalk Between Actin and Caveolin - 1 TGGGGGCAAATACGTAGACT 3 (cid:48) for CAV - 1 - knockout . Transfected cells were detached at 24 h post - transfection and sorted with FACS Aria II ( BD Biosciences , Bedford , MA , United States ) , using low intensity GFP - expression pass gating , as single cell onto 96 - well plate supplemented DMEM containing 20 % FBS and 10 mM HEPES . CRISPR clones were cultivated for 2 weeks prior selecting clones with no discernible CAV - 1 protein expression using western blotting . Immunoﬂuorescence Microscopy Immunoﬂuorescence ( IF ) experiments were performed as previously described ( Jiu et al . , 2019 ) . Brieﬂy , cells were ﬁxed with 4 % PFA in PBS for 15 min at room temperature ( RT ) , washed three times with PBS , and permeabilized with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 in PBS for 5 min . Cells were then blocked in PBS supplemented with 5 % BSA . Both primary and secondary antibodies were applied onto cells and incubated at RT for 2 h . Alexa - conjugated phalloidin was added together with secondary antibody solutions onto cells . Alexa 647 - wheat germ agglutinin ( WGA ) ( # W32466 , Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc ) was used to visualize the plasma membrane . All IF data were obtained with Olympus SpinSR10 Ixplore spinning disk confocal microscope with UplanApo 100 × / 1 . 5 Oil objective ( Olympus Corporation , Tokyo , Japan ) . The pixel size was optimized properly to achieve the maximum resolution which was calculated to be 65 nm . For detection and measure of the cytoplasmic CAV - 1 tagged vesicles , the “Spots” tool of Imaris 9 . 2 ( Bitplane , Zurich , Switzerland ) was used with the conﬁguration deﬁned as 2 µ m for estimated XY diameter . The numbers and sizes of spots were calculated subsequently . For detection and measure of the lamellipodia width , a plot proﬁle perpendicular to the plasma membrane was made by using imageJ , and the peak zone was deﬁned as the width . Live Cell Imaging For live cell imaging , 35 mm glass - bottomed dishes ( MatTek Corporation , Ashland , MA , United States ) were coated with 10 µ g / ml ﬁbronectin ( # F2006 , Sigma Corp . , St . Louis , MO , United States ) in PBS for at least 3 h at 37 ◦ C , washed with PBS twice and immersed in complete DMEM medium without phenol red ( # 01 - 053 - 1A , Biological Industries , Kibbutz Beit - Haemek , Israel ) before seeding of cells . The time - lapse images of cells with transient transfection of CAV - 1 - mEGFP and mCherry - actin were acquired with Olympus cellSens Dimension system , consisting of an Olympus SpinSR10 Ixplore spinning disk confocal and a Yokogawa CSU - W1 confocal scanner . Appropriate ﬁlters , heated sample environment ( + 37 ◦ C ) , controlled 5 % CO 2 and UplanApo 100 × / 1 . 5 Oil objective ( Olympus Corporation , Tokyo , Japan ) was used . The recording was set as every 1 s for 200 s and one focal plane was recorded for all live cell videos . For tracking and speed measurement of CAV - 1 vesicles , the Imaris 9 . 2 ( Bitplane , Zurich , Switzerland ) “Track” module with globular - objects over time was used as in previous study ( Jiu , 2018 ) . Two micrometers estimated XY diameter , 5 µ m max distance and 3 max gap size were set for analyzing . Interference Reﬂection Microscopy ( IRM ) In order to image cells using IRM , we added a 50 / 50 beam splitter ( which reﬂects 50 % and transmits 50 % of the chosen wavelength ) in an empty ﬁlter cube of the Olympus IX73 inverted wideﬁeld ﬂuorescence microscopy ( Olympus Corporation , Tokyo , Japan ) . The 50 / 50 beam splitter partially reﬂects the 488 nm light to the sample , and then the light reﬂected from the sample is collected by the camera . The light reﬂected from the glass / medium interface ( I1 ) and the light reﬂected from the medium / cell plasma membrane interface ( I2 ) can interference , the optical path diﬀerence between I1 and I2 will result in a constructive bright signal or a destructive dark signal ( Verschueren , 1985 ; Mahamdeh and Howard , 2019 ) . Western Blotting ( WB ) All cell lysates were prepared by washing the cells once with PBS and scraping them into RIPA lysis buﬀer ( 50 mM Tris pH 7 . 4 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 % Triton X - 100 , 1 % sodium deoxycholate and 0 . 1 % SDS ) supplemented with 1 mM PMSF , 10 mM DTT , 40 µ g / ml DNase I and 1 µ g / ml of leupeptin , pepstatin , and aprotinin . All preparations were conducted at 4 ◦ C . Protein concentrations were determined with BCA Protein Assay kit ( # 23227 , Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc , Waltham , MA , United States ) and equal amounts of the total cell lysates were mixed with Laemmli Sample Buﬀer ( LSB ) , boiled , and ran on 12 . 5 % SDS - PAGE gels . Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane with Trans - Blot Turbo transfer system ( Bio - Rad , Hercules , CA , United States ) using Mini TGX gel transfer protocol . Membrane was blocked in 5 % BSA for 1 h at RT . Primary and secondary antibodies were diluted into fresh blocking buﬀer for overnight at 4 ◦ C and 1 h at RT , respectively . Proteins were detected from the membranes with SuperSigna West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate ( Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc , Waltham , MA , United States ) .

CAV - 1 - mCherry ( # 27705 ) , CAV - 1 - mEGFP ( # 27704 ) and GFP - AHPH ( # Cat68026 ) were from Addgene ( Watertown , MA , United States ) . All plasmids were sequenced for veriﬁcation . CAV - 1 ( Y14D ) - mEGFP and CAV - 1 ( Y14F ) - mEGFP was constructed by the overlap extension method , respectively ( Horton et al . , 1989 ) . To knockdown p190RhoGAP in U2OS cells , human p190RhoGAP ( GenBank NM _ 004491 . 4 ) targeting sequence ( 5 (cid:48) CCGGCGGTTGGTTCATGGGTACATTCTCGAGAATGTACCCATGAACCAACCGTTTTTT3 (cid:48) ) and control , non - targeting sequence ( 5 (cid:48) CCGGGGTTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGTCTCGA GACGTGACACGTTCGGAGAACCTTTTTG 3 (cid:48) ) were cloned into pLKO . 1 - TRC - copGFP - T2A - Puro vector , respectively .

Incubate the reaction mixture at 4 ◦ C for 1 h with gentle rocking . Then wash the beads three times with washing buﬀer and incubated with reducing sample buﬀer for 2 min at RT . Centrifuge the tube at 6 , 000 g for 2 min and heat the eluted samples for 5 min at 100 ◦ C . Anti - Rho , anti - Rac1 and anti Cdc42 antibodies ( # 8789 , # 8631 and # 8747 , Cell Signaling ) were used to test active RhoA , Rac1 , and Cdc42 by western blot , respectively . Traction Force Microscopy Traction force microscopy was used to measure the contractile forces that cells exerted upon their substrate as previously described ( Jiu et al . , 2017 ) . Brieﬂy , cells were cultured for 3 – 8 h on custom - made 35 - mm dishes ( Matrigen Life Technologies , CA , United States ) with ﬁbronectin - coated PAA gel with either 25 or 0 . 5 kPa stiﬀness . The diameter of 200 nm yellow - green ﬂuorescent ( 505 / 515 ) microspheres was immobilized to the surface of the gel . Images of the cells and the ﬂuorescent microspheres directly underneath the cells were acquired during the experiments and after cell detachment with trypsin . By comparing the reference image with the experimental image , we computed the cell - exerted displacement ﬁeld . From the displacement ﬁelds , and manual traces of the cell contours , together with knowledge of substrate stiﬀness , we computed the traction force ﬁelds using the approach of constrained Fourier - transform traction cytometry . From the traction ﬁelds , we calculated the strain energy by equation U = 1 2 Z T ( r ) . u ( r ) dA It was the total deformation energy produced by the cells through applying the traction on the surface of the substrate , which suggested an integrated measure of cell traction . Statistical Analysis Statistical data analyses were performed with Excel ( Microsoft , Redmond , WA , United States ) and Graphpad Prism 8 ( GraphPad Software , La Jolla , CA ) . Normality of the data was examined with the Shapiro - Wilk test and a quantile - quantile plot . For the data following normal distribution , Student’s two - sample unpaired t - test was used . If data did not follow normal distribution , Mann - Whitney u - test for two independent samples was conducted . One - way ANOVA followed by a Tukey’s post - hoc test was used to evaluate diﬀerences between three or more groups . For analyzing the CAV - 1 movement rate , the mean speed of each vesicle within 200 s live cell video was measured by Imaris “Track” module and pooled together to calculate the average rate with color bars indicating the tracked mean speed ranging from 0 to 0 . 4 µ m / s ( Figure 2F ) .
