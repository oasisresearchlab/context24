J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 2 Summary Background Health care workers ( HCWs ) have a high risk of infection with coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) , especially those treating patients with confirmed or suspected diagnosis ( front - line ) . Aim To evaluate the incidence and prevalence of the COVID - 19 infection among HCWs and to analyse the risk factors and the clinical characteristics among infected ones . Methods Observational , retrospective , single - center study ( Centro Hospitalar e Universitário de Coimbra , Portugal ) . Data were collected from March 1 to June 30 , 2020 . Findings Overall , 211 ( 2 . 63 % ) out of 8037 HCWs were diagnosed with COVID - 19 . Most of the infections occurred during the early stage of disease outbreak . Among the infected HCWs , only 20 . 9 % ( n = 44 ) were from the front - line . Both front - line and non - front - line HCWs were exposed primarily to patients ( 48 . 6 % in both groups ) , but the non - front - line were ( presumably ) more infected by colleagues ( 10 . 8 % vs 24 . 8 % , p = 0 . 04 ) . Front - line HCWs performed more family isolation than non - front - line ( 88 . 9 % vs 82 . 5 % , p > 0 . 05 ) and presumably less family members were infected in the former group ( 19 . 4 % vs 26 . 3 % , p > 0 . 05 ) . The proportion of HCWs with asymptomatic infection was statistically significantly lower in the front - line group ( 2 . 4 % vs 19 . 9 % , p = 0 . 05 ) . Conclusion The prevention and control actions implemented were effective in mitigating the COVID - 19 outbreak ; HCW infections occurred mainly in the early stages . Non - front - line HCWs were at a higher risk , warranting specific attention and interventions targeting this group . Keywords : COVID - 19 ; SARS - CoV - 2 ; health care workers ; infection . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 3 Introduction On December 2019 , the outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) emerged in Wuhan , China . [ 1 - 3 ] On the January 30 , 2020 , the World Health Organization ( WHO ) declared a public health emergency of international concern . Later , on March 11 , 2020 , the outbreak was characterized as a pandemic , mainly because the virus was highly infectious and increasingly widespread throughout the world . It causes a severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) termed “SARS - CoV - 2” . [ 4 ] Contrary to the already known SARS , COVID - 19 was less virulent , with an expected lower mortality rate , but longer incubation periods which results in a significant number of asymptomatic carriers . [ 5 - 7 ] The number of confirmed cases continually grows globally , and nine months after the outbreak more than 32 . 7 million cases were reported and more than 991 , 000 deaths . [ 8 ] Health care workers ( HCWs ) have been successfully fighting against COVID - 19 , facing a substantial risk of SARS - CoV - 2 infection , with enormous personal and professional sacrifices . [ 9 - 12 ] However , asymptomatic transmissions could further increase the risk of superspreading in hospitals [ 13 ] and , due to exposure , HCWs are a particularly at risk population . Although the evidence has remained scarce , few studies have determined the prevalence , exposure information , and clinical presentation of this infection in HCWs . Preliminary studies point to an overall infection rate of 0 . 89 to 11 . 1 % [ 14 - 20 ] and to a case fatality rate of 0 . 69 % . [ 17 ] However , they refer to specific contexts and countries ( Netherlands , China , USA , Italy and Spain ) which responded with specific measures to this pandemic . [ 14 - 20 ] Different countries , adopting different health and politic policies may have distinctive results , but all are important to adjust and optimize future responses . This study aimed to evaluate the incidence and prevalence of COVID - 19 infection among HCWs in one of the largest Portuguese Hospitals , analysing the risk factors and J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 4 the clinical characteristics of affected HCWs . We were especially interested in comparing the risk between HCWs who were and were not in the frontline of care . Methods Participants , study design and setting This was an observational , single - center study , retrospectively collecting epidemiologic andexposure data , clinical information and treatment specificities using complementary sources of data , collected both by the Occupational Health Department and by the Human Resources department . These data were collected by telephone interview and through self - reported forms and relate to the period from March 1 to June 30 , 2020 . The “Centro Hospitalar e Universitário de Coimbra , EPE” ( CHUC ) is a large comprehensive tertiary and university hospital , with more than 1700 beds and 8037 HCWs . It is formed by a network of hospital units ( 2 general adult , 2 maternities , 1 paediatric , and 1 psychiatric unit ) , with services and technologies structured and integrated to provide a humanized , complete , close , reliable , and transparent service to society . The ethical approval was granted by the CHUC Ethics Committee ( CHUC - 058 - 20 ) . This study followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology ( STROBE ) reporting guideline . [ 21 ] COVID - 19 diagnosis procedures A semiquantitative real - time reverse transcriptase - polymerase chain reaction ( 45 cycles ) targeting SARS - CoV - 2 E - gene was performed on nasopharyngeal swabs ( based on the standard technique as recommended by the WHO and the National Guidelines ) . [ 22 , 23 ] Swabs were immediately placed for transportation , accommodated and delivered to CHUC central laboratory . The swab collection was performed as soon as possible after a HCW presented any suspicious clinical symptoms according to the National Guidelines , [ 23 ] regardless of J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 5 the background rate or exposure . As such , the sample was non - probabilistic by convenience throughout the study period . The unit of measurement for this study was the number of positive HCWs and not the number of positive samples . Exposure factors , characteristics and outcomes Age , sex , and job categories : physicians , nurses , health care assistants , and others ( pharmaceuticals , technical assistants , diagnosis and therapeutic technicians ) were collected for the whole population . In HCWs that were infected with COVID - 19 we also collected : if they were working in the front - line ( defined as those who worked in wards or departments that provided direct care to patients with confirmed or suspected COVID - 19 ; non - front line included all the wards or departments that are dedicated to standard hospital functioning and do not provide direct care to patients with confirmed or suspected COVID - 19 ) , body mass index ( BMI ) , presumed exposure to confirmed cases ( patients , colleagues , family , unknown ) , if they performed family isolation ( defined as living isolated from their family members ) , if the disease was transmitted to family , and their comorbidities , signs and symptoms ( with duration ) , risk factors , and outcomes ( e . g . hospitalization , intensive care unit admission , death ) . Statistical Analysis To characterise HCWs with confirmed COVID - 19 epidemiologically , we estimated the prevalence , the cumulative incidence , the average incidence rate , and the morbidity . Continuous variables were described as means and standard deviations ( SD ) and categorical variables as frequency and percentages . To compare the individual characteristics , exposure information , signs and symptoms , and outcomes between the front - line and the non - front - line HCWs we used the Student’s t - test ( continuous variables ) and the χ 2 test or Fisher’s exact test ( categorical variables ) . [ 24 ] A 2 - sided P < 0 . 05 was considered statistically significant . All analyses were performed using SPSS statistical software version 23 . 0 ( IBM Corp ) . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 6 Results COVID - 19 incidence and differences per professional group In total , 211 ( 2 . 63 % ) out of 8037 HCWs in CHUC were diagnosed with COVID - 19 . The characteristics of the population , as well as of the diagnosed and non - diagnosed professionals are shown in Table I . Nurses represent 37 . 3 % of the total workforce but 52 . 6 % of the infected ( n = 111 ) , being the most affected professional group , followed by the health care assistants ( 22 . 2 % of the workforce and 23 . 2 % of the infected ) , physicians ( 21 . 3 % of the population and 16 . 1 % of the infected ) , and lastly by the other HCWs ( 19 . 2 % of the population and 8 . 1 % of the infected ) . The cumulative incidence of HCWs infected was 2 . 66 , with an incidence rate of 0 . 007 HCW per month and an average morbidity of 1 . 48 . All these indices corroborate the nurses being the most affected . No deaths were observed . Monthly evolution of cases Figure 1 shows the evolution of monthly COVID - 19 infected HCWs in CHUC . It can be observed that most HCWs’ infections occurred during the early stage of the outbreak ( March and April 2020 ) . From March to April a decrease was observed in the rate of physicians’ infection , while a significant increase was observed in health care assistants . Nurses summed more infected individuals than all other together , in these two first periods . The number of HCWs infected with COVID - 19 decreased dramatically in May and June 2020 . However , the number of newly confirmed cases with COVID - 19 in Portugal continued to increase . Exposure differences between frontand non - front - line HCWs Among the 211 infected HCWs , only 20 . 9 % ( n = 44 ) were from the COVID - 19’ front - line ( Table II ) . As expected , both front - line and non - front - line HCWs were exposed primarily to patients ( 48 . 6 % in both groups ) , but the non - front - line were significantly more ( presumably ) infected by colleagues ( 10 . 8 % vs 24 . 8 % , p = 0 . 04 ) . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 7 Front - line HCWs performed more family isolation than non - front - line ( 88 . 9 % vs 82 . 5 % , p > 0 . 05 ) and less family members were infected in the former group ( 19 . 4 % vs 26 . 3 % , P > 0 . 05 ) . Also , the proportion of HCWs with asymptomatic infection was statistically significantly lower in the front - line ( 2 . 4 % vs 19 . 9 % , p = 0 . 05 ) ( Table II ) . Clinical characteristics and treatment specificities of HCWs with COVID - 19 Clinical characteristics of HCWs with confirmed COVID - 19 are shown in Table III . The three most common comorbidities among all HCWs infected were respiratory disease ( 18 . 6 % ) , hypertension ( 13 . 4 % ) and cardiovascular disease ( 4 . 7 % ) . The six most common signs and symptoms were asthenia ( 64 . 2 % ) , myalgias ( 61 . 5 % ) , anosmia ( 53 . 9 % ) , headaches ( 53 . 4 % ) , cough ( 50 . 7 % ) and ageusia ( 50 % ) . There was no difference between front - line and non - front - line HCWs in subgroups of comorbidities , the majority of signs and symptoms [ except for cough , more frequent in front - line ( 66 . 7 % vs 46 . 6 % , p = 0 . 02 ) ] , risk factors , or severity criteria . The mean days with signs and symptoms was 23 . 19 days ( SD = 16 . 9 ) , being significantly higher in front - line HCWs [ 30 . 4 ( 18 . 2 ) vs 21 . 5 ( 16 . 2 ) , p = 0 . 01 ] . Outcomes Table IV shows the outcomes of HCWs with COVID - 19 . Overall , all HCWs were followed up by the occupational health department , 11 . 6 % reported an additional follow - up by their family physician , 13 . 2 % required a visit to the emergency department and 2 . 3 % were hospitalized . None of the HCWs were admitted to the intensive care unit and no deaths were observed . Front - line HCWs have gone to the emergency department more often than the non - front - line HCWs ( 24 . 3 % vs 10 . 2 % , p = 0 . 05 ) . Discussion This was the first Portuguese and one of the few international studies providing insights into the COVID - 19 infection among HCWs during the outbreak . This was based in a J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 8 large comprehensive tertiary and university hospital , from the Central Administrative Region of the Country , less affected than the Northern and Southern ones . Overall , 2 . 63 % of HCWs were infected with COVID - 19 . This infection rate was similar to previous international studies , that reported rates between 0 . 89 to 2 . 94 % . [ 14 - 17 , 19 ] Moreover , the results also showed that front - line HCWs were less infected than non - front - line HCWs ( 0 . 55 vs 2 . 08 % , respectively ) . This trend was also confirmed by previous studies [ 15 ] and could be explained by different reasons . The more likely explanation is that the front - line services were organised primarily and as a priority compared to the non - front - line ones , and thus , have had faster and better performance , circulation , hygiene and safety protocol training , as well as have had more access to the mandatory full body personal protective equipment ( PPE ) . It was well reported that insufficient PPE was available at the beginning of the outbreak for “non - essential wards” ( non - front - line ones ) . In addition , at the beginning of the outbreak , patients who were admitted to hospital without respiratory symptoms and / or any other symptoms were not tested for COVID - 19 and this led to several asymptomatic cases that were only confirmed at a later date . Our results indicated that most HCWs were infected during the early stage of the COVID - 19 outbreak ( March and April ) and that after the different infection prevention and control actions were taken by the hospital , they were very effective in preventing or limiting transmissions . This dynamic and beneficial change was the result of a set of strict prevention and control actions that the hospital adopted . In March , a hospital building ( former general hospital ) was assigned to receive all the exclusive cases of COVID - 19 . This allowed physical isolation between the different hospital buildings of all suspected cases , confirmed or not with COVID - 19 . Additionally , all procedures , use of PPE per service , circuit of patients and HCWs , and the criteria for admission in the other hospital buildings were also standardized , hospital visits were prohibited and actions to reduce HCW’s circulation were implemented , the accumulation of jobs in other hospitals by HCWs was suspended , teleworking was proposed , the use of a J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 9 surgical mask in any non - attendance hospital area was imposed and finally the COVID - 19 contingency plan was created , including a “crisis office” ( which provided accommodation for HCWs , were responsible for COVID - 19 testing , among others ) with support telephone lines . In April , five more dedicated services were commenced ( also exclusive to COVID - 19 ) ; systematic screening of elective surgical patients ( and for all scheduled admissions ) was mandatory and " special wards " were created to receive patients who were only waiting for the results of the COVID - 19 test and , after it , they were referred to the dedicated services of COVID - 19 or to general care . In accordance with other studies , nurses are the most infected professional group . This may be justified by its philosophy of caring , with great proximity and a longer intervention time . [ 25 ] In addition , nurses are the most numerous professional group in a hospital and who perform the most technical procedures , maintaining a greater direct contact with infected patients . A total of 0 . 58 % of HCWs with COVID - 19 were asymptomatic and this corroborates the results of previous studies . [ 15 ] Evidence about the risk of transmission from asymptomatic carriers is still scarce , although the viral load of asymptomatic patients seems to be similar to those detected in symptomatic patients , which could support the transmission chains and super - spread in hospitals . [ 7 , 26 ] Asymptomatic HCWs might become a transmission chain for patients , colleagues and the community . These were more often non - front - line HCWs . Although fever was very common in other studies , in our study it was not frequent . [ 14 , 27 ] Other symptoms such as cough , myalgias , headaches , anosmia and ageusia were more common . Front - line HCWs spent more days with signs and symptoms when compared with non - front - line HCWs , which could be explained by higher viral loads . In general , and after the presence of signs and symptoms , all HCWs were tested for COVID - 19 and started immediate self - isolation and treatment if needed . This may indicate that early diagnosis and treatment provide a favorable outcomes for HCWs J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 10 and patients with COVID - 19 . In addition and contrary to other studies , no HCWs have died or been in intensive care . [ 17 , 28 ] Our results should be interpreted while considering some limitations . Firstly , we cannot deny that probably missed asymptomatic cases among all HCWs could preclude lower estimates of infection rates , morbidity , and all the sequential analysis . A seropositive analysis across the entire workforce would probably have revealed more cases , as suggested by a prospective multicentre study in the UK hospitals ( 18 % , 95 % Cl 17 . 0 to 18 . 9 ) . [ 29 ] Secondly , and based on the previous limitation , probably we also missed asymptomatic cases in family members . Family members of HCWs were tested for COVID - 19 if they had symptoms , as recommended . This could have led also to lower estimates of infection . Thirdly , although there has been a large reduction in cases of infected HCWs ( and these are most likely due to the actions taken by the hospital ) , we cannot confirm that with certainty , much less establish causality . At last , some cases of infected HCWs had been fully treated by family physicians and this led to a report of exposure and clinical characteristics delay and this probably wasn’t very accurate , imposing some uncontrolled level of recall bias . Conclusions The infection rate was very similar to those reported in the literature . Non - front - line HCWs were at a higher risk of COVID - 19 infection during the early stages of the outbreak . For this reason , specific attention and interventions targeting this group should be promoted . Author contributions RF , AAM and AM designed and coordinated the study .
