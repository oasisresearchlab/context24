Similarity and the development of rules Dedre Gentner a , * , Jose´ Medina b a Department of Psychology , Northwestern University , 2029 Sheridan Road , Evanston , IL 60208 , USA b Department of Philosophy , Northwestern University , Evanston , IL 60208 , USA Abstract Similarity - based and rule - based accounts of cognition are often portrayed as opposing accounts . In this paper we suggest that in learning and development , the process of compar - ison can act as a bridge between similarity - based and rule - based processing . We suggest that comparison involves a process of structural alignment and mapping between two representa - tions . This kind of structure - sensitive comparison process – which may be triggered either by experiential or symbolic juxtapositions – has a twofold signiﬁcance for cognitive develop - ment . First , as a learning mechanism , comparison facilitates the grasp of structural common - alities and the abstraction of rules ; and , second , as a mechanism for the application and extension of previously acquired knowledge , comparison processes facilitate the application of abstract knowledge to new instances .

And as Rips ( 1994 ) , notes , ‘much of the deductive work that we carry out from day to day consists of . . . ‘steps so routine that they seem not to require deduction at all . ’ For example , when given two options , we know that if we reject one , we are committed to the other ; and this reasoning appears to us so natural that we are not aware of invoking the abstract inference schema of modus tollendo ponens ( P or Q , not P ; therefore Q ) .
