Major progress has been made in the determination of the three - dimensional structures of many of the components . Recently , there has been an explosion in the identiﬁcation and characterization of clathrin binding partners . This review integrates the structural and biochemical information that is cur - rently available to present a uniﬁed view of how many clathrin binding partners interact with clathrin . Key words : clathrin , coated vesicles , endocytosis , internalization Received 2 May 2002 , revised and accepted for publi - cation 8 May 2002 Clathrin - coated vesicles mediate protein and lipid transport between intracellular compartments in the regulated se - cretory and endocytic pathways of all compartmentalized cells ( 1 ) . Clathrin - mediated endocytosis is used for the inter - nalization of ligand - bearing cell surface receptors ( receptor - mediated endocytosis ) ; to regulate the levels of growth factor receptors , neurotransmitter receptors , and neurotransmitter transporters on the cell surface ( sequestration ) ; and for the internalization of previously exocytosed synaptic vesicle membrane proteins and lipids ( synaptic vesicle recycling ) ( 2 , 3 ) . Aberrations in the clathrin pathway have been associ - ated with a diverse range of diseases including familial hyper - cholesterolemia , heredity hemochromatosis , leukemias , Alzh - eimer’s disease , Huntington’s disease , Hermansky – Pudlack syndrome , distal myopathy , and DiGeorge and / or velocardi - ofacial syndromes ( 1 ) . The pathway has also been co - opted by many viruses seeking entry into host cells , and for their subsequent immune evasion ( 4 ) . Because of the diverse and important roles that clathrin - mediated vesicular trafﬁc plays in cells , study of this pathway has attracted the interest of a broad community of researchers . Clathrin - Coated Vesicles Clathrin exists in two predominant forms in cells . The solution form of clathrin is the triskelion ( (cid:1) 650kDa ) , consisting of 3 513 identical heavy chains ( 192kDa ) and 3 light chains ( 22 – 28kDa ) . Clathrin has the property of self - assembly . Triskelia oligomerize to form cage - or basket - like structures ( 2 ) . If the polymerization reaction takes place on a cell membrane , the membrane is mechanically deformed into the shape of a clathrin - coated pit . Following an energy - dependent scission reaction , clathrin - coated pits are converted into clathrin - coated vesicles . The rate of clathrin self - assembly is very slow under physiological conditions , and therefore additional factors are required to promote clathrin assembly in vivo ( 1 ) . In addition to clathrin , the major resident coat proteins of neuronal plasma membrane - derived clathrin - coated vesicles are AP - 2 , AP180 , and auxilin , which are present in amounts stoichiometric with clathrin ( 5 – 7 ) . There is strong genetic evi - dence that all of these proteins play important roles in endo - cytosis in vivo ( 8 – 10 ) . Clathrin makes direct interactions with AP - 2 , AP180 and auxilin , and both AP180 and auxilin make direct interactions with AP - 2 . AP180 and AP - 2 interact with inositol lipids and inositol polyphosphates including PIP 2 , while auxilin interacts with the uncoating ATPase Hsc70 ( 1 ) . AP - 2 also interacts with membranous cargo molecules such as the LDL receptor and synaptotagmin , as well as with a large number of effector molecules that transiently associate with coated vesicles ( 3 ) ( Figure 1 ) . Both AP180 and auxilin are monomeric proteins that are expressed exclusively in neurons ( 11 , 12 ) , although they both have homologs that are expressed outside the nervous system , called CALM and GAK , respectively ( 13 , 14 ) . AP - 2 is a ubiquitously expressed member of the tetrameric adaptor family that is found exclus - ively associated with plasma membrane derived clathrin - coated vesicles . AP - 1 is the homolog that replaces AP - 2 in trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) derived clathrin - coated vesicles . AP - 1 and AP - 2 contain related subunits , that are now called b 1 , g , m 1 , s 1 ( AP - 1 ) and b 2 , a , m 2 , s 2 ( AP - 2 ) ( 15 ) . Additional homologs of the tetrameric adaptors have been identiﬁed through proteomics approaches , which include AP - 3 ( b 3 , d , m 3 , s 3 ) and AP - 4 ( b 4 , e , m 4 , s 4 ) . AP - 3 is involved in ves - icle formation from endosomes , and AP - 4 may play a role in vesicle formation at the TGN ( 16 ) . While AP - 3 binds to clathrin in vitro , and colocalizes with clathrin in vivo ( 17 ) , it has also been shown to be able to function in the formation of synaptic - like microvesicles from the endosomes of neuro - endocrine cells in a clathrin - independent reaction ( 18 ) . AP - 4 has been localized to the TGN ( 16 ) , and contains putative clathrin binding sites ( 19 ) . However , it was reported that AP - 4 does not colocalize with clathrin , and could not be isolated from clathrin - coated vesicles ( 16 ) . Whether AP - 3 and AP - 4 are biologically relevant clathrin binding partners requires further investigation . Lafer Figure1 : The clathrin interaction web . Proteins that interact directly with clathrin are shown in pink . Cytoskeletal proteins are shown in purple , proteins that participate in the scission reaction are shown in blue , and lipids are shown in orange . Clathrin assembly has been reconstituted from puriﬁed com - ponents in vitro ( 20 ) . AP - 1 , AP - 2 , AP180 and auxilin can all promote clathrin assembly in vitro . AP180 is four times more efﬁcient than the other proteins at promoting assembly ( 20 ) , and assembles the most homogeneously sized coats ( 21 , 22 ) . These in vitro clathrin assembly assays are generally carried out under slightly acidic conditions ( pH6 . 5 – 6 . 7 ) , since as - sembly by individual assembly proteins at physiological pH is poor . However , an AP180 – AP - 2 complex cooperatively as - sembles clathrin with high efﬁciency at physiological pH ( 23 ) . Interactions between AP180 , AP - 2 , and PIP 2 are important for clathrin to polymerize on a lipid monolayer . AP180 is suf - ﬁcient to initiate clathrin polymerization on lipid monolayers containing PIP 2 , whereas AP - 2 is insufﬁcient . However , to form deeply invaginated coated pits , both AP180 and AP - 2 are required ( 24 ) . Peptides that disrupt AP180 and AP - 2 - mediated clathrin assembly in vitro inhibit synaptic vesicle endocytosis in vivo ( 19 , 25 ) , supporting roles for AP180 and AP - 2 in clathrin assembly in vivo . Drosophila in which the AP180 homolog was knocked out have reduced numbers of synaptic vesicles , and a broadening of the distribution of syn - aptic vesicle sizes , supporting a role for AP180 in controlling vesicle size during the polymerization reaction in vivo ( 9 ) . It is not clear whether auxilin plays a role in clathrin assembly 514 Trafﬁc 2002 ; 3 : 513 – 520 in vivo . However , it is known that auxilin plays a key role in the uncoating reaction in vivo . Knockout of the yeast auxilin homolog results in an uncoating defect ( 10 ) , as does RNAi inhibition of synthesis of the Caenorhabditis elegans auxilin homolog ( 26 ) . It is believed that auxilin is localized to clathrin - coated pits via its interactions with clathrin , and then recruits and activates Hsc70 , which serves as the uncoating ATPase to catalyze the uncoating reaction ( 27 ) . This model is sup - ported both by experiments in which the uncoating reaction has been reconstituted from puriﬁed components in vitro ( 27 , 28 ) , and by experiments in which microinjection of an Hsc70 binding deﬁcient auxilin was found to inhibit uncoat - ing at the squid giant synapse in vivo ( 29 ) . The adaptor proteins play a major role in selecting which cargo molecules get incorporated into clathrin - coated ves - icles . Many cargo molecules are recruited into clathrin - coated pits via a YXX F motif that interacts with the m subunits of the tetrameric adaptors ( 15 ) . Some cargo molecules are recruited via a dileucine - based motif which interacts with the b 1 subunit of AP - 1 ( 15 ) . GGAs ( Golgi - localized gamma - ear - containing ARF - binding proteins ) can also serve as mono - meric adaptors in the TGN for the recruitment of proteins that contain acidic cluster - dileucine motifs ( 29 , 30 ) . While they are Clathrin – Protein Interactions Figure2 : Orientation of three terminal domains in the lattice of a clathrin coat . Shown is a view from the membrane toward the clathrin coat , to illustrate the approximate positions under a vertex of three terminal domains from three different clathrin triskelions . The propeller domains are in yellow , and the ﬁrst a - zigzag after each terminal domain is in red . The position of the site between blades one and two for a clathrin box peptide is shown by including the ordered portion of the b 3 chain of AP - 3 ( green ) , as seen in the structure of a terminal domain - peptide complex ( 54 ) . The distal legs of clathrin triskelions that emanate from the three terminal domains are represented as cream - colored tubes , and the proximal legs of the triskelion centered on this vertex are shown as ochre tubes . These leg segments lie ‘behind’ the terminal domains in this view – that is , behind the plane of the page – and the terminal domains should be imagined to project forward toward the reader . The model shows that there are numerous closely spaced sites for clathrin box proteins and that even the closest sites do not interfere with each other .

It was found that the LDL recep - tor interacts directly with the N - terminal domain of the clathrin heavy chain through an NPXY motif in vitro ( 32 ) , indi - cating that cargo molecules may also be recruited into coated vesicles by direct interactions with clathrin . Clathrin Accessory Proteins In recent years , there has been an explosion in the identiﬁ - cation of clathrin binding partners ( 1 ) . In addition to the resi - 515 Trafﬁc 2002 ; 3 : 513 – 520 dent coat proteins and adaptor molecules discussed above , a large number of proteins have been described which transi - ently associate with coated vesicles ( 3 ) . These interactions are thought to be important , both to give temporal order to the endocytosis reaction , and to regulate the various steps . Moreover , each of the clathrin binding proteins often makes multiple interactions with other components of the endocytic apparatus , as part of an interaction web ( Figure 1 ) . The four molecules that make the largest number of interactions within this web are clathrin , AP - 2 , PIP 2 , and Eps15 . Interac - tions with PIP 2 are important to concentrate factors at the membrane ( 33 ) . Interactions with Eps15 may be important to link the endocytic machinery with the actin cystoskeleton ( 34 ) . Proteins involved in every step of the coated vesicle Lafer Figure3 : Alignment of the well - characterized clathrin binding sites . The large number of clathrin binding sites that have been recently characterized are best ﬁt by the consensus sequence pL F p F p ( p Ω polar ; F Ω hydrophobic ; * Ω C - terminus ) . Residues that match the consen - sus sequence are in bold . In addition , residues that are similar , allowing conservative amino acid substitutions ( D / E , S / T , N / Q , L / I / M ) , are surrounded by colored boxes that indicate their degree of similarity : 100 % , black ; (cid:1) 75 % , royal blue ; (cid:1) 50 % , turquoise ; (cid:1) 20 % , gray . cycle interact with AP - 2 ; so AP - 2 may serve to coordinate the progressive steps of the pathway from cargo recruitment and assembly all the way to uncoating ( 35 ) . Many of the interactions in the web are regulated by cycles of protein phosphorylation / dephosphorylation ( 36 ) and lipid phos - phorylation / dephosphorylation ( 37 ) , which may be critical for keeping the coat proteins from inappropriately associating with each other in the cytosol , or from polymerizing onto in - tracellular storage vesicles such as synaptic vesicles . The clathrin binding accessory proteins that have been iden - tiﬁed can be conceptually organized into four functional classes , although some proteins may belong to more than one group . The ﬁrst class are involved in cargo selection and 516 Trafﬁc 2002 ; 3 : 513 – 520 in the initiation of clathrin - coated pit formation at the plasma membrane . The second class are involved in interactions with the actin cytoskeleton . The third class are involved in clathrin - coated vesicle scission , and the fourth class are involved in vesicle uncoating . Eps15 , and the clathrin binding proteins Epsin and Hrs are candidates for proteins likely to play roles in cargo selection and in the assembly reaction . Hrs , eps15 and epsin each contain a UIM ( ubiguitin - interacting - motif ) which may be involved in recruiting ubiquitinated cargo mol - ecules into clathrin coated pits ( 38 ) . Eps15 is found transi - ently associated with the growing edges of clathrin - coated pits ( 39 ) . Eps15 interacts with many NPF motif containing clathrin binding proteins through 3 EH domains found in the N - terminal half of the protein , and with the ear domain of the Clathrin – Protein Interactions Figure4 : Self - homology plots of AP180 and Epsin . Self - homology plots generated with PLALIGN ( 73 ) of the yeast and mammalian homologs of AP180 and Epsin reveal that the C - terminal domains of both AP180 and Epsin are highly repetitive . Notice that both the size of the C - terminal domains , and the number of repeats they contain , are greater in the mammalian homologs than in the yeast homologs . a subunit of AP - 2 through multiple DPF motifs found in the C - terminal half of the protein ( 3 ) . Mutagenesis of the AP2 binding site on eps15 revealed that the interaction is essential for receptor - mediated endocytosis ( 40 ) . While eps15 does not have any intrinsic clathrin assembly activity , it stimulates the clathrin assembly activity of AP180 and AP - 2 ( 41 ) . In ad - dition , the yeast homolog of Eps15 binds to and activates the Arp2 / 3 complex which nucleates actin polymerization ( 34 ) ; hence it may also play a role in linking clathrin - coated pit formation to speciﬁc sites in the actin - based cytoskeleton . Epsin is structurally very similar to AP180 , with an N - terminal ENTH domain that interacts with inositol lipids , and a rela - tively unstructured C - terminal domain that contains multiple binding sites for clathrin , AP - 2 , and eps15 ( 42 ) . Epsin has been shown to assemble clathrin in vitro ( 42 ) , and to be essential for endocytosis in vivo ( 43 ) . However , unlike AP180 , it is not found in signiﬁcant amounts in clathrin - coated ves - icles ( 43 ) . Hrs is an eps15 and clathrin binding protein that 517 Trafﬁc 2002 ; 3 : 513 – 520 has been reported to be involved in the recruitment of clathrin to early endosomes ( 44 ) . The clathrin binding proteins HIP1R , ankyrin , ACK1 , and ACK2 may be involved in a reor - ganization of the actin cytoskeleton that may be required for clathrin - coated vesicle formation ( 41 , 42 ) . The clathrin binding proteins synaptojanin and amphiphysin are involved in a sub - network of interactions with dynamin , en - dophilin and syndapin , that are believed to be important for the scission reaction . Dynamin is a GTPase which forms rings around the necks of budding coated vesicles ( 47 ) . Mutations in dynamin that inactivate its GTPase activity result in an ac - cumulation of clathrin - coated pits ( 1 ) . Both synaptojanin and endophilin are lipid - modifying enzymes , and may contribute to lipid rearrangements that promote the scission reaction ( 37 ) . Synaptojanin is also believed to play a role in the uncoating re - action , since there is an increase in the number of clathrin - coated vesicles in synaptojanin knock - out mice ( 33 ) . This sup - Lafer ports the idea that cycles of inositol lipid phosphorylation and de - phosphorylation accompany cycles of coated vesicle as - sembly and uncoating . The giant protein p619 is another clathrin binding protein that may play a role in uncoating , since it also interacts with the uncoating ATPase Hsc70 ( 48 ) . Clathrin Binding Sites There are multiple protein interacting regions within the clathrin heavy chain . Early studies focused on binding sites within the C - terminal two - thirds of the molecule ( 49 – 52 ) . In recent years , the 55kDa N - terminal domain of the clathrin heavy chain ( TD ) , which is the globular region found at the distal end of each triskelion leg , has emerged as a major protein - interacting domain ( 53 ) . Mutagenesis studies identiﬁed the sequence 817 SLLDLD 822 as critical for clathrin binding in the b 3a subunit of AP - 3 , and when this was aligned with sequences within clathrin binding regions of the b 1 subunit of AP - 1 , the b 2 subunit of AP - 2 , arrestin 3 , b - arrestin 1 , amphiphysin I and amphiphysin II , a consen - sus motif for clathrin binding of L ( L , I ) ( D , E , N ) ( L , F ) ( D , E ) was proposed ( 17 ) . The structure of TD was solved by X - ray crystallography , and found to be a 7 - blade b - propeller join - ed to an a - helical zigzag linker ( 53 ) . In an assembled coat , three TDs from three different clathrin molecules are found in close proximity under each vertex , pointing towards the membrane and accessible for various interactions ( 2 ) ( Fig - ure 2 ) . Structures of TD complexed with two binding - site peptides were also solved by X - ray crystallography ( 54 ) . Clathrin - binding peptides from the b 3a subunit of AP - 3 and b - arrestin 1 were each found bound in the groove formed between blades 1 and 2 of the TD b - propeller . The principal contact sites included the sequence LIEFE in b - arrestin 2 and LLDLD in the b - 3a subunit of AP - 3 . The ﬁrst leucine of each peptide was found in a small hydrophobic pocket . The second and fourth hydrophobic residues were found in a larger hydrophobic pocket . The ﬁfth negatively charged residue was found ﬂanked by positively charged amino acids , and the central hydrophilic residue was found pro - jecting outward into the solvent . Consistent with earlier suggestions ( 17 ) , a consensus clathrin binding site of LLpL ( – ) was dubbed the ‘clathrin box’ . Indeed the ‘clathrin box’ has been useful in predicting clathrin binding sites that had not been previously char - acterized . However , as more clathrin binding sites have been mapped , a number of them do not completely con - form to the original deﬁnition of the clathrin - box ( 55 ) . The term ‘type II clathrin box’ was introduced to describe clathrin binding site variants such as PWDLW and LMDLA that are found in the mammalian epsins and amphiphysins ( 56 ) . The only canonical clathrin box found in mammalian AP180 is located in the N - terminal ENTH domain , and not in the C - terminal clathrin assembly domain , in an inaccess - ible region in the three - dimensional structure ( 57 ) . However , another variant of the clathrin box , dubbed the ‘DLL motif’ , which is actually a more extended and degenerate version 518 Trafﬁc 2002 ; 3 : 513 – 520 of the clathrin box centered around a well - conserved DLL or SLL , was found to be present in multiple copies in AP180 , as well as in all the large subunits of all the tetra - meric adaptor proteins ( 19 ) . Indeed , two sites that were predicted by this approach in the g subunit of AP1 were found to be bona ﬁde clathrin binding sites ( 58 ) . Another interesting variant is found in the yeast AP180 and epsin homologs . In these proteins , the ﬁnal acidic residue in the clathrin box is replaced by the acidic C - terminus of the protein . When the acidic C - terminus of the yeast epsin homolog Ent1p was displaced by the addition of 5 alanine residues , measurable clathrin binding was lost ( 59 ) . In the absence of data indicating that different subsets of clathrin box sequences interact with clathrin in a fundamen - tally different way , it seems reasonable to broaden the deﬁnition of a clathrin box to include all the well - character - ized clathrin binding sites . When these sequences are aligned ( Figure 3 ) , they can be best ﬁt by the consensus pL F p F p . Every site matches this consensus in at least 5 of the 6 positions . Positions 2 , 3 , and 4 show the least variation . The L at position two is nearly invariant . The aliphatic hydrophobic residues L / I / M are present 87 % of the time in position 3 , while the negatively charged resi - dues D / E are present 80 % of the time in position 4 . Posi - tion one shows the most variation , although it is a polar residue 90 % of the time , and positions 5 and 6 display moderate variation , with an L / I / M 67 % of the time in position 5 and a D / E 53 % of the time in position 6 . It remains to be determined whether all TD binding proteins will also interact between blades 1 and 2 , as was seen for the b 3a and b - arrestin 1 peptides ( 54 ) , or whether some of the sequence variation that has been observed actually reﬂects speciﬁcity for other grooves within the TD . Clathrin binding sites are often found within unstructured re - gions of proteins . The clathrin binding sites in the b and g subunits of the adaptors are within the unstructured hinge connecting the ear to the trunk ( 15 ) . The C - terminal clathrin assembly domains of AP180 and epsin are also both unstruc - tured ( 72 ) . In addition , many of these unstructured regions contain highly repetitive sequences ( Figure 4 ) , which in the case of mammalian AP180 have been shown to correlate with its clathrin assembly activity ( 19 ) . This may be important for how these proteins promote clathrin assembly . While a typical globular protein would be too small to cross - link the three TDs that are sitting under each vertex in an assembled coat ( Figure 2 ) , an extended polypeptide chain with multiple clathrin binding sites would be able to do so . Many of these proteins contain not only multiple clathrin binding sites , but also multiple binding sites for AP - 2 and Eps15 ( 55 ) . There are fewer constraints on the expansion of unstructured regions of proteins over the course of evolution . Indeed , the size and repetitive nature of the C - terminal domains of both epsin and AP180 are greater in the mammalian homologs than in the yeast homologs ( Figure 4 ) . It will be interesting to learn how these evolutionary changes have impacted the system func - tionally .
