Among these , dynamin - like proteins were shown to deform membranes into tubules , and thus far are the only proteins known to mechanically drive membrane ﬁ ssion . Because dynamin forms a helical coat circling a membrane tubule , its polymerization is thought to be responsible for this membrane deformation . Here we show that the force generated by dynamin polymerization , 18 pN , is suf - ﬁ cient to deform membranes yet can still be counteracted by high membrane tension . Importantly , we observe that at low dynamin concentration , polymer nucleation strongly depends on mem - brane curvature . This suggests that dynamin may be precisely recruited to membrane buds ’ necks because of their high curva - ture . To understand this curvature dependence , we developed a theory based on the competition between dynamin polymeriza - tion and membrane mechanical deformation . This curvature con - trol of dynamin polymerization is predicted for a speci ﬁ c range of concentrations ( ∼ 0 . 1 – 10 μ M ) , which corresponds to our measure - ments . More generally , we expect that any protein that binds or self - assembles onto membranes in a curvature - coupled way should behave in a qualitatively similar manner , but with its own speci ﬁ c range of concentration . force | nucleation | ﬁ ssion | endocytosis | dynamin - like proteins M embrane remodelingisanessential taskofproteins involved in membrane traf ﬁ c ( 1 , 2 ) . Dynamin is a large GTPase that has been shown to polymerize into a helical collar at the neck of endocytic buds ( 3 ) , where it subsequently plays a key role in the formationofendocyticvesiclesthrough ﬁ ssion ( 4 – 8 ) . Thisfunction is fundamental , as the knockout of the dynamin neuronal isoform leads to striking defects in synapse organization and results in a strong dysfunction of neuronal activity ( 9 ) . The recruitment of dynamin to endocytic buds is thought to depend on the local syn - thesis of phosphatidylinositol ( 4 , 5 ) bisphosphate ( PIP 2 ) , as dyna - min has a PIP 2 binding pleckstrin homology ( PH ) domain ( 10 ) . Dynamin is recruited late in clathrin - coated vesicle formation , as seen by total internal re ﬂ ection ﬂ uorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy ( 11 – 13 ) . Because PIP 2 is also responsible for the binding of clathrincoats , itis expectedtobepresentatthe clathrinbudfrom the beginning of its formation . Thus , another explanation was suggested : Proteins that interact with dynamin and possess a curvature - sensing Bin - Amphiphysin - Rvs ( BAR ) domain ( such as endophilin and amphiphysin ) were proposed to sense the high curvature of the neck and recruit dynamin ( 14 ) . Because the curvature of the neck is increasing during clathrin - coated vesicle formation to ﬁ nally reach the range needed for BAR recruit - ment , this could explain the arrival of dynamin at the very late stage of clathrin - coated vesicle formation . However , in solution , dynamin spontaneously associates into helices and rings ( 15 ) with an internal radius of ≈ 10 nm . Dynamin can also polymerize around preformed lipid nanorods of typically 10 - to 15 - nm radius containing PIP 2 ( 16 ) and around microtubules , onto which it was ﬁ rst puri ﬁ ed ( 17 ) . Binding of dynamin to liposomes has been shown to depend on liposome size ( 18 ) , and theoretical calcu - lations suggest that dynamin could be recruited by curvature - driven long - range interactions between membrane - bound dimers of dynamin ( 19 ) . Taken together , these observations may indicate that dynamin polymerizes preferentially along cylindrical struc - tures with a radius close to its spontaneous radius of curvature . Dynaminwasoneofthe ﬁ rstproteinsshowntotubulateprotein - free charged liposomes ( 8 ) . Because the ﬁ nal tubulesare circled by dynamin helices ( 8 , 20 ) , it is thought that dynamin polymerization provides the energy needed to deform the liposome membranes into a highly curved tubular structure . Another explanation is that hydrophobic loops present in the PH domain of dynamin ( 18 ) could generate spontaneous curvature like the BAR domain structure ( 21 ) , and that polymerization would just be required to stabilize the tubular shape . To discriminate between these hy - potheses , forces and energies involved in polymerization have to be measured . In this paper , we have measured the polymerization force of dynamin and con ﬁ rmed that it primarily deforms membranes through a scaffolding mechanism , forcing the membrane to adopt a tubular shape . We also show that the nucleation of the dynamin polymeriscontrolledby membrane curvatureatlow concentration . We ﬁ nd that at 440 nM dynamin in solution , spontaneous poly - merization of dynamin can be triggered on tubules with radii ranging between 10 and 30 nm , but not on larger tubules . This suggeststhattheincreasingcurvatureattheneckofclosingclathrin - coated pits could per se trigger the polymerization of dynamin . We also provide a mathematical description of this effect that predicts the assembly curvature dependence as a function of dynamin bulk concentration , and show that even if dynamin deforms membranes at high concentration , its polymerization can be controlled by membrane curvature at low concentration . Results To measure the force applied by dynamin polymerization onto preformed membrane tubes with an initially imposed radius r b , we built a microscopy setup ( 22 ) that combines a micropipette used for the manipulation of giant unilamellar vesicles ( GUVs ) and optical tweezers ( OT ) to extract a membrane tube and measure the force f b to hold it ( Fig . 1 ) .

In the absence of proteins , the radius r b and the force f b are simply set by σ and κ , the bending rigidity of the membrane ( 23 ) : r b ¼ ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ κ 2 σ r ; f b ¼ 2 π ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ 2 σκ p : [ 1 ] We thus control the radius through membrane tension and then measure the evolution of the tube force during dynamin poly - merization . This also allows us to study directly the binding / nucleation of dynamin on a tube of a given radius . GUVs were formed from egg phosphatidylcholine ( EPC ) supplemented with 10 % PIP 2 ( brain - puri ﬁ ed ; Avanti Polar Lipids ) and 1 % red ﬂ uo - rescent PIP 2 ( Echelon Biosciences ) . We selected EPC for its very low bending rigidity [ κ ≈ 12 k B T ( 24 ) , with k B indicating Boltz - mann ’ s constant and T indicating room temperature ] , which allowed us to obtain very narrow tubes ( Eq . 1 ) . Incorporation of the highly charged PIP 2 slightly increased the membrane bending rigidity ð κ ≈ 16 : 1 ± 3 k B T Þ ( Fig . S1 ) . We ﬁ rst studied the effect of high dynamin concentrations ( 12 μ M ) , exceeding the concentration required to spontaneously form tubes on low - tension membranes ( 6 ) ( a few μ M ) . After pulling a tube with the optical trap , a second pipette ﬁ lled with dynamin [ 10 – 25 % of which was Alexa - 488 - labeled ( 6 ) ] was carefully positioned near the tube ( see Materials and Methods ) . Dynamin rapidly entirely covered the tube ( Fig . 2 A and Movie S1 ) . This dynamin coating stabilized the tube , as the tube did not fully retract when the OT was switched off , in stark contrast to the rapid retraction of a bare tube ( Movie S2 ) . The bead was still connected to the vesicle through the covered tubule ( Fig . S2 ) , showing that despite the absence of an external force , the dynamin coating preserved the membrane tube within it . This may indicate that the dynamin had not simply adsorbed onto the tube but rather had polymerized around it . After dynamin injection on the tube , we also observed a steep ( 3 – 20 s ) drop in the tube force to a ﬁ nal value f d that was below f b ( Fig . 2 B ) . This provided us with a means of estimating the dynamin polymer - ization force : Assuming that dynamin is polymerized , we propose that , once the dynamin polymer fully covers the tube , it exerts a polymerization force P similar to a polymerizing microtubule against a membrane ( 25 , 26 ) . Experimentally , because the radii of dynamin - covered tubules have been reported to have a narrow dispersion ( 3 , 8 , 14 , 20 ) , we postulate that dynamin imposes a constant tube radius equal to r d , the internal radius of dynamin ( SI Mathematical Modeling and ref . 27 ) . The force of a mem - brane tube entirely covered by dynamin is given by ( SI Mathe - matical Modeling ) f d ¼ πκ = r d þ 2 π · r d · σ − P ; [ 2 ] where f d is the force of the dynamin - covered tube after the force drop . It re ﬂ ects the competition between the polymerization force P and the propensity of the tube to retract ( Eq . 1 ) . It thus includes contributions of membrane bending rigidity ( κ ) and tension ( σ ) . f d isexpected tobelinearwith membrane tension σ ( Eq . 2 ) . Thus , as high membrane tension results in high retraction force , it can counteract the polymerization force of dynamin ( f d > 0 ) . The linear dependence is observed experimentally ( Fig . 2 C ) , and a ﬁ t yields : ( i ) A new measurement of the inner radius of dynamin r d = 11 . 2 ± 0 . 3 nm , consistent with existing electron microscopy data ( 3 , 8 , 14 , 20 ) con ﬁ rming that dynamin imposes its radius on the membrane . ( ii ) A measurement of the polymerization force for a 12 μ M solution of dynamin : P = 18 . 1 ± 2 . 0 pN . The primary unit in assembled dynamin being a dimer ( 28 ) , this force is generated by the addition of one helical turn ( 14 dimers ) along its 13 - nm pitch . It corresponds to a free - energy gain ( polymerization energy ) of 3 . 8 k B T per dimer added , which is lower than the tubulin polymerization free energy ( 5 – 10 k B T ) ( 29 ) but higher than that of actin ( ∼ 0 . 5 – 1 . 5 k B T ) ( 30 ) .

To con ﬁ rm that dynamin was polymerized and not simply adsorbed , and to better observe the process of tube coverage , we reduced the dynamin concentration by 30 - fold . In the presence of dynamin at 440 nM in solution , small dynamin seeds appeared on the tube and their length steadily increased ( Fig . 2 D and Movie S3 ) at an average rate of 14 nm / s ( Fig . S3 ) . This nuclea - tion / growth process of dynamin structures con ﬁ rms a direct polymerization , because adsorption would yield a uniform dis - tribution on the tube . Further con ﬁ rmation came from ﬂ uo - rescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) experiments , as no recovery was observed after bleaching of the dynamin - coated tube ( Fig . S4 ) . However , although optically homogeneous , the polymer coat contains discontinuities , as also shown by FRAP ( Fig . S5 ) . Even if not detected by our imaging system , the rapid appearance of the seeds suggests that their nucleation is due to dynamin dimers already adsorbed on the membrane that rapidly cluster together on the tube . While these clusters grew , the tube force remained equal to f b ( Fig . 2 E , 2 – 4 ) , but when full coverage was reached , the force dropped to f d ( see Fig . 2 E , 5 – 6 ) . We note that , if adsorption of dynamin to the bare tube signi ﬁ cantly affected its spontaneous curvature or bending modulus , we would expect f ≠ f b before full coverage is reached . Hence , our observations con ﬁ rm that adsorption of dynamin to the bare tube has a negligible effect on the membrane , probably because sur - face concentration of nonpolymerized dynamin dimers is low , and that before full coating of the tube , the force is imposed by the noncoated sections of the tube . Rather , dynamin polymer - ization is needed to produce the force required to bend the membrane ( SI Mathematical Modeling ) . A second important observation is that , at a concentration of 440 nM , dynamin cannot polymerize on tubes that are too wide ( i . e . , large radii , 50 – 100 nm ; Fig . 2 D ) , and the nucleation of dynamin seeds requires the tube radius to be reduced through increasing the tension ( Eq . 1 ) . Only after a small enough radius was reached was polymerization suddenly triggered . Another striking fact is that dynamin was only seen on the tube and not on the GUV ( see Fig . 1 B ) . These observations suggest a strong dependence of dynamin polymerization on the curvature of the membrane . To characterize this dependence , we pulled tubes from GUVs held with low aspiration pressure . We then increased the membrane tension in discrete steps , thereby decreasing the tube radius . A typical experiment is shown in Fig . 3 A and B ( see also Fig . 2 D and E and Movie S3 ) , in which several stepwise increases of membrane tension were required before polymer - ization commenced . Once the radius was suf ﬁ ciently small , sev - eral clusters of dynamin appeared within a few seconds ( Fig . 3 A and B ) . For each experiment , tube radii were deduced from Eq . 1 to determine the bounds on the critical radius for dynamin poly - merization . For each vesicle , the upper bound was the smallest radius before polymerization started , whereas the lower bound was the radius at which polymerization was observed . Figure 3 C shows that the radius intervals for a population of 11 vesicles are spread between 10 and 35 nm , with an average value of 18 . 5 ± 6 nm . Therefore , we conclude that , at a concentration of 440 nM , dynamin is not able to polymerize on a membrane tube larger than approximately twice its internal diameter . As dynamin has been described in the past as a curvature - inducing protein at high concentration , we wondered how this curvature - dependent nucleation of dynamin evolved with con - centration . Strikingly , our observations suggest that the curvature - dependent nucleation of dynamin and its ability to deform mem - branes are not independent , as dynamin is still able to squeeze tubes under conditions where its nucleation is curvature - depend - ent ( Fig . S6 ) . To be able to squeeze the tube to 10 nm , dynamin polymerization onto the membrane should generate enough force to overcome the force needed to squeeze the tube more . Obvi - ously , the force needed to squeeze a tube is dependent on its initial radius , large tubes requiring more force to be squeezed to 10 nm than smaller ones . On the other hand , dynamin polymerization force P depends only on bulk concentration , because it is equiv - alent to a chemical potential . By comparing these two forces , we have theoretically determined the conditions for dynamin nucle - ation in terms of concentration and tube radius ( SI Mathematical Modeling and Fig . S7 ) . We de ﬁ ne conditions where nucleation occurs as values of concentration and radius for which dynamin polymerization force is higher than the force required to squeeze the tube . Here we always consider that dynamin is binding and polymerizing to a preformed tubule , and does not have to form the tubule . Ourmeasurementof P madeat12 μ Mallowsustoestimate P at any concentration ( SI Mathematical Modeling ) , assuming that the dynamin solution is overall very diluted ( much less than 1 M ) . We can then predict the existence of three regimes as a function of the concentration ( Fig . 4 ) : ( i ) For very low dynamin concentrations ( c < c 1 * = 280 nM or P < 0 ) , a tube should always remain uncoated , independent of its initial radius . Indeed , we have checked experimentally that at 50 nM , dynamin is unable to polymerize on the tubule , however small its radius ( Fig . 4 ) . ( ii ) Forintermediatedynaminconcentrations ( c 1 * = 280nM < c < c 2 * = 12 . 6 μ M or 0 < P < πκ / r d ) , we predict that dynamin can polymerize on tubes within a restricted range of radii : r − c ≤ r ≤ r þ c ( see Fig . 4 ) , enclosing dynamin radius value r d . Thus , if the tube is too thin ( r b < r − c ) or too thick ( r b > r þ c ) , dynamin should not be able to polymerize . As shown in Fig . 4 , r þ c increases rapidly forconcentrations above c 1 * .

PNAS | March 2 , 2010 | vol . 107 | no . 9 | 4143 C E LL B I O L O G Y P H Y S I C S sion of r þ c ( see legend of Fig . 4 ) , it is possible to calculate the critical radii for any dynamin concentration , and in particular predict that r c + ( 440 nM ) = 20 nm . This is consistent with the critical radius measured independently above ( Fig . 3 C ) . Also , we observe that for 2 . 5 μ M , dynamin spontaneously polymerizes onto tubules below 30 – 40 nm , suggesting that the critical radius is around 40 nm , consistent with the value predicted from the theory ( see purple line in Fig . 4 ) . ( iii ) For high dynamin concentrations ( c > c 2 * = 12 . 6 μ M or πκ / r d < P ) , we predict that dynamin should polymerize on all membrane tubes that have a radius of curvature larger than r d , including membrane tubes of zero curvature . Importantly , we describe here two regimes where dynamin behaves ﬁ rst as a curvature sensor ( its nucleation being dependent on membrane curvature ; see point ii ) , and a regime where dynamin behaves like a curvature generator ( formation of coated tubes is independent of their curvature ; see point iii ) . Discussion In the ﬁ rst set of experiments reported above at high dynamin concentration , we have shown that dynamin actually polymerizes on preformed tubes and have measured its polymerization force at this concentration ( 12 μ M ) . A ﬁ rst consequence of our experiments is that dynamin polymerization under these con - ditions generates enough force to deform membranes at low tension ( < 10 − 6 N / m ) . Moreover , our experiments show that for membrane tensions superior to 10 − 5 N / m , f d > 0 ( Fig . 2 C ) . This means that for tensions that are in the range of typical cellular membrane tensions ( ∼ 10 − 5 N / m ) ( 31 ) , dynamin should not be able to deform membranes into tubules , as its polymerization force can be overcome by high membrane tension . This supports the idea that recruitment of proteins to the membrane can be controlled by tuning cellular membrane tension , and could explain how endocytosis is up - regulated when plasma membrane tension is reduced ( 32 ) . Our second set of data shows that dynamin nucleation is strongly dependent on membrane curvature at low concen - trations . This may re ﬂ ect the ability of curved dynamin oligomers to preferentially polymerize on curved areas of the membrane . Moreover , the curvature - dependent nucleation of dynamin is highly concentration - dependent . More generally , any protein that interacts with membranes in a curvature - coupled manner should have the same type of concentration - dependent behavior . It can be understood in terms of the interplay between membrane cur - vature and chemical equilibrium between membrane - bound and - unbound forms of the protein . At low concentration the protein is mostly unbound , but preferentially binds onto curved parts of the membrane . At high bulk concentration , chemical equilibrium is displaced toward the bound form , in turn forcing the membrane to curve , as a protein - coated membrane is more stable when curved . In previous studies , the abilities of proteins to sense membrane curvature or to curve membranes have sometimes been regarded as separate functions . Our study suggests that these two functions should be effective for any protein interacting with membranes in a curvature - coupled manner . Importantly , for each protein , a speci ﬁ c range of concentrations ( given by its speci ﬁ c concentrations c 1 * and c 2 * ) should exist , separating conditions where the protein acts more as a curvature sensor or more as a curvature inducer . We predict that the speci ﬁ c physico - chemistry of membrane - protein interactions that have been described to explain curvature - sensing versus curvature - inducing functions ( 33 , 34 ) will have a strong in ﬂ uence on the ( c 1 * , c 2 * ) values . To discriminate the function of a protein in vivo , one must compare its physiological concentration with its speci ﬁ c critical concen - trations c 1 * and c 2 * . For dynamin , we found that the concen - tration range thought to be physiological ( 4 ) lies between c 1 * ( a few hundred nM ) and c 2 * ( a few tens μ M ) and , consequently , dynamin nucleation could be regulated by membrane curvature in vivo . Our ﬁ ndings suggest that dynamin could be recruited to the neck of closing clathrin - coated pits when their curvature is suf ﬁ - ciently high , and that its polymerization further constricts them to 10 nm . In vivo , dynamin appears at the clathrin - coated pits at the end of their formation ( 11 – 13 ) , when the neck has a radius of ∼ 20 nm ( 35 ) , close to the value of the critical radius ( 19 nm ) we found for dynamin at 440 nM .

Dynamin Puri ﬁ cation . Dynamin was puri ﬁ ed from rat brains using the GST - tagged SH3 domain of rat amphiphysin 1 as an af ﬁ nity ligand as previously described ( 6 , 16 ) . Brie ﬂ y , six brains were homogenized with a 60 - mL dounce in buffer A [ 20 mM Hepes ( pH 7 . 4 ) , 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM EGTA , 1 mM DTT , 1 % Triton X - 100 ] and centrifuged at 40 krpm in a Ti70 rotor ( Beckman ) , and the supernatant was incubated for 2 h with glutathione beads to which 3 – 5 mg of SH3 domain of amphiphysin was attached . Next , the beads were batch - washed several times . Elution was done with high salt [ 20 mM Hepes ( pH 7 . 4 ) , 1 . 2 M NaCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 ] . Unlabeled dynamin was dialyzed against storage buffer [ 20 mM Hepes ( pH 7 . 4 ) , 100 mM NaCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 ] , con - centrated using Amicon devices ( 50 kDa CO ) , aliquoted , ﬂ ash - frozen in liquid N 2 , and stored at − 80 °C . To ﬂ uorescently label dynamin , we dialyzed dynamin against PBS , 50 % glycerol . The labeling reaction was conducted using standard procedures ( Alexa - 488 protein - labeling kit from Invitrogen ) . Fluorescently labeled pro - tein was further dialyzed ( 2 – 3 h ) against storage buffer , concentrated , ali - quoted , ﬂ ash - frozen in liquid N 2 , and stored at − 80 °C . Experimental Setup . The setup was based on a commercial Nikon TE2000 inverted microscope modi ﬁ ed with the optional stage riser ( Nikon ) to create an extra port ( 22 ) . The confocal head was the eC1 confocal system ( Nikon ) with two laser lines ( λ = 488 nm ; λ = 543 nm ) . The micropipette technique has already been described ( 38 ) , and was used for setting GUV tension . Pipette manipulation was achieved with a home - made micromanipulator clamped on the microscope . In our experiments , a micropipette of about 3 - to 4 μ m diameter at the tip was connected to a mobile water reservoir , which allowed control of the membrane tension of the GUV from 5 . 10 − 6 to 2 . 10 − 4 N · m − 1 . To create a single , non - moving optical trap , light from an ytterbium ﬁ ber laser ( 1070nm , 5W , continuouswave ; IPGGmBH ) wasinjectedintoa100 × / 1 . 3 NAoilimmersionobjective ( Nikon ) usingaheat - re ﬂ ectingmirror ( λ c = 900nm ; Melles Griot ) . The x - y - z position of the trap was set with external optics in a con ﬁ gurationsimilartothatinref . 24 . Thepositionofthepolystyrenebeadin the trap was recorded and analyzed off - line using custom - made video - tracking software ( Konstantin Zeldovitch , Paris , France ) with a temporal res - olution of 40 ms and a subpixel spatial resolution of 35 nm . The trap stiffness was calibrated using the Stokes drag force method ( 39 ) . The stiffness of the tweezers was found to be 450 ± 30 pN · nm − 1 · W − 1 . Bright ﬁ eld imaging was done using a ﬂ uorescence illumination arm as an imaging port . To do so , the ﬂ uorescence ﬁ lter cube was replaced by a heat - re ﬂ ecting mirror ( λ c = 750 nm ; PGO GmBH Iserlohn ) and a convergent lens was added to the ﬂ uorescence excitation path to project the ﬁ eld dia - phragm plane on a video camera . The video signal was then digitized using Labview - based custom software . To avoid overlap between bright ﬁ eld and confocal data , only near - infrared light was used for bright ﬁ eld illumination . This was achieved by inserting a bandpass ﬁ lter ( 750 – 900 nm ; visible light absorbing RG9 Schott glass ) in front of the bright ﬁ eld illumination halogen lamp of the microscope . Sample Preparation . Three to four microliters of streptavidin - coated poly - styrene beads of 3 . 2 - μ m diameter diluted 20 times ( Spherotech ) were mixed with 200 μ L GTPase buffer and 2 – 5 μ L of GUVs taken directly from the growth chamber . In experiments with dynamin in bulk , unlabeled dynamin and ﬂ uorescent dynamin ( 10 – 20 % mol / mol ) were added to this solution to obtain the appropriate concentration . This solution was inserted into the sample chamber which was previously incubated with 4 mg / mL casein in GTPase buffer for 5 min . In experiments in which a second micropipette was used for local dynamin injection , a 10 - to 12 μ m - wide pipette was ﬁ lled with 3 – 5 μ L dynamin solution by capillary . Then , the dynamin solution was pushed toward the tip of the pipette by connecting it to an Eppendorf Femtojet microinjector and applying high pressure ( 100 – 300 mPa ) . Once the solution reached the tip , the pressure was reduced to its minimum ( 15 mPa ) and the pipette was inserted into the chamber . The pipette was kept at a continuous ﬂ ow , and the pipette was moved into the observation ﬁ eld to perform local injections of dynamin . ACKNOWLEDGMENTS . We thank J . Heuvingh , K .
