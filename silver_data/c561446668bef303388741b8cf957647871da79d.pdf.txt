Yet , while elegant work has elucidated molecular and mechanical cues affecting motion dynamics on a ﬂ at surface , it remains less clear how cells migrate in a 3D setting . In this review , we explore the changing parameters encountered by cells navigating through a 3D microenvironment compared to cells crawling on top of a 2D surface , and how these differences alter subcellular structures required for propulsion .

This essay is divided into two sections : a general introduction into the ﬁ eld , and a detailed analysis of how environmental factors affect a speci ﬁ c signaling circuit at the leading edge ( LE ) of mesenchymal cells . We begin the ﬁ rst section with a brief survey on the molecular mechanisms driving cell motion , and their emerging motion patterns in a planar system . Next , we review published work describing how changes in material properties impact force transmission and motion patterns . Following , we summarize which parameters differ when cells migrate on top of a 2D surface compared to cells embedded in a 3D environment , and how mechanical properties determine what mode of motion is employed by cells . The second section is focused on a self - organizing signaling circuit present at the LE of cells migrating in a mesenchymal mode . Considering the relevance of membrane geometry for the assembly of this signaling circuit , we begin the second part with an introduction on curvature - dependent protein activation , before exploring how mechanical properties may affect this signaling circuit and in consequence change the motion pattern employed by the cell . Along the whole review , we try to identify open questions and current limitations in the ﬁ eld .

Since then , many of the underlying mechanisms responsible for cell propulsion have been unveiled . We begin by summarizing the general properties of mesenchymal cell motion . Similarities and differences to other migration modes will be discussed later in the review . 2 . 1 Force transmission at the leading edge of migrating mesenchymal cells in 2D The prerequisite of any form of directed force transmission is an initial symmetry breaking step , which determines the future front and rear end of the cell ( Lauffenburger and Horwitz , 1996 ) . Symmetry breaking is fueled by various internal and external signaling cues ( Drubin and Nelson , 1996 ) . One of the main sensors for polarized chemotactic signaling cues are G protein - coupled receptors ( Rodríguez - Frade et al . , 1999 ) . At the molecular level , receptor activation converges into the polarization of commonly used secondary messengers . For instance , the LE displays increased phosphotyrosine kinase activity and elevated levels of PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 and DAG , while cytosolic Ca 2 + levels are lowered ( Tsai et al . , 2014 ) . This polarized distribution of secondary messengers is associated with a non - isotropic distribution of small Rho GTPase activity that either promotes actin polymerization ( e . g . , Rac , Cdc42 ) or actomyosin contractility ( e . g . , RhoA ) . Importantly , as small GTPases transition between an active and inactive state , such a polarized activity does not necessarily rely on a redistribution of the GTPase itself , but may also be coordinated through relocation of actuators ( i . e . , GTPase exchange factors , GEFs ) and inhibitors ( i . e . , Guanine nucleotide exchange factors , GEFs ) of the respective Rho GTPase . Analysis of Rho GTPase activation presents an intriguing spatio - temporal pattern , withhighlevelsofGTP - RacandGTP - Cdc42atprotrudingsites , while contractile regions show increased GTP - RhoA levels ( Kraynov et al . , 2000 ; Nalbant et al . , 2004 ; Pertz et al . , 2006 ; Machacek et al . , 2009 ) . Strikingly , as many receptor - based systems rely on secondary messengers that are mutually exclusive , initial symmetry breaking can also occur in the absence of external signaling inputs ( Kirschner et al . , 2000 ) . One example , how this may be achieved , is the so - called local excitation global inhibition ( LEGI ) model ( Xiong et al . , 2010 ) , an extension of the classical reaction - diffusion systems initially described by Alan Turing ( Turing , 1952 ) and later by Meinhardt and Gierer ( Gierer and Meinhardt , 1972 ) , where two mutually exclusive states take advantage of minor ﬂ uctuations to stochastically induce stable polarized structures . Cell polarization translates into directed cell motion . A result of polarized GTPase activity is a non - isotropic change in actin polymerization dynamics ( Peskin et al . , 1993 ) and actin branching ( Small et al . , 1995 ) , causing cell - wide rearrangements of the cytoskeleton ( Figure 1A ) . Of particular importance for cell motion are changes in actin dynamics at the LE . Considering that the LE has over the last decades been the subject of extensive research , we refer readers interested in this topic to reviews written elsewhere ( Pollard and Borisy , 2003 ; Krause and Gautreau , 2014 ) . Here , we only note that the polymerization rates of individual actin ﬁ laments at the LE can reach rates of up to 7 μ m / min ( Kiuchi et al . , 2011 ) , while the LE extends at a rate of only 1 – 2 μ m / min ( Begemann et al . , 2019 ) . The difference between the polymerization rate of actin and the net forward motion of the LE results in a retrograde actin ﬂ ow ( Lin et al . , 1997 ) . This continuous actin treadmilling , further augmented by inward directed actomyosin pulling ( Gardel et al . , 2008 ) , provides the basic force used for cell propulsion . Transfer of tractile forces from the cell to the substrate is accomplished by Integrin molecules ( Izzard and Lochner , 1976 ) . Integrins are transmembrane receptors , consisting of non - covalently interacting α and ß subunits . To date , over 20 unique combinations of α ( 18 types ) and ß ( 8 types ) subunits have been described that differ in selectivity to extracellular matrix ( ECM ) components ( Humphries et al . , 2006 ) . Common to all Integrins is the ability of participating in bidirectional signaling . Inside - out signaling describes the conformational change in the extracellular domain ( i . e . , activation ) upon binding of Talin to the cytoplasmatic tail of Integrin ( Tadokoro et al . , 2003 ) . In addition , Integrins also engage in outside - in signaling . Here , Integrins become activated upon force application from outside , which induces conformational changes in Integrin and increased ligand binding af ﬁ nity ( Friedland et al . , 2009 ) . In response to this external stimulation , Integrins trigger activation of FAK and other signaling pathways on its cytosolic site ( reviewed in Hamidi and Ivaska , 2018 ) . The two central elements for successful force - transduction through Integrins are on the extracellular site the binding of the heterodimer head to the ligand , and on the cytosolic site the unfolding of Talin ( del Rio et al . , 2009 ) . As individual Integrins display ligand selectivity [ e . g . , α M β 2 binds ICAM1 ( Rosetti et al . , 2015 ) ; α 3 β 1 binds VCAM1 ( Chen et al . , 2010 ) ] , the former element may give rise to selective cell - ECM interactions . The latter element refers to the fact that Talin only unfolds and binds to Vinculin and to actin in the presence of tensile forces . Hence , only under strain are mechanical forces transmitted from the cytoskeleton to the substrate , a mechanism called the ‘ molecular clutch ’ ( Mitchison and Kirschner , 1988 ) ( Figure 1B ) . Ultimately , the resulting force asymmetry along the planar cell axis yields forward propulsion , which is further augmented by de - adhesion of focal adhesions ( FAs ) and retraction at the rear of the cell ( Abercrombie , 1980 ) . Importantly , the LE in most cells is not a stable structure but repeatedly transitions through cycles consisting of extension , adhesion and contraction ( Lauffenburger and Horwitz , 1996 ; Ridley et al . , 2003 ; Stock and Pauli , 2021 ) . With each cycle , the cells crawl only a few micrometers forward . Hence , to ef ﬁ ciently migrate over a long distance in a persistent manner , the LE needs to be continuously reinitiated in the same direction . The need to Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology frontiersin . org 02 Pawluchin and Galic 10 . 3389 / fcell . 2022 . 1080995 repeatedly reinitiate the LE is not a design ﬂ aw , but a bene ﬁ cial feature , as periodic extinguishing of activity permits a system to adapt more readily to changing external directional stimuli ( Meinhardt and Gierer , 1974 ; Jilkine and Edelstein - Keshet , 2011 ) . As will be discussed in more detail later , pairing these extension - retraction cycles with differential Integrin activation , caused by environmental factors , can gives rise to distinct changes in LE dynamics . 2 . 2 From force transmission to motion pattern in 2D The literature presented to this point establishes a mechanism that allows cells to spontaneously polarize and migrate in an arbitrary direction , even in the absence of polarized signaling cues . To properly discuss the relevance of such cell motion , we ﬁ rst need to introduce the concept of self - organization . Following the physico - chemical de ﬁ nition , according to Ilya Prigogine ( Nicolis and Prigogine , 1977 ) , self - organization describes the ability of a system to create a spatial or temporal pattern at the macro - scale upon interactions of its components at the micro - scale . Importantly , to qualify for this de ﬁ nition , the emerging properties at the macro - scale need to be fundamentally different than the interactions that drive the pattern formation at the micro - scale , and the system needs to operate far off the thermodynamic equilibrium . Examples that meet these requirements are the animal swarm dynamics ( Tunstrøm et al . , 2013 ) , and certain patterns arising from reaction - diffusion systems ( Turing , 1952 ) . Self - assembling structures , such as crystals , lipid bilayers or polypeptides , which operate near or at the thermodynamic equilibrium , FIGURE 1 Cellmigrationin2D . ( A ) LEdynamicsin2D . Fromlefttoright , themolecularclutch , theleadingedgeofacellmigrating , andacross - sectionofa cell migrating on a ﬂ at , homogenous surface are shown .

Readers interested in learning more about the concept of self - organization , we refer to reviews written elsewhere ( Kondo and Miura , 2010 ; Saha and Galic , 2018 ; Mancinelli and Galic , 2020 ) . As summarized above , cells initiate symmetry breaking spontaneously or in response to a polarized input . In the terminology of self - organization , cells employ at the micro - scale cytoskeletal forces at the LE to migrate for a certain amount of time in one direction . At the macro - scale , this causes cells to transition between phases of random and directed motion ( Figure 1C ) . Strikingly , these emerging motion pattern strongly resembles the swimming pattern of E . coli , which also transitions stochastically between phases of random and ballistic propulsion ( Berg , 1975 ) . As proposed half a century ago , and revisited more recently theoretically , random transitions between phases of persistent and random motion present a search strategy to ﬁ nd sparsely distributed objects in a planar system ( Bénichou et al . , 2006 ; Harris et al . , 2012 ) . Notably , such a search strategy can also be found in foraging animals ( Viswanathan et al . , 1996 ) . Here , depending on the distance between individual targets and the detection sensitivity of the searching agent , the lifetime of the persistent phase is adjusted to maximize the search ef ﬁ ciency ( Bénichou et al . , 2006 ) . Hence , motion patterns arising at the micro - scale from stochastically formed LE can be interpreted at the macro - scale as a search strategy used by cells in pursuit of polarized signaling cues . Importantly , once a chemotactic signal is detected , cellular motion pattern become biased towards the source but maintain a random element ( Arrieumerlou and Meyer , 2005 ) , suggesting that stochastic search pattern act as a basic element that is ﬁ ne - tuned by polarized signaling inputs . 2 . 2 1 Substrate - dependence of 2D cell dynamics To this point , we assumed the substrate as uniform with no local or global inhomogeneities , which obviously is an oversimpli ﬁ cation , as the environment varies in its adhesiveness , degradability , elasticity , and geometrical properties . To determine how material properties affect cell dynamics at the micro - sale ( Table 1 , top left ) , we take a closer look at force transmission at the LE . As mentioned above , Integrin heads interact selectively with their ligands at the ECM . Importantly , this interaction displays catch - slip - bond dynamics , which means that the lifetime increases with higher tensile forces to an optimum , beyond which it again drops . For example , the maximum lifetime for α 5 β 1 Integrins occurs at 20 – 30 pN ( Kong et al . , 2009 ) . Since tensile forces of 5 pN are required to unfold Talin ( Yao et al . , 2016 ) , the adhesion strength between receptor and ligand is suf ﬁ ciently strong to trigger the molecular clutch on a rigid surface . On a soft surface , however , deformation of the substrate will preclude Talin unfolding and thus force transmission . Furthermore , assuming a constant pulling force , the absolute tensile force critically relies on the number of Integrin molecules involved in force transmission . Hence , the spatial distribution of ligands will also in ﬂ uence the threshold at which the molecular clutch is engaged . Finally , there are also indirect consequences to be considered . For instance , increased Integrin endocytosis has been observed in response to substrate elasticity , leading to increased rupture of Integrin - ligand complexes on soft substrates ( Du et al . , 2011 ) . Differences in material properties alter emerging motion pattern at the macro - scale ( Table 1 , top right ) . For instance , depending on the ability of engaging the molecular clutch , cells will move towards areas of higher adhesiveness ( haptotaxis ; Carter , 1965 ) . Haptotactic behavior may also be induced by changing the density of ligands . Considering that individual Integrins display some degree of selectivity ( see above ) , cells may also respond to spatial changes in ligand - composition of the ECM , even if the global ligand and receptor levels remain constant . In its most extreme case , such changes in ligand levels may lead to 2D cell con ﬁ nement . Notably , experimental systems that rely on such cell con ﬁ nement ( e . g . , micropatterning ) present an excellent platform to study systems - level decisions in single and collective cell motion ( Segerer et al . , 2015 ; Schreiber et al . , 2016 ; Brückner et al . , 2019 ) . Yet , motion patterns are not only regulated through changes in adhesion strength . A second material property that in ﬂ uences the direction towards which cells migrate is the substrate rigidity , a phenomenon called durotaxis ( Lo et al . , 2000 ) . Depending on the ef ﬁ ciency with which the molecular clutch is engaged , a consequence of ligand binding af ﬁ nity and Integrin density , cells were reported to display positive ( i . e . , migration towards higher stiffness ) and negative ( i . e . , migration towards lower stiffness ) durotaxis . Importantly , as rigidity is a passive parameter that cannot be directly measured ( Elosegui - Artola et al . , 2018 ) , cells need to probe the ECM to determine its mechanical properties . This is accomplished using both , lamellipodial as well as ﬁ lopodia protrusions ( Wong et al . , 2014 ) . Building on the same theme , cells were further shown to be sensitive to certain topologies ( topotaxis ; Park et al . , 2016 ) . Complementing these mechanisms that rely on variations of the molecular clutch , cells were also described to sense gradients in temperature ( thermotaxis ; Bahat et al . , 2003 ) . While the mechanism remains elusive , it is noteworthy that an increase in temperature yields augmented cell speed and persistence ( Maiuri et al . , 2015 ) . It is thus plausible that thermotaxis relies on a biased random walk , as observed for chemotaxis . 2 . 2 2 Substrate - dependence of 3D cell dynamics As we just elaborated , cells rapidly alter motion dynamics when presented with changing mechanical properties . The same is also true for cells embedded in a 3D environment . Prominent examples are the elevated speed mesenchymal cells display upon being squeezed under a glass slide ( Liu et al . , 2015 ) and the increased motility in the presence of a viscous extracellular medium ( Bera et al . , 2022 ) . To understand the underlying Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology frontiersin . org 04 Pawluchin and Galic 10 . 3389 / fcell . 2022 . 1080995 mechanisms , again the material properties of the surrounding substrate need to be considered . We begin with the similarities at the micro - scale ( Table 1 , bottom left ) . One variable that is likely to change is the substrate stiffness , which will drop from a GPa to KPa range when transitioning from rigid glass and plastic dishes to soft gels or tissues ( Baker and Chen , 2012 ) . As in a planar system , cells in a 3D environment were shown to move towards higher substrate stiffness ( DuChez et al . , 2019 ) , and display haptotactic behavior ( Moreno - Arotzena et al . , 2015 ) . As these parameters appear to be equally important , we will not further pursue them here . Readers interested in learning more on this topic , we refer to excellent reviews written elsewhere ( Friedl and Wolf , 2010 ; Charras and Sahai , 2014 ; SenGupta et al . , 2021 ; among others ) . While some parameters remain the same , others change , and a few new ones arise in cells navigating a complex 3 - dimensional space . One parameter that changes is the ability of cells to engage with its surroundings on all sides , with potential consequences considering possible asymmetries in global protein distribution . Once cells begin moving through a 3D environment , new parameters need to be faced . For instance , the pore sizes of the ECM through which the cells will squeeze ( Wolf et al . , 2013 ) suddenly become relevant . Critical here is the size of the nucleus , as it is the largest organelle of the cell and fragile to mechanical damage . Squeezing the nucleus while moving through a narrow opening not only activates cellular signaling cascades ( McGregor et al . , 2016 ) , but may in extreme cases yield nuclear rupture causing DNA damage and cell death ( Chen et al . , 2019 ) . To prevent this , laminin levels that determine the nuclear stiffness were shown to correlate with ECM stiffness ( Swift et al . , 2013 ) . Conversely , postmitotic and cancer cells that no longer need to protect the nucleus from damage display a soft nucleus ( Cross et al . , 2007 ) . Where the mesh size is too narrow for cells to move through , secretion of proteases will locally digest the ECM to create space for migration ( Gross and Lapiere , 1962 ) . Strikingly , cleavage of collagen through metalloproteases leads to exposure of RGD - containing domains . This , in turn , allows binding to Integrins ( Taubenberger et al . , 2010 ) and other ECM molecules ( Ortiz Franyuti et al . , 2018 ) . Hence , digestion of the environment may not only give space to crawl through , but also reveal adhesion sites needed to generate suf ﬁ cient traction . Finally , it is noteworthy mentioning that the ECM will also be modi ﬁ ed by cells traveling through it . For instance , pulling of cells via Integrins on ECM ﬁ bers leads to exposure of cryptic binding sites ( in ﬁ bronectin ) , which is necessary for its polymerization into ﬁ bers ( Lemmon et al . , 2009 ) . Furthermore , it was shown that aligned ECM ﬁ bers are secreted by cells migrating through a 3D environment ( Ingman et al . , 2006 ) . Intriguingly , since a ﬁ ber will more readily give in when pulled perpendicularly , any deviations from a completely isotropic ECM will yield a directional bias , causing ratchetaxis ( Caballero et al . , 2015 ) . Consequently , the ECM will be subject to modi ﬁ cations as cells travel through it , ultimately changing the trajectories of the cells that will follow , creating a possible memory effect . Since many mechanisms identi ﬁ ed in 2D were also observed in 3D , comparable motion patterns were reported for both systems ( Table 1 , bottom right ) . Unfortunately , no systematic analysis of 3D migration patterns exists to date . Considering that mechanical properties within a tissue are not homogenous ( i . e . , boundary conditions ) , and as the migrating cell population will inevitably come in contact with resident cell TABLE 1Modulating cell dynamics atthe micro - scaleandatthe macro - scale .

Yet even an ideal homogenous substrate will show varying pore sizes , obstacles , ﬁ ber lengths and stiffnesses , which argues that cell migration in 3D will by default display a larger variance in the motion pattern compared to a 2D system . 2 . 2 3 Modes of cell migration in 3D To this point , we were exploring changes in motion from the perspective of a mesenchymal cell . Yet , from a physiological perspective , it is desirable to vary modes of propulsion depending on cell function . For instance , it would be bene ﬁ cial for immune cells to display low selectivity to the substrate , as they frequently change their local environment on their pursuit of pathogens , while slow moving cells with a speci ﬁ c destination should be more selective . To account for these opposing needs , different types of motion have developed . The most frequent forms are mesenchymal and amoeboid . Mesenchymal cell migration ( Figure 2 , left ) , which is observed among others in neural crest cells ( Ebendal , 1977 ) and ﬁ broblasts ( Abercrombie , 1980 ) , locates the microtubule organizing center ( MTOC ) and most organelles in front of the nucleus ( Etienne - Manneville and Hall , 2001 ) , and relies as described above on force - transmission through Integrins to the ECM ( Doyle et al . , 2015 ) . In contrast , amoeboid cell motion ( Figure 2 , right ) , as seen in leukocytes ( Norberg et al . , 1977 ) and primordial germ cells ( Olguin - Olguin et al . , 2021 ) , frequently positions the MTOC and most organelles behind the nucleus ( Chiplonkar et al . , 1992 ) . Amoeboid migration further relies on short lived adhesions , rather than on mature FA complexes . When inhibiting integrin adhesion to their surroundings , dendritic cells were shown to still migrate in a 3D environment without any change in speed ( Lämmermann et al . , 2008 ) . However , such cells were impaired in their interaction with endothelial or epithelial surfaces , and displayed reduced resistance to blood ﬂ ow shear forces , highlighting the importance of Integrins for additional leukocyte - associated functions besides cell migration . When trapped between two planar surfaces , immune cells were further shown to move without FAs by exerting forces on their surroundings , a migration mode termed “ chimneying ” ( Pinner and Sahai , 2009 ) . Here , by applying forces on the surrounding surfaces , suf ﬁ cient friction is created for traction and locomotion of the cell . In contrast to the mesenchymal migration mode , traction force in this case was generated without the need to couple contraction within the cell to the substrate via adhesion complexes . These results point to the existence of subtypes within the amoeboid migration mode , depending on the extent of adhesive , contractile and protrusive forces ( Lämmermann and Sixt , 2009 ) . Amoeboid migrating cells make use of protrusive or contractile forces for cell locomotion with varying degrees of adhesiveness , leading to membrane protrusion governed by actin polymerization or by hydrostatic pressure caused by actomyosin contractility ( actin - free membrane blebs ) . Hence , the combination of the degree of adhesion , contraction and protrusion appears to determine the amoeboid migration mode and is cell type speci ﬁ c ( Lämmermann and Sixt , 2009 ) . Intriguingly , the environment does not only affect the mode of migration , but the mode of migration has also a reciprocal effect on the environment ( Table 1 ) . Mesenchymal cells are associated with long - lasting remodeling of the ECM . This is due to digestion , as well as due to pulling and rearrangement of the ECM . Amoeboid cells , in contrast , only leave a small imprint as proteolytic activity is minor , and no mechanical forces are exerted on the ECM . Notably , as the ECM is a viscoelastic material , a rapid migration mode may result in an elastic deformation that will close behind the cell , whereas slowly FIGURE 2 Different types of cell migration . To the left , schematic drawing of a cell using mesenchymal migration . Forces for propulsionaregeneratedbyconnectingactomyosin - basedforces ( blue ) through focal adhesions ( green ) to the substrate . Note that the MTOC ( blue ) is in front of the nucleus . To the right , amoeboid migration is depicted . Cells do not adhere to the substrate but rely on actomyosin - based compression of the cytosol at the back end of the cell for propulsion . Note that in immunecells , suchasdendriticcellsormacrophages , theMTOCis located behind the nucleus . Transitions from mesenchymal to ameboid migration ( orange wedge , mesenchymal - amoeboid transition MAT ) are promoted by low adhesion and Rho - ROCK driven Myosin - II activity ( Friedl and Wolf , 2010 ; Graziani et al . , 2022 ) . Conversely , transition from amoeboid to mesenchymal migration ( blue wedge , amoeboid - mesenchymal transition AMT ) are induced by cell - cell and cell - ECM adhesions , actin - rich protrusions at the leading edge driven by Rac and Cdc42 , ECM degradability and high Integrin - mediated adhesiveness ( Panková et al . , 2010 ; Graziani et al . , 2022 ) . Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology frontiersin . org 06 Pawluchin and Galic 10 . 3389 / fcell . 2022 . 1080995 moving mesenchymal cells may yield plastic deformations , which may leave a tunnel , even in the absence of enzymatic modi ﬁ cations . Importantly , mesenchymal and amoeboid modes should not be considered as mutually exclusive , but rather as two extremes on a continuum . Cells were reported to change between different modes depending on their environment . For instance , some cancer cells switch from mesenchymal to amoeboid upon protease inhibition ( Wolf et al . , 2003 ) , while others switch from amoeboid to mesenchymal upon increase in the relative HIC5 - to - paxillin ratio ( Gulvady et al . , 2018 ) . Similarly , the viscoelastic properties were reported to change motion dynamics ( Petrie et al . , 2012 ; Bera et al . , 2022 ) . These ﬁ ndings argue that cells can readily transition between migration modes in response of the level of con ﬁ nement and adhesion . Consistently , the underlying machinery used for propulsion remains the same . These considerations may also explain the presence ofhybridmodesofpropulsionsuchaslobopodialmotion ( Petrieetal . , 2012 ) . Here , similarly to amoeboid migration , cells use hydrostatic pressure to form a blunt spherical protrusion at the cell front , yet rely on pulling forces to the ECM for propulsion . Finally , it is noteworthy to mention the Reynolds number , and its effect on motion at the cellular level . The Reynolds number describes the ratio between the inertiaandviscosity ofa ﬂ uid . Objectsatthelengthscaleof cellshavea negligible inertia , leaving them to be subject of large viscous forces . Consequently , manycellhaveadaptedtotheenvironment , usingnon - symmetric motion types to ensure forward movement ( Purcell , 1977 ) . Considering this aspect , a more continuous transition between “ walking ” and “ swimming ” should be considered , yielding additional forms of propulsion that rely on ﬂ uid - like streams ( Stroka et al . , 2014 ) , or cytoskeletal waves ( Barry and Bretscher , 2010 ) . In this review , we only mention these additional modes of motion in passing . Again , we refer readers interested in this topic to excellent reviews written elsewhere ( Purcell , 1977 ; Lauga and Powers , 2009 ; Caballero et al . , 2020 ) . 3 Mechanochemical feedback loop in 2D and 3D — A case study As summarized above , several factors change when transitioning from migration on a planar surface to a three - dimensional environment . To explore how individual parameters may alter cell dynamics , we will take advantage of a curvature - dependent self - organizing circuit , which was previously described to control LE and motion pattern in single mesenchymal cells ( Begemann et al . , 2019 ) . To properly assess this topic , we ﬁ rst revisit some basic concepts from actin and membrane mechanics . 3 . 1 Curvature - dependent regulation of actin polymerization dynamics Cell migration in a planar system relies on mechanical forces exerted by the actomyosin network ( Gardel et al . , 2008 ) . Within the LE , individual actin ﬁ laments are facing the cell periphery with their barbed ends ( Urban et al . , 2010 ) , bringing this heavily regulated end of actin ﬁ laments in close proximity to the plasma membrane . This proximity to the site of action provides the system with an intriguing control unit . For one , it allows regulatory elements to be limited to the plasma membrane . More relevant for this review , however , it allows to couple actin dynamics directly to the shape of the membrane itself , thereby bypassing the need for receptor - based signaling cascades . Cell migration is associated with outward ( i . e . , negative ) and inward ( i . e . , positive ) deformations of the plasma membrane . Such highly curved membrane sections per se are energetically not favorable and will rapidly return to their lowest energy state , unless additional circuits are in place to maintain these membrane deformations . Intriguingly , studies identi ﬁ ed a protein family consisting of over 70 members that are capable of sensing inward ( i . e . , positive ) and outward ( i . e . , negative ) membrane curvature with the help of a BAR domain ( Peter et al . , 2004 ; Bhatia et al . , 2009 ; Galic et al . , 2012 ) . Within this protein family , 17 members carry actin - regulatory domains , allowing changes in actin polymerization dynamics in a curvature - dependent manner . Examples regulating actin dynamics at positively curved membrane sites include Arhgap17 and Arhgap44 that accomplish this through its RhoGAP domains ( Richnau and Aspenström , 2001 ; Galic et al . , 2014 ) . Complementing these proteins , several I - BAR domain proteins regulate actin polymerization at negatively curved membrane sections through binding of Rho GTPases to the CRIB domain ( Zhang et al . , 1997 ) , or of actin monomers to the WH2 domain ( Marchand et al . , 2001 ) . By coupling membrane curvature to actin polymerization dynamics , distinct emerging properties can be achieved . Prominent examples based on stochastic curvature - dependent feedback loops include the emergence of travelling waves ( Wu et al . , 2018 ) , or the formation of exploratory ﬁ lopodia in developing neurons ( Mancinelli et al . , 2021 ) . Intriguingly , recent work established that actin polymerization may depend on the membrane geometry itself . From theoretical ( Peskin et al . , 1993 ) and experimental ( Bieling et al . , 2016 ) work , we know that individual actin ﬁ laments can exert a forced of up to 6 pN . Since forming a protrusion requires more force ( Helfrich , 1973 ; Raucher and Sheetz , 1999 ) , a single ﬁ lament will only cause shallow membrane deformations . If , however , two ( or more ) such minor deformations occur in close proximity , membrane tension will cause bundling of individual actin ﬁ laments , which may cause the formation of protrusions with multiple actin ﬁ laments over time ( Liu et al . , 2008 ) . In addition , experimental and numerical analysis showed that the shape of the plasma membrane changes the local polymerization rates of branched actin ﬁ laments , thus causing the outgrowth of ﬁ nger - like protrusions ( Simon et al . , 2019 ) . While limited in number , these experimental and theoretical considerations show the ability of membrane shape to in ﬂ uence actin dynamics and in consequence cell shape and function . Notably , similar self - organization circuits were also described for microtubules ( Singh et al . , 2018 ; Gavriljuk et al . , 2021 ) .

Outgrowth of the LE yields outward ( i . e . , negative ) plasma membrane deformations with a curvature of 200 – 300 nm along the Z - axis ( Urban et al . , 2010 ) . This local negative curvature was reported to trigger assembly of a self - organizing circuit at the tip of the LE FIGURE 3 One curvature - dependent self - organizing circuit yields different emerging properties for mesenchymal cells plated in 2D and 3D .

Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology frontiersin . org 08 Pawluchin and Galic 10 . 3389 / fcell . 2022 . 1080995 ( Begemann et al . , 2019 ) , which leads to increased actin polymerization and therefore to LE extension ( Figure 3A ) . At the molecular level , this is accomplished through the recruitment of the curvature - sensitive I - BAR domain protein Baiap2 to negative membrane deformation sites . Baiap2 interacts through its CRIB and WH2 domain with actuators of actin polymerization dynamics . Hence , Baiap2 recruitment locally increases actin polymerization dynamics , leading to outgrowth of the LE . While this presents a mechanism for LE extension , it does not explain how the cell terminates this process . One factor , which likely limits the positive feedback loop , is a local increase in membrane tension at the LE ( Shi et al . , 2018 ) . Published work demonstrates that an increase in membrane tension reduces actin polymerization ( Raucher and Sheetz , 2000 ; Tsujita et al . , 2015 ; Diz - Muñoz et al . , 2016 ) . At the same time , increase in membrane tension may also induce mechanically activated ion channels ( Coste et al . , 2010 ) to mediate transition from extension to collapsing the LE . Strikingly , the collapse of a retracting LE will cause to the formation of a highly curved membrane site adjacent to adhesion complexes , triggering the enrichment of the signaling machinery and re - initiation of the next LE protrusion . With this mechanochemical feedback loop , the maintenance of the polarization is ensured and therefore the longevity of the LE increased . This curvature - dependent feedback loop is likely to interface with otherregulatorycircuits presentatthe LE . For instance , recent work showed that the retrograde ﬂ ow of actin ﬁ laments at the LE maintains cell polarity , whereby increased polymerization speed ( e . g . , at higher temperatures ) yields faster and more persistent migration ( Maiuri et al . , 2015 ) . As just mentioned , increased membrane curvature augments recruitment of I - BAR domain proteins , likely resulting in higher actin polymerization rates that will further increase membrane curvature . At the same time , elevated temperatures will reduce membrane rigidity ( Lamparter and Galic , 2020 ) , which will lead to an increase in membrane curvature in response to a constant force . It is thus plausible to envision that a curvature - dependent feedback loop may contribute to previously described correlation of actin dynamics and motion persistence of the cell . Yet , published work demonstrates that the retrograde ﬂ ow does not decrease but increases when Integrin binding is abolished due to actin slippage ( Renkawitz and Sixt , 2010 ) , arguing for the presence of additional ( compensatory ) circuits that work in parallel with the curvature - dependent signaling circuit at the LE . At the macro - scale , increasing the longevity of LE through repeated re - initiation and other parameters leads to augmented motion persistence ( Figure 3B ) . Augmented persistence , as discussed above , yields increased search ef ﬁ ciency , as it reduces oversampling of the very same position ( Begemann et al . , 2019 ) . 3 . 3 Curvature - dependent self - organization in 3D We next discuss how 3D material properties affect this particular self - organizing circuit at the micro - and macro - scale . The LE of mesenchymal cells in 3D resembles structurally the situation in 2D ( Thievessen et al . , 2015 ; Doyle et al . , 2021 ) . While it remains elusive whether contraction and coordination with subsequent LE extensions occurs in 3D , it is plausible to envision a similar mechanism ( Figure 3C ) . Consistently , the LE of mesenchymal cells grown in a 3D system relies on extension - retraction cycles for forward movement ( Doyle et al . , 2021 ) . However , LE outgrowth in 3D is not restricted to a plane , but stochastically distributed in all dimensions ( Thievessen et al . , 2015 ) , thus allowing cells to sample its entire environment for optimal migration conditions ( Doyle et al . , 2021 ) . Notably , contractile forces are independent of matrix properties ( Feld et al . , 2020 ) , and single FAs were shown to act as rigidity sensors ( Plotnikov et al . , 2012 ) . However , while the LE in 2D and 3D both grow out as planar sheets , reduced traction due to lower substrate stiffness is likely to delay and / or reduce membrane curvature at the tip of the LE . Changes in membrane curvature , in turn , may alter protein and isoform composition at the LE . Considering that individual curvature - sensitive proteins bind to distinct target proteins ( Safari and Suetsugu , 2012 ) , shape - dependent changes in protein stoichiometry may arise at the LE . Noteworthy , altered protrusion dynamics can be observed in some cell types when transitioning from a stiff 2D to a soft 3D environment ( Santos et al . , 2020 ) . In the absence of mature FAs , for instance at sites where the ECM surrounding the cell is not suitable to build up suf ﬁ cient tension , no mesenchymal migration is possible ( Thievessen et al . , 2015 ; Doyle et al . , 2021 ) . Here , Integrin - independent mechanisms , as shown for a number of cell types ( Paluch et al . , 2006 ; Lämmermann et al . , 2008 ) , promote cell locomotion . Strikingly , recent work showed that force - induced membrane deformations can lead to Talin - independent activation of integrins ( Kim et al . , 2020 ) , raising the possibility that Integrins activate upon LE outgrowth to test the strength of the bond by actomyosin contractions . If true , this would leave only the connections that have the optimal conditions for further migration in this direction . For a full understanding of this process , the activation status of Integrins could be imaged during 3D cell migration with focus on the protrusion - adhesion - contraction cycle at the LE . At the macro - scale , the self - organizing circuit is likely to in ﬂ uence motion pattern as described for the planar system ( Begemann et al . , 2019 ) . In support of such a notion , published work showed that 3D mesenchymal migration depends on the relative LE adhesiveness ( Caballero et al . , 2015 ) , whereby FAs will dictate the direction ( Lo Vecchio Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology frontiersin . org 09 Pawluchin and Galic 10 . 3389 / fcell . 2022 . 1080995 et al . , 2020 ) and the speed ( Kim and Wirtz , 2013 ) of motion . Consistently , ablating collagen ﬁ bers 20 µm in front of the LE , which precludes among others re - initiation of the self - organizing circuit , was shown to avoid further migration in this direction ( Doyle et al . , 2021 ) . How exactly FAs ( size , number , maturity , stability , and density ) and ECM ( composition , density , rigidity , orientation ) properties alter LE dynamics and in consequence cell migration , remains elusive . As that the self - organizing circuit is well suited to detect gradients in adhesion strength ( haptotaxis ) , ECM stiffness ( durotaxis ) , and ﬁ ber orientation ( ratchetaxis ) , it raises the possibility that it may not only contribute to persistent cell migration but also bias stochastic 3D motion pattern in a particular direction ( Figure 3C ) . Finally , changing mechanical properties of a 3D system may not only in ﬂ uence motion pattern , but could also yield additional emerging features of the self - organizing circuit . As mentioned above , a cell pulling on the substrate will deform the adjacent matrix ( Doyle et al . , 2021 ) . For two neighboring cells that adhere to the same ﬁ ber , this means that one cell will sense the other cell tugging the ﬁ ber ( Figure 3D ) . As pulling the ﬁ ber away from a cell will form an outward membrane deformation , this may trigger activation of the self - organizing circuit and LE extension in that direction . Hence , it is plausible to envision that pulling on the same ﬁ ber may yield self - organization of cells into equidistant cell aggregates , which has been observed in vitro ( Trappmann et al . , 2017 ) and in vivo ( Biggs et al . , 2018 ; Trela et al . , 2021 ) . To determine this putative emerging property , the activation status of Integrins in neighboring cells could be imaged , and corresponding motion pattern determined . 4 Concluding remarks In this review we surveyed the changing mechanical properties encountered by cells when transitioning from a 2D to a 3D environment and discussed its functional consequences . While incomplete , the presented data demonstrates that the ECM - cell interactions are by no means linear . For instance , increasing the concentration of an ECM component in a hydrogel will not only change the material properties ( i . e . , rigidity , mesh size ) , but also the liganddensity , andmayalsoinducereceptorendocytosis . Furthermore , reducing the mesh size beyond a certain threshold may lead to increased protease secretion , which would not only soften the ECM but also expose new ligands for Integrin - binding . Considering this intricate interdependence of material and cellular parameters , the ECM - cell system should be considered a N - dimensional space with numerous distinct constellations that cells populate ( and transition in - between ) to ef ﬁ ciently navigate the 3D space . How to untangle such an interdependent system ? Considering its importance at the microscale , a promising ﬁ rst step towards a comprehensive understanding of 3D cell migration is a better grasp on Integrin - ligand dynamics . Towards this goal , microscopic studies and biophysical measurements of biomimetic hydrogels will be essential to clearly separate individual parameters in ﬂ uencing 3D cell migration , and to determine the hierarchy of these factors . Such quantitative measurements will further be crucial for developing future numerical models that recapitulate an idealized 3D environment – a critical prerequisite towards exploring optimal search strategies in three dimensions . Such a quantitative approach , however , hinges on the development of suitable 3D microscopy techniques , as well as an extensive description of the matrix properties . Only such a systematic analysis will provide us with a holistic view of motion patterns in 3D , and may on the long turn open up new inroads to study cell dynamics under physiological ( e . g . , immune system ; Tabdanov et al . , 2021 ) and pathological ( e . g . , cancer metastasis ; Eddy et al . , 2021 ) conditions .
