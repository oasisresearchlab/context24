One of the 11 main challenges is the ﬁ ne control of the mechanical properties 12 of these materials . The bulk properties of hydrogels not only 13 depend on the intrinsic properties of the ﬁ bers but also on the 14 network topology formed . In this work we show how ﬁ ber − 15 ﬁ ber interactions can be manipulated by design to control the 16 ﬁ nal hydrogel network topology and therefore control the ﬁ nal 17 properties of the material . This was achieved by exploiting the 18 design features of β - sheet forming peptides based on hydrophobic and hydrophilic residue alternation and exploiting the ability 19 of the arginine ’ s guanidine side group to interact with itself and with other amino acid side groups . By designing octa - peptides 20 based on phenylalanine , glutamic acid , lysine , and arginine , we have investigated how ﬁ ber association and bundling a ﬀ ect the 21 dynamic shear modulus of hydrogels and how it can be controlled by design . This work opens the possibility to ﬁ ne - tune by 22 design the bulk properties of peptide hydrogels . 23 ■ INTRODUCTION 24 The use of noncovalent self - assembly to construct materials has 25 become a prominent strategy in material science o ﬀ ering 26 practical routes for the construction of increasingly functional 27 materials for a variety of applications ranging from electronics 28 to biotechnology . 1 − 4 A variety of molecular building blocks can 29 be used for this purpose ; one such block that has attracted 30 considerable attention in the last 20 years is de novo designed 31 self - assembling peptides . 5 − 8 One particular class of materials 32 with signi ﬁ cant potential in the biological and biomedical ﬁ elds 33 are self - assembling peptide based hydrogels . These highly 34 hydrated , biodegradable and biocompatible “ soft ” materials are 35 very attractive for the design of sca ﬀ olds for the 3D culture of 36 cells 9 − 11 and delivery of drugs . 12 , 13 A number of self - assembling 37 peptide designs have emerged in the literature that allow the 38 fabrication of very stable hydrogels . One of the main challenges 39 that remain in the ﬁ eld is the ﬁ ne - tuning of the mechanical 40 properties of these hydrogels as di ﬀ erent cell types , and 41 therapeutic approaches require hydrogels with di ﬀ erent proper - 42 ties . 43 The formation of hydrogels by self - assembling peptides 44 involves two distinct processes ; the self - assembly of the 45 peptides themselves to form thin ﬁ brillar structures and the 46 entanglement and association of these ﬁ brils into a three - f1 47 dimensional percolated network ( Figure 1 ) . Developing a 48 fundamental understanding of these two processes at all length 49 scales is crucial as the properties of the ﬁ nal materials will not 50 only depend on the intrinsic properties of the ﬁ bers , but also on 51 how they assemble and ultimately on the properties of the 52 network formed . Most of the focus in the literature is on the 53 ﬁ rst process , the self - assembly of the peptides into ﬁ bers . The 54 second process has been less studied and is less well 55 understood and is the focus of this work . 56 We have investigated in recent years the self - assembly of a 57 family of amphipathic short β - sheet forming peptides inspired 58 from Zhang ’ s group work . 14 − 20 These peptides are typically 8 − 59 16 residues long and their design is based on the alternation of 60 hydrophobic and hydrophilic amino acids . These peptides are 61 well - known to readily self - assemble into antiparallel β - sheets 62 and form , above a critical gelation concentration ( CGC ) , 63 hydrogels that have been shown to support the growth of a 64 variety of cells , 21 − 27 as well as allow the controlled delivery of a 65 variety of drugs . 12 , 28 − 31 One interesting aspect of this design is 66 that formation of these sheets results in all the hydrophobic 67 side groups being located on the same face of the sheet , while 68 all the hydrophilic side groups are located on the opposite 69 face . 32 − 35 As a result it is speculated that two of these sheets 70 associate through their hydrophobic faces to form a ﬁ ber . 71 Above the CGC these ﬁ bers entangle and / or associate to form 72 a 3D percolated network that traps water , that is , a hydrogel 73 ( Figure 1 ) . As a consequence inter ﬁ ber interactions which play Received : November 15 , 2016 Revised : January 6 , 2017 Published : January 9 , 2017 Article pubs . acs . org / Biomac © XXXX American Chemical Society A DOI : 10 . 1021 / acs . biomac . 6b01693 Biomacromolecules XXXX , XXX , XXX − XXX lhc00 | ACSJCA | JCA10 . 0 . 1465 / W Unicode | research . 3f ( R3 . 6 . i12 HF01 : 4457 | 2 . 0 alpha 39 ) 2016 / 10 / 28 09 : 46 : 00 | PROD - JCA1 | rq _ 6938253 | 1 / 17 / 2017 14 : 27 : 45 | 9 | JCA - DEFAULT 74 a key role in the ﬁ brillar network formation are mainly 75 controlled by the hydrophilic residues . 76 In this work we were interested in understanding how 77 network topology a ﬀ ects the mechanical properties of the 78 hydrogel and how it can be used to design materials with 79 tailored properties . For this purpose we decided to use a family 80 of octapeptides based on the same design that are known to 81 self - assemble into β - sheet rich ﬁ brils . This approach allowed us 82 to keep the ﬁ ber structure identical across all the systems and 83 focus on the e ﬀ ect of network topology on the mechanical 84 properties of the hydrogels formed . As mentioned above due to 85 the design chosen inter ﬁ ber interactions are controlled mainly 86 by the hydrophilic residues . Of particular interest to us was 87 arginine , which is a residue that has a guanidine side group . 88 This side group can interact strongly with other amino acid side 89 groups as well as with itself in a variety of con ﬁ gurations , 90 including through hydrogen bonding and electrostatic inter - 91 actions , as well as salt bridges . 36 − 38 Our hypothesis was that the 92 introduction of this amino acid would result in increased ﬁ ber − 93 ﬁ ber interactions and therefore would a ﬀ ect the topology of the 94 network formed and the ﬁ nal mechanical properties of the 95 hydrogels . For this purpose a family of phenylalanine based 96 peptides containing lysine ( K ) and arginine ( R ) were designed . 97 Hydrogels were prepared and characterized using a range of 98 techniques including Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy 99 ( FTIR ) , small angle neutron scattering ( SANS ) , transmission 100 electron microscopy ( TEM ) , and oscillatory shear rheology . 101 ■ MATERIALS AND METHODS 102 Materials . Peptides were purchased as TFA salts from Cambridge 103 Research Biochemicals ( U . K . ; FEFEFKFK and FEFKFEFK ) and 104 Biomatik ( U . S . A . ; FEFEFRFK and FEFEFRFR ) and used without 105 further puri ﬁ cation . The purity of the compounds was veri ﬁ ed by 106 HPLC ( > 95 % ; see Supporting Information ( SI ) for HPLC traces ) and 107 mass spectrometry . HPLC grade and deuterated ( 99 . 9 atom % D ) 108 water were purchased from Sigma - Aldrich ( U . K . ) . 109 Sample Preparation . Depending on the desired formulation and 110 concentration the required amount of peptide ( s ) powders ( or powder 111 mixtures ) was suspended in HPLC grade water . The samples were 112 vortexed and sonicated ( VWR ultrasonicator bath , 30 W ) until the 113 peptide ( s ) was fully dissolved . Due to presence of TFA ( typically 3 : 1 114 TFA to peptide ratio as the TFA is bound to the two cationic residues 115 as well as the terminal NH 3 + end group ) , the pH of the sample was 116 2 . 3 − 2 . 8 . In order to have a common pH for all the samples , their pH 117 was adjusted to 3 . 0 using a 1 M solution of NaOH ( typically ∼ 10 − 20 118 μ L added , depending on starting pH ) . The samples were then stored 119 at room temperature overnight , and the pH was checked again before 120 use . 121 Phase Diagram . The samples were prepared in a test tube as 122 described above and placed in a water bath , the temperature of which 123 was controlled by both mercury and Grant analogue thermometers . 124 The temperature of the bath was increased from 25 to 90 ° C by steps 125 of 5 ° C . The samples were left to equilibrate at each temperature for 126 15 min before their macroscopic state was assessed through the “ test - 127 tube tilting ” method . 128 Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy ( FTIR ) . Multiple 129 bounce attenuated total re ﬂ ectance ( ATR ) FTIR experiments were 130 undertaken using samples prepared in water . Spectra were recorded on 131 a Thermo Nicolet 5700 spectrometer equipped with a trough plate 132 comprising of a zinc selenide crystal , which permitted 12 re ﬂ ections 133 with a 45 ° angle of incidence . The samples were spread directly on the 134 surface of the trough plate . Spectra were acquired in the 4000 − 400 135 cm − 1 range with a resolution of 4 cm − 1 over 256 scans . The water 136 spectrum was used as background and subtracted from all spectra 137 using Omnic software ( version 7 . 2 , Thermo Electron Corporation ) 138 provided with the instrument . 139 Dynamic Oscillatory Shear Rheometry . Viscoelastic properties 140 were assessed in an oscillatory mode , using a stress - controlled 141 rheometer ( TA Instruments AR - G2 ) equipped with a Peltier plate 142 to control temperature . A parallel plate geometry was used with a 143 diameter of 20 mm and a gap of 250 μ m . To ensure the measurements 144 were made in the linear regime , amplitude sweeps were performed and 145 showed no variation in G ′ and G ″ up to a strain of 1 % . The dynamic 146 shear moduli of the hydrogel were measured at 1 Hz with a strain of 147 0 . 1 % . All experiments were performed at 25 ° C at least three times to 148 ensure reproducibility . 149 Transmission Electron Microscopy ( TEM ) . Samples were 150 prepared at 10 mg mL − 1 and diluted 10 - fold . The solutions were 151 vortexed until they were fully homogeneous . A total of 20 μ L of 152 sample was adsorbed onto the glow - discharged , carbon - coated copper Figure 1 .

The loaded grids were 154 washed in distilled water for 15 s and negatively stained with 20 μ L of 155 1 % ( w / v ) uranyl acetate . The grids were then blotted on Whatman 50 156 ﬁ lter paper and allowed to air - dry for 30 min prior to observation . Data 157 was collected at high vacuum on a FEI Tecnai12 BioTwin transmission 158 electron microscope connected to a high resolution Orius CCD 159 SC1000 camera . 160 Small Angle Neutron Scattering ( SANS ) . SANS experiments 161 were performed at the Forshungszentrum Ju ̈ lich ( FRJ - 2 ) on 162 di ﬀ ractometer KWS - 2 . The white beam was monochromated with a 163 velocity selector by Dornier . The neutron wavelength was λ = 0 . 48 nm 164 with a wavelength distribution characterized by a full width at half - 165 maximum Δ λ / λ = 0 . 1 . Samples were irradiated on an area of 0 . 8 × 0 . 8 166 cm 2 . The beamline was equipped with a two - dimensional detector with 167 a 50 × 50 cm 2 active area with a spatial resolution of 0 . 8 × 0 . 8 cm 2 168 ( further details are available on request at Forshungszentrum Ju ̈ lich ) . 169 By varying the sample − detector distance , the available momentum 170 transfer vector ( q ) was in the range of 0 . 1 < q ( nm − 1 ) < 2 . 4 , with q = 171 ( 4 π / λ ) sin ( θ / 2 ) , where θ is the scattering angle . The collected data 172 was corrected for the detector e ﬃ ciency and dark current background . 173 Counter normalization was achieved by using the incoherent scattering 174 of an amorphous hydrogenous poly ( methyl methacrylate ) secondary 175 standard . After ensuring the scattering was isotropic , the data were 176 radially averaged to obtain a one - dimensional scattering curve . Under 177 these conditions , the normalized intensity scattered by a sample is δ δ = − ⎡ ⎣⎢ ⎤ ⎦⎥ I q I q T I q T ( ) ( ) ( ) N s s s e e e 178 ( 1 ) 179 where I N ( q ) , δ , and T are the normalized measured intensity , the 180 thickness , and the transmission of the sample ( s ) and the empty cell 181 ( e ) , respectively . To extract the coherent intensity scattered by the 182 peptides , we subtracted the coherent intensity scattered by the solvent 183 and the incoherent intensity scattered by the peptide and the solvent 184 from the total scattered intensity . The coherent intensity scattered by 185 the peptides in absolute units is then = − − − I q K I q C I q I ( ) 1 [ ( ) ( 1 ) ( ) ] A N p D b 186 ( 2 ) 187 where I D ( q ) is the normalized intensity scattered by the deuterated 188 solvent , C P is the peptide concentration in g cm − 3 , I b is the background 189 scattering mainly due to the incoherent scattering of the hydrogenous 190 peptides , and K is the contrast factor . The background scattering , I b , 191 was estimated using the Porod law , which gives the scattered intensity 192 of a two - phase system at high q values : 39 − 41 = + I q K q I ( ) p 4 b 193 ( 3 ) 194 where K p is the Porod constant . I b was estimated by ﬁ tting the last 10 195 data points ( 2 . 5 − 3 . 0 nm − 1 ) of the scattering curves , where the 196 background scattering is dominant , using a Porod representation 197 ( q 4 I ( q ) vs q 4 ) . Solutions and hydrogel samples for neutron 198 experiments were prepared as described above using deuterated 199 water directly in HELLMA quartz cells with an optical path length of 2 200 and 5 mm , depending on the sample concentration . Deuterated water 201 ( D 2 O ) was used instead of hydrogenated water to increase the 202 contrast between the peptides and the solvent . 203 ■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 204 In an earlier study we investigated the self - assembly of a series 205 of octa - peptides that included FEF E F K FK and FEF K F E FK ( F : 206 phenylalanine ; K : lysine ; E : glutamic acid ) . These two peptides 207 di ﬀ er only by the position of the central E and K residues 208 ( Figure 1 ) . In this earlier study , FTIR was used to show that 209 both peptides had the same tendency to form β - sheet ﬁ bers . In 210 addition , SANS experiments carried out at low concentration , Figure 2 .

Biomacromolecules Article DOI : 10 . 1021 / acs . biomac . 6b01693 Biomacromolecules XXXX , XXX , XXX − XXX C 211 that is , below the critical gelation concentration ( CGC ) , 212 revealed that similar ﬁ bers were formed by both peptides . 17 213 One puzzling result obtained since that study has been the 214 di ﬀ erence in mechanical properties of the hydrogels formed . f2 215 Indeed , as can be seen from Figure 2A higher shear moduli , in 216 particular , at higher peptide concentrations were obtained for 217 FEF K F E FK . In addition , the temperature − concentration phase 218 diagrams of these two systems were also found to di ﬀ er 219 signi ﬁ cantly ( Figure 2B ) . FEF K F E FK formed hydrogels at 220 lower concentration ( > 5 mg mL − 1 ) that could not be melted , 221 while FEF E F K FK formed hydrogels at higher concentration 222 ( > 10 mg mL − 1 ) that could be melted into viscous liquids at 223 high temperature . Based on our earlier work , our hypothesis 224 was that the di ﬀ erences in mechanical properties and phase 225 behavior were due to di ﬀ erences in network topologies rather 226 than di ﬀ erences in ﬁ ber intrinsic properties . TEM supported 227 this assumption . As can be seen from Figure 2C , TEM images 228 show the formation of a network of uniform thin entangled 229 ﬁ bers for FEF E F K FK with dimensions , 3 − 5 nm , which agrees 230 with our earlier work . “ Y ” shaped branching points can be 231 observed where one ﬁ ber “ splits ” into two ﬁ bers of the same 232 dimensions . The branching of β - sheet forming peptides was 233 discussed by Pochan and co - worker for a family of β - hairpin 234 peptides . These authors suggested that branching was due to 235 the mis - assembly of the peptides . 42 Keeping in mind that each 236 ﬁ ber is formed by two β - sheets ( Figure 1 ) , it is reasonable to 237 assume a similar origin for the “ Y ” shaped branching observed 238 here . For FEF K F E FK , a slightly di ﬀ erent network topology is 239 observed . Although “ Y ” shaped branching of ﬁ bers can still be 240 observed , thicker ﬁ ber bundles , formed from the association 241 along their length of two or more ﬁ bers , can also be seen 242 ( Figure 2D ) . This suggests that the positions of K and E a ﬀ ects 243 the tendency of the ﬁ bers to interact . It should be noted that at 244 pH 3 these peptides and , therefore , the ﬁ bers they form carry a 245 positive charge and that the presence of TFA in the sample will 246 result in some level of charge screening that will promote 247 peptide self - assembly and sample gelation . The position of the 248 lysine residues a ﬀ ects the overall charge distribution on the 249 ﬁ ber surface and therefore the way the electrostatic repulsion 250 acts . 43 , 44 The di ﬀ erent topologies observed for these two 251 networks agree well with the observations above . Indeed , the 252 association of ﬁ bers along their length is expected to result in 253 sti ﬀ er ﬁ ber bundles and a sti ﬀ er network , resulting in a higher 254 shear modulus . Fiber bundling is expected to increase with 255 concentration , as ﬁ bers come into closer proximity ; therefore , 256 the e ﬀ ect on the mechanical properties is also expected , as 257 observed , to be more marked at higher concentrations . In 258 addition , this association tendency is thought to also promote 259 the formation of a more stable percolated network resulting in a 260 lower CGC and a reduced melting tendency . Indeed , ﬁ ber 261 bundles are expected to be more di ﬃ cult to melt / disassociate 262 than “ Y ” branching points as the latter can be considered weak 263 points . 264 It is well - known that hydrogel mechanical properties are very 265 sensitive to network topology . A number of theoretical models 266 can be found that describe the mechanical properties of 267 hydrogels . 45 They usually relate the modulus of the hydrogel to 268 the concentration through power laws . One such model was 269 proposed by Jones and Marques for a network of semirigid 270 ﬁ bers joined at frozen junction points . 46 It relates the shear 271 modulus of the hydrogel to the sample concentration through ′ ∼ + − G C ( 3 FD ) / ( 3 FD ) 272 ( 4 ) 273 where FD is the fractal dimension of interconnecting objects . 274 For semirigid ﬁ bers , FD is expected to be in the range of 1 . 0 − 275 1 . 2 corresponding to an exponent of 2 . 0 − 2 . 3 . The following 276 power laws were obtained for our two peptides : ⇒ ′ ∼ ⇒ ′ ∼ G C G C E K K E FEF F FK and FEF F FK 2 . 4 4 . 6 277 A good agreement was obtained for the FEF E F K FK system 278 with Jones and Marques model . The network topology 279 observed for this system ( uniform semirigid ﬁ bers connected 280 at frozen junction points ) resembles the most the network 281 topology assumed in this model . For FEF K F E FK , a larger 282 exponent than predicted was obtained . There are a number of 283 reasons for the deviation from the model . First of all , the model Figure 3 .

In addition , as the model 287 was developed for polymeric systems , the concentration is 288 assumed to directly relate to the concentration of connecting 289 elements in the network . As shown by Ramzi et al . , the 290 presence in a polymeric network of pendant chains that do not 291 participate in the network elasticity can result in a higher than 292 expected exponent , as the “ e ﬀ ective ” network element 293 concentration is lower than the polymer concentration . 47 In 294 our case , there is no direct evidence of the presence of pendant 295 chains . Nevertheless , the ﬁ ber thickening observed for 296 FEF K F E FK system is thought to have a similar e ﬀ ect . Indeed , 297 ﬁ ber bundles will act as a single element contributing to the 298 network elasticity , resulting in a lower apparent network 299 “ e ﬀ ective ” concentration and , therefore , in a higher exponent . 300 The results discussed above suggest that ﬁ ber association can 301 be used to control network topology and , therefore , the 302 mechanical properties of the peptide hydrogels . To con ﬁ rm 303 that such an approach can be used to design hydrogels with 304 tailored properties , arginine residues were introduced in our 305 peptide design by replacing one or both of the lysines . As 306 mentioned in the introduction , arginine is expected to promote 307 through its guanidine side group strong ﬁ ber − ﬁ ber interactions . 308 The following two sequences were designed : FEFEF R FK f3 309 and FEFEF R F R ( Figure 3A ) . For FEFEF R F R , opaque viscous 310 solutions / precipitates were obtained at all concentrations . 311 FTIR con ﬁ rmed the adoption by this peptide of a β - sheet 312 conformation ( Figure 3B ) , and TEM revealed the presence of 313 similar ﬁ bers as above ( Figure 3C ) . The ﬁ bers though were 314 observed to form , in this case , large bundles / aggregates , clearly 315 showing that , as hypothesized , R promotes strong ﬁ ber − ﬁ ber 316 interactions . To prevent the formation of such large scale 317 aggregates and their precipitation , we decided to “ dope ” 318 FEF E F K FK hydrogels with small amounts of FEFEF R F R , 10 319 and 20 % ( wt ) , keeping the overall sample peptide concen - 320 tration constant . These two samples will be referred to as 321 FK90 : FR10 and FK80 : FR20 , respectively . 322 FK90 : FR10 and FK80 : FR20 were found to form slightly 323 “ hazy ” hydrogels , while FEFEF R FK was found to form clear 324 transparent hydrogels in the concentration range investigated . 325 f4 As can be seen from Figure 4A , FTIR results suggest that the 326 introduction of arginine did not a ﬀ ect the peptides tendency to 327 form β - sheets ; indeed , similar relative peak intensities in the 328 amide region were observed for all samples . The formation of 329 ﬁ brous networks was con ﬁ rmed by TEM ( Figure 4B ) . 330 A ﬁ rst series of SANS experiments was performed below the 331 CGC of the samples in the dilute regime . In this regime , the 332 scattering observed is dominated by the form factor of the 333 diluted scattering entities . As can be seen from Figure 4C , all 334 the samples scattering patterns present a ∼ q − 1 behavior at low 335 q typical of the scattering of ﬁ bers . For in ﬁ nitely long rod - like 336 structures , that is , semirigid ﬁ bers , in the q range investigated , 337 the scattered intensity can be written as 39 , 48 , 49 π μ = + σ q I q qC f qR Cst ( ) ( ) 2 A p L 338 ( 5 ) 339 where μ L is the mass per unit length of the rod in g mol − 1 nm − 1 , 340 C p is the peptide concentration in g cm − 3 , and f ( qR σ ) represents 341 the cross - section scattering , R σ being the cross - section radius of 342 gyration of the rod . Cst is a constant term taking into account 343 interscattering e ﬀ ects . For qR σ < 1 , eq 5 reduces to 39 , 48 − 50 π μ = σ ⎛ ⎝⎜ ⎞ ⎠⎟ qI q C q R ( ) exp 2 A p L 2 2 344 ( 6 ) 345 If the scattering observed is of the form described by eq 6 , then 346 at low q , a linear behavior should be obtained in a ln [ qI A ( q ) ] 347 versus q 2 representation . This is indeed the case as can be seen 348 from Figure 4D . The cross - section radius of gyration , R σ , of the Figure 4 .

If 350 we assume that the ﬁ bers can be modeled by a plain in ﬁ nitely 351 long cylinder then R σ is related to the diameter of the ﬁ ber , d , 352 through = σ R d / 8 2 . As can be seen from Figure 4 , for 353 FEF E F K FK , a R σ of 1 . 1 ± 0 . 2 nm was obtained corresponding 354 to a ﬁ ber diameter of 3 . 1 ± 0 . 6 nm , in good agreement with our 355 previous work and the TEM image in Figure 2 . For 356 FEFEF R FK , a slightly higher R σ is obtained corresponding to 357 a slightly larger ﬁ ber diameter of 4 . 0 ± 0 . 5 nm . For FK90 : FR10 358 and FK80 : FR20 , larger R σ are obtained corresponding to ﬁ ber 359 diameters of 5 . 6 ± 0 . 6 and 7 . 1 ± 0 . 8 nm , respectively . From the 360 FTIR and TEM results above , we can assume that the same 361 basic β - sheet ﬁ bers are formed for all the systems , and 362 therefore , the increase in ﬁ ber sizes below the CGC suggests 363 the formation of ﬁ ber bundles through lateral ﬁ ber association . 364 Indeed , it should be kept in mind that the scattering observed is 365 the average scattering of all the rod - like objects , in this case , 366 ﬁ bers and ﬁ ber bundles , present in the sample . Although the 367 FEFEF R FK sample contains a larger nominal amount of 368 arginine residues ( 12 . 5 % of all residues are R in this sample 369 compared to 5 % for FK80 : FR20 and 2 . 5 % for FK90 : FR10 ) , this 370 system shows a “ lower ” drive to ﬁ ber association / bundling . 371 These results suggest that the localization of two R on the same 372 peptide promotes strong ﬁ ber association and bundle 373 formation . 374 In order to investigate the samples morphology , a second 375 series of SANS experiments were carried out above the CGC , at 376 20 and 30 mg mL − 1 . In this regime , the scattering observed is 377 due to the overall sample morphology , that is , ﬁ bers and f5 378 network . The results presented in Figure 5A , B con ﬁ rm that the 379 introduction of R a ﬀ ects the morphology of the sample . 380 For FEF E F K FK , a scattering peak is observed at 0 . 3 and 0 . 4 381 nm − 1 for the 20 and 30 mg mL − 1 samples , respectively . The 382 presence of such a peak suggests that the samples ’ morphology 383 is highly homogeneous and that a characteristic density 384 ﬂ uctuation length is present across the sample . This density 385 ﬂ uctuation length is related to the characteristic length scale of 386 the morphology which in turn is related to the characteristic 387 length scales of the two phases forming it : the low density 388 phase ( water rich phase , i . e . , mesh size ) , and the high density 389 phase ( ﬁ ber rich phase : i . e . , ﬁ ber cross - section ) . 50 As a result , if 390 it is assumed that the ﬁ ber cross - section is signi ﬁ cantly smaller 391 than the network mesh size , the position of the scattering peak 392 can be related through Bragg ’ s law , ( 2 π ) / q to the network mesh 393 size ∼ 20 and 15 nm for the 20 and 30 mg mL − 1 samples , 394 respectively . As expected , the mesh size decreases with 395 increasing peptide concentration as the density of ﬁ bers 396 increases . It should be kept in mind that , as discussed above , 397 for FEF E F K FK , no ﬁ ber association / aggregation is expected . In 398 addition , at pH 3 , this peptide and therefore the ﬁ bers carry a 399 positive charge resulting in ﬁ ber − ﬁ ber repulsion . We 400 hypothesize that as a result there is the formation of highly 401 homogeneous ﬁ bers that “ avoid ” contact due to electrostatic 402 repulsion , a highly homogeneous network and morphology is 403 obtained with branching points and entanglements ( no ﬁ ber 404 association / bundling ) . 405 When FEFEF R F R is introduced ( FK90 : FR10 and 406 FK80 : FR20 samples ) , the peak scattering intensity decreases , 407 while the scattering intensity at low q increases . These changes 408 in scattering pro ﬁ les suggest that the sample morphology 409 becomes less homogeneous and that larger scattering entities 410 form , respectively . As mentioned above , the scattering observed 411 in this regime originates from the overall sample morphology , 412 ﬁ bers and network ; therefore , the increase of the scattering 413 intensity at low q is thought to be related to the formation of 414 ﬁ ber bundles as well as to the resulting increase in network 415 mesh size ( Figure 5C ) . It is interesting to note that the changes 416 in scattering patterns are more pronounced at higher 417 concentration . The drive of ﬁ ber association is indeed expected 418 to increase with increasing concentration as the ﬁ bers are in 419 closer proximity . These results seem to be supported by the 420 TEM images ( Figure 4B ) showing a more coarse network 421 topology for FK20 : FR80 sample , although it should be kept in Figure 5 . ( A , B ) SANS scattering pattern ( I A ( q ) vs q ) obtained for samples prepared at 20 mg mL − 1 ( A ) and 30 mg mL − 1 ( B ) , above the CGC of the samples .

For this sample , too , scattering 428 at low q is observed to increase signi ﬁ cantly again pointing 429 toward the formation of larger scattering entities and a decrease 430 in morphology homogeneity . The loss of morphological 431 homogeneity , while ﬁ ber bundles form , is not surprising . 432 Indeed , ﬁ ber lateral association as occurring here is not a 433 controlled process , and therefore , ﬁ ber bundles of di ﬀ erent 434 sizes are expected to form . This is expected to lead to a 435 polydispersed mesh size and di ﬀ use scattering ( Figure 5 ) . 436 Interestingly , the transparent appearance of the hydrogel 437 formed with FEFEF R FK suggests that any morphological 438 heterogeneity formed is below the half - micron size above where 439 light scattering is observed . On the other hand , FK90 : FR10 and 440 FK80 : FR20 form slightly hazy hydrogels , suggesting in this case 441 morphological heterogeneities reach the half - micron scale . 442 These observations suggest that the introduction of only one R 443 on all the peptides leads to more “ controlled ” ﬁ ber association / 444 aggregation , resulting in ﬁ ber bundles of limited size . On the 445 other hand , introduction of FEFEFRFR leads to uncontrolled 446 ﬁ ber association / aggregation , resulting in the formation of large 447 bundles and , as discussed above , for pure FEFEF R F R sample to 448 their precipitation . 449 As expected , the change in network topology has a strong f6 450 e ﬀ ect on the mechanical properties of the hydrogels . In Figure f6 451 6 , the dynamic storage shear moduli obtained for the 3 samples 452 at 20 and 30 mg mL − 1 are presented . The introduction of 453 FEFEF R F R results in a gradual increase in the G ′ of the 454 sample . Surprisingly , FEFEF R FK forms stronger hydrogel at 455 both concentrations , although as discussed above , the ﬁ ber 456 association drive seems to be “ weaker ” for this sample . This 457 clearly points out that in order to control the properties of the 458 hydrogel the ﬁ ber association process needs to occur in a 459 controlled fashion . Indeed , the bulk properties of the hydrogels 460 will be a combination between the intrinsic properties of the 461 ﬁ bers / ﬁ ber bundles and the overall properties of the network , 462 which will depend on the mesh size and therefore on the level 463 of ﬁ ber bundling . These results though clearly point out the 464 importance of network topology in controlling the properties of 465 this type of hydrogel . 466 ■ CONCLUSIONS 467 We have investigated how network topology a ﬀ ects the 468 mechanical properties of a family of β - sheet forming peptides 469 whose design is based on the alternation of hydrophobic and 470 hydrophilic residues . Our results clearly show that , in addition 471 to the ﬁ ber intrinsic properties , the way these ﬁ bers self - 472 assemble themselves to form a 3D percolated network has a 473 signi ﬁ cant impact on the ﬁ nal macroscopic properties of the 474 resulting hydrogels . Taking advantage of the peptide design 475 features used here , we have shown how , by design , in this 476 speci ﬁ c case , introducing a highly interacting hydrophilic amino 477 acid arginine , the ﬁ ber − ﬁ ber interaction can be manipulated to 478 control the level of ﬁ ber lateral association / bundling . This 479 approach allows carefully engineering by design not only the 480 type of ﬁ ber formed , in our case , antiparallel β - sheet , but also 481 the type of network topology formed , branched versus 482 associated . The approach described in this work will be key 483 for the design of hydrogels , exploiting β - sheet forming peptides 484 with highly controlled mechanical properties , in particular , for 485 the biomedical ﬁ eld . 486 ■ ASSOCIATED CONTENT 487 * S Supporting Information 488 The Supporting Information is available free of charge on the 489 ACS Publications website at DOI : 10 . 1021 / acs . bio - 490 mac . 6b01693 . 491 HPLC traces of the four peptides used in this work 492 ( PDF ) . 493 ■ AUTHOR INFORMATION 494 Corresponding Author 495 * E - mail : a . saiani @ manchester . ac . uk .
