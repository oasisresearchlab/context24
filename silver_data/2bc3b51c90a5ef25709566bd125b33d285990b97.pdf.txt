Both proteins have phosphatidyli - nositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) - binding do - mains in their N termini , but these domains are struc - turally and functionally different . To understand the basis of their distinct properties , we measured the PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - dependent membrane binding of the epsin N - terminal homology ( ENTH ) domain and the AP180 N - terminal homology ( ANTH ) domain by means of surface plasmon resonance and monolayer penetration tech - niques and also calculated the effect of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 on the electrostatic potential of these domains . PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 enhances the electrostatic membrane as - sociation of both domains ; however , PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 bind - ing exerts distinct effects on their membrane dissocia - tion . Specifically , PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 induces the membrane penetration of the N - terminal (cid:1) - helix of the ENTH do - main , which slows the membrane dissociation of the domain and triggers the membrane deformation . These results provide the biophysical explanation for the membrane bending activity of epsin and its ENTH domain . Clathrin - mediated endocytosis is an energetically demand - ing process that is necessary for a diverse number of cellular processes , such as nutrient uptake , removal of receptors from the cell surface , and synaptic vesicle recycling ( 1 – 3 ) . This proc - ess involves cooperation of clathrin , the AP - 2 adaptor complex and a number of other accessory proteins , including epsin . The process of endocytosis occurs through four general steps includ - ing bud initiation , bud formation , bud constriction , and vesicle scission ( 2 , 3 ) . Initiation of the bud site is thought to occur by the membrane association of AP180 and epsin as well as the adaptor complex AP - 2 . These proteins recruit clathrin to the membrane . The bud then forms and constricts , while the ac - tivities of amphiphysin and endophilin remodel the membrane at the bud neck . Finally , the GTPase activity of dynamin is required for the release of the vesicle into the cytoplasm ( 4 ) . Recently , the importance of phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphos - phate ( PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) 1 in clathrin - mediated endocytosis has come to light ( 5 ) . In particular , epsin and AP180 , which are necessary for the formation of clathrin - coated vesicles , bind PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 through their conserved N - terminal domains ( 6 – 8 ) . The epsin N - terminal homology ( ENTH ) domain ( 9 – 13 ) is a highly conserved domain of (cid:1) 140 amino acids that has been identified in all epsins and binds PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 with high af - finity and specificity ( 6 – 8 ) . The ENTH domain is made of a superhelix of 7 (cid:1) - helices with an eighth (cid:1) - helix misaligned with the superhelical axis , which is structurally similar to the su - perhelical VHS domain ( 14 ) . The AP180 / CALM and HIP1 / HIP1R protein families contain an N - terminal domain that is homologous to the ENTH domain and binds PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( 13 ) . X - ray structural analysis of the AP180 N - terminal homology ( ANTH ) domains of AP180 / CALM ( 7 ) showed that the ANTH domain is extended by one or more (cid:1) - helices when compared with the ENTH domain . Both the AP180 ANTH domain and the epsin ENTH domain bind PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 with high specificity , but structurally in a different manner . The ANTH domain binds PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 via solvent - exposed Lys and His side chains on one side of the domain , and only the lipid headgroup is contacted by the pro - tein ( 7 ) . The ENTH domain binds PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in a pocket and makes extensive contacts with both the headgroup and glycerol backbone ( 8 ) . On binding the PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 headgroup , resi - dues 3 – 15 of the ENTH domain adopt an (cid:1) - helical structure which makes up one side of the PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - binding pocket and provides ionic interactions . The outer surface of this am - phipathic helix , termed helix 0 , was proposed to lie in the plane of the lipid bilayer with the Leu 6 , Met 10 , and Ile 13 residues buried into the hydrophobic phase . This insertion of helix 0 was proposed to displace the lipid headgroups thus driving mem - brane curvature ( 8 ) . A number of mutations of the hydrophobic * This work was supported by National Institutes of Health Grants GM66147 ( to D . M . ) and GM52598 and GM53987 ( to W . C . ) .

This paper is available on line at http : / / www . jbc . org 28993 residues were used to advance this hypothesis ; however , bio - physical evidence for membrane insertion of the epsin ENTH domain has not been shown . In this study , we investigated the effect of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 on the membrane binding of the epsin ENTH and the AP180 ANTH domains by surface plasmon resonance ( SPR ) and mono - layer analyses . Results from these measurements as well as the calculation of their electrostatic potential in the absence and presence of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 indicate that the ENTH and ANTH domains have distinctly different modes of membrane interaction . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Materials— 1 - Palmitoyl - 2 - oleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine ( POPC ) , 1 - palmitoyl - 2 - oleoyl - sn - glycero - phosphoethanolamine ( POPE ) , and 1 - palmitoyl - 2 - oleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphoserine ( POPS ) were from Avanti Polar Lipids ( Alabaster , AL ) . 1 , 2 - Dipalmitoyl derivatives of phosphatidylinositol 3 , 5 - bisphosphate , phosphatidylinositol 3 , 4 , 5 - triphosphate , and PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 were a kind gift from Dr . Karol Bruzik . Phospholipid concentrations were determined by phosphate analysis ( 15 ) . Restriction endonucleases and other enzymes for molecular biol - ogy were from New England Biolabs ( Beverly , MA ) . CHAPS and octyl glucoside were from Sigma and Fisher Scientific , respectively . The liposofast microextruder and 100 - nm polycarbonate filters were from Avestin ( Ottawa , Ontario ) . Pioneer L1 sensor chip was from Biacore AB ( Piscataway , NJ ) . Mutagenesis and Protein Expression— The R114A mutant of epsin ENTH was prepared by the overlap extension polymerase chain reac - tion method ( 16 ) , and all other mutants were prepared as described previously ( 8 ) . Each construct was subcloned into the pGEX - 4T - 1 vector containing a N - terminal glutathione S - transferase fusion and trans - formed into Escherichia coli DH5 (cid:1) cells for plasmid isolation . After verifying the DNA sequence , the plasmid was transformed into E . coli BL21 cells for protein expression . One liter of 2 (cid:2) YT medium ( 16 g of tryptone , 10 g of yeast extract , and 5 g of NaCl in 1 liter of H 2 O ) containing 100 (cid:2) g / ml ampicillin was inoculated with BL21 cells har - boring each construct and grown at 37 °C until absorbance at 600 nm reached 0 . 4 . At this time , 20 mg of isopropyl - 1 - thio - (cid:3) - D - galactopyrano - side was added , and cells were then incubated at 25 °C for 16 h . Cells were harvested for 10 min at 4 , 000 (cid:2) g , and the resulting pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of 20 m M Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 , containing 0 . 16 M NaCl , 50 (cid:2) M phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride , and 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 . The solution was then sonicated for 8 min using a 30 - s sonication followed by 30 - s cooling on ice . This was followed by centrifugation at 48 , 000 (cid:2) g to separate the soluble and insoluble fractions . The supernatant was filtered into a 50 - ml tube , and 1 ml of GST (cid:1) Tag TM resin ( Novagen , Madison , WI ) was added . The mixture was incubated on ice with gentle stirring ( 80 rpm ) for 30 min . After this time , the mixture was poured onto a column , which was washed with 20 ml of 20 m M Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 , containing 0 . 16 M NaCl . The column was then sealed and 1 ml of 20 m M Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 , containing 0 . 16 M NaCl and 0 . 25 m M CaCl 2 along with 2 units of thrombin were added to cleave the glutathione S - transferase tag . After 6 h at 25 °C , the protein was eluted from the column in 5 fractions using 1 ml of 20 m M Tris , pH 8 . 0 , containing 0 . 16 M NaCl . Purity was checked on an 18 % polyacrylamide gel , and samples were pooled and concentrated to 1 ml . Protein concentration was then deter - mined using the BCA method ( Pierce ) . The AP180 ANTH domain was purified as described previously ( 8 ) . Monolayer Penetration Experiments— The penetration of ENTH and ANTH domains into the phospholipid monolayer was measured at 23 °C by monitoring the change in surface pressure ( (cid:4) ) at constant surface area using a circular Teflon trough ( 4 - cm diameter and 1 - cm depth ) and Wilhelmy plate connected to a Cahn microbalance as described previ - ously ( 17 ) . A lipid monolayer containing various combinations of phos - pholipids was spread onto the subphase composed of 10 m M HEPES , pH 7 . 4 , containing 0 . 16 M NaCl until the desired initial surface pressure ( (cid:4) 0 ) was reached . After the signal stabilized ( (cid:1) 5 min ) , 50 (cid:2) g of proteins were injected to the subphase through the hole in the wall of the trough , and the change in surface pressure ( (cid:3) (cid:4) ) was monitored for 45 min while stirring the subphase at 60 rpm . Typically , the (cid:3) (cid:4) value reached a maximum after 20 min . It has been shown empirically that (cid:3) (cid:4) caused by protein is mainly due to the penetration of the protein into the lipid monolayer . For example , in the case of the C2 domain of group IVA cytosolic phospholipase A 2 , excellent agreement was found between large (cid:3) (cid:4) caused by several residues in the calcium - binding loops ( 17 ) and their actual membrane penetration measured by fluorescence ( 18 ) and electron spin resonance studies ( 19 , 20 ) . The maximal (cid:3) (cid:4) value depended on the protein concentration and reached a saturation value ( e . g . [ epsin ENTH ] (cid:5) 3 . 0 (cid:2) g / ml ) ; therefore , protein concentration in the subphase was maintained above such values to ensure that the ob - served (cid:3) (cid:4) represented a maximum value . The resulting (cid:3) (cid:4) was plotted versus (cid:4) 0 from which the critical surface pressure ( (cid:4) c ) was determined as the x intercept ( 21 , 22 ) . Kinetic and Equilibrium SPR Experiments— All SPR binding meas - urements were performed at 23 °C . The coating of the L1 sensor chip has been described in detail previously ( 23 , 24 ) . The sensor chip surface was washed and then coated by injecting 90 (cid:2) l of vesicles containing various phospholipids ( see ‘‘Results’’ ) at 5 (cid:2) l / min to give a response of 6 , 000 resonance units . Similarly , a control surface was coated with vesicles , typically without phosphoinositide of interest , to give the same resonance unit response as the active binding surface . Under our ex - perimental conditions , no binding was detected to this control surface beyond the refractive index change for the ENTH and ANTH domains . Each lipid layer was stabilized by injecting 10 (cid:2) l of 50 m M NaOH three times at 100 (cid:2) l / min . Typically , no decrease in lipid signal was seen after the first injection . Kinetic SPR measurements were done at the flow rate of 30 (cid:2) l / min . 30 (cid:2) l of protein in 10 m M HEPES , pH 7 . 4 , containing 0 . 16 M KCl was injected to give an association time of 60 s , while the dissociation was monitored for 400 s at which time the protein had completely dissociated . The lipid surface was washed with 10 (cid:2) l of 50 m M NaOH before the next protein injection . After sensorgrams were obtained for five different concentrations of each protein within a 10 - fold range of K d , each of the sensorgrams was corrected for refractive index change by subtracting the control surface response from it . The association and dissociation phases of all sensor - grams were globally fit to a 1 : 1 Langmuir binding model : protein (cid:4) ( protein - binding site on the vesicle ) 7 ( complex ) using BIAevalutation 3 . 0 software ( Biacore ) as described previously ( 24 – 26 ) . The dissociation constant ( K d ) was then calculated from the equation , K d (cid:5) k d / k a . Mass transport ( 27 , 28 ) was not a limiting factor in our experiments , as change in flow rate ( 5 (cid:2) l / min to 60 (cid:2) l / min ) did not affect kinetics of association and dissociation . After curve fitting , residual plots and (cid:6) 2 values were checked to verify the validity of the binding model . Each data set was repeated three times to calculate a standard deviation . Also , K d values were separately determined from equilibrium SPR measurements . For these measurements , the flow rate was reduced to 2 (cid:2) l / min to allow sufficient time for the association phase , which in turn allows resonance unit values to reach saturating response values ( R eq ) . R eq values were then plotted versus protein concentrations ( C ) , and the K d value was determined by a non - linear least squares analysis of the binding isotherm using an equation , R eq (cid:5) R max / ( 1 (cid:4) K d / C ) , where R max is a maximal R eq value . K d values obtained by both kinetic and equi - librium analysis for epsin ENTH and AP180 ANTH were in agreement ( data not shown ) , thus validating the kinetic analysis . It should be noted that in our SPR analysis K d is defined in terms of not the molarity of phospholipids but the molarity of protein - binding sites on the vesicle . Thus , if each protein - binding site on the vesicle is composed of n lipids , nK d is the dissociation constant in terms of molarity of lipid monomer ( 22 ) . Due to difficulty involved in accurate determination of the concentration of lipids coated on the sensor chip , only K d was determined in our SPR analysis and the relative affinity was calculated as a ratio of K d values assuming that n values are similar for wild type and mutants . This assumption is based on our finding that R max values , which are proportional to [ total lipid ] / n ( 22 ) , were similar ( within 10 % ) for all proteins under our experimental conditions in which the sensor chip was coated with the same amount of lipids . Electrostatic Potential Computation— The electrostatic potentials of ENTH and ANTH domains with and without inositol 1 , 4 , 5 - triphosphate ( Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ) were calculated with a modified version of the program DelPhi and visualized in the program GRASP ( 29 ) , as described previ - ously ( 30 ) . In the panels of Fig . 3 , the electrostatic potentials are represented by two - dimensional equipotential contours in 0 . 1 M KCl , with red and blue indicating negative and positive potentials , respec - tively . The electrostatic calculations performed used partial charges taken from the CHARMM27 ( 31 ) force field and spatial coordinates taken from the structures of free epsin ENTH ( 1INZ ) ( 32 ) , Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 - bound epsin ENTH ( 1H0A ) ( 8 ) , and CALM ANTH ( 1HFA ) ( 7 ) . RESULTS Monolayer Penetration Analysis of ENTH and ANTH Do - mains— Recent studies have indicated that phosphoinositides can induce the membrane penetration of FYVE ( 26 ) and PX ENTH - Membrane Interactions 28994 domains ( 33 ) . To see if PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 can also elicit the mem - brane penetration of ENTH and ANTH domains , we measured the interactions of epsin ENTH and AP180 ANTH domains with phospholipid monolayers in the presence and absence of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . Phospholipid monolayers at the air - water inter - face serve as a highly sensitive tool to measure the membrane penetrating ability of protein ( 22 , 34 – 36 ) . In these studies , POPC / POPE ( 80 : 20 ) or POPC / POPE / PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( 77 : 20 : 3 ) monolayers of a given initial surface pressure ( (cid:4) 0 ) were spread at constant area and the change in surface pressure ( (cid:3) (cid:4) ) was monitored after the injection of the protein into the subphase . In general , (cid:3) (cid:4) is inversely proportional to (cid:4) 0 of the phospho - lipid monolayer and an extrapolation of the (cid:3) (cid:4) versus (cid:4) 0 plot yields the critical surface pressure ( (cid:4) c ) , which specifies an upper limit of (cid:4) 0 of a monolayer that a protein can penetrate into ( 21 , 22 ) . Since the surface pressure of cell membranes and large unilamellar vesicles has been estimated to be in the range of 30 – 35 dyne / cm ( 37 – 39 ) , for a protein to penetrate these bilayer membranes its (cid:4) c value should be above 30 dyne / cm . Fig . 1 shows that toward the POPC / POPE ( 80 : 20 ) monolayer both epsin ENTH and AP180 ANTH domains have low intrin - sic penetrating ability with (cid:4) c values of 21 and 24 dyne / cm , respectively . However , the addition of 3 mol % PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 to the monolayer ( i . e . POPC / POPE / PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( 77 : 20 : 3 ) ) in - creased the (cid:4) c value of the epsin ENTH domain to 32 dyne / cm , suggesting that PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 might allow penetration of the domain into cell membranes and large unilamellar vesicles . The specific nature of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 activation was evidenced by a much smaller effect of 3 mol % phosphatidylinositol 3 , 4 - bisphosphate ( Fig . 1 ) on the (cid:4) c value for the epsin ENTH domain . Furthermore , neither 3 mol % phosphatidylinositol 3 , 4 , 5 - triphosphate nor 30 mol % POPS had a significant effect ( data not shown ) . Interestingly , the incorporation of 3 mol % PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 into the POPC / POPE ( 80 : 20 ) monolayer did not significantly change the (cid:4) c value of the AP180 ANTH domain , showing that PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 does not induce the membrane penetration of the AP180 ANTH domain . This also suggests that the ANTH domain cannot effectively penetrate compactly packed lipid bilayers , including cell membranes , even in the presence of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . Surface Plasmon Resonance Measurements of Membrane Binding of ENTH and ANTH Domains— The lipid headgroup specificity of the epsin ENTH domain and the AP180 ANTH domain has been determined using soluble inositol lipids . For instance , the epsin ENTH domain binds monomeric Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ( K d (cid:5) 3 . 6 (cid:2) M ) 33 times more strongly than mono - meric inositol 1 , 3 , 5 - triphosphate ( 8 ) . Also , the epsin ENTH domain has 8 - fold higher affinity for Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 than the AP180 ANTH domain ( 8 ) . However , their specificity and affin - ity for membrane - incorporated phosphoinositides has not been fully investigated . We first measured the affinity of the epsin ENTH domain for various phosphoinositide - containing vesicles ( i . e . POPC / POPE / phosphoinositide ( 77 : 20 : 3 ) ) using POPC / POPE ( 80 : 20 ) vesicles as a control . As listed in Table I , the epsin ENTH domain showed high affinity for POPC / POPE / PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( 77 : 20 : 3 ) vesicles ( K d (cid:5) 23 (cid:6) 7 n M ) . It should be noted that for our SPR vesicle binding analysis K d is defined as the dissociation constant for vesicle binding ( not for phospho - inositide binding ) in terms of the molarity of protein - binding sites on the vesicle , which is composed of n lipids ( 22 ) ( see “Experimental Procedures” ) . Thus , the large difference be - tween the K d for monomeric Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 and the K d for POPC / POPE / PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( 77 : 20 : 3 ) vesicles does not reflect the dif - ferent affinities of the domain for monomeric and membrane - incorporated PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . When compared with POPC / POPE / PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( 77 : 20 : 3 ) vesicles , the epsin ENTH domain had much lower affinity for POPC / POPE / phosphatidyl - inositol 3 , 4 - bisphosphate ( 77 : 20 : 3 ) and POPC / POPE / phos - phatidylinositol 3 , 4 , 5 - trisphosphate ( 77 : 20 : 3 ) vesicles . Lower estimates of K d for these vesicles assessed from the protein concentrations employed for the SPR measurements were 10 (cid:2) M , indicating that the epsin ENTH domain prefers mem - brane - incorporated PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 to other phosphoinositides by more than two orders of magnitude . The AP180 ANTH domain also had high specificity for PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - containing vesicles . For the same POPC / POPE / PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( 77 : 20 : 3 ) vesicles ; however , the AP180 ANTH domain showed 12 - fold lower affinity than the epsin ENTH domain . This difference in K d is due to a 2 . 7 - fold larger k a and a 4 . 3 - fold smaller k d for the ENTH domain . The membrane association of peripheral proteins can be accelerated by long range electrostatic interactions ( 24 ) , and the larger k a for the ENTH domain is consistent with its more positive electrostatic potential , especially around the PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - binding site when compared with the ANTH domain ( 6 – 8 ) ( see also Fig . 3 ) . On the other hand , the membrane dissociation step of periph - eral proteins can be slowed by short range specific interactions and membrane penetration of hydrophobic residues ( 24 ) . Thus , the smaller k d value of the epsin ENTH domain in comparison to the AP180 ANTH domain is consistent with our monolayer penetration data showing that the former penetrates more effectively into PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - containing monolayers than the latter . To further demonstrate that PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 has differen - tial effects on the membrane binding of the ENTH and ANTH domains , we measured the vesicle binding of these domains as a function of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and KCl concentrations . When the PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 content in the vesicles was reduced from 3 to 0 . 5 mol % , the k a decreased 5 . 4 - and 9 - fold for the epsin ENTH domain and the AP180 ANTH domain , respectively . However , the reduction in PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 content had little effect on the k d of the ANTH domain but caused a 2 - fold increase the k d for epsin ENTH . This difference again underscores the specific F IG . 1 . Monolayer penetration of epsin ENTH and AP180 ANTH domains . (cid:3) (cid:4) was monitored as a function of (cid:4) 0 values for epsin ENTH ( E ) and AP180 ANTH ( (cid:2) ) with a POPC / POPE ( 80 : 20 ) mono - layer . The same measurements were performed for epsin ENTH ( (cid:1) ) and AP180 ANTH ( f ) with a POPC / POPE / PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( 77 : 20 : 3 ) mono - layer . Also , the penetration of epsin ENTH into a POPC / POPE / phos - phatidylinositol 3 , 4 - bisphosphate ( 77 : 20 : 3 ) monolayer ( Œ ) was meas - ured . The subphase was 10 m M HEPES buffer , pH 7 . 4 , with 0 . 16 M KCl for all measurements . ENTH - Membrane Interactions 28995 effect of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 on the membrane penetration of the ENTH domain . Increasing the ionic strength of medium ( i . e . from 0 . 16 to 0 . 5 M KCl ) slowed the adsorption of the ENTH domain to POPC / POPE / PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( 77 : 20 : 3 ) vesicles by 45 - fold ( i . e . smaller k a ) but prolonged its membrane residence by 3 - fold ( i . e . smaller k d ) . In contrast , the binding of the AP180 ANTH domain to the same vesicles was not detectable in the presence of 0 . 5 M KCl , again indicating that the ANTH domain interacts mainly with the membrane surface by nonspecific electrostatic interactions . Together , these results indicate that while the membrane association of both the epsin ENTH do - main and the AP180 ANTH domain is driven primarily by nonspecific electrostatic interactions , the membrane dissocia - tion of the former is uniquely governed by hydrophobic forces , due to its PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - induced membrane penetration . Mutational Analysis of the Epsin ENTH Domain— To inves - tigate the membrane penetration mechanism of the ENTH domain , we mutated the hydrophobic Leu 6 and Met 10 residues on helix 0 to glutamine and tested the effects on monolayer penetration . The L6Q and M10Q mutants bind the PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 headgroup with nearly wild - type affinity , whereas liposome tubulation is abolished ( 8 ) . As shown in Fig . 2 , the L6Q and M10Q mutations greatly reduced the monolayer penetration of the epsin ENTH domain to the POPC / POPE / PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( 77 : 20 : 3 ) monolayer , indicating the importance of the hydrophobic residues on helix 0 in PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - induced membrane penetration . This reduction in penetration was PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 specific , as these mutations did not greatly re - duce the penetration into a POPC / POPE ( 80 : 20 ) monolayer ( data not shown ) . In contrast , the mutation of Arg 114 to Ala had little effect on the monolayer penetration . Finally , a double - site mutation of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - binding residues ( R63L / H73L ) caused significantly reduced penetration to the POPC / POPE / PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( 77 : 20 : 3 ) monolayer , supporting the notion that PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding is prerequisite for the membrane pene - tration of helix 0 . The reason this mutation did not have as a dramatic effect as the L6Q and M10Q mutations was likely to be due to intrinsically high monolayer penetration power of R63L / H73L caused by the introduction of two hydrophobic residues near the membrane binding surface . This notion is supported by the finding that R63L / H73L could penetrate the POPC / POPE ( 80 : 20 ) monolayer almost as effectively as the POPC / POPE / PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( 77 : 20 : 3 ) monolayer ( see Fig . 2 ) . We then measured the vesicle binding of these mutants by the SPR analysis . For POPC / POPE / PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( 77 : 20 : 3 ) ves - icles , R63L / H73L showed extremely low affinity ( K d (cid:7) 25 (cid:2) M ) , underscoring the importance of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding in the overall membrane affinity of the ENTH domain . It should be noted that although this mutant has the higher intrinsic mono - layer penetrating ability ( see above ) , it still cannot penetrate the PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 – containing vesicles ( i . e . (cid:4) c (cid:8) 30 dyne / cm ) and has a drastically reduced positive electrostatic potential , which may be important for initial electrostatic vesicle binding ( see below ) . L6Q and M10Q had 12 - and 38 - fold lower affinity , respectively , than the wild type , primarily due to larger k d values . The faster membrane dissociation of these mutants is F IG . 2 .

ENTH - Membrane Interactions 28996 consistent with their less favorable hydrophobic interaction with the membrane . R114A had 4 - fold lower K d , due to a smaller k a . Although this residue is not part of the PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - binding site , it is on the same side of the putative membrane binding surface ( see Fig . 4 ) and could contribute to nonspecific electrostatic interactions . Calculation of Electrostatic Potential— To account for the differences in PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - mediated membrane binding prop - erties of the epsin ENTH domain and the AP180 ANTH do - main , we calculated the electrostatic potential for these do - mains in the absence and presence of Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 that is a soluble analog of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . It was shown that PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding causes a local conformation change of the ENTH domain involving the formation of helix 0 ( 8 ) . However , it is not known as to which conformation the epsin ENTH domain would assume when it initially contacts the PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - containing membrane surface ( i . e . a membrane - bound PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - free conformation ) . Thus , the electrostatic potential of the ENTH domain in the absence of Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 was calculated for the structures both before and after the conformational change . As shown in Fig . 3 , A and B , strong positive potentials were seen near the PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - binding pocket for both structures of Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 - free epsin ENTH , due to the presence of basic residues involved in PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding ( i . e . Arg 8 , Lys 11 , Arg 25 , Arg 63 , Lys 69 , and His 73 ) . These positive potentials may initially contribute to recruiting the domain to the anionic membrane surface through nonspecific electrostatic attraction , which subsequently leads to productive PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding . Notice that the high positive potential of the induced structure ( Fig . 3 B ) also surrounds the hydrophobic residues ( i . e . Leu 6 and Met 10 ) of helix 0 , which is expected to produce an energy barrier against the penetration of these residues into the low dielectric membrane interface . This is because the desolvation that is prerequisite for their mem - brane penetration would disrupt favorable interactions be - tween water molecules and charged and polar groups on both the protein and the membrane . Interestingly , the positive po - tential of the epsin ENTH domain is dramatically reduced when PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binds to the domain ( Fig . 3 C ) . This sug - gests that PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 may serve as an electrostatic switch to decrease the highly positive potential surrounding the hydro - phobic residues on helix 0 , thereby facilitating their membrane penetration . Thus , it would seem that for the ENTH domain PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 plays a dual role of inducing a conformation change and switching the electrostatic potential . Electrostatic potentials calculations of the ANTH domain are also consistent with our monolayer and SPR data . As shown in Fig . 3 D , the ANTH domain has a lower positive electrostatic potential than the ENTH domain in the absence of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( Fig . 3 B ) , which is consistent with its smaller k a . The docking of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 to the ANTH domain leads to a charge neutralization ( Fig . 3 E ) , but unlike the ENTH domain , the ANTH domain lacks hydrophobic residues on the mem - brane binding surface that would productively interact with the membrane . As a result , the electrostatic switch by F IG . 3 . Effects of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 on the electrostatic potential of epsin ENTH and AP180 - ANTH .

Proposed membrane binding mechanisms for the ENTH and ANTH domains . The ANTH domain ( A ) binds to PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - containing membranes primarily through electrostatic interactions with PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 acting as a bridge . Only minor changes in protein conformation and membrane structure are expected . Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 is shown in space filling representation and the side chains of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - binding basic residues are shown in aqua . For the epsin ENTH domain ( B ) , nonspecific electrostatic interactions initially bring the protein to the membrane surface , which induces the formation of helix 0 and the PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - binding pocket . The subsequent PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding locks this conformation and concomitantly causes the hydrophobic residues in the helix to insert into the membrane . This membrane insertion elongates the membrane residence time of the protein and triggers the membrane deformation . Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 is shown in space filling representation . The side chains of basic residues and hydrophobic residues are shown in aqua and red , respectively . The coordinates are taken from the x - ray structures of CALM ANTH ( 7 ) and epsin ENTH domain ( 8 ) . ENTH - Membrane Interactions 28997 PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 has no functional consequences for the ANTH domain . Taken together , our electrostatic calculations sup - ported the notion that PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 plays differential roles in the membrane binding of ENTH and ANTH domains . DISCUSSION Clathrin - mediated endocytosis involves a number of acces - sory proteins that control vesicle budding through protein - protein and lipid - protein interactions ( 40 ) . Although it was long thought that clathrin is sufficient to drive membrane budding , recent evidence has established that the membrane bending requires concerted action of these accessory proteins ( 41 ) . Among these proteins , epsin ( 8 ) , dynamin ( 42 ) , amphiphysin ( 43 ) , and endophilin ( 44 ) have been shown to be able to cause liposome tubulation independently in vitro . However , ques - tions remain as to whether all these proteins are directly in - volved in vesicle budding in vivo and how they initiate the vesicle budding . The present study provides some mechanistic insight into how epsin initiates the membrane curvature through lipid - protein interactions . A recent study showed that the ENTH domain of epsin was as effective as the full - length protein in causing liposome tu - bulation , while neither AP180 nor its ANTH domain could induce the liposome tubulation independently ( 8 ) . A main structural difference between the ENTH domain and the ANTH domain lies in the ligand - binding site ( 8 ) . The ANTH domain does not have a well defined PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - binding pocket and instead uses surface exposed basic residues to co - ordinate the ligand . The ENTH domain also lacks a well de - fined ligand - binding pocket ; however , for this domain the for - mation of the pocket is triggered by PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding . The same conformational change also aligns the hydrophobic resi - dues , Leu 6 , Met 10 , and Ile 13 , toward the membrane surface . These structural differences between the two domains are translated into their distinct membrane binding properties . Our monolayer measurements clearly show that the ENTH domain can penetrate the PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - containing monolayer much more efficiently than the ANTH domain . Most signifi - cant , PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 specifically triggers the penetration of the ENTH domain , but not the ANTH domain , into the monolayer whose surface packing density recapitulates those of cell mem - branes and large unilamellar vesicles . Neither other phospho - inositides nor phosphatidylserine can replace the effect of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 on the ENTH domain . This is similar to specific membrane penetration of FYVE domains and the PX domain of p40 phox induced by phosphatidylinositol 3 - phosphate ( 26 , 33 ) . Monolayer penetration properties of the ENTH domain mu - tants also verify the notion that hydrophobic residues on the same face of induced helix 0 are responsible for the membrane penetration of the ENTH domain . Our SPR measurements and electrostatic potential calcu - lations provide further insight into the differential PtdIns - ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 dependent membrane binding mechanisms of these two domains . The epsin ENTH domain binds the same PtdIns - ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - containing vesicles with 12 - fold greater affinity than the AP180 ANTH domain , due to faster association and slower dissociation . The faster membrane association of the epsin ENTH domain can be accounted for by its more positive elec - trostatic potential on its putative membrane binding surface , due to basic residues in the PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - binding pocket and Arg 114 ( see Fig . 3 ) . The slower dissociation of epsin ENTH is consistent with the higher degree of monolayer penetration by its hydrophobic residues , including Leu 6 and Met 10 . The 12 - and 38 - fold reductions in affinity by L6Q and M10Q mutations , respectively , indicate that membrane penetration of these res - idues contributes significantly to overall membrane binding of the ENTH domain . Variation of the PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 concentration and the ionic strength of the medium also underscores the different roles PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 play in membrane binding of the two domains . In the case of the ENTH domain , PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 enhances k a via electrostatic protein - PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 interactions , whereas it lowers k d by inducing membrane penetration of the hydropho - bic residues , and thereby allowing hydrophobic interactions . For the ANTH domain , on the other hand , PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 would seem to simply function as a bridge between the domain and the membrane , as suggested for the role of calcium in the membrane binding of annexins ( 45 ) . This is due to the presence of pre - aligned basic residues and the absence of hydrophobic residues on the PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding surface . Based on these data , we propose differential membrane bind - ing mechanisms for the two domains ( see Fig . 4 ) . The epsin ENTH domain initially binds to PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - containing ani - onic membranes by nonspecific electrostatic interactions . The nature of membrane - bound PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - free conformation is not known at present . However , it would be reasonable to assume that the initial membrane contact induces , at least partially , the formation of the helix 0 and hence the PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - binding pocket , since the induction of am - phipathic helices at the water - membrane interface has been well documented ( 46 – 48 ) . The subsequent PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 bind - ing would then lock this induced conformation , as shown in the crystal structure of the epsin ENTH - Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 complex ( 8 ) , concomitantly inducing the hydrophobic residues in the helix to insert into the membrane by the electrostatic switch mecha - nism . This membrane insertion elongates the membrane resi - dence time of the protein and triggers the membrane deforma - tion . For the ANTH domain , membrane - protein binding takes place primarily through electrostatic interactions with PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 acting as a bridge . Only minor changes in protein conformation and membrane structure are expected . Multiple steps of complex protein - protein and protein - lipid interactions are involved in the vesicle budding . Our results strongly suggest that the PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - triggered membrane penetration of the ENTH domain is a critical step in the epsin - induced membrane curvature . This notion is supported by much reduced monolayer penetration of L6Q and M10Q mu - tants that have lost the liposome tubulation activity of the wild type epsin ENTH domain . The penetration of the ENTH do - main into the PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - rich region of the plasma mem - brane would cause the positive membrane curvature , which has been suggested to be essential for membrane budding ( 49 ) . Intriguingly , there are many peripheral proteins , including phosphoinositide - specific FYVE domains and PX domains , which penetrate lipid monolayers as well as or more effectively than the epsin ENTH domain without inducing liposome tubu - lation . Perhaps the insertion of a relatively rigid (cid:1) - helix dis - torts the membrane enough to cause curvature , while insertion of a less ordered loop may be insufficient . Further mechanistic studies on the membrane - ENTH domain interactions would reveal the molecular basis of this special activity of the epsin ENTH domain . REFERENCES 1 .
