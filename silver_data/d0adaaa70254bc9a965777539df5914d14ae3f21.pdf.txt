Serum samples collected from 299 randomly - selected adults and 218 30 cohabitants ( N = 517 ) were tested by chemiluminescence immunoassay ten 31 weeks after the first reported case . Weighted overall seroprevalence was 4 . 7 % 32 ( 95 % CI 3 . 0 - 6 . 6 % ) . The low seroprevalence suggests that most of this population 33 could still be infected . Serial serosurveys were initiated aiming to monitor the 34 progress of the ongoing pandemic throughout the entire city . This may help 35 inform public health authority decisions regarding prevention and control 36 strategies . 37 38 39 40 Keywords : COVID - 19 , SARS - CoV - 2 , epidemiological survey , adult , serological 41 test , Immunoglobulin M ; Immunoglobulin G , Brazil 42 43 44 .

In Brazil , the first laboratory - confirmed case was reported on February 26 , 49 2020 . The patient was a 61 - year - old male resident in São Paulo City , who had 50 returned from a visit to Lombardy ( Italy ) a few days previously [ 1 ] . On March 13 th , 51 2020 , the Brazilian Ministry of Health declared that community transmission had 52 been established as a scaling up of cases of COVID - 19 had been observed in 53 multiple sites in the country and on March 24 , the State of Sao Paulo declared a 54 statewide quarantine . Highly urbanized with a population of approximately 11 . 6 55 million people and a high level of socioeconomic inequality , São Paulo City has 56 been the epicenter of the COVID - 19 epidemics in Brazil since then , registering 57 560 cases per 100 . 000 inhabitants , compared to the national figure of 249 cases 58 per 100 . 000 as of 31 May 2020 [ 2 ] . 59 Due to an extremely low testing capacity , epidemic projections and policies 60 addressing COVID - 19 in Brazil have been designed without robust data to inform 61 epidemic parameters . Seroprevalence surveys are important for measuring the 62 proportion of the general population who have been infected and have produced 63 SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies [ 3 ] , which in turn , may confer protection ( at least in the 64 short term ) against the infection . 65 We report results from a population - based household serosurvey planned to 66 determine the prevalence of antibodies to SARS - CoV - 2 in adults in six districts 67 in São Paulo City , Brazil . We also investigated possible associations between 68 .

Overall , 298 . 240 inhabitants aged 18 years old 80 or more live in these districts [ 6 ] . 81 All adults aged 18 years or older who were capable of understanding the 82 information provided by the research teams were eligible to participate . A sample 83 size of 500 households , one person per household , was planned to allow the 84 estimation of the prevalence of seropositivity greater than 4 % to be obtained 85 under coefficients of variation of less than 30 % . To allow for non - contact and 86 refusals , 1049 households were randomly selected and surveyed . 87 Between May 4 and May 12 2020 , field teams approached all households and 88 randomly selected one member from each household . After providing written and 89 verbal information on the study , the team invited the selected resident to 90 participate . After obtaining informed consent from the participant , the team 91 .

Blood was collected by venipuncture following the interview . Other 94 household members ( cohabitants ) who were interested in participating in the 95 study , followed the same procedures . The study was approved by the Fleury 96 Institutional Ethical Committee ( CAAE 31032620 . 0 . 0000 . 5474 ) . 97 Specimen collection and laboratory tests 98 Samples were transported from the collection sites to the Serology Laboratory of 99 Grupo Fleury where they were separated by centrifugation , aliquoted , and stored 100 frozen until analysis , shortly after collection . All sera were tested for the presence 101 of SARS - CoV - 2 specific antibodies using the commercial kits “MAGLUMI IgM 102 2019 - nCoV” and “MAGLUMI IgG 2019 - nCoV” ( chemiluminescence 103 immunoassay - CLIA ) supplied by Bioscience Co ( China National Medical 104 Products Administration : approval numbers 20203400183 ( IgG ) and 105 20203400182 ( IgM ) ; and Brazilian ANVISA RE 860 and 861 / 2020 ) . 106 CLIA for IgG and IgM detection was developed based on a double - antibody 107 sandwich immunoassay . The recombinant antigens containing the nucleoprotein 108 and a peptide from the spike protein of SARS - CoV - 2 were conjugated with FITC 109 and immobilized on anti - FITC antibody - conjugated magnetic particles . Alkaline 110 phosphatase - conjugated anti - human IgG and IgM was used as the detection 111 antibody . The tests were conducted on an automated magnetic 112 chemiluminescence analyzer ( Axceed 260 , Bioscience ) according to the 113 manufacturer’s instructions . The antibody titer was tested once per serum 114 sample . 115 .

The diagnostic performance of CLIA has 117 been evaluated in the literature [ 7 - 11 ] . Although the sensitivity and specificity 118 improve during the progression of infection , sensitivity for IgM is 100 % and 119 specificity 94 . 1 % twenty days after symptoms onset . The IgG sensitivity and 120 specificity , twenty days after the onset of symptoms is 100 % and 99 . 5 % 121 respectively [ 7 ] . 122 To determine the reference values , samples from patients diagnosed with the 123 COVID - 19 RT - PCR test and samples from control groups such as blood donors , 124 employees without flu symptoms vaccinated in 2020 , a panel of samples that 125 tested positive for other non - SARS - CoV - 2 respiratory viruses , and samples from 126 carriers of other infectious diseases were used . The results of analyzing of these 127 samples led to the following reference values : IgG : reagent > 1 . 1 UA / mL , 128 indeterminate 0 . 9 to 1 . 1 UA / mL , non - reagent < 0 . 9 UA / mL ; and IgM : reagent > 1 . 0 129 UA / mL , indeterminate 0 . 7 to 1 . 0 UA / mL , non - reagent < 0 . 7 UA / mL . Individuals 130 who were reactive to either IgM or IgG were considered positive . 131 Data analysis 132 Prevalence estimates were obtained for two groups separately : randomly - 133 selected residents and cohabitants . Data were analyzed for both groups and 134 were weighted according to the sampling design , which in turn , were adjusted 135 considering response rates and post - stratification by age and sex , according to 136 the district population structure in 2020 [ 6 ] . Prevalence estimates with 95 % 137 confidence intervals ( CI ) were calculated for selected characteristics , and 138 frequency distributions of self - reported symptoms were compared between 139 .

Differences in proportions were 140 assessed by the design - based F test . A p - value < 0 . 05 was considered to be 141 statistically significant . Indeterminate results were included as negative in the 142 analyses . STATA version 14 ( StataCorp , College Station , TX , USA ) was used for 143 all statistical analyses . 144 Results 145 Out of 771 contacted households , 299 ( 38 . 5 % participation rate ) randomly - 146 selected residents agreed to participate in the study , as did 218 cohabitants . The 147 seroprevalence for SARS - CoV - 2 was 4 . 8 % ( 95 % CI 2 . 6 - 7 . 0 % ) for selected 148 residents and overall seroprevalence , including test results for the 218 voluntary 149 cohabitants , was 4 . 7 % ( 95 % CI 3 . 0 - 6 . 6 % ) . 150 Of the 27 SARS - CoV - 2 seropositive individuals , 20 were IgG positive / IgM 151 negative , six were IgG negative / IgM positive , and one was IgG positive / IgM 152 positive . 153 Socio - demographic characteristics of all 517 tested people stratified by SARS - 154 CoV - 2 seroprevalence estimates are shown in Table 1 . Briefly , 54 . 9 % were 155 female , 52 % aged between 18 and 44 years , 65 % self - reported as being white 156 and 46 . 4 % had a university degree ( 16 years or more of schooling ) . Comparisons 157 of seroprevalence show that people who reported brown and black skin color 158 presented significantly higher SARS - CoV - 2 seroprevalence compared to those 159 with white skin . Nine or more years of schooling was associated with lower 160 seroprevalence than low education level . Participants who reported one or more 161 SARS - CoV - 2 - related symptoms in the past two weeks showed higher 162 seropositivity than asymptomatic people , but this difference was not statistically 163 significant ( 6 . 7 % vs . 3 . 5 % ; P = . 0801 ) . 164 .

Twelve 166 ( 45 . 3 % ) of the 27 seropositive individuals did not report symptoms . SARS - CoV - 167 2 - seropositive individuals were significantly more likely to experience symptoms 168 such as fatigue , diarrhea , ageusia , and anosmia than seronegative residents . 169 None of the seropositive individuals reported previous diagnoses of infection . 170 Discussion 171 There are limited data available on the seroprevalence of SARS - CoV - 2 infection 172 in Brazil . In this study , an overall seroprevalence for anti - SARS - CoV - 2 of 4 . 7 % 173 was observed . This estimate probably reflects the upper limit in the city of São 174 Paulo since the selected districts were those with the highest number of cases 175 and deaths in the city . One study , which used the Wondfo rapid antibody test , 176 found a SARS - CoV - 2 seroprevalence of 3 . 1 % on May 17 [ 12 ] . Our findings were 177 similar to this study , although seroprevalence estimates should be compared with 178 caution , as the representativeness of the population covered , and laboratory 179 testing methods differed between studies . 180 Besides assessing the magnitude of the pandemic in chosen areas of São Paulo 181 City , we looked at possible associations between selected risk factors for SARS - 182 CoV - 2 infection and the presence of SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies . Previous reports 183 have linked SARS - CoV - 2 infections with no or minor symptoms [ 1 , 13 , 14 ] . We 184 found results in the same direction , 45 . 3 % of seropositive individuals reported no 185 symptoms in the two weeks before the survey . Similar to studies on the frequency 186 of SARS - CoV - 2 - related symptoms , anosmia , ageusia , fatigue and diarrhea were 187 .

It is noteworthy that SARS - CoV - 188 2 - related clinical symptoms and signs remain poorly documented in Brazil . 189 The strengths of the current research are that it is the first household population - 190 based serosurvey in Brazil using a chemiluminescence assay , a very precise 191 technique to detect immunoglobulins against SARS - CoV - 2 . This test together 192 with the probabilistic sampling design provided a clear picture of the extent of 193 human exposure to SARS - CoV - 2 in the studied regions . 194 There are some limitations to the study . First , since it was a cross - sectional study , 195 temporal associations cannot be established and data are lacking on variables 196 related to the epidemiology of SARS - CoV - 2 , such as the history of exposure and 197 severity of symptoms . Second , refusal bias may have been introduced as a result 198 of non - response , which occurred mainly due to non - cooperation by the managers 199 of some residential blocks and to residents’ unwillingness to donate blood . Third , 200 we have not included children or young people under 18 years due to logistic 201 restrictions . Last , the statistical power may have been insufficient to detect 202 differences between subgroups . However , we believe that these issues have not 203 affected our findings significantly , considering that our results are consistent with 204 several worldwide reports that showed low prevalence of SARS - CoV - 2 infection 205 in the general population even in highly affected regions [ 12 , 13 , 15 ] . 206 In conclusion , the overall exposure to SARS - CoV - 2 in the general population in 207 the research areas is low , indicating that a significant proportion of this population 208 could still be infected . Following these initial results , a series of six monthly point - 209 prevalence serosurveys , using similar methodology and the same testing 210 method , has been initiated . By monitoring the SARS - CoV - 2 seroprevalence in a 211 population - representative sample , as well as the ongoing pandemic in São Paulo 212 .
