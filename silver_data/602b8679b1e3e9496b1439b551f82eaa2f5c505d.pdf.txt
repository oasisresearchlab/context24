Introduction Cell morphology and motility depend on the remodeling of the cytoskeletal architecture and require locally restricted membrane protrusion and invagination , driven by cycles of actin polymerization and depolymerization ( Carlier et al . , 2003 ; Pollard et al . , 2000 ; Pollard and Borisy , 2003 ) . Site - restricted generation of free barbed ﬁlament ends is the ﬁrst step in the assembly process of new actin structures in cells . The Arp2 / 3 complex plays an important role in the temporal and spatial control of actin polymerization ( Welch et al . , 1998 ) . After activation by the Wiskott / Aldrich - syndrome protein ( WASP ) , this complex nucleates a branched actin network ( Amann and Pollard , 2001 ; Machesky and Insall , 1998 ) found , for example , in the lamellipodium , a broad membrane protrusion found at the leading edge of migrating cells ( Svitkina and Borisy , 1999 ) . However , in addition to dendritic actin networks , cells also harbor structures like microvilli and microspikes , which contain a bundle of parallel - aligned actin ﬁlaments ( Bartles , 2000 ) . Although less dynamic than branched actin networks , the parallel array of actin ﬁlaments of these structures continuously turns over and monomer addition to the plasma - membrane - oriented ﬁlament plus ends is required for protrusive force generation ( Loomis et al . , 2003 ; Mooseker et al . , 1982 ) . Several lines of evidence support a role for actin cross - linking proteins in the biogenesis and maintenance of the actin cytoskeleton of these structures . Overexpression of actin - bundling proteins in cultured cells causes the elongation of the microvillar F - actin core bundle and affects its turnover ( Arpin et al . , 1994 ; Friederich et al . , 1989 ; Loomis et al . , 2003 ) . Recent work supports the view that F - actin cross - linking proteins might interfere with Arp2 / 3 - complex - dependent actin assembly . For example , the actin - cross - linking protein EPLIN inhibits secondary activation of branching nucleation by the Arp2 / 3 complex and reduces the frequency of branches in vitro ( Maul et al . , 2003 ) . Consistent with a role in reshaping dendritic networks in cells , the actin - bundling protein fascin appeared to be required for the reorganization of Arp2 / 3 - nucleated branched networks into bundles in a cell - free assay ( Vignjevic et al . , 2003 ) . Although these ﬁndings suggest that actin - cross - linking proteins might contribute to actin - based force generation by reorganizing Arp2 / 3 - complex - dependent actin networks , direct experimental evidence for such a mechanism is so far lacking . T - Plastin ( Bretscher , 1981 ) , also named T - ﬁmbrin , is a representative of an important family of actin - cross - linking and - bundling proteins ( Gimona et al . , 2002 ) that organize most of the actin networks in cells . T - Plastin is associated with the actin 1255 Increasing evidence suggests that actin cross - linking or bundling proteins might not only structure the cortical actin cytoskeleton but also control actin dynamics . Here , we analyse the effects of T - plastin / T - ﬁmbrin , a representative member of an important actin - ﬁlament cross - linking protein by combining a quantitative biomimetic motility assay with biochemical and cell - based approaches . Beads coated with the VCA domain of the Wiskott / Aldrich - syndrome protein ( WASP ) recruit the actin - nucleating Arp2 / 3 complex , polymerize actin at their surface and undergo movement when placed in cell - free extracts . T - Plastin increased the velocity of VCA beads 1 . 5 times , stabilized actin comets and concomitantly displaced coﬁlin , an actin - depolymerizing protein . T - Plastin also decreased the F - actin disassembly rate and inhibited coﬁlin - mediated depolymerization of actin ﬁlaments in vitro . Importantly , a bundling - incompetent variant comprising the ﬁrst actin - binding domain ( ABD1 ) had similar effects . In cells , this domain induced the formation of long actin cables to which other actin - regulating proteins were recruited . Altogether , these results favor a mechanism in which binding of ABD1 controls actin turnover independently of cross - link formation . In vivo , this activity might contribute to the assembly and maintenance of the actin cytoskeleton of plasma - membrane protrusions .

In mesenchymal cells , T - plastin localizes to focal adhesions and the leading edge ( Arpin et al . , 1994 ) , a broad lamellar membrane extension harboring a dynamic branched actin network ( Svitkina and Borisy , 1999 ) . How T - plastin might contribute to actin - based force generation and actin assembly is the question we address here . Using a cell - free motility assay , biochemical and cell - based approaches , we show that T - plastin can augment actin - based force in a dose - dependent manner and stabilize actin structures , which elongate . Importantly , a bundling - incompetent T - plastin variant had similar effects , demonstrating that the activity of T - plastin is not limited to ﬁlament cross - linking . We propose a novel mechanism of action for T - plastin in which this protein might contribute to actin assembly independently of cross - link formation . Materials and Methods Cell culture Vero monkey kidney cells [ CCL - 81 ; American Type cell Culture ( ATCC ) , Rockville , MD ] and human HeLa cells ( ATCC CCL - 2 ) were grown in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum at 37°C in a 10 % CO 2 atmosphere . Antibodies and ﬂuorochrome - coupled probes The monoclonal antibody P5D4 , raised against the 11 - amino - acid C - terminus of the vesicular stomatitis virus ( vsv ) glycoprotein G , and the affinity - puriﬁed T - plastin - speciﬁc polyclonal antibody have been described previously ( Kreis , 1986 ; Lapillonne et al . , 2000 ) . The speciﬁcity of the affinity - puriﬁed polyclonal anti - plastin antibody raised against full - length recombinant human L - plastin was determined by western blot . The antibody reacted with recombinant human L - and T - plastin , and recognized a single protein of 67 kDa in HeLa extracts . Monoclonal mouse IgM antibody against bovine α - actinin was purchased from Sigma and monoclonal mouse IgG anti - human - VASP antibody from BD Transduction Laboratories . Monoclonal antibody against coﬁlin was a kind gift from I . Yahara and K . Moriyama ( Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science , Tokyo , Japan ) . Alexa - 488 - coupled donkey anti - rabbit or anti - mouse IgG antibodies and Alexa - 320 - coupled phalloidin were purchased from Molecular Probes . Rhodamine - coupled phalloidin was purchased from Sigma . Texas - Red - coupled goat anti - rabbit IgG and Cy2 - coupled goat anti - IgM / IgG was obtained from Jackson Laboratories . N - Pyrenyliodoacetamide was purchased from Molecular Probes . DNA constructs and proteins The pCB6 - T - plastin and the pUHD - 10 - 3 - ABD1 ( kindly supplied by P . J . Sansonnetti , Institut Pasteur , Paris , France ) expression constructs have been described previously ( Adam et al . , 1995 ; Arpin et al . , 1994 ) . DNA fragments encoding T - plastin or T - plastin’s ﬁrst actin - binding domain ( ABD1 ) were inserted into the Bam HI - Eco RI sites of the pGEX - 2T vector . Recombinant T - plastin , ABD1 and the VCA domain of WASP , N - terminally fused to glutathione - 5 - transferase ( VCA - GST ) were produced and puriﬁed as described ( Arpin et al . , 1994 ; Golsteyn et al . , 1997 ) . Actin was prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle ( Spudich and Watt , 1971 ) and further puriﬁed using Sephacryl S - 300 ( Pharmacia ) in G - buffer [ 5 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 7 , 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 2 mM dithiothreitol ( DTT ) , 0 . 01 % NaN 3 ] . It was pyrene labeled on Cys374 following Kouyama and Michashi ( Kouyama and Mihashi , 1981 ) . The human villin headpiece cDNA sequence ( villin - HP ) , which codes for the last 67 residues ( 720 - 826 ) of villin ( Rossenu et al . , 2003 ) , was cloned in a bacterial expression system ( pET11d ; Novagen ) . The resulting recombinantly produced villin headpiece domain was puriﬁed as described ( Vardar et al . , 1999 ) and stored in 50 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 0 , 0 . 025 mM EDTA . Human coﬁlin1 cDNA was cloned in pKM263 ( Melcher , 2000 ) obtained from EUROSCARF and produced as an N - terminally tagged glutathione - S - transferase ( GST ) fusion . The fusion protein and GST were puriﬁed using glutathione - Sepharose ( Pharmacia , protocol provided by manufacturer ) followed by a gel ﬁltration in 50 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 0 , 0 . 025 mM EDTA . Sedimentation of proteins with F - actin G - Actin from rabbit muscle was polymerized by the addition of 30 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM DTT , 0 . 1 mM ATP , 10 mM imidazole / HCl , 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 , 2 mM EGTA , 0 . 5 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 3 , in the absence or presence of T - plastin or ABD1 for 12 hours at 4°C under the conditions described in the ﬁgure legends . Proteins were sedimented for 30 minutes at 150 , 000 g in a Beckman TL100 ultracentrifuge to assess F - actin binding ( Friederich et al . , 1999 ) or at 12 , 000 g for 15 minutes to test bundling activity ( Glenney et al . , 1981b ) . To assess the Ca 2 + dependency of T - plastin binding to F - actin , T - plastin ( 3 µ M ) was polymerized with G - actin ( 7 µ M ) overnight at 4°C in the presence of increasing concentrations of free Ca 2 + and centrifuged for 30 minutes at 200 , 000 g . Free Ca 2 + concentrations was calculated using Webmaxc Standard software developed by Stanford University ( http : / / www . stanford . edu / ~ cpatton / webmaxc / webmaxcS . htm ) . Proteins in pellets and supernatants were analysed by sodium - dodecyl - sulfate polyacrylamide - gel electrophoresis ( SDS - PAGE ) as described ( Friederich et al . , 1999 ) . Motility assay and analysis of beads by epiﬂuorescence microscopy Polystyrene beads of 1 µ m diameter ( Polysciences ) were spread in ethanol on the bottom of a Petri dish and allowed to dry . SiO shadowing was then performed by evaporation of a 8 nm layer at 10 – 5 bar ( Cameron et al . , 1999 ) . Beads were resuspended in borate buffer and coated with GST - VCA protein at a concentration of 0 . 38 mg ml – 1 in PBS . Protein binding was measured by quantitative western blotting using anti - GST antibody ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) . Extracts from HeLa cells were prepared as described ( Fradelizi et al . , 2001 ) and contained a total protein concentration of 23 mg ml – 1 . The amounts of actin and T - plastin in extracts were measured by quantitative western blotting as described ( Fradelizi et al . , 1999 ) using anti - human - β - actin ( Sigma ) and anti - T - plastin ( Lapillonne et al . , 2000 ) primary antibodies , respectively . The total β - actin and T - plastin levels in the extract were 5 . 12 µ M and 2 . 06 µ M , respectively . 0 . 5 µ l beads were mixed with 8 µ l HeLa extract supplemented with 1 mM ATP , 30 mM creatine phosphate and 1 µ M Alexa - 568 - labelled actin ( Molecular Probes ) . The ﬁnal mixture was observed between slide and coverslip sealed with a mixture of lanolin , paraffin and vasolin ( 1 : 1 : 1 ) by ﬂuorescence and phase - contrast microscopy ( inverted Olympus microscope , BX51 , 100 × objective ) . Images were recorded every 5 seconds for 5 - 20 minutes and velocities measured using Metamorph tracking software ( Universal Imaging ) . For immunoﬂuorescence staining , 2 µ l bead - extract mixture was sandwiched between two coverslips , spaced by paraﬁlm strips . The chambers were opened after a 5 - minute incubation at room temperature in a solution containing 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 and 2 . 5 µ M phalloidin in CB ( 10 mM morpholino ethanesulfonic acid ( MES ) , 150 mM NaCl , 5 mM EGTA , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 5 mM glucose , pH 6 . 1 ) . After a 1 minute incubation , samples were ﬁxed in 2 . 5 µ M phalloidin , 1 % glutaraldehyde in CB and processed for immunoﬂuorescence staining with the antibodies indicated in ﬁgure legends . Identical exposure Journal of Cell Science 118 ( 6 ) J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e 1257 T - Plastin - dependent force generation times were used to acquire images of beads stained with the same antibodies . Images of comets were recorded using a linear CCD camera ( Coolsnap ; Princeton Instruments ) and integrated emission intensities of rhodamine and Alexa 488 were quantiﬁed in a square section of the actin tail two bead diameters behind the bead using MetaMorph software . F - Actin depolymerization assay Pyrene - labeled - F - actin ﬁlaments ( 4 µ M , 25 % pyrene labelled ) were prepared by a 30 minute incubation at room temperature in F buffer ( 0 . 5 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 7 , 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 , 30 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM EGTA , 10 mM imidazole , 0 . 1 mM ATP , 0 . 2 mM DTT ) in the presence or absence of different concentration of T - plastin , ABD1 or villin HP , as described in the ﬁgure legends . Depolymerization of F - actin was induced by dilution in F buffer to a ﬁnal concentration of 0 . 4 µ M in the presence or absence of GST - coﬁlin at the concentration indicated in the legends of the ﬁgures . The ﬂuorescence decrease was recorded over the course of 6 minutes by an F - 4500 ﬂuorimeter ( Hitachi ) ( excitation at 365 nm and emission at 388 nm ) . Transfection and epiﬂuorescence analysis of cells Electroporation of cells was carried out with 10 µ g plasmid for 5 × 10 6 cells at 240 V and 900 µ F . Cells were plated onto glass coverslips and analysed 48 hours after transfection . Cells were processed for immunoﬂuorescence staining as described previously ( Friederich et al . , 1999 ) . For triple staining , ABD1 - vsv transfected cells were labeled with Alexa - 320 - conjugated phalloidin as a probe for F - actin , anti - vsv - tag antibody followed by Texas - Red - coupled anti - rabbit IgG secondary antibody , mouse anti - α - actinin primary antibody followed by anti - mouse IgM / IgG Cy2 - coupled secondary antibody or mouse anti - VASP primary antibody followed by anti - mouse IgG secondary antibody . Cells were analysed by epiﬂuorescence microscopy ( Leica DMRX , HCX PL APO × 100 ) equipped with the appropriated excitation and emission ﬁlters . Images were acquired with a linear CCD camera ( Micromax ; Princeton Instruments ) and Metaview software ( Universal Imaging ) . Results We used a cell - free assay consisting of beads coated with the VCA domain of WASP and placed in HeLa - cell extracts ( Fradelizi et al . , 2001 ; Noireaux et al . , 2000 ) to asses how T - plastin participates in actin assembly and force generation . The VCA domain speciﬁcally recruits the actin - nucleating Arp2 / 3 complex to the bead surface . VCA beads undergo actin - polymerization - driven motility , accompanied by the assembly of a comet - like structure composed of F - actin . This system is extremely powerful for a qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the relative contributions of cytoskeletal components to the assembly of actin structures ( Fradelizi et al . , 2001 ; Vignjevic et al . , 2003 ) and actin - based movement ( Bernheim - Groswasser et al . , 2002 ) . Asymmetric polystyrene beads with a 1 µ m diameter were asymmetrically coated with VCA ( Cameron et al . , 1999 ) . Once placed in HeLa - cell extracts , 50 % of the VCA - coated beads started to move within 2 minutes , propelled by a comet tail visible by phase - contrast microscopy ( Fig . 1A ) . HeLa - cell extracts contained 2 µ M endogenous T - plastin as determined by immunoblotting with T - plastin - speciﬁc antibodies . Supplementing extracts with exogenous recombinant T - plastin in the range 0 . 5 - 2 . 2 µ M caused a prominent densiﬁcation of the actin tails ( Fig . 1A ) and an increase in the proportion of comet formation from 50 % to 80 % . Densiﬁcation of actin tails occurred concomitantly with tail growth and was also observed at high T - plastin concentrations ( Fig . 1A ) . The densiﬁcation of the comets was not due to an increase of the medium viscosity , as described by Wiesner et al . ( Wiesner et al . , 2003 ) . Indeed , Fig . 1 . T - Plastin affects the movement of VCA beads in a dose - dependent manner . ( A ) Time - lapse phase - contrast microscopy of bead movement . Beads were incubated in HeLa - cell extracts in the absence ( control , left ) or presence ( 1 . 1 µ M , middle , and 2 . 2 µ M , right ) of endogenous T - plastin , observed from 3 minutes to 7 minutes ( top to bottom ) . Little depolymerization of the actin tail is observed when T - plastin is added ( black arrow ) . ( B ) Bead velocity as a function of T - plastin concentration . Bead velocity shows a bell - shaped dependence on T - plastin concentration with a maximum velocity at 1 . 1 µ M T - plastin . Each bar represents the mean±s . d . of 20 measurements . An asterisk ( * ) indicates results that differ signiﬁcantly from the results obtained with the addition of 1 . 1 µ M T - plastin ( P < 0 . 0001 ) . J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e 1258 by Brownian - motion analysis , we found that the diffusion coefficient of 1 µ m diameter bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) coated beads placed in extracts was not affected by the presence of T - plastin , the viscosity being 3 × 10 – 3 ±1 × 10 – 3 kg m – 1 second – 1 in all cases . In the absence of exogenous T - plastin , the mean length of actin tails was 4 . 0±1 . 5 µ m . Tail length was signiﬁcantly increased to 7 . 2±2 . 1 µ m by the addition of 1 . 1 µ M T - plastin . The length of actin tails being deﬁned by the balance of cycles of actin assembly and disassembly , this result suggested that T - plastin affected actin - ﬁlament turnover and , as a consequence , the rate of bead movement . To test this hypothesis , we measured bead velocity in the absence ( control ) or presence of exogenous T - plastin at various concentrations ( Fig . 1B ) . VCA - coated control beads moved with a maximum velocity of 1 . 9 µ m minute – 1 , comparable to that obtained in previous studies ( Bernheim - Groswasser et al . , 2002 ; Wiesner et al . , 2003 ) . Plotting bead velocity as a function of T - plastin concentration yielded a bell - shaped curve . At a concentration of 0 . 5 - 1 . 1 µ M , exogenous T - plastin increased the velocity up to 1 . 5 times ( Fig . 1B ) . At higher concentrations ( up to 2 . 3 µ M ) , velocity decreased to a value similar to that of control beads . Such a behavior might result from changing the balances of different aspects of actin dynamics ( e . g . F - actin stabilization versus turnover ) . T - Plastin might regulate actin organization and dynamics by cross - linking actin ﬁlaments into tight unipolar bundles . To assess whether this activity of T - plastin contributed to the modiﬁcation of comet structure and bead movement , we generated a bundling - incompetent variant comprising the N - terminal calmodulin - like Ca 2 + - binding domain followed by the ﬁrst actin - binding domain ( Fig . 2A ) . This variant , named ABD1 , bound F - actin like T - plastin , as shown in a high - speed F - actin cosedimentation assay ( Fig . 2B , top ) but did not , as expected , bundle actin ﬁlaments as shown by low - speed cosedimentation , which sedimented F - actin bundles but not simple actin ﬁlaments ( Fig . 2B , bottom ) . Importantly , when tested in the bead assay , similar effects on bead velocity , comet length and density were observed with ABD1 ( Fig . 2C , D ) as with T - plastin ( Fig . 1A , B ) . Surprisingly , ABD1 still densiﬁed and stabilized actin comets ( Fig . 2C ) . Furthermore , as for T - plastin , bead velocity varied following a bell - shaped curve for ABD1 concentrations in the range 0 - 2 . 2 µ M ( Fig . 2D ) . No signiﬁcant difference was detected between T - plastin and ABD1 results , as evidenced by Student’s t test P values of 0 . 052 and 0 . 63 at 1 . 1 µ M and 2 . 2 µ M , respectively . This result clearly showed that the effects of T - plastin on actin - based movement and comet organization were independent of its bundling activity . Therefore , binding of T - plastin to the sides of actin ﬁlaments must be sufficient to cause these structural and dynamic modiﬁcations . To verify that T - plastin and ABD1 indeed acted through their association with the comet actin cytoskeleton , we examined the distribution of actin , T - plastin and ABD1 in the actin comet tails by epiﬂuorescence microscopy . Exogenous T - plastin and ABD1 localized throughout the comet , as did endogenous T - plastin ( Fig . 3A , left ) . To correlate actin density to amounts of T - plastin or ABD1 bound to actin comets , ﬂuorescence signals were integrated . Fluorescence intensities were measured close to the bead surface where actin polymerization occurs . ABD1 intensity was on average twofold higher than that of exogenous T - plastin , suggesting that more of this plastin variant bound to comet tails ( Fig . 3A , right ) . This difference might be explained by the fact that , at saturating conditions , ABD1 binds pure F - actin with a higher stoichiometry ( 1 : 1 ) than T - plastin ( 1 : 3 ) in vitro ( Glenney et al . , 1981b ; Hanein et al . , 1998 ) . Correlated to the increase in T - plastin or ABD1 Journal of Cell Science 118 ( 6 ) Fig . 2 . The ﬁrst actin - binding domain of T - plastin ( ABD1 ) , which binds but does not bundle actin ﬁlaments , has a similar effect on bead movement to wild - type T - plastin .

G - Actin was polymerized in the presence of T - plastin ( + T - plastin ) or ABD1 ( + ABD1 ) , or their absence ( control ) . The molar ratio of actin : plastin or actin : ABD1 was 4 : 1 . Proteins were centrifuged at high speed to sediment actin ﬁlaments ( top ) or at low speed to sediment actin bundles ( bottom ) . Proteins in supernatants ( S ) and pellets ( P ) were separated by SDS - PAGE under reducing conditions . Protein bands were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue . ( C ) Time - lapse phase - contrast microscopy of bead movement . Beads were incubated in HeLa extracts supplemented with 1 . 1 µ M or 2 . 2 µ M ABD1 . No depolymerization of the actin tail is observed when ABD1 is added ( black arrow ) . ( D ) Bead velocity as a function of ABD1 concentration Bead velocity shows a bell - shaped dependence on ABD1 concentration , with a maximum velocity for 1 . 1 µ M ABD1 . Each bar represents the mean±s . d . of ten measurements . An asterisk ( * ) indicates results that differ signiﬁcantly from the result obtained with the addition of 1 . 1 µ M ABD1 ( P < 0 . 0006 ) . J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e 1259 T - Plastin - dependent force generation ﬂuorescence intensity , a moderate but signiﬁcant increase in rhodamine - actin ﬂuorescence intensity was observed close to the bead surface where actin assembly occurs ( Fig . 3A , right ) . Because bundling seemed not to be important for the densiﬁcation and elongation of comets , we looked for another mechanism by which T - plastin could affect actin dynamics . Comets in the presence of 2 . 2 µ M T - plastin or ABD1 were on average 25 % longer than those of control VCA beads moving at the same rate , indicating differences in depolymerization and directing us to ADF / coﬁlin as a candidate target for T - plastin action . ADF / coﬁlin family members control cellular actin dynamics by enhancing the off rate from the pointed end of actin ﬁlaments ( Carlier et al . , 1997 ) or by severing actin ﬁlaments ( Maciver et al . , 1991 ) and creating new barbed Fig . 3 . T - Plastin and ABD1 increase in actin tails concomitant with a signiﬁcant increase in actin content and partial displacement of coﬁlin . ( A ) Quantiﬁcation of actin and T - plastin or ABD1 in actin comets . Beads were incubated in HeLa - cell extracts supplemented with 1 µ M Alexa - 568 - labeled actin in the presence of 1 . 1 µ M T - plastin ( middle ) or ABD1 ( bottom ) , or their absence ( control , top ) ; actin is shown on the left . Samples were immunostained with anti - plastin primary antibody and Alexa - 488 - coupled secondary antibody ( right ) .

Asterisks ( * * ) indicate results that differ signiﬁcantly from the results obtained with the control ( * , P < 0 . 0031 ; * * , P < 0 . 0063 ) . ( B ) Quantiﬁcation of coﬁlin / actin ratio in actin comets . Beads were incubated in extracts and processed as described in A , with the exception that anti - coﬁlin antibody was used for staining ( middle ) . Representative ﬂuorescence images are shown . Graphs indicate the ratios of the integrated ﬂuorescence intensities of coﬁlin / actin in the comets , measured at 2 µ m distance from the bead . J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e 1260 ﬁlaments ends ( Ghosh et al . , 2004 ) . As visualized by immunoﬂuorescence staining , coﬁlin distributed throughout the actin tail in control samples and in the presence of T - plastin or ABD1 ( Fig . 3B , left ) . Measurement of ratios of actin to coﬁlin ﬂuorescence intensities revealed that T - plastin and ABD1 partially displaced coﬁlin from comets ( Fig . 3B , right ) . Considering that coﬁlin depolymerizes F - actin , its displacement might contribute to the elongation and densiﬁcation of actin comets , as observed in a similar assay ( Rosenblatt et al . , 1997 ) . Taken together , these results suggested that T - plastin and ABD1 prevented actin ﬁlaments from disassembly . To examine further how T - plastin and ABD1 might stabilize F - actin , we analysed their effects on the in vitro depolymerization kinetics of pyrene - labeled F - actin diluted to a concentration below the critical concentration of the ﬁlament minus end ( 400 nM ) , in the absence or presence of 500 nM GST - coﬁlin ( Fig . 4 ) . As expected , ﬂuorescence intensity decreased in function of time when pyrene - labeled F - actin was diluted in F - buffer . By contrast , no such decrease was observed when we diluted T - plastin / F - actin ﬁlaments , suggesting that T - plastin stabilized actin ﬁlaments ( Fig . 4A ) . A similar result was observed with ABD1 ( Fig . 4B ) , although at higher ABD1 to F - actin ratios . This suggested that binding of ABD1 stabilized actin ﬁlaments independent of cross - link formation and is in agreement with the increased length of actin comets that we described above . When F - actin ﬁlaments were diluted in F - buffer containing GST - coﬁlin , these ﬁlaments rapidly depolymerized ( Fig . 4C ) . GST alone , used as control , had no effect on depolymerization kinetics ( data not shown ) . Almost no decrease in ﬂuorescence intensity was observed when actin co - polymerized with T - plastin ( 1 : 1 ) was diluted in the presence of GST - coﬁlin . Similarly , ABD1 also protected actin ﬁlaments against GST - coﬁlin - induced depolymerization , but at higher ratios of ABD1 to GST - coﬁlin ( Fig . 4D ) ; indeed , compared with full - length T - plastin , four times more ABD1 was needed to inhibit Journal of Cell Science 118 ( 6 ) 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 0 100 200 300 400 Time ( sec ) ) % ( y t i s ne t n i e c ne cs e r ou l f e v i t a l e R Actin Actin / ABD1 ( 1 : 1 ) Actin / ABD1 ( 1 : 2 ) Actin / ABD1 ( 1 : 4 ) 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 0 100 200 300 400 Time ( sec ) ) % ( y t i s ne t n i e c ne cs e r ou l f e v i t a l e R Actin Actin / T - plastin ( 1 : 1 ) 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 0 100 200 300 400 Time ( sec ) ) % ( y t i s ne t n i e c ne cs e r ou l f e v i t a l e R Actin Actin + GST - cofilin Actin / ABD1 ( 1 : 2 ) Actin / ABD1 ( 1 : 2 ) + GST - cofilin Actin / ABD1 ( 1 : 4 ) Actin / ABD1 ( 1 : 4 ) + GST - cofilin 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 0 100 200 300 400 Time ( sec ) ) % ( y t i s ne t n i e c ne cs e r ou l f e v i t a l e R Actin Actin + GST - cofilin Actin / T - plastin ( 1 : 1 ) Actin / T - plastin ( 1 : 1 ) + GST - cofilin A B C D Fig . 4 . T - plastin or ABD1 stabilize actin ﬁlaments and protect them against coﬁlin - mediated depolymerization . G - Actin ( 4 µ M , 25 % pyrene labeled ) was co - polymerized with various concentrations of T - plastin or ABD1 . To induce depolymerization , T - plastin - or ABD1 - decorated pyrene - labeled - F - actin was diluted under the critical concentration of the ﬁlament minus ( – ) end . Depolymerization of F - actin as a function of time was measured as a decrease in ﬂuorescence because of the rapid depolymerization of actin ﬁlaments from their pointed ends . The ﬂuorescence scale was adjusted so that the ﬂuorescence of F - actin was 100 and that of G - actin was 0 . ( A ) F - Actin ( 4 µ M ) co - polymerized with T - plastin ( actin : T - plastin ratio of 1 : 1 ) was diluted to a concentration of 400 nM . Control ( actin ) was the depolymerization of F - actin in the absence of protein addition . ( B ) F - Actin decorated with ABD1 ( actin : ABD1 ratios of 1 : 1 , 1 : 2 or 1 : 4 ) was diluted to a concentration of 400 nM .

These results conﬁrmed the F - actin - stabilizing capacity of T - plastin and ABD1 . It is documented that physiological Ca 2 + concentrations ( 1 - 2 µ M ) inhibit the F - actin binding of L - plastin ( Namba et al . , 1992 ; Pacaud and Derancourt , 1993 ) , raising the possibility that the stabilizing effects we observed with T - plastin were also Ca 2 + - dependent . Because cell extracts contain other Ca 2 + - regulated proteins like gelsolin that might also contribute to actin turnover in comets ( Samarin et al . , 2003 ) , we decided to examine the effect of Ca 2 + in the F - actin depolymerization assay ( Fig . 5 ) . Importantly , when F - actin was co - polymerized with T - plastin in the presence of free Ca 2 + concentrations ranging from 4 . 6 nM to 1 . 6 µ M , almost identical depolymerization curves were obtained ( Fig . 5A ) . Next , we veriﬁed that T - plastin indeed bound F - actin in the presence of Ca 2 + using an F - actin co - sedimentation assay . Free Ca 2 + concentrations up to 2 . 2 µ M did not affect the binding of T - plastin to F - actin ( Fig . 5B ) . Conversely , F - actin binding of the closely related L - plastin isoform was Ca 2 + sensitive when analysed under identical experimental conditions ( data not shown ) , as observed previously ( Namba et al . , 1992 ; Pacaud and Derancourt , 1993 ) . This result conﬁrmed the observation that plastins differ in their Ca 2 + regulation , as previously proposed ( de Arruda et al . , 1990 ; Lin et al . , 1994 ) . To examine whether other F - actin - binding domains also stabilized and elongated actin comets , we analysed the effects of the C - terminal F - actin domain of the F - actin - bundling protein villin ( Friederich et al . , 1992 ) in our bead assay . This 67 - residue - long domain , called the headpiece , binds F - actin but does not bundle ﬁlaments ( Glenney et al . , 1981a ) . In addition , it was previously shown to compete with ADF , a coﬁlin family member , for binding to actin ﬁlaments using a F - actin co - sedimentation assay ( Pope et al . , 1994 ) . Accordingly , we found using a similar assay that also coﬁlin interfered with binding of villin headpiece to F - actin ( data not shown ) . As observed with ABD1 , addition of villin headpiece ( 1 µ M ) to cell extracts that do not contain villin ( Fig . 6 ) caused an approximately doubled actin comet length ( 6 . 70±2 . 05 µ m ) compared with control beads ( 3 . 89±0 . 94 µ m ) . Addition of BSA ( 1 µ M ) , an unrelated protein that does not bind actin , did not induce elongation of actin comets ( 3 . 53±0 . 74 µ m ) , showing that the phenotype observed with villin headpiece was speciﬁc . These results suggest that structurally distinct F - actin binding domains might share common properties , contributing to the control of actin turnover . The bead assay enabled us to reveal an unexpected property of ABD1 in comet tail stabilization . To corroborate this result , we analysed the effects of ABD1 in the more complex environment of a living cell ( Fig . 7 ) . Fibroblast - like Vero cells were transfected with a DNA construct encoding vsv - tagged ABD1 . Overexpression of ABD1 caused the formation of long , Fig . 6 . The C - terminal F - actin - binding domain of villin causes the elongation and densiﬁcation of F - actin comets . Beads were incubated in HeLa - cell extracts in the presence of villin headpiece domain ( VHP , 1 µ M ) or its absence ( control ) . Phase - contrast images are shown . Fig . 5 . Wild - type T - plastin stabilizes actin ﬁlaments in a Ca 2 + - independent manner . ( A ) Depolymerization of T - plastin - decorated pyrene - labeled F - actin in the presence of increasing free Ca 2 + concentrations . G - Actin ( 4 µ M , 25 % pyrene labeled ) was co - polymerized with T - plastin ( 4 µ M ) in the presence of increasing concentrations of free Ca 2 + ( 4 . 6 nM to 1 . 6 µ M ) . F - Actin was diluted and depolymerization was measured as described in Fig . 4 . Control ( actin ) was the depolymerization of F - actin in the absence of T - plastin . ( B ) Cosedimentation of T - plastin with F - actin in the presence of increasing free Ca 2 + concentrations . G - Actin ( 7 µ M ) was co - polymerized with T - plastin ( 3 µ M ) in the presence of increasing concentrations of free Ca 2 + . Proteins were centrifuged at high speed to sediment actin ﬁlaments . Proteins in supernatants ( S ) and pellets ( P ) were separated by SDS - PAGE under reducing conditions . Protein bands were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue . The migration positions of plastin and actin are indicated . Notice that , owing to the presence of Ca 2 + , more actin is present in the supernatant than observed in the experiment in Fig . 2 . J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e 1262 prominent actin cables spanning the cell body and peripheral , actin - rich membrane extensions that were not observed in neighboring ( Fig . 7A , 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 ) . Co - staining of cells for α - actinin ( Fig . 7A , 3 ) or VASP ( Fig . 7A , 6 ) , two proteins that contribute to the assembly and stability of actin networks , showed that they were recruited to these structures . As reported in previous studies ( Ichetovkin et al . , 2002 ) , coﬁlin antibody yielded a diffuse staining pattern that did not co - distribute with the actin cables , even in untransfected control cells ( data not shown ) . In agreement with a stabilizing effect , ABD1 - induced cables were more resistant to latrunculin A , an F - actin depolymerizing drug that sequesters actin monomers ( Spector et al . , 1989 ) , than those of neighboring untransfected cells ( Fig . 7B , 1 , 2 ) . These results conﬁrmed that ABD1 reorganizes and stabilizes F - actin under cellular conditions and suggested that it might act in synergy with other actin - regulating proteins . Accordingly , measuring the α - actinin to actin ratios of ﬂuorescence intensities in the bead assay showed that signiﬁcantly more α - actinin ( α - actinin / actin ratio of 1 . 4 ) was recruited to the actin comets in cell extracts supplemented with ABD1 ( 1 µ M ) compared with control to extracts ( α - actinin / actin ratio of 1 . 09 ) . Discussion We used a simpliﬁed , quantitative cell - free assay for actin - based motility to gain new insights into the mechanism by which T - plastin , a representative CH - domain actin - bundling protein , might contribute to actin - based force generation and actin assembly . In our cell - free motility assay , T - plastin enhanced comet formation , stabilized the comets and increased bead velocity . Importantly , these effects were also observed with the bundling - incompetent ABD1 variant , arguing for a mechanism independent of actin - ﬁlament bundling . Also in line with the stabilization effect , we found that T - plastin and ABD1 protected ﬁlaments from coﬁlin - mediated depolymerization in vitro . Taken together , these ﬁndings give , to our knowledge , the ﬁrst direct evidence that T - plastin can modulate actin dynamics and generate force independent of cross - bridge formation in a WASP - Arp2 / 3 - dependent polymerization system , a mechanism that might be applicable to other F - actin - stabilizing and / or bundling proteins , as suggested by our results with villin headpiece domain . How do T - plastin and ABD1 stabilize actin comets and increase bead velocity ? Actin - cross - linking proteins were generally thought to generate force by organizing actin ﬁlaments into bundles ( Loomis et al . , 2003 ; Vignjevic et al . , 2003 ) . Although ﬁlament cross - linking activity is obviously required for their biological function in microvillus formation ( Friederich et al . , 1989 ; Loomis et al . , 2003 ) , our results indicate that this might be only part of the activity of T - plastin . Our assays allowed us to separate the effects of F - actin bundling and binding of T - plastin . ABD1 stabilized actin comets and induced their elongation and densiﬁcation , as did wild - type T - plastin . The in - vitro F - actin depolymerization assay showed that both T - plastin and ABD1 stabilized actin ﬁlaments , protecting them from depolymerization . Based on our ﬁndings , at least two mutually non - exclusive and potentially synergistic mechanisms might account for these effects . ABD1 might stabilize actin ﬁlaments by binding along the side of the actin ﬁlament ( Hanein et al . , 1997 ) , thereby affecting its dynamics . Consistently , ABD1 of the closely related L - plastin isoform also inhibited F - actin depolymerization ( Lebart et al . , 2004 ) . In addition , ABD1 might protect actin ﬁlaments against the depolymerizing action of coﬁlin , a protein that controls actin turnover ( Carlier et al . , 2003 ; Pollard and Borisy , 2003 ) and polymerization by generating free barbed ends ( Ghosh et al . , 2004 ) . In agreement with such a mechanism , yeast plastin also Journal of Cell Science 118 ( 6 ) Fig . 7 . ABD1 stabilizes F - actin structures in transfected cells . ( A ) ABD1 induces the formation of long actin cables in cells to which the actin - binding proteins α - actinin and VASP are recruited . Transfected Vero cells transiently expressing epitope - tagged ABD1 - vsv were processed for triple staining with Alexa - 320 / phalloidin as a probe for F - actin ( left ) , anti - vsv tag primary antibody and Cy2 - coupled secondary antibody for immunoﬂuorescence staining of ABD1 - vsv ( middle ) , anti - α - actinin antibody and Texas - Red - coupled secondary antibody ( right , top ) or anti - VASP antibody and Texas - Red - coupled secondary antibody ( right , bottom ) .

( B ) F - Actin cables induced by ABD1 are more resistant to latrunculin - A treatment than those of non - transfected cells . Transfected Vero cells were treated with 100 nM latrunculin A for 60 minutes and double stained for F - actin ( left ) and vsv - tag ( right ) . Bar , 15 µ m . Notice that the actin cytoskeleton of untransfected cells ( arrows ) is disrupted compared with that of cells expressing ABD1 . J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e 1263 T - Plastin - dependent force generation stabilized F - actin structures by displacing coﬁlin ( Nakano et al . , 2001 ) . Whether T - plastin and coﬁlin compete for binding to the same site on the actin ﬁlament or might indirectly inﬂuence their binding by inducing a conformational change in the actin subunit , as supported by structural and biochemical data ( Hanein et al . , 1998 ; McGough et al . , 1997 ) , remains to be experimentally evaluated . Our data do not exclude the possibility that T - plastin also protects actin ﬁlaments from depolymerization caused by other proteins , as suggested by the observation that plant plastin inhibits proﬁlin - induced actin disassembly ( Kovar et al . , 2000 ) . The rate of actin - based movement is correlated with the rate of actin polymerization ( Theriot et al . , 1992 ) . Consistently , we observed a small but signiﬁcant increase in rhodamine - actin close to the bead surface , where actin assembles ( Bernheim - Groswasser et al . , 2002 ) , and a 1 . 5 - times increase in bead velocity . Notably , T - plastin or ABD1 were previously shown to bind more efficiently to F - actin when present during polymerization ( Hanein et al . , 1997 ) , suggesting that these proteins might be incorporated into actin ﬁlaments as soon as they are nucleated at the bead surface . Because T - plastin does not affect the polymerization kinetics of pure actin in vitro ( data not shown ) , it is unlikely that this protein increases the rate of actin polymerization by keeping Arp2 / 3 - nucleated ﬁlaments uncapped or by nucleating new free barbed ends . Considering the newly discovered biochemical property of T - plastin ( or ABD1 ) , it might act through this stabilizing effect and inﬂuence the elongation phase of actin ﬁlaments nucleated by Arp2 / 3 or generated by coﬁlin - mediated severing . In line with this , a recent study using a semi - in - vitro Listeria - based motility assay showed that , when Arp2 / 3 activity is inhibited after nucleation , cross - linking proteins are absolutely required for ﬁlament elongation and bacterial movement ( Brieher et al . , 2004 ) . Stabilizing the capped actin ﬁlaments that are distributed throughout the comet , T - plastin or ABD1 might consequently prevent actin depolymerization , causing the densiﬁcation and lengthening of the comet . ABD1 does not cross - link actin ﬁlaments but does induce the formation of dense actin comets in the bead assay and straight actin cables in cells . α - Actinin and VASP , proteins that control actin organization and assembly ( Pavalko and Burridge , 1991 ; Sechi and Wehland , 2004 ) , were recruited to these structures , suggesting that ABD1 might cooperate rather than compete with these proteins . Conceivably , cell extracts might contain additional factors acting in synergy with T - plastin , as suggested by our results , or increasing its activity , as shown in other cell - based studies ( Galkin et al . , 2002 ; Ohsawa et al . , 2004 ) . This might also explain why α - actinin , a plastin - related protein , did not affect the velocity of the Listeria bacteria in a cell - free motility assay based on a minimal set of puriﬁed proteins required for actin - based movement ( Loisel et al . , 1999 ) . Taken together , these ﬁndings support the view that the balance of the antagonist F - actin - stabilizing effect of T - plastin or ABD1 and the destabilizing activity of coﬁlin are important for the assembly and turnover of F - actin structures , as also highlighted in a study addressing the antagonist activities of coﬁlin and tropomyosin homologs in Caenorhabditis elegans ( Ono and Ono , 2002 ) . Recently , it was shown that coﬁlin not only depolymerizes actin but also generates free barbed ends by severing actin ﬁlaments ( Ghosh et al . , 2004 ) . Although stabilization of short - lived actin ﬁlaments by T - plastin or ABD1 might increase force , large amounts of these proteins might impede actin turnover , yielding the opposite effect . This might explain why a bell - shaped curve was obtained when bead velocity was measured as a function of T - plastin or ABD1 concentrations . Consistently , other proteins that regulate actin dynamics ( including VASP , proﬁlin , or Arp2 / 3 ) yielded a dose - dependent , bell - shaped velocity curve in a similar cell - free motility assay measuring the rate of Listeria movement ( Loisel et al . , 1999 ) . Our observation that the C - terminal headpiece domain of villin also increased the length of actin comets suggests that the stabilizing effects observed with ABD1 might be a more general property of F - actin - binding domains . Both domains inﬂuence F - actin dynamics and interfere with binding of coﬁlin ( Pope et al . , 1994 ) . However , the small villin domain did not prevent ﬁlament disassembly in the F - actin depolymerization assay ( data not shown ) . Thus , this domain might stabilize actin ﬁlaments less efficiently than ABD1 . The F - actin - stabilizing capacity of these actin - binding domains might depend on their contact interfaces with adjacent subunits of the actin ﬁlament ( Hanein et al . , 1998 ; Van Troys et al . , 1999 ) . However , the precise mechanism by which these domains regulate actin dynamics remains to be elucidated . What might be the functions of T - plastin in vivo ? Our ﬁndings support the view that T - plastin contributes to protrusive force generation in two ways – by cross - link formation and by ﬁlament stabilization . This is in agreement with the observation that overexpression of these protein in cultured epithelial cells can cause the elongation of microvilli ( Arpin et al . , 1994 ) . In line with a role in the biogenesis of membrane protrusions , T - plastin associates with the developing actin cytoskeleton of embryonic intestinal microvilli ( Chafel et al . , 1995 ) and stereocilia of the inner ear ( Daudet and Lebart , 2002 ) . Based on our data , T - plastin might control actin turnover and the length of the actin ﬁlaments in these structures , which is crucial for their biological function ( Schneider et al . , 2002 ) . T - Plastin is associated not only with the F - actin bundle of epithelial cell microvilli but also with the leading edge of migrating ﬁbroblasts ( Arpin et al . , 1994 ) , which contains a branched network of ﬁlaments ( Svitkina and Borisy , 1999 ) that this protein might stabilize . In line with this , yeast plastin is required for the stabilization of Arp2 / 3 - dependent branched network of ﬁlaments in actin patches ( Young et al . , 2004 ) . Taken together , our work suggests that T - plastin causes the reorganization and elongation of an actin structure initiated by the WASP - Arp2 / 3 complex polymerization unit , and concomitantly increase actin - based force . This provides a framework in which we can further elucidate the function of cross - linking proteins in the morphogenesis of membrane protrusions . We thank M .
