Auxilin , a Newly Identified Clathrin - associated Protein in Coated Vesicles from Bovine Brain Susanne Ahle and Ernst Ungewickell Max - Planck Institut fiir Biochemie , D - 8033 Martinsried bei M / inchen , FRG Abstract . We have identified a new coat protein in clathrin - coated vesicles from bovine brain by urea - SDS gel electrophoresis . The protein was purified from Tris - solubilized coat proteins either by combina - tion of hydroxyapatite chromatography and gel filtra - tion or more rapidly in a single step by im - munoaffinity chromatography . The purified protein binds to clathrin triskelia and thereby promotes clathrin assembly into regular 50 - 100 - nm cages . We propose for the new protein the name auxilin ( Latin auxilium , meaning support ) . Auxilin migrates as a l l0 - kD polypeptide in standard type SDS - PAGE , but in the presence of 6 M urea shifts to a position corre - sponding to 126 kD . Gel filtration in 6 M guani - dinium hydrochloride gives a molecular weight of ' ~ 86 , 000 . The native protein is monomeric in 0 : 5 M Tris . Antigenic reactivity and two - dimensional peptide maps gave no evidence of gross similarities between auxilin and any of the other known coated vesicle - associated proteins . Since the structural organization of auxilin does not resemble that of the ubiquitous heterotetrameric HA1 and HA2 adaptor complexes , that are believed to connect clathrin to receptors , it is unlikely that it functions as an adaptor . Immunoblot - ting did not reveal the presence of auxilin in tissues other than brain . If auxilin and AP 180 are indeed both confined to neuronal cells , as the immunochemi - cal evidence suggests , it might be inferred that both serve to adapt clathrin - coated vesicles to an as yet un - disclosed function unique to this cell type . C LATHRIN - COATED pits and vesicles are known to par - ticipate in intracellular transport processes such as receptor - mediated endocytosis and in directing lyso - somal enzyme receptors from the trans - Golgi network to a prelysosomal compartment ( for review , see references 7 , 21 , and 23 ) . One strategy employed for investigating the details of coated vesicle function consists in the identification , puri - fication , and biochemical characterization of coated vesicle components . This approach has led to detailed insight into the structure and properties of the major coat protein clath - rin , which self - assembles to form the polygonal framework of coated membranes ( 12 , 20 , 34 ) . The interaction between clathrin and receptors in the membrane requires the pres - ence of tetrameric protein complexes ( 33 , 36 ) , which have recently been termed adaptors ( 22 ) . Two such adaptor com - plexes , HA1 and HA2 , have been identified in bovine brain ( 24 ; for different nomenclatures see reference 10 ) . The HAl adaptor consists of / 3 ' , 3 ' , 47 , and 20 - kD subunits , and adapts clathrin to receptors in the trans - Golgi network , whereas the HA2 complex , which is made up of or , / 3 , 50 , and 16 - kD sub - units , attaches it to receptors in the plasma membrane ( 3 , 27 ) . The / 3 subunit , which is closely related to the / 3 ' subunit of the HA1 adaptor , was recently shown to bind to clathrin , while the other adaptor - specific subunits were conjectured to interact with membranes ( 1 ) . Moreover , direct interac - tions between the HA1 and HA2 adaptors and certain cyto - plasmic receptor tails have been demonstrated in vitro ( 6 , 22 ) . The protein coat of coated vesicles from bovine brain additionally contain in their coat besides the adaptor com - plexes the protein AP 180 ( Assembly Protein 180 ) ( 2 , 25 ) also referred to as AP3 ( 10 ) . This protein was shown to in - duce in vitro assembly of clathrin under conditions close to physiological when it does not polymerize by itself . Al - though it has been claimed that AP 180 binds to coated vesi - cle membranes ( 25 ) , it seems unlikely to represent a third class of adaptor protein , because its structural organization bears no relationship to the known adaptor complexes . Here , we report the discovery of a new coat - associated protein with clathrin assembly promoting properties . In rec - ognition of this property , we propose the name auxilin for the new protein , derived from the Latin auxilium , meaning support or help . Auxilin , an 86 , 000 - D protein has probably escaped previous detection , because it behaves anomalously in standard SDS - PAGE and is therefore not readily resolved from the / 3 ' subunit of the HAl adaptor . Auxilin is not related to any of the known coat - associated proteins , but in its main structural features it resembles the protein AP 180 more than the adaptor complexes .

Methods Purification of Auxilin . Coated vesicles from bovine brain tissue were pre - pared according to Campbell et al . ( 4 ) . For the purification of auxilin by conventional biochemical techniques , 60 mg total coat protein was ex - tracted with 0 . 5 M Tris ( pH 7 . 0 ) , containing 0 . 1 mM PMSF , 2 mM EDTA , and 1 mM DTT ( 11 ) . To obtain the assembly protein fraction , the extract was clarified by ultracentrifugation and then subjected to gel filtration ex - actly as described elsewhere ( 1 ) . The assembly proteins ( , ~ 12 mg ) were then fractionated on hydroxyapatite exactly as described by Ahle and Ungewick - ell ( 1 ) . Auxilin desorbed between 0 . 10 and 0 . 15 M phosphate . The major contaminant at this stage was AP 180 . Fractions that contained auxilin were pooled , concentrated by centrifugation in a Centricon 30 microconcentra - tor , and then subjected in two to three batches to gel filtration on a 10 x 300 - mm Superose 6 gel filtration column . This procedure yielded , ~ 200 # g auxilin . Alternatively , the protein was purified by immunoaffinity chromatogra - phy with the auxilin - directed mAb 100 / 4 . 40 ml of a crude membrane frac - tion ( pellets from the first nitracentrifugation in the standard coated vesicle preparation of Pearse ( 20 ) was diluted to 50 ml with 0 . 1 M MES , 0 . 5 mM MgCI2 , 1 mM EGTA , 0 . 02 % NaN3 ( pH 6 . 5 ) , and then extracted with an equal volume of 1 M Tris ( pH 7 . 0 ) , 2 mM EDTA , 0 . 1 mM PMSF at 4°C . Insoluble material was removed by ultracentrifugation for 60 min at 100 , 000 g . The supernatant was passed through a column containing 12 mg of mAb 100 / 4 coupled to 4 ml Sepharose 4B at a flow rate of I0 ml / h . The column was successively washed with 20 ml of 0 . 5 M Tris ( pH 7 . 0 ) ( Tris - buffer ) , 20 ml of 50 mM " Iris ( pH 8 . 0 ) , 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 , and 20 ml of 50 mM Tris ( pH 8 . 0 ) . The resin was then removed from the column , washed with 5 vol Tris - buffer , and recovered by low speed centrifugation . This procedure was repeated twice before the resin was returned to the column . Auxilin was eluted with 3 . 5 M MgCI2 at room temperature and immediately desalted on a PD10 ( Pharmacia Fine Chemicals , Uppsala , Sweden ) G25 gel filtration column . The PD 10 column was equilibrated in 2 mM Tris , 50 mM NaCl , 0 . 5 mM EDTA ( pH 8 . 0 ) , 1 mg of auxilin resulted from 40 ml crude mem - branes , corresponding to , ' v24 mg of total protein in the assembly protein fraction . The protein was stable at - 20°C in 50 % glycerol . Determination of Stokes Radius and Sedimentation Coe ~ icient . The Stokes radius of auxilin was determined by gel filtration on a 10 x 300 - ram Superose 12 column , equilibrated with 0 . 5 M Tris - HCl ( pH 7 . 0 ) , 2 mM EDTA , I mM DTT . The column was calibrated with apoferritin ( 64 / ~ ) , rab - bit immunoglobulin ( 55 / ~ ) , aldolase ( 45 / ~ ) , BSA ( 35 A ) , and ovalbumin ( 29 / ~ ) . The void volume was determined with intact clathrin cages that had been cross - linked with glutaraldehyde and the included volume with ATE The flow rate was 0 . 5 ml / min . Elution volumes of the marker proteins were determined by monitoring the eluate at 280 nm . To determine the elution volume of auxilin , 0 . 2 ml of total coat protein was applied to the column and 0 . 25 ml fractions were collected . Auxilin was detected by SDS - PAGE and immunoblotting . The Stokes radii were plotted against the inverse error function , erf - 1 ( 1 - Kd ) , yielding a linear calibration ( 17 ) . To determine the subunit molecular weight of auxilin total coat protein was denatured by dialysis against 6 M guanidinium chloride , 2 mM EDTA , 1 mM DTT , 20 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 8 . 0 ) , and then applied to a Superose 6 gel filtration column , equilibrated in the same solvent . The column was calibrated with myosin , thyroglobulin , ~ galactosidase , and rabbit immunoglobulins heavy and light chains . Elution volumes for the markers and auxilin were obtained as described above . The plot of Kd t / 3 versus mol wt 0555 yields a straight line from which the molecular weight of auxilin was obtained by interpola - tion ( 17 ) . The sedimentation coefficient of auxilin was determiried by sucrose den - sity gradient centrifugation in the presence of suitable marker proteins of known sedimentation coefficients according to the procedure of Siegel and Monty ( 32 ) . 0 . 5 ml of total coat protein was loaded together with myoglobin ( 2S ) , catalase ( 11 . 3S ) , aldolase ( 7 . 4S ) , BSA ( 4 . 6S ) , and clathrin ( 8 . 4S ) on a 4 . 5 - ml 5 - 20 % linear sucrose gradient . The gradient was centrifuged for 18 h at 45 , 000 rpm at 4°C in a rotor ( SW 60 ; Beckman Instrmnents , Palo Alto , CA ) . The tube was punctured and 0 . 175 - ml fractions were collected manually . The protein composition of each fraction was analyzed by SDS - PAGE and by immunoblotting . The molecular weight of auxilin was calculated from the equation : Mr = 61rNRsSao . J ( 1 - vO2O , w ) ; where Rs is the Stokes radius , $ 2o . ~ the corrected sedimentation coeffi - cient , and N the Avogadro number . The partial specific volume v of auxilin was taken to be 0 . 73 ml / g . Assembly Experiments . 50 # g clathrin triskelia were dialyzed overnight at 4°C either in the absence or presence of auxilin ( 17 and 34 ttg ) against 0 . 1 M MES , 1 mM EGTA , 0 . 5 mM MgC12 , pH 6 . 5 . The extent of assem - bly was analyzed by sucrose gradient centrifugation , using 4 . 5 ml gradients of 5 - 30 % sucrose made up in 0 . 1 M MES , 0 . 5 mM MgCl2 , 1 mM EGTA , 0 . 02 % NAN3 , pH 6 . 5 . The gradients were centrifuged for 1 h at 38 , 000 rpm in a rotor ( SW 60 ; Beckman Instruments ) at 4°C . Fractions of 0 . 33 ml were collected manually . The protein composition of each fraction was analyzed by SDS - PAGE , and the extent of assembly was quantified by densitometry of the clathrin zone . Aliquots of the dialysate were also negatively stained with uranyl acetate and viewed in a Zeiss EM 109 electron microscope . Binding to Preassembled Clathrin Cages . Clathrin triskelia were as - sembled into cages by dialysis against 0 . 1 M MES , 1 mM EGTA , 0 . 5 mM MgCl2 , 2 mM CaCI2 ( pH 6 . 5 ) , and then mildly cross - linked with 3 , 3 ' - dithiobis ( sulfosuccinimidylpropionate ) as described in reference 29 to pre - vent their disintegration upon dilution . Uuassembled clathrin was removed by ultracentrifugation . The pelleted cages ( preformed cages ) were resus - pended in 5 mM Hepes , 100 mM potassium tartrate , 0 . 5 mM EDTA , 0 . 25 mM MgCl2 , pH 7 . 2 ( binding buffer ) , and incubated on ice for 0 . 5 h with auxilin . In a typical binding experiment 1 . 3 - 8 / xg auxilin was incubated ei - ther alone , to test for aggregation of anxilin under binding conditions , or with 9 # g clathrin cages in a final volume of 0 . 13 ml binding buffer . The extent of binding was analyzed by ultracentrifugation for 15 rain at 45 , 000 rpm ( " 088 , 000 g ) in a centrifuge ( TL 100 , TLA 100 rotor ; Beckman Instru = ments ) . Pellets and supernatants were analyzed by SDS - PAGE and den - sitometry . Antibody Production . The mAb 100 / 4 used in this paper was obtained from a BALB / c mouse that was immunized three times at intervals of 2 wk with 20 t ~ g of total assembly protein . For three consecutive days before the day of the cell fusion , the mouse was boosted intravenously with 10 / zg as - sembly protein . The fusion routine and tissue culturing were executed ex - actly as described previously ( 3 ) . Supernatants were screened by immuno - blotting . Colonies of interest were subcloned twice by limited dilution . For large - scale production of monoclonal antibodies , hybridomas were cultured in roller bottles as described before ( 3 ) . Protein Concentrations . All concentrations were determined spec - trophotometrically . For clathrin , a specific absorbance at 280 run of Eicrnl = 11 . 9 waS USed . The concentration of auxilin was obtained from the absor - bance at 205 nm , taking E ( 1 mg / mi ; 1 cm ) = 31 ( reference 30 ) . The con - centrations obtained corresponded to a specific absorbance at 280 nm of Elcm l ~ t = 7 . 9 . Peptide Mapping . Two - dimensional peptide analysis of t25I - labeled tryptic peptides was performed essentially according to the procedure of Elder et al . ( 5 ) and as described in detail elsewhere ( 2 ) . Quantitative lmmunoprecipitation . 1 g of bovine brain was homoge - nized in 1 ml of 0 . 1 M MES , 0 . 5 mM MgCI2 , 1 mM EGTA , 0 . 02 % NaN3 ( pH 6 . 5 ) , and the suspension clarified by centrifugation for 0 . 5 h at 7 , 000 g . The supernatant was then centrifuged for 0 . 5 h at 100 , 000 g in an ultracen - trifuge ( TL 100 ; Beckman Instruments ) . The volumes of pellets and super - natants were first adjusted with 0 . 1 M MES , 0 . 5 mM MgCI2 , 1 mM EGTA , 0 . 02 % NaN3 ( pH 6 . 5 ) , to 1 ml , before 1 ml of I M Tris ( pH 7 . 0 ) , was added . Both samples were again ultracentrifuged as described above , and the super - natants , which contained soluble coat proteins were saved . Auxilin was quantitatively removed from the supernatants by a 2 - h incubation with 50 / ~ g of mAb 100 / 4 , coupled to a Sepharose matrix . After extensively washing the Sepharose with 0 . 5 M Tris ( pH 7 . 0 ) , and PBS , the amount of auxilin bound to the antibody and was quantified by SDS - PAGE . By immunoblot - ting , it was ascertained that all the auxilin present in the Tris - extracts was adsorbed by the antibody . Miscellaneous Techniques . Free flow electrophoresis of coated vesicles was performed essentially as described previously ( 18 ) . In brief , 10 - 20 - mg coated vesicles obtained by differential centrifugation according to Camp - bell et al .

Electrophoresis was performed in a Hoefer Mighty Small II unit . The gels were either stained with Coomas - sie brilliant blue or electroblotted onto nitrocellulose paper for probing with monoclonal antibodies .

Results Identification of a New Coated Vesicle Component Coat proteins were extracted from purified clathrin - coated vesicles with 0 . 5 M Tris and then subjected to gel filtration to separate clathrin from the adaptors and the assembly pro - tein AP 180 . When a pool of fractions , containing the HA1 and HA2 adaptor complexes , protein AP 180 and other mi - nor components ( previously described as assembly protein fraction [ 11 ] ) was analyzed by SDS - PAGE in the presence of 6 M urea , we noted a polypeptide of Mr ~ 126 , 000 , which was not resolved from other components in the 100 - 116 kD molecular mass range in the standard system of Laemmli 06 ) ( Fig . 1 ) . This polypeptide was not stained on immuno - blots by monoclonal antibodies directed against the previ - ously characterized subunits of the two adaptor complexes or against AP 180 ( 2 , 3 ) . However , our repertoire of mono - clonal antibodies that were elicited in mice by injection with total coat proteins , contained one antibody ( mAb 100 / 4 ) , which reacted exclusively with the new polypeptide ( Fig . 1 ; lanes 2 and 8 ) . Immunoblotting showed that this species mi - grates on standard SDS - PAGE in a position corresponding to Mr , x , 110 kD , which is very close to the / ~ and / 3 ' - type adaptor subunits . A major proteolytic fragment of AP 180 , which migrates close to the new polypeptide in urea - SDS - PAGE ( Fig . 1 , lane 6 ) does not accompany it in stan - dard SDS - PAGE ( Fig . 1 , lane 4 ) . To avoid ambiguity in designating the new protein in terms of an apparent molecu - lar mass , we shall henceforth refer to it as auxilin . To show that auxilin is a component of clathrin - coated vesicles and not a contaminant originating from unrelated membranes , we purified coated vesicles by differential cen - trifugation followed by free flow electrophoresis ( 18 ) . Frac - tions obtained from the latter were analyzed by urea - SDS - PAGE and immunoblotting with monoclonal antibodies against auxilin and against known constituents of clathrin - coated vesicles . The result shows that auxilin copurifies with clath - rin and with a light chain of clathrin ( LCD in free flow electrophoresis and is thus very likely to be associated with clathrin coated vesicles ( Fig . 2 ) . Purification of Auxilin We undertook the purification of auxilin , starting from the assembly protein fraction , initially by conventional chro - matographic methods such as hydroxyapatite chromatogra - phy and gel filtration . The fractions from the hydroxyapatite column were analyzed by urea - SDS - PAGE and the presence of auxilin was confirmed by immunoblotting . Auxilin de - sorbed from the column between 0 . 1 and 0 . 15 M phosphate together with AP 180 and traces of the HA1 adaptor ( Fig . 3 ) . Fractions containing auxilin were then chromatographed on a Superose 6 gel filtration column to remove AP 180 and other minor contaminants ( Fig . 4 ) . Although it proved possi - ble to remove AP 180 and other minor polypeptides from auxilin by gel filtration , the yield and purity of auxilin ob - tained in this way was generally less than satisfactory . At - tempts to purify auxilin by Mono Q ion exchange chroma - tography instead of gel filtration were frustrated by high losses of the protein and were therefore abandoned . We therefore explored the possibility of immunoadsorbing auxi : lin from the 0 . 5 M Tris extract of a crude membrane fraction . In pilot experiments , it was established that the mAb 100 / 4 binds strongly to auxilin in 0 . 5 M Tris and that this interac - tion was effectively dissociated by high concentrations of MgCI2 . > 70 % of the auxilin was eluted from the affinity Ahle and Ungewickell Clathrin - associated Proteins 23 on O c t obe r 20 , 2017 j c b . r up r e ss . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m Figure 6 . Auxilin - induced assembly of clathrin cages . 50 # g clathrin triskelia were dialyzed into 0 . 1 M MES , 0 . 5 mM MgCI2 , 1 mM EGTA , 0 . 02 % NAN3 , pH 6 . 5 , with 34 / ~ g auxilin , and in a control experiment , 50 # g clathrin was dialyzed in the absence of auxilin . To assess assembly , aliquots of the samples were sedimented through 5 - 30 % sucrose gradients . Fractions from the gradients were analyzed by electrophoresis in 10 % Laemmli - type polyacrylamide gels , which were stained for protein with Coomassie .

By this means , we usu - ally obtained , , ol mg auxilin from 40 - ml pelleted crude membranes , containing some 24 mg total assembly protein . Compared to the biochemical procedure described above , immunoaffinity purification yielded , 02 . 5 times more auxi - lin and was therefore routinely employed . In electrophoresis in standard SDS gels , the purified protein appears as a rela - tive broad zone , which may reflect some microheterogeneity ( Fig . 5 ) . The nature of this effect has not been further ex - plored . It may arise from proteolysis and / or posttranslational modifications . In addition , immunoblots almost always showed two to three satellite bands . Proteolysis of auxilin could be inhibited , but never completely eliminated by addition of protease inhibitors to the Tris - extraction buffer . Upon elu - tion of the auxilin from the affinity column , care was taken to reduce the high salt concentration rapidly by gel filtration . Auxilin could be stored in 50 % glycerol at - 20°C without any detectable loss of activity ( see below ) . Functional Characterization of Auxilin The definitive identification of auxilin as a structural compo - nent of the coated vesicle must rest on a demonstration of saturable binding to clathrin or one of its associated proteins . Binding of AP 180 and of the HA2 adaptor complex to clathrin triskelia induces their assembly into cagelike struc - tures . To investigate whether auxilin has similar properties , we dialyzed clathrin triskelia alone and in the presence of auxilin against a buffer known to support only assembly protein - dependent polymerization of clathrin . The dialyzed samples were briefly spun in a table top centrifuge to remove large aggregates and then fractionated by centrifugation on sucrose gradients . The distribution of clathrin and auxilin was determined by SDS - PAGE and densitometry . As ex - pected , in the absence of auxilin all of the clathrin remained unassembled in the top fractions of the sucrose gradient ( Fig . 6 b ) . However , upon addition of auxilin , up to 45 % of the The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 111 , 1990 24 on O c t obe r 20 , 2017 j c b . r up r e ss . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m Figure 7 . Electron microscopy of reassembled cages . Clathrin triskelia were assembled either in the presence of AP 180 ( a ) or of auxilin ( b ) . Note that auxilin - induced cages are less uniform in diameter . clathrin sedimented together with auxilin in the position ex - pected for clathrin cages ( Fig . 6 a ) . 31 % of the clathrin re - mained unassembled , while 24 % formed large aggregates that were pelleted by low speed centrifugation . 64 % of auxi - lin sedimented with clathrin in the position of cages , and 28 % were found in the low speed pellet . The remainder was recovered from the top of the gradient . Electron microscopy of negatively stained aliquots of the dialysate confirmed that auxilin functions as a clathrin as - sembly protein ( Fig . 7 ) . Compared to the very homogenous population of AP 180 - induced cages , 85 % of which have a diameter in the range of 60 - 79 nm , the size distribution of auxilin induced cages was much broader ( Fig . 8 ) . Only 55 % of the cages were within the 60 - 79 - nm range . Auxilin - induced cages also appeared to be more obviously filled or decorated with protein . In this respect , they resemble the cages assem - bled in the presence of the HA2 adaptor ( see Fig . 7 in refer - ence 22 ) . We also investigated the binding of auxilin to clathrin cages , preassembled in the presence of 2 mM cal - cium . Since auxilin proved to be exceptionally prone to aggregation below pH 7 . 0 , the binding experiment was per - formed at pH 7 . 2 in a Hepes / Tartrate buffer . A constant amount of clathrin cages ( 9 / ~ g ) were incubated with increas - ing amounts of auxilin for 30 min on ice and then ultracen - trifuged to separate bound from unbound auxilin . Pellets and supe . rnatants were analyzed by SDS - PAGE ( Fig . 9 ) . In the absence of clathrin , auxilin does not sediment under the con - ditions employed for the binding assay ( compare tracks 19 and 20 in Fig . 9 ) . Densitometric analysis of the titration ex - periment shows that binding of auxilin to clathrin cages satu - rates at three auxilin molecules per clathrin triskelion , corre - sponding to one auxilin per clathrin heavy chain ( Fig . 10 ) . Structural Characterization of Auxilin To determine whether auxilin is structurally related to the two other known clathrin - binding constituents , AP 180 and the ~ - subunit of the HA2 adaptor complex , peptide maps ( 5 ) of the three were compared . Auxilin and AP 180 were purified by immunoprecipitation and SDS - PAGE . The subunit was obtained by electrophoresis of the HA2 adaptor E 4O 3O 2O 10 I 5O ~ 0 3O 20 10 o [ - - - - I I 1 l I 0 I I I 50 60 70 90 100 coot diometer [ nm ] Figure 8 .

The protein content of pellets and supernatants was analyzed by SDS - PAGE . Odd numbers denote tracks of supernatants and even numbers denote the tracks of the corresponding pellets . Note that auxilin did not sediment when clathrin was omitted ( lane 20 ) . in urea - containing SDS gels . All proteins were iodinated in the gel and eluted after digestion with trypsin . The iodinated peptides were analyzed by two - dimensional peptide mapping on thin layer plates ( Fig . 11 ) . As with the immunological criterion , there is no extensive structural similarity between AP 180 , auxilin and the / ~ subunit of HA2 , although we can - not totally exclude a limited homology of peptides in the part of the map bracketed in Fig . 11 . We also mapped the 64 and 43 kD polypeptides , which copurified with auxilin . Both maps were very similar to that of auxilin , which confirms their identity as proteolytic fragments of auxilin ( data not shown ) . Molecular mass determinations of polypeptides by SDS - PAGE sometimes give erroneous results ( 31 ) . This is true of AP 180 , which migrates as a 180 - kD polypeptide in SDS - PAGE ( 2 , 34 ) , but was shown by three other methods to have a molecular mass of ' o120 , 000 ( 2 , 25 ) .

The elution volume corre - sponded to a protein of 86 , 000 mol wt ( Fig . 12 ) . We also deduced the molecular weight of native auxilin from its Stokes radius and sedimentation coefficient . For the determination of the Stokes radius , auxilin was chromatographed on a cal - ibrated Superose 12 gel filtration column equilibrated in 0 . 5 M Tris . The Stokes radius was found to be 62 / k ( Fig . 13 ) , which is close to that of the HA2 adaptor , but much smaller than that of AP 180 ( 81 / ~ , , reference 1 ) . By centrifugation in calibrated sucrose gradients , we obtained a sedimentation coefficient of 3 . 2 S ( not shown ) . Assuming a partial specific volume of 0 . 73 ml / g , we obtain a molecular weight of 84 , 000 , in good agreement with the value from gel filtration of the unfolded chain . Thus , the value determined by SDS gel elec - trophoresis is wrong and , in 0 . 5 M Tris , auxilin is like AP 180 released as a monomer from the coated vesicle membrane . Distribution of Auxilin Bovine brain , liver , and adrenal gland were examined by im - munoblotting for the presence of auxilin . Immunologically detectable amounts of auxilin were found only in brain homogenates ( Fig . 14 ) . Thus , it seems likely that auxilin like AP 180 , is confined to neuronal tissue ( 3 , 19 ) . This conclusion is also supported by our failure to detect auxilin in coated vesicles from placenta and adrenal gland by biochemical means ( data not shown ) . Quantitative immunoprecipitation of auxilin in brain homogenates showed that , , 045 % of auxi - lin is associated with membranes while 55 % was found in the cytosolic fraction . This ratio is similar to that obtained for the adaptors in brain ( data not shown ) .

Total coat protein unfolded in 6 M guanidinium - HCl , 2 mM EDTA , and 1 mM DTT was ap - plied to a calibrated Superose 6 gel filtration column . The elution volume of auxilin which was determined by SDS - PAGE and immu - noblotting ( see Materials and Methods for details ) corresponded to a molecular weight of 86 , 000 . The column was calibrated with myo - sin ( 210 kD ) , thyroglobulin ( 165 kD ) , B - galactosidase ( 116 kD ) , covered a new 86 , 000 D coat protein , which we have named auxilin . We have identified it as a component of clathrin - coated vesicles on the grounds that it co - migrates with them in differential centrifugation and in free flow electropho - resis and moreover that it interacts stoichiometrically with clathrin in vitro . Auxilin is a peripheral membrane protein , which is extracted from the coated vesicle membrane with 0 . 5 M Tris together with clathrin , the adaptor complexes and AP 180 . Auxilin represents in coated vesicle from brain tis - sue " ~ 9 % of the total 100 - 120 - kD polypeptides . This corre - sponds to one auxilin per HAl adaptor , to three molecules rabbit immunoglobulins heavy ( 55 kD ) , and light chains ( 25 kD ) . The arrow denotes the elution position of auxilin .

Thus , auxilin cannot be regarded as a particular minor component of coated vesicles . Auxilin supports assembly of clathrin into polygonal cages that are similar in size to those induced by AP 180 . The mechanism by which auxilin induces clathrin assembly has not been investigated , but it could be related to its tendency to self - associate under conditions that also fa - vor clathrin assembly . For example , if clathrin - bound auxilin were able to form dimers , cross - linking of adjacent triskel - ion legs would result . The ratio of one auxilin per clathrin heavy chain found in cages is compatible with a model of this kind . Auxilin is immunologically unrelated to any of the other proteins in clathrin coated vesicles . Peptide mapping has ex - cluded any major similarity to the / 3 subunit of the HA2 adaptor and AP 180 , which are both known to interact directly with clathrin ( 1 , 2 , 25 ) , although we clearly cannot entirely rule out limited homologies between these proteins . Unless the three proteins bind to different sites on clathrin , local homologies would not be unexpected , but , apart from a set of two to three poorly resolved peptides , which may be common to all three proteins , we do not yet have any indica - tions to this effect . Furthermore , peptide maps of ~ and 3 ' subunits of the adaptors ( see Figs . 5 and 6 in reference 3 ) show no significant homologies to auxilin . The purification of two presumably different polypeptides with clathrin assembly promoting properties in the molecu - lar mass range of 100 - 110 kD ( as judged by their mobility on standard SDS - PAGE ) has been described in reports by Edelhoch and his co - workers ( 8 , 26 ) . Based on the available information , however , it is difficult to relate them unambigu - ously either to the subunits of the adaptor complexes or to auxilin . Both proteins were exposed to 2 or 3 M urea during purification , conditions known to cause dissociation of adap - tor subunits ( 1 ) . However , on the basis of physical properties such as sedimentation constants and molecular weight , it ap - pears very unlikely that the l14 , 000 - D protein , which was studied by Prasad and colleagues in 3 M urea ( 26 ) , is auxilin . A 110 - kD polypeptide , extracted with 2 M urea from bovine brain - coated vesicles and then purified on lysine - Sepharose was not further characterized , and could thus have been a liberated adaptor subunit , auxilin , or an unrelated species ( 8 ) . Although distinct proteins , AP 180 and auxilin have more in common with each other than with the structurally more complex adaptors . Both appear to be restricted to neuronal tissue ( 3 , 19 ) ; they are released from coated vesicles by 0 . 5 M Tris as monomers ( 2 ) , behave anomalously in SDS gel electrophoresis ( 2 , 25 , 35 ) , are very susceptible to proteo - lytic attack ( 2 ) , and have very low sedimentation constants , suggestive of an extended structure for both . We therefore hesitate to equate auxilin and AP 180 with additional adap - tors . The apparent restriction of both proteins to neuronal tissue implies that coated vesicles from other tissues function without them . This then affords another example of the adap - tation of coated vesicles to specific requirements of neuronal Figure 14 . Tissue specificity of auxilin . Crude membranes from brain ( a ) , liver ( b ) , and adrenal gland ( c ) were extracted with 0 . 5 M Tris and then fractionated by SDS - PAGE . Nitrocellulose replicas of the gel were reacted with antibodies against the / ~ and / ~ ' adaptor subunits ( tracks 1 , 4 , and 7 ) , an - tiauxilin ( tracks 2 , 5 , and 8 ) , and anti - AP 180 ( tracks 3 , 6 , and 9 ) . Note that auxilin and AP 180 immunoreactivity appears only in brain tissue .

The light chains and the ~ subunit of the HA2 adaptor have already been shown to contain brain - specific inserts ( 9 , 14 , 15 , 28 ) . The functions of auxilin and AP 180 are unlikely to be restricted to promoting clathrin assembly . This prop - erty might be only a reflection of their preference for assem - bled over free clathrin . The substoichiometric amounts of both proteins in coated vesicle preparations ( relative to clath - rin ) suggests a restriction to subpopulations of coated vesi - cles , in which either occurs in stoichiometric amounts . We hope to prove the existence of these with available monoclo - nal antibodies either by immunopurification of a subpopula - tion of coated vesicles or by immunoelectronmicroscopy . Drs . W . Gratzer and S . Morris are thanked for helpful comments on the manuscript and U . Eichelsbacher for purifying coated vesicles by free flow electrophoresis and for monoclonal antibody production .
