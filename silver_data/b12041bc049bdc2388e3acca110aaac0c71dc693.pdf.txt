Although ECM engagement at focal adhesions is known to trigger the recruitment of hundreds of proteins ( ‘‘adhesome’’ ) to ﬁne - tune cellular behavior , the components of the ﬁlopodia adhesions remain undeﬁned . Here , we performed a structured - illumination - microscopy - based screen to map the localization of 80 target proteins , linked to cell adhesionand migration , within myosin - X - induced ﬁlopodia . We demonstrate preferential enrichment of several adhesion proteins to either ﬁlopodia tips , ﬁlo - podia shafts , or shaft subdomains , suggesting diver - gent , spatially restricted functions for these proteins . Moreover , proteins with phosphoinositide ( PI ) binding sites are particularly enriched in ﬁlopodia . This , together withthestrong localization of PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 in ﬁlo - podia tips , predicts critical roles for PIs in regulating ﬁlopodia ultra - structure and function . Our mapping further reveals that ﬁlopodia adhesions consist of a unique set of proteins , the ﬁlopodome , that are distinct from classical nascent adhesions , focal adhe - sions , and ﬁbrillar adhesions . Using live imaging , we observe that ﬁlopodia adhesions can give rise to nascent adhesions , which , in turn , form focal adhe - sions . We demonstrate that p130Cas ( BCAR1 ) is recruited to ﬁlopodia tips via its C - terminal Cas family homology domain ( CCHD ) and acts as a mechano - sensitive regulator of ﬁlopodia stability . Finally , we demonstrate that our map based on myosin - X - induced ﬁlopodia can be translated to endogenous ﬁ - lopodia and fascin - and IRSp53 - mediated ﬁlopodia . INTRODUCTION The ability of cells to migrate in vivo is necessary for many phys - iological processes , including embryonic development , tissue homeostasis , and wound healing . Cell migration is also impli - cated in distinct pathological conditions , such as inﬂammation and cancer metastasis . To migrate , cells interact with their envi - ronment , the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) , via adhesion receptors , such as integrins , which provide a physical link between the ECM and the actin cytoskeleton [ 1 ] . Integrin function is controlled by a conformational switch between active and inactive states that determines ECM ligand interaction and subsequent receptor signaling [ 2 ] . Integrin activation can be triggered from within the cell by several mechanisms , including the Rap1 - RIAM - talin pathway . In 2D , integrin - ligand engagement leads to the assem - bly of large signaling platforms , termed focal adhesions ( FAs ) , which are composed of hundreds of proteins collectively termed the adhesome [ 3 , 4 ] . FAs are highly dynamic and complex struc - tures that develop from force - dependent maturation of nascent adhesions at the leading edge and which undergo integrin - spe - ciﬁc centripetal translocation to form ﬁbrillar adhesions . Impor - tantly , FAs not only provide anchorage but also represent integ - rin heterodimer - ligand - speciﬁc [ 5 ] and / or ECM - ligand - speciﬁc signaling nodes with mechanosensing functions [ 6 ] and there - fore constitute ideal signaling platforms for ECM recognition . Cell motility through complex 3D microenvironments also re - quires efﬁcient probing of the cell surroundings , including ECM and neighboring cells , via specialized sensory protrusions , such as ﬁlopodia [ 7 ] . Filopodia , ﬁnger - like actin - rich protrusions widely used by cells in vivo during normal processes ( e . g . , devel - opment , immune surveillance , and wound healing ) and also dur - ing tumorigenesis and cancer cell dissemination [ 7 , 8 ] , are often the very ﬁrst point of contact between a cell and its immediate surroundings . To this end , ﬁlopodia contain cell - surface recep - tors , such as integrins , cadherins , and growth factor receptors , that can interact with , and interpret , a wide variety of cues . In the context of ECM recognition , cues include ECM gradients [ 9 ] , ECM topography [ 10 ] , or ECM stiffness [ 11 , 12 ] . Thus , ﬁlopo - dia contribute to haptotaxis [ 9 ] and possibly to durotaxis [ 13 ] . Fi - lopodia are very dynamic structures that stabilize upon ECM tethering and formation of an adhesive structure , at their tips , termed ﬁlopodia adhesion . ECM attachment at ﬁlopodia is dependent on integrins , which are actively transported to ﬁlopo - dia tips by the motor protein myosin - X ( MYO10 ) [ 14 ] . In addition , ﬁlopodia stabilization requires both talin - mediated integrin acti - vation and integrin downstream signaling at the ﬁlopodium tip 202 Current Biology 29 , 202 – 216 , January 21 , 2019 ª 2018 The Author ( s ) .

However , the composition of ﬁlopodia adhesions remains poorly deﬁned . The composition and architecture of FAs have been exten - sively studied using both microscopy and mass - spectrometric - based strategies [ 4 , 16 ] . Importantly , the compilation of FA com - ponents , either by literature curation ( Geiger adhesome ) [ 3 ] or by proteomic approaches ( consensus adhesome ) [ 4 ] , have led to signiﬁcant advances in our understanding of adhesion - mediated processes . Considering that ﬁlopodia are signiﬁcant structures in vivo that are also implicated in various biological processes and pathologies , such as angiogenesis and cancer progression [ 8 ] , a more detailed analysis of proteins recruited to ﬁlopodia ad - hesions is likely to be fundamental to better understand ﬁlopodia functions . Filopodia are relatively small and labile structures ( 1 - to 5 - m m length and 50 - to 200 - nm width ) and are therefore difﬁcult to purify in a scale sufﬁcient to perform mass spectrom - etry analyses . Here , to characterize the composition of ﬁlopodia tip adhesions , we used a targeted approach and mapped the localization of 80 proteins , implicated in cellular adhesion or pro - tein - membrane lipid interactions , using structured illumination microscopy ( SIM ) . RESULTS Mapping Protein Localization in Filopodia Using SIM To identify proteins that localize to ﬁlopodia , we performed a SIM - based screen , spanning 80 putative regulators of cellular adhesion or protein - membrane lipid association . Proteins of in - terest ( POIs ) ( Data S1 ) included known ﬁlopodia components , actin regulators , established FA components ( Geiger adhesome ) [ 3 ] , and adhesion proteins consistently identiﬁed in multiple mass spectrometry studies ( consensus adhesome ) [ 4 ] . We chose to visualize all the POIs as GFP - fusion proteins , as it was not feasible to generate , validate , and optimize antibodies against all endogenous POIs . Cells adhering to ﬁbronectin and transiently co - expressing a GFP - tagged POI and red ﬂuorescent protein ( RFP ) - MYO10 ( to induce and visualize ﬁlopodia tips ) were stained for F - actin and imaged using SIM ( Figures 1A and 1B ) . SIM images of each POI are provided as Supplemental In - formation ( Data S1 and S2 ) . Strikingly , 15 of the 38 consensus adhesome proteins [ 4 ] imaged did not display clear accumula - tion in FAs ( Figure 1C ; Data S2 ) , suggesting that they may contribute to other cell - ECM interfaces . To study POI localization and distribution along ﬁlopodia , line intensity proﬁles , manually drawn from ﬁlopodium tip to base ( Figures 1A and 1B ) , were ob - tained for > 200 ﬁlopodia per POI . Importantly , to evaluate POI distribution across multiple cells , the brightness and contrast of each image was automatically adjusted using the brightest cellular structure as the upper limit . Line intensity proﬁles were used to determine the percentage of ﬁlopodia positive for each POI ( Figure 1C ) , ﬁlopodia length ( Figure S1 ) , and to create a map highlighting the distribution of the POIs within ﬁlopodia ( Fig - ure 2 ; see STAR Methods for details ) . The ImageJ macro and R scripts used to perform these quantiﬁcations are available as supplemental ﬁles ( Data S2 ) . Protein Mapping Reveals Classes of Core and Accessory Filopodia Proteins Multiple established ﬁlopodia - localizing proteins , including ta - lin - 1 ( TLN1 ) [ 17 ] , formin - like protein 3 ( FMNL3 ) [ 18 ] , lamellipodin ( RAPH1 ) [ 19 ] , vasodilator - stimulated phosphoprotein ( VASP ) [ 20 ] , mDia2 ( DIAPH3 ) [ 21 ] , and fascin ( FSCN1 ) [ 22 ] were clearly detected with high resolution in ﬁlopodia , validating our approach . Our comprehensive mapping revealed that the pro - teins imaged here could be organized into three categories ac - cording to detection frequency within ﬁlopodia . The ﬁrst cate - gory is composed of POIs that are primarily absent from ﬁlopodia ( Data S2 ; Figure 1C ) , and due to low detection rate , we consider these proteins not to be ﬁlopodia proteins . The sec - ond category of POI is detected in a high proportion of ﬁlopodia ( 60 % – 100 % ) , indicating that these proteins are core ﬁlopodia proteins ( Data S2 ; Figure 1C ) . The third category of POI is those reliably detected but present in only a small fraction of ﬁlopodia ( 10 % – 40 % ) , suggesting that these proteins may be accessory ﬁlopodia proteins contributing to ﬁlopodia - speciﬁc functions or deﬁning subsets of biologically distinct ﬁlopodia ( Data S2 ; Figure 1C ) . Phosphoinositide PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 Is Enriched at Filopodia Tips To uncover common elements among the core ﬁlopodia proteins identiﬁed here , a protein domain enrichment analysis was per - formed ( Figure 3A ) . This analysis revealed that proteins contain - ing the four - point - one , ezrin , radixin , moesin ( FERM ) ( 24 % ) and / or SRC homology 3 ( SH3 ) ( 21 % ) and / or pleckstrin homology ( PH ) - like ( 34 % ) domains are enriched in ﬁlopodia ( Figure 3A ) . A strong enrichment of proteins containing PH - like domains led us to speculate that the phosphoinositide ( PI ) composition of ﬁlopodia could be a key contributor to ﬁlopodia function . To map the distribution of the various PI in ﬁlopodia , GFP - tagged probes with high afﬁnity to a single PI species [ 23 ] were imaged using SIM and analyzed as described above ( Figures 3B and 3C ) . PI ( 3 ) P ( imaged using GFP - FYVE - PH ) was mostly de - tected on vesicular structures within the cell body , but not in ﬁlo - podia ( Figures3B and 3C ) . PI ( 4 ) P ( imaged using GFP - P4M ) local - ized at the plasma membrane and on intracellular vesicles but was only weakly detected within ﬁlopodia ( Figures 3B and 3C ) . In contrast , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( labeled with GFP - PLC g PH ) and PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ( labeled with GFP - BTK - PH ) were both strongly detected within ﬁlopodia with a relatively homogeneous distribution ( similar to the plasma membrane ) . Strikingly , PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 ( labeled using GFP - TAPP - PH ) was also detected in ﬁlopodia , but in contrast to the other PI , PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 was strongly enriched to ﬁlopo - dia tips . Importantly , PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 accumulation at ﬁlopodia tips was conﬁrmed in live cells ( Figure 3D ; Video S1 ) and in endogenous ﬁlopodia ( Figure 3E ) . This accumulation of PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 to ﬁlopodia tips is surprising and suggests that PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 contributes to ( C ) The percentage of ﬁlopodia positive for each POI as determined from line intensity proﬁles . Colored circles indicate POI inclusion in the Geiger adhesome [ 3 ] ( red circle ) and / or the consensus adhesome [ 4 ] ( blue circle ) and / or accumulation in focal adhesions ( FAs ) ( this study , yellow circle ) ; ‘‘core ﬁlopodia proteins’’ and ‘‘accessory ﬁlopodia proteins’’ are labeled . See also Data S1 and S2 . 204 Current Biology 29 , 202 – 216 , January 21 , 2019 ﬁlopodia tip functions or organization . Future work will aim at identifying the role of PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 in ﬁlopodia as well as the proteins that are responsible for its accumulation at ﬁlopodia tips . SIM Mapping Reveals Novel Filopodia Tip Proteins and Subdomains within Filopodia Shafts To quantitatively analyze the preferential recruitment of the core ﬁlopodia proteins , identiﬁed here , to ﬁlopodia tips or shafts , an enrichment ratio was calculated ( Figure 4 ) . As expected , proteins known to compose the tip complex , such as MYO10 [ 14 ] , VASP [ 20 ] , DIAPH3 [ 21 ] , FMNL3 [ 18 ] , and RAPH1 [ 19 ] , were strongly enriched to ﬁlopodia tips ( Figure 4 ) . Importantly , our analysis re - vealed that F - actin is low in the ﬁlopodium tip compared to the ﬁlopodium shaft . Conversely , the amount of plasma membrane was slightly enriched at ﬁlopodium tips compared to shafts ( Fig - ures 2 and 4 ) . This is likely due to the formation of a bud at the end of ﬁlopodia . Therefore , the enrichment score of a POI was compared to the enrichment score obtained for the plasma membrane rather than the enrichment score of F - actin ( Figure 4 ) . Figure 2 . Generation of a Filopodia Map Us - ing Correlative Imaging and Intensity Proﬁle Averaging Heatmap demonstrating the subcellular localiza - tion of each POI within ﬁlopodia based on > 250 intensity proﬁles ( measured as in Figure 1 ; n numbers can be found in Data S1 ) . POIs are labeled using their ofﬁcial human gene name . To createthismap , intensityproﬁlesofeachPOIwere binned ( 40 bins per ﬁlopodium for each intensity proﬁle ) and then averaged ( see STAR Methods for more details ) and displayed as a heatmap . POIs are labeled using their ofﬁcial human gene name ; ﬁlopodium tip ( deﬁned by MYO10 ) and ﬁlopodium shaft are highlighted . See also Figure S1 and Data S1 and S2 . Our mapping revealed several original ﬁlopodia tip proteins , such as p130Cas ( BCAR1 ) , tensin - 4 ( TNS4 ) , and crk ( CRK ) . Other proteins displaying prefer - ential recruitment to ﬁlopodia tips over ﬁlopodia shafts include the integrin activity modulators TLN1 and talin - 2 ( TLN2 ) , kindlin - 2 ( FERMT2 ) , and ICAP - 1 ( ITGB1BP1 ; Figures 2 and 4 ) . Proteins strongly enriched to ﬁlopodia shafts include predominantly actin - regulating and cross - linking proteins , such as eplins ( LIMA1a and LIMA1b ) , alpha - actinin - 1 ( ACTN1 ) , plastin ( PLS3 ) , and ezrin ( EZR ) ( Figures 2 and 4 ) . Interestingly , eps8 ( EPS8 ) and IRSp53 ( BAIAP2 ) , two regula - tors of ﬁlopodia formation , which are also known to interact with each other [ 24 ] , appear to be spatially segregated within established ﬁlopodia as BAIAP2 accu - mulates at ﬁlopodia tips while EPS8 is enriched to ﬁlopodia shafts ( Fig - ures 2 and 4 ) . Filopodia shafts can be segmented into subdomains depending on the degree of pene - tration of certain proteins throughout the ﬁlopodium ( from the base of the shaft toward the tip ) . For instance , ACTN1 labels only the base ( ﬁrst 20 % ) of the shaft and proteins , such as EZR or LIMA1 , label the ﬁrst 50 % – 60 % portion of the shaft ( Figure 2 ) . The segregation of the ﬁlopodia shaft into subdo - mains could indicate that these segments are also functionally different . Filopodia Adhesions Are Distinct from Other Adhesions In migrating cells , adhesion sites are highly dynamic struc - tures that undergo a well - deﬁned force - dependent maturation sequence from nascent adhesions to ﬁbrillar adhesions [ 25 ] . Our SIM - based mapping allowed us to identify several estab - lished integrin binders and integrin activity regulators ( TLN1 and TLN2 ; FERMT1 and FERMT2 ; and ITGB1BP1 ) as core ﬁlopodia proteins , while other integrin binders and regulators , such as tensin - 1 ( TNS1 ) , tensin - 3 ( TNS3 ) , MDGI ( FABP3 ) , ﬁlamin - a ( FLNA ) , and nischarin ( NISCH ) , were absent from Current Biology 29 , 202 – 216 , January 21 , 2019 205 ﬁlopodia . In addition , components of the signaling modules BCAR1 - CRK and the Ilk - pinch - parvin complex ( ILK , LIMS1 , and PARVA ; IPP complex ) were detected in ﬁlopodia with similar distributions ( Figures 1 and 2 ) . Several proteins accumulating in FAs were also detected in most ﬁlopodia , including VASP , ACTN1 , testin ( TES ) , LASP - 1 ( LASP1 ) , and vinculin ( VCL ) . A B C D E Figure 3 .

See also Data S1 and S2 . 206 Current Biology 29 , 202 – 216 , January 21 , 2019 Filopodia are regions of low force in the cell [ 7 ] , and therefore , it is not surprising that proteins associated with mature and / or ﬁbrillar adhesions were not identiﬁed as core ﬁlopodia proteins . These proteins include the actin - binding tensin isoforms ( TNS1 – 3 ) [ 26 ] , PDLIM1 / 5 / 7 [ 27 ] , TRIP6 [ 27 ] , zyxin ( ZYX ) [ 26 ] , and palladin ( PALLD ) [ 28 ] ( Figures 1 and 2 ) . In addition , the major non - muscle myosins mediating cellular contractility , non - muscle myosin heavy chain IIa ( MYH9 ) and non - muscle myosin heavy chain IIb ( MYH10 ) , were not detected in ﬁlopodia . Importantly , multiple proteins associated with the low force - bearing nascent adhesions , including paxillin ( PXN ) [ 29 ] , FAK ( PTK2 ) [ 30 ] , or arp3 ( ACTR3 ) [ 31 ] , were classiﬁed as ﬁlopodia accessory , not core , proteins , as they were detected in < 40 % of ﬁlopodia ( Figures 1 and 2 ) . Thus , our SIM mapping indicates that ﬁlopodia adhesions consist of a unique set of proteins , the ﬁlopodome , and are distinct from classical nascent adhesions , FAs and ﬁbrillar adhesions . Figure 4 . Preferential Enrichment of Adhe - sion Proteins to Filopodium Shaft or Tip The preferential recruitment of core ﬁlopodia pro - teins to ﬁlopodia tips or shafts was assessed by calculatinganenrichmentratio ( averagedintensity at ﬁlopodium tip versus shaft ) . Results are dis - played as Tukey boxplots using a logarithmic scale , and the POIs are ordered as a function of the median enrichment score . Enrichment scores of F - actin and the plasma membrane ( labeled by CAAX - GFP ) are highlighted in orange . A median enrichment score displaying R two - fold change over that of the plasma membrane was consid - ered to represent strong POI enrichment to either ﬁlopodia tips ( R two - fold increase , highlighted in green ) or to ﬁlopodia shafts ( R two - fold decrease , highlighted in blue ) . Statistically signiﬁcant enrichment scores are noted as either ‘‘increased inﬁlopodia tips’’or‘‘increased inﬁlopodia shafts . ’’ See also Data S1 and S2 . Filopodia Adhesions Nucleate Nascent Adhesions The absence of PXN or PTK2 in > 60 % of ﬁlopodia was unexpected , as there are documented interactions between these two proteins and a large number of the core ﬁlopodia proteins identiﬁed here ( Figure S2A ) . In line with our mapping data using GFP - tagged proteins , we found that endogenous ILK and TLN1 / 2 localize to ﬁlopodia and PXN and PTK2 were observed only in a small percentage of ﬁlopodia ( Figures S2B – S2E ) . When PXN was detected within ﬁlopodia , its localization varied between being de - tected at the tip and / or in the shaft ( Fig - ure S2E ) , and we hypothesized that the variable localization of PXN in ﬁlopodia could be linked to ﬁlopodia dynamics . Previous work has reported MYO10 localization in nascent adhesion prior to ﬁlopodia elongation [ 32 ] , but we did not observe this phenome - non here . Live - cell imaging revealed that unstable ﬁlopodia are devoid of PXN ( Figure 5A ; Video S2 ) , whereas , in stable ﬁlopodia , PXN is initially detected brieﬂy at the tip , followed by localization to , and increased clustering in , ﬁlopodia shafts , possibly due to actin retrograde ﬂow . Upon lamellipodia advancement , these clusters of PXN gave rise to FAs ( Figure 5A ; Video S2 ) . These data suggest that stabilized ﬁlopodia adhesions can trigger the nucleation of nascent adhesions . BCAR1 Is a Novel Component of the Filopodia Tip Complex Talin - mediated integrin activation and linkage to the actin cyto - skeleton are required for ﬁlopodia stabilization and maturation into adhesions [ 15 ] . As adhesion maturation strongly correlates with increasing forces exerted on the substrate , this prompted us to review our core ﬁlopodia proteins for other potential force Current Biology 29 , 202 – 216 , January 21 , 2019 207 A B C D E F Figure 5 .

( legend continued on next page ) 208 Current Biology 29 , 202 – 216 , January 21 , 2019 sensors . BCAR1 ( p130Cas ) , one of our ﬁlopodia core compo - nents ( Figure 1 ) strongly enriched in ﬁlopodia tips ( Figure 4 ) , has been implicated as a mechanosensitive protein that be - comes phosphorylated by SRC in response to mechanical stretch [ 33 ] . We ﬁrst validated our mapping data by staining endogenous BCAR1 and found that it indeed localizes to ﬁlopo - dia tips ( Figure S3A ) . In addition , a phosphorylation - speciﬁc anti - body indicated that endogenous BCAR1 is phosphorylated at ﬁ - lopodia tips , where it co - localizes with MYO10 , but not with PXN ( Figures 5B and S3B ) . Live - cell imaging also conﬁrmed our map - ping data , as BCAR1 was always observed at ﬁlopodia tips , regardless of ﬁlopodia stability ( Figure 5C ; Video S3 ) , in a similar fashion to TLN1 ( Figure 5D ; Video S4 ) , and ITGA5 distribution was relatively homogeneous ( Figure 5E ; Video S5 ) . Altogether , our data indicate that BCAR1 is a constitutive component of the ﬁlopodia tip complex ( Figures 1 and 5 ) , and its phosphoryla - tion status suggests that it may play a role in ECM sensing in ﬁlopodia adhesions . BCAR1 Is Recruited to Filopodia Tips via Its CCHD BCAR1 localization to FAs has been suggested to be regulated via direct interaction with PXN or PTK2 [ 34 , 35 ] , both of which are absent from most ﬁlopodia . In addition , BCAR1 recruitment to ﬁlopodia tips is insensitive to inhibition of SRC , PTK2 , or cellular contractility ( Figure S3C ) . Together , this suggested that BCAR1 localization to ﬁlopodia tips occurs via a distinct mecha - nism to its FA targeting . BCAR1 is composed of ﬁve principal domains , including an N - terminal SH3 domain followed by a proline - rich region , a substrate domain , a serine - rich region , and a C - terminal Cas family homology domain ( CCHD ) [ 36 ] . We analyzed the subcellular location of BCAR1 constructs lack - ing the SH3 domain and / or the CCHD and , as previously described , observed that constructs lacking the SH3 domain or the CCHD accumulated poorly to FAs , and the construct lack - ing both domains was completely absent from FAs ( Figure S4 ) [ 37 ] . Importantly , constructs lacking the CCHD failed to accumu - late to ﬁlopodia tips , and the construct lacking the SH3 domain accumulated to ﬁlopodia tips to the same extent as the full - length wild - type construct ( Figures 5F and S4 ) . This indicates that BCAR1 CCHD , but not the SH3 domain , is required to target BCAR1 to ﬁlopodia tips . Importantly , BCAR1 CCHD alone is suf - ﬁcient for ﬁlopodia tip localization , demonstrating that BCAR1 CCHD is both a FA - targeting domain and a ﬁlopodia - tip - com - plex - targeting domain ( Figure 5F ) . BCAR1 Contributes to Filopodia Stabilization and Stiffness Sensing Previously , we revealed that integrin activation as well as integrin downstream signaling are required for efﬁcient ﬁlopodia forma - tion and stabilization [ 15 ] . In order to investigate the potential role of BCAR1 in these processes , we silenced BCAR1 expres - sion using two independent small interfering RNAs ( siRNAs ) ( Fig - ure 6A ) . In U2OS and MDA - MB - 231 cells , silencing of BCAR1 led to an increase in the number of MYO10 ﬁlopodia ( Figures 6B and 6C ) , and overall ﬁlopodia length remained unaffected ( Fig - ure S5A ) . Importantly , the effect of BCAR1 silencing on ﬁlopodia numbers could be rescued by expressing murine GFP - BCAR1 , but not by expressing GFP - BCAR1 lacking the CCHD ( Fig - ure 6D ) . These data indicate that BCAR1 , unlike TLN1 [ 15 ] , is not essential for ﬁlopodia formation . However , BCAR1 is critical for efﬁcient ﬁlopodia stabilization , as BCAR1 - silenced cells displayed a higher proportion of unstable ﬁlopodia and a lower proportion of stable ﬁlopodia compared with control cells ( Figure 6E ) . BCAR1 silencing did not appear to impair the ability of U2OS cells to generate traction forces ( Figure S5B ) . As BCAR1 Y410 phosphorylation is increased upon mechanical stretch , a pro - cess that enables cells to sense the mechanical properties of the ECM [ 33 ] , and as BCAR1 is phosphorylated at ﬁlopodia tips ( Figure 5B ) , we speculated that BCAR1 phosphorylation could be one of the signals , used at ﬁlopodia tips , to sense stiff - ness . Using ﬁbronectin - coated polyacrylamide gels of deﬁned stiffness ( 0 . 5 kPa , soft ; 50 kPa , stiff ) , we found that BCAR1 Y410 phosphorylation was signiﬁcantly higher at ﬁlopodia tips when cells were plated on a stiffer substrate compared to a softer environment ( Figure 6F ) . Interestingly , when plated on a soft substrate , cells formed a much higher number of MYO10 ﬁ - lopodia ( Figures 6G and S5C ) , most of which were unstable ( Fig - ure 6H ) . These data mirror the results obtained when BCAR1 is downregulated and cells are plated on stiff substrate ( Figures 6B - 6E ) . Taken together , our data clearly demonstrate that BCAR1 is part of the ﬁlopodia tip mechanosensitive machinery , which attenuates initiation of new ﬁlopodia downstream of ﬁlo - podia stabilization . Taking the Filopodome beyond MYO10 - Induced Filopodia Here , we used MYO10 - induced ﬁlopodia as a model to charac - terize the composition of ﬁlopodia tip adhesions ( ﬁlopodome ) . Importantly , we could validate our key ﬁndings in endogenous ﬁ - lopodia , including the presence of the ﬁlopodome components RAPH1 , BCAR1 , VASP , and TLN1 ( Figures 7A and S6A ) and the absence of PXN ( Figure S6A ) . BCAR1 Y410 phosphorylation could also be detected at the tips of endogenous ﬁlopodia in RAT2 , MCF10DCIS . com and U2OS cells ( Figures 7B – 7D ) as well as at the tip of ﬁlopodia induced by FSCN1 or BAIP2 ( Figures 7E and 7F ) . Taken together , these data clearly demonstrate that our mapping data can be translated to other ﬁlopodia subtypes .

( legend continued on next page ) 210 Current Biology 29 , 202 – 216 , January 21 , 2019 Interestingly , we could not detect BCAR1 Y410 phosphoryla - tion or TLN2 at the tips of FMNL3 - induced ﬁlopodia ( Figures 7G and 7H ) , which prompted us to further analyze their compo - sition and dynamics . Live - cell imaging revealed that FMNL3 - induced ﬁlopodia hover over the substrate but fail to stabilize ( Figure 7I ; Video S6 ) . In line with the lack of TLN2 , the integrin pool within FMNL3 - induced ﬁlopodia appears to be mostly inac - tive compared to the integrin activity levels in MYO10 - induced ﬁlopodia ( Figures 7J and 7K ) . Absent or reduced integrin activa - tion in FMNL3 - induced ﬁlopodia likely explains the failure of these ﬁlopodia to stabilize . These data clearly demonstrate the importance of integrin inside - out signaling in activating integrins at ﬁlopodia tips , and future work will aim at deciphering the contribution of the ﬁlopodome components in regulating integrin activity . DISCUSSION Filopodia are sensory protrusions specialized in probing the cellular environment , including neighboring cells , chemokines , and the ECM . Here , to gain insight into the composition and bio - logical function of ﬁlopodia tip adhesions , we mapped the sub - ﬁlopodia localization of 80 proteins linked to cell adhesion and migration using MYO10 - induced ﬁlopodia as a model system ( Figures 1 , 2 , and 4 ) . Additionally , we validated our data in both endogenous ﬁlopodia and in ﬁlopodia induced by other factors ( Figure 7 ) ; however , our map is unlikely to be applicable to all types of ﬁlopodia or ﬁlopodia - like protrusions . For instance , we report that FMNL3 - induced ﬁlopodia do not form adhesions at their tips and therefore are substantially different from MYO10 - induced ﬁlopodia ( Figure 7 ) . In addition , it is likely that the composition of ﬁlopodia tip adhesions described here will vary in function of the cell types and / or conditions used . For instance , as demonstrated for the adhesome [ 38 ] , the ECM ( biochemical composition and / or stiffness ) engaged at ﬁlopodia tips is likely to tune the composition of the ﬁlopodome . Our mapping revealed an enrichment of proteins binding to PI in ﬁlopodia ( Figure 3 ) . Mapping of multiple PI species identiﬁed spatial segregation of these PI within ﬁlopodia . PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 display a homogeneous distribution , whereas PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 exhibits strong enrichment to ﬁlopodia tips ( Figure 3 ) . PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is an activator of both CDC42 and N - WASP , two pro - motors of ﬁlopodia formation [ 39 ] , and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - rich lipid bila - yers induce the elongation of ﬁlopodia - like structures in vitro [ 40 ] . PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 can also induce ﬁlopodia by activating MYO10 , and preventing PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 generation by inhibiting phosphoino - sitide 3 - kinase is sufﬁcient to block ﬁlopodia formation [ 41 ] . The ﬁlopodia - tip localization of PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 is an original observation , and its role in ﬁlopodia remains to be investigated . PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 was reported to promote stability and maturation of invadopodia via the recruitment of Tks5 [ 42 , 43 ] . Enrichment of PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 to ﬁ - lopodia tips is likely to promote the accumulation of speciﬁc pro - teins . In our study , we found that lamellipodin ( RAPH1 ) , a known PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 binder [ 19 ] , accumulates to ﬁlopodia tips ( Figures 2 and 4 ) . In vitro , PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 inhibits PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - mediated actin poly - merization [ 44 ] , and therefore , PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 could also play a role in constraining ﬁlopodia extension . Future work will aim at iden - tifying the role of PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 in ﬁlopodia as well as the proteins that are responsible for its accumulation in ﬁlopodia tips . Integrin function is controlled by a conformational switch be - tween active and inactive states that dictate integrin - ECM ligand interaction [ 2 ] . Here , we report that integrin activation , from within the cell , at ﬁlopodia , is key for ﬁlopodia stabilization and ECM sensing ( Figure 7 ) . Our mapping revealed a speciﬁc subset of known integrin binders and activity modulators that are re - cruited to ﬁlopodia . These include the integrin activators talins and kindlins as well as the integrin inactivators ICAP - 1 ( ITGB1BP1 ) and moesin ( MSN ) ( Figure 2 ) , all of which bind to the b 1 integrin cytoplasmic tail on overlapping sites [ 45 ] . Future challenges will be to establish how integrin functions , including transport and activation , are coordinated by multiple adaptors within ﬁlopodia and what is the sequence and hierarchy of pro - tein binding to the short cytoplasmic domains of integrin b subunits . Filopodia sense ECM topography and / or ECM stiffness [ 10 – 12 ] . We previously observed that ﬁlopodia stabilization pre - cedes FA maturation and that this process directs cell migration [ 15 ] . Here , we observed that PXN - positive adhesions could form in ﬁlopodia shafts , which , upon lamellipodia advancement [ 46 ] , lead to the formation of FAs ( Figure 5 ) . As ﬁlopodia are widely used by cells migrating in ﬁbrillar matrices [ 47 , 48 ] , it is tempting to speculate that the formation of PXN - positive adhesions in the ﬁlopodia shaft could be a mechanism by which cells sense ma - trix alignment . In the context of stiffness sensing , ﬁlopodia tip proteins TLN1 and BCAR1 have both previously been reported to be mechanosensitive [ 36 ] . Forces exerted by individual ﬁlopo - dia typically range from 5 to 25 pN ( with a maximum potential of up to 2 nN ) and are principally mediated by actin retrograde ﬂow [ 49 – 51 ] and , upon maturation , by myosin contractility [ 52 ] . Accordingly , neither MYH9 nor MYH10 were detected within ﬁlo - podia ( Figures 1 and 2 ) . In the case of TLN1 , forces above 5 pN ( 15 pN for further activation ) can induce conformational changes that trigger a switch from talin - RIAM to talin - vinculin complexes , leading to FA stabilization [ 53 ] . In the case of BCAR1 , forces induce the stretching of the BCAR1 substrate domain , leading to its phosphorylation by SRC [ 33 ] . BCAR1 phosphorylation is not mediated by actomyosin contractility but instead depends on an intact actin cytoskeleton [ 54 ] . Importantly , here , we ( F – H ) U2OS cells expressing MYO10 - mScarlet ( F ) or MYO10 - GFP ( G and H ) were plated on ﬁbronectin - coated polyacrylamide gels of deﬁned stiffness ( 0 . 5kPa , soft ; 50 kPa , stiff ) for 2 hr .

( legend continued on next page ) 212 Current Biology 29 , 202 – 216 , January 21 , 2019 demonstrate that BCAR1 phosphorylation at ﬁlopodia tips is stiffness sensitive ( Figure 6F ) . Although the exact amount of force required to activate BCAR1 remains unknown , the BCAR1 substrate domain is disorganized , and it is likely that the weak forces mediated by actin retrograde ﬂow alone ( 5 pN in magnitude ) are sufﬁcient to mediate activation [ 54 ] . Due to the low force requirement for BCAR1 activation compared to TLN1 , it is likely that , at the ﬁlopodia tip , BCAR1 will be one of the ﬁrst mechanosensitive proteins to be activated . BCAR1 acti - vation may then lead to activation of Rap1 [ 55 , 56 ] , which would , in turn , promote talin - mediated integrin activation , adhesion re - enforcement , and ﬁlopodia stabilization . Importantly , BCAR1 - dependent ﬁlopodia stabilization functions as a feedback inhib - itor for initiation of new ﬁlopodia nucleation . Altogether , we have revealed that ﬁlopodia adhesions consist of a unique set of proteins , the ﬁlopodome , that are distinct from classical nascent adhesions , FAs , and ﬁbrillar adhesions . Our mapping will be a valuable resource for future studies aimed at unravelling the biological relevance of ﬁlopodia in different devel - opmental and pathological conditions involving cell motility and cellular responsiveness to environmental cues .

SDS – PAGE and quantitative western blotting Protein extracts were separated under denaturing conditions by SDS – PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes . Mem - branes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature with blocking buffer ( LI - COR Biosciences ) and then incubated overnight at 4 (cid:3) C with the appropriate primary antibody diluted in blocking buffer . Membranes were washed with PBS and then incubated with the appropriate ﬂuorophore - conjugated secondary antibody diluted 1 : 5 , 000 in blocking buffer for 30 min . Membranes were washed in the dark and then scanned using an Odyssey infrared imaging system ( LI - COR Biosciences ) . Band intensity was determined by digital densitometric analysis using the Odyssey software . SAMPLE PREPARATION FOR LIGHT MICROSCOPY If not indicated otherwise , cells were plated on high tolerance glass - bottom dishes ( MatTek Corporation , coverslip # 1 . 7 ) pre - coated ﬁrst with Poly - L lysine ( 10 m g / ml , 1 h at 37 (cid:3) C ) and then with bovine plasma ﬁbronectin ( 10 m g / ml , 2 h at 37 (cid:3) C ) . To generate the ﬁlopodia map , U2OS cells transiently expressing a GFP - tagged protein of interest ( POI ) and MYO10 - mScarlet were plated for 2 h on ﬁbronectin - coated glass - bottom dishes . Samples were ﬁxed and permeabilised simultaneously using a solu - tion of 4 % ( wt / vol ) PFA and 0 . 25 % ( vol / vol ) Triton X - 100 for 10 min . Cells were then washed with PBS , quenched using a solution of 1 M glycine for 30 min , and incubated with SiR - actin ( 100 nM in PBS ) at 4 (cid:3) C until imaging ( minimum length of staining , overnight at 4 (cid:3) C ; maximum length , 1 week ) . Just before imaging , samples were washed three times in PBS and mounted in vectashield ( Vectorlabs ) . Current Biology 29 , 202 – 216 . e1 – e7 , January 21 , 2019 e5 To stain endogenous proteins , U2OS cells transiently expressing MYO10 - mScarlet were plated on ﬁbronectin - coated glass - bot - tom dishes for 2h . Samples were ﬁxed and permeabilised simultaneously using a solution of 4 % ( wt / vol ) PFA and 0 . 25 % ( vol / vol ) Triton X - 100 for 10 min . Cells were then washed with PBS , quenched using a solution of 1 M glycine for 30 min , and incubated with the primary antibody for 1 h ( 1 : 100 ) . After three washes , cells were incubated with a secondary antibody for 1 h ( 1 : 100 ) . Samples were then washes three times and stored in PBS or in PBS containing an actin stain ( as indicated ) at 4 (cid:3) C until imaging . Just before imaging , samples were washed three times in PBS and mounted in vectashield ( Vectorlabs ) . For the ﬁlopodia formation assays , cells expressing human MYO10 - GFP or MYO10 - mScarlet were plated for 2 h in full medium either on glass - bottom dishes ( MatTek Corporation ) or on polyacrylamide gels of deﬁned stiffness ( Matrigen ; 0 . 5 kPa , soft , SV3510 - EC - 0 . 5 ; 50 kPa , stiff , SV3510 - EC - 50 ) precoated with ﬁbronectin ( 10 m g / ml ) . Cells were then ﬁxed using PFA , washed with PBS , permeabilized and stained using phalloidin . Images were acquired using either an SDC microscope ( 100x objective ) or an Airyscan confocal microscope ( long - working - distance 63 3 water objective ) . The number of ﬁlopodia per cell was manually scored using Fiji [ 80 , 84 ] . Filopodia length were measured automatically using a custom - made Fiji plug - in as previously described [ 15 ] . Live cell imaging All live - cell imaging experiments were performed in normal growth media , supplemented with 50 mM HEPES , at 37 (cid:3) C and in the pres - ence of 5 % CO 2 . Dynamics of PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 , PXN , TLN1 , ITGA5 and FMNL3 were recorded using an Airyscan microscope and a 40x objective . To study the role of BCAR1 in ﬁlopodia stability , U2OS cells expressing MYO10 - GFP were plated for at least 2 h on ﬁbronectin before the start of live imaging ( pictures taken every 5 s at 37 (cid:3) C , on an Airyscan microscope using a 40x objective ) . To study the role of extracellular stiffness in ﬁlopodia stability , U2OS cells expressing MYO10 - GFP were plated for at least 2 h on polyacrylamide gels of deﬁned stiffness ( Matrigen ; 0 . 5 kPa , soft , SV3510 - EC - 0 . 5 ; 50 kPa , stiff , SV3510 - EC - 50 ) precoated with ﬁbronectin ( 10 m g / ml ) before the start of live imaging ( pictures taken every 5 s at 37 (cid:3) C , on an Airyscan microscope using a long - working - distance 63 3 water objective ) . Filopodia lifetimes were then measured by identifying and tracking all MYO10 spots using the Fiji plugin TrackMate [ 81 ] . In Trackmate , the LoG detector ( estimated bob diameter = 0 . 8 m m ; threshold = 20 ; subpixel localization enabled ) and the simple LAP tracker ( linking max distance = 1 m m ; gap - closing max distance = 1 m m ; gap - closing max frame gap = 0 ) were used . Traction force microscopy ( TFM ) TFM analysis is performed by recording the position of ﬂuorescent beads that are incorporated into a deformable gel in the presence and in the absence of cells . Bead displacement is then used to calculate the amount of force generated by cells onto the substrate . Hydrogels used for TFM analyses were prepared as follows : glass - bottom dishes ( MatTek , P35G - 1 . 0 - 14 - C ) were treated with a solution of bind - silane ( Sigma - Aldrich , Silane A - 174 ) for 15 min at RT , washed once with 95 % EtOH , twice with mQH 2 O before being left to dry . A pre - mixture composed of 94 m l of 40 % acrylamide ( Sigma , A4058 ) , 50 m l of 2 % N , N 0 - Methylenebisacrylamide solution ( Sigma , M1533 ) , and 356 m l of PBS was prepared ( yielding a stiffness of (cid:4) 10kPa [ 59 ] ) . followed by addition of 3 . 4 m L of sonicated FluoSpheres ( 505 / 515 ) ( Life Technologies , F881 ) . The pre - mixture was then vortexed brieﬂy , and 1 / 500 of TEMED ( Sigma , T9281 ) and 1 / 100 APS 10 % was added immediately before 11 . 7 m L of the mixture was pipetted onto the glass plates . A round 13 mm cover - slip was carefully placed on top of the drop , ensuring that a thin layer of liquid remained between the two glass surfaces , and incu - bated for 30 min . The plate was then submerged in PBS and the glass coverslip was carefully removed . For functionalization , Sulfo - SANPAH ( Thermo Scientiﬁc , 22589 ) 0 . 2 mg / ml and N - ( 3 - Dimethylaminopropyl ) - N’ ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride ( EDC ) ( Sigma , 03450 ) 2 mg / ml in 50 mM HEPES were added onto the gels and incubated for 30 min at RT with gentle agitation . Gels were placed into a UV - chamber for 10 min without cover for polymerization , washed three times with PBS and then coated with ﬁbronectin at + 4 (cid:3) C overnight . Cells were plated onto TFM plates 2 - 4 h before the experiment . Cells were imaged live using a spinning disk confocal microscope ( long - working - distance 63 3 water objective ) . A ﬂuorescence image of the beads ( Excitation , 488 nm ; Detection , 500 – 550 nm ) and a phase - contrast image of the cells were recorded . To acquire a reference image ( beads position in absence of cells ) , cells were removed by adding 20 % SDS . Bead displacement was analyzed using a MATLAB ( MathWorks ) software package , kindly provided by Timo Betz ( University of Mu¨nster ) , that employs a correlation algorithm previously described [ 82 ] . Traction stresses were deter - mined using the same MATLAB software package following the Fourier transform traction force algorithm [ 85 ] . Microscopy setup The structured illumination microscope ( SIM ) used was DeltaVision OMX v4 ( GE Healthcare Life Sciences ) ﬁtted with a 60 3 Plan - Apochromat objective lens , 1 . 42 NA ( immersion oil RI of 1 . 516 ) used in SIM illumination mode ( ﬁve phases 3 three rotations ) . Emitted light was collected on a front illuminated pco . edge sCMOS ( pixel size 6 . 5 m m , readout speed 95 MHz ; PCO AG ) controlled by SoftWorx . The spinning disk microscope used was a Marianas spinning disk imaging system with a Yokogawa CSU - 1 scanning unit on an inverted Zeiss Axio Observer Z1 microscope controlled by SlideBook 6 ( Intelligent Imaging Innovations ) . Objectives used were a long - working - distance 63 3 water ( NA 1 . 15 water , LDC - Apochromat , M27 ) objective or a 100 3 ( NA 1 . 4 oil , Plan - Apochromat , M27 ) objective . Images were acquired using either an Orca Flash4 sCMOS camera ( chip size 2 , 048 3 2 , 048 ; Binning 2x2 enabled ; Hamamatsu Photonics ) or an Evolve 512 EMCCD camera ( chip size 512 3 512 ; Photometrics ) . e6 Current Biology 29 , 202 – 216 . e1 – e7 , January 21 , 2019 The confocal microscope used was a laser scanning confocal microscope LSM880 ( Zeiss ) equipped with an Airyscan detector ( Carl Zeiss ) . Objectives used were a long - working - distance 63 3 water ( NA 1 . 15 water , LDC - Apochromat , M27 ) or a 40x oil ( 1 . 4 ) . The microscope was controlled using Zen Black ( 2 . 3 ) and the Airyscan was used in standard super - resolution mode . Mapping of proteins within ﬁlopodia To map the localization of each POI within ﬁlopodia , images were ﬁrst processed in Fiji [ 80 ] and data analyzed using R . Brieﬂy , in Fiji , the brightness and contrast of each image was automatically adjusted using , as an upper maximum , the brightest cellular structure labeled in the ﬁeld of view . In Fiji , line intensity proﬁles ( 1 pixel width ) were manually drawn from ﬁlopodium tip to base ( deﬁned by the intersection of the ﬁlopodium and the lamellipodium ) . To avoid any bias in the analysis , the intensity proﬁle lines were drawn from a merged image of actin , MYO10 , and POI . All visible ﬁlopodia in each images were analyzed and exported for further analysis ( export was performed using the ‘‘Multi Plot’’ function ) . Data S1 contains the number of ﬁlopodia and cells analyzed for each POI . The Fiji script used to process the data is available as supplementary information ( Data S2 ) . For each POI , line intensity proﬁles were then compiled and analyzed in R . To homogenize ﬁlopodia length , each line intensity proﬁle was binned into 40 bins ( using the median value of pixels in each bin and the R function ‘‘tapply’’ ) . Using the line intensity proﬁles , the percentage of ﬁlopodia positive for each POI was quantiﬁed . A positive identiﬁcation was deﬁned as requiring at least three bins ( out of 40 ) , each with a minimum value of 10000 ( bin values between 0 - 65535 ) . The map of each POI was created by averaging hundreds of binned intensity proﬁles . The R script used to bin and average line intensity proﬁles is available as supplementary information ( Data S2 ) . The averaged binned intensity proﬁles of each POI is available in Data S2 . The ﬁlopodia maps were then displayed as heatmaps in R ( Data S2 ) . The length of each ﬁlopodia analyzed were directly extracted from the line intensity proﬁles and are plotted in Figure S1 . The preferential recruitment of core ﬁlopodia proteins to ﬁlopodia tips or shafts was assessed by calculating an enrichment ratio where the averaged intensity of a POI at ﬁlopodium tip ( bin 1 - 6 ) was divided by the averaged intensity of a POI at ﬁlopodia shaft ( bin 7 - 40 ) . This enrichment ratio was calculated for each ﬁlopodium analyzed and the results are displayed as Tukey boxplots in Figure 4 . The functional annotation analysis ( protein domain enrichments and search for known interactors ) of the core ﬁlopodia proteins was performed using the DAVID platform [ 77 ] . QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS The images used to generate the ﬁlopodia map were acquired from two independent experiments . All other experiments were repli - cated at least three times . No strategy was employed for randomization and / or stratiﬁcation . No blinding or sample - size estimations were performed at any stage of the study . No data were excluded from the analyses . The Tukey boxplots represent the median and the 25 th and 75 th percentiles ( interquartile range ) ; points are displayed as outliers ( represented by dots ) if 1 . 5 times above or below the interquartile range ( represented by whiskers ) . Boxplots were generated using the online tool BoxPlotR ( http : / / shiny . chemgrid . org / boxplotr / ) [ 78 ] . Violin plots and dot plots were generated using the online tool PlotsOfData ( https : / / huygens . science . uva . nl / PlotsOfData / ) [ 79 ] . Statistical analyses were performed when appropriate , and p values are indicated in the ﬁgure legends . Unless otherwise indi - cated , the Student’s t test was used ( unpaired , two tailed , and unequal variance , performed within LibreOfﬁce Calc ) . DATA AND SOFTWARE AVAILABILITY Representative images highlighting the subcellular localization of each protein of interest ( POI ) to generate the ﬁlopodia map are available in Data S2 . Data S2 also contains the scripts used for generating the map . Script 1 is the ImageJ macro used to measure and export the line intensity proﬁles from ﬁlopodia . Script 2 is the R code used to extract , compile , and average the line intensity pro - ﬁles previously measured in ImageJ . Script 3 is the R code used to generate the ﬁlopodia map ( using the ‘‘input table . csv’’ ﬁle ) dis - played in Figure 2 . The ‘‘input table . csv’’ ﬁle contains the numerical values used to generate the ﬁlopodia map displayed in Figure 2 . Current Biology 29 , 202 – 216 . e1 – e7 , January 21 , 2019 e7
