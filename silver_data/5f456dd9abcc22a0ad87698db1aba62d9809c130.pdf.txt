In this exceptional context a group of Israeli physicians and public health schol‑ ars ( multidisciplinary academic group on children and coronavirus [ MACC ] ) coalesced , examining the role of children in viral transmission and assessing the necessity and consequences of restricted in‑class education . Combining critical appraisal and analytical skills with public health experience , MACC advocated for safe and monitored school re‑ opening , stressing the importance of education as a determinant of health , continuously weighing this stance against evolving COVID‑19‑risk data . MACC’s activities included offering research‑based advice to government agencies including Ministries of Health , Finance , and Education . In a setting where government bodies were faced with provid‑ ing practical solutions to both decreasing disease transmission and maintaining society’s vital activities , and various advisors presented decision‑makers with disparate views , MACC contributed epidemiological , clinical and health policy expertise to the debate regarding school closure as a pandemic control measure , and adaptations required for safe re‑opening . In this paper , we describe the evolution , activities , policy inputs and media profile of MACC , and dis‑ cuss the role of academics in advocacy and activism in the midst of an unprecedented public health crisis . A general lesson learned is that academics , based on the rigor of their scientific work and their perceived objectivity , can and should be mobilized to pursue and promote policies based on shared societal values as well as empiric data , even when considerable uncertainty exists about the appropriate course of action . Mechanisms should be in place to open channels to multidisciplinary academic groups and bring their input to bear on decision‑making .

Background Competing societal needs during the coronavirus pan - demic have challenged policy - makers worldwide . Con - tinuation or cessation of essential activities ( eg . acute and preventive health services , cultural activities and commerce ) were weighed against saving lives and miti - gation measures to prevent healthcare system collapse . Around the world , decisions were made in a climate of uncertainty , governance was challenged , and public mis - trust following frequent shifts in policy were observed in many countries . The pandemic prompted a deluge of research , but scientists also took on non - traditional roles in guiding policy . School closures were among the commonest govern - mental responses to the pandemic , with Israel joining Open Access * Correspondence : hagit . hochner @ mail . huji . ac . il 1 Braun School of Public Health and Community Medicine , Hadassah Medical Organization , Faculty of Medicine , Hebrew University of Jerusalem , Jerusalem , Israel Full list of author information is available at the end of the article Page 2 of 13 Paltiel et al . Isr J Health Policy Res ( 2021 ) 10 : 48 over 100 countries in instituting this measure . However , early on , uncertainty arose regarding the role of children in transmission of SARS - CoV2 , the uniformity of disease susceptibility across age groups , alongside indications of severe social , health and economic consequences of school closures . Against this background , a multidiscipli - nary academic group ( multidisciplinary academic group on children and coronavirus - MACC ) crystallized in early April 2020 to inform policy and spur public debate on decisions affecting children in Israel . The origins of the group were fortuitous . All had been present , as audience members or presenters , at a webinar on April 13 , 2020 , where early data from the pandemic were presented . The MACC group arose following an informal email exchange immediately after this webinar , questioning reports from China suggesting a limited role of children in SARS - CoV2 transmission [ 1 ] , the publica - tion of disease models assuming uniform transmission of the virus across age groups [ 2 ] , and the appropriateness of influenza pandemic response and modelling for the current pandemic [ 3 ] . Through this correspondence all members of the group became involved in future activi - ties . One member left after approximately 2 months , one stepped away temporarily , then rejoined , and one joined after three months . The group aimed to review the available published and unpublished data regarding the role of children in the pandemic , analyze the risks and benefits of closures of educational facilities for children of all ages , advise poli - cymakers and apprise the public about these issues , thus engaging in science - based public advocacy . Main text The Pandemic in Israel Israel’s first case of COVID - 19 was documented on Feb - ruary 21 , 2020 and the first COVID - 19 - related death on March 20 , 2020 . The government took quick and drastic action to prevent transmission , morbidity and mortality , and avert a possible collapse of the healthcare system , including declaring a state of emergency , and rapid impo - sitions of lockdowns , partial border and complete school closures . Each epidemic wave elicited various intensities of government response . When detailed information about SARS - CoV2 trans - mission was still unavailable , many assumptions needed to be made . Models based on influenza and the SARS - CoV1 epidemic received early prominence in Israel and elsewhere [ 3 ] . Influenza , in contrast to COVID - 19 , is a disease in which the role of children and schools in trans - mission is important [ 4 ] . However , early school closure as an isolated epidemic control measure in the current SARS - CoV2 pandemic has not been tested rigorously for efficacy , and estimates of its potential impact show wide uncertainty , ranging from 20 to 40 % mortality reductions [ 5 ] , to provocative suggestions of mortality increases [ 6 ] . Education , health , school closures and COVID‑19 Education is not only a human right [ 7 ] , but also a major determinant of health , associated with individual [ 8 ] and country - level higher life expectancy [ 9 ] , higher child - hood vaccination [ 10 ] and cancer survival rates [ 11 ] . In many countries , the education system contributes to reducing social inequalities as well as health disparities . Although the universal right to education is undisputed , the COVID - 19 pandemic and its management have dis - proportionately disrupted children’s lives and learning opportunities . In contrast to the uncertain role of children in SARS - CoV2 transmission , the observed health effects of mas - sive school closures globally have included increased levels of domestic violence [ 12 ] , childhood obesity [ 13 ] as well as undernutrition [ 14 ] , sleep disturbances [ 15 ] , and psychological problems , mainly anxiety [ 16 ] . Moreover , school closures and the dependence on distance - learning increase educational and social gaps [ 17 ] . A modelling study in the US estimated that over 5 million years of life have been lost due to primary school closures during the pandemic [ 18 ] . Israel : education system and school closures in response to COVID‑19 ; timeline and response ( Fig . 1 ) Israel is a high - income country with the highest fertility rate per woman among OECD members [ 19 ] . Children aged ≤ 9 years comprise 19 . 7 % of the population while youth aged 10 – 19 comprise a further 16 . 4 % [ 20 ] . State - sponsored education is free from preschool at age three until completion of secondary education ( 12th grade ) . There are over 2 . 2 million children in pre - primary , pri - mary and secondary schools , most receiving their edu - cation in the governmental system with some , mainly ultraorthodox , in the private sector [ 21 ] . There are two streams divided into four sectors , three Jewish ( state , state - religious , and ultraorthodox Jewish ) and one Arab ( serving Muslim , Christian and Druze minorities ) , com - prising 43 % , 14 % , 19 % and 24 % of children , respectively [ 20 ] . School - based proficiency exams reveal educational and infrastructure deficiencies in the Israeli school sys - tem . In the OECD Program for International Student Assessment ( PISA ) 2018 , 15 year - old Israelis scored less than OECD average in reading literacy , mathematics and science , with considerable disparities among population groups [ 22 ] . Classroom crowding is also common ; public secondary schools average 29 students per class ( OECD average 23 ) [ 23 ] and many have 30 students or more [ 24 ] , Page 3 of 13 Paltiel et al . Isr J Health Policy Res ( 2021 ) 10 : 48 with physical classroom sizes smaller than recommended standards [ 24 ] . All educational facilities were closed on March 13 , 2020 , preceding a national lockdown . Subsequently , access to in - class education in Israel during the pandemic was among the lowest of OECD countries [ 25 ] , espe - cially for children in grades 5 – 10 . Social distancing and mask - wearing were inconsistently enforced . Outbreaks of COVID - 19 infection occurred sporadically in schools , including an occurrence at a Jerusalem middle and high school which began on May 26 , following an extreme heatwave , during which the requirement for masks in classrooms was waived . The outbreak , which was quickly contained , involved 153 students with PCR - confirmed SARS - CoV2 , with additional cases among teachers and family members [ 24 ] . Each epidemic wave brought increasing infections in children . The second wave was largely attributed to school reopening by the media and some Ministry of Health ( MOH ) officials . The third lockdown coincided with mass vaccination of Israelis aged 16 + . The third wave , in which the B1 . 1 . 7 variant became predominant , was characterized by especially high rates of transmis - sion to children , even during lockdown . SARS - CoV2 infections in children diminished dramatically follow - ing the mass vaccination of adults ( Fig . 2 ) . Vaccines were approved for youth aged 12 – 15 years on June 6 2021 . This corresponded to the beginning of a fourth wave , comprising mainly the delta variant , and affecting young children disproportionately , due to the fact that they are not yet vaccinated . As of 30 July 2021 , children aged 0 – 9 and youths aged 10 – 19 comprised 14 . 3 % and 21 . 2 % of the 869 , 063 confirmed coronavirus cases in Israel [ 26 ] , respectively , while 11 deaths were reported among chil - dren aged ≤ 19 , all with significant comorbidities . Public response to school closures and the origins of a public health response Public protests in Israel to lockdown and COVID - 19 - control policies focused mainly on business closures , income loss , and rarely on schools . Exceptions were some secondary students , who staged sporadic low - key demonstrations demanding a return to in - class teach - ing . Gradually , parent organizations became involved in Fig . 1 Timeline of school closure and reopening against the epidemic curve of SARS‑CoV2 infection * in the Israeli population [ 52 ] ( adapted and used with permission ) .

Isr J Health Policy Res ( 2021 ) 10 : 48 social media and media campaigns calling to resume in - class education . Throughout the crisis , there was limited involvement by academic experts in the fields of education , child psychol - ogy and sociology in the public debate concerning school re - opening . However , high - profile government advisors frequently appeared in the media , referring to children as " the engine of the pandemic " and as " super - spreaders " [ 27 ] , frequently noting that children with SARS - CoV - 2 infection were mainly asymptomatic , unidentifiable and therefore posed a threat to the community . The public debate in favor of school re - opening was spurred primarily by public health academics . As the pandemic progressed , the risks posed to children by a lack of structured learning and social interaction and the resultant threat of deepening social and health dis - parities , balanced against the generally mild effects of the disease itself , prompted MACC to take a stance advocat - ing a cautious re - opening of schools for ages 1 – 10 while monitoring disease risks . This position contrasted with the government’s dominant focus , bolstered by risk - averse advisors , on the immediate health risks posed by SARS - CoV2 , and the risks posed by children . As such , MACC’s strategy evolved from a neutral review of rel - evant scientific evidence and provision of information to policymakers and the public , to a more vigorously voiced ethical position regarding prioritizing education . This report summarizes MACC’s activities , achieve - ments in gaining access to decision - makers , igniting public debate regarding the role of children , and lessons learned during the COVID - 19 crisis in Israel . Group description The MACC group included a diverse group of physicians with specializations in Public Health , Infectious Diseases , Pediatrics , Internal Medicine , Hematology , Family Medi - cine and Geriatrics ; a biostatistician , epidemiologists , demographer , operations research analyst and health policy expert . All were teaching faculty of the Hebrew University , mainly in the Braun School of Public Health . MACC members , aged 40 – 70 , held academic ranks rang - ing from instructor to full professor . The dozen members contributed strong quantitative skills in epidemiology and biostatistics , clinical experience , and a record of con - sultation and research in health policy . Group members had taken on various professional roles during the pandemic , including community and hospital - based clinical care of COVID - 19 patients , com - munity epidemic control , COVID - related research pub - lished on a variety of pandemic - related topics [ 15 , 24 , 28 – 30 ] , among others , mortality among Jewish popula - tions worldwide , international comparison of mitigation measures in the first wave , crime statistics , public incen - tives and policing , and managing special funding for COVID - focused policy research .

Isr J Health Policy Res ( 2021 ) 10 : 48 joined other national working groups producing and ana - lyzing data . Structure and communications process There was no formal group leader ; all decisions were made by consensus . Communication within MACC was via e - mail , telephone or a closed group messaging plat - form . Relevant literature , government reports and news items were shared often just minutes after events had occurred or publicly released by government ministries . Zoom meetings were held sporadically to develop strat - egy , especially preceding meetings with stakeholders and policymakers , and to assign tasks within the group . Requests for media appearances were fielded by seven of the twelve members . Meetings with government officials , all on virtual platforms , included 2 – 8 group members . Position papers and other written documents included input and were approved by all group members . Prior to formulating recommendations , the group held consulta - tions with education experts in Israel . Outputs Table 1 outlines MACC’s advocacy activities and links to documents and activities . Narrative review In April 2020 , MACC conducted a narrative review of the current evidence of the role of children in the pandemic in four dimensions of COVID - 19 in children : severity of disease , risk of infection , risk of transmission , and the effects of school closures , both on the pandemic as well as on children . At the time little was known about the subject . Initial clinical and epidemiolog - ical evidence came mostly from China , with some data on transmission to children from Iceland and Italy [ 31 , 32 ] , an early report on school - based transmission from Australia [ 33 ] and from modeling studies . We concluded , based on the available evidence , that children , especially those aged 1 – 10 years , were less likely to experience severe COVID - 19 disease , appeared less likely to become infected than adults , were possibly less likely to transmit the disease , and that evidence suggesting that children were primary super - spreaders was lacking . Furthermore , the available literature did not provide proof that school closure was a highly effective intervention in curbing the epidemic , or that locations where primary schools had stayed open experienced major outbreaks among pupils or teachers . Data analysis The group analyzed Israeli MOH data regarding infection rates by age in children compared to adults , ( see Fig . 2 ) and also compared rates by sex and population groups ( not shown ) . Analysis revealed the rel - atively high rates of SARS - CoV2 infection in older teenag - ers , especially boys , and particularly those from the ultra - orthodox community . Position papers , meetings , letters to policymakers The findings of the narrative review , accompanied by specific recommendations , formulated after consultations with public health colleagues abroad ( US , Canada Taiwan ) were communicated to the MOH during the first wave . These included reopening preschool up to the 4rd grade in “capsules” ( small pods / bubbles ) , while ensuring staggered entry and exit times and recesses , and enforcing increased hygiene measures as well as monitoring school outbreaks and infections in teachers and students . Subsequently , numerous interactions took place between MACC and policymakers , as well as with the media , and the group became publicly known as the “ Hebrew University experts on children and COVID ” . In meetings with policy makers , generally 2 – 8 members of the MACC group were present and meeting reports or minutes were sent to the entire group . Responses to official reports MACC was asked to provide methodologic input and pre - publication comments of reports prepared by official bodies . The first was of a gov - ernment - commissioned study performed in the mainly ultra - Orthodox city of Bnei Brak on household transmis - sion of SARS - CoV2 in children [ 34 ] which showed lower relative rates of secondary transmission to and from chil - dren , even in areas of high household density with large family sizes . Secondly , MACC was invited to consult on a report on SARS - CoV2 transmission among children after school re - opening in September 2020 , prepared by the National Center for Data and Knowledge for Combating Corona , an arm of Israeli Military Intelligence . MACC’s input included data interpretation and epidemiologic guidance . In addition , the group independently appraised two important MOH reports . On 8 / 10 / 2020 a serologic study of Israelis undergoing laboratory testing in the health maintenance organizations was released [ 35 , 36 ] , report - ing a 7 % seroprevalence of IgG antibodies to SARS - CoV2 among children aged 7 – 19 , compared to 3 . 8 % overall . MACC’s critique noted that children had been under - sampled , along with critical population subgroups and geographic regions . In addition , children in the study were a biased toward a non - representative sub - group presenting to ambulatory clinics with a health complaint , whose parents agreed to have them undergo venipunc - ture . MACC concluded that the report could not be used for decision - making , since the true extent of past infec - tion in Israeli children was impossible to discern from the data .

Isr J Health Policy Res ( 2021 ) 10 : 48 Perhaps the event which defined MACC’s activist role was its response to the Israel MOH report on SARS - CoV2 morbidity and transmission in children , released publicly on 18 / 10 / 2020 [ 37 ] . The report contained some previously unreported data , including detailed descrip - tions of COVID - 19 symptoms experienced by children in various age groups , a description of super - spreader events in which children were involved , and a review of the epidemic curves by age and population group after school reopening in late August / early September . MACC’s response , while praising the wealth of detailed data , included the following critique : i . The report focused on infection risks exclusively , disregarding the toll of school closures on chil - dren’s social and mental health and development , as well as their deleterious effects on the economy and in promoting inequalities . ii . The report referred to “children” as one homog - enous entity , while the data presented clearly dem - onstrated differential COVID - 19 transmission pat - terns in young children aged 1 – 10 years , compared to teenagers , as well as by population sector . iii . Most seriously , the report concluded that chil - dren could be super - spreaders , and as such school opening presented a danger to society as a whole , provoking headlines and public fear . In fact , the MOH’s own investigations revealed that children were infected by adults more often than infecting them , and actually constituted a small percentage ( < 5 % ) of index - cases in super - spreader events . iv . As noted , the serological data , based on a nonrep - resentative sample could not be used to drive pol - icy . While welcoming the wealth of information contained in the report , MACC described its tone and conclusions “biased and tendentious” , ascribing undue responsibil - ity to children as propagators of the epidemic , rather than victims of its consequences . A press release on 21 / 10 / 2020 summarizing MACC’s critique was widely reported and prompted many media appearances ( Fig . 3 ) . One week later , the group was invited to meet with the heads of the MOH Public Health Services , Epidemiol - ogy and Child Health branches to discuss the report in detail . This meeting , but especially the media attention , appeared to represent a turning point in MOH rhetoric regarding children . Rather than “super - spreaders” they became “contributors” to disease transmission . A change in language regarding education was also noted—the “value” of education was underscored , rather than merely emphasizing the dangers of in - class learning . This change in tone was also reflected in policy , as in the third wave school closures were the last policy measure enacted , after business closures and restrictions on public gather - ings , rather than the first mitigation strategy , as had been the case in previous lockdowns . Apart from direct interaction with national ministries , MACC also provided epidemiological consultation to the Jerusalem’s municipality’s headquarters for monitoring COVID - 19 in schools , a local agency whose data man - agement systems later served as a model of " best prac - tice " for the rest of the country . Public advocacy activities i . Numerous webinars for local and , international audiences were held regarding the role of children in the COVID - 19 epidemic . Presentations were also made to physicians’ organizations and profes - sional societies . ii . International publicly accessible web - based confer - ences . The first was held on September 23 , 2020 ( https : / / huji . cloud . panop to . eu / Panop to / Pages / Viewer . aspx ? id = 30b0d 377 - 0759 - 43d8 - 8168 - ad660 0684a b8 ) , attracting both the academic community and government officials . Besides MACC partici - pants , invited speakers included a WHO represent - ative , a prominent US school health consultant , the Israeli Health and Education ministries , head of the Israel parliamentary committee for education , a local mayor , head of the national parents’ commit - tee , an academic researching the effect of school closure and online learning on children belonging to Israel’s Arab minority . The second was held on March 22 , 2021 ( https : / / huji . cloud . panop to . eu / Panop to / Pages / Viewer . aspx ? id = 1dd92 a77 - deb0 - 42a8 - 9158 - ad660 067f8 45 ) , was co - sponsored by the MACC group and the Israel Pediatrics Soci - ety , Society for Pediatric Infectious Diseases and National Council for Community Health . Invited speakers included the head of the UK Royal College of Pediatricians , and the coordinator of school pol - icy for Norway as well as Israeli pediatricians , psy - chiatrist , head of the Israel Council for the Child , and representatives of the Ministry of Health , including the director of its Public Health Services who served as discussant . iii . Media appearances ( Fig . 3 ) . MACC members gave multiple interviews in the printed press , online publications , radio and televi - sion , podcasts , and briefed numerous journalists , both local and international , including the major Israeli networks . Some contributed essays to the printed press . These “appearances” were prompted Page 9 of 13 Paltiel et al . Isr J Health Policy Res ( 2021 ) 10 : 48 either by Coronavirus - related events involving children , or followed publication and release of MACC reports and position papers via the Univer - sity’s spokesperson . Figure 3 likely under - estimates the numbers of events , since group members were also asked about children during interviews on general COVID - 19 issues , and in languages other than Hebrew and English . iv . The MACC also consulted and collaborated with other formal and informal public bodies including the Israel Pediatric Society and parents’ organiza - tions . Discussion and conclusions The role of science and scientists in crafting policy is fre - quently debated . Tension exists between the preference for an arms - length relationship between the academy and government , where science proceeds in its search for " truth " , unimpeded by the interests of politicians and partisan debate and the recognition that research pri - orities are value - laden , and cannot be dissociated from sectoral interests , including those of the scientists them - selves . Politics can influence science and the research agenda [ 38 ] . Although science is expected to provide clear answers to guide public health policy , it almost always fails , because the consequences of recommended actions are uncertain , data are “messy” , spawning legiti - mate scientific disagreements in interpretation , and val - ues are clearly implicated . An alternative , and probably more realistic expectation , is that scientists , especially public health scholars , contribute to policy according to an enlightenment model [ 39 ] , recognizing the social con - text of the knowledge they present , as well as creating the “intellectual conditions for problem solving” . In the particular context discussed herein , of chil - dren , school closures and COVID - 19 , the MACC group researched , uncovered and synthesized data , which emphasized not only case numbers , but also their mean - ings and implications for both health and the wider social context . This contrasted with messages conveyed by media and government officials that school closures were merely an economic impediment , without regard to their health consequences to children and families .

Isr J Health Policy Res ( 2021 ) 10 : 48 translated the imperfect knowledge regarding children , schools and COVID - 19 into a clear but cautious rec - ommendation to re - open schools gradually , along with appropriate monitoring and safety recommendations . In accord with the enlightenment model , MACC was able to recommend various steps needed to re - open schools safely , but it could not offer a full model of how to budget for such efforts nor enforce them . Open - ing schools , like closing them , entails risks . The group made significant public contributions by presenting the available data regarding the relative benefit of reopen - ing schools in areas of low transmission , pointing out the degree to which risks attributed to children were exaggerated , and suggesting that children were being demonized for causing viral transmission , whereas they were in essence victims of mitigation policies . All this was balanced by the recognition that COVID - 19 indeed did pose some ( albeit small ) risk to children , and that infected , asymptomatic children posed some risk to vul - nerable adults , including teachers . MACC consistently emphasized social distancing , hygiene and alleviation of school crowding as necessary public health measures , and once available , also encouraged vaccination of vul - nerable populations and teachers . The group recognized the pressures experienced by overworked and harried government officials charged with ensuring the public’s health . These officials were influenced by risk - averse advisors , while simultaneously having to answer claims by other high - profile scientists and physicians , who played down the epidemic’s dangers on various popu - lar media platforms . While sometimes opposing official government positions , MACC repeatedly offered and was called upon to assist officials with decision - making , and focused their information gathering and advocacy on a single issue ( children and schools ) , while some other ad hoc groups tended to voice general opposition to imposed measures . MACC’s positions were largely in line with statements by professional pediatrics organizations ( for example , in the UK [ 40 ] , US [ 41 ] and Israel ) relevant international bodies ( WHO [ 42 ] , Unicef [ 43 ] ) and with other academ - ics [ 44 ] , with few exceptions [ 45 ] . The eventual accept - ance by MOH officials that education is a “value” , and commitments to keep schools open despite rising SARS - CoV2 infections early in the third wave may or may not be causally attributed to MACC’s activities . Nevertheless , the fact that government bodies continue to consult with MACC , demonstrates that the group is viewed as a cred - ible and reputable source of information and counsel . Public engagement is considered a core public health activity , and scientific activism has many precedents , including during the recent drinking water disaster in Flint , Michigan [ 46 ] as well as older examples , as remote as Virchow in the nineteenth century [ 47 ] . However , academic activism is also viewed with some suspicion . Thomas Wells , a British philosopher , argued that aca - demic activism is “bad” for society , and an abuse of the trust that it holds in academics : “ In a civilized soci - ety , academic scientists are granted a special epistemic authority… This is because what they say about their sub - ject of expertise is more likely to be true than what anyone else has to say about it . Unfortunately , some academics believe they have a right—or even a duty—to exploit this privileged status … for influencing society to do what they think best [ 48 ] . ” Countering this position , Manchester University phi - losopher Anh Le wrote [ 49 ] “ In fact , many academics become activists because of what their research reveals . The nature of academic research is such that we are often in the position to come across many disturbing facts before the general public is aware of them . …When academics are in possession of these disturbing facts , it is their duty to promote these facts to the general public " … and to " fight injustice " . While the academy focused on research and the influ - ence of the COVID - 19 pandemic on education ( especially online learning ) , rare cries for academic engagement to influence policy were also heard . For instance , one uni - versity president advocated that [ 50 ] : [ academics should ] engage more closely with policy - makers and communicate our best insights to citi - zens and to the media in a clear and accessible man - ner in order to ensure that our research is informing democratic life and governance… For the most part , members of the MACC group had not previously engaged in direct public health activ - ism , other than in serving as members of government - appointed committees , or writing occasional op - eds or position papers . The COVID - 19 crisis , described here , thus represented a paradigm change for MACC mem - bers : integrating their critical appraisal , data analysis and interpretation skills , and translating them into a clear ethical stance . This stance was informed by evidence , not merely on infection rates , but rather a holistic concept of health and a balanced view of risk . There are a variety of lessons learned from the MACC experience . These include the recognition that training , experience and expertise arising from various disciplines , from community and hospital practice , from non - medi - cal disciplines , and from age and gender diversity within the group , provide added value to decision - making in the face of uncertainty . The iterative and interactive process of rigorously examining the data available , both published and unpublished , by individuals from different profes - sional backgrounds provided a fresh , broad perspective , Page 11 of 13 Paltiel et al . Isr J Health Policy Res ( 2021 ) 10 : 48 perhaps less hampered by the “common wisdom” of each discipline , respectively . This multidisciplinary approach could serve as a model for inclusiveness and responsive - ness of decision - makers , even between crises . Indeed , the group was generally well - received both by the media and by decision makers , even when in incomplete agreement with MACC’s recommendations . The cautious approach characterizing MACC’s appear - ances in the media , with consistent messages based on examination of the evidence , could serve public health students in their training regarding advocacy . MACC’s activities were expedited by the relatively few ‘degrees of separation’ that typify Israeli society , enabling access to policymakers and the media . This lack of formality enhanced the group’s efforts and influence , and should facilitate future activism by academic groups , including public health professionals . However , barriers to this type of engagement may exist in countries with more struc - tured and formal hierarchies . Nevertheless , a general lesson learned is that academics , based on the rigor of their scientific work and their perceived objectivity , can and should be mobilized to pursue and promote policies based on shared societal values as well as empiric data , even when considerable uncertainty exists about the appropriate course of action in a crisis . For policy makers the lessons are even more impor - tant . Even during times of crisis there is opportunity to scan the policy landscape to seek and encourage groups in academia that may have the capacity for , and may have already begun to engage in multidisciplinary policy work relevant to decisions being made in real time . Mecha - nisms should be in place to open channels to such groups and bring their input to bear on decision - making . In this type of public health crisis ( which is not expected to be the last of its kind ) authorities have a dual responsibility : both to provide guidance and mitiga - tion measures , and to generate local data and informa - tion and integrate it into the global surveillance network . Faced with a novel disease , the benefits of sharing data as widely as possible are self - evident , but widening the cir - cle for analysis and interpretation of these data are less accepted , challenging the standard mode of operation of government agencies . It can be expected that future post - COVID - 19 public health crises will generate similar or greater levels of public - scientific engagement , and mech - anisms should be developed to harness this rather than regard it as confrontational . MACC’s activist approach is in keeping with the “all hands on deck” ethos of national , international and inter - sectoral collaboration to address COVID - 19 and its consequences [ 51 ] . To paraphrase Hippocrates , “ Des - perate times call for desperate measures ” . The COVID crisis generated an unusual multidimensional and mul - tidisciplinary collaboration , thrusting a group of Israeli academics into an activist role , influencing policy while continuously monitoring the basis of their recommenda - tions . As the pandemic unfolds , the role of children will eventually be clarified , but only by hindsight . COVID - 19 presented a need for informed action before the dust settled . Advocating for the educational rights of children in the health context is only a part of ensuring a secure future for Israel’s post - COVID society . Future tasks include upgrading both the infrastructure and educational qual - ity of the school system itself . The considerable chal - lenges facing the system , even before the pandemic struck , belie Israel’s image as a “high tech” nation . Now more than ever , Israeli society must strive to make the necessary sustainable changes in order to promote the physical , mental and social welfare of its children .
