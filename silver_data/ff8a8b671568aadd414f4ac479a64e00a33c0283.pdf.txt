The mechanism of interaction with proﬁlin was unknown but was hypothesized to be mediated by either Arp2 or Arp3 . Here we show that the Arp2 subunit of the complex can be chemically cross - linked to the actin - binding site of proﬁlin . By analytical ultracentrifugation , rhodamine - labeled proﬁlin binds Arp2 / 3 complex with a K d of 7 m M , an afﬁnity intermediate between the low afﬁnity of proﬁlin for barbed ends of actin ﬁlaments and its high afﬁnity for actin monomers . These data suggest the barbed end of Arp2 is exposed , but Arp2 and Arp3 are not packed together in the complex exactly like two actin monomers in a ﬁlament . Arp2 / 3 complex also cross - links actin ﬁlaments into small bundles and isotropic networks , which are mechanically stiffer than solutions of actin ﬁlaments alone . Arp2 / 3 complex is concentrated at the leading edge of motile Acanthamoeba , and its localization is distinct from that of a - actinin , another ﬁlament cross - linking protein . Based on localization and actin ﬁlament nucleation and cross - linking activities , we propose a role for Arp2 / 3 in determining the structure of the actin ﬁlament network at the leading edge of motile cells . INTRODUCTION Active motility and passive mechanical properties of eukaryotic cells depend on the actin cytoskeleton . Mo - tile cells move across a substrate using actin polymer - ization to drive membrane protrusion at the leading edge ( Tilney et al . , 1981 ; Wang , 1985 ) . Adherent cells transmit forces between sites of attachment via bun - dles and orthogonal networks of cross - linked actin ﬁlaments . Even nonmotile cells such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe rely on actin ﬁlaments to transport cellular components and to complete cell division . Despite our detailed under - standing of actin biochemistry and the impressive cat - alog of known actin - binding proteins , a fundamental question remains unanswered : How exactly do eu - karyotic cells control the organization of the actin cytoskeleton ? To move or even to change shape , cells must somehow regulate , both spatially and tempo - rally , the de novo nucleation of actin ﬁlaments as well as their organization into higher order structures such as bundles or isotropic networks . One potentially important regulator of cytoskeletal organization is the Arp2 / 3 complex , a seven - subunit protein complex ﬁrst identiﬁed by proﬁlin afﬁnity chromatography ( Machesky et al . , 1994 ) . The complex is composed of two actin - related proteins , Arp2 and Arp3 , and ﬁve novel proteins , p40 , p35 , p19 , p18 , and p14 . Five lines of evidence implicate Arp2 / 3 complex in regulation of the actin cytoskeleton . ( 1 ) The complex is ubiquitous and essential . The genes for Arp2 and Arp3 are highly conserved across eukaryotic phyla , appar - ently as ancient as actin and essential in both budding and ﬁssion yeast ( for recent reviews see Frankel and Mooseker , 1996 ; Mullins et al . , 1996 ; Machesky , 1997 ) . This is not true for many proteins associated with the actin cytoskeleton , which appear to have overlapping or nonessential functions . ( 2 ) The Arp2 / 3 complex is directly associated with the actin cytoskeleton . In Acanthamoeba , Arp2 / 3 complex binds to and decorates † Corresponding author . © 1998 by The American Society for Cell Biology 841 the sides of actin ﬁlaments ( Mullins et al . , 1997 ) , and in sea urchin egg extracts the complex binds F - actin af - ﬁnity columns and cosediments with actin ﬁlaments ( Terasaki et al . , 1997 ) . The complex also sediments with the cytoskeletal fraction after lysis of human platelets ( Welch et al . , 1997a ) . In vivo Arp2 / 3 complex is localized to actin - rich regions , especially the leading edges of motile cells and the actin - rich comet tails of Listeria monocytogenes ( Machesky et al . , 1994 ; Kelleher et al . , 1995 ; Mullins et al . , 1997 , Welch et al . , 1997a , 1997b ) as well as to actin - rich cortical patches in S . pombe and S . cerevisiae ( Balasubramanian et al . , 1996 ; Moreau et al . , 1996 ; Winter et al . , 1997 ) . ( 3 ) Arp2 / 3 com - plex interacts with the actin - regulatory protein , proﬁlin . In vitro the complex binds proﬁlin afﬁnity columns and in S . pombe , homologs of Arp3 and p40 interact geneti - cally with proﬁlin ( Machesky et al . , 1994 ; Balasubrama - nian et al . , 1996 ; McCollum et al . , 1996 ) . ( 4 ) In S . cerevisiae Arp3 function is required for proper organization and motility of cortical actin patches ( Moreau et al . , 1996 ; Winter et al . , 1997 ) and for the internalization step of endocytosis ( Moreau et al . , 1997 ) . ( 5 ) Along with partially puriﬁed mammalian cytoskeletal extracts , Arp2 / 3 com - plex is sufﬁcient to reconstitute actin - based Listeria mo - tility ( Welch et al . , 1997a ) . Based on structural arguments , Kelleher et al . ( 1995 ) suggested that the Arp2 / 3 complex might nucleate de novo assembly of actin ﬁlaments . Welch et al . ( 1997a ) invoked such a nucleation activity to account for the ability of Arp2 / 3 complex to induce the formation of actin clouds around Listeria cells . And recently we demonstrated that Arp2 / 3 complex from Acan - thamoeba tightly caps the pointed ends of actin ﬁla - ments and nucleates formation of ﬁlaments that grow from their barbed ends ( Mullins and Pollard , unpub - lished data ) . These data suggest that the Arp2 / 3 com - plex plays an important role in initiating polymeriza - tion of actin at the leading edge of motile cells . Here we show that proﬁlin binds the Arp2 / 3 complex by direct interaction with the Arp2 subunit . This is the ﬁrst demonstration of direct binding between an actin - related protein and a conventional actin - binding pro - tein , and it supports the idea of Kelleher et al . ( 1995 ) that surfaces on the barbed end of conventional actin are conserved on Arp2 and exposed at the surface of the Arp2 / 3 complex . We also show that in vitro Arp2 / 3 organizes actin ﬁlaments into small bundles and orthogonal networks of the type seen at the lead - ing edges of motile cells , suggesting that the Arp2 / 3 complex not only regulates actin polymerization but also ﬁlament organization at the leading edge . MATERIALS AND METHODS Protein Puriﬁcation We puriﬁed Arp2 / 3 complex from Acanthamoeba : extract by both poly - L - proline afﬁnity chromatography and by conventional col - umn chromatography essentially as previously described ( Ma - chesky et al . , 1994 ; Mullins et al . , 1997 ) with some modiﬁcations . Cells were homogenized in either pyrophosphate extraction buffer as described before ( Lynch et al . , 1991 ; Machesky et al . , 1994 ) or sucrose extraction buffer ( 10 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 , 11 . 6 % sucrose , 1 mM EGTA , 1 mM ATP , 1 mM dithiothreitol ( DTT ) , 0 . 1 mM benza - midine , 2 mg / l leupeptin , 20 mg / l soybean trypsin inhibitor , and 10 mg / l pepstatin A ) . For preparations using sucrose extraction , the extract was not dialyzed against a low - salt pyrophosphate buffer but was loaded directly onto diethylaminoethyl ( DEAE ) - cellulose equilibrated with 10 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 5 mM DTT , 0 . 5 mM ATP , 0 . 5 mM phenylmethylsulfonylﬂuoride , and 0 . 1 mM benzamidine ( Tseng et al . , 1984 ) . For both sucrose and phos - phate extraction procedures , ﬂow - through from the DEAE - cellulose column was collected and loaded onto poly - L - proline Sepharose ( Kaiser et al . , 1989 ) . Arp2 / 3 complex was eluted from the poly - L - proline Sepharose with 0 . 4 M MgCl 2 in 10 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 100 mM NaCl , 100 mM glycine , and 1 mM DTT . Proﬁlin was subsequently eluted with 8 M urea . Puriﬁcation of Arp2 / 3 complex by ion exchange chromatography was modiﬁed from the method originally used by Machesky et al . ( 1994 ) . Brieﬂy , the DEAE ﬂow - through was adjusted to pH 6 . 0 by the addition of solid 2 - [ N - morpholino ] ethanesulfonic acid ( MES ) and loaded onto P - 11 phosphocellulose ( PC ) ( Whatman , Maidstone , England ) equilibrated with 25 mM MES , pH 6 . 0 . The PC column was washed with 300 mM NaCl and eluted with 500 mM NaCl . Peak fractions were pooled , concentrated , and chromatographed in 300 mM NaCl on a Sephacryl S - 300 gel ﬁltration column . The Arp - containing pool from this column was then diluted to a ﬁnal NaCl concentration of 100 mM and loaded onto a Mono - S FPLC column ( Pharmacia Biotech , Piscataway , NJ ) . The ﬂow - through from this column , containing the majority of the Arp2 / 3 complex , was loaded onto hydroxyapatite Bio - Gel HT ( Bio - Rad , Hercules , CA ) , and the complex was eluted with 100 mM sodium pyrophos - phate and 100 mM NaCl . For storage , puriﬁed Arp2 / 3 complex was dialyzed into 10 mM imidazole ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 150 mM NaCl , 0 . 2 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM ATP , and 1 . 0 mM dithiothreitol , concentrated by dialysis against solid su - crose , and stored on ice . Acanthamoeba actin was puriﬁed from DEAE column fractions by polymerization - depolymerization and gel ﬁltration ( Pollard , 1984 ) . Rabbit skeletal muscle actin was puriﬁed from acetone powder by the method of Spudich and Watt ( 1971 ) followed by gel ﬁltration ( MacLean - Fletcher and Pollard , 1980 ) . Chemical Cross - linking The zero - length chemical cross - linker 1 - ethyl - 3 - ( 3 - dimethylamin - opropyl ) - carbodiimide hydrochloride ( EDC ) , along with N - hy - droxysuccinimide ( NHS ) were obtained from Pierce ( Rockford , IL ) . Stock solutions ( 20 3 ) were made fresh in dry dimethylsulfoxide ( DMSO ) immediately before use . Final concentration of DMSO in all reactions was # 10 % . Reactions were carried out for 1 h at room temperature . Preparation of Fluorescently - labeled Proteins Acanthamoeba actin was labeled with pyrene iodoacetamide ( Pol - lard , 1984 ) . Acanthamoeba proﬁlin - II mutants N58C and S38C were labeled with rhodamine maleimide ( Vinson , De La Cruz , Kaiser , Higgs , Pollard , unpublished data ) . Proﬁlin Binding by Equilibrium Ultracentrifugation We did equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation in a Beckman model XL - A ultracentrifuge . We loaded samples containing rhoda - mine - labeled proﬁlin - II into six - hole , charcoal - ﬁlled Epon center - pieces and centrifuged them to equilibrium ( at least 20 h at each speed ) in a Beckman model An60ti rotor . We monitored absorption R . D . Mullins et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 842 at 550 nm , a wavelength speciﬁc for the rhodamine - label and col - lected data sets every hour . To monitor the approach to equilibrium we calculated total root mean square ( RMS ) deviation of each data set from the ﬁnal data set collected using the program MATCH ( Jeff Lary , National Analytical Ultracentrifuge Facility , Storrs CT ) . We considered experiments to have reached equilibrium when there was no change in RMS deviation of consecutive data sets . We parsed the data from individual samples into separate data sets using the program REEDIT ( Jeff Lary , National Analytical Ultracen - trifuge Facility ) . Absorption optics allow us to selectively monitor labeled proﬁlin in the presence of other proteins , to determine directly the distribu - tions of free and bound proﬁlin , and to calculate equilibrium bind - ing constants ( Schachman , 1960 ; Schachman et al . , 1962 ) . A similar method has been used previously to measure equilibrium binding of pyrene - labeled actobindin to actin ( Bubb et al . , 1994 ) . First we ﬁt each data set to a sum of two exponential functions by linear least squares methods P 0 e s p S r 2 2 2 r m2 2 D 1 P 1 e s pa S r 2 2 2 r m2 2 D where P o and P 1 are the ﬁtting constants to be determined , r is radial position , r m is the radius of the meniscus , and s p and s pa are the effective reduced molecular weights of proﬁlin alone and proﬁlin bound to Arp2 / 3 complex or to actin monomers . The effective reduced molecular weight is deﬁned as s 5 M v 2 ( 1 2 v r ) RT where M is molecular mass ( g / mol ) , v is the angular velocity ( rad / sec ) , v is the partial speciﬁc volume ( cm 3 / gm ) , r is the solvent density ( gm / cm 3 ) , R is the gas constant , and T is the absolute temperature ( K ) . From these ﬁts we determined the total amounts of free and bound proﬁlin by P free 5 E r m r b P 0 e s p S r 2 2 2 r m2 2 D dr P bound 5 E r m r b P 1 e s pa S r 2 2 2 r m2 2 D dr Where r m and r b are the radii of the meniscus and the bottom of the sample cell . The total amount of proﬁlin is simply the sum of the bound and free . The total amount of Arp2 / 3 complex or actin can be calculated from the relative loading concentration . P total 5 P free 1 P bound A total 5 C r P total Where C r is the ratio of the initial Arp2 / 3 complex or actin concen - tration to the initial proﬁlin concentration . For a stoichiometry of 1 : 1 , the amount of bound proﬁlin will equal the amount of bound Arp2 / 3 complex or actin and we calculate the distribution of free Arp2 / 3 or actin A 0 e s a S r 2 2 2 r m2 2 D from A 0 5 ( A total 2 P bound ) 3 E r m r b e s a S r 2 2 2 r m2 2 D dr 4 2 1 The dissociation equilibrium constant is then given by K d 5 A 0 P 0 P 1 It is apparent from the formulas above that the accuracy of this method depends on accurate determination of both the ﬁtting pa - rameters P 0 and P 1 as well as the positions of the meniscus and base of the sample cell . The position of the meniscus is marked by a spike in the data set and can be assigned with conﬁdence . We added a small amount of a dense imiscible liquid ( usually carbon tetrachlo - ride ) to each sample chamber to form a ﬂat base , perpendicular to the direction of centrifugation , so the exact position of the bottom of the sample column was less obvious . For our calculation we chose the base of each sample chamber to satisfy conservation of mass according to the following equation [ P ] 0 5 E r m r b P 0 e s p S r 2 2 2 r m2 2 D 1 P 1 e s pa S r 2 2 2 r m2 2 D dr Where [ P ] 0 is the initial baseline concentration of labeled proﬁlin in the sample cell at time t 5 0 . Rheometry Rheological measurements were made with a cone and plate Rheo - metrics rheometer ( Rheometrics Inc . , Piscataway , NJ ) in the small amplitude ( strain # 2 % ) , forced oscillation mode ( Sato et al . , 1984 ) . Arp2 / 3 complex in KME buffer ( 50 mM KCl , 10 mM imidazole , pH 7 . 0 , 1 mM EGTA , and 1 mM MgCl 2 ) was mixed with actin in Buffer G [ 2 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 8 . 0 ) , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 5 mM DTT , and 1 mM NaN 3 ] , polymerized by adding one - tenth volume of 10 3 KME and immediately placed between the metal plates of the rheometer to polymerize at 25°C . The plates were kept in a water - saturated chamber to prevent sample dehydration . Measurements of G 9 and G 0 were made every 30 s using time sweep mode to observe the gel formation . After G 9 and G 0 reached a plateau , frequency sweep mode was used to measure the rheological param - eters : the value of complex modulus u G * u , where u G * u 5 ( G’ 2 1 G“ 2 ) 1 / 2 ; and the phase shift d , where d 5 tan – 1 ( G” / G’ ) ( Ferry , 1980 ) . Electron Microscopy Acanthamoeba actin ﬁlaments in the presence and absence of Arp2 / 3 complex were negatively stained with freshly prepared 1 % uranyl formate ( Aebi et al . , 1981 ) . Other samples were ﬁxed , embedded , and sectioned ( Maciver et al . , 1991 ) . Acanthamoeba actin ( 10 m M ) was polymerized in the presence or absence of 1 m M Arp2 / 3 complex in a 50 m l volume on a porcelain tray in a humid chamber for 1 h at 24°C . Samples were overlaid with 1 % glutaraldehyde and 2 mg / ml tannic acid in 100 mM sodium phosphate , pH 7 . 0 , 50 mM KCl , and 5 mM MgCl 2 for 30 min at 24°C , washed with 100 mM sodium phosphate , pH 7 . 0 , and then with 100 mM sodium phosphate , pH 6 . 0 , ﬁxed again with 0 . 1 % OsO 4 in 100 mM sodium phosphate , pH 6 . 0 , at 24°C for 30 min , and then dehydrated with an ethanol series and embedded in Epon for thin sectioning . All micrographs were made at 80 kV with a JEOL JEM100CX or a Zeiss 10A electron microscope ( Carl Zeiss , Thornwood , NY ) at nominal magniﬁcations between 23 , 000 3 and 46 , 000 3 . Actual magniﬁcation was deter - mined by calibration with tropomyosin paracrystals . Negative im - ages were scanned digitally and prepared for presentation using Adobe Photoshop . Monoclonal Antibodies Mouse monoclonal antibodies against Acanthamoeba proﬁlin ( Kaiser and Pollard , 1996 ) and Acanthamoeba a - actinin ( Kaiser , Sato , Karaki , and Pollard , unpublished ) were prepared by standard methods ( Kiehart et al . , 1984 ) . Arp2 / 3 Complex Vol . 9 , April 1998 843 Fluorescence Microscopy Acanthamoeba were maintained and ﬁxed as previously described ( Yonemura and Pollard , 1992 ) . Cells were incubated with rabbit polyclonal antisera speciﬁc for Acanthamoeba Arp2 , Arp3 ( Kelleher , et al . , 1995 ) , p40 , or p35 ( Mullins et al . , 1997 ) or mouse monoclonal antibodies speciﬁc for Acanthamoeba a - actinin , for 1 h at 24°C . Pre - absorbed ( Yonemura and Pollard , 1992 ) Cy - 3 conjugated goat anti - rabbit IgG secondary antibody ( Amersham , Arlington Heights , IL ) was applied for 30 min . BODIPY - FL phallicidin ( Molecular Probes , Sunnyvale , CA ) was used to label ﬁlamentous actin . Cells were mounted in 50 % glycerol containing 20 mM DTT and 5 . 6 mM p - phenylenediamine . We observed and photographed labeled cells using both phase - contrast and ﬂuorescence microscopy as described previously ( Fujiwara and Pollard , 1976 ) . Figures were prepared using Adobe Photoshop from digitally scanned 35 - mm negatives . RESULTS Proﬁlin Binds the Arp2 Subunit of the Arp2 / 3 Complex By optimizing conditions we were able to cross - link both proﬁlin - I and proﬁlin - II to the Arp2 / 3 complex using the zero - length cross - linker EDC with NHS . At 20 m M proﬁlin and 3 m M Arp2 / 3 , EDC / NHS pro - duces two new bands on SDS - PAGE of 56 kDa and 59 kDa that react with antibodies against Acanthamoeba proﬁlin ( Figure 1A ) . Proﬁlin - I and proﬁlin - II produced identical sets of bands . Both bands react with anti - Arp2 antibodies but not with antibodies to Arp3 or any other member of the complex ( Figure 1B ) . We conclude that the two bands are two different het - erodimers of Arp2 and proﬁlin , cross - linked at differ - ent residues and with slightly different mobilities on SDS - PAGE gels . Under other conditions , chemical cross - linking agents that covalently cross - link actin to proﬁlin fail to cross - link proﬁlin to any subunit of Arp2 / 3 complex ( Mullins et al . , 1997 ) . A panel of monoclonal antibodies to proﬁlin reveals that the 56 - kDa product is similar to the proﬁlin - actin complex cross - linked by EDC / NHS . EDC / NHS cross - links E364 of Acanthamoeba actin to K115 of Acan - thamoeba proﬁlin - I or proﬁlin - II ( Vandekerchove et al . , 1989 ) . This binding site has been studied with the aid of four epitope - mapped monoclonal anti - proﬁlin an - tibodies , P4 , P5 , P6 and P7 ( Kaiser and Pollard , 1996 ) . P5 and P7 bind proﬁlin near K115 , and cross - linking proﬁlin to actin by EDC / NHS blocks binding of both antibodies ( Kaiser and Pollard , 1996 ) . Antibodies P4 and P6 bind to different regions of proﬁlin and still recognize proﬁlin cross - linked to actin . All four anti - bodies recognize the upper band , but only P4 and P6 react with the 56 - kDa band ( Figure 2 ) . P5 and P7 both Figure 1 . EDC with NHS cross - links Acanthamoeba proﬁlin to the Arp2 subunit of the Arp2 / 3 complex .

Figure 2 . Arp2 binds at or near the actin - binding site on proﬁlin . Immunoblot of SDS - PAGE of proﬁlin - II cross - linked to Arp2 / 3 complex with EDC / NHS and probed with four epitope - mapped , monoclonal anti - proﬁlin antibodies , P4 , P5 , P6 , and P7 . Antibodies P4 and P6 bind free proﬁlin and proﬁlin cross - linked to actin by EDC / NHS . Both also react with the two Arp2 - proﬁlin cross - linked products . P5 and P7 bind free proﬁlin but not proﬁlin cross - linked to actin and do not bind the smaller of the two Arp2 - proﬁlin cross - linked products . Conditions as in Figure 1 . R . D . Mullins et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 844 fail to recognize this band . We conclude that the lower band is Arp2 cross - linked to proﬁlin at or near K115 , in the actin - binding site of proﬁlin . The upper band is a distinct cross - linked product of Arp2 and proﬁlin with a different mobility on SDS - PAGE in which Arp2 is probably cross - linked to a residue of proﬁlin other than K115 . The presence of this product does not necessarily suggest two binding sites for proﬁlin on Arp2 but rather the proximity of another cross - link - able residue of proﬁlin to a residue on Arp2 that is not conserved on conventional actin . Proﬁlin Binds Actin More Strongly than the Arp2 / 3 Complex We used sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifuga - tion to determine the afﬁnity of proﬁlin - II for actin and Arp2 / 3 complex . To measure the concentration of proﬁlin in the presence of actin or Arp2 / 3 complex , we labeled proﬁlin - II mutants in which either serine - 38 or asparagine - 58 was replaced by cysteine ( S38C and N58C proﬁlin - II ) with rhodamine maleim - ide . Actin and poly - L - proline binding of these rhoda - mine - labeled constructs is indistinguishable from that of unlabeled proﬁlin ( Vinson , De La Cruz , Kaiser , Higgs , and Pollard , unpublished data ) . At equilib - rium , both rhodamine - labeled mutants form exponen - tial gradients characteristic of single , homogeneous , and thermodynamically ideal species . For N58C we calculated a native molecular weight of 12 , 930 Da , close to the value of 13 , 045 Da deduced from amino acid sequence . Measuring the distribution of labeled proﬁlin in the presence of actin or Arp2 / 3 complex by absorbance at 550 nm gave a signal equal to the sum of the absor - bances of bound and free proﬁlin . We determined equilibrium dissociation constants for proﬁlin binding actin and Arp2 / 3 complex by least - squares ﬁtting of the equilibrium distribution of labeled proﬁlin to a sum of two distributions , one determined by the ef - fective reduced molecular weight of proﬁlin alone ( s p ) and the other by that of proﬁlin bound to the larger protein ( s pa ) . We measured the effective reduced mo - lecular weights of proﬁlin , actin , and Arp2 / 3 complex individually , at the same speeds and in the same buffers used in the binding experiments and used these values in curve ﬁtting . We independently calcu - lated and averaged equilibrium dissociation constants from six data sets at three different protein concentra - tions spun at two speeds . By this method N58C proﬁlin - II binds Ca 2 1 - ATP Acanthamoeba actin monomers with a K d of 0 . 92 6 1 . 0 m M ( n 5 6 , Figure 3A ) and Arp2 / 3 complex with a K d of 7 . 4 6 0 . 5 m M ( n 5 6 , Figure 3B ) . The conditions differed in these two experiments . A low - ionic strength buffer was used in the actin binding experi - ments to keep actin monomers from polymerizing , while 150 mM NaCl was used in the Arp2 / 3 binding experiment to keep the complex from aggregating . The large uncertainty in the actin experiment arises from the fact that the concentration of proﬁlin needed for detection ( 5 m M ) is well above the K d of the inter - action . Similar results were obtained with the S38C mutant , indicating that the speciﬁc cysteine mutations and rhodamine labeling do not alter the binding to Arp2 / 3 complex . Arp2 / 3 Complex Cross - links and Bundles Actin Filaments Previously we found that Arp2 / 3 complex binds to the sides of actin ﬁlaments ( Mullins et al . , 1997 ) and hypothesized that it could cross - link ﬁlaments into networks or bundles . Preliminary experiments showed that Arp2 / 3 complex pellets with actin ﬁla - ments under centrifugal forces where actin ﬁlaments alone do not pellet ( our unpublished results ) . We char - acterized these higher order structures by quantitative rheometry and electron microscopy . By quantitative rheometry , Arp2 / 3 complex in - creases the stiffness of solutions of actin ﬁlaments in a concentration - dependent manner ( Figure 4 ) . Addition of Arp2 / 3 complex increases the complex modulus , u G * u —a measure of stiffness , and decreases the phase shift , d —a measure of ﬂuid - or solid - like behavior ( Figure 4B ) . In these assays , d 5 0 radians for a solid and d 5 1 . 6 radians for a Newtonian ﬂuid . Viscoelastic materials like actin ﬁlaments have intermediate values of d . In the presence of Arp2 / 3 complex , actin ﬁlaments form networks of individual ﬁlaments and bundles of ﬁlaments that are visible in electron micrographs of thin sections of samples imbedded in Epon and of samples adsorbed to EM grids and negatively stained with 1 % uranyl formate ( Figure 5 ) . Pure actin ﬁla - ments have a low tendency to associate , and the den - sity of individual ﬁlaments in thin sections of actin ﬁlaments alone is quite uniform . Actin ﬁlament net - works in the presence of Arp2 / 3 complex are quite heterogeneous in thin sections cut from a single sam - ple . Individual ﬁlaments are visible , but many are aggregated into bundles containing ( within the thick - ness of the section ) two to eight ﬁlaments . Individual ﬁlaments appear to fray off the ends of these bundles , and some appear to run from one bundle to another . Bundles tend to associate over a wide range of angles from nearly parallel to perpendicular and are studded with 10 - nm particles not seen in samples of pure actin ﬁlaments or in bundles induced by a - actinin ( Wach - sstock et al . , 1993b ) . The size of these particles is con - sistent with the low resolution structure of the com - plex determined by electron microscopy of rotary shadowed samples ( Mullins et al . , 1997 ) . There was no Arp2 / 3 Complex Vol . 9 , April 1998 845 obvious periodicity in the association of Arp2 / 3 com - plex with the ﬁlament bundles . The Distributions of Arp2 / 3 Complex and a - Actinin Differ in Motile Cells Arp2 / 3 and a - actinin are both concentrated in cortical regions of Acanthamoeba castellanii , but the leading edge is enriched in Arp2 / 3 complex compared with a - actinin ( Figure 6 ) . As noted before ( Kelleher et al . , 1995 ; Mullins et al . , 1997 ) , the staining for Arp2 / 3 complex members in Acanthamoeba is concentrated at the leading edge of the cells where it has a distinctly ﬁbrillar character . In contrast , a - actinin is enriched in peripheral , cortical regions of the cell that do not stain well for Arp2 / 3 complex subunits . In the regions where it is most enriched , a - actinin staining extends out to the plasma membrane but lacks the ﬁbrillar character of Arp2 / 3 staining . At the leading edge , a - actinin staining becomes weak and diffuse ( as in the panels on the lower right of Figure 6 , costained for p35 ) , or is undetectable ( panels on the upper left of Figure 6 , costained for Arp3 ) . Even in cells with diffuse staining near the leading edge , a - actinin does not extend to the tip of the leading edge like Arp2 / 3 complex . The localizations of Arp2 / 3 and a - actinin overlap most frequently at the rear of the cell , directly opposite the leading edge ( Figure 6 , especially lower right panel ) . Arp2 / 3 subunits , Arp3 , Arp2 , p40 , and p35 , are also more abundant in the central cytoplasm than a - actinin . DISCUSSION Proﬁlin Binding From its discovery , Arp2 / 3 complex has been as - sumed to bind proﬁlin , since it can be puriﬁed by afﬁnity chromatography directly on proﬁlin - agarose and indirectly on poly - L - proline Sepharose ( Machesky et al . , 1994 ) . By analogy with actin , proﬁlin was as - sumed to bind one of the actin - related proteins . The Figure 3 .

Residuals are shown in the lower panels . Conditions were as follows . Buffer : 150 mM NaCl , 0 . 2 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 1 mM ATP , 10 mM imidazole , pH 7 . 5 . Temperature : 25°C . Arp2 / 3 complex was puriﬁed by proﬁlin : poly - L - proline afﬁnity chromatography . R . D . Mullins et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 846 proﬁlin - binding site of actin is more conserved in structural models of Arp2 than of Arp3 ( Kelleher et al . , 1995 ) . In line with these predictions , we ﬁnd that EDC / NHS cross - links both proﬁlin - I and proﬁlin - II to Arp2 but not to Arp3 . With either proﬁlin - I or proﬁlin - II EDC / NHS pro - duces two cross - linked proﬁlin - Arp2 conjugates with slightly different mobilities on SDS - PAGE gels . Reac - tion of these cross - linked products with a panel of epitope - mapped , anti - proﬁlin monoclonal antibodies shows that the 56 - kDa product is similar to proﬁlin cross - linked to actin - E364 by EDC , because cross - linked Arp2 blocks binding of two antibodies with epitopes in the actin - binding site , just like cross - linked actin ( Kaiser and Pollard , 1996 ) . We conclude that Arp2 contacts the actin - binding site of proﬁlin . In cross - linking experiments there was no detectable dif - ference between proﬁlin - I and proﬁlin - II . Arp1 ﬁla - ments are thought to bind spectrin ( Holleran et al . , 1996 ) , but ours is the ﬁrst direct experimental evidence that an Arp binds to the actin - binding site of a con - ventional actin - binding protein . Since the proﬁlin binding site on actin is located at the barbed end of the subunit , the barbed end of Arp2 is probably exposed on the surface of the complex . By sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation , rhodamine - proﬁlin - II binds Arp2 / 3 with a K d of 7 . 4 m M . This method yielded a K d for proﬁlin binding to actin of 0 . 9 m M . Under similar conditions , using ﬂuo - rescence anisotropy , Vinson and Pollard ( unpublished data ) measured a K d of 0 . 2 m M for the same rhoda - mine - labeled proﬁlin mutant binding to Acanthamoeba Ca 2 1 - ATP - actin . By both measurements the afﬁnity of proﬁlin for conventional actin monomers is at least 10 times higher than for Arp2 / 3 complex . The dissocia - tion rate constant of proﬁlin from actin is 4 s 2 1 ( Vin - son , DeLaCruz , Kaiser , Higgs , and Pollard , unpub - lished data ) , so we predict that proﬁlin is in a rapid equilibrium with Arp2 at a rate of at least 50 s 2 1 . Arp2 / 3 Complex Cross - links Actin Filaments Filament cross - linking proteins are traditionally classed as either bundling or network - forming pro - teins , depending on their tendency to form either par - allel bundles or randomly oriented isotropic networks of ﬁlaments . However , many actin - binding proteins , such as a - actinin , induce the formation of both bun - dles and isotropic networks . Wachsstock et al . ( 1993a ) proposed a model to describe the dependence of the mechanical properties of cross - linked actin ﬁlament networks on the concentrations of actin and cross - linker . At low concentrations of cross - linker , ﬁlaments are bound in a random isotropic network that behaves like a single elastic solid . In this region , the complex modulus u G * u increases and the phase shift d decreases as a function of cross - linker concentration . Above a threshold concentration that depends on the afﬁnity of the cross - linker , actin ﬁlaments become organized into bundles . These bundles , although long and stiff , can slip past each other in solution and behave more like a very viscous ﬂuid . In this region u G * u begins to de - crease , and d begins to increase as a function of cross - linker concentration . To determine whether Arp2 / 3 complex preferen - tially forms bundles or isotropic networks in solution we performed quantitative rheometry on actin ﬁla - ments cross - linked with Arp2 / 3 complex . With 15 m M ﬁlamentous actin , concentrations of Arp2 / 3 complex from 0 . 1 – 3 . 0 m M produced monotonically increasing Figure 4 .

Samples contained 15 m M rabbit skeletal muscle actin in the absence ( F ) or presence of Arp2 / 3 complex at 0 . 1 m M ( E ) , 0 . 5 m M ( f ) , 1 . 5 m M ( M ) , or 3 m M ( (cid:140) ) . Conditions were as follows . Cone and plate rheometer in the small amplitude ( strain # 2 % ) , forced oscillation mode . Buffer : 50 mM KCl , 10 mM imidazole , pH 7 . 0 , 1 mM EGTA , and 1 mM MgCl 2 . Arp2 / 3 complex was puriﬁed by conventional ion exchange chromatography . Arp2 / 3 Complex Vol . 9 , April 1998 847 Figure 5 . R . D . Mullins et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 848 values of u G * u and decreasing values of d , indicating that this range of concentrations and cross - linker : actin ratios produces primarily isotropic networks ( Figure 4 ) . At the same actin concentration , a - actinin from Acanthamoeba undergoes a transition from network to bundle formation at 0 . 1 m M , and a - actinin from chicken gizzard smooth muscle undergoes the same transition at 1 . 0 m M . Arp2 / 3 complex , therefore , has a greater tendency to form isotropic networks than a - ac - tinin . In the electron microscope , however , we also observe ﬁlament bundles induced by Arp2 / 3 com - plex . Therefore , Arp2 / 3 complex probably belongs , along with a - actinin , to that class of actin - binding proteins that can , under varying conditions of concen - tration and shear , form both bundles and isotropic networks of ﬁlaments . Arp2 / 3 complex decorates the sides of actin ﬁla - ments ( Mullins et al . , 1997 ) and caps pointed ends ( Mullins et al . , 1998 ) . This combination is sufﬁcient to link ﬁlaments into orthogonal networks . The concen - tration of ﬁlament pointed ends in our experiments , however , is in the nanomolar or subnanomolar range so the question becomes whether a nanomolar concen - tration of ﬁlament - ﬁlament cross - links is sufﬁcient to explain the large changes in viscosity we observe in our experiments . Wachsstock et al . ( 1993b ) demon - strated that the stiffness of a network is related in a complicated way to both the number and dynamics of cross - links . We can estimate the number of possible end - side cross - links in our rheometry experiments from the afﬁnity of Arp2 / 3 for pointed ends , approx - imately 20 nM ( Mullins and Pollard , unpublished Figure 6 .

Thin sectioned samples : 10 m M Acanthamoeba actin was polymerized in the absence or presence of 1 m M Arp2 / 3 complex . Samples were ﬁxed , stained , embedded in Epon , and thin - sectioned ( see MATERIALS AND METHODS ) . Arp2 / 3 complex in the negatively stained samples was puriﬁed by proﬁlin : poly - L - proline afﬁnity chromatography and in the thin - sec - tioned samples by conventional ion exchange chromatography . Arp2 / 3 Complex Vol . 9 , April 1998 849 data ) . With 5 nM ﬁlament ends in a solution of 15 m M ﬁlamentous actin , 0 . 5 m M Arp2 / 3 will cap 4 . 8 nM of the pointed ends , and at 1 . 5 m M it will cap 4 . 9 nM . Over the same concentration range , however , the stiff - ness of the ﬁlament network increases by more than a factor of 2 , suggesting that the network formation activity cannot be completely explained by end - side associations but is also produced by side - side cross - links . The existence of two ﬁlament side - binding sites in addition to the pointed end binding site is also consistent with the fact that three subunits can be chemically cross - linked to actin ﬁlaments ( Mullins et al . , 1997 ) . Subcellular Localizations of Arp2 / 3 and a - Actinin Arp2 / 3 complex cross - links actin ﬁlaments in a man - ner similar to a - actinin , so we wondered if the cellular functions of these proteins overlap . One way to ad - dress this question is to determine the extent to which the subcellular distributions of the two proteins over - lap . By immunoﬂuorescence microscopy , we ﬁnd both Arp2 / 3 and a - actinin enriched in peripheral regions of cells , but the staining patterns do not overlap com - pletely , particularly at the leading edge ( Figure 10 ) . The staining of Arp2 / 3 subunits is enriched at the leading edge of adherent Acanthamoeba and ﬁbrillar in character , while a - actinin staining is diffuse or unde - tectable at the leading edge ( Figure 6 ) . We consistently observe that , even in cells with a - actinin staining near the leading edge , the staining does not reach the plasma membrane while Arp3 , Arp2 , p40 , and p35 staining always extends to the tip of the leading edge . The fact that Arp2 / 3 localizes to the tip of the lead - ing edge suggests that it does not passively diffuse into the region but is involved in the initial events of leading edge formation . This pattern is consistent with the recent observation that pseudopodia produced by rapidly polymerizing actin ﬁlaments in the tails of motile Listeria monocytogenes also do not contain a - ac - tinin ( Sechi et al . , 1997 ) . One explanation for the ab - sence of a - actinin in such actin - rich structures is that they form more rapidly than a - actinin can diffuse into them . The cellular concentrations of ﬁlamentous actin and a - actinin in Acanthamoeba are approximately 100 and 5 m M ( Gordon et al . , 1976 ; Pollard et al . , 1986 ) and the K d of a - actinin binding to actin ﬁlaments is 5 m M so at a given time more than 95 % of the cellular a - actinin is bound to existing ﬁlaments . The dissocia - tion rate constant of Acanthamoeba a - actinin is 5 s 2 1 ( Wachsstock et al . , 1993a ) while the rate of addition of actin monomers to existing ﬁlaments in vivo can be as high 1000 s 2 1 , so it is possible in a cell for ﬁlament formation to outpace a - actinin redistribution , espe - cially in regions where actin polymerization is driving membrane protrusion . Role of Proﬁlin in Arp2 / 3 Function How does proﬁlin , which interacts with both actin and Arp2 , affect the interaction of actin with Arp2 / 3 com - plex ? Arp2 / 3 complex nucleates barbed end growth of ﬁlaments and remains tightly attached to the pointed ends of ﬁlaments . Proﬁlin - bound actin mono - mers add to the barbed end of an actin ﬁlament with the same kinetics as free monomers so we would not expect proﬁlin to affect the ability of actin to bind Arp2 / 3 complex . Arp2 / 3 binds ﬁlament ends with nanomolar afﬁnity ( Mullins et al . , 1998 ) and proﬁlin with micromolar afﬁnity so we would also not expect proﬁlin to signiﬁcantly inhibit binding of Arp2 / 3 to actin ﬁlament ends . The afﬁnity of proﬁlin for its ligands varies consid - erably : submicromolar for actin monomers , an order of magnitude weaker for Arp2 / 3 complex , and yet another order of magnitude weaker for both actin dimers and the ends of actin ﬁlaments . For barbed ends the K d is estimated at 50 m M ( Cooper and Pol - lard , 1985 ; Kaiser et al . , 1986 ) , and for cross - linked actin dimers it is estimated at 70 m M ( Mockrin and Korn , 1983 ) . Cooper and Pollard ( 1985 ) speculated that steric hindrance from adjacent subunits in a ﬁlament reduces the afﬁnity for proﬁlin . The low afﬁnity of proﬁlin for cross - linked actin dimers ( Mockrin and Korn , 1983 ) indicates that a single additional mono - mer could produce such hindrances . If steric con - straints are indeed responsible for the low afﬁnity of actin ﬁlaments and dimers for proﬁlin , then these constraints are not as severe in the Arp2 / 3 complex , suggesting that Arp2 and Arp3 are not packed exactly like actin subunits at the end of a ﬁlament . Given a K d of 7 m M , is there enough free proﬁlin in Acanthamoeba to bind a substantial fraction of Arp2 / 3 complex ? The concentrations of proﬁlin ( Tseng et al . , 1984 ) and unpolymerized actin ( Gordon et al . , 1976 ) are about 100 m M each and that of Arp2 / 3 complex is 2 m M ( Kelleher et al . , 1995 ) . Calculations based on equilibrium binding constants and results from cell fractionation studies ( Perelroizen et al . , 1994 ; Vinson , DeLaCruz , Kaiser , Higgs , and Pollard , in preparation ; Kaiser , unpublished observations ) indicate that only 70 – 80 % of cellular proﬁlin is bound to actin . Thus , in the absence of other competing ligands , a cellular pool of 20 – 30 m M proﬁlin is available to bind Arp2 / 3 com - plex . At these concentrations about 75 % of the avail - able Arp2 / 3 complex would be saturated with proﬁ - lin . So , despite its relative weakness , the interaction may have physiological signiﬁcance . Arp2 and Arp3 bind and hydrolyze ATP , but the exchange of nucle - otide from the Arp2 / 3 complex is very slow ( Mullins and Kelleher , unpublished observations ) so one pos - sible function of proﬁlin binding is to facilitate nucle - otide exchange in the complex . R . D . Mullins et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 850 Biological Implications of Filament Cross - linking Activity At the leading edge of motile cells we expect Arp2 / 3 complex to nucleate ﬁlament formation , cap the ﬁla - ment pointed ends ( Mullins and Pollard , unpublished data ) , and bind the sides of ﬁlaments ( Mullins et al . , 1997 ) . These activities are sufﬁcient to form orthogonal networks of actin ﬁlaments in which the pointed ends are attached to the sides of other ﬁlaments in T junc - tions of the type observed at the leading edges of ﬁsh keratocytes ( Small , et al . , 1995 ; Svitkina et al . , 1997 ) . As discussed above , one side binding and one pointed end binding site are probably insufﬁcient to produce the stiff orthogonal networks observed in our rheo - metric experiments , so there may be an additional ﬁlament binding site . Arp2 / 3 complex is thus capable of promoting poly - merization at the leading edge and attaching newly formed ﬁlaments to a rigid structure , a requirement for the “Elastic Brownian ratchet” model of polymer - ization - driven motility ( Mogilner and Oster , 1996 ) . As the actin ﬁlaments grow at their membrane - proximal ends and drive forward motility ( Tilney et al . , 1981 ; Wang , 1985 ) , the bound complex will be translocated away from the membrane . This would explain the uniform localization of the complex throughout the actin - rich zone of the leading edge and all along the actin ﬁlament tails of motile Listeria ( Welch , et al . , 1997a ) . The partitioning of Arp2 / 3 complex to the leading edge and a - actinin to other parts of the amoeba cortex suggests that other cross - linking pro - teins ( with different properties ) replace the complex at the lateral margins of protrusive zones . Our observations raise several questions for future study : Are the nucleation and ﬁlament cross - linking activities separable ? If so , are they regulated sepa - rately in the cell ? Which activity of the complex is essential for cell polarity and motility—nucleation , ﬁlament organization , or both ? The answers to these questions will provide us with a more complete pic - ture of how living cells regulate motility and shape changes .
