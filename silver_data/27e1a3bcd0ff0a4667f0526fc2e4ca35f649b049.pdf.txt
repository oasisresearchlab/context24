A . ) County youth followed at our institution during the first pandemic year . Design and Methods A prospective cohort of patients aged < 25 years with positive SARS - CoV - 2 RT - PCR between 03 / 13 / 2020 to 03 / 31 / 2021 was evaluated at a large L . A . County health network . Demographics , age distribution and disease severity were analyzed . Results : There were 28 , 088 youth < 25 years of age tested for SARS - CoV - 2 by RT - PCR , with 1 , 849 positives identified ( 7 % ) . Among the positive , 475 of 11 , 922 ( 4 % ) were identified at the pandemic onset ( 03 - 09 / 2020 ) ( Cohort 1 ) and 1 , 374 of 16 , 166 ( 9 % ) between 10 / 2020 to 03 / 2021 ( Cohort 2 ) , p < 0 . 001 . When disease severity was compared across cohorts , Cohort 2 had a greater proportion of asymptomatic , and mild / moderate disease categories than Cohort 1 ( 98 % vs . 80 % , respectively ) ; conversely , Cohort 1 had a near 10 - fold higher proportion of severe disease than cohort 2 ( 17 % vs . 1 . 8 % ) . Cohort 2 was comprised by younger individuals with a mean age of 13 . 7 vs . 17 . 3 years in Cohort 1 . Older age was associated with a higher percentage of infection , 63 % of 19 - 25 year olds in cohort 1 vs . 38 % in Cohort 2 . Age increase was also associated with greater disease severity by linear regression modeling . ( p < 0 . 001 ) . Conclusions : COVID - 19 disease severity in youth decreased over time in L . A . County during the first pandemic year , likely a reflection of changing demographics with younger children infected . A higher infection rate in youth did not lead to higher disease severity over time . Keywords : COVID - 19 , children , youth , disease severity Introduction 3 With increased testing availability , studies show that children aged 5 years or older have SARS CoV - 2 infection rates similar to that of adults ( Grijalva et al . , 2020 , Kim et al . , 2021 , Lugon et al . , 2021 , Smith et al . , 2021 , Zimmermann and Curtis , 2020 ) . Multiple studies suggest that individuals younger than 25 years of age are more likely to have asymptomatic SARS - CoV - 2 infections or mild symptoms as compared to older patients ( Dawood et al . , 2022 , Han et al . , 2021 , Rosenberg et al . , 2020 , Siebach et al . , 2021 ) . Nevertheless , younger individuals still tend to shed SARS - CoV - 2 with high viral loads in the upper respiratory tract which are comparable to or even higher than those reported in older adults ( Somekh et al . , 2021 ) . With the advent of new SARS - CoV - 2 variants of concern ( VOC ) , household transmission rates have increased with introduction of more transmissible variants ( Paul et al . , 2021 ) . In one study , children aged 4 to 8 years of age and 9 to 13 years had increased odds of transmission , suggesting that children may play a larger role in SARS - CoV - 2 transmission than older adolescents and adults ( Stokes et al . , 2020 ) . Los Angeles ( L . A . ) County is one of the largest and most socio - economically diverse counties in the United States . It has over 10 million residents , with youth , ( individuals < 25 years of age ) comprising nearly one third of the population ( US Census website ) . During the initial six months of the pandemic ( March - September 2020 ) , we conducted a prospective cohort study with case - control analyses in youth who received testing for SARS - CoV - 2 at our academic institution in L . A . County ( Newhouse et al . , 2021 ) . In this study , patterns of COVID - 19 symptoms varied significantly by age group , with number of symptoms correlating significantly with age . Younger youth , who were students , were less likely to have positive results when compared to older youth , who were employed . Additionally , cases were more likely to be from non - English - 4 speaking households , zip codes with higher proportion of Hispanic individuals ; and residents living under the poverty line ( Newhouse et al . , 2021 ) . During the second half of the pandemic’s first year ( October 2020 - March 2021 ) , L . A . County had a surge and reported the highest number of cases and deaths in all age groups in California , with 1 , 185 , 457 cases and 20 , 987 deaths ( COVID19 Dashboard , 2022 ) . Additionally , novel SARS - CoV - 2 variants became more predominant , including alpha , beta , and gamma ( Abdel Latif et al . , 2021 ) . By the end of the first year of the pandemic , delta was detected and started to rise in L . A . County . The presence of novel variants raised concerns for increased infectivity and virulence . The purpose of this cohort study was to characterize the evolution of SARS - CoV - 2 infection in L . A . County youth followed at our institution during the first year of the pandemic , comparing youth from the first six months and second six months . There is an urgent need to collect more information on the immediate clinical repercussions of COVID - 19 infection in youth and how the disease has evolved during the pandemic . A better understanding on how the disease presents over time in younger populations has important implications given the development of variants of concern ( VOC ) and the changing nature of the SARS - CoV - 2 virus . Methods Population , Setting & Data Collection 5 We conducted a cohort study of youth aged less than 25 years who tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 infection at our institution , comprised by a large academic medical center ( Ronald Reagan Medical Center and Mattel Children’s Hospital at UCLA ) , a community hospital ( UCLA Santa Monica Hospital ) and a widespread network of UCLA - affiliated clinics throughout L . A . County from March 13 , 2020 , until March 31 , 2021 . Our primary outcomes of interest were disease severity and age distribution of illness in children and youth with a positive reverse - transcriptase polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) over time . All participants were tested for SARS - COV - 2 by RT - PCR assays . Each participant was only counted once in the cohort , even if more than one PCR test was performed . If a participant had multiple positive and negative results , the first positive recorded result was used . Confirmed cases of COVID - 19 were defined as any positive RT - PCR result . Cohort 1 , youth who tested positive for COVID - 19 by RT - PCR in the initial six months of the pandemic , from March to September 30 , 2020 ( Newhouse et al . , 2021 ) , were compared to Cohort 2 youth of the same age who tested positive for COVID - 19 in the second half of the pandemic’s initial year from October 2020 to March 2021 . This period coincided with a surge in SARS - CoV - 2 cases in L . A . County in December 2020 . Data abstracted from electronic medical records included demographics , zip code , clinical findings and disease severity . All youth were classified as having asymptomatic , mild , moderate , severe , or critical COVID - 19 according to the National Institutes of Health ' s Coronavirus Disease ( COVID - 19 ) Treatment Guidelines ( COVID - 19 Treatment Guidelines Panel , 2021 ) . Study activities were approved by the UCLA Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) . Youth with a clinical diagnosis of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children ( MIS - C ) were also evaluated and described separately ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , 2021 ) . 6 Children with a MIS - C clinical diagnosis had either a positive RT - PCR , or SARS - CoV - 2 antibody test ( without vaccination ) ; or exposure to a suspected or confirmed COVID - 19 case within 4 weeks prior to the onset of symptoms ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , 2021 ) . All children with MIS - C had an RT - PCR and a serologic assay for SARS CoV - 2 performed . Laboratory Testing The UCLA Clinical Microbiology Laboratory performed all SARS - CoV - 2 RT - PCR testing . Cycle threshold ( Ct ) values were analyzed for all positive RT - PCR tests ; positive RT - PCR was defined as a Ct value < 40 . For each patient with a positive result RT - PCR , the assay used and Ct values for each target were recorded . This methodology was previously described ( Newhouse et al . , 2021 ) . In children with MIS - C , serologic testing for anti - SARS CoV - 2 IgG and IgM were also performed . Sera were analyzed by enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) to detect the spike receptor - binding domain ( RBD ) , IgG and IgM as previously described ( Newhouse et al . , 2021 ) . Data Analysis Descriptive analysis of the demographics of all patients < 25 years of age who had RT - PCR test results in our health system was performed . To describe the total population of youth who received testing at UCLA , we conducted a chi - square test to compare basic demographic information between youth testing positive for SARS - CoV2 at our institution during the first and second waves of the pandemic . Disease severity was transformed into a numeric scale to examine severity as a continuous variable between cohorts , defined as Asymptomatic = 1 , 7 Mild / Moderate = 2 , Severe / Critical = 3 , Death = 4 . Individuals with no clinical data available in the medical records to generate a disease severity category or individuals tested outside of our institution were excluded from further analysis . Linear regression and correlation coefficients estimated the severity of symptoms by change in age , and βs between the regression lines for cases and controls were analyzed using a T - test . For each ZIP code in L . A . County , we tabulated the proportion of residents of each race / ethnicity based on the most recent US census ( Farris , 2020 ) . Subsequently , we tallied the race / ethnicity of the highest proportion of the residents ( hereafter “predominant ethnicity” ) . For each ZIP code we calculated the total number of study participants tested for SARS - CoV - 2 at UCLA during the first two periods of the pandemic , as well as the number of tests that were positive . From these data , we calculated the mean positivity rate for all ZIP codes in each cohort . We subsequently classified each ZIP code as having above or below average positivity . The purpose of this analysis was that by leveraging these variables , we aimed to determine the number of ZIP codes predominantly Hispanic or predominantly white with above average SARS - CoV - 2 positivity rates in both cohorts during the pandemic . Determination of VOC in L . A . County Using genomic data on SARS - CoV - 2 from the GISAID initiative , we calculated the frequency of SARS - CoV - 2 VOCs , Variants of Interest , and common lineages by month from March 2020 to March 2021 ( Abdel Latif et al . , 2021 ) . Results 8 A total of 28 , 088 SARS - CoV - 2 RT - PCR assays were performed in youth between March 13 , 2020 , to March 31 , 2021 ( Table 1 and Figure 1 ) . A total of 1 , 849 youth ( 7 % ) had positive PCR results during this time period . This included 475 positive youth ( 4 % ) from 11 , 922 tested at the onset of the pandemic from March to September 2020 ( Cohort 1 ) and 1 , 374 positive youth ( 9 % ) from 16 , 166 tested between October 2020 to March 2021 ( Cohort 2 ) . Figure 1 depicts the overall number of youths tested and absolute cases over time . The number of youths testing positive for SARS - CoV - 2 was significantly higher ( 9 % vs 4 % , p < 0 . 001 ) in Cohort 2 as compared to Cohort 1 , corresponding to the L . A . County’s surveillance data ( December 2020 - February 2021 ( COVID19Dashboard , 2022 ) . In cohort 2 , 225 youth had no clinical information available in the medical records and / or were tested at an outside facility being excluded from further analysis . Data was analyzed for 1624 cohort 2 youth . Over time ( Figure 2 ) , there was a shift in the mean age of confirmed cases in the study population . In Cohort 1 , the mean age was 17 . 3 years , whereas in Cohort 2 , the mean age was 13 . 7 years ( Table 1 p < 0 . 001 ) . In both time periods , the older youth ( 19 - 25 years ) represented the largest age group of all confirmed cases , with 63 % in Cohort 1 and 38 % in Cohort 2 , respectively ( Table 1 ) . Nevertheless , during the second half of the first pandemic year , a higher proportion of younger youth tested positive as compared to the prior six months especially notable in the 6 - to 11 - year - old age group , which more than doubled 7 . 4 % vs 15 . 4 % ( Table 1 and Figure 2 , p < 0 . 001 ) . In addition , there was a statistically significant higher proportion of youth aged 1 - 5 years , 10 . 3 % vs . 18 . 1 % , and 12 - 18 years , 16 . 4 % vs . 24 . 7 % in cohort 2 who tested positive compared to those in Cohort 1 ( Table 1 and Figure 2 , p < 0 . 001 ) . A larger proportion of 9 older youth ( 19 - 25 years ) tested positive in Cohort 1 were employed , especially as essential workers ( older youth ) , as compared to Cohort 2 , in which most youth who tested positive were younger and students , with the proportion of working youth falling from 19 % in the first cohort to 7 % in the second cohort , ( Table 1 p < 0 . 001 ) . Most of the children and youth testing positive for SARS - CoV - 2 had mild or asymptomatic illness regardless of study period . When comparing both time frames , youth testing positive in Cohort 2 had a greater proportion ( 98 . 3 % ) of asymptomatic or mild / moderate illness as compared to Cohort 1 ( 80 % ) ( Table 1 p < 0 . 001 ) . However , there was a ten - fold higher proportion of severe or critical illnesses in Cohort 1 as compared to Cohort 2 , 16 . 6 % vs . 1 . 5 % ( Table 1 , p < 0 . 0001 ) . Using a linear regression model stratified for cohort , an increase in age was associated with development of more severe disease . However , the first cohort saw a more drastic increase in disease severity with age ( B = 0 . 03 , p < 0 . 001 , 95 % CI 0 . 018 , 0 . 035 , R = 0 . 26 ) than the second cohort ( B = 0 . 004 , 95 % CI 0 . 002 , p = 0 . 01 , R = 0 . 08 ) . R correlation comparison ( p < 0 . 004 ) . ( Figure 3 ; Table 1 ) . In total , only 3 youth died because of COVID - 19 with an overall case fatality of 0 . 18 % . This included a 16 - year old male with co - morbidities and MIS - C in Cohort 1 ( case fatality 0 . 21 % ) , and 2 older youth ( ages 19 and 23 ) with COVID - 19 pneumonia ( case - fatality 0 . 17 % ) . One youth was previously healthy and the other had underlying co - morbidities . Race / ethnicity was available for 1 , 508 youth with SARS - CoV - 2 during the study period . When compared to other ethnic groups , Hispanic youth made up the largest group testing positive for SARS - CoV - 2 . There was a significant increase in the percentage of Hispanic youth testing positive in Cohort 2 as compared to Cohort 1 , increasing from 34 . 5 % to 52 . 2 % ( Table 1 , 10 p < 0 . 001 ) . The proportion of Black / African individuals with SARS CoV - 2 also increased in Cohort 2 as compared to Cohort 1 , from 6 . 1 % to 10 . 3 % ( Table 1 , p < 0 . 0001 ) . The proportion of patients with White and Asian ethnicity remained relatively the same throughout both periods ( Table 1 ) , although Zip code - specific analysis showed an increase in white youth in areas with above average SARS CoV - 2 positivity ( Figure 4C ) . Zip codes with a higher proportion of Hispanic residents and / or residents living under the poverty line had higher number of SARS - CoV - 2 cases during both study periods ( Figure 4 panels A and B ) . In Cohort 2 , there were more areas of L . A . County impacted with a greater spread of SARS - CoV - 2 infection in youth across the county , with the inclusion of more affluent neighborhoods . ( Figures 4 panels A , and B ) . In Cohort 2 , there was a greater number of White youth testing positive within their respective zip codes as compared to Hispanic youth ( Figure 4 panel C ) , which reflects a broader socioeconomic and ethnic distribution of infected youth in the second half of the first pandemic year . Additionally , there was a higher proportion of patients with Medical / Safety net insurance in Cohort 2 as compared to Cohort 1 , 26 . 8 % vs . 22 . 5 % , respectively ( Table 1 , p < 0 . 001 ) . The proportion of insured and uninsured youth testing positive for SARS - CoV - 2 during the two time periods did not differ enough to achieve statistical significance . During October 2020 to March 2021 , several SARS - CoV - 2 VOC emerged over time ( Figure 5 ) . In the first two months of the second half of the pandemic’s first year , the most common strains circulating in L . A . County were the Epsilon variant ( B . 1 . 247 and B . 1 . 249 ) . As the surge continued , other predominant variants including the Alpha variant ( B . 1 . 1 . 7 ) started emerging . 11 By the end of the study period , the Delta variant ( B . 1 . 617 and its derivative lineages ) had begun to emerge ( Abdel Latif et al . , 2021 ) . A total of 11 cases of MIS - C were identified over the study period in 1624 youth ( 0 . 68 % ) . In Cohort 1 , there were three cases of MIS - C , with an average age of 12 . 5 years , with 2 males affected . Two of the children were healthy , while the third youth had a chronic medical condition requiring immune suppression . This patient died following a complicated hospital course . In Cohort 2 , there were eight MIS - C cases with an average age of 8 . 62 years , 62 . 5 % males and mainly Hispanic / Latin - X ethnicity ( 75 % ) . Two of the eight patients had underlying medical disorders predisposing to severe SARS - CoV2 infection , but in Cohort 2 , all children with MIS - C survived . Discussion During the first year of the COVID - 19 pandemic in L . A . County , there was a change in age distribution , demographics and clinical presentation of disease between the first and second six months of the pandemic’s initial year . In the first half , most of the youth tested at our health system were older , 19 - 25 years , with a higher positivity rate observed in this age range , consistent with trends in the distribution of COVID - 19 at the time ( CDC , 2022 ) . However , in the second six months , the proportion of children and youth younger than 15 years of age testing positive for SARS - CoV - 2 nearly doubled . 12 Many factors may have contributed to higher number of children and younger youth testing positive in L . A . County in the second half of the pandemic such as lock - down restriction set in the first half of the pandemic being removed ; children returning to school and other social activities ; and possibly the emergence of SARS - CoV - 2 VOCs with greater infectivity leading to potentially higher infections in younger children . As may be surmised , differential infectivity of pediatric age groups has important implications for infection prevention within households , as well as schools / childcare , to minimize risk of household secondary transmission . In a study among children and adolescents from the Moderna province of Italy , individuals who underwent nasal SARS - CoV2 PCR testing , 84 . 2 % reported close contact with an infected cohabiting relative and 45 . 3 % were symptomatic ( Paduano et al 2021 ) . Furthermore , children and adults have been demonstrated to have similar incidence rates of SARS - CoV - 2 infection ( Dawood et al . , 2022 ) which underscores the need for rapid evaluation of vaccine efficacy and safety in children to expand vaccine indications to younger age groups . Although one would expect that more severe cases would be noted with a higher number of infections in Cohort 2 , during the pandemic surge , cases of COVID - 19 in youth tended to be milder and often asymptomatic . As such , the proportion of severe / critical cases in youth diminished significantly , likely due to the age shift to younger age groups during the second period of the pandemic’s initial year . This finding was corroborated by our linear regression model which demonstrated an increase in age was associated with development of more severe disease , which was particularly striking in Cohort 1 early in the pandemic . Our results likely reflect a larger representation of younger children in the second half of the pandemic’s first year , which is consistent with prior studies showing that youth tend to have more milder symptoms or 13 be asymptomatic ( Bailey et al . , 2021 , Choi et al . , 2020 , Dawood et al . , 2022 , Kim et al . , 2020 , Lazzerini et al . , 2021 ) . Even though a rare complication of COVID - 19 , cases of MIS - C typically peak several weeks after COVID - 19 surges in the community . Not surprisingly , during the surge period in the second half of the year , we noted a higher number of MIS - C cases in Cohort 2 . MIS - C cases were , nevertheless , exceedingly rare ( 0 . 68 % cases in the entire cohort ) . Although severe cases of COVID - 19 can occur in children , adolescents and young adults , when compared to adults 25 years of age or older , most cases in younger age groups appear to be milder infections ( Liguoro et al . , 2020 , Mehta et al . , 2020 , Stokes et al . , 2020 ) . In a systematic review of 18 studies evaluating symptoms and signs of COVID - 19 in children and youth less than 20 years of age with documented infection , the proportion of asymptomatic infections ranged from 15 to 42 percent ( Viner et al . , 2020 ) . Consequently , symptoms in children may often go unrecognized before a laboratory diagnosis is made ( Han et al . , 2021 ) . With universal testing for SARS - CoV - 2 upon admission to most hospitals , the rates of hospitalization for SARS - CoV - 2 in children can be overestimated if hospitalizations for COVID - 19 - related illness are not differentiated from hospitalizations due situations when incidental detection of SARS - CoV - 2 occurs ( Webb and Osburn , 2021 , Woodruff et al . , 2021 ) . In CDC surveillance studies of COVID - 19 in the United States , the presence of underlying medical conditions has been associated with higher rates of hospitalization among youth with co - morbidities ( 15 to 22 % ) as compared to youth without these findings ( 2 to 4 % ) . Whether underlying conditions are associated with increased severity or only a lower threshold for admission due to concerns for complications is unknown ( CDC , 2022 , Kim et al . , 2020 , Webb and Osburn , 2021 , Woodruff et al . , 2021 ) . 14 Children from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups have been disproportionately affected by higher rates of SARS - CoV - 2 infection ( Newhouse et al . , 2021 , Van Dyke et al . , 2021 ) . In one study of L . A . County urban children and youth less than18 years of age , from June - December 2020 , children were found to play an important role as index cases . Secondary attack rates ( SAR ) were disproportionately impacted by household income ( Tanaka et al . , 2021 ) . ( Tanaka et al . , 2021 ) . Furthermore , in a large US pediatric cohort study , compared to White children , those of Black , Hispanic , and / or Asian race / ethnicities had lower rates of testing but were significantly more likely to have positive test results ( Bailey et al 2021 ) . In our analysis , Hispanic youth made up the largest ethnic group testing positive during the first year of the pandemic in L . A . County . However , with geographic epidemic modeling , when comparing both Cohorts 1 and 2 , we noted a rise in the number of infections in youth from many ethnic groups and all socioeconomic classes likely reflecting the impact of the pandemic surge during that time period . Our cohort study is the first to characterize the evolution of SARS - CoV - 2 infection in L . A . County youth followed at our institution during the pandemic . The study has several strengths , including a large sample size of ethnically and socioeconomically diverse youth with RT - PCR confirmed SARS - CoV - 2 infection . We were able to report on youth identified during different periods of the pandemic , with sufficient data to characterize COVID - 19 outcomes in this studied population demonstrating an association between age and risk of disease severity even among young individuals . 15 Although our patients came from socioeconomically diverse areas of L . A . County being recruited from a vast network of clinical centers and two hospitals , one study limitation is that our data comes from a single institution . As a tertiary medical center , our pediatric patient population tends to be more medically complex as compared to the general population . Another study limitation is that 225 youth in cohort 2 ( 14 % of participants who tested positive during that period ) were excluded from our analysis for lack of clinical data and / or because of testing performed at an outside institution , thus not meeting eligibility criteria for study inclusion . During the study period , antigen testing for SARS CoV - 2 was not performed at our institution and only RT = PCR results were evaluated . It is likely that these individuals were asymptomatic given the lack of additional clinical information , however we are unable to confirm this assumption . Our analysis predates the evaluation of the impact of vaccine administration to youth , as patients in this age group began to be immunized in April 2021 , which is after our study period ended . Therefore , we cannot extrapolate our study findings to populations exposed to COVID - 19 vaccines . In summary , we characterized the SARS - CoV - 2 infection in youth during the first year of the pandemic , including a winter surge period in L . A . County . An increased proportion of younger children became infected with SARS - CoV2 virus as the pandemic unfolded . Interestingly , although the number of cases of COVID - 19 in youth increased 2 . 4 - fold during the 2020 - 2021 winter surge , and one would expect to see a higher number of sicker youths , a significant reduction in disease severity was noted during this period . This reflects higher infection rates in younger age groups . Future analysis of disease presentation in youth during subsequent COVID - 16 19 pandemic periods should determine if this disease pattern continued to prevail with the availability of vaccines to this population .

A . County ( November 2020 to February 2021 ) . From March 2020 to March 2021 , 26 , 239 SARS - CoV - 2 RT - PCR assays were performed in 28 , 088 patients less than 25 years of age with 7 % positive results . At the onset of the pandemic ( 03 - 09 / 2020 ) , 4 % of youth tested were positive ( Cohort 1 ) and 9 % of the youth tested were positive between 10 / 2020 to 03 / 2021 ( Cohort 2 ) . 24 Figure 2 : SARS - CoV - 2 positivity by age among the two different waves . In the second period of the pandemic , there is more representation of younger age youth . 25 Figure 3 : In an analysis of correlation coefficients of disease severity and age , increase in age was associated with development of more severe disease . Severity was transformed into a numeric scale to examine severity as a continuous variable between cohorts , defined as Asymptomatic = 1 , Mild / Moderate = 2 , Severe / Critical = 3 , Death = 4 . The first cohort saw a more drastic increase in severity with age ( R = 0 . 26 , 95 % CI 0 . 018 , 0 . 035 , ) than the second cohort ( R = 0 . 08 , 95 % CI 0 . 002 , 0 . 008 ) . R correlation comparison ( p < = 0 . 004 ) . Figure 4 : 4A and 4B : Comparison of Zip codes of youth infected by SARS - CoV - 2 in two periods in the first year of the L . A . County pandemic . With the second wave , there is a greater spread and distribution to multiple neighborhoods in the county . 4C : When comparing the two periods of the pandemic , there is greater percentage of positivity among whites by zip code analysis in the second time period . 26 Figure 5 : Different variants circulating by month in L . A . County during March 2020 to March 2021 27 Table 1 . Demographics , co - morbidities , and disease severity in L . A . County youth during two pandemic periods .
