Talin and kindlin : the one - two punch in integrin activation Feng Ye ( ✉ ) a , Adam K . Snider , Mark H . Ginsberg ( ✉ ) b Department of Medicine , University of California , San Diego , La Jolla , CA 92093 , USA © Higher Education Press and Springer - Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014 Abstract Proper cell - cell and cell - matrix contacts mediated by integrin adhesion receptors are important for development , immune response , hemostasis and wound healing . Integrins pass trans - membrane signals bidirectionally through their regulated af ﬁ nities for extracellular ligands and intracellular signaling molecules . Such bidirectional signaling by integrins is enabled by the conformational changes that are often linked among extracellular , transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains . Here , we review how talin - integrin and kindlin - integrin interactions , in cooperation with talin - lipid and kindlin - lipid interactions , regulate integrin af ﬁ nities and how the progress in these areas helps us understand integrin - related diseases . Keywords signal transduction ; transmembrane domain ; nanodisc ; integrin ; talin ; kindling ; cell adhesion Introduction Evolution from single cells to multicellular organisms necessitates cell - matrix and cell - cell adhesion mechanisms to organize cells into tissue and organs . Integrins , hetero - dimeric type I transmembrane proteins consisting of α and β subunits , are a major class of adhesion receptors involved in such adhesive events . Each integrin subunit contains a relatively large extracellular domain , a single transmembrane domain ( TMD ) and a short cytoplasmic tail . 18 α subunits and 8 β subunits dimerize noncovalently to form 24 different integrins [ 1 ] . Each integrin exhibits distinct binding af ﬁ nities to particular ligands . When combined with various integrin expression pro ﬁ les of different cell types , the ligand speci ﬁ city results in cells adhering in or migrating toward speci ﬁ c regions where ligands of the particular set of integrins are present [ 2 ] . Besides mediating cell adhesions , integrins also transmit signals bidirectionally . In outside - in signaling , they can transmit information on the chemical identity and physical property of their ligands into cells to regulate cell migration , cell survival and growth [ 3 ] . Integrins have no enzymatic activities in their cytoplasmic tails , but ligation of integrins with their extracellular ligands can induce conformational changes [ 4 ] that result in the separation of the α and β TMD and cytoplasmic tails . These changes may make the cytoplasmic tails of integrins more accessible and favor recruitment of cytoplasmic proteins , such as kinases , phosphotases and scaffold proteins that link integrins to signaling molecules or cytoskeletons [ 3 , 5 – 12 ] . Furthermore , integrins cluster upon ligation with extracellular matrices which usually present multiple integrin binding sites [ 13 ] . At the site of ligand - bound integrins , kinases auto - phosphorylate and phosphorylate other signaling proteins , adaptors and phosphoinositides [ 3 , 6 , 14 – 25 ] . This triggers further recruit - ment of signaling molecules and subsequent signaling events [ 3 , 6 , 14 – 25 ] . Integrins can also signal through other trans - membrane receptors such as those containing immunorecep - tor tyrosine - based activation motifs ( ITAMs ) [ 26 – 28 ] . Integrin outside - in signaling may also be involved in registering mechanical forces . For example , when talin , one adaptor protein that links integrin to the cytoskeleton , is placed under strain , it undergoes conformational changes that expose binding sites for other adaptors , such as vinculin , to reinforce the integrin - actin linkage [ 29 – 32 ] . Thus , integrin outside - in signaling in ﬂ uences cell behaviors such as adhesion , shape changes and migration following integrin - ECM ligation , and persistent integrin outside - in signaling , speci ﬁ ed by different mechanical properties of the ECM , may result in signaling pro ﬁ le and gene expression changes that determine the cell survival and cell fate [ 33 , 34 ] . In integrin inside - out signaling ( integrin activation ) , binding af ﬁ nity of integrins for speci ﬁ c ligands is swiftly increased in response to intracellular signaling events . Integrin activation , sometimes referred to as integrin af ﬁ nity modulation , encompasses both af ﬁ nity increase of individual integrins due to conformational changes and avidity increase due to integrin clustering [ 6 , 35 , 36 ] .

Med . 2014 , 8 ( 1 ) : 6 – 16 DOI 10 . 1007 / s11684 - 014 - 0317 - 3 integrins ’ adhesive capacity and ligand speci ﬁ city is espe - cially important in a cardiovascular system not only for a swift and local response at the site of injury or in ﬂ ammation but also for the prevention of unwanted consequences such as thrombosis or autoimmunity . Such paradigm of tight af ﬁ nity control is demonstrated in α IIb β 3 and β 2 integrins . α IIb β 3 , the most abundant membrane protein on the platelet surface [ 37 ] , is normally in a resting ( inactive ) state with low af ﬁ nity for its physiological ligands , such as ﬁ brinogen . As a result , platelets exhibit low adhesiveness to each other or the blood vessel wall to prevent occlusion of the blood vessel . A range of agonists present at the site of a wound can lead to an increase in α IIb β 3 binding to ﬁ brinogen ( i . e . , integrin activation ) , resulting in platelet aggregation , thrombus formation and hemostasis [ 38 ] . Similarly , β 2 integrins are in an inactive state on circulating leukocytes . At the site of in ﬂ ammation , agonists induce the activation of β 2 integrins , which leads to their binding to intercellular adhesion molecule ( ICAM ) and / or vascular cell adhesion molecule ( VCAM ) on the endothelium and thus the arrest of the leukocytes [ 39 ] . As molecules important in a number of physiological responses , integrins also contribute to the pathogenesis of many diseases such as thrombosis , cancer , and autoimmunity . Recent years have seen some tremendous progress in understanding the control mechanisms of integrin activation and offer the potential of translating this basic knowledge into therapeutics . In this review , we will summarize the most recent progress in understanding integrin regulation by activators such as talin and kindlins . The readers are referred to an excellent recent review on the negative regulators of integrins [ 40 ] . Conformational equilibrium balanced by the phospholipid bilayer and the integrin TMDs The structural changes in the integrin extracellular domain accompanying its af ﬁ nity changes have been reviewed in several excellent reviews [ 35 , 41 – 45 ] . Brie ﬂ y , the extracel - lular domain in its inactive form is folded into a V shape with a genu in the middle [ 46 , 47 ] . One view is that upon activation , it adopts an extended conformation with the hybrid domain swung out to form an open head piece [ 48 – 50 ] . However , some groups argued that the bent conformation can be active and fully occupied by physiological ligands [ 51 – 53 ] . Integrin TMDs play an essential role in transmitting signals across the plasma membrane . Truncation of the integrins at the C - termini of extracellular domains results in constitutively active integrins [ 54 ] , indicating that TMDs and cytoplasmic tails are critical in controlling the activation state of integrins . Furthermore , many activating mutations , from rational mutagenesis studies or genetic screens , map to the α or β TMD [ 55 – 58 ] , again showing that the TMDs are critical for integrin regulation . Heterodimeric interactions between α and β TMDs and cytoplasmic tails can be detected in a cellular membrane by co - immunoprecipitations [ 59 ] , cysteine cross - linking [ 60 , 61 ] and in a reconstituted phospholipid bilayer by NMR [ 62 ] , but not in detergent micelles [ 63 ] . Importantly , mutations in TMDs that activate integrins invariably inhibit α and β TMD - tail interactions [ 59 ] , and activating integrins alters the relationship of the α and β tails in cellular membranes [ 7 ] . Therefore , understanding the structure and interactions of integrin TMDs in a membrane environment is essential for the comprehension of the mechanism of integrin signal transmission . Integrin TMDs are usually about 20 hydrophobic amino acids in length and proceeded by Trp and charged residues at the C - termini . Two structures of α and β TMD complexes in phospholipid bilayers are available : one determined by NMR with α and β TMDs embedded in a phospholipid bilayer [ 62 ] and the other by inter - residue distance restraints inferred from cysteine crosslinking ef ﬁ ciency in a cellular membrane [ 60 ] . The two approaches yielded similar structures and revealed two interaction interfaces [ 60 , 62 ] . In both structures , the α IIb TMD helix is short , straight and broken at Gly991 , the ﬁ rst residue of the highly - conserved Gly - Phe - Phe - Lys - Arg ( GFFKR ) motif in the membrane proximal region of the α subunits . The two Phe residues of the α IIb GFFKR motif do not form a continuous helix but instead make a sharp turn toward β 3 ( Fig . 1 ) . In this way , the hydrophobic side chains of those residues can reside in the hydrophobic core of the lipid bilayer and stack against hydrophobic residues in the β 3 TMD , particularly Trp715 and Ile719 . The turning of the membrane - proximal region of α IIb also enables the electro - static interaction between α IIb Arg995 and β 3 Asp723 by placing those residues in proximity ( Fig . 1 ) . These sets of interactions at the inner membrane interface are termed the inner membrane clasp ( IMC ) . The second interface involves helical packing centered on β 3 Gly708 and α IIb G972XXXG976 motif at the outer membrane region and is termed the outer membrane clasp ( OMC ) ( Fig . 1 ) . Integrin β 3 TMD makes a long and continuous helix with a 25° tilting angle to enable the multipoint interactions with α IIb and accommodate the extra hydrophobic residues in the β 3 TMD . These landmark structural studies provided good explana - tions for all the previous mutational studies . The mutations , deletions or truncations to either subunit that result in active integrin in cells interfere with OMC , IMC or both . For example , mutating β 3 Gly708 , or either Gly in the α IIb G972XXXG976 motif into bulky amino acids disrupts the OMC , resulting in loss of α - β TMD interactions and constitutively active integrins [ 55 – 58 ] . Similarly , mutations in the two Phe residues of α IIb GFFKR motif or in the α IIb Arg995 and β 3 Asp723 electrostatic pair destabilize the IMC , also resulting in active integrins [ 64 ] . Since the optimal tilting angle of the β subunit is critical to maintain simultaneous OMC and IMC interactions with a short and straight α TMD , one would expect some mechanism to maintain the 25° β 3 tilting angle ( Figs . 1 and 2 ) . Indeed , C α of β 3 Lys716 resides Feng Ye et al . 7 in the hydrophobic region of the lipid bilayer but its positively charged ε - NH 3 + group snorkels into the negatively charged phosphate head group region ( Fig . 2 ) . By doing so , it helps control the tilting angle of β 3 TMD [ 65 ] . When Lys716 is mutated to negatively charged Glu , it shifts from the hydrophobic core into the aqueous region to avoid the unfavorable placement of negatively charged Glu in nega - tively charged phosphate head region ( Fig . 2 ) . As a result , K716E reduces the embedded length of β 3 TMD and the β 3 tilting angle , which in turn abolishes α - β TMD interactions and dramatically increases integrin activation ( Fig . 2 ) [ 65 ] . Interestingly , integrin activation caused by Lys716 mutation can be reversed by introducing a Pro mutation ( A711P ) in the middle of β 3 TMD . The Pro mutation breaks the continuous β TMD helix into two halves , enables the two helices to adopt different tilting angles to compensate the reduced embedding of β 3 TMD , restores simultaneous formation of OMC and IMC and thus reverts integrin activation [ 65 ] . Talin “ tilts ” integrin β TMD and the integrin activation equilibrium Talin , a cytoplasmic protein , regulates integrin af ﬁ nity and provides a mechanical link between integrins and the actin cytoskeleton . Talin consists of a 50 - kDa N - terminal non - canonical FERM domain ( talin head domain or THD ) that contains a high - af ﬁ nity binding site for integrin β subunit and a 220 - kDa rod domain that contains multiple binding sites for actin and vinculin [ 66 ] . The THD is further divided into F0 , F1 , F2 and F3 subdomains [ 66 , 67 ] . F3 subdomain , a phosphotyrosine binding domain , binds to the ﬁ rst NPxY motif in integrin β tails [ 68 , 69 ] . The important role of talin in regulating integrin af ﬁ nity has been well documented in model cells [ 69 – 72 ] , transgenic mice [ 73 , 74 ] and reconsti - tuted systems with puri ﬁ ed proteins [ 75 ] . Overexpression of THD strongly activates α IIb β 3 in nucleated cells [ 72 ] . Fig . 1 Structure of integrin α IIb β 3 TMD ( ribbon view ; α IIb in red and β 3 in blue . From PDB 2K9J ) showing the two interaction interfaces . Left , outer membrane clasp ( OMC ) . Right , inner membrane clasp ( IMC ) . The important residues for the two interfaces are indicated . Fig . 2 Snorkeling Lys716 ﬁ xes the tilting angle of the β 3 TMD . On the left , the C α of Lys716 resides in the hydrophobic core but its ε - NH 3 + group snorkels into the negatively charged phosphate head group region . On the right , when Lys716 is mutated to Glu , the residue shifts away from hydrophobic core to place the side chain – COO – group in the aqueous region . This shift causes reduced embedding of β 3 TMD and decreased β 3 TMD tilting angle . 8 Talin and kindlin in integrin activation Silencing talin in megakaryocytes inhibits agonist - induced integrin activation [ 76 ] , and disruption of talin - β tail interactions with mutations in either THD or β tail abolishes the capacity of THD to activate integrins [ 75 , 77 , 78 ] . In in vitro systems , recombinant THD alone is suf ﬁ cient to activate α IIb β 3 reconstituted in both liposomes and phospholipid nanodiscs , and shift the α IIb β 3 toward an extended conformation [ 75 ] . Studies in animal models con ﬁ rmed the role of talin in integrin regulation . Knocking in a mutant talin defective in binding to β tail substantially reduces the ability of talin to strengthen integrin adhesion to the ECM in Drosophila [ 79 ] . In mouse platelets , genetic ablation of talin severely impairs agonist - induced integrin activation and platelet aggregation [ 73 , 74 ] . Furthermore , a point mutation in β 3 integrin ( L746A ) that selectively disrupts the talin - integrin interaction , or one in talin ( L325R ) that selectively inhibits the capacity of talin to activate integrins , blocks integrin activation and platelet aggregation [ 80 , 81 ] . Thus , talin binding to the integrin β cytoplasmic tail is a ﬁ nal common step for integrin activation [ 76 ] . Recent work from multiple laboratories has elucidated the mechanisms of talin - induced integrin activation at molecular details . Talin binds to two sites on integrin β tails : a strong binding site centered around the ﬁ rst NPxY motif that contributes most of the binding free energy and a weak membrane proximal ( MP ) binding site that is dependent on the interaction with the NPxY motif [ 77 ] . In addition , talin also binds to negatively charged phospholipids through the positively - charged residues on the surface of THD [ 77 , 82 , 83 ] . The weak interaction at the MP region is a critical differentiating factor for the unique integrin - activating capacity of talin for two reasons : ( 1 ) it brings talin Lys324 close to Asp723 of the β tail , thus neutralizing some charge of Asp723 , weakening the Arg995 - Asp723 electrostatic inter - actions at IMC and favoring integrin activation [ 83 ] ; ( 2 ) it stabilizes α - helix formation of the β MP region and extends a continuous β TMD - tail helix into the MP region [ 77 , 83 ] . As talin binds to integrin tails and phospholipids , it tilts the rigid continuous β TMD - tail helix further into the membrane , increasing the tilting angle of β TMD ( Fig . 3 ) [ 84 ] . Such talin - induced motion was shown by increased ﬂ uorescence of solvatochromic dyes attached to the N - or C - terminal of β TMD in the presence of THD [ 84 ] and is further supported by molecular dynamics simulations [ 85 ] . As described earlier , non - optimal tilting angle destabilizes α - β TMD interactions and shifts the equilibrium toward an activated integrin conformation . The talin - lipid interaction is another critical factor for talin to function as a direct integrin activator , as mutations blocking these interactions or solubilization of integrin in detergent micelle abolishes talin ’ s capacity to activate integrins [ 75 , 77 , 83 ] . As expected , introducing a ﬂ exible proline kink in the middle of the β TMD decouples the TMD C - terminal tilting motion from the N - terminal one , and blocks THD - induced integrin activation [ 84 ] ( Fig . 3 ) . Kindlins further tip the balance of integrin activation Kindlins , a family of cytoplasmic proteins that bind to integrin β tails , are another group of important regulators for integrin activation [ 36 , 86 ] . A kindlin ortholog , UNC - 112 , co - localizes with integrins and is required for the organization of integrins at muscle body wall junctions in C . elegans [ 87 ] . There are three mammalian kindlin orthologs : kindlin - 1 ( also known as URP1 for UNC - 112 - related protein ) , kindlin - 2 ( Mig - 2 ) , and kindlin - 3 ( URP2 ) [ 88 ] . Mutations in and depletion of kindlin - 1 result in impaired β 1 integrin function and defective epithelial cell attachment to the extracellular matrix [ 89 , 90 ] . Genetic ablation of kindlin - 2 in mice inhibits β 1 integrin activation and results in embryonic lethality due to severe detachment of the endoderm and epiblast from the basement membrane , phenotypes similar to that of β 1 null mice [ 91 ] . Paradoxically , overexpression of kindlin - 1 or kindlin - 2 dramatically inhibits THD - induced β 1 integrin activation , and Harburger et al . suggested that kindlin might function as a scaffold in β 1 regulation [ 92 ] . In contrast , overexpressed kindlin - 1 and kindlin - 2 strongly enhance THD - induced α IIb β 3 activation , although they have little effect by themselves [ 92 , 93 ] . The mechanism for these Fig . 3 Talin activates integrin by causing a topology change in β 3 TMD . ( A ) Talin stabilizes the helix in the membrane proximal region of β 3 and increases the tilting angle of the continuous β 3 TMD . ( B ) A711P mutation introduces a ﬂ exible kink that breaks the continuous β 3 TMD , decouples the tilting motion of the two helices , and blocks integrin activation . Feng Ye et al . 9 integrin speci ﬁ c effects of kindlin is still unknown . Loss of kindlin - 3 causes defects in the activation of multiple integrin classes in a number of hematopoietic cell types [ 94 – 99 ] . Thus kindlins regulate integrin activation . There has been progress in understanding the requirement of kindlin interacting motifs and partners for its integrin - regulating function . Kindlins bind to the second NxxY / F motif on integrin β tails that is distinctive from the talin binding site , and this interaction is required for kindlin to regulate integrin activation and for kindlin localization to focal adhesions [ 92 , 93 , 99 , 100 ] . Kindlins are FERM domain proteins based on sequence homology . The kindlin FERM domain is divided into F0 , F1 , F2 , and F3 subdomains ; the F2 subdomain is separated into two halves by a pleckstrin homology ( PH ) domain [ 36 , 86 ] . The PH domain is required for kindlin to promote integrin activation as deletion of PH domain inhibits kindlin - 2 - induced activation of β 1 integrins in podocytes [ 101 ] and α IIb β 3 in CHO cells [ 93 , 102 , 103 ] . Three groups independently reported that the kindlin - 2 PH domain preferentially binds to PIP3 and suggested that this PIP3 - PH domain interaction is important for proper kindlin function [ 101 , 103 , 104 ] . Another group reported substantially lower af ﬁ nities between kindlin PH domains and phosphoi - nositides and the af ﬁ nities are further reduced in a phosphate buffer [ 102 ] . The authors instead suggested that it is not an inositol phosphate but another phosphorylated species that might be the interaction partner of kindlin - 1 PH domain [ 102 ] . Kindlin F0 is also required for kindlin to function as an integrin activator , because deletion of this region strongly inhibits the capacity of kindlin - 1 to enhance THD - induced α IIb β 3 activation [ 105 ] . A more recent report suggested that kindlin F0 domain functions by mediating kindlin binding to PIP2 [ 106 ] . In addition , kindlin function depends on a conserved lipid binding loop in kindlin F1 [ 107 ] . Thus the emerging picture is that the lipid - kindlin interactions , mediated by multiple kindlin subdomains and speci ﬁ c lipid species , are critical for kindlin function . In cells , kindlins alone have little effect and can only synergize with talin to activate integrins [ 92 , 93 ] . A number of recent reviews have attempted to explain this phenomenon [ 36 , 86 , 108 ] . One attractive idea is that kindlin can promote recruitment of talin to integrins . However , recent studies found that kindlin does not increase bi - molecular ﬂ uores - cence complementation between talin and integrin in CHO cells , nor does it increase binding between talin and β 3 tails in vitro [ 109 , 110 ] . Furthermore , recombinant kindlin - 3 does not alter the β 3 TMD tilting angle , the mechanism by which talin activates integrins , nor does it enhance the tilting angle changes induced by talin [ 84 ] . Thus kindlins may function by a mechanism distinct from that of talin . There has been progress in understanding the different regulatory mechanisms by talin and kindlin . Talin is required for integrin - mediated slow rolling of neutrophils on blood vessels , which measures the initial activation of integrins ; whereas , kindlin - 3 is dispensable for such slow rolling [ 111 ] . Both talin and kindlin - 3 are required for neutrophil arrest , which correlates with integrins in a high af ﬁ nity state [ 111 ] . Similarly , in T cells , integrin - kindlin - 3 interaction is dis - pensable for initial integrin - ligand binding but is necessary for the strengthening of the integrin - ligand bonds into ﬁ rm adhesion [ 112 ] . Margadant et al . reported that the talin - integrin interaction , but not the kindlin - integrin interaction , regulates α 5 β 1 activation ; whereas kindlin - integrin interac - tion plays a separate and distinct role in regulating α 5 β 1 degradation and recycling [ 113 ] . A recent work showed that kindlins have little primary effect on af ﬁ nity of individual α IIb β 3 but increase multivalent ligand binding by promoting the clustering of talin - activated α IIb β 3 ( Fig . 4 ) [ 114 ] . Furthermore , kindlin - 3 induces integrin α L β 2 clustering in a T cell line [ 115 ] . This model , that kindlins promote clustering of talin - activated integrins ( Fig . 4 ) [ 114 ] , explains why kindlins have little effect in the absence of talin [ 92 , 93 ] , why kindlins can synergize with talin to activate integrins [ 92 , 93 ] and why kindlins are required for ﬁ rm adhesions but not for initial talin - dependent ligand binding [ 111 , 112 ] . It will be interesting to see if this mechanism of kindlin function can be generalized to other integrins . Another unexplained but interesting phenomenon is the integrin - and cell - speci ﬁ c effects of kindlins . Loss of kindlin - 3 in LAD - III eliminates LFA - 1 but not VLA - 4 adhesiveness developed under shear ﬂ ow conditions [ 116 ] . Kindlin - 1 or kindlin - 2 synergize with THD in promoting α IIb β 3 activation but dramatically inhibit THD - induced activation of α 5 β 1 in CHO cells [ 92 ] . Kindlin - 3 neither localizes to nor activates α IIb β 3 in CHO cells , but activates α 5 β 1 in a macrophage cell line [ 99 ] . In β 1 null keratinocytes , kindlin - 1 , but not kindlin - 2 , localizes to the integrin - β 6 - rich adhesions , and kindlin - 1 cannot compensate the defects resulted from kindlin - 2 depletion , despite the high homology of the two kindlin isoforms [ 100 ] . What cause the kindlins to associate differently with integrins in the same cell is still unknown . Kindlins have functions other than regulating integrin Fig . 4 Model for talin and kindlin function . Talin promotes af ﬁ nity increase of individual integrin molecules . Kindlins have little primary effect on af ﬁ nity of individual integrin but increase multivalent ligand binding by promoting the clustering of talin - activated α IIb β 3 . 10 Talin and kindlin in integrin activation activation . For example , kindlins also affect integrin surface expression . Overexpression of kindlin - 1 or kindlin - 2 increases α IIb β 3 expression levels in CHO cells [ 92 ] . Genetic ablation of kindlin - 3 reduces surface α IIb β 3 in platelets by 25 % [ 99 ] . This may be due to altered integrin mRNA levels as recently shown by Bottcher et al . in the kindlin - 2 null cell [ 117 ] . Kindlin and sorting nexin 17 ( SNX17 ) , an integrin binding protein that controls the recycling of integrins , have overlapping binding sites on integrin β 1 tail [ 113 , 117 ] . Thus mutations to the kindlin binding sites also affect integrin - SNX17 interactions and therefore interfere with the integrin recycling pathway [ 113 , 117 ] . Furthermore , kindlin binds integrin linked kinase ( ILK ) , an important adaptor protein in integrin outside - in signaling [ 91 , 118 , 119 ] . In kindlin - 2 null cells , ILK is not targeted properly to focal adhesions , suggesting loss of kindlin may also affect integrin outside - in signaling through ILK [ 91 ] . A recent study in C . elegans suggests that PAT - 4 ( ILK ortholog ) enables UNC - 112 ( kindlin - 3 ortholog ) binding to PAT - 3 ( β integrin ortholog ) by changing the conformation of UNC - 112 [ 120 ] . Thus the functions of ILK and kindlins may be mutually dependent . Mig ﬁ lin , a kindlin binding protein that also binds to ﬁ lamin , was initially proposed as a likely switch for kindlin function [ 121 ] . The hypothesis was that kindlins recruit mig ﬁ lin to the integrin β cytoplasmic tail , where mig ﬁ lin displaces the integrin inhibitor , ﬁ lamin . However , mig ﬁ lin null mice do not show similar phenotypes to kindlin de ﬁ cient mice , disfavor - ing the hypothesis [ 122 ] . Integrin activation is a dynamic equilibrium It is worth emphasizing here that the inactive and active integrins exist in a shifting equilibrium . The measured average integrin af ﬁ nity re ﬂ ects the net effects of all the relevant factors on the activation equilibrium . For example , integrins with weakened α - β TMD interactions can be further activated by THD [ 83 ] and can also be reverted by silencing endogenous talin or by mutations blocking talin - integrin or kindlin - integrin interactions [ 76 , 93 ] . β 3 integrin activation induced by a K716E mutation , which alters β TMD tilting angle , can also be partially reverted by mutations blocking talin - integrin interactions [ 65 ] . Integrin clustering and con - formational changes can synergistically enhance multivalent ligand binding to cellular integrins [ 123 ] . Therefore , THD , which increases the af ﬁ nity of individual integrins , and kindlins , which promote integrin clustering , can synergize with each other in activating integrins [ 92 , 93 , 114 ] . Moreover , agents that act via the extracellular domain can synergize with ones acting via the cytoplasmic domain in shifting the conformational equilibrium toward the high af ﬁ nity state [ 114 , 124 , 125 ] . On the other hand , cytoplasmic integrin activators can be antagonized by negative cellular regulators [ 40 ] . Thus , integrin activation is a dynamic process in which factors with opposing effects can cancel each other and factors with the same effects can add to or synergize with each other ( Fig . 5 ) . Integrins in disease Given the important roles of integrins in multiple physiolo - gical processes , it is not surprising to ﬁ nd diseases involving genetic mutations in integrins or integrin regulators . There are well known diseases due to integrin mutations , Glanzmann thrombasthenia ( GT ) and leukocyte adhesion de ﬁ ciency I ( LAD I ) , and to kindlin mutations , LAD III ( kindlin - 3 ) and Kindler syndrome ( kindlin - 1 ) . Glanzmann thrombasthenia is a hereditary hemorrhagic disorder caused by loss of α IIb β 3 expression or function . There are three subsets of genotypes for this disease . The ﬁ rst subset completely loses either α IIb or β 3 expression due to nonsense genetic mutations [ 126 , 127 ] , or has much reduced α IIb β 3 surface expression due to mutations disrupting folding , post - translational processing , or transportation of either α IIb or β 3 [ 128 ] . The second subset of GT patients has normal α IIb β 3 surface expression but carries mutations in the α IIb β 3 extracellular ligand binding pockets or in the β 3 cytoplasmic domain . The former mutations , such as R214W or D119Y , directly block ligand binding [ 129 , 130 ] and the latter ones , such as S752P or R724Ter [ 131 , 132 ] , block integrin activation by preventing the binding of integrin regulators such as talin and kindlin . The third subset of patients carries mutations that lock α IIb β 3 in an activated conformation , including C560R and C598Y in β 3 cysteine rich domains [ 133 , 134 ] . The activated platelet α IIb β 3 is Fig . 5 The dynamic equilibrium of integrin activation functions as signal integrator . The factors that shift the equilibrium to the same direction can add to or synergize with each other . Opposing factors can cancel each other . Feng Ye et al . 11 constitutively occupied by ligand and thus not available to bridge α IIb β 3 receptors from other platelets at the site of a wound . Therefore , these platelets with constitutively active α IIb β 3 fail to aggregate , resulting in prolonged bleeding . Leukocyte adhesion de ﬁ ciency I and III are hereditary immune de ﬁ ciencies characterized by leukocytosis and repeated infections ( LAD II is caused by loss of selectin ligands and thus not integrin - related ) . LAD I is caused by mutations that cause loss of integrin β 2 expression or function . Consequently , leukocytes from LAD I patients fail to ﬁ rmly adhere to the endothelium near the in ﬂ ammation site or interact with antigen presenting cells , both of which are critical for mounting an effective immune response [ 135 ] . LAD III patients carry mutations in kindlin - 3 , resulting in non - functional kindlin - 3 fragment or absence of kindlin - 3 [ 95 , 97 , 98 ] . In the immune cells of LAD III patients , integrin activation in response to agonist stimulation is defective . Consequently , patients ’ leukocytes fail to arrest on the vascular endothelium and are incapable of extravasation to the site of infection . Since kindlin - 3 also plays a role in regulating α IIb β 3 activation , LAD III patients exhibit GT - like symptoms [ 135 ] . Kindler syndrome is a hereditary skin disease caused by nonsense mutations in kindlin - 1 . The disease is characterized by skin blistering , increased skin sensitivity to light , patchy discoloration of the skin and widespread skin breakdown [ 136 , 137 ] . Knockout of kindlin - 1 in mice caused skin atrophy that resembles human Kindler syndrome [ 89 ] . Reduced β 1 integrin activation has been suggested to play a role in this disease because of defective β 1 - mediated keratinocytes adhesion to laminin , collagen or ﬁ bronectin matrix [ 89 ] . Recent work suggested that kindlin - 1 - de ﬁ cient keratinocytes respond to cell stress by upregulating the expression of cytokines , which activate ﬁ broblasts and induce their differentiation into myo ﬁ broblasts , leading to matrix protein deposition and mucocutaneous ﬁ brosis in patients [ 138 ] . Thus , there may also be integrin - independent mechanisms contributing to this disease . Concluding remarks The regulation of integrins is important for development and many physiological and pathological events . Thus , this continues to be an area of intense interest . Exciting progress has been made in identifying the key players and under - standing their mechanisms of action . Nevertheless , important unanswered questions , such as the mechanism of integrin - and cell - speci ﬁ c effects of kindlins , remain . The remarkable progress in the basic understanding of integrin activation may enable the development of new therapies in the future .
