Histo - blood group antigens as mediators of infections Julie E Heggelund 1 , * , Annabelle Varrot 2 , Anne Imberty 2 and Ute Krengel 1 The critical ﬁrst step of a microbial infection is usually the attachment of pathogens to host cell glycans . Targets on host tissues are in particular the histo - blood group antigens ( HBGAs ) , which are present in rich diversity in the mucus layer and on the underlying mucosa . Recent structural and functional studies have revealed signiﬁcant new insight into the molecular mechanisms , explaining why individuals with certain blood groups are at increased risk of some infections . The most prominent example of blood - group - associated diseases is cholera , caused by infection with Vibrio cholerae . Many other microbial pathogens , for example Pseudomonas aeruginosa infecting the airways , and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli ( ETEC ) causing traveler’s diarrhea , also bind to histo - blood group antigens , but show a less clear correlation with blood group phenotype . Yet other pathogens , for example norovirus and Helicobacter pylori , recognize HBGAs differently depending on the strain . In all cases , milk oligosaccharides can aid the hosts’ defenses , acting as natural receptor decoys , and anti - infectious therapy can be designed along similar strategies . In this review , we focus on important infections of humans , but the molecular mechanisms are of general relevance to a broad range of microbial infections of humans and animals .

Once inside the host , either through the airways or the gastrointestinal tract , the pathogens must ﬁght their way to the underlying cells . The mucus layer provides the ﬁrst protective barrier of the underlying tissues ( reviewed by Johansson et al . [ 1 ] ) , and is essentially kept sterile by the constant secre - tion of mucus from goblet cells and the shedding of its top layer . This is true in particular for the colon , which has a second , inner mucus layer that is impermeable to bacte - ria . The mucus consists of a network of heavily glycosy - lated proteins , containing negatively charged carbohy - drates and a signiﬁcant amount of neutral , fucosylated sugars . The underlying mucous membrane , the mucosa , contains glycoconjugates including both lipids and pro - teins , resulting in a dense layer of glycans called the glycocalyx . This layer serves as a protective layer , helping to keep the pathogens at bay . However , many pathogens have evolved an ability to take advantage of these gly - cans , and use them as receptors for host cell adhesion or entry [ 2 , 3 ] . Especially well - characterized carbohydrate - based anti - gens are the histo - blood group antigens ( HBGAs ) , which include the ABH and Lewis antigens . The ABH blood group system is named after the expression of antigens by red blood cells . HBGAs are also present on epithelial and endothelial cells throughout the body , and as soluble oligosaccharides in most body ﬂuids except cerebrospinal ﬂuid . Many pathogens use these antigens to adhere to host cells , and the interplay between pathogens and HBGAs is believed to promote the antigen diversity we see today [ 4 , 5 (cid:1) ] . Individuals have different active glycosyltransferases , leading to a large variety of oligo - saccharides , whose expression varies greatly between tissues and even between tissue parts . A rich display of HBGAs is found in particular in the gastrointestinal tract and in the mucus layer covering it . HBGAs are synthesized from precursor antigens and modiﬁed by the actions of different glycosyltransferases ( Figure 1 ; reviewed by Marionneau et al . [ 4 ] ) . The sim - plest ABH antigens are the H antigens characteristic of blood group O , which can be converted into A or B antigens by the action of the A or B glycosyltransferases , respectively . ABH and precursor antigens can be fucosy - lated on GlcNAc , creating the Lewis antigens . The fuco - syltransferase Secretor / FUT2 can add the so - called Secre - tor fucose . This enzyme is lacking in 20 % of the European and North American population , resulting in the so - called non - secretor phenotype characterized by the absence of all ABH antigens from mucus and secretions like saliva Available online at www . sciencedirect . com ScienceDirect www . sciencedirect . com Current Opinion in Structural Biology , : 1 – 11 and human milk . Nevertheless , non - secretors can still express the simplest fucosylated Lewis antigens . In addi - tion , symbiotic host microbes are known to contribute to intestinal fucosylation [ 6 (cid:1) ] . The severity and susceptibility of many infectious dis - eases correlate with blood group phenotype [ 7 ] . So far , the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon has been very limited . This has changed recently with the determination of several high - resolution crystal structures of relevant protein - HBGA complexes . The gained insights are the topic of this review . Infections of the gastrointestinal tract Infection by enteric pathogens generally occurs through the fecal – oral route , caused by poor hygiene , consump - tion of contaminated food or water , or by exposure to 2 Carbohydrates Figure 1 α 1 , 3 / 4 f u c o sy l t r an s f e r a s e ( Le w i s gene ) α 1 , 2 f u c o sy l t r an s f e r a s e ( S e c r e t o r gene ) α 1 , 3 / 4 f u c o sy l t r an s f e r a s e α 1 , 3 / 4 f u c o sy l t r an s f e r a s e Type 1 / 2 precursor Gal β 3 / 4GlcNAc β - Gal β 3 / 4 ( Fuc α4 / 3 ) GlcNAc β - Fuc α 2Gal β 3 / 4GlcNAc β - Fuc α 2Gal β 3 / 4 ( Fuc α4 / 3 ) GlcNAc β - Gal α 3 ( Fuc α 2 ) Gal β 3 / 4GlcNAc β - GalNAc α 3 ( Fuc α 2 ) Gal β 3 / 4GlcNAc β - GalNAc α 3 ( Fuc α 2 ) Gal β 3 / 4 ( Fuc α4 / 3 ) GlcNAc β - Gal α 3 ( Fuc α 2 ) Gal β 3 / 4 ( Fuc α4 / 3 ) GlcNAc β - Non - secretors Secretors α4 / 3 α4 / 3 α4 / 3 α4 / 3 α 2 α 2 α 2 α 2 α 2 α 2 H type 1 / 2 A type 1 / 2 B type 1 / 2 Lewis a / x Lewis b / y B Lewis b / y A Lewis b / y A or B glycosyltransferases Current Opinion in Structural Biology Biosynthetic pathways of type 1 and type 2 human histo - blood group antigens ( HBGAs ) .

Some pathogens , such as Helicobacter pylori , are in addition transmitted through the oral – oral route , and others , for example Vibrio cholerae , can also survive in aquatic reser - voirs , without any contact with feces . Viral infections Noroviruses ( NoVs ) and rotaviruses ( RVs ) are the two most important causes of acute gastroenteritis in humans . Both of them are ‘non - enveloped’ viruses , which means that they are encased by a protein capsid lacking a lipid envelope . Viruses replicate and evolve very rapidly , giving rise to a large number of different strains with different receptor proﬁles that enable them to conquer different niches ( reviewed by Refs [ 8 (cid:1) , 9 (cid:1) , 10 , 11 (cid:1) ] ) . Among their known cellular receptors are sialylated structures and HBGAs . Secretors are particularly susceptible to NoV and RV infections [ 12 ] . These individuals express HBGAs in their body ﬂuids , mucus and gastrointestinal epithelial cells , therefore it is plausible that they are at higher risk of infection . While many children in the world are routinely vaccinated against RV infections , there is currently no vaccine against NoV infection . The ﬁrst examples of human pathogens , for which the molecular basis of blood group dependence was eluci - dated , are NoVs [ 13 , 14 (cid:1) ] . They are single - stranded RNA viruses belonging to the Caliciviridae . Both major NoV genogroups , GI and GII , are known to infect humans and bind HBGAs in the high micromolar range [ 15 ] . GI includes the well - known Norwalk virus , causing win - ter - vomiting disease . This genogroup mainly targets indi - viduals with blood group O , while people with blood group B have a lower risk of infection [ 16 ] . In contrast , GII NoVs do not discriminate between different blood groups [ 17 , 18 ] . The ﬁrst X - ray structure of a NoV was published in 1999 ( PDB 1IHM [ 19 (cid:1) ] ) . Its viral capsid contains dimeric P domains , which project out from the icosahe - dral shells and are responsible for the binding to the host cell receptors ( Figure 2a and b ) . Intriguingly , the P domains ( and in particular the receptor - binding P2 sub - domains ) have a much lower sequence identity than the overall genomes of GI and GII NoVs ( approximately 25 % ( P2 ) compared to 50 % overall [ 11 (cid:1) , 13 ] ) . Moreover , the receptor binding sites are positioned at different locations at the P dimerization interface and have distinct structural characteristics [ 14 (cid:1) , 8 (cid:1) , 10 ] ( Figure 2b – d ) . GI viruses bind HBGAs end - on and recognize mainly the terminal b - Gal residue of blood group H - antigens ( Figure 2c ) . Additional interactions are found to the Secretor fucose , which include hydrophobic interactions to a conserved trypto - phan residue , kept in place by cation - p stacking to a histidine . In A or B antigens , the b - Gal binding site is instead occupied by the terminal a - GalNAc or a - Gal residues characteristic for blood groups A and B , respec - tively , whereas the fucose residue is reoriented away from the conserved tryptophan into a secondary binding pocket ( Figure 2c ) . In A antigens , the N - acetyl group of the terminal a - GalNAc residue mimics the interactions of the Secretor fucose ( Figure 2c ) , whereas a - Gal , charac - teristic of B antigens , lacks these additional interactions and binds poorly to GI NoVs , explaining why individuals with blood group B experience protection . GII NoVs mainly recognize a - fucose , present either as Secretor or Lewis fucose in a large variety of HBGAs [ 20 , 21 , 22 (cid:1) , 23 , 24 , 25 (cid:1) ] ( Figure 2d ) . It is therefore not surprising that GII NoVs exhibit a broad ABH blood group proﬁle . Signiﬁcantly less is known about RVs , both in terms of epidemiology and molecular mechanisms . RVs are dou - ble - stranded RNA viruses of the Reoviridae family , which form much larger viral particles than NoVs . VP8 * , a subunit of the outer capsid protein VP4 , is the functional equivalent of NoV’s P domain ( Figure 2e and f ) . VP8 * has a galectin fold , a fold known to recognize b - Gal . How - ever , in RVs the galactose binding site is blocked and a different site is involved in receptor recognition . For several decades , sialic acid has been known as the key cellular receptor of RVs , whereas the binding of HBGAs to certain RV strains was discovered only recently [ 26 , 27 ] . Nevertheless , the limited data that exist suggest that secretors are signiﬁcantly more susceptible to RV infec - tions than non - secretors [ 12 ] , indicating that HBGAs may indeed be functional RV receptors . In 2012 , a crystal structure of VP8 * was reported in complex with a blood group A - trisaccharide [ 28 (cid:1) ] , occupying the same site that binds sialic acid in other RV strains . The major interac - tions were to the a - GalNAc characteristic of blood group A and additional interactions to b - Gal , whereas the Secre - tor - fucose faced away from the HBGA binding site ( Figure 2f ) . Nevertheless , glycan array data showed that this residue strongly enhances receptor binding [ 28 (cid:1) ] , which may be due to intramolecular conformational sta - bilization . Overall , binding speciﬁcity varies greatly between different RV strains , and even strains binding the same antigens exhibit considerable variation in molecular recognition [ 26 , 27 , 29 ] . Differences in the width of the receptor cleft may play a role in the different binding properties [ 10 ] . The structural adaptability of the VP8 * binding site , including receptor - induced conforma - tional changes , may furthermore lie at the heart of recep - tor - release prior to cell entry [ 22 (cid:1) ] and of interspecies transmission [ 27 , 30 ] . Bacterial infections Many bacteria use lectins to attach to host cells ( reviewed in this issue by Moonens and Remaut [ 31 (cid:1) ] ) . One notable example is Helicobacter pylori , responsible for inducing stomach ulcers and gastric cancer . More than half of the world population is infected with this bacterium , which was declared a class I carcinogen by the WHO in 1994 . The most virulent H . pylori strains mediate adhe - sion to the human host via the Blood group Antigen Binding Adhesin , BabA [ 32 ] , which is present in large Histo - blood group antigens as mediators of infections Heggelund et al . 3 www . sciencedirect . com Current Opinion in Structural Biology , : 1 – 11 4 Carbohydrates Figure 2 ( a ) ( b ) ( c ) ( d ) ( e ) ( f ) Fuc Fuc Gal Gal GIcNAc Current Opinion in Structural Biology HBGA recognition by noro - and rotaviruses .

Different H . pylori strains exhibit distinct blood group proﬁles [ 33 ] : in populations with high incidence of the blood group O phenotype , such as the natives of South America , spe - cialist species predominate , while in Europe and the USA , which have a more diverse blood group pattern , generalist species of H . pylori are able to bind all three ABH blood group antigens . The different binding proﬁles are correlated with the presence of BabA variants with different speciﬁcities for ABH / Lewis glycans . Moonens et al . recently solved the crystal structures of several of these BabA variants in complexes with various HBGAs , revealing the molecular basis of this phenomenon [ 34 (cid:1)(cid:1) ] . BabA’s interaction with host receptors is three - pronged ( Figure 3a ) : ( i ) Its main anchor is the Secretor fucose , which is bound by a loop stabilized by a redox - sensitive disulﬁde bond called Cys - clasped Loop CL2 , involving hydrogen bonds to several highly conserved amino acid residues . ( ii ) The Asp - Ser - Ser triad of the Diversiﬁcation Loop DL2 speciﬁcally binds type 1 glycan receptors , ensuring tropism for the foveolar epithelium , which cov - ers the inside of the stomach . ( iii ) Blood group A / B - speciﬁc a - GalNAc / Gal residues bind to a shallow pocket in the DL1 region . O - speciﬁc H . pylori strains exhibit a distinct sequence variation in this loop , where a proline in combination with a bulky residue ( such as Asn , Asp , or Leu ) sterically interferes with generalist binding . Addi - tional phenotypes are the AB specialists , which bind more tightly to A / B - speciﬁc glycans due to additional interac - tions of the terminal a - GalNAc / Gal residues with DL1 , and the inverse specialists , which bind A / B - rather than O - speciﬁc glycans despite exhibiting the bulky Pro - Leu sequence , since a non - functional DL2 loop allows for a slight rotation that prevents the steric clash ( Figure 3a ) . Cholera is arguably the most well - known example of blood - group - associated diseases . For 50 years , individuals with blood group O have been known to experience more severe symptoms than those with other blood groups [ 35 ] , although paradoxically they are less likely to be infected . The main culprit is the cholera toxin ( CT ) , which after gaining entry to host cells , hijacks the host’s own endogenous pathways to trigger the opening of ion channels , inducing the massive secretory diarrhea typical of the disease . Secretors experience protection from cholera [ 36 ] , which is in contrast to many other diseases . In the past few years , great strides were made in under - standing the blood group association of cholera on a detailed molecular level . The primary receptor of the CT is the GM1 ganglioside , which binds to the toxin with nanomolar afﬁnity [ 37 ] . That CT can also bind to HBGAs or analogs of these has been shown only recently [ 38 , 39 ] . Studies of chimera of the receptor - binding subunits of CT and the homologous heat - labile toxin ( LT ) from enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli ( ETEC ) indicated that the toxins may harbor a second binding site [ 40 , 41 ] , for HBGAs , that is spatially distinct from the GM1 binding site ( Figure 3b ) . Subsequently , the crystal structure of LT was determined in complex with a blood - group - A - speciﬁc human milk oligosaccharide ( HMO ) resembling A - Lewis y , sparking a discussion as to why ETEC infections nevertheless do not show a strong blood group association [ 42 (cid:1) ] . This is probably due to interference with LPS : in contrast to the CT , which is secreted as a soluble toxin , LT remains attached to outer membrane vesicles via LPS . Indications are that the binding sites for HBGAs and LPS overlap , interfering with LT binding to HBGAs [ 43 ] , which would explain the lack of blood group associ - ation for ETEC infections . For cholera , conﬂicting data were published regarding the binding of two natural CT variants to HBGAs and HMO analogs [ 38 , 39 , 44 ] . The breakthrough came last year with the high - resolution structures of respective CT - complexes [ 45 (cid:1)(cid:1) ] ( Figure 3b ) and supporting cell biological experiments [ 46 ] , explaining all previous ﬁndings . Unexpectedly the blood group A determinant ( and its HMO analog ) bound in the opposite orientation compared to LT , showing that subtle amino acid differences in the secondary binding site can considerably modulate binding . Another unexpected result was the binding of H - determinants ( Lewis y and its HMO - analog ) in two alternative orienta - tions . This rationalized the stronger binding of O - speciﬁc glycans compared to A - and B - determinants , where the A / B - speciﬁc a - GalNAc / Gal residues can only be accom - modated in one of the orientations . Again a fucose residue ( generally the Lewis fucose ) was shown to play the central role in binding , connecting two adjacent CT subunits . Even though binding afﬁnities to HBGAs are only in the millimolar range and hence signiﬁcantly weaker than to GM1 [ 45 (cid:1)(cid:1) , 37 ] , CT is capable of cooperatively binding these ligands with all ﬁve of its receptor - binding subunits , permitting high - avidity interaction with its target tissue . Stronger binding of the toxin to O - speciﬁc compared to A / B - speciﬁc glycans is consistent with the observed blood group proﬁle of cholera . What remains to be further investigated is why secretors are protected . Other enteric pathogens known to bind HBGAs are Campylobacter jejuni [ 47 ] and Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium [ 48 ] , although structural data regarding these interactions are not yet available .

( a ) Molecular basis of H . pylori adaptation to human HBGA polymorphism . The H . pylori adhesin BabA binds to HBGAs with three loops ( DL1 , CL2 , DL2 ) , displaying significant variation between different strains . For example , ABO generalists can accommodate the a - Gal ( green sticks ) or a - GalNAc residues ( not shown ) characteristic of B or A antigens , respectively , whereas bulky residues in DL1 prevent HBGA binding due to steric interference , leading to O - specialists ( close - up view ) . This panel is reproduced with permission from [ 31 (cid:1) ] . ( b ) Molecular basis of cholera blood group dependence . The culprit is the cholera toxin ( CT ; cartoon representation ) , which binds to HBGAs ( box ) and GM1 ( green sticks ; PDB 3CHB [ 79 ] ) . Several CT structures are superimposed .

Note that H - tetra can bind in two orientations , whereas the A - pentasaccharide ( BGA or HMO ) binds in a single orientation ( Se Fuc , Secretor fucose ; Le Fuc , Lewis fucose ) .

The glycosylation of mucuschanges during thecourseof pathologies , althoughit is not yet clear whether the changes are due to the disease itself , to associated inﬂammation or due to the presence of microbes [ 49 – 51 ] . Modiﬁcations in fucosylation , sulfatation and sialylation are generally observed in cystic ﬁbrosis , but with different trends depending on N - or O - glycosylation . Opportunistic pathogens , often associated with hospital environments , include bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeru - ginosa and members of the Burkholderia complexes , and airborne fungi such as Aspergillus fumigatus . All of these pathogens bind to HBGAs , but so far only P . aeruginosa has been investigated for correlation between blood group and host susceptibility . P . aeruginosa infection is the leading cause of death of cystic ﬁbrosis patients , and also affects immunocompro - mised patients . Conﬂicting data exist regarding its possi - ble correlation with blood group phenotype . While the analysis of gene polymorphism in cystic ﬁbrosis patients did not reveal any correlation between severity of P . aeruginosa infection and ABH , secretor or Lewis geno - types [ 52 ] , other studies indicated a stronger susceptibil - ity to P . aeruginosa sepsis in children with blood group B [ 53 ] and a correlation of external otitis with blood groups A or B [ 54 ] . P . aeruginosa interacts with host glycans mainly via two soluble lectins , the a - galactose speciﬁc LecA and the fucose - speciﬁc LecB , which have both been structurally characterized [ 55 ] . The LecA target is likely the a Gal1 – 4Gal disaccharide present on globotriao - sylceramide ( Gb3 ) and blood group P k and P 1 antigens [ 56 ] . LecA binding to Gb3 triggers the uptake of the bacterium into airway cells in vitro [ 57 ] . LecB has a very strong afﬁnity for fucose due to the rare chelation of two calcium ions , and its best - known ligand is the Lewis a epitope . Two recent studies investigated the variations of LecB genes in more than 200 bacterial strains originating from natural or clinical environments [ 58 , 59 (cid:1)(cid:1) ] . Sequence analysis revealed two main clusters that could be identi - ﬁed as PAO1 - like and PA14 - like . The fucose binding site is conserved in all strains , with 13 % variations of sequences between PAO1 and P14 . Crystal structures and afﬁnity analysis of two variants from PA14 [ 59 (cid:1)(cid:1) ] and PA7 [ 58 ] strains conﬁrmed that binding to fucose is conserved , indicating the importance of LecB for these bacteria . Furthermore , multivalent epitope presentation was shown to be critical . For example , the LecB variant from the pathogenic PA14 strain binds with very high afﬁnity ( K d = 25 nM ) to a biantennary N - glycan present - ing two blood group H epitopes , corresponding to an afﬁnity that is 10 - fold higher than for isolated H - type 2 oligosaccharide ( K d = 200 nM ) [ 59 (cid:1)(cid:1) ] . The fucose - speciﬁc six - bladed b - propeller fold repre - sents another lectin family identiﬁed in lung pathogens , that is , B . ambifaria ( BambL ) [ 60 ] and A . fumigatus ( AFL or FleA ) [ 61 ] . The biological role of these lectins is not yet entirely clear . For example , AFL was demonstrated to contribute to inﬂammation [ 61 ] , but also stimulated macrophage killing , thus protecting the host [ 62 (cid:1) ] . The 6 - bladed b - propeller fold is formed by a tandem repeat of one single chain in fungi or by trimerization of a much shorter chain in bacteria ( Figure 4a and b ) . In AFL , the six binding sites exhibit minor differences in amino acid composition with variations in oligosaccharide preference as observed by soaking of crystals in a mixture of oligo - saccharides [ 63 (cid:1) ] . Nevertheless , both bacterial and fungal family members bind fucose in a unique conserved bind - ing mode involving hydrogen bonds between an arginine and the O4 hydroxyl or ring oxygens , and between a Glu / Gln residue and the O3 and O4 hydroxyls as well as a CH - p interaction with a Tyr / Trp residue ( Figure 4c – f ) . The general preference for blood group O ( H - type 2 ) and Lewis y was rationalized through molecular modeling [ 64 ] , showing that the binding pockets are well oriented for multivalent binding of terminal a Fuc1 – 2Gal epitopes ( Figure 4d ) . Apart for its preference for Lewis y , AFL binds to all fucosylated oligosaccharides , and therefore to all tissues expressing Lewis and ABH antigens . The a Fuc1 - 3GlcNAc disaccharide present in Lewis x / y is also recognized , and analysis of the crystal complexes led to the surprising observation that the ‘closed’ conformation , observed in solution , solid state and modeling [ 65 ] , is forced into an ‘open’ conformation when entering the binding sites ( Figure 4e – f ) . A conserved aromatic residue appears to be responsible for guiding the fucose into the binding site by separating the fucose and galactose rings that are stacked together in solution [ 66 (cid:1)(cid:1) ] . Opening of the canonical Lewis x conformation apparently involves the transient distortion of the central N - acetyl - glucos - amine ring , as shown by crystal structures of another family member , Ralstonia solanacearum lectin ( RSL ) , in complexes with Lewis x and sialyl - Lewis x , combined with extensive molecular dynamics simulations [ 66 (cid:1)(cid:1) ] . Fighting back : glycans , glycocompounds and glycomimetics as anti - infectious agents Anti - infectious strategies can be based on competition with the attachment of pathogens to HBGAs on target tissues . Such protection is provided naturally by human milk , which contains a large variety of fucosylated and sialylated oligosaccharides ( HMOs ) . These soluble oligosaccharides protect newborns from infections in a dual fashion , as anti - microbials and prebiotics [ 6 (cid:1) , 67 (cid:1) ] . Interesting examples , where structural information is available , are cholera [ 44 , 45 (cid:1)(cid:1) ] and norovirus infections [ 68 ] . Building on the accumulated structural knowledge of lectin - oligosaccharide interactions , it has been possible to design glycomimetics with increased afﬁnities for lectin receptors , achieving a stronger competition effect [ 69 ] . Classical strategies are centered on optimizing the binding energy between protein and carbohydrates , that Histo - blood group antigens as mediators of infections Heggelund et al . 7 www . sciencedirect . com Current Opinion in Structural Biology , : 1 – 11 is , increasing the enthalpy of binding by maximizing the number of hydrogen bonds and / or hydrophobic contacts , and decreasing the entropy contribution by reducing the ﬂexibility of the oligosaccharide . For example , the careful design of the aglycone ( = non - sugar ) part of a fucose derivative signiﬁcantly increased the selectivity for its target B . cenocepacia BambL [ 70 ] . Similarly , a fucopyrano - side glycomimetic inhibitor of A . fumigatus FleA was shown to inhibit binding and phagocytosis of conidia by macrophages [ 62 (cid:1) ] . Another strategy is to design multivalent ligands that simultaneously bind to several binding sites of a multiva - lent receptor , resulting in a strong gain in avidity ( = appar - ent multivalent afﬁnity ) [ 71 (cid:1) , 72 (cid:1) ] . A successful example is a divalent galactoside ligand of P . aeruginosa LecA , which was able to lower the cellular invasiveness of the bacteria by up to 90 % by chelating two neighboring receptor binding sites [ 73 ] . Other examples are the prevention of human immunodeﬁciency virus ( HIV ) transmission by glycodendrimers [ 74 ] and the design of multivalent inhi - bitors against bacterial toxins [ 72 (cid:1) ] . Based on high - throughput screening of compounds libraries , both in vitro and in silico , it is also possible to identify non - carbohydrate glycomimetics able to compete in carbohy - drate binding sites , as accomplished for noroviruses [ 75 ] . Yet another possibility is the design of HBGA - blocking antibodies as therapeutic agents ( [ 76 ] and references therein ) . Conclusions and perspective A large variety of human pathogens recognize blood group antigens . These include viruses , bacteria and fungi , which employ viral coat proteins , microbial adhesins , soluble lectins and toxins to invade and conquer their hosts [ 2 ] . In this review , we focus on human infections of the gastrointestinal tract and the airways . A common microbial strategy is to use HBGA binding for attachment and entry to the host cells . Secretors , who display these antigens on tissues exposed to the external environment and on their mucus , nurture symbionts [ 6 (cid:1) ] but are also disproportionally affected by infectious diseases ( how - ever , as described below , hosts have their own measures to force selective pressures onto microbes , e . g . , through blood group polymorphism , to prevent the eradication of entire populations [ 4 , 5 (cid:1) ] ) . Another microbial strategy is to 8 Carbohydrates Figure 4 ( a ) ( b ) ( c ) ( d ) ( e ) ( f ) Trp198 Tyr192 Thr150 Glu138 Arg126 Fuc GlcNAc GlcNAc GlcNAc Gal Gal Gal Gal Fuc Fuc Fuc Fuc Current Opinion in Structural Biology HBGA - pathogen interactions of selected airway infections .

Current Opinion in Structural Biology , : 1 – 11 www . sciencedirect . com employ HBGA - binding toxins . Not discussed in this review is the molecular mechanism of parasitical malaria infection , where adhesins facilitate erythrocyte rosetting by binding primarily to blood group A antigens [ 77 ] , explaining why individuals with blood group A are most severely affected by this disease . This has consequences on a population level , due to natural selection and evo - lution . The Ganges delta , for example , where both malaria and cholera are endemic , has a unique blood group proﬁle , with the highest percentage of blood group B in the world . Blood group polymorphism is an important asset for surviving in this world [ 4 ] . Microbes respond by evolving many strains with different binding properties , but the hosts can ﬁght back . Of particular importance is the continuously renewing mucus layer , which nurtures symbionts and helps expel pathogens [ 1 , 6 (cid:1) ] . Another trick is human milk , which mimics HBGAs , serving as non - degradable receptor decoy protecting human infants [ 67 (cid:1) ] . The high fucose - content of human milk is likely of particular importance for the protective effect . Modi - ﬁed oligosaccharides , glycomimetics and dendrimers work in a similar way , with potential as medications and prophylactics [ 69 , 72 (cid:1) ] . Enveloped viruses like inﬂu - enza virus and HIV take their host’s membrane coats along on their journey to a new victim . This provides them with disguise , but can also elicit immune reactions against foreign blood groups . The molecular arms race is on , and we are now beginning to understand its molecular underpinnings , providing us with new tools to ﬁght disease .
