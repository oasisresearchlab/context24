Defects in nuclear envelope assembly during mitotic exit make micronuclei prone to rupture in the subsequent interphase 1 , 2 . Unlike primary nuclei where resealing takes minutes , ruptures at micronuclei are almost always irrevers - ible and culminate in catastrophic nuclear envelope collapse with permanent loss of micronucleus - cytoplasmic compartmentaliza - tion 2 . Micronuclear catastrophe is associated with the activation of cGAS – cGAMP – STING pro - inflammatory signalling in response to prolonged exposure of the DNA to the cytosol 3 – 5 . In addition , it is accompanied by fragmentation of the underlying chromosome and chromothripsis 6 – 8 , a process generating extensive clustered genome rearrangements that are frequently observed in cancer 9 and thought to be a major driver of cancer genome evolution 10 , 11 . Why ruptured micronuclei are not repaired and what processes contribute to their collapse and chromosome fragmentation remain major unanswered questions . At primary nuclei , nuclear compartmentalization is safeguarded by the endosomal sorting complex required for transport - III ( ESCRT - III ) 12 – 15 , a molecular machinery that forms membrane - bound filaments to promote membrane fission or sealing in a range of cellular processes 16 , 17 . Recruitment of ESCRT - III to the nuclear envelope requires binding of the inner nuclear membrane protein LEMD2 to CHMP7 , the nuclear envelope - specific ESCRT - III recruitment factor 12 , 18 – 21 . Following nucleation , soluble monomeric ESCRT - III subunits polymerize into filaments at the site of rup - ture to drive membrane sealing 14 , 15 , 22 . Competent ESCRT - III func - tion requires balanced levels of the upstream factors that drive filament nucleation as well as the downstream effectors that control the polymerization rates of these filaments , including the AAA + ATPase VPS4 ( refs . 22 – 26 ) . Here we show that micronuclei are inher - ently unable to restrain ESCRT - III recruitment and activity follow - ing rupture . Unrestrained ESCRT - III is unable to mediate the repair of ruptured micronuclei but instead hyperaccumulates along the micronuclear membrane , driving membrane collapse and promot - ing chromosome fragmentation . Results Nuclear shuttling of CHMP7 controls the recruitment of ESCRT - III . The ESCRT - III machinery forms filaments that drive membrane sealing , which is essential to ensure the integrity of the nuclear envelope 12 – 15 . However , the mechanisms regulating timely recruitment and spatial restriction of ESCRT - III to the site of rup - ture remain poorly understood . To manipulate the function of ESCRT - III at the nuclear envelope , we established RPE1 cell lines that allow the doxycycline ( DOX ) - inducible expression of CHMP7 , the most upstream component driving ESCRT - III processes at the nuclear envelope 12 , 19 , 21 .

Although primary nuclei resealing takes minutes , micronuclear envelope ruptures seem to be irreversible . Instead , micronuclear ruptures result in catastrophic membrane collapse and are associated with chromosome fragmentation and chromothripsis , complex chromosome rearrange - ments thought to be a major driving force in cancer development . Here we use a combination of live microscopy and electron tomography , as well as computer simulations , to uncover the mechanism underlying micronuclear collapse . We show that , due to their small size , micronuclei inherently lack the capacity of primary nuclei to restrict the accumulation of CHMP7 – LEMD2 , a compartmentalization sensor that detects loss of nuclear integrity . This causes unrestrained ESCRT - III accumulation , which drives extensive membrane deformation , DNA damage and chromosome fragmentation . Thus , the nuclear - integrity surveil - lance machinery is a double - edged sword , as its sensitivity ensures rapid repair at primary nuclei while causing unrestrained activity at ruptured micronuclei , with catastrophic consequences for genome stability . NATURE CELL BIoLoGY | www . nature . com / naturecellbiology Articles NATuRE CELL BIoLogy expression was sufficient to induce accumulation of CHMP4B—the main ESCRT - III filament component—into foci that were restricted to the cytoplasm or endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) instead of being associated with the nuclear envelope ( Fig . 1a , left ) . This was consis - tent with the reported localization of CHMP7 to the cytoplasm and ER 19 , 27 and suggested that subcellular localization of CHMP7 could be a key determinant to target CHMP4B foci to the nuclear enve - lope . Interestingly , we found that the CHMP7 carboxy ( C ) - terminal motif previously annotated as a MIM1 motif 22 , 28 matched the con - sensus for type 1a high - affinity nuclear export signals ( NES ; ref . 29 ; Fig . 1b ) . Nuclear export assays 30 using enhanced green fluorescent protein ( eGFP ) fusions confirmed that this sequence could func - tion as a NES ( Fig . 1c and Extended Data Fig . 1a ) and indicated a mechanism for active nuclear exclusion of CHMP7 ( refs . 31 – 33 ) , a small 45 - kDa protein that can passively diffuse through nuclear pore complexes . Brief inducible expression of a CHMP7 allele encoding a mutated NES ( CHMP7 NES * ; Fig . 1b ) was sufficient to drive the formation of persistent CHMP4B foci mostly asso - ciated with the nucleus instead of the cytosol or ER ( Fig . 1a and Extended Data Fig . 1b – f ) . Similar results were obtained when inducing wild - type CHMP7 in the presence of leptomycin B ( LMB ) to inhibit active nuclear export by exportin 1 ( XPO1 ) or following fusion with two nuclear localization sequences ( CHMP7 NLS ; Fig . 1a , right ) . This argued against an effect due to functional perturbation of the putative MIM1 . Together these data show that nuclear entry of CHMP7 is key to its ability to target CHMP4B to the nuclear envelope . The fact that CHMP7 accumulated at the nuclear envelope fol - lowing the abrogation of active export ( Fig . 1a ) suggested that it was actively retained 34 following diffusion into the nucleus . Previous work has pointed towards a role for the inner nuclear membrane protein LEMD2 in the recruitment of CHMP7 to the reforming nuclear envelope during cell division 21 . Similarly , we found that the nuclear retention of CHMP7 NES * and formation of CHMP4B foci in interphase cells was dependent on LEMD2 and its homologue LEMD3 / MAN1 ( Fig . 1d and Extended Data Fig . 1g ) . Prevention of the nuclear export of endogenous CHMP7 in cells that stably expressed LEMD2 – SNAP - tag 35 and CHMP4B – eGFP ( LEMD2 – SNAP , CHMP4B – eGFP cells ) specifically and reversibly induced the formation of CHMP4B foci at sites of LEMD2 enrichment , thereby providing further support for this interplay ( Fig . 1e , Extended Data Fig . 2 and Supplementary Video 1 ) . In contrast to CHMP7 , transient overexpression of either LEMD2 or LEMD3 did not induce CHMP4B foci but instead resulted in the rapid depletion of CHMP4B ( Fig . 1f , Extended Data Fig . 3a , b and Supplementary Video 2 ) . This was dependent on the MAN1 – Src1p C - terminal ( MSC ) domain of LEMD2 and LEMD3 ( Fig . 1g and Extended Data Fig . 3c , d ) , which was previously reported to mediate interaction with CHMP7 ( ref . 21 ) . Accordingly , a reduction in CHMP4B levels beyond stochastic variation was not observed following the overexpression of EMD , LAP2 β or LEMD1—inner nuclear membrane LEM domain proteins that lack an MSC domain ( Fig . 1f ) . Coexpression of LEMD2 with nuclear CHMP7 ( CHMP7 NES * ) suppressed CHMP4B depletion ( Fig . 1h ) and instead caused the formation of stable nuclear envelope foci highly enriched for CHMP4B , CHMP7 NES * and LEMD2 ( Extended Data Fig . 3d ) . Together , our data show that XPO1 - mediated export pre - vents the untimely nuclear localization of CHMP7 and argue that a nuclear influx of CHMP7 is critical to bridge nuclear CHMP4B and LEMD2 , allowing the licensing of CHMP4B polymerization at the nuclear envelope . Unrestrained nuclear CHMP7 drives nuclear envelope deforma - tion and rupture . We exploited the subcellular mislocalization of CHMP7 NES * to monitor the effects of excessive nuclear CHMP7 . Enrichment of the ER lumen marker mCherry – KDEL ( Fig . 2a , top ) and the inner nuclear membrane marker LAP2 β ( Extended Data Fig . 4a ) showed that these foci corresponded to areas where the nuclear envelope underwent architectural deformations . The absence of the nucleoporin NUP58 ( Fig . 2a , bottom ) indicated that CHMP4B foci did not represent aggregates of aberrant nuclear pore complexes 18 , 36 . Considering these membrane deformations 2 , 15 , 37 , we assessed the effects of overexpression of CHMP7 alleles on nuclear envelope integrity . To this end , we monitored an mRuby3 – NES fusion that requires nucleocytoplasmic compartmentalization for its exclusion from the nucleus . Whereas overexpression of LEMD2 or CHMP7 did not compromise nuclear integrity , cells expressing CHMP7 NES * or CHMP7 NLS underwent decompartmentalization within hours ( Fig . 2b and Extended Data Fig . 4b – f ) , in a fashion dependent on the CHMP7 membrane - binding amino ( N ) termi - nus 19 ( Fig . 2b and Extended Data Fig . 4g ) as well as the presence of LEMD2 and LEMD3 ( Extended Data Fig . 4h ) . This was not due to defective mitotic nuclear envelope reformation , as it was read - ily observed in cells that did not traverse mitosis ( Supplementary Video 3 ) . Previous work has shown that deregulation of ESCRT - III compo - nents can cause excessive accumulations that distort the membrane morphology in a variety of cellular contexts 20 , 26 , 38 . We performed correlative light and electron microscopy ( CLEM ) to assess mem - brane deformation following overexpression of CHMP7 alleles in more detail . Consistent with their localization , CHMP7 overex - pression resulted in remodelling of the ER with little effect on the nuclear envelope ( Fig . 2c , left ) , CHMP7 NES * affected both the ER and the nuclear envelope ( Fig . 2c , middle ; and Extended Data Fig . 4b ) , while CHMP7 NLS selectively distorted the inner nuclear membrane ( Fig . 2c , right ) . Analyses of these samples in greater detail using electron tomography revealed extensive membrane distortions composed of complex three - dimensional ( 3D ) trabecular networks with tubular features that were very similar for all alleles regard - less of subcellular localization ( Fig . 2c , bottom ; and Extended Data Fig . 4i ) . Furthermore , immunogold electron microscopy showed that CHMP4B was tightly associated with deformed nuclear mem - branes ( Fig . 2d , Extended Data Fig . 4j and Supplementary Video 4 ) . Together , we conclude that an excessive nuclear influx of CHMP7 is sufficient to drive the formation of persistent ESCRT - III foci that deform the nuclear envelope to the point of irreversible loss of compartmentalization 12 – 15 . Ruptured micronuclei undergo ESCRT - III - driven collapse . Although defects of inner membrane components have been shown to predispose micronuclei to rupture 1 , 2 , 6 , the engagement of mem - brane repair pathways following rupture has remained largely unstudied . In line with previous observations 39 , 40 , we observed that a significant fraction of micronuclei was enriched for endogenous CHMP4B and downstream ESCRT - III components in a range of cell lines ( Extended Data Fig . 5a , b ) . To dissect the chain of events at micronuclei following spontaneous rupture , we used live - cell imaging to monitor the CHMP4B dynamics at micronuclei that were induced with AZ3146 , an inhibitor of the spindle assembly checkpoint regulator monopolar spindle 1 ( MPS1 ) . Intact micronu - clei showed correct localization of the compartmentalization mark - ers mCherry – NLS and mRuby3 – NES , as well as CHMP4B – eGFP ( Extended Data Fig . 5c , d and Supplementary Videos 5 , 6 ) . Following rupture at sites of nuclear envelope weakness ( Fig . 3a , arrowhead ) , CHMP4B was rapidly recruited to discrete foci in proximity to the rupture site ( Fig . 3a , Extended Data Fig . 5c , d and Supplementary Videos 5 , 6 ) in a membrane - binding - dependent fashion ( Fig . 3b and Extended Data Fig . 5e , f ) . However , instead of the characteristic tran - sient recruitment associated with successful repair 12 , 14 , CHMP4B progressively spread along the micronuclear envelope followed by persistent accumulation in multiple coalescing foci without any detectable envelope repair in HeLaK cells ( Fig . 3a , c , Extended NATURE CELL BIoLoGY | www . nature . com / naturecellbiology Articles NATuRE CELL BIoLogy 0 . 5 1 . 0 – LEMD2 + CHMP7 NES * 0 F r a c t i on o f CH M P 4 B + c e ll s NS NS * * e C e ll s w i t h nu c l ea r CH M P 4 B f o c i ( % ) * * NS d h 0 4 8 12 16 20 siCon siLEMD2 siLEMD2 + 3 0 8 4 12 16 Time after DOX addition ( h ) N u m be r o f nu c l ea r CH M P 4 B f o c i * * * * * 453 WT 1 223 1 * * * * * * 453 NES * 453NES * ∆ N NLS VPS25 - like SNF7 NES ( MIM1 ) b mmCHMP7 scCHM7 dicdiCHMP7 NES ( type 1a ) MIM1 hsCHMP7 dmCHMP7 α 5 – LEMD2 WT Δ N Δ C * * * * * * NS CH M P 4 B i n t en s i t y ( a . u . ) f 0 1 2 3 4 0 1 2 3 4 – Emerin LAP2 β LEMD2 LEMD1 LEMD3 CH M P 4 B i n t en s i t y ( a . u . ) * * * * * * * NS NS NS g CH M P 4 B – m N G WT NES * NLS CH M P 7 O v e r l a y WT + L M B a LEMD2 – – c R EV ( 1 . 4 ) – e G F P NES NES * NES + L M B O v e r l a y + DN A 0 20 40 60 siCon siCHMP7 siCon + LMB Fig . 1 | CHMP7 localization and its interplay with LEMD2 controls nuclear ESCRT - III dynamics . a , Targeting of CHMP4B – mNeonGreen ( mNG ) foci depends on the subcellular localization of CHMP7 .

In RPE1 cells , a small fraction of micronuclei rapidly recompartmentalized following rup - ture , an indication of successful repair ( Fig . 3c ) . In such cases , we could observe transient CHMP4B recruitment restricted to a sin - gle focus ( compare Fig . 3d with Fig . 3e ) , resembling the dynamics observed at primary nuclei 12 , 14 , 15 . Along with the appearance of persistent CHMP4 foci , we noticed that the morphology of nuclear envelopes rapidly changed from being smoothly round to progressively more convoluted and con - densed , most notably at the sites of CHMP4B accumulation ( Fig . 3f , Extended Data Fig . 5g and Supplementary Video 7 ) . This pheno - type was reverted by the depletion of CHMP4B or CHMP7 ( Fig . 3f ) , indicating that the morphological changes are dependent on the accumulation of ESCRT - III . Experiments using CLEM on ruptured micronuclei revealed complex trabecular membrane networks at the sites of CHMP4B accumulations ( Fig . 3g , Extended Data Fig . 6a – c and Supplementary Video 8 ) . These complex 3D mem - brane networks required recruitment of CHMP4B and CHMP7 to the ruptured micronuclei ( Fig . 3g , right ; and Extended Data Fig . 6d ) , and showed striking architectural similarities to the phenotypes observed at primary nuclei following the overexpres - sion of nuclear CHMP7 ( Extended Data Fig . 7 ) . In fact , micronuclei could accumulate CHMP4B to levels comparable to those that drive the irreversible rupture of primary nuclei ( Extended Data Fig . 8a ) . This raises the possibility that excessive accumulation of ESCRT - III not only fails to mediate membrane repair but induces membrane distortions to an extent that could yield further ruptures ( Fig . 2 and Extended Data Fig . 4 ) . These data show that ESCRT - III is recruited to the envelope of micronuclei following rupture but is unable to repair the membrane . On the contrary , it accumulates over time and drives micronuclear membrane collapse . Ruptured micronuclei lack the ability to restrain ESCRT - III activity . We next investigated what defects underlie the persistent accumulation of ESCRT - III in the absence of functional repair . Timely recruitment of the VPS4 ATPase ( Extended Data Fig . 8b ) 23 and exacerbation of CHMP4B accumulation following the deple - tion of CHMP2A , a subunit essential for VPS4 recruitment ( Fig . 4a and Extended Data Fig . 8c , d ) 41 , suggested that ESCRT - III filament turnover remained functional at ruptured micronuclei . In contrast , rupture was associated with a dramatic accumulation of LEMD2 rapidly spreading from the site of rupture to cover the entire micronuclear envelope ( Fig . 4b , c and Supplementary Video 9 ) . This phenotype required the presence of CHMP7 ( Fig . 4c , d and Supplementary Video 10 ) . Conversely , the deletion of the LEMD2 C - terminal MSC domain ( Δ C ) that mediates recruitment of CHMP7 ( ref . 21 ) prevented CHMP4B accumulation at micronu - clei ( Fig . 4e and Extended Data Fig . 8e ) . This pointed to a defect in the control of nucleation of CHMP4B polymers as the source of the defects observed at micronuclei . The accumulation of LEMD2 , CHMP7 and CHMP4B ( Fig . 4f and Extended Data Fig . 8f ) at rup - tured micronuclei was reminiscent of their interplay at primary nuclei following ectopic expression of CHMP7 NES * ( Extended Data Fig . 4g ) . Considering the delicate balance governing ESCRT - III function 23 , we wondered whether excessive CHMP7 recruitment would preclude its function . To test this , we briefly induced over - expression of wild - type CHMP7 and monitored nuclear envelope reformation during mitotic exit , a process that critically relies on ESCRT - III function 12 , 13 . These CHMP7 - overexpressing cells exited mitosis with persistent accumulation of LEMD2 in foci and were unable to fully restore nucleocytoplasmic compartmentalization ( Fig . 4g and Supplementary Video 11 ) . This supported a simple model where the amount of CHMP7 critically determines the com - petence of ESCRT - III function and suggested that micronuclei are unable to restrict formation of the CHMP7 – LEMD2 complex to levels compatible with repair . The balance between CHMP7 and LEMD2 determines the fate of ruptured micronuclei . To evaluate this model , we set up com - puter simulations of nuclear envelope rupture at primary nuclei and micronuclei . We focused on capturing three key phenomena in our set - up ( see Methods ) : the diffusion of CHMP7 molecules , the binding of CHMP7 – LEMD2 complexes and the decay of such complexes . Using the concentration of the CHMP7 – LEMD2 nucle - ation complex in the inner nuclear membrane following rupture as the readout , we tested the parametric ranges inferred from the lit - erature ( Extended Data Fig . 9 and Methods ) . We decided to focus on membrane - bound diffusion of CHMP7 molecules , in line with previous work highlighting the importance of CHMP7 membrane association for its function 19 . This also recapitulated our micros - copy data better than the use of cytosolic diffusion parameters for CHMP7 ( Supplementary Videos 7 , 9 , 10 , Fig . 5a and Extended Data Fig . 9a ) . Following rupture , diffusion of membrane - bound CHMP7 through the site of rupture in the small ( 4 µ m 3 ) micronucleus rapidly overloaded the existing pool of LEMD2 along the entire micronu - clear envelope ( Fig . 5a , top ) . The accumulation of CHMP7 – LEMD2 remained restricted to the site of rupture at the much larger pri - mary nucleus ( 400 µ m 3 ; Fig . 5a , bottom ) under the same condi - tions . Furthermore , we mimicked an influx of new LEMD2 from the ER by generating additional LEMD2 molecules following high occupancy of the available binding sites ( Extended Data Fig . 9b ) . This made our simulations more consistent with our observations in cells and resulted in the concentrations of CHMP7 – LEMD2 complexes at the micronuclei to exceed those at primary nuclei ( Figs . 4b , 5a and Supplementary Video 10 ) . Interestingly , we found that the spreading of the CHMP7 – LEMD2 complexes was very sen - sitive to the ratio of available components . A reduction in CHMP7 or increase in LEMD2 molecules progressively restricted complex formation to the site of rupture in micronuclei , thereby resembling the events at primary nuclei more closely ( Extended Data Fig . 9c , d ) . The effect of CHMP7 influx may be further aggravated in cells , as we observed lower levels of XPO1 in ruptured micronuclei com - pared with primary nuclei ( Fig . 5b and Extended Data Fig . 9e ) . Our simulations predicted that larger micronuclei would become progressively more refractory to the spread of the CHMP7 – LEMD2 complex ( Fig . 5c ) . To test this , we monitored CHMP4B spreading along the membrane in micronuclei of different sizes in living cells . These experiments showed a correlation between the micronucleus size and spreading of ESCRT - III along its membrane ( Fig . 5d , e ) . Furthermore , if CHMP7 overload prevented the repair of ruptured micronuclei , our simulations postulated that a reduction of the cellu - lar levels of CHMP7 could rescue this repair defect ( Extended Data Fig . 9c ) . Partial depletion of CHMP7 in RPE1 cells indeed resulted in a significantly higher repair frequency of ruptured micronuclei ( Fig . 5f ) . The fact that complete depletion of CHMP7 prevented repair ( Fig . 5f ) underscores the essential function of ESCRT - III in nuclear envelope repair . Together , our microscopy data and simula - tions argue that defects observed at micronuclei can be explained by an inherent inability to restrict CHMP7 – LEMD2 complexes that licences unrestrained CHMP4B polymerization . This converts the activity of ESCRT - III machinery from rapid envelope sealing to persistent membrane distortion . Unrestrained CHMP7 accumulation drives DNA damage and chromosome fragmentation . Considering the dramatic morpho - logical changes induced by ESCRT - III at primary nuclei and rup - tured micronuclei , we explored the relationship between ESCRT - III accumulation and the stability of the underlying genome . We exploited ectopic nuclear accumulation of CHMP7 NES * to primary nuclei as a tractable model . CHMP7 NES * - induced nuclear ESCRT - III foci were associated with rosettes of γ H2Ax and 53BP1 , and were enriched for the single - stranded DNA - binding replication protein NATURE CELL BIoLoGY | www . nature . com / naturecellbiology Articles NATuRE CELL BIoLogy A2 ( RPA2 ; ref . 42 ; Fig . 6a , b and Extended Data Fig . 10a ) . The fact that RPA2 enrichment was restricted to CHMP4B foci at the nuclear surface ( Manders’ colocalization coefficient RPA2 – CHMP4B , 0 . 79 ± 0 . 23 s . d . , mean ± s . d . ) argued against an influx of cytoplas - mic stressors underlying this phenotype . Furthermore , co - staining with PCNA argued against these foci being a direct consequence of ongoing DNA replication stress ( Fig . 6c , d ) . Because of the dra - matic membrane distortions combined with an accumulation of chromatin - associated proteins such as LEMD2 ( ref . 43 ) , we investi - gated whether RPA2 foci corresponded to areas subject to DNA tor - sional stress 44 . Strikingly , we found that topoisomerase IIb ( TOP2B ) , the enzyme that relieves torsional stress in chromatin topologi - cal domains by transiently generating chromosomal breaks 45 , was highly enriched at these foci ( Fig . 6e and Extended Data Fig . 10b ) . As TOP2B has previously been linked to chromosome rearrangements 45 , we tested the consequences of this torsional stress on chromosome integrity by analysing the metaphase spreads fol - lowing the induction of CHMP7 alleles . Whereas overexpression of wild - type CHMP7 induced a low level of DNA breaks , induction of CHMP7 NES * dramatically increased the frequency of chromosomal breaks and fragmentation ( Fig . 6f , g ) . Unrestrained ESCRT - III drives the accumulation of DNA dam - age in ruptured micronuclei . Reasoning that this same phe - nomenon could mediate chromosome fragmentation in ruptured micronuclei , we assessed RPA2 accumulation at micronuclei and found that it indeed colocalized with CHMP4B foci ( Fig . 7a , b ; Manders’ colocalization coefficient RPA / CHMP4B , 0 . 94 ± 0 . 05 , mean ± s . d . ) .

NATURE CELL BIoLoGY | www . nature . com / naturecellbiology Articles NATuRE CELL BIoLogy effects on cell - cycle phase distribution ( Extended Data Fig . 10c ) . These data suggest that a loss of compartmentalization per se or DNA replication were not the cause of RPA2 accumulation . RPA2 accumulation could be restored by the introduction of a short inter - fering RNA ( siRNA ) - resistant LEMD2 allele but not of a LEMD2 Δ C allele unable to recruit CHMP7 ( Fig . 7g and Fig . 4e ) . These data show that unrestrained accumulation of ESCRT - III at primary nuclei and micronuclei has catastrophic effects on the underlying DNA , inducing torsional stress , the formation of single - stranded DNA and chromosome fragmentation . Discussion Recent work has highlighted that defects in inner membrane com - ponents predispose micronuclei to rupture 1 , 2 , 6 , but the equally important question of why ruptured micronuclei undergo collapse rather than repair has remained unaddressed . Previous work has shown that components of the ESCRT - III machinery accumulate at a fraction of micronuclei that were proposed to be ruptured 39 , 40 . However , the reliance of these studies on fixed - cell imaging pre - cluded the identification of bona fide interphase micronuclei rupture events 1 and prevented assessment of the temporal and functional relationship between ESCRT - III recruitment and micro - nuclear rupture and fate . Furthermore , confounding effects from defective ESCRT - III function during post - mitotic nuclear envelope reformation were not considered 12 , 39 . Here we have combined live - cell and electron microscopy to study the molecular events following micronuclear rupture and identify the ESCRT - III nuclear envelope repair machinery as the underlying driver of micronuclear collapse . We show that micronuclei lack the capacity to restrict CHMP7 – LEMD2 complexes to the site of rup - ture , resulting in unrestrained activation of ESCRT - III across the surface of their inner membrane ( Fig . 7h ) . Rather than repairing the ruptured micronuclei , hyperaccumulation of ESCRT - III drives dramatic membrane distortion and causes DNA torsional stress , formation of single - stranded DNA and chromosome damage . This ultimately results in the fragmentation of chromosomes , probably in concert with the recruitment of exonucleases such as TREX1 ( Extended Data Fig . 10d – f ) 46 , 47 as well as stress ensuing from defec - tive DNA replication and premature chromosome condensation frequently associated with ruptured micronuclei 2 , 6 .

NATURE CELL BIoLoGY | www . nature . com / naturecellbiology Articles NATuRE CELL BIoLogy under normal conditions CHMP7 is actively excluded from the nucleus by XPO1 - dependent export , with perturbation of this sys - tem resulting in its retention at the inner nuclear membrane via association with LEMD2 and LEMD3 . Despite their coexistence with CHMP4B in the nucleus , neither LEMD2 nor LEMD3 are able to trigger the formation of ESCRT - III filaments in the absence of nuclear CHMP7 . On the contrary , their overexpression induces the depletion of nucleoplasmic CHMP4B . This mechanism may prevent spurious activation of nuclear ESCRT - III and illustrates the critical role for the nuclear influx and retention of CHMP7 to generate a stable platform that licences nucleation of ESCRT - III filaments at the sites of rupture . This CHMP7 – LEMD2 compart - mentalization sensor provides an elegant mechanism that couples sensing of nuclear membrane ruptures to their repair .

Recent work in metazoan systems indicates that this membrane - rupture sensor is part of a larger response mechanism that involves rapid recruitment of the barrier - to - autointegration factor ( BAF ) to the exposed chromatin . The ability of BAF to bridge chromatin and transmembrane LEM domain proteins provides an attractive mechanism for recruiting membranes to the site of rup - ture 48 , 49 and directly couples this pathway to ESCRT - III - mediated membrane sealing 1 , 49 , 50 . The recent implication of lipin - mediated de novo glycerophospholipid synthesis 51 and the extensive parallels to mitotic nuclear envelope reformation indicate that further layers of regulation remain to be explored 48 , 52 , 53 . Although it is clear that various evolutionary adaptations exist 48 , 49 , it is interesting to note that budding yeast was recently shown to exploit a similar system for monitoring nuclear transport that may be comparably exploited to ensure nuclear integrity 20 . In conclusion , we propose that whereas protein - distribution defects predispose micronuclei to rupture , uncontrolled ESCRT - III activity following rupture precludes their repair and instead drives micronuclear catastrophe and ensuing DNA damage . As such , our work highlights the ESCRT - III machinery as a double - edged sword and suggests that it represents a conditional non - genetic driver of genome instability with implications for cancer development . online content Any methods , additional references , Nature Research report - ing summaries , source data , extended data , supplementary infor - mation , acknowledgements , peer review information ; details of author contributions and competing interests ; and statements of data and code availability are available at https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41556 - 020 - 0537 - 5 .

The cell lines were cultured as recommended by the American Type Culture Collection guidelines . For live - cell imaging , the cells were seeded into glass - bottom imaging dishes ( Lab - Tek , Nunc ; MatTek , MatTek Corporation ) . For the immunofluorescence studies , the cells were cultured on high - precision coverglass ( Marienfeld ) . For confocal microscopy , the cells were fixed with 4 % electron microscopy - grade formaldehyde ( Polysciences ) for 5 min at 37 °C . The cells were then permeabilized by treatment with 0 . 16 % Triton X - 100 for 2 min . Primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in PBS containing 0 . 05 % saponin and incubated for 1 – 2 h . After antibody staining , the samples were mounted on microscope slides ( Menzel – Glaser ) with Mowiol for standard confocal imaging or SlowFade gold antifade reagent ( Life Technologies ) for Airyscan microscopy . The HTERT RPE1 and HeLaK cell lines stably expressing inducible CHMP7 or LEMD2 alleles were treated with 500 ng ml − 1 DOX ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . XPO1 inhibition was carried out by incubating the cells with 2 . 5 ng ml − 1 LMB ( InvivoGen ) for up to 3 h . The loss of XPO1 activity was monitored by the nuclear localization of mRuby3 – NES . Micronucleation was induced by AZ3146 ( Selleckchem ) at a concentration of 2 – 4 µ M . The RPE1 cell lines were depleted of p53 before AZ3146 treatment . Stable cell lines . A stable HeLa ‘Kyoto’ cell line expressing CHMP4B – eGFP was obtained from A . Hyman 54 . All of the other stable cell lines were lentivirus - generated pools . The weak PGK promoter was used for transgene expression to achieve low levels of expression . The CMV or EF1 α promoters were used for higher levels of expression . Third - generation lentivirus was generated using procedures and plasmids that have been previously described 55 . Briefly , eGFP / mNG / mCherry / mRuby3 / SNAP / V5 / FLAG fusions of transgenes were generated as Gateway ENTRY plasmids using standard molecular biology techniques , with all CHMP4B - fusions containing the LAPtag module 54 . Lentiviral transfer vectors were generated from these vectors by recombination into lentiviral destination vectors ( Addgene plasmids 19067 , 19068 and 41393 ) and vectors derived from pCDH - EF1 α - MCS - IRES - PURO ( SystemBiosciences , Inc . ) using Gateway LR reactions . VSV - G - pseudotyped lentiviral particles were packaged using a third - generation packaging system ( Addgene plasmids 12251 , 12253 and 12259 ) 56 . HeLaK or RPE1 cells were then transduced with a low virus titre ( multiplicity of infection ≤ 1 ) and stable expressing populations were generated by antibiotic selection . Detailed cloning procedures are available on request . The stable cell lines used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table 2 . Transient plasmid transfections . For the transient expression of various alleles , cells were cultured on Precision coverglass in 24 - well plates or glass - bottom imaging dishes and transfected with 0 . 5 μ g of the DNA construct complexed with Fugene6 ( Promega ) following the manufacturer’s instructions . The cells were then fixed or imaged by live - cell imaging 12 – 24 h after transfection . The plasmids used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table 3 and detailed cloning procedures are available on request . siRNA transfections . All siRNAs were purchased from Ambion and contained the Silencer Select modification . Cells at 50 % confluency were transfected with the Lipofectamine RNAiMAX transfection reagent ( Life Technologies ) following the manufacturer’s instructions . The cells were transfected with 50 nM siRNA targeting CHMP2A ( AAGAUGAAGAGGAGAGUGAtt ) or p53 ( GUAAUCUAC UGGGACGGAAtt ) for 48 h . CHMP4B ( CAUCGAGUUCCAGCGGGAGtt ) , CHMP7 ( AGGUCUCUCCAGUCAAUGAtt ) , LEMD2 ( AGCUGGUAAUUUUG AGUGUtt ) and LEMD3 ( GGGACUGACUUACCUAGGAtt ) were silenced by 2 × serial transfections with the siRNA at a concentration of 50 nM for a total of 72 h . Lowercase dinucleotides represent non - pairing flanking sequences . Non - targeting control Silencer Select siRNA ( pre - designed , cat . no . 4390844 ) was used as a control .

Secondary antibodies included anti - mouse - , anti - rabbit - and anti - goat - Alexa488 ( Jackson ) , Alexa568 ( Molecular Probes ) and Alexa647 ( Jackson ) . Mouse monoclonal anti - HA ( BioLegend , clone 16B12 , 901501 ; 1 : 300 ) and goat anti - mouse - Alexa594 - FluoroNanogold ( Molecular Probes , A - 24921 ; 1 : 200 ) were used in immunogold electron microscopy . Confocal microscopy . Fixed samples were imaged using a Zeiss LSM 710 or 780 confocal microscope ( Carl Zeiss MicroImaging GmbH ) equipped with an Ar - Laser Multiline ( 458 / 488 / 514 nm ) , a DPSS - 561 10 ( 561 nm ) , a laser diode 405 – 430 CW ( 405 nm ) and a HeNe laser ( 633 nm ) . The objective used was a Zeiss plan - apochromat × 63 / 1 . 40 oil DIC M27 . Image processing was performed with basic ZEN 2009 software ( Carl Zeiss MicroImaging GmbH ) and ImageJ software 57 ( National Institutes of Health ) . Confocal Airyscan microscopy . Fixed cells were imaged using a Zeiss LSM 880 Airyscan microscope ( Carl Zeiss MicroImaging GmbH ) equipped with an Ar - Laser Multiline ( 458 / 488 / 514 nm ) , a DPSS - 561 ( 561 nm ) , a laser diode - 405 CW ( 405 nm ) and a HeNe laser ( 633 nm ) . The objective used was a Zeiss plan - apochromat × 63 / 1 . 4 oil DICII . The images were acquired with the Airyscan detector with a voxel size of 0 . 035 × 0 . 035 × 0 . 144 µ m for high - resolution imaging and super - resolution processing resulting in a final resolution of 120 × 120 × 350 nm . Image acquisition , processing and analysis were performed with the ZEN 2 . 3 SP1 basic software ( Carl Zeiss ) or ZEN 2 . 3 Blue ( Carl Zeiss ) . Three - dimensional visualization of z - stacks was done using Imaris 7 . 7 . 2 ( Bitplane AG ) . Manders’ and Pearson’s colocalization measurements were done in ZEN 2 . 3 Blue with a Costes automatic thresholding . Bitplane Imaris software was used to generate surface renderings of 3D structured illumination microscopy images . Live microscopy . Cells seeded and cultured on glass - bottom chambers were imaged using a DeltaVision widefield microscope ( Applied Precision ) equipped with an Elite TruLight Illumination system , a CoolSNAP HQ2 camera and × 40 or × 60 plan - apochromat ( 1 . 42 numerical aperture ) lenses . Alternatively , the glass - bottom chambers were imaged on a Dragonfly 505 spinning disk confocal microscope ( Andor Technology ) equipped with a Borealis perfect illumination delivery system , an iXon Life 888 EMCCD camera and a CFI apochromat × 60 TIRF ( 1 . 49 numerical aperture ) lens . For temperature control during live observation , the microscope stage was kept at 37 °C by a temperature - controlled incubation chamber . For Deltavision imaging , time - lapse images were deconvolved using the softWoRx software ( Applied Precision , GE Healthcare ) and all imaging was processed using ImageJ for presentation and quantifications . The cells were imaged in DMEM gfp - 2 anti - bleaching live - cell imaging medium ( Evrogen ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum and 25 mM HEPES . Environmental control was provided by a heated stage and an objective heater ( 20 – 20 Technologies ) . SNAP - Cell 647 - SiR ( SiR - SNAP , 0 . 5 µ M ; New England Biolabs ) was used to detect the SNAP - tagged alleles . SiR – Hoechst ( 50 – 100 nM ; SpiroChrome ) was used to monitor the nuclei and micronuclei . Images were deconvolved using the softWoRx software and processed in ImageJ / FIJI 57 or Imaris . Nuclear ruptures were identified by compromised nucleocytoplasmic compartmentalization , as visualized by the equalization of the mRuby3 – NES intensity between the ( micro - ) nucleus and cytoplasm . For quantification of nucleocytoplasmic compartmentalization in living cells ( Figs . 2b , 4g and Extended Data Figs . 2b , 4c , e , h ) , regions of interest ( ROIs ) were drawn in the nucleus and cytoplasm , followed by extraction of the mean fluorescence intensity , background fluorescence subtraction and calculation of the ( N ) / ( C ) mean intensity ratios . For cells with intact nuclei , the ( N ) / ( C ) ratio approximates 0 . 5 , whereas this ratio approximates one for cells with ruptured nuclei . High - content microscopy . For the quantification of LEMD2 – CHMP7 – CHMP4B - positive micronuclei and TREX1 - enrichment experiments , an Olympus ScanR system ( illumination system with an UPLSAPO × 40 objective ) was used for imaging of a large number of cells in fixed samples and stained for the proteins of interest . CLEM . The cells for CLEM experiments were grown on photo - etched coverslips ( Electron Microscopy Sciences ) . Fixation was done with 4 % formaldehyde and 0 . 1 % glutaraldehyde in 0 . 1 M PHEM ( 60 mM PIPES , 25 mM HEPES , 2 mM MgCl 2 and 10 mM EGTA , pH 6 . 9 ) for 1 h . The coverslips were washed with 0 . 1 M PHEM buffer and mounted with Mowiol containing 1 µ g ml − 1 Hoechst 33342 . The cells were examined using a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope ( Carl Zeiss MicroImaging GmbH ) equipped with a laser diode 405 – 430 CW ( 405 nm ) , an Ar - Laser Multiline ( 458 , 488 and 514 nm ) , a DPSS - 561 10 ( 561 nm ) and a HeNe laser ( 633 nm ) . The cells of interest were identified by fluorescence microscopy and a z - stack covering the whole - cell volume was acquired , and their positioning on the photo - etched coverslips was determined by taking a DIC image at low magnification . The coverslips were removed from the object glass , washed with 0 . 1 M PHEM buffer and fixed in 2 % glutaraldehyde in 0 . 1 M PHEM overnight . The cells were post fixed in osmium tetroxide and potassium ferricyanide , stained with tannic acid and uranyl acetate , and then dehydrated stepwise to 100 % ethanol , followed by flat - embedding in Epon . Serial sections ( 80 – 200 nm ) were cut on an Ultracut UCT ultramicrotome NATURE CELL BIoLoGY | www . nature . com / naturecellbiology Articles NATuRE CELL BIoLogy ( Leica ) and collected on formvar - coated slot grids . Thin sections were observed at 80 kV using a JEOL - JEM 1230 electron microscope and images were recorded using the iTEM software with a Morada camera ( Olympus ) . Sections with a thickness of 200 nm were observed at 200 kV in a Thermo Scientific Talos F200C microscope and recorded with a Ceta 16M camera . Consecutive sections were used to align electron micrographs with fluorescent images in the x , y and z dimensions . For tomograms , image series of 200 - nm - thick sections were taken between − 60° and 60° tilt angles with 2° increments . Single - axes tilt series were recorded using a Ceta 16M camera . The tomograms were computed using weighted back projection using the IMOD package . Display , segmentation and animation of tomograms were also performed using IMOD software version 4 . 9 ( ref . 58 ) . ImageJ / FIJI and ‘mean’ filters were used for the figure presentations . Immunogold electron microscopy . RPE1 cells stably expressing mRuby3 – NES , CHMP4B – mNG – 3HA and DOX - inducible CHMP7 NES * – FLAG were cultured on coverslips and treated with 500 ng ml − 1 DOX for 16 h . The cells were then fixed with 4 % formaldehyde and 0 . 01 % glutaraldehyde in 0 . 1 M PHEM for 25 min . The coverslips were next washed with 1 × PBS , followed by permeabilization ( 0 . 025 % saponin in 1 × PBS ) , blocked with blocking buffer ( 0 . 5 % BSA , 0 . 025 % saponin and 1 × PBS ) and incubated for 90 min with anti - HA antibody and gold - conjugated secondary antibody . The antibodies were diluted in blocking buffer . The cells were then fixed again with 1 % glutaraldehyde in 0 . 1 M PHEM before silver enhancement according to the manufacturer’s protocol ( HQ silver enhancement kit , Nanoprobes ) and gold toning . The cells were post fixed in osmium tetroxide and potassium ferricyanide , stained with tannic acid and uranyl acetate , and then dehydrated stepwise to 100 % ethanol , followed by flat - embedding in Epon . Serial sections ( 100 nm ) were cut on an Ultracut UCT ultramicrotome ( Leica ) and collected on formvar - coated slot grids . Thin sections were observed at 80 kV with a JEOL - JEM 1230 electron microscope and images were recorded using the iTEM software with a Morada camera ( Olympus ) . The tomograms were acquired and computed as described earlier . ImageJ / FIJI and the ‘unsharp mask’ ( for transmission electron microscopy images ) or mean ( for electron tomography images ) filters were used for the figure presentations . Immunoblotting . Cells were lysed in 2 × sample buffer ( 100 mM Tris – HCl pH 6 . 8 , 4 % SDS , 20 % glycerol , 200 mM dithiothreitol and bromophenol blue ) . The whole - cell lysate was subjected to SDS – PAGE on a 4 – 20 % gradient gel . The proteins were transferred to an Immobilon - P membrane ( Millipore ) . Immunodetection was performed using fluorescently labelled secondary antibodies and Odyssey or ChemiDoc developer . Real - time quantitative PCR analysis . Total RNA was extracted using an RNeasy mini kit ( Qiagen , 74106 ) . Reverse transcription was performed on 500 ng of DNAse I - treated total RNA using a high - capacity complementary DNA reverse transcription kit following the manufacturer’s recommendations ( Applied Biosystems , 4368814 ) . Real - time quantitative PCR was performed on 2 μ l of diluted cDNA ( 1 / 25 ) using a CFX - 96 ( Bio - Rad ) thermocycler and the 2 × SsoAdvanced universal SYBR Green supermix ( Bio - Rad ) . The following primers were used at a final concentration of 250 nM ( all Invitrogen ) : CHMP7 – FLAG , GTCACAGTCCTCGAGCAGAA ( Forward ) and TACGTCGTTAACAGGGCTCA ( Reverse ) ; PPIA , ATGCTGGACCCAACACAAAT ( Forward ) and TCTTTCACT TTGCCAAACACC ( Reverse ) . All measurements were normalized to the expression of PPIA . The results were analysed using the 2 (cid:31) ΔΔ C T I method and are presented as the mean of three independent experiments . Metaphase spreads . RPE1 cells stably expressing mRuby3 – NES and DOX - inducible CHMP7 – FLAG or CHMP7 NES * – FLAG were treated with 500 ng ml − 1 DOX for 4 h and then washed . Mitotic cells were enriched by incubation with 12 . 5 ng ml − 1 colcemid ( KaryoMAX , Gibco ) for 20 h . The cells were then harvested , hypotonically swollen in 75 mM KCl for 45 min , fixed by adding ice - cold fixative solution ( 3 : 1 methanol : acetic acid ) and dropped onto slides ( Superfrost microscopy slides , Thermo Scientific ) . After drying , the slides were immersed in SSC buffer ( 300 m M NaCl and 30 mM trisodium citrate , pH 7 ) at 60 °C for 4 h and the chromosomes were then G - banded using Wright stain ( Merck ) . The subsequent cytogenetic analysis and karyotypic description followed the recommendations of the International System for Human Cytogenetic Nomenclature ( ISCN 2106 ) . Flow cytometry . Cells were fixed in 70 % ethanol at − 20 °C and the DNA was stained with Hoechst 33342 ( 1 . 5 μ g ml − 1 ) . Flow cytometry analysis was performed using an LSRII flow cytometer ( BD Biosciences ) and the FACS Diva software ( BD Biosciences ; Supplementary Fig . 1 ) , and data were analysed using the FlowJo software . The data were then plotted using GraphPad Prism . Computer simulations . The geometry of our computer simulations consists of a spherical cell and a smaller concentric nucleus populated by two types of particles , CHMP7 and LEMD2 . LEMD2 is located on the inner nuclear membrane and CHMP7 is located either in the cytoplasm or on the outer nuclear membrane / endoplasmic reticulum . During the simulations , the number of LEMD2 sites bound to CHMP7 are monitored following simulated rupture of the nuclear envelope . The CHMP7 – LEMD2 interaction is a reversible reaction with a forward rate , F L , and a backwards rate , D L . The values and sources for all relevant variables are listed in Supplementary Table 1 ( refs . 59 – 69 ) . Two settings for CHMP7 are considered . In the first case , CHMP7 is treated as soluble and is free to diffuse in the cytoplasm in 3D . In the second case , CHMP7 is tethered to the outer nuclear membrane / endoplasmic reticulum and diffusion is restricted to two dimensions ( 2D ) on the surface . We find the second case , where CHMP7 particles diffuse on the membrane , better captures our microscopy data . Furthermore , as the surface area of the ER is orders of magnitude larger than the nuclear membrane , we assume the CHMP7 particles on the outer nuclear membrane are in contact with a reservoir : when a particle moves from the outer to the inner nuclear membrane , a new particle is placed randomly on the outer nuclear membrane to keep the concentration constant . Three phenomena were modelled to capture the key behaviours of the system : diffusion , reactions and decay . In free ( 3D ) diffusion , the particles are expected to perform random walks , as given by h δ x 2 i ¼ 6 D δ t ð 1 Þ where D is the diffusion constant of the particle . In our model , we implement this by allowing each particle to jump a distance , j , in 3D space at each time step with a probability , P walk I , given by 70 P walk ¼ 1 � exp ð� Δ t = τ Þ ð 2 Þ where τ is the waiting time of the particle and Δ t I is the time step of the simulation . The value of τ is chosen to ensure consistency between our simulation and the expected physical results : τ ¼ j 2 6 D ð 3 Þ Here , if the jump would take the particle through a membrane barrier , the particle is bounced off the membrane instead , unless it would pass through the nuclear envelope rupture . Once a CHMP7 particle is bound to a LEMD2 particle it is immobilized until the complex decays . In the case of membrane - bound CHMP7 ( 2D ) , diffusion is modelled on a spherical surface . The particles were initialized on the sphere by picking their location uniformly for the polar angle θ 2 ½ 0 ; 2 π Þ I and in cos ϕ 2 ½� 1 ; 1 Þ I for the azimuthal angle , given that picking the positions uniformly in ϕ would result in an overrepresentation of particles at the poles 71 . To ensure that a particle moves in a uniform manner , we first align the north pole ( z axis ) of our coordinate system to the position of the particle , and then move the particle over a distance j away from the north pole in the θ direction . The ϕ angle is chosen randomly , 2 ½ 0 ; 2 π Þ I . It is also worth noting that the prefactor in the diffusion equation is different between 2D and 3D diffusion . In 2D , h δ x 2 i ¼ 4 D δ t I . Correspondingly , the waiting time that enters Eq . ( 2 ) has to be modified into τ ¼ j 2 4 D ð 4 Þ Following a CHMP7 particle jump , the distance to the closest LEMD2 particle is measured . If this distance is within a collision distance , r c , the probability for a CHMP7 particle to combine with a LEMD2 particle and act as a single complex until decay is given by P CHMP7 þ LEMD2 ¼ F L 4 = 3 π r 3C N A 1 2 � e � Δ t = τ CHMP � e � Δ t = τ LEMD ð 5 Þ where N A I is Avogadro’s constant . The full derivation of this is given in ref . 70 . From Eq . 5 , we are free to either choose the value of r c to fix P CHMP7 þ LEMD2 I or vice versa . Here we choose the former , in particular using a constant value of r c = 50 nm . As the reaction is bidirectional , separation of the complexes was also considered . Provided that the decay rate is much lower than the inverse of the simulation time step , D L (cid:31) 1 = Δ t I , the probability of a CHMP7 – LEMD2 complex dissociating into its separate component particles per time step is defined as P split ; L ¼ 1 � exp � D L Δ t ð Þ ð 6 Þ Data visualization focused on the density of the LEMD2 - bound CHMP7 particles and the location of these complexes . Image processing . For the measurement of the increases in LEMD2 intensity and changes in micronuclei circularity following rupture ( Figs . 3f , 4c ) , the perimeter of the micronuclei was manually drawn using the LEMD2 signal as a membrane proxy . The z - section corresponding to the middle plane of each micronucleus was chosen . For the quantification of the CHMP4B – eGFP and CHMP4B 4DE – eGFP intensity at micronuclei ( Fig . 3b ) , the micronuclei area was segmented by Otsu thresholding based on the DNA channel . The ImageJ function ‘Analyze Particles’ was then used to define ROIs and the mean intensity for the GFP channel of each ROI was measured . A band - shaped ROI around the micronucleus was used to measure the mean intensity of the cytoplasm as the regularization factor . Image NATURE CELL BIoLoGY | www . nature . com / naturecellbiology Articles NATuRE CELL BIoLogy processing was performed using the ImageJ / FIJI software 57 . For quantification of TOP2B accumulation ( Fig . 6e ) , the area around the nuclei was selected according to DNA staining and the number of TOP2B foci was measured using the ‘Count Maxima’ function with tolerance values determined for each experiment depending on the imaging parameters . For the measurement of the CHMP4B and RPA2 fluorescence intensity at micronuclei ( Fig . 7b ) , the micronuclei area was segmented by Otsu thresholding based on the DNA channel . The ImageJ function Analyze Particles was then used to define the ROIs and the mean intensities for the CHMP4B and RPA2 channels of each ROI were measured . A band - shaped ROI around the micronuclei was used to measure the mean intensity of the cytoplasm in both channels as the regularization factor . For the quantification of the DOX wash - out experiments , the cells were washed twice with 1 × PBS after 16 h of DOX incubation ( 500 ng ml − 1 ) and fresh DMEM / F12 complete media without DOX was added to the cells . The same protocol was used for confocal microscopy , western blotting and real - time PCR . For the quantification of the number of CHMP4B foci at each time point , the area around the nuclei was selected according to DNA staining and the number of CHMP4B foci was measured for each cell using the ImageJ / FIJI ‘Count Maxima’ function . Tolerance values were determined for each experiment , depending on the imaging parameters . Three independent experiments were performed . All of the data points were plotted using GraphPad Prism .

Sample size In all experiments , trial runs were performed to determine what effect size was to be expected and how large and penetrant this effect was in the trial sample population . Based on this , we adapted the number and size of experiments to the expected effect size and the anticipated consistency between experiments . In support , the phenotypes described in this study are all highly penetrant and statistically significant . Data exclusions Seven datapoints omitted as they deviated markedly from other observations and represented extreme outliers that did not comply to the criteria established prior to the experiment ( in these cases , expression level of our transgene ) . This did not affect mean values and did not affect statistical significance . Replication We reproduced all our findings and the exact number of replications of individual experiments are indicated in the text . Randomization For each experiment and treatment we used an appropriate experimental group that was non - treated , carrier treated , or treated with control siRNAs as a reference to test for contribution of other covariates . Blinding Data acquisition for all live - cell microscopy was effectively blinded because phenotypes were not visible at the starting time of acquisition . Additionally , for fixed imaging , cells were selected for imaging based on channels ( e . g . DAPI ) other than the channel used for the experimental variable . Blinding for western blots was not relevant as the phenotype was only revealed after completion of the experimental pipeline . For high - throughput fixed microscopy , imaging field selection was random . Bias is avoided in the computer simulations , as each simulation data point is an average of 15 ( Fig . 5a , c , Extended Data Fig . 9a , b ) or 7 ( Extended Data Fig . 9c , d ) independent runs with the positions of the CHMP7 and LEMD2 particles initialized randomly .
