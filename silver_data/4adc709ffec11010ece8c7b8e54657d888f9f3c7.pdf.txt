Karger AG , Basel Introduction Tumor progression and metastasis depend on the for - mation of new blood vessels . Endothelial cells contribute to tumor angiogenesis and can originate from sprouting or co - option of neighboring preexisting vessels . Bone marrow - derived circulating endothelial progenitor cells ( CEPs ) can also contribute to the neovascularization and growth of certain tumors [ 1 , 2 ] . In clinical investigations , endothelial progenitor cells ( EPCs ) were recruited with high specificity to solid tumors [ 3 , 4 ] . Reports on the nu - merical contribution of EPCs to vessel growth are vari - able , ranging from low ( ! 0 . 1 % ) to high ( up to 50 % ) , and the differences are probably dependent on the type of an - giogenesis model used [ 5 , 6 ] . Circulating bone marrow Key Words Docetaxel (cid:2) Endothelial progenitor cells (cid:2) Neovascularization (cid:2) Paclitaxel (cid:2) Vasculogenesis Abstract Objective : Bone marrow ( BM ) - derived endothelial progeni - tor cells ( EPC ) play an important role in neovascularization and tumor growth . It has been reported that docetaxel and paclitaxel inhibit angiogenesis , but the effect of docetaxel and paclitaxel on EPC - induced neovascularization has not been examined . We aimed to clarify the cytotoxic and in - hibitory effects of these drugs on EPC . Methods : The effects of drugs on growth , tube formation , and migration of EPC were analyzed in vitro using a rat BM - derived EPC cell line ( TR - BME ) . Fluorescence - labeled TR - BME cells were injected into tumor - bearing rats and accumulation at the tumor site was analyzed by fluorescence - activated cell sorting ( FACS ) . Results : In in vitro cytotoxicity assays of these drugs in TR - BME , rat endothelial cell line TR - BBB and rat tumor cell line Walker 256 , the IC 50 values for TR - BME were higher than those for TR - BBB or Walker 256 . Both drugs inhibited tube formation and migration of TR - BME at lower concentrations than the cytotoxic IC 50 .

Accumulating evidence on EPCs in mouse tumor models , as well as in cancer patients , indicates that malignant transformation is associated with increased numbers of EPCs in the cir - culation [ 8 ] . Blocking EPC migration could inhibit neo - vascularization and tumor growth . The taxanes paclitaxel and docetaxel show significant activity against many solid tumors , both as single agents and in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents [ 9 , 10 ] . Paclitaxel and docetaxel are microtubule - stabiliz - ing drugs with clinical activity in the treatment of breast , ovarian , endometrial , prostate , and lung cancer [ 11 ] . Mi - crotubule - altering drugs inhibit the growth not only of tu - mor epithelium , but also of endothelial cells , most likely as a consequence of their disruption of the reorganization of the microtubule network required for the G 2 - M transition . Most cytotoxic anticancer agents have been found to sup - press angiogenesis [ 12 ] . Taxanes also exhibit antiangio - genic properties when used at low doses , by inhibiting en - dothelial cell proliferation , migration , and tube formation [ 13 – 16 ] . These findings were based on experiments using endothelial cells , such as HUVEC , but not EPCs , which also contribute to tumor vasculogenesis . The effect of tax - anes on EPCs has not yet been fully established . Generally , EPCs are identified by phenotypic co - ex - pression of CD133 ( AC133 ) , a cell surface marker unique to hematopoietic stem cells , and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor - 2 ( VEGFR - 2 / KDR ) , an endothe - lial cell marker [ 17 – 20 ] . We previously reported our new - ly established rat BM - derived EPC line , TR - BME , which expresses CD133 , VEGFR - 2 , CD34 , Tie - 1 , Tie - 2 , and CXCR4 . Furthermore , TR - BME showed incorporation of 1 , 1 (cid:3) - dioctadecyl - 3 , 3 , 3 (cid:3) , 3 (cid:3) - tetramethylcarbocyanine per - chlorate , spindle - shaped morphology , and tube forma - tion in the Matrigel assay [ 21 ] . Interestingly , TR - BME had a higher level of smooth muscle protein 22 ( SM22 ) than mature endothelial cells , and could differentiate into mu - ral cells in the absence of platelet - derived growth factor ( PDGF ) - BB [ 22 ] . In vivo , TR - BME mobilized to tumor sites , promoted tumor growth and increased microvessel density ( MVD ) in tumor tissues [ 23 , 24 ] . In this model , tumor growth was significantly suppressed when rats un - derwent total body irradiation . Although total body ir - radiation induced both BM suppression and immuno - suppression , BM suppression , which led to lack of EPCs , seemed to have more impact on the reduction in tumor growth . This is reasonable , because immunosuppressive cyclosporine A treatment increases tumor growth in the same tumor model [ 23 ] . The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of tax - anes on EPCs , and to define the contribution of taxanes to the inhibition of tumor vasculogenesis . Materials and Methods Cells and Chemicals The TR - BME cell line was established from the BM of tem - perature - sensitive SV40 large T antigen ( SV40 ts T - Ag ) transgen - ic rats , and has been characterized as a progenitor endothelial cell line [ 21 ] . TR - BME was cultured in human plasma fibronectin ( Gibco TM Invitrogen , Grand Island , N . Y . , USA ) coated collagen type I coated dishes ( Iwaki , Tokyo , Japan ) in EBM - 2 medium ( EGM - 2 Bullet Kit ; Clonetics , San Diego , Calif . , USA ) at 33 ° C , an active temperature for SV40 ts T - Ag . TR - BBB has been character - ized as a blood - brain - barrier cell line [ 25 ] . TR - BBB was cultured in DMEM ( Iwaki ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ; JRH Bioscience , Lenexa , Kans . , USA ) , 1 % penicillin - strep - tomycin - glutamine ( Gibco Invitrogen ) , basic endothelial cell growth factor , bovine brain ( bECGF ; Boehringer Mannheim , Mannheim , Germany ) , and 500 U of heparin sodium salt ( Wako , Osaka , Japan ) at 33 ° C , an active temperature for SV40 ts T - Ag . The syngeneic Walker 256 breast carcinosarcoma cell line , pro - vided by the Cell Resource Center for Biomedical Research ( In - stitute of Development , Aging and Cancer , Tohoku University , Japan ) was cultured in RPMI 1640 ( Invitrogen ) supplemented with 10 % FBS and penicillin - streptomycin - glutamine at 37 ° C . Cell Proliferation Assay Cells were seeded as 5 ! 10 3 cells per well in 96 - well plates and allowed to adhere for 24 h . Then , medium containing various con - centrations of docetaxel ( Fluka , Sigma , St . Louis , Mo . , USA ) or paclitaxel ( Sigma ) diluted in DMSO was added . The final concen - tration of DMSO was 0 . 1 % in all groups . After 24 h of culture in the presence of anticancer drugs , proliferative activity was deter - mined with the [ 2 - ( 4 - iodophenyl ) - 3 - ( 4 - nitrophenyl ) - 5 - ( 2 , 4 - disul - fophenyl ) - 2H - tetrazolium , sodium salt ] ( WST - 1 ) assay ( Cell Counting Kit ; Dojindo Laboratories , Kumamoto , Japan ) accord - ing to the manufacturer’s instructions . A WST - 1 solution ( 10 (cid:2) l ) was added to each well , and after incubation for 1 h , the con version of WST to formazan was measured with a plate reader at 450 nm . Migration Assay The migration assay was done using a Chemotaxicell ( Kurabo , Osaka , Japan ) as the upper chamber and a 24 - well plate ( Falcon , Franklin Lakes , N . J . , USA ) as the lower chamber . Polycarbonate filters with 8 - (cid:2) m pore size were coated with type I collagen and inserted between the two chambers . For the cell migration assay , TR - BME cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 with 10 % FBS at 37 ° C for 24 h and harvested by trypsinization . These cells were resus - pended in serum - free RPMI 1640 with or without taxane and plated on the upper chamber ( 5 ! 10 4 cells / 200 (cid:2) l / well ) . The low - er chamber was filled with supernatant solution of Walker 256 culture medium ( 700 (cid:2) l / well ) . After 2 h of incubation at 37 ° C , the cells on the upper side of the chamber membrane were removed with cotton swabs . Cells that had migrated to the lower side of the membrane were fixed in 60 % ethanol , stained with Giemsa , and counted ( five fields per filter ) under a microscope .

After polymeriza - tion of the Matrigel at 37 ° C for 1 h , the cells suspended in 0 . 5 ml EBM - 2 medium with or without taxane ( 4 ! 10 4 cells / well ) were transferred to the gel , and the plate was incubated at 37 ° C for 18 h . Total tube area was determined using a computer with the NIH Image analysis software . The lengths of enclosed tubes with - in the network were measured from five randomly chosen micro - scopic fields . The experiment was repeated 3 times . Results are expressed as means 8 SD of results from replicated wells . Tumor Volume in vivo Female Wistar rats ( 5 weeks ) were purchased from Charles River Japan ( Yokohama , Japan ) . The protocols of the animal ex - periments were approved by the institutional animal care and use committee . Docetaxel and paclitaxel were each dissolved in DMSO ( 0 . 01 M ) as a stock solution for the in vivo study . Rats were subcutaneously inoculated with 1 ! 10 6 Walker 256 cells in the posterior aspect of the right flank ( day 0 ) . For the in vivo study , 0 . 5 ml docetaxel stock solution or 1 . 5 ml paclitaxel stock solution were dissolved in 1 . 0 ml Cremophor ( Sigma ) and added to 3 . 6 ( docetaxel concentration 0 . 8 mg / ml ) or 2 . 8 ml ( paclitaxel concen - tration 2 . 4 mg / ml ) of PBS . The rats in the taxane - treated groups were injected with docetaxel ( 8 , 4 , and 2 mg / kg i . p . ) or paclitaxel solution ( 24 , 12 , and 6 mg / kg i . p . ) on day 3 . In the TR - BME - treat - ed group , TR - BME cells were labeled with a fluorescent reagent , PKH26 ( Zynaxiz , Malvern , Pa . , USA ) , according to the manufac - turer’s protocol . Labeled TR - BME cells ( 5 ! 10 6 ) were injected into tumor - bearing rats via the tail vein on day 3 , and the intra - peritoneal injection of anticancer drugs in the taxane - treated groups was done immediately thereafter . On day 7 , the tumor vol - ume was estimated as ( longest length ) ! ( shortest length ) 2 / 2 mm 3 . Resected tumors ( day 7 ) were used to prepare mononuclear cells for fluorescence - activated cell sorting ( FACS ) analysis and histological analysis in cryosections . FACS Analysis Tumor tissue was resected on day 7 from rats that had received fluorescence - labeled TR - BME and low - dose taxane ( 2 mg / kg docetaxel or 6 mg / kg paclitaxel ) as described above , then minced and dissociated in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 2 (cid:2) g / ml colla - genase , 0 . 3 (cid:2) g / ml hyaluronidase ( Sigma ) and 0 . 2 mg / ml DNase I ( Roche Diagnostics , Mannheim , Germany ) at 37 ° C for 1 h . The cell pellet was collected by centrifuging the cell suspension at 1 , 500 rpm at 4 ° C for 5 min , and washed twice with RPMI 1640 . The collected single cells were layered on Ficoll - Hypaque ( Phar - macia Biotech , Uppsala , Sweden ) and centrifuged at 1 , 600 rpm for 25 min at room temperature . The lymphocyte layer was collected and washed with PBS . These isolated cells ( 1 ! 10 6 / ml / tube ) were subjected to FACScan ( Becton Dickinson , San Jose , Calif . , USA ) analysis with CellQuest software . Immunostaining and Microvessel Density ( MVD ) Measurement Tumor tissue was resected on day 7 from rats that had received fluorescence - labeled TR - BME and low - dose taxane ( 2 mg / kg docetaxel or 6 mg / kg paclitaxel ) as described above . The tissue was frozen , immediately immersed in Tissue - Tek OCT com - pound ( Sakura Fine Technical , Tokyo , Japan ) and sectioned to obtain 6 - to 10 - (cid:2) m frozen slices . After peroxidase quenching , im - munohistochemical staining was done using a specific monoclo - nal antibody against CD31 ( Serotec , Oxford , UK ) . A Vectastain Universal Elite ABC kit ( Vector Laboratories , Burlingame , Calif . , USA ) was used as the second antibody according to the manufac - turer’s recommendations . 3 , 3 (cid:3) - Diaminobenzidine was used as the substrate and the sections were counterstained with hematoxylin . After staining , all of the intratumoral microvessels were counted in three fields on each slide at random . Statistical Analysis All values are expressed as means 8 SD . Statistical signifi - cance was evaluated using the unpaired Student’s t test for com - parisons between the two means . p ! 0 . 05 was used as the crite - rion of statistical significance . Results Cell Growth Inhibition with Taxanes We expected that the sensitivity of EPCs to taxanes would be different from those of other types of cells , e . g . peripheral endothelial cells and tumor cells . To analyze the difference in taxane sensitivity among these cell types , we evaluated the IC 50 ( the concentration at which the extent of inhibition was 50 % ) values for growth of TR - BME cells ( rat EPC line ) , TR - BBB cells ( rat blood - brain - barrier cell line ) and Walker 256 cells ( rat breast carcino - sarcoma cell line ) using the MTT assay . Both taxanes dose dependently inhibited the prolif - eration of each cell line ( fig . 1 a ) . For docetaxel , the IC 50 values for TR - BME , TR - BBB and Walker 256 were 116 . 7 8 24 . 9 , 54 . 8 8 28 . 6 and 73 . 0 8 33 . 9 n M , respectively ( table 1 ) . For paclitaxel , the IC 50 values for TR - BME , TR - BBB and Walker 256 were 908 . 1 8 326 . 8 , 156 . 4 8 94 . 9 and 730 8 204 . 9 n M , respectively . Thus , TR - BME was less sensitive to taxanes than TR - BBB and Walker 256 . However , TR - BME was about 5 - fold more sensitive to docetaxel than to paclitaxel . Effects of Taxanes on EPC Chemotaxis Next , we examined the effects of taxanes on physio - logical activities of EPC , i . e . migration and tube forma - tion . The effects of docetaxel and paclitaxel on EPC mi - gration were evaluated by means of chemotaxis assay . Dose - dependent inhibition of chemotactic migration of TR - BME was observed with both taxanes ( fig . 2 a ) . The IC 50 of docetaxel for migration of TR - BME cells was 0 . 0085 8 0 . 0014 n M , and that of paclitaxel was 0 . 0535 8 0 . 0134 n M ( table 2 ) . Chemotaxis inhibition by docetaxel was about 10 - fold stronger than that by paclitaxel . The concentrations of both taxanes required for chemotaxis D o w n l o aded b y : Y a l e M ed i c a l L i b r a r y 198 . 14 3 . 38 . 65 - 7 / 27 / 2 015 2 : 54 : 09 P M Effect of Taxanes on Endothelial Progenitor Cells Oncology 2009 ; 77 : 182 – 191 185 inhibition were quite low compared with those required for cell growth inhibition . Inhibition of Tube Formation by Taxanes Paclitaxel and docetaxel caused a dose - dependent de - crease in tube formation of TR - BME ( fig . 2 b ) , with IC 50 values of 16 . 78 8 8 . 01 and 1 . 13 8 0 . 66 n M , respectively ( table 2 ) . Docetaxel inhibited tube formation much more potently than paclitaxel ( fig . 2 c ) . The concentrations of taxanes required to inhibit tube formation were higher than those required for chemotaxis inhibition , but lower than those for cell growth inhibition . Antitumor Vascularization Activity of Taxanes in vivo We next evaluated the in vivo antitumor effect of in - traperitoneally injected docetaxel and paclitaxel against Walker 256 tumors in rats ( fig . 3 ) . The groups receiving higher doses of docetaxel ( 4 and 8 mg / kg ) and paclitaxel ( 24 mg / kg ) had a significant decrease in tumor volume compared with the control [ n = 3 , n = 9 ( control ) , p ! 0 . 05 , p ! 0 . 01 ] . However , lower doses of docetaxel ( 2 mg / kg ) and paclitaxel ( 6 and 12 mg / kg ) were ineffective . Next , we examined whether low - dose taxanes could inhibit EPC vasculogenesis . We have previously reported that TR - BME specifically accumulated at the tumor site and in - creased tumor neovascularization and tumor growth in a Walker 256 tumor - bearing rat model [ 23 ] . Here we found that co - administration of TR - BME significantly increased the tumor volume compared with the control group ( p ! 0 . 001 ; fig . 4 ) . Higher doses of docetaxel ( 4 and 8 mg / kg ) and pacli - taxel ( 12 and 24 mg / kg ) decreased tumor volume signifi - cantly compared with TR - BME - injected tumors without treatment ( p ! 0 . 05 , p ! 0 . 01 ) . At low doses , docetaxel ( 2 mg / kg ) also decreased tumor volume , and paclitaxel ( 6 mg / kg ) decreased it significantly ( p ! 0 . 01 ; fig . 4 ) . These low doses of docetaxel ( 2 mg / kg ) and paclitaxel ( 6 mg / kg ) had no tumor growth - inhibitory effect , but nevertheless inhibited the contribution of EPCs to tumor growth . Antitumor Vasculogenesis Activity of Taxanes in vivo We investigated whether docetaxel and paclitaxel in - hibited endothelial cell recruitment in vivo . Tumor - bear - ing rats that had received systemic administration of la - beled TR - BME cells on day 3 were given docetaxel or pa - clitaxel . On day 7 , the tumors were resected . Based on the difference in diameter between tumor cells and endothe - lial cells , small numbers of endothelial cells among tu - mor - derived single cells were detected using flow cytom - etry , as previously reported [ 23 ] .

Such accumulation of TR - BME cells was strongly inhibited by low - dose docetaxel ( 2 mg / kg ) and paclitaxel ( 6 mg / kg , n = 3 ; fig . 5 ) . At these doses , docetax - el and paclitaxel decreased CD31 + vessels in the tumor compared to the tumor of the control group ( n = 3 – 8 , nonsignificant ) . MVD of TR - BME - injected tumors was increased over the control , but there was a large reduction in tumor microvessels in the docetaxel - and paclitaxel - treated TR - BME - injected groups compared with the un - treated TR - BME - injected group , as evaluated by immu - nostaining ( means 8 SD , p ! 0 . 0001 ; fig . 6 ) . These results indicated that docetaxel and paclitaxel inhibit endothe - lial cell recruitment from the circulation into peripheral tumor tissues . This action may contribute to the tumor growth suppression by docetaxel and paclitaxel . Discussion Inhibition of angiogenesis is a promising strategy for cancer treatment . Most cytotoxic anticancer agents have been demonstrated to suppress angiogenesis to some de - gree [ 12 ] .

Grant et al . [ 16 ] examined the anti - angiogenic activities of taxanes on endothelial cells using HUVEC . Endothe - lial cells are 10 - to 100 - fold more sensitive to these drugs than tumor cells . Angiogenesis is blocked by the drugs primarily via inhibition of proliferation and differentia - tion and induction of cell death . Docetaxel , however , ap - pears to be more potent at inhibiting angiogenesis , with an IC 50 concentration 10 - fold less than that of paclitaxel [ 16 ] . Higher concentrations of paclitaxel than docetaxel are required to produce the same cytotoxic effect in many murine and human tumor cell lines [ 9 , 26 ] . To support tumor vascularization , EPCs must respond to signals released from the BM , home to the tumor site , and differentiate into mature endothelial cells . BM - de - rived hemangiopoietic progenitor cells can fully support tumor growth [ 27 ] and contribute to tumor neovascular - ization [ 28 ] , as demonstrated in BM transplant models . Therefore , an increase in EPCs or progenitor cells that could differentiate into endothelial cells may enhance the risk of relapse for patients , since these cells could contrib - ute to tumor revascularization [ 20 ] . It is thought that in - hibition of EPC migration and proliferation is the key for anti - angiogenic therapy . In this study , the rat endothelial cell line , TR - BBB , was more sensitive to taxanes than the rat breast cancer cell line , Walker 256 , whereas the EPC line , TR - BME , was less sensitive than Walker 256 in terms of growth inhibition by taxanes . On the other hand , TR - BME migration and tube formation were inhibited by very low doses of taxanes . The expression of endothelial marker and hematopoietic stem cell marker on TR - BME did not change during the treatment with taxanes , as de - termined by RT - PCR analysis ( data not shown ) . These data suggested that the anti - angiogenic effects of low - dose taxanes could be due to inhibition of EPC migration without any effect on cell viability or degradation of en - dothelial character in the tumor microenvironment .

We previously reported that TR - BME has both endothelial and hemato - poietic stem cell character in vitro ; these cells accumu - lated specifically at the tumor site and increased tumor growth and MVD in a Walker 256 tumor - bearing rat model [ 23 , 24 ] . Both paclitaxel and docetaxel inhibited cell growth at high dose , but inhibited cell migration and tube forma - tion at low dose in vitro . TR - BME accumulated at the tumor site in untreated tumor - bearing rats . Low - dose docetaxel or paclitaxel inhibited TR - BME accumulation at the tumor site and decreased tumor volume . These findings are consistent with the in vitro finding that low concentrations of taxanes inhibited EPC migration . CD31 - MVD has been recognized as a biomarker for tu - mor angiogenesis . An immunohistochemical study in re - sected tumors revealed that MVD was decreased by low - dose taxanes , although apoptotic cells were not increased in these tumor tissues ( data not shown ) . Therefore , we consider that low - dose taxanes inhibit EPC recruitment to the tumor site and contribute to the downregulation of microvessel formation , leading to tumor regression . However , it should be noted that in this study , it was not possible to determine the number of EPCs that were actu - ally incorporated into the tumor vasculature . In addition , since the tumor was rejected by the host after 3 weeks of tumor inoculation in our in vivo model , it was difficult to address the effects of taxanes on actively growing tu - mor and long - term effects of drugs . These are limitations of our study . Further study may be needed to examine these points . Spring [ 30 ] showed that CEPs have a role in late - stage tumor vascularization . Stoll et al . [ 31 ] suggested that dur - ing the early stage of tumor growth , CEPs might have a significant effect on tumor growth and angiogenesis , me - diated primarily by their localization in the tumor as opposed to their proliferation . Benezra’s group recently showed that the recruitment of CEPs into the tumor vas - culature depends on the tumor grade , as the CEPs distin - guished between well - differentiated and poorly differen - tiated prostate adenocarcinoma tumor cells [ 32 ] . There is growing evidence that CEPs can contribute to tumor an - giogenesis , but that contribution can vary depending on circumstances such as tumor grade , tumor stage , location of tumor growth and whether anticancer therapy has re - cently been initiated . EPCs are able to form highly prolif - erative endothelial colonies , whereas circulating endo - thelial cells have limited proliferative capacity [ 33 , 34 ] . EPCs play a functional role in vasculogenesis and growth of solid tumors , and may be useful as diagnostic or prog - nostic markers and as vectors for targeting cancers [ 35 , 10 0 0 5 10 15 20 10 1 10 2 FL2 - height 0 . 65 % TR - BME C e ll n u m b e r C o u n t s 10 3 10 4 10 0 0 5 10 15 20 10 1 10 2 FL2 - height 0 . 16 % TR - BME + docetaxel C o u n t s 10 3 10 4 10 0 0 5 10 15 20 10 1 10 2 FL2 - height 0 . 17 % TR - BME + paclitaxel C o u n t s 10 3 10 4 Fluorescence intensity Fig . 5 .

On day 7 , tumors were resected and the fluorescence intensities of dispersed single cells were analyzed by FACS . Endothelial cells were gated by forward and side scatter . Gated tumor - derived single cells are shown , and the data are rep - resentative of three individual experiments .

We have previously reported that the selective COX - 2 inhibitor DFU inhibited tumor vasculogenesis and tu - mor growth . DFU had no direct effect on EPC cell growth or chemotaxis . However , DFU inhibited the production of MCP - 1 , resulting in inhibition of EPC accumulation at the tumor site in this autologous model . One mechanism involved was that DFU decreased the production of an - giogenic factors by mononuclear cells ( e . g . macrophages ) [ 24 ] . On the other hand , taxanes directly inhibited EPC migration at low dose , without decreasing angiogenic factors in vivo ( data not shown ) . Regarding sensitivity to taxanes , endothelial cells ( HUVEC ) were more sensitive than tumor cells [ 16 ] , but EPC ( TR - BME ) had low sensitivity .

Interestingly , biologi - cal effects ( e . g . cell death ) on endothelial cells can be achieved using 10 - to 100 - fold less docetaxel than pacli - taxel [ 16 ] . Similar effects were seen with EPCs . In conclusion , we have demonstrated that low - dose taxane treatment inhibited EPC migration , tumor vascu - larization , and tumor growth . The mechanisms of inhibi - tion of the EPC migration remain to be established . These results indicate that CEP targeting may have potential for antitumor therapy . Acknowledgments We thank Dr .
