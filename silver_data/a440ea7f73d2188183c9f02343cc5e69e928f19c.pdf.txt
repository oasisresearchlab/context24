We demonstrate that the elasticity of these networks shows a strong dependence on the mean length of the actin polymers , unlike networks with small , rigid cross - links . This behavior is in agreement with a model of rigid ﬁlaments connected by multiple ﬂexible linkers . INTRODUCTION The actin cytoskeleton is a composite intracellular bio - polymer network . To tune the mechanical properties of the cytoskeleton for such diverse processes as cell division , locomotion , and shape , a large number of actin binding proteins organize network structure ( 1 ) . Nucleating and capping proteins regulate the polymerization of monomeric actin into ﬁlamentous actin ( F - actin ) . Cross - linking proteins bind the actin ﬁlaments together to form elastic gels or bundle structures , such as in stress ﬁbers and ﬁlopodia . Motor protein assemblies control tension within the net - works by pulling on actin ﬁlaments cross - linked to the network ( 2 – 4 ) . Even though the important molecular com - ponents are known , relatively little is understood of how this large ensemble of proteins collectively contributes to the mechanical response of the cytoskeleton . The complex and composite structure of the cytoskeleton makes studying the origins of the mechanical response difﬁ - cult . One approach has been to study reconstituted in vitro F - actin networks in the presence of puriﬁed binding proteins ( 3 , 5 – 9 ) . Reconstituting the network allows precise control of its chemical composition and systematic investigation of its properties . A ubiquitous feature of these networks is that they stiffen with increasing applied stress . When F - actin is cross - linked by small rigid cross - links , the stiffening arises from the properties of the ﬁlaments themselves . F - actin is a semiﬂexible polymer ; the persistence length is 17 m m ( 10 ) . Thermal ﬂuctuations cause transverse bending in the F - actin , which decreases its end - to - end distance . Application of a force stretches out these ﬂuctuations . For small extensions , the force is proportional to the extension , whereas for large extensions approaching the contour length , the force diverges , leading to strain - stiffening ( 11 ) . Both the linear and nonlinear network elasticities are con - sistent with the theoretical predictions for a network of semiﬂexible polymers , provided the deformation is afﬁne ( 5 , 7 , 12 ) . However , this picture of network elasticity implic - itly assumes that the elasticity is controlled by one com - ponent , the actin ﬁlaments . It ignores any contribution of the cross - linking proteins ; these can be both large and compliant , and therefore can themselves contribute to the elasticity . One example of a large and ﬂexible cross - link is ﬁlamin , which is abundant in cells . Filamin cross - links F - actin into orthogonal networks in the cortex , connects F - actin to integ - rins , and may play a role in mechanotransduction ( 13 – 17 ) . F - actin networks cross - linked by ﬁlamin exhibit a mechan - ical response that is qualitatively different from networks formed with rigid cross - links ( 6 , 8 , 18 , 19 ) . Filamin - F - actin networks are compliant , weakly elastic solids . Nevertheless , they can support large shear stresses because of their pro - nounced nonlinear strain - stiffening . Their nonlinear behav - ior is inconsistent with predictions for an afﬁnely deformed network with rigid cross - links ( 5 , 6 , 19 ) . In comparison to networks with rigid cross - links , networks cross - linked by ﬁlamin exhibit mechanical properties that more closely mimic the properties of cells ( 3 , 6 , 18 ) . Recent experimental reports show that the unusual nonlinear elasticity of these networks is consistent with a model of rigid polymers connected by multiple ﬂexible cross - links ( 19 – 21 ) . The rigid polymer of length L con - strains the deformation proﬁle of the n ﬂexible cross - links bound along its length , as shown in Fig . 1 ; thus , polymer length is predicted to be an important parameter controlling the linear and nonlinear properties of the network ( 21 ) . Indeed , the linear viscoelasticity and rupture stress of F - actin networks cross - linked by ﬁlamin are sensitive to the addition of gelsolin ( 19 , 22 ) , an actin - capping and sever - ing protein that shortens the average ﬁlament length .

In this article , we investigate the mechanical response of networks of F - actin cross - linked by ﬁlamin as we systemat - ically decrease L by adding gelsolin . Using bulk rheology , we show that the linear modulus increases proportional to L 2 . The critical strain , which marks the onset of stiffening , decreases with increasing L . In the nonlinear regime , the maximum stress before breaking is proportional to L . These results are contrasted with the rheology of a network formed with rigid cross - links to demonstrate that these behaviors are unique features of the ﬁlamin - F - actin system . Thus , we show that the linear and nonlinear elastic behavior of F - actin cross - linked by ﬁlamin is indeed tuned by varying L , in a manner that is consistent with the theoretical predic - tions for a network of stiff polymers connected by ﬂexible linkers . MATERIALS AND METHODS Proteins We purify monomeric ( G ) actin from rabbit skeletal muscle ( 23 ) , followed by gel - ﬁltration ( HiLoad 16 / 60 Superdex 200pg ; GE Healthcare , Little Chalfont , Buckinghamshire , UK ) . Aliquots of puriﬁed G - actin in G buffer ( 2 mM Tris HCl , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM DTT , and 0 . 005 % NaN 3 , pH 8 . 0 ) are frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at ! 80 " C . Recombi - nant human ﬁlamin A is puriﬁed from Sf9 cell lysates ( 24 ) . Recombinant human plasma gelsolin is puriﬁed ( 25 ) or purchased ( Biogen , Cambridge , MA ) . For rigidly cross - linked networks , we incorporate biotinylated actin monomers ( Cytoskeleton , Denver , CO ) that can be cross - linked by NeutrA - vidin protein ( Pierce , Rockford , IL ) . Network formation We form networks with an actin concentration , c A ¼ 0 . 5 mg / mL , unless otherwise noted , and control network microstructure by varying the molar ratio of ﬁlamin dimers / actin monomers , R F . We regulate the actin - ﬁlament length distribution with gelsolin . The molar ratio of gelsolin / actin mono - mers , R G , sets the mean actin ﬁlament length ( 26 ) . Samples are prepared by mixing solutions of 10 $ polymerization buffer ( 20 mM Tris - HCl , 20 mM MgCl 2 , 1 M KCl , 2 mM DTT , 2 mM CaCl 2 , and 5 mM ATP , pH 7 . 5 ) , gelsolin , ﬁlamin , and G - actin . Forrigidly cross - linked networks , biotinylated actin monomers are incor - porated in actin ﬁlaments at a molar ratio of biotinylated G - actin to nonbio - tinylated G - actin , R B . Cross - linking is mediated by NeutrAvidin protein . Samples are prepared by mixing 10 $ polymerization buffer , gelsolin , bio - tinylated G - actin , and G - actin . After 3 min , NeutrAvidin at a 1 : 1 molar ratio to biotinylated actin is gently mixed in . The sample is loaded into a microscopy chamber , consisting of two coverslips with a 1 - mm spacer , or between rheometer plates and polymer - ized for 1 h at 25 " C . Characterization of F - actin length distribution To characterize the actin - ﬁlament length distribution , we polymerize 0 . 3 mg / mL F - actin in the presence of gelsolin . After 1 h , the ﬁlaments are labeled and stabilized with a 1 : 1 molar ratio of Alexa - 488 phalloidin and incubated at 25 " C for 30 min . The ﬁlaments are diluted to a concentra - tion of 2 nM , and 5 m L of the suspension is pipetted onto a coverslip func - tionalized with poly ( acrylamide - co - diallyldimethylammonium chloride ) . A second coverslip is placed on top and the sample sealed . Nearly all ﬁla - ments stick to the coated coverslip . Immobilized ﬁlaments are imaged using a confocal microscope ( model No . TCS SP5 ; Leica , Wetzlar , Germany ) ; image pixel size is 160 nm . Filament contour lengths , l , are measured manu - ally in ImageJ ( National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , MD ) ; the minimum distance measurable using this method is 0 . 5 m m . For each gelsolin concen - tration , the width of the distribution of ﬁlament lengths s ¼ ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ " l 2 # ! h l i 2 q is nearly equivalent to the mean ( Fig . S1 in the Supporting Material ) . For network formation , we polymerize F - actin in the presence of gelsolin and ﬁlamin . In previous work , addition of a - actinin to gelsolin - regulated F - actin narrowed the width of the length distribution without signiﬁcantly affecting the mean length L ( 27 ) . Similarly , we expect that ﬁlamin should not signiﬁcantly change the values of L we measure here . Imaging For confocal microscopy , samples are ﬂuorescently labeled by polymer - izing in the presence of 0 . 6 m M Alexa - 488 phalloidin and examined ( model No . TCS SP5 ; Leica ) . For transmission electron microscopy , a 10 m L drop of assembled network is applied to a 400 - mesh carbon - coated nickel grid and incubated for 30 s , stained with 1 % uranyl acetate , rinsed by passing a drop of distilled water over the grid , then air - dried and imaged ( model No . 2100 ; JEOL USA , Peabody , MA ) . Rheology We use a stress - controlled rheometer with 40 - mm stainless steel parallel plates and a 160 - m m gap ( AR - G2 ; TA Instruments North America , New Castle , DE ; or C - VOR ; Bohlin Instruments / Malvern Instruments , Malvern , Worcestershire , UK ) . We polymerize samples in situ and use a solvent trap , applying a thin layer of low - viscosity mineral oil around the sample to minimize evaporation . We conﬁrm the results are independent of gap and reproducible within and between different protein preparations . The linear viscoelastic response is measured by applying a frequency - dependent , sinusoidal stress , s o sin ( u t ) , and measuring the strain , FIGURE 1 ( A ) Schematic of network of stiff polymers of mean length L connected by ﬂexible cross - links .

We maintain g o < 2 % to ensure linear response . The elastic modulus is G 0 ð u Þ ¼ ð s o = g o Þ cos ð d Þ ; the viscous modulus is G 00 ð u Þ ¼ ð s o = g o Þ sin ð d Þ : We measure the response in the nonlinear regime with a differential or ‘‘prestress’’ measurement ; a small amplitude oscillatory stress , ds , is super - posed on a steady prestress , s o , to measure the differential modulus , K ( ð s o ; u Þ ¼ ds = dg j s o : The elastic and viscous components are K 0 and K 00 , respectively . We conﬁrm there is no time dependence in K 0 at various levels of prestress and minimal hysteresis in K 0 ( s o ) ( Fig . S5 ) . In a complementary strain ramp approach , we increase the strain at a ﬁxed rate and measure the resulting stress . Both s ( t ) and g ( t ) are smoothed using a cubic spline algorithm to compute the differ - ential modulus K ¼ d s d g by applying a numerical derivative to the stress - strain curve . RESULTS AND DISCUSSION F - actin length distribution in the presence of gelsolin Within the cell , the contour lengths , l , of actin ﬁlaments are highly regulated . Typical lengths range from 100 nm to a few microns ( 28 , 29 ) . In vitro , high enough concentrations of pure monomeric actin will polymerize spontaneously in the presence of divalent salt and ATP . Yet , these in vitro ﬁla - ments are typically much longer than those in the cell , with contour lengths that can be up to 50 m m ( Fig . S1 ) . To better mimic the conditions in cells , we use the F - actin capping and severing protein gelsolin to vary the mean length , L ¼h l i , of our invitro actin ﬁlaments . To characterize the ﬁlament length distribution in the presence of gelsolin , we image a diluted sample of F - actin stabilized with ﬂuorescent phalloidin ( Fig . S1 ) . For the ratio of gelsolin / actin , R G ¼ 0 , the unregulated F - actin has a mean length of L ¼ 14 . 8 m m . Upon adding a small amount of gelsolin , R G ¼ 1 : 3700 , the length distribution is dominated by the presence of the gelso - lin and L decreases to 10 . 4 m m . Increasing R G decreases L further . We ﬁnd that L scales linearly with R G ! 1 , as shown in Fig . 2 ; it varies as L ¼ ( 330 R G ) ! 1 , with L measured in microns . This is consistent with a model where each gelsolin molecule associates with one actin ﬁlament . Each actin monomer adds 2 . 7 nm to the ﬁlament length ( 30 ) , so that 1 m m of ﬁlament is composed of 370 monomers , predicting L ¼ ( 370 R G ) ! 1 . Some inactivation of gelsolin during storage may account for the slightly larger observed ﬁlament lengths compared to the prediction . These ﬁndings are consistent with previous studies of actin - ﬁlament length distributions ( 26 , 27 , 31 ) . Microstructure of ﬁlamin - gelsolin - F - actin networks We form in vitro networks of actin ﬁlaments whose lengths are regulated with gelsolin and which are cross - linked by ﬁlamin . In vitro , ﬁlamin efﬁciently cross - links F - actin into orthogonal networks , which are soft but support large stresses ( 6 , 13 ) . These networks mimic several key features of cell mechanical properties ( 3 , 6 , 18 ) . The microstructure of these networks varies as we change L and the molar ratio of ﬁlamin / actin , R F . For R F ( 0 . 01 , the networks are a homogeneous mesh of F - actin as seen by electron microscopy ( Fig . S2 ) and confocal microscopy ( Fig . 3 , A and B ) . For R F > 0 . 01 , large bundles appear within the mesh ( Fig . 3 , C and D ) . The value of R F z 0 . 01 above which bundles appear is roughly inde - pendent of L ( 19 ) . From electron microscopy , the bundles appear as loose , branching structures with diameters ~ 100 nm ( Fig . 3 C , inset ) . These observations are consistent with reports for networks with ﬁlamin from chicken gizzard ( 22 , 32 , 33 ) . We conﬁrm this bundling transition by tracking the thermal motion of particles within the networks ( Fig . S3 ) . Varying L has little effect on the visual appearance of the nonbundled networks ( Fig . 3 , A and B ) . However , in the bundled networks , F - actin partitions more readily into the bundles at high R G , forming networks of pure bundles without a background F - actin mesh , as visible in confocal microscopy ( Fig . 3 D ) or detectable by particle tracking ( data not shown ) . This may be due to increased diffusion and decreased entanglements for shorter ﬁlaments , allowing them to more easily associate into bundles ( 32 ) . Linear response To probe the mechanical properties of the ﬁlamin - gelsolin - F - actin networks , we use a stress - controlled rheometer . For FIGURE 2 Mean F - actin length L as a function of the molar ratio of actin / gelsolin , R G ! 1 . L decreases from its unregulated value ( dashed line ) as gelsolin is added . ( Solid line ) Linear scaling . Biophysical Journal 99 ( 4 ) 1091 – 1100 Flexibly Cross - Linked Actin Networks 1093 an actin concentration c A ¼ 0 . 5 mg / mL and L ¼ 15 m m , a weakly cross - linked network having R F ¼ 0 . 001 is a soft , viscoelastic solid ( Fig . 4 A , squares ) . The elastic modulus G 0 is two - to threefold larger than the viscous modulus G 00 , and G 0 ( u ) increases as a weak power - law with the frequency , u , over a broad frequency range . This network is only slightly stiffer than purely entangled actin ( triangles ) . Increasing R F further to 0 . 01 only modestly increases G 0 and has little impact on the frequency response . This is in contrast to F - actin with rigid cross - linking induced by addition of NeutrAvidin to networks with a small fraction , R B , of biotinylated actin monomers incorporated into the F - actin . Increasing R B leads to a drastic increase in the stiffness of the network , as shown in Fig . 4 B ; this is accompanied by a decrease in the slope of the weak power - law frequency response of G 0 ( u ) , consistent with more solid - like behavior ( Fig . S4 ) . In the ﬁlamin networks , as we systematically decrease the mean ﬁlament length L from 10 to 2 m m by adding increasing amounts of gelsolin , G 0 decreases from 1 to 0 . 2 Pa ( Fig . 4 C ) . For rigidly cross - linked networks , G 0 also decreases with L ( Fig . 4 D ) . For both types of cross - links , the slope of G 0 ( u ) does not vary drastically with L . Dependence of the linear modulus on ﬁlament length To quantify the changes in the elasticity of these networks as we decrease L , we plot G o , deﬁned as G o ¼ G 0 j u ¼ 0 : 1 Hz ; as a function of L ( Fig . 5 A ) . For R F ¼ 0 . 001 , G o is 0 . 2 Pa for the networks with the shortest ﬁlaments , L ¼ 1 – 2 m m . As we increase L to 15 m m , G o increases to 0 . 5 Pa . For increasing values of R F , G o starts out at roughly the same value for short ﬁlaments , but increases more strongly with L . Interestingly , at each R F , G o increases stronger than linearly with L . This strong dependence on L is not expected from an afﬁne theory ( 11 ) that has been used to describe the linear and nonlinear elasticity of actin cross - linked with pointlike rigid cross - links such as heavy meromyosin and scruin ( 5 , 7 , 12 ) . In this theory , network elasticity is governed by the thermal compliance of the semiﬂexible F - actin poly - mers ; thermal ﬂuctuations of the F - actin get stretched - out as the network is deformed ( 11 ) . This model predicts G o ¼ 6 r k B Tl 2 p l 3 c ; where r is the linear density of polymer , k B is Boltzmann’s constant , T is the temperature , l p is the persistence length of F - actin , and l c is the distance between cross - links . Thus , in FIGURE 4 Linear viscoelasticity of cross - linked F - actin networks . Elastic moduli G 0 ( solid ) and viscous moduli G 00 ( open ) . Filamin cross - linked networks are soft , viscoelastic solids that become stiffer with increasing R F or L : ( A ) L ¼ 15 m m with various R F and ( C ) R F ¼ 0 . 01 with various L ( in m m ) . Rigidly cross - linked networks become stiffer with increasing L and signiﬁcantly stiffer and more solidlike with increasing R B : ( B ) L ¼ 15 m m with various R B , and ( D ) R B ¼ 0 . 01 with various L .

Biophysical Journal 99 ( 4 ) 1091 – 1100 1094 Kasza et al . this theory the network elasticity is controlled by the distance between cross - links rather than by the length of the actin ﬁlaments , in disagreement with our results for ﬁlamin - F - actin . Alternatively , the elasticity of our networks can originate from the compliant nature of the ﬁlamin cross - links . The large 160 - nm chain between the actin binding domains of a ﬁlamin protein is quite ﬂexible and can be modeled as a linear polymer with l p ¼ 20 nm ( 34 ) . As a result , a ﬁlamin cross - link is soft compared to an F - actin segment of length l c , which ranges from 0 . 3 to 2 m m . This suggests a model in which the compliance of the network is governed by the ﬂexible cross - links . The actin polymers are treated as rigid rods linked by many ﬂexible linkers , as depicted in Fig . 1 A . When the network surrounding a rigid rod is deformed , the linkers get stretched by an amount that increases linearly in the distance from the center of the rod , as shown in Fig . 1 C . Provided the network deformation is uniform on the length scale of L , G o ¼ 1 8 r nkL ) R F L 2 ; with k the stiffness of the ﬂexible cross - links and n the average number of cross - links per actin ﬁlament ( 21 ) . The explicit L dependence arises as a direct result of the nonuni - form deformation proﬁle of the cross - links . The average number of cross - links per actin ﬁlament is proportional to both R F and L and is given by n ¼ 370 R F L ; thus , the overall prediction is that G o will increase proportional to R F L 2 . To test this mechanism , we plot G o as a function of R F L 2 ( Fig . 5 C ) . The data for different cross - linking densities collapses onto a single curve . For R F L 2 R 0 . 1 , G o scales nearly linearly with R F L 2 , consistent with the prediction . This supports the model of crosslink - dominated elasticity . Below R F L 2 ¼ 0 . 1 , which corresponds to n ¼ 7 cross - links for a 5 - m m ﬁlament , the values of G o are roughly equivalent to the elasticities we measure for F - actin solutions in the absence of cross - linking , as shown in Fig . 5 C ( shaded bar ) . This suggests that the linear elasticity of these weakly cross - linked networks is dominated by the solution elas - ticity , not by the cross - links . The threshold of R F L 2 ¼ 0 . 1 corresponds to typical physiological conditions ( L ¼ 2 m m , R F ¼ 0 . 02 ) ( 35 , 36 ) , suggesting that by spatially or temporally regulating L , cytoskeletal elasticity could be adjusted from essentially that of entangled F - actin to a network with tunable stiffness . By contrast , the dependence of G o on L for the rigidly cross - linked networks is of a qualitatively different form ; G o increases linearly with L for small L but approaches a plateau for large L ( Fig . 5 B ) . Simulations of two - dimen - sional ( 37 ) and three - dimensional ( 38 ) stiff polymer networks reveal a dependence on L qualitatively similar to our results . The departure from the plateau for decreasing L in simulations has been attributed to an increase in the nonafﬁnity in the deformation of the network , where the afﬁne thermal theory is expected to break down . Nonlinear response The dependence of G o on R F and L is consistent with network elasticity that is governed by the ﬁlamin cross - links . We further test the origin of the elasticity by measuring the nonlinear elastic properties of the ﬁlamin - F - actin gels with two complementary techniques—strain ramps and prestress measurements . Strain ramps In the ﬁrst approach , we increase the strain , g , at a ﬁxed rate and measure the resulting stress , s . From the derivative of the stress - strain curve , K ¼ d s / d g , we quantify the nonlinear behavior . This technique has been used to study nonlinear behavior of both entangled and cross - linked F - actin networks ( 39 – 41 ) . For a ﬁlamin cross - linked network with L ¼ 15 m m and R F ¼ 0 . 01 , K normalized by its initial value , K o , is equal to 1 for small strains ( Fig . 6 A ) . At the critical strain , g c ¼ 0 . 06 , K / K o increases above 1 , and the network begins to stiffen . It stiffens 30 - fold before breaking at g m ¼ 0 . 9 . Networks with shorter ﬁlaments initially display weakening behavior , where K / K o decreases below 1 , due to their lower network connectivity , but eventually stiffen . As we decrease L , g c increases markedly , as shown in Fig . 6 A . By contrast , rigidly cross - linked networks with L > 5 m m stiffen at small strains , independent of L ( Fig . 6 B ) . Networks with L % 2 m m do not stiffen and display weak - ening behavior . This is consistent with a transition from stiffening behavior arising from pulling out ﬂuctuations in F - actin , where FIGURE 5 Dependence on L of the linear elastic modulus measured at a frequency of 0 . 1 Hz , G o . ( A ) For ﬁlamin networks G o increases stronger than linearly with L . R F ¼ 0 . 001 ( open ) , 0 . 002 ( light shaded ) , 0 . 005 ( medium shaded ) , and 0 . 01 ( solid ) . ( B ) Rigidly cross - linked networks show qualitatively different behavior . R B ¼ 0 . 01 . ( C ) G o for networks cross - linked with ﬁlamin at different R F collapse onto a single curve when plotted versus R F L 2 with nearly linear scaling above R F L 2 ¼ 0 . 1 .

Biophysical Journal 99 ( 4 ) 1091 – 1100 Flexibly Cross - Linked Actin Networks 1095 g c ¼ 1 6 $ l c = l p % is set only by l c and l p , to weakening behavior , where the network becomes too sparsely connected to stiffen . However , the strong dependence of g c on L for ﬁlamin - F - actin is inconsistent with such a nonlinear response arising from thermal ﬂuctuations of the actin ﬁlaments being stretched - out . We propose instead that the nonlinear response for ﬁla - min - F - actin originates from the stiffening behavior of the cross - links . Single molecule experiments indicate that ﬁla - min proteins stiffen markedly as they are stretched toward their contour length l o ( 42 ) . When the network surrounding a rigid rod is deformed strongly , linkers bound at the ends of the polymers are stretched most , as depicted in Fig . 1 C . These linkers will be the ﬁrst to reach full extension and stiffen , setting the critical strain at which the network begins to stiffen . These end - bound linkers reach full extension at a strain ( 21 ) : g c ¼ 4 l o = L : The L - dependence arises because the amount an end - bound cross - link must stretch to accommodate a given macro - scopic network strain increases with the length of the rigid rod to which it is bound . Plotting g c as a function of L ! 1 in Fig . 7 A , the depen - dence of g c on L ! 1 is in stark contrast to the stiffening behavior of rigidly cross - linked networks , which display no dependence of g c on L . The increase of g c with increasing L ! 1 is qualitatively consistent with the prediction of the model . We see similar behavior for g m ( Fig . 7 B ) , sug - gesting that the nonuniform deformation proﬁle of the linkers prevails up to large strains . Interestingly , the g c data from the two systems converge at small L ! 1 ( Fig . 7 A ) . In this limit of large L , the model of rigid rods with ﬂexible linkers predicts that the smallest of strains would lead to stiffening . However , this model relies on the linkers being the softest mode in the system . When the prediction for stiffening by the linkers would yield a lower g c than by the F - actin segments themselves , this picture breaks down , and it is no longer valid to assume the F - actin behave as rigid rods . In this limit , the compliance of the F - actin would FIGURE 6 Nonlinear stiffening in strain ramps with a rate of 0 . 1 / s .

Prestress measurements In our second technique for probing nonlinear response , we apply a steady prestress , s o , and probe the differential elastic modulus , K 0 ( s o , u ) , with a small oscillatory stress . This tech - nique has been used in cross - linked F - actin networks to study nonlinear stiffening behavior ( 5 , 6 , 12 , 41 ) . Rigidly cross - linked F - actin networks display stiffening with K 0 ~ s o3 / 2 ( 5 ) ; we see the same behavior for networks cross - linked by biotin - NeutrAvidin ( Fig . 8 B ) . This is consistent with the predictions for the afﬁne thermal model in which the nonlinear response is due to pulling out thermal bending ﬂuctuations in the semiﬂexible actin ﬁlaments within the network ( 5 , 11 ) . Our model of rigid ﬁlaments connected by multiple ﬂexible linkers predicts a qualitatively different stiffening behavior that arises from the stiffening of the ﬁlamin cross - links . The theoretical model is extended to the nonlinear regime by employing a self - consistent effective medium approach ( 19 – 21 ) . The linkers are bound on one side to the rigid rod and on the other to an elastic continuum with a nonlinear elasticity that is required to self - consistently represent a uniform and isotropic collection of such ele - ments . As the network is deformed , the linkers get stretched and stiffen one - by - one as they approach full extension and start pulling back on the effective medium . This model predicts K 0 ~ s o in the limit of a dense network . To test this prediction , we measure K 0 ( s o ) for the net - works cross - linked by ﬁlamin . For a network with R F ¼ 0 . 003 and L ¼ 15 m m ( solid circles , Fig . 8 A ) , K 0 increases with s o above a critical stress , s c ¼ 0 . 1 Pa , and reaches a stiffness , K 0 m ¼ 10 Pa , before breaking at s m ¼ 1 Pa . Networks with higher R F and L stiffen more and support larger stresses . For these networks , K 0 increases more strongly than linear in s o just above s c , whereas at high s o , K 0 ~ s o ( Fig . 8 A ) . This unusual stiffening behavior is in agreement with the prediction of the model . Rescaling K 0 by its initial value and s o by s c , the K 0 ( s o ) data for networks formed with different R F and L collapse onto a single curve , provided the network is not highly bundled ( Fig . 9 ) . Our rescaled data agrees well with the nonlinear response calculated with the effective medium model ( Fig . 9 ) , with only one ﬁt parameter that represents the coupling of a rigid rod to the effective medium . In contrast , the rescaled data from networks rigidly cross - linked by biotin - NeutrAvidin fall on a separate curve , which is well described by the prediction of the afﬁne thermal theory of cross - linked semiﬂexible networks ( Fig . 9 ) . These data support the model of crosslink - dominated elasticity in the ﬁlamin - F - actin networks . Interestingly , although the ﬁlamin - F - actin networks are all quite compliant , the maximum stiffness before breaking , K 0 m , increases strongly with R F , presumably because network failure is due to ﬁlamin unbinding ( 19 , 43 ) . Thus , FIGURE 8 Nonlinear stiffening in prestress measurements .

These networks also display stiffening behavior , but the maximum stiffness and stress are roughly the same for every sample . ( Line ) The s o3 / 2 scaling predicted by the afﬁne thermal model . FIGURE 9 Rescaled nonlinear stiffening of nonbundled networks with ﬁlamin ( solid ) or rigid cross - links ( light shaded ) at various values of R F or R B , L , and c A . Filamin data is consistent with model of rigid rods con - nected by ﬂexible linkers ( 20 ) ( medium shaded line ) , while rigid cross - link - ing data is consistent with model of semiﬂexible ﬁlaments connected by rigid linkers ( 5 ) ( dark shaded line ) . Biophysical Journal 99 ( 4 ) 1091 – 1100 Flexibly Cross - Linked Actin Networks 1097 the overall magnitude of stiffening , K 0 m / G o , increases with R F ( Fig . 8 A and Fig . S6 B ) . Of these networks the highly bundled ones show the most dramatic stiffening ( open symbols ) . The opposite behavior is observed for the rigidly cross - linked networks ; G o increases signiﬁcantly with R B , while K 0 m is nearly independent of R B ( Fig . 8 B and Fig . S6 B ) , presumably because network failure is due to F - actin rupture ( 12 ) . Dependence of the maximum stress on ﬁlament length Assuming cross - link unbinding as the dominant failure mode for these networks , a scaling argument based on the theoretical model predicts how s m scales with c A , R F , and L . Essentially , each cross - link will unbind from F - actin at a force , f m . With multiple cross - links per ﬁlament , the cross - links act in parallel , and the total rupture force per ﬁla - ment increases linearly with n . From the density of ﬁlaments and assuming an isotropic orientation of ﬁlaments within the network , the maximum stress is ( 20 , 21 ) s m ¼ 1 45 r nf m : Thus , as we increase L at ﬁxed R F , the number of ﬁlamins per actin ﬁlament will increase , and the prediction is s m ) n ) R F L : We ﬁrst look at s m measured in prestress experiments . In Fig . 8 A , we see that s m supported by the R F ¼ 0 . 003 networks increases as we increase L . To quantify this , we plot s m as a function of L in Fig . 10 A . Above a critical value of L , the maximum stress increases with L . This critical value of L decreases with increasing R F . Similarly , for ﬁxed L , s m increases roughly linearly with R F over a broad range of R F ( Fig . S6 A ) . For the highest values of R F , where the networks are highly bundled , s m increases dramatically ( open symbols , Fig . S6 A ) . For R F below a critical value , s m is roughly independent of R F . This critical value of R F decreases with increasing L ( 19 ) . We can collapse all the ﬁlamin data onto a single curve by plotting s m as a function of R F L ( 19 ) , as shown in Fig . 10 B . For R F L > 0 . 01 , s m grows nearly linearly with R F L , consis - tent with the prediction of the model . For smaller values of R F L , the network is rather weakly connected and breaks at very low levels of stress . The value of R F L z 0 . 01 corre - sponds to n z 4 . At physiological conditions , n z 15—sug - gesting that the cytoskeleton operates in a regime where it has high enough connectivity to support large external stresses or internal tensions compared to purely entangled F - actin without rupturing . The linear scaling with R F L or n suggests that failure of these networks is indeed deter - mined by unbinding of cross - links ( 19 , 43 ) . In contrast , s m for rigidly cross - linked networks is nearly independent of R B for R B > 0 . 001 ( Fig . S6 A ) ; this is consistent with rupture of F - actin at network failure ( 12 ) . We can also determine s m from the strain ramp measure - ments . In Fig . 6 A ( inset ) , we see that s m also increases with L for strain ramps conducted at a rate of 0 . 1 / s . Plotting s m determined in this way as a function of L ( squares , Fig . 10 A ) for R F ¼ 0 . 01 , we ﬁnd that these measurements of s m show similar scaling to the prestress measurements , and at this strain rate the values from the two methods nearly match . More generally , we expect that s m will depend on the rate of the measurement . The unbinding force for a single cross - link is expected to increase as the loga - rithm of the loading rate ( 40 , 44 ) . In an analogous macro - scopic measurement , we ﬁnd that s m increases as the logarithm of the loading rate on the network , again consis - tent with cross - link unbinding at network failure ( inset , Fig . 10 B ) . CONCLUSIONS The linear and nonlinear elastic behavior of ﬁlamin - gelsolin - F - actin networks support a model of crosslink - dominated FIGURE 10 Scaling of the maximum stress , s m , with L for nonbundled ﬁlamin networks .

The F - actin behaves as a rigid ﬁlament that constrains the deformation proﬁle of the ﬂexible cross - links bound along its length ; this leads to the unusual L dependence in the rheology of these networks . Our data suggest that the lengths of actin ﬁlaments within cross - linked cytoskeletal networks may be an important determinant of cell mechanics . Large , ﬂexible cross - links like ﬁlamin form compliant gels that can nonetheless support stresses that are orders - of - magnitude larger than those of purely entangled F - actin . The stiffness of these networks can be tuned over a broad range by external stress or internal tension ( 3 , 6 , 19 ) . In contrast , rigid cross - links form networks with a linear stiff - ness that is highly tunable by increasing the cross - link concentration , but show less dramatic nonlinear stiffening and tend to break at smaller strains ( 5 , 7 ) . Interestingly , the mechanical response of F - actin networks can be tuned between these two cases by systematically varying the molecular weight of a cross - link ( 8 ) . Many physiological cross - links are smaller and expected to be more incompliant than ﬁlamin ; within the cell these cross - links typically organize F - actin into bundles rather than orthogonal meshworks . For example , the a - actinin dimer forms an antiparallel rod of z 30 nm , and ﬁmbrin has two actin binding domains in tandem and is only z 12 nm . Indeed , rheological studies show that a - actinin - F - actin networks have highly tunable linear stiff - ness ( 45 ) , suggesting a - actinin behaves predominantly as a rigid cross - link . This also suggests that the cell may use large , compliant cross - linking proteins like the 160 - nm - long ﬁlamin dimers precisely because of the unique mechanical properties of the networks they form . In support of this view , ﬁlamin - F - actin networks mimic many key rheological features of cells ( 6 , 18 ) . This highlights the potential value of these results in providing insight into the behavior observed in cells .
