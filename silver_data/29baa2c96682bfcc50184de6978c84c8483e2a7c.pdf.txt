An emergent attractors model for idea generation process Simona Doboli and Vincent R . Brown Abstract - Behavioral research on brainstorming discovered many cognitive , social and motivational factors that affect the idea generation process in individuals or in groups . There are still aspects not completely understood , especially the effects of sharing ideas or providing hints . In this paper we propose a conceptual dynamic model of the idea generation process to investigate the dynamics of idea generation process . The model consists of a network of fixed concept units with inter­ connections determined by category membership and typicality of the unit . The novel feature of the model consists in the way ideas , represented as conceptual combinations , emerge in the conceptual network through a transient learning process . Simulation results show the effect of model parameters on idea generation process , and on convergent and divergent thinking . The model replicates results on the effect of hints presented sequentially versus simultaneously . I . INTRODUCTION Brainstorming is the process by which people come up with ideas for a particular problem . It can be done individ­ ually or in groups , verbally or in writing - electronically or on paper . Behavioral research on brainstorming has shown that groups , contrary to popular belief , generate fewer non­ repetitive ideas than a similar number of individual brain­ stormers . Nevertheless , groups are still believed to enhance , if not the number , then the quality or originality of ideas . It is believed that attending to others ideas , can increase the chances of activating one ' s otherwise distant knowledge , and thus increase the originality of generated ideas . But attending to others ideas can also inhibit or fixate one ' s own line of thought [ 1 ] . Among other causes that slow productivity in groups are social factors such as : competition for speaking time or production blocking ( i . e . interference with one ' s line of thought due to interactions with others ) , social loafing and free - riding , social comparison and competition [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] . Some social factors such as : increased motivational level or accountability [ 2 ] , [ 4 ] , [ 3 ] , help idea generation in both individuals and groups . Brainstorming electronically on com­ puters seems to be able to overcome some of the negative social factors such as production blocking and to narrow the gap between groups and individuals [ 5 ] . Other ways of controlling the idea sharing protocol with the aim of reducing the cognitive load due to group brainstorming , increase group productivity [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] . For example , priming with hints increases the number of idea generated , but in many cases it impacts positively both individuals and groups [ 8 ] , [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] . Similarly , decomposing the task or introducing short breaks between brainstorming sessions improves ideation in groups [ 6 ] , [ 11 ] .

The SIAM model by Nijstad and Stroebe ( 2006 ) [ 13 ] was derived from the SAM model of free recall ( Search of Associate Memory ) [ 14 ] . It represents the idea generation process as a repeated , two - stage search in the associative memory . The model showed that production blocking in group brainstorming interferes in both stages of the process and that shared ideas can activate less accessible knowledge . The associative mem­ ory model proposed by Brown et al . ( 1998 ) [ 12 ] represents knowledge as a semantic network of categories where ideas are generated from one category or another according to a Markov process . The model has a dynamical aspect that allows it to encode the effect of working memory , attention to ideas from others , represent convergent and divergent thinking and low - and high - accessible categories . The asso­ ciative memory model simulates several experimental results from individual or group brainstorming [ 12 ] , [ 10 ] . Both cognitive models can explain how ideas are generated from a high - level description of semantic memory and memory retrieval processes , but they cannot model specific ideas and the process of generating ideas which are novel and useful combinations of individual concepts . More recently , our group has proposed several neural models for idea generation [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] inspired by experi­ mental results on the neurobiology of semantic cognition [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] , [ 20 ] , [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] . The most comprehensive version of the model [ 25 ] , [ 26 ] represents semantic knowledge at different levels : features , concepts , categories , groups of categories and the idea generation as a guided dynamic search and reorganization process for useful and novel combinations of concepts , working across all levels of representation . The search is not random , but is guided by the features of a given problem context and by the existing organization of knowledge . At anyone time the search is focused in a sub - area of the search space , called the active search space . If the active search space does not lead to good ideas , as determined by an internal evaluation process , it is either expanded or narrowed by a modulatory inhibitory mechanism . The model is able to find good ideas in both familiar and novel contexts [ 27 ] , [ 28 ] and to replicate experimental results on priming with relevant ver­ sus irrelevant hints [ 26 ] , [ 16 ] . A simplified , continuous - time neural model [ 29 ] , [ 16 ] of conceptual - categorical knowledge was proposed to better understand the dynamics of search for novel conceptual combinations . The model represents each concept as coupled excitatory - inhibitory pairs of units - similar to the population model proposed by Wilson and Cowan ( 1972 ) [ 30 ] . Concepts are connected to each other via excitatory units in a manner that reflects the existing category structure . The idea generation process consists of transiently activating one or a small set of concept units , representing the current idea . The set of active units is determined by global inhibition , whose strength is modulated by a temporary de­ pletion and recovery mechanism that reduces the possibility of generating the same idea . In this paper , we present a novel model of conceptual knowledge , extending the one in [ 29 ] , [ 16 ] with a new mechanism for generating ideas as emergent , transient attrac­ tors formed on - the - fly from sets of co - active concepts . The concept units are modeled as in Gros ( 2009 ) clique model [ 31 ] . The activation of each unit decays slowly in order to limit the length of time a unit can stay active . The model was used to replicate experimental results on priming with hints from low - accessible categories versus high - accessible categories [ 29 ] . Simulation results show the link between model ' s parameters and those of the idea generation process and conditions which lead to convergent or divergent thinking mode . We replicate a set of experimental results showing that exposure to hints spread out uniformly over the duration of a brainstorming experiment reduces the drop out rate in the number of unique ideas [ 32 ] generated compared to the no hints condition or to a condition where the same number of hints is presented at the beginning of the experiment [ 10 ] . II . MODEL DESCRIPTION In this paper , we propose a model of conceptual space and study its ability to represent the idea generation process , emphasizing the dynamics of search for conceptual com­ binations . An idea is defined as a prolonged , but transient co - activation of a small subset of concepts . Connections between pairs of concepts represent associations between concepts in terms of the likelihood that one concept biases another for activity . These connections are asymmetric and their strengths can change dynamically as a function of the current context and recent activity in the network . The most important feature of the conceptual network is the dynamic formation of emergent , transient : Concepts with high , but similar activity levels start reinforcing each other , while at the same time inhibiting other concepts . Attractors emerge from noisy spreading activation along the initially asymmetric con­ nections . If the activity of an emergent attractor is large and lasts long enough it is deemed an idea . Emergent attractors die out due to the temporary increase in local inhibition . They are also forgotten , as the strengths of the connections revert slowly back to their initial values . Connections between concepts can change permanently , if positive feedback for an expressed idea is received . The conceptual model proposed here is most similar to a semantic network [ 33 ] , [ 34 ] . Semantic knowledge is organized both in a highly structured , but also flexible man­ ner in the brain [ 22 ] . Concepts are organized dynamically in categories based on their effective distance determined by the relevant features of the current context , previous experiences or beliefs and their semantic similarity [ 35 ] [ 36 ] . At least three conceptual spaces can be identified : the semantic or taxonomic space that organizes concepts based on semantic similarity , the associational space that groups concepts spoken together ( time associations ) and the contextual space that groups concepts in the same context or episode [ 37 ] . Relationships between concepts are variable , they can be symmetric ( semantic space and contextual space ) or asymmetric ( associational space ) . Word association studies typically find that words are not symmetrically associated [ 38 ] . Concepts are represented in the model in an abstract and amodal way ( i . e . each unit encodes a distinct concept ) . Theo­ ries of conceptual representation vary from modal ones [ 39 ] , [ 40 ] ( i . e . concepts are organized based on their perceptual features ) , to amodal representations [ 41 ] , [ 42 ] . More recently , Patterson et . al ( 2007 ) [ 20 ] has proposed a theory where concepts have a dual representation in the brain , a modal and an amodal one . There is evidence for distributed encoding of concepts and categories [ 21 ] in different brain areas : Patients with limited brain damage show category - specific semantic deficits . Amodal , category neurons were found in the inferior temporal and prefrontal cortex of monkeys [ 23 ] . However , in this model , we assume a pure amodal representation of concepts , since we wanted to understand how an instance of conceptual knowledge influences the process of finding associations between concepts . In the detailed model [ 15 ] , [ 26 ] , concepts and categories are represented distributedly and connect to features . We define an idea as a subset of co - active concept units . This assumption is equivalent with the bag - of - words ap­ proach used in natural language processing and information retrieval [ 43 ] . In this case , text ( such as a sentence or a document ) is represented as an unordered collection of words , disregarding grammar and even word order . This simplifying assumption has obvious limitations : ( 1 ) The same bag - of - words could be used to express different structured ideas ( e . g . sentences ) , and ( 2 ) Not any bag - of - words can be transformed into a structured idea . In the present model , we do not consider the issue of generating structured ideas , and assume that any conceptual combination produced by the model , that passes the criteria for an idea , can be converted in at least one useful structured idea . The model can produce novel ideas as novel conceptual combinations . A limitation of the present model is that it does not discover new concepts and express new ideas in terms of new concepts . We plan to address this issue in future work . Another limitation of the current model is that the ' ideas ' produced by the model are not evaluated for their usefulness . We assume that the conceptual network contains only concepts relevant to the brainstorming task . In the full model [ 15 ] , [ 26 ] we have a feature representation of both concepts and ideas that is evaluated internally by a critic for appropriateness to the current task . The emergent attractor mechanism by which sets of co­ active concepts become temporarily more strongly con­ nected , and , thus form a new attractor , relates to a phe­ nomenon observed in idea generation experiments [ 32 ] : the number of unique ideas generated over time decreases , while the number of repeated ideas increases over time . The emergent attractors increase the probability of a conceptual combination to be generated again in the future . A . Model details The conceptual model is composed of N concept units , organized in non - overlapping categories . There are M cate­ gories in the system , each with C units . Units tend to make more connections with units in the same category than in different categories ( i . e . they are more related ) . Units are either typical , atypical and regular units . Typical units make and receive more connections than regular or atypical units . Atypical units make and receive the fewest connections . Regular units are the ones which are not typical nor atypical . Pairs of categories are assigned a symmetric relatedness factor between 1 and 5 , with highly related categories having a value of 5 , while low related categories a value of 1 [ 11 ] . The relatedness factor determines the probability of connections between units in different categories . Concept units are modeled as in [ 31 ] . Each concept unit has an activity level denoted by Xi and a slow variable Si that acts as a delayed local inhibition . The output Xi is determined by : . . ( t ) _ { ( l / r �P ) ( l - x i ( t ) ) H i ( t ) X . - ( l / rfow n ) ( - Xi ( t ) ) H i ( t ) > eact H i ( t ) :: :; B act ( 1 ) where Hi ( t ) represents the overall influence on unit i from other units or from outside , global and local inhibition , and noise . The activity of a concept unit Xi increases up to 1 with a rate proportional with r �P and H i ( t ) when H i ( t ) is larger than a threshold value eact . Activity X i goes down to o with a time constant rfown if the value of H i ( t ) is below the threshold . Hi ( t ) is updated by the next equation : N Hi ( t ) = f ( Si ) ( 9 L WijXj ( t ) + 9sW ii Xi ( t ) + ( 2 ) j = l , # i + gext1rt ( t ) + 9c1f ( t ) - 9inhHinh ( t ) + 9nni ( t ) ) where f ( S i ) is monotonically increasing from 0 to 1 as follows : f ( Si ) = ( atan ( ( s i ( t ) - sa ) ) h ) - atan ( - sah ) atan ( ( l - sa ) h ) - atan ( - sah ) The parameters are : 9 the gain of inter - unit connections , 9s the gain of self - feedback connection , gext the gain of external input Iix t ( t ) , 9c the gain of context input If ( t ) , 9i nh the gain of global inhibition H inh ( t ) , 9n , the gain for the noise n i ( t ) . The local inhibition is modeled as a deple­ tion / recovery process of the S i ( t ) variable corresponding to an active / inactive unit [ 31 ] . The function f ( S i ) determines the influence of Si ( t ) on unit i . It is approaching 1 for Si ( t ) near 1 and 0 for Si ( t ) near 0 , with So. the inflection point and 'Y the slope . The global inhibition is computed as : H i nh ( t ) = LX i ( t»li inh X i ( t ) . The value of einh controls the signal - to - noise ratio similarly to the effect of dopamine in the brain [ 44 ] , [ 45 ] : a higher threshold lowers the signal - to­ noise ratio in the same way as low dopamine levels , allowing weakly active units to build up their activity , whereas a lower threshold increases the signal - to - noise ratio ( i . e . high­ levels of dopamine ) , allowing only strongly active units to stay active . Experiments shown that insight during creative problem solving is affected by dopamine levels and happens only when weaker units are allowed to become active ( i . e . lower dopamine levels ) [ 46 ] , [ 47 ] . The dynamics of the slow variable Si ( t ) is modeled as follows : ( 3 ) where rd and rr are time constants controlling the rate by which S i ( t ) deplete and , respectively , recover , e ( . ) are thresh­ olds . The slow variable S i ( t ) acts as a shunting inhibition on unit i : it goes down to 0 ( i . e . depletes ) when i is active and it goes back up to 1 ( i . e . recovers ) when i is inactive . The weight between two units ( Wij ) is set initially to a positive random value between 0 and 1 and represents the strength of the association of concept j to concept i . Since the association between two concepts is usually asymmetric [ 38 ] , the weights and connections between a pair of concept units are also asymmetric . Thus , initially the network has no stored attractors . The mechanism of forming emergent attractors is based on short - term adaptation of connection strengths and works as follows : pairs of concept units whose activities X ( . ) ( t ) are close together , are higher than a threshold e S , and are going up , undergo a synchronization process , detailed below . Pairs of concept units whose activity is greater than a threshold e D and are far apart undergo a desynchronization process . The updating mechanism practically synchronizes temporarily the activity of a small set of almost active concept units , while de synchronizing units with activity levels far apart . The f ( Si ) values will eventually shut down an emergent attractor , and thus , allowing another attractor to form . In parallel , all connection strengths recover to their initial values and the emergent attractors disappear . Synchronization increases the strength of the connections between two pairs of concept units to at most 1 , if the units are connected by at least one non - zero connection . The synchronization equation for Wij ( t ) ( the same for Wji ( t» is as follows : if S is true otherwise ( 4 ) S : Xi ( t ) , Xj ( t ) > eS , IXi ( t ) - xj ( t ) 1 < fS , ( 5 ) H i ( t ) , Hj ( t ) > eact , min ( Wij , Wji ) > 0 where Wij and Wji are the initial , steady state values of the weights . The de synchronization process decreases the strength of a connection from unit j to unit i to at most - 1 , as shown below : Wij ( t ) = { � ( 1 + Wij ( t ) ) if D is true otherwise ( 6 ) D : Xi ( t ) , Xj ( t ) > e D , X j ( t ) - X i ( t ) > E D , ( 7 ) H i ( t ) , Hj ( t ) > e act Desynchronization can temporarily change the strength of a connection from positive to negative values . While this is not biologically plausible , the units in the model are not real neurons , but can be considered population of neurons active when one thinks of a particular concept is active . The brain has many inhibitory mechanisms , both specific and global . In particular a special type of inhibition was found to be controlled by excitatory cortical neurons [ 48 ] . A continuous recovery mechanism brings the strength of the connections back to their initial , steady - state values . If weights are higher than the initial values , they are going down with a time constant Te and if they are lower , they are going up with a time constant Ti . The different time constants allow the model to control separately the effect of synchronization ( Te ) from that of desynchronization ( Ti ) . A smaller Ti is chosen for a fast recovery from desynchro­ nization , while a longer Te keeps the past ideas generated in memory longer . III . SIMULATION RESULTS A model with the following parameters was simulated : N = 500 , M = 10 , C = 50 . Out of N units , 30 % were selected to be typical , 20 % atypical and the remaining 50 % regular units . Within each category , typical units receive more incoming connections from all other units and make more outgoing connections than other unit types . Atypical units make and receive the least number of connections , with a preference for outgoing connections to typical units . Probability of connection between two units in different categories is determined by a pairwise category relatedness factor between 1 and 5 , ranging from 0 . 01 for least related to 0 . 1 for most related categories . The values of the rest of the parameters are listed in Appendix . First , we tested the ability of the conceptual network ' s activity to spread over a few number of co - active units , that stay on transiently . An idea is recorded as the set of co - active concept units that remain on for longer than a threshold value e i de a = 2 . The threshold value is equal to 200 integration steps ( see Appendix ) and , thus ensures that only sustained activity is counted as an idea and . Figure 1 plots the activity of all concept units ( X ( t ) ) grouped in M = 10 categories with the synchronization / desynchronization mech­ anism for updating the connection weights . Figure 2 shows X ( t ) obtained with the same network , but without changing connection strength values . In Figure 1 , there are blobs of activity representing concept units that come on and off in a synchronized manner ( i . e . emergent attractors ) , while in Figure 2 , there are no such blobs . To better quantify the effect of updating the weights , we measured the mean number of unique ideas generated by 3 �------��------------------���� o 10 20 w � � M ro M 00 100 Time Fig . I .

The following parameter values were used : ginh = 0 . 5 and (}in h = 0 . 1 . five networks with ( 16 ) and without updating ( 5 . 8 ) , and the mean time duration of unique ideas : 4 . 37 with updating and 2 . 78 without updating . The networks with weight updating generate more unique ideas , and these ideas last on average about 1 . 5 times longer than without weight updating . Next , we studied the idea generation process in networks with different values of the global inhibition parameters : the gain ( g i n h ) and the threshold ( e i nh ) . We expect a high ei nh to allow weakly biased units to become active , and thus to increase the number of visited concepts and the number of ideas with active concepts distributed over more than one category . Figure 3 shows the mean and standard deviation obtained over five networks for the following measures : ( a ) quantity as the number of non - repeated ideas over T = 100 , ( b ) flexibility as the number of categories in which non - repeated ideas are generated , ( c ) clustering as the ARC ( Adjusted Ratio Clustering ) coefficient [ 13 ] , [ 11 ] as a measure of the number of consecutive ideas generated repeatedly in the same category ( i . e . the clustering of ideas ) , ( d ) number of visited concepts in non - repeated ideas , ( e ) number combinations as the number of non - repeated ideas where a combination of concepts was active ( i . e . at least two concept units active ) and ( t) number category combinations as the number of non - repeated ideas spread over concepts in at least two categories . The four bars correspond to four combinations of values for the inhibition and threshold gain : g i nh is either 0 . 5 ( L ) or 0 . 7 ( H ) and ei nh is either 0 . 1 ( L ) or 0 . 3 ( H ) . The left letter on the two letter combination under each bar denotes the value of g i nh and the right letter that of einh . The expectation was that a larger inhibition gain will reduce the number of co - active units ( Figure 3 ( e ) ) , while a larger e inh will decrease the signal - to - noise ratio and allow weaker active units to become active . Figure 3 ( a ) shows that a higher number of non - repetitive ideas is generated for the high value of einh . Flexibility is slightly higher for a low value e i nh , but the values are very similar ( Figure 3 ( b ) ) . This indicates that probably flexibility is intrinsic in the connections of the circuit or depends on another parameter . Clustering is higher for a high value of einh , indicating that active units , tend to activate other units in the same category , since those are more likely to have a higher activity below the summation threshold for inhibition ( Figure 3 ( c ) ) . In Figure 3 ( d ) , the number of visited concepts is lower for a high level of inhibition , and it is the highest for low inhibition and high ei nh ( low signal - to - noise ) . The number of combination ideas is higher for high einh ( Figure 3 ( e ) , but the number of ideas spread over more categories is in general very low ( Figure 3 ( t) ) and is lower for a high level of inhibition . An interesting , somewhat counterintuitive effect , is the correlation of high clustering with a high number of combination ideas ( Figure 3 ( c ) and ( e ) ) for high einh . This indicates that combinations come mostly from consecutive ideas in the same category . This is due to the larger number of connections within a category which increase Hi ( t ) values on units inside the active category under conditions of decreased inhibition . Also , the number of conceptual combinations over multiple categories does not seem to be depend on the two parameters tested . Next , we looked for network determinants of convergent or divergent mode of idea generation . In convergent mode , most activity spreads to units in one category only , ideas are generated repeatedly from one category and category switches occur rarely . This corresponds to a focused mode of thinking . Divergent mode corresponds to an activity that spreads over multiple categories , either simultaneously or not . Novel conceptual combinations occur when two or more concepts , usually unrelated are activated together . Since , con­ cepts in different categories are less likely to be connected , it is important for the system to be able to combine concepts from different categories in the same idea . New ideas are ( a ) Quantity ( b ) Flexibility 30 10 8 20 6 4 10 2 0 0 H / L H / H UL lIH H / L H / H lIL lIH ( c ) Clustering ( d ) Number visited concepts 60 0 . 8 40 0 . 6 0 . 4 20 0 . 2 0 0 H / L H / H UL L / H H / L H / H lIL lIH ( e ) Number Combinations ( I ) Number Category Combinatins 4 2 0 H / L H / H UL UH H / L H / H UL UH Fig . 3 . Each bar represents the mean ( black part ) and standard deviation ( white part ) of the measure denoted on top of each graph ( a to e ) and over five different networks . Each network was simulated in all four conditions . Starting with the leftmost bar in each graph , the conditions varied are : H / L ( ginh = 0 . 7 / 0 inh = 0 . 1 ) , H / H ( g inh = 0 . 7 / 0 inh = 0 . 3 ) , LlL ( ginh = 0 . 5 / 0 inh = 0 . 1 ) , LlH ( ginh = 0 . 5 / 0 inh = 0 . 3 ) . thought to be novel conceptual combinations [ 49 ] , [ 50 ] of old concepts . The associative memory theory of creativity [ 49 ] predicts that the type and strength of associations between concepts ( i . e . flat versus steep ) is related to the ability to form new , distant associations , whereas the conceptual transforma­ tion theory [ 51 ] implies a reorganization of the conceptual space as a basis of novel ideas . We are interested in finding conditions in which the following three modes of operation exist ( either in the same network or in different networks ) : convergent - activity stays within a category for a long time , weak divergent - activity stays within a category shorter than in the convergent mode and strong divergent when activity can spread over multiple categories at the same time . We run simulations in which we changed the mean and standard deviation of the normal distribution from which connection strengths are drawn , but kept the same connectivity and other parameters . In the first case , denoted high std , the mean and standard deviation for connections between units in the same category are f.LY! = 0 . 5 , stdy! = 0 . 5 and between different categories are f.L'Ht = 0 . 3 , std'Ht = 0 . 7 . In the second case , denoted as low std , the parameters for within category connections are f.LY! = 0 . 5 , stdy! = 0 . 2 and between category connections are f.L'Ht = 0 . 5 , std'Ht = 0 . 2 . Figure 4 ( a to c ) shows the mean and standard deviation over five networks of : ( a ) clustering , ( b ) number of conceptual combination ideas ( i . e . two or more active concepts ) , ( c ) number of category conceptual combination ideas ( i . e . two or more active concepts from two or more categories ) . It can be seen that the low std network ( the right most bar in each plot ) has a higher clustering coefficient ( Figure 4 ( a ) ) and lower number of category conceptual combinations ( Figure 4 ( c ) , while both visiting a similar number of conceptual combinations ( Figure 4 ( b ) ) . Thus , a network with the same connectivity , but a flatter distribution of connection strengths exhibits a more divergent behavior than a steeper distribution . Since the effective distance or strengths between concepts is dynamically determined by the combined influence of con­ text , associational , past experiences or beliefs , the mechanism of changing distribution of connections strength might be used to switch from divergent to convergent thinking .

The effect of primes on the idea generation process is explored next . One of the most beneficial effects of group brainstorming is thought to result from attending to others ideas and thus , possibly accessing low - accessible conceptual knowledge that would not be used [ 12 ] . In [ 29 ] we modeled the effect of hints from low - versus high - accessible cate­ gories on the number of ideas generated . This model has a different representation for concept units and a novel weight adaptation mechanism ( i . e . emergent attractors ) . Figures 5 and 6 show the activity of a network in response to an initial prime from a high - accessible category ( Figure 5 ) and in response to an initial prime from a low - accessible category ( Figure 6 ) . Categories 1 to 3 are low - accessible , having the smallest relatedness factor ( 1 ) with all other categories , categories 4 to 6 have medium accessibility with a relatedness of3 with remaining categories and categories 7 to 10 are highly accessible , with a relatedness of 5 ( maximum ) among themselves . The prime is given by activating a small number of units from either a low - accessible or a high­ accessible category . It can be seen that in the high - accessible priming , the activity of the network does not spread to the low - accessible categories , while in the bottom case it does , due to the prime . In the next set of simulations , we model the effect of 9� __ __________ � � __ __________________ -1 5 �----------------------------------� 4� ____________________________________ -1 3� ________________________________________ � 2� ____________________________________ -1 o 10 20 30 40 50 60 Time 70 80 90 100 Fig . 5 .

Primes from 10 categories are given either all at the beginning of a 30 minute session , simultaneous condition , or one at each 3 minutes interval , sequential condition . Behavioral experiments showed that sequential priming leads to a slower decrease in number of ideas generated in 3 minute bins , than simultaneous priming . Figure 7 shows the results obtained with the model in the sequential , simultaneous and no priming conditions . The primes in the sequential case are presented at the beginning of each interval ( every 3000 integration steps ) as a slowly decaying context input ( Ii ( t ) ) ) over all nodes in a category . In the simultaneous case , the primes had the same effect , but they were spaced closer together ( every 200 integration steps ) . The no primes condition was simulated by biasing at the beginning of the simulation all nodes in one category - the category with most typical nodes . The order in which category primes were presented in the sequential and simultaneous conditions was in decreasing order of the number of typical units in each category ( in the actual experiment , categories were ordered in decreasing order of the number of subcategories ) . The model results are similar to experimental results : The number of non - repetitive ideas stays about the same throughout the simulation for the sequential condition , but it goes down in the simultaneous and no priming conditions . 3 6 9 1 2 15 18 21 2 4 2 7 30 Time Fig . 7 .

Sequential priming is denoted with circles , simultaneous priming with stars and no priming with triangles . Other parameter values are : g in h = 0 . 7 and (} inh = 0 . 1 . IV . CONCLUSION In this paper we propose a model of emergent attractors for the idea generation process . The model encodes a network of concept units , with concept units having a slow variable that shuts down the unit after prolonged activity ( similar to population models of excitatory - inhibitory units , but with a simpler dynamics ) [ 31 ] . A novel feature consists in the syn­ chronization / desynchronization mechanism for discovering and forming emergent and transient attractors . These attrac­ tors are formed temporarily by the synchronization process that matches the connection strengths between pairs of con­ cept units with similar activity , while the desynchronization process decreases the weights to dissimilar and low activity units . Simulation results show the effect of forming emergent attractors on the idea generation process , the effect of various parameters on several measures of quantity and quality of ideas generated , conditions for convergent / divergent modes , and the effect of primes . These preliminary results show that the model is flexible enough to model various types of brainstormers . In future work , we plan to further explore the effect of network structure and connectivity on the idea generation process and on extending the model for group brainstorming settings .

V . ApPENDIX The values of the remaining parameters of the model is listed are listed here : Gain values ( equation 3 ) are : 9 = g8 = gc = g n = 1 , g i = 0 . 5 or 0 . 7 ( see below ) . The parameters for updating X i ( t ) ( equation 1 ) are : T UP = 0 . 1 , Td ow n = 1 , eact = 0 . 2 . The value of Tdow n must be larger than that of T UP to ensure a concept unit has enough time to come and stay on , instead of immediately being shut down . The parameters for updating Si ( t ) ( equation 3 ) where chosen to ensure that ! ( Si ) has a steep enough curve to effectively shut down the H i ( t ) value on an active unit Sa = 0 . 5 and l' = 0 . 1 . The parameters for updating Si ( t ) ( equation 3 ) are Td = 5 , T r = 20 , e d = e r = 0 . 7 . The parameters to synchronize the connection strengths for two concept units are eS = 0 . 1 , ES = 0 . 1 , while those to desynchronize them are eD = 0 . 3 and ED = 0 . 1 . The connection strengths recover to their initial , steady - state values with time constants T i = 1 and T e = 150 . All differential equations were simulated with second and third order Runge - Kutta method with a maximum integration step of 0 . 01 . REFERENCES [ I ] S . M .
