This issue of the Stem Cell International journal contains papers from many of the leading scientists in the emerging ﬁeld : ex vivo expansion of hematopoietic progenitor cells into erythrocytes for transfusion . Blood transfusion , the ﬁrst form of successful cell therapy and , at least to some , “transplantation” , was inspired by the discovery of the circulation by Richard Harvey in the 1600s [ 1 ] and begun in earnest later in that century . The development of this clinical practice into the safe and routine therapy we all know today has been both an exciting scientiﬁc adventure and the foundation for a number of other scientiﬁc disciplines . More speciﬁcally , the immunology of transfusion and transplantation began with the discovery of the heterogeneity of human blood group antigens by Dr . Karl Landsteiner in 1901 ( recognized with a Nobel Prize in 1930 ) . The discovery of clinically relevant infectious diseases transmitted by transfusion played an important role in the development and advancement of virology . The inheritance of certain form of anemias was discovered during blood transfusion practice and led to development of the genetics of human red cell disorders . In the 1940 – 1950s , the establishment of blood banks followed by the development of rigorous donation criteria and standardization of blood manufacturing processes has made transfusion safe and widely available and has provided a paradigm for the development of emerging therapies using ex vivo expansion and di ﬀ erentiation of many cell types . An example of one such therapy is represented by the tumor immunotherapy described by Lapteva and Vera . The blood supply of industrialized countries is adequate overall . Nearly one hundred million donations are made every year worldwide ( http : / / www . who . int / mediacentre / factsheets / fs279 / en / index . html ) . The availability of blood and blood products in these nations has permitted the development and implementation of numerous life - saving surgical procedures ( open heart surgery , organ transplanta - tion , damage control resuscitation for trauma , and others ) and cancer treatments which were not even imaginable without assurance that blood for transfusion would be readily available and safe . However , blood is not an unlimited resource and its potential need as the world rapidly develops requires a signiﬁcant increase in blood donation . By some estimates ( CDH ) , given the world’s population and given the per capita transfusion of Canada as a utilization benchmark , nearly 250 million whole blood donations would be needed . Furthermore , and despite its high level of safety , human donated , unit - by - unit - derived blood donation / transfusion ( i . e . , without batched blood manufacturing into an aliquoted and homogenized pharmaceutical product ) , still leads to morbidity and mortality of its own accord and has signiﬁcant variation from product to product based on the nature of the collection , manufacturing and storage processes , and the antigenic variation of any given donor , amongst others . Finally , it is not known what e ﬀ ect the aging of the world’s population will have both on per capita utilization and on the ability of the smaller , younger populations to donate [ 2 ] . These issues , and the nearly 20 - year - old search for alternative products to meet the transfusion need are discussed in the paper by Whitsett et al . Scientiﬁc research is inspired by the prospect of a clinical goal . In recent years , a revolution in stem cell biology has occurred that has far reaching implications , speciﬁcally , 2 Stem Cells International the discovery that it is possible to generate a potentially unlimited supply of stem cells by epigenetic / genetic treat - ments of somatic cells ( T cells , ﬁbroblasts , others ) from any individual ( see Pourcher et al . , Hyroyama et al . , and Chang et al . ) . In addition , techniques have been discovered to reprogram any cell into another cell type avoiding the induction of pluripotency . These techniques are fascinating though there are numerous scientiﬁc , safety , and scaling - up issues to be resolved before cells which have been genetically “altered” in the laboratory may be considered ready for widespread clinical use . As red blood cells do not have a nucleus , it is possible that they will be accepted as genetically safe . Indeed , it is this notion that supports that red blood cells from Hematopoietic stem / progenitor cell expansion or redi ﬀ erentiation may represent the ﬁrst therapeutic product to be generated by genomic reprogramming technology . Reprogramming technology is still under development . Therefore , red blood cells expanded ex vivo from primary stem cell sources currently discarded ( bu ﬀ y coats produced during the blood manufacturing processes and low - volume umbilical cord blood ) are being considered for ﬁrst - in - man studies . Tirelli et al . identify the cell populations present in adult blood which are responsible for massive production of red blood cells ex vivo . The ﬁrst - in - man proof - of - principle study for the use of in vitro expanded red blood cells for transfusion was reported on September 1st 2011 , by Luc Douay and colleagues [ 3 ] , who have also coauthored Pourcher et al . This paper reported that red blood cells generated in vitro from mobilized CD34 pos cells collected by apheresis have normal survival ( determined by 51 Cr labeling ) when transfused into an autologous recipient [ 3 ] . This ﬁrst - in - man autologous transfusion described also what would be the most likely safety data necessary for a larger clinical study with such products [ in vitro characterization ( blood group antigen expression proﬁling , deformability , hemoglobin content and O 2 dissociation curves ) and in vivo functional studies in animal models ( survival and morphology ) ; http : / / www . clinicaltrials . gov / ct2 / show / NCT00929266 ] . In vivo functional studies of human red blood cells in animal models will likely allow more complete characterization in many ways [ 4 ] . Ghinassi et al . describe an improved animal model which allows in vivo imaging and cell fate determination of human erythroid cells by labeling the cells before transfusion with a ﬂuorescent reporter gene by retroviral technology . Although red blood cells do not have nuclei , their immediate precursors the erythroblasts do . The terminal maturation of erythroblasts into functional red cells requires a complex remodeling process which ends with extrusion of the nucleus and the formation of an enucleated red blood cell [ 5 ] . These late stages of maturation are intrinsically controlled by epigenetic / genetic expression programs of the erythroblast itself . Cell reprogramming methodologies may ( and at present appear to ) disrupt these programs , leading to ine ﬃ cient enucleation . Keerthivasan et al . discuss novel insights into the critical mechanisms of terminal maturation of a red blood cell and strategies to improve the e ﬃ ciency of these processes . As represented by all the information , data , and in fact vision contained in this issue , we are clearly at the beginning of a rapidly expanding ﬁeld . The papers herein provide a broad and comprehensive overview of the most relevant areas of research which have been pursued and are needed to advance the ﬁeld . Still , as state of the art as this issue is presently , the ﬁeld is moving so rapidly that one may predict that new knowledge will rapidly follow .

The primary focus of national blood programs is the provision of a safe and adequate blood supply . This goal is dependent on regular voluntary donations and a regulatory infrastructure that establishes and enforces standards for blood safety . Progress in ex vivo expansion of blood cells from cell sources including peripheral blood , cord blood , induced pluripotent stem cells , and human embryonic stem cell lines will likely make alternative transfusion products available for clinical use in the near future . Initially , alloimmunized patients and individuals with rare blood types are most likely to beneﬁt from alternative products . However , in developed nations voluntary blood donations are projected to be inadequate in the future as blood usage by individuals 60 years and older increases . In developing nations economic and political challenges may impede progress in attaining self - su ﬃ ciency . Under these circumstances , ex vivo generated red cells may be needed to supplement the general blood supply . 1 . Introduction In the last 30 years , transfusion medicine has evolved from a ﬁeld focused on blood component therapy and red blood cell serology to include advanced cellular therapies produced by ex vivo expansion [ 1 , 2 ] . The broadest applications of cellular therapies to date have been in the area of regenerative medicine and have involved ex vivo cultured ﬁbroblasts , ke - ratinocytes , and chondrocytes ( reviewed in [ 3 ] ) , but sub - stantial progress has also occurred with cellular therapies involving lymphoid and hematopoietic cells . Infusions of donor lymphoid cells to enhance engraftment following allogeneic stem cell transplantation is a common practice [ 4 ] , and progress has occurred in the development of adoptive T - cell therapies and cellular vaccines [ 5 , 6 ] . Sipuleucel - T , an autologous cancer vaccine prepared from peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) that have been activated and expanded ex vivo with a recombinant fusion protein con - sisting of prostatic acid phosphatase fused to granulo - cyte - macrophage colony - stimulating factor ( GM - CSF ) , has been licensed for treatment of castration - resistant prostate cancer [ 6 , 7 ] . Experimental therapies using ex vivo expanded cells are also being evaluated to improve the results of umbilical cord blood transplantation in adults [ 8 , 9 ] . Infusion of notch - mediated ex vivo expanded cord blood progenitors shortens the time to neutrophil recovery [ 8 ] and infusion of ex vivo expanded T regulatory cells appeared to decrease the severity of acute graft versus host disease [ 9 ] . Substantial progress has also occurred in developing culture systems for ex vivo generation of red blood cells [ 10 – 17 ] . The cell sources under evaluation include peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) , CD 34 pos mobilized cells , cord blood ( CB ) , induced pluripotent stem cells ( iPSCs ) and human embry - onic stem cell ( hESC ) lines [ 10 – 16 ] ( Table 1 ) . The United States Department of Defense is supporting research focused on ex vivo generation of red blood cells from cord blood on an industrial scale . Arteriocyte , a bio - technology company in Cleveland , Ohio , with a coalition of academic and industrial scientists supported in part by research funding from the United States Department of Defense recently provided red cells generated from cord blood to the United States Food and Drug Administration 2 Stem Cells International Table 1 : Cell sources for ex vivo generation of red blood cells ∗ .

( US FDA ) for evaluation [ ABC newsletter July 23 , 2010 ] . On March 8 , 2011 , Cellectis , a French biotechnology company , announced StemRed a joint venture with Etablissement Francais du Sang that will develop red cells ex vivo from induced pluripotent stem ( iPS ) cells [ http : / / www . dailymar - kets . com / stock / 2011 / 03 / 08 / cellectis - and - the - etablissement - francais - du - sang - launch - stemred - a - program - to - produce - red - blood - cells - from - stem - cells / % 5d . ] . These e ﬀ orts to pro - duce red blood cells in vitro using existing biotechnologies recently led to the ﬁrst - in - man injection of ex vivo generated red cells in an autologous situation [ 17 ] . Scientists studying ex vivo production of platelets have refocused on animal models to clarify the optimal cell prod - uct for transfusion , that is , megakaryocytes or mature platelets [ 18 ] while e ﬀ orts continue to improve ex vivo platelet production from umbilical cord blood hematopoi - etic progenitors using immobilized glycosaminoglycans to enhance megakaryocyte progenitor expansion and platelet release from CD41a pos megakaryocyte progenitors in vitro by inhibiting megakaryocyte apoptosis [ 19 ] . E ﬀ orts to generate neutrophils are also continuing , perhaps encouraged in part by clinical trials to determine if larger doses of granulocytes collected by apheresis from donors stimulated with dexamethasone and granulocyte colony stimulating factor ( G - CSF ) would improve clinical outcomes in neutropenic patients with sepsis [ 20 – 22 ] . In this regard it is important to note that a Phase I / II trial sponsored by Cellerant Therapeutics and the Department of Health and Human Services is evaluating the safety , tolerability , and activity of ex vivo expanded human myeloid progenitor cells ( CLT - 008 ) administered after up to 5 days of “standard of care” cytarabine - based consolida - tion chemotherapy in acute lymphoblastic leukemia , acute myeloid leukemia , and high - risk myelodysplasia [ http : / / clin - icaltrials . gov / ct2 / show / NCT01297543 ] . Given the enormous e ﬀ ort currently focused on ex vivo expansion of blood cells in general and the progress in ex vivo expansion of red blood cells in particular , the potential clinical beneﬁts to be derived from such alternative products should be considered . 2 . Materials and Methods The authors conducted searches on PubMed and Google using the following search terms : adverse reactions , allergic transfusion reactions , alloimmunization , blood group anti - gens , blood safety , blood supply , blood collection , blood donors , blood transfusion , developing countries , developed countries , emerging diseases , HLA antigens , hemovigilance , history of blood transfusion , neutrophil - speciﬁc antigens , platelet - speciﬁc antigens , transfusion medicine , transfusion medicine research , clinical trials , transfusion related acute lung injury , and transfusion - transmitted infections . In ad - dition the following websites were consulted : European Medicines Association ( EMEA ) , World Health Organization , United States Department of Health and Human Services Committee on Blood Safety and Availability , Centers for Blood Evaluation and Research , US FDA , Serious Hazards of Transfusion ( SHOT ) . Consensus on needs in transfusion medicine was developed by a process that involved expert opinion as presented in the scientiﬁc literature , position Stem Cells International 3 papers and statements by governmental and non - govern - mental organizations involved in areas of blood safety and availability , and discussions among the authors . 3 . Results 3 . 1 . Perspective on Needs in Transfusion Medicine . Since the beginning of modern transfusion therapy extraordinary e ﬀ orts have been required to maintain a safe and adequate blood supply [ 23 – 25 ] . Governments have acknowledged the importance of these e ﬀ orts to the overall public health by supporting the development of national blood programs and creating administrative and regulatory structures to assure the health of blood donors and the safety of blood products [ 26 – 28 ] . The goal for nations has been to attain national self - su ﬃ ciency , a target that may be unobtainable for some nations with the current economic , political , and social challenges . For more than a decade e ﬀ orts to develop national blood programs were supported by the World Health Organization ( WHO ) Global Collaboration on Blood Safety , a voluntary partnership of internationally recognized organizations with expertise in various aspects of transfusion medicine [ 29 ] . WHO emphasized ﬁve important strategies considered critical to the development of e ﬀ ective national blood programs . These were recently reiterated in a forum addressing the role of regulatory agencies [ 27 ] : ( 1 ) “establishment of well - organized , nationally coordinated blood transfusion services with legislation and e ﬀ ective mechanisms for oversight , to ensure the timely availability of safe blood and blood products for all patients requiring transfusion , ” ( 2 ) “collection of blood from voluntary non - remunerated blood donors from low risk populations , ” ( 3 ) “performing testing for ( a ) transfusion - transmissible diseases [ including HIV , hepatitis B , hepatitis C , and syphilis ] ( b ) major blood groups and ( c ) blood compatibility , ” ( 4 ) “safe and appropriate use of blood and a reduction in unnecessary transfusions , ” and ( 5 ) “quality systems covering the entire transfusion process , from donor recruitment to the follow - up of the recipients of transfusion . ” Alignment of a safe and adequate blood supply with achievement of speciﬁc WHO Millennium Development Goals ( MDGs ) assisted developing nations in establishing priorities [ 30 , 31 ] . The blood supply impacts MDG 4 reduction of the underﬁve child mortality rate by two - thirds , MDG5 reduction in the maternal mortality rate by three - quarters , MDG 6A halting and reversing the spread of HIV by assuring that younger individuals have comprehensive correct information about HIV and HIV prevention obtained at school and MDG6C decreasing death rates associated with malaria , often caused by severe anemia . The global economic crisis has required that WHO reassess priorities , and The International Society for Blood Transfusion ( ISBT ) has established the ISBT Working Party on Global Blood Safety to continue the work begun by the WHO [ 32 ] . Adverse reactions following blood transfusion that could not have been predicted based on current scientiﬁc knowledge have been a concern throughout the history of transfusion medicine [ 23 – 25 ] . Prevention of transfusion - transmitted infections [ 33 – 38 ] and characterization of human blood groups to assure transfusion of compatible blood products [ 39 – 43 ] have always been priorities , but adverse reactions following transfusion continue to occur despite scientiﬁc and technical advances and regulatory har - monization [ 44 – 50 ] . Risks posed by new and emerging infec - tions increase [ 51 – 53 ] , and evolving scientiﬁc knowledge about the immunologic and physiologic consequences of transfusion [ 54 – 59 ] make the descriptors safe and adequate moving targets . 3 . 2 . The Blood Supply . In developed nations the blood supply is adequate overall [ 60 – 62 ] , but extreme weather conditions and natural disasters such as the recent earthquake and tsunami in Japan and ﬂooding in the United States disrupt routine blood collection activities leading to temporary shortages . The WHO 2008 Blood Safety Survey , which included data from 164 nations representing 92 % of the global population , reported on 91 . 8 million donations . Forty - eight percent of donations were collected in high - income countries representing only 15 % of the world pop - ulation [ 63 ] . The accepted standard for evaluating blood availability is blood donations per 1000 - population . In this report the donation rate for high - income countries was on average 36 . 4 ( range 13 . 3 – 64 . 6 ) donations / 1000 population , but the rate was lower in middle income and low income nations : 11 . 6 ( range 1 . 65 – 36 . 2 ) / 1000 population and 2 . 8 ( range 0 . 40 – 8 . 2 ) / 1000 population on average , respectively . While there have been substantial improvements in blood safety as developing countries have implemented the WHO recommended testing for syphilis , hepatitis B , hepatitis C , and human immune deﬁciency virus ( HIV ) , some countries continue to rely on family / replacement and paid donors ( 36 % low income and 27 % middle income , resp . ) whereas high - income countries reported only 0 . 3 % of such donors . The 2009 National Blood Collection and Utilization Survey Report provided information on blood collection and utilization in the United States for 2008 [ 61 ] . The whole blood / red cell collection rate per thousand population was 85 . 8 , and 14 , 855 , 000 units of red cells were transfused for a transfusion rate of 48 . 8 units / 1000 population . Bench - marking data presented at a 2009 meeting of the Alliance of Blood Operators indicated that for 2007 / 2008 the transfusion rate was on average lower in the European Union ( 40 / 1000 on average , with rates in Germany and Denmark closer to United States ) and in Canada ( 32 / 1000 ) compared to the United States ( 48 - 49 / 1000 population ) [ 62 ] . The average transfused dose of platelets was 5 . 8 / 1000 for the US , 4 . 3 for the National Health Service Blood and Transplant , and (cid:2) 4 / 1000 for France . Plasma supplies also appear to be adequate although shortages of AB plasma and plasma from IgA - deﬁcient donors are occasionally reported to be in short supply . In 2006 , 4 , 010 , 000 units of fresh frozen and apheresis plasma were transfused in the United States with the median volume of plasma for a single episode being 300 mL . Plasma is also collected for fractionation . There is growing concern among patient advocacy groups that the amount of plasma available for fractionation to produce coagulation factor concentrate , intravenous immune globulin , and other plasma products for rare diseases will be inadequate to meet 4 Stem Cells International clinical needs . Most nations permit only non - remunerated blood and plasma collections whereas others ( including the United States ) permit remunerated as well as non - remunerated plasma donations . Patient advocacy groups are concerned that e ﬀ orts to collect needed plasma from paid donors may compromise donor standards and disrupt routine blood collections . The issue of paid plasma donation is reviewed elsewhere [ 64 ] . The Dublin Consensus Statement summarizes these concerns [ 65 ] . Recombinant products have been developed to replace some but not all therapeutic plasma proteins . Movement of source plasma and recovered plasma across borders is quite common and perhaps serves as an example of how blood reserves could be shared across borders with standardized regulatory and manufacturing standards . While these data indicate that the blood supply is adequate in developed countries at the present time , there is growing concern that in the future the blood supply may become inadequate [ 66 – 74 ] . Several factors are responsible for these concerns . Firstly , the number of conditions for which donors are temporarily or permanently deferred is increasing [ 48 , 51 – 53 , 64 , 66 ] . Globalization and emerging infections are implicated in many of these deferrals [ 33 ] . A study that estimated donor eligibility in the US population using 31 exclusionary factors corresponding to AABB standards concluded that conventional methods overestimate eligible donor preva - lence by approximately 59 % [ 67 ] . In addition the aging of the population is expected to impact blood availability by increasing blood usage [ 68 – 73 ] . The world population , currently estimated at 6 . 8 billion , is projected to reach 7 billion in 2012 and surpass 9 billion by 2050 [ 74 ] . Most of the population increase ( 2 . 3 billion ) will occur in developing countries where individuals 15 – 59 years old will account for 1 . 2 billion and individuals 60 years and over will account for 1 . 1 billion of the expected increase . The population in developed countries is expected to increase from 1 . 23 billion to 1 . 28 billion . However , the worldwide population of individuals of 65 years and over is projected by the US Census bureau to increase from 7 . 7 % ( 2010 ) to 16 . 5 % in 2050 . Blood donations will also be a ﬀ ected by aging of the population [ 68 – 80 ] . The American Red Cross reported that donations by repeat donors 50 years or older increased from 22 . 1 % of total donations in 1996 to 34 . 5 % of total donations in 2005 [ 80 ] . During the same period a decrease in the numbers of male and female donors between 20 and 49 years of age was observed . Data from Germany reﬂects similar donation patterns in that repeat donors are more likely to belong to older age groups ( 35 – 44 years and 45 – 54 years ) [ 70 , 71 ] . The issue of an aging donor base has been resolved in part by countries such as the United States , the United Kingdom , and Australia by eliminating the upper age limit of 70 and allowing younger donors ( 16 years ) to donate with parental permission [ 75 – 79 ] . The Club 25 concept originally developed in Zimbabwe [ 79 ] is being adapted for use in developed countries . Despite these e ﬀ orts , increased blood usage by older populations remains an issue . Most transfusions in older individuals are related to diagnoses of cardiovascular disease , cancer , and the need for orthopedic surgery [ 68 , 69 ] . Investigators from the Finnish Red Cross observed that many developed nations had similar age - standardized mortality rates for cancer , cardiovascular disease , injuries , and noncommunicable disease , and using these data simulated red cell usage per 1000 population between 2010 and 2050 for several developed countries based on age - distributed variation in blood usage in Finland between 2002 and 2006 [ 72 ] . The simulation predicted substantial increases in blood usage in developed countries associated with a decrease in the size of the population eligible to donate . Earlier studies had predicted a shortfall in blood collections in the United States [ 68 ] . Independent assessments using alternative data sources conﬁrm the projected increase in demand for blood caused by increases in the population of individuals over 60 years of age [ 71 , 73 ] . 3 . 3 . Prevention of Transfusion - Transmitted Infections : Global Perspective . Progress in preventing transfusion - transmitted infections was recently reviewed [ 35 ] Implementation of restrictive donor eligibility criteria and use of volunteer non - remunerated donors , along with speciﬁc testing for syphilis and hepatitis B , hepatitis C , HIV1 / 2 , and HTLV1 / 2 , are critical steps in assuring blood safety . In developing countries recruitment of volunteer non - remunerated donors is impacted by cultural deﬁnitions of community [ 81 – 83 ] instead of geographic proximity . As a result , e ﬀ orts to recruit volunteer donors in some nations have been ine ﬀ ective . Research conducted on the impact on blood safety of converting family / replacement donors to allogeneic donors in South Africa has demonstrated that when such donors are repeat donors , the blood provided is safer than ﬁrst - time volunteer donors [ 84 – 86 ] . These observations are consistent with previous studies in developed countries indicating a lower risk of infection for repeat donors and should encourage more innovative approaches for donor recruitment in Sub - Saharan Africa . The most recent published data from the American Red Cross ( using NAT testing ) indicate that the residual risk per donated unit is 1 : 1 , 149 , 000 for HCV , 1 : 357 , 000 to 1 : 280 , 000 for HBV , and 1 : 1 , 467 , 000 for HIV [ 36 ] . By con - trast , the estimated residual risk of transfusion - transmitted HIV in a multinational collaborative study involving ﬁve nations in Sub - Saharan Africa which used either an antibody assay or combined p 24antigen / antibody assays reported a residual risk for HIV of 34 . 1 per 1 million donations which represents 1 in 29 , 000 donations [ 86 ] . In addition to these traditional transfusion transmissible diseases for which all donor blood should be tested , donors are also screened for other diseases based on the geographic location , such as for malaria ( either by history or using antibody tests [ 87 , 88 ] ) and for local viral and parasitic diseases such as Chagas’ disease [ 89 , 90 ] , dengue [ 91 , 92 ] , West Nile virus , [ 93 – 95 ] and chikungunya [ 96 ] . In addition , epidemic viral diseases such as H1N1 and yellow fever must also be considered . Asymptomatic healthy blood donors may also transmit common viral infections which do not cause harm to the average transfusion recipient but which may represent sig - nificant risks in selected patient populations . For example , latent cytomegalovirus infection ( CMV ) is common in Stem Cells International 5 normal donors . Depending on the geographic location and socioeconomic status of donors , 70 – 100 % of donors may be seropositive . Pregnant women , neonates , and other immu - no - compromised CMV - negative patients may develop seri - ous infectious complications due to transfusion - transmitted CMV . Currently , leukoreduced blood products and products from CMV seronegative donors are used for populations vulnerable to CMV [ 97 – 101 ] . A meta - analysis comparing leukoreduction and antibody screening as CMV prevention strategies reported that both techniques were e ﬀ ective in reducing transmission but indicated that antibody screening may be more e ﬀ ective [ 98 ] . Studies of the natural course of CMV infection in blood donors indicate that CMV DNA may persist up to 269 days following infection [ 97 , 99 ] and suggest that blood donors who have recently seroconverted be deferred for a year . Parvovirus B19 , an erythrotropic virus that uses the P blood group antigen to infect erythroid progenitors , may cause severe anemia , red cell aplasia , and congenital anoma - lies when transmitted by transfusion [ 102 – 107 ] . Neonates , pregnant women , and patients with congenital and acquired forms of hemolytic anemia are most vulnerable to this infection , but routine screening of blood donors for par - vovirus B19 is not performed . However , plasma pools for fractionation are screened for parvovirus B19 because cur - rent fractionation / inactivation techniques do not completely inactivate the virus and transmission of parvovirus by coag - ulation factor concentrate is well documented . Although the risk of transmission of parvovirus B19 appears low in transfusion recipients because of preexisting protective antibody from past natural infections in many transfusion recipients and blood donors , transmission of parvovirus B19 by transfusion has been recently documented [ 103 – 105 ] . Data from the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute Retrovirus Epidemiology Donor Study - II which tested pre - and posttransfusion samples found no transmission to 24 susceptible recipients from transfusion of components with parvovirus B19 DNA containing less than 10 6 IU / mL [ 102 ] . Data from the Japanese Red Cross hemovigilance system pro - vide an alternative perspective which suggests that specially screened products may be needed for selected populations [ 104 ] . Between 1999 and 2008 , when parvovirus B19 donor screening was conducted using a cuto ﬀ similar to that of the REDS study , eight patients with transfusion transmitted parvovirus B19 DNA were identiﬁed and sequence identity between patient and the linked donor was conﬁrmed in 5 cases . Red cell aplasia developed in 3 of the 5 conﬁrmed cases . This report suggests that alternative blood products with lower risk of parvovirus B19 infection should be provided for at - risk patient populations . 3 . 4 . Alloimmunization . As the scientiﬁc basis for producing better and safer products for transfusion through donor screening and product testing has made transfusion safer , alloimmunization resulting from transfusion has emerged as a major issue in clinical care . The magnitude of this problem led to a recent NHLBI sponsored conference to identify areas in which additional research was needed to better understand factors contributing to alloimmunization as well as research on prevention and management of alloimmunization [ 108 ] . Alloimmunization in females may result from exposure to paternal antigens during pregnancy . In the general popu - lation alloimmunization occurs following transfusion , solid organ or tissue transplantation , or following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with partially matched donors . Blood contains many cells and proteins expressing poly - morphic antigen systems that may lead to alloimmunization . Erythrocytes alone may express antigens from 30 blood group systems for which over 300 di ﬀ erent antigens have been identiﬁed [ 40 – 43 , 109 – 112 ] . Small numbers of residual red cells and leukocytes may contaminate plasma and platelet products causing alloimmunization ( anti - D developing fol - lowing transfusion of Rh positive plasma to Rh negative indi - viduals or anti - HLA following platelet transfusion ) . Typically blood products are matched for ABO group and Rh ( D ) only unless patients are alloimmunized . Once alloimmunization occurs subsequent transfusions must be matched unless the antibody is considered clinically insigniﬁcant [ 112 ] . It is estimated that 1 – 3 % of the general population is immunized to blood group antigens . Alloimmunization is more common in chronically trans - fused patients such as patients with hemoglobinopathies or transfusion - dependent myelodysplasia [ 113 – 116 ] . Alloim - munization also occurs more often in communities where blood donors and blood recipients are from di ﬀ erent ethnic groups [ 112 ] . Investigators observed that the rate of alloim - munization in sickle cell disease ( SCD ) patients in Jamaica where more blood donors were of African ancestry was lower than the alloimmunization rate of SCD patients in the UK where most blood donors were caucasian . Historically , twenty - to thirty - ﬁve percent of chronically transfused patients with sickle cell disease or thalassemia are immunized to blood group antigens [ 113 – 116 ] . When these patients experience a hemolytic transfusion reaction , autoantibodies as well as alloantibodies to transfused cells may be produced , causing a syndrome referred to as hyperhemolysis [ 117 – 121 ] . Limited matching strategies such as matching for Kell , Rh ( Cc , D , E , e ) , Fy , and Jk have reduced overall alloimmuniza - tion rates in most chronically transfused patient populations [ 113 , 114 ] but have led to alloimmunization to variant blood group antigen di ﬀ erences which testing with serological reagents does not identify [ 122 – 125 ] . For example , in the Blue Tag program at Children’s Hospital in Philadelphia , established to identify African - American donors antigen - matched for African American patients with SCD , alloimmu - nization to other more subtle antigen di ﬀ erences such as D - deletion variants developed requiring more precise matching with DNA - based technology [ 122 ] . Similar observations have been made in other sickle cell patient populations [ 123 ] . Patients with myelodysplasia and myeloproliferative neoplasms may also require chronic transfusion support and become alloimmunized . DNA - based methods are now being used to screen large numbers of blood donors to identify compatible blood for alloimmunized patients [ 126 – 137 ] . In the United States , these methods are not FDA approved and phenotypes are conﬁrmed with serological reagents . While most of this work is occurring at blood centers , a recent study suggests that transfusion service laboratories 6 Stem Cells International may be able to identify some units in their existing inventory [ 138 ] . Identifying matched blood for patients alloimmunized to multiple blood group antigens and patients with rare blood types ( variably deﬁned as 1 / 1000 or 1 / 10 , 000 or fewer compatible donors ) is a challenge . Although reference laboratories around the world cooperate in this e ﬀ ort [ 132 ] , blood for such patients is often in short supply . Blood centers are now using information about rare blood types and the populations most likely to contain compatible donors to develop strategies to recruit such donors . For example , Life Share Blood Centers ( Louisiana , USA ) has published on its website statistics about the ethnicity of donors testing negative for the blood group antigens S , s , and U ( a high - incidence antigen ) , a phenotype more common in African - Americans than Caucasians . Publication of this data has increased minority participation in blood donation . New York Blood Center has a similar program to recruit donors called Precise - Match , tailored for outreach to the various ethnic groups in New York City . Platelets express A and B blood group antigens , class I HLA - A and HLA - B locus antigens ( HLA - C locus antigens are not expressed well on platelets ) , and platelet - speciﬁc antigens 27 of which are well characterized [ 139 – 141 ] . Antibodies to HLA - A and HLA - B locus antigens are most often implicated in platelet refractoriness , but antibodies to platelet - speciﬁc antigens are also implicated [ 142 , 143 ] . Neonatal thrombocytopenia usually involves platelet - speciﬁc antigens ( PLA 1 – 17 ) , but several cases implicating antibodies to HLA antigens have been described . Class I and or class II HLA antigens are also expressed on various lymphocyte and monocyte populations , and granulocytes express unique polymorphic antigens [ 144 , 145 ] . Plasma proteins also express polymorphisms , but serious transfusion reactions have been documented most often in IgA - deﬁcient and haptoglobin - deﬁcient individuals who develop class - speciﬁc antibodies to IgA and haptoglobin , respectively [ 146 , 147 ] . Immunization to HLA antigens a ﬀ ects not only survival of transfused platelets but also prevents engraftment of hematopoietic stem cells and may lead to allograft rejection of solid organs as well as hematopoietic stem cells . Until recently only alloimmunization of transfusion recipients was thought to be a problem , but recently alloantibodies to HLA and granulocyte antigens in donor plasma ( and apheresis platelets ) have been documented to be the cause of transfusion - related acute lung injury ( TRALI ) [ 140 , 148 ] . Because women are more likely to be alloimmunized , TRALI mitigation strategies include use of male donors , identiﬁ - cation of never pregnant female donors , and identiﬁcation of female donors testing negative for anti - HLA antibodies . Implementation of this strategy has substantially reduced morbidity and mortality from TRALI in developed countries but has once again reduced the numbers of individuals available to donate certain blood components . Platelet transfusions have steadily increased over the past eight years in developed countries . Transfusion of ABO identical platelet products is preferred , but such products are not always available . Platelet recovery in ABO - incompatible transfusions may be slightly lower , but platelet survival is normal . However , transfusion of ABO - nonidentical platelets has caused serious hemolytic transfusion reactions in some patients because of high - titer anti - A and anti - B in donor plasma [ 149 – 153 ] . While hospitals have policies to manage such transfusions , blood centers have not routinely per - formed anti - A and anti - B titers to identify high - risk group O donors . In Europe , blood centers are testing products and restricting use to group O recipients ( reviewed in [ 154 ] ) . The use of platelet additive solutions on a large scale could also lower the risk of hemolysis because such products contain less plasma . A recent publication reported that de novo HLA allosensitization in patients on ventricular assist devices is lower when patients receive leukoreduced ABO identical products , suggesting that even small amounts of hemolysis might facilitate alloimmunization to HLA [ 151 ] . Thus matching both for ABO and HLA may be important in providing transfusion support for highly alloimmunized patients [ 155 ] . Refractoriness to platelet transfusion is usually caused by alloimmunization to HLA antigens [ 142 , 143 , 155 , 156 ] . The TRAP study , a large randomized clinical trial designed to compare leukoreduction and UVB irradiation in preventing refractoriness to platelet transfusions related to alloimmu - nization to HLA antigens , reported that 45 % of AML patients receiving control platelets but only 18 % of patients receiving leukoreduced and 21 % of patients receiving UVB - treated platelets were alloimmunized [ 156 ] . Following this study , leukoreduced platelet products became the standard of care even though UVB irradiation was also e ﬀ ective . Followup of patients who became alloimmunized to HLA revealed that 56 % of patients subsequently became antibody negative [ 157 ] . Since UVB irradiation and riboﬂavin are incorporated in current pathogen inactivation methods for platelets , licensed in Europe but not yet in the US , there will likely be renewed interest in this method to prevent alloim - munization [ 158 ] . However , a meta - analysis of randomized controlled trials of pathogen - reduced platelets indicates that posttransfusion - corrected count increments were lower , an observation that will a ﬀ ect dosing strategies [ 159 ] . Granulocytes play a crucial role in protecting individuals from a number of pathogens . In the early 1970s , the ﬁrst studies suggesting that granulocyte transfusions might de - crease mortality associated with bacterial infections were published [ 160 ] . However , collection of adequate numbers of granulocytes and provision of these products to patients in a timely way is a logistical challenge . The introduction of many new and more e ﬀ ective antibiotics and antifungal agents as well as the routine administration of G - CSF and GM - CSF has substantially reduced mortality from infec - tions . However , considerable mortality and morbidity still occur in neutropenic patients following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation . Clinical trials using granulocyte trans - fusions have provided mixed results [ 161 ] . Currently gran - ulocytes are collected by apheresis from prescreened donors ( often regular plateletpheresis donors ) using dexamethasone or a combination of dexamethasone and G - CSF and trans - fused as soon as possible but never more than 24 hours after collection . The logistics of collection , variable yields , and limited information on the best conditions for storage have contributed to the variable outcomes in clinical studies Stem Cells International 7 published to date . Alloimmunization to granulocyte - speciﬁc antigens appears to inhibit the function of transfused gran - ulocytes [ 160 ] . Three clinical centers have recently published retrospective analyses of their experience with granulocyte transfusions using optimal mobilization techniques and reported improved survival [ 154 , 162 , 163 ] . An NHLBI - sponsored phase III clinical trial examining the e ﬀ ectiveness of granulocyte transfusions in individuals with neutropenia and infection following dose - intensive chemotherapy or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is underway [ 164 ] . Should this trial provide support for the e ﬀ ectiveness of granulocyte transfusions , a less labor - intense and more cost - e ﬃ cient method to produce granulocytes would be desirable . 3 . 5 . The Red Cell Storage Lesion . Since the publication in 2008 by Koch et al . [ 55 ] of a retrospective study reporting increased risk of postoperative complications and reduced short - term and long - term survival in cardiac surgery pa - tients receiving blood stored for more than two weeks , there has been considerable debate about the beneﬁts of transfusing fresh versus older units of blood [ 57 , 59 , 165 ] . Biochemical changes during red cell storage in currently licensed additive solutions are well documented . However , the primary criteria for licensure are hemolysis ( below 0 . 8 % in EU and 1 % in the US ) and red cell survival not less than 75 % at the end of storage [ 165 , 166 ] . In an editorial discussing the potential clinical relevance of this low level of hemolysis on transfusion recipients , potential di ﬀ erences in the e ﬀ ects of free hemoglobin compared to hemoglobin in microvesicles are discussed referencing studies of thrombin generation by red cell supernatant [ 166 ] . It is not currently known if clinical outcomes are a ﬀ ected by the age of blood transfused . However , a retrospective cohort study of individuals in Sweden and Denmark transfused between 1995 and 2002 as recorded in the Scandinavian Donations and Transfusions ( SCANDAT ) Database which analysed 404 , 959 transfusion episodes revealed a small ( 5 % ) excess mortality for recipients of blood stored for 30 – 42 days and mixed - age compared to recipients of blood stored for 10 – 19 days [ 167 ] . The authors noted no dose response pattern or e ﬀ ect of leukoreduction and concluded that the di ﬀ erences observed were “compatible with a higher baseline risk among recipients of the very oldest units than with an actual deleterious e ﬀ ect of the oldest units . ” However , should either clinical or basic research studies provide conclusive evidence that inferior outcomes are associated with transfusion of blood stored for longer periods , the shift toward usage of fresher blood would reduce blood inventories and create signiﬁcant blood shortages . The editorial by Simone A . Glynn , MD , MPH from the Division of Blood Diseases and Resources at the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute summarizes the situation well by stating that , despite the numerous publications , there is “genuine uncertainty as to whether transfusing fresher blood is more , less , or equally beneﬁcial as transfusion of older blood” [ 59 ] . The editorial identiﬁes four large randomized clinical trials related to the age of transfused blood that are underway in North America . The Canadian Institutes of Health Research is funding two trials , one in intensive care patients randomized to receive either less than 8 - day or standard issue red blood cells ( 2 – 42 days ) in The Age of Blood Evaluation ( ABLE ) Study which has as the primary outcome 90 - day all - cause mortality and a second study in which premature infants ( ≤ 1250 g ) will be randomized to receive either less than 8 - day or 2 – 42 - day aliquots with a primary endpoint being a 90 - day composite measure of all cause mortality and organ dysfunction . The Cleveland Clinic is conducting the Red Cell Storage and Outcomes in Cardiac Surgery Trial ( NCT00458783 ) in which individuals 18 yrs and older undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass for primary and reoperative coronary artery bypass grafting , coronary artery bypass grafting with a valve procedure , and isolated valve procedures are randomized to receive blood transfusion with storage duration less than 14 days or greater than 20 days . NHLBI is also sponsoring through the Transfusion Medicine Clinical Trials Group the Red Cell Storage and Duration Study ( RECESS ) —NCT00991341 in which individuals 12 years or older undergoing complex car - diac surgery and likely to need transfusion are randomized to receive blood ≤ 10 days storage duration or ≥ 21 days storage duration . The primary outcome is the change in the composite multiple organ dysfunction score ( MODS ) . Dr . Glynn also identiﬁed research projects funded under the NHLBI program “Immunomodulatory , Inﬂammatory , and Vasoregulatory Properties of Transfused Red Blood Cell Units as a Function of Preparation and Storage” designed to provide information on mechanisms via which transfusion of older blood might lead to adverse physiological outcomes and to design interventions to eliminate them . Current data are inadequate to determine if transfusion of older units of blood is associated with either short - or long - term adverse outcomes . Basic research in animal models and prospective randomized clinical trials are needed in this area . 3 . 6 . Impact of Ex Vivo Generated Blood Cells on Needs in Transfusion Medicine . Red blood cells have been successfully generated ex vivo from peripheral blood mononuclear cells , cord blood , and human - induced pluripotent stem cell ( hiPSC ) and human embryonic stem cell ( hESC ) lines . The expansion potential of cord blood and peripheral blood is limited , but that of hiPSC and hESC is inﬁnite . Multiple products from a single collection ( blood or skin ﬁbroblasts ) would be generated from well - characterized donors under GMP conditions . Irrespective of the cell source , the donor will be selected to be negative for known transmissible diseases and will represent either a rare phenotype ( 1 / 1000 or ≤ 1 / 10 , 000 ) or a phenotype much in demand ( O Rh negative or O Rh positive ) . The primary product will be almost devoid of other contaminating blood cells and suspended in deﬁned media designed to support viability and cell function but lacking immunoglobulins and other plasma components which precipitate TRALI and allergic transfusion reactions ( IgA , haptoglobin ) . Theoretically , the equivalent of 10 – 50 therapeutic units of blood ( 2 × 10 12 cells ) can be generated from a single cord blood unit . The development of cord blood banks for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has created an infrastructure that facilitates collection of cord blood for other uses ( i . e . , endothelial cells for regenerative 8 Stem Cells International medicine ) [ 168 ] . Cord blood can also be cryopreserved for up to 23 years with recovery of adequate numbers of hematopoietic progenitors and the ability to generate iPS [ 169 ] . Although the expansion potential of peripheral blood is considered to be lower than that of cord blood , at present peripheral blood is more readily obtained because it is a byproduct of leukoreduction . The ﬁrst in - man transfusion is likely to be from one of these two cell sources with studies of red cells generated from hESC or hiPSC coming later [ 170 – 172 ] . Currently 1200 hESC lines have been established worldwide , and 375 of these are deposited in two international registries [ 172 ] . Investigators at the forefront of ex vivo expansion studies expect that GMP compliant facilities to produce red cells ex vivo will be available within the next 2 - 3 years . Location of manufacturing facilities will be critical given the complexity of the manufacturing process and the need for reliable transport . The potential impact of such products on blood manufacturing operations is substantial . The ﬁrst clinical use of ex vivo generated red cells is likely to be for highly alloimmunized patients and for patients with rare blood types [ 170 , 171 ] . Theoretical calculations to determine how many iPSC lines would be needed to support alloimmunized patients in France have already been per - formed [ 171 ] . Although a large number of embryonic stem cell lines have been developed , the expression of blood group antigens by erythrocytes from these cell lines is not known [ 172 ] . Forty percent of rare units in France were provided to patients with sickle cell anemia [ 171 ] . Data from WHO sug - gests that worldwide patients with hemoglobinopathies are represented among patients requiring chronic transfusion . Hemoglobinopathies occur in over 332 , 000 conceptions or births annually and account for 3 . 4 % of under - 5 mortality [ 173 , 174 ] . Worldwide an estimated 275 , 000 have a sickle cell disorder and 56 , 000 a major thalassaemia , approximately 30 , 000 of which will require chronic transfusion to sur - vive . In the WHO America region , 52 . 4 % of transfusion - dependent patients receive transfusions , but in the Eastern Mediterranean region and South - East Asian region , which have a higher number of transfusion - dependent patients , 17 . 8 % and 9 . 6 % , respectively , of transfusion - dependent patients received transfusions [ 174 ] . These data suggest that , as healthcare improves in developing nations , the number of patients with hemoglobinopathies requiring transfusions will increase and these individuals will likely need special antigen - matched products . Once manufacturing facilities are established for ex vivo generation of red cells , the general inventory of blood in both developing and developed countries could be increased by ex vivo generation of red cells . Theoretically , if peripheral blood mononucleated cells ( PBMCs ) from each whole blood donation were to be expanded ex vivo , each donation would produce not only one but possibly 3 – 10 or more units of blood . This would allow blood donors to donate less often , decrease concerns about iron deﬁciency , and reduce costs for donor recruitment . PBMC generated by leukoreduction during the manufacturing process for red cells are the easiest product to obtain . The least expensive way to prepare leukoreduced products is the bu ﬀ y coat method , but recovery of PBMC from in - line or sterile docked ﬁlters is also possible . In 2006 , prestorage leukoreduction was performed on approximately 11 . 3 million units of red blood cells in the United States . Currently , cord blood units are being collected as a source of hematopoietic progenitor cells for transplantation , but cord blood contains other cell populations that have value in regenerative medicine such as na¨ıve immune cells , mesenchymal cells , and endothelial progenitor cells . Accurate ﬁgures for donations to public banks are available . Donation rates to public banks vary from 0 . 1 % of births to 0 . 34 % of births [ 168 ] . Some families choose to bank cord blood for autologous / family use , and these units are not available for ex vivo generation of blood cells . Overall , these data indicate that a potentially vast but untapped resource is available for ex vivo generation of blood cells . At present there is no data to suggest that ex vivo products are needed in developed nations for the general inventory but should projections about increased blood usage in individuals age 60 years and older be correct such products may be needed in the future . The supply of safe blood in developing countries has improved in recent years but is still inadequate . Anemia related to trauma , pregnancy , or malaria is the most common indication for transfusion , and currently blood is not always available when needed . It is unrealistic to propose that a country that cannot e ﬀ ectively run a national blood program would have the resources to expand blood cells ex vivo . However , a manufactured blood product produced elsewhere could be imported . Manufactured products are more uni - form because methods and product speciﬁcations can be standardized with quality monitoring implemented to assure that such standards are met . Under these circumstances , cellular products might move freely across national borders as is the case with some pharmaceuticals . Alternatively , one might maintain the current not - for - proﬁt business model for whole blood collection and model ex vivo expansion on a for - proﬁt model where economies of scale might work to reduce overall cost . Progress in ex vivo generation of megakaryocytes and platelets is not as advanced as development of red cells . The value of platelet transfusions in preventing hemorrhage in thrombocytopenic patients and patients with throm - bocythemia is not disputed although the level at which platelet transfusions should be given prophylactically to thrombocytopenic patients to prevent hemorrhage was the subject of recent clinical trials . Platelets may be manu - factured from whole blood by centrifugation to produce platelet concentrate or prepared by apheresis . An adult dose of platelets would require pooling of 4 – 6 units of platelets depending on local practice or a single apheresis product . Both products are usually leukoreduced . There is ongoing concern about the adequacy of platelet inventories for two reasons , the shelf life is short ( maximum of 5 days ) and platelet products stored at room temperature are more likely to be contaminated with bacteria [ 37 , 38 ] . Refractoriness to platelet transfusions is usually caused by anti - HLA antibodies . Antibodies to platelet - speciﬁc antigens may also be implicated . In neonatal thrombocytopenic purpura , the o ﬀ ending antibody is typically directed at Stem Cells International 9 platelet - speciﬁc antigens . Refractoriness to platelet transfu - sions is a signiﬁcant problem for multitransfused patients with hematologic malignancies receiving chemotherapy or undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation . Iden - tiﬁcation of suitable products for alloimmunized patients involves HLA typing of the patient ( typically performed with DNA - based techniques ) , antibody screening for anti - HLA class I and anti - platelet - speciﬁc antibodies ( solid phase or ﬂow cytometry ) as well as platelet crossmatching ( solid phase or ﬂow cytometric techniques ) . Complex computer algorithms for selecting HLA compatible donors based on epitope sharing have been developed to identify compatible products [ 142 , 143 ] . Thus the ability to generate platelet products ex vivo and platelet products lacking HLA antigens in serum free media would have great clinical value . Methods have been developed to generate platelets ex vivo from cord blood CD34 positive cells and from embryonic stem cells [ 175 ] . Ex vivo generation of platelet products deﬁcient in HLA class I antigen expression could have an enormous impact on the provision of platelet products to refrac - tory patients . Using an RNA - interference - based mechanism ( RNAi ) in which a lentiviral vector was used to express short - hairpin RNA targeting β 2 - microglobulin transcripts in CD34 positive cells , Figueiredo et al . generated platelets demonstrating an 85 % reduction in class I HLA antigens compared with platelets generated in CD34 positive cells transduced with a lentiviral vector containing a nonsense shRNA [ 175 ] . These platelets appeared to have normal func - tion in vitro . Alternatively , hESC or hiPSC could be used to generate products for highly immunized patients . Granulocyte transfusions have not consistently demon - strated improved clinical outcomes in infected neutropenic patients . However , these inconsistent results may reﬂect heterogeneity in patient populations , failure to transfuse an adequate number of granulocytes , limited information on optimal storage conditions for granulocyte products , and di ﬃ culty in identifying a rapid reliable assay for determin - ing granulocyte compatibility ( other than ABO ) . Studies of ex vivo generated neutrophils may provide valuable infor - mation on optimal storage conditions for neutrophils and may ultimately produce a product with a longer shelf - life . Theoretically , ex vivo generated red blood cells will be produced on demand on a predictable schedule , will provide cellular products of more uniform composition with limited contamination by other cell types , will be associated with lower rates of transmission of infectious diseases , cause fewer allergic reactions , produce a lower rate of alloimmunization because extended matching will be possible , and will have longer in vivo survival while producing less iron overload than currently available products . It is not possible to predict when these products will be approved for clinical use . Many complex issues related to scale - up production and the poten - tial immunogenicity ( neoantigen formation ) of products produced in vitro remain to be resolved . However , the development of these products will inform and transform quality control and manufacturing processes for traditional blood products .

Because of the imbalance in the supply and demand of red blood cells ( RBCs ) , especially for alloimmunized patients or patients with rare blood phenotypes , extensive research has been done to generate therapeutic quantities of mature RBCs from hematopoietic stem cells of various sources , such as bone marrow , peripheral blood , and cord blood . Since human embryonic stem cells ( hESCs ) and induced pluripotent stem cells ( iPSCs ) can be maintained indeﬁnitely in vitro , they represent potentially inexhaustible sources of donor - free RBCs . In contrast to other ex vivo stem - cell - derived cellular therapeutics , tumorigenesis is not a concern , as RBCs can be irradiated without marked adverse e ﬀ ects on in vivo function . Here , we provide a comprehensive review of the recent publications relevant to the generation and characterization of hESC - and iPSC - derived erythroid cells and discuss challenges to be met before the eventual realization of clinical usage of these cells . 1 . Introduction Medical progress , speciﬁcally in the ﬁelds of hematol - ogy / oncology and transplantation surgery , as well as an over - all aging population , has led to an ever - increasing demand for erythrocytes for transfusion to currently approximately ﬁfty thousand RBC concentrates per million population per year in countries with a high standard of health care . Currently , the exclusive source for these is volunteer donors , who obviously are subject to the same societal changes as the recipients , that is , they are aging also . Recruitment of new donors from the shrinking pool of eligible individuals is challenging and additionally hampered by ever - increasing restrictions , predominantly recipient - directed exclusion cri - teria for donors . Perceived lack of safety of blood products also is a highly sensitive issue in the population , particularly since the emergence of HIV in the eighties , as a consequence of which a whole generation of hemophilia patients was infected . The desire to counter these challenges has led to the extensive e ﬀ ort in the generation of red blood cells ( RBCs ) in vitro from a variety of sources , such as bone marrow , peripheral blood , and cord blood . More recently , utilizing embryonic stem cells ( hESCs ) and induced pluripotent stem cells ( iPSCs ) to generate universal donor RBCs has been envisioned [ 1 , 2 ] . hESCs are pluripotent stem cells derived from the inner cell mass of the blastocyst [ 3 ] , and iPSCs are ESC - like cells generated by reprogramming somatic cells , most often via forced expression of a combination of transcription factors , such as Oct3 / 4 , Nanog , KLF4 , c - Myc , LIN28 , and SOX2 [ 4 , 5 ] . Both hESCs and hiPSCs can be maintained indeﬁnitely in culture and can be induced to undergo di ﬀ erentiation to give rise to any cell types of all three germ layers . These characteristics made them not only a valuable tool for the study of developmental biology , but also a potential source for providing unlimited numbers of cells for cell replacement 2 Stem Cells International therapies . While our laboratory has previously shown that the then existing hESC lines are not conducive to culturing universal donor RBCs [ 6 ] , many additional hESC lines have been generated ever since . Furthermore , the recent advances in hiPSCs have partially obviated this obstacle , as exempliﬁed by the generation of hiPSCs from a Bombay individual whose RBCs lack ABH antigens expression due to the absence of the H gene ( FUT1 - ) and Secretor gene ( FUT2 - ) encoded α 1 , 2 fucosyltransferase activities [ 7 ] . It has been proposed by French researchers that based on their database , as few as 15 hiPSC clones would cover 100 % of the needs of all Caucasian patients with rare blood phenotypes / genotypes in France [ 2 ] . In addition , they suggested that one single hiPSC clone would meet 73 % of the needs in alloimmunized patients with sickle cell disease for whom rare cryopreserved RBC units are required [ 2 ] . In this review , we summarize the recent development in the in vitro generation and characterization of erythroid cells from either hESCs or iPSCs and point out areas of further investigation needed before their use for clinical purposes . 2 . Methods for the Generation of Erythroid Cells from hESCs and iPSCs hESCs and hiPSCs represent renewable , potentially unlim - ited cell sources , in contrast to the hematopoietic stem cells originating from bone marrow , cord blood , or peripheral blood , that require donors to be constantly secured , for the ex vivo generation of RBCs . The potential charm of autologous hiPSCs in the context of erythrocyte generation is the identical genetic identity between the cells and the recipient for all blood group antigens , since the prevalent clinical problem is the polysensitization against foreign erythrocyte antigens , and these patients are at risk for acquisition of additional antibodies . Several laboratories have established protocols to derive erythroid cells from the hESCs and hiPSCs . While each protocol varies in technical details , they can generally be divided into two main categories : those that coculture stem cells with stromal layers to induce hematopoietic di ﬀ erentiation , and those that culture stem cells in suspension to form embryoid bodies ( EBs ) ( Table 1 ) . One exception is a recent report by Salvagiotto and colleagues who circumvent EBs and stromal coculture by utilizing a matrix protein to generate a 2 - dimentioinal culture system to support the generation of hematopoietic cells from hESCs and hiPSCs [ 25 ] . 2 . 1 . Stromal Coculture . Several types of stromal layers have been reported in the coculture system , including murine bone marrow ( BM ) cell line S17 [ 9 , 26 ] and OP9 [ 8 , 10 , 27 ] , the yolk sac endothelial cell line C166 [ 9 ] , murine fetal liver - derived stromal line ( mFLSC ) [ 12 , 13 ] , murine aorta - gonad - mesonephros ( AGM ) stromal lines [ 12 ] , primary murine stromal cells from AGM and FL [ 12 ] , immortalized human fetal liver hepatocyte line FH - B - hTERT [ 1 , 14 , 15 ] , and primary human stromal cells derived from aorta - AGM , FL , and fetal BM ( FBM ) [ 11 ] . A side - by - side comparison ﬁnds that FH - B - hTERT cells are more e ﬀ ective than S17 cells in stimulating CD34 + cells generation from hESCs [ 14 ] . The direct contact with stromal layers increases hematopoietic di ﬀ erentiation e ﬃ ciency [ 11 , 12 , 26 ] , although it is not an absolute requirement [ 11 , 26 ] . In general , when culture media are supplemented with fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) , no additional growth factors are required during coculture [ 1 , 9 , 12 , 14 , 15 , 26 ] . To generate large quantities of relatively pure erythroid cells , often a further puriﬁcation of CD34 + cells from the coculture population is performed prior to seeding them in media supplemented with growth factors for erythroid expansion [ 1 , 8 ] , or the mixture of coculture cells is placed in methylcellulose cultures for hematopoietic colony assays , and then individual erythroid colonies are extracted from semisolid culture for further analysis [ 13 ] . While these studies have provided important insights into the erythroid development from hESCs or hiPSCs and have the potential for large - scale production [ 1 , 8 , 13 ] , the utilization of murine cells in coculture by some protocols may make them unsuitable for clinical applications in the future . 2 . 2 . EB Formation . Alternatively , successful hematopoietic induction can be achieved by EB formation , usually by plac - ing clumps of hESCs or hiPSCs in nontissue culture - treated plates , or ultralow attachment plates . It has been reported in mouse EBs that cells undergo self - organization to establish anteroposterior polarity and form a primitive streak - like region via the Wnt signaling pathway [ 28 ] . For robust hematopoietic di ﬀ erentiation , good quality EB formation is essential . While Lu et al . observe that it is essential to use high - quality hESCs with minimal signs of di ﬀ erentiation and uniform stem cell marker expression for EBs formation and for high - e ﬃ ciency erythroid generation [ 22 ] , Ungrin and colleagues ﬁnd that aggregates formed from populations of cells with the highest levels of Oct4 actually exhibit the least stability in terms of EB formation [ 29 ] . We ﬁnd that hESCs or hiPSCs cultured under murine embryonic ﬁbroblast ( MEF ) feeder - free conditions on matrigel - coated plates with MEF - conditioned media or a chemically deﬁned media , such as mTeSR ( StemCell Technologies ) , can also be used for EB formation , although they tend to be more temperamental with less consistent EB formation for unknown reasons ( unpublished data ) . EB formation can be further controlled by plating a deﬁned number of cells in untreated U bottom or V bottom , 96 - or 386 - well plates , or AggreWells and forcing the formation of aggregates by centrifugation [ 30 , 31 ] . Because the forced aggregation of a deﬁned number of hESCs or hiPSCs requires the generation of single cell suspensions prior to aggregation , we ﬁnd that the addition of p160 - Rho - associated coiled coil kinase ( ROCK ) inhibitor Y - 27632 before and during the ﬁrst 24 hours of EB formation is essential for the survival of these stem cells , consistent with previous reports [ 29 , 32 ] . However , while forced aggregation leads to uniformly sized EBs , it has been shown that in fact , the traditional suspension culture of placing clumps of hESCs directly into low - attachment plates generates EBs with higher levels of hematopoietic di ﬀ erentiation than forced aggregation or hanging drop culture does [ 33 ] . Regardless of the EB formation method employed , it is important Stem Cells International 3 T a b l e 1 : S u mm a r y o f g e n e r a t i o n a n d c h a r a c t e r i z a t i o n o f e r y t h r o i d c e ll s f r o m h u m a n e m b r y o n i c s t e m c e ll s a n d i n d u c e d p l u r i p o t e n t s t e m c e ll s .

Stem Cells International 5 to note that care should be taken to avoid fusion among individual EBs as active migration of cells and the expression of transcription factor Cd × 2 , known for its role in a ﬀ ecting cell fate decisions [ 34 ] , have been observed in a subset of cells at the junction of fusing EBs [ 29 ] . While housing individual EBs in separate wells can prevent the aggregation , it is not recommended , as the paracrine e ﬀ ect enhances hematopoietic di ﬀ erentiation of EBs [ 33 ] . Encapsulating them in size - speciﬁed agarose capsules [ 35 ] may provide an alternative , although the hematopoietic di ﬀ erentiation of encapsulated EBs has not been fully examined . An array of media has been used for the generation of EBs . Our laboratory has routinely used a medium essentially composed of Iscove’s Modiﬁed Dulbecco’s Media , fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) , and protein - free hybridoma medium . Originally , we included basic ﬁbroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) and vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) in the medium [ 17 ] and later found them to be unnecessary in FBS - supplemented media , although VEGF - 165 has been reported to augment erythropoiesis during EB formation [ 16 ] . Lot speciﬁc e ﬀ ects of FBS on hematopoietic di ﬀ er - entiation during EB formation have been noted and thus require prescreening of FBS for the EB assay ( unpublished observations ) . Several laboratories have established serum - free media for EB formation , in which growth factor sup - plementation is required [ 26 ] . Bone morphogenetic protein 4 ( BMP4 ) , VEGF , granulocyte colony - stimulating factor ( G - CSF ) , interleukin - 3 ( IL - 3 ) , stem cell factor ( SCF ) , Flt3 ligand , IL - 6 , insulin - like growth factor - 2 ( IGF - II ) , thrombopoietin ( TPO ) , and bFGF have been used in an assortment of combi - nations to achieve induction of hematopoietic di ﬀ erentiation of EBs [ 22 , 26 , 30 , 33 , 36 , 37 ] . A recent publication utilizing human plasma ﬁnds the addition of BMP4 and VEGF to be indispensable , consistent with the ﬁnding by Tian and colleagues [ 26 ] , and the inclusion of SCF , TPO , Flt3 ligand , erythropoietin ( EPO ) , IL - 3 , and IL - 6 in the EB medium gives the optimal erythropoietic stimulation [ 20 ] . 2 . 3 . From EBs to Erythroid Cells . Di ﬀ erent laboratories har - vest EBs at di ﬀ erent time points for further erythroid di ﬀ erentiation . Our protocol originally included an adher - ent culture step for erythroid induction , but was later streamlined to seeding dissociated day - 7 EBs directly into a serum - free erythroid induction medium in which a large number of relatively pure erythroid cells ( > 90 % ) can be obtained with 21 days of total culture time [ 17 – 19 ] . We ﬁnd that EPO and SCF are absolutely required for the survival and di ﬀ erentiation of erythroid progenitors in EBs ; IL - 3 and IL - 6 augment the expansion of erythroid cells , but G - CSF and GM - CSF are dispensable ( unpublished data ) , similar to the conclusion of others [ 10 ] . If added , FBS has signiﬁcant inhibitory e ﬀ ect on the growth and expansion of these erythroid progenitors from EBs , as previously noted by Zambidis et al . [ 21 ] . Furthermore , while dissociated day - 7 EBs give rise to almost exclusively erythroid cells ( > 90 % ) in the serum - free erythroid induction medium , day - 14 EBs generate a mixture of erythroid and myeloid cells [ 17 ] . Interestingly , while ∼ 5 – 10 % cells of hESC line H1 - derived EBs express glycophorin - A between 7 and 14 days in our FBS - based system [ 17 , 19 ] , very little glycophorin - A expression is detected in the H1 - derived EBs up to 20 days in the human plasma - based cultures in spite of the hematopoietic cytokines supplementation in the medium [ 20 ] . The di ﬀ erences in culture time and cytokine sup - plements notwithstanding , Lapillonne et al . also ﬁnd the unpuriﬁed , dissociated EBs from their human plasma - based cultures generating exclusively erythroid cells when placed in an erythroid expansion medium that also contains human plasma . Lu and colleagues take a di ﬀ erent approach by placing dissociated day - 3 . 5 EBs in blast - colony growth media with the addition of bFGF and recombinant tPTD - HoxB4 fusion protein to expand hemangioblasts prior to transfer into an erythroid di ﬀ erentiation and expansion culture [ 22 ] . A mixture of erythroid and nonerythroid cells is apparently obtained , which requires an overnight adhesion culture to remove nonerythroid cells . 2 . 4 . From Erythroblasts to RBCs . Extended ex vivo propaga - tion of cells is associated with acquisition of genetic alter - ations , including transformation . Safety concerns about in vivo use of such cells therefore have been raised , speciﬁcally in the autologous setting . As terminally di ﬀ erentiated ( and physiologically enucleated ) cells , in this respect , erythrocytes possess considerable advantages over transplants of imma - ture cells or cells with proliferative capacity in spite of their maturity , such as T cells . Several studies show that hESC - and hiPSC - derived erythroblasts are capable of enucleation and become fully mature RBCs . A prolonged culture appears to be an important factor with or without the involvement of stromal cells . Qui and colleagues ﬁnd enucleation can be obtained by sequential exposure of CD34 + cells sorted from FH - B - hTERT / H1 coculture to two sets of cytokines , followed by a 2 - step 10 - day coculture with MS - 5 stromal cells [ 15 ] . The enucleation e ﬃ ciency varies from 1 . 5 % to 16 % for the day - 35 H1 / FH - B - hTERT coculture , and 0 % for the day - 14 H1 / FH - B - hTERT coculture . A 3 - step culture that involves a 15 - day coculture of H1 / mFLSC coculture , followed by a 14 - day erythroid burst colony formation , and then a 7 - day liquid culture expansion also produces clusters of enucleated RBCs with enucleation e ﬃ ciency ranging from 1 . 3 % to 11 . 4 % [ 13 ] . A higher degree of enucleation is achieved by Lu et al . with their hemangioblasts protocol composed of EB formation , hemangioblast expansion , sequential cytokine exposure of the blast cells , and then coculture with human mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs ) , with OP9 mouse stro - mal cells , or without stromal cells [ 22 ] . The enucleation e ﬃ ciencies are 10 % – 30 % without stromal cells , ∼ 30 % on MSC stromal cells , and 30 % – 65 % on OP9 cells , suggesting that the presence of stromal cells signiﬁcantly facilitates the enucleation process . On the other hand , a recent ﬁnding by Lapillonne and colleagues shows that by supplementing culture media with human plasma , a signiﬁcant degree of enucleation is attained without stromal cells in H1 hESCs - derived erythroid cells ( 52 % – 66 % ) [ 20 ] . However , much lower degrees of enucleation ( 4 % – 10 % ) are obtained with erythroid cells derived from 2 separate hiPSC lines using the same protocol , suggesting that the reprogramming process or epigenetic memories retained , may impact the 6 Stem Cells International ability of hiPSC - derived erythroid cells to enucleate . Given the currently still incomplete e ﬃ ciency of enucleation of erythroblasts and incomplete lineage determination in vitro and if these ex vivo generated erythroid cells were to be used in transfusion , it might be reasonable to ﬁlter them through conventional leukocyte ﬁlters , followed by irradiation with 3 , 000 cGy , as erythrocytes tolerate irradiation without critical loss of function . 2 . 5 . Large - Scale Production of Erythroblasts or RBCs from hESCs or hiPSCs . Several publications have claimed that their respective protocol results in large - scale generations of erythroid cells from hESCs or hiPSCs , which is a pre - requisite of any potential clinical usage . With the H1 / FH - B - hTERT coculture system , Qiu et al . obtain approximately 80 erythroid cells per hESC although it is estimated that a 50 × 10 3 - fold expansion is achieved by a single CD34 + cells from the coculture [ 15 ] . Using H1 / mFLSC coculture , Ma and colleagues generate large erythroid bursts consisting of ∼ 0 . 2 × 10 6 erythroid cells per burst [ 13 ] . Taking into consideration the colony forming unit frequencies and further expansion potentials in liquid culture , roughly 1 , 200 erythroid cells are generated per hESC . A slightly higher production e ﬃ ciency is achieved by using EB formation and human plasma supplementation that shows 1 , 500 – 3 , 500 erythroid cells are produced per hESC , but only 200 – 400 erythroid output per hiPSC [ 20 ] . Using recombinant tPTD - HoxB4 fusion protein and hemangioblast approach , Lu and colleagues reported the generation of up to 8 , 000 erythroid cells per hESC [ 22 ] . The highest production e ﬃ ciency is reported by Dias and colleagues employing the OP9 coculture system , followed by dissociation and reaggregation on low attachment plates with the addition of cytokines , and then coculture on MS - 5 feeders [ 8 ] . Up to 200 , 000 erythroid cells are reported to be generated per hESC , and a similar level of expansion is also obtained with hiPSCs , although the requirement of murine cells for coculture throughout the di ﬀ erentiation procedure , in addition to the signiﬁcantly longer culture time ( 70 – 120 days ) , remains a setback for potential clinical applications . Together , these data show that without signiﬁcant progress in generating erythrocytes from hESCs or hiPSCs more cost e ﬀ ectively , the magnitude and cost of replacing donor - derived erythrocytes with these in vitro generated RBCs will be prohibitive , given that one RBC concentrate contains approximately 2 × 10 12 erythrocytes , that is , in a country like Germany , 8 × 10 18 ( 10 11 per head of the population ) red blood cells are transfused in any given year . 3 . Characterization of hESC - and hiPSC - Derived Erythroid Cells 3 . 1 . Globin Chain Expression . Amongst all erythroid - associated characteristics , the globin expression phenotype has been studied most extensively in the hESC - and hiPSC - derived erythroid cells . Our laboratory ﬁnds that the α globin , rather than embryonic ζ globin , is the major α - locus globin expressed , although expression of ζ globin can be detected in all erythroid cells from H1 hESC at the protein level , suggesting a low , but pancellular expression of embryonic ζ globin [ 17 ] , di ﬀ ering from the ﬁnding of Cerdan et al . that shows ζ globin is not expressed by hESC - derived erythroblasts [ 16 ] . The expression of ζ globin is also conﬁrmed by studies in erythroid cells generated from other hESC lines as well as H1 line [ 15 , 21 , 22 , 24 ] , and hiPSCs originated from either fetal or adult tissues [ 20 ] . We ﬁnd the α / ζ globin ratio does not change whether the erythroid cells are derived from day - 7 or day - 14 EBs [ 17 ] , although Qiu and colleagues ﬁnd that by extending the coculture time between hESCs and immortalized human fetal liver hepatocyte line FH - B - hTERT from 14 days to 35 days , a lineage switch occurs and these hESCs - derived erythroid cells express α locus globins with an increased α / ζ globin ratio [ 15 ] . Furthermore , individual clonal erythroid expansion and maturation apparently is accompanied by a maturation switch characterized by an increasing α / ζ globin ratio over time as the hESC - derived erythroid cells proceed from the stage of proerythroblasts to the stage of orthochromatic erythroblasts [ 15 ] . With the exception of the ﬁrst two studies examining the hematopoietic / erythroid di ﬀ erentiation of hESC that claim the adult β globin to be the major globin expressed by hESC - derived erythroid cells [ 9 , 16 ] , all other studies followed ﬁnd embryonic ε and fetal γ globins to be the predominant β - locus globin expressed by these cells , at least initially , regardless of the di ﬀ erentiation methods employed or the ontogenic origin of the hiPSCs [ 1 , 8 , 13 , 15 , 17 – 22 , 24 ] . While some studies ﬁnd little changes in ε / γ ratio in mature erythroid cells derived from di ﬀ erent time points of culture [ 8 , 17 , 24 ] , Qiu et al . reported that similar to their ﬁnding in the changes in α / ζ globin ratio , increasing coculture time also leads to the generation of erythroid cells expressing mainly fetal γ globin [ 15 ] . An increase in the adult β globin expression with prolonged coculture time is also observed albeit its expression level is low ( ∼ 2 % of all β - locus globins ) , consistent with the ﬁndings of others [ 8 , 22 , 24 ] . Interestingly , Ma et al . show a more drastic increase in β globin expression with their erythroid cells derived from H1 / mFLSC cells coculture . The globin expres - sion in the erythroid cells of individual clones changes in a time - dependent manner : embryonic ε - globin - expressing erythroid cells from individual clones decrease from ∼ 100 % to ∼ 50 % , whereas adult - type β - globin - expressing cells increase to ∼ 100 % in all clones examined [ 13 ] . It is not known , however , whether the adult β globin actually is the major β - locus globin expressed , given that 100 % of the cells are also expressing γ globin , and ∼ 50 % of the cells are expressing ε globin . Nevertheless , these studies provide supporting evidence that with prolonged coculture , and / or prolonged erythroid expansion , the erythroid cells adapt a more developmentally advanced globin expression pattern . The transcriptional controls of the globin expression have not yet been studied in these cells , but a limited number of studies have been done to analyze the epigenetic landscape of β globin locus of hESC - derived erythroid cells . It is found that domains of DNA hypomethylation spanning thousands of base pairs within domains of acetylated histones are Stem Cells International 7 established around the most highly expressed genes during each developmental stage when comparing hESC - derived erythroblasts to uncultured FL and bone marrow cells [ 38 , 39 ] . In addition , our laboratory also ﬁnds that throughout development , human primary erythroblasts employ simi - lar histone codes including enrichment of H3K4me3 and selective depletion of H3K27me1 to ensure proper temporal expression of speciﬁc globin genes ( unpublished data ) . Furthermore , a looping mechanism is also at play to bring the hypersensitive sites of the LCR into physical contact with the ε globin promoter , presumably to initiate transcription via the formation of an active chromatin hub , in the ε globin producing hESC - derived erythroid cells . 3 . 2 . Hemoglobin Analyses and Functionality . As compared to the globin chains , few studies have been conducted to study the hemoglobin tetramers in the hESC - or hiPSC - derived erythroid cells . Using CE - HPLC , it is found that the mature erythroid cells , derived from both hESCs and iPSCs based on the EB / human plasma culture system , express mostly HbF ( α 2 γ 2 ) with little Hb Gower I ( ζ 2 ε 2 ) or Gower II ( α 2 ε 2 ) [ 20 ] . Furthermore , the CO - rebinding kinetics , which probe the allosteric equilibrium of R and T states , of hemoglobin from hESC - and hiPSC - derived erythroid cells , are almost identical to those of cord blood , with or without potent allosteric e ﬀ ector inositol hexaphosphate , suggesting that the HbF in these erythroid cells is functional [ 20 ] . In addition , the oxygen dissociation curve of hESC - derived erythroid cells is displaced to the left , similar to that of the human cord blood , as compared to that of adult RBCs , consistent with the higher a ﬃ nity of HbF to oxygen than HbA [ 13 , 22 , 24 ] . The decreased response to 2 , 3 - diphosphoglycerate ( 2 , 3 - DPG ) depletion as compared to adult RBCs is consistent with the lack of interaction between HbF and 2 , 3 - DPG [ 22 ] . In addition , hESC - derived erythroid cells also have high glucose - 6 - phosphate dehydrogenase activity , conﬁrming that they are protected from oxidative damage [ 13 ] . Together , these data indicate that hESC - and hiPSC - derived erythroid cells will function as oxygen carriers like cord blood or fetal blood . In contrast , a recent study using the hemangioblast approach shows that hESC - derived erythroid cells produce mainly Hb Gower1 ( ζ 2 ε 2 ) with low levels of HbF , Hb Portland ( ζ 2 γ 2 ) , and Hb Gower - 2 ( α 2 ε 2 ) , each represents less than 5 % of the total hemoglobin [ 23 ] . Moreover , these hemangioblast - derived erythroid cells also have an elevated amount of Hb Barts ( G γ 4 ) that accounts for 12 % – 18 % of the total hemoglobin . As Hb Barts has extremely high a ﬃ nity to oxygen , this ﬁnding appears to contradict the previous report by the same group that hESC - derived erythroid cells have an oxygen dissociation curve only slightly displaced to the left of the adult RBCs , and that they show a comparable Bohr e ﬀ ect at physiologic pH [ 22 ] . In addition to not releasing oxygen into the tissue due to extremely high oxygen a ﬃ nity , Hb Barts is moderately insoluble , and therefore accumulates in the red blood cells . Hence , this study would argue that hESC - derived erythroid cells , despite the large - scale production using hemangioblast protocol [ 22 ] , can not be used for transfusion . The authors do o ﬀ er that , however , with further maturation that leads to developmentally more advanced erythroblasts or enucleated RBCs , the level of Hb Barts may decrease in these hESC - derived erythroid cells . 4 . Future Challenges The magnitude and cost of replacing donor - derived erythro - cytes with in vitro generated RBCs is prohibitive and requires signiﬁcant progress in the expansion , maturation , and terminal di ﬀ erentiation / enucleation of erythrocytes to make the transfusion products cost e ﬀ ective . A recently published method of culturing hESCs and hiPSCs in suspension may aid in the scaling up production of hESCs and hiPSCs [ 40 ] . In addition , the proposed utilization of synthetic 3D structures mimicking bone marrow structure [ 41 ] and the manipulation of transcriptional environment , such as ectopic expression of engineered Nup98 - HoxA10 fusion protein [ 42 ] and downregulation of microRNAs - 126 / 125 ∗ [ 43 ] , may improve the erythroid production e ﬃ ciency . However , even if a cost - e ﬀ ective method of generating erythrocytes from hESCs or hiPSCs were achieved , signif - icant challenges remain to be met before the therapeutic use of these cells . While not expressing HLA , mature RBCs express many surface antigens against which regular ( present in all individuals not expressing the antigen ) or irregular ( acquired after contact with the antigen ) antibodies can be directed . Thirty blood group systems , or antigen families , with almost 400 antigens have been documented , and antibodies against all of these antigens have been described . If ignored , such antibodies cause acute , potentially deadly , or delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions . Therefore , the presence of such antibodies necessitates selection of antigen - negative RBCs . Since antigens are expressed from genes located throughout the genome , any combination of blood group antigens can occur , thus in theory , an almost inﬁnite number of hESC or iPSC lines would be required to generate compatible erythrocytes for all individuals . Generation of null variants for blood group antigens via genetic manipula - tion is not conducive as null variants have been described for many blood group antigens , but all of which are associated with structural defects and / or with the generation of alter - native antigens , with the exception of Rh dd ( Rh - negative , the null variant which represents the counter antigen to Rh D ) and O ( absence of both A and B transferase ) . It may be conceptually reasonable to generate a single hiPSC line from an O Rh negative ccddee K negative donor heterozygous for as many antigens as possible ( to decrease foreign antigen dose and hence , antigenicity ) and propagate it in huge biogenerators as a source for nonimmunized patients . For allo - ( poly ) sensitized or at risk , chronically transfusion - dependent patients , speciﬁcally those of rare blood types , autologous iPSC lines could be established , from which individualized erythrocytes could be generated and stored . It must be stressed , however , that the membrane protein and glycosylation proﬁle of RBCs produced in vitro , even from autologous iPSC lines , may be altered compared to that of the in vivo produced RBCs , due to the lack of complex environment found in vivo , or an imbalanced transcription factor expression [ 44 ] . The important ﬁnding that iPSCs and their progeny are rejected in the autologous setting [ 45 ] 8 Stem Cells International appropriately brings to the forefront the issue of antigenicity of ex vivo generated cells due to expression of neoantigens . It may be plausible to enzymatically remove surface antigens . However , such approach has not been achieved except for A and B substances [ 46 ] . Furthermore , rigorous studies must be conducted to fully characterize these in vitro generated RBCs including their membrane surface potential , pliability , and half - life in vivo , in addition to proﬁling their hemoglobin packing , gas exchange properties , and immunogenicities . The sensitivity of the system is well illustrated by the recent evidence that has come forth about e ﬀ ects of ageing of erythrocytes on their therapeutic beneﬁt—free hemoglobin , increased membrane rigidity , membrane damage , and altered O 2 a ﬃ nity of stored red cells have all been implicated in adverse outcomes observed with older erythrocytes [ 47 ] . Thus , even after all the challenges of devising suitable in vitro systems for expan - sion , maturation and terminal di ﬀ erentiation / enucleation of erythrocytes from primitive cell sources have been mastered , all of these biophysical parameters will still need to be carefully compared between in vitro and in vivo generated erythrocytes before they can be used clinically . 5 . Conclusions Signiﬁcant progress has been made in generating erythroid cells from hESCs and hiPSCs . The production e ﬃ ciency of up to 200 , 000 cells per hESC or iPSC has been achieved [ 8 ] . Unfortunately , the methodology that generates the highest number of erythroid cells per hESC is the least deﬁned and relies heavily on the presence of murine stromal cells : ﬁrst OP9 , then MS - 5 . The hemoglobin expression pattern and enucleation e ﬃ ciency are also less clear with erythroid cells derived from this particular method , than from the other mass production protocols [ 13 , 20 , 22 , 23 ] . Further investigation of the hemoglobin tetramer composition is critical , as it is shown that erythroid cells generated from the protocol with the second - highest production e ﬃ ciency ( 8 , 000 erythroid cells per hESC ) have mostly Hb Gower I , followed by an elevated level of Hb Barts , which would not be suitable for transfusion [ 23 ] . The method proposed by Lapillonne and colleagues , without using animal products or stromal cell lines , generates moderate number of erythroid cells from hESCs ( 1 , 500 – 3 , 500 erythroid cells per hESC ) that enucleate e ﬃ ciently ( ∼ 60 % ) with functional HbF tetramers as the major hemoglobin ( ∼ 93 % ) . Unfortunately , this method appears to work less e ﬃ ciently with hiPSC , which is important since one of the major goals of generating RBCs is for the transfusion needs of patients with rare blood phenotypes or those that have been alloimmunized . The decreased e ﬃ ciency of erythroid generation may be o ﬀ set by prescreening for hiPSC lines with increased erythroid di ﬀ erentiation propensity , as line - to - line variation has been documented [ 18 , 19 ] , or by simply increasing the input number of hiPSCs . Alternatively , generating immortal ery - throid progenitor lines capable of terminal di ﬀ erentiation and enucleation , which have been shown to be successful in murine ESC - derived cells [ 48 ] , may be a viable option . Finally , little is known about these hESC - and hiPSC - derived erythroid cells other than their hemoglobin composition , gas exchange properties , and their growth and expansion pattern in response to various methods . Membrane compositions , surface antigen expression , immunogenicity , deformability , and half - life in vivo all require further and vigorous inves - tigations before the transition from bench to bedside can occur .

Even though the production of orthochromatic erythroblasts can be scaled up to fulﬁll clinical requirements , enucleation remains one of the critical rate - limiting steps in the production of transfusable red blood cells . Mammalian erythrocytes extrude their nucleus prior to entering circulation , likely to impart ﬂexibility and improve the ability to traverse through capillaries that are half the size of erythrocytes . Recently , there have been many advances in our understanding of the mechanisms underlying mammalian erythrocyte enucleation . This review summarizes these advances , discusses the possible future directions in the ﬁeld , and evaluates the prospects for improved ex vivo production of red blood cells . 1 . Introduction Blood transfusions are a common practice to treat severe anemia and shock . Even though developed countries by and large have su ﬃ cient supplies of transfusable blood , an increase in the incidence of complications from allo - genic immune reactions provides impetus to search for alternatives that are less immunogenic [ 1 – 3 ] . Moreover , developing and third world countries battle a shortage of blood units for transfusions [ 4 ] . One alternative under investigation is the ex vivo derivation of red blood cells from autologous hematopoietic stem / progenitor cells . In addition to enhancing the supply of transfusable blood , this approach may decrease the incidence of allogenic immune reactions in chronic transfusion - dependent patients . Human embryonic stem cells , CD34 + cells from umbilical cord blood , adult hematopoietic stem / progenitor cells , peripheral blood CD34 + cells , or human - induced pluripotent stem cells ( iPS cells ) can all be used as source for synthesizing RBCs [ 5 ] . In all these systems , however , the e ﬃ ciency of enucleation is low . Enucleation is an important criterion because nucleated erythroblasts are not as e ﬃ cient in oxygen transport and because they are likely to undergo hemolysis as they traverse through narrow capillaries . Enucleated cells also o ﬀ er the beneﬁt of lacking DNA and the ability to divide , obviating the risk of introducing a malignancy into the recipients [ 6 , 7 ] . Enucleation remains one of the critical rate - limiting steps of in vitro RBC synthesis . Lu et al . achieved 60 % enucleation of erythroblasts derived from human ES cells ( hES cells ) . The RBCs produced expressed mainly fetal and embryonic hemoglobin and were comparable to normal RBCs in terms of oxygen delivery [ 8 ] . Recently , Lapillonne et al . have reported the production of red blood cells from human iPS cells . Although the majority of the culture consisted of orthochromatic erythroblasts , enucleated RBCs accounted for only between 4 and 10 % of the culture [ 9 ] . Thus , there is a long way to go in terms of achieving 100 % enucleation in vitro . This review will summarize the current mechanistic understanding of enucleation , propose a new model , and discuss future research directions . 2 . Deﬁning Erythroblast Enucleation Mammals have evolved to enucleate their erythroblasts while other animals maintain circulation of RBCs with condensed pyknotic nuclei . Of note , however , the circulation of early mammalian embryos includes nucleated primitive erythroid cells . These cells mature in the bloodstream between embryonic days ( E ) 14 . 5 and E16 . 5 of mouse gestation and eventually enucleate likely within the fetal liver [ 10 ] . Deﬁnitive erythropoiesis , which leads to exclusive 2 Stem Cells International production of enucleated reticulocytes , begins in mid gesta - tion . RBCs derived from deﬁnitive erythropoiesis originate in the fetal liver or bone marrow depending upon the age of the fetus [ 11 ] . In all cases , erythroblasts are derived from hematopoietic stem cells ( HSCs ) . The ﬁrst cell committed towards the erythroid lineage is the burst forming unit - erythroid ( BFU - E ) , which further proliferates and matures to the colony - forming unit E ( CFU - E ) . The BFU - E stage is the most proliferative segment of the di ﬀ erentiation program followed by the CFU - E stage . Acquisition of EPO receptors occur in the mid - to - late stage of BFU - E , and by the time these cells reach CFU - E stage maximum numbers of EPO receptors are present on their surface [ 12 ] . During this time period , cells are completely dependent on erythropoietin ( EPO ) for their survival [ 13 ] . The CFU - E then undergoes a series of maturational steps named proerythroblasts , basophilic erythroblasts , polychromatic erythroblasts , and eventually orthochromatic erythroblasts , at which point they exit the cell cycle . By the time , the cells reach late polychromatic erythroblast stage the cells are independent of EPO for their survival [ 14 ] . Other cytokines and humeral factors that may be required to promote di ﬀ erentiation beyond the poly - chromatic stage has not been identiﬁed although autocrine production of several cytokines have been observed [ 15 , 16 ] . Whether these cytokines provide the necessary signals for terminal di ﬀ erentiation including enucleation is unclear at this point . Throughout the di ﬀ erentiation program , erythroid progenitors and erythroblasts undergo numerous morphological changes . These include ( 1 ) a decrease in cell size , ( 2 ) nuclear condensation , and ( 3 ) an increase in the cytoplasmic nuclear ratio . As red cells mature , chromatin becomes condensed , and transcription in general is suppressed . A network of chromatin factors and histone modifying proteins likely contribute to this process . For example , the nonhistone nuclear protein mature erythrocyte nuclear termination stage speciﬁc protein ( MENT ) has been shown to promote chromatin condensation and nuclear collapse at the terminal stage of maturation of chicken erythrocytes [ 17 ] . Similarly , the condensin II subunit mCAP - G2 represses transcrip - tion by recruiting class I histone deacetylases ( HDACs ) and promotes terminal di ﬀ erentiation of mammalian cells [ 18 ] . During maturation of murine erythroblasts , histone H3 ( K9 ) dimethylation was found to increase while his - tone H4 ( K12 ) acetylation was dramatically decreased [ 19 ] . Consistent with a requirement for decreased acetylation , treatment of murine erythroblasts with the HDAC inhibitors trichostatin A or valproic acid blocked chromatin conden - sation and enucleation [ 19 , 20 ] . Moreover , knockdown of HDAC2 led to a prominent block in condensation and nuclear extrusion . Recent studies have further revealed that downregulation of miR - 191 , which occurs during normal di ﬀ erentiation , contributes to chromatin condensation by allowing the upregulation of Riok3 , an atypical protein kinase , and Mxi1 , a c - myc antagonist [ 21 ] . Downregu - lation of myc appears to be required not for cell cycle arrest , but rather to allow for nuclear condensation and histone deacetylation [ 22 ] . Together these studies show that chromatin condensation is an integral part of erythroblast maturation . After exiting the ﬁnal cell cycle , the nuclei of orthochro - matic erythroblasts are polarized to one side of the cell . Eventually these cells enucleate to form reticulocyte and a “pyrenocyte , ” the extruded nucleus with a thin rim of cytoplasm surrounded by a plasma membrane [ 10 , 23 ] . Pyrenocytes are engulfed by macrophages in erythroblastic islands within the fetal liver and bone marrow . During terminal di ﬀ erentiation , cells undergo multiple cellular proc - esses including protein sorting , autophagy , membrane mat - uration , vesicle tra ﬃ cking , and cytoskeletal remodeling . Important questions to the ﬁeld include the following ( 1 ) To what extent do these processes contribute to enucleation ? ( 2 ) Which of these steps are required for enucleation ? ( 3 ) At which point in the di ﬀ erentiation continuum does enucle - ation start ? ( 4 ) Can enucleation occur in a cell that is not completely matured , such as a polychromatic erythroblast ? ( 5 ) Can enucleation proceed before nuclear condensation is completed ? At this point , it has not been demonstrated whether enucleation can occur in an immature erythroblast . Based on the model that chromatin condensation is a prerequisite for enucleation [ 19 , 20 , 24 ] , however , one would assume that this is unlikely . Examining the nuclei engulfed by macrophages within genetically modiﬁed mice that have a block in maturation of late erythroblasts may help answer whether enucleation can take place in erythroblasts other than orthochromatic erythroblasts . Since nuclear condensation and other morphological changes are progressive processes that proceed from proerythroblasts through orthochromatic erythroblasts , and since primitive RBCs and nucleated peripheral blood RBCs of lower animals have condensed nuclei , for the purposes of this review , we will consider enucleation to be a process that begins with polarization of nucleus in an orthochromatic erythroblast . 3 . Mechanism of Enucleation 3 . 1 . Apoptosis , Asymmetric Cytokinesis , or Other ? . Histori - cally there have been two prominent models of enucleation : apoptosis and asymmetric cytokinesis . The presence of partial karyolysis and leakage of nuclear material into the cytoplasm visualized by electron microscopy favors the apoptosis model [ 25 ] . Additional evidence includes the prevailing model that lens epithelial cells and keratinocytes undergo a mechanism similar to programmed cell death to eliminate their nuclei [ 26 , 27 ] . To directly test this whether apoptosis is required for enucleation , Carlile et al . studied the e ﬀ ect of siRNA - mediated caspase knockdown on enucleation and found that there was a 50 % decrease in enucleated cells in the knockdown condition as compared to control . However , the authors noted that maturation was blocked at a stage between proerythroblasts and basophilic erythroblasts , suggesting a role for caspases at an earlier stage of erythroblast development [ 28 ] . Furthermore , Krauss et al . observed that critical nuclear structures such as the nuclear matrix protein NuMA ( nuclear mitotic apparatus ) and the splicing factors Sm and SC35 , as well as the Stem Cells International 3 interaction between lamin B with the nuclear envelope and DNA persisted during late erythroblast development prior to enucleation , consistent with an absence of caspase activity [ 29 ] . In addition , treatment of enucleating erythroblasts with pan - caspase inhibitors did not block enucleation [ 23 ] . Together , these ﬁndings strongly suggest that apoptosis is not involved in enucleation per se . The cytokinetic model posits that nuclear extrusion is a form of cell division , in which the nucleus is separated from the cytoplasm by an active process that involves cytokinetic machinery . By this deﬁnition , an enucleating cell should have a well - deﬁned cleavage furrow , a contractile actomyosin ring , and a stage of completion with abscission [ 30 ] . Indeed , many studies including ultra - structural observations from the 1960s lend support to this model . For example , Skutelsky and Danon and others noticed that the pyrenocytes had a thin rim of cytoplasm surrounded by an intact plasma membrane [ 23 , 25 , 31 – 34 ] , a ﬁnding that conﬁrms that the nucleus is not extruded out or exocytosed , but rather separated in a well - orchestrated process . Moreover , one can see a constricted surface resembling a cleavage furrow on enucleating erythroblasts [ 32 , 33 , 35 , 36 ] . Further , there are numerous studies showing that cytochalasin D , an actin - depolymerizing agent which blocks ﬁlamentous actin formation , inhibits enucleation of late erythroblasts in - vitro [ 23 , 33 , 35 , 37 ] . It has also been shown by immunoﬂuo - rescence that actin accumulates in the region between the nucleus and the cytoplasm close to an anatomic constriction zone [ 33 , 38 , 39 ] . Finally , elegant studies with murine primary erythroblasts have demonstrated that Rac1 and Rac2 function through mDia2 to contribute to actin accumulation in the constriction zone [ 36 ] . While these ﬁndings provide strong evidence to support a role for the actin cytoskeleton in erythroblast maturation , it is unclear regarding the speciﬁc role actin is playing in enucleation , including whether it interacts with nonmuscle myosin II to form a contractile actin ring similar to cytokinesis ( Figure 1 ) . In addition to the actin cytoskeleton , microtubules play an important role in cell division including cleavage furrow formation [ 30 ] . Studies by Koury et al . showed that the inhibition of microtubules with various toxins such as colchicine , vinblastine and taxol did not a ﬀ ect enucleation [ 33 ] . Ji et al . showed that enucleation does not depend on RhoA activity , using dominant negative mutants of RhoA and C3 exoenzyme , a speciﬁc inhibitor of RhoA [ 36 ] . It is well known that RhoA is involved in the formation and ingression of cleavage furrow . RhoA when activated accumulates in the cleavage furrow and further activates downstream e ﬀ ectors including Rho kinase ( ROCK ) , citron kinase , LIM kinase , and formins [ 40 – 43 ] . Hence a lack of role for RhoA and microtubule in enucleation suggests that the anatomical constriction zone that is visible on enucleating cell may not be actually a cleavage furrow . What about intermediate ﬁlaments ? Using murine splenic erythroblasts infected with the anemia - inducing strain of Friend virus ( FVA ) , Koury et al . found that ery - throblasts approaching enucleation downregulate expression of vimentin [ 33 ] . Further , Xue et al . , using immunoﬂuo - rescence techniques , observed that vimentin anchored the nuclear lamina to the center of the cell as well as to the plasma membrane periphery and was expressed during the periods of 12 , 24 , and 36 hours of FVA in vitro culture but lost by 36 – 48 hours [ 39 ] . This loss of vimentin could release the nucleus and enable actin to push it towards one end of the cell close to plasma membrane . Of note , circulating avian erythrocytes continue to have intact vimentin , which might be one of the reasons why they resist enucleation [ 44 ] . To test whether actin functions as contractile actomyosin ring in nuclear extrusion , Keerthivasan et al . treated pri - mary murine and human erythroblasts with blebbistatin at di ﬀ erent time points and assayed the e ﬀ ect on cell division and enucleation [ 34 ] . Blebbistatin is a speciﬁc nonmuscle myosin II ATPase inhibitor that blocks the contractility of the actomyosin ring in cytokinetic cells and results in polyploidy of dividing cells without a ﬀ ecting the formation of actin cytoskeleton [ 45 ] . Keerthivasan et al . showed that blebbistatin potently inhibited enucleation when added to cultures at 24 hours , when the majority of cells were undergoing cell division . In this case , blebbistatin resulted in cell cycle arrest and the accumulation of polyploid cells . In contrast , blebbistatin had little e ﬀ ect on enucleation when it was added to cells at 38 hours , a time when the majority of cells are postmitotic [ 34 ] . These ﬁndings suggest that although actin accumulates in the region between the nucleus and cytoplasm during late stage erythroblasts , its role as a contractile actomyosin ring similar to cytokinesis in enucleation is questionable . Abscission is the ﬁnal stage of cytokinesis and involves tra ﬃ cking of vesicles to the midbody region and fusion of these vesicles to lead to separation of the daughter cells [ 46 , 47 ] . Throughout cytokinesis , membranes are supplied to the progressing tip of the cleavage furrow and the abscission site through golgi and recycling endosome - derived vesicles [ 48 , 49 ] . Several lines of evidence support the model that vesicle tra ﬃ cking directly contributes to enucleation , in large part by providing membranes to facilitate the separation of the pyrenocyte from the reticulocyte . First , electron microscopy has revealed the presence of vesicles and U - shaped tubes in the region between the nucleus and incipient reticulocyte [ 25 , 34 , 50 ] . Second , there is an accumulation of transferrin laden vesicles / vacuoles in the region between the nucleus and the cytoplasm [ 34 , 50 ] . Third , disrupting vesicle tra ﬃ cking by a battery of chemical inhibitors inhibited accumulation of those vesicles and blocked erythroblast enucleation [ 34 ] . Finally , siRNA - mediated knockdown of clathrin inhibited enucleation of human primary erythroblasts [ 34 ] . These ﬁndings strongly suggest that vesicle tra ﬃ cking is a key component of erythroblast enucleation and that at least a part of nuclear extrusion process is similar to abscission ( Figure 1 ) . 3 . 2 . Protein Sorting and Enucleation . An important event during enucleation is the di ﬀ erential sorting of proteins to the pyrenocyte and the reticulocyte . Geiduschek and Singer studied this phenomenon by an immunoﬂuorescence technique and followed the distribution of lectin receptors and spectrin through erythroid di ﬀ erentiation . They found that spectrin completely sorts to the incipient reticulocyte 4 Stem Cells International Myosin Actin Vesicle trafﬁcking pathway Cytokinesis Enucleation Cleavage plane speciﬁcation Rearrangement of microtubule structure Contractilering assembly Ring ingression Completion Formation of actin cytoskeleton and pushing nucleus to one pole Vesicle trafﬁcking creating asymmetric protein distribution Protrusion of pyrenocyte side plasma membrane along with nucleus Accumulation of vesicles and vacuoles in the region between nucleus and cytoplasm Coalescence of vesicles / vacuoles Polymerization Myosin - dependent action IIA V and VI Figure 1 : Key events in cytokinesis and enucleation . Even though the ﬁnal stages of cytokinesis and enucleation are both driven by vesicle tra ﬃ cking , the preceding events are substantially di ﬀ erent between the two processes . while receptors for concanavalin A are restricted to the plasma membrane surrounding the extruding nucleus [ 51 ] . Using murine erythroleukemia ( MEL ) cells , Patel and Lodish reported that enucleated cells detach from a ﬁbronectin matrix due to the loss of the ﬁbronectin receptor while both Band 3 and ankyrin are enriched in the reticulocyte [ 52 ] . Transferrin has been found to di ﬀ erentially sort to the pyrenocyte membrane while glycophorin A / TER119 segregates to the reticulocyte membrane [ 53 , 54 ] . Inhibition of vesicle tra ﬃ cking by MiTMAB ( dynamin inhibitor ) prevented sorting of the transferrin receptor ( CD71 ) towards pyrenocyte side of membrane of enucleating erythroblasts [ 34 ] . Thus , sorting of proteins and enucleation appear to be coupled in that both require vesicle tra ﬃ cking . Primitive erythroblasts also di ﬀ erentially sort proteins , such as TER119 ( reticulocyte ) and α 4 - integrin ( pyrenocyte ) in a manner similar to deﬁnitive erythroblasts [ 55 ] . This di ﬀ erence in composition of the membranes of pyrenocyte versus reticulocyte likely assists pyrenocytes to attach to macrophages while allowing reticulocytes to move into the circulation . Further , nuclear positioning , an essential component of enucleation ( Figure 1 ) , can be speculated to depend on protein sorting and vesicle tra ﬃ cking . Interestingly , the observations by Skutelsky and Danon [ 31 ] and Ji et al . [ 56 ] about the nuclear positioning supports this notion . The former group , using ﬁxed sections , noticed that some erythroblasts were having protrusion of the plasma mem - brane along with a portion of nuclei . They saw a variety of sizes of this protrusion , including in some cells the nucleus completely occupied inside the cavity . Using these pieces of ﬁxed section observations , they constructed a model in which the nucleus at ﬁrst occupies an eccentric position adjacent to the cell membrane and a cytoplasmic protrusion ensues taking along the nuclei until the protrusion com - pletely holds the nuclei . Ji et al . observed a similar process in murine fetal liver erythroblasts using live cell imaging . These ﬁndings suggest that the visible constriction zone on the surface of enucleating erythroblast is indeed a junction region in the plasma membrane that separates pyrenocyte and reticulocyte membrane . The membrane that is destined to enclose pyrenocyte that is in close proximity to nucleus lacks actin cytoskeleton , spectrin , and other critical proteins and as a result can be visualized to balloon out without resisting the pressure exerted by the cytoskeletal activity ( Figure 2 ) . Stem Cells International 5 Figure 2 : Model of enucleation . A schematic representation of the enucleation process in mammals is shown . Yellow arrows denote the direction of force applied over the nucleus by actin cytoskeleton . Blue arrows and vesicles denote the protein tra ﬃ cking , which directs the proteins that are destined to reach the pyrenocyte . The blue membrane adjacent to the nucleus is the part of the pyrenocyte membrane lacking spectrin , glycophorin A , actin cytoskeleton , and other reticulocyte - speciﬁc proteins that are di ﬀ erentially sorted . The green arrow represents the direction of the force exerted on the pyrenocyte by a bound macrophage while the red arrow indicates the movement of the reticulocyte away from the center by lamellipodia and ﬁlopodia . 3 . 3 . Macrophages and Enucleation . Pyrenocytes gradually start expressing phosphatidyl serine on their surface , pro - viding an “eat me” signal for macrophages , which engulf them [ 23 ] . The engulfed nucleus is then digested in lysosome where DNase II digests the DNA within the engulfed nuclei [ 57 ] . The importance of this pathway for continued erythropoiesis is highlighted by the phenotype of DNase II knockout mice , which die in utero due to embryonic lethal anemia . When DNase II null fetal liver progenitors are transplanted into lethally irradiated recipients , the pro - genitors give rise to normal erythrocytes , showing that the defect is noncell autonomous , attributable to macrophages . The important role of macrophages in enucleation is also supported by the phenotype of retinoblastoma ( Rb ) tumor suppressor gene knockout mice . Mutant embryos exhibited a defect in enucleation , which was attributed to a lack of suppression of Id1 ( a helix - loop - helix protein ) by Rb in macrophages [ 58 ] . In vivo , deﬁnitive erythropoiesis takes place within erythroblastic islands . Macrophages reside at the center of island , with erythroblasts at various di ﬀ erentiation stages layered around the outside [ 59 – 61 ] . Hanspal and Hanspal found that the interaction between erythroblasts and macrophages is needed for normal proliferation of erythroblasts as well as for enucleation [ 62 ] . This interaction is mediated by EMP ( erythroblast macrophage protein ) , which functions to prevent apoptosis of developing ery - throblasts [ 63 ] . While these studies point to an essential role for macrophages during erythropoiesis , many groups have shown that erythroblasts cultured in vitro in the absence of macrophages undergo complete di ﬀ erentiation including nuclear extrusion [ 16 , 64 ] . Hence we can conclude that enucleation formally can occur without macrophages . 6 Stem Cells International However , in vivo macrophages appear to play important functions in enucleation and erythroid homeostasis . 3 . 4 . Autophagy and Enucleation . Another important phe - nomenon that takes place during enucleation is autophagy , a process by which cellular components such as organelles and protein aggregates are catabolized [ 65 – 67 ] . Autophagy pro - ceeds in multiple steps . First , a double membrane develops around the cytoplasmic cargo to be degraded by autophagy . This double membrane can be derived from either the endoplasmic reticulum [ 68 , 69 ] or the plasma membrane [ 70 , 71 ] . Fusion of these membranes to one other sequesters the cargo to form an autophagosome , which in turn fuses with multivesicular body / late endosome / lysosome , leading to degradation of the cargo and the inner bilayer of the double - membrane . This vacuole that contains digested cytosolic contents is called autophagolysosome [ 72 – 74 ] . In erythroblasts , mitochondrial clearance has been shown to be accomplished through autophagy [ 75 ] . Multiple studies have shown that Nix ( Bnip3L ) , a Bcl - 2 family member , is required for mitochondrial clearance in reticu - locytes and that loss of Nix leads to anemia [ 76 , 77 ] . The lack of clearance has been proposed to be the result of defective entry of mitochondria into autophagosomes [ 77 – 79 ] . Although loss of Nix did not a ﬀ ect enucleation [ 77 , 80 ] , it is interesting to consider the dependence of autophagy on vesicle tra ﬃ cking . The inhibition of vesicle tra ﬃ cking blocked formation of autophagolysosomes and resulted in enucleation defects ( G . K , A . W , and JDC , unpublished data ) . Further studies on the relationship between autophagy , vesicle tra ﬃ cking , and enucleation may shed additional light on erythrocyte maturation . 3 . 5 . Possible Roles of Actin in Enucleation . Actin has multiple roles in a cell , including cell division , migration , junction formation , chromatin remodeling , transcriptional regula - tion , vesicle tra ﬃ cking , and cell shape regulation [ 81 ] . In an enucleating cell , actin could be involved in maintaining the shape of the cell , and / or in maintenance of polarity of the nucleus . Actin may also assist in the formation and movement of endocytic vesicles [ 82 , 83 ] . Indeed , actin has been proposed to mediate the short - range movement of vesicles and may work together with myosins V and VI and members of the kinesin family [ 84 ] , to direct vesicles during enucleation . Actin is regulated by Rac proteins that play a role in the formation of lamellipodia , ﬁlopodia , membrane ru ﬄ es , and cell movement [ 85 ] . Taken together , actin likely participates in erythroid maturation by polarization of nucleus , by promoting the accumulation and coalescence of vesicles / vacuoles , and by inducing migration of the reticulocyte away from the pyrenocyte . 4 . Model of Enucleation Erythroblast enucleation is a unique process that incorpo - rates multiple aspects of cytokinesis and vesicle tra ﬃ cking ( Figure 2 ) . First , one or more cellular signals initiate the process of enucleation . At least one study suggested that p38 mitogen - activated protein ( MAP ) kinase ( MAPK ) signaling is involved in late erythroid di ﬀ erentiation and enucleation [ 86 ] . However , if extracellular factors either secreted by the bone marrow stroma or by erythroblasts themselves play a role in engaging yet unidentiﬁed receptors to initiate an intracellular signaling cascade / s leading to the activation of signaling molecules such as the p38MAP kinase and / or the Rac - 1 GTPase that may begin the enucleation process is yet to be determined . Once the process is initiated , the actin cytoskeleton polarizes the condensed nucleus , free from intermediate ﬁlament attachments , to one side of the cell . Note that this polarization need not be random , and there may well exist novel factors that determine the polarity . At this time , the region of plasma membrane in close proximity to the nucleus yields to form a small extrusion that includes a portion of the nucleus . We speculate that vesicle tra ﬃ cking and other protein - sorting pathways provide additional membrane to the pyrenocyte region , allowing expansion and further extrusion of the nucleus . The subsequent formation and coalescence of U - shaped channels and vesicles that have accumulated in the region between the nucleus and incipient reticulocyte allows for separation of the reticulocyte from the pyrenocyte . In vivo , this process is likely complemented by attachment of the pyrenocyte to a nearby macrophage coupled with actin - mediated movement of the reticulocyte away from the pyrenocyte . Thus , multiple pathways , including chromatin condensa - tion , actomyosin motors , and vesicle tra ﬃ cking work in concert to ensure orchestrated terminal maturation of red cells . 5 . Future Directions Although there have been many advances in the past decade , several aspects of enucleation remain unclear . First , what are the signaling pathways that trigger enucleation in vivo and in vitro ? Second , what , if any , factors determine polarity in enucleating cells ? Third , what are the contributions of macrophages and how can these cells be harnessed to improve ex vivo enucleation ? Finally , which motor proteins are responsible for coordinating the movement of the nucleus and cytoplasmic vesicles ? It is likely that these questions will be answered in the next decade of research . Acknowledgments The authors thank Lauren Diebold and Laure Gilles for assistance with the manuscript .

In Human Erythroid Massive Ampliﬁcation ( HEMA ) cultures , AB mononuclear cells ( MNC ) generate 1 - log more erythroid cells ( EBs ) than the corresponding CD34 pos cells , suggesting that MNC may also contain CD34 neg HPC . To clarify the phenotype of AB HPC which generate EBs in these cultures , ﬂow cytometric proﬁling for CD34 / CD36 expression , followed by isolation and functional characterization ( colony - forming - ability in semisolid - media and fold - increase in HEMA ) were performed . Four populations with erythroid di ﬀ erentiation potential were identiﬁed : CD34 pos CD36 neg ( 0 . 1 % ) ; CD34 pos CD36 pos ( barely detectable - 0 . 1 % ) ; CD34 neg CD36 low ( 2 % ) and CD34 neg CD36 neg ( 75 % ) . In semisolid - media , CD34 pos CD36 neg cells generated BFU - E and CFU - GM ( in a 1 : 1 ratio ) , CD34 neg CD36 neg cells mostly BFU - E ( 87 % ) and CD34 pos CD36 pos and CD34 neg CD36 low cells were not tested due to low numbers . Under HEMA conditions , CD34 pos CD36 neg , CD34 pos CD36 pos , CD34 neg CD36 low and CD34 neg CD36 neg cells generated EBs with fold - increases of ≈ 9 , 000 , 100 , 60 and 1 , respectively , and maturation times ( day with > 10 % CD36 high CD235a high cells ) of 10 – 7 days . Pyrenocytes were generated only by CD34 neg / CD36 neg cells by day 15 . These results conﬁrm that the majority of HPC in AB express CD34 but identify additional CD34 neg populations with erythroid di ﬀ erentiation potential which , based on di ﬀ erences in fold - increase and maturation times , may represent a hierarchy of HPC present in AB . 1 . Introduction Hematopoiesis is deﬁned as the orderly sequence of events that replenishes the cellular elements of the blood on a daily basis [ 1 ] . Under steady - state conditions , the bone marrow provides the microenvironmental cues that allow hemato - poietic stem cells to generate a hierarchy of cells ( the hemato - poietic progenitor cells , HPCs ) progressively more restricted in their proliferation and lineage maturation potential [ 2 ] . In addition , bone marrow contains very rare precursor cells with the potential to generate hematopoietic stem cells [ 3 ] . Human stem cell precursors and stem cells are functionally deﬁned by surrogate assays in animal models [ 4 ] , while HPCs with di ﬀ erent proliferation / maturation potential are deﬁned by semisolid cultures that model the hematopoietic process in vitro [ 5 ] . These functional in vitro assays provided the basis for the identiﬁcation and prospective isolation of a hierarchy of di ﬀ erent hematogenic populations present in bone marrow [ 6 ] . Based on number and lineage of the cells generated and of the time required for their generation , semisolid assays identify a series of HPCs : HPCs able to generate large colonies ( > 30 , 000 cells ) comprising cells of multiple lineages ( the colony - forming unit , granulocytic - erythroid - megakaryocitic - monocytic , CFU - GEMM ) by day 15 – 18 , those which generate erythroid bursts ( approximately 5 , 000 cells , burst - forming unit erythroid BFU - E ) and granu - lomonocytic colonies ( colony forming unit , granulomono - cytic , CFU - GM ) by day 12 – 15 , and ﬁnally those which generate clusters ( 50 – 200 cells ) composed only by eryth - roid ( colony - forming unit , erythroid , CFU - E ) , granulocytic ( CFU - G ) or monocytic ( CFU - M ) cells by day 8 [ 5 ] . CD34 is an antigen expressed by HPCs of all types whose expression is lost at the CFU - E level [ 5 , 6 ] . CFU - GEMM express also CD38 but do not express the α subunit of 2 Stem Cells International the interleukin - 3 ( IL - 3 ) receptor , which is acquired during the transition of these cells to BFU - E , CFU - GM , and CD45RA [ 7 , 8 ] , which is speciﬁcally expressed by BFU - E [ 5 , 6 ] . CD36 is an antibody that recognizes thrombospondin , the receptor for the malarial parasite whose expression is activated within a few hours of exposure to erythropoietin ( EPO ) [ 9 ] . Although it is conceivable that CD36 is expressed by erythroid cells of all types , how its expression is modulated during the transition from CFU - GEMM to CFU - E is not known . HPCs may egress from the bone marrow into the cir - culation [ 2 ] . However , since maturation alters the adhesion receptor proﬁle of the cells and their a ﬃ nity for the marrow niches , HPCs are released from the marrow with di ﬀ erent e ﬃ ciencies and their frequency in blood may not correspond to that of the marrow [ 10 ] . The majority of erythroid HPCs in the marrow are CFU - E , but the majority ( > 90 % ) of those in blood are BFU - E [ 11 ] . The HPCs present in adult peripheral blood ( AB ) are dis - carded during the leukoreduction process used to prepare red blood cells for transfusion . Discarded AB HPCs are used in several liquid culture systems to generate great numbers of lineage - restricted precursors to study hematopoiesis [ 12 , 13 ] . More recently , it has been realized that AB HPCs discarded in the bu ﬀ y coat from a single donation cultured in the presence of dexamethasone ( DXM ) and estradiol ( ES ) , and in addition to stem cell factor ( SCF ) , IL - 3 and EPO ( human erythroid massive ampliﬁcation , HEMA , culture ) [ 14 ] may generate erythroblasts ( EBs ) in numbers su ﬃ cient for 3 – 50 transfusions [ 15 ] , paving the way for an important area of translational medicine : production of alternative transfusion products ex vivo . Although both AB mononuclear ( MNC ) and CD34 pos cells generate great numbers of EBs in HEMA culture , the total number of erythroid cells generated by CD34 pos cells is on average 1 - log lower than that generated by MNC [ 13 ] . This observation has been ascribed to loss of HPCs with erythroid di ﬀ erentiation potential ( erythroid precursor cells , EPC ) during the CD34 selection procedure and / or to the existence of circulating CD34 neg EPC . The second hypothesis is supported by a recent report indicating that AB CD34 neg cells may di ﬀ erentiate into EBs under HEMA conditions generating more EBs than the corre - sponding CD34 pos cells [ 16 ] . The phenotype of the CD34 neg cells with erythroid potential present in AB bu ﬀ y coats is not known . The aim of our study was to further clarify the phenotype of the HPCs / EPC present in AB MNC and to evaluate their contribution to the generation of EBs under HEMA condi - tions . Flow cytometric proﬁling for CD34 and CD36 expres - sion of AB MNC followed by functional characterization ( colony - forming ability in semisolid media and fold increase in HEMA ) of the prospectively isolated populations was perfomed . The results presented indicate that CD34 / CD36 proﬁling identiﬁes a hierarchy of EPC in AB . 2 . Materials and Methods 2 . 1 . Human Subjects . Peripheral blood was collected from 10 normal adult donors at the transfusion center of “La Sapienza” University ( Rome , Italy ) according to guide - lines established by institutional ethical committees . 2 . 2 . Cell Separation . Mononuclear cells ( MNCs ) were sep - arated by centrifugation over Ficoll - Hypaque ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotec , Uppsala , Sweden ) . MNC were ﬁrst anti - genically proﬁled for CD34 / CD36 expression by standard ﬂow cytometric techniques and MNC populations with di ﬀ erent CD34 / CD36 proﬁles subsequently separated by a combination of magnetic bead separation and sorting as de - scribed in Figure 1 . For ﬂow cytometrical proﬁling , MNC were suspended in Ca 2 + / Mg 2 + - free phosphate - bu ﬀ ered sa - line , supplemented with 1 % BSA , 2 mmol / L ethylenediamine tetraacetate ( EDTA ) , and 0 . 01 % NaN3 , stained with either allophycocyanin - ( APC - ) conjugated CD36 , phycoerythrin - ( PE - ) conjugated CD14 ( monocyte di ﬀ erentiation antigen 14 antibody ) , or ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate - ( FITC - ) conjugated CD42a ( which recognize GPIb ) [ 17 ] , or appropriate isotype controls ( all from Becton Dickinson Biosciences , Franklin Lakes , NJ , USA ) and analyzed with the FACS Aria ( Becton Dickinson Biosciences ) equipped with three air - cooled and solid - state lasers ( 488 - nm , 633 - nm , and 407 - nm ) . Dead cells were excluded by SYTOX Blue ( 0 . 002 mM , Molecular Probes , Carlsband , Calif , USA ) staining . MNC were then divided into CD34 pos and CD34 neg populations using Magnetic MultiSort Microbeads ( Miltenyi Biotec , Bergisch Gladbach , Germany ) . The CD34 pos fraction was further divided into CD36 neg and CD36 pos by sorting with the FACS Aria . The CD34 neg fraction was enriched for CD36 pos and CD36 neg cells with Magnetic MultiSort Microbeads coated with CD36 . All the bead - based cell enrichments were performed as described by the manufacturer . CD36 pos cells were further divided into CD36 low and CD36 high by sorting . Whenever the cell number allowed , the puriﬁed populations were reanalyzed for purity and found > 90 % pure . Results were analyzed by BD FACSDiva Software version 5 . 0 . 3 . 2 . 3 . Colony - Forming Assay . The colony forming ability of unfractionated and sorted cells was evaluated in standard semisolid methylcellulose cultures ( 40 % , Fluka Biochemika ) stimulated with human SCF ( 10 ng / mL ) , IL - 3 ( 10 ng / mL ) , granulocyte - macrophage colony - stimulating factor ( GM - CSF , 10 ng / mL ) , granulocyte colony - stimulating factor ( G - CSF , 100 ng / mL ) and EPO ( 5 U / mL ) [ 18 ] . The cultures were incubated at 37 ◦ C in a fully humidiﬁed 5 % pCO 2 atmo - sphere and scored after 14 days for the growth of hematopoi - etic colonies . CFU - GEMM - , BFU - E - , and CFU - GM - derived colonies were recognized according to standard morpholog - ical criteria [ 18 , 19 ] . 2 . 4 . Ex Vivo Expansion of Human EBs under HEMA Con - ditions . MNC ( 10 6 cells / mL ) and prospectively isolated cells ( 5 × 10 4 cells / mL ) were cultured under HEMA conditions , as described [ 14 ] . Brieﬂy , the cultures contained Iscove’s mod - iﬁed Dulbecco’s medium ( IMDM , Lonza Group Ltd , Basel , Switzerland ) supplemented with fetal bovine serum ( FBS , Sigma - Aldrich ) ( 20 % v / v ) , detoxiﬁed human serum al - bumin ( HSA ) ( 25 % , Baxter International Inc , Deerﬁeld , Stem Cells International 3 C D 34 CD36 − 194 0 10 3 10 4 10 5 0 10 3 10 4 10 5 − 277 Summary of CD34 / CD36 proﬁling of AB MNC Phenotype Frequency A CD34 pos CD36 neg B CD34 pos CD36 pos Barely detectable - 0 . 1 % C CD34 neg CD36 low D CD34 neg CD36 high E CD34 neg CD36 neg 0 . 1 ± 0 . 05 % 2 ± 0 . 8 % 1 ± 0 . 6 % 74 . 3 ± 21 . 8 % ( a ) 0 . 1 % 12 % Monocytes A B C D E b . d .

( a ) Representative coulter plot analyses for CD36 / CD34 expression of MNC from a representative AB and summary of the frequency of the di ﬀ erent populations identiﬁed by this analyses . CD36 / CD34 proﬁling identiﬁed ﬁve populations : CD34 pos CD36 neg cells ( population A , red ) , CD34 pos CD36 pos cells ( population B , black ) , and CD34 neg CD36 neg cells ( population E , green ) . A fourth CD34 neg CD36 pos population contained numerous CD14 pos cells which are represented by monocytes ( see Figure 1 ( b ) ) . Exclusion of these CD14 pos cells from the analyses revealed two CD34 neg / CD36 pos populations which express CD36 al low ( CD34 neg CD36 pos , population C , purple ) and high ( CD34 neg CD36 high cells , population D , blue ) levels , respectively . The table on the right summarizes the mean frequency ( ± SD ) of each population among MNC obtained from 3 di ﬀ erent donors . All the results presented in this ﬁgure and in Figure 2 ( a ) are presented with the same color code . ( b ) Prospective isolation of AB MNC on the basis of CD34 / CD36 expression . MNC were ﬁrst divided in two populations enriched or deprived of CD34 pos cells by CD34 - coated magnetic bead adsorption . The CD34 pos population was further puriﬁed and divided into CD36 neg and CD36 pos cells by sorting . The CD34 beads ﬂow - through fraction ( enriched for CD34 neg cells ) was further divided into CD36 pos and CD36 neg cells by magnetic bead isolation . The cells eluted from the beads were puriﬁed by sorting on the basis of lack of expression of CD14 and low level of CD36 expression ( population C , purple ) . The CD14 neg CD36 high cells ( population D , blue ) were not isolated because expressed high levels of the megakaryocytic marker CD42a .

Whenever feasible , the prospectively isolated cells were reanalyzed for purity .

Dead cells were excluded by SYTOX Blue ( 0 . 002mM , Molecular Probes ) staining .

CD34 / CD36 proﬁling divided AB MNC into 4 populations : CD34 pos CD36 neg ( population A , 0 . 1 ± 0 . 05 % ) , CD34 pos CD36 pos ( population B , often present in barely detectable numbers but reaching in some donors a frequency of ∼ 0 . 1 % ) , CD34 neg CD36 pos ( ∼ 23 % ) and CD34 neg CD36 neg ( population E , ∼ 74 % ) ( Figure 1 ( a ) ) . CD34 neg CD36 pos cells could in turn be divided into three populations : the majority of them expressed CD14 and was , therefore , represented by monocytes ( monocytes are known to express CD36 ) [ 21 ] ( Figure 1 ( b ) ) . By dot blot distribution and CD42a staining , the remaining could be divided into two additional populations : CD34 neg CD36 low ( population C , ∼ 2 % ) , which does not express CD42a , and CD34 neg CD36 high ( population D , ∼ 1 . 0 ) , which express high levels of CD42a ( mean ﬂuorescence intensity , MFI > 15 , 000 ) ( Figure 1 ( b ) ) . 3 . 2 . Prospective Isolation of MNC Populations Based on CD34 and CD36 Expression . AB MNCs were puriﬁed on the basis of CD34 and CD36 expression by the combination of mag - netic bead enrichment and cell sorting described in Figure 1 ( b ) . First , CD34 pos cells were enriched by selection with CD34 - coated microbeads . The CD34 pos fraction ( 12 % pure by reanalyses ) was then sorted into CD34 pos cells expressing ( CD36 pos , A population ) or not ( CD36 neg , B pop - ulation ) CD36 . Approximately 75 , 000 A cells and 10 , 000 B cells were recovered from the bu ﬀ y coat of an average donation ( Table 1 ) . Population A was > 98 % pure by re - analyses while the purity of population B was not determined due to low cell recovery . Reanalyses for CD36 and CD14 expression of the ﬂow - through fraction of the CD34 - coated magnetic beads re - vealed that a great number ( ∼ 78 % ) of CD36 pos cells ex - pressed also CD14 . This ﬂow - through fraction was further divided into CD36 - enriched and CD36 - deprived fractions by CD36 - magnetic bead isolation . The cells adsorbed to the beads which did not express CD14 and CD42a and expressed CD36 at low levels were sorted ( CD34 pos CD36 low , population C ) ( Figure 1 ( b ) ) . Approximately 7 , 500 C cells were recovered from the bu ﬀ y coat of a blood donation ( Table 1 ) . This low number prevented reanalyses for purity of this cell population and limited its functional characterization . The CD14 neg CD34 neg cells which expressed CD36 at high levels 6 Stem Cells International ( CD34 neg CD36 high , population D ) was not sorted because of its high CD42a expression , which suggest that the may have been represented by megakaryocytic precursors [ 17 ] . The ﬂow - through fraction of the CD36 magnetic beads was further puriﬁed by sorting ( population E ) . A total of 10 million CD34 neg CD36 neg cells were recovered from an aver - age AB bu ﬀ y coat ( Table 1 ) . 3 . 3 . Cloning E ﬃ ciency of AB Populations Prospectively Isolated on the Basis of CD34 / CD36 Proﬁling . The progenitor cell activity in semisolid assays of population A and E is presented in Table 2 . AB MNC were analyzed in parallel as control . As expected , population A was greatly enriched for colony forming cells ( cloning e ﬃ ciency 16 % ) and generated both BFU - E - and CFU - GM - derived colonies ( in a 1 : 1 ratio ) . It also contained few ( 0 . 001 % ) CFU - GEMM . By contrast , population E had a cloning e ﬃ ciency 40 % lower than that of MNC and generated mainly ( 80 % ) erythroid bursts . No di ﬀ erence in size and morphology was observed among ery - throid bursts originated from population A and E and MNC ( insert in Table 1 ) , an indication that the BFU - E present in the di ﬀ erent fractions had similar proliferation / maturation potential . 3 . 4 . Expansion Potential under HEMA Conditions of AB Popu - lations Prospectively Isolated on the Basis of CD34 / CD36 Pro - ﬁling . The expansion potential under HEMA conditions of AB populations prospectively isolated on the basis of CD34 / CD36 proﬁling is compared in Figure 2 ( a ) and Table 1 . AB MNC were analyzed in parallel as control . As expected , under HEMA conditions , population A had great prolif - eration potential expressing FIs between 900 ( Figure 2 ( a ) ) and 24 , 000 ( average FI = 9 , 000 , Table 1 ) compared to FI < 10 of the corresponding MNC . Signiﬁcant numbers of cells were also generated by population B and C which expressed FI of 100 and 60 by day 13 ( Figure 2 ( a ) and Table 1 ) . By contrast , population E had FI as low as 1 – 3 . However , given the great numbers of cells segregating in this fraction ( > 10 7 ) , population E generated many cells ( ∼ 10 7 ) under HEMA conditions ( FI ∼ 1 ) . 3 . 5 . Maturation Potential of AB MNC Populations Prospective - ly Isolated on the Basis of CD34 / CD36 Proﬁling . The lineage and maturation stage of the progeny of AB MNC and of AB populations prospectively isolated on the basis of CD36 / CD34 proﬁling is presented in Figure 2 ( b ) . EBs maturation was deﬁned on the basis of CD36 / CD235a proﬁling which divides EBs into three populations : CD36 pos CD235a neg / low ( pro - erythroblasts ) ; CD36 pos / CD235a med / high ( basophilic erythroblasts ) , CD36 low CD235a high ( orthochromatic eryth - roblasts ) [ 5 ] . A fourth population of CD36 low CD235a low cells with low forward and side scatter is composed by pyrenocytes [ 20 ] . In cultures of MNC , cells with an immature EBs phe - notype ( CD36 pos CD235a neg ) became detectable very quickly ( 2 % by day 2 ) while non - EBs became detectable in modest numbers ( 6 - 7 % ) by day 10 . Mature EBs ( CD36 pos CD235a pos ) were detected by day 6 ( 15 % ) and reached a frequency > 70 % by day 10 . By day 15 , immature EBs became barely detectable and numerous cells with CD36 low CD235a high phenotype ( both larger cells corresponding to orthochromatic EBs , 18 % , and smaller cells corresponding to pyrenocytes , 40 % ) were detected ( Figure 2 ( b ) ) . In HEMA cultures of population A , immature EBs were also detected very early ( 10 % by day 2 ) but the frequency of mature EBs reached 10 % only by day 8 . By day 15 , the cultures contained signiﬁcant numbers ( 22 % ) of CD36 low / CD235a high orthochromatic EBs but no pyrenocytes ( Figure 2 ( b ) ) . In HEMA culture of population B , numbers of cells suf - ﬁcient for antigenic proﬁling were obtained by day 6 . CD36 pos CD235a neg cells represented the majority ( ∼ 83 % ) of the cells from day 6 to day 8 . In these cultures , mature CD36 pos CD235a pos EBs were observed at earlier time points with respect to cultures of population A ( 3 % and 10 % of CD36 pos CD235a pos cells by day 6 - 7 versus day 7 - 8 in cultures of population B and A , resp . ) ( Figure 2 ( b ) ) . By day 15 , the maturation phenotype of the progeny of population B and A was the same . HEMA cultures of population C were originally seeded with number of cells comparable to those used for pop - ulation A and B ( ∼ 7 , 500 cells with respect to 9 , 500 – 10 , 000 cells used for the two other populations ) . However , cultures of population C grew very slow ( see Figure 2 ( a ) ) and the number of cells reached values su ﬃ cient for antigenic proﬁling only by day 8 . At day 8 , great numbers ( 39 % ) of the EBs had already the mature CD36 pos / CD235a high phenotype . However , the progeny of population C progressed poorly to the orthochromatic stage and only 6 % of them had acquired the CD36 low CD235a high phenotype by day 15 . Finally , population E did not generate signiﬁcant num - bers ( 26 % ) of CD36 pos CD235a neg cells until day 6 . The cells progressed then very rapidly to the CD36 pos CD235a high stage ( 10 % CD36 pos CD235a high cells by day 7 ) and CD36 low CD235a high stage ( 7 . 5 % by day 13 ) . Pyrenocytes were detect - able in these cultures at levels similar to those observed in cultures of MNC ( 24 % ) by day 15 . In conclusion , in spite of di ﬀ erences in kinetics , all the populations analyzed in this study generated EBs under HEMA conditions . 4 . Discussion CD36 / CD34 proﬁling identiﬁes at least four populations pre - sent in AB MNC capable to generate colonies in semisolid assay and EBs under HEMA conditions . In semisolid assay , only 9 % of the original HPCs activity was recovered among the puriﬁed fractions ( 8 . 1 % in popu - lation A and 0 . 8 % in population B ) . Although the cloning e ﬃ ciency of population B and C is not known , given the low cell content of these populations ( ∼ 15 , 000 cells in total , Table 1 ) , they may contain at most 5 % of the MNC HPCs activity . Therefore , > 80 % of the HPCs activity present in the MNC was lost during the puriﬁcation procedure . This result suggests the hypothesis that some of the HPCs activity of the MNC is due to pre - HPCs cells which became HPCs in Stem Cells International 7 Table 2 : Cloning e ﬃ ciency of AB MNC and AB cell populations prospectively isolated on the basis of CD34 / CD36 expression .

Consistent with the data reported by van den Akker et al . [ 16 ] , we determined that under HEMA conditions EBs are generated both by CD34 pos and CD34 neg AB cells ( Table 1 ) . Therefore , both populations contain EPC . CD34CD36 pro - ﬁling identiﬁed that in addition to two CD34 pos EPC populations ( CD34 pos CD36 neg and CD44 pos CD36 pos ) , AB MNC contain 2 CD34 neg EPC population ( CD34 neg CD36 low and CD34 neg CD36 neg ) . The antigenic proﬁle which deﬁnes the CD34 neg CD36 neg population is still to be identiﬁed , although preliminary results indicate that these cells may express CD44 [ 22 ] , the receptor for hyaluronic acid which interacts also with osteopontin and collagen [ 23 ] ( data not shown ) . By contrast with the great loss of colony forming cells observed with the puriﬁcation of AB MNC ( Table 2 ) , the puriﬁcation procedures did not lead to great losses of EPC , as indicated by the observation that the sum of the numbers of EBs generated by the four puriﬁed fractions is only modestly ( 7 . 5 × 10 8 versus 2 . 7 × 10 9 ) lower than that generated by MNC ( Table 1 ) . Under HEMA conditions , the population which generated the greatest numbers of EBs was population A , only 27 % of which had been recovered during the puriﬁcation procedures ( Table 1 ) . Cultivation under HEMA conditions of a population A containing all the CD34 pos CD36 neg cells present in one donation ( 100 % recovery ) would generate as many as 2 . 3 × 10 9 EBs , a number very similar to that observed in cultures of MNC . These data indicate cell loss during the puriﬁcation procedure , rather than great EBs generation by CD34 neg HPCs , as the main reason for the overall greater output of EBs from MNC than from CD34 pos cells in HEMA culture . Based on FI and on the time required to mature in cul - ture , the four EPC populations identiﬁed in AB were clas - siﬁed according to the hierarchical model presented in Figure 3 . CD34 pos CD36 neg cells may represent earlier cells , probably HPCs ( they contain both BFU - E and CFU - GM ) , while CD34 pos CD36 pos and CD34 neg CD36 pos cells may rep - resents early and late erythroid restricted progenitor cells ( EPC ) , respectively . It is possible that these cell populations are linked in a mother - daughter relationship . It is di ﬃ cult to classify population E in this model . Since the majority of the cells in this population is likely represented by di ﬀ erentiated precursors , it is conceivable that the progen - itor cells represent in this fraction are a rare population with such a great proliferation potential to express FI = 1 . This hypothesis is also supported by the observation that population E was the slowest population to generate EBs ( CD36 pos CD235a pos cells were not detected before day 6 ) . It is suggested that this population may contain precursor cells which are capable to generate CD34 pos cells . Further studies involving time course analyses of the expression of CD34 among the progeny of CD34 neg CD36 neg E cells are required to clarify this important point . Since the growth factors used to stimulate HEMA culture were selected for optimal EB , and not CD34 cell , generation [ 15 ] , it is possible that preculture of CD34 neg CD36 neg E cells under conditions which promote CD34 cell proliferation ( using growth factor combinations including FLT3 ligand or thrombopoietic ) [ 24 , 25 ] , will allow generation of greater numbers of EBs when the progeny of their cells will be in turn cultured under HEMA conditions . Also intriguing is the observation that population E is the only puriﬁed populations to generate great numbers of pyrenocytes by day 15 , an indication that its progeny under - went signiﬁcant levels of enucleation in HEMA . The presence of macrophages greatly favors the enucleation process [ 26 ] . In HEMA culture , macrophages are present as contaminant in cultures of MNC which routinely generate pyrenocytes by day 15 ( Figure 1 ( b ) ) . These cells were removed by the puriﬁcation process from all the other populations which did not generate pyrenocytes by day 15 . Population E , however , although does not contain macrophages ( CD14 pos CD36 pos cells ) may contain their precursors , which may maturate in culture , favoring enucleation of EBs . Further studies are required to clarify the role of contaminating macrophages , 8 Stem Cells International C D 34 CD36 − 151 − 132 ?

See text for further details . and / or of their precursor cells , in the enucleation of human EBs generated under HEMA conditions . In conclusion , CD34 / CD36 proﬁling identiﬁes a hierar - chy of EPC in AB . Although under HEMA conditions the majority of EBs were generated by CD34 pos cells , it is possible that further improvement of the culture system by favoring proliferation of CD34 neg cells , may further increase the num - ber of EBs generated by AB .

We previously described the large - scale production of RBCs from hematopoietic stem cells ( HSCs ) of diverse sources . Our present e ﬀ orts are focused to produce RBCs thanks to an unlimited source of stem cells . Human embryonic stem ( ES ) cells or induced pluripotent stem cell ( iPS ) are the natural candidates . Even if the proof of RBCs production from these sources has been done , their ampliﬁcation ability is to date not su ﬃ cient for a transfusion application . In this work , our protocol of RBC production was applied to HSC isolated from fetal liver ( FL ) as an intermediate source between embryonic and adult stem cells . We studied the erythroid potential of FL - derived CD34 + cells . In this in vitro model , maturation that is enucleation reaches a lower level compared to adult sources as observed for embryonic or iP , but , interestingly , they ( i ) displayed a dramatic in vitro expansion ( 100 - fold more when compared to CB CD34 + ) and ( ii ) 100 % cloning e ﬃ ciency in hematopoietic progenitor assays after 3 days of erythroid induction , as compared to 10 – 15 % cloning e ﬃ ciency for adult CD34 + cells . This work supports the idea that FL remains a model of study and is not a candidate for ex vivo RBCS production for blood transfusion as a direct source of stem cells but could be helpful to understand and enhance proliferation abilities for primitive cells such as ES cells or iPS . 1 . Introduction The cell therapy approach which consists of generating cultured RBC ( cRBC ) in vitro after ampliﬁcation of stem cells ( SC ) makes sense in a context of chronic di ﬃ culties of obtaining blood supplies . More than blood supplies , hematopoietic di ﬀ erentiation of human stem cells into RBC has important therapeutic implications , including the possibility to produce virus - free units or tailor - designed phe - notypes for transfusion purposes . Our team has established an experimental procedure to reproduce in vitro terminal erythropoiesis from adult hematopoietic stem cells ( HSC ) from diverse sources ( peripheral blood ( PB ) , bone marrow ( BM ) , and cord blood ( CB ) ) [ 1 , 2 ] . This protocol , using appropriate cytokines and a speciﬁc microenvironment ( including stromal murine MS5 or Mesenchymal Stem Cells ( MSC ) ) in a serum - free medium , allows HSC prolifera - tion and terminal di ﬀ erentiation in mature and functional enucleated RBC containing adult haemoglobin [ 2 ] . Major advances have allowed towards the in vitro production of RBCs from diverse sources in a few years . Nevertheless , their transfusional future will become a reality only if we are able to produce functional transfusable RBCs at a large scale . This will of course require not only the conception of appropriate industrial tools , but also ﬁnding the best source of stem cells . To date , the most accessible and proliferative source of HSC in a quantitative aspect is cord blood ( CB ) [ 3 ] . However , this cell source is dependent on donations and ex vivo production of RBC is restricted to a system of production in batches , using the ﬁnite quantity of HSC available in a CB unit . Such are its limits . 2 Stem Cells International Consequently , our present e ﬀ orts are focused on estab - lishing conditions to produce RBC using a permanent and inexhaustible source of stem cells . Human embryonic stem cells or recently discovered induced pluripotent stem cells ( iPS ) [ 4 , 5 ] are the natural candidates . As other teams , we have shown the possibility to reconstitute in vitro eryth - ropoiesis starting from very primitive stem cells [ 6 – 13 ] , and we were the ﬁrst to report the erythroid di ﬀ erentiation and maturation of iPS lines ( from fetal and adult ﬁbroblasts ) into mature enucleated RBC ( 4 % to 10 % compared to 52 % to 66 % from human ES cell line ( H1 ) ) , which synthesized functional fetal hemoglobin [ 9 ] . The demonstration that primitive cells can be di ﬀ eren - tiated in vitro to cells similar to their natural counterpart was the ﬁrst step for a potential therapeutic application . But there is still a major problem for a hypothetical application in transfusion : their ampliﬁcation . Indeed , in our conditions , 1 ES or 1 iPS cell can generate 5000 or 1000 RBC , respectively , [ 9 ] whereas 1 CD34 + from CB can give up to 2 . 5 × 10 5 RBCs [ 2 ] . This crucial di ﬃ culty of ampliﬁcation of ES or iPS has not yet been solved by any team . Rollini et al . have demonstrated that fetal liver ( FL ) could be an alternative source of HSC despite a limited total cell number per tissue , due to their high proliferative capacity [ 14 ] . Indeed , the site of erythropoiesis migrates during development . It takes place ﬁrst in the yolk sac and the para - aortic region . Erythropoiesis then migrates to the fetal liver between the 8th and the 22nd week of gestation to ﬁnally take place in the BM [ 15 ] . In the present work we investigated the capacity of CD34 + cells isolated from human FL , an ontogenic source intermediate between very primitive cells ( ES and iPS ) and adult stem cells , to expand and di ﬀ erentiate into erythroid lineage cells . We cocultured FL - derived CD34 + cells over an in vitro reconstituted bone marrow ( BM ) microenvironment . As observed for hES or iPS , only a fraction of erythroid cells reached terminal di ﬀ erentiation into mature RBC ( 15 % ) . These few RBCs contained nearly exclusively fetal hemoglobin at the protein level . However , as compared to adult HSC , we could observe a dramatic expansion of FL - derived erythroid cells , 100 - fold higher when compared to CB CD34 + . FL is an alternative model that might be relevant to understanding mechanisms both implied in ampliﬁcation and di ﬀ erentiation of HSC in erythropoiesis and could be used as a model for other di ﬀ erentiation pathways . 2 . Materials and Methods 2 . 1 . Fetal Liver . Fetal livers were surgically obtained from 6 aborted fetuses ( after 12 – 14 weeks of amenorrhoea ) after informed consent of patients was given . All experiments and procedures were in agreement with the guidelines from the French Health ministry and the Agence de la Biom ´ edecine . FL was dissociated within less than 4 hours after collection and ﬂushed through a 70 μ m ﬁlter and preserved in a PBS / BSA 10 % ( v / v ) ( Sigma Aldrich , Lyon , France ) solution until CD34 cell immunomagnetic separation , which was performed within a maximal 1 hour delay . 2 . 2 . CD34 Cell Isolation . FL CD34 + cells were isolated by immunomagnetic separation according to the manu - facturer’s guidelines ( Miltenyi Biotech , Bergisch Gladbach , Germany ) . CD34 + purity was evaluated by ﬂow cytometry . 2 . 3 . FL - Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells ( MSCs ) . The CD34 negative fractions were used for MSC generation according to the technique described by Doucet et al . [ 16 ] . Brieﬂy , cells were plated at a density of 2 × 10 5 cells / cm 2 and cul - tured in alpha - MEM medium ( Biological Industries , ATGC Biotechnologies , Noisy le Grand , France ) supplemented with 5 % ( v / v ) platelet - enriched plasma lysate ( PL ) and 2 IU / mL heparin ( Roche Diagnostics , Basel , Switzerland ) . Cultures were fed every 3 - 4 days with fresh medium . At conﬂuence cells were replated at 6 × 10 3 / cm 2 . The grown cells had a ﬁbroblast - like morphology . After 2 passages , cells were assessed for immunophenotyping , and their phenotype corresponded to MSCs , that is , CD73 + , CD105 + , CD90 + , CD45 − . 2 . 4 . Generation of Red Blood Cells Ex Vivo . CD34 + cells were cultured in a three - step procedure in a serum - free medium as previously described [ 2 ] with some modiﬁcations such as the source of serum or the use of FL mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs ) as stroma . 2 × 10 4 CD34 + cells / mL were ﬁrst cultured in IMDM medium ( Biological Industries , ATGC Biotechnologies ) supplemented either with 1 % BSA or 1 % human AB plasma , 10 μ g / mL insulin ( Sigma ) , and 120 μ g / mL iron - saturated human transferrin ( Sigma ) . In the ﬁrst step ( days 0 – 8 ) , 2 × 10 4 / mL CD34 + cells were cultured in the presence of 10 − 6 M hydrocortisone ( Sigma ) , 100 ng / mL stem cell factor ( SCF , Peprotech , Neuilly sur Seine , France ) , 5 ng / mL IL - 3 ( R & D Systems ) , and 3 IU / mL erythropoietin ( Eprex , kindly provided by Janssen - Cilag ) . On day 4 , one volume of cell culture was diluted in four volumes of fresh medium containing hydrocortisone , SCF , IL - 3 , and erythropoietin . In the second step ( days 8 – 10 ) , the cells were replated at 5 × 10 4 / mL and cocultured on an adherent stromal layer in fresh medium supplemented with erythropoietin . In the third step ( days 10 – 18 ) , cells were cultured on an adherent stromal layer in fresh medium without cytokines . The cultures were maintained at 37 ◦ C in 5 % CO 2 . The adherent cell layer consisted of either the MS - 5 stromal cell line ( provided by K . Mori ) or fetal mesenchymal stromal cells ( MSCs ) established from the CD34 negative fraction of FL liver samples . 2 . 5 . Colony Assay . Colony - Forming Unit Granulocyte Ma - crophage ( CFU - GM ) , Colony - Forming Unit Erythroid cells ( CFU - E ) , Burst - Forming Unit Erythroid cells ( BFU - E ) and Colony - Forming Unit Mix ( CFU - Mix ) were assayed in a semisolid methylcellulose medium as previously described [ 17 ] . 2 . 6 . Flow Cytometry Analyses . All immunophenotyping analyses were performed using a FACScalibur ﬂow cytome - ter ( Becton Dickinson , Franklin Lakes , NJ , USA ) using CellQuest Pro software . Immunophenotyping of fetal Stem Cells International 3 MSCs was carried out with the following antibodies : FITC - conjugated anti - CD45 ( Beckman Coulter , Imunotech , Roissy en France , France ) , anti - CD105 ( Serotec , Cergy Saint Christophe , France ) , PE - conjugated anti - CD90 , and anti - CD73 ( Pharmingen - Becton Dickinson Franklin Lakes , USA ) . Immunophenotyping of fetal RBCs was carried out with the following antibodies : FITC - conjugated anti - CD36 and PE - conjugated anti - CD71 ( Beckman Coulter , Imunotech ) . Immunophenotyping of fetal mononuclear cells was carried out with the following antibodies : FITC - conjugated anti - CD38 ( DAKO , Glostrup , Denmark ) , anti - Glycophorin A , anti - CD36 , anti - CD71 , anti - CD45 , PE - conjugated anti - CD117 , anti - CD33 , anti - CD34 , anti - CD2 , anti - CD3 , anti - CD8 , ( Beckman Coulter - Imunotech ) , anti - CD19 , anti - CD4 , anti - CD14 , and anti - CD56 ( Becton Dick - inson ) . Appropriate negative controls ( mouse anti - human irrelevant control ) were performed for each FACS analysis . 2 . 7 . Cells and Hemoglobin Characterisation Hematological Staining . Cell di ﬀ erentiation was monitored throughout culture by morphological analysis of the cells after cytocentrifugation and May - Gr¨unwald - Giemsa ( MGG ) staining . Hemoglobin Analysis . The pattern of hemoglobin ( Hb ) syn - thesis was analyzed by high - performance liquid chromatog - raphy ( HPLC ) ( Biorad variant II , BioRad Laboratories , Munich , Germany ) with a high - resolution betathalassemia program . 2 . 8 . Semiquantitative Real - Time Reverse Transcriptase - Polymerase Chain Reaction ( RT - PCR ) . Using the protocol of erythroid di ﬀ erentiation described above , we generated RBCs from CD34 + cells isolated from di ﬀ erent ontogenic sources ( i . e . , from CB , BM , and FL ) in order to compare the kinetics of the transcriptomic proﬁle of genes known to be involved in erythroid di ﬀ erentiation ( GATA - 1 , FOG 1 , SOX6 , GFI 1b , STAT5a , FOXO3a , and α , β , γ , ε , ζ globin chains ) . Total RNA was prepared from cells collected at di ﬀ erent times of RBCs culture ( days 8 , 11 , 15 , 18 ) . RNA was extracted using the Trizol method according to the manufacturer’s instructions ( Invitrogen , Paisley , Scotland ) . 1 μ g of DNase - treated RNA was transcribed into cDNA using 200 units of SuperScript II reverse transcriptase ( Invitrogen ) and 150 ng of random primers ( Invitrogen ) . The resulting cDNA was aliquoted to avoid repeat freeze / thaw cycles . Real - time PCR was performed using an ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System ( Applied Biosystems , Foster City , Calif , USA ) . The 18S gene was used as an internal reference . All primers and probes were from Applied Biosystems . Other genes were ampliﬁed using SYBRgreen chemistry , and the GAPDH gene was used as an internal reference . All primers were from Eurogentech ( Liege , Belgium ) . For both chemistries , PCR were performed in duplicate using either the TaqMan Master Mix or SYBR green Master Mix with 10 ng of cDNA and 300 nM of primers in a ﬁnal Table 1 : Flow cytometric analysis of fetal liver cells before CD34 + immunomagnetic separation . Fetal liver was dissociated , and the mononuclear cells were isolated by density - gradient centrifugation and analyzed by ﬂow cytometry for di ﬀ erent cell surface markers . Results are presented as the percentage of positive cells . CD : cluster of di ﬀ erentiation .

After 2 minutes incubation at 50 ◦ C , the AmpliTaq Gold was activated by 10 - minute incubation at 95 ◦ C . A total of 40 ampliﬁcation cycles were run with an annealing temperature of 60 ◦ C . Calibration curves were established to check that PCR e ﬃ ciency was similar for all target genes and references . The relative expression of a given target gene was given by the 2 − ΔΔ Ct method [ 18 ] , where ΔΔ Ct represents the di ﬀ erence of an unknown sample ( days 8 , 11 , 15 , 18 of culture ) versus a control ( day 0 of culture ) for a target gene normalized to a control gene ( 18S or GAPDH ) . This calculation method is suitable for investigating physiological changes in gene expression levels . 3 . Results Starting from FL - derived CD34 + cells , we used a three - step stimulation protocol . Firstly , cell proliferation and erythroid di ﬀ erentiation were induced with stem cell factor ( SCF ) , interleukin - 3 ( IL3 ) , and erythropoietin ( Epo ) . Secondly , the cells were cocultured with additional Epo alone on an in vitro reconstituted BM microenvironment ( human fetal MSC or murine MS5 stromal cell line ) . In the third step , all exogenous factors were withdrawn , and the cells were incubated on the stroma alone . 3 . 1 . Massive Expansion and Commitment of Human Erythroid Cells from FL - Derived CD34 + Cells . In the starting FL population , smear examination showed that a majority of cells belonged to the erythroid lineage , more than 50 % being proerythroblasts . As analyzed by ﬂow cytometry , most cells expressed markers of the erythroid lineage ( 69 % double positive for CD235a / CD36 and 74 % for CD235a / CD71 ) , and 22 ± 2 . 8 % were CD34 + / CD38 − HSC . Other cells belonged to the myeloid lineage while no lymphoid B or T cells were detected ( Table 1 ) . After CD34 + immunomagnetic separation , we obtained a purity of over 90 % . The three - step protocol resulted in a dramatic ampliﬁcation of CD34 + 4 Stem Cells International D0 D8 D11 D15 D18 10 6 10 5 10 4 10 3 10 2 10 1 10 0 FLCBBM Days of culture C e ll s e x p a n s i o n ( f o l d ) Figure 1 : Ampliﬁcation of CD34 + FL cells during erythroid di ﬀ erentiation . CD34 + hematopoietic stem cells from fetal liver ( FL ) were grown in liquid culture according to the three - step protocol described in Section 2 , and total cells were counted at the indicated times . Mean values with the standard deviation for three experiments are shown , and the results are compared to those for ampliﬁcation of cells from cord blood ( CB ) and bone marrow ( BM ) . stem cells by 1 . 2 ± 0 . 3 × 10 6 - fold ( mean of six di ﬀ erent liver samples ) by day 18 . This ampliﬁcation represents 1 or 2 logs higher expansion as compared to CB ( 8 × 10 4 ± 2 × 10 4 - fold , n = 3 ) and BM ( 2 . 6 × 10 4 ± 0 . 8 × 10 4 - fold , n = 3 ) cells , respectively , ( Figure 1 ) . The development of a large and almost pure erythroid cell population can probably be attributed to the preferential proliferation of the generated erythroid progenitors and their subsequent di ﬀ erentiation and maturation . On day 3 , 100 % of the cells were clonogenic , most belonging to the erythroid lineage ( 44 % BFU - E , 7 % CFU - E , 33 % CFU - GM and 16 % CFU - mix ) . On day 8 , 5 % of the cells were clonogenic , 90 % of these being BFU - Es . Late erythroid CFU - E progenitors proliferated extensively and constituted 57 % of the clonogenic cell population by day 10 ( Figure 2 ) . Cells in culture lost their immaturity as early as day 8 as assessed by CD34 , CD117 , and CD33 negativity , while their erythroid commitment was conﬁrmed by CD235a , CD71 , and CD36 positivity . Day 18 cultured RBCs were CD235a + . These cells still expressed CD36 and CD71 markers , as was also observed in our model using CB and BM sources ( Figure 3 ( a ) ) . On an MS5 stromal layer , FL CD34 + cells displayed the same erythroid maturation kinetics as CD34 + cells from other sources ( CB , BM , or peripheral blood , data not shown ) up to day 15 . However , their erythroid maturation was blocked by day 18 at the acidophilic stage , and very little nucleus expulsion was observed ( 3 to 15 % ) ( Figure 3 ( b ) ) . On the hypothesis that a fetal microenvironment would provide a more suitable niche to achieve complete maturation , we established cocultures over autologous or allogeneic MSCs grown from the FL CD34 negative fractions , but with no Type of colony BFU - E CFU - E CFU - GM Mix ( CFU - GM + BFU - E ) Total Day of culture D8 D3 D10 228 32 167 91 518 100 18 22 14 154 20 31 3 2 56 Day 3 Day 8 Day 10 110 90 70 50 30 10 − 10 CFU - GM CFU - Mix CFU - E BFU - E C l o n i n g e c i e n c y Figure 2 : Colony formation of FL - derived erythroid cells .

Hemoglobin Analysis of FL - Derived Erythroid Cells . Quantitative real - time PCR analysis of total RNA at di ﬀ erent times of culture ( days 8 , 11 , 15 , and 18 ) showed that , except for the β globin gene whose expression is constant regardless of the stage of the culture , the expression level of mRNA coding for the other globin genes is upregulated during the erythroid di ﬀ erentiation process . More particularly , the globin gene expression of the FL - derived erythroid cells showed to be mainly embryonic ( ζ and ε globin chains ) and fetal ( γ globin chains ) . No adult β globin gene expression could be detected .

On day 8 , the cells contained 68 % ( 59 – 77 % ) fetal hemoglobin ( HbF ) including an acetylated fraction . A very early migrating subfraction was detected and could be identiﬁed as Bart Hb , which corresponds to the association of four γ globin chains . At the end of culture ( days 19 – 24 ) , 86 % ( 80 – 89 % ) of the cells contained HbF and less than 2 % ( 1 . 2 – 1 . 8 % ) adult HbA ( Figure 4 ( b ) ) . 6 Stem Cells International α chain α chain β chain ε chain ζ chain γ chain 2 − ΔΔ C t 2 − ΔΔ C t Days of culture Bone marrow Cord blood Fetal liver Bone marrow Cord blood Fetal liver 10000 1000 100 10 1 2 − ΔΔ C t 2 − ΔΔ C t 2 − ΔΔ C t 2 − ΔΔ C t 10000 1000 100 10 1 1000 100 10 1 8 11 15 18 Days of culture 8 11 15 18 Days of culture 8 11 15 18 Days of culture 8 11 15 18 Days of culture 8 11 15 18 Days of culture 8 11 15 18 10 1 0 . 1 0 . 01 0 . 001 10 1 0 . 1 0 . 01 0 . 001 0 . 0001 10 5 10 3 10 1 10 − 1 10 − 3 10 − 5 10 − 7 10 − 9 ( a ) 100 80 60 40 20 0 T y p e o f h e m o g l o b i n ( % ) D8 – D10 D16 D19 – D24 Days of culture Hb Bart HbF HbAHbA2 33 % 22 % 12 % 0 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 Acetylated HbF Hb Bart HbF HbA ( b ) Figure 4 : Analysis of the hemoglobin produced by FL - derived erythroid cells .

In an attempt to explain the blockage at the acidophilic stage of the FL - derived erythroid cells , we analyzed the expression pattern of factors known to be involved in deﬁnitive erythropoiesis . We compared PCR results with those obtained for BM and CB samples taken at the same time of erythroid culture ( days 8 , 11 , 15 , 18 ) . The 2 − ΔΔ Ct method was applied to establish relative expression of genes ( Figure 5 ) . As compared to BM or CB samples , RT - PCR revealed a strong downregulation of all genes for FL - derived cells regardless of the stage of the culture . BM and CB had the same expression pattern of factors except for STAT5a factor ( for which CB showed the same proﬁle as FL ) . We also observed that the levels of gene expression were higher for BM than for CB . 4 . Discussion A large variety of ontogenic sources of HSC have been explored for cellular therapies . Because of constantly increas - ing demand in blood supplies , one particular ﬁeld of interest is transfusion . Thus , we and others have described experimental procedures which allow the massive expansion of CD34 + cells from various sources and the generation of mature RBCs [ 1 , 2 , 19 – 22 ] . To date , the most proliferative and accessible source of stem cells for generating cultured RBCs ( cRBCs ) is cord blood . It presents , nevertheless , the drawbacks of being restricted to voluntary donations and is not unlimited ; 1 CB unit gives one batch of cRBC production . Because they are an unlimited source of stem cells , many studies are being carried out with ES cells and more recently with iPS . Critical advances have allowed progress towards the in vitro production of functional RBC from these sources in a few years . However their limited ability to expand in vitro is a limitation to large - scale production . In human development , FL is a rich source of hematopoi - etic progenitors between the 8th and the 22nd week of gestation as it is the exclusive site of erythropoiesis . Although “conventional” sources of HSC for generating cRBC include both adult ( mobilized peripheral blood or CB ) and primitive stem cells ( ES or iPS cells ) , evidence suggests that FL may represent a rich alternative source of “early” HSCs , displaying multipotency , possessing high proliferative and repopulating potential [ 23 – 26 ] . Indeed , it has been proven to be e ﬃ cient in transplantation [ 27 – 29 ] . In the present work , we addressed the question of the possibility of generating in vitro mature cells from HSC of such an intermediate ontogenic source ( FL cells ) between ES cells and adult cells . In our experimental conditions , FL cell maturation is mainly blocked at the acidophilic stage . Indeed , only few cells ( 3 – 15 % ) achieved terminal di ﬀ erentiation . We made the hypothesis that the blockade of maturation observed in vitro was the consequence of an inappropriate microenvironment . On the assumption that a microenvironment from the same ontogenic stage would better support erythroid di ﬀ erentiation , we cocultured FL - derived CD34 + cells on FL - derived MSC instead of the murine MS5 stromal cell line . However , no di ﬀ erence was observed in terms of terminal maturation , and the produced cells were mostly nucleated , whereas in the same culture conditions adult stem cells could generate fully enucleated cRBC . When we analyzed by RT - PCR globin transcripts of FL - derived erythroid cells , the transcriptomic proﬁles were mainly fetal ( γ - globin chains ) and embryonic ( ζ - and ε - globin chains ) . In the same way , BM - derived erythroid cells showed an adult globin proﬁle as they mainly expressed β - globin chain and to lesser extent fetal chains ( α - , γ - globin chains ) . No embryonic genes ( ζ - and ε - globin chains ) could be detected . In comparison , CB - derived erythroid cells showed a similar gene proﬁle but had a stronger expression of the fetal γ - globin chains and embryonic genes ( ζ - and ε - globin chains ) could be detected but with a variable and low expression . By analyzing the globin genes expression , we could observe that our system of culture mimics what happens during development and leads to globin gene expression patterns in accordance with the cells’ ontogeny . The precise molecular mechanisms that regulate the ery - throid di ﬀ erentiation process remain to be fully elucidated despite many genes and pathways have been described to be essential in erythropoiesis . In order to understand the reason for the enucleation deﬁciency observed with FL cells , we analyzed by RT - PCR the expression of some genes known to be involved in deﬁnitive erythropoiesis ( i . e . , GATA - 1 , FOG 1 , SOX6 , GFI 1b , STAT5a , FOXO3a ) upon the following ratio - nale . GATA - 1 is found exclusively in hematopoietic cells and is particularly important in erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages . In vitro , in the absence of GATA - 1 , a maturation deﬁcit can be observed , indicating its crucial role in terminal erythroid di ﬀ erentiation [ 30 ] . FOG - 1 - null embryos present a defect both in primitive and deﬁnitive erythropoiesis with a blockage of maturation at the stage of proerythroblast [ 31 ] . The signal transducer and activator of transcription STAT5 is responsible for the control of proliferation , di ﬀ er - entiation , and apoptosis , via its e ﬀ ect on gene expression . STAT5 proteins [ 32 ] are suggested to play an important role in hematopoiesis , but there are numerous contradictory reports on the role of STAT5 in normal hematopoietic cell development . A recent study [ 33 ] shows that overexpression of an activated mutant of ( STAT5 ) induces erythropoiesis and increases long - term proliferation of human hematopoi - etic stem / progenitor cells . siRNA silencing of FOXO3a as well as the inactivation of GFI 1b led to erythroid di ﬀ erentiation blockage [ 34 , 35 ] . Finally , it has been reported that , in CD34 + from CB , SOX6 accelerated the kinetics of erythroid maturation and increased the number of cells that reached the ﬁnal enucleation step [ 36 ] . Our results clearly show that , in our culture conditions , all the genes we studied are strongly downregulated in FL cells , whereas they are upregulated both in BM and CB cells , notably in BM cells . The pattern of gene expression that we observed was in concordance with the enucleation defect observed in FL but could not fully explain it . Indeed this molecular analysis is qualitative and not functional . Nevertheless , it suggests that genes involved in terminal di ﬀ erentiation are di ﬀ erently regulated in the function of the cell ontogeny and might at least in part explain the 8 Stem Cells International 2 − ΔΔ C t 2 − ΔΔ C t Days of culture Bone marrow Cord blood Fetal liver FOXO3a FOG 1 GFI 1b GATA - 1 SOX6 Stat 5a 10000 1000 100 10 1 1 1 0 . 1 0 . 01 0 . 001 0 . 0001 0 . 00001 2 − Δ Δ C t 1000 100 10 0 . 1 0 . 01 0 . 001 0 . 0001 0 . 00001 1 2 − ΔΔ C t 100 10 0 . 1 0 . 01 0 . 001 0 . 0001 0 . 00001 1000 100 10 0 . 1 0 . 01 0 . 001 0 . 0001 0 . 00001 2 − Δ Δ C t 2 − ΔΔ C t 100 10 0 . 1 0 . 01 0 . 001 0 . 0001 0 . 00001 8 11 15 18 Days of culture 8 11 15 18 Days of culture 8 11 15 18 Days of culture 8 11 15 18 Days of culture 8 11 15 18 Days of culture 8 11 15 18 10 1 0 . 1 0 . 01 0 . 001 0 . 0001 0 . 00001 Bone marrow Cord blood Fetal liver 1 Figure 5 : Gene expression of factors involved in deﬁnitive erythropoiesis . Quantitative real - time PCR analysis of genes known to be implied in deﬁnitive erythropoiesis at di ﬀ erent times of culture ( days 8 , 11 , 15 , and 18 ) . Relative gene expression is given by the 2 − ΔΔ Ct method where ΔΔ Ct represents the di ﬀ erence of an unknown sample ( days 8 , 11 , 15 , and 18 of culture ) versus a control ( day 0 of culture ) for a target gene normalized to a control gene ( GAPDH ) . di ﬀ erences observed in the ability to generate RBC in vitro . For many reasons , ES or iPS cells would be the natural candidates for the regenerative medicine of tomorrow . Through this model of erythropoiesis , one can understand how di ﬀ erent cells behave according to their ontogeny . As it is titled in the publication of Williams et al . “Children are not little adults : just ask their hematopoietic stem cells” [ 37 ] . Extensive analysis on models explaining these di ﬀ erences would be of great interest to fully control the di ﬀ erentiation pathway of stem cells and would be helpful for the next generation of stem cell therapy . Even if the generation of RBCs from ES cells or iPS has been quite routinely achieved by several teams [ 6 – 13 ] , none succeeded in a 100 % enucleated population whatever the culture conditions . Primitive cells seem to underperform in terms of production yield of fully mature cRBCs in vitro . The question whether this is due to their ontogeny or related to inappropriate culture conditions remains open . If FL has no advantage in terms of ﬁnal maturation over pluripotent stem cells , we observed an interest in terms of ampliﬁcation . As far as the hematopoietic pathway is concerned , FL is known to contain a compartment of Stem Cells International 9 colony - forming cells with a high proliferative potential [ 14 , 23 – 25 ] . These observations were conﬁrmed by our ﬁndings of ( i ) a strong expansion of CD34 + FL cells and ( ii ) 100 % cloning e ﬃ ciency in hematopoietic progenitor assays after 3 days of erythroid induction , as compared to 10 – 15 % cloning e ﬃ ciency for adult CD34 + cells [ 17 ] . The proliferation capac - ity of stem cells from various sources is partly related to their ontogenic origin . ontogeny - related changes in proliferative potential of human hematopoietic cells in vitro have already been suggested in the literature , and analyses have shown , by comparing bone marrow , peripheral blood , umbilical cord blood , and fetal liver , that FL appears to represent a good target for ex vivo stem cell expansion [ 38 , 39 ] . We reproduced this observation in our culture con - ditions . Indeed , we observed a 100 , 000 - and 25 , 000 - fold expansion for cells from CB , BM , respectively . Strikingly , for FL - derived CD34 + cells , in the same culture conditions , the expansion reached more than 1 . 2 × 10 6 - fold . FL remains a model of study and is not a candidate as a direct source of stem cells for ex vivo RBCs production for blood transfusion . On the contrary , because iPS cells can proliferate indeﬁnitely , they are obviously the best candidate to set up complementary sources of RBCs for transfusion . But their clinical application will need a drastic increase of their ability to proliferate in vitro . The present observations relating to erythropoiesis from FL could pave the way for the design of new strategies to generate induced pluripotent stem cells . This idea is supported by the work of Kim et al . [ 40 ] . In a murine model , these authors observed that iPS harbor residual methylation signatures of their somatic tissue of origin , which favors their di ﬀ erentiation into lineages related to the donor cells while restricting alternative cell fates . According to this logic , we could imagine that a cell with a high proliferative capacity thereby would be optimal for the production of RBC .

Although ex vivo expanded T cells are currently widely used in pre - clinical and clinical trials , the complexity of manufacture remains a major impediment for broader application . In this review we discuss current protocols for the ex vivo expansion of virus - and tumor - speciﬁc T cells and describe our experience in manufacture optimization using a gas - permeable static culture ﬂask ( G - Rex ) . This innovative device has revolutionized the manufacture process by allowing us to increase cell yields while decreasing the frequency of cell manipulation and in vitro culture time . It is now being used in good manufacturing practice ( GMP ) facilities for clinical cell production in our institution as well as many others in the US and worldwide . 1 . Introduction—T Cell Transfer Cell therapy is a new but rapidly expanding ﬁeld in biotech - nology which involves the administration of autologous or allogeneic cells that carry out a therapeutic e ﬀ ect in vivo . The ﬁrst adoptive T cell transfer protocols in the allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant ( HSCT ) setting were based on the premise that donor peripheral blood contained T cells able to mediate antitumor and / or antiviral activity in the HSCT recipient . Accordingly , donor lymphocyte infusions ( DLIs ) have been extensively used to provide both antitumor and antiviral immunity . However , the relatively high frequency of alloreactive cells compared with virus - and / or tumor - speciﬁc T cells results in a signiﬁcant incidence of graft - versus - host disease ( GvHD ) , thereby limiting the applicability of this approach . Infusion of enriched antigen - speciﬁc T cells with reactivity against a particular antigen potentially increases therapeutic potency while decreasing undesired “o ﬀ - target” e ﬀ ects or GvHD , and this ﬁeld has grown over the past two decades . This paper focuses on the production of in vitro expanded antigen - speciﬁc T cells , dis - cusses conventional and current technologies for T cell gen - eration , and outlines recent advances in cell production tech - niques which may ultimately move this therapeutic modality from a boutique application towards a “standard of care . ” 2 . Infusion of ExVivo Expanded CTL The infusion of in vitro expanded donor - derived virus - directed cytotoxic T lymphocytes ( CTLs ) targeting one ( Epstein - Barr virus ( EBV ) ) , two ( EBV and Adenovirus ( Adv ) ) , or three viruses ( EBV , Adv , cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) ) has proven to be safe , e ﬀ ective , and protective in vivo [ 1 – 4 ] . The adoptive transfer of tumor antigen - directed T cells has also induced objective tumor responses and complete remissions in patients with advanced lymphoma , melanoma , and nasopharyngeal carcinoma [ 5 – 10 ] . Recent advances in molecular biology techniques have increased the enthusiasm for this therapeutic modality by ( 1 ) allowing the genetic modiﬁcation of T cells with a wide range of genes which confer new antigen speciﬁcity by transferring T cell receptors ( TCRs ) or chimeric antigen receptors ( CARs ) [ 11 – 14 ] , ( 2 ) improving the homing and proliferative properties of e ﬀ ector cells [ 15 , 16 ] , and ( 3 ) controlling unwanted T cell proliferation or in vivo activity [ 12 , 17 – 20 ] . Although the administration of in vitro expanded anti - gen - speciﬁc CTLs has produced promising clinical results , there are several factors limiting the extension of this approach beyond the research arena . A major practical constraint is the current complexity associated with produc - tion of large number of cells using traditional manufacture 2 Stem Cells International PBMCs CTLs Day 0 Day 9 Day 16 Low frequency of antigen speciﬁc CTL High frequency of antigen speciﬁc CTL ( a ) 0 . 8 % Q A K CD8 - FITC 27 . 9 % 48 . 7 % Day 0 Day 9 Day 16 ( b ) Antigen speciﬁcity Alloreactivity ( c ) Figure 1 : Increased frequency of antigen - speciﬁc CTLs after in vitro stimulation .

( c ) illustrates the inverse correlation between the frequency of antigen - speciﬁc and alloreactive T cells in peripheral blood ( left ) and in vitro expanded CTLs ( right ) . protocols . However , some recent advancements streamlined the production process . 3 . Exvivo Expansion of Antigen - Speciﬁc T Cells The ex vivo generation of antigen - speciﬁc T cells is conven - tionally accomplished by repeat in vitro stimulation with professional or artiﬁcial antigen presenting cells ( APCs ) which express the protein or peptide of interest and culture in the presence of cytokines which promote T cell proliferation , such as interleukin - ( IL - ) 2 [ 1 , 21 , 22 ] . This process results in the ampliﬁcation and enrichment of T cells directed against the stimulating antigen / peptide with a corresponding decrease in the frequency of cells with undesired speciﬁcities such as alloreactive T cells ( Figure 1 ) . Once su ﬃ cient cells ( required for adoptive transfer ) are generated , these are then tested for potency , purity , identity , and sterility prior to infusion . For example , EBV - speciﬁc CTLs can be expanded ex vivo from EBV - speciﬁc T cell precursors generally present at a frequency of up to 1 % in the peripheral blood of most seropositive individuals . Traditionally , enriched T cell lines are prepared by coculturing 1 × 10 6 peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) per cm 2 with gamma - irradiated ( 40 Gy ) autologous EBV - transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines ( EBV - LCLs ) at a 40 : 1 ratio ( PBMC : LCLs ) in a total volume / well ( of a tissue culture treated 24 - well plate ) of 2 mL CTL growth media ( RPMI 1640 supplemented with 45 % Click medium ( Irvine Scientiﬁc , Santa Ana , Calif ) , 2 mM GlutaMAX - I , and 10 % FBS ) . Between days 9 and 12 CTLs are harvested , counted , resuspended in fresh media , re - seeded at 5 × 10 6 per cm 2 in a total volume of 2 mL of CTL media , and then fed with recombinant IL - 2 ( 50 U / mL ) 4 days later . This initial 13 – 16 - day culture period in the absence of exogenous cytokines gives a proliferative / survival advantage to the small population of EBV - speciﬁc T cells present in PBMCs , which both produce and use IL - 2 in an autocrine manner upon stimulation with EBV - LCL . However , at later time points , when cultures are exclusively EBV speciﬁc the level of avail - able cytokine becomes limiting and thus cultures must be supplemented to ensure that CTL proliferation is adequately supported [ 23 ] . Subsequent stimulations are performed every 7 days using a 4 : 1 CTL : EBV - LCL ratio with twice weekly addition of IL - 2 ( 50 U / mL ) . This ex vivo propagation of EBV - speciﬁc T cells continues until su ﬃ cient cells are generated for cryopreservation and quality control analysis including HLA typing to conﬁrm identity , purity , and safety testing . All products must meet the speciﬁed release criteria before they are released for infusion . Additional analysis on speciﬁc products such as assessment of transgene expression may also be performed . For example , one of the release criteria for chimeric - antigen - receptor - ( CAR - ) modiﬁed EBV - CTLs is that at least 15 % of cells must express the transgene . Though there are di ﬀ erent CTL generation protocols used by di ﬀ erent groups , even for the generation of the “same” product , the component parts / core requirements ( antigen , APC , and cytokine ) are essentially the same . 4 . Traditional invitro Culture of Antigen - Speciﬁc T cells A large variety of manufacturing protocols have been described for the in vitro expansion of T cells . Small numbers of suspension cells ( < 5 × 10 7 ) can be relatively easily propagated using conventional multiwell tissue culture treated plates or ﬂasks . However , when the number of cells required exceeds the maximum capacity of a single plate or ﬂask ( e . g . , > 5 × 10 7 ) this platform becomes time consuming and cumbersome to manipulate . Cell propagation in vitro is limited by requirements for nutrients and oxygen ( O 2 ) and by the accumulation of metabolic waste such as lactic acid and carbon dioxide ( CO 2 ) . Cell culture in conventional cultureware is restricted to the use of speciﬁc media volumes per surface area unit , that is , a maximum of 1 mL media should be added per cm 2 since this is permissive to gas di ﬀ usion . However , this shallow Stem Cells International 3 media volume limits both the available nutrients and the bu ﬀ ering capacity of the media . In addition , as cell num - bers increase , O 2 and nutrient requirements progressively increase , so that cultures must be fed and re - seeded regularly . These frequent medium changes and cell manipulations are time consuming and expensive , reduce the reproducibility of cell production , and increase the risk of contamination . 5 . Alternative Vessels for T Cell Expansion One way to overcome the limitations associated with scale - up using conventional cultureware is to instead utilize a cell bioreactor that provides mechanical rocking or stirring to perfuse media with gas . The use of such bioreactors augments cell expansion , resulting in higher cell densities beyond that attained using conventional plasticware . A large number of bioreactors ( hollow ﬁber bioreactors , stirred tank bioreactors , and WAVE bioreactors ) have been explored for the expansion of suspension cells such as activated T cells , genetically modiﬁed T cells , or antigen - speciﬁc CTL [ 23 – 27 ] . In these bioreactors oxygen is provided by mechanical rocking or stirring or by pumping gas through the culture while medium can be exchanged by perfusion . Stirred bioreactors allow excellent gas exchange and can be scaled up relatively easy . However , shear stress associated with the stirring rate adversely a ﬀ ects cell viability and thus it has not been broadly adapted [ 28 ] . In contrast , hollow ﬁber bioreactors allow a constant perfusion of the culture , thus diluting metabolites without shear stress . However , accessibility to this device makes it di ﬃ cult to e ﬃ ciently recover the expanded cells [ 24 ] . Static culture bags limit the achieved cell densities ( per input media volume ) . Thus , the generation of large cell numbers requires the use of large media volumes with a resultant increase in the frequency of manipulations required to obtain the ﬁnal product [ 29 ] . Although the WAVE Bioreactor has been e ﬀ ectively adapted for the expansion of primary T cells , resulting in the generation of large numbers of cells ( 10 15 ) , the culture bag cannot be accommodated in a standard incubator and must be heated and rocked in an expensive , custom - made device [ 30 , 31 ] . In addition , optimal cell growth is maintained by regular measurement of oxygen and lactic acid and a peristaltic pump is needed to move medium in and out of the bag , necessitating the incorporation of special ﬁlters to prevent cells being damaged by the pump . Further , gas is propelled through the culture using a control ﬂow meter which ensures that culture osmolarity is maintained . Although antigen nonspeciﬁc T cell cultures have been grown with some success in these various bioreactors , antigen - speciﬁc T cells have strict requirements for cell - to - cell contact and have proven di ﬃ cult to consistently adapt to moving cultures . Therefore many groups , including our own , have found it di ﬃ cult to improve upon results achieved using the 2 cm 2 wells of standard tissue culture - treated 24 - well plates , which are ideal for the expansion of small numbers of cells required for preclinical and proof of concept studies but limit the translation of antigen - speciﬁc T - cell - based therapies beyond the academic level ( Figure 2 ) . Table 1 C e ll n u m b e r s Bioreactor cultures Cost / procedure complexity static cultures Multiwell plates , ﬂasks Figure 2 : Increased cost and procedure complexity with large - scale cell requirements . As illustrated multiwell plates or ﬂasks are ideal for the expansion of small numbers of antigen - speciﬁc CTLs ( < 5 × 10 7 ) . However , this system becomes ine ﬀ ective for the expansion of large numbers of cells . In contrast cell bioreactors are ideal for the production of large cell numbers , but this platform is di ﬃ cult to adapt and requires specialized equipment .

This dynamic interac - tion between the optimization and the preclinical phase allows for easy transition of a cell product into the cGMP . shows the relative advantages and disadvantages associated with each of the culture vessels which have been used to produce T cell products for clinical applications . 6 . Dynamic Bioprocess Optimization The problem with most manufacturing processes is the misconception that a product can be produced on a large scale by simply using a linear scale - up model . In most cases this is simply not feasible given that the production protocols are , for the most part , specialized , highly complicated , and convoluted . One way to overcome this scale - up problem , which is a bottleneck in conventional cellular therapies , is to incorporate bioprocess optimization in the manufacturing process . That will ultimately pave the way for an easy transition into the GMP and will almost guarantee manufacturing success , thus positively impacting the outcome of a clinical study . This bioprocess optimization ( as illustrated in Figure 3 ) should not be considered 4 Stem Cells International Table 1 : Suitability and properties of di ﬀ erent culture vessels for T cell expansion .

Our Experience One example of manufacture optimization that we have undertaken over the past 4 years at the Center for Cell and Gene Therapy ( CAGT ) at Baylor College of Medicine and supported by Production Assistance for Cellular Therapies ( PACT ) surrounds our search for simpler and more rapid strategies to expand antigen - speciﬁc T cells for adoptive transfer . Traditionally our group and others have cultured virus - and tumor - directed T cells in 2 cm 2 wells of tissue culture treated 24 - well plates . These T cells are often propagated for 8 weeks or longer to achieve the cell numbers required for clinical application . However , the restricted media ratio ( 1 mL / cm 2 ) associated with gas di ﬀ usion limits the supply of nutrients , which are rapidly consumed by proliferating T cells . Consequent acidic pH and waste build - up rapidly impedes cell growth and survival . Therefore , the only alternative for cell propagation is frequent reseeding and medium exchange which increases the frequency of manip - ulation required with a concomitant increase in the risk of contamination . Thus , we sought to optimize our antigen - speciﬁc T cell culture process which led us to evaluate a novel cell culture device ( gas - permeable cultureware ( G - Rex ) ) , developed by Wilson Wolf Manufacturing , and in which O 2 and CO 2 are exchanged across a silicone membrane at the base of the ﬂask . Because gas exchange occurs from below this allows an increased depth of medium above , which provides more nutrients required by the cells while waste products are diluted , thus not adversely a ﬀ ecting cell growth ( Figure 4 ) . These optimal culture conditions provided by the G - Rex result in improved cell viability and increased ﬁnal cell numbers without increasing the number of cell doublings , and decreasing the feeding frequency and the number of manipulations required [ 32 ] . For example , for the expansion of EBV - CTLs using the G - Rex we co - culture 1 × 10 6 PBMCs per cm 2 using a G - Rex10 ( surface area of 10 cm 2 —total Stem Cells International 5 O 2 O 2 CO 2 CO 2 T cells G - Rex 10 Gas exchange from the base of the G - Rex 1 m L / c m 2 4 m L / c m 2 24 well plate Gas exchange from the surface of the culture ( a ) G - Rex10 G - Rex100 G - Rex1000 ( b ) Figure 4 : G - Rex culture device . ( a ) shows the limited gas exchange that occurs in conventional cultureware , which limits the volume of media and consequently the available nutrients . In contrast the G - Rex provides gas exchange from the base of the ﬂask which allows cells to be cultured with a superior ratio of media per surface area . ( b ) shows the G - Rex10 with a surface area of 10 cm 2 and a volume capacity of 40mLs , the G - Rex100 with a surface area of 100 cm 2 and a volume capacity of 500 mLs , and the G - Rex1000 with a surface area of 1000 cm 2 and a volume capacity of 5000 mLs . of 1 × 10 7 PBMCs ) with gamma - irradiated ( 40 Gy ) EBV - LCLs at a 40 : 1 ratio in a ﬁnal volume of 40 mL of CTL medium . On days 9 – 12 the second stimulation is performed by removing 20 mL of media ( aspirated from the top ) and adding 20 mLs of fresh CTL medium containing irradiated EBV - LCLs , resuspended at a cell density appropriate to stimulate T cells at a ratio 4 : 1 . Four days after the second stimulation 50 U / mL of IL - 2 is added directly to the culture . Once the cells have expanded to a density of > 5 × 10 6 per cm 2 the cells are transferred to a G - Rex100 ( surface area 100 cm 2 ) and stimulated with irradiated EBV - LCL ( 4 : 1 ) in a ﬁnal volume of 500 mLs of media . These culture conditions have allowed us to decrease the frequency of culture manipulation while increasing the cell output ( 3 – 20 - fold ) and shortening the time of culture [ 32 ] ( Figure 5 ) . We demonstrated that this novel culture system supports the expansion of almost any type of suspension cell , is GMP - compliant , and reduces the number of technician interventions approximately 4 - fold [ 32 ] . This manufacture optimization has been validated , trans - ferred to our GMP facility in 2009 and is now used for all of our CTL production processes . Since that time we have allowed other centers , including the NCI , to cross - reference our IND to enable the use of this cell culture technology in other GMP facilities both within the US and beyond , and this platform is currently used for production of numerous cellular products including activated T cells , antigen - speciﬁc CTLs , NK cells , regulatory T cells , and feeder cells including EBV - LCLs and aK562 [ 32 ] . Importantly , cell culture in the G - Rex can also be linearly scaled which allows an easy transition of protocols from small to large scale . We recently demonstrated this using the new G - Rex600 and G - Rex1000 ( surface area of 600 and 1000 cm 2 , resp . ) , which can generate up to 6 × 10 9 – 1 × 10 10 cells , respectively , in a single device . 6 Stem Cells International 8 × 10 7 to 10 × 10 7 EBV - CTLs Day 10 Day 14 Day 17 Day 24 Day 31 Day 38 Day 45 1 × 10 7 PBMCs 1 × 10 7 PBMCs 1 . 1 × 10 7 EBV - CTLs ( 0 . 9 × 10 7 to 1 . 2 × 10 7 ) 2 . 5 × 10 7 EBV - CTLs 7 . 4 × 10 7 EBV - CTLs 2 . 4 × 10 8 EBV - CTLs 6 × 10 8 EBV - CTLs 4 . 2 × 10 7 EBV - CTLs ( 2 . 4 × 10 7 to 4 . 2 × 10 7 ) 1 . 6 × 10 9 to 2 × 10 9 EBV - CTLs IL - 2 ( 50 μ / mL ) 1 . 5 × 10 9 EBV - CTLs 20mL media change Day 0 24 well plate Expansion of antigen speciﬁc CTLs in 24 well plates Vs G - Rex Time of culture C e ll n u m b e r G - Rex plates , ﬂasks ( a ) ( b ) Multiwell G - Rex10 Figure 5 : Optimization of antigen - speciﬁc CTL manufacture decreases the number of interventions while increasing the cell output .

Third - Party CTLs These manufacturing improvements have allowed us to consider the use of virus - speciﬁc CTLs in the 3rd - party setting and recently we have developed a cell bank to facilitate this endeavor . Administration of this “o ﬀ - the - shelf” product raises two potential concerns : ( i ) the risk of inducing GvHD by administering a partially HLA - mismatched CTL product and ( ii ) limited in vivo persistence , due to recipient alloreactivity directed against nonshared HLA antigens . Nevertheless a number of small studies have demonstrated the feasibility of this approach in the patients with EBV lymphoma arising after HSCT or solid organ transplant . Haque and colleagues used 3rd - party EBV - speciﬁc CTLs to treat PTLD after solid organ transplant or SCT and showed an encouraging response rate of 64 % and 52 % at 5 weeks and 6 months , respectively [ 33 ] . In this study the CTLs were selected by low - resolution typing and screened for high - level killing of donor EBV - LCLs and low - level killing of patient PHA blasts . The level of HLA matching ranged from 2 / 6 to 5 / 6 antigens , and there was a statistically signiﬁcant trend towards a better outcome with closer matching at 6 months . Importantly , no patient developed GVHD after CTL administration . In another report two cord recipients with EBV lymphoma received closely matched EBV - speciﬁc T cells resulting in complete resolution of their lesions [ 34 ] . Currently we are evaluating the safety and potency of using “o ﬀ - the - shelf” trivirus CTL for the treatment of CMV , adenovirus , or EBV infections in patients after HSCT with active infection and that do not respond to conventional therapy . Preliminary results in > 35 recipients , most of whom had received alternative donor transplants , are encouraging , with minimal toxicity and > 80 % achieving complete or partial responses . If this trend continues , we will generate a larger CTL bank to cover as many racial groups as possible and progress to a phase II clinical trial where we can ask more speciﬁc questions regarding the persistence and function of the CTL in vivo . Such a study is dependent on the ability to produce large numbers of CTLs that maintain their speciﬁcity and functional activity and are not “exhausted” by excessive in vitro passaging , and this has become possible only recently with the advent of optimized culture protocols in the G - Rex cultureware that e ﬀ ectively supports CTL expansion . Stem Cells International 7 9 . Future Prospects Manufacture optimization arises from constant and critical reﬂection on the di ﬀ erent processes involved in the gener - ation of a cellular product . The G - Rex culture device is just one example of manufacture optimization taking place at the CAGT . We have also recently simpliﬁed the process of virus - speciﬁc CTL generation by replacing viral vectors and live virus ( previously used as antigen sources ) with clinical grade plasmids and overlapping peptide libraries [ 35 ] . We have also discovered that certain combinations of enhancing and stimulatory cytokines support the e ﬃ cient activation and expansion of both virus - and tumor - reactive CTLs , leading to the new GMP - compliant protocols that enable the rapid generation of high - quality cellular products . Although the manufacture optimization is a research phase that requires time , money , and e ﬀ ort , this is an investment and a pre - requisite for the manufacturing success of a cell product . Ultimately , the ﬁnal “value” of a cell product depends on the in vivo therapeutic e ﬃ cacy ; however , it is the manufacture process that either facilitates or restrains the evolution of such products from the boutique to the mainstream .

Ex vivo expanded erythroblasts ( EBs ) may serve as advanced transfusion products provided that lodgment occurs in the macrophage - niche of the marrow permitting maturation . EBs expanded from adult and cord blood expressed the receptors ( CXCR4 , VLA - 4 , and P - selectin ligand 1 ) necessary for interaction with macrophages . However , 4 - days following transfusion to intact NOD / SCID / IL2R γ null mice , CD235a pos EBs were observed inside CD235a neg splenic cells suggesting that they underwent phagocytosis . When splenectomized and intact NOD / SCID / IL2R γ null mice were transfused using retrovirally labeled human EBs , human cells were visualized by bioluminescence imaging only in splenectomized animals . Four days after injection , human CD235a pos cells were detected in marrow and liver of splenectomized mice but only in spleen of controls . Human CD235a pos erythrocytes in blood remained low in all cases . These studies establish splenectomized NOD / SCID / IL2R γ null mice as a suitable model for tracking and quantiﬁcation of human EBs in vivo . 1 . Introduction Culture conditions capable of generating ex vivo human erythroblasts ( EBs ) in numbers su ﬃ cient for transfusion have been established by several investigators ( reviewed in [ 1 ] ) increasing the likelihood that these cells could serve as alternative transfusion products [ 2 ] . The preclinical evaluation of these products includes testing the in vivo potency of ex vivo generated cells in animal models [ 3 ] . The development of animal models to assess the potency of human EBs generated ex vivo requires a better understanding of the interactions between human EBs and the murine microenvironment and identiﬁcation of animal manipula - tions which may favor lodgment of these cells in the marrow . In vivo , EBs mature in specialized areas of the mar - row in close proximity to macrophages which favors both hemoglobinization , by facilitating iron uptake , and enu - cleation [ 4 , 5 ] . Following enucleation , reticulocytes lose their association with the macrophage and egress into the blood stream . EBs interact with the macrophages through the surface adhesion receptors CXCR4 ( CD184 ) , P - selectin ligand1 ( PSGL1 , CD162 ) , and VLA - 4 ( CD49d , α 4 integrin ) which recognize CXCL12 ( also known as SDF1 ) , P - selectin and VCAM1 , respectively , on the surface of the macrophage [ 4 ] . Under steady - state conditions , few EBs egress from the marrow and these are usually cleared by macrophages in the spleen [ 6 ] . Smears of cultured human EBs often contain macrophages surrounded by clusters of EBs indicating that cultured EBs are capable of interacting with human macrophages derived from blood . However , the adhesion receptor proﬁle of ex vivo generated EBs and the e ﬃ ciency 2 Stem Cells International of the interaction of these cells with murine macrophages are presently unknown . Neildez - Nguyen et al . have reported that human carbox - yﬂuorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester - ( CFSE - ) labeled EBs expanded ex vivo from CD34 pos cells isolated from cord blood di ﬀ erentiate into red blood cells when trans - fused to NOD / SCID mice [ 7 ] . The transfusion protocol included coadministration of exogenous human erythropoi - etin ( EPO ) and intraperitoneal administration of packed human red cells to block the reticuloendothelial system ( leading to transient functional splenectomy ) . Initially , human CFSE pos cells were detected in bone marrow , liver , spleen and lung of the transfused animals and , beginning at day 4 , also in peripheral blood . However , these exper - iments have been viewed with skepticism because human CD34 pos cells engrafted in immunodeﬁcient mice typically generate robust levels of lymphoid and myeloid cells but barely detectable numbers of erythroid cells [ 8 ] . These data have been interpreted as evidence that the murine microenvironment is not permissive for maturation of EBs . Although the molecular structures of human and murine EPO are very similar , it has been suggested that murine EPO may fail to support optimal maturation of human EBs because it does not induce dimerization after binding to the human receptor [ 9 ] . This hypothesis was indirectly supported by Nicolini et al who reported that treatment with human EPO after transplantation greatly increases the generation of human erythroid cells when human CD34 pos cells are injected into immunodeﬁcient mice [ 10 ] . However , the relative contribution of administration of human EPO and packed human red cells to the success of the animal model for human transfusion developed by Neildez - Nguyen et al . [ 7 ] has not been clariﬁed as yet . The aim of our study was to test whether ex vivo generated EBs express the adhesion receptor proﬁle necessary to complete their maturation in vivo and whether inhibition of the interaction between ex vivo generated EBs and splenic macrophages will permit establishment of an in vivo model for functional evaluation of ex vivo expanded human EBs . 2 . Materials and Methods 2 . 1 . Human Subjects . Low volume cord blood units ( CB ) were obtained from the New York Blood Center ( New York , NY , USA ) . Peripheral blood ( PB ) was collected from normal adult donors at the transfusion center of “La Sapienza” University ( Rome , Italy ) . Both specimens were collected according to guidelines established by institutional ethical committees and provided as deidentiﬁed samples . 2 . 2 . Mice . 12 - week - old female NOD / SCID / IL2R γ null mice were purchased from Jackson laboratory and housed in the animal facility of Memorial Sloan - Kettering Cancer Center . All murine studies were performed according to institutional animal care and use committee approved protocols . 2 . 3 . Cell Preparation . Mononuclear cells ( MNCs ) from CB and AB were obtained by centrifugation over Ficoll - Hypaque ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotec , Uppsala , Sweden ) . CD34 pos cells from CB were separated using the Human Cord Blood CD34 Selection Kit ( STEMCELL Technologies Inc , Vancouver , BC , Canada ) , as described by the manufacturer . 2 . 4 . Expansion of Human Erythroblasts . CD34 pos cells and MNC ( 5 × 10 4 and 10 6 cells / mL , resp . ) were cultured under human erythroid massive ampliﬁcation ( HEMA ) conditions in a proliferative phase stimulated with stem cell factor ( SCF , 10 ng / mL , R & D System , Minneapolis , MN , USA ) , erythropoietin ( EPO , 5 U / mL , Epogen , Amgen , Thousand Oaks , CA , USA ) and interleukin 3 ( IL - 3 , 1 ng / mL , Biosource , San Jose , CA , USA ) , dexamethasone and estradiol ( both at 10 − 6 M , Sigma , St . Louis , MO , USA ) up to 10 days and subsequently in a di ﬀ erentiative phase stimulated with EPO ( 5 U / mL ) , insulin ( 10 ng / mL , Calbiochem , La Jolla , CA , USA ) , and FeSO 4 ( 10 − 6 M , Sigma ) up to 4 days , as previously described [ 11 , 12 ] . 2 . 5 . Colony Forming Assay . The colony forming ability of sorted cells was evaluated in standard semisolid methylcel - lulose cultures ( 40 % , Fluka Biochemika ) stimulated with SCF ( 10 ng / mL ) , IL - 3 ( 10 ng / mL ) , granulocyte - macrophage colony - stimulating factor ( GM - CSF , 10 ng / mL ) , granulocyte colony - stimulating factor ( G - CSF , 100 ng / mL ) and EPO ( 5 U / mL ) . The cultures were incubated at 37 ◦ C in a fully humidiﬁed 5 % pCO 2 atmosphere and scored after 2 days for colony forming unit erythroid ( CFU - E ) and after 8 days for burst forming unit erythroid ( BFU - E ) and colony forming unit granulocyte - macrophages ( CFU - GM ) colonies . 2 . 6 . Cell Viability and Phenotypic Analysis . Cell numbers and viability were assessed by microscopic evaluation after trypan blue ( Boston Bioproducts , Ashland , MA , USA ) staining . Erythroid cells were identiﬁed using standard morphological criteria by visual examination of cytocentrifuged cell prepa - rations ( Cytospin 3 , Shandon , Astmoor , England ) stained with May - Gr¨unwald - Giemsa ( Fisher Scientiﬁc , Pittsburg , PA , USA ) using the Axioscope light microscope equipped with a Coolsnap video camera ( Zeiss , Oberkochen , Ger - many ) . For ﬂow cytometric analyses , cells were suspended in Ca 2 + / Mg 2 + - free phosphate - bu ﬀ ered saline , supplemented with 1 % BSA , stained with either phycoerythrin - ( PE - ) conjugated CD36 ( antithrombospondin receptor ) [ 13 ] , - CD184 ( CXCR4 ) , - CD162 ( PSLG1 ) , - CD49d ( VLA - 4 ) , or allophycocyanin - ( APC - ) conjugated CD235a ( anti - glyco - phorin A ) , pan hematopoietic human - ( FITC - ) conjugated CD45 or appropriate isotype controls ( all from Becton Dickinson Biosciences , Franklin Lakes , NJ , USA ) . For GFP determinations , autoﬂuorescence of untreated cells was analysed as negative control . Fluorescence was analyzed with the FACS Canto ( Becton Dickinson Biosciences ) equipped with three air - cooled and solid - state lasers ( 488 nm , 633 nm and 407 nm ) . Dead cells were excluded by propidium iodide ( PI , 5 μ g / mL , Sigma ) staining . 2 . 7 . Fluorescence Labelling of Human EBs . CFSE Labeling . EBs obtained at day 11 of HEMA cultures were stained with Stem Cells International 3 CFSE ( 10 μ M , Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) as described [ 14 ] and cultured for 24 additional hrs under HEMA conditions . Retrovirally mediated labeling . CB CD34 pos cells were cultured for 3 days in X - VIVO 10 media ( Lonza Walk - ersville , Walkersville , MD , USA ) containing thrombopoietin ( TPO , 100 ng / mL ) , SCF ( 100 ng / mL ) , Flt3 Ligand ( Flt3L , 100 ng / mL ) , IL - 3 ( 20 ng / mL ) , and the PG - 13 retroviral producer supernatant [ 15 , 16 ] which contains the membrane anchored form of the Gaussia luciferase enzyme ( extGLuc ) [ 16 ] was added twice 24 hrs apart . The transfected CD34 pos cells were then cultured under HEMA conditions for 6 additional days . An aliquot of nontransduced CD34 pos cells from the same isolation was cultured in parallel under HEMA condition as control . 2 . 8 . Transfusion Protocol . Two protocols were investi - gated . In the ﬁrst experiment ( See Supplementary Fig - ure 1 in Supplementary Material available online at doi : 10 . 4061 / 2011 / 673752 ) , 2 NOD / SCID / IL2R γ null mice were injected via the tail vein with 25 × 10 6 CFSE - labeled EBs . Twenty - four hrs prior to injection , mice were bled ( 500 μ L ) to increase endogenous EPO levels . In the second experiment ( Supplementalry Figure 2 ) , intact and splenec - tomized NOD / SCID / IL2R γ null mice ( 4 mice per group ) were used . NOD / SCID / IL2R γ null mice were anaesthetized with isoﬂurane ( Baxter , Deerﬁeld , USA ) and splenectomized after double ligation of the splenic artery and vein [ 17 ] . The muscle , peritoneum , and skin were closed in sepa - rate layers using sterile 5 – 0 absorbable suture . Intact and splenectomised mice were transfused via the tail vein with 25 × 10 6 retrovirally labeled EBs together with human EPO ( 20 U / mouse ) . Twenty four hours earlier , mice had been bled ( 500 μ L ) . In both experiments , mice receiving culture media only served as negative controls and all the mice were sacriﬁced 4 - 5 days following transfusion for further analyses . 2 . 9 . Immunocytochemistry . Smears of single cell suspensions from femur , spleen , and liver and cultured EBs prepared by cytocentrifugation ( Shandon , Astmoor , England ) were ﬁxed with paraformaldehyde ( 3 . 7 % , Electron Microscopy ScienceHatﬁeld , PA , USA ) for 30 min and rinsed 2 times with double distilled water . Smears were incubated with an antihuman glycophorin A antibody ( CD235a , Abcam , Cambridge , MA , USA ) and the immunoreaction detected with the avidin - biotin immunoperoxidase system ( Vectas - tain Elite ABC Kit ; Vector Laboratories , Burlingame , CA ) on slides counterstained with hematoxylin - eosin , as described by the manufacturer . Aliquots of injected EBs and smears from media - treated mice were used as positive and neg - ative controls , respectively . Histological observations were carried out using a ZEISS AXIOSKOPE light microscope ( Jena , Germany ) equipped with a Coolsnap Videocamera . Enumeration of human CD235a pos cells was performed by two separate investigators in a blinded fashion . 2 . 10 . Bioluminescence Imaging . Bioluminescence was detect - ed using a Xenogen IVIS Imaging System ( Xenogen ) as pre - viously described [ 18 ] . Imaging was performed 24 – 48 hrs following intravenous injection of coelenterazine ( 250 μ g ) ( Nanolight Technology ) via the tail vein . Dorsal and ventral images of the animals were acquired with acquisition times in the range of 1 to 3 min . Field of view of 15 , 20 , or 25 cm with low , medium , or high binning in an open ﬁlter was utilized to maximize signal intensity and sensitivity . We obtained acquisition of image datasets and measurements of signal intensity through region of interest ( ROI ) analysis using Living Image software ( Xenogen ) . Normalized images are displayed on each dataset according to color intensity . 2 . 11 . Statistical Analyses . Results are expressed as mean ( ± SD ) of at least three replicate experiments unless stated otherwise . Statistical analysis was performed by Anova using the computer software Origin 5 . 0 for Windows ( Microcal Software , Inc . , Northampton , MA , USA ) . 3 . Results 3 . 1 . Cord Blood MNC Generate Greater Numbers of Less Mature Erythroid Cells Than Adult Blood MNC under HEMA Conditions . Our group has previously identiﬁed a culture strategy for massive production of EBs ex vivo from both CB and AB MNC deﬁned as human erythroid massive ampliﬁcation ( HEMA ) culture [ 11 ] . Under these culture conditions , in the experiments included in this paper , AB MNC generated EBs with an FI = 15 while the number of EBs generated by CB MNC was 3 - times greater ( FI = 40 Figure 1 ) . By CD36 / CD235a proﬁling , EBs generated under HEMA conditions may be separated into 4 classes of progressively more mature cells represented by CD36 high / CD235a neg ( class I , gate R1 ) and CD36 high CD235a low ( class II , gate R2 ) cells , which contain colony - forming unit - erythroid ( CFU - E ) and pro - EBs , and CD36 high CD235a high ( class III , gate R3 ) and CD36 low CD235a high cells ( class IV , gate R4 ) , which contain basophilic - polychromatic and orthochromatic EBs , respectively ( Supplemental Figure 3 ) . BFU - E - and CFU - GM - derived colonies are not detectable in cells generated in HEMA culture from day 8 on ( data not shown ) . At day 10 of HEMA culture , a signiﬁcant proportion of EBs generated in cultures of AB and CB MNC are represented by immature class I and class II EBs ( 38 and 78 % , resp . ) ( Figure 1 and Table 1 ) . Exposure of Day 10 EBs derived from both AB and CB to EPO alone for 4 days increased the proportion of mature class III and IV EBs up to 52 – 70 % . CB - derived EBs contained a lower fraction of mature cells than AB - derived EBs both in HEMA culture and when cultured with EPO alone ( Figure 1 and Table 1 ) . Macrophage islands surrounded by 6 – 9 EBs were com - monly detected in smears of both AB and CB derived EBs beginning at day 7 and up to day 10 of HEMA culture ( Figure 1 ( c ) ) . The frequency of these islands on the smears was correlated with the frequency of nonerythroid cells which had survived in culture ( data not shown ) . The random nature the macrophages in HEMA culture prevented quantiﬁcation of this phenomenon .

The ability of CB and AB EBs obtained at day 10 to proceed along the maturation pathway after 4 days of culture in the presence of EPO only is also compared ( b ) . The ﬂow cytometric proﬁle used to deﬁne EBs maturation is presented in Supplemental Figure 3 . The ﬂow charts are representative of those obtained in at least three independent experiments with MNC from di ﬀ erent CB or AB donors .

Dynamic Pattern of Adhesion Receptor Proﬁling during the Maturation of AB - and CB - Derived EBs in Culture . The expression patterns of CXCR4 , PSLG1 , and VLA - 4 on EBs obtained from AB and CB at day 10 of HEMA and induced to mature for 4 days in cultures containing EPO alone is presented in Figures 2 , 3 , and Supplemental Figure 4 . Expression of CXCR4 was barely detectable either in AB - or CB - derived EBs at day 10 of culture , irrespective of the stage of maturation ( Figures 2 and 3 ) . Exposure of these cells to EPO alone rapidly ( within 1 day ) activated CXCR4 expression ﬁrst on immature cells ( Class 1 , R1 ) and then by day 4 also on cells expressing a more mature phenotype ( Class 2 for AB EBs and Class 2 + 3 for CB EBs ) . The most mature Class 4 EBs ( both from AB and CB ) never expressed CXCR4 ( Figures 2 and 3 ) . The dynamic pattern of CXCR4 expression is visualized by the direct comparison of CD184 ( CXCR4 ) and CD235a ( glycophorin A ) expression as AB and CB EBs matured in EPO alone culture presented in Supplemental Figure 4 . Although similar patterns of CXCR4 expression were observed in EBs derived from AB and CB , a greater percentage ( 30 – 80 % versus 15 – 40 % ) of CB - derived EBs expressed CXCR4 than AB EBs and the mean ﬂuorescence intensity ( MFI ) was also greater for CB ( range 1000 – 2500 versus 500 – 1000 ) . At day 10 , both AB and CB derived EBs expressed high levels of PSLG1 regardless of their maturation stage ( 80 – 90 % PSLG1 pos cells with MFI in the range of 1000 – 4000 ) ( Figures 2 and 3 ) . The expression of PSLG1 was conserved when EBs were induced to mature with EPO alone for 4 days ( Figures 2 and 3 ) although direct comparison of PSLG1 expression against CD235a indicated an association Stem Cells International 5 010 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 0 20 40 60 80 100 010 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 0 20 40 60 80 100 010 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 0 20 40 60 80 100 010 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 0 20 40 60 80 100 010 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 0 20 40 60 80 100 010 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 0 20 40 60 80 100 010 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 0 20 40 60 80 100 010 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 0 20 40 60 80 100 010 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 0 20 40 60 80 100 010 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 0 20 40 60 80 100 010 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 0 20 40 60 80 100 010 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 0 20 40 60 80 100 010 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 0 20 40 60 80 100 010 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 0 20 40 60 80 100 010 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 020406080100 010 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 0 20 40 60 80 100 010 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 0 20 40 60 80 100 010 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 0204060 80100 010 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 0204060 80100 010 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 0204060 80100 010 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 0 20 40 60 80 100 010 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 0 20 40 60 80 100 010 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 0 20 40 60 80 100 010 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 0 20 40 60 80 100 010 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 0 20 40 60 80 100 010 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 0 20 40 60 80 100 010 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 0 20 40 60 80 100 010 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 020406080100 010 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 020406080100 010 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 0 20 40 60 80 100 010 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 0 20 40 60 80 100 010 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 0 20 40 60 80 100 010 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 0 20 40 60 80 100 010 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 0 20 40 60 80 100 010 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 0 20 40 60 80 100 010 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 0 20 40 60 80 100 100 10 2 10 2 10 3 10 3 10 4 10 4 10 5 10 5 0 0 4 R3 20 . 63 7 . 38 R1 R2 R4 11 . 98 2 . 83 10 2 10 2 10 3 10 3 10 4 10 4 10 5 10 5 0 0 Di 1 R1 R2 R3 R4 1 . 42 55 . 37 18 . 83 5 . 27 R4 Prol10 CD36 C D 235 a CD36 C D 2 35 a CD36 C D 235 a 10 2 10 2 10 3 10 3 10 4 10 4 10 5 10 5 0 0 0 . 79 R1 R2 R3 48 . 34 23 . 17 8 . 46 day Di day PSGL - 1 VLA - 4 CXCR4 PSGL - 1 VLA - 4 CXCR4 PSGL - 1 VLA - 4 CXCR4 R1 R2 R3 R4 R1 R2 R3 R4 R1 R2 R3 R4 ( a ) Adult Blood 1 4 0 . 49 7 . 47 2 . 93 48 . 82 0 . 78 31 . 04 25 . 65 19 . 75 1 . 1 38 . 16 15 . 69 6 . 58 R1 R1 R2 R2 R3 R3 R4 R1 R2 R3 R4 R1 R2 R3 R4 R4 Prol10 CD36 C D 235 a CD36 C D 23 5 a CD36 C D 235 a 10 2 10 2 10 3 10 3 10 4 10 4 10 5 10 5 0 0 R1 R2 R3 R4 10 2 10 2 10 3 10 3 10 4 10 4 10 5 10 5 0 0 R1 R2 R3 R4 10 2 10 2 10 3 10 3 10 4 10 4 10 5 10 5 0 0 Di day Di day 010 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 020406080100 010 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 020406080100 010 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 020406080100 010 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 020406080100 010 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 020406080100 010 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 020406080100 010 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 020406080100 010 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 020406080100 010 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 020406080100 010 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 020406080100 010 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 020406080100 010 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 020406080100 010 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 0 20406080100 010 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 0 20406080100 010 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 0 20406080100 010 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 020406080100 010 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 020406080100 010 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 020406080100 010 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 020406080100 010 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 020406080100 010 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 020406080100 010 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 020406080100 010 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 020406080100 010 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 020406080100 010 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 020406080100 010 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 020406080100 010 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 020406080100 010 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 020406080100 010 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 020406080100 010 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 020406080100 010 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 020406080100 010 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 020406080100 010 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 020406080100 010 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 020406080100 010 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 020406080100 010 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 020406080100 PSGL - 1 VLA - 4 CXCR4 PSGL - 1 VLA - 4 CXCR4 PSGL - 1 VLA - 4 CXCR4 ( b ) Cord Blood Figure 2 : Adhesion receptor proﬁling during in vitro maturation of EBs expanded from AB ( a ) and CB ( b ) . Three color ﬂow cytometry analysis for CD36 and CD235a in combination with either CXCR4 ( CD184 ) , PSGL - 1 ( CD162 ) , or VLA - 4 ( CD49d ) of EBs obtained at day 10 of HEMA culture from AB and CB MNC ( Prol 10 ) and at day 1 ( Di ﬀ Day 1 ) and 4 ( Di ﬀ Day 4 ) of maturation with EPO alone , as indicated . EBs were divided into 4 maturation classes deﬁned by the levels of CD36 and CD235a expression identiﬁed by the gates R1 to R4 and corresponding to Class 1 to 4 ( see Supplemental Figure 3 for further details ) . between reduced expression of this receptor and maturation which was particularly evident in the case of AB - derived EBs ( Supplemental Figure 4 ) . A great percentage ( 60 – 100 % ) of day 10 EBs expressed robust levels of VLA - 4 ( MFI in the range of 1000 – 3000 for AB EBs and 2000 – 6000 for CB EBs ) regardless of their maturation status . The frequency of VLA4 pos EBs remained high when the cells were induced to mature with EPO for 4 days , although in the case of AB EBs the levels of VLA4 expression per cell decreased with time in culture when stimulated with TPO alone ( Figures 2 and 4 ) . The apparently high maturation - independent pattern of VLA4 expression in AB and CB EB was also observed by direct analyses of VLA4 / CD235a expression patterns ( Supplemental Figure 4 ) . 6 Stem Cells International AB AB C X C R 4 V L A - 4 P S L G 1 0 5 10 15 20 25 Prol Di 1 Di 2 Di 3 Di 4 Prol Di 1 Di 2 Di 3 Di 4 0102030405060708090100 Prol Di 1 Di 2 Di 3 Di 4 Prol Di 1 Di 2 Di 3 Di 4 01020 30 405060708090100 Prol Di 1 Di 2 Di 3 Di 4 Prol Di 1 Di 2 Di 3 Di 4 0102030405060708090100 Frequency ( % ) 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Class 1 Class 2 Class 3 Class 4 Class 1 Class 2 Class 3 Class 4 Class 1 Class 2 Class 3 Class 4 Class 1 Class 2 Class 3 Class 4 Prol Di 1 Di 2 Di 3 Di 4 Prol Di 1 Di 2 Di 3 Di 4 Prol Di 1 Di 2 Di 3 Di 4 Prol Di 1 Di 2 Di 3 Di 4 0102030405060708090100 Prol Di 1 Di 2 Di 3 Di 4 010 2030 405060708090100 Prol Di 1 Di 2 Di 3 Di 4 0102030405060708090100 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 CB CB Frequency ( % ) × 10 3 × 10 3 × 10 3 × 10 3 × 10 2 × 10 2 Mean ﬂuorescence intensity Mean ﬂuorescence intensity Figure 3 : Time course of the frequency and MFI of CXCR4 , PSL1 , and VLA4 expression during in vitro maturation of EBs expanded from adult and cord blood , as indicated . Values observed with EBs at di ﬀ erent stages of maturation are color coded : Class 1 ( gate R1 ) : light orange , Class 2 ( gate R2 ) : red , Class 3 ( gate R3 ) : brown , and Class 4 ( gate R4 ) : black ( see also Supplemental Figure 1 ) . The results correspond to the ﬂow charts presented in Figure 2 . In conclusion day 10 EBs express low levels of CXCR4 but robust levels of PSLG1 and VLA4 . Induction of these cells to mature by exposure to EPO alone rapidly activates CXCR4 expression but has modest or no e ﬀ ect on the expression of PSLG1 and VLA4 , with the exception of a reduction in the number of PSLG1 pos class 2 and class 3 EBs observed in culture of AB - derived cells . 3 . 3 . Cell Fate of Ex Vivo Expanded CB EBs in NOD / SCID / IL2R γ null Mice . The greater levels of adhesion receptor expression of CB EBs suggested that these cells might be more able than AB EBs to establish the cellular interactions necessary for maturation in vivo and therefore more suitable for use in animal models to analyze cell fate following transfusion . We chose the NOD / SCID / IL2R γ null mouse as the animal model for these experiments because it has been shown to readily support engraftment of human CD34 pos hematopoietic stem cells and represents a superior , long - lived model suitable for studies employing xenotransplanta - tion strategies [ 20 , 21 ] . In preliminary experiments , the fate of murine RFP - labeled EBs derived from liver and transfused into syngeneic thalassemic mice was determined . Murine RFP - labeled EBs ( 30 – 150 × 10 6 ) transfused in unbled thalassemic mice generated undetectable or barely detectable levels of red cells . By contrast , when mice were bled 150 to 600 μ L 24 hrs before transfusion , the same numbers of murine RFP - labeled EBs generated as many as 5 × 10 9 - 5 × 10 10 red cells ( A . R . Migliaccio and P . Frenette , unpublished observations ) . These results indicate that bleeding facilitates in vivo maturation of transfused murine EBs , probably by increasing endoge - nous EPO levels . On the basis of these data we decided to bleed animals 24 hr prior to transfusion with human EBs . In the initial three experiments , CFSE - labeled EBs derived from CD34 pos CB cells after 11 days in HEMA culture were transfused via the tail vein ( 25 × 10 6 EBs per mouse ) into NOD / SCID / IL2R γ null mice that were bled ( 500 μ L ) the day before ( Supplemental Figure 3 ) .

At day 4 , FACS analyses revealed the presence of 0 . 99 – 1 . 18 % and 2 . 57 – 5 . 29 % of CD235a pos cells ( both CFSE pos and CFSE neg ) in bone marrow and spleen , respectively , of the transfused mice ( Figure 4 ( a ) and Table 2 ) . The presence of CFSE neg CD235a pos cells indicated that some of the human EBs had undergone proliferation in vivo during the 4 days after transfusion . Assuming that the total number of cells in bone marrow and spleen of a mouse is 300 × 10 6 cells and ∼ 10 8 cells , respectively [ 19 ] , it is calculated that the bone marrow and spleen of the transfused animals contained 8 Stem Cells International 2 r e t r o v i r a l l a b e l i n g + 7 d a y s H E M A e x p a n s i o n 9 d a y s H E M A c u l t u r e 5 × 10 4 C D 34 + c e ll s 5 × 10 6 C D 34 + c e ll s CD34 pos isolation Day 9 Day 0 80 % E v e n t s eGFP CD36 C D 235 a 0 50 100 150 200 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 0 0 10 2 10 2 10 3 10 3 10 4 10 4 10 5 10 5 0 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 010 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 d a y s Figure 5 : Ex vivo expanded extGLuc + EBs express high level of eGFP by FACS analyses . Maturation proﬁle and transfection e ﬃ ciency of nontransfected ( as control , top panels ) and transfected ( bottom panels ) EBs at day 9 of HEMA culture identiﬁed on the basis of CD36 / CD235a and eGFP expression ( on the left ) and on the basis of morphology ( May - Grunwald staining , on the right ) , magniﬁcation 40x . The transfected EBs express great levels of eGFP . The transfection did not alter the morphology of the cells but slightly reduced the expression of the CD235a probably due to interference with the GFP signal . At day 9 , in transfected and control cultures the fold increase was 48 - fold and 325 - fold , respectively , and the viability was 98 % in both cases . ∼ 3 . 5 × 10 6 ( 1 . 7 % of 3 × 10 8 cells ) and 7 × 10 6 ( 6 . 8 % of 10 8 cells ) human EBs , respectively ( Table 2 ) . Therefore , the majority of human EBs lodged in the spleen . Immunocyto - chemical analyses for the expression of the human erythroid CD235a marker conﬁrmed the presence of numerous ( 18 % of the total cell population ) human CD235a pos cells in the spleen of the transfused animals ( Figure 4 ( b ) ) . However , the CD235a pos cells were trapped inside larger CD235a neg cells , probably macrophages of murine origin . By day 18 , very few ( 0 . 01 – 0 . 06 % ) human CD235a pos cells were detectable in the blood . By day 21 , human CD45 pos cells were undetectable in marrow , spleen , and liver of the transfused NOD / SCID / IL2R γ null mice , conﬁrming the colony forming data , which indicated that CB EBs expanded for 10 days under HEMA conditions no longer contain hematopoietic progenitor cells . These results suggest that human EBs lodged preferentially in the spleen where they were engulfed and probably destroyed by macrophages . To determine if splenectomy would facilitate lodgment in the marrow , the fate of ex vivo expanded EBs trans - fused to splenectomized and intact NOD / SCID / IL2R γ null mice was compared . Cell biodistribution was analyzed by retroviral - mediated labeling with the external Gaussia luciferase genes ( extGLuc ) , using bioluminescence imaging , and e green ﬂuorescent protein ( eGFP ) was used for ﬂow cytometry determinations of CD34 pos CB cells which were then expanded under HEMA conditions ( see [ 16 ] and Supplemental Figure 2 ) . The extGLuc enzyme is a newly engineered Gaussia luciferase which contains the CD8 trans - membrane domain at its carboxy terminus . The presence of this domain allows membrane anchoring and cell surface retention of extGLuc , signiﬁcantly enhancing the biolumi - nescent signal [ 16 ] . The expansion potential of retrovirally transduced and control CD34 pos CB cells is compared in Figure 5 . By day 9 , 5 × 10 4 unmanipulated CD34 pos CB cells generated 16 × 10 6 EBs ( FI = 325 - fold ) while 5 × 10 6 CD34 pos CB cells which had been cultured for 3 days under conditions permissive for retroviral transduction ( see Supplemental Figure 2 ) generated 240 × 10 6 EBs ( FI = 48 ) , the great majority of which ( 80 % ) expressed robust levels of eGFP ( MFI > 5 × 10 4 ) . The di ﬀ erence in FI between HEMA culture of unmanipulated and retrovirally transduced CD34 pos CB cells was not associated with changes in death rates , as evaluated by propidium iodide staining ( data not shown ) and may be related to the likelihood of underestimations of the low number of cells ( 5 × 10 4 ) used to initiate the cultures of un - manipulated cells . By FACS analysis , the majority of CD36 pos EBs derived from retrovirally transduced CD34 pos CB cells did not express CD235a . However , by morphological analysis the maturation stage of these cells was comparable to that of EBs derived from un - manipulated CB cells ( Figure 5 ) . Stem Cells International 9 We believe that lower expression of CD235a by the retro - virally transduced EBs was a consequence of interference between the ﬂuorescence signal of this antibody and that of eGFP . Aliquots ( 25 × 10 6 ) of retrovirally transduced EBs were injected via the tail vein together with 20 U of human EPO in splenectomized and control NOD / SCID / IL2R γ null mice which had been bled ( 500 μ L ) the day before . Bioluminescent imaging was performed 24 and 48 hrs after transfusion . Twenty - four hrs after transfusion , the extGLuc biolumines - cent signal was virtually undetectable , other than at the site of injection in intact mice ( Figure 6 ) . In contrast , signiﬁcant levels of extGLuc signal were observed in legs and skull of splenectomized mice , an indication that human EBs may have homed to the BM . In these mice , signiﬁcant levels of bioluminescent signal were also detected in the abdomen ( Figure 6 ) . These data demonstrate that in the absence of the spleen CB EBs lodge in marrow and liver . Four days after transfusion , mice were sacriﬁced and the presence of human CD235a pos cells in bone marrow and liver of the transfused NOD / SCID / IL2R γ null mice was analyzed by FACS . In the case of intact mice , great numbers ( ∼ 15 % of the total cell population ) of human CD235a pos cells were detected in spleen while human CD235 pos cells in marrow and liver were barely detectable . By contrast , in splenec - tomized animals , great numbers of human CD235a pos cells were detectable in bone marrow ( 25 % ) and liver ( 7 % ) ( Figure 7 ) . Interestingly these cells did not express CD36 , an indication that they had matured in vivo . However , red cells in the blood remained low both in intact and splenectomized mice ( data not shown ) . These results indicate that the removal of the spleen favors homing of human EBs to the bone marrow of NOD / SCID / IL2R γ null mice . 4 . Discussion An important issue for the quality and safety of cellular products lies in the development of a surrogate assay for a cell product that is as close as possible to the ﬁnal product intended for therapeutic use . Short of a phase I clinical study , the optimal evaluation of human cell products is represented by preclinical studies performed in immuno - deﬁcient mouse models . In our experience , such an approach can not only help validation studies and the establishment of a potency assay , but also help guide the development of the production process itself by deﬁning optimal cell puriﬁcation procedures , culture conditions , and scale - up systems . This study focused on establishing a xenogeneic model to test EBs expanded ex vivo under HEMA conditions as potential transfusion products . The availability of such a model may advance other areas of research by providing a single method to compare the functional status of EBs derived from primary hematopoietic stem / progenitor cells with those derived from other stem cells sources such as human embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells . This study demonstrates that the maturation of ex vivo generated CB - and AB - derived EBs is associated with a dynamic pattern of adhesion receptor expression . At day 10 – 11 of HEMA culture , the majority of immature AB - and CB - derived EBs expressed low levels of CXCR4 and high levels of both VLA - 4 and P - selectin ligand 1 ( Figures 2 and 3 ) . Once induced to mature by exposure to EPO alone , these EBs rapidly ( within 24 hrs ) activated expression of CXCR4 while retaining expression of VLA - 4 and down - modulating expression of PSGL - 1 . By day 4 of maturation culture , the majority of EBs had progressed to the mature CD235a high CD36 high phenotype ( Figure 1 and Table 1 ) and had reduced expression of all the adhesion receptors . Minor ontogenetic di ﬀ erences where observed since CB EBs expressed greater levels of CXCR4 , PSGL - 1 , and VLA4 and activated CXCR4 expression upon EPO exposure more readily than AB EBs . While the adhesion receptor pattern expressed by human erythroblasts maturing in vivo is not known , these data are available in mice . Immature murine EBs obtained from both fetal liver and adult bone marrow express robust levels of CXCR4 , PSGL - 1 and α 4 integrins . These cells lose PSGL - 1 expression and retain CXCR4 and VLA - 4 expression with maturation [ 22 , 23 ] . These high levels of CXCR4 represent the major di ﬀ erence between the pattern of adhesion receptors expressed by murine cells and those expressed by ex vivo expanded human EBs . The low levels of CXCR4 expression in human EBs generated in HEMA and the fact that these cells rapidly , within 24 hrs , acquire CXCR4 expression upon exposure to EPO alone are consistent with reports that CXCR4 expression is suppressed by dexamethasone [ 24 ] , one of the components of HEMA culture [ 11 ] . On the other hand , the low levels of CXCR4 expression observed when human EBs mature ( Class 4 ) is expected since these cells are supposed to downregulate expression of CXCR4 , the major receptor involved in cell retention in the marrow [ 25 ] , as part of the process which allows them to egress from the marrow [ 6 ] . A separate set of experiments evaluated the fate of CFSE - or retrovirally - labeled CB - derived human EBs when transfused in NOD / SCID / IL2R γ null mice . Bleeding and / or infusing the animals with human EPO to increase EPO levels greatly increased the detection of human EBs in the animals . By day 4 after transfusion , 1 . 5 – 5 % of the cells in BM and spleen , respectively , of the animals were positive for human CD235 pos by ﬂow cytometry ( Figure 4 ( a ) ) . However , by immunohistochemistry , high numbers ( 18 % ) of cells positive for human CD235a by immunohistochemistry were detectable in the spleen ( Figure 4 ( b ) ) . The human CD235a pos cells , however , appeared trapped inside larger CD235a cells suggesting that they had probably undergone phagocytosis by murine macrophages . These results indicated that pref - erential splenic lodgment and clearance of human EBs may represent a barrier to the use of mouse models for functional evaluation of human transfusion products . CXCR4 plays a major role in cell lodgment and retention in bone marrow [ 25 ] but is dispensable for cell homing in spleen [ 17 , 19 ] . We hypothesized that failure of human CB EBs to lodge in bone marrow may be determined by unbalanced expression of CXCR4 with respect to the expression of other adhesion receptors , such as PSGL1 , VLA - 4 , and CD36 ( CD36 speciﬁcally guide cell interaction with the endothelial system [ 26 ] ) .

Bioluminescent imaging of nonsplenectomized ( left panels ) and splenectomized ( right panels ) mice 24 hrs after injection with extGLuc + EBs , as indicated . Dorsal and ventral imaging is presented in the top and bottom panels , respectively . In intact mice , the bioluminescent signal was virtually undetectable other than at the site of injection ( the tail ) . In the splenectomized mice , signiﬁcant signal levels were observed in limbs ( lower extremity ) , skull ( indicating marrow localization ) , and abdomen ( indicating liver localization because the spleen had been removed ) . Arrows indicate the positive signal . Data are representative of those observed with 4 mice per experimental point . the spleen , by reducing cell interactions mediated by these receptors , may favor lodgment in the marrow of EBs expressing low levels of CXCR4 . This hypothesis was tested by comparing lodgment of human EBs in the bone marrow of intact and splenectomized NOD / SCID / IL2R γ null mice . Bioimaging , followed by ﬂow cytometry analyses , indicated that in the absence of the spleen retrovirally - labeled human EBs lodge in greater numbers in the marrow of the transfused animals ( Figure 6 ) . These results indicate that removal of the spleen greatly improves the survival of human EBs in mice . However , although signs of in vivo maturation were detected ( detection in the marrow of cells positive for human CD235a but negative for CD36 ) , the numbers of human erythrocyte detected in the blood of the transfused animals remained low . Since CXCR4 expression was likely upregulation when human EBs were transfused in vivo ( the cells were no longer exposed to DXM but exposed to human EPO ) , it is possible that , in addition to splenectomy , lodgment of human EBs in the marrow of the transfused animals may be improved by experimental approaches designed to increase CXCR4 expression , such as short pretransfusion exposure to EPO in vitro ( Figures 2 and 3 ) . Since cycling cells are known to have inferior homing [ 27 , 28 ] , in addition to increasing CXCR4 expression , these pretreatments may also improve homing by reducing the number of proliferating EBs . Indirect proof that CXCR4 over - expression may facilitate homing of human EBs in the marrow was recently obtained . Although treatments with many chromatin modifying agents decreases CXCR4 expression [ 29 ] the HDAC inhibitor valproic acid ( VPA ) is well known for its ability to upregulate CXCR4 expression while downmodulating expression of α - integrins and other adhesion receptors in several cell types [ 30 , 31 ] . Recently Chaurasia et al . [ 32 ] have demonstrated that ex vivo expanded EBs obtained from VPA - treated CB CD34 pos cells colonize , in addition to the spleen , the bone marrow when transfused into NOD / SCID and NOD / SCID / IL2R γ null mice which had been functionally splenectomized by blocking the reticuloendothelium system with intraperitoneal injection Stem Cells International 11 10 2 10 2 10 3 10 3 10 4 10 4 10 1 10 1 10 0 10 0 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 1 10 0 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 1 10 0 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 1 10 0 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 1 10 0 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 1 10 0 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 1 10 0 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 1 10 0 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 1 10 0 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 1 10 0 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 1 10 0 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 1 10 0 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 1 10 0 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 1 10 0 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 1 10 0 CD235a C D 36 Bone marrow Spleen Liver T r a n s f u s e d m i c e C o n t r o l S p l e n e c t o m i z e d N o n s p l e n e c t o m i z e d N .

Flow cytometry analysis of bone marrow ( left panels ) , spleen ( middle panels ) and liver ( right panels ) from splenectomized ( top panels ) , non splenectomized ( middle panels ) , and nontransfused controls ( bottom panels ) of representative mice are shown . The small numbers indicate the frequency of the cells detected within the respective quadrant . Values within circles correspond to the percentage of human cells calculated by subtracting the frequency detected in the negative controls in the corresponding bottom panels . The red circles indicate the frequency of human cells . Of note , the majority of the human CD235a positive cells were negative for CD36 , an indication that the human EBs had matured in vivo . Similar results were obtained by analyzing the cells for eGFP expression . Data are representative of those obtained with 3 mice per experimental point . of human type O + red cells , as ﬁrst reported by Neildez - Nguyen et al . [ 7 ] . However , since Chaurasia et al . [ 32 ] did not measure the levels of adhesion receptors expressed by VPA - treated EBs , it is not possible to assess the relative contribution of functional splenectomy and / or upregulation of CXCR4 ( and / or down regulation of VLA - 4 and PSGL - 1 expression ) to the improved lodgment of these cells in the marrow . Further studies are necessary to clarify this issue in order to establish the optimal pre - treatment ( splenec - tomy versus functional reticulo - endotheium blockade ) of the mouse model for functional evaluation of transfusion products generated by di ﬀ erent stem cell sources . A major di ﬀ erence between this study and the report by Chaurasia et al . [ 32 ] is represented by the levels of human erythrocytes detected in the blood of the transfused animals . In our study , human erythrocytes were barely detectable in the blood at any time point after transfusion while in the study of Chaurasia et al . discrete numbers of mature erythrocytes were detectable in the circulation starting from day 7 after transfusion ( 15 % in NOD / SCID mice and 30 % in the improved NOD / SCID / IL2R γ null model ) . However , progenitor cells were no longer detectable among the human EBs expanded under HEMA conditions in this study ( CD45 pos cells were undetected in the transfused mice ) 12 Stem Cells International while representing a signiﬁcant proportion ( 7 % ) of the VPA - treated cells transfused by Chaurasia et al . [ 32 ] . It is therefore possible that in this case release of human erythrocytes in the blood was favored by the presence of human macrophages generated by human hematopoietic progenitors in the animal model . Another possibility , however , is that in our experiments , the erythrocytes released in the blood were cleared by the immune system . Immunological responses have represented a barrier to the development of mouse models for functional assessment of human red cell products [ 33 ] . These barriers include cell - mediated and humoral immune responses triggered by antigens speciﬁcally expressed on red cells . Since some of the epitopes present on red cell antigens are expressed also by proteins on the membrane of bacteria presents in gut ﬂora [ 34 ] , red blood cells may trigger immune reactions leading to red cell lyses even in the absence of any prior sensitization . NOD / SCID , and the improved NOD / SCID / IL2R γ null mice , lack cell mediated and immunoglobulin - mediated humoral responses ( these mice do not have B cells ) . In addition , a great proportion of the immune - response against red blood cell antigens are often initiated in the spleen [ 35 ] which was transiently inactivated in [ 7 , 32 ] and permanently removed in our study . The complement system plays a signiﬁcant role in the humoral mediated red cell clearance in vivo . Since NOD / SCID / IL2R γ null mice lack C5 [ 21 ] , they have reduced activation levels of the alternative complement pathway . However , these mice express C3 [ 21 ] and may activate the classical complement pathway responsible for lysis of the human CD55 and CD59 deﬁcient red cells observed in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria ( PNH ) [ 36 ] , preventing the use of NOD / SCID / IL2R γ null mice for development of animal models for PNH studies . Human CB EBs expanded ex vivo under HEMA conditions express CD55 ( 53 – 87 % positive EBs , MFI = 110 – 330 ) and CD49 ( 54 – 70 % , MFI = 1 , 900 – 2500 ) . However , the expression of these antigens greatly decreased when the cells were induced to mature with EPO for 5 days ex vivo ( CD55 : 17 – 27 % EBs , MFI = 30 – 32 ; CD59 : 28 – 56 % , MFI = 20 – 76 , data from 2 separate cultures ) ( A . R . Migliaccio and C . Whitsett , unpub - lished data ) . It is therefore possible that ex vivo expanded human EBs also lost CD55 / CD59 expression during their maturation in the marrow of NOD / SCID / IL2R γ null mice making their progeny susceptible to C3 - mediated lysis . Since C3 deﬁcient mice have been recently developed [ 37 ] , we predict that C3 - deﬁcient NOD / SCID / IL2R γ null mice will represent a better read - out animal model for the presence of human erythrocytes in the blood . In conclusion , we describe data indicating that splenec - tomized NOD / SCID / IL2R γ null mice represent a surrogate in vivo model to assess the potency of transfusion products generated ex vivo from di ﬀ erent stem cell sources .

The supply of transfusable red blood cells ( RBCs ) is not su ﬃ cient in many countries . If transfusable RBCs could be produced abundantly from certain resources , it would be very useful . Our group has developed a method to produce enucleated RBCs e ﬃ ciently from hematopoietic stem / progenitor cells present in umbilical cord blood . More recently , it was reported that enucleated RBCs could be abundantly produced from human embryonic stem ( ES ) cells . The common obstacle for application of these methods is that they require very high cost to produce su ﬃ cient number of RBCs that are applicable in the clinic . If erythroid cell lines ( immortalized cell lines ) able to produce transfusable RBCs ex vivo were established , they would be valuable resources . Our group developed a robust method to obtain immortalized erythroid cell lines able to produce mature RBCs . To the best of our knowledge , this was the ﬁrst paper to show the feasibility of establishing immortalized erythroid progenitor cell lines able to produce enucleated RBCs ex vivo . This result strongly suggests that immortalized human erythroid progenitor cell lines able to produce mature RBCs ex vivo can also be established . 1 . Introduction Transfusion therapies involving RBCs , platelets , and neu - trophils depend on the donation of these cells from healthy volunteers . However , unpredictable adverse results can ensue from transfusion therapies because of the donation of cells from a very large number of anonymous volunteers . For example , transfusion of blood products that include hazardous viruses or prions is di ﬃ cult to prevent completely , because , occasionally , tests to detect them yield pseudo - negative results . There is little doubt that RBCs , platelets , and neutrophils produced ex vivo would be candidate materials to replace cells donated from such a large group of anonymous individuals . The development of technologies such as PCR and gene knockout that enable the manipulation of an organism’s genetic material contributed tremendously to progress in the life sciences in the ﬁnal decades of the last century . This century looks to continue this progress through the development of further new technologies relating to cell manipulation . 2 . Discovery of Plasticity in Terminally Differentiated Cells It was believed for a long time that epigenetic modiﬁcations in di ﬀ erentiated somatic cells were irreversible . This meant that terminally di ﬀ erentiated cells could never return to being immature cells . However , in 1962 , it was reported that the nuclei of somatic cells of an amphibian ( frog ) were reprogrammed following transfer into enucleated unfertil - ized eggs [ 1 ] . Following transfer of a somatic cell nucleus , the egg could undergo cell division and di ﬀ erentiate to produce an adult frog . This result clearly indicated that epigenetic modiﬁcations in terminally di ﬀ erentiated somatic cells were reversible . Dr . John Gurdon , who performed this groundbreaking study , received the Albert Lasker Basic Medical Research Award in 2009 . Initially , many biologists believed that this reversibility of epigenetic modiﬁcations in terminally di ﬀ erentiated cells was restricted to amphibian somatic cells and did not occur in mammalian somatic cells . However , in 1997 , a nuclear transfer experiment in sheep in which somatic nuclei were 2 Stem Cells International transferred into unfertilized eggs showed that epigenetic modiﬁcations in terminally di ﬀ erentiated mammalian somatic cells were also reversible [ 2 ] . This experiment famously resulted in the birth of the ﬁrst live cloned sheep , named “Dolly” . 3 . Immortalization of ES Cells The methodology for isolating and culturing mouse ES cells was ﬁrst developed in 1981 [ 3 ] and has aided research in a wide range of biological studies . Dr . Martin Evans , who developed the technology for establishing mouse ES cell lines , was awarded a Nobel Prize in 2007 together with Dr . Mario Capecchi and Dr . Oliver Smithies , who developed homologous recombination technology in mouse ES cells . As a result of these technical advances , functional analysis of genes has progressed considerably using mice with gene knockouts or other genetic modiﬁcations . It is well known that mouse cells can be immortalized simply by continuous in vitro culture , for example , using the so - called “3T3 protocol” . One widely exploited example of an immortalized cell line is NIH3T3 , which continues to be used in a wide range of experiments . In contrast , it is not possible to immortalize human somatic cells in a similar manner and this di ﬃ culty gave rise to the widespread assumption that it would not be possible to establish human ES cell lines . However , in 1998 , 17 years after the ﬁrst establishment of mouse ES cell lines , it was reported that human ES cell lines could also be produced by continuous in vitro culture [ 4 ] . 4 . Therapeutic Cloning The ability to reprogram mammalian somatic cells by nuclear transfer and to establish human ES cell lines stim - ulated medical scientists to investigate the creation of ES cell lines using nuclear transfer as a potential means of achieving “therapeutic cloning” . If this technology could be established as a viable therapy , then patients who would beneﬁt from somatic cell transplantation could be treated with nuclear - transferred ES cells produced using their own somatic cells , which would avoid the possibility of transplant rejection as the cells possess the same major histocompatibility ( MHC ) antigens as host tissue . Although an earlier report of successful therapeutic cloning by a group in Korea proved false , it was recently reported that primate ES cell lines have been established by nuclear transfer technology [ 5 ] . Since unfertilized primate eggs are much more fragile than those of rodents , it may still take some time to establish the technology for use in human therapeutic cloning . However , the prospect of using such therapy no longer seems to be so distant . 5 . A Search for Alternative Technologies to Therapeutic Cloning An important limitation to the use of therapeutic cloning is that it requires unfertilized eggs . Human eggs are very di ﬃ cult to obtain , and , moreover , their use for this purpose also raises serious ethical issues . For these reasons , a search has been initiated for alternative methodologies that avoid nuclear transfer . One approach has been to search for factors in unfertilized eggs that may be required for the repro - gramming of transferred somatic nuclei . Another avenue of research has been to elucidate which genes speciﬁcally function in ES cells , since these genes may maintain the undi ﬀ erentiated state of ES cells , and thus might be able to induce reprogramming of nuclei in terminally di ﬀ erentiated somatic cells . The research group led by Dr . Shinya Yamanaka reported the ﬁrst success in the latter approach . They were able to induce di ﬀ erentiated mouse somatic cells to become pluripotent stem cells by the application of four deﬁned factors [ 6 ] . The enforced expression of the transcription factors Oct3 / 4 , Sox2 , Klf4 , and c - Myc in terminally di ﬀ er - entiated somatic cells induced cellular reprogramming and changed the cells into ES - like pluripotent stem cells . These reprogrammed cells were named “induced pluripotent stem ( iPS ) cells” . Subsequently , in the year after establishment of human iPS cell lines was ﬁrst reported , several other groups also succeeded with this methodology [ 7 – 10 ] . Dr . Shinya Yamanaka , who developed the method , was given the Albert Lasker Basic Medical Research Award in 2009 together with Dr . John Gurdon . The mechanisms underlying the reprogramming of terminally di ﬀ erentiated somatic cells following the enforced expression of the four factors remain to be elucidated . It is now known that expression of these factors after exogenous introduction is completely suppressed in established iPS cells . Thus , the factors seem to be required only for the repro - gramming process but not for maintenance of pluripotency . Regardless of the mechanisms involved , this discovery clearly indicated that terminally di ﬀ erentiated somatic cells could be reprogrammed without nuclear transfer into unfertilized eggs and opened a new dawn for therapeutic cloning [ 11 – 13 ] . 6 . ExVivo RBC Production from Hematopoietic Stem / Progenitor Cells The rapid progress relating to cell manipulation technology described above prompted many scientists in various ﬁelds to consider cell therapy using the cells produced and / or manipulated ex vivo . The scientists in the ﬁeld of hematology are naturally aiming to produce the terminally di ﬀ erentiated blood cells able to use in the clinic . RBC transfusion was the ﬁrst transplantation procedure to be established and is now routine and indispensable for many clinical purposes . However , in many countries , the supply of transfusable materials is not always su ﬃ cient . In Japan , for example , the supply of RBCs with an AB / RhD ( − ) phenotype is always lacking , because individuals with this RBC phenotype are rare . This problem of inequalities in the supply and demand for RBCs has stimulated interest in the development of ex vivo procedures for the generation of functional RBCs from hematopoietic stem cells or progenitor cells . The hematopoietic stem cells that are present in bone marrow and umbilical cord blood are promising materials Stem Cells International 3 for ex vivo production of RBCs . In particular , umbilical cord blood cells are readily available , as they are usually discarded . Provided the mother of a neonate consents to use of the umbilical cord , this material can provide a useful resource without any further complicating critical or ethical concerns . Neildez - Nguyen et al . reported that human erythroid cells ( nucleated cells ) produced on a large scale ex vivo could di ﬀ erentiate in vivo into enucleated RBCs [ 14 ] . They developed a culture protocol to expand CD34 + erythroid progenitor cells based on a 3 - step expansion of cells by sequential supply of speciﬁc combinations of cytokines to the culture medium [ 14 ] . This study demonstrated that ery - throid progenitor cells produced ex vivo from hematopoietic stem and / or progenitor cells could have a clinical application as an alternative method for transfusing terminally di ﬀ er - entiated RBCs . Later , the same group described an ex vivo methodology for producing fully mature human RBCs from hematopoietic stem / progenitor cells [ 15 ] . The enucleated RBCs produced by this approach are potentially even more valuable , as they should be functional immediately after transfusion without requiring time for enucleation as is necessary with the erythroid cells . 7 . Enucleation of Erythroid Progenitor Cells The mechanism of erythroblast enucleation , a critical step in RBC production , has not yet been fully elucidated [ 16 , 17 ] . The role of the interaction of erythroblasts with other cells , such as macrophages , is a controversial topic in this process [ 18 – 22 ] . Macrophages in retinoblastoma gene - ( Rb - ) deﬁcient embryos are unable to physically interact with erythroblasts , and RBC production is impaired in these embryos [ 21 ] . In addition , in vitro production of enucleated RBCs from immature hematopoietic progenitor cells proceeds e ﬃ ciently in the presence [ 15 ] but not in the absence [ 14 ] of feeder cells . However , enucleation can apparently be initiated ex vivo in erythroblasts that have been induced to di ﬀ erentiate in vivo to a developmental stage that is competent for nuclear self - extrusion [ 22 , 23 ] . Consistent with these ﬁndings , our group discovered a method to produce enucleated RBCs e ﬃ ciently ex vivo without use of feeder cells [ 24 ] . Our system for expanding erythroid progenitor cells and inducing e ﬃ cient enucleation of those progenitor cells is shown in Figure 1 . The method we developed included VEGF and IGF - II in the culture medium [ 24 ] . These two factors have been reported to promote the survival , proliferation , and / or di ﬀ erentiation of hematopoietic progenitors [ 25 – 27 ] . Con - sistent with these ﬁndings , these factors promoted the expan - sion of erythroid progenitors [ 24 ] . However , a much more important feature of our culture system is that it allowed erythroid cells to di ﬀ erentiate to a developmental stage competent for nuclear self - extrusion [ 24 ] . It has generally been thought that e ﬃ cient enucleation of erythroblasts is largely dependent on signals mediated by cells in their local environment [ 18 – 21 ] . However , the data we reported demonstrate that the interaction of erythroblasts with other cells is not necessary for e ﬃ cient erythroblast enucleation Hematopoietic stem / progenitor cells Passage I ( 6days ) : SCF , EPO , IL - 3 , VEGF and IGF - II Passage II ( 4days ) : SCF and EPO Passage III ( 6days ) : SCF and EPO Passage IV ( 4days ) : MAP and mifepristone Enucleated red blood cells Figure 1 : Culture protocol for the e ﬃ cient production of enu - cleated red blood cells without feeder cells from hematopoietic stem / progenitor cells . Passage I ∼ III are the steps to expand ery - throid progenitor cells . Passage IV is the step to induce enucleation of progenitor cells . SCF , stem cell factor ; EPO , erythropoietin ; IL - 3 , interleukin - 3 . VEGF , vascular endothelial growth factor ; IGF - II , insulin - like growth factor - II ; MAP , mixture of D - mannitol , adenine , and disodium hydrogen phosphate dodecahydrate . [ 24 ] . Signals mediated by humoral factors appear to be su ﬃ cient for the e ﬃ cient autonomous completion of ery - throblast enucleation . In addition , since culture without the use of feeder cells is technically easier and less expensive , the method we developed has the potential to be a cost - e ﬀ ective means of producing transfusable RBCs on a large scale from immature hematopoietic stem / progenitor cells . 8 . RBC Production from ES / iPS Cells ES / iPS cells possess the potential to produce various di ﬀ er - entiated cells able to function in vivo , and thus represent another promising resource for RBC production ex vivo . Furthermore , since ES / iPS cell lines are immortalized , they can be used repeatedly and have potential to produce abun - dant di ﬀ erentiated cells in the quantities required for clinical use . However , it will be important to carry out routing screening of the ES / iPS cell lines for de novo chromosomal aberrations and / or genetic mutations that may arise during culture , before these long - term cell cultures are applied in the clinic . Unsurprisingly , there is now a widespread and enthusiastic debate on standardization of the characteristics of ES / iPS cells for regenerative medicine protocols that exploit these cell lines . In our opinion , since chromosomal aberrations and genetic mutations are inevitable in long - term cell cultures , only ES / iPS cell lines that have been cultured for a limited period , for example , less than 30 passages , should be selected for clinical use . Hematopoietic cells , including those in the erythroid lineage , have been generated from mouse ES cells [ 28 – 31 ] , nonhuman primate ES cells [ 32 – 34 ] , and human ES cells [ 35 – 41 ] . Our group has also established a long term in vitro method for culturing hematopoietic cells derived from ES cells of the nonhuman primate , the cynomolgus monkey [ 27 ] . Recently , abundant productions of mature RBCs from human ES cells [ 42 ] and human iPS cells [ 43 ] were also reported . 4 Stem Cells International 9 . Establishment of Immortalized Erythroid Progenitor Cell Lines Able to Produce Enucleated RBCs As described above , we can now produce mature RBCs by in vitro culture of ES / iPS cells or the hematopoietic stem / progenitor cells present in umbilical cord blood . In practice , however , the e ﬃ ciency of RBC generation varies with the quality of the ES / iPS cell line , or the umbilical cord blood sample . Since ES / iPS cell lines can be utilized repeatedly , derivation of RBCs from ES / iPS cells appears to be more practical . However , even with optimal experimental procedures and the most appropriate ES / iPS cell line the generation of abundant RBCs directly from ES / iPS cells is a costly and time - consuming process . If immortalized human erythroid progenitor cell lines can be established that have e ﬃ cient production of mature RBCs , they would provide a much more useful resource than ES / iPS cell lines . Several mouse and human erythroid cell lines have been established . However , to the best of our knowledge , there is no cell line that can e ﬃ ciently di ﬀ erentiate into enucleated RBCs . It is generally di ﬃ cult to establish hematopoietic cell lines from adult hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells , as both are sensitive to DNA damage and are unable to maintain the lengths of telomere repeats on serial passage [ 43 ] . In contrast , ES cells are relatively resistant to DNA damage and maintain telomere lengths on serial passage [ 44 ] . Therefore , these characteristics of ES / iPS cells may be advantageous for the establishment of cell lines , since di ﬀ erentiated cells derived from ES / iPS cells may retain them . In fact , an erythroid cell line has been established from in vitro - di ﬀ erentiated GATA - 1 - deﬁcient mouse ES cells [ 45 ] . Recently , we developed a robust method to obtain di ﬀ er - entiated cell lines following the induction of hematopoietic di ﬀ erentiation of mouse ES cells ( Figure 2 ) and established ﬁve independent hematopoietic cell lines using this method [ 46 ] . Three of these lines exhibited characteristics of ery - throid cells , and they were designated m ouse E S cell - d erived e rythroid p rogenitor ( MEDEP ) cell lines . Although their precise characteristics varied , each of the MEDEP lines could di ﬀ erentiate in vitro into more mature erythroid cells , including enucleated RBCs . Following transplantation into mice su ﬀ ering from acute anemia , MEDEP cells proliferated transiently and subsequently di ﬀ erentiated into functional RBCs . Treated mice showed a signiﬁcant amelioration of acute anemia . In addition , MEDEP cells did not form tumors following transplantation into mice . This paper was the ﬁrst to demonstrate the feasibility of establishing immortalized erythroid cell lines able to produce mature RBCs . After the work above , we have continuously cultured the established MEDEP cell lines so as to observe whether the characteristics of them were stable . After long - term cultures for more than one and a half year , all MEDEP cell lines maintained the characteristics able to di ﬀ erentiate into mature erythroid cells producing hemoglobin abundantly ( Figure 3 ) . Of note , the characteristics of one of the MEDEP cell lines , MEDEP - BRC5 , have changed to that able to produce enucleated RBCs very e ﬃ ciently ; that is , more Embryonic stem cells Phase I : Feeder cells ( OP9 ) , VEGF and IGF - II culture for 4days Phase II : Feeder cells ( OP9 ) , SCF , EPO , IL - 3 and dexamethasone culture for approximately 2months Phase III : SCF , EPO , IL - 3 and dexamethasone culture in the absence of feeder cells Phase IV : Essential factor ( s ) alone culture for maintenance Figure 2 : Culture protocol to establish erythroid progenitor cell lines from embryonic stem cells . In most cases , the cells failed to proliferate within two months of the initial induction of di ﬀ erentia - tion from ES cells . Induced cells that could proliferate continuously for approximately two months ( 60 days ) were subsequently cultured in the absence of OP9 cells and in the presence of hematopoietic humoral factors . Cells that could proliferate in the absence of OP9 cells were cultured further . Approximately four months after the initial induction of di ﬀ erentiation of the cells , we evaluated the factors that were essential for the proliferation of each cell line .

Scale bars indicate 20 μ m . than 50 % of the cells were the enucleated RBCs following the induction of di ﬀ erentiation into mature erythroid cells ( Figure 4 ) . This result demonstrates that the interaction of erythroid progenitor cells with other cells is not necessary for e ﬃ cient enucleation . At present , the mechanism underlying the establishment of di ﬀ erentiated cell lines from ES cells has not been elu - cidated . Nevertheless , the data we reported clearly indicate that useful erythroid cell lines can be reproducibly obtained from mouse ES cells . Given that di ﬀ erentiation strategies developed for mouse ES cells often di ﬀ er from those applied to human ES cells [ 47 ] , the method we developed [ 46 ] may not be directly applicable to human ES cells and will require some modiﬁcation . 10 . iPS Cells as a Source for Establishing Immortalized Erythroid Progenitor Cell Lines To establish the MEDEP cell lines , we screened eight types of mouse ES cell line and succeeded in establishing MEDEP cell lines from three of these [ 46 ] . By extrapolation from this result , it may be that many more human ES cell lines than currently available worldwide will be necessary to establish usable erythroid cell lines . In this context , the establishment of human iPS cell lines [ 7 – 10 ] should help to solve the problem of a potential shortfall , since human iPS cells have very similar characteristics as human ES cells . 6 Stem Cells International Therefore , we attempted to establish human iPS cell lines and were able to establish a number of human iPS cell lines using ﬁbroblast - like cells derived from neonatal tissues [ 48 ] . Fortunately , we were able to induce abundant numbers of hematopoietic cells from some of these iPS cell lines and also to establish immortalized hematopoietic cell lines from the induced hematopoietic cells ( unpublished results ) . Currently , we are investigating the characteristics of these immortalized hematopoietic cell lines . Some seem to be erythroid cell lines . 11 . Clinical Application of Erythroid Progenitor Cell Lines We reported that MEDEP cells did not exhibit tumorigenic - ity in vivo [ 46 ] . Nevertheless , the tumorigenic potential of any human erythroid cell line will need to be thoroughly analyzed prior to clinical use [ 49 , 50 ] . In addition , it may be advisable to engineer these cells in such a way that they are eliminated if a malignant phenotype arises for any reason [ 51 ] . Alternatively , the use of terminally di ﬀ erentiated cells that no longer have the capability of proliferating should allow clinical applications of ES / iPS cell derivatives without the associated risk of tumorigenicity . Thus , for example , RBCs lack nuclei following terminal di ﬀ erentiation and are highly unlikely to exhibit tumorigenicity in vivo . As such , even if the original ES / iPS cells and / or their derivatives possessed abnormal karyotypes and / or genetic mutations , they might , nonetheless , be useful for clinical applications , provided that they can produce enucleated RBCs . Indeed , the MEDEP lines included many cells possessing abnormal karyotypes ; however , the vast majority of the cells in each cell line , nevertheless , di ﬀ erentiated into mature erythroid cells and transplantation of these cells signiﬁcantly ameliorated anemia [ 46 ] . As described in this paper , various methods have been developed that enable the ex vivo production of enucleated RBCs from human hematopoietic stem / progenitor cells [ 14 , 15 , 24 ] and ES / iPS cells [ 42 , 43 ] . Therefore , once appropriate erythroid progenitor cell lines have been established , it should be possible to apply these methods for producing enucleated RBCs ex vivo . Since RBCs are much smaller than normal nucleated cells , RBCs produced ex vivo could be selected by size prior to use in the clinic so as to exclude nucleated cells , for example , by ﬁltration . In addition , X - ray irradiation might be useful for eradicating any contaminat - ing nucleated cells without a ﬀ ecting the RBCs . Another potential obstacle to the clinical use of ES / iPS cell derivatives is that of immunogenicity [ 52 , 53 ] . Trans - planted MEDEP cells could not ameliorate acute anemia in mouse strains other than those from which each indi - vidual cell line was derived or in immunodeﬁcient mice [ 46 ] , suggesting immunological rejection in heterologous strains . Hence , the clinical application of erythroid cell lines will require use of many cell lines that express di ﬀ erent major histocompatibility ( MHC ) antigens . However , ex vivo - generated RBCs need to be compatible with ABO and RhD antigens alone . Furthermore , the establishment of an immortalized human erythroid cell line lacking the genes to produce A , B , and RhD antigens would be a very useful resource for clinical application , since such a cell line would produce O / RhD ( − ) RBCs , which would , in theory , be transfusable into all individuals . 12 . Conclusions It is now highly likely that immortalized human erythroid progenitor cell lines able to produce enucleated RBCs can be established in the near future . We believe that the transfusion of RBCs produced ex vivo from such cell lines will become a standard procedure in the clinic . References [ 1 ] J . B .
