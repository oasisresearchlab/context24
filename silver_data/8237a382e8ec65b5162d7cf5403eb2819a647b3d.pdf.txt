Here we show , using fluorescence anisotropy assays , that the carboxy - terminal WA domain of WASP binds to a single actin monomer with a K d of 0 . 6 m M in an equilibrium with rapid exchange rates . Both WH - 2 and CA sequences con - tribute to actin binding . A favourable D H of – 10 kcal mol – 1 drives binding . The WA domain binds to the Arp2 / 3 complex with a K d of 0 . 9 m M ; both the C and A sequences contribute to binding to the Arp2 / 3 complex . Wiskott – Aldrich - syndrome mutations in the WA domain that alter nucleation by the Arp2 / 3 complex over a tenfold range without affecting affinity for actin or the Arp2 / 3 complex indicate that there may be an activation step in the nucleation pathway . Actin filaments stimulate nucleation by producing a fivefold increase in the affinity of WASP - WA for the Arp2 / 3 complex . T he Arp2 / 3 complex 1 initiates actin - filament assembly in motile cells by nucleating filaments that grow in the barbed direction as branches from existing filaments 2 , 3 . The Arp2 / 3 complex is concentrated at the leading edge of motile cells 4 – 6 and is localized to filament branches 7 . The complex is intrinsically inactive in nucle - ation and branching , and therefore requires activation 8 . The first activator to be identified was ActA 9 , a surface protein of the bacteri - um Listeria monocytogenes that is necessary and sufficient for actin - based motility of the bacterium in the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells . The first recognized eukaryotic activator of the Arp2 / 3 complex was the C terminus ( WA domain ) of WASP / Scar family of proteins , which consists of a WH - 2 motif ( W ) that binds to actin monomers and an acidic tail ( A ) that binds to the Arp2 / 3 complex 10 – 14 . A cofil - in - homology motif has been postulated between the WH - 2 and A sequences , but the structure of these residues bound to the GTPase - binding domain ( GBD ) of WASP 15 is different to the corresponding sequence in ADF / cofilins 16 , 17 , so we refer to it as the connecting sequence , C . Actin filaments enhance WA - mediated activation of nucleation by the Arp2 / 3 complex 8 , 11 . Together , WASP / Scar WA and actin filaments can stimulate every Arp2 / 3 complex in an assay to create a new actin filament , largely as branches 3 . WASP is the product of the gene that is mutated in human patients with Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome , a disease that causes vari - able defects in blood clotting and immune defences as a result of deficiencies of the actin cytoskeleton of white blood cells and platelets 18 . Cells in other tissues express proteins related to WASP called N - WASP and Scar isoforms 1 – 3 . All have C - terminal WA sequences that activate the Arp2 / 3 complex 11 , 12 , 14 , but each WASP / Scar protein differs in the regulatory domains present in the amino - terminal 85 % of these molecules . WASP and N - WASP each have an EVH1 domain that binds to proline - rich sequences 19 , 20 , and a GBD that binds either to the Rho - family GTPase Cdc42 ( ref . 21 ) or to the C region of the WA domain 15 . Interaction of the GBD with the C region auto - inhibits the ability of WA to activate the Arp2 / 3 com - plex 22 . Cdc42 and polyphosphoinositides relieve this auto - inhibition , although the literature is quite divergent on the mechanism 12 , 22 – 24 . Here we characterize interactions of WASP - WA and Scar - WA with actin monomers and the Arp2 / 3 complex to learn how WA activates actin nucleation by the Arp2 / 3 complex and how muta - tions in WA cause disease in Wiskott – Aldrich - syndrome patients . We show that efficient actin nucleation requires both recruitment of an actin monomer to the Arp2 / 3 complex and a subsequent acti - vation step . We also show that the first two steps in this pathway , binding of WA to an actin monomer and to the Arp2 / 3 complex , are both rapidly reversible equilibria with submicromolar affinities , with binding to actin favoured over binding to the Arp2 / 3 complex . Actin filaments seem to stimulate nucleation by enhancing binding of WA to the Arp2 / 3 complex . Results Characterization of rhodamine – WASP - WA . We used fluorescence anisotropy assays to measure binding of WASP - WA labelled with tetramethylrhodamine - 5 ¢ - maleimide to actin and the Arp2 / 3 com - plex . We used similar assays to study interactions of profilin 25 and actophorin 26 , 27 with actin monomers and filaments . The N - termi - nal border of the WA domain is not rigorously defined , so we eval - uated four WASP - WA constructs of different lengths ( Fig . 1a ) . WASP - WA does not contain cysteine , so we added a cysteine residue to the N terminus of each construct . Fluorescence anisotropy of rhodamine – WASP - WA varied between constructs and preparations from 0 . 08 – 0 . 10 , as expected for peptides of rela - tive molecular mass ( M r ) 8 , 600 – 10 , 600 . Binding of WASP - WA to actin . Titration of the four rho - damine – WASP - WA constructs with muscle Mg - ATP – actin monomers in polymerization buffer yielded binding isotherms ( Fig . 2a ) with K d values of 0 . 05 – 0 . 35 m M ( Table 1 ) . Sedimentation - equilibrium ultracentrifugation of 9 m M WASP - 429 - WA ( Fig . 1a ) with 20 m M actin and 40 m M latrunculin B in KMEI buffer ( 10 mM imidazole pH 7 . 0 , 50 mM KCl , 1 mM EGTA and 1 mM MgCl 2 ) gave an M r of 51 , 000 ( 51K ) for the rhodamine ( measured at 550 nm ) , which corresponds to the M r of a 1 : 1 complex of WA with an actin monomer . The affinity of rhodamine – WASP - 406 - WA for Mg - ADP – actin ( K d 1 . 2 m M ) was threefold lower than for Mg - ATP – actin . Fluorescence anisotropy of rhodamine – WASP - 406 - WA was the same with or without 5 m M polymerized actin ( Fig . 2d ) , confirming that it does not bind to actin filaments 8 , 10 . Competition between unlabelled WASP - 429 - WA and each labelled WASP - WA construct for binding to actin ( Fig . 2b ) yielded a K d of 0 . 6 m M for unlabelled WASP - 429 - WA ( Table 1 ) , the same as © 2000 Macmillan Magazines Ltd articles NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOL 3 JANUARY 2001 http : / / cellbio . nature . com 77 that measured in assays of pointed - end polymerization under these conditions 8 . Thus , rhodamine labelling increased the affinity of WASP - WA for actin , and competition of unlabelled constructs with rhodamine – WASP - 429 - WA yielded reliable measurements of affinity . Human profilin - I and thymosin - b 4 competed with rho - damine – WASP - 429 - WA for binding to actin monomers , indicating that their actin - binding sites may overlap . Their measured affinities for actin ( K d 0 . 17 m M for profilin and 0 . 8 m M for thymosin ) are consistent with data obtained by other methods 25 . Latrunculin B did not affect binding of WASP - WA to actin in polymerization buffer , and 12 m M latrunculin B completely inhibited polymeriza - tion of 4 m M 5 % pyrenyl - actin . Human Scar1 - WA competed with rhodamine – WASP - WA for binding to actin monomers with a K d of 0 . 1 m M . As the yields of recombinant Scar1 - WA were higher than those of any WASP - WA construct , we used Scar1 - WA in kinetic and thermodynamic exper - iments . The time course of displacement of rhodamine – WASP - WA from actin by Scar1 - WA followed a single exponential with a value of 3 s – 1 ( Fig . 2c ) . Using this rate constant and the K d value , the cal - culated association rate constant for binding of rhodamine – WASP - WA to actin is 43 m M – 1 s – 1 . Three different methods indicated that neither WASP - WA nor Scar1 - WA has a compact structure . Circular - dichroism spectra had minima at 200 nm . Deconvolution of these spectra by four meth - ods indicated small fractions of secondary structure : WASP - WA ( 1 – 9 % a - helix , 4 – 13 % b - sheet , 65 – 75 % turn and unordered ) ; Scar1 - WA ( 8 – 11 % a - helix , 7 – 17 % b - sheet , 65 – 85 % turn and unordered ) . Sedimentation - velocity ultracentrifugation of Scar1 - WA in KMEI gave a sedimentation coefficient of 1 . 0 S , a diffusion coefficient of 10 . 2 m m 2 s – 1 and a frictional ratio of 1 . 3 , which is indicative of an asymmetric particle . Titration of Scar1 - WA with urea gave a linear twofold increase of intrinsic tryptophan fluores - cence rather than a sharp transition , which is typically observed when compact proteins with buried tryptophan residues unfold . Titration calorimetry provided an independent method to assess the stoichiometry and affinity of Scar - WA binding to actin monomers and a direct test of whether binding involves immobi - lization of the conformationally flexible WA domain . Titration of actin with Scar1 - WA in polymerization buffer with excess latrun - culin B to prevent polymerization ( Fig . 2g , h ) yielded an equilibri - um constant ( K d 0 . 2 m M ) that was similar to the spectroscopic measurements , a stoichiometry of 1 : 1 and D H of – 10 . 1 kcal mol – 1 ( see Supplementary Information ) . None of this actin pelleted in the ultracentrifuge , confirming that latrunculin B prevented polymer - ization throughout the long titration in polymerization buffer . In low - salt buffer , binding of Scar1 - WA to actin was tenfold weaker , but D H was similar ( – 9 kcal mol – 1 ) . The temperature dependence of D H in low - salt buffer ( Fig . 2i ) gave a heat - capacity change of – 315 cal mol - 1 K – 1 . See Discussion for an explanation of how these thermodynamic parameters show that the conformation of WA is restricted when it binds to actin . Mapping of the interaction between WASP - WA and actin . Peptides ( Fig . 1a ) corresponding to the W and CA regions , but not C or A , of WASP competed weakly with rhodamine – WASP - 429 - WA for bind - ing to monomeric actin ( Table 1 ) . Thus , WASP - WA has at least two independent , low - affinity sites that bind to actin . Actin binding was further characterized by inducing the following point mutations in WA : Q443R , N445K and K446T in a QLNK motif that is conserved among WASP / Scar proteins and WIP / verprolin 28 ; and K476E , R477K and D485N , three missense mutations that occur in patients with Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome 29 – 31 .

All three WAS mutant proteins had the same affinity for actin as wild - type WASP - WA . Comparison of the affinities of these mutant constructs with their abilities to stimulate actin nucleation revealed the existence of an activation step subsequent to binding ( see Discussion ) . Binding of WASP - WA to the Arp2 / 3 complex . The fluorescence anisotropy of rhodamine – WASP - 429 - WA bound to the Arp2 / 3 complex ( 0 . 18 ) was lower than for saturating actin ( 0 . 23 , Fig . 2a , d ) even though the Arp2 / 3 complex is five times larger . Rhodamine may be less immobilized when bound to the Arp2 / 3 complex than to actin .

In competition with rhodamine – WASP - 429 - WA , the K d of unlabelled WASP - 429 - WA for the Arp2 / 3 complex was 0 . 9 m M ( Fig . 2e ) . Thus , as for actin binding , rhodamine increased the affinity of the WA domain for the Arp2 / 3 complex , but compe - tition assays yielded reliable measurements of affinity . The affinity of rhodamine – WASP - 429 - WA for the Arp2 / 3 com - plex was 5 – 6 - fold higher in the presence of 5 m M polymerized actin ( Fig . 2d ) . Addition of latrunculin B - bound actin monomers to rho - damine – WASP - 406 - WA saturated with the Arp2 / 3 complex result - ed in a saturable increase in anisotropy , indicating that WASP - WA can bind to actin and the Arp2 / 3 complex simultaneously . Neither actophorin nor profilin competed with rhodamine – WASP - 429 - WA for binding to the Arp2 / 3 complex . Human Scar1 - WA competed with rhodamine – WASP - WA for binding to the Arp2 / 3 complex with a K d of 0 . 5 m M . Displacement with unlabelled Scar1 - WA ( Fig . 2f ) gave a rate constant of 0 . 2 s – 1 for dissociation of rhodamine – WASP - 429 - WA from the Arp2 / 3 complex and a calculated association rate constant of 0 . 8 m M – 1 s – 1 . Mapping of the interaction between WASP - WA and the Arp2 / 3 complex . Peptides A and CA competed weakly with rhodamine – WASP - 429 - WA for binding to the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Table 1 ) , whereas peptides W and C did not . Although we detected no interaction of C peptide with the Arp2 / 3 complex , CA bound to the Arp2 / 3 complex with fivefold greater affinity than did A . Neither the point mutations in the QLNK motif nor the WAS mutations affected the affinity of WASP - WA for the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Table 1 ) , but mutation of tryptophan 500 to serine eliminated detectable binding to the Arp2 / 3 complex . This tryptophan residue is conserved in all WASP / Scar - family proteins as well as in fungal myosin - Is . Actin - filament nucleation . We used actin - filament nucleation to assess the ability of WASP - WA constructs to activate the Arp2 / 3 complex 8 . The rate of polymerization at every time point in the assay is directly proportional to the concentration of filament ends 11 , 32 . At 10 nM , Arp2 / 3 - complex nucleation is proportional to the concentration of activated Arp2 / 3 complex , which continues to generate new filaments until actin monomers are depleted 8 . Under these conditions the activity of WASP - WA constructs can be meas - ured by comparing the concentrations of WASP - WA constructs required to activate nucleation by the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Fig . 3a , b ) . Unlabelled WASP - 429 - WA at 0 . 45 m M activated polymerization half - maximally . Rhodamine labelling of WA - domain constructs caused a roughly threefold reduction in their ability to activate the Arp2 / 3 complex . None of the W , C or A peptides , either separately or together , had any effect on nucleation . The activity of CA was 200 - fold weaker than that of WA , indicating that stronger actin binding by WH2 may enhance nucleation by CA . None of the three mutations in the QLNK motif of WH2 affect - ed the ability of WASP - WA to stimulate actin nucleation by the Arp2 / 3 complex , in spite of the fact that these constructs vary ten - fold in their affinity for actin . The W500S mutation caused a five - fold reduction in the ability of WASP - WA to activate the Arp2 / 3 complex , and the wild - type level of activation was not reached even at high concentrations ( Fig . 3b ) .

Therefore , 4 nM was taken as maximal activation for WASP - WA ( R477K ) . © 2000 Macmillan Magazines Ltd articles NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOL 3 JANUARY 2001 http : / / cellbio . nature . com 80 in their ability to stimulate nucleation , in spite of exhibiting wild - type affinities for actin monomers and the Arp2 / 3 complex . WASP - WA ( D485N ) showed wild - type nucleation activity , whereas WASP - WA ( K476E ) was twice as effective and WASP - WA ( R477K ) was severely defective . Even at high concentrations , WASP - WA ( R477K ) did not activate the Arp2 / 3 complex to the same extent as did the wild - type WA domain , indicating that this mutant may be defective in an activation step that is distinct from binding to the Arp2 / 3 com - plex or to actin monomers . Although their ability to activate the Arp2 / 3 complex was low , high concentrations of WASP - WA ( R477K ) or WASP - WA ( W500S ) promoted the formation of actin - filament branches , as did the wild - type WA domain ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S1a – d ) . WAS mutants may also be defective in their ability to bind to WASP - GBD 15 , but all three WAS mutants bound to WASP - GBD in a pull - down assay ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S1e ) . Discussion Fluorescence anisotropy binding experiments , titration calorimetry and actin - polymerization assays have yielded many quantitative insights regarding the interaction of the WA domain of WASP and Scar with actin monomers and the Arp2 / 3 complex . Rhodamine labelling of the WA domain for fluorescence anisotropy increases its affinity for actin monomers and the Arp2 / 3 complex , but this was circumvented by competition assays using unlabelled constructs . The WA domain binds to one actin monomer in an equilibrium with rapid on / off rates and a K d of 0 . 6 m M . This confirms the val - ues for the binding constant measured using inhibition of pointed - end elongation by the WA domain 8 , 23 . Both the WH - 2 and CA sequences contribute to binding to actin monomers , and the effects of point mutations indicate that the QLNK motif is important . As profilin and thymosin - b 4 compete with the WA domain for bind - ing to actin , and as WASP - WA – actin behaves like profilin – actin 8 , 23 , the WA - binding site on actin is likely to include domain - 1 . The lack of influence of latrunculin B on binding of the WA domain to actin is consistent with the idea that the binding site for latrunculin A is between the two lobes of actin 33 . Rhodamine – WASP - WA dissoci - ates from actin with a rate constant of 3 s – 1 . The dissociation rate constant of unlabelled WA domain should be about ten times faster , as the equilibrium constant of the unlabelled domain is weaker and it is reasonable to assume that the label does not affect the association rate constant . Therefore , at equilibrium , WASP - WA cycles on and off actin monomers on a subsecond time scale . As most unpolymerized actin in cells is bound to thymosin - b 4 or profilin , WASP - family proteins must compete with these proteins for the actin monomers required for the Arp2 / 3 complex to nucleate new actin filaments . All three ligands bind to ATP – actin monomers with similar K d values ( 0 . 1 – 0 . 8 m M ) , and all three reactions are rapid equilibria 25 , 34 . Thus , ATP – actin monomers will rapidly equilibrate among these ligands by mass action . As the concentrations of profil - in ( 25 – 100 m M ) and thymosin - b 4 ( up to 500 m M in platelets ) are higher than that of WASP ( 10 m M in neutrophils 22 ) , only a small frac - tion of unpolymerized actin is likely to be bound to WASP . By several criteria , free Scar - WA constructs are not compactly folded and binding to actin is driven almost entirely by a favourable change in enthalpy ( D H = – 10 kcal mol – 1 ) . The entropy change is unfavourable , in spite of the fact that the negative D C p indicates a hydrophobic effect , with solvent dissociating from proteins when they bind . This gives a favourable , positive D S solvent for the solvent . The total D S = D S solvent + D S config . , where D S config . is the entropy change in the proteins . Thus , the entropy change of the WA domain itself upon binding to actin ( D S config . ) must be unfavourable and strongly negative . Together with the fact that the free WA domain has little secondary structure , this is strong evidence that it has a more restricted conformation when bound to actin . The WA domain binds to the Arp2 / 3 complex with submicro - molar affinity , similar to its affinity for actin , although the two interactions differ in all other ways tested . Equilibrium exchange of WASP - WA with the Arp2 / 3 complex is 50 times slower than with actin . Assuming that the association rate constants are the same for labelled and unlabelled WASP - WA , the threefold lower affinity of unlabelled WASP - WA for the Arp2 / 3 complex indicates that the dissociation rate constant is ~ 0 . 6 s – 1 . We did not measure the ther - modynamic parameters , but expect , given the paucity of secondary structure in the free WA domain , that binding to the Arp2 / 3 com - plex will also be driven by a change in enthalpy rather than a change in entropy . Both the C and A sequences , but not the WH2 peptide , con - tribute to binding to the Arp2 / 3 complex . The binding sites for actin and the Arp2 / 3 complex in the C region may therfore overlap , raising the possibility that these two ligands compete for binding . However , the anisotropy of rhodamine – WASP - WA in an excess of the Arp2 / 3 complex is higher when actin is also present , indicating that the two ligands can bind simultaneously . Interactions with the Arp2 / 3 complex are critically dependent upon the last three residues in the C terminus of the WA domain , which are readily lost during preparation of this domain from glutathione - S - transferase ( GST ) - fusion proteins . Neither profilin nor actophorin competes for binding to the Arp2 / 3 complex . A crucial finding is that actin filaments enhance binding of the Arp2 / 3 complex to the WA domain .

The Arp2 / 3 complex enhances actin nucleation , the rate - limiting step in polymerization . However , the Arp2 / 3 complex alone is inac - tive and requires activation by ActA or WASP / Scar proteins . Here we have provided several insights into this activation mechanism . The WA domain activates actin - filament nucleation by the Arp2 / 3 complex , whereas other domains ( WH - 2 , C , CA and A ) or mixtures of these separate domains have minimal or no activity in spite of their residual affinity for either actin or the Arp2 / 3 com - plex . The simplest hypothesis to explain activation is that the WA domain stabilizes binding of an actin monomer to the Arp2 / 3 com - plex ( Fig . 1b ) . A new barbed end may simply grow from a trimeric nucleating assembly consisting of an actin monomer , Arp2 and Arp3 . Filaments may promote nucleation by enhancing binding of the WA domain to the Arp2 / 3 complex , prolonging the lifetime of the actin – WASP - WA – Arp2 / 3 complex to favour the formation of a productive nucleus . Much is explained by the hypothesis that the WA domain serves as an adaptor to bring together an actin monomer and the Arp2 / 3 com - plex , but the lack of correlation between the affinities of mutant WASP - WA constructs for actin and the Arp2 / 3 complex and their ability to activate actin nucleation by the Arp2 / 3 complex shows that nucleation must involve further activation steps that occur subse - quent to binding . Although neither of the WAS mutations K476E or R477K alters affinity for actin or for the Arp2 / 3 complex , WASP - WA ( K476E ) activates actin nucleation by the Arp2 / 3 complex better than the wild - type , whereas WASP - WA ( R477K ) has reduced activity . Similarly , our mutation N445K causes a fourfold increase in affinity for actin , wild - type affinity for the Arp2 / 3 complex and slightly enhanced ability to activate nucleation by the Arp2 / 3 complex , where - as our mutation K446T gives rise to a threefold reduction in affinity for actin , wild - type affinity for the Arp2 / 3 complex and slightly enhanced activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex . Rhodamine labelling of WASP - 429 - WA shows that increased affinity for actin and the Arp2 / 3 complex reduces , rather than enhances , nucleation by the Arp2 / 3 complex . Even mutant WASP - WA ( W500S ) , which has highly reduced affinity for the Arp2 / 3 complex , can stimulate nucleation at high con - centrations . Finally , it will be interesting to learn why dimeric GST – WASP - WA and full - length WASP activate the Arp2 / 3 complex 100 times more effectively than the monomeric WA domain 22 . All of these observations indicate a delicate balance between affinity and dynamics when WASP activates nucleation by the Arp2 / 3 complex . As WASP and ActA immobilized on beads can drive Arp2 / 3 - complex - dependent assembly of an actin - filament halo 14 , 35 , these activators must dissociate from the Arp2 / 3 complex soon after initiating nucleation . The rapid dissociation of the WA domain from both actin and the Arp2 / 3 complex observed here account for these observations . Further information is still needed to understand the activation mechanism and the physiological defects caused by WAS mutations . Methods Protein preparation . Ca - ATP – actin was purified from an acetone powder of rabbit skeletal muscle and monomers were purified by gel filtration on Sephacryl S - 300 in G - buffer ( 2 mM Tris – HCl pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 1mM CaCl 2 and 0 . 5mM dithiothreitol ) 36 . Actin was labelled with pyrenyliodoacetamide ( Molecular Probes ) 32 . Mg - ATP – actin was prepared by incubating Ca - ATP – actin with 0 . 1mM MgCl 2 and 1 . 0mM EGTA for 2 min at room temperature immediately before each measurement . Recombinant human - platelet profilin - I and actophorin were purified from Escherichia coli 37 . Thymosin - b 4 was a gift from S . Zigmond ( Univ . Pennsylvania ) . The Arp2 / 3 complex was purified from bovine thymus 8 , 22 . Human Scar1 - WA ( residues 495 – 559 ) was expressed in E . coli from the pMW vector . Cells were lysed by soni - cation and Scar1 - WA in the soluble fraction was purified to homogeneity by gel filtration in 100mM KCl , 1mM sodium azide , 0 . 5mM EDTA and 10mM Tris – HCl pH 8 . 0 and ion - exchange chromatogra - phy on diethylaminoethyl ( DEAE ) – cellulose with elution on a gradient of 100 – 500mM KCl . Scar1 - WA has a predicted M r of 7 , 646 . 3 ; mass spectroscopy gave a single peak corresponding to M r 7 , 650 . Preparation and labelling of WASP - WA . DNA corresponding to the C terminus of human WASP ( residues 429 – 502 ) was amplified from a cloned complementary DNA 10 by polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) with a forward primer containing an additional N - terminal cysteine codon . Cys – WASP - WA was cloned into pGEX 2T ( Amersham ) and expressed in BL21 ( DE3 ) pLysS E . coli . Fusion protein was purified by glutathione – Sepharose affinity chromatography ( Amersham ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . WASP - WA peptide was cleaved from GST by incubation for 2h at 4 (cid:176) C with 2 . 5NIH units of bovine thrombin ( Calbiochem ) per mg of immobilized GST – WASP - WA . Thrombin was inactivated with 1 mM phenylmethylsulpho - nyl fluoride ( PMSF ) . Thrombin cleavage removes two or more C - terminal residues from a substantial fraction of WASP - WA . These inactive degradation products are not resolved from full - length WASP - WA by SDS – PAGE , but can be separated by MonoQ chromatography ( Amersham ) equilibrated with TBSE ( 10mM Tris – HCl pH 8 . 0 , 100mM NaCl and 1 mM EDTA ) and eluted with a gradient of 100 – 400mM NaCl . The – SH of unlabelled WASP - WA was reacted with a fivefold molar excess of N - ethyl maleimide . GST – WASP - WA constructs attached to glutathione beads were labelled by incubating 1ml of a 50 % resin suspension overnight at 4 (cid:176) C in 1 . 6 mM tetramethylrhodamine - 5 ¢ - maleimide ( Molecular Probes ) in TBSE . The resin was washed extensively with TBSE . Rhodamine – WASP - WA was released by cleavage with 15U thrombin per mg of protein , and purified further as described for the unlabelled protein . Electrospray mass spectrometry at the Scripps Research Institute gave M r values of 8 , 648 for rhodamine – WASP - 429 - WA , 8 , 820 for rhodamine – WASP - 427 - WA , 9 , 061 for rhodamine – WASP - 424 - WA and 10 , 636 for rhodamine – WASP - 406 - WA , confirming that each purified peptide was intact and 100 % labelled with a single dye . Concentrations of unlabelled and labelled WASP - WA were determined by absorbance . The extinc - tion coefficient of 44 , 656 M – 1 cm – 1 at 552nm of rhodamine – WASP - WA was determined by Raleigh interference and absorption in a Beckman XLI analytical ultracentrifuge . For unlabelled WASP - WA , an extinction coefficient of 5 , 690 M – 1 cm – 1 at 280nm was calculated by the same method . Preparation of WASP - WA mutants . An Eco RI site present next to the 443QLNK446 motif of WASP was used to generate mutations Q443R , N445K and K446T by PCR using primers carrying point mutations and Eco RI sites . Amplified fragments were cloned into pGEX 2T WASP - WA digested by Eco RI . The W500S mutant was engi - neered by amplification of WASP - WA using a reverse primer carrying the point mutation . Wiskott – Aldrich - syndrome mutations K476E , R477K and D485N were generated by reverse PCR mutagenesis 38 . Mutations were verified by DNA sequencing . Fluorescence anisotropy . Anisotropy measurements were made with an Alpha - scan spectrofluorimeter ( Photon Technology International , Santa Clara , California ) with samples in KMEI buffer ( 10mM imidazole pH7 . 0 , 50mM KCl , 1mM EGTA and 1mM MgCl 2 ) 25 . Fixed concentrations of rhodamine – WASP - WA were mixed with various concentrations of actin or of the Arp2 / 3 complex . Rhodamine was excited with polarized light at 552nm and the emitted light was detected at 574nm through both horizontal and vertical polarizers . Measurements were made at 1 - s intervals for 20s , and the average anisotropy was calculated using PTI Felix software . Dissociation - equilibrium constants ( K d ) were calculated by fitting equation ( 1 ) to the ligand - concentration dependence of the anisotropy . ( 1 ) where r f is the anisotropy value of free rhodamine – WASP - WA , r b is the anisotropy of rhodamine – WASP - WA bound to ligand , [ W ] is the concentration of rhodamine – WASP - WA , and [ L ] is the concentration of ligand ( actin or the Arp2 / 3 complex ) . Competition experiments . In experiments in which a non - fluorescent ligand competed with rhodamine – WASP - WA for binding to actin or to the Arp2 / 3 complex , equation ( 2 ) was fitted to the dependence of anisotropy on the con - centration of competitor . ( 2 ) where K d is the dissociation - equilibrium constant of labelled WASP - WA and actin or the Arp2 / 3 com - plex , [ L ] is the total concentration of either actin or the Arp2 / 3 complex , [ C ] is the concentration of competing ligand , and K 2 is the K d of the competing ligand for actin or for the Arp2 / 3 complex . Dissociation kinetics . The time course of dissociation of rhodamine – WASP - WA from actin or from the Arp2 / 3 complex was determined by recording the reduction in anisotropy after mixing equilibrated samples of rho - damine – WASP - WA bound either to actin or to the Arp2 / 3 complex with a 100 – 200 - fold molar excess of Scar - WA 25 , using a KinTek stopped - flow mixer with a dead time of ~ 7ms . The time course of anisotropy change followed a single exponential . Assay of actin - filament nucleation . The time course of actin polymerization was used to assess the ability of WASP - WA constructs to acti - vate nucleation by the Arp2 / 3 complex 8 . Reactions contained 4 m M Mg - ATP – actin monomers ( 5 % pyrene - labelled ) , 10 nM bovine thymus Arp2 / 3 complex and a range of WASP - WA concentrations all in KMEI buffer . Polymerization was followed by fluorescence with excitation at 365nm and emission at 407nm . At every time point the rate of polymerization is equal to k + ( ends ) ( actin monomers ) , where k + is the association rate constant ( 10 m M – 1 s – 1 ) . The concentration of ends at the maximum polymer - r = r f + ( r b - r f ) / [ ( K d ( [ C ] + K 2 ) / K 2 [ L ] ) + 1 ] r = r f + ( r b - r f ) ( K d + [ W ] + [ L ] ) – ( K d + [ W ] + [ L ] ) 2 – ( 4 [ W ] [ L ] ) 2 © 2000 Macmillan Magazines Ltd articles NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOL 3 JANUARY 2001 http : / / cellbio . nature . com 82 ization rate was calculated . The products of these nucleation reactions were observed by fluorescence microscopy 3 . Isothermal titration calorimetry . The heat produced during binding of Scar1 - WA to actin monomers was measured with an Omega titration calorimeter ( MicroCal Inc . , Northampton , Massachusetts ) with a 1 . 4 - ml reaction cell . Scar1 - WA was injected in 5 - m l aliquots into an actin solution . To allow for accurate determination of the bio - chemical standard - state enthalpy change upon binding , we chose concentrations of reactants such that the product ( K a · initial actin concentration · stoichiometry ) was > > 1 ( 10 – 100 in our experiments ) . Buffers and temperatures were as described in the text . Heats of dilution of Scar1 - WA into actin satu - rated with WASP - WA were subtracted from each injection heat . Origin software from MicroCal was used to determine peak areas and to analyse the data ; the entropy change ( D S ) was calculated using D G = D H – T D S . Circular - dichroism spectroscopy . Circular - dichroism spectra of WASP - WA and Scar1 - WA in 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer , pH 7 . 2 , were collected at 25 (cid:176) C with an Aviv Model 62DS spectropolarimeter , using the manufacturer’s soft - ware . Spectra were deconvoluted using four methods 39 – 42 . RECEIVED 31 MAY 2000 ; REVISED 17 JULY 2000 ; ACCEPTED 11 SEPTEMBER 2000 ; PUBLISHED 7 DECEMBER 2000 . 1 . Machesky , L . M . , Atkinson , S .
