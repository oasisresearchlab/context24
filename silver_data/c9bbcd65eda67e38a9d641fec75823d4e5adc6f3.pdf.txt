As a highly conserved developmental event crucial for the nervous system formation , neural induction , for example , leads to differentiation of the ectoderm into a patterned tissue , con - taining the neuroectoderm ( neural plate , or NP ) and the epidermal ectoderm separated by the neural plate border ( NPB ) ( Fig . 1a ) 6 , 7 . Classic embryological studies of neural induction have unravelled the importance of graded developmental signalling mediated by diffusible signals such as bone morphogenetic proteins ( BMPs ) ( Fig . 1a ) 8 – 10 . However , neural induction , like any tissue - scale mor - phogenetic event , occurs within the milieu of biophysical determi - nants , including changes in shape , number , position and force of cells 7 , 11 . Yet it remains undetermined how these tissue - scale mor - phogenetic changes work in concert with classic developmental signaling events mediated by diffusible signals for proper cell fate patterning during neural induction . hPS cells , which reside in a developmental state similar to the pluripotent epiblast 12 , 13 , have been successfully used for the devel - opment of self - organized models of human embryonic develop - ment 14 – 21 . To date , however , no neural induction models exist that leverage hPS cells and their innate self - organizing properties to study neuroectoderm patterning . Here , we sought to develop micropatterned hPS - cell colonies on two - dimensional substrates to model neural induction . Microcontact printing was utilized to gen - erate vitronectin - coated , circular adhesive islands with a diameter of 400 µ m on flat poly - dimethylsiloxane ( PDMS ) surfaces coated on glass coverslips ( Fig . 1a and Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . H1 human embryonic stem ( hES ) cells were plated as single cells at 20 , 000 cells cm − 2 on adhesive islands to establish micropatterned colonies with a defined circular shape and size . A differentiation medium supplemented with the dual SMAD inhibitors , SB 431542 ( SB , TGF - β inhibitor ; 10 µ M ) and LDN 193189 ( LDN , BMP4 inhibitor ; 500 nM ) , was applied for neural induction 22 ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ; see Methods ) . The β - catenin stabilizer CHIR 99021 ( CHIR , 3 µ M ) , a WNT activator , was also supplemented in culture ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . CHIR promotes NPB cell specification under the neural induction condition established by the dual SMAD inhibitors 23 , 24 . Although cells distributed uniformly on adhesive islands 24 h after initial cell plating , neural induction resulted in differentiat - ing cells gradually accumulating in the colony central area , lead - ing to a significantly greater cell density at the colony centre than at the periphery ( Fig . 1b and Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . Cell density was further analysed using DAPI fluorescence intensity . The full width at half maximum ( FWHM ) for spatial distributions of DAPI intensity decreased continuously from 336 µ m at day 1 to 240 µ m at day 9 ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . Confocal images further showed that micropatterned colonies at day 7 remained as a monolayer . Strikingly , quantitation of colony thickness and nucleus shape revealed that at this point , cells exhibited a gradual change of cell shape from a columnar phenotype with columnar nuclei at the col - ony centre to a cuboidal morphology with rounded nuclei at the colony periphery ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) , consistent with character - istic neuroectoderm thickening during neural induction in vivo 6 , 11 .

However , it remains unresolved how mechanics , as an integral driver of development , is involved in controlling tissue - scale cell fate patterning . Here we report a micropatterned human pluripotent stem ( hPS ) - cell - based neuroectoderm developmental model , in which pre - patterned geometrical confinement induces emergent patterning of neuroepithelial and neural plate border cells , mimicking neuroectoderm regionalization during early neurulation in vivo . In this hPS - cell - based neuroectoderm pattern - ing model , two tissue - scale morphogenetic signals—cell shape and cytoskeletal contractile force—instruct neuroepithelial / neural plate border patterning via BMP - SMAD signalling . We further show that ectopic mechanical activation and exogenous BMP signalling modulation are sufficient to perturb neuroepithelial / neural plate border patterning . This study provides a use - ful microengineered , hPS - cell - based model with which to understand the biomechanical principles that guide neuroectoderm patterning and hence to study neural development and disease . © 2018 Macmillan Publishers Limited , part of Springer Nature .

Interestingly , the concentric zone of Pax3 + cells at the colony periphery exhibited a smaller zone width , as character - ized by FWHM for spatial distribution of Pax3 intensity ( 92 µ m ) , compared with concentric zones of Zic1 + ( 128 µ m ) and Msx1 + ( 175 µ m ) cells , respectively ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . This observa - tion is consistent with in vivo findings that ZIC1 + cells also exist in the neurogenic placode region 25 . Immunostaining and immunob - lotting of E - cadherin and N - cadherin at day 2 and day 7 further confirmed successful neural conversion ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . To confirm differentiation potentials of neuroectoderm tissues after neural induction , they were continuously cultured under a motor neuron differentiation medium 26 or a neural crest differentiation medium 23 , 24 ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) .

We next sought to examine the effect of colony size on self - organized neuroectoderm patterning . To this end , circular adhesive islands with diameters of 300 , 400 , 500 and 800 µ m were fabricated and compared . Neural induction resulted in the emergence of con - centric , ring - shaped neuroectoderm tissues with proper regional - ization of NE and NPB cells at day 9 for all colonies ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . Interestingly , the Pax6 + NE circular pattern size and the con - centric zone width of Pax3 + NPB cells , as characterized by FWHM for spatial distributions of Pax6 and Pax3 intensities , respectively , appeared relatively constant for colony diameters of 300 – 500 µ m ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . Notably , neural induction for colonies with a diameter of 800 µ m led to marked cell accumulation at the colony periphery on day 9 , coinciding with a notable number of Pax3 + , Zic1 + and Msx1 + NPB cells at the colony central region ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . The underlying mechanism leading to this different cell fate distribution remains unclear , and probably involves second - ary tissue morphogenesis 18 . We further examined neuroectoderm patterning in circular colonies of 400 µ m in diameter under two other initial cell seeding density conditions ( 5 , 000 cells cm − 2 and 30 , 000 cells cm − 2 ) . A seeding density of 5 , 000 cells cm − 2 led to abnor - mal neuroectoderm regionalization . Even though a notable num - ber of Pax6 + NE cells appeared at the colony centre , Pax3 + , Zic1 + and Msx1 + NPB cells were evident across entire colonies without distinct spatial patterning ( Supplementary Fig . 5 ) . Plating cells at 30 , 000 cells cm − 2 led to the development of multilayered cellular structures by day 9 , even though Pax3 + NPB cells still appeared and formed a single peripheral layer enveloping the colony top surface ( Supplementary Fig . 5 ) . Together , we identified micropatterned cir - cular colonies of 300 – 500 µ m in diameter and an initial cell seed - ing density of 20 , 000 cells cm − 2 as the most suitable conditions for in vitro modelling of neural induction ( referred to henceforth as the ‘default neural induction’ condition ) . Emergent patterning of neuroectoderm tissues with proper autonomous regionaliza - tion of NE and NPB cells was also achieved using another hES cell line ( H9 ) and a human induced pluripotent stem ( hiPS ) cell line ( Supplementary Fig . 6 ) . We further conducted live - cell assays to examine dynamic neu - roectoderm patterning using a Sox10 - EGFP bacterial artificial chromosome hES cell reporter line ( H9 ) 23 . SOX10 is a specifier gene for neural crest induction at the NPB in vertebrates 27 . Surprisingly , under the default neural induction condition , GFP + cells emerged first at the colony periphery on day 6 and continuously increased in number there through day 7 and day 8 ( Fig . 1d ) . This observation was further corroborated by immunofluorescence analysis to exam - ine initial appearances and spatial distributions of Pax6 + NE and Pax3 + NPB cells ( Supplementary Fig . 7 ) . Together , the time course of expression of NPB markers Pax3 , Zic1 and Msx1 and neural crest marker Sox10 in micropatterned hES cell colonies is consistent with mouse embryo development in vivo 27 – 29 . To examine a possible role of cell sorting in neuroectoderm pat - terning , live - cell imaging was conducted for tracking cell migratory behaviours . Migration of cells , whether located at the colony centre or at peripheral region , was very limited under the default neural induction condition , with an average radial displacement less than 20 µ m between days 2 and 4 ( Supplementary Fig . 8 ) . Furthermore , cell migration could be well simulated using an unbiased random walk model ( Supplementary Fig . 8 ; see Methods ) . Thus , cell sorting was unlikely to be responsible for emergent regional neuroectoderm patterning in micropatterned colonies . Together , our data support that autonomous regionalization of NE and NPB cells should prob - ably be attributed to cell - fate - determinant , position - dependent information perceived by differentiating cells that dictates the bifur - cation dynamics of NE and NPB lineage commitments . Gradual cell accumulation at the colony centre ( Fig . 1b ) sug - gests cell rearrangement and dynamic morphogenetic processes . Indeed , colonies stained for ZO - 1 for visualization of cell – cell junc - tions revealed that at day 4 , cells at the colony periphery displayed a greater projected area than at the colony centre ( Supplementary Fig . 9 , Supplementary Fig . 10 , and Fig . 2a , b ) . Compared with those at the colony centre , cells at the colony periphery also displayed greater intracellular cytoskeletal contractility , as revealed by stron - ger staining for phosphorylated myosin and greater traction stress quantitated using PDMS micropost force sensors 30 ( Fig . 2a , c and Supplementary Fig . 9 ; see Methods ) . Supplementing neural induc - tion medium with blebbistatin ( 10 µ M ) , which inhibits myosin motor activity and thus cytoskeletal contractility , effectively elimi - nated spatial differences in projected area or traction stress between colony peripheral and central regions at day 4 ( Supplementary Fig . 10 and Fig . 2a – c ) . We note that blebbistatin treatment did not result in notable cell toxicity ( Supplementary Fig . 11 ) . However , it decreased cell proliferation and thus effectively increased the cell spreading area at the colony central area ( Supplementary Fig . 11 ) . Importantly , even though NE and NBP cells still appeared at day 9 with blebbistatin treatment , proper neuroectoderm regionaliza - tion was severely impaired , with abundant Pax3 + , Zic1 + and Msx1 + NPB cells randomly distributed across entire colonies ( Fig . 2d ) . Reducing cell seeding density under default neural induction con - ditions to 5 , 000 cells cm − 2 also caused more uniform spatial distri - butions of projected area and traction stress across entire colonies ( Supplementary Fig . 10 ) . Our results in Fig . 2 suggested critical roles of morphogenetic cues in mediating neuroectoderm patterning with proper region - alization . Neural induction in vivo has been shown to be mediated through graded BMP signalling 8 – 10 , 31 . Specifically , a BMP signalling gradient provides positional information in the ectoderm , with high BMP activity promoting epidermal differentiation , low BMP for NP development , and intermediate BMP for NPB specification 8 – 10 , 31 ( Fig . 1a ) . Indeed , we observed strong correlations between spatial regulations of cell shape , cytoskeletal contractility and BMP activ - ity at day 4 . Most cells at the colony periphery showed prominent nuclear staining of phosphorylated SMAD 1 / 5 ( p - SMAD 1 / 5 ) , a downstream target of BMP - SMAD signalling , whereas far fewer cells at the colony central area were p - SMAD 1 / 5 nuclear positive ( Fig . 3a , b ) . Interestingly , blebbistatin treatment or plating cells at 5 , 000 cells cm − 2 rescued BMP activity at the colony central area on day 4 ( Fig . 3a , b ) , consistent with their effects on promoting NPB differentiation at the colony central region . Replacing LDN in the default neural induction condition with NOGGIN ( 100 ng ml − 1 ) , a protein that antagonizes BMPs , or dorsomorphin ( 1 µ M ) , which inhibits BMP receptors , led to similar results of graded SMAD tran - scriptional activation at day 4 and neuroectoderm regionalization at day 9 ( Supplementary Fig . 12 ) . To specifically examine the functional roles of cell shape and cyto - skeletal contractility in BMP activation , microcontact printing was applied to obtain patterned circular single hES cells with prescribed spreading areas ( Supplementary Fig . 13 and Fig . 3c ) . Cytoskeletal contractility of patterned single hES cells correlated positively with spreading area ( Supplementary Fig . 13 ) . Importantly , the percent - age of patterned single hES cells with dominant nuclear staining of p - SMAD 1 / 5 also increased with spreading area ( Fig . 3c , d ) . Furthermore , quantitative polymerase chain reaction with reverse transcription ( qRT - PCR ) analysis revealed greater expression levels of BMP target genes MSX1 , ID1 and ID3 in patterned single hES cells with greater spreading areas ( Supplementary Fig . 13 ) . Similar observations about BMP target genes were also obtained when seeding hES cells on vitronectin - coated flat PDMS surfaces at dif - ferent plating densities to effectively modulate spreading area and cytoskeletal contractility ( Supplementary Fig . 13 ) . © 2018 Macmillan Publishers Limited , part of Springer Nature .

NAtuRe MAteRIALS | VOL 17 | JULY 2018 | 633 – 641 | www . nature . com / naturematerials 635 Articles NATure MATerIAlS To further investigate the causal link between cell shape and mechanical force and neuroectoderm patterning , a custom - designed microfluidic cell stretching device was developed and implemented for stretching central regions of micropatterned cell colonies 32 ( Fig . 4a and Supplementary Fig . 14 ) . Continuous stretch - ing with a square - wave pattern ( pulse width of 2 h and period of 4 h ) and a 100 % stretch amplitude was applied starting from day 2 under the default neural induction condition ( Supplementary Fig . 14 ) . Indeed , mechanical stretching enhanced cytoskeletal contractility at the colony central region , as reflected by stronger staining of phos - phorylated myosin and actin filaments , compared to unstretched controls ( Fig . 4b ) . Furthermore , stretching of the colony central area effectively rescued nuclear p - SMAD 1 / 5 and thus BMP activity at the colony central region ( Fig . 4c , d ) . By day 8 , a significant number of Pax3 + NPB cells were evident at the colony centre , whereas NE differentiation was completely inhibited there ( Fig . 4e ) . Together , these results unambiguously demonstrate that cell shape and mechanical force can directly activate BMP - SMAD signalling and thus repress NE but promote NPB differentiation . We next modified the neural induction medium to elucidate the role of BMP signalling in guiding neuroectoderm patterning . Specifically , modulating LDN concentration in neural induction medium resulted in a dose - dependent BMP signalling response . With high - dose LDN ( 1 µ M ) , BMP - SMAD signalling was com - pletely repressed across entire colonies at day 4 ( Supplementary Fig . 15 ) . Without LDN supplementation , most cells across entire colonies showed prominent nuclear p - SMAD 1 / 5 at day 4 , consis - tent with BMP activity - inducing properties of the KnockOut Serum I n t en s i t y m ap S t a i n i ng i m age a p - Myosin ZO - 1 Actin P e r i phe r a l C en t r a l Micropost B l eb C on t r o l ZIC1 DAPI PAX3 MSX1 PAX6 B l eb P e r i phe r a l C en t r a l d 10 nN b c T r a c t i on s t r e ss m ap Bleb Control 0 – 3 ( kPa ) 0 – 1 ( a r b i t r a r y un i t s ) P = 4 . 19 ×10 – 10 0 400 800 1 , 200 1 , 600 0 1 , 000 2 , 000 3 , 000 Bleb Control P = 0 . 582 n cell = 773 n cell = 2 , 201 n cell = 1 , 070 n cell = 198 n colony = 30 n colony = 30 n colony = 30 n colony = 37 n colony = 16 n colony = 19 n colony = 19 C e ll a r ea ( µ m 2 ) C en t r a l P e r i phe r a l C en t r a l P e r i phe r a l Fig . 2 | Self - organization of morphogenetic factors controls neuroectoderm patterning . a , Representative fluorescence images showing staining for ZO - 1 , phosphorylated myosin ( p - myosin ) and actin , as well as micropost sensors at colony peripheral and central regions at day 4 . hPS cells were cultured in neural induction medium supplemented with either DMSO ( control ) or blebbistatin ( Bleb ; 10 µ M ) .

Similarly , replacing LDN with BMP4 ( 25 ng ml − 1 ) in neural induction medium , a condition that promotes BMP signalling , induced prominent nuclear accumulation of p - SMAD 1 / 5 across entire colonies ( Fig . 5a , b ) . Consequently , by day 9 at colony centre , NE differentiation was completely inhibited , whereas NPB differentiation was drastically promoted ( Fig . 5c ) .

Consistently , NPB differentiation across entire colonies by day 9 was completely suppressed ( Fig . 5c ) . Gene expression analysis further confirmed the effect of replacing KSR with Essential 6 on repressing BMP4 expression ( Supplementary Fig . 16 ) . However , replacing LDN with BMP4 in the default neural induction medium upregulated both BMP4 and NOGGIN expression ( but not BMP2 , BMP6 or BMP7 ) , consistent with previous reports 21 , 35 ( Supplementary Fig . 16 ) . Interestingly , silencing of BMP4 or NOGGIN expression using siRNA did not affect neuroectoderm regionalization in micropatterned colonies ( Supplementary Fig . 17 ) , excluding endogenous BMP4 or NOGGIN for instructing NE / NPB patterning . We further seeded hES cells on flat PDMS surfaces uni - formly coated with vitronectin at a low ( 5 , 000 cells cm − 2 ) or high ( 50 , 000 cells cm − 2 ) density condition . Consistent with our previ - ous data , the high density condition significantly down - regulated expression of NPB markers PAX3 and SOX9 compared with the low density condition ( Supplementary Fig . 18 ) . However , exogenously activating BMP by supplementing BMP4 ( 25 ng ml − 1 ) effectively rescued both PAX3 and SOX9 expression ( Supplementary Fig . 18 ) . Altogether , our data suggest that morphogenetic cues during emer - gent neuroectoderm patterning may function upstream of BMP - SMAD signalling to regulate its transcriptional activation ( Fig . 5d ) . Exogenous BMP activation can rescue inhibitory effects of confined cell shape ( or small cell spreading area ) and impaired cytoskeletal contractile force on BMP signalling . a c Peripheral Central D AP I p - S M A D 1 / 5 P e r c en t age o f c e ll s w i t h nu c l ea r p - S M A D 1 / 5 30 60 90 Unstretched ( n colony = 27 ) Stretch ( n colony = 22 ) 0 Distance from colony centroid ( µ m ) 0 – 50 50 – 100 100 – 150 150 – 200 b p - M y o s i n D AP I A c t i n Peripheral Central Peripheral Central Control Stretch Control Stretch d PDMS membrane Microchamber Before stretching During stretching Cells Vitronectin Cover slip Δ p d d / 2 D AP I PAX 3 PAX 6 e Intensity map Staining image Intensity map Staining image Control ( n colony = 25 ) Stretch ( n colony = 22 ) 0 – 1 ( arbitrary units ) Peripheral Central 4 . 9 × 10 – 4 4 . 2 × 10 – 7 0 . 0340 . 495 Fig . 4 | Mechanical force is sufficient for activating BMP - SMAD signalling and inducing NPB cell differentiation . a , Schematic of a microfluidic device to apply stretching forces to central zones of micropatterned hPS cell colonies . b , Representative fluorescence micrographs showing central and peripheral zones of unstretched ( control ) and stretched ( stretch ) micropatterned colonies at day 4 stained for p - myosin and actin .

Etoc et al . recently report a cell density - dependent mechanism for graded BMP signalling involving subcellular lateral - ization of BMP receptors and diffusion of endogenous NOGGIN 35 . To explore whether this mechanism might be involved in our model , tight - junction integrity was disrupted during neural induction by a brief calcium depletion followed by incubation with Y - 27632 ( 20 µ M ) , a ROCK ( Rho - associated protein kinase ) inhibitor , a condition known to prevent tight junction formation 35 , 36 ( Supplementary Fig . 19 ) . Such treatment has been shown to allow intercellular diffusion of apically delivered TGF - β ligands to bind basolateral receptors and thus restore downstream SMAD activity in high - density epithelial monolayers 35 , 36 . However , under this tight - junction disruption con - dition , proper neuroectoderm patterning was still achieved at day 9 ( Supplementary Fig . 19 ) , supporting that subcellular lateralization of BMP receptors was unlikely to be responsible for establishing graded BMP signalling in our model . c KSR + SB + LDN + CHIR ( control ) PAX 6 PAX 3 I n t en s i t y m ap S t a i n i ng i m a ge I n t en s i t y m ap S t a i n i ng i m age Stretching Confinement Neural plate border cell differentiation ( large cell shape and high contractility ) Neuroepithelial cell differentiation ( small cell shape and low contractility ) Low BMP activity High SMAD P A c t o m y o s i n p - SMAD P Colony centre Colony periphery Cross - sectional view Z oo m - i n p r o j e c t ed v i e w D AP I a p - S M A D 1 / 5 b KSR + SB + LDN + CHIR ( control ) – LDN + BMP4 ( BMP - HI ) – KSR + E6 ( BMP - LO ) – LDN + BMP4 ( BMP - HI ) – KSR + E6 ( BMP - LO ) d PAX3SOX9SOX10 BMP - HI ( n colony = 25 ) 1 . 39 × 10 – 5 1 . 78 × 10 – 5 0 . 001 0 . 846 0 . 002 0 . 007 5 . 2 × 10 – 4 2 . 14 × 10 – 5 0 20 40 60 80 100 Distance from colony centroid ( μ m ) P e r c en t age o f c e ll s w i t h nu c l ea r p - S m ad 1 / 5 Control ( n colony = 24 ) BMP - LO ( n colony = 21 ) n colony = 132 n colony = 57 n colony = 24 n colony = 30 n colony = 57 n colony = 24 0 – 1 ( a r b i t r a r y un i t s ) 0 – 50 50 – 100 100 – 150 150 – 200 PAX3SOX9SOX10 Fig . 5 | BMP - SMAD signalling is required for mechanics - guided neuroectoderm patterning . a , Representative immunofluorescence images showing colonies at day 4 stained for phosphorylated SMAD 1 / 5 ( p - SMAD 1 / 5 ) .

Increased cell shape and contractile force at colony periphery result in nuclear accumulation and transcriptional activation of p - SMAD 1 / 5 , which in turn up - regulates NPB specifier genes including PAX3 , SOX9 and SOX10 . Confined cell shape with limited contractile force at the colony centre leads to nuclear exclusion of p - SMAD 1 / 5 and neuroepithelial differentiation . Modulating cell shape by mechanical stretching or geometrical confinement can thus mediate BMP signalling to regulate neuroectoderm patterning . © 2018 Macmillan Publishers Limited , part of Springer Nature .

NAtuRe MAteRIALS | VOL 17 | JULY 2018 | 633 – 641 | www . nature . com / naturematerials 639 Articles NATure MATerIAlS Recent studies suggest that cell - density - dependent TGF - β inhi - bition in epithelial cells is due to crosstalk with the Hippo pathway 37 . The Hippo effector YAP / TAZ is also mechanosensitive and can be regulated by both cell shape and mechanical forces 38 , 39 . To examine the role of YAP / TAZ , a small molecular inhibitor cerivastatin ( CER ) , which promotes YAP phosphorylation and thus nuclear exclusion 40 , was supplemented in the default neural induction medium with LDN replaced with BMP4 ( 25 ng ml − 1 ) to promote BMP activity ( Supplementary Fig . 20 ) . Even though nuclear YAP was suppressed across entire colonies at day 4 , nuclear localization of p - SMAD 1 / 5 remained evident and all cells across entire colonies differentiated into Pax3 + NPB cells at day 9 . Thus , YAP nuclear translocation did not correlate with p - SMAD 1 / 5 response , and YAP was unlikely to directly regulate BMP - SMAD signalling and thus neuroectoderm patterning . It remains a future goal to determine how geometrical confinement leads to spontaneous self - organization of morphoge - netic factors , how cell shape and cytoskeletal contractility activate BMP - SMAD signalling 41 , and how BMP and WNT signals converge to regulate NPB specification 42 , 43 . Our micropatterned neuroectoderm developmental model does not contain non - neural ectoderm or mesenchymal tissues , which may have important roles in instructing neuroectoderm formation in vivo 8 – 10 . Nonetheless , there are well documented tissue isola - tion studies using in vivo models that support neural induction as an autonomous process 44 . The origin of NPB cells is also believed to arise from neural but not epidermal ectoderm 27 , 29 . Altogether , our neuroectoderm developmental model is useful for studying self - organizing principles involved in autonomous patterning and regionalization of neuroectoderm tissues . In this work , we demonstrate that autonomous patterning of neuroectoderm tissue with proper NP and NPB regionalization emerges de novo as the tissue physically takes shape and self - assem - bles in pre - patterned geometrical confinements . Self - organization of morphogenetic cues , including cell shape and cytoskeletal con - tractility , can directly feed back to mediate BMP activity and thus dictate spatial regulation of neuroectoderm patterning . Colony geometry can directly influence cell signalling and cell – cell com - munication through regulatory mechanisms involving dynamic morphogenetic cues and diffusible signals 17 , 18 , 20 , 21 , 35 . Such signalling crosstalk involving both biophysical and biochemical determinants may be important in controlling patterning networks to ensure the remarkable robustness and precision of tissue self - organization in vivo 1 – 5 . We envision that our neuroectoderm developmental model will facilitate future efforts in generating theoretical frameworks that integrate knowledge at the mechanical , cellular and gene - reg - ulatory levels 17 , 18 , 20 , 21 , 35 . Future mechanistic investigations of tissue mechanics - guided neuroectoderm patterning will therefore help advance the fundamental understanding of neural development and disease .

PluriQ Human Cell Conditioned Medium ( MTI - GlobalStem ) was used to support feeder - free growth of hPS cells 45 . The growth medium comprised DMEM / F12 ( GIBCO ) , 20 % KnockOut Serum Replacement ( KSR ; GIBCO ) , β - mercaptoethanol ( 0 . 1 mM ; GIBCO ) , glutamax ( 2 mM ; GIBCO ) , 1 % non - essential amino acids ( GIBCO ) , and human recombinant basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF , 4 ng ml − 1 ; GlobalStem ) as described previously 26 . The neural induction medium comprised growth medium , TGF - β inhibitor SB 431542 ( 10 µ M ; Cayman Chemical ) and BMP4 inhibitor LDN 193189 ( 500 nM ; Selleckchem ) 22 . At day 3 , CHIR99021 ( 3 µ M ; Cayman Chemical ) was added to the neural induction medium and was withdrawn at day 4 23 , 24 . The motor neuron differentiation medium comprised N2B27 medium , retinoic acid ( RA , 1 µ M ; Stemcell Technologies ) and smoothened agonist ( SAG , 500 nM ; Stemcell Technologies ) 26 . N2B27 medium comprised 1 : 1 mixture of DMEM / F12 and neurobasal medium ( GIBCO ) , 1 % N2 supplement ( GIBCO ) , 2 % B - 27 supplement ( GIBCO ) , 2 mM glutamax and 1 % non - essential amino acids . The neural crest cell differentiation medium comprised N2B27 medium and 3 µ M CHIR99021 23 , 24 . Culture medium was pre - equilibrated at 37 °C and 5 % CO 2 before use . Cell culture . Both H1 hES cell line ( WA01 , WiCell ; NIH registration number : 0043 ) and Sox10 - EGFP bacterial artificial chromosome hES cell reporter line ( H9 ; WA09 , WiCell ; NIH registration number : 0062 ) were cultured on mitotically inactive mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs ; GlobalStem ) in growth medium . Another H9 hES cell line was cultured using mTeSR1 medium ( Stemcell Technologies ) and lactate dehydrogenase - elevating virus ( LDEV ) - free hES cell - qualified reduced growth factor basement membrane matrix Geltrex ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) as described previously 19 . The hiPS cell line , a gift from P . H . Krebsbach , was cultured in PluriQ Human Cell Conditioned Medium on tissue culture dishes coated with poly [ 2 - ( methacryloyloxy ) ethyl dimethyl - ( 3 - sulfopropyl ) ammonium hydroxide ] 45 . The STEMPRO EZPassage Disposable Stem Cell Passaging Tool ( Invitrogen ) was used for passaging the H1 and Sox10 - EGFP hES cell lines every 5 d as described previously 26 . A modified pasteur pipette was used to remove differentiated cells under a stereomicroscope ( Olympus ) . After brief treatment with TrypLE Select ( Invitrogen ) to release MEFs , the remaining cells were collected using a cell scraper ( BD Biosciences ) before being transferred onto a tissue culture dish coated with gelatin ( Sigma ) and incubated for 45 min . Contaminating MEFs would attach to the dish . hES cells in suspension were then collected , centrifuged and re - dispersed in growth medium supplemented with Y27632 ( 10 µ M ; Enzo Life Sciences ) before cell seeding . For H9 hES and hiPS cells , cells were digested using TrypLE Select before cell seeding 19 . The Human Pluripotent Stem Cell Research Oversight Committee at the University of Michigan have approved all protocols for the use of hPS cells . All cell lines were authenticated by Cell Line Genetics as karyotypically normal and were tested negative for mycoplasma contamination using the LookOut Mycoplasma PCR Detection Kit ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . Microcontact printing . Soft lithography was used to generate patterned PDMS stamps from silicon moulds fabricated using photolithography and deep reactive - ion etching ( DRIE ) , as described previously 30 . These PDMS stamps were used to generate micropatterned cell colonies and patterned single cells using microcontact printing . Briefly , to generate patterned cell colonies and single cells on flat PDMS surfaces , round glass coverslips with a diameter of 18 mm ( Fisher Scientific ) were spin - coated ( Spin Coater ; Laurell Technologies ) with a thin layer of PDMS prepolymer comprising the PDMS base monomer and curing agent ( 10 : 1 w / w ; Sylgard 184 , Dow - Corning ) . PDMS was then thermally cured at 110 °C for at least 24 h . In parallel , PDMS stamps were immersed in a vitronectin solution ( 20 µ g ml − 1 ; Trevigen ) for 1 h before being blown dry under nitrogen . Vitronectin has been reported to support self - renewal of hPS cells 46 . Vitronectin - coated PDMS stamps were then placed in conformal contact with ultraviolet ozone - treated PDMS on coverslips ( ozone cleaner ; Jelight ) . After removing PDMS stamps , coverslips were sterilized using ethanol ( Fisher Scientific ) . Protein adsorption to PDMS surfaces not coated with vitronectin was prevented by immersing coverslips in 0 . 2 % Pluronics F127 NF solution ( BASF ) for 30 min . Coverslips were rinsed with PBS before placed into tissue culture plates for cell seeding . For micropatterned cell colonies , PDMS stamps containing circular patterns with diameters of 300 , 400 , 500 and 800 µ m were used . For patterned single cells , PDMS stamps containing circular patterns with diameters of 25 , 30 , 37 and 45 µ m were used . To apply continuous stretching to the central zone of micropatterned cell colonies , microcontact printing was performed to print circular adhesive patterns with a diameter of 400 µ m onto the deformable PDMS membrane on top of pressurization compartments ( with a diameter of 200 µ m ) in a custom - designed microfluidic cell stretching device . To this end , a custom desktop aligner designed for fabrication of multilayer microfluidic devices was used 47 . Briefly , the vitronectin - coated PDMS stamp and the microfluidic cell stretching device were mounted onto the top and bottom layer holders of the aligner , respectively . Under a digital microscope , the X / Y / θ stage holding the bottom layer holder was carefully adjusted to align the PDMS stamp and the microfluidic cell stretching device . The PDMS stamp was then gently pressed to achieve conformal contact with the microfluidic cell stretching device to transfer vitronectin from the stamp to the PDMS membrane on top of the pressurization compartments . Stencil micropatterning . The stencil was generated by punching through - holes into a PDMS membrane using a 500 µ m biopsy puncher ( Fisher Scientific ) . To generate the PDMS membrane , PDMS prepolymer was spun on a silicon wafer before PDMS was thermally cured at 60 °C for at least 24 h . The PDMS membrane was then peeled off the silicon wafer before punching through - holes into the membrane . Coverslips were immersed in a vitronectin solution ( 20 µ g ml − 1 ) for 1 h before the PDMS stencil was placed onto the coverslip for cell seeding . Immunocytochemistry . As described previously 26 , 4 % paraformaldehyde ( Electron Microscopy Sciences ) was used for cell fixation before permeabilization with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 ( Roche Applied Science ) . Primary antibodies listed in Supplementary Table 2 were then used for protein detection . For immunolabelling , goat - anti mouse AlexaFluor 488 and / or goat - anti rabbit AlexaFluor 546 secondary antibodies were used . To label actin microfilaments , AlexaFluor 555 conjugated phalloidin ( Invitrogen ) was used . Cells were stained with 4 , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ( DAPI ; Invitrogen ) to visualize the nucleus . Image analysis . Fluorescence images were recorded using either an inverted epifluorescence microscope ( Zeiss Axio Observer Z1 ; Carl Zeiss MicroImaging ) equipped with a monochrome charge - coupled device ( CCD ) camera or an Olympus DSUIX81 spinning disc confocal microscope equipped with an EMCCD camera ( iXon X3 , Andor ) . Fluorescence images of micropatterned cell colonies were first cropped using a custom - developed MATLAB program ( MathWorks ; https : / / www . mathworks . com / ) to a uniform circular size ( as defined by colony size ) with pattern centroids aligned . Owing to intrinsic inhomogeneous cell seeding , multilayered cellular structures would inevitably appear in micropatterned cell colonies . These multilayered colonies were excluded from data analyses . Fluorescence intensity of each pixel in cropped images was normalized by the maximum intensity identified in each image . These normalized images were stacked together to obtain average intensity maps . To normalize fluorescence intensities of cell lineage markers by DAPI intensity , the intensity of cell lineage markers for each pixel was divided by the corresponding DAPI intensity . These DAPI - normalized images were stacked together to obtain average DAPI - normalized intensity maps . To plot average intensity as a function of distance from colony centroid , average intensity maps for circular cell colonies were divided into 100 concentric zones with equal widths . The average pixel intensity in each concentric zone was calculated and plotted against the mean distance of the concentric zone from colony centroid . From average intensity plots of cell lineage markers , values of the FWHM were determined as the difference between the two radial positions at which the average fluorescence intensity of individual markers is equal to half of its maximum value . The FWHM for average DAPI intensity plots was determined by first calculating the half width at half maximum ( HWHM ) , which was determined as the radial position at which the average DAPI intensity is equal to half of its maximum value at the colony centroid . the FWHM for average DAPI intensity plots was then calculated as double the HWHM . Colony thickness and nucleus orientation were determined manually with ImageJ ( https : / / imagej . nih . gov / ) using confocal images showing X – Z sections of cell colonies stained for N - cadherin . Normalized nucleus dimension was further calculated as the ratio of the height to the width of a circumscribed rectangle bounding the nucleus . Projected cell areas were quantified with the CellProfiler program in ImageJ using immunofluorescence images showing ZO - 1 staining . Briefly , nuclei stained by DAPI were used for identification of each cell as primary objects in CellProfiler . ZO - 1 staining images were first filtered to remove background before being segregated using a propagation method to determine cell area . To determine projected cell area for central and peripheral zones of cell colonies , a binary circular mask with a diameter of half of the actual pattern diameter was used to crop the original cell colony images . Cells falling on the mask boundary were excluded from quantification . Immunofluorescence images showing p - SMAD 1 / 5 staining were analysed manually using ImageJ . Cells with nuclear p - SMAD 1 / 5 were identified as those showing dominant nuclear fluorescence and absence of cytoplasmic fluorescence . Conversely , cells with cytoplasmic p - SMAD 1 / 5 were identified as those showing absence of nuclear fluorescence . To quantify the spatial distribution of BMP - SMAD activation , circular colonies were divided into four concentric zones with equal widths . The percentage of cells with nuclear p - SMAD 1 / 5 in each zone was then calculated and plotted against the distance from colony centroid . Tracking cell migration and unbiased random walk model . On day 0 before cell seeding , hPS cells were labelled with CellTracker Red CMTPX Dye ( ThermoFisher Scientific ) for 30 min . Labelled hPS cells were mixed with unlabelled cells at a ratio of 1 : 7 before the cell mixture was seeded onto coverslips containing micropatterned circular adhesive islands . From day 2 ( t = 0 h ) to day 4 , live cell imaging was conducted using the Zeiss Axio Observer Z1 inverted epifluorescence microscope enclosed in the XL S1 incubator ( Carl Zeiss MicroImaging ) to maintain cell culture at 37 °C and 5 % CO 2 . Both bright field and fluorescence images were recorded every 20 min for a total of 41 h . All time - lapse images were reconstructed © 2018 Macmillan Publishers Limited , part of Springer Nature .

NAtuRe MAteRIALS | www . nature . com / naturematerials Articles NATure MATerIAlS using Image - Pro Plus ( http : / / www . mediacy . com / imageproplus ) to generate TIFF stacks for cell migration tracking . For each image , peripheries of each individual CellTracker labelled cells were marked manually . Positions of cell centroids were then identified from each image to calculate end - to - end cell displacement D and radial displacement during cell migration as a function of time . For radial displacement calculations , cells were divided into two groups based on their radial positions relative to the colony centroid at t = 0 h ( R 0 ) ( ‘central’ 0 ≤ R 0 ≤ 100 μ m ; ‘peripheral’ 100 < R 0 ≤ 200 μ m ) . If labelled hPS cells divided during cell migration tracking , one of the daughter cells was randomly selected to continue tracking . An unbiased random walk model was used for modelling cell migration during emergent neuroectoderm patterning in micropatterned circular hPS cell colonies . In this model , cells move randomly without any preferred migration direction . Cell centroids at each time step n ( denoted here as D n ) can be calculated as γ = + − AV D D n n 1 , where A is a random variable following a uniform distribution on [ 0 , 1 ] and γ is a random unit direction vector . Parameter V denotes the maximum cell centroid displacement during each time step , and it can be obtained through least - squares fitting of the experimental data of mean square end - to - end cell displacement D 2 using the expression = ∕ D V t 4 2 2 . Cell viability and proliferation assays . Cell viability was determined using the Live / Dead , Viability / Cytotoxicity Kit ( ThermoFisher Scientific ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . On day 4 and day 8 , culture medium was replaced with fresh medium containing ethidium homodimer ( EthD - 1 ; 4 µ M ) . After incubation for 30 min , fluorescence images were recorded using the Zeiss Axio Observer Z1 inverted epifluorescence microscope to quantify the number of dead cells in each colony . The Click - iT EdU Alexa Fluor 488 Imaging Kit ( ThermoFisher Scientific ) was used to measure cell proliferation according to the manufacturers’ instructions . Briefly , on day 3 , half of the culture medium was replaced with fresh medium containing EdU ( 20 µ M ) . Cells were incubated for 2 h before being fixed , permeabilized and incubated with the Click - iT reaction cocktail for 30 min . Cell nuclei were counterstained with DAPI . Cells were then examined under fluorescence microscopy ( Zeiss Axio Observer Z1 ) to detect EdU - stained cell nuclei . Traction force measurement . Traction force was analysed using PDMS micropost arrays ( PMAs ) as described previously 30 . Briefly , PMAs were first prepared for cell attachment using microcontact printing to coat micropost top surfaces with vitronectin . To quantify the traction forces of micropatterned cell colonies or single cells , microcontact printing was used to define circular adhesive patterns of different sizes . PMAs were labelled with Δ 9 - DiI ( 5 μ g ml − 1 ; Invitrogen ) for 1 h . Protein adsorption to all PDMS surfaces not coated with vitronectin was prevented by incubating in 0 . 2 % Pluronics F127 NF solution ( BASF ) for 30 min . Live cell imaging was conducted using the Zeiss Axio Observer Z1 inverted epifluorescence microscope enclosed in the XL S1 incubator . Images of micropost tops were recorded using a 40 × ( for single cells ) or 20 × ( for colonies ) objective ( Carl Zeiss MicroImaging ) . All images were recorded at day 4 and were analysed using a custom - developed MATLAB program ( MathWorks ) , as described previously 48 , to obtain traction force maps . To determine average traction stress maps for micropatterned cell colonies , individual traction force maps were first adjusted to the same size before being stacked together to obtain average traction stress maps . To plot average traction stress as a function of distance from the colony centroid , circular colonies were first divided into 20 concentric zones with equal widths . The average traction stress in each concentric zone was then calculated and plotted against the mean distance of the concentric zone from the colony centroid . Microfluidic cell stretching device . The microfluidic cell stretching device comprised a PDMS structural layer , a PDMS inlet block and a glass coverslip . The PDMS structural layer , which contained a microfluidic network for applying pressures to simultaneously activate 64 pressurization compartments to induce PDMS membrane deformation , was fabricated using soft lithography . Briefly , the PDMS prepolymer was spin - coated onto a silicon mould generated using photolithography and DRIE . The PDMS layer was thermally cured at 110 °C for at least 24 h before being peeled off the silicon mould . An inlet for fluid connections was then punched into the PDMS structural layer using a 1 mm biopsy punch ( Fisher Scientific ) . Both the coverslip and the PDMS structural layer were briefly cleaned with 100 % ethanol ( Fisher Scientific ) and blown dry under nitrogen before being treated with air plasma ( Plasma Prep II ; SPI Supplies ) and bonding together . In parallel , another PDMS block was prepared , and an inlet for fluid connection was punched into the PDMS block with a 0 . 5 mm biopsy punch . After treating both with air plasma , the PDMS block and the PDMS structural layer were bonded together with their fluid inlets aligned manually . The microfluidic cell stretching device was baked at 110 °C for at least another 24 h to ensure robust bonding between different layers . Deionized water was injected into the microfluidic cell stretching device before applying pressure through a microfluidic pressure pump ( AF1 , Elveflow ) . Elveflow Smart Interface software ( https : / / www . elveflow . com / ) was used for programming the pressure pump for continuous cell stretching with a square - wave pattern ( pulse width of 2 h , period of 4 h and 50 % duty cycle ) . RNA isolation and qRT - PCR analysis . As described previously 26 , RNA was extracted from cells using the RNeasy kit ( Qiagen ) following the manufacturer’s instructions . A CFX Connect SYBR Green PCR Master Mix system ( Bio - Rad ) was used for qRT - PCR . For relative quantification , human TBP primer was used as an endogenous control . An arbitrary Ct value of 40 was assigned to samples in which no expression was detected . Relative expression levels were determined by calculating 2 −∆∆ Ct with the corresponding s . e . m . All analyses were performed with at least three biological replicates and three technical replicates . Western blotting . As described previously 26 , whole cell lysates were prepared and separated on SDS - polyacrylamide gel before being transferred to PVDF membranes . PVDF membranes were then incubated with blocking buffer ( Li - Cor ) for 1 h before being soaked with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C . Blots were then incubated with IRDye secondary antibodies ( Li - Cor ) for 1 h . An Odyssey Sa Infrared Imaging System ( Li - Cor ) was used for protein expression detection . Uncropped scans of Western blots are shown in Supplementary Fig . 2 . siRNA knockdown . As described previously 26 , hPS cells were transfected with BMP4 or NOGGIN siRNA and scramble control using Viromer Blue ( OriGene ) . Briefly , cells were plated at 80 % confluence on vitronectin - coated 6 - well plates and subjected to siRNA transfection the next day . After 24 h , transfected cells were seeded onto coverslips containing micropatterned circular adhesive islands . Three additional siRNA treatments were conducted at days 2 , 4 and 6 after cell seeding . Pharmacological treatment . To inhibit actomyosin contractility , blebbistatin ( 10 µ M in DMSO ; Cayman Chemical ) was added to culture medium from day 1 till cell fixation . To modulate BMP signalling , recombinant human BMP4 ( 25 ng ml − 1 ; R & D Systems ) was added to the neural induction medium . Statistics . Statistical analysis was performed using Excel ( Microsoft ; https : / / www . microsoft . com ) . The statistical significance between two groups was analysed by a two - sided Student ' s t - test . In all cases , a P value of less than 0 . 05 was considered statistically significant . Reporting Summary .

Sample size Describe how sample size was determined . All experiments were conducted with at least two independent experiments and multiple biological replicates . Sample sizes were determined based on our previous experience and similar studies of other groups . Sample sizes were determined as sufficient since they led to similar results . 2 . Data exclusions Describe any data exclusions . Due to intrinsic inhomogeneous cell seeding , some multilayered cellular structures would inevitably appear in micropatterned cell colonies . These multilayered colonies were excluded from data analyses . When quantifying cell morphological features and nuclear staining as a function of different regions of micropatterned cell colonies , those cells falling on region boundaries were excluded from quantification . This information is explained in the " Image analysis " section of the Methods . 3 . Replication Describe the measures taken to verify the reproducibility of the experimental findings . Reported results were repeated and confirmed for at least two independent experiments . Key experimental findings were reliably reproduced by two investigators involved in this work . 4 .
