The challenges of doing paediatric research during the first year of the covid - 19 pandemic Danilo Buonsenso , 1 , 3 Damian Roland , 4 , 5 Adriana Yock - Corrales , 6 Sebastián González - Dambrauskas , 7 , 8 Petter Brodin , 9 Begona Santiago - Garcia , 10 Antoni Soriano - Arandes , 11 Marianne Koenraads , 12 Daniele De Luca , 13 Elizabeth Whittaker 14 , 15 At the beginning of 2020 , healthcare professionals were facing an unexpected surge in covid - 19 cases that put pressure on all healthcare systems , whose capacity was often exceeded . 1 For paediatricians , at least initially , SARS - CoV - 2 infection seemed more of an organisational problem than a clinical one . The available data from China about children with covid - 19 were reassuring—children were rarely infected , severecaseswereoccasional , andnodeaths were reported . In response , paediatricians from multiplesubspecialtiesquicklystarteddoingresearch withinanew , challengingenvironment . Existingand new regional research networks joined their efforts and created innovative global consortiums to investigate the spectrum of paediatric covid - 19 , spontaneously modelling a new paradigm of paediatricinternationalresearch . Theseauthorsshare their personal and scientific insights as clinicians , citizens , and researchers . Sebastián González - Dambrauskas ( Uruguay ) , says , “Scientific cooperation and research among paediatricintensivistsintheAmericasandacrosstheworldhasthrivedduringthepandemic . This was possiblebecausewehadalreadyestablishedthebasisforglobalcooperation , whichthenallowedmorethan 70 paediatric intensive care units from three continents to work together to analyse critical paediatric covid - 19 . 2 This network helped me to survive my own fears and uncertainties , channelling the bad feelings into something productive . ” Adriana Yock - Corrales ( Costa Rica ) , says , “I was activelyinvolvedinlargeLatinAmericanemergencydepartmentnetworks 3 and learnt the importance of resilience . Although we have been participating in manyresearchprojects , it’sbeendifficulttofindtime foreverything . Helpingmytwodaughterswithvirtual schooling throughout 2020 was a challenge , and I struggled to complete all the tasks that I had set for myself . Thispandemicbroughtouttheworstandthe best of people , and teamwork was essential . ” Europe was the first Western continent affected after China . Despiteinitialunpreparedness , theEuropean paediatric response has been substantial . A large European network , led by Begona Santiago ( Spain ) , provided paediatric covid - 19 data from the first multinational series . 4 Santiago says , “When the pandemic broke out , we experienced an unprecedented spirit of collaboration . SARS - CoV - 2 reached the case discussion forum of our paediatric tuberculosis research network , and we refocused on sharingexperiences , concerns , andadvice . Welearnt thestrengthandpotentialofdigitalcommunicationsfordoingqualityresearch , and learnt to understand each other better , even in the privacy of our homes—with the good and the bad that this entails . ” WhiletheUKwasbecomingoneoftheworstaffectedcountries , ElizabethWhittaker ( UK ) startedmanaging children with multisystem inflammatory syndrome temporally associated with SARS - CoV - 2 infection in children and was involved in one of the first formal descriptions . 5 She recalls , “After a year of the pandemic , I reflected on it all for the first time—and I was emotionally drained for 24 hours . It was so intense , supporting our colleagues in adult intensive care units and doing family liaison . I’m grateful not to have been personally touched by tragedy , but I have watched many colleagues deal with challenges—frompersonalbereavement , loneliness , anxiety about loved ones , anxiety about their personal lives , fertility , life chances , financial concerns , andsoon . ”Whittakerhashadtoreconsider all her research and clinical priorities , “my to - do list fromJanuary2020hauntsme , andI’mnotsurewhen I’llpickuptuberculosisandcytomegalovirusresearchagain . ” Understandingmultisysteminflammatorysyndromeinchildrenbecameapriority . PetterBrodin ( Sweden ) describedtheimmunologyofthesyndromein Nature Medicine . 6 “The past year has been incredibly intense , ” he says . However , successes didn’t come without pain , “I am mentally exhausted from all the misinformationandtheoftenunbearablediscussionsandattacks , even among colleagues . ” At the time , the effects of covid - 19 during pregnancy and childbirth were unknown and presented a challenge for the scientific community as well as parents worldwide . Daniele De Luca ( France ) was “preparing the entire staff in a few days , doing simulations , changing relevant protocols , always prioritising people’s protection , lending ventilators to adult intensive care units , creating two negative pressure isolating rooms within 48 hours . Then we confirmed transplacental transmission of the virus . 7 From the beginning I recommended being prudent and cautious . Only an open mind , prudence , attention , and close interdisciplinary collaboration make it possible to succeed . ” “Communication , teaching , and information were pivotalthroughouttheyear . Informationwasreleased incredibly fast , ” says Damian Roland ( UK ) . “One of the points I reflected on was the pace that everything is now working at . We seem to have had to step up a gear to make sure that all observations , findings , or results we produced were disseminated as soon as possibletokeepupwiththeinformationthatwasout 1 the bmj | BMJ 2022 ; 379 : o2750 | doi : 10 . 1136 / bmj . o2750 OPINION For numbered affiliations see end of article .

The start of 2021 was difficult as Roland had several research grant applications rejected . “In normal circumstances that would have been very difficult for me , but actually far more ‘real’ problems have emerged . My kids struggled with lockdown . While they did not need to access mental health input or services , it was hard—as it was for so many parents . Itmademethinkabouthowchallengingitmustbeforthosefamilieswhodon’thavealltheprivilegeswehave , especiallyforthoseliving in poverty or social isolation . I worked with colleagues who found thesituationtoughandchangedcareerplans , andwehadasudden and unexpected death of a paediatrician in our hospital . ” Nevertheless , “Lockdown made me appreciate family time more . I value walks with the family . I can imagine a slightly less hurried careerprogressionnow , whichisn’tdependentonjumpingasmany hoops as possible in a short space of time . ” The year 2020 probably had an impact on doctors’ personal and professional lives . “The transformation of healthcare services may have placed you in positions of leadership or responsibility , or perhaps opened your eyestoastalestatusquo , whichyouhavebeenimplicitlytolerating without really enjoying . ” 8 Antoni Soriano - Arandes found the energy to coordinate research efforts among hundreds of healthcare professionals in Catalonia , Spain , better to understand the role of children in SARS - CoV - 2 transmission . 9 “Childrenweresilenced , stigmatised , andneglected by politicians and those responsible for health policies , because they were suspected of being one of the drivers of this terrible pandemic . ” 10 When Danilo Buonsenso ( Italy ) saw his first patient in February 2020 , he was lucky to have access to a pocket ultrasound probe , which allowed him to publish what was probably the first detailed ultrasound description of covid - 19 pneumonia . 11 This led to satisfying professional relationships with colleagues from Europe , Africa , Latin America , and Australia , but it also had an indirect , negative impact on family relationships . Buonsenso’s partner—an infectious diseases specialist—was fully occupied in covid - 19 units and“alongsidetheinitialfearsofinfectingmyson , forme2020was definitely hard , lonely , and stressful . ” Although the discipline of covid - 19 research projects was important and helped him move forward , he wonders if “a string of publications and a couple of radio interviews count as success . ” A nuanced analysis of the year would help us to reflect on the choices and sacrifices we made . Public opinion and policy makers mustbemadeawareofthesacrifices , disappointments , frustrations , challenges , suffering , and renunciations experienced by those healthcare professionals who try to include research as their standard of care while taking care of patients—even during a pandemic . Policy makers need to ensure academic freedom and respect , by avoiding erosions in civility and achieving gender and race equality in the research and healthcare environment . Every crisis is an opportunity .
