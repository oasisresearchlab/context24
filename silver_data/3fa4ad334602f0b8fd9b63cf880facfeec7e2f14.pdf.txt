Both phosphoinositides and small GTP - binding proteins of the Rho family have been postu - lated to regulate actin assembly in cells . We have recon - stituted actin assembly in response to these signals in Xenopus extracts and examined the relationship of these pathways . We have found that GTP (cid:103) S stimulates actin assembly in the presence of endogenous mem - brane vesicles in low speed extracts . These membrane vesicles are required , but can be replaced by lipid vesi - cles prepared from purified phospholipids containing phosphoinositides . Vesicles containing phosphatidyl - inositol ( 4 , 5 ) bisphosphate or phosphatidylinositol ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) trisphosphate can induce actin assembly even in the absence of GTP (cid:103) S . RhoGDI , a guanine - nucleotide dissociation inhibitor for the Rho family , inhibits phos - phoinositide - induced actin assembly , suggesting the in - volvement of the Rho family small G proteins . Using various dominant mutants of these G proteins , we dem - onstrate the requirement of Cdc42 for phosphoinosi - tide - induced actin assembly . Our results suggest that phosphoinositides may act to facilitate GTP exchange on Cdc42 , as well as to anchor Cdc42 and actin nucle - ation activities . Hence , both phosphoinositides and Cdc42 are required to induce actin assembly in this cell - free system . T he actin cytoskeleton is involved in most aspects of cellular morphogenesis where it is dynamically reg - ulated by both extra - and intracellular signals ( Stos - sel , 1993 ; Fishkind and Wang , 1995 ; Mitchison and Cramer , 1996 ) . In almost all cases , this regulation is posttransla - tional and the locus of this posttranslational control is not on actin , but rather on actin binding proteins that control actin dynamics in the cell . There are (cid:122) 50 actin binding proteins identified so far that directly interact with actin and modulate its assembly properties ( Kreis and Vale , 1993 ) . They can be grouped into six functional families : monomer sequestering , filament severing , capping , nucle - ating , cross - linking , and bundling . The presence of such a large number of regulatory proteins makes it very difficult to study the physiological mechanisms controlling actin functions . Although it is relatively easy to identify the mechanism by which individual proteins act from in vitro studies , it is difficult to reveal the network of interactions that occur in vivo . It is even more challenging to connect the actin response to extracellular signals , which undoubt - edly involve a different assemblage of signaling factors . One very promising hint of in vivo control that has come from in vitro studies is the role of phosphoinositides , par - ticularly phosphatidylinositol ( 4 , 5 ) bisphosphate ( PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) , 1 as potential signaling intermediates ( Janmey , 1994 ) . PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 interacts with several actin binding proteins . For example , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binds profilin and dissociates actin from profilin / actin complex ( Lassing and Lindberg , 1985 ) ; it also inhib - its gelsolin functions , including severing , nucleation , and actin monomer binding ( Janmey and Stossel , 1989 ) . Stud - ies carried out in intact cells have also implicated phospho - inositides in signaling from activated cell surface receptors to intracellular actin cytoskeletal responses , making them attractive places to look for the linkage . The level of phos - phoinositide synthesis , for example , has been correlated with the amount of actin assembled in basophilic cells ( Apgar , 1995 ) and platelets ( Hartwig et al . , 1995 ) .

This document was created with FrameMaker 4 . 0 . 4 The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 140 , 1998 1126 phoinositide 3 - kinase ( PI 3 - kinase ) , a lipid kinase that phosphorylates the D - 3 position of phosphoinositides , is known to be required for PDGF - induced membrane ruf - fling and chemotaxis in fibroblasts ( Kundra et al . , 1994 ; Wennstrom et al . , 1994 ; Wymann and Arcaro , 1994 ; Nobes et al . , 1995 ) . Though lipid binding has been studied exten - sively in individual actin binding proteins , it is not clear which phosphoinositides are able to modulate actin assem - bly in cells . Only recently has the specificity been studied in permeabilized platelets ( Hartwig et al . , 1995 , 1996 ) . Another source of linkage between signal transduction pathways and actin assembly are the small GTP - binding proteins ( G proteins ) of the Rho family ( Machesky and Hall , 1996 ; Ridley , 1996 ; Zigmond , 1996 ) . This family , in - cluding Rac , Rho , and Cdc42 , are Ras - like small GTPases that act as molecular switches cycling from GTP - bound ac - tive forms to GDP - bound inactive forms ( Bourne et al . , 1991 ; Hall , 1992 ) . The GTP / GDP cycle is mainly con - trolled by GTPase - activating proteins , guanine - nucleotide exchange factors ( GEFs ) , and guanine - nucleotide dissoci - ation inhibitors ( GDIs ) ( Boguski and McCormick , 1993 ) . When injected into fibroblasts in a constitutively active form , each member of the Rho family elicits distinct mor - phological changes that involve remodeling of the actin cy - toskeleton ( Ridley and Hall , 1992 ; Ridley et al . , 1992 ; Nobes and Hall , 1995 ) . In yeast cells , Cdc42 is required for polarized cell growth and bud formation , two actin - depen - dent processes ( Chant , 1994 ) . Despite the central role pos - tulated for them , it is not clear how these small G proteins are activated or how they regulate actin assembly . Surpris - ingly , several target - binding domain mutants of these G proteins do not interfere with their ability to induce actin assembly ( Lamarche et al . , 1996 ; Tapon and Hall , 1997 ) . G proteins are usually activated by GEFs , but nothing is known about where this occurs . All GEFs for the Rho family are soluble proteins ( Cerione and Zheng , 1996 ) , but the function that G proteins execute is membrane associ - ated . It is not clear whether G proteins are activated in the cytosol before binding to the membrane or whether they are associated with the membrane first , and then activated there . Although both phosphoinositides and small G proteins seem to be involved in regulating the actin cytoskeleton , it is not clear whether these two signaling pathways are re - lated to each other . Several studies have suggested a role of G proteins in lipid kinase activation . Phosphoinositide kinases are associated with activated G proteins in both cell lysates and tissue homogenates ( Tolias et al . , 1995 ) . A phosphatidylinositol 4 - phosphate 5 - kinase is associated with Rho in Swiss 3T3 cells ( Ren et al . , 1996 ) . Activation of PI 3 - kinase requires Rho in platelets ( Zhang et al . , 1993 ) . However , additional evidence suggests that lipid ki - nases may be involved in controlling G proteins . In fibro - blast cells , PI 3 - kinase is required for PDGF - stimulated Rac activation ( Hawkins et al . , 1995 ) and constitutively ac - tive PI 3 - kinase is able to activate Rac / Rho ( Reif et al . , 1996 ) . In addition , activation of small G proteins appears to correlate with the increase in phosphoinositide synthe - sis . The level of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is increased in response to the activation of Rho in Swiss 3T3 cells ( Chong et al . , 1994 ) and Rac in platelets ( Hartwig et al . , 1995 ) . These mixed re - sults make it difficult to draw conclusive lines among the two signaling molecules and the actin cytoskeleton . Xenopus egg extracts have proven to be a powerful cell - free system for reconstituting heterogeneous and complex reactions including nuclear assembly and disassembly ( Newport and Spann , 1987 ) , chromosome condensation ( Ohsumi et al . , 1993 ) , spindle assembly ( Sawin et al . , 1992 ) , DNA replication ( Hutchison et al . , 1989 ) , and the control of cell cycle ( Murray and Kirschner , 1989 ) . Re - cently , the actin - based motility of Listeria has also been re - constituted in egg extracts ( Theriot et al . , 1994 ; Marchand et al . , 1995 ) , suggesting that the extracts contain all the necessary components in somatic cells that are required to modulate actin assembly . However , egg extracts have not been used to reconstitute the interplay of membrane - based actin assembly with soluble components . It should be pos - sible to reconstitute membrane - dependent cytoskeletal re - sponses by including endogenous membranes or providing exogenous membranes to the extracts . We report on the success of that approach here and its use in unraveling as - pects of the physiological control of actin polymerization . Materials and Methods Preparation of Extracts Low speed mitotic extracts from unfertilized eggs were prepared from Xe - nopus eggs in a buffer ( XB ) containing 10 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 7 , 100 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 , 5 mM EGTA , 50 mM sucrose , 1 mM DTT , and protease inhibitors as described ( Murray , 1991 ) , except that cy - tochalasin was omitted in all steps . Extracts were either used immediately or supplemented with 200 mM sucrose and frozen in liquid nitrogen . High speed supernatants were prepared from low speed extracts ac - cording to King et al . ( 1995 ) . Briefly , low speed extracts were diluted 10 - fold in XB and then centrifuged at 400 , 000 g for 1 h . The clear supernatant was carefully removed and reconcentrated to its original volume in Cen - triprep - 3 or - 10 concentrators ( Amicon Corp . , Danvers , MA ) , giving a fi - nal concentration of 40 – 50 mg / ml . The membrane pellet was resuspended in XB to the same original volume and broken up in a Dounce homoge - nizer . All extract fractions were supplemented with energy regenerating mix containing 1 mM ATP , 1 . 25 mM MgCl 2 , 7 . 5 mM creatine phosphate , and 0 . 1 mM EGTA , and stored at (cid:50) 80 (cid:56) C . Actin concentration is (cid:122) 2 mg / ml in low speed extracts and 1 mg / ml in high speed supernatants as esti - mated by Western blot . Preparation of Lipid Vesicles All phospholipids were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co . ( St . Louis , MO ) or Avanti Polar Lipids ( Alabaster , AL ) , except PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 and PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 , which were gifts from Dr . Ching - Shih Chen ( University of Kentucky , Lexington , KY ) . Lipids were dissolved in chloroform and stored at (cid:50) 80 (cid:56) C . Lipid vesicles were prepared as follows . Equal amounts of phosphatidylcholine ( PC ) and phosphatidylinositol ( PI ) were mixed with or without each phosphoinositide in chloroform and dried in air . The dried lipid mixture was resuspended in a lipid buffer ( 20 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 7 , 1 mM EDTA ) to a final concentration of 1 mM . The mixture was then sonicated in a water bath with a W - 385 ultrasonic processor ( Heat Sys - tems Inc . , Farmingdale , NY ) at its maximum power ( 475 Watts ) for 5 min . Video Microscopy and Image Analysis Extract samples were viewed with a 63 (cid:51) / 1 . 4 NA plan - apochromatic ob - jective on a Zeiss Axiovert 135 microscope ( Carl Zeiss , Inc . , Thornwood , NY ) . A multi - band pass dichroic and emission filter set ( Chroma Technol - ogy Co . , Brattleboro , VT ) was used for fluorescence observation and a dual filter wheel ( Ludl , Hawthorne , NY ) was used to choose appropriate excitation and neutral density filters . All images were collected with a cooled charge coupled device ( CCD ; Photometrics Inc . , Tucson , AZ ) and stored digitally on a hard disk . Device control , image acquisition , and data analysis were carried out using Metamorph 2 . 0 ( Universal Imaging Corp . , West Chester , PA ) software running on an IBM - compatible computer . To look for the relative position of lipid vesicles , the nitrobenzoxadiazole im - Ma et al . Actin Assembly in Xenopus Egg Extracts 1127 age was taken immediately after the rhodamine image with a time delay estimated at (cid:122) 1 s . The two images were then pseudocolored and overlaid . Visual Assay for Actin Polymerization All reactions were carried out at room temperature . For experiments us - ing low speed extracts , 1 (cid:109) l rhodamine actin ( 0 . 2 – 0 . 4 mg / ml ) was mixed with 6 - (cid:109) l extracts ( either concentrated or diluted twofold with XB ) . Rhodamine actin was prepared according to Symons and Mitchison ( 1991 ) using purified rabbit skeletal muscle actin and tetramethyl - rhodamine - iodoacetamide rhodamine ( Molecular Probes , Inc . , Eugene , OR ) . After the addition of either GTP (cid:103) S or vanadate ( 1 (cid:109) l ) to the extract to a final concentration of 1 mM , 5 (cid:109) l of the reaction mixture was squashed between two coverslips . The coverslips were then mounted on the microscope stage for imaging as described above . For experiments us - ing phosphoinositides , 3 (cid:109) l high speed supernatants were diluted with 3 (cid:109) l XB and supplemented with 1 (cid:109) l rhodamine actin . 1 (cid:109) l lipid vesicles ( 1 mM ) were then added . Pyrene Actin Assay Pyrene actin was labeled according to an established protocol ( Kouyama and Mihashi , 1981 ) using rabbit skeletal muscle actin and N - ( 1 - pyrene ) io - doacetamide ( Molecular Probes , Inc . ) . Due to the high background fluo - rescence in the extracts , high speed supernatants were diluted three - to fourfold in XB to a final concentration of (cid:122) 10 mg / ml . 3 – 5 min after 100 (cid:109) l diluted high speed supernatants were mixed with pyrene actin in a quartz cuvette , 5 - (cid:109) l lipid vesicles ( 1 mM ) were added . Pyrene fluorescence was measured at 407 nm with excitation at 365 nm in a Aminco - Bowman Se - ries 2 Luminescence Spectrometer ( SLM - Aminco Inc . , Rochester , NY ) with 4 - nm slit width . Kinetics of the reaction was analyzed and plotted in Origin ( Microcal Software , Inc . , Northampton , MA ) . Purification of Recombinant Proteins Small G proteins were expressed in COS cells as glutathione - S - transferase ( GST ) fusion proteins . COS cells were transfected using the calcium phos - phate method and allowed at least 60 h to express fusion proteins . Protein purification followed ( Heyworth et al . , 1993 ) with some modifications . Briefly , cells were broken by sonication in a buffer with 10 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 3 , 100 mM KCl , 3 mM NaCl , 3 . 5 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 1 mM DTT , and protease inhibitors . Nuclei and cell debris were then removed by centrifugation at 10 , 000 g (cid:63) min . The supernatant was then centrifuged at 200 , 000 g (cid:63) h to pellet the membrane . Except for Cdc42V12C189S , the membrane for all other G proteins was solubilized in an extraction buffer ( 25 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 7 , 50 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM DTT , 1 % cholate , and protease inhibitors ) . After a clarifying spin at 200 , 000 g (cid:63) h , the supernatant was then incubated with glutathione - Sepharose beads ( Pharmacia Biotech , Piscataway , NJ ) at 4 (cid:56) C overnight . After wash , the beads were then eluted with an elution buffer ( 50 mM Tris , pH 8 . 0 , 150 mM NaCl , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 2 . 5 mM CaCl 2 , 5 mM DTT , 0 . 1 % cholate , and 10 mM reduced glutathione ) . Eluted proteins were cleaved with thrombin and analyzed by SDS - PAGE . Cdc42V12C189S was precipitated using glutathione beads directly from the supernatant after centrifugation at 200 , 000 g (cid:63) h . RhoGDI was expressed in Escherichia coli as a GST fusion protein and was purified using glutathione beads . To activate them with GTP (cid:103) S , processed G proteins were incubated with 20 mM EDTA and 40 (cid:109) M GTP (cid:103) S for 15 min at 30 (cid:56) C . GTP (cid:103) S was then locked in place by adding 20 mM extra MgCl 2 . Results GTP (cid:103) S and Sodium Orthovanadate Each Induce Localized Actin Polymerization and Vesicle Motility in Low Speed Egg Extracts As agonists in several signaling systems , GTP (cid:103) S and so - dium orthovanadate were added to low speed extracts ( 4 , 000 g (cid:63) h ) of Xenopus eggs in an attempt to induce actin assembly . To visualize actin , we used a rhodamine actin - based visual assay , which had been used to study Listeria - induced actin assembly in extracts ( Theriot et al . , 1994 ; Marchand et al . , 1995 ) . In this assay , a trace amount of rhodamine actin was added to mark the behavior of en - dogenous actin . Despite the presence of a large number of heterogeneous endogenous vesicles in low speed extracts , the fluorescence of rhodamine actin was uniform across the field , signifying no apparent assembly ( Fig . 1 A ) . Lo - calized foci of actin assembly could be induced by adding 1 mM GTP (cid:103) S or sodium orthovanadate to the extracts . Approximately 5 min after the addition of either com - pound , bright fluorescent foci appeared , some in the shape of comet tails ( Fig . 1 ) . Actin assembly occurred only around a subset of the phase - dense vesicles , which were propelled through the cytoplasm along gently curved tra - jectories ( Fig . 1 E ) . The average velocity was 10 . 0 (cid:109) m / min ( SEM (cid:53) 1 . 3 ; measured from the vanadate experiments ) , similar to that observed with Listeria ( Theriot et al . , 1994 ; Marchand et al . , 1995 ) . Cytochalasin D ( 20 (cid:109) M ) com - pletely inhibited the formation of foci and comet tails , in - dicating that motility and assembly reflected the accumu - lation of polymerized actin ( data not shown ) . Comet tails appeared as phase - dense structures under the phase contrast microscope . These comet tails often had distinct vesicles at one end . When the tails were large ( up to 4 (cid:109) m in width ) , rhodamine fluorescence clearly de - lineated the contour of associated vesicles ( Fig . 1 E ) . While many phase - dense vesicles showed no association with actin , the majority of comet tails were associated with visible vesicles of variable sizes . Only when the tails were small was it difficult to find any vesicles at their ends . Af - ter the phase - dense vesicles were removed from extracts by sedimentation at 400 , 000 g (cid:63) h , the remaining high speed supernatants did not induce actin assembly in the presence of GTP (cid:103) S or vanadate . When the vesicle fraction was added back , actin foci and comet tails reformed ( data not shown ) . The intimate physical association of these phase dense vesicles with foci and comet tails suggests that actin assembly is nucleated from the vesicles . Lipid Vesicles Containing Purified Phosphoinositides Can Induce Localized Actin Polymerization in Vesicle - free Extracts Membrane vesicles seem indispensable for actin polymer - ization in this system since GTP (cid:103) S is unable to induce ac - tin assembly in high speed supernatants lacking endoge - nous vesicles . Though it is possible that these membrane vesicles simply provide a hydrophobic docking surface for activated G proteins , some specific constituents of the membrane , such as modified phospholipids or membrane - associated proteins , might be required for the induction of actin assembly . To examine the role of specific phospho - lipids in regulating actin assembly , we prepared synthetic lipid vesicles from purified phospholipids and tested their ability to induce actin assembly in vesicle - free supernatants . Lipid vesicles of diameter estimated to be (cid:44) 200 nm ( Janmey and Stossel , 1989 ) were constructed from PC and PI . When added to high speed supernatants containing la - beled actin , they did not induce localized actin assembly ( Fig . 2 A ) . However , inclusion of 33 % phosphatidylinosi - tol ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) trisphosphate ( PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ) in PC / PI vesicles stimulated the formation of actin foci and comet tails ( Fig . 2 B ) . In a typical field of 10 , 000 (cid:109) m 2 , there were (cid:122) 41 . 2 (cid:54) 10 foci and 4 . 0 (cid:54) 0 . 5 comet tails with an average length of The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 140 , 1998 1128 4 . 3 (cid:54) 0 . 2 (cid:109) m . These comet tails moved at a rate of 5 . 4 (cid:109) m / min ( SEM (cid:53) 1 . 1 ) ( Fig . 2 G ) . PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 - containing lipid vesicles themselves could be visualized by including in them nitrobenzoxadiazole ( NBD ) - tagged PC ( 4 % ) . The vast majority of rhodamine signals were associated with the tagged vesicles ( data not shown ) . Strikingly , each comet tail had only one NBD - vesicle attached to its end ( Fig . 2 H ) . All assembly could be blocked completely by cytochalasin D . The induction of actin foci was dependent on the type of phosphoinositide used . Vesicles containing PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 pro - duced both foci ( 19 . 7 (cid:54) 4 . 4 ) and comet tails ( 1 . 5 (cid:54) 0 . 6 ) ( Fig . 2 C ) as did vesicles containing PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 . However , vesicles containing phosphatidylinositol ( 3 , 4 ) bisphos - phate or phosphatidylinositol ( 3 ) phosphate ( PI ( 3 ) P ) pro - duced fewer foci ( 6 . 5 (cid:54) 0 . 8 or 9 . 5 (cid:54) 0 . 7 per 10 , 000 (cid:109) m 2 field ) and no comet tails ( Fig . 2 , D and F ) . Vesicles con - taining phosphatidylinositol ( 4 ) phosphate ( PI ( 4 ) P ) in - duced foci ( 35 . 9 (cid:54) 7 . 5 per field ) but fewer tails ( 1 . 2 (cid:54) 0 . 6 per field ) ( Fig . 2 E ) . Quantitative Pyrene Actin Assays for Assembly Induced by Phosphoinositides Although the visual assay gave a reproducible qualitative picture of the effectiveness of different phosphoinositides , it was not readily quantifiable . Vesicles varied in size , as did the amount of actin associated with them and there was no simple measure of the volume in the field to be used for comparison . To give a more accurate measure - ment of the polymerized actin , we used a well - established pyrene actin assay ( Cooper et al . , 1983 ) . Pyrene actin has increased fluorescence when it is incorporated into fila - mentous actin ( F - actin ) . Therefore , an increase in fluores - cence intensity is a direct measure of actin polymerization and the kinetics can be easily monitored in a spectrofluorometer . Figure 1 .

The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 140 , 1998 1130 Like purified actin , pyrene actin assembles spontane - ously into filaments in high salt buffers , with a lag phase followed by a nearly linear increase ( Cooper et al . , 1983 ) . After the addition of 1 (cid:109) M pyrene actin to high speed su - pernatants containing physiological salts , there was no ap - preciable increase in fluorescence for at least 1 h ( data not shown ) . The magnitude of pyrene signal in the superna - tant did not differ much from that in a low salt buffer , indi - cating that most of the actin in the extract remained unpo - lymerized . Under the condition used in the experiments , nearly 90 % of the basal fluorescence signal came from the extracts diluted to 10 mg / ml , and 10 % was due to pyrene actin ( 1 (cid:109) M final concentration ) . Kinetics of Actin Assembly Induced by Phosphoinositides . When vesicles containing only PC / PI were added to high speed supernatants , the pyrene signal again remained un - changed after an immediate 5 – 10 % increase due to the light scattering of the lipids ( Fig . 3 A ) . However , the addi - tion of vesicles containing only 4 % PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 or PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 to the supernatant caused a rapid increase in fluorescence ( Fig . 3 A ) during the first 3 – 5 min . Within 5 – 10 min , the fluorescence was at 10 (cid:51) the original signal . At the peak , we estimated that (cid:122) 10 % of total actin in the extract had been incorporated into F - actin , after normalizing to the fluorescence intensity from extracts treated with 2 . 5 (cid:109) M phalloidin . The kinetics and the magnitude of the response were similar for both phosphoinositides . The increase in pyrene signal could be completely inhibited by 5 (cid:109) M cy - tochalasin D ( Fig . 3 C ) . The role of these specific phosphoinositides to induce actin assembly was confirmed by incubation of extracts with a lipid - binding peptide ( QRLFQVKGRR ) derived from gelsolin . This peptide has been shown to bind phos - phoinositides and can compete for phosphoinositide - bind - ing with gelsolin ( Janmey et al . , 1992 ) . The peptide com - pletely inhibited actin assembly induced by PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 at 20 (cid:109) M with a half inhibitory concentration of 5 – 10 (cid:109) M ( Fig . 3 C ) , consistent with its estimated micromolar affin - ity with PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 micelles ( Janmey et al . , 1992 ) . Specificity of Phosphoinositides in Actin Assembly . Vesicles containing three other phosphoinositides , 4 % PI ( 3 , 4 , ) P 2 , ( an isomer of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) , 4 % PI ( 4 ) P , or 4 % PI ( 3 ) P induced actin assembly at very slow rates and to a much lower extent when compared with PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( Fig . 3 B ) . The rate of actin assembly for PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 was only 5 % that for PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ; the total amount of F - actin after 5 min was 29 % that of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . These results are consistent with those from the visual assay . Dose Response of Actin Assembly to Phosphoinositides . To ascertain whether the effective levels of phosphoinositides in vesicles were physiologically meaningful , we varied the phosphoinositide concentration in the vesicles and com - pared the initial rate of actin polymerization and the total amount of F - actin at the peak . Fig . 3 D , a , shows the dose response to PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 at a total lipid con - centration of 50 (cid:109) M . Vesicles containing only 1 % of PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 or 1 % PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 gave measurable stimulation of assembly . The extent of assembly increased with the percentage of phosphoinositides in lipid vesicles to a maxi - mum at 12 % for PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 and 4 % for PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . Above 4 % , the activity induced by PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 plateaued . Interest - ingly , a higher concentration of PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ( 33 % ) reduced the activity to about one third of that at 12 % . These results suggested that there might be a limiting component in the extract , depleted above 12 % PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 or 4 % PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 at 50 mM total lipids . We therefore varied the concentration of total lipids , holding the phospho - Figure 3 .

All activities are normalized to that of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . ( C ) Inhibition of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - induced actin assembly in high speed supernatants by cytochalasin D or a peptide ( QRLFQVKGRR ) derived from gelsolin . Each reaction included 50 - (cid:109) M lipid vesicles containing 4 % PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . Inhibition of PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 - induced activity is similar and is not shown here . ( D ) Dose response of actin assembly to phosphoinositides .

( b ) F - actin induced by vesicles containing 4 % PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in high speed supernatants at various total lipid concentrations ( expressed as total PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) . The data fit into a linear curve ( dashed line ) . The initial rate has very similar dose – response profiles ( not shown ) . All activities are normalized to that of phosphoinositides at 4 % in 50 (cid:109) M total lipids . All data in B – D are expressed as mean (cid:54) SEM calculated from at least two sets of normalized data . Ma et al . Actin Assembly in Xenopus Egg Extracts 1131 inositide composition at 4 % . F - actin increased linearly with increasing total lipids , from 3 . 8 % of the total actin in the extract at 20 (cid:109) M total lipids to 15 . 8 % at 100 (cid:109) M lipids ( Fig . 3 D , b ) . The initial rate also increased linearly ( data not shown ) . This argues against a shortage of cytoplasmic factors and suggests that the plateau of effects at 12 % or more PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 or PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 reflects limits on each vesicle . GTP (cid:103) S Broadens the Specificity of Phosphoinositides for Actin Assembly The effect of GTP (cid:103) S in stimulating actin assembly off en - dogenous vesicles suggested that it might be able to over - come unfavorable lipid or protein composition . We there - fore retested the lipid specificity for actin assembly in the presence of GTP (cid:103) S . Although PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 - containing vesi - cles did not induce actin assembly in vesicle - free superna - tants , incubation with 100 (cid:109) M GTP (cid:103) S before the addition of PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 stimulated these vesicles to induce actin as - sembly . In this case , there was a noticeable lag of (cid:122) 100 s between the addition of lipids and the beginning of in - crease in fluorescence ( Fig . 4 ) . Actin assembly was sensi - tive to the GTP (cid:103) S concentration . Concentrations below 1 (cid:109) M GTP (cid:103) S had no stimulatory effect , but at 10 (cid:109) M GTP (cid:103) S , PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 was as effective as PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( Fig . 4 B ) . In control experiments , GTP (cid:103) S ( 100 (cid:109) M ) alone did not stimulate ac - tin assembly ( data not shown ) . The stimulation by GTP (cid:103) S was not limited to PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 - containing vesicles ( Fig . 4 B ) . Both the rate and amount of F - actin formation increased several fold in the presence of GTP (cid:103) S for vesicles containing PI ( 4 ) P or PI ( 3 ) P . For vesi - cles containing PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 or PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 , the rate was al - most doubled by 10 (cid:109) M GTP (cid:103) S , and the effect was depen - dent on the dose of GTP (cid:103) S ( Fig . 4 C ) . The effect of GTP (cid:103) S was specific for phosphoinositides , since there was very lit - tle stimulatory effect of GTP (cid:103) S on PC / PI vesicles ( Fig . 4 B ) . These results suggest that some but not all of the lipid specificity can be suppressed by GTP (cid:103) S . It is worth noting that GTP (cid:103) S , at concentrations (cid:46) 100 (cid:109) M , also induced a delayed fluorescence increase followed by a drop to almost the basal line ( Fig . 4 A , right ) . This was due to the aggregation of the added lipid vesicles because we no - ticed a visible lipid aggregate in the reaction mixture and the loss of NBD - PC signal after the spike appeared . We speculated that an actin - based contraction and / or gelation system was activated by a G protein at high GTP (cid:103) S doses . Involvement of the Rho Family Small G Proteins in Phosphoinositide - induced Actin Assembly GTP (cid:103) S is an agonist with a broad spectrum and can activate any GTP - binding proteins in the extracts . To determine whether the Rho family small G proteins were required for GTP (cid:103) S - induced actin assembly , we tested whether the activ - ity was sensitive to RhoGDI , a protein that binds prefer - entially to GDP - bound proteins and prevents nucleotide exchange ( Boguski and McCormick , 1993 ; Takai et al . , 1993 ) . To test whether RhoGDI could inhibit actin assembly from the endogenous vesicles stimulated by GTP (cid:103) S , re - combinant RhoGDI was purified from E . coli and incu - bated in high speed supernatants supplemented with en - dogenous vesicles before the addition of GTP (cid:103) S . Actin assembly was completely abolished in the presence of RhoGDI at concentrations between 0 . 5 and 2 . 5 (cid:109) M ( Fig . 5 A ) . Since RhoGDI interacts with all three members of the family ( Takai et al . , 1993 ) , we can only conclude that some or all G proteins of the Rho family are involved in GTP (cid:103) S - induced actin assembly in egg extracts . We further tested whether RhoGDI could block GTP (cid:103) S - stimulated actin assembly by a variety of phosphoinositides in high speed supernatants . RhoGDI ( 2 (cid:109) M ) abolished the ability of GTP (cid:103) S to stimulate PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 - induced actin assem - bly ( Fig . 5 B , a ) . The dose for half maximum inhibition by RhoGDI was between 80 and 400 nM ( Fig . 5 B , c ) . Surprisingly , RhoGDI inhibited not only the enhance - ment of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - dependent activity by GTP (cid:103) S , but the basal activity as well . Fig . 5 B , b shows that F - actin - induc - ing activity of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in the absence of GTP (cid:103) S was blocked by RhoGDI ( 2 (cid:109) M ) . The inhibition was depen - dent on the concentration of RhoGDI , with similar effec - tive doses for the GTP (cid:103) S - stimulated assembly of PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 vesicles ( Fig . 5 B , d ) . This result suggests that the Rho Figure 4 . Effects of GTP (cid:103) S on phosphoinositide - induced actin assembly in high speed supernatants . ( A ) Time course of actin as - sembly induced by lipid vesicles containing 25 % PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 or PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 followed by pyrene fluorescence . High speed superna - tants were treated with ( solid line ) or without ( dashed line ) 0 . 1 mM GTP (cid:103) S for 5 min , and then stimulated with lipid vesicles ( 50 (cid:109) M ) . ( B ) Comparison of the effect of GTP (cid:103) S on different lipid vesicles . Experiments were done as in A and lipid vesicles con - tained 25 % of each phosphoinositide .

Special Role of Cdc42 Cdc42 Is Required for PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - induced Actin Assembly . To characterize the small G proteins that were required for PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - induced activity , we first tested the dominant active forms of small G proteins of the Rho family and asked whether they could rescue RhoGDI inhibition . Dominant active Cdc42V12 was purified from COS cell membranes and added directly to the extracts without loading with GTP (cid:103) S . Fig . 6 A shows that Cdc42V12 re - stored F - actin , inducing activity of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in a dose - dependent manner . In the absence of GTP (cid:103) S , Cdc42V12 itself did not induce any actin assembly in the extracts . We further tested whether Cdc42 was necessary using Cdc - 42N17 , a dominant negative form . As shown in Fig . 6 B , 0 . 17 (cid:109) M Cdc42N17 blocked PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - induced actin as - sembly . In contrast , the dominant negative form RacN17 was not able to do so , even when present at a much higher concentration ( 1 . 67 (cid:109) M ) . These results suggest that Cdc42 may be both necessary and sufficient for PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - induced actin polymerization . Interestingly , Cdc42N17 only par - tially inhibited PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 - and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - induced actin as - sembly in the presence of GTP (cid:103) S ( Fig . 6 C ) . This suggests that GTP (cid:103) S may activate other small G proteins in this system . Under Special Conditions , Activated Cdc42 Can Induce Actin Assembly in Vesicle - free Extracts . To test whether Cdc42 alone could induce actin assembly , both dominant active Cdc42V12 and RacV12 were added to the extracts . Neither had an effect on actin assembly ( data not shown ) . We reasoned that there might not be sufficient exchange activities present in the extracts to activate the proteins with GTP . We then loaded Cdc42V12 and RacV12 with GTP (cid:103) S in the presence of EDTA before adding them to high speed supernatants . As shown in Fig . 7 A , GTP (cid:103) S - Cdc42 induced a significant amount of F - actin in a lipid - independent manner , with an assembly rate more than half of that induced by PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . In contrast , GTP (cid:103) S - RacV12 did not generate any noticeable amount of F - actin . The free GTP (cid:103) S carried over from the loading reaction was diluted to (cid:44) 4 (cid:109) M and did not have any effect on its own ( Fig . 7 A , Control ) . In the visual assay using rhodamine actin , vesicle - free extracts supplemented with GTP (cid:103) S - Cdc - 42V12 contained many rhodamine foci as well as tail struc - tures similar to those observed in the low speed extract ( Fig . 7 B ) . These structures were completely absent in GTP (cid:103) S - RacV12 - treated extracts . Actin assembly stimulated by activated Cdc42V12 requires prenylated proteins . Cdc - 42V12C189S , a CAAX box mutant devoid of prenylation , was unable to stimulate actin assembly even when charged with GTP (cid:103) S ( Fig . 7 A ) . Discussion Molecular and pharmacological studies in intact cells have suggested many signaling pathways that regulate the actin cytoskeleton under physiological conditions ( Machesky and Hall , 1996 ; Ridley , 1996 ; Zigmond , 1996 ) . Recently , permeabilized cells have also been used to study actin as - sembly ( Hartwig et al . , 1995 ; Tardif et al . , 1995 ; Barkalow et al . , 1996 ) . Due to the intimate association of actin assem - bly with the plasma membrane ( Symons and Mitchison , 1991 ) , it is difficult to use conventional biochemical ap - proaches , which have been developed to study the cyto - skeleton in soluble systems , to study membrane - depen - dent regulation of the actin cytoskeleton . In this report , we have demonstrated the use of Xenopus egg extracts to reconstitute membrane - dependent actin as - Figure 5 . Inhibition of actin assembly by RhoGDI .

Endogenous vesicles were stimu - lated with 100 (cid:109) M GTP (cid:103) S in extracts that were preincubated without ( a ) or with ( b ) 2 . 5 (cid:109) M recombinant RhoGDI for 5 min .

In a and c , high speed superna - tants were preincubated with 10 (cid:109) M GTP (cid:103) S and RhoGDI for 5 min . In b and d , GTP (cid:103) S was omitted .

Actin Assembly in Xenopus Egg Extracts 1133 sembly and to study both actin assembly and aspects of signal transduction . Endogenous membranes can be stim - ulated to nucleate actin assembly in the presence of GTP (cid:103) S or sodium orthovanadate . We have been able to define some of the important functional membrane components and distinguish them from the soluble factors contributing to actin assembly . We also demonstrate a key role for Cdc42 in mediating phosphoinositide - stimulated actin as - sembly in this cell - free system . Finally , as described below , we suggest a regulatory pathway involving phosphoinosi - tides in both the catalysis of guanine - nucleotide exchange ( directly or indirectly ) and the localization of activated small G proteins . We have shown that PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 are able to induce actin assembly in high speed supernatants . Since other phosphoinositide isoforms and phospholipids are in - effective , it cannot be simply charge that is important for PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 in regulating actin assembly . The specificity of phosphoinositides is likely to be universally applicable because high speed extracts contain a physio - logical mixture of well balanced actin binding proteins un - der which actin polymerization is globally inhibited but locally activatable . For this reason , we propose that PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 are important membrane signals for actin assembly in vivo . At present we are unable to de - termine whether the apparently equal effectiveness of PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in inducing actin assembly is due to the fact that one may be converted to another in the egg extract . Wortmannin , a potent PI 3 - kinase inhibitor ( Arcaro and Wymann , 1993 ) , does not interfere with PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - induced actin assembly and we have not seen phosphate incorporation into PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in the extracts ( data not shown ) . These data suggest that PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 itself is sufficient . How - ever , the presence of a wortmannin - insensitive PI 3 - kinase could not be ruled out , and the conversion of a small amount of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 into PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 would be hard to de - tect . On the other hand , PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 could be converted back to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 if a 3 - phosphatase were present . It is also possible that both phosphoinositides are equally potent in the extract . The levels of PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 needed to gener - ate actin assembly in egg extracts are surprisingly low . As little as 1 % will induce polymerization . The overall level of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 in cells is (cid:122) 0 . 4 % and (cid:44) 0 . 01 % , respectively ( Auger et al . , 1989 ) . Since it is likely that their Figure 6 . Involvement of Cdc42 in PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - induced actin as - sembly in high speed supernatants . ( A ) Cdc42V12 rescues the inhibition of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - induced actin assembly by RhoGDI . Cdc42V12 without GTP (cid:103) S was added to high speed supernatants along with RhoGDI ( 0 . 4 (cid:109) M ) . After a 5 - min incubation , vesicles containing 25 % PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 were added to a final concentration of 60 (cid:109) M . ( B ) Inhibition of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - induced actin assembly in high speed supernatants by the dominant negative form of Cdc42 , but not that of Rac .

( C ) Partial inhibi - tion of GTP (cid:103) S - stimulated actin assembly by Cdc42N17 in high speed supernatants . Extracts were incubated with or without 0 . 34 (cid:109) M Cdc42N17 for 5 min before the addition of 10 (cid:109) M GTP (cid:103) S and 60 (cid:109) M phosphoinositide - containing vesicles ( 12 % for PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and 25 % for PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 ) . In all experiments , actin assembly was monitored using pyrene actin and the activities were normalized to the controls . Figure 7 .

( A ) Time course of actin assembly in high speed supernatants incubated with 0 . 17 (cid:109) M Cdc42V12 - GTP (cid:103) S ( solid line ) , 0 . 83 (cid:109) M RacV12 - GTP (cid:103) S ( dashed line ) , buffer ( dotted line ) or 0 . 17 (cid:109) M Cdc42V12C189S - GTP (cid:103) S ( dotted and dashed line ) . G proteins were preloaded with 40 (cid:109) M GTP (cid:103) S , and then added to high speed supernatants containing pyrene actin . ( B ) As in A , but viewed with rhodamine actin . The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 140 , 1998 1134 amount is not uniformly distributed in the cell , our results suggest that local concentrations of PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 could be high enough to drive actin assembly in cells . Ac - tin assembly induced by these phosphoinositides is satura - ble at relatively low levels of PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and this is not due to saturation of downstream factors . Satura - tion has also been observed for the inhibition of gelsolin ( Janmey and Stossel , 1989 ) and the activation of (cid:98) - adren - ergic receptor kinase ( Pitcher et al . , 1995 ) . This is possibly due to the limited surface area of the vesicle . Alterna - tively , phosphoinositides in a PC / PI bilayer might form mi - crodomains or boundaries within the bilayer , affecting their interaction with downstream proteins . The extracts also contain excess downstream factors because actin po - lymerization increases linearly with the concentration of lipid vesicles up to 100 (cid:109) M . If the lipid / protein ratio used in our experiments was close to that in cells , we would con - clude that Xenopus eggs and perhaps somatic cells would never exhaust their downstream machinery for nucleating actin polymerization . Small G proteins of the Rho family are also able to induce actin assembly in Xenopus extracts . GTP (cid:103) S can stimulate both endogenous membranes and purified lipid vesicles to assemble actin . RhoGDI blocks not only the GTP (cid:103) S - induced actin assembly , but also phosphoinositide - induced activity . All these results can be explained by the participa - tion of the Rho family G proteins . Cdc42V12 rescues RhoGDI inhibition ( Fig . 6 A ) . Dominant negative Cdc42N17 , but not RacN17 , inhibits phosphoinositide - induced actin assembly ( Fig . 6 B ) . These results suggest that Cdc42 is involved in actin assembly induced by PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . Cdc42 also appears to be the target for GTP (cid:103) S , since Cdc42N17 inhibits GTP (cid:103) S - stimulated phospho - inositide - dependent actin assembly ( Fig . 6 ) . However , the inhibition is partial , suggesting that other members of the Rho family also mediate GTP (cid:103) S - induced assembly . More strikingly , exogenous Cdc42 , when charged with GTP (cid:103) S , is sufficient to induce actin assembly . Actin polymerization induced by GTP (cid:103) S and Cdc42 has been observed in cell lysates from polymorphonuclear leu - kocytes and Dictyostelium ( Zigmond et al . , 1997 ) . Bundles and meshworks of F - actin are observed using phalloidin in the low speed lysates from these cells . In our extracts when rhodamine actin is used , the morphology of F - actin induced by GTP (cid:103) S is similar but has additional features , possibly due to different extract concentrations and assay methods . F - actin does not only assemble into localized foci around endogenous vesicles , but also incorporates into moving comet tails . The comet tails and vesicle movements bear striking similarity to Listeria motility ( Theriot et al . , 1994 ; Marchand et al . , 1995 ) , endosome rocketing induced by lanthanides in macrophages ( Heuser , J . E . , and J . H . Mor - isaki . 1992 . Mol . Biol . Cell . 3 : 172a ) and “inductopodia” observed in Aplysia growth cones ( Forscher et al . , 1992 ) . Conceivably , the mechanism for these actin - based motili - ties might be very similar . The effects of phosphoinositides and Rho - family small G proteins on actin assembly in Xenopus egg extracts ap - pear to be dependent on each other . First , phosphoinosi - tide - containing membranes are required for localized ac - tin assembly : ( a ) GTP (cid:103) S induces actin assembly only in low speed extracts , but not in extracts depleted of endoge - nous membranes , presumably containing phosphoino - sitides ; ( b ) exogenous lipid vesicles containing phospho - inositides induce actin assembly in these vesicle - depleted extracts ; ( c ) only in the presence of exogenous phospho - inositide - containing vesicles does GTP (cid:103) S induce actin as - sembly . Second , phosphoinositide - induced assembly requires small G proteins : ( a ) RhoGDI inhibits GTP (cid:103) S - induced actin assembly ; ( b ) RhoGDI inhibits phosphoinositide - induced assembly ; ( c ) dominant negative Cdc42 blocks phosphoinositide - induced assembly . The requirement of phosphoinositides for GTP (cid:103) S - stim - ulated actin assembly can be explained by two scenarios : ( a ) they stimulate an GEF activity to activate G proteins , or ( b ) they promote translocation of G proteins to the membrane and serve as docking surfaces for activated G proteins to nucleate actin assembly . It has been shown re - cently that GEF activities are required for GTP (cid:103) S - stimu - lated actin assembly in high speed supernatants from poly - morphonuclear leukocytes , and anionic phospholipids allow GTP (cid:103) S to induce actin assembly ( Zigmond et al . , 1997 ) . However , the latter scenario would explain our re - sults better because we have observed different lipid spec - ificity depending on the nucleotides used ( see below ) . Small G proteins contain a CAAX box at their COOH ter - minals and are modified by prenylation . Although they may interact with other proteins , prenyl groups are known to be important for protein - membrane association . In the cytosol , the attached prenyl group is embedded in RhoGDI , which keeps G proteins in GDP forms ( Boguski and McCormick , 1993 ) . Phosphoinositides have recently been shown to dissociate RhoGDI from the inactive Rac - GDI complex ( Chuang et al . , 1993 ) . Therefore , the re - quirement of phosphoinositides in our system is consistent with the model that phosphoinositides translocate G pro - tein to membranes . Endogenous small G proteins are likely to be brought to the membrane by phosphoinosi - tides and activated by nonhydrolyzable GTP (cid:103) S through basal nucleotide exchange . Actin assembly then occurs from membrane - associated GTP (cid:103) S - activated G proteins . Further studies will be necessary to investigate the mecha - nism of this protein translocation and determine whether other cytosolic factors are required . The requirement of phosphoinositides for actin assem - bly has another interesting aspect . We have observed very different lipid specificities depending on the nucleotide used . In the presence of endogenous GTP ( but in the ab - sence of GTP (cid:103) S ) , only extremely specific phosphoinosi - tides , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 , induce actin assembly ( Fig . 3 B ) . In contrast , the specificity is broadened when GTP (cid:103) S is added and PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 , PI ( 4 ) P , and PI ( 3 ) P are now able to induce actin assembly ( Fig . 4 B ) . A simple explana - tion for the difference in specificity is that only PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , but not other phosphoinositides , stimulate a GEF activity , a physiological means to activate G proteins . In the presence of GTP (cid:103) S , the GEF activity is no longer required for G protein activation . Lipid specificity is re - laxed because phosphoinositides are only needed for the G protein - membrane interaction ( Fig . 8 ) . All known GEFs for the Rho family contain the pleckstrin homology ( PH ) domain ( Cerione and Zheng , 1996 ) , a 120 amino acid – long sequence thought to be important for interac - tion with phosphoinositides ( Shaw , 1996 ) . Three related Ma et al . Actin Assembly in Xenopus Egg Extracts 1135 proteins , cytohesin - 1 , ARNO , and Grp1 , which all have an amino - terminal PH domain and a sequence highly similar to an exchange factor have recently been identified ( Char - din et al . , 1996 ; Kolanus et al . , 1996 ; Klarlund et al . , 1997 ) . In addition , some PH domains have been shown to prefer - entially bind to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 compared with PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 or other phosphoinositides ( Rameh et al . , 1997 ) . These data suggest that PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 may re - cruit a GEF to the membrane and activate G proteins in the vicinity . Alternatively , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 may itself activate G proteins since in vitro studies have indicated that PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 can function as an exchange factor ( Zheng et al . , 1996 ) . Our data suggest that actin assembly through small G proteins is dependent on phosphoinositides at two steps : association with membranes and activation by GEF activ - ities . However , the dependence on phosphoinositides seems to be bypassed when exogenous GTP (cid:103) S - activated Cdc42 is added to the extracts , as long as it contains an in - tact CAAX motif for prenylation . In this nonphysiological situation , Cdc42 is activated by GTP (cid:103) S instead of GEFs , and actin assembly is associated with Cdc42 aggregates in - stead of lipid membranes . We believe that the aggregation of Cdc42 is essential for actin polymerization , since soluble forms of Cdc42 ( Cdc42V12C189S ) are completely ineffec - tual in stimulating actin assembly in the absence of phos - phoinositides ( Fig . 7 A ) . However , since prenylation at the CAAX box may have other functions , we can not rule out that soluble Cdc42 proteins are also able to stimulate actin assembly . The establishment of quantitative assays for ac - tin assembly in response to Cdc42 and specific phospho - inositides offers us an opportunity to identify and purify factors regulating actin assembly at the cell membrane .

Phosphoinositides of broad specificity dissociate RhoGDI from the complex and bring Cdc42 to the membrane through the pre - nyl group . Cdc42 is then activated in the presence of specific phosphoinositides ( i . e . , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 or PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ) , which either re - cruits a GEF or directly acts as a GEF . Alternatively , GTP (cid:103) S can activate Cdc42 at this step ( not shown here ) . In both cases , acti - vated Cdc42 leads to actin assembly at the cell membrane .
