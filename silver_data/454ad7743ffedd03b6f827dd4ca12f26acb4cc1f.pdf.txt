Poincaré , Garches , France . Mycolactone is a diffusible lipid secreted by the human pathogen Mycobacterium ulcerans , which induces the formation of open skin lesions referred to as Buruli ulcers . Here , we show that mycolactone operates by hijack - ing the Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ) family of actin - nucleating factors . By disrupting WASP autoinhibition , mycolactone leads to uncontrolled activation of ARP2 / 3 - mediated assembly of actin in the cytoplasm . In epithelial cells , mycolactone - induced stimulation of ARP2 / 3 concentrated in the perinuclear region , resulting in defective cell adhesion and directional migration . In vivo injection of mycolactone into mouse ears consistently altered the junctional organization and stratification of keratinocytes , leading to epi - dermal thinning , followed by rupture . This degradation process was efficiently suppressed by coadministra - tion of the N - WASP inhibitor wiskostatin . These results elucidate the molecular basis of mycolactone activity and provide a mechanism for Buruli ulcer pathogenesis . Our findings should allow for the rationale design of competitive inhibitors of mycolactone binding to N - WASP , with anti – Buruli ulcer therapeutic potential . Introduction Mycolactone is an original polyketide metabolite synthesized by Mycobacterium ulcerans , the causative agent of Buruli ulcer ( 1 ) . The life cycle of M . ulcerans is not fully understood , but there is evidence that Buruli ulcer is transmitted via insect bites ( reviewed in ref . 2 ) . Lesions typically start as a subcutaneous nodule , edema , or plaque that enlarges over time . The epidermis eventually breaks down to reveal a characteristic wound bor - dered by necrotic tissues ( 3 ) . Mycolactone is essential for bacte - rial virulence and , in intradermally injected animal models , is sufficient to induce Buruli ulcer – like lesions that are marked by extensive necrosis and lack of inflammation ( 4 ) . In vitro , mycolactone diffuses passively into the cytoplasm of mamma - lian cells to induce apoptotic cell death , although with highly variable efficacy ( 5 ) . Anchorage - dependent cells are the most susceptible to mycolactone toxicity , which proceeds through cytoskeletal rearrangements and detachment ( 6 – 8 ) . Intriguingly , at noncytotoxic doses , mycolactone also alters key functions of immune cells , such as cell trafficking and TLR - induced cytokine production ( 9 – 15 ) . How mycolactone mediates these effects has thus far remained unknown . Given the pivotal role played by the cytoskeleton in controlling many biological processes , we reasoned that a common denomi - nator of the activities described above could be alterations in actin dynamics . Our investigations have led us to identify Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ) and neural WASP ( N - WASP ) as molecular targets of mycolactone . Along with Scar / WAVE - 1 – WAVE - 3 , WASP and N - WASP constitute a family of scaffold proteins transducing a variety of signals into dynamic remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton , via interaction of their C - terminal verprolin - cofilin - acidic ( VCA ) domain with the ARP2 / 3 actin - nucleating complex ( reviewed in ref . 16 ) . In basal conditions , WASP and N - WASP are autoinhibited by intramolecular interactions sequestering the VCA domain from ARP2 / 3 . Binding of activated GTPases or phosphoinositide lipids to N - terminal target sequences triggers conformational changes result - ing in release of the VCA , thereby enabling binding and activation of ARP2 / 3 ( reviewed in ref . 17 ) . WASP expression is restricted to hema - topoietic cells , with loss - or gain - of - function mutations leading to a complex syndrome of immune defects , whereas N - WASP is more widely expressed ( 18 ) . These proteins play a crucial role at the cellular level in endocytosis ( 19 ) , immune synapse formation , signaling , adhe - sion , and migration ( 16 , 20 ) . At the tissue level , they are crucial for the maintenance of skin integrity , as shown by distorted junctions of N - WASP – depleted epithelial cells ( 21 , 22 ) and spontaneous ulcer - ations in mice with conditional N - WASP deletion in the skin ( 23 ) . Using a combination of biochemical assays , cellular imaging , and animal models , we here revealed that mycolactone mimics Authorship note : Laure Guenin - Macé and Romain Veyron - Churlet contributed equally to this work .

We showed that myco - lactone - induced activation of N - WASP in epithelial cells and the consequent dynamic rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton dra - matically impaired the integrity of the epidermis , thus providing a molecular mechanism underpinning Buruli ulcer pathogenesis . Results Mycolactone binds selectively to the WASP / N - WASP regulators of actin polymerization . To analyze the effect of mycolactone on the cytoskel - eton , we selected the HeLa cell line , as a model of anchorage - depen - dent cells of the human epithelial system , and the Jurkat cell line of human T lymphocytes , to reflect the activity of mycolactone on nonadherent , immune cells . Cells were treated with mycolactone for 5 – 60 minutes , then fixed and stained with fluorophore - coupled phalloidin . As shown in Figure 1A , HeLa cells exposed to mycolac - tone for 30 minutes produced filopodes , whereas a 5 - minute treat - ment induced the transient formation of a large lamellipode in Jur - kat cells . These observations showed that mycolactone affects the cytoskeleton in a cell - specific manner , with the filopode and lamel - lipode induction suggesting a modulation of actin dynamics down - stream of the RAC / CDC42 GTPases . To address this possibility , we investigated a possible interaction of mycolactone with WASP , N - WASP , or p21 - activated kinase ( PAK ) , since they mediate RAC / CDC42 signals to the actin cytoskeleton via their interactive bind - ing ( CRIB ) domain ( Figure 1B ) . Mycolactone was modified to allow covalent attachment of a biotinyl group at the end of its polyun - saturated side chain . The resulting adduct retained the biological properties of native mycolactone , as evidenced by its cytopathic and immunosuppressive activity on HeLa and Jurkat cells , respectively ( Supplemental Figure 1 ; supplemental material available online with this article ; doi : 10 . 1172 / JCI66576DS1 ) . Biotinylated myco - lactone was then used in ELISA to assess binding to the GTPase - binding domain ( GBD ) of WASP , N - WASP , and PAK , expressed as glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) fusion proteins ( Figure 1C , CR1 constructs ) . Strikingly , mycolactone bound significantly and dose - dependently to the CR1 domain of WASP and N - WASP , but not to that of PAK ( Figure 1D , left ) . To investigate the respective contributions of the lysine - rich basic region ( BR ) and the CRIB domain in CR1 , we measured the reactivity of a series of constructs missing part or all of these motifs ( Figure 1C ) . In both WASP and N - WASP , mycolactone binding was abolished when the BR was incomplete ( Figure 1D , middle ) . How - ever , the presence of the BR was not sufficient , as shown by the lack of reactivity of CR3 in N - WASP . Residues located upstream of the BR were not required and even diminished interaction , as evidenced by the highest reactivity of CR7 compared with CR1 and CR6 ( Figure 1D , middle and right ) . Neither of the complementary CR7 subfragments CR8 and CR11 showed binding to mycolac - tone . Reactivity was partially restored with CR10 , which indicates that an intact 222 – 276 region in N - WASP is essential . In contrast , CR9 showed no reactivity to mycolactone , further demonstrat - ing that the BR / CRIB region is necessary but not sufficient for optimal binding . However , addition of the CRIB domain to CR10 ( i . e . , CR2 ) did not improve reactivity . Together , these results sug - gested that mycolactone binding to N - WASP involves a primary interaction site situated downstream of the CRIB in the 222 – 276 region and a secondary site in the BR . Of all the constructs exam - ined , CR1 in WASP and CR7 in N - WASP constituted the minimal linear domains binding mycolactone , and were therefore selected for further studies . The dissociation constants of mycolactone for CR1 and CR7 were determined by a titration assay based on tryp - tophan fluorescence . They were found to be comparable , in the 20 - to 70 - nM range ( Supplemental Figure 2 ) . Mycolactone binding to WASPs results in CDC42 - independent hyper - activation . Since WASP and N - WASP use the ARP2 / 3 complex to stimulate actin assembly via filament branching , once the auto - inhibition is relieved by binding of GTP - loaded CDC42 ( CDC42 - GTP ) ( 24 , 25 ) , we next used a pyrene fluorescence assay to exam - ine whether mycolactone affects N - WASP activity . We found that mycolactone induced dose - dependent stimulation of the actin polymerization activity of N - WASP ( Figure 2A ) . The maximum rate of actin assembly showed a saturation behavior , with an equi - librium dissociation constant of 170 nM ( Supplemental Figure 3 ) . In agreement with the above observation that mycolactone bound the GBD of N - WASP , mycolactone was unable to pro - mote ARP2 / 3 - dependent polymerization of actin in the absence of N - WASP , nor could it stimulate a N - WASP mutant lacking the GBD ( data not shown ) . CR7 inhibited mycolactone - induced activation of N - WASP in a dose - dependent manner , with a half - effect of 0 . 25 μ M at 32 nM N - WASP ( Figure 2B ) , which indicates that mycolactone binds CR7 and N - WASP with similar affinity . As controls , CR2 and CR3 did not modify the mycolactone - induced activation of N - WASP ( Figure 2C ) . Binding of CDC42 - GTP to the GBD in WASP / N - WASP triggers transition from an autoinhibited state , in which the VCA domain is sequestered by intramolecular binding to the GBD , into an active state , where released VCA can bind ARP2 / 3 ( 24 , 25 ) . Since the primary interaction site of mycolactone ( 222 – 276 in N - WASP ) contains most of the residues accounting for the autoinhibited fold ( 25 ) , we investigated whether mycolactone affects intramolec - ular interactions . WASP CR1 was immobilized on beads and used to capture recombinant VCA . The resulting complex was then incubated with mycolactone , and VCA dissociation was monitored by pulldown assay . A dose - dependent release of CR1 - bound VCA was induced by mycolactone ( Figure 2D ) , which demonstrated that mycolactone disrupts WASP autoinhibition . We then asked whether mycolactone interferes with CDC42 - mediated activation of WASPs , and vice versa . Mycolactone did not modify the binding of CDC42 - GTP to immobilized WASP CR1 or N - WASP CR7 ( data not shown ) . The maximal activation reached by mycolactone - bound N - WASP in actin assembly assays was more pronounced than that induced by CDC42 ( Figure 2E ) . Moreover , the dose - dependent activation of N - WASP induced by mycolactone was independent of the presence of CDC42 - GTP .

Like CDC42 , mycolactone activate WASPs by releasing the VCA from the GBD . However , with a 100 - fold higher affinity ( 26 ) , mycolactone is a much stronger activator of N - WASP – mediated actin assembly . Mycolactone activates cellular WASP / N - WASP to promote actin assem - bly . To evaluate the physiological relevance of these findings , we then coated latex beads with mycolactone , incubated them with N - WASP , and placed them in Jurkat cell extracts spiked with fluorescently labeled actin . A fluorescent signal readily devel - oped at the surface of mycolactone - coated beads incubated with N - WASP , but not control beads that either had not been coated with mycolactone or had not been incubated with N - WASP ( Fig - ure 3A ) , which demonstrated that N - WASP activated by mycolac - tone could induce the formation of branched actin filaments in a cellular environment . We then took advantage of a fluorescent derivative of mycolactone to study its distribution in living cells ( Supplemental Figure 4 and ref . 27 ) . As shown in Figure 3B , myco - lactone was distributed primarily in the cytosolic compartment of treated Jurkat cells . A limited , but significant , colocalization with active WASP was observed after 1 hour , using an antibody that preferentially binds the open form of the protein ( Figure 3B ) . Notably , spots of ARP2 / 3 complex were detected in the area of Bodipy - mycolactone / active WASP colocalization , which indicates that mycolactone reaches the sites of WASP - mediated ARP2 / 3 acti - vation . After 4 hours , immunofluorescence detection of ARP2 / 3 revealed an increased level of activated complex in the perinuclear area of HeLa cells ( Figure 3C ) . These alterations persisted for more than 16 hours and were efficiently suppressed by coincubation with the N - WASP inhibitor wiskostatin ( 28 ) . They were not due to increased protein level , as expression of WASP , N - WASP , the p34 subunit of ARP2 / 3 ( p34 - ARP2 / 3 ) , and actin was unchanged in mycolactone - treated cells ( Figure 3D ) . Taken together , the data in Figure 3 indicated that mycolactone promotes perinuclear recruit - ment and activation of ARP2 / 3 by N - WASP . Activation of N - WASP in epithelial cells mediates mycolactone - induced adhesion defects .

Live imaging of HeLa cells exposed to mycolactone revealed that the early induction of spike - like protrusions was followed by lamellipodium retraction ( Fig - ure 4A ) . If exposure to mycolactone was prolonged over 24 hours , this process culminated in cell rounding and detachment ( Figure 4 , A and B ) . Induction of cell apop - tosis , as measured by caspase activation ( early stages ) and membrane permeability to propidium iodide ( late stages ) , was primarily observed in the detached fraction of mycolactone - treated cells ( Figure 4C ) , which strongly suggested that mycolactone kills epithelial cells by anoi - kis . Strikingly , 4 hours of exposure to mycolactone was sufficient to induce a near - complete and persistent inca - pacity to adhere to plastic wells ( Figure 4D ) . This effect was counteracted by wiskostatin or by prior transfection of the cells with WASP CR1 ( Figure 4 , D and E ) , demon - strating its association with activated N - WASP . In HeLa cell monolayers treated with mycolactone for 16 hours , cell retraction was associated with a marked reduction in the number of intercellular contacts ( Figure 5A ) . Cadherin staining showed that mycolactone sup - pressed both the maintenance of mature cell - cell junc - tions and the active formation of new interfaces via an adhesion zipper ( Figure 5B ) . In polarized systems , such as the MDCK cell line model , mycolactone induced marked suppression of adherens and tight junctions , as shown by the decrease in the fluorescent ring – like signal of cadher - ins and zona occludens – 1 ( ZO - 1 ; Figure 5C ) . Confocal imaging of basal sections revealed decreased stress fibers , increased perinuclear actin rings , and impaired mem - brane localization of cadherin in mycolactone - treated cells , resulting in disruption of the honeycomb - like organization and , eventually , rupture of the monolayer ( Figure 5 , D and E ) .

The potential effect of mycolactone on HeLa cell displacement was therefore evaluated in a wound - healing assay . As shown in Figure 6A , mycolactone - exposed cells had an impaired capacity to close wounds . This was not due to decreased cell motility , as mycolactone - treated cells moved faster than vehicle - exposed controls ( Figure 6B ) . However , the direc - tionality of their movement was altered : cell trajectories were not linear and perpendicular to the wound ( x axis ) like those of con - trol cells , resulting in shorter displacements ( Figure 6B ) . Prior transfection of the cells with WASP CR1 abrogated the mycolac - tone - induced alterations in speed and directionality and partially restored healing capacity ( Figure 6 , C and D ) , which suggests that mycolactone binding to endogenous N - WASP is critically involved in these defects . Hyperactivation of epithelial N - WASP underpins epidermal rupture . The human epidermis is a stratified squamous epithelium com - posed of proliferating basal keratinocytes attached to a basement membrane and suprabasal keratinocyte layers at various stages of differentiation ( from base to top : spinosum , granulosum , lucidum , and corneum ) . The maintenance of cell - cell contacts and the directionality of cell migration perpendicularly to the basement membrane have been shown to be critical for the main - tenance of skin integrity ( reviewed in ref . 30 ) . Since mycolactone - induced activation of N - WASP affects both adhesion and direction sensing of epithelial cells , we investigated its effect on epidermal integrity in the mouse ear model , focusing on the events preceding tissue destruction and ulcer formation ( Supplemental Figure 5 ) . As soon as 2 days after injection , we observed progressive thin - ning of the external stratum granulosum and lucidum ( Figure 7 , A and B ) , resulting in a significant decrease in epidermis width after 54 hours ( Figure 7C ) . In agreement with our observation on cultured cells , remodeling of the epidermal layers was associated with a dramatic loss of E - cadherin – adhesive contacts , particularly in the stratum spinosum ( Figure 7D ) . Importantly , coadministra - tion of wiskostatin suppressed mycolactone - induced dissociation and thinning of the epidermis ( Figure 7 , D and E ) , demonstrating the importance of N - WASP activation in this process .

Numerous bacterial effectors , such as IcsA / VirG of Shigella flexneri ( 31 ) and TccP / EspFu of the entero - hemorrhagic Escherichia coli ( 32 ) , target WASP / N - WASP in host cells . However , mycolactone is the first example of a nonprotein factor interfering with these actin - nucleating factors . Unlike IcsA and EspFu , which require translocation into target cells , mycolac - tone gains access to WASPs by passive diffusion through the plas - ma membrane ( 8 ) . Mycolactone bound N - WASP 100 - fold more strongly than its major regulator , CDC42 ( 26 ) , leading to a much greater capacity to stimulate actin assembly in vitro . The ARP2 / 3 complex has previously been shown to induce a slight shift in the autoinhibitory equilibrium of WASP , facilitating CDC42 - induced opening and activation ( 26 ) . We found that ARP2 / 3 comparably potentiated mycolactone - induced release of WASP CR1 – bound VCA ( data not shown ) . This property , combined with its high affinity for WASPs , should enable mycolactone to efficiently dis - connect WASPs from endogenous regulation in vivo . Mycolactone counteracted the effects of the N - WASP inhibitor wisko statin in cellular assays . Consistent with the fact that wisko - Figure 5 Effect of mycolactone on epithelial cell - cell contacts .

Accordingly , the defects caused by mycolactone in migrat - ing epithelial cells ( e . g . , increased speed of cell migration and loss of directionality ) were comparable to those induced by delocal - ization of ARP2 expression from leading protrusions to the peri - nuclear area ( 34 ) . The decreased capacity of mycolactone - exposed cells to extend cadherin - adhesive contacts was similar to that pre - viously observed upon sequestration of ARP2 / 3 by exogenously expressing the CA region of N - WASP ( 35 ) . Our data in Figure 4 showed that mycolactone - induced kill - ing of epithelial cells was primarily caused by N - WASP – mediated detachment and subsequent anoikis . This mechanism obviously statin inhibits N - WASP activity by stabilizing the autoinhibited con - formation , we found that mycolactone relieves the intramolecular contacts that maintain WASP autoinhibition . Intriguingly , mycolac - tone binding to WASPs involved the BR , which is located immediately upstream of the CRIB . Phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - disphosphate ( PiP 2 ) micelles react with arginine and lysine residues clustered in this region to activate WASPs at both the allosteric level and the oligomerization level ( 33 ) . NMR studies will help to determine whether mycolactone exploits this mechanism and to provide structural insight into the hyperactive conformation of the mycolactone – N - WASP complex . In HeLa cells exposed to mycolactone , ARP2 / 3 was primarily detected in the perinuclear area , which suggests that mycolac - Figure 6 Mycolactone impairs directed migration of epithelial cells .

Our observation that mycolactone induced lamellipode formation in T cells ( Figure 1A ) strongly suggests that it may also alter the T cell spreading response to activation . Contrary to N - WASP , WASP is not essential and can be silenced without a major effect on viability . Study of animal models deficient for WASP expression or expressing WASP cannot explain mycolactone cytotoxicity in anchorage - indepen - dent cells , such as T lymphocytes ( 11 ) . Activating mutations in WASP have been shown to increase apoptosis in T cells by pro - moting genomic instability , providing a possible mechanism for the mild cytopathic activity of mycolactone in this cell population ( 36 ) . With regard to its immunomodulatory properties , recent studies indicating that WASP is an epigenetic regulator of Th1 Figure 7 Remodeling of the skin epidermis after mycolactone administration .

Micropatterns were purchased from Cytoo , and cell plating was performed as recommended by the manufacturer . When appropriate , wiskostatin was added to HeLa cells at a final concentration of 1 μ M for 24 hours . This low - dose treatment had no detectable effect on cytokinesis or ATP levels ( data not shown and refs . 44 , 45 ) . The induction of early / late cell apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry using the Poly - Caspases Flica assay ( Immunochemistry ) and Sytox - green nucleic acid stain . Immunofluorescence microscopy . Cells were fixed for 15 minutes at room temperature ( RT ) with PBS plus 3 % paraformaldehyde , washed with PBS , and incubated with NH 4 Cl ( 50 mM ) in PBS for 10 minutes at RT , prior to incubation with primary and secondary antibodies in PBS plus 5 % BSA and 0 . 05 % saponin for 1 hour at RT . Actin was labeled with rhodamine phalloidin , cadherin with anti – pan - cadherin mouse monoclonal CH - 19 ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , ZO - 1 with rabbit polyclonal 61 - 300 ( Zymed ) , and N - WASP with guinea pig polyclonal antibody ( provided by M . D . Welch , University of California , Berke - ley , California , USA ) . Cell areas and junctions were measured manually on Image J pictures of actin / cadherin - stained cells . For colocalization studies , Jurkat T cells were stained with 26E6 anti - WASP monoclonal Ab ( provided by J . K . Burkhardt , University of Pennsylvania , Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , USA ) , which is specific for the active form of the protein . WASP and Bodipy - mycolactone fluorescence signals were deconvoluted with Huygens profes - sional software ( Scientific Volume Imaging ) , and colocalization was analyzed by calculating the Pearson coefficient with the Jacop plugin of ImageJ , using Costes’s automatic threshold method ( 46 , 47 ) . For ARP2 / 3 staining , HeLa cells were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde in cytoskeletal stabilization buf - fer ( 10 mM PIPES , pH 6 . 8 ; 100 mM KCl ; 300 mM sucrose ; 2 mM EGTA ; and 2 mM MgCl 2 ) for 20 minutes , then permeabilized with 0 . 25 % Triton X - 100 in PBS for 10 minutes at RT . Cells were stained with a rabbit anti – p34 - Arc / ARPC2 polyclonal antiserum ( 1 : 400 dilution ; Upstate ) and anti - rabbit Cy3 ( 1 : 800 dilution ) , both in PBS plus 1 % BSA . Image analysis was performed with a custom - designed script developed using Acapella Image analysis software ( version 2 . 5 ; Perkin Elmer ) . This script was based on nuclei segmentation , allowing the definition of a perinuclear ring of fixed thickness ( 6 pixels ) . For each nucleus ( n > 50 ) , the intensity of p34 - ARP2 / 3 staining per unit of ring surface was calculated and integrated on 4 consecutive z sections ( 0 . 45 μ m ) , then exported in a readable file format for statistical analysis . Actin polymerization assays . Actin was purified from rabbit skeletal mus - cle ( 48 ) , and the monomeric G form was purified by gel filtration and labeled with pyrenyl iodoacetamide or Alexa Fluor 488 succinimidyl ester ( Invitrogen ) . The ARP2 / 3 complex was purified from bovine brain ( 31 ) . The time course of actin polymerization was monitored spectrofluoro - metrically in a Safas Xenius instrument using the increase in pyrenyl actin fluorescence as a probe , with excitation and emission wavelengths of 366 and 407 nm , respectively . Polymerization was assayed at 2 . 5 μ m G - actin ( 5 % pyrenyl labeled ) , with 28 nm ARP2 / 3 complex and 32 nm N - WASP in the presence of mycolactone or solvent as control . The buffer contained 5 mM Tris - Cl ( pH 8 ) , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 1 M KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , and 0 . 2 mM EGTA . When required , CDC42 was loaded with GTP - gS by a 30 - minute incubation at RT with 1 mM GTP - gS in 5 mM EDTA . For actin polymerization on beads , streptavidin - latex 2 - μ m beads were incubated with 12 . 5 μ M biotinylated mycolactone ( or vehicle as control ) for 15 min - utes , rinsed , incubated with 400 nM N - WASP for 30 minutes ( or buffer as control ) , rinsed , placed into Jurkat cell homogenates spiked with 1 . 5 μ M G - actin ( 10 % Alexa Fluor 488 ) plus 1 . 2 mM ATP and 2 . 4 mM MgCl 2 , and analyzed for fluorescence after 2 hours at RT . Cell adhesion assays . We used the Vybrant calcein - AM – based assay of cell adhesion ( Molecular Probes ) . Briefly , HeLa cells grown in microplate wells were treated with mycolactone or vehicle , then detached and loaded with the cytoplasmic marker calcein - AM . Labeled cells were then left to adhere mutants that are unable to bind mycolactone should help to dis - sect the contribution of this key immune regulator to mycolactone activity in the hematopoietic cell compartment . Currently available techniques do not allow for precise quanti - fication of mycolactone concentration in infected tissues ( 38 , 39 ) . We chose to inject 5 μ g mycolactone into mouse ears , as within 2 weeks , this dose reproduces the characteristic lesions develop - ing after months in mice infected with M . ulcerans ( 40 ) . Consistent with our observation that mycolactone suppressed cell - cell con - tacts in polarized epithelia ( Figure 5 ) , our histopathological analy - sis of mycolactone - injected skin revealed profound alterations in E - cadherin junctions and epidermal architecture , which suggests that uncontrolled activation of N - WASP impairs epithelial differ - entiation in this tissue . Since mycolactone - induced thinning of the skin was suppressed by wiskostatin , we propose that hyperacti - vation of N - WASP ( and consequent dissociation of epithelial cells ) is the primary cause of epidermal destruction in Buruli ulcers . Pathogens often modulate the host actin cytoskeleton to enhance their propagation and survival ( 41 ) . M . ulcerans does not survive at the core temperature of the human body and multiplies extracellularly in disintegrated skin tissues . This environment , and the associated release of nutrients by dead cells , may constitute a favorable niche for the growth of M . ulcerans in an infected host . By targeting WASP and N - WASP , mycolactone has the potential to affect the functional biology of both immune and nonimmune cell populations . Further investigations will be required to deter - mine whether WASP - mediated functions are altered by mycolac - tone in hematopoietic cells , and to what extent these alterations contribute to the immune defects of M . ulcerans – infected hosts . Our present results suggest that modulation of mycolactone - induced N - WASP activation in the skin might counteract the ulcerative effects of mycolactone and represent a viable strategy to treat Buruli ulcers . This hypothesis was supported by preliminary results showing that local injection of wiskostatin limited the epi - dermal remodeling preceding ulceration in M . ulcerans – infected mice ( our unpublished observations ) . Resolving the structure of the mycolactone / WASP complex should identify the contact amino acids . Drugs mimicking the binding site of mycolactone in WASP may represent inhibitors of interest for treating this debili - tating human disease ( 42 ) . Methods Reagents . Mycolactone was purified from M . ulcerans 1615 ( ATCC 35840 ) and quantified as described previously ( 4 , 43 ) . Stock solutions were prepared in methanol . Wiskostatin ( Sigma - Aldrich ) was in DMSO . Both reagents were diluted at least × 10 in PBS before injection in animals and at least × 1 , 000 in culture medium for cellular assays . In all cases , mycolactone - and wiskostatin - treated samples were compared with vehicle - treated controls . WASP and N - WASP constructs . The CR1 – CR7 constructs corresponding to WASP / N - WASP domains were provided by C . Egile ( Institut Pasteur ) or generated in our laboratory . The CR8 – CR11 constructs were derived from N - WASP CR7 for the purpose of this study . The WASP VCA construct was provided by M . K . Rosen ( University of Texas Southwestern Medical Cen - ter , Dallas , Texas , USA ) . GST - tagged WASP / N - WASP and His 6 - tagged VCA constructs were produced in BL21 E . coli according to standard induction and purification procedures . Human N - WASP was expressed in Sf9 cells using the baculovirus system . Cell cultures and viability assays .
