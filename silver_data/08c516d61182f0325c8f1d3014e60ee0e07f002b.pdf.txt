Pucadyil , 4 Joshua Zimmerberg , 5 Sandra L . Schmid , 6 Vadim A . Frolov 1 , 7 † Biological membrane fission requires protein - driven stress . The guanosine triphosphatase ( GTPase ) dynamin builds up membrane stress by polymerizing into a helical collar that constricts the neck of budding vesicles . How this curvature stress mediates nonleaky membrane remodeling is actively debated . Using lipid nanotubes as substrates to directly measure geometric intermediates of the fission pathway , we found that GTP hydrolysis limits dynamin polymerization into short , metastable collars that are optimal for fission . Collars as short as two rungs translated radial constriction to reversible hemifission via membrane wedging of the pleckstrin homology domains ( PHDs ) of dynamin . Modeling revealed that tilting of the PHDs to conform with membrane deformations creates the low - energy pathway for hemifission . This local coordination of dynamin and lipids suggests how membranes can be remodeled in cells . C ellular membranes can merge ( fusion ) or split apart ( fission ) without compromis - ing their barrier function . This requires lipids to form localized , transient , nonbilayer struc - tures to initiate topological transition ( 1 – 4 ) , which in structurally stable lipid bilayers requires the application of membrane stresses ( 5 , 6 ) . Dynamin , the paradigmatic member of a superfamily of guanosine triphosphatases ( GTPases ) involved in membrane fusion and fission ( 7 – 9 ) , produces curvature stress by radial constriction of the necks of endocytic vesicles ( 7 ) . Fission follows con - striction if the membrane curvature approaches a critical level sufficient to trigger spontaneous lipid rearrangements ( 3 , 6 , 7 ) . Structural analy - ses of long dynamin helices suggest several pos - sible conformational changes and / or remodeling modes capable of converting the GTP energy into strong membrane constriction ( 10 – 14 ) . How - ever , both in vivo and in vitro , dynamin operates in small and transient units ( 6 , 15 , 16 ) . It remains uncertain whether plain radial constriction could support timely and nonleaky fission at these time and length scales . We hypothesized that tighter coordination between protein conformation and lipid rearrangements would be required to find an optimal trajectory of membrane remodeling . To test this hypothesis , we analyzed the progres - sion of membrane fission produced by dynamin - 1 ( hereafter , dynamin ) onlipidnanotubes ( NTs ) pulled from lipid bilayers ( 17 ) . On long 4 - to 20 - m m fluo - rescently labeled NTs , dynamin [ 0 . 5 to 4 m M ( 17 ) ] polymerized into cylindrical scaffolds that expelled both membrane and luminal fluorescence , thus constricting the NTs ( Fig . 1A , B ) . In the presence of 1 mM GTP , such constrictions were followed byfission ( moviesS1andS2 ) . Beforefission , GTP promoted stochastic disassembly of the growing dynamin scaffolds ( Fig . 1C and movies S1 to S3 ) ( 6 , 16 ) . However , in the assembled state , the av - erage membrane constriction was similar with and without GTP ( Fig . 1D and fig . S1 ) . Thus , instead of increasing the average NTconstriction ( Fig . 1D and fig . S1 ) ( 6 ) , GTP hydrolysis fueled dynamin reassembly cycles , seen as large oscillations of the length and position of individual dynamin scaf - folds on NTs ( Fig . 1 , E and F , and fig . S2 ) . These oscillationswerealsoevidentinfluctuationsoftheionicpermeability ( conductance G n , Fig . 2A ) of the lumen of short 80 - to 250 - nm NTs ( 6 ) . Al - though submicrometer scaffolds were sufficient to sever long NTs ( movie S4 ) , such small scaffolds underwent further disassembly to produce fission of short NTs ( Fig . 2A ) , confirming that dynamin fission activity is localized to the nanoscale . To quantify nanoscale fission events , we de - terminedtheradius ( R NT ) , length ( L NT ) , andelastic resistance of short cylindrical NTs ( figs . S3 and S4 ) ( 17 ) and used these to calculate the NT con - striction parameters from changes in G n . With - out GTP , dynamin produced stepwise decreases in G n ( Fig . 2B ) . This intermittent NT constric - tion implied either the formation of self - limited dynamin collars [ e . g . , rings ( 18 ) ] and / or lipid re - sistancecoming from swelling of the NT between dynamin scaffolds [ figs . S2 and S5 ( 12 – 14 , 19 ) ] . However , the final steady - state conductance G nf ( Fig . 2B ) indicated a uniformly constricted cylin - drical NT ( 6 ) . Its luminal radius , R Dyn , was cal - culated using Ohms law : R Dyn ¼ R NT ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ G fn = k D p [ where k D is the Debye correction ( 17 ) ] , yielding R Dyn = 1 . 9 T 0 . 3 nm ( n = 13 NTs ) . R Dyn did not depend on L NT ( fig . S6A ) , confirming uniform constriction . Considering dynamin scaffolds as cylinders creating similar membrane curvature with or without GTP ( Fig . 1D ) , the length of elementary scaffolds ( L s ) producing conductance steps and oscillations could be calculated from D G n ( Fig . 2 , A and B ) using the following equation ( 17 ) D ð 1 = G n Þ ¼ L s ½ð R NT = R Dyn Þ 2 = k D − 1 (cid:1) = L NT ð 1 Þ Cumulative distribution of L s ( Fig . 2C ) demon - strated that the scaffolds were substantially shorter in the presence of GTP than in its absence , and even shorter at the moment of fission ( D G nfission , Fig . 2A ) . Thus , GTP hydrolysis stimulated the optimization of the scaffold length for membrane fission . All three distributions of scaffold lengths ( Fig . 2C ) showed a clear cutoff at L s min ≈ 20 nm [ readily distinguishable from background noise ( fig . S7 ) ] , implying a “ minimal ” dynamin unit capable of constricting NTs and causing their fission . Assuming that the smallest conductance jumps measured in the presence of GTP were made by this minimal scaffold , we applied linear regression of D ( 1 / G n ) on R NT2 using Eq . 1 with L s = L smin . Such a fit ( Fig . 2D ) recovered L smin = 25 T 7 nm and R Dyn = 1 . 9 T 0 . 4 nm , confirming that the shortest scaffolds imposed the same lo - cal curvature with and without GTP . Because the pitch of a dynamin helix is ~ 10 nm ( 7 , 10 , 14 ) , fission required at least a two - rung dynamin scaf - fold , with two - to three - rung units mediating ~ 80 % of fission events ( Fig . 2C ) . In 10 % of the fission events , the initial closure of the NT lumen was reversible . As the flick - ering fission pores in cellular systems ( 20 , 21 ) , the NTs switched between “ open ” and “ closed ” states ( Fig . 3A ) . The latter apparently corre - sponded to hemifission , because GTP hydroly - sis rendered dynamin scaffolds metastable and incapable of withstanding membrane tension so that , upon fission , the NT rapidly retracted into the lipid bilayer reservoir ( Fig . 3B and movie S5 ) ( 6 , 16 , 22 ) . In the absence of GTP , stable dynamin scaffolds inhibited NTretraction ( Fig . 3B and movie S6 ) . The observed flicker was much faster ( tens of milliseconds , Fig . 3A ) than both the GTP hydrolysis cycle [ k cat ~ 2 s − 1 ( 23 , 24 ) ] and the reassembly of dynamin ( seconds , Fig . 2A ) . Thus , flicker was not caused by cooperative trans - formations of dynamin helices associated with GTPase activity [ such as constriction , extension , or twisting ( 11 , 18 , 22 , 25 ) ] or by the reassembly of dynamin scaffolds . Indeed , the open state was characterized by a preset conductance level ( Fig . 3A ) , indicating that the flickering NT was con - strained within a short dynamin scaffold of fixed geometry . Such two - to three - rung collars act as metastable catalytic centers mediating transitions between a constricted neck and hemifission , two main intermediates of fission . We next explored the molecular basis for hemifission catalysis , focusing on the membrane - 1 Biophysics Unit ( CSIC , UPV / EHU ) and Department of Bio - chemistry and Molecular Biology , University of the Basque Country , Leioa , Spain . 2 A .

The Ile → Ala ( I533A ) mutation in the membrane - inserting variable loop 1 ( VL1 ) of PHD suppresses fission without altering dynamin ’ s polymerization or GTPase activity ( 26 , 27 ) . The mutant ( I533A ) and wild - type ( WT ) dynamins produced similar changes in G n , both with and without GTP ( Fig . 3C , D ) . Thus , I533A formed short metastable collars imposing the same curvature stress as the WT . However , in the presenceofGTP , I533Afailed to produce hemifission or fission in seven out of eight trials , 150 s of observation each , whereas the WTsevered 24 of25short NTsin 33 . 6 T 4 . 6s after its addition to NTs . Thus , hemifission catalysis re - quires membrane wedging of PHDs in the meta - stable collar . The hemifission intermediate has a distinct hourglass ( “ stalk ” ) shape ( 3 , 7 ) , dramatically dif - ferent from the cylindrical shape of constricted NTs . On cylindrical NTs , PHD pairs in each rung of a dynamin collar form a long pedestal ori - ented along the NT axis [ Fig . 4A and fig . S8 ( 7 ) ] . For hemifission to occur , lipids must either detach from or move together with the PHDs . Simultaneous detachment from tens of PHDs in the rung is energetically improbable ( 17 ) .

S9 ) . Finally , flickerwasmuchfaster than dynamin detachment from the membrane [ seconds ( 26 ) ] , indicating that PHDs can quickly adapt their po - sition to lipids ( Fig . 4A ) . Analyzing the possibil - ity of PHD tilting theoretically , we found that the combination of tilting and membrane insertion promoted otherwise energetically unfavorable hemifission transformation ( 17 ) . PHD pairs as - sembled into membrane - inserting ring ( s ) were modeled , and the shallow insertion was param - eterized by its width H i in the axial direction ( Fig . 4A ) ( 17 ) . Without tilt , the energy barrier for hemifission remained high even for large H i ( Fig . 4B ) . With tilt , the barrier decreased steeply with increasing H i ( Fig . 4B , C ) , explaining the im - paired fission efficiency of I533A . For H i = 1 nm , the barrier became effectively zero for the two - ring system , revealing the soft deformation mode potentially responsible for fast flicker transitions ( Fig . 3A ) . Independent of H i , the two - ring ge - ometry remained optimal for fission , although PHD tilting significantly promoted fission me - diated by a single ring or at the edge of a rigid dynamin scaffold ( Fig . 4 , A and C ) ( 28 ) . Thus , the kinetics of fission appear to be determined by the extent of membrane wedging by PHDs and the number of PHDs simultaneously avail - able for tilting upon GTP hydrolysis , a stochastic function of the hydrolysis rate .

The narrowing beneath a single flexible PHD ring ( left ) is further assisted by an adjacent rigid scaffold ( middle ) or a second flexible ring ( right ) , L ring = 12 nm ( the pitch of dynamin helix ) . The narrowing results in a significant decrease of the energy barrier ( D W ) to hemifission . The enlargement shows the two - PHD module ( fig .

These collars not only apply elastic stress ( mechanochemical effects ) but also , in a synergistic coordination with lipids , participate in the search for the optimal pathway of membrane rearrangements ( catalytic effects ) ( 7 ) . This nanoscale coordination between the geometry of the protein scaffold , concerted mem - brane wedging , and membrane deformations de - fine “ geometric catalysis , ” which yields a distinct low - energy pathway to hemifission ( fig . S10 ) . Without GTP , dynamin forms stable polymers that constrain highly curved membrane struc - tures , thereby effectively inhibiting topological transitions ( 29 ) , just as tighter substrate binding inhibits enzymatic catalysis . Hence our finding revises the general role of proteins as force drivers in membrane fission : Besides applying energy and stress , they can dynamically adapt to mem - brane deformations , providing a structural ratio - nale for protein regulatory and catalytic function in membrane remodeling .

A . de Groot , 2 Bisei Ohkawara , 1 † Carmen Reinhard , 1 Hendrik C . Korswagen , 2 Christof Niehrs 1 , 3 ‡ Casein kinase 1 ( CK1 ) members play key roles in numerous biological processes . They are considered “ rogue ” kinases , because their enzymatic activity appears unregulated . Contrary to this notion , we have identified the DEAD - box RNA helicase DDX3 as a regulator of the Wnt – b - catenin network , where it acts as a regulatory subunit of CK1 e : In a Wnt - dependent manner , DDX3 binds CK1 e and directly stimulates its kinase activity , and promotes phosphorylation of the scaffold protein dishevelled . DDX3 is required for Wnt – b - catenin signaling in mammalian cells and during Xenopus and Caenorhabditis elegans development . The results also suggest that the kinase - stimulatory function extends to other DDX and CK1 members , opening fresh perspectives for one of the longest - studied protein kinase families . W nt – b - catenin signaling plays a pivotal role in the development of multicel - lular organisms and in disease , notably cancer ( 1 , 2 ) . One important question in Wnt – b - catenin signaling concerns the casein kinase 1 ( CK1 ) family , members of which have both negative and positive functions in Wnt signaling ( 3 ) . CK1 kinases play diverse cellular roles from yeast to human — e . g . , in membrane transport , cell division , DNA repair , circadian rhythms , and nu - clear localization , as well as Wnt and Hedgehog signaling . Yet , despite their importance , whether and how these serine - threonine kinases are reg - ulated is poorly understood , and the prevailing view is that CK1 family members are constitu - tively active ( 3 – 5 ) . Among CK1 isoforms , CK1 e plays a critical and evolutionarily conserved role in Wnt – b - catenin signaling ( 6 – 8 ) . As a primary target , CK1 e phosphorylates and activates the scaffold protein dishevelled ( Dvl ) ( 9 , 10 ) , which binds components at the interface of Wnt re - ceptors and the b - catenin destruction complex ( 11 , 12 ) . Dvl phosphorylation by CK1 e promotes binding of the coeffector Frat , dissociation of PP2A from the b - catenin degradation complex , and stabilization of b - catenin ( 13 , 14 ) . We identified DDX3 in a genome - wide small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) screen for previously undescribed Wnt – b - catenin regulators in human embryonic kidney 239T ( HEK293T ) cells ( 15 , 16 ) ( information on materials and methods is avail - ableon Science online ) . DDX3belongstothefamily of adenosine 5´ - triphosphate ( ATP ) – dependent DEAD - boxRNAhelicases , for whichcellular func - tions and biological roles remain incompletely understood ( 17 ) . DDX3 is a multifunctional pro - tein involved in mRNA biogenesis processes and is implicated in cell cycle control , apoptosis , tumor - igenesis , and viral infection ( 18 ) . Knockdown of DDX3 by four independent siRNAs inhibited signaling in TOPFLASH reporter assays stimu - lated by Wnt3a but not by b - catenin ( fig . S1 , A and B ) . Cotransfection of Xenopus DDX3 rescued si DDX3 in a dose - dependent manner ( fig . S1C ) , excluding siRNA off - target effects . Wnt1 , Wnt3a , and Dvl1 signaling were inhibited by si DDX3 , whereas constitutively active LRP6 ( LRP6 D E1 - 4 ) and b - catenin were unaffected ( Fig . 1A ) . This epis - tasis is consistent with DDX3 acting at the level of Dvl , which is required for LRP6 activation . 1 Division of Molecular Embryology , DKFZ - ZMBH Alliance , Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum , Im Neuenheimer Feld 280 , D - 69120 Heidelberg , Germany . 2 Hubrecht Institute , Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences and University Medical Center Utrecht , Netherlands . 3 Institute of Molecular Biology , D - 55128 Mainz , Germany . * These authors contributed equally to this work . † Present address : Division of Neurogenetics , Center for Neu - rological Diseases and Cancer , Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine , Japan . ‡ Corresponding author .
