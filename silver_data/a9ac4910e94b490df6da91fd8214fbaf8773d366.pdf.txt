As in ordinary dew - etting , the evaporating ﬁlms initially break up through the nucleation of holes that perforate the ﬁlm , but the rapidly growing holes become unstable and form nonequilibrium patterns resembling ﬁngering patterns that arise when injecting air into a liquid between two closely spaced plates ( Hele – Shaw patterns ) . This is natural because the formation of holes in thin ﬁlms is similar to air injection into a polymer ﬁlm where the thermodynamic driving force of dewetting is the analogue of the applied pressure in the ﬂow measurement . The patterns formed in the rapidly dewetting and evaporating polymer ﬁlms become frozen into a stable glassy state after most of the solvent ( water ) has evaporated , leaving station - ary patterns that can be examined by atomic force microscopy and optical microscopy . Similar patterns have been observed in water ﬁlms evaporating from mica substrates , block copolymer ﬁlms , and modest hole ﬁngering has also been found in the dewetting of dry polymer ﬁlms . From these varied observations , we expect this dewetting - induced ﬁngering instability to occur generally when the dewetting rate and ﬁlm viscosity are sufﬁciently large . © 2002 Wiley Periodicals , Inc .

A single layer of polymer ﬁlm is applied on a solid sub - strate in many applications ( e . g . , lubricants on magnetic disks ) , whereas for others ( e . g . , paints and gas - barrier coatings ) , several polymer layers ( e . g . , top coat and primer ) are successively ap - plied by evaporating the solvent from a polymer solution . The evaporation of solvent from polymer ﬁlms can have a large inﬂuence on the resulting ﬁlm morphology . In blend ﬁlms , the evaporation pro - cess can lead to signiﬁcant changes in blend mis - * Contribution from the March 2002 Meeting of the Amer - ican Physical Society—Division of Polymer Physics , Indianap - olis , Indiana †Certain commercial instruments and materials are iden - tiﬁed in this article to adequately describe the procedure .

Although there have been numerous studies of the dewetting of uniform polymer ﬁlms spun - cast on nearly homogeneous substrates , 12 – 23 the in - vestigation of ﬁlms that dewet in the course of drying is limited . Previous studies on evaporating water ﬁlms on mica substrates indicate the for - mation of holes as in ordinary dewetting , but the boundary of the rapidly growing holes breaks up into ﬁngering patterns that resemble nonequilib - rium crystallization patterns 8 – 12 and Hele – Shaw ﬂow patterns 24 , 25 . ( an example of the Hele – Shaw pattern formation is considered subsequently ) . In this article , we show that similar nonequilibrium growth patterns are exhibited in evaporating polymer solution ﬁlms dewetting from the sub - strate on which they are cast . We speciﬁcally con - sider the dewetting of a thin hydrophilic polymer [ poly ( acrylic acid ) ( PAA ) ] solution ﬁlm cast on a hydrophobic [ polystyrene ( PS ) ﬁlm ] substrate . We characterize the morphology of the resulting dew - etted ﬁlm by atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) . To establish that the top layer in the dewetted poly - mer ﬁlm is the PAA component and that the un - derlayer is the PS component , water was used to dissolve the top layer while keeping the PS un - derlayer intact . Fingering patterns have been ob - served in rapidly evaporating water ﬁlms , 11 and our work demonstrates that a similar phenome - non arises in cast polymer ﬁlms where the struc - ture becomes “frozen” in the course of solvent evaporation from the ﬁlm . The dewetting process is too rapid to allow us to conduct a kinetic study of this pattern formation . EXPERIMENTAL The hydrophobic substrates were prepared by spin - casting PS [ Acros Organics , mass - average molecular mass ( M w ) : 250 , 000 , glass - transition temperature ( T g ) : 104 °C ] solution ( toluene sol - vent ) onto acetone - cleaned silicon wafers . An aqueous solution of PAA ( Aldrich , M w (cid:1) 450 , 000 , T g (cid:1) 106 °C ) was then cast on these PS sub - strates . Air - drying of the PS ﬁlms for 10 min was deemed adequate to remove most of the residual solvent from the PS coating . Although we did not anneal the samples , the ﬁlms were quite glassy at room temperature ; therefore , we expected resid - ual solvent to have a minimal effect on our mea - surements . The PS substrate should be consid - ered a solidlike , highly energetically unfavorable substrate for PAA whose topography can be ma - nipulated by spin - casting conditions . The speed of spin - casting was maintained at 2000 rpm for 30 s . To minimize the effect of the silicon substrate on the dewetting morphologies , we considered a high PS concentration ( 8 . 0 % mass fraction ) and ob - tained thick PS ﬁlms . Two different solution con - centrations of PAA , 1 . 0 and 0 . 1 % mass fraction , were used to vary the thickness of the PAA layer . Thickness of the cast ﬁlms was measured by AFM . For this application , the ﬁlm on the silicon was scratched with a knife to expose the bare silicon substrate . The average step height from the ﬁlm surface to the surface of the substrate was used as an estimate of the ﬁlm thickness . The thicknesses of the PAA ﬁlms cast from 1 . 0 and 0 . 1 % mass fraction solutions were 32 (cid:2) 2 and 10 (cid:2) 1 nm , respectively . The results reported here are the averages of three measurements . The morphology and dewetting pattern of the cast ﬁlms were imaged with a Dimension 3100 ( Digital Instruments ) scanning probe microscope in tapping mode under ambient conditions . Man - ufacturers’ values for the tip radius and spring constant for the silicon cantilever probe were in the ranges of 5 – 10 nm and 20 – 100 N / m , respec - tively . Topographic and phase images were re - corded simultaneously with a resonance fre - quency of approximately 300 kHz for the probe oscillation , a scan rate of 1 Hz , and a free - oscilla - tion amplitude of 60 (cid:2) 5 nm . The measurements used a set - point ratio in the range of 0 . 6 – 0 . 8 . RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Figure 1 ( A ) portrays topographic ( left ) and phase ( right ) images of a PAA ﬁlm cast on a PS sub - strate . The image ( scan dimension , 2 . 5 (cid:3) 2 . 5 (cid:1) m ) 2826 GU ET AL . was obtained immediately after ﬁlm casting and ﬁlm drying , and the patterns apparently reveal no appreciable evolution of structure at later times . The sample in this ﬁgure was prepared by spin - casting 8 . 0 % mass fraction PS in toluene on an acetone - cleaned silicon wafer with 0 . 1 % mass fraction PAA for the top layer . We observe iso - lated “dense branching” or “seaweed” ﬁngering patterns that are characteristic of a variety of nonequilibrium pattern - formation processes such as nonequilibrium crystal growth , growth of bac - terial colonies , and ﬂuid ﬁngering in multiphase systems . 26 – 28 Note the tendency of the branches of the growing front to split as the pattern devel - ops , which is a characteristic of seaweed growth . The size of the ﬁngering pattern varies within the sample . The topographic image and its corre - sponding height proﬁle [ Fig . 1 ( B ) ] suggest that the interior region of the pattern is lower than the exterior ﬂat region , whereas the ﬁngers and the rim of the pattern are elevated . In addition to the localized regions of dewetting in Figure 1 , we occasionally observed patches in which the dewetting patterns impinge on each other . Figure 2 depicts topographic ( left ) and phase ( right ) images of another location of an as - prepared PS - PAA bilayer . Apparently , there are variations in the density of heterogeneities on the PS substrate that initiate ﬁlm dewetting . Note the tendency of the dewetting patterns to deform when they strongly interact , another characteristic feature of this kind of nonequilib - rium growth pattern as studied in the context of crystallization 29 and ordinary dewetting of uni - form polymer ﬁlms . 30 The interpretation of the pattern formation described previously requires that the elevated rims are PAA , whereas the de - pressions should reach down nearly to the PS substrate ( a very thin layer of the dewetting ﬂuid can sometimes remain on the “dry” regions ) . We attempted to identify the chemical nature of the “dry regions” by hydrolyzing the PAA layer and Figure 1 .

Although at (cid:4) 90 % RH , the mobility of the PAA apparently became large enough for the PS layer to become exposed ( as evidenced by a drop in the frictional force of the depressed regions ) . These results support our in - terpretation that the elevated dewetted regions are PAA and that the dewetted regions extend down close to the PS substrate . The patterns in Figures 1 and 2 have a strong resemblance to water - ﬁlm evaporation pat - terns , 9 , 10 but the polymer - ﬁlm patterns become “frozen” in form once the ﬁlm has dried sufﬁ - ciently . This greatly facilitates the investigation of the patterns by AFM and other microscopy methods , but kinetic studies are not readily per - formed because of the rapid nature of the pattern formation . Previous work has emphasized that there is a similarity of this kind of pattern forma - tion to nonequilibrium crystallization growth pat - terns 12 , 41 where seaweed patterns have been ob - served , but here we draw analogy to the problem of viscous ﬁngering where we think there is a closer physical relation to our observations . Seaweed growth patterns are characteristi - cally found when a low - viscosity ﬂuid is injected into a high - viscosity medium . Disorder ( heteroge - neity ) tends to enhance the branching of such ﬁngers . 39 A ﬁlmlike geometry exists when the viscous ﬂuid is conﬁned between two plates with a narrow gap between them . To make our compar - ison concrete , we demonstrate in Figure 3 an op - tical micrograph of Hele – Shaw patterns 25 , 42 gen - erated by injecting air into deionized water con - ﬁned between glass plates having a 50 (cid:1) m separation . The ﬁeld of view corresponds to 9 . 9 (cid:3) 8 . 3 cm , resulting in large patterns . Successive contours indicate the position of the air – water front as it spreads into the water matrix . Initially the air boundary has a round shape governed by surface tension , but the moving front breaks up into ﬁngers that split as they grow to form a branched viscous ﬁngering pattern . The ﬁngering instability in thin evaporating ﬁlms has been de - scribed by Iyushnin et al . 10 who also emphasize the similarity of the ﬁngering instability to a Ray - leigh instability of a ﬂuid thread corresponding to Figure 2 .

We include Figure 3 as a point of reference in our discussion of dewetting . Next , we summarize our interpretation of dew - etting in evaporating polymer solution ﬁlms as a closely analogous process . Holes are formed in the PAA layer by nucleation ( homogeneous nucle - ation from surface undulation and heterogeneous nucleation from impurities in the ﬁlm and on the PS substrate ) , and these holes are normally cir - cular in the early stages of dewetting . The initial formation of holes in thin ﬁlm is similar to the injection of air into a highly viscous ﬂuid conﬁned to near two dimensions . At a late stage of dewet - ting , there is a strong tendency for the holes to coalesce , and this coalescence process largely de - termines the morphology of the late - stage dewet - ting pattern . 43 When the rims of growing holes eventually contact each other , the opposing faces ﬂatten out because of increased viscous resistance encountered by the polymer , and a thin liquid ribbon is formed between neighboring holes by a merger of these rims . In late - stage dewetting , the branches grow from the rim by consecutive split - ting of the leading tips as they grow away from the center of the pattern . Small droplets are vis - ible on the tips of some branches in Figure 1 ( A ) , especially in the phase image . These droplets rep - resent the termination points of the viscous ﬁn - gers . This observation is consistent with other studies for high - molecular - weight PS on nonwet - ting substrates , which have shown that ﬁngers develop from the rim and grow radially , and the ﬁngers eventually pinch off leaving a trail of drops from the resulting Rayleigh instability . 44 , 45 Late - stage dewetting of PAA on PS ﬁlm was reached while the solvent was evaporating from the spun - cast ﬁlm . This is supported by observa - tion of similar dewetting patterns when the sam - ple was either annealed at 100 °C for 4 h or under ambient conditions for 24 h ( the results are not shown ) . Because PAA has a T g of 106 °C and is glassy when it is dry at ambient temperature , the growth of the ﬁngers becomes frozen when the solvent ( water ) has sufﬁciently evaporated . Sim - ilarly , the role of external humidity on the ﬁlm dewetting structure was noticed for volatile spin - coated dewetting collagen solution ﬁlms , 39 where the balance between the dewetting process ( het - erogeneous nucleation or spinodal dewetting ) and ﬁlm thinning because of solvent evaporation strongly inﬂuences the dewetting morphology . AFM images of thicker ﬁlms made from 1 . 0 % mass fraction PAA solutions cast on PS lead to patterns of even greater complexity , as illustrated in Figure 4 . A dust particle in the center of the pattern serves as the nuclei for the dewetting process , resulting in a height variation in the radial direction . Compared with the ﬁngering structure of the thin ﬁlm ( 0 . 1 % mass fraction PAA spun - cast on PS ) shown in Figure 1 , this isolated dewetting pattern has greater branching density . With an increase in the viscosity of the evaporat - ing concentrated PAA solution , the velocity of hole growth is much slower , but the mismatch between the ﬂuid viscosity of the ﬁlm and the growing holes enhances the instability responsi - ble for the ﬂow pattern , again as in the Hele – Shaw measurements . The highly branched na - ture of the growth patterns is particularly strik - ing in thick ﬁlms and highly viscous casting solutions where the resulting viscous ﬁngers be - Figure 3 .

Image dimension is 9 . 9 (cid:3) 8 . 3 cm . The image is blurry because of the difﬁculty in achieving contrast in the measurements ( these are new measurements provided for us by R . Ennis and P . Palffy - Muhoray of Kent State University ) .

Fractal patterns having a similar fractal dimension to diffusion - limited ag - gregation have been shown to occur in Hele – Shaw pattern formation when the ﬂuid spreads into a porous ( i . e . , heterogeneous ) medium . 46 – 48 The branching structure of the pattern is characteris - tically inﬂuenced by the viscoelasticity of the ﬂuid in the Hele – Shaw ﬂows , 49 , 50 and the same is likely true for pattern formation in evaporating polymer solution ﬁlms . Figure 4 ( b ) depicts an AFM image of a fractal dewetting pattern at high magniﬁcation . Similar fractal topographical patterns in thin ﬁlms have been seen in block copolymer ﬁlms 51 where dust particles seem to nucleate the pat - terns . Jagged dewetting holes forming in initially smooth polymer spun - cast ﬁlms ( little solvent evaporation occurs in the dewetting process in this case ) have been attributed by Reiter 30 to the instability of the hole rim ; therefore , this type of instability is not limited to evaporating ﬁlms . Our results for evaporating polymer solution ﬁlms and the suggested analogy with Hele – Shaw ﬂows sug - gest that this type of ﬂow instability should be general for rapidly dewetting viscous ﬁlms . Rapid evaporating polymer ﬁlms are particularly favor - able for observing such patterns because dewet - ting tends to occur in relatively thick ﬁlms , and hole - growth formation is often rapid .
