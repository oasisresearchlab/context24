Two coﬁlin isoforms , muscle - type ( M - CF ) and nonmuscle - type ( NM - CF ) encoded by di(cid:128)erent genes , exist in mammals ; in the adult , the former is predominantly expressed in muscle tissues , while the latter is distributed in various non - muscle tissues ( Ono et al . , 1994 ) . In this study , we examined coﬁlin isoform expression during skeletal and cardiac muscle development in mice using cDNA probes and antibodies which distinguish the isoforms . We found that the expression of M - CF was initiated in terminally di(cid:128)erentiated myogenic cells in both the myotome and limb buds . In myogenic cell cultures , its expression occurred coupled with myotube formation . NM - CF was expressed in developing skeletal and cardiac muscles but disappeared from skeletal muscle during postnatal development , while its expression persisted in the heart , even in adult mice . A similar situation was observed in the heart of other mammals . Thus , it is likely that the both coﬁlin isoforms are involved in the regulation of actin assembly during myoﬁbrillogenesis . Only M - CF could be involved in actin dynamics in mature skeletal muscle , while both isoforms could be in the mature heart . Introduction Assembly of actin ﬁlaments and their precise align - ment into sarcomeric structures are a major process of myoﬁbrillogenesis during the development of striated muscles . In developing striated muscle cells , actin exists as a mixture of an unpolymerized pool of monomeric actin and ﬁlamentous actin ( Shimizu and Obinata , 1986 ) . The latter is mostly bundled in premyoﬁbrils ( Dabiri et al . , 1997 ) or cortical ﬁlaments beneath the plasma membrane ( Fischman , 1986 ) . As muscle develops , the majority of actin is organized into thin actin ﬁlaments in the sarcomeric structures of myoﬁbrils . Our previous investigations have dem - onstrated that in young myogenic cells , di(cid:128)erent types of G - actin - binding proteins exist in the cytoplasm to inhibit actin polymerization . They are ADF ( actin depolymerizing factor ) , coﬁlin , proﬁlin , and thymosin b ( Abe and Obinata , 1989 ; Abe et al . , 1989 ; Ohshima et al . , 1989 ; Nagaoka et al . , 1996 ) . During develop - ment , the levels of these proteins decrease ( Nagaoka et al . , 1996 ) and their activity may be regulated ( Obinata , 1993 ; Morgan et al . , 1993 ) , and thereby , actin polymerization could be accelerated . On the other hand , redistribution of preexisting actin ﬁlament bundles , partially at least , may be indispensable for the precise alignment of actin in a striated pattern . In our previous investigation , actin ﬁlaments in cultured skeletal muscle cells were drastically reorganized , when coﬁlin concentration in the cytoplasm was increased by microinjection of the puriﬁed protein ( Nagaoka et al . , 1995 ) or by transfection of the cDNA ( Ono et al . , 1996 ) , although in the case of the cDNA transfection , the exogenous coﬁlin became activated in a stimulus - dependent manner , because the activity of coﬁlin could be easily suppressed in the cytoplasm by phosphorylation ( Agnew et al . , 1995 ) or some other mechanism ( Nagaoka et al . , 1995 ) . Thus , it is likely that coﬁlin is deeply involved in this event ( Obinata et al . , 1997 ) . ADF ( Bamburg et al . , 1980 ) and coﬁlin ( Nishida et al . , 1984 ) are now categorized in the same protein family , ADF / coﬁlin family ( Moon and Drubin , 1995 ) because of their basically similar functional character - istics ( Nishida et al . , 1984 ; Hayden et al . , 1993 ) , high sequence homology and common functional domains ( Abe et al . , 1990 ; Adams et al . , 1990 ; Agnew et al . , 1995 ; Moriyama et al . , 1996 ) . Evidence has recently accumulated to indicate that members of the ADF / coﬁlin family are widely distributed among eukaryotic organisms and plays a critical role in actin ﬁlament dynamics in a variety of cells ( for review , Bamburg , 1999 ) . They bind to G - as well as F - actin at a stoichiometry of 1 to 1 and enhance turnover of actin * To whom correspondence should be addressed : Tel . : + 81 43 290 2804 ; Fax : + 81 43 290 2807 ; E - mail : tobinata @ bio . s . chiba - u . ac . jp Journal of Muscle Research and Cell Motility 21 : 49 – 57 , 2000 . 49 (cid:211) 2000 Kluwer Academic Publishers . Printed in the Netherlands . monomeric units within actin ﬁlaments by severing F - actin ( Nishida et al . , 1984 ; Hayden et al . , 1993 ) , regulating the rate constants of depolymerization and polymerization at the ﬁlament ends ( Carlier et al . , 1997 ) , and changing the twists of the ﬁlaments ( McGough et al . , 1997 ) . Although both ADF and coﬁlin are present in developing muscle ( Bamburg et al . , 1987 ; Abe and Obinata , 1989 ; Abe et al . , 1989 ) , ADF expression is down - regulated as muscle develops , while coﬁlin ex - pression persists through muscle development although the level decreases somewhat ( Nagaoka et al . , 1996 ) and increases markedly under muscle degenerating conditions ( Shinagawa et al . , 1993 ; Hayakawa et al . , 1993 ; Nagaoka et al . , 1996 ) . Therefore , coﬁlin may be more important as a regulator for actin dynamics than ADF during muscle morphogenesis and muscle degen - eration . We previously discovered a muscle - speciﬁc coﬁlin isoform ( M - CF ) in mammals ( Ono et al . , 1994 ) . M - CF is quite homologous to chicken coﬁlin , the only coﬁlin isoform present in chicken , as judged by sequence homology ; they exhibit 96 % identity in amino acid sequence , while M - CF and nonmuscle - type coﬁlin ( NM - CF ) show only 81 % identity . According to northern blot analysis , NM - CF , which was originally discovered in porcine brain , is expressed in a variety of tissues except skeletal muscle , while M - CF is predom - inantly expressed in muscle tissues including skeletal , cardiac and smooth muscles ( Ono et al . , 1994 ) . The di(cid:128)erential expression of the coﬁlin isoforms in partic - ular tissues suggests their specialized roles in the regulation of certain types of actin cytoskeleton . It is a matter of particular interest as to whether M - CF plays any speciﬁc role during muscle morphogenesis , especially during myoﬁbrillogenesis . In the case of a nematode , Caenorhabditis elegans , two ADF / coﬁlin proteins are generated from a single gene ( McKim et al . , 1994 ) . They are functionally distinct and one of them is speciﬁcally required for the proper assembly of actin into myoﬁbrils ( Ono and Benian , 1998 ; Ono et al . , 1999 ) . In this study , with the aim of clarifying how the two mammalian coﬁlin isoforms are involved in the regu - lation of actin assembly during muscle development , we investigated their expression patterns during the development of mouse muscle tissues . The results showed that M - CF becomes detectable in myogenic cells at early developmental stages , but NM - CF is also expressed in young fetal skeletal muscles . During postnatal development , however , M - CF becomes the only isoform in skeletal muscle . In addition , in culture , M - CF was detectable only in myotubes , but not in myoblasts . These results indicate that coﬁlin can be a regulator of thin actin ﬁlament organization during myoﬁbrillogenesis and that both NM - CF and M - CF play important roles in the early process of muscle development , but M - CF becomes particularly impor - tant at later stages . Materials and methods Whole - mount in situ hybridization Digoxigenin - 11 - UTP - labeled single strand RNA probes were prepared using a DIG RNA labeling kit ( Roche Diagnostics , Mannheim , Germany ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . The cDNAs encoding M - CF ( Ono et al . , 1994 ) and NM - CF ( Moriyama et al . , 1990 ) were used to generate antisense and sense probes . Mouse troponin T cDNA which encodes fast skeletal muscle isoform FE2e17 ( Wang et al . , 1997 ) was cloned from a k ZAPII cDNA library of C2 myotubes ( Matsumoto et al . , 1997 ) . Mouse myogenin cDNA has been described ( Fujisawa - Sehara et al . , 1990 ) . Short fragments of cDNAs containing their coding regions were subcloned and these constructs were used as templates for speciﬁc probes . Hybridiza - tion was performed as described previously ( Tonegawa et al . , 1997 ) . Hybridized embryos were embedded in para(cid:129)n wax after dehydration with ethanol and xylene . Serial sections of 10 l m thickness were pre - pared and mounted in Entellan ( Merck KGaA , Darmstadt , Germany ) . Northern blotting The cDNA probes used were the 0 . 5 kb fragments containing the coding region of mouse NM - CF or M - CF . Total RNA was prepared by a rapid one - step method ( Chomczynski and Sacchi , 1987 ) . 10 l g of RNA for each lane was separated on 1 % agarose - formalde - hyde gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes . Hybridization was performed by the procedure of Thomas ( 1980 ) , with the probes labeled with 32 P by the method of Feinberg and Vogelstein ( 1983 ) . The membrane was ﬁnally washed in 0 . 2 (cid:2) SSC ( 1 (cid:2) SSC = 150 mM NaCl , 25 mM trisodium citrate ) containing 0 . 1 % SDS at 55 (cid:14) C . Antibodies The monoclonal antibody ( MCF1 ) speciﬁc for M - CF was prepared in rat by using a synthetic peptide of the partial M - CF sequence as an immunogen ; name - ly , WQVNGLDDIKDRS ( residues 135 – 147 of M - CF sequence ) was conjugated with keyhole limpet hemocyanin ( Calbiochem , La Jolla , CA ) using N - ( m - maleimidobenzoyloxy ) succimide ( MBS ) as a cross - linking reagent . Rabbit anti - serum to NM - CF ( anti - NMCF ) was prepared with synthetic peptides KKNIILEEGKE and LQANCYEEVK , residues 44 – 54 and 135 – 144 of NM - CF sequence , respectively , as immunogens . They were conjugated with hemocyanin as described above when used as immunogens . The speciﬁcity of the antibodies was established by immunoblotting combined with SDS - PAGE ( Figure 6 ) . Monoclonal antibody to coﬁlin ( MAB22 ) has been described ( Abe et al . , 1989 ) . Alkaline phospha - 50 tase ( AP ) - labeled goat anti - mouse IgG ( GAM ) and AP - labeled goat anti - rabbit IgG ( GARb ) were pur - chased from Bio - Rad ( Richmond , CA ) . AP - labeled goat anti - rat IgG ( GARt ) was from Chemicon ( Temecula , CA ) . Fluorescein ( FITC ) - labeled GARt and tetramethylrhodamine ( TRITC ) - labeled donkey anti - rabbit IgG ( DARb ) were from Tago ( Burlingame , California ) . Gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting Pieces of mouse brain or embryonic muscles were dissolved in an SDS sample bu(cid:128)er ( 4 % SDS , 4 % 2 - mercaptoethanol , 40 mM sodium - phosphate bu(cid:128)er , pH 7 . 0 , 10 % glycerol ) ; the tissues were sonicated in 8 volumes of the SDS - sample bu(cid:128)er , boiled for 3 min , and the extracts were taken after centrifugation . Recombinant NM - CF and M - CF were prepared using an E . coli expression vector pET - 3d with the cDNAs encoding respective proteins ( Moriyama et al . , 1990 ; Ono et al . , 1994 ) as described previously ( Kusano et al . , 1999 ) . SDS - PAGE was performed with 13 . 5 % gel in a discontinuous Tris – glycine bu(cid:128)er system ( Laemmli , 1970 ) . The proteins were trans - ferred electrophoretically from SDS - polyacrylamide gels to nitrocellulose membrane in a solution con - taining 25 % ethanol , 20 mM Tris – HCl , 150 mM glycine , pH 8 . 3 for 1 h according to Towbin et al . ( 1979 ) . The nitrocellulose membrane was treated with 5 % skim milk and then incubated with antibodies to coﬁlin for 1 h at room temperature , followed by treatment with AP - labeled 2nd antibodies for 1 h at room temperature . After the immunoreaction , the membrane was washed with 0 . 1 M NaCl , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 5 . The AP - labeled antibodies bound to the membrane were detected by incubating with a mixture of 5 - bromo - 4 - chloro - 3 - indolylphosphate p - toluidine salt ( BCIP ) and nitroblue tetrazolium chloride ( NBT ) . Cell culture and ﬂuorescence microscopy C2 cells ( Ya(cid:128)e and Saxel , 1977 ) were cultured on glass coverslips and maintained for about 48 h after plating in DMEM containing 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) in a humidiﬁed atmosphere with 5 % CO 2 and 95 % air at 37 (cid:14) C . Cells were ﬁxed with 4 % paraformaldehyde in PBS ( 0 . 15 M NaCl and 10 mM sodium phosphate , pH 7 . 0 ) for 20 min on ice , and further ﬁxed and permeabil - ized with 100 % methanol for additional 5 min at (cid:255) 20 (cid:14) C . They were then exposed to anti - coﬁlin antibod - ies , followed by staining with FITC - labeled GARt or TRITC - labeled DARb . The cultures were washed tho - roughly with PBS and mounted with 50 % glycerol containing 75 mM KCl , 10 mg / ml p - phenylenediamine and 50 mM sodium carbonate bu(cid:128)er , pH 8 . 0 . The specimens were examined under a Zeiss epiﬂuorescence microscope . Results Northern blot analysis Expression of the two coﬁlin isoforms , M - CF and NM - CF , during development of mouse skeletal and cardiac muscles was examined by northern blotting by using the cDNA probes speciﬁc for the respective coﬁlin isoforms . When the RNA extracted from developing skeletal muscle was examined with the cDNA probe for mouse NM - CF , mRNA of 1 . 4 kb was detected , while two species of mRNAs of 1 . 8 and 3 kb were detected by using M - CF cDNA as a probe ( Figure 1A ) . The two transcripts for M - CF are generated from a single gene by selective usage of two polyadenylation signals ( Ono et al . , 1994 ) and therefore they di(cid:128)er only in the 3 0 - noncoding sequence and share the same open reading frame . The mRNAs encoding M - CF and NM - CF were detected at almost the same level in mouse thigh muscle at the newborn stage , but the amount of NM - CF mRNA decreased remarkably after birth . Thus , the Fig . 1 . Change in the expression of muscle - type coﬁlin ( M - CF ) and nonmuscle - type coﬁlin ( NM - CF ) during development of mouse thigh muscle . ( A ) Total RNA ( 10 l g ) extracted from newborn ( a ) , 7 - day postnatal ( b ) , and 2 - month postnatal ( c ) mouse skeletal muscles was examined by northern blotting with the cDNA probes speciﬁc for NM - CF or M - CF . Arrowheads indicate M - CF mRNAs of 3 . 0 and 1 . 8 kb as marked . The positions of 28 and 18 S ribosomal RNAs are also indicated . ( B ) The relative proportions of the messages for NM - CF or M - CF were estimated by densitometry . Change in the proportion of 3 . 0 and 1 . 8 kb mRNAs of M - CF was also demonstrated . a , newborn ; b , 7 - day postnatal ; c , 2 - month postnatal . 51 proportion of the message for M - CF increased signif - icantly during postnatal development , and in adult , only the message for M - CF was detectable . The proportion of the M - CF mRNAs of 1 . 8 and 3 . 0 kb also changed during skeletal muscle development ; in embryonic ( data not shown ) and neonatal stages , the mRNA of 1 . 8 kb was predominant in skeletal muscle , but the proportion of the mRNA of 3 . 0 kb increased gradually during muscle development ( Figure 1B ) . In the case of cardiac muscle , however , the messages for both M - CF and NM - CF were detected not only in embryonic stages but also in adult ( Figure 2 ) . The amount of total coﬁlin messages decreased in adult heart , but about 50 % of the total message was constituted by NM - CF mRNA . The 3 . 0 kb mRNA of M - CF was scarcely detectable in heart through all developmental stages . Therefore , the generation of the mRNA of 3 . 0 kb seems to be a phenomenon characteristic of skeletal muscle . 2D - PAGE analysis of coﬁlin isoform expression in striated muscles We examined further the types of coﬁlin expressed in developing skeletal and cardiac muscles by two - dimen - sional ( 2D ) electrophoresis ( Figure 3 ) . Two coﬁlin isoforms , M - CF and NM - CF , which were distinguish - able by di(cid:128)erences in pI as well as antigenicity , were detected in both skeletal and cardiac muscles of neonatal mice ; in the neonatal skeletal muscle , the two coﬁlins were detectable at almost the same amounts , while in the neonatal cardiac muscle , NM - CF was more abundant ( Figure 3a , b ) . NM - CF was detected in adult mouse cardiac muscle , although the amount was much smaller than in neonatal mice ( Figure 3c ) . In adult skeletal muscle , NM - CF was not detected ( Figure 3d ) . NM - CF was also detectable in heart of hamster and pig ( Figure 3e , h ) , but not in skeletal muscle ( Figure 3f ) . Detection of M - CF message in embryos by in situ hybridization Gene expression of M - CF at an early developmental stage was examined with mouse embryos at 10 . 5 days p . c . by in situ hybridization methods . When the whole mouse embryos were hybridized with M - CF - speciﬁc probes , the message of M - CF was detected in the medial side of somites at a high level ( marked by arrowheads ) , but in the other regions around somites , the message was at a much lower level ( Figure 4a , d ) . In the regions where the M - CF message was detected , the expression of myogenin ( Figure 4b , e ) and troponin T ( Figure 4c , f ) were also clearly detected . Myogenin is a myogenic regulatory factor which is expressed exclusively in myotomes ( Sassoon et al . , 1989 ) and troponin T is a muscle structural protein which is expressed speciﬁcally in terminally di(cid:128)erentiated muscle cells . The regions where all three genes were expressed corresponded to the medial side of somites , and elongated cells were observed in these regions . Therefore , it is likely that somites have already been sub - divided into myotomes at the medial side in this embryo and muscle cells have been formed in this region . We conclude that M - CF was expressed at a high level in these myotomal myogenic regions and that up - regulation of M - CF gene expression is coupled with the early process of muscle cell di(cid:128)erentiation . The message for M - CF was also detected in the limb buds of mouse embryos at 13 days p . c . ( Figure 5a , marked by arrowheads ) . The regions where M - CF Fig . 2 . Northern blot analysis of coﬁlin isoform expression during development of mouse cardiac muscle . Northern blot analysis of total RNA ( 10 l g ) extracted from the ventricular region of heart was performed using the cDNA probes speciﬁc for NM - CF and M - CF as shown in the ﬁgures . Arrowheads indicate mRNAs of 3 . 0 and 1 . 8 kb as marked . The positions of 28 and 18 S ribosomal RNAs are also indicated . a , 13 - day embryo ; b , 15 - day embryo ; c , newborn ; d , 7 - day postnatal ; e , 2 - month old . Fig . 3 . Analysis of coﬁlin isoforms expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscles by two - dimensional electrophoresis . Whole lysates of skeletal and cardiac muscles were electrophoresed on two - dimensional gels , and then coﬁlin was detected by means of immunoblotting with MAB22 . The positions of M - CF and NM - CF were marked as M and NM , respectively . a , mouse neonatal heart ; b , mouse neonatal skeletal muscle ; c , adult mouse cardiac muscle ; d , adult mouse skeletal muscle ; e , adult hamster cardiac muscle ; f , adult hamster skeletal muscle ; g , adult hamster liver ; h , adult porcine heart . 52 message was detected are regarded as places where developing limb muscle masses existed because again , the messages for myogenin and troponin T were clearly detected in these regions ( Figure 5b , c ) . We conclude that M - CF expression is also initiated in the early process of limb muscle development . Expression of M - CF in cultured myogenic cells In order to examine precisely the expression of the two coﬁlin isoforms during muscle cell di(cid:128)erentiation at a cellular level , we prepared the antibodies which distin - guish the two coﬁlin isoforms – rat monoclonal anti - body ( MCF1 ) to M - CF and rabbit polyclonal antibody to NM - CF . The speciﬁcity of these antibodies was conﬁrmed by immunoblotting as shown in Figure 6 . These antibodies reacted only with one coﬁlin band in the whole protein extracts from mouse skeletal muscle or brain and recognized speciﬁcally either recombinant M - CF or NM - CF . When mouse C2 myoblasts main - tained in a growth medium were treated with these two antibodies , anti - NM - CF antibody stained the mononu - cleated myoblasts brightly but the majority of myoblasts were scarcely stained by the antibody speciﬁc for M - CF ( Figure 7a , b ) . In contrast , when multinucleated myo - tubes were formed in a di(cid:128)erentiation medium , they were positively stained with both antibodies ( Figure 7c , d ) . Their staining patterns scarcely di(cid:128)ered ; both coﬁlins were mostly detected in myotubes in a di(cid:128)use pattern , although when myotubes were treated with dimethyl - sulfoxicide ( DMSO ) , both of them were transported into nuclei to form coﬁlin - actin rods as previously described Fig . 4 . Detection of M - CF mRNA in the myotome region of mouse embryo by means of in situ hybridization . Mouse embryos at 10 . 5 days p . c . were reacted with the RNA probes for M - CF ( a , d ) , myogenin ( b , e ) and troponin - T ( c , f ) and then , transverse ( a , b , c ) and frontal sections ( d , e , f ) were prepared . In d , e and f , the medial side is in the bottom . Arrowheads denote the myotome regions where the M - CF message was concentrated . 53 ( Nishida et al . , 1987 ) . These results indicate that the onset of M - CF expression is coupled with muscle cell di(cid:128)erentiation and both NM - and M - CFs are involved in the regulation of actin assembly in myotubes at the early phase of myoﬁbrillogenesis , while at later stages , M - CF becomes essential for muscle cells . Discussion We have previously demonstrated that coﬁlin is involved in the regulation of actin assembly in developing muscle cells ( Abe et al . , 1989 ; Nagaoka et al . , 1995 , 1996 ) . Since two coﬁlin isoforms , M - CF and NM - CF , exist in mammals ( Ono et al . , 1994 ) , we were interested in how the two coﬁlin isoforms are involved in actin ﬁlament organization in developing muscle tissues . The coﬁlin isoform expression during skeletal and cardiac muscle development in mice was examined by using cDNA probes and antibodies which distinguish the isoforms . We found that the expression of M - CF was initiated in the myogenic regions in myotomes and limb buds . We observed that coﬁlin mRNA was also highly concen - trated in myotome regions of chicken embryos ( Mohri et al . , unpublished ) . The messages for a myogenic factor , myogenin , and a muscle structural protein , troponin T , were detectable in the regions where the message for M - CF was detected . The expression of M - CF in cultured myogenic cells was detected only in terminally di(cid:128)erentiated myotubes . Therefore , the initi - ation of M - CF gene expression appears coupled with terminal di(cid:128)erentiation of skeletal muscle . However , NM - CF is also expressed in developing muscle cells . Both isoforms may be similarly involved in actin dynamics during muscle development , but M - CF may become indispensable in mature skeletal muscle . If we can imagine a situation where M - CF gene is mutated or deleted , the e(cid:128)ect would appear only in adult skeletal muscle . In the case of cardiac muscle , both isoforms were detectable even in adult . The expression of dual coﬁlin isoforms may be advantageous for minimizing damage in the heart in case that one coﬁlin gene is mutated . It has been reported that in a nematode , C . elegans , two isoforms of coﬁlin / ADF are generated from a single gene ( McKim et al . , 1994 ) and that they are functionally Fig . 5 . Detection of M - CF mRNA in the myogenic regions in the fore limb buds of mouse embryo by means of in situ hybridization . A whole mouse embryo at 13 days p . c . was reacted with the RNA probes for M - CF ( a ) , myogenin ( b ) and troponin - T ( c ) . Arrowheads denote the myogenic regions where the M - CF message is concentrated . Fig . 6 . Speciﬁcity of antibodies to NM - CF and M - CF as examined by immunoblotting . In ( A ) , puriﬁed recombinant NM - CF ( NM ) and M - CF ( M ) and in ( B ) , the whole protein extracts from mouse leg muscle ( SkM ) and brain ( Br ) were electrophoresed on SDS - polyacrylamide gels . One lane of each specimen , marked CBB , was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue to demonstrate the protein bands . The others were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose paper , and treated with the polyclonal antibody to NM - CF ( anti - NM - CF ) , the monoclonal antibody to M - CF ( anti - M - CF ) , MCF1 , or the mono - clonal antibody to chicken coﬁlin ( MAB22 ) , followed by treatment with alkaline phosphatase - conjugated GAM or GARt . Anti - NM - CF reacted positively with the puriﬁed recombinant NM - CF and the crude brain extract , giving only one band corresponding to coﬁlin which was also recognized by previously established anti - coﬁlin antibody ( MAB22 ) . Anti - M - CF ( MCF1 ) showed positive reaction with recom - binant M - CF and the crude muscle extract , giving only one band corresponding to coﬁlin . 54 distinct from each other ( Ono et al . , 1999 ) . In our preliminary investigations , we observed that M - CF and NM - CF show quite similar functional activity in the e(cid:128)ects on actin assembly in an in vitro system , although the latter exhibited slightly higher actin depolymerizing activity under alkaline pH conditions ( Akutsu et al . , unpublished ) . In embryonic skeletal muscle , cytoskeletal b - and c - actins exist together with sarcomeric a - actin ( Shimizu and Obinata , 1980 ) , but up to now no deﬁnitive data has been presented to indicate that M - CF and NM - CF interact di(cid:128)erentially with actin iso - forms . It is obvious that the mammalian coﬁlin isoforms are quite di(cid:128)erent from the isoforms in a nematode coﬁlin / ADF protein in terms of function , and it is likely that the mammalian coﬁlin isoforms share basic char - acteristics but function in di(cid:128)erent tissues . The level of coﬁlin expression is much higher in slow muscle than in fast muscle in both adult chicken and mammals ( Hayakawa et al . , 1993 ) , although in chicken only a single coﬁlin isoform is present ( Abe et al . , 1990 ) . The high level of coﬁlin content may have some relationship with the characteristics of type I slow ﬁbers . As we previously demonstrated , coﬁlin expression is signiﬁcantly increased in denervated and dystrophic muscle cells , suggesting that coﬁlin is involved in actin disassembly and / or reorganization during muscle de - generation ( Shinagawa et al . , 1993 ; Hayakawa et al . , 1993 ) . The type of coﬁlin increased in these degenerating muscles was of muscle - type , and NM - CF was scarcely detected ( Okada et al . , 1994 ) . M - CF gene is expressed not only in skeletal muscle but also in cardiac and aorta smooth muscles . How the expression of coﬁlin , particularly M - CF in the case of mammals , is regulated in a tissue - speciﬁc and in a ﬁber - type dependent manner is a subject of considerable interest . We have examined the sequence of the 5 0 - upstream region of M - CF gene and found several putative E - boxes ( Buskin et al . , 1989 ) and GATA family gene - binding motifs ( Merika et al . , 1993 ) in this region ( unpublished data ) , which are known to be involved in skeletal muscle - speciﬁc and cardiac muscle - speciﬁc gene expression , respectively ( Buskin et al . , 1989 ; Charron et al . , 1999 ) . The actual roles of these cis - regulatory elements remain to be uncovered in future studies . We could not detect the other regulatory elements that have been characterized in muscle structural genes , that is , MLC - box , CArG box , and MEF2 site . Two types of transcripts encoding the same protein M - CF molecule are generated from a single gene in muscle . The small - sized transcript , a 1 . 8 kb message , was detected both in skeletal and cardiac muscles , while the longer one , a 3 . 0 kb message , was found only in skeletal muscle . The smaller one was more abundant in young skeletal muscle , while the larger one increased in amount as muscle develops . These observations suggest that generation of the mRNA of 3 . 0 kb is a phenomenon characteristic of skeletal muscle and is related to muscle maturation . We did not ﬁnd any di(cid:128)erence in the generation of 3 . 0 kb mRNA between fast and slow skeletal muscles although the amount of Fig . 7 . Detection of NM - CF and M - CF in cultured muscle cells . Mouse C2 cells cultured in a growth medium ( a , b ) or in a di(cid:128)erentiation medium ( c , d ) were stained doubly with polyclonal antibodies speciﬁc for NM - CF ( a , c ) and a monoclonal antibody speciﬁc for M - CF ( MCF1 ) ( b , d ) followed by treatment with FITC - GARt and TRITC - DARb . Myoblasts in a growth medium were stained by anti - NM - CF but not with MCF1 , while myotubes were stained by both antibodies . Bar : 20 l m . 55 coﬁlin is much larger in slow muscle . A speciﬁc regulatory mechanism ( s ) for generating the larger sized mRNA must exist in skeletal muscle cells . It has been reported that the 3 0 - noncoding region of cytoplasmic b - and c - actin mRNAs is involved in the di(cid:128)erent intracellular localization between these isoactin mRNAs ( Hill and Gunning , 1993 ) . M - CF messages with or with - out the long 3 0 - noncoding region may di(cid:128)er in ability to localize along the intracellular structures and / or stability of the message .
