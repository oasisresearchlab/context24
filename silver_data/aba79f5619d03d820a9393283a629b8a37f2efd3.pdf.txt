A research article contains massive amounts of textual information . Claims are the most significant information in a research article that needs to be retrieved to understand the gist of the research work . A research article contains a number of claims in different sections ( abstract , introduction , results , and discussion ) of an article . A literature review shows that a few studies of claim extraction have been conducted and they are limited to extracting claims from the abstract section of the article only . In existing studies claims are classified either on the basis of the keywords or all the words . In existing works semantics and context are ignored , and Bag of Words ( BoW ) representation is used . Deep learning architectures such as Convolutional Neural Network ( CNN ) and Long Short - Term Memory ( LSTM ) have the potential to produce better results through the use of deep learning . Attention mechanism and Bidirectional Long Short - Term Memory ( Bi - LSTM ) have been used for multiple tasks in Natural Language Processing ( NLP ) and give effective results . In this work , we propose a hybrid Bi - LSTM attention model . Bi - LSTM model captures the long - term sequences of words and the attention mechanism highlights the important words or keywords in text . A number of experiments have been performed on research articles claim and standard IBM datasets . We verified our proposed model on two datasets for claim / non - claim classification and our model gives 96 . 7 % and 95 % on both datasets . The results show that our proposed model through deep learning outperforms existing models . Keywords : Claim Extraction , Research Articles , Attention Model , Information Retrieval , Natural Language Processing . 1 . Introduction The volume of research literature is growing exponentially rendering it almost impossible to manually sift through it and identify claims in individual works in a reasonable amount of time . It is especially cumbersome and time consuming for funding agencies that have to decide on the fate of the applications for funding in a short span of time . Claims made in research papers is the crux of the work being written about and any future funding decisions are dependent upon claims made in new papers . Claims , backed by evidence , embody the true contribution made by the scientists working on a specific problem [ 1 ] . However , depending on the writing style , claims made by the authors are spread all over the place within a research article . Even a diligent reader at times fails to comprehensively identify all claims made within a research article . Blake [ 2 ] found that claims are not distributed equally in all sections . They discovered that abstract , introduction , results , and discussion sections contained 7 . 84 % , 28 . 56 % , 23 . 44 % and 43 . 15 % of claims respectively . It makes the task of claims extraction a bit tricky and necessitates their automatic extraction to save on time [ 3 ] . Artificial Intelligence ( AI ) is a broad field of Natural Language Processing ( NLP ) . Claims extraction can be broadly identified as information retrieval or extraction , which falls under the domain of NLP . Text mining plays a vital role to retrieve relevant information from text documents [ 4 ] . Text mining techniques and methodologies can parse a huge amount of text in relatively little time , extracting useful information . To construct a system for textual information retrieval , there are a lot of approaches . One method is to manually define rules or patterns using regular expressions to retrieve information . Blaschke and Valencia [ 5 ] designed a suiseki system by manually designing patterns that extract information on proteins from biomedical documents or text . Another approach is to automatically learn pattern - based extraction rules to identify the relation or entity type . Machine learning techniques are another method for information extraction or classification . Classifiers have been used to predict the label of a sentence based on a token and its context . In literature rule - based approaches have also been used for claims extraction or classification [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] , [ 9 ] . De Ribaupierre [ 7 ] annotated each sentence of a document and used syntactic rules to identify the discourse type of every sentence . Risk of annotation noise can increase when there are a large number of rules . Jansen and Kuhn [ 6 ] proposed a rule - based approach to help researchers know about recent developments by extracting a core claim from the abstract . They used term frequency ( tf ) for keyword extraction . Sateli and Witte [ 10 ] used a rule - based approach to extract claim or contribution sentences from full research articles and they used predefined keywords that point the claims in a sentence . Keywords play an important role in claim extraction . Biomedicine related articles contain a large number of claims . Claims in the domain are not consistently reliable and might contradict each other . Thus , identification and rectification of contradictory claims play a big role in the improvement of the system . Alamri and Stevenson [ 11 ] extracted the contradictory claims from the abstract and proposed systematic reviews related to four cardiovascular topics . Using RNN they extracted different types of sentences from the lawsuit documents and every sentence was annotated with one of the five labels [ 12 ] . Every sentence in a document must have discourse type ( like definition , hypothesis , method , result etc . ) . They extracted these types of sentences using a syntactic approach . In previous work , not all claims were extracted from the full articles and Bag - of - Words ( BoW ) representations were used to assign the weights to words . However , to the best of our knowledge semantic relations between words in the domain of claims extraction has not been explored . Semantics is hidden within the context of words as is popularly known in the NLP community that “A word is known by the company it keeps . ”In existing work claims are classified either on the basis of the keywords or all the words , regardless of the importance of the individual words or keywords . To resolve the issues identified above , we have proposed a hybrid Bi - LSTM attention model and its comparison is done with existing studies [ 12 ] , [ 22 ] , [ 24 ] , [ 29 ] , [ 30 ] . We implemented our model on a standard IBM dataset and on claim sentences of research articles . On both datasets our model performed well . Main contributions of this study are given below :  We propose a novel hybrid Bi - LSTM attention model to classify claims from the research articles . Our novel hybrid model improves the performance effectively for claim classification in research articles as compared to previous state - of - the - art methods . To capture the semantics of the word , Word2Vec model is used . We implemented Bi - LSTM to capture long - distance sequences in backward and forward directions .  Keywords are the most important aspect in text classification , so we introduce the attention mechanism for claims / non - claims classification . The attention mechanism gives high weights to keywords and attention is more suitable to learn the weights of keywords . To give the attention to keywords we embed attention mechanism in neural networks .  Proposed a rule - based approach with different keyword extraction techniques to build a dataset of research articles claim and non - claim sentences and compared with the existing study . In our study we used these claim and non - claim sentences as dataset and performed experiments . The rest of the paper is organized as follows . Section 2 presents related work . About corpus the detail is discussed in section 3 . The proposed model for claim extraction is presented in section 4 . Section 5 presents the experimental setup . The experimental results , comparison with existing studies are presented in Section 6 . At the end this study is concluded in section 7 . 2 . Related work Much effort has gone in the recent past to extract information from research articles . Researchers used machine learning and deep learning approaches for information extraction . In existing studies , authors extracted entities and relation from biomedical research papers using deep learning [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] , [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] . Researchers present in [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] a hierarchical neural network model to classify sentences from abstract of biomedical . Wackerbauer [ 20 ] used a binary classifier to identify the key sentences or summary of research articles . The comparative sentences identification systems are presented in [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] . Authors identified hypothesis of research from the abstract of biomedical research literature [ 9 ] . In a research paper claims are the most important information . However , little work has done for claim extraction from research papers . To retrieve claim from text rule - based and machine learning approaches are used . Blake introduced a Claim Framework , which is an annotation scheme that shows how scientists communicate claims and findings of the empirical study of biomedicine in full - text articles [ 2 ] and they defined different types of claims and identified explicit claims . Ahmed et al , identified location and number of claims [ 23 ] by Claim Framework introduced by Blake in the domain of social sciences . In studies [ 13 ] , [ 24 ] , [ 25 ] authors identified different types of claims sentences from text using classifiers . In [ 9 ] , the authors proposed a method which extracts claims from research articles of the biomedicine field . They are extracting claims from abstract only . For claim extraction authors used the rule - based method and used tf for keyword extraction . They assigned scores to sentences and extract a single sentence as a claim which has the highest rank . Researchers are identifying Salient factual claims using a neural network model in the study [ 26 ] . An idea is introduced by authors [ 27 ] of discovering two types of scientific claims : dominant and dominated to annotate them . They introduced the set of features to focus on the claim and its content . Researchers automate the process of identifying claim sentences from the literature review . Rule - based or machine learning techniques are used for claim extraction . In rule - based approaches , a large number of rules increase the annotation noise that affects performance [ 7 ] . The scientific literature contains multiple types of many claims , however , existing studies not extracted all types of claims . In discussed literature review BoW representations were used to assign the weights to words , however , they are unable to capture the semantics between words . So , there is a need of representation which captures the semantics . Keywords play an important role in text classification . In existing studies , in rule - based authors manually defined the keywords and in machine learning they used keyword extraction techniques to classify the claims . Later neural networks assign weights to all words , regardless of the importance of the words . There is a need for a model which resolve shortcoming of related work .

Corpus Formation For the purposes of this research , we have used two datasets . One is the IBM dataset of claims 1 and the other is our own . Extraction of our own dataset the classification in Fig . 1 as a block diagram , in which the steps performed for sentence extraction has been shown . As a first step , scientific research articles were collected , and preprocessing was performed . The research articles were then given as input to model and keywords were extracted from the text data . Both claim and non - claim sentences were extracted . The classification was done using neural networks and the claims were identified . Fig . 1 Block Diagram of Corpus Building Extraction of sentences Algorithm 1 shows the process claim extraction from research articles to build the dataset . Claims form the gist of what a research article is about . In other words , they summarize the topic . Our work revolves around claim extraction . In our work , has content we extracted the claim sentences . We extracted the sentences on the basis of the following factors : • match sentence with defined patterns • keywords extracted by RAKE Algorithm 1 Shows the Process of Dataset Preparation from Research Articles 1 https : / / www . research . ibm . com / haifa / dept / vst / debating _ data . shtml Input : text documents ( D ) Output : sentences 1 . repeat step 2 to 4 2 . for each d ∈ D keywords  keyword _ extraction ( lines ) for each line ∈ lines \ \ reading document line by line if ( acknowledge , body , reference in line ) start  FALSE if ( abstract in line ) start  TRUE End if End for scored _ sentences  call ranking ( lines , keywords ) \ \ call a function which assigns score to sentences core _ sentence  call select _ sentence ( scored _ sentences ) \ \ call a function which extract a sentence which have highest score 3 .

End repeat Fig . 2 Extracted claims from a research article Claim sentences usually start with phrases such as " in this paper , we proposed " , " our results show ” , " this study reveals” , " in conclusion” , “ these findings” etc . A sentence with these types of structure is most probably a claim sentence . To discover these types of sentences we defined the patterns . Fig . 2 shows the extracted claims through our technique when a research article is given as input . We also extracted keywords from the full research article using different keyword extraction techniques . These extracted keywords are also used for sentence extraction . Table 2 Corpus Building Results Comparison Existing ( tf ) [ 6 ] TextRank RAKE Extracted claims 69 . 6 % 87 . 2 % 88 % The research articles are given as input and different rules are applied using a regular expression . For keyword extraction , we used RAKE [ 28 ] . In a scientific article multiple claims are defined in different sections . In our work , we extracted claim sentences from the full articles . Table 2 shows the results of corpus building experiments , here RAKE outperformed TextRank and tf used in existing work [ 6 ] . We used these extracted claim and non - claim sentences as a corpus in further work . 4 . Proposed method Our aim is to automatically find claim sentences from research articles , which can be framed as a classification problem . To identify claims , we performed classification using well - known machine learning and deep learning techniques and approaches such as Support Vector Machine ( SVM ) , Naïve Bayes , Logistic Regression , Random Forest , CNN , Bi - LSTM and the attention - based model . Fig . 3 shows the overall flow of our proposed model . It takes the text corpus as an input and performs the pre - processing . In the next step , the model applies word embedding which takes contextual information into account . After that , it captures the long - term dependencies between the words using the Bi - LSTM model . The attention mechanism is used to give attention to important words in a sentence . In the end , the SoftMax function is used to perform the classification . Fig . 3 Flow diagram of claim classification 4 . 1 Background of deep learning 4 . 1 . 1 Word to vector Word2Vc is an unsupervised deep learning model . It creates continuous or numeric vector values of words in a sentence . Word2Vc model measures the distance between words on the basis of word meaning . It embeds each word to the high dimensional vector space . It is able to capture the semantics of words . To obtain equal size vectors padding is applied . 4 . 1 . 2 Long short - term memory ( LSTM ) LSTM is a type of Recurrent Neural Network ( RNN ) . RNNs lose some information due to the vanishing gradient problem . LSTM resolves it and performs well for long term dependencies . It captures the information of past time steps only . However , it cannot capture dependencies if they are too long and does not perform well when the sequence length increases beyond 30 [ 31 ] . In our model , we used the Bidirectional version of the LSTM which captures the information of past and future time steps . Its context understanding is better than the simple LSTM and has the ability to capture deeper semantics of the words . It reads the input sequence of words 𝑋 = { 𝑥 1 , 𝑥 2 , … , 𝑥 𝑖 } and calculate the forward ℎ 𝑖 ⃗⃗⃗ and ℎ 𝑖 backward sequences of hidden statements . The forward and backward hidden states are concatenated to obtain the representation ℎ 𝑡 . Equation 1 shows the RNN model , where f is the function , h t - 1 is the previous state , h t is the new state and 𝑥 𝑡 is the input at time t . Equation 2 represents the concatenation of the forward and backward sequences . Equations 3 - 6 represent the cell and gates of LSTM . In equations 3 - 6 , 𝑥 𝑡 is input at time 𝑡 , b is the bias , 𝑊 is the weight vector of hidden states , ℎ 𝑡−1 is previous state and 𝐼 𝑡 , 𝐹 𝑡 , 𝑀 𝑡 and 𝑇 𝑜 denote input gate , forget gate , memory cell and output gate . ℎ 𝑡 = 𝑓 ( ℎ 𝑡−1 , 𝑥 𝑡 ) ( 1 ) ℎ 𝑡 = [ ℎ 𝑖 ⃗⃗⃗ ; ℎ 𝑖 ] ( 2 ) 𝐼 𝑡 = 𝜎 ( 𝑤 𝑖 . ( ℎ 𝑡−1 ) , 𝑥 𝑡 + 𝑏 𝑖 ) ( 3 ) 𝐹 𝑡 = 𝜎 ( 𝑤 𝑓 . ( ℎ 𝑡−1 ) , 𝑥 𝑡 + 𝑏 𝑓 ) ( 4 ) 𝑀 𝑡 = 𝑡𝑎ℎℎ ( 𝑤 𝑡 . ( ℎ 𝑡−1 ) , 𝑥 𝑡 + 𝑏 𝑚 ) ( 5 ) 𝑇 𝑜 = 𝜎 ( 𝑤 𝑜 . ( ℎ 𝑡−1 ) , 𝑥 𝑡 + 𝑏 𝑜 ) ( 6 ) 4 . 1 . 3 Attention mechanism Attention mechanism has been successfully used [ 32 ] in many NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis , machine translation , document classification and question answering system . The intuition behind the attention mechanism is to give attention to important words in the text . Fig . 4 shows the process of how to give attention to important words or keywords . First , we calculate the attention weights on the basis of input vectors and sentence level feature vectors . Then we multiply attention weights ( 𝐴 ) with context vectors ( 𝑐 ) , which are then combined with sentence - level feature vectors to generate the attention vectors ( ℎ 𝑎 ) . At last , the attention vector is used for output . In equation 8 h t is word representation of hidden states of Bi - LSTM . We take ℎ 𝑖 hidden vectors as input . The equation 8 is used to calculate the scores of input and target vectors . Equation 9 is used to normalize the scores by using SoftMax activation function . The equation 10 is used to derive the context vector c that captures the input information to predict the y t . To produce the attention vector h a , we concatenate both the vectors 𝑐 and h t . After extracting the attention vector , the vector is fed to SoftMax for classification that produces the output as shown in equation 12 . 𝑎 𝑡 = ( ℎ | | 𝑡 𝑇 ⋅ ℎ 𝑖 ) ( 8 ) 𝐴 = 𝑠𝑜𝑓𝑡𝑀𝑎𝑥 ( 𝑎 𝑡 ) ( 9 ) 𝑐 = ∑ ( 𝐴𝑖 . ℎ 𝑖 ) 𝑖𝑖 = 1 ( 10 ) ℎ 𝑎 = [ 𝑐 ; ℎ 𝑡 ] ( 11 ) 𝑦 𝑡 = 𝑠𝑜𝑓𝑡𝑀𝑎𝑥 ( ℎ 𝑎 ) ( 12 ) Fig . 4 Attention mechanism 4 . 1 . 4 Convolutional neural network ( CNN ) The CNN model is a type of neural networks . It is adopted from the image processing filed , however , it performed well in NLP filed . A CNN model is presented in Fig . 5 . It is a combination of convolutional and pooling layers followed by a fully connected layer . CNN has performed well on different NLP tasks . It extracts high - level features from the text . The convolutional layer is used to capture the dependencies . Pooling layers are applied to extract important features or information and it reduces the computational power . The fully connected layer is applied to perform classification . Equation 13 is used to calculate the number of output features for each dimension in CNN . CNN model does not capture the information of both directions . To capture the backward and forward sequences we implemented Bi - LSTM with attention .

Our proposed model resolved above mention issues . Firstly , our model captures the semantics of words using Word2Vec method to resolve the issue of BoW . For better understanding of context and capture the information in both directions we implemented Bi - LSTM . All words cannot be considered equal , to give high weights to important words used attention mechanism . The architecture of the proposed hybrid Bi - LSTM attention model with all layers of the model is presented in Fig . 6 . 1 . Input Layer : feeds the sentences to the model . 2 . Embedding Layer : this layer maps each word of a sentence into a high dimensional vector that captures approximate semantics of a word 3 . Bi - LSTM : this layer gets high - level features from the embedding layer . We used dropout to prevent our model from overfitting . It discards the unnecessary information which does not enhance the performance of the model . Bi - LSTM generates a sentence level feature vector . 4 . Attention Mechanism : finds the attention weight vector and merges it with the context vector and produces the output vector . For claim classification , existing methods either classify on the basis of keywords or treat all words equally , regardless of their importance . Attention resolves this issue . Attention mechanism assigns weights to important words on the basis of input vectors and sentence level feature vectors generated by Bi - LSTM . Attention mechanism outputs an attention vector , which is fed to the next layer for classification . 5 . Output Layer : attention vectors are used for claim classification . S oftMax is used in the last layer , which gives theresults in the form of 0 , 1 . Fig . 6 Architecture of proposed hybrid Bi - LSTM attention model 5 . Experimental setup In this section , we provide the experimental setup details for this study . We performed the experiments on the windows 7 , processor core m3 - 7Y30 1 . 61 GHz , RAM 8 . 00GB and hard disk 1024 GB . Experiments were performed in Spyder ( python 3 . 6 ) in this work . Experiments were performed on our own research articles dataset and IBM claim dataset . We split the dataset in 70 : 30 , 70 % for training and 30 % for testing . Several experiments were performed using deep learning and machine learning techniques such as SVM , Naïve Bayes , Logistic Regression , Random forest , Ensamble learning , CNN and RNN . Our proposed hybrid Bi - LSTM attention model achieve better results with high precision , accuracy , and recall as compared to traditional existing techniques or methods . Table 3 shows the tuning parameters used in our proposed hybrid Bi - LSTM attention model . When training a neural network model , it is required to take a lot of decisions about these tuning parameters . These parameters have a lot of impact on model working .

Result and discussion In this section , we discuss the results of experiments that we performed by implementing approaches of existing papers and our proposed model . We perform a comparison of the results produced by all approaches . 6 . 1 Claim classification In this study , we proposed a hybrid Bi - LSTM attention model for claim extraction by implementing deep learning Bi - LSTM and attention mechanism . In the proposed model a word2vec technique is used to convert words into vector form and apply Bi - LSTM on vectors to extract the features . Bi - LSTM captures the sequences in both forward and backward directions . Bi - LSTM captures the long - term dependencies in a better way as compared to traditional techniques . The attention mechanism is implemented to give high weights to important words . Due to these mentioned advantages our proposed hybrid Bi - LSTM attention model perform well than other implemented approaches . We implemented the existing techniques and provided a comparison . A number of experiments are performed by applying many machine learning and deep learning techniques . For comparison we applied deep learning CNN architecture . We applied our proposed hybrid model on both datasets that comprised of many claim and non - claim sentences and our proposed model performed well on both datasets . Our proposed hybrid Bi - LSTM attention model outperformed other techniques . We compared our proposed model with existing approaches [ 12 ] , [ 22 ] , [ 24 ] , [ 29 ] , [ 30 ] in Table 4 . These approaches are used to extract claims sentences from research articles or law documents . We used two datasets to evaluate our proposed hybrid Bi - LSTM attention model . In this study , CNN performance is comparable , however , multiple convolutional layers are used to capture the long - term dependencies . So , the model becomes very deep and complex .

Fig . 7 presents the accuracy comparison of implemented approaches in graphical representation . Our model accuracy is high because our model has the ability to capture sequence in both direction and attention give a high score to the important words produced by the hidden states of Bi - LSTM . Keywords play an important role in text classification . Attention model gives the concept of the keywords in deep learning . Traditional models assign weights to all words and perform classification on the bases of these weights . However , attention gives high weights to keywords and other words have fewer weights . This increase the accuracy of the model . Traditional machine learning approaches used BoW technique for word representation . BoW technique does not care about the semantics of words . It also does not respect the order of the words in a sentence . Machine learning techniques do not have the ability to capture long - term dependencies in both directions . All traditional machine learning classifiers performance is average in term of accuracy . Fig . 7 All implemented techniques accuracy comparison The CNN have produced 94 % accuracy , 85 % precision and 89 % recall , however the proposed Bi - LSTM with attention model have produced 96 . 7 % , 91 % and 88 % accuracy , precision and recall respectively . We verified our proposed hybrid Bi - LSTM attention model on IBM and research articles claims dataset . Table 5 shows the result of our model on both datasets in terms of accuracy , recall and precision . On both datasets our model performance is good . Our model gives 96 . 7 % accuracy on the dataset of research articles built by us and 95 % accuracy on IBM dataset .

Conclusion and Future Work Automatic extraction and classification of required information such as claims from research articles is an important task . In this study , for claim classification , we proposed a hybrid Bi - LSTM attention model . In our model to captures semantics deeply we implemented Word2Vec and to capture long distance - sequences we applied Bi - LSTM . To learn the high weights of keywords in neural networks we applied attention . We evaluated our proposed model on two data sets such as our own data set of research article claim sentences and IBM dataset of claim sentences . On both datasets our model provided 96 . 7 % and 95 % accuracy . We compared our results with existing approaches used for claims extraction . Our model achieves high accuracy as compared to existing techniques used in the literature . All results show that our proposed hybrid Bi - LSTM attention model outperforms other state - of - the - art claim classification techniques in term of accuracy . In this study , we performed claim extraction in the research articles written in the English language . In future , the articles are written in other languages such as Chinese , Urdu , French can be explored for claim extraction . More deep learning models can be investigated . References [ 1 ] K . J .
