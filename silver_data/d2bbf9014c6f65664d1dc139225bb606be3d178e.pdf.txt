EFHD2 is regulated by Ca 2 + binding , sta - bilizes F - actin , and promotes neurite extension . Previous studies indicated a dysregulation of EFHD2 in human Alzheimer’s disease brains . We hypothesized a detrimental effect of genetic ablation of Efhd2 on hippocampal integrity and speciﬁcally investigated adult hippocampal neurogenesis . Efhd2 was expressed throughout adult neuronal development and in mature neurons . We observed a severe reduction of the survival of adult newborn neurons in Efhd2 knockouts , starting at the early neuroblast stage . Spine formation and dendritegrowthofnewbornneuronswerecompromisedinfull Efhd2 knockouts , butnotuponcell - autonomous Efhd2 deletion . Together with our ﬁnding of severe hippocampal tauopathy in Efhd2 knockout mice , these data connect Efhd2 to impaired synaptic plasticity as present in Alzheimer’s disease and identify a role of Efhd2 in neuronal survival and synaptic integration in the adult hippocampus . INTRODUCTION SWIPROSIN - 1 / EFHD2 ( EFHD2 ) is an F - actin - stabilizing protein , whose coiled - coil domain mediates dimerization in a Ca 2 + - dependent manner . EFHD2 also acts as putative cytoskeletal adaptor interacting with the microtubule - asso - ciated protein TAU ( Ferrer - Acosta et al . , 2013 ; Hagen et al . , 2012 ; Kwon et al . , 2013 ) . We have previously shown that EFHD2 is highly expressed in the CNS throughout embry - onic development and in the adult ( Purohit et al . , 2014 ) . The serine - threonine protein kinase cyclin - dependent kinase 5 ( CDK5 ) regulates the Ca 2 + - binding afﬁnity of EFHD2 by phosphorylation of EFHD2 at Ser74 ( Va ´ zquez - Rosa et al . , 2014 ) . CDK5 activity is dysregulated in Alz - heimer’s disease ( AD ) and thereby promotes the formation of amyloid beta and the hyperphosphorylation of TAU ( Liu et al . , 2016 ) . A potential involvement / dysregulation of EFHD2 in AD was described previously in AD mouse models and AD postmortem studies ( Tseveleki et al . , 2010 ; Twine et al . , 2011 ; Vega et al . , 2008 ; Ferrer - Acosta et al . , 2013 ; Borger et al . , 2014 ; Vega , 2016 ) . These studies suggested that EFHD2 interacts with TAU and TAU - associ - ated proteins in AD . Adult neurogenesis , the generation of new neurons in the adult brain , persists throughout life within the dentate gyrus ( DG ) of the hippocampus ( Eriksson et al . , 1998 ; Spalding et al . , 2013 ) . Cdk5 is a modulator of adult neuro - genesis ( Jessberger et al . , 2008 ) , and knock down of overac - tivated Cdk5 in mice transgenic for amyloid precursor pro - tein rescued impaired neurogenesis ( Crews et al . , 2011 ) . Given ( 1 ) the link of both Efhd2 and Cdk5 to AD , ( 2 ) the interaction between Cdk5 and Efhd2 , and ( 3 ) the dysregula - tion of adult neurogenesis in AD models and upon Cdk5 deletion , we hypothesized that deletion of Efhd2 nega - tively affects adult neurogenesis . Efhd2 is broadly expressed in the adult neurogenic niche . We demonstrate a severe decrease of adult neurogenesis in the DG of Efhd2 (cid:1) / (cid:1) . There is defective integration of newborn neurons in Efhd2 (cid:1) / (cid:1) . We propose a cell - extrinsic mechanism of Efhd2 deﬁciency mediated by increased levels of phosphorylated TAU in the hippocampus of Efhd2 (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice . Our ﬁndings describe a role of Efhd2 in the adult hippocampal stem cell niche and have potential implications for tauopathies such as AD . RESULTS Efhd2 Is Expressed during Adult Neuronal Development To investigate the role of Efhd2 in the adult hippocampus , we ﬁrst studied hippocampal expression in adult Efhd2 (cid:1) / (cid:1) knockout / LacZ knockin mice . In this model , both Efhd2 alleles were replaced by a LacZ reporter gene downstream of the Efhd2 promoter ( Brachs et al . , 2014 ) . In the hippo - campus , we found high Efhd2 gene expression in the cornu Stem Cell Reports j Vol . 10 j 347 – 355 j February 13 , 2018 j ª 2017 The Authors . 347 This is an open access article under the CC BY - NC - ND license ( http : / / creativecommons . org / licenses / by - nc - nd / 4 . 0 / ) . ammonis regions CA1 and CA2 and in the DG ( Figures 1A , S1A , and S1B ) . In the DG , Efhd2 was not only expressed in NeuN - positive mature neurons , but also in Sox2 - positive radial glia - like cells and DCX - positive neuroblasts ( Fig - ures S1C – S1G ) . The observed expression in adult neural stem cells correlates with expression of Efhd2 in murine embryonic stem cells ( data not shown ) . As shown previ - ously ( Fischer et al . , 2005 ; Jessberger et al . , 2008 ) , p35 , the regulatory subunit of CDK5 , was expressed in the DG , including its expression in DCX - positive neuroblasts ( Figure S1H ) .

DG volume was compara - ble between Efhd2 (cid:1) / (cid:1) and Efhd2 + / + , suggesting that the overall structure of the DG was unchanged in Efhd2 (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice ( Figures S2A and S2B ; Table S1 ) . The total number of NeuN - positive neurons in the granule cell layer was un - changed ( Figure S2C ) and zinc - transporter - 3 - based anal - ysis of the mossy ﬁber pathway area showed comparable sizes of the axonal compartment of DG neurons in Efhd2 (cid:1) / (cid:1) and controls ( Figures S2D – S2G ) . These results suggest that the overall anatomy of the DG is unchanged in Efhd2 (cid:1) / (cid:1) . Compromised Survival of Adult Newborn Neurons in Efhd2 (cid:1) / (cid:1) Observing expression of Efhd2 throughout adult neuronal development , we hypothesized a role of Efhd2 for adult neurogenesis . We ﬁrst analyzed proliferation within the DG using the marker PCNA , which was not altered in 4 - month - old Efhd2 (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice ( Figures 1B and 1C ) . This result was conﬁrmed by 5 - ethynyl - 2 0 - deoxyuridine ( EdU ) labeling of proliferating cells , which was unchanged 4 hr after labeling in Efhd2 (cid:1) / (cid:1) ( Figures 1D – 1F ) . Next , bromodeoxyuridine ( BrdU ) was applied to 3 - month - old Efhd2 (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice and controls . We observed a severely decreased number of BrdU - positive cells in Efhd2 (cid:1) / (cid:1) 1 month after BrdU - injection ( 427 ± 92 cells per hemi - sphere ± SD in EFhd2 (cid:1) / (cid:1) versus 716 ± 241 in controls ; p < 0 . 05 ; Figures 1G – 1J ) . The fraction of NeuN - positive cells among BrdU - positive cells in Efhd2 (cid:1) / (cid:1) was similar to controls . This indicates that the rate of neuronal differ - entiation is not altered ( Table S1 ) . When calculating the number of newborn neurons , we found a 46 % reduc - tion of the total number of BrdU / NeuN double - positive newborn neurons after 1 month ( 318 ± 28 in Efhd2 (cid:1) / (cid:1) versus 592 ± 201 in controls ; p < 0 . 01 ; Figure 1K ) . Given this profound reduction of surviving newborn neurons despite unchanged DG volume and neuron numbers , our ﬁndings suggest that neurogenesis is compromised in Efhd2 (cid:1) / (cid:1) speciﬁcally in the adult . Loss of Neuroblasts and Increased Cell Death in Efhd2 (cid:1) / (cid:1) Mice We next aimed to determine the stage at which adult - born neurons are lost in the Efhd2 (cid:1) / (cid:1) DG . We analyzed the num - ber of BrdU - positive cells 14 days after labeling and observed a signiﬁcant decrease by 60 % in Efhd2 (cid:1) / (cid:1) ( Figures 2A and 2B ) . Immature adult - generated hippocampal neu - rons undergo well - deﬁned morphological changes during their maturation ( Brown et al . , 2003 ; Couillard - Despres et al . , 2005 ) which allows the identiﬁcation of devel - opmental subpopulations ( Figure 2E ) . Comparing the numbers of early , intermediate , and late - stage DCX - posi - tive cells , we found a signiﬁcant reduction in Efhd2 (cid:1) / (cid:1) per - sisting from the early through to the late stage ( Figures 2C and 2D ) . To determine whether there is an additional selec - tive loss of intermediate or late - stage neuroblasts , we calcu - lated the relative loss of DCX - positive cells and found no signiﬁcant differences ( Table S1 ) . As we observed a marked decrease of newly born neu - rons despite unchanged proliferation , we next analyzed whether cell death was altered in the Efhd2 (cid:1) / (cid:1) hippocam - pus . Indeed , the number of cells positive for activated cas - pase - 3 was signiﬁcantly increased in the DG of Efhd2 (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice ( Figures 2F – 2H ) . Efhd2 - Deletion Affects Dendrite Outgrowth and Spine Formation of Adult Newborn Neurons To determine whether Efhd2 knockout also impacts the morphogenesis of surviving newborn neurons , we stereo - tactically delivered a GFP retrovirus into the DG at the age of 3 months to label newborn neurons , and analyzed their morphology after 1 month of survival ( Figures 3A and 3B ; Zhao et al . , 2006 ) . Total dendrite length of GFP - labeled neurons was decreased by 38 % ( 328 ± 149 m m [ mean ± SD ] in Efhd2 (cid:1) / (cid:1) animals versus 526 ± 170 in controls ; p < 0 . 05 ) . This ﬁnding was substantiated by Sholl analysis which showed a signiﬁcant reduction of dendrite complexity at intermediate distances from the soma , i . e . , at 100 – 150 m m ( Figure 3E ) . The number of branching points was unchanged between groups ( Fig - ure 3C ) indicating intact branching of newborn neurons’ dendrites . The density of dendritic spines was signiﬁcantly reduced by 59 % in Efhd2 (cid:1) / (cid:1) ( 0 . 501 ± 0 . 220 spines per m m ± SD in Efhd2 (cid:1) / (cid:1) DG versus 1 . 21 ± 0 . 271 in controls ; p < 0 . 05 ; Fig - ure 3F ) . The subpopulation of mushroom spines was iden - tiﬁed based on morphological criteria of spine head size ( Zhao et al . , 2006 ) . We found that the density of mushroom spines was also signiﬁcantly decreased by 54 % in the absence of Efhd2 ( 14 . 5 ± 8 . 5 mushroom spines per nm ± SD in Efhd2 (cid:1) / (cid:1) DG versus 31 . 3 ± 1 . 6 in controls ; p < 0 . 01 ; Figure 3G ) . This reduction of spines , and in particular of mushroom spines , provides further evidence for an impairment of dendritic integration of newborn neurons into the molecular layer of Efhd2 (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice . To separate cell - autonomous from cell - non - autonomous effects in Efhd2 (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice , we made use of a newly generated Efhd2 ﬂ / ﬂ mouse model , where exon 2 of the Efhd2 gene had been ﬂanked by loxP sites and is deleted upon Cre - mediated recombination ( Figure S3 ) . Conditional deletion of Efhd2 in adult newborn cells in the DG was induced by a retro - virus expressing both GFP and Cre ( GFP - Cre ) . As only few cells are infected using this approach , while the majority of surrounding neurons maintains normal Efhd2 expres - sion , it allows the speciﬁc investigation of cell - autonomous Stem Cell Reports j Vol . 10 j 347 – 355 j February 13 , 2018 349 Efhd2 deletion in newborn neurons . Comparing the morphologies of adult newborn neurons infected with GFP - Cre versus GFP only , we observed no differences in dendritic branching points , dendrite length , spine density , and mushroom spine density ( Figures 3H – 3N ) . This ﬁnding strongly indicates a cell - non - autonomous mechanism of impaired dendritic morphology of newborn neurons in the adult hippocampus of Efhd2 (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice . Figure 2 .

We thus analyzed expression of pSer202 / pThr205 TAU . Using immunohistochemistry , we found that phos - pho - TAU levels were signiﬁcantly increased in the hippo - campus of Efhd2 (cid:1) / (cid:1) compared with controls , including all hippocampal areas analyzed ( molecular layer , DG , and hilus ; Figures 4A – 4D ) . Moreover , western blot of whole - brain lysates showed abundant presence of phospho - TAU in Efhd2 (cid:1) / (cid:1) , compared with very low expression levels in controls ( Figures 4E and 4F ) . We conclude that lack of Efhd2 leads to increased levels of phospho - TAU and may be directly connected with decreased survival and dendritic integration of adult newborn neurons . DISCUSSION In summary , we show that Efhd2 is strongly expressed in the adult hippocampal neurogenic niche . In Efhd2 (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice , the numbers of neuroblasts and of newborn neurons are markedly reduced . Surviving neurons exhibit impaired dendrite morphology and a reduced number of spines and mushroom spines . This defective dendritic integration is due to a cell - extrinsic mechanism of Efhd2 deﬁciency and is accompanied by increased levels of phosphorylated TAU in the hippocampus of Efhd2 (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice . Our ﬁndings thus broaden the knowledge about the emerging role of Efhd2 in TAU - related neurodegeneration and describe a function of Efhd2 in adult neurogenesis . A multiplicity of regulatory factors impacting the different stages of adult neurogenesis have been identiﬁed , highlighting the exact balance that is needed for the proper functionofadultnewbornneurons ( Gonc¸alvesetal . , 2016 ) . Our results demonstrate a role of Efhd2 in the adult hippo - campus , speciﬁcally for survival and postsynaptic integra - tion of newborn neurons . Mushroom spines are sites of sta - ble synaptic input and are thus major mediators of memory engram . Adultnewbornneurons arecriticalformemory en - coding involving pattern - separation tasks ( Aimone et al . , 2014 ) . Particularly in light of the animals’ increased levels of phospho - TAU , characterization of memory function in Efhd2 (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice will be an important future experiment . Volumetry of the DG and of the mossy ﬁber pathway , as well as the total number of neurons in the granule cell layer , showed no alterations in Efhd2 (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice . In line with this intact overall morphology , the embryonic devel - opment of the CNS in terms of brain volumes and synaptic marker expression were unchanged at the macroscopic level in Efhd2 (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice ( Purohit et al . , 2014 ) . We observe that Efhd2 (cid:1) / (cid:1) neurons display normal dendrite / spine morphology when allowed to develop in a wild - type hippocampal neurogenic niche . These observa - tions imply that cell - extrinsic factors play a major role in the integration deﬁcit observed in Efhd2 (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice . We describe major survival deﬁcits of newborn neu - rons at an early stage . We presently cannot distinguish whether the loss of newborn neurons is caused by cell - intrinsic or - extrinsic mechanisms or by both . In adult - born neurons , intracellular Ca 2 + levels are inﬂuenced by excitatory stimuli and are critical for survival ( Deisseroth et al . , 2004 ) . The Ca 2 + - binding protein EFHD2 operates downstream of CDK5 . Intriguingly , CDK5 was reported to cell autonomously regulate survival of adult - born neu - rons ( Lagace et al . , 2008 ) . These observations raise the interesting possibility that a CDK5 EFHD2 pathway may be involved in regulating the survival of adult - born neurons . Strikingly , we observe an increased phospho - TAU expression in the Efhd2 (cid:1) / (cid:1) hippocampus . Multiple lines of evidence have shown alterations of adult neurogenesis in neurodegenerative diseases including AD ( Winner et al . , 2011 ) . Loss of dendritic spines is a hallmark of AD and is also found in adult newborn neurons in trans - genic AD models ( Sun et al . , 2009 ) . A deﬁcit of the total rate of neurogenesis precedes neuropathology in both the triple - transgenic ( APP / PSEN1 / TAU ) and in the genomic TAU mouse model ( Demars et al . , 2010 ; Komuro et al . , 2015 ) . This indicates that adult neurogenesis may already be affected during early - stage AD pathological events . Our results of defective integration of newborn neurons in the Efhd2 (cid:1) / (cid:1) DG and increased phospho - TAU expression thus raise the intriguing possibility that this adult hippo - campal Efhd2 - related phenotype reﬂects an early neuritic phenotype of neurodegeneration , and that EFHD2 , with its actin - binding ability , has a neuroprotective function . It will be interesting to investigate TAU - associated neurode - generation in aging Efhd2 (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice in more detail in the future . Increased levels of phospho - TAU in the hippocam - pus of Efhd2 (cid:1) / (cid:1) animals suggest a neuroprotective role of Efhd2 .
