Building on a recent model of how semantic relations can be learned from non - relational word embeddings , we present a new computational model of mapping between two analogs . The model adopts a Bayesian framework for probabilistic graph matching , operating on semantic relation networks constructed from distributed representations of individual concepts and of relations between concepts . Through comparisons of model predictions with human performance in a novel mapping task requiring integration of multiple relations , as well as in several classic studies , we demonstrate that the model accounts for a broad range of phenomena involving analogical mapping by both adults and children . We also show the potential for extending the model to deal with analog retrieval . Our approach demonstrates that human - like analogical mapping can emerge from comparison mechanisms applied to rich semantic representations of individual concepts and relations . Keywords : analogy , relations , mapping , retrieval , distributed representations , machine learning Probabilistic Analogical Mapping 3 Introduction Human thinking is based not only on a vast pool of individual concepts , but also on relations between concepts . An explicit relation connects multiple entities , each of which fills a specific role ( e . g . , the relation hit has two roles , which might be instantiated by “hammer hits nail” ) . Relations greatly extend the potential to go beyond similarity of individual entities to find resemblances between situations based on analogy , a form of reasoning routinely used in everyday communication . Thus “hammer hits nail” is analogous to “meteor hits planet” : a meteor plays the same role as a hammer , and a planet the same role as a nail , even though the corresponding entities are very dissimilar . As a more colorful example , a newspaper article describing the difficulty of using a vaccine reservation website during the COVID - 19 pandemic quoted a user’s complaint that , “This website is as dumb as a box of hammers , and as useful as a paper teapot” ( Lopez , 2021 ) . Such analogical metaphors call attention to important connections between dissimilar concepts so as to highlight core similarities in a creative way . Analogy plays an important role in many creative human activities , including scientific discovery ( Dunbar & Klahr , 2012 ) , engineering design ( Chan & Schunn , 2015 ) , mathematics education ( Richland , Zur , & Holyoak , 2007 ) , and metaphor comprehension ( Holyoak , 2019 ; Holyoak & Stamenković , 2018 ) . For reviews of relational processing in humans , see Gentner ( 2010 ) , Halford , Wilson , and Phillips ( 2010 ) , and Holyoak ( 2012 ) ; and for a review of its neural substrate see Holyoak and Monti ( 2021 ) . In general , analogical reasoning serves to transfer knowledge from a familiar and better - understood source analog to a more novel target analog . Analogical reasoning can be decomposed into multiple subprocesses ( Holyoak , Novick , & Melz , 1994 ) : retrieval of one or more relevant source analogs given a target , mapping to identify systematic correspondences between elements of a source and target , inference to generate new conjectures about the target based on its mapping Probabilistic Analogical Mapping 4 with the source , and schema induction to form a more abstract representation capturing commonalities shared by the source and target . These subprocesses are interrelated , with mapping considered to be the pivotal process ( Gentner , 1983 ) . Mapping may play a role in retrieval , as mapping a target analog to multiple potential source analogs stored in memory can help identify one or more that seems promising ; and the correspondences computed by mapping support subsequent inference and schema induction . Thus , because of its centrality to analogical reasoning , the present paper focuses on the process of mapping between two analogs . We also consider the possible role that mapping may play in analog retrieval . Computational Approaches to Analogy Computational models of analogy have been developed in both artificial intelligence ( AI ) and cognitive science over more than half a century ( for a recent review and critical analysis , see Mitchell , 2021 ) . These models differ in many ways , both in terms of basic assumptions about the constraints that define a “good” analogy for humans , and in the detailed algorithms that accomplish analogical reasoning . For our present purposes , two broad approaches can be distinguished . The first approach , which can be termed representation matching , combines mental representations of structured knowledge about each analog with a matching process that computes some form of relational similarity , yielding a set of correspondences between the elements of the two analogs . The structured knowledge about an analog is typically assumed to approximate the content of propositions expressed in predicate calculus ; e . g . , the instantiated relation “hammer hits nail” might be coded as hit ( hammer , nail ) . This type of representation requires a symbol to specify the relation R , a separate representation of its arguments ( roles ) a 1 , a 2 . . . a n , and a set of bindings between relation and arguments ( thereby distinguishing “hammer hits nail” from “nail hits hammer” ; Halford , Wilson , & Phillips , 1998 ) . Multiple propositions can be linked by shared Probabilistic Analogical Mapping 5 arguments ( Kintsch , 1988 ) ( e . g . , hit ( hammer , nail ) , enter ( nail , wall ) ) , or by higher - order relations ( Gentner , 1983 ) that take one or more propositions as arguments ( e . g . , cause ( hit ( hammer , nail ) , enter ( nail , wall ) ) ) . Many analogy models have represented analogs using classical symbolic representations that directly correspond to predicate - calculus notation ( Falkenhainer , Forbus , & Gentner , 1989 ; Forbus , Gentner , & Law , 1995 ; Forbus , Ferguson , Lovett , & Gentner , 2017 ; Holyoak & Thagard , 1989 ; Keane & Brayshaw , 1988 ; Thagard , Holyoak , Nelson , & Gochfeld , 1990 ; Winston , 1980 ) ; others have adopted specialized neural codes ( e . g . , tensor products or neural synchrony ) that can capture both the structure and information content of propositions ( Doumas , Hummel , & Sandhofer , 2008 ; Halford et al . , 1998 ; Hummel & Holyoak , 1997 , 2003 ) . Taking structured representations of individual analogs as inputs , representation - matching models use some form of similarity - based algorithm to identify correspondences . For models based on explicit symbolic representations ( e . g . , Falkenheiner et al . , 1989 ; Holyoak & Thagard , 1989 ; Winston , 1980 ) , analogical mapping can be viewed as a form of graph matching , where each individual analog is encoded as a structured graph with labeled nodes and edges . Mapping involves the creation of matches between elements of source and target propositions at multiple hierarchical levels ( e . g . , matches between objects , between relations , and between propositions ) . Classical symbolic representations code relations as atomic elements , which do not capture degrees of similarity ( e . g . , the symbol for the relation harm is no more similar to that for injure than that for heal ) . To avoid combinatorial explosion ( which would arise if any element could match any other ) , matching of relations is typically restricted to those that are identical or closely connected in a predefined taxonomy via common superordinates ( e . g . , Forbus et al . , 1995 ; Thagard et al . , 1990 ; Winston , 1980 ) . These restrictions limit the flexibility of classical symbolic models ( Hofstadter & Mitchell , 1994 ) . Models that express propositional content in distributed neural codes allow Probabilistic Analogical Mapping 6 greater flexibility in matching relations that are similar but not identical , and can also find plausible matches between predicates with different numbers of arguments ( e . g . , matching a large animal to the larger of two animals ; Hummel & Holyoak , 1997 ) . Analogy models in the broad tradition of representation matching , such as the Structure Mapping Engine ( SME ; Falkenhainer et al . , 1989 ) , which is based on classical symbolic representations ; Structured Tensor Analogical Reasoning ( STAR ; Halford et al . , 1998 ) , which is based on tensor products ; and Learning and Inference with Schemas and Analogies ( Hummel & Holyoak , 1997 , 2003 ) , and the closely - related Discovery Of Relations by Analogy ( DORA ; Doumas et al . , 2008 ) , which ar e based on neural synchrony , capture many important aspects of human analogical reasoning . Despite their important differences , all of these models conceive of analogical reasoning in terms of a comparison process applied to complex knowledge representations designed to capture the structure of predicates and their associated bindings of entities into roles . These models , like humans , operate in a domain - general manner . They are able to solve analogies taken from stories and problems with open - ended semantic content , such as the Rutherford - Bohr analogy between planetary motion and atomic structure , or a story about military tactics that suggests an analogous solution to a medical problem ( Gick & Holyoak , 1980 ) . Also like humans , these models do not require extensive direct training on analogy problems in the target domain , and can yield what is termed “zero - shot learning” : generalization to a new type of problem without prior examples of that type . But despite their notable achievements , models based on representation matching have been handicapped by the lack of a domain - general , automated process for generating the symbolic representations required as their inputs . In principle , these representations are viewed as the products of perception ( for visual analogies ) or of language comprehension ( for analogies between Probabilistic Analogical Mapping 7 texts ) . But in the absence of full computational models of how either perception or comprehension might yield structured knowledge representations , the inputs to analogy models have typically been hand - coded . At a theoretical level , this limitation leads to the danger of excessive “tailorability” ( Forbus et al . , 2017 ) : modelers may assume the existence of input representations that dovetail with their favored matching algorithm ( e . g . , positing “helpful” invariant features , identical relations , or higher - order propositions ) . Within circumscribed domains , significant progress has been made in automating the formation of representations suitable as inputs to SME ( e . g . , Lovett & Forbus , 2017 ; Forbus et al . , 2017 ) ; and the DORA model is able to learn predicate - argument structures that provide inputs to LISA ( Doumas et al . , 2008 ; Doumas , Puebla , Martin , & Hummel , 2020 ) . Nonetheless , representation - matching models have yet to demonstrate the ability to form structured inputs that enable analogical reasoning for open - ended domains based on perceptual or linguistic inputs . At a practical level , without automated procedures for forming the requisite representations , it is prohibitively labor - intensive to hand - code large data sets so as to enable analogical reasoning by machines . The second major approach to computational modeling of analogy , which can be termed end - to - end learning , is a direct application of the type of deep learning that is at the current forefront of AI . This approach , which avoids hand - coding altogether , builds on deep neural networks that support training from raw input stimuli ( e . g . , image pixels , or words in a text ) to a final task in an end - to - end manner . Learning in these networks is typically guided by minimizing errors in performing a particular task . This approach has moved beyond tasks involving pattern recognition ( such as object classification ) , for which deep learning has achieved great success , to reasoning tasks . From this perspective , analogy is viewed as a task for which a deep neural network can be trained end - to - end by providing massive data consisting of analogy problems . Probabilistic Analogical Mapping 8 This approach has been applied with some success to solving visual analogies , notably problems insp ired by Raven’s Progressive Matrices ( RPM ; Raven , 1938 ) , a variant of formal analogy problems based on matrices formed from geometric patterns . After extensive training with RPM - like problems , deep neural networks have achieved human - level performance on test problems with similar basic structure ( Santoro et al . , 2017 ; Zhang et al . , 2019 ; Hill et al . , 2019 ) . Rather than aiming to create explicit relational representations that approximate predicate calculus , end - to - end learning forms representations consisting of complex conjunctions of features distributed across a multilayer network . There is no separable process of assessing the similarity of the two analogs . Rather , deep learning creates representational layers culminating in a final decision layer that selects or generates the best analogical completion . That is , learned representations of analogs are directly linked to the task structure in which they are used . End - to - end learning models represent the current highwater mark in automated analogical inference , as hand - coding of inputs is entirely avoided . However , these AI systems appear quite implausible if interpreted as psychological models . First , their success depends on datasets of massive numbers of RPM - like problems ( e . g . , 1 . 42 million problems in the PGM dataset , Barrett et al . , 2018 ; and 70 , 000 problems in the RAVEN dataset , Zhang et al . , 2019 ) . For example , Zhang et al . ( 2019 ) used 21 , 000 training problems from the RAVEN dataset , and 300 , 000 from the PGM dataset . This dependency on direct training in a reasoning task using big data makes the end - to - end learning approach fundamentally different from human analogical reasoning . When the RPM task is administered to a person , “training” is limited to general task instructions . Because the task is intended to provide a measure of fluid intelligence—the ability to manipulate novel information in working memory ( Snow , Kyllonen , & Marshalek , 1984 ) —extensive pretraining on RPM problems defeats the entire purpose of the test . Probabilistic Analogical Mapping 9 Second , the generalization ability of current end - to - end learning models is limited to test problems that are very similar in content and structure to the training problems . If the content of analogy problems deviates even modestly from that used in the training examples , generalization falls well short of human performance ( e . g . , Ichien et al . , 2021 ) . The end - to - end approach thus fails to account for the human ability to achieve zero - shot learning by analogical transfer . Arguably , this shortcoming is directly related to the fact that end - to - end deep learning does not create explicit relational representations ( Doumas et al . , 2020 ) . Eduction of Relations In the present paper we describe a novel computational model of analogical mapping that addresses the basic question of how inputs to the reasoning process can be generated . Our model is in the tradition of representation matching ( making central use of graph matching ) , but differs from previous proposals in its approach to relation representation . Our approach is not rooted in the logic of predicate calculus , but rather in the seminal theories of human intelligence formulated a century ago . Consider a simple verbal analogy in the proportional format ( A : B : : C : D ) often used on intelligence tests , e . g . , hot : cold : : love : hate . We can think of the A : B pair as the source and C : D as the target . The first thing to note is that the problem statement does not specify any relations . Rather , as Charles Spearman observed , the initial step in solving the analogy is to perform what he termed the eduction of relations : in his own ( rather awkward ) words , “ The mentally presenting of any two or more characters ( simple or complex ) tends to evoke the knowing of relation between them ” ( Spearman , 1923 , p . 63 ; italics in original ) . That is , the reasoner must first mentally “fill in the blanks” in the problem as posed , by retrieving or computing the relation between A and B , and that between C and D . Once these relations have been educed , the reasoner Probabilistic Analogical Mapping 10 can perform a second basic step , the eduction of correlates : assessing the similarity of the A : B and C : D relations to determine whether they are analogous . For verbal problems , Spearman’s concept of “relation” refers to the semantic relation between concepts denoted by words . Semantic relations are more than mere associations ; e . g . , hot : cold : : love : adore consists of two word pairs that are each strongly associated via a salient relation , but the problem does not form a valid analogy because the A : B and C : D relations mismatch . At the same time , semantic relations do not necessarily correspond in a direct way to “predicates” as typically incorporated into analogy models . The canonical examples of relations as predicates center on verbs ( and other linking words ) , as in hit ( hammer , nail ) . But at the level of semantic relations , one can represent “ hammer hits nail ” by identifying relations for the three pairs of content words : hammer : hit , hit : nail , hammer : nail . Verbs , like nouns , denote concepts that enter into pairwise semantic relations—they are not the semantic relations themselves . In the present paper we will refer to verbs and similar linking words as “predicates” when we wish to distinguish such words from semantic relations . Proportional analogies were once a focus of psychological work on analogy ( e . g . , Sternberg , 1977 ) , but fell into disfavor . More recent models in the tradition of representation matching have bypassed proportional analogies on the grounds they are too simplistic—they apparently require just the matching of single relations , rather than finding a rich mapping between systems of relations ( Gentner , 1983 ) . Indeed , proportional analogies do not require the reasoner to perform a mapping process at all : the format directly specifies the correspondences ( A  C , B  D ) , and validity depends solely on the similarity of the educed A : B and C : D relations . Yet paradoxically , these “simplistic” analogies pose a basic problem for the sophisticated computational models that can deal with analogies between stories and word problems . The Probabilistic Analogical Mapping 11 computational models of recent decades require relation - centered propositions as inputs—which is exactly what proportional analogies do not provide . Models that have addressed proportional analogies have simply assumed that relations between word pairs are prestored in long - term memory , ready to be retrieved ( e . g . , Morrison et al . , 2004 ) . For a simple case such as hot : cold : : love : hate , it is indeed plausible that people have prestored the relevant relation , opposite - of . But people can also solve analogies based on less familiar relations , as in mask : face : : alias : name . In such cases reasoners may not have considered the relations between the word pairs prior to receiving the analogy problem . Rather , relations must be educed from representations of the concepts being related . A model that accomplishes the eduction of relations between paired concepts would at least partially address the problem of how relational representations of analogs can be formed by an autonomous reasoner , reducing the need for hand - coding by the modeler . However , modeling the eduction of relations presupposes finding an answer to a yet more basic question : how are semantic relations acquired in the first place ? Plan of the Paper In the remainder of this paper we present and test a new model of analogical mapping over a range of verbal reasoning tasks varying in complexity . The model operates on semantic relation networks —graphs in which feature vectors capture the rich semantics both of individual concepts ( nodes in graphs ) and of pairwise relations between concepts ( edges ) . The proposed mapping model serves as a module in a broader system , making use of the outputs of additional modules that address the acquisition and eduction of relations , as well as text processing . In the spirit of other recent computational models of human cognition ( e . g . , Battleday , Peterson , & Griffiths , 2020 ) , we build on work integrating developments in deep learning with theoretical ideas from cognitive science . Probabilistic Analogical Mapping 12 The inputs to the mapping model are two sets of concepts , respectively selected from the source and target analogs . For analogies based on texts , we explore the potential for using AI algorithms for natural language processing ( NLP ) to aid in selection of key concepts . The model adopts rich semantic representations ( embeddings ) for individual concepts , partially automates the creation of skeletal relational structure for analogs , and then applies Bayesian probabilistic inference to find correspondences between key concepts in each analog by maximizing the similarity between two analogs under the constraint of favoring isomorphic mappings . Mapping in the proposed model depends on semantic relations of the sort considered by Spearman ( 1923 ) , but does not require , nor directly operate on , complex hierarchies of propositions . The model is domain - general , and does not require explicit training in solving analogy problems within any particular domain . The aim is to capture the power of representation matching to produce zero - shot learning by analogy , while at the same time pursuing the theoretical goal of end - to - end learning : to automate the creation of representations that provide the proximal inputs to analogical mapping . Because the overall model is modular in nature , some components could readily be altered or replaced . In dealing with issues related to text processing , we make use of NLP algorithms that have proven helpful in work to date , but these are clearly imperfect and not intended to be definitive . The module that creates vector representations of word meaning might be replaced by some other machine - learning algorithm . The module we use to create vector representations of relation meanings is also subject to revision . Here we compare one model ( an extension of our own earlier work ) with an alternative baseline model , as well as with additional variants created by systematic ablations ( see Supplemental Information ) . The central contribution of the present paper is the proposed mapping module , which takes vector representations of concepts and Probabilistic Analogical Mapping 13 relations as inputs and yields analogical correspondences as outputs . This mapping model would operate in essentially the same manner if the modules that create its inputs were varied . The scope of the model as presented here is limited to verbal analogies ( although a similar approach may be applicable to visual analogies ; Ichien et al . , 2021 ) . We believe the mapping model could in principle be instantiated in a neural network ; however , to maximize its generality we provide a Bayesian formulation based on probabilistic inference . We will first describe the creation of inputs to the mapping model : vector representations of individual concepts , and of semantic relations between concepts . We then focus on the mapping model itself . We apply the model to a novel analogy task that requires the eduction and integration of multiple semantic relations , as well as to a series of classic experiments drawn from the analogy literature . In addition to analogical mapping , we consider how the model could be applied to the problem of analog retrieval . Our treatment of psychological phenomena is selective , emphasizing basic findings regarding human judgments of preferred mappings between analogs , and propensities to retrieve different types of source analogs in response to a given target analog . Forming Representations of Word Meanings and Semantic Relations A general system for analogical mapping that takes verbal inputs must accomplish four component tasks : ( 1 ) creating representations of word meanings ; ( 2 ) learning and then recognizing semantic relations between words ; ( 3 ) integrating representations of word meanings and semantic relations to code complete analogs ; and ( 4 ) comparing analogs to generate a set of correspondences between them . Figure 1 schematizes a set of individual models that operate as modules to support and perform analogical mapping , applied to a simple example . The first two tasks are accomplished by versions of existing models ; the latter two tasks are performed by a new model introduced in the present paper . Probabilistic Analogical Mapping 14 Figure 1 . An illustration of analogical reasoning based on semantic mapping , using Category triplets as an example . From left : Word embeddings ( provided by Word2vec ) are obtained to represent the semantic meaning for each concept ( keyword ) ; relation vectors ( from BART ) are obtained to represent semantic relations instantiated for pairs of concepts . Shades in the blocks represent different values in vectors . Middle : Unaligned semantic relation networks , in which nodes are individual concepts and edges are semantic relations between concept pairs , are created for each analog . Word embeddings ( illustrated as gray blocks ) are assigned as node attributes and relation vectors ( illustrated as blue blocks ) are assigned as edge attributes . Right : Aligned semantic relation networks are generated by performing probabilistic analogical mapping ( with PAM ) to find mappings between the concepts in source and target that maximize the combined similarity based on keywords and relations . Creating Representations of Word Semantic Meanings Using Word2vec As the first step toward automating analogical mapping , we adopt semantic representations of individual words generated by a machine - learning model , Word2vec ( Mikolov et al . , 2013 ) . Word2vec and similar models based on distributional semantics , such as GloVe ( Pennington , Socher , & Manning , 2014 ) and BERT ( Devlin , Chang , Lee , & Toutanova , 2019 ) , have proved successful in predicting behavioral judgments of lexical similarity or association ( Hill , Reichart , & Korhonen , 201 5 ; Hofmann et al . , 2018 ; Pereira , Gershman , Ritter , & Botvinick , 2016 ; Richie & Bhatia , 2021 ) , neural responses to word and relation meanings ( Huth , de Heer , Griffiths , Probabilistic Analogical Mapping 15 Theunissen , & Gallant , 2016 ; Pereira et al . , 2018 ; Zhang , Han , Worth , & Liu , 2020 ) , and high - level inferences including assessments of probability ( Bhatia , 2017 ; Bhatia , Richie , & Zou , 2019 ) and semantic verification ( Bhatia & Richie , in press ) . In the simulations reported here , the semantic meanings of individual concepts are represented by 300 - dimensional embeddings created by Word2vec after training on a corpus of articles drawn from Google News . Creating Representations of Relations between Concepts using BART The second major component of the overall system is a model that acquires representations of the semantic relations between concept words . In keeping with the use of embeddings to represent individual word meanings , we represent relations as vectors . Once representations of semantic relations have been created , then in principle it becomes possible to solve proportional verbal analogies by computing the similarity of the A : B relation to the C : D relation by some generic measure , such as cosine similarity . Word2vec itself has been applied to four - term verbal analogies by computing the cosine distance between difference vectors for A : B and C : D pairs , a measure we refer to as Word2vec - diff ( Zhila , Yih , Meek , Zweig , & Mikolov , 2013 ; for a different distributional approach based specifically on relation terms , see Turney , 2008 , 2013 ) . Although direct application of Word2vec achieved some success for analogies based on semantically - close concepts , it fails to reliably solve problems based on more dissimilar concepts ( Linzen , 2016 ; Peterson , Chen , & Griffiths , 2020 ) . In the present paper we use Word2vec - diff as a baseline model , in which relations are coded in a generic fashion simply as difference vectors . To move beyond generic difference vectors , Word2vec vectors for pairs of individual words can be used as inputs to learn representations of relations in a transformed semantic relation space . Bayesian Analogy with Relational Transformations ( BART ) ( Lu , Chen , & Holyoak , 2012 ; Chen , Lu , & Holyoak , 2017 ; Lu , Wu , & Holyoak , 2019 ) , using supervised training with Probabilistic Analogical Mapping 16 concatenated word pairs coded by Word2vec embeddings , can learn to estimate the probability that any pair of words instantiates any abstract semantic relation drawn from a pool of such relations . This pool includes 135 abstract relation categories , such as category ( fruit : apple ) , similar ( house : home ) , contrast ( hot : cold ) , part - whole ( finger : hand ) , and case relation ( read : book ) . Semantic relations between words are then coded by BART as distributed representations over its set of learned abstract relations . After learning , BART calculates a relation vector consisting of the posterior probability that a word pair instantiates each of the learned relations . Learning in BART . The basic operation of the BART model ( described in detail by Lu et al . , 2019 ) is illustrated in Figure 2 . BART uses a three - stage process to learn semantic relations from nonrelational inputs consisting of positive and negative examples of each target relation ( typically about 20 positive and 70 negative examples ) . The initial input ( bottom layer of the network sketched in Figure 2 , left ) consists of a concatenated vector of length 600 representing a pair of words ( where each word in a pair is coded by a 300 - dimension Word2vec embedding ) . In its first stage , the model augments this raw feature vector by ( a ) computing the difference in the value of each feature between the two words in a pair , ( b ) ordering these differences by magnitude , and ( c ) creating 600 additional features consisting of the raw features reordered according to difference magnitudes . These ranked features will differ for each word pair used in training . Augmenting the raw semantic features with ranked features partially mitigates the problem that across instances , different semantic features may be relevant to a relation ( e . g . , love : hate involves features related to emotion , whereas rich : poor involves features related to wealth ) ; and worse , the features of word embeddings are typically “entangled” ( i . e . , individual features are not readily interpretable ) . Difference ranking places features that generate differences of similar magnitude ( and hence are relatively likely to serve similar semantic functions ) into correspondence , without Probabilistic Analogical Mapping 17 assuming any prior knowledge about which individual features are relevant to any relation for any particular word pair . This first stage culminates in the generation of a 1 , 200 - dimension augmented feature vector for each word pair , consisting of the concatenation of raw and ranked feature vectors for each word in the pair ( second layer from bottom in Figure 2 , left ) . In its second stage , BART applies logistic regression with elastic net regularization to difference vectors for all features , selecting a subset of features in the second layer that are most statistically important in predicting the relation being trained ( yielding the third layer from bottom in Figure 2 , left ) , and estimating the associated coefficients . In its third stage , BART uses Bayesian logistic regression to estimate the weight distribution representing the target relation R based on the selected features of word pairs for all training examples . This regression includes a contrast prior derived from the second stage ( i . e . , for each feature included in stage 3 , the initial coefficient for the first word in a pair is set equal to that estimated in stage 2 , and the initial coefficient for the second word is set to the negative of that value ) . Figure 2 . Left : Schematic illustration of BART model architecture for relation representation . The bottom layer of the BART model is a concatenated input vector based on the two words in a pair ; the top layer indicates the set of learned relations ( ellipses indicate additional relations beyond the three illustrated here ) . After learning , the semantic relation between any two words is represented as a vector of the posterior probabilities of each learned relation ; the relation vector ( Rel ) linking love and hate is shown on the top as an illustration . Right : Semantic relations formed by BART generate a transformed ( and disentangled ) space in which pairs instantiating similar sets of Probabilistic Analogical Mapping 18 relations tend to show similar patterns in relation vectors , and hence are located close to one another in the relation space . Relation vectors in BART . As illustrated in Figure 2 ( right ) , BART effectively re - represents the relation between two specific concepts as a vector in a new semantic space ( for a related approach see Roads & Love , 2021 ) , thereby educing the relation between any pair of words . The specific relation between any two words is thus coded as a distributed representation . This representation is disentangled in that each element in the relation vector corresponds to the posterior probability that a particular meaningful relation holds between the concepts . BART’s distributed representations enable the model to generalize to new word pairs that may be linked by relations on which the model had not been specifically trained . By comparing the similarity between relation vectors ( assessed by cosine distance ) , semantic relation representations derived by BART have been used to solve verbal analogies in A : B : : C : D format ( Lu et al . , 2019 ) , to predict human judgments of relation typicality and similarity ( Ichien , Lu , & Holyoak , 2021 ) , and to predict patterns of similarity in neural responses to relations during analogical reasoning ( Chiang , Peng , Lu , Holyoak , & Monti , 2021 ) . For the present project , we trained BART by combining two datasets of semantic relations . The first dataset included 79 specific relations from a taxonomy of ten abstract semantic relations ( Bejar , Chaffin , & Embretson , 1991 ; Jurgens , Turney , Mohammad , & Holyoak , 2012 ) , each with at least 20 word pairs instantiating the same relation . The second dataset ( Popov , Hristova , & Anders , 2017 ) provided 56 additional specific relations , each with 12 - 25 word pairs instantiating the same relation . For each of 135 relations , BART learns to select semantic features 𝐟𝐟 ′𝑳𝑳 and infer the weight distributions 𝐰𝐰 associated with semantic features for each relation from training data ( 𝐟𝐟 ′𝑳𝑳 , 𝑅𝑅 𝐿𝐿 ) using variational Bayesian methods , as summarized in the previous section . After Probabilistic Analogical Mapping 19 learning , BART can estimate how likely a word pair 〈𝒇𝒇 𝟏𝟏 , 𝒇𝒇 𝟐𝟐 〉 instantiates a particular relation 𝑅𝑅 𝑖𝑖 using the computation , 𝑃𝑃 ( 𝑅𝑅 𝑖𝑖 = 1 | 𝒇𝒇 𝟏𝟏 , 𝒇𝒇 𝟐𝟐 ) = ∫ 𝑃𝑃 ( 𝑅𝑅 𝑖𝑖 = 1 | 𝒇𝒇 𝟏𝟏 , 𝒇𝒇 𝟐𝟐 , 𝐰𝐰 ) 𝑃𝑃 ( 𝐰𝐰 | 𝐟𝐟 ′𝑳𝑳 , 𝑅𝑅 𝐿𝐿 ) 𝑑𝑑𝐰𝐰 . ( 1 ) BART then calculates the posterior probability that the word pair instantiates each of the relations in its pool of 270 learned relations , resulting in a distributed representation of relation vector between two words , 𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹 ( 𝒇𝒇 𝟏𝟏 , 𝒇𝒇 𝟐𝟐 ) = 〈 𝑃𝑃 � 𝑅𝑅 1 = 1 � 𝒇𝒇 𝟏𝟏 , 𝒇𝒇 𝟐𝟐 � , 𝑃𝑃 � 𝑅𝑅 2 = 1 � 𝒇𝒇 𝟏𝟏 , 𝒇𝒇 𝟐𝟐 � , … , 𝑃𝑃 � 𝑅𝑅 𝑘𝑘 = 1 � 𝒇𝒇 𝟏𝟏 , 𝒇𝒇 𝟐𝟐 � 〉 . In addition , BART automatically forms representations for the converse of each trained relation . For example , after learning relation representations for the category - instance relation , BART can generate representations for instance - category relation by swapping the weights attached to features of the two words in a pair . Hence , BART relation vectors include 270 dimensions , each encoding posterior probability of a word pair instantiating a relation in a repertoire of 270 relations . Ichien et al . ( 2021 ) found that in modeling human judgments of relational similarity , BART’s predictions are improved by applying a nonlinear power transformation ( with the power parameter of 5 ) to the relation vector . This transformation emphasizes the contributions of those relations with higher posterior probabilities in the similarity calculation ( “winners take most” ) . In modeling mapping of Category triplets ( Simulation 1 ) , a parameter search confirmed that a power of 5 yielded the best fit . According , all BART vectors used in simulations reported here include this power transformation . Role Vectors in BART . Analogical mapping goes beyond judgments of relation similarity in that a coherent mapping requires not only that individual matched relations be similar to one another , but also that elements play corresponding roles across multiple relations ( i . e . , mapping is sensitive to the bindings of concepts into relational roles ) . It is clear that humans are sensitive to semantic roles in relation processing . For example , people not only recognize that mammal : dog Probabilistic Analogical Mapping 20 instantiates the relation category - instance , but also that mammal plays the first role ( category ) rather than the second role ( instance ) . Hence , role information is linked to relation representations , as assumed by some previous computational models of analogy ( e . g . , Hummel & Holyoak , 1997 ) . In addition to evaluating an overall relation , humans are able to evaluate how well entities fill specific roles in that relation ( Popov , Pavlova , & Hristova , 2020 ) . Markman and Stilwell ( 2001 ) provided a taxonomy of categories that explicitly distinguishes between relational and role - governed categories . A study by Goldwater , Markman , and Stilwell ( 2011 , Experiment 3 ) demonstrated that learning a novel relational structure ( instantiated as a novel verb ; e . g . , learning that to cake means “to make a cake” ) licenses learning of novel roles ( e . g . , a caker is “someone who cakes” ) . This path of acquisition is consistent with how BART acquires roles : relations are learned first , then roles are extracted from the learned relations . ( In contrast , the DORA model of Doumas et al . , 2008 , makes the opposite assumption , that individual roles are acquired first and then combined to form multi - place predicates . ) Although people sometimes detect role - based categories without explicit instruction ( Goldwater , Bainbridge , & Murphy , 2016 ) , category labels and analogical comparisons increase general sensitivity to role - based categories ( Goldwater & Markman , 2011 ) . Moreover , objects occupying the same role in a relation ( e . g . , predator ) come to be viewed as more similar to each other overall ( Jones & Love , 2008 ) . In order to represent bindings of concepts to roles in semantic relations , which is required to compute systematic mappings , the version of BART used in the present paper introduces a new extension : the model includes learned representations of the relational roles played by individual concepts . BART relation vectors were augmented with role vectors indicating the probability that the first word in a pair fills the first role of the relation . ( Because the relevant probabilities must sum to 1 across the two words in a pair , it is sufficient to explicitly represent the probability for Probabilistic Analogical Mapping 21 only the first word . ) These role vectors were created using the same training data that was used to train relations in BART . The first word in each word pair instantiating a relation was treated as a positive example , and the second word was treated as a negative example . Role learning operates on top of BART’s relation learning . Weighted feature inputs are generated by elementwise product , 𝐰𝐰 ∘ 𝒇𝒇 , of the semantic features 𝒇𝒇 selected by BART and its learned relation weights 𝐰𝐰 in its third stage connecting the top two layers in Figure 2 . Taking weighted feature vectors derived from BART as the inputs , the model’s Bayesian logistic regression algorithm is reapplied to learn weight distributions 𝛚𝛚 for role representations from training data < 𝐟𝐟 ′𝑳𝑳 , 𝑅𝑅 𝐿𝐿 > . After learning , the role - based weight distributions of 𝛚𝛚 are used to estimate the posterior probability that the first word 𝒇𝒇 𝟏𝟏 in a pair plays the first role in the i th relation : 𝑃𝑃 ( 𝑟𝑟 𝑖𝑖 = 1 | 𝐰𝐰 ∘ 𝒇𝒇 𝟏𝟏 ) = ∫ 𝑃𝑃 ( 𝑟𝑟 𝑖𝑖 = 1 | 𝐰𝐰 ∘ 𝒇𝒇 𝟏𝟏 , 𝛚𝛚 ) 𝑃𝑃 ( 𝛚𝛚 | 𝐰𝐰 ∘ 𝐟𝐟 ′𝑳𝑳 , 𝑅𝑅 𝐿𝐿 ) 𝑑𝑑𝛚𝛚 . ( 2 ) In the remainder of the paper we use the term “relation vector” as shorthand for BART’s concatenation of relational and role vectors . The final relation vectors used in the work reported here consisted of 540 dimensions : 270 posterior probabilities of a word pair instantiating each of the 270 relations BART has acquired , concatenated with 270 posterior probabilities that the first word in the pair plays the first role for each of the 270 relations . ( Performance comparisons with models based on reduced vectors are provided in Supplemental Information . ) Probabilistic Analogical Mapping ( PAM ) Using representations of individual concepts generated by Word2vec and semantic relations between pairs of concepts generated by BART , we have developed a model to accomplish the third and fourth tasks noted above : forming representations of entire analogs and then computing a mapping between them . A general model of analogical mapping that takes two Probabilistic Analogical Mapping 22 complex analogs as inputs must capture the human ability to integrate multiple relations ( Gentner , 1983 ; Halford et al . , 1998 ) . In the example shown in Figure 1 , an ordered sequence of t hree category concepts ( weapon : gun : rifle ) is mapped to a set of scrambled concepts from a different domain ( dog , beagle , and mammal ) . When the source and target analogs involve multiple pairwise relations , as in this example , inherent mapping ambiguities may arise . For example , weapon : gun considered alone could map to either mammal : dog or dog : beagle , because all of these pairs instantiate the superordinate - of relation . As we will show in an experiment reported below , humans can reliably solve such analogy problems ; a comparable requirement to integrate multiple relations arises in many other relational reasoning paradigms , such as transitive inference ( Halford et al . , 1998 ; Waltz et al . , 1999 ) . To resolve ambiguity in local mappings , a reliable analogy model must assess relation similarities and integrate across relations based on mapping constraints . To compute mappings between concepts in analogies involving multiple relations , we have developed a domain - general model of Probabilistic Analogical Mapping ( PAM ) . The model combines graph matching based on an algorithm that performs constraint satisfaction ( similar in spirit to compari son models such as Holyoak & Thagard’s ACME , 1989 , Goldstone’s SIAM , 1994 , and Goldstone & Rogosky’s ABSURDIST , 2002 ) with vector representations of both concepts and relations . PAM operates on semantic relation networks , a type of graph structure in which nodes represent individual concepts and edges represent semantic relations between concepts . ( Note that “concepts” may include nouns , verbs , adjectives and other predicates . ) The semantic relation networks created for each analog ( Figure 1 , middle ) have the form of attributed graphs ( in the terminology of graph matching ; Gold & Rangarajan , 1996 ) , because nodes and edges are assigned numerical attributes , capturing the semantic meanings of individual concepts and their pairwise relations . The attribute for each node is the Word2vec embedding of a key concept word , Probabilistic Analogical Mapping 23 and the attribute for each edge is the corresponding relation / role vector generated by BART ( i . e . , concepts and relations are represented in separate feature spaces ) . Once key concepts have been specified , semantic relation networks representing individual analogs are created in an automated fashion , without hand - coding of either concept meanings or semantic relations . Mapping Based on Semantic Relation Networks Using the semantic relation networks created for the source and target analog , PAM performs analogical mapping using a probabilistic approach ( Gold & Rangarajan , 1996 ) . Source and target analogs can be represented as two graphs of semantic relation networks , 𝑔𝑔 and 𝑔𝑔 ′ , respectively . A semantic relation network for the source analog is defined as an attributed graph < N , E , A > where each node N and each edge E is assigned an attribute A . As applied to verbal analogies , nodes are words for individual concepts and edges are semantic relations between words . Let 𝑖𝑖 and 𝑗𝑗 be indices of nodes in the graph . 𝐴𝐴 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 indicates the semantic attribute of the 𝑖𝑖 th concept , and 𝐴𝐴 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 indicates the relation attribute of the edge between the 𝑖𝑖 th concept and the 𝑗𝑗 th concept . The target analog can be represented as graph 𝑔𝑔′ with 𝑖𝑖′ and 𝑗𝑗′ as indices of nodes in the graph . 𝑀𝑀 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ′ = 1 if the 𝑖𝑖 th concept node in the source analog maps to the 𝑖𝑖 ′ th node in the target analog , and 𝑀𝑀 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ′ = 0 if the two concepts are not mapped . The goal of the model is to estimate the probabilistic mapping matrix m , consisting of elements denoting the probability that the 𝑖𝑖 th node in the source analog maps to the 𝑖𝑖 ′ th node in the target analog , 𝑚𝑚 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ′ = 𝑃𝑃 ( 𝑀𝑀 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ′ = 1 ) . Using a Bayesian approach , given two semantic relation networks , PAM aims to infer a mapping m between concepts in the two analogs so as to maximize its posterior probability with the constraints ∀𝑖𝑖 ∑ 𝑚𝑚 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ′ = 1 , ∀𝑖𝑖 ′ ∑ 𝑚𝑚 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ′ = 1 𝑖𝑖 𝑖𝑖 ′ : 𝑃𝑃 ( 𝒎𝒎 | 𝑔𝑔 , 𝑔𝑔 ′ ) ∝ 𝑃𝑃 ( 𝑔𝑔 , 𝑔𝑔 ′ | 𝒎𝒎 ) 𝑃𝑃 ( 𝒎𝒎 ) . ( 3 ) Probabilistic Analogical Mapping 24 The likelihood term 𝑃𝑃 ( 𝑔𝑔 , 𝑔𝑔 ′ | 𝒎𝒎 ) is determined by the semantic similarity between concepts and relations weighted by mapping probability . We define the log - likelihood as log �𝑃𝑃 ( 𝑔𝑔 , 𝑔𝑔 ′ | 𝒎𝒎 ) � = ∑ ∑ ∑ ∑ 𝑚𝑚 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ′ 𝑚𝑚 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ′ 𝑆𝑆�𝐴𝐴 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , 𝐴𝐴 𝑖𝑖 ′ 𝑖𝑖 ′ � + 𝛼𝛼 ∑ ∑ 𝑚𝑚 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ′ 𝑆𝑆 ( 𝐴𝐴 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , 𝐴𝐴 𝑖𝑖 ′ 𝑖𝑖 ′ ) 𝑖𝑖 ′ 𝑖𝑖 𝑖𝑖 ′ ≠𝑖𝑖 ′ 𝑖𝑖 ′ 𝑖𝑖≠𝑖𝑖 𝑖𝑖 , ( 4 ) where 𝑆𝑆�𝐴𝐴 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , 𝐴𝐴 𝑖𝑖 ′ 𝑖𝑖 ′ � represents the normalized relation similarity between edge attributes of the relation instantiated by the i th and j th concepts in one analog and that instantiated by the 𝑖𝑖 ′ th and 𝑗𝑗 ′ th concepts in the other analog , with the constraints of ∑ 𝑆𝑆�𝐴𝐴 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , 𝐴𝐴 𝑖𝑖 ′ 𝑖𝑖 ′ � 𝑖𝑖 ′ , 𝑖𝑖 ′ = 1 and ∑ 𝑆𝑆�𝐴𝐴 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , 𝐴𝐴 𝑖𝑖 ′ 𝑖𝑖 ′ � 𝑖𝑖 , 𝑖𝑖 = 1 . 𝑆𝑆 ( 𝐴𝐴 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , 𝐴𝐴 𝑖𝑖 ′ 𝑖𝑖 ′ ) represents the normalized similarity between node attributes of individual concepts . The normalization of similarities were implemented using a bistochastic normalization procedure developed by Cour et al . ( 2006 ) . The goal of this normalization procedure is to selectively weight the influences of particular concepts and relations on mapping . Intuitively , this normalization operation decreases the influence of concepts ( nodes ) and relations ( edges ) that are not discriminative ( e . g . , those showing indistinguishable similarity to many concepts / relations in the other analog ) , and correspondingly increases the influences of discriminative concepts and relations ( those showing high similarity scores to a small number of concepts / relations but low similarity scores to other concept / relations in the other analog ) . All similarity scores were calculated using cosine similarity . The parameter 𝛼𝛼 in Equation 4 is a weighting parameter that controls the relative importance of lexical similarity ( nodes ) versus relation similarity ( edges ) on mapping , with higher values indicative of greater emphasis on entity - based lexical similarity in comparison to relation similarity . The 𝛼𝛼 parameter allows PAM to capture psychological evidence that a variety of factors can alter human sensitivity to relation versus entity - based similarity ( Goldstone , Medin , & Gentner , 1991 ; Markman & Gentner , 1993 ; Vendetti , Wu , & Holyoak , 2014 ) . The fundamental assumption is that concepts ( nodes ) and relations ( edges ) constitute two Probabilistic Analogical Mapping 25 separable pools of semantic information ( entity - based and relation - based ) that jointly drive judgments of similarity between analogs . The prior term in Equation 3 captures generic constraints that higher prior probability is assigned to deterministic mappings with the constraints ∀𝑖𝑖 ∑ 𝑚𝑚 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ′ = 1 , ∀𝑖𝑖 ′ ∑ 𝑚𝑚 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ′ = 1 𝑖𝑖 𝑖𝑖 ′ , and is defined with a parameter 𝛽𝛽 to control the strength of the prior as , 𝑃𝑃 ( 𝒎𝒎 ) = 𝑒𝑒 1 𝛽𝛽 ∑ ∑ 𝑚𝑚 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖′ log 𝑚𝑚 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖′ 𝑖𝑖′ 𝑖𝑖 . ( 5 ) To implement the inference in Equation 3 , we employ a graduated assignment algorithm ( Gold & Rangarajan , 1996 ) , variants of which have been applied to matching problems in computer vision ( Lu & Yuille , 2005 ; Menke & Yang , 2020 ) . The algorithm incorporates soft assignments in graph matching . A deterministic one - to - one correspondence constraint requires that a node in one graph must match to one node in the other graph and vice versa , with the mapping values m either 0 or 1 . The graduated assignment algorithm relaxes this constraint by allowing probabilistic mapping values that lie in the continuous range [ 0 , 1 ] . The matching algorithm minimizes the energy function ( equivalent to maximizing the posterior probability defined in Equation 3 ) with respect to the matching matrix : 𝑬𝑬 [ 𝒎𝒎 ] = − ∑ 𝑚𝑚 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ′ 𝑚𝑚 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ′ 𝑆𝑆�𝐴𝐴 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , 𝐴𝐴 𝑖𝑖 ′ 𝑖𝑖 ′ � 𝑖𝑖 , 𝑖𝑖 ′ , 𝑖𝑖 , 𝑖𝑖 ′ − 𝛼𝛼 ∑ 𝑚𝑚 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ′ 𝑆𝑆 ( 𝐴𝐴 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , 𝐴𝐴 𝑖𝑖 ′ 𝑖𝑖 ′ ) − 1 𝛽𝛽 ∑ ∑ 𝑚𝑚 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ′ log 𝑚𝑚 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ′ , 𝑖𝑖 ′ 𝑖𝑖 𝑖𝑖 , 𝑖𝑖 ′ 𝑠𝑠 . 𝑡𝑡 . ∀𝑖𝑖 ∑ 𝑚𝑚 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ′ = 1 , ∀𝑖𝑖 ′ ∑ 𝑚𝑚 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ′ = 1 . 𝑖𝑖 𝑖𝑖 ′ ( 6 ) where 𝛼𝛼 controls the relative weights between lexical similarity of concepts ( node attributes ) and relational similarity ( edge attributes ) . 𝛽𝛽 is a control parameter used to slowly push the values of mapping variables toward either 0 or 1 by applying the softmax function through iterations . An annealing operation with normalization is implemented to gradually increase 𝛽𝛽 over iterations to approximate the one - to - one constraint . In the implementation code , we used a fixed number of Probabilistic Analogical Mapping 26 iterations ( 500 ) for all simulations , which was reliably sufficient to ensure stable mapping solutions . Table 1 provides pseudo - code for the probabilistic mapping algorithm . Table 1 . Pseudo - code for Probabilistic Analogical Mapping ( PAM ) algorithm .

Mappings between similar concepts are favored based on greater semantic similarity of node attributes , and mappings of similar relations are favored based on greater relational similarity of edge attributes . Nodes and Probabilistic Analogical Mapping 27 edges can have varying importance weights , reflecting greater attention to elements important for the analogist’s goals . The preference to move mapping variables toward 0 or 1 with normalization implements a soft assignment of one - to - one mappings between concepts across analogs ( favoring isomorphic mappings ) . Incorporating Relation Constraints Provided by Texts A longstanding ( though unrealized ) goal for models of analogy has been to enable reasoning based on text inputs ( e . g . , Winston , 1980 ) . When given text inputs ( rather than analogies based simply on sets of words ) , PAM makes use of constraints provided by sentence structure . In forming semantic network graphs , PAM can naturally accommodate relation constraints provided by textual descriptions of analogs , by controlling the presence and absence of relation links and their directionality . Because semantic relations are in the general case nonsymmetric , any pair of nodes can be linked by two edges with opposite directions ( e . g . , finger and hand could be linked by an edge directed from the former to the latter representing part - whole , and by an edge directed from the latter to the former representing the converse relation whole - part ) . Depending on the reasoner’s knowledge about the analogs ( as provided by textual information about whether and how particular concepts are related to one another ) , any concept pair in a graph can be connected by zero , one ( unidirectional ) , or two ( bidirectional ) edges . In the simulations reported here , bidirectional links are constructed by default when the analogs consist of a simple set of words ( as in the example depicted in Figure 1 ) . For more complex analogs presented as short texts , we explore the use of NLP techniques to identify keywords ( words used frequently in the text , which correspond to core concepts ) to serve as nodes in each semantic relation graph . For present purposes , we assume only very basic parsing of surface syntax to constrain generation of links . Words that appear close together in a Probabilistic Analogical Mapping 28 text are more likely to be related in some significant way . As a simple heuristic to limit the size of semantic relation networks , we form links only between those keywords that cooccur within the same sentence . Unidirectional links are used to capture the directionality of subject - verb - object ( noun - verb - noun ) expressions . For example , the semantic relation network representing the sentence dog chases cat forms a triangle structure with three unidirectional edges to capture the head - to - tail pairwise relations ( dog → chase , chase → cat , dog → cat ) . This directionality constraint can be applied to any noun - verb - noun structure in a text . We use this directionality constraint for all simulations with text input in the present paper . Though doubtless oversimplified , these heuristics provide a preliminary procedure for using syntactic information conveyed by natural language to guide the construction of semantic relation networks ( though some human intervention is still required ) . The general approach we favor is to extract as much guidance as possible from the surface syntax of text ( without necessarily requiring the generation of more abstract propositional representations ) . We discuss NLP - assisted generation of semantic relation networks in connection with Simulation 5 . Analogical Mapping with PAM Experiment and Simulation 1 : Solving Analogies Based on Multiple Pairwise Relations PAM is able to resolve mapping ambiguities because the model maps concepts across analogs based on patterns of similarity among multiple pairwise relations . Patterns of similarity depend on semantic similarities between individual concepts ( node attributes ) and on relation similarities ( edge attributes ) . We first examined mapping performance in humans and models for analogy problems in which resolving a mapping ambiguity requires integrating multiple relations in each analog : finding mappings between triplets of concepts that form an A : B : C category ordering , e . g . , weapon : gun : rifle and mammal : dog : beagle ( see the example in Figure 1 ) . We Probabilistic Analogical Mapping 29 created 12 Category triplets , and used all possible pairs as analogy problems to run a human experiment with a large sample size . Participants . 1 , 329 participants ( M age = 40 . 40 , SD age = 11 . 98 , age range = [ 18 , 82 ] ; 711 female , 608 male , 6 gender non - binary , 4 gender withheld ; minimum education level of high - school graduation , located in the United States , United Kingdom , Ireland , South Africa , or New Zealand ) were recruited using Amazon Mechanical Turk ( MTurk ; approved , including informed consent procedures , by the UCLA Office of the Human Research Protection Program ) . Of these , 49 participants reported being distracted while completing the task , and their data were therefore excluded from analyses . Materials and Procedure . Each participant completed two triplet analogy problems , one of each of two types . For each problem participants were asked to create a valid analogy by using their mouse to drag each of a set of randomly ordered terms ( e . g . , mammal , beagle , and dog ) to one of the terms in an ordered set ( e . g . , clothing : sweater : turtleneck ) presented in a fixed position on the screen ( see Figure 3A ) . One problem was constructed out of 2 triplets in any order drawn from a pool of 12 ( 132 possible triplet pairs ) , each instantiating an A : B : C category ordering as in the example above ( Category triplets ) . The other problem was constructed out of 2 triplets drawn from a different pool of 12 ( another 132 possible triplet pairs ) , each instantiating a part - whole relation conjoined with an object - location relation ( Part - Object - Location triplets ) . For example , a participant might be asked to match each of fin , fish , and ocean to each of engine : car : garage . The order of the two problems was counterbalanced across participants , and the specific triplets forming each problem were randomly assigned to each participant . By presenting each participant with just one problem of each type , we minimized any opportunity to learn the general structure Probabilistic Analogical Mapping 30 of the problems ( as our focus was on immediate analogical transfer , rather than schema induction ) . All triplets are provided in Supplemental Information , Table S1 . Before solving the two experimental problems , the analogy task was explained using two separate examples ( involving different relations than the experimental problems ) . The instructions specified that an analogy is valid if the relations among the terms in each set match each other . Figure 3A depicts an example trial of the triplet mapping task as it would be performed by a human participant . Triplet Simulations . We ran model simulations for all 132 analogy problems based on Category triplets . We compared the PAM model to several control models by varying relation representations and mapping algorithms . The relation vector was defined either as the concatenation of role and relation vectors created by BART ( see Supplemental Information for additional variants ) , or as the difference of the Word2vec vectors for two words ( Word2vec - diff ) , a standard procedure for forming a generic representation of the semantic relation instantiated by a pair of words ( Zhila et al . , 2013 ) . The mapping algorithm was either the PAM model based on probabilistic mapping , or an alternative procedure based on exhaustive search of all possible mappings to maximize relation similarity . The exhaustive search algorithm represents the structure of a given triplet A : B : C as a concatenation of three vectors representing the pairwise relations between individual terms [ A : B , B : C , A : C ] , and mapped an unordered triplet D , E , F to an ordered triplet A : B : C by finding the concatenated vector for the unordered triplet that yielded the highest cosine similarity to that of the concatenated vector for A : B : C . Note that the exhaustive search algorithm is only practical for relatively small analogy problems such as these triplet analogies , as the number of possible mappings is of the order O ( n ! ) . For example , if an analogy problem involves 10 concepts in each analog , an exhaustive search of possible mappings would involve 3 . 6 Probabilistic Analogical Mapping 31 million possible orders . In contrast , PAM based on probabilistic graduated assignment is much more efficient , with space complexity of O ( n 2 ) . For simulations with PAM , a parameter search for 𝛼𝛼 in Equation 4 found that a value of 0 . 1 yielded the highest mapping accuracy , indicating that accurate mapping in the triplet task requires downweighing the contribution of entity - based lexical similarity . Comparing Human and Model Performance . For each analogy problem with Category triplets , the mapping response was counted as correct in an all - or - none manner : a mapping response was coded as 1 only if all three words were mapped correctly in a problem . Humans achieved mapping performance with average accuracy of 0 . 74 . As shown in Figure 3B , the PAM model ( PAM mapping algorithm coupled with BART ) yielded the highest mapping accuracy of the four alternative models ( 0 . 83 ) , exceeding mean performance of our MTurk participants . The two models using Word2vec - diff relation vectors were clearly inadequate . As reported in Supplemental Information , Table S2 , standard PAM shows superior performance to further control models tested in ablation simulations . Perhaps surprisingly , the PAM model yielded higher accuracy than the exhaustive search model with BART relation vectors ( 0 . 69 ) . The exhaustive search algorithm considers all pairwise relations equally . However , due to the use of the balanced graph matching algorithm ( Cour et al . , 2006 ) , PAM selectively emphasizes those edges that are more distinctive in their similarity pattern . For example , if the relation between nodes i and j in one analog shows high similarity to relations between many paired entities in the other analog , then its relation similarity is not discriminative in signaling the best mapping . In contrast , if the relation between nodes i and j in one analog shows high similarity only to the relation between nodes i’ and j’ in the other analog , and low similarity to relations between other paired entities , then its relation similarity is more informative in Probabilistic Analogical Mapping 32 encouraging PAM to map i to i’ and j to j’ . In general , informative relations have a greater impact on mapping in PAM than do less informative relations , whereas the exhaustive algorithm weights all pairwise relations equally . Thus PAM is not simply a computationally tractable approximation to the exhaustive search algorithm ; rather , PAM can lead to superior mapping performance for some analogy problems . Figure 3 . Model and human results for solving triplet analogies . ( A ) A mapping trial with two triplets of words . Participant must move each of three unordered words in one triplet ( column at left ) below the matching word in another triplet ( top row ) so as to form a valid analogy . ( B ) Simulation results ( predicted proportion of triplet mappings entirely correct ) for Category triplets using four alternative models : coding relations by vectors derived from Word2vec ( difference vectors ) or from BART , with mapping performed either by an exhaustive comparison of concatenated relation vectors or by the PAM algorithm . Human performance is indicated by the dashed line . ( C ) Mapping accuracy for words in the three positions within a triplet for humans and for PAM with BART vectors , separately for Category and Part - Object - Location triplets . Each datapoint for human performance is based on mean accuracy across individual participants who completed a given problem . Error bars indicate ±1 standard error of human accuracy for each word position across individual problems . Probabilistic Analogical Mapping 33 For both problem types , PAM’s proportion correct was modestly higher than that observed for the human data ( 0 . 83 versus 0 . 74 for Category triplets ; 0 . 89 versus 0 . 79 for P art - Object - Location triplets ) , perhaps due to variable effort on the part of the MTurk participants . In order to quantitatively compare predictions of PAM and the model variants to human performance , we conducted item - level analyses . We calculated the root - mean - square deviation ( RMSD ) of model predictions from the corresponding human responses ( all responses scored as 1 for a fully correct mapping , . 5 for a partially correct mapping , and 0 for an incorrect mapping ) on each individual problem spanning both Category and Part - Object - Location triplets . Lower RMSD values indicate a closer match to human performance . The value of RMSD was lower for standard PAM ( . 22 ) than for either a control model without relation representations ( Nodes - only , . 38 ) or a control model with weak relation representations ( Word2vec - diff with either mapping algorithm , . 39 ) . ( For additional model comparisons see Supplemental Information . ) PAM also makes novel predictions regarding the accuracy of mappings at the level of individual word positions , which are predicted to vary across the two triplet types that were tested . As shown in Figure 3C , for Category triplets PAM predicts lowest accuracy for the middle word position ( the intermediate category ) , whereas for Part - Object - Location triplets PAM predicts lowest accuracy for the first word position ( the part ) . ( See Supplemental Information for additional model comparisons . ) Humans show a similar pattern of mapping accuracy at the level of word position in the different analogy problems . A two - way mixed ANOVA for mean human accuracy across problems , using triplet type ( Category versus Part - Object - Location ) as a between - problem factor , and word position ( first vs . middle vs . last ) as a within - problem factor , revealed reliable main effects for triplet type , F ( 1 , 262 ) = 6 . 24 , p = . 013 , and word position , F ( 2 , 524 ) = 3 . 53 , p = . 030 , as well as a reliable interaction , F ( 2 , 524 ) = 17 . 78 , p < . 001 . We followed up with six Probabilistic Analogical Mapping 34 planned pairwise comparisons between word positions within each triplet type . Using a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons , we found that for Category triplets , participants were reliably less accurate in correctly mapping the middle word position ( the intermediate category ) than the first word position ( the superordinate category ) , t ( 131 ) = 4 . 48 , p < . 001 . The accuracy difference between the middle and last word positions ( the subordinate category ) fell short of significance after Bonferroni correction , t ( 131 ) = 2 . 10 , p = . 207 , as did that between the first and last word positions , t ( 131 ) = 2 . 21 , p = . 162 . For Part - Object - Location triplets , participants were least accurate for the first word position ( the part ) : comparing first to middle word position ( the object ) , t ( 131 ) = 3 . 93 ; comparing first to last word position ( the location ) , t ( 131 ) = 5 . 01 , both p ’s < . 001 . Accuracy did not differ between the middle and last word positions , t ( 131 ) = 1 . 57 , p = . 529 . Overall , this set of findings confirms that PAM coupled with BART relation vectors is able to find systematic mappings by inferring and then integrating multiple pairwise relations , yielding mapping performance comparable to that of humans . Simulation 2 : Mapping Science Analogies and Metaphors Analogies play an important role in both the development of scientific theories ( Holyoak & Thagard , 1995 ) and in interpreting everyday metaphors ( Lakoff & Johnson , 2003 ) . It has generally been assumed that mapping such complex systems of knowledge depends directly on propositional representations , often using higher - order relations that take entire propositions as arguments . However , a study by Turney ( 2008 ) showed that people are able to find reasonable mappings for a set of 20 science analogies and analogical metaphors ( Table 2 ) in which each analog has been reduced to 5 - 9 concepts corresponding to keywords , without accompanying texts ( see Supplemental Information ) . These problems are all cross - domain , semantically - distant analogies , such as the Rutherford - Bohr analogy for the atom , or that between a computer and a Probabilistic Analogical Mapping 35 mind . The keywords are a mix of nouns and verbs . For example , the source solar system is paired with the target atom , each represented by seven keywords ( solar system set : solar system , sun , planet , mass , attracts , revolves , and gravity ; atom set : atom , nucleus , electron , charge , attracts , revolves , and electromagnetism ) . To take a second example , the source analog computer includes 9 keywords ( computer , outputs , inputs , bug , processing , erasing , write , read , memory ) , as does the target analog mind ( mind , muscles , senses , mistake , thinking , forgetting , memorize , remember , memory ) . Turney showed that this set of analogies can be solved reliably by a computational model ( Latent Relation Mapping Engine ) that searches large text corpora for relation words associated with each keyword , and then uses frequencies of co - occurrence as an index of relational similarity . Turney also asked 22 human participants to map words between source and target analogs , and assessed human performance in this mapping task for each problem . Table 2 .

Model and human performance for solving 10 science analogies and 10 analogical metaphors in a dataset developed by Turney ( 2008 ) . Numbers correspond to analogies listed in Table 2 ( ordered from highest to lowest human accuracy within each type ) . Each problem includes 5 - 9 keywords in source and target analogs ( numbers are provided in Table 2 ) . Mapping accuracy is defined as the proportion of keywords correctly mapped . We applied PAM to this dataset of 10 science analogy problems and 10 analogical metaphors . In Simulation 2 , PAM formed semantic relation networks for each analog , with node attributes coded as Word2vec vectors for each word , and edge attributes coded as BART vectors for all pairwise relations . It is important to note that none of the word pairs in these materials had been used to train the BART model . This simulation thus provides a strong test of generalization for relation identification , based on the distributed representations of relations created by BART . Figure 4 depicts human and PAM mapping accuracy for each problem . Across the 20 analogies , the PAM model achieved a mean accuracy of 8 5 % in identifying correct corresponden ces of keywords between two analogs , approaching the 88 % accuracy observed in Turney ' s ( 2008 ) experiment with adult human participants ( though less than the 92 % accuracy achieved by Turney’s LRME model ) . Trends for individual problems showed higher mapping accuracy for PAM over humans for 10 problems , humans over PAM for 9 , with one tie . For the Probabilistic Analogical Mapping 37 computer / mind analogy , PAM yielded correct mappings between all corresponding words across the two analogs ( computer to mind , outputs to muscles , inputs to senses , bug to mistake , etc . ) . Several model variants were also tested ( see Supplemental Information ) . Given that the analogs used in Simulation 2 are based solely on keywords , without any support from structured text , it is reasonable to consider whether performance of the full PAM model was driven solely by the semantics of the keywords themselves . In general , PAM’s performance was fairly similar across model variants . However , overall accuracy was reduced if edge similarity was excluded ( Nodes - only , 77 % ) , or if Word2vec - diff was used instead of BART to create relation vectors ( Word2vec - diff , 77 % ) . Hence PAM’s performance depended in part on BART’s relation vectors . The standard PAM model correctly predicts lower mapping accuracy for the 10 science analogy problems ( 0 . 79 ) than for the 10 analogical metaphor problems ( 0 . 90 ) , consistent with the difference observed for humans ( 0 . 85 for science analogy problems and 0 . 91 for analogical metaphor problems ) . The model variant without relations ( Nodes - only ) did not show this difference ( . 78 accuracy for science analogy problems and . 77 for analogical metaphor problems ) . Accuracy remained high ( 0 . 85 ) for the BART - role variant , in which the edge vectors included only the role component . Recall that for each relation in BART’s vector , the role component is jointly determined by the relation and by semantic features of the keyword playing the first role of the relation . Thus although relation information played a significant role in PAM’s performance , semantic features of keywords were certainly influential . Simulation 3 : Pragmatic Influences on Mapping Some analogies pose mapping ambiguities that cannot be resolved simply by integrating the available relations , because the relations themselves support multiple potential mappings about equally . For example , when people were asked to draw analogies between the actors in the first Probabilistic Analogical Mapping 38 Gulf War ( in 1991 ) and those in World War II , the American President George H . W . Bush paired with United States was sometimes mapped to Franklin Roosevelt and the United States , and sometimes to Winston Churchill and Great Britain ( as all three pairs instantiate the relation “wartime leader of nation” ; Spellman & Holyoak , 1992 ) . Individual participants tended to choose one or the other of the two mappings that were pairwise consistent , with a significant number choosing each . Pairs were almost always mapped consistently ( i . e . , people seldom mapped Bush to Roosevelt but the United States to Great Britain ) . Although people clearly prefer isomorphic ( one - to - one ) mappings , they must cope with naturalistic situations of this sort that have considerable relational overlap ( as well as similarities between individual objects ) , but that are not in fact isomorphic . In such cases people sometimes give responses that violate a strict one - to - one constraint ( e . g . , about 7 % of participants mapped the United States of the Gulf War era onto both the United States of World War II and also Great Britain ) . In several experiments using non - isomorphic analogies , a minority of participants produced one - to - many or ( more often ) many - to - one mappings ( Spellman & Holyoak , 1992 , 1996 ; Krawczyk , Holyoak , & Hummel , 2004 ) . Such findings are consistent with mapping models such as PAM ( also ACME , Holyoak & Thagard , 1989 , and LISA , Hummel & Holyoak , 1997 ) that treat isomorphism as a soft constraint , rather than a strict filter on possible mappings . Probabilistic Analogical Mapping 39 Figure 5 . Semantic relation networks for story analogs from Spellman and Holyoak ( 1996 , Experiment 2 ) . Particularly when analogs are in fact non - isomorphic , a preferred mapping may be determined by pragmatic factor s , notably the reasoner’s goal in using the analogy ( Holyoak , 1985 ) . In PAM , prior beliefs about probable analogical correspondences , and preferences for correspondences based on goal - related elements , can be represented by varying attention weights ( Nosof sky , 1986 ) on relevant nodes and edges ( reflecting relative attention to different components of analogs ) . In Simulation 3 , PAM was applied to a set of non - isomorphic story analogies used in a study by Spellman and Holyoak ( 1996 , Experiment 2 ) . Each analog was a science - fiction - style description of multiple countries . The countries on each of two planets ( forming the source and target analogs ) were linked by various economic and / or military alliances , such that the country Barebrute on one planet could be mapped to either the country Hungerall on the second planet based on a shared economic relation ( summarized by the predicate aid - economic ) , or to Millpower based on a shared military relation ( aid - military ; see schematic description in Figure 5 ) . In these stories , similarities were balanced so that the mapping for Barebrute was ambiguous , as country Barebrute on Planet 1 had equal similarity to the countries Hungerall and Millpower on Planet 2 . Probabilistic Analogical Mapping 40 In the human experiment , manipulations of participants’ processing goals guided their preferred mappings : stressing the importance of either economic factors or Hungerall encouraged the Barebrute— > Hungerall mapping relative to the Barebrute— > Millpower mapping , whereas stressing either military factors or Millpower encouraged the Barebrute— > Millpower mapping relative to the Barebrute— > Hungerall mapping . PAM was provided with a set of concepts for each analog . As shown in Figure 5 , the source analog included 9 concepts ( Afflu , Barebrute , Compak , rich , poor , strong , weak , aid - economic , aid - military ) , and the target analog included 10 concepts ( Grainwell , Hungerall , Millpower , Mightless , rich , poor , strong , weak , aid - economic , aid - military ) . Note that the predicates aid - economic and aid - military were included as nodes . The Word2vec vector for country was assigned to all the imaginary countries used in both analogs ( hence node similarity could not discriminate among the possible mappings for any country ) . To simulate the pragmatic impact of goals on mapping the ambiguous country ( Barebrute ) , attention weights were increased on the relations relevant to a particular goal . In the condition stressing the importance of Hungerall , all pairwise relations involving Hungerall , including its relation to Grainwell via aid - economic , were assigned attention weights . In the condition stressing economic factors , the relation between Grainwell and rich was also emphasized . Complementary sets of relations were assigned attention weights to model the conditions emphasizing the country Millpower or military factors . During each simulation run , PAM sampled the value of its attention weight from a uniform distribution within the range of [ 1 , 1 . 1 ] . The left panel in Figure 6 shows the proportion of trials on which humans selected Hungerall or else Millpower as the preferred mapping for the ambiguous country Barebrute across different conditions . The right panel in Figure 6 shows the probability that PAM selected each preferred mapping ( obtained by averaging 1000 samples of Probabilistic Analogical Mapping 41 attention weights for each experimental condition ) . In the simulation of the control condition ( equal emphasis ) , PAM predicts that the ambiguous country Barebrute will be mapped to Hungerall and Millpower with equal probability . Although PAM does not include an explicit decision mechanism for dealing with such ambiguous mappings , it would be reasonable to expect that a reasoner would either provide both correspondences or report just one of the two ( chosen randomly ) . In Spellman and Holyoak’s ( 1996 ) experiment , about half of human participants in the control condition mapped both Hungerall and Millpower to Barebrute , so many - to - one mappings are certainly observed . Figure 6 . Human responses ( Spellman & Holyoak , 1996 , Experiment 2 ) and PAM predictions in Simulation 3 , based on the probability of mapping the ambiguous country Barebrute to either Hungerall ( based on similar economic relations ) or Millpower ( based on similar military relations ) for different experimental conditions . When attention weights are used to emphasize particular goals , PAM predicts the qualitative shift in the preferred mapping for Barebrute . Given emphasis on Hungerall or economic factors , Barebrute is more likely mapped to Hungerall ; given emphasis on Millpower or military factors , Barebrute is more likely mapped to Millpower . It is also noteworthy that PAM captures an asymmetry in the impact of goals on mapping . Both in the human data and in PAM’s predictions , the impact of emphasis on Hungerall or economic factors yields a smaller shift in mappings relative to an emphasis on Millpower or military factors . This asymmetry emerges even Probabilistic Analogical Mapping 42 though PAM models the economic and military goals using exactly symmetrical shifts in attention weights . This asymmetry arises from subtle differences in the semantic similarities among keywords ( nodes ) , which are inherited from the Word2vec embeddings that encodes semantic meanings of individual concepts : economic shows more similar semantic associations to several alternative keywords ( poor , rich , weak , strong ) than does military . These semantic differences render the military - related keywords more distinctive ( resulting in less ambiguous mappings ) , and hence more resistant to displacement when competing with economic - based mappings than vice versa . When model variants were examined , this asymmetry disappeared in the variant that excluded node similarities ( BART edges - only ) , confirming that keywords similarities drove the effect ( see Supplemental Information ) . Edge similarities were certainly critical to the overall performance of the model , as the variant that omitted edge similarities ( Nodes - only ) was completely unable to capture the pattern of human mapping judgments . The Word2vec - diff model was unable to run at all because of issues arising from the identical node vectors ( for the word country ) assigned to all the imaginary countries . Only the full PAM model , which fully integrates rich semantics of concepts and relations into the mapping process , can account for the fine - grained aspects of human judgments . Simulation 4 : Modeling the Relational Shift in Cognitive Development Developmental research has shown that children’s ability to reason and solve problems by analogy generally improves with age ( Holyoak , Junn , & Billman , 1984 ) . Over the course of cognitive development , children undergo a relational shift ( Gentner & Rattermann , 1991 ) from a primary focus on direct similarity of objects towards greater reliance on relational information . As noted previously , a variety of factors are known to globally shift the balance between the impact Probabilistic Analogical Mapping 43 of semantic similarity of individual concepts versus relational similarity on comparison judgments . Relational similarity tends to be more potent when overall relational similarity across analogs is relatively high ( Goldstone et al . , 1991 ) , when the objects in visual analogs are sparse rather than rich ( Gentner & Rattermann , 1991 ; Markman & Gentner , 1993 ) , and when participants are given more time to make their judgments ( Goldstone & Medin , 1994 ) . From the perspective of PAM such global factors , including the relational shift , can potentially be captured by variations in the parameter 𝛼𝛼 in Equation 6 . As a test of whether PAM can account for developmental changes in analogy performance , we simulated findings from a classic developmental study by Gentner and Toupin ( 1986 ) . In this study children used toys to enact interactions among three animal characters , using actions familiar to young children ( e . g . , playing ) . The experimenter guided the children to act out the events in the source story , and then asked them to repeat the same events using different characters in a target analog . Using variants of the same basic stories , a 2x2 design was created to manipulate systematicity of the source analog and compatibility 1 of the mappings between source and target characters . In one example , the source text was a short passage describing interactions among a seal , penguin , and dog . The introduction to the systematic version stated that the seal was jealous and did not want his friend the penguin to play with anyone else . The story ended by stating the moral that it is wrong to be jealous and better to have more friends . In the nonsystematic version the introduction described the seal as “strong” rather than “jealous” , and the moral was omitted . The body of the story was identical in the two versions , describing how the penguin played with the dog , angering the seal , but how the dog eventually saved the seal from danger . Thus in the systematic version the seal’s jealousy had an intuitive connection to his anger and behavior , which the nonsystematic version lacked . Gen tner and Toupin ( 1986 ) hypothesized that the systematic Probabilistic Analogical Mapping 44 version was richer in higher - order relations ( in particular , the relation cause , presumed to hold between propositions ) . The target analog also involved three animal characters . In the high compatibility condition three animals , each similar to one of the source characters , played corresponding roles : < seal , penguin , dog > maps to < walrus , seagull , cat > . High compatibility between relational roles and object similarity makes mapping straightforward . In the low compatibility condition the same animals were assigned to different roles , creating cross mappings between roles and object similarity : < seal , penguin , dog > maps to < seagull , cat , walrus > . Such cross mappings , in which the tendency to match relational roles competes with a preference to match similar objects , create difficulty for children and even for adults ( Markman & Gentner , 1993 ) . Finally , in the medium compatibility condition the three animals to be mapped were < lion , giraffe , camel > , which have no particular similarity to animals in the other analog . The medium compatibility condition was thus neutral with respect to mappings between relational roles and animals . Probabilistic Analogical Mapping 45 Figure 7 . PAM simulation of character mapping by children of different ages ( top ) and children’s accuracy in reenacting stories ( bottom ; reprinted by permission from Gentner & Toupin , 1986 ) . A , top : Mapping accuracy with node attributes weighted with = 2 ; bottom , data for 4 - 6 year old children . B , top : Mapping accuracy with node attributes weighted with 𝛼𝛼 = 1 ; bottom , data for 8 - 10 year old children . Gentner and Toupin ( 1986 ) tested groups of younger ( 4 - 6 years ) and older ( 8 - 10 years ) children , scoring each child on accuracy in reenacting the story using the target characters . Children in both groups performed best when the source was systematic and the character mapping was highly compatible . Accuracy was impaired when the source was nonsystematic and when compatibility was low . The overall advantage of the systematic analogs was attributed to the presence of higher - order ( causal ) relations that participate in the mapping . For the younger children , systematicity was less beneficial overall than it was for the older children , and the detrimental impact of cross mappings ( low compatibility ) was greater . These findings were Probabilistic Analogical Mapping 46 interpreted in terms of a relational shift , such that the older children were less influenced by object similarity and guided more by relational information ( especially higher - order relations ) . The PAM simulation provides a qualitative approximation to the experiment with children ( using mapping accuracy as an estimate of accuracy in story reenactment ) . Simulations were based on eight different sets of animal triplets used in the experiment ( see Supplemental Information for materials and also additional model comparisons ) . The keyword concepts used as input to PAM were drawn from the introduction to the stories : three animals and the verb play . These keywords were shared across the systematic and unsystematic conditions . The only difference between the inputs for the two versions was that the systematic version included the adjective jealous as a keyword , whereas the substituted adjective strong was not included as a keyword for the unsystematic version . Jealous was selected as a keyword because it occurs twice in the systematic version ( both in the introduction and the concluding moral ) , whereas strong occurs only once in the unsystematic version . This selection was confirmed by running two different NLP algorithms on the stories ( a program developed by Tixier , Skianis , & Vazirgiannis , 2016 , and the MATLAB TextRank keyword extraction function ) . Both algorithms identified jealous but not strong as a keyword . More generally , we hypothesize that high systematicity reflects greater text coherence ( Kintsch , 1988 ) , for which keyword extraction provides a simple proxy . Notably , PAM was not provided with any information about higher - order relations for either the systematic or unsystematic versions . To distinguish the syntactic subject and object roles in noun - verb - noun sentences , PAM uses unidirectional edges . In this simulation , given a sentence stating that one animal plays with another ( e . g . , seal plays penguin ) , the forward edge only was created for the three constituent pairwise relations ( seal : play , play : penguin , seal : penguin ) . These single forward edges capture Probabilistic Analogical Mapping 47 the directionality of the syntactic subject and object roles associated with the verb . For example , given the source analog seal plays penguin , PAM will give a higher mapping score for the potential target analog walrus plays seagull than for the cross - mapped source analog seagull plays walrus , yielding a positive effect of compatibility . We manipulated the parameter 𝛼𝛼 in Equation 6 , which controls the impact of lexical similarity ( nodes ) in mapping . PAM compared mapping performance when lexical similarity was given a high weight ( Figure 7A , top , 𝛼𝛼 = 2 ) to performance when this weight was lower ( Figure 7B , top , 𝛼𝛼 = 1 ) . Greater weight on node attributes increases the impact on analogical mapping of similarity between animals in the source and target relative to the impact of semantic relations ( edge attributes ) , simulating the lesser sensitivity to relation similarity for preschool children . As shown in Figure 7 , the PAM simulation captures important trends in development of ability in analogical reasoning : the overall benefit of both source systematicity and mapping compatibility , the interaction between these two factors , as well as greater sensitivity to systematicity for older children . PAM’s simulation demonstrates that the impact of systematicity on analogical mapping , at least in the study by Gentner and Toupin ( 1986 ) , can be explained w ithout requiring any assumptions about the use of higher - order relations . With respect to the relational shift , theorists have suggested that the developmental increase in focus on relations may reflect some mix of increased relational knowledge and maturation of important executive processes , notably working memory and inhibitory control ( Morrison , Doumas , & Richland , 2011 ; Richland , Morrison , & Holyoak , 2006 ) . To model changes in reasoning abilities of the 4 - 6 year versus 8 - 10 year old children , PAM holds constant both knowledge of relations ( with no higher - order relations being used at either age ) and the basic mapping algorithm . Instead , PAM simply manipulates its parameter 𝛼𝛼 , controlling the relative Probabilistic Analogical Mapping 48 influence of relation versus object similarity on mapping . PAM thus instantiates the hypothesis that with increasing age , children come to preferentially place greater weight on relations when reasoning by analogy . This account is consistent with more recent proposals about the development of analogical reasoning , which attribute some performance differences among children to learned ( possibly culturally - dependent ) preferences for relations versus objects , rather than differences in either prior knowledge or processing ability ( Richland , Chan , Morrison , & Au , 2010 ; Kuwabara & Smith , 2012 ; Carstensen , Zhang , Heyman , Fu , Lee , & Walker , 2019 ; also see Kroupin & Carey , 2021 ) . More generally , the relational shift is very likely the product of multiple types of developmental changes . Simulation 5 : Mapping Richer Text Representations PAM can potentially map more complex analogies presented as texts . As an initial effort , we applied the model to find mappings between a source story and target problem introduced by Gick and Holyoak ( 1980 ) and widely used in psychological research on analogical problem solving . The source story ( The General ) describes how a general sends small groups of soldiers down multiple roads to capture a fortress located in the center of a country ; the target ( radiation problem ) describes a doctor attempting to use a kind of ray to destroy an inoperable stomach tumor without damaging healthy tissue . The analogous convergence solution to the radiation problem is to use multiple weak rays directed at the tumor ( Duncker , 1945 ) . The two analogs are not isomorphic , and not all concepts have clear mappings . The texts for the two analogs ( Supplemental Information , Table S7 ) consisted of 13 sentences constituting the problem statement for The General and 7 sentences constituting the radiation problem . Keywords and semantic relations were identified using an NLP - assisted procedure . After replacing pronouns with their antecedents , each text was passed through a Probabilistic Analogical Mapping 49 customized text pre - processing code with the following four steps : ( 1 ) the top 20 most frequent words were selected ; ( 2 ) the MATLAB TextRank keyword extraction function was run to select nouns , adjectives , and verbs included in the top 20 high - frequency word set ; ( 3 ) the MATLAB bag - of - n - grams model with the window size of 2 - gram was used to identify pairwise relations between the keywords ; ( 4 ) noun - noun relations were selected only when both nouns appeared in the same sentence . The procedure for keyword extraction and pairwise relation pre - processing yielded 14 keywords for The General story ( country , dictator , fortress , villages , commander , large , army , capture , roads , landmines , attack , small , many , troops ) and 10 keywords for the radiation problem ( doctor , tumor , patient , destroyed , ray , high , intensity , destroy , healthy , tissue ) . To avoid extreme heteronyms , the word general was replaced by commander and mines were replaced by landmines . Given their near synonymy , troops was replaced by army in forming pairwise relations . We then manually added an important noun - verb - noun relation to each representation , “commander controls army” and “doctor uses rays” . Although not directly stated in the texts , both are obvious inferences . As in previous simulations , unidirectional edges were used to code noun - verb - noun relations . The NLP - assisted text pre - processing thus yielded the basic elements for representing the analogs . Semantic relation networks were created for each analog , with Word2vec embeddings providing node attributes for individual keywords , and BART vectors providing edge attributes for semantic relations between keywords . Figure 8 shows the major correspondences between concepts that PAM identified for the two analogs . Seven concepts have mappings for which humans generally agree : army  ray , fortress  tumor , commander  doctor , country  patient , large  high , capture  destroy , controls  uses ) . PAM identifies all seven of these major mappings , and also maps attack to destroy . According to human intuition , a few concepts in The General have no clear match in the Probabilistic Analogical Mapping 50 radiation problem ( e . g . , dictator , landmines , roads ) . Because PAM aims to find mappings for all concepts , these poorly - matched concepts end up in arbitrary pairings . Figure 8 . Semantic relation networks for The General story and the radiation problem , with mappings created by PAM that link major concepts . ( To avoid clutter some keywords are omitted . ) We performed additional simulations using variant models ( see Supplemental Information ) . In particular , we sought to confirm that PAM’s mapping performance is not solely due to the structure of its semantic relation networks , but also depends on the content of the relation vectors . When relation vectors produced by BART were replaced with Word2vec - diff vectors ( while holding constant all other operations in the mapping algorithm ) , only two of the seven major correspondences between concepts were recovered . Accuracy was also reduced when the full PAM model was ablated to include only node similarities ( Nodes - only , four correct correspondences ) or only edge attributes ( BART edges - only , three correct ) . Thus PAM’s performance critically depends on having effective representations of semantic relations as edge attributes , and not solely on the form of its semantic relation networks . Probabilistic Analogical Mapping 51 Simulations 6 and 7 : Selection of Plausible Source Analogs As noted earlier , mapping is considered central to analogical reasoning because it impacts other key processes , including the initial retrieval of a potentially useful source analog . Memory retrieval involves a process of comparing a cue to cases stored in long - term memory ; although it seems unlikely that a cue could be mapped to every stored case , several models of analog retrieval have proposed that some form of mapping can be performed on a smaller set of “finalists” that pass some basic threshold of similarity ( Forbus et al . , 1995 ; Hummel & Holyoak , 1997 ; Thagard et al . , 1990 ) . Indeed , analog retrieval appears to be sensitive to the same basic constraints as analogical mapping : similarity of individual concepts and of relations , modulated by differential attention to goal - relevant elements . However , retrieval and mapping are at least partially dissociable . Gick and Holyoak ( 1980 , 1983 ) showed that people often fail to retrieve a potentially useful far analog , suggesting retrieval is more difficult than mapping when the analogs are semantically distant . Later studies confirmed this pattern ( Gentner , Rattermann , & Forbus , 1993 ; Holyoak & Koh , 1987 ; Keane , 1987 ; Ross , 1987 , 1989 ; Seifert , McKo on , Abelson , & Ratcliffe , 1986 ) . Other studies found that people produce far source analogs in response to a target more often when the pragmatic context involves a goal of communicating ideas to others ( e . g . , political argumentation ; Blanchette & Dunbar , 2000 , 2001 ) . However , in the latter studies the relative number of near and far potential analogs actually available in memory was unknown . When relative availability is taken into account , studies using naturalistic paradigms also find that analog retrieval is heavily influenced by similarity of individual concepts ( Trench & Minervino , 2015 ) . At the same time , experimental evidence indicates that relational similarity also impacts retrieval ( Wharton et al . , 1994 ; Wharton , Holyoak , & Lange , 1996 ) . Probabilistic Analogical Mapping 52 Analog retrieval , of course , is simply one manifestation of the normal operation of memory processes . The problem of finding a “useful” source analog in response to a target analog can be considered as a special case of a rational analysis of memory ( Anderson & Milson , 1989 ) . Given a set of potential sources S stored in memory , the probability that S i is the optimal candidate for retrieval given some target 2 analog T will be proportional to the prior probability that S i is optimal multiplied by the likelihood that S i is optimal given T . The prior will favor source analogs that have been useful in the past ; hence highly familiar sources will tend to be preferentially retrieved . A particularly well - established example is the prevalent use by children of the “person” concept as a source in making inferences about other animals and plants ( Inagaki & Hatano , 1987 ) . Similarly , people understand new individuals by spontaneously relating them to significant others , such as a parent or close friend ( Andersen , Classman , Chen , & Cole , 1995 ) . Analogical access , like memory retrieval in general , is inherently competitive . Studies have shown that for any cue , people are more likely to retrieve a case from long - term memory if it is the best match available ( based on similarity of both concepts and relations ) than if some other stored case provides a better match ( Wharton et al . , 1994 , 1996 ) . Retrieval involves competition between multiple potential source analogs , whereas mapping focuses on a single source . Also , during mapping information about both analogs can be actively processed in working memory , enabling eduction of relations to create or elaborate semantic relation networks . In contrast , source analogs are necessarily dormant in long - term memory prior to being retrieved . In terms of PAM , encoding a source analog would involve storage of all or part of a semantic relation graph . Storage of concepts and relations will be inherently asymmetrical : concepts A and B ( nodes in a graph ) may be stored without necessarily storing the relation A : B , whereas A : B ( the edge between A and B ) can only be stored if A and B are also stored . Since Probabilistic Analogical Mapping 53 retrieval of far analogs will be relatively dependent on shared relations , retrieval of far versus near analogs will be disadvantaged to the extent important semantic relations in the source were not fully encoded into memory . As this analysis predicts , domain experts ( who are more likely to focus on relevant relations during both encoding and retrieval ) are more successful than novices in accessing remote source analogs based on relational similarity ( Novick , 1988 ; Novick & Holyoak , 1991 ; Goldwater , Gentner , LaDue , & Libarkin , 2021 ) . Given that semantic relation networks have been stored in long - term memory , PAM can be used to calculate a measure of overall similarity—a “mapping score” , which is the log - likelihood defined in Equation 4 using the maximum a posteriori estimate of mapping 𝒎𝒎� inferred by the model . We term this measure the G score : G = ∑ ∑ ∑ ∑ 𝑚𝑚� 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ′ 𝑚𝑚� 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ′ 𝑆𝑆�𝐴𝐴 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , 𝐴𝐴 𝑖𝑖 ′ 𝑖𝑖 ′ � + 𝛼𝛼 ∑ ∑ 𝑚𝑚� 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ′ 𝑆𝑆 ( 𝐴𝐴 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , 𝐴𝐴 𝑖𝑖 ′ 𝑖𝑖 ′ ) 𝑖𝑖 ′ 𝑖𝑖 𝑖𝑖 ′ ≠𝑖𝑖 ′ 𝑖𝑖 ′ 𝑖𝑖≠𝑖𝑖 𝑖𝑖 . ( 7 ) G provides an overall assessment of similarity based on both concept similarity ( node attributes ) and relational similarity ( edge attributes ) . This mapping score can be used to rank alternative source analogs in degree of fit to a target . 3 We report two simulations to illustrate the use of mapping scores to predict analog retrieval . Simulation 6 aimed to demonstrate that PAM can account for the often - observed dissociation between the impact of concept similarity on retrieval versus mapping . Keane ( 198 7 , Experiment 1 ) examined retrieval of several variations of source analogs to the radiation problem ( see Simulation 5 ) . The source analog was always presented as a story , which was studied 1 - 3 days before presentation of the target radiation pr oblem . Keane found that 88 % of participants retrieved a source analog from the same domain as the target ( a story about a surgeon treating a brain tumor ) , whereas only 12 % retrieved a source from a remote domain ( a story about a general capturing a fortress , very similar to that used by Gick & Holyoak , 1980 ) . This difference in ease of access was Probabilistic Analogical Mapping 54 dissociable from the ease of post - access mapping and inference : the frequency of generating the convergence solution to the radiation problem once the source analog was cued was high and equal ( about 86 % ) regardless of whether the source analog was from the same or a different domain . The source texts used by Keane ( 1987 ) were very similar to those examined in Simulation 5 , but shorter and simpler . For the military story ( far source analog ) our text pre - processing program yielded six keywords ( commander , fortress , army , country , destroy , large ) ; for the medical story ( near analog ) the program yielded seven keywords ( surgeon , cancer , rays , brain , destroy , high , intensity ) . The radiation problem ( target ) yielded 10 keywords . We ran PAM the same way as reported in Simulation 5 . PAM found the correct mapping of core concepts for both source stories : commander  doctor , fortress  tumor and army  rays for the far source ; and surgeon  doctor , cancer  tumor and rays  rays for the near source . However , the value of the G score was substantially higher for the near source ( 2 . 216 ) than for the far source ( 1 . 665 ) . Simulation 6 thus captures the qualitative pattern of human performance : higher probability of retrieving a near than far source , coupled with equal ( and high ) success in mapping either to the target . In Simulation 7 we examined PAM’s predictions for analog retrieval using a larger dataset . Turney’s ( 2008 ) dat aset of 20 science analogies and analogical metaphors ( used in Simulation 2 ) provides a test of PAM’s ability to identify “good” source analogs for a given target analog . The mapping score G can be used to rank order any number of potential source analogs in degree of fit to a given target . To assess the ability of PAM to rank potential source analogs , in Simulation 7 the 20 examples of analogies in Table 2 were used to create a source selection task . For this simulation , we assume that the semantic relation networks for all 20 source analogs have been successfully stored in long - term memory , and that the semantic relation for a given target analog Probabilistic Analogical Mapping 55 serves as a retrieval cue . For example , given atom ( # 1 ) as the target analog , we would expect solar system to be selected as the best source analog among the 20 alternatives . For this computational experiment , each target analog in turn was mapped to all 20 source analogs , and PAM’s mapping score was obtained for each potential source . For 17 out of the 20 targets , the best match as computed by PAM was the intended source shown in Table 2 . For the three target analogs in which PAM’s mapping score did not identify the expected source analog , the “errors” proved to be very reasonable . The science analogy dataset includes target analogs that are closely linked to multiple relevant sources . Specifically , two of the science analogies involved gravity ( # 1 and # 6 in Table 1 ) , two involved wave motion ( # 3 and # 5 ) , and two involved heat ( # 4 and # 8 ) . PAM assessed the best ma tch for planetary motion ( # 6 ) to be solar system ( # 1 ) , a source analog based on essentially the same knowledge ( with overlapping keywords ) . The best match for the target sound waves ( # 3 ) was the source sound waves ( # 5 , with somewhat different keywords ) , and the best match for heat due to molecular motion ( # 8 ) was the source combustion ( # 4 ) . These choices indicate that PAM favors retrieval of near over far analogs , as do humans . In each of these cases PAM selected the intended source shown in Table 2 ( a far analog ) as the next - best match . For the target light waves ( # 5 ) the expected source ( sound waves ) was selected as the best match , with the other available wave analog ( water waves , # 3 ) ranked second . Figure 9 shows the entire distribution of G scores across the 20 alternative source analogs for each of four representative target analogs . Probabilistic Analogical Mapping 56 Figure 9 . Representative examples , for each of four target analogs , of the distribution of G scores across 20 alternative source analogs . Each panel shows scores for one target in Turney’s ( 2008 ) dataset ; the horizontal axis indicates 20 possible source analogs ( labels identified in Table 2 ) . A : respiration correctly and unambiguously maps to combustion ; B : sound waves map to sound waves ( very near analog ) closely followed by water waves ( intended far analog ) ; C : argument following correctly and unambiguously maps to path following ; D : reasons for a theory maps correctly to grounds for a building , followed closely by two alternative source analogs . For each target analog , PAM’s measure of mapping quality thus identified relationally - similar source analogs from semantically - distant domains . The results of Simulation 7 indicate that when a semantic relation network has been stored in long - term memory for each analog in a set of potential source analogs , PAM can select a useful source for a given target from among a larger pool of candidates . Of course , if the semantic relation networks for source analogs were poorly encoded or have been degraded by forgetting , retrieval will be less sensitive to shared relations . Probabilistic Analogical Mapping 57 General Discussion Summary and Implications We have presented a novel Bayesian model of analogical mapping , PAM , which builds on advances in machine learning that automate the generation of rich semantics for both concepts ( by Word2vec ) and relations ( by BART trained using Word2vec ) . From these inputs , the model creates semantic relation networks that capture the skeletal structure of complex analogs . PAM operates on semantic relation networks to find mappings between key concepts . The model automatically creates relation networks by integrating fragmentary semantic knowledge about individual concepts and the relations that link them , guided by textual constraints when available . PAM is able to solve analogies that require integration of multiple relations in each analog ( Simulation 1 , based on data from a novel mapping task ) , matching the pattern of human performance in considerable detail . The model is also able to solve complex analogical mappings based on sets of predefined keywords ( Simulation 2 , based on Turney , 2008 ) , and can account for the impact of goals in resolving ambiguous mappings ( Simulation 3 , based on Spellman & Holyoak , 1996 ) . By varying the model’s global emphasis on lexical concept ( node ) versus relation ( edge ) similarity , it is possible to account for developmental shift in sensitivity to relations ; in addition , the model can capture the influence of text coherence ( systematicity ) without assuming access to higher - order propositions ( Simulation 4 , based on Gentner & Toupin , 1986 ) . By adding NLP - assisted pre - processing to extract key concepts from text inputs , the model can solve analogies between non - isomorphic problems posed in short texts ( Simulation 5 , based on Gick & Holyoak , 1980 ) . The model also provides a measure of global similarity between analogs , which Probabilistic Analogical Mapping 58 can be applied to support the retrieval of plausible source analogs from memory , and accounts for the partial dissociation between the impact of different types of similarity on retrieval versus mapping ( Simulation 6 , based on Keane , 1987 ; Simulation 7 , based on Turney , 2008 ) . The use of semantic relation networks in analogical mapping is consistent with empirical evidence that human memory and comprehension are reconstructive in nature , and heavily dependent on prior semantic knowledge ( Kintsch , 1988 ; Van Overschelde & Healy , 2001 ) . PAM captures the human ability to reason by analogy in a domain - general manner , without requiring extensive training with analogy problems in any particular domain . The model’s success in accounting for a range of phenomena observed in studies of human analogical mapping , as well as analog retrieval , illustrates how distributed representations capturing rich semantics of concepts and relations can effectively accomplish tasks that are usually associated with symbolic reasoning ( Carstensen & Frank , 2021 ; Holyoak & Lu , 2021 ) . PAM represents the continuing evolution over the past four decades of models of human analogical mapping based on representation matching . An early hypothesis was that mapping is based solely on structure and not on content ( Gentner , 19 83 ) ; however , empirical evidence led subsequent computational models to add constraints based on semantic content and pragmatic factors ( e . g . , Gentner et al . , 1993 ; Forbus et al . , 2017 ; Holyoak , 1985 ; Holyoak & Thagard , 1989 ) . In PAM , not only individual concepts ( nodes in a semantic relation graph ) but also semantic relations themselves ( edges ) are defined by rich semantic vectors . As demonstrated in comparisons between the performance of PAM using relation vectors generated by BART versus Word2vec - diff , mapping performance can differ radically depending on semantic content even when the form ( structure ) of the semantic relation networks being compared is held constant ( see model comparisons in Supplemental Information , especially for Simulations 1 and 5 ) . In general , for the Probabilistic Analogical Mapping 59 simulations reported here , PAM approaches human levels of performance only when it operates on relation vectors provided by BART . The present computational results are in accord with previous evidence that BART , but not Word2vec - diff , generates semantic relation vectors that can account for human patterns of relational similarity judgments ( Ichien et al . , 2021 ) as well as patterns of neural similarity among relations observed during analogical reasoning ( Chiang et al . , 2021 ) . At the same time , Word2vec proved very effective in providing semantic vectors for individual concepts ( nodes ) , which are also crucial for PAM’s performance . Perhaps most notably , subtle variations in patterns of node similarity predicted a previously - unexplained asymmetry in resolution of an ambiguous mapping , observed in a study by Spellman and Holyoak ( 1996 ; Simulation 3 ) . Thus semantic content—of both concepts and relations—is fundamental to human analogical mapping . Like previous models in the tradition of representation matching , PAM is able to capture the human ability to perform zero - shot learning by analogical transfer . In the spirit of other recent work in this tradition ( Doumas et al . , 2020 ; Forbus et al . , 2017 ) , the model makes progress ( though still incomplete ) toward achieving a key aim emphasized by end - to - end models : automating the generation of analog representations . PAM , coupled with Word2vec and BART , enables semi - automated generation of the inputs to the mapping module for analogies presented in verbal form , either as sets of keywords or as short texts . When the inputs are texts , the initial extraction of key concepts and their relations is aided by NLP techniques that serve as proxies ( albeit imperfect ) for human text comprehension . Given the limitations of the NLP techniques we have so far explored , this process requires some human intervention . But once the nodes and edges in semantic relation graphs have been specified , the remainder of the mapping process is fully automated . By building Probabilistic Analogical Mapping 60 a mapping model on top of learning mechanisms grounded in distributional semantics , we can draw closer to the goal of being able to automate analogical reasoning for natural - language inputs . Forms of Relational Representation The BART / PAM framework for learning relations and reasoning with them exemplifies the general view that ( at least for humans ) relational knowledge in acquired by a series of re - representations ( Penn , Holyoak , & Povinelli , 2008 ) . These successive representations of relational knowledge lie on a continuum from highly implicit to increasingly explicit ( see Doumas & Hummel , 2012 ) . Within the model presented in the present paper , four distinct representations that include relational information can be distinguished . ( 1 ) Word embeddings created by Word2vec take the form of densely distributed vectors representing the meanings of individual concepts ( words ) . Within these embeddings , some features carry relational information , but in an implicit and “entangled” manner ( Moradshahi et al . , 2021 ) . To take a hypothetical example , the embeddings for the words rich and poor may each include features associated ( in a probabilistic manner ) with such relational concepts as money , continuous quantity , and relative extremity . ( 2 ) Given word pairs that form positive and negative examples of a target relation , the learning mechanisms in BART take advantage of statistical information coded by Word2vec features ( coupled with derived features created by reordering based on the magnitudes of feature differences between the words in a pair ) to generate a weight distribution over word features , thereby predicting the posterior probability of the target relation ( e . g . , opposite ) . This weight distribution for a relation provides a new implicit representation that captures the relative importance of various word features in predicting the relation . ( 3 ) The computed posterior probability that the target relation holds is then treated as a representation of the degree to which a word pair satisfies the relation , coded as the value of a disentangled “relation feature” in a new Probabilistic Analogical Mapping 61 representational space of relations . ( 4 ) BART forms an explicit semantic - relation vector composed of values ( i . e . , posterior probabilities ) of the features corresponding to its learned relations . As a disentangled and explicit ( though distributed ) representation , this vector makes it possible to form PAM graphs in which the specific relation between two words ( edge attribute ) is distinct from the meanings of the individual keywords being related ( node attributes ) . Importantly , these successive relation representations do not replace one another , but rather support complementary cognitive abilities . Most notably , the weight distributions learned by BART accomplish the eduction of relations for any word pair , whereas the resulting semantic vectors allow analogical comparisons ( the eduction of correlates ) . Semantic relation vectors do not exhaust the forms in which relational knowledge can be represented . These vectors are distinct from verbs and other linking words that constitute multi - place predicates in natural language—a yet more explicit form of relation representation . The relation vector for a particular pair of words need not correspond to a predicate ; however , specific relation features ( individually or as a set ) may be linked to corresponding predicates ( e . g . , contrast features might be connected to the phrase “is opposite of” , and part - whole features to “is a part of” ) . At the same time , most verbs and other multi - place predicates ( e . g . , chase , kill , love , give ) probably do not directly correspond to features in a semantic relation vector . Philosophers have distinguished between relations that are internal —those that hold by nature of the terms they relate—versus external ( e . g . , Clementz , 2014 ) . Word embeddings tend to capture generic information about concepts ( Cimpian & Markman , 2008 ; Graham , Gelman , & Clarke , 2016 ) — properties that are intrinsic to the meaning of the words ( pansy is a type of flower ) or highly typical ( read is an action performed on a book ) . Given that the semantic relations learned by BART are extracted from generic feature representations of their relata ( i . e . , word embeddings ) , these Probabilistic Analogical Mapping 62 relations can be construed as internal . Semantic relation vectors thus focus on internal relations between generic word meanings , whereas predicates of a natural language can refer to all types of relations . Thus a model such as BART , which aims to learn semantic relation vectors , has a different ( though ultimately related ) goal than does a model such as DORA ( Doumas et al . , 2008 ) , which focuses on learning predicates . Coding Sentential Information in Semantic Relation Graphs PAM operates on attributed graphs consisting of nodes representing individual concepts and edges representing the educed relations between concepts ( Spearman , 1923 ) , rather than on structured propositions as assumed by previous models of analogical mapping in the tradition of representation matching . An important issue concerns whether and how semantic relation networks can capture the detailed structural information provided by sentences of natural language ( or by abstract propositions derived from sentences ) . An obvious limitation of semantic relation vectors is that all relations are binary ( connecting two words ) , whereas the predicates of natural language also include ( at least ) ternary relations ( b is between a and c ; x gave y to z ) . In our simulations of analogies expressed by text , we introduced a convention for coding subject - verb - object sentences as sets of unidirectional edges in a graph ( e . g . , “dog chases cat” becomes the trio of binary relations dog : chase , chase : cat , dog : cat ) . This convention captures at least part of the relational structure conveyed by simple sentences , enabling PAM to predict the greater difficulty of cross mappings ( see Simulation 4 based on Gentner & Toupin , 1986 ) . The basic approach of translating simple sentences into a set of unidirectional binary links could be extended to sentences that include an indirect object ( e . g . , “The boy gave a book to the girl” ) , which express ternary relations . By adopting NLP techniques that create relatively “flat” syntactic parses ( perhaps with a version of dependency grammar ; see Jurafsky & Martin , 2021 , Chapter 14 ) , the general approach Probabilistic Analogical Mapping 63 could be further extended to handle sentential complements ( a type of sentence embedding ) , such as “The woman believed that the boy loved the girl . ” Moreover , a parser could be used to augment semantic relation vectors with features indicating syntactic ( e . g . , subject versus object ) and / or thematic roles ( e . g . , agent versus patient ) . It remains an open question whether analogical mapping requires sensitivity to aspects of relations that cannot be fully captured by semantic relation networks . It has often been claimed that analogical mapping ( at least for older children and adults ) depends on representations of “higher - order” relations ( those that take propositions as arguments , typically corresponding to verbs that take sentential complements ) . Higher - order relations have been assumed to increase the “systematicity” of mappings ( Gentner , 1983 ) . However , Simulation 4 ( Gentner & Toupin , 1986 ) raises the possibility that at least some evidence for the impact of systematicity can be explained without positing access to higher - order relations at all . An alternative general explanation is that mapping benefits from greater text coherence ( Kintsch , 1988 ) , which does not necessarily depend on higher - order propositions . Within the PAM model , mapping performance will generally be facilitated by any and all textual cues that establish unambiguous semantic relations between multiple pairs of interconnected keywords . In fact , the majority of studies that have been interpreted as supporting the special importance of higher - order relations in mapping solely involve the relation cause , which has been treated as a higher - order relation between propositions describing events ( e . g . , Clement & Gentner , 1991 ; Gentner et al . , 1993 ; Forbus et al . , 2017 ) . However , linguistic evidence casts doubt on this representational assumption . Verbs that express direct causation commonly appear in single - clause sentences ( e . g . , “The boy broke the vase” ) , rather than taking sentential complements ( Kemmer & Verhagen , 1994 ; Wolff , 2003 ) . Moreover , other relations that appear syntactically equivalent to Probabilistic Analogical Mapping 64 cause ( e . g . , temporally prior to ) do not support analogical inferences in the same manner ( Lassaline , 1996 ) . Indeed , causal relations have long been viewed as having a special status in analogical reasoning—not because of their syntactic form , but because of their pragmatic relevance to goal attainment and hence analogical inference ( Winston , 1980 ; Holyoak , 1985 ) . Theories of causal reasoning have treated causal relations not as static predicates attached to higher - order propositions , but rather as active components of causal networks that generate inferences ( Pearl , 2009 ; Holyoak & Cheng , 2011 ; Waldmann & Hagmayer , 2013 ) . Analogical inferences are sensitive to such basic distinctions as that between generative and preventive causes , and predictive ( cause to effect ) versus diagnostic ( effect to cause ) inferences ( Holyoak , Lee , & Lu , 20 10 ; Lee & Holyoak , 2008 ) . Thus although causal relations indeed have special properties , their impact on analogical reasoning may have little to do with the syntactic form of causal propositions . Limitations and Future Directions Whatever role ( direct or indirect ) that propositions may play in analogical mapping , such representations are likely to be important for other aspects of analogical reasoning . In particular , PAM has yet to be extended to address the later stages , inference and schema induction . While semantic relation networks enable flexible and computationally - efficient analogical mapping , more detailed propositional representations ( or at least the syntax of natural language ) may well be required to enable construction of explanations for mappings , and to aid in the generation of structured analogical inferences . The immediate output of PAM is simply a set of mappings between individual keywords from the source and target . However , if the analogs were presented as structured text , the basic algorithm of “copy with substitution” ( CWS ; Holyoak , Novick , & Melz , 1994 ) can be used to generate analogical inferences . For example , the mapping between the The General story and the radiation problem ( Simulation 5 ) yields correspondences that include Probabilistic Analogical Mapping 65 commander  doctor and army  ray . If the source contains the sentence , “The commander divides the army” , CWS would yield the inference “The doctor divides the ray”—a valuable aid in constructing a parallel convergence solution to the radiation problem . More generally , the two types of explicit relation representations ( semantic relations and predicate - centered propositions ) may prove to be complementary . PAM can construct semantic relation networks and use them to produce a quick sketch of the mapping between two analogs , coupled with an evaluation of overall mapping quality . If the mapping appears to be promising , propositional representations can potentially be used to develop the mapping in greater detail and to generate inferences from it . A number of extensions of the PAM model appear feasible . The relation vectors provided by BART could be improved by training the model on a broader range of relations , particularly the types of thematic relations that link verbs with nouns . Mapping could in principle be based in part on embeddings of concepts derived from larger units than words , including sentences ( Devlin et al . , 2019 ) , and visula embeddings derived from images via convolutional neural networks . PAM’s procedure for iterative updating of the mapping matrix could include a slack column of allowing concepts that do not map well to go unmatched . The iterative search for an optimal mapping might allow the value of the α parameter to vary ( i . e . , seeking a trade - off between a focus on node versus edge similarity that maximizes mapping quality ) using hierarchical Bayesian modeling approach . A further extension might allow the search for an optimal mapping to include variations in the encodings of the analogs , as suggested by the Copycat model ( Hofstadter & Mitchell , 1994 ) . Such extensions are likely to lead to a greater emphasis on sequential processing , which is likely necessitated by capacity constraints on human analogical reasoning ( Halford et al . , 1998 ; Hummel & Holyoak , 1997 ; Keane & Brayshaw , 1988 ) . Probabilistic Analogical Mapping 66 Although the present paper deals only with verbal analogies , PAM can be used to perform mapping given any system for assigning vectors as attributes of nodes and edges in a graph . The model could therefore be adapted to solve mappings based on perceptual inputs such as pictures , given that relevant object features and perceptual relations have been identified . Relation vectors for meaningful pictures can potentially be formed as hybrids of features provided by perceptual processes and by semantic knowledge about concepts ( Lu , Liu , Ichien , Yuille , & Holyoak , 2019 ) . It seems possible that even formal relations , such as those used in psychological studies of the acquisition of relational schemas ( Halford , Bain , Maybery , & Andrews , 1998 ; Halford & Busby , 2007 ; Phillips , 2021 ) , as well as those that occur in mathematics , can also be represented by relation vectors with semantic content . Indeed , studies such as that by Halford et a l . ( 1998 ) have shown that learning of new formal relations can be facilitated by encouraging participants to map them onto known meaningful relations . Similarly , people’s interpretation and use of arithmetic operations appears to be guided by semantic alignment between mathematical and real - life situations . The entities in a problem situation evoke semantic relations ( e . g . , tulips and vases evoke the functionally asymmetric contain relation ) , which people align with analogous mathematical relations ( e . g . , the non - commutative division operation : tulips / vases ; Bassok & Olseth , 1995 ; Bassok , Chase , & Martin , 1998 ) . A similar form of semantic alignment guides the use of different formats for rational numbers—fractions and decimals . Adults in the United States and South Korea ( Lee , DeWolf , Bassok , & Holyoak , 2016 ) , as well as Russia ( Tyumeneva et al . , 2018 ) , selectively use fractions and decimals to model discrete ( i . e . , countable ) and continuous entities , respectively . Favored semantic alignments may reflect selective similarities between relation vectors that represent mathematical and real - world relations . Probabilistic Analogical Mapping 67 PAM may be able to contribute to efforts to automate the discovery of analogies in online databases ( e . g . , by searching an inventory of patents for inventions ) . A processing pipeline might use algorithms for natural language processing to summarize texts stored in electronic form and to extract key concepts coupled with basic syntax . The extracted information would then be processed to form knowledge graphs with rich semantics for concepts and relations , which could in turn be passed to PAM to identify potential source analogs relevant to solving a specified target problem . Our broader aim is to foster the evolving synergy between theoretical ideas drawn from AI and from cognitive science , in order both to understand human reasoning more fully and to enhance the reasoning capacities of machines .

A version of the manuscript has been posted on arXiv : https : / / arxiv . org / abs / 2103 . 16704 Footnotes 1 . The variable we refer to as “compatibility” ( of object and relational similarity ) was termed “transparency” by Gentner and Toupin ( 1986 ) . For methodological reasons , in their experiment the characters were varied in the source rather than target , which creates the same 2x2 design used in our simulation . 2 . Here we encounter an unfortunate conflict between the target / source terminology of the analogy literature and the cue / target terminology of the memory literature . In typical analog retrieval , a target analog serves as a retrieval cue , and potential source analogs are available as “targets” stored in long - term memory . We will continue to use the term “target” in the sense of a target analog . 3 . Equation 7 can potentially be refined to deal with situations in which semantic relation graphs for different analogs vary substantially in size ( cf . Marshall , 1995 ) . In addition , a Probabilistic Analogical Mapping 69 quantitative model would relativize retrieval probability to reflect competition among alternative source analogs stored in memory ( Hummel & Holyoak , 1997 ) . In the present simulations the analogs are of similar size , and we only make qualitative predictions ( aiming to predict the rank order of retrieval probabilities for different possible source analogs ) .

Simulation 1 : Model Comparisons for Triplet Analogy Experiment We compared PAM’s performance in solving the triplet analogies to that of nine control models . The models differed in ( a ) how they represented constituent pairwise relations and ( b ) the mapping algorithm used . Four alternatives for forming relation vectors linking were pairs were assessed : ( 1 ) difference vectors computed directly from Word2vec vectors for head and tail keywords ( Word2vec - diff ) ; ( 2 ) the vector of role probabilities for the head word computed by BART , without relation information ( BART - role ) ; ( 3 ) the vector of relation probabilities computed by BART , without role information ( BART - rel ) ; ( 4 ) the concatenated role and relation vectors respectively used in BART - role and BART - rel ( BART - full ) . In addition , for PAM control model ablation simulations , we tested a Nodes - only version that lacks relation representations altogether , and a BART edges - only version that includes full BART vectors ( relation plus roles ) without node vectors . In all model variants , all relations were coded as bidirectional . For PAM simulations , we used lexical similarity weight of 𝛼𝛼 = 0 . 1 and BART relation vectors with a nonlinear power transformation that emphasizes the strongest elements of the relation vector ( power of 5 , based on model comparisons reported by Ichien et al . , 2021 ) . Two algorithms were compared . One was the PAM algorithm for graph matching based on graduated assignment . The other was an exhaustive algorithm in which the concatenation of the three pairwise relations in the source triplet ( presented in a horizontal row with order fixed ; see Figure 2A in main text ) was compared to each of the 6 possible ordered concatenations of the vectors for the three pairwise relations in the target triplet ( words presented in random order in vertical column , with relations A : B , B : C and C : D ) . For each of the 6 comparisons between concatenated vectors for source and target , cosine similarity was calculated , and the target vector yielding the highest similarity with the source vector was used to define the predicted mapping of words in the target to those in the source . Probabilistic Analogical Mapping 90 For all models , overall accuracy was calculated as the proportion of the 132 distinct mapping problems of each type for which the model generated the complete correct mapping . Human accuracy for complete problems was scored in the same way . In order to make more detailed comparisons between model and human performance at the level of individual problems , we calculated the root - mean - square deviation ( RMSD ) of each model ' s responses from the corresponding human responses on each individual problem spanning both Category and Part - Object - Location triplets . For the RMSD analysis , all responses ( for models and humans ) were scored as 1 for a fully correct mapping , . 5 for a partially correct mapping , and 0 for an incorrect mapping . Results are summarized in Table S2 . The standard PAM model yielded the highest overall performance , achieving both the highest accuracy and the smallest deviation from human performance across all model variants . Notably , the Nodes - only model ( no relations ) results in a drop in overall accuracy and an increase in its deviation from human performance , compared to the standard PAM model . On the other hand , removing the effect of lexical similarity ( BART edges - only model ) does not harm performance much at all . This is not surprising , since the standard PAM model for this task uses a low weight for lexical similarity ( 𝛼𝛼 = 0 . 1 ) . This asymmetry in the impact of edges and nodes emphasizes the importance of relation information in analogical mapping , even for these simple 3 - term mapping problems . Moreover , both PAM and the Exhaustive mapping algorithm showed considerable sensitivity to the particular kind of relation representation used to construct its edges . Using Word2vec - diff relation representations with both algorithms consistently yields a stark drop in performance , compared to the various BART relation representations , demonstrating the importance of semantic relation content on analogical mapping . Probabilistic Analogical Mapping 91 Table S2 . Comparison of standard PAM ( PAM + BART - full ) and control models with human accuracy on triplet analogy problems for Simulation 1 . Root - mean - square deviation ( RMSD ) values indicate the average deviation of model responses on individual problems from human responses on corresponding problems ( lower values indicate closer approximation to human performance ) . The RMSD is calculated for all questions for both types of triplets . Boldface indicates the best model performance , which is achieved by the standard PAM model . In addition to examining overall performance on the analogy triplets , we also examined the extent that the control models could account for variability in mapping accuracy for each word position within Category and Part - Object - Location triplets . As described in the main text , the standard PAM model correctly predicts the lowest accuracy for the middle word position in Category triplets , and the lowest accuracy for the first word position in Part - Object - Location triplets . Figure S1 presents the proportion of correct mappings made by the PAM model and four variants of it ( see Table S1 ) .

The models that lack any sort of BART relations ( Nodes - only and Word2vec - diff ) are considerably less accurate than humans , and fail to capture the pattern across word position for Part - Object - Location triplets . This discrepancy highlights the importance of BART ' s disentangled relation representations for PAM ' s ability to generate human - like mapping performance . Figure S1 .

Simulation 2 : Model Comparisons for Mapping Science Analogies and Metaphors Keyword representations of 10 science analogies and 10 common metaphor problems were adopted from Turney ( 2008 ) . Each analogy involves a source domain and a structurally similar target domain between which a knowledgeable human reasoner can identify a rich set of relational correspondences . The keyword representations reduce each of these analogical domains to two sets of 5 – 9 keywords . For example , the source solar system is paired with the target atom , each represented by 7 keywords ( solar system set : solar system , sun , planet , mass , attracts , revolves , and gravity ; atom set : atom , nucleus , electron , charge , attracts , revolves , and electromagnetism ) . Near synonyms were substituted for multi - word synonyms ( e . g . , activate for turn on ) . Word2vec representations of keywords were used as the input to PAM . For PAM simulations , we used lexical similarity weight of 𝛼𝛼 = 1 and BART relation vectors with a nonlinear power transformation ( power term = 5 ) . All the model variants for PAM ( see Table S2 ) were tested . As shown in Table S3 , the best model performance was achieved by both the standard PAM model and the variant using BART role vectors only , suggesting that for this set of problems the role component of the relation representation was most important . Probabilistic Analogical Mapping 94 Table S3 . Comparison of standard PAM ( PAM + BART - full ) and control models with human accuracy on Turney dataset for Simulation 2 . Mapping accuracy is calculated by proportion of correctly identified correspondences of keywords between two analogs , and averaged across all 20 problems . Boldface indicates the best model performance , which is achieved by the standard PAM model and the variant with BART role vectors . PAM’s performance on individual problems can be improved by assuming knowledge about basic noun - verb - noun structure . For example , in the solar system / atom analogy , PAM mapped 5 word pairs correctly , mistakenly mapping solar system to electron and sun to atom . However , if unidirectional edges are added for noun - verb - noun structures ( e . g . , planet revolves sun is coded by unidirectional edges for planet : revolves , revolves : sun , and planet : sun ) , then PAM is able to match all seven keywords correctly . IV . Simulation 3 : Model Comparisons for Pragmatic Influences on Mapping PAM was applied to a set of non - isomorphic story analogies used in a study by Spellman and Holyoak ( 1996 , Experiment 2 ) . Each analog was a science - fiction - style description of multiple countries . As shown in Figure 5 in the main paper , the source analog included 9 concepts ( Afflu , Barebrute , Compak , rich , poor , strong , weak , aid - economic , aid - military ) , and the target analog included 10 concepts ( Grainwell , Hungerall , Millpower , Mightless , rich , poor , strong , weak , aid - economic , aid - military ) . The same Word2vec embedding vector for country was assigned to all the Mapping Algorithm Relation representatio Mapping accur on PAM Word2vec - diff . 77 Nodes - only . 77 BART edges - only . 67 BART - role . 85 BART - rel . 73 BART - full . 85 Probabilistic Analogical Mapping 95 imaginary countries used in both analogs ( hence node similarity could not discriminate among the possible mappings for any country ) . For PAM simulations , we used lexical similarity weight of 𝛼𝛼 = 1 and BART relation vectors with nonlinear power transformation ( power term = 5 ) for the simulation . During each simulation run , PAM sampled the value of its attention weight from a uniform distribution within the range of [ 1 , 1 . 1 ] . The model results were computed as the mean mapping probability averaged across 1000 runs . All the model variants for PAM ( see Table S2 ) were tested . Given the complexity of the experimental design , we focused model comparisons on two key qualitative aspects of the human data . First , for each model , we determined whether it predicted the qualitative shift in the mapping for the ambiguous country ( Barebrute ) depending on the pragmatic focus on military or else economic relations . Second , we determined whether each model predicted the asymmetry in this shift ( more pronounced for the military than for the economic conditions ) . Finally , we calculated the correlation between model predictions and human response proportions across the 10 conditions in the design ( see Figure 6 in main paper for human data and predictions of the standard PAM model ) . As summarized in Table S4 , the highest correlation ( . 96 ) was achieved by the standard PAM model and the two variants that included BART roles and / or relations . These three models all were able to account for the two key qualitative differences . However , good model performance also required inclusion of node vectors : performance of the variant with BART edges - only was poor . The nodes - only model and the Word2vec - diff model failed completely . The former model , lacking any relations that could be influenced by attention weights , generated identical predictions for response proportions across all experimental conditions . The latter model failed to yield any solution . Because all the imaginary countries were coded by identical node vectors ( the vector for country ) , they generated cosine distances Probabilistic Analogical Mapping 96 of 0 . In summary , BART vectors proved to be critical in accounting for the influence of pragmatic factors on human mapping . Table S4 . Comparison of PAM and control models with human performance for Simulation 3 of pragmatic impact of goals on mapping ( Spellman & Holyoak , 1992 , Experiment 2 ) , based on predicted and observed mappings for the ambiguous country ( Barebrute ) . Boldface indicates the best model performance , which is achieved by the standard PAM model and the variants based on BART roles and / or relations . V . Simulation 4 : Model Comparisons for Systematicity and Compatibility ( Relational Shift ) We simulated findings from a classic developmental study by Gentner and Toupin ( 1986 ) . Both source and target analogs involved three animal characters with manipulations of systematicity and compatibility between animals involved in source and target stories . In the simulation , we ran the model for 8 different sets of three animals in the original stories in Gentner and Toupin experiment . ( One additional set was omitted because Word2vec representations for a keyword were not available . ) These materials are included in an inventory of verbal analogy problems ( Ichien , Lu , & Holyoak , 2020 ) . The reported results are from the mappings averaged across the 8 datasets . For each set , we tested all possible assignments of potential mappings for the three animals for the medium compatibility ( 6 ) and low Mapping Algorithm Relation representations predict the qualitative shift in mapping ambiguous country ? predict asymmetry in shift ( Military vs .

The high compatibility condition allowed only one possible assignment . Model predictions for all conditions were based on the mean correct mappings for the three animals across all sets and possible assignments . Table S5 . Example model comparisons for Simulation 4 ( Gentner & Toupin , 1986 ) . Mean number of correct mappings ( max = 3 ) is reported for each condition ( older children only ) . We tested all the usual variants of the PAM model ( see Table S2 ) . All the models that include both nodes and edges ( i . e . , all models except Nodes - only and BART edges - only ) can qualitatively account for the basic relational shift ( by assuming 𝛼𝛼 = 2 for younger children and 𝛼𝛼 = 1 for older children ) . To illustrate predictions for the variables of systematicity and compatibility , Table S5 shows the predictions derived from standard PAM and two other example models using 𝛼𝛼 = 1 ( i . e . , simulating mapping accuracy for the older group ) . The nodes - only model fails to predict the effect of systematicity ( since it lacks relations ) . At the other extreme , the BART edges - only model predicts perfect accuracy for the systematic condition ( since lexical similarity has been eliminated as a factor ) . The standard PAM model , which is sensitive to both lexical and relational similarity ( i . e . , both nodes and edges ) correctly predicts the interaction between systematicity and compatibility observed in the children’s data ( see Figure 7 in main paper ) .

Simulation 5 : Model Comparisons for Solving Convergence Analogy , and Texts For Simulation 5 ( Gick & Holyoak , 1980 ) , w e tested all the usual variants of the PAM algorithm , and for each obtained the number of correct mappings for the two story analogs ( see texts and extracted keywords in Table S7 ) . Model comparisons are presented in Table S6 . Both the standard PAM model and the BART - role variant generated all 7 correct mappings , and the BART - rel variant generated 6 of 7 correct . The other variants were notably less accurate . Thus only the models that include some or all of the full BART relation vectors can solve the convergence analogy reliably . Table S6 .

Full texts of convergence analogy between The General story and the radiation problem ( Gick & Holyoak , 1980 ) . The General ( Source ) A small country fell under the iron rule of a dictator . The dictator ruled the country from a strong fortress . The fortress was situated in the middle of the country , surrounded by farms and villages . Many roads radiated outward from the fortress like spokes on a wheel . A great general arose who raised a large army at the border and vowed to capture the fortress and free the country of the dictator . The general knew that if his entire army could attack the fortress at once it could be captured . His troops were poised at the head of one of the roads leading to the fortress , ready to attack . However , a spy brought the general a disturbing report . The ruthless dictator had planted mines on each of the roads . The mines were set so that small bodies of men could pass over them safely , since the dictator needed to be able to move troops and workers to and from the fortress . However , any large force would detonate the mines . Not only would this blow up the road and render it impassable , but the dictator would then destroy many villages in retaliation . A full - scale direct attack on the fortress therefore appeared impossible . The general , however , was undaunted . He divided his army up into small groups and dispatched each group to the head of a different road . When all was ready he gave the signal , and each group charged down a different road . All of the small groups passed safely over the mines , and the army then attacked the fortress in full strength . In this way , the general was able to capture the fortress and overthrow the dictator . Radiation Problem ( Target ) Suppose you are a doctor faced with a patient who has a malignant tumor in his stomach . It is impossible to operate on the patient , but unless the tumor is destroyed , the patient will die . There is a kind of ray that can be used to destroy the tumor . If the rays reach the tumor all at once at a sufficiently high intensity , the tumor will be destroyed . Unfortunately , at this intensity , the healthy tissue that the rays pass through on the way to the tumor will also be destroyed . At lower intensities , the rays are harmless to healthy tissue , but they will not affect the tumor either . What type of procedure might be used to destroy the tumor with the rays , and at the same time avoid destroying the healthy tissue ? SI References Gentner , D . , & Toupin , C . ( 1986 ) .
