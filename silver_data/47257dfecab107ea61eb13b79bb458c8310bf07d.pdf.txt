Phosphoinositides have been implicated in nucleating coat assembly by directly binding to several endocytotic proteins including AP - 2 and AP180 . Here , we show that the stimulatory effect of ATP and GTP (cid:2) S on clathrin C coat recruitment is mediated at least in part by increased levels of PIP 2 . We also provide evidence for a role of ADP - ribosylation factor 6 ( ARF6 ) via direct stimulation of a synaptically enriched phosphatidylinositol 4 - phosphate 5 - kinase type I (cid:2) ( PIPKI (cid:2) ) , in this effect . These data suggest a model according to which activation of PIPKI (cid:2) by ARF6 - GTP facilitates clathrin - coated pit assembly at the synapse . Introduction Synaptic vesicle ( SV ) * membranes are formed and recycled by clathrin - mediated endocytosis at the presynaptic plasmalemma . This process involves the regulated and directed assembly of clathrin , AP180 , and AP - 2 adaptor complexes along with several accessory proteins at endocytotic “hot spots” surrounding the active zone ( for review see Hannah et al . , 1999 ; Brodin et al . , 2000 ; Slepnev and De Camilli , 2000 ; Takei and Haucke , 2001 ) . How precisely coat nucleation is regulated in time and space is unclear , but morphological data suggest that it is a compensatory event tightly coupled to vesicle exocytosis ( Heuser and Reese , 1973 ; Gad et al . , 1998 ) . Growing evidence implicates membrane lipids , in particular phosphoinositides , in the regulation of clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( Jost et al . , 1998 ; Cremona and De Camilli , 2001 ) . Several endocytotic proteins such as the (cid:3) and (cid:4) 2 subunits of heterotetrameric AP - 2 complexes ( Gaidarov and Keen , 1999 ; Collins et al . , 2002 ; Rohde et al . , 2002 ) , the ENTH domains of AP180 and epsin ( Ford et al . , 2001 ; Itoh et al . , 2001 ; Mao et al . , 2001 ) , and the pleckstrin homology ( PH ) domain of the large GTPase dynamin ( Barylko et al . , 1998 ) can interact directly with phosphoinositides , in particular phosphatidylinositol ( 4 , 5 ) - bisphosphate ( PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) . Phos - phatidylinositol 4 - phosphate 5 - kinase type I (cid:2) ( PIPKI (cid:2) ) and synaptojanin 1 , the major brain PI ( 4 ) phosphate 5 - kinase and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 polyphosphoinositide phosphatase , respectively , are concentrated at synapses , where they undergo activity - dependent dephosphorylation ( McPherson et al . , 1996 ; Ishihara et al . , 1998 ; Wenk et al . , 2001 ) . Moreover , elevated PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels induced by genetic inactivation of synaptojanin 1 result in the accumulation of clathrin - coated vesicles at the synapse ( Cremona et al . , 1999 ; Harris et al . , 2000 ) . These data suggest that clathrin - dependent retrieval of SV membranes may at least in part depend on phosphoinositide metabolism . Given the rapid turnover of phosphoinositides , it seems likely that PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 synthesis is under tight regulatory control ( Cremona and De Camilli , 2001 ) , thereby linking it to the exo - endocytotic cycling of SV membranes . The formation of clathrin - coated endocytotic intermediates has been reconstituted from lysed nerve terminal membranes incubated with brain cytosol and nucleotides ( Takei et al . , 1996 ) .

This effect may be contributed to some extent by an inhibition of clathrin - coated vesicle fission induced by the GTP (cid:2) S block of dynamin function ( Takei et al . , 1996 ) . However , by analogy to other vesicular transport events , one might also speculate that GTP (cid:2) S could act in part by locking a small GTPase in the GTP - bound conformation ( Springer et al . , 1999 ) . More specifically , ADP - ribosylation factor ( ARF ) family members have been implicated in clathrin - coated budding events at the Golgi complex and at the cell periphery ( Stamnes and Rothman , 1993 ; Traub et al . , 1993 ; West et al . , 1997 ) . ARF has been shown to trigger assembly of vesicle coats onto membranes by directly interacting with coat proteins ( Donaldson et al . , 1992 ; Stamnes and Roth - man , 1993 ; Traub et al . , 1993 ; Zhao et al . , 1997 ; Austin et al . , 2002 ) or by stimulating phospholipase D ( PLD ) activity ( Ktistakis et al . , 1996 ; West et al . , 1997 ; Arneson et al . , 1999 ) . Additionally , ARF family members have been found to recruit and activate PI kinases , which mediate PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 synthesis ( Godi et al . , 1999 ; Honda et al . , 1999 ) . However , so far , the physiological role of ARF proteins in the recruit - ment of clathrin / AP - 2 coats at the plasma membrane ( Rob - inson and Kreis , 1992 ; West et al . , 1997 ) and in SV recycling has remained unclear . Among the different ARF family members known to date , only ARF6 is localized to the plasma membrane , where it has been implicated in regulating actin dynamics and membrane turnover ( D’Souza - Schorey et al . , 1998 ; Randazzo et al . , 2000 ; Brown et al . , 2001 ) . ARF6 has also been demonstrated to regulate clathrin - mediated en - docytosis from the apical ( Altschuler et al . , 1999 ) and baso - lateral surface ( Palacios et al . , 2002 ) of polarized MDCK cells . Consistent with a putative role of ARF6 in SV recy - cling , mSec7 , a brefeldin A – insensitive ARF6 - specific gua - nine nucleotide exchange factor ( GEF ) has been demon - strated to function at the synapse ( Ashery et al . , 1999 ) . Here , we show that activated ARF6 facilitates clathrin / AP - 2 – coated pit nucleation from synaptic membranes via the stimulation of PIP 2 production mediated by PIPKI (cid:2) activation . Results Clathrin / AP - 2 recruitment to synaptic membranes is stimulated by ATP and GTP (cid:2) S Assembly of clathrin - and AP - 2 – coated endocytotic inter - mediates was previously reconstituted from lysed nerve ter - minal lysed synaptosomal membrane fraction ( LP2 ) mem - branes incubated with brain cytosol and nucleotides ( Takei et al . , 1996 ) . LP2 membranes mainly consist of synaptic ves - icles ( SV ) and endosomal membranes . Carbonate treatment of LP2 efficiently removed associated clathrin , AP180 , and AP - 2 ( Fig . 1 A ) , enabling us to biochemically analyze mem - brane recruitment of clathrin / AP - 2 coat proteins from added cytosol in vitro ( see also Haucke and De Camilli , 1999 ) . To study the nucleotide dependence of clathrin coat recruitment , LP2 membranes were incubated with brain cy - tosol and re - isolated by centrifugation . Membrane - associ - ated proteins were detected by immunoblotting . A pool of AP - 2 and clathrin was found associated with LP2 mem - branes when the reaction was performed in the absence of nucleotides ( Fig . 1 B ) . The concomitant presence of 2 mM ATP and 200 (cid:4) M GTP (cid:2) S greatly stimulated recruitment of both coat components onto the membrane ( Fig . 1 , A – C ) . GTP (cid:2) S alone was not sufficient to enhance AP - 2 and clath - rin binding , whereas ATP alone or ATP plus GTP resulted in a small increase of membrane - associated coat proteins . ( Fig . 1 , B and C ) . By contrast , membrane binding of the cy - tosolic chaperone Hsc70 ( analyzed as a control protein ) only required ATP , but was not affected by guanine nucleotides ( Fig . 1 B ) . The presence of ATP and GTP (cid:2) S also stimulated recruitment of the monomeric clathrin adaptor AP180 ( and PIPKI (cid:2) ; see below for details ) , whereas the association of tu - bulin or endophilin with the membrane was not affected by these nucleotides ( Fig . 1 D ) . Together , these results confirm earlier morphometric data on the nucleotide - dependent for - mation of clathrin - coated buds ( Takei et al . , 1996 ) , and sug - gest that activation of a GTPase is involved in the nucleation of clathrin / AP - 2 coats at the presynaptic plasmalemma . Because GTP (cid:2) S alone was not sufficient to stimulate coat recruitment , we hypothesized that the addition of ATP was needed to drive phosphorylation reactions . Indeed , the pres - ence of A3 , a broad spectrum kinase inhibitor , potently in - hibited ATP / GTP (cid:2) S - stimulated recruitment of AP - 2 and clathrin ( Fig . 1 E ) . Clathrin / AP - 2 recruitment to synaptic membranes is not inhibited by brefeldin A ARF family members have been shown to facilitate vesicle budding by stimulating recruitment of coat components to the membrane ( Springer et al . , 1999 ) . Therefore , we tested the effect of brefeldin A ( BFA ) on clathrin / AP - 2 recruit - ment in our assay . BFA inhibits nucleotide exchange factors acting on ARF family members except most of those spe - cific for ARF6 ( Randazzo et al . , 2000 ) . Consistent with ear - lier observations on AP - 2 association with the plasma mem - brane of intact cells ( Robinson and Kreis , 1992 ) , no effect on the ATP - and GTP (cid:2) S - dependent recruitment of AP - 2 and AP180 to LP2 membranes ( Fig . 2 ) was seen . When iso - lated Golgi membranes were used instead of synaptic mem - branes , addition of BFA completely blocked clathrin bind - ing to the Golgi complex ( unpublished data ; Robinson and Kreis , 1992 ) . In agreement with these results , it has been found that BFA does not affect SV recycling , the main traf - fic pathway mediated by clathrin / AP - 2 coats at the synapse ( Mundigl et al . , 1993 ) . Together , our data implicate a GTPase distinct from ARF1 - 5 ( Randazzo et al . , 2000 ) in the stimulation of ATP / GTP (cid:2) S - induced coat recruitment to synaptic membranes . Such a GTPase could be ARF6 , the BFA - insensitive ARF family member known to act at the cell surface . Consistent with this possibility , we observed recruitment of a substan - tial amount of ARF6 along with clathrin , AP180 , and AP - 2 to LP2 membranes on incubation with cytosol in the pres - ence of ATP and GTP (cid:2) S ( Fig . 1 A ) . ARF6 is enriched in synaptic plasma membrane subfractions A role of ARF6 in presynaptic clathrin - mediated vesicle re - cycling is plausible given the enrichment of the ARF6 - spe - on A p r il 29 , 2016 j c b . r up r e ss . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m Published July 7 , 2003 Th e J ou r n a l o f C e ll B i o l o gy ARF6 and PIPKI (cid:2) in clathrin coat recruitment | Krauss et al . 115 cific nucleotide exchange factor mSec7 in nerve terminals ( Ashery et al . , 1999 ) . pAbs that recognize ARF6 but not ARF1 ( Fig . 3 A ) detect high level expression of ARF6 in sev - eral tissues , including brain , as previously reported ( Cave - nagh et al . , 1996 ; Yang et al . , 1998 ; and unpublished data ) . The subcellular distribution of ARF6 as well as that of other well - characterized synaptic markers was analyzed in fractions of pig brain ( obtained by the procedure of Maycox et al . [ 1992 ] ) . ARF6 was found in synaptosomes ( P2 ) and within synaptosomes was primarily localized to the plasma mem - brane – containing fraction ( LP1 ; Fig . 3 B ) . The LP2 frac - tion , mostly comprising SV and endosomal membranes , was highly enriched in the SV protein synaptophysin , but con - tained only relatively low levels of ARF6 . ARF6 was also present ( but not enriched ) in highly purified clathrin - coated vesicles isolated from nerve terminals ( Fig . 3 B ) or whole brain ( not depicted ) . Consistent with these biochemical data , activated HA - tagged ARF6 ( Q67L ) accumulated at synapses in transfected cortical neurons grown in vitro , as demonstrated by its enrichment in synaptophysin - positive structures . ( Fig . 3 C ) . We conclude that ARF6 is present at synapses , where it is found predominantly in plasma mem - brane fractions from which SV recycling occurs . Effect of ARF6 mutants on clathrin / AP - 2 recruitment to synaptic membranes To investigate directly whether ARF6 can trigger AP - 2 / clathrin coat formation , we tested recombinant myristoy - lated ARF6 mutants for their ability to facilitate clathrin / AP - 2 recruitment to carbonate - washed LP2 membranes de - void of endogenous membrane - bound ARF6 ( Fig . 1 A ) . Re - actions were performed in the presence of 200 (cid:4) M GTP instead of GTP (cid:2) S to prevent generalized activation of all endogenous GTPases . Addition of 1 (cid:4) M recombinant ARF6 ( Q67L ) , an ARF6 mutant locked in the GTP - bound state due to defective GTP hydrolysis , was sufficient to pro - mote recruitment of clathrin , AP - 2 , and AP180 as efficiently as addition of GTP (cid:2) S in the absence of exogenous ARF Figure 1 .

By contrast , ARF6 ( T27N ) , a GTP - binding de - fective dominant - negative mutant , failed to increase binding of coat proteins to membranes . ARF6 ( Q67L ) - stimulated coat recruitment was dose - dependent with half - maximal stimulation seen at (cid:2) 120 nM ARF6 ( Fig . 4 B ) . High con - centrations of ARF6 ( T27N ) ( above 2 (cid:4) M ) instead inhibited the ATP / GTP (cid:2) S - induced association of clathrin and AP - 2 with the membrane in a concentration - dependent manner ( Fig . 4 C ) . Like corresponding mutants of other GTPases , ARF6 ( T27N ) may trap GEFs in a stable complex , prevent - ing activation of endogenous ARF6 . ARF6 - GTP interacts directly with PIPKI (cid:2) To obtain possible insights into the mechanism by which ARF6 - GTP stimulates clathrin / AP - 2 recruitment to synap - tic plasma membranes , we used an affinity purification ap - proach . In pull - down experiments , NH 2 - terminal GST fu - sion constructs of the constitutively active ARF6 ( Q67L ) or the GTP - binding defective mutant ARF6 ( T27N ) were ana - lyzed for their ability to retain various endocytotic proteins . Considering that ARF1 directly interacts with AP - 1 com - plexes at the trans - Golgi network and AP - 3 complexes on endosomal membranes , we initially focused on coat compo - nents as putative interactors of ARF6 . No association of ei - ther ARF6 mutant with clathrin or subunits of AP - 2 could be detected . Likewise , we did not detect any interaction of GST - ARF6 with AP180 , amphiphysin I , dynamin I , and auxilin , or the SV protein synaptotagmin I ( Fig . 5 A ) . A variety of endocytotic proteins including AP - 2 have been found to interact with the membrane via phosphoino - sitides ( Gaidarov and Keen , 1999 ; Ford et al . , 2001 ; Itoh et al . , 2001 ; Mao et al . , 2001 ; Collins et al . , 2002 ; Rohde et al . , 2002 ) . Moreover , members of the ARF family have been shown to stimulate phosphatidylinositol kinases in different systems ( Godi et al . , 1999 ; Honda et al . , 1999 ; Skippen et al . , 2002 ) . Therefore , we investigated whether ARF6 inter - acts with PIPKI (cid:2) , an isoform of PI ( 4 ) P 5 - kinase highly en - riched in brain ( Ishihara et al . , 1998 ) and concentrated in Figure 2 .

Indeed , GST - ARF6 ( Q67L ) efficiently pulled down PIPKI (cid:2) ( Fig . 5 A ) . By contrast , little interaction was seen between PIPKI (cid:2) and the inactive GDP - bound mutant GST - ARF6 ( T27N ) . Similar results were seen if N - myristoylated hexahistidine - tagged ARF6 mutants were used instead ( unpublished data ) . The interaction between ARF6 and PIPKI (cid:2) appeared to be direct because GST - ARF6 bound to radiolabeled PIPKI (cid:2) synthesized by coupled transcription / translation in vitro ( unpublished data ) . To determine the isoform speci - ficity for different ARF family members , hexahistidine - tagged myristoylated ARF6 ( Q67L ) or ARF1 ( Q71L ) were compared for their ability to bind to PIPKI (cid:2) or the trans - Golgi clathrin adaptor AP - 1 , a protein complex known to bind to both ARF1 and ARF6 ( Austin et al . , 2002 ) . Al - though both ARF1 ( Q71L ) and ARF6 ( Q67L ) displayed similar affinities for AP - 1 , as detected by Western blotting of the affinity - purified material for the AP - 1 subunit (cid:2) adaptin , only ARF6 was able to effectively pull - down PIPKI (cid:2) ( Fig . 5 B ) .

Together , these re - sults show that ARF6 specifically binds to PIPKI (cid:2) in vitro in a GTP - dependent manner , but not to clathrin / AP - 2 coat components . To finally determine whether ARF6 associated with PIPKI (cid:2) during clathrin / AP - 2 recruitment to synaptic mem - branes , we performed chemical cross - linking experiments . To this aim , LP2 membranes were first incubated with cyto - sol , ATP , ARF6 ( T27N ) - His 6 or ARF6 ( Q67L ) - His 6 , and GDP or GTP , respectively . 3 , 3 (cid:5) - Dithio - bis ( propionic acid N - hydroxysuccinimide ester ) ( DTSP ) , a cleavable amine - reactive cross - linking reagent was added , samples were solu - bilized under denaturing conditions , and ARF6 - His 6 was re - covered by Ni - NTA affinity chromatography . ARF6 ( Q67L ) but not its inactive GDP - bound counterpart ( T27N ) be - came efficiently cross - linked to PIPKI (cid:2) ( Fig . 5 C ) . No inter - action was seen with clathrin , AP180 , or any of the individ - ual subunits of the AP - 2 adaptor complex . Our combined data suggest that ARF6 - GTP directly interacts with PIPKI (cid:2) on synaptic membranes . ARF6 - GTP and PIPKI (cid:2) colocalize in transfected cells The biochemical interaction of ARF6 with PIPKI (cid:2) was supported by morphological studies of cotransfected cells . Consistent with previous data ( Brown et al . , 2001 ) , ARF6 ( Q67L ) - EGFP expressed in Cos7 cells was found in peripheral plasma membrane invaginations , vacuolar structures and membrane ruffles . In these structures , it colocalized with cotransfected PIPKI (cid:2) - p90 ( Fig . 6 A ) . By contrast , little if any colocalization was seen between PIPKI (cid:2) and the inactive GDP mutant of ARF6 ( Fig . 6 B ) . As expected , PIPKI (cid:2) - containing structures were highly enriched in PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , as visualized by coexpression of PH PLC (cid:8) - EGFP , a specific interactor for this phosphoinosi - tide ( Fig . 6 C ) . ARF6 directly activates PIPKI (cid:2) on liposomes Given the interaction of ARF6 - GTP with PIPKI (cid:2) , we asked whether ARF6 might regulate phosphatidylinositol 4 - phos - phate 5 - kinase activity in bovine brain cytosol .

Under these conditions ( i . e . , addition of neomycin ) , no formation of phosphatidic acid from 3 H - labeled phosphatidylcholine was detectable ( unpublished data ) . To analyze whether ARF6 directly activates PIPKI (cid:2) , we monitored the activity of recombinant PIPKI (cid:2) - p90 in an in vitro assay using liposomes made of total brain lipids as a substrate . Liposomes were incubated with recombinant PIPKI (cid:2) and myristoylated ARF6 , or mutants thereof , in the presence of 200 (cid:4) M GTP and (cid:2) [ 32 P ] ATP . Lipid products were analyzed as described above . Myristoylated ARF6 ( Q67L ) induced a strong increase in kinase activity compared with the basal activity seen in the absence of ARF ( Fig . 7 B ) . A similar ( albeit weaker ) effect was produced by wild - type ARF6 . By contrast , the GTP - binding defective mutant ARF6 ( T27N ) failed to enhance kinase activity ( Fig . 7 B ) . The stimulatory effect of ARF6 on PIP 2 generation from total brain lipids was smaller than that observed with liposomes containing high concentrations of PI ( 4 ) P ( com - pare Fig . 7 A with Fig . 7 B ) , presumably due to incomplete substrate saturation of the enzyme . These data suggest that ARF6 - GTP stimulates PIPKI (cid:2) activity under conditions mimicking physiological substrate levels . Although addition of activated ARF6 increased formation of PIP 2 from total brain lipids , no effect on PIP generation was detectable ( Fig . 7 C ) . Moreover , immunodepletion of PIPKI (cid:2) from cytosol almost completely abolished PIP 2 for - mation ( see also Wenk et al . , 2001 ) , and this defect could not be restored by addition of exogenous ARF6 - GTP or mutants thereof ( Fig . 7 C ) . This indicates that ARF6 - medi - ated stimulation of PIP 2 synthesis is indeed primarily due to activation of PIPKI (cid:2) . In summary , these results demonstrate a direct interaction between activated ARF6 and PIPKI (cid:2) in brain cytosol that results in a strong stimulation of PI ( 4 ) P 5 kinase activity and PIP 2 formation . Figure 7 . ARF6 directly stimulates the activity of endogenous or recombinant PIPKI (cid:2) . ( A ) Liposomes containing phosphatidylinositol 4 - phosphate ( 6 % , wt / wt ) as a substrate were incubated for 10 min at 37 (cid:9) C with brain cytosol and recombinant myristoylated ARF6 mutants ( 200 nM ) as indicated in the presence of neomycin , GTP , and (cid:2) [ 32 P ] ATP . Lipids were extracted and separated by HPTLC . Data represent mean values ( (cid:6) SD ) from four independent experiments . Values were normalized to the amount of PIP 2 generated in the absence of ARF6 proteins ( fold stimulation ) .

Reactions were started by addition of (cid:2) [ 32 P ] ATP , and after a 7 - min incubation ( 37 (cid:9) C ) , lipid products were extracted , separated by TLC as described previously ( Wenk et al . , 2001 ) , analyzed by autoradiography ( see bottom for a typical experiment ) and quantified ( Phosphor - Imager ) . The top shows the quantification of three independent experiments ( mean (cid:6) SD ) ; the data presented are normalized to the activity of PIPKI (cid:2) in the absence of exogenously added ARF6 proteins ( fold stimulation ) .

We stimu - lated coat recruitment to LP2 membranes with (cid:2) [ 32 P ] ATP and GTP in the absence or presence of the different ARF6 mutants . As shown in Fig . 7 D , 1 (cid:4) M recombinant ARF6 ( Q67L ) stimulated PIP 2 synthesis up to 2 . 5 - fold compared with the amount of PIP 2 formed in the presence of cytosol alone . In contrast , ARF6 ( T27N ) failed to affect PIP 2 levels in LP2 membranes . Addition of wild - type ARF6 - GTP resulted in an intermediate stimulation of PIP 2 formation ( Fig . 7 D ) . Collectively , our data suggest that ARF6 - GTP stimulates PIP 2 synthesis at the synapse by ac - tivating PIPK I (cid:2) . Masking or degradation of PIP 2 interferes with clathrin / AP - 2 – coated pit assembly and receptor - mediated endocytosis Finally , if the ARF6 - mediated stimulation of PIPKI (cid:2) played a major role in mediating the effect of ATP / GTP (cid:2) S on clath - rin / AP - 2 recruitment , one would expect that masking PIP 2 with a PIP 2 - binding module or degradation of PIP 2 by an inositol phosphatase would inhibit such recruitment to synap - tic membranes or in living cells . We performed recruitment Figure 8 . Effects of PIP 2 masking or degradation on clathrin / AP - 2 – coated pit assembly . ( A ) Recombinant human PH PLC (cid:8) 1 inhibits ATP / GTP (cid:2) S - induced membrane recruitment of clathrin / AP - 2 coat components .

Addition of recombinant PH PLC (cid:8) 1 to synaptic mem - branes inhibited the ATP / GTP (cid:2) S - induced binding of clath - rin and AP - 2 in a concentration - dependent manner , whereas addition of GST had no effect ( Fig . 8 A ) . Likewise , overex - pression of the prenylated HA - tagged inositol 5 - phosphatase domain of synaptojanin 1 ( HA - IPP1 - CAAX ) , a PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - degrading enzyme , in Cos7 cells resulted in the mislocaliza - tion of AP - 2 to patch - like structures ( Fig . 8 B ) . Similar ( albeit less dramatic ) effects were seen on peripheral clathrin - positive puncta . By contrast , a pool of clathrin remained associated with the trans - Golgi network in transfected cells ( Fig . 8 C ) . Consistent with its effects on clathrin / AP - 2 – coated pit for - mation and with previous observations ( Malecz et al . , 2000 ) , cells expressing HA - IPP1 - CAAX displayed a strongly reduced ability to internalize Texas red epidermal growth factor ( EGF ; Fig . 9 A ) or Alexa ® 488 - transferrin ( Fig . 9 B ) . Similar ( albeit slightly less pronounced ) effects on transferrin uptake were seen on overexpression of EGFP - tagged PH PLC (cid:8) ( unpublished data ) . Discussion In the present work , we have investigated mechanisms in - volved in the nucleotide - dependent regulation of clathrin - coated pit nucleation at the synapse . Our results implicate ARF6 in this process and demonstrate two effects of the GTP - bound form of this small GTPase ; stimulation of the re - cruitment of clathrin / AP - 2 to presynaptic membranes and binding plus activation of PIPKI (cid:2) . They also suggest that the two effects are related and that PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 production by PIPKI (cid:2) stimulation represents the major mechanism through which ARF6 enhances clathrin / AP - 2 recruitment . The action of GTP - ARF6 on clathrin / AP - 2 recruitment mimics the ef - fect of GTP (cid:2) s , and its effects are antagonized by experimental manipulations that prevent either ARF activation ( i . e . , domi - nant - negative ARF6 ) or PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 production and availability ( i . e . , kinase inhibition , PIPKI (cid:2) depletion , and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 hy - drolysis by synaptojanin’s inositol 5 (cid:5) - phosphatase domain ) . These results strongly indicate that enhanced clathrin coat re - cruitment mediated by a stimulation of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 synthesis plays a major role in the GTP (cid:2) S - stimulated nucleation of morphologically detectable clathrin - coated pits on synaptic membranes ( Takei et al . , 1996 ) , although a block or delay in fission may also contribute to this ultrastructural change . The strong stimulatory effect of ARF6 on PIPKI (cid:2) extends to this brain - enriched enzyme a property previously demon - strated for predominantly nonneuronal isoforms of PIPK ( Honda et al . , 1999 ; Skippen et al . , 2002 ) . It was also shown that PLD stimulation by ARF family proteins , including ARF6 , may play a role in enhanced PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 production by generating phosphatidic acid , a reported activator of PI ( 4 ) P 5 - kinases ( Brown et al . , 1993 ; West et al . , 1997 ; Arneson et al . , 1999 ) . This effect may synergize with the direct effect of ARF6 on PIPKI (cid:2) in the generation of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 at the syn - apse . Although ARF6 appears to have a broad distribution in the nervous system , the weak immunocytochemical signal produced by available antibodies to endogenous ARF6 in Figure 9 . PIP 2 degradation inhibits receptor - mediated internalization of EGF and transferrin . Overexpression of membrane - targeted HA - tagged inositol phosphatase domain of synaptojanin 1 ( HA - IPP1 - CAAX ) inhibits the internalization of epidermal growth factor ( A ; EGF ) or transferrin ( B ; Tf ) . Cos7 cells expressing HA - IPP1 - CAAX were allowed to internalize Texas red – labeled epidermal growth factor ( A ) or Alexa ® 488 - transferrin ( B ) for 10 min at 37 (cid:9) C . Cells were fixed and analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy .

However , transfected activated ARF6 ( Q67L ) appears to be concentrated at synapses , and an ARF6 - specific GEF , mSec7 , regulates SV traffic ( Ashery et al . , 1999 ) . Furthermore , PIPKI (cid:2) is highly expressed in brain ( Ishihara et al . , 1998 ) and con - centrated at synapses ( Wenk et al . , 2001 ) . Thus , our find - ings , obtained primarily using cell - free systems , are likely to reflect a physiological process occurring in vivo . The precise interplay between mSec7 and other brain ARF6 - specific GEFs , and their role in the activation of ARF6 at the presynaptic plasma membrane remains to be in - vestigated . It seems possible that ARF6 may synergize with the synaptically enriched focal adhesion protein talin in acti - vating PIPKI (cid:2) at the synapse ( Di Paolo et al . , 2002 ; Ling et al . , 2002 ) . The finding that enhanced PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 production may play a critical role in the recruitment of endocytotic clathrin coats is supported by a large body of data besides those presented here . Biochemical and structural studies have demonstrated an interaction of the clathrin adaptor AP - 2 , AP180 , and dynamin with PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( Barylko et al . , 1998 ; Gaidarov and Keen , 1999 ; Ford et al . , 2001 ; Mao et al . , 2001 ; Rohde et al . , 2002 ) . Genetic disruption of the polyphosphoinositide phosphatase synaptojanin ( Cremona et al . , 1999 ; Harris et al . , 2000 ) and other manipulations that disrupt its function and therefore lead to an accumula - tion of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in neurons , enhance the presence of clath - rin coats on synaptic membranes both in vivo ( Cremona et al . , 1999 ; Gad et al . , 2000 ) and in cell - free systems ( Cre - mona et al . , 1999 ; Wenk et al . , 2001 ; Kim et al . , 2002 ) . Our data are also consistent with ( and further support ) recent re - ports suggesting that ARF6 ( Altschuler et al . , 1999 ; Palacios et al . , 2002 ) and PIPK ( Barbieri et al . , 2001 ) regulate clath - rin - mediated endocytosis from the plasma membrane . As cell fractionation data indicate , neither ARF6 nor PIPKI (cid:2) are enriched in crude SV ( Wenk et al . , 2001 , and this paper ) . Instead , ARF6 is localized in plasma membrane frac - tions ( Cavenagh et al . , 1996 ; Yang et al . , 1998 ) , consistent with a role in priming the membrane for coating . PIPKI (cid:2) is found primarily in the cytosol ( Wenk et al . , 2001 ) , but as shown by EM ( Wenk et al . , 2001 ) and biochemically ( this paper ) , is recruited by GTP (cid:2) S , and therefore most likely by ARF6 - GTP , to the membranes at which clathrin - coated pits nucleate . A GTP (cid:2) S - stimulated recruitment of clathrin / AP - 2 coats to endosomes was demonstrated by Robinson and co - workers in nonneuronal cells ( West et al . , 1997 ) . This “mis - localization” of endocytotic clathrin coats was shown to be dependent on enhanced PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 production on endo - somes , and has been attributed to PLD activation by an ARF GTPase . Excess PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 on endosomes can also be gener - ated by overexpression of an active form of ARF6 ( Brown et al . , 2001 ) . As shown by Honda et al . ( 1999 ) and by our present results , a major mechanism through which active ARF6 may stimulate PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 production is via the recruit - ment and activation of a PI ( 4 ) P 5 - kinase activity . We specu - late that in neuronal cells , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is segregated at the plasma membrane by the coordinate action of PI ( 4 ) P 5 - kinases , which are primarily localized at the cell surface , and of the phosphoinositide phosphatase synaptojanin , which cleaves PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 on endocytotic membranes ( Kim et al . , 2002 ; Stefan et al . , 2002 ) . Excess active ARF6—either because of GTP (cid:2) S addition or because of mutation that inactivates its GTPase activity—may alter this balance and lead to an ab - normal accumulation of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 on endosomes . It seems particularly interesting that PIPKI (cid:2) is stimulated by ARF6 , a protein previously implicated in regulating actin dynamics and membrane turnover ( D’Souza - Schorey et al . , 1998 ; Randazzo et al . , 2000 ; Schafer et al . , 2000 ) . Invagina - tions of the plasma membrane that resemble those found at synapses after prolonged stimulation ( Heuser and Reese , 1973 ; Takei et al . , 1996 ; Gad et al . , 2000 ) have been de - tected in nonneuronal cells on expression of constitutively active ARF6 ( D’Souza - Schorey et al . , 1998 ) or of an ARF6 - specific exchange factor ( Franco et al . , 1999 ) . ARF6 may re - cruit and activate PIPKI (cid:2) at the synapse , thus increasing the local PIP 2 concentration . This , in turn , would facilitate the formation of endocytotic structures like clathrin - coated pits and deeper membrane invaginations from which clathrin - coated vesicle budding can also occur . A number of observa - tions suggest that clathrin - mediated endocytosis is highly in - terconnected to dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton ( Lamaze et al . , 1997 ) . Accordingly , many accessory proteins of the clathrin pathway directly couple endocytotic coat formation to actin rearrangements ( Qualmann et al . , 2000 ; Schafer et al . , 2000 ; Hussain et al . , 2001 ; Lee and De Camilli , 2002 ; Orth et al . , 2002 ) . Endocytotic “hot spots” at synapses coin - cide with actin - rich zones ( Kelly , 1999 ; Gad et al . , 2000 ) , and the accumulation of clathrin - coated vesicles induced in nerve terminals by the disruption of synaptojanin function correlates with the presence of a meshwork of actin around these vesicles ( Cremona et al . , 1999 ; Gad et al . , 2000 ; Kim et al . , 2002 ; Shupliakov et al . , 2002 ) . ARF6 may regulate ac - tin dynamics through multiple cooperative mechanisms . Via the increase in PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 production mediated by stimula - tion of PLD ( Brown et al . , 1993 ) and PIPKs ( Honda et al . , 1999 ; this paper ) , it enhances the recruitment and activation of actin regulatory proteins including N - WASP and small GTPases of the Rho family ( Takenawa and Itoh , 2001 ) . It can also directly regulate Rac via its binding to arfaptin 2 / Por1 ( Shin and Exton , 2001 ) . Possibly through its effects on Rac and actin , ARF6 can stimulate formation of macro - pinosomes ( Brown et al . , 2001 ) . Thus , ARF6 appears to have a major regulatory role in en - docytosis because it can control both clathrin - dependent and - independent endocytotic pathways . It will be critical to further elucidate the localization and regulation of ARF6 - GEFs and the effect of synaptic activity on such regulation .

Finally , the pellet was resuspended in sample buffer and proteins recruited to LP2 membranes were analyzed by quantitative Western blots using 125 I - protein A for detection and phosphoimage analysis ( Image Reader 3000 ; Fuji ) . Pull - down experiments For GST pull - downs , 0 . 5 mg / ml GST or GST - ARF6 bound to resin was sup - plemented with 1 mM GDP ( GST - ARF6 ( T27N ) ) or 1 mM GTP ( GST - ARF6 ( Q67L ) ) and incubated with 3 mg / ml mg rat brain extract ( in 20 mM Hepes / KOH , pH 7 . 4 , 320 mM sucrose , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 1 % Triton X - 100 , 1 mM PMSF , 1 (cid:4) g / ml leupeptin , 1 (cid:4) g / ml aprotinin and 100 (cid:4) g / ml Pefabloc ® ) for 4 h at 4 (cid:9) C .

Phosphoinositide kinase assays For phosphoinositide kinase assays , liposomes ( Fig . 7 , A – C ) or LP2 mem - branes ( Fig . 7 D ) were used . Large unilamellar liposomes were prepared from cholesterol / phosphatidylcholine / phosphatidylinositol 4 - phosphate ( 20 : 74 : 6 , wt / wt / wt ; Fig . 7 A ) or total brain lipids ( Fig . 7 , B and C ) . 1 . 2 mg / ml brain cytosol was pre - incubated for 2 min at 37 (cid:9) C with 200 (cid:4) M GTP , 100 (cid:4) M neomycin , 2 mM ATP , and (cid:2) [ 32 P ] ATP ( 0 . 2 (cid:4) Ci / sample ) in cyto - solic buffer ( 25 mM Hepes / KOH , pH 7 . 2 , 25 mM KCl , 2 . 5 mM magnesium acetate , and 150 mM potassium glutamate ) . 1 (cid:4) M recombinant myristoy - lated ARF6 protein was included where indicated . Phosphorylation reac - tions ( 15 min at 37 (cid:9) C in a total volume of 500 (cid:4) l ) were started by adding liposomes .

For some experiments , liposomes were substituted with LP2 membranes ( 480 (cid:4) g protein , 385 (cid:4) g total phospholipids ) as substrate . The activity of recombinant PIPKI (cid:2) - p90 or brain PIPKI (cid:2) was determined in the presence or absence of ARF6 proteins essentially as previously de - scribed using total brain lipids as a substrate ( Wenk et al . , 2001 ) .
