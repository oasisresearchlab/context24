This study aimed to identify differences in COVID‑19 related post‑traumatic stress symptoms ( PTSS ) among people living and not living with HIV ; to assess whether PTSS were associated with COVID‑19 pandemic‑related anger , loneliness , social isolation , and social support ; and to determine the association between PTSS and use of COVID‑19 prevention strategies . Methods : The data of the 3761 respondents for this analysis was extracted from a cross‑sectional online survey that collected information about mental health and wellness from a convenience sample of adults , 18 years and above , in Nigeria from July to December 2020 . Information was collected on the study’s dependent variable ( PTSS ) , inde‑ pendent variables ( self‑reported COVID‑19 , HIV status , use of COVID‑19 prevention strategies , perception of social isolation , access to emotional support , feelings of anger and loneliness ) , and potential confounder ( age , sex at birth , employment status ) . A binary logistic regression model tested the associations between independent and dependent variables . Results : Nearly half ( 47 . 5 % ) of the respondents had PTSS . People who had symptoms but were not tested ( AOR = 2 . 20 ) , felt socially isolated ( AOR = 1 . 16 ) , angry ( AOR = 2 . 64 ) , or lonely ( AOR = 2 . 19 ) had significantly greater odds of reporting PTSS ( p < 0 . 001 ) . People living with HIV ( AOR = 0 . 39 ) , those who wore masks ( AOR = 0 . 62 ) and those who had emotional support ( AOR = 0 . 63 ) , had lower odds of reporting PTSS ( p < . 05 ) . © The Author ( s ) 2022 , corrected publication 2022 .

BMC Psychiatry ( 2022 ) 22 : 48 Background Post - traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) is a psychiatric disorder that may occur in people who have experi - enced or witnessed a psychologically traumatic event such as unexpected death , immediate threat to life , seri - ous accidents and disasters , physical injury to another person , or who have been threatened by a serious event such as serious physical injury or sexual violence [ 1 ] . Reactions to these traumatic events include avoid - ance of reminders of the trauma , problems concentrat - ing , concern for safety , intrusive thoughts , irritability , nightmares , and self - blame [ 2 , 3 ] . PTSD develops when these reactions persist for a month or more and cause substantial distress and disruption to one’s life [ 3 ] . The COVID - 19 pandemic is a cause of psychologi - cal trauma as people are exposed to unexpected deaths or threats of death [ 4 ] . Healthcare workers who have had to manage COVID patients may be witnessing increased illnesses and deaths [ 5 , 6 ] . Patients admitted to the hospital with COVID - 19 experience social isola - tion , physical discomfort , and fear for survival [ 7 ] . In addition , families and friends of patients with COVID - 19 have concerns about infection , isolation , and death of loved ones [ 3 ] . These experiences increase the risk for developing PTSD especially when the individual lacks immediate social support and feels socially iso - lated ( like when in quarantine or isolation ) [ 8 , 9 ] , or may face stigma because of COVID - 19 status [ 10 , 11 ] . One of the strongest predictors of PTSD after expo - sure to a trauma is previous exposure to trauma . Spe - cifically , people living with HIV ( PLHIV ) may have previous trauma due to their medical health status and have higher risks for PTSD compared to those not liv - ing with HIV [ 12 ] . For many , the diagnosis of HIV is itself a traumatic event [ 13 ] . Also , many PLHIV live in environments characterized by poverty , violence , and lack of social support [ 14 – 16 ] which are factors asso - ciated with higher risk for PTSD [ 17 ] . For instance , women living with HIV have a higher rate of sexual assault than women in the general population [ 12 ] . PTSD may also result from the social stigma associated with being HIV positive [ 18 ] , deteriorating quality of life [ 19 ] , and is the most common mental health chal - lenge faced by PLHIV across the world [ 20 ] . A large population of PLHIV in Nigeria experience PTSD due to intense HIV - related stigmatizing events or situations . The rate of HIV - stigma related PTSD in Nigeria is 27 . 4 % [ 21 ] . The risk of experiencing HIV - stigma related PTSD is increased by a history of trau - matic events and poor access to social support [ 21 ] and self - stigma [ 22 ] . HIV - related stigma and social isola - tion is a major barrier to serostatus disclosure with huge implications for access to treatment for PLHIV in Nigeria . On the other hand , access to social support improves health and wellbeing [ 23 ] . Access to social support was reported to produce better outcomes for PLHIV in Nigeria than self - efficacy building therapy [ 24 ] . For many , social support is received mainly from individuals who aid them at home , including the fam - ily , friends , and peers living with HIV who provide emotional , spiritual , and physical care [ 24 ] . Access to these social support mechanisms by PLHIV may have been reduced during the COVID - 19 lockdown as the national directives for the COVID - 19 control included restricted movements , banned travels from countries with ongoing high transmission , locked bor - ders and requiring citizens to compulsory use of face masks , banned social gathering and encouraging regu - lar handwashing [ 25 ] . PLHIV who become infected with COVID - 19 may also face new stigma and be at increased risk for PTSD . Among individuals with PTSD , the amygdala processes peritraumatic hyperarousal to produce hyperarousal symptoms such as anger and recklessness [ 26 ] . PTSD also has a bidirectional relationship with emotional and social loneliness [ 27 ] . The association between PTSD and loneliness may reflect an overlap because people who experience both have a persistent sense of threat and hypervigilance for threats [ 28 , 29 ] , the shared experience of trauma exposure [ 30 ] , avoidance symptoms [ 31 ] , and negative evaluation of the world [ 32 ] . Social support is protective against the development of PTSD [ 33 ] while social isolation influences the predisposition of people to and onset of PTSD [ 34 ] . This study examines the relationships between PTSD symptoms , henceforth referred to as PTSS , and pan - demic - related emotional and behavioural outcomes . The first aim of this study was to identify differences in Conclusion : The present study identified some multifaceted relationships between post‑traumatic stress , HIV status , facemask use , anger , loneliness , social isolation , and access to emotional support during this protracted COVID‑19 pandemic . These findings have implications for the future health of those affected , particularly for individuals living in Nigeria . Public health education should be incorporated in programs targeting prevention and prompt diagnosis and treatment for post‑traumatic stress disorder at the community level . Keywords : HIV , PTSD , Nigeria , COVID‑19 , SARS‑COV‑2 , Mental health disorder Page 3 of 10 Folayan et al . BMC Psychiatry ( 2022 ) 22 : 48 reported PTSS between PLHIV and people not living with HIV . The second aim was to assess the association between PTSS and anger , loneliness , social isolation , and social support . The third aim was to determine the association between PTSS and risk for non - compliance with COVID - 19 prevention strategies as a manifesta - tion of recklessness symptoms . We hypothesize that more PLHIV compared to people not living with HIV will have PTSS during the COVID - 19 pandemic ; PTSS will be positively associated with anger , loneliness , social isolation , and poor access to social support during the COVID - 19 pandemic ; and PTSS will be positively asso - ciated with low use of COVID - 19 prevention strategies . The study was conducted among adults in Nigeria . Stud - ies on PTSD in Nigeria have been limited to prevalence in different populations [ 35 , 36 ] . Yet for a country with a high risk for traumatic incidences [ 37 , 38 ] now coupled with the COVID - 19 pandemic , it is important to under - stand how COVID - 19 related factors are associated with PTSS as this may help in the design and implementation of PTSD management . Methods We analysed data from a multi - country , cross - sectional survey about the impact of the COVID - 19 pandemic on the mental health and wellness of adults . This current analysis focused on data collected from adults 18 years and above , living in Nigeria in the period from July to December 2020 . The study participants were recruited through respondent - driven sampling . Initial partici - pants were asked to share the survey link with their con - tacts to facilitate recruitment ( snowball sampling ) . The survey link was also posted on social media platforms ( Facebook , Twitter , and Instagram , WhatsApp ) . Ethi - cal approval of the current study was obtained from the Human Research Ethics Committee at the Institute of Public Health of the Obafemi Awolowo University Ile - Ife , Nigeria ( HREC No : IPHOAU / 12 / 1557 ) . Prior pub - lications have more details on the study methodology [ 39 – 41 ] . Study instruments The questionnaire was preceded by a brief introduction explaining the purpose of the study , and assuring partici - pants of their voluntary participation , and the confiden - tiality of their data . The questionnaire took an average of 11 min to complete and was administered in English . Each participant could only complete a single question - naire through IP address restrictions though they could edit their answers freely until they chose to submit . Dependent variable Post‑traumatic stress symptoms The PTSD checklist for civilians was used to measure the level of post - traumatic stress symptoms ( PTSS ) that respondents had . The checklist is a 17 - item self - report questionnaire that measured PTSS [ 42 ] . It prompted respondents to measure the level of stress that they have pertaining to a problem or complaint in response to a stressful life experience ( in this case the COVID - 19 pan - demic ) over the past month . A 5 - point scale was used for respondents to rate their responses ( 1 - not at all to 5 - extremely ) . The possible scores ranged from 17 to 85 . The cut - off of 28 was used to categorize “no PTSS” ( 17 - 27 ) vs . “PTSS present” ( 28 - 85 ) [ 43 ] . Studies have demonstrated good test - retest reliability , internal consistency , and dis - criminant validities of the PTSD checklist for civilians [ 44 ] . In a study comparing its construct validity to that of the Civilian Mississippi Scale , the PTSD checklist for civilians showed greater construct validity [ 45 ] . Excel - lent internal consistency has been demonstrated in other studies [ 42 , 46 ] and the Cronbach alpha score for the cur - rent sample of respondents from Nigeria was 0 . 949 . Independent variables COVID‑19 status Respondents were asked if they had tested positive for COVID - 19 , had COVID - 19 symptoms but did not test , had a close friend who tested positive for COVID - 19 and / or knew someone who died from COVID - 19 . The response was either a ‘yes’ or a ‘no’ . HIV status A question was also asked about HIV status . Respond - ents were required to identify if their HIV status was positive , negative , unknown or if they were unwilling to declare . The respondents who identified as HIV positive were described as “living with HIV” , while the respond - ents who identified as HIV negative , unknown or unwill - ing to declare were described as “not living with HIV” . Use of COVID‑19 prevention strategies The questionnaire assessed adoption of COVID - 19 prevention strategies ( wearing of face masks , frequent washing or sanitizing hands , physical distancing ) and workplace modification ( working remotely ) . Respond - ents were asked which of the listed behaviours they adopted during the pandemic . Respondents could select more than one item to indicate that they adopted multi - ple behaviours during the pandemic . The questions were included as a component of the Pandemic Stress Index [ 47 ] . Page 4 of 10 Folayan et al . BMC Psychiatry ( 2022 ) 22 : 48 Social isolation Respondents were asked about their feeling of social iso - lation on a scale of 1 - not at all - to 10 - extremely . The question was adopted from Nguyen et al . [ 48 ] . Emotional support The Pandemic Stress Index is a 3 - item measure . One of the measures assessed was emotional support from friends and family . A check on this item indicated access to support [ 47 ] . Anger and loneliness Respondents indicated the feelings they were experienc - ing during COVID - 19 on an emotions checklist . Two of the eight emotions were anger and loneliness . The ques - tions were part of the Pandemic Stress Index adminis - tered to study participants that assessed the psychosocial impact of COVID - 19 [ 47 ] . Confounders Sociodemographic profile The section on sociodemographic profile collected data on age , sex at birth ( male , female , intersex , decline to answer ) , highest level of education attained ( none , pri - mary , secondary , college / university ) , and employment status ( unemployed , employed , student , retired ) . Statistical analysis Raw data were downloaded as SPSS ® file Version 23 . 0 ( IBM Corp . Armonk , NY , USA ) . We identified and removed survey responses completed below 7 min – the lower limit of the time range to answer the questionnaire during the pilot phase conducted with 40 participants not included in the final study data ( n = 77 ) . The pilot was part of the construct validation process conducted for the study questionnaire , which verified that the con - tent validity index was 0 . 82 . Those with incomplete data to responses on the PTSD checklist were also excluded from the study ( n = 678 ) [ 49 , 50 ] . Descriptive analysis of all study variables was con - ducted . T - test and chi square test were used to assess the relationship between the dependent variable , inde - pendent variables , and confounders . A binary logistic regression model was constructed to identify explanatory factors associated with PTSS after adjusting for potential confounders . Adjusted odds ratios ( AOR ) and 95 % confi - dence intervals ( CIs ) were calculated . The Omnibus test of model coefficients was used to determine the signifi - cant difference between the Log - ( − 2LLs ) of the baseline model and the new model inclusive of the explanatory variable . Statistical significance was set at 5 % . Results Table 1 shows that there were 3761 study participants with a mean ( standard deviation ) age of 38 . 3 ( 11 . 5 ) years . Of the 3761 study participants , 1787 ( 47 . 5 % ) had PTSS based on the cut - off score . Most respondents were female ( 52 . 7 % ) , had tertiary education ( 81 . 0 % ) , and were employed ( 71 . 2 % ) . Only 2 . 5 % tested positive for COVID - 19 , 10 . 6 % had COVID - 19 symptoms but did not get tested , 16 . 9 % had a close friend who tested posi - tive , and 31 . 7 % knew someone who died of COVID - 19 . Also , 796 ( 21 . 2 % ) respondents were PLHIV , 3165 ( 84 . 2 % ) wore face masks , 3106 ( 82 . 6 % ) frequently washed or sani - tized their hands , 2885 ( 76 . 7 % ) kept physical distance , and 1246 ( 33 . 1 % ) worked remotely . In addition , 289 ( 7 . 7 % ) respondents reported no access to emotional sup - port , 239 ( 6 . 4 % ) felt angry about the pandemic , and 579 ( 15 . 4 % ) experienced loneliness . Compared to people without PTSS , people with PTSS were significantly more likely to be younger ( 36 . 7 ( 11 . 2 ) years vs 39 . 8 ( 11 . 6 ) years ; p < 0 . 001 ) , female , have no for - mal education , and unemployed . People who experienced symptoms of COVID - 19 without being tested , had a close friend who had not tested positive for COVID - 19 , or did not know someone who died of COVID - 19 were also significantly more likely to have PTSS . People who reported not wearing face masks , not washing or sanitis - ing hands frequently , not practicing physical distancing , and not working remotely from home were significantly more likely to have PTSS . Further , those who felt socially isolated , had no emotional support , and those who felt angry or lonely were more significantly more likely to have PTSS . Results from the regression model are shown in Table 2 . Feeling socially isolated ( AOR : 1 . 16 ; 95 % CI : 1 . 12 - 1 . 19 ; p < 0 . 001 ) , angry ( AOR : 2 . 64 ; 95 % CI : 1 . 86 - 3 . 76 ; p < 0 . 001 ) , lonely ( AOR : 2 . 19 ; 95 % CI : 1 . 77 - 2 . 70 ; p < 0 . 001 ) , and hav - ing symptoms of COVID - 19 but not getting tested ( AOR : 2 . 20 ; 95 % CI : 1 . 72 - 2 . 80 ; p < 0 . 001 ) were significantly asso - ciated with higher odds of reporting PTSS . The only COVID - 19 preventive measure associated with PTSS was wearing facemasks , where respondents who reported wearing face masks had significantly lower odds of reporting PTSS ( AOR : 0 . 62 ; 95 % CI : 0 . 50 - 0 . 78 ; p < 0 . 001 ) . Living with HIV ( AOR : 0 . 39 ; 95 % CI : 0 . 31 - 0 . 47 ; p < 0 . 001 ) , having access to emotional support ( AOR : 0 . 63 ; 95 % CI : 0 . 46 - 0 . 85 ; p = 0 . 002 ) , being younger ( AOR : 098 ; 95 % CI : 0 . 97 - 0 . 99 . p < 0 . 001 ) , being male ( AOR : 0 . 85 ; 95 % CI : 0 . 74 - 0 . 98 ; p = 0 . 029 ) , having primary , second - ary or tertiary education ( p < 0 . 05 ) and being employed ( AOR : 0 . 73 ; 95 % CI : 0 . 62 - 0 . 87 ; p < 0 . 001 ) were signifi - cantly associated with lower odds of reporting PTSS . Page 5 of 10 Folayan et al . BMC Psychiatry ( 2022 ) 22 : 48 Discussion In this study , PTSS was found to be associated with feeling angry , lonely , and socially isolated during the COVID - 19 pandemic among adults in Nigeria . The only COVID - 19 prevention strategy associated with PTSS was wearing facemasks with those who wore face masks having lower odds of PTSS . People who had access to emotional support and PLHIV also had lower odds of PTSS . The study hypotheses were therefore only partially supported . This study is one of the few providing empirical evi - dence on the factors associated with PTSS during the COVID - 19 pandemic and the first to identify an associa - tion in an African population . It is also the first to discuss PTSS among PLHIV during the COVID - 19 pandemic in a region of the world with the highest prevalence and burden of HIV [ 51 ] . The large sample size and small con - fidence intervals support the precision of the study esti - mates . However , one of the limitations of this study is that it used a convenient sample with greater represen - tation of persons with tertiary education . The study out - come may therefore be less generalizable to people with lower or non - formal education in Nigeria . This is also a cross - sectional study and so we are unable to conclude on a causal relationship between PTSS and the explana - tory variables studied . Exposure to potentially traumatic events such as violence , assault , abuse , or combat were not measured in this study , thus other factors may con - tribute to the PTSS variance in the sample . Nevertheless , the study findings are consistent with some prior study findings which may support the validity of results to plan interventions for Nigerians during the ongoing COVID - 19 pandemic . The associations found between PTSS and anger , lone - liness , and social isolation during the COVID - 19 pan - demic are supported by prior studies conducted before Table 1 Profile of respondents and associations with post traumatic stress symptoms among respondents N = 3761 Variables Total N = 3761 n ( % ) PTSS P value Yes 1787n ( % ) No 1974n ( % ) Sex at birth Male 1759 ( 46 . 8 ) 780 ( 44 . 3 ) 979 ( 55 . 7 ) 0 . 002 Female 1983 ( 52 . 7 ) 997 ( 50 . 3 ) 986 ( 49 . 7 ) Intersex 2 ( 0 . 1 ) 2 ( 100 . 0 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) Decline to answer 17 ( 0 . 5 ) 8 ( 47 . 1 ) 9 ( 52 . 9 ) Highest educational level No formal education 45 ( 1 . 2 ) 40 ( 88 . 9 ) 5 ( 11 . 1 ) < 0 . 001 Primary 74 ( 2 . 0 ) 51 ( 68 . 9 ) 23 ( 31 . 1 ) Secondary 594 ( 15 . 8 ) 368 ( 62 . 0 ) ) 226 ( 38 . 0 ) Tertiary 3048 ( 81 . 0 ) 1328 ( 43 . 6 ) 1720 ( 56 . 4 ) Employment status Unemployed 568 ( 15 . 1 ) 373 ( 65 . 7 ) 195 ( 34 . 3 ) < 0 . 001 Employed 2677 ( 71 . 2 ) 1138 ( 42 . 5 ) 1539 ( 57 . 5 ) Student 423 ( 11 . 2 ) 239 ( 56 . 5 ) 184 ( 43 . 5 ) Retired 93 ( 2 . 5 ) 37 ( 39 . 8 ) 56 ( 60 . 2 ) COVID - 19 status Tested positive for COVID - 19 No 3667 ( 97 . 5 ) 1749 ( 47 . 7 ) 1918 ( 52 . 3 ) 0 . 163 Yes 94 ( 2 . 5 ) 38 ( 40 . 4 ) 56 ( 59 . 6 ) Had symptoms but no test No 3364 ( 89 . 4 ) 1526 ( 45 . 4 ) 1838 ( 54 . 6 ) < 0 . 001 Yes 397 ( 10 . 6 ) 261 ( 65 . 7 ) 136 ( 34 . 3 ) Had a close friend who tested positive No 3126 ( 83 . 1 ) 1520 ( 48 . 6 ) 1606 ( 51 . 4 ) 0 . 002 Yes 635 ( 16 . 9 ) 267 ( 42 . 0 ) 368 ( 58 . 0 ) Knew someone who died of COVID - 19 No 2569 ( 68 . 3 ) 1265 ( 49 . 2 ) 1304 ( 50 . 8 ) 0 . 002 Yes 1192 ( 31 . 7 ) 522 ( 43 . 8 ) 670 ( 56 . 2 ) HIV status Not living with HIV 2965 ( 78 . 8 ) 1245 ( 42 . 0 ) 1720 ( 58 . 0 ) < 0 . 001 Living with HIV 796 ( 21 . 2 ) 542 ( 68 . 1 ) 254 ( 31 . 9 ) COVID - 19 preventive measures Wearing face masks No 596 ( 15 . 8 ) 343 ( 57 . 6 ) 253 ( 42 . 4 ) < 0 . 001 Yes 3165 ( 84 . 2 ) 1444 ( 45 . 6 ) 1721 ( 54 . 4 ) Frequent hand washing and sanitising No 655 ( 17 . 4 ) 349 ( 53 . 3 ) 306 ( 46 . 7 ) 0 . 001 Yes 3106 ( 82 . 6 ) 1438 ( 46 . 3 ) 1668 ( 53 . 7 ) Physical distancing No 876 ( 23 . 3 ) 469 ( 53 . 5 ) 407 ( 46 . 5 ) < 0 . 001 Yes 2885 ( 76 . 7 ) 1318 ( 45 . 7 ) 1567 ( 54 . 3 ) Working remotely No 2515 ( 66 . 9 ) 1241 ( 49 . 3 ) 1274 ( 50 . 7 ) 0 . 001 Yes 1246 ( 33 . 1 ) 546 ( 43 . 8 ) 700 ( 56 . 2 ) Social isolation Mean ( SD ) 5 . 1 ( 2 . 6 ) 5 . 7 ( 2 . 4 ) 4 . 6 ( 2 . 6 ) < 0 . 001 Table 1 ( continued ) Variables Total N = 3761 n ( % ) PTSS P value Yes 1787n ( % ) No 1974n ( % ) Access to emotional support No 289 ( 7 . 7 ) 212 ( 73 . 4 ) 77 ( 26 . 6 ) < 0 . 001 Yes 3472 ( 92 . 3 ) 1575 ( 45 . 4 ) 1897 ( 54 . 6 ) Anger No 3522 ( 93 . 6 ) 1596 ( 45 . 3 ) 1926 ( 54 . 7 ) < 0 . 001 Yes 239 ( 6 . 4 ) 191 ( 79 . 9 ) 48 ( 20 . 1 ) Loneliness No 3182 ( 84 . 6 ) 1378 ( 43 . 3 ) 1804 ( 56 . 7 ) < 0 . 001 Yes 579 ( 15 . 4 ) 409 ( 70 . 6 ) 170 ( 29 . 4 ) Page 6 of 10 Folayan et al . BMC Psychiatry ( 2022 ) 22 : 48 [ 52 – 54 ] and during [ 9 , 55 ] the pandemic that show simi - lar associations . The protracted duration of the COVID - 19 pandemic has implications for the persistence of these associations over time . Sensitization and kindling may cause the progressive escalation of PTSS , and with time , may lead to the onset of PTSD [ 56 ] . Repeated environ - mental triggering of traumatic memories increases the dysregulation of individuals’ neurobiology resulting in chronic musculoskeletal pain , hypertension , hyper - lipidaemia , obesity , and cardiovascular disease [ 57 ] . It is therefore important for governments to put in place pub - lic health outreach and support mechanisms for people who feel anger , loneliness , and social isolation during the COVID - 19 pandemic [ 57 ] . Because the Nigerian govern - ment is largely dependent on donor support for its health response , Nigeria’s COVID - 19 response basket fund and other sources of donor funding [ 58 ] may best be utilised to address potential gaps in providing mental health sup - port for those in need of this support during a pandemic . Furthermore , we found that having access to emotional support during the COVID - 19 pandemic was associated with lower odds of PTSS . This is similar to prior findings on the association between PTSD and disastrous events [ 59 ] as well as PTSD and the COVID - 19 pandemic [ 60 ] . Emotional support enhances resilience [ 61 ] , while pre - event emotional support creates a buffer - effect and miti - gates against post - event PTSD [ 62 , 63 ] . According to our study findings , PTSS may be associ - ated with low use of face mask . As of June 2021 , less than 5 % of the population in Nigeria was vaccinated against COVID - 19 infection [ 64 ] . Thus , the country may face multiple cycles of the pandemic because of the large proportion of persons not using face masks in addition to low vaccination rates . This is an important reason for health policy planners in Nigeria to urgently address the mental health needs of people with PTSS to prevent new waves of COVID - 19 infection . There is also a need for public health education to use facemasks in addition to programs to prevent , diagnose and treat PTSD at com - munity level since the utilisation of health care services is poor in Nigeria [ 65 – 67 ] . Being male , having a level of formal education , and having employment were associated with lower odds of having PTSS . Some studies indicate that PTSD is more common in females because they have a more sensitized hypothalamus – pituitary – axis than males [ 68 ] . Other sex and gender differences in brain function and behaviour also elevate the risk for PTSD in women compared to men . Women report experiencing more high - impact trauma at a younger age compared to men and have an associated increase in need for social sup - port [ 68 ] . The finding is in line with a study on the inci - dence of PTSD in Italy where women displayed higher level of anxiety during the pandemic [ 63 ] . Also , higher education status improves employment opportunity and socio - economic status thereby enabling individuals to gain access to social and economic resources to cope with pandemic related stress [ 69 ] . In Nigeria , females are more economically and socially disadvantaged than men [ 70 ] , which further increases their predisposition Table 2 Logistic regressions analysis of the factors associated with post traumatic stress symptoms ( N = 3761 ) Variables AOR ( 95 % CI ) p value Age in years 0 . 98 ( 0 . 97‑0 . 99 ) < 0 . 001 Sex at birth Male ( ref : non‑male ) 0 . 85 ( 0 . 74‑0 . 98 ) 0 . 029 Highest educational level No formal education 1 . 00 Primary 0 . 30 ( 0 . 10‑0 . 92 ) 0 . 035 Secondary 0 . 29 ( 0 . 11‑0 . 78 ) 0 . 015 Tertiary 0 . 26 ( 0 . 10‑0 . 71 ) 0 . 008 Employment status Employed 0 . 73 ( 0 . 62‑0 . 87 ) < 0 . 001 COVID - 19 status Tested positive for COVID - 19 Yes ( ref : no ) 0 . 69 ( 0 . 43‑1 . 11 ) 0 . 124 Had symptoms but no test Yes ( ref : no ) 2 . 20 ( 1 . 72‑2 . 80 ) < 0 . 001 Had a close friend who tested positive Yes ( ref : no ) 0 . 93 ( 0 . 76‑1 . 15 ) 0 . 513 Knew someone who died of COVID - 19 Yes ( ref : no ) 1 . 10 ( 0 . 93‑1 . 29 ) 0 . 270 HIV status Living with HIV 0 . 39 ( 0 . 31‑0 . 47 ) < 0 . 001 COVID - 19 preventive measures Wearing face masks Yes ( ref : no ) 0 . 62 ( 0 . 50‑0 . 78 ) < 0 . 001 Hand washing Yes ( ref : no ) 0 . 95 ( 0 . 76‑1 . 19 ) 0 . 652 Physical distancing Yes ( ref : no ) 1 . 10 ( 0 . 92‑1 . 31 ) 0 . 308 Working remotely Yes ( ref : no ) 1 . 08 ( 0 . 92‑1 . 27 ) 0 . 332 Social Isolation 1 . 16 ( 1 . 12‑1 . 19 ) < 0 . 001 Access to emotional support Yes ( ref : no ) 0 . 63 ( 0 . 46‑0 . 85 ) 0 . 002 Anger Yes ( ref : no ) 2 . 64 ( 1 . 86‑3 . 76 ) < 0 . 001 Loneliness Yes ( ref : no ) 2 . 19 ( 1 . 77‑2 . 70 ) < 0 . 001 Nagelkerke R 2 0 . 217 Omnibus test of model coefficients 668 . 58 < 0 . 001 Page 7 of 10 Folayan et al . BMC Psychiatry ( 2022 ) 22 : 48 to PTSD . Prior research indicated that low educational status can be a significant risk indicator for PTSD in adults [ 71 ] . This combination of predisposing factors for higher prevalence of PTSD in females during the COVID - 19 pandemic is an indication of the need for a gender sensitive COVID - 19 response for adults in Nigeria . Our findings show that being younger was associated with higher odds of having PTSS . Younger people may experience more PTSD during disasters [ 63 , 71 ] because older age promotes more adaptive coping styles [ 63 , 72 ] . Also , younger individuals are more vulnerable to differ - ent dimensions of psychological distress than older gen - erations , are least prepared to face trauma , or may be more informed about the nature of Coronavirus than their older counterparts [ 63 ] . The effect of disasters may , however , be more dependent on the social , economic , cultural , and historical context of the disaster - stricken setting than with age [ 72 ] even during the COVID - 19 pandemic [ 73 ] and thus , findings on age associated PTSS during the pandemic may possibly vary between cultures and countries . Also , age - associated PTSD has been found for females and not for males [ 74 ] thereby increasing the possibility for a non - linear relationship between age and PTSS . Study findings indicated that respondents who had symptoms of COVID - 19 , but were not tested , had higher odds of having PTSS . The relationship between the two variables may be bidirectional , as not testing may be a result of PTSS while PTSS may also result in people with symptoms who do not test . People who had symptoms of COVID - 19 , but did not test may be concerned with the consequences of confirming COVID - 19 infection . Fear , anxiety , anger , depression , and guilt are common reac - tions to COVID - 19 infection as well as trauma . Although most people exposed to trauma do not develop long - term PTSD , getting timely help and support may prevent stress reactions from getting worse and developing into PTSD . Possible sources of support such as peers , family , and the faith community may be empowered so that they are available to prevent people turning to unhealthy cop - ing methods such as misuse of alcohol or drugs [ 75 ] . The low numbers of confirmed COVID - 19 cases compared to those suspected of having COVID - 19 but not tested points to the low level of testing in Nigeria like many low - and middle - income countries [ 25 ] . Understanding the association reported here may help with the development of policies and guidelines on COVID - 19 testing that may help improve the COVID - 19 testing in Nigeria and other low - and middle - income countries . Incongruously , living with HIV was associated with lower odds of having PTSS . HIV and COVID - 19 inter - sectional studies had indicated the increased risk of PTSD for PLHIV who have experienced traumatic events like intimate partner violence , isolation , discrimination , stigma , and challenges with obtaining treatment [ 76 ] . Although we did not explore the history of traumatic events for respondents living with HIV in this study , past studies have indicated that PLHIV are at high risk of facing these traumatic events [ 77 , 78 ] . However , it is also possible that years of experience handling traumatic events may have helped PLHIV develop a positive sense of self , relationship , philosophy of life , and trauma cop - ing strategies for COVID - 19 related trauma [ 79 ] . PLHIV may therefore be more resilient to the shocks associated with the pandemic and resilience can reduce the risk for PTSD [ 80 ] . This study provides evidence suggestive of the need for a policy thrust that recognises the mental health and emotion related complications that may have resulted from the COVID - 19 directives , and the need to put in place supportive systems and structures to address these complications . Policies need to be based on empathy . A whole - of - society approach need to be instituted to pro - mote , protect , and care for mental health in addition to ensuring widespread availability of emergency men - tal health and psychosocial support mechanisms and systems through collaborative efforts with civil society organisations ; many of whom remain the first responders in the time of crisis [ 81 ] . The current national responses did not include programs for access to mental health ser - vices . In the future , it is important to plan for citizens’ recovery from health crisis like that witnessed during the COVID - 19 pandemic by building and ensuring access to mental health services . Conclusion The high prevalence of PTSS , low level of wearing face - mask by persons with PTSS , and positive associations between PTSS and HIV status , anger , loneliness , social isolation , and access to emotional support during this protracted COVID - 19 pandemic has implications for the future health of affected persons . This is particularly sali - ent for individuals living in Nigeria , where public health education and support for the use of facemask should be incorporated into programs targeting the prevention , diagnosis , and treatment for PTSD and PTSS at the com - munity level .
