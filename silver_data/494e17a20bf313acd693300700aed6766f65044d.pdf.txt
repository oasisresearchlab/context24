Virga † Dipartimento di Matematica , Universit ` a di Pavia , Via Ferrata 5 , 27100 Pavia , Italy ( Dated : March 30 , 2021 ) We study droplets of chromonic liquid crystals squeezed between parallel plates inducing degen - erate tangential anchoring on the nematic director . In the coexistence regime , where droplets in the nematic phase are at equilibrium with the surrounding melt , our two - dimensional theoretical model predicts a regime of shape bistability for suﬃciently large bipolar droplets , where tactoids ( pointed shapes ) and discoids ( smooth shapes ) coexist in equilibrium . This phenomenon has not yet been observed . Two - dimensional droplets of disodium cromoglycate ( DSCG ) have been the object of a thorough experimental study [ Y . - K . Kim et al . , J . Phys . : Condens . Matter 25 , 404202 ( 2013 ) ] . We show that our theory is in good quantitative agreement with these data and extract from them what promises to be a more accurate estimate for the isotropic surface tension at the nematic / melt interface of DSCG . I . INTRODUCTION Chromonic liquid crystals ( CLC ) , also called chromonics , form a very peculiar class of liquid crystals ( LC ) . These latter are systems constituted by basic mesogens ( either single molecules or molecular assemblies ) , which possess orientational ordering , and sometimes—under appropriate circumstances—also positional ordering . Basically , there exist two classes of LCs : thermotropic LCs , in which the ordering process is temperature - driven , and lyotropic LCs , in which the mesogenic units are molecular assemblies in a solvent , and concentration is the driving parameter for ordering . These latter are found in detergents and living organisms alike [ 1 ] . In particular , CLCs are lyotropics formed by certain dyes , drugs , and short nucleic - acid oligomers in aqueous solutions [ 2 – 7 ] Since most biological processes take function normally in these types of solutions , it is no wonder that interest in CLCs has recently surged for possible applications in medical sciences . But this is not the only reason that makes them special ( or rather unique ) . A number of informative , updated reviews are available on this topic [ 2 , 8 – 11 ] ; they are all highly recommended . In ordinary lyotropic LCs , the aggregated molecules are bonded so strongly that neither size nor shape of the assemblies change appreciably upon varying moderately both temperature and concentration . Quite to the contrary , in CLCs , aggregation starts at very low concentrations . CLC molecules are typically plank - shaped with aromatic cores and polar groups on their peripheries [ 12 ] . They tend to stack face - to - face so as to form columns that order into a ﬂuid nematic phase or ( for higher concentrations or lower temperatures ) even in a solid - like medium phase , where columns are organized parallel to one another with their centres arranged in an hexagonal pattern [ 2 ] . The former phase is just the analogue of the nematic phase in ordinary thermotropics , whilst the latter is the analogue of the columnar phase in discotic thermotropics . It is the variability in size and shape of the supra - molecular columns that makes CLCs so unique . There is also a wide variety of situations in the molecular organization : some are stacks of single molecules , others have more than a molecule in their cross - sections [ 1 ] . These might seem to be minor details , but they may have momentous consequences at the macroscopic scale [ 13 ] . The aggregation process is often called isodesmic , because the energy gain in adding a unit to a preexisting column ( typically between 5 and 10 kT ) does not depend on the length of the column . The isodesmic nature of the process results in a broad length column distribution , which is prone to the action of temperature . When the temperature is increased , the concentration of longer assemblies decreases . This is reﬂected by the elastic properties of the phase , in a way that ordinary lyotropics do not exhibit [ 12 ] . Further increasing the temperature results into a ﬁrst order nematic - isotropic transition with a wide coexistence region ( 5 - 10 ◦ C ) . Conversely , when the temperature is decreased , short , disordered columns in the isotropic phase tend to grow and aggregate , eventually separating from the parent isotropic melt to form islands of ordered phase . As customary , the nematic phase is described by the extra director ﬁeld n , which represents at the macroscopic level the local orientation of the supra - molecular rod - like aggregates . At the nematic / isotropic interface , an orientation - dependent surface tension arises that favours the ( degenerate ) tangential orientation of n , in agreement with the purely ∗ paparinisilvia @ gmail . com † eg . virga @ unipv . it 2 entropic argument of Onsager [ 14 ] , according to which a tangential anchoring would enhance the local translational freedom of columns at the interface . We shall only be concerned with a two - dimensional problem , inspired by the experimental setting explored by Kim et al . [ 15 ] . There , CLC droplets in the nematic phase appeared surrounded by the isotropic phase , their shape being the characteristic tactoids ( spindle - like ) that were observed in aqueous dispersions of tobacco mosaic viruses since the seminal paper by Bernal and Fankuchen [ 16 ] . Most reported droplets were bipolar , with point defects of n at the pointed poles . In this paper , we adapt to the two - dimensional setting our theory for the representation of tactoids recently presented in [ 17 ] . We shall achieve two main results . First , we predict a shape bistability , which seems characteristic of the two - dimensional setting . We identify a range of droplet’s areas where two distinct shapes could be observed , one tactoidal , as expected , and the other discoidal ( smooth ) . A sort of shape coexistence thus parallels the phase coexistence observed in these materials . This regime manifests itself for droplets larger than those reported in [ 15 ] ; to our knowledge , it has not yet been observed . Second , we use the very detailed data of [ 15 ] to compare the observed shapes with those predicted by our theory . We extract an estimate for the isotropic component of the surface tension at the droplet’s interface , which turns out to comparable in order of magnitude to the typical values measured for standard thermotropic materials ( ∼ 10 − 5 J / m 2 , see [ 18 , p . 495 ] ) . The paper is organized as follows . In Sec . II , we recall from [ 17 ] our theory and adapt it to the present two - dimensional setting . The optimal shapes of bipolar droplets that minimize the total free - energy functional are derived and discussed in Sec . III , where we illustrate in detail the bistability scenario that we envision . We show , in particular , how the critical values of the droplet’s area that delimit the corresponding shape hysteresis depend on the elastic constants of the material . Section IV is devoted to the comparison with the experimental study [ 15 ] that has motivated this work . We contrast our predicted shapes to the observed ones and , encouraged by their agreement , we estimate the isotropic component of the surface tension . Finally , in Sec . V , we summarize our conclusions and comment on possible further extensions of our study . The paper is closed by two mathematical appendices , where we collect computational details and auxiliary results needed in the main text , but inessential to its comprehension . II . TWO - DIMENSIONAL SETTING Here , we set our theoretical scene ; we shall ﬁrst recall the energetics of a CLC drop squeezed between two parallel plates and we shall then describe both its outer proﬁle and inner direction ﬁeld . A . Energetics In classical liquid crystal theory , the nematic director ﬁeld n describes the average of the molecules that constitute the material . The elastic distortions of n are locally measured by its gradient ∇ n , which may become singular where the director exhibits defects , that is , discontinuities in the ﬁeld n . The bulk free energy is the following functional , F b [ B , n ] : = Z B f OF ( n , ∇ n ) d V , ( 1 ) where B is the region occupied by the material , d V is the volume element , and f OF is the Oseen - Frank free - energy density . Letting the latter be the most general frame - indiﬀerent function , even in n and quadratic in ∇ n , one arrives at ( see , e . g . , [ 19 , Ch . 3 ] ) f OF : = 1 2 K 11 ( div n ) 2 + 1 2 K 22 ( n · curl n ) 2 + 1 2 K 33 | n × curl n | 2 + K 24 (cid:0) tr ( ∇ n ) 2 − ( div n ) 2 (cid:1) , ( 2 ) where K 11 , K 22 , K 33 , and K 24 are the splay , twist , bend , and saddle - splay elastic constants , respectively . They are material moduli characteristic of each nematic liquid crystal , corresponding to four independent orientation ﬁelds , each igniting a single distinctive term in ( 2 ) . 1 The energy f OF is meant to penalize all distortions of n away from the unifom alignment ( in whatever direction ) ; to this end , the elastic constants in ( 2 ) must satisfy Ericksen’s inequalities [ 22 ] , K 11 ≧ K 24 ≧ 0 , K 22 ≧ K 24 ≧ 0 , K 33 ≧ 0 . ( 3 ) 1 Recently , an equivalent modal decomposition has been put forward for f OF [ 20 ] , which has also been given a graphical representation in terms of an octupolar tensor [ 21 ] . 3 CLCs in three - dimensional space exhibit a diﬀerent behavior : in cylindrical capillary tubes subject to degenerate tangential boundary conditions , 2 the director n has been seen to steer away from the uniform alignment along the cylinder’s axis [ 23 – 27 ] . Two symmetric twisted conﬁgurations ( left - and right - handed ) have been observed in capillaries , each variant occurring with the same likelihood , as was to be expected from the lack of chirality in the molecular aggregates that constitute these materials . Despite the clear indication that CLC’s ground state diﬀers from the uniform alignment presumed in f OF , the Oseen - Frank theory has been applied to rationalize the experiments with capillary tubes [ 23 – 26 ] , at the cost of taking K 22 < K 24 , which violates one of Ericksen’s inequalities ( 3 ) . Since such a violation would make f OF unbounded below , the legitimacy of these theoretical treatments is threatened by a number of mathematical issues that will be tackled elsewhere [ 28 ] . Here , we can spare this issue , as our setting is two - dimensional . The region B will be a thin blob representing a droplet of CLC surrounded by its isotropic melt , squeezed between two parallel plates at the distance h from one another . Formally , B = R × [ − h 2 , h 2 ] , where R is a region with piecewise smooth boundary ∂ R in the ( x , y ) plane of a Cartesian frame ( e x , e y , e z ) ( see Fig . 1 ) . The ﬁeld n lies in the same plane as R and it is thought of as being Figure 1 : Two - dimensional domain R with area A 0 in the ( x , y ) plane . It represents the cross - section of a drop squeezed between two parallel substrates h apart and surrounded laterally by the isotropic phase . In accord with the experimental observations in [ 15 ] , both shape and director ﬁeld are uniform across the gap of thickness h along e z . extended uniformly through the blob’s thickness . For a planar ﬁeld of this sort , the twist term in ( 2 ) vanishes identically , as curl n k e z , and so the twist constant K 22 will play no role here ( and those Ericksen’s inequalities that involve it can altogether be ignored ) . Thus , leaving aside the possibly controversial issue arising in general from the violation of one Ericksen’s inequality , we remain assured that in the present setting the Oseen - Frank energy - density f OF is bounded below and the free energy F b can be safely minimized . We assume that a given mass of material constitute the blob B , and so its volume V 0 is prescribed by the in - compressibility constraint ( which is satisﬁed to a large degree of approximation ) . Consequently , the area A 0 of R is prescribed , as V 0 = A 0 h . We further assume that the plates squeezing both B and the surrounding melt exert a degenerate tangential anchoring on the nematic director n , so that , in light of the constraint on the area of R , the additional anchoring energy can be treated as an inessential additive constant . This is not the case for the surface energy F s at the interface between B and the surrounding melt . Here we assume that this energy is represented by the Rapini - Papoular formula [ 29 ] , F s [ R , n ] = h Z ∂ R γ ( 1 + ω ( n · ν ) 2 ) d A , ( 4 ) where γ > 0 is the isotropic surface tension of the liquid crystal in contact with its melt , ω is a dimensionless anchoring strength , which we take to satisfy ω ≧ 0 , ν is the outer unit normal to ∂ R , and d A is the area element . Thus F s is minimized when n lies tangent to ∂ R . Henceforth , we shall enforce this minimum requirement as a constraint on n , n · ν ≡ 0 , on ∂ R , ( 5 ) save checking ultimately this assumption with appropriate energy comparisons ( see Appendix B ) which ensures that such a tangential anchoring is not broken . In short , the validity of ( 5 ) requires that the droplet is not too small in a sense that will be made precise below . 2 That is , when n is bound to be tangent to the boundary , but oriented in any direction . 4 To sum up , the total free energy F : = F b + F s of the system is given by the functional F [ R , n ] : = h (cid:18)Z R f OF d A + γℓ ( ∂ R ) (cid:19) , ( 6 ) subject to ( 5 ) and to the isoperimetric constraint A ( R ) = A 0 , ( 7 ) where A and ℓ are the area and length measures , respectively . B . Admissible Shapes No preferred direction is present on the substrates that squeeze the drop , and so , contemplating tactoids among the possible equilibrium shapes of R ( as well as other smooth shapes ) , we assume that these are mirror symmetric about two orthogonal axes , one joining the possible sharp tips of the boundary ∂ R . We denote by y the latter axis and by x the orthogonal symmetry axis . 3 Thus , only half of the curve that bounds R needs to be described , the other half being obtained by mirror symmetry . We take this curve to be represented as x = R ( y ) , where y ranges in the interval [ − R 0 , R 0 ] , with R 0 to be determined , and R is a smooth , even function such that R ( R 0 ) = 0 and R ′ ( 0 ) = 0 , ( 8 ) where a prime ′ denotes diﬀerentiation with respect to y ( see Fig . 2 ) . The points where R vanishes correspond to the Figure 2 : The function R ( y ) and its retraction R t ( y ) = g ( t ) R ( y ) represent ( half ) the boundary ∂ R and retracted inner curves ∂ R t for generic t ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] . The nematic director n is the unit vector ﬁeld everywhere tangent to the retracted curves ; n ⊥ = e z × n is the orthogonal ﬁeld , and ν is the outer unit normal to ∂ R , where ν = − n ⊥ . The function R represents half a drop ; the other half is obtained by mirror symmetry about the y axis . poles of R . Whenever R ′ ( R 0 ) is ﬁnite , R represents a tactoid , as the outer unit normal ν to ∂ R is discontinuous at the poles . Smooth shapes correspond to R ′ ( R 0 ) = −∞ . We call R e the radius of the equivalent disc , which has area A 0 , and we denote by µ the dimensionless length of the semi - axis of the drop , µ : = R 0 R e . ( 9 ) 3 Clearly , due to the absence of a privileged orientation on the bounding substrates , the y axis could indeed be oriented in any direction . If several drops are present , their axes would be isotropically distributed . 5 Hereafter , we shall rescale all lengths to R e ( while keeping their names unchanged , to avoid typographical clutter ) . With this normalization , the area constraint ( 7 ) reads simply as Z µ − µ R ( y ) d z = π 2 . ( 10 ) C . Director Retraction The shape of R is unknown and needs to be determined . Since n is tangent to ∂ R , following [ 17 ] we device a method that also derives n inside R from the knowledge of ∂ R , thus reducing the total free energy F to a pure shape functional . This is achieved by retracting ∂ R inside R with its tangent ﬁeld n . Formally , we deﬁne a function R t ( y ) = g ( t ) R ( y ) , where t ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] and g is an increasing monotonic function such that g ( 0 ) = 0 and g ( 1 ) = 1 . The graph of R t , shown in Fig . 2 , represents the retraction of ∂ R that borders an inner domain R t ⊆ R . All domains R t are nested one inside the other as t decreases towards 0 . For t = 0 , R t reduces to the y axis . The advantage of this method is that it also aﬀords to describe the inner director n as the ﬁeld everywhere tangent to the family of curves ∂ R t . All director ﬁelds obtained by this geometric construction are bipolar , in that they have two point defects at the poles ; in the language of Mermin [ 30 ] , they are boojums with topological charge m = + 1 ( see also [ 18 , p . 501 ] ) . It is shown in Appendix A how to compute the area element d A in the ( t , y ) coordinates and how to express ∇ n in the orthonormal frame ( n , n ⊥ ) , where n ⊥ : = e z × n , in terms of the functions R ( y ) and g ( t ) . In the rescaled variables y and R ( y ) , an appropriate dimensionless form of F in ( 6 ) is then given by F [ µ ; R ] : = F [ B ] K 11 h = Z µ − µ (cid:26)(cid:20) R ′ R − R ′′ R ′ + 1 8 RR ′′ 2 R ′ 3 ( 3 + k 3 ) (cid:21) arctan R ′ + R ′′ 1 + R ′ 2 + + 1 8 RR ′′ 2 ( 1 + R ′ 2 ) 2 (cid:20) ( k 3 − 5 ) − 1 R ′ 2 ( k 3 + 3 ) (cid:21)(cid:27) + 2 α p 1 + R ′ 2 d y , ( 11 ) where k 3 : = K 33 K 11 ( 12 ) is a reduced bend constant and α : = γR e K 11 ( 13 ) is a reduced area . Equivalently , α = R e / ξ e , where ξ e is the de Gennes - Kleman extrapolation length [ 18 , p . 159 ] . 4 The reduced functional F in ( 11 ) suﬀers from a typical pathology of two - dimensional director theory : it diverges logarithmically to + ∞ near defects . Here , the culprit is the integrand R ′ R arctan R ′ , which is not integrable at y = ± µ . Following a well established practice ( see , e . g . , [ 31 , p . 171 ] ) , we imagine that the energy concentration near defects causes a localized transition to the isotropic phase , which constitutes a defect core ( whose ﬁne structure is better explored within Ericksen’s theory [ 32 ] ) . The energy associated with such a phase transition is proportional to the core’s area and will be taken as approximately ﬁxed . Moreover , for simplicity , instead of considering a circular core , which in the most common choice , we take it in the shape of the tapering drop’s tip . Letting r c denote the core’s size , we set r c = εR e and restrict y to the interval [ − η , + η ] , where η is deﬁned by R ( η ) = R ( − η ) = ε , ( 14 ) and so depends indirectly on ε ( see Fig . 3 ) . For R e of the order of 10 µ m , it is reasonable to take ε ≈ 10 − 3 , as we shall do here , which corresponds to r c of the order of 10nm . The integral in ( 11 ) will hereafter be limited to the interval [ − η , + η ] , so that it will always converge . The extra energy stored in the defects , being approximately constant , will play no role in our quest for the equilibrium shape of squeezed drops . 4 Thus , when we say that a drop is either small or large , we mean precisely that either α ≪ 1 or α ≫ 1 , respectively . 6 Figure 3 : Isotropic defect core ( in red ) at the tip of a drop ( only a quarter is shown ) . In our dimensionless units ( rescaled to R e ) , η is deﬁned by ( 14 ) . A sensible value for the parameter ε , which here is out of scale , is ε ≈ 10 − 3 . A similar construction also applies to a drop with smooth poles ( not shown here ) . D . Special Family of Shapes Here , we follow closely [ 17 ] , albeit in a two - dimensional setting , in an attempt to restrict the admissible shapes of drops to a special family amenable to a simple analytical treatment . The admissible drop proﬁles will be described by the function 5 R ( y ) = a ( µ 2 − y 2 ) + b p µ 2 − y 2 , ( 15 ) where a and b are real parameters that must be chosen subject to the requirements that R ( y ) ≧ 0 for all − µ ≦ y ≦ µ and that ( 10 ) is satisﬁed . It is a simple matter to show ( see also [ 17 ] ) that a and b can be expressed in terms of the free parameters ( φ , µ ) that span the conﬁguration space S : = { ( φ , µ ) : 0 ≦ φ ≦ 3 π 4 , µ > 0 } . Precisely , a = 1 µ 3 π cos φ h ( φ ) , b = 1 µ 2 π sin φ h ( φ ) with h ( φ ) : = 8 3 cos φ + π sin φ > 0 , 0 ≦ φ ≦ 3 π 4 . ( 16 ) Shapes with diﬀerent qualitative features correspond to diﬀerent regions of S , as illustrated in Fig . 4 . Prolate shapes are characterized by µ ≧ ̟ ( φ ) : = s π ( cos φ + sin φ ) h ( φ ) , ( 17 ) whereas oblate shapes are characterized by µ < ̟ ( φ ) . Moreover , shapes represented by ( 16 ) are convex for 0 ≦ φ ≦ φ c : = arccot (cid:0) − 12 (cid:1) . = 2 . 03 and concave for φ c < φ ≦ 3 π 4 . The latter are represented by the red strip in Fig . 4 ; we call them butterﬂies : their waist narrows as φ approaches the boundary of S at φ = 3 π 4 , where it vanishes altogether and the droplet splits in two . R has pointed tips only whenever R ′ ( µ ) is ﬁnite ; according to ( 16 ) , the only value of φ that makes b vanish is φ = 0 . We call genuine these tactoids . For small enough values of φ the shape represented by ( 15 ) via ( 16 ) cannot be visually distinguished from pointed tactoids ; we ﬁnd the conventional barrier at φ = π 16 appropriate to delimit the realm of tactoids ( genuine or not ) . Further increasing φ , R has tips that look smoother , justifying our calling them discoids . A conventional barrier is set at φ = 9 π 16 to mark where discoids evolve into little batons , for which we use the French word bˆatonnet . The names used to identify diﬀerent shapes of R and the corresponding strips in S where they are found are recalled in Table I . Fig . 5 illustrates a gallery of shapes for R obtained from ( 15 ) and ( 16 ) for µ = 1 and a number of values of φ falling in the diﬀerent types listed in Table I . III . OPTIMAL SHAPES This section is devoted to the study of the minimizers of the free - energy functional in ( 11 ) . Our major result will be the prediction of a shape bistability , which has not yet been observed in this setting . Before describing 5 For b = 0 , R in ( 15 ) reduces to he parabolic proﬁle considered in [ 33 ] . 7 Figure 4 : Conﬁguration space with the admissible shapes described by ( 15 ) . The blue region below the graph of the function ̟ ( φ ) in ( 17 ) represents all prolate shapes . The red strip for φ c ≦ φ ≦ 3 π 4 represents the concave shapes that we call butterﬂies ; all shapes falling on the left of this strip are convex . The circular disc is represented by the point ( π 2 , 1 ) , marked by a red circle . We also call tactoids the shapes for 0 ≦ φ ≦ π 16 ( genuine tactoids , only those for φ = 0 , marked by a red line ) , discoids those for π 16 ≦ φ ≦ 9 π 16 , and bˆatonnet those for 9 π 16 ≦ φ ≦ φ c , see also Table I , and Fig . 5 for a fuller gallery of shapes . The barriers marking transitions from one family of shapes to another are represented by vertical dashed lines . Table I : We identify four strips in conﬁguration space S , which correspond to four qualitatively diﬀerent shapes for a region R represented by ( 15 ) via ( 16 ) . Here φ c = arccot (cid:0) − 12 (cid:1) . = 2 . 03 . Tactoids Discoids Bˆatonnet Butterﬂies 0 ≦ φ < π 16 π 16 < φ < 9 π 16 9 π 16 < φ < φ c φ c < φ ≦ 3 π 4 this phenomenon , however , we need to make sure that the droplets we consider are not too small for the tangential anchoring condition in ( 5 ) to be valid . A . Admissible Drop Sizes It is known [ 34 ] that drops suﬃciently small in three - dimensional space tend to break the director’s tangential anchoring on their boundary , favouring the uniform alignment of n in their bulk . A simple heuristic argument tells us that a similar breaking would also take place in the present two - dimensional setting . The elastic cost of the bulk deformation scales as Kh , where K is a typical elastic constant , while the surface anchoring energy scales as γωhR e , and so α ( 13 ) estimates the ratio of the latter to the former . Thus , when α is suﬃciently small , the bulk energy becomes dominant and it is minimized by the uniform alignment of n , which breaks the tangential anchoring , undermining our analysis . In Appendix B , we perform an energy comparison that provides an estimate for the safeguard vale α s of α , above which tangential anchoring is expected to remain unbroken . We 8 ( a ) φ = 0 genuine tactoid ( b ) φ = π 32 tactoid ( c ) φ = π 4 discoid ( d ) φ = 10 π 16 bˆatonnet ( e ) φ = 11 π 16 butterﬂy Figure 5 : Gallery of shapes illustrating for µ = 1 the taxonomy introduced in Table I .

For ω = 5 , which is a choice supported by some evidence , 6 α s ≈ 0 . 2 k 3 − 0 . 5 ( 1 + ln ε ) . In particular , for k 3 = 1 and ε = 10 − 3 , α s ≈ 3 , which will be our reference choice henceforth . Taking K ∼ 1 - 10 pN as typical value for all elastic constants 7 and γ ∼ 10 − 5 J / m 2 as typical value for the surface tension of a chromonic liquid crystal in contact with its melt , 8 by ( 13 ) taking α > 3 means taking R e & 0 . 3 - 3 µ m , which provides a lower bound on the admissible size of the droplets that can be treated within our theory . B . Shape Bistability Finding analytically the minima of the reduced free energy F α ( φ , µ ) , the function deﬁned on the conﬁguration space S by computing the functional F [ µ ; R ] in ( 11 ) on the special family of shapes in ( 15 ) , is simply impracticable . Thus , for a given choice of the elastic parameter k 3 , we evaluated numerically F α and we sought its minimizers in S for increasing α > α s . We found out that there are two critical values of α , α 1 and α 2 > α 1 , such that for either α < α 1 or α > α 2 , F α attains a single ( absolute ) minimum in S , whereas it attains two ( relative ) minima for α 1 ≦ α ≦ α 2 . There is a third critical value , α b ∈ ( α 1 , α 2 ) , such that for α = α b the two minima of F α are equal and its absolute minimizer abruptly shifts from one point in S to another . Were the points of S to represent the diﬀerent phases of a condensed system , this scenario would be described as a ( ﬁrst - order ) phase transition . In our setting , it more simply describes the ( local ) stability of two equilibrium shapes for a squeezed drop : for α 1 < α < α 2 , both a tactoid and a discoid are local energy minimzers , the global minimum shifting from the former to the latter at α = α b . For α < α 1 , the only equilibrium shape is a tactoid , whereas it is a discoid for α > α 2 . The shape bistability exhibited by this two - dimensional system will now be documented in more details . We start by representing the equilibrium landscape in the language of bifurcation theory . Taking α as bifurcation parameter and φ as equilibrium shape representative , in Fig . 6 we illustrate the minima of F α for k 3 = 1 : one falls in 0 < φ < π 16 ( blue line ) , and so it is a tactoid , while the other falls in π 16 < φ < π 2 ( red line ) and is a discoid . Solid lines represent global minima , while broken lines represent local minima . Two separate local minima are also global minima for α = α b , where a perfect bistability is established between the two equilibrium branches . The tacoidal branch can be further continued , as it is locally stable , until α reaches the critical value α 2 , where it ceases to exist altogether . Similarly , as soon as α exceeds α 1 , the discoidal branch comes ﬁrst into life as a locally stable equilibrium , which then becomes globally stable for α > α b . For α ∈ [ α 1 , α 2 ] , tactoids and discoids coexist as optimal shapes ; both are metastable , one or the other is globally stable , according to whether α < α b or α > α b . The dimensionless parameter α is ultimately related through ( 13 ) to the amount of material trapped in the drop . So the coexistence interval [ α 1 , α 2 ] corresponds to a window of areas A 0 for which two diﬀerent shapes could be observed , 6 See , for example , [ 35 ] and [ 15 ] . 7 This estimate is supported for example by [ 36 ] for material such as DSCG , SSY , and PBG . 8 Discordant estimates of γ have been given in the literature [ 15 , 37 , 38 ] . Here we take the average order of magnitude found in these works ( see also Sec . IV below for an independent justiﬁcation of this choice ) . 9 Figure 6 : Bifurcation diagram for the parameter φ that describes the equilibrium proﬁle ( 15 ) as a function of the bifurcation parameter α . For every k 3 , there are three critical values of α , namely , α 1 , α b , and α 2 . Solid lines represent global minima , while broken lines represent local minima . Open circles mark the appearance or disappearance of a local minimum at α = α 1 and α = α 2 . Two green lines delimit the coexistence interval [ α 1 , α 2 ] . At α = α b , both local minima are also global minima ; two black dots mark the jump of the global minimum from one branch to the other . Here k 3 = 1 , α 1 = 172 , α b = 221 , and α 2 = 305 . The droplet’s equilibrium shape is drawn for the critical values α 1 and α 2 . more likely ( and frequently ) the one corresponding to the global minimum . If , ideally , one could gently pump material into a tactoidal drop , so as to follow the blue branch in Fig . 6 , the drop would continue to grow as a tactoid until the critical volume corresponds to α 2 , where a dynamical instability would presumably prompt the transition towards a discoid . Conversely , if material could be gently removed from the latter , it would keep its discoidal shape until the critical volume corresponds to α 1 , where it would dynamically evolve into a tactoid . The green lines in Fig . 6 delimit such a hysteresis loop .

We have computed the three critical values , α 1 , α b , and α 2 for several values of k 3 . Fig . 10 shows that , to within a good approximation , they all grow linearly with k 3 . The best linear ﬁt is provided by the following functions , α 1 ≈ 157 + 15 k 3 , ( 19a ) α b ≈ 205 + 16 k 3 , ( 19b ) α 2 ≈ 289 + 19 k 3 . ( 19c ) IV . COMPARISON WITH EXPERIMENTS A major motivation for this paper was oﬀered by the experiments conducted in [ 15 ] with water solutions of disodium cromoglycate ( DSCG ) . Here we apply our theory to interpret those experiments and show how to extract from them an estimate for the isotropic surface tension γ at the interface between the nematic phase of a DSCG sol at a given concentration and its isotropic melt . Among many other things , Kim et al . [ 15 ] explored water solution of DSCG at concentration c = 16 wt % conﬁned between two parallel glass plates at a distance ranging in the interval 1 - 5 µ m ; the plates were spin - coated with a 11 Figure 10 : Critical values of α for diﬀerent values of k 3 . To within a good approximation , they all depend linearly on k 3 . Red and blue ranges refer to discoids and tactoids , respectively , according to the same color coding adopted in Fig . 6 . The broken lines represent the best linear ﬁts in ( 19 ) . polymide layer , SE - 7511 , which exerts a degenerate tangential anchoring on the nematic director . This system can be treated as two - dimensional since the bounding plates suppress the out - of - plane distortions in the observed samples , as required by our theory . Upon quenching the system from the isotropic phase into the coexistence regime , tactoidal droplets were observed , surrounded by the parent isotropic phase . In particular ( see , Fig . 6a of [ 15 ] ) , a tactoid with bipolar nematic orientation was observed more closely , for which the area A 0 = 200 µ m 2 and the aspect ratio δ = 1 . 3 ± 1 were measured at the temperature T = 37 . 5 ◦ C , which we read oﬀ from Fig . 2c of [ 15 ] . We wish to make use of these data to validate our theory . To this end , we need to estimate the elastic constants K 11 and K 33 at T = 37 . 5 ◦ C . Interpolating the curves representing in [ 36 ] the temperature dependence of the elastic constants of the nematic phase of DSCG at c = 16 wt % , we readily arrived at K 11 = 4 pN , K 33 = 9 pN , at T = 37 . 5 ◦ C and c = 16 wt % , ( 20 ) and so we take k 3 = 2 . 25 . We can also obtain α from the measured aspect ratio δ . It follows from ( 15 ) that in our theory δ can be given the form δ : = µ R ( 0 ) = µ 2 (cid:0) 83 cos φ + π sin φ (cid:1) π ( cos φ + sin φ ) , ( 21 ) where use has also been made of ( 16 ) . The plot of δ computed on the minima of F α over S is drawn against α in Fig . 11 for k 3 . = 2 . 25 . We see that the value δ = 1 . 3 is attained by the tactoidal branch ( as expected ) for α . = 17 . 2 ; the corresponding coordinates in S of the minimum of F α are φ . = 0 and µ . = 1 . 24 , and so the equilibrium shape is a genuine tactoid ( with pointed tips ) . For k 3 = 2 . 25 , equilibrium tactoids cease to be genuine at α ≈ 137 . Since the equivalent radius R e is known from the isoperimetric constraint ( 7 ) , R e ≈ 8 µ m , we readily obtain for the long axis l of the droplet l = 2 R 0 = 2 µR e ≈ 20 µ m . The equilibrium tactoid predicted by our theory is plotted in Fig . 12 against the observed shape . Our expected value for l also agrees quite well with the measurement performed in [ 15 ] on the reconstructed shape , as does the cusp angle τ N marked in Fig . 12 . In our formalism , for a genuine tactoid , the latter can be expressed as τ N = − 2 arctan ( R ′ ( µ ) ) = 2 arctan (cid:18) 3 π 4 µ 2 (cid:19) , ( 22 ) which for µ = 1 . 24 delivers τ N . = 1 . 99 . The value of τ N reported in [ 15 ] for the shape in Fig . 12 is τ N = 1 . 05 ± 0 . 05 , whereas a direct measurement on Fig . 12 would suggest that this value is indeed τ N / 2 , in good agreement with our theoretical prediction . Moreover , by use of equation ( 13 ) , we can give the following estimate for the surface tension at the nematic / isotropic interface of an aqueous DSCG solution at 16 wt % , γ ≈ 0 . 89 × 10 − 5 J / m 2 . ( 23 ) Diﬀerent , discordant estimates have been given in the literature for the order of magnitude of γ . For example , in [ 37 ] they estimate γ ∼ 10 − 6 J / m 2 , whereas in [ 15 ] they give γ ∼ 10 − 4 J / m 2 , an estimate obtained by applying the pendant drop technique [ 39 , 40 ] . We trust that the measurements based on the theory presented in this paper might 12 Figure 11 : The droplet’s aspect ratio δ computed on the minima of F α , plotted against α for k 3 = 2 . 25 . The broken horizontal line designates the level δ = 1 . 3 , which is attained for α = 17 . 2 . Local and global minima are marked with the same symbols as in Fig . 6 . The critical values of α are α 1 = 192 , α 2 = 330 , and α b = 243 . Equilibrium tactoids are genuine for α / 137 . Figure 12 : The droplet’s equilibrium shape ( in red ) corresponding to α = 17 . 2 , φ = 0 , and µ = 1 . 24 is contrasted against the shape observed in [ 15 ] ( see their Figs . 6a and 6b ) . Our estimate for the long axis is l ≈ 20 µ m . On the left : PolScope image . On the right : reconstructed shape . be more accurate . The value in ( 23 ) is closer to that found in [ 41 ] at the nematic - isotropic interface of 5CB ( see also [ 42 , 43 ] ) . The critical values of α corresponding to k 3 = 2 . 25 are α 1 = 192 , α 2 = 330 , and α b = 243 , while the observed droplet shown in Fig . 12 corresponds to α = 17 . 2 . According to our theory , one would then expect coexistence of tactoids and discoids for R e in the range 90 µ m / R e / 153 µ m , that is , for area A 0 in the range 0 . 3 mm 2 / A 0 / 0 . 7 mm 2 , a regime of large drops , for which no data are available in [ 15 ] . V . CONCLUSION We studied chromonic droplets in two space dimensions . Our motivation was the thorough experimental investiga - tion in [ 15 ] on thin cells with degenerate tangential anchoring for the nematic director . In particular , a solution of DSCG in water was quenched in the temperature regime where nematic and isotropic phases coexist in equilibrium , the former forming islands with a tactoidal shape . We introduced a wide class of two - dimensional shapes for the equilibrium droplets , which includes tactoids , discoids , bˆatonnet , and butterﬂies , the latter of which are concave , whereas the former three are convex . Our analysis revealed that upon increasing the droplet’s area a tactoidal equilibrium branch gives way to a discoid branch , while neither bˆatonnet nor butterﬂies can ever be equilibrium shapes . Moreover , there is a regime of shape coexistence , where a tactoid and a discoid are both local minima of the free energy , the global minimum shifting from one to the other at a critical value of the droplet’s area , where perfect bistability is established . A typical bifurcation diagram with 13 hysteresis describes the situation , reminiscent of a ﬁrst - order phase transition with super - heating and super - cooling temperatures ( replaced here by corresponding values of the area ) . We put our theory to the test by interpreting experimental data provided by [ 15 ] . We found a fairly good quantitative agreement between experiment and theory , although further data should be collected to establish on ﬁrmer grounds the degree of conﬁdence of the theory . In particular , we could extract from the data available in [ 15 ] an estimate for the isotropic component γ of the surface tension at the interface between coexisting nematic and isotropic phases of DSCG in 16 % wt aqueous sol . This estimate seems to promise more accuracy than the rough evaluation of order of magnitude available in the literature for this material and its chromonic siblings . We hope that the theory proposed here could be used for a systematic determination of γ for diﬀerent temperatures and concentrations . The available data do not cover the range of predicted bistability . We estimated the area that a droplet should reach to display an abrupt transition from tactoid to discoid . It remains to be seen whether a controlled growth in the droplet’s size can be realized to observe neatly this transition . We have shown that the critical values of the area that delimit the shape hysteresis are ( increasing ) linear functions of the ratio K 33 / K 11 between bend and splay elastic constants . If this critical phenomenon could be explored experimentally , our theory would also oﬀer an independent way to measure K 33 / K 11 . This might be especially welcome for non conventional new lyotropic phases , such as chromonics . Appendix A : Retracted Tangential Field In this Appendix , we justify the expression for the free - energy functional ( 11 ) associated with the bipolar director ﬁeld n deﬁned as the unit vector ﬁeld tangent to the lines with given t and varying y ( see Fig . 2 ) . A generic curve in that family is represented by the position vector p t ( y ) : = g ( t ) R ( y ) e x + y e y , − R 0 ≦ y ≦ R 0 , ( A1 ) where g is any function of class C 1 strictly increasing on [ 0 , 1 ] and such that g ( 0 ) = 0 and g ( 1 ) = 1 . For given t ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] , the tangent vector ﬁeld n is given by n = gR ′ e x + e y p 1 + ( gR ′ ) 2 , ( A2 ) where a prime denotes diﬀerentiation . The unit vector ﬁeld n ⊥ : = e z × n = − e x + gR ′ e y p 1 + ( gR ′ ) 2 ( A3 ) is everywhere orthogonal to n and such that n ⊥ | ∂ R = − ν , where ν is the outer unit normal to ∂ R ( see again Fig . 2 ) . Imagine now a smooth curve in R parameterized as ξ 7→ ( t ( ξ ) , y ( ξ ) ) ; it follows from ( A1 ) and ( A2 ) that ˙ p = g ′ R ˙ t e x + ˙ y ( gR ′ e x + e y ) = g ′ R ˙ t e x + p 1 + ( gR ′ ) 2 ˙ y n , ( A4 ) where a superimposed dot denotes speciﬁcally diﬀerentiation with respect to ξ . Thus , the elementary area d A is d A = d t d yg ′ R p 1 + ( gR ′ ) 2 e x × n · e z = g ′ R d t d y , ( A5 ) and the elementary length d ℓ t on the retracted curve ∂ R t , for given t , is d ℓ t = p 1 + ( gR ′ ) 2 d y . ( A6 ) In particular , the area of R and the length of its boundary are given by A ( R ) = 2 Z 1 0 g ′ d t Z R 0 − R 0 R d y = 2 Z R 0 − R 0 R d y ( A7 ) and ℓ ( ∂ R ) = 2 Z R 0 − R 0 p 1 + R ′ 2 d y . ( A8 ) 14 Diﬀerentiating n in ( A2 ) along the smooth curve ξ 7→ ( t ( ξ ) , y ( ξ ) ) , we ﬁnd that ˙ n = − g ′ R ′ ˙ t + gR ′′ ˙ y 1 + ( gR ′ ) 2 n ⊥ . ( A9 ) Assuming that n is diﬀerentiable in R , ˙ n and ˙ p must be related through ˙ n = ( ∇ n ) ˙ p . ( A10 ) Since n is a unit vector ﬁeld , ( ∇ n ) T annihilates n , and so there exists a vector a = a 1 n + a 2 n ⊥ such that ∇ n = n ⊥ ⊗ a . ( A11 ) To determine the scalar components a i of a , we observe that , by ( A11 ) , ( A10 ) also reads as ˙ n = ( a · ˙ p ) n ⊥ . ( A12 ) Making use of ( A4 ) and both ( A2 ) and ( A3 ) , we readily see that a · ˙ p = g ′ R ( gR ′ a 1 + a 2 ) ˙ t p 1 + ( gR ′ ) 2 + p 1 + ( gR ′ ) 2 a 1 ˙ y , ( A13 ) and inserting this into ( A12 ) alongside with ( A9 ) , we obtain an identity for arbitrary ( ˙ t , ˙ y ) only if a 1 = − gR ′′ [ 1 + ( gR ′ ) 2 ] 3 / 2 , a 2 = R ′ R 1 p 1 + ( gR ′ ) 2 − g 2 R ′ R ′′ [ 1 + ( gR ′ ) 2 ] 3 / 2 , ( A14 ) which leads us to ∇ n = − gR ′′ [ 1 + ( gR ′ ) 2 ] 3 / 2 n ⊥ ⊗ n + R ′ R 1 p 1 + ( gR ′ ) 2 − g 2 R ′ R ′′ [ 1 + ( gR ′ ) 2 ] 3 / 2 ! n ⊥ ⊗ n ⊥ . ( A15 ) The following expressions for the traditional measures of distortion then follow from ( A15 ) , div n = R ′ p 1 + ( gR ′ ) 2 (cid:18) 1 R − g 2 R ′′ 1 + ( gR ′ ) 2 (cid:19) , ( A16a ) curl n = − gR ′′ [ 1 + ( gR ′ ) 2 ] 3 / 2 e z , ( A16b ) n · curl n = 0 , ( A16c ) n × curl n = gR ′′ [ 1 + ( gR ′ ) 2 ] 3 / 2 n ⊥ , ( A16d ) tr ( ∇ n ) 2 − ( div n ) 2 = 0 . ( A16e ) We found it useful to rescale all lengths to the radius R e of the disc of area A 0 . Letting µ as in ( 9 ) and using ( 6 ) and ( A7 ) , we arrive at the following reduced functional , F [ µ ; R ] : = F [ B ] K 11 h = = Z µ − µ d y Z 1 0 g ′ " g 4 RR ′ 2 R ′′ 2 (cid:0) 1 + ( gR ′ ) 2 (cid:1) 3 + R ′ 2 R 1 (cid:0) 1 + ( gR ′ ) 2 (cid:1) − 2 g 2 R ′ 2 R ′′ (cid:0) 1 + ( gR ′ ) 2 (cid:1) 2 + k 3 g 2 RR ′′ 2 (cid:0) 1 + ( gR ′ ) 2 (cid:1) 3 # d t + 2 α Z µ − µ p 1 + R ′ 2 d y , ( A17 ) where k 3 and α are as in ( 12 ) and in ( 13 ) . The integration in t , which delivers ( 11 ) in the main text , is independent of the speciﬁc function g , provided it is monotonic and obeys the prescribed boundary conditions . 15 Appendix B : Preventing Anchoring Breaking Here , we perform an energy comparison to identify the safeguard value α s of α , that is , the lower bound that should be exceeded for a drop to be bipolar at equilibrium . It is known that for α suﬃciently small the tangential anchoring favored by the interfacial energy ( 4 ) is bound to be broken , so that the nematic alignment becomes uniform throughout the droplet . Uniform and bipolar alignments will indeed be the terms of comparison for our estimate of α s . For drops with uniform alignment , the total free energy reduces to ( 4 ) , subject to the area constraint ( 10 ) . The optimal shape is delivered by the classical Wulﬀ’s construnction [ 44 ] ( see also [ 18 , p . 490 ] ) . Assuming that n ≡ e y and that R is mirror - symmetric with respect to both axes e x and e y , one needs only determine the equilibrium shape of R in the positive ( x , y ) quadrant . We let y = y W ( x ) ≧ 0 represent the proﬁle of R and deﬁne λ > 0 by setting y W ( λ ) = 0 . Here , as in the main text , all lengths are scaled to R e . The method illustrated in [ 19 , Ch . 5 ] and [ 45 ] delivers Wulﬀ’s shape through the following explicit function y W (cid:0) xλ − 1 (cid:1) λ − 1 = 1 + ω (cid:0) 1 − ξ 2 (cid:1) − ξxλ − 1 p 1 − ξ 2 . ( B1a ) where ξ is given in terms of x by solving the algebraic equation ωξ 3 + ( 1 − ω ) ξ − xλ − 1 = 0 ( B1b ) and λ is determined by the isoperimetric constraint ( 10 ) , which here reads as 4 Z λ 0 y W ( x ) d x = 4 λ 2 Z 1 0 y W (cid:0) xλ − 1 (cid:1) λ − 1 d (cid:0) xλ − 1 (cid:1) = π . ( B1c ) Correspondingly , by computing the free energy in ( 4 ) on Wulﬀ’s shape , we obtain that F W = 4 K 11 hαj ( ω ) , ( B2 ) where the function j , deﬁned by j ( ω ) : = 1 2 s π R 1 0 y W d x Z 1 0 q 1 + y ′ 2W d x + ω Z 1 0 1 p 1 + y ′ 2W d x ! , ( B3 ) is computed on the solution y W of ( B1 ) , renormalized so that y W ( 1 ) = 0 . Figure 13 illustrates the Wulﬃan shape obtained with this method for ω = 5 and the graph of j for 0 ≦ ω ≦ 10 . We now compare this energy to that of a disc with an in - plane bipolar director ﬁeld whose integral lines are Apol - lonian circles passing through the poles ( see , for example , § 2 of [ 46 ] ) ; their radius increases to + ∞ upon approaching the y - axis , as shown in Fig . 14 , which represents a quadrant of the disc . Adapting the computations in bipolar coordinates ( ξ , η ) of Williams [ 47 ] to the present two - dimensional setting , we arrive at F bip : = K 11 h ( 4 Z π 2 ε d ξ Z π 2 0 d η (cid:20) 1 2 cos 2 ξ sin ξ 1 ( 1 + sin ξ cos η ) 2 + k 3 2 sin 2 η sin ξ ( 1 + sin ξ cos η ) 2 (cid:21) + 2 απ ) = 4 hK 11 nh π 4 ( k 3 − 1 − k 3 ln 2 − ln ε ) + ε + α (cid:16) π 2 − ε (cid:17)i + αωπε 2 o , ( B4 ) where the detect core has been identiﬁed with the region 0 ≦ ξ ≦ ε . The estimate in ( 18 ) follows from requiring that F bip < F W . [ 1 ] T . Ogolla and P . J .
