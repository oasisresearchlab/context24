Lipscomb , Harvard University , Cambridge , MA , and approved February 27 , 2003 ( received for review April 12 , 2002 ) The structures of Saccharomyces cerevisiae , Dictyostelium , and Caenorhabditis elegans actin bound to gelsolin segment - 1 have been solved and reﬁned at resolutions between 1 . 9 and 1 . 75 Å . These structures reveal several features relevant to the ATP hy - drolytic mechanism , including identiﬁcation of the nucleophilic water and the roles of Gln - 137 and His - 161 in positioning and activating the catalytic water , respectively . The involvement of these residues in the catalytic mechanism is consistent with yeast genetics studies . This work highlights both structural and mecha - nistic similarities with the small and trimeric G proteins and restricts the types of mechanisms responsible for the considerable enhancement of ATP hydrolysis associated with actin polymeriza - tion . The conservation of functionalities involved in nucleotide binding and catalysis also provide insights into the mechanistic features of members of the family of actin - related proteins . A ctin is a ubiquitous 43 - kDa adenine nucleotide - binding protein involved in a wide range of fundamental processes in eukaryotic cells , including cell motility ( 1 ) , cytokinesis ( 2 ) , vesicle transport ( 3 , 4 ) , and the establishment and maintenance of cell morphology ( 5 , 6 ) . Actin is also an essential component of numerous specialized structures in higher eukaryotes , such as the intestinal brush border ( 7 , 8 ) and stereocilia ( 9 , 10 ) . The ability of actin to participate in these diverse processes is a consequence of the dynamic and polymorphic nature of the filamentous actin ( F - actin ) assemblies that are formed in vivo . Central to understanding cytoskeletal regulation is the con - tribution of the adenine nucleotide to actin structure , function , and dynamics . Bound nucleotide is required to stabilize the actin monomer under physiological conditions , because nucleotide - free actin denatures at a rate of 0 . 2 s (cid:1) 1 ( 11 ) . ATP hydrolysis occurs subsequent to monomer addition to the growing filament , thus ‘‘marking’’ the oldest part of the filament ( i . e . , ADP - actin ) , and may serve as a timing mechanism for filament disassembly , analogous to the role of GTP hydrolysis in G proteins ( 12 , 13 ) . Furthermore , several regulatory proteins ( e . g . , profilin , cofilin , and thymosin (cid:1) - 4 ) show specificity for either ATP - or ADP - actin , which is thought to be an important element of cytoskel - etal regulation ( 12 ) . Actin dynamics also depends on the identity of the bound metal – nucleotide complex ( 14 – 21 ) . The structure of the actin monomer has been known for over a decade , and the structures of mammalian Ca 2 (cid:2) - ATP actins in complex with DNase I ( 22 ) , profilin ( 23 ) , gelsolin segment - 1 ( 24 ) , and gelsolin segments - 4 – 6 ( 25 ) are available . An orthor - hombic crystal form of the Ca 2 (cid:2) - ATP Dictyostelium actin (cid:2) gelsolin segment - 1 structure has also been reported ( 26 ) . These structures highlighted specific regulatory interactions and re - vealed the remarkable architectural similarity between actin and a wide range of proteins ( 27 ) , including the heat shock cognate ATPases ( e . g . , HSC70 ) and sugar kinases ( e . g . , hexokinase ) ( 28 – 30 ) . This structural homology likely reflects functional and mechanistic similarities , because these proteins couple changes in nucleotide state to conformation rearrangements required for activity . Because these structures did not contain the physiolog - ically relevant Mg 2 (cid:2) - ATP metal nucleotide , a number of essen - tial issues related to actin’s ATPase activity remain to be addressed . We report the monoclinic crystal structures of Sac - charomyces cerevisiae , Dictyostelium , and Caenorhabditis elegans actin in complex with gelsolin segment - 1 at resolutions that range from 1 . 9 to 1 . 75 Å . The metal nucleotide complexes represented in these structures include Ca 2 (cid:2) - , Li (cid:2) - , and the physiologically relevant Mg 2 (cid:2) - ATP species . The relatively high resolution of these structures highlights mechanistic similarities to the small and trimeric G proteins , allows for the identification of the nucleophilic water and catalytic base , and suggests a structural explanation for the reduced ability of calcium to support nucleotide hydrolysis . These structures , in conjunction with the Holmes model of the actin filament ( 31 ) , also limit the types of mechanisms that may be responsible for the greater than three orders of magnitude enhancement in hydrolytic activity associated with the monomer to filament transition ( 32 ) . Fur - thermore , the present work is directly relevant to a mechanistic understanding of members of the family of actin - related proteins that share considerable sequence and structural similarity with actin ( 33 , 34 ) . Methods Preparation and Crystallization of Nonvertebrate Actin – Gelsolin Com - plexes . Standard methods were used for the preparation of S . cerevisiae , Dictyostelium discoiteum ( 35 ) , and C . elegans ( 36 ) actin . Human gelsolin segment - 1 was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 ( DE3 ) and purified from inclusion bodies as described ( 37 ) with minor modifications . The yeast Mg 2 (cid:2) - ATP actin - gelsolin segment - 1 complex was prepared by mixing yeast actin with gelsolin ( 1 : 1 . 25 stoichiom - etry ) in 2 mM Tris (cid:1) HCl (cid:2) 2 mM ATP (cid:2) 4 mM MgCl 2 (cid:2) 0 . 5 mM EGTA (cid:2) 1 mM NaN 3 , pH 8 . 0 . Crystals were grown by hanging drop vapor diffusion using precipitant composed of 1 . 4 – 1 . 7 M ammonium sulfate in 100 mM Hepes ( pH 7 . 5 ) , containing 2 mM Mg - ATP . Diffraction from these crystals is consistent with the monoclinic space group C 2 ( a (cid:3) 176 . 66 Å , b (cid:3) 68 . 09 Å , b (cid:3) 54 . 59 Å , (cid:1) (cid:3) 102 . 55° ) , with a single actin - segment - 1 complex per asymmetric unit . The Dictyostelium Mg 2 (cid:2) - ATP actin complex was crystallized from 1 . 5 M Li 2 SO 4 (cid:2) 2 mM Mg 2 (cid:2) - ATP (cid:2) 0 . 5 mM EGTA (cid:2) 0 . 1 M Hepes , pH 7 . 5 . Replacement of Mg 2 (cid:2) with Ca 2 (cid:2) was accomplished by soaking the Mg 2 (cid:2) - ATP crystals in 1 . 6 M Li 2 SO 4 (cid:2) 10 mM CaCl 2 (cid:2) 2 mM Na (cid:2) - ATP (cid:2) 0 . 1 M Hepes , pH 7 . 5 for 4 months . Crystals of the Li (cid:2) - ATP Dictyostelium actin complex were grown from 1 . 7 M Li 2 SO 4 (cid:2) 2 mM Mg 2 (cid:2) - ATP (cid:2) 0 . 5 mM EGTA (cid:2) 0 . 1 M Tris , pH 7 . 9 . Crystals of the C . elegans Mg 2 (cid:2) - ATP actin complex were grown from 1 . 55 M Li 2 SO 4 (cid:2) 2 mM Mg 2 (cid:2) - ATP (cid:2) 0 . 5 mM EGTA (cid:2) 0 . 1 M Hepes , pH 7 . 5 .

Data were collected at (cid:1) 180°C on beam line X9B at the National Synchrotron Light Source , Brookhaven National Laboratory , at a wavelength of 0 . 98 Å by using a MAR345 image plate detector . Before flash freezing , the crystals were serially transferred to mother liquor containing between 10 % and 20 % ( vol (cid:2) vol ) glycerol . Data were processed with the program DENZO and scaled and merged with SCALEPACK ( 38 ) . The structure of the yeast Mg 2 (cid:2) - ATP actin complex was solved by molecular replacement with AMORE ( 39 ) using the rabbit skeletal muscle actin (cid:2) gelsolin segment - 1 complex as the search model ( coordinates kindly provided by P . McLaughlin , University of Edinburgh , Edinburgh ) . Refinement with program X - PLOR ( 40 ) and manual rebuilding , using 2 F o (cid:1) F c and F o (cid:1) F c , difference Fourier syntheses , resulted in a final R factor of 19 . 3 % ( R free is 23 . 1 % ) at 1 . 9 - Å resolution ( Table 1 , which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site , www . pnas . org ) . Solvent molecules were built into 3 . 5 - (cid:2) peaks in difference Fourier syntheses , and Mg 2 (cid:2) , Ca 2 (cid:2) , and SO 4 2 (cid:1) ions were subse - quently assigned on the basis of observed electron density , coordination number and geometry , and refined B factors . The final model consists of 3 , 882 protein atoms ( 2 , 890 from actin , 992 from gelsolin segment - 1 ) , a single ATP , one Mg 2 (cid:2) , one Ca 2 (cid:2) , one SO 42 (cid:1) , and 427 water molecules ( Fig . 1 ) . The Ramachandran plot , computed with the program PROCHECK ( 41 ) , showed that 93 . 7 % of the residues reside in the most favorable region of conformational space , whereas 6 . 3 % lie in additional allowed regions . The first four residues of yeast actin were not observed in electron density maps and were not included in the final model . Residues 40 – 41 in the DNase I loop were modeled as alanine because of weak electron density . The structures of the Dictyostelium and C . elegans complexes were solved by difference Fourier methods and refined as described above , with R free values that ranged from 23 . 2 % to 25 . 8 % ( Table 1 ) . Genetics . To attempt to make the H161A actin , the appropriately mutated actin sequence was placed on the centromeric plasmid pRS314 ( 42 ) marked with the TRP1 gene . This plasmid was used to transform a trp1 , ura3 - 52 S . cerevisiae haploid strain in which the chromosomal ACT1 gene had been disrupted by replacement of the coding sequence with the LEU2 gene ; wild - type actin was expressed in these recipient cells from another centromeric plasmid containing the URA3 gene . After transformation with the mutant plasmid and selection on tryptophan - deficient me - dium , surviving cells were obtained in quantities comparable to that achieved in a wild - type control . We attempted to eliminate the wild - type actin plasmid by growing the cells repeatedly in trp (cid:1) (cid:2) ura (cid:2) medium , and after replica plating colonies from 60 surviving cells on trp (cid:1) (cid:2) ura (cid:1) medium , only three ura (cid:1) colonies were identified . Plasmid rescue and DNA sequencing for each of these colonies revealed the plasmid contained a wild - type actin sequence . For a mutant actin that has little or no impact on cell viability , this procedure gives us 50 – 55 ura (cid:1) (cid:2) trp (cid:1) colonies , all of which will contain the mutant sequence . Similar results were obtained when the cells were selected on 5 - fluoroacetic acid plates to force the elimination of the URA3 plasmid . To attempt to generate the Q137 E mutant , we used the procedure of Cook et al . ( 43 ) to construct a URA3 - marked centromeric plasmid , pCENQ137E . The plasmid was introduced into a homozygous ura3 – 52 , leu2 diploid strain of yeast in which one of the two chromosomal actin genes had been disrupted by the LEU2 gene . Transformed diploids able to grow on ura (cid:1) (cid:2) leu (cid:1) medium were readily obtained . After sporulation of these cells , tetrad dissection was performed in an attempt to identify leu (cid:1) (cid:2) ura (cid:2) colonies . Repeated dissections produced no such surviving haploid cells . Results and Discussion Nonvertebrate Actin Structures . Like the mammalian actins , non - vertebrate actins are composed of two major domains that form a deep cleft representing the metal – nucleotide binding site ( Fig . 1 ) . These two domains can be further divided into smaller subdomains ; the first consists of subdomain 1 ( residues 1 – 32 , 70 – 144 , and 338 – 375 ) and subdomain 2 ( residues 33 – 69 ) , and the second domain is composed of subdomain 3 ( residues 145 – 180 and 270 – 337 ) and subdomain 4 ( residues 181 – 269 ) . Consistent with the high level of sequence conservation ( (cid:4) 85 % ) , the overall structural similarity of the vertebrate and nonverte - brate actins is highlighted by the small deviations between these independent structures . The most variable region of the actin molecule appears to be the DNase I loop ( residues 35 – 53 in subdomain 2 ) , as this segment is disordered in several of the structures and is present in a different conformation in each of the structures where there is observable electron density ( for example ; ref . 44 ) . As demonstrated by the recent ADP - actin structure ( 45 ) , the plasticity of the DNase I loop likely reflects the potential of this segment to alter conformation in response to nucleotide state and polymerization . The five nonvertebrate actin structures described here exhibit rms deviations that range from 0 . 47 to 0 . 77 Å ( excluding the DNase I loop ) , and these deviations extend to 1 . 3 Å when mammalian (cid:3) - and (cid:1) - actins are considered . In the nonvertebrate actin (cid:2) gelsolin segment - 1 crystal struc - Fig . 1 . Overall structure of the yeast actin / gelsolin segment - 1 complex . Gelsolin ( purple ) binds to subdomains 1 and 3 of actin ( yellow ) . Sixteen water molecules ( aqua ) contribute to the actin - gelsolin binding interface . Eight water molecules ( red ) form a network across the actin nucleotide binding cleft , contacting residues in subdomains 1 , 3 , and 4 ( red backbone ) . The gelsolin - associated Ca 2 (cid:2) ion is represented as pink . The adenine nucleotide is also shown , with the Mg 2 (cid:2) ion in black . Vorobiev et al . PNAS (cid:3) May 13 , 2003 (cid:3) vol . 100 (cid:3) no . 10 (cid:3) 5761 B I O P H Y S I C S tures , electron density maps ( calculated with either 2 F o (cid:1) F c or F o (cid:1) F c coefficients ) clearly identified a sulfate ion located on a crystallographic 2 - fold axis . This sulfate makes hydrogen bonds with the backbone amide nitrogens of residues 62 , 203 , and 204 from subdomains 2 and 4 of two symmetry related actin mole - cules and likely contributes to the formation and maintenance of the crystal lattice . Two water molecules complete the coordina - tion sphere , resulting in a total of eight hydrogen bonds with a geometry frequently observed for anion - binding sites in proteins ( 46 ) . A number of additional bound water molecules are also observed in the present structures . Of particular note is a network of eight water molecules that runs across the nucleotide - binding cleft . This network is stabilized by interactions with Gly - 15 , Asp - 157 , Arg - 210 , Glu - 214 , Lys - 336 , and Tyr - 337 , con - necting subdomains 1 , 3 , and 4 , and may thus contribute to the overall dynamic and function of the actin monomer ( Fig . 2 ) . This network is partially conserved in all of the nonvertebrate actin structures , and appears to be fully conserved in the mammalian ADP - actin structure . Nucleotide – Metal Binding Site . ATP binds at the bottom of the cleft formed by the two major lobes of the actin molecule and contacts all four subdomains , thus providing a mechanism for nucleotide dependent conformational changes . The ATP moiety in the yeast actin structure displays 2 (cid:5) - endo sugar pucker , the glycosidic torsion angle ( (cid:4) glyc (cid:3) O4 (cid:5) - C1 (cid:5) - N9 - C4 ) adopts the anticonformation ( (cid:4) glyc (cid:3) (cid:1) 113° ) , and the polyphosphate tail assumes a relatively extended conformation . As a member of the nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase superfamily , actin is charac - terized by the so - called P loops , P1 , P2 , and P3 , that are responsible for recognizing the polyphosphate tail , the divalent ( monovalent ) cation , and the purine base , respectively ( 47 ) ( Fig . 4 , which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site ) . In the nonvertebrate actins , these loops correspond to residues 11 – 22 , 150 – 159 , and 295 – 306 , contributed from subdo - mains 1 , 3 , and 4 , respectively ( Table 2 , which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site ) . Based on the coordination number and geometry , the ATP - bound cation in the present yeast actin structure can be confi - dently identified as a Mg 2 (cid:2) ion . The ion exhibits nearly ideal octahedral coordination ( 48 ) , making a bidentate interaction with nonbridging (cid:1) - and (cid:5) - phosphoryl oxygens of ATP , with the remainder of the coordination shell being completed by four water molecules ( Fig . 3 , and Figs . 4 and 5 , which are published as supporting information on the PNAS web site ) . The four coordinating water molecules make hydrogen bonds with car - boxylate side chain functionalities of Asp - 11 ( P1 loop ) and Asp - 154 ( P2 loop ) , and with the side chain of Gln - 137 . The Mg 2 (cid:2) ion does not make direct contacts with actin , with the nearest protein atom being the side chain oxygen of Gln - 137 ( 4 . 16 Å ) . In addition to the interaction with bound metal , the polypho - sphate tail makes numerous contacts with elements of the P1 loop . The nonbridging (cid:5) - phosphoryl oxygens interact with the backbone amide nitrogen and the side chain hydroxyl of Ser - 14 , as well as with the backbone amide nitrogen of Asp - 157 con - tributed from the P2 loop . The (cid:1) , (cid:5) - bridging oxygen also forms a potential hydrogen bond with the backbone amide of Asp - 157 . One of the nonbridging (cid:1) - phosphoryl oxygens hydrogen bonds to the backbone amides of Gly - 15 and Met - 16 , whereas one of the (cid:3) - phosphoryl oxygens interacts with the backbone amide of Gly - 302 from the P3 loop . Lys - 18 is the sole basic functionality interacting with the nucleotide , forming a bidentate interaction with nonbridging (cid:3) - and (cid:1) - phosphoryl oxygens . Of particular interest is a water molecule ( WAT709 ) that ranges from 3 . 90 to 4 . 15 Å from the (cid:5) - phosphoryl depending on the identity of the nucleotide - bound metal ( Fig . 3 and supporting information ) . The role of this water as the putative nucleophile in the hydrolytic mechanism is described below . In the nonvertebrate Mg 2 (cid:2) - ATP actins , the adenosine ring occupies a hydrophobic pocket formed by the side chains of Met - 305 and Phe - 306 from the P3 loop , as well as the methylene carbons of the side chains from Lys - 213 and Glu - 214 . The endocyclic and exocyclic nitrogens of the purine ring form water - mediated hydrogen bonds with NZ of Lys - 213 and Lys - 336 , and with the main chain carbonyls of residues 213 , 214 , and 305 . The exocyclic ribose oxygens also participate in specific polar contacts , with O2 (cid:5) interacting with the side chain func - tionalities of Lys - 213 and Glu - 214 , and O3 (cid:5) interacting with the side chains of Asp - 157 and Lys - 213 . The interactions involved in binding adenine nucleotide are conserved in the Dictyostelium and C . elegans actins . The substitution of Li (cid:2) - ATP for Mg 2 (cid:2) - ATP in Dictyostelium actin appears to cause only minor alterations , as the metal maintains hexacoordination with the same ligands and only very modest alterations in bond lengths . The Ca 2 (cid:2) - ATP Dictyostelium actin structure shows heptacoordination around the calcium , with distances that are systematically longer than the Mg 2 (cid:2) - ATP structure , as expected . The equivalent of WAT709 also exhibits a slight change in position relative to the (cid:5) - phosphoryl . The Mechanism of ATP Hydrolysis in the Actin Monomer . The present structures , in particular the isomorphous series of metal - ATP Dictyostelium actin structures , provide a framework for exam - ining the kinetic and mechanistic features of the actin catalyzed ATP hydrolytic reaction ( Fig . 3 ) . In all of the nonvertebrate structures , the equivalent of WAT709 appears to be positioned through its interaction with Gln - 137 to act as the nucleophile for direct in - line attack at the (cid:5) - phosphoryl of ATP . In the Dictyo - stelium Mg 2 (cid:2) - ATP structure , WAT709 is positioned 4 . 01 Å from the (cid:5) - phosphoryl of ATP and the (cid:1) - (cid:5) bridging oxygen - P (cid:5) - WAT709 angle is 167° . A comparable organization is present in all of the nonvertebrate actin structures , and of particular note , the same relative geometry of the P (cid:5) , water nucleophile , and the Fig . 2 . Detailsofthewater - mediatedhydrogenbondingnetworkacrossthe nucleotide - binding cleft . Eight solvent molecules ( black ) run across the nu - cleotide binding cleft and may play a role in transducing changes in the nucleotide state into structural and dynamic changes relevant to polymeriza - tion and interactions with regulatory proteins . 5762 (cid:3) www . pnas . org (cid:2) cgi (cid:2) doi (cid:2) 10 . 1073 (cid:2) pnas . 0832273100 Vorobiev et al . equivalent of Gln - 137 ( Gln - 61 in ras and Gln - 204 in the G i (cid:3) 1 structure ) is present in the trimeric ( 49 , 50 ) and small ( 51 ) G proteins , supporting the assignment of WAT709 as the catalytic water . In the nonvertebrate Mg 2 (cid:2) - ATP actin structures the ND of His - 161 participates in a water - mediated hydrogen bond with WAT709 , suggesting that His - 161 may activate WAT709 by functioning as a general base catalyst . The assignment of His - 161 as the catalytic base is supported not only by its proximity to the putative water nucleophile and (cid:5) - phosphoryl , but also the lack of additional , appropriately positioned functional groups in the nucleotide - binding cavity . Three closest appropriate side chains , Asp - 11 , Asp - 154 , and His - 73 , are at least 5 , 7 , and 8 Å distant from the putative water nucleophile , respectively , with the two carboxylates participating in water - mediated interactions with the nucleotide - associated metal . Mutagenesis experiments in - volving these residues , as well as others in the vicinity of the active site , have identified a number of functionalities critical for catalytic activity and viability ( reviewed in ref . 52 ) . However , in the case of the aspartic acidic residues , the observed activities and phenotypes are likely the consequence of improper metal coordination , as there exists no evidence supporting their repo - sitioning to allow for direct activation of the nucleophile , either in actin or any other member of the superfamily . The negative charge that accumulates in the transition state is stabilized by the divalent cation that coordinates the (cid:1) - and (cid:5) - phosphates , a series of hydrogen bonds involving main chain and side chain polar groups and a single ionic interaction involving Lys - 18 . In the Dictyostelium Ca 2 (cid:2) - ATP structure the distance between WAT709 and the (cid:5) - phosphoryl increases to 4 . 15 Å , whereas the (cid:1) - (cid:5) bridging oxygen - P (cid:5) - WAT709 angle decreases to 157° . This increase in distance and excursion from linearity suggests a partial explanation for the reduced ability of Ca 2 (cid:2) to support ATP hydrolysis , as even very small changes in relative geometry can have significant effects on reactivity . Of note , the water - mediated hydrogen bond between WAT709 and the (cid:6) nitrogen of His - 161 is preserved in the Ca 2 (cid:2) - ATP structure . Of particular mechanistic interest is the Li (cid:2) - ATP Dictyoste - lium actin structure , which exhibits the opposite trend observed in the Ca 2 (cid:2) - ATP structure . In the Li (cid:2) - ATP structure , the separation between WAT709 and the (cid:5) - phosphoryl decreases to 3 . 90 Å and the (cid:1) - (cid:5) bridging oxygen - P (cid:5) - WAT709 angle ap - proaches linearity at 174° . Furthermore , in the model of the Li (cid:2) - ATP structure , His - 161 displays an altered side chain con - formation ( (cid:4) 1 (cid:3) (cid:1) 56° , (cid:4) 2 (cid:3) (cid:1) 77° ) compared with the Mg 2 (cid:2) - ATP ( (cid:4) 1 (cid:3) (cid:1) 82° , (cid:4) 2 (cid:3) 117° ) structure . Notably , in this confor - mation the NE of His - 161 participates in a direct hydrogen bond with WAT709 ( 3 . 30 Å ) ( Fig . 3 ) . Although His - 161 reproducibly refines to this position , careful examination of the electron density suggests that there may be partial occupancy of the bridging water molecule , which would necessitate partial occu - pancy of a side chain rotamer similar to that observed in the Mg 2 (cid:2) - ATP structure . These observations highlight the mobile properties of His - 161 , which might be expected of a residue Fig . 3 . Proposed mechanism for ATP hydrolysis .

Although speculative , these structures may provide a model of the actin - associated ATPase reaction coordinate prior to reaching the transition state . Vorobiev et al . PNAS (cid:3) May 13 , 2003 (cid:3) vol . 100 (cid:3) no . 10 (cid:3) 5763 B I O P H Y S I C S involved in catalysis . Thus , the isomorphous series of Dictyoste - lium metal – ATP structures exhibits a continuum of WAT709 positions that range from the least likely to support phosphoryl transfer in the Ca 2 (cid:2) - ATP structure ( i . e . , greatest distance from (cid:5) - phosphoryl and least in line ) to the most favorable in the Li (cid:2) - ATP structure ( i . e . , shortest distance from (cid:5) - phosphoryl and the most linear approach ) . The unambiguous identification of ATP in the active site is noteworthy , as it suggests that turnover in the crystalline state is significantly reduced relative to solution , likely as a consequence of crystal contacts ( and (cid:2) or binding of gelsolin S1 ) that hinder local (cid:2) global conformational alterations required for hydrolysis ( see below ) . The current structural analysis strongly implicates Gln - 137 and His - 161 as primary participants in the actin - associated ATPase reaction . These assignments are supported by genetic studies suggesting that the presence of Gln and His at residues 137 and 161 , respectively , is required for viability in yeast . Numerous attempts were made to alter Gln - 137 to a glutamic acid , a substitution that occurs naturally in other members of the actin superfamily , as well as to mutate His - 161 to alanine . These studies involved two basic approaches . The first was the intro - duction of the mutant carried on a centromeric plasmid into a diploid strain of yeast that already harbored a single disrupted chromosomal actin gene , followed by tetrad dissection to isolate viable cells producing only the mutant actin ( 53 ) . The second approach involved a plasmid shuffling protocol using haploid cells carrying a wild - type actin coding sequence on a URA3 - marked plasmid . After introduction of the plasmid containing the mutant actin coding sequence , elimination of the WT plasmid was attempted both in the absence and in the presence of 5 - fluoroorotic acid , which provides a more stringent selection ( 54 ) . In no case were viable cells obtained that expressed only the mutant actins . In all cases parallel controls with mutant con - structs at other positions that were known to produce viable cells were successful . The metal - dependent structural changes observed in the actin monomer are consistent with a recent reevaluation of the role of bound divalent cation . Blanchoin and Pollard ( 55 ) used quenched - flow methods to demonstrate that the rate of ATP hydrolysis by Mg 2 (cid:2) - F - actin ( 0 . 30 s (cid:1) 1 ) is 6 - fold higher than that of Ca 2 (cid:2) - F - actin ( 0 . 05 s (cid:1) 1 ) ( limitations in instrumental deadtime precluded the examination of shorter reaction times that may have distinguished Li (cid:2) - and Mg 2 (cid:2) - ATP ) . Although absolute magnitudes are difficult to predict , these kinetic results support our proposal that magnesium promotes an arrangement in which the putative water nucleophile is positioned closer to the ideal ‘‘in - line’’ geometry . It is important to note that although the placement of water molecules can be subjective , especially at the resolution of these studies , the systematic trend observed for WAT709 is consistent with the available kinetic data and suggests that these structures may represent movements along the reaction coordinate before achieving the transition state ( Fig . 3 ) . Comparison with Other NTPases . Monomeric actin exhibits an extremely slow hydrolytic activity toward ATP ( apparent first order rate constant of 10 (cid:1) 5 s (cid:1) 1 ) ( 32 ) , which is consistent with the relative sparseness of functional groups that interact with the polyphosphate tail ( Fig . 3 and supporting information ) . A par - ticularly meaningful manner in which to view these hydrolytic rates is to examine the catalytic power , which is defined as the ratio of the maximal turnover number for the enzyme catalyzed reaction ( i . e . , k cat ) compared with the pseudofirst order rate constant for the same reaction under the same solvent conditions ( k soln ) ( 56 ) . Thus , although the hydrolytic rate for G - actin is slow , it is still well over three orders of magnitude faster than the solvent catalyzed reaction , the equivalent of a catalytic power of (cid:6) 10 3 . 6 ( 32 , 56 ) . For comparison , the catalytic power of typical ATPases , such as the mitochondrial F1 ATPase and myosin are (cid:6) 10 10 . 7 ( 56 ) . These large differences in catalytic power can be attributed to specific protein functionalities that contribute to transition state stabilization and activation of the water nucleo - phile . In the F1 ATPase , two arginines and one lysine interact with the nonbridging oxygens of the (cid:5) - phosphoryl of ATP , whereas in the nonvertebrate Mg 2 (cid:2) - ATP actin structures , the sole protein derived basic functionality in the vicinity of the polyphosphate tail is Lys - 18 . Monomeric actin is more similar to the small G proteins ( i . e . , ras ) and trimeric G proteins ( i . e . , G i (cid:3) 1 ) , which display relatively low catalytic powers of 10 5 . 7 and 10 7 . 1 , respectively ( 56 ) . The G proteins , like actin , have a reduced number of basic functionalities interacting with the polyphos - phate tail as compared with the F1 ATPase , and are thus less effective at stabilizing the transition state . The G proteins also appear to lack a general base , consistent with the lowered hydrolytic rates that are observed . Although the equivalent of Gln - 137 in actin has been proposed to serve as a general base in the G protein catalyzed reactions ( 51 , 57 ) , the pK a of the carboxamide side chain argues against such a role , and this residue is likely to effect catalysis through positioning the water nucleophile , as well as providing some degree of stabilization to the developing charge as the transition state is approached ( 58 , 59 ) . It is anticipated that Gln - 137 may play a similar role in actin catalyzed ATP hydrolysis . Implications for the F - actin ATPase Activity . Although our current structural analysis is based solely on the actin monomer , this model may provide some insights into the mechanistic features required for the greatly enhanced rate of ATP hydrolysis asso - ciated with actin polymerization . In the case of the small G proteins , the rates of GTP hydrolysis are enhanced several orders of magnitude by the binding of GTPase activating proteins ( GAPs ) , which deliver additional functional groups to the active site to provide transition state stabilization ( 60 ) . By analogy , an attractive mechanism accounting for the enhanced ATPase rate associated with actin polymerization would be that neighboring subunits in the filament provide additional functional groups that facilitate ATP hydrolysis . However , examination of the Holmes model for the actin filament shows that the closest approach of an appropriate functionality from a neighboring subunit to the (cid:5) - phosphoryl is at a distance of (cid:4) 17 Å , indicating that a very different mechanism for activation must be operating . Considerable structural work has indicated that the trimeric G proteins exist in an autoinhibited state that exhibits inefficient turnover . In contrast to the small G protein GAPs , the regulators of G protein signaling ( RGSs ) responsible for activation of the trimeric G proteins do not make any direct contacts with GTP in the active site . Instead , the RGSs induce a small rearrange - ment of active site residues that promotes the formation of a catalytically active conformation , resulting in rate enhancements of up to several orders of magnitude ( 49 , 61 ) ( reviewed in ref . 62 ) . In the case of the actin filament , we propose a modification of this mechanism in which the lateral and longitudinal contacts formed during polymerization result in a conformational rear - rangement of catalytic residues , especially His - 161 and perhaps Gln - 137 , which accounts for the enhanced hydrolytic activity of the actin filament . Several recent demonstrations of structural plasticity within the monomer ( 44 , 63 ) and the filament ( 64 – 67 ) are consistent with this notion . Furthermore , given the great paucity of appropriate functionalities in the vicinity of the (cid:5) - phosphoryl , we speculate that the conformational alterations associated with polymerization may also contribute to the en - hanced ATPase activity of the filament through ground state destabilization . This proposal is analogous to that recently suggested for ras , in which Mg 2 (cid:2) - GTP begins to acquire tran - sition - state - like features ( i . e . , geometry and bond order ) in the enzyme - bound ground state ( 68 ) . 5764 (cid:3) www . pnas . org (cid:2) cgi (cid:2) doi (cid:2) 10 . 1073 (cid:2) pnas . 0832273100 Vorobiev et al . Implications for the Actin - Related Proteins ( Arps ) . Actin also pro - vides a framework for examining the mechanistic considerations relevant to members of the family of Arps . The P loops in all of the Arps show significant conservation with actin , indicating that all Arps may have the potential to bind nucleotide ( Table 2 , which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site ) ( 28 – 30 , 33 ) . Of particular note is the Arp2 (cid:2) 3 complex that is responsible for de novo nucleation of actin filaments . ATP hydrolysis appears to be required for Arp2 (cid:2) 3 function , and structural ( 34 , 69 ) and biochemical ( 70 ) data suggest that ATP hydrolysis is coupled with a conformational reorganization within the Arp2 (cid:2) 3 complex , which allows the Arp2 and Arp3 subunits to adopt an arrangement that mimics the growing barbed end of an actin filament and promotes the nucleation of new filaments . Like actin , both Arp2 and Arp3 possess the equivalent of Gln - 137 and His - 161 , suggesting mechanistic sim - ilarities for nucleotide hydrolysis . Importantly , the Arp2 (cid:2) 3 com - plex does not exhibit measurable ATPase activity , either alone or in the presence of its activators N - WASP and F - actin ( 70 ) . As the majority of Arp2 (cid:2) 3 activators contain a G - actin binding domain ( termed the WH2 module ) in close proximity to the Arp2 (cid:2) 3 binding domain , it has been suggested that the role of the WH2 module is to promote an interaction between a filament - associated Arp2 (cid:2) 3 complex and an actin monomer , resulting in stimulation of the Arp2 (cid:2) 3 ATPase activity ( 70 ) . This hypothesis shares considerable similarity with our proposed mechanism for the rate enhancement of the actin ATPase associated with actin polymerization . Finally , the recent Ca 2 (cid:2) - ADP - G - actin structure ( 45 ) , and a host biochemical studies ( 52 ) , implicate Ser - 14 , Ser - 33 Tyr - 69 , Asp - 157 , and Arg - 183 as key components of the mechanism that directs the nucleotide - dependent conforma - tional properties of the actin monomer ( 45 ) . Identical or highly conservative residues are present at these positions in both Arp2 and Arp3 , suggesting that these molecules couple nucleotide state and conformation via a mechanism similar to that used by actin .
