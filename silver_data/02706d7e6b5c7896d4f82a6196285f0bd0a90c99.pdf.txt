This study examines the impact of ride - sharing services , which is one of the most successful business models in sharing economy , on taxi industry . Using comprehensive data on Uber and taxi transactions in New York City from April to September 2014 , we find that ride - sharing is negatively associated with the demand for taxis . Interestingly , this effect is contingent upon market - and customer - segments . The negative effect of Uber on taxis is mostly driven in Manhattan and high - income areas , where most taxis are concentrated . Furthermore , our analyses reveal that ride - sharing services take more demand of taxi customers who pay by cash and who are price - sensitive , by providing relative advantages of ride - sharing platforms . In addition , taxi customers in groups appear to more switch to ride - sharing services . Relevant implications for both research and practice are discussed . 1 . Introduction Sharing economy has received notable attention in the last few years , and information technology ( IT ) - enabled sharing platforms have rapidly expanded . According to the research of PwC [ 37 ] , sharing economy grows more than 30 % annually , and it is expected that the scale of sharing economy would reach the scale of traditional economy sectors in 2025 . By virtue of its dominance in the global market , ride - sharing has recently come to the forefront of the debate on sharing economy . Uber Technologies Inc . ( “Uber” hereafter ) , the world’s largest ride - sharing platform , rapidly expanded at an unprecedented scale . With the rapid growth of sharing economy , there has been a growing debate on the disruptive nature of the sharing economy to threaten traditional industry [ 13 ] . The disruptive force of the sharing economy has raised challenges for incumbent industries as well as policy makers . Zervas et al . [ 50 ] suggest that the 10 % increase of Airbnb listing leads to the 0 . 39 % decrease in hotel revenue . In particular , as one of the most successful business models in sharing economy , the questions about the societal impacts of ride - sharing on taxi industry are part of a larger debate over regulation of sharing economy [ 33 ] . Despite their enormous societal impacts , there is surprisingly little systematic evidence on the relationship between ride - sharing and taxi industry . Although many detractors and regulators in major cities have raised concerns on cannibalization of taxi demand by the ride - sharing services , the narrative about the competition between ride - sharing services and taxis is largely anecdotal . Thus , we have limited understanding of how the increased usages of ride - sharing platforms affect the demand for taxis . To bridge this gap , this study aims at answering the research questions : ( 1 ) Whether and how much does ride - sharing impact the demand for taxis ? ( 2 ) If so , which customers does ride - sharing take from the taxi industry ? It is noteworthy that the effects of IT - enabled new services and business models on conventional ones have been widely covered in the information systems ( IS ) literature , though these effects are not always negative . For instance , Ghose et al . [ 21 ] repute a widespread concern that IT - enabled used - product market will significantly cannibalize new product sales , as mentioning that “this proposition , while theoretically possible , is based on speculation as opposed to empirical evidence . ” Danaher et al . [ 14 ] also suggest that digital distribution channels are poor substitutes for physical sales . Hence , quantifying the impact of ride - sharing on taxi industry is important not only for practitioners and policy makers , but also for researchers . Figure 1 shows the trends in Uber and taxi transactions in NYC over the period April to September , 2014 . The usage of Uber has doubled during 6 months , whereas transactions of taxis have decreased by approximately 5 % . However , as neither controlling for important region - and time - specific heterogeneity nor Proceedings of the 51 st Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences | 2018 URI : http : / / hdl . handle . net / 10125 / 49970 ISBN : 978 - 0 - 9981331 - 1 - 9 ( CC BY - NC - ND 4 . 0 ) Page 656 reflecting an appropriate econometric model for the interplay between Uber and taxis , these patterns of Uber and taxis leave it ambiguous whether the demand change for taxis can be attributable to the growth of ride - sharing . Figure 1 . Trends in Uber and taxi pickups in NYC To examine the impact of ride - sharing on taxi industry , we use fine - grained datasets on Uber and taxi pickup transactions in New York City ( NYC ) for the period April to September 2014 with over 800 , 000 zip code - hour level observations . As our identification strategy , we employ three - stage least squares ( 3SLS ) regression model to estimate a simultaneous interaction between taxi and Uber , enabling us to address a potential simultaneous bias . Further , we explore the contingent effects depending on market - and customer - segments to provide deeper understanding of how ride - sharing services compete with taxis . Our findings demonstrate that Uber and taxi are directly competing with each other in NYC , as consistent with a conventional view . The 10 % increase in the number of Uber pickups leads to the 0 . 12 % decrease in the number of overall taxi pickups in NYC , at all reasonable levels of significance . What is most striking , though , is that the effect of Uber on taxi demand is contingent upon market - and customer - segments . The negative effect of Uber on taxis is mainly driven in Manhattan and high - income areas , where most taxis are concentrated . Furthermore , our analyses reveal that ride - sharing services take more demand of taxi customers who pay by cash and who are price - sensitive , by providing relative advantages of ride - sharing platforms . In addition , taxi customers in groups appear to more switch to ride - sharing services . This paper offers the following key contributions . First , this is the first study to quantify and provide systematic evidence on the impact of ride - sharing on taxi market , using a large - scale dataset and an appropriate econometric model . This study extends the evidence of the sharing economy’s disruptive nature into the ride - sharing , though we document distinct effects of Uber on taxi demand by region and income level . Notably , given that ride - sharing has grown more rapidly in outer boroughs and low - income areas ( see Figure 3 ) , our findings highlight the critical role of ride - sharing in expanding transportation options for the markets underserved by taxis , while not cannibalizing the taxi demand . Second , we differentiate various types of taxi customers and find that the Uber’s impact is different depending on customer - segments . In practical terms , this study provides managerial implications that ride - sharing companies need a target marketing strategy to effectively capture customer demands depending on customer - segments and spatiotemporal characteristics . In addition , our findings are also encouraging for taxi industry because all markets are not cannibalized by ride - sharing services . 2 . Literature Review In the IS literature , a large stream of studies covers the competition between IT - enabled new services and conventional ( offline ) ones . For instance , prior literature has paid attention to whether digital goods and digitally distributed contents cannibalize the demand for physical goods [ 14 , 43 ] . In addition , many studies investigate how the emergence of electronic commerce can affect brick - and - mortar stores [ 4 , 7 , 8 ] . In the literature , IT - enabled services and business models are not always substitutes for conventional ones , rather their effects have been reported as insignificant or even positive , expanding the market without cannibalization for conventional services [ 14 , 21 ] . In line with this literature , there is a bitter controversy over the disruptive nature of IT - enabled sharing economy to threaten traditional industry which is mainly based on offline businesses . Zervas et al . [ 50 ] provide the first systematic evidence of how sharing economy competes with traditional industry in the case of Airbnb and hotel industry . Using a city - month level difference - in - difference setting , they empirically investigate the impact of Airbnb’s entry on hotel industry , arguing that the 10 % increase of Airbnb listing affect the 0 . 39 % decrease in hotel revenue . Surprisingly , however , there is little systematic empirical evidence on the relationship between ride - sharing and taxi industry , which is one of the most successful business models in sharing economy . In the absence of rigorous empirical evidence , there are a number of mixed opinions in the industry about the effect of ride - sharing on taxi demand . FiveThirtyEight , an Internet media , compares the frequency of monthly taxi pickups in NYC between 2014 and 2015 , arguing that Uber is taking millions of Manhattan rides away from taxis [ 18 ] . The Economist [ 45 ] also suggests that the average price for NYC’s medallions has fallen from Page 657 one million dollars in 2014 to 0 . 7 million dollars in 2015 . However , they claim that “attributing these woes to Uber is difficult , ” given that Uber is not taxis’ only new source of competition because the NYC introduced boro taxis and bicycle - sharing systems in 2013 . In addition , not all Uber passengers would otherwise have hopped in a cab . Rayle et al . [ 39 ] suggest that 39 % of their survey participants said that they would have used a taxi if ride - sharing services were not available . However , previous studies have several notable limitations to be addressed in this study . First , these studies mostly rely on aggregate level data , such as city and month level . These results should be suffered from aggregation problems and confounding effects . Especially , the spatial - temporal variation of taxi and Uber is more evident than other markets such as accommodation . To the extent that there may be variation in the effects depending on region and time , understating these spatiotemporal effects and isolating the magnitude of them are important in assessing the ride - sharing effects . Thus , our granular level data on trip record for Uber and taxis in NYC allow us to exploit spatiotemporal variations of Uber and taxi transactions , and further investigate the distinct effects of ride - sharing by region and time . Second , assessing and quantifying the causal effects of ride - sharing on taxi demand poses an empirical challenge due to endogeneity , making identification difficult . For instance , Wallsten [ 48 ] presents the evidence of the relationship between Uber’s popularity and the decline of consumer complaints per trip about taxis in NYC , possibly due to taking away taxi’s customers or improving taxis’ service in response to the new competition . However , the author also mentions that “the data do not make it possible to derive the magnitude of the effects of Uber . ” Quantifying the impact of ride - sharing on taxi industry is essential to provide implications for practitioners and policy makers , given that it has been subject to much debate among them . Hence , with granular level datasets and an appropriate econometric technique , this study attempts to quantify the impact of ride - sharing on taxi industry . 3 . Hypothesis Development 3 . 1 . Competition between ride - sharing and taxi According to the framework of competitor analysis [ 9 ] , the degree of competition is determined by market commonality and resource similarity . Given that ride - sharing and taxi provide similar riding services for customers , it is reasonable to conjecture that the increased usages of ride - sharing platforms would reduce the demand for taxis . Furthermore , the disruptive power of ride - sharing stems from the characteristics of online platforms . IT - enabled platforms could dramatically lower search costs [ 3 ] and facilitate buyer - seller match , leading to a frictionless market [ 8 ] . Contrary to taxi services , ride - sharing platforms facilitate to seamlessly connect customers to the nearest driver when they request a ride . Reduced search costs could allow people to hire more ride - sharing drivers . In addition , people would be more likely to use ride - sharing platforms because the ride - sharing services offer a significant price reduction over traditional taxis ( e . g . , UberX ) and are quite easy to use and useful ; otherwise they would be unlikely to do [ 22 ] . We thus propose the following hypothesis to be empirically tested as a baseline : Hypothesis 1 . Ride - sharing services will be negatively associated with the demand for taxis . 3 . 2 . Contingent effects of market segments The mixed opinions of ride - sharing’s impacts on taxi industry may be attributed to not only the absence of empirical evidence , but also its contingency depending on market - and customer - related factors . The inherent feature of online platforms to reduce search costs can influence the market commonality , and consequently the degree of competition between ride - sharing services and taxis . In the taxi market , search costs are substantial not only for customers as buyers , but also for drivers as sellers . Patron relies on stochastic discovery of a taxi by standing on the street . Taxi drivers get around to search for uncertain , potential customers across the city if not arranged by calls in advance . Due to high search costs , taxi drivers tend to be concentrated spatially in downtown and temporally during the daytime or rush hour , making customer’s search costs higher in the taxi - sparse areas and time . Hence , the costs for searching taxi and ride - sharing services will be low enough to easily get both in the taxi - dense areas . Cramer and Krueger [ 12 ] find that the capacity utilization rates of taxi and Uber drivers are much more similar in NYC than in other cities . The authors suggest that the high population density of NYC supports more efficient matching of taxis and passengers through street hailing than is the case in other cities . While they do not separate out Manhattan from outer boroughs in NYC , their argument is valid only in Manhattan where most taxis are concentrated ( more than 90 % ) . On the other hand , contrary to taxi services , ride - sharing platforms could reduce driver’s search costs , as well as customers’ ones , through seamless driver - rider match . Ride - sharing platforms facilitate to seamlessly connect customers to the nearest driver when they request a ride . Using a simulation approach in Page 658 estimating a dynamic general equilibrium model of the taxi market in NYC in 2011 - 2012 , Frechette et al . [ 19 ] argue that it was estimated to reduce the search time for taxis by 9 . 3 percent if assuming that drivers knew the location of the closest passengers , as the case of ride - sharing platforms . Reduced drivers’ search costs increases expected payoffs from driving in the suburbs of the city , leading to a broader services provision . Figure 2 highlights different geographical patterns of taxi and Uber in NYC . The study of University of California Transportation Center [ 39 ] suggests that wait times of on - demand ride services are markedly shorter and more consistent that those of taxis in San Francisco . In addition , 30 % of respondents in their survey said that short wait time is the reason why they chose ride - sharing , which is the second highest . Figure 2 . Uber and taxi pickups in NYC Notes : We plot 150 , 000 random sample from yellow taxi pickups and 50 , 000 from boro taxi transactions during April 2014 . Uber pickups are plotted based on 200 , 000 random sample during April 2014 . In the taxi - sparse areas , search costs for taxi will be higher than those for ride - sharing , making ride - sharing and Uber serve different types of customers by their marginal values for search costs . On the other hand , in the taxi - dense areas , market commonality is high and customers would treat the services of ride - sharing and taxi similarly , making the competition more intensive . According to Chen [ 9 ] , the competition intensifies when market commonality is high ; thus , logically , we expect that the impact of ride - sharing on taxis will be greater in the taxi - dense areas than taxi - sparse areas . This is largely consistent with Brynjolfsson et al . [ 7 ] , who suggest that the competition between the Internet retailers and brick - and - mortar is much more intensive when selling famous products than niche products which consumers have a difficulty in finding in a traditional offline market . For a goal of empirical testing , we operationalize the taxi - dense areas as Manhattan in NYC and high - income areas . As shown in Figure 2 , taxi availability depends on boroughs in NYC . In addition , many studies suggest that low - income areas are underserved markets by traditional transportation such as taxi , and Uber has the potential to expand transportation option there . Using a controlled study in low - income neighborhoods in Los Angeles , Smart et al . [ 42 ] show that an app - summoned UberX arrives in less than half the time of a telephone - dispatched taxi , and more reliable with no wait time exceeding 30 minutes . Meyer [ 34 ] show that Uber are expanding transportation options in low - income areas in NYC . Therefore , we propose the following : Hypothesis 2 . The effect of ride - sharing services on taxi demand will be greater in Manhattan than outer boroughs in NYC . Hypothesis 3 . The effect of ride - sharing services on taxi demand will be greater in high - income neighborhoods than low - income neighborhoods . 3 . 3 . Contingent effects of customer segments Consumers face non - negligible costs of switching between different services for a new kind of services or technologies . In particular , access to IT or smartphones may be proffered as a barrier to widespread adoption of new ride - sharing services . Given that taxis are operating across cities before the introduction of ride - sharing services , the switching costs may play a critical role in the competition between them . The lower the switching costs for ride - sharing are , the more ride - sharing will reduce the taxi demand . In this study , we propose two factors which could influence customers’ switching behavior and subsequently the competition between new sharing economy platforms and traditional industry : relative advantage and perceived risks . Relative advantage refers to the degree to which consumers regard an alternative service to be superior to the conventional service , and it receives tremendous attentions as one of the factors to facilitate innovation adoption and diffusion [ 2 , 40 ] . As consumers perceive more advantage and usefulness a service or product offers , they tend to more adopt and expect more investment in learning the service or product [ 15 , 25 ] . Huang and Hsieh [ 24 ] suggest that relative advantage directly affects the switching costs and their acceptance behavior . Thus , we expect that perceived relative advantage may influence the switching behavior of taxi customers to new ride - sharing services . The ride - sharing services have been embraced , in part , because it is cashless and its fare is automatically charged to rider’s credit card after rolling up to destination . Cashless exchange systems make it easy for the users to pay seamlessly . Of many features of IT - enabled ride - sharing platforms , ease of payment was the most attractive reasons to use ride - sharing ( 35 % of survey respondents ) , according to a survey of Rayle et al . [ 39 ] . Furthermore , Uber maintains its policy that “tips are not included on Uber’s platforms , and that tipping is neither expected nor required” [ 35 ] , making Page 659 Uber more attractive to the price - sensitive customers who are not willing to pay large tips . As a form of price discrimination , tipping allows some customers to pay less than others for the same service , and price - sensitive customers are willing to reduce the total cost of services by leaving smaller tips [ 23 , 32 ] . In this regard , we expect that taxi customers who pay by cash and price - sensitive customers who give a smaller tip percentage ( i . e . , percentage of total fare ) will perceive higher relative advantage of ride - sharing over taxi , as there’s no riffling through wallet for small bills or tips . Therefore , we propose the following : Hypothesis 4 . Ride - sharing services will reduce the demand for taxi customers paying by cash more than those paying by credit card . Hypothesis 5 . Ride - sharing services will reduce the demand for taxi customers giving a small tip percentage more than those giving a large tip percentage . In addition , there are implicit switching costs associated with decision biases and risk aversion [ 10 ] . People who have never used , or have little used a new service feel risk toward the new service . This type of risk is originated from the uncertainties about the service , and it deters risk - averse consumers from switching to and accepting new service or technology . In the context of peer - to - peer ( P2P ) - based sharing economy , functional and physical risk may play a key role in the adoption of the new services because its supplier is not firms but individuals . Therefore , people who are not familiar with ride - sharing services may perceive risk for safety and uncertainty for its utility . Decision on technology adoption is made collectively by the group through a process of communication and negotiation [ 41 ] , and social influence can act as an antecedent to technology adoption [ 46 ] . There is an extensive social psychology literature addressing group versus individual decision making [ 26 ] . In particular , previous studies suggest that people made a decision in group tend to be more risk - taking than people made a decision alone [ 44 , 47 ] . Dion et al . [ 16 ] propose four possible explanations for making riskier decision in a group : diffusion of responsibility , persuasion , familiarization , and cultural value . That is , they share their risk with other people in the group [ 17 ] . Gardner and Steinberg [ 20 ] suggest that when in peer groups than alone , the experiment participants took more risks and focused more on the benefits than costs of risky behavior . In addition , peer influence affects an user’s switching intention in social network services [ 49 ] and increases the impulsive purchasing [ 31 ] . Taken together , to the extent that the perceived risk or uncertainty acts as switching costs for ride - sharing services , group customers will be more favorable toward new technology or services , than individual consumers . Thus , we propose the following : Hypothesis 6 . Ride - sharing services will reduce the demand for taxi customers in group more than those alone . 4 . Methodology 4 . 1 . Data In this study , we employ zip code - hour level panel data on Uber and taxi pickup transactions in NYC over the period from April to September 2014 . NYC provides an ideal setting for our study because Uber has been active there since May 2011 , and NYC is today one of its biggest and most controversial markets . As of 2015 , Lyft provided only 7 % of rides summoned over the Internet in NYC , compared with Uber’s 90 % [ 6 ] . In addition , while yellow cabs still make 10 times more trips than Uber cars in the city , more Uber cars were on the road than yellow taxis in NYC in 2015 [ 36 ] . This sample period also rules out the possibility of competitors’ influences ( such as Lyft ) because Uber was the market - dominating company in NYC before 2015 . FiveThirtyEight obtained the Uber transaction data from the from NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission ( TLC ) by submitting a Freedom of Information Law request . This dataset contains over 4 . 5 million Uber pickups in NYC from April to September 2014 . Additionally , we use data on approximately 90 million taxi pickup transactions for this period from the official NYC TLC trip records . Each individual trip record contains precise location coordinates and timestamps for where and when the trip started . Uber and taxi pickup locations are specified in their latitude and longitude to four decimal places . To convert their locations into zip code level , we match the latitude and longitude to the corresponding zip code , using a geographical information systems software . Data that returned null values or zip codes outside NYC are dropped . Our final panel dataset includes 191 zip codes , and consequently 838 , 872 zip code - hour observations . It is worth noting that TLC also provides information on various attributes of taxi transactions in NYC , allowing us to segment customer types . The TLC trip record dataset includes transaction information about fare , tip amount , number of passenger , and payment method . Table 1 summarizes the variables used in our datasets .

Empirical model Assessing the causal relationship between Uber and taxis poses an empirical challenge due to endogeneity . There are several potential sources of endogeneity that may lead to biased estimation . Firstly , there would be omitted variables that will potentially affect the demand for both Uber and taxis . Another potential source of endogeneity could be reverse causality or simultaneity bias because taxis and Uber interplay with each other . That is , taxi may affect the demand of Uber , as well as Uber influences the demand for taxis . To address the potential endogeneity problems , we employ 3SLS model , which combines two - stage least squares ( 2SLS ) with seemingly unrelated regression ( SUR ) . The 3SLS approach estimates the full system of equations where endogenous variables in an equation are used as explanatory variables in other equations . It is widely adopted when dealing with endogeneity and contemporaneous cross - equation correlation between error terms [ 27 , 29 ] . In particular , this approach is recommended to model a triangular structural relationship [ 28 ] , allowing us to consider the simultaneous interaction between Uber and taxis . Specifically , we estimate the system of equations : ln 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛽𝛽 11 ln 𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑟𝑟 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽 21 ln 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖−1 + 𝛽𝛽 31 ln 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖−168 + 𝜇𝜇 𝑖𝑖1 + 𝜈𝜈 𝑖𝑖1 + 𝜀𝜀 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖1 ln 𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑟𝑟 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛽𝛽 12 ln 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽 22 ln 𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑟𝑟 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖−1 + 𝛽𝛽 32 ln 𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑟𝑟 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖−168 + 𝜇𝜇 𝑖𝑖2 + 𝜈𝜈 𝑖𝑖2 + 𝜀𝜀 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖2 where 𝜇𝜇 𝑖𝑖 is zip code - specific effects invariant over time , 𝜈𝜈 𝑖𝑖 is time - specific effects common across regions , and 𝜀𝜀 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is a random error in zip code i in time t . The variables of 𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑟𝑟 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 and 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , which are the frequency of pickup transactions of Uber and taxi , are log - transformed to mitigate negative skewness of its distribution , after adding one to account for zero values . We are primarily interested in 𝛽𝛽 11 , which represents the percentage change in taxi transactions associated with one percent increase in Uber transactions . In addition , we include 168 hours ( one week ) lagged term as instrument variables . The instruments should be correlated with the endogenous regressor but uncorrelated with the dependent variable through any channel other than their effects via the endogenous regressor . Since there is much fluctuation in taxi and Uber transactions depending on day - of - week and time - of - day , we believe that the demand for transportation before a week is more appropriate instruments for the current demand . Our model also allows for the dynamic nature of Uber and taxi pickups by including variables for lagged frequency of pickups between two successive hours . The current frequency of taxi and Uber pickups can be correlated with the past pickups in two opposite ways . On one hand , previous taxi pickups may reduce the probability of street hailing in the next hour . On the other hand , the demand for taxis and Uber can be concentrated in specific time periods , such as rush hour . In this case , the current taxi pickups will be positively correlated with the past pickup transactions . Furthermore , we can deal with time - series specific effects such as autocorrelation in the demand for taxis and Uber by including one hour lagged term of the dependent variables [ 1 ] . Unobserved local conditions such as geographical ( e . g . , tourist attractions ) , demographic ( e . g . , race , gender ) and socioeconomic factors ( e . g . , income ) may have heterogeneous effects on both Uber and taxi demands . To account for region - specific effects , zip code dummies are included . In addition , we also include date ( 183 days ) and time - of - day ( 24 hours ) dummies to control for time - specific transportation demands or unobserved factors ( e . g . , events ) . 5 . Results 5 . 1 . Impact of Uber on taxi demand Page 661 To examine whether and how the frequency of Uber transactions affects the demand for taxis , we estimate the empirical model using our full sample of 838 , 872 zip code - hour observations , which pools 191 zip codes in NYC over six months in 2014 . Table 2 reports our estimation results of the simultaneous competition between Uber and taxis . Each column in the table corresponds to a different regression . Table 2 .

The impact of Uber on overall taxi market is significantly negative , and the 10 % increase in Uber pickups leads to the 0 . 12 % decrease in overall taxi pickups , accepting the Hypothesis 1 . On the other hand , the Uber pickups decrease by 0 . 31 % as the taxi pickups increase by 10 % . To explore the contingent effects upon market - segments , we extend the baseline model by including interaction terms between focal independent variables ( e . g . , ln 𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑟𝑟 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) and dummy variables of borough and income level . We obtain data about average household income for each zip code from U . S . Census Bureau . We code a binary variable , 𝑀𝑀𝑇𝑇𝑀𝑀ℎ𝑇𝑇𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑇𝑇𝑀𝑀 , as 1 if the zip code areas belong to that borough . In addition , we categorize zip code areas into three groups based on income distribution in NYC ; 𝑀𝑀𝑇𝑇𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑈𝑈 𝑇𝑇𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑈𝑈 is defined as zip code areas which reside between the 25th ( $ 60 , 564 ) and 75th ( $ 99 , 142 ) percentile of household income ; and the remaining areas with higher and lower income are assigned into 𝐻𝐻𝑇𝑇𝐻𝐻ℎ 𝑇𝑇𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑈𝑈 and 𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖𝐿𝐿 𝑇𝑇𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑈𝑈 , respectively . Note that the baselines are outer boroughs in NYC and low - income areas , respectively . Similarly to main terms , the interaction terms may be endogenous . For instance , the Uber transactions are endogenous in both Manhattan and outer boroughs in NYC , thus we need to address the endegeneity of interaction term . In the prior literature [ 5 , 29 ] , it is widely accepted to instrument interactions of endogenous variables with interactions with instruments . Following this approach , instead of using the interaction terms that may be endogenous , we reestimate the model by including the interaction terms with instruments . Columns 2 and 3 in Table 2 provide intriguing findings that the Uber’s impacts on taxi demand are contingent upon borough and income level . In Column 2 , the impact of Uber on taxis in Manhattan is significant , but not in outer boroughs , supporting the Hypothesis 2 . In Manhattan , the 10 % increase in Uber pickups leads to the 0 . 14 % decrease in taxi pickups . On the other hand , the impact of Uber on taxi market in low - income areas is insignificant and negligible ( Column 3 ) , whereas its impact is negatively significant in middle - and high - income areas , supporting the Hypothesis 3 . When the Uber pickups increase by 10 % , taxi pickups decrease by 0 . 17 % in higher - income areas . 5 . 2 . Customer - segment analysis In order to investigate whether the effects of Uber vary depending on the characteristics of taxi customers , we split the taxi transactions based on its attributes : tip percentage , group ride , and payment method ( see Table 1 for summary statistics ) . Specifically , all taxi transactions whose ratio of tip to total fare ( tip percentage ) is above median are divided into large tip segment , or else into small tip segment . Also , all taxi transactions whose number of passenger , reported by drivers , is two or more are classified into group - ride segment , whose number of passenger is one is classified into single - ride segment . Cash and credit card segments are classified by payment for each taxi transactions . Page 662 Table 3 . Results of customer - segment analysis DV : Cash vs . Credit Card ( H4 ) Small Tip vs .

Table 3 reports our estimation results for the impacts of Uber on each customer segment . As shown in Columns 1 and 2 , Uber seems to take more the demand of taxi customers who pay by cash than credit card , accepting Hypothesis 4 . The 10 % increase of Uber transactions causes the 0 . 22 % and 0 . 16 % decrease in taxi transactions whose payment method is cash and credit card , respectively , implying that the cashless payment of Uber is perceived as an important relative advantage over taxis . In Columns 3 and 4 , the negative impact of Uber on the taxi transactions with a small tip is significantly larger than those who pay a large tip ( p < 0 . 05 ) , as consistent with the Hypothesis 5 . The 10 % increase of Uber transactions leads to the 0 . 19 % and 0 . 17 % decrease in taxi pickup transactions with a large and small tip percentage , respectively . Thus , these results imply that ride - sharing services take more the demand of taxi customers who are more price - sensitive , due to Uber’s no - tipping policy . In Columns 5 and 6 , we can accept the Hypothesis 7 , as the demand elasticity of Uber for group taxi rides is more than twice as large as for single taxi rides . The 10 % increase of Uber transactions is associated with the 0 . 30 % and 0 . 12 % decrease in group taxi ride and single taxi ride , respectively . The large difference between group and single taxi ride implies that perceived risk may play a critical role in customers’ attitude to new IT - enabled services and P2P - based sharing economy . 6 . Discussion and Conclusions This study provides intriguing and encouraging findings of societal benefits of ride - sharing . Our findings demonstrated that the negative effect of Uber on taxi demand seems to be mainly driven by Manhattan and high - income areas , where most taxis are concentrated , although the Uber’s impact is insignificant in the outskirts ( outer boroughs ) and low - income areas . The suburbs and low - income areas have been underserved by public transits and street - hail transportations [ 11 , 34 ] , possibly undermining the quality of life and social welfare . Figure 3 shows the trends of Uber transactions by income level during the sample period . The growth of Uber pickups is more evident in middle - and low - income areas , and the percentage of Uber transactions there has increased over time , contrary to taxis . Thus , our findings highlight that ride - sharing services can be effective in expanding transportation options in these underserved markets , without cannibalizing the demand for taxis there . This paper offers important contributions and implications to literature and practice . First , this study can contribute to the nascent literature on societal impacts of sharing economy . The availability of ride - sharing can reduce the likelihood of alcohol - related motor vehicle fatalities [ 22 ] and also can reduce traffic congestion and excess fuel consumption [ 30 ] . Our work extends the evidence of the societal impacts of sharing economy by documenting the relationship between ride - sharing and the incumbent taxi industry . Page 663 Figure 3 . Trends in Uber pickups by income level Second , we documented the distinct impacts of Uber on taxi demand by region and income level . Rawls [ 38 ] proposes the social welfare measure based on the welfare level for the least well - off people in society , referred to as Rawlsian utility function . From the Rawls’ perspective , increasing social welfare of the lower - income people can lead to the improve of overall social welfare . Thus , our study illustrates a new channel through which ride - sharing platforms improve social welfare beyond economic gains by expanding transportation options mostly in low - income areas without cannibalizing the taxi demand . This may reshape the ongoing dialogues on the sharing economy and inform democratic debate on ride - sharing and sharing economy that have been subject to much debate among researchers and policy makers . These differing impacts of ride - sharing by regions can provide a possible way for policy makers to reconcile the conflicting opinions from the traditional industry , consumers , and sharing economy players . Third , we attempted to differentiate types of taxi customers , providing managerial implications for sharing platform companies as well as traditional industry . Our findings imply that ride - sharing companies may need a target marketing strategy to effectively capture customer demands depending on customers’ characteristics . In addition , the results are encouraging for taxi industry because all markets are not cannibalized by the new competition with ride - sharing . This study is also not without limitations . First , our findings may be limited by the sample period in 2014 , a relatively early stage of Uber growth in NYC . Given that the impacts of Uber may be depending on its growth phase , one should be cautious in generalizing our results to other periods or other cities which may experience different stages of ride - sharing adoption . In addition , our fine - grained analyses can effectively capture the short - term direct cannibalizing effects of ride - sharing services , though it may not capture the long - term impacts of ride - sharing on taxi industry , such as its structural change caused by Uber’s flexible labor supply model [ 12 ] . The total impacts of ride - sharing , including short - term and long - term effects , on taxi industry might be broader and greater than our estimates . Second , since NYC is one of the world’s largest cities and hosts many ride - sharing drivers , the effects of ride - sharing there might differ from those in other cities . In addition , different regulations for ride - sharing might affect their competitive relationship . Future studies could extend our empirical findings to other contexts , such as other cities and other countries . 7 . References [ 1 ] Archak , N . , Ghose , A . , and Ipeirotis , P . G .
