Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol ( January 6 , 2017 ) . doi : 10 . 1152 / ajplung . 00486 . 2016 Copyright © 2017 by the American Physiological Society . 2 Abstract 13 Various pathophysiological conditions such as surfactant dysfunction , mechanical ventilation , inflammation , 14 pathogen products , environmental exposures and gastric acid aspiration stress lung cells and the compromise of 15 plasma membranes occur as a result . The mechanisms necessary for cells to repair plasma membrane defects have 16 been extensively investigated in the last two decades , and some of these key repair mechanisms are also shown to 17 occur following lung cell injury . As it was theorized that lung wounding and repair are involved in the 18 pathogenesis of acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ( IPF ) , in this 19 review , we summarized the experimental evidence of lung cell injury in these two devastating syndromes , discuss 20 relevant genetic , physical and biological injury mechanisms , as well as mechanisms utilized by lung cells for cell 21 survival and membrane repair . Finally , we discuss relevant signalling pathways that may be activated by chronic 22 or repeated lung cell injury as an extension of our cell injury and repair focus in this review . We hope that a 23 holistic view of injurious stimuli relevant for ARDS and IPF could lead to updated experimental models . In 24 addition , parallel discussion of membrane repair mechanisms in lung cells and injury - activated signalling 25 pathways would encourage research to bridge gaps in current knowledge . Indeed , deep understanding of lung cell 26 wounding and repair , and discovery of relevant repair moieties for lung cells should inspire the development of 27 new therapies that are likely preventive and broadly effective for targeting injurious pulmonary diseases . 28 Key words : membrane repair ; lung cells ; acute respiratory distress syndrome ; epithelium mesenchymal crosstalk ; 29 pulmonary fibrosis ; 30 31 3 Introduction 32 The plasma membrane of eukaryotic cells is composed of a phospholipid bilayer decorated with proteins and 33 transporters , which are selectively permeable to gases , ions , nutrients , hormones , solid particles and 34 macromolecules in a tightly regulated fashion . Various functional tasks stress living cells in tissue on a daily basis , 35 such as abrasion and acid erosion in the gastrointestinal tract , stretching and compression in the muscle tissues , 36 and hydrostatic pressure in the cardiovascular system . In addition , bacterial toxins , inflammatory cytokines , 37 immune complexes and harmful environmental exposures directly damage the plasma membrane or impede the 38 cellular repair process . Severe or irreversible injuries to the plasma membrane result in intracellular components 39 escaping the cell , and poisonous extracellular components flushing into the cell , leading to compromised cellular 40 functions or even cell death . Thus , similar to the need for the well - elucidated DNA repair mechanisms ( 284 ) , 41 intrinsic membrane repair mechanisms to rescue the deteriorating fate of a broken cell is an evolutionally 42 favourable and likely conserved trait among different cell types , tissues and species ( 164 , 176 , 177 ) . 43 The concept of membrane repair was put forward by Paul McNeil and colleagues in the 90s ( 246 ) and extensive 44 studies were conducted to reveal the cellular events of plasma membrane repair ( 49 , 175 ) . Generally , it is believed 45 that lateral flow of the lipid bilayer alone , driven by thermodynamic gradient , is sufficient to reseal small 46 membrane disruptions ( nm range ) in nucleated cells and most of membrane damages in non - nucleated cells . On 47 the other hand , exocytotic lipid trafficking plus lateral lipid flow could prevent permanent cell damage upon 48 membrane disruptions of the µm range , while remedy of even larger membrane wounds requires fusion of 49 exocytotic lipid vesicles into a repair “patch” through highly choreographed steps . Furthermore , it has been shown 50 that removal of the disorganized plasma membrane wounds either through endocytosis ( 51 , 243 ) or exocytotic 51 budding ( 116 ) is also critical for effective membrane repair . Meanwhile , depolymerisation of subcortical 52 cytoskeleton at the time of exocytotic vesicle trafficking , and repolymerisation afterwards to restore cell 53 morphology , are shown to be integral steps of the membrane repair process ( 86 ) . 54 Lung cells are exposed to both environmental insults and physical - biological stresses and thus highly susceptible 55 to plasma membrane injuries . Pertinent to the focus on pulmonary diseases in this review , disruptions of lung cell 56 membrane following mechanical stresses were first captured on transmission electron microscopic ( EM ) images 57 in the 90s ( 53 , 64 ) . Later studies established an association between lung cell injury and death with pathogenesis of 58 injurious pulmonary diseases including acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) ( 59 , 199 ) and idiopathic 59 pulmonary fibrosis ( IPF ) ( 34 ) . Currently , the study of how lost cells replenish from progenitor cells has become a 60 trendy field in lung biology . However , the mechanisms of membrane repair at molecular and cellular levels are 61 underappreciated and understudied in pulmonary diseases . Here we attempt to summarize relevant literatures 62 revealing the mechanisms of lung cell wounding and repair with a focus on biophysical injury mechanisms and 63 discuss the therapeutic perspectives of targeting lung cell repair for the treatment of ARDS and IPF . 64 Two devastating lung injurious diseases ARDS and IPF 65 ARDS and IPF are two distressing pulmonary diseases where cell and tissue injury may be part of their possible 66 etiology . ARDS is a syndrome associated with diffuse alveolar damage , severe hypoxemia , non - cardiogenic 67 pulmonary edema and bilateral pulmonary infiltrate ( 233 ) . The 2012 Berlin definition ( 74 ) replaced the original 68 American - European Consensus Conference definition of acute lung injury and ARDS ( 22 ) , and categorized both 69 acute lung injury and ARDS into mild , moderate and severe ARDS based on the level of hypoxemia . ARDS has a 70 reported incidence of 86 per 100 , 000 people per year and there are approximately 190 , 000 cases of ARDS in the 71 U . S . ( 220 ) . Despite the enormous efforts to improve and develop new therapeutics for the treatment of ARDS based 72 on emerging knowledge on the pathogenic mechanisms of ARDS , most clinical trials failed with the exception 73 that low tidal volume ventilation therapy showed benefits on early and late mortality ( 1 , 39 ) . In addition , early 74 application of prolonged prone positioning ( 89 ) , or neuromuscular blocker cisatracurium besylate ( 201 ) , was also 75 reported to reduce 28 day and 60 day mortality of the ARDS patients . As a result , the mortality rate for ARDS is 76 4 still as high as 21 % ~ 58 % ( 12 ) and significant comorbidities occur among survivors ( 93 , 180 ) . Thus , new therapeutic 77 target ( s ) covering broad pathology in ARDS is in high demand . 78 IPF is the most common form of idiopathic interstitial lung disease that causes lung tissue damage and 79 scarring ( 240 ) . It is characterized by progressive loss of respiratory lobules due to fibrosis and remodelling of 80 alveolar units , manifested as the decline of pulmonary function in the clinic ( 57 ) . IPF affects approximately 500 , 000 81 patients in Europe and the U . S . ( 54 ) , and is the most fatal fibrotic disease since it only has a median survival of 3 - 5 82 years after diagnosis . There were no treatments for IPF until the recent FDA approval of two drugs , i . e . 83 Pirfenidone ( 129 ) and Nintedanib ( 213 ) . Significantly , Pirfenidone reduced the percentage of patients with disease 84 progression from 31 . 8 % to 16 . 5 % , and increased the percentage of patients with stable pulmonary function from 85 9 . 7 % to 22 . 7 % at 52 - weeks of treatment . The all - cause mortality rate of patients was also reduced from 7 . 2 % to 86 4 % . Similarly , Nintedanib reduced pulmonary function decline by about 39 % but there was no significant 87 improvement on mortality rate . Despite that this great breakthrough ended the era of no treatment for IPF , the fact 88 that these two drugs only slow down disease progression in some patients warrants further development of 89 combinational therapies for the treatment of IPF . 90 Experimental evidences of lung cell injury in ARDS and IPF 91 Adult lung epithelial cells have relatively low cell turnover rate and facultative post - injury regeneration 92 capacity ( 134 ) . Its main physiological function of gas exchange is fulfilled by a specialized structure , i . e . the blood - 93 gas barrier , that is composed of a thin layer of basal membrane ( ~ 0 . 3 Ȧ ) and three types of cells , the thin and flat 94 type I alveolar epithelial cells ( ATI ) covering 90 % of the alveolar lining surface , the corner - residing cuboidal type 95 II alveolar epithelial cells ( ATII ) producing surfactant , and the endothelial cells lining the microvasculature wall . 96 Interstitium is the space between endothelium and alveolar basement membrane at the vascular side where 97 interstitial fibroblasts and macrophages reside . Although alveolar epithelial cells have membrane lipid folds that 98 may partially mitigate the likelihood of cell breakage ( 258 ) at non - injurious lung volume changes , or fix small 99 disruptions at the plasma membrane ( 51 ) , cell stress failures do occur at high lung parenchymal strains ( 53 , 75 , 76 ) or 100 when exposed to excessive biotoxins . As a result , alveolar epithelial and endothelial cells are wounded and 101 consequently trigger cell death ( 152 ) without effective repairs . In addition , the plasma membrane bilayer is highly 102 susceptible to injury by free radicals , so various internal and external oxidizing insults ( 97 , 105 , 224 , 290 ) such as 103 radiation , ischemic reperfusion , hyperoxia , ozone and heavy metals etc . cause compromised membrane integrity 104 and cell death partially through increasing oxidative stresses . 105 Studies have shown that epithelial and endothelial cell wounding occurs upon physical stresses to the lung ( 53 , 101 ) . 106 For example , Costello ML et al . applied high hydrostatic pressure to lungs of rabbits , and membrane porations 107 and breakages affecting alveolar epithelial cells and endothelial cells were captured on transmission EM ( 53 , 64 , 90 ) . 108 Hall SM et al . showed that alveolar cell blebbing occurs during reperfusion of transplanted rat lungs by EM ( 90 ) . 109 Furthermore , studies by Gajic O et al . ( 76 ) and Kim SC et al . ( 127 ) demonstrated reversible and irreversible forms of 110 alveolar cell membrane stress failure in situ following stretch injury on optical lung slices . It is worth noting that 111 mechanical stresses not only cause compromised cell integrity , but also altered cellular architecture . For example , 112 Dreyfuss D et al . ( 62 ) caught endothelial blebs , and detachment from the basement membrane , following 5 - 10 min 113 of short ventilation with 45 cm H 2 O peak airway pressure in rats . In addition , early studies by Egan EA et al . ( 65 , 66 ) 114 showed that mechanical stress caused an increase in alveolar permeability , likely due to perturbation of 115 intercellular tight - junction and alveolar - capillary barrier structures in endothelial cells ( 38 ) . These structure 116 perturbations all directly and indirectly contribute to the conventional injurious manifestations of the lung such as 117 histological alteration , lung edema , and levels of protein and lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) etc . in bronchoalveolar 118 lavage fluid ( BALF ) . 119 In injurious pulmonary diseases , cell death may occur through apoptosis , necrosis , necroptosis and other 120 undefined mechanism ( s ) , following plasma membrane injury . In ARDS , cell necrosis may be a direct 121 consequence of bacteria toxin ( 185 ) and mechanical stress ( 127 , 206 ) . Morphological characteristics of apoptosis ( 13 ) 122 5 and DNA fragmentation ( 17 ) were also detected in alveolar epithelial cells of the ARDS patients . Ligands of the 123 apoptotic pathway were shown to accumulate in edema fluid and lung tissues ( 4 ) , as well as BALF of the ARDS 124 patients ( 174 ) . Complicating factors often contribute to the extent of cell death in ARDS . For example , increased 125 lung cell apoptosis was found under injurious mechanical ventilation in conjunction with hyperoxia ( 28 ) or 126 hypoxia ( 137 ) , suggesting that a cascade of cell injury and cell death may contribute to the loss of pulmonary 127 function in ARDS . Necrosis is featured by plasma membrane disruption and release of intracellular components , 128 including endogenous “danger” signal molecules which cause immune responses and pathological changes ( 78 ) . 129 Delayed clearance of apoptotic cells may induce secondary necrosis with their intracellular contents released to 130 induce subsequent immune responses , so the maintenance of cell membrane integrity is crucial for avoiding 131 undesired immunity ( 170 , 204 ) . Furthermore , repeated micro - injury to alveolar cells is viewed as an etiological factor 132 for pulmonary fibrosis ( 23 , 226 ) , which causes epithelial cell loss on one hand and stimulates uncontrolled fibroblast 133 proliferation on the other hand . For example , changes in function and morphology of alveolar epithelial cells were 134 consistent features of early phase pulmonary fibrosis in human patients ( 43 , 123 ) , and many studies ( 16 , 140 , 205 ) detected 135 apoptotic markers at proximal and distal epithelial cells of the IPF lung samples . As detailed in the section below , 136 chronic epithelial cell injury and abnormal repair may be the initiating factor to stimulate mesenchymal cell 137 proliferation of fibrogenesis , eventually leading to IPF . 138 Pathogenic mechanisms of cell wounding in ARDS and IPF 139 The pathophysiological hallmarks of ARDS are diffuse alveolar damage , surfactant dysfunction and activation of 140 inflammatory responses ( 289 ) . Injury to pulmonary epithelial and endothelial cells was recognized as a contributing 141 factor for the pathogenesis of ARDS ( 59 , 199 ) , particularly when mechanical ventilation is used ( 53 ) . Progressive lung 142 cell injury and cell death in ARDS are likely initiated from heterogeneity in lung parenchymal stiffness ( 216 , 242 ) 143 resulting from local surfactant inactivation and inflammation , leading to regional acinar overdistention . 144 Overdistension causes vascular leakiness by breaking or remodelling tight junctions . The resulting alveolar edema 145 further inactivates surfactant , which in turn contributes to epithelial injury by interfacial stress , starting a vicious 146 cycle of progressive lung injury . In many cases , fibrin and collagen deposition originated from denuded basement 147 membrane may serve as the sites of fibrotic signalling cascades for the future development of pulmonary 148 fibrosis ( 272 ) . 149 On the other hand , although the exact causes for IPF remain elusive and its pathogenesis incompletely understood , 150 a hallmark of this disease is recurrent or persistent alveolar epithelial injury and epithelial cell apoptosis ( 16 , 140 , 205 ) . 151 Prolonged cell injury in conjunction with aberrant epithelial cell repair stimulate fibrogenesis of mesenchymal 152 cells through inappropriate epithelium and mesenchyme crosstalk , while mesenchymal - like cells may also 153 feedback on epithelial cells to promote epithelial - mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) ( 120 ) , forming a self - amplifying 154 loop of progressive fibrosis ( 57 ) . Furthermore , it is hypothesized that sudden increases in epithelial injury may be 155 one of the underlying causes for acute exacerbation of IPF ( 119 ) . The injurious insults associated with IPF are 156 thought to be diverse in nature . In addition to well - recognized genetic factors for IPF susceptibility ( 139 ) , many 157 biological factors and environmental exposures such as virus infection , gastroesophageal reflux , radiation , 158 cigarette smoke , exposure to dusts , fumes or chemicals had been reported to be risk factors for IPF ( 18 , 80 ) . 159 Prolonged mechanical ventilation may also lead to development of local fibrotic changes in the lung ( 256 ) . In the 160 following section , we will elaborate on the biophysical , inflammatory and environmental mechanisms through 161 which each of the above pathogenic factors injures lung cells , and thus contributes to the development of ARDS 162 and IPF ( Figure 1 ) . It is important to remember that these pathogenic factors are interdependent of each other . 163 Surfactant dysfunction Surfactant is a lipoprotein complex that reduces surface tension and assists with innate 164 host defence of the lung ( 255 ) . It is composed of ~ 90 % lipids and ~ 10 % surfactant - associated proteins ( SPs ) 165 including SP - A , B , C and D . SPs are mainly produced by ATII cells , and surfactant dysfunction is viewed as an 166 important contributing factor in the complex pathophysiology of ARDS and IPF . Indeed , various pathological 167 changes occurred during ARDS and IPF , e . g . , plasma proteins in extravasated edema fluid , proteolytic enzymes 168 from recruited immune cells or free oxygen radicals can all inactivate surfactant in the airspace ( 217 ) . In addition , 169 6 study suggests that surfactant dysfunction can be induced by transforming growth factor ( TGF ) β over - expression 170 prior to the presence of profibrotic lung remodelling ( 159 ) . Mechanical ventilation has also been shown to alter the 171 organization and function of surfactant complex ( 255 ) . 172 The overall biophysical consequence of surfactant dysfunction is heterogeneous compliance at local lung regions , 173 in conjunction with the loss of lung unit due to local edema , which causes lung cell injury as described below . In 174 addition , it was shown that surfactant dysfunction contributes to alveolar epithelial cell apoptosis ( 73 ) through 175 upregulation of endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) stress ( 139 ) as detailed in a later section . Surfactant has also been 176 shown to have a protective effect on the barrier function ( 136 ) , and thus surfactant dysfunction may aggravate 177 severity of lung edema and inflammatory cell infiltration . Furthermore , as a previous report showed that loss of 178 SP - D may enhance sensitivity of the lung to hyperoxia - , ozone - and bleomycin - induced injury through inhibiting 179 inducible nitric oxide synthase - mediated reactive nitrogen species production ( 171 ) , it is reasonable that surfactant 180 dysfunction may substantially increase susceptibility of lung cells to injurious stimuli . Interestingly , large 181 genome - wide sequencing studies identified an association between mutations in SFTPC and SFTPA2 , the gene 182 encoding SPs C and A2 , and familial IPF ( 139 ) , which accounted for up to 20 % of IPF cases ( 139 ) . Nevertheless , lack 183 of functional surfactant alone doesn’t recapitulate the fibrotic changes of IPF , but rather aggravates bleomycin - 184 induced lung pathology in mouse models ( 9 , 144 ) , supporting that surfactant dysfunction is mainly a disease modifier 185 rather than a direct cause of IPF . 186 Over - distension and interfacial stress It is known that biophysical mechanisms alone can cause 187 physiologically significant cellular injury in the lung . Approximately 19 % of mechanically ventilated patients 188 develop de novo ARDS ( 114 ) . In addition , in absence of previous lung injuries , mechanical ventilation could induce 189 lung pathologies in animal models that are similar to those observed in ARDS patients ( 277 ) . Indeed , a decline in 190 hospital - acquired ARDS was reported since the introduction of lower tidal volume ventilation strategy . Recently , 191 it was also demonstrated that even spontaneous breathing with increased tidal volumes , particularly when 192 associated with mechanical ventilation , could injure normal lungs as well as exacerbate edema and inflammation 193 in diseased lungs ( 27 ) . The biophysical mechanisms of lung cell injury , in particular over - distension and interfacial 194 stress , in disease states such as ARDS and IPF , can be summarized as follows . While both biophysical 195 mechanisms contribute to the pathogenesis of ARDS ( 242 ) , we speculate that over - distension - induced lung injury 196 may be more relevant for IPF due to lack of pulmonary edema secondary to poor blood circulation in scarred lung 197 tissues . 198 In the uninjured lung , alveolar walls more or less unfold and refold during normal breathing . Neither epithelial 199 nor endothelial cells undergo large elastic deformations as alveolar surface area changes under this condition . 200 Only at lung volumes approaching total lung capacity are alveolar walls and adherent cells stretched to a 201 significant degree , leading to an increase in tensile stress on cell - cell junctions . However , the above elastic 202 buffering capacity of lung parenchyma is greatly reduced in fibrotic lungs , rendering susceptibility to tensile 203 stress . If tidal volumes remain substantially elevated for extended periods of time , this tensile stress triggers the 204 remodelling or frank breakage of cell - cell junctions , which in turn is associated with an increase in paracellular 205 and possibly transcellular fluid flux ( over - distension - induced lung injury ) . In ARDS , the egress of proteinaceous 206 fluid into the alveolar space in conjunction with large alveolar area oscillations impairs surfactant function and 207 thereby raises local surface tension . An increase in alveolar surface tension represents a collapse force , which 208 decreases lung compliance . Similar changes in lung compliance occur in IPF lungs largely due to surfactant 209 dysfunction and lung scarring . Increased alveolar surface tension further stresses the cell and tissue attachments at 210 the boundary of the collapsing lung segments , and augments the hydrostatic pressure gradient favouring cell 211 injury and alveolar flooding . As long as the fluid in the airspace remains liquid ( in contrast to an organized semi - 212 solid ) , breathing will cause the agitation and movement of air / liquid interfaces along small airways and airspaces . 213 In vitro micro - channel experiments have shown that the stresses associated with such movements are large 214 enough to deform adjacent epithelial cells and cause plasma membrane bleb formation and bleb rupture ( 200 ) 215 ( interfacial stress ) . Moreover , the agitation of alveolar exudate during breathing and thus mixing of gas and fluid 216 in the presence of surfactant favours the formation of foam . Foam is unstable and releases energy during foam 217 7 fracture , which again if sufficiently large would wound adjacent cells ( 83 ) ( again , interfacial stress ) . It should be 218 emphasized that when presented , surfactant dysfunction , alveolar over - distension , small scale heterogeneity of the 219 lung mechanical properties as well as the cyclic recruitment and derecruitment of lung unit , are interdependent 220 rather than distinct and independent biophysical injury mechanisms ( 242 ) . The ARDS lung is particularly vulnerable 221 to all above biophysical injury mechanisms , because impaired barrier properties are one of the hallmarks of the 222 syndrome . Moreover , the need to support gas exchange through oxygen supplementation ( 121 ) and to support 223 ventilation by mechanical means ( 114 ) increases the risk of iatrogenic lung insults . 224 Proinflammatory cytokines Proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor α ( TNFα ) , IL1 , IL - 6 , and IL - 8 225 levels were detected in BALF from early and late stage ARDS patients ( 178 ) . In addition , IL - 17A and IL - 1β were 226 elevated in BALF of IPF patients ( 276 ) , while expression of interleukin ( IL ) 17A and interferon γ were found in 227 lungs of bleomycin - injected mice . Proinflammatory cytokines often turn on downstream signalling pathways that 228 either produce membrane - injury products or cause compromised plasma membrane integrity as part of the cell 229 death mechanism . For example , TNF can mediate cell injury and death through well - known and newly emerging 230 mechanisms . Typically , TNF binds to either TNF receptor ( TNFR ) 1 or TNFR2 , and activates nuclear factor - κB 231 ( NF - κB ) , Jun amino - terminal kinases or p38 mitogen - activated protein kinases to escalate inflammatory 232 responses ( 265 ) and produce mediators with high plasma membrane and systemic toxicity such as reactive oxygen 233 species ( ROS ) and reactive nitrogen species ( 24 ) . If NF - κB activation is inhibited by cytosolic factors , binding of 234 TNF to TNFR1 may also trigger cell death pathways ( 91 ) through apoptosis in cells with low levels of receptor - 235 interacting protein ( RIP ) 3 or necroptosis in cells with a sufficient amount of RIP3 ( 91 ) , the latter being a particular 236 type of cell death mode characterized by cytoplasm granulation , cell swelling and loss of plasma membrane 237 integrity ( 189 ) . Furthermore , proinflammatory chemokines attract immune cells including neutrophils to infiltrate 238 the lung , and persistent neutrophil inflammation is an important indicator of tissue injury ( 77 ) and multi - organ 239 failure in ARDS ( 172 ) , as sequestered neutrophils may injure epithelial and endothelial layers through degranulation , 240 oxidative burst and extracellular traps ( 275 ) . Indeed , neutrophils transmigration across lung epithelial cell monolayer 241 causes a denudation type of “wound” ( 288 ) , while inhibition of CXC / C - X - C chemokine receptor 2 interaction 242 significantly reduced neutrophil sequestration and lung injury in mice following injurious ventilation ( 21 ) . Increased 243 neutrophil levels in IPF lungs ( 128 ) were also shown to correlate with an alveolar epithelial injury marker 244 Cytokeratin 19 ( 109 ) as well as early mortality of IPF patients ( 128 ) , and neutrophil elastase inhibitor ameliorated 245 bleomycin - induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice ( 245 ) . 246 On the other hand , cell injury and cell death in ARDS and IPF are capable of stimulating immune responses and 247 hence production of more proinflammatory cytokines . Slutsky SA put forward the notion of “biotrauma” based on 248 their experimental findings that mechanical ventilation causes release of proinflammatory mediators of the innate 249 immunity into the airspace ( 232 , 249 ) , and Andrews N . W . hypothesizes that prolonged injury may provide both the 250 primary antigens and immune adjuvants to sufficiently activate the adaptive immunity ( 8 ) . Although apoptosis 251 largely maintains cell membrane integrity , delayed clearance of apoptotic cells may induce secondary necrosis 252 with the release of intracellular contents to stimulate immune response ( 170 , 204 ) . Necrosis is featured by plasma 253 membrane disruption , and release of intracellular components including endogenous “danger” signal molecules 254 elicits immune responses and pathological changes ( 78 ) . Similar to necrosis , necroptotic cells swell and rupture , 255 leading to the release of damage - associated molecular patterns ( 79 ) . 256 Bacterial toxins Nearly all types of bacteria produce pore - forming toxins ( PFTs ) , which cause damage to a 257 plasma membrane by direct pore formation . Bacterial pneumonia and sepsis are the leading cause and frequent 258 complication of ARDS ( 63 ) . Cell lysis by PFTs may be an important pathogenic mechanism for epithelial and 259 endothelial barrier disruption and infection spreading in ARDS of infectious origins ( 106 , 161 ) . In addition , evidence 260 showed that bacterial infection may be a mortality risk ( 99 ) and treatment by antibiotic septrin led to a reduction in 261 infections and mortality in IPF ( 230 ) . Bacteria , including Haemophilus , Streptococcus and Pseudomonas were also 262 isolated from BALF culture of IPF patients ( 214 ) . Thus direct cell injury by bacterial products are not to be 263 overlooked in injurious pulmonary diseases . 264 8 PFTs account for 25 ~ 30 % cytotoxic bacterial products ( 106 ) , which are often utilized by bacteria as virulent factors 265 and drug - resistant mechanisms ( 106 ) . PFTs are capable of recognizing host plasma membrane components , inserting 266 into plasma membranes and forming stable pores of 2 ~ 40 nm in size ( 236 ) . Take a few common pulmonary 267 pathogens as examples , the gram positive cocci Staphylococcus aureus produce α - toxin , which has been shown to 268 create small pores of ~ 2 nm in diameter on host plasma membrane that are not permeable to Ca 2 + ( 100 ) . 269 Consequently , host cells likely utilize Ca 2 + - independent endocytic and exosomal shedding mechanisms to close 270 these pores in a slow process ( 6 h or more ) for cell survival ( 100 ) . Studies showed that Rab - 5 and Rab - 11 may be 271 key regulators of the Ca 2 + - independent removal of bacterial pores ( 160 ) . Streptococcus pyogenes is another gram 272 positive cocci that secretes PFT streptolysin O ( SLO ) . While creating much larger pores on host membranes than 273 α - toxin ( ~ 40 nm ) , cells mainly use rapid ( within minutes ) Ca 2 + - dependent mechanisms to remove SLO pores ( 52 , 274 250 ) . As described in a later section , caveolar endocytosis was shown to be critically important for repairing SLO 275 perforation on cultured cells ( 51 ) , while another study found that the endosomal sorting complex for transport 276 ( ESCRT ) machinery was required for Ca 2 + - dependent exosomal shedding of SLO pores ( 116 ) . Pseudomonas 277 aeruginosa ( P . aeruginosa ) are opportunistic gram negative rods causing severe lung infections in 278 immunocompromised patients ( 222 ) . P . aeruginosa secretes PFTs that create 3 . 5 ~ 8 nm pores on host cell 279 membranes ( 56 , 231 ) , which was used as a type III secretion system for injection of other injurious cytotoxins into the 280 host cells ( 222 , 223 ) . Notably , ExoU , a cytotoxin injected through this system , disrupts lipid metabolism and 281 membrane integrity of the targeted lung epithelial cells and macrophages ( 222 ) . Thus , P . aeruginosa strains 282 possessing ExoU such as PA103 , often cause wide - spread systemic infection and high mortality of hosts ( 5 , 70 ) . 283 Another common gram positive rod , Bacillus anthracis produces a lethal toxin that destroys lung epithelial barrier 284 function and interferes with injury repair by immobilizing the actin and microtubule network ( 147 ) . In addition to 285 direct injury to host cells , PFTs also induce cell death secondary to K + efflux , Ca 2 + influx , ATP depletion , 286 mitochondrial damage and cell swelling ( 125 ) . PFTs of certain bacteria are also capable of triggering necroptosis , 287 the regulated form of necrosis ( 189 ) . For example , RIP Kinase 3 - mediated necroptosis of macrophages was activated 288 by PFTs from pulmonary pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus ( 130 ) , Streptococcus pneumonia and Serratia 289 marcescens ( 87 ) , while inhibition of necroptosis regulators improved the outcome of pneumonia in animal 290 models ( 87 ) . 291 Viral infections Certain types of community viral pneumonia may evolve into ARDS ( 167 ) , notably influenza 292 viruses H5N1 and H1N1 , and coronavirus that caused a severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic in 2003 . 293 Nosocomial herpesviridae ( HV ) infections causing viral pneumonia can similarly evolve into ARDS ( 167 ) . H5N1 294 was also used to create an ARDS model in mice ( 281 ) . With regard to infectious predispositions for IPF , more 295 association studies have pointed to a viral source rather than a bacterial source , e . g . human HV were often 296 detected in serum , BALF or biopsy of IPF but not non - IPF patients ( 124 , 173 , 238 ) . HV infection worsened fibrosis in 297 animals administered with fibrogenic agents such as bleomycin or fluorescein isothiocyanate , although viral 298 infection alone did not trigger fibrosis in young adult mice ( 158 , 188 , 239 ) , supporting the hypothesis that HV infection , 299 latent or activated , serves as a “second hit” for developing fibrotic changes in the lung ( 138 ) . Nevertheless , 300 combination of HV infection and aging did trigger fibrotic changes in experimental mice ( 193 ) , implying that IPF is 301 a nonspecific injurious disease , and that a repair threshold of the lung had been overwhelmed by a combination of 302 injurious insults . As most viruses enter the host cells via regulated endocytosis ( 197 ) , plasma membrane integrity of 303 the host cell is usually preserved during viral infections . However , surfactant dysfunction , ER stress and cell death 304 are common consequences of viral infections , which are all attributing factors for plasma membrane damage and 305 cell injury in IPF ( 110 , 143 ) . In addition , virus infection triggers cytokine and chemokine release from activated innate 306 and adaptive immune cells including neutrophil - attracting chemokines ( 11 ) . As a result , proinflammatory cytokines 307 and tissue - infiltrated neutrophils cause lung injury following viral infections . As elaborated above , injured cells in 308 turn release danger signals such as uric acid , and activate the inflammasome ( 81 ) , further promoting inflammatory 309 responses and aggravating lung injury . 310 Cigarette smoking Among environmental risk factors for pulmonary diseases , cigarette smoking is a main one . 311 Study by Ekstrom M et al . showed that cumulative exposure to smoke led to increased risk for IPF , and disease 312 severity was linearly associated with the dose of exposure ( 67 ) . In addition , male gender and occupational exposures 313 9 ( including fibres , fumes , gas , mineral dust , organic dust and vapours ) , two other risk factors for IPF , had 314 synergistic effects with cigarette smoking ( 67 ) . Furthermore , introduction of tobacco exposure biomarker rather 315 than solely relying on smoking history provided more definitive proof for the link between smoking exposures 316 and development of ARDS ( 33 ) . Cigarette smoking causes a collection of pathophysiological changes such as 317 inducing profibrotic gene expression , weakening of the immune system and stimulating proinflammatory 318 responses ( 41 , 47 , 184 ) . Existing data showed that smoking can increase permeability of alveolar epithelial cells ( 118 ) 319 and that of the endothelium ( 95 , 225 ) , and such action was largely attributed to ROS production ( 42 ) . Specifically , ROS 320 is capable of interacting with plasma membrane lipids and protein moieties and was shown to increase “leaking” 321 of the plasma membrane directly ( 235 ) . Thus , the oxidative agent H 2 O 2 is often used as a reagent to induce 322 nonspecific cell injury via oxidative stress . In addition , ROS can also activate the unfolded protein response ( UPR ) 323 and induce ER stress and ultimately apoptosis in lung cells ( 126 , 264 ) . Indeed , anti - oxidants had been a long term 324 interest for developing new therapies against IPF until the recent clinical trials on acetylcysteine failed to show 325 any significant benefits on lung function among IPF patients ( 107 ) , possibly because that ROS - induced lung cell 326 injury may only be relevant for a small portion of IPF cases . 327 Gastric acid aspiration Gastric acid aspiration is a common complication of general anaesthesia or among 328 unconscious trauma or ICU patients . It is recognized as a direct cause and an independent risk factor for 329 ARDS ( 208 ) . In addition , multivariate analysis also identified that gastroesophageal reflux is associated with a 330 higher risk for IPF ( 209 , 248 ) . Interestingly , acid aspiration has also been linked to acute exacerbation of IPF ( 48 ) , 331 highlighting the importance of injurious factors in the disease state of IPF . The injurious effects of acid on lung 332 epithelium are physical and can be a direct effect of protons to some extent ( 274 ) . Studies showed that contact with 333 concentrated acid cause membrane pore formation in alveolar epithelial cells , and this transient poration 334 sufficiently induced an unusual and transitory proinflammatory response of the alveolar epithelium through 335 mediating Ca 2 + entry and NADPH oxidase 2 - dependent H 2 O 2 release ( 274 ) . In addition , acid aspiration may also 336 work in concert with lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) to disrupt barrier function and alter lung mechanics ( 247 ) . Low pH of 337 other origins was shown to similarly injure the lung cells . Doerr CH et al . showed that hypercapnic acidosis 338 significantly increased the percentage of cell wounding in ventilated lungs ( 58 ) and buffering hypercapnic acidosis 339 to neutral pH rescued cell wounding ( 37 ) , supporting the direct cell lytic effect of protons . To this end , although the 340 cell mending effect of hypercapnic acidosis inspired many studies to explore its therapeutic role for ARDS in vivo , 341 the whole body effects of hypercapnic acidosis are more complex and somewhat contradictory , precluding its 342 possible clinical application ( 55 ) . Lastly , other gastric contents may also play a role in lung cell injury . Felder M et 343 al . fabricated a microfluidic channel device for exposing A549 cells to acidified pepsin containing solution , and 344 their results found that while low pH alone can alter cell morphology , additional pepsin was required to cause cell 345 monolayer disruption , suggesting that multiple erosive factors in the gastric content and weakened barrier 346 mechanisms contributed to lung epithelial wounding much like the formation of gastric ulcers ( 68 ) . 347 State of the art and perspective In this section , we described clinically identified risk factors for ARDS and IPF , 348 and summarized current knowledge on the biophysical mechanisms through which they eventually cause plasma 349 membrane damage and cell death . We aim to collect a holistic view of these injurious stimuli under the premise 350 that cell wounding and repair is critically important for the pathogenesis and possibly prognosis of both ARDS 351 and IPF , with the ultimate goal of developing a versatile adjuvant therapy targeting cell injury . Under that premise , 352 perhaps the current experimental models of ARDS and IPF using a single or two injurious stimuli such as 353 ventilation , acid aspiration , or bleomycin injection can be replaced with a model of unified cell wounding . This 354 would be ideal to reduce the vast amount of variations inherent within these models . However , before that , 355 comparison of the extent and characterization of cell wounding following different injurious stimuli need to be 356 done . In addition , the distribution of cell wounding and injured cell types in the lung would determine disease 357 symptoms and pathology severity . It is known that the base of the lung experiences more strain in a standing 358 individual . Coincidentally , IPF has characteristic lesion distribution at the base of the lung . Thus , it would be very 359 interesting to study how regional strain distribution , or accessibility of injurious stimuli , correlates with cell 360 wounding in the lung . Lastly , it is intriguing why in most cases cell wounding resolves well , as in ARDS , but 361 10 others go on to develop fibrotic diseases . As the current theory is that repetitive injury makes the difference , 362 knowledge on the threshold of injury severity and length to trigger unresolvable fibrosis is of great value . 363 Repair mechanisms for injured lung cells 364 In response to a variety of insults as discussed above , cells engage repair mechanisms to rapidly restore 365 membrane integrity and prevent apoptosis , necrosis or necroptosis ( 240 , 258 ) . Indeed , defects in membrane repair 366 have been shown to be involved in a number of human diseases , including muscular dystrophy , cardiovascular 367 diseases and neuronal injury ( 49 ) . The membrane repair process is important for maintaining lung cell function as 368 well as alveolar architecture ( 210 ) . Indeed , ultrastructure microscopy captured gradual restoration of repaired 369 pulmonary vasculature structure following ischemic and reperfusion injury ( 182 ) . Lung cell regeneration has been an 370 intensive area of research for ARDS and IPF in the recent years . Despite studies demonstrating that ATI cells are 371 capable of proliferating in vitro ( 267 ) , and a defined population of them can self - renew in vivo ( 111 ) , full 372 replenishment of permanently injured ATI cells also rely on activation of other lung progenitor cells . Although a 373 number of heterogeneous populations of multipotent cells and progenitors have been identified in the lung ( 253 ) , 374 their intrinsic regeneration ability does not seem to meet the demands of excessive and progressive cell loss in 375 ARDS and IPF . Furthermore , the harsh airspace environment in diseased lungs such as the presence of persistent 376 injurious factors , excessive inflammation and low oxygenation greatly inhibits cell repair by proliferation ( 145 ) . 377 Thus , membrane repair mechanisms to rescue the fate of mildly injured cells are necessities for normal function of 378 the lung . Previous studies indicated that lung cells engage plasma membrane repair in a similar manner 379 comparable to cells in other tissue , such as those in striated muscle and kidney ( 127 , 192 , 267 ) . Here we will discuss a 380 few of these repair mechanisms that had been studies for lung cell repair ( Figure 2 ) , it is important to understand 381 these repair steps work in an orchestrated fashion to collaboratively rescue the falling fate of a cell . 382 Ca 2 + in epithelial cell repair As described above , generally thermodynamic lateral flow of the lipid bilayer is 383 sufficient to reseal small membrane disruptions in cells , likely in a Ca 2 + - independent process ( 160 ) . When larger 384 plasma membrane disruption occurs , three principle steps are engaged to repair the membrane wound . First , the 385 cell senses disruption at the plasma membrane and locates the wound . Second , the plasma membrane signals to 386 mobilize endomembrane lipid vesicles and translocate to the injury site . Third , endocytosis or exocytosis is 387 engaged to remove membrane pores formed by bacterial toxins or large irregular membrane wounds that are hard 388 to patch . Fourth , repair vesicles fuse together with the plasma membrane wound edges to form a repair patch at 389 the injury site . Ca 2 + had been shown to be a key component for overall repair success and for the implementation 390 of the above processes including fusion of lipid vesicles , vesicle translocation to wound sites and removal of 391 membrane pores ( 175 , 246 ) . Consistently , a few essential membrane repair proteins discovered in muscle cells possess 392 Ca 2 + - binding domain and translocate to membrane injury sites in a Ca 2 + - dependent manner including dysferlin , 393 synaptotagmin and annexin etc . , which was described in detail in the comprehensive reviews by Blazek AD et 394 al . ( 25 ) and Cooper ST et al . ( 49 ) . Although only scarce experimental evidence showed that extracellular Ca 2 + plays a 395 role in repair of lung cells ( 181 , 229 ) , we argue that the importance of Ca 2 + in membrane repair is applicable to lung 396 cells as well , since key repair steps are shared among different cell types . 397 Lipid trafficking In lung cells , stretching induces lipid trafficking to and from the plasma membrane in a 398 process termed deformation - induced lipid trafficking ( DILT ) ( 179 , 259 ) . Studies using immortalized lung cell lines 399 and primary alveolar epithelial cells showed that this dynamic lipid trafficking is essential for both injury 400 prevention by membrane unfolding and injury repair by membrane patching ( 71 , 85 , 260 , 269 ) . Vlahakis NE et al . 401 showed that stretching of human alveolar epithelial cell line A549 at 25 % strain triggers a significant increase in 402 cell surface area and incorporation of intracellular lipid vesicles into the existing plasma membrane as a 403 cytoprotective mechanism ( 260 ) . In addition , low temperature and cholesterol depletion , two perturbations that 404 affect plasma membrane fluidity and thus lipid trafficking ( 241 ) , inhibited lipid trafficking to the plasma membrane , 405 and compromised the ability of immortalized and primary lung epithelial cells to repair membrane wounds ( 261 ) . 406 Nevertheless , the injury resistance and repair ability of cell lines and different types of primary lung cells differ 407 substantially ( 141 , 261 ) , suggesting that although the main repair steps may be conserved , differences in dynamics of 408 11 the repair process and / or repair machinery may exist among diverse cell types and injury modes . One question 409 under debate is the exact source of endomembrane contributing to patching of wounded plasma membranes ( 40 , 243 ) . 410 The lysosome is the first suggested source of exocytic vesicles for membrane repair ( 7 , 103 , 112 , 243 ) . However , 411 conflicting results were reported on whether the lysosome fusion inhibitor vacuolin can interfere with membrane 412 repair and Ca 2 + - dependent exocytosis ( 40 , 102 ) , undermining the exclusive role of lysosomes in repair - directed 413 exocytosis . Furthermore , prior studies suggest that endocytosis is also indispensable for successful repair of 414 plasma membrane wounding ( 51 , 108 , 243 ) . Studies in primary ATI cells found that caveolar endocytosis , but not 415 clathrin - mediated or fluid - phase endocytosis , was involved in repairing plasma membrane wounding ( 268 ) . 416 Vaughan EM et al . also pointed out the potential importance of de novo lipid synthesis at the wound site after cell 417 damage through analysis of lipid domain components ( 254 ) . It is worth noting that the exocytosis and endocytosis 418 processes in response to cell injury are not disengaged , as it was shown that injured cells release lysosomal 419 enzyme acid sphingomyelinase in an exocytosis process to promote endocytosis during plasma membrane 420 repair ( 108 , 243 ) . 421 The potential beneficial role of endocytosis inspired an experimental therapy for overdistension - induced lung 422 injury , i . e . , hypertonic saline . Aerosolized hypertonic saline is one of the approved therapies for cystic fibrosis 423 that facilitates mucociliary clearance by restoring the liquid layer lining the airways and promoting anti - infective 424 and anti - inflammatory activities ( 212 ) . It was shown that hypertonic saline could also increase membrane - retrieval 425 response primarily via the caveolar endocytic pathway and thus enhance cellular repair in primary and cultured 426 alveolar epithelial cells ( 269 ) . In addition , other agents capable of modulating lipids had also been tested in models 427 of membrane injury , notably poloxamer 188 ( P188 , also referred as Pluronic F68 ) . P188 is a biocompatible non - 428 ionic amphiphilic copolymer that is able to insert lipid bilayer ( 186 ) and thus increase the plasma membrane lipid 429 reservoir . It was approved by the FDA about 50 years ago as a therapeutic reagent to reduce blood viscosity for 430 transfusions . Studies showed that P188 was effective in improving cell injury and tissue pathology in muscular 431 dystrophy , heart failure , neurodegenerative disorders and electroporation damage to cells ( 186 ) . To our interest , 432 Plataki M et al . reported that P188 can promote alveolar cell repair , rendering cell membranes more resilient to 433 mechanical stress and enhancing cell survival in alveolar resident cells in isolated perfused rat lungs subjected to 434 ventilation injury ( 206 ) . However , this protective effect was not seen in live animals , perhaps reflecting other in vivo 435 injury mechanisms that inhibit cell repair or prolong injury in stress - activated cells . 436 Subcortical cytoskeleton During wounding and repair of plasma membrane wounds , forces like edge energy 437 and adhesive interactions of the lipid bilayer and underlying subcortical cytoskeleton ( CSK ) are balanced at the 438 wound margins . In addition , endocytic and exocytic mechanisms work together and maintain a favourable force 439 balance between edge energy and plasma membrane - cytoskeleton adhesion ( 86 ) . As one of the main components to 440 maintain cell stiffness and support cell structure , CSK is a key player in plasma membrane wounding and 441 repair ( 86 ) . The specific role of the cytoskeleton in wound repair is likely epiphenomena of the complex biology 442 and dependent on the mode of injury . For example , CSK disruption not only leads to a softer cell that renders 443 differential susceptibility to injury by different types of insult , it was also shown to disrupt DILI that is essential 444 for successful cell repair ( 261 ) . In response to stretch injury , a softer cell is less stressed due to the effective release 445 and spreading of applied lateral loads , but the inhibition on DILI by cytochalasin D to depolymerize actin was 446 overwhelming . So , Oeckler RA et al . observed increased cell wounding and reduced cell repair in lung epithelial 447 cells under these conditions ( 261 ) . Nevertheless , the differences in orientation , magnitude , topographical distribution 448 of the stress within the cell as well as duration of the stress would likely also modify the cell’s response to 449 deformation . Therefore , as hypertonic saline also increases CSK and plasma membrane adhesion in addition to 450 stimulating caveolar endocytosis ( 200 ) , it is not surprising that its protective effect would be more effective for 451 stretch - induced lung wounding . On the contrary , as interfacial stress mainly injures the cells by creating local 452 blebs following detachment of plasma membrane from cytoskeleton network ( 200 ) , a softer cell would instead be 453 more susceptible to interfacial stress due to air liquid movements or fracture of liquid bridges . In addition , the role 454 of CSK in cell wounding repair is also dynamic in nature . Specifically , Godin L . M . found that in the first 28 sec 455 after needle wounding of primary ATI cells , actin depolymerisation occurs , followed by a much longer 456 repolymerization and remodelling phase of the actin network ( 86 ) . The initial depolymerisation of the subcortical 457 12 cytoskeleton network is thought to remove the barrier for endomembrane lipid trafficking ( 86 ) while the re - 458 establishment of the actin network is likely for anchoring repair patches and restoring cell morphology . 459 Furthermore , changes in cytoskeletal structure also affect cell attachment to extracellular matrix structure . Yalcin 460 H . C . showed that stabilization of actin improved cell adhesion due to increase in the size and strength of focal 461 adhesions , whereas more detachment is observed in cells with disrupted actin cytoskeletons ( 282 ) . Thus , when 462 evaluating the impact of altered subcortical cytoskeleton on cell wounding and repair , all above mentioned factors 463 need to be integrated and carefully considered . 464 ATP Studies on the contribution of ATP release in wound repair have just started . It is known that ATP is 465 released from contracting muscles , inflamed cells ( 94 ) and wounded cells ( 286 ) . Previous studies showed that non - 466 injurious stretching is sufficient to cause low level ATP release and initiate purinergic signalling in alveolar 467 epithelial cells ( 20 , 88 ) . Belete HA et al . showed that added extracellular ATP could promote plasma membrane 468 repair , while enzymatic removal of extracellular ATP with apyrase inhibited stretch - induced wound repair of 469 alveolar epithelial cells ( 20 ) . Both extracellular ATP and stretching trigger translocalization of LAMP1 to the 470 plasma membrane , indicating endomembrane trafficking and cell repair . ATP signalling transduction to trigger 471 cell repair is dependent on its conventional receptor purinergic receptor P2Y ( P2Y ) 2 ( 19 ) , since silencing of P2Y2 472 receptors inhibited Lysosomal - associated membrane protein 1 ( LAMP1 ) translocalization to the plasma 473 membrane induced by ATP or stretching , as well as repair in A549 , rat lung epithelial cells and primary ATI cells . 474 Nevertheless , the multiple mechanisms that purinergic signal transduction may interact with at large , for example 475 the mechanotransduction pathways , mechanisms that are parallelly activated by stretching , are not clear due to 476 limited availability of relevant studies . Other advantages of ATP release are its ability to impact neighbouring 477 cells via paracrine mechanisms . ATP binding to P2Y2 receptors on neighbouring cells induces protein kinase C - 478 dependent oxidative activation of TNF - α - converting enzyme , which releases membrane - bound ligands of 479 epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) ( 251 ) , and initiates EGFR - dependent cell proliferation and migration ( 251 ) . 480 ATP is also thought to regulate endothelial barrier function . Extracellular ATP produced by inflammation and 481 injured cells could induce a rapid and dose - dependent increase in transendothelial electrical resistance across 482 pulmonary endothelial cells , indicating increased endothelial barrier permeability ( 165 ) . 483 Furthermore , released ATP from stressed cells may be able to turn on certain fibrotic pathways ( 163 , 251 ) and signals 484 conducted by binding of UTP / ATP to P2Y2 receptor , and binding of ADP / UTP / UDP to P2Y6 receptors , were 485 shown to have profibrotic effects ( 69 ) . Recent study showed that although ATP release has no effect on mechanical 486 stretch - induced Ca 2 + influx in human lung fibroblasts ( 191 ) , ATP could release intracellular Ca 2 + through ryanodine 487 channels and increase the expression of profibrotic genes such as TGF - β , collagen A1 and fibronectin ( 113 ) . 488 Therefore , ATP release from stressed cells may be a critical factor that transduces chronic injurious stimuli to 489 fibrotic changes during the pathogenesis of IPF . 490 Tripartite motif - containing protein ( TRIM ) 72 As the subcellular steps of cell repair are largely revealed , 491 investigators spent much effort to identify biologically active protein components that carry out critical functions 492 of each step , such as a wound sensor , a driver for vesicle translocation and patch fusion . Inspirations from 493 neurotransmitter secretion and vesicle fusion had led to the findings of SNAREs , synaptotagmins and ESCRT as 494 repair proteins , and genetic mutations causing repair - defective muscle diseases have propelled the discovery of 495 new membrane repair proteins such as dysferlin , caveolin ( Cav ) 3 , dystrophin and annexins etc . as detailed 496 elsewhere ( 6 , 15 , 25 , 49 , 162 , 175 , 219 ) . In this review , we will highlight the repair molecules that were indicated in the lung . 497 TRIM72 ( also referred to as mitsugumin 53 ) was first identified from skeletal muscle and was thought to be a 498 muscle - specific protein ( 32 ) . TRIM proteins were named for their conserved RING , B - box and coiled - coil domains 499 at the N - terminus , and TRIM72 contains an additional PRY - SPRY domain at its C - terminus . The RING domain 500 of TRIM72 was indicated in E3 ubiquitination of insulin receptor substrate 1 ( 153 , 234 , 285 ) and focal adhesion 501 kinase ( 196 ) , and was therefore involved in the development of insulin resistance and myogenesis . Recent studies 502 reported that TRIM72 was expressed in lung tissue and its presence is broad in lung resident cells including ATI , 503 ATII cells , endothelial cells and alveolar macrophages ( 127 , 192 ) . Kim SC et al . showed that absence of TRIM72 504 increases susceptibility to ventilation - induced lung injury , whereas overexpression via inducible transgenic model 505 13 is protective for ventilation - induced lung cell death ( 127 ) . Specifically , results using fluorescent dyes that separately 506 label non - wounded , wounded but repaired , and necrotic cells showed that ablation of endogenous TRIM72 507 specifically affected the repair process without rendering the primary alveolar epithelial cells to be more resistant 508 to mechanical injury ( 127 ) . During repair of lung cells , a facultative interaction between TRIM72 and Cav1 was 509 shown to be a critical step ( 127 , 192 ) , which will be discussed in the next section . 510 Previous studies showed that TRIM72 preferably localizes at plasma membrane and vesicle complexes close to 511 the membrane , possibly due to its higher affinity to biological membrane component phosphatidylserine ( 32 ) . 512 Disruption of the plasma membrane induces rapid translocation of intracellular TRIM72 to the wounding site and 513 repair of myogenic C2C12 cells . Interestingly , this was not abolished by removal of extracellular Ca 2 + but by 514 scavenging of ROS with dithiothreitol ( 32 ) . Controversially , Howard AC et al . showed that dithiothreitol did not 515 alter dye entry via laser - created wounds in either HeLa or kidney epithelial BSC1 cells , while Vitamin E 516 improved repair of muscle cells in an anti - redox - dependent manner ( 96 ) , suggesting that although the role of 517 TRIM72 in plasma membrane repair is established , the specific trigger ( s ) to mobilize TRIM72 for repair are 518 under debate . It was observed that recombinant TRIM72 tends to polymerize through its cysteine residues under 519 native condition ( 104 ) , and S - nitrosylation of TRIM72 at cysteine 144 was shown to be important for protection of 520 cardiomyocytes from oxidative insults ( 131 , 279 ) . Other studies also reported that nonmuscle myosin type IIA served 521 as a motor to translocate TRIM72 during repair ( 151 ) , and Zn 2 + binding to TRIM72 was important for its repair 522 function ( 31 ) . Furthermore , cholesterol content in the plasma membrane was shown to greatly affect injury - induced 523 membrane translocation of TRIM72 and cell repair in ischemia / reperfusion injury ( 271 ) . Nevertheless , these repair 524 modifiers of TRIM72 are have yet to be verified by other independent studies . 525 Developing a TRIM72 augmentation therapy for the treatment of tissue injurious diseases had been a continuing 526 research area of interest . Recombinant TRIM72 protein was shown to have notably therapeutic effects in mouse 527 models of muscular dystrophy ( 92 , 273 ) , and for ischemic reperfusion injury in muscle and heart ( 50 , 154 , 291 ) . Since 528 striated muscles have the highest levels of endogenous TRIM72 expression in mice , it is not clear why the 529 abundant repair protein is not sufficient to rescue tissue injuries as there were no mutations or polymorphisms of 530 TRIM72 identified so far in tissue injurious diseases . It was reported that human heart tissue had no TRIM72 531 expression unlike the mouse heart ( 148 ) , suggesting species disparities in tissue repair . Curiously , in a recent study 532 by Jia Y et al . ( 115 ) , the authors observed an increase in mean linear intercept measurements ( Lm ) of alveolar spaces 533 in the trim72 - / - lung as compared to the WT lung , and recombinant TRIM72 was able to reduce the increase in 534 end - expiratory lung volume and Lm in mouse models of emphysema . However , Kim SC et al . reported repair 535 defects in primary epithelial cells isolated from trim72 - / - lungs but normal histology under resting conditions ( 127 ) . It 536 is not clear how defective membrane repair affects lung structure and remodelling , so further verification of the 537 observation is needed . 538 Caveolin1 Caveolins are protein components of the plasma membrane invaginations , caveolae ( 218 ) , and play 539 major roles in endocytosis and cell signal transduction ( 203 ) . There are three subtypes of caveolins i . e . , Cav1 , Cav2 540 and Cav3 , while Cav1 is the main type of caveolar protein in ATI cells , fibroblasts and endothelial cells in the 541 lungs . Mutations in Cav3 cause several forms of dystrophic myopathies ( 82 , 183 ) and Cav1 was long thought to be a 542 critical regulator of acute lung injury ( 117 ) . Major histological abnormalities in lung tissue were observed in Cav1 - / - 543 knockout mice ( 61 , 211 ) . Specifically , the alveolar walls of the Cav - / - lung were thicker and filled with extracellular 544 fibrillary deposits , while irregular alveolar space and hypercellularity were observed throughout the lung ( 61 ) . 545 Studies by Corrotte M . et al . ( 51 ) showed that caveolar endocytosis is an indispensable step for the success of 546 plasma membrane repair by removing pores formed by PFTs on the plasma membrane . Previous studies also 547 found that caveolae structures were disturbed during acute kidney injury by oxidative stress , and upregulation of 548 Cav1 was linked to survival of renal cells ( 169 , 287 ) . Using primary ATI cells , Wang S et al . ( 268 ) also showed that 549 caveolar endocytosis , but not the clathrin - and fluid - phase endocytic pathways , was important for repair of lung 550 cells . Their results indicated that hypotonic exposure increased the probability of plasma membrane wound repair 551 through upregulation of caveolar endocytosis in a Src - dependent fashion ( 269 ) . 552 14 Interestingly , previous studies identified a direct physical interaction between TRIM72 and Cav1 ( 127 , 192 ) . The 553 interaction between TRIM72 and Cav1 led to enhanced membrane distribution of Cav1 in co - transfected HEK 554 cells , and primary ATI cells from trim72 - / - lung had reduced membrane localization of Cav1 ( 127 , 192 ) . Through 555 pulse - chase experiments , a significant reduction in caveolar endocytosis was also detected in primary trim72 - / - 556 lung cells as compared to the WT cells , whereas cells overexpressing TRIM72 had increased cargo uptake 557 through caveolar but not the clathrin - and fluid - phase pathways ( 192 ) . In addition , TRIM72 / Cav1 double knockout 558 mice showed increased apoptotic cell death in the lung following over - ventilation as compared to either single 559 knockout alone or the WT lung ( 192 ) . This finding suggests that a direct link between TRIM72 and caveolar 560 endocytosis collaboratively repair wounding of lung epithelial cells . Echoing this observation is the lower repair 561 capacity of ATII cells as compared to ATI cells ( 84 ) where caveolae was lacking but TRIM72 is present ( 127 ) , 562 suggesting that a dual repair protein team is more effective than either alone in lung cell repair . Interestingly , 563 mutagenesis studies found that all four domains of TRIM72 including RING , B - box , coiled - coil and PRY - SPRY , 564 were required for TRIM72 and Cav1 interaction , indicating the conformational nature of this interaction ( 192 ) . 565 State of the art and perspective In this section , we described membrane repair mechanisms that were studied in 566 lung epithelial cells . As this research area is seriously understudied , more detailed investigation is warranted . 567 Generally , the internal and external triggers for a cell to initiate membrane repair , the interaction between repair 568 molecules with persistent presence of injury stimuli , long - term cell fate following successful membrane resealing , 569 and behaviour of neighbouring cells of an injured or repaired cell are interesting areas to study . For lung cell 570 repair , discovering members of the entire repair team , and their spatial and temporal interaction during the repair 571 process are of great interests for latching onto tangible therapeutic targets for the treatment of ARDS and IPF . In 572 addition , preliminary investigation by Godin LM et al . showed that ATIs are more likely to repair PM defects 573 than ATII cells ( 141 ) , while coincidentally ATII cells are historically known to lack Cav1 ( 35 ) . Thus , the repair 574 phenotypes of different types of lung cells that harbour variable repair molecules need to be carefully 575 characterized . Furthermore , determining whether targeting membrane repair effectively reduces the pathology of 576 ARDS and IPF is an integral part of our long - term research interests . 577 Activation of aberrant tissue repair pathways following cell injury 578 Repair of individual cells cannot be taken out of the tissue context . We learned a great deal about tissue healing 579 from repair of wounded skin , which is largely comprised of three stages , the coagulation stage , the granulation 580 stage and the maturation stage ( 135 ) . The coagulation stage serves to stop bleeding , form scaffolding for migrating 581 epithelial cells and nucleate activated growth factor - secreting platelets / macrophages ; the granulation stage is 582 dominated by fibroblast proliferation , angiogenesis and collagen deposition to form scars ; the maturation stage is 583 characterized by debris removal and scar remodelling by macrophages and proteases and retraction of fibroblasts . 584 During normal healing of small wounds , minimal scar tissues are formed due to limited activity and early 585 withdrawal of fibroblasts , while large scale fibroblast activation is usually necessary for repair of large tissue 586 wounds with extensive epithelial destruction . The process of skin wound healing inspired hypotheses to explain 587 the pathogenesis of injurious lung diseases such as ARDS and IPF . As ARDS is often characterized by extensive 588 lung injury , it is conceivable that a percentage of ARDS patients developed fibrosis long after the respiratory 589 distress is relieved ( 30 ) . However , severe lung injury was not evidenced in most IPF cases , but large scale fibroblast 590 activation was often seen ( 57 ) . A prevailing theory for IPF etiology is that repeated or persistent micro - injury of the 591 lung epithelium can also cause overactivation of the profibrotic signalling pathways ( 226 ) , with the aid of re - 592 activation of developmental signalling pathways . As in - depth knowledge on epithelial to mesenchymal crosstalk 593 in IPF has been reviewed previously ( 221 , 227 ) , we will briefly describe a few key signalling pathways that could be 594 induced by epithelial injury as an extension of our cell injury and repair focus ( Figure 3 ) . 595 TGF - β signalling pathway Among many profibrotic mediators , TGF - β is one of the initiating , and most 596 essential fibrogenetic cytokines for the pathogenesis of IPF . TGF - β was secreted as an inactive complex with 597 latency associated peptide ( LAP ) , and tethered to the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) by latent TGF - β binding 598 protein ( 278 ) . Binding of LAP to integrin exposes and activates TGF - β , which binds to TGF - β receptor ( TβR ) I and 599 15 II to turn on transcription of profibrotic genes via phosphorylation of SMAD . Previous studies showed that 600 alveolar epithelial cells serve as a primary source of TGF - β ( 283 ) . In particular , following injury , epithelial cells are 601 induced to contract their subcortical actin - myosin cytoskeletons , applying physical force on latent TGF - β 602 complex and activate TGF - β ( 228 ) . Meanwhile , injurious stimuli also promote the expression of epithelial integrins 603 αvβ 6 ( 228 ) . Neverthless , blocking TGF - β signalling in either epithelial cells or mesenchymal cells attenuated 604 bleomycin induced lung fibrosis . Li M et al . ( 150 ) reported that epithelial specific TβRII deficiency protects the lung 605 from bleomycin induced fibrosis , which is associated with improved epithelial survival and increased fibroblast 606 apoptosis . Recently , Luo Y et al . ( 166 ) reported that blocking TGF - β signalling in lung mesenchymal cells by 607 targeting TβRII with Tbx4 lung enhancer - driven Tet - On system also protected the lung from bleomycin induced 608 fibrosis , mainly through inhibiting TGF - β - induced collagen production . Therefore , both epithelial and 609 mesenchymal TGF - β signalling play important but distinct roles in mediating lung fibrosis . It is worth 610 mentioning that TGF - β alone is not sufficient to promote permanent fibrosis , and TGF - β - induced fibrotic 611 responses are mostly transient and reversible , which was completely recovered within a month once induction of 612 active TGF - β was stopped ( 146 ) . 613 Wnt signalling pathway Wnt is a family of Cysteine - rich , lipid - modified signalling glycoproteins that regulate 614 embryo architecture through coordinating proliferation and differentiation of adjacent cells ( 149 , 262 ) . The Wnt 615 signalling pathway starts with secretion and binding of Wnt ligands to its surface receptor Frizzled on target cells . 616 The canonical Wnt pathway includes binding of co - receptor Lrp5 / 6 , cytosolic stabilization and nuclear 617 translocation of β - catenin , while the non - canonical pathway induces β - catenin - independent signals to trigger 618 expression of target genes ( 168 ) . Under normal development and homeostasis , canonical Wnt signalling is essential 619 for specification , expansion and differentiation of multiple lung epithelial and mesenchymal lineages ( 262 , 266 ) , while 620 non - canonical Wnt signalling controls vascular formation , ECM production , smooth muscle cell proliferation and 621 migration , as well as epithelial cell maintenance and differentiation ( 149 ) . Given the critical role of the Wnt pathway 622 in directing alveolar cell fate ( 44 , 215 , 270 ) , the observed over - activation of both canonical and non - canonical Wnt / β - 623 catenin pathways in IPF ( 3 , 44 , 132 , 195 , 263 ) may reflect an attempt of compensatory response following tissue injury ( 60 ) . 624 However , aberrant Wnt upregulation turns out to be more deleterious than beneficial . First , constitutively Wnt 625 upregulation may inhibit ATII to ATI differentiation and thus prevent proper re - epithelisation of the lung . Second , 626 Wnt / β - catenin activation promotes fibroblast expansion via paracrine mode and thus increases collagen 627 accumulation in the ECM ( 263 ) . Third , Wnt / β - catenin signalling is also a central trigger of EMT , a mechanism 628 providing an additional source of mesenchymal cells in IPF ( 45 , 207 ) . 629 Sonic Hedgehog signalling pathway The Hedgehog ( HH ) signalling pathway is a developmental pathway that 630 finely controls tissue polarity and architecture by distance - dependent ligand dispensing on target cells ( 257 ) . Of the 631 three HH family members ( Sonic , Indian and Desert HH ) , sonic HH ( SHH ) is expressed in the lung . Secreted 632 SHH binds with its receptor Patched , which releases the transmembrane protein smoothened ( SMO ) from 633 inhibition by Patched . SMO activates glioma - associated oncogene homolog ( GLI ) , allowing it to translocate into 634 the nucleus and turn on genes involved in cell proliferation , migration , angiogenesis and stem cell regeneration ( 292 ) . 635 SHH may be secreted from lung epithelial cells and acts on a variety of target cells , and thus it was considered to 636 be critically important for epithelium to mesenchyme crosstalk in IPF . For example , a few studies found 637 upregulated SHH in epithelial cells of the fibrotic human lung whereas its downstream signalling partners 638 Patched - 1 , Smoothened , and GLI1 were mainly present in fibroblasts and inflammatory cells ( 26 , 237 ) . SHH 639 overexpression was shown to increase fibroblast proliferation , migration and deposition of ECM ( 26 , 155 ) , while 640 inhibition of GLI decreases lung fibrosis and collagen accumulation ( 190 ) . In mouse pulmonary fibrosis models , an 641 increased number of GLI1 - positive cells was observed in the fibrotic tissue of bleomycin - injected lungs 4 weeks 642 after injury ( 155 ) . Interestingly , a recent study by Peng T . ( 202 ) showed that GLI1 - positive cells were decreased in the 643 parabronchial mesenchymal cells following chronic bleomycin injury to the lung , and proposed a role of epithelial 644 SHH expression in maintaining mesenchymal quiescence . These studies revealed a complex functional role of 645 SHH signalling in pulmonary fibrosis , which may be spatial , temporal and cell - type dependent . 646 16 Notch signalling pathway The Notch signalling pathway plays a major role in embryonic development through 647 direct cell - cell communication to influence fine binary cell fate decision and tissue polarity ( 72 , 280 ) . The inactive 648 transmembrane Notch is activated by the binding of ligands to its extracellular portion , followed by enzymatic 649 cleavage and nuclear translocation of its intracellular domain to turn on transcription of genes in apoptosis , cell 650 cycle , proliferation , differentiation , transcription regulation and neurogenesis . Recent studies highlighted the post - 651 injury activation of Notch signalling in lung injurious models ( 36 , 252 ) , which was shown to be critical to awake 652 progenitor cells ( 252 ) . Nevertheless , persistent Notch activity at mesenchymal cells seems to be a culprit that drives 653 normal proliferative repair to a fibrotic process ( 36 , 252 ) . Indeed , inhibition of Notch signalling promoted alveolar 654 repair and reduced fibrosis in bleomycin - induced lung injury ( 36 ) . Another noticeable role of Notch in pulmonary 655 fibrosis is to promote EMT . For example , ectopic expression of the Notch intracellular domain , or treatment of 656 alveolar epithelial cells with Notch ligand , induced expression of smooth muscle α - actin ( SMA ) , collagen I and 657 vimentin , and reduced the expression of E - cadherin , occludin , and zonula occludens – 1 , indicating EMT ( 10 ) . 658 ER stress ER stress is technically not a signalling pathway , but it plays a pivotal role in multiple pathogenic 659 aspects of ARDS and IPF such as epithelial cell apoptosis , EMT and inflammation ( 120 ) . During ER stress , ER 660 capacity to properly fold nascent proteins is reduced , and UPR occurs to regulate the expression of ER chaperons , 661 additional protein quality control genes , genes of the ER - associated protein degradation or pro - apoptotic genes ( 133 ) . 662 As described above , ER stress is a direct consequence of various injuries to lung cells including environmental 663 insults , viral infection and cigarette smoking ( 198 , 244 ) , presumably even in cells that successfully resealed their 664 membrane wounds . Although all injured lung cells undergo some degree of ER stress ( 14 , 143 ) , the ability to restore 665 homeostasis in certain cells , such as aging ATII cells harbouring misfolded surfactant proteins , may be severely 666 compromised . Therefore , it is not surprising to find that ER stress was increased in ARDS models induced either 667 by oleic acid ( OA ) or LPS ( 156 , 157 , 194 ) . Furthermore , OA - induced lung injury was exacerbated by ER stress inducer , 668 but ameliorated by ER stress inhibitor ( 156 ) , suggesting that ER stress is critically involved in the pathogenesis of 669 ARDS . ER stress may be aggravated by several disease modifiers of ARDS , such as alcohol abuse and 670 hyperoxia ( 122 , 187 ) , as well as by many disease modifiers of IPF , such as aging , oxidative stress , mutations in 671 surfactant protein , telomerase and mucin , or simply energy deficiency ( 244 ) . Although ER stress is not specific to 672 ARDS or IPF , severe ER stress is associated with lung epithelial cell death and fibrogenesis ( 133 ) . For example , 673 Flodby P et al . ( 73 ) created conditional BiP knockout specifically at ATII cells and found increased ATII cell 674 apoptosis , oxidative stress , Smad3 phosphorylation and expression of Smad3 target genes in the knockout lung . 675 Bueno M et al . showed that ER stress triggers profibrotic factor expression in epithelial cells ( 29 ) and promotes 676 EMT transition , providing a direct source of myofibroblasts in IPF ( 120 ) . In addition , EMT - derived cells further 677 promote fibrogenesis through aberrant epithelial - mesenchymal crosstalk ( 120 ) , forming a positive feedback in IPF . 678 Signalling pathway network It should be emphasized that the above signalling pathways evidently cross talk 679 with one another during fibrogenesis . For example , study by Akhmetshina A et al . showed that TGF - β stimulates 680 canonical Wnt signalling in a p38 - dependent manner by decreasing the expression of the Wnt antagonist 681 Dickkopf - 1 ( 2 ) , and the study by Lam AP et al . highlighted the role of TGF - β as a downstream factor of Wnt and 682 co - receptor Lrp5 activation in bleomycin - induced pulmonary fibrosis ( 142 ) . In addition , SHH was shown to play a 683 mutually simulative role with TGF - β and create a positive feedback loop in the fibrotic process ( 46 , 98 ) . Furthermore , 684 Notch induced myofibroblast differentiation is dependent on the TGF - β - Smad3 pathway , and inhibition of 685 endogenous Notch with small molecule inhibitor attenuated TGF - β - induced SMA expression ( 10 ) . Interestingly , 686 Cao Z et al . ( 36 ) proposed a complex signal relay network among pulmonary endothelial cells , epithelial cells , 687 macrophages and perivascular fibroblasts for the pathogenesis of IPF , in which Wnt ligand secreted from 688 activated macrophages induces Notch ligand Jagged1 expression in endothelial cells that in turn stimulates the 689 Notch signalling pathway in the neighbouring perivascular fibroblast . 690 State of the art and perspective In this section , we described prevailing signalling pathways known to b e 691 activated following lung epithelial injury in order to facilitate a big - picture view on the injury - repair - fibrosis axis . 692 What is shared in common is that these signalling pathways largely cause progenitor cell activation , mesenchymal 693 cell expansion and fibrogenesis , in favour of IPF pathogenesis . We attempt to review the mechanisms through 694 17 which injurious stimuli may activate these pathways , but this is not clear with the exception of the TGF - β 695 signalling pathway , and partly the ER stress pathway . This would be of great interest to the field . In addition , 696 information on how cellular wounding ( loss of cell function , leakage of cellular content or activation of stress 697 genes ) and repair moieties interact with components of these signalling pathways , how these interactions direct 698 the entirety of these pathways , and how these pathways affect the membrane repair process would bridge gaps in 699 current knowledge . Furthermore , as activation of proliferative and fibrotic signals is part of the normal tissue 700 healing process , while failure of resolution leads to disease state , the impact of cell wounding and repair on the 701 “off switch” of these above signalling pathways may shed light on future research . 702 Conclusion 703 Plasma membrane repair is a fundamental biological process , and key membrane repair steps are largely 704 conserved , although tissue and cell type differences may exist due to variations in organ function , cell turnover 705 rate and existence of different repair machineries . Complex physical and biochemical tissue injury factors injure 706 lung cells under pathological conditions , and lung cells engage lipid trafficking , subcortical cytoskeleton 707 rearrangement and repair machineries to mend plasma membrane wounding . Lung cell wounding and repair 708 occurs throughout injurious lung diseases and is an integrated part of ARDS and IPF etiology . Defective lung cell 709 repair , or chronic lung cell wounding , also lead to activation of aberrant tissue repair pathways following injury , 710 contributing to the pathogenesis of fibrotic lung diseases . Deep understanding of the mechanisms of membrane 711 repair provides additional insights for lung biology , and new therapeutic target for ARDS and IPF . The early 712 presence of cell injury , persistence of injurious factors , and broad indications of membrane repair therapies make 713 targeting membrane repair a particularly attractive direction for the treatment of lung injurious diseases , and thus 714 further research efforts are necessary for propelling this promising field . 715 716 717 18 Abbreviations 718 ARDS - acute respiratory distress syndrome 719 ATI - type I alveolar epithelial cells 720 ATII - type II alveolar epithelial cells 721 BALF - bronchoalveolar lavage fluid 722 Cav - caveolin 723 CSK – subcortical cytoskeleton 724 DILT - deformation - induced lipid trafficking 725 ECM – extracellular matrix 726 EGFR - epidermal growth factor receptor 727 EM - electron microscopic 728 EMT - epithelial - mesenchymal transition 729 ER - endoplasmic reticulum 730 ESCRT - endosomal sorting complex for transport 731 GLI - glioma - associated oncogene homolog 732 HH - Hedgehog 733 HV - herpesviridae 734 IL - interleukin 735 IPF - idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis 736 LAMP1 - Lysosomal - associated membrane protein 1 737 LAP - latency associated peptide 738 LDH - lactate dehydrogenase 739 Lm - mean linear intercept measurements 740 LPS - lipopolysaccharide 741 NF - κB - Nuclear factor - κB 742 OA - oleic acid 743 P188 - poloxamer 188 744 P2Y - purinergic receptor P2Y 745 P . aeruginosa - Pseudomonas aeruginosa 746 PFTs - pore - forming toxins 747 RIP - receptor - interacting protein 748 ROS - reactive oxygen species 749 SHH - Sonic hedgehog 750 SLO - streptolysin O 751 SMA - smooth muscle α - actin 752 SMO - smoothened 753 SPs - surfactant - associated proteins 754 TβR - TGF - β receptor 755 TGF - transforming growth factor 756 TNF - tumor necrosis factor 757 TNFR - tumor necrosis factor α receptor 758 TRIM - Tripartite motif - containing protein 759 UPR - unfolded protein response 760 761 762 19 Competing interests 763 The authors declare no competing interests . 764 765 766 20 Authors ' contributions 767 All authors contributed to write the manuscript ; XZ and RDH edited and approved the manuscript . 768 769 770 21 Acknowledgement 771 This work was supported by NIH R01HL116826 and EVMS start - up .

Activation of aberrant tissue repair pathways following injury . On injured epithelial cell membrane , 794 LAP binds to integrins αvβ6 to expose and activate the TGF - β . Increased activated TGF - β binds to TGF - β 795 receptor , TGFβR1 and TGFβR1 . Smad was phosphorylated and move to nucleus to promote fibrotic gene 796 expression . For Wnt signaling , injured alveolar epithelial cells secrete Wnt ligands . Wnt binds to cell surface 797 receptor Frizzled to expose β - catenin . β - catenin moves to nucleus and promote the paracrine of Wnt and WISP1 - 798 mediated EMT and collagen production . Epithelial injury promotes the secretion of SHH from injured epithelial 799 cells . SHH releases GLI by inhibiting SMO . GLI moves to nucleus to promote the fibroblasts proliferation , 800 migration and ECM deposition . Notch signaling promotes EMT in epithelial cells via TGFβ - Smad3 pathway and 801 activation in neighboring fibroblasts . ER stress induces the expression of BiP . BiP binds and activates PERK , 802 IRE1 and AFT6 . Increased CHOP which promoted by activated PERK , together with activated IRE1 , leads to cell 803 apoptosis . 804 805 23 References 806 1 .
