Hayes , 1 Grzegorz Rebowski , 2 Pekka Lappalainen , 3 Thomas D . Pollard , 4 Roberto Dominguez 2 ‡ Initiation of actin polymerization in cells requires nucleation factors . Here we describe an actin - binding protein , leiomodin , that acted as a strong filament nucleator in muscle cells . Leiomodin shared two actin - binding sites with the filament pointed end – capping protein tropomodulin : a flexible N - terminal region and a leucine - rich repeat domain . Leiomodin also contained a C - terminal extension of 150 residues . The smallest fragment with strong nucleation activity included the leucine - rich repeat and C - terminal extension . The N - terminal region enhanced the nucleation activity threefold and recruited tropomyosin , which weakly stimulated nucleation and mediated localization of leiomodin to the middle of muscle sarcomeres . Knocking down leiomodin severely compromised sarcomere assembly in cultured muscle cells , which suggests a role for leiomodin in the nucleation of tropomyosin - decorated filaments in muscles . A ctin - binding proteins suppress the sponta - neous nucleation of actin monomers into filaments , so cells use nucleation factors to initiate actin polymerization . In non - muscle cells , the best - characterized filament nucleators are actin - related protein 2 and 3 ( Arp2 / 3 ) complex and formins ( 1 ) . Less is known about the initiation of actin filaments in striated and smooth muscle cells , where specialized proteins may be used to assemble and remodel the tropomyosin - decorated filaments . We identified the protein leiomodin ( Lmod ) as a potential filament nucleator in muscle cells because sequence analysis suggested that it contained at least three actin - binding sites and could possibly recruit three actin mono - mers to form a polymerization nucleus . Thus , the first ~ 340 residues of Lmod are ~ 40 % iden - tical to tropomodulin ( Tmod ) ( fig . S1 ) , a pro - tein that caps actin filament pointed ends ( 2 , 3 ) . The N - terminal portion of Tmod is unstructured , except for three helical segments involved in binding tropomyosin ( residues 24 to 35 and 126 to 135 ) and actin ( residues 65 to 75 ) ( 4 ) . This region of Tmod caps the pointed end of actin filaments in a tropomyosin - dependent manner ( 5 ) . Tmod has a second , tropomyosin - independent , actin - binding and - capping site within the C - terminal region ( residues 160 to 359 ) ( 5 ) , consisting almost entirely of a Leu - rich repeat ( LRR ) domain ( 6 ) . Lmod shares this do - main organization but has only one of the two tropomyosin - binding sites ( Fig . 1A and fig . S1 ) . More importantly , Lmod extends ~ 150 – amino acids beyond the C terminus of Tmod . This Fig . 2 .

Between time t – 2 and t – 1 , campylobacter split into two separate species , C . jejuni and C . coli . Between t – 1 and the present ( t 0 ) , C . coli fur - ther separated into three distinct lineages representing incipient species . At t 0 C . coli clade 1 starts to accumulate genetic material imported from C . jejuni , owing to expansion into a novel agri - cultural niche . By t 1 , recombi - nation has been sufficient to make strains with a clade 1 clo - nal origin indistinguishable from C . jejuni . A more speculative projection would be that the change in environmental condi - tions could also have a substan - tial effect on clade 2 and clade 3 strains , with an elevated rate of exchange with the cosmopolitan and numerous C . jejuni clade 1 bacteria , which could lead to complete despeciation at the nucleotide level by time t 3 . www . sciencemag . org SCIENCE VOL 320 11 APRIL 2008 239 REPORTS on J une 1 , 20 15 www . sc i en c e m ag . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m on J une 1 , 20 15 www . sc i en c e m ag . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m on J une 1 , 20 15 www . sc i en c e m ag . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m on J une 1 , 20 15 www . sc i en c e m ag . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m on J une 1 , 20 15 www . sc i en c e m ag . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m extension contains a short poly - proline ( polyP ) re - gion , twosegmentswithapredictedhelicalstructure , and an actin - binding Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ) – homology 2 ( WH2 ) domain . To localize Lmod in cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes , we used fluorescent antibody staining and expression of enhanced green flu - orescent protein ( EGFP ) – Lmod fusion proteins ( 7 ) . Our rabbit polyclonal antibody against wild - type Lmod ( Lmod wt ) reacted specifically with Lmod in extracts of skeletal muscle and did not cross - react with Tmod ( fig . S2 ) . In cardiomyo - cytes , this antibody concentrated close to the M - line protein myomesin , near the center of the sarcomere ( Fig . 1B ) . EGFP - Lmod wt and EGFP - Lmod 1 – 342 , comprising the Tmod - like portion of Lmod , also concentrated in the middle of sarcomeres , well separated from a - actinin in Z - discs ( Fig . 1C ) . Thus , Lmod is located near the pointed ends of the actin filaments , which were not resolved from M lines . On the other hand , EGFP - Lmod 162 – 495 , a fragment with strong nu - cleation activity ( see below ) that included the LRR and C - terminal extension , concentrated in the nucleus . Thus , the N - terminal domain is required for Lmod localization in the center of sarcomeres . Strong overexpression of all three EGFP - Lmod constructs disrupted sarcomeric organiza - tion and induced the formation of aberrant actin structures ( fig . S3 ) . Lmod 162 – 495 had the most dramatic phenotype . Even moderate expression of Lmod 162 – 495 induced the formation of abnor - mal actin bundles in the nucleus , similar to those observed in intranuclear rod myopathy ( 8 ) . We investigated the role of Lmod in sarco - mere assembly using RNA interference ( RNAi ) to knockdown Lmod expression in cardiomyo - cytes . Cells transfected with Lmod – small inter - fering RNA ( Lmod - siRNA ) had drastically lower levels of Lmod protein than control cells ( fig . S4 ) . Fluorescent antibody staining for Lmod was strongly reduced in Lmod - siRNA cells ( Fig . 2 ) , which also lacked the striated pat - tern of Lmod observed in control cells trans - fected with a scrambled oligonucleotide . Lmod knockdown cells lacked organized sarcomeres ( Fig . 2 and S5 ) . In Lmod - siRNA cells , the Z - disc protein a - actinin concentrated in small spots , in contrast with the typical striated pattern observed in control cells ( fig . S5 ) . Lmod knock - down cells were also less adherent and spread than wild - type cells . Thus , Lmod plays a role in sarcomere assembly and organization . We studied the effect of Lmod on actin as - sembly by monitoring the fluorescence increase of 6 % pyrene - labeled actin upon polymerization . Nanomolar concentrations of Lmod wt dramati - cally stimulated polymerization compared with spontaneous actin assembly ( Fig . 3A ) . Lmod 1 – 342 was significantly less effective , although more active than Tmod , which has weak nucleation ac - tivity ( 5 ) . Lmod 162 – 342 , comprising the LRR and an additional 14 residues necessary for pointed - end capping in Tmod ( 5 ) , and Lmod 343 – 495 , cor - responding to the C - terminal extension , both had low polymerization - inducing activity . How - ever , the combination of these two constructs in Lmod 162 – 495 retained one - third of the activity of Lmod wt ( Fig . 3D ) . Deletions and substitutions in Lmod 162 – 495 suggested that each of the modules of theC - terminalextensioncontributedtothisactivity ; some seemed to bind actin directly , whereas others seemed to help properly position the actin - binding sites for assembly ( fig . S6 ) . To determine whether Lmod promoted as - sembly by stimulating nucleation or elongation , we observed Lmod - induced actin polymerization directly by total internal reflection fluorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy . The number of filaments in - creased exponentially with Lmod wt concentra - tion ( Fig . 3 , B and C , and movies S1 to S4 ) , whereas Lmod wt had no effect on the elongation rate of either filament end ( fig . S7 ) . We obtained similar results with Lmod 162 – 495 . In agreement with the bulk polymerization assay ( fig . S6 ) , constructs with deletions or substitutions of the modules of the C - terminal extension formed fewer filaments than Lmod 162 – 495 ( Fig . 3B ) .

From the time course of polymerization ( Fig . 3A and fig . S6 ) and the elongation rates es - tablished by TIRF ( fig . S7 ) , we determined that 2 m M actin formed 3 . 4 nM barbed ends per minute in the presence of 25 nM Lmod wt ( Fig . 3D ) . This high nucleation rate is comparable to that of Arp2 / 3 complex ( 9 ) . Lmod 162 – 495 re - tained one - third of this activity ( Fig . 3D ) . We tested the effect of tropomyosin on polym - erization induced by Lmod wt and Lmod 162 – 495 , which lacks the tropomyosin - binding site ( fig . S1 ) . All concentrations of tropomyosin inhib - ited polymerization by Lmod 162 – 495 ( Fig . 4A ) . In contrast , polymerization by Lmod wt was stim - ulated at low tropomyosin concentrations but inhibited at tropomyosin concentrations higher than 1 m M . This biphasic effect of tropomyosin can be explained by two opposite mechanisms : Tropomyosin weakly promotes nucleation by Lmod wt but reduces the formation of ends via spontaneous fragmentation ( 10 ) . At 1 m M con - centration , tropomyosin promoted polymeriza - tion of 2 m M actin with a range of concentrations of Lmod wt and Lmod 1 – 342 , but not Tmod , all of which were expected to bind tropomyosin ( Fig . 4B ) . This stimulatory effect of tropomyosin on Lmod - induced nucleation occurred within a physiologically relevant range , because the ratio of tropomyosin to actin in muscle thin fila - ments is 1 : 7 . The C - terminal extension of Lmod contains a short polyP sequence , a potential binding site for profilin ( fig . S1 ) . However , profilin inhibited to the same extent polymerization induced by Lmod 162 – 495 and a construct in which the polyP sequence was replaced by a glycine - serine re - peat , Lmod 162 – 495 ( polyP - GS ) ( fig . S8 ) . Thus , profilin does not seem to play a role in filament nucleation by Lmod . We used sedimentation velocity to determine the stoichiometry of the Lmod - actin polymeri - zation nucleus ( fig . S9 ) . We included latrunculin B ( LatB ) in the buffer to prevent polymeriza - tion . Separately , actin - LatB and Lmod con - structs Lmod wt , Lmod 162 – 495 , and Lmod 1 – 342 were each monomeric and soluble ( fig . S9 ) . Com - plexes of Lmod wt with actin formed a reaction boundary ( multiple species ) around 12 S , whose stoichiometry could not be determined by fitting . Mixtures of Lmod 1 – 342 with actin formed reaction boundaries around 3 . 5 S ( corresponding to actin - LatB ) and 6 . 5 S ( Fig . 4C ) . The predominant Fig . 2 .

Mixtures of Lmod 162 – 495 with actin - LatB precipitated . However , by quantitating the proteins in the supernatant using the interfer - ence optics of the ultracentrifuge , we determined the composition of the complexes in the pellets ( Fig . 4D ) . When actin was present in twofold molar excess over Lmod 162 – 495 , all of both pro - teins precipitated , indicating that Lmod 162 – 495 binds two actins . Actin may bind cooperatively to the two sites , because actin : Lmod 162 – 495 pel - leted as a 2 : 1 complex even when Lmod 162 – 495 was present in excess . Lmod 162 – 495 and Lmod 1 – 342 share one actin - binding site ( LRR domain ) and each binds two actin subunits , which suggests that full - length Lmod stabilizes a nucleus of three actin sub - units , bound to the flexible N - terminal , LRR , and WH2 domains . Information about the af - finities of actin for the three binding sites and potential cooperative binding effects will be required to trace the actual nucleation pathway [ supporting online material ( SOM ) text ] . Be - cause Lmod 162 – 495 is a strong nucleator , we propose that assembly of the nucleus begins with actin monomers binding to the LRR and WH2 domains , followed by actin binding to the flexible N terminus . The N terminus is also necessary for Lmod localization near the center of sarcomeres , which suggests that Lmod ( like Tmod ) binds to filament pointed ends , because actin and tropomyosin are the only known binding partners of this region of Lmod . Be - cause of steric hindrance , the WH2 domain may dissociate as the nucleus grows from the barbed end . After nucleation , the outcome of the other interactions of Lmod with actin and tropomyosin are unknown , but these interac - tions may serve to localize Lmod to actin fila - ment pointed ends near the center of sarcomeres . It is unknown whether Lmod can coexist with Tmod at these sites . The nucleation mechanism that we propose for Lmod has features in common with nuclea - tion by Arp2 / 3 complex together with WH2 - containing proteins , such as WASP ( Fig . 4E ) . In both cases , a WH2 domain delivers an actin monomer to complete a trimeric seed consist - ing of three actin subunits ( Lmod ) or one actin subunit and the Arp2 and Arp3 subunits of Arp2 / 3 complex . However , Arp2 / 3 complex depends on an extrinsic WH2 domain , whereas Lmod has an intrinsic WH2 and is active on its own . Arp2 / 3 complex anchors the pointed end of the Fig . 4 .

Formin dimers form nuclei and remain associated with the barbed end of the growing filament .

Lmod is also distinct from formins and spire . Formins remain bound to elongating barbed ends after initiating a filament ( 1 ) . Spire is thought to stabilize nuclei by bridging actin subunits along a filament strand ( 11 ) . A unique feature of Lmod is its ability to work in conjunction with tropo - myosin , which potentiates its nucleation activ - ity and mediates its localization to the middle of sarcomeres . The strong nucleation activity and severe knockdown phenotype make Lmod a strong candidate to nucleate tropomyosin - decorated actin filaments in muscle sarcomeres . Reference and Notes 1 . T . D .

Crawford , 1 * Paul M . Thomas , 2 Jonathan R . Scheerer , 1 Anna L . Vagstad , 1 Neil L . Kelleher , 2 † Craig A . Townsend 1 † PksA , which initiates biosynthesis of the environmental carcinogen aflatoxin B1 , is one of the multidomain iterative polyketide synthases ( IPKSs ) , a large , poorly understood family of biosynthetic enzymes . We found that dissection of PksA and its reconstitution from selected sets of domains allows the accumulation and characterization of advanced octaketide intermediates bound to the enzyme , permitting the reactions controlled by individual catalytic domains to be identified . A product template ( PT ) domain unites with the ketosynthase and thioesterase in this IPKS system to assemble precisely seven malonyl - derived building blocks to a hexanoyl starter unit and mediate a specific cyclization cascade . Because the PT domain is common among nonreducing IPKSs , these mechanistic features should prove to be general for IPKS - catalyzed production of aromatic polyketides . T ens of thousands of natural products are known from microorganisms , plants , and animals that provide hormones , toxins , flavors and fragrances , pigments , drugs , and other materials of commercial value . A handful of biosynthetic pathways give rise to this rich diversity of useful structures . Among these , polyketides are synthesized from simple acyl – coenzyme A ( acyl - CoA ) substrates by polyketide synthases ( PKSs ) ( 1 ) . We understand a great deal about the function of giant modular PKSs that synthesize complex products , for example , the antibiotic erythromycin and the immunosup - pressant rapamycin ( 2 ) . Each catalytic domain in these multidomain ( type I ) megaproteins is used once in an overall “ assembly - line ” process as a growing intermediate is advanced along the enzyme to yield a product . In contrast to these bacterial systems , in eukaryotes iterative PKSs ( IPKSs ) are generally the rule where a markedly smaller number of catalytic domains are similarly fused but individually reused in multiple catalytic cycles ( iteration ) that are “ programmed ” to yield specific products . How programming is achieved is a central unanswered question of iterative catalysis . We undertook a “ deconstruction ” approach by domain dissection and reassembly of PksA , the nonreducing IPKS of aflatoxin biosyn - thesis , to reveal the global division of labor among the domains in these macromolecular machines to control polyketide chain length , cyclization of an extended poly – b - keto inter - mediate , and product release . A domain hy - pothesized to be a “ product template ” ( PT ) has been discovered to play a central role in product formation . These studies are combined with high - resolution mass spectrometry ( MS ) to mon - itor the highly processive construction of a natu - ralproduct scaffold from multiple acyl - CoA units directly on a polyketide synthase . We previously used the UMA bioinformatics algorithm , which identifies linkers in a family of homologous proteins , to characterize the domain architecture of PksA ( 3 ) . Two unrecognized do - mains were identified in addition to four from 1 Department of Chemistry , Johns Hopkins University , Balti - more , MD 21218 , USA . 2 Department of Chemistry , University of Illinois , Urbana , IL 61801 , USA . * Present address : Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology , Harvard Medical School , 240 Longwood Avenue , Boston , MA 02115 , USA . † To whom correspondence should be addressed .

PksA accepts a C 6 fatty acid from the associated fatty acid synthase subunits ( HexA / HexB ) and homol - ogates acetyl units while attached to either the acyl carrier protein ( ACP ) or ketosynthase ( KS ) to a fixed chain length ( octaketide ) , as shown in the hypothetical in - termediate 1 ( shown as the keto form ) , R = ACP or KS . PksA controls specific cyclization chem - istry to release the norsolorinic acid anthrone ( 2 ) , which is auto - oxidized in vitro to norsolorinic acid ( 3 ) . 3 is processed through a series of oxidative rearrange - ments to aflatoxin B 1 ( 4 ) . ( B ) Fungal nonreducing PKS domain architecture ( PksA ) . Domains in - clude SAT , KS , malonyl - CoA : ACP transacylase ( MAT ) , PT , ACP , and thioesterase / Claisen cyclase ( TE / CLC ) . Many known and apparently homologous enzymes that share similar domain organization synthesize an assortment of products with alternative chain lengths and cyclization scaffolds ( 5 ) . www . sciencemag . org SCIENCE VOL 320 11 APRIL 2008 243 REPORTS DOI : 10 . 1126 / science . 1155313 , 239 ( 2008 ) ; 320 Science et al .
