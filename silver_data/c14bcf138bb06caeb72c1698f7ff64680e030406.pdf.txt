These regulatory events at enhancers contribute to the speci ﬁ c gene expression programs that determine cell state and the potential for differentiation into new cell types . Although enhancer elements are known to be associated with certain histone modi ﬁ cations and transcription factors , therelationship ofthesemodi ﬁ cations togene expression and developmental state has not been clearly de ﬁ ned . Here we interrogate the epigenetic landscape of enhancer elements in embryonic stem cells and several adult tissues in the mouse . We ﬁ nd that histone H3K27ac distinguishes active enhancers from inactive / poised enhancer elements containing H3K4me1 alone . This indicates that the amount of actively used enhancers is lower than previously anticipated . Furthermore , poised enhancer networks provide clues to unrealized developmental programs . Finally , we show that enhancers are reset during nuclear reprogramming . T he genome comprises a large number of noncoding DNA regulatory elements , including silencers , insulators , and en - hancer regions , that play important regulatory roles in maintain - ing gene expression programs . Enhancers have emerged as key cis - regulatory elements that can affect gene transcription in - dependent of their orientation or distance . Global identi ﬁ cation of these regions as well as their contribution to target gene ex - pression has been challenging because enhancers can often reside thousands of base pairs away from their target of regulation ( 1 , 2 ) . Individual enhancers have been identi ﬁ ed by detailed studies of disease - related elements that reside in noncoding regions outside of model genes ( 3 ) , followed on a larger scale by com - parative genomics using ultra - conservation ( 4 ) . These studies unequivocally established speci ﬁ c cis - regulatory elements as important regulators of development and disease . Recently efforts to globally identify enhancers have focused on the histone mark H3K4me1 to locate many cell type - speci ﬁ c enhancer sites ( 5 – 9 ) . Analysis of human primary and tumor cell lines has shown that enhancer regions identi ﬁ ed by virtue of H3K4me1 enrich - ment , as well as DNaseI hypersensitivity , display a cell type - speci ﬁ c distribution across the genome ( 5 , 10 ) . Another study found that the histone acetyltransferase p300 is enriched at enhancers in fetal mouse tissues and found similar tissue - speci ﬁ c marking of these elements . Notably , many of these enhancers were shown to contribute to transcriptional activity of proximal genes in a tissue - speci ﬁ c manner ( 11 ) . Although most H3K4me1 marked enhancer regions displayed activity when tested in reporter assays , a signi ﬁ cant percentage was not active ( 5 , 11 ) . One hypothesis is that H3K4me1 can mark active enhancers as well as those in a poised or predetermined state . Indeed , several lines of evidence support the existence of poised enhancers . Lineage - speci ﬁ c enhancers that become acti - vated upon differentiation are protected from DNA methylation in the parental ES cells , where the enhancers are not yet active ( 12 ) . Furthermore , large sets of inactive developmental genes in hematopoietic stem cells are associated with H3K4me1 - enriched distal enhancers ( 13 ) . Finally distal H3K4me1 - enriched Stat1 binding sites become selectively activated upon INF - γ treatment of HeLa cells , suggesting that these regions maintain the po - tential to become active ( 5 ) . This raises the intriguing possibility that enhancers contain information about the current and future developmental potential of a cell , as well as its ability to respond to external cues . Here , we identify close to 135 , 000 candidate distal enhancer regions in ﬁ ve different cell types . In a candidate approach to identify factors that could potentially discriminate between the various possible enhancer states , we establish H3K27ac as an important enhancer mark that can distinguish between active and poised enhancer elements . This mark can be deposited by both p300 and CREB binding protein ( CBP ) ( 14 ) and is associated with active promoters in mammalian cells ( 15 ) . Using this modi ﬁ cation to distinguish poised from active enhancer networks allows us to make predictions on the developmental potency of the cell , as well as it current state . Furthermore , it suggests that the active global enhancer network of a cell is smaller than previously anticipated . Results H3K27ac Distinguishes Active from Inactive Enhancers . We ﬁ rst identi ﬁ ed cell type - speci ﬁ c enhancers in murine ES cells using distal H3K4me1 histone marks identi ﬁ ed by ChIP - Seq ( Fig . 1 A , Table S1 , and SI Materials and Methods ) using similar criteria as shown previously ( 5 – 9 , 16 ) . We identi ﬁ ed 25 , 036 distal enhancer elements that are roughly equally distributed between introns and intergenic regions ( Fig . S1 A ) . To test the robustness of these data we compared our results with a previously published H3K4me1 data set in 129 / C57BL6 F1 ES cells ( 17 ) and found that they displayed a remarkably similar distribution pattern ( Pearson correlation , 0 . 76 ; Fig . S1 B and C ) . Second ES cells from an inbred genetic background ( C57BL6 / N ) yielded very similar results ( Pearson correlation , 0 . 77 ) , indicating that cell type - speci ﬁ c enhancers pattern the genome with high ﬁ delity with little effect from genetic background . Proximal gene expression was previously shown to be prefer - entially affected by enhancer elements ( 11 ) , and enhancers seem to cluster near the genes they regulate ( 5 ) .

Consistent with its role as a master regu - lator of ES cell state , motif search analysis identi ﬁ ed the Oct4 ( POU ) binding domain at ES cell enhancers ( P = 1 . 0E - 250 ) , suggesting a role for this transcription factor in enhancer regu - lation . Indeed , this transcription factor was previously seen enriched at promoter distal elements similar to other ES cell regulators , such as Sox2 and Nanog ( 18 ) . We decided to test a number of enhancer - associated transcription factors and chromatin modi ﬁ cations in ES cells as potential candidates to distinguish between active and inactive enhancer elements . We generated data sets for p300 and H3K27ac and adapted datasets for Oct4 , Sox2 , Klf4 , p300 , and Nanog from previous work ( 18 , 19 ) and found that a signi ﬁ cant amount of the putative ES cell enhancers identi ﬁ ed here were enriched for the factors tested ( Fig . 1 D and Fig . S2 ) . For instance , the histone acetyltransferase p300 has been used as a reliable marker to identify distal enhancers ( 10 , 11 , 16 ) and in agreement with this could be found associated with a signi ﬁ cant portion of H3K4me1 - enriched regions ( Fig . 1 D ) . Notably , genes closest to H3K4me1 - positive p300 - bound enhancers are not preferentially more active com - pared with genes associated with H3K4me1 - positive enhancers that do not contain p300 ( P < 1 . 0 ) , suggesting that similar to H3K4me1 , p300 can be used to identify both active and less active enhancer types ( Fig . S2 ) . Similarly , proximal genes to Nanog - bound ( P = 0 . 46 ) and Klf4 - bound enhancers ( P < 1 . 0 ) were not signi ﬁ cantly different from average enhancers . In - terestingly Oct4 - and Sox2 - bound enhancers correlated with less active genes ( Fig . 1 B and Fig . S2 ; P = 0 . 008 and P = 0 . 002 ) , suggesting these factors might be involved in keeping enhancers in an inactive state until differentiation ensues . Because this idea is similar to what has been shown for polycomb group proteins at poised promoter regions that combine multiple different factors that in differentiated cells behave in a mutually exclusive manner ( 20 , 21 ) , we asked whether Oct4 - and Sox2 - positive enhancers were enriched for the polycomb - associated mark H3K27me3 ( Table S1 ) but could ﬁ nd no signi ﬁ cant overrepresentation of H3K27me3 at Oct4 - enriched ( P = 0 . 19 ) or Sox2 - enriched ( P = 0 . 88 ) enhancer elements . Furthermore , only 1 . 2 % of identi ﬁ ed enhancer elements were enriched for H3K27me3 . In contrast to Oct4 and Sox2 , H3K27ac - modi ﬁ ed enhancer regions correlated well with enhanced proximal gene activity ( P = 1 . 0E - 5 ) . Im - portantly we also found that enhancer proximal genes that lack H3K27ac enrichment displayed lower expression levels com - pared with the average enhancer proximal gene ( Fig . 1 C ; P = 4 . 06E - 7 ) . These data indicate that H3K27ac is a good candidate to discriminate between active and poised enhancer states . In support of this , we found that Oct4 ( P = 1 . 8E - 8 ) and Sox2 ( P = 1 . 7E - 8 ) are selectively enriched at H3K27ac - negative enhancers . Because genes can be associated with multiple enhancers that are either H3K4me1 + , H3K27ac + , or a combination of both , we analyzed the relationship between H2K27ac and H3K4me1 and proximal gene activity according to a simple hierarchy to ﬁ lter out the effects of single enhancer regions on the expression of neighboring genes ( SI Materials and Methods ) . We found that genes associated with distal H3K4me1 regions that are H3K27ac negative and also lack any other neighboring H3K27ac - positive enhancer region express at a much lower level than neighboring genes of average enhancers ( P = 1 . 93E - 13 ; Fig . S3 A ) . This suggests that H3K27ac enrichment is a deterministic feature of active enhancers . In support of this , genes that are associated with distal H3K27ac - enriched regions that are negative for H3K4me1 showed overall similar expression levels as proximal genes of enhancers enriched for both H3K27ac and H3K4me1 ( P = 0 . 94 ) . Furthermore , these data suggest that in addition to H3K4me1 , distal H3K27ac sites that do not show signi ﬁ cant H3K4me1 enrichment should also be considered as potential enhancer elements . It has previously been shown that enhancers that associate with promoters and support transcription of neighboring genes produce small RNA products that depend on the presence of the proximal promoter ( 8 ) . We asked whether H3K27ac - enriched enhancers selectively expressed these short RNAs using a small RNA - Seq data set previously published ( 22 ) and found that these short RNAs are indeed selectively transcribed from H3K27ac - positive over H3K27ac - negative enhancer elements ( Fig . 1 E ; P = 1E - 154 ) regardless of H3K4me1 enrichment . This again supports the notion that H3K27ac is a deterministic factor of active enhancer elements . H3K27ac Marking of Active Enhancers Is a General Phenomenon . We next generated chromatin state maps for H3K4me1 and H3K4me3 and H3K27ac enrichment in proB cells , neural pro - genitor cells ( NPCs ) , and adult liver to further test the re - lationship between this modi ﬁ cation and active enhancers ( Table S1 ) . We identify a total of 94 , 437 different putative enhancer regions on the basis of distal H3K4me1 enrichment ( Fig . 2 A and Fig . S1 ) . H3K4me1 and H3K4me3 datasets in NPCs were adapted from previous work ( 17 ) . The genomic distribution of these sites was highly cell type speci ﬁ c ( Pearson correlation , between 0 . 01 and 0 . 19 ) , and genes that were associated with distal H3K4me1 in a single cell type displayed enhanced tran - H3K4me1 H3K4me3 25036 pu t a (cid:2) v e e nh a n c e r s 21166 T SS s A B C H3K27ac H3K4me1 Short RNA E S e nh a n c e r s D 0 . 00 % 10 . 00 % 20 . 00 % 30 . 00 % 40 . 00 % E 100 0 P e r c e n t a g e e n r i c h m e n t 100 0 p e r c e n t il e p e r c e n t il e Fig . 1 .

S4 ] . Furthermore , these particular genes correlated well with tissue - speci ﬁ c function [ Fig . 2 C ( e . g . , liver ) ] . Motif search analysis on conserved DNA sequence at these cell type - speci ﬁ c enhancers identi ﬁ ed DNA binding motifs for the known en - hancer regulators Foxa2 ( P = 5 . 3E - 18 ) in liver and PU . 1 ( P = 5 . 2E - 06 ) in proB cells ( 7 , 23 ) ( Fig . S5 ) . Examination of ChIP - Seq data ( 7 , 24 ) con ﬁ rmed that both Foxa2 and PU . 1 occupy these enhancer regions in the corresponding adult tissues ( P = 7 . 53E - 147 ; Fig . 2 A and Fig . S5 ) , providing support for the robustness of these putative enhancer data sets . In neural progenitors , we determined that a cis - regulatory element called the x - box that is recognized by the transcription factor Rfx ( 25 ) was highly enriched at enhancers ( P = 4 . 5E - 125 ) . Interestingly , Drosophila RFX is required for sensory neuron differentiation ( 26 ) . Because mammalian Rfx proteins have not been previously linked to global enhancer patterning , we performed ChIP - Seq using anti - bodies speci ﬁ c for Rfx1 in neural progenitors ( Table S1 ) and found that Rfx1 is selectively enriched at neural precursor enhancers ( P = 8 . 9E - 139 ) . This suggests that , similar to Foxa2 in liver and PU . 1 in proB cells , Rfx family members are involved in enhancer patterning during neural development . We next analyzed the chromatin state maps for H3K27ac en - richment ( Fig . 3 A and Table S1 ) , identifying a total of 40 , 274 enriched promoter distal regions according to the same criteria used to identify distal H3K4me1 regions . Similar to H3K4me1 - enriched regions , cell - speci ﬁ c patterning was observed for the H3K27ac mark at identi ﬁ ed enhancer sites ( Fig . 3 B ; correlation between − 0 . 05 and 0 . 08 ) . These data show that distal H3K27ac enrichment is at least as diverse between cell types as distal H3K4me1 enrichment . Similarly to H3K4me1 , the majority of distal H3K27ac enrichment was found within introns and inter - genic regions at a roughly equal distribution . In agreement with our ﬁ ndings in ES cells , we ﬁ nd that the activity of proximal genes correlates positively with distal H3K27ac enrichment in all adult tissues [ Fig . 3 C ( e . g . , liver ) and Fig . S4 ] and that H3K4me1 - enriched distal regions that are void of H3K27ac do not correlate with enhanced gene activity .

PNAS | December 14 , 2010 | vol . 107 | no . 50 | 21933 S Y S T E M S B I O L O G Y S EE C O MM E N T A RY distinguishes active from inactive enhancers seems to be a general phenomenon . We were able to identify known active enhancers in a tissue - speci ﬁ c manner , such as for example the E μ enhancer of the Ig heavy chain locus in proB cells ( 27 ) , as well as the 3 ′ en - hancer in the same region by using H3K27ac as a marker ( Fig . S6 ) . Notably two of the transcription factors identi ﬁ ed by motif anal - ysis in the adult cell types tested also correlate well with more active enhancers being PU . 1 in proB cells ( P < 3 . 67E - 4 ) and Rfx1 in NPCs ( P < 6 . 0E - 4 ) ( Fig . S5 ) . Enhancer elements negative for these factors were , however , not consistently different from av - erage enhancers . This indicates that select transcription factors mark speci ﬁ c subsets of active enhancers . Global Enhancer Patterns Are Reset During Nuclear Reprogramming . Previous studies have shown that the bivalent chromatin con - formation comprising H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 marks are reset in induced pluripotent stem ( iPS ) cells ( 28 ) . To test whether enhancer elements are also reset we generated chromatin state maps for H3K4me1 in ﬁ broblasts and ﬁ broblast - derived iPS cells ( Table S1 ) . We used the iPS cell line that was previously shown to express all markers of pluripotency , give rise to fully de - veloped embryos by tetraploid complementation , and contribute to the germ line ( 29 ) . We found that enhancer distribution was indeed reset to the ES cell con ﬁ guration in iPS cells ( Fig . 4 A and B ; correlation , 0 . 81 ) relative to the parental ﬁ broblasts ( corre - lation , 0 . 19 ) . This result again supports the notion that proper reestablishment of the histone marks that pattern enhancer networks is important for changes in cell fate determination . Distal H3K27ac Enrichment Is a Good Predictor of Current Devel - opmental State . Because there seem to be two classes of enhancers , active ( H3K27ac + ) and poised ( H3K27ac - ) , this raises the in - triguing possibility that enhancers contain information about the current and future developmental potential of a cell , as well as its ability to respond to external cues . To test this hypothesis , we de - termined the functions associated with enhancer proximal genes using Gene Ontology ( GO ) analysis . We analyzed distal enhancers according to H3K4me1 and H3K27ac enrichment separately and found similar enriched annotations associated with the adult de - velopmental state of the different cell types , although with higher con ﬁ dence for H3K27ac than found for H3K4me1 . We also un - covered additional functions that could not be classi ﬁ ed by H3K4me1associationalone , suchasdevelopmentalprocesses ( P = 4 . 5E - 4 ) and embryonic development ( P = 7 . 1E - 3 ) in ES cells . This suggests that using proximal genes to H3K27ac - positive enhancers can more accurately predict developmental state than H3K4me1 alone . Interestingly , we also found developmental functions that were more speci ﬁ c for genes proximal to the H3K4me1 mark , such as activation of plasma proteins in response to acute in ﬂ ammatory response in liver ( Fig . S7 ) , which is a function of the liver in re - sponse to an external stimulus . Typically , we would expect such a function to be supported by enhancers that are poised for acti - vation under normal conditions until an in ﬂ ammatory stimulus is given . This idea is consistent with the presence of the distal H3K4me1 enhancer mark but the absence of enhanced proximal gene expression associated with these marks ( Fig . 3 D ) and thus supports the idea that these enhancers exist in a poised state . In neural progenitors the diversity between GO functions found for H3K4me1 proximal genes and H3K27ac proximal genes was most pronounced ( Fig . 5 ) .

These two groups displayed two very distinct sets of GO functions ( Fig . 5 C and D ) with essentially no overlap . Functions related to an adult neuronal state , such as synaptic transmission and neurotransmitter receptor activity , were found while interrogating genes associated with silent H3K4me1 - based enhancers ( Fig . 5 D ) , whereas the more active H3K27ac - associ - ated genes generated GO functions that are more typical of a multipotent stem cell , such as anatomical structure development and nervous system development ( Fig . 5 C ) . Given the fact that neural progenitors function as precursors of the neural lineages that can give rise to many adult cell types in the brain , such as adult neurons , oligodendrocytes , and astrocytes ( 30 ) , it ﬁ ts that the genes proximal to active H3K27ac - positive enhancers re ﬂ ect such a progenitor state . Conversely , genes proximal to H3K27ac - negative enhancer regions re ﬂ ect the future more committed state of these cells , which again supports the notion that these enhancers exist in a predetermined state . Select Poised Enhancers Are Activated During Differentiation to Support the New Developmental State . To test whether poised enhancers that are activated during lineage commitment would be indicative of a new developmental state , we used data from ES cells and NPCs , which can be directly derived from ES cells in culture ( 30 ) . On the basis of our model , we predict that ES cells would contain poised enhancers that be - come active ( H3K27ac + ) in neural progenitors ( Fig . 7 ) . Proxi - mal genes to these enhancers should become selectively activated and re ﬂ ect the new developmental state of the neural progenitors . We were indeed able to identify poised enhancers in ES cells that became speci ﬁ cally activated ( H3K27ac + ) in neural progenitors but not in liver or proB cells ( Fig . 6 A ) . In agreement with these data we found that proximal genes to these enhancers were selectively activated in neural progenitors but not in any of the other cell types ( Fig . 6 B ) . Finally , we performed GO analysis on these genes and found functions such as nervous system development and differentiation indicating that they re ﬂ ect the newly acquired cellular function ( Fig . 6 C ) . Neuro - glycan - C ( Fig . 6 D ) and Neurophilin - 2 ( Fig . S8 ) are two such genes that harbor poised enhancers in ES cells that become active in neural progenitors . These data support the notion that enhancers play a deterministic role in cellular differentiation by activating poised enhancers when a cell switches developmental state and that H3K27ac can be used to discriminate between the two enhancer states . Discussion Here we have identi ﬁ ed a composite set of ≈ 135 , 000 putative enhancer elements in embryonic stem cells and several adult cell types using both distal H3K4me1 - and distal H3K27ac - enriched regions for global enhancer discovery . We show that the genomic location of marked enhancer regions is highly diverse between the different cell types tested , and proximal genes to these regions are not only more active but also re ﬂ ect the associated developmental state of the cell . Additionally , we show that enhancers are faithfully redistributed to an ES cell - like pattern during reprogramming of ﬁ broblasts into iPS cells . These results offer further support for the importance of global enhancer networks in establishing cellular identity . H3K27ac is one of the modi ﬁ cations that were shown to be present at a subset of enhancers ( 16 ) , yet its relevance was un - clear . We establish the H3K27ac modi ﬁ cation as an important mark for enhancer identi ﬁ cation that can distinguish between active and inactive enhancer regions according to the expression of proximal genes and preferential eRNA production .

PNAS | December 14 , 2010 | vol . 107 | no . 50 | 21935 S Y S T E M S B I O L O G Y S EE C O MM E N T A RY distal H3K27ac - enriched regions are less abundant than distal H3K4me1 - enriched regions , these data suggest that the amount of enhancers actively used by a cell is signi ﬁ cantly less than was previously postulated , on the basis of H3K4me1 . The fact that distal enhancers without H3K27ac do not correlate with more active proximal gene expression as compared with av - erage genes suggests these elements exist in a poised state ready to become active after external cues . Data that support the existence of poised enhancers have been previously presented ( 5 , 12 , 13 ) . By using H3K27ac we can now discriminate between the two states on a global scale , thus producing more general information on current and possible future developmental states ( Fig . 7 ) . Some transcription factors bound to enhancers , such as Rfx1 in neural precursors , also correlated with enhanced gene activity , whereas others correlated with less active proximal gene activity . Proximal genes to transcription factor - negative enhancers were in all cases not signi ﬁ cantly different from average enhancers , sug - gesting that these transcription factors bind subsets of active or inactive enhancers . This suggests that enhancers can be subdivided into multipledifferentfunctional classesinvolvedat different stages of enhancer activation and could be used to identify poised en - hancer networks that respond to more speci ﬁ c signals . Interest - ingly , Oct4 and Sox2 both associated with less active enhancer ele - ments in ES cells , suggesting that they might be involved in keeping developmental regulators in a poised state , similar to polycomb group proteins at promoters . Finally , genome - wide association studies have identi ﬁ ed disease - associated polymorphisms that reside outside of coding regions ( 31 ) . Global enhancer identi ﬁ cation across different tissues could identify subsets of these polymorphisms as enhancer elements , thus providing valuable insight into how some of these regions cause disease in a tissue - speci ﬁ c manner .
