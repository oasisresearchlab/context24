None of the constructs bind PIP 2 , but all those that precisely encompass the predicted EVH1 region can bind the WIP fragment . ( E ) Deletion mapping reveals that a 25 residue polypeptide from WIP ( residues 461 – 485 ) is the minimal fragment required for binding to the N - WASP EVH1 domain ( residues 26 – 147 ) in a far - Western gel overlay binding assay . et al . , 2001 ) .

It has not been determined , however , Despite its importance in the pathology of WAS , the precise molecular function of the WASP EVH1 domain if these motifs are sufficient to mediate the interaction between WASP and WIP . Furthermore , homology mod - has remained unclear ( Insall and Machesky , 1999 ) .

EVH1 domains share the same overall fold with Pleck - neken et al . , 2000 ; Prehoda et al . , 1999 ) . These inconsis - tent findings have several possible explanations : ( 1 ) the strin Homology ( PH ) domains ( Fedorov et al . , 1999 ; Pre - hoda et al . , 1999 ; Ball et al . , 2000 ; Barzik et al . , 2001 ; N - WASP / WASP EVH1 domain may differ significantly in structure from other EVH1 domains ; ( 2 ) these domains Beneken et al . , 2000 ) , many of which specifically bind phosphoinositides ( Rebecchi and Scarlata , 1998 ) . Thus , may have multiple binding sites—one that interacts with peptides and another that interacts with other ligands it has been suggested that EVH1 domains may be bi - functional , interacting with both peptides and phospho - such as PIP 2 ; or ( 3 ) these domains may use a mechanism of peptide interaction that is significantly different from inositides ( Prehoda et al . , 1999 ) . WIP is an actin binding protein that contains several that of other EVH1 domains . Structure of the N - WASP EVH1 - WIP Complex 567 Figure 2 .

A conserved charged residue array in the WASP family EVH1 domains , described in Figure 5 , are indicated in red ( negative ) or blue ( positive ) . Here , we have sought to clarify what ligands the generated several fragments encompassing the mouse N - WASPEVH1domainandtestedthemforphospholipid N - WASP EVH1 domain can specifically bind and how WAS - causing mutants may disrupt these interactions . binding . Phospholipid vesicle binding assays show that none of the N - WASP fragments are capable of binding We find that the N - WASP EVH1 domain and other EVH1 domains cannot bind PIP 2 with significant affinity , con - PIP 2 with detectable affinity using this assay ( Figure 1B ) . In contrast , in the same assay , strong PIP 2 binding is trary to a previous report . However , we find that the N - WASP EVH1 domain can specifically interact with a observed for two other known lipid binding modules : the Pleckstrin Homology ( PH ) domain from phospholi - 25 residue peptide from WIP . We have determined the structure of the EVH1 - WIP peptide complex using NMR pase C - delta ( PLC - (cid:1) ) and a fragment of N - WASP ( resi - dues 178 – 274 ) that includes a highly basic region ( B spectroscopy , revealing that the domain adopts the same overall fold as other EVH1 domains , but it utilizes domain ) that has recently been shown to mediate PIP 2 regulation in N - WASP ( Prehoda et al . , 2000 ; Rohatgi et a novel mechanism of peptide recognition .

We also show that a canonical EVH1 domain , from the protein Mena , is also not capable of binding EVH1 ligands , wraps around the entire EVH1 domain like a piece of string around a spool , contacting regions PIP 2 in this assay . Thus , despite a high degree of struc - tural homology with PH domains , EVH1 domains do not on the domain surface extending far beyond the canoni - cal EVH1 peptide binding site . The structure reveals a generally appear to share the function of high - affinity phosphoinositide binding , at least at a level comparable novel class of domain - mediated protein - protein interac - tions and suggests how WAS - causing mutations are to that observed for canonical PH domains ( K d (cid:1) 1 (cid:2) M ) . likely to disrupt the WASP / WIP interaction .

The extensive interaction interface in the N - WASP / of the Ran - RanBP complex , a (cid:1) 25 residue polypeptide sequence from Ran wraps around the entire RanBP WIP interaction may explain the biochemical behavior of the domain—this exposed , largely hydrophobic binding EVH1 domain , following the same path as that observed for the WIP peptide when binding the N - WASP EVH1 surface may lead to the poor solubility of the unliganded domain .

In the current NMR structure , the conformation of Common Elements of Proline - Rich Peptide Binding residues 479 – 485 ( C - terminal end of the WIP peptide ) are poorly defined because of a lack of resonance as - The most N - terminal portion of the WIP polypeptide , which contains the sequence LPPP , binds at the same signments . The difficulty in assigning these residues may be a result of several possibilities : first , the main conserved aromatic surface used by other EVH1 do - mains for proline peptide binding ( Figure 4 ) . As is ob - chain amide protons may have relatively high solvent accessibility and exchange rates ; second , the residues served in other EVH1 - peptide complexes , this region of the peptide adopts a polyproline II ( PPII ) helical confor - may exist in multiple conformations that interconvert within the intermediate exchange regime ; and third , the mation , a left - handed helix with three residues per turn .

Interestingly , thispackingunitliesdirectly ( Cys , His , Leu , Pro ) has been found in the WAS patient beneath the proline - rich peptide binding surface . In fact , population ( Table 2B ) .

Given the distance of this mutational hotspot from Thus , it seems possible that subtle mutations in this the canonical peptide binding site identified in pre - packing unit perturb the precise stereochemistry of the viously characterized EVH1 domain complexes , it has proline - rich peptide binding surface and thereby impair been difficult to reconcile how these mutations in WASP WIP binding . This hypothesis is consistent with several might disrupt EVH1 domain interactions and function previous findings : first , the Tyr97 [ 107 ] - Cys and Ala124 ( Beneken et al . , 2000 ) . [ 134 ] - Thr mutations were found to impair interaction In the context of this new structure , however , we now with WIP in an in vitro yeast two - hybrid binding assay know that the WIP ligand wraps around the N - WASP ( Stewart et al . , 1999 ) ; and second , studies of patient EVH1 domain , extending from the canonical proline - rich samples reveal no significant decrease of endogenous peptide - docking site all the way to mutational hotspot expression levels of the WASP protein in a patient bear - surrounding Arg76 [ 86 ] . Contacts made in this region ing a mutation at Tyr97 [ 107 ] . arethereforelikelytobecriticalforWIPbinding .

( E ) Alignment of WIP homologs in the WASP binding peptide reveals two regions of high conservation , including the C - terminal PSKxxR / K motif that is likely to dock at the surface shown in ( D ) . Charged residues are colored in red ( negative ) or blue ( positive ) . ( F ) Cartoon of how the extended WIP peptide and its homologs may wrap around the N - WASPEVH1domaintocontacttwodistant but energetically important binding surfaces . Based on the evidence given below , we postulate that conserved in all WIP homologs , including mouse WIP , human CR16 , and yeast verprolin—all of which have the C - terminal end of the WIP peptide binds at this mutational hotspot and participates in an energetically been shown to interact with WASP or WASP homologs ( Figure 5E ) . This cluster of basic residues is within the critical network of electrostatic interactions . First , the proposed binding path for the remaining portions of conserved motif : P - S - K - x - x - R / K - x ( 1 - 3 ) - R . In summary , we therefore propose a model in which the conserved basic the peptide correlates exactly with the binding groove utilized by the RanBP EVH1 domain to recognize one motif found at the C terminus of the WIP ligand specifi - cally interacts with a complementary network of con - terminus of the Ran peptide ( see Figure 3D ) . Second , mutation of the central Arg76 [ 86 ] to His has been shown served acidic residues that are properly positioned by the central Arg76 [ 86 ] residue ( Figure 5F ) . Such an inter - to impair interaction with WIP in an in vitro yeast two - hybrid assay ( Stewart et al . , 1999 ) . Third , Arg76 [ 86 ] is action may have a fairly high degree of mobility , consis - tent with the difficulty in observing assignable reso - the central residue in a conserved electrostatic network presented on this surface of the EVH1 domain ( Figure nances , despite its apparent energetic importance . Overall , this structure is therefore consistent with a 5D ) . Surrounding Arg76 [ 86 ] are a ring of acidic residues , Asp67 [ 77 ] , Glu88 [ 98 ] , and Glu90 [ 100 ] ( Figure 5D ) , all simple model for the cause of WAS : the major defect in these diverse WAS missense mutations is likely to be of which are conserved from human WASP / N - WASP to the yeast ortholog , Bee1p ( see Figure 2 ) . In the current disruption of the interaction with WIP . Disruption of this interaction may prevent proper subcellular targeting of structure , Arg76 [ 86 ] is very well ordered for an arginine residue—several interresidueNOEs are observedfor the WASP . The reason that mutations are found at sites widely spread over the EVH1 domain surface , well be - Arg side chain , and its epsilon NH proton exchanges very slowly . This observation is consistent with Arg76 yond the canonical EVH1 peptide binding surface , is becausethis EVH1domain utilizesa novelmode ofinter - [ 86 ] playing a central role in coordinating and orienting this otherwise repulsive network of surrounding acidic action—the WIP ligand wraps around almost two - thirds of the entire circumference of the EVH1 domain , con - residues .

Comparison of the WIP ligand and its tains a His6 - tag followed by a Tobacco Etch Virus ( TEV ) protease homologs from different species suggest that there are cleavage site . For uniform labeling with 15 N and 13 C , BL21 ( DE3 ) cells freshly transformed with the WIP - EVH1 expression plasmid were two conserved submotifs that are recognized : the grown in M9 minimal media containing [ 13 C ] glucose ( 2 g / l ) and N - terminal PPP submotif , similar to other EVH1 ligands , [ 15 N ] ammonium chloride ( 1 g / l ) as the respective sole carbon and and the C - terminal PSKxxR submotif . These two sub - nitrogen sources . Expression was induced by the addition of IPTG motifs interact on opposite faces of the EVH1 domain , to a final concentration of 1 mM . After expression for 3 hr , the cells leading to this very extensive wrapping mechanism of were harvested by centrifugation , resuspended in Lysis Buffer ( 50 recognition ( Figures 5E and 5F ) .
