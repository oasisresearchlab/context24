The detailed mechanisms used to control filament assembly at plus ends in the presence of diverse and often opposing regulators is not clear . Here we explore and identify residues important for the plus - end related activities of IQGAP1 . In multi - wavelength TIRF assays , we directly visualize dimers of IQGAP1 , mDia1 , and CP on filament ends alone and as a multicomponent end binding complex . IQGAP1 promotes the turnover of end - binding proteins reducing the dwell times of CP , mDia1 , or mDia1 - CP ‘decision complexes’ by 8 - 18 - fold . Loss of these ac - tivities in cells disrupts actin filament arrays , morphology , and migration . Together , our results reveal a role for IQGAP1 in promoting protein turnover on filament ends and provide new insights into how actin assembly is regulated in cells . actin | IQGAP1 | formin | capping protein Correspondence : ridillaj @ upstate . edu Introduction Actin filament assembly at the leading edge is highly reg - ulated to produce filaments of specific length and structure to power diverse cell processes . Short filaments present in lamellipodia are regulated by high affinity interactions with plus ends and capping protein ( CP ) which block filament polymerization ( Fujiwara et al . , 2014 ; Funk et al . , 2021 ; Wear et al . , 2003 ) . In contrast , long unbranched filaments present in filopodia or stress fibers are produced by plus end binding formin proteins , like mDia1 ( Breitsprecher & Goode , 2013 ; Chesarone et al . , 2010 ; Funk et al . , 2021 ; Goode & Eck , 2007 ; Kovar et al . , 2006 ; Rottner et al . , 2017 ; Zweifel et al . , 2021 ) . Filament polymerization is further refined by complexes with formin to enhance ( e . g . , APC , CLIP - 170 , or spire ) or with CP to limit ( e . g . , twinfilin or CARMIL ) assem - bly ( Bosch et al . , 2007 ; Bradley et al . , 2020 ; Breitsprecher et al . , 2012 ; Hakala et al . , 2021 ; Henty - Ridilla et al . , 2016 ; Montaville et al . , 2014 ; Mwangangi et al . , 2021 ; Stark et al . , 2017 ; Ulrichs et al . , 2023 ; Wirshing et al . , 2023 ) . Re - markably , CP and mDia1 also form ‘decision complexes’ that pause filament assembly , until either protein leaves the plus end , reinitiating growth if CP dissociates first or extending the pause in growth if formin departs the first ( Bombardier et al . , 2015 ; Maufront et al . , 2022 ; Shekhar et al . , 2015 ) . IQ - motif containing GTPase activating protein 1 ( IQGAP1 ) is a conserved 189 kDa scaffolding protein that coordinates actin and microtubule dynamics , cell signaling pathways , and other essential cell processes ( Brandt et al . , 2007 ; Brown & Sacks , 2006 ; Cao et al . , 2015 ; Hedman et al . , 2015 ; Shan - non , 2012 ; White et al . , 2012 ) . IQGAP1 influences actin fila - ments in two ways : filament bundling via side - binding inter - actions , through an N - terminal calponin homology domain ( CHD ) , and transient suppression of plus end growth via a 913 amino acid stretch of residues located in its C - terminus ( 744 - 1657 ) ( Bashour et al . , 1997 ; Hoeprich et al . , 2022 ; J . Liu et al . , 2016 ; Pelikan - Conchaudron et al . , 2011 ; Ren et al . , 2005 ) . Notably , IQGAP1 is also a ligand of formins ( i . e . , mDia1 and INF2 ) ( Bartolini et al . , 2016 ; Brandt et al . , 2007 ; Chen et al . , 2020 ) . Whether IQGAP1 - formin activities influ - ence actin assembly or multi - component plus - end regulatory systems like the formin - CP ‘decision complex’ is not known . Here we identify the residues in IQGAP1 that mediate inter - actions with actin filament plus ends and that are required for transient filament capping . We examine the molecular inter - play of IQGAP1 with the formin mDia1 , CP , and the mDia1 - CP decision complex at the plus end using single - molecule TIRF microscopy in four wavelengths . We show that IQ - GAP1 slows the mean rate of formin - assisted actin filament elongation . Further , IQGAP1 acts as a displacement factor freeing plus ends from mDia1 , CP , or decision complexes . The loss of these activities disturbs cellular actin arrays , mor - phology , and migration . Overall , this strongly suggests IQ - GAP1 promotes more frequent exchange of proteins present on plus ends to regulate actin filament assembly . Results IQGAP1 bundles and transiently caps actin filament plus - ends . We purified full length ( FL ) - IQGAP1 ( Figure 1A ) us - ing two affinity systems and directly tested its effect on actin assembly in total internal reflection fluorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy assays ( Figures 1B and S1A - C ; Movies 1 and 2 ) . Actin polymers in reactions containing IQGAP1 appeared sparse , short , and bundled compared to actin alone controls ( Figures 1B and S1C ) . Most concentrations of IQGAP1 had no effect on actin nucleation ( P = 0 . 79 ) ( Figures 1C and S1D ) . In contrast , all IQGAP1 concentra - tions used significantly slowed actin filament elongation from 10 . 2 ± 0 . 2 ( SE ) subunits s - 1 µM - 1 to 6 . 7 ± 0 . 3 ( SE ) subunits s - 1 µM - 1 ( P < 0 . 0001 ) ( Figures 1D and S1E ) . A closer examination of filaments in reactions containing IQGAP1 revealed significantly more stochastic pauses in Pimm et al . | bioR χ iv | May 5 , 2023 | 1 – 20 Figure 1 .

( G ) Frequency distribution plots of the duration of IQGAP1 capping events from reactions measured in D ( n = 75 filaments , and 31 - 70 pause events per condition , 331 pauses total measured ) . The mean duration of individual capping events was 20 . 6 s in the presence of IQGAP1 ( regardless of concentration ) . plus - end growth , lasting an average of 20 . 6 ± 1 . 9 ( SE ) s , regardless of concentration ( Figures 1E - G and S1F - I ; Movie 3 ) . Greater than 70 % of all filaments polymerized with IQGAP1 displayed capping events ( Figures 1F and S1F , S1H - I ) . Thus , IQGAP1 slows actin polymerization by transiently capping filament plus - ends ( Hoeprich et al . , 2022 ; Pelikan - Conchaudron et al . , 2011 ) . Notably , IQGAP1 purified by GST - affinity displayed dose - dependent changes in nucleation and plus - end dwell time ( Figure S1D , S1G , and S1I ) , which may indicate an effect of the GST - tag on IQGAP1 function . All further analyses were performed with proteins purified by His - affinity . IQGAP1 ( CD ) abrogates filament capping activity . The plus - end capping activity of IQGAP1 is associated with residues 745 - 1502 ( Hoeprich et al . , 2022 ; Pelikan - Conchaudron et al . , 2011 ) . We used truncation and mutational analyses with 75 nM protein to further delimit the region and residues important for plus end capping because it is sufficient for plus - end binding ( k D = 25 - 35 nM ) ( Hoeprich et al . , 2022 ; Pelikan - Conchaudron et al . , 2011 ) and filament pauses were obvious with the full - length protein ( Figures 1E , 2A , and S2A - G ; Movies 4 and 5 ) . IQGAP1 ( 745 - 1024 ) , containing four IQ motifs and the predicted dimerization domain , was the smallest truncation able to cap actin fila - ments ( Figures 2A - C and S2 ) . As this fragment was prone to degradation , we explored the contribution of each IQ motif with structurally disruptive mutations in IQGAP1 ( 745 - 1450 ) . All truncated IQGAP1 proteins that contained residues C756 and C781 capped filaments ( Figures 2A , 2C , and S2A - D ) . We generated alanine substitution mutants for these residues in IQGAP1 ( 745 - 1450 ) and in the full - length protein . The elongation rate of actin filaments polymerized in the presence of the truncated or full - length substitution mutant was equivalent to controls lacking IQGAP1 ( 7 . 0 ± 0 . 1 ( SE ) subunits s - 1 µM - 1 compared to 7 . 6 ± 0 . 1 subunits s - 1 µM - 1 ) ( P = 0 . 70 ) , and significantly faster than reactions performed with FL - IQGAP1 ( 5 . 8 ± 0 . 1 subunits s - 1 µM - 1 ) ( P < 0 . 0001 ) , indicating these mutations abolish IQGAP1 - mediated filament capping . Further , length traces of actin filaments polymerized with either capping - deficient ( CD ) IQGAP1 displayed uninterrupted polymerization ( Figures 2D and S2B ) and pauses to filament growth indistinguishable from reactions that contain only uncapped filaments lacking IQGAP1 ( Figures 2E and S2B - G ) ( P > 0 . 99 ) . IQGAP1 ( CD ) is a dimer that does not bind plus - ends . IQGAP1 ( CD ) appears to lack capping activity ( Figure 2 and S2 ) . However , measuring this activity from single - color actin assays does not rule out potential mechanisms 2 | bioR χ iv Pimm et al . | Coordination of actin dynamics Figure 2 .

IQGAP1 ( CD ) does not cap actin filaments shown by ( D ) filament length traces and ( E ) fre - quency plots of the duration of IQGAP1 - mediated pauses ( n = 75 filaments per condition ; n = 159 pauses for IQGAP1 ; n = 12 for IQGAP1 ( CD ) ) . where the alanine substitutions disrupt IQGAP1 oligomer - ization . To address this , we generated fluorescently labeled SNAP - tagged versions of IQGAP1 and IQGAP1 ( CD ) and used step - photobleaching analysis to determine the oligomeric state of single molecules of 649 - IQGAP1 or 488 - IQGAP1 ( CD ) each predominately exist as dimers ( Figure 3A - C ) . In multi - wavelength TIRF assays with polymerizing actin filaments , 649 - IQGAP1 molecules localized to filament plus - ends of actin filaments , as expected ( Figure 3D ; Movie 6 ) . However , the mean elongation rate of actin filaments actin filaments these reactions was significantly slower at 3 . 1 ± 0 . 3 ( SE ) subunits s - 1 µM - 1 , compared to actin alone controls ( P < 0 . 0001 ) , likely due to the direct visualization of end - localization events ( Figure 3D - F ) ( Hoeprich et al . , 2022 ) . In contrast , 488 - IQGAP1 ( CD ) protein showed rare interactions with filament ends ( Figure 3D and 3G ) and elongated at rates comparable to the actin alone control ( Figure 3E - F ) ( P = 0 . 81 ) . Molecules of either 649 - IQGAP1 or 488 - IQGAP1 ( CD ) were observed on the sides of actin filaments ( Figure 3H ) and each labeled construct displayed filament bundling activities ( Figure 3I ) . IQGAP1 and mDia1 ( ∆ DAD ) form complexes that pause actin filament elongation . IQGAP1 directly binds the formin , mDia1 , which nu - cleates and processively elongates actin filaments ( Figures 4A and S3A ) ( Brandt et al . , 2007 ; Chen et al . , 2020 ) . Biochemical evidence suggests these proteins may function antagonistically or influence additional actin filament end binding proteins that regulate filament assembly , like the formin - capping protein ‘decision complex’ ( Bombardier et al . , 2015 ; Funk et al . , 2021 ; Hoeprich et al . , 2022 ; Shekhar et al . , 2015 ) . We used TIRF microscopy assays to evaluate whether IQGAP1 - formin complexes bound to filament ends and to address related consequences for actin polymerization . We purified two constitutively active versions of fluores - cently labeled formin , 549 - mDia1 ( ∆ DAD ) , which retains the IQGAP1 binding site , and 549 - mDia1 ( FH1 - C ) , which does not ( Brandt et al . , 2007 ; Chen et al . , 2020 ) . Single - molecule assays that contained 549 - mDia1 ( ∆ DAD ) showed significantly more colocalization with either 649 - IQGAP1 or 488 - IQGAP1 ( CD ) , compared to 549 - mDia1 ( FH1 - C ) ( Figure 4B and 4C ) , as expected . Molecules of 549 - mDia1 ( ∆ DAD ) processively tracked the plus - ends of actin filaments ( Figure 4D ) ( Breitsprecher et al . , 2012 ; Kovar et al . , 2006 ) . We also observed the formation and dissolution of mDia1 ( ∆ DAD ) - IQGAP1 complexes at filament plus - ends ( Figure 4D - E and S3B - D ; Movie 7 ) , albeit rarely for 488 - IQGAP1 ( CD ) and likely mediated by formin ( Figure 4D ) . In the example shown ( Figure 4E ) , the actin filament grew at an average rate of ~ 10 subunits s - 1 µM - 1 , consistent with unassisted actin filament assembly ( Kovar et al . , 2006 ; Kuhn & Pol - lard , 2005 ; Liu et al . , 2022 ; Pimm et al . , 2022 ) . Upon association of a pre - formed mDia1 - IQGAP1 complex , filament growth stalled , with most pauses occurring for an average of 19 . 9 ± 2 . 4 s ( Figure S3E ) , despite the example shown . Eventually the complex dissociates and a molecule Pimm et al . | Coordination of actin dynamics bioR χ iv | 3 of 549 - mDia1 ( ∆ DAD ) rejoins the filament , growing 36 . 7 subunits s - 1 µM - 1 , consistent with formin - based filament assembly ( Breitsprecher et al . , 2012 ; Henty - Ridilla et al . , 2016 ; Kovar et al . , 2006 ; Vizcarra et al . , 2014 ) . Notably , stochastic pauses in formin - mediated actin filament growth occurred only when IQGAP1 could directly bind formin i . e . , 549 - mDia1 ( ∆ DAD ) , and were rarely observed for reac - tions performed with 549 - mDia1 ( FH1 - C ) or IQGAP1 ( CD ) ( Figure 4D - G ) . IQGAP1 influences ‘decision complexes’ by promot - ing dynamic exchange of plus - end molecules . IQGAP1 , mDia1 , and additional proteins competitively regulate actin filament plus - ends and produce vastly different consequences for filament length , assembly dynamics , and array architecture ( Courtemanche , 2018 ; Romet - Lemonne & Jégou , 2021 ; Shekhar et al . , 2016 ) . For example , mDia1 participates in an epic ‘tug - of - war’ with capping protein ( CP ) to decide the polymerization fate of individual actin filaments . The formin ‘wins’ when filament growth resumes ( CP dissociates ) , whereas formin ‘loses’ when CP evicts it from the plus - end resulting in no additional growth ( Bom - bardier et al . , 2015 ) . To address whether IQGAP1 influenced mDia1 - CP ‘decision complexes’ we performed bi - color actin TIRF assays ( Figure 5A ) . Actin filaments present in reactions containing buffer controls and capping - deficient IQGAP1 ( CD ) are predominately two colors , indicating that plus - ends are unobstructed ( Figures 5B - C and S4A ; Movie 8 ) . In contrast , actin filaments in reactions containing CP had a significantly higher percent of filaments that remained the original color ( pink ) ( P < 0 . 0001 ) , indicating capping events blocked the site of new monomer addition ( Figures 5B - C and S4A ; Movie 8 ) . The varied length of bi - color filaments present in the IQGAP1 reactions suggests that brief capping events occur ( Figures 5B and S4A ) . These reactions had more blocked ends than buffer controls ( P = 0 . 0002 ) , but significantly more free ends compared to reactions contain - ing CP ( P = 0 . 003 ) ( Figure 5C ) . Consistent with our single filament analysis , significantly more ends were blocked with the combination of IQGAP1 and mDia1 ( ∆ DAD ) ( P = 0 . 0132 ) ( Figures 4F , 5D - E , and S4B ; Movie 8 ) . Assays assessing the mDia1 ( ∆ DAD ) - CP ‘decision complex’ dis - played predominately blocked filament ends compared to actin alone controls ( P < 0 . 0001 ) or reactions containing CP alone ( P = 0 . 79 ) ( Figures 5F - G and S4C ; Movie 8 ) . Remarkably , the addition of IQGAP1 to either condition resulted in significantly fewer blocked ends ( P < 0 . 0001 ) , although significantly fewer free - ends compared to buffer controls ( P = 0 . 897 ) ( Figures 5F - G and S4C ; Movie 8 ) . To better understand how the combination of two capping factors ( e . g . , IQGAP1 and CP ) resulted in more free - ends , we turned to four - color single - molecule TIRF microscopy , directly visualizing non polymerizing actin filaments , IQ - GAP1 , mDia1 ( ∆ DAD ) , and CP at different fluorescent wave - lengths ( Figure 6A - B’ Movie 9 ) . We observed and mea - sured the lifetime of individual molecules alone or any com - Figure 3 . IQGAP1 ( CD ) is a dimer that does not cap actin filaments .

The half - life and be - havior of individual molecules of 649 - IQGAP1 ( n = 17 ) , 488 - mDia1 ( ∆ DAD ) ( n = 14 ) , or 549 - CP ( n = 2 ) or mDia1 - CP decision complexes ( n = 20 ) on filament ends was consistent with previous studies ( Figures 6C - D and S4D ) . We observed several IQGAP1 - CP complexes ( n = 7 ) that were displaced from plus - ends 8 - fold faster than individual molecules of CP alone ( Figures 6 and S4D ) . We also visualized several very short - lived ( ~ 27 s ) IQGAP1 - mDia1 - CP complexes ( n = 21 ) on plus - ends ( Figure S4D ) . Both the dwell time and half - life of these IQGAP1 - mDia1 - CP complexes were similar to the time that individual molecules of IQGAP1 were present on plus - ends , but drastically reduced compared to any combina - tion of CP or formin ( Figures 6D and S4D ) . Thus , not only does IQGAP1 transiently cap actin filaments , it also competi - tively displaces longer - lived decision complexes and individ - ual plus - end regulators > 18 - fold ! IQGAP1 capping activities are required for cell mor - phology and migration . Normal cell morphology and migration depends on IQGAP1 ( Brandt et al . , 2007 ; Choi et al . , 2013 ; Fukata et al . , 1997 ) . Thus , to test the importance of these activities in a more physiological setting , we generated two IQGAP1 CRISPR knock - out lines in NIH 3T3 cells ( Figure S5A ) . Loss of IQGAP1 significantly altered the morphology of these cells Pimm et al . | Coordination of actin dynamics bioR χ iv | 5 Figure 5 . IQGAP1 protects filament ends from Capping Protein ( CP ) .

These knockout phenotypes were rescued with a plasmid express - ing a full - length Halo - IQGAP1 construct ( P = 0 . 0449 ) , but not the Halo - IQGAP1 ( CD ) mutant ( P = 0 . 9999 ) , compared to Halo - IQGAP1 ) ( Figure 7A - D ) . The loss of IQGAP1 also significantly reduced cell migration in wound healing assays ( P < 0 . 0001 ) ( Figure 7E - F ) . Migration could be restored with Halo - IQGAP1 ( P = 0 . 0004 ) , albeit with some negative effects to cell - adhesion , but not with Halo - IQGAP1 ( CD ) ( P = 0 . 1199 , compared to Halo - IQGAP1 ) ( Figure 7E - F ) . These conditions did not significantly alter microtubule arrays ( Figure S5D - E ) , which suggests these phenotypes may be specific to actin - based IQGAP1 functions . Thus , IQGAP1 plus - end activities govern the actin dynamics required to regulate cell shape and movement . Discussion Actin polymerization is regulated by vastly different and often opposing classes of plus - end binding proteins and protein - protein complexes that stimulate , arrest , or pause fil - ament growth . This feature has remarkable consequences for cellular processes and behaviors , as plus - end protein proces - sivity dictates the physical properties and structural dimen - sions of cellular actin arrays ( Bombardier et al . , 2015 ; Bre - itsprecher & Goode , 2013 ; Efimova et al . , 2020 ; Funk et al . , 2021 ; Henty - Ridilla et al . , 2016 ; Hoeprich et al . , 2022 ; Shekhar et al . , 2015 ; Ulrichs et al . , 2023 ; Wirshing et al . , 2023 ) . Filament assembly is further complicated by disas - sembly factors and other proteins that effectively limit avail - able monomers necessary to assemble more filaments ( Pimm et al . , 2020 ; Pollard , 2016 ; Skruber et al . , 2018 ) . How this actin assembly paradox is resolved in cells remains unclear . Here we examine the role of IQGAP1 in actin filament as - sembly and identify two amino acids that are necessary for plus - end related activities . Our results suggest IQGAP1 is a displacement factor that rapidly exchanges formin , capping protein ( CP ) , and formin - CP complexes , which may promote more transitions of different plus - end proteins ( Figure 7G ) . This idea is reinforced in cells where IQGAP1 interactions with actin filament plus - ends are required for proper mor - phology and migration . Thus , IQGAP1 is part of a mecha - nism that may explain why cells require opposing and redun - dant factors to execute actin functions . Individual molecules of the formin mDia1 or CP each ex - hibit high affinity ( < 1 nM ) , long lived ( > 2000 s ) interactions 6 | bioR χ iv Pimm et al . | Coordination of actin dynamics Figure 6 .

As a ‘decision complex’ , mDia1 - CP has shorter interactions with filament plus ends ( 493 s ) . These dynamic interactions allow for quick transitions between periods of growth or fila - ment capping , to control actin filament length in actin - based structures like filopodia , stereocilia , or sarcomeres . IQGAP1 and mDia1 are high affinity binding partners with similar fea - tures to decision complexes ( Bartolini et al . , 2016 ; Brandt et al . , 2007 ; Chen et al . , 2020 ; Gaillard et al . , 2011 ) . Here we used formin mutants to show that both IQGAP1 and mDia1 can co - exist on filament plus - ends without binding each other or affecting formin - based activities . However , in situations where IQGAP1 was able to bind both mDia1 and filament plus - ends , the average formin - mediated assembly rate was reduced . However , unlike decision complexes , we never directly visualized molecules of mDia1 binding to fil - ament ends before IQGAP1 . Indeed , mDia1 joined IQGAP1 molecules already present on the plus end or IQGAP1 - mDia1 joined as a preformed complex . Based on affinities alone , it is unlikely IQGAP1 outcompetes mDia1 for these ends , but perhaps side - binding or sliding interactions ( below our detection limit ) keep IQGAP1 molecules near filament ends ( Bombardier et al . , 2015 ; Maufront et al . , 2022 ) . With 4 - color single - molecule assays we observed IQGAP1 - mDia1 - CP complexes on plus ends for an average of 27 s—18 - fold less than mDia1 - CP complexes . While the decision complex is a molecular “duel” or “tug - of - war” between mDia1 and CP , IQGAP1 seems to be a “decision factor” that determines the outcome by booting competitors off the plus end , effectively clearing the stage for the next battle . Previous studies characterized IQGAP1 as a transient cap - ping factor ( Hoeprich et al . , 2022 ; Pelikan - Conchaudron et al . , 2011 ) . Here we classify it as a displacement factor . In either situation , are these plus - end activities relevant in cells ? IQGAP1 is localized to sites of meticulous actin filament end regulation including filopodia ( Jacquemet et al . , 2019 ) , along stress fibers ( Samson et al . , 2017 ) , and at the leading edge ( Brandt et al . , 2007 ; Chen et al . , 2020 ) . The highest concen - tration of filament ends exists in the lamellipodium , which has an estimated 500 actin filaments per µm squared ( Abra - ham et al . , 1999 ; Raz - Ben Aroush et al . , 2017 ; Svitkina et al . , 1997 ) . Absent of plus - end factors , there would be 1 , 720 - 5 , 000 free ends in an average lamellipodium ( 1 µm × 10 µm × 0 . 2 µm ) ( Abraham et al . , 1999 ; Raz - Ben Aroush et al . , 2017 ; Svitkina et al . , 1997 ) . If we consider plus - end factors ( and assume they are all active ) , 1 , 200 ends will be occupied by CP ( 1 µM ) ( Pollard & Borisy , 2003 ) , < 60 ends will be oc - cupied by mDia1 dimers ( < 100 nM ) ( Chhabra et al . , 2009 ) , leaving as few as 460 free ends that could be occupied by 243 dimers of IQGAP1 . Considering IQGAP1 side - binding affinity ( 47 µM ) ( Mateer et al . , 2004 ) and other regulators that also bind these proteins , like twinfilin ( 602 molecules in this space ) ( Johnston et al . , 2018 ) or other formins like INF2 ( 180 dimers ) ( Chhabra et al . , 2009 ) , there may not be enough free ends to bind all the regulators . However , evidence indicates that multiple regulators co - occupy filament plus - ends and our work suggests that IQGAP1 indiscriminately joins several factors present there ( Brown & Sacks , 2006 ; Hedman et al . , 2015 ; White et al . , 2012 ) . This may explain how the IQ - GAP1 ( CD ) substitution mutant displayed significant pertur - bation to actin - based cell processes . Specifically , cells may not migrate as efficiently because formin - engaged filaments are overgrowing , and CP - subdued ends are being capped for too long . Intriguingly , IQGAP1 activities in cells are further regulated by calmodulin ( CaM ) and one of the two residues necessary for plus - end activities ( C756 ) is present at the pre - dicted binding site ( Pelikan - Conchaudron et al . , 2011 ; Zhang et al . , 2019 ) . Unraveling these molecular details provides a foundation for future studies to examine how additional plus - end regulators and IQGAP1 ligands further influence actin filament assembly .

In cells , IQGAP1 - filament capping activity may promote more turnover of molecules on filament plus - ends . of cDNA , plasmid construction , subcloning , site - directed mutagenesis , and plasmid sequencing was performed by Genscript ( Piscataway , NJ ) . Plasmid Construction . The coding sequence of full - length IQGAP1 ( UniProt : G3V7Q7 ) was synthesized with a silent basepair substitution ( c4485a ) to remove a native KpnI restriction site and cloned into a modified pET23b vector ( Pimm et al . , 2022 ) , flanked by AgeI and NotI sequences . IQGAP1 truncation mutants were subcloned into the same backbone or pET23b with a 5’ SNAP - tag using the same restriction sites . Amino acid sub - stitution mutations were generated in IQGAP1 ( 745 - 1450 ) or the full - length protein using site directed mutagenesis to create : IQ1 ( A754P , R757A , L760A ) , IQ1 - 2 ( A754P , R757A , L760A , Q783A , W786A , R787A , K790A ) , IQ3 ( H819A , R822A R826A ) , IQGAP1 ( CD ) ( C756A , C781A ) . To generate plasmids for mammalian cell expression , IQ - GAP1 and IQGAP1 ( CD ) sequences were inserted into a pCDNA - Halo vector ( Pimm et al . , 2022 ) via KpnI and NotI restriction sites . 6×His - tagged mDia1 ( ∆ DAD ) ( amino acids 1 - 1175 ) was synthesized and cloned into the pET23b vector flanked by AgeI and NotI restriction sites . Protein purification , labeling , and handling . All 6×His - tagged IQGAP1 proteins were expressed and purified using the same protocol as described for mDia1 constructs in Pimm et al 2022 . Briefly , proteins were 8 | bioR χ iv Pimm et al . | Coordination of actin dynamics expressed in Rosetta2 ( DE3 ) pRare2 cells ( Millipore Sigma , Burlington , MA ) and induced with 0 . 4 mM Isopropyl β - D - 1 - thiogalactopyranoside ( IPTG ) at 18 o C for 22 h . Cell pellets were resuspended in buffer ( 2× PBS ( 280 mM NaCl , 5 mM KCl , 20 mM sodium phosphate dibasic , 0 . 35 mM potassium phosphate monobasic , pH 8 . 0 ) , 500 mM NaCl , 0 . 1 % Triton - X 100 , 14 mM β - mercaptoethanol ( BME ) , 1 mg / mL DNase I , and 1× protease inhibitor cocktail ( 0 . 5 mg / mL leupeptin , 1000 U / mL aprotinin , 0 . 5 mg / mL pepstatin A , 0 . 5 mg / mL chymostatin , 0 . 5 mg / mL antipain ) ) , and lysed with 1 mg / mL lysozyme for 20 min and probe sonication at 100 mW for 90 s . Clarified lysates were applied to cobalt affinity columns ( Cytiva , Marlborough , MA ) , equilibrated in 1× PBS ( pH 8 . 0 ) , 500 mM NaCl , 0 . 1 % Triton - X 100 , 14 mM BME and eluted with a linear imidazole ( pH 7 . 4 ) gradient ( 0 - 300 mM ) . The 6×His - SUMO - tag was cleaved using 5 µg / mL ULP1 protease and the final protein was gel filtered over a Superose 6 Increase ( 10 / 300 ) column ( Cytiva ) equilibrated with 1× PBS ( pH 8 . 0 ) , 150 mM NaCl , 14 mM BME . Proteins were labeled in 10 - fold molar excess of SNAP - Surface dye ( New England Biolabs , Ipswich , MA ) in labeling buffer ( 1× PBS , 150 mM NaCl , 300 mM imidazole ( pH 8 . 0 ) , 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 , and 10 mM DTT ) for 1 h , then the 6×His - SUMO - tag was cleaved , and gel filtered as above . Pooled fractions were concentrated , aliquoted , flash frozen , and stored at - 80 o C until use . GST - tagged IQGAP1 in pGEX - 2T ( AddGene : 30107 ) was expressed ( as above ) and induced for 18 h at 18 o C . Clarified lysate was batch bound to 1 mL of glutathione agarose beads for 2 h , washed with nine column volumes of 2× PBS ( pH 8 . 0 ) , 500 mM NaCl , 0 . 5 mM DTT , and eluted in 2× PBS , 150 mM NaCl , 5 % glycerol , 0 . 1 % Triton - X 100 , 0 . 5 mM DTT , 15 . 3 mM glutathione . The GST - tag was removed with 44 µg / mL TEV protease , followed by gel filtration over a Su - perose 6 Increase ( 10 / 300 ) column ( Cytiva ) equilibrated with 1× PBS , 150 mM NaCl , 5 % glycerol , 0 . 1 % Triton - X 100 , 0 . 5 mM DTT . Purification of 6×His - mDia1 ( FH1 - C ) or 6×His - mDia1 ( ∆ DAD ) was conducted exactly as described for IQGAP1 or as we have purified previously ( Liu et al . , 2022 ; Pimm et al . , 2022 ) . Detailed purifications of untagged capping protein ( CP α 1 β 1 ; CP ) in pET3d or 6×His - SNAP - CP in modified pET3d ( Bombardier et al . , 2015 ; Johnston et al . , 2018 ; Soeno et al . , 1998 ) , profilin - 1 ( Liu et al . , 2022 ; Pimm et al . , 2022 ) , and labeled ( OG - maleimide ; Alexa - lysine ) and unlabeled rabbit muscle actin ( Cooper et al . , 1984 ; Kuhn & Pollard , 2005 ; Pimm et al . , 2022 ; Spudich & Watt , 1971 ) were described previously . Biotin - actin was purchased from Cytoskeleton , Inc ( Denver , CO ) . Protein concentrations were determined by densitometry of Coomassie gels compared to a BSA standard curve . La - beling efficiencies were calculated using spectroscopy and extinction coefficients : actin ε 290 , 25 , 974 M - 1 cm - 1 ; Oregon Green ( OG ) ε 496 , 70 , 000 M - 1 cm - 1 ; Alexa - 488 ε 495 , 73 , 000 M - 1 cm - 1 ; SNAP - 549 ε 554 , 140 , 300 M - 1 cm - 1 ; Alexa - 647 ε 650 , 203 , 000 M - 1 cm - 1 , and SNAP - 649 ε 655 , 250 , 000 M - 1 cm - 1 . Correction factors used were : OG , 0 . 12 ; Alexa - 488 , 0 . 11 ; SNAP - 549 , 0 . 12 ; Alexa - 647 , 0 . 03 ; and SNAP - 649 , 0 . 03 . The percent label for each SNAP - tagged protein is as follows : 549 - SNAP - IQGAP1 : 89 % ; 649 - SNAP - IQGAP1 : 87 % ; 488 - SNAP - IQGAP ( CD ) : 71 % ; 549 - SNAP - mDia1 ( FH1 - C ) : 57 % ; 549 - SNAP - mDia1 ( ∆ DAD ) : 66 . 5 or 70 % ; 549 - SNAP - CP : 70 % ; and 647 - SNAP - CP : 82 % . Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence ( TIRF ) mi - croscopy and related analyses . Coverslips were coated , imaging chambers were as - sembled , and TIRF microscopy was performed as previously described ( Henty - Ridilla , 2022 ) , with the following excep - tions : reactions were conducted with 0 . 36 % biotin - actin , at 20 o C , in : 20 mM imidazole ( pH 7 . 4 ) 50 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 10 mM DTT , 40 mM glucose , and 0 . 25 % methylcellulose ( 4000 cP ) . TIRF was performed using a DMi8 microscope equipped with 120 - 150 mW solid - state lasers , and a 100x Plan Apo 1 . 47 NA oil - immersion TIRF objective ( Leica Microsystems , Wetzlar , Germany ) . Images were captured using an iXon Life 897 EMCCD camera ( Andor ; Belfast , Northern Ireland ) with an 81 . 9 µm 2 field of view . Images were processed in FIJI ( Schindelin et al . , 2012 ) with a 50 - pixel rolling - ball radius background subtraction and 1 . 0 - pixel Gaussian blur . Actin assembly experiments were vi - sualized in 5 s intervals and dynamic parameters ( i . e . , nucle - ation and elongation rates ) were determined as previously de - scribed ( Henty - Ridilla , 2022 ) . Nucleation was assessed 200 s ( or 100 s in the supplement ) following the addition of actin to each reaction . The durations of filament capping events were measured from actin filament length over time plots . Frequency distributions were displayed as best - fit values of a Gaussian distribution : Y = ( A ) * ( e ( - 0 . 5 ) * ( ( x - | x | ) / SD ) 2 ) , where A is the amplitude of the peak and SD is the standard deviation of measured durations . For actin alone controls or capping de - ficient mutants , the data were not gaussian and best modeled as exponential decay : Y = ( Y 0 - D max ) * ( e ( - k * x ) + D max ) , where D max is the plateau and k is the exponential rate constant . The oligomeric state of IQGAP1 or IQGAP1 ( CD ) was measured from surface adsorbed 549 - IQGAP1 or 488 - IQGAP ( CD ) in TIRF buffer lacking glucose oxidase or cata - lase and recorded with continuous TIRF imaging at 75 % laser power with no neutral density filter . Stepwise reductions in integrated fluorescence of individual molecules were scored by hand and compared to mathematical predictions ( Breit - sprecher et al . , 2012 ) . Two - color TIRF movies of 647 - actin seeds , 1 µM poly - merizing actin ( either 20 % OG - label or 10 % 488 - label ; 3 . 6 nM ( 0 . 36 % ) biotin - label ) , and 5 nM 549 - IQGAP1 or 5 nM 488 - IQGAP1 ( CD ) were used to assess the localization to filament sides or ends over a 780 s period . Three - color TIRF movies of 1 µM actin ( 10 % 488 - label or 10 % 647 - label ; 3 . 6 nM biotin - label ) , 5 nM 549 - mDia1 ( ∆ DAD ) and 5 nM 649 - IQGAP1 , or 5 nM 549 - mDia1 and 5 nM 488 - Pimm et al . | Coordination of actin dynamics bioR χ iv | 9 IQGAP1 ( CD ) were similarly monitored over 1200 s . Colo - calization was determined from room temperature TIRF re - actions performed with 10 nM of each SNAP - labeled pro - tein following a 10 min incubation period . Individual molecules were detected using the ComDet v . 0 . 5 . 5 FIJI plu - gin ( https : / / github . com / ekatrukha / ComDet ) , with a detection threshold set to 3 pixels and a maximum threshold set to 5 pixels . The ratio of overlapping signal was divided by the total limiting molecules ( wavelength with the fewest total molecules ) and multiplied by 100 . Filament bundling was assessed by skewness parameter . Four - color TIRF movies were performed with 1 µM actin ( 30 % 405 - label and 3 . 6 nM ( 0 . 36 % ) biotin - label ) , 10 nM 488 - SNAP - mDia1 ( ∆ DAD ) , 10 nM 549 - SNAP - CP , and 10 nM 649 - SNAP - IQGAP1 . Single - molecules and complexes were identified with the ComDet plugin , then fluorescence signal was monitored for each channel until molecule dissociation . Values were auto - binned and half - life was determined from best - fit values of an expo - nential decay . Two - color actin experiments were performed by polymeriz - ing 647 - actin seeds ( 10 % 647 - label ; 3 . 6 nM biotin - label ) in TIRF chambers for 2 - 3 min . The chamber was washed thrice with TIRF buffer , and then the contents were replaced ( leav - ing only 647 - actin seeds ) with a new reaction mix comprised of 0 . 5 µM actin ( either 20 % OG - label or 10 % 488 - label ; 3 . 6 nM biotin - label ) and buffer or buffer and unlabeled pro - teins . Bicolor filaments and 647 - seeds were counted at 360 s and presented as the percent of 647 - seeds lacking 488 - actin ( blocked ends ) to the total number of 647 - seeds per 81 . 9 µm 2 . Cell growth , screening , and fixation . A pooled CRISPR knockout line and comparable wild - type NIH 3T3 cells expressing endogenous IQGAP1 were purchased from Synthego ( Redwood City , CA ) . Cells were grown in DMEM ( Gibco , Grand Island , NY ) supplemented with 10 % FBS ( Genesee Scientific , San Diego , CA ) , 200 mM L - glutamine ( Gibco ) , and 45 U / mL penicillin - streptomycin ( Gibco ) . All cell lines were screened for mycoplasma at regular intervals by screening fixed cells for irregular DAPI stain . Clonal lines were produced via dilution by plating 0 . 5 cells per 48 - well plate ( Genesee Scientific ) and visual confirmation of single - cell deposition . Wells containing cells were grown in conditioned media , grown to ~ 70 % confluency , and screened for protein levels via Western blots with monoclonal mouse anti - IQGAP1 ( 1 : 1000 ; 610612 , BD Biosciences , East Rutherford , NJ ) , polyclonal rabbit α - tubulin ( 1 : 2500 ; ab18251 , Abcam Inc , Cambridge , United Kingdom ) , and appropriate secondary antibodies ( 1 : 5000 IR - dye - 680 for IQGAP1 and IR - dye - 800 for α - tubulin ; LI - COR Biotechnology , Lincoln , NE ) . Blots were imaged with a LI - COR Odyssey Fc imaging system ( LI - COR Biotechnology ) . Cell morphology and wound healing assays . M - FN coverslips ( CYTOO Inc , Grenoble , France ) . Af - ter 30 min unattached cells were aspirated . IQGAP1 ( - / - ) cells were transfected for 16 h with 500 ng empty vector , Halo - IQGAP1 , or Halo - IQGAP1 ( CD ) plasmids using Lipo - fectamine 3000 using manufacturer’s instructions for 6 - well plates . Cells were washed thrice in 1× PBS , washed into 0 . 3 % glutaraldehyde and 0 . 25 % Triton X - 100 diluted in 1× PBS , and then fixed in 2 % glutaraldehyde for 8 min . Aut - ofluorescence was quenched with fresh 0 . 1 % ( w / v ) sodium borohydride prepared in 1× PBS for 7 min at room tempera - ture . Coverslips were washed twice with PBST ( 1× PBS and 0 . 1 % Tween - 20 ) supplemented with 1 % BSA , blocked for 1 h at room temperature , and coverslips were stained with anti - α - tubulin ( 1 : 250 ; ab18251 , Abcam ) overnight at 4 o C . Cells were washed three times with PBST and incubated for 1 h with AlexaFluor - 488 donkey anti - rabbit secondary ( 1 : 1000 ; A21206 , Invitrogen , Waltham , MA ) , and AlexaFluor - 568 phalloidin ( 1 : 500 ; Invitrogen ) . Coverslips were washed in 1× PBS and mounted in Aquamount ( Andwin Scientific , Schaumburg , IL ) . Coverslips were imaged by spinning disk confocal mi - croscopy on an inverted Nikon Ti2 - E microscope ( SoRa ; Nikon Instruments , Melville , NY ) equipped with 488 nm and 561 nm wavelength lasers , a Plan Apo 60× 1 . 4 NA oil - immersion objective , a CSU - W1 imaging head ( Yoko - gawa Instruments , Tokyo , Japan ) , a SoRa disk ( Nikon In - struments , Melville , NY ) , and a Prime BSI sCMOS cam - era with a pixel size of 6 . 5 µm / pixel ( Teledyne Photometrics , Tucson , AZ ) . Artificial intelligence denoise and 40 iterations of Richardson - Lucy deconvolution was applied to 7 – 10 µm Z - stacks acquired with Nikon Elements software . For mor - phology , and actin filament and microtubule arrays the total fluorescence signal ( pixel count ) threshold was set to satu - rated phalloidin - signal for morphology measurements , unsat - urated phalloidin - signal for actin filaments , and unsaturated and tubulin labeled images . Images were converted to 8 - bit grayscale , binarized , and measured as RawIntDen in Fiji soft - ware . For wound - healing assays , 100 , 000 cells were transfected for 12 h in 6 - well plates , replated following treatment with 100 µL 0 . 25 % trypsin for 1 min , diluted with 1 mL of fresh me - dia , and collected via centrifugation at 3000 x g for 3 min . Cells were gently resuspended in 200 µL of fresh media and transferred to each chamber ( 100 µL per well ) of a poly - mer coated 2 - well µ - dish ( Ibidi , Martinsried , Germany ) . Af - ter 3 h incubation the chamber inserts were removed ( time zero ) , the wound surface was washed thrice with warm Flu - orobrite DMEM ( Gibco ) buffered with 10 mM HEPES ( pH 7 . 4 ) . Cells were visualized with CellMask Green or DeepRed plasma membrane stain ( 1 : 1000 ; Invitrogen ) using the SoRa spinning disk described above , a Plan Apo 20× 0 . 75 . NA air objective , and 3 - 4 concurrent fields of view spanning the wound gap . Plates were washed into standard media and re - turned to the incubation chamber between timepoints . Tem - perature was maintained during imaging with a heated stage insert ( OKO labs , Pozzuoli , Italy ) . The image area occupied by cells was determined by tracing the area along the wound with the segmented line tool in FIJI . These outlines were used 10 | bioR χ iv Pimm et al . | Coordination of actin dynamics to generate a binary mask of cell occupancy .
