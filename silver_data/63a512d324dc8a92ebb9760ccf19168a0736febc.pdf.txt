Dissecting the roles of Rac1 activation and deactivation in macropinocytosis using microscopic photo - manipulation Makoto Fujii * { , Katsuhisa Kawai * , Youhei Egami & Nobukazu Araki Department of Histology and Cell Biology , School of Medicine , Kagawa University , Miki , Kagawa 761 - 0793 , Japan . Macropinocytosis , a fluid - phase endocytosis , is a crucial pathway for antigen uptake and presentation in macrophages . We attempted to characterise the activation and deactivation of a small GTPase molecular switch , Rac1 , in macropinocytosis using microscopic photo - manipulation . Expression of genetically encoded photoactivatable - Rac1 ( PA - Rac1 ) in RAW264 macrophages enabled the local , reversible control of macropinocytosis using blue laser irradiation . Marked membrane ruffling and unclosed pre - macropinosomes were observed in the irradiated region of macrophages under the persistent activation of PA - Rac1 . Although phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate and actin were also localised to this region , the recruitment of maturating endosome markers , such as phosphatidylinositol 3 - phosphate and Rab21 , was restricted until PA - Rac1 deactivation . After deactivating PA - Rac1 by ceasing irradiation , membrane ruffling immediately receded , and the macropinosomes acquired maturation markers . These data suggest that activation of Rac1 is sufficient to induce membrane ruffling and macropinocytic cup formation , but subsequent deactivation of Rac1 is required for macropinosome closure and further maturation . A ntigen - presenting cells , such as dendritic cells and macrophages , engulf extracellular fluid , including antigens , through macropinocytosis , a non - selective endocytic pathway 1 – 5 . Internalised antigens are processed , and antigenic peptides are loaded onto the major histocompatibility complex for T - cell presentation . Therefore , this pathway is critical to the immune system . In a paradoxical manner , numerous infectious pathogens , such as bacteria , viruses , protozoa and prions , utilise macropinocytosis for internalisation into host cells 2 – 4 . In addition , macrophage foam cell formation in atherosclerotic plaques can occur through the macropinocytic uptake of native low - density lipoprotein 6 . Given the physiological and pathological relevance of macropinocytosis , it is important to clarify the molecular mechanisms underlying this endocytic pathway in macrophages . At the onset of macropinocytosis , actin - based membrane protrusions , termed lamellipodia or membrane ruffles , are preferentially formed at the cell periphery . Some membrane ruffles curve to form circular cup - or pocket - shaped structures . These open cups , or pockets , close and pinch off from the plasma membrane to form relatively large vesicles ( greater than 0 . 2 m m diameter ) , referred to as macropinosomes , within a few minutes after circular ruffle formation 1 , 3 , 7 , 8 . Internalised macropinosomes show centripetal movement and progressive mat - uration upon the acquisition of early and late endocytic components . Macropinosomes eventually fuse with lysosomes , although some of these structures are recycled back to the plasma membrane . The macropinocytic pathway is typically completed within 20 min from its initiation in macrophages 5 , 8 , 9 . The elucidation of the molecular basis of macropinosome formation and maturation is receiving increasing interest 1 – 4 , 10 , 11 . The small GTPase Rac1 plays a crucial role in the formation of the initial membrane ruffles and macropinosomes . Activation of Rac1 induces actin polymerisation and subsequent lamellipodia formation in various cell types 12 , 13 . Overexpression of dominant active Rac1 ( Rac1G12V ) stimulates macropinocytosis in Rat - 1 fibroblasts 14 . However , microinjection of dominant negative Rac1 ( Rac1T17N ) into immature dendritic cells inhibits macropinosome formation 15 . In addition , overexpression of a constitutively active mutant form of p21 - activated kinase 1 ( PAK1 ) , a Rac1 effector , induces macropinosome formation , and overexpression of the PAK1 kinase autoinhibitory domain blocks both growth factor - and dominant active Rac1 ( Rac1Q61L ) - stimu - lated macropinocytosis 16 . However , these studies using dominant active or dominant negative mutants of Rac1 have not revealed how the activation / inactivation cycle of Rac1 affects macropinocytosis . Moreover , many experiments have focused on growth factor stimulation , which simultaneously induces numerous intracellular OPEN SUBJECT AREAS : ENDOCYTOSIS RHO SIGNALLING FLUORESCENCE IMAGING CONFOCAL MICROSCOPY Received 22 March 2013 Accepted 23 July 2013 Published 8 August 2013 Correspondence and requests for materials should be addressed to N .

SCIENTIFIC REPORTS | 3 : 2385 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / srep02385 1 signalling pathways ; therefore , it is unknown whether the activation of Rac1 is sufficient to induce macropinosome formation . Recently , Yoshida et al . investigated the relationship between Rac1 activation and macropinosome formation using ratiometric and fluorescence resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) microscopy in macrophages stimulated with macrophage colony - stimulating factor ( M - CSF ) and revealed that Rac1 is transiently activated during macropinosome formation 7 . The obtained FRET images implied that the spatiotemporal activation followed by deactivation of Rac1 might be important for coordinated process of macropinosome formation and maturation , although the significance of Rac1 deactivation has not been determined . To analyse the precise role of the spatiotemporal activation of Rac1 , which is a key regulator of actin polymerisation in cell migra - tion 12 , 13 , Wu et al . established photoactivatable - Rac1 ( PA - Rac1 ) , which is a fusion of a dominant active Rac1 with the light oxygen voltage ( LOV ) domain and following carboxy - terminal helical exten - sion ( J a ) of phototropin 1 , a protein light switch found in Avena sativa 17 , 18 . In the dark , the flavin - binding LOV domain interacts with J a and sterically hinders the interaction between Rac1 and down - stream effectors . Blue laser irradiation induces the dissociation of the LOV domain and J a to activate Rac1 . This photo - induced activation is reversible . Using this system , Wu et al . demonstrated that localised Rac activation was sufficient to generate cell motility and regulate the direction of cell movement 17 , 18 . To clarify the roles of Rac1 activation and deactivation in the coordinated process of macropinocytosis , we introduced PA - Rac1 into RAW264 macrophages . Photo - manipulation of PA - Rac1 using a 445 - nm laser enabled local control of membrane ruffling and macropinocytosis in live macrophages . Using this system , we demonstrated that markers of initial membrane ruffling and macro - pinocytic cups , such as phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) and actin , were detected upon activation of PA - Rac1 . However , the recruitment of maturating macropinosome markers was observed after the deactivation of PA - Rac1 . In this study , we have emphasized the importance of spatiotemporal regulation of Rac1 activation / deactivation for the progress of macropinocytosis . Results Local activation of PA - Rac1 reversibly induces membrane ruffling and macropinocytic cup formation . Several studies have suggested that Rac1 functions in membrane ruffling and macropinocytosis ; however , these studies primarily involved the use of dominant active or negative mutants of Rac1 14 , 15 . To elucidate the relationship between Rac1 activation / inactivation cycle and macropinosome formation , we introduced mCherry - fused PA - Rac1 into RAW264 macrophages . After confirming the expression of mCherry - PA - Rac1 based on mCherry signals , we irradiated the peripheral region of the cells using a 445 - nm laser during intervals of image acquisition and acquired phase - contrast images of live cells every 15 sec using confocal microscopy . Photoactivation of PA - Rac1 using a 445 - nm laser led first to cell surface membrane ruffling within a minute and then to formation of phase - bright bubble - like structures , which were presumably macropinocytic cups or macropinosomes , at the site of irradiation ( Fig . 1a and Supplementary Movie 1 ) . Typically , several bubble - like structures were formed 3 min after beginning photoac - tivation . The number of bubble - like structures increased with time during photoactivation ( Supplementary Table S1 ) . Depending on the individual cells , the initial membrane ruffles formed 1 – 5 min after photoactivation . This time lag might reflect the expression level of mCherry - PA - Rac1 or other downstream effector molecules of Rac1 in cells . We have tried different irradiation area sizes ranging from 50 to 200 m m 2 . However , the relationship between the irradiation area size and the number of bubble - like structures was undefined , since the number of formed bubble structures considerably varies from cell to cell . As for the location of irradiation , ruffling and bubble structures were formed only when the cell peripheral region was photoactivated . We could not see such structures in the cell central region upon photoactivated , although the reason remains unknown . After ceasing irradiation , the number of bubble - like structures was gradually reduced ( Supplementary Table S1 ) . Although numerous numbers of bubble - like structures ( 58 . 8 6 6 . 8 , n 5 6 ) had been accumulated in the cell peripheral region photoactivated for 15 min , a limited number of phase - bright vesicles ( 8 . 7 6 3 . 1 , n 5 6 ) remained 15 min after turning off PA - Pac1 activation ( Fig . 1b and Supplementary Movie 2 , Supplementary Table S1 ) . Many other bub - ble - like structures disappeared , probably by ruffle receding and / or vesicle recycling back to the plasma membrane as previously reported 5 , 8 . To confirm whether these phenomena were photoactivation dependent and repeatable , we moved the irradiation spot to a differ - ent position in the same cell . The membrane ruffles immediately receded from the initial irradiation area , but spherical vacuoles remained , and membrane ruffles were formed in the newly irradiated area ( Fig . 1c and Supplementary Movie 3 ) . Upon PA - Rac1 photo - activated , it was found that the local induction of membrane ruffling was accompanied by increased fluorescence signals of mCherry - PA - Rac1 . After the irradiation moving out , PA - Rac1 was gradually dis - sociated from the membranes of the spherical macropinosome - like structures ( Fig . 1c and Supplementary Movie 3 ) . Overexpression of a GDP - bound ( dominant negative ) mutant of PA - Rac1 ( PA - Rac1 T17N ) did not induce marked membrane ruff - ling or the formation of bubble - like structures after 445 - nm laser irradiation ( Supplementary Fig . S1 and Supplementary Movie 4 ) . This finding indicated that the morphological changes induced by 445 - nm laser irradiation are dependent on GTP - loaded Rac1 . Deactivation of Rac1 is required for efficient macropinosome closure . To determine whether the bubble - like structures formed by PA - Rac1 photo - manipulation are opened cups or closed vesicles , we added fluorescein dextran ( FDx ) , a fluid - phase probe , to the extracellular medium while photoactivating and incubated for 5 min , and then washed out with cold PBS . When we did not turn off the 445 - nm laser irradiation until FDx was washed out of the medium , FDx was faintly incorporated into intracellular vesicles ( Fig . 2a ) . Since FDx was released from bubble - like structures , it is likely that these structures were not closed . However , when we turned off the 445 nm irradiation 2 min before washing out , FDx remained in macropinosomes ; suggesting that these macropino - somes were closed after ceasing the photoactivation ( Fig . 2b ) . Furthermore , we quantified the rate of closed macropinosmes at different time points ( 0 min , 0 . 5 min , 2 min and 5 min ) after turning off the PA - Rac1 photoactivation . After confirming the formation of bubble - like structures by PA - Rac1 activation , we added cold PBS containing FM4 - 64 lipophilic dye ( which exhibits red fluorescence upon binding to the outer leaf of the plasma membrane ) to the extracellular medium without ceasing irradia - tion ( at time point 0 min ) . In this case , most of the bubble - like structures were labelled with the FM4 - 64 dye , suggesting that these structures maintained a connection with the plasma membrane ( Fig . 2c ) . Quantitation of bubble - like structures unlabelled with the FM dye indicated that only 6 . 5 6 1 . 8 % ( n 5 6 ) of bubble - like structures were closed macropinosmes ( Fig . 2d ) . However , when we added the FM4 - 64 dye at 0 . 5 min after ceasing irradiation , some vacuoles ( 35 . 4 6 5 . 4 % , n 5 9 ) were inaccessible to the FM 4 - 64 dye , suggesting that these structures are closed intracellular macropinosomes before adding the FM dye . The percentage of closed macropinosomes significantly ( P , 0 . 05 , Student’s t - test ) increased 0 . 5 – 2 min after ceasing the irradiation ( Fig . 2d ) . It was shown that 83 . 9 6 6 . 5 % ( n 5 6 ) of bubble - like structures were closed into macropinosomes 5 min after PA - Rac1 deactivation . ( Fig . 2c , d ) . Taken together , these data indicate that activation of www . nature . com / scientificreports SCIENTIFIC REPORTS | 3 : 2385 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / srep02385 2 PA - Rac1 is sufficient for the formation of membrane ruffles and bubble - like structures , which are connected to the cell surface , and subsequent PA - Rac1 deactivation is required for the efficient closure of macropinosomes . Because we found that the bubble - like structures are unclosed macropinocytic cups / pockets , we hereafter refer to these structures as pre - macropinosomes . Ultrastructural characterisation of the phenotype of persistent activation of Rac1 . To confirm the phenotype of persistent Rac1 activation , RAW264 cells were transfected with pCitrine - Rac1Q61L , a constitutively active Rac1 mutant , and serum - starved in RB for 2 hours before observation . By light microscopy , it was found that the Citrine - Rac1Q61L - expressing cells exhibited marked cell surface ruffling and bubble - like structures , while cells not expressing Citrine - Rac1Q61L lost membrane ruffles after 2 - hour serum starvation ( Supplementary Fig . S2 ) . When FM4 - 64 diluted in cold PBS was added to the extracellular medium , the membranes of the cell surface ruffles and bubble - like structures were immediately labelled with the lipophilic dye ( Fig . 3a ) . Therefore , these bubble - like structures seemed to be identical to the unclosed pre - macropino - somes observed in Fig . 2c of which PA - Rac1 was photoactivated . To further characterise the ultrastructural phenotype of persistent activation of Rac1 , RAW macrophages expressing Citrine - Rac1Q61L were fixed with 4 % glutaraldehyde and processed for scanning electron microscopy ( EM ) as previously described 11 . Based on the cell morphology observed by light microscopy ( Supplementary Fig .

At19 . 5 min , ruffleswere apparent within the irradiated region ( blue circle in the second panel ) . After 20 min , the irradiation was shifted to a different area of the same cell . After ceasing the irradiation , the ruffles immediately receded , and spherical macropinosomes were formed in the initial irradiation area ( broken - lined circle in the third panel ) . Instead , marked ruffling was induced in the new irradiated area ( blue circles in the third and fourth panels ) .

In Rac1Q61L expressing cells , multiple invaginations or caves were observed among the ruffles using scanning EM ( Fig . 3b ) . The opening of these caves at the cell surface suggests a failure of macropinosome closure under persistent Rac1 activation . Recruitment and activation of downstream effectors are locally induced after PA - Rac1 photoactivation . Next , we co - expressed Figure 3 | Observation of RAW264 cells expressing constitutively active mCitrine - Rac1Q61L by fluorescence and scanning electron microscopy .

Upon laser irradiation at 445 nm , we detected accumulation of Citrine - PBD around the irradiated area where the formation of membrane ruffles and pre - macropinosomes was observed ( Fig . 4a ) . These findings indicate that irradiation substantially activated PA - Rac1 to bind downstream effectors and recruit effector molecules to the region . Phosphoinositides , such as PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , are key regulators of the actin cytoskeleton and membrane trafficking 19 – 21 . We have prev - iously shown that PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is predominately localised to membrane ruffles and macropinocytic cups 22 . Because Rac1 activates phospha - tidylinositol 4 - phosphate 5 - kinase ( PIP5K ) , which produces PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 23 , 24 , the level of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 could be elevated upon the PA - Rac1 activation . To confirm this possibility , we co - transfected mCherry - PA - Rac1 with a YFP - fused phospholipase C - d 1 pleckstrin homology domain ( YFP - PLC - PH ) , which specifically binds PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . As expected , live - cell imaging of YFP - PLC - PH demon - strated increased PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels in membrane ruffles and pre - macropinosomes during PA - Rac1 photoactivation ( Fig . 4b and Supplementary Movie 5 ) . Actin assembly and disassembly can be controlled by photo - manipulation of PA - Rac1 . Actin reorganisation is an essential step in the formation of membrane ruffles and macropinosomes 1 – 4 , 12 , 13 . To analyse actin dynamics during PA - Rac1 - induced membrane ruffling and macropinosome formation , we co - expressed mCherry - PA - Rac1 with YFP - b - actin . We observed that YFP - b - actin was predominantly associated with the membrane ruffles and pre - macropinosomes Figure 4 | Local PA - Rac1 activation recruits the PBD of Pak1 and induces PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 production .

The bar indicates 5 m m . www . nature . com / scientificreports SCIENTIFIC REPORTS | 3 : 2385 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / srep02385 5 ( Fig . 5a and Supplementary Movie 6 ) . Quantification of the YFP signal intensity confirmed the accumulation of YFP - b - actin in the photoactivated area ( Fig . 5c ) . After ceasing blue laser irradiation to deactivate PA - Rac1 , the membrane ruffles and YFP - b - actin signal disappeared from this area ( Fig . 5b , c and Supplementary Movie 7 ) . Thus , actin assembly and disassembly can be controlled by the local photo - manipulation of PA - Rac1 , probably through the production of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and actin - binding proteins . PI ( 3 ) P is scarcely recruited to areas where PA - Rac1 is persistently activated . Internalised macropinosomes sequentially acquire early and late endosome markers and eventually fuse with tubular lysosomes in macrophages 9 , 25 , 26 . Phosphatidylinositol 3 - phosphate ( PI ( 3 ) P ) primarily localises to early endosomes 20 , 21 and serves as a binding platform for early endosome proteins , such as early endo - some antigen 1 ( EEA1 ) and sorting nexins through FYVE and Phox homology ( PX ) domains , respectively 3 . During the normal course of macropinocytosis , PI ( 3 ) P accumulates on macropinosomes after 10 – 20 min 7 , 27 , 28 . To analyse the impact of PA - Rac1 activation on PI ( 3 ) P levels , we overexpressed mCherry - PA - Rac1 with Citrine - FYVE , which specifically detects PI ( 3 ) P . Prior to PA - Rac1 photoactivation , Citrine - FYVE was primarily localised on small early endosomes . During persistent activation of PA - Rac1 by repeated blue laser irradiation , many pre - macropinosomes ( 60 . 5 6 7 . 8 , n 5 6 ) accumulated in the irradiated area ; however , 89 . 1 6 3 . 5 % ( n 5 6 ) of these structures were negative for Citrine - FYVE even after 20 min ( Fig . 6a and Supplementary Movie 8 ) , suggesting that the persistent activation of PA - Rac1 does not induce elevation of PI ( 3 ) P levels . Curiously , after transient activation of PA - Rac1 by a 5 - min pulse of blue laser irradiation , newly formed macropinosomes efficiently acquired PI ( 3 ) P ( Fig . 6b and Supplementary Movie 9 ) . The number of pre - macropinosomes formed by 5 - min pulse photoactivation was much less ( 22 6 7 . 1 , n 5 4 ) than that by 20 - min persistent photo - activation , however , 75 . 2 6 12 . 1 % ( n 5 4 ) of formed pre - macropi - nosmes became positive for Citrine - FYVE 10 min after ceasing photoactivation , similar to the normal course of macropinocytosis . This finding implies that Rac1 deactivation after transient activation of Rac1 is important for the maturation of early macropinosomes . The deactivation of Rac1 is crucial for the progress of macropino - some maturation or recycling . We have previously demonstrated that Rab21 predominantly localises to macropinosomes from early Rab5 - positive to late Rab7 - positive stages , and active Rab21 is not required for macropinosome formation , but implicated primarily in macropinosome maturation 25 . Since GFP - Rab21 was more predomi - nantly localised to macropinosmes than Rab5 or Rab7 25 , we employed Rab21 as a marker of macropinosome maturation to determine the significance of Rac1deactivation in macropinosome maturation . While photoactivation of PA - Rac1 induced pre - macropinosome formation in cells co - expressing PA - Rac1 and GFP - Rab21 , few of them ( 6 . 4 6 1 . 8 % , n 5 6 ) were GFP - Rab21 - positive under the persistently active ( . 15 min ) of PA - Rac1 ( Fig . 7a and Supplementary Movie 10 ) . When we ceased photoac - tivation of PA - Rac1 , the total number of pre - macropinosomes and / or macropinosomes was reduced with time . At this stage , many of the pre - macropinosomes receded without forming macropinosomes . Some of the sustained macropinosomes migrated toward the perinuclear region , and these motile macropinosomes showed membrane localisation of GFP - Rab21 signals ( Fig . 7b and Supple - mentary Movie 11 ) . In contrast , the percentage of Rab21 - positive macropinosomes markedly increased ( 78 . 6 6 6 . 8 % , n 5 6 ) after 10 min . These data suggest that deactivation of Rac1 may be required for the transition from pre - macropinosomes to maturat - ing macropinosome . Discussion Many previous studies have used dominant active or negative mutants of Rac to elucidate the relationship between Rac activity and cellular events 14 , 15 . However , these mutants are not suitable tools for analysing the physiological function of Rac1 as a molecular switch , since the effects of mutant expression are irreversible and global in the cell . Therefore , we utilised PA - Rac1 , which is reversibly activated by blue laser irradiation 17 , 18 , to investigate the relationship between the activation / deactivation of Rac1 and macropinosome formation and maturation . Using this advantageous technique , we were locally able to induce membrane ruffling and macropinosome formation . Markers of initial membrane ruffle and macropinocytic cup formation , such as PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and actin 22 , were detected on these structures before PA - Rac1 deactivation , but acquisition of Rab21 , a macropinosome maturation marker 25 , was observed only after Rac1 deactivation . Moreover , the persistent activation of PA - Rac1 sup - pressed macropinosome internalisation and induced the accumula - tion of pre - macropinosomes at the cell periphery , where laser irradiation was repeatedly applied for more than 20 min . Taken together , these data suggest that activation of Rac1 is sufficient for membrane ruffles and macropinocytic cups to form , whereas deac - tivation of Rac1 is required for the efficient closure of macropino - somes and further maturation and / or recycling . Using FRET microscopy , Yoshida et al . vigorously investigated the timing of Rac1 activation during macropinosome formation and maturation in M - CSF - stimulated macrophages 7 . They divided macropinocytosis into four stages based on cell morphology , char - acterised by the formation of irregular ruffles , curved ruffles , circular ruffles and motile macropinosomes , and showed that Rac1 is tran - siently activated after circular ruffle formation . Based on these data , these authors concluded that transient Rac1 activation induces cup closure for isolated macropinosome formation . Our data consis - tently showed that the deactivation of Rac1 following activation was important for efficient cup closure . Our fluid - phase uptake observations using FDx and quantitation of macropinosome closure using FM4 - 64 membrane labelling ( Fig . 2a - d ) clearly revealed that the bubble - like macropinocytic structures formed under the persist - ent activation of PA - Rac1 were open to extracellular medium , whereas after deactivation of Rac1 , these structures closed to form intracellular vesicles . Inconsistent with the data obtained in the present study , it was previously shown that a constitutively active mutant of Rac1 enhanced macropinosome formation 14 . However , this previous study did not address the effect of the deactivation of Rac1 . Our analysis of RAW macrophages overexpressing constitutively active Rac1 by fluorescence microscopy using FM4 - 64 dye and scanning EM revealed that the bubble - like structures are primarily pre - macro - pinosomes connected to the cell surface . This phenotype is similar to that of PA - Rac1 - expressing cells when persistently photoactivated . During constitutive or growth factor - induced macropinocytosis , macropinosomes are sustained for minutes and gradually diminishes associated with homotypic fusion and / or recycling back to the plasma membrane 7 , 8 , 22 , 27 – 29 . In contrast , under the persistent activa - tion of PA - Rac1 , many pre - macropinosomes accumulate over time at the cell periphery , and few of them acquired the early endosome markers PI ( 3 ) P and Rab21 . Then after the deactivation of PA - Rac1 , pre - macropinosomes gradually disappeared , and a population of these structures acquired Rab21 . These Rab21 - positive vesicles were typically sustained for a long period , showing centripetal movement toward the perinuclear region . This population might reflect mat - urating macropinosomes . This finding is consistent with previous results showing that some macropinosomes mature , while others are recycled back to the plasma membrane 5 , 8 – 10 , 22 . These data also suggest that deactivation of Rac1 is required not only for the closure of macropinosomes , but also for the recruitment of molecules which may mediate the maturation of macropinosomes . What are the upstream activators and the downstream effectors of Rac1 during the macropinosome formation under physiological con - dition ?

However , the upstream activators of Rac1 during constitutive macropinocytosis in scavenger cells , such as neutrophils , dendritic cells and macrophages , remain unknown . Several molecules have been suggested as downstream effectors of Rac1 during macropinosome formation , such as PAK1 . The overex - pression of a constitutively active PAK1 mutant induces macropino - some formation , and overexpression of the PAK1 kinase autoinhibitory domain blocks both growth factor and dominant active Rac1 ( Rac1 Q61L ) - stimulated macropinocytosis 16 . PAK1 also phos - phorylates C - terminal binding protein 1 of the E1A / brefeldin A ADP ribosylated substrate ( CtBP / BARS ) , a component of the mem - brane fission machinery , and this phosphorylation is critical for fission of the macropinocytic cup 30 , 31 . Another candidate molecule , WAVE / Scar1 , which interacts with and activates the Arp2 / 3 complex 32 , acts downstream of Rac1 and links Rac1 signalling to actin reorganisa - tion 33 , 34 . Rac1 activation stimulates the production of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 by PIP5K and promotes actin polymerisation through the activation of actin - binding proteins 23 , 24 , 35 . We have consistently shown that PA - Rac1 activation locally elevates the level of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and induces the accu - mulation of actin filaments at the cell periphery under blue laser irra - diation . We have previously shown that the level of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 increases during the formation of membrane ruffles and macropinocytic cups , but PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is eliminated when macropinocytic cups close to form macropinosomes 22 . In addition , actin filaments were observed to be disassembled from the bottom of the macropinocytic cups . This sug - gested that elimination of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is required for actin filament disassembly and macropinosome closure , suggesting that Rac1 deac - tivation is necessary for the efficient closure of macropinosomes . The photo - manipulation of PA - Rac1 in RAW264 macrophages enabled us to characterise the role of the Rac1 molecular switch in the dynamic process of macropinocytosis . This study is the first to show that macropinosome formation can be controlled in live cells by the temporal modulation of a light activatable engineered molecular switch using a conventional confocal laser microscope . This app - roach could also be used to examine the relationship between Rac1 activation / deactivation and other signalling molecules involved in other cell functions . Methods Chemicals and plasmids . Fluorescein isothiocyanate - dextran , molecular weight 10 , 000 ( FDx ) , and FM4 - 64 were purchased from Molecular Probes ( Eugene , OR ) . pTriEx / mCherry - PA - Rac1Q61L and pTriEx / mCherry - PA - Rac1 T17N 17 , 18 were obtained from Addgene . Dr . Joel A . Swanson ( University of Michigan ) kindly provided pCitrine / PBD 7 , pCitrine - FYVE 7 , pCitrine - Rab5a 7 , pmCitrine - Rac1Q61L , and pYFP - PLC - PH . Dr . Arwyn T . Jones ( EMBL ) kindly donated pGFP - Rab21 25 . The XhoI / BamHI fragments of pAcGFP - b - actin ( Clontech ) were introduced into the same sites of pEYFP - C1 to produce pEYFP - b - actin . Cell culture and transfection . RAW264 mouse macrophage cells ( Riken Cell Bank , Tsukuba , Japan ) were grown in DMEM containing 10 % foetal bovine serum ( FBS ) supplemented with 100 U / ml of penicillin and 0 . 1 mg ml 2 1 streptomycin . The cells weremaintainedat37 u Cinahumidified5 % CO 2 incubator . Plasmidtransfectionwas performed using the Neon TM transfection system ( Invitrogen ) following the manufacturer’s protocol . Briefly , 100 m l of a RAW264 cell suspension ( 1 . 0 3 10 7 cells / ml ) in buffer R was mixed with 1 . 0 – 3 . 0 m g of the indicated plasmids and electroporated once at 1 , 680 V for 20 ms . The cells were then seeded onto 25 - mm circular coverslips in a 35 - mm culture dish containing 2 ml of culture medium . At 12 – 24 hours after transfection , the cells were subjected to live cell imaging . Photoactivation of PA - Rac1 , live cell imaging and data analysis . Transfected RAW264 cells were washed once using pre - warmed Ringer’s buffer ( RB ) [ 10 mM Hepes - NaOH ( pH 7 . 2 ) , 155 mM NaCl , 5 mM KCl , 2 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 10 mM D - glucose and 0 . 5 mg / ml bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) ] and assembled in an RB - filled Attofluor cell chamber ( Molecular Probes ) on the thermo - controlled stage ( Tokai Hit . , Shizuoka , Japan ) . Photoactivation of PA - Rac1 and live cell imaging were performed using anAxio observer Z1 inverted microscope equippedwithalaserscanningunit ( LSM700 , Zeiss ) andPlan - Apochromat63x / N . A . 1 . 4 lens under the control of ZEN2009 software ( Zeiss ) . To photoactivate the PA - Rac1 , the indicated area of RAW264 cells expressing mCherry - PA - Rac1 was repeatedlyirradiatedusinga5 mW445 - nmlaserat1 . 0 – 3 . 0 % powerfortheindicated intervals of image acquisition . Live cell images were acquired every 15 sec using a 10 mW 488 - nm laser at 0 . 5 – 1 . 0 % power to obtain GFP , YFP or Citrine images or a 10 mW 555 - nm laser at 0 . 5 – 2 . 0 % power to obtain mCherry and bright - field phase - contrast or DIC images . The presented image data are representative of at least four independent experiments . To determine whether bubble - like structures formed by PA - Rac1 photo - manip - ulation are closed or opened , we added 0 . 5 mg ml 2 1 fluorescein dextran ( FDx , MW 10 , 000 , Molecular Probe ) to the extracellular medium , incubated for 5 min , washed withcoldPBS , andthenimmediatelyacquiredphase - contrastandFDximages . Inone experiment , photoactivation was not stopped until FDx was washed out of the mediumwithcoldPBS . Inanotherexperiment , photoactivationwasturnedoff2 min before washing with PBS . To identify unclosed macropinocytic cups / pockets , a lipophilic plasma membrane marker , FM4 - 64 ( Molecular Probes ) diluted in cold PBS was added to the extracel - lular medium at a final concentration of 5 . 0 m g ml 2 1 at different time points ( 0 min , 0 . 5 min , 2 min and 5 min after photoactivation ) . Fluorescence images of FM 4 - 64 were acquired immediately ( , 1min ) after the FM4 - 64 addition by a confocal laser microscope with 488 nm excitation and 515 6 20 nm emission . Quantitation of macropinosome closure was carried out by scoring the numbers of FM4 - 64 - negative macropinosomes and FM4 - 64 - positive pre - macropinosomes in the cell . The per - centage of FM4 - 64 - negative closed macropinosomes was calculated . To monitor macropinosome formation and the expression of initial macropino - cytic markers , such as actin and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , pYFP - actin or pYFP - PLC - d 1 - PH domain was co - transfected with pTriEx / mCherry - PA - Rac1Q61L . To monitor macropino - some maturation , Citrine - FYVE or pGFP - Rab21 was co - expressed with mCherry - PA - Rac1 . To quantify the level of YFP - b - actin in the photoactivated area , the fluorescence signal intensity ratio was calculated . Briefly , the fluorescence signal intensitiesfromtwodifferentareas ( photoactivatedareaandcontrolarea ) intheYFP - b - actin images were measured using ZEN2009 software , and their ratio ( % of the control ) was calculated . The control area which was independent of photoactivation was the same size as the experimental area in the same cell . Statisticalanalysis . Dataarepresentedasmean 6 standarderror ( SE ) forthenumber of experiments indicated in the legends and / or text . Statistical significance was determined bytwo - tailedunpaired Student’s t - test . Differences betweentheanalyzed samples were considered significant at p , 0 . 05 . Scanning electron microscopy . RAW264 cells transfected with pmCitrine - fused Rac1Q61L were cultured on cover slips and serum starved for 2 hours . After confirming marked membrane ruffling in Rac1Q61L - expressing cells using fluorescence and phase - contrast microscopy , the cells were fixed with 4 % glutaraldehyde in 0 . 1 M phosphate buffer , pH 7 . 4 , for 1 hour at 4 u C . The specimens were post - fixed with 1 % OsO 4 , treated with 1 % tannic acid and processed for scanning EM as previously described 11 . The critical point - dried cells were coated using an osmium plasma coater ( OPC40 , Nippon Laser & Electronics ) and observed with a Hitachi S900 SEM at 6 kV . 1 . Swanson , J . A .
