ARTICLE Spontaneous polarization and cell guidance on asymmetric nanotopography Corey Herr 1 , Benjamin Winkler 2 , Falko Ziebert 3 , Igor S . Aranson 4 , John T . Fourkas 5 , 6 & Wolfgang Losert 1 , 6 ✉ Asymmetric nanotopography with sub - cellular dimensions has recently demonstrated the ability to provide a unidirectional bias in cell migration . The details of this guidance depend on the type of cell studied and the design of the nanotopography . This behavior is not yet well understood , so there is a need for a predictive description of cell migration on such nano - topography that captures both the initiation of migration , and the way cell migration evolves . Here , we employ a three - dimensional , physics - based model to study cell guidance on asymmetric nanosawteeth . In agreement with experimental data , our model predicts that asymmetric sawteeth lead to spontaneous motion . Our model demonstrates that the nanosawteeth induce a unidirectional bias in guidance direction that is dependent upon actin polymerization rate and sawtooth dimensions . Motivated by this model , an analysis of pre - viously reported experimental data indicates that the degree of guidance by asymmetric nanosawteeth increases with the cell velocity . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s42005 - 022 - 00889 - 0 OPEN 1 Department of Physics , University of Maryland , College Park , MD , USA . 2 Physikalisch - Technische Bundesanstalt , Berlin , Germany . 3 Institute for Theoretical Physics , Heidelberg University , Heidelberg , Germany . 4 Department of Biomedical Engineering , Pennsylvania State University , University Park , PA , USA . 5 Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry , University of Maryland , College Park , MD , USA . 6 Institute for Physical Science and Technology , University of Maryland , College Park , MD , USA . ✉ email : wlosert @ umd . edu COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS | ( 2022 ) 5 : 114 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s42005 - 022 - 00889 - 0 | www . nature . com / commsphys 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 89 0 ( ) : , ; M ost cells produce motion through the coupling of the actin cytoskeleton and the cell membrane to the sur - rounding substrate . In vivo , cell guidance is affected by a variety of external and internal stimuli , including the extra - cellular matrix ( ECM ) 1 , surface rigidity 2 , chemical gradients 3 , and nanotopography . Local nanotopography has a substantial effect on cell behavior . For instance , it has been reported that nanoto - pographic substrates can lead to cell guidance and can in ﬂ uence cell morphology 4 – 7 . Nanoridges can lead to the bidirectional contact guidance of cells , causing cells to speed up and elongate parallel to ridges 8 . In vivo environments are often asymmetric 9 , 10 , in the form of the porous ECM . Such asymmetries are not often considered in modeling cell migration . Asymmetric nanotopo - graphic substrates have recently been shown to lead to a uni - directional bias in cell migration , with a preferred guidance direction that depends on both the details of the nanotopgraphy 11 and cell line 12 . Physical modeling has been highly successful in describing cell migration , allowing for the creation of conceptually simple , whole - cell models with wide - reaching implications 13 – 24 . Much of the previous modeling of cell migration has focused on cells on ﬂ at surfaces . However , the contact - guidance experiments dis - cussed above suggest that the topography encountered in 3D , in vivo environments can have a profound effect on cell migra - tion . We have previously developed a model that successfully captures some aspects of migration on nanotopographic substrates 25 . Here we extend this model to rows of asymmetric nanosawteeth . The cell is modeled as a deformable boundary in which actin polymerizes at the front , forming lamellipodia and pushing the cell boundary outward . This extended model reproduces the key qualitative aspects of cell motility on asym - metric nanotopography . Our work reveals that on asymmetric , nanoscale sawteeth , cells exhibit spontaneous onset of motion and directed guidance . For a cell in a deterministic model to move on a ﬂ at substrate , the cell must initially be polarized 13 , 16 , 19 , 25 . However , when the same cell model is implemented on asymmetric nanotopography , sponta - neous cell polarization is observed . In agreement with previous experimental results 11 , 12 , our model exhibits biased unidirectional motion on asymmetric nanosawteeth , and exhibits a guidance direction that is dependent upon both the details of the nano - topography and actomyosin dynamics . Our model reproduces qualitative cell - shape phenotypes observed experimentally , including cell elongation parallel and perpendicular to the gui - dance direction , depending upon the parameters of the nanoto - pography and the cells . The model also predicts that the degree of guidance by asymmetric sawteeth depends on cell velocity . This prediction is supported by a re - analysis of previous experimental data . Results Phase - ﬁ eld model . To explore cell migration on nanotopography , we extended a 3D phase - ﬁ eld model that was originally developed to model cells in con ﬁ ned environments 25 . This model uses two dynamical variables to describe the state of the cell . The ﬁ rst , ρ ( r , t ) , is a scalar phase - ﬁ eld that describes the cell boundary and assumes values between 0 and 1 . The cell boundary lies at ρ = 1 / 2 , with ρ > 1 / 2 inside the cell and ρ < 1 / 2 outside of the cell . The second is a 3D vector ﬁ eld p ( r , t ) . The direction of p gives the orientation of the actin ﬁ laments and the magnitude of p gives the ordering of the ﬁ laments . As in the previous 3D phase - ﬁ eld model 25 , we describe the substrate using two auxiliary ﬁ elds : Φ ( r ) is a steric ﬁ eld that models the volume exclusion of the cell and the substrate and Ψ ( r ) restricts actin generation to occur close to the surface . The modeling framework is described by two coupled equations for ρ and p , as detailed in the “ Methods ” section . In the equations , the unit of length is 1 μ m and the unit of time is 10 s . Here we study the effect of three model parameters on guided cell migration and cell shape . The ﬁ rst , β , is the actin polymerization rate , which determines how fast actin polymerizes at the surface of the cell . The second , θ , determines the preferred angle of actin polymerization with respect to the local substrate geometry . When far away from the substrate , actin polymerizes normal to and away from the local cell membrane . Near the substrate , θ determines the component of actin polymerization normal to the substrate . For θ = 0 , actin polymerizes tangentially to the local substrate , whereas for θ = 1 the normal and tangential polymerization rates are equal . The third parameter , σ , deter - mines the rate of acto - myosin contraction . A larger value of σ represents more acto - myosin contraction in the cell . Collectively , these parameters can describe a wide variety of cell migration and shape phenotypes 25 . Asymmetric nanotopography causes spontaneous polarization . We studied cell dynamics on an array of in - registry rows of asymmetric sawteeth , in which both the sawteeth and the spa - cings between rows were of subcellular dimensions ( Fig . 1a ) . Such sawteeth have been shown experimentally to be able to bias cell guidance unidirectionally . Sun et al . 11 reported that different nanosawtooth heights lead to opposite guidance directions of Dictyostelium discoideum . Furthermore , Chen et al . 12 reported that the different cell lines were guided in opposite directions on D o w n S a w t e e t h D o w n S a w t ee t h Time a b e c f d Fig . 1 Asymmetric sawteeth and dominant phenotypes . a Zoomed - in schematic of the array of asymmetric sawteeth used in the phase - ﬁ eld model .

For this study , the sawtooth height was varied between 0 . 75 μ m and 2 μ m and the sawtooth length was varied between 2 . 5 μ m and 6 μ m . We investigated how this nanotopography affects the onset of cell migration and the corresponding migration and shape phenotype evolution by placing a single cell on the substrate , without initial polarization , and observing the subsequent dynamics . The model produces two major cell - shape phenotypes . The crescent phenotype ( Fig . 1b ) is representative of cells that are more contractile , such as the M4 cell line that has been studied on asymmetric sawteeth 12 . The wedge phenotype ( Fig . 1c ) is representative of cells on the lower end of the contractility spectrum , such as D . discoideum , which has also been studied on asymmetric sawteeth 11 . Supplementary Movie 1 shows a model cell transitioning from the crescent to the wedge phenotype . Spontaneous polarization is not observed in phase - ﬁ eld models of cells on ﬂ at substrates because the resting state is stable . Thus , the cells in this situation cannot migrate without inducing polarization either externally 26 or via initial conditions 13 , 27 . However , the asymmetry of the substrates studied here allows cells to generate propulsion even in the absence of an initial polarization . The polarization occurs because the cell adheres to the asymmetric surface , which causes a break in the directional symmetry of actin polarization . Figure 1d shows the polarization vector ﬁ eld for a cell that is polarized spontaneously by sawteeth . There are points of strong polarization underneath the cell that has a tangential component up the sawteeth ( against the net direction of cell motion ) . However , there is strong enough polarization at the leading edge of the cell to propel the cell forward . This cell moves spontaneously with θ = 0 . Therefore , the impetus for spontaneous motion on sawteeth is actin polymer - ization tangential to the substrate . In this model , a cell can only move spontaneously down the sawteeth ( Fig . 1e ) or at an angle to the sawteeth ( Fig . 1f ) . The direction of cell guidance is in ﬂ uenced by actin poly - merization . In experiments with cells on asymmetric nano - sawteeth , the guidance direction has been observed to depend on the sawtooth height and length 11 , as well as on the cell type 12 . We next explore why different types of cells can be guided in different directions on the same sawtooth pattern . When inducing an initial polarization up the sawteeth , we observed three possible outcomes in our model : the cell moves up the sawteeth persis - tently ( Fig . 2a ) , the cell initially moves up the sawteeth and then turns around to move down the sawteeth ( Fig . 2b ) , or the cell stops . We induce the polarization up the sawteeth to counter the preferred spontaneous polarization down the sawteeth . Trajec - tories for these three representative behaviors are shown in Fig . 2c . To probe the selective guidance direction systematically , we created a phase diagram ( Fig . 2d ) in which we varied β and θ while keeping the sawtooth parameters the same . In all cases , the cell had an initial upward bias . At t = 250 , we measured the center - of - mass velocity . This velocity was used to determine the guidance direction shown in Fig . 2d . The data in this ﬁ gure indicates that as the actin - polymerization rate increases , the cell is able to overcome the nanotopography guidance direction and move down the sawteeth . We studied the transition in guidance direction by changing β at a ﬁ xed θ of 0 . 1 . Figure 2e shows that for a cell with an initial polarization , there is a sharp transition of guidance direction at β = 6 . 5 . Similar transitions occur at other values of θ . The phase transition is not signi ﬁ cantly altered if the phase - ﬁ eld simulation mesh size is doubled ( See Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . Below β = 6 . 5 , the cell always has the same ﬁ nal ( asymptotic ) velocity . This guidance velocity is determined by the sawtooth properties , rather than by the model parameters . Additionally , we observe hysteresis in the guidance direction . If the cell is not polarized initially , the cell can only be guided down the sawteeth . This observation indicates that the preferred guidance direction is down the sawteeth . Finally , a cell that reverses direction does not move solely parallel to the sawteeth . We ﬁ nd instead that a cell can turn to move at an oblique angle to the sawtooth orientation . The substrate parameters can be used to control the cell shape and the guidance direction independently . Our model exhibits a range of stable shape phenotypes that were studied in relation to the guidance direction . To control shape , we modi ﬁ ed the con - tractility of the cell , σ . Contractile forces control the shape of the cell 28 , and are linked closely to cell motility 29 . Here , we investi - gate the effect that contractility has on the direction of guidance . Figure 3a depicts a phase diagram of guidance direction as a function of σ and β ( θ = 0 . 1 ) .

By examining the dynamics at individual points in the phase diagram ( Fig . 3b ) , we can separate the velocity trajectories into two distinct regions : the ﬁ rst peak and dip in velocity due to the initial polarization and change in shape of the cell , and the ensuing long - term behavior . The initial peak and dip occur for all values of σ , followed by a positive rebound in velocity that occurs at t ≈ 150 . The major differences among the trajectories are in the long - time behavior . For σ = 1 there is a small negative acceleration , but the velocity up the sawteeth is persistent . The long - term velocity oscillations can be attributed to two factors : the cell slows down as it crawls up the sawteeth at its leading edge and small cell shape changes cause ﬂ uctuations in the center - of - mass velocity . The persistent velocity and the strong contractility of the cell result in elongation perpendicular to the direction of motion and lead to a persistent crescent shape ( Fig . 3c ) . For σ = 0 . 5 , the long - time positive velocity is not persistent . During the period of the simulation the cell moves up the sawteeth , but with a steadily decreasing velocity at long times . The contractility is high , so the cell is again elongated perpendicular to the direction of motion ( Fig . 3d ) . Finally , for σ = 0 . 1 , the long - time velocity is negative . A short period of positive acceleration at t ≈ 175 is observed but does not lead to a second change of direction . The cell in this case has an oval shape that is elongated parallel to the direction of motion ( Fig . 3e ) . Comparison to experimental cell shapes and motion . Next , we conduct a re - analysis of previous experimental data of D . dis - coideum migration on asymmetric sawteeth to capture additional details of cell motion . We ﬁ nd that the deterministic phase - ﬁ eld model can reproduce both the observed cell shapes and the preferred guidance direction . Figure 4a , b shows that D . dis - coideum can be elongated both parallel and perpendicular to the sawteeth , in analogy to the shape phenotypes seen in the model . As shown in Supplementary Movie 2 , D . discoideum cells moving along sawteeth tend to elongate in the direction of motion , in accordance with the less contractile cells shown in Fig . 3 . Addi - tionally , in a study of different cell lines migrating on sawteeth by Chen et al . 12 , it was observed that M4 cells , a cancerous mutant of MCF10A epithelial cells , exhibit elongation perpendicular to the direction of motion . This behavior agrees with the observation that cancerous cells are generally more contractile than their progenitor cells 29 . Although asymmetric sawteeth create a uni - directional bias of motion , D . discoideum is capable of moving down the sawteeth ( Fig . 4c ) , up the sawteeth ( Fig . 4d ) , as well as at arbitrary angles relative to the sawteeth . A variety of cell elongation angles with respect to the sawtooth orientation are observed experimentally , as seen in Figure 4e . The distribution of elongation angles has two local maxima at 0 ∘ ( parallel to sawteeth ) and 90 ∘ ( perpendicular to sawteeth ) . Fig . 4f shows a combined spider plot of cell trajectories on sawteeth of height 1 – 2 . 4 μ m . By changing the direction of initial cell polarization , a model trajectory can be produced that travels in any direction , and therefore the model can reproduce the arbitrary elongation angles ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) that are present experimentally . The simulated cell trajectories in the continuum model are deterministic , and so cannot reproduce the stochasticity of experimental trajectories .

To determine the effect of sawtooth dimensions on cell guidance direction we compared the model to experiments of cells on sawteeth of three different heights : 1 μ m , 1 . 8 μ m , and 2 . 4 μ m . The model predicts that cells with higher actin polymerization rates will move up the higher sawteeth ( Fig . 5a ) . Because cells with higher actin polymerization rate tend to have higher velocities 30 , 31 , one implication of our model is that faster - moving cells will move up sawteeth with smaller heights and down sawteeth with greater heights . Therefore , the model indirectly predicts that cells with higher velocity will move up the sawteeth for lower sawteeth heights and down the sawteeth for higher sawteeth heights . To determine the guidance direction of cells in experiments , we measured the average velocity of the D . discoideum cells as a function of direction relative to the sawteeth , with the angle 0 ∘ de ﬁ ned as moving up the sawteeth ( Fig . 5b – d ) . For the 1 μ m - high sawteeth , the average velocity peaks at 0 ∘ ( Fig . 5b ) . This observation is consistent with the phase diagram ( Fig . 5a ) , in which cells with a higher actin polymerization rate move up the sawteeth . For the 1 . 8 μ m - high and 2 . 4 μ m - high sawteeth the average velocity peaked at 180 ∘ . This result indicates that the D . discoideum cells do not reach the threshold velocity necessary to move up these sawteeth . Our observations suggest that asym - metric sawteeth can be used to guide cells with high velocities selectively , and that the velocity cutoff can be modi ﬁ ed by changing the sawtooth height . A toy model for cell migration on nanotopography . To strengthen the predictive power of the full phase - ﬁ eld simulations it is useful to capture the main observations in a toy model amenable to analytical extrapolation . The extrapolated positions can be validated in both the phase - ﬁ eld simulations and experi - mental observations . The toy model incorporates two key observations from the full phase - ﬁ eld model : the sub - critical onset of cell motion on ﬂ at surfaces and the unidirectional bias of motion by the sawtooth substrate . This toy model allows us to investigate stability of cell guidance . If there is no topography on the substrate , the equations of motion can be cast in the dimensionless form : ϵ ∂ t v ¼ v ð(cid:2) 1 þ β j v j 2 (cid:2) j v j 4 Þ ð 1 Þ Here ϵ ≪ 1 is the relaxation parameter , β is the driving parameter related to actin polymerization , and v is the center - of - mass velocity of the cell . For β > 2 , Eq . ( 1 ) possesses three stable ﬁ xed points : V 0 = 0 , and V 2 s ¼ β = 2 þ ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ β 2 = 4 (cid:2) 1 q . Correspondingly , there are two unstable ﬁ xed points V 2 u ¼ β = 2 (cid:2) ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ β 2 = 4 (cid:2) 1 q . In the presence of asymmetric nanotopography , the equation of motion assumes the form ϵ ∂ t v ¼ v ð(cid:2) 1 þ β j v j 2 (cid:2) j v j 4 Þ þ f ð x Þ x 0 ð 2 Þ Here x 0 is the unit vector in x - direction . In the case of asymmetric sawteeth , f ( x ) can be written in the form f ð x Þ ¼ c ð ax (cid:2) floor ð ax ÞÞ ð 3 Þ Here a is the spatial frequency ( spatial period L = 1 / a ) and c is the magnitude of the sawtooth modulation . Note that the sawteeth provide a positive bias , because 〈 f ( x ) 〉 > 0 . Despite their simplicity , Eqs . ( 2 , 3 ) capture many salient features exhibited by the fully 3D , continuum phase - ﬁ eld model as a function of the driving parameter β ( Fig . 6 ) . In particular , for pure one - dimensional motion ( i . e . , in the x - direction ) , for a large enough value of β the model exhibits two stable solutions , with motion up or down the sawteeth ( Fig . 6a ) . For smaller values of β , the model only shows spontaneous motion down the sawteeth . For even smaller values of β , no motion is possible , all in agreement with the phase - ﬁ eld model . The two - dimensional version of Eqs . ( 2 , 3 ) yields a surprising prediction that motion up sawteeth is always unstable ( Fig . 6b ) . An analytical stability analysis ( Supplementary Note 1 ) shows that a cell that is initially polarized in the direction up the sawteeth will , after some time , make a U - turn and begin to move down the sawteeth . However , as β increases the reversal time diverges ( Fig . 6c ) . Thus , the model indicates that the rich migration behavior observed both in the phase - ﬁ eld simulations and in the experiments is a synergistic effect of the sawtooth substrate and the cell ’ s intrinsic threshold for motion . By incorporating only three properties , the toy model leads to three nontrivial predictions : hysteresis between motion up and down the sawteeth , the existence of a critical sawtooth height above which motion up sawteeth is impossible , and the instability of motion up the sawteeth . These predictions indicate that the minimal model ingredients needed to capture velocity - based selective guidance are sub - critical onset of motion on ﬂ at substrates and unidirectional bias by the sawtooth substrate . Discussion We have demonstrated that a 3D phase - ﬁ eld model enables a rigorous investigation of cell motility on asymmetric nanotopo - graphy . Previous work has focused on cell - scale or system - scale gradients . Here we demonstrate that the model can also capture how cells integrate subcellular asymmetry into cell scale guidance . 1 1 . 4 1 . 8 2 . 2 2 . 6 5 . 5 6 6 . 5 7 Moves Down Sawteeth Moves Up Sawteeth a 8 6 4 2 0 v [ m / m i n ] 0 o 90 o 180 o 270 o b d c 8 6 4 2 0 v [ m / m i n ] 0 o 90 o 180 o 270 o 8 6 4 2 0 v [ m / m i n ] 0 o 90 o 180 o 270 o Sawtooth Height [ μm ] Fig . 5 Asymmetric sawteeth preferentially guide cells with high velocities . a A phase diagram demonstrating dependence of guidance direction on β and sawtooth height on a cell initially polarized up the sawteeth in the phase - ﬁ eld simulations .

Cell - migration experiments on asymmetric sawteeth have demonstrated that the guidance direction is affected by the sawtooth dimensions 11 and the speci ﬁ c cell line used 12 . The phase - ﬁ eld model reproduces the key phenomena observed in these experiments , including spontaneous polarization , uni - directional guidance , and elongation phenotypes . By tuning model parameters , we can change the guidance direction and cell shape in accordance with the behavior observed for different cell lines . The correspondence between the model and experiments yields insights into the relative importance of actin polymeriza - tion , contractility , or other cell properties in promoting cell - type - dependent guidance behavior . On ﬂ at surfaces , the phase - ﬁ eld models require an initial polarization 13 , 25 or a strongly randomized internal actin density 32 to observe directed cell motion . In contrast , asymmetric sawteeth provide guidance cues that cause the cell to move spontaneously . Consequently , surface asymmetries may be one factor that initi - ates directional migration in vivo and in natural environments . Our model shows that the actin polymerization rate is a pri - mary driver of the cell guidance direction on asymmetric saw - teeth . There is a transition in guidance direction from down the sawteeth to up the sawteeth at a critical value of the actin poly - merization rate . This critical value is dependent on other model parameters as well , such as the sawtooth height . A toy model based on ﬁ ndings from phase - ﬁ eld simulations veri ﬁ es this rela - tionship and gives analytical evidence that motion up - sawtooth is unstable . The actin polymerization rate is directly related to the cell velocity , so faster cells should tend to move up the sawteeth . In agreement with the predictions of our model , experimental data for cell guidance on asymmetric sawteeth show velocity - dependent selective guidance . Additionally , the model predicts that increasing the sawtooth height should increase the velocity threshold for cells to move up the sawteeth . We veri ﬁ ed this prediction by showing that faster D . discoideum cells are pre - ferentially guided up asymmetric sawteeth that are 1 μ m high . However , on asymmetric sawteeth with heights of 1 . 8 μ m and 2 . 4 μ m , faster cells are still guided down the sawteeth . In our model , contractility affects both the shape and the guidance direction of a cell . Larger values of contractility are associated with the cell moving up the sawteeth . Thus , more contractile cells are not guided in the more typical direction on asymmetric sawteeth . Studies have linked higher contractility to invasiveness in cancer cells 29 , and this connection may be related to the change in guidance direction that we observe . The simple physical model presented here can explain many features of cell motility on asymmetric nanotopography . Because the phase - ﬁ eld model is highly modular , it can be extended fur - ther to obtain a fuller picture of cellular dynamics on asymmetric nanotopography . An even more realistic model could include the modulation of speci ﬁ c or non - speci ﬁ c adhesive effects ( e . g . , focal adhesions ) . Additionally , the actin dynamics can be modi ﬁ ed to include the effect of regulatory proteins via an excitable network model such as local excitation global inhibition biased excitable network 33 or linked excitable networks 34 . Although our approach captures many important aspects of subcellular environmental asymmetries on cell migration , in vivo the dynamics can be affected by many other factors . It is known that the cells can remodel , and even degrade , the local topo - graphy , especially in the context of some invasive cancers 35 , 36 . Many cancer cells form invadopodia , i . e . , actin - rich protrusions of the plasma membrane that are associated with degradation of the extracellular matrix . Incorporation of such phenomena into a phase - ﬁ eld model can shed light on cancer invasiveness and metastasis and is highly desirable . However , a 3D phase - ﬁ eld model on deformable and degradable substrates is a formidable computational task that we leave to future study . Methods Phase - ﬁ eld equations . The following model was used to describe the cell migration in 3D : ∂ t ρ ¼ D ρ Δ ρ (cid:2) ρ ð 1 (cid:2) ρ Þð δ ½ ρ (cid:3) (cid:2) σ j p j 2 (cid:2) ρ Þ (cid:2) α p (cid:4) ∇ ρ (cid:2) κ ∇ Φ (cid:4) ∇ ρ (cid:2) λρ Φ 2 ; ð 4 Þ ∂ t p ¼ D p Δ p (cid:2) β e (cid:2) Tc Δ S ½ð 1 (cid:2) θ Þ ^ P ð ∇ ρ Þ þ θ ∇ ρ (cid:3) Ψ (cid:2) τ (cid:2) 1 p (cid:2) γ ∇ ρ (cid:4) p (cid:3) (cid:4) p (cid:2) Φ 2 p : ð 5 Þ Here , the phase - ﬁ eld ρ describes the cell shape , p characterizes the actin orienta - tion , Φ ( r ) models a steric ﬁ eld moderating the cell ’ s interaction with the surface , and Ψ ( r ) restricts actin generation close to the surface . The entire motility mechanism is captured by Eqs . ( 4 , 5 ) . Actin polymerizes near the cell boundary and produces a protrusion force via the polymerization ratchet mechanism 37 . As the cell moves forward , the actin polarization at the back of the cell degrades based on a model of acto - myosin contraction 13 . The cell volume is conserved as a ﬁ xed point through the term δ [ ρ ] . This model of cell motility has been shown to reproduce the lamellipodium - based motion of keratocytes on ﬂ at surfaces 13 . We use a modi ﬁ ed version of the model that accounts for cell surface tension 38 . Surface tension is introduced using the exponential term e − Tc Δ S , where T is the surface tension strength , c is the curvature , and Δ S is the difference between surface area at a given time step and a reference surface area . This term makes the actin polymerization rate lower at points of high curvature , thereby preventing the cell from tearing apart . We introduced this term by necessity based on the high curvature of the nanotopography studied here . Numerical method . The model used here is an extension of a previously published method 25 . Equations ( 4 , 5 ) were solved on a 100 μ m× 100 μ m×25 μ m rectangular grid ( corresponding to 576 × 576 ×128 mesh points ) in the domain using a split operator method on a periodic domain . The algorithm was implemented on gra - phical processing units using the NVIDIA CUDA programming language . The diffusion terms were calculated in Fourier space , and other operators were calcu - lated using ﬁ nite - difference methods . The curvature c in Eq . ( 4 ) was calculated 0 5 10 15 20 25 t - 2 - 1 0 1 2 v x v x ( 0 ) = - 1 v x ( 0 ) = 1 0 5 10 15 20 25 t - 2 - 1 0 1 2 v a b c 1 1 . 5 2 2 . 5 3 3 . 5 4 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 0 D i r e c t i on C hange T i m e Sawtooth Height v x v y Fig . 6 Toy model capturing the main features of the full 3D phase - ﬁ eld model . a Trajectories up and down the sawteeth in the simpli ﬁ ed model , Eq .

Unless otherwise mentioned , the model parameters used were those given in Table 1 . The substrate with asymmetric sawteeth was implemented via prescribing the static ﬁ elds Φ and Ψ . The substrate studied for this paper was a sawtooth of length 4 . 2 μ m and a default height 1 . 4 μ m ; other heights were used as discussed above . Cell tracking . Cell tracking was performed on bright - ﬁ eld movies of D . discoideum moving on asymmetric sawteeth reported in a previous paper 11 . First , the threshold of the fast Fourier transform ( FFT ) of the images was used to remove the bright spikes associated with the periodic sawteeth . A low - pass Hamming ﬁ lter was applied to the FFT . An inverse FFT was then applied to recover an image with sawteeth removed . Next , the image contrast was changed so that 1 % of the brightest and darkest parts of the image were saturated . A morphological top - hat ﬁ lter was applied to remove high - frequency noise . Finally , the image was binarized using the Otsu thresholding method 39 . The cells were tracked using the MATLAB regionprops function to ﬁ nd elongation and centroid location . The cell trajectories were found using a particle tracking algorithm fed the centroids of the cell locations . Reporting summary .
