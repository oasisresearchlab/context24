INTRODUCTION Inositol 5 ¢ - phosphatases represent a family of proteins which cleave the phosphate on the 5 ¢ position of the inositol ring of inositol polyphosphates and / or phosphoinositides ( Jefferson et al . , 1997 ; Woscholski and Parker , 1997 ; Mitchell et al . , 1996 ) . In agreement with the multiple functions of inositol metabolites in cell physiology ( De Camilli et al . , 1996 ; Toker and Cantley , 1997 ; Berridge , 1997 ) , members of this protein family have been implicated in a variety of cellular processes ranging from intracellular signaling , cytoskeletal function and membrane dynamics including vesicular traffic ( reviewed by Woscholski and Parker , 1997 ; Mitchell et al . , 1996 ) . A subset of inositol 5 ¢ - phosphatases , referred to as synaptojanins ( McPherson et al . , 1994b ; McPherson et al . , 1996 ; Nemoto et al . , 1997 ; Srinivasan et al . , 1997 ) , are characterized by a three - domain structure . In these enzymes the central catalytic domain is ﬂanked by a variable COOH - terminal region that is rich in prolines and an NH 2 - terminal domain with homology to the cytoplasmic domain of the yeast protein Sac1p . This protein is implicated in the control of phosphatidylinositol ( PtdIns ) metabolism ( Kearns et al . , 1997 ) , and sac1 mutant alleles were independently identiﬁed as suppressors of mutations in the actin gene ( sac = suppressor of actin ) and in the gene encoding the yeast phosphatidylinositol transfer protein Sec14p ( Novick et al . , 1989 ; Cleves et al . , 1989 ; Whitters et al . , 1993 ) . The variable COOH - terminal domains of the synaptojanins contain multiple protein - protein interaction modules . One of their putative functions is to target speciﬁc synaptojanin family members to distinct subcellular sites ( McPherson et al . , 1996 ; Nemoto et al . , 1997 ; Haffner et al . , 1997 ; Cremona and De Camilli , 1997 ) . Synaptojanin 1 , which is highly enriched in nerve terminals ( McPherson et al . , 1996 ) , was proposed to play a key role in the clathrin - dependent endocytosis of synaptic vesicles ( McPherson et al . , 1994a , b ; Haffner et al . , 1997 ) . In addition , it has been implicated in the function of the actin cytoskeleton and in intracellular signaling ( Mitchell et al . , 1996 ; Sakisaka et al . , 1997 ) . Interacting partners for its alternatively spliced COOH - terminal region include proteins with a role in endocytosis and / or signaling such as amphiphysin ( David et al . , 1996 ; McPherson et al . , 1996 ; Bauerfeind et al . , 1997 ; Wigge et al . , 1997 ; de Heuvel et al . , 1997 ; Micheva et al . , 1997 ) , Eps15 ( Haffner et al . , 1997 ) , the adaptor protein Grb2 ( McPherson et al . , 1994b ; Sakisaka et al . , 1997 ) and the SH3p4 / SH3p8 / SH3p13 protein family ( endophilin family ) ( Ringstad et al . , 1997 ; de Heuvel et al . , 1997 ) . Synaptojanin 2 is very similar to synaptojanin 1 in the Sac1p and catalytic domains , but differs in the COOH - terminal domain ( Nemoto et al . , 1997 ; Khvotchev and Südhof , 1998 ) . Sequencing of the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae has demonstrated the existence of four proteins with the signature motif of inositol 5 ¢ - phosphatases ( Goffeau et al . , 1997 ) . Three 3347 Journal of Cell Science 111 , 3347 - 3356 ( 1998 ) Printed in Great Britain © The Company of Biologists Limited 1998 JCS9825 The synaptojanins represent a subfamily of inositol 5 ¢ - phosphatases that contain an NH 2 - terminal Sac1p homology domain . A nerve terminal - enriched synaptojanin , synaptojanin 1 , was previously proposed to participate in the endocytosis of synaptic vesicles and actin function . The genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains three synaptojanin - like genes ( SJL1 , SJL2 and SJL3 ) , none of which is essential for growth . We report here that a yeast mutant lacking SJL1 and SJL2 ( ∆ sjl1 ∆ sjl2 ) exhibits a severe defect in receptor - mediated and ﬂuid - phase endocytosis . A less severe endocytic defect is present in a ∆ sjl2 ∆ sjl3 mutant , while endocytosis is normal in a ∆ sjl1 ∆ sjl3 mutant . None of the mutants are impaired in invertase secretion . The severity of the endocytic impairment of the sjl double mutants correlates with the severity of actin and polarity defects . Furthermore , the deletion of SJL1 suppresses the temperature - sensitive growth defect of sac6 , a mutant in yeast ﬁmbrin , supporting a role for synaptojanin family members in actin function . These ﬁndings provide a ﬁrst direct evidence for a role of synaptojanin family members in endocytosis and provide further evidence for a close link between endocytosis and actin function .

A ﬁrst characterization of strains harboring mutations in these genes demonstrated that single mutants display only minor defects , suggesting that each SJL gene has a redundant function . However , a variety of phenotypes including abnormal sensitivity to high osmolarity , changes in cell morphology , actin organization and vacuolar morphology were found in some of the double mutants ( Srinivasan et al . , 1997 ) . Luo and Chang ( 1997 ) have also reported that mutations in SJL3 ( referred to as SOP2 ) can suppress the temperature - sensitive growth of a mutant in the plasmalemma ATPase encoded by PMA1 . In this mutant , pma1 ts , Pma1p is mislocalized to the vacuole ( Chang and Fink , 1995 ) . The goal of this study was to provide functional evidence for the putative role of synaptojanin family members in endocytosis by analyzing yeast strains lacking SJL genes for endocytic defects . We report the occurrence of a major endocytic internalization defect in a ∆ sjl1 ∆ sjl2 mutant and a milder defect in a ∆ sjl2 ∆ sjl3 mutant . The endocytic defects in these mutant strains correlated with defects in actin organization and cell polarity as typically seen in mutants defective in the early stages of endocytosis . * MATERIALS AND METHODS Strains and growth conditions The S . cerevisiae strains used are listed in Table 1 . Unless otherwise indicated , yeast strains were grown in complete medium ( 1 % yeast extract , 2 % peptone and 2 % dextrose ) ( YPD ) to early logarithmic phase ( 0 . 5 - 2 · 10 7 cells / ml ) at 30°C in a rotary shaker . YPD containing 1 M NaCl ( hsYPD ) , as well as medium containing 3 % glycerol as a carbon source ( YPG ) , was used to reveal growth defects of the ∆ sjl1 ∆ sjl2 and ∆ sjl2 ∆ sjl3 mutants . Genetic manipulations Large internal portions of the genes SJL1 , SJL2 and SJL3 were deleted from the genome and replaced with the URA3 , LEU2 and HIS3 genes , respectively . sjl1 : : URA3 , which replaced the complete ORF of SJL1 with the yeast URA3 gene , was constructed as follows . The 0 . 2 - kb fragments immediately adjacent to the SJL1 coding region were ampliﬁed by PCR ( polymerase chain reaction ) and subcloned into the yeast integration plasmid pRS306 ( Sikorski and Hieter , 1989 ) . The resulting plasmid was digested with Hin dIII and the linearized disruption cassette , consisting of the URA3 gene ﬂanked by the 5 ¢ - upstream and 3 ¢ - downstream regions of the SJL1 gene , was transformed into the haploid strain NY1210 or NY1211 by the lithium acetate method ( Ito et al . , 1983 ) . Stable Ura + transformants were isolated , and the proper gene replacement was conﬁrmed by PCR analysis ( data not shown ) . The sjl2 : : LEU2 and sjl3 : : HIS3 disruptions that replaced the complete SJL2 and SJL3 ORFs with the yeast LEU2 and HIS3 genes were constructed in essentially the same way by using pRS305 and pRS303 , respectively ( Sikorski and Hieter , 1989 ) . To obtain ∆ sjl mutants in a bar1 - 1 strain background each of the original sjl deletion strains was crossed at least three times to either BS64 , BS188 , or RH2878 , which are all isogenic . To generate the sjl double mutants , each of the single mutants was mated overnight on YPD plates . The diploids were puriﬁed , sporulated and tetrad analysis was performed . The double mutants were identiﬁed by the auxotrophic markers ( URA3 , LEU2 and HIS3 ) . A characterization of the growth properties of these mutants conﬁrmed and extended previous observations made with a different set of mutants ( Srinivasan et al . , 1997 ) . More speciﬁcally , no growth defects were observed in single mutants , as previously reported ( Srinivasan et al . , 1997 ) . The ∆ sjl1 ∆ sjl2 strain was cold - sensitive ( cs ) and temperature - sensitive ( ts ) for growth on rich medium ( YPD ) at 15°C and 37°C , respectively . In addition , it grew considerably slower than wild type even at the most permissive temperature of 30°C . The ∆ sjl2 ∆ sjl3 double mutant only revealed signiﬁcant growth deﬁciencies at 37°C when grown on rich medium containing 1 M NaCl ( hsYPD ) , or on rich medium containing the non - fermentable carbon source glycerol ( YPG ) . The ∆ sjl1 ∆ sjl3 double mutant grew as well as the wild - type strain under the conditions tested . A diploid strain heterozygous for the three deletions was obtained by crossing a ∆ sjl2 ∆ sjl3 double mutant to a ∆ sjl1 single mutant . After sporulation and tetrad dissection , no Ura + / Leu + / His + colonies were recovered , while double sjl deletions were recovered with the expected frequency . This ﬁnding conﬁrms that the simultaneous B . Singer - Krüger and others * During the revision of this manuscript Stolz et al .

Genetic interactions between the ∆ sjl mutants ( BS627 , BS628 , BS631 ) and mutants in rvs167 and sac6 ( BS323 , and BS325 , respectively ; Singer - Krüger and Ferro - Novick , 1997 ) were tested after sporulation and tetrad analysis . Spores were grown at 25°C and the growth of the progeny was analyzed at various temperatures . Lucifer Yellow CH uptake and FM4 - 64 labeling Lucifer Yellow CH ( LY ) uptake was carried out as described by Singer - Krüger et al . ( 1995 ) , except that more exhaustive washes were performed to conﬁrm that the labeling at the cell periphery observed in the ∆ sjl1 ∆ sjl2 double mutant was represented by dye trapped in plasma membrane invaginations . FM4 - 64 labeling was performed as described ( Vida and Emr , 1995 ; Wendland et al . , 1996 ) at either 30°C or 0°C . At the end of the incubations cells were mounted on coverslips coated with concanavalin A to promote adhesion to the glass and examined in a Zeiss axiophot ﬂuorescent microscope . Internalization and degradation of a - factor These assays were performed as previously described ( Dulic et al . , 1991 ; Singer - Krüger and Ferro - Novick , 1997 ) using 35 S - labeled a - factor , which was prepared from biosynthetically labeled yeast cells that overproduce the pheromone ( Singer - Krüger and Ferro - Novick , 1997 ) . Internalization studies were performed by two protocols using strains RH2878 , BS582 , BS621 , BS622 , BS623 and BS624 . In one protocol , a - factor was added to cells preincubated at 30°C and cell samples were then removed after 1 , 5 , 10 , 15 , 30 and 60 minutes at the same temperature . The values in Fig . 2a represent the mean of at least three independent experiments . In the second protocol ( ‘pulse - chase’ ) , a - factor was prebound to cells at 0°C for 1 hour . Cells were then harvested , resuspended in prewarmed ( 30°C ) YPD medium and samples were withdrawn and analyzed as described above . The ﬁrst protocol , which avoids a 0°C preincubation , was used for a systematic analysis of all mutants due to the cold sensitivity of the ∆ sjl1 ∆ sjl2 mutant . The a - factor degradation assay in the wild type and ∆ sjl2 ∆ sjl3 mutant was performed using the ‘pulse - chase’ protocol ( Dulic et al . , 1991 ) . The cell - associated ( pH 6 . 0 sample ) and internalized ( pH 1 . 2 sample ) pheromone was analyzed following a 1 , 7 . 5 , 15 , 30 , 60 and 90 minute incubation at 30°C . Invertase secretion Cells were grown in YPD ( 5 % glucose ) overnight to early logarithmic phase at 30°C , washed in YPD ( 0 . 1 % glucose ) and resuspended in YPD ( 0 . 1 % glucose ) at 0 . 5 OD units / ml to allow for the derepression of invertase . After 1 , 40 and 60 minutes of incubation at 30°C , 1 ml samples of the culture were removed , supplemented with NaN 3 ( 10 mM ﬁnal concentration ) , shifted to 0°C , washed with ice - cold 10 mM NaN 3 , and processed for the analysis of total and external invertase activity by the method of Goldstein and Lampen ( 1975 ) . Visualization of the actin cytoskeleton , bud scars and mitochondria Approximately 20 - 50 ml of each cell culture were ﬁxed during a 15 minute incubation in 4 % formaldehyde . The cells were harvested , incubated further in buffered 4 % formaldehyde for 1 hour and resuspended ( 1 - 2 · 10 7 cells / ml ) in PBS . 40 m l of the cell suspension was stained by the addition of 5 m l of rhodamine - phalloidin ( Molecular Probes , Eugene , OR ) ( 6 . 6 m M stock in methanol ) and 5 m l of calcoﬂuor ( 1 mg / ml stock in H 2 O ) ( 1 hour at room temperature ) followed by several washes in PBS . Cells were immediately viewed on concanavalin A - coated coverslips . To visualize nuclei , ﬁxed cells were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature in 10 mg / ml DAPI . Mitochondria were visualized in living cells . Approximately 0 . 2 OD 600 units of an early logarithmic culture were stained with DiOC 6 ( 250 ng / ml ) and Mitotracker Red ( 0 . 2 m M ) ( Molecular Probes , Eugene , OR ) in YPD under conditions that preferentially label yeast mitochondria ( Pringle et al . , 1989 ) and , after embedding in low - melting agarose , viewed by ﬂuorescence microscopy using a Zeiss axiophot microscope . Electron microscopy Conventional electron microscopy ( EM ) was performed as described ( Rieder et al . , 1996 ) on cells grown at 30°C to early logarithmic phase . RESULTS Fluid - phase endocytosis is defective in the ∆ sjl1 ∆ sjl2and ∆ sjl2 ∆ sjl3double mutants Fluid phase endocytosis was monitored with the ﬂuorescent marker Lucifer Yellow CH ( LY ) . As previously reported ( Riezman , 1985 ) , incubation of wild - type yeast cells with LY for 1 hour at 30°C resulted in its accumulation in the vacuole and in a bright selective labeling of this organelle ( Fig . 1a , a ¢ ) . Similar results were obtained with the single mutants and with the ∆ sjl1 ∆ sjl3 double mutant ( Fig . 1c , c ¢ ) . In ∆ sjl1 ∆ sjl2 , no vacuolar accumulation of LY was observed and LY labeling was conﬁned to peripheral punctate - like structures which dimmed after extensive washings at 0°C ( Fig . 1b , b ¢ ) , and thus probably reﬂected dye trapped in invaginations of the plasma membrane ( see below ) . In the ∆ sjl2 ∆ sjl3 double mutant ( Fig . 1d , d ¢ ) , only a very weak LY labeling of the vacuoles was observed . The results are consistent with the occurrence of an endocytic defect in the ∆ sjl1 ∆ sjl2 and the ∆ sjl2 ∆ sjl3 double mutants , although the nature of the defect appears to differ in the two strains . Receptor - mediated endocytosis is abnormal in the ∆ sjl1 ∆ sjl2and ∆ sjl2 ∆ sjl3double mutants Receptor - mediated endocytosis was analyzed by measuring the internalization of the mating pheromone a - factor ( Fig . 2a ) ( Dulic et al . , 1991 ) . After a short preincubation at 30°C , cells were exposed to 35 S - a - factor at the same temperature and the percentage of 35 S - labeled pheromone which had become inaccessible to an acid wash after various times was determined . As shown in Fig . 2a , uptake of 35 S - a - factor by the ∆ sjl1 ∆ sjl3 mutant as well as the ∆ sjl2 mutant was comparable to wild type and approached approximally 100 % after 30 minutes of internalization . In the ∆ sjl2 ∆ sjl3 mutant , the initial rate of 35 S - a - factor internalization was lower when compared to wild type ( t 1 / 2 = 7 . 5 minutes as compared to 5 minutes ) , and after 60 minutes of incubation only approximately 70 % of the mating pheromone had been internalized . In the ∆ sjl1 ∆ sjl2 mutant the overall rate of internalization was even more severely impaired ( t 1 / 2 = 18 . 5 minutes ) . Although the proportion of acid - resistant 35 S - a - factor at the earliest time point ( 1 minute ) was relatively high ( see below for discussion ) , little further increase in apparent 35 S - a - factor internalization was observed at the 60 minutes time point . The temperature at which these defects were observed ( 30°C ) was permissive for the growth of both mutants . When a - factor internalization was performed at 37°C , the endocytosis defect in the ∆ sjl2 ∆ sjl3 mutant was only slightly aggravated ( data not shown ) . The same experiment could not be performed for the ∆ sjl1 ∆ sjl2 strain , due to the poor growth of this strain at 37°C . A comparable inhibition of a - factor internalizaton in the ∆ sjl2 ∆ sjl3 and the ∆ sjl1 ∆ sjl2 mutants was observed when the uptake assay was performed using a ‘pulse - chase’ protocol , 3350 B .

( a ) Cells of the a mating type were preincubated in YPD medium for 15 minutes at 30°C before 35 S - a - factor was added and the incubation continued at 30°C . At the indicated times , samples were withdrawn and processed as described in the Materials and Methods . ( b ) Wild - type and ∆ sjl2 ∆ sjl3 cells were incubated with 35 S - a - factor for 1 hour on ice . Subsequently , cells were collected , resuspended in prewarmed YPD medium ( 30°C ) and transferred to a 30°C waterbath . At the indicated times , samples were withdrawn and processed as described in Materials and methods . Total cell - associated ( pH 6 . 0 washed cells ) ( 6 ) and internalized a - factor ( pH 1 . 2 washed cells ) ( 1 ) were extracted at the indicated times and resolved by thin - layer chromatography . The positions of intact ( i ) and degraded ( d ) pheromone are indicated . The ﬂuorograms were exposed for 10 days at - 70°C . ( a ) wild type ; ( b ) ∆ sjl2 ∆ sjl3 . 3351 Synaptojanins in yeast endocytosis which involves preincubation of the cells with the pheromone at 0°C followed by a shift to 30°C . In wild - type cells , internalized a - factor is transported via two distinct endosomal intermediates to the vacuole , where it is ﬁnally degraded ( Singer and Riezman , 1990 ; Singer - Krüger et al . , 1993 ) . Since the ∆ sjl2 ∆ sjl3 double mutant internalized pheromone after 60 minutes of incubation , we determined whether internalized 35 S - a - factor underwent normal degradation , i . e . was transported to the vacuole . The degradation of a - factor at different time points of internalization was assessed by separating intact and degraded forms by thin - layer chromatography . In wild - type cells the majority of pheromone was degraded approximately 30 minutes after internalization , as revealed by the disappearance of intact a - factor and by the concomitant appearance of degradation products ( Fig . 2b ) . This process was only slightly delayed in the ∆ sjl2 ∆ sjl3 mutant . Such a delay , however , could be an indirect consequence of the slower rate of pheromone internalization and may not represent a disruption of the endocytic pathway from the cell surface to the vacuole . Abnormal labeling with FM4 - 64 in the ∆ sjl1 ∆ sjl2 mutant Another method that has been used to monitor endocytosis in yeast is uptake of the ﬂuorescent , amphipathic dye FM4 - 64 ( Vida and Emr , 1995 ) . FM4 - 64 is soluble in water , accumulates very efficiently into membranes , but does not cross the bilayer . When added to wild - type cells at 0°C , it selectively labels the cell surface and the surface - bound dye can be rapidly removed by washing . At physiological temperatures it is rapidly internalized and transported to the vacuole . Previously , it was reported that at 30°C the uptake of FM4 - 64 by ∆ sjl single mutants and ∆ sjl1 ∆ sjl3 and ∆ sjl2 ∆ sjl3 double mutants was qualitatively similar to wild - type ( Srinivasan et al . , 1997 ) . Surprisingly , a very high level of FM4 - 64 labeling on vacuolar - like structures was also observed in the ∆ sjl1 ∆ sjl2 mutant at this temperature ( Srinivasan et al . , 1997 ) . This result appears to contradict the endocytosis internalization defect of this strain reported in Figs 1 and 2a . Incubations at 0°C were therefore performed to determine whether the structures labeled by FM4 - 64 in the ∆ sjl1 ∆ sjl2 Fig . 3 . Presence of vacuolar - like invagination exposed to the extracellular space in the D sjl1 D sjl2 strain . ( a - d ) Wild - type ( a , c ) and D sjl1 D sjl2 ( b , d ) cells were labeled with FM4 - 64 at 0°C for 30 minutes and photographed either immediately ( a , b ) or after a 60 minute wash at the same temperature ( c , d ) . Prior to washing ( a , b ) only the outer cell proﬁle is labeled in wild - type cells , while intense labeling of apparently intracellular ring - like structures is visible in the D sjl1 D sjl2 double mutants . The outer cell proﬁle is hardly visible in ﬁeld b due to a shorter photographic exposure than for wild - type cells . Both the label of wild - type cells and most of the label of the D sjl1 D sjl2 strain disappears after washing , suggesting that the vacuolar - like labeling of this strain represents invaginations of the cell surface .

Bars , 5 m m ( a - d ) ; 200 nm ( e , f , g ) . 3352 strain represent bona ﬁde endocytic vesicles or invaginations of the cell surface . Addition of FM4 - 64 at 0°C resulted in the labeling of the typical yeast surface proﬁle in wild - type cells ( Fig . 3a ) . A similar staining was also observed in ∆ sjl2 ∆ sjl3 and ∆ sjl1 ∆ sjl3 cells ( data not shown ) . In contrast , a massive vacuole - like labeling , in addition to labeling of the outer cell proﬁle , was observed within seconds after addition of the dye in the ∆ sjl1 ∆ sjl2 strain ( Fig . 3b ) . However , not only the labeling of the outer cell proﬁle , but also most of the internal - like labeling of ∆ sjl1 ∆ sjl 2 cells could be removed by extensive washings at 0°C ( Fig . 3d ) . Thus , the seemingly ‘internal’ labeling does not reﬂect segregation of the dye into bona ﬁde intracellular vesicles . The structures labeled by FM4 - 64 at 0°C in the ∆ sjl1 ∆ sjl2 double mutant are likely to represent the vacuolar - like proﬁles previously described by electron microscopy in this mutant . The plasmalemma of this strain forms deep invaginations , which often fold onto themselves to almost completely enwrap portions of the cytoplasm . As a consequence , structures are generated that in many planes of sections appear as islands of cytoplasm surrounded by two membranes ( Srinivasan et al . , 1997 ; Fig . 3e - g ) . However , as demonstrated by in vivo labeling of spheroplasts with cationized ferritin ( a membrane - impermeant electron microscopy marker for endocytosis ; Herzog and Farquhar , 1983 ; Wendland et al . , 1996 ) , the space between these membranes was clearly continuous with the cell surface , even when the continuity was not visible in the plane of section ( not shown ) . For comparison , we also examined the ultrastructural morphology of a well - established yeast endocytic internalization mutant , rvs167 ( Munn et al . , 1995 ; Singer - Krüger and Ferro - Novick , 1997 ) . Although the ∆ sjl1 ∆ sjl2 and the rvs167 mutants are similarly impaired in the internalization of a - factor , the rvs167 mutant did not reveal the deep invaginations of the plasma membrane that are present in the ∆ sjl1 ∆ sjl2 mutant ( data not shown ) . Invertase secretion is not affected in ∆ sjlmutants To determine whether the endocytic defect of the ∆ sjl1 ∆ sjl2 and ∆ sjl2 ∆ sjl3 strains reﬂects a general inhibition of membrane traffic at the cell surface , we assayed the secretion of invertase . Cells were grown in high glucose medium to repress the SUC2 gene encoding invertase , and then SUC2 was derepressed by shifting to low glucose medium . 40 and 60 minutes after the shift , total and external invertase activities were determined . In the ∆ sjl1 ∆ sjl3 mutant , the level of invertase induction was comparable to wild - type cells , while it was somewhat reduced in the ∆ sjl2 ∆ sjl3 and ∆ sjl1 ∆ sjl2 strains ( data not shown ) . All mutant strains , however , retained the ability to secrete invertase into the periplasmic space , since the ratios of external invertase activity to total invertase activity were in a similar range ( 0 . 83 in wild type , 0 . 87 in ∆ sjl1 ∆ sjl2 , 0 . 82 in ∆ sjl2 ∆ sjl3 and 0 . 79 in ∆ sjl1 ∆ sjl3 ) . This ﬁnding argues against an essential direct role of Sjl1p , Sjl2p and Sjl3p in the secretory pathway , including exocytosis . Budding polarity defects in ∆ sjl1 ∆ sjl2and ∆ sjl2 ∆ sjl3mutants A correlation has been observed in a variety of yeast mutant strains between endocytic internalization defects , defects in actin organization and abnormal cell polarity . In view of the endocytic ( see above ) and actin organization ( Srinivasan et al . , 1997 ) defects of the ∆ sjl1 ∆ sjl2 and ∆ sjl2 ∆ sjl3 double mutants , we examined the polarity of budding in these mutants . S . cerevisiae exhibits stereotypic patterns of bud site selection . Haploid cells display an axial budding pattern in which the new bud is adjacent to the previous one , while diploids bud in a bipolar pattern from either pole ( Chant and Pringle , 1995 ) . This process can be monitored by staining chitin with the ﬂuorescent dye calcoﬂuor . The budding pattern was clearly axial in wild - type ( Fig . 4a ) and ∆ sjl1 ∆ sjl3 haploid B . Singer - Krüger and others Fig . 4 . The ∆ sjl1 ∆ sj2 and ∆ sjl2 ∆ sjl3 mutants reveal an altered budding pattern in haploid cells which correlates with abnormal actin organization . Wild - type and ∆ sjl double mutants were ﬁxed with formaldehyde and stained either with the ﬂuorescent dye calcoﬂuor ( a - d ) or rhodamine - phalloidin ( a ¢ - d ¢ ) . ( a ) Wild - type ; ( b ) ∆ sjl1 ∆ sjl2 ; ( c ) ∆ sjl1 ∆ sjl3 ; ( d ) ∆ sjl2 ∆ sjl3 . Bar , 4 . 5 m m ( a - d ) and 5 m m ( a ¢ - d ¢ ) . 3353 Synaptojanins in yeast endocytosis cells ( Fig . 4c ) , in agreement with a normal organization of the actin cytoskeleton in these strains ( actin patches concentrated in the bud or daughter cells and actin cables aligned along the mother - daughter cell axis ) ( Fig . 4a ¢ , c ¢ ) . In contrast , budding polarity was completely lost in the ∆ sjl1 ∆ sjl2 strain ( Fig . 4b ) , in which actin patches were randomly distributed throughout the mother - daughter cell ( Fig . 4b ¢ ) . Chitin rings appeared smaller than normal and the diffuse cell surface labeling for chitin was brighter than in wild - type cells ( Fig . 4b ) . In the ∆ sjl2 ∆ sjl3 mutant , a less severe disruption of budding polarity was observed together with some enhanced diffuse chitin labeling . In this mutant , most , but not all , chitin rings were adjacent to each other ( Fig . 4d ) . Although the ∆ sjl2 ∆ sjl3 mutant displayed an unpolarized distribution of actin cortical patches similar to the ∆ sjl1 ∆ sjl2 strain , the aberrant actin patches in the former strain were clearly larger and less numerous ( compare Fig . 4d ¢ with Fig . 4b ¢ ) . In summary , ∆ sjl1 ∆ sjl2 and ∆ sjl2 ∆ sjl3 mutants display defects in bud site selection during polarized cell growth consistent with defects in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton . The phenotypically distinct defects in polarity and actin organization revealed between the ∆ sjl1 ∆ sjl2 and ∆ sjl2 ∆ sjl3 mutants suggest distinct roles of synaptojanin family members in actin function ( see also below ) . SJL1genetically interacts with SAC6 In view of the effect of SJL mutations on actin organization and on the internalization step of endocytosis , we searched for an interaction between the SJL genes and two other genes implicated in actin function and endocytosis : SAC6 ( Kübler and Riezman , 1993 ) and RVS167 ( Munn et al . , 1995 ) . These two genes encode the yeast homologs of ﬁmbrin ( an actin bundling protein ) ( Adams and Botstein , 1989 ) and amphiphysin ( David et al . , 1994 ) , respectively . Each ∆ sjl single mutant was crossed to sac6 and rvs167 mutants , respectively . After sporulation and dissection of the heterozygous diploids , the colonies that were derived from each of the four spores were grown up at 25°C . Subsequently , growth was analyzed at various temperatures ( 30°C , 35°C and 37°C ) . Strikingly , at 37°C , the restrictive temperature for the sac6 mutant , the growth defect was partially suppressed by the deletion of SJL1 , but not by the deletion of SJL2 nor SJL3 ( Fig . 5 ) . Strains carrying a mutation in RVS167 in combination with the deletion of each of the SJL1 , SJL2 and SJL3 genes , respectively , did not exhibit a growth phenotype that was markedly different from that displayed by each of the single mutants . Finally , overexpression of SAC6 , ACT1 ( which encodes yeast actin ) , RVS167 and RVS161 ( a homologue of RVS167 ) ( the latter two genes individually or in combination ) , did not rescue the growth defects of the ∆ sjl1 ∆ sjl2 and the ∆ sjl2 ∆ sjl3 double mutants . The genetic interaction between SJL1 and SAC6 strongly suggests that the products of these genes may have opposing effects on the actin cytoskeleton . The ∆ sjl1 ∆ sjl2mutant exhibits aberrant mitochondrial organization As part of a systematic characterization of the ∆ sjl mutant strains , we stained cells with DAPI , a DNA - speciﬁc dye . This revealed normal nuclear localization and segregation during cell division . Surprisingly , the mitochondria , which were also stained by DAPI , revealed an abnormal morphology in the ∆ sjl1 ∆ sjl2 double mutant . This phenotype was conﬁrmed by mitochondrial labeling with the vital dyes DiOC 6 ( Fig . 6 ) and mitotracker ( not shown ) . While mitochondria exhibited the typical tubule - like structure in wild type ( Fig . 6a , a ¢ ) and the ∆ sjl1 ∆ sjl3 and ∆ sjl2 ∆ sjl3 mutants ( not shown ) , they appeared as random dots in the ∆ sjl1 ∆ sjl2 strain ( Fig . 6b , b ¢ ) . It is important to note that mitochondrial morphology , which is tightly linked to actin function ( Drubin et al . , 1993 ) , was not affected in the ∆ sjl2 ∆ sjl3 mutant , in spite of the aberrant actin Fig . 5 . Deletion of SJL1 suppresses the temperature - sensitive growth phenotype of sac6 . A mutant in sac6 ( BS325 ; Singer - Krüger and Ferro - Novick , 1997 ) was crossed to ∆ sjl1 ( BS627 ) . After sporulation of the heterozygous diploid , tetrad analysis was performed on colonies that grew at 25°C . sac6 and ∆ sjl1 were followed by the ts growth and Ura + phenotypes , respectively . One representative tetrad is shown . ( a ) sac6 ∆ sjl1 ; ( b ) sac6 ; ( c ) ∆ sjl1 ; ( d ) wild type . Fig . 6 . Abnormal mitochondrial morphology in the ∆ sjl1 ∆ sjl2 double mutant .

It should also be noted that mitochondria were present in the growing buds of all the three sjl double mutants including ∆ sjl1 ∆ sjl2 . This indicates that mitochondrial inheritance , another process which involves actin ( Drubin et al . , 1993 ) , is preserved . DISCUSSION The goal of this study was to use yeast genetics to test the hypothesis that synaptojanin family members play a role in endocytosis , consistent with the proposed role of synaptojanin 1 in the endocytosis of synaptic vesicles ( McPherson et al . , 1994b ; Haffner et al . , 1997 ) . To this aim we have tested the effect of SJL deletions on ﬂuid - phase and receptor - mediated endocytosis . We report the occurrence of an endocytosis defect in the ∆ sjl2 ∆ sjl3 mutant and of a severe impairment of endocytosis in the ∆ sjl1 ∆ sjl2 mutant . In either strain both ﬂuid - phase uptake ( LY ) and receptor - mediated endocytosis ( a - factor internalization ) were affected , suggesting an impairment of some key aspect of the endocytic machinery . However , the different phenotypes of the two mutants indicate at least partially distinct defects rather than a different penetrance of the same defect . A profound alteration of the cellular morphology , with a massive increase of the cell surface area , occurs exclusively in the ∆ sjl1 ∆ sjl2 mutant . Deep invaginations of the plasma membrane must reﬂect an imbalance between exocytosis and endocytosis which is not compensated by a parallel increase in overall growth . Our data strongly support the hypothesis that the invaginations of the ∆ sjl1 ∆ sjl2 strain result from a selective impairment of endocytosis , because secretion of invertase was found to occur at wild - type levels . Although the plasma membrane invaginations were clearly unique to the ∆ sjl1 ∆ sjl2 mutant , they could represent an exaggeration of furrow - like invaginations often visible even in wild - type cells ( Prescianotto - Baschong and Riezman , 1998 ) . These invaginations appear to be the sites at which receptor - mediated endocytosis takes place ( J . Mulholland and D . Botstein , personal communication ) . Since ∆ sjl2 ∆ sjl3 and rvs167 do not exhibit the abnormal surface invaginations , a balance between exocytosis and endocytosis is likely to be maintained in these mutants , as in several previously reported endocytosis mutants ( Raths et al . , 1993 ; Kübler and Riezman , 1993 ; Munn et al . , 1995 ) , in spite of the kinetic delay in endocytosis . In some other endocytosis mutants , however , a moderate deepening of normal cell surface invaginations was observed ( Prescianotto - Baschong and Riezman , 1998 ; Wendland et al . , 1996 ) . Very deep and narrow plasmalemmal infoldings , reminiscent of those present in the D sjl1 D sjl2 cells , were previously observed in Drosophila melanogaster and mammalian cells in which dynamin function is impaired by mutations , transfection or antibody injections ( Koenig and Ikeda , 1990 ; Damke et al . , 1995 ; Henley et al . , 1998 ) . Thus , the consequence of the simultaneous deletion of SJL1 and SJL2 on cell surface morphology of yeast cells is consistent with the putative link between the function of dynamin and synaptojanin 1 in mammals ( McPherson et al . , 1994b , 1996 ; Haffner et al . , 1997 ; Mundigl et al . , 1998 ) . In animal cells with impaired dynamin function these infoldings often terminate in a clathrin - coated bud ( Koenig and Ikeda , 1990 ; Henley et al . , 1998 ) , as if the infolding were generated by the internalization of a bud which cannot undergo ﬁssion . It is of interest that the tips of surface infoldings in the ∆ sjl1 ∆ sjl2 mutant also have a peculiar cytoplasmic undercoating which appears as an unstained area ( arrowheads in Fig . 3g ) . The plasmalemmal invaginations of the ∆ sjl1 ∆ sjl2 mutant generate ‘pseudo - intracellular compartments’ . This ultrastructural feature may explain some of the puzzling results obtained by the classical endocytosis assays . The spots of LY that were visible at the cell periphery of mutant cells after exposure to the dye may represent partially trapped LY which had not been truly internalized , since most of the dye could be removed by extensive washes at 0°C in the presence of NaN 3 . Likewise , a - factor trapped in these compartments may be artifactually scored as ‘internalized’ by the endocytosis assay and may contribute to the higher level of uptake at 1 minute , in spite of minimal further uptake . Furthermore , accumulation of FM4 - 64 was enhanced , rather than decreased , in the mutant , due to the concentration of this amphipatic dye in the invaginations . Therefore , although decreased cellular labeling by FM4 - 64 was successfully used to isolate new yeast endocytosis mutants ( Wendland et al . , 1996 ) , at least one such mutant exhibits an opposite phenotype in this assay ( see also Srinivasan et al . , 1997 ) . In agreement with a putative regulatory role of phosphoinositides on the function of the actin cytomatrix ( Janmey , 1994 ) , we show that ∆ sjl1 ∆ sjl2 and ∆ sjl2 ∆ sjl3 mutants exhibit budding polarity defects which correlate with morphological alterations of the actin cytoskeleton . Again , reproducible differences in both actin organization and chitin distribution were observed in the two mutants , indicating that distinct synaptojanins have speciﬁc functions in these processes . Deletion of SJL1 , but not of SJL2 and SJL3 , led to the suppression of the temperature - sensitive growth defect of a sac6 mutant strongly indicating a functional link between Sjl1p and actin function . Sac6p , which is 43 % identical to mammalian ﬁmbrin , promotes actin ﬁlament assembly and binds to actin in vivo ( Adams et al . , 1991 ) . Furthermore , it is essential for the internalization step of endocytosis ( Kübler and Riezman , 1993 ) . Similar to our ﬁnding that ∆ sjl1 can suppress sac6 , it has been previously shown that mutants in act1 can suppress sac6 and vice versa ( Adams and Botstein , 1989 ; Adams et al . , 1989 ; Novick and Botstein , 1985 ) . The correlation between endocytic defects , actin cytoskeleton disruption and loss of cell polarity observed for a variety of yeast mutants ( Riezman et al . , 1996 ) indicates that these processes are functionally interrelated . Growing evidence suggests that in mammalian cells both clathrin - dependent and clathrin - independent endocytosis also require the proper function of the actin cytoskeleton ( Lamaze et al . , 1997 ; Mundigl et al . , 1998 ; Schmalzing et al . , 1995 ) . The distinct phenotypes displayed by ∆ sjl1 ∆ sjl2 and ∆ sjl2 ∆ sjl3 not only include endocytosis , plasma membrane morphology and cellular polarity , but also growth ( see Materials and Methods ) . Based on these phenotypes it appears that Sjl2p is the most critical member of three yeast synaptojanin - like proteins for cell physiology , followed by Sjl1p and Sjl3p . The cold - and temperature - sensitive growth phenotypes displayed by ∆ sjl1 ∆ sjl2 , and ∆ sjl2 ∆ sjl3 , respectively , can now be exploited in genetic screens to identify genes with a related function to synaptojanins in yeast . B . Singer - Krüger and others 3355 Synaptojanins in yeast endocytosis An unexpected phenotype of the ∆ sjl1 ∆ sjl2 double mutant was an abnormal mitochondrial morphology . This effect may be indirect and caused by the deep invaginations of the cell surface which may perturb the normal tubulo - reticular structure of yeast mitochondria . However , in view of the suggested functional relationship between synaptojanin 1 and dynamin in mammalian cells , it is of interest that yeast strains harboring mutations in either one of two genes homologous to dynamin , MGM1 and DNM1 ( Jones and Fangman , 1992 ; Gammie et al . , 1995 ) , also exibit an abnormal mitochondrial organization ( Jones and Fangman , 1992 ; Guan et al . , 1993 ; Shaw et al . , 1997 ) . Since dynamin function has been linked to actin ( Witke et al . , 1998 ; Damke et al . , 1995 ; De Camilli et al . , 1995 ) , it is possible that the abnormal mitochondrial morphology in ∆ sjl1 ∆ sjl2 , mgm1 , and dnm1 may be caused by defects in the actin cytoskeleton in these mutants . In conclusion , our data demonstrate that the multiple phenotypes of two sjl double mutants include endocytic defects . These ﬁndings provide the ﬁrst functional piece of evidence supporting the putative role of mammalian synaptojanin 1 , and more generally of phosphoinositide metabolism , in endocytosis . Lack of major defects in sjl single mutants clearly demonstrate that the SJL genes have redundant functions . Nevertheless , the distinct phenotypes exhibited by the three different double mutants also indicate that the SJL genes have only partially overlapping roles and act on distinct pools of inositol metabolites . This is consistent with the evolutionary divergence of the three genes at their COOH - terminal domains , i . e . the domains which are thought to play an important role in subcellular targeting . It should be noted that Sjl2p , which our studies suggest as the most critically required synaptojanin family member for endocytosis , is the Sjl protein more closely related in overall structure and primary amino acid sequence to synaptojanin 1 . An interplay of yeast studies and studies on vesicle recycling at the synapse and in other systems of higher eukaryotes will help to further elucidate the function of each member of the synaptojanin family .
