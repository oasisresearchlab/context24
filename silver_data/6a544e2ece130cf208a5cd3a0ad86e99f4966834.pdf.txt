Proteins that are simultaneously capable of regulating actin dynamics and sensing or inducing mem - brane curvature are predicted to have a prominent role . A prototypical example of this type of proteins is the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase substrate of 53 kDa , the founding member of a recently discovered family of proteins , including missing - in - metastasis and ABBA ( actin - bundling protein with BAIAP2 homology ) . Struc - tural , biochemical and cell biological experiments sup - port the unique role of this family as transducers of signalling , linking the protruding membrane to the underlying actin cytoskeleton . Introduction Cell migration is a remarkably complex process , which relies on the sophisticated decoding of signals in a 3D setting . This is achieved by a tight spatial and temporal coordination of the machineries controlling actin polymer - ization and trafﬁcking of membrane and membrane - bound proteins . Dynamic actin ﬁlament turnover is generally regarded as the means to generate forces for motility [ 1 , 2 ] . Less established is the function of intracellular traf - ﬁcking of membrane and signalling proteins , which can contribute to the acquisition of migratory behaviours in various ways . Accordingly , several possible links between plasma membrane trafﬁcking and actin - based cell move - ment have been proposed These include the delivery of adhesion and signalling molecules to the front of the cells , polarization of the plasma membrane and the generation of membrane ﬂow , which has been proposed as an alternative force generator to propel a cell forward [ 3 ] , although its existence in certain cells has been disputed [ 4 ] . Addition - ally , more recent evidence suggested that internalization and recycling of membrane might also be necessary for a moving cell to adjust the cell surface area continually to match changes in shape [ 5 ] . Finally , a wealth of genetic experiments revealed that intracellular trafﬁcking is crucial to promote spatial restriction of signalling , conﬁning and polarizing key actin regulatory molecules and generating self - controlled feedback loops that ensure univectorial production of actin - based motility forces . These , in turn , are required for the extension of various types of migratory cell protrusions [ 6 – 8 ] , such as ﬁlopodia and lamellipodia . Within this context , a prominent role is predicted to be exerted by proteins that have a dual role in membrane dynamics and in the actin cytoskeleton , which contribute to actin dynamics by controlling the architectural organ - ization of the actin ﬁlament meshwork , and sense mem - brane curvature . A prototypical example of this type of protein is insulin receptor tyrosine kinase substrate of 53 kDa ( IRSp53 ) , also known as the binding partner of the brain - speciﬁc angiogenesis inhibitor 1 - associated protein 2 ( BAIAP2 ) [ 9 – 11 ] , and its family members , whose emerging structural , biochemical and cell biological functions sup - port their unique role as transducers of signalling linking the deformation of the plasma membrane caused by pseu - dopod extension , with the underlying actin cytoskeleton . Here , we review the most recent evidence illustrating the molecular mechanisms through which IRSp53 might func - tion in regulating the extension of different types of migratory protrusions in response to distinct signalling pathways . The IRSp53 family of proteins : a structural outlook IRSp53 is the founding member of a family of proteins featuring the presence of the so - called IRSp53 and missing - in - metastasis ( MIM ) [ 12 ] homology domain , hereafter referred to as the IRSp53 – MIM domain ( IMD ) . This domain , which belongs to the larger family of the Bin – amphipysin – Rvs167 ( BAR ) domain ( see later ) , binds to both actin and lipids . Members of this family can be sub - divided in two groups , the IRSp53 - like and MIM - like members ( Figure 1a ) . The former , which is the focus here , are invariably characterized by a domain organization typical of signalling proteins that includes in addition to IMD a canonical SH3 domain plus variable protein – protein interaction surfaces ( Figure 1a ) . The MIM group includes two genes , MIM and ABBA [ 13 ] . These genes , at Review Corresponding author : Scita , G .

Three mammalian genes , IRSp53 , insulin receptor tyrosine kinase substrate [ IRTKS ; alsoknownasBAI1 - associatedprotein2 - like1 ( BAIAP2L1 ) ] and the poorly characterized FLJ22582 ( also known a BAIAP2L2 ) comprise the IRSp53 subfamily [ 16 ] ( Figure 1a ) . In evolutionary terms , one ancestral IRSp53 - like protein can be found both in the amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum and in Drosophila melanogaster but not in uni - cellular organisms , such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae . In addition to IMD and SH3 domains , IRSp53 family members contain either N - terminal leucine repeats or a C - terminal Cdc42 and Rac interactive binding motif ( CRIB ) domain , respectively ( Figure 1a ) . In both of these organisms , there have been no genetic and functional studies , so we have few clues as to the role of these proteins . Notably , the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans possesses only one gene encoding an IMD - containing protein and is devoid of any other , additional obvious domains , suggesting that the IMD must exert most of the biological ancestral functions of this gene family . Gene duplication is likely to have occurred in evol - ution , resulting in the generation of three highly homolo - gous IRSp53 - like and two MIM - like genes in vertebrates , in which additional variable domain signatures started to appear , such as WH2 domains and CRIBs , probably reﬂect - ing the involvement of these proteins in distinct , yet to be characterized signalling pathways . Figure 1 . The IMD domain - containing protein family . ( a ) Phylogenetic analyses of IMD domain - containing proteins . Protein sequences were retrieved either from the GenBank database or predicted from genomic sequence assemblies from the indicated organisms using GeneWise ( http : / / www . ebi . ac . uk / Wise2 / ) .

Review Trends in Cell Biology Vol . 18 No . 2 53 The gene encoding IRSp53 undergoes multiple and complex splicing events [ 19 ] ( Figure 1 in the supple - mentary material online ) . Four isoforms ( IRSp53 L - , M - , S - and T - forms ) have been identiﬁed , which differ mainly in their C - termini . The S - and L - forms were found to be mainly expressed in the brain , and they differ in the presence of a postsynaptic density - 95 ( PSD - 95 ) – discs large – zone occludens - 1 ( PDZ ) - binding motif in the S - form or a WH2 domain in the L - form , which is almost completely maintained in the M - form ( Figure 1b ) . Intriguingly , the T - form of IRSp53 , lacking both motifs , was found to be expressed only in the human breast cancer cell line MCF7 [ 17 , 18 ] . An alternative spliced version of the S - form has been characterized in mice , which lacks part of the CRIB domain [ 19 ] . Structure of the IMD The N - terminal IMD region is the most conserved region among the IRSp53 and MIM families of proteins [ 16 ] . The IMD has actin ﬁlament - binding and membrane - binding and - deforming abilities [ 16 , 20 – 22 ] . However , the IMD of IRSp53 was originally identiﬁed as an activated Rac - bind - ing ( RCB ) domain [ 23 , 24 ] . Conversely , the IMD of MIM was shown to have afﬁnity for both the activated and inactivated forms of Rac [ 25 ] . Sequence analysis of IMD suggests that it has a weak similarity with the BAR domain and an extended fps / fes related - Cdc42 - interacting protein 4 ( ( FER - CIP4 ) homology ( FCH ) ( EFC ) – FCH and BAR ( F - BAR ) domain . The BAR / F - BAR domain binds to membranes of a speciﬁc curvature and deforms spherical liposomes into narrow tubules in vitro [ 26 – 28 ] . Some of the BAR / F - BAR domain - containing proteins , such as amphiphysin and formin - binding protein 17 ( FBP17 ) , are involved in endocytosis , where they aid the process of inward invagination . The unique banana - shaped structure of the BAR domain is composed of six - helix bundles , and each bundle is orga - nized into a dimer . Interestingly , the ends and the concave surface of the dimer are rich in positively charged lysine and arginine residues , which are responsible for mem - brane binding of the BAR domain ; in particular , the distri - bution of positively charged residues along the concave surface is complementary to the negatively charged cur - vature of the invaginated cell membrane to which the BAR domain binds ( Figure 2a , b ) . Several different structures for the IMD have been determined [ 15 , 20 – 22 ] . As suggested from the weak sequence similarity to the BAR domain , the IMD also comprises a six - helix - bundle dimer . In contrast to the banana - shaped dimeric BAR domain , there are kinks in the helix of the IMD , and its shape is that of a straight dimer ( the IMD forms a ‘zeppelin - shaped’ dimer ) . There - fore , the IMD is also called the inverse - BAR ( I - BAR ) domain . Additionally , the positively charged amino acids are concentrated exclusively at the ends of the IMD [ 15 , 20 – 22 ] and are important for binding the IMD Figure 2 .

However , the presence of such mechanisms in BAR domain - and IMD - induced membrane deformations has not been demonstrated so far .

The membrane protrusions or invaginations are hypothesized to be generated by the spiral formation of the domains ( c ) . Review Trends in Cell Biology Vol . 18 No . 2 54 to the membrane , to actin and to the small GTPase Rac ( Figure 2 and Figure 1 in the supplementary material online ) . Other positively charged amino acids form two straight ‘lipid - binding lines’ on the complementary sur - faces of the IMD of IRSp53 [ 20 , 22 ] . Only one of these lipid - binding lines is believed to bind to membranes ( Figure 1 in the supplementary material online ) . If we postulate that the membrane binds simultaneously to one of the lipid - binding lines and to the positively charged dimer ends , the resulting three lipid - binding sites would form a convex surface that should enable binding to the outwardly curved membrane protrusions [ 20 , 22 ] . Actin ﬁlaments are thought to bind to amino acids that are also involved in membrane binding , including the ends of the IMD dimer [ 20 – 22 ] . The candidate actin ﬁlament - binding sites are the two lipid - binding lines and the ends of the dimer . Thus , if we assume that the IMD binds to both the membrane and an actin ﬁlament simultaneously , only one or two lipid - binding sites among the four present in the IMD are predicted to associate with the actin ﬁlaments owing to space limitations [ 20 , 22 ] ( Figure 2 ) , suggesting that the proposed actin bundling activity might not occur when the isolated IMD is engaged with the membrane . Other functional domains in the IRSp53 – MIM family of proteins SH3 domain Besides the IMD , there are additional protein – protein interaction domains or motifs in the IRSp53 – MIM family of proteins . A canonical SH3 domain is present exclusively in members of the IRSp53 subfamily , and among them only the SH3 domain of IRSp53 has been subjected to intense investigation . Accordingly , the SH3 domain of IRSp53 was shown to bind to the proline - rich sequences of WASP - family verprolin - homologous protein ( WAVE ) 2 [ 22 , 23 ] , Mena / VASP ( vasodilator - stimulated phosphoprotein ) [ 29 ] , Eps8 [ 30 , 31 ] , mDia [ 32 ] , espin [ 33 ] , dentatorubral - pallidoluysian atrophy protein ( DRLPA ) [ 34 ] , Shank - 1 [ 35 , 36 ] and synaptopodin [ 37 ] . Because the IMD of IRSp53 binds to the membrane and to actin ﬁla - ments , the IMD with the SH3 domain can be viewed as the adaptor that drives the assembly of protein complexes to the actin ﬁlament or to the membrane with a speciﬁc curvature . However , it is still unclear how the binding of SH3 interactors to the membrane or to actin ﬁlaments through IRSp53 is physiologically regulated . The WH2 domain The WH2 domain is known to be an actin monomer - bind - ing domain . Only limited members of the IMD protein group , such as MIM and ABBA - 1 [ 12 , 14 , 25 ] , have WH2 domains . The structure of the WH2 domain of MIM in complex with an actin monomer indicated that it is longer than prototypical WH2 domains , and is in contact with all four subdomains of actin [ 15 ] . Consistent with this latter observation , the sequence of the MIM WH2 domain has greater similarity to the sequences of the ‘longer’ WH2 domain found in thymosin b 4 , Ciboulot or WASP - interact - ing protein ( WIP ) than to those of WASP or WAVE [ 14 , 15 , 38 ] . IRTKS and splice variants of IRSp53 , lacking the C - terminal PDZ - binding motif , also possess a WH2 - like domain , albeit displaying limited sequence conservation to canonical WH2 domains [ 39 ] . It should also be pointed out that , at variance with other cytoskeletal proteins , the WH2 domain in MIM and IRSp53 occurs in isolation at the C - terminal end – that is , it is not immediately preceded by proline - rich sequences or followed by other WH2s . Additionally , unlike the actin monomer - trapping molecule thymosin b 4 and the nucleation - elongation factors WASP and WAVE , MIM and IRSp53 function as scaffolding proteins . Thus , WH2 might facilitate the recruitment of MIM and IRSp53 , in addition to their multiple binding partners , to speciﬁc cytoskeletal networks [ 15 ] . Partial CRIB domain The CRIB domain of IRSp53 is atypical ; it has less amino acid conservation compared with the CRIB of WASP or p21 - activated kinase ( PAK ) [ 29 , 40 ] . Despite this , IRSp53 CRIB binds speciﬁcally to activated Cdc42 but not to activated Rac , which can instead associate with the IMD . Thus , IRSp53 possesses two distinct surfaces med - iating its association with two different GTPases in their GTP - loaded and active states [ 23 , 40 ] , suggesting that IRSp53 can exert an independent ‘effector’ function down - stream of Cdc42 and Rac pathways . Alternatively , both Rac and Cdc42 signalling cascades might converge to , and contribute to , modulation of IRSp53 - mediated biological activity . The mechanisms through which this might occur are still elusive because it remains ill deﬁned whether Rac association can regulate the lipid - , actin - and protein – protein - binding properties of IRSp53 , and scant evidence has suggested that Cdc42 binding can modulate , at least in vivo , the afﬁnity of the SH3 domain for its ligands , in - cluding WAVE2 [ 41 ] . PDZ - binding motifs The PDZ domain was ﬁrst recognized as a novel structural motif in PSD - 95 , the Drosophila discs - large septate junc - tion protein and the epithelial tight - junction protein zonula occludens - 1 ( ZO - 1 ) [ 42 , 43 ] . This motif is implicated in the correct localization and clustering of membrane receptors and ion channel subunits through binding to their C - terminal three residues [ 44 ] . Sequence analysis of proteins that interact with the PDZ motif and random peptide screens [ 45 ] uncovered a consensus sequence of Ser / Thr – X – Val – COO (cid:2) ( STV ) for the PDZ - domain - binding site ( where X represents any amino acid , and Val can be substituted with other hydrophobic residues ) . In some of the IRSp53 isoforms described earlier ( Figure 1b ) , the STV terminal amino acids have been shown to be important for the interaction with PSD - 95 and thus for mediating the engagement of IRSp53 with the large macromolecular PSD complex [ 24 , 46 , 47 ] . Additionally , more recently , the same STV motif has been shown to mediate the interaction of IRSp53 with MALS / Lin - 7 , a member of a larger molecular complex mediating the proper organization of cell – cell adhesion in epithelial cells [ 48 ] . This therefore represents yet another protein – protein interaction surface , expanding the network of interactions in which IRSp53 and its family members seem to participate . The physiological roles of IRSp53 and its contribution to the ﬁnal biological outcome controlled by these various macromolecular Review Trends in Cell Biology Vol . 18 No . 2 55 machineries have yet to be uncovered , and represent the major , pressing questions to be addressed . Biochemical and functional role of IMD - carrying proteins : how the IMD might generate plasma membrane protrusions Work carried out by several laboratories demonstrated that overexpression of IRSp53 in cultured mammalian cells results in the formation of ﬁlopodia - like plasma mem - brane protrusions [ 16 , 29 , 35 , 36 , 40 , 49 ] . Similarly , overex - pression of other IMD family members , namely MIM and IRTKS , promotes the formation of somewhat less extensive membrane protrusions , such as microspikes and mem - brane rufﬂes [ 14 , 21 , 50 ] . Although it is clear that the IMD is responsible for the induction of ﬁlopodia formation by full - length IRSp53 , the mechanism by which this domain promotes the formation of membrane protrusions is still controversial . Initial biochemical studies demon - strated that both IRSp53 and MIM IMDs bind to and bundle actin ﬁlaments [ 16 , 21 ] . Subsequent studies showed relatively weak actin ﬁlament crosslinking activity , as measured by low - speed sedimentation assays , but some - what stronger actin ﬁlament bundling activity , as deter - mined by light and electron microscopy [ 21 , 25 , 51 ] . However , two recent studies suggested that isolated IMDs do not crosslink actin ﬁlaments in physiological conditions [ 15 , 20 ] . Thus , it is possible that the IMD is not a physio - logical actin ﬁlament bundling and crosslinking domain , or that other proteins are required to induce the ﬁlament crosslinking activity of the domain in cells . The latter alternative is supported by a recent study demonstrating that the actin - binding protein , Eps8 , activates and syner - gizes with IRSp53 in mediating actin bundling in vitro and enhances ﬁlopodia formation in vivo [ 31 ] . As described earlier , the IMD shows signiﬁcant struc - tural homology to membrane - binding and – deforming BAR and F - BAR domains [ 15 , 21 , 22 , 27 ] . In cells , full - length IRSp53 localizes to the tips of lamellipodia and ﬁlopodia [ 49 ] . Furthermore , when expressed in cells , the isolated IMDs of IRSp53 and MIM do not localize to ﬁlopodial actin ﬁlament bundles , as would be expected for an F - actin crosslinking protein . Instead , IMDs are found at the plasma membrane surrounding the F - actin bundles [ 20 , 22 ] . These data suggest that in cells , IMDs function in the context of the plasma membrane , possibly serving as a linker and organizer of the underlying actin cytoskeleton . In keeping with this notion , two recent studies demon - strated that IMDs bind to phosphoinositide - rich mem - branes with high afﬁnity and deform them into tubular structures [ 20 , 22 ] . It is also important to note that although disruption of the actin cytoskeleton by latruncu - lin A diminishes the dynamics of the IMD - induced ﬁlopo - dia , both IRSp53 and MIM IMDs can induce membrane protrusions independently of the actin cytoskeleton [ 20 , 22 ] . All of these conclusions are based on studies using isolated IMDs , and thus in the future it will be important to examine whether IMDs also deform membranes in the context of full - length proteins . Furthermore , it will be important to elucidate whether IMDs actually generate membrane curvature in cells or if they simply function as curvature - sensing domains that localize IRSp53 and related proteins to the appropriate sites at the plasma membrane . IRSp53 in the mist of signalling circuitries leading to actin - based cellular protrusions The modular domain organization of IRSp53 family mem - bers suggests that these proteins are likely to take part in a variety of signalling pathways , acting either as scaffolding proteins enabling the assembly and localized restriction of macromolecular signalling units or as bona ﬁde effectors . This latter functional role is supported by the multifaceted role of the isolated IMD possessing both actin - binding ( and possibly - bundling ) , and lipid - binding and - bending activity [ 15 , 16 , 20 – 22 , 51 ] . Strikingly , however , the lack of biochemical and functional data with respect to whether and how the biochemical outputs of this domain are regulated in the context of the full - length protein and by IRSp53 - interacting partners has so far prevented us from building a coherent model to account for the involvement of the IRSp53 IMD domain in signalling pathways . More suggestive , from this point of view , is the growing list of IRSp53 - interacting partners , which provide strong support to the signalling scaffolding and adaptor proper - ties of this protein . According to this view , the lipid - binding and - bending function of the IMD might well serve as a device to anchor IRSp - 53 - mediated multimolecular machi - neries to speciﬁc membrane - associated sites , thus contri - buting to the architectural organization of the actin meshwork and to the spatial restriction of signalling ema - nating from different IRSp53 - interacting small GTPases , such as Rac and Cdc42 . Based on these premises , we can categorized three differentially localized , variably com - posed , IRSp53 - based machineries implicated in distinct biological processes : ( i ) ﬁlopodia formation downstream of Cdc42 ; ( ii ) Rac - mediated lamellipodia extension ( Figure 3 ) and ( iii ) the assembly of the PSD complex in neurons . The Cdc42 – IRSp53 complexes in the formation of ﬁlopodia Filopodia are rod - like membrane protrusions formed by parallel bundles of actin ﬁlaments [ 52 , 53 ] . They are thought to be guiding or exploratory devices probing the space ahead of the protruding leading edge of advancing lamellipodia [ 52 ] . In neurons , ﬁlopodia have been observed at the cortical outer boundaries of growth cones guiding their path , and along neuritis , where they often precede the formation of dendritic spines [ 54 ] . How these protru - sions are initiated is a major question to be addressed . Different mechanisms of ﬁlopodia initiation have been proposed . According to the convergent elongation model , ﬁlopodia are initiated from the cell leading edge , where a few actin ﬁlaments are embedded in a highly branched dendritic array that results from the activity of the actin nucleator complex Arp2 / 3 , coalesced into crosslinked bun - dles [ 55 ] . To initiate these bundles , ﬁlaments must be locally crosslinked and their barbed ends protected from capping . Ena – VASP family proteins have been proposed to fulﬁl this role , localizing at the tips of ﬁlopodia and favour - ing the clustering of ﬁlaments [ 55 , 56 ] . An alternative model invokes the contribution of formins , such as mDia2 , Review Trends in Cell Biology Vol . 18 No . 2 56 which can processively promote the linear elongation of actin ﬁlaments and effectively compete with cappers [ 57 ] . Whatever the case , actin bundling proteins are required to crosslink linear ﬁlaments near the tips of bundles , anchor - ing them to protruding membranes , generating stiff rods which can overcome membrane resilience and the tendency of ﬁlaments to buckle . Within this context , the role of IRSp53 might be crucial . Its involvement in ﬁlopodia or ﬁlopodia - like extension has been documented in various cell lines [ 16 , 29 , 35 , 36 , 40 , 49 ] , including neuronal cells . In all of these cases , the simple ectopic expression of IRSp53 induces ﬁlopodia [ 16 , 29 , 35 , 36 , 40 , 49 ] ; conversely , ablation of the protein by inter - ference RNA ( RNAi ) compromises the ability to extend these protrusions [ 24 , 31 ] . Finally , localization studies of endogenous and ﬂuorescently labelled IRSp53 revealed that it is prominently localized both to ﬁlopodia and to lamellipodia tips [ 49 ] , further strengthening its implica - tion in these migratory structures . What are the mechanisms through which IRSp53 func - tions in ﬁlopodia ? The direct association of IRSp53 to Cdc42 through its CRIB , and to a variety of actin - binding proteins ( e . g . mDia2 , Mena , Eps8 ) , through its SH3 domain , provides a reasonable basis on which to propose the existence of a Cdc42 – IRSp53 – actin - binding protein circuitry crucial for regulated ﬁlopodia formation ( Figure 3 ) . Accordingly , the induction of ﬁlopodia for - mation by Cdc42 in ﬁbroblasts depends on the integrity of the IMD and is enhanced by Ena – VASP proteins [ 29 ] . Cdc42 - mediated ﬁlopodia are optimally induced when both IRSp53 and Eps8 , which function in synergy to promote actin bundling , are present in HeLa cells [ 31 ] . Notably , Eps8 and Ena – VASP share the ability to bundle actin ﬁlaments , and both synergize with IRSp53 in crosslinking actin ﬁlaments [ 31 , 57 , 58 ] ( G . S . , unpublished ) . Eps8 , how - ever , is also a potent capping protein [ 59 ] , whereas Ena – VASP binds to G - and F - actin [ 60 , 61 ] , and functionally ( but presumably not biochemically ) [ 62 , 63 ] counteracts the actions of capping proteins . This predicts that the dynamics of Eps8 – IRSp53 - and Ena – VASP – IRSp53 - mediated ﬁlopodia might be signiﬁcantly different , suggesting the possibility that these complexes might be utilized differentially by cells , depending on ﬁlopodia dynamics , length and lifetime . This scenario could become even more complex if physiological evidence is provided in support of a recently identiﬁed SH3 - mediated interaction between mDia2 and IRSp53 [ 32 ] . This association can potentially link Cdc42 to mDia2 and be sufﬁcient for the generation of linear actin ﬁlaments . Finally , it is likely that other interactors with the SH3 domain of IRSp53 , such as Shank - 1 [ 35 , 36 ] or synaptopodin [ 37 ] , might also inﬂuence its ﬁlopodia - forming ability , competing with Eps8 , Ena – VASP or mDia2 , and thus ultimately affecting the formation of ﬁlopodia in ways that remain to be fully elucidated . The Rac – IRSp53 – WAVE circuitry In addition to ﬁlopodia , lamellipodia are another well - characterized actin - based structure typical of migrating cells . Lamellipodia are ﬂat and broad membrane protru - sions , in which the supporting actin meshwork is archi - tecturally organized in highly branched arrays of actin ﬁlaments [ 1 ] . The generation of this actin network is brought about by activation , mediated by Rac [ 64 ] , of Figure 3 . Irsp53 - based signalling circuitry regulating filopodia and lamellipodia extension . ( a ) Proposed model of the circuitry linking Cdc42 to the IRSp53 - based actin regulatory complex leading to the formation of filopodia . IRSp53 can associate with activated Cdc42 , a step required for filopodia formation , physically connecting this GTPase to Eps8 ( an actin capper and bundling protein ) [ 31 ] , the Ena – Mena – VASP family of proteins [ 29 ] or to the linear elongator of actin filaments mDia2 [ 32 ] . These alternative IRSp53 - based complexes , localized to the plasma membrane , are likely to contribute to the generation and proper architectural organization of the linear actin bundles interconnected through these complexes to the membrane protrusions giving rise to filopodia . See text for further details . ( b ) Role of IRSp53 in mediating , through WAVE - based machinery , the extension of lamellipodia . The WAVE - based complex is key for the generationof the Arp2 / 3 - dependent dendritic actin meshwork that supports the protrusion of lamellipodia . Spatially restricted activated Rac , PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 generation and IRSp53 are thought to bind concomitantly to the WAVE complex , contributing to enhancing and confining its actin polymerization activity along the tip of extending protrusion , thus generating the forces required for lamellipodia extension [ 66 , 67 ] . IRSp53 might also be involved in the generation of positive feedbackloops by interacting with guanine nucleotide exchangefactors ( Tiam1 and the Eps8 – Abi1 – Sos - 1 complex ) [ 30 , 69 ] , which leads to sustained Rac activation . Review Trends in Cell Biology Vol . 18 No . 2 57 the branched elongating activity of the Arp2 / 3 complex , which is under the control of the WAVE2 macromolecular machinery [ 65 , 66 ] . WAVE proteins ( WAVE1 , - 2 and - 3 ) are key constituents of a family of nucleation promoting factors that also includes N - WASP and WASP [ 66 , 67 ] . WAVE functions by entering into a stable complex composed of HSPC300 , Abi1 ( Abl - interactor 1 ) , Nap1 ( NCK - associated protein ) and PIR121 ( p53 inducible protein ) , whose assem - bly is required to link the complex physically to activated Rac , and to localize this machinery to the tip of the extend - ing lamellipodia [ 66 , 67 ] . The precise regulation of the WAVE complex in vivo is still a matter of debate [ 68 ] . IRSp53 , through its SH3 domain , was identiﬁed as a direct interactor with the proline - rich region of WAVE2 and shown to weakly promote WAVE2 - mediated actin polymerization activity [ 23 ] . The functional relevance of this association and the contribution of IRSp53 to the regu - lation of the WAVE2 complex has long been elusive . Recently , however , clues have been provided by the demon - stration that IRSp53 , consistent with its lipid - binding abil - ity , is mainly localized along the plasma membrane and enriched on the tips of lamellipodia . Thus , IRSp53 might synergize with Rac and phospholipids in mediating full activation of the WAVE2 complex [ 41 ] . Accordingly , IRSp53 removal impairs , but does not abrogate , lamellipodia for - mation [ 41 ] . Thesedataare consistentwithamodelinwhich the convergence of distinct signalling cascades – Rac – WAVE2 complex , IRSp53 – WAVE2 and phosphatidylinosi - tol ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) - trisphosphate ( PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ( PIP 3 ) – WAVE2 – optimally regulates and possibly spatially restricts the activity of WAVE2 , thus promoting optimal formation of lamellipodia extensions ( Figure 3 ) . In this scenario , the ability of the IRSp53 IMD to sense and promote membrane curvature might work in concert with WAVE2 - mediated actin polymerization , resulting in effective net extension of lamellipodia . An additional level of regulation exerted by IRSp53 on thispathway isalso suggestedby the ﬁnding that IRSp53 can function not only as a Rac effector , but also as a positivemodulatorofRacbyassociatingwithRacactivators , such as the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Tiam [ 69 ] or the Rac – GEF ( guanine nucleotide exchange factor ) complex EPS8 – Abi1 – Sos - 1 [ 30 ] . This suggests that IRSp53 might be the crucial molecule to generate a positive feedback loop , acting both upstream and downstream of Rac and thus contributing to its sustained activation , which might be required for optimal cell migration . IRSp53 as a component of the PSD complex in spine morphogenesis Additional actin - based , specialized membrane protrusions found in neurons are dendritic spines . Dendritic spines are postsynaptic actin - rich protrusions implicated in the regu - lation of the structure , function , and plasticity of glutama - tergic synapses [ 70 , 71 ] . The generation of excitatory synapses in the central nervous system requires a complex assembly process in which elements of the postsynaptic receptor apparatus are assembled at postsynaptic sites on dendrites , often on the heads of dendritic spines . During maturation , postsynaptic proteins accumulate at the synapse , as exempliﬁed in several studies by the appear - ance of clusters of the most typical postsynaptic marker PSD - 95 [ 72 ] . Through an intricate network of protein interactions , a large protein complex of up to 100 proteins is assembled at the heads of the spines , around the PSD - 95 – transmitter receptor complex [ 73 ] , which has been termed the PSD . The function of the PSD seems to be to link postsynaptic receptors physically to signalling mol - ecules , and to provide stable attachment of the receptors to the actin - based cytoskeleton of the dendritic spine . IRSp53 was found , almost concomitantly with its discovery , to be expressed in the synapse - rich molecular layer of the cerebellum and to be highly concentrated at the synapses of cultured hippocampal neurons [ 11 ] . Consistent with this localization , IRSp53 isoforms containing a PDZ - binding motif were reported to associate directly with PSD - 95 [ 24 , 46 ] , whereas the IRSp53 SH3 domain mediates the interaction with Shank - 1 [ 35 , 36 ] . Shank proteins ( Shank - 1 – 3 , also known as SSTRIP , ProSAP , synamon or CortBP ) constitute another group of postsynaptic scaffolding mol - ecules which link transmitter receptors to actin - binding proteins [ 74 ] and function as potent regulators of spine morphogenesis [ 75 ] . IRSp53 can drive the assembly of a trimeric complex functioning as a bridge between Shank - 1 and PSD - 95 [ 24 , 46 ] . Importantly , the formation of this assembly is controlled by Cdc42 , which by associating with IRSp53 CRIB promotes conformational changes that expose the IRSp53 proline - rich surface , enabling the inter - action with Shank - 1 and the formation of a trimeric ( Shank - 1 – IRsp53 – PSD - 95 ) , Cdc42 signalling complex [ 24 , 46 ] . Consistent with this key role of IRSp53 , interfer - ence with its function , either by increased expression or through its removal by RNAi in cultured hippocampal neurons , signiﬁcantly affects spine density , size and morphology [ 24 ] . Whether these crucial functional roles of IRSp53 in cultured cells are also reﬂected by its import - ance in the whole organism awaits the generation and analysis of mouse models in which IRSp53 genes , and possibly some of its family members , are knocked out . Finally , it is predicted that , in both ﬁlopodia and lamelli - podia , the lipid - and actin - binding features of the IRSp53 IMD will be found to be important in the proper regulation of spine morphogenesis in ways that have so far not been explored . In these cases , the availability of speciﬁc mutants impaired in IMD lipid association will be instrumental in clarifying whether IRSp53 in PSD is a central player at the crossroads of the signalling network linking the actin cytoskeleton and membrane dynamics . Summary and perspectives IRSp53 and MIM family members are emerging as proteins that possess all of the structural features to serve as physical linkers between membrane and actin dynamics . This is due , on the one hand , to the unique and peculiar ability of the IMD domain to sense convex curvature , induce outwardly oriented membrane protru - sions , and bind to and bundle actin ﬁlaments . On the other hand , protein – protein interaction motifs , such as the SH3 domain , and CRIB , proline - rich and PDZ - binding regions , point to a role for the IRSp53 family of proteins as the convergent and integrating node of different membrane - bound , actin - regulatory machineries capable of transdu - cing RhoGTPase - based signalling to generate a distinct set Review Trends in Cell Biology Vol . 18 No . 2 58 of protrusive structures . Although crystallographic , biochemical and cell biological studies have ﬁrmly estab - lished the functions of these isolated domains , much remains to be understood with respect to how their activity is regulated in the context of the full - length protein and by the various IRSp53 - interacting partners . Investigators addressing this issue will probably reveal new modes and mechanisms for the way that IRSp53 family proteins participate in the transduction of signals leading to the acquisition of migratory phenotypes . Finally , how the cellular roles of IRSp53 family members translate into their functional importance at the organis - mal level remains uncharted territory whose exploration represents one of the major challenges of future investi - gations .
