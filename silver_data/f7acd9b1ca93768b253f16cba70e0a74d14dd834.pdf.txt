A range of small molecules have emerged that interfere with actin dynamics by either binding to polymeric F - actin or monomeric G - actin to stabilize or destabilize filaments or prevent their formation and growth , respectively . Amongst these , the latrunculins , which bind to G - actin and affect polymerization , are widely used as tools to investigate actin - dependent cellular processes . Here , we report a pho - toswitchable version of latrunculin , termed opto - latrunculin ( OptoLat ) , which binds to G - actin in a light - dependent fashion and affords optical control over actin polymerization . OptoLat can be activated with 390 – 490 nm pulsed light and rapidly relaxes to the inactive form in the dark . Light activated OptoLat induced depolymerization of F - actin networks in oligodendrocytes and budding yeast , as shown by fluorescence microscopy . Subcellular control of actin dynamics in human cancer cell lines was demonstrated by live cell imaging . Light - activated OptoLat also reduced microglia surveillance in organotypic mouse brain slices while ramification was not affected . Incubation in the dark did not alter the structural and functional integrity of microglia . Together , our data demon - strate that OptoLat is a useful tool for the elucidation of G - actin dependent dynamic processes in cells and tissues . INTRODUCTION Actin is one of the most abundant proteins in eukaryotic cells and essential to their integrity and dynamics . The actin cyto - skeleton is maintained through a dynamic interplay between globular , monomeric G - actin and filamentous , polymeric F - ac - tin ( Fig . 1a ) . This homeostasis is regulated by numerous actin binding proteins that are involved in a wide variety of signaling cascades . 1 – 3 Actin dynamics can also be altered by small mole - cules , which can have stabilizing or destabilizing effects on F - actin . 4 Stabilizers , such as phalloidin and jasplakinolide , bind to the filaments and prevent depolymerization . 5 – 7 The cytochalas - ins bind to the terminal monomers on a filament ( barbed end ) , preventing further polymerization . Amongst the actin destabi - lizing natural products , latrunculins A and B stand out by their unique binding site and mechanism of action . Latrunculins A and B bind G - actin in the nucleotide binding cleft between sub - domains 2 and 4 ( Fig . 1b / c ) . 8 The binding of latrunculin in this site prevents conformational changes that are crucial for the in - corporation of G - actin into the polymerizing filament . 8 The main mechanism of action is therefore the sequestration of actin monomers . Additionally , latrunculin A can be involved in the active severing of filaments . 9 The study of actin dynamics in cells and tissues is challenging because of the many factors control the remodeling of the dy - namic actin networks . To address some of these challenges , we have previously introduced photoswitchable versions of the actin stabilizer jasplakinolide that allow for the reversible stabi - lization of actin filaments with sub - cellular precision . 10 , 11 Figure 1 : Actin turnover is inhibited by Latrunculin binding to G - actin . a ) Schematic representation of actin turnover ( treadmilling ) b ) Latrunculins bind G - actin above the ATP binding cleft ( pdb : 2q0u ) . c ) Chemical structures of latrunculins A and B . barbed end ( + ) a c b O HN S O O O latrunculin A Me OH H O HN S O Me O O latrunculin B H OH ATP ADP actin ATP actin ADP ADP + P i actin Although jasplakinolide - based probes have been used to the study the effect of F - actin stabilization on cytoskeletal function , actin dynamics in cells also depend on the highly regulated G - actin pool . 12 G - actin dependent remodeling of actin , for instance during cell migration , takes place within seconds - minutes . 13 The investigation of such processes requires tools that allow for the modulation of the G - actin pool at the time scales of the bio - logical processes under investigation . Here , we describe optical probes that are complementary to the F - actin stabilizers previ - ously introduced and derived from the G - actin binders latrun - culin A and B . Our photoswitchable version of latrunculin , OptoLat , can sequester G - actin monomers in a light dependent , reversible fashion leading to spatially and temporally confined breakdown of actin networks . We show that actin dynamics can not only be altered in cultured human cancer cell lines with OptoLat , but also in mammalian oligodendrocytes and micro - glia , as well as the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae . RESULTS Design and Synthesis . We based the design of opto - latruncu - lins on published x - ray crystal structures and known structure - activity relationship studies . 14 – 18 Latrunculins bind G - actin right next to the nucleoside binding cleft between subdomains 2 and 4 and inhibit the conformational twist that is essential for incor - poration of ATP - bound G - actin into F - actin ( Fig 2a ) . 8 Their thi - oazolidinone core and hemiacetal engages in hydrogen bonding with the protein whereas the lipophilic macrocycle is predomi - nantly involved in hydrophobic interactions ( Fig . 2a ) . 17 – 19 Figure 2 : a ) Interactions of latrunculin B with the G - actin . b ) Chemical structures of modified or truncated latrunculins identified in SAR studies . Structure - activity relationship studies have identified certain modifications of latrunculins that retain bioactivity . For in - stance , acetal 1 , derived from latrunculin itself was shown to be a 1 . 0 μM inhibitor in biochemical studies . 16 The fully synthetic derivative , 8 - Nor - latrunculin B , was found to cause actin dis - ruption at μM concentrations . 20 Seco derivatives such as the benzoate 2 were also found to be active , albeit with slightly re - duced potency . 20 Based on this knowledge , we designed the photoswitchable de - rivatives shown in Fig . 3a . These include photoswitchable ace - tals such as 3 and 4 , which retain the macrocycle and were based on 1 , as well as azobenzene and diazocine esters such as 5 and 6 , inspired by 2 . To increase the steric clash between the mole - cule and protein by photoisomerization of the diazine bond , we also installed meta and ortho derivatives 7 and 8 . Concerned about the stability of esters , we explored derivatives bearing aryl ethers that had not been previously described . In addition to metabolic stability , aryl ethers would also bring the pho - toswitch deeper into the protein pocket which could increase steric effects . To this end , we synthesized azobenzenes 9 and 10 and diazocine 11 . In the next iteration , we aimed at increasing the bulk of the photoswitch by introducing different functional - ities such as oxirane , trimethoxy and N - benzyl aryls on the pho - toswitch , generating aryl ethers 12 – 15 . Amongst these 14 , bearing a para N - benzyl azobenzene photoswitch , emerged as the most useful compound and was termed OptoLat . The synthesis of OptoLat ( 14 ) ( Fig . 3b ) started with a titanium tetrachloride mediated aldol addition of enantiomerically pure aldehyde 16 to PMB - protected thioazolidinone 17 . As de - scribed by Fürstner , acid mediated silyl deprotection resulted in cyclization and gave a separable ( 1 . 25 : 1 ) mixture of hemiace - tals ( S ) and ( R ) - 19 . 21 ( S ) - 19 was converted into the methyl acetal following oxidative PMB deprotection . 21 , 22 Subsequent Mitsunobu reaction with azobenzene 21 under optimized con - ditions using TMAD , followed by hydrolysis , gave OptoLat in good overall yield . Photoswitchable acetals 3 and 4 were procured from the corre - sponding hemiacetals as described in the Supporting Infor - mation . Aryl ethers 5 – 6 were made by Mitsunobu reactions from ( S ) - 19 . Ether derivatives 9 , 11 – 13 and 15 were obtained by similar synthetic strategies as OptoLat . 10 was accessed by S N Ar from ( R ) - 19 . Initial photophysical and biological evaluation . All pho - toswitchable latrunculins were characterized for their photo - physical properties ( see Supporting Information ) . Due to its para amino substituent , OptoLat showed the most red - shifted absorption spectrum ( λ max trans ca . 450 nm ) and fastest thermal relaxation ( t 1 / 2 < 2 s in DMSO ) . 23 , 24 trans OptoLat can be effi - ciently activated with wavelengths between 390 and 490 nm ( Fig . 4e ) . The activation efficiency was determined by NMR with in situ irradiation using ultra high - power LEDs ( see SI ) . The highest ratio of cis isomer was reached with 460 nm ( ca . 67 % ) . Upon irradiation with 390 nm ca . 46 % cis and 520 nm ca . 26 % cis were obtained ( Fig . 4f ) . The cis isomer was short - lived ( t 1 / 2 ca . 1 . 6 s , Fig . 4g ) which resulted in complete deacti - vation of the photoswitch in the absence of light within seconds . Switching was fully reversible and did not show fatigue ( Fig . 4h ) . Next , we evaluated our photoswitches using light - dependent cell proliferation ( MTT ) assays in HeLa cells . Acetals 3 and 4 , derived from phenethyl latrunculin A ( 1 ) , were found to be completely inactive . Seco esters 5 – 8 , proved to be active , albeit with high EC 50 values compared to macrocyclic reference com - pounds ( e . g . 8 - Nor - latB ) . However , they did not produce any light - dependent antiproliferative activity . Their methyl acetals , which are synthetic intermediates , were completely inactive ( 5 O HN S O O O Me O H O HN S O O O H OH 1 2 O HN S O O O 8 - Nor - LatB H OH a b OMe and 7 OMe ) . Azoaryl ether 9 showed a small difference in light versus dark activity ( Fig . 3b ) . However , other modifi - cations of the photoswitch including the incorporation of an or - tho azobenzene ( 10 ) and a diazocine ( 11 ) , as well as more bulky substituents in 12 and 13 did not lead to a widening in the pho - topharmacological window . This was also true for “iso“ - Optolat 15 which has increased steric bulk by virtue of its ben - zyl substituent . Gratifyingly , its isomer OptoLat ( 14 ) , which has desirable photophysical and thermal properties , proved to be virtually inactive in the dark but became highly active upon irradiation with blue light ( Fig . 3c / d ) . Therefore , our detailed biological investigations focused on this photoswitchable form of latrunculins A / B . Cell proliferation assays across different cell lines showed that OptoLat has an EC 50 of 2 . 5 - 4 . 1 μM ( see SI ) . As such , it is about three times less active than latrunculin B itself . Compared to 8 - Nor - lat B , however , OptoLat showed 2 . 5 times higher antiproliferative activity in our HeLa assays ( Fig . 4a / c ) Figure 2 : Photoswitchable latrunculin derivatives and synthesis of OptoLat . a ) Photoswitchable latrunculin derivatives synthesized . b ) and c ) Synthetic route towards OptoLat .

Shaping actin - based structures in oligodendrocytes and budding yeast cells . Next , we investigated , whether the strong antiproliferative effect indeed resulted from the destabilization of actin networks in different cell types . HeLa cells treated with OptoLat and kept in the dark showed normal actin structures , which broke down upon pulsed irradiation with 410 nm within 24 h . The quantification of these results , however , was difficult since breakdown of the actin network also affects the size and shape in HeLa cells . We therefore turned to oligodendrocytes , glial cells that develop extensive actin networks during their maturation but do not require actin to maintain their structural integrity . 25 This feature makes them an ideal cell type for testing actin perturbing agents like OptoLat . We treated rat oligoden - drocytes with escalating doses of OptoLat . Following 6 hours of OptoLat activation ( pulsed irradiation with 430 nm ) , we ob - served a significant decrease in filamentous actin at all OptoLat doses as measured by phalloidin staining ( Fig . 5a ) . The degree of actin disassembly was similar to the degree of disassembly seen in response to treatment with 100 nM Latrunculin A ( Fig . 5b ) . We observed no difference between levels of filamentous actin in oligodendrocytes treated with OptoLat that were kept in the dark , or DMSO , demonstrating the lack of basal activity of trans OptoLat . Since actin is highly conserved across species , we wondered whether OptoLat is also active in yeast cells . In budding yeast ( S . cerevisiae ) , there are three major actin - containing structures : actin patches , contractile rings , and actin cables . Ac - tin patches are endosomes bearing an F - actin coat that localize to the bud ( daughter cell ) 26 . Contractile rings drive separation of mother and daughter cells during cell division , in yeast as in other eukaryotes , and localize to bud neck . Actin cables are ac - tin bundles that assemble in the bud and extend along the mother - bud axis . They are essential for cell proliferation for their function as tracks for transport of organelles and other cel - lular constituents from mother to daughter cells during cell di - vision 27 , 28 . Finally , actin cables are dynamic structures that un - dergo rapid turnover and treadmilling from their site of assem - bly in the bud toward the mother cell 29 . As a result , they highly sensitive destabilization by latrunculin 30 . One of the advantages of a fast - relaxing photoswitchable actin destabilizer is that it could allow for the modulation of actin dy - namics with temporal precision . Therefore , we monitored the effect of OptoLat on yeast actin cables by measuring the fluo - rescence intensity of F - actin in fluorochrome - coupled phal - loidin - stained actin cables . Treatment of budding yeast cells with OptoLat in the dark or with DMSO in the dark or with illumination at 430 nm had no detectable effect on actin cables . By contrast , activation of OptoLat with pulsed blue light ( 430 nm ) resulted in a rapid , time - dependent decrease in the F - actin content in actin cables ( Fig . 5c , d ) . Indeed , we observe a significant decrease in actin cables within 5 min of OptoLat compound λ ( trans - cis ) EC 50 ( light ) EC 50 ( dark ) Δ 3 – 370 nm > 100 μM > 100 μM 4 – 370 nm > 100 μM > 100 μM 7 OMe – 370 nm > 100 μM > 100 μM 7 – 370 nm 35 . 6 μM 38 . 2 μM 10 – 380 nm 25 . 4 μM > 25 μM 11 – 410 nm 19 . 4 μM 27 . 8 μM 12 – 390 nm 36 μM 40 μM 15 – 380 nm 19 μM 28 . 8 μM O HN S O OH H O cis OptoLat ( active ) N N N O 390 – 490 nm k B T t 1 / 2 = 1 . 6 s trans OptoLat ( inactive ) O HN S O OH H O N N N O latrunculin A N / A N / A 0 . 1 μM N / A latrunculin B N / A 1 . 6 μM N / A N / A 8 - Nor - Lat B 14 μM - 2 - 1 0 1 2 0 25 50 75 100 Log10 concentration [ uM ] H e L a v i a b ili t y [ % ] 380 nm dark - 2 - 1 0 1 2 0 25 50 75 100 Log10 concentration [ uM ] H e L a v i a b ili t y [ % ] 410 nm dark 440 nm 490 nm 525 nm a b c d e g h f 9 OptoLat 300 400 500 600 700 800 0 . 00 0 . 02 0 . 04 Wavelength [ nm ] A b s o r b a n ce [ A .

Since the remodeling of actin net - works is essential to cell migration , 31 – 34 we next investigated whether OptoLat reduces the migration of invasive cancer cells in a light dependent fashion , without showing significant tox - icity . In a wound healing assay , OptoLat did not affect wound closure in the dark ( Fig . 6 ) . Under pulsed - irradiated conditions however , OptoLat significantly reduced wound closure . cis OptoLat was not cytotoxic at concentrations that strongly im - paired cell migration ( 9 μM , 24 h , 440 nm ) ( Fig . 6c ) .

Statistical analysis was performed using Mann - Whitney test . Reversible perturbation of actin dynamics in networks in live cells . The actin networks in lamellipodia show very high turnover rates as these are required to drive cell migration . 31 – 33 To further assess the temporal and spatial precision of OptoLat , we investigated the ability of OptoLat to modulate actin dy - namics in the lamellipodia of migrating cells with subcellular resolution . MDA - MB - 231 cells that stably express mCherry LifeAct , a fluorescent protein that labels F - actin , 35 were incu - bated with OptoLat overnight and kept in the dark . Under these conditions , the cells were directly compared to vehicle controls and behaved normally . The local pulsed irradiation of a region of interest ( ROI ) in the lamellipodium lead to a reduction of protrusion dynamics , which was followed by a breakdown of the actin network . Upon keeping the cells in the dark , actin net - works fully recovered ( Fig . 7 , Supplementary Movie ) . This re - covery was quantified through normalization of LifeAct fluo - rescence in the ROI ( Fig . 7b ) . F - actin fluorescence was steeply reduced upon OptoLat activation . The destructed network per - sisted for several minutes , before a full recovery was observed . Irradiation with 440 nm light alone did not lead to the destruc - tion of the actin network in control cells ( Fig 7 , DMSO control ) . The dynamic changes of actin turnover upon light irradiation can also be clearly visualized using kymographs ( Fig . 7c ) .

Having shown that OptoLat was effective in cultured cells , we tested whether our novel tool could also be applied in complex tissues . As an ex - ample , we investigated microglial surveillance activity in or - ganotypic brain slices in the presence of OptoLat under dark and light - activated conditions . Microglia are highly branched immune cells that constantly scan the brain parenchyma by ex - tending and retracting filopodia - like structures ( surveillance ) . These processes are highly dynamic and depend on actin re - modeling , while the overall shape of the cell ( ramification ) de - pends on microtubule networks . 36 To investigate whether OptoLat affects the behavior of micro - glial cells , we prepared hippocampal slice cultures from mice expressing a red fluorescent protein exclusively in microglia ( Cx3Cr1Cre - tdT ) . We incubated slices cultures with OptoLat overnight and imaged microglia 60 - 80 um below the surface of the slice culture surface with two - photon microscopy ( Fig . 8a ) . From maximum intensity projections taken at two time points ( Δt = 2 min ) we quantified the cell’s shape ( ramification ) and its motility ( surveillance ) . The ramification index is a measure of the ratio of the cell’s perimeter to its area ( Fig . 8b ) , normal - ized to that of a circle of the same area . The surveillance index is a measure of the area ( pixels ) surveyed per unit time ( Fig . 8c ) . In the dark , ramification and surveillance of microglia con - ditioned with OptoLat was not different from vehicle controls . OptoLat activation by pulsed blue light did not affect ramifica - tion ( Fig . 8d ) , but induced a significant reduction in microglia surveillance ( Fig . 8e , f ) . The effect persisted for approx . 10 minutes after the light was turned off , after which surveillance slowly recovered . In the absence of OptoLat , pulsed blue light had no effect on surveillance ( Fig . 8e , f ) 37 These experiments demonstrate that OptoLat can not only be used in single layer cell culture , but also in complex tissue . The compound is well tolerated and does not seem to trigger an adverse immune re - sponse in the dark , which would have caused the retraction of microglia processes during the OptoLat incubation period . t = 0 t = 4 . 3 t = 5 . 8 t = 13 . 7 v v 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 no r m a li z e d fluo r esce n ce ( R O I ) ✱✱✱✱ 5 10 15 - 0 . 5 time [ min ] 2 - way ANOVA n = 3 per condition 440 nm ca . 1 min . 1 pulse / sec . a b c d recovery light activation in ROI local destruction of actin network cell compensates local G - actin loss inside ROI outside ROI t i m e Figure 8 : Light - induced reduction of microglia surveillance in brain slice culture . a ) Fluorescence image ( contrast inverted ) of microglia in hippocampal tissue culture expressing tdTomato . b ) Ramification of microglia was calculated by dividing its perimeter by the surface area . c ) Surveillance was quantified as the sum of areas covered only at one time point ( red + green pixels ) . d ) Ramification of microglia was not affected upon activation of OptoLat .

DISCUSSION Photoswitchable modulators of the cytoskeleton allow for light - induced precise spatial and temporal modulation of cytoskeletal dynamics . Recently , we have developed light - responsive stabi - lizers of F - actin derived from the natural product jasplakoin - lide . 10 , 11 Here , we report generation of a light - activated actin de - stabilizer , the photoswitchable latrunculin derivative OptoLat . Our design of photoswitchable latrunculins was based on the known SAR and several X - ray structures of latrunculin A / B bound to G - actin . This also enabled computational docking studies that pointed to the need for a large photoswitch for op - timal difference in activity . The systematic evaluation of candi - dates with the desired photophysical and thermal properties ul - timately resulted in our most effective compound , OptoLat . This blue - light sensitive , fast - relaxing photoswitch allows for the disassembly of actin structures with high spatiotemporal precision . It is cell permeant and performs well in a variety of cell types , such as yeast cells , human cancer cell lines , rodent oligodendrocytes , and microglia embedded in rodent brain slices . It extends the toolset available for the temporally and spatially restricted modulation of actin dynamics and comple - ments other optogenetic 38 , 39 and photopharmacological 10 , 11 ap - proaches toward controlling the actin cytoskeleton . Its ease of application , enabled by its inactivity in the dark and its rapid , reversible activation by irradiation with blue light , opens a myr - iad of possible applications , from in vitro and cellular assays to the investigation of actin dynamics in more complex tissues , or organisms . Finally , OptoLat serves as a template for “latruncologs” , i . e . structurally simplified latrunculin A / B derivatives that are syn - thetically accessible in ca . 10 steps . The stable aryl ether moiety can be introduced via Mitsunobu reaction of nucleophilic aro - matic substitution enabling the synthesis of a wide range of an - alogs that can be easily diversified .
