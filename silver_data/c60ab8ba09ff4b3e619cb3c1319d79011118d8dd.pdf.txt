The fragile X men - tal retardation protein ( FMRP ) is involved in this process ; here , we show that it acts by inhibiting translation initiation . A binding partner of FMRP , CYFIP1 / Sra1 , directly binds the translation initiation factor eIF4E through a domain that is structurally re - lated to those present in 4E - BP translational inhibi - tors . Brain cytoplasmic RNA 1 ( BC1 ) , another FMRP binding partner , increases the afﬁnity of FMRP for the CYFIP1 - eIF4E complex in the brain . Levels of proteins encoded by known FMRP target mRNAs are increased upon reduction of CYFIP1 in neurons . Translational repression is regulated in an activity - dependent manner because BDNF or DHPG stimula - tion of neurons causes CYFIP1 to dissociate from eIF4Eatsynapses , therebyresultinginprotein synthe - sis . Thus , the translationalrepression activity ofFMRP in the brain is mediated , at least in part , by CYFIP1 . INTRODUCTION The construction of neuronal circuits in the developing brain re - quires the correct assembly of trillions of synaptic connections . Finely regulated protein synthesis may be required to obtain the correct set of proteins at synapses and to modulate their ac - tivity in response to different developmental cues or synaptic stimulations . Indeed , accumulating evidence indicates that local ( synaptodendritic ) protein synthesis modulates synaptic plastic - ity ( Martin et al . , 2000 ; Steward and Schuman , 2003 ; Pfeiffer and Huber , 2006 ; Lin and Holt , 2008 ) . Although the general transla - tional machinery has been found at or near synapses , compo - nents that might control speciﬁc mRNA translation in that com - partment are largely unknown . One protein implicated in neuronal mRNA translation is the fragile X mental retardation protein ( FMRP ) , the absence of which causes the fragile X syndrome ( FXS ) that is characterized at the cellular level by a deﬁcit in synapse maturation . FMRP is an RNA - binding protein with roles in mRNA localization , translation ( Bagni and Greenough , 2005 ) , and stability ( Zalfa et al . , 2007 ; Zhang et al . , 2007 ) . It recognizes mRNAs by directly interacting with them through G quartets and / or U - rich sequences or through small , noncoding RNA adaptors such as the brain cytoplasmic RNA BC1 and possibly microRNAs ( Bagni and Greenough , 2005 ) . Strong evidence indicates that FMRP re - presses translation , although how it does so is enigmatic . Two well - characterized pathways that affect local protein synthesis in neurons involve activation of the TrkB receptors ( Steward and Schuman , 2003 ; Schratt et al . , 2004 ) by the neuro - trophin BDNF and stimulation of the group 1 metabotropic gluta - mate receptors ( mGluRs ) ( Weiler and Greenough , 1993 ) . BDNF treatment activates the translation of two dendritic FMRP target mRNAs that encode Arc / Arg3 . 1 and a CaMKII ( Aakalu et al . , 2001 ; Yin et al . , 2002 ; Zalfa et al . , 2003 ; Schratt et al . , 2004 ) . On the other hand , FMRP is also regulated in response to mGluR stimulation ( Weiler et al . , 1997 ; Antar et al . , 2004 ; Ferrari et al . , 2007 ) ; moreover , long - term depression ( LTD ) , triggered by acti - vation the of mGluRs , is enhanced in the hippocampus of mutant mice lacking FMRP ( Huber et al . , 2002 ) . One possible mechanism for regulating translation is by mod - ulation of the interactions between factors required for transla - tional initiation . Cap - dependent translation , which requires the association of the eIF4A - eIF4G - eIF4E ( eIF4F ) complex with the 5 0 terminal m 7 G cap , is known to be particularly important in neu - rons ( Richter and Sonenberg , 2005 ) . eIF4F assembly is often regulated by the 4E binding proteins ( 4E - BPs ) , which interfere with the eIF4E - eIFG interaction ( Richter and Sonenberg , 2005 ; Richter and Klann , 2007 ; Banko et al . , 2007 ) . eIF4E - binding pro - teins , including 4E - T and eIF4G , share a motif that is responsible 1042 Cell 134 , 1042 – 1054 , September 19 , 2008 ª 2008 Elsevier Inc . for their association with eIF4E . Although 4E - BP1 , BP2 , BP3 , and 4E - T , which all block the eIF4G - eIF4E interaction , probably act as general regulators , other proteins such as Xenopus Mas - kin and Drosophila Cup act as mRNA - speciﬁc 4E - BPs ( Richter and Sonenberg , 2005 ) . Thus far , only Neuroguidin has been identiﬁed as a 4E - BP in the nervous system ( Jung et al . , 2006 ) . Here , we demonstrate that FMRP - mediated repression of translation requires an interaction with Cy toplasmic F MRP I nter - acting P rotein CYFIP1 ( Schenck et al . , 2001 ; Schenck et al . , 2003 ) also known as Sra - 1 ( Kobayashi et al . , 1998 ) , which also binds the cap - binding factor eIF4E . The eIF4E - interacting do - main of CYFIP1 forms the characteristic ‘‘reverse L shaped’’ structure that is also assumed by the canonical eIF4E - binding motif ( Marcotrigiano et al . , 1999 ) . Modulation of CYFIP1 levels affects general mRNA translation in mammalian cells . In the brain , however , CYFIP1formsacomplexwithspeciﬁcFMRP - tar - get mRNAs ; reduced levels of CYFIP1 cause an increase in the synthesis of MAP1B , a CaMKII , and APP , whose mRNAs are known to be regulated by FMRP ( Bagni and Greenough , 2005 ; Hou et al . , 2006 ; Westmark and Malter , 2007 ) . Our data indicate that an eIF4E - CYFIP1 - FMRP complex is present at synapses and that synaptic activity releases CYFIP1 from eIF4E , as well as from bound RNAs , resulting in the alleviation of translation repression . RESULTS FMRP Cosediments with Light mRNPs in a Complex Possibly Containing Both eIF4E and CYFIP1 To investigate the mechanism by which FMRP represses trans - lation in neurons , we examined the distribution of FMRP in su - crose gradients . As shown in Figure 1A , FMRP cofractionated with mRNPs with sedimentation values ranging from 40S to 80S . This proﬁle is similar to the one observed for translational regulators such as mammalian p27 / eIF6 and eIF4E ( Figure 1A and Figure S1 available online ) . Interestingly , CYFIP1 , which in - teracts with FMRP in the cytoplasm ( Schenck et al . , 2001 ) , par - tially cofractionated with FMRP and eIF4E ( Figure 1A , lanes 6 – 9 , and Figure S1 ) . Poly ( A ) - binding protein ( PABP ) , which associates with translationally active and inactive mRNAs , cosedimented with mRNPs ( Figure 1A ) , as well as with heavy polysomes ( Figure S1 ) . These sedimentation experiments suggest that FMRP , CYFIP , and eIF4E might reside in a common complex , perhaps with mRNA . The FMRP - CYFIP1 Complex Binds eIF4E and PABP in Brain We next investigated whether the FMRP - CYFIP1 complex could be retained with eIF4E on m 7 GTP - Sepharose . When the beads were incubated with total brain cytoplasmic extracts , both FMRP and CYFIP1 were recovered from them but only after spe - ciﬁc elution with m 7 GTP ( Figure 1B , lane 3 ) . Whereas the recov - ery of FMRP varied according to salt concentration ( data not shown ) , CYFIP1 recovery was not particularly salt sensitive . PABP was also present in the m 7 GTP eluate , whereas two other proteins not involved in mRNA translation , b - tubulin and reticu - lon 1C , were not speciﬁcally eluted . Interestingly , WAVE , a cyto - plasmic protein interacting with CYFIP1 ( Bogdan et al . , 2004 ) , was also mostly not retained on the beads ( Figure 1B , lane 3 ) , suggesting a speciﬁc function of the FMRP - CYFIP1 - eIF4E complex . Furthermore , neither CYFIP1 nor FMRP ( Figure 1B , compare lanes 5 and 6 ) was present in the last wash ; GTP greatly reduced the yield of the eluted complex ( Figure 1B , lane 7 ) , dem - onstrating the efﬁciency and speciﬁcity of the m 7 GTP elution . The FMRP - CYFIP1 - eIF4E complex was also coprecipitated from brain extracts with speciﬁc FMRP antibody ( Ferrari et al . , 2007 ) . A speciﬁc interaction among FMRP , eIF4E , and CYFIP1 was detected in wild - type ( Figure 1C , lane 4 ) but not in FMR1 knockout ( KO ) mice ( Figure 1C , lane 3 ) ( Bakker et al . , 1994 ) . RNase A treatment did not destroy the CYFIP1 - FMRP - eIF4E in - teraction as assessed by CYFIP1 antibody coprecipitation ( Figure 1D , comparelanes 2and6 , andFigure S2 ) , although ade - crease in the FMRP - CYFIP1 association did occur ( see below ) . These data indicate that the FMRP - CYFIP1 - eIF4E complex is maintained primarily by protein - protein interactions . To investigate whether the binding of the CYFIP1 - FMRP com - plex to m 7 GTP was mediated by FMRP , we performed m 7 GTP chromatography with FMR1 KO brain extracts ( Figure 1E ) . The eIF4E - CYFIP1 association did not require FMRP ( Figure 1E , lane 3 ) . Furthermore , addition of exogenous human 4E - BP1 ( Haghighat et al . , 1995 ) to brain extracts decreased the amount of FMRP - CYFIP1 bound to eIF4E ( Figure 1F , lanes 2 – 4 ) , sug - gesting that they competed for the same site on eIF4E . This was conﬁrmed with a 4E - BP mutated in the eIF4E - binding site ( Figure S3 ) . We conclude from these data that the FMRP - CYFIP1 complex binds eIF4E . Translational repression occurs when 4E - BPs bind eIF4E to the exclusion of eIF4G ( Marcotrigiano et al . , 1999 ; Richter and Sonenberg , 2005 ) . Consequently , we investigated whether the absence of a functional eIF4GI impaired the binding of CYFIP1 - FMRP complex to eIF4E . After inactivation of eIF4GI by cleavage ( Gradi et al . , 1998 ) ( Figure 1G , lane 1 , asterisk ) , CYFIP1 and FMRP still bound eIF4E ( Figure 1G , lane 2 ) , indicating that binding of CYFIP1 to eIF4E does not require functional eIF4G . PABP at the 3 0 terminus of mRNA interacts with the 5 0 cap - binding complex and circularizes mRNAs ( Mazumder et al . , 2003 ) . Furthermore , the noncoding RNA BC1 , which resides in the FMRP complex ( Zalfa et al . , 2003 , 2005 ; Gabus et al . , 2004 ; Johnson et al . , 2006 ; Centonze et al . , 2007b ) also binds PABP ( West et al . , 2002 ) . To test whether the FMRP - CYFIP1 complex simultaneously interacts with PABP , we used poly ( A ) - Sepharose beads to isolate PABP and associated factors from brain extracts . The FMRP - CYFIP1 complex was recovered to - gether with PABP ( Figure S4A ) . The binding of CYFIP1 to PABP was independent of FMRP and BC1 RNA , as shown by the use of FMR1 and BC1 KO ( Skryabin et al . , 2003 ) brain ex - tracts ( Figure S4A ) . Moreover , the recovery of the FMRP - CYFIP1 complex was not due to nonspeciﬁc binding of CYFIP1 or FMRP to the polyribonucleotides afﬁxed to the beads ( Figure S4B ) . PABP and FMRP were also coimmunoprecipitated ( Figure 1C , lane 4 ) , indicating that FMRP and CYFIP1 are present in a com - plex containing both eIF4E and PABP . CYFIP1 Binds Directly and Speciﬁcally to eIF4E Because CYFIP1 bound m 7 GTP ( Figure 1B ) independently of FMRP ( Figure 1E ) , wehypothesized thatCYFIP1 mightbeanovel Cell 134 , 1042 – 1054 , September 19 , 2008 ª 2008 Elsevier Inc . 1043 eIF4E - binding protein . eIF4G and several characterized 4E - BPs share a short consensus motif that is responsible for binding to eIF4E ( Richter and Sonenberg , 2005 ) . Therefore , we used multi - sequence alignments to search for a similar peptide that is con - served in the CYFIP protein family . A candidate peptide ( residues 733 to 751 , human CYFIP1 , Swissprot annotation Q14467 ) was identiﬁed in the central region of CYFIP1 . Here , several amino acids are conserved among CYFIP and human 4E - BPs , 4G - I , and 4G - III ( Figure 2A ) . To validate the functional signiﬁcance of this similarity , we compared a structural arrangement of the CYFIP1 peptide spanning residues 733 to 751 with the known structure of eIF4E when complexed with the 4E - BP1 peptide ( Tomoo et al . , 2005 ) . Indeed , the CYFIP1 peptide ( blue ribbon in Figure 2B ) could potentially adopt the peculiar ‘‘reverse L shaped’’ structure with two a - helical turns located at its center that are stabilized by two internal salt bridges between residues Asp742 - Arg744 and Glu748 - Lys750 . Moreover , the CYFIP1 peptide docks onto the molecular binding surface of eIF4E ( red Figure 1 .

In particular , the internal salt bridge Asp742 - Arg744 ( Figure 2B and Figure S6A ) restricts the available conformations of the basic residue Lys743 and is thus locked in a favorable position for the formation of a salt bridge with Glu132 of eIF4E ( Figure 2B ) . The 4E - BP1 peptide ( purple ribbon , Figure 2C ) and the CYFIP1 binding peptide ( blue ribbon , Figure 2C ) overlap in their ‘‘reverse L shaped’’ pre - dicted structure and ﬁt into the eIF4E pocket . The m 7 GTP - Sepharose chromatography ( Figure 1 ) and the in silico analysis ( Figure 2 ) predict that residues 733 to 751 of CYFIP1 may fold into an eIF4E - binding domain even though the amino acid se - quence does not conform to the previously established consen - sus YxxxxLL ( Mader et al . , 1995 ; Altmann et al . , 1997 ) . The charged residues implicated in the interaction are important for establishing the recognition between CYFIP1 and eIF4E . Inter - estingly , this pattern is common among three different protein families ( CYFIP , 4G , 4E - BPs ) that interact with eIF4E ( Figure 2A ) . To determine whether CYFIP1 is a 4E - BP , we performed GST - Sepharose pull - down assays using in vitro - synthesized 35 S - methionin - labeled proteins . Like 4E - T ( Ferraiuolo et al . , 2005 ) ( Figure 3A , lane 7 ) , CYFIP1 was precipitated speciﬁcally by GST - eIF4E ( Figure 3A , compare lane 4 with lanes 2 and 3 ) , indi - cating that eIF4E directly interacts with CYFIP1 . The binding of CYFIP1 to the GST - eIF4E W73A mutant was reduced by 70 % , similar to the effect on 4E - T ( Figure 3B ) . eIF4E simultaneously interacts with CYFIP1 and m 7 GTP , because both proteins were retained on m 7 GTP - Sepharose beads . The retention of CYFIP1 was insensitive to RNase and DNase ( Figure S5 ) . To verify the importance of the putative eIF4E - binding region for the eIF4E - CYFIP1 interaction , we introduced several mutations in the CYFIP1 sequence ( Figure 3C ) , followed by chromatography on m 7 GTP - Sepharose ( Figure 3D ) . First , the Asp742 and Arg744 residues were both mutated to alanine , thus removing the salt bridge at the beginning of the a helix and presumably allowing more ﬂexibility of the critical Lys743 . This mutant ( A - A ) bound 20 % less efﬁciently than did the wild - type . We introduced other mutations that affect both internal salt bridges ( Asp742Lys ; Arg744Glu ; Glu748Lys ) and invert the electric charge of the crit - ical lysine that is predicted to interact with eIF4E ( Lys743Glu ) . Binding of this quadruple mutant ( KEE - K ) was reduced even fur - ther ( by 60 % ) , indicating that this region of CYFIP1 is involved in eIF4E binding . Finally , we studied the importance of the lysine that presumably interacts with eIF4E , mutating it to glutamate ( - E - ) . This single substitution had an effect similar to that of the quadruple mutation ; a reduction of 70 % ( compare the last two bars in Figure 3D , right panel ) . Because the substitution of Lys743 with a residue of opposite charge did not induce desta - bilization of the ‘‘reverse L shaped’’ structure of the CYFIP1 pep - tide , the strong inhibition of eIF4E binding indicates that Lys743 is involved in the interaction of CYFIP1 with eIF4E , as predicted by sequence and structural analysis ( Figure S6 ) . On the contrary , the two salt bridges , Asp742 - Arg744 and Glu748 - Lys750 ( Fig - ure 2A ) , stabilize the CYFIP1 peptide in a conformation that is able to interact with the eIF4E protein surface through Lys743 . Mutagenesis of CYFIP1 where a 4E - BP motif similar to the YxxxxLL consensus was found ( WFREFFL ) ( Figure S7 ) did not signiﬁcantly change the binding to eIF4E . To assess whether the isolated CYFIP1 peptide , which in - cludes the eIF4E - binding domain , binds puriﬁed eIF4E , we syn - thesized wild - type ( WT ) and two mutant peptides ( K - EE - K and - E - , Figure 3C ) afﬁxed to biotin . The western blot in Figure 3E shows that under stringent conditions ( 300 mM NaCl ) , no eIF4E bound to either the control ( lane 2 ) or the CYFIP1 mutant peptides ( lanes 4 and 5 ) , whereas the streptavidin beads con - taining the WT peptide efﬁciently bound puriﬁed human eIF4E ( lane 3 ) . In less stringent conditions ( 150 mM NaCl , lower panel ) the mutant peptides also bound some eIF4E but with lower efﬁ - ciency than did the WT peptide . Therefore , the region of CYFIP1 with structural homology to the 4E - BPs does indeed bind eIF4E . CYFIP1 speciﬁcally and directly interacts with eIF4E through the noncanonical motif DKRLRSECK , where the lysine at the second position is critical for the interaction . The FMRP - CYFIP1 Complex Is Consolidated by Binding to RNAs To address the role of CYFIP1 in vivo , we transfected mamma - lian cells with DNA encoding this protein ; as expected , overex - pression of CYFIP1 repressed general translation . Silencing of CYFIP1 increased general translation ( Figure S8B ) . Targeting Figure2 .

According to our model , FMRP recruits CYFIP1 to mRNAs . To test this model , we used 35 S - labeled FMRP and CYFIP1 proteins and the FMRP target mRNA encoding Arc / Arg3 . 1 . GST - eIF4E pull - down experiments showed that eIF4E did not bind signiﬁ - cantly to FMRP ( Figure 4A , compare lane 3 with lane 7 ) , whereas it binds to CYFIP1 , as shown before ( compare lane 4 to lane 8 ) . When capped - Arc mRNA was added , CYFIP1 and especially FMRP interacted more efﬁciently with eIF4E ( Figure 4A , lane 6 ) . The speciﬁcity was conﬁrmed by the reduced recovery of the FMRP - CYFIP1 complex in presence of a nonneuronal mRNA ( capped - luciferase mRNA ) , as shown in Figure 4A ( lane 10 ) . Some residual FMRP and CYFIP1 bound also to luciferase mRNA , in agreement with the fact that CYFIP1 also inhibits lucif - erase mRNA ( by 25 % ; Figure S8 ) . Thus , the interaction between FMRP / CYFIP1 and eIF4E is increased and possibly stabilized by the presence of target mRNAs , consistent with the decreased coprecipitation of FMRP with CYFIP1 after RNase treatment ( Figure 1D ) . Blocking of BC1 RNA in vitro reduces the afﬁnity of FMRP to at least some of its target mRNAs ( Zalfa et al . , 2003 ) . We therefore tested whether the absence of BC1 RNA interferes with the bind - ing of FMRP - CYFIP1 to eIF4E . When m 7 GTP - Sepharose and brain extracts from BC1 KO mice were used , there was a signif - icant decrease ( by 60 % ) in the amount of recovered FMRP ( Figure 4B , lane 7 ) . This effect is consistent with the decreased coprecipitation of FMRP with CYFIP1 after RNase treatment ( Figure 1D ) . Furthermore , CYFIP1 formed an RNP containing BC1 RNA ( Figure 4B and Figure S9 ) , and in the absence of FMRP , the association of BC1 RNA with CYFIP1 decreased ( Figure 4C ) , indicating that FMRP and BC1 require each other for optimal interaction with CYFIP1 and eIF4E . We then assessed whether CYFIP1 is associated with mRNAs in the brain . Figure 4D ( lanes 2 and 3 ) shows that Map1b mRNA ( Bagni and Greenough , 2005 ) was detected in the CYFIP1 immu - noprecipitate . One negative control was neuronal D 2 DR mRNA , whose metabolism is not affected by FMRP ( Centonze et al . , 2007a ) . Other FMRP target mRNAs were also investigated . The association of Map1b , a CaMKII , and Arc ( Zalfa et al . , 2003 ) , but possibly not of App ( Westmark and Malter , 2007 ) , with the CYFIP1 complex was decreased in the absence of BC1 RNA ( Figure 4D , Figure S9 ) . RT - Q - PCR was also performed for Map1b mRNA ( Figure 4E ) , conﬁrming and extending our previous data Figure 3 . eIF4E and CYFIP1 Interact Directly ( A ) GSTpull - downassays .

Another putative FMRP target is Fmr1 mRNA ( Schaeffer et al . , 2001 ; Miyashiro et al . , 2003 ) , which we did not detect in the neuronal CYFIP1 complex ( Figure S9 ) . Taken together , these data show that CYFIP1 requires BC1 RNA and FMRP for optimal association with—and translational repression of—some key brain mRNAs . The FMRP - CYFIP1 Complex Is Activity - Regulated in Neurons Next , we analyzed the distribution of FMRP - CYFIP1 , FMRP - eIF4E , and CYFIP1 - eIF4E in primary cultures of hippocampal neurons . eIF4E was colocalized with CYFIP1 and FMRP in cell bodies and dendrites ( Figure S10 ; see Figure S11 for speciﬁcity of antibody reaction ) . In some cases , synaptic activity and / or de - velopmental transitions can alleviate translational repression ( Gebauer and Hentze , 2004 ; Richter and Sonenberg , 2005 ) ; con - sequently , we investigated whether BDNF stimulation caused re - lease of eIF4E from the FMRP - CYFIP1 complex . Resting neuro - nal cultures are shown in Figure 5A , subpanels A – D . BDNF was added to hippocampal neurons for 30 min , 1 hr , or 4 hr , followed by eIF4E and CYFIP1 immunodetection ( Figure 5A , subpanels E – P ) . The overlap of CYFIP1 and eIF4E signals changed signiﬁ - cantly with BDNF treatment ; it decreased by 30 % after 1 hr of treatment . Over 4 hr , however , the difference from baseline was not signiﬁcant ( Figure 5A , subpanels M – P ) . To verify that the diminished colocalization corresponded to a decrease in the CYFIP1 - eIF4E complex , we performed CYFIP1 immunopre - cipitations with similarly treated neurons ( Figure 5B ) . As ex - pected , the yield of coprecipitating eIF4E , normalized for the amount of precipitated CYFIP1 , was reduced ( by 40 % ) after 30 min of BDNF treatment , although FMRP levels did not change ( Figure 5B ) . These data suggest that diminished colocalization reﬂects a decrease in complex formation . Moreover , eIF4G did Figure 5 .

These observations indicate that the inhib - itory FMRP - CYFIP1 - eIF4E complex is dynamically regulated in an activity - dependent manner to repress and then possibly re - lease dendritic mRNAs for translation . The FMRP - CYFIP1 - eIF4E Complex Is Present and Active at Synapses To address the functional signiﬁcance of the FMRP - CYFIP1 - eIF4E complex at synapses , we prepared synaptoneurosomes ( Pilo Boyl et al . , 2007 ) , the enrichment of which was monitored by PSD - 95 levels in the synaptic fraction compared to total ex - tracts ( Figure S12 ) . m 7 GTP - Sepharose beads were then in - cubated with extracts from cortical synaptoneurosomes . Figure 6A shows that CYFIP1 bound to the beads was speciﬁ - cally eluted with m 7 GTP , and FMRP was also detected in this complex ( Figure 6A , lane 3 ) . We then stimulated cortical synaptoneurosomes with BDNF , immunoprecipitated CYFIP1 , and examined coprecipitated eIF4E or associated mRNAs . In control experiments , eIF4E was associated with CYFIP1 ( Figure 6B , lane 2 ) . After 30 min of BDNF stimulation , a fraction of the eIF4E was released from the CYFIP1 complex ( Figure 6B , lane 5 and right panel ) . The disassembly of the CYFIP1 - eIF4E complex suggests that target mRNA translation was activated ; indeed , around 80 % of Map1b and BC1 RNAs , as measured by RT - Q - PCR , was released from the CYFIP1 complex after stimulation ( Figure 6C ) . Because FMRP responds to mGluR stimulation ( Weiler et al . , 1997 ; Huber et al . , 2002 ; Dolen et al . , 2007 ) , we treated hippo - campal and cortical synaptoneurosomes with the group I mGluR agonist DHPG . After 5 min of stimulation , a signiﬁcant decrease of eIF4E in the CYFIP1 complex was observed ( Figure 6D ) . Lon - ger stimulations ( DHPG for 15 min ) caused a signiﬁcant increase in CYFIP1 - eIF4E complex formation ( Figure S13 ) , suggesting that mGluR stimulation induced an initial release of CYFIP1 - eIF4E - regulated translation followed by rapid overcompensation . We also electroporated primary cortical neurons with siRNAs di - rected against CYFIP1 ; reduction of CYFIP1 protein lead to an in - crease of MAP1B ( Figure S14 ) . Finally , extracts from CYFIP1 het - erozygote mice ( CYFIP1 + / (cid:2) ) were analyzed ; in this case , MAP1B protein increased by (cid:3) 25 % compared to the WT . Furthermore , the translation of a CaMKII and APP proteins was also upregu - lated by (cid:3) 70 % and (cid:3) 90 % , respectively ( Figure 6E , compare lanes 1 and 2 ) . Taken together , these data show that CYFIP1 reg - ulates the expression of Map1b and other FMRP target mRNAs . DISCUSSION Although CYFIP1 was identiﬁed as an FMRP - interacting factor as well as a component of the WAVE complex involved in actin polymerization , its molecular function was unknown ( Schenck et al . , 2001 ; Kunda et al . , 2003 ) . We show that CYFIP1 binds eIF4E in brain extracts , synaptoneurosomes ( Figures 1 and 6 ) , and in vitro ( Figure 3A ) . CYFIP1 contains a peptide that is pre - dicted to exhibit structural similarity to the canonical eIF4E - bind - ing domain ( Richter and Sonenberg , 2005 ) ( Figure 2A ) . Indeed , the integrity of this sequence motif is required for efﬁcient eIF4E binding ( Figures 3C – 3E ) . CYFIP1 is not the ﬁrst eIF4E - binding protein that does not contain a well - conserved eIF4E - binding peptide ; the Xenopus oocyte maturation factor Maskin ( Richter and Sonenberg , 2005 ) is another example . It seems therefore likely that by convergent evolution , several protein families developed a surface domain that can efﬁciently block access of eIF4G to eIF4E . FMRP Recruitment of CYFIP1 Represses Translation The 4E - BPs bind eIF4E independently of other factors and thus downregulate the translation of many mRNAs that have no obvi - ous sequence similarity ( Richter and Sonenberg , 2005 ) . In other cases , eIF4E - binding proteins are recruited by speciﬁc proteins present only on a subset of mRNAs . For example , Maskin re - quires the RNA binding protein CPEB ( Richter and Sonenberg , 2005 ) , and Cup requires Bruno ( Nakamura et al . , 2004 ) or other proteins ( Nelson et al . , 2004 ) , depending on the developmental stage . Here , we show that CYFIP1 inhibits the translation of as - sociated mRNAs through FMRP ( Figure 4 ) . We propose that in the brain , FMRP helps recruit and / or stabilize CYFIP1 on the 5 0 end of speciﬁc mRNAs to repress translation . Several observa - tions support this point : the two proteins form a heterodimer ( Schenck et al . , 2001 ) ; FMRP increases the afﬁnity of CYFIP1 for capped mRNAs ( Figure 4A ) ; BC1 , an RNA involved in FMRP - mRNA complex formation ( Zalfa et al . , 2003 , 2005 ; Ga - bus et al . , 2004 ) , also increases the FMRP - CYFIP1 - eIF4E inter - action ( Figure 4B ) ; CYFIP1 is associated with BC1 RNA , Map1b , a CaMKII , Arc , and App mRNAs in the brain ; in FMR1 or BC1 KO mice , the interaction of these mRNAs with CYFIP1 is decreased ( Figures 4C – 4E , Figure S9 , and data not shown ) . Finally , reduc - tion of CYFIP1 in the brain leads to an increase of MAP1B , APP , and a CaMKII ( Figure 6E ) . These increases are consistent with those observed in the absence of FMRP in the mammalian brain ( Zhang et al . , 2001 ; Zalfa et al . , 2003 ; Lu et al . , 2004 ; Hou et al . , 2006 ; Westmark and Malter , 2007 ) . Fmr1 mRNA , an FMRP tar - get ( Schaeffer et al . , 2001 ; Miyashiro et al . , 2003 ) , is not part of the CYFIP1 mRNP , and consequently FMRP expression does not change upon CYFIP1 reduction ( Figure 6E and Figures S9 and S14 ) . Perhaps Fmr1 mRNA is regulated by a different FMRP complex or is not controlled at the translational level . The FMRP - CYFIP1 - eIF4E Complex Responds to Synaptic Stimulation One major issue concerning translation in neurons is regulation by synaptic stimulation . Protein synthesis is activated by several synaptic stimuli such as BDNF and DHPG . BDNF stimulates translation via mTOR and ERK - MAPK at synapses and likely in - volves modulation of initiation . Moreover , BDNF activates the translation of Arc and a CaMKII mRNAs in dendrites and at syn - apses ( Aakalu et al . , 2001 ; Yin et al . , 2002 ; Schratt et al . , 2004 ) . After application of BDNF to cultured primary neurons and synaptoneurosomes , we observed a dissociation of eIF4E and CYFIP1 , which coincided with the release of associated ( m ) RNAs ( Figures 5 , 6B , and 6C ) . In our model ( Figure 7 ) , this dis - assembly would free eIF4E to initiate translation . DHPG stimulation of mGluR activity also induces translation initiationviaERKandsubsequenteIF4Ephosphorylation ( Richter and Klann , 2007 ) . DHPG stimulation of synaptoneurosomes Cell 134 , 1042 – 1054 , September 19 , 2008 ª 2008 Elsevier Inc . 1049 caused CYFIP1 - eIF4E dissociation ( Figure 6D ) , conﬁrming a re - sponse of FMRP translational repression to mGluR signaling ( Huber et al . , 2002 ; Hou et al . , 2006 ; Dolen et al . , 2007 ) . Interest - ingly , we detected the release of CYFIP1 from eIF4E only after a short stimulation ( Figure 6D ) , which could be due to a short pulse of FMRP dephosphorylation observed under similar Figure 6 . The FMRP - CYFIP1 - eIF4E Complex Is Activity Regulated at Synapses ( A ) CYFIP1 - eIF4E complex is detected in synaptoneurosomes . m 7 GTP - Sepharose beads were incubated with synaptic extracts ; the recovered proteins were immunoblotted for CYFIP1 , FMRP , and eIF4E .

Alternatively , because Rac1 in its GTP form disassembles the FMRP - CYFIP1 complex in Dro - sophila ( Schenck et al . , 2003 ) , it is tempting to speculate that a similar mechanism could also mediate eIF4E dissociation from CYFIP1 . Relevance for the Fragile X Syndrome We propose that in the absence of FMRP , which causes FXS , there would be decreased binding of CYFIP1 to FMRP target mRNAs . This would relieve translational suppression and induce higher than normal levels of proteins whose synthesis is under the control of FMRP . On the other hand , the fact that CYFIP1 as - sociates with the WAVE complex , which plays a role in actin po - lymerization ( Bogdan et al . , 2004 ) , implicates the FMRP regula - tory complex in synapse maturation . In support of this notion , synaptic abnormalities observed in mutants affecting Rac1 sig - naling pathways resemble those in the FXS ( Tashiro and Yuste , 2004 ) . Furthermore , the role of CYFIP1 as coregulator of FMRP may also help to explain the autistic features of FXS because CYFIP1 has been recently implicated in autism ( Nishimura et al . , 2007 ; Nowicki et al . , 2007 ) . Further work is needed to un - derstand the functional consequences of impaired local protein synthesis in the developing brain and how this correlates to the autistic and FXS phenotypes . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Animals All animals were treated according to institutional and international guidelines ( see the Supplemental Data ) . The C57 / BL6 FMR1 KO mice were provided by Ben Oostra ( Bakker et al . , 1994 ) , the 129Sv BC1 KO mice by Juergen Brosius ( Skryabin et al . , 2003 ) , and the CYFIP1 + / (cid:2) mice by Walter Witke ( M . M . and W . W . , unpublished data ) . All of the animals used in this study were 3 weeks old . GST Pull - Down Assay Plasmids encoding GST , GST - DCOH , GST - eIF4E , and GST - eIF4E Trp73Ala ( seetheSupplementalData ) were expressed in E . coli BL21 ; lysateswere clar - iﬁed and mixed with glutathione - Sepharose 4B beads ( Amersham - Biosci - ences ) for 1 hr at 4 (cid:4) C . The beads were collected and washed in PBS 1 3 . Glutathione beads containing the same amount of fusion proteins ( 5 – 10 m g ) were incubated in binding buffer ( 20 mM Tris - HCl [ pH 8 . 0 ] , 100 or 200 mM NaCl , 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid [ EDTA ] , and 0 . 5 % NP - 40 ) . Pro - teins bound to the beads were resolved by SDS - PAGE . The same amounts of protein were subsequently incubated in 250 m l of binding buffer in the pres - ence of 5 m l of lysate containing in vitro - synthesized protein ( TNT System Promega ) . After 90 min incubation at 4 (cid:4) C , the beads were washed in binding buffer and resolved by SDS - PAGE and phosphorimaged . Protein Extract Preparation Total mouse brain and cultured primary neurons were homogenized in lysis buffer ( 100 mM NaCl , 10 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM Tris - HCl [ pH 7 . 5 ] , 1 mM dithio - threitol , 30 U / ml RNasin , 1 % Triton X - 100 , 0 . 5 mM Na - orthovanadate , 10 mM b - glycerophosphate , and 10 m g / ml Sigma protease inhibitor ) , incu - bated 5 min on ice , and centrifuged at 12 , 000 g for 8 min at 4 (cid:4) C , and the supernatant was used for immunoprecipitations and m 7 GTP - Sepharose chro - matography . For total protein analysis , brains were homogenized in Laemli buffer , boiled , and vortexed . The procedures were repeated ﬁve times . Immunoprecipitation Brain ( 500 – 800 m g ) or cell ( 200 m g ) extracts were used for immunoprecipitation experiments . For immunoprecipitation of FMRP , brains were prepared as de - scribed above , and a reversible immunoprecipitation system ( Catch and Re - lease v2 . 0 , Upstate ) was used . For CYFIP1 , the lysis buffer contained 150 mM NaCl , 50 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 8 . 0 ) , 1 . 5 % Triton X - 100 , and protease in - hibitors ( Sigma ) . The lysates were centrifuged ﬁrst at 1000 rpm and then at 10 , 000 rpm , each for 10 min at 4 (cid:4) C . The extracts were incubated with 4 m g of CYFIP1 polyclonal antibody ( see Table S1 for antibodies ) overnight at 4 (cid:4) C . Twenty microliters of protein A Sepharose ( Amersham ) previously satu - rated with 1 % BSA in PBS was incubated with the extract for 90 min at 4 (cid:4) C . The beads were washed three times in 1 ml of buffer ( 150 mM NaCl , 50 mM Tris - HCl [ pH 8 . 0 ] , and 1 % Triton X - 100 ) . The same amount of rabbit IgG was used as control . Immunoprecipitation experiments with CYFIP1 antibody followed BDNF ( 30 ng / ml ) stimulation of cortical neurons for 30 min before collecting the cells . Cosedimentation of Proteins on Polysome - mRNPs Gradients Total mouse brain was homogenized in lysis buffer ( see Protein Extract Preparation ) . The supernatants were centrifuged through 5 % – 25 % sucrose gradients as described in the Supplemental Data . Fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting . m 7 GTP Chromatography m 7 GTP - Sepharose beads ( Amersham Biosciences ) were equilibrated with buffer A ( 100 or 200 mM KCl , 50 mM Tris - HCl [ pH 7 . 5 ] , 5 – 10 mM MgCl 2 , and 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 ) plus BSA ( 0 . 1 mg / ml ) at 4 (cid:4) C for 30 min . The resin was washed and incubated with 500 – 900 m g of protein extract from mouse brain for 60 min at 4 (cid:4) C ; GTP ( 100 m M ) was added to reduce nonspeciﬁc binding . The beads were washed with 0 . 4 ml of buffer A and then incubated for 30 min with 200 m M of m 7 GTP . In some cases , 100 m g of RNase A ( Sigma ) and 1000 U of RNase T1 ( Roche ) per mg of protein were added ( Nakamura et al . , 2004 ) . Assay with Biotinylated Peptides Biotinylated CYFIP1 wild - type ( [ Btn ] AGSLLLDKRLRSECKNQ ) , mutant ( [ Btn ] AGSLLLKEELRSKCKNQ ; [ Btn ] AGSLLLDERLRSECKNQ ) , and control ( [ Btn ] GSAPTRPPPLPP ) peptides ( Sigma ) were dissolved in Tris - buffered sa - line ( TBS ) / Tween ( 0 . 02 % ) ; each peptide ( 25 m g ) was incubated with streptavi - din - conjugated magnetic beads ( 30 m l , Invitrogen ) for 15 min at room temper - ature in buffer ( 150 or 300 mM NaCl , 50 mM Tris - HCl [ pH 7 . 5 ] , and 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 ) . The beads were then washed twice in the same buffer and mixed with Figure 7 . Proposed Model for mRNA Translational Repression and Activation by the CYFIP1 - FMRP Complex The CYFIP1 - FMRP or CYFIP1 - FMRP - BC1 mRNA complex is transported in dendrites as translationally silent mRNPs . Some of these mRNPs are also present at synapses . After synaptic stimulation , and possibly after CYFIP1 and / or FMRP protein modiﬁcations , the CYFIP1 - FMRP complex is released from eIF4E , and local mRNA translation ensues .

Thebeads werethen washed , and the protein was eluted , immunoblotted , and probed for eIF4E . Immunoprecipitation Followed by RT - PCR and RT - Q - PCR Analysis For RT - PCR and RT - Q - PCR analysis of immunoprecipitates , the beads were saturated in 1 % BSA in PBS and heparin ( 1 mg / ml ) . CYFIP1 antibody was incubated with the beads ( 90 min at 4 (cid:4) C ) , washed three times ( 150 mM NaCl , 50 mM Tris - HCl [ pH 8 . 0 ] , and 1 % Triton X - 100 ) , and incubated with 300 m g of brain extract or 200 m g of synaptic brain extract plus heparin ( 0 . 1 mg / ml ) for 1 hr at 4 (cid:4) C . They were then washed , and RNA was eluted in 0 . 2 M NaAce - tate , 1 mM EDTA , and 0 . 2 % SDS for 5 min at 95 (cid:4) C . RNA was extracted ( Trizol , Invitrogen ) and used for p ( dN ) 6 - primed RT and PCR with mRNA - speciﬁc primers ( Table S2 ) . Real - time PCR was performed withan ABI7900Sequence Detector with dual - labeled TaqMan probes ( Applied Biosystems ) . See the Supplemental Data for further details . Neuronal Culture , Stimulation , and Image Analysis Primary mouse cortical neurons ( E15 ) were prepared as described ( Ferrari et al . , 2007 ) ; 14 DIV cells were treated with brain - derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) ( 30 ng / ml , Alomone Laboratory ) for 30 , 60 , or 240 min as described ( Takei et al . , 2001 ) . They were then ﬁxed with paraformaldehyde ( 1 % – 4 % ) , permeabilized with Triton X - 100 ( 0 . 2 % ) , and analyzed for CYFIP1 and eIF4E . See Table S1 for details of the antibodies . The images were acquired with a confocal laser scanning microscope ( LSM510 , Zeiss and BIORAD Radiance 2010 ) with plan neoﬂuar 40 3 or 63 3 oil objectives . Quantitative analysis in double - labeled material was performed blind from four different stimulated cultures by counting of 80 cells and 20 neurons ( for each condition ) . A total of 320 dendrites over a length of 50 m m starting 20 m m from the nucleus was analyzed . Quantiﬁcation was performed with ImageJ program ( 1 . 37v version ) ( from ImageJ for microscopy : http : / / www . macbiophotonics . ca / imagej / colour _ analysis . htm # coloc _ ica ) . SeetheSupplementalDataforfurtherdetails . Synaptoneurosomes Synaptoneurosomes were prepared by homogenization of fresh cortex tissue in ice - cold buffer as described ( Pilo Boyl et al . , 2007 ) . They were resuspended in HEPES - Krebs buffer ( 10 mM HEPES [ pH 7 . 4 ] , 150 mM NaCl , 3 mM KCl , 10 mM glucose , 2 mM MgSO 4 , and 2 mM CaCl 2 ) , equilibrated at 37 (cid:4) C for 5 min , and incubated at 37 (cid:4) C for 30 min with 200 ng / ml BDNF or for 5 min and 15 min with 100 m M DHPG . Stimulated and control ( buffer treated ) synap - toneurosomes were then lysed as previously described . Homology Modeling Methods A multialignment was carried out between a human 4E - BP1 fragment and twelve sequences of CYFIP 1 and 2 , chosen among different species and iso - forms ( data not shown ) . In this multialignment , only the CYFIP sequences with alengthcomparabletothatofhumanCYFIP1wereconsidered ( KIAA0068 , ac - cession number D38549 ) . A region showing a high conservation of residues that can be considered for the binding with eIF4E was found and modeled with the 4E - BP1 fragment present depicted by X - ray crystallography used as a template ( Tomoo et al . , 2005 ) . The sequence numbering of CYFIP1 resi - dues used throughout the analysis was made relative to the sequence of human CYFIP1 ( accession number Q14467 ) .
