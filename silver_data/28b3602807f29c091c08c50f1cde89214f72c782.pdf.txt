More than folding : localized functions of cytosolic chaperones Jason C . Young , Jose´ M . Barral and F . Ulrich Hartl Cellular Biochemistry , Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry , Am Klopferspitz 18a , D - 82152 Martinsried , Germany Compared with other chaperone systems , heat shock proteins Hsp70 and Hsp90 interact with a larger variety of co - chaperone proteins that regulate their activity or aid in the folding of speciﬁc substrate proteins . Although many co - chaperones are soluble cytosolic proteins , co - chaperone domains are also found in mod - ular adaptor proteins , which are often localized to intra - cellular membranes or elements of the cytoskeleton . These specialized co - chaperones include auxilin , cysteine string protein , Tom70 , UNC - 45 and homologs of Bag - 1 . The localized co - chaperones can harness the ATP - dependent mechanisms of Hsp70 and Hsp90 to do conformational work in diverse functional contexts , including vesicle secretion and recycling , protein trans - port and the regulated assembly and / or disassembly of protein complexes . Such ﬂexibility is unique to the cytosolic Hsp70 and Hsp90 chaperone system . It is generally accepted that molecular chaperones interact with folding intermediates of polypeptides , preventing non - productive interactions that would result in aggrega - tion , and aiding them in reaching their native state . The chaperones belonging to the heat shock protein Hsp70 , Hsp90 and chaperonin families act through cycles of substrate binding and release governed by ATP binding and hydrolysis [ 1 – 3 ] . In the eukaryotic cytosol , Hsp70 and Hsc70 ( 70 - kDa heat shock protein and cognate protein ) handle a broad range of substrate polypeptides , and contribute generally to the folding of newly synthesized proteins and refolding of proteins after stress denaturation [ 2 ] . Hsp90 ( 90 - kDa heat shock protein ) and the chaperonin CCT / TRiC are thought to mediate folding of a more limited set of substrates , including various signal - transducing proteins in the case of Hsp90 [ 2 , 3 ] . Because Hsp90 often functions together with Hsc70 , the two chaperones might be considered as parts of a larger multi - chaperone system . Cytosolic Hsc70 and Hsp90 are further distinguished by the large number of regulatory or accessory co - chaperone proteins that they interact with . Many of these co - chaperones have a modular architecture in which a chaperone - interacting domain is fused to other sequences supplying different activities . Interestingly , several of these co - chaperone modules are targeted within the cytosolic compartment to different membrane systems or to cytoskeletal elements . Such localized co - chaperones can then recruit cytosolic Hsc70 or Hsp90 for tasks involving the conformational modulation of speciﬁc target proteins at the respective intracellular sites . Recent work has revealed some of the mechanisms and cellular processes supported by the targeted co - chaperones and their cytosolic chaperone partners . This review will focus on the best characterized of these speciﬁc co - chaperones , acting in endocytosis and exocytosis , protein targeting , cytoskeletal function and signal transduction . Three classes of co - chaperone domains appear as protein modules : DnaJ homology or J domains , Bag - 1 homology or Bag domains , and so - called tetratricopeptide repeat ( TPR ) clamp domains . Representative structures of these domains are depicted in Figure 1 [ 4 – 6 ] . DnaJ homologs were the ﬁrst co - chaperone proteins to be recognized as a family , and contain a conserved His - Pro - Asp tripeptide motif that is essential for function [ 7 ] . The J domains of these homologs stimulate ATP hydrolysis via the partner Hsc70 proteins , converting them to the ADP - bound forms and leading to stable binding of substrates by the Hsc70 peptide - binding domains [ 1 , 2 ] . More recently , Bag - 1 homologs were also identiﬁed as a family of Hsc70 cofactors [ 8 ] . Bag domains interact with the ATPase Figure 1 . Molecular structures of modular co - chaperone domains .

TPR clamp domains were ﬁrst identiﬁed as homologous sequences in a series of cytosolic Hsp90 co - chaperones [ 10 ] , and are now known to recognize the C - terminal peptides of Hsp90 or Hsc70 , or both [ 3 , 6 ] . At least one TPR clamp protein , Hop / Sti1 , inhibits the ATPase cycle of Hsp90 , whereas other such co - chaperones do not [ 11 ] . Thus , the localized co - chaperones of Hsc70 and Hsp90 can control the biochemical regulation as well as the intracellular location of the recruited chaperones . An important comparison can be made to the action of organellar Hsp70s in polypeptide transport across mem - branes . The unique mitochondrial - inner - membrane co - chaperone Tim44 localizes mitochondrial matrix Hsp70 ( mtHsp70 / Ssc1 ) to drive import into mitochondria [ 12 ] , and Bip / Kar2 ( ER lumenal Hsp70 ) similarly requires the membrane - anchored J domain of Sec63 to act in ER translocation [ 13 ] . Analogously , cytosolic Hsc70 and / or Hsp90 can be recruited by their localized co - chaperones to accomplish speciﬁc tasks . Clathrin uncoating Perhaps the best - known specialized co - chaperone is the J - domain protein auxilin , which functions in the Hsc70 - mediated uncoating of clathrin - coated vesicles ( CCVs ) budded from the plasma membrane [ 14 ] . Neuronal auxilin contains a central clathrin - binding domain and a J domain at the extreme C terminus ( Figure 2 ) . In vitro studies have established that the clathrin - binding domain ﬁrst assem - bles onto clathrin cages , and the J domain then stimulates free Hsc70 to hydrolyze ATP . Hsc70 in the ADP state binds tightly to clathrin , presumably in a manner similar to the binding of an unfolded polypeptide , and this distorts the conformation of clathrin leading to disassembly of the cage [ 14 , 15 ] ( Figure 3 ) . In the cytosol , Hsc70 continuously Figure 2 . Schematic diagram of localized co - chaperone proteins .

The non - neuronal form of auxilin , called GAK ( cyclin G - associated kinase ) or auxilin 2 , contains an additional N - terminal kinase domain ( Figure 2 ) that is not required for clathrin uncoating but might regulate clathrin assembly [ 17 , 18 ] . Different experimental approaches have conﬁrmed the functions of Hsc70 and auxilin in clathrin uncoating in vivo : ( i ) by overexpressing dominant inhibitory mutants of Hsc70 in cultured HeLa cells ; ( ii ) by RNA interference knockdown of auxilin expression in Caenorhabditis elegans ; ( iii ) by injection of mutant auxilin lacking a functional J domain into squid presynaptic nerve term - inals ; and ( iii ) by a genetic screen in Drosophila for endocytosis mutants revealing a point mutation in Hsc70 [ 19 – 22 ] . In all cases , clathrin - dependent endocytosis is markedly inhibited and is accompanied by abnormal vesicular accumulation of clathrin . Disruption of Hsc70 function in HeLa cells causes defects not only in endocytosis , but also in vesicle transport between the trans - Golgi , endosomes and plasma membrane , suggesting that Hsc70 together with auxilin or GAK might be generally required for all clathrin - dependent vesicle trafﬁcking [ 19 ] . Consistent with this , RNA inter - ference of auxilin in C . elegans leads to broad develop - mental defects and an overall intracellular immobilization of clathrin [ 20 ] . However , a new report suggests that Hsc70 and auxilin also form complexes with dynamin , a GTPase that works in the budding and ﬁssion of CCVs , and some of the effects of disrupting auxilin in vivo might arise from defects in vesicle formation as well as in clathrin uncoating [ 23 ] . The Saccharomyces cerevisiae auxilin called Swa2 / Aux1 differs from the animal forms in several interesting aspects . Between the clathrin - binding and J domains , Swa2 also contains a predicted TPR clamp domain , which is expected to recognize Hsc70 and / or Hsp90 [ 24 , 25 ] ( Figure 2 ) . The swa2 – 1 mutation bears a single amino - acid exchange in a conserved residue of the TPR domain . Interestingly , the swa2 – 1 mutation shows synthetic lethality with a deletion of the gene encoding the ADP - ribosylation factor Arf1 ( hence the name Swa2 , synthetic lethal with arf1 ) , which functions in coated - vesicle transport between the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) and Golgi . Although deletion of the gene encoding Swa2 causes endocytosis defects , the swa2 – 1 point mutation does not interfere with clathrin binding or stimulation of the Hsc70 ATPase by the Swa2 J domain [ 24 ] . Thus , chaperone binding to the TPR domain might serve a function that is unique to yeast auxilin . One possibility is the involvement of Swa2 in the formation of the ER during cell division in yeast , which is a function not known for auxilin or GAK in animal cells [ 26 ] . Synaptic vesicle fusion Cysteine string protein ( CSP ) is a specialized J - domain co - chaperone and was ﬁrst shown to function in calcium - activated exocytosis of synaptic vesicles [ 27 , 28 ] . CSP has been identiﬁed in Drosophila , Torpedo and mammals ( with some species having different isoforms ) , but is not found in S . cerevisiae . CSP contains a J domain at its N terminus , and a central cysteine - rich sequence anchored to vesicle membranes by multiple acylations [ 29 ] ( Figure 2 ) . The involvement of Hsc70 in CSP - mediated exocytosis in vivo is now supported by a mutagenesis study in Drosophila , which produced several alleles of Hsc70 that caused impaired synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction . Importantly , these particular Hsc70 alleles did not cause endocytosis or vesicle recycling defects , suggesting that the phenotype is unrelated to the clathrin - uncoating activity of Hsc70 [ 30 ] . The exact mechanism of CSP activity is still unresolved . CSP interacts with some neuronal SNARE proteins [ 31 ] , which are responsible for vesicle targeting and fusion , and Hsc70 that is recruited by CSP has been proposed to stabilize unstructured monomeric SNAREs before for - mation of the fusion - active hetero - oligomeric SNARE complex [ 29 ] . However , there is also some evidence that CSP might regulate the activity of the calcium channels that trigger neurotransmitter release . These channels are controlled by the heterotrimeric GTP - binding proteins ( G proteins ) such that , after dissociation from the GTP - bound G a subunit , the free G bg subunits bind the channels and down - regulate their activity . CSP forms complexes with both G bg and G a , and calcium - channel modulation by CSP overexpression in cultured neuronal cells shows characteristics of G bg inhibition [ 32 ] ( Figure 4 ) . In some cases , CSP acts with another co - chaperone called SGT ( small glutamine - rich TPR protein ) . SGT has an Hsc70 - binding TPR clamp domain in its central region and a glutamine - rich sequence of unknown function near the C terminus ( Figure 2 ) . The N - terminal region of SGT binds the C terminus of CSP ( Figure 2 ) , localizing a fraction of the cytosolic SGT and Hsc70 to vesicle membranes in a trimeric complex . Together , CSP and SGT regulate the ATPase activity of Hsc70 , and SGT overexpression in neurons inhibits neuronal exocytosis [ 33 ] . Although it is not yet clear at which step of membrane fusion the SGT - containing complex works , the TPR domain of SGT might transiently anchor Hsc70 to the membrane to handle the relevant polypeptides . Among these polypeptides could be the small GTPases of the Rab protein family , particularly the neuronal Figure 3 . Clathrin uncoating by auxilin and Hsc70 . Auxilin targets via its clathrin - binding domain ( gray ) to clathrin ( dark purple ) on the surface of vesicles . The J domain of auxilin ( red ) triggers ATP hydrolysis by Hsc70 ( light purple ) , which then binds clathrin tightly . Hsc70 binding causes dissociation of clathrin from the vesicle surface , and enables it to recycle onto membranes .

GTP hydrolysis by Rab3A on vesicle membranes is triggered upon vesicle fusion , and the brain - speciﬁc GDP - dissociation inhibitor a ( a GDI ) then trans - fers Rab3A from the membrane to the cytosol . It seems that the a GDI binds Rab3A on the membrane in a complex containing CSP , Hsc70 and Hsp90 . Interestingly , both the removal of Rab3A from membranes and the subsequent dissociation of a GDI are blocked by the anti - tumor drugs geldanamycin and radicicol , which speciﬁcally inhibit the Hsp90 ATPase cycle . The binding of a GDI by Hsp90 , and probably also by Hsc70 , is therefore proposed to facilitate both the membrane extraction of Rab3A and its reassem - bly on the membrane in the GTP - bound state [ 34 ] ( Figure 4 ) . It will be interesting to see if a similar mechanism also applies to other Rab proteins , or even to other members of the GTPase superfamily that includes the heterotrimeric G proteins and Arf1 . Protein targeting Cytosolic Hsc70 is known to be important for the post - translational translocation of proteins across the ER , mitochondrial and peroxisomal membranes [ 35 – 37 ] . This Hsc70 function has been thought to be non - speciﬁc for the target organelles , most probably involving the prevention of precursor protein aggregation . However , genetic anal - ysis has shown that the S . cerevisiae co - chaperone Djp1 is speciﬁcally involved in targeting to peroxisomes , but not to the ER or mitochondria . Djp1 has a J domain at its N terminus , and C - terminal sequences that might interact with the peroxisomal surface ( Figure 2 ) , although only a fraction of the protein co - localizes with membranes [ 38 ] . The molecular mechanism of Djp1 function with Hsc70 could thus involve cycling with precursor proteins from the cytosol to the peroxisomal membrane . Recently , the mitochondrial import receptor Tom70 ( 70 - kDa translocase of the outer membrane ) has also been shown to act as a localized co - chaperone [ 39 ] . From yeast to mammals , Tom70 functions in the post - translational import of mitochondrial proteins having non - classical , internal targeting sequences [ 40 , 41 ] . An N - terminal domain anchors Tom70 to the cytoplasmic face of the mitochondrial outer membrane ( MOM ) , followed by a chaperone - binding TPR clamp domain and another domain that binds directly to preproteins ( Figure 2 ) . Mammalian Tom70 recognizes both Hsp90 and Hsc70 , but the yeast Tom70 is speciﬁc for Hsc70 ( the Ssa proteins ) . When chaperone binding to the Tom70 TPR domain is disrupted by competition with an Hsp90 fragment in vitro , or mutation of Tom70 in yeast , mitochondrial targeting is inhibited and the oligomeric preprotein - Tom70 complex that precedes transport across the MOM cannot assemble . Furthermore , mitochondrial import of Tom70 - dependent preproteins in mammals is blocked by the Hsp90 - speciﬁc inhibitor geldanamycin both in vitro and in Cos7 cultured cells [ 39 ] , suggesting that the chaperones might also help transfer preproteins from the Tom70 complex to the intermembrane space ( Figure 5 ) . The mammalian Tom34 protein , which has no counter - part in yeast , might also function in the targeting of mitochondrial proteins with classical N - terminal pre - sequences [ 42 ] . Tom34 contains a TPR clamp domain that recognizes Hsp90 [ 43 ] ( Figure 2 ) . However , Tom34 is almost entirely cytosolic with only a small fraction associated with the MOM [ 42 ] , and possibly acts with Hsp90 in handling preproteins before they reach the membrane . Figure 4 . Functions of cysteine string protein ( CSP ) in synaptic vesicle exocytosis . CSP is attached to membranes by its acylated cysteine residues ( dark green ) . CSP inter - acts through its J domain ( red ) with Hsc70 ( light purple ) , and with interacts with the G a ( large orange oval ) and G bg subunits ( small orange ovals ) of heterotrimeric G pro - teins to modulate calcium channel activation of exocytosis . CSP might also recruit Hsc70 to stabilize monomeric SNARE proteins ( dark purple ) before SNARE - complex formation , vesicle fusion and neurotransmitter release ( lime green ) . After vesicle fusion , CSP works with Hsp90 ( brown ) and Hsc70 to release the regulatory complex of Rab3a ( pink ) and a GDI ( pale green ) from the membrane and recycle Rab3a onto vesicles . Some functions of CSP involve the co - chaperone SGT , which binds to Hsc70 through its TPR clamp domain ( blue ) and to CSP through its N - terminal domain ( light gray rectangle ) .

Again , the recruited chaperones are thought to fulﬁll different functions at these macromolecular assemblies . In C . elegans , the unc - 45 gene product ( named for the uncoordinated phenotype ) is required for the correct assembly of conventional myosin into muscle thick ﬁlaments , which then contact the actin - based thin ﬁlaments of the sarcomere [ 44 , 45 ] . UNC - 45 contains an N - terminal TPR clamp domain and a C - terminal UCS ( UNC - 45 / Cro1 / She4 ) domain . The TPR clamp binds speciﬁcally to Hsp90 , whereas the C - terminal regions bind and exert chaperone activity on the myosin head ( Figure 2 ) . Hsp90 recruited by UNC - 45 probably aids in the folding and assembly of myosin complexes , and might also act in their disassembly [ 46 ] . Mice and humans each have two UNC - 45 isoforms with the same domain conﬁguration . The striated muscle ( SM ) type is expressed only in cardiac and skeletal muscles and its function might be restricted to the sarcomere , whereas a general cell ( GC ) type of UNC - 45 is expressed in multiple tissues and might have a role in myosin - based cytoskeletal functions [ 47 ] . Although fungal UCS domain proteins are also important for the assembly and function of non - muscle myosins [ 48 ] , they do not contain TPR clamp domains . Instead , they contain N - terminal sequences that might interact with additional proteins , which in turn might recruit molecular chaperones . Intriguingly , TPR - containing co - chaperones also inter - act with cytoplasmic dynein , a motor protein that moves along microtubules . These include the immunophilin FKBP52 ( 52 - kDa FK506 - binding protein ) and cyclophilin Cyp40 , both of which bind Hsp90 through their TPR clamp domains . The interaction with dynein is mediated by their central peptidylprolyl isomerase ( PPIase ) domains ( Figure 2 ) , but is independent of this enzymatic activity . These co - chaperones are thought to link Hsp90 - bound steroid hormone receptors to the microtubule cytoskeleton for nuclear import [ 49 , 50 ] . Recent work with S . cerevisiae , using heterologously expressed glucocorticoid receptor , suggests that this interaction might not be necessary for nuclear transport [ 51 ] , but dynein binding might still increase the transport efﬁciency in mammalian cells . The J domain co - chaperone Mrj ( mammalian relative of DnaJ ) has recently been found to connect Hsc70 with the intermediate ﬁlament cytoskeleton . Mrj contains an N - terminal Hsc70 - regulatory J domain , and its C - terminal domain speciﬁcally recognizes the keratin 18 component of keratin 8 and 18 ( K8 / 18 ) intermediate ﬁlaments ( Figure 2 ) . Notably , microinjection of antibodies against Mrj into HeLa cells disrupts the K8 / 18 ﬁlament network without affecting the actin or microtubule cytoskeletons . Thus , it has been proposed that Hsc70 that has been recruited by Mrj acts in the regulated assembly of the keratin ﬁlament cytoskeleton [ 52 ] . Bag domain co - chaperones The Bag - 1 - related family of proteins form another family of modular co - chaperones [ 4 ] . As nucleotide exchange factors for Hsc70 , they probably act by stimulating ATP cycling by Hsc70 rather than stabilizing its binding to polypeptides . At least two Bag domain proteins are associated with plasma membrane proteins ( Figure 2 ) : SODD ( silencer of death domains ) or Bag - 4 with the cytosolic region of TNFR1 ( tumor necrosis factor receptor type 1 ) , and CAIR - 1 ( calcium - inﬂux inhibitor response regulated ) or Bag - 3 with PLC g ( phospholipase C - g ) . In both cases , the Bag co - chaperones bind the inactive forms of these signal transducers , and are released after activation upon binding of cytokine ligand to TNFR1 , or phosphorylation of PLC g by EGF - R ( epidermal growth factor receptor ) [ 53 , 54 ] . The function of Hsc70 in these pathways is not yet clear , but could be related to conformational changes required for the switching mech - anisms . In S . cerevisiae , the Bag domain co - chaperone Snl1 ( suppressor of Nup116C lethality ) is localized to the cytosolic face of nuclear and ER membranes , and can Figure 5 .

The chaperones dock onto the TPR clamp domain ( blue ) of Tom70 on the mitochondrial outer membrane .

The physiological function of Snl1 under normal growth conditions , however , remains to be established . Concluding remarks The list of localized co - chaperones of Hsc70 and Hsp90 continues to grow , and knowledge of how they act will broaden our understanding of the functions of these chaperones . Important questions concern how the recruited Hsc70 or Hsp90 proteins work mechanistically , and how the chaperone - mediated steps are integrated with the functions of other components . A few principles can be derived from what is known about the chaperone - dependent mechanisms discussed above . First , the action of the chaperones must be regulated as well as localized within the cytosol . For example , there is no evidence that auxilin and Hsc70 remove clathrin from clathrin - coated pits in the plasma membrane , but only from vesicles after budding [ 14 , 15 ] . Such regulation probably requires interactions in addition to those between the chaperones and co - chaperones . In the case of auxilin , it could be speculated that the interaction with dynamin during the vesicle budding process , but not afterwards [ 23 ] , might be such a regulatory interaction . Another example might be the chaperone - dependent removal of Rab3a from synaptic vesicle membranes [ 34 ] because the complex with CSP , Hsp90 and Hsp70 recognizes GDP - bound Rab3a together with a GDI , but probably not GTP - bound Rab3a without a GDI . For other functions of CSP and Hsp70 , including the interaction with the heterotrimeric G proteins [ 32 ] , the regulatory steps remain to be discovered . Second , additional interactions centered on the co - chaperones will also provide further speciﬁcity to the chaperone functions . A clear example is the function of Tom70 : although Hsp90 and Hsc70 help to bring mito - chondrial preproteins to the import receptor , sorting of preproteins from other chaperone substrates must be performed by Tom70 itself or other components of the import machinery [ 39 ] . The PPIases FKBP52 and Cyp40 , which connect to dynein and to Hsp90 , might similarly contribute to the speciﬁcity of microtubule - based transport because the steroid hormone receptors , but not other Hsp90 - bound substrates , are targeted to the nucleus [ 49 , 50 ] . It is not known how the dynein - bound complex distinguishes between liganded receptors , which must be targeted , and unliganded receptors , which must remain cytosolic , and the co - chaperones might also act in this regulatory step . A crucial challenge will be to discover how the speciﬁcity and regulation of chaperone function are determined by the components of these co - chaperone complexes . Third , the chaperones must fulﬁll their localized functions through the same biochemical mechanisms that they use for protein folding . Hsc70 is known to recognize short hydrophobic polypeptide stretches in an extended conformation [ 1 , 2 ] , and cellular processes that require Hsc70 , such as clathrin uncoating , probably require the presentation of such chaperone - binding sites . However , as cytosolic clathrin remains largely folded [ 16 ] , binding by Hsc70 does not necessarily imply a gross loss of protein structure . The features recognized by Hsp90 have not yet been clearly deﬁned , but this chaperone appears to bind some of its substrates when they are in a compact state close to their native conformation [ 3 ] . This charac - teristic suggests , for instance , that Hsp90 that has been recruited to myosin by UNC - 45 [ 45 ] might act in the ﬁnal stages of myosin assembly into thick ﬁlaments . The key to understanding these processes will be to determine which polypeptides are handled by the chaperones and what conformational changes are involved . Fourth , localization of the chaperone partners by their specialized co - chaperones is most probably necessary to accomplish the speciﬁed task . The localized co - chaperones must provide a particular orientation , local concentration or regulatory step of the chaperones that is needed for their relevant functions . In the absence of a localized co - chaperone , binding of chaperones to a crucial site might be too infrequent , or mechanically ineffective without a coordinating anchor . The modular domain structure of the co - chaperones imparts a unique ﬂexibility to the Hsc70 and Hsp90 chaperone system that enables it to act not only in conventional protein folding , but also in adjusting protein conformational switches in a multitude of cellular processes .
