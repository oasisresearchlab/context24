REVIEW Acute phase responses of passerine birds : characterization and seasonal variation Noah T . Owen - Ashley Æ John C . Wingﬁeld Received : 31 December 2006 / Revised : 5 July 2007 / Accepted : 5 July 2007 / Published online : 31 July 2007 (cid:1) Dt . Ornithologen - Gesellschaft e . V . 2007 Abstract The acute phase response ( APR ) is the ﬁrst line of defense that many vertebrates employ during a patho - genic challenge . This response is composed of a suite of physiological , behavioral , hormonal , and metabolic chan - ges that include fever , iron sequestration , anorexia , adipsia , somnolence , and activation of the hypothalamo - pituitary - adrenal ( HPA ) axis and suppression of the hypothalamo - pituitary - gonadal ( HPG ) axis . Although well - studied in mammals and domesticated birds , the APR of passerines is virtually unexplored . Here , we characterize the APR in several species of Emberizidae and examine seasonal var - iation . Captive and free - living sparrows were treated with lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , an immunogenic agent that triggers the APR without actually causing infection . LPS treatment activates the HPA axis , suppresses the HPG axis , decreases activity and food and water intake , and induces short - term hypothermia in captives , as well as inhibiting territorial aggressive behavior and song in free - living males . The magnitude of the APR also varies seasonally in males , implicating a tradeoff between physiological pro - cesses within particular life - history stages , such as reproduction . The proximate mechanisms underlying this seasonal modulation may include hormonal suppression by the steroid testosterone and seasonal differences in energy stores , which are rapidly depleted to a minimum body mass threshold as a result of APR - induced sickness behavior . We conclude by comparing this variation in APR to sea - sonal variation of avian stress responses .

The systemic APR is typ - ically triggered by proinﬂammatory cytokines , such as IL - 1 , IL - 6 and TNF a , which orchestrate a neurophysiological cascade consisting of immunological recruitment and inﬂammation , but also behavioral , hormonal , and meta - bolic functions ( Hart 1988 ; Kent et al . 1992 ) . In addition , the APR involves the secretion of acute phase proteins ( APPs ) from the liver . These proteins either increase or decrease in the circulation after an infectious challenge and have a number of antimicrobial properties : opsoni - zation of bacteria , activation of complement , enhancement Communicated by F .

Although the APR has been studied extensively in domesticated birds , this review summarizes the research that has been conducted on non - domesticated avifauna to date . Although the ﬁeld of ecological immunology is rel - atively nascent , many empirical studies have attempted to quantify adaptive immune responses ( cell - mediated , humoral ) in avian species in order to investigate physio - logical life - history tradeoffs of reproduction , growth , and sexually - selected trait development in relation to the costs and beneﬁts of immune system development and use ( Sheldon and Verhulst 1996 ; Norris and Evans 2000 ; Martin et al . 2006 ) . Unfortunately , very few studies have concentrated upon the APR despite the essential role this defense plays in combating and mitigating infection , pre - venting ongoing tissue damage , and activating repair processes and coping mechanisms which eventually help restore homeostasis . One of the salient aspects of the APR is induction of a febrile response ( hyperthermia , or a rise in body tempera - ture ) , although information on fever in birds is fairly limited compared to mammals . Most avian studies have focused solely upon the febrile response in domesticated species such as chickens Gallus domesticus ( Johnson et al . 1993 ) , pigeons Columba spp . ( Nomoto 1996 ) , Pekin Ducks Anas domesticus ( Maloney and Gray 1998 ) and Japanese Quail Coturnix coturnix japonica ( Koutsos and Klasing 2001 ) . These studies have documented that birds develop fever after LPS exposure , but that the magnitude and duration is regulated by a number of factors , such as dose ( Maloney and Gray 1998 ) , age ( Jones et al . 1983 ; Fraﬁeld and Kaplanski 1998 ) , and route of administration ( periph - eral vs central injection ; Johnson et al . 1993 ) . This rise in temperature is dependent upon a number of factors and not necessarily obligatory , because smaller passerine birds will often exhibit an opposing hypothermic response ( Jones et al . 1983 ; Fraﬁeld and Kaplanski 1998 ; Owen - Ashley et al . 2006 ) . Less research has focused upon the activation and reg - ulation of sickness behaviors and how this behavioral syndrome is expressed in wild birds . Sickness behavior includes reduced activity , anorexia ( a reduction in food intake ) , adipsia ( a reduction in water intake ) , and somno - lence ( a state of drowsiness or sleepiness ) . Traditionally , sickness behaviors have been viewed as a deleterious by - product of disease with little adaptive value to the host ( Johnson 2002 ) . A seminal paper by Hart ( 1988 ) suggested that these behaviors are actually beneﬁcial and represent a motivational behavioral syndrome by redirecting energy away from activities that promote foraging , growth , and reproduction to facilitate recovery and enhance disease resistance . Although reduced energy intake may at ﬁrst seem paradoxical for survival , both anorexia and adipsia are interpreted as strategies to minimize energy spent searching for food and water ( Hart 1988 ) while reducing intake of micronutrients , such as iron and zinc , which are important for bacterial replication ( Klasing 1984 ; Lan - ghans 2000 ) . In support of this view , acute food deprivation in mice increases survival rate and recovery time during bacterial infection ( Listeria ) compared to subjects given food ad libitum ( Wing and Young 1980 ) , and infected mice that have been force - fed to normal intake levels representative of healthy mice suffer increased mortality ( Murray and Murray 1979 ) . As with fever , the behavioral manifestations of sickness are costly , and a reduction in food intake and body mass below a minimum threshold may result in clinical disease and cachexia ( progressive wastage of adipose and muscle tissues ) , leading to a reduced chance for recovery and , ultimately , decreased survivorship ( Plata - Salama´n 1996 ; Kyriazakis et al . 1998 ) . Besides behavioral changes , the APR also consists of predictable neuroendocrine alterations that are triggered at the level of the hypothalamus , such as activation of the hypothalamo – pituitary – adrenal ( HPA ) cascade ( Bateman et al . 1989 ) and suppression of the hypothalamo – pituitary – gonadal ( HPG ) , somatotrophic , and thyrotropic axes ( Bla - lock 1994 ; Besedovsky and del Ray 1996 ) . The release of plasma glucocorticoids initially stimulates immune responses ( Dhabhar 2002 ) but , as levels continue to rise , they serve as the primary negative feedback mechanism to regulate the APR by decreasing the transcription rates and production of cytokines ( Munck et al . 1984 ; Besedovsky and del Ray 1996 ) . A central hypothesis of ecological and comparative immunology is that immunological defenses are balanced against their energetic costs to activate and maintain at the expense of competing physiological processes ( Sheldon and Verhulst 1996 ; Norris and Evans 2000 ) and their relative performance in thwarting continuous challenges from a variety of pathogens and parasites . Importantly , direct measures of immune system costs are rarely quantiﬁed with precision , owing to the complexity , diffusiveness , and pervasiveness of the vertebrate immune system ( Klasing 2004 ) . High immune responsiveness may also lead to inﬂammatory diseases and other autoimmunological disor - ders ( Ra˚berg et al . 1998 ; Graham et al . 2005 ) . The APR is arguably the most energetically demanding of all immune system defenses ( Lochmiller and Deerenberg 2000 ; Klasing 2004 ) , although much of its costs are attributed to fever , anorexia , and alterations in nutrient use to different organs ( Klasing and Austic 1994a , b ; Klasing 2004 ) . Compared to adaptive leukocyte - mediated defenses , the APR is thought to have lower protective value and a higher cost / beneﬁt S584 J Ornithol ( 2007 ) 148 ( Suppl 2 ) : S583 – S591 123 ratio ( Klasing 2004 ) . Nonetheless , the APR is broadly effective at controlling infection ( Blatteis 2006 ) and may be favored in circumstances where rapid response to infection is required or when rapid development precludes invest - ment in adaptive immunity ( Leshchinksy and Klasing 2001 ; Klasing 2004 ) . APR activation may also lead to the dis - ruption of normal physiological cycles and processes , such as reproduction ( Owen - Ashley et al . 2006 ) and growth ( Klasing et al . 1987 ) . It remains to be seen , however , if molt and migration are actually suppressed or delayed in favor of an APR , and this deserves further study . It is hypothesized that , owing to these costs , the APR will be modulated according to seasonal energy demands and possibly repro - ductive strategy and life - span . For example , if seasonal energy reserves are low ( e . g . , poor body condition ) , it is anticipated that APRs would be diminished due to energy constraints . Another physiological cascade that varies on a seasonal level is the avian adrenocortical stress response ( Romero 2002 ) . Many parallels can be drawn between this response and the APR , and it is suggested here that the APR is a unique type of coping response to stress , although its activation and seasonal regulation are somewhat different from the classical stress response ( Wingﬁeld 2003 ) . Both external and internal ( e . g . , disease ) perturbations can acti - vate the HPA axis , but infectious challenge is not traditionally viewed as a ‘‘stressor’’ per se . The goals of this paper are to characterize the APR in several passerine species with respect to previous studies involving domesticated birds and mammals , to examine seasonal variation in APR and potential mechanisms underlying these changes , and to compare and contrast APR variation with avian stress response modulation . APR characterization in passerines The majority of studies examining APRs involve the treatment of subjects with proinﬂammatory cytokines or bacterial lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) to activate the APR , although a variety of immunogens ( substances capable of triggering an immune response ) have been used . LPS is a biologically - active endotoxic compound that is isolated from gram - negative bacterial cell walls ( Kent et al . 1992 ) . As shown in Table 1 , the dynamics of the APR in passe - rines are similar to those described in chickens and mammals , with one notable exception : smaller passerine birds tend to exhibit acute hypothermia after LPS treat - ment , as measured in male and female Gambel’s White - crowned Sparrows ( Zonotrichia leucophrys gambelii ) ( Owen - Ashley et al . 2006 ) , instead of an average rise in body temperature . Although there are several factors that could predispose small birds towards APR - induced hypothermia , the most obvious reason is the thermoregu - latory challenge that small animals face to elevate their body temperature above their normal thermoregulatory setpoint through metabolic functions . Because of a high surface area to volume ratio , heat loss occurs at much higher rates in small passerines than in larger birds . This phenomena is not unique and also occurs in newborn rats and young chickens ( > 3 weeks old ) because of their small body size and inability to thermoregulate ( Jones et al . 1983 ; Fraﬁeld and Kaplanski 1998 ) . It is unclear why hypothermia occurs in smaller birds as opposed to rodents of similar body size , which elicit fever even at sub - maxi - mal doses of LPS . One possibility is that small birds maintain a higher body temperature ( 41 (cid:2) C ) than mammals ( 36 – 37 (cid:2) C ) , and any prolonged rise in body temperature above 41 (cid:2) C may be metabolically unfeasible . Other factors contributing to LPS - induced hypothermia include route of pyrogen administration and ambient temperature relative to the thermoneutral zone of the animal . It is unclear if hypothermia is an adaptive component of the APR in small passerines . Stereotypical behavioral changes documented in passe - rines include anorexia , adipsia , body mass loss , decreased locomotion , and disruptions in social behavior and activity ( Table 1 ) , as well as activation of the HPA axis , which are consistent with captive mammal and chicken studies . Because there is a short - term reduction or cessation in food consumption , birds also have the propensity to lose body mass or reduce growth even though activity has drastically declined to offset energy imbalances ( Klasing et al . 1987 ; Benson et al . 1993 ; Owen - Ashley et al . 2006 ) . Recent ﬁeld studies in the Rufous Song Sparrow ( Melospiza melodia morphna ) and Gambel’s White - crowned Sparrow indicate that males treated with LPS may exhibit a reduction in territorial aggression and song and tend to seek shelter to presumably avoid predation while coping with an inﬂam - matory challenge ( Owen - Ashley et al . 2006 ; Owen - Ashley and Wingﬁeld 2006 ) . Parental care is also suppressed in female House Sparrows ( Passer domesticus ) after LPS treatment as measured by a reduction in chick feeding rates , with some females even abandoning their young ( Bonneaud et al . 2003 ) . These studies illustrate the importance of examining APRs in free - living subjects to pinpoint changes in behavior that are only partially expressed or absent in captive birds and mammals . Furthermore , the study of APRs in non - domesticated birds may also provide a mechanistic link to explain life - history tradeoffs between immune function and other costly activities . For example , experimental vaccination reduces reproductive success in several passerine species ( Ilmonen et al . 2000 ; Ra˚berg et al . 2000 ; Bonneaud et al . 2003 ) . Since an APR is activated even after challenging subjects with relatively benign antigens , such as sheep’s red blood cells and vaccines J Ornithol ( 2007 ) 148 ( Suppl 2 ) : S583 – S591 S585 123 ( Klasing et al . 1987 ; Klasing 2004 ) , and since APRs disrupt the HPG axis ( Owen - Ashley et al . 2006 ) , there is reason to suspect that such ﬁtness costs described in these studies may be partially attributed to APRs . Research examining cytokine gene expression and the measurement of soluble proinﬂammatory cytokines are noticeably lacking in passerines due to the absence of species - speciﬁc antibodies and genetic markers , even though much progress has occurred in cloning and char - acterizing these compounds in chickens ( Leshchinksy and Klasing 2003 ; Kaiser et al . 2004 ) ( Table 1 ) . Similar work in passerines could provide insight into the molecular and physiological underpinnings of APR variation both within and between species . Recently , several bioassays to mea - sure several acute phase proteins ( mannan - binding protein , lysozyme , haptoglobin ) in avian plasma are available for use in a variety of birds , and require only 10 l l of plasma ( Millet et al . 2007 ) . Additional studies in passerines are needed to investigate if APRs involve changes in iron and zinc plasma concentrations , growth hormone and thyroid levels , and slow - wave sleep ( see Table 1 ) , to more fully understand the dynamics of APRs in wild birds given the work conducted to date in domesticated birds and mammals .

( 2002 ) S586 J Ornithol ( 2007 ) 148 ( Suppl 2 ) : S583 – S591 123 Seasonal modulation of APR Although the APR is integral to overcoming the onset of an infection , substantial energy reserves are relied upon to activate and maintain this inﬂammatory response because food intake is substantially reduced ( Lochmiller and De - erenberg 2000 ; Klasing 2004 ) . Despite the beneﬁcial role fever plays in enhancing immunological performance , it is also energetically costly to activate and maintain ; a 1 (cid:2) C rise in body temperature increases metabolic rate by approximately 10 % ( Kluger 1979 ) . The single most expensive aspect of the APR is the altered function of the liver . During an infection , the APR triggers the accretion of APPs from the liver at the expense of secreting nutrients for normal bodily functions such as reproduction , growth , and self - maintenance ( Klasing 2004 ) . This energetic bot - tleneck may be partially offset by decreased activity , which conserves energy . However , the activation of sickness behavior exacts an ‘‘opportunity cost , ’’ which may translate into temporary suspension of important life - history cycles , such as breeding , molt , and migration , leading to a potential net loss in ﬁtness depending upon the virulence of the intruding pathogen and the recovery time of the host . Because these competing demands and energy budgets oscillate predictably over the annual cycle , it has been hypothesized that the APR will vary on a seasonal basis . Given this information , the following predictions can be derived : the APR will be suppressed or inactivated if ( 1 ) reductions in energy reserves from sickness responses approach a minimum body mass threshold which threatens recovery and survival ( the energy limitation hypothesis ) , and / or ( 2 ) the ﬁtness cost of foregoing certain life - history stages outweighs the beneﬁt of producing the APR ( the life - history tradeoff hypothesis ) . It should be noted that these two hypotheses are not mutually exclusive , but rather represent complimentary proximate and ultimate explana - tions for why APR modulation might exist . A third hypothesis , that APRs are shaped by seasonal variation in parasitism risk and abundance , is less attractive , given that innate immune response are less effective in recognizing and responding to unique and rare pathogen threats com - pared to speciﬁc , lymphocyte - mediated immunity ( Roitt et al . 1998 ) . There is strong evidence to support the notion that the magnitude of the APR varies on a seasonal basis . Short - day lengths ( non - breeding conditions ) reduce the duration of LPS - induced sickness behavior in both male Siberian Hamsters ( Phodophorus sungorus ) and White - crowned Sparrows compared to long - day subjects ( Bilbo et al . 2002 ; Owen - Ashley et al . 2006 ) , but this seasonal change was not observed in female sparrows . This attenuation is correlated with seasonal changes in body fat composition and energy allocation , as long - day males are heavier and have more body fat reserves , on average , than their short - day coun - terparts that they could afford to lose during an APR . This hypothesis is further supported by the fact that these measures of body condition in female sparrows did not change according to photoperiod treatment , which coin - cides with their sickness responses failing to vary seasonally ( Owen - Ashley et al . 2006 ) . These captive studies illustrate that modulation of the APR is tightly regulated by energy reserves at the time of infection . Thus , individuals in poor condition may either suppress the APR to defend a critical minimum body mass threshold to avoid cachexia and starvation , or simply fail to mount the response due to energy constraints . In free - living male Song Sparrows , there is also seasonal modulation of the APR , with breeding ( long - day ) males failing to elicit sickness behavior compared to non - breed - ing ( short - day ) males ( Owen - Ashley and Wingﬁeld 2006 ) . This ﬁnding directly opposes the seasonal pattern docu - mented in the captive studies above . Why is this the case ? There are several possibilities , which together lend support to both the energy limitation and life - history tradeoff hypotheses . First , the seasonal patterns of energy deposi - tion are quite different in free - living male Song Sparrows compared to captive White - crowned Sparrows . Male Song Sparrows in the winter ( non - breeding ) are heavier and have larger fat depots than breeding males . In fact , furcular and abdominal reserves are virtually exhausted by the time males are defending a breeding territory in April ( Owen - Ashley and Wingﬁeld 2006 ) . Thus , suppression of the APR is likely favored during this time because there are few reserves available that can be expended during the sickness response . Second , higher baseline corticosterone levels in breeding males compared to wintering subjects indicate that energy demands are likely higher during the spring due to territorial defense , gonadal development , and elevated testosterone levels ( Ketterson and Nolan Jr . 1999 ) . This increased energy mobilization and lower energy avail - ability in males likely competes with APR activation and leads to decreased sensitivity to LPS or an outright inability to respond . Third , high testosterone levels of breeding males may directly act to suppress the APR . Although non - detectable during the winter , plasma androgen levels rise in the spring to coincide with heightened male – male encounters that occur during the maintenance and defense of a breeding territory ( Wingﬁeld 1994 ) . Expression of sickness behavior during this time may be maladaptive if the resident male loses a territory and / or is cuckolded by another male . Testosterone implants reduces the expression of sickness behaviors in captive White - crowned Sparrows ( Owen - Ashley 2004 ) , which provides the immune – endo - crine mechanism for males to favor reproduction at the expense of immune defense and lends support to the life - history trade - off hypothesis . However , it should be noted J Ornithol ( 2007 ) 148 ( Suppl 2 ) : S583 – S591 S587 123 that testosterone treatment also increases baseline cortico - sterone levels ( Casto et al . 2001 ; Owen - Ashley et al . 2004 ) , making it difﬁcult to attribute this diminished response to either the immunosuppressive effects of testosterone , cor - ticosterone , or both ( Owen - Ashley et al . 2004 ) . Fourth , it is also possible that social cues , such as the presence of a fertile mate , could modulate a male’s response to infection , especially if paternity was threatened . Evidence from mammals supports the idea that sickness behavior repre - sents a ﬂexible , motivational state that can be altered according to social / sexual stimuli ( Aubert 1999 ; Konsman and Dantzer 2001 ) . In summary , APR modulation is likely an adaptive life - history strategy that balances competing physiological demands with the costs and beneﬁts of pro - ducing an inﬂammatory response to maximize ﬁtness returns in a seasonal environment . Comparisons with the avian stress response The APR is a special type of physiological response employed by many vertebrates to combat and recover from a pathogenic challenge , although it is one of four ‘‘emer - gency life history states’’ that has evolved to permit an individual to cope with unpredictable perturbations , such as storms , decreased food supply , or infection ( Wingﬁeld et al . 1998 ; Wingﬁeld 2003 ) . The other three include pro - active / reactive coping styles , ﬁght - or - ﬂight responses , and facultative behavioral and physiological responses , such as seeking refuge , mobilizing energy , etc . ( see Wingﬁeld 2003 ) . These responses involve either a rapid sympathetic response from the autonomic nervous system ( ﬁght - or - ﬂight ) , or activation of the HPA axis to stimulate secretion of glucocorticosteroids within minutes of responding to a labile perturbation factor ( Wingﬁeld et al . 1998 ) . These steroids have multiple effects which promote a rapid recovery from the perturbation and range from increased energy mobilization , temporary suppression of the repro - ductive axis , increased foraging behavior , promotion of escape behavior during the day , to increased restfulness at night ( Wingﬁeld et al . 1998 ) . It is also well - appreciated that chronically - elevated levels can have deleterious effects that are clearly maladaptive , such as muscle wasting , inhibition of the reproductive system , neuronal cell death , and suppression of growth ( Wingﬁeld et al . 1998 ; Sapolsky et al . 2000 ) . It should be noted , however , that during an APR , glucocorticoids can exert different effects than those described above . For instance , instead of an increase in activity and foraging behavior , glucocorticosteroids in combination with cytokines actually promote a reduction in feeding and drinking and decreased activity , as part of the general sickness behavior syndrome ( Dantzer et al . 1993 , 1998 ) . Glucocorticoids also initially stimulate immuno - logical functions ( Dhabhar 2002 ) , but eventually provide negative feedback to regulate cytokine release to prevent tissue damage from sepsis and potentially harmful auto - immune diseases ( Johnson et al . 1996 ) . Nevertheless , there are also some similarities and interactions between the two coping responses . Both the APR and avian response to handling stress are modulated on a seasonal basis ( Romero 2002 ) , and this modulation is thought to represent a bal - ance between individual risk / protection versus ﬁtness beneﬁts realized in the future . It is also common for the APR to overlap with other coping responses if the subject has been wounded ( Wingﬁeld 2003 ) . Furthermore , both the APR and avian stress response share some of the same neuroendocrine control mechanisms ( e . g . , the HPA axis ) , which may lead to similar patterns of variation across life - history stages ( Ricklefs and Wikelski 2002 ) . Conclusions The APR is well - studied in both mammals and domesti - cated birds , but less is known in non - domesticated avian species , such as Passeriformes . The majority of immuno - ecological studies to date have failed to measure APRs , despite the protective functions these responses play in controlling infection , activating tissue repair , and restoring homeostasis . Besides these purported beneﬁts , the APR also exacts energetic and life - history costs , which are hypothe - sized to inﬂuence its expression on a seasonal basis . We introduced two hypotheses to explain the factors that may mediate this seasonal modulation : ( 1 ) the energy limitation hypothesis , and ( 2 ) the life - history tradeoff hypothesis . Whether the APR varies according to phylogeny , repro - ductive strategy , and other life - history stages , such as molt and migration , requires further study . Expectation of future reproduction and the ‘‘pace - of - life’’ continuum may also be important life - history parameters in determining APR modulation ( Ricklefs and Wikelski 2002 ; Lee et al . 2005 ; Martin et al . 2006 ) , and should be further pursued . More comparative work needs to be done in laboratory and ﬁeld settings to fully understand the highly conserved APR in relation to host life - history and parasite - mediated selection . Studies that focus upon identifying the immune – endocrine – behavior interrelationships that may proxi - mately mediate life - history trade - offs between parasite defense and other competing physiological processes , such as reproduction and molt , would be particularly helpful . Such avenues of research could include assessment of cytokine gene expression and their receptors in various tissues , characterization and measurement of pro - inﬂam - matory avian cytokines , as well as identifying additional constraints on metabolism , growth , and endocrine cascades S588 J Ornithol ( 2007 ) 148 ( Suppl 2 ) : S583 – S591 123 that are critical to normal life - history functions . Estimating the energy requirements to produce an APR in relation to other immunological defenses would also be useful in determining allocation constraints . A ﬁnal future direction to pursue is whether APR modulation involves any long - term costs and beneﬁts , such as variation in fecundity , survivorship , and disease resistance .
