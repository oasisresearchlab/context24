Saunders 1 , 7 * The dynamic assembly of multiprotein complexes is a central mechanism of many cell signaling pathways . This process is key to maintaining the spatiotemporal specificity required for an accurate , yet adaptive , re - sponse to rapidly changing cellular conditions . We describe a technique for the specific isolation and downstream proteomic characterization of any two interacting proteins , to the exclusion of their individual moieties and competing binding partners . We termed the approach bimolecular complementation affinity purification ( BiCAP ) because it combines the use of conformation - specificnanobodies witha protein - fragment complementationassaywithaffinitypurification . UsingBiCAP , wecharacterizedthespecificinteractomeofthe epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) family member ERBB2 when in the form of a homodimer or when in the form of a heterodimer with either EGFR or ERBB3 . We identified dimer - specific interaction patterns for key adaptor proteins and identified a number of previously unknown interacting partners . Functional analysis for one of these newly identified partners revealed a noncanonical mechanism of extracellular signal – regulated kinase ( ERK ) activation that is specific to the ERBB2 : ERBB3 heterodimer and acts through the adaptor protein FAM59A in breast cancer cells . INTRODUCTION Intracellular signaling networks are the master regulators of processes such as mitosis , apoptosis , migration , and differentiation . Although the phos - phorylation of kinase substrates can alter their activity , localization , or stability , the modulation of protein - protein interactions at these phospho - rylation sites also serves as a major mechanism to maintain the specificity and dynamic properties of signaling pathways ( 1 , 2 ) . Consequently , signif - icant effort has been invested in developing techniques to identify and quan - tify protein - protein interactions relevant to cell signaling . Affinity purification coupled with tandem mass spectrometry ( AP - MS / MS ) has emerged as a powerful technology to characterize the interactome of any given protein . Although a number of seminal MS - based studies have greatly increased our understanding of the dynamic nature of protein - protein interactions ( 3 – 5 ) , these approaches are often limited to the analysis of an individual protein in all potential binding states . Many proteins are activated or inhibited upon dimerization or complex formation , considerably altering the dynamics of a signaling pathway . It is therefore an experimental imper - ative that further techniques are developed , which can dissect these multi - protein complexes and characterize the specific function of each modular component within specific spatial and temporal contexts . In response to this challenge , we developed a novel method for the specific isolation and characterization of the interactome of any binary protein complex . This approach combines a protein - fragment complementation assay and affinity purification with a conformation - specific nanobody , which we have termed bimolecular complementation affinity purification ( BiCAP ) . This novel technique exploits a neoepitope formed by complementation of Venus fluorescent protein fragments to specifically isolate any pair of inter - acting proteins while excluding competing binding partners and those binding to individual components in isolation . A further advantage of this approach is the simultaneous visualization of cellular localization of inter - acting protein pairs . We have applied this approach to characterize the inter - actome of the receptor tyrosine kinase ( RTK ) oncogene ERBB2 , which can exist as either a monomer , a homodimer , or a heterodimer with other members of the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) family ( 6 ) . The formation of heterodimers within the EGFR family has long been thought to diversify the interactome and signaling capacity of these receptors when compared to receptor homodimers ( 7 – 10 ) . In breast cancer cells where ERBB2 is amplified , and therefore overexpressed , the formation of ERBB2 - containing heterodimers can be driven in a ligand - independent manner ( 8 , 11 ) . ERBB2 is the preferred dimerization partner for EGFR and ERBB3 ( 12 ) , and the signals emanating from these heterodimers are known to be significantly stronger than those from other EGFR family receptor combinations ( 6 ) . Each of these receptors is also a potent breast cancer oncogene and the target of multiple therapeutic agents ( 6 , 8 ) . Despite promising initial results in clinical trials , acquired resistance frequently emerges with both antibody and small - molecule therapies directed toward these EGFR family members ( 13 ) . A shift in the dimerization profile of ERBB2 is recognized as a common mecha - nism underlying resistance to ERBB2 - targeting therapies ( 13 , 14 ) , although this plasticity of ERBB2 also highlights a broader emerging theme in cancer research , where a thorough understanding of the dynamic and adaptable be - havior of signaling networks will be required to ultimately deliver specific and efficient cancer therapies ( 15 ) . To date , defining the specific interactomes of ERBB2 - containing homo - and heterodimers has been hindered by 1 The Kinghorn Cancer Centre , Garvan Institute of Medical Research , Sydney , New South Wales 2010 , Australia . 2 St .

The application of BiCAP largely overcomes these limitations , facilitating characterization of the individual interactome of each of these ligand - independent receptor dimers . RESULTS Bimolecular fluorescence complementation for ERBB2 homodimers Protein - fragment complementation assays are frequently used to visualize and quantify the interaction between two proteins in live cells . This technique relies upon the expression of bait and prey proteins fused to split domains of a reporter such as luciferase ( 16 ) , b - galactosidase ( 17 ) , or green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) ( 18 ) . Interaction between bait and prey proteins drives re - folding of the fused fragments into a functional reporter protein , generating a measurable signal . In the case of a protein - fragment complementation assay based on a split fluorescent protein such as GFP ( or its variants ) , the term bimolecular fluorescence complementation ( BiFC ) is frequently used ( 19 ) . The individual N - and C - terminal fragments of the GFP family pro - teins are nonfluorescent and associate with low affinity in the absence of an interaction between fusion partners . However , their close colocalization upon interaction of bait and prey fusion proteins favors refolding of these split domains into a functional b - barrel structure containing the fluorophore ( 18 ) . This is demonstrated using a well - described homodimer formed by ERBB2 . We engineered C - terminal fusions of ERBB2 with complementary BiFC fragments comprising either the N - terminal ( Met 1 - Gln 157 ) or C - terminal ( Lys 158 - Lys 238 ) regions of the Venus fluorescent protein , which is an engi - neered derivative of GFP . These vectors were termed ERBB2 - V1 and ERBB2 - V2 , respectively ( Fig . 1A ) . Transfection of plasmids encoding these individual fusion proteins into human embryonic kidney ( HEK ) – 293T cells did not produce any fluorescent signal ( fig . S1A ) . However , cotransfection of both plasmids generated a predominantly membranous fluorescent signal , as expected from the formation of an RTK dimer ( Fig . 1B and fig . S1A ) . This transient transfection approach achieved an abundance of ERBB2 that was similar to that in ERBB2 - amplified breast cancer cell lines AU565 and SKBR3 ( fig . S1B ) . Although BiFC enables the visualization of specific ERBB2 homodimers , the ability to isolate and characterize these dimers ( while excluding non - dimerized ERBB2 monomers and alternative heterodimers ) using standard immunoprecipitation approaches is problematic . For example , whereas we A ERBB2 - V1 + ERBB2 - V2 DAPI B V1 V2 Bindinginterface GFP - Trap nanobody RecombinedVenus FP 90 o C E D Fig . 1 .

SCIENCESIGNALING . org 12 July 2016 Vol 9 Issue 436 ra69 2 observed about equal expression of ERBB2 - V1 and ERBB2 - V2 after co - transfection of HEK - 293T cells , a higher proportion of ERBB2 - V1 than ERBB2 - V2 was detected after immunoprecipitation using an antibody raised against the N - terminal region of GFP ( Fig . 1C ) . Hence , this approach is not able to adequately enrich for ERBB2 dimers as a fraction of the total ERBB2 population , and the greater presence of ERBB2 monomers or heterodimers would confound attempts to characterize ERBB2 dimer – specific interac - tomes and signaling complexes . Thus , a more elegant approach is needed to facilitate the specific isolation and characterization of ERBB2 binary protein complexes . Bimolecular complementation affinity purification Analysis of the binding epitope of a GFP - Trap ( 20 ) suggested that it may provide a suitable affinity purification matrix for specific enrichment of ERBB2 BiFC dimers while excluding monomeric ERBB2 . GFP - Trap is a recombinant antibody fragment ( nanobody ) that binds with high affinity to GFP and its derivatives ( YFP , CFP , Venus , Citrine , and AcGFP ) ( 20 ) . GFP - Trap recognizes a three - dimensional epitope on the b barrel of GFP created by noncontiguous amino acid sequences . Closer analysis of this binding epitope showed that it spans a surface of the fluorescent protein b barrel , which is composed of both the V1 and V2 BiFC fragments ( Fig . 1D ) . This suggests that GFP - Trap recognizes a neoepitope that exists on correctly recombined and folded Venus but that does not exist on the individual BiFC fragments . Hence , we hypothesized that GFP - Trap would bind spe - cifically to recombined Venus but not to the individual Venus fragments used for BiFC . We tested the ability of GFP - Trap to specifically enrich for ERBB2 dimers after cotransfection of HEK - 293T cells with ERBB2 - V1 and ERBB2 - V2 . The presence of both ERBB2 - V1 and ERBB2 - V2 in GFP - Trap eluate from cotransfected cells , but not from cells transfected with either ERBB2 - V1 or ERBB2 - V2 alone ( Fig . 1E ) , demonstrates that GFP - Trap specifically isolated the ERBB2 homodimer but was unable to bind ERBB2 - V1 or ERBB2 - V2 in isolation . This unique combination of a protein - fragment complementation assay with a conformation - specific nanobody therefore provides a powerful method to isolate protein com - plexes while excluding the uncomplexed individual components and com - peting binding partners . A further advantage of this system is the ability to visualize protein interactions in situ , providing confirmation of cellular context . We have termed this novel technique BiCAP . Characterization of dimer - specific ERBB2 interactomes by BiCAP BiFC has previously been used to visualize the formation of EGFR family dimers ( 21 ) , but here , we sought to demonstrate the utility of the BiCAP approach by applying it to characterize the specific interactomes of ERBB2 homodimers or ERBB2 heterodimers with EGFR or ERBB3 ( Fig . 2A ) . Ex - pression of individual heterodimer components was confirmed by Western blotting cell lysates from HEK - 293T cells cotransfected with BiFC - tagged receptor pairs ( Fig . 2B ) . A prominent membranous fluorescent signal was observed for each dimer , indicating the formation of plasma membrane – localized receptor dimers ( Fig . 2C ) . Notably , ERBB3 : ERBB2 dimers also displayed a distinct perinuclear signal . Label - free quantitative MS analysis of BiCAP - isolated receptor dimers ( Fig . 2D ) revealed distinct interac - tomes for each dimer pair ( Table 1 ) . Analysis of known protein - protein interactions using the String database ( 22 ) highlighted the existence of a number of established functional clusters in the individual interactome of each receptor dimer ( Fig . 2E ) . A prominent core group of 10 proteins was observed in the interactome of all three receptor dimers ( Fig . 3 ) . This core interactome contains many established components of RTK signaling pathways , including the adaptor proteins GRB2 and SHC1 , known to in - teract with various activated RTKs and activate RAS signaling ( 23 , 24 ) through the guanine nucleotide exchange factor ( GEF ) Son of Sevenless homolog 1 ( SOS1 ) ( 25 ) . ERBB receptor feedback inhibitor 1 ( ERRFI1 ) , otherwise known as mitogen - inducible gene 6 ( MIG6 ) , is known to inter - act with and inhibit the kinase domains of EGFR family members ( 26 – 28 ) , whereas the GEFs VAV2 and VAV3 are established links between EGFR family members and guanosine triphosphatase activation ( 29 , 30 ) . A small group of proteins were detected interacting exclusively with ERBB2 homodimers , consisting of transferrin receptor ( TFRC ) , endoplasmic reticulum lipid raft associated 1 ( ERLIN1 ) , and protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor type 9 ( PTPN9 ) . ERBB2 is a substrate of PTPN9 , which at - tenuates activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription proteins downstream of ERBB2 ( 31 ) . Although the specific function of the ERLIN1 and TFRC interactions is not yet known , the presence of these may be sug - gestive of the localization of ERBB2 homodimers within lipid rafts and re - cycling endosomes , respectively ( 32 ) . Another small group of proteins interacted exclusively with the EGFR : ERBB2 heterodimer . These include the E3 - ligase c - Cbl , which ubiquitinates activated EGFR to promote its deg - radation ( 33 ) , and phospholipase C g 1 ( PLCG1 ) , which drives the activa - tion of protein kinase C ( PKC ) after binding to activated EGFR ( 34 ) . Only three proteins were observed to interact specifically with both ERBB2 homo - dimers and EGFR : ERBB2 heterodimers : ubiquitin - associated and Src ho - mology 3 ( SH3 ) domain – containing B ( UBASH3B ) , SOS2 , and ERBB4 . UBASH3B interferes with Cbl - mediated degradation of activated EGFR ( 35 ) , which may indicate increased stability of the EGFR : ERBB2 dimer ( 32 ) , although the interaction of these dimers with ERBB4 may also indicate potential formation of higher - order receptor complexes within the EGFR family ( 36 , 37 ) . As may be expected , a number of interacting proteins play a role in the endocytosis , sorting , and recycling of RTKs . For example , CHMP5 , which interacted with EGFR : ERBB2 , is a component of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport III ( ESCRT - III ) and plays an essential role in trafficking and degradation of growth factor receptors ( 38 ) . The clathrin adaptor proteins AP2M1 and AP1M1 , which were present in complex with both the EGFR : ERBB2 and ERBB3 : ERBB2 heterodimers , bind to transmembrane cargo proteins and thus play a major role in trafficking via clathrin - coated vesicles . The absence of these trafficking - related proteins from the ERBB2 homodimer is in keeping with the concept that ERBB2 , unlike EGFR and ERBB3 , may have an impaired ability to undergo endo - cytosis due to a lack of C - terminal internalization signals ( 32 ) . By far , the largest group of proteins , representing a diverse group of 44 proteins , was found to interact exclusively with ERBB3 : ERBB2 heterodimers . Many of these proteins are associated with the ribosome or RNA bind - ing and splicing ( RBMX , RAE1 , EIF3B , STAU1 , PRKRA , RSL1D1 , HNRNPC , SNRPD1 , SRSF5 , HNRNPA0 , RPF2 , PABPN1 , RBM34 , ELAVL1 , RRS1 , LTV1 , U2AF2 , and BRIX1 ) or to have a role within the nucleus ( NOP2 , TPR , RANBP2 , LYAR , EBNA1BP2 , and SAFB ) . There was also a large group of mitochondrial proteins ( MRPS22 , MRPS34 , AIFM1 , MRPS16 , MRPS5 , MRPS26 , MRPS25 , MRPS18B , and MRPS9 ) . Smaller groups of proteins were also identified with more specialized roles as either cytoskeletal / structural proteins ( SPTAN1 , INA , and DSG2 ) , tran - scription factors ( TP53 and NKRF ) , or signaling pathway components ( FAM59A , PIK3R2 , GNAI1 , and PLCG2 ) . Within this system , the expanded interactome of ERBB3 : ERBB2 may potentially be influenced by the distinct intracellular localization of this heterodimer ( Fig . 2A ) . Observations of intracellular ERBB3 are not un - common , including the detection of functional ERBB3 : ERBB2 heterodimers in the nucleus ( 39 – 42 ) . Therefore , the intracellular localization of ERBB3 : ERBB2 heterodimers within this BiFC system does not appear to be an artefact of transfection because this localization is also consistent with that R E S E A R C H A R T I C L E www .

SCIENCESIGNALING . org 12 July 2016 Vol 9 Issue 436 ra69 5 ( Fig . 4A ) . Given the importance of protein - protein interactions in determining the specificity of pathway activation , it is likely that the observed diversity in the interactome of each receptor dimer may underlie their differential signaling potential . Taking the mitogen - activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) pathway com - ponents as an example , quantitative BiCAP data indicated that EGFR : ERBB2 dimers bound proportionally more GRB2 , and therefore SOS , than did the other two dimers ( Fig . 4B ) . In contrast , SHC binding was increased for both the EGFR : ERBB2 and ERBB3 : ERBB2 heterodimers ( Fig . 4B ) . In support of these MS - based observations , we also found that this pattern of inter - action was recapitulated by Western blotting ( Fig . 4C ) . Previous studies into signaling pathway activation downstream of the EGFR family show that homodimers generally have weak signaling capacity ( 6 , 8 ) and that ERBB2 - containing heterodimers elicit stronger signals than do other possible combinations ( 6 ) . Consistent with these studies and the model of protein - protein interactions mediating signaling pathway activity , we observed significantly increased extracellular signal – regulated kinase ( ERK ) activation downstream of EGFR : ERBB2 and ERBB3 : ERBB2 re - ceptor heterodimers but not downstream of ERBB2 homodimers ( Fig . 4D ) . This trend tends to more closely follow the strength of the SHC1 interac - tion rather than GRB2 , in line with previous observations , suggesting that interaction with SHC1 is essential for MAPK pathway activation by ERBB3 ( 43 ) . However , a further mechanism driving MAPK activation downstream of the ERBB3 : ERBB2 dimer could also be the interaction with FAM59A , which is only observed for this specific heterodimer using BiCAP and Western blotting ( Figs . 3 and 4 , B and C ) . FAM59A , also known as GRB2 - associated and regulator of ERK / MAPK ( GAREM ) , is a recognized com - ponent of receptor - associated signaling complexes ( 4 , 44 ) and promotes ERK activation downstream of EGFR stimulation ( 45 ) . FAM59A acts by binding to the SH3 domains of GRB2 and facilitates ERK activation in an SOS - independent manner ( 45 ) . This mechanism is consistent with an ab - sence of SOS1 or SOS2 in the interactome of ERBB3 : ERBB2 heterodi - mers ( Table 1 and Figs . 2D and 3 ) , which nonetheless strongly activated ERK signaling ( Fig . 4D ) . FAM59A drives ERK activation by ERBB3 : ERBB2 heterodimers To investigate FAM59A - driven ERK activation from ERBB3 : ERBB2 hetero - dimers in an endogenous setting , we performed Western blotting for FAM59A , EGFR , ERBB2 , and ERBB3 in a panel of 25 breast cancer cell lines ( Fig . 5A ) . As expected , EGFR was highest in basal breast cancer lines and ERBB2 was mostly restricted to clinically defined ERBB2 + cell lines and some luminal lines , whereas ERBB3 was present mostly in lu - minal and ERBB2 + lines . FAM59A is known to be ubiquitously expressed ( 46 ) . Accordingly , FAM59A was present across all breast cancer subtypes , although slight - ly higher in basal lines . Therefore , FAM59A was present in all ERBB2 / ERBB3 - positive cell lines , although the increased FAM59A in basal breast cancer lines potentially indi - cates other signaling roles within these cells . Although we could detect ERBB3 : ERBB2 heterodimers by coimmunoprecipita - tion in four ERBB2 + cell lines ( fig . S4 ) , this technique was unable to detect the interac - tion between this heterodimer and FAM59A . Therefore , to confirm that FAM59A inter - acts with ERBB2 in breast cancer cell lines , we used PLA , which has previ - ously been used to visualize and quantify the interaction between GRB2 and EGFR ( 47 ) . Using this technique , the interaction between ERBB2 and FAM59A could be observed in the ERBB2 - and ERBB3 - positive ZR75 - 30 , SKBR3 , and AU656 cell lines ( Fig . 5B and fig . S5 ) . Further investigation of this interaction in the MDA - MB - 330 cell line ( Fig . 5C ) revealed that endog - enous ERBB2 and ERBB3 were both localized in a punctate manner at the plasma membrane and in the cytoplasm , whereas endogenous FAM59A was also punctate but predominantly cytoplasmic . The dependency of the ERBB2 - FAM59A interaction upon ERBB3 : ERBB2 dimer formation was supported by analysis of the ERBB2 - FAM59A PLA signal in MDA - MB - 330 cells , where a significant decrease in PLA signal was observed in cells treated with ERBB3 siRNA compared to cells treated with control siRNA ( Fig . 5C ) . The functional relevance of this signaling complex was highlighted by a significant reduction in ERK phosphorylation ( Fig . 5D ) and colony formation ( Fig . 5E ) after FAM59A knockdown in MDA - MB - 330 cells . These results were also recapitulated in the SKBR3 cell line using two independent siRNAs against FAM59A ( fig . S6 ) . Whereas FAM59A knockdown reduced ERK activation , ERBB3 knockdown reduced both ERK and AKT activation in MDA - MB - 330 cells ( Fig . 5D ) . This is consistent with our observed interaction between the ERBB3 : ERBB2 dimer and PIK3R2 ( Fig . 2D ) , and the six high - affinity binding sites for phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) – p85 within ERBB3 ( 48 – 50 ) . This ability of ERBB3 : ERBB2 heterodimers to promote signaling through AKT is thought to drive oncogenic PI3K pathway activation in breast cancer ( 51 ) . Through the application of our novel BiCAP technique , we have now demonstrated an additional and specific role for this heterodimer in the activation of ERK signaling and cell proliferation through a GRB2 - FAM59A signaling axis . DISCUSSION The EGFR family members have been the subject of intensive research for the last few decades , although to date no method has allowed the sensitive and accurate discrimination of dimer - specific interactomes . Application of BiCAP to characterize the interactomes of the ERBB2 homodimer and heterodimers with EGFR and ERBB3 has overcome a number of lim - itations in existing approaches and revealed that although they share a core Fig . 3 . Combined analysis of interactome diversity in ERBB2 - containing dimers .

SCIENCESIGNALING . org 12 July 2016 Vol 9 Issue 436 ra69 6 group of interacting proteins , each receptor pair also has a unique repertoire of individual binding partners . The identification of this expected core group of proteins validates the BiCAP approach , although one unexpected omission from this core group is the adaptor protein GRB7 , which is known to bind with high affinity to ERBB2 through its SH2 domain ( 52 ) . Although GRB7 and ERBB2 are coamplified and coexpressed in some tumor types ( 53 ) , the use of a HEK - 293T transfection model in this study may have precluded the identification of this particular interaction . Each of these receptors in isolation is potentially capable of binding a diverse set of interacting proteins , the most thoroughly characterized being the SH2 and PTB domain – containing pro - teins that are recruited by an array of differ - ent phosphosites on each receptor ( 48 , 49 ) . This type of motif - based analysis is broadly consistent with the interactions that we ob - served for GRB2 but not for interactions with SHC1 . We detected a much higher lev - el of GRB2 binding by the EGFR : ERBB2 heterodimer than the ERBB2 homodimer or ERBB3 : ERBB2 heterodimer , consist - ent with motif analysis , which predicts that EGFR has six GRB2 - binding sites , ERBB2 has only one , and ERBB3 has two ( 48 ) . However , this correlation is not ap - parent when considering SHC1 binding ; both EGFR : ERBB2 and ERBB3 : ERBB2 heterodimers bind substantially more SHC1 than the ERBB2 homodimer , even though EGFR has six predicted SHC1 binding sites , whereas ERBB2 has five and ERBB3 has only one ( 48 ) . These con - flicting observations highlight the limita - tion of motif - based interaction analysis in isolation , whereas the binding capa - city of protein dimers in vivo may be heavily influenced by a combination of orthogonal factors . Although relative interaction ratios may not be accurately predicted by motif - based analysis alone , the promiscuous nature of ERBB3 : ERBB2 dimers has been previ - ously inferred from this method ( 49 ) . However , our BiCAP data now confirm this promiscuity with experimental data ob - tained using a technique that can specifical - ly isolate and directly compare these dimers . The oncogenicity of receptor dimers within the EGFR family has been shown to be rel - ative to their promiscuity in binding part - ners ( 49 ) , consistent with the observation that ERBB2 : ERBB3 has the most potent transforming capacity ( 2 , 39 , 54 ) . This increased binding capability of the ERBB3 : ERBB2 dimer may be due to the unique C - terminal region of ERBB3 , which has the lowest homology between members of the EGFR family ( 48 ) , although , in this system , it also appears that the expanded repertoire of proteins interacting with ERBB3 : ERBB2 may also be influenced by the differing subcellular local - ization of this heterodimer ( Fig . 2A ) . The ability of the ERBB3 : ERBB2 heterodimer to activate AKT signaling is well established ( 50 ) , although from the intersection of our novel interactomics approach and biochemical assays in breast cancer cells we have now unveiled an additional , noncanonical , SOS - independent mechanism of ERK activation for this heterodimer that relies on FAM59A . In addition to our study , previous proteomics studies have demon - strated that each of SOS1 , SOS2 , and FAM59A appears to interact with GRB2 in a constitutive manner ( 44 ) , suggesting the existence of an un - known regulatory mechanism that potentially drives the association of D C B A Fig . 4 .

The following day , 20 m l of iodo - acetamide ( 5 mg / ml ) ( Life Science , Sigma - Aldrich , GmbH ) was added to the trypsin digest and incubated for 30 min in the dark . Digested peptides were acidified with 1 m l of trifluoroacetic acid ( TFA ) ( Fluka BioChemika , Sigma - Aldrich , GmbH ) to inhibit trypsin and to acidify peptides for C18 StageTip desalting . C18 StageTips were constructed by stacking six layers of 3M Em - pore solid phase extraction C18 ( Octadecyl ) membrane with a total binding capacity of 30 m g ( 3M ; Agilent Technologies ) into a 200 - m l micropipette tip . C18StageTipswerepreparedbywettingwithmethanol ( VetecFineChemicals ) , equilibration with 0 . 1 % ( v / v ) TFA , 80 % ( v / v ) acetonitrile optima LC / MS ( MeCN ) ( FisherScientific ) , followedbywasheswith0 . 1 % ( v / v ) TFA . Acidified peptides were loaded onto the C18 StageTips and then washed with 0 . 1 % ( v / v ) TFA . Peptides were eluted using a two - step elution with 0 . 1 % ( v / v ) TFA , 80 % ( v / v ) MeCN and then dried using a vacuum concentrator . Dried pep - tides were stored at − 80°C . NanoLC - MS / MS Desalted peptides were resuspended in 5 % ( v / v ) formic acid , carefully loaded onto an LC plate , and placed into an EASY - nLC system ( Thermo Scientific ) . Peptides were loaded onto a 20 - cm column with a 75 - m m inner di - ameter , packed in - house with 1 . 9 m m C18 ReproSil particles ( Dr . Maisch GmbH ) . Peptides were eluted using a linear gradient of acetonitrile at 250nl / minover140min . TheEASY - nLCsystemwasconnectedtoanOrbitrap Velos Pro mass spectrometer ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) with a nanospray source . Positive ionswere generated using electrospray and the Orbitrap op - erated in data - dependentacquisition mode . Uptothe10mostabundantions with charge states > + 2 were sequentially isolated and fragmented within the R E S E A R C H A R T I C L E www . SCIENCESIGNALING . org 12 July 2016 Vol 9 Issue 436 ra69 9 lineariontrapusinghigher - energycollisionaldissociation . Themass / charge ( m / z ) ratios selected for MS / MS were dynamically excluded for 30 s . MaxQuant software version 1 . 2 . 7 . 4 ( 60 ) was used to process raw MS data ( using default settings ; tables S1 and S2 ) . The Andromeda search en - gine integrated into MaxQuant was used for database searching against the UniProt Human _ 11 _ 2013 database ( 61 ) . FDRs for protein , peptide , and sites were controlled at a maximum of 1 % , and one missed cleavage was tolerated . Dataanalyseswereperformedusingamodifiedstatisticalanalysis workflow based on Perseus analysis workflow in the R software en - vironment ( 60 , 62 , 63 ) . Briefly , LFQ intensities of proteins identified using MaxQuant were transformed and filtered followed by normalization and imputation before statistical analysis to identify interacting proteins of each dimer pair by comparison with Venus control to exclude nonspecific backgroundbindersusingStudent ’ s t testandBenjamini - Hochbergcorrection for multiple comparisons ( analysis workflow is summarized in fig . S8 and complete data set is in table S3 ) ( 60 ) . Nonunique peptides corresponding tohighlyconservedregionsofEGFRandERBB2wereexcluded . Dataquality was confirmed by comparison of individual histograms , multiple regression , and hierarchical clustering . Data were deposited into the ProteomeXchange database ( accession PXD004148 ) . Functional pathway analysis Gene names of BiFC dimer – interacting proteins were loaded into String ( v9 ) protein interaction database ( 64 ) . An interaction network was gener - ated , which showed all known protein - protein interactions based on exper - imental evidence ( excluding computational predictions ) with a confidence score of 0 . 7 ( high ) . The interaction network was imported into Cytoscape ( 65 ) for visualization and further analysis .
