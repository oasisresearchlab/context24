J ou r na l P r e - p r oo f Journal Pre - proof Abstract Black and Latino populations have been disproportionately burdened by COVID - 19 morbidity and mortality . Subsidized housing , crowding , and neighborhood poverty might be associated with increased COVID - 19 transmission and play a role in observed racial and ethnic disparities , yet research is limited . Our study investigated whether these housing variables mediate the relationship between race and ethnicity and SARS - CoV - 2 antibody seropositivity among New York City ( NYC ) adults . We analyzed data from a SARS - CoV - 2 serosurvey ( n = 1074 ) , nested within the 2020 cross - sectional NYC Community Health Survey ( June - October 2020 ) . We defined SARS - CoV - 2 seropositivity as either a positive blood test for SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies or a self - reported positive test result . We used causal mediation analyses to test whether subsidized housing , crowding , and neighborhood poverty mediate a relationship between race and ethnicity and seropositivity . After controlling for potential confounding , we found elevated prevalence ratios of SARS - CoV - 2 seropositivity among Black ( APR = 1 . 74 , 95 % CI = 1 . 10 - 2 . 73 ) and Latino ( APR = 1 . 58 , 95 % CI = 1 . 05 - 2 . 37 ) residents compared with White residents and for those living in crowded housing ( APR = 1 . 48 , 95 % CI = 1 . 03 - 2 . 12 ) and high - poverty neighborhoods ( APR = 1 . 54 , 95 % CI = 1 . 12 - 2 . 11 ) but not for subsidized housing . We observed statistically significant natural direct effects for all three mediators . While living in crowded housing and high - poverty neighborhoods contributed to racial and ethnic disparities in seropositivity the estimated contribution from living in subsidized housing was - 9 % ( Black ) and - 14 % ( Latino ) . Our findings revealed racial and ethnic disparities in seropositivity of SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies among NYC adults . Unlike crowding and neighborhood poverty , living in subsidized housing did not explain racial and ethnic disparities in COVID - 19 . Keywords : COVID - 19 ; SARS - CoV - 2 ; Subsidized Housing ; Household Size ; Neighborhood Poverty ; Seropositivity J ou r na l P r e - p r oo f Journal Pre - proof Introduction COVID - 19 infection and death rates have been disproportionately high among certain racial and ethnic groups in the United States . Numerous reports have documented how Black Americans continue to face an excessive COVID - 19 burden of illness and death ( Mahajan & Larkins - Pettigrew , 2020 ; Yancy , 2020 ; Yaya et al . , 2020 ) . A nationwide , country - level analysis of COVID - 19 and race found a significant association between the percentage of Black Americans living in a county and the percentage of confirmed COVID - 19 cases , confirmed deaths , and case mortality rates ( Mahajan & Larkins - Pettigrew , 2020 ) . Hispanic Americans also have high hospitalization and mortality rates . As of June 2020 , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that Hispanic Americans have 2 . 8 times the risk of being hospitalized for COVID - 19 and 2 . 3 times the risk of dying due to COVID - 19 compared with Non - Hispanic White persons ( CDC , 2021 ) . Other research found that the COVID - 19 death ratio and infection ratio , defined as the ratio of COVID - 19 deaths or infections in a county to its population , were positively associated with income inequality and race and ethnicity ( Pham & Mitra , 2020 ) . A serosurvey of New York City ( NYC ) residents found a higher prevalence of SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies among Black and Latino residents compared with White residents , indicating higher rates of COVID - 19 transmission in those groups ( Parrott et al . , 2021 ) . Housing type , meaning subsidized housing vs . owned or rented homes / apartments , is a potential mechanism for explaining COVID - 19 racial and ethnic disparities . In NYC and many other municipalities , public housing residents are disproportionately low - income people of color ( Bravve & Bolton , 2012 ; New York University Furman Center , 2019 ) . Poor housing conditions , such as immediate needs for kitchen and bathroom repairs and widespread mold issues , are highly prevalent in NYC Housing Authority ( NYCHA ) buildings ( Gates , 2020 ; Gandour , 2022 ) . Significant research supports the association between poor housing conditions and increased risk for chronic illnesses and infectious diseases ( Krieger & Higgins , 2002 ; Mood , 2005 ; Taylor , 2018 ) . These poor housing conditions could put residents at an increased risk for COVID - 19 . One study found that counties with a higher percentage of households with poor housing had higher incidence of COVID - 19 and COVID - 19 deaths ( Ahmad et al . , 2020 ) . In addition , neighborhood poverty could contribute to racial and ethnic disparities in COVID - 19 outcomes . = A disproportionate number of Black or Latino New Yorkers live in poor neighborhoods that suffer from long - term disinvestment of health - promoting resources and services , which could lead to higher risk of COVID - 19 . According to a California study ( Azar et al . , 2020 ) , higher odds of COVID - 19 hospitalization among Black versus White individuals were J ou r na l P r e - p r oo f Journal Pre - proof partially attributed to neighborhood - level poverty , suggesting a role of mistrust and limited access to culturally appropriate care in the observed racial inequity . Crowding is another potential mechanism that could explain racial and ethnic COVID - 19 disparities . According to the World Health Organization’s Housing and Health Guidelines , crowded housing increases risk of exposure to infectious diseases ( 2018 ) . Living in a crowded household makes it more difficult for individuals with COVID - 19 to self - isolate , putting other household members at risk ( Grijalva et al . , 2020 ; Madewell et al . , 2020 ; Metlay et al . , 2021 ) . In NYC , ZIP codes in the highest quintile of per capita COVID - 19 infections had notably higher shares of crowded units compared to ZIP codes in the lowest quintile— 15 . 2 % and 7 . 3 % , respectively ( New York University Furman Center , 2020 ) . Another study found that average household size was the most important explanatory variable for variations in COVID - 19 infection rates in NYC , with higher case rates in ZIP codes with a larger average household size ( Federgruen & Naha , 2021 ) . Inequities in the ability to work from home throughout the pandemic may also explain differential COVID - 19 outcomes by race and ethnicity . A demographic breakdown of NYC’s essential workers shows that over 75 % of frontline workers were people of color , and of those individuals , most were Black or Hispanic ( Stringer , 2020 ) . One study found that people of color , particularly Black people , were more vulnerable to COVID - 19 infection than White people due to their employment in occupations with frequent exposure to infections and proximity to others ( Hawkins , 2020 ) . Thus , it is possible that racial and ethnic inequities in employment in occupations that allow people to work from home may explain observed inequities in COVID - 19 outcomes . Despite theoretical pathways between housing type , neighborhood poverty , and crowding and increased risk for COVID - 19 infection , there is limited research exploring these variables as potential mechanisms for explaining racial and ethnic inequities in COVID - 19 outcomes . Our study examined whether these housing variables mediate the relationship between race and ethnicity and SARS - CoV - 2 antibody seropositivity among NYC adults . In our secondary analysis , we explored how differences in work from home status by race and ethnicity may contribute to additional risk for COVID - 19 infection . Methods The current study used data from a SARS - CoV - 2 serosurvey , nested within the cross - sectional , phone - based 2020 NYC Community Health Survey ( CHS ) . 1 , 074 individuals participated in the serosurvey from June – October 2020 , and of these , 497 provided whole blood J ou r na l P r e - p r oo f Journal Pre - proof specimens which were then tested for SARS - CoV - 2 IgG antibodies , and 577 participants self - reported SARS - CoV - 2 antibody test results on the CHS ( Parrott et al . , 2021 ) . Weights were created for making inferences to the NYC adult population . Additional details about the CHS and the serosurvey can be found elsewhere ( Alroy et al . , 2021 ; Parrott et al . , 2021 ) . The NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene ( DOHMH ) Institutional Review Board determined that this work was exempt from review as a secondary data analysis . The study outcome was a binary indicator of having either a positive blood test for SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies or a self - report of a positive antibody test result . The exposure variable was race and ethnicity , defined as White ( including Middle Eastern or North African ) ; Black ; Asian or Pacific Islander ; and “other” race . Latino or Hispanic was its own ethnic category . We used race and ethnicity as a proxy for structural racism and its impact on COVID - 19 outcomes . Notably , our racial and ethnic analysis excluded two categories ( Asian or Pacific Islander and “other” ) due to small sample sizes . We considered three possible mediators . The first mediator was subsidized housing , defined as residing in a NYCHA unit or receiving rental assistance such as Section 8 versus another type of housing ( including a rent controlled / rent stabilized unit , owned / rented units , or another housing situation ) . Second , we examined crowding , which we defined as five or more persons in the household . While crowding is often assessed using a ratio of persons per bedroom or room ( Blake et al . , 2007 ) , our survey did not ask about the number or types of rooms in one’s unit . Given that a crowded unit in NYCHA is defined as one where the ratio of person / bedroom is greater than two , and according to NYC Housing and Vacancy Survey , in 2017 , 74 % of occupied units had less than three bedrooms ( U . S . Census Bureau , 2021 ; New York City Housing Authority , 2020 ; Gaumer , 2021 ) , our definition of crowding was appropriate . Finally , we examined neighborhood poverty , classified as the proportion of residents whose income was < 100 % of federal poverty level . Neighborhoods were categorized into one of two groups : low poverty ( < 20 % of residents with incomes below poverty levels ) or high poverty ( ≥20 % ) . For our secondary analysis , we examined whether working from home versus outside the home during the pandemic modified the relationship between housing and seropositivity . This analysis was limited to those who reported that they were currently employed or who had been employed but lost a job due to COVID - 19 . Statistical Analysis J ou r na l P r e - p r oo f Journal Pre - proof We first calculated the prevalence of SARS - CoV - 2 antibody seropositivity and the three mediators by race and ethnicity . We further tested racial and ethnic disparities in seropositivity and three mediators by performing multivariable regression analyses with age group , gender , nativity , employment status , health insurance , and underlying health conditions as potential confounders . We also tested the association between seropositivity and each mediator via multivariable regression using the same set of covariates . The prevalence of seropositivity was > 10 % , indicating violation of the rare disease outcome assumption , where odds ratio from logistic regression overestimates prevalence ratio . To obtain a less biased prevalence ratio , we used Poisson regression models ( Zou 2004 ; Martinez et al . , 2017 ) . . To test mediation by subsidized housing , crowding , or neighborhood poverty , we performed causal mediation analyses . Specifically , we computed mediation weights ( i . e . , inverse of probability of a mediator value ) by using each of three potential mediators as an outcome and the same set of covariates from the main multivariable regression analyses . We then multiplied mediation weights with survey weights and estimated natural direct and indirect effects after accounting for complex sample design . Using the formula proposed by VanderWeele and Vansteelandt ( 2010 ) , we estimated percent mediated for each of three potential mediators . Lastly , to test the effect modification of working from home status s , we restricted our sample to those who were employed and further divided them into two subgroups ( working from home vs . working outside the home ) and repeated the main multivariable regression analysis where the prevalence ratio of seropositivity by race and ethnicity was estimated and tested for each subgroup . All analyses were conducted using SAS Enterprise Guide version 7 . 15 ( Cary , NC ) , SUDAAN 11 . 0 . 1 software ( Research Triangle Park , NC ) , and R software 3 . 5 . 2 ( Vienna , Austria ) Medflex package ( Steen et al . , 2017 ) . Complex sample design and survey weights were accounted for to make inference to the NYC adult population . Statistical significance was determined by a two - sided p - value < 0 . 05 . Results We found that 12 % of New York City adults lived in subsidized housing , 16 % lived in crowded housing , and 39 % lived in high poverty neighborhoods ( Table 1 ) . Higher proportions of Black and Latino New Yorkers lived in subsidized housing ( 18 % and 23 % , respectively ) compared with White residents ( 4 % ) . Similarly , a higher proportion of Black and Latino residents lived in crowded housing ( 22 % and 17 % compared with White residents ( 11 % ) and more than half of all Latino and Black New Yorkers lived in high poverty neighborhoods ( 54 % J ou r na l P r e - p r oo f Journal Pre - proof and 56 % , respectively ) , compared with only 24 % of White residents . These racial and ethnic disparities , except for differences in crowding between Black and White residents , remained after accounting for potential confounding ( data not shown ) . A higher proportion of those 65 years and older lived in subsidized housing compared with younger age groups . While 42 % of households with children were crowded , only 2 % of those without children were crowded . Additionally , foreign - born individuals were more likely to live in crowded housing than U . S . - born individuals ( 20 % vs 12 % ) though there were no meaningful differences between these two groups in subsidized housing or neighborhood poverty . A higher proportion of people with underlying health conditions lived in subsidized housing than those without such conditions ( 17 % vs 7 % ) . This disparity did not exist for crowded housing or neighborhood poverty . Only a small proportion of employed persons lived in subsidized housing , whereas nearly half of those who were unemployed or out of the labor force lived in high poverty neighborhoods . We observed racial and ethnic disparities in seropositivity of SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies ( Table 2 ) . The seropositivity for Black and Latino residents ( 30 . 7 % , 95 % CI = 21 . 9 - 41 . 2 and 30 . 7 % , 95 % CI = 24 . 1 - 38 . 2 , respectively ) was higher than it was for White residents ( 17 . 4 % , 95 % CI = 12 . 5 - 23 . 7 ) . After accounting for potential confounding , prevalence ratios of COVID - 19 seropositivity were higher for Black ( Adjusted Prevalence Ratio ( APR ) = 1 . 74 , 95 % CI = 1 . 10 , 2 . 73 ) and Latino ( APR = 1 . 58 , 95 % CI = 1 . 05 , 2 . 37 ) New Yorkers compared with White New Yorkers . The negative association between subsidized housing and seropositivity was not statistically significant . We observed higher SARS - CoV - 2 seropositivity among those living in crowded housing ( 33 . 2 % , 95 % CI = 23 . 9 - 44 . 1 ) compared with those not in crowded housing ( 22 . 6 % , 95 % CI = 18 . 8 - 27 . 0 ) and among residents in high poverty neighborhoods ( 31 . 6 % , 95 % CI = 25 . 4 - 38 . 6 ) versus low - medium poverty neighborhoods ( 20 . 2 % , 05 % CI = 16 . 0 - 25 . 3 ) . We also observed higher seropositivity prevalence ratio for both living in crowded housing ( APR = 1 . 48 , 95 % CI = 1 . 03 - 2 . 12 ) and high poverty neighborhoods ( APR = 1 . 54 , 95 % CI = 1 . 12 - 2 . 11 ) . According to the causal mediation analysis for subsidized housing residence ( Table 3 ) , excess burden of COVID - 19 among Latino versus White New Yorkers ( APR = 1 . 58 , 95 % CI = 1 . 05 , 2 . 37 ) further increased if the prevalence of living in subsidized housing was fixed at the level that would be observed among White New Yorkers ( PR for natural direct effect = 1 . 67 , 95 % CI = 1 . 39 , 2 . 01 ) . Similarly , higher seropositivity further increased among Black versus White New Yorkers if the prevalence of living in subsidized housing was fixed at the level that J ou r na l P r e - p r oo f Journal Pre - proof would be observed among White New Yorkers ( APR = 1 . 74 , 95 % CI = 1 . 10 , 1 . 74 vs . PR for natural direct effect = 1 . 88 , 95 % CI = 1 . 53 , 2 . 30 ) . However , the natural indirect effect was less than 1 . Although it was not statistically significant , this indicated that living in subsidized housing could be associated with lower seropositivity if we hypothetically assume that everyone living in subsidized housing is a Black or Latino adult . The percent of the observed racial and ethnic disparities in seropositivity mediated by subsidized housing residence was - 14 % ( Latino versus White ) and - 9 % ( Black versus White ) . While the natural direct effects for crowding and neighborhood poverty for Latino or Black versus White were smaller than the overall disparities in seropositivity , the natural indirect effects were greater than 1 . These indicated that crowding and neighborhood poverty contributed to racial and ethnic disparities in seropositivity , although these were not statistically significant . Lastly , focusing on adults who were employed during the study period , we tested effect modification by working from home status . The magnitude of the association between race and ethnicity and seropositivity was higher among those who worked outside the home versus worked from home ( data not shown ) . We observed statistically significant seropositivity disparities between Black and White residents among those who worked outside the home ( PR = 2 . 36 , 95 % CI = 1 . 04 , 5 . 33 ) . Discussion Our analysis reveals , in concordance with existing literature , that race and ethnicity are associated with an increased risk for COVID - 19 infection ( Mahajan & Larkins - Pettigrew , 2020 ; Yaya et al . , 2020 ) . We found that Black and Latino residents had a higher prevalence of COVID - 19 antibodies than White residents . Living in crowded homes and living in high - poverty neighborhoods were also associated with higher COVID - 19 seropositivity ; however , living in subsidized housing was not . Contrary to existing literature that links subsidized housing to poor health outcomes , our causal mediation analysis indicated that living in subsidized housing could be a protective factor against COVID - 19 seropositivity . We hypothesize that subsidized housing , more specifically NYCHA residence , may improve social environment ( e . g . , receiving support from neighbors in times of need ) , which in turn may generate positive health effects . To our knowledge , no studies exist that explore the role of social environment in reducing or increasing the risk of COVID - 19 among individuals from particular racial and ethnic groups . Assuming that persons living in NYC subsidized housing are more likely to live in poor housing conditions ( New York State Department of Health , 2018 ; Gates , 2020 ; Gandour , 2022 ) , these findings contrast with those of J ou r na l P r e - p r oo f Journal Pre - proof Ahmad et al . , ( 2020 ) who concluded that households with poor housing conditions had a higher risk of COVID - 19 ; however , there are key differences between the two studies . Ahmad et al . , analyzed publicly available county - level data on poor housing conditions from 2010 - 2014 and county - level COVID - 19 case data . Our analysis examined individual - level seropositivity and housing - related data , allowing us to account for potential confounding . Additionally , Ahmad et al . defined poor housing conditions as one or more of the following : overcrowding , high housing cost , incomplete kitchen facilities , or incomplete plumbing facilities whereas we tested subsidized housing residence and crowding as separate mediators . Lastly , our seropositive outcome included asymptomatic cases whereas Ahmad and colleagues only included symptomatic cases . Several studies have concluded that household size is correlated with increased COVID - 19 transmission ( Metlay et al . , 2021 ; Sun et al . , 2021 ) . In a cohort study of individuals living in Leicester , UK , the authors found that area - based estimated household size was associated with polymerase chain reaction positivity three weeks following government mandated mobility restrictions ( i . e . , “lockdown” ) but not before ( Martin et al . , 2020 ) . Another study concluded that lockdown interventions in Hunan , China increased transmission risk in households and families ( Sun et al . , 2021 ) . Models by Liu et al . ( 2021 ) suggest that larger household sizes were associated with both increased region - level COVID - 19 incidence and individual - level infection risk during lockdown . While our study did not examine seropositivity prevalence during lockdown months in NYC ( March - May 2020 ) , our results support these previous findings’ conclusion that household size was associated with increased COVID - 19 prevalence . These results have important implications for creating public health policy that addresses how to quarantine at home safely and effectively in large households . One solution could be to implement interventions similar to the NYC Health and Hospitals Take Care Hotel Program , which transformed over 700 hotel rooms to meet people’s isolation needs , including clinical monitoring and case management ( Jordan - Martin et al . , 2020 ) . Under this program , any New Yorker who tested positive for COVID - 19 or may have been exposed to the virus was eligible for a free hotel room for up to 10 days ( Seiferth et al . , 2021 ) . Living in high - poverty neighborhoods compared to low - or medium - poverty neighborhoods was also significantly associated with increased COVID - 19 seropositivity . Additionally , a higher percentage of non - Latino Black and Latino individuals lived in high - poverty neighborhoods compared with White individuals in NYC . Our findings are consistent J ou r na l P r e - p r oo f Journal Pre - proof with those of other studies looking at state and local levels , further supporting the conclusion that COVID - 19 positivity rates are higher among communities with majority non - White residents and communities with high poverty rates ( Li & Yuan , 2021 ; Sehra et al . , 2020 ; Millett et al . , 2020 ) . Several studies posit that historic and present - day racial residential segregation is the most salient factor influencing disparate COVID - 19 outcomes ( Li & Yuan , 2021 ; Lieberman - Cribbin et al . , 2020 ) . Patterns of discrimination have left many communities of color without access to essential resources that would mitigate the social , physical , and economic burden of the COVID - 19 pandemic . For instance , according to NYC DOHMH data from March - April 2020 , the availability of COVID - 19 tests increased proportionally to the number of White residents living in specific NYC ZIP code tabulation areas , but not in proportion to a socioeconomic status index score ( Lieberman - Cribbin et al . , 2020 ) . Our causal mediation analysis provides evidence that neighborhood - level poverty contributed to observed racial and ethnic disparities in COVID - 19 outcomes . More research is needed to understand the causal links between living in high - poverty neighborhoods and increased COVID - 19 prevalence . According to our effect modification analysis , we found statistically significant COVID - 19 disparities between Black and White individuals among those who worked outside the home . Our finding provides empirical support for the argument that increased risk of COVID - 19 among Black and Latino persons is attributable to occupational segregation , whereby a higher percentage of people of color are employed in occupations with more frequent exposures to infected persons because of proximity to others ( Hawkins , 2020 ) . Limitations and Strengths Our study has some limitations . First , CHS data were self - reported , which might be affected by recall and social desirability bias , specifically affecting recall of antibody test results , and potentially underreporting of household sizes . However , an analysis of our respondents who provided both a blood sample and a self - reported test result found that ( 89 % of the results were in concordance ( Parrott et al , 2021 ) . Moreover , other studies have found self - reported medical test results for influenza and HIV to be valid ( King et al . , 2018 ; McCusker et al . , 1992 ) . Second , the inclusion of self - reported antibody tests may have overestimated antibody prevalence by including individuals who were positive at the time of testing but seroconverted by the start of our study period ( Parrott et al . , 2021 ) . However , this is less of an issue with our serosurvey since the period between infection and the serosurvey was relatively short . Third , research shows that some individuals with asymptomatic or mild SARS - CoV - 2 infections may J ou r na l P r e - p r oo f Journal Pre - proof mount a weaker immune response , which leads to development of fewer antibodies or to a faster waning of antibodies compared to those with severe illness ( Bajema et al . , 2021 ; Choe et al . , 2021 ; Long et al . , 2020 ; Shioda et al . , 2021 ) . Although the serological data from this survey were not meant to estimate cumulative incidence of SARS - CoV - 2 infection , some relationships presented here may have been affected by uneven waning across racial and ethnic groups possibly caused by disparities in disease severity . Another limitation with our study is that we only tested three mediators . There are likely other mediators that could explain racial and ethnic disparities not captured by our data . For instance , working from home is a potential mediator ; however , our sample size was not large enough to conduct a mediation analysis since many people in our sample were unemployed or not in the workforce . Additionally , our racial and ethnic analysis excluded two categories ( Asian or Pacific Islander and “other” ) due to small sample sizes . . Lastly , we could not assess whether a respondent lived in a unit that was crowded relative to the number of occupants per bedroom or whether they could successfully quarantine or isolate in their home ; rather we could only analyze total household size . Despite these limitations , our study has several strengths . First , we uniquely linked COVID - 19 seropositivity data with survey data , allowing us to analyze potential mediating variables between race and ethnicity and COVID - 19 outcomes . Second , survey data were collected using complex sample design and were representative of all NYC adults . Third , since we queried seropositivity rather than diagnoses , our results were less likely to be biased by disparate and changing COVID - 19 testing policies and access during the study period . Conclusion We observed racial and ethnic disparities in COVID - 19 seropositivity rates among NYC adults between June - October 2020 . Our results demonstrate that living in high - poverty neighborhoods and living in crowded homes contributes to an excess burden of COVID - 19 among Black and Latino New Yorkers . Conversely , we found that living in subsidized housing could potentially mitigate the risk of COVID - 19 infection among Black and Latino New Yorkers . Given our understanding of the roles of crowding and neighborhood poverty in shaping racial and ethnic COVID - 19 inequities , our findings highlight the importance of NYC’s public health efforts to allocate resources ( e . g . , increased access to testing , vaccination , and treatment ) to high poverty neighborhoods and alleviate crowding via hoteling . The observed protective impact of subsidized housing suggests that housing subsidies are important for addressing health inequity and should be expanded .
