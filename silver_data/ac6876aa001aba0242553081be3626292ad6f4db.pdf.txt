Motif analysis helps to insight into the local topology and functions of complex networks . The social position measure is interpreted as the importance of the node ( user ) within the network . We propose to fuse motif analysis with the social position assessment by colouring the nodes according to the measured position . As the distribution of discovered coloured motifs is utilized to mine the interconnection patterns between nodes , the results allow us to evaluate the influence of social position on the local topology of network connections . The experiment was carried out on the large social network derived from email communication . 1 . Introduction The investigation of the interconnections patterns in the complex social networks is a very resource - consuming task . The methods that are quite useful and effective in small and medium sized social networks fail while applying them to the complex networks . In the case of large networks the solution to the complexity problem , which occurs when the models of interaction are studied , can be the analysis of the local network structures ( small subgraphs , usually sizing up to 7 nodes ) , also known as network motifs . Motif analysis stems from bioinformatics and theoretical biology [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] , where it was applied to the investigation of huge network structures like transcriptional regulatory networks , gene networks or food webs [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] . Such motif analysis enables to reinterpret as well as discover several interesting properties of large biological network structures [ 14 ] , [ 16 ] . In this work we apply this biologically - inspired set of methods to the analysis of email - based social network . Motif analysis offers low computational overhead and opportunity to gain an insight into the local structure of huge networks which otherwise would require prohibitive computations to investigate . Moreover , we go one step beyond the classic motif analysis and divide the three nodes motifs into different classes based on the values of social position measure used in social network analysis . These additional information can be used in order to mine new knowledge from the data about interaction between users . The discovered motifs and their numbers enable to assess which patterns of communication appear often in the large social networks and which are rather rare . The former ones can be seen as these which come into existence in a natural way whereas the latter ones can be treated as the artificial and unnatural . The outcomes of the research on two – coloured , three – nodes network motifs ( triads ) detection and analysis in large email – based social network of the Wroclaw University of Technology ( WUT ) , consisting of over 5 , 700 nodes and 140 , 000 edges are presented in this paper . The colours were assigned to the vertices in such a way that the black colour of the node reflects their low social position whereas the white colour marks high social position . The frequency of occurrence and the distribution of the individual motifs serve as the basis to define the interaction patterns between users . This knowledge allows us to investigate in what kind of motifs ( patterns of interconnection ) people are embedded depending on the values of social position . The rest of the paper is structured as follows : section 2 presents the basic concepts of network motifs as well as the definition and characteristics of social position – the centrality measure utilized in the experiments . Section 3 presents the description of the conducted research , its outcomes and interpretation . Finally , section 4 summarizes the work and defines the next research steps . 2 .

Network Motifs Network motifs [ 12 ] are small subgraphs ( usually 3 up to 7 nodes ) which occur in the given network far more / less often then in corresponding random networks . The measures that are used to evaluate the distribution of network motifs are e . g . Z - score index ( most popular and allowing clear interpretation when comparing the network under consideration to its random counterparts ) as well as simple assessment of the frequency of occurrence for given motif . In order to calculate Z - score value the concentration of motifs is measured for a set of random networks then compared with the network being investigated . The number of random networks used in this process depends on the needs of the researchers - better accuracy requires bigger number of random networks . Note that , our former research has revealed that comparison with 100 random networks provide sufficient accuracy of calculations in the case of the WUT social network [ 6 ] . Z – score Z M of a given motif is defined as follows : randM randM M M n n Z σ − = , ( 1 ) where : n M is the number of occurrences of motif M in the network , randM n and randM σ are the mean and standard deviation of its appearances in the set of random networks [ 5 ] . The Z – score measure calculated for each motif forms the basis to create the motif significance profile of the network . It has been recently shown that distribution of network motifs may help to distinguish and classify complex biological , technical and social networks [ 11 ] . Each class of these networks has its own specific significance profile . Two methods of motif detection can be utilized . The first one assumes exhaustive enumeration of all subgraphs with a given number of nodes in the network . Note that , their computational cost dramatically increases with the network size . The second one is to use random sampling to effectively estimate concentrations of network motifs . Network motifs can be used to describe both topological and functional properties of various networks . For biological networks it was suggested that network motifs play key information processing roles [ 13 ] . For example , so – called Feed – Forward Loop ( motif number 5 in Fig . 1 ) has been shown both theoretically and experimentally to perform tasks like sign – sensitive filtering , response acceleration and pulse – generation [ 9 ] . Such results show that , generally , we may reason about function and properties of very large networks from their basic building blocks [ 10 ] . In another work by Chung - Yuan at al . motif analysis was proved to have the ability of fast detection of the small – world and clustering properties of a network [ 3 ] . Within the area of computer science and social networks very little work has been done with motifs . In [ 11 ] significance profiles for small ( below 100 nodes ) social networks were demonstrated . Exceeding 3 . 5x10 5 nodes WWW network described in [ 1 ] was used to show the effectiveness of sampling algorithm in [ 7 ] . First results for large e - mail based network were presented in [ 6 ] . 2 . 2 . Social Position The social network analysis have provided many measures to determine the characteristics of a member within the network like centrality , prestige , reachability , connectivity [ 2 ] , [ 4 ] , [ 15 ] . All of them indicate the importance of a member in the network . In this paper , another centrality measure called social position will be utilized to colour the vertices in the e - mail social network in the process of triads detection . It enables to estimate how valuable the particular individual within the human community is . The importance of the member in the network , expressed by the social position function , tightly depends on the strength of the relationships that this individual maintains as well as on the social positions of their acquaintances , i . e . the first level neighbours influence the importance of the member in the network [ 8 ] . In other words , the user’s social position is inherited from others but the level of inheritance depends on the activity of the members directed to this person , i . e . intensity of common interaction , cooperation or communication . Social position function SP ( x ) of member x in the social network is calculated as follows : ( ) ( ) ∑ ∈ ⋅ ⋅ + − = M y x y C y SP x SP , ) 1 ( ) ( ε ε , ( 2 ) where : ε – the constant coefficient from the range [ 0 ; 1 ] ; C ( y , x ) – the commitment function that denotes the contribution in activity of y directed to x . In other words , C ( y , x ) expresses the strength of the relationship from y to x ; M – the set that contains all members of the given social network . The value of ε reflects the openness of human social position on external influences : how much x ’s social position is static ( small ε ) or influenced by others ( greater ε ) . The commitment function C ( y , x ) must fulfil the following set of commitments : 35 35 1 . If there is no relationship from y to x then C ( y , x ) = 0 , except condition 5 . 2 . The value of commitment is from the range [ 0 ; 1 ] . 3 . Commitment function to itself equals 0 : C ( x , x ) = 0 . 4 . The sum of all commitments has to equal 1 , separately for each network member : ∀ ( y ∈ M ) ( ) ∑ ∈ M x x y C , = 1 . ( 3 ) 5 . If a member y is not active to anybody , then some others members x are active to y , to satisfy condition 4 ( Eq . 3 ) , the sum 1 is distributed equally among all y ’s acquaintances Note that in order to calculate the social position the social network must not contain any isolated members . This restriction is derived from the lack of possibility to satisfy all enumerated above conditions for such members , especially condition 4 . 3 . Interconnection Patters Analysis 3 . 1 . Data preparation and Plan of Experiments The experiments were carried out on the logs from the Wroclaw University of Technology ( WUT ) mail server , which contain only the emails incoming to the staff members as well as organizational units registered at the university . Based on this information the e - mail based social network was extracted . In such a network the nodes are unique e - mail addresses and the edges reflect the fact that there exists any communication between two distinct e - mail addresses . The size of the network is 5 . 783 nodes and 136 . 830 edges ( Figure 1 ) . First , the data cleansing process was executed . The bad email addresses were removed from the analysis and the duplicates were unified . Additionally , only emails from and to the WUT domain were left . Figure 1 Social network discovered from the email communication between employees of WUT . After that the social position of vertices was assessed . In order to calculate the social position values , the strength of each relationships ought to be evaluated . In other words , for each edge from the WUT social network the commitment function value is calculated . In this experiments , the commitment C ( y , x ) of member y within activity of their acquaintance x is evaluated as the normalized sum of emails’ number from y to x in relation to all emails of y : ⎪⎪⎪⎩ ⎪⎪⎪⎨⎧ = > = ∑ ∑ ∑ ∈ ∈ ∈ 0 ) , ( when , 0 0 ) , ( when , ) , ( ) , ( ) , ( M x M x M x x y A x y A x y A x y A x y C , ( 4 ) where : A ( y , x ) – the function that denotes the number of emails sent by y to x ; m – the number of people within WUT . In the next phase , the values of calculated SP measure were assigned to one of two classes . These classes were created on the basis of the mean value of the social position measure evaluated for WUT social network . In case of social position measure the mean value equals 1 ( see Table 1 ) . Note that over 70 % of nodes have lower social position than 1 ( Table 1 ) . Table 1 The number of nodes in each of the created classes . Social Position SP ( x ) SP ( x ) > 1 SP ( x ) ≤ 1 No . of nodes 1669 4114 % of all nodes 28 . 86 % 71 . 14 % In the next stage one of two colours : white or black , is assigned to nodes . The black colour is assigned to the vertices that social position is lower or equal 1 36 36 whereas the white colour to vertices with social position higher than 1 ( Table 2 ) . Table 2 The colours of vertices and the values of centrality measures corresponding to them Social Position SP ( x ) White node SP ( x ) > 1 Black node SP ( x ) ≤ 1 After that the process of detecting triads ( 3 - node motifs ) within the WUT email social network was performed . Basically , there are 13 different motifs that consist of three nodes each ( Figure 2 ) . Their ID = 1 , 2 , … , 13 are used in the further descriptions interchangeably with the corresponding M1 , M2 , … , M13 . However , the experiments took into consideration motifs with two coloured vertices , so in consequence for each of the 13 motifs four classes of motifs can be enumerated : motifs with all vertices white ( 3W ) , motifs with two vertices black and one white ( 1W2B ) , with two vertices white and one black ( 2W1B ) , and finally three black vertices ( 3B ) . As an example see Figure 3 , where motif with ID 5 was presented along with its coloured derivatives . Figure 2 Directed triads and their IDs that can exist within the social network . Figure 3 Classes of the motifs 3 . 2 . Distribution of Network Motifs in WUT Social Network Triad Significance Profile ( TSP ) for WUT network presented in Figure 4 was computed using the set of 1000 random networks . The considered network reveals the typical properties of social networks – the small – world phenomenon and high clustering . Loosely connected motifs with only 2 edges , like M2 , M3 , M4 , M7 , M10 occur less frequently in comparison to the random networks . As expected , it shows a high clustering level , i . e . high probability that two neighboring nodes have connected neighbors . The only exception is M1 which occurs relatively often . This reflects specific property of large mail – based social network : there are many broadcasting nodes spreading messages ( news , announcements , bulletins ) which are never answered . - 300 - 200 - 100 0 100 200 300 400 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 Motif ID Z - s c o r e Figure 4 Triad Significance Profile ( Z - score values ) of the WUT email - based social network for 1000 numbers of random networks . The above conclusions are also confirmed by the network motifs frequency of occurrence presented in Figure 5 . 5 , 80 22 , 22 6 , 22 1 , 03 1 , 07 9 , 46 0 , 24 0 , 01 6 , 74 0 , 56 1 , 11 0 , 71 44 , 82 0 10 20 30 40 50 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 Motif ID F r e q . o f a pp ea r a n ce [ % ] Figure 5 Frequency of occurrence of the network motifs within WUT network 3 . 3 . Analysis of the Coloured Network Motifs The analysis of coloured motifs in WUT social network enable to describe how the communication between people with different social positions looks like . The first insight into the motifs distribution reveals that the percentage of motifs where all three nodes are white constitutes only small part of all motifs – from 1 . 4 % for M1 up to 5 . 5 % for M9 ( Figure 6 , Table 3 ) . The fact that motifs with all white nodes occur very 37 37 rarely in WUT networks shows the general tendency that people who are important ( hubs with high SP ) communicate mainly with people who are not a crucial nodes of the network ( e . g . their employees ) and rarely only with important people . Moreover , regardless the structure of the subgraph , the motifs that consist of one white node ( high SP ) and two black ones ( low SP ) constitute approximately 44 % of all occurrences of the given motif . However , the insight in M1 has shown that the motif in which the person with high SP ( so called hub ) sends email to less important people ( 14 % of all “1 white – 2 black” , “1W2B” , M1 motif ) occurs six times fewer than the motif in which less important person sends information to both person with low and high SP ( 86 % of all 1W2B M1 motif ) . The second situation is more natural in e - mail social network , i . e . when for example employee sends email to another employee and informs about this fact his / her superior . Similar situation appears in the case of M7 where one node is white and two are black – in 72 % the black node is the middleman whereas the white node only in 28 % . This also means that black nodes are more important in the bridging of network clusters ( M7 is typically formed by the nodes belonging to different groups – this feature is also reflected by its relatively rare occurrence in highly - clusterd social network – see its Z - score of Figure 4 ) . 0 % 20 % 40 % 60 % 80 % 100 % 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 Motif ID [ % ] 3 white 2 white , 1 black 1 white , 2 black 3 black Figure 6 Distribution of coloured network motifs SP [ % ] When taken into consideration 2W1B motifs they constitute around 21 % of motifs from M2 to M13 . The only exception is M1 where 2W1B motifs constitute 15 % of all M1 motifs ( Table 3 ) . In 62 % of M1 motif with two white nodes and one black the middleman is the black node – so this one with low social position . This leads to conclusion that broadcasting nodes does not have high social position – in email networks information spreading role is cannot be associated with the importance of network node . In general , the analysis of mixed coloured motifs has revealed that in the loosely connected subgraphs ( with two edges ) the black nodes ( with low SP ) tend to be the bridges that connect other members of the networks . This confirms the concept of the strength of the weak links within the social networks – nodes with low SP sustain the connectivity and determine large - scale network properties ( clustering ) . Another interesting fact is that there occurs significant number of motifs where all three nodes are black ( 3B ) . Almost 40 % of M1 consists of three black nodes , where only 1 . 4 % of M1 consists of all white nodes . On the other hand 28 % of all M13 motifs ( fully connected subgraph ) posses three black nodes . The distribution of 3B motifs has revealed that the more cohesive motif is , the smaller number of 3B motifs occurs in the given structure . In other words users who are not very important nodes of the network do not tend to create cohesive subgroups .

Conclusion The motif analysis enables detection of the connection patterns within complex social networks . The approach presented in this paper extends existing motif analysis techniques by taking into account the social position of users who are the nodes of the network . This is a continuation of results presented in [ 5 ] , where the influence on the communication intensity on the local network topology was investigated . The obtained results revealed also unknown properties of local topology of social networks that are invisible for simple TSP analysis ( see section 3 . 3 ) . They also formed a basis for entirely new set of large dynamic social network analysis methods which builds on several unique properties of motif analysis : 38 38 • Promising computational cost – even for huge networks TSPs can be obtained with fast sampling algorithms which offers possibility of frequent tracking of social network evolution processes . In future experiments we plan to investigate huge social networks of telecom users ( consisting of millions of nodes ) which can be hardly analysed with classic approaches . • Possible integration with soft computing methods – colouring approach which attributes network nodes and edges with the values of arbitrary parameters coming from social network theory allows association of fuzzy variables ( like “average DP” ) with local network structures / nodes . Future network mining methods may build on this . • The possibility of developing algorithms for inferring global properties ( like clustering coefficient ) of the network from the TSP – first promising results were presented in [ 3 ] for simple Watts - Strogatz social network structures . However , the networks addressed in [ 3 ] were small an simplified models with high symmetry . Applying network sampling and motif analysis to large real networks required confirmation that known network properties are “visible” for these methods . Results presented in this work clearly support this assumption . The next research steps will include the dynamics of the network that will be addressed through : a ) the influence of local topology on changes in the network ; b ) the consequences of attaching / deleting nodes and edges of given type ; and c ) the analysis of changes in the WUT social network during academic year . 5 .
