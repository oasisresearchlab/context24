The deﬁning feature of the PCH proteins is an evolutionarily conserved EFC / F - BAR domain for membrane association and tubulation . In the present study , we solved the crystal structures of the EFC domains of human FBP17 and CIP4 . The structures re - vealed a gently curved helical - bundle dimer of (cid:2) 220 A˚ in length , which forms ﬁlaments through end - to - end interactions in the crystals . The curved EFC dimer ﬁts a tubular membrane with an (cid:2) 600 A˚ diameter . We subsequently pro - posed a model in which the curved EFC ﬁla - ment drives tubulation . In fact , striation of tubular membranes was observed by phase - contrast cryo - transmission electron micros - copy , and mutations that impaired ﬁlament formation also impaired membrane tubulation and cell membrane invagination . Furthermore , FBP17 is recruited to clathrin - coated pits in the late stage of CME , indicating its physiolog - ical role . INTRODUCTION Cell membranes change their shapes upon various activ - ities , such as cytokinesis , cell motility , and endocytosis ( Farsad and De Camilli , 2003 ; McMahon and Gallop , 2005 ; Zimmerberg and Kozlov , 2006 ) . In these processes , a number of membrane - associated proteins are involved in the generation of membrane curvature . These include dynamins , amphiphysins , endophilins , and epsins , which all play a role in clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) and deform liposomes into tubules in vitro through differ - ent mechanisms . Dynamins form ring - or spiral - like ﬁla - ments , which constrain the lipid bilayer into a tubular shape of about 200 A˚ in diameter ( Takei et al . , 1995 ; Hinshaw and Schmid , 1995 ; Schweitzer and Hinshaw , 1998 ; Chen et al . , 2004 ; Roux et al . , 2006 ) . Amphiphysins and endophilins possess the Bin / amphiphysin / Rvs ( BAR ) domain , which itself can deform the lipid bilayer into a tubule of (cid:2) 200 A˚ or larger in diameter ( Takei et al . , 1999 ) . This tubulation activity is mainly attributed to the in - trinsic banana - like shape of the BAR - domain homodimer , which binds to the membrane with its concave surface ( Peter et al . , 2004 ) . Epsins insert an amphipathic a helix into one leaﬂet of the lipid bilayer , which results in an area difference between the inner and outer membrane leaﬂets , leading to membrane tubulation ( Ford et al . , 2002 ) . Endophilin BAR domains use a similar insertion Cell 129 , 761 – 772 , May 18 , 2007 ª 2007 Elsevier Inc . 761 mechanism to cause membrane curvature ( Masuda et al . , 2006 ; Gallop et al . , 2006 ) . CME plays an important role in receptor internalization , synaptic vesicle recycling , and somatic nutrient uptake ( Perrais and Merriﬁeld , 2005 ) . The formation of clathrin - coated vesicles ( CCVs ) involves three steps ( Merriﬁeld et al . , 2005 ; Kaksonen et al . , 2005 ; Perrais and Merriﬁeld , 2005 ) . First , the clathrin coat assembles on the ﬂat mem - brane with other proteins , such as AP - 2 , and captures the cargo to form a hemispherical clathrin - coated pit ( CCP ) . Second , the CCP slowly invaginates , and the actin poly - merizes . Third , scission proteins are recruited to the neck of the invaginated CCP for the separation of the newly formed CCV from the plasma membrane . Epsins partici - pate in the initial clathrin assembly and CCP formation steps ( Ford et al . , 2002 ) , while dynamins play a role in the scission step ( Praefcke and McMahon , 2004 ) . The BAR - domain proteins are involved in multiple steps of en - docytosis , among which their involvement in the scission step may be the most common function in CME ( McMa - hon and Gallop , 2005 ; Kaksonen et al . , 2005 ; Ren et al . , 2006 ) . Pombe Cdc15 homology ( PCH ) proteins are involved in a wide variety of actin - based processes , such as cytoki - nesis , ﬁlopodia formation , CME , and clathrin - independent endocytosis ( Lippincott and Li , 2000 ; Kessels and Qual - mann , 2004 ; Ho et al . , 2004 ; Itoh and De Camilli , 2006 ; Dawson et al . , 2006 ) . The PCH proteins are characterized by the presence of an evolutionarily conserved FER - CIP4 homology ( FCH ) domain , and they induce tubular mem - brane invagination in vivo and deform liposomes into tu - bules in vitro ( Aspenstro¨m , 1997 ; Lippincott and Li , 2000 ; Itoh and De Camilli , 2006 ; Dawson et al . , 2006 ) . The membrane binding and tubulation activities of the PCH proteins were attributed to a domain of (cid:2) 300 amino acid residues encompassing the FCH domain and an ad - jacent coiled - coil region , which has been redeﬁned as the extended FCH ( EFC ) or FCH and BAR ( F - BAR ) domain ( Itoh et al . , 2005 ; Tsujita et al . , 2006 ) . The EFC domain shares weak sequence homology with the BAR domain , and like the self - association of the BAR domain in dimer formation , it also self - associates ( Kessels and Qualmann , 2004 ; Itoh and De Camilli , 2006 ; Dawson et al . , 2006 ) . A clear difference exists between the EFC - and BAR - in - duced tubular membranes : the diameters of the EFC - in - duced tubular membranes are several times larger than those of the tubular membranes induced by the BAR do - main , as revealed by in vitro liposome tubulation experi - ments ( Itoh et al . , 2005 ; Tsujita et al . , 2006 ) . The tubular membrane invagination induced by the PCH proteins may be the outcome of imbalanced endocytic vesicle for - mation caused by enhanced invagination and / or a deﬁ - ciency of dynamin - and actin polymerization - dependent scission ( Itoh et al . , 2005 ; Tsujita et al . , 2006 ) . Most of the PCH proteins contain Src homology 3 ( SH3 ) domains at the carboxyl terminus , and these domains bind to various target molecules , including dynamins and neural Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein ( N - WASP ) ( Lippincott and Li , 2000 ; Kessels and Qualmann , 2004 ; Itoh and De Camilli , 2006 ; Tsujita et al . , 2006 ; Dawson et al . , 2006 ; Takenawa and Suetsugu , 2007 ) . N - WASP plays a primary role in actin nucleation in various cytoskel - etal processes ( Miki and Takenawa , 2003 ) . The actin dy - namics are crucial for the scission step of CME ( Merriﬁeld et al . , 2005 ; Kaksonen et al . , 2006 ) . Formin - binding protein 17 ( FBP17 ) , Cdc42 - interacting protein 4 ( CIP4 ) , and transducer of Cdc42 - dependent actin assembly ( Toca - 1 ) share high sequence homology among each other and constitute a clearly deﬁned sub - family in the PCH protein family ( Ho et al . , 2004 ) , and thus they are designated hereafter as FBP17 / CIP4 - related PCH ( FCRP ) proteins . The FCRP proteins participate in ﬁlopodia formation and in clathrin - dependent and - inde - pendent endocytosis ( Ho et al . , 2004 ; Itoh and De Camilli , 2006 ; Dawson et al . , 2006 ) . To better understand the mechanisms of membrane tu - bulation by the EFC domain , we solved the crystal struc - tures of the EFC - domain dimers of human FBP17 and CIP4 at 2 . 6 and 2 . 3 A˚ resolution , respectively . The struc - tures exhibit a gently curved six - helix bundle , which binds and tubulates the lipid membrane with its concave sur - face . Both proteins form a ﬁlament in the crystals , and the ﬁlament formation is required for their tubulation activ - ities . On this structural basis , we proposed a mechanistic model in which a ring - or spiral - like EFC ﬁlament winds around the tubular membrane . In striking agreement with this model , phase - contrast cryo - transmission electron microscopy ( cryo - TEM ) revealed striation of the tubular membranes . FBP17 was recruited to the CCPs late in CME , suggesting that it plays a role in the invagination and / or scission steps in CME . RESULTS Overall Structures of the EFC Domains of Human FBP17 and CIP4 Initial expression trials in a cell - free translation system , using 26 constructs of human CIP4 with different N - and C - terminal boundaries , yielded several soluble fragments . Among them , one fragment , EFC D N CIP4 ( residues 10 – 303 ) , was expressed at the highest level and yielded crys - tals suitable for structure determination . After the struc - ture determination of EFC D N CIP4 , the crystals of a human FBP17 fragment , EFC FBP17 ( residues 1 – 300 ) , were ob - tained and the crystal structure was determined by the molecular replacement method , using the structure of EFC D N CIP4 as a search model . The models were built for residues 10 – 56 and 64 – 288 for EFC D N CIP4 and residues 1 – 56 and 64 – 288 for EFC FBP17 . The rest of the residues could not be modeled due to poor / disordered electron densities . The two crystal structures are similar to each other , in agreement with the high amino acid sequence identity for the corresponding regions between FBP17 and CIP4 ( 54 % , Figures 1A , 1D , and S1B ) . Superimposi - tion of the EFC - domain structures gave an rmsd of 2 . 15 A ˚ between the corresponding C a atoms over 272 762 Cell 129 , 761 – 772 , May 18 , 2007 ª 2007 Elsevier Inc . residues ( Figures S2A and S2B ) . The structure of the EFC domain is composed of a short N - terminal helix , three long a helices , and a short C - terminal helix followed by an ex - tended peptide of 17 amino acids ( Figure 1A ) . EFC D N CIP4 lacks helix a 1 , as the N - terminal region of nine residues is deleted ( Figure 1D ) . The classical FCH do - main , deﬁned as the N - terminal ca . 60 - residue sequence , corresponds to helix a 2 in our structures ( Figures 1A , 1D , and S1B ) . From the present structures , it is now evident thatallﬁvehelices , includinghelix a 2 , constituteastructur - ally integrated domain ( Figures 1A and 1D ) . The C - terminal 17 - residue extended peptide is also part of the structural domain , as it is involved in homodimerization ( see below ) . We hereafter designate this peptide ( residues 272 – 288 ) as the EFC extended peptide ( EEP ) . Together , residues 1 and 288 of FBP17 deﬁne the structural domain boundaries , which agree well with those identiﬁed as the functional do - main for membrane interaction ( Itoh et al . , 2005 ; Tsujita et al . , 2006 ) . The EFC - Domain Dimer Helices a 2 , a 3 , and a 4 form an intimately packed , six - helix bundle with a neighboring symmetry - related molecule , re - sulting in a gently curved dimer ( Figures 1B , 1C , 1E , 1F , S2A , and S2B ) . The EFC - domain dimers bury large areas of the dimer interfaces ( 4765 and 4020 A˚ 2 per molecule for EFC FBP17 and EFC D N CIP4 , respectively , Figures 1B , 1C , 1E , and 1F ) . The dimer interfaces are mainly hydrophobic , with several charged residues , and involve several prom - inent patches of conserved residues ( Figures S3A and S3B ) . One of the patches is located close to the rotational axis between two monomers and consists of the most highly conserved residues , Arg35 , Glu39 , Tyr42 , Leu46 , and the surrounding residues in helix a 2 ( Figures S1B , S3B , and S3C ) . The replacement of Tyr42 with Glu drasti - cally reduced the solubility of a longer CIP4 fragment , EFC CIP4 ( residues 1 – 303 ) , in the cell - free translation ( data not shown ) , indicating the importance of dimer for - mation in the function of the EFC domain . Another patch of conserved residues was identiﬁed in the more distal part of the dimer interface on helices a 3 and a 4 ( Fig - ure S3B ) . The conserved residues in this patch bind to the latter half of the EEP of the second molecule ( Figures S3B and S3D ) . A CIP4 fragment lacking the EEP was ex - pressed as a soluble protein in the cell - free translation ( data not shown ) , suggesting that the EEP is not critical for dimer formation but stabilizes the formed dimer . The high conservation of the residues involved in the dimer interfaces suggests that all of the PCH proteins adopt similar dimeric structures . Figure 1 .

Cell 129 , 761 – 772 , May 18 , 2007 ª 2007 Elsevier Inc . 763 To conﬁrm that the EFC domain exists as a dimer in so - lution , we measured the molar masses of the EFC - domain fragments by analytical ultracentrifugation ( Figure S4 ) . Sedimentation equilibrium analyses of EFC FBP17 and EFC CIP4 yielded molecular masses of 71 . 5 and 72 . 1 kDa , which are very close to the masses expected for the EFC FBP17 dimer ( 72 . 0 kDa ) and EFC CIP4 dimer ( 71 . 4 kDa ) , respectively , based on their primary structures . No evidence was found for the presence of either monomeric or higher oligomeric species in the sedimentation velocity experiment ( data not shown ) . Therefore , EFC FBP17 and EFC CIP4 exist almost exclusively as dimers under these measurement conditions . The EFC Domain Binds to the Phospholipid Membrane with Its Concave Surface The surface representation of the EFC domain revealed clustering of positively charged residues in wide areas of the concave surfaces ( Figures 1G – 1I and S2C – S2E ) . The conserved residues are also clustered , especially on the concave surface ( Figures 1J – 1L ) . Therefore , the positively charged , conserved residues on the concave surface may be important for the interaction of the EFC domain with the phospholipid membrane . In agreement with this predic - tion , several double mutations of the positively charged residues on the concave surface of EFC FBP17 , such as K33Q + R35Q , K51Q + K52Q , and R113Q + K114Q , reduced the membrane association and tubulation in vitro and im - paired the in vivo membrane invagination induced by the overexpressionofEFC FBP17 ( Tsujitaetal . , 2006 ; Figure1L ) . To conﬁrm this hypothesis , we introduced point mutations into the residues on the concave surface of EFC FBP17 . The replacement of Lys33 with Glu signiﬁcantly reduced the membrane binding and tubulation activities in vitro ( Fig - ures 1L and 2A – 2C ) . This mutation also abolished the membrane invagination induced by GFP - FBP17 in vivo ( Figure 2D ) . In contrast , the replacement of Asp168 with Ala did not signiﬁcantly affect the membrane - binding and tubulation activities ( Figures 1L and 2A – 2C ) . In addi - tion to this mutation , the D168N and D168R mutations also did not affect the membrane invagination induced by GFP - FBP17 in vivo ( Figure 2D ) . These results indicate that the EFC domain binds and tubulates the phospholipid membrane by electrostatic interactions , us - ing the positively charged residues distributed on its concave surface . The EFC and BAR Domains Bind to and Induce Tubular Membranes with Different Diameters The EFC domain forms an antiparallel , six - helix bundle in the middle of the dimer , which is a structural feature shared with the BAR domain and the IRSp53 / MIM Figure 2 .

The BAR domain is involved in membrane bind - ing , membrane curvature sensing , and membrane tubula - tion ( Takei et al . , 1999 ; Peter et al . , 2004 ) . Positively charged residues on the concave surface of the BAR do - main are important for its binding to and tubulation of the negatively charged phospholipid membrane ( Peter et al . , 2004 ) , in a manner similar to that of the phospholipid - bind - ing residues of the EFC domains . Although the EFC and BAR domains share similar di - meric architectures , several aspects of the EFC - domain structure are markedly different from those of the BAR do - main . First , helices a 3 and a 4 are more than 20 residues longer than the corresponding helices of the BAR domain , resulting in a more elongated molecular shape ( Figures 3A and 3B ) . Second , the diameter of the tubular membrane that ﬁts the concave surface of the EFC dimer ( (cid:2) 600 A˚ ) is larger than those of the Drosophila amphiphysin BAR domain ( (cid:2) 220 A˚ ) and the human endophilin BAR domain ( (cid:2) 280 A ˚ ) ( Peter et al . , 2004 ; Masuda et al . , 2006 ; Figures 3A and 3B ) . This larger diameter is partly due to the smaller intersection angle between the three long helices of the ﬁrst and second molecules in the dimer ( Figures 3A and 3B ) . Consistent with this , the dimer - interface residues are not conserved between the EFC and BAR domains . The present ﬁnding that the EFC and BAR domains ﬁt dif - ferent diameters of tubular membrane correlates well with the fact that the diameter of the EFC - induced tubular membrane is several times larger than that of the BAR - induced one ( Itoh et al . , 2005 ; Tsujita et al . , 2006 ) . To address whether the BAR domain and the EFC do - main exhibit different selectivity for the sizes of the lipo - somes , the tubulation activities of the amphiphysin N - BAR domain and EFC FBP17 were compared using lipo - somes with various deﬁned diameters ( Figure 3D ) . The N - BAR domain exhibited the highest tubulation activity for liposomes with diameters of 50 and 100 nm , while EFC FBP17 was more selective for liposomes with diame - ters larger than 100 nm ( Figures 2A and 3D ) . Thus , the EFC domain is more selective for liposomes with lower curvature than the BAR domain , as expected from their structures . Note that the amphiphysin N - BAR domain can induce a longer tubular membrane than that expected from a single liposome , which suggests that it fuses lipo - somes upon tubulation , as reported for the endophilin N - BAR domain ( Gallop et al . , 2006 ) . Parts of helices a 3 and a 4 form a long , kinked , coiled - coil structure protrud - ing from the six - helix bundle ( Figures 1B and 1C ) . A kink is caused in helix a 4 by Pro210 ( Figure 3E ) . This Pro resi - due is strictly conserved among the FCRP proteins ( Fig - ure S1B ) but is replaced by other amino acids in the other subfamilies , such as S . pombe Cdc15 , mammalian PACSINs / syndapins / FAP52 , PSTPIP1 , PSTPIP2 / MAYP , Figure 3 .

The ﬁrst and second mole - cules are colored cyan and magenta , respec - tively . ( D ) Negative staining electron microscopy . Li - posomes of deﬁned maximum diameters ( 0 . 2 mg / ml ) , made with a ﬁlter apparatus , were incubated with N - BAR - or EFC - domain proteins ( 0 . 1 mg / ml ) and then were observed by electron microscopy . The degree of tubula - tion is expressed in the table as + + + + ( very strong ) , + ( weak ) , or (cid:4) / + ( almost nothing ) . ( E ) A stereo ﬁgure of Pro210 and the surround - ing residues in helix a 4 . Pro210 is colored ma - genta . Note that Pro210 breaks the hydrogen bonds in helix a 4 , thereby introducing a kink . Residues are shown as stick models . Cell 129 , 761 – 772 , May 18 , 2007 ª 2007 Elsevier Inc . 765 and NOSTRIN ( Figure S1B and data not shown ) . In order to determine if Pro210 is important for the gently curved overall shape of the dimer ( Figures 1B and 3A ) , a mutant of EFC FBP17 with Pro210 replaced by Ala was prepared and tested for its membrane - binding and tubulation activ - ities . The P210A mutation did not affect the activities ( Fig - ures 2A – 2D ) but modestly increased the diameter of the induced tubular membrane ( Figure S5 ) . Therefore , the Pro210 - induced kink in helix a 4 participates in the mech - anism that forms the gently curved shape and is likely to play a role in ﬁne tuning of the curvature . Filament Formation by the EFC - Domain Dimer Besides the interface for dimerization , we found additional common crystal - packing interfaces between the crystals of the two EFC domains ; the dimers are arranged to form ﬁlaments ( Figure 4A ) . These interfaces involve sev - eral hydrogen - bonding interactions between the neigh - boring symmetry - related dimers ( Figures 4B , 4C , S6A , and S6B ) . First , the main - chain carbonyl and imino groups in the loop for the turn from helix a 3 to helix a 4 ( Figure 4C ) form four hydrogen bonds ( Figures 4B , S6A , and S6B ) in the dimer - dimer interface . Second , Lys166 , which is con - served in the FCRP proteins ( Figure S1B ) , forms hydrogen bonds with three main - chain carbonyl groups of the adja - cent dimer ( Figures 4B and S6A ) . Furthermore , Thr165 is conserved in the a 3 – a 4 loop ( Figures 1L , S1B , and S6B ) . Thr165 is not directly involved in the dimer - dimer interac - tions in the ﬁlament in the crystals ( Figures 1L and S6B ) . However , it contributes to the turn conformation by hydro - gen bonding with the main - chain imino group of Asp168 . These intensive interactions seem to stabilize the ﬁlamen - tous structure of the EFC - domain dimers in the crystals ( Figure 4A ) . Interestingly , ﬁlament formation by the FBP17 EFC domain was observed by electron micros - copy in the absence of liposomes ( Itoh et al . , 2005 ) . The length of the EFC dimer in the ﬁlament in the crystals cor - responds well to that of one unit of the periodic structure in the EFC ﬁlament , observed by negative staining EM ( Itoh et al . , 2005 ) . The EFC D N CIP4 crystals grew in the puriﬁca - tion buffer without any precipitant , indicating that the ﬁla - ment in the crystals is similar to that formed under some solution conditions . The replacement of Lys166 with Ala reduced both the membrane - binding and tubulation activities of EFC FBP17 ( Figures 1L , 2A – 2C , and 4B ) . Moreover , the T165A and K166Amutationsbothabolishedtheinductionofmembrane invagination by FBP17 in cells ( Figures 1L and 2D ) . These Figure 4 .

The EFC ﬁlament adopts a straight , periodic conforma - tion in the crystals , and the observed dimer - dimer inter - faces of the EFC ﬁlament seem to be ﬂexible and to form a hinge in the ﬁlament ( Figures 4A – 4C ) . When the EFC ﬁlament bends at the hinges , the overall shape of the ﬁlament becomes round ( Figures 4D , S6C , and S6D ) . Finally , a ring or spiral is formed ( Figures 4E and 4F ) , which may wind around the nascent tubular membrane to sup - port the tubular shape , with the concave dimer surfaces facing the tubular membrane ( Figure 4G ) . When the EFC spiral winds around the tubular membrane several times , lateral interactions between the neighboring ﬁlaments may be formed . The shapes of the EFC ﬁlaments are quite complementary , and the tight spiral can cover the tubular membrane with minimal uncovered areas and with no se - vere clashes ( Figure 4H ) . Helix a 1 is one of the structural elements that directly support the lateral interface resi - dues ( Figure 4H ) . Interestingly , EFC D N FBP17 , which lacks the N - terminal nine residues including helix a 1 , showed a reduced tubulation activity , while its membrane - binding activity was not affected ( Figures 2A – 2C ) . Since the EFC domain is assumed to bind most tightly to the properly curved membrane , the EFC dimers may accumulate at the foot of the nascent tubular membrane and join the pre - formed EFC ﬁlament to drive continuous membrane tubu - lation ( Figure 4I ) . Tubular Membrane Striation with the EFC Filaments Phase - contrast cryo - TEM with a Zernike phase plate allows the observation of biological specimens with high contrast ( Danev and Nagayama , 2001 ) , without any stain - ing ( Nagayama , 2005 ) . Among the tubular membranes observed by the phase - contrast cryo - TEM , we certainly found those with striated structures , which probably rep - resent the tight EFC spirals covering the tubular mem - branes ( Figures 5A – 5C ) . The striations seemed to be nearly perpendicular to the main axis of the tubular mem - brane , and the average spacing between neighboring stri - ations in Figure 5C was (cid:2) 41 A˚ , where the regularly spaced striations gave rise to diffraction peaks in the Fourier im - age , as shown in Figure 5D . The spacing of the striations ranges from 40 A˚ to 50 A˚ ( Figures 5A – 5C ) , and the mini - mum striation pitch agrees fairly well with the width of the thickest part of the EFC ﬁlament in the crystals ( (cid:2) 35 A˚ ) . These properties correspond quite well to our model of membrane tubulation ( Figure 4I ) . The diameters of the EFC - induced tubular membranes observed by the negative staining EM range from 600 to 2000 A˚ or 400 to 2000 A˚ ( Figure S5 and Itoh et al . , 2005 ) . On the other hand , those observed by the phase - contrast cryo - TEM range from 650 A ˚ to 3300 A ˚ . The maximum di - ameter of the tubular membrane may be larger because the EFC ﬁlaments were also observed on round liposomes with larger diameters ( > 1 m m ; data not shown ) . These ob - servations suggest that the EFC domain binds to lipo - somes with various diameters and constrains them into tu - bules with diameters of 650 A˚ or larger ( Figures 5A – 5C ) . Note that the minimum diameter of the observed tubular membranes is close to that of the tubular membrane that ﬁts the concave surface of the EFC domain ( (cid:2) 600 A˚ ) . We also observed a snapshot of a possible inter - mediate state of membrane tubulation in which the EFC - coated tubular membrane protrudes from a parental lipo - some ( Figure 5A ) . FBP17 Is Recruited to CCPs in the Late Stage of CME Knockdown experiments implicated FBP17 in the recep - tor - mediated endocytosis of cholera toxin subunit B ( CTB ) , epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) , and transferrin ( Ka - mioka et al . , 2004 ; Itoh et al . , 2005 ; Tsujita et al . , 2006 ) . Consistent with this , CTB , EGF , and transferrin colocal - ized with the FBP17 - induced tubular membranes ( Ka - mioka et al . , 2004 ; Tsujita et al . , 2006 ) . Thus , FBP17 is in - volved in both clathrin - dependent and - independent endocytosis . CIP4 and Toca - 1 are also implicated in CME ( Itoh et al . , 2005 ; Tsujita et al . , 2006 ) .

Actin and N - WASP were reportedly transiently recruited to CCPs in the late stage of CME ( Perrais and Merriﬁeld , 2005 ; Merriﬁeld et al . , 2004 ; Yarar et al . , 2005 ; Figures 6A and 6B ) . FBP17 was also recruited to CCPs for a time period very similar to that of N - WASP , when clathrin departed from the plasma membrane ( Figures 6B – 6D ) . DISCUSSION We have shown that FBP17 was transiently recruited to CCPs in the late stage of CME , and that its retention time roughly corresponds to those of actin and N - WASP ( Figures 6A – 6D ) . Based on these and other data , we pro - pose the following hypothetical model for the role of FBP17 and other FCRP proteins in CME . Clathrin coats that can accommodate a transport vesicle form a variety of structures with various diameters larger than (cid:2) 700 A˚ ( Fotin et al . , 2004 ) . Interestingly , the EFC domain is selec - tive for liposomes larger than 1000 A ˚ in diameter , and it generates tubular membranes with diameters larger than 650 A ˚ . Hence , it is possible that the EFC domain of the FCRP proteins senses the lower curvature at the foot of hemispherical CCPs and accumulates at the beginning of the invagination step ( Figure 7 ) . Subsequent self - oligo - merization of the EFC domain may drive CCP invagination ( Figure 7 ) . Finally , the FCRP proteins may recruit dynamins with the SH3 domain , to further narrow the diameter of the invaginated tube to (cid:2) 200 A˚ ( nonconstricted state ) and to (cid:2) 100 A˚ ( constricted state ) for scission to take place ( Figure 7 ; Chen et al . , 2004 ) . The FCRP proteins may also activate the actin nucleation machinery , such as N - WASP , at the foot of the CCP , and this machinery may cooperate with dynamins to regulate endocytic vesi - cle scission ( Merriﬁeld et al . , 2005 ; Itoh et al . , 2005 ; Tsujita et al . , 2006 ) . Thus , the FCRP proteins may link clathrin - mediatedbudding todynamin - dependentscission through their interaction with the membrane by the EFC domain in CME . We observed that FBP17 was colocalized with CCPs ( Figure 6 ) . This result supports our model in which the FCRP proteins are recruited to CCPs in the invagination step after the clathrin assembly . Since the BAR domain binds and deforms smaller liposomes than those pre - ferred by the EFC domain ( Figure 3 ) , the BAR - domain pro - teins may be recruited to CCPs for a shorter time period after the recruitment of the EFC - domain proteins , i . e . , just before or during the scission step . Thus , although they share similar dimeric architectures , the PCH proteins and the BAR - domain proteins may function at distinct steps in endocytic vesicle formation due to the differences in their overall structures .

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Initial Expression Trials Twenty - six DNAconstructs , encoding humanCIP4 fragments withdif - ferent N - and C - terminal boundaries , were ampliﬁed from the human full - length cDNA clone , with the NCBI protein database code gi : 62897779 . The ampliﬁed cDNA fragment was attached by overlap PCR to the T7 promoter sequence , the ribosome - binding site , the His - tag , the cleavage site for tobacco etch virus ( TEV ) protease , and the T7 terminator sequence ( Horton et al . , 1989 ) . The fusion proteins were synthesized by the dialysis mode of the cell - free protein expression system using PCR DNA templates , as de - scribed ( Kigawaetal . , 1999 , 2004 ; Sitaramanetal . , 2004 ) . Thetotalre - actionmixtureswerecentrifugedtoremovetheinsolubleproteins , and the total and soluble fractions were subjected to SDS - PAGE to assess the quantity and the solubility of the expressed proteins . Protein Preparations The selenomethionine ( SeMet ) - substituted EFC D N CIP4 was synthe - sized in the cell - free system as a His - tagged protein with a TEV prote - asesite .

TheproteinranasasinglebandonanSDS - PAGEgelandwasconcen - trated to approximately 3 . 8 mg / ml , using an Amicon Ultra - 15 centrifu - gal concentrator ( Millipore ) , prior to crystallization . The SeMet - substituted human EFC FBP17 was expressed as a GST - fusion protein in E . coli B834 ( DE3 ) ( Novagen ) . The GST - fusion protein was puriﬁed with Glutathione Sepharose HP , eluted by reduced gluta - thione , cleavedbyPreScissionprotease , andfurtherpuriﬁedbyanion - exchange and gel - ﬁltration chromatography . The protein ran as a sin - glebandonanSDS - PAGEgelandwasconcentratedtoapproximately 0 . 8 – 1 . 0 mg / ml in the same manner as for EFC D N CIP4 . EFC FBP17 mutants were prepared in a similar manner to that for EFC FBP17 . Point mutationswereintroducedbytheQuickChangeprotocol ( Stratagene ) .

A MAD data set was collected at the Southeast Regional Collab - orative Access Team ( SER - CAT ) 22 - ID beamline at the Advanced Photon Source , Argonne National Laboratory ( Table 1 ) . A high - resolu - tion data set was collected at the RIKEN Structural Genomics Beam - line I ( BL26B1 ) at SPring - 8 ( Table 1 ) . Data were processed with the HKL2000 program package ( Otwinowski and Minor , 1997 ) . Initial phases were obtained with the MAD data set , and a readily interpret - able electron density map was calculated after density modiﬁcation using the program CNS ( Brunger et al . , 1998 ) . The initial model was built with the program O ( Jones et al . , 1991 ) . The model was reﬁned with the program CNS against the high - resolution data set . Iterative rounds of reﬁnement and model rebuilding improved the quality of the simulated - annealing omit electron density maps , allowing us to build additional residues in the model . The ﬁnal model has an R work of 22 . 8 % and an R free of 27 . 9 % at 2 . 3 A˚ resolution . The EFC FBP17 crystals were grown at 20 (cid:3) C , using the hanging - drop vapor - diffusion method , against 50 mM MES - NaOH buffer ( pH 6 . 0 ) containing 20 mM MgCl 2 and 15 % isopropanol . The crystals belong to the space group C2 , with unit - cell dimensions of a = 201 . 0 A˚ , b = 41 . 4 A˚ , c = 56 . 5 A˚ , and b = 105 . 1 (cid:3) . The crystals were transferred to a reservoir solution containing 25 % glycerol as a cryoprotectant and were ﬂash - cooled in liquid nitrogen . A native data set was collected at BL26B1 at SPring - 8 ( Table 1 ) . The data were processed with the HKL2000 program package . The structure of EFC FBP17 was deter - mined by the molecular replacement method , using the structure of EFC D N CIP4 as a search model , with the program CNS . The model building was completed in a similar manner to that for EFC D N CIP4 with the programs CNS and O . The ﬁnal model has an R work of 21 . 2 % and an R free of 26 . 7 % at 2 . 6 A˚ resolution .
