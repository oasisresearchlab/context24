RESEARCH ARTICLE Open Access Disruption of zebrafish cyclin G - associated kinase ( GAK ) function impairs the expression of Notch - dependent genes during neurogenesis and causes defects in neuronal development Ting Bai † , Jamie L Seebald † , Kyu - Eui Kim , Hong - Mei Ding , Daniel P Szeto * , Henry C Chang * Abstract Background : The J - domain - containing protein auxilin , a critical regulator in clathrin - mediated transport , has been implicated in Drosophila Notch signaling . To ask if this role of auxilin is conserved and whether auxilin has additional roles in development , we have investigated the functions of auxilin orthologs in zebrafish . Results : Like mammals , zebrafish has two distinct auxilin - like molecules , auxilin and cyclin G - a ssociated k inase ( GAK ) , differing in their domain structures and expression patterns . Both zebrafish auxilin and GAK can functionally substitute for the Drosophila auxilin , suggesting that they have overlapping molecular functions . Still , they are not completely redundant , as morpholino - mediated knockdown of the ubiquitously expressed GAK alone can increase the specification of neuronal cells , a known Notch - dependent process , and decrease the expression of Her4 , a Notch target gene . Furthermore , inhibition of GAK function caused an elevated level of apoptosis in neural tissues , resulting in severe degeneration of neural structures . Conclusion : In support of the notion that endocytosis plays important roles in Notch signaling , inhibition of zebrafish GAK function affects embryonic neuronal cell specification and Her4 expression . In addition , our analysis suggests that zebrafish GAK has at least two functions during the development of neural tissues : an early Notch - dependent role in neuronal patterning and a late role in maintaining the survival of neural cells . Background The conserved Notch pathway participates in diverse aspects of animal development , and has been implicated in human diseases and cancers [ 1 - 3 ] . Notch encodes a transmembrane receptor , which , upon ligand binding , undergoes proteolytic processing and releases an intra - cellular fragment capable of acting as a transcription co - regulator . As both Notch and its ligands ( also trans - membrane proteins ) are widely expressed , their activities need to be tightly regulated . One such important regula - tion appears to be ligand internalization , which plays a critical role in activating Notch receptors [ 4 , 5 ] . Notch ligand internalization utilizes an ubiquitin - dependent endocytic pathway , as two structurally unrelated E3 ubiquitin ligases , neuralized ( neur ) and mind bomb ( dMib ) , can append ubiquitin to DSL ( Delta , Serrate , Lag2 ) ligands [ 6 - 13 ] . Epsin / lqf ( liquid facets ) then recruits the ubiquitinated DSL ligands into cla - thrin - coated vesicles ( CCVs ) [ 14 - 18 ] . The scission of these ligand - containing CCVs from the plasma mem - brane seems critical for Notch activation , as disruption of dynamin function also causes a Notch - like defect [ 4 , 19 , 20 ] . Another relevant factor in Drosophila Notch ligand endocytosis is the J - domain protein auxilin [ 21 , 22 ] . First identified in mammals , auxilin is known to cooperate with Hsc70 in mediating the disassembly of clathrin tris - kelia and coat proteins from newly formed CCVs in vitro [ 23 ] . The mammalian genomes contain two dis - tinct auxilin - related genes : auxilin and GAK , differing in the presence of an Ark ( a ctin - r elated k inase ) family kinase domain and their tissue distributions [ 23 - 25 ] . * Correspondence : szetod @ purdue . edu ; hcchang @ purdue . edu † Contributed equally Department of Biological Sciences , Purdue University , 915 W .

GAK contains the Ark domain at the N - terminus and it is ubiquitously expressed . In contrast , auxilin lacks the kinase domain and its expression appears to be neuro - nal . However , the expression of auxilin in non - neuronal cells has recently been demonstrated [ 26 ] . Besides uncoating , several other functions during endocytosis have recently been suggested for auxilin family proteins , including facilitating clathrin exchange during coated - pit formation [ 27 , 28 ] , participating in pit constriction [ 29 ] and preventing precipitous assembly of clathrin cages [ 26 , 30 ] . Furthermore , GAK has been implicated in cla - thrin - mediated trafficking from the trans Golgi network ( TGN ) [ 25 , 31 ] . While it is unclear which of the aforementioned cellu - lar functions are most relevant under physiological con - ditions , mutations in the sole Drosophila auxilin ortholog ( dAux ) clearly disrupt several Notch - dependent processes [ 21 , 22 ] . One such process is the patterning of neural tissues , in which the cells destined to become neurons send a Notch - mediated signal to prevent neigh - boring cells from adopting neuronal fate . In the absence of this lateral inhibition , supernumerary neuronal cells are generated , forming the so - called neurogenic pheno - type [ 2 ] . Consistent with the notion that dAux partici - pates in Notch signaling , excessive neurons were seen in both the embryonic CNS and the larval eye discs of dAux mutants [ 21 , 32 ] . Mosaic analysis showed that the function of dAux during Notch signaling is required in the signal - sending cells , suggesting that it has a role in ligand internalization [ 32 , 33 ] . Given the high degree of conservation of the Notch pathway , it seems reasonable to expect an inhibition of auxilin function in other animal systems would cause Notch - like defects . However , as multiple distinct endocy - tic pathways exist in higher metazoans [ 34 ] , it is possible that different endocytic pathways can functionally sub - stitute for one another in Notch ligand endocytosis . Inhibition of auxilin function by RNA interference in C . elegans was shown to disrupt the receptor - mediated uptake of yolk proteins , yet no Notch - related defects were reported [ 35 ] . RNAi - mediated reduction of GAK function in mammalian cells appeared to deregulate EGF signaling and promote tumorigenesis [ 36 ] . Tissue - specific inactivation of mouse GAK during embryonic development caused severe degenerations in brain , liver , and skin [ 37 ] , but it is unclear whether any of these defects were due to a disruption of Notch function . Thus , while it seems clear that auxilin family proteins are important for animal viability , whether their func - tion in Notch ligand endocytosis is evolutionarily con - served requires additional investigations . We have used zebrafish to further assess the roles of auxilin - dependent endocytosis in animal development . Besides being a versatile model organism , zebrafish is suitable for our purpose because the importance of Notch ligand endocytosis has been demonstrated during embryonic neural patterning [ 9 ] . We show that zebra - fish , like mammals but unlike Drosophila , contains both auxilin and GAK . Zebrafish auxilin and GAK are inter - changeable in their abilities to substitute for dAux dur - ing Drosophila Notch signaling , suggesting that they share some cellular functions . However , they have differ - ent expression patterns during development , suggesting that these two paralogs are not completely redundant . Morpholino - mediated knockdown of GAK function dur - ing embryogenesis caused an increase in the formation of neuronal cells and a decrease in the expression of a Notch target gene , supporting our hypothesis that the role of auxilin family proteins in Notch signaling is con - served . Furthermore , we showed that embryos deficient in GAK function had a higher level of programmed cell death in neural tissues , suggesting that GAK is required for the survival of neuronal cells . Results The zebrafish genome contains both GAK and auxilin To examine the roles of auxilin - related genes during vertebrate development , we first sought to identify aux - ilin or GAK in zebrafish genome . Database search revealed that , like mammals , the zebrafish genome con - tains both GAK ( zGAK , XP _ 001919224 ) and auxilin ( zAux , XP _ 001336673 ) orthologs , located on chromo - some 23 and 6 respectively . This presence of two dis - tinct auxilin - related orthologs appears to be a feature shared by other vertebrates , as the chicken ( Gallus gal - lus , XP _ 424873 and XP _ 422527 ) and pufferfish ( Tetrao - don nigroviridis , CAG08624 and CAG11595 ) genomes both contain GAK and auxilin . In contrast , arthropods such as Drosophila ( melanogaster and virilis , XP _ 002058717 ) , honeybee ( Apis mellifera , XP _ 396906 ) and flour beetle ( Tribolium castaneum , XP _ 967193 ) have only GAK . C . elegans also has only one auxilin - related gene , but it lacks both the kinase and the PTEN homologous region [ 35 ] . The zGAK locus encodes a polypeptide of 1278 amino acids and , like other GAK orthologs , contains an N - term - inal Ark kinase , a PTEN domain , a CBM region and a C - terminal J domain ( Figure 1A ) . Alignment of protein sequences shows that zGAK is 65 % identical to human GAK overall , with the sequence conservations concen - trated in the kinase , PTEN and the J - domain . The kinase , PTEN and J - domain of zGAK are 82 . 4 % , 84 . 7 % , and 78 . 8 % identical to the corresponding domains of human GAK respectively . In contrast , the CBM domains of zGAK and human GAK are more divergent , sharing only 31 . 7 % amino acid sequence identity . The zAux protein , on the other hand , is an 873 amino acid long polypeptide , which contains a PTEN region , a Bai et al . BMC Developmental Biology 2010 , 10 : 7 http : / / www . biomedcentral . com / 1471 - 213X / 10 / 7 Page 2 of 17 CBM and a J - domain , but lacks the N - terminal kinase ( Figure 1B ) . The protein sequence of zAux is 59 . 3 % identical overall to the human auxilin . Again , the con - servations are higher in the PTEN and the J - domain , as these domains share 67 . 5 % and 94 . 5 % amino acid iden - tity respectively . These domains of zAux are also highly related to the PTEN and the J - domain of zGAK ( 50 . 8 % and 89 . 4 % protein sequence identity respectively ) , sug - gesting that zAux and zGAK are derived from a com - mon ancestral gene . However , while zAux is similar to zGAK , it is more similar to human and mouse auxilin proteins ( Figure 2A ) , suggesting that the divergence of GAK and auxilin occurred prior to the divergence of fish and mammals during vertebrate evolution . In addition to the similarities in protein sequences , the intron / exon organizations among auxilin family genes are highly conserved . First , the human , mouse , and zeb - rafish GAK loci all contain an identical number ( 27 ) of introns . The zAux locus appears to have lost one intron in the CBM during evolution , as it contains 16 introns Figure 1 The genomic organizations and the protein sequences of zebrafish GAK and auxilin . ( A ) The zGAK locus contains 28 exons and spans 78 kb of genomic DNA . The corresponding cDNA contains a 3834 bp ORF , encoding a polypeptide of 1278 amino acids with an Ark kinase domain ( blue ) , a PTEN - homologous region ( orange ) , a clathrin - binding motif ( CBM ) , and a J - domain ( green ) . Two morpholinos , GAK - MO1 and GAK - MO2 , ( red boxes ) were designed to disrupt the splicing of zGAK mRNA by blocking the splice acceptors of exon3 and exon19 , respectively . The amino acids deleted by GAK - MO1 injection are boxed in red . The premature stop codon ( after Lys679 ) generated by GAK - MO2 injection is indicated by a red line . ( B ) The zAux locus is smaller , as it contains 17 exons and spans across 40 kb of genomic DNA . The zAux protein , encoded by a 2619 bp ORF , contains a PTEN - related region ( orange ) , CBM , and J - domain ( green ) .

BMC Developmental Biology 2010 , 10 : 7 http : / / www . biomedcentral . com / 1471 - 213X / 10 / 7 Page 4 of 17 while the human and mouse auxilins have 17 . Further - more , in the conserved domains , the positions and the phases ( 0 , 1 , or 2 in the codons ) of these introns can be precisely aligned . For example , the PTEN homologous regions of zebrafish , mouse , and human GAK and aux - ilin loci all contain 8 introns ( Figure 2B ) . These introns , although different in nucleotide lengths , are located at the same positions in the coding region with identical phases . This high degree of conservation in intron / exon organization strongly bolsters the notion that GAK and auxilin were derived from a common ancestral gene through gene duplication . Overexpression of zGAK or zAux causes clathrin aggregations To ask if zebrafish auxilin family proteins have similar cellular functions as their respective mammalian coun - terparts , we determined the subcellular localizations of zGAK and zAux . Both zGAK and zAux were tagged with GFP at the N - termini , placed under the control of a CMV promoter in pCS2 , and transiently expressed in HeLa cells . These GFP - tagged fusion proteins are func - tional , as ectopic expression of either GFP - zGAK or GFP - zAux in Drosophila could restore the neurogenic defect and the lethality caused by dAux mutations ( see below ) . To reveal clathrin - positive structures , these cells were also stained with a mouse monoclonal antibody against clathrin heavy chain . As shown in Figure 3 , qualitatively different GFP pat - terns were seen in pCS2 - GFP - zAux and pCS2 - GFP - zGAK transfected cells , depending on the expression levels . In cells expressing low levels of GFP - zGAK or GFP - zAux ( marked by asterisks ) , GFP signals were mostly cytosolic and slightly enriched near the perinuc - lear regions . These perinuclear zGAK - and zAux - posi - tive structures showed overlaps with clathrin , most likely representing the TGN . In cells expressing high levels of GFP - zGAK and GFP - zAux , the cytosolic staining and the enrichments near the perinuclear regions could still be seen . How - ever , these cells also contained large GFP - positive aggregates ( indicated by solid arrows and arrowheads ) that were intensely clathrin - positive . In untransfected cells , clathrin staining had a vesicular appearance throughout the cytosol , but it appeared depleted from these structures in those aggregate - containing cells . We noticed that zGAK seemed more capable of caus - ing these aggregates than zAux , as intense GFP - positive and clathrin - containing structures were readily seen in cells expressing milder levels of GFP - zGAK . It has been shown that endogenous GAK is predominantly cytosolic and shows elevated associations with TGN [ 24 , 25 , 31 ] , and over - expression of mammalian auxilin family proteins in HeLa cells can cause the formation of clathrin - containing “ granules ” [ 24 , 38 ] . Thus , our results showed that over - expressed zGAK and zAux are localized similarly within the cells . In addition , their localizations are similar to those of their respec - tive mammalian homologs . Figure 3 The subcellular distributions of zebrafish auxilin family proteins .

N - terminally GFP - tagged zGAK and zAux were placed under UAS control , and transgenic flies carrying these constructs were generated . We reasoned that if zGAK and zAux function similarly during clathrin - mediated transport , both should be able to supplant dAux function during neuronal differentiation in Drosophila eye discs and for animal survival . In wild - type eye discs , regular arrays of photoreceptor clusters could be revealed with a Elav antibody , which labels the nuclei of neuronal cells [ 39 ] . In contrast , excessive and disorganized Elav - positive cells were seen in dAux F956X mutant tissues ( Figure 4A ) [ 33 ] . This defect of extra Elav - positive cells could be rescued by an Act5C - GAL4 - driven expression of the full - length dAux ( Figure 4B ) [ 33 ] . Similar to dAux , both UAS - GFP - zGAK and UAS - GFP - zAux , when driven by Act5C - GAL4 , could Figure 4 Both zGAK and zAux can substitute for Drosophila auxilin .

We have previously shown that the lethality of dAux mutants could be res - cued by a ubiquitous expression of full - length dAux [ 33 ] . Similarly , Act5C - GAL4 - driven GFP - zGAK and GFP - zAux could both restore the viability of dAux mutant flies . These results suggest that zGAK and zAux can both functionally substitute for dAux . Deletion of the J - domain from Drosophila auxilin is known to render them non - functional [ 32 , 33 ] . To ask whether the J - domain is essential for both zAux and zGAK to rescue dAux , UAS - GFP - zGAK DelJ and UAS - GFP - zAux DelJ were generated . Unlike their full - length counter parts , these J - deletions failed to rescue the extra Elav - positive cell phenotype ( Figure 4E & 4F ) and the lethality , suggesting that , like dAux , the J - domain is cri - tical for the functions of these auxilin family proteins . zGAK and zAux are differentially expressed during embryonic development Although it is known that mammalian GAK and auxilin are expressed in different tissues [ 24 ] , their temporal and spatial expressions during development have not been fully investigated . To better understand the requirement of zGAK and zAux , we examined their expression at various stages of zebrafish development using whole - mount in situ hybridization . Zygotic expres - sions of zGAK and zAux , which were also maternally expressed ( data not shown ) , were detected in diverse tis - sues , but were most prominently associated with neural tissues . Between 8 - to 15 - somite stages , zGAK was broadly expressed in the dorsal region of the embryo , and the expression of zAux appeared to be restricted to the bilateral cell clusters on the dorsal side of the embryo ( Figure 5A - F ) . As a control , hybridization using sense probes did not yield detectable signals ( data not shown ) . At the 19 - somite stage , zGAK still expressed broadly in the entire embryo , whereas zAux was predo - minantly found in hindbrain neurons , spinal chord neu - rons , and otic vesicles ( Figure 5G and 5H ) . At 24 - hour post fertilization ( hpf ) , zGAK was enriched in brains , eyes , otic vesicles , and vasculature , and zAux expression was detected in hindbrain neurons , spinal chord neu - rons , otic vesicles and posterior otic capsules ( Figure 5I - N ) . The fact that the expression patterns of zGAK and zAux did not coincide completely suggests that they have overlapping and distinct functions during development . Inhibiting zGAK function causes neural - specific cell degeneration Because of the structural conservation of the GAK genes from Drosophila to human , we decided to focus on zGAK function during embryonic development . To inhi - bit zGAK , we designed an antisense morpholino oligo - nucleotide ( GAK - MO1 ) to disrupt the normal splicing of zGAK mRNA ( Figure 6A ) . A control antisense mor - pholino oligonucleotide ( GAK - MO1C ) , which is a modi - fied sequence of GAK - MO1 with five nucleotide changes , was also included . Embryos injected with 8 . 0ng of GAK - MO1 at one - cell stage ( hereafter referred as GAK - MO1 morphants ) consistently had smaller eyes , enlarged hindbrain , thinner yolk extension , and weak circulation at 36 to 48 hpf ( 85 % , n = 100 , see below ) . In contrast , injection of the same or higher amount of GAK - MO1C caused no developmental defects in embryos ( 100 % , n = 100 ) . To ensure that the splicing on zGAK mRNA was disrupted , RNAs isolated from GAK - MO1 morphants at 6 hpf were analyzed by RT - PCR . As shown in Figure 6A , the injection of GAK - MO1 resulted in a transcript lacking exon 3 , generating an in - frame deletion in the kinase domain ( Figure 1A ) . Morphologically , the development of GAK - MO1 mor - phants appeared normal until the segmentation stage . At the 10 - somite stage , GAK - MO1 morphants displayed cell degeneration in the eyes , which became noticeably opaque ( data not shown ) . At the 14 - somite stage , degen - erating cells persisted in the eyes , began to appear in the hypothalamic and thalamic regions of the brain and the hindbrain ( Figure 7E and 7F ) , and continued to increase for the remaining duration of somitogenesis . In contrast , these same regions of the uninjected embryos were transparent ( Figure 7A and 7B ) . In some cases , the degeneration had spread to the developing neural tube of GAK - MO1 morphants . It is noteworthy that cell degeneration was only observed in neuroectodermal tis - sues , but not in non - neural tissues such as the noto - chord and somites . From 24 to 28 hpf , thinner yolk extension and weak blood circulation were observed in GAK - MO1 morphants , as compared to the uninjected embryos at the same stages ( Figure 7C , D , G , and 7H ) . At 36 hpf , the hindbrain and the tectal ventricles of GAK - MO1 morphants were enlarged ( Figure 7I - L ) , although these embryos still retained the ability to respond to touch ( data not shown ) . To ensure that these phenotypes were caused by the disruption of zGAK , we tested the binding specificity of GAK - MO1 . The complimentary target sequence of GAK - MO1 was placed in front of the mCherry reporter gene [ 40 ] , and the resulting fusion ( GAK - MO1 - mCherry ) was cloned into pCS2 ( Figure 6C ) . Similarly , the compli - mentary sequence for GAK - MO1C was placed in front of mCherry and cloned into pCS2 as a control . Using these constructs , GAK - MO1 - mCherry and GAK - MO1C - mCherry RNAs were transcribed in vitro and injected along with either GAK - MO1 or GAK - MO1C morpholi - nos into one - cell stage embryos . Injected embryos at 6 hpf were then analyzed for the protein expression of mCherry . As shown in Figure 6B , GAK - MO1 , but not GAK - MO1C , was capable of blocking the translation of Bai et al . BMC Developmental Biology 2010 , 10 : 7 http : / / www . biomedcentral . com / 1471 - 213X / 10 / 7 Page 7 of 17 GAK - MO1 - mCherry . Conversely , GAK - MO1 had no effect on the expression of GAK - MO1C - mCherry . These results demonstrate a high degree of binding spe - cificity and efficacy of GAK - MO1 to its intended target . To further show that the phenotypes of GAK - MO1 morphants were not due to off - target effects , a second morpholino antisense oligonucleotide ( GAK - MO2 ) was designed to block splicing at a different region of the GAK gene ( Figure 1A ) . RT - PCR analysis showed that injection of GAK - MO2 caused the retention of intron 19 , resulting in a premature stop codon in the PTEN domain in the zGAK transcripts ( Figure 1A and Addi - tional file 1 : Figure S1A ) . Embryos injected with 6 . 0ng of GAK - MO2 exhibited the same phenotypes as those observed with GAK - MO1 morphants ( 90 % , n = 85 ; Addi - tional file 1 : Figure S1B and C ) .

( A ) RT - PCR analysis of total RNA extracted from uninjected and GAK - MO1 morphant embryos . From normally spliced zGAK mRNA , a reaction with primers complementary to exon 2 and 4 ( 2 / 4 ) would yield a band of 178 bp , and a reaction with primers complementary to exon 18 and 20 ( 18 / 20 ) would yield a band of 275 bp . While the 275 bp band seemed unaffected by GAK - MO1 injection , the level of 178 bp band was reduced and a new band of 118 bp appeared in GAK morphants . Sequence analysis of this 118 bp band showed that exon 2 was spliced into exon 4 , resulting in an in - frame deletion in the kinase domain .

Disrupting zGAK function causes excessive neural - specific programmed cell death To further define the extent and understand the cause of the cell degeneration in GAK morphants , we per - formed in situ TUNEL assay to detect apoptotic cells . At the 14 - somite stage , a slight increase in apoptotic cell death was observed in the brain regions of GAK morphants , as compared to the control embryos ( Figure 8A - D ) . At 24 hpf , GAK morphants displayed a signifi - cantly higher level of cell death in the brain , as well as in the neural tube ( Figure 8E - H ) . Similar to the afore - mentioned cell degeneration , excessive apoptosis in GAK morphants was seen only in neural tissues , but not in non - neural tissues . Thus , there appears to be a good correlation in the onset and the extent of these two phe - notypes , suggesting that this increase in the pro - grammed cell death is the basis for the cell degeneration in GAK morphants . Reduction of zGAK disrupts the development of specific brain regions To explore the role of zGAK in brain patterning , GAK morphants were stained for krox20 , fibroblast growth factor 8 ( fgf8 ) and sonic hedgehog ( shh ) , whose expres - sions delineate various regions of the brain . Krox20 , a zinc finger - containing transcription factor , is expressed specifically in the hindbrain [ 41 ] . At the 12 - somite stage , the pattern and the level of krox20 expression Figure 8 Programmed cell death in wild - type and GAK morphant embryos during development .

However , as compared to the control wild - type embryo , no obvious increase in apoptosis was observed in the posterior region of GAK morphants ( indicated by arrows ) .

At 24 hpf , the pattern of krox20 expression in GAK morphants remained similar to that seen in wild type , although the two stripes of krox20 in the rhombomeres 3 and 5 appeared much closer ( Figure 9C and 9D ) . This suggests that , while the overall patterning of the brain regions is not significantly affected , the rostral hindbrain is reduced in size in the absence of zGAK function . Fgf8 , expressed in the forebrain , the MHB ( midbrain - hindbrain boundary ) and other mesodermal derivatives that include somites and tailbud , has been shown to reg - ulate forebrain development and establish the segmental identity of the hindbrain [ 42 ] . At the 12 - somite stage , the expression of fgf8 in GAK morphants appeared to be normal ( data not shown ) . In contrast , GAK mor - phants at the 18 - somite stage exhibited higher levels of fgf8 expression in the MHB , optic stalks and forebrain , suggestive of a requirement for GAK in repressing fgf8 expression in these regions ( Figure 9E - H ) . No alteration in fgf8 expression in the somites and tailbud regions was observed ( Figure 9E and 9F ) , consistent with the notion that zGAK function is required predominantly in neural tissues , but not in non - neural tissues . At the 18 - somite stage , shh mRNA was detected in the ventral midbrain , hypothalamus , telencephalon and notochord [ 43 ] . In contrast to fgf8 , shh expression appeared normal in the GAK morphants at this stage ( Figure 9I and 9J ) . Reduction of zGAK impairs Notch signaling To ask if zGAK , like dAux , has a role in Notch signal - ing , we examined the expression of HuC and Her4 mRNAs in GAK morphants . HuC , the zebrafish homo - log of Elav , is one of the earliest markers for neuronal cells [ 44 ] . In 8 - somite stage wild - type embryos , HuC transcripts are detected in bilateral stripes of neuronal cells along the anterior - posterior axis [ 45 ] . In GAK mor - phants at similar stage , although the pattern of expres - sion was similar , more HuC - positive cells were seen ( Figure 10A and 10B ) , suggesting that additional cells had adopted neuronal fate . This increase in HuC stain - ing persisted in GAK morphant embryos at 10 - somite stage ( Additional file 2 : Figure S2A - D ) . Interestingly , by 24 hpf , GAK morphants appeared to have fewer HuC - positive cells in the forebrain and midbrain regions ( Fig - ure 10C - F ) . However , it is important to note that the reduction in HuC - positive cells at this stage coincides with the onset of the elevated cell death in neural tis - sues ( see above ) . Her4 , a homolog of Drosophila E ( spl ) ( Enhancer of split ) gene , is a known target of the Notch pathway and parti - cipates in specification of neuronal cells [ 46 ] . In 8 - somite stage wild - type embryos , Her4 is expressed in bilateral stripes of cells [ 46 ] . Compared to wild type , the level of Her4 expression in GAK morphants appeared lower ( Figure 10G and 10H ) , suggesting that the output of the Notch pathway was reduced at this stage . Similar to HuC , this decrease in Her4 expression was still observed in 10 - somite stage GAK morphant embryos ( Additional file 2 : Figure S2E - H ) . At 24 hpf , Her4 expression in GAK morphants and control embryos was not significantly different ( Figure 10I and 10J ) , suggest - ing that either GAK is not required for Notch signaling , or GAK and auxilin are redundant for Notch signaling at this stage . Nevertheless , the alterations in the expres - sion of HuC and Her4 at the 8 - and 10 - somite stages showed that a reduction of GAK function could impair Notch activity in zebrafish . Discussion Zebrafish , like mammals but not invertebrates , has two distinct auxilin - related genes . Like their mammalian counterparts , zebrafish GAK and auxilin differ in the presence of the N - terminal kinase and their respective expression patterns . zGAK has a kinase domain and is ubiquitously expressed during embryonic development . In contrast , the expression of zAux , the ortholog with - out the kinase domain , appears predominantly in the neuronal cells . There are other differences between the two at the protein sequence level . For instance , zGAK , but not zAux , contains a sequence of FGDL at the amino acid position 950 , which matches perfectly to the consensus ψ G [ PDE ] [ ψ LM ] ( ψ is an aromatic residue ) . This motif , conserved in mammalian GAKs , has been shown to mediate interactions with AP1 adaptor in Golgi - lysosomal trafficking [ 31 ] . Taken together , these structural differences between GAK and auxilin suggest that their molecular functions may have diverged during evolution . It is notable that inhibiting zGAK function causes an increase in apoptotic cell death in the neu - roectodermal tissues , where GAK and auxilin are both expressed . This inability of zAux to compensate for the zGAK knockdown would argue that GAK has a function unique from auxilin . However , we cannot formally exclude the possibility that these neural cells may have a higher demand for the functions of auxilin - related genes . In this scenario , the functions of both genes would be needed to prevent the onset of apoptosis ; therefore , inhibiting GAK alone would be sufficient to induce extra neural cell deaths . Despite the structural differences between GAK and auxilin , it seems clear that these two paralogs have over - lapping molecular functions . Both GAK and auxilin are required for receptor - mediated endocytosis in HeLa cells , indicating that they act in the same process [ 26 ] . Consistent with this , we showed that the subcellular localizations of zGAK or zAux in HeLa cells were simi - lar , and over - expression of either in HeLa cells could form clathrin - containing aggregates . More importantly , we showed that over - expression of either zGAK or Bai et al .

Together , these results suggest that zGAK and zAux are at least partially redundant . Unlike zGAK or dAux , zAux does not have the N - terminal Ark kinase . Nevertheless , over - expression of zAux in Drosophila could completely restore the defects caused by a strong dAux allele . This is not entirely sur - prising as we have previous shown that over - expression of dAux Δ K , a dAux with its kinase domain deleted , could rescue the dAux phenotype [ 33 ] . In fact , over - expression of a fragment consisting of the CBM and J domains alone appears sufficient to restore the function of dAux in Notch [ 32 , 33 ] . However , the kinase domain does have a role in GAK ’ s function in Notch as kinase domain - specific disruptions , by either point mutations [ 33 ] or morpholino - induced mis - splicing ( MO1 , this study ) , produce Notch - like phenotypes . Still , it does appear that , when expressed at a high level , the kinase activity is not required for the functions of auxilin family proteins . In Drosophila , auxilin has been shown to participate in Notch signaling by facilitating ligand internalization [ 21 , 22 ] . Given that mammals and vertebrates have two auxilin - related genes , it is not known if either , neither , or both function in the Notch pathway . The similarities in domain structures and expression patterns suggest that GAK is more likely to have a role in Notch . How - ever , while inactivation of GAK affects the formation of multiple tissues in mouse [ 37 ] , it was unclear whether these defects were caused by disrupted Notch signaling . Here we showed that , in GAK morphants , the number of HuC - positive cells appeared increased , a defect analo - gous to the neurogenic phenotype . Moreover , we showed that , in GAK morphants , the expression of Her4 , a known Notch target gene , was reduced . Thus , while it is not yet known whether zGAK participates in ligand internalization , these defects in HuC and Her4 expressions suggest that GAK function is also required for Notch signaling in zebrafish . These results provide the first evidence that the requirement for a GAK - dependent endocytic pathway during Notch signaling is evolutionarily conserved . A requirement of the mind - bomb E3 ligase and epsin in Notch has also been demonstrated in flies [ 7 , 11 , 12 , 15 , 16 ] , fish [ 9 ] , and mouse [ 8 , 47 , 48 ] , which , along with our analysis of zebrafish GAK , suggests that Notch ligand internalization may rely on the same set of endocytic genes . It has been demonstrated that a conditional removal of GAK function during mouse brain development causes a significant loss of neural tissues [ 37 ] , although the mechanism is not known . Likewise , our depletion of GAK function during zebrafish embryonic development results in neural - specific cell degeneration . Using TUNEL staining , we showed that this cell degeneration is caused by increased programmed cell death , suggesting that GAK has a role in preventing the apoptosis of neural cells . Thus , although more HuC - positive cells were pre - sent in zGAK - deficient embryos at the 8 - and 10 - somite stages , fewer HuC - positive cells might be expected at later stages because of cell death . Indeed , this was pre - cisely what we observed , as fewer HuC - positive cells were seen in GAK morphants at 24 hpf . Interestingly , in mind - bomb mutant embryos , where Notch ligand endocytosis is impaired , no cell degeneration phenotype was observed ( J . S . , unpublished data ) . This , along with our observation that Her4 expression was not significantly reduced at 24 hpf , suggests that the role of GAK in maintaining neural cell survival may be Notch - independent . Taken together , our results suggest that GAK has at least two distinct functions during the development of neural tissues : an early role in the patterning of neuronal cells and a later role in maintaining the survival of neuronal cells . Furthermore , human GAK has recently been implicated as a susceptibility gene in familial Parkinson disease [ 49 ] , and the neurodegenerative phenotype observed in GAK morphants certainly supports this conclusion . It is noteworthy that the phenotypes of the GAK mor - phants bear a strong resemblance to those of the “ space - head ” class zebrafish mutants [ 50 ] . These mutants , isolated from a large - scale screen , are characterized by defects including cell degeneration in the eye and the brain regions , thinner yolk tube , and weak blood circula - tion [ 50 ] . As the genes responsible for most of these mutants have not been determined , the phenotypic simi - larities suggest that zGAK may correspond to one of them . If this is indeed the case , it will provide important clues to understand the functions of these genes in maintaining neuronal cell survival . Conclusion Zebrafish , like mammals but not invertebrates , has two distinct auxilin - related genes , auxilin and GAK . These two genes share some molecular functions , but are not completely redundant , as they are differentially expressed during development . Inhibition of GAK function appears to impair Notch signaling during embryonic neural pat - terning . This , along with the fact that auxilin has been implicated in Drosophila Notch signaling , suggests that the Notch pathway is regulated by a similar set of endo - cytic factors . In addition , we showed that inhibition of GAK function increases apoptosis in neural tissues , sug - gesting that GAK has a role in promoting or maintaining the survival of neural cells . As GAK is recently implicated in familial Parkinson disease [ 49 ] , our results should pro - vide a useful model for further understanding the cause of this neurodegenerative disease . Bai et al .

Adult fish and embryos were raised and main - tained at 28 . 5°C in system water . Embryos were obtained by natural spawning of adult AB strain zebrafish . zGAK - specific antisense morpholino oligonucleotides ( GAK - MO1 , GAK - MO2 , GAK - MO1C , and GAK - MO2C ) were purchased from Gene Tools ( Philomath , Oregon ) . At the one - cell stage , each embryo was injected with approxi - mately 1 nl volume of morpholino using a Picospritzer III ( Parker Hannifin ) . Embryos were collected at the appro - priate stages [ 51 ] and fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde in phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) overnight at 4°C . Fixed embryos were dechorionated , washed 3 times with PBS , and stored in methanol at - 20°C . Drosophila genetics Flies were raised at 25°C on standard food . Mutant clones of dAux F956X , a strong allele with a nonsense mutation deleting the J - domain , were generated as pre - viously described [ 33 ] . For the lethality assay , a trans - heterozygous combination of dAux F956X / dAux L78H was used to avoid potential unrelated lethal mutations in the background . The dAux L78H allele contains a missense mutation in the kinase domain [ 33 ] . Immunostaining of eye imaginal discs was performed as previously described [ 52 ] . Mouse a Elav 9F8A9 ( DSHB , Iowa ) was used at 1 : 100 . Molecular cloning A 4475 bps - long cDNA containing the entire zGAK ORF in pCCM114 was obtained from OpenBiosystems ( ID 2504096 ) . This particular clone has several muta - tions , including missense mutations at Arg 303 , Tyr 480 , Asp 614 , and a frameshift mutation at Gly 1047 . All were repaired using the QuickChange site - directed mutagen - esis kit ( Stratagene ) and the resulting cDNA was verified by sequencing . For zAux , an Exelixis EST ( ID 3410313 , OpenBiosystems ) containing a partial zAux ORF ( miss - ing the N - terminal 696 bps ) in pSPORT1 was obtained . A full - length cDNA clone was constructed using RT - PCR products from zebrafish embryonic mRNA and standard cloning techniques , and verified by sequencing . To generate pCS2 - GFP - zGAK and pCS2 - GFP - zAux , the entire zGAK and zAux ORFs were fused in frame to the C - terminus of EGFP , and the resulting fusions were cloned into pCS2 as EcoRI - XhoI fragments . To make zGAK Δ J and zAux Δ J , codons for His 1206 of zGAK and His 801 of zAux were changed into stops by site - directed mutagenesis . To express zGAK and zAux in Drosophila , GFP - tagged full - length or J - domain - deleted cDNAs were cloned into pUAST [ 53 ] . For RT - PCR analysis , total RNAs were extracted from embryos using RNeasy Mini Kit ( Qiagen ) and the RT - PCR reactions were performed using OneStep RT - PCR Kit ( Qiagen ) . Primers GTATGAGGCCCAGGATTTAG - GAAG and GTCAGACTCTTCTTTACTGATGGAC were used to examine the splicing at exon 3 . Primers GTGCCCAGAAATGCCTCCACTGTC and GCATAA - CAGGCTGTCGAACCAGGC were used to examine the splicing at exon 19 . HeLa cell manipulation and microscopy HeLa cells were maintained in DMEM , supplemented with 10 % Fetal Bovine Serum under standard conditions . To express GFP - zGAK or GFP - zAux , 70 % confluent HeLa cells in each 10cm dish were transfected with a 0 . 5ml cocktail , which contained 10 μ g plasmid DNA , 25 μ l of Fugene HD ( Roche ) and serum - free DMEM . Cells were harvested and processed for immunostaining 48 hours after transfection . Mouse a Chc ( Affinity BioRea - gents ) was used at 1 : 500 , and fluorescently - conjugated secondary antibodies ( Molecular Probes ) were used at 1 : 100 . All images were collected using Olympus BX61 equipped with a Spinning Disc Confocal unit and pro - cessed with Photoshop ( Adobe ) . In situ hybridization and TUNEL staining Whole - mount in situ hybridization was performed using digoxigenin - labeled antisense RNA probes and visua - lized using anti - digoxigenin Fab fragment conjugated with alkaline phosphatase ( Roche ) as previously described [ 54 ] . Riboprobes were made from DNA tem - plates , which were linearized and transcribed with either SP6 or T7 RNA polymerases . Embryos were processed and hybridized as previously described [ 54 ] . Whole - mount in situ TUNEL ( terminal deoxynucleotide transferase - mediated dUTP nick - end labeling ) was per - formed using the AP ( alkaline phosphatase ) In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit ( Roche ) as previously described [ 55 ] .

Using the RNA prepared from uninjected embryos , a 2 / 4 reaction ( using primers complementary to exon 2 and 4 ) yielded a band of 178 bp , and an 18 / 20 reaction yielded a band of 275 bp and a slightly smaller non - specific band . On the other hand , using the RNA prepared from GAK - MO2 morphants , the 178 bp band was unaffected . However , the 275 bp band was absent ( the non - specific band was unaffected ) and a new band of 359 bp appeared . Sequence analysis of this 359 bp band revealed that the injection of GAK - MO2 caused the retention of intron 18 , resulting in a frame - shift truncation in the PTEN region ( immediately after Lys 679 ) .
