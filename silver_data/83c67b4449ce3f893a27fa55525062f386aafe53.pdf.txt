Phosphorylation of Acanthamoeba Actophorin ( ADF / cofilin ) Blocks Interaction with Actin without a Change in Atomic Structure Laurent Blanchoin , Robert C . Robinson , Senyon Choe and Thomas D . Pollard * Structural Biology Laboratory The Salk Institute for Biological Studies , 10010 N . Torrey Pines Road , La Jolla , CA 92037 , USA LIM - kinase activated by GST - Pak1 phosphorylates Acanthamoeba acto - phorin stoichiometrically and speciﬁcally on serine 1 . The atomic struc - ture of phosphorylated actophorin determined by X - ray crystallography is essentially identical with the structure of unphosphorylated actophorin . We compared biochemical properties of phosphorylated actophorin , unphosphorylated actophorin and mutants of actophorin with serine 1 replaced by aspartic acid or alanine . Phosphorylation strongly inhibits interaction of actophorin with Mg - ADP - or Mg - ATP - actin monomers and Mg - ADP - actin ﬁlaments , so Ser1 phosphorylation directly blocks inter - action of actin - depolymerizing factor ( ADF ) / coﬁlin proteins with actin . About 30 % of actophorin is phosphorylated in live amoebas grown in suspension culture . Phosphorylation of ADF / coﬁlin proteins by LIM - kinase or other enzymes will tend to stabilize actin ﬁlaments by inhibit - ing the ability of these proteins to sever and depolymerize older actin ﬁlaments that have hydrolyzed their bound ATP and dissociated the phosphate . # 2000 Academic Press Keywords : actin ; actophorin ; LIM - kinase ; phosphorylation * Corresponding author Introduction In response to external stimuli many cell types , such as amoeba , ﬁbroblast or leukocyte , change shape and move on substrates or through the extracellular matrix . At the leading edge of these motile cells actin is organized in dense networks of dynamic ﬁlaments . Fresh actin polymerizes at the front of the cell to assure forward movement . At the same time actin ﬁlaments distant from the membrane depolymerize ( Wang , 1985 ; Theriot & Mitchison , 1991 ) . The balance between rapid poly - merization and depolymerization of actin deter - mines the size of this actin ﬁlament network . Considerable evidence supports the hypothesis that actin - depolymerizing factor ( ADF ) / coﬁlin pro - teins contribute to the depolymerization of actin ﬁlaments in cells ( for review see Moon & Drubin , 1995 ) . After initial discovery of ADF in embryonic chick brain ( Bamburg et al . , 1980 ) , other family members were widely found ( Mabuchi , 1981 ; Cooper et al . , 1986 ; Iida et al . , 1993 ; Moon et al . , 1993 ; Edwards et al . , 1994 ; Aizawa et al . , 1995 ) . These proteins bind ADP - actin monomers and ATP - actin ﬁlaments better than ATP or ADP - Pi actin ﬁlaments ( Maciver et al . , 1991 ; Maciver & Weeds , 1994 ; Carlier et al . , 1997 ; Blanchoin & Pollard , 1998 , 1999 ) . This allows ATP hydrolysis and phosphate dissociation to control when ADF / coﬁlin proteins bind ﬁlaments ( Maciver et al . , 1991 ; Blanchoin & Pollard , 1999 ) . Association with actin ﬁlaments severs them and promotes their dis - sociation of subunits ( Maciver et al . , 1991 ; Carlier et al . , 1997 ; Blanchoin & Pollard , 1999 ) . Stimulation of cells is correlated with rapid dephosphorylation of coﬁlin ( Ohta et al . , 1989 ; Davidson & Haslam , 1994 ; Okada et al . , 1996 ; Samstag et al . , 1996 ; Heyworth et al . , 1997 ) , suggesting that reversible phosphorylation of ADF / coﬁlin modulates the stability of the actin network during cell movement . LIM - kinase1 phos - phorylates coﬁlin in vivo ( Arber et al . , 1998 ; Yang et al . , 1998 ; Edwards & Gill , 1999 ) .

This suggests that coﬁlin may be an effector of a signal transduction mechanism that controls actin ﬁlament stability . Validation of this hypothesis requires knowledge about the effects of phos - phorylation . Limited biochemical assays ( pelleting assay using a single concentration of phosphorylated ( His ) 6 - tag coﬁlin ( Moriyama et al . , 1996 ) or DNase I inhibition assay ( Morgan et al . , 1993 ) ) ﬁrst suggested that phosphorylation of ADF / coﬁlin inhibits its interaction with actin . However , small quantities of phosphorylated coﬁlin have limited quantitative in vitro studies of the effect of phos - phorylation on the interaction of coﬁlin with actin ( Morgan et al . , 1993 ; Moriyama et al . , 1996 ) . As an alternative some studies utilized coﬁlin mutants with the phosphorylated serine replaced by aspar - tic or glutamic acid residues to mimic phosphoryl - ation ( Moriyama et al . , 1996 ; Ressad et al . , 1998 ; Smertenko et al . , 1998 ) . Using LIM - kinase activated by GST - Pak we were able to phosphorylate Acanthamoeba actophor - in stoichiometrically in vitro . We determined the atomic structure of phosphorylated actophorin and compared its function with unphosphorylated actophorin and two mutants of actophorin ( Ser1 to Asp or Ala ) . Ser1 corresponds to Ser3 in vertebrate coﬁlin . Phosphorylation of actophorin strongly inhibits its interaction with actin monomers and ﬁlaments without changing the conformation of the protein . This shows that Ser1 phosphorylation of actophorin directly blocks the interaction of ADF / coﬁlin with actin . The direct participation of Ser1 in actin binding is consistent with previously published work ( Lappalainen et al . , 1997 ) . About 30 % of actophorin is phosphorylated in live cells , so the amoeba , like vertebrate cells , but unlike yeast , uses phosphorylation to control the activity of actophorin . Results Actophorin phosphorylation in vitro and in vivo Treatment of actophorin with LIM - kinase acti - vated by GST - Pak1 converts 85 % of the protein to a more acidic species that can be resolved from untreated actophorin by isoelectric focusing ( Figure 1 ) . Edman degradation of control actophor - in yielded the expected N - terminal sequence ( SGIAVSDD ) without the initiator methionine which must be processed off by the bacterium . Edman degradation of the phosphorylated prep - aration yielded the same sequence except that the yield of serine on the ﬁrst cycle was at least 20 - fold lower than with the control . This establishes that LIM - kinase phosphorylates Ser1 , the residue equiv - alent to phosphorylated Ser3 of coﬁlin ( Edwards & Gill , 1999 ) . GST - Pak1 is required to activate LIM - kinase for efﬁcient phosphorylation of actophorin and coﬁlin ( Edwards et al . , 1999 ) . About 30 % of actophorin is phosphorylated in crude extracts of Acanthamoeba judged from isoelec - tric focusing and immunoblotting ( Figure 1 , lane 3 ) . To test whether the acidic form is phosphory - lated actophorin , we treated the extract with alka - line phosphatase , which removes phosphate from serine 3 of ADF ( Morgan et al . , 1993 ) . Treatment of Acanthamoeba extracts for 60 minutes converted all of the acidic actophorin into the basic unpho - sphorylated actophorin species ( Figure 1 , lane 4 ) . Incubation under identical conditions without alka - line phosphatase did not convert the acidic band ( Figure 1 , lane 5 ) . Atomic structure of phosphorylated actophorin We crystallized and determined the atomic structure of recombinant actophorin phosphory - lated in vitro by LIM - kinase ( Table 1 and Figure 2 ) . IEF conﬁrmed that the crystallized actophorin was fully phosphorylated . Table 1 presents the details of the data collection and reﬁnement statistics . The ﬁnal model has good geometry ( 0 . 012 A˚ r . m . s . deviation on bond lengths , 0 . 037 A˚ r . m . s . deviation on 1 , 3 distances ) , low average main - chain B - factors ( 20 . 8 A˚ 2 ) and reasonable R - factors ( R work , 20 . 4 % ; R free , 30 . 4 % ) . No signiﬁcant unaccounted for elec - tron density remained in the ﬁnal 2 j F o j (cid:255) j F c j elec - tron density map contoured at 1 s . All non - glycine residues lie in the favored regions ( 113 residues ) and in the additionally allowed regions ( eight resi - dues ) of the Ramachandran plot . The model of phosphorylated actophorin con - sists of residues 2 - 134 . In spite of several rounds of model rebuilding , no interpretable electron density for Ser1 appeared in the maps even at low contour levels ( Figure 2 ( a ) ) . The N terminus is distant from the neighboring molecules in the unit cell , so it has Table 1 .

Electron density for the backbone and side - chains is good throughout the remainder of the protein and showed no evidence for phosphorylation of the serine , threonine and tyrosine residues . By a process of elimination , serine 1 must be the phosphorylated residue . Its absence from the electron density map suggests that it may adopt multiple conformations . The structure of actophorin ( Leonard et al . , 1997 ) also lacks residue Ser1 and the structure of yeast coﬁlin is without the ﬁve N - terminal residues including residue Ser4 , the residue homologous to the LIM - kinase phosphorylation site of human coﬁlin ( Fedorov et al . , 1997 ) . The structure of phosphorylated actophorin is very similar to the structure of unphosphorylated actophorin ( Leonard et al . , 1997 ; Figure 2 ( b ) ) . The only region of divergence is the loop consisting of residues 68 to 76 . A second structure of unpho - sphorylated recombinant actophorin determined in our laboratory ( Robinson et al . , unpublished results ) adopts the structure of phosphorylated actophorin in this region . Thus the structural variability in this region probably arises from crystallographic packing rather than from effects of phosphorylation , so phosphorylation itself has no discernible effect on the structure of actophorin . Binding to actin monomers To characterize the interaction of phosphorylated actophorin with actin monomers , we exploited the ability of actophorin to inhibit the rate of nucleo - tide exchange from actin ( Nishida , 1985 ; Hawkins et al . , 1993 ; Lappalainen et al . , 1997 ; Blanchoin & Figure 1 . Isoelectric focusing of puriﬁed recombinant actophorin and amoeba extracts . Lanes 1 and 2 represent recombinant actophorin detected by staining with Coomas - sie blue .

( c ) A schematic representation of phosphorylated actophorin highlighting actin binding residues conserved between yeast coﬁlin and actophorin ( Lappalainen et al . , 1997 ) . Residues Gly2 , Lys92 , Lys94 , Gln116 and Asp119 ( shown in orange ) are conserved surface residues shown by mutagenesis to be involved in binding to both actin monomers and actin ﬁlaments . Residues Arg76 , Lys78 , Arg131 , and Lys133 ( shown in green ) are the conserved surface residues implicated in binding actin ﬁlaments alone . Structure , Function of Phosphorylated Actophorin 205 Pollard , 1998 ) . Saturating concentrations of acto - phorin inhibit Mg - ADP dissociation from muscle actin by 15 - fold ( Figures 3 ( a ) and ( b ) , Blanchoin & Pollard , 1998 ) , but a ﬁvefold molar excess of the phosphorylated actophorin preparation over actin monomers inhibits the rate of Mg - ADP dissociation from actin only by a factor 2 ( Figure 3 ( a ) , ﬁlled tri - angles ) . If phosphorylated actophorin were com - pletely inactive , a 16 . 8 % contamination of unphosphorylated actophorin could account for the observed twofold inhibition . This agrees closely with the known 15 % of unphosphorylated acto - phorin present in the phosphorylation mixture and suggests that the phosphorylated actophorin is inactive in this assay . A competition experiment between unphosphorylated actophorin and phos - phorylated actophorin ( Figure 3 ( a ) , ﬁlled circles ) ruled out the possibility that phosphorylated acto - phorin binds actin without affecting the dis - sociation of Mg - ADP . Mutant S1D weakly inhibits nucleotide exchange of monomeric actin with an apparent K d (cid:136) 8 . 3 m M ( Figure 3 ( a ) and ( b ) , open triangles ) . Mutant S1A inhibits nucleotide exchange like unphosphorylated actophorin . Binding to actin filaments A pelleting assay tested the ability of the various actophorins to bind an excess of actin ﬁlaments . About 70 % of unphosphorylated actophorin cose - diments with saturating concentrations of actin ﬁlaments ( Figure 4 , ﬁlled circles ) . Since actophorin depolymerizes some of the actin ﬁlaments and binds tightly to the released Mg - ADP - actin mono - mers 30 % of actophorin does not pellet with excess of actin ﬁlaments ( Figure 4 , ﬁlled circles ) . In the same assay , only about 20 % of the phosphorylated preparation ( open circles ) and the S1D mutant pel - let with saturating actin ﬁlaments ( open squares ) . In another pelleting experiment with a second preparation of phosphorylated actophorin ( 0 . 5 m M ) , 7 % of the actophorin pelleted with a large excess of actin ﬁlaments ( 10 m M ) , fraction similar to the 5 % unphosphorylated actophorin estimated by amino acid sequencing . S1A mutant binds ﬁlaments like wild - type actophorin . A similar pelleting assay with a low concen - tration of actin ﬁlaments and a range of actophorin concentrations tested the ability of the various actophorins to depolymerize ﬁlaments ( Figure 5 ) . Unphosphorylated actophorin converts ﬁlaments Figure 3 . Actophorin binding to actin monomers assayed by nucleotide exchange .

Coomassie blue - stained gels were digitized with a Microtek ScanMaker III and densities of gel bands were integrated by computer using NIH image . 206 Structure , Function of Phosphorylated Actophorin into a non - pelletable species ( ﬁlled squares and tri - angles ) , but phosphorylated actophorin does not ( open circles ) . With high concentrations of unpho - sphorylated actophorin , most of the actin is in the supernatant . The small fraction that pellets is heav - ily decorated with actophorin . In the case of phos - phorylated actophorin , most of the actin pellets with only a small fraction of the actophorin . S1D mutant ( open squares ) is similar to phosphorylated actophorin ( open squares ) . S1A is intermediate between wild - type and S1D actophorin . We con - clude that phosphorylation inhibits binding of actophorin to actin ﬁlaments and thus its effects on polymer stability . Discussion Phosphorylation of actophorin in vitro Previous reports ( Arber et al . , 1998 ; Yang et al . , 1998 ; Edwards & Gill , 1999 ) showed that LIM - kinase phosphorylates coﬁlin and actophorin but did not quantify the extent of phosphorylation . LIM - kinase is a poor kinase in vitro ( Edwards & Gill , 1999 ) which needs to be activated by Pak1 ( Edwards et al . , 1999 ) to increase its activity . Ours is the ﬁrst demonstration that LIM - kinase , acti - vated by Pak1 , stoichiometrically phosphorylates a member of the ADF / coﬁlin family ( Figure 1 ) . Pre - vious data ( Edwards & Gill , 1999 ) suggests that phosphorylation by LIM - kinase is highly speciﬁc for the N - terminal residues of ADF / coﬁlin family members . Our data shows that the phosphoryl - ation is speciﬁc to actophorin Ser1 . Structural and biochemical properties of the phosphorylated actophorin It is widely believed that phosphorylation of ADF / coﬁlins blocks their binding to actin mono - mers and ﬁlaments , but surprisingly , ours is the ﬁrst quantitative study of the afﬁnity . Previous work ( Morgan et al . , 1993 ; Moriyama et al . , 1996 ) using a single concentration of phosphorylated coﬁlin or ADF could not distinguish between total inhibition and a decrease in the afﬁnity . Quantitat - ive experiments were carried out using mutants with the phosphorylation site replaced by an aspartic or glutamic acid residue , but these mutants were not compared with phosphorylated protein ( Moriyama et al . , 1996 ; Lappalainen et al . , 1997 ; Ressad et al . , 1998 ) . We ﬁnd that the mutant actophorin S1D has a 12 - fold lower afﬁnity for Mg - ADP - actin than wild - type actophorin . Similarly S6D ADF1 has a 20 - fold lower afﬁnity than wild - type ADF1 ( Ressad et al . , 1998 ) . Phosphorylated actophorin has no detectable effect on nucleotide exchange from Mg - ATP or - ADP monomers at the concentration used ( tenfold over the K d of wild - type actophorin ; Figure 3 ( b ) , ﬁlled triangle ) . This shows that the phosphoryl - ation of Ser1 inhibits binding to actin monomers to a greater extent than the mutation of the Ser1 to aspartic acid . Similarly , we observed a weaker binding of phosphorylated actophorin to Mg - ADP Figure 5 . Depolymerization of actin ﬁlaments assayed by pelleting .

( b ) Quantiﬁcation of the concentration of pelleted actin over a range of actophorin concentrations : wild - type actophorin gels ( ﬁlled squares , triangles ) ; phosphorylated actophorin ( open circles ) ; S1D mutant actophorin ( open squares ) ; S1A mutant actophorin ( ﬁlled circles ) . Structure , Function of Phosphorylated Actophorin 207 ﬁlaments than the S1D mutant . Mutation of serine 1 to an alanine residue has no effect on the binding of actophorin to actin monomers but the reduced depolymerizing activity of S1A emphasizes the importance of the N terminus of actophorin during interaction with actin ﬁlaments . This result also shows that S1A mutation does not make the pro - tein constitutively active . Thus phosphorylation of actophorin appears to inactivate the protein by blocking binding to actin . This eliminates its effects on actin ﬁlament turn - over , either by severing ﬁlaments or promoting subunit dissociation or both . These ﬁndings sup - port the model where phosphorylation of acto - phorin stabilizes actin ﬁlaments in cells . The high efﬁciency of phosphorylation of acto - phorin by LIM - kinase allowed us to determine the crystal structure of phosphorylated actophorin . The structure of phosphorylated actophorin is essentially identical with the structure of unpho - sphorylated actophorin , although phosphorylated actophorin binds neither actin monomers nor ﬁla - ments . Therefore inhibition of actophorin inter - action with actin by phosphorylation of actophorin Ser1 is not a consequence of a conformational change but rather must disrupt an interaction of the N terminus of actophorin with actin that is essential for the stability of the complex . This was predicted from a molecular dynamics simulation of the coﬁlin / actin complex ( Wriggers et al . , 1998 ) . These authors proposed a model where phos - phorylation of coﬁlin Ser4 disrupts a potential salt bridge between the proteins . More detailed struc - tures of actin bound to ADF / coﬁlin proteins are required to understand the details of the inhibition of the interaction of actophorin and actin by phos - phorylation . Regulation of actophorin in vivo A fraction of ADF / coﬁlin is phosphorylated in resting cells ( Nebl et al . , 1996 ; Heyworth et al . , 1997 ) . Stimulated cells rapidly dephosphorylate coﬁlin ( Nebl et al . , 1996 ; Heyworth et al . , 1997 ) . Similarly , dephosphorylation of Xenopus ADF / coﬁ - lin occurs in eggs after fertilization ( Abe et al . , 1996 ) . This is proposed to increase the turnover of actin ﬁlaments . Our biochemical ﬁndings are con - sistent with this hypothesis , but some cells appear to lack the capacity to phosphorylate their ADF / coﬁlins . For example , no phosphorylated coﬁlin has been found in yeast ( Lappalainen et al . , 1997 ) or Dictyostelium discoideum ( Iida & Aizawa , unpub - lished results ) . Perhaps these cells have other mechanisms to stabilize actin ﬁlaments or have adapted to life without regulated ADF / coﬁlins . Like motile vertebrate cells , amoeba may use phos - phorylation to regulate actophorin activity or local - ization . Unphosphorylated actophorin maybe excluded from regions of the cell requiring stable ﬁlaments . Materials and Methods Reagents Materials came from the following sources : Sigma , dithiothreitol ( DTT ) , EDTA , Tris , sodium azide , hexo - kinase , ATP , ADP ; molecular probes ( Eugene , OR ) , 1 , N 6 - ethenoadenosine - 5 0 - diphosphate ( e - ADP ) ; Boehringer Mannheim , alkaline phosphatase . Preparation of mutant actophorins Ser1 of actophorin was changed to alanine or aspartic acid residues by polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis and the mutations were veriﬁed by amino acid sequen - cing . Wild - type and mutant actophorin in plasmid vector pMW172 were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 ( DE3 ) pLysS and puriﬁed ( Quirk et al . , 1993 ) . Puriﬁed actophorins were stored in 10 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 1 mM EDTA , 2 mM DTT , 1 mM NaN 3 . Other proteins Actin was puriﬁed from rabbit muscle acetone pow - der ( Spudich & Watt , 1971 ) and isolated as Ca - ATP - G - actin through Sephacryl S - 300 chromatography ( MacLean - Fletcher & Pollard , 1980 ) at 4 (cid:14) C in G buffer ( 5 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 8 . 0 ) , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 5 mM DTT , 1 mM NaN 3 ) . Mg - e - ADP - G - actin was pre - pared by treatment of Mg - ATP - G - actin with soluble hex - okinase and glucose ( Pollard , 1984 ) . Actophorin phosphorylation by LIM - kinase Phosphorylation in vitro of actophorin was carried out as described by Edwards & Gill ( 1999 ) , using 200 m M ATP , 50 mM Hepes ( pH 7 . 4 ) , 2 mM MnCl 2 , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 150 mM NaCl , actophorin between 50 - 100 m M , the kinase domain of LIM - kinase ( Kd3 ) expressed in SF9 cells and cleaved from the GST and a molar excess over Kd3 of GST - Pak . Reactions were incubated at 30 (cid:14) C for 3 hours . To determine the extent of phosphorylation 20 m l of concentrated reaction mixture was loaded on a ﬁlter paper and separated by IEF ( ampholines 3 to 10 ) in 0 . 5 % agarose gel at 10 (cid:14) C . Coomassie blue - stained gels were digitized with a Microtek ScanMaker III and the percen - tage of phosphorylated actophorin was determined by integration of the density of the gel band . Dephosphory - lation of actophorin was achieved by alkaline phospha - tase treatment of amoeba extracts after protein denaturation as described by Morgan et al . ( 1993 ) . Brieﬂy , both control and alkaline phosphatase - treated extracts ( in the presence of 40U of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase ) were incubated at 37 (cid:14) C for one hour . The reaction was terminated by precipitation of the protein ( Wessel & Flugge , 1984 ) . Determination of the phosphorylation of actophorin in amoebas Amoebas were pelleted out of their growth medium , suspended in two volumes of 10 mM Tris ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 1 mM EDTA , 1 mM ATP , 1 mM DTT , 1 . 5 m M okadaic acid and calyculin A at 4 (cid:14) C and lysed by sonication . Samples of supernatant were separated by IEF as above . Proteins were transferred for 1 hour to a nitrocellulose membrane and probed with afﬁnity puriﬁed polyclonal antibodies to actophorin . Antibody preparation and 208 Structure , Function of Phosphorylated Actophorin puriﬁcation from blots was carried out using puriﬁed actophorin according to Earnshaw et al . ( Earnshaw et al . , 1987 ) . Crystal growth , data collection and processing Crystals of phosphorylated actophorin were grown using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 4 (cid:14) C from a 10 mg / ml protein solution in 10 mM Tris - Cl ( pH 8 . 0 ) and a reservoir solution of 14 % ( w / v ) Polyethy - lene glycol ( PEG ) 8000 , 100 mM Mops ( pH 7 . 0 ) ( 2 m l of protein solution (cid:135) 2 m L of reservoir solution ) . The crys - tals reached full size in approximately three days . Crys - tals were transferred into 20 % ( v / v ) glycerol , 14 % PEG 8000 , 100 mM Mops ( pH 7 . 0 ) , ﬁve minutes before freez - ing in a stream of N 2 at 100 K . A second crystal from the same drop was subjected to IEF electrophoresis to verify that these crystals contained the phosphorylated form of actophorin . The data set ( Table 1 ) was collected from a single crystal using a MacScience generator and detector . Data were indexed , integrated and corrected for Lorentz effects using the program DENZO ( Otwinowski , 1993 ) . Scaling , merging of intensities and conversion to struc - ture factors were achieved using the program SCALE - PACK ( Otwinowski , 1993 ) . Molecular replacement and refinement The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the unphosphorylated actophorin structure ( Leonard et al . , 1997 ) as the search model in the program EPMR ( Kissinger et al . , 1999 ) . The unambiguous solution was then subjected to rigid body , restrained and B - factor reﬁnement and a bulk solvent correction applied in the program REFMAC ( CCP4 , 1994 ) . Several rounds of model rebuilding utilizing the program O ( Jones , 1991 ) followed by further reﬁnement resulted in the present model . The program PROCHECK ( Laskowski , 1993 ) was used to assess the ﬁnal structure . j F o j (cid:255) j F c j , 2 j F o j (cid:255) j F c j , 3 j F o j (cid:255) 2 j F c j electron density maps were inspected at sev - eral different sigma levels ( 0 . 5 - 3 . 0 s ) in an effort to locate terminal residues not present in the ﬁnal model . All ser - ine residues were considered particularly carefully for possible extra electron density that may have indicated phosphorylation . Schematic representations of the ﬁnal model were created using the program MOLSCRIPT ( Kraulis , 1991 ) . Nucleotide exchange assay The dissociation of Mg - e - ADP from muscle actin monomers was measured by the decrease in ﬂuorescence using excitation and emission wavelengths of 360 nm and 410 nm respectively . Fluorescence measurements were conducted with a PTI Alpha - scan spectroﬂuori - meter ( Photon Technologies International , South Bruns - wick , NJ ) . A Hi - tech SFA - II rapid mixer allowed mixing of equal volumes of 600 m M ATP from one syringe with 2 . 8 m M Mg - e - ADP - actin and various concentration of actophorin . Actin co - pelleting assay Various concentrations of actophorin and ﬁlamentous actin incubated together and then centrifuged at 279 , 000 g for 30 minutes at 24 (cid:14) C to pellet actin ﬁlaments . Supernatants and pellets were collected and proteins were separated by SDS - PAGE . Coomassie blue - stained gels were digitized with a Microtek ScanMaker III and the density of gel bands was quantiﬁed in the super - natant and pellet using NIH image . Protein Data Bank accession code The atomic coordinates of phosphorylated actophorin have been deposited with the protein data bank acces - sion code 1CNU .
