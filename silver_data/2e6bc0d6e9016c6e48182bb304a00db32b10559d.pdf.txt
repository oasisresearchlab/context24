This study is based on the data collected from 5 Volumes , consisting of 30 issues , carrying 171 articles , citing 2754 references from 575 citing sources of IJPAM published from 2009 to 2013 . Whereas for collecting cited references , every published article from the official website of the journal namely Indian National Science Academy ( INSA ) was downloaded , for citing references , Google Scholar and Scopus both were explored to recognize the maximum number of citing sources during October 2017 . The study revealed that journal articles are the most cited references , whereas citing references are mostly from the journals of foreign origin . Majority of cited articles are available in non - open access form , though the citations came from both , open and non - open journals . Joint authorship was found to be predominant , in both cited - citing references .

Introduction : Journals are considered to be primary means of communication among researchers for their R & D activities It is essential to know the cited - citing pattern and current trends etc . of journals . Citing literature is a common usage among researchers . It portrays the relationship between the citing document and the cited document and also contributes to the reader’s understanding of the process of scientific communication [ 1 ] . Publishing of articles is a crucial form of scholarly publications in all disciplines . Indian Journal of Pure and Applied Mathematics : An overview The Indian Journal of Pure and Applied Mathematics ( IJPAM ) is published by the Indian National Science Academy ( INSA ) . IJPAM is one of the prestigious journals in the field of mathematics , devoted to primary research in all areas of Pure and Applied Mathematics , Statistics and other related areas . The journal started as quarterly publication in 1970 but changed its frequency to monthly from 1973 . It became bimonthly in 2006 and later as quarterly in 2016 . IJPAM is indexed in Science Citation Index , Mathematical Review , Current Content and INSPEC Science Abstract . Since 2010 IJPAM has co - published with Springer ( India ) Pvt . Ltd [ 2 ] . Over the years , the reference citation of the journal has increased globally . Literature Review : Very few studies have attempted to make an assessment of scientific publications of mathematics journals . Lipetz ( 1965 ) utilized 29 indicators to code the relationship between citing and cited papers to improve the effectiveness of information retrieval [ 3 ] . Garfield ( 1980 ) analyzedthe influence of Merton , an eminent sociologist , on the basis of articles citing his publications in the social sciences except sociology , which accounted for 56 % of the total number of citing articles , followed by sociology articles ( 36 % ) and natural sciences articles ( 8 % ) [ 4 ] . Hargens ( 2000 ) used two methods namely , reference network and citation context analysis to examine differences in the structure of scholarship among seven research areas in the natural sciences , social sciences , and the humanities [ 5 ] . Mukherjee , B . ( 2009 ) examined the pattern of cited citing hyperlinked references of 17 open access journals of library and information science . They found that 162 articles do not have any cited references while remaining 1474 articles have an average of 23 . 7 % references per articles [ 6 ] . Narang , A . ( 2004 ) evaluated the Indian Journal of Pure and Applied Mathematics , where they found that journals are more preferred choice of cited sources among authors of mathematics [ 7 ] . Shokeen and Kaushik ( 2004 ) conducted the citation analysis on Indian Journal of Plant Physiology , wherein they found that 81 . % journal articles and 14 % books are cited . 39 % of citing articles are three - authored , whereas 26 % are two authored . Most of the cited articles in these issues were published not more than twenty years ago [ 8 ] . Chaubey and Mukherjee ( 2018 ) assessed the cited and citing pattern of open Access Journals in Physics , Chemistry and Mathematics . It was found that journals are predominant cited and citing sources in physics , chemistry and mathematics disciplines . Of the total 2799 cited source in physics , and 3918 cited sources in chemistry , almost 68 % and 74 % , respectively , was close access . Whereas in mathematics the trend was different , share of open and non - open access cited sources were almost same , i . e . 49 % and 50 % , respectively . Approximately 90 % citations of physics - chemistry and 68 % citations of mathematics disciplines came after two years of publication [ 9 ] . Objective : • To trace out the cited - citing references in terms of source , authorship , subject diversity and accessibility . • To find out the citation characteristics in terms of citation - age , quantity & citing - life Method of Study The present study is designed to evaluate the cited - citing references pattern of Indian Journal of Pure and Applied Mathematics ( IJPAM ) from the period of 2009 to 2013 . Cited references download from the official website of INSA . Whereas , for citing references , explore from Google Scholar and Scopus of citing source to identify the number of citing sources . Each article title was searched in Google Scholar and Scopus to find the maximum number of web citations ( citing references ) it had received , the result with the highest number of web citations was taken for further analysis . Each article was analyzed to record the details of the title , sources , authorship , number of references for each article , type of references , citation age , citing life and accessibility etc . The present study consists 5 Volumes , 30 issues , 171 articles , 2754 cited references and 575 citing references . Result and Discussion Figure : 1 . Overview of cited - citing articles / references Figure 1 represents the total no . of cited – citing references and articles . As indicates in above 2010 received 49 . 21 % maximum citation while 2010 and 2013 contained 25 . 14 % maximum articles . In 2009 received both 5 . 91 % minimum citation and contained 9 . 94 % minimum articles .

Table 3 reveals the pattern of cited - citing reference according to source of citation . As indicated in table 3 journals are the most preferred information sources of citation . This finding is similar with the findings of Glanzel & Schoepflin ( 1999 ) where they found that mostly journal articles as references to serials nearly 80 % deal with the sciences . Books are second preferred choice of cited - citing sources among researcher of mathematics [ 10 ] . Conference proceeding are third preferred choice of researcher in cited sources while citing sources thesis / dissertation are third preferred choice of researcher in mathematics . In mathematics authors cite ( 19 . 26 % ) books in 2010 , ( 17 . 80 % ) books in 2009 while writing their articles . On other hand , articles in mathematics also receive considerable number of citations ( 11 . 4 % ) from books in 2009 after journal articles .

Of the total 707 articles authors cited most of the articles i . e . 87 . 69 % in 2010 that were published before five or more years old . On other hand22 . 22 % or 666 cited articles were published within five years in 2012 . The result of the present study is quite different from the findings Cole’s ( 1983 ) examine the citation of the journals of seven disciplines ( biochemistry , chemistry , geometry , mathematics , physics , psychology , and sociology ) found that whereas 55 to 62 % of the citations in physics , biochemistry , and chemistry were works published within 5 years [ 11 ] .

We considered an article is of Indian origin in case of the first or all of its authors belongs to an Indian organizations / institution’s etc . ; and we considered an article is of foreign origin in case of first or all of its authors belongs to some organizations / institutions etc . situated outside India . It was noticed that whereas authors wrote their article they generally cite article that were of foreign origin and their articles also receive citations mostly from articles that were of foreign origin . In the year 2012 almost 84 . 21 % cite foreign origin while their works are also received the almost 96 . 18 % citation from foreign origin in 2012 .

The proportion of open and non - open access cited sources were almost same , i . e . 49 % and 50 % , respectively in 2009 . For citing source , it was observed that the proportion of open and non - open access citing source in were almost equal in 2009 . The mostly cited - citing sources are not freely accessed . Figure : 2 . Age of open access vs non open access in cited - citing articles Figure 2 show that cited and citing articles are available mostly non open access form .

In 2009 IJPAM authors cited mostly published articles ( 88 . 94 % ) their work in mathematics followed by 2011 ( 88 . 36 % ) , 2010 ( 87 . 87 % ) , 2012 ( 84 . 13 % ) and 2013 ( 79 . 1 % ) their own work in mathematics . Furthermore , authors of IJPAM cited a considerable number of articles multidisciplinary subject 2013 ( 17 . 74 % ) , 2012 ( 11 . 52 % ) . On other side , articles of IJPAM author received almost citation 2011 ( 90 . 66 % ) , 2012 ( 88 . 03 % ) , 2010 ( 87 . 18 % ) from their subject field .

Almost 85 . 33 % and 83 . 75 % citation came after two years . Conclusion : The present study concludes the relationship between cited - citing patterns of IJPAM . Therefore outputs based analysis of IJPAM and address the issues including source , authorship , subject diversity , accessibility , citation age and citing life . This study may be explained in the age of 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 % Uncited Art % Cited Art internet still peer - reviewed journals are the most preferred choice . This study also explains performing research multiple authorship and citing foreign origin literature in IJPAM is common practice in these days . Whereas authors in IJPAM publish mostly journal articles and publish a significant quantity of books and Conference proceedings . However , research also has shown that authors cite more journal articles than books and found a tendency to use literature published before 5 years or even later . Citing references to IJPAM were more than two years later of publication . These may indicate that the research output of this journal does not necessarily generate immediate impact within 1 to 2 years of its publication . However , we observed that almost cited source of this journal was not accessible freely . This may be suggesting that in citation depends on the relevancy of literature , not on access type .
