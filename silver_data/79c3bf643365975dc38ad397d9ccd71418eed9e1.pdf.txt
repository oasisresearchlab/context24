It is highly concentrated in the postsynaptic density fraction , exceeding the amount of any other signal transduction molecules . Because kinase signaling can be ampliﬁed by catalytic reaction , why CaMKII exists in such a large quantity has been a mystery . Here , we provide biochemical evidence that CaMKII is capable of bundling F - actin through a stoichiometric interaction . Consistent with this evidence , in hippocampal neurons , RNAi - mediated down - regulation of CaMKII leads to a reduction in the volume of dendritic spine head that is mediated by F - actin dynam - ics . An overexpression of CaMKII slowed down the actin turnover in the spine head . This activity was associated with (cid:2) subunit of CaMKII in a manner requiring its actin - binding and association domains but not the kinase domain . This ﬁnding indicates that CaMKII serves as a central signaling molecule in both functional and structural changes during synaptic plasticity . cytoskeleton (cid:1) plasticity (cid:1) synapse I n hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells , a transient burst of synaptic input potentiates the efficiency of subsequent transmission ( 1 ) . This phenomenon , long - term potentiation ( LTP ) , has been con - sidered as a cellular counterpart of memory , and its molecular mechanisms have been intensively studied . A strong postsynaptic depolarization caused by high - frequency input induces a Ca 2 (cid:1) influx through postsynaptic NMDA receptors , which then triggers a series of biochemical processes , including an activation of a serine / threonine protein kinase , Ca 2 (cid:1) / calmodulin - dependent pro - tein kinase II ( CaMKII ) . The activation of CaMKII is followed by a series of autophosphorylation events , which enables active CaMKII to stay activated until all subunits are dephosphorylated ( 2 ) . This activated CaMKII phosphorylates AMPA receptor and various other postsynaptic proteins , which triggers a mechanism eventuallyleadingtoanenhancementofAMPAreceptor - mediated synaptic transmission ( 2 – 9 ) . In addition to the functional change typically measured by electrophysiological recordings , recent works revealed another aspect of synaptic plasticity : the structural changes associated with the functional modifications ( 10 – 13 ) . During LTP of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells , a dendritic spine , the tiny protrusion where most of excitatory synapses are harbored in this class of neurons , expands within (cid:2) 60 s after the LTP - inducing stimulation ( 12 , 13 ) . Antagonists for both NMDA receptor and CaMKII blocked the effect of tetanic stimulation ; therefore , the activation of NMDA receptor and CaMKII are both important for structural plasticity ( 12 , 13 ) . This observation encouraged us to explore the role that CaMKII activity plays in the regulation of postsynaptic structure . CaMKII is found in a large quantity in postsynaptic density fraction much more than any other signal transduction molecules , almost comparable with cytoskeletal components ( 14 , 15 ) . This knowledge led us and others to speculate that CaMKII may serve not only as a signal transduction molecule but also as a structural element at synapses ( 2 , 14 ) . In relation to this speculation , it has been demonstrated that CaMKII binds to F - actin through a specific sequence present in the (cid:1) subunit ( 16 – 20 ) , but this interaction has been considered to anchor CaMKII to the postsynaptic sites . However , considering that CaMKII is an oligomeric protein com - posed of 12 – 14 subunits with rotational symmetry ( 2 ) , it is possible that one oligomer can simultaneously bind to multiple F - actin , thereby acting as an F - actin - bundling protein at postsynaptic sites . Here , we show evidence that CaMKII is in fact not only a signaling protein , but also a structural protein that bundles F - actin through a specific and stoichiometric interaction mediated by the (cid:1) subunit , and that such capacity is required for the maintenance of the postsynaptic architecture of the dendritic spine . This work ascribes a specific , previously undescribed role for CaMKII as a cytoskeletal component in the postsynaptic structure . Results F - Actin Is Bundled by CaMKII . To demonstrate the F - actin - bundling activity of CaMKII , we first used the conventional F - actin cosedi - mentation assay ( 21 ) . Purified non - muscle actin was polymerized and coincubated with purified CaMKII ( heteromeric complex of (cid:2) and (cid:1) ) . The resultant complex was centrifuged at 10 , 000 (cid:3) g , at which linear , unbundled F - actin stays in supernatant but bundled F - actin precipitates ( 21 ) . Upon separation of both fractions on an SDS / PAGE , F - actin was detected in the supernatant when CaMKII was absent , but in the pellet when CaMKII was present ( Fig . 1 a ) . CaMKII without F - actin did not form a pellet , indicating that CaMKII itself did not form complexes that precipitate , and that an interaction between F - actin and CaMKII was indeed needed to form the pellet . This activity was associated with (cid:1) subunit of CaMKII , but not with the (cid:2) subunit , a finding consistent with the presence of an F - actin binding sequence in CaMKII (cid:1) but not in (cid:2) . The concentration response curve of CaMKII (cid:1) at a fixed concen - tration of actin indicates that the maximum effect was attained at a molar ratio of actin to CaMKII (cid:1) of higher than 1 : 1 ( or 1 : (cid:2) 0 . 08 , as CaMKII (cid:1) holoenzyme ; Fig . 1 b ) . This stoichiometry of actin and CaMKII is reasonable in view of the amount of these two proteins present in the postsynaptic density fraction ( 15 ) . We next attempted to visualize the F - actin bundling by CaMKII . We negatively stained F - actin filaments formed in the presence or absence of CaMKII and observed them using electron microscopy ( Fig . 1 c ) . In the absence of CaMKII , F - actin did not show bundling . In contrast , in the presence of CaMKII , F - actin formed clear bundles . Again , this activity was associated with CaMKII (cid:1) ; homo - Authorcontributions : K . - I . O . andR . N . contributedequallytothiswork ; K . - I . O . , R . N . , S . H . L . , and Y .

This assay , in con - junction with the cosedimentation assay , establishes that CaMKII is an F - actin - bundling protein , consistent with a recent report ( 20 ) . CaMKII Does Not Affect Kinetics of Polymerization and Depolymer - ization of Actin . Given the bundling activity of CaMKII (cid:1) , we wondered whether binding of CaMKII affects the kinetics of actin polymerization or depolymerization . To test this hypothesis , we used standard fluorescence measurement of actin polymerization / depolymerization using pyrene conjugated actin ( 22 ) . The poly - merization was initiated by the addition of actin polymerization buffer to G - actin in the presence and absence of CaMKII . A sigmoidal curve showing the lag phase , the log phase and the plateau phase of polymerization was observed . The addition of CaMKII , both unphosphorylated ( Fig . 2 a ) and phosphorylated ( data not shown ) , did not largely change the actin polymerization kinetics . We also tested depolymerization of F - actin to G - actin ( Fig . 2 b ) . We induced depolymerization of preformed pyrene - labeled F - actin by diluting 10 - fold in the presence or absence of CaMKII (cid:1) . The addition of CaMKII did not change the rate of depolymeriza - tion significantly . We used the actin polymerizing drug phalloidin as a control for these experiments ( data not shown ) . These results indicate that despite clear bundling of F - actin , the kinetics of polymerization and depolymerization are largely unaltered by CaMKII (cid:1) . CaMKII (cid:2) but Not - (cid:3) Is Necessary for Maintaining Synaptic Structure . F - actin composes the primary cytoskeleton in the dendritic spine , where it is responsible for structural maintenance and plasticity ( 12 , 23 – 25 ) . Because CaMKII bundles F - actin in vitro , it is likely that CaMKII also plays a structural role in dendritic spines by bundling F - actin . To test whether endogenous CaMKII in dendritic spines has such a role , we first tested the effects of specific reduction of CaMKII (cid:2) and - (cid:1) proteins by using RNAi and then observing the resulting dendritic spine structure . We constructed plasmid - based short hairpin RNA ( shRNA ) expression vectors , which specifically down - regulate CaMKII (cid:2) or - (cid:1) respectively ( Fig . 3 a ) . They were biolistically transfected in CA1 pyramidal cells in hippocampal organotypic slice culture along with GFP to visualize the structure by using two - photon microscopy . shRNA against CaMKII (cid:2) did not have any effect on the number and structure of dendritic spines compared with vector alone ( Fig . 3 b – e ) . In contrast , the shRNA against CaMKII (cid:1) significantly reduced the number of mature dendritic spines and increased the number of long filopodial structures often seen in immature neurons ( Fig . 3 b – d ) . Impor - tantly , the total number of protrusions was unchanged with these manipulations , indicating that the effect of CaMKII (cid:1) shRNA was not to generate new filopodial structures ( Fig . 3 e ) . This effect was completely rescued by cotransfecting an expression vector of CaMKII (cid:1) cDNA with silent mutations at the shRNA target sequence ( indicated as (cid:1) R in Fig . 3 ) but to a lesser extent by using the expression vector carrying the original CaMKII (cid:1) cDNA , con - firming the specificity of the effect of shRNA . Thus , we show that CaMKII , specifically the (cid:1) subunit , is necessary for the mainte - nance of mature spine structure . Fig . 1 . CaMKII bundles F - actin .

We next tested whether kinase activity is necessary for maintaining dendritic spine structure by CaMKII (cid:1) . This hypothesis was tested by rescuing the effect of shRNA using CaMKII (cid:1) R K43R , a mutant lacking kinase activity combined with silent mutations that make it resistant to RNAi . This mutant had an actin - bundling activity comparable with wild type CaMKII (cid:1) in a biochemical experiment ( see below ) . If the kinase function is not necessary for spine structure maintenance , this mutant should be sufficient to rescue the spine structure phenotype observed with CaMKII (cid:1) shRNA . As predicted , we found that CaMKII (cid:1) R K43R fully rescued the phenotypes observed with shRNA against CaMKII (cid:1) ( Fig . 3 b – e ) . It is still possible that the kinase domain itself has a structural role independent of the kinase activity . For example , a synaptic scaf - folding protein CASK / mLIN - 2 has a domain similar to the kinase domain of CaMKII , which serves as an interaction interface with Mint - 1 / mLIN - 10 but has no kinase activity ( 26 ) . Therefore , it is possible the K43R mutant may still have such function . To rule out this possibility , we tested two deletion mutants CaMKII (cid:1) 285 – 542 and (cid:1) 344 – 542 lacking kinase domain but still having the F - actin binding and association domains . These deletion mutants also fully rescued the effect of CaMKII (cid:1) shRNA ( Fig . 3 b – e ) . This result indicates that the F - actin binding domain oligomerized together through the associating domain is sufficient for the rescue . These results are most compatible with the idea that the major role of CaMKII in unstimulated synapse is to bundle F - actin and such activity is important for the maintenance of mature dendritic spine structure . CaMKII (cid:2) but Not - (cid:3) Affects the Turnover of Actin in Dendritic Spine . Because we have shown that CaMKII (cid:1) is an F - actin - bundling protein in vitro , we next attempted to observe evidence of the bundling of F - actin by CaMKII in the postsynaptic structure . However , likely because of high density of proteins including actin itself and possible instability during processing , it has been difficult to reveal discrete structure of F - actin in dendritic spine both under light and electron microscopy ( 12 , 24 , 25 ) . Also , these techniques do not necessarily give insight into the chemical and functional prop - erties of actin . It has been demonstrated that the actin molecules in dendritic spines undergo constant turnover at a rate regulated by neuronal activity ( 12 , 25 ) . Therefore , we used fluorescent recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) assay to monitor the turnover of actin molecules in dendritic spines . We overexpressed untagged CaMKII (cid:1) along with GFP - actin . We assumed that such an over - expression would result in the formation of an oligomer dominant in the (cid:1) subunit , having a greater number of F - actin binding sites and therefore more efficient stabilization of F - actin at dendritic spines compared with endogenous CaMKII , which is composed of both (cid:2) and (cid:1) subunits . GFP - actin in a single dendritic spine was photobleached and thereafter the recovery of its fluorescence was monitored ( Fig . 4 ) . The GFP signal recovered to its original level within 2 min , consistent with a previous report ( 25 ) . In the presence of overexpressed CaMKII (cid:1) , the turnover was significantly slower , whereas CaMKII (cid:2) did not have such an effect ( Fig . 4 ) . We could not compare actin turnover in shRNA expressing neurons because the structure of spines were altered dramatically by reduction of CaMKII (cid:1) ( Fig . 3 ) . The effect of CaMKII (cid:1) on actin turnover did not require kinase activityorthekinasedomainitself .

The exact mechanism is currently unknown . 6420 (cid:1) www . pnas . org (cid:2) cgi (cid:2) doi (cid:2) 10 . 1073 (cid:2) pnas . 0701656104 Okamoto et al . same effect on actin turnover as wild - type CaMKII (cid:1) ( Fig . 4 d and e ) . Also , with deletion mutants lacking the kinase domain but containing actin binding and association domains ( CaMKII (cid:1) 285 – 542 and (cid:1) 344 – 542 ) , we observed the same effect as full length CaMKII (cid:1) ( Fig . 4 d and e ) . Rather it requires oligomerization of actin - binding domain of CaMKII (cid:1) , because a deletion mutant of CaMKII (cid:1) 1 – 401 without the association domain and also (cid:1) 285 – 401 without the kinase and association domains failed to show the effect on actin turnover ( Fig . 4 d and e ) . Presently , it is not clear how CaMKII (cid:1) slows down FRAP of GFP - actin . Whereas CaMKII did not have a direct impact on polymerization and depolymerization kinetics of actin ( Fig . 2 ) , in dendrites , CaMKII bundling of F - actin may cause inhibition of diffusion or access to actin depolymerizing / severing proteins that affect F - actin dynamics . Given this , however , the most important finding here is that CaMKII affects the actin turnover in a way independent of kinase activity or domain and rather requires an intact actin binding domain associated with each other . This is not expected if CaMKII is purely a signal transduction protein or if the bindingwithactinisamechanismtodeliverCaMKIItothesynapse . Rather , it is most reasonably explained by a structural function of CaMKII to bundle F - actin . Activation of CaMKII Leads to a Loss of Bundling Activity . We finally wanted to see whether the kinase activity is involved in the regulation of actin bundling . To test this , we preformed bundled F - actin with CaMKII (cid:1) and subsequently activated the enzyme by addition of Ca 2 (cid:1) / calmodulin . To reveal a specific effect of auto - phosphorylation , EGTA was added at indicated time to remove the Ca 2 (cid:1) / calmodulin complex from CaMKII and the coincubation was continued . We observed a significant reversal of bundling of F - actin after CaMKII was activated by Ca 2 (cid:1) / calmodulin ( Fig . 5 a ) . The reversal of bundling after activation by Ca 2 (cid:1) / calmodulin increased with longer exposure of CaMKII to Ca 2 (cid:1) / calmodulin . This was not observed with a K43R mutant , confirming the importance of autophosphorylation ( Fig . 5 b ) . However , the F - actin - bundling ac - tivity of K43R was also blocked by Ca 2 (cid:1) / calmodulin if EGTA was not added and Ca 2 (cid:1) / calmodulin remained attached to the kinase throughout the bundling and sedimentation steps ( Fig . 5 b ) , con - firming previous results that calmodulin binding impairs F - actin binding ( 18 , 19 ) . Taken together , both Ca 2 (cid:1) / calmodulin binding and the subsequent autophosphorylation work in concert to reverse CaMKII - mediated bundling of F - actin . Consistent with this finding , the actin binding region of CaMKII contains multiple serines / threonines , many of which are actually autophosphorylated rapidly upon activation ( M . K . Hayashi , R . Narayanan , and Y . Hayashi , unpublished ) . 0 120 240 360 50 100 0 120 240 360 50 100 Time ( sec ) Time ( sec ) F l uo r esce n ce ( % B ase li n e ) F l uo r esce n ce ( % B ase li n e ) a b Photobleach 0 . 5 µm 30 0 60 90 ( sec ) - 15 - 30 - 45 c d e 2 µm 0 50 100 0 50 100 Time constant ( sec ) C u m u l a t i ve % 0 50 100 G F P - ac t i n * * * * T i m e c on s t a n t ( sec ) * : p < 0 . 05 Autoinhibitory / CaM Binding Kinase Assoc .

This requires the presence of the (cid:1) subunit in the CaMKII oligomer but not kinase activity itself . This feature of CaMKII is necessary for maintaining the dendritic spine structure . Not only that , when kinase is activated , CaMKII looses the ability to bundle F - actin . Both binding with Ca 2 (cid:1) / calmodulin and autophosphory - lation of CaMKII contribute to this event . It has been speculated that CaMKII might have a structural role because of its abundance in the postsynaptic density ( 2 , 14 ) ; our report demonstrates a specific structural role for CaMKII as an F - actin - bundling protein necessary for maintenance of postsynaptic structure . Previous reports indicate that the overexpression of CaMKII (cid:1) but not (cid:2) in neurons in dissociated culture increases filopodia motility , dendritic arborization , and spine density ( 27 , 28 ) . These effects were abolished by blocking kinase activity with a point mutation or a kinase inhibitor . Whereas it is possible that the precise location of kinase activity is important for these effects ( 27 ) , it is also possible that the bundling of F - actin and its dynamic regulation by a mechanism involving kinase activity may be important . CaMKII accumulates on the dendritic spine upon neuronal stimulation ( 19 , 20 , 29 – 31 ) . Because CaMKII (cid:2) does not bundle F - actin but still shows activity dependent accumulation , the accu - mulation is independent of F - actin binding ( 19 ) . Instead , self - association of CaMKII ( 20 , 30 ) or binding with the NR2B subunit of NMDA receptors ( 31 ) , densin - 180 ( 32 , 33 ) , and / or (cid:2) - actinin ( 32 – 34 ) may play a role in such activity - dependent synaptic delivery of CaMKII . In view of these results , we suggest the following model for the role of CaMKII in structural plasticity ( Fig . 6 ) . At resting synapses , F - actin is bundled by CaMKII , thereby maintaining a stable struc - ture . When CaMKII is activated by neuronal activity and the resultant Ca 2 (cid:1) influx , it detaches from F - actin and allows its reorganization by other signal transduction machineries , such as small G proteins . Meanwhile , more CaMKII are recruited to the synapse by self - association or interaction of NR2B to play a role as a signal transduction molecule . Such mechanism may also set a new level for the amount of CaMKII at dendritic spines , which may in turn affect the amount of bundled F - actin in the spines , and consequently the structure of the dendritic spines . Upon returning to the unphosphorylated state , CaMKII bundles the newly reorga - nized F - actin and maintains the remodeled spine structure . In this way , CaMKII may have a serve as a ‘‘gating’’ mechanism that keeps dendritic spine structure constant at resting Ca 2 (cid:1) levels , allowing modification when the Ca 2 (cid:1) level increases , and subsequently preserving the plastic change . Duration of activated CaMKII gives a time - window during which actin can be remodeled . Consistent with this view , the structural plasticity of dendritic spines requires CaMKII activation ( 13 ) . In this way , CaMKII plays a dual role in excitatory synaptic plasticity : a signaling role during neuronal activity , and an actin - bundling role during the basal state in dendritic spines , thereby affecting both functional and structural plasticity of dendritic spines Methods Expression Vectors . Baculoviral expression vectors for rat CaMKII (cid:2) and - (cid:1) have been reported ( 35 , 36 ) . Human (cid:1) - actin fused with GFP is from Clontech ( Mountain View , CA ) . Untagged rat CaMKII (cid:2) and (cid:1) were expressed by using Clontech’s pEGFP - C1 vector by replacing the coding region of EGFP with respective cDNAs . Deletion mutants were constructed by PCR - mediated method and expressed by using pCMV - myc expression vector ( Clontech ) . For CaMKII (cid:2) and (cid:1) RNAi constructs , the following sequences were chosen as target sequence : for CaMKII (cid:2) ; 5 (cid:6) - CCACTACCT - TATCTTCGAT - 3 (cid:6) ; for CaMKII (cid:1) ; 5 (cid:6) - GAGTATGCAGCTAA - GATCA - 3 (cid:6) . The shRNAs were expressed by using a plasmid - based expression vector , pSuper , and their effectiveness and specificity were confirmed by cotransfecting them with GFP - tagged CaMKII subunits in Cos7 cells ( 12 ) and immunoblotting with anti - GFP antibody ( Fig . 3 a ) . To rescue the phenotype observed with RNAi experiments , CaMKII (cid:1) cDNA was made resistant to RNAi by incorporating five mismatched silent mutations at the shRNA target region ( indicated as CaMKII (cid:1) R ) . The resistance of CaMKII (cid:1) R cDNA to RNAi was confirmed by Western blotting . Actin - Bundling Assay . Non - muscle actin ( Cytoskeleton ) was poly - merized in F - actin buffer containing 10 mM Tris (cid:1) HCl , 0 . 2 mM DTT , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 50 mM KCl , and 0 . 5 mM ATP , pH 7 . 5 . The purified CaMKII [ for additional information , see supporting information ( SI ) Methods ] , precentrifuged to remove large aggregates , or elution buffer without 2 mM EGTA was added . After incubation at room temperature ( homomeric CaMKII (cid:2) or - (cid:1) ) or on ice ( heteromeric CaMKII (cid:2) and (cid:1) ) for 30 min , the mixture was centrifuged at 10 , 000 (cid:3) g for 10 min to sediment bundled F - actin but not linear , unbundled F - actin ( 21 ) . The pellet and supernatant were subjected to SDS / PAGE and the gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue ( CBB ) . To estimate binding affinity , Fig . 6 .

The CBB - stained gels were scanned , and the band intensities were measured by using Metamorph ( Molecular Devices ) . Electron Microscopy . Actin and CaMKII were allowed to react for 30 min as described in F - actin - bundling assay . The reaction mixture was adsorbed onto freshly glow - discharged , carbon - coated copper grids for 30 s and the excess sample was removed by wicking with filter paper . The bound particles were stained with 2 % uranyl acetate for 30 s , and the excess stain was removed with filter paper . Images were recorded on a slow - scan CCD camera with a JEOL electron microscope operating at 200 kV at a magnification of 15 , 000 . Actin Assembly and Disassembly . In vitro actin assembly and disas - sembly were performed as in Sagot et al . ( 22 ) . Actin polymerization was monitored by the increase in fluorescence of 5 % pyrenyl - labeled nonskeletal muscle actin ( Cytoskeleton ) . Nonskeletal mus - cle actin ( 50 (cid:3) M ) in G - buffer ( 10 mM Tris (cid:1) HCl / 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 / 0 . 2 mM DTT / 0 . 2 mM ATP , pH 7 . 5 ) was thawed overnight at 4°C , diluted to 22 . 5 (cid:3) M in G - buffer and precleared by centrifugation at 200 , 000 (cid:3) g for 60 min at 4°C . Actin ( 2 (cid:3) M ) was mixed with 2 (cid:3) M CaMKII (cid:1) and the reaction was initiated by transfer to a quartz fluorometer cuvette ( 3 - mm light path ) containing 20 (cid:3) initiation mix ( 40 mM MgCl 2 / 1 M KCl / 10 mM ATP ) . Pyrene fluorescence was recorded at 407 nm with an excitation at 365 nm at room temperature . The amounts of sedimentable F - actin at 100 , 000 (cid:3) g were similar in the presence or absence of CaMKII (cid:1) ( data not shown ) . For actin disassembly assays , 2 (cid:3) M CaMKII (cid:1) was incu - bated for 5 min in the presence of preassembled actin filaments ( 2 (cid:3) M ) . Baseline was adjusted to zero and the increase in fluorescence was plotted . Disassembly was induced by dilution in F - buffer ( G - buffer containing 1 (cid:3) initiation mix ) to a final concentration of 0 . 2 (cid:3) M . The initial F - actin fluorescence at the beginning of the reaction was used as 100 % to plot the disassembly reaction . CaMKII Activation . CaMKII was stimulated in a buffer containing 40 mM Hepes , 1 mM Mg - acetate , 0 . 1 mM EGTA , 0 . 2 mM Ca 2 (cid:1) , 50 (cid:3) M ATP , and 10 (cid:3) M ( for Fig . 5 b ) or 1 (cid:3) M ( others ) calmodulin ( 35 ) . The reaction was started by adding calmodulin and stopped by adding 1 mM EGTA at the indicated time after start . Phosphory - lation of CaMKII in the presence or absence of F - actin during kinase reaction did not change the sedimentation characteristics of CaMKII . Neuronal Imaging . Organotypic slice cultures of hippocampus were prepared from postnatal day 6 – 8 rats as described ( 5 , 7 , 12 ) . They were biolistically transfected at days in vitro ( DIV ) 7 days ( for experiment described in Fig . 3 ) or DIV 4 days ( for Fig . 4 ) , and the imaging experiments were carried out from CA1 pyramidal neu - rons 4 days ( for Fig . 3 ) or 3 – 5 days after the transfection ( for Fig . 4 ) . For RNAi experiment , the expression vectors of GFP and shRNA were transfected at 1 : 5 ratio ; for rescue experiments , the expression vectors for GFP , RNAi , and the original or resistant cDNA of CaMKII (cid:1) were transfected at 1 : 5 : 5 ratio ; for FRAP experiments , GFP - actin and untagged CaMKII were transfected at a ratio of 1 : 5 . Neurons were imaged with a custom - made two - photon microscope 3 – 5 days after transfection in a solution con - taining119mMNaCl , 2 . 5mMKCl , 4mMCaCl 2 , 4mMMgCl 2 , 26 . 2 mM NaHCO 3 , 1 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , and 11 mM glucose , pH 7 . 4 , and gassed with 95 % O 2 and 5 % CO 2 ( 12 ) . GFP was imaged at 860 nm ( excitation ) and 570 nm short - pass ( emission ) . For analyses , image stacks typically composed of 15 – 20 sections taken at 0 . 5 - (cid:3) m intervals were z - projected ( summation ) , median - filtered , and back - ground - subtracted by using Metamorph . For FRAP experiments , photobleaching was achieved by scanning a spine of interest at maximal excitation power ( (cid:2) 1 . 4 W of Ti - sapphire laser output ) 10 times . The FRAP data were analyzed as described ( 12 ) . For morphological analyses , dendritic spines separated well from den - dritic shaft by at least 0 . 75 (cid:3) m from the edge of the dendritic shaft were chosen . To measure the size of spine heads , the fluorescence profile across a line drawn on spines , and adjacent dendritic shafts were measured in (cid:3) 10 zoomed images ; the ratio of fluorescent peaks of spine head and dendritic shaft were obtained as an index of spine head size . To normalize the thickness of dendritic shafts , the images were obtained at a consistent distance from the soma . Spine length was defined as the distance from the edge of the dendritic shaft to the tip of the spine . Spine density was obtained from 5 x zoomed images . All analyses were done blind to the DNA construct used . Results are reported as mean (cid:4) SEM . Statistical significance was determined by using Dunnett’s test ( 37 ) and defined at P (cid:5) 0 . 05 . We thank Drs . Mariko Hayashi , Avital Rodal , Atsuhiko Ishida , Bernardo Sabatini , J .
