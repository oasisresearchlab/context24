Aiming to replicate a com - parable degree of control , here we introduce DNA - Origami Line - Actants ( DOLAs ) as syn - thetic analogues of membrane - sculpting pro - teins . DOLAs are designed to selectively accu - mulate at the line - interface between co - existing domains in phase - separated lipid membranes , modulating the tendency of the domains to co - alesce . With experiments and coarse - grained simulations , we demonstrate that DOLAs can reversibly stabilise two - dimensional analogues of Pickering emulsions on synthetic giant lipo - somes , enabling dynamic programming of mem - brane lateral organisation . The control afforded over membrane structure by DOLAs extends to three - dimensional morphology , as exemplified by a proof - of - concept synthetic pathway lead - ing to vesicle fission . With DOLAs we lay the foundations for mimicking , in synthetic sys - tems , some of the critical membrane - hosted functionalities of biological cells , including sig - nalling , trafficking , sensing , and division . Introduction Biological membranes coordinate numerous pathways critical to life , from trafficking to sig - nal transduction and cellular motility , 1 many of which rely on regulating the distribution and interactions of membrane machinery . Among other regulatory principles , cells are believed to exploit membrane phase separation and critical composition fluctuations to dynamically gener - ate local heterogeneity . 2 – 10 Cell membranes are also known to contain inclusions that can accu - mulate at the line - interface between co - existing lipid domains , 11 – 15 and relax the associated line tension . 16 – 18 It has been proposed that cells use these line - actants as an additional means to dy - namically control membrane phase behaviour and the lateral organisation of membrane inclu - sions 19 underpinning , for instance , the function 1 of signalling hubs 20 , 21 and the generation of endo / exosomes . 22 , 23 Artificial cell science aims to construct , from the bottom - up , synthetic analogues of biolog - ical cells that mimic their sophisticated be - haviours , 24 , 25 and are expected to widely im - pact next generation diagnostics , therapeu - tics and bioprocessing . 26 – 28 Often constructed from lipid bilayers , 29 synthetic - cell membranes have been engineered to replicate an array of biomimetic responses , 30 including mechan - otransduction , 31 energy conversion , 32 – 34 and membrane deformation . 35 In parallel to solutions relying on reconsti - tuted membrane proteins , 32 – 34 fully synthetic DNA nano - devices , 36 anchored to the bilayers by means of hydrophobic tags , have emerged as a versatile toolkit for bio - membrane en - gineering , 37 – 39 having enabled the design of biomimetic pathways for transport , 40 – 43 traf - ficking , 44 , 45 cell adhesion , 46 , 47 tissue forma - tion , 48 – 50 signal detection , 51 membrane remod - elling , 52 – 55 and surface patterning . 56 – 59 Despite these advances , the design of path - ways enabling systematic control over the lo - cal structure and composition of synthetic - cell membranes , to the same degree of what is af - forded by extant biological machinery , remains an elusive task . Here we introduce DNA - Origami Line - Actants ( DOLAs ) to control the formation , stability and three - dimensional morphology of lipid domains on synthetic bilayers . Leveraging the modularity of amphiphilic DNA nanotech - nology , 56 we designed DOLAs to selectively accumulate at the line - interface between co - existing domains on Giant Unilamellar Vesi - cles ( GUVs ) . Using a combination of experi - ments and coarse - grained simulations , we show that , similar to interfacial inclusions in three dimensions , DOLAs modulate the tendency of lipid domains to coalesce , stabilising two - dimensional analogues of Pickering emulsions . The devices can be de - activated upon expo - sure to a molecular stimulus , triggering domain coarsening and unlocking the sought dynamic control over lateral membrane organisation . Combined with osmotic unbalance , we demon - strate DOLAs can form the basis of a synthetic pathway leading to membrane budding - off and fission , exemplifying three - dimensional mor - phological control . Owing to their modular design and robust working principle , we argue that DOLAs could constitute a versatile toolkit for synthetic - cell membrane engineering , allowing us to take full advantage of the rich phenomenology of lipid phase separation and design ever - more ad - vanced membrane - hosted functionalities . Results and Discussion Engineering line - actants with DNA nanostructures Our design of choice for DNA line - actants , de - picted schematically in Fig . 1a , exploits the ver - satility of the Rothemund Rectangular Origami ( RRO ) as a “molecular breadboard” , with an array of regularly spaced binding sites . 61 – 64 The rectangular tiles ( Supplementary Fig . 1 and Supplementary Table 1 ) feature two sets of either 6 , 12 or 24 single - stranded ( ss ) DNA overhangs extended from the same face of the origami , as shown in Fig . 1b . The sticky ends , with sequence δ 1 ∗ or δ 2 ∗ , can respectively bind complementary overhangs on double - stranded ( ds ) DNA anchoring modules functionalised with two cholesterol moieties ( dC ) or a sin - gle tocopherol ( sT ) . 56 We have recently deter - mined that dC and sT modules display , respec - tively , thermodynamic preferences for accumu - lating within liquid - ordered ( L o ) and liquid - disordered ( L d ) domains of phase - separated membranes . Specifically , transporting a dC module from L d to L o produces a moder - ately favourable free - energy shift ( ∆ G dCp , L o ) of ∼ − 0 . 8 k B T , while sT has a stronger affinity for disordered domains ( ∆ G sTp , L o ≈ 1 . 9 k B T ) . 56 The two sets of dC and sT modules were distributed on opposite halves of the tiles , with spacing of ℓ ∼ 25 − 30 nm between the two distinct sets of anchors ( Fig . 1b ) . Because ℓ is comfortably greater than the estimated width of the bound - ary separating L o and L d phases , ( ξ ∼ 8 nm , 2 Figure 1 : DNA - Origami line - active agents enrich the line - interface of phase - separated GUVs . a Schematic representation of a multi - component lipid bilayer membrane composed of saturated and unsaturated lipids mixed with sterols , displaying liquid - ordered ( L o ) and liquid - disordered ( L d ) phase co - existence . The outer leaflet of the membrane is decorated with a DNA - Origami Line - Actant ( DOLA ) , where amphiphilic anchor - modules bearing single - tocopherol ( sT ) and double - cholesterol ( dC ) motifs enrich their preferred ( L d and L o , respectively ) phases , driving accumulation of the DOLA at the L d − L o interface . b Selected staples on the origami ( see Supple - mentary Table 2 ) were extended to include overhang domains δ 1 ∗ and δ 2 ∗ , with complementarity to dC ( blue ) or sT ( red ) anchor modules , respectively ( Supplementary Tables 3 and 4 ) . Note that tiles are expected to have all of their δ 1 and δ 2 overhangs saturated with sT and dC anchoring modules , owing to the strong affinity between overhangs ( see Supplementary Note III ) . We also expect partially bound states , in which tiles are linked to the membrane through a sub - set of the available anchors , to be thermodynamically unlikely . c Hexagonal grids depict the arrangement of staples across the origami plates , where each hexagon corresponds to the 3’ terminus of a staple . We positioned sets of 6 × ( light pink ) , 12 × ( pink ) , or 24 × ( magenta ) overhangs targeting the same type of anchor - points . The two sets of anchors are separated by a distance ℓ ∼ 30 nm ( 6 × and 12 × ) or ℓ ∼ 25 nm ( 24 × ) . d ( Top ) Schematic represen - tation a de - mixed GUV where the L d − L o interface is enriched with DOLAs .

Scale bars = 10 µ m . Supplementary Note I ) , free - energy minimisa - tion is expected to drive the accumulation of the tiles across line - interfaces , accommodating each set of anchors in their respective preferred phase ( Fig . 1a ) . We produced three DOLA de - signs , with either 6 × , 12 × or 24 × anchors of each type , expecting an increase in the free - energy gain associated to line - accumulation for larger number of anchors ( Fig . 1c ) . DOLAs were further labelled with fluorescent ( Alexa488 ) beacons , located on the face oppo - site to that hosting the anchors ( Supplementary Fig . 2 and Supplementary Table 5 ) , thus allow - ing us to monitor their distribution by means of confocal microscropy . Accumulation of the three DOLA designs at the L d – L o line - interface in phase - separated GUVs ( DOPC / DPPC / Chol 2 : 2 : 1 ) is demonstrated in Fig . 1d with confo - cal 3D reconstructions , where the equatorial boundary separating the two hemispherical do - mains is clearly delineated by the fluorescent plates . 3 Figure 2 : Line - accumulation of DOLAs is regu - lated by the number of anchors . a Schematic de - piction of a de - mixed lipid membrane decorated with DOLAs , where fluorescent Alexa488 beacons enable the quantification of origami distribution from fluo - rescence intensity profiles ( Supplementary Note II ) . b Line - interface accumulation conveyed as average fluo - rescence intensity ± standard deviation for line inter - faces decorated with 6 × , 12 × , or 24 × DOLAs ( sampled interfaces n = 12 , 10 and 10 , respectively ) . The profiles , as a function of distance from the line - interface ( x = 0 ) , have been normalised to the mean L d - phase intensity . Red dashed lines are fits to Eq . S2 ( Supplementary Note II ) , which models the experimental , diffraction - blurred , fluorescence intensity profile . c Line - partitioning coef - ficients ( K p , int ) of DOLAs featuring sets of either 6 × , 12 × , or 24 × dC / sT anchor - points . d Fraction of line - interface occupied ( ϕ ) by 6 × , 12 × , or 24 × line - actants , computed using the experimental K p , int in our numeri - cal line - adsorption model ( see Supplementary Note III and Supplementary Figs . 5 , 6 , 7 , and 8 . ) A custom - built image segmentation routine , detailed in Supplementary Note II and Supple - mentary Fig . 4 , was applied to confocal data to sample the DOLAs fluorescence - intensity pro - file across line - interfaces , as sketched in Fig . 2a . The resulting curves , shown in Fig . 2b , dis - play clear peaks at the L d – L o boundary loca - tion ( x = 0 ) , confirming line - accumulation . As detailed in Supplementary Note II , fitting of the diffraction - limited fluorescent peak and base - line signals from the surrounding L d and L o re - gions allowed us to estimate a line - partitioning coefficient K p , int , defined as the ratio between the surface density of origami at the line - interface and the average origami surface den - sity on the entire GUV . Figure 2c summarises the experimentally de - termined K p , int for the three tested designs , ren - dering similar results for the 12 × and 24 × tiles , with a slightly larger value for the 6 × vari - ant . Line - interface adsorption models , outlined in Supplementary Note III ( see associated Sup - plementary Fig . 5 and Supplementary Tables 6 , 7 , and 8 ) , enable the estimation of K p , int for the three DOLA designs . We fitted the theoretical estimates to experimentally - determined K p , int values , using the overall surface coverage of the origami on the GUVs , σ , as fitting parameter . The obtained estimates of 1 . 5 < σ 12 × theory < 9 . 3 % and 2 . 9 < σ 24 × theory < 14 . 4 % for 12 × and 24 × , re - spectively , are in good agreement with the nom - inal experimental surface coverage σ exp ∼ 5 % ( Supplementary Fig . 6 ) . For the 6 × design , we estimated σ 6 × theory < 3 . 2 % , slightly below the nominal experimental value and reflecting the larger observed K p , int and the smaller abso - lute fluorescence - intensity values ( see Supple - mentary Note III and Supplementary Fig . 7 ) . A smaller than expected σ is likely the result of a decreased membrane - affinity , consistent with the smaller number anchor - points available for the 6 × tiles . It should further be noted that RRO tiles are prone to bending in the direc - tion orthogonal to that of the double helices , 65 possibly leading to thermal fluctuations in cur - vature while tiles are in the bulk . These fluctu - ations would be suppressed upon confining the tiles to the membrane , which would carry an entropic penalty to tile - membrane binding . It 4 is natural to expect that anchoring overhangs may limit the amplitude of shape fluctuations in the bulk , implying that designs with a higher number of anchoring points , i . e . 24 × and 12 × , would be less affected by the confinement en - tropic penalty compared to the ( arguably ) more flexible 6 × design . Possible differences in spon - taneous ( equilibrium ) curvature of the tile de - signs 66 may also impact membrane - tile affinity . Fitted line - adsorption models allowed us to estimate the fraction of the line - interface oc - cupied by DOLAs , ϕ ( defined in Supplemen - tary Note III ; see Supplementary Fig . 5 ) , sum - marised in Fig . 2d . Expectedly , we note an increase in ϕ with increasing number of an - chors , with the strongly - binding 24 × approach - ing saturation and the 6 × leaving much of the line unoccupied , hence demonstrating control over the degree of line - accumulation by design . Note that the uncertainties in the estimate of the line - interface width ξ propagate to the val - ues obtained for K p , int ( see Supplementary Note III ) . As demonstrated in Supplementary Fig . 8 , however , relative trends with respect to tile de - sign are robust , while changes to the values of ϕ are negligible . DOLAs stabilise two - dimensional Pickering emulsions Having demonstrated that DOLAs can pro - grammably accumulate at the boundary be - tween co - existing lipid phases , we sought to verify whether accumulation leads to stabilisa - tion of the line - interface , as hypothesised for biological line - actants . 14 To this end , we dec - orated the phase - separating GUVs with 12 × DOLAs at a nominal surface coverage of ∼ 30 % , further promoting line - interface satura - tion ( ϕ ∼ 0 . 75 − 0 . 87 ) . The GUVs , fluorescently labelled with L d - partitioning TexasRed - DHPE for ease of visualisation , were heated to ∼ 37 ◦ C , well above their miscibility transition tempera - ture of T m ∼ 33 ± 1 ◦ C , 68 to induce lipid mix - ing . After incubating at high temperature for ∼ 5 minutes , the sample was quenched back to room temperature ( T = 25 ◦ C ) , leading to the nucleation of L o or L d domains in a background of the opposite phase . In non - functionalised GUVs , domains rapidly coarsen until most vesicles display two quasi - hemispherical domains , resulting in Janus - like morphologies ( Fig . 3a , bottom ) . However , in DOLA - functionailsed GUVs , coalescence was arrested leading to morphologies with a large number of small , stable domains , analogous to two - dimensional Pickering emulsions ( Fig . 3a , top ) . To quantify the domain - stabilising ability of DOLAs , we analysed epifluorescence micro - graphs collected ∼ 3 hrs after quenching , and extracted the fraction F of non - Janus vesicles , namely those that failed to relax into the two - domain morphology . Results , summarised in Fig . 3b , clearly demonstrate how most line - actant decorated GUVs display Pickering mor - phologies ( Fig . 3a , top ) . In turn , the Janus morphology dominates when GUVs lack either dC or sT anchor modules , no tiles are included , or if the origami are prepared omitting the over - hangs to target either dC or sT . The latter con - trols confirm that domain stabilisation emerges solely thanks to line - interface accumulation of the rationally designed DOLAs , rather than as a result of non - specific effects associated to the individual membrane inclusions . As further confirmation that domain sta - bilisation is underpinned by interfacial ac - cumulation of the origami , vesicles lacking TexasRed - lipids and decorated with fluores - cent DOLAs were subjected to an analogous heating - cooling program and inspected with confocal microscopy . Besides detecting domain stabilisation , line - accumulation was confirmed at the boundaries of the stabilised lipid do - mains , as demonstrated in Fig . 3c with a 3D confocal reconstruction . Coarse grained simulations cap - ture DOLA line - accumulation and domain stabilisation To further validate our line - actant engineering strategy , we conducted Monte Carlo ( MC ) sim - ulations using a coarse - grained representation of the experimental system . As presented in Fig . 4a , and detailed in Supplementary Note IV , we defined a two - dimensional Ising model 5 Figure 3 : DOLAs stabilise two - dimensional analogues of Pickering emulsions . a Representative epiflu - orescence micrographs of de - mixed GUVs showing : ( top ) stable lipid domains ≈ 3 hours after phase separation in the presence of 12 × DOLAs ; ( bottom ) GUV lacking line - actants that equilibrated to produce a Janus morphology with two quasi - hemispherical L d and L o domains . Fluorescent marker is Texas Red - DHPE , which partitions to the L d phase . b Programmable , domain - stabilising , activity of DOLAs as conveyed by the fraction , F , of GUVs exhibiting more than two domains with respect to that of Janus vesicles . As shown in the graphical legend , besides the complete DOLAs ( n = 363 GUVs ) , we exploited the modularity of the platform to produce various control functionalisation schemes expected to lack line - active behaviour , including omitting either sT ( n = 97 GUVs ) or dC ( n = 187 GUVs ) modules , using tiles that lack overhangs targeting sT ( n = 125 GUVs ) or dC ( n = 165 GUVs ) , and omitting tiles altogether ( n = 160 GUVs ) . c Line - accumulation of DOLAs scaffolds lipid domains and confers them with stability against coalescence , as shown with a 3D view of a reconstructed vesicle after heating above and quenching below the miscibility transition temperature . Interfacial accumulation of fluorescent ( Alexa488 ) 12 × DOLAs readily shows stable domains rendered from a representative confocal z - stack using Volume Viewer ( FIJI 60 ) with contrast enhancement ( see Supplementary Fig . 9 for reconstructions without contrast enhancement ) . All scale bars = 10 µ m . on a triangular lattice , which displays phase co - existence at sufficiently low temperature . We interpret the phase rich in spin s = 1 ( green ) as L d , and that rich in s = − 1 ( blue ) as L o . Rectangular tiles were included with anchor - points arranged on the lattice according to their nominal position on the DOLAs . Interaction free - energies between dC / sT anchors and their lipid micro - environment were modelled in the system’s Hamiltonian as J dC · ˜ s and J sT · ˜ s , re - spectively , where ˜ s is the sum of the spins over the lattice site hosting the anchor and its six nearest neighbours ( ˜ s ∈ [ − 7 , − 5 , . . . , 5 , 7 ] ) . The anchor - coupling constant values were chosen as J sT = 0 . 136 k B T and J dC = − 0 . 057 k B T , reflect - ing the experimentally - determined partitioning free - energies of the modules ( see Supplemen - tary Note IV and ref . 56 ) . To replicate the experimental protocol , we prepared high - temperature systems with uni - form spin ( and tile ) distributions , before quenching to a lower temperature at which de - mixing occurs . The quenching temperature was chosen to replicate the experimental line ten - sion of ∼ 1 pN 67 ( see Supplementary Note IV ) . The system was simulated with Kawasaki dy - namics , 69 conserving the number of s = − 1 and s = 1 spins , initially set to a ratio of 2 / 3 . The tiles , present at a surface coverage σ = 30 % , readily localised at the boundaries of the blue domains emerging after quenching , leading to their stabilisation , ( see Fig . 4b and Supple - mentary Movie 1 ) . Figure 4c compares the time - evolution of systems featuring and lacking 12 × tiles . When tiles were present , coarsen - ing was slowed down and small domains per - sisted at long simulation times ( t MC = 2 × 10 7 steps ) . Conversely , over the same time window , the system lacking the tiles achieved complete coarsening , resulting in a morphology with one domain of each phase , analogous to the Janus GUVs ( Supplementary Movies 2 and 3 , re - 6 Figure 4 : Coarse - grained simulations replicate DOLA line - accumulation and domain stabilisation . a Representation of the developed Ising model with hexagonal unit cells carrying spins of s = 1 ( green ) and s = − 1 ( blue ) . Neighbouring spins interact through a coupling parameter J = 0 . 55 k B T , chosen to roughly replicate the expected experimental line tension ∼ 1 pN . 67 Anchor - points on the tiles are arranged based on the 12 × DOLA design . Each anchor is located at an Ising lattice point and contributes with a free - energy term J x (cid:80) 7 i = 1 s i , where s i indicates the spins of the lattice point hosting the anchor and the 6 nearest neighbors , and J x is a coupling constant taking different values for sT ( J sT = 0 . 136 k B T ) and dC ( J dC = − 0 . 057 k B T ) to account for the different partitioning tendencies . b Representative snapshot of a simulation trajectory after t MC = 2 ( × 10 7 MC cycles ) , where tiles stabilise blue domains by accumulating at their boundary .

Supplementary Fig . 10 compares frequency histograms of the number of domains in 15 runs at various t MC , confirming the abil - ity of the tiles to slow down domain coarsening , in line with experimental findings outlined in Fig . 3 . Despite its coarse - grained nature , simulations offer insights on the different mechanisms lead - ing to domain coarsening , and on how these are influenced by the presence of DOLAs . Gener - ally , we observed coarsening followed two dis - tinct pathways : domain coalescence and Ost - wald ripening . 70 Simulations suggest that the presence of tiles slows down the former mecha - nism , by offering a steric barrier that prevents the interfaces of two distinct domains from com - 7 Figure 5 : Toehold - mediated strand displacement enables dynamic control over membrane lateral organisation via DOLA reconfiguration . a Schematic depiction of anchor - points in DOLAs , highlighting the toehold domain linked to the dC - targeting overhangs .

Points connected by lines are relative to the same GUV . ing in sufficient proximity and undergo coales - cence . Instead , Ostwald ripening , supported by the exchange of particles ( spins ) between domains via diffusion through the background phase , occurs regardless of the presence of tiles . This second coarsening process is solely respon - sible for the decrease in total line - length ob - served in the presence of tiles at very long sim - ulation times ( Fig . 4d , inset ) , when no fur - ther domain coalescence is observed . In exper - iments , tile - decorated GUVs display stable 2D Pickering emulsions ∼ 3 hours after quenching , when most non - functinonalised vesicles have fully equilibrated ( Fig . 3b ) , hinting that do - main coalescence may be the primary mecha - nism leading to coarsening , with Ostwald ripen - ing playing a comparatively minor role . Figure 4d compares the simulated time - evolution of the overall line - interface length ( L ) for systems featuring each DOLA design with those lacking tiles . At late simulation times , the interface length is higher for 24 × , followed by 12 × and 6 × , with the latter design showing val - ues identical to the tile - less control , confirming the expected link between number of anchors and line - stabilising ability . See also Supplemen - tary Fig . 11 and the associated Supplementary Movies 4 and 5 for representative simulation runs with 24 × and 6 × DOLAs . Consistently , as shown in Fig . 4e , the simu - lated tile - occupied fraction of the line ( ϕ ) con - verges to values that monotonically increase with the number of anchors , in agreement with the experimental / theoretical findings outlined in Fig . 2d . Analogous trends are noted when monitoring the time - dependent fraction of tiles at the line - interface , found to increase with anchor - point number ( Supplementary Fig . 13 ) . Further insights can be gathered from Fig . 4f , where we plot the fraction of tiles at the line as a function of interface length . We note that , as L decreases due to domain coarsening , strongly binding 24 × tiles remain more persis - tently pinned at the interface , while 6 × tiles are readily expelled . Finally , in Fig . 4g , we ex - plicitly explore the correlation between ϕ and line length . As L shrinks , a plateau in ϕ is approached for 6 × tiles able to readily desorb 8 from the line , while a correlation is retained for strongly - pinned 24 × DOLAs . Fueling lipid domain re - organisation with dynamic DNA line - actants The ability of DOLAs to regulate domain coars - ening can be readily coupled to nanostructure re - configurability afforded by toeholding reac - tions , 71 – 73 thus enabling dynamic control over membrane lateral organisation . To demon - strate this functionality , 12 × line - actants were modified with a 6 - nt toehold domain of se - quence α on the 3’ - end of cholesterol - targeting overhangs ( see Supplementary Table 9 ) . As depicted schematically in Fig . 5a , a chemical Fuel , in the form of an oligonucleotide with se - quence α ∗ δ 2 , can selectively displace the dC - anchoring modules from the tile through a toe - holding reaction ( see Supplementary Fig . 14 for an agarose gel confirming the sought molecu - lar response ) . When removing the dC anchors , DOLAs are expected to lose their line - interface affinity and instead partition to L d driven by the remaining sT moieties , negating the ability of the tiles to stabilise lipid domains . As sketched in Fig . 5b ( left ) , and shown in Fig . 5c ( left ) with fluorescence micrographs , GUVs decorated with the responsive 12 × tiles form stable 2D emulsions when subjected to the heating - cooling cycle outlined above . Fig - ures 5b – c ( centre and right ) show domain coarsening triggered by exposure to the Fuel strand , which translates into a clear decrease in the fraction F of non - Janus GUVs , shown in Fig . 5d . The series of snapshots in Fig . 5c shows that , while some GUVs acquire a Janus morphology after Fuel exposure ( top ) , others retain a larger number of domains . Nonethe - less , all observed GUVs experience a substan - tial degree of domain coarsening , as outlined in Fig . 5e where we track changes in the number of domains following Fuel addition in individ - ual GUVs . As exemplified in Supplementary Fig . 15 , domains often bulge after fuel addition , possibly due to a slight osmolarity mismatch coupled with differences in spontaneous curva - ture between the phases . Bulging may in turn be responsible for enhancing stability against coalescence of the domains after line - actant de - activation , preventing some GUVs from re - laxing into the Janus configuration . 74 Responsive DOLAs for domain fis - sion in synthetic membranes Reversible domain stabilisation with DOLAs can be exploited to synthetically replicate the action of biological membrane - remodelling machinery , tackling a critical bottleneck in synthetic - cell engineering . 75 For instance , phos - pholipase A 2 has been postulated to exhibit en - hanced catalytic activity at line - interfaces be - tween co - existing L d – L o phases , driving do - main budding and fission . 76 We propose our line - actants could form the basis of an analo - gous pathway coordinating fission and , there - fore , three - dimensional membrane transforma - tion . We prepared GUVs in an initial configura - tion featuring DOLA - stabilised micro - domains , as outlined above . We then applied an hyper - osmotic shock by increasing the osmolarity of the outside solution ( C O ) to ∼ 1 . 28 × C I , where C I is the internal vesicle osmolarity , thus leading to an increase in GUV excess area . 77 While in some cases hyperosmosis led to mem - brane internalisation ( Supplementary Fig . 16 ) , some domains responded by bulging - out , as de - picted in Fig . 6a and experimentally observed in Fig . 6b . At this stage , some bulged - out do - mains could be “primed” for complete budding - off or fission , driven by minimisation of line - interface energy and opposed by membrane fluctuation entropy 78 and , possibly , steric re - pulsion between DOLAs preventing line shrink - age . De - activation of the line - actants through Fuel strand addition is expected to increase line tension and negate any steric hinderance to in - terface shrinkage , tipping the marginally sta - ble domains into full budding off and fission , ( Fig . 6c , top ) . Fission events can be promptly recorded experimentally upon Fuel - strand ad - dition , as shown in Supplementary Movie 6 and Fig . 6c ( bottom ) . The sequence of epi - fluorescence images in the latter clearly shows the dark region corresponding to a budding L o - 9 Figure 6 : Biomimetic fission pathway mediated by DOLAs .

Fluorescent marker is Texas Red - DHPE , which partitions to the L d phase . All scale bar = 10 µ m . domain shrinking progressively , and ultimately disappearing . Vesicle fission is confirmed with brightfield micrographs , where arrows highlight both the “parent” and “offspring” vesicles re - gaining spherical morphologies . An analogous example is provided in Fig . 6d , and the asso - ciated Supplementary Movie 7 , with overlaid confocal and bright - field micrographs . In further support of our proposed syn - thetic fission pathway , DOLA - functionalised li - posomes with stabilised micro - domains were gently added to imaging wells containing hyper - osmotic buffer baths with and without Fuel . In the former scenario , confocal microscopy revealed further examples of phase - separated GUVs found in proximity of a smaller single - phase vesicle ( Fig . 6e , left , and Supplemen - tary Fig . 17 ) , similar to the confirmed fis - sion occurrences shown in Fig . 6c and d . In turn , we did not observe such presumed fis - sion events in vesicles immersed in baths lack - ing Fuel ( Fig . 6e , middle ) , where GUVs ap - peared more Janus - like , also in line with our findings on sample heterogeneity summarised in Supplementary Fig . 16 . Finally , DOLA - lacking GUVs , immersed in Fuel - supplemented hyper - osmotic buffer , simply adopted dumb - bell shapes thanks to their Janus - morphology 10 ( Fig . 6e , right ) , consistent with the expectation that the used C O / C I is insufficient to drive fis - sion of quasi - hemispherical domains . 79 Conclusions and Outlook In summary , we presented DNA origami nanos - tructures – dubbed DOLAs – designed ratio - nally to accumulate at the one - dimensional line - interface between lipid domains , imitating bi - ological line - active membrane inclusions . The synthetic line - actants exploit the programma - bility and modularity of DNA origami , com - bined with the natural tendency of cholesterol and tocopherol “anchors” to enrich distinct lipid phases . Through experiments and numeri - cal modelling , we demonstrated that the affinity for line - interfaces can be programmed by tuning the number of hydrophobic anchors , thus out - lining a general design principle readily appli - cable to different origami designs , hydrophobic groups , or membrane compositions . We further demonstrated that our line - actants are able to stabilise small lipid domains against coarsen - ing , giving rise to two - dimensional analogues of Pickering emulsions on the surface of giant lipo - somes , and achieving a previously unattainable degree of control over the lateral organisation of synthetic bilayers . The nano - devices can be externally de - activated through a toehold - mediated strand displacement operation , triggering domain co - alescence . Coarse - grained Monte - Carlo simu - lations replicate the experimental phenomenol - ogy , identifying origami - origami steric repul - sion as the primary mechanism leading to domain stabilisation , and ultimately validat - ing our line - actant engineering strategy . Fi - nally , we combined externally - triggered line - actant de - activation with osmotic unbalance to implement a proof - of - concept synthetic fis - sion pathway , whereby offspring liposomes programmably bud - off from parent vesicles , demonstrating the ability of the nano - devices to promote large - scale membrane re - structuring similar to biological nano - machines . 23 , 80 , 81 The simplicity and modularity of the mech - anism underpinning line - action in our devices points at possible design variations that ex - ploit different origami geometries , anchor chem - istry , and polymerisation approaches to further program the number , size and morphology of lipid domains , marking a conceptual shift in synthetic - membrane engineering . Responsive - ness to a wider range of physical and chem - ical stimuli can also be achieved by incorpo - rating active elements such as DNAzymes , 82 G - quadruplexes , 83 aptamers , 84 and / or photo - actuable moieties ( e . g . azobenzene ) , 85 thus broadening the design space and applicability of synthetic membrane - restructuring pathways . Thanks to their ability to program mem - brane re - structuring and the lateral distribution of membrane inclusions , the DOLAs consti - tute a valuable toolkit in synthetic - cell science that could underpin elusive and highly sough - after behaviours such as synthetic - cell division , vesicle - based trafficking and signal transduction pathways , ultimately unlocking disruptive ap - plications to advance therapeutics and diagnos - tics . Finally , DOLAs could be used to exert con - trol over the local domain structure of living - cell membranes . One could thus envisage ap - plying the origami line - actant toolkit as the ba - sis of biophysical studies aimed at clarifying the role of micro - phase separation in cell signalling , by triggering the formation and disruption of “lipid rafts” at will . 20 If strong correlations be - tween disease - related pathways and membrane - domain structure are established , the origami line - actants could carry potential therapeutic value by unlocking a previously unattainable strategy for conditioning cell behaviour .
