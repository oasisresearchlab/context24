Several membrane - binding proteins recognize not only the chemical structure of the membrane lipids but the curvature of the surface , binding more strongly to more highly curved surfaces . One common mechanism of curvature sensing is through the insertion of an amphipathic helix into the outer membrane leaflet . Because lipid composition affects multiple material properties of the membrane including bending rigidity , thickness , lipid tilt , and compressibility , it has not been possible to predict how lipid composition controls protein curvature sensing by helix insertion . Here we develop and apply a two - leaflet continuum membrane model to quantify how such changes to the material properties can favor or disfavor protein curvature sensing by computing energetic and structural changes upon helix insertion , with corroboration against in vitro experiments . Our membrane model builds on previous work from our group to explicitly model both monolayers of the bilayer via representation by continuous triangular meshes . To the energy of each monolayer , we introduce a coupling energy that is derived from established energetics of lipid tilt but reformulated into a height term that is methodologically simpler to evaluate . In agreement with molecular dynamics simulations , our model produces a decrease in bilayer height around the site of insertion . We find that increasing membrane height increases curvature sensing . From the protein perspective , deeper or larger insertions also increase curvature sensing . Our experiments of helix insertion by the epsin N - terminal homology ( ENTH ) on vesicles with varying lipid tail groups show that lipids like DOPC drive stronger curvature sensing than DLPC , despite having the same head - group chemistry , confirming how the material properties of the membrane alter curvature sensing , in excellent agreement with the predictions of our bilayer membrane model . Our model thus quantitatively predicts how changes to membrane composition can alter membrane energetics driven by protein insertion , and can be more broadly extended to characterizing the structure and energetics of protein - driven membrane reshaping by protein assemblies . 3 Introduction Cytoplasmic proteins that bind biological membranes are essential for membrane remodeling pathways like clathrin - mediated endocytosis [ 1 , 2 ] and cell division [ 3 ] . Protein domains that mediate membrane binding are often classified by their recognition of specific lipid head groups such as for PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding . However , experimental studies have shown how multiple membrane binding domains can also recognize membrane curvature , including the epsin N - terminal homology ( ENTH ) domain , the bin - amphiphysin - rvs ( BAR ) domain [ 4 ] , and septins [ 3 ] . For the ENTH domain , this curvature ‘sensing’ ability stems from its N - terminal amphipathic helix , which inserts into the outer leaflet of the bilayer , generating asymmetry between the top and bottom leaflet [ 5 , 6 ] . Helix inserting domains like ENTH bind more strongly to more highly curved vesicles , and truncation of this helix effectively eliminates the curvature sensing ability [ 5 ] . These amphipathic , membrane - inserting helices are common to a variety of membrane binding proteins ( septins , arfGAP , amphiphysin ) , but they do not all exhibit the same curvature sensing abilities across experimental conditions . While this can in part stem from differences in the sequence or length of the helices [ 7 ] , the composition of the membrane also plays a role , as the insertion of the helix will locally perturb the membrane . Because changing the membrane lipid composition will influence multiple material properties of the membrane , including bending rigidity , thickness , and compressibility , it has not been possible to quantify how lipid composition impacts curvature sensing . Here we use a continuum membrane model that accounts for these material properties of the membrane to perform a quantitative analysis of curvature sensing with validation against new in vitro experiments using the ENTH domain . Computation and theory provide highly controlled and tunable methods to quantify the energetic and structural changes arising from helix insertion in membrane bilayers . However , tradeoffs in capturing molecular detail vs micron - scale membrane surfaces have thus far limited a quantitative comparison of lipid composition and membrane thickness on curvature sensing . At the molecular scale , molecular dynamics ( MD ) simulations have measured the distribution of membrane stress due to helix insertion [ 8 ] and shown how defects in the local ordering of the lipid membrane can regulate helix insertion [ 9 , 10 ] on flat membranes . On curved membranes , MD simulations characterized how helix insertions can orient along the membrane axis with lower curvature [ 11 ] , and can radially alter local lipid order [ 12 ] . Computational expense limits MD to the nanometer scale , preventing characterization at a range of curvature . Classic elasticity theory 4 allows a range of elastic moduli for evaluating solid - like deformations along the membrane thickness axis , applicable to nearly arbitrary lengthscales [ 13 ] while modeling the large local stresses resulting from helix insertion [ 14 ] . Previous work employed an efficient two - dimensional model , translationally invariant along a cylindrical axis , that could not account for the anisotropic membrane deformation around a finite helix . Continuum surface models that we use here ( e . g . , Helfrich - Canham - Evans , or HCE [ 15 - 17 ] ) sit at an intermediate or mesoscale resolution that is computationally much more efficient than MD simulations and more flexible than classical elasticity theory - based continuum models . While they lack the single - lipid resolution of molecular approaches , they can simultaneously measure energetic and structural changes of membranes in response to a range of perturbations at the micron scale [ 7 , 18 ] . By representing the surface in 3D space using points on a 2D triangular mesh , these models can capture realistic membrane shapes with arbitrary topologies [ 18 ] . In recent work we implemented such a thin - film continuum surface model that successfully predicted curvature sensing by helix insertion with excellent agreement to experiment , further quantifying how bending rigidity and helix size influenced curvature sensing [ 7 ] . However , this single - layer membrane lacks internal membrane structure , offering no way to vary the thickness of the bilayer or independently modulate the properties of the inner and outer leaflet . As a result , it has not been possible to evaluate how lipid composition and its material properties or asymmetry across the two leaflets alters curvature sensing , despite its significance in biological membranes [ 19 ] . For example , the plasma membrane is known to be actively maintained with a highly asymmetric composition , resulting in distinct curvature preferences and bending rigidities for the two leaflets [ 20 ] . Further , lipids with different tail groups are measured to have distinct tilt moduli [ 21 ] , which influences membrane thickness and how it responds to perturbation . Transmembrane proteins have a thickness that influences their partitioning within membranes of complex compositions , preferring to match their thickness to similarly sized bilayers to minimize their energy . We therefore developed here a double - layer continuum surface model that addresses these limitations of the single - layer model ( Fig 1 ) , capturing distinctions between the two leaflets and the role of membrane thickness in membrane structure and energetics . A key development for the double - leaflet continuum model is to incorporate the coupling between the two leaflets . Variations between leaflets can be modeled at a range of resolution . The curvature - inducing effect of differential stress [ 22 ] on an HCE surface can be captured with the 5 area - difference elasticity ( ADE ) model [ 23 , 24 ] . However , the ADE model assumes a uniform membrane thickness throughout the surface [ 23 ] , and thus cannot model local thickness changes induced by helix insertions . Alternatively , a dual - leaflet Helfrich model with the so - called Monge representation can be formulated to describe thickness [ 25 - 28 ] . However , this formulation is only applicable for relatively small deformations ; it cannot account for the highly localized deformation underneath the helix . Elasticity theory ( see for example Ref [ 29 ] ) resolves three dimensional structural changes , with local elastic constants that fully determine the bending , area / thickness , and tilt moduli of a tilt - augmented HCE model [ 30 - 33 ] . In this extended HCE model [ 30 - 33 ] , lipid orientations must be defined as vectors from the lipid tail to the lipid head . This requires a fixed definition of the start and end mesh points for a specific lipid to be able to calculate its tilt . We find a more flexible option is to reformulate this tilt energy by its impact on membrane height , or the distance between the two leaflets . We use the term height to indicate tilt , and to differentiate from thickness which is coupled to area . To elaborate , an important consideration is ensuring that membrane shape changes influencing area , curvature , and thickness are not ‘double - counted’ within the energy function . In particular , if the membrane is assumed to be incompressible , then the lateral stretching of the membrane area is equivalent to the vertical reduction in membrane thickness , and thus both thickness and area changes do not contribute independently to the membrane energy . We retain this assumption in our model . The tilt energy , however , is always evaluated independently of the area energy , and by converting tilt modulus into a height modulus , we retain two independent contributions to the energy but in the form of both an area and a height ( rather than tilt ) term . In this paper , we first describe our theoretical derivation of the coupled two - leaflet energy function based off of the area - difference - elasticity model [ 23 , 24 ] and the tilt - curvature augmented Helfrich model [ 30 - 32 ] , with the purpose of relaxing the uniform thickness approximation by adding in the tilt energy . In our derivation , we define a membrane height elasticity that is decoupled from the membrane area elasticity . Our height modulus derives from the tilt modulus . Our numerical implementation of the membrane surface builds from our one - layer surface [ 7 , 34 ] to introduce an outer mesh layer , an inner mesh layer , and the interface layer between the two monolayers , allowing for variations in the local leaflet height / tilt and material properties of each leaflet . We use feedback from MD simulations to validate the local height change introduced to the membrane by the helix insertion . With this model , we then characterize how changes to the 6 membrane height , tilt modulus , bending modulus , leaflet spontaneous curvature , leaflet asymmetry , and helix size quantitatively alter curvature sensing on vesicles of varying curvature . We performed in vitro experiments on vesicles with the same lipid head - group chemistry but varying tail groups , contrasting DOPC , DLPC , and DPPC . Using literature values for the material properties of these membranes , our model can predict how the strength of curvature sensing changes with lipid composition , in excellent agreement with the experiments . We discuss how our model provides a resource for predicting the energetics of protein - driven membrane remodeling , and our results provide a foundation for predicting how distinct membranes will impact protein recruitment as key material properties are varied . Figure 1 . The continuum membrane model is extended here to capture both leaflets of the membrane bilayer . In the middle panel , we illustrate a bilayer membrane consists of two lipid monolayers , with tail groups in orange and head groups in blue . The left panel shows a continuum membrane model using a single - layer triangular mesh , which represents the mid - surface of the bilayer membrane . This model accurately captures changes in membrane curvature and area elasticity . The right panel shows the new continuum membrane model with a triple - layer of triangular meshes . This new model simulates both monolayers simultaneously , allowing for the analysis of curvature changes and area elasticity in each monolayer , as well as the deformation of the leaflet height due to lipid tilt , and asymmetry in leaflet properties . 7 Theory of the bilayer membrane energy 1 . Background on expression for bilayer membrane energy Lipid bilayers are composed of two lipid monolayers or leaflets in contact via their hydrophobic tails . The energy of the bilayer membrane can be defined by the sum of the individual mechanical energies of the each monolayers , an energy due to the geometrical constraint between the two monolayers [ 23 ] , and any external work on the system . We thus define the total energy of the system as : 𝐸 = # 𝐸 ! " ! # $ + 𝐸 % + 𝐸 & , ( 1 ) where 𝐸 ! is the monolayer energy , and the index i = 1 , 2 refers to the inner and outer monolayer , respectively . 𝐸 % is the energy describing the coupling between the two monolayers which will be discussed below . For the enclosed membrane , like the vesicle membrane , the energy term 𝐸 & is incorporated to represent the restriction on the volume enclosed by the membrane , 𝐸 & = 1 2 𝜇 & ( 𝑉 − 𝑉 ’ ) " 𝑉 ’ , ( 2 ) where 𝜇 & is the coefficient of the volume constraint , and 𝑉 ’ is the equilibrium or target volume . The volume constraint is an equivalent description of the difference between the osmotic pressures inside and outside the vesicle [ 35 ] . Previous work found the volume constraint contributes minimally to the overall energetics given the stable difference between the osmotic pressure inside and outside the vesicle , even when perturbed by a - helix insertion [ 7 ] . For unenclosed or infinite membranes , such as cylindrical and planar membranes , there is no volume constraint or 𝐸 & term . The mechanical energy of the monolayer is given as the HCE Hamiltonian [ 15 , 16 , 23 ] , 𝐸 ! = . 1 2 𝜅 ! 02𝑐 ! − 𝑐 ’ , ! 2 " 𝑑𝐴 ’ , ! + 1 2 𝜇 ) , ! 0𝐴 ! − 𝐴 ’ , ! 2 " 𝐴 ’ , ! , ( 3 ) where 𝜅 ! is the bending modulus , 𝑐 ! is the mean curvature evaluated at each position on the surface , 𝑐 ’ , ! is the spontaneous curvature , 𝜇 ) , ! is the area elasticity modulus , 𝐴 ! is the area and 𝐴 ’ , ! is the equilibrium area . As above , the index i = 1 , 2 refers to the inner monolayer and outer monolayer , respectively . For simplicity , the two monolayers have the same lipid compositions and thus the same physical properties , i . e . 𝜅 $ = 𝜅 " , 𝜇 ) , $ = 𝜇 ) , " , and 𝑐 ’ , $ = −𝑐 ’ , " where the minus represents 8 that the two monolayers have opposite lipid orientation . Constants 𝜅 , 𝜇 ) , 𝑐 ’ represent the single leaflet ( mono bending modulus , area elasticity modulus and spontaneous curvature , respectively ) . 2 . Derivation of the monolayer equilibrium area Values of parameters in Eq ( 3 ) , namely 𝜅 , 𝜇 ) and 𝑐 ’ , only rely on the lipid composition and can be directly obtained from prior experimental data . However , the parameter , 𝐴 ’ , ! , cannot be directly determined through prior experiments . In this analysis , we establish a relationship between 𝐴 ’ , ! , the lipid composition , and the membrane geometry . Consider a bilayer membrane with monolayer height h , and a mid - surface with area 𝐴 * . Without external force , a flat membrane will reach equilibrium and its two monolayers will have equal areas , i . e . 𝐴 ! = 𝐴 ’ , ! = 𝐴 * . For a curved membrane , such as spherical or cylindrical membrane , we suppose it is generated in two steps . First , the flat membrane is bent into a curved shape with 𝐴 * fixed and the membrane height unchanged . Second , to relax the membrane compression on the inner layer and stretching on the outer layer due to their distinct radii , lipids flip from the inner monolayer to the outer monolayer [ 36 ] . We assume lipid flipping does not influence the membrane size 𝐴 * or the membrane height , but results in the decrease of the equilibrium area of the inner monolayer and increase of the equilibrium area of the outer monolayer . We introduce 𝛾 as the ratio of the number of inner lipids flipped to the outer monolayer relative to the total number of inner lipids . The equilibrium area of the inner monolayer and the outer monolayer can be expressed as 7𝐴 ’ , $ = ( 1 − 𝛾 ) 𝐴 * 𝐴 ’ , " = ( 1 + 𝛾 ) 𝐴 * , ( 4 ) Note the sum of the equilibrium areas of the two monolayers is independent of 𝛾 , 𝐴 ’ , $ + 𝐴 ’ , " = 2𝐴 * , preserving mass conservation . For a regularly shaped membrane like the sphere or cylinder , the curvature is uniform on the surface . The sum of the energy of the two monolayers is now 𝐸 $ + " = 1 2 𝜅 ( 2𝑐 $ − 𝑐 ’ ) " 𝐴 ’ , $ + 1 2 𝜇 ) 0𝐴 $ − 𝐴 ’ , $ 2 " 𝐴 ’ , $ + 1 2 𝜅 ( 2𝑐 " + 𝑐 ’ ) " 𝐴 ’ , " + 1 2 𝜇 ) 0𝐴 " − 𝐴 ’ , " 2 " 𝐴 ’ , " , ( 5 ) where we assumed both leaflets have the same material properties ( 𝜅 , 𝜇 ) and 𝑐 ’ ) . After relaxation due to lipid flipping , the curved membrane relaxes to the equilibrium state . The value of 𝛾 can be determined by minimizing the membrane energy , 9 𝜕𝐸 $ + " 𝜕𝛾 = 0 ( 6 ) to therefore define 𝐴 ’ , $ and 𝐴 ’ , " via Eq . 4 . The specific expression for 𝛾 depends on the membrane geometry . In the following sections , we will derive the expression for 𝛾 in the case of spherical , cylindrical , and planar membrane , respectively . 2 . 1 Spherical membrane For a spherical vesicle formed by this membrane , the sphere radius R is defined by the radius of the mid - surface , whose area is 𝐴 * = 4𝜋𝑅 " . The area of the inner monolayer is 𝐴 $ = 4𝜋 ( 𝑅 − ℎ ) " and the area of the outer monolayer is 𝐴 " = 4𝜋 ( 𝑅 + ℎ ) " . The mean curvature of the inner monolayer is 𝑐 $ = 1 / ( 𝑅 − ℎ ) and of the outer monolayer is 𝑐 " = 1 / ( 𝑅 + ℎ ) . By inserting these into Eq . 5 along with Eq . 4 , Eq . 6 then produces the expression : ( 𝑅 − ℎ ) , 𝑅 , ( 1 − 𝛾 ) " − ( 𝑅 + ℎ ) , 𝑅 , ( 1 + 𝛾 ) " = 𝜅 𝜇 ) AB 2 𝑅 − ℎ − 𝑐 ’ C " − B 2 𝑅 + ℎ + 𝑐 ’ C " D ( 7 ) Eq ( 7 ) shows that 𝛾 is dependent on the vesicle size 𝑅 , the monolayer height ℎ , lipid spontaneous curvature 𝑐 ’ , bending modulus 𝜅 and area elasticity modulus 𝜇 ) . The analytical expression of 𝛾 can be found by the general formula for finding the roots to quartic equations [ 37 ] or by numerical methods . This result simplifies if the right - hand side of Eq ( 7 ) equals to 0 , which is satisfied for two situations : ( i ) The monolayer has 𝑐 ’ = 2ℎ ( 𝑅 " − ℎ " ) ⁄ ; ( ii ) The vesicle is large . Then we have 𝛾 = 2𝑅ℎ 𝑅 " + ℎ " ( 8 ) Now , 𝛾 is only dependent on the vesicle size 𝑅 and the monolayer height ℎ . The larger value of ℎ gives larger value of 𝛾 . This means the thicker membrane will require larger portion of lipids to flip to release the membrane compression and stretching . The larger value of R gives smaller value of 𝛾 . This means the larger vesicle requires smaller portion of lipids to flip to release the membrane compression and stretching . For the flat membrane , R → + ∞ , the value of 𝛾 converges to 0 . Combining Eq ( 8 ) and Eq ( 4 ) , the difference between the two monolayers’ equilibrium areas is ∆𝐴 ’ = 𝐴 ’ , " − 𝐴 ’ , $ = 16𝜋𝑅 - ℎ ( 𝑅 " + ℎ " ) ⁄ . For the large radius 𝑅 ≫ ℎ , we have ∆𝐴 ’ = 16𝜋𝑅ℎ , which is the same as the prediction of ADE model [ 24 ] . In this limit ∆𝐴 ’ does not in fact converge to 0 as the vesicle radius R increases , but ∆𝐴 ’ 𝐴 ’ ⁄ does converge to 0 as R increases . According to the definition of membrane tension 𝜆 = 𝜇 ) ( 𝐴 − 𝐴 ’ ) 𝐴 ’ ⁄ [ 38 ] , we can calculate the membrane tension of each monolayer : 10 𝜆 $ = 𝜆 " = 𝜇 ) ℎ " 𝑅 " ( 9 ) From this expression , the inner and outer monolayer have the same positive tension , which means they are equally stretched after the lipid flip . For the more general situation , we need to solve Eq ( 7 ) numerically for 𝛾 , which results in distinct expressions for monolayer equilibrium area ( Eq . 4 ) . Generally , the two monolayers do not have equivalent tension . 2 . 2 Cylindrical membrane For a cylindrical membrane with the length L , the radius R is defined by the radius of the mid - surface whose area is 𝐴 * = 2𝜋𝑅𝐿 . The area of the inner monolayer is 𝐴 $ = 2𝜋 ( 𝑅 − ℎ ) 𝐿 and the area of the outer monolayer is 𝐴 " = 2𝜋 ( 𝑅 + ℎ ) 𝐿 . The mean curvature of the inner monolayer is 𝑐 $ = 1 / 2 ( 𝑅 − ℎ ) and of the outer monolayer is 𝑐 " = 1 / 2 ( 𝑅 + ℎ ) . For the cylinder , Eq . 6 then produces the expression for 𝛾 : ( 𝑅 − ℎ ) " 𝑅 " ( 1 − 𝛾 ) " − ( 𝑅 + ℎ ) " 𝑅 " ( 1 + 𝛾 ) " = 𝜅 𝜇 ) AB 1 𝑅 − ℎ − 𝑐 ’ C " − B 1 𝑅 + ℎ + 𝑐 ’ C " D ( 10 ) Eq ( 10 ) shows that 𝛾 is not dependent on the cylinder length L , but on the cylinder radius 𝑅 , the membrane height ℎ , lipid spontaneous curvature 𝑐 ’ , bending modulus 𝜅 and area elasticity modulus 𝜇 ) . By numerically solving Eq ( 10 ) , we can get the value of 𝛾 for the cylindrical membrane . If the right - hand side of Eq ( 10 ) equals to 0 , which may come from two situations : ( i ) The monolayer has 𝑐 ’ = ℎ ( 𝑅 " − ℎ " ) ⁄ ; ( ii ) The cylinder diameter is large . Then we have 𝛾 = ℎ 𝑅 ( 11 ) Now , 𝛾 is only dependent on the cylinder radius 𝑅 and the monolayer height ℎ . Similar to the spherical membrane , the value of 𝛾 decreases as the membrane height decreases or as the membrane radius increases , which means the thinner membrane or large membrane radius requires smaller portion of inner - layer lipids to flip to release the membrane compression and stretching . For the flat membrane R → + ∞ , the value of 𝛾 also converges to 0 . 2 . 3 Planar membrane For a flat membrane under no external forces , the two monolayers have the same area as the mid - surface 𝐴 $ = 𝐴 " = 𝐴 * . Therefore no driving force exists to re - equilibrate any membrane area , giving 𝛾 = 0 , 𝐴 ’ , $ = 𝐴 $ and 𝐴 ’ , " = 𝐴 " . 11 3 . Background on membrane energy for a continuum model with lipid tilt Here , we reproduce the key principles and assumptions defining the energy that couples two leaflets via lipid tilt and curvature , as they are necessary for our subsequent derivation . A detailed description of the tilt - curvature model and relevant mathematic proofs can be found in refs [ 30 - 32 ] . Each monolayer of the membrane can be regarded as a solid material , whose free energy per unit volume ( 𝐸M ) is [ 29 ] 𝐸M = 𝜎 ! . 𝑢 ! . + 1 2 𝜆 ! . / 0 𝑢 ! . 𝑢 / 0 , ( 12 ) where 𝜎 ! . is the stress tensor , 𝜆 ! . / 0 is the elastic modulus tensor , and 𝑢 ! . is the strain tensor , and a summation is performed for repeated indices . For small deformations , the strain tensor is defined by 𝑢 ! . = $ " B 12 ! 13 " + 12 " 13 ! C , where 𝑢 ! is the displacement , and 𝜉 ! represents the coordinate x , y , and z . After deformation , the element length dx , dy , dz along the three principal axes become 𝑑𝑥 4 = ( 1 + 𝑢 55 ) 𝑑𝑥 , 𝑑𝑦 4 = 01 + 𝑢 66 2𝑑𝑦 , 𝑑𝑧 4 = ( 1 + 𝑢 77 ) 𝑑𝑧 . Considering the membrane rotational symmetry and fluidity , Eq ( 12 ) becomes [ 30 ] 𝐸M = 𝜎 $ 0𝑢 55 + 𝑢 66 2 + 𝜎 77 𝑢 77 + 1 2 𝜆 $ 0𝑢 55 + 𝑢 66 2 " + 1 2 𝜆 " 𝑢 77 " + 𝜆 - 𝑢 77 0𝑢 55 + 𝑢 66 2 + 4𝜆 , 0𝑢 57 " + 𝑢 67 " 2 ( 13 ) With the definition of the relative expansion of the local area as 𝜀 = ( 𝑑𝑥 4 𝑑𝑦 4 − 𝑑𝑥𝑑𝑦 ) 𝑑𝑥𝑑𝑦⁄ , and the relative elongation of the local height as 𝜌 = ( 𝑑𝑧 4 − 𝑑𝑧 ) 𝑑𝑧⁄ , then we have [ 30 ] 𝑢 55 + 𝑢 66 = 𝜀 , ( 14 ) 𝑢 77 = 𝜌 . ( 15 ) The last term of Eq ( 13 ) reflects the lipid tilt : 4 0𝑢 57 " + 𝑢 67 " 2 = 𝑇 " [ 30 ] , where the absolute value of the lipid tilt equals to the tangent of the angle between the lipid orientation and the membrane normal , 𝑇 = tan 𝜃 , see Fig 2A . In the pure tilt situation , where lipids are inclined as straight lines and their head - to - tail lengths are stretched , both the membrane area and height are unchanged [ 30 ] , as shown in Fig 2A . The pure tilt model suggests that the lipid tilt is a physical term that is decoupled from the membrane area elasticity , and thus both contribute to the total membrane energy . 12 4 . Transforming the lipid tilt energy of the Helfrich Hamiltonian to a height deformation energy Here , with the helix insertion on one monolayer , lipids must be inclined nonlinearly to wrap around the helix . We consider the situation where both the membrane area and the lipid head - to - tail length are unchanged on this monolayer , consequently the monolayer height must be decreased because of the inclination . Deformations of tilt and area are assumed to be small , and thus the lipid tilt can be related to the relative height change , 𝑇 " = ( 𝑑𝑧 𝑑𝑧 4 ⁄ ) " − 1 = $ ( $ + 9 ) # − 1 . If we Taylor expand and keep terms to order 𝜌 " ( which will be accurate in a limit of small relative deformations 𝜌 ≪ 1 ) , then 𝑇 " ≈ 3𝜌 " − 2𝜌 and we have 4 0𝑢 57 " + 𝑢 67 " 2 ≈ 3𝜌 " − 2𝜌 ( 16 ) With Eqs ( 14 ) - ( 16 ) , we can rewrite Eq ( 13 ) as 𝐸M = 𝜎 $ 𝜀 + $ " 𝜆 $ 𝜀 " + 𝜆 - 𝜌𝜀 + ( 𝜎 77 − 2𝜆 , ) 𝜌 + ^ 3𝜆 , + $ " 𝜆 " _ 𝜌 " ( 17 ) Asserting the membrane is locally incompressible implies ( 1 + 𝜀 ) ( 1 + 𝜌 ) = 1 . Again To second order : 𝜌 ≈ −𝜀 + 𝜀 " ( 18 ) From previous work , the relative area expansion is related to the membrane curvature [ 30 , 31 ] , 𝜀 = 𝑧𝐻 − 1 2 𝑧 " 𝐻 " + 𝑧 " 𝐻 ; ( 19 ) where H and H G are the effective total and Gaussian curvature , respectively . When measured at the neutral surface , curvature and area deformations are decoupled energetically . Substituting Eq ( 19 ) and ( 18 ) into Eq ( 17 ) and explicitly keeping terms to second order in z , and 𝜌 ( consistent with an elastic model [ 30 ] ) , we have 𝐸M = 𝜎 ’ 𝑧𝐻 + 1 2 ( 𝜆 < − 𝜎 ’ ) 𝑧 " 𝐻 " + 𝜎 ’ 𝑧 " 𝐻 ; + 1 2 ( 6𝜆 , + 𝜆 " ) 𝜌 " ( 20 ) and 𝜎 ’ = 𝜎 $ − 𝜎 77 + 2𝜆 , ( 21a ) 𝜆 < = 2 ( 2𝜆 $ − 2𝜆 - + 𝜎 77 − 2𝜆 , ) ( 21b ) Taking the z - integral of Eq 20 , we recover the monolayer energy per unit surface area ( 𝐸b ) , , 13 𝐸b = 1 2 𝜅 ( 𝐻 − 𝐻 ’ ) " + 1 2 𝜅𝐻 ’ " + 𝜅 ; 𝐻 ; + 1 2 . ( 6𝜆 , + 𝜆 " ) 𝜌 " 𝑑𝑧 ( 22 ) where 𝜅 = . ( 𝜆 < − 𝜎 ’ ) 𝑧 " 𝑑𝑧 , ( 23a ) 𝐻 ’ = − 1 𝜅 . 𝜎 ’ 𝑧 𝑑𝑧 , ( 23b ) 𝜅 ; = ∫ 𝜎 ’ 𝑧 " 𝑑𝑧 . ( 23c ) Eq ( 22 ) is similar to previous works [ 30 ] , except that the last term of Eq ( 22 ) arises from the monolayer height instead of the lipid tilt . Eq ( 22 ) shows we can express the monolayer height deformation as a term separated from the monolayer curvature . In the simple situation where the local monolayer height changes uniformly along z axis , then 𝜌 equals to the global height change 𝜌 = ( ℎ − ℎ ’ ) ℎ ’ ⁄ , where h is the monolayer height and ℎ ’ is the equilibrium value of the monolayer height without perturbation . Then the energy per area due to the monolayer height deformation is $ " 𝜅 % ^ % = % $ % $ _ " and the height modulus , 𝜅 % = ∫ ( 6𝜆 , + 𝜆 " ) 𝑑𝑧 , describes the monolayer elasticity along the direction perpendicular to the monolayer surface . The total energy of the monolayer height deformation is obtained by the integral along the whole surface , 𝐸 % = ∫ $ " 𝜅 % ^ % = % $ % $ _ " 𝑑𝐴 . ( 24 ) It is noted that the tilt modulus is 𝜅 > = ∫ 2𝜆 , 𝑑𝑧 [ 30 ] . Then , we have 𝜅 % = 3𝜅 > + 𝜆 " ℎ ’ . Given that 𝜆 " is the elastic modulus along z axis , which always has a positive value , we know the height modulus of the monolayer is larger than three times of the tilt modulus , 𝜅 % > 3𝜅 > . It is noteworthy that the above z - integral is performed on the neutral surface whose area is supposed to be fixed during the deformation , so the monolayer area elasticity is not included . We conclude that one can derive the monolayer height elasticity from the tilt model , and the height elasticity is decoupled from the monolayer curvature and area elasticity . It is also noted that the above derivation is performed for one membrane monolayer . For the bilayer membrane , we can calculate the height deformation energy for each monolayer and sum them up to obtain the whole height energy of the bilayer . 5 . Derivation of a modified membrane energy due to helix insertion 14 In the previous section , we discussed the determination of membrane bending energy , area elasticity energy , and height elasticity energy . When an α - helix inserts into the outer monolayer surface of the membrane , it introduces perturbations to the membrane structure and subsequently affects the membrane energy . To account for the influence of helix insertion , we modify the membrane energy at three key points . ( i ) The helix insertion reaches to the hydrophobic regions of the outer monolayer , so the neutral surface area of the outer monolayer needs to include the area occupied by the helix . In our model , the effective equilibrium area of the outer monolayer is denoted as 𝐴 ’ , " + 𝑎 , where a is the helix insertion area . For the N - terminal α - helix of ENTH protein , a is about 2 nm 2 with 1 nm in width and 2 nm in length . It is important to note that 𝐴 ’ , " remains unchanged since the helix insertion is not assumed to induce lipid flip - flop . ( ii ) When the helix inserts into the outer monolayer , it causes the adjacent lipids to deform and wrap around the helix . As a result , the membrane appears thinner at the insertion site ( as depicted in Fig 2B ) . Let ' s consider a helix with a radius of r inserted into a monolayer with the monolayer height of ℎ ’ . Here , we consider the situation where the helix is only shallowly inserted into the membrane , rather than immersed completely in the middle of the monolayer . We assume that the adjacent lipids tightly wrap around the helix to prevent exposure of lipid tails to the surrounding solution . The decrease in membrane height is denoted as ∆ℎ ’ , whose value is the one before the membrane relaxes after the helix insertion . For one helix with r = 0 . 5 nm and half immersed ( as shown in Fig 2B ) , we calculate ∆ℎ ’ to be approximately 0 . 29 nm , while for completely immersed , ∆ℎ ’ is around 0 . 57 nm . As we can see , as the helix insertion becomes deeper , the membrane height decreases at the insertion point until the helix is fully inserted . In our model , we designate a specific zone on the outer monolayer surface as the helix insertion zone , and the equilibrium height of the outer monolayer at that zone is set as ℎ ’ − ∆ℎ ’ . It is noteworthy that ∆ℎ ’ is the decrease of the monolayer equilibrium height , not the observed decrease of the monolayer height . ( iii ) The spontaneous curvature of the helix insertion , denoted as 𝑐 ’ , ! ? @ , differs from the spontaneous curvature of the lipid monolayer 𝑐 ’ . In our model , when calculating the bending energy of the outer monolayer , we utilize 𝑐 ’ , ! ? @ at the insertion zone , while at other zones we use 𝑐 ’ . Moreover , the helix insertion on the outer monolayer is assumed not to affect the spontaneous curvature of the inner monolayer . 15 Figure 2 .

The pure tilt is drawn , where lipids are inclined constantly and their head - to - tail lengths are stretched , in order to keep the monolayer area and height unchanged ( B ) Schematic to show the monolayer height decreases after the α - helix insertion . 6 . Relation of helix binding affinity and the membrane energy As our previous work , we hypothesize the dissociation constant of helix binding to the membrane is [ 7 ] , 𝐾 A = [ 1𝑀 ] ∙ 𝑒𝑥𝑝 ^ = B + C + DE / % F _ , ( 25 ) where [ 1M ] is the standard state concentration , − μ is the chemical potential due to electrostatic interactions between protein and lipids , ε is the cost of protein conformational change like the helix folding , and Δ E is the mechanical energy change of the membrane due to the helix insertion into the outer monolayer . As − μ and ε are supposed to be constant , the affinity of helix to the membrane is only dependent on the membrane energy change , 𝐾 A ∝ exp ( Δ𝐸 𝑘 G 𝑇 ⁄ ) , and thus , a smaller value of Δ E represents a higher affinity of helix to the membrane . Our experiments can observe wide - type ENTH proteins recruited to small unilamellar vesicles ( SUVs ) of different radii . By recording the protein density on the vesicle ρ EL , and the PIP2 density ρ L and the solution concentration of the protein ρ E , we can calculate the dissociation constant of ENTH for different vesicles , 𝐾 A = 𝜌 E < ( 𝜌 E 𝜌 < ) ⁄ , as shown in Fig SX . Then substituting the value K D to Eq ( 22 ) , we get the membrane energy change due to per helix insertion , Δ E , and we further calculate ! ΔΔ E = Δ E − Δ E ref , where Δ E ref is chosen as the membrane energy change of the smallest vesicle ( radius about 10 nm ) in our experiment . The relation of ΔΔ E and the vesicle radius R is similar to the one of K D and R , Fig 9A and B . It shows ΔΔ E increases monotonically with the vesicle radius R . Methods 16 Ⅰ . Continuum membrane model 1 . Finite element method In this work , we use three layers of triangular mesh to represent the bilayer membrane , with the top and bottom layers of the mesh mimicking the neutral surface of each monolayer and the middle layer of the mesh mimicking the mid - surface of the bilayer membrane . The neutral surface is an intra - monolayer plane on which the deformations of monolayer bending and area elasticity are energetically decoupled [ 35 ] . Approximately , the neutral surface is located at the interface dividing the lipid polar heads and the hydrocarbon tails . The zone between the mesh layers represents the lipid hydrocarbon tails . Therefore , the bilayer height here refers to the hydrocarbon height of the bilayer membrane [ 39 ] . To build the three layers of triangular mesh , we first build the one as the outer monolayer mesh , and then move each vertex by ℎ ’ , the monolayer height value , to get the mid - surface mesh , and move each vertex by 2ℎ ’ to get the inner monolayer mesh . The movement direction depends on the geometry of the membrane . For example , for the spherical membrane , the movement is towards the center of the sphere . We call these three mesh - layers as triplets , because they have the same number of vertices and triangle elements , and the vertex indexes have the one - to - one correspondence between the three mesh - layers , so as the indexes of triangle elements . We calculate the area and curvature formed on each triangle on the top and bottom mesh - layers . We also calculate the distance between two elements on top and middle mesh - layer respectively with the same element index and project it to the normal of the outer element , then we get the local height of the outer monolayer . Likewise , we can calculate the local height of the inner monolayer . To simulate that one helix insertion is bound on the outer monolayer surface , we select several adjacent triangles on the outer mesh to represent the location of the insertion , and the area sum of these selected triangles is the insertion size a . The spontaneous curvature of the selected triangles is set as 𝑐 ’ , ! ? @ , the spontaneous curvature of the helix insertion which is different from lipid monolayer spontaneous curvature 𝑐 ’ . The monolayer height has an equilibrium value ℎ ’ , except the selected triangles that is set as ℎ ’ − ∆ℎ ’ . The equilibrium area of outer monolayer is set as 𝐴 ’ , " + 𝑎 , and the equilibrium area of inner monolayer is set as 𝐴 ’ , $ . The total energy of the membrane is calculated by the Eq ( 1 ) combined with its terms Eq ( 2 ) , Eq ( 3 ) and Eq ( 24 ) . It is noteworthy that in Eq ( 2 ) the curvature energy is defined by the integration on the equilibrium area of each monolayer [ 23 ] . Generally , the curvature energy is calculated on 17 the actual surface . In the finite - element analysis , the curvature energy for each monolayer is defined as [ 7 , 18 ] , 𝐸 = ∫ $ " 𝜅 [ 2𝐻 ( 𝒔 ) − 𝑐 ’ ( 𝒔 ) ] " √𝑎𝑑𝑠 $ 𝑑𝑠 " , ( 25 ) where { 𝑠 $ , 𝑠 " } is the curvilinear coordinates on the curved surface , and 𝒔 = 𝒔 ( 𝑠 $ , 𝑠 " ) represents each point on the surface in three - dimensional space . The force on each vertex is calculated by means of the finite element analysis , see Supporting Information . We perform computational simulations to minimize the energy of the membrane and get the structure and energy of the bilayer membrane at the equilibrium state . For all parameters and their values , please see Table 1 . The parameter value of DOPC membrane will be chosen as the default in our simulation unless extra notice is given . Table 1 . Parameters of the continuum membrane model and values for 4 types of lipid membranes . Note : * The height modulus is approximated by 𝜅 ! = 𝜅 " + 2𝜇 # which satisfies our theory prediction 𝜅 ! > 3𝜅 " . MD The equilibrium height decrease ∆ℎ $ is validated by our molecular dynamic simulations . 2 . Locally finer mesh around the insertion The helix insertion on the membrane will generate the membrane deformation locally distributed around the insertion . To describe the local deformation more precisely in the finite element method , we should use finer mesh . However , to make the mesh finer everywhere will make the simulation expensive . Instead , we choose to build the finer mesh only around the insertion zone locally , while zones further from the insertion keeps non - finer , FigS1 A and B . This locally finer mesh includes regular patches and three types of irregular patches . The regular patch is the triangle who has 12 one - ring vertices , or all its three vertices have the valence of 6 , while the irregular patch is the one whose one - ring vertices are not 12 , or at least one of its vertices doesn’t have the valence of 6 , see the supporting Table S1 . For the irregular patch , subdivision will be conducted to make it into 4 Parameter Symbol ( unit ) DOPC DLPC POPC DPPC Bilayer hydrocarbon height 2ℎ $ ( nm ) 2 . 71 [ 39 ] 2 . 09 [ 40 ] 2 . 75 [ 41 ] 2 . 85 [ 39 ] Monolayer spontaneous curvature 𝑐 $ ( nm - 1 ) −0 . 04 [ 42 ] + 0 . 11 [ 42 ] + 0 . 01 [ 42 ] + 0 . 05 [ 42 ] Bilayer bending modulus 2𝜅 ( k B T ) 19 . 4 [ 21 ] 20 . 4 [ 21 ] 25 . 7 [ 21 ] 27 . 5 [ 21 ] Tilt modulus 𝜅 " ( pN / nm ) 89 [ 21 ] 55 [ 21 ] 73 [ 21 ] 43 [ 21 ] Bilayer area modulus 2𝜇 # ( pN / nm ) 265 [ 43 ] 234 [ 44 ] 255 [ 44 ] 231 [ 44 ] Monolayer height modulus 𝜅 !

The area of the finer mesh is not a key parameter to influence the energy calculation as long as the area covers the local perturbation of the membrane induced by the helix , FigS1 C . Our results show the perturbation of the membrane generated by one helix always spreads within a limited area , smaller than 2 nm in radius , which will be shown later in the Results section . Therefore , by default , the local area of the finer mesh is set with the radius 5 nm . We notice that the membrane energy decreases as the mesh becomes finer around the insertion , FigS1 D . Though making the mesh infinitely finer around the insertion improves the mathematical precision of the calculation , yet we think the physical meaning is weakened . The lipid on membrane has an area about 0 . 5 nm 2 in average , which suggests the length of 0 . 7 nm for the triangle edge on the mesh . The finer mesh with the triangle edge far smaller than 0 . 7 nm should not represent the physical properties of the membrane . Therefore , we set the smallest triangle edge as 0 . 5 nm when we build the locally finer mesh . 3 . Boundary conditions Our continuum membrane model can simulate different membranes of variable shapes , such as vesicle , tubule and flat membranes . The vesicle membrane has an enclosed structure that doesn’t have a boundary . However , the tubule and flat membranes have edges that need boundary conditions to constraint the movement . We have three types of boundary conditions : free , fixed and periodic boundaries , which have been successfully developed and employed in our previous one - layered continuum membrane model [ 7 ] . For the free boundary , positions of vertices at the edge are dependent on its neighbor vertices’ positions regardless of the nodal forces on the edge vertices , FigS 2A . For the fixed boundary , the edge vertices are fixed and can’t move during the simulation , FigS 2B . For the periodic boundary , we create three layers of temporary vertices outside the edge of the mesh , called ghost vertices , to help calculate the position updates of the edge vertices . The locations of ghost vertices are determined by translation of the mesh vertices at the opposite edge , FigS 2C . We perform the boundary condition on each of the two monolayers separately , but we don’t allow the two monolayers have different types of boundary conditions . In this paper , the periodic boundary is the default for flat or tubular membranes , unless the extra 19 notice is given .

Protein Purification and Labeling ENTH was purified and labeled as previously described [ 1 ] . Briefly , ENTH was expressed as a fusion protein containing N - terminal glutathione - S - transferase ( GST ) in E coli BL21 . These cells were lysed and centrifuged , and the protein was purified from the supernatant with affinity columns in a three - step process . First , the supernatant was incubated with glutathione agarose beads , and excess cell material was washed from the bound proteins . Thrombin was used to cleave the proteins from the beads , and excess thrombin was removed with p - aminobenzamidine - agarose . The purity of the protein was verified using SDS - PAGE and UV - Vis spectroscopy . The product 20 was then concentrated and stored at - 80C after snap freezing in liquid nitrogen . The purified protein was labeled with ATTO488 NHS - ester that was pre - dissolved in DMSO . The total DMSO in the protein / dye mixture was kept to less than 1 . 5 % by volume . The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes at a 2x stoichiometric excess of ATTO488 NHS - ester . Excess dye and DMSO were removed by running the reaction solution through a 7k Zeba Spin column . 3 .

This lipid suspension was cycled three times through a freeze / thaw cycle ( 2 minutes to freeze in liquid nitrogen , and 2 minutes to thaw in a 60 o C water bath ) . It was followed by extrusion through a 50nm and 200nm polycarbonate filter with average diameters of 79 nm and 127 nm , respectively , determined by dynamic light scattering .

Proteins and vesicles were visualized on a laser scanning confocal microscope ( Leica Stellaris 5 ) using 488 and 561 nm lasers for excitation for the proteins and lipids , respectively . 21 Results Ⅰ . Membrane deformations induced by the helix insertion in the continuum model with comparison to MD simulations 1 . Membrane thins around the helix insertion The helix insertion can induce local membrane deformations . By simulating the helix insertion on the top monolayer of the flat membrane , our continuum membrane model shows the top monolayer thins around the insertion zone , Fig 3A and B . The height deformation of the top monolayer has a radial distribution around the insertion , Fig 3A , showing a monotonical decrease of the height when closer to the helix insertion , Fig 3B . Because the two monolayers closely contact , the mechanical deformation on the top monolayer can affect the bottom monolayer , which results in the perturbation of the bottom monolayer height . Like the top monolayer , the height deformation of the bottom monolayer also has a radial distribution . However , unlike the top monolayer , the bottom monolayer doesn’t show a monotonical decrease of its height . It also shows that the height deformation of the two monolayers will be more parent if the value of ∆ℎ ’ is larger , Fig 3B . According to our model , the larger ∆ℎ ’ corresponds to the deeper insertion of the helix into the monolayer . Therefore , Fig 3B means the deeper insertion of the helix can induce larger perturbation of the two monolayers . Our simulations also show that the height perturbation because of the helix insertion is always limited in a small area with the perturbation decaying drastically where it is about 2 . 5 nm farther from the insertion , as shown in Fig 3B . 2 . Deformed membrane shape is dependent on insertion depth and membrane height . The helix insertion also perturbs the membrane shape . The helix spontaneous curvature , 𝑐 ’ , ! ? @ > 0 nm - 1 , tends to make the top monolayer bulge up around the insertion . However , the inclines of lipids adjacent to the insertion tend to make the top monolayer dent down around the helix . These two factors work together to determine the equilibrium shape of the membrane . In our simulations here , we fix the value of the helix spontaneous curvature , 𝑐 ’ , ! ? @ = 0 . 3 nm - 1 as suggested by our previous study [ 7 ] , and investigate how the helix insertion affects the membrane shape . The incline of lipids around the insertion is dependent on the insertion depth , which is characterized by ∆ℎ ’ . Our continuum membrane model shows that the small ∆ℎ ’ gives the small bulge on the membrane up - surface , but the large ∆ℎ ’ gives the dent on the membrane up - surface , Fig 3C . This means , for 22 the shallow insertion , the helix spontaneous curvature will slightly dominate the membrane up - surface shape to make a small bulge , but for the deep insertion , the large incline of the lipids will dominate the membrane up - surface shape to make a dent . The middle - surface and down - surface of the membrane are also perturbed because of the helix insertion on the top monolayer , Fig 3C . The down - surface is always arched up towards the top of the membrane , with the arch being larger if the insertion is deeper . The middle - surface of the membrane is also arched up in our simulations , though its shape is not smooth as the down - surface . Besides the insertion depth , our results show the height of the membrane can regulate the membrane shape too . With the fixed insertion depth , ∆ℎ ’ = 0 . 3 nm , the up - surface of the membrane becomes more bulged if the membrane is thicker , meanwhile the down - surface is less arched and the middle - surface is still unsmoothly arched , Fig 3D . To comprehensively consider the membrane properties , we perform simulations with helix insertion on DLPC membrane . Compared to DOPC membrane , the DLPC membrane shows a more dented up - surface , more perturbed middle - surface and slightly more arched down - surface , Fig 3E . These results mean the deformed membrane shape induced by the helix insertion is dependent on properties of both the helix insertion and membrane . 3 . Optimized parameters with comparison to MD simulations . Our results above show the helix spontaneous curvature 𝑐 ’ , ! ? @ , value of ∆ℎ ’ and membrane height 2ℎ ’ together determine the membrane deformation after the helix inserted to one monolayer . The membrane height can be directly found from the previous experimental works , and the helix spontaneous curvature has supported values , as shown in Table 1 . However , the value of ∆ℎ ’ has not been determined . To determine the optimal value of ∆ℎ ’ , we compare the simulation results of our model with molecular dynamic simulations . MD simulation with the ENTH helix shows that the membrane thins around the insertion , with the up - surface dented down and middle - and down - surface arched up slightly , which is consistent with results of our continuum membrane model . The decrease of the membrane height in MD simulations is observed about 0 . 75 Å for DOPC membrane . To best fit the MD results , we find ∆ℎ ’ ≈ 0 . 30 nm for the helix insertion on DOPC or DLPC membranes , as shown in Fig 3C and E , respectively . According to our analysis above , ∆ℎ ’ ≈ 0 . 30 nm corresponds to the situation where the helix is half immersed to the membrane , Fig 2B . 23 Figure 3 . Membrane is deformed because of the helix insertion . ( A ) The height deformation of the DOPC membrane has a radial distribution around the helix insertion . ( B ) The height deformation of the DOPC membrane decays as the distance from the insertion is longer , dependent on ∆ℎ & .

( D ) The DOPC membrane is perturbed on its shape because of the helix insertion with ∆ℎ & = 0 . 3 nm , regulated by the membrane height 2ℎ & . ( E ) The DLPC membrane is perturbed on its shape because of the helix insertion , dependent on ∆ℎ & . MD simulations captured the lipid trace around the ENTH α - helix with the membrane lipid DOPC and DLPC respectively . The sn - 1 chain is shown in blue . The sn - 2 chain is shown in green . The extend 24 headgroup region is red . The CHARMM C24 atom ( the approximate neutral surface ) is shown in purple . The height of the C24 atom is shown as the black dots . Since the bottom layer of the membrane keeps almost flat in our MD simulations , the height of the C24 atom should satisfy the same curve as the membrane height . We translationally move the black dots up or down to make their right - side overlap with the height of the continuum membrane model . Ⅱ . Material properties of the membrane and the helix impact curvature sensing 1 . Two - leaflet model captures curvature sensing To see the curvature sensing of the helix insertion , we ran simulations with one a - helix bound on vesicles of different radii . Our simulations show that the membrane energy change Δ E due to one helix insertion increases monotonously as the vesicle becomes larger , Fig 4A , which means the helix has higher affinity to the small vesicle than to the large vesicle . By analyzing the three components of the energy , i . e . the curvature energy , the area elasticity energy , and the height elasticity energy , we found they all increase as the vesicle is larger , which suggests all these three types of energy contribute positively to the curvature sensing phenomenon . We also draw ΔΔ E vs vesicle radius R , Fig 4B , where ΔΔ E = Δ E −Δ E ( R = 15nm ) represents the difference of the membrane energy change relative to the one of the smallest vesicle R = 15 nm . It can be seen from Fig 4B that the curvature energy and area elasticity energy increase faster than the height elasticity energy when the vesicle become larger , which suggests that the curvature sensing of a - helix insertion is mainly dependent on the membrane bending and the area change . Figure 4 . Curvature sensing of one α - helix . ( A ) Membrane energy change because of one α - helix insertion vs vesicle radius . ( B ) Replot of ( A ) with ΔΔ E = Δ E −Δ E ( R = 15nm ) . Simulations were performed with DOPC membrane parameters with the bilayer hydrophobic height as 4 . 0 nm , and the helix insertion has the area of 2 nm 2 and spontaneous curvature of 0 . 3 nm - 1 . 25 2 . Thicker membrane enhances membrane binding and curvature sensing . To investigate the effect of the membrane height on the helix insertion on the membrane , we ran simulations of vesicles with the same radius but variable height . Our results show that by increasing the membrane height , Δ E becomes smaller , Fig 5A , which means the helix insertion has a higher affinity to the thicker membrane . By the comparison of the three energy components , we can tell that the height sensing is dominated by the height elasticity energy , slightly attributed to the curvature energy , and not dependent on the area elasticity energy . Our results also show the height sensing phenomenon can happen on vesicles of any radius , Fig 5B . It is noted that the curvature sensing is robustly captured no matter how thick the membrane is , Fig 5C . By drawing ΔΔ E vs vesicle radius R , Fig 5D , where ΔΔ E = Δ E −Δ E ( R = 15nm ) as in Fig 4B , we can clearly see that the curvature sensing of the helix insertion is more obvious on the membrane with the larger height . Figure 5 . Membrane height affects curvature sensing . ( A ) Membrane energy change Δ E because of one α - helix insertion vs membrane height 2 h 0 . Simulations were performed with vesicle radius R = 90 nm . ( B ) Relation of Δ E and 2 h 0 on vesicles of different radii . ( C ) Relation of Δ E and vesicle radius with different height 2 h 0 . ( D ) Replot ( C ) with 26 ΔΔ E = Δ E −Δ E ( R = 15nm ) . Simulations were performed with DOPC membrane parameters , and the helix insertion has the area of 2 nm 2 and spontaneous curvature of 0 . 3 nm - 1 . 3 . Larger deformation of local lipids strengthens the binding affinity and curvature sensing . The change of the membrane height Δ h 0 at the insertion results from the lipid deformation adjacent to the a - helix . The more significant deformation of lipids gives a more considerable decrease in membrane height . Our simulations show Δ h 0 can influence the a - helix affinity to the membrane and its curvature sensing ability . Our results show a larger value of Δ h 0 makes Δ E become larger , Fig 6A . It means the a - helix will have a lower affinity to bind to the membrane if its insertion makes the lipids more deformed because it will cost more energy . Meanwhile , the curvature sensing ability of the a - helix will become stronger if its insertion makes the lipids more deformed , Fig 6B . Previous works have proposed that the a - helix has different insertion depth on the membrane [ 45 ] . Since the insertion depth can affect the value of Δ h 0 , we suppose ENTH proteins may regulate their affinity and curvature sensing by changing their insertion depth . 27 Figure 6 . Lipid deformation affects curvature sensing . ( A ) Membrane energy change Δ E because of one α - helix insertion depends on the equilibrium value of the height decrease at the insertion Δ h 0 . Simulations were performed with vesicle radius R = 60 nm . ( B ) Relation of ΔΔ E and vesicle R is regulated by Δ h 0 . Here , ΔΔ E = Δ E − Δ E ( R = 15nm ) . 4 . The lipid spontaneous curvature modulates curvature sensing . We ran simulations of the a - helix insertion on membranes with different lipid compositions by changing the spontaneous curvature of the two monolayers . Different lipids have different spontaneous curvatures 𝑐 ’ , for example , DOPC has a negative spontaneous curvature of −0 . 04 nm - 1 , and DLPC has a positive spontaneous curvature of + 0 . 11 nm - 1 , see the Table 1 . Our simulations show that by increasing the lipid spontaneous curvature from −0 . 25 nm - 1 to −0 . 06 nm - 1 , the membrane energy change Δ E is increased , Fig 7A . These results suggest the a - helix insertion has a higher affinity to the membrane that has lipids with more negative spontaneous curvature . With the calculated Δ E , we can calculate the relative binding equilibrium constant 𝐾 HI 𝐾 HI’ ⁄ = exp [ − ( Δ𝐸 − ∆𝐸 ’ ) 𝑘 G 𝑇 ⁄ ] , where ∆𝐸 ’ is the membrane energy change because of one helix insertion on the reference vesicle with the spontaneous curvature 𝑐 ’ = −0 . 06 nm - 1 , and 𝐾 HI’ is the corresponding equilibrium constant for the helix insertion binding on this reference vesicle . Our results show 𝐾 HI 𝐾 HI’ ⁄ increases as the lipid spontaneous curvature becomes more negative , and the tendency agrees well with the previous experimental data . With these results , we suppose that ENTH a - helix should have different binding affinities to different membranes , and the curvature sensing phenomenon would also be changed synchronously . Figure 7 . Helix insertion senses the lipid spontaneous curvature c 0 . ( A ) Membrane energy change Δ E because of one α - helix insertion depends on the lipid spontaneous curvature c 0 . ( B ) The calculated relation of 𝐾 ’ ( 𝐾 ’ ( & ⁄ with c 0 . Here , Simulations were performed with vesicle radius R = 28 nm , and the helix insertion size is 4 nm 2 ( 4 nm in length and 1 nm in width ) , consistent with previous setup . 28 5 . ENTH helix does not sense membrane asymmetry . Plasma membrane is famous for the asymmetry between its two monolayers , which is maintained to play significant biological roles . We wonder whether the membrane asymmetry can affect ENTH helix insertion on the membrane . We performed simulations with one helix insertion on the outer monolayer of the vesicle with the radius 60 nm , and changed the spontaneous curvature of the inner monolayer 𝑐 ’ to simulate the two monolayers are composed of different lipid compositions . Our simulations show the membrane energy change due to the helix insertion only slightly varies with the inner monolayer 𝑐 ’ , Fig 8A . Although the curvature energy and area energy is more influenced by the inner 𝑐 ’ than the height energy , yet the total energy is only slightly fluctuated with inner 𝑐 ’ . We further ran more simulations with different insertion depth or Δ h 0 . It shows the larger Δ h 0 doesn’t make it more drastic for the membrane energy change with the inner 𝑐 ’ , and the energy fluctuation is always within 0 . 5 k B T ( Fig 8B ) , which is smaller than the thermodynamics so that no experiments can observe . Therefore , we conclude that the ENTH helix insertion on one monolayer of the membrane doesn’t have a strong sense of the membrane asymmetry . Figure 8 . Helix insertion can’t sense the membrane asymmetry . ( A ) Relation between membrane energy change Δ E because of one helix insertion and the lipid spontaneous curvature c 0 of the inner monolayer . ( B ) Δ h 0 doesn’t regulate much on the relations of ( A ) . Here , ΔΔ E = Δ E − Δ E ( c 0 = 0 nm - 1 ) . The simulations were performed with vesicle radius R = 60 nm , and the helix insertion on the outer monolayer has the size 2 nm 2 ( 2 nm in length and 1 nm in width ) . The membrane parameters follow DOPC membrane . Ⅲ . Comparison of model predictions with in vitro experiments . 29 1 . Model captures the curvature sensing ability of helix insertion on different lipid compositions . To test our model predictions , we performed in vitro experiments measuring curvature sensing of the ENTH domain to vesicles of varying radii , as in previous work [ 46 ] , but here with variations to lipid composition . To eliminate changes to chemistry that could influence recruitment of ENTH to the membranes , we kept the PIP 2 concentration the same and compared DOPC , DLPC , POPC , and DPPC containing liposomes . Thus , the head group phosphatidyl choline remained unchanged but the tail groups varied . The expected moduli for these lipids are known and collected in Table 1 . Because the tail groups influence all moduli , it is not obvious how the preference of ENTH to highly curved membrane will vary . From experiments , we see that ENTH shows stronger curvature sensing , or a higher relative affinity for highly curved membranes , when they are composed of DOPC compared to DLPC . The change in binding energy between the largest and smallest vesicle for DOPC reaches 1 . 9 k B T , while for DLPC membrane it is closer to 1 . 5 k B T . POPC is quite similar to DOPC . We mimicked these same lipid compositions with our continuum double leaflet - model using parameters in Table 1 and the same vesicle radii as in the experiment . The simulations show excellent agreement to the experiment , predicting that curvature sensing is stronger for DOPC compared to DLPC , despite a nearly identical bending modulus for both lipids ( Fig 9 ) . A detailed analysis of our simulation data shows the curvature bending and area elasticity energies increase more drastically with vesicle radius when the ENTH helix inserts on DOPC , which is a thicker lipid with a higher tilt modulus . 30 Figure 9 . Comparison between in vitro experiment and computational results . ( A ) ENTH helix binding to membrane of DOPC lipid . ( B ) ENTH helix binding to membrane of DLPC lipid . ( C ) ENTH helix binding to membrane of POPC lipid . ( D ) ENTH helix binding to membrane of DPPC lipid . The parameters in the simulations are as in the Table 1 . Discussion Our results demonstrate how continuum membrane models that capture key mechanical properties of the membrane including bending modulus , tilt modulus , area compressibility , and bilayer height can accurately capture the structural and energetic changes to the bilayer upon amphipathic helix insertion . Hence , despite lacking molecular - level details on lipid packing and reorganization around the helix insertion , they can nonetheless faithfully capture the local perturbations to the double - leaflet bilayer driven by the helix - induced changes to area , spontaneous curvature , and membrane height . We carefully assessed how variations in material parameters of an explicit double - leaflet bilayer will change the curvature sensing by proteins inserted into the outer leaflet . We showed how the height of the bilayer , which varies as lipid tail group varies , will increase the curvature sensing by protein insertions , driving a stronger binding selectivity for more highly curved membranes . Symmetric leaflets with a negative spontaneous curvature also produce 31 stronger curvature sensing . In contrast , asymmetry between the leaflets has negligible impact on curvature sensing , indicating the phenomenon is primarily driven by the properties of the outer leaflet . More deeply inserted helices also drive stronger curvature sensing . Our model is capable of arbitrary topologies , with explicit implementations for membranes initialized as spheres , cylinders , and flat surfaces . It can be immediately applied to quantify membrane remodeling by additional mechanisms such as protein scaffolding , and is available open source . Our double - leaflet model improves upon the single - surface model of the bilayer by explicitly capturing bilayer height and asymmetries between leaflets that are widespread in biological membranes . One limitation of the model is that we excluded Gaussian curvature terms because we kept the topology of our membrane surfaces unchanged . However , some protein driven perturbations like transmembrane proteins and pore formation can affect topology so this term would need to be added . Another limitation of any continuum model is that it is difficult or impossible to account for inhomogenity in the lipid distributions across the surface , which could affect local mechanical properties . A partitioning of lipids by type could influence flip - flop across the membrane , for example . An interesting outcome of our model is that we can quantify the extent of membrane that is locally perturbed by the single helix insertion . Both our continuum membrane model and MD simulations show that the helix of ENTH protein only perturbs a small area on the membrane of no more than 1 . 5nm from the center of the helix . Given that the ENTH protein is ~ 4nm in length and ~ 1 . 2nm in width , the perturbation area of two ENTH helix insertions has minimal overlap even when they are adjacent . This indicates that two helices will be effectively independent of one another , each contributing the same energetic change when inserted to the membrane with negligible cooperativity . However , as the length of the helix increases , the perturbed area of the membrane extends out further , which could lead to coupling between adjacent helices . In previous work that studied infinitely long helix insertions on 3D flat membranes using classical elasticity theory , the helices did impact one another energetically [ 30 , 31 ] . We thus predict that the length of the helix has a further role for inducing cooperativity between multiple helix insertions on flat or curved membranes . Overall , this model provides an experimentally validated tool that will provide a powerful resource for characterizing how properties of biological membranes and the proteins that interact with them drive functional membrane remodeling . 32 References 1 .
