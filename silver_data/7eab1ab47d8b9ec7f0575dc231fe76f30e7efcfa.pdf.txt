Predominantly rural states have been disproportionately affected by the opioid overdose crisis while simul - taneously facing diminished access to drug treatment services . The purpose of this study is to explore barriers and facilitators to engagement in drug treatment among PWID residing in a rural county in West Virginia . Methods From June to July 2018 , in - depth interviews ( n = 21 ) that explored drug treatment experiences among PWID were conducted in Cabell County , West Virginia . Participants were recruited from locations frequented by PWID such as local service providers and public parks . An iterative , modified constant comparison approach was used to code and synthesize interview data . Results Participants reported experiencing a variety of barriers to engaging in drug treatment , including low thresh - olds for dismissal , a lack of comprehensive support services , financial barriers , and inadequate management of with - drawal symptoms . However , participants also described several facilitators of treatment engagement and sustained recovery . These included the use of medications for opioid use disorder and supportive health care workers / program staff . Conclusions Our findings suggest that a range of barriers exist that may limit the abilities of rural PWID to success - fully access and remain engaged in drug treatment in West Virginia . Improving the public health of rural PWID popula - tions will require expanding access to evidence - based drug treatment programs that are tailored to participants’ individual needs .

Harm Reduction Journal ( 2023 ) 20 : 69 Background Over the past two decades , the opioid crisis in the USA has worsened , creating a sustained need for increased access to low - threshold , evidence - based substance use treatment programs [ 1 , 2 ] . There are more than three million persons in the USA currently living with an opi - oid use disorder [ 3 ] . Yet according to the 2019 National Survey on Drug Use and Health ( NSDUH ) , only 10 . 3 % of all individuals ages 12 and above who had a substance use disorder received treatment in the previous year [ 4 , 5 ] . A major contributing factor to low drug treatment engage - ment is an overall lack of program access : a 2019 geospa - tial analysis found that over 32 % of all US counties had no opioid use disorder treatment programs [ 6 ] . Further , sig - nificant disparities in program availability exist by region , with counties in the southern and mid - central regions of the US having the lowest rates of program availability [ 7 ] . Within the USA , the Appalachian region has been dis - proportionately impacted by the opioid overdose crisis [ 8 ] . Spanning 13 US states , the area is characterized by high rates of nonmedical prescription drug and illicit opi - oid use and overdose morbidity and mortality [ 1 , 8 – 10 ] . A 2017 report from the Appalachian Regional Com - mission indicated that drug overdose deaths were 37 % greater in the Appalachian region than the rest of the US [ 10 , 11 ] . The state of West Virginia has been particularly hard hit , reporting the highest rates of drug overdose in the country for several years [ 12 ] . In 2019 , West Virginia had 52 . 8 overdoses per 100 , 000 inhabitants ( compared to the national rate of 21 . 6 / 100 , 000 ) [ 12 , 13 ] . An extensive body of the literature demonstrates that engagement in evidence - based drug treatment is associ - ated with positive outcomes among people who inject drugs ( PWID ) . Substance use disorder treatment is not standardized within the US : Programs vary substantially in their structure , length , and composition [ 14 ] . They can be short or long term , inpatient , outpatient , or fully residential , and individual or group - level . While many require private insurance or payment out of pocket , some public funding supports substance use disorder treat - ment , specifically through federal / state grants and reim - bursement from Medicaid , a publicly funded insurance program covering many low - income and vulnerable pop - ulations within the US [ 15 , 16 ] . Treatment programs fur - ther differ in their ideological underpinnings , with some advocating an abstinence - based approach and others offering medications for opioid use disorder ( MOUD ) . There is strong evidence supporting the effectiveness of MOUD [ 17 ] . Three MOUD formulations have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration : methadone , buprenorphine , and naltrexone . Methadone distribution is highly regulated and limited to specific , federally certified opioid treatment programs / clinics [ 18 ] . Patients are typically required to make daily in - person visits to these sites , where they are dosed under direct supervision by program staff . Buprenorphine is phy - sician - prescribed and also tightly regulated , though restrictions have been relaxed in recent years to reduce access barriers in response to the COVID - 19 pandemic . Buprenorphine can be offered within treatment pro - grams , hospitals , and primary care clinics , and prescrip - tions typically start at a seven - day duration , increasing to 30 - day doses for patients deemed clinically stable [ 19 ] . Prescribing restrictions on naltrexone are the least strin - gent , and this medication is often prescribed in a primary care setting . MOUD programs have been associated with a range of positive outcomes among PWID , including tempering the often - debilitating experience of opioid withdrawal [ 17 , 20 ] , reducing HIV and HCV infections and transmission risk behaviors , and decreasing injec - tion drug use , risky injection practices , and all - cause and overdose mortality [ 21 – 24 ] . Despite the benefits of MOUD , it is difficult to access among individuals with OUD : 60 % of residential treatment programs in the US do not offer MOUD , and very few ( 1 . 3 % ) offer a full range of available MOUD options ( e . g . , methadone , buprenor - phine , naltrexone ) [ 25 , 26 ] . Drug treatment programs that do offer MOUD are often unavailable in areas of need , including many rural communities [ 18 ] . In particular , a lack of MOUD access has been documented within the Appalachian region [ 27 – 29 ] . With a majority of Appalachia comprised of rural areas , access to both physical and mental healthcare services is limited compared to urban areas [ 8 , 30 , 31 ] . Further , residents face a shortage of adequately trained substance use treatment providers and a limited number of physicians with prescribing authority for MOUD [ 32 , 33 ] . While statistics related to drug treatment availability and utilization are informative , they do not speak to the lived experiences of those seeking substance use treat - ment , including PWID . First person accounts of chal - lenges and enabling factors may afford nuanced insights into how to best meet the needs of this population . The purpose of this research was to qualitatively explore the barriers and facilitators to drug treatment engagement among a rural population of PWID in West Virginia . Methods Study setting and data collection Data for this study were collected during June and July 2018 in Cabell County , West Virginia . Cabell County is a predominantly rural county that is characterized by high rates of overdose and has an estimated 2 . 4 % popu - lation prevalence of recent ( past six months ) injection drug use [ 34 – 36 ] . Participants were recruited from the Cabell - Huntington Harm Reduction Program ( operated Page 3 of 10 Winiker et al . Harm Reduction Journal ( 2023 ) 20 : 69 by the Cabell - Huntington Health Department ) , as well as nearby areas where PWID were known to congregate , such as parks and neighborhoods . To be eligible to par - ticipate , persons were required to be a resident of Cabell County , at least 18 years of age or older , and to have recently injected drugs ( past 30 days ) . Interviews were guided by a semi - structured interview guide developed by the research team . Interviews were conducted by study team members in a private area . To characterize our participants , we first asked that they report their age , gender , and race / ethnicity . We subse - quently asked participants a series of questions about their experiences with any form of drug treatment , including types , location , and overall thoughts and opin - ions about the process . Forms of drug treatment included but were not limited to : MOUD , in - patient programs , out - patient programs , and detoxification / abstinence only programs . Given the relative scarcity of drug treat - ment programs in the state of West Virginia , the research team sought to explore drug treatment programs broadly rather than investigate experiences with any one spe - cific type of program . Interviews lasted approximately 45 – 75 min and were audio recorded and transcribed ver - batim . Participants received $ 40 for their participation . To protect participants’ identities , all data were collected anonymously . This study was approved by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health Institutional Review Board . Data analysis We used an iterative , constant comparative approach for analyzing textual interview data [ 37 ] . The lead qualita - tive researcher developed an initial coding framework upon review of 10 transcripts . Three qualitative coders then reviewed the transcripts and revised the codebook in collaboration with the lead researcher . Once codebook development was finalized , the qualitative coders applied codes to a subset of selected transcripts . The transcripts were then reviewed to assess intercoder reliability ( ICR ) , a means of numerically assessing agreement between two or more coders on the application of codes within a qual - itative text [ 38 ] . After demonstrating satisfactory con - sistency ( k ≥ 0 . 70 ) [ 39 ] , qualitative coders independently coded all remaining transcripts through Atlas . ti qualita - tive software . Results Twenty - one individuals participated in the in - depth interviews in Cabell County . Among our sample , par - ticipants ranged in age from 25 to 62 years old ( mean : 37 ) . Most participants identified as male ( 67 % ) and non - Hispanic white ( 95 % ) . Eighty - six percent reported heroin as their drug of choice . All participants reported having previously engaged in at least one form of drug treat - ment , and most described having engaged in several drug treatment programs . For example , a 32 - year - old female participant stated , “I’ve been in and out of treatment , Methadone , Suboxone , Subutex , inpatient rehab , outpa - tient rehab , I’ve done it all . ” Similarly , a 42 - year - old male explained that he had attended numerous drug treatment programs : “I’ve been to five drug rehabs . ” Participants described several factors that served as barriers to their ability to remain engaged in drug treatment and abstain from drug use . In addition , MOUD and supportive healthcare providers facilitated successful recovery and treatment engagement . Barriers to sustained engagement in drug treatment and substance use cessation Limited access Participants described limited availability of and access to drug treatment programs as a primary barrier to engage - ment . When asked about his experience getting into treatment , one 48 - year - old male highlighted that entry to programs was difficult due to long program waitlists : “Very hard . It’s always hard… hard to find a place when you want . It’s always a waiting list , and it’s always long . ” Participants felt that access to drug treatment was dif - ficult due to a shortage of treatment facilities in the area , which led some individuals to seek care in programs out - side of West Virginia , including in Ohio , North Carolina , and Massachusetts . One female participant who accessed a local methadone program emphasized the importance of methadone availability for people who use opioids . However , she commented that the program was poorly run and the only one available in the area : The methadone clinic here in Huntington , metha - done is a great option especially for heroin addicts , but the way they run the place is terrible . I wish somebody would get in there and fix it , because it’s the only one we have around here , [ lists three town names ] . Other than that , it’s just the Suboxone doc - tors which are super hard to get into . The same participant went on to highlight barriers to Suboxone access due to transportation challenges , stat - ing , “Well if you don’t live on the bus line , you have to find a ride or walk , and I mean that’s the majority of the people , because there’s not Suboxone doctors on the bus line really . ” Low thresholds for dismissal Participants described experiencing low thresholds for dismissal from drug treatment programs , which some - times occurred for reasons beyond their personal con - trol . A 27 - year - old male participant who reported being Page 4 of 10 Winiker et al . Harm Reduction Journal ( 2023 ) 20 : 69 in a methadone program stated , “I got kicked out because I had got put in the hospital for five days . And the day after I got admitted to the hospital , I was supposed to have a drug test . I was observed . And when I missed it… because they had me in the hospital for five days , they discharged me . ” This participant further reported that he was told he would have to wait at least 30 days until he could try to be readmitted to the program , leaving him without access to drug treatment during this time . Another 25 - year - old female participant described being dismissed for multiple reasons over the course of her engagement in drug treatment : I got kicked out of [ drug treatment facility # 1 ] for acting on impulse and emotion , and then I went to [ drug treatment facility # 2 ] . The [ drug treatment facility # 2 ] didn’t feel it was a very good fit for me . Then I went back to [ drug treatment facility # 1 ] , and then got discharged for sneaking out at night… Many participants identified that their dismissal from residential drug treatment programs preceded their resumption of drug use . Among those who were in resi - dential programs , resumption of drug use frequently occurred during the immediate post - release period , oftentimes when they were confronted with marginal housing options . A 25 - year - old female participant , for example , described resuming drug use when she was forced to live in an abandoned property because she had nowhere else to stay after dismissal from a treatment program : “Don’t really know why I did it , but I was in a bando [ abandoned property ] after being discharged from [ drug treatment facility ] for sneaking out , and used…” . Lack of comprehensive support services Many participants reported that upon completion or dismissal from drug treatment programs , they faced a shortage of follow - up and support services . This made sustained cessation of drug use difficult , as partici - pants felt they did not have access to the necessary tools required to maintain sobriety . A 42 - year - old female par - ticipant explained that despite expressing a strong desire to remain in drug treatment , she was discharged because staff felt she had acquired the tools needed to maintain substance use cessation . This left her without continued support to remain engaged in her recovery . They said they’ve seen that I had all the tools I needed . I just needed to apply them . And there’s other people that need it [ drug treatment ] more than me . So they wouldn’t let me go to phase two . They said there’s other people who needed it more than me . Another participant , a 40 - year - old female , described that a lack of access to jobs and housing upon completion of detox made maintaining her sobriety challenging . But that’s the biggest problem . There’s so many that I know would go get help if they had—if there was a job available for them when they got out of a 30 - day detox or a 90 - day or whatever . Even if it was just a part - time three days a week cleaning the city , going around and cleaning the trash up or anything . If there was a little job for them , even minimum wage three days a week , it gives them dignity . It gives them something to look forward to . And an apartment or even just a house that they didn’t have to worry about having to pay the bills right off . That’s the biggest thing . That’s the number one thing out here that’s holding so many people back . Financial barriers Several participants reported that while they may desire to engage in longer term treatment , they were unable to do so because of financial barriers . In particular , the longer - term recovery programs many participants sought often required a weekly payment that was unaffordable . A 40 - year - old female participant , for example , explained : The biggest issue out there and this has been me liv - ing on the street for a year , plus being sober for six years , the biggest problem we’re having out there is so many of them want recovery and want detox and all that . But once they get to detox they have nowhere sober to go . There’s nowhere—they don’t have family support . They don’t have friend support . The recovery houses around here are awesome , but it’s $ 100 a week . And when you been on the street for 2 to 3 years , you don’t have $ 100 a week to do that . Participants further described that this lack of access to longer term recovery services may lead to the resumption of drug use . A male participant , for instance , explained , “…in a week and a half time they [ drug treatment pro - gram ] had threw me out because I didn’t have the $ 100 they wanted . I couldn’t find a job ASAP like they were wanting . So I was kind of thrown back on the streets and [ resumed drug use ] . ” Insufficient withdrawal management Many participants described experiencing painful , unmanaged withdrawal symptoms during drug treatment which served as a barrier to their willingness to remain in and / or pursue future treatment . One 37 - year - old female participant described experiencing painful withdrawal symptoms during her engagement in a detox program , Page 5 of 10 Winiker et al . Harm Reduction Journal ( 2023 ) 20 : 69 which led to the perception that other PWID would be unlikely to pursue treatment due to fear of unmanaged withdrawal : I went to two different detox programs , and they were seven to ten days detox programs . Horrible , absolutely horrible , because they didn’t want to give you anything . They wanted you to lay there and detox with nothing , absolutely nothing , and I just think that’s unfair , because it’s hard doing it , and they should be able to give us something . I mean , I really think that a lot of the addicts out here , a lot of the heroin addicts , they would be more apt to go and get clean and go into a detox program if it was a medical detox and they gave them some kind of medicine or something to help them or some - thing like that , because most of the detox programs around here don’t , and I think it scares the crap out of people , and that’s why they don’t want to go do it , because that’s the one thing that I hear when I talk to people about it . That’s the one thing I hear . “I don’t want to do it because I know I’m going to get too sick , and they won’t give me anything . ” And , with those , I just , I think it’s inhumane honestly to do people that way . … if they want to help us and they want to improve our community and improve us as citizens and stuff like that , they need to be a little bit more humane about it because I just , I completely think that’s inhumane . A 33 - year - old male participant echoed this sentiment by explaining that the severity of his unmanaged with - drawal resulted in him leaving a treatment program : “I just—some people can go do it cold turkey , but when I went up there , they gave me medicine to do it [ stop using drugs ] , but it just wasn’t enough . I was still going through the sickness , so I walked out . ” Facilitators to sustained engagement in drug treatment and substance use cessation Medications for opioid use disorder Among our participants , many spoke positively about engaging in MOUD - based drug treatment programs . For example , a 27 - year - old male participant noted that receiving methadone changed how he perceived his rela - tionship with drug use : And then when I started going to the methadone clinic , I woke up one day and I told my girlfriend I said , “I’m done . ” And she said , “You’re done ? ” And I said , “I’m done . ” I said , “Take every needle , take everything that I’ve got to do anything was shooting dope [ and get rid of it ] . Another 34 - year - old female participant explained that receiving MOUD - based treatment stopped her physi - ological cravings for drugs , stating : “…when I was on it for about four months , it was the best . I didn’t have—I didn’t wake up thinking or wanting it [ opioids ] . It was like a miracle drug for me . ” Similarly , a 37 - year - old male par - ticipant described positive experiences with MOUDs : “… it worked , and I didn’t really think about it [ using drugs ] at all . ” Supportive healthcare providers While most participants described a range of barriers to drug treatment engagement , several highlighted positive experiences in which they felt supported . In particular , many participants emphasized the value of warmth and open communication from care providers and support staff within the programs at which they sought care . A 32 - year - old female recounted a highly positive encoun - ter with a treatment program , describing the care she received as “great” and “personalized , ” elaborating with : I mean you walk into the window , " Hi , blank , blank , " they know you by name , everybody , every patient . You’re not just a number . You see a doctor , a nurse on a daily basis , " How are you feeling ? " they ask you . And groups and therapy is just so amazing . It’s really nice over there . Another 40 - year - old female participant noted experi - encing a change in the quality of treatment she received from healthcare providers over time , stating : “…any of my regular doctors or anyone that I see—a lot more of them are being schooled on it [ addiction ] , and they’re a lot more compassionate instead of being very rude like they used to be . ” The experiences of these participants high - light the importance of person - centered care and mutu - ally respectful staff , provider , and client relationships as a means of facilitating treatment engagement among PWID . Discussion Through interviews with PWID in a rural county in West Virginia , we identified several barriers and facilitators to sustained engagement in drug treatment and substance use cessation . Participants described limited access to drug treatment programs and low thresholds for dis - missal , often for reasons that were outside of their con - trol . In addition , an overall lack of follow up and support services was described as a barrier to sustained recovery . Financial constraints were also reported among many participants , with prohibitive out - of - pocket expenses required for drug treatment engagement . Further , Page 6 of 10 Winiker et al . Harm Reduction Journal ( 2023 ) 20 : 69 inadequate management of withdrawal was described as an impediment to engaging in drug treatment and often led to resumption of drug use . MOUD - based drug treatment programs were , however , described as being highly effective and supported persons in their recovery through the management of cravings and withdrawal symptoms . Additionally , participants expressed that hav - ing supportive relationships with their healthcare provid - ers encouraged drug treatment engagement . Collectively , these findings demonstrate that the public health of rural PWID may be improved through the scaling up of low - threshold , evidence - based drug treatment and MOUD programs that emphasize person - centered , mutually sup - portive care . It is well documented that many federal and state policies negatively affect access to evidence - based OUD treatment programs , including policies which prevent the establishment of new opioid treatment centers or limit the number of patients who can be seen at a particular site for treatment [ 40 , 41 ] . Many interviewees were impacted by these policies , citing waitlists , program shortages , or the need to travel to other states due to the scarcity of local programs . This reaffirms findings from other studies which highlight that long distances and transportation barriers significantly limit access to treatment among PWID [ 42 , 43 ] . Despite the many barriers in place , all 21 participants reported having been engaged in at least one form of drug treat - ment in the past . However , many then faced low thresh - olds for dismissal and inadequate support services , which exacerbated risks for resuming drug use . While we do not have sufficient data to assess every participants’ reason ( s ) for termination of each of these past programs , this sug - gests that consistent retention remains a problem among persons who access treatment . Importantly , research has found that engagement with drug treatment programs for longer durations of time is associated with better outcomes [ 44 , 45 ] . For example , a recent study found that patients who participated in shorter - term treatment programs were at a heightened risk of resuming drug use compared to persons who engaged in longer programs [ 46 ] . Further , recent evalu - ations of MOUD programs have found that patients who remained in longer - term , continuous drug treatment experienced improved outcomes : drug treatment dura - tion was positively associated with drug use improve - ment , as measured by the frequency and type of drugs used [ 47 – 49 ] . One way to improve retention and substance use out - comes among PWID is the implementation of low - threshold , MOUD - based drug treatment programs that offer longer term , comprehensive services . Such pro - grams may be particularly beneficial given the prevalence of co - occurring mental health disorders among PWID . Specifically , multidisciplinary treatment models which incorporate mental health and substance use disorder treatment are associated with reductions in opioid use , mental health symptoms , and nights in jail [ 50 ] . Delivery of wraparound services ( a strengths - based model which incorporates team - based , coordinated care ) to individu - als in substance use treatment programs has also been shown to be positively associated with several indicators of treatment retention , including the number of treat - ment sessions attended and length of stay in treatment days [ 51 ] . Participants also described cost as a barrier to drug treatment engagement , underscoring the need for low - threshold access to services that is not conditioned upon one’s ability to pay . This finding is reflective of a lack of free , publicly funded OUD programming within the US , and overall insufficient health insurance coverage for drug treatment . For example , in 2018 , most Medicaid programs did not cover residential treatment , and many private insurers also excluded coverage to these pro - grams [ 52 ] . Research has also shown that 41 % of adults in treatment for illicit substance use pay for it on their own , suggesting that many low income individuals face cost as a barrier to any form of substance use treatment access [ 52 , 53 ] . While some treatment programs do accept pri - vate and / or public insurance , people experiencing an opi - oid use disorder are more likely to be uninsured , which further limits their access to care : as of 2016 , only 26 % of uninsured individuals with an opioid use disorder entered any form of drug treatment [ 54 ] . Further , unin - sured patients often face high out - of - pocket costs for MOUD : A 2014 Department of Health and Human Ser - vices report estimated that the median cost of buprenor - phine for individuals without insurance was $ 539 per month , compared to only $ 25 per month among those with commercial insurance [ 55 ] . However , persons with public insurance often face high out of pocket expenses and additional MOUD access barriers such as prior authorization requirements [ 55 , 56 ] . Eliminating these financial barriers to evidence - based drug treatment pro - grams is a necessary step toward improving the health of individuals with OUD . Among our participants , many reported experiencing painful withdrawal symptoms during times they engaged in drug treatment programs , particularly those which were abstinence based . Conversely , persons described MOUD - based drug treatment engagement as supportive of their efforts to achieve substance use cessation , high - lighting that the medications helped them manage with - drawal symptoms . Ideally , MOUD - based drug treatment programs should be rapidly scaled up throughout rural communities . However , achieving this goal will require Page 7 of 10 Winiker et al . Harm Reduction Journal ( 2023 ) 20 : 69 changes across the healthcare sector . While MOUD is recognized as the gold standard for management of per - sons with opioid use disorders , federal limitations on MOUD prescribing remain in place [ 6 , 21 ] . For example , until recently , prescribing of buprenorphine required the completion of a time - intensive regulatory approval pro - cess known as an X - waiver through the federal govern - ment . In 2016 , only 4 % of US physicians were waivered to prescribe buprenorphine , and 60 % of rural counties did not have a single waivered provider [ 57 ] . While the X - waiver requirement was overturned by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and Drug Enforcement Administration in January of 2023 , providers are still limited by federal law in the number of patients they may treat at one time with buprenor - phine [ 58 , 59 ] . In order to address additional barriers to MOUD treatment brought about by the COVID - 19 pandemic , states have seen the relaxation of some these prescribing restrictions . Specifically , the Drug Enforce - ment Administration and state regulators have enabled use of telehealth for MOUD prescribing , reduced restric - tions on take - home doses of methadone , and passed laws allowing primary care providers to prescribe MOUD across some state lines [ 60 – 63 ] . Efforts should be made to maintain these policy changes , even with the removal of the pandemic - related state of emergency within the US . Further , telehealth can serve as an important mecha - nism to expand MOUD access , and additional research is warranted to assess the impact of these policies on PWID residing in rural communities . Within the drug use treatment landscape , some per - sons draw a distinction between models promoting complete cessation ( i . e . , abstinence from use of any sub - stances , including MOUD ) , and maintenance ( i . e . , ces - sation from illicit substances through the controlled use of MOUD options such as buprenorphine and metha - done ) [ 64 ] . However , it is important that constituencies understand the evidence - base of MOUD utilization . Per - sons who utilize MOUD demonstrate greater treatment retention , decreased rates of resumption of drug use , and lower risk of overdose compared to persons engaged in abstinence - based treatment [ 65 , 66 ] . Our findings sug - gest that MOUD programs are seen as the most effective / desired option among participants , likely due in large part to the management of withdrawal symptoms and cravings . Despite the evidence , many policymakers and treat - ment providers continue to favor an abstinence - based treatment model [ 67 ] . Multiple studies have demon - strated that abstinence - focused programs create signifi - cant barriers to patient access , retention , and engagement [ 68 – 70 ] . Substantial research has further demonstrated that many PWID report experiences of stigmatization and mistreatment by healthcare providers , which result in delayed care seeking behaviors and decreased sub - stance use treatment engagement [ 71 – 73 ] . Targeted programs to reduce drug use stigma among healthcare providers have been called for as a means of reducing negative treatment of PWID and encouraging increased access to treatment for members of this population [ 71 ] . One such strategy involves comprehensive educational campaigns and training programs for providers who interact with PWID , particularly promoting integration of MOUD into medical practices and incorporating mes - saging that addiction is a disease , not a moral failing [ 20 , 74 ] . Further , cultural competency training that stresses the importance of person - first terminology can reduce expressions of judgment toward PWID from healthcare providers [ 75 ] . Importantly , several participants high - lighted that having open , respectful relationships with program staff and recovery service providers was a facili - tator of substance use cessation and treatment success . This further emphasizes the importance of anti - stigma campaigns within rural communities to ensure PWID are afforded compassionate , person - centered care . While these findings demonstrate several important barriers and facilitators to drug treatment engagement among rural PWID , they must be viewed in the context of several limitations . These data were collected in 2018 and therefore may not fully reflect the current scope of the drug treatment landscape , particularly given recent changes stemming from the COVID - 19 pandemic . Fur - ther , the experience of these participants may not be transferable to PWID who reside in other communities , especially those in urban settings . The limited availability of MOUD options in the state of West Virginia led some participants to utilize detoxification or abstinence - only programs , which may be a less likely outcome among persons in communities in which a greater range of pro - gram options exist . Given that PWID who do seek treat - ment are typically constrained by the options available within their geographic region , it would be valuable to conduct similar work in a range of settings to explore place - based differences in treatment access and reten - tion . Participants in this study were primarily white and male , limiting our ability to characterize differences in drug treatment experiences among women and other racial and ethnic groups . Finally , we did not collect data on participants’ education level , annual income , or other relevant indicators of socioeconomic status . Conclusions From 21 in - depth interviews conducted with PWID in Cabell County , West Virginia , we found numerous barri - ers which limited access to and retention in drug treat - ment . West Virginia has been hard hit by the opioid Page 8 of 10 Winiker et al . Harm Reduction Journal ( 2023 ) 20 : 69 crisis , and comprehensive solutions will be required to adequately support persons living with an opioid use disorder within the state . These first - person accounts provide important insights , underscoring opportunities to improve access to low - threshold and evidence - based drug treatment services to support substance use cessa - tion among PWID in rural communities .
