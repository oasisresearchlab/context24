Actin regulation is critical for primitive eukaryotes since it drives their key cellular processes . Entamoeba histolytica , a protist human pathogen harbours eleven proteins within this family , however , with no actin depolymerising protein reported to date . We present here the NMR model of EhActo , the ﬁ rst Co ﬁ lin from E . histolytica that severs actin ﬁ laments and also participates in cellular events like phagocytosis and pseudopod formation . The model typically represents the ADF - homology domain compared to other co ﬁ lins . Uniquely , EhActo lacks the critical Serine3 residue present in all known actophorins mediating its phospho - regulation . The second mode of regulation that co ﬁ lin ’ s are subjected to is via their interaction with 14 - 3 - 3 proteins through the phosphorylated Serine residue and a consensus binding motif . We found a unique interaction between EhActo and 14 - 3 - 3 without the presence of the consensus motif or the phosphorylated Serine . These interesting results present unexplored newer mechanisms functional in this pathogen to regulate actophorin . Through our structural and biochemical studies we have deciphered the mechanism of action of EhActo , implicating its role in amoebic biology .

Actin is subjected to several regulatory controls for precisely sculpting its function . This job has been assigned to several families of proteins that modulate actin dynamics . One of the widely studied regulators is the ADF / Co ﬁ lin ( AC ) superfamily , with its numerous members across all clades of organisms . AC proteins drive the motility and mechano - sensing activities in the cell ( Narita , 2020 ) . They restructure actin ﬁ laments continuously by both increasing the monomer dissociation , as well as severing the ﬁ laments ( Kanellos and Frame , 2016 ) . The implications of these protein interactions are of greater importance in single - celled organisms , such as the pathogenic Entamoeba histolytica . Thus , understanding the biological rami ﬁ cations of AC proteins would unravel the effects of actin depolymerisation working in them . AC family is recruited in the cell to recycle actin monomers ( Bamburg and Bernstein , 2008 ) . Some members accelerate monomer dissociation from pointed F - actin ends . They also bind twisted actin ﬁ laments to stabilize the kink , thereby augmenting their severing activity ( Bernstein and Bamburg , 2010 ) . Newer ﬁ laments ends are generated in the process that can be used for speedy polymerisation Edited by : Andres Ernesto Zucchetti , Institut Curie , France Reviewed by : Rodolfo Maximiliano Rasia , Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientí ﬁ cas y Técnicas ( CONICET ) , Argentina Dipak N .

If the actin monomer is largely sequestered , then the severing activity leads to a rapid decline in F - actin structures ( Xue and Robinson , 2013 ) . Thus , in conjunction with other regulators , ACs can function in increasing and decreasing F - actin in the cell . Actophorin was identi ﬁ ed as the ﬁ rst amoebic co ﬁ lin in Acanthamoeba castellani ( AcActo ) ( Cooper et al . , 1986 ) . It was named the “ actin carrying ” protein that bound both actin forms ( Maciver et al . , 1991b ; Blanchoin and Pollard , 1998 ; 1999 ) . It interacts strongly with ADP - actin while mediating a weaker interaction with ATP bound monomer ( Maciver and Weeds , 1994 ) . Further , actophorin and pro ﬁ lin share overlapping binding sites for actin , thus , participating in a competition for the same ( Blanchoin and Pollard , 1998 ) . Nonetheless , pro ﬁ lin and actophorin work synergistically to rapidly recycle actin monomers to add on to new branches created by the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Blanchoin et al . , 2000a ) . Actophorin was proposed to bind along the actin ﬁ laments with a predilection for bent F - actin nooks in a pH - insensitive manner ( Maciver et al . , 1991b ) . It accelerates the dissociation of γ - phosphate from F - actin to further promote de - branching ( Blanchoin et al . , 2000a ) . Surprisingly , amoebic Ca 2 + - F - actin was resistant to actophorin , while Mg 2 + - F - actin was rapidly severed by it ( Mossakowska and Korn , 1996 ) . Phosphorylation of the ﬁ rst Serine residue ( designated as Ser1 in AcActo and Ser3 in vertebrates ) by LIMK activated by PAK directly inhibits any actin interaction ( Blanchoin et al . , 2000b ) . In a moonlighting function , actophorin forms rigid α - actinin bound actin bundles that are less thixotropic ( Maciver et al . , 1991a ) . Multiple regulatory factors control AC activity in the cells . Phosphorylation and de - phosphorylation of Ser3 ( vertebrate nomenclature ) are one of the primary regulation circuits . Phospho - AC ( p - AC ) is the deactivated form such that it can neither bind actin nor sever it ( Agnew et al . , 1995 ; Pederson , 2008 ) . Ser3 is present at the binding interface of AC - actin ; thus , the phosphorylation blocks binding either through steric hindrance or by electrostatic repulsion with the net negative surface of actin ( Narita , 2020 ) . Studies conducted on S3D mutant ( mimics the p - AC form ) revealed the mechanistic details of how the p - AC is rendered inef ﬁ cient for severing activity ( Elam et al . , 2017 ) . The second regulatory molecule showcased is 14 - 3 - 3 , a ubiquitous protein family present in almost all cells . 14 - 3 - 3 regulates actin dynamics through various interactions with LIMK , TESK , SSH , and co ﬁ lin ( Ohashi , 2015 ) . 14 - 3 - 3 binds to the phosphorylated forms of these proteins and affects their functionality . A recent study reported , 14 - 3 - 3 recruited EhCoactosin during phagocytosis ( Agarwal et al . , 2019 ) . However , the 14 - 3 - 3 binding sites in EhCoactosin were not the canonical ones . The current study characterizes Entamoeba histolytica actophorin ( EhActo ) through various approaches . We have cloned and puri ﬁ ed EhActo to characterise its functional attributes . Our data reveals EhActo as the ﬁ rst true co ﬁ lin from Entamoeba , unlike the role reversal activity presented by EhCoactosin ( Kumar et al . , 2014 ) . It actively severs actin ﬁ laments as observed through ﬂ uorimetric and TEM analyses . Elucidation of the NMR model revealed the ADF - homology domain similar to EhCoactosin , however , with completely opposite biochemical activity . Critical differences in the sequence of EhActo , compared to other co ﬁ lins , unravel unique mechanisms for this family of proteins , yet to be tapped . EhActo was present in the phagocytic cups of the amoebic cells throughout the process of phagocytosis . Finally , EhActo interacts directly with EhP3 ( Entamoeba histolytica 14 - 3 - 3 protein isoform 3 ) , despite lacking the identi ﬁ ed 14 - 3 - 3 binding sites . These results hint at the unexplored differential regulatory mechanisms operational in this primitive pathogen . RESULTS Sequence Analysis Reveals the Absence of the Family De ﬁ ning Serine Residue in EhActo Only a handful of proteins are annotated as Actophorin in the Uniprot database ( UniProt , 2019 ) , that is , the co ﬁ lin homologue characterised from Acanthamoeba castellani ( AcActo ) . Other homologues are generally named ADF or co ﬁ lin in several other organisms . Entamoeba histolytica codes for 11 proteins with the ADF - H domain , with C4LVG4 ( EHI _ 197480 ) , labelled as actophorin ( Rath and Gourinath , 2020 ) . Ser1 phosphorylation of AcActo is one of the critical regulatory mechanisms ; however , EhActo lacks Serine at any of the ﬁ rst ﬁ ve residues ( Figure 1 ) . This opens up exciting avenues to search for unique regulatory pathways in this pathogen . Also , EhActo neither contains an NLS or NES sequence , unlike other co ﬁ lins ( Kalderon et al . , 1984 ; Munsie et al . , 2012 ) . Thus , EhActo should not be involved in shuttling actin monomers across the nucleus . Tracing the Phylogeny of EhActo In one of the previous studies , EhActo was present as the separately diverged protein branch compared to ACs from several organisms ( Maciver and Hussey , 2002 ) . EhActo shares maximum identity with ACs from fellow amoeboid protists , Acanthamoeba castellani and Capsaspora owczarzaki , followed by fungal counterparts . Surprisingly , it shares the least identity with the C - terminal ADF - H domain from EhTWF ( Supplementary Figure S1 ) . Also , where EhActo is 99 % identical to putative actophorin from E . dispar , with E . invadens that percentage scrolls down to 68 % . Hence , amoebic proteins continue to display a high degree of divergence from other organisms . EhActo Interacts With Only the Filamentous Form of Actin As a preliminary study , we analyzed the co - sedimentation of EhActo with F - actin . EhActo pelleted down with actin ﬁ laments after the ultracentrifugation ( Supplementary Figure S2 ) . Further , on the addition of EhActo to the actin ﬁ laments , the actin band was visible in the supernatant fraction . This explains the severing by EhActo , releasing the lighter ﬁ lament fragments .

Actophorin From E . histolytica resonance to characterize the actin - binding abilities of EhActo . Earlier reports on AcActo described both G - and F - actin binding activities for it . In the case of EhActo , we only found F - actin binding and depolymerising activity . When pyrene - actin was allowed to polymerise in the presence of increasing concentrations of EhActo , its kinetics was the same as the one for the actin alone sample ( Figure 2A ) . Hence , EhActo does not sequester G - actin to inhibit active polymerisation . However , when F - actin was incubated with various concentrations of EhActo , sharp depolymerisation was observed , comparable to the co ﬁ lin from Xenopus Laevis ( XAC ) , used as control . The depolymerisation reaction occurred within the ﬁ rst 30 s of the kinetic plot ( Figure 2B ) . The quantitative SPR experiments well rati ﬁ ed these qualitative observations . G - actin was immobilized on the gold chip , and different concentrations of EhActo were allowed to interact with it , but the sensograms displayed no binding between the two ( Figure 2C ) . However , when F - actin was immobilized , a concentration - dependent binding of EhActo was observed ( Figure 2D ) . A sharp curve was seen for association and dissociation kinetics with an overall af ﬁ nity constant of 249 nM . In both the curves , within the ﬁ rst few seconds of the reaction , the maximal activity was observed . EhActo constantly displayed only F - actin binding through the co - sedimentation assay , spectro ﬂ uorometry , and SPR . Capturing EhActo in its Severing Action Fluorescence spectrometric analysis points towards the depolymerising activity of EhActo . We used TEM and SEM to visualise the same in action . In order to do so , we incubated F - actin for a few seconds before loading the sample onto the grid . F - actin alone formed long ﬁ laments , as shown in Figure 3A . When 1 μ M EhActo was allowed to act on these polymers , it produced severed actin ﬁ laments using a chopping mechanism . This severing action is comparable to AcActo , the other amoebic homologue ( Maciver et al . , 1991b ) . Similarly , when we visualised SEM images , long ﬁ laments of actin were present in the control sample , and ( 1 μ M ) EhActo drastically reduced the ﬁ lament lengths as discernible at ×1 , 000 magni ﬁ cation ( Figure 3B ) . An even closer look at ×10 , 000 magni ﬁ cation captured the severed actin ﬁ laments lying close to each other . Hence , EM studies corroborated the SPR and ﬂ uorescence studies , revealing the severing mechanism of FIGURE2 | EhActo preferentially binds to actin ﬁ laments only . The actin - binding activity ofEhActo wasmonitored qualitativelyby ﬂ uorescence spectrometry ( A , B ) and quantitatively by Surface Plasmon Resonance ( SPR ) ( C , D ) . ( A ) 10 % pyrene labelled actin monomers ( 4 μ M ) were allowed to polymerise for 10 min . EhActo was added to subsequent reactionswith increasing concentrations ; however , there wasno changeobserved inthe actin polymerisation . ( B ) 10 % pyrene ( 4 μ M ) F - actinwas allowed to self - depolymerise in the control reaction . 250 nM XAC ( Xenopus co ﬁ lin ) was taken as the positive control for actin depolymerisation . EhActo rapidly depolymerised F - actin in a concentration - dependent trend . ( C ) The SPR sensor grams obtained when G - actin was immobilised onto the chips , displayed no signi ﬁ cant binding between the two . ( D ) Neat association and dissociation curves were observed when EhActo interacted with the immobilised F - actin molecules . The af ﬁ nity constant for this interaction was calculated to be 249 nM .

This activity is similar to other studies of actophorin / ADF proteins . Structural Details of EhActo Revealed by NMR Studies Several ADF / co ﬁ lin structures are now available in PDB for analysis ; however , for actophorin , only two structures are present from Acanthamoeba species . NMR studies unravelled EhActo structural details , and we found that it contains four α helices and two small helices caging ﬁ ve antiparallel β sheets . This is a typical secondary structure pattern of the AC family of proteins where a central core of β - sheet is surrounded by α - helices . α 1 ( 2 – 5 ) and α 5 ( 123 – 126 ) are single half - turn helices , while α 4 ( 94 – 110 ) is the longest one . α 2 ( 10 – 22 ) and α 3 ( 51 – 57 ) parallel each other in the plane . β 1 ( 26 – 32 ) and β 3 ( 65 – 74 ) are parallel to each other and are antiparallel to β 2 ( 39 – 46 ) , β 4 ( 77 – 88 ) , and β 5 ( 116 – 120 ) . It also ﬂ aunts the family de ﬁ ning FIGURE3 | EhActoseversactin ﬁ laments . ( A ) TEMand ( B ) SEMwereusedtovisualiseEhActoinaction .

Actophorin From E . histolytica F - loop that is involved in F - actin binding . α 6 ( 128 – 138 ) is present very close to F - loop ; thus , it could provide additional contact points for F - actin . The N - terminal and C - terminal ends lie diagonally opposite to each other ( Figure 4 ) . Structural Homologues of EhActo Display Differences We compared EhActo model with other ACs from Entamoeba histolytica , itself since they share the least sequence homology . Acanthamoeba castellanii ( AcActo ) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae ( ScCof ) co ﬁ lins were also analyzed for their structural variations to correlate with functional altercations . AcActo ( PDB ID : 1AHQ ) is currently the sole Actophorin with a PDB available in the database . With an alignment of 133 residues , we obtained an RMSD of 2 . 1 Å between AcActo and EhActo . A comparison with yeast Co ﬁ lin ( ScCof ) ( PDB ID : 1CFY ) , EhCoactosin ( PDB ID : 4LIZ ) , and NT FIGURE 4 | NMR model of EhActo reveals structural conservation of ADF / Co ﬁ linfamily .

( C ) Yeast co ﬁ lin ( Magenta ) is one of the well - studied proteins , and so we also used it in our analyses . Except for NT EhTWF , alltheother proteins had theF - loop thatisasignature ofthisfamilyofproteins . Overall , thestructuralfeatureswerefound tobeconservedamongstall of them . Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology | www . frontiersin . org February 2022 | Volume 10 | Article 785680 6 Kumar et al . Actophorin From E . histolytica EhTWF ( PDB ID : 6K2F ) yielded RMSD values of 2 . 1 , 2 . 6 , and 2 . 7 Å , respectively ( Fedorov et al . , 1997 ; Leonard et al . , 1997 ; Kumar et al . , 2014 ) . Few marked variations were visible on comparison ; the N - terminal end was longer in EhActo with an added small helix ( Ala2 to Gly5 ) . β 2 of AcActo was very small with respect to β 2 of EhActo ( Figure 5A ) . The most extended helix ( α 4 ) was bent in all structures except EhActo , where it was more straightened out . The angular variation ismaximumwithAcActo and ScCofandminimum with NT EhTWF ( Figure 5D ) . There is no helix corresponding to EhActo α 5 in ScCof and AcActo . The last helix was longer and tilted away from the core in EhActo . ScCof has an additional β sheet at its N - terminal , unlike any other protein ( Figure 5B ) . The distorted last helix of EhCoactosin encompasses both α 5 and α 6 of EhActo ( Figure 5C ) . Also , β 3 and β 4 are the shortest in EhCoactosin , while α 2 is the longest in NT EhTWF . Finally , NT EhTWF has two signi ﬁ cant differences : the C - terminal α helix is bent inwards , lacks the F - loop , and is present in all other homologues . The minor differences observed in the structure explains some of the functional variations . As mentioned earlier , unlike all other homologues , EhActo lacks monomeric G - actin binding . The critical secondary and tertiary structural changes like longer N - terminal terminal end with additional small helix and the orientation of the last helix could be asserting the altered functional role for EhActo , since these fall in the actin - binding interface . Unique Surface Charge Distribution Pattern of EhActo AC family has a unique surface charge signature , with one face of positive residues , while the opposite faces negatives . ScCof was an ideal example for the same ( Supplementary Figure S3A ) . EhCoactosin was surprisingly different , with both surfaces being negative ( Supplementary Figure S3B ) . NT EhTWF has the third variation of major hydrophobic regions covering the entire structure ( Supplementary Figure S3C ) . AcActo follows the typical AC pattern of surface charge distribution ; however , the α 3 is positively charged on both faces ( Supplementary Figure S3D ) . α 3 , along with positively charged C - terminal , have been implicated as actin - binding region ( Fedorov et al . , 1997 ; Leonard et al . , 1997 ) . In the case of EhActo , these particular regions tell a different story ( Supplementary Figure S3E ) . The C - terminal end is relatively more negatively charged , while α 3 carries a lesser positive charge with hydrophobicity . The loop before the C - terminal helix and the helix itself is known to bind actin molecules ( Paavilainen et al . , 2008 ) . Another major point for consideration is that the F - loop in EhActo is entirely negative with intermittent hydrophobic residues , while in AcActo , it is negative on one face and positive on the other . The surface charge distribution observed in EhActo is markedly different from other homologues . Typically , AC family proteins project one negative and one positive surface , as seen in ScCof . However , AC family proteins from E . histolytica tend to break the norm ; EhCoactosin is mainly negative , while NT EhTWF displays more number of hydrophobic regions . Similarly , EhActo contains both negative and hydrophobic surface areas . Except for EhActo , all the other homologues bind both forms of actin . On the other hand , EhCoactosin and NT EhTWF stabilize actin ﬁ laments rather than depolymerising them . EhActo Localises Near Membrane in Entamoeba histolytica We performed immuno ﬂ uorescence - staining studies using antibodies raised against puri ﬁ ed recombinant EhActo ( Figure 6A ) . EhActo was observed to be concentrated near the plasma membrane as visualized by confocal microscopy ( Figure 6B ) . However , it was ubiquitously present throughout the cytoplasm as well . The localisation of EhActo was seen parallel with actin all along with the pseudopod formation ( Figure 6C ) . EhActo was present at the tips of the actin - rich phagocytic cups during the presence of red blood cells , during erythrophagocytosis . The protein was constantly present till the closure of the phagocytic cups ( Figure 6D ) . Hence , the involvement of EhActo is to regulate the basal level of actin dynamics , in general , near the membrane of this pathogen . The presence of EhActo at the site of pseudopod formation is critically vital for the rapid actin turnover required during motility . Earlier studied amoebic proteins like EhCoactosin , EhARPC1 and EhARPC2 , EhMyosin1b , EhP3 , EhLIMA , EhRho1 , EhNCABP166 , enter and exit the phagocytic cup formation site at different stages ( Voigt et al . , 1999 ; Wender et al . , 2007 ; Campos - Parra et al . , 2010 ; Kumar et al . , 2014 ; Babuta et al . , 2015 ; Babuta et al . , 2018 ; Bharadwaj et al . , 2018 ; Agarwal et al . , 2019 ; Gautam et al . , 2019 ) . However , the omnipresence of EhActo throughout all the cellular processes like motility and erythrophagocytosis explains its critical importance in amoebic biology . EhActo Induces Conformational Changes in F - Actin As stated above , our biochemical data identi ﬁ ed that EhActo binds and severs F - actin only . The electron microscopy data clearly displayed the severing action ; therefore , we superimposed EhActo onto the co ﬁ lin bound F - actin structure ( PDB ID : 5YU8 ) to understand the binding mechanism . A comparison between unbound ( PDB ID : 7BT7 ) ( Figure 7A ) and EhActo bound F - actin displayed structural changes that explain the action of EhActo . Both the structures superimposed with an RMSD of 2 . 7 Å . As visible in Figure 7B , the binding of EhActo resulted in a more open conformation for F - actin , thus loosening the polymer . There was signi ﬁ cant angular and translational displacement between the two structures . All the actin molecules displaced outwards , away from the central axis ( arrow marked in Figure 7B ) . These parameters are tabulated to show the relative movement of the monomers ( Table 1 ) . When we zoom in to look at the EhActo - F - actin interface , we can see two primary contact points . A single molecule of EhActo contacts two actin molecules . On one end , the interactions are mediated by F - loop and the C - terminal helix ( α 6 ) ( Figure 7D ) , while the N - terminal end and α 4 contact the second actin molecule ( Figure 7C ) . These interactions are very similar to other reported co ﬁ lins . These interacting regions are oriented differently when compared to other homologues , thus explaining the functional distinction . The direction of α 6 is signi ﬁ cant in mediating actin contacts in the case of EhActo .

Actophorin From E . histolytica EhP3 ( 14 - 3 - 3 ) Interacts Directly With EhActo Three recognition motifs have been characterised in 14 - 3 - 3 binding partners that contain phosphoSer / Thr ( p S / p T ) ( Bridges and Moorhead , 2005 ) . Motif I : ( RSX p S / p TXP ) , Motif II : ( RXY / FX p S / p TXP ) , and Motif III : p S / p TX1 - 2 - COOH , where X is any amino acid except Proline . However , a couple of other sequence motifs were also located on the non - phosphorylated substrates : GHSL and WLDLE ( Ferl et al . , 2002 ) . The discovery of these new binding sites presents broader roles for 14 - 3 - 3 proteins than just being phosho - sensors . Surprisingly , in the case of EhActo , the sequence analysis revealed that none of these motif signatures is present in it . A recent article by Agarwal et al . ( 2019 ) described the presence of three 14 - 3 - 3 isoforms ( namely EhP1 , EhP2 , and EhP3 ) in Entamoeba histolytica . The work reported EhCoactosin ’ s interaction with EhP3 , despite the lack of a consensus 14 - 3 - 3 binding site , we were intrigued to analyze the same for EhActo ( Agarwal et al . , 2019 ) . It is already published that EhP3 does not interact with actin ( Agarwal et al . , 2019 ) and ( Supplementary Figure S4 ) ; thus , for qualitative assessment , we deployed a co - sedimentation assay , where we incubated F - actin with EhP3 and EhActo . The presence of FIGURE 6 | Cellular localisation of EhActo in the amoebic trophozoites .

Actophorin From E . histolytica EhActo increased the presence of EhP3 in the pellet fraction ( Figure 8A ) . Thus , EhActo probably bridges a connection between EhP3 and actin , similar to EhCoactosin . Next , we used SPR interaction kinetics to validate the direct protein - protein interaction ( Rath et al . , 2020 ) . We found that EhActo binds to EhP3 with an af ﬁ nity constant of 1 μ M ( Figure 8B ) . EhP3 controls the recruitment of EhCoactosin at the phagocytic cups , wherein the decrease in the cellular concentration of EhP3 delayed phagocytosis . Thus , EhP3 could be deploying a similar carrier function for EhActo , although this awaits further validation . DISCUSSION Discovered as the amoebic homologue of Co ﬁ lin , actophorin has since displayed all the characteristics of the ADF / Co ﬁ lin family proteins . The protein was earlier studied in Acanthamoeba , the soil - dwelling protist . We have extended the study to understand the same protein in Entamoeba histolytica , the enteric protozoan FIGURE7 | BindingofEhActotoactin ﬁ laments , asexplainedthroughmodellingstudies .

Actophorin From E . histolytica globally infecting humans . Although both the proteins are amoebic homologues , they share just 47 % sequence identity . The most distinctive feature for EhActo is the absence of the regulatory Serine residue at its N - terminal . Ser1 ( AcActo ) or Ser3 ( mammalian Co ﬁ lin ) are subjected to phosphocycling as a switch to regulate it . This opens the possibility of a different mechanism operational in Entamoeba histolytica for the actophorin regulation . One of the key ﬁ ndings of our study was the inability of EhActo to interact with G - actin , as shown by pyrenyl - actin ﬂ uorescence and SPR studies . Unlike AcActo , EhActo interacted with only the ﬁ lament form of actin . A Co ﬁ lin peptide WAPESAPLKSKM was reported to be the site of G - actin interaction ( Yonezawa et al . , 1991 ) . However , in EhActo , there are signi ﬁ cant substitutions at this region with the following sequence , WTPEGCKIREKM ( Figure 1 ) . These residue changes could explain the lack of G - actin binding by EhActo . In the co - sedimentation assay , we found actin in the supernatant fraction upon addition of EhActo that hinted at the depolymerising / severing action . Fluorescence studies revealed the fast kinetics of the depolymerisation activity and visualization through TEM , and SEM further con ﬁ rmed the severing action of EhActo . We determined the model of EhActo using NMR spectroscopy , and the model was typical of the AC family , with few variations . Our model of EhActo - F - actin projects the structural changes induced upon the binding of EhActo . The overall F - actin broadens outwards from the central axis . The F - loop , α 4 , α 6 , and the N - terminal are the contact regions for two adjacent actin monomers in the ﬁ lament . EhActo co - localized with actin in the amoebic trophozoites and lined the membrane . The location of EhActo at the membranes can be explained by the presence of the conserved basic amino acid residues at positions 93 and 95 that are known to bind PIP 2 present in the membrane ( Van Troys et al . , 2000 ) . Thus , EhActo probably associates with PIP 2 all the time in the cells . It was present at the tips of pseudopods and phagocytic cups . EhActo remained at the tips till their closure during erythrophagocytosis . Our data displays cellular localization of EhActo during cellular motility and phagocytosis . The analysis reveals that cells are polarized during phagocytosis via different regulatory pathways recruiting certain proteins at phagocytic site . EhActo probably aids in actin monomer recycling by rapid depolymerization . This activity is crucial during the formation of phagosomes , as the pseudopods need to ﬁ rst progress in order to capture their prey and then regress to engulf it . Direct SPR studies revealed association of EhP3 with EhActo at concentrations above 1 μ M . These results were surprisingly different from the predictions . Firstly , EhActo does not contain any consensus 14 - 3 - 3 binding motifs , yet it interacts with good af ﬁ nity . Secondly , EhActo lacks the Ser1 ( counterpart of mammalian Ser3 ) residue whose phosphorylation is essential for the 14 - 3 - 3 binding mechanism . Since our studies used proteins puri ﬁ ed from the E . coli cells , they most probably do not carry any posttranslational modi ﬁ cations like phosphorylation . Hence , the two earlier described necessary conditions , phosphorylated Serine and 14 - 3 - 3 recognition motifs are rendered dispensable in amoebic EhActo . Thus , in conclusion , the discovery of an alternate binding mechanism for 14 - 3 - 3 can be pencilled in , and , therefore , further studies are required to understand these potential differences . Thus , in conclusion , we report the ﬁ rst co ﬁ lin from Entamoeba histolytica . The earlier reported AC family protein EhCoactosin failed to depolymerise / sever actin ﬁ laments ( Kumar et al . , 2014 ) . Functionally , EhActo behaves similar to the EhCoactosin Δ F mutant that lacks the actin - binding F - loop . However , EhActo is fully capable of severing the actin ﬁ laments and works in actin regulation during basic processes in Entamoeba histolytica trophozoites . Presence of EhActo at phagocytic cup formation explains its function of active depolymerisation required for rapid actin dynamics during FIGURE8 | EhP3interactswithactin via ADF / Co ﬁ lins . ( A ) F - actincosedimentationassaywasperformedwithEhActoandEhP3 . WiththeadditionofEhActo , there was an increase of EhP3 in the pellet fractions along with F - actin . Actin and EhP3 were maintained at a constant concentration of 5 μ M in all the reactions . Sample 1 is actin only control ; sample 2 , 2 . 5 μ M EhActo ; sample 3 , 5 μ M EhActo ; and sample 4 , 10 μ M EhActo . ( B ) These ﬁ ndings were corroborated by SPR studies , where EhP3 was immobilised on the sensor chips while the increasing concentration of EhActo were passed in the running buffer to determine the binding af ﬁ nity . The af ﬁ nity constant for EhActo was 1 μ M . Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology | www . frontiersin . org February 2022 | Volume 10 | Article 785680 10 Kumar et al . Actophorin From E . histolytica phagocytosis . Hence , involvement of EhActo during its virulence factor describes it as the single co ﬁ lin present aiding the amoebic pathogenesis via phagocytosis . MATERIALS AND METHODS Cloning and Puri ﬁ cation of EhActo The gene corresponding to the amoebaDB ID : EHI _ 197480 was annotated as actophorin , hereafter referred as EhActo . It was cloned in pET28 ( b ) vector between the Nco I and Xho I restriction sites . The clone was overexpressed in BL21 ( DE3 ) cells for the generation of recombinant protein with a C - terminal His 6 tag . Ni - NTA chromatography was used as the ﬁ rst step of the puri ﬁ cation in a buffer with 100 mM Tris pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 1 mM EDTA , and 5 mM β - Mercaptoethanol . The protein was eluted in a buffer with 100 mM Imidazole . The second step Gel ﬁ ltration chromatographic puri ﬁ cation was performed in G75 superdex column ( GE Healthcare ) . The protein eluted as a monomer and was concentrated in a Millipore centricon of 5 kDa cutoff . Sequence and Phylogenetic Analyses All the homologous sequences were extracted from the UniProt database ( UniProt , 2019 ) and were aligned by ClustalW in the MEGA 7 software suite . The resultant alignment was used to generate the phylogenetic tree by the Maximum Likelihood method based on the Jones - Taylor - Thornton model ( Kumar et al . , 2016 ) . 500 bootstrap replicates were deployed to generate phylogenetic tree . The tree with the maximum score was selected and the ﬁ nal ﬁ gure was prepared by iTOL ( Letunic and Bork , 2019 ) . All the sequences used have been tabulated and provided as Supplementary Table S1 . Protein Preparation for NMR Spectroscopy For the preparation of isotopic labeled U - 15 N or U - 13 C , 15 N — labeled recombinant protein , 2 . 5 g L − 1 13 C 6 - D - glucose and 1 . 0 g L − 1 15 NH 4 Cl ( Cambridge Isotope Laboratories ) , as sole carbon and nitrogen sources , respectively , in M9 minimal media , yielding the uniformly 13 C , 15 N - labeled protein . The NMR buffer used for ﬁ nal protein preparations comprised 10 mM sodium phosphate pH 7 . 0 , 1 . 8 mM potassium phosphate , 60 mM NaCl , 2 . 7 mM KCl and 5 % D 2 O . Actin Filament Depolymerisation Assay 10 % pyrene labelled G - actin at a concentration of 10 μ M was polymerised to F - actin for one and a half hour in the F - buffer ( 10 mM Tris - Cl pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 2 mM DTT , 0 . 7 mM ATP , 50 mM KCl , and 2 . 0 mM MgCl 2 ) . Thus formed F - actin was subjected to depolymerisation kinetics . 4 μ l of actin in 66 μ l F - buffer was taken in the quartz cuvette in a reaction volume of 80 μ l completed with HKG5 buffer ( 20 mM HEPES pH 7 . 5 , 50 mM KCl , and 5 % Glycerol ) or EhActo . QM 40 PTI NJ ﬂ uorimeter was used to monitor N - pyrene ﬂ uorescence ( excitation wavelength at 365 nm , emission wavelength at 407 nm ) for 600 s . We used Xenopus co ﬁ lin1 ( Xac1 ) , a known actin - depolymerising factor , as the positive control ( Rosenblatt et al . , 1997 ) . Actin Co - Sedimentation Assay 5 µM rabbit muscle G - actin was polymerised in F - Buffer ( 10 mM Tris - Cl pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 2 mM DTT , 0 . 5 mM ATP , 50 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 ) for 1 . 5 h at room temperature . 5 µM of EhActo ( or F - Buffer ) was added to the hence formed F - actin and the reaction volume was made up to 150 µl . Reaction mixture was incubated for 30 min at room temperature . The samples were then ultra - centrifuged at 100 , 000 g for 45 min at 4 ° C . After centrifugation , the supernatant was pipetted out and the pellet fractions were reconstituted in F - Buffer . These were analyzed on a 12 % SDS - PAGE after the Coomassie blue staining . In the case of EhP3 experiments , both actin and EhP3 were used at 5 µM concentration , with variable EhActo concentrations . Similarly , G - actin binding was also analyzed as well . 5 µM rabbit muscle G - actin in G - buffer ( 10 mM Tris - Cl pH8 . 0 , 0 . 2 mM DTT , 0 . 5 mM ATP ) was either incubated alone or with EhActo ( and EhP3 ) half an hour at room temperature . Ultra - centrifugation was performed at 100 , 000 g for 45 min at 4 ° C . Supernatant and pellet fractions were separately collected and analyzed on 12 % SDS - PAGE post Coomassie blue staining . Surface Plasmon Resonance SPR studies using Autolab ESPIRIT were used to determine the binding af ﬁ nities between various protein molecules . Here , we followed the general protocol ( Rath et al . , 2020 ) , where , G - actin , F - actin , or EhP3 ( E . histolytica 14 - 3 - 3 protein isoform 3 ) were immobilised ( separately on three different chips ) to the activated sensor surface at a concentration of 10 µM in ﬁ ltered ( 0 . 22 µm pore size ) and degassed 10 mM sodium acetate buffer ( pH 4 . 5 ) . The chip surface was blocked using 100 mM ethanolamine at pH 8 . 5 . Regeneration was carried out by 50 mM NaOH . The running buffer used for the experiments were : G - actin running buffer : 10 mM HEPES , 0 . 2 mM Calcium Acetate , 0 . 5 mM DTT , 0 . 2 mM ATP and 0 . 005 % Triton - X100 , F - actin running buffer : 10 mM HEPES , 150 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 and 0 . 005 % Triton - X100 , EhP3 running buffer : 10 mM HEPES , 0 . 2 mM Calcium Acetate , 0 . 005 % Triton - X100 . The association kinetics ( 300 s ) and subsequent dissociation kinetics ( 150 s ) were recorded . Different concentrations of EhActo were used to obtain the KD values . The data collection performed at 25 ° C and Autolab SPR Kinetic Evaluation software was used for data analysis . Solution - State NMR Spectroscopy Samples of 0 . 5 mM Actophorin protein was prepared in the buffer containing 10 mM sodium phosphate pH 7 . 0 , 1 . 8 mM potassium phosphate , 60 mM NaCl , 2 . 7 mM KCl and 5 % D 2 O . Bruker Avance III spectrometer equipped with a 5 mm cryogenic triple resonance TCI probe was used for the acquisition of the NMR experiments at the ﬁ eld strength of 500 . 15 MHz . Temperature used for acquisition of all the experiments was 298 K . For the assignment of protein resonances , experiments used were double and triple resonance experiments ( Bax and Grzesiek , 1993 ) , that is , 2 D ( 15 N , 1 H ) HSQC , 2 D ( 13 C , 1 H ) HSQC ( aliphatic and aromatic ) , 3D HNCA , 3D HNCACB , 3D Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology | www . frontiersin . org February 2022 | Volume 10 | Article 785680 11 Kumar et al . Actophorin From E . histolytica CBCAcoNH , 3D HNCO ; for backbone resonance assignment , and 3D HcccoNH , 3D hCccoNH ; for side chain resonance assignment . The spectra were processed using Topspin 3 . 1 ( Bruker AG ) . Computer Aided Resonance Assignment ( CARA ) software was used for analysis and all assignments ( Keller , 2004 ) . Solution Structure Model Generation Using NMR Chemical Shifts The backbone and side - chain resonances were manually assigned using Computer Aided Resonance Assignment ( CARA ) software . The 1 H shifts were calibrated with respect to the 2 , 2 - dimethyl - 2 - silapentane - 5 - sulfonate ( DSS ) at 298 K ( 0 . 0 ppm ) . Indirect referencing of 13 C and 15 N shifts was done indirectly in all the spectra with respect to the DSS methyl proton resonance at 0 ppm . The conformational information derived from the assignments was used for the calculation of the 3D structure model using the CS - ROSETTA software ( Shen et al . , 2008 ) . 2D [ 15 N , 1 H ] HSQC of EhActo is provided in Supplementary Figure S5 . The NMR assignment has been uploaded to the Biological Magnetic Resonance Bank ( BMRB 51258 ) . We have further added the C α secondary Chemical shift graph as Supplementary Figure S6 . Superimposition of the Structural Homologues and Surface Charge Analyses Structural comparisons were conducted with the earlier characterised ADF - H domain containing proteins from Entamoeba histolytica , namely , EhCoactosin ( PDB : 4LIZ ) , NT EhTWF ( PDB : 6K2F ) . Also , we procured PDBs for yeast Co ﬁ lin ( PDB : 1CFY ) and Acanthamoeba Actophorin ( PDB : 1AHQ ) . A one on one superimposition was performed with the RAPIDO server ( Mosca and Schneider , 2008 ) . For the surface charge distribution , the ABPS plugin was used in the Pymol software , with a range of - 5 ( Red ) to + 5 ( Blue ) . The images were prepared with the Pymol software ( DeLano , 2002 ) . Modelling of EhActo - F - Actin Electron microscopy derived model of co ﬁ lin decorated F - actin ( 5YU8 ) ( Tanaka et al . , 2018 ) was used as the template to superimpose EhActo onto the co ﬁ lin present in the structure . 132 residues aligned with a RMSD of 2 . 41 Å using the RAPIDO sever ( Mosca and Schneider , 2008 ) . This ﬁ nal model with three EhActo and ﬁ ve actin molecules was subjected to energy minimization cycles using YASARA server ( Krieger and Vriend , 2014 ) . Finally , Pymol was used to create the ﬁ gures ( DeLano , 2002 ) . Transmission Electron Microscopy The actin ﬁ laments were viewed in a Transmission Electron Microscope ( JEOL JEM - 2100F ) with 200 kV accelerating voltage . Control reaction was setup with 5 μ M F - Actin alone . For experiments with EhActo , 5 μ M F - Actin was incubated with it for a couple of minutes . The samples were then adsorbed onto carbon coated copper 400 mesh grids and extra ﬂ uid was removed after 2 min of adsorption . Grids were negatively stained using 1 % uranyl acetate . Images were captured at ×10 , 000 , ×25 , 000 , and ×50 , 000 . Scanning Electron Microscopy Proteins are generally not visualized using SEM , however , since actin ﬁ laments are high molecular weight protein polymers , we tried to look at them through SEM . 5 μ M F - Actin was used as control sample , while 5 μ M F - Actin incubated with 250 nM EhActo was setup for experimental sample . A very thin ﬁ lm of gold and palladium ( Au – Pd ) was deposited on the surface of the samples to make them electrically conductive using the vacuum coating unit . This extremely ﬁ ne coating was done through the evaporation of Au – Pd plate under inert atmosphere ( argon environment ) . These samples were mounted on electron microprobe stubs . The SEM analyses were carried out with the help of a computer - controlled ﬁ eld emission SEM ( JEOL JSM - 6330F , JEOL Ltd . , Akishima , Tokyo , Japan ) . The samples were viewed at ×250 , ×500 , ×1 , 000 , and ×10 , 000 magni ﬁ cations . Growth and Maintenance of Parasite Entamoeba histolytica Strain HM1 - IMSS The standard protocol as described in several earlier publications was followed for the growth and maintenance of E . histolytica strain HM - 1 : IMSS ( Kumar et al . , 2014 ) . TYI - S - 33 medium was used with 125 μ l of 250 U ml − 1 benzyl penicillin and 0 . 25 mg ml − 1 streptomycin per 100 ml of medium . Immuno ﬂ uorescence Staining Immuno ﬂ uorescence staining protocol was followed as described previously ( Kumar et al . , 2014 ) . Brie ﬂ y E . histolytica cells were resuspended in the TYI - 33 medium and were then transferred and allowed to adhere on the acetone - cleaned coverslips for 10 min at 35 . 5 ° C . After the removal of the medium , the cells were ﬁ xed with 3 . 7 % pre - warmed paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) for 30 min . The ﬁ xed cells were treated with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 / PBS for 1 min for permeabilisation . This step was omitted for non - permeabilized cells . After a PBS wash , quenching was performed for 30 min with 50 mM NH 4 Cl in PBS . 1 % BSA / PBS was used for blocking the coverslips for 30 min . The primary antibody was then added followed by an incubation at 37 ° C for 1 h . Before incubation with the secondary antibody , the cover slips were washed with PBS followed by another blocking step with 1 % BSA / PBS of 30 min at 37 ° C . Antibody dilutions used were : Anti - EhActo at 1 : 3 , 000 , TRITC - Phalloidin at 1 : 250 and anti - rabbit Alexa 488 ( Molecular Probes ) at 1 : 300 . The samples prepared were washed with PBS again before mounting on a glass slide using DABCO ( 1 , 4 - diazbicyclo ( 2 , 2 , 2 ) octane ( Sigma ) 10 mg ml − 1 in 80 % glycerol ) . Nail polish was applied to seal the edges of the coverslip . Confocal images were collected and viewed using an Olympus FluoView FV1000 laser - scanning microscope .
