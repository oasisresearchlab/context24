CELL SCIENCE AT A GLANCE Clathrin - mediated endocytosis in budding yeast at a glance Rebecca Lu , David G . Drubin * and Yidi Sun ABSTRACT Clathrin - mediated endocytosis is an essential cellular process that involves the concerted assembly and disassembly of many different proteins at the plasma membrane . In yeast , live - cell imaging has shown that the spatiotemporal dynamics of these proteins is highly stereotypical . Recent work has focused on determining how the timing and functions of endocytic proteins are regulated . In this Cell Science at a Glance article and accompanying poster , we review our current knowledge of the timeline of endocytic site maturation and discuss recent works focusing on how phosphorylation , ubiquitylation and lipids regulate various aspects of the process . KEY WORDS : Saccharomyces cerevisiae , Actin , Clathrin - mediated endocytosis , Phospholipids , Phosphorylation , Ubiquitylation Introduction Clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) is a highly conserved essential cellular process by which external materials , integral membrane proteins and membrane phospholipids are internalized into the cell . The internalization of these materials is accomplished through deformation of the plasma membrane by a two - dimensional protein lattice , comprising clathrin and associated proteins . The canonical model in both yeast and mammalian cells is that the clathrin lattice and the underlying plasma membrane invaginate to form clathrin - coated pits ( CCP ) , which eventually pinch off from the plasma membrane as clathrin - coated vesicles ( CCV ) ( Kirchhausen et al . , 2014 ) . The CCV is then uncoated , and the resulting vesicle fuses with early endosomes , where cargo is sorted for degradation or recycling Department of Molecular and Cell Biology , University of California , Berkeley , CA 94720 , USA . * Author for correspondence ( drubin @ berkeley . edu ) 1531 © 2016 .

CME is especially important for the regulation of ligand - mediated receptor tyrosine kinase signaling pathways , such as epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) and insulin receptor ( INSR ) signaling ; here , CME functions to internalize ligand - bound receptors from the plasma membrane for their routing to the endosomal membrane systems ( reviewed in Di Fiore and von Zastrow , 2014 ; Goh and Sorkin , 2013 ) . Although CME generally maintains cellular homeostasis , it can also be hijacked for entry into cells by certain viruses and bacteria , such as influenza A and Listeria ( McMahon and Boucrot , 2011 ) . The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been an invaluable model organism for studying CME . The major route into the cell is mediated by clathrin , although it is interesting to note that a clathrin - independent endocytosis ( CIE ) pathway in S . cerevisiae has been found ( Prosser et al . , 2011 ) and is involved in a specific form of α - arrestin - regulated receptor internalization ( Prosser et al . , 2015 ) . Budding yeast is amenable to molecular genetic manipulations , making it possible to genetically tag proteins of interest with fluorescent proteins in order to study their localization and dynamics at endogenous levels . Budding yeast is also advantageous for real - time imaging because the cells are spherical , and individual CME events can be followed from inception at the cortex to internalization into the cytoplasm by imaging from the side using a medial focal plane . Because most CME components are conserved from yeast to humans , principles learned in yeast are expected to apply broadly . For example , Sla2 is a key protein in yeast CME that links the actin cytoskeleton to the coat machinery . In sla2 Δ cells , branched actin polymerization is decoupled from the endocytic machinery , resulting in an accumulation of filamentous actin ( F - actin ) ‘ tails ’ comprising branched filaments that polymerize at the cortex and flux into the cytoplasm ( Kaksonen et al . , 2003 ) . When the human homolog , Hip1R , is knocked down , cells are defective to a similar extent in endocytosis and accumulate cortical actin structures ( Engqvist - Goldstein et al . , 2004 ) . Fluorescent imaging of CME in mammalian cells has shown that endocytic site dynamics are similar to those of yeast CME ( Taylor et al . , 2011 ) . The advent of genome - editing tools now allows for expression of fluorescently tagged proteins at the endogenous level , similar to what has been done in yeast , and has been used to further show that the process is , overall , very similar in both organisms ( Doyon et al . , 2011 ; Hong et al . , 2015 ) . Although CME has also been well studied in other fungi , such as the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe , we chose to focus here on recent highlights from S . cerevisiae for the sake of brevity . In budding yeast , a detailed timeline of the arrival and departure of over 60 proteins at endocytic sites was established in the early - to mid - 2000s ( Merrifield and Kaksonen , 2014 ) . These proteins can be organized into modules according to their functions and the timing of their appearance and disappearance at endocytic sites : ( i ) early proteins ; ( ii ) early , middle and late coat proteins ; ( iii ) WASp ( also known as Las17 in yeast ) and myosin - related proteins , ( iv ) actin and actin - associated proteins ; and ( v ) scission - related proteins ( see poster ) . Although much effort has been put into understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of these modules with high precision , here we review recent studies that have focused on understanding , at a molecular level , what kinds of protein and lipid modification regulate the progression of events at an individual CME site . We specifically focus on protein phosphorylation and ubiquitylation , as well as lipid modifications and protein interactions with lipids . Finally , we highlight new and emerging studies that bridge cargo regulation to internalization . Phosphoregulation Almost all endocytic proteins across all of these modules are phosphorylated ( see poster ) . Several kinases and their substrates have been identified at endocytic sites . In addition , there are kinases that have not been found at endocytic sites , but whose activities have effects on endocytosis . A member of the conserved casein kinase family , Hrr25 , most closely related to the human CK1 δ and CK1 ε isoforms ( Petronczki et al . , 2006 ) , has recently been identified as a member of the early protein module and found to phosphorylate many CME components ( Peng et al . , 2015a ) . Interestingly , Hrr25 is also involved in many other cellular processes , including autophagy ( Tanaka et al . , 2014 ) , trafficking through the Golgi ( Lord et al . , 2011 ) , DNA damage repair ( Hoekstra et al . , 1991 ) and mitotic spindle function ( Peng et al . , 2015b ; Petronczki et al . , 2006 ) . Whether Hrr25 coordinates any of these activities with CME needs to be determined . Several endocytic proteins are also known to be phosphorylated by members of the Ark kinase family , which , in mammalian cells , includes GAK and AAK1 , and in yeast , includes Ark1 , Prk1 and Akl1 ( reviewed in Smythe and Ayscough , 2003 ) . Ark1 and Prk1 ( see the ‘ actin ’ module on the poster ) have well - described roles in controlling actin dynamics at endocytic sites through phosphorylation of Pan1 and End3 ( Cope et al . , 1999 ; Toshima et al . , 2005 ; Zeng and Cai , 1999 ; Zeng et al . , 2001 ) , and in disassembling coat proteins after the CCV internalization ( Sekiya - Kawasaki et al . , 2003 ; Toret et al . , 2008 ) . Many endocytic proteins are also substrates of kinases that have yet to be detected at endocytic sites . Several , such as Abp1 , Sla1 and Sla2 , are substrates of Cdk1 , the master cell cycle regulator ( Holt et al . , 2009 ) . The yeast amphiphysin homolog , Rvs167 , is phosphorylated by the cyclin - dependent kinase Pho85 and the mitogen - activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) Fus3 ( Friesen et al . , 2003 ; Lee et al . , 1998 ) . Phosphorylation of Rvs167 by Pcl2 – Pho85 in vitro disrupts a physical interaction with Las17 / WASp ( Friesen et al . , 2003 ) . The type - I myosin Myo5 is regulated by Cka2 , which is the catalytic subunit of the casein kinase 2 holoenzyme [ CK2 ; see the section on lipid requirements and interactions below for more details ( Fernández - Golbano et al . , 2014 ) ] . The yeast AGC kinaseYpk1 and its upstream kinase Pkh1 , functional homologs of SGK1 and its upstream kinase 3 - phosphoinositide - dependent kinase 1 ( PDPK1 ) , respectively ( Casamayor et al . , 1999 ) , are also required for receptor - mediated and fluid - phase endocytosis ; they are of particular interest because they are also involved in sphingolipid signaling ( Friant et al . , 2001 ; deHart et al . , 2002 ; see below ) . Future studies of these kinase - substrate relationships will determine if and how CME responds to other cellular events . To fully understandhow phosphoregulationfunctions in CME , it is also necessary to understand de - phosphorylation . Scd5 , a subunit that targets protein phosphatase 1 ( PP1 , Glc7 in yeast ) ( see poster ) , counteracts phosphorylation by Ark1 and Prk1 ( Chang et al . , 2002 ; Chi et al . , 2012 ; Henry et al . , 2003 ; Zeng and Cai , 1999 ; Zeng et al . , 2007 ) . In scd5 mutants that fail to interact with PP1 / Glc7 , many endocytic adapter proteins in the coat module are hyperphosphorylated ( Chi et al . , 2012 ; Zeng et al . , 2007 ) . In addition , lack of Scd5 activity causes a delay in the transition from mid to late coat protein progression , which is likely to be due to inefficient recruitment of hyperphosphorylated Sla1 ( Chi et al . , 2012 ) . Ubiquitylation Ubiquitylation of the cytosolic domains of cargo regulates CME internalization in both yeast and mammals ( Haglund and Dikic , 1532 CELL SCIENCE AT A GLANCE Journal of Cell Science ( 2016 ) 129 , 1531 - 1536 doi : 10 . 1242 / jcs . 182303 J o u r n a l o f C e ll S c i e n c e 2012 ; Traub and Lukacs , 2007 ) . A long - standing goal is to determine how cargo affects the progression of endocytic site maturation . Ubiquitin is likely to play a role in linking cargo to the CME machinery . Three of the known yeast endocytic proteins are known to have mono - ubiquitin - interacting domains – a ubiquitin - associated ( UBA ) domain in Ede1 , and a ubiquitin - interacting motif ( UIM ) in both Ent1 and Ent2 ( see poster ) . These proteins regulate the ligand - induced internalization of the α - factor pheromone receptor Ste2 , which is regulated both by casein kinase Yck2 - mediated phosphorylation and ubiquitylation by the HECT E3 ubiquitin ligase Rsp5 ( Dunn and Hicke , 2001a , b ; Toshima et al . , 2009 ) . Ent1 and Ede1 are also thought to be recruited to endocytic sites by ubiquitylated cargo ( Aguilar et al . , 2003 ) . Recent studies are also now focusing on a class of regulatory proteins called α - arrestins in the regulation of ubiquitylation and in Rsp5 - dependent cargo internalization , which will inform how cargoes are specifically regulated and selected for internalization ( Becuwe et al . , 2012 ; Prosser et al . , 2015 ) . In addition to conventional ubiquitin - interacting domains , one of the SH3 domains of Sla1 also binds to ubiquitin ( Stamenova et al . , 2007 ) . This is intriguing as SH3 domains typically bind to the core peptide motif PxxP ( where ‘ x ’ represents any amino acid ) , which exists in many endocytic proteins . Interestingly , a PxxP domain that has bound to this particular ubiquitin - binding SH3 domain can be competed off with free ubiquitin ( Stamenova et al . , 2007 ) . This competition is a potential mechanism for regulating protein – protein interactions in space and time . Studies have also begun to focus on a role for ubiquitylation of the endocytic machinery itself . Manyendocytic proteins , including Sla1 and Rvs167 , have been identified as targets of Rsp5 ( Stamenova et al . , 2004 ) . The early protein Ede1 appears to have multiple levels of regulation through interaction of its UBA domain with ubiquitin , as well as by being ubiquitylated itself ( Dores et al . , 2010 ) . In yeast , deletion of the deubiquitylases UBP7 and UBP2 – whose gene products antagonize Rsp5 - mediated ubiquitylation – or expression of an Ede1 – ubiquitin fusion , results in formation of internal punctae , which contain many endocytic proteins and show similar dynamics to bona fide CME sites . This result has been hypothesized to be due to hyper - ubiquitylated Ede1 and misregulated CME - site initiation . Ubp7 has been found to be a component of endocytic sites , and the protein shows similar spatiotemporal temporal dynamics , as well as spatial localization , to other proteins of the ‘ WASp and myosin ’ module . These proteins do not internalize with the late coat and actin proteins before vesicle scission ( see poster ) ( Weinberg and Drubin , 2014 ) . In addition , the ubiquitin regulatory X ( UBX ) - domain - containing protein Ubx3 regulates the rate of Ede1 recruitment to endocytic sites ( see poster ) . This regulationis proposedtobemediated by an interaction between Ubx3 and Cdc48 , an AAA - ATPase ubiquitin - editing complex ( Farrell et al . , 2015 ) . These observations suggest that dynamic ubiquitylation and deubiquitylation are important for regulating the role of Ede1 in CME site initiation and maturation . It will be important to test whether there is a functional relationship between Ede1 ubiquitylation and phosphorylation . Lipid functions and interactions In almost every module , from early site nucleation to vesicle scission , there is at least one lipid - binding protein ( see poster ) . Lipids have very important roles in the endocytic timeline , yet they are more challenging to study than proteins , somewhat hindering elucidation of their functions . The lipid - binding activities of endocytic proteins might be important to mediate membrane bending or to harness actin forces . Turnoverofphosphatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate [ PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ] is required for endocytic function ( Sun and Drubin , 2013 ; Sun et al . , 2007 ) . Overproduction of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 by deleting genes encoding two of the three PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 phosphatases , the synaptojanins Sjl1 and Sjl2 , leads to a delay in the disassembly of the coat and actin , and defects in fluid - phase and receptor - mediated endocytosis , possibly owing to a failure in scission ( Singer - Krüger et al . , 1998 ; Sun et al . , 2007 ) . Sjl2 itself is recruited to endocytic sites by Abp1 ( Stefan et al . , 2005 ) ( see poster ) . Conversely , PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 depletion using a temperature - sensitive mutant of Mss4 , the sole budding yeast phosphatidylinositol - 4 - phosphate - 5 - kinase , results in formation of actin tails ; in this mutant , coat proteins do not internalize , but actin continuously streams inwards from these coat proteins ( Sun and Drubin , 2013 ) . The Epsin N - terminal homology ( ENTH ) and AP180 N - terminal homology ( ANTH ) domains both bind to PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , and are present in the coat proteins Ent1 and Ent2 ( intermediate coat ) , Yap1801 and Yap1802 ( early coat ) , and Sla2 ( intermediate coat ) ( Aguilar et al . , 2003 ; Carroll et al . , 2012 ; Ford et al . , 2001 ; Itoh et al . , 2001 ; Sun et al . , 2004 ) . The ENTH and ANTH domains of Ent1 and Sla2 co - assemble in a PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - dependentmannerand have been proposed to be responsible for tethering the endocytic machinery to the plasma membrane during membrane tubulation ( Skruzny et al . , 2012 , 2015 ) . Whether and how lipids play a role in site initiation is still an open question . A clue comes from cells in which RCY1 , whose gene product is involved in endosome - to - Golgi trafficking , is deleted . In rcy1 Δ cells , phosphatidylserine , but not PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , accumulates on abnormal internal membrane compartments . Endocytic proteins accumulate on these compartments before the proteins dissociate in the same temporal manner as observed on the plasma membrane , indicating a possible role for phosphatidylserine , specifically , in CME site initiation ( Sun and Drubin , 2013 ) . Interestingly , phosphatidylserine is required for cell polarity and is itself localized in a polarized manner , being enriched on the daughter cell following cell division ( Fairn et al . , 2011 ) . The daughter cell has been observed to have more endocytic sites than the mother , indicating that phosphatidylserine could have a role in site initiation ( Bi and Park , 2012 ) . When components in the phosphatidylserine biosynthetic pathway are mutated , endocytic sites lose their polarized localization ( Sun and Drubin , 2013 ) . However , a phosphatidylserine - binding protein specifically located at CME sites has yet to be identified . The endocytic role for sphingolipids , including sphingoid bases and ceramides , has been elusive . An lcb1 mutant , which is deficient in sphingoid base synthesis , the first step in the synthesis of more complex sphingolipids , shows a substantial defect in internalization of α - factor pheromone , the classic yeast CME cargo ( Munn and Riezman , 1994 ; Zanolari et al . , 2000 ) . Further studies are needed to understand the mechanistic basis for this phenotype . Many lipid - binding proteins , and specifically proteins that either sense or generate curvature , are involved in the final scission process . The yeast amphiphysin homolog , a heterodimeric complex of Rvs161 and Rvs167 , is concentrated along the neck of the growing tubule of a deeply invaginated CCP ( Idrissi et al . , 2008 ; Kaksonen et al . , 2005 ; Picco et al . , 2015 ) . Bzz1 , an F - BAR protein of the WASp and myosin module , and Rvs161 – Rvs167 have been found to contribute cooperatively to vesicle scission ( Kishimoto et al . , 2011 ) . Absence of Rvs161 – Rvs167 results in a ‘ yo - yo ’ phenotype , wherein coat and cargo components internalize from the cortex but then retract back to and disassemble at the cortex instead of entering the cell . This phenotype is exacerbated by loss of Bzz1 . The lack of Rvs161 – Rvs167 and Bzz1 results in an improper 1533 CELL SCIENCE AT A GLANCE Journal of Cell Science ( 2016 ) 129 , 1531 - 1536 doi : 10 . 1242 / jcs . 182303 J o u r n a l o f C e ll S c i e n c e geometry of invagination ( Kishimoto et al . , 2011 ) . Similarly , deletion of VPS1 , whose gene product is a dynamin - like protein , results in ‘ yo - yo ’ phenotypes and misshaped invaginations ( Smaczynska - de Rooij et al . , 2010 ) , consistent with a role in regulating membrane shape and scission , potentially through an F - actin - bundling activity ( Palmer et al . , 2015 ) . Unlike the conventional dynamins involved in mammalian CME , and similar to other dynamin - like proteins , Vps1 does not contain a pleckstrin - homology ( PH ) domain . However , it can still bind to and tubulate liposomes ( Smaczynska - de Rooij et al . , 2010 ) . Although Vps1 does not appear to play as central of a role in scission as dynamin does in mammalian cells , it , along with several other lipid - binding proteins , such as Bzz1 and the Rvs161 – Rvs167 complex , might coordinate membrane remodeling and vesicle scission . Many studies have focused on how the forces and geometries needed to generate membrane scission can be generated by actin and the late - arriving scission proteins ( Kaksonen et al . , 2003 , 2005 ; Picco et al . , 2015 ; and reviewed in Goode et al . , 2015 ; Idrissi and Geli , 2014 ) . Nevertheless , whether the membrane bends before or after actin arrives is still debated ( see poster ; Idrissi et al . , 2012 ; Kukulski et al . , 2012 ) . Therefore , determining the geometry of the endocytic membrane and actin network at each stage is an important goal . In yeast , the two type - I myosins Myo3 and Myo5 have essential lipid - binding and motor activities ( Lewellyn et al . , 2015 ) . Fluorescence microscopy analyses have revealed that these myosins are restricted to the base of growing pits ( Jonsdottir and Li , 2004 ; Picco et al . , 2015 ) . However , immunogold labeling and electron microscopy analyses have demonstrated that the myosins , as well as Las17 / WASp , can also be found at the tip of invaginating pits ( Idrissi et al . , 2012 ) . Accurate localization of these proteins is particularly important for understanding how the geometry and orientation of actin polymerization and myosin lipid - binding activities contribute to the forces that are required for membrane bending during invagination . For example , spatially regulated phosphorylation and repression of Myo5 - mediated actin polymerization by Cka2 is proposed to concentrate branched actin polymerization specifically at the base of endocytic sites ( Fernández - Golbano et al . , 2014 ) . Interestingly , Syp1 , an early - arriving protein , is an F - BAR protein that can interact with actin and negatively regulate actin polymerization induced by the much later arriving protein Las17 / WASp in vitro ( Boettner et al . , 2009 ) ( see poster ) . How this interaction functions in vivo remains an open question . Tying everything together The assembly and disassembly dynamics of many CME proteins at endocytic sites have been determined ; however , understanding how spatiotemporal regulation is achieved is necessary for understanding the underlying mechanisms for this well - conserved process . Based on the intriguing observation that early - arriving proteins have highly variable lifetimes compared to the very regular timing of later - arriving proteins ( late coat and beyond ) , CME can be broadly simplified into two temporal phases – an ‘ early phase ’ and a ‘ late phase ’ . Recent studies have begun to investigate the molecular basis for these two phases and their timing . For example , by eliminating certain early - phase proteins , it has been shown that they are not required for the recruitment of the late - phase machinery and vesicle budding , but instead control the spatial location of endocytic site assembly ( Brach et al . , 2014 ) . Expression of the key early - phase protein Ede1 at sites typically devoid of CME results in the recruitment of downstream late - phase proteins ( Brach et al . , 2014 ) . In addition , higher - order assembly of most of the late - phase proteins can be reconstituted in vitro by incubating microspheres that have been coated with late - phase Las17 / WASp in yeast extracts . In these experiments , Las17 / WASp - coated microspheres nucleated actin filaments and recruited most of the late - phase proteins , but interestingly , very few of the early - phase proteins ( Michelot et al . , 2010 ) , supporting the conclusion that the early phase is separable from the late phase . Because cargo molecules arrive after the early and early coat proteins , but before the late coat proteins ( Toshima et al . , 2006 ) , it has been proposed that the transition from irregular to the regular lifetimes of later - arriving proteins might be controlled through a cargo checkpoint ( Carroll et al . , 2012 ) , as has been proposed in mammalian cells ( Loerke et al . , 2009 ) . This model is supported by data that show that the early - phase protein Ede1 has a much shorter lifetime in the bud of cells undergoing polarized growth , where it is thought that polarized secretion increases the amount of cargo in the bud , compared to that of the mother ( Layton et al . , 2011 ) . Key findings involving the late coat proteins Pan1 , End3 and Sla1 have defined a site - initiation phase and an actin - polymerization phase ( Sun et al . , 2015 ) . A pan1 - null strain is inviable , but with the use of the auxin - inducible degron system , which acutely depletes proteins through proteasome - mediated degradation ( Eng et al . , 2014 ; Nishimura et al . , 2009 ) , Pan1 has been found to be required for the transition between early CME events and actin assembly ( Bradford et al . , 2015 ) . Interestingly , when Pan1 and its interaction partner End3 are simultaneously depleted , the ‘ early module ’ and ‘ early – mid coat module ’ proteins are capable of colocalizing at the cell cortex ; however , the WASp and myosin , scission and actin modules remain spatiotemporally uncoupled from these coat proteins ( Sun et al . , 2015 ) . At the interface between these two functional phases , the cargo adapter Sla1 is recruited , which associates with Pan1 and End3 . Although Sla1 is not the only CME cargo adapter , it is intriguing that it appears at the junction of these two phases , suggesting a possible role in coordinating cargo recruitment with actin assembly and vesicle formation . However , future studies are required to elucidate the mechanisms and functions underlying the coordination of these two phases . Conclusions and perspectives CME is a very regular and resilient process that has a very stereotypical assembly and disassembly timeline . Much work has been put into elucidating the timing and functions of the individual proteins , which we have now detailed in the accompanying timeline ( see poster ) . However , to understand how CME functions and why it is so regular and predictable requires a deeper understanding of how the endocytic machinery is regulated and how each component interacts with the others . How is each step ( site initiation , cargo capture , coat assembly , membrane bending , invagination , scission , etc . ) regulated ? What are the minimal components or key activities for each step ? What are the biophysical properties of protein – protein or protein – lipid interactions , and how do they change as the site matures ? Answering these questions will provide a basis for understanding how CME progresses . The findings are expected to apply to other organisms .
