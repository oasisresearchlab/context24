In vivo Prk1p inhibition blocked phero - mone receptor endocytosis , and caused cortical actin patches to rapidly aggregate into large clumps that contained Abp1p , Sla2p , Pan1p , Sla1p , and Ent1p . Clump formation depended on Arp2p , suggesting that this phenotype might result from unregulated Arp2 / 3 - stimulated actin assembly . Electron microscopy / immunoelectron microscopy analysis W and tracking of the endocytic membrane marker FM4 - 64 revealed vesicles of likely endocytic origin within the actin clumps . Upon inhibitor washout , the actin clumps rapidly disassembled , and properly polarized actin patches re - appeared . Our results suggest that actin clumps result from blockage at a normally transient step during which actin assembly is stimulated by endocytic proteins . Thus , we revealed tight phosphoregulation of an intrinsically dynamic , actin patch – related process , and propose that Prk1p neg - atively regulates the actin assembly – stimulating activity of endocytic proteins . Introduction Control of actin dynamics by associated proteins plays a crucial role in many biological processes including endocy - tosis , exocytosis , organelle inheritance , cell motility , and cell morphogenesis . F - actin in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is mainly found in three distinct structures : cables , the contractile ring , and cortical patches ( Pruyne and Bretscher , 2000 ) . Actin patches can be highly motile ( 0 . 06 – 1 (cid:2) m / s ) and undergo active turnover ( for review see Engqvist - Goldstein and Drubin , 2003 ) . They are also functionally linked to endocytosis , as many actin patch components are essential for this process , and drugs that perturb actin turnover inhibit endocytosis ( for review see Engqvist - Goldstein and Drubin , 2003 ) . Consistent with these observations , transient association between the actin cytoskeleton and endocytic sites has recently been shown to be a characteristic of caveolae - and clathrin - mediated endocytosis in mammalian cells ( for review see Engqvist - Goldstein and Drubin , 2003 ) . However , the molec - ular mechanisms underlying actin’s involvement in endocytosis remain poorly understood . Yeast actin - regulating kinase ( Ark ) 1p and Prk1p , a redun - dant pair of Ark family kinases , are strong candidates to directly couple the dynamic processes of actin cytoskeleton assembly and endocytosis ( for review see Smythe and Ayscough , 2003 ) . The three known in vivo targets of Prk1p , Pan1p ( Eps15 - related Arp2 / 3 activator ; Zeng and Cai , 1999 ; Duncan et al . , 2001 ) , Ent1p ( epsin - related protein ; Watson et al . , 2001 ) , and Sla1p ( an adaptor for Ste2p receptor endocytosis ; Zeng and Cai , 1999 ; Howard et al . , 2002 ) , are actin patch proteins . Each of these Prk1p targets plays an important role in both endocytosis and in actin cytoskeleton regulation The online version of this article includes supplemental material .

Both elevation and loss of Ark kinase activity lead to defective ac - tin cytoskeleton organization and endocytosis ( Cope et al . , 1999 ; Zeng and Cai , 1999 ; Watson et al . , 2001 ; Zeng et al . , 2001 ) , suggesting that the regulation by protein phosphory - lation is crucial for both systems . A mammalian Ark family kinase , AAK1 , localizes to sites of clathrin - mediated endocy - tosis , and phosphorylation by AAK1 negatively regulates en - docytosis ( Conner and Schmid , 2002 ) . To gain insights into the regulatory mechanisms of actin cytoskeleton assembly and endocytosis by Prk1p , we used a chemical genetics approach ( Bishop et al . , 2001 ) that en - abled us to rapidly modulate Prk1p activity in vivo . In com - parison to the conventional approach using kinase - dead mu - tants , this approach enabled us to investigate the direct and immediate consequence of Prk1p inactivation for the regula - tion of actin assembly and endocytosis . Results and discussion Construction of prk1 - analogue - sensitive ( prk1 - as ) mutants that rapidly respond to 1NA - PP1 To determine how Prk1p functions in actin organization and endocytosis in living cells , we created analogue - sensitive mutants ( Bishop et al . , 2001 ) of Prk1p in cells that lack Ark1p . Inactivation of both kinases was necessary because ei - ther one alone is sufficient to carry out the functions related to actin organization ( Cope et al . , 1999 ) and endocytosis ( unpublished data ) . We constructed ark1 (cid:4) prk1 - as1 ( with a M108G mutation ) and ark1 (cid:4) prk1 - as3 ( with M108G and C175A mutations ) strains , in which substitutions of bulky amino acids in the ATP - binding pocket of Prk1p were made to render the kinase sensitive to a PP1 analogue , 4 - amino - 1 - tert - butyl - 3 - ( 1 (cid:3) - naphthyl ) pyrazolo [ 3 , 4 - d ] pyrimidine ( 1NA - PP1 ; Bishop et al . , 1998 ) . In the absence of 1NA - PP1 , both ark1 (cid:4) prk1 - as1 and ark1 (cid:4) prk1 - as3 mutants had growth rates and actin morphologies indistinguishable from the wild - type parent strain , and showed normal growth at 37 (cid:5) C . ark1 (cid:4) prk1 - as1 and ark1 (cid:4) prk1 - as3 cells showed specific sensitivity to 1NA - PP1 . Upon treatment of these mutants with 1NA - PP1 , unpolarized actin and actin clumps were ob - served in a dose - dependent manner ( Fig . 1 , A and B ) , indi - cating that inhibitor treatment mimics the phenotype seen upon loss of Ark1p and Prk1p ( Cope et al . , 1999 ) . Actin ca - bles appeared to be unaffected by inhibitor addition ( Fig . 1 A ; (cid:6) 1NA - PP1 ) . As assessed by quantifying the percentage of cells forming actin clumps , the effect of 1NA - PP1 was saturated at 80 (cid:2) M for ark1 (cid:4) prk1 - as1 , and at 40 (cid:2) M for ark1 (cid:4) prk1 - as3 ( Fig . 1 B ) . As a further indication that ark1 (cid:4) prk1 - as3 cells are more sensitive to the inhibitor , at optimal inhibitor doses , 40 (cid:2) M for ark1 (cid:4) prk1 - as3 and 80 (cid:2) M for ark1 (cid:4) prk1 - as1 , (cid:2) 95 % of ark1 (cid:4) prk1 - as3 cells formed actin clumps , whereas (cid:2) 80 % of ark1 (cid:4) prk1 - as1 cells formed clumps ( Fig . 1 B ) . The actin cytoskeleton of ark1 (cid:4) PRK1 cells was not affected by 40 – 120 (cid:2) M 1NA - PP1 ( un - published data ) . Next , we analyzed the in vivo phosphorylation of Ent1p , a target of Prk1p that shows a Prk1p - dependent mobility shift ( Watson et al . , 2001 ) . Both ark1 (cid:4) prk1 - as1 and ark1 (cid:4) prk1 - as3 cells display wild - type Ent1p phosphorylation levels in the absence of 1NA - PP1 ( Fig . 1 C ) . Addition of inhibitor for 30 min resulted in a dose - dependent inhibition of Ent1p phosphorylation in ark1 (cid:4) prk1 - as1 cells ( Fig . 1 D , bottom ) . With 80 (cid:2) M inhibitor , Ent1p phosphorylation was severely inhibited by 5 min , and appeared completely inhibited by 15 min ( Fig . 1 E ) . Ent1p phosphorylation in ark1 (cid:4) PRK1 cells was not affected by 40 – 120 (cid:2) M 1NA - PP1 ( Fig . 1 D , top ) . Thus , 1NA - PP1 specifically and rapidly inhibits Prk1p - as kinase activity . Next , we evaluated actin organiza - tion as a function of time after Prk1p inhibition ( Fig . 1 F ) . By 2 min , (cid:2) 60 % of the ark1 (cid:4) prk1 - as3 cells had lost actin patch polarization and / or had actin clumps . By 20 min , the percentage of the cells with actin clumps reached saturation ( (cid:2) 80 % for ark1 (cid:4) prk1 - as1 , unpublished data ; (cid:2) 95 % for ark1 (cid:4) prk1 - as3 , Fig . 1 F ) . Interestingly , at 2 min , the major - ity of the actin clumps in ark1 (cid:4) prk1 - as1 and ark1 (cid:4) prk1 - as3 cells were found in the daughter cell . At 5 min , actin clumps were mainly seen in the mother cell . The Prk1p target Pan1p is an activator of the Arp2 / 3 complex . By introducing the temperature - sensitive arp2 - 1 mutant of an Arp2 / 3 complex subunit into the ark1 (cid:4) prk1 - as3 background , we tested whether Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin assembly is required for clump formation . The arp2 - 1 mu - tant shows significant endocytic defects at the permissive temperature , although it displays normal actin organization ( Moreau et al . , 1997 ) . The ark1 (cid:4) prk1 - as3 arp2 - 1 cells formed actin clumps much less efficiently ( (cid:2) 5 % , n (cid:7) 100 ) than ark1 (cid:4) prk1 - as3 cells ( (cid:2) 95 – 100 % , n (cid:7) 100 ) at 25 (cid:5) C ( Fig . 1 G ) . The actin clumps disappeared rapidly in re - sponse to the actin monomer sequestering drug latrunculin - A ( Ayscough et al . , 1997 ; unpublished data ) , suggesting that actin turnover is not severely affected by Prk1p inhibi - tion . In total , these data support the possibility that actin clumps are the result of unregulated Arp2 / 3 - stimulated ac - tin assembly . Real - time analysis of actin patch dynamics upon Prk1p inhibition To investigate actin patch dynamics as a function of Prk1p inhibition , we performed real - time analyses of ark1 (cid:4) prk1 - as1 cells expressing Abp1 - GFP ( Fig . 2 ) . Similar results were obtained with ark1 (cid:4) prk1 - as3 cells ( unpublished data ) . Abp1p is a component of cortical actin patches ( Drubin et al . , 1988 ) . Within 1 to 2 min of 1NA - PP1 addition to ark1 (cid:4) prk1 - as1 cells , Abp1 - GFP patches aggregated into clumps ( Fig . 2 A and Video 1 , available at http : / / www . jcb . org / cgi / content / full / jcb . 200305077 / DC1 ) . Once formed in the daughter cell , the actin clumps invariably moved toward the bud neck , and then into the mother cell ( Fig . 2 B ) , consistent with the observation for fixed cells ( Fig . 1 F ) , which exhibited an increase of mother clumps and a decrease of daughter clumps during the time course . The mechanistic basis for this movement is unknown , but does not seem to involve microtubules because the process was not sensitive to the microtubule - depolymerizing drug nocodazole ( unpublished data ) . Within 1 min of Prk1p re - activation by inhibitor washout , the clumps disassembled , and the normal polarized distribution of Abp1 patches was on A p r il 15 , 2005 www . j c b . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m Th e J ou r n a l o f C e ll B i o l o gy Chemical genetics of Prk1p | Sekiya - Kawasaki et al . 767 Figure 1 .

Rhodamine - phalloidin staining of fixed ark1 (cid:4) prk1 - as1 cells confirmed that F - actin undergoes reversible aggregation upon 1NA - PP1 addition ( unpublished data ) . The endocytic proteins Sla2p , Pan1p , Sla1p , and Ent1p , which localize at actin patches in wild - type cells , were pre - viously shown to be present in the large actin clumps in ark1 (cid:4) prk1 (cid:4) cells ( Cope et al . , 1999 ; Watson et al . , 2001 ; Warren et al . , 2002 ) . We found that all of these proteins are also present in the inhibitor - induced clumps ( Fig . 2 D for Sla2p ; unpublished data for Pan1p , Sla1p , and Ent1p ) . The rapid and reversible actin clump formation described in Figs . 1 and 2 revealed that the wild - type actin patches are under tight regulation by protein phosphory - lation . Several lines of evidence support the conclusion that actin clump formation is a direct consequence of inhibiting phosphorylation of actin patch components . First , all known in vivo targets ( Pan1p , Sla1p , and Ent1p ) of Prk1p are actin patch proteins . Second , Prk1p kinase is exclusively localized in cortical actin patches ( Cope et al . , 1999 ; Zeng and Cai , 1999 ) . Third , actin clumps form rapidly upon addition of 1NA - PP1 , and disappear rapidly when it is removed . Receptor - mediated endocytic internalization is blocked upon Prk1p inhibition Further , we tested whether Prk1p kinase activity is required for (cid:9) - factor internalization by its receptor , Ste2p . Because of its high sensitivity to 1NA - PP1 , all subsequent analyses used the prk1 - as3 allele . Without inhibitor , ark1 (cid:4) prk1 - as3 cells show internalization kinetics indistinguishable from ark1 (cid:4) PRK1 ( Fig . 3 A ) . Treatment of ark1 (cid:4) prk1 - as3 cells with 1NA - PP1 for 30 min specifically inhibited receptor internal - ization ( Fig . 3 B ) . Even 120 (cid:2) M inhibitor did not affect (cid:9) - factor internalization by ark1 (cid:4) PRK1 cells ( Fig . 3 B ) . Additionally , a kinase - dead mutant ( ark1 (cid:4) prk1 D159A ) also showed a severe block of receptor internalization ( Fig . 3 C ) . Thus , the inhibition of Prk1p kinase activity profoundly blocks the internalization step of receptor - mediated endocy - tosis . Association of endocytic membranes with actin upon Prk1p inhibition Next , we investigated the fate of the endocytic membrane marker FM4 - 64 ( Vida and Emr , 1995 ) in inhibitor - treated ark1 (cid:4) prk1 - as3 cells ( Fig . 4 ) . FM4 - 64 was first incorporated Figure 2 . Reversible actin clump formation from cortical actin patches upon inhibition of Prk1p activity .

In mock - treated ark1 (cid:4) prk1 - as3 or wild - type cells , this dye is later found in endosomes ( Fig . 4 A , top , 5 min ) and finally accu - mulates in vacuoles ( Vida and Emr , 1995 ; unpublished data ) . In mock - treated cells , the endosomes seen at 5 min do not show significant colocalization with Abp1p ( Fig . 4 A , top ) . Next , we treated ark1 (cid:4) prk1 - as3 cells simultaneously with FM4 - 64 and 1NA - PP1 . At 5 min , we found that FM4 - 64 staining colocalized with actin clumps ( Fig . 4 A , bot - tom ) . The FM4 - 64 dye in actin clumps was later trans - ported to vacuoles ( after 15 – 20 min ) , although the kinetics were delayed compared with the wild type ( 10 min ; unpub - lished data ) . These observations suggest that the block of Prk1p activity leads to accumulation of an endocytic com - partment that associates with actin . Next , we examined ark1 (cid:4) prk1 (cid:4) ( Fig . 4 , C – H and K – N ) and inhibitor - treated ark1 (cid:4) prk1 - as3 cells ( Fig . 4 , I and J for cells treated for 10 min ; also see Fig . S1 ) by conventional EM . To better visualize actin filaments , we first observed cells post - treated with tannic acid ( Fig . 4 , B – J ) . Compared with wild - type cells that showed no remarkable morphology ( Fig . 4 B ) , both ark1 (cid:4) prk1 (cid:4) and inhibitor - treated ark1 (cid:4) prk1 - as3 cells showed clustered vesicles of (cid:2) 100 nm ( ar - rows ) in the area where microfilaments ( arrowheads ) are ob - served ( Fig . 4 , C – J , dashed area ; also see Fig . S1 ) . Next , we observed ark1 (cid:4) prk1 (cid:4) cells processed by high pressure freez - ing followed by freeze substitution , and also detected accu - mulation of (cid:2) 100 - nm vesicles ( Fig . 4 , K – N , arrows ) . With this procedure , the vesicles are seen within areas that exclude ribosomes ( Fig . 4 K , dashed area ) , and they sometimes ap - pear to have electron - dense coats ( Fig . 4 M , left arrow ; Fig . 4 N , arrow ) . The colocalization of vesicles with microfila - ments and ribosome exclusion areas suggested that the vesi - cles might reside within actin clumps . Therefore , we used immuno - EM to determine if this was indeed the case ( Fig . 4 , O – R ) . In indirect immunolabeling for actin on ultrathin cryosections of fixed ark1 (cid:4) prk1 (cid:4) cells , 10 - nm gold parti - cles were seen to localize to slightly electron - dense areas ( Fig . 4 O , dashed area ) . These immunogold - labeled actin clumps were seen to contain (cid:2) 100 - nm vesicles similar to those seen using conventional EM ( Fig . 4 , O – Q , dashed boxes ) . Thus , we conclude that the block of the Ark kinases leads to the ac - cumulation of actin and actin - associated vesicles . Addition - ally , in double - immunogold labeling for Sla1 - GFP ( 5 - nm gold ) and actin ( 10 - nm gold ) , Sla1 - containing vesicles were occasionally detected within the actin clumps ( Fig . 4 R ) . In this work , we examined the rapid and acute effects of Prk1p kinase inhibition and reactivation by applying a chemical genetics approach . We showed that abnormal actin clumps formed and disappeared within 1 to 2 min of Prk1p inhibition and reactivation , respectively . Further , we showed that the actin clumps contain endocytic proteins and (cid:2) 100 - nm vesicles . We propose that Prk1p directly regulates the coupling between actin assembly and endocytosis by pro - moting disassembly and / or inactivation of an early endocytic complex that stimulates actin assembly ( Fig . 5 A ) . When Prk1p is inhibited , this complex is stabilized , and actin as - sembly continues to be stimulated by endocytic proteins such as the Prk1p target Pan1p and the associated Arp2 / 3 complex ( Zeng and Cai , 1999 ; Duncan et al . , 2001 ) , and / or other targets including Sla1p and Ent1p ( Watson et al . , 2001 ; Zeng et al . , 2001 ; Fig . 5 B ) . In mammalian cells , the (cid:2) 2 subunit of AP2 is phosphorylated by AAK1 at Thr - 156 ( ITSQVT 156 G ) ( Ricotta et al . , 2002 ) . However , the bud - ding yeast AP2 homologue , Apm4p ( Huang et al . , 1999 ) , is not important for receptor internalization and does not con - tain potential Prk1p - phosphorylation motifs similar to ( L / IxxQxTG ) . Rather , our genetic experiment showing that Arp2p is required for clump formation supports the idea that Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin assembly is negatively regulated by Prk1p , potentially via phosphorylation of the Arp2 / 3 ac - Figure 3 .

Our data also support the proposal that actin participates directly in yeast endocytosis . Materials and methods Media , growth conditions , and materials Yeast strains were grown in standard rich media ( YPD ) or synthetic media ( SD ) supplemented with the appropriate amino acids . 1NA - PP1was syn - thesized and handled as described previously ( Bishop et al . , 1998 ) . ark1 (cid:4) prk1 - as1 cells were treated with 80 (cid:2) M inhibitor and ark1 (cid:4) prk1 - as3 cells with 40 (cid:2) M inhibitor in SD - based media unless indicated otherwise . All the yeast strains were cultured at 25 (cid:5) C , except for DDY904 and ark1 (cid:4) prk1 (cid:4) , which were cultured at 30 (cid:5) C . Strains and plasmids The yeast strains are listed in Table I . prk1 (cid:4) : : PRK1 : : URA3 and prk1 (cid:4) : : prk1 : : URA3 integration plasmids were created as follows : First , a NotI site on A p r il 15 , 2005 www . j c b . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m Th e J ou r n a l o f C e ll B i o l o gy Chemical genetics of Prk1p | Sekiya - Kawasaki et al . 771 Fluorescent microscopy F - actin was stained as described previously ( Cope et al . , 1999 ) . FM4 - 64 was used at a concentration of 8 (cid:2) M in SD - based media . For live imaging , cells were attached to 50 (cid:2) g / ml concanavalin A – coated long coverslips ( 24 (cid:10) 50 mm ) . A flow chamber was made by mounting a small coverslip ( 18 (cid:10) 18 mm ) on top of the long coverslip with grease and small pieces of coverslips as spacers . Two sides were left unsealed so that media could be exchanged . Cells were viewed using a microscope ( model TE300 ; Nikon ) equipped with a 100 (cid:10) objective , NA 1 . 4 , and a cooled CCD camera ( Hamamatsu ) . Phase - 3 software ( Phase - 3 Imaging Systems ) was used for vi - sualization of rhodamine , GFP , and FM4 - 64 . In a CFP – YFP colocalization study , cells were photographed by rapidly alternating excitation / emission filters ( JP4 filter sets ; Chroma Technology Corp . ) . Filter wheels ( Lambda 10 – 2 ; Sutter Instrument Co . ) were mounted on the excitation and emission ports of the microscope and were controlled with MetaMorph ® software ( Universal Imaging Corp . ) . Electron microscopy Morphological observations of cells by conventional EM was performed essentially as described previously ( Rieder et al . , 1996 ) , except that after fixation with FeCNOsO 4 / thiocarbohydrazide / FeCNOsO 4 ( OTO ) , the cells were further treated with 1 % tannic acid for 30 min . Morphological obser - vations of cells fixed by high pressure freezing and freeze substitution were performed as described in McDonald and Müller - Reichert ( 2002 ) . Im - muno - EM was performed as described previously ( Rieder et al . , 1996 ) . Pri - mary antibodies used were affinity - purified rabbit anti - actin antibody ( a gift from A . Bretscher , Cornell University , Ithaca , NY ) and mouse anti - GFP antibody ( StressGen Biotechnologies ) ; secondary 5 - and 10 - nm gold con - jugates were obtained from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories . Protein and immunological techniques To obtain yeast whole - cell lysates , the cells were lysed with glass beads in ice - cold lysis buffer ( 50 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 % NP - 40 , protease inhibitor cocktail , 50 mM NaF , 0 . 2 mM sodium orthovanadate , 25 mM (cid:11) - glycerophosphate , 1 (cid:2) M cyclosporin A , 4and 0 (cid:2) M cantharidin ) . 50 (cid:2) g of the lysate was loaded per lane . For the time - course experiment , 2 - OD cells were harvested and resuspended in 50 (cid:2) l lysis buffer ( 50 mM Tris , pH 6 . 8 , 2 % SDS , 100 mM DTT , 8 % glycerol , 0 . 02 % BPB , protease inhibitor cocktail , 50 mM NaF , 0 . 2 mM sodium orthovanadate , 25 mM (cid:11) - glycerophosphate , and 1 (cid:2) M cyclosporin A ) . The suspension was boiled for 3 min , and then lysed with glass beads for 2 min , followed by 1 min of boiling . 100 (cid:2) l of the SDS - PAGE buffer was finally added to the lysate . 10 Table I .

Figure 5 . Model for Ark - kinase function in endocytosis . ( A ) In wild - type cells , Prk1p promotes proper disassembly of the actin - associated endocytic complex . Phosphatase ( s ) might be responsible for reformation and / or activation of the endocytic complex . Ark1p , a closely related homologue of Prk1p , is likely to perform an over - lapping function . ( B ) When Ark1p and Prk1p are inhibited , vesicles associated with actin filaments and endocytic proteins accumulate .

Anti - Ent1p antibody ( Wat - son et al . , 2001 ) was used at 1 : 10 , 000 dilution for Western blotting . (cid:9) - factor uptake assay 35 S - labeled (cid:9) - factor was prepared as described in Howard et al . ( 2002 ) . The (cid:9) - factor uptake assay was performed at 25 (cid:5) C based on a continuous incubation protocol ( Dulic et al . , 1991 ) with modifications as follows : cells were grown in SD , harvested by centrifugation , and resuspended in inter - nalization media ( SD media with 0 . 5 % casamino acid and 1 % BSA ) . Then the cells were mixed with an equal volume of SD media containing 2 (cid:10) concentration of 1NA - PP1 . After incubation with 1NA - PP1 for 30 min , 30 , 000 cpm / 100 (cid:2) l 35 S - labeled (cid:9) - factor was added at time zero . At the in - dicated time points , aliquots were withdrawn and diluted in ice - cold buffer at pH 6 . 0 ( total (cid:9) - factor ) or pH 1 . 1 ( internalized (cid:9) - factor ) . The sam - ples were then filtered , and radioactivity was measured in a scintillation counter . The results were expressed as the ratio of pH 1 . 1 cpm / pH 6 . 0 cpm for each time point to represent the percentage of internalization .
