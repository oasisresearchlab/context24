Tan , Hock - Hal Teo , Kwok - Kee Wei Department of Information Systems and Computer Science , National University of Singapore , 10 Kent Ridge Crescent , Singapore 0511 , Republic of Singapore Abstract Groups are sometimes convened to make decisions that promote wider acceptance of and greater commitment to the results . To accomplish this objective , groups need to achieve an acceptable consensus level . Group support systems ( GSS ) offer a means of enhancing consensus . In this study , a consensus monitor incorporated in a GSS was used by small decision making groups in an experimental setting . Groups that used the consensus monitor several times achieved higher post - meeting consensus than groups that used the consensus monitor only once . However , these groups did not differ in terms of perceived decision quality and perceived decision process quality . The implications of these findings are discussed . Keywords : Group support systems ; Consensus monitor ; Group decision making ; Group consensus 1 . Introduction Modern societies rely heavily on group deci - sions 13 . Groups possess several advantages over individuals as decision makers . First , groups are more likely than individuals to have a broad and better range of skills and knowledge pertaining to the decision . Second , groups provide the oppor - tunity for an effective division of labour to ac - quire and process the vast amount of information needed for the decision . Third , when groups are composed of members representing a diversity of interests , the decision is perceived to be more representative of the needs of members . This results in wider acceptance of and greater com - mitment to the decision . Although groups offer several potential bene - fits as decision makers , they do not necessarily materialize . Hill 20 reviewed 60 years of empiri - cal research and concluded that groups seldom 0378 - 7206 / 95 / $ 09 . 50 Â© 1995 Elsevier Science B . V .

This suggests that groups may not make optimal use of the complete range of skills and knowledge they possess . This could be the result of conformance pressure 18 or evaluation apprehension 11 . Conformance pressure arises when group mem - bers refrain from contributing ideas against ma - jority thinking because of politeness or fear . Eval - uation apprehension results when group mem - bers withhold novel ideas due to fear of negative evaluation from the group . The ability of groups to process a vast amount of information effectively is contingent upon their ability to cope with information overload 21 . Even when groups are able to handle this prob - lem effectively , there is still the possibility of incomplete use of information 22 . The accep - tance of and commitment to the decision are also dependent upon the consensus level achieved . If group members do not agree with each other and reserved 252 B . C Y . Tan et al . / Information & Management 28 ( 1995 ) 251 - 259 with the decision , it is unlikely that they will accept and be committed to the decision . A group decision reached as a result of conformance pres - sure or domination by a minority is likely to be no better than an individual decision . Group techniques and GSS 10 , 27 have been proposed as means to enhance group effective - ness . GSS combine communication , computer , and decision support technologies to support problem formulation and solution during group decision making . This study examines how a GSS can be used to promote consensus in small deci - sion making groups so as to facilitate wider ac - ceptance of and commitment to the decision . judgement theory 5 , which posits that disagree - ment in decisions between individuals can be partially attributed to the differences in impor - tance placed by them on each piece of informa - tion and the differences in the manner with which they relate information to their final decisions . This technique suggests that group members be provided with feedback on how others arrived at their decisions . The feedback will enable group members to explore the reasons behind their differing decisions and thus resolve their differ - ences . 2 . 2 . GSS 2 . Promoting consensus Preference tasks are widespread in organiza - tions because the preferences of decision makers dominate many important decisions . They are often performed by groups to ensure wider ac - ceptance of the decisions . Groups performing preference tasks are often judged in terms of consensus level , perceived decision quality , and perceived decision process quality 35 . The at - tainment of high consensus level is important . Group members must agree before they can ac - cept and be committed to the decisions . 2 . 1 . Group techniques When applying nominal group technique ( NGT ) , a group goes through a series of rounds to vote on alternatives . In each round , all group members cast their votes . After this , the results are summarized and discussed by the group be - fore the next vote . This process iterates until the group has reached consensus . NGT promotes consensus in two ways . First , by providing all group members with an equal opportunity to vote , it facilitates personal involvement and en - courages contribution . Second , group members discuss the results of each vote before proceeding to the next . This permits group members to re - solve differences gradually and move towards consensus . Social judgement analysis is based on social GSS add an anonymous electronic communi - cation channel . Besides encouraging personal ex - pression , it helps group members who are reti - cent about open communication to contribute their views . This is likely to lead to greater per - sonal involvement , greater individual contribu - tion , and better group consensus . However , this theoretical benefit of GSS has not been consis - tently demonstrated in empirical research . In contrast , several studies have reported negative GSS effects on group consensus 14 , 23 , 34 , 36 . The fuzzy model of consensus 31 provides a means of measuring the consensus level of small decision making groups . It accepts , as inputs , the individual decisions of all group members on all alternatives . It produces an output value indicat - ing the consensus level for the entire group on all alternatives . This output value ranges from 0 ( total disagreement ) to 1 ( total agreement ) . This model can be used to measure group consensus after each vote . A consensus monitor based on this model can be incorporated in a GSS . If the consensus level is not up to expectation , group members can proceed to discuss their differences and repeat the vote . 3 . Hypotheses The research model ( see Fig . 1 ) is based on a conceptual framework for the study of groups 25 . In this study , task characteristics are con - trolled by using the same preference task for all B . C . Y .

The research model . groups . Three aspects of group characteristics are important : group size 9 , group proximity 3 , and pre - meeting consensus . The first two are con - trolled by using five - person , face - to - face groups . Pre - meeting consensus is measured and used as a covariate during data analysis . GSS characteris - tics are controlled by using the same GSS for all groups . The use of consensus monitor is manipu - lated at two levels : single and multiple use . Post - meeting consensus measures the ability of groups to attain consensus during decision mak - ing . Perceived decision quality can be used as a surrogate measure for actual decision quality for preference tasks which do not have objective cor - rect answers 16 . Perceived decision process quality measures the extent to which group mem - bers are satisfied with their decision making method . A consensus monitor is able to highlight issues of disagreement among group members and show the extent of disagreement . Each vote helps group members to focus their attention on contentious issues so that they can try to resolve them . Each use of the consensus monitor is likely to help a decision making group increase its consensus level , though successive increases are likely to come at a diminishing rate . Hypothesis 1 : Post - meeting consensus will be higher in groups that use the consensus monitor several times than in groups that use the consen - sus monitor only once . Since group members are likely to possess differing preferences , it is necessary for them to narrow their differences when performing a pref - erence task . A group decision is reached when the group has achieved an acceptable consensus level or when the group has reached their dead - line . For the former , group members are more likely to feel that their decision is right and the process complete and appropriate . For the latter , group members compromise reluctantly and are more likely to feel bad about their decision and inadequate about the process . Since multiple use of the consensus monitor is likely to increase the consensus level , it is also likely to result in higher perceived decision quality and perceived decision process quality . Hypothesis 2 : Perceived decision quality will be higher in groups that use the consensus monitor several times than in groups that use the consen - sus monitor only once . Hypothesis 3 : Perceived decision process qual - ity will be higher in groups that use the consensus monitor several times than in groups that use the consensus monitor only once . 4 . Methodology A controlled laboratory experiment was con - ducted . Small face - to - face groups were employed because organizational decisions are often made by such groups . A group size of 5 was chosen because this appears to be the optimal size 19 , 33 and average number of participants in organiza - tional meetings 8 . 4 . 1 . The task The task employed was the Personal Trust Foundation task developed by Watson 35 . It required subjects to allocate a fixed sum of money to 6 competing projects , which were based on the 6 basic motives in personality ( theoretical , eco - nomic , aesthetic , social , political , and religious ) described by Spranger 32 . 4 . 2 . The GSS and consensus monitor The GSS used was the Software Aided Group Environment ( SAGE ) system 37 . SAGE is im - 254 B . C . Y .

Structure of SAGE . plemented on HyperCard and runs on a network of Macintosh personal computers ( see Fig . 2 ) . It consists of two major programs : public and pri - vate . The former collected group member inputs and transmitted them to the latter , which aggre - gated , stored , and displayed them on the public screen . The Idea Gathering and Idea Evaluation modules of SAGE permitted group members to express and rate their inputs respectively . The consensus monitor is a decision aid in SAGE . Its inputs were the decisions of all group members , who allocated funds among alterna - tives . Instead of computing an overall consensus level for the group on all alternatives , it used a modified version of the fuzzy model of consensus to produce a consensus level for the group for each alternative ( see Appendix ) . This permitted group members to assess the extent to which they agreed or disagreed on each alternative and fo - cused their attention on contentious issues . Its output could be viewed in both tabular and graphical forms . 4 . 3 . The procedure The experiment involved : ( 1 ) A warm - up task to alleviate problems asso - ciated with groups that have not worked together 4 ; ( 2 ) The actual task , performed separately , to compute pre - meeting consensus ; ( 3 ) Thorough training in the use of SAGE and the consensus monitor to minimize problems aris - ing from misuse ; ( 4 ) The actual task , performed collectively us - ing SAGE and the consensus monitor . Half the groups could use the consensus monitor only once ; the other half could use it several times . There were no restrictions on the number of rounds of discussion and votes for all groups . The time required to reach consensus was recorded ; ( 5 ) The actual task , performed individually again , to compute post - meeting consensus ; ( 6 ) Responses to two instruments that mea - sured perceived decision quality and perceived decision process quality ; and ( 7 ) Completion of a questionnaire eliciting sub - ject ' s age , gender , experience with group decision making , and experience with computers . 4 . 4 . The subjects A total of 22 groups ( 110 subjects ) participated in the study . The subjects were information sys - tems undergraduates from the National Univer - sity of Singapore . They were randomly assigned to groups , which were randomly assigned to treat - ments . This served to control for individual dif - ferences that might affect group decision out - come 15 , 30 . 4 . 5 . Pilot study A pilot study , involving 9 groups ( 45 subjects ) , was conducted to assess the feasibility of the consensus monitor concept . Results showed that groups that used it several times achieved signifi - cantly higher group consensus and perceived de - cision quality . However , because of the small sample size and low statistical power , these find - ings should not be considered conclusive . Never - theless , the pilot study justified the need for more research . 5 . Results A 5 percent level of significance was used for all statistical tests . The t - test and Mann - Whitney B . C .

No significant differences were found for age , gender , experience with group decision making , experience with computers , and time to reach consensus . Hence , these variables were not included as covariates in the actual data analysis . The analysis of covariance ( ANCOVA ) test was used to detect significant effects of the dependent variables . The independent variable was consensus monitor use . The covariate was pre - meeting consensus . Table 1 presents descrip - tive statistics of the covariate and dependent vari - ables . Table 2 shows the results of ANCOVA tests for the dependent variables . All dependent variables met the requirements for homogeneity of variances and normality of error terms 26 . The ANCOVA test has two other requirements relating the dependent vari - ables and covariate : linearity and homogeneity of regressions 24 . Violations of these requirements are not critical if the covariate has a normal distribution 12 . The Shapiro - Wilk ' s test 6 showed that pre - meeting consensus had a normal distribution . 5 . 1 . Post - meeting consensus Both pre - meeting and post - meeting consensus were computed using the fuzzy model .

Consensus monitor use had a significant effect on post - meeting consensus ( p = 0 . 03 ) . Groups that used the consensus monitor several times achieved higher post - meeting consensus than groups that used the consensus monitor only once . Hypothesis 1 was supported . 5 . 2 . Perceived decision quality Perceived decision quality was measured using an instrument with 7 items having unequal weights 16 ( see Table 3 ) . It produces a value ranging from 7 to 49 . The higher the measure , the better the group perception of its decision . These 7 items had a Cronbach ' s alpha 7 of 0 . 81 , satisfy - ing Nunnally ' s 28 criteria for reliability . No sig - nificant effects were observed for perceived deci - sion quality . Hypotheses 2 was not supported . 5 . 3 . Perceived decision process quality An instrument developed by Green and Taber 17 was used to measure perceived decision pro - cess quality ( see Table 4 ) . It has 5 items with equal weight and produces a value ranging from 5 Table 2 Results of ANCOVA tests for dependent variables Consensus monitor use Pre - meeting consensus Interaction Post - meeting consensus Perceived decision quality Perceived decision process quality F = 5 . 54 F = 2 . 27 F = 3 . 07 p = 0 . 03 * p = 0 . 12 p = 0 . 10 F = 1 . 12 F = 0 . 51 F = 2 . 22 p = 0 . 30 p = 0 . 48 p = 0 . 15 F = 1 . 01 F = 0 . 26 F = 1 . 86 p = 0 . 33 p = 0 . 61 p = 0 . 19 p < 0 . 05 . 256 B .

Hypothesis 3 was not supported . 6 . Discussion Consensus is an important group decision out - come . Measures to promote consensus include the use of group techniques and GSS . Group techniques achieve their objective by encouraging personal involvement and highlighting differences in opinions . GSS can incorporate group tech - niques and build on their strengths by providing better ways to highlight differences in opinions through computation . In this study , groups that used the consensus monitor several times achieved better consensus than groups that used it only once . Previous GSS empirical studies involving pref - erence tasks found that the use of group tech - niques raises post - meeting consensus . However , they also reported that the introduction of GSS , on top of group techniques , results in a lowering of post - meeting consensus . Moreover , a GSS did not raise perceived decision quality and perceived decision process quality . Given that consensus attainment is essential for the completion of pref - erence tasks , these findings imply that decision making groups solving preference tasks are not likely to use GSS unless a remedy can be found . This study shows that a consensus monitor is a potential answer . The consensus monitor has helped to promote consensus . Future research should examine whether groups using a GSS with a consensus monitor can outperform groups sup - ported by group techniques in terms of group consensus . The consensus monitor highlights contentious issues for group members . The intention is to help them focus their attention on relevant issues to resolve conflicts . However , it is not known how group members actually used the additional in - formation . Two scenarios are possible . First , group members might have adopted a construc - tive approach and examined all viewpoints on contentious issues to gain a broader perspective before attempting to resolve them . Second , group members might have taken an undesirable ap - proach whereby the more dominating group members used the additional information to help them pinpoint areas where they could apply pres - sure on others . Since a higher consensus level was not accompanied by better perceived decision quality and perceived decision process quality , it is plausible that the second scenario actually re - flects the decision making process of many groups allowed to use the consensus monitor several times . The scenarios represent faithful and ironic use of the consensus monitor respectively 29 . Given that ironic use of decision aids in GSS can result in unintended and undesirable effects , future re - search should investigate how a consensus moni - tor is actually used . Besides identifying the condi - tions under which ironic use of a consensus moni - tor is likely , this knowledge will provide clues on how to minimize ironic use . 7 . Conclusion This study suffers from limitations associated with experimental groups and an artificial setting . Given that the emphasis of an experimental in - vestigation is on internal rather than external validity 2 , any attempt to generalize the findings of this study to other populations and settings must be made with caution . With their computational power and vast stor - age capacities , GSS open up a new avenue to enhance group performance . Group techniques can be combined with statistical or other tech - B . C . Y .
