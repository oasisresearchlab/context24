Waxman Department of Psychology , Northwestern University Although there is considerable evidence that nouns highlight category - based commonalities , includ - ing both those that are perceptually available and those that reﬂect underlying conceptual similarity , some have claimed that words function merely as features of objects . Here , we directly test these alternative accounts . Four - year - olds ( n = 140 ) were introduced to two different novel animals that were highlighted with nouns , adjectives , or stickers . Children heard a nonobvious novel property applied to the ﬁrst animal and were asked whether this property applied to other animals that ﬁlled the similarity space between the original two animals . When the two animals were named with the same noun , children extended the property broadly throughout the similarity space . When the animals were marked with adjectives or stickers , children adopted a similarity - based pattern . These ﬁnd - ings demonstrate clearly that nouns exert a unique effect on categorization—they promote category formation and engage conceptual reasoning beyond perceptual similarity alone . There is now a clear consensus that from infancy through adulthood , naming plays a powerful role , supporting object categorization and inductive reasoning . However , there is considerable controversy concerning the mechanism that underlies this facilitative effect ( e . g . , Gelman & Waxman , 2007 ; Sloutsky , Kloos , & Fisher , 2007 ) . On one account , nouns highlight category - based commonalities , including both those that are perceptually available and those that reﬂect underlying conceptual similarity ( Waxman & Gelman , 2009 ) .

The current experiment was designed to distinguish between these two distinctly different accounts for the naming effect . To begin , we review the evidence for the facilitative role of naming on categorization and induction in infants and preschoolers . Within their ﬁrst year of life , infants show a remarkable sensitivity to words , particularly nouns , when forming object categories ( e . g . , Dewar & Xu , 2007 ; Waxman & Booth , 2001 ) . In the ﬁrst set of experiments to address this question , Waxman and Markow ( 1995 ) demonstrated that providing 13 - month - old infants with the same name for a set of distinct objects ( e . g . , four different animals ) supported the formation of a uniﬁed category ( e . g . , animal ) . In contrast , when the objects were not labeled , infants failed to form the category . This effect has gained converging support from a range of methods ( Plunkett , Hu , & Cohen , 2008 ) . Subsequent research has identiﬁed the speciﬁcity of this phenomenon : naming each dis - tinct object with a unique noun fails to promote object categorization ( Waxman & Braun , 2005 ) . Moreover , other kinds of auditory stimuli , including tones and melodic sequences , fail to facil - itate categorization even when these stimuli are paired consistently with objects ( Fulkerson & Waxman , 2007 ; Waxman & Braun ) . Tracing the developmental origins of this phenomenon , Ferry , Hespos , and Waxman ( 2010 ) document that nouns ( but not tones ) promote object cate - gorization in infants as young as three months of age . Within the second year , infants begin to differentiate among different kinds of novel words ( e . g . , nouns , adjectives , verbs ) when forming novel categories ( Booth & Waxman , 2009 ; Waxman & Booth , 2001 ) . Thus , naming a set of distinct objects with a consistently applied noun highlights commonali - ties among them that might otherwise have gone undetected . In addition , there is strong evidence that by 13 months , naming engages abstract conceptual information ( e . g . , “cause , ” “animacy” ) , in addition to sensory and perceptual features of objects . By 13 months , naming guides infants’ and preschoolers’ inductive inferences about hidden properties ( properties that cannot be discov - ered from perceptual inspection alone ; e . g . , Booth & Waxman , 2002 ; Gelman & Coley , 1990 ; Gelman & Markman , 1986 , 1987 ; Jaswal & Markman , 2007 ) . For example , Graham and col - leagues demonstrated that when novel objects are introduced with the same count noun , 13 - to 22 - month - old infants assume that objects , even those that share only minimal perceptual sim - ilarity , also share a deeper , hidden property ( Graham , Kilbreath , & Welder , 2004 ; Graham & Kilbreath , 2007 ; Welder & Graham , 2001 ) . However , when the same objects are not named , infants assume that only objects that are perceptually very similar share hidden properties ( Graham & Diesendruck , 2010 ) . By 16 months , infants’ expectations about naming and inductive inferences are ﬁnely tuned : Only novel words that are presented referentially , embedded within an intentional naming phrase , and marked as count nouns serve to promote infants’ inferences about hidden properties ( Keates & Graham , 2008 ) . Two alternative accounts have been advanced to account for these striking effects of nouns on categorization and induction . The predominant view is that nouns serve as beacons for con - ceptual categories . That is , noun meanings incorporate abstract conceptual knowledge as well as sensory and perceptual features of objects ( Waxman & Gelman , 2009 ) . Thus , naming objects highlights category - based commonalities , including both those that are perceptually available and those that reﬂect underlying conceptual similarity ( Gelman , 2003 ; Waxman , 2004 ; Waxman & Gelman , 2009 , 2010 ) . But this account has not gone unchallenged . Most recently , Sloutsky and colleagues have asserted that the facilitative effect of nouns on young children’s categoriza - tion is driven by general attentional factors rather than by the relation between the noun and D o w n l o a d e d by [ U n i v e r s it y o f C a l g a r y ] a t 08 : 17 15 A ugu s t 2012 138 GRAHAM , BOOTH , AND WAXMAN the conceptual content of the category ( Napolitano & Sloutsky , 2004 ; Sloutsky & Fisher , 2004 ; Sloutsky & Lo , 1999 ) . On this view , labels are themselves perceptual features that are integrated into similarity computations ( Sloutsky & Fisher , 2004 ; Sloutsky & Lo , 1999 ) . On this account , then , young children’s categorization and induction are based only on the perceptual similarity among entities ; labels contribute to this similarity computation ( e . g . , Sloutsky , 2010 ; Sloutsky , Kloos , & Fisher , 2007 ) . Proponents of this perspective acknowledge that , for adults , nouns may link to conceptual content , but this is not the case during the preschool years ( Sloutsky , 2010 ; Sloutsky & Fisher , 2011 ) . In the current experiment , we evaluate these alternative accounts directly . We focus on 4 - year - olds to address the now - persistent claim that words are merely features of objects for children of this age ( Deng & Sloutsky , 2010 ; Sloutsky , 2010 ) . To do so , we draw upon an elegant design pioneered by Landau and Shipley ( 2001 ) . We present 4 - year - olds with sets of novel animals . Each set includes two standard objects ( Standard A and B ) and three intermediate objects that we created by successively morphing together the two standards . Within this continuous simi - larity space , we selected i ) a high similarity object , ii ) a medium similarity object , and iii ) a low similarity object ( relative to Standard A ) . See Table 1 . The task was straightforward : During the induction phase , the experimenter presented the ﬁrst standard ( Standard A ) from a given set and ascribed to it a hidden novel property ( e . g . , “has sacra inside” ) . She then introduced Standard B , but ascribed to it no property . During the test phase , the experimenter presented the three inter - mediate test objects , asking children to judge whether the novel property , ascribed to Standard A , also applied to that test object . This aspect of the design permitted us to examine children’s ten - dency to infer that the hidden property was shared by other objects , which have not themselves been explicitly named . To adjudicate between the two alternative accounts , we manipulated the type of marker ( novel noun , novel adjective , colorful sticker ) applied to the standards and the consistency with which these were applied . Our reasoning was as follows : On the words - as - features account , any consis - tently applied marker , be it a noun , adjective , or sticker , should ( 1 ) highlight an inclusive category that encompasses the full similarity space between the two standards and ( 2 ) support the infer - ence that the novel property can be ascribed to each . That is , children should treat all three of the test objects identically and infer they all share the nonobvious property . However , on the nouns - link - to - conceptual - content account , only consistently applied nouns should highlight an inclusive category that encompasses the similarity space between the two standards . In all other conditions , children’s generalization of the novel nonobvious properties should vary linearly as a function of the perceptual similarity of the test object to the standard to which it was initially ascribed . METHOD Participants The ﬁnal sample consisted of 140 preschool - aged children ( M = 4 . 70 years , SD = 0 . 29 , range = 4 . 02 – 5 . 31 years ) from primarily Caucasian families of middle - socioeconomic class in which English was the primary language . Children were randomly assigned to conditions , including a No Marker condition and six other conditions in which we varied the type of marker provided D o w n l o a d e d by [ U n i v e r s it y o f C a l g a r y ] a t 08 : 17 15 A ugu s t 2012 INFERENCES ABOUT OBJECT CATEGORIES 139 TABLE 1 Standards and Test Objects Used Set Standards Similarity High Medium Low Standard A1 Standard B1 Standard A2 Standard B2 Standard A3 Standard B3 Standard A4 Standard B4 ( noun , adjective , sticker ) and the consistency ( consistent vs . contrastive ) with which it was applied . See Table 2 for participant details for each condition . Materials The visual materials consisted of four sets of digitally - rendered novel creatures . Each set included two standards ( Standard A and B ) and three test objects : a high similarity object , a medium similarity object , and a low similarity object ( relative to Standard A ; see Table 1 ) . The test objects were created using a commercial morphing program that successively morphed together the two standards . The result was three pictured objects that ﬁlled the similarity space D o w n l o a d e d by [ U n i v e r s it y o f C a l g a r y ] a t 08 : 17 15 A ugu s t 2012 140 GRAHAM , BOOTH , AND WAXMAN TABLE 2 Participant demographics by condition Mean Age SD Range Gender No label 4 . 78 . 25 4 . 43 – 5 . 28 10 males ; 10 females NounConsistent 4 . 68 . 39 4 . 02 – 5 . 31 8 males ; 12 females Contrastive 4 . 79 . 33 4 . 15 – 5 . 23 8 males ; 12 females StickerConsistent 4 . 83 . 25 4 . 37 – 5 . 26 10 males ; 10 females Contrastive 4 . 57 . 31 4 . 08 – 5 . 10 9 males ; 11 females AdjectiveConsistent 4 . 61 . 18 4 . 33 – 4 . 97 11 males ; 9 females Contrastive 4 . 68 . 23 4 . 15 – 5 . 00 11 males ; 9 females between the two standards . For each set , the experimenter introduced a nonobvious property ( has a sacra inside , eats modis , lives in a plinker , needs zavit to live ) . Procedure Children were tested individually either in the lab or in a quiet area of their preschool . Each child ﬁrst participated in three warm - up trials , designed to familiarize them with the task and to assure them that both “yes” and “no” were appropriate responses . During the warm - up , the experimenter introduced two familiar objects ( e . g . , a ball and a dog ) . She labeled one ( e . g . , “this is a dog” ) and simply drew the child’s attention to the other object ( e . g . , “look at this one ! ” ) . She then presented two additional objects , and asked the child whether each was the same kind of thing as the ﬁrst object . After this warm - up , the experimental task began . The novel property assigned within each set was counterbalanced across children . The order of presentation of the three sets , and of the test pictures within each set , was randomized across children . The experimental task , repeated for each set of objects , comprised two phases : an introduction phase followed by a test phase . The introduction phase followed the same structure across the conditions ; what varied was the type of marker provided and the consistency with which it was applied . The experimenter ﬁrst revealed Standard A from a given object set , along with a novel property ( e . g . , “This ( one / X ) has a sacra inside” ) . She then introduced Standard B ( e . g . , “Look at this one / X” ) , with no mention of the property . In the No Marker condition , the experimenter introduced the standards with a general atten - tional phrase ( e . g . , “Look at this one” ) . This condition allowed us to capture children’s baseline patterns of inductive inference in this task . We predicted that children’s extension of the novel property would be based on perceptual similarity between each test object and the standard . More speciﬁcally , we predicted a linear pattern : the more similar each test object was to Standard A , the more likely children would be to extend the novel property to it . In the Consistent Noun condition , the two standards were labeled with the same novel count noun ( e . g . , Look at this dax ) . In the Inconsistent Noun condition , the standards were labeled with two different novel count nouns ( e . g . , dax , cheb ) . We predicted that in the Consistent Noun condition , children would establish a broad inclusive category and would extend the novel D o w n l o a d e d by [ U n i v e r s it y o f C a l g a r y ] a t 08 : 17 15 A ugu s t 2012 INFERENCES ABOUT OBJECT CATEGORIES 141 property broadly and equivalently across all three test objects , but that in the Inconsistent Noun condition , their extension of the novel property would vary as a function of the perceptual similarity between the test object and the standard . In the Consistent Adjective condition , the two category standards were labeled with the same novel adjective ( e . g . , Look at this daxish one ) . In the Inconsistent Adjective condition , the stan - dards were labeled with two different novel adjectives ( e . g . , daxish one , chebish one ) . Here , the different accounts of the naming effect yield divergent predictions . If the link to object kinds is speciﬁc to nouns , then adjectives should fail to support broad and inclusive generalization of nonobvious properties . Instead , preschoolers’ inferences in the Adjective conditions , like those in the No Marker condition , should be guided by perceptual similarity . However , if a word acts merely as an additional feature of the named object , then any consistently applied name , be it a noun or an adjective , should have the same effect on categorization and reasoning . Thus , if the two standards are labeled with the same adjective , children’s performance should mirror that of children in the Consistent Noun condition . Finally , in the Sticker conditions , we introduced a different kind of marker , one that permits us to rule out the inﬂuence of children’s prior experience with different kinds of words . By four years of age , children link novel adjectives speciﬁcally to object properties ( e . g . , color , texture ) and not object categories ( Waxman & Markow , 1998 ; Hall & Moore , 1997 ) ; this could inﬂuence their performance in the current category - based induction task . However , children have no prior expectations about stickers and their links to meaning . In the Consistent Sticker condition , the experimenter placed a small , colorful sticker on each standard , drawing children’s attention to it without a novel label ( e . g . “Look at this ! ” ) . She then removed the sticker and placed it on the second standard . In this way , the sticker was applied at a moment in time , as was the case for the nouns and adjectives , providing a stringent assessment of the nouns as features account . That is , this procedure allows us to assess whether stickers , when introduced in a manner similar to nouns ( i . e . , in a brief pairing ) , function similarly to nouns in guiding generalization . In the Inconsistent Sticker condition , each standard was marked brieﬂy with a different sticker . Here again , the distinct theoretical accounts of the naming effect yield different predictions . If the facilitative effects of naming are based on the conceptual status of count nouns , then marking objects with stickers , however colorful or attention - grabbing they may be , should not inﬂuence generalization . Instead , children should display the baseline similarity - based pattern . However , if nouns exert their effects by simply serving as additional features of objects that ﬁgure into similarity computations , then the Consistent Sticker condition should mirror the Consistent Noun condition . Immediately after the introduction phase , the test phase began . Here , the procedure was iden - tical for children in all conditions . With both standards on the table , the experimenter brought out each test picture , one at a time and in random order , placing each between the two standards , asking , e . g . , “Does this one have a sacra inside ? ” Note that the test pictures were not named or marked in any way . After presenting all three test pictures , the experimenter repeated this procedure for the remaining object sets . Coding and preliminary analyses For each child , we computed the percentage of yes responses to the high , medium , and low similarity test object , averaging across the four object sets . Preliminary analyses revealed no D o w n l o a d e d by [ U n i v e r s it y o f C a l g a r y ] a t 08 : 17 15 A ugu s t 2012 142 GRAHAM , BOOTH , AND WAXMAN main effects or interactions for the child’s gender ; therefore , this factor was not included in the main analyses . RESULTS The results are consistent with the view that the facilitative effect of naming on categorization and induction in preschool - aged children is based on the conceptual status of count nouns , and cannot be explained by appealing to a feature - based account ( see Figure 1 ) . To begin , we characterized children’s patterns of inductive inference in the No Marker con - dition . We submitted children’s extensions of the hidden property in the No Marker condition to an analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) , using their responses to the high , medium , and low similarity test objects as a repeated measure . As predicted , there was a main effect of similarity , F ( 2 , 38 ) = 6 . 93 , η p 2 = . 27 , p < . 01 , and this was characterized by a signiﬁcant linear trend ( high similarity > medium similarity > low similarity ) , F ( 1 , 19 ) = 7 . 91 , η p 2 = . 29 , p < . 05 ( see Figure 1 ) . Thus , in this baseline condition , 4 - year - olds’ tendency to generalize a nonobvious novel property to a test object varied linearly as a function of its similarity to the standard to which the property had been initially ascribed . This provides a foundation for considering the inﬂuence of different kinds of markers . In the next analysis , we considered the effect of the different kinds of markers . We submitted children’s property extensions to a 2 ( Marker type : Noun , Adjective , Sticker ) × 2 ( Consistency : Consistent vs . Contrastive ) × 3 ( Similarity : High , Medium , Low ) mixed factor ANOVA . This analysis yielded signiﬁcant main effects of consistency and similarity , and a signiﬁcant inter - action between these two factors . These were qualiﬁed by a signiﬁcant three - way interaction between marker type , consistency , and similarity , F ( 4 , 228 ) = 2 . 56 , η p 2 = . 04 , p < . 05 ( see Figure 1 ) . Children’s treatment of the test objects varied reliably as a function of the kind of marker they heard applied to the standard , and the consistency with which it was applied . 0 N o M a r k e r C on s i s t e n t N oun C o n s i s t e n t A d j ec ti v e C on s i s t e n t S ti c k e r I n c on s i s t e n t N oun I n c on s i s t e n t A d j ec ti v e I n c on s i s t e n t S ti c k e r 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 High Similarity Medium Similarity Low Similarity FIGURE 1 Generalizations to the test objects as a function of condition .

This is consistent with the nouns - link - to - conceptual - content account . We pursued this interaction more closely by examining performance in each condition . Nouns as Markers . A 2 ( Consistency : Consistent Noun vs . Inconsistent Noun ) × 3 ( Similarity : High , Medium , Low ) ANOVA revealed a signiﬁcant interaction between consistency and simi - larity , F ( 2 , 76 ) = 6 . 17 , η p 2 = . 14 , p < . 01 . In the Consistent Noun condition , children formed an inclusive category and extended the property broadly across all members . Children’s exten - sions to the three test objects were uniformly high ; there was neither a main effect for similarity ( p > . 14 ) nor a linear trend ( high > medium > low ; p > . 42 ) . This suggests that the consistently - applied noun prompted children to treat the test objects as members of an equivalence class , and to use this as a basis for making inferences about properties that they could not observe directly . 1 However , in the Inconsistent Noun condition , performance echoed the similarity - based pattern observed in the No Marker condition : The pattern of linear change across the test objects was signiﬁcant : F ( 1 , 19 ) = 14 . 50 , η p 2 = . 43 , p < . 01 . Adjectives as markers . A 2 ( Consistency : Consistent Adjective vs . Inconsistent Adjective ) × 3 ( Similarity ) ANOVA yielded only a main effect of similarity , F ( 2 , 76 ) = 35 . 42 , η p 2 = . 48 , p < . 001 . Neither the consistency main effect ( F ( 1 , 38 ) = 2 . 78 , η p 2 = . 07 ; p = . 10 ) nor the consistency by similarity interaction was signiﬁcant ( F ( 2 , 76 ) = 1 . 62 , η p 2 = . 04 , p = . 20 ) . In both Adjective conditions , children displayed a similarity - based extension pattern , mirroring that in the No Marker condition . That is , their tendency to extend the property to a test object varied linearly as a function of its similarity to the standard initially assigned the property , F ( 1 , 38 ) = 52 . 49 , η p 2 = . 58 , p < . 001 . Stickers as markers . When the standards were marked with stickers , the results mirrored those in the No Label and Adjective conditions . The 2 ( Consistency : Consistent Sticker vs . Inconsistent Sticker ) × 3 ( Similarity ) ANOVA yielded only a main effect of similarity , F ( 2 , 76 ) = 12 . 29 , η p 2 = . 24 , p < . 001 . Neither the main effect of consistency ( F ( 1 , 38 ) = 1 . 59 , η p 2 = . 04 , p = . 22 ) nor the interaction between consistency and similarity , ( F ( 2 , 76 ) = 1 . 25 , η p 2 = . 03 , p = . 29 ) were signiﬁcant . As in the No Marker and Adjective conditions , the pattern of linear change across the test objects was signiﬁcant : F ( 1 , 38 ) = 18 . 74 , η p 2 = . 33 , p < . 001 , indicating that children in both Sticker conditions generalized on basis of perceptual similarity . DISCUSSION The goal of this experiment was to adjudicate between two distinctly different accounts of the role of naming in categorization and induction , namely , the proposal that the link between nam - ing and categorization is based on the conceptual status of count nouns versus the proposal that words are merely features of the objects to which they are applied . To differentiate between these accounts , we systematically varied : a ) the types of markers applied to two category standards ; and b ) the consistency with which they were applied . We then examined children’s inferences about 1 Analyses comparing children’s generalizations to the Low Similarity objects to chance - levels indicate that only generalizations in the Consistent Noun condition were above chance - levels ( p < . 0001 ) .

Our ﬁndings demon - strate that nouns ( but not adjectives or stickers ) facilitated categorization and guided children’s inductive inferences , but only if the same noun was applied consistently to both standards . In the Consistent Noun condition , and in this condition only , children formed an inclusive category , one that encompassed all the test objects between the two perceptually dissimilar standards , despite the fact that none of these test objects had themselves been explicitly named . This effect was speciﬁc to consistently applied novel nouns . When the two standards were marked with novel adjectives or with stickers , children displayed a similarity - based extension pattern , regardless of whether the standards were marked with the same or different labels . This outcome challenges the claim that nouns act as additional features of the objects to which they are applied . If this were the case , then any shared feature — be it a noun , an adjective , or even a sticker — should increase the perceived similarity of the two standards . Instead , the current ﬁndings underscore that nouns play a special role in promoting object categorization and supporting category - based inductive inferences . When considered in conjunction with other recent evidence from infants and preschoolers ( e . g . , Ferry et al . , 2010 ; Gelman & Markman , 1987 ; Gelman & Coley , 1990 ; Keates & Graham , 2008 ; Jaswal , 2004 ; Jaswal & Markman , 2007 ; Waxman & Markow , 1995 ; Waxman & Booth , 2001 ) , our ﬁndings reveal that nouns inﬂuence conceptual organization in a way that is not evident for other kinds of markers . Naming diverse objects with the same noun promotes cat - egorization and supports inductive inferences , even for properties that are nonobvious and even when the test objects themselves have not been named . Although the effect of nouns is clear , it is important to note that there are other routes to establishing membership in an object kind ( e . g . , shared functions for artifacts , essential properties for natural kinds , or causal properties more generally speaking ) ( Booth , 2008 ; Booth & Waxman , 2002 ) . In closing , our ﬁndings provide clear support for the proposal that nouns are an index of shared membership in a category of like kinds ( Gelman , 2003 ; Waxman , 2004 ; Waxman & Gelman , 2009 , 2010 ) . This work also highlights that there is considerable continuity across development in the link between count nouns , object categories , and category - based inductive inferences .
