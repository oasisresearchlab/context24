Editorial Gender balance in Cortex acceptance rates Laura Valkonen * and Joanna Brooks Human Cognitive Neuroscience , Department of Psychology , University of Edinburgh , UK The question of whether or not women are under - represented in science continues to be fervently researched . Gender inequalities in science and academia have been widely dis - cussed and arguably stem from complex sociocultural issues . It has recently been reported that women continue to account for just 30 % of all researchers across the European Union ( She Figures 2009 ) e or a quarter of researchers worldwide e and continue to have less opportunities for research and devel - opment compared to their male counterparts ( The World’s Women Report , 2010 ) . An excellent discussion of women and science , with a review of 20 years of research on the subject , has recently been provided by Ceci and Williams ( 2010 ) who recognise that over the past thirty years the representation of women in science has dramatically increased ; more than half of the PhDs in life sciences and social sciences are now being awarded to women . Another positive change has been in scientiﬁc publishing ; here , gender equality is of particular importance given that the dissemi - nation of scientiﬁc material is often representative of a researcher’s merit in the ﬁeld and may strongly inﬂuence career opportunities like salary , promotion , and collaboration . While it has been previously noted that 43 % of female faculty members , compared to 23 % of their male counterparts , have never published a journal article ( Schneider , 1998 ) , the proportion of women publishing scientiﬁc material has increased in dermatology journals between 1976 and 2006 ( Feramisco et al . , 2009 ) ; in British medical journals between 1970 and 2004 ( Sidhu et al . , 2009 ) ; and in American medical journals between 1970 and 2004 ( Jagsi et al . , 2006 ) . A similar pattern has also been demonstrated for Cortex ( Brooks and Della Sala , 2009 ) . In order to continue to evaluate whether Cortex is gender balanced we compared the submission and acceptance rates for male and female authored papers over a recent three - year period : those submitted to the journal between 1st January 2007 and 31st December 2009 . We considered only papers classiﬁed as ‘Research Reports’ , ‘Notes’ , ‘Clinical Neuroanatomy’ and ‘Reviews’ , excluding Special Issue papers and other article types from the analysis . The source items were divided into two groups according to the gender of the ﬁrst author . When the gender could not be ascertained , that article was not considered . To maintain conﬁdentiality , the gender analysis was conducted by the journal’s editorial assistant . In the years 2007 to 2009 there were 523 source items submitted to Cortex for peer - review ( 133 in 2007 , 181 in 2008 and 209 in 2009 ) . For 12 of these papers the gender of the ﬁrst author could not be ascertained , so they were excluded from the analysis . Of the remaining 511 papers , 258 ( 50 . 5 % ) were submitted by male ﬁrst authors and 253 ( 49 . 5 % ) by female ﬁrst authors . The overall acceptance rate in this period was 33 . 5 % , with 171 of the submitted articles eventually being accepted for publication . Sorting by gender , 89 of the accepted papers were from male ﬁrst authors , while 82 were from female ﬁrst authors , so the acceptance rates for male and female authors were 34 . 5 % and 32 . 4 % respectively . A goodness of ﬁt chi - square test showed no signiﬁcant difference between male and female ﬁrst authors in the observed frequencies of submitted papers [ c 2 ( 1 , N ¼ 511 ) ¼ . 05 , p ¼ . 82 ] and a test of independence also showed the relationship between gender and acceptance rate to be nonsigniﬁcant [ c 2 ( 1 , N ¼ 511 ) ¼ . 25 , p ¼ . 62 ] . The accepted papers are listed in Table 1 according to ﬁrst author gender . The balanced numbers of male and female ﬁrst author papers submitted for publication in Cortex between 2007 and 2009 , as well as the similar acceptance rates , suggest that Cortex is not currently subject to a gender imbalance in this domain . This reﬂects well on our journal and suggests that submitted papers are being assessed according to rigorous peer - review procedures independent of the gender of the ﬁrst * Corresponding author .
