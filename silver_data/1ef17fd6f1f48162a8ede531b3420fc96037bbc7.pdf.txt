We used comparative proteomics to identify PTRF ( also called Cav - p60 , Cavin ) as a putative caveolar coat protein . PTRF - Cavin selectively associates with mature cav - eolae at the plasma membrane but not Golgi - local - ized caveolin . In prostate cancer PC3 cells , and during development of zebraﬁsh notochord , lack of PTRF - Cavin expression correlates with lack of caveolae , and caveolin resides on ﬂat plasma mem - brane . Expression of PTRF - Cavin in PC3 cells is suf - ﬁcient to cause formation of caveolae . Knockdown of PTRF - Cavin reduces caveolae density , both in mam - malian cells and in the zebraﬁsh . Caveolin remains on the plasma membrane in PTRF - Cavin knockdown cells but exhibits increased lateral mobility and accelerated lysosomal degradation . We conclude that PTRF - Cavin is required for caveola formation and sequestration of mobile caveolin into immobile caveolae . INTRODUCTION Caveolae are a characteristic and abundant morphological fea - ture of many mammalian cells . Caveolae have been implicated in numerous functions including cell signaling , lipid regulation , and endocytosis . The only known structural proteins of caveolae are members of the caveolin family , caveolin - 1 ( Cav1 ) , caveolin - 2 ( Cav2 ) , and caveolin - 3 ( Cav3 ) . Cav1 is expressed in nonstriated muscle cells and drives caveolae formation . Caveolae are absent from nonmuscle tissues of Cav1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) animals ( Drab et al . , 2001 ) and ectopic expression of Cav1 in cells lacking caveolae leads to de novo caveolae formation ( Fra et al . , 1995 ) . Cav3 is ex - pressed in skeletal and cardiac muscle ( Pol et al . , 2005 ; Way and Parton , 1995 ) and is required for caveolae formation in these cells ( Galbiati et al . , 2001 ; Hagiwara et al . , 2000 ) . In contrast , Cav2 is not required for caveolae formation ( Razani et al . , 2002 ) , and its transport to the plasma membrane is dependent on Cav1 expression ( Parolini et al . , 1999 ) . Cav1 binds cholesterol ( Murata et al . , 1995 ) and forms higher - order oligomers ( Monier et al . , 1996 ) . These properties are believed to be important for generation of the characteristic structure of caveolae , each of whichcontainsapproximately144caveolinmolecules ( Pelkmans and Zerial , 2005 ) . Caveolae may be generated in the Golgi com - plex , as a unit that fuses directly with the plasma membrane ( Ta - gawaetal . , 2005 ) . Whiletheroleofcaveolinincaveolaeformation is therefore well established ( Parton et al . , 2006 ) , it is not known whether other proteins are required for caveolae formation or if they can regulate the balance between caveolae formation and disassembly . Caveolae play an important role in the regulation of many cel - lular functions . For example , downregulation of Cav1 has been correlated with cell transformation and tumor invasion ( Williams and Lisanti , 2005 ) . Precisely how caveolae / caveolins regulates cellular processes remains unclear . In contrast to the dynamic transient nature of many signal transduction complexes , caveo - lae are generally extremely stable structures ( Tagawa et al . , 2005 ; Thomsen et al . , 2002 ) . The caveolar unit stays intact de - spite cycles of endocytosis , fusion with the caveosome or endo - somes , and recycling back to the plasma membrane ( Pelkmans and Zerial , 2005 ) . However , caveolin becomes mobile upon cho - lesterol depletion and a large - scale screen identiﬁed kinases that when downregulated cause signiﬁcant changes in caveolin dis - tribution ( Pelkmans et al . , 2005 ) . This suggests that the formation of the caveolar unit may be regulated . To gain further insights into caveolar function we utilized comparative proteomics of Cav1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) and wild - type ( WT ) mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts and found Polymerase I and transcript Cell 132 , 113 – 124 , January 11 , 2008 ª 2008 Elsevier Inc . 113 release factor , PTRF , to be targeted to detergent - resistant mem - branes ( DRM ) in a Cav1 - dependent manner . PTRF , also called Cav - p60 or Cavin , was previously localized to caveolae by the group of Tranum - Jensen using antibodies derived from rat adipocyte membranes ( Vinten et al . , 2001 , 2005 ; Voldstedlund et al . , 2001 , 2003 ) . More recently , PTRF was identiﬁed as a com - Figure 1 . Identiﬁcation of PTRF as a Protein Enriched in Cav1 - Containing DRM ( A and B ) DRM prepared from WT and Cav1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) MEF were analyzed by ( A ) SDS - PAGE ( 5 % – 15 % ) and col - loidalCoomassiestainingor ( B ) 2Dgelelectrophoresis ( pH 3 – 10 , 12 % ) and silver staining .

PTRF is a soluble protein with putative leu - cine zipper , nuclear localization sequences , and PEST domains ( Aboulaich et al . , 2004 ; Gustincich et al . , 1999 ) . We now show that PTRF - Cavin is required for formation of cav - eolae in cultured cells and zebraﬁsh embryo . RESULTS Analysis of DRM from WT and Cav1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) MEFs Reveal Minor Differences in Presence / Absence of Caveolin In order to identify putative caveolae pro - teins , weemployedacomparativeproteomic screen using detergent - resistant mem - branes ( DRM ) prepared from WT and Cav1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) murine embryonic ﬁbroblasts ( MEFs ) . While DRM do not equate to caveo - lae or lipid raft domains ( Lichtenberg et al . , 2005 ) , this strategy represents a nonbiased approach to identify proteins recruited to this fraction , directly or indirectly , by caveo - lin . Since Cav1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) cells are devoid of mor - phological caveolae , proteins that are absent in Cav1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) DRM compared to WT DRM are expected to be components of caveolae . As shown in Figure 1 , the protein proﬁle for WT and Cav1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) DRM are extremely similar , both on SDS - PAGE ( Figure 1A ) and on 2DE ( Figure 1B ) , consistent with the fact that caveolae proteins represent only a minor proportion of the total DRM proteins . To identify proteins speciﬁc to WT DRM , gel slices were excised from entire lanes of Coomassie - stained SDS - PAGE , 114 Cell 132 , 113 – 124 , January 11 , 2008 ª 2008 Elsevier Inc . digested with trypsin , and analyzed by MS / MS . After two inde - pendent TOF - TOF analyses , 53 common proteins were identi - ﬁed in WT and Cav1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) DRM , while 8 proteins were found to be preferentially enriched in WT DRM and 6 proteins enriched in Cav1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) DRM . PTRF was identiﬁed as a protein preferentially enriched in WT DRM ( Figure 1C ) . In addition , a related protein , serum - deprivation response protein ( SDPR ) was also found enriched in WT DRM ( Figure 1C ) . Consistent with the proteomic data , western blotting showed that a PTRF immunoreactive band of 60 kDa was signiﬁcantly reduced in Cav1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) DRM ( Figure 1D ) . This difference was con - sistently observed in numerous DRM preparations , while the abundance of many other signaling proteins were found to be similar between WT and Cav1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) DRM , including eNOS , Src , PKB , and Fyn ( Figure 1D ) . Indeed , the only signaling protein we found to target to DRM in a Cav1 - dependent manner was protein kinase C a ( PKC a , Figure 1D ) . To examine whether the re - duction of PTRF in Cav1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) DRM is a result of an overall reduc - tion in PTRF protein , we performed immunoblotting for PTRF in MEF whole cell lysates , as well as lysates of adult mouse tissues ( Figure 1E ) . The expression of PTRF was similar in WT and Cav1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) MEF whole cell lysates ( Figure 1E ) . In adult mouse tis - sues , PTRF showed an expression pattern that strictly correlated with caveolin , with highest expression in lung , fat , and adrenal gland , and intermediate expression in heart and skeletal muscle ( Figure 1E ) . A second PTRF - immunoreactive band at 25 kDa was detected in mouse tissues but not in MEFs ( Figure 1E ) . The inten - sity of this band paralleled that of full - length PTRF in most tis - sues , suggesting that it may be a degradation product , possibly corresponding to the reported cleaved PTRF ( Aboulaich et al . , 2004 ) . Intriguingly , PTRF expression is dramatically reduced in Cav1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) adult mouse tissues ( Figure 1E ) , strongly suggesting that these two proteins are functionally linked . PTRF Associates with Caveolae PTRF was recently identiﬁed as a component of immunopuriﬁed caveolae from human adipocytes ( Aboulaich et al . , 2004 ) , and as cav - p60 , a protein previously localized to rat adipocyte caveolae ( Vinten et al . , 2005 ) . To conﬁrm the subcellular localization of PTRF in ﬁbroblasts , we performed immunoﬂuorescence ( IF ) con - focal microscopy in WT MEF and NIH 3T3 cells . In addition to a cytosolic pool , PTRF showed punctate cell surface staining , which colocalized with Cav1 - enriched regions of the plasma membrane ( Figures 2A and 2B ) . Detailed analysis of the confocal images revealed that all plasma membrane Cav1 puncta were colabeled with PTRF , whereas a small number of Cav1 - free PTRF puncta could also be detected . To conﬁrm that PTRF is localizing to caveolae , we performed immunoelectron micros - copy ( immuno - EM ) on plasma membrane lawns ( Prior et al . , 2003 ) generated from baby hamster kidney ( BHK ) cells cotrans - fected with Cav1 - mGFP and PTRF - RFP . Cav1 and PTRF were detected by GFP and RFP antibodies coupled to 6 nm and 2 nm gold , respectively . As shown in Figure 2C , Cav1 and PTRF both labeled caveolae , although low levels of expressed PTRF were also detected on ﬂat membrane . By IF , Cav1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) MEF showed a diffuse distribution of either en - dogenous or ectopically expressed PTRF ( Figures 2D and 2E ) , consistent with limited plasma membrane association or binding to ﬂat membrane . To determine whether the alteration of PTRF subcellular localization in Cav1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) , MEF was a direct result of loss of Cav1 , Cav1 was re - expressed in Cav1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) MEF . Immu - noblotting showed that expression of Cav1 caused recruitment of PTRF to the DRM fraction ( Figure 3A ) , and IF analysis showed recruitment of PTRF to caveolin - enriched puncta at the plasma membrane ( Figure 3B ) . These results show that Cav1 is neces - sary and sufﬁcient to recruit PTRF to the plasma membrane . In addition to the cell surface , caveolins are also present in the Golgi complex in many cells , corresponding to a pool of newly synthesized protein ( Nichols , 2002 ; Pol et al . , 2005 ) . As Cav1 recruits PTRF to the plasma membrane we investigated whether PTRF is also recruited to the Golgi complex . Endogenous PTRF colocalized with Cav1 at the plasma membrane but not at the Golgi complex in WT MEF ( Figure 2A ) and NIH 3T3 ﬁbroblasts ( Figure 2B ) . Expression of Cav1 or Cav3 in Cav1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) MEFs is Figure 2 . PTRF Associates with Caveolae ( A and B ) WT MEF ( A ) and NIH 3T3 ( B ) ﬁbroblasts grown on coverslips were labeled for endogenous Cav1 and PTRF , then examined by confocal micros - copy . In both cell types Cav1 and PTRF show extensive colocalization in cell surface puncta . Bars , 10 m m .

Expression of Cav1 ( Figure 3B ) or Cav3 ( Figure 3C ) in Cav1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) MEFs also caused the recruitment of PTRF to the plasma membrane , but not the Golgi complex ( arrowheads in Figure 3C ) . To further char - acterize this apparent selectivity for caveolin at the plasma mem - brane , we examined a series of caveolin mutants with different subcellular localizations . Golgi - associated mutants of Cav3 , such as Cav3P104L , were unableto recruit PTRF ( Figure 3D ) . An - othermutant , Cav3C71W , whichlocalizesboth tothecellsurface ( to generate caveolae , data not shown ) , and the Golgi complex shows recruitment of PTRF to the cell surface but not to the Golgi complex ( Figure 3E , arrowhead ) . To further clarify the requirement of caveola formation in PTRF recruitment , we assessed the ability of caveolins from different species—ranging from mammals to invertebrates—to recruit PTRF . In agreement with the results from caveolin mutants , there was a strict correlation between caveolae formation and PTRF recruitment ( Figures 3F – 3H ) . Caveolin from C . elegans , which is also surface localized but is unable to generate caveolae , did not recruit PTRF to the plasma membrane ( Figure 3F ) . In con - trast , zebraﬁsh caveolin generated caveolae and recruited PTRF to the plasma membrane ( Figure 3H ) . Remarkably , an inverte - brate caveolin from the honey bee A . mellifera , which generated caveolae , caused PTRF recruitment ( Figure 3G ) . Hybrid proteins between mammalian and CeCav also showed the same correla - tion between caveolae formation and PTRF recruitment ( Figure S2 ) , further strengthening the conclusion that only plasma membrane caveolar caveolin recruits PTRF . PTRF and Caveolin Are in Close Proximity at the Plasma Membrane The above results prompted us to examine the possible interac - tion between PTRF and caveolin . We employed the in situ tech - niques of sensitized acceptor emission and ﬂuorescence lifetime imaging ( FLIM ) and ﬂuorescence resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) to examine whether PTRF and caveolin are in close prox - imity . For FRET studies , monomeric ﬂuorescent proteins were used to tag PTRF and Cav1 , and then cotransfected into BHK cells . FRET was detected in vesicular structures , which lined the plasma membrane and were also distributed in the cell pe - riphery ( Figures 4A and S3 ) . All structures where mCFP - PTRF and Cav1 - mCit colocalized displayed FRET with an efﬁciency of 10 % – 20 % . For FLIM studies , mGFP - PTRF was transfected into BHK cells or cotransfected with mRFP - Cav3 , and its ﬂuores - cence lifetime measured . The ﬂuorescence lifetime of mGFP - PTRF was signiﬁcantly reduced ( p < 0 . 0001 ) when mRFP - Cav3 was coexpressed ( Figure 4B ) . We further estimate that approxi - mately 20 % of PTRF molecules are sufﬁciently proximate to an mRFP - Cav3 acceptor molecule to undergo FRET ( Figure 4B ) . Taken together , these results show that PTRF and caveolin are closely associated at the plasma membrane . To gain additional insights into the mechanism of PTRF recruit - ment to caveolae , we estimated the stoichiometry of PTRF re - cruitment to DRM by caveolin . mGFP - PTRF and Cav3 - mGFP were cotransfected in Cav1 (cid:2) / (cid:2) MEF at a ratio of 3 : 1 , so that all cells expressing mGFP - PTRF should express Cav3 - mGFP . DRMs were prepared and examined by immunoblotting with anti - GFP antibody . As expected , cotransfection of Cav3 - mGFP with mGFP - PTRF caused a recruitment of mGFP - PTRF to the DRM ( Figure S4 ) . In control dishes where GFP was used in place of Cav3 - mGFP , only a trace amount of mGFP - PTRF was de - tected in the DRM ( Figure S4 ) . Quantitative immunoblotting esti - mated the ratio of Cav3 - mGFP to mGFP - PTRF in the DRM to be 5 . 5 ± 1 . 9 ( range between 2 . 1 and 8 . 6 , n = 3 ) . The high variation of Figure 3 .

NIH 3T3 cells trans - fected with either Cav3 - mGFP or PTRF - mGFP were imaged by confocal microscopy using the same capture conditions in each case . Mean gray level values were measured for particles that ﬁtted within a 0 . 177 m m 2 circle , with the assumptions that Figure 4 . PTRF and Caveolin Interacts in a Cholesterol - Dependent Manner ; PTRF Is Required for Caveola Formation in PC3 Cells ( A ) BHK cells were transiently transfected with mCFP - PTRF and mCit - Cav1 . The distribution of mCFP - PTRF is observed in the donor channel and mCit - Cav1 in the acceptor channel image . FRET was observed in vesicular structures along the plasma membrane ( arrowheads ) and at the cell periphery ( arrows ) . FRET was calculated per pixel as a sensitized acceptor emission index FR , ranging from 1 ( no FRET ) to 10 . Overlay of a binary colocalization image ( green pixels ) and a binary FRETimage showing all pixels withFR > 2inblack revealed that all structures where mCFP - PTRF and mCit - caveolin - 1 colocalized also exhibited FRET .

Representative FLIM images are shown and the ﬂuorescence life - time ( ns ) of mGFP displayed as a heat map . In the presence of the acceptor mRFP the lifetime of the donor mGFP is signiﬁcantly decreased ; this was quantiﬁed by calculating the mean lifetime of mGFP on a cell - by - cell basis ( mean ± SEM , n R 50 cells from three independent experiments ) . The reduced mGFP lifetime reﬂects FRET be - tween mGFP and mRFP as a result of the molecu - lar proximity of PTRF and Cav3 .

Control cells show few uncoated invaginations with the morphology of caveolae ; note the 120 nm coated vesicle ( arrowhead ) . In transfected cells , numerous uncoated pits ( arrowheads ) with the typical morphology of single caveolae and caveolae rosettes are evident . Caveolae density increased from 0 . 26 ± 0 . 13 caveolae per ﬁeld in control cells to 1 . 70 ± 0 . 94 in PTRF transfected cells . Transfection efﬁciency was approximately 50 % . Bars , 200 nm .

The mean gray level value for Cav3 and PTRF was 22 . 28 ± 0 . 46 ( n = 127 ) and 23 . 45 ± 0 . 62 ( n = 100 ) , suggesting that caveolin and PTRF are present in an approximate 1 : 1 ratio within caveolae . Coimmunoprecipitation of PTRF with Cav1 , with and without in vivo crosslinking , using either PTRF , caveolin , GFP , or Flag an - tibodies under different solubilization conditions provided equiv - ocal results ( data not shown ) . This raises the possibility that PTRF associates with the speciﬁc lipid environment generated by caveolin . Cav1 binds cholesterol ( Murata et al . , 1995 ) , and de - pletion of cellular cholesterol results in a loss of morphological caveolae ( Hailstones et al . , 1998 ) . To determine if PTRF - caveolin interaction requires cholesterol , we used methyl - b - cyclodextrin to extract cholesterol and then examined the interaction by FLIM . Cholesterol depletion to (cid:3) 50 % attenuates PTRF - caveolin interaction as measured by an increase in the ﬂuorescence life - time of mGFP - PTRF ( Figure 4C ) , correlating with the reported loss of morphological caveolae under these conditions ( Hail - stones et al . , 1998 ) . PTRF shares sequence homology with SDPR and SRBC ( serum deprivation response - related gene product that binds to c - kinase ) , both of which have been shown tobindphosphatidylserine ( PS ) ( Burgeneretal . , 1990 ; Gustincich et al . , 1999 ; Izumi et al . , 1997 ) , and caveolin peptides have been reported to generate PS - rich domains in vitro ( Wanaski et al . , 2003 ) . We therefore examined if PTRF could bind PS in vitro . Recombinant PTRF bound pure PS in a solid - phase assay , with the interaction completely lost when phosphatidylcholine ( PC ) was included at a 50 - fold excess ( Figure 4D ) . This interaction wasfurtherconﬁrmedusingaliposomecentrifugationassay ( Fig - ure 4E ) . Taken together the results suggest that PTRF is a PS - binding protein , which is recruited to caveolae in a cholesterol - dependent manner and is an abundant component of caveolae . PTRF Is Required for Caveola Formation in PC3 Cells In view of the strict association of PTRF with caveolae , we tested the hypothesis that PTRF aids caveola formation . Screening a panel of cell lines revealed that protein levels of PTRF and Cav1 closely parallel each other in most cell lines ( data not shown ) , with the exception of the prostate cancer cell line PC3 , which expressed abundant Cav1 but no detectable PTRF ( Fig - ure 4F ) . By IF , caveolin showed a diffuse staining in PC3 cells ( Figure4G , cellonright ) , similarto C . elegans caveolin ( Figure3F ) , which targets to the plasma membrane but does not form caveo - lae . In agreement with this , electron microscopic analysis of ruthenium red surface - labeled cells showed extremely low levels of morphologically recognizable caveolae ( Figure 4H , occupying < 0 . 2 % of the plasma membrane surface as estimated by sterol - ogy ) . Transfection of PTRF caused a dramatic change in Cav1 distribution by IF , with large puncta now visible in the transfected cells ( Figure 4G , cell on left ) . The transfected cells were pro - cessed for electron microscopy ( Figure 4H ) , and caveolae den - sity in the transfected cell population was quantitated in a blind fashion in comparison to control cells . Although the transfection efﬁciency was less than 50 % , the caveolae density dramatically increased upon PTRF transfection with a 6 . 5 - fold increase as measured over the entire population ( 0 . 26 ± 0 . 13 caveolae per ﬁeld to 1 . 70 ± 0 . 94 ) . Caveolae were evident as single structures on the plasma membrane and in the characteristic surface - con - nected ‘‘caves’’ or rosette structures described in many cell types ( Figure 4H ) . We conclude that PTRF is limiting for caveola formation in this prostate cancer cell line . Downregulation of PTRF Causes Loss of Surface Caveolae To further test the role of PTRF in caveolae formation , NIH 3T3 ﬁbroblast cell lines with reduced PTRF levels were generated by stable expression of shRNA ( shPTRF ) and compared to con - trol lines generated in parallel with either a scrambled shRNA vector or shRNA directed against Cav3 ( shCON , note that Cav3 is not expressed in NIH 3T3 ﬁbroblasts ) . A reduction of PTRF expression by 80 % – 95 % caused a 10 % – 50 % reduction of Cav1 protein levels in different cell lines ( an example is shown in Figure 5A ) ; however , the majority of Cav1 still localized to the DRM fraction ( Figure 5A ) . By IF , endogenous Cav1 showed a dif - fuse surface distribution in shPTRF cells ( Figure 5B ) , in contrast to the characteristic linear and / or punctate distribution in paren - tal NIH 3T3 ﬁbroblasts ( Figure 2B ) or shCON cells ( Figure 5B ) . Importantly , we were able to restore the characteristic Cav1 staining pattern in shPTRF cells by re - expressing GFP - PTRF to high levels to partially overcome the shRNA inhibition ( Figure 5C ) . To examine the effect of PTRF knockdown on caveolae , we used ruthenium red to label the cell surface of shCON and shPTRF cells . Control cells showed abundant 60 – 80 nm invagi - nations of the cell surface , characteristic of caveolae ( Figure 5D ) . In contrast , caveolae were rare in shPTRF cells ( Figure 5E ) . This was quantitated in a blind fashion using two independent methods and compared to the level of caveolae observed in Cav1 knockdown cells generated using shRNA in NIH 3T3 cells ( Figure S5 ) . The percentage of the cell surface occupied by cav - eolae decreased from 10 . 9 % ± 1 . 11 % ( n = 76 ﬁelds ) in shCON cells to 3 . 45 % ± 0 . 43 % ( n = 65 ﬁelds ) in shPTRF cells and 2 . 60 % ± 0 . 64 % in shCav1 cells ( n = 54 ﬁelds ) , as measured by standard stereological methods on random sections . Similar re - sults were obtained by independent quantitation of caveolae numbers per ﬁeld in random areas of the cell surface . This corre - sponds to a decrease of caveolae density of 68 % upon PTRF downregulation , as compared to 76 % upon Cav1 knockdown using similar methods and quantitated in parallel . There was no evidence of abnormal caveolae formation in either case . To investigate the distribution of Cav1 in shPTRF cells we per - formed quantitative immuno - EM on frozen sections . In control cells ( shCON ) the majority of Cav1 labeling ( 81 . 7 % ± 4 . 6 % of sur - face labeling ) was associated with 65 nm vesicles close to , or clearly connected to , the plasma membrane ( Figures 6A and 6B ) . In contrast , in shPTRF cells the bulk of plasma membrane labeling was associated with noncaveolar plasma membrane ( 79 . 1 % ± 5 . 3 % , Figures 6C – 6E ) . The remaining 21 % of surface gold associated with caveolae may reﬂect the incomplete knock - down of PTRF . Total labeling for Cav1 ( gold particles per random ﬁeld ) was decreased approximately 25 % in shPTRF cells , al - thoughitisimportanttonotethatwecannotassumesimilarlabel - ing efﬁciency for Cav1 in caveolae and ﬂat plasma membrane . To our surprise , in shPTRF cells , a signiﬁcant , although low , fraction of Cav1 was observed in clathrin - coated pits ( for example , see 118 Cell 132 , 113 – 124 , January 11 , 2008 ª 2008 Elsevier Inc . inset Figure S7A ) . Although less than 1 % of total Cav1 labeling , the signiﬁcance of this association was indicated by the total ab - sence of Cav1 labeling in clathrin - coated pits of shCON cells labeled in parallel . Consistent with association of Cav1 with the endocytic pathway upon PTRF downregulation , Cav1 labeling was observed in endocytic structures , including multivesicular putative late endosomes in shPTRF cells but not in shCON cells ( Figures S7A and S7B ) . Together with the observed decrease in Cav1 levels , this raised the possibility that PTRF knockdown could allow Cav1 to be internalized and degraded . Consistent with this , cycloheximide chase experiments showed signiﬁcant degradation of Cav1 within 6 – 8 hr in shPTRF cells but not shCON cells ( Figure 6F ) . This downregulation of Cav1 was completely in - hibitedbytreatmentwithlysosomalinhibitors ( resultsnotshown ) . Figure 5 .

Abundant caveolae , surface pits of approximately 65 nm di - ameter , are apparent close to the surface of shCON cells ( arrowheads ) but rarely in shPTRF cells . Caveolae density ( ± SEM ) was quantitated ( F ) from three independent experiments as de - scribed in Experimental Procedures . * p < 0 . 005 Bars , 200 nm . The low level of labeling of the Golgi com - plex , was similar in control and shPTRF cells ( Figures S7C and S7D ) , consistent with the hypothesis that the principal role for PTRF is to stabilize caveolin at the plasma membrane rather than facili - tate Golgi exit . Caveolin in caveolae are reported to be relatively immobile but can be mobilized upon cholesterol depletion ( Thomsen et al . , 2002 ) . To examine if release of cav - eolin by PTRF knockdown has a similar effect , we performed FRAP ( ﬂuorescence recovery after photo - bleaching ) analysis on yellow ﬂuorescent protein ( YFP ) - tagged Cav1 transfected in shCON versus shPTRF cells ( Figure 6G ) . Consistent with previous reports ( Thomsen et al . , 2002 ) , Cav1 - YFP mobility was extremely low in control cells , with an immobile fraction of 0 . 778 ( Figure 6B ) . The immobile fraction of Cav1 - YFP in shPTRF cells was signiﬁcantly decreased to 0 . 369 ( Figure 6B ) , reminiscent of that seen in cholesterol - depleted cells ( Thomsen et al . , 2002 ) . In contrast , the half - life of ﬂuorescence recovery was not signiﬁcantly different in the two cell lines . The mobile fraction in each cell type ( 22 % and 63 % for shCON and shPTRF , respectively ) are not signiﬁcantly different ( t 2 = 1 . 45 , p = 0 . 228 ) to the percentage of noncaveolar Cav1 observed in the immuno - EM analysis ( 18 % and 79 % , respectively ) . Cell 132 , 113 – 124 , January 11 , 2008 ª 2008 Elsevier Inc . 119 Taken together , these results suggest that PTRF is required to stabilize caveolin in caveolae at the plasma membrane . Loss of PTRF causes caveolin to diffuse freely in the plasma membrane and to become internalized ( presumably as a passive bulk ﬂow marker ) into the endolysosomal system where degradation oc - curs . These data agree with a model in which sequestration of caveolin into caveolae , promoted by PTRF , causes stable con - ﬁnement of caveolin , thus protecting it from degradation . PTRF Is Required for Caveola Formation and Notochord Structure in Zebraﬁsh In order to determine whether PTRF was also required for cav - eola formation in vivo we made use of the zebraﬁsh , Danio rerio . We have recently demonstrated the high expression of Cav1 Figure 6 .

Tubulin was used as a loading control . Graph represents data ( ± SEM ) from two independent experiments . ( G ) PTRF knockdown results in a highly signiﬁcant in - crease ( p < 0 . 001 ) in the mobile fraction of Cav1 . Control and shPTRF ﬁbroblasts were transiently transfected with YFP - Cav1 . A 36 m m 2 area of the cell ( boxed in the second image ) was bleached to background levels , and images were then captured at 14 s intervals . The mean of normal - ized data ( ± SEM ) from ten independent FRAP experi - ments per cell type are plotted and the t d and R f derived from a one - phase exponential association ﬁt to the data . The half life ( t d ) for shCON was not signiﬁcantly different from shPTRF ( 74 s and 60 s , respectively ) . and caveolae in the notochord of the zebraﬁsh embryo ( Nixon et al . , 2007 ) . Formation of caveo - lae in the notochord occurs early in develop - ment , and notochord caveolae are highly abundant and easily quantiﬁed . Since gene expression can be readily ablated using mor - pholino ( MO ) technology at this stage of devel - opment , this offers a powerful in vivo system to study caveolae formation . The cDNA for the putative zebraﬁsh ptrf was cloned by PCR based on a predicted protein from Ensembl , transcript number GENSCAN00000026855 . The putative zebraﬁsh Ptrf protein is 50 % iden - tical and 62 % similar to human PTRF . The zebraﬁsh ptrf homolog was clearly detected within the no - tochord at 18 – 31 hr postfertilization by in situ hybridization ( Fig - ure 7 ) , overlapping with the expression of c av1 ( Fang et al . , 2006 ; Nixon et al . , 2007 ) . In addition , at later stages of development , expression of ptrf could be detected in blood vessels , branchial arches , and otic vesicles ( Figure 7C ) . ptrf expression was ﬁrst detected in the notochord of 18 hr embryos ( Figure 7F , G ) , with labeling absent in 16 hr embryos ( Figures 7D and 7E ) . This was of high interest as c av1 expression was detected as early as 12 hr ( Figure 7I ) ( Fang et al . , 2006 ; Nixon et al . , 2007 ) . The differ - ential expression of ptrf and c av1 transcripts in early zebraﬁsh embryos was conﬁrmed by RT - PCR ( Figure 7H ) , and we further conﬁrmed the expression of Cav1 protein by immunohistochem - istry in 16 hr embryos ( Figure 7J ) . Notochord ultrastructure from 120 Cell 132 , 113 – 124 , January 11 , 2008 ª 2008 Elsevier Inc . 16 hr and 24 hr embryos was examined by electron microscopy ( Figure S8 ) . In agreement with our previous data , morphological caveolae were not detectable at 16 hr , but was highly abundant at 24 hr , again supporting a role for PTRF in caveolae formation . To examine whether Ptrf is required for caveola formation in the zebraﬁsh , we performed Ptrf knockdown in zebraﬁsh em - bryos . Injection of PTRF - MO produced a curved phenotype in 42 % of the injected embryos ( Figures 7K and 7L ) , identical to the curved phenotype observed in Cav1 - MO zebraﬁsh embryos ( Nixon et al . , 2007 ) . Similar results were obtained using a splic - ing - blocking MO . Quantitation of caveolae density in the noto - chordof PTRF - MOandcontrol - MO zebraﬁsh showed adramatic reduction in caveolae upon Ptrf downregulation ( Figures 7M and 7N ) . Caveolae density correlated with the severity of phenotype ( mild 43 . 7 % ± 5 . 5 % of caveolae in the notochord of control MO - injected embryos ; severe 23 . 6 % ± 3 . 6 % of control ) . The level of caveolae reduction is comparable to that reported for Caveolin - MO ( Fang et al . , 2006 ; Nixon et al . , 2007 ) . We examined the local - ization of Cav1 in PTRF - MO embryos by immuno - EM ( Figures 7O – 7Q ) . In control - MO notochord , the plasma membranes be - tween two adjacent cells are tightly opposed and contain numer - ous Cav1 - decorated caveolae ( Figure 7O ) . In contrast , gaps can be observed between neighboring notochord cells in PTRF MO - injected embryos ( Figure 7N ) , and Cav1 labeling is mainly associated with ﬂat membrane ( Figures 7P and 7Q ) . These re - sults show that PTRF is required for caveola formation in vivo and that this role is conserved in evolution . DISCUSSION In this studywe have shown that PTRF , a protein initiallyidentiﬁed as a transcript release factor , is required for caveola formation in Figure 7 . PTRF Is Required for Caveola Formation in Zebraﬁsh Notochord Cells ( A – G ) Expression pattern of ptrf during zebraﬁsh development was analyzed by whole - mount mRNA in situ hybridization . Ante - rior is to the left and dorsal to the top . ptrf expression was detected in the notochord ( n ) in 24 hr embryos ( A ) and 31 hr em - bryos ( B ) . In 72 hr embryos ( C ) , expression was detected in dorsal blood vessels ( dbv ) , in the otic vesicle ( ov ) , and in the branchial arches ( ba ) . ptrf mRNA expression was ﬁrst detected in 18 hr embryos ( F and G ) , and it was not detected in 16 hr embryos ( D and E ) . ( H ) RT - PCR comparing the temporal mRNA expression pattern of ptrf and c av1 during early embryo development . ptrf mRNA ex - pression arose at 18 hr and was maintained throughout the devel - opment until 72 hr . c av1 mRNA expression was detected earlier than ptrf and was detected in the notochord as early as 12 hr by in situ hybridization ( I ) . Expression of Cav1 protein was observed in the notochord by immunohistochemistry of 16 hr embryos ( J ) . Arrowheads in ( A ) – ( J ) indicate the notochord . ( K and L ) Ptrf knockdown embryos were generated by morpho - lino ( MO ) injection ( 6 ng / embryo ) . At 48 hr , 79 % of control MO in - jected embryos appeared normal ( K ) , whereas 44 % of embryos injected with PTRF MO were curved under and / or presented heart edema ( L ) . ( M – Q ) Ultrastructural analysis and immunogold labeling of the no - tochord of 48 hr embryos injected with control MO ( M and O ) or PTRF MO ( N , P , and Q ) . In the regions of cell - cell contact , the plasma membranes ( PM ) of neighboring cells are closely ap - posed . The plasma membrane in these regions is covered in cav - eolae ( some of which are indicated by arrowheads ) in the control MO - injected embryos ( M ) . Caveolin immunogold labeling ( arrow - heads ) is associated with the invaginated caveolae as seen in frozen sections labeled in parallel ( O ) . The density of caveolae is greatly reduced in PTRF MO - injected embryos ( N ) , and the plasma membranes of neighboring cells are less closely ap - posed . Caveolin labeling is associated predominantly with ﬂat plasma membrane rather than invaginated caveolae in the PTRF MO - injected embryos ( P and Q ) . pm , plasma membrane .

PTRF - Cavin shows unique properties ; it associates with mature caveolae at the plasma membrane but does not associate with noncaveolar caveolin ( in the Golgi complex or with mutant forms of caveolin ) . This interaction is conserved in evolution ; mammalian PTRF - Cavin even associates with caveolae generated by expression ofinvertebratecaveolins . PTRF - Cavin , unlikecaveolin , isasoluble cytosolicproteinrecruitedtothemembranetogeneratecaveolae . TogetherwiththeabundanceofPTRF - Cavinincaveolae , thissug - gests that PTRF - Cavin operates as a coat protein for caveolae . The current model of caveolae biogenesis suggests that cav - eolae form at the Golgi complex in a process involving caveolin oligomerization and cholesterol binding and trafﬁc as a unit that fuses directly with the plasma membrane ( Tagawa et al . , 2005 ) . Once at the plasma membrane , caveolae are relatively im - mobile but can be endocytosed , to be recycled or fuse with the endosome or the caveosome ( Kirkham et al . , 2005 ; Pelkmans et al . , 2002 ; Thomsen et al . , 2002 ) . A unique feature of the caveo - lar domain , as illustrated in these studies , was the maintenance of the stable caveolar unit despite multiple rounds of endocytic transport . This is quite different to the assembly and disassembly of coat components of classical coated structures such as cla - thrin - coated vesicles . In agreement with this model , we did not detect a change in PTRF - Cavin / caveolin interaction upon stimu - lation of caveolae endocytosis ( data not shown ) . Individual cav - eolae were estimated to each contain 144 molecules of caveolin ( Pelkmans and Zerial , 2005 ) . PTRF - Cavin is also clearly an abun - dant component of caveolae as shown here and suggested in previous studies based on immunogold labeling density ( Vold - stedlund et al . , 2001 ) . High ectopic expression of caveolin results in association of caveolin with noncaveolar domains , where it shows higher lateral mobility ( Pelkmans and Zerial , 2005 ) . PTRF - Cavin may be one component that becomes limiting under these conditions , since downregulation of PTRF - Cavin causes a loss of caveolae but caveolin remains at the plasma membrane and associated with DRMs . The possibility that the caveolar unit can be disassembled , through dissociation of PTRF , to release caveolin and other sequestered components in the bulk mem - brane can now be examined . How does PTRF recognize and stabilize caveolae ? While we can show close association of caveolin and PTRF - Cavin , our in - ability to consistently detect their stable association using immu - noprecipitation techniques raises the possibility of an indirect role of caveolin and the potential involvement of membrane lipids . We have now shown binding of recombinant PTRF - Cavin with PS in vitro ( Figures 4D and 4E ) and a requirement for choles - terol for PTRF - Cavin / caveolin interaction ( Figure 4C ) . As the cav - eolin scaffolding domain has been proposed to oligomerize in vitro to form lateral membrane domains containing PS and cholesterol ( Wanaski et al . , 2003 ) , an intriguing possibility is that PTRF - Cavin binds caveolin - generated PS - cholesterol do - mains , thus stabilizing the membrane curvature of caveolae . This is consistent with the fact that even an invertebrate caveolin , with limited sequence conservation , when expressed in mam - maliancells , canrecruitPTRF - Cavin . Ourresultssuggestamodel where caveolae biogenesis would primarily involve caveolin - driven domain formation , but with PTRF - Cavin providing critical stability for the nascent caveolar structures . Whether the mech - anisms involved show any similarities to the generation of curva - ture in other systems , such as those driven by BAR domain proteins ( Dawson et al . , 2006 ) , will await further detailed investi - gation of the cooperation between caveolin and PTRF - Cavin , and a detailed understanding of the membrane lipid - protein in - teractions involved . Conclusions In this study , we have deﬁned PTRF - Cavin as an essential com - ponent ofcaveolae . We propose a newmodel ofcaveolae forma - tion and function in which PTRF - Cavin is recruited to membrane domains containing PS , cholesterol , and oligomerized caveolins . Binding of PTRF - Cavin to these domains stabilizes the mem - brane curvature to produce the classic ﬂask shape of caveolae . Loss of PTRF - Cavin releases caveolar components , including caveolins into the plasma membrane . The level of noncaveolar caveolins are tightly regulated via endolysosomal degradation . PTRF - Cavin is therefore a potential caveolar coat protein that regulates caveola structure and function . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Electron Microscopy and Quantitation Labeling of the cell surface by ruthenium red ﬁxation was performed as previ - ously described ( Parton et al . , 2002 ) . The percentage area of the cell surface occupied by caveolae was estimated by intersection counting as in previous studies ( Parton , 1994 ) , except that counting was performed on captured images ( Jeol1011TEMequippedwithMoradacooledCCDcameraandOlym - pusSoftImagingSolutions Gmbh , GermanywithAnalySISsoftware ) atamag - niﬁcation of 15 , 000 – 20 , 000 3 . Images were captured at random from different areas of the monolayer and overlayed with appropriate double - lattice grids to measure intersections with the plasma membrane ( 25 3 grid ) and with caveo - lae ( 1 3 grid ) deﬁned as 60 – 100 nm uncoated invaginations of the ruthenium red - labeled plasma membrane . Two independent ﬁelds from each of at least twoindependentexperimentswere quantitatedforeach condition , and similar resultswereobtainedindouble - blindexperimentsinwhichcodeswerebroken after quantitation . FRET imaging FRET was measured as sensitized acceptor emission using the three - cube method as previously described ( Erickson et al . , 2001 ) . Images in donor ( ex 405 nm , em 470 – 500 nm ) , acceptor ( ex 514 nm , em 530 – 600 nm ) and FRET ( ex 405 nm , em 530 – 600 nm ) channels were acquired on a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta using a 63 3 or 100 3 oil immersion objective , with numerical apertures of 1 . 4 . Living cells were imaged in PBS / 1 mM CaCl 2 . FLIM FLIM experiments were carried out using a lifetime ﬂuorescence imaging attachment ( Lambert Instruments , Leutingwolde , The Netherlands ) on an in - verted microscope ( Olympus IX71 ) . BHK cells transiently expressing mGFP - PTRF ( donor ) , aloneorwithmRFP - Cav3 ( acceptor ) ( usinga1 : 3ratioofplasmid DNA ) were excited using a sinusoidally modulated 3W 470 nm LED at 80 MHz under epi - illumination . Fluorescein was used as a lifetime reference standard . Cells were imaged with a 60 3 NA 1 . 45 oil objective using an appropriate GFP ﬁlter set . The phase and modulation were determined from a set of 12 phase settings using the manufacturer’s software . Resolution of two lifetimes in the frequency domain , pixel by pixel , was performed using the polar plot method ( Clayton et al . , 2004 ) again as implemented in the manufacturer’s software .
