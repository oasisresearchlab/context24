Likos Faculty of Physics , University of Vienna , Boltzmanngasse 5 , A - 1090 Vienna , Austria ( Dated : May 2 , 2014 ) Abstract A coarse - grained computational model is used to investigate the eﬀect of a ﬂuid membrane on patchy - particle assembly into biologically - relevant structures motivated by viral cores and clathrin . For cores , we demonstrate a non - monotonic dependence of the promotion of assembly on membrane stiﬀness . If the membrane is signiﬁcantly deformable , cores are enveloped in buds , although this eﬀect is suppressed for very ﬂexible membranes . In the less deformable regime , we observe no marked enhancement for cores , even for strong adhesion to the surface . For clarthrin - like particles , we again observe the formation of buds , whose morphology depends on membrane - ﬂexibility . 1 In self - assembly , the interactions between a collection of components guide them to spon - taneously form an ordered structure [ 1 ] . Biological self - organization happens within cells , from which all living organisms are composed . Cells are all bounded by a membrane , as are many sub - cellular structures . Thus many self - assembly processes are membrane - inﬂuenced . Membranes themselves are also self - assembled , primarily as a lipid bilayer [ 2 ] . We focus , however , on structures assembled only from proteinaeous sub - units , particularly viruses and clathrin . The genome of a virus is contained in a core or capsid , a typically mono - disperse shell , assembled from individual protein complexes . Often the shells are approximately spherical , with many having icosahedral symmetry [ 3 ] . Viruses are divided into enveloped and non - enveloped types , depending on whether the core is surrounded by a membrane . The envelope in the former group is acquired through budding [ 4 ] . For both enveloped [ 5 – 10 ] and non - enveloped [ 11 – 13 ] viruses there is abundant evidence of membrane inﬂuence on core assembly . Clathrin , on the other hand , is intrinsically linked to membranes : its main function is the formation of coated vesicles for intra - cellular protein transport [ 14 ] . Its three - legged shape allows a collection of individual units to form structures that range from extended hexagonal sheets to closed cages , which always include 12 pentagonal , in addition to diﬀerent numbers of hexagonal , faces [ 15 ] . Assembly is nucleated on cellular membranes by adaptors , protein complexes which bind the lattice to the membrane . Hexagonal sheets on membranes are observed [ 16 ] and coated vesicles form through budding [ 14 ] . Experimentally , the reversible disassembly and reassembly of viral capsids in solution may be triggered by raising and lowering the pH [ 17 ] , allowing in vitro experiments of bulk assembly , which is observed , for example , by light scattering [ 18 ] or electron microscopy [ 19 ] . Similar experiments with clathrin [ 20 ] observed bulk assembly into cage structures , ﬁnding them to be much more homogeneous when adaptor proteins are present . Much theoretical work on biological bulk self - assembly has used patchy - particle models . Patchy - particles have discrete , attractive interaction sites on their surface and are very ver - satile in terms of the range of structures that may be assembled [ 21 ] . The main focus has been on the assembly of mono - disperse viral capsids [ 22 – 26 ] , with simulations reproducing key characteristics such as a lag time , hysteresis and partial capsid formation at high con - centrations . Simulations also give more detailed , experimentally inaccessible information about assembly dynamics . A similar coarse - grained simulation approach was also applied 2 to clathrin assembly [ 27 , 28 ] . Previous applications of coarse - grained models to the eﬀect of membranes on self - assembly are limited , although the eﬀect of rigid templates has been considered [ 29 ] . Aggregation of isotropic spherical particles , on ﬂuid [ 30 ] , and polymerized [ 31 ] , membranes was studied . More detailed models were also applied to self - assembly within a lipid bilayer [ 32 , 33 ] . Although not considering assembly , simulations of particles attracted to a membrane also saw budding [ 34 ] . An alternative continuum approach found that self - assembly induced budding is controlled by interaction strengths and rigidity [ 35 ] . Given the evidence of the inﬂuence of membranes on the self - assembly of biological struc - tures , it is important to explore the generic physics that plays a role in such systems . Although biological detail is undoubtedly important , we choose rather to investigate coarse - grained models that share salient features with viral cores and clathrin . We focus on a range of interaction strengths that cover the crossover to assembly in the bulk , as well as that from unbound to membrane - bound structures . We correspondingly choose bending rigidities within a range whose lowest end gives membranes that are easily deformed , and whose highest end gives ones that may not be deformed , by the assembled structures . Here we focus on equilibrium , postponing dynamics to a later work . Our model comprises N SU assembling sub - units plus the membrane . The former are mod - eled as spherical patchy - particles with a Kern - Frenkel potential [ 21 ] , similarly to previous work [ 25 ] but modiﬁed suitably such that its ﬁrst derivative is continuous . The membrane is represented using a dynamically triangulated surface model [ 36 ] : N mem particles connected with 3 N mem bonds form a network of N tri = 2 N mem triangles . We sample using Monte Carlo ( MC ) simulations [ 37 ] , performed in a periodic rectangular box of sides L x , L y and L z . The membrane’s projection completely covers the box in the xy - plane , connecting to itself across the boundaries . To apply no external tension [ 38 ] we allow L x = L y to vary , whilst also adjusting L z to keep to volume , V = L x L y L z , ﬁxed . The MC moves used do not allow the membrane topology to change . Sub - units interact with the membrane from both sides but are only attracted to one side . Quantities are given in units of the thermal energy , k B T , or the typical length of a membrane bond , l . Interactions between sub - units ( ss ) and between sub - units and membrane particles ( ms ) are of a Lennard - Jones type ( see appendix ) . An orientational dependence of the attractive part creates patches . The parameter θ 0 deﬁnes the maximum angular deviation of the patch 3 position from the particle - to - particle vector before the attractive interaction decreases . It is chosen such that , for a given pair of sub - units , only one pair of ss patches can interact at once . For ss interactions , twisting of sub - units around an interacting patch is also penalized , mimicking the torsional constraints in protein - protein interactions [ 25 ] . The ss patches are evenly spaced around the particle , with the ms patch lying on the axis of rotational symmetry . The sub - units have a size of ≈ 2 . 5 and we choose θ 0 = π / 4 for the ms interactions . This gives a relatively wide ms patch , so that a sub - unit typically interacts with many membrane particles so seeing a smooth surface . The minima of the ss and ms interactions are − ǫ ss and − ǫ ms . A pair of sub - units are deﬁned to be bonded if their interaction energy is < − 0 . 25 ǫ ss . The bending stiﬀness of the membrane is set by λ b ≃ κ , the bending rigidity of the membrane ( see [ 36 ] and appendix ) . We choose two diﬀerent parameters sets . For our core model , N SU = 12 . Sub - units have ﬁve ss patches with θ 0 = 0 . 2 , giving a similar patch width to the optimum in Ref . [ 25 ] . If the twelve sub - units are placed on the vertices of an icosahedron , they may be aligned with the ms patches pointing outwards and every ss patch pointing directly at a patch on a neighboring sub - unit , bonding with it . Here , V = 1 . 07 × 10 4 and N mem = 576 . In our clathrin - like model N SU = 36 and sub - units have three ss patches each with θ 0 = 0 . 3 . The patches are wider to allow for a range of curvatures . Following Ref . [ 28 ] , the ss patches make an angle of ( 79 / 180 ) π to the ms patch so that , if a closed cage is formed , the ms patches point inwards . Here , V = 2 . 15 × 10 4 and N mem = 1156 . Membrane sizes were chosen , using preliminary runs , to give plenty of area to cover assembled structures , with the V chosen to allow large membrane deformations . Qualitative results were not sensitive to V . The main connection to biological systems is that the interactions drive our models to form similar structures . The core sub - units resemble intermediate capsomers in the assembly of a T = 1 capsid , the smallest virus structure with icosahedral symmetry [ 25 ] . In reality , enveloped viruses are larger . In our clathrin - like model sub - units are considered equivalent to one clathrin , with each patch representing a leg . This is a simpliﬁcation in that , in structure formation , multiple legs of diﬀerent clathrin lie along each other . We neglect adaptor proteins [ 14 ] . Eﬃcient sampling of our system must overcome a number of issues : free - energy barriers between assembled and disassembled states ; the importance of collective motion for mem - brane relaxation ; large times to ﬁnd target structures . MC allows us to combine diﬀerent ap - 4 proaches that address these problems , speciﬁcally Aggregate Volume Bias ( AVB ) moves [ 39 ] , Hybrid Monte Carlo ( HMC ) moves [ 40 ] and Multicanonical Parallel - Tempering ( MPT ) [ 41 ] . The AVB moves , which shift sub - units directly between non - bonded and bonded states , as well as displacing bonded clusters onto or oﬀ the membrane , allow target structures to be found very quickly . HMC , which uses molecular dynamics ( MD ) trajectories to create trial states , captures collective motion . Finally , the free - energy barrier problem is ameliorated through the use of MPT , involving parallel tempering swaps in two dimensions , ǫ ss and ǫ ms . The further addition of a one - dimensional biasing potential , w ( E ss / ǫ ss ) , constructed iteratively during initialization , increases the swap acceptance rate . E ss is the total interac - tion energy between all sub - units . We found that the HMC acceptance rate is signiﬁcantly improved by constructing w ( E ss / ǫ ss ) as a continuous diﬀerentiable function and including the resulting forces in the MD integration [ 42 ] . 5 5 . 2 5 . 4 5 . 6 5 . 86 6 . 2 6 . 4 6 . 6 6 . 87 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 ε ss [ k B T ] ε ms [ k B T ] 5 5 . 2 5 . 4 5 . 6 5 . 86 6 . 2 6 . 4 6 . 6 6 . 87 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 ε ss [ k B T ] ε ms [ k B T ] ( a ) ( b ) 5 5 . 2 5 . 4 5 . 6 5 . 86 6 . 2 6 . 4 6 . 6 6 . 87 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 ε ss [ k B T ] ε ms [ k B T ] 5 5 . 2 5 . 4 5 . 6 5 . 86 6 . 2 6 . 4 6 . 6 6 . 87 0 . 5 1 2 4 8 ε ss [ k B T ] λ b [ 3 1 / 2 k B T ] 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 P a ( c ) ( d ) FIG . 1 . Probability of ﬁnding a correctly assembled icosahedral core in a simulation with 12 sub - units as a function of ǫ ss and ǫ ms for diﬀerent λ b : ( a ) √ 3 / 2 ( b ) √ 3 ( c ) 8 √ 3 . Results for 2 √ 3 and 4 √ 3 are shown in the appendix . ( d ) As a function of ǫ ss and λ b for ǫ ms = 0 . 84 . We deﬁne a core to be assembled if all twelve sub - units are in a cluster and each makes ﬁve bonds . In Fig . 1 we plot the probability of ﬁnding an assembled core , P a , as a function 5 of ǫ ss and ǫ ms for a range of λ b between √ 3 / 2 and 8 √ 3 . Our chosen ǫ ss range covers the crossover from P a ≈ 0 to P a ≈ 1 for a bulk system with the same free assembly volume . For all λ b , we observe that , for the lowest ǫ ms , this crossover occurs at about the same ǫ ss as in the no - membrane system ( see appendix ) . For more deformable membranes , as ǫ ms is increased , assembly occurs at lower ǫ ss . This enhancement depends non - monotonically on λ b , see Fig . 1 ( d ) , occurring over a larger area of parameter space for λ b = √ 3 than for λ b = √ 3 / 2 , but then reducing and disappearing as λ b is increased further . For lower λ b , and high ǫ ms , the membrane tends to envelop the sub - units . In Fig . 2 , typical conﬁgurations observed for λ b = √ 3 / 2 and λ b = √ 3 with an assembled core attached to the membrane are shown . Interestingly , whilst for λ b = √ 3 this envelopment is almost complete , forming a bud , for λ b = √ 3 / 2 it is only partial . In Figs . 2 ( c ) and ( d ) we plot the average of the total membrane - sub - unit interaction energy , h E ms i , as a function of ǫ ss and ǫ ms for the same λ b , conﬁrming that for λ b = √ 3 / 2 the membrane envelops the sub - units less : for λ b = √ 3 the minimum of h E ms i is ≈ − 100 , whilst for λ b = √ 3 / 2 it is ≈ − 70 . The lowest h E ms i are strongly correlated with envelopment in buds . For λ b = 2 √ 3 , some conﬁgurations with similar envelopment as for λ b = √ 3 are seen but , for higher λ b only some deformation , not full envelopment , is seen ( see appendix ) . The lack of an enhancement of assembly in this regime , despite strong attractions to the membrane , is in contrast to the case of extended crystals , where structures grow near attractive walls even if the bulk is ﬂuid [ 43 ] . In the bulk , the probability of assembly is determined by whether the attractions are suﬃcient to overcome the associated entropy loss . The attraction of sub - units to the mem - brane conﬁnes them , reducing this entropy loss , which may promote assembly . If the free energy gain in forming the core is suﬃcient to overcome the bending energy , as well as the entropic cost of binding to the core , the assembled structure may form a bud . Budding is not necessary for assembly promotion but the membrane stiﬀness with the most budding also has the most promotion . The non - monotonic rigidity dependence may be due to budding suppression : for low stiﬀness by membrane entropy and for high stiﬀness by bending energy . For our cores , changing the membrane stiﬀness and attraction changes the probability of forming one speciﬁc structure . For isotropic particles , in contrast , altering these parameters may lead to qualitatively diﬀerent structures [ 30 , 31 ] . 6 Whilst our range of bending rigidities approximately overlaps with that expected for biological membranes ( ≈ 2 . 5 − 25 [ 44 ] ) , those where we see budding are somewhat on the lower side of this range ( λ b ≤ 2 √ 3 ) . This discrepancy may well arise from the coarse - grained nature of our model and particularly from the relatively small number of sub - units in our cores : assuming the free energy gain is proportional to the number of sub - units forming them , smaller structures will be less able to deform the membrane into a given shape .

Typical conﬁgurations for an assembled core strongly attracted to the membrane , taken from simulations with ǫ ss = 5 . 55 and ǫ ms = 1 for λ b : ( a ) √ 3 / 2 ( b ) √ 3 . Membrane particles are shown in green and sub - units in yellow . The positions ( not extents ) of the ss patches are shown in red and the ms patches in blue . The average total membrane - sub - unit interaction energy , h E ms i , as a function of ǫ ss and ǫ ms is plotted for the same λ b : ( c ) √ 3 / 2 ( d ) √ 3 . For the clathrin - like model , the structures formed are typically poly - disperse , see Fig . 3 , and we use a standard measure of asphericity , ∆ , to investigate their shape . ∆ ( see [ 45 ] and appendix ) takes values between 0 and 1 , with 1 corresponding to a shape with spherical symmetry and 0 corresponding to a non - spherical , oblate or prolate shape . We ﬁrst focus on the average of the number of sub - units in the largest bonded cluster , 7 ( a ) ( b ) ( c ) ( d ) FIG . 3 .

We consider the same range of ǫ ms as for the core model and choose the ǫ ss range so that for the no - membrane system it covers the crossover from small clusters of a few sub - units to most of the 36 sub - units being in one cluster ( see appendix ) . For higher ǫ ss , without a membrane , the sub - units are observed to form closed cages , see Fig . 3 ( a ) . We observe that the sub - unit bonds form 5 and 6 member closed rings on the cage surfaces but the shape of the “faces” they enclose deviate signiﬁcantly from pentagons or hexagons , being not generally ﬂat , and the cages , whilst qualitatively similar , are not generally of the form of the structures observed for clathrin [ 15 ] . The key diﬀerence may be that when two clathrin bond their legs lie along each other , which will result in a greater ﬂexibility to tilt the symmetry axes of the two clathrin than to rotate around the symmetry axes . In our clathrin - like model , however , a bond has equal ﬂexibility for both such deformations . In Fig . 4 ( a ) and ( b ) we plot h N max i as a function of ǫ ss and ǫ ms for λ b = √ 3 / 2 and 8 √ 3 . Looking at Fig . 4 ( a ) we see that , for the most ﬂexible membrane , there is a similar enhancement of assembly for higher ǫ ms as for cores . However , as shown in Fig . 4 ( b ) , in contrast to cores , the enhancement remains as λ b is increased .

Clathrin - like model : average number of sub - units in the largest cluster , h N max i , as a function of ǫ ss and ǫ ms for λ b : ( a ) √ 3 / 2 ( b ) 8 √ 3 . Average asphericity of the largest cluster , h ∆ i , as a function of ǫ ss and ǫ ms for λ b : ( c ) 2 √ 3 and ( d ) 8 √ 3 . λ b were very similar ( see appendix ) . This is due to the ability of the clathrin - like sub - units to form structures with a range of curvatures : as depicted in Fig . 3 ( b ) , at lower λ b the sub - units form roughly spherical structures which enclose membrane buds . Indeed , at λ b = √ 3 / 2 , these are often nearly closed , with the membrane in the bud connected to the rest by a very narrow neck ( see appendix ) . At intermediate λ b , we observe the formation of more open , curved structures , or pits , on the membrane , see Fig . 3 ( c ) , whereas at high λ b the sub - units form extended , approximately ﬂat structures lying on the membrane surface , as shown in Fig . 3 ( d ) . In Fig . 4 ( c ) and ( d ) we plot the average of the asphericity of the largest sub - unit cluster , h ∆ i , for λ b = 2 √ 3 and 8 √ 3 . For low ǫ ms and higher ǫ ss there is a region for all λ b where h ∆ i ≈ 0 , corresponding to closed cage structures , not attached to the membrane . For higher ǫ ms , non - closed structures bound to the membrane are formed . At lower λ b these remain somewhat spherical , whilst for λ b = 8 √ 3 they are a lot less so . To summarize , we described a simple coarse - grained model to simulate the eﬀect of a 9 membrane on the assembly of proteinaceous sub - units . We used this model to investigate the assembly of structures that share key features with viral cores and clathrin . In both cases we found that attraction to the membrane may enhance assembly in regions without bulk assembly . For cores , this eﬀect shows an interesting non - monotonic dependence on membrane rigidity , being reduced for very deformable membranes and disappearing for the stiﬀest , in contrast to extended crystalline structures with attractive walls . For clathrin - like particles , the promotion of assembly persists for less deformable membranes . The diﬀerence to cores is due to the ability of clathrin - like particles to form structures with diﬀerent curvatures . Furthermore , we observed the formation of biologically relevant buds for both cores and clathrin - like particles . In the case of cores , we found that these do not occur if the membrane is very ﬂexible , whilst for clathrin - like particles their morphology depends on membrane - ﬂexibility . The formation of buds on membranes is crucial in various biological processes , for exam - ple endocytosis , in which , in some organisms , clathrin plays an important role . Endocytosis is a complex process involving the collaborative binding of variety of proteins to the mem - brane [ 46 ] . The demonstration of bud - formation through assembly in our simulations opens the possibility that simple , patchy - particle models could capture basic features of such pro - cesses , giving new insight . The eﬀects described might also be experimentally observed by mixing patchy colloids [ 47 , 48 ] with giant vesicles [ 49 , 50 ] , whose bending rigidity [ 51 ] lies well within the range considered . More generally , our results clearly demonstrate that membranes can have a profound impact on self - assembly and will hopefully stimulate fur - ther study in this direction . In future it will be interesting to investigate the dynamics of membrane - inﬂuenced assembly . This work was supported by the Austrian Science Fund ( FWF ) : M1367 .

Parameters and variables are as deﬁned in the main text . Model Details For the interactions between membrane particles we use smooth potentials that are also appropriate for molecular dynamics [ 53 ] . Bonded membrane particles interact via U bond ( r ij ) =   0 for r ij ≤ 1 . 15 l , ( 80 k B T ) exp [ 1 / ( 1 . 15 l − r ij ) ] / ( 1 . 33 l − r ij ) for 1 . 15 l < r ij < 1 . 33 l , ∞ for r ij ≥ 1 . 33 l , ( 1 ) with r ij = | r ij | = | r j − r i | , where r i is position of particle i . All pairs of membrane particles experience an excluded volume potential U EV ( r ij ) =   ∞ for r ij ≤ 0 . 67 l , ( 80 k B T ) exp [ 1 / ( r ij − 0 . 85 l ) ] / ( r ij − 0 . 67 l ) for 0 . 67 l < r ij < 0 . 85 l , 0 for r ij ≥ 0 . 85 l . ( 2 ) The minimum distance between any two membrane particles is 0 . 67 l and the maximum bond length is 1 . 33 l . A unit normal vector is associated with each membrane triangle . Each bond forms the side of two diﬀerent neighboring triangles . Membrane ﬂuidity is included using MC moves that attempt to remove a given bond and create a new one between the two vertices of its neighboring triangles that were not connected by the original . During this procedure 13 the direction of the normals is always maintained such that if the membrane were in a ﬂat conﬁguration all normals would point in the + z - direction . The bending stiﬀness of the membrane is controlled by including a potential U bend = λ b ( 1 − n i · n j ) for each bond , where n i and n j are the unit normal vectors of the two triangles neighboring the bond and λ b is an energy . This form for the bending energy has the weakness that the eﬀective bending rigidity is shape dependent . We have also performed simulations using an alternative that does not share this deﬁciency [ 36 ] . We observed qualitatively similar results but found simulation times were typically increased by about a factor of two . The total membrane area , A , is constrained with a harmonic potential , U area = ( k B T ) ( A − A 0 ) 2 , where A 0 = ( √ 3 / 4 ) l 2 N tri , in the Hamiltonian . For the case where particles i and j ( i 6 = j ) are both sub - units ( ss ) or where one is a sub - unit and one a membrane particle ( ms ) the interaction is of the following form , U ij = γ area [ U WCA ( r ij ) + γ side γ orient U att ( r ij ) ] U WCA ( r ) =   4 ǫ h(cid:0) σr (cid:1) 12 − (cid:0) σr (cid:1) 6 + 14 i for r < r t , 0 for r ≥ r t , U att ( r ) =   − ǫ for r < r t , 4 ǫ h(cid:0) σr (cid:1) 12 − (cid:0) σr (cid:1) 6 i for r t ≤ r ≤ r s , a ( r − r c ) 2 + b ( r − r c ) 3 for r s ≤ r ≤ r c , 0 for r ≥ r c , ( 3 ) where r t = 2 1 / 6 σ , r s = ( 26 7 ) 1 / 6 σ , r c = 6748 r s , a = − 241923211 ǫr 2 s and b = − 38707261009 ǫr 3 s . The form of U att ( r ) in the range r s ≤ r ≤ r c is a polynomial interpolation used to avoid a jump in the potential or its ﬁrst derivative at the cut - oﬀ [ 54 ] . The dimensionless factors γ area , γ side and γ orient take diﬀerent forms for ss and ms interactions . For all simulations reported , we set 14 the length scale , σ , for ss interactions to σ ss = 2 . 5 l and similarly set σ ms = ( 1 / 2 ) ( σ ss + l ) . The corresponding energy scales , ǫ , denoted ǫ ss and ǫ ms are varied . Since the membrane bonds have a relatively broad , ﬂat minimum the membrane particles would tend to be locally compressed when an attractive sub - unit is close . For ms interactions the γ area factor is used to counter - act this by making the interaction proportional to the area that the membrane particle represents : γ area = A neigh / ( N neigh A tri ) , where N neigh is the total number of triangles that have the membrane particle as a vertex , A neigh is their total area and A tri = A 0 / N tri . For ms interactions γ side is used to make only one side of the membrane attract sub - units : it takes a value of 1 if the sub - unit is “above” the membrane and 0 if it is “below” . A sub - unit is determined to be “above” or “below” by ﬁnding the closest point on the membrane in the z - direction . If the normal of the triangle enclosing the closest point makes an angle of less than π / 2 with the vector from the closest point to sub - unit then the sub - unit is “above” the membrane , otherwise it is “below” . For ss interactions γ area = γ side = 1 . The centres of the attractive patches are deﬁned by unit vectors . The width of the patches is determined by γ orient , which is a product of functions of the form [ 55 ] : F ( φ ; φ 0 , φ 1 ) =   1 for φ ≤ φ 0 , cos 2 [ ( π / 2 ) ( φ − φ 0 ) / φ 1 ] for φ 0 ≤ φ ≤ φ 0 + φ 1 , 0 for φ ≥ φ 0 + φ 1 . ( 4 ) For ss interactions , γ orient = γ orient ( ˆ r ij , Ω i , Ω j ) = F ( θ i ; θ 0 , θ 1 ) F ( θ j ; θ 0 , θ 1 ) F ( ψ ij ; 2 θ 0 , 2 θ 1 ) , where Ω describes particle orientation . θ i is the angle between the interacting patch on particle i and ˆ r ij , whilst θ j is between the patch of particle j and − ˆ r ij . ψ ij is the angle between the projections of the membrane patches of i and j onto the plane perpendicular to ˆ r ij . The factor F ( ψ ij ) penalizes the twisting of interacting sub - units . We follow ref . [ 25 ] in choosing the range for this factor to be double that for the other ones . For ms interactions , γ orient = γ orient ( ˆ r sm , Ω s ) = F ( θ s ; θ 0 , θ 1 ) , where ˆ r sm is the unit vector from the sub - unit to the membrane particle , Ω s describes the orientation of the sub - unit and θ s is the angle between the membrane patch and ˆ r sm . We choose θ 1 = 0 . 2 for all interactions . 15 To investigate the shape of assembled structures we employ the asphericity [ 45 ] : ∆ = 3 2tr ˆQ 2 / ( tr Q ) 2 ( 0 ≤ ∆ ≤ 1 ) , ( 5 ) where Q is a 3 × 3 tensor whose elements are given by Q αβ = 1 N X i r i , α r i , β − 1 N 2 X i r i , α X j r j , β , ( 6 ) where the sums are over all the N particles in the structure considered and r i , α is one of the three cartesian components of the position of particle i . ˆQ is a traceless counterpart of Q deﬁned as ˆQ = Q − ¯ λ I , where ¯ λ is the average of the three eigenvalues of Q . 16 Additional Results 5 5 . 2 5 . 4 5 . 6 5 . 86 6 . 2 6 . 4 6 . 6 6 . 87 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 ε ss [ k B T ] ε ms [ k B T ] 5 5 . 2 5 . 4 5 . 6 5 . 86 6 . 2 6 . 4 6 . 6 6 . 87 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 ε ss [ k B T ] ε ms [ k B T ] 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 P a ss e m b ( a ) ( b ) ( c ) FIG . 5 .
