Saurin 2 & Jonathan M . G . Higgins 1 SiR - Hoechst ( SiR - DNA ) is a far - red fluorescent DNA probe being used widely for time - lapse imaging of living cells that is reported to be minimally toxic at concentrations as high as 10 – 25 µ M . However , measuring nuclear import of Cyclin B1 , inhibition of mitotic entry , and the induction of γ H2AX foci in cultured human cells reveals that SiR - Hoechst induces DNA damage responses and G2 arrest at concentrations well below 1 µ M . SiR - Hoechst is useful for live cell imaging , but it should be used with caution and at the lowest practicable concentration . The ability to observe chromatin in living cells is invaluable in cell biology , allowing individual cells to be followed within cultures or tissues , and the fate of chromosomes within cells to be tracked ( for example during cell division or apoptosis ) . Cell permeable fluorescent DNA dyes that allow chromatin to be visualized in many cell types with - out the need for introducing exogenous fluorescent proteins by transfection are therefore appealing . However , DNA dyes such as Hoechst 33342 are known to cause DNA damage , particularly during DNA replication , and so alter the behaviour of the cells under observation . Such damage may be brought about by disruption of cellular processes because of binding of the dye to DNA , by photochemical toxicity caused by excitation of the fluorescent molecule , or by a combination of the two 1 – 3 . A recently developed cell - permeable DNA probe , SiR - Hoechst ( also known as SiR - DNA ) 4 , is reported not to cause toxicity and has been commercialized , widely publicized , and adopted by numerous laboratories for live cell imaging 5 – 37 . SiR - Hoechst has some clear advantages : it is selective for DNA ; its fluorescence is enhanced upon DNA binding ; it is excited by far - red light , avoiding damage caused by the UV light required for traditional Hoechst dyes ; and it is compatible with live - cell super - resolution micros - copy . However , although in the original report there was little detectable effect on mitotic progression ( over 3 . 4 h ) or proliferation of transformed HeLa cells ( over 24 h ) , no detailed analyses of cell cycle progression or specific measurements of DNA damage were carried out in either transformed or in non - transformed cell lines 4 . Results and Discussion During a normal cell cycle , Cyclin B1 accumulates in the cytoplasm and at centrosomes during G2 , enters the nucleus several minutes before nuclear envelope breakdown at the onset of mitosis , and then is degraded during mitotic exit 38 , 39 . In transformed cell lines such as U2OS , DNA damage prevents the nuclear import of Cyclin B1 and cells arrest in G2 with high levels of cytoplasmic Cyclin B1 40 – 42 . By contrast , in non - transformed cell lines such as hTert - immortalized RPE1 , Cyclin B1 is imported into the nucleus in a p21 - dependent manner during G2 in response to DNA damage , and accumulation of Cyclin B1 at centrosomes remains low 41 – 45 . Hours later , Cyclin B1 is degraded in the absence of mitosis , and the cells become senescent 41 , 42 , 45 . To track Cyclin B1 localisation in response to SiR - Hoechst , we used RPE1 and U2OS cell lines that express Cyclin B1 - EYFP from its endogenous locus 46 , 47 . We treated RPE1 and U2OS cells with a range of SiR - Hoechst concentrations 4 , and observed the localisation of both Cyclin B1 - EYFP and SiR - Hoechst by live imaging for 18 to 19 h . In RPE1 cells we observed two major cell fates : ( i ) timely Cyclin B1 import prior to mitosis , and ( ii ) Cyclin B1 import followed by later degradation in the absence of mitosis , reflecting arrest in G2 ( Fig . 1a ) . Among control cells treated with DMSO that imported Cyclin B1 into the nucleus , 3 % displayed non - mitotic import of Cyclin B1 ( see example Supplemental Movie 1 ) , but this was significantly increased to 24 % in cells treated with 1 µ M SiR - Hoechst ( Supplemental Movie 2 , Fig . 1c ) . An increase in the percentage of RPE1 cells showing non - mitotic import of Cyclin B1 was also seen at 0 . 5 µ M and 0 . 25 µ M SiR - Hoechst , though the magnitude of this 1 Cell Division Biology Group , Institute for Cell and Molecular Biosciences , Newcastle University , Medical School , Framlington Place , Newcastle upon Tyne , NE2 4HH , UK . 2 Division of Cancer Research , School of Medicine , Jacqui Wood Cancer Centre , Ninewells Hospital and Medical School , University of Dundee , Dundee , DD1 9SY , UK .

As expected , the trans - formed cell line U2OS did not display non - mitotic nuclear import of Cyclin B1 , in either controls or after treat - ment with 1 µ M SiR - Hoechst , but Cyclin B1 accumulated in the cytoplasm over longer periods in the presence of SiR - Hoechst ( Fig . 1b , c ; Supplemental Movies 5 and 6 ) . Therefore , both RPE1 and U2OS cells show evidence of an arrest or delay in G2 in response to SiR - Hoechst . Figure 1 . Live imaging in the presence of SiR - Hoechst causes nuclear retention of Cyclin B1 in RPE1 cells , independent of mitosis . ( a ) Asynchronous RPE1 cells expressing Cyclin B1 - EYFP were treated with DMSO or different concentrations ( 1 µ M , 0 . 5 µ M , 0 . 25 µ M ) of SiR - Hoechst for 2 h prior to live imaging for 18 – 19 h in the continued presence of DMSO or SiR - Hoechst .

Statistical significance was determined using unpaired t - tests . www . nature . com / scientificreports / 3 SCIeNtIfIC REPORTS | ( 2018 ) 8 : 7898 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41598 - 018 - 26307 - 6 As an alternative way to monitor cell cycle delay in both RPE1 and U2OS cells , we counted the number of cells entering mitosis during live imaging . The presence of 1 µ M SiR - Hoechst caused the number of RPE1 and U2OS cells entering mitosis to drop by more than 40 % over the period of imaging ( Fig . 2a , b ) . This outcome was concentration - dependent , but declines in mitotic entry were also observed at 0 . 5 and 0 . 25 µ M SiR - Hoechst ( Fig . 2c ) . To estimate the extent of the delay , we developed a simple mathematical model of cell cycle progression in which SiR - Hoechst caused DNA damage in S phase , leading to either cell cycle arrest or delay in S / G2 . For RPE1 , cells arrest - ing in G2 were defined as those that imported Cyclin B1 in the absence of mitosis during live imaging ( approximately 10 % of all cells at 1 µ M SiR - Hoechst ) . The rates of mitotic entry observed at 0 . 25 , 0 . 5 and 1 µ M SiR - Hoechst were best modelled when the remaining non - arresting cells were delayed in S / G2 for an average of 8 , 14 or 26 hours , respec - tively ( Fig . 2c ; Supplemental Fig . 1a ) . For U2OS cells , which do not import Cyclin B1 into the nucleus in response to DNA damage , the model suggested that S / G2 was extended by an average of 33 h at 1 µ M SiR - Hoechst ( Supplemental Fig . 1b ) . In both the results and the models , the effect of SiR - Hoechst was most pronounced after 4 h or more of live imaging ( Fig . 2a – c ; Supplemental Fig . 1 ) , reflecting the ability of cells that are already in G2 when SiR - Hoechst is added to proceed relatively unimpeded into mitosis . Reducing the intensity of laser illumination during imaging did not prevent the detrimental effect of SiR - Hoechst on RPE1 cells ( Supplemental Fig . 2 ) . Although cells in mitosis itself have sometimes been considered particularly sensitive to damage during live imaging 4 , 48 , for those cells that divided , SiR - Hoechst had little influence on the duration of mitosis in either RPE1 or U2OS cells ( Fig . 2d , e ) . These findings show that , during live imaging , SiR - Hoechst can prevent a significant portion of cells from entering mitosis , and suggest that it induces a DNA damage response that delays or arrests cell cycle progression in G2 . In addition , they demonstrate that normal mitotic duration cannot be taken as evidence that cells are unaffected by the dye . To determine if this effect of SiR - Hoechst on living RPE1 cells requires light exposure during microscopy , we conducted experiments in which cells were treated with SiR - Hoechst for 20 h in the absence of imaging , followed by fixation and immunofluorescence microscopy . Among cells that had nuclear Cyclin B1 , we then determined the proportion that was in G2 or mitosis . Cells with uncondensed chromatin and nuclear but not centrosomal Cyclin B1 , and typically with nuclear p21 , were classified as in G2 . Cells with nuclear Cyclin B1 and Figure 2 . Live imaging in the presence of SiR - Hoechst delays cell division but does not alter the duration of mitosis .

Between 227 and 544 mitotic cells were quantified per treatment ( n = 3 ) . www . nature . com / scientificreports / 4 SCIeNtIfIC REPORTS | ( 2018 ) 8 : 7898 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41598 - 018 - 26307 - 6 clearly condensing chromosomes and / or centrosomal Cyclin B1 , typically without nuclear p21 , were classified as in mitosis ( see Fig . 3a , b ) . Among control DMSO - treated cells with nuclear Cyclin B1 , 5 % were in G2 , while the majority ( 95 % ) were in prophase of mitosis ( Fig . 3c ) . When treated with the known DNA damaging agent Doxorubicin , the majority ( 92 % ) of cells with nuclear Cyclin B1 were in G2 . Notably , 1 µ M SiR - DNA treatment also caused a significant increase , to 27 % , in the percentage of cells with nuclear Cyclin B1 that were in G2 ( Fig . 3c ) . These data show that binding of SiR - Hoechst to DNA is sufficient to cause nuclear Cyclin B1 retention in G2 in the absence of imaging , although laser exposure may exacerbate the effect ( see Supplemental Fig . 2 ) . Finally , we measured the induction of the DNA damage marker γ H2AX ( H2AX S139ph ) to determine if SiR - Hoechst caused DNA damage in cells . As expected , Doxorubicin strongly induced γ H2AX in both RPE1 and U2OS cell lines ( Fig . 4a , b ) . At 1 µ M , SiR - Hoechst caused a small increase in γ H2AX foci in both RPE1 and U2OS cells and , at 5 µ M , more clearly induced γ H2AX foci ( Fig . 4a , b ) particularly in RPE1 cells . Therefore , SiR - Hoechst may cause DNA damage even in the absence of imaging . By the measures of non - mitotic nuclear import of Cyclin B1 , inhibition of mitotic entry and the induction of γ H2AX foci , it is clear that SiR - Hoechst causes changes in cell cycle progression , probably at least in part due to DNA damage . U2OS cells , as well as the widely - used non - transformed cell line RPE1 , are susceptible to a sub - stantial G2 delay or arrest , even well below the manufacturer’s recommended concentration of 1 µ M . A majority of published studies use SiR - Hoechst at a concentration of 0 . 5 µ M or higher ( Supplemental Table 1 ) , but we find that it is not a benign DNA stain in living cells . Our results show that concentrations below 0 . 25 µ M should be used to minimize cell cycle progression defects . These concentrations are sufficient for high - quality imaging , at least by laser scanning confocal microscopy . Importantly , because the duration of mitosis can be unaffected under conditions in which the rate of mitotic entry is substantially reduced , apparently normal chromosome congres - sion and segregation cannot be taken as evidence that SiR - Hoechst is not altering the biology of the cells under observation . We hope that the observations and simple mathematical model reported here will help others to optimize suitable conditions for their own experiments . SiR - Hoechst is an excellent addition to the cell biologist’s toolbox , but we urge researchers to use it at the lowest possible concentration . Figure 3 .

Two hours before imaging , cells were loaded with SiR - Hoechst ( SiR - DNA ; Spirochrome ) or vehicle control ( DMSO ) . In addition , U2OS cells were treated with 10 µ M Verapamil ( Spirochrome ) to inhibit dye efflux pathways and enable homogenous DNA staining 4 .

Confocal pinholes were set to capture approximately 2 µ m thick optical sections for each channel . Sections were taken every 5 µ m over 20 µ m ( 5 sections in total ) . Volumes were captured approximately every 8 minutes . Channel observation conditions were as follows . For EYFP : excitation wavelength 514 nm ; laser power recorded at object of 47 µ W ; GaSaP detector gain of 43 / 255 . For SiR - Hoechst : excitation wavelength 640 nm ; laser power recorded at object of 190 µ W ; standard PMT detector gain of 81 / 255 . Where stated , alternative settings for SiR - Hoechst were used : excitation wavelength 640 nm ; laser power recorded at object of 86 µ W ; standard PMT detector gain of 81 / 255 . Power measurements were made in the same imaging conditions using a Thorlabs S170c microscope slide photodiode sensor and PM100D meter . All images were manually analysed and quantified using NIS - Elements ( Nikon ) software . The time of mitotic entry was deter - mined as the first movie frame in which Cyclin B1 - EYFP rapidly entered the nucleus prior to cell division visual - ised by transmitted light imaging . The duration of mitosis was defined as the time elapsed between this frame and the first frame in which Cyclin B1 - EYFP was eliminated in anaphase . Statistical analyses were carried out using Prism 7 ( GraphPad Software ) . Cell Cycle Model . To model the effect of SiR - Hoechst on the cell cycle , we assumed that dye - induced DNA damage is caused during DNA replication ( S phase ) and that this results in cell cycle arrest or delay in S or G2 phases . In the model , cells that are in G2 or mitosis at the time of SiR - Hoechst addition can proceed unimpeded into and through mitosis ( first term in the equation below ) . Cells that pass through S phase during imaging can have one of three fates . Two populations suffer delays in S / G2 of t x or t y hours ( where t x or t y ≥ 0 , and t x or t y = ∞ when arrested ) , represented by the second and third terms in the equation . Another population is unaffected by SiR - Hoechst ( final term in equation ) . Other parameters are as follows : t c is the normal duration of one cell cycle ( determined using imaging conditions in which % mitotic entry increased linearly for the entire duration of imaging ) ; t G2M is the normal length of time spent in G2 and M phases ( obtained from the literature ) 46 , 49 ; t p is the time in hours during which SiR - Hoechst was pre - incubated with cells prior to imaging ; t i is the number of hours since imaging began ; c is a coefficient accounting for progressive damage caused by imaging in the absence of SiR - Hoechst ; x and y are the fractions of cells suffering a delay of t x and t y hours , respectively ( where x + y ≤ 1 ) . = − + − − + + + − − + + + − − − − + cells entering mitosis min max t t t t x t max t t t t ct y t max t t t t ct x y t max t t t ct % 100 ( ( ( , 0 ) , ) ) 100 ( ( , 0 ) , 0 ) 100 ( ( , 0 ) , 0 ) 100 ( 1 ) ( ( , 0 ) , 0 ) G M p i c i G M p c x i i G M p c y i i G M p c i 2 2 2 2 Immunofluorescence microscopy . Cells were seeded on glass coverslips coated with poly - lysine and , after 24 h , treated with SiR - Hoechst ( SiR - DNA ; Spirochrome ) , doxorubicin hydrochloride ( Sigma ) or DMSO for 20 h before fixation with 2 % ( w / v ) paraformaldehyde ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) in PBS for 10 minutes at room temperature . After washing three times with PBS , cells were incubated in 0 . 5 % ( v / v ) Triton X - 100 in PBS for 10 minutes , washed three times with PBS and blocked in BlockAid solution ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) for 1 h at room temperature . Cells were stained for 18 h at 4 °C with the following primary antibodies diluted in BlockAid solution : mouse anti - GFP monoclonal antibody ( Abcam , ab1218 ) , mouse anti - phospho - Histone H2AX Ser - 139 ( γ H2AX ) monoclonal antibody ( Merck Millipore , 05 – 636 ) , rabbit anti - p21 polyclonal antibody ( Abcam , ab109520 ) . After washing three times with 0 . 05 % ( v / v ) Triton X - 100 in PBS , cells were stained with the follow - ing secondary antibodies diluted in BlockAid solution for 1 h at 37 °C : goat anti - rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 594 , donkey anti - mouse Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 594 ( Jackson ImmunoResearch ) . After washing , cells were stained with 2 µ g / ml Hoechst 33342 ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , H2570 ) in PBS for 5 min at room tem - perature , before washing with PBS and mounting using Prolong Diamond Antifade Mountant ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , P36961 ) . Images were obtained using a Zeiss Axio Imager , equipped with Apotome , 20x 0 . 8 NA air objective , LED light source , AxioCam MR R3 camera and ZEN ( Zeiss ) software . To obtain γ H2AX / DNA signals , images of approximately 18 fields per treatment in each experiment on a coverslip were captured . DNA and γ H2AX signals were quantified using Photoshop CS6 by determining the number of pixels within each image exceeding a fixed threshold intensity for γ H2AX signal ( “fuzziness” level 80 ) and DNA signal ( level 40 ) . The signal was then expressed as a ratio of the area containing γ H2AX staining over the area containing DNA signal . The signal intensity of nuclear p21 was quantified in G2 and prophase cells using ImageJ . Statistical analyses were carried out using Minitab 17 ( Minitab Inc . ) and Prism 7 ( GraphPad Software ) .
