PI - 3 kinase is one of the central nodes for distributing growth and proliferation signals downstream from growth factor receptors to the nucleus . Although PI - 3 kinase function has been associated with actin cytoskeleton remodeling , satisfactory explana - tions of the mechanisms mediating this regulation have been elusive . Here we propose that interac - tion of the Abi1 protein with the p85 regulatory subunit of PI - 3 kinase represents the link between growth receptor signaling and actin cytoskeleton remodeling . This function of Abi1 , which involves WAVE complex , was initially observed in macropinocytosis , and may explain the coincident dysreg - ulation of PI - 3 kinase and actin cytoskeleton in cancer .

Introduction Dysregulation of the actin cytoskeleton is associated with virtu - ally all stages of human cancer regardless of origin [ 1 ] . The acqui - sition of speciﬁc knowledge of molecular mechanisms underlying human cancer is key to devising speciﬁc diagnostic and treatment strategies [ 2 ] . Delineation of precise mechanisms and of key molecular players thus provides a rationale for future personalized treatment of individuals [ 3 ] . Among current advances , consider - able promise for anti - cancer treatment is offered by PI - 3 kinase inhibitors [ 4 , 5 ] . Anti - proliferative effects of PI - 3 kinase inhibitors have been associated with effects on actin cytoskeleton , suggesting that the cytoskeleton might be the important target for the thera - peutic effects of PI - 3 kinase inhibitors in proposed therapies [ 5 ] . Although functional connections between actin cytoskeleton and PI - 3 kinase - dependent proliferation have been established , our lack of knowledge of the mechanism makes it hard to explain or therapeutically exploit this phenomenon . Nonetheless , recent ﬁnd - ings suggest that the regulation involves interaction of PI - 3 kinase with WAVE complex ( Fig . 1A ) , the major actin cytoskeleton regula - tory complex , through its critical component , Abi1 [ 6 ] ( Fig . 1B ) . 2 . Regulation of WAVE complex and PI - 3 kinase WAVE complexes are the major actin nucleation - promoting fac - tors that regulate actin polymerization . In cells , WAVE complexes consist of associations of ubiquitously expressed variants of 5 poly - peptides : Abl interactor - 1 ( Abi1 , Hssh3bp1 ) , Rac1 - associated pro - tein 1 ( Sra - 1 ) , Nck - associated protein 1 ( Nap1 ) , and WAVE2 , as well as a 9 kDa - peptide called Brck - 1 or HSPC300 [ 7 – 9 ] ( Fig 1B ) . Except for Brck - 1 , which is a single copy gene , each of these pro - teins is member of a protein family consisting of two or three genes in mammals including alternatively spliced isoforms of some genes [ 10 ] : Sra - 1 and PIR121 ( also known as Cyﬁp1 and Cyﬁp2 ) , Nap1 and Hem1 , Abi1 , Abi2 , and Abi3 ( also called NESH ) , and WAVE1 , WAVE2 , and WAVE3 . Most of the isoforms have been shown to assemble into WAVE - complexes in comparable fashion [ 11 ] . WAVE complex has been implicated in membrane rufﬂing , but there is contradictory evidence as to which complexes regulate peripheral ( lamellipodia ) vs . dorsal rufﬂing [ 12 , 13 ] . WAVE complexes are also involved in cell motility and migration , cellular adhesion , cell - to - cell communication , cell division [ 9 , 14 – 17 ] , and participate in immunological responses [ 18 ] . Thus , WAVE complexes are in - volved in numerous processes requiring major actin cytoskeleton reorganization and dynamics [ 19 ] . Importantly , dysregulation of WAVE complex or its components is associated with human cancer [ 20 – 25 ] . The critical role of Abi1 in dorsal rufﬂing identiﬁes Abi1 as a major regulatory protein in macropinocytosis .

FEBSLetters . org is an actin cytoskeleton - dependent process characterized by exten - sive plasma membrane reorganization involving membrane ruf - ﬂing followed by formation of an extended and polymerized actin - rich structure , which is subsequently enclosed and internal - ized as a macropinosome . Macropinocytosis is involved in nutrient uptake [ 26 ] ; It is normally upregulated following growth factor and mitogenic agent stimulation [ 27 – 29 ] and pathologically upregulated in cancer cell lines [ 30 – 37 ] . Fibroblasts lacking Abi1 have a signiﬁcant defect in dorsal rufﬂing and have downregulated WAVE2 and WAVE1 complexes , but have upregulated Abi2 and WAVE3 [ 38 ] . Dysregulation of WAVE complexes or its components has been associated with invasiveness in prostate cancer [ 39 , 40 ] , breast cancer [ 21 ] , and epithelial tumorigenesis in general [ 22 , 23 ] . Recycling of integrins through PDGF - regulated dorsal ruf - ﬂes [ 41 ] , which likely occurs through direct binding of Abi1 to al - pha 4 integrin , as deﬁned in cells from the conventional Abi1 KO mouse [ 42 ] , links regulation of macropinocytosis to directional cel - lular migration and cellular adhesion , and thus , to processes that have been signiﬁcantly implicated in cancer tumorigenesis and progression . PI - 3 kinase is dysregulated in human cancer , and its dysregula - tion contributes to tumor progression . Thus , it is important to understand the mechanism of its regulation [ 43 , 44 ] . PI - 3 kinases can be divided into two subclasses , class IA PI - 3 kinases and class IB PI - 3 kinases . Class IA PI - 3 kinases are activated by receptor tyro - sine kinases , whereas class IB PI - 3 kinases are activated by G - pro - tein - coupled receptors [ 45 ] . Here , we are concerned with class IA PI - 3 kinases . Recent studies have shed considerable light on the regulation of class IA PI - 3 kinase activity [ 46 ] . PI - 3 kinase activity is regulated by autoinhibitory interactions between its subunits , p110 and p85 [ 47 ] . The catalytic activity is mediated by p110 , p85 is the regulatory subunit . Structural studies have conﬁrmed earlier functional observations that identiﬁed inhibitory interac - tions between catalytic p110 and regulatory p85 subunits [ 48 ] . These interactions involve sub - domains of p85 including iSH2 , C - SH2 , and N - SH2 domains , and sub - domains of p110 including C2 , helical , and the catalytic ( kinase ) domains ( Fig . 1C ) . Interactions between the C - SH2 domain of p85 and the catalytic subunit dif - fered depending on the isoform of the kinase [ 49 , 50 ] . In particular , the interaction of the p85 C - SH2 domain with the p110 kinase do - main occurs in PI - 3 kinase beta , but not in PI - 3 kinase alpha . How - ever , the interaction between the p85 iSH2 domain and the p110 C2 domain is weaker in PI - 3 kinase beta than in PI - 3 kinase alpha [ 51 ] . Because of this latter observation , and despite the presence of the additional inhibitory C - SH2 - kinase domain interaction , there is controversy as to whether PI - 3 kinase beta is more constitutively active than PI - 3 kinase alpha [ 47 ] . Moreover , for the beta isoform , ligands that disrupt the interaction between the C - SH2 domain and the catalytic domain have the potential to activate PI - 3 kinase , as has been proposed for the N - SH2 domain in both PI3 kinase iso - forms [ 52 ] . Data from our laboratory [ 6 ] and others [ 66 ] suggest that members of the Abi protein family ﬁt the paradigm for such regulatory ligands . We postulate that Abi1 regulates PI - 3 kinase activity through regulating the p85 SH2 domain interaction with the catalytic p110 subunit . WAVE complex integrity is central to its regulatory role in pro - moting actin polymerization . Several candidate mechanisms of regulation of WAVE complex have been proposed , all of which in - volve integrity of the complex requiring the presence of all constit - uents . This conclusion was conﬁrmed by in vitro reconstitution studies of WAVE complex [ 53 , 54 ] , siRNA studies in cultured cells [ 55 , 56 ] , and in cells with genetic inactivation of WAVE [ 57 ] or Abi1 genes [ 38 ] . Downregulation or removal of any integral WAVE complex protein leads to lower levels of speciﬁc WAVE complexes , which results in reduced WAVE activity as assessed by directly measuring actin polymerization in vitro , or by cellular motility and peripheral and dorsal rufﬂe formation assays . Actin polymerization requires active WAVE complex . Activation of WAVE complex involves a conformational change of inactive WAVE complex that renders the VCA domain available for interac - tion with Arp 2 / 3 [ 58 , 59 ] . Structural studies have revealed that the conformational change that releases intermolecular VCA from sequestration is induced by Rac - GTP binding to an allosteric site on the WAVE complex [ 58 ] . Full activation of WAVE complex re - quires prenylated , activated Rac1 and the presence of acidic phos - pholipids such as PIP3 [ 54 ] . PIP3 binds directly to the basic region of WAVE [ 60 , 61 ] . In addition to promoting activity of WAVE com - Fig . 1 . Structural determinants of WAVEand PI - 3 kinase complexes . ( A ) Anatomyof WAVE complex .

Activation of WAVE complex occurs upon conformational change leading to availability of VCA to bind Arp2 / 3 complex .

Abi1 phosphopeptides can bind N - SH2 and C - SH2 in vitro [ 6 ] raising the possibility of PI - 3 kinase activation by competing off - and thus alleviating with the inhibitory interaction imposed by p85 subunit . L . Kotula / FEBS Letters 586 ( 2012 ) 2790 – 2794 2791 plex , PIP3 is thought to help maintain membrane localization of the activated WAVE complex [ 60 ] . It has been proposed that Arf cooperates with Rac1 to activate WAVE complex , but the mecha - nism of this regulation has not been fully elucidated [ 62 ] . Phosphorylation regulates WAVE complex and Abi1 function . Serine phosphorylation of WAVE and Abi proteins has been found in active WAVE complex suggesting a possible role of serine phos - phorylation in WAVE activation [ 54 ] . This observation is consistent with the ﬁnding that Erk - dependent serine phosphorylation of Abi1 promotes cell motility [ 63 ] . The role of tyrosine phosphoryla - tion in WAVE complex activation is not well deﬁned . Tyrosine - phosphorylated Abi1 was not observed in the studies by Lebensohn reporting serine phosphorylation . The action of c - Abl tyrosine ki - nase was reported to abrogate WAVE complex in vitro [ 64 ] , but the mechanism of this regulation has not been determined . In con - trast , phosphorylation of WAVE2 at tyrosine 150 was proposed to promote activation of WAVE complex through an allosteric effect relieving VCA inhibition [ 58 ] . The role of Abi1 tyrosine phosphory - lation in WAVE complex regulation is possibly even more complex . Abi1 is phosphorylated on several tyrosine residues in an Abl ki - nase - dependent manner [ 65 , 66 ] . Phosphorylation of Abi1 tyrosine 213 ( pY213 ) also regulates Abl kinase activity [ 65 ] . Abi1 - pY213 transmits downstream signals through interaction with PI - 3 kinase regulatory subunit p85 [ 6 ] . Analysis of an Abi1 - Y213F mutant revealed a mechanism by which Abi1 might regulate macropinocytosis . The Y213F mutation blocked the interaction of Abi1 with the p85 subunit of PI - 3 kinase , resulting in enhanced macropinocytic uptake and abrogation of the ability of Abl kinase to regulate uptake [ 6 ] . Of interest , tyrosine phosphorylated Abi1 has not been detected in active WAVE com - plex [ 54 ] . Thus , we propose that non - tyrosine - phosphorylated Abi1 associates with WAVE complex , but tyrosine - phosphorylated Abi1 does not ( Fig . 2A ) . Upon tyrosine phosphorylation , Abi1 asso - ciates with the p85 subunit of PI - 3 kinase through several phos - photyrosine interactions , which we identiﬁed by unbiased SH2 domain screening [ 6 ] . We postulate that the Abi1 - p85 interaction competes with the inhibitory interaction of p85 with the catalytic subunit of PI - 3 kinase , as recently conﬁrmed for phosphopeptides interacting with the p85 - SH2 domain [ 50 ] . This hypothesis to ex - plain regulation of PI - 3 kinase by Abi1 is consistent with results from Abi1 siRNA knockdown studies , which demonstrated that downregulation of Abi1 ( putatively resulting in decreased PI - 3 ki - Fig . 2 . Regulation of WAVE and PI - 3 kinase by Abi1 . ( A ) A model for regulation of WAVE complex by phosphotyrosine - dependent interaction of Abi1 with p85 . Active WAVE complex promotes actin polymerization upstream of Arp2 / 3 complex . Under non - phosphorylated conditions , WAVE complex is inactive , and all components are bound within the complex . Activation of the complex requires binding of active , prenylated Rac1 and acidic phospholipids ( such as PIP3 ) , as well as serine phosphorylation of Abi1 [ 54 ] . The latter occurs downstream of Erk , which promotes WAVE complex activity [ 63 ] . Abl kinase is proposed to have a negative effect on WAVE complex activity in vitro [ 64 ] , although WAVE2 when phosphorylated on tyrosine 150 by Abl rescues membrane rufﬂing [ 78 ] . Abl - mediated phosphorylation of Abi1 leads to recruitment of Abi1 by p85 , whichoccurs throughbindingofphospho - Abi1 toN - SH2 and C - SH2domains [ 6 ] . We demonstratedthe feasibilityof theWAVEto p85shuttlinghypothesis byexpressing an Abi1 Y213F mutant , which led to enhanced macropinocytic uptake and cell spreading activity in comparison to wild type controls [ 6 ] . We postulate that this result is due to anincreaseinactive WAVEcomplex asAbi1 Y213F , becauseof itsreduced afﬁnity for p85 , is shiftedintoWAVE2 complex . ( B ) Diagram depictingahypothetical mechanism of reciprocal regulation of WAVE2 complex - dependent and PI - 3 kinase pathways . The presence of Abi1 within intact WAVE complex promotes its function in actin polymerization - dependent processes such as macropinocytosis and cellular adhesion . c - Abl - dependent tyrosine phosphorylation [ 6 , 65 ] leads to recruitment of phospho - Abi1 into a complex with p85 through an interaction with the p85 SH2 domain [ 6 ] leading to increased PI - 3 kinase activity . This leads to enhanced levels of phospho - Akt resulting in enhanced cellular proliferation . 2792 L . Kotula / FEBS Letters 586 ( 2012 ) 2790 – 2794 nase activity ) causes decreased levels of phosphorylated Akt in breast cancer cell lines [ 67 ] . Consistently with the proposed regu - lation , enhanced levels of phospho - Akt also correlate with high Abi1 expression in invasive breast cancer [ 21 ] . 3 . The shuttling hypothesis Tyrosine phosphorylation of Abi1 potentially regulates WAVE and PI - 3 kinase complexes . The emerging consensus is that Abi1 participates in complexes with WAVE and PI - 3 kinase p85 . Based on our results [ 6 ] and taking into consideration protein – protein interactions , we postulate that interaction of p85 with Abi1 plays an inhibitory role in actin polymerization . The interaction of p85 and Abi1 , which is Abl kinase - dependent and phosphotyrosine - dependent , occurs through the binding of the p85 SH2 domain to tyrosine phosphorylated Abi1 . Our single - site afﬁnity analysis suggests that the interaction between Abi1 and p85 involves coop - erative binding of multiple Abi1 phosphotyrosines with sites in the N - SH2 and C - SH2 domains of p85 [ 6 ] . p85 also interacts with Abi1 through a non - phosphorylation - dependent binding [ 6 ] , most likely involving the SH3 domain . These ﬁndings suggest that p85 - Abi1 binding is competitive with Abi1 interactions with WAVE complex components and precludes participation of tyrosine phosphory - lated Abi1 in WAVE complex . The critical function of Abi1 in WAVE complex [ 38 ] , therefore , is predicted to be negatively regulated by p85 binding . The fact that tyrosine phosphorylated Abi1 was not detected in WAVE complex suggests that the phosphorylation sta - tus of Abi1 determines its location—when phosphorylated , Abi1 is complexed with p85 - PI - 3 kinase ( although we cannot formally exclude the presence of p85 - Abi1 complexes independent from the catalytic domain and similar to sequestration complexes previ - ously observed with p85 - IRS - 1 [ 68 ] ) , and when non - phosphory - lated , Abi1 is bound by the WAVE complex [ 54 ] . The resultant ‘‘shuttling’’ of Abi1 between WAVE complex and p85 ( Fig . 2B ) is consistent both with enhanced actin polymerization resulting from WAVE complex / Arp2 / 3 activity , and with increased localized PIP3 content resulting from enhanced PI - 3 kinase activity , as occurs in macropinocytic cups [ 69 , 70 ] . These studies and other biological evidence [ 60 , 61 , 66 , 71 ] indicate that WAVE and Abi1 - p85 - PI - 3 ki - nase complexes are not mutually exclusive but work together to promote actin polymerization - dependent and PIP3 - dependent processes . Importantly , mutations affecting the proposed mecha - nism would likely affect the relative amount of the complexes , and thus , would alter the dynamic balance between actin polymer - ization and PI - 3 kinase function . This effect would result in altered PIP3 production , abnormal signaling , and tumorigenic growth . Oncogenic mutations involving the p85 C - SH2 domain have been observed in mammalian cancer [ 72 ] . Murine lymphomas contain deletions of the C - terminal region comprising the entire C - terminal SH2 domain [ 73 ] ; human ovarian and colon cancer contain smaller deletions immediately upstream of the C - SH2 domain [ 74 ] . By modeling the LNCaP tumorigenic mutation , i . e . , the heterozygous loss of Abi1 - pY213 [ 22 ] , we were able to compare actin polymeri - zation - dependent macropinocytosis in the context of interaction with p85 . We have shown that mutation of the critical Abi1 tyro - sine 213 , which is responsible for the p85 - C - terminal SH2 domain interaction , results in increased macropinocytosis [ 6 ] , which is consistent with enhanced WAVE complex activity . 4 . Concluding remarks We propose that this regulation might be generalized to differ - ent functions ascribed to the WAVE complex and Abi1 , and might be important for coordinated regulation of actin cytoskeleton downstream of WAVE complex and PI - 3 kinase activity . In addition to macropinocytosis , cell - to - cell adhesion requires WAVE function [ 75 , 76 ] . PI - 3 kinase activity is required for coincidental prolifera - tion and mitogenic signaling through PIP3 production . Under - standing the role of Abi1 in these regulatory processes should help to deﬁne mechanisms for coordinated actin polymerization and cellular proliferation , which are required for proper spatiotem - poral regulation of mitogenic and actin - dependent signaling events , which are dysregulated in human cancer .
