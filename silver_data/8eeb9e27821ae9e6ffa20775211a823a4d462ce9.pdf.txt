Abstract The cytoskeletal protein actin plays a critical role in the pathogenicity of Toxoplasma gondii , mediating invasion and egress , cargo transport , and organelle inheritance . Advances in live cell imaging have revealed extensive filamentous actin networks in the Apicomplexan parasite , but there is conflicting data regarding the biochemical and biophysical properties of Toxoplasma actin . Here , we imaged the in vitro assembly of individual Toxoplasma actin filaments in real time , showing that native , unstabilized filaments grow tens of microns in length . Unlike skeletal muscle actin , Toxoplasma filaments intrinsically undergo rapid treadmilling due to a high critical concentration , fast monomer dissociation , and rapid nucleotide exchange . Cryo - EM structures of stabilized and unstabilized filaments show an architecture like skeletal actin , with differences in assembly contacts in the D - loop that explain the dynamic nature of the filament , likely a conserved feature of Apicomplexan actin . This work demonstrates that evolutionary changes at assembly interfaces can tune dynamic properties of actin filaments without disrupting their conserved structure . Introduction The human pathogen Toxoplasma gondii ( T . gondii ) causes life - threatening disease in immunocompromised individuals and when infection occurs in utero ( 1 - 3 ) . T . gondii is a member of the Apicomplexan phylum that encompasses over 5000 species of parasites including a large number of parasites of medical and veterinary importance , including Cryptosporidium spp . and Plasmodium spp . , the causative agents of cryptosporidiosis and malaria respectively . 2 T . gondii is an obligate intracellular parasite . Survival and disease pathogenesis are dependent on host cell invasion , intracellular replication and egress , which results in destruction of the infected cells . T . gondii expresses a single divergent actin gene ( TgAct1 ) that is essential for successful completion of this lytic cycle . This isoform shares only 83 % similarity to skeletal alpha actin and mammalian β and γ isoforms ( 4 ) and was originally shown to be essential for the gliding motility of the parasite , host cell invasion and egress ( 5 - 8 ) . More recent studies have greatly expanded our understanding of other essential functions of actin in intracellular parasites . These include : inheritance of a non - photosynthetic plastid organelle named the apicoplast ( 9 , 10 ) , the directed movement of secretory vesicles called dense granules ( 11 ) , recycling of secretory vesicles called micronemes in dividing parasites ( 12 ) , morphology and positioning of Golgi and post - Golgi compartments , the movement of ER tubules ( 13 ) and conoid extension ( 14 ) . Despite its ubiquitous functions in Apicomplexan parasites , the organization of F - actin in T . gondii remained elusive for many years because conventional actin probes such as phalloidin , GFP - tagged actin , and LifeAct failed to detect filamentous structures ( 15 ) . The absence of filamentous actin was further supported by biochemical studies which showed that recombinantly purified HIS - TgAct1 formed only short unstable filaments in vitro ( reviewed in ( 15 ) ) . This also seemed to be the case for the closely related Plasmodium falciparum actin 1 , which shares 93 % sequence identity with TgAct1 . The idea that Apicomplexan actin does not polymerize into long filaments in vivo has recently been challenged with the development of an actin chromobody as a tool for imaging F - actin in T . gondii and P . falciparum ( 16 - 18 ) . Using this approach , studies have revealed vast tubular actin networks that connect individual parasites within host cells and remarkably dynamic actin networks within the parasite cytosol ( 17 , 18 ) . The success of using the actin chromobody is likely because it shows minimal effects on actin dynamics compared to other probes ( 19 , 20 ) . Recently , recombinantly purified actin chromobody has been used as a tool to study the dynamics of recombinantly purified P . falciparum actin in vitro and showed that it can polymerize into long dynamic filaments ( 21 ) . These results are more consistent with the observation of filamentous networks in the cell and also indicate that assembly factors are not required for its polymerization . While these studies have provided novel insights into TgAct1 organization , many biochemical and structural questions remain . There is conflicting data on whether TgAct1 has a high or low critical concentration , as both have been reported for Apicomplexan actin ( 21 - 23 ) . It has also been reported that TgAct1 filaments assemble isodesmically , and therefore lack a critical concentration ( 22 ) . Intriguingly , long filaments of TgAct1 or P . falciparum Act1 have rarely been observed directly using electron microscopy without stabilizing agents , which has led to the idea that long filaments of TgAct1 can only form in the presence of stabilizers ( 24 ) . A lack of high - resolution structures of unstabilized TgAct1 or P . falciparum Act1 filaments has also hindered exploration of the unusual properties of Apicomplexan actin . In this work , we used epifluorescence microscopy to image the growth of TgAct1 filaments in vitro . We find that TgAct1 can form filaments tens of microns in length that rapidly treadmill . This feature is due to an unusually rapid subunit dissociation constant at the pointed - end and a nucleotide exchange rate constant from the monomer that is 50 - fold faster than that of skeletal muscle actin . Using electron cryomicroscopy , we determined the structures of both jasplakinolide - stabilized and native , unstabilized TgAct1 filaments . In these two conditions , we found that the DNase I - binding loop ( D - loop ) adopts different conformations , with the unstabilized conformation likely contributing to rapid filament subunit dissociation . Taken together , this study not only resolves outstanding questions in the field regarding the ability of TgAct1 to form long filaments and its assembly properties , but also demonstrates how new dynamic properties can evolve within the constraints of a filament architecture . 3 Results TgAct1 polymerizes into long filaments in vitro with a high critical concentration Because modifications to actin , such as tags or direct labeling , can influence the biochemical and kinetic properties of actin polymerization , we purified unmodified TgAct1 . Untagged TgAct1 ( ToxoDB : TgME49 _ 209030 ) was prepared by expressing the gene in SF9 cells fused to a C - terminal β - thymosin – 6xHIS tag , which maintains the actin in a monomeric state during expression and allows for removal by chymotrypsin , resulting in an untagged and unmodified protein product ( Fig . 1a and b , Ext . Data Fig . 1a ) . This strategy was previously used for the expression of P . falciparum and Dictyostelium actin , which shares 95 % and 85 % identity to TgAct1 respectively ( 21 , 25 , 26 ) . Polymerization of individual actin filaments was imaged in real - time using an epifluorescence microscopy - based in vitro actin polymerization assay ( Fig . 1c ) . The fluorophore , a recombinantly purified actin chromobody tagged with EmeraldFP ( Ext . Data Fig . 1b , hereafter referred to as chromobodies ) was previously used to observe filament dynamics and organization in T . gondii cells ( 16 ) , and as a novel method for imaging in vitro polymerization of P . falciparum actin ( 21 ) . The advantage of this approach is that actin polymerization can be visualized without fluorescent labeling of actin monomers , which has been shown to dramatically affect skeletal actin assembly and disassembly rate constants ( 27 ) . Consistent with this , we find that TgAct1 conjugated directly with rhodamine to Cys374 shows poor incorporation into filaments ( Ext . Data Fig . 1c ) , and thus unsuitable for visualizing TgAct1 polymerization in vitro . Using the chromobody approach , we observe robust TgAct1 polymerization at concentrations above 12 µM actin , with filaments growing to greater than 60 µm in length ( Fig . 1d - f and Video S1 ) . To demonstrate that TgAct1 can form long filaments in the absence of the chromobody , we polymerized filaments in a flow chamber without chromobodies for 10 minutes . Chromobodies were then added and imaged before filaments disassembled in the absence of actin monomers . When we do this , we observe filaments longer than 10 µm , indicating that TgAct1 is able to polymerize into long filaments in the absence of chromobodies or other stabilizing agents such as jasplakinolide ( Ext . Data Fig . 2 ) . Strikingly , over the concentration range measured ( 12 - 24 µM ) , individual filaments treadmill , depolymerizing at the pointed - end while elongating at the barbed - end ( Fig . 1e and Video S2 ) . Treadmilling is readily visualized in kymographs ( distance vs time ) , which shows pointed - end disassembly ( left ) and barbed - end elongation ( right ) of representative filaments at an actin concentration of 16 µM ( Fig . 1g ) . This property is also a characteristic of P . falciparum actin ( 21 ) and is thus a likely conserved feature of Apicomplexan actins , which are all divergent from skeletal muscle actin ( 4 , 28 ) . Long term imaging of actin polymerization shows that filaments continue to polymerize at a constant rate for 20 minutes of imaging ( Fig . 1f ) . The actin concentration - dependence of assembly and disassembly rates provides the critical concentration ( C c ) and the rate constants for subunit incorporation and dissociation at the barbed and pointed ends of filaments . A linear fit to plots of the assembly or disassembly versus actin concentration can be used to determine the critical concentration ( x - intercept ) , subunit dissociation rate constant ( y - intercept ) and subunit association rate constant ( slope ) at each end ( 29 ) . As a control , we imaged the polymerization of different concentrations of skeletal muscle actin using the chromobody and found that the critical concentration ( 0 . 09 µM ) , disassembly rate constant ( 1 . 2 sec - 1 ) and assembly rate constant ( 12 . 7 μM - 1 ·s - 1 ) are consistent with previously reported values ( 29 ) , which is further evidence that the chromobodies do not influence the polymerization , critical concentration , or subunit incorporation rate constants ( Fig 1h , orange , Table 1 ) . 4 The rate constants and critical concentration of TgAct1 deviate significantly from those of skeletal muscle actin . For the TgAct1 barbed - end , the critical concentration is 6 . 5 ± 1 . 2 µM ( Fig . 1h , blue , Table 1 ) which is ~ 50 - fold higher compared to skeletal muscle actin ( 29 ) . We find that the disassembly rate constant at the barbed - end of TgAct1 filaments is 15 . 1 ± 2 . 1 sec - 1 and the assembly rate constant ( k + ) is 2 . 3 ± 0 . 3 μM - 1 ·s - 1 which indicates that the barbed - end of TgAct1 disassembles about 15 times faster and assembles about 6 times slower compared to skeletal actin ( 29 ) . A linear fit to the pointed - end disassembly rate versus TgAct1 concentration shows that that the average critical concentration ( x - intercept , 73 . 5 ± 25 . 6 µM ) is ~ 60 - fold higher than the pointed - end of skeletal muscle actin , which arises from a disassembly rate constant ( y - intercept , 10 . 6 ± 1 . 4 sec - 1 ) that is 33 - fold faster than skeletal actin ( 30 ) and a slow assembly rate constant ( 0 . 2 ± 0 . 04 sec - 1 ) ( Fig . 1i , blue , Table 1 ) . Given the high critical concentration , we measured the cellular concentrations of TgAct1 to assess if they are sufficient to support polymerization in vivo , in the absence of polymerization factors . As shown by western blot ( Fig . 2a ) , T . gondii has a relatively high cytosolic actin concentration compared to other cell types ( Fig . 2b ) , and this concentration would be sufficient to drive actin polymerization from both filament ends because the cellular concentration is above the critical concentration for polymerization at both filament ends . Rapid nucleotide turnover and exchange allows for intrinsic TgAct1 filament treadmilling Next , we wished to understand how the ATPase properties of TgAct1 differ from skeletal actin to maintain filament treadmilling . We polymerized TgAct1 and monitored inorganic phosphate ( Pi ) release using an MESG assay ( 31 , 32 ) . For skeletal actin , the amount of phosphate released plateaus at an equimolar amount of F - actin ( Fig . 2c , orange ) . This was expected because once F - actin formation plateaus , the rate of filament subunit disassembly , nucleotide exchange and reincorporation is negligible on this timescale . That is , polymerized subunits undergo a single ATPase turnover . Since nucleotide exchange does not occur in monomers incorporated into a filament , polymerized subunits generate inorganic phosphate once , and then must disassemble from the filament in order for nucleotide exchange to occur ( 33 - 35 ) . Strikingly , TgAct1 phosphate release does not plateau , and each TgAct1 releases ( on average ) 3 phosphates over the 1 - hour time course ( Fig . 2c , blue ) . This indicates that each actin subunit hydrolyzes multiple ATP molecules during the timescale of the experiment , consistent with TgAct1 treadmilling . As a control , we measured the Pi release rate over a range of actin concentrations ( Fig . 2d ) . As expected , the Pi release rate increases with actin concentration with steady - state ATPase rate ( slope ) of 8 . 5 x 10 - 4 μM - 1 ·s - 1 . MgADP - actin subunits that dissociate from filaments exchange bound MgADP for MgATP before incorporating to the barbed - end ( 30 , 33 , 35 , 36 ) . For skeletal actin , the rate constant for nucleotide exchange is slow ( 37 - 41 ) and generally requires exchange factors , such as profilin , for recharging the monomers with MgATP ( 42 - 44 ) . Because TgAct1 rapidly treadmills in the absence of exchange factors ( Fig . 1e and Fig . 2c ) , we hypothesized that nucleotide exchange from TgAct1 must be faster compared to skeletal actin . To test this hypothesis , ATP was exchanged for ethenoATP ( MgεATP ) which displays a fluorescence enhancement at 410 nm when bound to actin . The dissociation rate constant for εATP was determined by competing bound MgεATP a large molar excess of unlabeled MgATP and monitoring the change in fluorescence over time ( 40 , 41 , 45 ) . The εATP dissociation from skeletal actin was slow ( k - εATP = 0 . 003 ± 0 . 0002 sec - 1 ) ( Fig . 2e - f , orange ) consistent with previous results ( 33 , 38 ) . In contrast , the exchange of εATP from TgAct1 was over 50 - times faster ( k - εATP = 0 . 16 ± 0 . 03 sec - 1 ) ( Fig . 2e - f , blue ) . The fast nucleotide exchange explains how TgAct1 can rapidly exchange bound nucleotide and become competent for filament assembly , even without nucleotide exchange factors . 5 Optimization of experimental conditions for cryo - electron microscopy of Toxoplasma actin filaments Next , we sought to use cryo - electron microscopy to determine the structural basis for the distinct polymerization properties of TgAct1 . Initial negative stain micrographs in 0 . 1 mM ATP incubated for 1 hour at 37 °C with or without jasplakinolide reproduced what has been reported in the literature ( 22 , 46 ) ; long filaments are visible with jasplakinolide , whereas short filaments assemble without jasplakinolide ( Ext . Data Fig . 3a and 3b ) . Substituting the stabilizing , non - hydrolysable analog AMPPNP for ATP in the polymerization buffer produced filaments without jasplakinolide ( Ext . Data Fig . 3c ) , but we were hesitant to use a non - native ligand for structural exploration because inclusion of 0 . 1 mM AMPPNP in the actin growth assay resulted in an ~ 1 . 5 - fold increase in the disassembly rate from the barbed - end and 2 - fold increase in the critical concentration compared to MgATP conditions ( Ext . Data Fig . 4 ) . Based on our kinetic data , we tested filament conditions that might slow filament disassembly . Shortening the incubation period and lowering the assembly temperature to 25°C did not produce any filaments ( Ext . Data Fig . 3d ) . Decreasing the incubation time and increasing the ATP concentration produced promising results . At time points between 10 and 30 minutes , long filaments are observed in negative stain , with some filaments extending several microns ( Ext . Data Fig . 3e and 3f ) . This observation suggests that due to the treadmilling , ATP hydrolysis and nucleotide exchange are rapid enough for TgAct1 to consume the majority of the 0 . 1 mM ATP in 1 hour in the initial reaction conditions . Given the steady - state ATPase rate ( Fig . 2d , 8 . 5 x 10 - 4 μM - 1 ·s - 1 ) , 33 µm TgAct1 should hydrolyze 0 . 1 mM MgATP in one hour . Decreasing the incubation time and increasing the ATP concentration allowed us to circumvent this outcome . Thus , to capture long filaments in cryo conditions , we froze TgAct1 samples after a 10 to 20 - minute incubation period with 1 mM ATP ( Fig . 3a ) . Structure of unstabilized ADP - bound TgAct1 filaments reveal altered D - loop positioning and decreased buried surface area We determined the structure of unstabilized TgAct1 filaments at 2 . 5 Å resolution , which revealed an overall architecture similar to skeletal and other actin filament structures ( Fig . 3b , Ext . Data Fig . 5 and 6A , Table 2 ) . TgAct1 and skeletal muscle actin share 83 % sequence identity ( 4 ) , and the structures show many similarities . As we identified MgADP in the nucleotide binding site ( Ext . Data Fig . 6b ) , we compared TgAct1 to structures of rabbit and chicken skeletal muscle actin bound to MgADP ( PDB IDs 8d13 and 8a2t ) ( 47 , 48 ) . A single TgAct1 protomer is in nearly the same conformation as skeletal actin , with C α RMSD values of 0 . 5 and 0 . 8 for chicken and rabbit actin , respectively ( Supplemental Movie 3 ) . The helical symmetry of TgAct1 , 28 . 1 Å rise and - 167 . 1° twist , is nearly identical to chicken and rabbit MgADP actin filaments , at 28 . 1 and 27 . 5 Å rise , respectively , and - 166 . 7° twist for both . However , there are notable differences between the structures . The most striking difference is in the position of the D - loop ( residues 40 - 51 in TgAct1 and residues 39 - 50 in skeletal muscle actin ) , which forms important longitudinal contacts between actin protomers ( Ext . Data Fig . 6c - d ) . In TgAct1 filaments , the D - loop has shifted , moving the loop partially out of the pocket where the loop is typically bound , with a C α RMSD value of 2 . 1 when compared to chicken skeletal actin ( 47 ) . There are six amino acid substitutions on the D - loop in TgAct1 relative to skeletal actin ( Ext . Data Fig . 7 ) . Two of these substitutions , amino acids Pro42 and Ile44 , point in the opposite direction relative to the comparable residues in skeletal actin ( Gln41 and Val43 ) ( Fig . 3c ) . While Val43 of skeletal actin sits within a hydrophobic portion of the binding pocket , the comparable residue in TgAct1 ( Ile44 ) is displaced by 5 Å and does not make inter - protomer contacts ( Fig . 3d - e ) . These changes in the D - loop conformation break most of the backbone interactions that occur 6 among skeletal actin D - loop residues 41 - 44 ( TgAct1 42 - 44 ) , and hydrogen bond contacts between side chains are lost due to a combination of residue substitution and mainchain displacement ( TgAct1 amino acids 39 - 41 and 46 ) ( Fig . 3f - g , Ext . Data Fig . 8a and b ) . In contrast to the substitutions on the D - loop , the amino acids in the pocket of the longitudinally adjacent protomer where the D - loop binds are identical between TgAct1 and skeletal actin ( Fig . 3f - g ) . Overall , this reduces the buried surface area in this interaction by about one third , from 638 Å 2 in chicken skeletal actin ( PDB ID 8d13 ) to 485 Å 2 in TgAct1 . The D - loop position and resulting decrease in longitudinal protomer contacts likely contribute to the decreased filament stability of TgAct1 , explaining the rapid depolymerization rate constant and high critical concentration . Other structural differences between TgAct1 and skeletal actin filaments are more modest . The C - terminal phenylalanine of TgAct1 occupies a different position than skeletal actin and in TgAct1 it does not interact with the D - loop as it does in skeletal actin ( Fig . 3f - g ) . Tyr54 from TgAct1 ( skeletal actin Tyr53 ) establishes a hydrogen bond with Tyr170 ( skeletal actin Tyr169 ) on the neighboring protomer ( Ext . Data Fig . 8a and b ) . There are four substitutions on the hydrophobic loop ( TgAct1 residues 263 - 275 ) , but the mainchain retains the same conformation . The substituted side chains only make intraprotomer contacts ; however , one of the substitutions ( TgAct1 Lys270 – skeletal actin Met 269 ) adds a hydrogen bond with the backbone of Asp180 , subtly shifting the mainchain around residues 177 - 180 ( Ext . Data Fig . 8c ) . Comparing the total buried surface area for one protomer of TgAct1 versus one protomer of skeletal actin provides a summation of the changes : TgAct1 loses 364 Å 2 of buried surface area relative to skeletal actin filaments ( 8d13 : 3115 Å 2 ; TgAct1 : 2751 Å 2 ) , the majority of which is from the change in the position of the D - loop ( Figure 3h - i ) . The D - loop of Jasplakinolide - stabilized TgAct1 filaments closely resembles skeletal and P . falciparum TgAct1 has 93 % sequence identity to Plasmodium falciparum actin 1 , and the D - loops and the pocket where the D - loops bind are identical . ( Ext . Data Fig . 7 ) . Despite this identity , the D - loops of native TgAct1 and P . falciparum Act1 stabilized with jasplakinolide have different conformations ( Fig . 4a , Ext . Data Fig . 8d ) . The D - loop conformation of jasplakinolide - stabilized P . falciparum Act1 is similar to the D - loops of both unstabilized skeletal actin filaments and the second P . falciparum actin isoform , Act2 . Skeletal actin has a distinct D - loop conformation when bound to jasplakinolide ( Ext . Data Fig . 8e ) . This suggests that the effect of jasplakinolide on actin filaments are not uniform across actin isoforms and that its effects on TgAct1 may differ from skeletal or P . falciparum actins . To test this hypothesis , we solved a structure of TgAct1 bound to jasplakinolide at 3 . 0 Å ( Fig . 4b , Ext . Data Fig . 6 , 6a - f , Table 2 ) . Jasplakinolide - bound filaments retained the same helical parameters as unstabilized filaments ( 28 . 1 Å rise and - 167º twist ) . The nucleotide binding site contained MgADP ( Ext . Data Fig . 6b ) and the protomers of the filaments are very similar , with a C α RMSD of 0 . 5 Å . As expected , jasplakinolide binds in the same location in TgAct1 filaments as it is found in skeletal and P . falciparum filaments ( Ext . Data Fig . 6f ) . It primarily bridges the lateral interaction between protomers and increases the lateral surface contacts from 702 Å 2 in unstabilized filaments to 1016 Å 2 in jasplakinolide - bound filaments . The D - loop of the jasplakinolide - bound filament adopts a conformation nearly identical to that of jasplakinolide - bound P . falciparum Act1 and skeletal actin loops that is distinct from the unstabilized TgAct1 loop ( Fig . 4c and d , Ext . Data Fig . 6c - d ) . C α RMSD values comparing the D - loops demonstrate the overlap : 0 . 8 and 1 . 2 comparing jasplakinolide - bound TgAct1 to jasplakinolide - bound P . falciparum Act1 and native chicken skeletal actin , respectively . With jasplakinolide bound , amino acids Pro42 and Ile44 point into the binding pocket , though the volume does suggest some mixed occupancy with the unstabilized D - loop conformation that we were unable to resolve by classification ( Ext . Data Fig . 6c - d ) . There is also a shift in residues 51 - 7 53 outside of the D - loop , which is not seen in other structures . Here , the volume suggests that the Cys53 may have become oxidized , possibly leading to the change ( Ext . Data Fig . 6g ) . The C - terminus of the protein is unresolved past residue His372 in the jasplakinolide - bound structure ( Ext . Data Fig . 6h ) . More subtle shifts occur among the subdomains within one protomer . The overall effect is for residues 139 - 144 and 169 - 173 in subdomain 2 and residues 352 - 370 in subdomain 1 to pinch the D - loop in its binding pocket , likely stabilizing its position ( Fig . 4e ) , which suggests that the TgAct1 D - loop can adopt at least two conformations within the filament . Neither actin isoform from P . falciparum shows large differences in the positioning of the D - loop when compared to skeletal actin filaments ( 24 , 49 , 50 ) . For P . falciparum Act2 , the substitution of an asparagine for the glycine at position 42 might facilitate a more stable filament . In contrast , biochemical work on P . falciparum Act1 suggests that the D - loop contributes to the instability of the filaments ( 21 , 24 ) . Because of the high identity of P . falciparum Act1 to TgAct1 , it appears possible that in unstabilized filaments the P . falciparum Act1 D - loop could adopt the same position as the unstabilized TgAct1 D - loop . Discussion Properties of TgAct1 filaments In this study , we show that TgAct1 is capable of polymerizing into long filaments in the absence of assembly factors , stabilizers , or the actin chromobody , which is currently the only actin probe capable of detecting actin filaments in Apicomplexan parasites . Unlike skeletal actin , TgAct1 filaments rapidly treadmill at concentrations of actin above 12 µM ( Fig . 5 ) . This unusual feature has also been observed for P . falciparum Act1 ( 21 ) which shares 93 % sequence identity to TgAct1 and thus , appears to be a conserved feature of Apicomplexican actin . The structural basis for rapid disassembly is likely explained by the conformation and dynamics of the D - loop . Our structures reveal two distinct D - loop conformations for the stabilized vs . unstabilized structure : in the jasplakinolide stabilized structure , the D - loop is fully inserted into the binding pocket , whereas in the absence of stabilizing agents , the loop is partially out of the binding pocket . It suggests that the loop makes the full set of contacts during filament assembly and shifts after assembly , decreasing the number of longitudinal interactions . Given the role of the D - loop in regulating F - actin stability through longitudinal contacts , we propose that these structural differences may account for the reduced filament stability and high dissociation constants at the pointed - end that drive treadmilling ( Fig . 5 , inset ) . Further support for this idea comes from data showing that replacing the P . falciparum Act1 D - loop with the mammalian sequence has a stabilizing effect on the filament ( 24 ) accompanied by a ∼ 5 - fold reduction in the critical concentration ( 21 ) . Despite the known importance of the D - loop in regulating P . falciparum Act1 filament stability , previous structures of P . falciparum Act1 stabilized with jasplakinolide observed minimal differences in the position of the D - loop of P . falciparum Act1 relative to skeletal muscle actin ( 49 ) . The D - loop differences between stabilized and unstabilized TgAct1 filaments helps to reconcile why previous structures of P . falciparum Act1 could not fully explain the importance of the D - loop in filament stability . In order to support rapid treadmilling , TgAct1 monomers must quickly release ADP and recharge with ATP in the absence of nucleotide exchange factors . Exploration of the hinge regions involved in the F to G transition did not reveal any substantive differences between TgAct1 and skeletal actin . There is only one substitution within the nucleotide binding pocket between skeletal muscle actin and TgAct1 : a leucine ( Leu16 ) is substituted with an asparagine ( Asn17 ) in TgAct1 ( Ext . Data Fig . 7 and 8f ) . P . falciparum Act1 , like TgAct1 , also contains this substitution ( 24 ) . 8 Comparison of the gelsolin - bound actin structures of P . falciparum Act1 and skeletal actin ( 51 , 52 ) to the stabilized filament structure of P . falciparum Act1 and the unstabilized filament structure of TgAct1 suggests how the residue might affect the nucleotide exchange rate . The G - actin structure of P . falciparum Act1 shows Asn17 hydrogen bonding with the backbone carbonyl of Phe34 in the adjacent beta strand . For this change to occur , the hydrogen bond with the alpha phosphate in the filament protomer must be broken and the gamma carbon of Asn17 must move 1 . 6 Å toward the backbone carbonyl of Phe34 . In contrast , the gamma carbon of hydrophobic Leu16 only moves half that distance ( Ext . Data Fig . 8g ) . The substitution of the asparagine for the leucine and the associated shifts in G - actin unbury part of the nucleotide , and decrease the hydrophobic character while widening a portion of the binding pocket , potentially facilitating nucleotide exchange . Conflicting views on the properties of Apicomplexan actin This work challenges the idea that TgAct1 forms only short unstable filaments . We consistently observe filaments longer than 20 µm using fluorescent microscopy , and filaments longer than 1 µm that span the micrographs in negative stain electron microscopy . In addition , bulk ATPase assays indicate that 24 µM TgAct1 monomers treadmill into and out of the filament three times per hour . Given the dissociation constant from the pointed - end ( 11 sec - 1 ) , the average filament length under these conditions is estimated to be ~ 36 µm . Previous methods for measuring TgAct1 filament length were either indirect , using centrifugation , or by negative stain electron microscopy of filaments near their critical concentration , where low availability of monomers limit their length ( 46 ) . It is unclear whether the N - terminal HIS tag used in previous studies influences TgAct1 or P . falciparum Act1 filament stability and length . While there are differences in the reported critical concentration for Apicomplexan actins , our results are largely consistent with the high critical concentration obtained by Lu et al . for P . falciparum Act1 ( 21 ) . Previous experiments that found low critical concentrations for TgAct1 ( 22 ) or P . falciparum Act1 ( 23 ) were performed over time courses many hours in length . Our ATPase results indicate that unlike skeletal actin , TgAct1 will be completely converted to MgADP ( Fig . 2c ) and long filaments will be lost over these long time periods because ADP - actin has a 10 - fold increased critical concentration compared to ATP - actin ( 21 , 30 ) . In addition , monitoring polymerization of apicomplexican actin overnight is also problematic because small oligomers form when not stabilized by the addition of ammonium acetate ( 23 ) , which can complicate the interpretation of light scattering or pyrene fluorescence . Implications for rapidly treadmilling filaments in T . gondii parasites In vivo visualization of actin in T . gondii using the actin chromobody has revealed a vast network of highly dynamic actin that is well supported by its in vitro properties ( 12 ) . Because the concentration of TgAct1 in the cell is near the critical concentration for the pointed - end , its assembly and disassembly may be locally fine - tuned by actin sequestering proteins which could function to drive the dynamics of F - actin in T . gondii . Apicomplexan parasites have an unusually limited repertoire of actin binding proteins ( 28 ) . T . gondii encodes a single gene of ADF and profilin , and three formins . In mammalian cells , profilin binds to G - actin and plays a dual function in nucleotide exchange and enhancement of formin - mediated actin polymerization ( 53 - 55 ) . Considering our finding that TgAct1 has an extremely fast nucleotide exchange rate , the function of profilin may be restricted to enhancing actin polymerization from one of the three formins in the cell . The actin - depolymerizing factor ( ADF ) / cofilin is a family of proteins that regulate the turnover of actin networks in the cell ( 56 - 59 ) . ADF / cofilin proteins typically bind F - actin and destabilize filament networks by severing actin filaments and accelerating depolymerization from 9 the pointed - end . ADF is essential to the survival of T . gondii and its depletion promotes the assembly of F - actin structures in the cell ( 7 , 16 ) . Interestingly , Apicomplexican ADF lacks the residues for binding F - actin and therefore shows very weak severing activities . Instead , it exclusively binds and sequesters G - actin ( 7 , 60 ) . Severing activities was likely lost because of the high disassembly rates of TgAct1 , which did not necessitate severing for fast disassembly . Thus , ADF functions primarily in T . gondii to regulate the pool of available actin monomers . A key property of TgAct1 that makes it primed for rapid disassembly is the ~ 30 - fold higher disassembly rate for the pointed - end compared to skeletal actin . Thus , below the critical concentration , TgAct1 filaments will depolymerize ~ 30 - times faster than conventional actin . Considering our findings that the cellular concentration of TgAct1 is less than 2 - fold from the critical concentration of pointed - end , small changes in the expression of ADF , or its activation through post - translational modification may allow for rapid transitioning from filament to monomer without the need for actin severing proteins or disassembly factors . Why does Apicomplexican actin have an unusually high critical concentration ? This novel property would seemingly require the expression of roughly 10 - times more actin and regulatory proteins to generate filaments which is energetically wasteful . We propose that the high critical concentration is a functional consequence of the high monomer disassembly rates . While more actin expression is required for filament growth , the fast disassembly rates allow the parasite to quickly disassemble the actin network with a minimal set of actin regulatory factors . Such a mechanism could have evolved due to constraints of the lytic cycle on parasite survival . Intracellular parasites contain an extensive and dynamic actin network . When calcium ionophore is used to trigger parasite egress the network rapidly disassembles in less than 60 seconds , prior to the onset of parasite motility ( 16 ) . During motility and egress , actin is enriched at the parasites basal end ( 18 ) . Thus , parasite motility and the transition from the intracellular to extracellular states ( and vice versa ) , necessitate fast reorganization of the actin network and transitions between F and G - actin . Due to its ubiquity across the domains of life , actin serves as a model for evolutionary tuning of the dynamic properties of a conserved polymer . In general , eukaryotic actin is highly conserved at the sequence level and in the overall structure of the filament , and achieves functional diversity in part through interactions with a host of regulatory proteins that tune its dynamic properties . Bacterial actins , on the other hand , typically have many fewer interacting partners , which has allowed evolutionary diversification to yield different dynamic properties through sequence changes that introduce significant changes to the filament architecture ( 61 ) . TgAct1 sits between these two extremes , demonstrating that smaller evolutionary changes can give rise to new dynamic properties without large changes to the overall filament structure . 10 Methods DNA expression constructs TgAct1 ( ToxoDB : TgGME49 _ 209030 ) was fused as its C - terminus to a 14 amino acid GS linker sequence followed by a β - thymosin – 6xHIS tag and inserted into pFastBac ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) behind the p10 promoter for expression in Sf9 cells . The β - thymosin fusion strategy was previously used for the expression of Plasmodium falciparum and Dictyostelium actin , which shares 95 % and 85 % identity to TgAct1 respectively ( 21 , 25 , 26 ) . The Actin - chromobody ( ChromoTek Inc . , Hauppauge , NY ) containing a C - terminal EmeraldFP – 6xHIS tag was cloned into pET22b ( Novagen ) for expression in E . coli BL21 ( DE3 ) ( 16 ) . Protein expression and purification Expression and purification of untagged TgAct1 was adapted from previous methods ( 21 , 25 ) . Two billion Sf9 cells were infected with virus and grown for 3 days at 27°C . Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 2000 RPM and resuspended in 50 mL lysis buffer ( 10 mM HEPES , pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 25 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 3 M NaCl , 0 . 5 mM DTT , 0 . 5 mM Na 2 ATP , 5 µg / mL leupeptin , 1x cOmplete ULTRA Tablets ( Roche ) ) . Cells were lysed by sonication in an ice water bath and then clarified at 250 , 000 x g for 35 minutes . The supernatant was then added to 3 mL of HIS Select Nickel affinity gel ( Sigma ) equilibrated in wash buffer ( 10 mM HEPES , pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 25 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 3 M NaCl , 0 . 5 mM DTT , 0 . 25 mM Na 2 ATP ) for 45 minutes at 4°C . The affinity gel was then lightly sedimented at 4°C , 600 RPM and added to a column and washed with 15 bed volumes of wash buffer followed by 6 bed volumes of wash buffer containing 10 mM Imidazole ( pH 8 ) . The protein was eluted with wash buffer containing 200 mM Imidazole , pH 8 . Peak fractions were concentrated to 2 mL Amicon Ultra - 50 ( Millipore ) and dialyzed against 1 L G buffer overnight ( 5 mM Tris , pH 8 . 2 , 0 . 25 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 5 mM DTT , 0 . 25 mM Na 2 ATP , 1 µg / mL leupeptin , 4°C ) . Protein was divided into 150 µL aliquots , snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at - 80°C . Small scale chymotrypsin digests were performed to determine the optimal molar ratios of chymotrypsin : TgAct1 – β - thymosin – HIS for removal of the β - thymosin – HIS tag . Volumes of 20 µL of actin were incubated with chymotrypsin ( Sigma ) at the indicated molar ratio ( Extended Data Fig . 1a ) in a 27°C water bath for 15 minutes and then quenched with 0 . 5 mM PMSF ( Roche ) . Samples were analyzed on a Coomassie stained SDS - PAGE PAGE gel . Once an optimal molar ratio was determined , the remaining prep was digested , quenched with PMSF , clarified 400 , 000 x g for 30 minutes and applied to a Resource Q ( GE Healthcare ) ion exchange column equilibrated with G buffer . TgAct1 was separated from the cleaved tag by applying a 0 – 0 . 5 M NaCl salt gradient in G buffer . Fractions containing purified tagless TgAct1 were concentrated to 0 . 5 mL and dialysed overnight against G - buffer containing 0 . 2 M ammonium acetate , pH 8 , 4°C , which prevents spontaneous actin oligomerization ( 21 , 23 ) . The following day , the sample was clarified 400 , 000 x g for 30 minutes and applied to a Superdex 200 Increase 10 / 300 GL ( GE Healthcare ) gel filtration column equilibrated in G - buffer containing 0 . 2 M ammonium acetate . Fractions corresponding to monomeric actin were pooled , concentrated in an Amicon Ultra - 15 ( Millipore ) , snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at - 80°C . The actin chromobody was purified from E . coli , BL21 ( DE3 ) . Transfected cells were grown to mid log ( OD = 0 . 7 ) and induced with 0 . 4 mM IPTG ( Roche ) and grown overnight at 16°C . Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3500 RPM and resuspended in 40 mL lysis buffer ( 10 mM NaPO 4 , 300 mM NaCl , 0 . 5 % glycerol , 7 % sucrose , pH 7 . 4 at 22°C , 0 . 5 % NP40 , 0 . 5 mM PMSF , 1x protease inhibitor tablets ( Pierce ) ) . Lysozyme ( Sigma ) was added to 3 mg / mL and incubated at 4°C for 30 minutes . The cell lysate was then sonicated in an ice water bath and then clarified at 250 , 000 x g for 35 minutes . The supernatant was then added to 3 mL of HIS Select Nickel affinity gel ( Sigma ) equilibrated in wash buffer ( 10 mM NaPO 4 , 300 mM NaCl , 0 . 5 % glycerol , pH 7 . 4 at 22°C , 0 . 5 mM DTT ) for 45 minutes at 4°C . The affinity gel was passed over a column and washed 11 with 20 bed volumes of wash buffer followed by 10 bed volumes of wash buffer containing 10 mM Imidazole ( pH 7 . 4 ) . The protein was eluted with wash buffer containing 200 mM Imidazole , pH 7 . 4 . Peak fractions were concentrated to 3 mL and dialyzed against 0 . 2 L glycerol storage buffer ( 25 mM Imidazole , pH 7 . 4 , 300 mM NaCl , 50 % glycerol , 1 mM DTT ) . The final protein concentration was determined using a Bradford reagent ( Thermo Scientific ) . In vitro actin growth assay TgAct1 was thawed and clarified at 400 , 000 x g for 30 minutes . The storage buffer was exchanged with G buffer using a Zeba spin - desalting column ( Thermo Fisher ) and the actin was stored on ice for up to 4 hours . The concentration of the actin was determined by absorbance at 280 nm ( 1 OD = 38 . 5 µM ) . It should be noted that determining actin concentration using Bradford gives an measurement approximately 2 - fold less than that measured by absorbance which could account in part for ~ 2 - fold difference in the calculated C c between Plasmodium actin ( 21 ) and Toxoplasma actin ( this study ) . The visualization of actin growth in vitro was adapted from previous studies on Plasmodium actin ( 21 , 25 ) . Flow chambers were bound to minimal densities of NEM treated muscle myosin , which is ATP - insensitive and functions to keep filaments in the imaging plane . The flow cells were then rinsed with ice cold buffer B ( 25 mM Imidazole , pH 7 . 4 , 50 mM KCl , 2 . 5 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 10 mM DTT ) , and blocked with buffer B containing 5 mg / mL BSA and 1 % Pluronic F127 . The indicated concentrations of G actin diluted in G buffer was mixed 1 : 1 with 2x polymerization buffer ( 50 mM Imidazole , pH 7 . 4 , 5 % methylcellulose , 100 mM KCl , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM EGTA , 20 mM DTT , 5 mg / mL BSA , 1 % Pluronic F127 , 5 mM MgATP , 50 nM actin chromobody - EmeraldFP , and an oxygen scavenging system ( 0 . 13 mg / mL glucose oxidase , 50 μg / mL catalase , and 3 mg / mL glucose ) , and passed twice through the flow chamber which was then immediately sealed with nail polish . Actin polymerization which was visualized by low concentrations of actin chromobody was imaged at 37°C in epifluorescence using a DeltaVision Elite microscope ( Cytiva ) built on an Olympus base with a 100x 1 . 39 NA objective and definite focus system . Images were acquired every 5 seconds for 5 to 30 minutes with a scientific CMOS camera and DV Insight solid state illumination module . Epifluorescence microscopy data processing Movies of actin growth were analyzed using the ImageJ plugin MTrackJ ( 62 ) . The rate of shrinkage or growth for each filament was determined by measuring the change in filament length at each end over the length of the 5 - minute movie . The length of TgAct1 or skeletal actin was converted to number of actin subunits in Excel with 2 . 76 or 2 . 74 nm length increase per subunit respectively ( 24 ) . Pauses in depolymerization at the pointed - end were excluded from rate determinations . Individual measurements were imported into GraphPad Prism ( GraphPad Software ver . 10 . 0 . 0 , Boston , Massachusetts USA ) for statistical analysis and graphing . Kymographs of actin dynamics were generated using the imageJ plugin multiplekymograph . Measuring the rate of dissociation of ethenoATP from actin For the preparation of ethenoATP ( εATP ) bound actin , TgAct1 or skeletal actin was clarified at 400 , 000 x g for 30 minutes and exchanged into G buffer as described above . Actin was diluted to 20 µM in 200 µL and calcium was exchanged with magnesium by simultaneously mixing in 0 . 2 mM EGTA and 80 µM MgCl 2 followed by incubating on ice for 5 minutes . Free ATP was depleted from solution by the addition of 10 µL DOWEX resin that was washed and equilibrated in a solution of 2 mM Tris pH 8 . 0 . The mixture was continuously inverted for 2 minutes and spun 12 , 000 RPM for 1 minute at room temperature to remove the resin . To the supernatant , 50 µM εATP ( Jena Bioscience ) was added and the mixture was incubated on ice for 30 minutes . For measuring 12 nucleotide exchange , 150 µL εATP actin was added to a 96 well plate and 50 µL of 2 mM MgATP was added using an auto injector in a SpectraMax® i3x plate reader . The plate was then simultaneously mixed and measured for fluorescence at 410 nm resulting in a delay time of 0 . 2 seconds after injection . Fluorescence readings were taken at 0 . 2 second intervals for 5 minutes . Time courses were fitted to single exponentials , yielding the nucleotide dissociation rate constant from the observed rate constant of the best fit . Actin Pi release assay TgAct1 or skeletal actin was clarified at 400 , 000 x g for 30 minutes and exchanged into fresh G buffer as described above . The actin solution was warmed for 30 seconds in a 37°C water bath and induced for polymerization by adding 10x polymerization buffer ( 250 mM Imidazole , pH 7 . 4 , 500 mM KCl , 20 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM EGTA , 2 mM MgATP , 10 mM DTT ) to a 1x final concentration at 37°C . The amount of Pi released from actin was measured by absorbance at 360 nm every 20 seconds for 30 minutes to 1 hour using an EnzChek phosphate assay kit ( Thermo Fisher ) ( 63 , 64 ) in a GENESYS™ 10 UV - Vis Spectrophotometer ( Thermo Scientific ) maintained at 37°C . Western blotting to determine the cellular actin concentration Cells were syringe released , counted , and harvested by centrifugation at 3 , 500 r . p . m . for 4 minutes in a benchtop centrifuge . Cells were washed in PBS , and boiled for 7 minutes in SDS - PAGE loading buffer . Cell lysates equivalent to 2 . 5 x 10 6 and 5 x 10 6 cells / lane were run on SDS - PAGE next to known amounts of purified TgAct1 ranging from 50 to 300 ng as determined by OD280 . Protein was then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane , blocked with blocking buffer ( 2 . 5 % non - fat milk in PBS ) and incubated with a 1 / 1000 dilution in blocking buffer of rabbit anti - actin - antibody ( Gift from Marcus Meissner ) which binds TgAct1 ( 8 ) . The blot was then washed , incubated with a 1 / 3000 dilution of goat anti - rabbit secondary antibody in blocking buffer conjugated to IRDye® 680RD ( LI - COR ) , washed , and imaged on a Typhoon imager ( Cytiva ) . Densitometry analysis was performed using imageJ to generate a standard curve of intensities from known actin concentrations and the ng amount of actin per lane was determined by a standard fit to the curve . Number of parasites per lane and cell volume determined previously ( 66 ) was used to calculate the cellular actin concentration . Preparation of rhodamine - labeled TgAct1 filaments TgAct1 was thawed and desalted twice into a storage buffer ( 5 mM Tris , pH 8 . 2 , 0 . 2 M ammonium acetate , 0 . 25 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 5 mM DTT , 0 . 25 mM Na 2 ATP , 4°C ) lacking DTT . The concentration of actin was determined by OD280 and Tetramethylrhodamine - 5 - Iodoacetamide Dihydroiodide ( 5 - TMRIA ) ( Fisher Scientific ) was added at a 1 : 1 molar ratio and incubated at 4°C overnight . The following day , 1 mM DTT was added to the mixture , clarified 400 , 000 x g for 30 minutes and applied to a Superdex 200 Increase 10 / 300 GL ( GE Healthcare ) gel filtration column equilibrated in G - buffer containing 0 . 2 M ammonium acetate . Fractions corresponding to monomeric actin were pooled , concentrated in an Amicon Ultra - 15 ( Millipore ) , snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at - 80°C . For generating rhodamine labeled actin filaments , labeled and unlabeled TgAct1 was clarified 400 , 000 x g for 30 minutes and the concentration was determined by OD280 . 1 µM labeled actin was mixed with 20 µM unlabeled actin ( 5 % labeled ) and induced for polymerization by adding 2x polymerization buffer without actin chromobody . The mixture was added to a NEM myosin - bound and blocked flow chamber and allowed to polymerize for 10 minutes at 37°C . The flow chamber was then flushed with polymerization buffer containing 50 nM actin chromobody and imaged using epifluorescence microscopy . The resulting actin filaments which were observed using the actin chromobody , produced sparse punctate rhodamine labeling indicating poor rhodamine - TgAct1 incorporation . The average rhodamine - TgAct1 incorporation was determined 13 by counting rhodamine - labeled monomers and dividing by the number of monomers in the filament which was determined using 2 . 74 nm length increase per subunit ( 24 ) ( Ext . Data Fig . 1 ) . Negative Stain Electron Microscopy Frozen TgAct1 aliquots were thawed at room temperature and then placed on ice . Samples were spun at 95k for 30 min at 4°C and the supernatant was desalted using Zeba spin desalting column ( 7K MWCO , Thermo Scientific ) equilibrated with G - buffer supplemented with 0 . 2 mM DTT and 0 . 2 mM Na - ATP . Polymerization was induced by diluting 10x polymerization buffer to 1x in 60 µM ( + / - 10 ) TgAct1 with additives depending on the condition . For TgAct1 + jasplakinolide : jasplakinolide was added to a final concentration of 33 µM ; for TgAct1 + ATP : 10 mM Mg - ATP was used in the 10x polymerization buffer for a final concentration of 1 mM with TgAct1 ; for TgAct1 + AMPPNP , Li / Na - AMPPNP was substituted for Mg - ATP in the 10x polymerization buffer for a final concentration of 0 . 1 mM with TgAct1 . Immediately after diluting polymerization buffer into TgAct1 , the samples were placed at 37°C and incubated for 1 hour ( TgAct1 + Jas ) , 45 minutes ( TgAct1 with AMPPNP ) , or samples were taken at time points ( TgAct1 with 1 mM ATP ) . Samples were diluted 10 - fold in 1x polymerization buffer or directly applied to glow - discharged continuous carbon film grids . Grids were then washed in ddH 2 O three times unless specified otherwise and negatively stained using 2 % uranyl formate . Samples were imaged using a FEI Morgagni operating at 100 kV and a Gatan Orius CCD camera with the software package Digital Micrograph ( v2 . 10 . 1282 . 0 ) , or using a FEI Tecnai G2 Spirit operating at 120 kV and a Gatan Ultrascan 4000 CCD camera with the software package Leginon ( v3 . 4 ) . Cryo - Electron Microscopy & Data Processing TgAct1 filaments were assembled as described above . TgAct1 + jasplakinolide was assembled and stored at 4°C overnight before grid application . TgAct1 was used immediately after a 20 min incubation at 37°C . Protein solutions were diluted to the concentrations listed in Data Table 1 using 1x polymerization buffer and immediately applied to glow - discharged , C - flat 2 / 2 holey - carbon EM grids ( Protochips Inc . ) , blotted from the front ( TgAct1 + jasplakinolide ) or back ( TgAct1 ) of the grid , and plunge - frozen in liquid ethane using a manual plunging apparatus at room temperature in a dehumidified room . Data collection was performed using an FEI Glacios ( equipped with a Gatan K3 Summit direct electron detector operating in CDS mode ) and an FEI Titan Krios transmission electron microscope operating at 300 kV ( equipped with a Gatan image filter ( GIF ) and post - GIF Gatan K3 Summit direct electron detector ) both using the software package Leginon ( 67 ) ( v3 . 5 ) . Movies were aligned , corrected for beam - induced motion and dose - weighted using the Relion ( 68 ) 4 . 0 implementation of MotionCor2 ( 69 ) ( v1 . 3 . 1 ) ; CTF parameters were initially estimated using CTFFind4 ( v4 . 1 . 10 ) ( 70 ) . Motion corrected micrographs were imported into cryoSPARC ( v4 ) CTF parameters were re - estimated using Patch CTF Estimation . Particles were picked using Filament Tracer ( 71 ) . Two rounds of 2D classification were used to remove noise , carbon edges , and poorly aligning particles , and the remaining particles were used in ab initio reconstruction and Helix Refinement . Initial helical parameters of - 167° twist and 27 Å rise were used ( 72 ) within a search space of 164 - 170° and 24 - 30 Å ; helical parameters were refined in all Helix Refinements . Additional rounds of Helix Refinement with dynamic masks and Local Refinement with a static mask surrounding three protomers of the filament were completed , interspersed with Global and Local CTF Refinement and map sharpening with resolution estimation ( FSC cutoff of 0 . 143 ) . For the TgAct1 dataset , the particles were signal subtracted to remove filament signal outside of the three central protomers prior to the final Local Refinement . The final refined , unsharpened maps were exported to Phenix ( v1 . 20 ) where density modification and additional resolution estimation was performed ( FSC cutoff of 0 . 5 ) ( 73 ) . Local resolution estimation was performed using cryoSPARC’s Local Resolution Estimation and Local Filtering . 14 Model Building PDB ID 6TU4 was used as an initial model for TgAct1 . The model was fitted with the correct residues and iteratively refined against both the filament and 3x protomer maps using a combination of ISOLDE ( 74 ) ( v1 . 5 ) in ChimeraX ( 75 ) ( v1 . 5 ) , Coot ( 76 ) ( v0 . 9 . 8 . 1 ) , and phenix . real _ space _ refine and phenix . validation _ cryoem in Phenix ( v1 . 20 ) ( 77 , 78 ) . The TgAct1 model was used as the initial model for the TgAct1 + jasplakinolide dataset . Image Generation and Calculations for Micrographs and Protein Models Negative stained micrographs were contrast adjusted , rotated , and cropped in Fiji ( v2 . 1 . 0 / 1 . 53c ) . Cryo electron micrographs were motion corrected in Relion’s implementation of MotionCorr2 and Gaussian filtered and contrast adjusted in Fiji . We used ChimeraX for : protein volume and model visualization , volume alignment ( Fit to Model tool or the “fit” command ) , model alignment ( Matchmaker tool or the “align” command ) , buried surface area calculations ( “measure buriedarea” command ) , hydrophobicity calculations ( “hydrophobic coloring” tool ) , and hydrogen bonds identification ( “hbond” tool ) . All electron micrograph image , volume , and protein model figures were assembled in Adobe Illustrator CC6 ( v26 . 0 . 1 ) .

A low barbed - end assembly rate and a high pointed - end disassembly rate leads to a high critical concentration for TgAct1 relative to skeletal actin - an effect mediated in part by changes within the D - loop of TgAct1 . Paired with the ability to rapidly exchange nucleotide , actin filaments in T . gondii rapidly treadmill at concentrations where skeletal actin filaments elongate . Change in rates of TgAct1 assembly , disassembly and nucleotide exchange compared to skeletal muscle actin are indicated in grey text . 28 Tables Table 1 : Summary of polymerization rate constants for TgAct1 and skeletal actin . Rate constants for the barbed ( + ) and pointed ( - ) end of TgAct1 and skeletal actin were determined from plots of assembly ( barbed - end ) or disassembly ( pointed - end ) rates versus actin concentration .
