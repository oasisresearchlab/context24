MVC administration for 3 days blocked ex vivo virus infection of LCs as well as subsequent virus transmission when dif - ferent R5 HIV strains , HIV AD8 and HIV JR - FL , were utilized for an additional six subjects ( n ¼ 3 for each strain , Figures 1 and 2 ) . These data demon - strate that oral administration of MVC for at least 3 days is capable of fully protecting HIV infection of LCs within epithelial tissue . These experiments provide perhaps the best proof - of - concept test for MVC as a potential PrEP drug , as it would be unethical to expose MVC - treated volunteers to HIV in vivo . As proven here , orally delivered MVC rapidly distri - butes to skin and functionally acts to block infection of relevant target cells , LCs , supporting randomized controlled trials of MVC as a PrEP therapy for individuals at high risk of becoming infected with HIV through sexual exposure .

Three variants of this disease have been described ; PPKP1 ( OMIM x 148600 , Buschke – Fischer – Brauer type ) is characterized by the progressive devel - opment of discrete areas of hyperkerato - sis on the palms and soles , followed by more extensive diffuse hyperkeratosis on the pressure - bearing areas of plantar skin . Linkage analyses of families affected by PPKP1 have previously identiﬁed a Accepted article preview online 6 June 2013 ; published online 11 July 2013 Abbreviations : AAGAB , gene encoding alpha - and gamma - adaptin - binding protein p34 ; bp , base pair ; OMIM , Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man ; PPK ( P ) , ( punctate ) palmoplantar keratoderma ; RTK , receptor tyrosine kinase E Po¨hler et al . AAGAB Mutations in Punctate PPK www . jidonline . org 2805 locus within 15q22 – q24 ( Martinez - Mir et al . , 2003 ; Gao et al . , 2005 ) , but two Chinese pedigrees with a PPKP1 phenotype demonstrated linkage on chromosome 8q24 . 13 – q24 . 21 ( Zhang et al . , 2004 ) . Recently , nonsense muta - tions in AAGAB , the gene encoding alpha - and gamma - adaptin - binding protein p34 , were reported in three PPKP1 families ( Giehl et al . , 2012 ) . Simultaneously , we applied whole - exome sequencing and reported heter - ozygous loss - of - function mutations in AAGAB in 18 PPKP1 kindreds ( Pohler et al . , 2012 ) . AAGAB is located on chromosome 15q22 , within one of the previously reported linkage regions ( Martinez - Mir et al . , 2003 ; Pohler et al . , 2012 ) . We now report the AAGAB genotype in a further 12 PPKP1 patients from 6 independent kindreds of Scottish , English , and Mexican ancestry . This study was carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki Principles , and all subjects gave written informed consent . KINDRED 1 A 56 - year - old Scottish woman reported a 15 - year history of the progressive devel - opment of tender callosities on her soles and palms . Examination revealed multiple hyperkeratotic foci on the palmar skin of hands and ﬁngers ( Figure 1a ) and diffuse hyperkeratosis on weight - bearing areas of plantar skin ( Figure 1b ) . The proband’s parents were unaffected , but one of her three offspring demonstrated a PPKP1 phenotype . Sequencing of AAGAB using reported methodology ( Pohler et al . , 2012 ) identiﬁed a heterozygous 1 - bp deletion , mutation c . 344del resulting in a premature termination codon ( p . Asp115Valfs * 7 ; Supplementary Figure S1 online ) . This mutation has previously been observed in two apparently unrelated Scottish families ( Pohler et al . , 2012 ) . KINDRED 2 A 74 - year - old Scottish woman pre - sented with a 25 - year history of progres - sive hyperkeratosis of her plantar skin ( Figure 1d ) , with lesser involvement of the palmar skin ( Figure 1c ) . The pro - band’s parents were unaffected , but one of her three adult children had keratoderma . DNA sequencing identiﬁed a previously unreported heterozygous nonsense mutation , c . 390G 4 A , pre - dicting the protein change p . Trp130 * 0 , within AAGAB ( Supplementary Figures S1 and S2b online ) . This mutation was not detected in B 11 , 000 European and African American individuals’ exome sequencing data ( NHLBI Exome Seq - uencing Project http : / / evs . gs . washington . edu / EVS / accessed 27 March 2013 ) , nor is it reported in the 1000 Genomes Catalogue of Human Genetic Variation ( http : / / www . 1000genomes . org / ensembl - browser accessed 27 March 2013 ) . KINDRED 3 A 79 - year - old Scottish man presented with a 30 - year history of hyperkeratosis of the soles and palms ( Supplementary Figure S3a and b online ) . His medical history included a cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma on the hand and a basal cell carcinoma on the nose , but these were not at sites affected by kerato - derma . The patient’s parents , eight sib - lings , and two children were unaffected . DNA sequencing revealed a heterozy - gous c . 870 þ 1G 4 A splice - site muta - tion within AAGAB ( Supplementary Figure S1 online ) , previously reported in an unrelated Scottish family ( Pohler et al . , 2012 ) . The protein conse - quences of this mutation are unknown but is likely to represent a frameshift mutation . a b c d e f g h Figure 1 . Clinical images of punctate palmoplantar keratoderma cases .

AAGAB Mutations in Punctate PPK 2806 Journal of Investigative Dermatology ( 2013 ) , Volume 133 KINDRED 4 A 55 - year - old female patient of English ancestry presented at the age of 30 years with typical features of PPKP1 . She had multiple keratotic papules on palmar and plantar surfaces , which had gradu - ally increased in number , becoming conﬂuent and tender ( Supplementary Figure S4a and b online ) . The patient has one affected and four unaffected siblings ; her two daughters are similarly affected and her one grandson shows early signs of punctate keratoderma . DNA sequencing revealed a heterozy - gous frameshift mutation c . 472del , leading to a premature termination codon ( p . Gly158Glufs * 0 ; Supplemen - tary Figure S1 online ) , previously reported in ﬁve apparently unrelated Scottish families ( Pohler et al . , 2012 ) . KINDRED 5 Thirty - one members of this Mexican family over four generations demon - strate a PPK1P phenotype with an auto - somal dominant pattern of inheritance . The affected living relatives showed multiple hyperkeratotic papules on the palms and soles with no associated nail disease ( representative clinical images are shown in Figure 1e and f ) . Linkage analysis in this family has identiﬁed the AAGAB locus at chromosome 15q22 ( Martinez - Mir et al . , 2003 ) . AAGAB sequencing of DNA from ﬁve affected family members has now identiﬁed a previously unreported heterozygous 1 - bp deletion in exon 3 , c . 275del predicting the protein change p . Leu92Leufs * 18 , in each affected individual ( Supplementary Figures S1 and S2d online ) . This mutation was not detected in B 11 , 000 European and African American individuals’ exome sequencing data ( NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project http : / / evs . gs . washington . edu / EVS / accessed 27 March 2013 ) , nor is it reported in the 1000 Genomes Catalogue of Human Genetic Variation ( http : / / www . 1000genomes . org / ensembl - browser accessed 27 March 2013 ) . KINDRED 6 A 42 - year - old Scottish woman pre - sented with punctate callosities affecting her palms and soles , which were present since early adulthood ( Figure 1g and h ) . The proband’s mother was affected to a milder degree , and her 15 - year - old son showed early signs of punctate kerato - derma on the plantar surfaces . Sequen - cing of all exons of AAGAB in these three cases failed to identify any muta - tions . However , microsatellite linkage analysis in the pedigree was consistent with involvement of the AAGAB locus ( Figure 2 ) . Hemizygous inheritance of a microsatellite marker within intron 1 of AAGAB indicated a genomic deletion . A reduction in the gene dosage for AAGAB exon 1 in the proband compared with her unaffected father was conﬁrmed using semiquantitative ﬂuorescent PCR ( Supplementary Figure S5a and b online ) , whereas exons 2 and 3 were ampliﬁed in equal quantities in the proband and control ( Supplementary Figure S5c and d online ) . The precise size of this genomic deletion involving exon 1 / intron 1 of AAGAB has not been deﬁned , but it is consistent with the resultant haploinsuf - ﬁciency of AAGAB . It has previously been shown that knockdown of p34 in HaCaT cells in vitro leads to increased stabilization of the EGFR protein , a receptor tyrosine kinase ( Pohler et al . , 2012 ) . In addition to EGFR , keratinocytes express several other receptor tyrosine kinases ( RTKs ) . To further investigate the functional effects of AAGAB mutations , we tested the effect of gene knockdown on the transmembrane protein Axl , an RTK that is highly expressed in skin and is involved in signaling pathways to cellular proliferation ( Postel - Vinay and Ashworth , 2012 ) . We investigated the effect of p34 knockdown on Axl in HaCaT keratinocytes and found a signiﬁcant increase in the amount of Axl protein in cells treated with AAGAB - speciﬁc small interfering RNA ( Supplementary Figure S6 online ; methods are fully described in online Supplementary Tables S1 and S2 online ) . These six kindreds demonstrate repli - cation of a newly reported genetic cause for punctate PPK1 , further conﬁrming AAGAB as a causative gene . AAGAB mutations result in hereditary deﬁciency of p34 , leading to hyperproliferative hyperkeratosis through increased growth factor signaling , which is thought to result from impairment in the endocy - tosis and recycling of EGFR proteins ( Pohler et al . , 2012 ) . A total of 13 predicted loss - of - func - tion mutations have now been reported ; these are listed in Supplementary Table S3 online . We have identiﬁed recurrent mutations resulting in frameshift and deleterious splice site changes , as well as previously unreported variants . There is no apparent genotype – phenotype correlation within this small group of patients , but our clinical observation is that environmental factors and personal skin care regimes affect the degree of plantar hyperkeratosis . The PPKP1 families reported here demonstrate some diversity in the clinical appear - ance of plantar hyperkeratosis , whereas the punctate palmar keratoses have a more similar appearance in each kindred ( Figure 1 ) . An association with the development of malignancy in PPKP1 patients has AAGAB _ intron 1 AAGAB _ intron 5 ( 370 , 373 ) AAGAB _ intron 1 ( 301 , - - - ) AAGAB _ intron 5 ( 370 , 405 ) ( 373 , 373 ) ( 308 , - - - ) ( 301 , 301 ) ( 380 , 382 ) ( 301 , 301 ) ( 301 , 308 ) ( 373 , 405 ) Figure 2 . Family tree and microsatellite markers showing linkage patterns in kindred 6 . Two regions of microsatellite repeats were screened : one marker within intron 5 and a second marker within intron 1 of AAGAB . Numbers indicate the length ( in base pairs ) of PCR products for each marker from each allele . The microsatellite marker of intron 1 is absent from one allele of AAGAB in PPKP1 - affected individuals , indicating a genomic deletion resulting in hemizygosity . E Po¨hler et al . AAGAB Mutations in Punctate PPK www . jidonline . org 2807 been reported , including breast and colonic adenocarcinoma ( Bennion and Patterson , 1984 ; Stevens et al . , 1996 ) . It is not clear whether there is truly an over - representation of malignancy in PPKP1 cases , and malignant neoplasms were not prevalent in the six kindreds reported here . Hyperkeratosis of the plantar skin localized to the weight - bearing areas may be explained by mechanical trauma , but the extremely focal distribu - tion of hyperkeratosis on the palmar skin in the disorder is striking . The mechanism ( s ) responsible for producing this very focal disease on the back - ground of a mutation expressed through - out the palmar skin are likely to be of clinical relevance , but they remain to be deﬁned . It is possible that a second mutation has occurred within each focal area of hyperkeratosis . This was not identiﬁed by microdissection and sequence analysis ( Pohler et al . , 2012 ) , but further investigation is warranted . A clearer understanding of the genetic and / or environmental mechanisms by which focal keratoses arise may give further insight into the role of p34 in controlling cell division . Because of the role of EGFR and Axl in various malignancies , Axl - speciﬁc inhibitors are under development ( Postel - Vinay and Ashworth , 2012 ) and are potentially of relevance to this rare but distressing keratoderma . The p34 protein encoded by AAGAB has been functionally implicated in the biology of intracellular transport of membrane - bound , clathrin - coated vesi - cles . We hypothesized that a possible link between an inherited defect in vesicle transport and epidermal hyper - proliferation might involve RTKs , which are turned over by endocytosis via clathrin - and AP2 - dependent processes ( Ceresa , 2006 ; Rappoport and Simon , 2009 ) . The upregulation of Axl protein expression after small interfering RNA knockdown of AAGAB demon - strates the involvement of p34 in RTK turnover in addition to EGFR . The identiﬁcation of molecular mechanisms in palmoplantar keratoderma serves to improve our understanding of the patho - genesis of cutaneous hyperkeratosis . It may also offer insight into the control of keratinization in physiologi - cal conditions , as well as more prevalent inﬂammatory skin diseases characterized by hyperproliferation and hyperkeratosis .
