However , to date there are no reliable biomarkers that categorize those SCC patients that will progress to metastasis . Nuclear active IKK a diminishes Maspin levels in prostate cancer facili - tating its metastatic potential . In this paper , we describe the immunohistochemical analysis of active IKK and Maspin in 56 metastasizing and 51 non - metastasizing primary cSCC to measure their association with cancer behaviour . We also determined the effect of inhibiting IKK activity in SCC cell growth and migration in vitro . We found that high levels of nuclear active IKK in the primary tumour are predictive of cSCC metastatic capacity , in particular when combined with poor tumour differentiation and a history of tumour recurrence . Active IKK inversely correlated with Maspin levels in cSCC tumours , and samples negative for Maspin are exclusively found in the metastatic group . Mechanistically , IKK activity regulates cellular motility and SCC cell survival . Our results indicate that nuclear active IKK is a robust biomarker to predict cSCC outcome , and suggest the possibility of targeting IKK activity as a future therapy for treating metastatic cSCC . Keywords Biomarkers (cid:2) Cutaneous (cid:2) IKK (cid:2) Lymph nodes (cid:2) Maspin (cid:2) Metastasis (cid:2) Squamous cell carcinoma Introduction Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma ( cSCC ) is the second most common malignancy in humans with an incidence of 16 per 100 , 000 people in Europe [ 40 ] . Approximately , 4 – 5 % of cSCC metastasize [ 3 , 20 , 37 ] with most of the metastases spreading ﬁrst to a single regional lymph node [ 15 ] . The presence of lymph node metastases is critical to deﬁne the patient’s outcome , and its detection predicts a 10 - year survival rate below 20 % . Several factors have been associated with an increased risk of metastasis , such as immunosuppression , tumour thickness ( [ 4 mm ) , desmoplasia , horizontal size greater than 2 cm , poor dif - ferentiation , localization of the primary tumour to speciﬁc sites such as the ear and lips , or increased proliferation ratio of tumour cells [ 10 , 36 , 37 ] . Tumour relapse is also an independent parameter that predicts cSCC metastasis [ 10 , 43 , 44 ] ; however , there is still a lack of reliable biomarkers that categorize individuals with higher risk of developing cancer relapse and / or metastasis . Such biomarkers would allow the identiﬁcation of patients that would beneﬁt from the implementation of more accurate follow - up schedules , imaging procedures and / or lymph node biopsy protocols . Activation of NF j B and the IKK complex is commonly found associated with inﬂammation - related cancers and is responsible for the promotion of tumour cell survival and A . Toll and P .

The IKK complex is composed of IKK a , IKK b and NEMO , being the IKK b subunit essential for NF - j B activation and for the regulation of the immune system and organism ﬁtness [ 8 , 12 , 22 ] . IKK a is not required for these functions , but it is necessary to signal through the alternative NF - j B pathway ( that signals through the p52 / RelB heterodimer ) , and to phosphorylate speciﬁc nuclear substrates such as histone H3 , SMRT and N - CoR thus facilitating NF - j B - dependent and NF - j B - independent transcription [ 6 , 7 , 16 , 17 , 27 , 48 ] . In a mouse model for prostate cancer , nuclear active IKK a represses transcription of the anti - metastatic gene Maspin by direct binding to its promoter region . Elimination of IKK a activity in prostate cancer cells is sufﬁcient to increase Maspin levels , thus inhibiting their metastatic potential [ 25 ] . Consistent with a role in epider - mal homeostasis , IKK a functions as a cofactor for Smad2 / 3 in a Smad4 - independent pathway that inhibits ker - atinocyte proliferation [ 13 , 28 ] . Consequently , IKK a deﬁ - cient mice display a hyperplasic epidermal phenotype [ 29 , 42 ] , whereas animals overexpressing IKK a in the supra - basal skin compartment showed increased epidermal dif - ferentiation and are resistant to chemically induced SCC [ 23 ] . In the same direction , truncating ( inactivating ) mutations in the IKK a gene are consistently found in human and mouse SCC lesions [ 32 ] . Unexpectedly , we and others recently demonstrated that IKK a activity is signiﬁ - cantly increased in a set of human SCC samples [ 29 , 30 ] . We here investigate whether IKK activity inﬂuences cSCC behaviour , and which is the effect of targeting IKK in this particular cancer cell type . Materials and methods Patients Records from six tertiary care centers were searched to identify patients who had developed MSCCs between 2001 and 2011 . Fifty - six primary metastasizing cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas ( MSCCs ) that had evolved to histologically conﬁrmed lymph node or cutaneous in - transit metastases ( 51 and 5 cases , respectively ) were included in the study . Thirty - nine metastases from 39 patients were also evaluated . A control group of ﬁfty - one patients with cSCCs who had not developed any metastasis ( non - MSCCs ) in a 5 - year follow - up period was also included in the study . All the tumours were excised with conventional surgery . The tumour that had immediately preceded the metastasis was selected in patients from the MSCC group that had developed one or more recurrences . SCCs developing on mucosal surfaces were excluded from the study . Approval to conduct this study was obtained from the ethics committees from all the hospitals partici - pating in the study , and in accordance with the guidelines of the Helsinki Declaration of 1975 , as revised in 1983 . The following clinical data were recorded for each patient : gender , age , immunosuppression status , year of diagnosis , recurrences , tumour size and location . Tumour ( T1 , T2 , T3 , T4 ) staging according to the 7th AJCC classiﬁcation was also registered [ 15 ] . Histopathological evaluation Two evaluators ( Javier Gimeno and Agustı´ Toll ) simulta - neously analyzed each sample and registered the following histopathological features using hematoxylin and eosin stained slides : tumour differentiation ( well , moderately , poorly ) , tumour thickness , desmoplasia ( as previously reported in [ 10 ] , vascular and perineural invasion . The presence of an inﬁltrative pattern was also recorded . Tissue microarray After pathological review , the invasive edge of the tumour was selected for the construction of tissue microarrays ( TMAs ) . Nine tissue microarrays were constructed as previously reported [ 44 ] . Two tissue cylinders with a diameter of 2 mm were punched from the selected areas from each tissue block and brought into a recipient parafﬁn block using the tissue microarrayer ( Arrayer Punch set 2 . 00 mm . ATA200 , Advanced Tissue Arrayer , Chemicon International ) . Antibodies and immunohistochemical ( IHC ) staining The antibody recognizing P - IKK a - Ser180 / IKK b - Ser181 was sc - 23470 , antibody against IKK a was sc - 7184 , and antibody to IKK b was sc - 7329 , all three from Santa Cruz Biotechnology . Antibody recognizing Maspin was sc - 2762 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology . Parafﬁn - embedded 4 - l m - thick sections of the tissue microarray blocks were processed following standard methods . Antigen retrieval was done overnight in citrate buffer ( pH 6 . 0 ) at 80 (cid:3) C and primary antibodies incubated overnight in PBS / 0 . 3 % Triton - X100 . Primary antibody was detected using the Universal DAKO kit and developed with DAB peroxidase substrate kit ( DakoCytomation ) or Alexa ﬂuorescent secondary anti - bodies ( Molecular probes ) . Hematoxylin and eosin staining was performed using standard protocols . Images were cap - tured using the Olympus BX61 and the Cell ^ B software ( Olympus ) . Two observers ( Agustı´ Toll and Pol Margalef ) independently scored the IHC staining . The nuclear and / or cytoplasmic levels of active IKK ( P - IKK ) as well as total Maspin levels were graded as 1 ? , 2 ? or 3 ? . 722 Arch Dermatol Res ( 2015 ) 307 : 721 – 729 123 Cell lines cultures and viral production A431 cells , derived from a human squamous cell carci - noma , were obtained from the ATCC depository , and grown in DMEM plus 10 % FBS . Recombinant len - tiviruses were produced by transient transfection of HEK - 293T cells according to Tronolab protocols ( http : / / tronolab . epﬂ . ch / page58122 . html ) . 20 l g of transfer vector , 15 l g of packaging plasmid ( psPAX2 ) , and 6 l g of envelope plas - mid ( pMD2 . G ) were used . After 3 days , supernatant was ultracentrifuged and viral pellet resuspended in 100 l l of PBS . 20 l l of fresh viral suspension was used per infection . Wound healing assay A431 cells were cultured until conﬂuence and then wounded using a yellow pipette tip . Different treatments such as BAY11 - 7082 , BAY65 - 5811 and Aurothiomalate in A431 cells were then applied . Migration distance was photographed and measured at zero time , after 8 h and after 24 h . Results Multivariate analysis of prognostic markers : activation of IKK associates with tumour outcome By IHC analysis of 107 human samples , we found that cSCC from patients who developed lymph node metastases in a 5 - year - follow - up period shows higher levels of nuclear P - IKK than those from patients who had not developed metastasis ( Fig . 1a , b ) . Mean P - IKK grading was 1 . 962 and 1 . 078 for metastasizing tumours and non - metastasizing tumours , respectively ( P \ 0 . 001 ) . Using speciﬁc anti - bodies to either IKK isoform , we exclusively found IKK a in the nucleus of SCC cells indicating that phosphorylated IKK in these tumors corresponds to activated IKK a ( Fig . 1c ) . Moreover , levels of nuclear active IKK remained elevated in the metastases ( Fig . 1d ) . In a multivariate analysis of the primary cSCC we only identiﬁed 3 independent factors that were associated with the development of lymph node metastases : poor histopathologic differentiation , clinical recurrence and nuclear P - IKK levels . The value of these 3 parameters as predictors of metastasis was evaluated with a receiver operating characteristic curve ( ROC ) . The area under the ROC for these variables was 0 . 893 ( 95 % CI 0 . 833 – 0 . 954 ; P \ 001 ) , which indicates that together these parameters identify more than 90 % of all patients that will develop metastasis . Equally important , primary cSCC tumours with highest nuclear P - IKK levels ( 3 ? as a single independent parameter ) categorized patients with a 21 - fold increased probability of developing metastasis compared with those carrying tumours that were negative for IKK activity . Based on our results , we have generated a mathematic method that predicts ( up to a 99 . 25 % ) the probability of an SCC ‘‘ i ’’ patient to develop metastasis based on tumour differentiation , clinical recurrence and nuclear P - IKK levels : p i ¼ 1 1 þ e (cid:3)ð(cid:3) 4 : 553 þ 3 : 192 (cid:2) x 1 ; i þ 2 : 284 (cid:2) x 2 ; i þ 3 : 191 (cid:2) x 3 ; i þ 2 : 027 (cid:2) x 4 ; i þ 2 : 485 (cid:2) x 5 ; i þ 3 : 054 (cid:2) x 6 ; i where x 1 : 0 if not case recurrent , 1 if yes . x 2 : 1 if moderate differentiated , 0 otherwise . x 3 : 1 if poorly differentiated , 0 otherwise . x 4 : 1 if nuclear P - IKK intensity is one cross , 0 otherwise . x 5 : 1 if two crosses , 0 otherwise . x 6 : 1 if three crosses , 0 otherwise . Protein levels of Maspin are reduced in metastatic SCC tumours As mentioned , the anti - metastatic gene Maspin is nega - tively regulated by nuclear active IKK a in prostate cancer cells . Thus , we predicted that activated IKK might be repressing Maspin in our group of metastatic cSCC . By IHC , we detected variable levels of the Maspin protein in both metastatic and non - metastatic samples ( Fig . 2a , b ) . However , the highest Maspin levels ( ? ? ? ) were consis - tently found in the non - metastatic samples , whereas all Maspin - negative samples were distributed in the primary lesion of the metastatic group ( Fig . 2b ) , and also in the metastases ( not depicted ) . In addition , we did ﬁnd a sig - niﬁcant inverse correlation ( P = 0 . 002 ) between nuclear active IKK and Maspin protein levels in our samples ( Fig . 2c ) . Targeting IKK promotes apoptosis and reduces cSCC cell migration We next determined the levels of nuclear phosphorylated IKK in a panel of SCC cell lines . We found that SCC - derived A431 cells , previously tested for their invasiveness and metastatic capacity in vivo [ 46 , 49 ] , show high levels of activated IKK in the nucleus mainly corresponding to the previously identiﬁed p45 - IKK a isoform ( Fig . 3a ) , compared with the low amounts of activated full - length IKK a or b ( 85 / 87 kDa , respectively ) . Transduction of A431 cells with two different shRNAs against IKK a imposed a signiﬁcant reduction of phosphorylated p45 - IKK a amounts associated with an increased in Maspin protein levels ( Fig . 3a ) , and a signiﬁcant reduction in cell growth ( Fig . 3b ) . We next tested the effect of pharmaco - logic inhibitors of the IKK activity such as BAY11 - 7082 , BAY65 - 5811 and Aurothiomalate in A431 cells . Treatment with these inhibitors for 72 h resulted in a dose - dependent Arch Dermatol Res ( 2015 ) 307 : 721 – 729 723 123 reduction in cell growth , comparable to IKK a knockdown ( Fig . 3c ) , likely as a result of increased apoptosis as determined by AnexinV binding ( Fig . 3d ) . In addition , we determined whether IKK activity regulates cell motility in A431 cells . In a wound - healing assay , we found that IKK inhibition with BAY11 - 7082 and BAY65 - 5811 , and to a Fig . 1 Activation of IKK associates with worse tumour outcome . a P - IKK immunohistochemicalexpression ( - ; ? , ? ? , ? ? ? ) in different subtypes of cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas ( non - metastatic , metastatic and metastases ) . b – c IHC analysis of P - IKK a / b levels using human tissue micro - array that contain 107 cSCC samples . b Representative images showing PIKK a / b detection in 3 metastasizing and 3 non - metastasizing primary tumours . c IHC analysis of IKK a and IKK b distribution in 2 randomly selected metastasizing samples . d Expression of P - IKK a / b in 2 metastatic lesions from patients shown in b .

Importantly , the reduction in cell migration imposed by the IKK inhibitors was previous to their effect on cell survival ( not shown ) . Together our results indicate that activation of nuclear IKK , in particular IKK a , is a common event in cSCC , and it is predictive of higher metastatic capacity and worse patient outcome in combination with two addi - tional parameters : low tumour differentiation and recur - rence . Repression of Maspin by nuclear phosphorylated IKK a is the possible mechanism linking IKK and metastasis in cSCC , which is consistent with the obser - vation that IKK activity inhibition reduced tumor cell growth and motility related with an increase in the levels of Maspin protein . Discussion Approximately , 4 % of patients with cSCC develop nodal metastases , but the efﬁcacy of current therapeutic modali - ties for metastatic cSCC is limited and most of these patients die due to disease progression . The group of Fig . 1 continued Arch Dermatol Res ( 2015 ) 307 : 721 – 729 725 123 tumours with an increased metastatic risk ( termed high - risk SCC ) has not been well deﬁned , although The American Joint Committee on Cancer includes the following parameters to consider high - risk SCC : tumour diameter larger than 2 cm , poor cellular differentiation , depth of invasion more than 2 mm or to the reticular dermis , per - ineural invasion , or ear or mucosal lip location [ 14 ] . An alternative staging system that better predicts metastatic risk has recently been proposed [ 21 , 36 ] . According to this staging , T2b tumours are those that fulﬁll 2 or 3 risk factors such as tumour diameter of 2 cm or greater , poorly dif - ferentiated histological characteristics , perineural invasion and tumour invasion beyond the subcutaneous fat . T2b tumours are associated with positive sentinel lymph node in 29 . 4 % of the cases [ 19 , 36 ] . Yet , between 20 and 30 % of metastatic SCCs lack any of the features described above , indicating the necessity of new molecular biomarkers that identify individuals with higher risk of cancer relapse and metastasis at early stages of cancer development . In this sense , epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) overexpression has been associated with metastatic potential in cSCC [ 11 ] , but it is also frequently found in non - metastatic cSCC and its utility as a prognostic marker is controversial [ 41 ] . CKS1B gene ampliﬁcation ( determined by ﬂuorescence in situ hybridization ) has also been associated with metastatic risk in cSCC [ 35 ] , and we previously reported an association between the expression of epithelial to mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) markers and the risk of lymph node metastasis . However , we found that EMT proteins that are upregulated in the primary aggres - sive tumours are subsequently repressed in the metastases , which preclude their use as therapeutic targets [ 44 ] . We now show that the nuclear active IKK is a good indicator of metastatic risk both as an independent parameter and together with the degree of differentiation and recurrence . Equally important , the fact that nuclear IKK activation is maintained in the lymph node metastases opens the pos - sibility of using IKK inhibitors to treat patients with metastatic cSCCs . However , since IKK activity is also essential for multiple physiological functions in the organism [ 18 , 24 , 26 , 31 , 33 , 34 , 50 ] , and most IKK inhibitors do not show any isoform speciﬁcity , novel compounds ( working at lower IC50 range if possible ) should be speciﬁcally designed for therapeutic purpose .

Although we have not determined yet whether p45 - IKK a is also responsible for nuclear IKK activity in primary human cSCC tumours , we propose that molecules speciﬁcally targeting IKK a and / or its processing into p45 - IKK a could represent a future therapy for treating metastatic cSCC .

However , Maspin protein has also been linked with recurrence and metastatic risk in breast [ 38 , 51 ] , colorectal [ 39 ] and bladder cancer [ 2 ] , and elevated Maspin levels correlates with good prognosis in esophageal [ 45 ] and oral SCC [ 47 ] . Moreover , a decreased expression of Maspin has recently been demonstrated to correlate with an increased malignancy of mouse and human tumor epi - dermal cells [ 4 , 5 ] . We here found that Maspin protein , previously detected in approximately 28 % of cSCC [ 1 ] , is consistently reduced in metastatic cSCC negatively corre - lating with nuclear IKK activation . These results suggest a mechanistic explanation for the observed link between nuclear active IKK and metastatic risk in cSCC , although we do not exclude that other downstream effectors of nuclear IKK [ 27 ] can regulate tumour cell survival and proliferation in this type of cancer . In conclusion , and taking into account the possible limitations of our study ( i . e . samples were retrospectively obtained from several centers and immunohistochemistry was performed in 2 - mm cylinders , which could render non - representative results in tumours with heterogeneous areas ) , our results indicate that active nuclear IKK is coupled with the metastatic capacity of cSCC , likely through Maspin attenuation . Thus , immunohistochemical detection of nuclear P - IKK and Maspin that could be easily incorporated in the pathology laboratories would represent a novel diagnostic tool with prognostic value for this speciﬁc type of cancer . In addition , the persistence of P - IKK positivity suggests that nuclear IKK activity is functionally relevant in the lymph node metastases , which might have future therapeutic implications in metastatic cSCC .
